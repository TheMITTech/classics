<A NAME="10"></A><B>Proem</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Mother of Rome, delight of Gods and men,
<A NAME="12"></A><BR>Dear Venus that beneath the gliding stars
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>Makest to teem the many-voyaged main
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>And fruitful lands- for all of living things
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>Through thee alone are evermore conceived,
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>Through thee are risen to visit the great sun-
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>Before thee, Goddess, and thy coming on,
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>Flee stormy wind and massy cloud away,
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>For thee the daedal Earth bears scented flowers,
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>For thee waters of the unvexed deep
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>Smile, and the hollows of the serene sky
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>Glow with diffused radiance for thee!
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>For soon as comes the springtime face of day,
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>And procreant gales blow from the West unbarred,
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>First fowls of air, smit to the heart by thee,
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>Foretoken thy approach, O thou Divine,
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>And leap the wild herds round the happy fields
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>Or swim the bounding torrents. Thus amain,
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>Seized with the spell, all creatures follow thee
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>Whithersoever thou walkest forth to lead,
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>And thence through seas and mountains and swift 
<A NAME="32"></A>streams,
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>Through leafy homes of birds and greening plains,
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>Kindling the lure of love in every breast,
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>Thou bringest the eternal generations forth,
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>Kind after kind. And since 'tis thou alone
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>Guidest the Cosmos, and without thee naught
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>Is risen to reach the shining shores of light,
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>Nor aught of joyful or of lovely born,
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>Thee do I crave co-partner in that verse
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>Which I presume on Nature to compose
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>For Memmius mine, whom thou hast willed to be
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>Peerless in every grace at every hour-
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>Wherefore indeed, Divine one, give my words
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>Immortal charm. Lull to a timely rest
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>O'er sea and land the savage works of war,
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>For thou alone hast power with public peace
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>To aid mortality; since he who rules
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>The savage works of battle, puissant Mars,
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>How often to thy bosom flings his strength
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>O'ermastered by the eternal wound of love-
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>And there, with eyes and full throat backward thrown,
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>Gazing, my Goddess, open-mouthed at thee,
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>Pastures on love his greedy sight, his breath
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>Hanging upon thy lips. Him thus reclined
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>Fill with thy holy body, round, above!
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>Pour from those lips soft syllables to win
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>Peace for the Romans, glorious Lady, peace!
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>For in a season troublous to the state
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>Neither may I attend this task of mine
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>With thought untroubled, nor mid such events
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>The illustrious scion of the Memmian house
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>Neglect the civic cause.
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>Whilst human kind
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>Throughout the lands lay miserably crushed
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>Before all eyes beneath Religion- who
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>Would show her head along the region skies,
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>Glowering on mortals with her hideous face-
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>A Greek it was who first opposing dared
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>Raise mortal eyes that terror to withstand,
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>Whom nor the fame of Gods nor lightning's stroke
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>Nor threatening thunder of the ominous sky
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>Abashed; but rather chafed to angry zest
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>His dauntless heart to be the first to rend
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>The crossbars at the gates of Nature old.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>And thus his will and hardy wisdom won;
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>And forward thus he fared afar, beyond
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>The flaming ramparts of the world, until
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>He wandered the unmeasurable All.
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>Whence he to us, a conqueror, reports
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>What things can rise to being, what cannot,
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>And by what law to each its scope prescribed,
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>Its boundary stone that clings so deep in Time.
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>Wherefore Religion now is under foot,
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>And us his victory now exalts to heaven.
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>I know how hard it is in Latian verse
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>To tell the dark discoveries of the Greeks,
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>Chiefly because our pauper-speech must find
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>Strange terms to fit the strangeness of the thing;
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>Yet worth of thine and the expected joy
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>Of thy sweet friendship do persuade me on
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>To bear all toil and wake the clear nights through,
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>Seeking with what of words and what of song
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>I may at last most gloriously uncloud
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>For thee the light beyond, wherewith to view
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>The core of being at the centre hid.
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>And for the rest, summon to judgments true,
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>Unbusied ears and singleness of mind
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>Withdrawn from cares; lest these my gifts, arranged
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>For thee with eager service, thou disdain
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>Before thou comprehendest: since for thee
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>I prove the supreme law of Gods and sky,
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>And the primordial germs of things unfold,
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>Whence Nature all creates, and multiplies
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>And fosters all, and whither she resolves
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>Each in the end when each is overthrown.
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>This ultimate stock we have devised to name
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>Procreant atoms, matter, seeds of things,
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>Or primal bodies, as primal to the world.
<A NAME="110"></A><BR><BR>I fear perhaps thou deemest that we fare
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>An impious road to realms of thought profane;
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>But 'tis that same religion oftener far
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>Hath bred the foul impieties of men:
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>As once at Aulis, the elected chiefs,
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>Foremost of heroes, Danaan counsellors,
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>Defiled Diana's altar, virgin queen,
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>With Agamemnon's daughter, foully slain.
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>She felt the chaplet round her maiden locks
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>And fillets, fluttering down on either cheek,
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>And at the altar marked her grieving sire,
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>The priests beside him who concealed the knife,
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>And all the folk in tears at sight of her.
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>With a dumb terror and a sinking knee
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>She dropped; nor might avail her now that first
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>'Twas she who gave the king a father's name.
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>They raised her up, they bore the trembling girl
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>On to the altar- hither led not now
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>With solemn rites and hymeneal choir,
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>But sinless woman, sinfully foredone,
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>A parent felled her on her bridal day,
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>Making his child a sacrificial beast
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>To give the ships auspicious winds for Troy:
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>Such are the crimes to which Religion leads.
<A NAME="134"></A><BR><BR>And there shall come the time when even thou,
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>Forced by the soothsayer's terror-tales, shalt seek
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>To break from us. Ah, many a dream even now
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>Can they concoct to rout thy plans of life,
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>And trouble all thy fortunes with base fears.
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>I own with reason: for, if men but knew
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>Some fixed end to ills, they would be strong
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>By some device unconquered to withstand
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>Religions and the menacings of seers.
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>But now nor skill nor instrument is theirs,
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>Since men must dread eternal pains in death.
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>For what the soul may be they do not know,
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>Whether 'tis born, or enter in at birth,
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>And whether, snatched by death, it die with us,
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>Or visit the shadows and the vasty caves
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>Of Orcus, or by some divine decree
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>Enter the brute herds, as our Ennius sang,
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>Who first from lovely Helicon brought down
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>A laurel wreath of bright perennial leaves,
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>Renowned forever among the Italian clans.
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>Yet Ennius too in everlasting verse
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>Proclaims those vaults of Acheron to be,
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>Though thence, he said, nor souls nor bodies fare,
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>But only phantom figures, strangely wan,
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>And tells how once from out those regions rose
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>Old Homer's ghost to him and shed salt tears
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>And with his words unfolded Nature's source.
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>Then be it ours with steady mind to clasp
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>The purport of the skies- the law behind
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>The wandering courses of the sun and moon;
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>To scan the powers that speed all life below;
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>But most to see with reasonable eyes
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>Of what the mind, of what the soul is made,
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>And what it is so terrible that breaks
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>On us asleep, or waking in disease,
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>Until we seem to mark and hear at hand
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>Dead men whose bones earth bosomed long ago.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="171"></A><B>Substance is Eternal</B>

<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR>This terror, then, this darkness of the mind,
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>Not sunrise with its flaring spokes of light,
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>Nor glittering arrows of morning can disperse,
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>But only Nature's aspect and her law,
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>Which, teaching us, hath this exordium:
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>Nothing from nothing ever yet was born.
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>Fear holds dominion over mortality
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>Only because, seeing in land and sky
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>So much the cause whereof no wise they know,
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>Men think Divinities are working there.
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>Meantime, when once we know from nothing still
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>Nothing can be create, we shall divine
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>More clearly what we seek: those elements
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>From which alone all things created are,
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>And how accomplished by no tool of Gods.
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>Suppose all sprang from all things: any kind
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>Might take its origin from any thing,
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>No fixed seed required. Men from the sea
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>Might rise, and from the land the scaly breed,
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>And, fowl full fledged come bursting from the sky;
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>The horned cattle, the herds and all the wild
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>Would haunt with varying offspring tilth and waste;
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>Nor would the same fruits keep their olden trees,
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>But each might grow from any stock or limb
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>By chance and change. Indeed, and were there not
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>For each its procreant atoms, could things have
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>Each its unalterable mother old?
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>But, since produced from fixed seeds are all,
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>Each birth goes forth upon the shores of light
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>From its own stuff, from its own primal bodies.
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>And all from all cannot become, because
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>In each resides a secret power its own.
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>Again, why see we lavished o'er the lands
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>At spring the rose, at summer heat the corn,
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>The vines that mellow when the autumn lures,
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>If not because the fixed seeds of things
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>At their own season must together stream,
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>And new creations only be revealed
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>When the due times arrive and pregnant earth
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>Safely may give unto the shores of light
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>Her tender progenies? But if from naught
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>Were their becoming, they would spring abroad
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>Suddenly, unforeseen, in alien months,
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>With no primordial germs, to be preserved
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>From procreant unions at an adverse hour.
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>Nor on the mingling of the living seeds
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>Would space be needed for the growth of things
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>Were life an increment of nothing: then
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>The tiny babe forthwith would walk a man,
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>And from the turf would leap a branching tree-
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>Wonders unheard of; for, by Nature, each
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>Slowly increases from its lawful seed,
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>And through that increase shall conserve its kind.
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>Whence take the proof that things enlarge and feed
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>From out their proper matter. Thus it comes
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>That earth, without her seasons of fixed rains,
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>Could bear no produce such as makes us glad,
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>And whatsoever lives, if shut from food,
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>Prolongs its kind and guards its life no more.
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>Thus easier 'tis to hold that many things
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>Have primal bodies in common (as we see
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>The single letters common to many words)
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>Than aught exists without its origins.
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>Moreover, why should Nature not prepare
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>Men of a bulk to ford the seas afoot,
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>Or rend the mighty mountains with their hands,
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>Or conquer Time with length of days, if not
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>Because for all begotten things abides
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>The changeless stuff, and what from that may spring
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>Is fixed forevermore? Lastly we see
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>How far the tilled surpass the fields untilled
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>And to the labour of our hands return
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>Their more abounding crops; there are indeed
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>Within the earth primordial germs of things,
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>Which, as the ploughshare turns the fruitful clods
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>And kneads the mould, we quicken into birth.
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>Else would ye mark, without all toil of ours,
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>Spontaneous generations, fairer forms.
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>Confess then, naught from nothing can become,
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>Since all must have their seeds, wherefrom to grow,
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>Wherefrom to reach the gentle fields of air.
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>Hence too it comes that Nature all dissolves
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>Into their primal bodies again, and naught
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>Perishes ever to annihilation.
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>For, were aught mortal in its every part,
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>Before our eyes it might be snatched away
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>Unto destruction; since no force were needed
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>To sunder its members and undo its bands.
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>Whereas, of truth, because all things exist,
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>With seed imperishable, Nature allows
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>Destruction nor collapse of aught, until
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>Some outward force may shatter by a blow,
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>Or inward craft, entering its hollow cells,
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>Dissolve it down. And more than this, if Time,
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>That wastes with eld the works along the world,
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>Destroy entire, consuming matter all,
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>Whence then may Venus back to light of life
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>Restore the generations kind by kind?
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>Or how, when thus restored, may daedal Earth
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>Foster and plenish with her ancient food,
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>Which, kind by kind, she offers unto each?
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>Whence may the water-springs, beneath the sea,
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>Or inland rivers, far and wide away,
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>Keep the unfathomable ocean full?
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>And out of what does Ether feed the stars?
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>For lapsed years and infinite age must else
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>Have eat all shapes of mortal stock away:
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>But be it the Long Ago contained those germs,
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>By which this sum of things recruited lives,
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>Those same infallibly can never die,
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>Nor nothing to nothing evermore return.
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>And, too, the selfsame power might end alike
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>All things, were they not still together held
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>By matter eternal, shackled through its parts,
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>Now more, now less. A touch might be enough
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>To cause destruction. For the slightest force
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>Would loose the weft of things wherein no part
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>Were of imperishable stock. But now
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>Because the fastenings of primordial parts
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>Are put together diversely and stuff
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>Is everlasting, things abide the same
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>Unhurt and sure, until some power comes on
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>Strong to destroy the warp and woof of each:
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>Nothing returns to naught; but all return
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>At their collapse to primal forms of stuff.
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>Lo, the rains perish which Ether-father throws
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>Down to the bosom of Earth-mother; but then
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>Upsprings the shining grain, and boughs are green
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>Amid the trees, and trees themselves wax big
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>And lade themselves with fruits; and hence in turn
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>The race of man and all the wild are fed;
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>Hence joyful cities thrive with boys and girls;
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>And leafy woodlands echo with new birds;
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>Hence cattle, fat and drowsy, lay their bulk
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>Along the joyous pastures whilst the drops
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>Of white ooze trickle from distended bags;
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>Hence the young scamper on their weakling joints
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>Along the tender herbs, fresh hearts afrisk
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>With warm new milk. Thus naught of what so seems
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>Perishes utterly, since Nature ever
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>Upbuilds one thing from other, suffering naught
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>To come to birth but through some other's death.
<A NAME="314"></A><BR><BR>And now, since I have taught that things cannot
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>Be born from nothing, nor the same, when born,
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>To nothing be recalled, doubt not my words,
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>Because our eyes no primal germs perceive;
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>For mark those bodies which, though known to be
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>In this our world, are yet invisible:
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>The winds infuriate lash our face and frame,
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>Unseen, and swamp huge ships and rend the clouds,
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>Or, eddying wildly down, bestrew the plains
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>With mighty trees, or scour the mountain tops
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>With forest-crackling blasts. Thus on they rave
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>With uproar shrill and ominous moan. The winds,
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>'Tis clear, are sightless bodies sweeping through
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>The sea, the lands, the clouds along the sky,
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>Vexing and whirling and seizing all amain;
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>And forth they flow and pile destruction round,
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>Even as the water's soft and supple bulk
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>Becoming a river of abounding floods,
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>Which a wide downpour from the lofty hills
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>Swells with big showers, dashes headlong down
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>Fragments of woodland and whole branching trees;
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>Nor can the solid bridges bide the shock
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>As on the waters whelm: the turbulent stream,
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>Strong with a hundred rains, beats round the piers,
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>Crashes with havoc, and rolls beneath its waves
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>Down-toppled masonry and ponderous stone,
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>Hurling away whatever would oppose.
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>Even so must move the blasts of all the winds,
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>Which, when they spread, like to a mighty flood,
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>Hither or thither, drive things on before
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>And hurl to ground with still renewed assault,
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>Or sometimes in their circling vortex seize
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>And bear in cones of whirlwind down the world:
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>The winds are sightless bodies and naught else-
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>Since both in works and ways they rival well
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>The mighty rivers, the visible in form.
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>Then too we know the varied smells of things
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>Yet never to our nostrils see them come;
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>With eyes we view not burning heats, nor cold,
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>Nor are we wont men's voices to behold.
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>Yet these must be corporeal at the base,
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>Since thus they smite the senses: naught there is
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>Save body, having property of touch.
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>And raiment, hung by surf-beat shore, grows moist,
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>The same, spread out before the sun, will dry;
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>Yet no one saw how sank the moisture in,
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>Nor how by heat off-driven. Thus we know,
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>That moisture is dispersed about in bits
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>Too small for eyes to see. Another case:
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>A ring upon the finger thins away
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>Along the under side, with years and suns;
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>The drippings from the eaves will scoop the stone;
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>The hooked ploughshare, though of iron, wastes
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>Amid the fields insidiously. We view
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>The rock-paved highways worn by many feet;
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>And at the gates the brazen statues show
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>Their right hands leaner from the frequent touch
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>Of wayfarers innumerable who greet.
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>We see how wearing-down hath minished these,
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>But just what motes depart at any time,
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>The envious nature of vision bars our sight.
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>Lastly whatever days and nature add
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>Little by little, constraining things to grow
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>In due proportion, no gaze however keen
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>Of these our eyes hath watched and known. No more
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>Can we observe what's lost at any time,
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>When things wax old with eld and foul decay,
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>Or when salt seas eat under beetling crags.
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>Thus Nature ever by unseen bodies works.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="383"></A><B>The Void</B>

<A NAME="384"></A><BR><BR>But yet creation's neither crammed nor blocked
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>About by body: there's in things a void-
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>Which to have known will serve thee many a turn,
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>Nor will not leave thee wandering in doubt,
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>Forever searching in the sum of all,
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>And losing faith in these pronouncements mine.
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>There's place intangible, a void and room.
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>For were it not, things could in nowise move;
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>Since body's property to block and check
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>Would work on all and at an times the same.
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>Thus naught could evermore push forth and go,
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>Since naught elsewhere would yield a starting place.
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>But now through oceans, lands, and heights of heaven
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>By divers causes and in divers modes,
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>Before our eyes we mark how much may move,
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>Which, finding not a void, would fail deprived
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>Of stir and motion; nay, would then have been
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>Nowise begot at all, since matter, then,
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>Had staid at rest, its parts together crammed.
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>Then too, however solid objects seem,
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>They yet are formed of matter mixed with void:
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>In rocks and caves the watery moisture seeps,
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>And beady drops stand out like plenteous tears;
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>And food finds way through every frame that lives;
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>The trees increase and yield the season's fruit
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>Because their food throughout the whole is poured,
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>Even from the deepest roots, through trunks and 
<A NAME="411"></A>boughs;
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>And voices pass the solid walls and fly
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>Reverberant through shut doorways of a house;
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>And stiffening frost seeps inward to our bones.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>Which but for voids for bodies to go through
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>'Tis clear could happen in nowise at all.
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>Again, why see we among objects some
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>Of heavier weight, but of no bulkier size:
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>Indeed, if in a ball of wool there be
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>As much of body as in lump of lead,
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>The two should weigh alike, since body tends
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>To load things downward, while the void abides,
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>By contrary nature, the imponderable.
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>Therefore, an object just as large but lighter
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>Declares infallibly its more of void;
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>Even as the heavier more of matter shows,
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>And how much less of vacant room inside.
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>That which we're seeking with sagacious quest
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>Exists, infallibly, commixed with things-
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>The void, the invisible inane.
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>Right here
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>I am compelled a question to expound,
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>Forestalling something certain folk suppose,
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>Lest it avail to lead thee off from truth:
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>Waters (they say) before the shining breed
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>Of the swift scaly creatures somehow give,
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>And straightway open sudden liquid paths,
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>Because the fishes leave behind them room
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>To which at once the yielding billows stream.
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>Thus things among themselves can yet be moved,
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>And change their place, however full the Sum-
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>Received opinion, wholly false forsooth.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>For where can scaly creatures forward dart,
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>Save where the waters give them room? Again,
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>Where can the billows yield a way, so long
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>As ever the fish are powerless to go?
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>Thus either all bodies of motion are deprived,
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>Or things contain admixture of a void
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>Where each thing gets its start in moving on.
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>Lastly, where after impact two broad bodies
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>Suddenly spring apart, the air must crowd
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>The whole new void between those bodies formed;
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>But air, however it stream with hastening gusts,
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>Can yet not fill the gap at once- for first
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>It makes for one place, ere diffused through all.
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>And then, if haply any think this comes,
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>When bodies spring apart, because the air
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>Somehow condenses, wander they from truth:
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>For then a void is formed, where none before;
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>And, too, a void is filled which was before.
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>Nor can air be condensed in such a wise;
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>Nor, granting it could, without a void, I hold,
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>It still could not contract upon itself
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>And draw its parts together into one.
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>Wherefore, despite demur and counter-speech,
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>Confess thou must there is a void in things.
<A NAME="467"></A><BR><BR>And still I might by many an argument
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>Here scrape together credence for my words.
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>But for the keen eye these mere footprints serve,
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>Whereby thou mayest know the rest thyself.
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>As dogs full oft with noses on the ground,
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>Find out the silent lairs, though hid in brush,
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>Of beasts, the mountain-rangers, when but once
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>They scent the certain footsteps of the way,
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>Thus thou thyself in themes like these alone
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>Can hunt from thought to thought, and keenly wind
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>Along even onward to the secret places
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>And drag out truth. But, if thou loiter loth
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>Or veer, however little, from the point,
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>This I can promise, Memmius, for a fact:
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>Such copious drafts my singing tongue shall pour
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>From the large well-springs of my plenished breast
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>That much I dread slow age will steal and coil
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>Along our members, and unloose the gates
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>Of life within us, ere for thee my verse
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>Hath put within thine ears the stores of proofs
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>At hand for one soever question broached.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="488"></A><B>Nothing Exists Per Se Except Atoms and the Void</B>

<A NAME="489"></A><BR><BR>But, now again to weave the tale begun,
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>All nature, then, as self-sustained, consists
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>Of twain of things: of bodies and of void
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>In which they're set, and where they're moved around.
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>For common instinct of our race declares
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>That body of itself exists: unless
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>This primal faith, deep-founded, fail us not,
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>Naught will there be whereunto to appeal
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>On things occult when seeking aught to prove
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>By reasonings of mind. Again, without
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>That place and room, which we do call the inane,
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>Nowhere could bodies then be set, nor go
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>Hither or thither at all- as shown before.
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>Besides, there's naught of which thou canst declare
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>It lives disjoined from body, shut from void-
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>A kind of third in nature. For whatever
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>Exists must be a somewhat; and the same,
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>If tangible, however fight and slight,
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>Will yet increase the count of body's sum,
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>With its own augmentation big or small;
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>But, if intangible and powerless ever
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>To keep a thing from passing through itself
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>On any side, 'twill be naught else but that
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>Which we do call the empty, the inane.
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>Again, whate'er exists, as of itself,
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>Must either act or suffer action on it.
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>Or else be that wherein things move and be:
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>Naught, saving body, acts, is acted on;
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>Naught but the inane can furnish room. And thus,
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>Beside the inane and bodies, is no third
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>Nature amid the number of all things-
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>Remainder none to fall at any time
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>Under our senses, nor be seized and seen
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>By any man through reasonings of mind.
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>Name o'er creation with what names thou wilt,
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>Thou'lt find but properties of those first twain,
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>Or see but accidents those twain produce.
<A NAME="526"></A><BR><BR>A property is that which not at all
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>Can be disjoined and severed from a thing
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>Without a fatal dissolution: such,
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>Weight to the rocks, heat to the fire, and flow
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>To the wide waters, touch to corporal things,
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>Intangibility to the viewless void.
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>But state of slavery, pauperhood, and wealth,
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>Freedom, and war, and concord, and all else
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>Which come and go whilst Nature stands the same,
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>We're wont, and rightly, to call accidents.
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>Even time exists not of itself; but sense
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>Reads out of things what happened long ago,
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>What presses now, and what shall follow after:
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>No man, we must admit, feels time itself,
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>Disjoined from motion and repose of things.
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>Thus, when they say there "is" the ravishment
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>Of Princess Helen, "is" the siege and sack
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>Of Trojan Town, look out, they force us not
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>To admit these acts existent by themselves,
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>Merely because those races of mankind
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>(Of whom these acts were accidents) long since
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>Irrevocable age has borne away:
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>For all past actions may be said to be
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>But accidents, in one way, of mankind,-
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>In other, of some region of the world.
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>Add, too, had been no matter, and no room
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>Wherein all things go on, the fire of love
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>Upblown by that fair form, the glowing coal
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>Under the Phrygian Alexander's breast,
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>Had ne'er enkindled that renowned strife
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>Of savage war, nor had the wooden horse
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>Involved in flames old Pergama, by a birth
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>At midnight of a brood of the Hellenes.
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>And thus thou canst remark that every act
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>At bottom exists not of itself, nor is
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>As body is, nor has like name with void;
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>But rather of sort more fitly to be called
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>An accident of body, and of place
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>Wherein all things go on.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="565"></A><B>Character of the Atoms</B>

<A NAME="566"></A><BR><BR>Bodies, again,
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>Are partly primal germs of things, and partly
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>Unions deriving from the primal germs.
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>And those which are the primal germs of things
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>No power can quench; for in the end they conquer
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>By their own solidness; though hard it be
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>To think that aught in things has solid frame;
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>For lightnings pass, no less than voice and shout,
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>Through hedging walls of houses, and the iron
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>White-dazzles in the fire, and rocks will burn
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>With exhalations fierce and burst asunder.
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>Totters the rigid gold dissolved in heat;
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>The ice of bronze melts conquered in the flame;
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>Warmth and the piercing cold through silver seep,
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>Since, with the cups held rightly in the hand,
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>We oft feel both, as from above is poured
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>The dew of waters between their shining sides:
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>So true it is no solid form is found.
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>But yet because true reason and nature of things
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>Constrain us, come, whilst in few verses now
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>I disentangle how there still exist
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>Bodies of solid, everlasting frame-
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>The seeds of things, the primal germs we teach,
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>Whence all creation around us came to be.
<A NAME="590"></A><BR>First since we know a twofold nature exists,
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>Of things, both twain and utterly unlike-
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>Body, and place in which an things go on-
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>Then each must be both for and through itself,
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>And all unmixed: where'er be empty space,
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>There body's not; and so where body bides,
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>There not at an exists the void inane.
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>Thus primal bodies are solid, without a void.
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>But since there's void in all begotten things,
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>All solid matter must be round the same;
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>Nor, by true reason canst thou prove aught hides
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>And holds a void within its body, unless
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>Thou grant what holds it be a solid. Know,
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>That which can hold a void of things within
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>Can be naught else than matter in union knit.
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>Thus matter, consisting of a solid frame,
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>Hath power to be eternal, though all else,
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>Though all creation, be dissolved away.
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>Again, were naught of empty and inane,
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>The world were then a solid; as, without
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>Some certain bodies to fill the places held,
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>The world that is were but a vacant void.
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>And so, infallibly, alternate-wise
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>Body and void are still distinguished,
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>Since nature knows no wholly full nor void.
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>There are, then, certain bodies, possessed of power
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>To vary forever the empty and the full;
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>And these can nor be sundered from without
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>By beats and blows, nor from within be torn
<A NAME="619"></A><BR>By penetration, nor be overthrown
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>By any assault soever through the world-
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>For without void, naught can be crushed, it seems,
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>Nor broken, nor severed by a cut in twain,
<A NAME="623"></A><BR>Nor can it take the damp, or seeping cold
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>Or piercing fire, those old destroyers three;
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>But the more void within a thing, the more
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>Entirely it totters at their sure assault.
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>Thus if first bodies be, as I have taught,
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>Solid, without a void, they must be then
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>Eternal; and, if matter ne'er had been
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>Eternal, long ere now had all things gone
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>Back into nothing utterly, and all
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>We see around from nothing had been born-
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>But since I taught above that naught can be
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>From naught created, nor the once begotten
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>To naught be summoned back, these primal germs
<A NAME="636"></A><BR>Must have an immortality of frame.
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>And into these must each thing be resolved,
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>When comes its supreme hour, that thus there be
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>At hand the stuff for plenishing the world.
<A NAME="640"></A><BR><BR>So primal germs have solid singleness
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>Nor otherwise could they have been conserved
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>Through aeons and infinity of time
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>For the replenishment of wasted worlds.
<A NAME="644"></A><BR><BR>Once more, if Nature had given a scope for things
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>To be forever broken more and more,
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>By now the bodies of matter would have been
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>So far reduced by breakings in old days
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>That from them nothing could, at season fixed,
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>Be born, and arrive its prime and of life.
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>For, lo, each thing is quicker marred than made;
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>And so what'er the long infinitude
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>Of days and all fore-passed time would now
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>By this have broken and ruined and dissolved,
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>That same could ne'er in all remaining time
<A NAME="655"></A><BR>Be builded up for plenishing the world.
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>But mark: infallibly a fixed bound
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>Remaineth stablished 'gainst their breaking down;
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>Since we behold each thing soever renewed,
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>And unto all, their seasons, after their kind,
<A NAME="660"></A><BR>Wherein they arrive the flower of their age.
<A NAME="661"></A><BR><BR>Again, if bounds have not been set against
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>The breaking down of this corporeal world,
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>Yet must all bodies of whatever things
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>Have still endured from everlasting time
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>Unto this present, as not yet assailed
<A NAME="666"></A><BR>By shocks of peril. But because the same
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>Are, to thy thinking, of a nature frail,
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>It ill accords that thus they could remain
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>(As thus they do) through everlasting time,
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>Vexed through the ages (as indeed they are)
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>By the innumerable blows of chance.
<A NAME="672"></A><BR><BR>So in our programme of creation, mark
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>How 'tis that, though the bodies of all stuff
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>The ways whereby some things are fashioned soft-
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>Air, water, earth, and fiery exhalations-
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>And by what force they function and go on:
<A NAME="677"></A><BR>The fact is founded in the void of things.
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>But if the primal germs themselves be soft,
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>Reason cannot be brought to bear to show
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>The ways whereby may be created these
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>Great crags of basalt and the during iron;
<A NAME="682"></A><BR>For their whole nature will profoundly lack
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>The first foundations of a solid frame.
<A NAME="684"></A><BR>But powerful in old simplicity,
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>Abide the solid, the primeval germs;
<A NAME="686"></A><BR>And by their combinations more condensed,
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>All objects can be tightly knit and bound
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>And made to show unconquerable strength.
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>Again, since all things kind by kind obtain
<A NAME="690"></A><BR>Fixed bounds of growing and conserving life;
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>Since Nature hath inviolably decreed
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>What each can do, what each can never do;
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>Since naught is changed, but all things so abide
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>That ever the variegated birds reveal
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>The spots or stripes peculiar to their kind,
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>Spring after spring: thus surely all that is
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>Must be composed of matter immutable.
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>For if the primal germs in any wise
<A NAME="699"></A><BR>Were open to conquest and to change, 'twould be
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>Uncertain also what could come to birth
<A NAME="701"></A><BR>And what could not, and by what law to each
<A NAME="702"></A><BR>Its scope prescribed, its boundary stone that clings
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>So deep in Time. Nor could the generations
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>Kind after kind so often reproduce
<A NAME="705"></A><BR>The nature, habits, motions, ways of life,
<A NAME="706"></A><BR>Of their progenitors.
<A NAME="707"></A><BR>And then again,
<A NAME="708"></A><BR>Since there is ever an extreme bounding point
<A NAME="709"></A><BR><BR>Of that first body which our senses now
<A NAME="710"></A><BR>Cannot perceive: That bounding point indeed
<A NAME="711"></A><BR>Exists without all parts, a minimum
<A NAME="712"></A><BR>Of nature, nor was e'er a thing apart,
<A NAME="713"></A><BR>As of itself,- nor shall hereafter be,
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>Since 'tis itself still parcel of another,
<A NAME="715"></A><BR>A first and single part, whence other parts
<A NAME="716"></A><BR>And others similar in order lie
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>In a packed phalanx, filling to the full
<A NAME="718"></A><BR>The nature of first body: being thus
<A NAME="719"></A><BR>Not self-existent, they must cleave to that
<A NAME="720"></A><BR>From which in nowise they can sundered be.
<A NAME="721"></A><BR>So primal germs have solid singleness,
<A NAME="722"></A><BR>Which tightly packed and closely joined cohere
<A NAME="723"></A><BR>By virtue of their minim particles-
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>No compound by mere union of the same;
<A NAME="725"></A><BR>But strong in their eternal singleness,
<A NAME="726"></A><BR>Nature, reserving them as seeds for things,
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>Permitteth naught of rupture or decrease.
<A NAME="728"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, were there not a minimum,
<A NAME="729"></A><BR>The smallest bodies would have infinites,
<A NAME="730"></A><BR>Since then a half-of-half could still be halved,
<A NAME="731"></A><BR>With limitless division less and less.
<A NAME="732"></A><BR>Then what the difference 'twixt the sum and least?
<A NAME="733"></A><BR>None: for however infinite the sum,
<A NAME="734"></A><BR>Yet even the smallest would consist the same
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>Of infinite parts. But since true reason here
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>Protests, denying that the mind can think it,
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>Convinced thou must confess such things there are
<A NAME="738"></A><BR>As have no parts, the minimums of nature.
<A NAME="739"></A><BR>And since these are, likewise confess thou must
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>That primal bodies are solid and eterne.
<A NAME="741"></A><BR>Again, if Nature, creatress of all things,
<A NAME="742"></A><BR>Were wont to force all things to be resolved
<A NAME="743"></A><BR>Unto least parts, then would she not avail
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>To reproduce from out them anything;
<A NAME="745"></A><BR>Because whate'er is not endowed with parts
<A NAME="746"></A><BR>Cannot possess those properties required
<A NAME="747"></A><BR>Of generative stuff- divers connections,
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>Weights, blows, encounters, motions, whereby things
<A NAME="749"></A><BR>Forevermore have being and go on.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="750"></A><B>Confutation of Other Philosophers</B>

<A NAME="751"></A><BR><BR>And on such grounds it is that those who held
<A NAME="752"></A><BR>The stuff of things is fire, and out of fire
<A NAME="753"></A><BR>Alone the cosmic sum is formed, are seen
<A NAME="754"></A><BR>Mightily from true reason to have lapsed.
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>Of whom, chief leader to do battle, comes
<A NAME="756"></A><BR>That Heraclitus, famous for dark speech
<A NAME="757"></A><BR>Among the silly, not the serious Greeks
<A NAME="758"></A><BR>Who search for truth. For dolts are ever prone
<A NAME="759"></A><BR>That to bewonder and adore which hides
<A NAME="760"></A><BR>Beneath distorted words, holding that true
<A NAME="761"></A><BR>Which sweetly tickles in their stupid ears,
<A NAME="762"></A><BR>Or which is rouged in finely finished phrase.
<A NAME="763"></A><BR>For how, I ask, can things so varied be,
<A NAME="764"></A><BR>If formed of fire, single and pure? No whit
<A NAME="765"></A><BR>'Twould help for fire to be condensed or thinned,
<A NAME="766"></A><BR>If all the parts of fire did still preserve
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>But fire's own nature, seen before in gross.
<A NAME="768"></A><BR>The heat were keener with the parts compressed,
<A NAME="769"></A><BR>Milder, again when severed or dispersed-
<A NAME="770"></A><BR>And more than this thou canst conceive of naught
<A NAME="771"></A><BR>That from such causes could become; much less
<A NAME="772"></A><BR>Might earth's variety of things be born
<A NAME="773"></A><BR>From any fires soever, dense or rare.
<A NAME="774"></A><BR>This too: if they suppose a void in things,
<A NAME="775"></A><BR>Then fires can be condensed and still left rare;
<A NAME="776"></A><BR>But since they see such opposites of thought
<A NAME="777"></A><BR>Rising against them, and are loath to leave
<A NAME="778"></A><BR>An unmixed void in things, they fear the steep
<A NAME="779"></A><BR>And lose the road of truth. Nor do they see,
<A NAME="780"></A><BR>That, if from things we take away the void,
<A NAME="781"></A><BR>All things are then condensed, and out of all
<A NAME="782"></A><BR>One body made, which has no power to dart
<A NAME="783"></A><BR>Swiftly from out itself not anything-
<A NAME="784"></A><BR>As throws the fire its light and warmth around,
<A NAME="785"></A><BR>Giving thee proof its parts are not compact.
<A NAME="786"></A><BR>But if perhaps they think, in other wise,
<A NAME="787"></A><BR>Fires through their combinations can be quenched
<A NAME="788"></A><BR>And change their substance, very well: behold,
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>If fire shall spare to do so in no part,
<A NAME="790"></A><BR>Then heat will perish utterly and all,
<A NAME="791"></A><BR>And out of nothing would the world be formed.
<A NAME="792"></A><BR>For change in anything from out its bounds
<A NAME="793"></A><BR>Means instant death of that which was before;
<A NAME="794"></A><BR>And thus a somewhat must persist unharmed
<A NAME="795"></A><BR>Amid the world, lest all return to naught,
<A NAME="796"></A><BR>And, born from naught, abundance thrive anew.
<A NAME="797"></A><BR>Now since indeed there are those surest bodies
<A NAME="798"></A><BR>Which keep their nature evermore the same,
<A NAME="799"></A><BR>Upon whose going out and coming in
<A NAME="800"></A><BR>And changed order things their nature change,
<A NAME="801"></A><BR>And all corporeal substances transformed,
<A NAME="802"></A><BR>'Tis thine to know those primal bodies, then,
<A NAME="803"></A><BR>Are not of fire. For 'twere of no avail
<A NAME="804"></A><BR>Should some depart and go away, and some
<A NAME="805"></A><BR>Be added new, and some be changed in order,
<A NAME="806"></A><BR>If still all kept their nature of old heat:
<A NAME="807"></A><BR>For whatsoever they created then
<A NAME="808"></A><BR>Would still in any case be only fire.
<A NAME="809"></A><BR>The truth, I fancy, this: bodies there are
<A NAME="810"></A><BR>Whose clashings, motions, order, posture, shapes
<A NAME="811"></A><BR>Produce the fire and which, by order changed,
<A NAME="812"></A><BR>Do change the nature of the thing produced,
<A NAME="813"></A><BR>And are thereafter nothing like to fire
<A NAME="814"></A><BR>Nor whatso else has power to send its bodies
<A NAME="815"></A><BR>With impact touching on the senses' touch.
<A NAME="816"></A><BR><BR>Again, to say that all things are but fire
<A NAME="817"></A><BR>And no true thing in number of all things
<A NAME="818"></A><BR>Exists but fire, as this same fellow says,
<A NAME="819"></A><BR>Seems crazed folly. For the man himself
<A NAME="820"></A><BR>Against the senses by the senses fights,
<A NAME="821"></A><BR>And hews at that through which is all belief,
<A NAME="822"></A><BR>Through which indeed unto himself is known
<A NAME="823"></A><BR>The thing he calls the fire. For, though he thinks
<A NAME="824"></A><BR>The senses truly can perceive the fire,
<A NAME="825"></A><BR>He thinks they cannot as regards all else,
<A NAME="826"></A><BR>Which still are palpably as clear to sense-
<A NAME="827"></A><BR>To me a thought inept and crazy too.
<A NAME="828"></A><BR>For whither shall we make appeal? for what
<A NAME="829"></A><BR>More certain than our senses can there be
<A NAME="830"></A><BR>Whereby to mark asunder error and truth?
<A NAME="831"></A><BR>Besides, why rather do away with all,
<A NAME="832"></A><BR>And wish to allow heat only, then deny
<A NAME="833"></A><BR>The fire and still allow all else to be?-
<A NAME="834"></A><BR>Alike the madness either way it seems.
<A NAME="835"></A><BR>Thus whosoe'er have held the stuff of things
<A NAME="836"></A><BR>To be but fire, and out of fire the sum,
<A NAME="837"></A><BR>And whosoever have constituted air
<A NAME="838"></A><BR>As first beginning of begotten things,
<A NAME="839"></A><BR>And all whoever have held that of itself
<A NAME="840"></A><BR>Water alone contrives things, or that earth
<A NAME="841"></A><BR>Createth all and changes things anew
<A NAME="842"></A><BR>To divers natures, mightily they seem
<A NAME="843"></A><BR>A long way to have wandered from the truth.
<A NAME="844"></A><BR><BR>Add, too, whoever make the primal stuff
<A NAME="845"></A><BR>Twofold, by joining air to fire, and earth
<A NAME="846"></A><BR>To water; add who deem that things can grow
<A NAME="847"></A><BR>Out of the four- fire, earth, and breath, and rain;
<A NAME="848"></A><BR>As first Empedocles of Acragas,
<A NAME="849"></A><BR>Whom that three-cornered isle of all the lands
<A NAME="850"></A><BR>Bore on her coasts, around which flows and flows
<A NAME="851"></A><BR>In mighty bend and bay the Ionic seas,
<A NAME="852"></A><BR>Splashing the brine from off their gray-green waves.
<A NAME="853"></A><BR>Here, billowing onward through the narrow straits,
<A NAME="854"></A><BR>Swift ocean cuts her boundaries from the shores
<A NAME="855"></A><BR>Of the Italic mainland. Here the waste
<A NAME="856"></A><BR>Charybdis; and here Aetna rumbles threats
<A NAME="857"></A><BR>To gather anew such furies of its flames
<A NAME="858"></A><BR>As with its force anew to vomit fires,
<A NAME="859"></A><BR>Belched from its throat, and skyward bear anew
<A NAME="860"></A><BR>Its lightnings' flash. And though for much she seem
<A NAME="861"></A><BR>The mighty and the wondrous isle to men,
<A NAME="862"></A><BR>Most rich in all good things, and fortified
<A NAME="863"></A><BR>With generous strength of heroes, she hath ne'er
<A NAME="864"></A><BR>Possessed within her aught of more renown,
<A NAME="865"></A><BR>Nor aught more holy, wonderful, and dear
<A NAME="866"></A><BR>Than this true man. Nay, ever so far and pure
<A NAME="867"></A><BR>The lofty music of his breast divine
<A NAME="868"></A><BR>Lifts up its voice and tells of glories found,
<A NAME="869"></A><BR>That scarce he seems of human stock create.
<A NAME="870"></A><BR><BR>Yet he and those forementioned (known to be
<A NAME="871"></A><BR>So far beneath him, less than he in all),
<A NAME="872"></A><BR>Though, as discoverers of much goodly truth,
<A NAME="873"></A><BR>They gave, as 'twere from out of the heart's own 
<A NAME="874"></A>shrine,
<A NAME="875"></A><BR>Responses holier and soundlier based
<A NAME="876"></A><BR>Than ever the Pythia pronounced for men
<A NAME="877"></A><BR>From out the tripod and the Delphian laurel,
<A NAME="878"></A><BR>Have still in matter of first-elements
<A NAME="879"></A><BR>Made ruin of themselves, and, great men, great
<A NAME="880"></A><BR>Indeed and heavy there for them the fall:
<A NAME="881"></A><BR>First, because, banishing the void from things,
<A NAME="882"></A><BR>They yet assign them motion, and allow
<A NAME="883"></A><BR>Things soft and loosely textured to exist,
<A NAME="884"></A><BR>As air, dew, fire, earth, animals, and grains,
<A NAME="885"></A><BR>Without admixture of void amid their frame.
<A NAME="886"></A><BR>Next, because, thinking there can be no end
<A NAME="887"></A><BR>In cutting bodies down to less and less
<A NAME="888"></A><BR>Nor pause established to their breaking up,
<A NAME="889"></A><BR>They hold there is no minimum in things;
<A NAME="890"></A><BR>Albeit we see the boundary point of aught
<A NAME="891"></A><BR>Is that which to our senses seems its least,
<A NAME="892"></A><BR>Whereby thou mayst conjecture, that, because
<A NAME="893"></A><BR>The things thou canst not mark have boundary points,
<A NAME="894"></A><BR>They surely have their minimums. Then, too,
<A NAME="895"></A><BR>Since these philosophers ascribe to things
<A NAME="896"></A><BR>Soft primal germs, which we behold to be
<A NAME="897"></A><BR>Of birth and body mortal, thus, throughout,
<A NAME="898"></A><BR>The sum of things must be returned to naught,
<A NAME="899"></A><BR>And, born from naught, abundance thrive anew-
<A NAME="900"></A><BR>Thou seest how far each doctrine stands from truth.
<A NAME="901"></A><BR>And, next, these bodies are among themselves
<A NAME="902"></A><BR>In many ways poisons and foes to each,
<A NAME="903"></A><BR>Wherefore their congress will destroy them quite
<A NAME="904"></A><BR>Or drive asunder as we see in storms
<A NAME="905"></A><BR>Rains, winds, and lightnings all asunder fly.
<A NAME="906"></A><BR>Thus too, if all things are create of four,
<A NAME="907"></A><BR>And all again dissolved into the four,
<A NAME="908"></A><BR>How can the four be called the primal germs
<A NAME="909"></A><BR>Of things, more than all things themselves be thought,
<A NAME="910"></A><BR>By retroversion, primal germs of them?
<A NAME="911"></A><BR>For ever alternately are both begot,
<A NAME="912"></A><BR>With interchange of nature and aspect
<A NAME="913"></A><BR>From immemorial time. But if percase
<A NAME="914"></A><BR>Thou think'st the frame of fire and earth, the air,
<A NAME="915"></A><BR>The dew of water can in such wise meet
<A NAME="916"></A><BR>As not by mingling to resign their nature,
<A NAME="917"></A><BR>From them for thee no world can be create-
<A NAME="918"></A><BR>No thing of breath, no stock or stalk of tree:
<A NAME="919"></A><BR>In the wild congress of this varied heap
<A NAME="920"></A><BR>Each thing its proper nature will display,
<A NAME="921"></A><BR>And air will palpably be seen mixed up
<A NAME="922"></A><BR>With earth together, unquenched heat with water.
<A NAME="923"></A><BR>But primal germs in bringing things to birth
<A NAME="924"></A><BR>Must have a latent, unseen quality,
<A NAME="925"></A><BR>Lest some outstanding alien element
<A NAME="926"></A><BR>Confuse and minish in the thing create
<A NAME="927"></A><BR>Its proper being.
<A NAME="928"></A><BR>But these men begin
<A NAME="929"></A><BR>From heaven, and from its fires; and first they 
<A NAME="930"></A>feign
<A NAME="931"></A><BR>That fire will turn into the winds of air,
<A NAME="932"></A><BR>Next, that from air the rain begotten is,
<A NAME="933"></A><BR>And earth created out of rain, and then
<A NAME="934"></A><BR>That all, reversely, are returned from earth-
<A NAME="935"></A><BR>The moisture first, then air thereafter heat-
<A NAME="936"></A><BR>And that these same ne'er cease in interchange,
<A NAME="937"></A><BR>To go their ways from heaven to earth, from earth
<A NAME="938"></A><BR>Unto the stars of the ethereal world-
<A NAME="939"></A><BR>Which in no wise at all the germs can do.
<A NAME="940"></A><BR>Since an immutable somewhat still must be,
<A NAME="941"></A><BR>Lest all things utterly be sped to naught;
<A NAME="942"></A><BR>For change in anything from out its bounds
<A NAME="943"></A><BR>Means instant death of that which was before.
<A NAME="944"></A><BR>Wherefore, since those things, mentioned heretofore,
<A NAME="945"></A><BR>Suffer a changed state, they must derive
<A NAME="946"></A><BR>From others ever unconvertible,
<A NAME="947"></A><BR>Lest an things utterly return to naught.
<A NAME="948"></A><BR>Then why not rather presuppose there be
<A NAME="949"></A><BR>Bodies with such a nature furnished forth
<A NAME="950"></A><BR>That, if perchance they have created fire,
<A NAME="951"></A><BR>Can still (by virtue of a few withdrawn,
<A NAME="952"></A><BR>Or added few, and motion and order changed)
<A NAME="953"></A><BR>Fashion the winds of air, and thus all things
<A NAME="954"></A><BR>Forevermore be interchanged with all?
<A NAME="955"></A><BR>"But facts in proof are manifest;" thou sayest,
<A NAME="956"></A><BR>"That all things grow into the winds of air
<A NAME="957"></A><BR>And forth from earth are nourished, and unless
<A NAME="958"></A><BR>The season favour at propitious hour
<A NAME="959"></A><BR>With rains enough to set the trees a-reel
<A NAME="960"></A><BR>Under the soak of bulking thunderheads,
<A NAME="961"></A><BR>And sun, for its share, foster and give heat,
<A NAME="962"></A><BR>No grains, nor trees, nor breathing things can grow."
<A NAME="963"></A><BR>True- and unless hard food and moisture soft
<A NAME="964"></A><BR>Recruited man, his frame would waste away,
<A NAME="965"></A><BR>And life dissolve from out his thews and bones;
<A NAME="966"></A><BR>For out of doubt recruited and fed are we
<A NAME="967"></A><BR>By certain things, as other things by others.
<A NAME="968"></A><BR>Because in many ways the many germs
<A NAME="969"></A><BR>Common to many things are mixed in things,
<A NAME="970"></A><BR>No wonder 'tis that therefore divers things
<A NAME="971"></A><BR>By divers things are nourished. And, again,
<A NAME="972"></A><BR>Often it matters vastly with what others,
<A NAME="973"></A><BR>In what positions the primordial germs
<A NAME="974"></A><BR>Are bound together, and what motions, too,
<A NAME="975"></A><BR>They give and get among themselves; for these
<A NAME="976"></A><BR>Same germs do put together sky, sea, lands,
<A NAME="977"></A><BR>Rivers, and sun, grains, trees, and breathing things,
<A NAME="978"></A><BR>But yet commixed they are in divers modes
<A NAME="979"></A><BR>With divers things, forever as they move.
<A NAME="980"></A><BR>Nay, thou beholdest in our verses here
<A NAME="981"></A><BR>Elements many, common to many worlds,
<A NAME="982"></A><BR>Albeit thou must confess each verse, each word
<A NAME="983"></A><BR>From one another differs both in sense
<A NAME="984"></A><BR>And ring of sound- so much the elements
<A NAME="985"></A><BR>Can bring about by change of order alone.
<A NAME="986"></A><BR>But those which are the primal germs of things
<A NAME="987"></A><BR>Have power to work more combinations still,
<A NAME="988"></A><BR>Whence divers things can be produced in turn.
<A NAME="989"></A><BR><BR>Now let us also take for scrutiny
<A NAME="990"></A><BR>The homeomeria of Anaxagoras,
<A NAME="991"></A><BR>So called by Greeks, for which our pauper-speech
<A NAME="992"></A><BR>Yieldeth no name in the Italian tongue,
<A NAME="993"></A><BR>Although the thing itself is not o'erhard
<A NAME="994"></A><BR>For explanation. First, then, when he speaks
<A NAME="995"></A><BR>Of this homeomeria of things, he thinks
<A NAME="996"></A><BR>Bones to be sprung from littlest bones minute,
<A NAME="997"></A><BR>And from minute and littlest flesh all flesh,
<A NAME="998"></A><BR>And blood created out of drops of blood,
<A NAME="999"></A><BR>Conceiving gold compact of grains of gold,
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR>And earth concreted out of bits of earth,
<A NAME="1001"></A><BR>Fire made of fires, and water out of waters,
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR>Feigning the like with all the rest of stuff.
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR>Yet he concedes not an void in things,
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR>Nor any limit to cutting bodies down.
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR>Wherefore to me he seems on both accounts
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR>To err no less than those we named before.
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR>Add too: these germs he feigns are far too frail-
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR>If they be germs primordial furnished forth
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR>With but same nature as the things themselves,
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR>And travail and perish equally with those,
<A NAME="1011"></A><BR>And no rein curbs therm from annihilation.
<A NAME="1012"></A><BR>For which will last against the grip and crush
<A NAME="1013"></A><BR>Under the teeth of death? the fire? the moist?
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR>Or else the air? which then? the blood? the bones?
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR>No one, methinks, when every thing will be
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR>At bottom as mortal as whate'er we mark
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR>To perish by force before our gazing eyes.
<A NAME="1018"></A><BR>But my appeal is to the proofs above
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR>That things cannot fall back to naught, nor yet
<A NAME="1020"></A><BR>From naught increase. And now again, since food
<A NAME="1021"></A><BR>Augments and nourishes the human frame,
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR>'Tis thine to know our veins and blood and bones
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR>And thews are formed of particles unlike
<A NAME="1024"></A><BR>To them in kind; or if they say all foods
<A NAME="1025"></A><BR>Are of mixed substance having in themselves
<A NAME="1026"></A><BR>Small bodies of thews, and bones, and also veins
<A NAME="1027"></A><BR>And particles of blood, then every food,
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR>Solid or liquid, must itself be thought
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR>As made and mixed of things unlike in kind-
<A NAME="1030"></A><BR>Of bones, of thews, of ichor and of blood.
<A NAME="1031"></A><BR>Again, if all the bodies which upgrow
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR>From earth, are first within the earth, then earth
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR>Must be compound of alien substances earth.
<A NAME="1034"></A><BR>Which spring and bloom abroad from out the earth.
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR>Transfer the argument, and thou may'st use
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR>The selfsame words: if flame and smoke and ash
<A NAME="1037"></A><BR>Still lurk unseen within the wood, the wood
<A NAME="1038"></A><BR>Must be compound of alien substances
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR>Which spring from out the wood.
<A NAME="1040"></A><BR>Right here remains
<A NAME="1041"></A><BR>A certain slender means to skulk from truth,
<A NAME="1042"></A><BR>Which Anaxagoras takes unto himself,
<A NAME="1043"></A><BR>Who holds that all things lurk commixed with all
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR>While that one only comes to view, of which
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR>The bodies exceed in number all the rest,
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR>And lie more close to hand and at the fore-
<A NAME="1047"></A><BR>A notion banished from true reason far.
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR>For then 'twere meet that kernels of the grains
<A NAME="1049"></A><BR>Should oft, when crunched between the might of stones,
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR>Give forth a sign of blood, or of aught else
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR>Which in our human frame is fed; and that
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR>Rock rubbed on rock should yield a gory ooze.
<A NAME="1053"></A><BR>Likewise the herbs ought oft to give forth drops
<A NAME="1054"></A><BR>Of sweet milk, flavoured like the uddered sheep's;
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR>Indeed we ought to find, when crumbling up
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR>The earthy clods, there herbs, and grains, and leaves,
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR>All sorts dispersed minutely in the soil;
<A NAME="1058"></A><BR>Lastly we ought to find in cloven wood
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR>Ashes and smoke and bits of fire there hid.
<A NAME="1060"></A><BR>But since fact teaches this is not the case,
<A NAME="1061"></A><BR>'Tis thine to know things are not mixed with things
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR>Thuswise; but seeds, common to many things,
<A NAME="1063"></A><BR>Commixed in many ways, must lurk in things.
<A NAME="1064"></A><BR>"But often it happens on skiey hills" thou sayest,
<A NAME="1065"></A><BR>"That neighbouring tops of lofty trees are rubbed
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR>One against other, smote by the blustering south,
<A NAME="1067"></A><BR>Till all ablaze with bursting flower of flame."
<A NAME="1068"></A><BR>Good sooth- yet fire is not ingraft in wood,
<A NAME="1069"></A><BR>But many are the seeds of heat, and when
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR>Rubbing together they together flow,
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR>They start the conflagrations in the forests.
<A NAME="1072"></A><BR>Whereas if flame, already fashioned, lay
<A NAME="1073"></A><BR>Stored up within the forests, then the fires
<A NAME="1074"></A><BR>Could not for any time be kept unseen,
<A NAME="1075"></A><BR>But would be laying all the wildwood waste
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR>And burning all the boscage. Now dost see
<A NAME="1077"></A><BR>(Even as we said a little space above)
<A NAME="1078"></A><BR>How mightily it matters with what others,
<A NAME="1079"></A><BR>In what positions these same primal germs
<A NAME="1080"></A><BR>Are bound together? And what motions, too,
<A NAME="1081"></A><BR>They give and get among themselves? how, hence,
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR>The same, if altered 'mongst themselves, can body
<A NAME="1083"></A><BR>Both igneous and ligneous objects forth-
<A NAME="1084"></A><BR>Precisely as these words themselves are made
<A NAME="1085"></A><BR>By somewhat altering their elements,
<A NAME="1086"></A><BR>Although we mark with name indeed distinct
<A NAME="1087"></A><BR>The igneous from the ligneous. Once again,
<A NAME="1088"></A><BR>If thou suppose whatever thou beholdest,
<A NAME="1089"></A><BR>Among all visible objects, cannot be,
<A NAME="1090"></A><BR>Unless thou feign bodies of matter endowed
<A NAME="1091"></A><BR>With a like nature,- by thy vain device
<A NAME="1092"></A><BR>For thee will perish all the germs of things:
<A NAME="1093"></A><BR>'Twill come to pass they'll laugh aloud, like men,
<A NAME="1094"></A><BR>Shaken asunder by a spasm of mirth,
<A NAME="1095"></A><BR>Or moisten with salty tear-drops cheeks and chins.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1096"></A><B>The Infinity of the Universe</B>

<A NAME="1097"></A><BR><BR>Now learn of what remains! More keenly hear!
<A NAME="1098"></A><BR>And for myself, my mind is not deceived
<A NAME="1099"></A><BR>How dark it is: But the large hope of praise
<A NAME="1100"></A><BR>Hath strook with pointed thyrsus through my heart;
<A NAME="1101"></A><BR>On the same hour hath strook into my breast
<A NAME="1102"></A><BR>Sweet love of the Muses, wherewith now instinct,
<A NAME="1103"></A><BR>I wander afield, thriving in sturdy thought,
<A NAME="1104"></A><BR>Through unpathed haunts of the Pierides,
<A NAME="1105"></A><BR>Trodden by step of none before. I joy
<A NAME="1106"></A><BR>To come on undefiled fountains there,
<A NAME="1107"></A><BR>To drain them deep; I joy to pluck new flowers,
<A NAME="1108"></A><BR>To seek for this my head a signal crown
<A NAME="1109"></A><BR>From regions where the Muses never yet
<A NAME="1110"></A><BR>Have garlanded the temples of a man:
<A NAME="1111"></A><BR>First, since I teach concerning mighty things,
<A NAME="1112"></A><BR>And go right on to loose from round the mind
<A NAME="1113"></A><BR>The tightened coils of dread religion;
<A NAME="1114"></A><BR>Next, since, concerning themes so dark, I frame
<A NAME="1115"></A><BR>Songs so pellucid, touching all throughout
<A NAME="1116"></A><BR>Even with the Muses' charm- which, as 'twould seem,
<A NAME="1117"></A><BR>Is not without a reasonable ground:
<A NAME="1118"></A><BR>But as physicians, when they seek to give
<A NAME="1119"></A><BR>Young boys the nauseous wormwood, first do touch
<A NAME="1120"></A><BR>The brim around the cup with the sweet juice
<A NAME="1121"></A><BR>And yellow of the boney, in order that
<A NAME="1122"></A><BR>The thoughtless age of boyhood be cajoled
<A NAME="1123"></A><BR>As far as the lips, and meanwhile swallow down
<A NAME="1124"></A><BR>The wormwood's bitter draught, and, though befooled
<A NAME="1125"></A><BR>Be yet not merely duped, but rather thus
<A NAME="1126"></A><BR>Grow strong again with recreated health:
<A NAME="1127"></A><BR>So now I too (since this my doctrine seems
<A NAME="1128"></A><BR>In general somewhat woeful unto those
<A NAME="1129"></A><BR>Who've had it not in hand, and since the crowd
<A NAME="1130"></A><BR>Starts back from it in horror) have desired
<A NAME="1131"></A><BR>To expound our doctrine unto thee in song
<A NAME="1132"></A><BR>Soft-speaking and Pierian, and, as 'twere,
<A NAME="1133"></A><BR>To touch it with sweet honey of the Muse-
<A NAME="1134"></A><BR>If by such method haply I might hold
<A NAME="1135"></A><BR>The mind of thee upon these lines of ours,
<A NAME="1136"></A><BR>Till thou see through the nature of all things,
<A NAME="1137"></A><BR>And how exists the interwoven frame.
<A NAME="1138"></A><BR><BR>But since I've taught that bodies of matter, 
<A NAME="1139"></A>made
<A NAME="1140"></A><BR>Completely solid, hither and thither fly
<A NAME="1141"></A><BR>Forevermore unconquered through all time,
<A NAME="1142"></A><BR>Now come, and whether to the sum of them
<A NAME="1143"></A><BR>There be a limit or be none, for thee
<A NAME="1144"></A><BR>Let us unfold; likewise what has been found
<A NAME="1145"></A><BR>To be the wide inane, or room, or space
<A NAME="1146"></A><BR>Wherein all things soever do go on,
<A NAME="1147"></A><BR>Let us examine if it finite be
<A NAME="1148"></A><BR>All and entire, or reach unmeasured round
<A NAME="1149"></A><BR>And downward an illimitable profound.
<A NAME="1150"></A><BR><BR>Thus, then, the All that is is limited
<A NAME="1151"></A><BR>In no one region of its onward paths,
<A NAME="1152"></A><BR>For then 'tmust have forever its beyond.
<A NAME="1153"></A><BR>And a beyond 'tis seen can never be
<A NAME="1154"></A><BR>For aught, unless still further on there be
<A NAME="1155"></A><BR>A somewhat somewhere that may bound the same-
<A NAME="1156"></A><BR>So that the thing be seen still on to where
<A NAME="1157"></A><BR>The nature of sensation of that thing
<A NAME="1158"></A><BR>Can follow it no longer. Now because
<A NAME="1159"></A><BR>Confess we must there's naught beside the sum,
<A NAME="1160"></A><BR>There's no beyond, and so it lacks all end.
<A NAME="1161"></A><BR>It matters nothing where thou post thyself,
<A NAME="1162"></A><BR>In whatsoever regions of the same;
<A NAME="1163"></A><BR>Even any place a man has set him down
<A NAME="1164"></A><BR>Still leaves about him the unbounded all
<A NAME="1165"></A><BR>Outward in all directions; or, supposing
<A NAME="1166"></A><BR>moment the all of space finite to be,
<A NAME="1167"></A><BR>If some one farthest traveller runs forth
<A NAME="1168"></A><BR>Unto the extreme coasts and throws ahead
<A NAME="1169"></A><BR>A flying spear, is't then thy wish to think
<A NAME="1170"></A><BR>It goes, hurled off amain, to where 'twas sent
<A NAME="1171"></A><BR>And shoots afar, or that some object there
<A NAME="1172"></A><BR>Can thwart and stop it? For the one or other
<A NAME="1173"></A><BR>Thou must admit; and take. Either of which
<A NAME="1174"></A><BR>Shuts off escape for thee, and does compel
<A NAME="1175"></A><BR>That thou concede the all spreads everywhere,
<A NAME="1176"></A><BR>Owning no confines. Since whether there be
<A NAME="1177"></A><BR>Aught that may block and check it so it comes
<A NAME="1178"></A><BR>Not where 'twas sent, nor lodges in its goal,
<A NAME="1179"></A><BR>Or whether borne along, in either view
<A NAME="1180"></A><BR>'Thas started not from any end. And so
<A NAME="1181"></A><BR>I'll follow on, and whereso'er thou set
<A NAME="1182"></A><BR>The extreme coasts, I'll query, "what becomes
<A NAME="1183"></A><BR>Thereafter of thy spear?" 'Twill come to pass
<A NAME="1184"></A><BR>That nowhere can a world's-end be, and that
<A NAME="1185"></A><BR>The chance for further flight prolongs forever
<A NAME="1186"></A><BR>The flight itself. Besides, were all the space
<A NAME="1187"></A><BR>Of the totality and sum shut in
<A NAME="1188"></A><BR>With fixed coasts, and bounded everywhere,
<A NAME="1189"></A><BR>Then would the abundance of world's matter flow
<A NAME="1190"></A><BR>Together by solid weight from everywhere
<A NAME="1191"></A><BR>Still downward to the bottom of the world,
<A NAME="1192"></A><BR>Nor aught could happen under cope of sky,
<A NAME="1193"></A><BR>Nor could there be a sky at all or sun-
<A NAME="1194"></A><BR>Indeed, where matter all one heap would lie,
<A NAME="1195"></A><BR>By having settled during infinite time.
<A NAME="1196"></A><BR>But in reality, repose is given
<A NAME="1197"></A><BR>Unto no bodies 'mongst the elements,
<A NAME="1198"></A><BR>Because there is no bottom whereunto
<A NAME="1199"></A><BR>They might, as 'twere, together flow, and where
<A NAME="1200"></A><BR>They might take up their undisturbed abodes.
<A NAME="1201"></A><BR>In endless motion everything goes on
<A NAME="1202"></A><BR>Forevermore; out of all regions, even
<A NAME="1203"></A><BR>Out of the pit below, from forth the vast,
<A NAME="1204"></A><BR>Are hurtled bodies evermore supplied.
<A NAME="1205"></A><BR>The nature of room, the space of the abyss
<A NAME="1206"></A><BR>Is such that even the flashing thunderbolts
<A NAME="1207"></A><BR>Can neither speed upon their courses through,
<A NAME="1208"></A><BR>Gliding across eternal tracts of time,
<A NAME="1209"></A><BR>Nor, further, bring to pass, as on they run,
<A NAME="1210"></A><BR>That they may bate their journeying one whit:
<A NAME="1211"></A><BR>Such huge abundance spreads for things around-
<A NAME="1212"></A><BR>Room off to every quarter, without end.
<A NAME="1213"></A><BR>Lastly, before our very eyes is seen
<A NAME="1214"></A><BR>Thing to bound thing: air hedges hill from hill,
<A NAME="1215"></A><BR>And mountain walls hedge air; land ends the sea,
<A NAME="1216"></A><BR>And sea in turn all lands; but for the All
<A NAME="1217"></A><BR>Truly is nothing which outside may bound.
<A NAME="1218"></A><BR>That, too, the sum of things itself may not
<A NAME="1219"></A><BR>Have power to fix a measure of its own,
<A NAME="1220"></A><BR>Great Nature guards, she who compels the void
<A NAME="1221"></A><BR>To bound all body, as body all the void,
<A NAME="1222"></A><BR>Thus rendering by these alternates the whole
<A NAME="1223"></A><BR>An infinite; or else the one or other,
<A NAME="1224"></A><BR>Being unbounded by the other, spreads,
<A NAME="1225"></A><BR>Even by its single nature, ne'ertheless
<A NAME="1226"></A><BR>Immeasurably forth....
<A NAME="1227"></A><BR>Nor sea, nor earth, nor shining vaults of sky,
<A NAME="1228"></A><BR>Nor breed of mortals, nor holy limbs of gods
<A NAME="1229"></A><BR>Could keep their place least portion of an hour:
<A NAME="1230"></A><BR>For, driven apart from out its meetings fit,
<A NAME="1231"></A><BR>The stock of stuff, dissolved, would be borne
<A NAME="1232"></A><BR>Along the illimitable inane afar,
<A NAME="1233"></A><BR>Or rather, in fact, would never have once combined
<A NAME="1234"></A><BR>And given a birth to aught, since, scattered wide,
<A NAME="1235"></A><BR>It could not be united. For of truth
<A NAME="1236"></A><BR>Neither by counsel did the primal germs
<A NAME="1237"></A><BR>'Stablish themselves, as by keen act of mind,
<A NAME="1238"></A><BR>Each in its proper place; nor did they make,
<A NAME="1239"></A><BR>Forsooth, a compact how each germ should move;
<A NAME="1240"></A><BR>But since, being many and changed in many modes
<A NAME="1241"></A><BR>Along the All, they're driven abroad and vexed
<A NAME="1242"></A><BR>By blow on blow, even from all time of old,
<A NAME="1243"></A><BR>They thus at last, after attempting all
<A NAME="1244"></A><BR>The kinds of motion and conjoining, come
<A NAME="1245"></A><BR>Into those great arrangements out of which
<A NAME="1246"></A><BR>This sum of things established is create,
<A NAME="1247"></A><BR>By which, moreover, through the mighty years,
<A NAME="1248"></A><BR>It is preserved, when once it has been thrown
<A NAME="1249"></A><BR>Into the proper motions, bringing to pass
<A NAME="1250"></A><BR>That ever the streams refresh the greedy main
<A NAME="1251"></A><BR>With river-waves abounding, and that earth,
<A NAME="1252"></A><BR>Lapped in warm exhalations of the sun,
<A NAME="1253"></A><BR>Renews her broods, and that the lusty race
<A NAME="1254"></A><BR>Of breathing creatures bears and blooms, and that
<A NAME="1255"></A><BR>The gliding fires of ether are alive-
<A NAME="1256"></A><BR>What still the primal germs nowise could do,
<A NAME="1257"></A><BR>Unless from out the infinite of space
<A NAME="1258"></A><BR>Could come supply of matter, whence in season
<A NAME="1259"></A><BR>They're wont whatever losses to repair.
<A NAME="1260"></A><BR>For as the nature of breathing creatures wastes,
<A NAME="1261"></A><BR>Losing its body, when deprived of food:
<A NAME="1262"></A><BR>So all things have to be dissolved as soon
<A NAME="1263"></A><BR>As matter, diverted by what means soever
<A NAME="1264"></A><BR>From off its course, shall fail to be on hand.
<A NAME="1265"></A><BR>Nor can the blows from outward still conserve,
<A NAME="1266"></A><BR>On every side, whatever sum of a world
<A NAME="1267"></A><BR>Has been united in a whole. They can
<A NAME="1268"></A><BR>Indeed, by frequent beating, check a part,
<A NAME="1269"></A><BR>Till others arriving may fulfil the sum;
<A NAME="1270"></A><BR>But meanwhile often are they forced to spring
<A NAME="1271"></A><BR>Rebounding back, and, as they spring, to yield,
<A NAME="1272"></A><BR>Unto those elements whence a world derives,
<A NAME="1273"></A><BR>Room and a time for flight, permitting them
<A NAME="1274"></A><BR>To be from off the massy union borne
<A NAME="1275"></A><BR>Free and afar. Wherefore, again, again:
<A NAME="1276"></A><BR>Needs must there come a many for supply;
<A NAME="1277"></A><BR>And also, that the blows themselves shall be
<A NAME="1278"></A><BR>Unfailing ever, must there ever be
<A NAME="1279"></A><BR>An infinite force of matter all sides round.
<A NAME="1280"></A><BR><BR>And in these problems, shrink, my Memmius, far
<A NAME="1281"></A><BR>From yielding faith to that notorious talk:
<A NAME="1282"></A><BR>That all things inward to the centre press;
<A NAME="1283"></A><BR>And thus the nature of the world stands firm
<A NAME="1284"></A><BR>With never blows from outward, nor can be
<A NAME="1285"></A><BR>Nowhere disparted- since all height and depth
<A NAME="1286"></A><BR>Have always inward to the centre pressed
<A NAME="1287"></A><BR>(If thou art ready to believe that aught
<A NAME="1288"></A><BR>Itself can rest upon itself ); or that
<A NAME="1289"></A><BR>The ponderous bodies which be under earth
<A NAME="1290"></A><BR>Do all press upwards and do come to rest
<A NAME="1291"></A><BR>Upon the earth, in some ways upside down,
<A NAME="1292"></A><BR>Like to those images of things we see
<A NAME="1293"></A><BR>At present through the waters. They contend,
<A NAME="1294"></A><BR>With like procedure, that all breathing things
<A NAME="1295"></A><BR>Head downward roam about, and yet cannot
<A NAME="1296"></A><BR>Tumble from earth to realms of sky below,
<A NAME="1297"></A><BR>No more than these our bodies wing away
<A NAME="1298"></A><BR>Spontaneously to vaults of sky above;
<A NAME="1299"></A><BR>That, when those creatures look upon the sun,
<A NAME="1300"></A><BR>We view the constellations of the night;
<A NAME="1301"></A><BR>And that with us the seasons of the sky
<A NAME="1302"></A><BR>They thus alternately divide, and thus
<A NAME="1303"></A><BR>Do pass the night coequal to our days,
<A NAME="1304"></A><BR>But a vain error has given these dreams to fools,
<A NAME="1305"></A><BR>What they've embraced with reasoning perverse
<A NAME="1306"></A><BR>For centre none can be where world is still
<A NAME="1307"></A><BR>Boundless, nor yet, if now a centre were,
<A NAME="1308"></A><BR>Could aught take there a fixed position more
<A NAME="1309"></A><BR>Than for some other cause 'tmight be dislodged.
<A NAME="1310"></A><BR>For all of room and space we call the void
<A NAME="1311"></A><BR>Must both through centre and non-centre yield
<A NAME="1312"></A><BR>Alike to weights where'er their motions tend.
<A NAME="1313"></A><BR>Nor is there any place, where, when they've come,
<A NAME="1314"></A><BR>Bodies can be at standstill in the void,
<A NAME="1315"></A><BR>Deprived of force of weight; nor yet may void
<A NAME="1316"></A><BR>Furnish support to any,- nay, it must,
<A NAME="1317"></A><BR>True to its bent of nature, still give way.
<A NAME="1318"></A><BR>Thus in such manner not all can things
<A NAME="1319"></A><BR>Be held in union, as if overcome
<A NAME="1320"></A><BR>By craving for a centre.
<A NAME="1321"></A><BR>But besides,
<A NAME="1322"></A><BR>Seeing they feign that not all bodies press
<A NAME="1323"></A><BR>To centre inward, rather only those
<A NAME="1324"></A><BR>Of earth and water (liquid of the sea,
<A NAME="1325"></A><BR>And the big billows from the mountain slopes,
<A NAME="1326"></A><BR>And whatsoever are encased, as 'twere,
<A NAME="1327"></A><BR>In earthen body), contrariwise, they teach
<A NAME="1328"></A><BR>How the thin air, and with it the hot fire,
<A NAME="1329"></A><BR>Is borne asunder from the centre, and how,
<A NAME="1330"></A><BR>For this all ether quivers with bright stars,
<A NAME="1331"></A><BR>And the sun's flame along the blue is fed
<A NAME="1332"></A><BR>(Because the heat, from out the centre flying,
<A NAME="1333"></A><BR>All gathers there), and how, again, the boughs
<A NAME="1334"></A><BR>Upon the tree-tops could not sprout their leaves,
<A NAME="1335"></A><BR>Unless, little by little, from out the earth
<A NAME="1336"></A><BR>For each were nutriment...
<A NAME="1337"></A><BR><BR>Lest, after the manner of the winged flames,
<A NAME="1338"></A><BR>The ramparts of the world should flee away,
<A NAME="1339"></A><BR>Dissolved amain throughout the mighty void,
<A NAME="1340"></A><BR>And lest all else should likewise follow after,
<A NAME="1341"></A><BR>Aye, lest the thundering vaults of heaven should 
<A NAME="1342"></A>burst
<A NAME="1343"></A><BR>And splinter upward, and the earth forthwith
<A NAME="1344"></A><BR>Withdraw from under our feet, and all its bulk,
<A NAME="1345"></A><BR>Among its mingled wrecks and those of heaven,
<A NAME="1346"></A><BR>With slipping asunder of the primal seeds,
<A NAME="1347"></A><BR>Should pass, along the immeasurable inane,
<A NAME="1348"></A><BR>Away forever, and, that instant, naught
<A NAME="1349"></A><BR>Of wrack and remnant would be left, beside
<A NAME="1350"></A><BR>The desolate space, and germs invisible.
<A NAME="1351"></A><BR>For on whatever side thou deemest first
<A NAME="1352"></A><BR>The primal bodies lacking, lo, that side
<A NAME="1353"></A><BR>Will be for things the very door of death:
<A NAME="1354"></A><BR>Wherethrough the throng of matter all will dash,
<A NAME="1355"></A><BR>Out and abroad.
<A NAME="1356"></A><BR>These points, if thou wilt ponder,
<A NAME="1357"></A><BR>Then, with but paltry trouble led along...
<A NAME="1358"></A><BR><BR>For one thing after other will grow clear,
<A NAME="1359"></A><BR>Nor shall the blind night rob thee of the road,
<A NAME="1360"></A><BR>To hinder thy gaze on Nature's Farthest-forth.
<A NAME="1361"></A><BR>Thus things for things shall kindle torches new.
