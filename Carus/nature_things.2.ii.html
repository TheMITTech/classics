<A NAME="10"></A><B>Proem</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>'Tis sweet, when, down the mighty main, the winds
<A NAME="12"></A><BR>Roll up its waste of waters, from the land
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>To watch another's labouring anguish far,
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>Not that we joyously delight that man
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>Should thus be smitten, but because 'tis sweet
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>To mark what evils we ourselves be spared;
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>'Tis sweet, again, to view the mighty strife
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>Of armies embattled yonder o'er the plains,
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>Ourselves no sharers in the peril; but naught
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>There is more goodly than to hold the high
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>Serene plateaus, well fortressed by the wise,
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>Whence thou may'st look below on other men
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>And see them ev'rywhere wand'ring, all dispersed
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>In their lone seeking for the road of life;
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>Rivals in genius, or emulous in rank,
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>Pressing through days and nights with hugest toil
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>For summits of power and mastery of the world.
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>O wretched minds of men! O blinded hearts!
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>In how great perils, in what darks of life
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>Are spent the human years, however brief!-
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>O not to see that Nature for herself
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>Barks after nothing, save that pain keep off,
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>Disjoined from the body, and that mind enjoy
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>Delightsome feeling, far from care and fear!
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>Therefore we see that our corporeal life
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>Needs little, altogether, and only such
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>As takes the pain away, and can besides
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>Strew underneath some number of delights.
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>More grateful 'tis at times (for Nature craves
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>No artifice nor luxury), if forsooth
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>There be no golden images of boys
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>Along the halls, with right hands holding out
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>The lamps ablaze, the lights for evening feasts,
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>And if the house doth glitter not with gold
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>Nor gleam with silver, and to the lyre resound
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>No fretted and gilded ceilings overhead,
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>Yet still to lounge with friends in the soft grass
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>Beside a river of water, underneath
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>A big tree's boughs, and merrily to refresh
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>Our frames, with no vast outlay- most of all
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>If the weather is laughing and the times of the 
<A NAME="52"></A>year
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>Besprinkle the green of the grass around with flowers.
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>Nor yet the quicker will hot fevers go,
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>If on a pictured tapestry thou toss,
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>Or purple robe, than if 'tis thine to lie
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>Upon the poor man's bedding. Wherefore, since
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>Treasure, nor rank, nor glory of a reign
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>Avail us naught for this our body, thus
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>Reckon them likewise nothing for the mind:
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>Save then perchance, when thou beholdest forth
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>Thy legions swarming round the Field of Mars,
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>Rousing a mimic warfare- either side
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>Strengthened with large auxiliaries and horse,
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>Alike equipped with arms, alike inspired;
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>Or save when also thou beholdest forth
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>Thy fleets to swarm, deploying down the sea:
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>For then, by such bright circumstance abashed,
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>Religion pales and flees thy mind; O then
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>The fears of death leave heart so free of care.
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>But if we note how all this pomp at last
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>Is but a drollery and a mocking sport,
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>And of a truth man's dread, with cares at heels,
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>Dreads not these sounds of arms, these savage swords
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>But among kings and lords of all the world
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>Mingles undaunted, nor is overawed
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>By gleam of gold nor by the splendour bright
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>Of purple robe, canst thou then doubt that this
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>Is aught, but power of thinking?- when, besides
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>The whole of life but labours in the dark.
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>For just as children tremble and fear all
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>In the viewless dark, so even we at times
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>Dread in the light so many things that be
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>No whit more fearsome than what children feign,
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>Shuddering, will be upon them in the dark.
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>This terror then, this darkness of the mind,
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>Not sunrise with its flaring spokes of light,
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>Nor glittering arrows of morning can disperse,
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>But only Nature's aspect and her law.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="90"></A><B>Atomic Motions</B>

<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR>Now come: I will untangle for thy steps
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>Now by what motions the begetting bodies
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>Of the world-stuff beget the varied world,
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>And then forever resolve it when begot,
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>And by what force they are constrained to this,
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>And what the speed appointed unto them
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>Wherewith to travel down the vast inane:
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>Do thou remember to yield thee to my words.
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>For truly matter coheres not, crowds not tight,
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>Since we behold each thing to wane away,
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>And we observe how all flows on and off,
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>As 'twere, with age-old time, and from our eyes
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>How eld withdraws each object at the end,
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>Albeit the sum is seen to bide the same,
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>Unharmed, because these motes that leave each thing
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>Diminish what they part from, but endow
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>With increase those to which in turn they come,
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>Constraining these to wither in old age,
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>And those to flower at the prime (and yet
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>Biding not long among them). Thus the sum
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>Forever is replenished, and we live
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>As mortals by eternal give and take.
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>The nations wax, the nations wane away;
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>In a brief space the generations pass,
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>And like to runners hand the lamp of life
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>One unto other.
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>But if thou believe
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>That the primordial germs of things can stop,
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>And in their stopping give new motions birth,
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>Afar thou wanderest from the road of truth.
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>For since they wander through the void inane,
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>All the primordial germs of things must needs
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>Be borne along, either by weight their own,
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>Or haply by another's blow without.
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>For, when, in their incessancy so oft
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>They meet and clash, it comes to pass amain
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>They leap asunder, face to face: not strange-
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>Being most hard, and solid in their weights,
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>And naught opposing motion, from behind.
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>And that more clearly thou perceive how all
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>These mites of matter are darted round about,
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>Recall to mind how nowhere in the sum
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>Of All exists a bottom,- nowhere is
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>A realm of rest for primal bodies; since
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>(As amply shown and proved by reason sure)
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>Space has no bound nor measure, and extends
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>Unmetered forth in all directions round.
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>Since this stands certain, thus 'tis out of doubt
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>No rest is rendered to the primal bodies
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>Along the unfathomable inane; but rather,
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>Inveterately plied by motions mixed,
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>Some, at their jamming, bound aback and leave
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>Huge gaps between, and some from off the blow
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>Are hurried about with spaces small between.
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>And all which, brought together with slight gaps,
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>In more condensed union bound aback,
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>Linked by their own all intertangled shapes,-
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>These form the irrefragable roots of rocks
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>And the brute bulks of iron, and what else
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>Is of their kind...
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>The rest leap far asunder, far recoil,
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>Leaving huge gaps between: and these supply
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>For us thin air and splendour-lights of the sun.
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>And many besides wander the mighty void-
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>Cast back from unions of existing things,
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>Nowhere accepted in the universe,
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>And nowise linked in motions to the rest.
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>And of this fact (as I record it here)
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>An image, a type goes on before our eyes
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>Present each moment; for behold whenever
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>The sun's light and the rays, let in, pour down
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>Across dark halls of houses: thou wilt see
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>The many mites in many a manner mixed
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>Amid a void in the very light of the rays,
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>And battling on, as in eternal strife,
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>And in battalions contending without halt,
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>In meetings, partings, harried up and down.
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>From this thou mayest conjecture of what sort
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>The ceaseless tossing of primordial seeds
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>Amid the mightier void- at least so far
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>As small affair can for a vaster serve,
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>And by example put thee on the spoor
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>Of knowledge. For this reason too 'tis fit
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>Thou turn thy mind the more unto these bodies
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>Which here are witnessed tumbling in the light:
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>Namely, because such tumblings are a sign
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>That motions also of the primal stuff
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>Secret and viewless lurk beneath, behind.
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>For thou wilt mark here many a speck, impelled
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>By viewless blows, to change its little course,
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>And beaten backwards to return again,
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>Hither and thither in all directions round.
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>Lo, all their shifting movement is of old,
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>From the primeval atoms; for the same
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>Primordial seeds of things first move of self,
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>And then those bodies built of unions small
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>And nearest, as it were, unto the powers
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>Of the primeval atoms, are stirred up
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>By impulse of those atoms' unseen blows,
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>And these thereafter goad the next in size;
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>Thus motion ascends from the primevals on,
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>And stage by stage emerges to our sense,
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>Until those objects also move which we
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>Can mark in sunbeams, though it not appears
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>What blows do urge them.
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>Herein wonder not
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>How 'tis that, while the seeds of things are all
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>Moving forever, the sum yet seems to stand
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>Supremely still, except in cases where
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>A thing shows motion of its frame as whole.
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>For far beneath the ken of senses lies
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>The nature of those ultimates of the world;
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>And so, since those themselves thou canst not see,
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>Their motion also must they veil from men-
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>For mark, indeed, how things we can see, oft
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>Yet hide their motions, when afar from us
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>Along the distant landscape. Often thus,
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>Upon a hillside will the woolly flocks
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>Be cropping their goodly food and creeping about
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>Whither the summons of the grass, begemmed
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>With the fresh dew, is calling, and the lambs
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>Well filled, are frisking, locking horns in sport:
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>Yet all for us seem blurred and blent afar-
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>A glint of white at rest on a green hill.
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>Again, when mighty legions, marching round,
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>Fill all the quarters of the plains below,
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>Rousing a mimic warfare, there the sheen
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>Shoots up the sky, and all the fields about
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>Glitter with brass, and from beneath, a sound
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>Goes forth from feet of stalwart soldiery,
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>And mountain walls, smote by the shouting, send
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>The voices onward to the stars of heaven,
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>And hither and thither darts the cavalry,
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>And of a sudden down the midmost fields
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>Charges with onset stout enough to rock
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>The solid earth: and yet some post there is
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>Up the high mountains, viewed from which they seem
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>To stand- a gleam at rest along the plains.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR><BR>Now what the speed to matter's atoms given
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>Thou mayest in few, my Memmius, learn from this:
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>When first the dawn is sprinkling with new light
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>The lands, and all the breed of birds abroad
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>Flit round the trackless forests, with liquid notes
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>Filling the regions along the mellow air,
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>We see 'tis forthwith manifest to man
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>How suddenly the risen sun is wont
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>At such an hour to overspread and clothe
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>The whole with its own splendour; but the sun's
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>Warm exhalations and this serene light
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>Travel not down an empty void; and thus
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>They are compelled more slowly to advance,
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>Whilst, as it were, they cleave the waves of air;
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>Nor one by one travel these particles
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>Of the warm exhalations, but are all
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>Entangled and enmassed, whereby at once
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>Each is restrained by each, and from without
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>Checked, till compelled more slowly to advance.
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>But the primordial atoms with their old
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>Simple solidity, when forth they travel
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>Along the empty void, all undelayed
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>By aught outside them there, and they, each one
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>Being one unit from nature of its parts,
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>Are borne to that one place on which they strive
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>Still to lay hold, must then, beyond a doubt,
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>Outstrip in speed, and be more swiftly borne
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>Than light of sun, and over regions rush,
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>Of space much vaster, in the self-same time
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>The sun's effulgence widens round the sky.
<A NAME="259"></A><BR><BR>Nor to pursue the atoms one by one,
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>To see the law whereby each thing goes on.
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>But some men, ignorant of matter, think,
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>Opposing this, that not without the gods,
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>In such adjustment to our human ways,
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>Can Nature change the seasons of the years,
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>And bring to birth the grains and all of else
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>To which divine Delight, the guide of life,
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>Persuades mortality and leads it on,
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>That, through her artful blandishments of love,
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>It propagate the generations still,
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>Lest humankind should perish. When they feign
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>That gods have stablished all things but for man,
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>They seem in all ways mightily to lapse
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>From reason's truth: for ev'n if ne'er I knew
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>What seeds primordial are, yet would I dare
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>This to affirm, ev'n from deep judgment based
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>Upon the ways and conduct of the skies-
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>This to maintain by many a fact besides-
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>That in no wise the nature of the world
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>For us was builded by a power divine-
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>So great the faults it stands encumbered with:
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>The which, my Memmius, later on, for thee
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>We will clear up. Now as to what remains
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>Concerning motions we'll unfold our thought.
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>Now is the place, meseems, in these affairs
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>To prove for thee this too: nothing corporeal
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>Of its own force can e'er be upward borne,
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>Or upward go- nor let the bodies of flames
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>Deceive thee here: for they engendered are
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>With urge to upwards, taking thus increase,
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>Whereby grow upwards shining grains and trees,
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>Though all the weight within them downward bears.
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>Nor, when the fires will leap from under round
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>The roofs of houses, and swift flame laps up
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>Timber and beam, 'tis then to be supposed
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>They act of own accord, no force beneath
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>To urge them up. 'Tis thus that blood, discharged
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>From out our bodies, spurts its jets aloft
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>And spatters gore. And hast thou never marked
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>With what a force the water will disgorge
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>Timber and beam? The deeper, straight and down,
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>We push them in, and, many though we be,
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>The more we press with main and toil, the more
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>The water vomits up and flings them back,
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>That, more than half their length, they there emerge,
<A NAME="305"></A><BR><B>Rebounding.</B> Yet we never doubt, meseems,
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>That all the weight within them downward bears
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>Through empty void. Well, in like manner, flames
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>Ought also to be able, when pressed out,
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>Through winds of air to rise aloft, even though
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>The weight within them strive to draw them down.
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>Hast thou not seen, sweeping so far and high,
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>The meteors, midnight flambeaus of the sky,
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>How after them they draw long trails of flame
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>Wherever Nature gives a thoroughfare?
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>How stars and constellations drop to earth,
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>Seest not? Nay, too, the sun from peak of heaven
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>Sheds round to every quarter its large heat,
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>And sows the new-ploughed intervales with light:
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>Thus also sun's heat downward tends to earth.
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>Athwart the rain thou seest the lightning fly;
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>Now here, now there, bursting from out the clouds,
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>The fires dash zig-zag- and that flaming power
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>Falls likewise down to earth.
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>In these affairs
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>We wish thee also well aware of this:
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>The atoms, as their own weight bears them down
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>Plumb through the void, at scarce determined times,
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>In scarce determined places, from their course
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>Decline a little- call it, so to speak,
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>Mere changed trend. For were it not their wont
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>Thuswise to swerve, down would they fall, each one,
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>Like drops of rain, through the unbottomed void;
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>And then collisions ne'er could be nor blows
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>Among the primal elements; and thus
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>Nature would never have created aught.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR><BR>But, if perchance be any that believe
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>The heavier bodies, as more swiftly borne
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>Plumb down the void, are able from above
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>To strike the lighter, thus engendering blows
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>Able to cause those procreant motions, far
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>From highways of true reason they retire.
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>For whatsoever through the waters fall,
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>Or through thin air, must their descent,
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>Each after its weight- on this account, because
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>Both bulk of water and the subtle air
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>By no means can retard each thing alike,
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>But give more quick before the heavier weight;
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>But contrariwise the empty void cannot,
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>On any side, at any time, to aught
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>Oppose resistance, but will ever yield,
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>True to its bent of nature. Wherefore all,
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>With equal speed, though equal not in weight,
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>Must rush, borne downward through the still inane.
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>Thus ne'er at all have heavier from above
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>Been swift to strike the lighter, gendering strokes
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>Which cause those divers motions, by whose means
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>Nature transacts her work. And so I say,
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>The atoms must a little swerve at times-
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>But only the least, lest we should seem to feign
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>Motions oblique, and fact refute us there.
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>For this we see forthwith is manifest:
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>Whatever the weight, it can't obliquely go,
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>Down on its headlong journey from above,
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>At least so far as thou canst mark; but who
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>Is there can mark by sense that naught can swerve
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>At all aside from off its road's straight line?
<A NAME="367"></A><BR><BR>Again, if ev'r all motions are co-linked,
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>And from the old ever arise the new
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>In fixed order, and primordial seeds
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>Produce not by their swerving some new start
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>Of motion to sunder the covenants of fate,
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>That cause succeed not cause from everlasting,
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>Whence this free will for creatures o'er the lands,
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>Whence is it wrested from the fates,- this will
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>Whereby we step right forward where desire
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>Leads each man on, whereby the same we swerve
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>In motions, not as at some fixed time,
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>Nor at some fixed line of space, but where
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>The mind itself has urged? For out of doubt
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>In these affairs 'tis each man's will itself
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>That gives the start, and hence throughout our limbs
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>Incipient motions are diffused. Again,
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>Dost thou not see, when, at a point of time,
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>The bars are opened, how the eager strength
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>Of horses cannot forward break as soon
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>As pants their mind to do? For it behooves
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>That all the stock of matter, through the frame,
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>Be roused, in order that, through every joint,
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>Aroused, it press and follow mind's desire;
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>So thus thou seest initial motion's gendered
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>From out the heart, aye, verily, proceeds
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>First from the spirit's will, whence at the last
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>'Tis given forth through joints and body entire.
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>Quite otherwise it is, when forth we move,
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>Impelled by a blow of another's mighty powers
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>And mighty urge; for then 'tis clear enough
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>All matter of our total body goes,
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>Hurried along, against our own desire-
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>Until the will has pulled upon the reins
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>And checked it back, throughout our members all;
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>At whose arbitrament indeed sometimes
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>The stock of matter's forced to change its path,
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>Throughout our members and throughout our joints,
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>And, after being forward cast, to be
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>Reined up, whereat it settles back again.
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>So seest thou not, how, though external force
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>Drive men before, and often make them move,
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>Onward against desire, and headlong snatched,
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>Yet is there something in these breasts of ours
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>Strong to combat, strong to withstand the same?-
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>Wherefore no less within the primal seeds
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>Thou must admit, besides all blows and weight,
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>Some other cause of motion, whence derives
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>This power in us inborn, of some free act.-
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>Since naught from nothing can become, we see.
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>For weight prevents all things should come to pass
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>Through blows, as 'twere, by some external force;
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>But that man's mind itself in all it does
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>Hath not a fixed necessity within,
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>Nor is not, like a conquered thing, compelled
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>To bear and suffer,- this state comes to man
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>From that slight swervement of the elements
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>In no fixed line of space, in no fixed time.
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>Nor ever was the stock of stuff more crammed,
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>Nor ever, again, sundered by bigger gaps:
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>For naught gives increase and naught takes away;
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>On which account, just as they move to-day,
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>The elemental bodies moved of old
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>And shall the same hereafter evermore.
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>And what was wont to be begot of old
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>Shall be begotten under selfsame terms
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>And grow and thrive in power, so far as given
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>To each by Nature's changeless, old decrees.
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>The sum of things there is no power can change,
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>For naught exists outside, to which can flee
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>Out of the world matter of any kind,
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>Nor forth from which a fresh supply can spring,
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>Break in upon the founded world, and change
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>Whole nature of things, and turn their motions about.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="440"></A><B>Atomic Forms and Their Combinations</B>

<A NAME="441"></A><BR><BR>Now come, and next hereafter apprehend
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>What sorts, how vastly different in form,
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>How varied in multitudinous shapes they are-
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>These old beginnings of the universe;
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>Not in the sense that only few are furnished
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>With one like form, but rather not at all
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>In general have they likeness each with each,
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>No marvel: since the stock of them's so great
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>That there's no end (as I have taught) nor sum,
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>They must indeed not one and all be marked
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>By equal outline and by shape the same.
<A NAME="452"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, humankind, and the mute flocks
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>Of scaly creatures swimming in the streams,
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>And joyous herds around, and all the wild,
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>And all the breeds of birds- both those that teem
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>In gladsome regions of the water-haunts,
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>About the river-banks and springs and pools,
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>And those that throng, flitting from tree to tree,
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>Through trackless woods- Go, take which one thou 
<A NAME="460"></A>wilt,
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>In any kind: thou wilt discover still
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>Each from the other still unlike in shape.
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>Nor in no other wise could offspring know
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>Mother, nor mother offspring- which we see
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>They yet can do, distinguished one from other,
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>No less than human beings, by clear signs.
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>Thus oft before fair temples of the gods,
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>Beside the incense-burning altars slain,
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>Drops down the yearling calf, from out its breast
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>Breathing warm streams of blood; the orphaned mother,
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>Ranging meanwhile green woodland pastures round,
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>Knows well the footprints, pressed by cloven hoofs,
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>With eyes regarding every spot about,
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>For sight somewhere of youngling gone from her;
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>And, stopping short, filleth the leafy lanes
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>With her complaints; and oft she seeks again
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>Within the stall, pierced by her yearning still.
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>Nor tender willows, nor dew-quickened grass,
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>Nor the loved streams that glide along low banks,
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>Can lure her mind and turn the sudden pain;
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>Nor other shapes of calves that graze thereby
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>Distract her mind or lighten pain the least-
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>So keen her search for something known and hers.
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>Moreover, tender kids with bleating throats
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>Do know their horned dams, and butting lambs
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>The flocks of sheep, and thus they patter on,
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>Unfailingly each to its proper teat,
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>As Nature intends. Lastly, with any grain,
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>Thou'lt see that no one kernel in one kind
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>Is so far like another, that there still
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>Is not in shapes some difference running through.
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>By a like law we see how earth is pied
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>With shells and conchs, where, with soft waves, the 
<A NAME="494"></A>sea
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>Beats on the thirsty sands of curving shores.
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>Wherefore again, again, since seeds of things
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>Exist by nature, nor were wrought with hands
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>After a fixed pattern of one other,
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>They needs must flitter to and fro with shapes
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>In types dissimilar to one another.
<A NAME="501"></A><BR><BR>Easy enough by thought of mind to solve
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>Why fires of lightning more can penetrate
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>Than these of ours from pitch-pine born on earth.
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>For thou canst say lightning's celestial fire,
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>So subtle, is formed of figures finer far,
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>And passes thus through holes which this our fire,
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>Born from the wood, created from the pine,
<A NAME="508"></A><BR><B>Cannot.</B> Again, light passes through the horn
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>On the lantern's side, while rain is dashed away.
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>And why?- unless those bodies of light should be
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>Finer than those of water's genial showers.
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>We see how quickly through a colander
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>The wines will flow; how, on the other hand,
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>The sluggish olive-oil delays: no doubt,
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>Because 'tis wrought of elements more large,
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>Or else more crook'd and intertangled. Thus
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>It comes that the primordials cannot be
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>So suddenly sundered one from other, and seep,
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>One through each several hole of anything.
<A NAME="520"></A><BR><BR>And note, besides, that liquor of honey or milk
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>Yields in the mouth agreeable taste to tongue,
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>Whilst nauseous wormwood, pungent centaury,
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>With their foul flavour set the lips awry;
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>Thus simple 'tis to see that whatsoever
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>Can touch the senses pleasingly are made
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>Of smooth and rounded elements, whilst those
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>Which seem the bitter and the sharp, are held
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>Entwined by elements more crook'd, and so
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>Are wont to tear their ways into our senses,
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>And rend our body as they enter in.
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>In short all good to sense, all bad to touch,
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>Being up-built of figures so unlike,
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>Are mutually at strife- lest thou suppose
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>That the shrill rasping of a squeaking saw
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>Consists of elements as smooth as song
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>Which, waked by nimble fingers, on the strings
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>The sweet musicians fashion; or suppose
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>That same-shaped atoms through men's nostrils pierce
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>When foul cadavers burn, as when the stage
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>Is with Cilician saffron sprinkled fresh,
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>And the altar near exhales Panchaean scent;
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>Or hold as of like seed the goodly hues
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>Of things which feast our eyes, as those which sting
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>Against the smarting pupil and draw tears,
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>Or show, with gruesome aspect, grim and vile.
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>For never a shape which charms our sense was made
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>Without some elemental smoothness; whilst
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>Whate'er is harsh and irksome has been framed
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>Still with some roughness in its elements.
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>Some, too, there are which justly are supposed
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>To be nor smooth nor altogether hooked,
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>With bended barbs, but slightly angled-out,
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>To tickle rather than to wound the sense-
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>And of which sort is the salt tartar of wine
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>And flavours of the gummed elecampane.
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>Again, that glowing fire and icy rime
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>Are fanged with teeth unlike whereby to sting
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>Our body's sense, the touch of each gives proof.
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>For touch- by sacred majesties of gods!-
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>Touch is indeed the body's only sense-
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>Be't that something in-from-outward works,
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>Be't that something in the body born
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>Wounds, or delighteth as it passes out
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>Along the procreant paths of Aphrodite;
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>Or be't the seeds by some collision whirl
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>Disordered in the body and confound
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>By tumult and confusion all the sense-
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>As thou mayst find, if haply with the hand
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>Thyself thou strike thy body's any part.
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>On which account, the elemental forms
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>Must differ widely, as enabled thus
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>To cause diverse sensations.
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>And, again,
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>What seems to us the hardened and condensed
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>Must be of atoms among themselves more hooked,
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>Be held compacted deep within, as 'twere
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>By branch-like atoms- of which sort the chief
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>Are diamond stones, despisers of all blows,
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>And stalwart flint and strength of solid iron,
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>And brazen bars, which, budging hard in locks,
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>Do grate and scream. But what are liquid, formed
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>Of fluid body, they indeed must be
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>Of elements more smooth and round- because
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>Their globules severally will not cohere:
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>To suck the poppy-seeds from palm of hand
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>Is quite as easy as drinking water down,
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>And they, once struck, roll like unto the same.
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>But that thou seest among the things that flow
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>Some bitter, as the brine of ocean is,
<A NAME="590"></A><BR>Is not the least a marvel...
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>For since 'tis fluid, smooth its atoms are
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>And round, with painful rough ones mixed therein;
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>Yet need not these be held together hooked:
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>In fact, though rough, they're globular besides,
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>Able at once to roll, and rasp the sense.
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>And that the more thou mayst believe me here,
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>That with smooth elements are mixed the rough
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>(Whence Neptune's salt astringent body comes),
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>There is a means to separate the twain,
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>And thereupon dividedly to see
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>How the sweet water, after filtering through
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>So often underground, flows freshened forth
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>Into some hollow; for it leaves above
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>The primal germs of nauseating brine,
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>Since cling the rough more readily in earth.
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>Lastly, whatso thou markest to disperse
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>Upon the instant- smoke, and cloud, and flame-
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>Must not (even though not all of smooth and round)
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>Be yet co-linked with atoms intertwined,
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>That thus they can, without together cleaving,
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>So pierce our body and so bore the rocks.
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>Whatever we see...
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>Given to senses, that thou must perceive
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>They're not from linked but pointed elements.
<A NAME="615"></A><BR><BR>The which now having taught, I will go on
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>To bind thereto a fact to this allied
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>And drawing from this its proof: these primal germs
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>Vary, yet only with finite tale of shapes.
<A NAME="619"></A><BR>For were these shapes quite infinite, some seeds
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>Would have a body of infinite increase.
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>For in one seed, in one small frame of any,
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>The shapes can't vary from one another much.
<A NAME="623"></A><BR>Assume, we'll say, that of three minim parts
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>Consist the primal bodies, or add a few:
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>When, now, by placing all these parts of one
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>At top and bottom, changing lefts and rights,
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>Thou hast with every kind of shift found out
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>What the aspect of shape of its whole body
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>Each new arrangement gives, for what remains,
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>If thou percase wouldst vary its old shapes,
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>New parts must then be added; 'twill follow next,
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>If thou percase wouldst vary still its shapes,
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>That by like logic each arrangement still
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>Requires its increment of other parts.
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>Ergo, an augmentation of its frame
<A NAME="636"></A><BR>Follows upon each novelty of forms.
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>Wherefore, it cannot be thou'lt undertake
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>That seeds have infinite differences in form,
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>Lest thus thou forcest some indeed to be
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>Of an immeasurable immensity-
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>Which I have taught above cannot be proved.
<A NAME="642"></A><BR><BR>And now for thee barbaric robes, and gleam
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>Of Meliboean purple, touched with dye
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>Of the Thessalian shell...
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>The peacock's golden generations, stained
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>With spotted gaieties, would lie o'erthrown
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>By some new colour of new things more bright;
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>The odour of myrrh and savours of honey despised;
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>The swan's old lyric, and Apollo's hymns,
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>Once modulated on the many chords,
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>Would likewise sink o'ermastered and be mute:
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>For, lo, a somewhat, finer than the rest,
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>Would be arising evermore. So, too,
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>Into some baser part might all retire,
<A NAME="655"></A><BR>Even as we said to better might they come:
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>For, lo, a somewhat, loathlier than the rest
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>To nostrils, ears, and eyes, and taste of tongue,
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>Would then, by reasoning reversed, be there.
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>Since 'tis not so, but unto things are given
<A NAME="660"></A><BR>Their fixed limitations which do bound
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>Their sum on either side, 'tmust be confessed
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>That matter, too, by finite tale of shapes
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>Does differ. Again, from earth's midsummer heats
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>Unto the icy hoar-frosts of the year
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>The forward path is fixed, and by like law
<A NAME="666"></A><BR>O'ertravelled backwards at the dawn of spring.
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>For each degree of hat, and each of cold,
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>And the half-warm, all filling up the sum
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>In due progression, lie, my Memmius, there
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>Betwixt the two extremes: the things create
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>Must differ, therefore, by a finite change,
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>Since at each end marked off they ever are
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>By fixed point- on one side plagued by flames
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>And on the other by congealing frosts.
<A NAME="675"></A><BR><BR>The which now having taught, I will go on
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>To bind thereto a fact to this allied
<A NAME="677"></A><BR>And drawing from this its proof: those primal germs
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>Which have been fashioned all of one like shape
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>Are infinite in tale; for, since the forms
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>Themselves are finite in divergences,
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>Then those which are alike will have to be
<A NAME="682"></A><BR>Infinite, else the sum of stuff remains
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>A finite- what I've proved is not the fact,
<A NAME="684"></A><BR>Showing in verse how corpuscles of stuff,
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>From everlasting and to-day the same,
<A NAME="686"></A><BR>Uphold the sum of things, all sides around
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>By old succession of unending blows.
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>For though thou view'st some beasts to be more rare,
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>And mark'st in them a less prolific stock,
<A NAME="690"></A><BR>Yet in another region, in lands remote,
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>That kind abounding may make up the count;
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>Even as we mark among the four-foot kind
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>Snake-handed elephants, whose thousands wall
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>With ivory ramparts India about,
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>That her interiors cannot entered be-
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>So big her count of brutes of which we see
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>Such few examples. Or suppose, besides,
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>We feign some thing, one of its kind and sole
<A NAME="699"></A><BR>With body born, to which is nothing like
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>In all the lands: yet now unless shall be
<A NAME="701"></A><BR>An infinite count of matter out of which
<A NAME="702"></A><BR>Thus to conceive and bring it forth to life,
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>It cannot be created and- what's more-
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>It cannot take its food and get increase.
<A NAME="705"></A><BR>Yea, if through all the world in finite tale
<A NAME="706"></A><BR>Be tossed the procreant bodies of one thing,
<A NAME="707"></A><BR>Whence, then, and where in what mode, by what power,
<A NAME="708"></A><BR>Shall they to meeting come together there,
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>In such vast ocean of matter and tumult strange?-
<A NAME="710"></A><BR>No means they have of joining into one.
<A NAME="711"></A><BR>But, just as, after mighty shipwrecks piled,
<A NAME="712"></A><BR>The mighty main is wont to scatter wide
<A NAME="713"></A><BR>The rowers' banks, the ribs, the yards, the prow,
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>The masts and swimming oars, so that afar
<A NAME="715"></A><BR>Along all shores of lands are seen afloat
<A NAME="716"></A><BR>The carven fragments of the rended poop,
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>Giving a lesson to mortality
<A NAME="718"></A><BR>To shun the ambush of the faithless main,
<A NAME="719"></A><BR>The violence and the guile, and trust it not
<A NAME="720"></A><BR>At any hour, however much may smile
<A NAME="721"></A><BR>The crafty enticements of the placid deep:
<A NAME="722"></A><BR>Exactly thus, if once thou holdest true
<A NAME="723"></A><BR>That certain seeds are finite in their tale,
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>The various tides of matter, then, must needs
<A NAME="725"></A><BR>Scatter them flung throughout the ages all,
<A NAME="726"></A><BR>So that not ever can they join, as driven
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>Together into union, nor remain
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>In union, nor with increment can grow-
<A NAME="729"></A><BR>But facts in proof are manifest for each:
<A NAME="730"></A><BR>Things can be both begotten and increase.
<A NAME="731"></A><BR>'Tis therefore manifest that primal germs,
<A NAME="732"></A><BR>Are infinite in any class thou wilt-
<A NAME="733"></A><BR>From whence is furnished matter for all things.
<A NAME="734"></A><BR><BR>Nor can those motions that bring death prevail
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>Forever, nor eternally entomb
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>The welfare of the world; nor, further, can
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>Those motions that give birth to things and growth
<A NAME="738"></A><BR>Keep them forever when created there.
<A NAME="739"></A><BR>Thus the long war, from everlasting waged,
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>With equal strife among the elements
<A NAME="741"></A><BR>Goes on and on. Now here, now there, prevail
<A NAME="742"></A><BR>The vital forces of the world- or fall.
<A NAME="743"></A><BR>Mixed with the funeral is the wildered wail
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>Of infants coming to the shores of light:
<A NAME="745"></A><BR>No night a day, no dawn a night hath followed
<A NAME="746"></A><BR>That heard not, mingling with the small birth-cries,
<A NAME="747"></A><BR>The wild laments, companions old of death
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>And the black rites.
<A NAME="749"></A><BR>This, too, in these affairs
<A NAME="750"></A><BR>'Tis fit thou hold well sealed, and keep consigned
<A NAME="751"></A><BR>With no forgetting brain: nothing there is
<A NAME="752"></A><BR>Whose nature is apparent out of hand
<A NAME="753"></A><BR>That of one kind of elements consists-
<A NAME="754"></A><BR>Nothing there is that's not of mixed seed.
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>And whatsoe'er possesses in itself
<A NAME="756"></A><BR>More largely many powers and properties
<A NAME="757"></A><BR>Shows thus that here within itself there are
<A NAME="758"></A><BR>The largest number of kinds and differing shapes
<A NAME="759"></A><BR>Of elements. And, chief of all, the earth
<A NAME="760"></A><BR>Hath in herself first bodies whence the springs,
<A NAME="761"></A><BR>Rolling chill waters, renew forevermore
<A NAME="762"></A><BR>The unmeasured main; hath whence the fires arise-
<A NAME="763"></A><BR>For burns in many a spot her flamed crust,
<A NAME="764"></A><BR>Whilst the impetuous Aetna raves indeed
<A NAME="765"></A><BR>From more profounder fires- and she, again,
<A NAME="766"></A><BR>Hath in herself the seed whence she can raise
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>The shining grains and gladsome trees for men;
<A NAME="768"></A><BR>Whence, also, rivers, fronds, and gladsome pastures
<A NAME="769"></A><BR>Can she supply for mountain-roaming beasts.
<A NAME="770"></A><BR>Wherefore great mother of gods, and mother of beasts,
<A NAME="771"></A><BR>And parent of man hath she alone been named.
<A NAME="772"></A><BR>Her hymned the old and learned bards of Greece
<A NAME="773"></A><BR><BR>Seated in chariot o'er the realms of air
<A NAME="774"></A><BR>To drive her team of lions, teaching thus
<A NAME="775"></A><BR>That the great earth hangs poised and cannot lie
<A NAME="776"></A><BR>Resting on other earth. Unto her car
<A NAME="777"></A><BR>They've yoked the wild beasts, since a progeny,
<A NAME="778"></A><BR>However savage, must be tamed and chid
<A NAME="779"></A><BR>By care of parents. They have girt about
<A NAME="780"></A><BR>With turret-crown the summit of her head,
<A NAME="781"></A><BR>Since, fortressed in her goodly strongholds high,
<A NAME="782"></A><BR>'Tis she sustains the cities; now, adorned
<A NAME="783"></A><BR>With that same token, to-day is carried forth,
<A NAME="784"></A><BR>With solemn awe through many a mighty land,
<A NAME="785"></A><BR>The image of that mother, the divine.
<A NAME="786"></A><BR>Her the wide nations, after antique rite,
<A NAME="787"></A><BR>Do name Idaean Mother, giving her
<A NAME="788"></A><BR>Escort of Phrygian bands, since first, they say,
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>From out those regions 'twas that grain began
<A NAME="790"></A><BR>Through all the world. To her do they assign
<A NAME="791"></A><BR>The Galli, the emasculate, since thus
<A NAME="792"></A><BR>They wish to show that men who violate
<A NAME="793"></A><BR>The majesty of the mother and have proved
<A NAME="794"></A><BR>Ingrate to parents are to be adjudged
<A NAME="795"></A><BR>Unfit to give unto the shores of light
<A NAME="796"></A><BR>A living progeny. The Galli come:
<A NAME="797"></A><BR>And hollow cymbals, tight-skinned tambourines
<A NAME="798"></A><BR>Resound around to bangings of their hands;
<A NAME="799"></A><BR>The fierce horns threaten with a raucous bray;
<A NAME="800"></A><BR>The tubed pipe excites their maddened minds
<A NAME="801"></A><BR>In Phrygian measures; they bear before them knives,
<A NAME="802"></A><BR>Wild emblems of their frenzy, which have power
<A NAME="803"></A><BR>The rabble's ingrate heads and impious hearts
<A NAME="804"></A><BR>To panic with terror of the goddess' might.
<A NAME="805"></A><BR>And so, when through the mighty cities borne,
<A NAME="806"></A><BR>She blesses man with salutations mute,
<A NAME="807"></A><BR>They strew the highway of her journeyings
<A NAME="808"></A><BR>With coin of brass and silver, gifting her
<A NAME="809"></A><BR>With alms and largesse, and shower her and shade
<A NAME="810"></A><BR>With flowers of roses falling like the snow
<A NAME="811"></A><BR>Upon the Mother and her companion-bands.
<A NAME="812"></A><BR>Here is an armed troop, the which by Greeks
<A NAME="813"></A><BR>Are called the Phrygian Curetes. Since
<A NAME="814"></A><BR>Haply among themselves they use to play
<A NAME="815"></A><BR>In games of arms and leap in measure round
<A NAME="816"></A><BR>With bloody mirth and by their nodding shake
<A NAME="817"></A><BR>The terrorizing crests upon their heads,
<A NAME="818"></A><BR>This is the armed troop that represents
<A NAME="819"></A><BR>The arm'd Dictaean Curetes, who, in Crete,
<A NAME="820"></A><BR>As runs the story, whilom did out-drown
<A NAME="821"></A><BR>That infant cry of Zeus, what time their band,
<A NAME="822"></A><BR>Young boys, in a swift dance around the boy,
<A NAME="823"></A><BR>To measured step beat with the brass on brass,
<A NAME="824"></A><BR>That Saturn might not get him for his jaws,
<A NAME="825"></A><BR>And give its mother an eternal wound
<A NAME="826"></A><BR>Along her heart. And it is on this account
<A NAME="827"></A><BR>That armed they escort the mighty Mother,
<A NAME="828"></A><BR>Or else because they signify by this
<A NAME="829"></A><BR>That she, the goddess, teaches men to be
<A NAME="830"></A><BR>Eager with armed valour to defend
<A NAME="831"></A><BR>Their motherland, and ready to stand forth,
<A NAME="832"></A><BR>The guard and glory of their parents' years.
<A NAME="833"></A><BR>A tale, however beautifully wrought,
<A NAME="834"></A><BR>That's wide of reason by a long remove:
<A NAME="835"></A><BR>For all the gods must of themselves enjoy
<A NAME="836"></A><BR>Immortal aeons and supreme repose,
<A NAME="837"></A><BR>Withdrawn from our affairs, detached, afar:
<A NAME="838"></A><BR>Immune from peril and immune from pain,
<A NAME="839"></A><BR>Themselves abounding in riches of their own,
<A NAME="840"></A><BR>Needing not us, they are not touched by wrath
<A NAME="841"></A><BR>They are not taken by service or by gift.
<A NAME="842"></A><BR>Truly is earth insensate for all time;
<A NAME="843"></A><BR>But, by obtaining germs of many things,
<A NAME="844"></A><BR>In many a way she brings the many forth
<A NAME="845"></A><BR>Into the light of sun. And here, whoso
<A NAME="846"></A><BR>Decides to call the ocean Neptune, or
<A NAME="847"></A><BR>The grain-crop Ceres, and prefers to abuse
<A NAME="848"></A><BR>The name of Bacchus rather than pronounce
<A NAME="849"></A><BR>The liquor's proper designation, him
<A NAME="850"></A><BR>Let us permit to go on calling earth
<A NAME="851"></A><BR>Mother of Gods, if only he will spare
<A NAME="852"></A><BR>To taint his soul with foul religion.
<A NAME="853"></A><BR><BR>So, too, the wooly flocks, and horned kine,
<A NAME="854"></A><BR>And brood of battle-eager horses, grazing
<A NAME="855"></A><BR>Often together along one grassy plain,
<A NAME="856"></A><BR>Under the cope of one blue sky, and slaking
<A NAME="857"></A><BR>From out one stream of water each its thirst,
<A NAME="858"></A><BR>All live their lives with face and form unlike,
<A NAME="859"></A><BR>Keeping the parents' nature, parents' habits,
<A NAME="860"></A><BR>Which, kind by kind, through ages they repeat.
<A NAME="861"></A><BR>So great in any sort of herb thou wilt,
<A NAME="862"></A><BR>So great again in any river of earth
<A NAME="863"></A><BR>Are the distinct diversities of matter.
<A NAME="864"></A><BR>Hence, further, every creature- any one
<A NAME="865"></A><BR>From out them all- compounded is the same
<A NAME="866"></A><BR>Of bones, blood, veins, heat, moisture, flesh, and 
<A NAME="867"></A>thews-
<A NAME="868"></A><BR>All differing vastly in their forms, and built
<A NAME="869"></A><BR>Of elements dissimilar in shape.
<A NAME="870"></A><BR>Again, all things by fire consumed ablaze,
<A NAME="871"></A><BR>Within their frame lay up, if naught besides,
<A NAME="872"></A><BR>At least those atoms whence derives their power
<A NAME="873"></A><BR>To throw forth fire and send out light from under,
<A NAME="874"></A><BR>To shoot the sparks and scatter embers wide.
<A NAME="875"></A><BR>If, with like reasoning of mind, all else
<A NAME="876"></A><BR>Thou traverse through, thou wilt discover thus
<A NAME="877"></A><BR>That in their frame the seeds of many things
<A NAME="878"></A><BR>They hide, and divers shapes of seeds contain.
<A NAME="879"></A><BR>Further, thou markest much, to which are given
<A NAME="880"></A><BR>Along together colour and flavour and smell,
<A NAME="881"></A><BR>Among which, chief, are most burnt offerings.
<A NAME="882"></A><BR><BR>Thus must they be of divers shapes composed.
<A NAME="883"></A><BR>A smell of scorching enters in our frame
<A NAME="884"></A><BR>Where the bright colour from the dye goes not;
<A NAME="885"></A><BR>And colour in one way, flavour in quite another
<A NAME="886"></A><BR>Works inward to our senses- so mayst see
<A NAME="887"></A><BR>They differ too in elemental shapes.
<A NAME="888"></A><BR>Thus unlike forms into one mass combine,
<A NAME="889"></A><BR>And things exist by intermixed seed.
<A NAME="890"></A><BR><BR>But still 'tmust not be thought that in all 
<A NAME="891"></A>ways
<A NAME="892"></A><BR>All things can be conjoined; for then wouldest view
<A NAME="893"></A><BR>Portents begot about thee every side:
<A NAME="894"></A><BR>Hulks of mankind half brute astarting up,
<A NAME="895"></A><BR>At times big branches sprouting from man's trunk,
<A NAME="896"></A><BR>Limbs of a sea-beast to a land-beast knit,
<A NAME="897"></A><BR>And Nature along the all-producing earth
<A NAME="898"></A><BR>Feeding those dire Chimaeras breathing flame
<A NAME="899"></A><BR>From hideous jaws- Of which 'tis simple fact
<A NAME="900"></A><BR>That none have been begot; because we see
<A NAME="901"></A><BR>All are from fixed seed and fixed dam
<A NAME="902"></A><BR>Engendered and so function as to keep
<A NAME="903"></A><BR>Throughout their growth their own ancestral type.
<A NAME="904"></A><BR>This happens surely by a fixed law:
<A NAME="905"></A><BR>For from all food-stuff, when once eaten down,
<A NAME="906"></A><BR>Go sundered atoms, suited to each creature,
<A NAME="907"></A><BR>Throughout their bodies, and, conjoining there,
<A NAME="908"></A><BR>Produce the proper motions; but we see
<A NAME="909"></A><BR>How, contrariwise, Nature upon the ground
<A NAME="910"></A><BR>Throws off those foreign to their frame; and many
<A NAME="911"></A><BR>With viewless bodies from their bodies fly,
<A NAME="912"></A><BR>By blows impelled- those impotent to join
<A NAME="913"></A><BR>To any part, or, when inside, to accord
<A NAME="914"></A><BR>And to take on the vital motions there.
<A NAME="915"></A><BR>But think not, haply, living forms alone
<A NAME="916"></A><BR>Are bound by these laws: they distinguished all.
<A NAME="917"></A><BR><BR>For just as all things of creation are,
<A NAME="918"></A><BR>In their whole nature, each to each unlike,
<A NAME="919"></A><BR>So must their atoms be in shape unlike-
<A NAME="920"></A><BR>Not since few only are fashioned of like form,
<A NAME="921"></A><BR>But since they all, as general rule, are not
<A NAME="922"></A><BR>The same as all. Nay, here in these our verses,
<A NAME="923"></A><BR>Elements many, common to many words,
<A NAME="924"></A><BR>Thou seest, though yet 'tis needful to confess
<A NAME="925"></A><BR>The words and verses differ, each from each,
<A NAME="926"></A><BR>Compounded out of different elements-
<A NAME="927"></A><BR>Not since few only, as common letters, run
<A NAME="928"></A><BR>Through all the words, or no two words are made,
<A NAME="929"></A><BR>One and the other, from all like elements,
<A NAME="930"></A><BR>But since they all, as general rule, are not
<A NAME="931"></A><BR>The same as all. Thus, too, in other things,
<A NAME="932"></A><BR>Whilst many germs common to many things
<A NAME="933"></A><BR>There are, yet they, combined among themselves,
<A NAME="934"></A><BR>Can form new who to others quite unlike.
<A NAME="935"></A><BR>Thus fairly one may say that humankind,
<A NAME="936"></A><BR>The grains, the gladsome trees, are all made up
<A NAME="937"></A><BR>Of different atoms. Further, since the seeds
<A NAME="938"></A><BR>Are different, difference must there also be
<A NAME="939"></A><BR>In intervening spaces, thoroughfares,
<A NAME="940"></A><BR>Connections, weights, blows, clashings, motions, 
<A NAME="941"></A>all
<A NAME="942"></A><BR>Which not alone distinguish living forms,
<A NAME="943"></A><BR>But sunder earth's whole ocean from the lands,
<A NAME="944"></A><BR>And hold all heaven from the lands away.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="945"></A><B>Absence of Secondary Qualities</B>

<A NAME="946"></A><BR><BR>Now come, this wisdom by my sweet toil sought
<A NAME="947"></A><BR>Look thou perceive, lest haply thou shouldst guess
<A NAME="948"></A><BR>That the white objects shining to thine eyes
<A NAME="949"></A><BR>Are gendered of white atoms, or the black
<A NAME="950"></A><BR>Of a black seed; or yet believe that aught
<A NAME="951"></A><BR>That's steeped in any hue should take its dye
<A NAME="952"></A><BR>From bits of matter tinct with hue the same.
<A NAME="953"></A><BR>For matter's bodies own no hue the least-
<A NAME="954"></A><BR>Or like to objects or, again, unlike.
<A NAME="955"></A><BR>But, if percase it seem to thee that mind
<A NAME="956"></A><BR>Itself can dart no influence of its own
<A NAME="957"></A><BR>Into these bodies, wide thou wand'rest off.
<A NAME="958"></A><BR>For since the blind-born, who have ne'er surveyed
<A NAME="959"></A><BR>The light of sun, yet recognise by touch
<A NAME="960"></A><BR>Things that from birth had ne'er a hue for them,
<A NAME="961"></A><BR>'Tis thine to know that bodies can be brought
<A NAME="962"></A><BR>No less unto the ken of our minds too,
<A NAME="963"></A><BR>Though yet those bodies with no dye be smeared.
<A NAME="964"></A><BR>Again, ourselves whatever in the dark
<A NAME="965"></A><BR>We touch, the same we do not find to be
<A NAME="966"></A><BR>Tinctured with any colour.
<A NAME="967"></A><BR>Now that here
<A NAME="968"></A><BR>I win the argument, I next will teach
<A NAME="969"></A><BR><BR>Now, every colour changes, none except,
<A NAME="970"></A><BR>And every...
<A NAME="971"></A><BR>Which the primordials ought nowise to do.
<A NAME="972"></A><BR>Since an immutable somewhat must remain,
<A NAME="973"></A><BR>Lest all things utterly be brought to naught.
<A NAME="974"></A><BR>For change of anything from out its bounds
<A NAME="975"></A><BR>Means instant death of that which was before.
<A NAME="976"></A><BR>Wherefore be mindful not to stain with colour
<A NAME="977"></A><BR>The seeds of things, lest things return for thee
<A NAME="978"></A><BR>All utterly to naught.
<A NAME="979"></A><BR>But now, if seeds
<A NAME="980"></A><BR>Receive no property of colour, and yet
<A NAME="981"></A><BR>Be still endowed with variable forms
<A NAME="982"></A><BR>From which all kinds of colours they beget
<A NAME="983"></A><BR>And vary (by reason that ever it matters much
<A NAME="984"></A><BR>With, what seeds, and in what positions joined,
<A NAME="985"></A><BR>And what the motions that they give and get),
<A NAME="986"></A><BR>Forthwith most easily thou mayst devise
<A NAME="987"></A><BR>Why what was black of hue an hour ago
<A NAME="988"></A><BR>Can of a sudden like the marble gleam,-
<A NAME="989"></A><BR>As ocean, when the high winds have upheaved
<A NAME="990"></A><BR>Its level plains, is changed to hoary waves
<A NAME="991"></A><BR>Of marble whiteness: for, thou mayst declare,
<A NAME="992"></A><BR>That, when the thing we often see as black
<A NAME="993"></A><BR>Is in its matter then commixed anew,
<A NAME="994"></A><BR>Some atoms rearranged, and some withdrawn,
<A NAME="995"></A><BR>And added some, 'tis seen forthwith to turn
<A NAME="996"></A><BR>Glowing and white. But if of azure seeds
<A NAME="997"></A><BR>Consist the level waters of the deep,
<A NAME="998"></A><BR>They could in nowise whiten: for however
<A NAME="999"></A><BR>Thou shakest azure seeds, the same can never
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR>Pass into marble hue. But, if the seeds-
<A NAME="1001"></A><BR>Which thus produce the ocean's one pure sheen-
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR>Be now with one hue, now another dyed,
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR>As oft from alien forms and divers shapes
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR>A cube's produced all uniform in shape,
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR>'Twould be but natural, even as in the cube
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR>We see the forms to be dissimilar,
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR>That thus we'd see in brightness of the deep
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR>(Or in whatever one pure sheen thou wilt)
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR>Colours diverse and all dissimilar.
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR>Besides, the unlike shapes don't thwart the least
<A NAME="1011"></A><BR>The whole in being externally a cube;
<A NAME="1012"></A><BR>But differing hues of things do block and keep
<A NAME="1013"></A><BR>The whole from being of one resultant hue.
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR>Then, too, the reason which entices us
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR>At times to attribute colours to the seeds
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR>Falls quite to pieces, since white things are not
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR>Create from white things, nor are black from black,
<A NAME="1018"></A><BR>But evermore they are create from things
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR>Of divers colours. Verily, the white
<A NAME="1020"></A><BR>Will rise more readily, is sooner born
<A NAME="1021"></A><BR>Out of no colour, than of black or aught
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR>Which stands in hostile opposition thus.
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR><BR>Besides, since colours cannot be, sans light,
<A NAME="1024"></A><BR>And the primordials come not forth to light,
<A NAME="1025"></A><BR>'Tis thine to know they are not clothed with colour-
<A NAME="1026"></A><BR>Truly, what kind of colour could there be
<A NAME="1027"></A><BR>In the viewless dark? Nay, in the light itself
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR>A colour changes, gleaming variedly,
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR>When smote by vertical or slanting ray.
<A NAME="1030"></A><BR>Thus in the sunlight shows the down of doves
<A NAME="1031"></A><BR>That circles, garlanding, the nape and throat:
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR>Now it is ruddy with a bright gold-bronze,
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR>Now, by a strange sensation it becomes
<A NAME="1034"></A><BR>Green-emerald blended with the coral-red.
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR>The peacock's tail, filled with the copious light,
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR>Changes its colours likewise, when it turns.
<A NAME="1037"></A><BR>Wherefore, since by some blow of light begot,
<A NAME="1038"></A><BR>Without such blow these colours can't become.
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR><BR>And since the pupil of the eye receives
<A NAME="1040"></A><BR>Within itself one kind of blow, when said
<A NAME="1041"></A><BR>To feel a white hue, then another kind,
<A NAME="1042"></A><BR>When feeling a black or any other hue,
<A NAME="1043"></A><BR>And since it matters nothing with what hue
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR>The things thou touchest be perchance endowed,
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR>But rather with what sort of shape equipped,
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR>'Tis thine to know the atoms need not colour,
<A NAME="1047"></A><BR>But render forth sensations, as of touch,
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR>That vary with their varied forms.
<A NAME="1049"></A><BR>Besides,
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR>Since special shapes have not a special colour,
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR>And all formations of the primal germs
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR>Can be of any sheen thou wilt, why, then,
<A NAME="1053"></A><BR>Are not those objects which are of them made
<A NAME="1054"></A><BR>Suffused, each kind with colours of every kind?
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR>For then 'twere meet that ravens, as they fly,
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR>Should dartle from white pinions a white sheen,
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR>Or swans turn black from seed of black, or be
<A NAME="1058"></A><BR>Of any single varied dye thou wilt.
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR><BR>Again, the more an object's rent to bits,
<A NAME="1060"></A><BR>The more thou see its colour fade away
<A NAME="1061"></A><BR>Little by little till 'tis quite extinct;
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR>As happens when the gaudy linen's picked
<A NAME="1063"></A><BR>Shred after shred away: the purple there,
<A NAME="1064"></A><BR>Phoenician red, most brilliant of all dyes,
<A NAME="1065"></A><BR>Is lost asunder, ravelled thread by thread;
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR>Hence canst perceive the fragments die away
<A NAME="1067"></A><BR>From out their colour, long ere they depart
<A NAME="1068"></A><BR>Back to the old primordials of things.
<A NAME="1069"></A><BR>And, last, since thou concedest not all bodies
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR>Send out a voice or smell, it happens thus
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR>That not to all thou givest sounds and smells.
<A NAME="1072"></A><BR>So, too, since we behold not all with eyes,
<A NAME="1073"></A><BR>'Tis thine to know some things there are as much
<A NAME="1074"></A><BR>Orphaned of colour, as others without smell,
<A NAME="1075"></A><BR>And reft of sound; and those the mind alert
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR>No less can apprehend than it can mark
<A NAME="1077"></A><BR>The things that lack some other qualities.
<A NAME="1078"></A><BR><BR>But think not haply that the primal bodies
<A NAME="1079"></A><BR>Remain despoiled alone of colour: so,
<A NAME="1080"></A><BR>Are they from warmth dissevered and from cold
<A NAME="1081"></A><BR>And from hot exhalations; and they move,
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR>Both sterile of sound and dry of juice; and throw
<A NAME="1083"></A><BR>Not any odour from their proper bodies.
<A NAME="1084"></A><BR>Just as, when undertaking to prepare
<A NAME="1085"></A><BR>A liquid balm of myrrh and marjoram,
<A NAME="1086"></A><BR>And flower of nard, which to our nostrils breathes
<A NAME="1087"></A><BR>Odour of nectar, first of all behooves
<A NAME="1088"></A><BR>Thou seek, as far as find thou may and can,
<A NAME="1089"></A><BR>The inodorous olive-oil (which never sends
<A NAME="1090"></A><BR>One whiff of scent to nostrils), that it may
<A NAME="1091"></A><BR>The least debauch and ruin with sharp tang
<A NAME="1092"></A><BR>The odorous essence with its body mixed
<A NAME="1093"></A><BR>And in it seethed. And on the same account
<A NAME="1094"></A><BR>The primal germs of things must not be thought
<A NAME="1095"></A><BR>To furnish colour in begetting things,
<A NAME="1096"></A><BR>Nor sound, since pow'rless they to send forth aught
<A NAME="1097"></A><BR>From out themselves, nor any flavour, too,
<A NAME="1098"></A><BR>Nor cold, nor exhalation hot or warm.
<A NAME="1099"></A><BR><BR>The rest; yet since these things are mortal 
<A NAME="1100"></A>all-
<A NAME="1101"></A><BR>The pliant mortal, with a body soft;
<A NAME="1102"></A><BR>The brittle mortal, with a crumbling frame;
<A NAME="1103"></A><BR>The hollow with a porous-all must be
<A NAME="1104"></A><BR>Disjoined from the primal elements,
<A NAME="1105"></A><BR>If still we wish under the world to lay
<A NAME="1106"></A><BR>Immortal ground-works, whereupon may rest
<A NAME="1107"></A><BR>The sum of weal and safety, lest for thee
<A NAME="1108"></A><BR>All things return to nothing utterly.
<A NAME="1109"></A><BR>Now, too: whate'er we see possessing sense
<A NAME="1110"></A><BR>Must yet confessedly be stablished all
<A NAME="1111"></A><BR>From elements insensate. And those signs,
<A NAME="1112"></A><BR>So clear to all and witnessed out of hand,
<A NAME="1113"></A><BR>Do not refute this dictum nor oppose;
<A NAME="1114"></A><BR>But rather themselves do lead us by the hand,
<A NAME="1115"></A><BR>Compelling belief that living things are born
<A NAME="1116"></A><BR>Of elements insensate, as I say.
<A NAME="1117"></A><BR>Sooth, we may see from out the stinking dung
<A NAME="1118"></A><BR>Live worms spring up, when, after soaking rains,
<A NAME="1119"></A><BR>The drenched earth rots; and all things change the 
<A NAME="1120"></A>same:
<A NAME="1121"></A><BR>Lo, change the rivers, the fronds, the gladsome 
<A NAME="1122"></A>pastures
<A NAME="1123"></A><BR>Into the cattle, the cattle their nature change
<A NAME="1124"></A><BR>Into our bodies, and from our body, oft
<A NAME="1125"></A><BR>Grow strong the powers and bodies of wild beasts
<A NAME="1126"></A><BR>And mighty-winged birds. Thus Nature changes
<A NAME="1127"></A><BR>All foods to living frames, and procreates
<A NAME="1128"></A><BR>From them the senses of live creatures all,
<A NAME="1129"></A><BR>In manner about as she uncoils in flames
<A NAME="1130"></A><BR>Dry logs of wood and turns them all to fire.
<A NAME="1131"></A><BR>And seest not, therefore, how it matters much
<A NAME="1132"></A><BR>After what order are set the primal germs,
<A NAME="1133"></A><BR>And with what other germs they all are mixed,
<A NAME="1134"></A><BR>And what the motions that they give and get?
<A NAME="1135"></A><BR><BR>But now, what is't that strikes thy sceptic 
<A NAME="1136"></A>mind,
<A NAME="1137"></A><BR>Constraining thee to sundry arguments
<A NAME="1138"></A><BR>Against belief that from insensate germs
<A NAME="1139"></A><BR>The sensible is gendered?- Verily,
<A NAME="1140"></A><BR>'Tis this: that liquids, earth, and wood, though 
<A NAME="1141"></A>mixed,
<A NAME="1142"></A><BR>Are yet unable to gender vital sense.
<A NAME="1143"></A><BR>And, therefore, 'twill be well in these affairs
<A NAME="1144"></A><BR>This to remember: that I have not said
<A NAME="1145"></A><BR>Senses are born, under conditions all,
<A NAME="1146"></A><BR>From all things absolutely which create
<A NAME="1147"></A><BR>Objects that feel; but much it matters here
<A NAME="1148"></A><BR>Firstly, how small the seeds which thus compose
<A NAME="1149"></A><BR>The feeling thing, then, with what shapes endowed,
<A NAME="1150"></A><BR>And lastly what they in positions be,
<A NAME="1151"></A><BR>In motions, in arrangements. Of which facts
<A NAME="1152"></A><BR>Naught we perceive in logs of wood and clods;
<A NAME="1153"></A><BR>And yet even these, when sodden by the rains,
<A NAME="1154"></A><BR>Give birth to wormy grubs, because the bodies
<A NAME="1155"></A><BR>Of matter, from their old arrangements stirred
<A NAME="1156"></A><BR>By the new factor, then combine anew
<A NAME="1157"></A><BR>In such a way as genders living things.
<A NAME="1158"></A><BR><BR>Next, they who deem that feeling objects can
<A NAME="1159"></A><BR>From feeling objects be create, and these,
<A NAME="1160"></A><BR>In turn, from others that are wont to feel
<A NAME="1161"></A><BR><BR>When soft they make them; for all sense is linked
<A NAME="1162"></A><BR>With flesh, and thews, and veins- and such, we see,
<A NAME="1163"></A><BR>Are fashioned soft and of a mortal frame.
<A NAME="1164"></A><BR>Yet be't that these can last forever on:
<A NAME="1165"></A><BR>They'll have the sense that's proper to a part,
<A NAME="1166"></A><BR>Or else be judged to have a sense the same
<A NAME="1167"></A><BR>As that within live creatures as a whole.
<A NAME="1168"></A><BR>But of themselves those parts can never feel,
<A NAME="1169"></A><BR>For all the sense in every member back
<A NAME="1170"></A><BR>To something else refers- a severed hand,
<A NAME="1171"></A><BR>Or any other member of our frame,
<A NAME="1172"></A><BR>Itself alone cannot support sensation.
<A NAME="1173"></A><BR>It thus remains they must resemble, then,
<A NAME="1174"></A><BR>Live creatures as a whole, to have the power
<A NAME="1175"></A><BR>Of feeling sensation concordant in each part
<A NAME="1176"></A><BR>With the vital sense; and so they're bound to feel
<A NAME="1177"></A><BR>The things we feel exactly as do we.
<A NAME="1178"></A><BR>If such the case, how, then, can they be named
<A NAME="1179"></A><BR>The primal germs of things, and how avoid
<A NAME="1180"></A><BR>The highways of destruction?- since they be
<A NAME="1181"></A><BR>Mere living things and living things be all
<A NAME="1182"></A><BR>One and the same with mortal. Grant they could,
<A NAME="1183"></A><BR>Yet by their meetings and their unions all,
<A NAME="1184"></A><BR>Naught would result, indeed, besides a throng
<A NAME="1185"></A><BR>And hurly-burly all of living things-
<A NAME="1186"></A><BR>Precisely as men, and cattle, and wild beasts,
<A NAME="1187"></A><BR>By mere conglomeration each with each
<A NAME="1188"></A><BR>Can still beget not anything of new.
<A NAME="1189"></A><BR>But if by chance they lose, inside a body,
<A NAME="1190"></A><BR>Their own sense and another sense take on,
<A NAME="1191"></A><BR>What, then, avails it to assign them that
<A NAME="1192"></A><BR>Which is withdrawn thereafter? And besides,
<A NAME="1193"></A><BR>To touch on proof that we pronounced before,
<A NAME="1194"></A><BR>Just as we see the eggs of feathered fowls
<A NAME="1195"></A><BR>To change to living chicks, and swarming worms
<A NAME="1196"></A><BR>To bubble forth when from the soaking rains
<A NAME="1197"></A><BR>The earth is sodden, sure, sensations all
<A NAME="1198"></A><BR>Can out of non-sensations be begot.
<A NAME="1199"></A><BR><BR>But if one say that sense can so far rise
<A NAME="1200"></A><BR>From non-sense by mutation, or because
<A NAME="1201"></A><BR>Brought forth as by a certain sort of birth,
<A NAME="1202"></A><BR>'Twill serve to render plain to him and prove
<A NAME="1203"></A><BR>There is no birth, unless there be before
<A NAME="1204"></A><BR>Some formed union of the elements,
<A NAME="1205"></A><BR>Nor any change, unless they be unite.
<A NAME="1206"></A><BR><BR>In first place, senses can't in body be
<A NAME="1207"></A><BR>Before its living nature's been begot,-
<A NAME="1208"></A><BR>Since all its stuff, in faith, is held dispersed
<A NAME="1209"></A><BR>About through rivers, air, and earth, and all
<A NAME="1210"></A><BR>That is from earth created, nor has met
<A NAME="1211"></A><BR>In combination, and, in proper mode,
<A NAME="1212"></A><BR>Conjoined into those vital motions which
<A NAME="1213"></A><BR>Kindle the all-perceiving senses- they
<A NAME="1214"></A><BR>That keep and guard each living thing soever.
<A NAME="1215"></A><BR><BR>Again, a blow beyond its nature's strength
<A NAME="1216"></A><BR>Shatters forthwith each living thing soe'er,
<A NAME="1217"></A><BR>And on it goes confounding all the sense
<A NAME="1218"></A><BR>Of body and mind. For of the primal germs
<A NAME="1219"></A><BR>Are loosed their old arrangements, and, throughout,
<A NAME="1220"></A><BR>The vital motions blocked,- until the stuff,
<A NAME="1221"></A><BR>Shaken profoundly through the frame entire,
<A NAME="1222"></A><BR>Undoes the vital knots of soul from body
<A NAME="1223"></A><BR>And throws that soul, to outward wide-dispersed,
<A NAME="1224"></A><BR>Through all the pores. For what may we surmise
<A NAME="1225"></A><BR>A blow inflicted can achieve besides
<A NAME="1226"></A><BR>Shaking asunder and loosening all apart?
<A NAME="1227"></A><BR>It happens also, when less sharp the blow,
<A NAME="1228"></A><BR>The vital motions which are left are wont
<A NAME="1229"></A><BR>Oft to win out- win out, and stop and still
<A NAME="1230"></A><BR>The uncouth tumults gendered by the blow,
<A NAME="1231"></A><BR>And call each part to its own courses back,
<A NAME="1232"></A><BR>And shake away the motion of death which now
<A NAME="1233"></A><BR>Begins its own dominion in the body,
<A NAME="1234"></A><BR>And kindle anew the senses almost gone.
<A NAME="1235"></A><BR>For by what other means could they the more
<A NAME="1236"></A><BR>Collect their powers of thought and turn again
<A NAME="1237"></A><BR>From very doorways of destruction
<A NAME="1238"></A><BR>Back unto life, rather than pass whereto
<A NAME="1239"></A><BR>They be already well-nigh sped and so
<A NAME="1240"></A><BR>Pass quite away?
<A NAME="1241"></A><BR>Again, since pain is there
<A NAME="1242"></A><BR>Where bodies of matter, by some force stirred up,
<A NAME="1243"></A><BR>Through vitals and through joints, within their 
<A NAME="1244"></A>seats
<A NAME="1245"></A><BR>Quiver and quake inside, but soft delight,
<A NAME="1246"></A><BR>When they remove unto their place again:
<A NAME="1247"></A><BR>'Tis thine to know the primal germs can be
<A NAME="1248"></A><BR>Assaulted by no pain, nor from themselves
<A NAME="1249"></A><BR>Take no delight; because indeed they are
<A NAME="1250"></A><BR>Not made of any bodies of first things,
<A NAME="1251"></A><BR>Under whose strange new motions they might ache
<A NAME="1252"></A><BR>Or pluck the fruit of any dear new sweet.
<A NAME="1253"></A><BR>And so they must be furnished with no sense.
<A NAME="1254"></A><BR><BR>Once more, if thus, that every living thing
<A NAME="1255"></A><BR>May have sensation, needful 'tis to assign
<A NAME="1256"></A><BR>Sense also to its elements, what then
<A NAME="1257"></A><BR>Of those fixed elements from which mankind
<A NAME="1258"></A><BR>Hath been, by their peculiar virtue, formed?
<A NAME="1259"></A><BR>Of verity, they'll laugh aloud, like men,
<A NAME="1260"></A><BR>Shaken asunder by a spasm of mirth,
<A NAME="1261"></A><BR>Or sprinkle with dewy tear-drops cheeks and chins,
<A NAME="1262"></A><BR>And have the cunning hardihood to say
<A NAME="1263"></A><BR>Much on the composition of the world,
<A NAME="1264"></A><BR>And in their turn inquire what elements
<A NAME="1265"></A><BR>They have themselves,- since, thus the same in kind
<A NAME="1266"></A><BR>As a whole mortal creature, even they
<A NAME="1267"></A><BR>Must also be from other elements,
<A NAME="1268"></A><BR>And then those others from others evermore-
<A NAME="1269"></A><BR>So that thou darest nowhere make a stop.
<A NAME="1270"></A><BR>Oho, I'll follow thee until thou grant
<A NAME="1271"></A><BR>The seed (which here thou say'st speaks, laughs, and 
<A NAME="1272"></A>thinks)
<A NAME="1273"></A><BR>Is yet derived out of other seeds
<A NAME="1274"></A><BR>Which in their turn are doing just the same.
<A NAME="1275"></A><BR>But if we see what raving nonsense this,
<A NAME="1276"></A><BR>And that a man may laugh, though not, forsooth,
<A NAME="1277"></A><BR>Compounded out of laughing elements,
<A NAME="1278"></A><BR>And think and utter reason with learn'd speech,
<A NAME="1279"></A><BR>Though not himself compounded, for a fact,
<A NAME="1280"></A><BR>Of sapient seeds and eloquent, why, then,
<A NAME="1281"></A><BR>Cannot those things which we perceive to have
<A NAME="1282"></A><BR>Their own sensation be composed as well
<A NAME="1283"></A><BR>Of intermixed seeds quite void of sense?
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1284"></A><B>Infinite Worlds</B>

<A NAME="1285"></A><BR><BR>Once more, we all from seed celestial spring,
<A NAME="1286"></A><BR>To all is that same father, from whom earth,
<A NAME="1287"></A><BR>The fostering mother, as she takes the drops
<A NAME="1288"></A><BR>Of liquid moisture, pregnant bears her broods-
<A NAME="1289"></A><BR>The shining grains, and gladsome shrubs and trees,
<A NAME="1290"></A><BR>And bears the human race and of the wild
<A NAME="1291"></A><BR>The generations all, the while she yields
<A NAME="1292"></A><BR>The foods wherewith all feed their frames and lead
<A NAME="1293"></A><BR>The genial life and propagate their kind;
<A NAME="1294"></A><BR>Wherefore she owneth that maternal name,
<A NAME="1295"></A><BR>By old desert. What was before from earth,
<A NAME="1296"></A><BR>The same in earth sinks back, and what was sent
<A NAME="1297"></A><BR>From shores of ether, that, returning home,
<A NAME="1298"></A><BR>The vaults of sky receive. Nor thus doth death
<A NAME="1299"></A><BR>So far annihilate things that she destroys
<A NAME="1300"></A><BR>The bodies of matter; but she dissipates
<A NAME="1301"></A><BR>Their combinations, and conjoins anew
<A NAME="1302"></A><BR>One element with others; and contrives
<A NAME="1303"></A><BR>That all things vary forms and change their colours
<A NAME="1304"></A><BR>And get sensations and straight give them o'er.
<A NAME="1305"></A><BR>And thus may'st know it matters with what others
<A NAME="1306"></A><BR>And in what structure the primordial germs
<A NAME="1307"></A><BR>Are held together, and what motions they
<A NAME="1308"></A><BR>Among themselves do give and get; nor think
<A NAME="1309"></A><BR>That aught we see hither and thither afloat
<A NAME="1310"></A><BR>Upon the crest of things, and now a birth
<A NAME="1311"></A><BR>And straightway now a ruin, inheres at rest
<A NAME="1312"></A><BR>Deep in the eternal atoms of the world.
<A NAME="1313"></A><BR><BR>Why, even in these our very verses here
<A NAME="1314"></A><BR>It matters much with what and in what order
<A NAME="1315"></A><BR>Each element is set: the same denote
<A NAME="1316"></A><BR>Sky, and the ocean, lands, and streams, and sun;
<A NAME="1317"></A><BR>The same, the grains, and trees, and living things.
<A NAME="1318"></A><BR>And if not all alike, at least the most-
<A NAME="1319"></A><BR>But what distinctions by positions wrought!
<A NAME="1320"></A><BR>And thus no less in things themselves, when once
<A NAME="1321"></A><BR>Around are changed the intervals between,
<A NAME="1322"></A><BR>The paths of matter, its connections, weights,
<A NAME="1323"></A><BR>Blows, clashings, motions, order, structure, shapes,
<A NAME="1324"></A><BR>The things themselves must likewise changed be.
<A NAME="1325"></A><BR>Now to true reason give thy mind for us.
<A NAME="1326"></A><BR>Since here strange truth is putting forth its might
<A NAME="1327"></A><BR>To hit thee in thine ears, a new aspect
<A NAME="1328"></A><BR>Of things to show its front. Yet naught there is
<A NAME="1329"></A><BR>So easy that it standeth not at first
<A NAME="1330"></A><BR>More hard to credit than it after is;
<A NAME="1331"></A><BR>And naught soe'er that's great to such degree,
<A NAME="1332"></A><BR>Nor wonderful so far, but all mankind
<A NAME="1333"></A><BR>Little by little abandon their surprise.
<A NAME="1334"></A><BR>Look upward yonder at the bright clear sky
<A NAME="1335"></A><BR>And what it holds- the stars that wander o'er,
<A NAME="1336"></A><BR>The moon, the radiance of the splendour-sun:
<A NAME="1337"></A><BR>Yet all, if now they first for mortals were,
<A NAME="1338"></A><BR>If unforeseen now first asudden shown,
<A NAME="1339"></A><BR>What might there be more wonderful to tell,
<A NAME="1340"></A><BR>What that the nations would before have dared
<A NAME="1341"></A><BR>Less to believe might be?- I fancy, naught-
<A NAME="1342"></A><BR>So strange had been the marvel of that sight.
<A NAME="1343"></A><BR>The which o'erwearied to behold, to-day
<A NAME="1344"></A><BR>None deigns look upward to those lucent realms.
<A NAME="1345"></A><BR>Then, spew not reason from thy mind away,
<A NAME="1346"></A><BR>Beside thyself because the matter's new,
<A NAME="1347"></A><BR>But rather with keen judgment nicely weigh;
<A NAME="1348"></A><BR>And if to thee it then appeareth true,
<A NAME="1349"></A><BR>Render thy hands, or, if 'tis false at last,
<A NAME="1350"></A><BR>Gird thee to combat. For my mind-of-man
<A NAME="1351"></A><BR>Now seeks the nature of the vast Beyond
<A NAME="1352"></A><BR>There on the other side, that boundless sum
<A NAME="1353"></A><BR>Which lies without the ramparts of the world,
<A NAME="1354"></A><BR>Toward which the spirit longs to peer afar,
<A NAME="1355"></A><BR>Toward which indeed the swift elan of thought
<A NAME="1356"></A><BR>Flies unencumbered forth.
<A NAME="1357"></A><BR>Firstly, we find,
<A NAME="1358"></A><BR>Off to all regions round, on either side,
<A NAME="1359"></A><BR>Above, beneath, throughout the universe
<A NAME="1360"></A><BR>End is there none- as I have taught, as too
<A NAME="1361"></A><BR>The very thing of itself declares aloud,
<A NAME="1362"></A><BR>And as from nature of the unbottomed deep
<A NAME="1363"></A><BR>Shines clearly forth. Nor can we once suppose
<A NAME="1364"></A><BR>In any way 'tis likely, (seeing that space
<A NAME="1365"></A><BR>To all sides stretches infinite and free,
<A NAME="1366"></A><BR>And seeds, innumerable in number, in sum
<A NAME="1367"></A><BR>Bottomless, there in many a manner fly,
<A NAME="1368"></A><BR>Bestirred in everlasting motion there),
<A NAME="1369"></A><BR>That only this one earth and sky of ours
<A NAME="1370"></A><BR>Hath been create and that those bodies of stuff,
<A NAME="1371"></A><BR>So many, perform no work outside the same;
<A NAME="1372"></A><BR>Seeing, moreover, this world too hath been
<A NAME="1373"></A><BR>By Nature fashioned, even as seeds of things
<A NAME="1374"></A><BR>By innate motion chanced to clash and cling-
<A NAME="1375"></A><BR>After they'd been in many a manner driven
<A NAME="1376"></A><BR>Together at random, without design, in vain-
<A NAME="1377"></A><BR>And at last those seeds together dwelt,
<A NAME="1378"></A><BR>Which, when together of a sudden thrown,
<A NAME="1379"></A><BR>Should alway furnish the commencements fit
<A NAME="1380"></A><BR>Of mighty things- the earth, the sea, the sky,
<A NAME="1381"></A><BR>And race of living creatures. Thus, I say,
<A NAME="1382"></A><BR>Again, again, 'tmust be confessed there are
<A NAME="1383"></A><BR>Such congregations of matter otherwhere,
<A NAME="1384"></A><BR>Like this our world which vasty ether holds
<A NAME="1385"></A><BR>In huge embrace.
<A NAME="1386"></A><BR>Besides, when matter abundant
<A NAME="1387"></A><BR>Is ready there, when space on hand, nor object
<A NAME="1388"></A><BR>Nor any cause retards, no marvel 'tis
<A NAME="1389"></A><BR>That things are carried on and made complete,
<A NAME="1390"></A><BR><B>Perforce.</B> And now, if store of seeds there 
<A NAME="1391"></A>is
<A NAME="1392"></A><BR>So great that not whole life-times of the living
<A NAME="1393"></A><BR>Can count the tale...
<A NAME="1394"></A><BR>And if their force and nature abide the same,
<A NAME="1395"></A><BR>Able to throw the seeds of things together
<A NAME="1396"></A><BR>Into their places, even as here are thrown
<A NAME="1397"></A><BR>The seeds together in this world of ours,
<A NAME="1398"></A><BR>'Tmust be confessed in other realms there are
<A NAME="1399"></A><BR>Still other worlds, still other breeds of men,
<A NAME="1400"></A><BR>And other generations of the wild.
<A NAME="1401"></A><BR>Hence too it happens in the sum there is
<A NAME="1402"></A><BR>No one thing single of its kind in birth,
<A NAME="1403"></A><BR>And single and sole in growth, but rather it is
<A NAME="1404"></A><BR>One member of some generated race,
<A NAME="1405"></A><BR>Among full many others of like kind.
<A NAME="1406"></A><BR>First, cast thy mind abroad upon the living:
<A NAME="1407"></A><BR>Thou'lt find the race of mountain-ranging wild
<A NAME="1408"></A><BR>Even thus to be, and thus the scions of men
<A NAME="1409"></A><BR>To be begot, and lastly the mute flocks
<A NAME="1410"></A><BR>Of scaled fish, and winged frames of birds.
<A NAME="1411"></A><BR>Wherefore confess we must on grounds the same
<A NAME="1412"></A><BR>That earth, sun, moon, and ocean, and all else,
<A NAME="1413"></A><BR>Exist not sole and single- rather in number
<A NAME="1414"></A><BR>Exceeding number. Since that deeply set
<A NAME="1415"></A><BR>Old boundary stone of life remains for them
<A NAME="1416"></A><BR>No less, and theirs a body of mortal birth
<A NAME="1417"></A><BR>No less, than every kind which hereon earth
<A NAME="1418"></A><BR>Is so abundant in its members found.
<A NAME="1419"></A><BR>Which well perceived if thou hold in mind,
<A NAME="1420"></A><BR>Then Nature, delivered from every haughty lord,
<A NAME="1421"></A><BR>And forthwith free, is seen to do all things
<A NAME="1422"></A><BR>Herself and through herself of own accord,
<A NAME="1423"></A><BR>Rid of all gods. For- by their holy hearts
<A NAME="1424"></A><BR>Which pass in long tranquillity of peace
<A NAME="1425"></A><BR>Untroubled ages and a serene life!-
<A NAME="1426"></A><BR>Who hath the power (I ask), who hath the power
<A NAME="1427"></A><BR>To rule the sum of the immeasurable,
<A NAME="1428"></A><BR>To hold with steady hand the giant reins
<A NAME="1429"></A><BR>Of the unfathomed deep? Who hath the power
<A NAME="1430"></A><BR>At once to rule a multitude of skies,
<A NAME="1431"></A><BR>At once to heat with fires ethereal all
<A NAME="1432"></A><BR>The fruitful lands of multitudes of worlds,
<A NAME="1433"></A><BR>To be at all times in all places near,
<A NAME="1434"></A><BR>To stablish darkness by his clouds, to shake
<A NAME="1435"></A><BR>The serene spaces of the sky with sound,
<A NAME="1436"></A><BR>And hurl his lightnings,- ha, and whelm how oft
<A NAME="1437"></A><BR>In ruins his own temples, and to rave,
<A NAME="1438"></A><BR>Retiring to the wildernesses, there
<A NAME="1439"></A><BR>At practice with that thunderbolt of his,
<A NAME="1440"></A><BR>Which yet how often shoots the guilty by,
<A NAME="1441"></A><BR>And slays the honourable blameless ones!
<A NAME="1442"></A><BR><BR>Ere since the birth-time of the world, ere since
<A NAME="1443"></A><BR>The risen first-born day of sea, earth, sun,
<A NAME="1444"></A><BR>Have many germs been added from outside,
<A NAME="1445"></A><BR>Have many seeds been added round about,
<A NAME="1446"></A><BR>Which the great All, the while it flung them on,
<A NAME="1447"></A><BR>Brought hither, that from them the sea and lands
<A NAME="1448"></A><BR>Could grow more big, and that the house of heaven
<A NAME="1449"></A><BR>Might get more room and raise its lofty roofs
<A NAME="1450"></A><BR>Far over earth, and air arise around.
<A NAME="1451"></A><BR>For bodies all, from out all regions, are
<A NAME="1452"></A><BR>Divided by blows, each to its proper thing,
<A NAME="1453"></A><BR>And all retire to their own proper kinds:
<A NAME="1454"></A><BR>The moist to moist retires; earth gets increase
<A NAME="1455"></A><BR>From earthy body; and fires, as on a forge,
<A NAME="1456"></A><BR>Beat out new fire; and ether forges ether;
<A NAME="1457"></A><BR>Till Nature, author and ender of the world,
<A NAME="1458"></A><BR>Hath led all things to extreme bound of growth:
<A NAME="1459"></A><BR>As haps when that which hath been poured inside
<A NAME="1460"></A><BR>The vital veins of life is now no more
<A NAME="1461"></A><BR>Than that which ebbs within them and runs off.
<A NAME="1462"></A><BR>This is the point where life for each thing ends;
<A NAME="1463"></A><BR>This is the point where Nature with her powers
<A NAME="1464"></A><BR>Curbs all increase. For whatsoe'er thou seest
<A NAME="1465"></A><BR>Grow big with glad increase, and step by step
<A NAME="1466"></A><BR>Climb upward to ripe age, these to themselves
<A NAME="1467"></A><BR>Take in more bodies than they send from selves,
<A NAME="1468"></A><BR>Whilst still the food is easily infused
<A NAME="1469"></A><BR>Through all the veins, and whilst the things are 
<A NAME="1470"></A>not
<A NAME="1471"></A><BR>So far expanded that they cast away
<A NAME="1472"></A><BR>Such numerous atoms as to cause a waste
<A NAME="1473"></A><BR>Greater than nutriment whereby they wax.
<A NAME="1474"></A><BR>For 'tmust be granted, truly, that from things
<A NAME="1475"></A><BR>Many a body ebbeth and runs off;
<A NAME="1476"></A><BR>But yet still more must come, until the things
<A NAME="1477"></A><BR>Have touched development's top pinnacle;
<A NAME="1478"></A><BR>Then old age breaks their powers and ripe strength
<A NAME="1479"></A><BR>And falls away into a worser part.
<A NAME="1480"></A><BR>For ever the ampler and more wide a thing,
<A NAME="1481"></A><BR>As soon as ever its augmentation ends,
<A NAME="1482"></A><BR>It scatters abroad forthwith to all sides round
<A NAME="1483"></A><BR>More bodies, sending them from out itself.
<A NAME="1484"></A><BR>Nor easily now is food disseminate
<A NAME="1485"></A><BR>Through all its veins; nor is that food enough
<A NAME="1486"></A><BR>To equal with a new supply on hand
<A NAME="1487"></A><BR>Those plenteous exhalations it gives off.
<A NAME="1488"></A><BR>Thus, fairly, all things perish, when with ebbing
<A NAME="1489"></A><BR>They're made less dense and when from blows without
<A NAME="1490"></A><BR>They are laid low; since food at last w
