<A NAME="10"></A><B>Proem</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>I wander afield, thriving in sturdy thought,
<A NAME="12"></A><BR>Through unpathed haunts of the Pierides,
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>Trodden by step of none before. I joy
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>To come on undefiled fountains there,
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>To drain them deep; I joy to pluck new flowers,
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>To seek for this my head a signal crown
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>From regions where the Muses never yet
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>Have garlanded the temples of a man:
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>First, since I teach concerning mighty things,
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>And go right on to loose from round the mind
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>The tightened coils of dread Religion;
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>Next, since, concerning themes so dark, I frame
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>Song so pellucid, touching all throughout
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>Even with the Muses' charm- which, as 'twould seem,
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>Is not without a reasonable ground:
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>For as physicians, when they seek to give
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>Young boys the nauseous wormwood, first do touch
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>The brim around the cup with the sweet juice
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>And yellow of the honey, in order that
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>The thoughtless age of boyhood be cajoled
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>As far as the lips, and meanwhile swallow down
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>The wormwood's bitter draught, and, though befooled,
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>Be yet not merely duped, but rather thus
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>Grow strong again with recreated health:
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>So now I too (since this my doctrine seems
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>In general somewhat woeful unto those
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>Who've had it not in hand, and since the crowd
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>Starts back from it in horror) have desired
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>To expound our doctrine unto thee in song
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>Soft-speaking and Pierian, and, as 'twere,
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>To touch it with sweet honey of the Muse-
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>If by such method haply I might hold
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>The mind of thee upon these lines of ours,
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>Till thou dost learn the nature of all things
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>And understandest their utility.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="46"></A><B>Existence and Character of the Images</B>

<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR>But since I've taught already of what sort
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>The seeds of all things are, and how distinct
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>In divers forms they flit of own accord,
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>Stirred with a motion everlasting on,
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>And in what mode things be from them create,
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>And since I've taught what the mind's nature is,
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>And of what things 'tis with the body knit
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>And thrives in strength, and by what mode uptorn
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>That mind returns to its primordials,
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>Now will I undertake an argument-
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>One for these matters of supreme concern-
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>That there exist those somewhats which we call
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>The images of things: these, like to films
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>Scaled off the utmost outside of the things,
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>Flit hither and thither through the atmosphere,
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>And the same terrify our intellects,
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>Coming upon us waking or in sleep,
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>When oft we peer at wonderful strange shapes
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>And images of people lorn of light,
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>Which oft have horribly roused us when we lay
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>In slumber- that haply nevermore may we
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>Suppose that souls get loose from Acheron,
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>Or shades go floating in among the living,
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>Or aught of us is left behind at death,
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>When body and mind, destroyed together, each
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>Back to its own primordials goes away.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>And thus I say that effigies of things,
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>And tenuous shapes from off the things are sent,
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>From off the utmost outside of the things,
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>Which are like films or may be named a rind,
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>Because the image bears like look and form
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>With whatso body has shed it fluttering forth-
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>A fact thou mayst, however dull thy wits,
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>Well learn from this: mainly, because we see
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>Even 'mongst visible objects many be
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>That send forth bodies, loosely some diffused-
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>Like smoke from oaken logs and heat from fires-
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>And some more interwoven and condensed-
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>As when the locusts in the summertime
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>Put off their glossy tunics, or when calves
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>At birth drop membranes from their body's surface,
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>Or when, again, the slippery serpent doffs
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>Its vestments 'mongst the thorns- for oft we see
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>The breres augmented with their flying spoils:
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>Since such takes place, 'tis likewise certain too
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>That tenuous images from things are sent,
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>From off the utmost outside of the things.
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>For why those kinds should drop and part from things,
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>Rather than others tenuous and thin,
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>No power has man to open mouth to tell;
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>Especially, since on outsides of things
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>Are bodies many and minute which could,
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>In the same order which they had before,
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>And with the figure of their form preserved,
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>Be thrown abroad, and much more swiftly too,
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>Being less subject to impediments,
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>As few in number and placed along the front.
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>For truly many things we see discharge
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>Their stuff at large, not only from their cores
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>Deep-set within, as we have said above,
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>But from their surfaces at times no less-
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>Their very colours too. And commonly
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>The awnings, saffron, red and dusky blue,
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>Stretched overhead in mighty theatres,
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>Upon their poles and cross-beams fluttering,
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>Have such an action quite; for there they dye
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>And make to undulate with their every hue
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>The circled throng below, and all the stage,
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>And rich attire in the patrician seats.
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>And ever the more the theatre's dark walls
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>Around them shut, the more all things within
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>Laugh in the bright suffusion of strange glints,
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>The daylight being withdrawn. And therefore, since
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>The canvas hangings thus discharge their dye
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>From off their surface, things in general must
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>Likewise their tenuous effigies discharge,
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>Because in either case they are off-thrown
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>From off the surface. So there are indeed
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>Such certain prints and vestiges of forms
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>Which flit around, of subtlest texture made,
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>Invisible, when separate, each and one.
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>Again, all odour, smoke, and heat, and such
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>Streams out of things diffusedly, because,
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>Whilst coming from the deeps of body forth
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>And rising out, along their bending path
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>They're torn asunder, nor have gateways straight
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>Wherethrough to mass themselves and struggle abroad.
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>But contrariwise, when such a tenuous film
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>Of outside colour is thrown off, there's naught
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>Can rend it, since 'tis placed along the front
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>Ready to hand. Lastly those images
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>Which to our eyes in mirrors do appear,
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>In water, or in any shining surface,
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>Must be, since furnished with like look of things,
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>Fashioned from images of things sent out.
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>There are, then, tenuous effigies of forms,
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>Like unto them, which no one can divine
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>When taken singly, which do yet give back,
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>When by continued and recurrent discharge
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>Expelled, a picture from the mirrors' plane.
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>Nor otherwise, it seems, can they be kept
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>So well conserved that thus be given back
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>Figures so like each object.
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>Now then, learn
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>How tenuous is the nature of an image.
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>And in the first place, since primordials be
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>So far beneath our senses, and much less
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>E'en than those objects which begin to grow
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>Too small for eyes to note, learn now in few
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>How nice are the beginnings of all things-
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>That this, too, I may yet confirm in proof:
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>First, living creatures are sometimes so small
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>That even their third part can nowise be seen;
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>Judge, then, the size of any inward organ-
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>What of their sphered heart, their eyes, their limbs,
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>The skeleton?- How tiny thus they are!
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>And what besides of those first particles
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>Whence soul and mind must fashioned be?- Seest not
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>How nice and how minute? Besides, whatever
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>Exhales from out its body a sharp smell-
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>The nauseous absinth, or the panacea,
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>Strong southernwood, or bitter centaury-
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>If never so lightly with thy [fingers] twain
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>Perchance [thou touch] a one of them
<A NAME="171"></A><BR><BR>Then why not rather know that images
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>Flit hither and thither, many, in many modes,
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>Bodiless and invisible?
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>But lest
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>Haply thou holdest that those images
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>Which come from objects are the sole that flit,
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>Others indeed there be of own accord
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>Begot, self-formed in earth's aery skies,
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>Which, moulded to innumerable shapes,
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>Are borne aloft, and, fluid as they are,
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>Cease not to change appearance and to turn
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>Into new outlines of all sorts of forms;
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>As we behold the clouds grow thick on high
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>And smirch the serene vision of the world,
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>Stroking the air with motions. For oft are seen
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>The giants' faces flying far along
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>And trailing a spread of shadow; and at times
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>The mighty mountains and mountain-sundered rocks
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>Going before and crossing on the sun,
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>Whereafter a monstrous beast dragging amain
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>And leading in the other thunderheads.
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>Now [hear] how easy and how swift they be
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>Engendered, and perpetually flow off
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>From things and gliding pass away....
<A NAME="195"></A><BR><BR>For ever every outside streams away
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>From off all objects, since discharge they may;
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>And when this outside reaches other things,
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>As chiefly glass, it passes through; but where
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>It reaches the rough rocks or stuff of wood,
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>There 'tis so rent that it cannot give back
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>An image. But when gleaming objects dense,
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>As chiefly mirrors, have been set before it,
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>Nothing of this sort happens. For it can't
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>Go, as through glass, nor yet be rent- its safety,
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>By virtue of that smoothness, being sure.
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>'Tis therefore that from them the images
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>Stream back to us; and howso suddenly
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>Thou place, at any instant, anything
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>Before a mirror, there an image shows;
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>Proving that ever from a body's surface
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>Flow off thin textures and thin shapes of things.
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>Thus many images in little time
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>Are gendered; so their origin is named
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>Rightly a speedy. And even as the sun
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>Must send below, in little time, to earth
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>So many beams to keep all things so full
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>Of light incessant; thus, on grounds the same,
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>From things there must be borne, in many modes,
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>To every quarter round, upon the moment,
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>The many images of things; because
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>Unto whatever face of things we turn
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>The mirror, things of form and hue the same
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><B>Respond.</B> Besides, though but a moment since
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>Serenest was the weather of the sky,
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>So fiercely sudden is it foully thick
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>That ye might think that round about all murk
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>Had parted forth from Acheron and filled
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>The mighty vaults of sky- so grievously,
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>As gathers thus the storm-clouds' gruesome night,
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>Do faces of black horror hang on high-
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>Of which how small a part an image is
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>There's none to tell or reckon out in words.
<A NAME="233"></A><BR><BR>Now come; with what swift motion they are borne,
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>These images, and what the speed assigned
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>To them across the breezes swimming on-
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>So that o'er lengths of space a little hour
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>Alone is wasted, toward whatever region
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>Each with its divers impulse tends- I'll tell
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>In verses sweeter than they many are;
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>Even as the swan's slight note is better far
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>Than that dispersed clamour of the cranes
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>Among the southwind's aery clouds. And first,
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>One oft may see that objects which are light
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>And made of tiny bodies are the swift;
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>In which class is the sun's light and his heat,
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>Since made from small primordial elements
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>Which, as it were, are forward knocked along
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>And through the interspaces of the air
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>To pass delay not, urged by blows behind;
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>For light by light is instantly supplied
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>And gleam by following gleam is spurred and driven.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>Thus likewise must the images have power
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>Through unimaginable space to speed
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>Within a point of time,- first, since a cause
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>Exceeding small there is, which at their back
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>Far forward drives them and propels, where, too,
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>They're carried with such winged lightness on;
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>And, secondly, since furnished, when sent off,
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>With texture of such rareness that they can
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>Through objects whatsoever penetrate
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>And ooze, as 'twere, through intervening air.
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>Besides, if those fine particles of things
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>Which from so deep within are sent abroad,
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>As light and heat of sun, are seen to glide
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>And spread themselves through all the space of heaven
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>Upon one instant of the day, and fly
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>O'er sea and lands and flood the heaven, what then
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>Of those which on the outside stand prepared,
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>When they're hurled off with not a thing to check
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>Their going out? Dost thou not see indeed
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>How swifter and how farther must they go
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>And speed through manifold the length of space
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>In time the same that from the sun the rays
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>O'erspread the heaven? This also seems to be
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>Example chief and true with what swift speed
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>The images of things are borne about:
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>That soon as ever under open skies
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>Is spread the shining water, all at once,
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>If stars be out in heaven, upgleam from earth,
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>Serene and radiant in the water there,
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>The constellations of the universe-
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>Now seest thou not in what a point of time
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>An image from the shores of ether falls
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>Unto the shores of earth? Wherefore, again,
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>And yet again, 'tis needful to confess
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>With wondrous...
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="287"></A><B>The Senses and Mental Pictures</B>

<A NAME="288"></A><BR><BR>Bodies that strike the eyes, awaking sight.
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>From certain things flow odours evermore,
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>As cold from rivers, heat from sun, and spray
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>From waves of ocean, eater-out of walls
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>Around the coasts. Nor ever cease to flit
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>The varied voices, sounds athrough the air.
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>Then too there comes into the mouth at times
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>The wet of a salt taste, when by the sea
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>We roam about; and so, whene'er we watch
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>The wormword being mixed, its bitter stings.
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>To such degree from all things is each thing
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>Borne streamingly along, and sent about
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>To every region round; and Nature grants
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>Nor rest nor respite of the onward flow,
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>Since 'tis incessantly we feeling have,
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>And all the time are suffered to descry
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>And smell all things at hand, and hear them sound.
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>Besides, since shape examined by our hands
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>Within the dark is known to be the same
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>As that by eyes perceived within the light
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>And lustrous day, both touch and sight must be
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>By one like cause aroused. So, if we test
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>A square and get its stimulus on us
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>Within the dark, within the light what square
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>Can fall upon our sight, except a square
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>That images the things? Wherefore it seems
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>The source of seeing is in images,
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>Nor without these can anything be viewed.
<A NAME="316"></A><BR><BR>Now these same films I name are borne about
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>And tossed and scattered into regions all.
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>But since we do perceive alone through eyes,
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>It follows hence that whitherso we turn
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>Our sight, all things do strike against it there
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>With form and hue. And just how far from us
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>Each thing may be away, the image yields
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>To us the power to see and chance to tell:
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>For when 'tis sent, at once it shoves ahead
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>And drives along the air that's in the space
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>Betwixt it and our eyes. And thus this air
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>All glides athrough our eyeballs, and, as 'twere,
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>Brushes athrough our pupils and thuswise
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>Passes across. Therefore it comes we see
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>How far from us each thing may be away,
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>And the more air there be that's driven before,
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>And too the longer be the brushing breeze
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>Against our eyes, the farther off removed
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>Each thing is seen to be: forsooth, this work
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>With mightily swift order all goes on,
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>So that upon one instant we may see
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>What kind the object and how far away.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR>Nor over-marvellous must this be deemed
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>In these affairs that, though the films which strike
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>Upon the eyes cannot be singly seen,
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>The things themselves may be perceived. For thus
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>When the wind beats upon us stroke by stroke
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>And when the sharp cold streams, 'tis not our wont
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>To feel each private particle of wind
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>Or of that cold, but rather all at once;
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>And so we see how blows affect our body,
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>As if one thing were beating on the same
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>And giving us the feel of its own body
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>Outside of us. Again, whene'er we thump
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>With finger-tip upon a stone, we touch
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>But the rock's surface and the outer hue,
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>Nor feel that hue by contact- rather feel
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>The very hardness deep within the rock.
<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR>Now come, and why beyond a looking-glass
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>An image may be seen, perceive. For seen
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>It soothly is, removed far within.
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>'Tis the same sort as objects peered upon
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>Outside in their true shape, whene'er a door
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>Yields through itself an open peering-place,
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>And lets us see so many things outside
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>Beyond the house. Also that sight is made
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>By a twofold twin air: for first is seen
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>The air inside the door-posts; next the doors,
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>The twain to left and right; and afterwards
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>A light beyond comes brushing through our eyes,
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>Then other air, then objects peered upon
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>Outside in their true shape. And thus, when first
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>The image of the glass projects itself,
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>As to our gaze it comes, it shoves ahead
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>And drives along the air that's in the space
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>Betwixt it and our eyes, and brings to pass
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>That we perceive the air ere yet the glass.
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>But when we've also seen the glass itself,
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>Forthwith that image which from us is borne
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>Reaches the glass, and there thrown back again
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>Comes back unto our eyes, and driving rolls
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>Ahead of itself another air, that then
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>'Tis this we see before itself, and thus
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>It looks so far removed behind the glass.
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>Wherefore again, again, there's naught for wonder
<A NAME="381"></A><BR><BR>In those which render from the mirror's plane
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>A vision back, since each thing comes to pass
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>By means of the two airs. Now, in the glass
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>The right part of our members is observed
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>Upon the left, because, when comes the image
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>Hitting against the level of the glass,
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>'Tis not returned unshifted; but forced off
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>Backwards in line direct and not oblique,-
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>Exactly as whoso his plaster-mask
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>Should dash, before 'twere dry, on post or beam,
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>And it should straightway keep, at clinging there,
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>Its shape, reversed, facing him who threw,
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>And so remould the features it gives back:
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>It comes that now the right eye is the left,
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>The left the right. An image too may be
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>From mirror into mirror handed on,
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>Until of idol-films even five or six
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>Have thus been gendered. For whatever things
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>Shall hide back yonder in the house, the same,
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>However far removed in twisting ways,
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>May still be all brought forth through bending paths
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>And by these several mirrors seen to be
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>Within the house, since Nature so compels
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>All things to be borne backward and spring off
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>At equal angles from all other things.
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>To such degree the image gleams across
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>From mirror unto mirror; where 'twas left
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>It comes to be the right, and then again
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>Returns and changes round unto the left.
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>Again, those little sides of mirrors curved
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>Proportionate to the bulge of our own flank
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>Send back to us their idols with the right
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>Upon the right; and this is so because
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>Either the image is passed on along
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>From mirror unto mirror, and thereafter,
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>When twice dashed off, flies back unto ourselves;
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>Or else the image wheels itself around,
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>When once unto the mirror it has come,
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>Since the curved surface teaches it to turn
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>To usward. Further, thou might'st well believe
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>That these film-idols step along with us
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>And set their feet in unison with ours
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>And imitate our carriage, since from that
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>Part of a mirror whence thou hast withdrawn
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>Straightway no images can be returned.
<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR>Further, our eye-balls tend to flee the bright
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>And shun to gaze thereon; the sun even blinds,
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>If thou goest on to strain them unto him,
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>Because his strength is mighty, and the films
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>Heavily downward from on high are borne
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>Through the pure ether and the viewless winds,
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>And strike the eyes, disordering their joints.
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>So piecing lustre often burns the eyes,
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>Because it holdeth many seeds of fire
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>Which, working into eyes, engender pain.
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>Again, whatever jaundiced people view
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>Becomes wan-yellow, since from out their bodies
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>Flow many seeds wan-yellow forth to meet
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>The films of things, and many too are mixed
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>Within their eye, which by contagion paint
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>All things with sallowness. Again, we view
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>From dark recesses things that stand in light,
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>Because, when first has entered and possessed
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>The open eyes this nearer darkling air,
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>Swiftly the shining air and luminous
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>Followeth in, which purges then the eyes
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>And scatters asunder of that other air
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>The sable shadows, for in large degrees
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>This air is nimbler, nicer, and more strong.
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>And soon as ever 'thas filled and oped with light
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>The pathways of the eyeballs, which before
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>Black air had blocked, there follow straightaway
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>Those films of things out-standing in the light,
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>Provoking vision- what we cannot do
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>From out the light with objects in the dark,
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>Because that denser darkling air behind
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>Followeth in, and fills each aperture
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>And thus blockades the pathways of the eyes
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>That there no images of any things
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>Can be thrown in and agitate the eyes.
<A NAME="461"></A><BR><BR>And when from far away we do behold
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>The squared towers of a city, oft
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>Rounded they seem,- on this account because
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>Each distant angle is perceived obtuse,
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>Or rather it is not perceived at all;
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>And perishes its blow nor to our gaze
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>Arrives its stroke, since through such length of 
<A NAME="468"></A>air
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>Are borne along the idols that the air
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>Makes blunt the idol of the angle's point
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>By numerous collidings. When thuswise
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>The angles of the tower each and all
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>Have quite escaped the sense, the stones appear
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>As rubbed and rounded on a turner's wheel-
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>Yet not like objects near and truly round,
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>But with a semblance to them, shadowily.
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>Likewise, our shadow in the sun appears
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>To move along and follow our own steps
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>And imitate our carriage- if thou thinkest
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>Air that is thus bereft of light can walk,
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>Following the gait and motion of mankind.
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>For what we use to name a shadow, sure
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>Is naught but air deprived of light. No marvel:
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>Because the earth from spot to spot is reft
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>Progressively of light of sun, whenever
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>In moving round we get within its way,
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>While any spot of earth by us abandoned
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>Is filled with light again, on this account
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>It comes to pass that what was body's shadow
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>Seems still the same to follow after us
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>In one straight course. Since, evermore pour in
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>New lights of rays, and perish then the old,
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>Just like the wool that's drawn into the flame.
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>Therefore the earth is easily spoiled of light
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>And easily refilled and from herself
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>Washeth the black shadows quite away.
<A NAME="497"></A><BR><BR>And yet in this we don't at all concede
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>That eyes be cheated. For their task it is
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>To note in whatsoever place be light,
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>In what be shadow: whether or no the gleams
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>Be still the same, and whether the shadow which
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>Just now was here is that one passing thither,
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>Or whether the facts be what we said above,
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>'Tis after all the reasoning of mind
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>That must decide; nor can our eyeballs know
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>The nature of reality. And so
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>Attach thou not this fault of mind to eyes,
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>Nor lightly think our senses everywhere
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>Are tottering. The ship in which we sail
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>Is borne along, although it seems to stand;
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>The ship that bides in roadstead is supposed
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>There to be passing by. And hills and fields
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>Seem fleeing fast astern, past which we urge
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>The ship and fly under the bellying sails.
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>The stars, each one, do seem to pause, affixed
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>To the ethereal caverns, though they all
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>Forever are in motion, rising out
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>And thence revisiting their far descents
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>When they have measured with their bodies bright
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>The span of heaven. And likewise sun and moon
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>Seem biding in a roadstead,- objects which,
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>As plain fact proves, are really borne along.
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>Between two mountains far away aloft
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>From midst the whirl of waters open lies
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>A gaping exit for the fleet, and yet
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>They seem conjoined in a single isle.
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>When boys themselves have stopped their spinning 
<A NAME="528"></A>round,
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>The halls still seem to whirl and posts to reel,
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>Until they now must almost think the roofs
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>Threaten to ruin down upon their heads.
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>And now, when Nature begins to lift on high
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>The sun's red splendour and the tremulous fires,
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>And raise him o'er the mountain-tops, those mountains-
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>O'er which he seemeth then to thee to be,
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>His glowing self hard by atingeing them
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>With his own fire- are yet away from us
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>Scarcely two thousand arrow-shots, indeed
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>Oft scarce five hundred courses of a dart;
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>Although between those mountains and the sun
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>Lie the huge plains of ocean spread beneath
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>The vasty shores of ether, and intervene
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>A thousand lands, possessed by many a folk
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>And generations of wild beasts. Again,
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>A pool of water of but a finger's depth,
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>Which lies between the stones along the pave,
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>Offers a vision downward into earth
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>As far, as from the earth o'erspread on high
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>The gulfs of heaven; that thus thou seemest to view
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>Clouds down below and heavenly bodies plunged
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>Wondrously in heaven under earth.
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>Then too, when in the middle of the stream
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>Sticks fast our dashing horse, and down we gaze
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>Into the river's rapid waves, some force
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>Seems then to bear the body of the horse,
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>Though standing still, reversely from his course,
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>And swiftly push up-stream. And wheresoe'er
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>We cast our eyes across, all objects seem
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>Thus to be onward borne and flow along
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>In the same way as we. A portico,
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>Albeit it stands well propped from end to end
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>On equal columns, parallel and big,
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>Contracts by stages in a narrow cone,
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>When from one end the long, long whole is seen,-
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>Until, conjoining ceiling with the floor,
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>And the whole right side with the left, it draws
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>Together to a cone's nigh-viewless point.
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>To sailors on the main the sun he seems
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>From out the waves to rise, and in the waves
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>To set and bury his light- because indeed
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>They gaze on naught but water and the sky.
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>Again, to gazers ignorant of the sea,
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>Vessels in port seem, as with broken poops,
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>To lean upon the water, quite agog;
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>For any portion of the oars that's raised
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>Above the briny spray is straight, and straight
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>The rudders from above. But other parts,
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>Those sunk, immersed below the water-line,
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>Seem broken all and bended and inclined
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>Sloping to upwards, and turned back to float
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>Almost atop the water. And when the winds
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>Carry the scattered drifts along the sky
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>In the night-time, then seem to glide along
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>The radiant constellations 'gainst the clouds
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>And there on high to take far other course
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>From that whereon in truth they're borne. And then,
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>If haply our hand be set beneath one eye
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>And press below thereon, then to our gaze
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>Each object which we gaze on seems to be,
<A NAME="590"></A><BR>By some sensation twain- then twain the lights
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>Of lampions burgeoning in flowers of flame,
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>And twain the furniture in all the house,
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>Two-fold the visages of fellow-men,
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>And twain their bodies. And again, when sleep
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>Has bound our members down in slumber soft
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>And all the body lies in deep repose,
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>Yet then we seem to self to be awake
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>And move our members; and in night's blind gloom
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>We think to mark the daylight and the sun;
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>And, shut within a room, yet still we seem
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>To change our skies, our oceans, rivers, hills,
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>To cross the plains afoot, and hear new sounds,
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>Though still the austere silence of the night
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>Abides around us, and to speak replies,
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>Though voiceless. Other cases of the sort
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>Wondrously many do we see, which all
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>Seek, so to say, to injure faith in sense-
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>In vain, because the largest part of these
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>Deceives through mere opinions of the mind,
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>Which we do add ourselves, feigning to see
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>What by the senses are not seen at all.
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>For naught is harder than to separate
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>Plain facts from dubious, which the mind forthwith
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>Adds by itself.
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>Again, if one suppose
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>That naught is known, he knows not whether this
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>Itself is able to be known, since he
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>Confesses naught to know. Therefore with him
<A NAME="619"></A><BR>I waive discussion- who has set his head
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>Even where his feet should be. But let me grant
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>That this he knows,- I question: whence he knows
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>What 'tis to know and not-to-know in turn,
<A NAME="623"></A><BR>And what created concept of the truth,
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>And what device has proved the dubious
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>To differ from the certain?- since in things
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>He's heretofore seen naught of true. Thou'lt find
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>That from the senses first hath been create
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>Concept of truth, nor can the senses be
<A NAME="629"></A><BR><B>Rebutted.</B> For criterion must be found
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>Worthy of greater trust, which shall defeat
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>Through own authority the false by true;
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>What, then, than these our senses must there be
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>Worthy a greater trust? Shall reason, sprung
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>From some false sense, prevail to contradict
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>Those senses, sprung as reason wholly is
<A NAME="636"></A><BR>From out of the senses?- For lest these be true,
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>All reason also then is falsified.
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>Or shall the ears have power to blame the eyes,
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>Or yet the touch the ears? Again, shall taste
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>Accuse this touch or shall the nose confute
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>Or eyes defeat it? Methinks not so it is:
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>For unto each has been divided of
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>Its function quite apart, its power to each;
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>And thus we're still constrained to perceive
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>The soft, the cold, the hot apart, apart
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>All divers hues and whatso things there be
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>Conjoined with hues. Likewise the tasting tongue
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>Has its own power apart, and smells apart
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>And sounds apart are known. And thus it is
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>That no one sense can e'er convict another.
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>Nor shall one sense have power to blame itself,
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>Because it always must be deemed the same,
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>Worthy of equal trust. And therefore what
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>At any time unto these senses showed,
<A NAME="655"></A><BR>The same is true. And if the reason be
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>Unable to unravel us the cause
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>Why objects, which at hand were square, afar
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>Seemed rounded, yet it more availeth us,
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>Lacking the reason, to pretend a cause
<A NAME="660"></A><BR>For each configuration, than to let
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>From out our hands escape the obvious things
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>And injure primal faith in sense, and wreck
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>All those foundations upon which do rest
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>Our life and safety. For not only reason
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>Would topple down; but even our very life
<A NAME="666"></A><BR>Would straightaway collapse, unless we dared
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>To trust our senses and to keep away
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>From headlong heights and places to be shunned
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>Of a like peril, and to seek with speed
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>Their opposites! Again, as in a building,
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>If the first plumb-line be askew, and if
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>The square deceiving swerve from lines exact,
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>And if the level waver but the least
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>In any part, the whole construction then
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>Must turn out faulty- shelving and askew,
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>Leaning to back and front, incongruous,
<A NAME="677"></A><BR>That now some portions seem about to fall,
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>And falls the whole ere long- betrayed indeed
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>By first deceiving estimates: so too
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>Thy calculations in affairs of life
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>Must be askew and false, if sprung for thee
<A NAME="682"></A><BR>From senses false. So all that troop of words
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>Marshalled against the senses is quite vain.
<A NAME="684"></A><BR>And now remains to demonstrate with ease
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>How other senses each their things perceive.
<A NAME="686"></A><BR>Firstly, a sound and every voice is heard,
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>When, getting into ears, they strike the sense
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>With their own body. For confess we must
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>Even voice and sound to be corporeal,
<A NAME="690"></A><BR>Because they're able on the sense to strike.
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>Besides voice often scrapes against the throat,
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>And screams in going out do make more rough
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>The wind-pipe- naturally enough, methinks,
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>When, through the narrow exit rising up
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>In larger throng, these primal germs of voice
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>Have thus begun to issue forth. In sooth,
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>Also the door of the mouth is scraped against
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>By air blown outward from distended cheeks.
<A NAME="699"></A><BR><BR>And thus no doubt there is, that voice and words
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>Consist of elements corporeal,
<A NAME="701"></A><BR>With power to pain. Nor art thou unaware
<A NAME="702"></A><BR>Likewise how much of body's ta'en away,
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>How much from very thews and powers of men
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>May be withdrawn by steady talk, prolonged
<A NAME="705"></A><BR>Even from the rising splendour of the morn
<A NAME="706"></A><BR>To shadows of black evening,- above all
<A NAME="707"></A><BR>If 't be outpoured with most exceeding shouts.
<A NAME="708"></A><BR>Therefore the voice must be corporeal,
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>Since the long talker loses from his frame
<A NAME="710"></A><BR>A part.
<A NAME="711"></A><BR>Moreover, roughness in the sound
<A NAME="712"></A><BR>Comes from the roughness in the primal germs,
<A NAME="713"></A><BR>As a smooth sound from smooth ones is create;
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>Nor have these elements a form the same
<A NAME="715"></A><BR>When the trump rumbles with a hollow roar,
<A NAME="716"></A><BR>As when barbaric Berecynthian pipe
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>Buzzes with raucous boomings, or when swans
<A NAME="718"></A><BR>By night from icy shores of Helicon
<A NAME="719"></A><BR>With wailing voices raise their liquid dirge.
<A NAME="720"></A><BR><BR>Thus, when from deep within our frame we force
<A NAME="721"></A><BR>These voices, and at mouth expel them forth,
<A NAME="722"></A><BR>The mobile tongue, artificer of words,
<A NAME="723"></A><BR>Makes them articulate, and too the lips
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>By their formations share in shaping them.
<A NAME="725"></A><BR>Hence when the space is short from starting-point
<A NAME="726"></A><BR>To where that voice arrives, the very words
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>Must too be plainly heard, distinctly marked.
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>For then the voice conserves its own formation,
<A NAME="729"></A><BR>Conserves its shape. But if the space between
<A NAME="730"></A><BR>Be longer than is fit, the words must be
<A NAME="731"></A><BR>Through the much air confounded, and the voice
<A NAME="732"></A><BR>Disordered in its flight across the winds-
<A NAME="733"></A><BR>And so it haps, that thou canst sound perceive,
<A NAME="734"></A><BR>Yet not determine what the words may mean;
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>To such degree confounded and encumbered
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>The voice approaches us. Again, one word,
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>Sent from the crier's mouth, may rouse all ears
<A NAME="738"></A><BR>Among the populace. And thus one voice
<A NAME="739"></A><BR>Scatters asunder into many voices,
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>Since it divides itself for separate ears,
<A NAME="741"></A><BR>Imprinting form of word and a clear tone.
<A NAME="742"></A><BR>But whatso part of voices fails to hit
<A NAME="743"></A><BR>The ears themselves perishes, borne beyond,
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>Idly diffused among the winds. A part,
<A NAME="745"></A><BR>Beating on solid porticoes, tossed back
<A NAME="746"></A><BR>Returns a sound; and sometimes mocks the ear
<A NAME="747"></A><BR>With a mere phantom of a word. When this
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>Thou well hast noted, thou canst render count
<A NAME="749"></A><BR>Unto thyself and others why it is
<A NAME="750"></A><BR>Along the lonely places that the rocks
<A NAME="751"></A><BR>Give back like shapes of words in order like,
<A NAME="752"></A><BR>When search we after comrades wandering
<A NAME="753"></A><BR>Among the shady mountains, and aloud
<A NAME="754"></A><BR>Call unto them, the scattered. I have seen
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>Spots that gave back even voices six or seven
<A NAME="756"></A><BR>For one thrown forth- for so the very hills,
<A NAME="757"></A><BR>Dashing them back against the hills, kept on
<A NAME="758"></A><BR>With their reverberations. And these spots
<A NAME="759"></A><BR>The neighbouring country-side doth feign to be
<A NAME="760"></A><BR>Haunts of the goat-foot satyrs and the nymphs;
<A NAME="761"></A><BR>And tells ye there be fauns, by whose night noise
<A NAME="762"></A><BR>And antic revels yonder they declare
<A NAME="763"></A><BR>The voiceless silences are broken oft,
<A NAME="764"></A><BR>And tones of strings are made and wailings sweet
<A NAME="765"></A><BR>Which the pipe, beat by players' finger-tips,
<A NAME="766"></A><BR>Pours out; and far and wide the farmer-race
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>Begins to hear, when, shaking the garmentings
<A NAME="768"></A><BR>Of pine upon his half-beast head, god-Pan
<A NAME="769"></A><BR>With puckered lip oft runneth o'er and o'er
<A NAME="770"></A><BR>The open reeds,- lest flute should cease to pour
<A NAME="771"></A><BR>The woodland music! Other prodigies
<A NAME="772"></A><BR>And wonders of this ilk they love to tell,
<A NAME="773"></A><BR>Lest they be thought to dwell in lonely spots
<A NAME="774"></A><BR>And even by gods deserted. This is why
<A NAME="775"></A><BR>They boast of marvels in their story-tellings;
<A NAME="776"></A><BR>Or by some other reason are led on-
<A NAME="777"></A><BR>Greedy, as all mankind hath ever been,
<A NAME="778"></A><BR>To prattle fables into ears.
<A NAME="779"></A><BR>Again,
<A NAME="780"></A><BR>One need not wonder how it comes about
<A NAME="781"></A><BR>That through those places (through which eyes cannot
<A NAME="782"></A><BR>View objects manifest) sounds yet may pass
<A NAME="783"></A><BR>And assail the ears. For often we observe
<A NAME="784"></A><BR>People conversing, though the doors be closed;
<A NAME="785"></A><BR>No marvel either, since all voice unharmed
<A NAME="786"></A><BR>Can wind through bended apertures of things,
<A NAME="787"></A><BR>While idol-films decline to- for they're rent,
<A NAME="788"></A><BR>Unless along straight apertures they swim,
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>Like those in glass, through which all images
<A NAME="790"></A><BR>Do fly across. And yet this voice itself,
<A NAME="791"></A><BR>In passing through shut chambers of a house,
<A NAME="792"></A><BR>Is dulled, and in a jumble enters ears,
<A NAME="793"></A><BR>And sound we seem to hear far more than words.
<A NAME="794"></A><BR>Moreover, a voice is into all directions
<A NAME="795"></A><BR>Divided up, since off from one another
<A NAME="796"></A><BR>New voices are engendered, when one voice
<A NAME="797"></A><BR>Hath once leapt forth, outstarting into many-
<A NAME="798"></A><BR>As oft a spark of fire is wont to sprinkle
<A NAME="799"></A><BR>Itself into its several fires. And so,
<A NAME="800"></A><BR>Voices do fill those places hid behind,
<A NAME="801"></A><BR>Which all are in a hubbub round about,
<A NAME="802"></A><BR>Astir with sound. But idol-films do tend,
<A NAME="803"></A><BR>As once set forth, in straight directions all;
<A NAME="804"></A><BR>Wherefore one can inside a wall see naught,
<A NAME="805"></A><BR>Yet catch the voices from beyond the same.
<A NAME="806"></A><BR><BR>Nor tongue and palate, whereby we flavour feel,
<A NAME="807"></A><BR>Present more problems for more work of thought.
<A NAME="808"></A><BR>Firstly, we feel a flavour in the mouth,
<A NAME="809"></A><BR>When forth we squeeze it, in chewing up our food,-
<A NAME="810"></A><BR>As any one perchance begins to squeeze
<A NAME="811"></A><BR>With hand and dry a sponge with water soaked.
<A NAME="812"></A><BR>Next, all which forth we squeeze is spread about
<A NAME="813"></A><BR>Along the pores and intertwined paths
<A NAME="814"></A><BR>Of the loose-textured tongue. And so, when smooth
<A NAME="815"></A><BR>The bodies of the oozy flavour, then
<A NAME="816"></A><BR>Delightfully they touch, delightfully
<A NAME="817"></A><BR>They treat all spots, around the wet and trickling
<A NAME="818"></A><BR>Enclosures of the tongue. And contrariwise,
<A NAME="819"></A><BR>They sting and pain the sense with their assault,
<A NAME="820"></A><BR>According as with roughness they're supplied.
<A NAME="821"></A><BR>Next, only up to palate is the pleasure
<A NAME="822"></A><BR>Coming from flavour; for in truth when down
<A NAME="823"></A><BR>'Thas plunged along the throat, no pleasure is,
<A NAME="824"></A><BR>Whilst into all the frame it spreads around;
<A NAME="825"></A><BR>Nor aught it matters with what food is fed
<A NAME="826"></A><BR>The body, if only what thou take thou canst
<A NAME="827"></A><BR>Distribute well digested to the frame
<A NAME="828"></A><BR>And keep the stomach in a moist career.
<A NAME="829"></A><BR>Now, how it is we see some food for some,
<A NAME="830"></A><BR>Others for others....
<A NAME="831"></A><BR><BR>I will unfold, or wherefore what to some
<A NAME="832"></A><BR>Is foul and bitter, yet the same to others
<A NAME="833"></A><BR>Can seem delectable to eat,- why here
<A NAME="834"></A><BR>So great the distance and the difference is
<A NAME="835"></A><BR>That what is food to one to some becomes
<A NAME="836"></A><BR>Fierce poison, as a certain snake there is
<A NAME="837"></A><BR>Which, touched by spittle of a man, will waste
<A NAME="838"></A><BR>And end itself by gnawing up its coil.
<A NAME="839"></A><BR>Again, fierce poison is the hellebore
<A NAME="840"></A><BR>To us, but puts the fat on goats and quails.
<A NAME="841"></A><BR>That thou mayst know by what devices this
<A NAME="842"></A><BR>Is brought about, in chief thou must recall
<A NAME="843"></A><BR>What we have said before, that seeds are kept
<A NAME="844"></A><BR>Commixed in things in divers modes. Again,
<A NAME="845"></A><BR>As all the breathing creatures which take food
<A NAME="846"></A><BR>Are outwardly unlike, and outer cut
<A NAME="847"></A><BR>And contour of their members bounds them round,
<A NAME="848"></A><BR>Each differing kind by kind, they thus consist
<A NAME="849"></A><BR>Of seeds of varying shape. And furthermore,
<A NAME="850"></A><BR>Since seeds do differ, divers too must be
<A NAME="851"></A><BR>The interstices and paths (which we do call
<A NAME="852"></A><BR>The apertures) in all the members, even
<A NAME="853"></A><BR>In mouth and palate too. Thus some must be
<A NAME="854"></A><BR>More small or yet more large, three-cornered some
<A NAME="855"></A><BR>And others squared, and many others round,
<A NAME="856"></A><BR>And certain of them many-angled too
<A NAME="857"></A><BR>In many modes. For, as the combination
<A NAME="858"></A><BR>And motion of their divers shapes demand,
<A NAME="859"></A><BR>The shapes of apertures must be diverse
<A NAME="860"></A><BR>And paths must vary according to their walls
<A NAME="861"></A><BR>That bound them. Hence when what is sweet to some,
<A NAME="862"></A><BR>Becomes to others bitter, for him to whom
<A NAME="863"></A><BR>'Tis sweet, the smoothest particles must needs
<A NAME="864"></A><BR>Have entered caressingly the palate's pores.
<A NAME="865"></A><BR>And, contrariwise, with those to whom that sweet
<A NAME="866"></A><BR>Is sour within the mouth, beyond a doubt
<A NAME="867"></A><BR>The rough and barbed particles have got
<A NAME="868"></A><BR>Into the narrows of the apertures.
<A NAME="869"></A><BR>Now easy it is from these affairs to know
<A NAME="870"></A><BR>Whatever...
<A NAME="871"></A><BR><BR>Indeed, where one from o'er-abundant bile
<A NAME="872"></A><BR>Is stricken with fever, or in other wise
<A NAME="873"></A><BR>Feels the roused violence of some malady,
<A NAME="874"></A><BR>There the whole frame is now upset, and there
<A NAME="875"></A><BR>All the positions of the seeds are changed,-
<A NAME="876"></A><BR>So that the bodies which before were fit
<A NAME="877"></A><BR>To cause the savour, now are fit no more,
<A NAME="878"></A><BR>And now more apt are others which be able
<A NAME="879"></A><BR>To get within the pores and gender sour.
<A NAME="880"></A><BR>Both sorts, in sooth, are intermixed in honey-
<A NAME="881"></A><BR>What oft we've proved above to thee before.
<A NAME="882"></A><BR>Now come, and I will indicate what wise
<A NAME="883"></A><BR>Impact of odour on the nostrils touches.
<A NAME="884"></A><BR>And first, 'tis needful there be many things
<A NAME="885"></A><BR>From whence the streaming flow of varied odours
<A NAME="886"></A><BR>May roll along, and we're constrained to think
<A NAME="887"></A><BR>They stream and dart and sprinkle themselves about
<A NAME="888"></A><BR><B>Impartially.</B> But for some breathing creatures
<A NAME="889"></A><BR>One odour is more apt, to others another-
<A NAME="890"></A><BR>Because of differing forms of seeds and pores.
<A NAME="891"></A><BR>Thus on and on along the zephyrs bees
<A NAME="892"></A><BR>Are led by odour of honey, vultures too
<A NAME="893"></A><BR>By carcasses. Again, the forward power
<A NAME="894"></A><BR>Of scent in dogs doth lead the hunter on
<A NAME="895"></A><BR>Whithersoever the splay-foot of wild beast
<A NAME="896"></A><BR>Hath hastened its career; and the white goose,
<A NAME="897"></A><BR>The saviour of the Roman citadel,
<A NAME="898"></A><BR>Forescents afar the odour of mankind.
<A NAME="899"></A><BR>Thus, diversely to divers ones is given
<A NAME="900"></A><BR>Peculiar smell that leadeth each along
<A NAME="901"></A><BR>To his own food or makes him start aback
<A NAME="902"></A><BR>From loathsome poison, and in this wise are
<A NAME="903"></A><BR>The generations of the wild preserved.
<A NAME="904"></A><BR><BR>Yet is this pungence not alone in odours
<A NAME="905"></A><BR>Or in the class of flavours; but, likewise,
<A NAME="906"></A><BR>The look of things and hues agree not all
<A NAME="907"></A><BR>So well with senses unto all, but that
<A NAME="908"></A><BR>Some unto some will be, to gaze upon,
<A NAME="909"></A><BR>More keen and painful. Lo, the raving lions,
<A NAME="910"></A><BR>They dare not face and gaze upon the cock
<A NAME="911"></A><BR>Who's wont with wings to flap away the night
<A NAME="912"></A><BR>From off the stage, and call the beaming morn
<A NAME="913"></A><BR>With clarion voice- and lions straightway thus
<A NAME="914"></A><BR>Bethink themselves of flight, because, ye see,
<A NAME="915"></A><BR>Within the body of the cocks there be
<A NAME="916"></A><BR>Some certain seeds, which, into lions' eyes
<A NAME="917"></A><BR>Injected, bore into the pupils deep
<A NAME="918"></A><BR>And yield such piercing pain they can't hold out
<A NAME="919"></A><BR>Against the cocks, however fierce they be-
<A NAME="920"></A><BR>Whilst yet these seeds can't hurt our gaze the least,
<A NAME="921"></A><BR>Either because they do not penetrate,
<A NAME="922"></A><BR>Or since they have free exit from the eyes
<A NAME="923"></A><BR>As soon as penetrating, so that thus
<A NAME="924"></A><BR>They cannot hurt our eyes in any part
<A NAME="925"></A><BR>By there remaining.
<A NAME="926"></A><BR>To speak once more of odour;
<A NAME="927"></A><BR>Whatever assail the nostrils, some can travel
<A NAME="928"></A><BR>A longer way than others. None of them,
<A NAME="929"></A><BR>However, 's borne so far as sound or voice-
<A NAME="930"></A><BR>While I omit all mention of such things
<A NAME="931"></A><BR>As hit the eyesight and assail the vision.
<A NAME="932"></A><BR>For slowly on a wandering course it comes
<A NAME="933"></A><BR>And perishes sooner, by degrees absorbed
<A NAME="934"></A><BR>Easily into all the winds of air;
<A NAME="935"></A><BR>And first, because from deep inside the thing
<A NAME="936"></A><BR>It is discharged with labour (for the fact
<A NAME="937"></A><BR>That every object, when 'tis shivered, ground,
<A NAME="938"></A><BR>Or crumbled by the fire, will smell the stronger
<A NAME="939"></A><BR>Is sign that odours flow and part away
<A NAME="940"></A><BR>From inner regions of the things). And next,
<A NAME="941"></A><BR>Thou mayest see that odour is create
<A NAME="942"></A><BR>Of larger primal germs than voice, because
<A NAME="943"></A><BR>It enters not through stony walls, wherethrough
<A NAME="944"></A><BR>Unfailingly the voice and sound are borne;
<A NAME="945"></A><BR>Wherefore, besides, thou wilt observe 'tis not
<A NAME="946"></A><BR>So easy to trace out in whatso place
<A NAME="947"></A><BR>The smelling object is. For, dallying on
<A NAME="948"></A><BR>Along the winds, the particles cool off,
<A NAME="949"></A><BR>And then the scurrying messengers of things
<A NAME="950"></A><BR>Arrive our senses, when no longer hot.
<A NAME="951"></A><BR>So dogs oft wander astray, and hunt the scent.
<A NAME="952"></A><BR><BR>Now mark, and hear what objects move the mind,
<A NAME="953"></A><BR>And learn, in few, whence unto intellect
<A NAME="954"></A><BR>Do come what come. And first I tell thee this:
<A NAME="955"></A><BR>That many images of objects rove
<A NAME="956"></A><BR>In many modes to every region round-
<A NAME="957"></A><BR>So thin that easily the one with other,
<A NAME="958"></A><BR>When once they meet, uniteth in mid-air,
<A NAME="959"></A><BR>Like gossamer or gold-leaf. For, indeed,
<A NAME="960"></A><BR>Far thinner are they in their fabric than
<A NAME="961"></A><BR>Those images which take a hold on eyes
<A NAME="962"></A><BR>And smite the vision, since through body's pores
<A NAME="963"></A><BR>They penetrate, and inwardly stir up
<A NAME="964"></A><BR>The subtle nature of mind and smite the sense.
<A NAME="965"></A><BR>Thus, Centaurs and the limbs of Scyllas, thus
<A NAME="966"></A><BR>The Cerberus-visages of dogs we see,
<A NAME="967"></A><BR>And images of people gone before-
<A NAME="968"></A><BR>Dead men whose bones earth bosomed long ago;
<A NAME="969"></A><BR>Because the images of every kind
<A NAME="970"></A><BR>Are everywhere about us borne- in part
<A NAME="971"></A><BR>Those which are gendered in the very air
<A NAME="972"></A><BR>Of own accord, in part those others which
<A NAME="973"></A><BR>From divers things do part away, and those
<A NAME="974"></A><BR>Which are compounded, made from out their shapes.
<A NAME="975"></A><BR>For soothly from no living Centaur is
<A NAME="976"></A><BR>That phantom gendered, since no breed of beast
<A NAME="977"></A><BR>Like him was ever; but, when images
<A NAME="978"></A><BR>Of horse and man by chance have come together,
<A NAME="979"></A><BR>They easily cohere, as aforesaid,
<A NAME="980"></A><BR>At once, through subtle nature and fabric thin.
<A NAME="981"></A><BR>In the same fashion others of this ilk
<A NAME="982"></A><BR>Created are. And when they're quickly borne
<A NAME="983"></A><BR>In their exceeding lightness, easily
<A NAME="984"></A><BR>(As earlier I showed) one subtle image,
<A NAME="985"></A><BR>Compounded, moves by its one blow the mind,
<A NAME="986"></A><BR>Itself so subtle and so strangely quick.
<A NAME="987"></A><BR><BR>That these things come to pass as I record,
<A NAME="988"></A><BR>From this thou easily canst understand:
<A NAME="989"></A><BR>So far as one is unto other like,
<A NAME="990"></A><BR>Seeing with mind as well as with the eyes
<A NAME="991"></A><BR>Must come to pass in fashion not unlike.
<A NAME="992"></A><BR>Well, now, since I have shown that I perceive
<A NAME="993"></A><BR>Haply a lion through those idol-films
<A NAME="994"></A><BR>Such as assail my eyes, 'tis thine to know
<A NAME="995"></A><BR>Also the mind is in like manner moved,
<A NAME="996"></A><BR>And sees, nor more nor less than eyes do see
<A NAME="997"></A><BR>(Except that it perceives more subtle films)
<A NAME="998"></A><BR>The lion and aught else through idol-films.
<A NAME="999"></A><BR>And when the sleep has overset our frame,
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR>The mind's intelligence is now awake,
<A NAME="1001"></A><BR>Still for no other reason, save that these-
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR>The self-same films as when we are awake-
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR>Assail our minds, to such degree indeed
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR>That we do seem to see for sure the man
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR>Whom, void of life, now death and earth have gained
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR>Dominion over. And Nature forces this
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR>To come to pass because the body's senses
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR>Are resting, thwarted through the members all,
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR>Unable now to conquer false with true;
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR>And memory lies prone and languishes
<A NAME="1011"></A><BR>In slumber, nor protests that he, the man
<A NAME="1012"></A><BR>Whom the mind feigns to see alive, long since
<A NAME="1013"></A><BR>Hath been the gain of death and dissolution.
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR><BR>And further, 'tis no marvel idols move
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR>And toss their arms and other members round
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR>In rhythmic time- and often in men's sleeps
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR>It haps an image this is seen to do;
<A NAME="1018"></A><BR>In sooth, when perishes the former image,
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR>And other is gendered of another pose,
<A NAME="1020"></A><BR>That former seemeth to have changed its gestures.
<A NAME="1021"></A><BR>Of course the change must be conceived as speedy;
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR>So great the swiftness and so great the store
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR>Of idol-things, and (in an instant brief
<A NAME="1024"></A><BR>As mind can mark) so great, again, the store
<A NAME="1025"></A><BR>Of separate idol-parts to bring supplies.
<A NAME="1026"></A><BR><BR>It happens also that there is supplied
<A NAME="1027"></A><BR>Sometimes an image not of kind the same;
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR>But what before was woman, now at hand
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR>Is seen to stand there, altered into male;
<A NAME="1030"></A><BR>Or other visage, other age succeeds;
<A NAME="1031"></A><BR>But slumber and oblivion take care
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR>That we shall feel no wonder at the thing.
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR><BR>And much in these affairs demands inquiry,
<A NAME="1034"></A><BR>And much, illumination- if we crave
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR>With plainness to exhibit facts. And first,
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR>Why doth the mind of one to whom the whim
<A NAME="1037"></A><BR>To think has come behold forthwith that thing?
<A NAME="1038"></A><BR>Or do the idols watch upon our will,
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR>And doth an image unto us occur,
<A NAME="1040"></A><BR>Directly we desire- if heart prefer
<A NAME="1041"></A><BR>The sea, the land, or after all the sky?
<A NAME="1042"></A><BR>Assemblies of the citizens, parades,
<A NAME="1043"></A><BR>Banquets, and battles, these and all doth she,
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR>Nature, create and furnish at our word?
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR>Maugre the fact that in same place and spot
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR>Another's mind is meditating things
<A NAME="1047"></A><BR>All far unlike. And what, again, of this:
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR>When we in sleep behold the idols step,
<A NAME="1049"></A><BR>In measure, forward, moving supple limbs,
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR>Whilst forth they put each supple arm in turn
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR>With speedy motion, and with eyeing heads
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR>Repeat the movement, as the foot keeps time?
<A NAME="1053"></A><BR>Forsooth, the idols they are steeped in art,
<A NAME="1054"></A><BR>And wander to and fro well taught indeed,-
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR>Thus to be able in the time of night
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR>To make such games! Or will the truth be this:
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR>Because in one least moment that we mark-
<A NAME="1058"></A><BR>That is, the uttering of a single sound-
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR>There lurk yet many moments, which the reason
<A NAME="1060"></A><BR>Discovers to exist, therefore it comes
<A NAME="1061"></A><BR>That, in a moment how so brief ye will,
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR>The divers idols are hard by, and ready
<A NAME="1063"></A><BR>Each in its place diverse? So great the swiftness,
<A NAME="1064"></A><BR>So great, again, the store of idol-things,
<A NAME="1065"></A><BR>And so, when perishes the former image,
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR>And other is gendered of another pose,
<A NAME="1067"></A><BR>The former seemeth to have changed its gestures.
<A NAME="1068"></A><BR>And since they be so tenuous, mind can mark
<A NAME="1069"></A><BR>Sharply alone the ones it strains to see;
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR>And thus the rest do perish one and all,
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR>Save those for which the mind prepares itself.
<A NAME="1072"></A><BR>Further, it doth prepare itself indeed,
<A NAME="1073"></A><BR>And hopes to see what follows after each-
<A NAME="1074"></A><BR>Hence this result. For hast thou not observed
<A NAME="1075"></A><BR>How eyes, essaying to perceive the fine,
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR>Will strain in preparation, otherwise
<A NAME="1077"></A><BR>Unable sharply to perceive at all?
<A NAME="1078"></A><BR>Yet know thou canst that, even in objects plain,
<A NAME="1079"></A><BR>If thou attendest not, 'tis just the same
<A NAME="1080"></A><BR>As if 'twere all the time removed and far.
<A NAME="1081"></A><BR>What marvel, then, that mind doth lose the rest,
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR>Save those to which 'thas given up itself?
<A NAME="1083"></A><BR>So 'tis that we conjecture from small signs
<A NAME="1084"></A><BR>Things wide and weighty, and involve ourselves
<A NAME="1085"></A><BR>In snarls of self-deceit.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1086"></A><B>Some Vital Functions</B>

<A NAME="1087"></A><BR><BR>In these affairs
<A NAME="1088"></A><BR>We crave that thou wilt passionately flee
<A NAME="1089"></A><BR>The one offence, and anxiously wilt shun
<A NAME="1090"></A><BR>The error of presuming the clear lights
<A NAME="1091"></A><BR>Of eyes created were that we might see;
<A NAME="1092"></A><BR>Or thighs and knees, aprop upon the feet,
<A NAME="1093"></A><BR>Thuswise can bended be, that we might step
<A NAME="1094"></A><BR>With goodly strides ahead; or forearms joined
<A NAME="1095"></A><BR>Unto the sturdy uppers, or serving hands
<A NAME="1096"></A><BR>On either side were given, that we might do
<A NAME="1097"></A><BR>Life's own demands. All such interpretation
<A NAME="1098"></A><BR>Is aft-for-fore with inverse reasoning,
<A NAME="1099"></A><BR>Since naught is born in body so that we
<A NAME="1100"></A><BR>May use the same, but birth engenders use:
<A NAME="1101"></A><BR>No seeing ere the lights of eyes were born,
<A NAME="1102"></A><BR>No speaking ere the tongue created was;
<A NAME="1103"></A><BR>But origin of tongue came long before
<A NAME="1104"></A><BR>Discourse of words, and ears created were
<A NAME="1105"></A><BR>Much earlier than any sound was heard;
<A NAME="1106"></A><BR>And all the members, so meseems, were there
<A NAME="1107"></A><BR>Before they got their use: and therefore, they
<A NAME="1108"></A><BR>Could not be gendered for the sake of use.
<A NAME="1109"></A><BR>But contrariwise, contending in the fight
<A NAME="1110"></A><BR>With hand to hand, and rending of the joints,
<A NAME="1111"></A><BR>And fouling of the limbs with gore, was there,
<A NAME="1112"></A><BR>O long before the gleaming spears ere flew;
<A NAME="1113"></A><BR>And Nature prompted man to shun a wound,
<A NAME="1114"></A><BR>Before the left arm by the aid of art
<A NAME="1115"></A><BR>Opposed the shielding targe. And, verily,
<A NAME="1116"></A><BR>Yielding the weary body to repose,
<A NAME="1117"></A><BR>Far ancienter than cushions of soft beds,
<A NAME="1118"></A><BR>And quenching thirst is earlier than cups.
<A NAME="1119"></A><BR>These objects, therefore, which for use and life
<A NAME="1120"></A><BR>Have been devised, can be conceived as found
<A NAME="1121"></A><BR>For sake of using. But apart from such
<A NAME="1122"></A><BR>Are all which first were born and afterwards
<A NAME="1123"></A><BR>Gave knowledge of their own utility-
<A NAME="1124"></A><BR>Chief in which sort we note the senses, limbs:
<A NAME="1125"></A><BR>Wherefore, again, 'tis quite beyond thy power
<A NAME="1126"></A><BR>To hold that these could thus have been create
<A NAME="1127"></A><BR>For office of utility.
<A NAME="1128"></A><BR>Likewise,
<A NAME="1129"></A><BR>'Tis nothing strange that all the breathing creatures
<A NAME="1130"></A><BR>Seek, even by nature of their frame, their food.
<A NAME="1131"></A><BR>Yes, since I've taught thee that from off the things
<A NAME="1132"></A><BR>Stream and depart innumerable bodies
<A NAME="1133"></A><BR>In modes innumerable too; but most
<A NAME="1134"></A><BR>Must be the bodies streaming from the living-
<A NAME="1135"></A><BR>Which bodies, vexed by motion evermore,
<A NAME="1136"></A><BR>Are through the mouth exhaled innumerable,
<A NAME="1137"></A><BR>When weary creatures pant, or through the sweat
<A NAME="1138"></A><BR>Squeezed forth innumerable from deep within.
<A NAME="1139"></A><BR>Thus body rarefies, so undermined
<A NAME="1140"></A><BR>In all its nature, and pain attends its state.
<A NAME="1141"></A><BR>And so the food is taken to underprop
<A NAME="1142"></A><BR>The tottering joints, and by its interfusion
<A NAME="1143"></A><BR>To re-create their powers, and there stop up
<A NAME="1144"></A><BR>The longing, open-mouthed through limbs and veins,
<A NAME="1145"></A><BR>For eating. And the moist no less departs
<A NAME="1146"></A><BR>Into all regions that demand the moist;
<A NAME="1147"></A><BR>And many heaped-up particles of hot,
<A NAME="1148"></A><BR>Which cause such burnings in these bellies of ours,
<A NAME="1149"></A><BR>The liquid on arriving dissipates
<A NAME="1150"></A><BR>And quenches like a fire, that parching heat
<A NAME="1151"></A><BR>No longer now can scorch the frame. And so,
<A NAME="1152"></A><BR>Thou seest how panting thirst is washed away
<A NAME="1153"></A><BR>From off our body, how the hunger-pang
<A NAME="1154"></A><BR>It, too, appeased.
<A NAME="1155"></A><BR>Now, how it comes that we,
<A NAME="1156"></A><BR>Whene'er we wish, can step with strides ahead,
<A NAME="1157"></A><BR>And how 'tis given to move our limbs about,
<A NAME="1158"></A><BR>And what device is wont to push ahead
<A NAME="1159"></A><BR>This the big load of our corporeal frame,
<A NAME="1160"></A><BR>I'll say to thee- do thou attend what's said.
<A NAME="1161"></A><BR>I say that first some idol-films of walking
<A NAME="1162"></A><BR>Into our mind do fall and smite the mind,
<A NAME="1163"></A><BR>As said before. Thereafter will arises;
<A NAME="1164"></A><BR>For no one starts to do a thing, before
<A NAME="1165"></A><BR>The intellect previsions what it wills;
<A NAME="1166"></A><BR>And what it there pre-visioneth depends
<A NAME="1167"></A><BR>On what that image is. When, therefore, mind
<A NAME="1168"></A><BR>Doth so bestir itself that it doth will
<A NAME="1169"></A><BR>To go and step along, it strikes at once
<A NAME="1170"></A><BR>That energy of soul that's sown about
<A NAME="1171"></A><BR>In all the body through the limbs and frame-
<A NAME="1172"></A><BR>And this is easy of performance, since
<A NAME="1173"></A><BR>The soul is close conjoined with the mind.
<A NAME="1174"></A><BR>Next, soul in turn strikes body, and by degrees
<A NAME="1175"></A><BR>Thus the whole mass is pushed along and moved.
<A NAME="1176"></A><BR>Then too the body rarefies, and air,
<A NAME="1177"></A><BR>Forsooth as ever of such nimbleness,
<A NAME="1178"></A><BR>Comes on and penetrates aboundingly
<A NAME="1179"></A><BR>Through opened pores, and thus is sprinkled round
<A NAME="1180"></A><BR>Unto all smallest places in our frame.
<A NAME="1181"></A><BR>Thus then by these twain factors, severally,
<A NAME="1182"></A><BR>Body is borne like ship with oars and wind.
<A NAME="1183"></A><BR>Nor yet in these affairs is aught for wonder
<A NAME="1184"></A><BR>That particles so fine can whirl around
<A NAME="1185"></A><BR>So great a body and turn this weight of ours;
<A NAME="1186"></A><BR>For wind, so tenuous with its subtle body,
<A NAME="1187"></A><BR>Yet pushes, driving on the mighty ship
<A NAME="1188"></A><BR>Of mighty bulk; one hand directs the same,
<A NAME="1189"></A><BR>Whatever its momentum, and one helm
<A NAME="1190"></A><BR>Whirls it around, whither ye please; and loads,
<A NAME="1191"></A><BR>Many and huge, are moved and hoisted high
<A NAME="1192"></A><BR>By enginery of pulley-blocks and wheels,
<A NAME="1193"></A><BR>With but light strain.
<A NAME="1194"></A><BR>Now, by what modes this sleep
<A NAME="1195"></A><BR>Pours through our members waters of repose
<A NAME="1196"></A><BR>And frees the breast from cares of mind, I'll tell
<A NAME="1197"></A><BR>In verses sweeter than they many are;
<A NAME="1198"></A><BR>Even as the swan's slight note is better far
<A NAME="1199"></A><BR>Than that dispersed clamour of the cranes
<A NAME="1200"></A><BR>Among the south wind's aery clouds. Do thou
<A NAME="1201"></A><BR>Give me sharp ears and a sagacious mind,-
<A NAME="1202"></A><BR>That thou mayst not deny the things to be
<A NAME="1203"></A><BR>Whereof I'm speaking, nor depart away
<A NAME="1204"></A><BR>With bosom scorning these the spoken truths,
<A NAME="1205"></A><BR>Thyself at fault unable to perceive.
<A NAME="1206"></A><BR>Sleep chiefly comes when energy of soul
<A NAME="1207"></A><BR>Hath now been scattered through the frame, and part
<A NAME="1208"></A><BR>Expelled abroad and gone away, and part
<A NAME="1209"></A><BR>Crammed back and settling deep within the frame-
<A NAME="1210"></A><BR>Whereafter then our loosened members droop.
<A NAME="1211"></A><BR>For doubt is none that by the work of soul
<A NAME="1212"></A><BR>Exist in us this sense, and when by slumber
<A NAME="1213"></A><BR>That sense is thwarted, we are bound to think
<A NAME="1214"></A><BR>The soul confounded and expelled abroad-
<A NAME="1215"></A><BR>Yet not entirely, else the frame would lie
<A NAME="1216"></A><BR>Drenched in the everlasting cold of death.
<A NAME="1217"></A><BR>In sooth, where no one part of soul remained
<A NAME="1218"></A><BR>Lurking among the members, even as fire
<A NAME="1219"></A><BR>Lurks buried under many ashes, whence
<A NAME="1220"></A><BR>Could sense amain rekindled be in members,
<A NAME="1221"></A><BR>As flame can rise anew from unseen fire?
<A NAME="1222"></A><BR><BR>By what devices this strange state and new
<A NAME="1223"></A><BR>May be occasioned, and by what the soul
<A NAME="1224"></A><BR>Can be confounded and the frame grow faint,
<A NAME="1225"></A><BR>I will untangle: see to it, thou, that I
<A NAME="1226"></A><BR>Pour forth my words not unto empty winds.
<A NAME="1227"></A><BR>In first place, body on its outer parts-
<A NAME="1228"></A><BR>Since these are touched by neighbouring aery gusts-
<A NAME="1229"></A><BR>Must there be thumped and strook by blows of air
<A NAME="1230"></A><BR><B>Repeatedly.</B> And therefore almost all
<A NAME="1231"></A><BR>Are covered either with hides, or else with shells,
<A NAME="1232"></A><BR>Or with the horny callus, or with bark.
<A NAME="1233"></A><BR>Yet this same air lashes their inner parts,
<A NAME="1234"></A><BR>When creatures draw a breath or blow it out.
<A NAME="1235"></A><BR>Wherefore, since body thus is flogged alike
<A NAME="1236"></A><BR>Upon the inside and the out, and blows
<A NAME="1237"></A><BR>Come in upon us through the little pores
<A NAME="1238"></A><BR>Even inward to our body's primal parts
<A NAME="1239"></A><BR>And primal elements, there comes to pass
<A NAME="1240"></A><BR>By slow degrees, along our members then,
<A NAME="1241"></A><BR>A kind of overthrow; for then confounded
<A NAME="1242"></A><BR>Are those arrangements of the primal germs
<A NAME="1243"></A><BR>Of body and of mind. It comes to pass
<A NAME="1244"></A><BR>That next a part of soul's expelled abroad,
<A NAME="1245"></A><BR>A part retreateth in recesses hid,
<A NAME="1246"></A><BR>A part, too, scattered all about the frame,
<A NAME="1247"></A><BR>Cannot become united nor engage
<A NAME="1248"></A><BR>In interchange of motion. Nature now
<A NAME="1249"></A><BR>So hedges off approaches and the paths;
<A NAME="1250"></A><BR>And thus the sense, its motions all deranged,
<A NAME="1251"></A><BR>Retires down deep within; and since there's naught,
<A NAME="1252"></A><BR>As 'twere, to prop the frame, the body weakens,
<A NAME="1253"></A><BR>And all the members languish, and the arms
<A NAME="1254"></A><BR>And eyelids fall, and, as ye lie abed,
<A NAME="1255"></A><BR>Even there the houghs will sag and loose their powers.
<A NAME="1256"></A><BR>Again, sleep follows after food, because
<A NAME="1257"></A><BR>The food produces same result as air,
<A NAME="1258"></A><BR>Whilst being scattered round through all the veins;
<A NAME="1259"></A><BR>And much the heaviest is that slumber which,
<A NAME="1260"></A><BR>Full or fatigued, thou takest; since 'tis then
<A NAME="1261"></A><BR>That the most bodies disarrange themselves,
<A NAME="1262"></A><BR>Bruised by labours hard. And in same wise,
<A NAME="1263"></A><BR>This three-fold change: a forcing of the soul
<A NAME="1264"></A><BR>Down deeper, more a casting-forth of it,
<A NAME="1265"></A><BR>A moving more divided in its parts
<A NAME="1266"></A><BR>And scattered more.
<A NAME="1267"></A><BR>And to whate'er pursuit
<A NAME="1268"></A><BR>A man most clings absorbed, or what the affairs
<A NAME="1269"></A><BR>On which we theretofore have tarried much,
<A NAME="1270"></A><BR>And mind hath strained upon the more, we seem
<A NAME="1271"></A><BR>In sleep not rarely to go at the same.
<A NAME="1272"></A><BR>The lawyers seem to plead and cite decrees,
<A NAME="1273"></A><BR>Commanders they to fight and go at frays,
<A NAME="1274"></A><BR>Sailors to live in combat with the winds,
<A NAME="1275"></A><BR>And we ourselves indeed to make this book,
<A NAME="1276"></A><BR>And still to seek the nature of the world
<A NAME="1277"></A><BR>And set it down, when once discovered, here
<A NAME="1278"></A><BR>In these my country's leaves. Thus all pursuits,
<A NAME="1279"></A><BR>All arts in general seem in sleeps to mock
<A NAME="1280"></A><BR>And master the minds of men. And whosoever
<A NAME="1281"></A><BR>Day after day for long to games have given
<A NAME="1282"></A><BR>Attention undivided, still they keep
<A NAME="1283"></A><BR>(As oft we note), even when they've ceased to grasp
<A NAME="1284"></A><BR>Those games with their own senses, open paths
<A NAME="1285"></A><BR>Within the mind wherethrough the idol-films
<A NAME="1286"></A><BR>Of just those games can come. And thus it is
<A NAME="1287"></A><BR>For many a day thereafter those appear
<A NAME="1288"></A><BR>Floating before the eyes, that even awake
<A NAME="1289"></A><BR>They think they view the dancers moving round
<A NAME="1290"></A><BR>Their supple limbs, and catch with both the ears
<A NAME="1291"></A><BR>The liquid song of harp and speaking chords,
<A NAME="1292"></A><BR>And view the same assembly on the seats,
<A NAME="1293"></A><BR>And manifold bright glories of the stage-
<A NAME="1294"></A><BR>So great the influence of pursuit and zest,
<A NAME="1295"></A><BR>And of the affairs wherein 'thas been the wont
<A NAME="1296"></A><BR>Of men to be engaged-nor only men,
<A NAME="1297"></A><BR>But soothly all the animals. Behold,
<A NAME="1298"></A><BR>Thou'lt see the sturdy horses, though outstretched,
<A NAME="1299"></A><BR>Yet sweating in their sleep, and panting ever,
<A NAME="1300"></A><BR>And straining utmost strength, as if for prize,
<A NAME="1301"></A><BR>As if, with barriers opened now...
<A NAME="1302"></A><BR>And hounds of huntsmen oft in soft repose
<A NAME="1303"></A><BR>Yet toss asudden all their legs about,
<A NAME="1304"></A><BR>And growl and bark, and with their nostrils sniff
<A NAME="1305"></A><BR>The winds again, again, though indeed
<A NAME="1306"></A><BR>They'd caught the scented foot-prints of wild beasts,
<A NAME="1307"></A><BR>And, even when wakened, often they pursue
<A NAME="1308"></A><BR>The phantom images of stags, as though
<A NAME="1309"></A><BR>They did perceive them fleeing on before,
<A NAME="1310"></A><BR>Until the illusion's shaken off and dogs
<A NAME="1311"></A><BR>Come to themselves again. And fawning breed
<A NAME="1312"></A><BR>Of house-bred whelps do feel the sudden urge
<A NAME="1313"></A><BR>To shake their bodies and start from off the ground,
<A NAME="1314"></A><BR>As if beholding stranger-visages.
<A NAME="1315"></A><BR>And ever the fiercer be the stock, the more
<A NAME="1316"></A><BR>In sleep the same is ever bound to rage.
<A NAME="1317"></A><BR>But fleet the divers tribes of birds and vex
<A NAME="1318"></A><BR>With sudden wings by night the groves of gods,
<A NAME="1319"></A><BR>When in their gentle slumbers they have dreamed
<A NAME="1320"></A><BR>Of hawks in chase, aswooping on for fight.
<A NAME="1321"></A><BR>Again, the minds of mortals which perform
<A NAME="1322"></A><BR>With mighty motions mighty enterprises,
<A NAME="1323"></A><BR>Often in sleep will do and dare the same
<A NAME="1324"></A><BR>In manner like. Kings take the towns by storm,
<A NAME="1325"></A><BR>Succumb to capture, battle on the field,
<A NAME="1326"></A><BR>Raise a wild cry as if their throats were cut
<A NAME="1327"></A><BR>Even then and there. And many wrestle on
<A NAME="1328"></A><BR>And groan with pains, and fill all regions round
<A NAME="1329"></A><BR>With mighty cries and wild, as if then gnawed
<A NAME="1330"></A><BR>By fangs of panther or of lion fierce.
<A NAME="1331"></A><BR>Many amid their slumbers talk about
<A NAME="1332"></A><BR>Their mighty enterprises, and have often
<A NAME="1333"></A><BR>Enough become the proof of their own crimes.
<A NAME="1334"></A><BR>Many meet death; many, as if headlong
<A NAME="1335"></A><BR>From lofty mountains tumbling down to earth
<A NAME="1336"></A><BR>With all their frame, are frenzied in their fright;
<A NAME="1337"></A><BR>And after sleep, as if still mad in mind,
<A NAME="1338"></A><BR>They scarce come to, confounded as they are
<A NAME="1339"></A><BR>By ferment of their frame. The thirsty man,
<A NAME="1340"></A><BR>Likewise, he sits beside delightful spring
<A NAME="1341"></A><BR>Or river and gulpeth down with gaping throat
<A NAME="1342"></A><BR>Nigh the whole stream. And oft the innocent young,
<A NAME="1343"></A><BR>By sleep o'ermastered, think they lift their dress
<A NAME="1344"></A><BR>By pail or public jordan and then void
<A NAME="1345"></A><BR>The water filtered down their frame entire
<A NAME="1346"></A><BR>And drench the Babylonian coverlets,
<A NAME="1347"></A><BR>Magnificently bright. Again, those males
<A NAME="1348"></A><BR>Into the surging channels of whose years
<A NAME="1349"></A><BR>Now first has passed the seed (engendered
<A NAME="1350"></A><BR>Within their members by the ripened days)
<A NAME="1351"></A><BR>Are in their sleep confronted from without
<A NAME="1352"></A><BR>By idol-images of some fair form-
<A NAME="1353"></A><BR>Tidings of glorious face and lovely bloom,
<A NAME="1354"></A><BR>Which stir and goad the regions turgid now
<A NAME="1355"></A><BR>With seed abundant; so that, as it were
<A NAME="1356"></A><BR>With all the matter acted duly out,
<A NAME="1357"></A><BR>They pour the billows of a potent stream
<A NAME="1358"></A><BR>And stain their garment.
<A NAME="1359"></A><BR>And as said before,
<A NAME="1360"></A><BR>That seed is roused in us when once ripe age
<A NAME="1361"></A><BR>Has made our body strong...
<A NAME="1362"></A><BR><BR>As divers causes give to divers things
<A NAME="1363"></A><BR>Impulse and irritation, so one force
<A NAME="1364"></A><BR>In human kind rouses the human seed
<A NAME="1365"></A><BR>To spurt from man. As soon as ever it issues,
<A NAME="1366"></A><BR>Forced from its first abodes, it passes down
<A NAME="1367"></A><BR>In the whole body through the limbs and frame,
<A NAME="1368"></A><BR>Meeting in certain regions of our thews,
<A NAME="1369"></A><BR>And stirs amain the genitals of man.
<A NAME="1370"></A><BR>The goaded regions swell with seed, and then
<A NAME="1371"></A><BR>Comes the delight to dart the same at what
<A NAME="1372"></A><BR>The mad desire so yearns, and body seeks
<A NAME="1373"></A><BR>That object, whence the mind by love is pierced.
<A NAME="1374"></A><BR>For well-nigh each man falleth toward his wound,
<A NAME="1375"></A><BR>And our blood spurts even toward the spot from whence
<A NAME="1376"></A><BR>The stroke wherewith we are strook, and if indeed
<A NAME="1377"></A><BR>The foe be close, the red jet reaches him.
<A NAME="1378"></A><BR>Thus, one who gets a stroke from Venus' shafts-
<A NAME="1379"></A><BR>Whether a boy with limbs effeminate
<A NAME="1380"></A><BR>Assault him, or a woman darting love
<A NAME="1381"></A><BR>From all her body- that one strains to get
<A NAME="1382"></A><BR>Even to the thing whereby he's hit, and longs
<A NAME="1383"></A><BR>To join with it and cast into its frame
<A NAME="1384"></A><BR>The fluid drawn even from within its own.
<A NAME="1385"></A><BR>For the mute craving doth presage delight.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1386"></A><B>The Passion of Love</B>

<A NAME="1387"></A><BR><BR>This craving 'tis that's Venus unto us:
<A NAME="1388"></A><BR>From this, engender all the lures of love,
<A NAME="1389"></A><BR>From this, O first hath into human hearts
<A NAME="1390"></A><BR>Trickled that drop of joyance which ere long
<A NAME="1391"></A><BR>Is by chill care succeeded. Since, indeed,
<A NAME="1392"></A><BR>Though she thou lovest now be far away,
<A NAME="1393"></A><BR>Yet idol-images of her are near
<A NAME="1394"></A><BR>And the sweet name is floating in thy ear.
<A NAME="1395"></A><BR>But it behooves to flee those images;
<A NAME="1396"></A><BR>And scare afar whatever feeds thy love;
<A NAME="1397"></A><BR>And turn elsewhere thy mind; and vent the sperm,
<A NAME="1398"></A><BR>Within thee gathered, into sundry bodies,
<A NAME="1399"></A><BR>Nor, with thy thoughts still busied with one love,
<A NAME="1400"></A><BR>Keep it for one delight, and so store up
<A NAME="1401"></A><BR>Care for thyself and pain inevitable.
<A NAME="1402"></A><BR>For, lo, the ulcer just by nourishing
<A NAME="1403"></A><BR>Grows to more life with deep inveteracy,
<A NAME="1404"></A><BR>And day by day the fury swells aflame,
<A NAME="1405"></A><BR>And the woe waxes heavier day by day-
<A NAME="1406"></A><BR>Unless thou dost destroy even by new blows
<A NAME="1407"></A><BR>The former wounds of love, and curest them
<A NAME="1408"></A><BR>While yet they're fresh, by wandering freely round
<A NAME="1409"></A><BR>After the freely-wandering Venus, or
<A NAME="1410"></A><BR>Canst lead elsewhere the tumults of thy mind.
<A NAME="1411"></A><BR>Nor doth that man who keeps away from love
<A NAME="1412"></A><BR>Yet lack the fruits of Venus; rather takes
<A NAME="1413"></A><BR>Those pleasures which are free of penalties.
<A NAME="1414"></A><BR>For the delights of Venus, verily,
<A NAME="1415"></A><BR>Are more unmixed for mortals sane-of-soul
<A NAME="1416"></A><BR>Than for those sick-at-heart with love-pining.
<A NAME="1417"></A><BR>Yea, in the very moment of possessing,
<A NAME="1418"></A><BR>Surges the heat of lovers to and fro,
<A NAME="1419"></A><BR>Restive, uncertain; and they cannot fix
<A NAME="1420"></A><BR>On what to first enjoy with eyes and hands.
<A NAME="1421"></A><BR>The parts they sought for, those they squeeze so 
<A NAME="1422"></A>tight,
<A NAME="1423"></A><BR>And pain the creature's body, close their teeth
<A NAME="1424"></A><BR>Often against her lips, and smite with kiss
<A NAME="1425"></A><BR>Mouth into mouth,- because this same delight
<A NAME="1426"></A><BR>Is not unmixed; and underneath are stings
<A NAME="1427"></A><BR>Which goad a man to hurt the very thing,
<A NAME="1428"></A><BR>Whate'er it be, from whence arise for him
<A NAME="1429"></A><BR>Those germs of madness. But with gentle touch
<A NAME="1430"></A><BR>Venus subdues the pangs in midst of love,
<A NAME="1431"></A><BR>And the admixture of a fondling joy
<A NAME="1432"></A><BR>Doth curb the bites of passion. For they hope
<A NAME="1433"></A><BR>That by the very body whence they caught
<A NAME="1434"></A><BR>The heats of love their flames can be put out.
<A NAME="1435"></A><BR>But Nature protests 'tis all quite otherwise;
<A NAME="1436"></A><BR>For this same love it is the one sole thing
<A NAME="1437"></A><BR>Of which, the more we have, the fiercer burns
<A NAME="1438"></A><BR>The breast with fell desire. For food and drink
<A NAME="1439"></A><BR>Are taken within our members; and, since they
<A NAME="1440"></A><BR>Can stop up certain parts, thus, easily
<A NAME="1441"></A><BR>Desire of water is glutted and of bread.
<A NAME="1442"></A><BR>But, lo, from human face and lovely bloom
<A NAME="1443"></A><BR>Naught penetrates our frame to be enjoyed
<A NAME="1444"></A><BR>Save flimsy idol-images and vain-
<A NAME="1445"></A><BR>A sorry hope which oft the winds disperse.
<A NAME="1446"></A><BR>As when the thirsty man in slumber seeks
<A NAME="1447"></A><BR>To drink, and water ne'er is granted him
<A NAME="1448"></A><BR>Wherewith to quench the heat within his members,
<A NAME="1449"></A><BR>But after idols of the liquids strives
<A NAME="1450"></A><BR>And toils in vain, and thirsts even whilst he gulps
<A NAME="1451"></A><BR>In middle of the torrent, thus in love
<A NAME="1452"></A><BR>Venus deludes with idol-images
<A NAME="1453"></A><BR>The lovers. Nor they cannot sate their lust
<A NAME="1454"></A><BR>By merely gazing on the bodies, nor
<A NAME="1455"></A><BR>They cannot with their palms and fingers rub
<A NAME="1456"></A><BR>Aught from each tender limb, the while they stray
<A NAME="1457"></A><BR>Uncertain over all the body. Then,
<A NAME="1458"></A><BR>At last, with members intertwined, when they
<A NAME="1459"></A><BR>Enjoy the flower of their age, when now
<A NAME="1460"></A><BR>Their bodies have sweet presage of keen joys,
<A NAME="1461"></A><BR>And Venus is about to sow the fields
<A NAME="1462"></A><BR>Of woman, greedily their frames they lock,
<A NAME="1463"></A><BR>And mingle the slaver of their mouths, and breathe
<A NAME="1464"></A><BR>Into each other, pressing teeth on mouths-
<A NAME="1465"></A><BR>Yet to no purpose, since they're powerless
<A NAME="1466"></A><BR>To rub off aught, or penetrate and pass
<A NAME="1467"></A><BR>With body entire into body- for oft
<A NAME="1468"></A><BR>They seem to strive and struggle thus to do;
<A NAME="1469"></A><BR>So eagerly they cling in Venus' bonds,
<A NAME="1470"></A><BR>Whilst melt away their members, overcome
<A NAME="1471"></A><BR>By violence of delight. But when at last
<A NAME="1472"></A><BR>Lust, gathered in the thews, hath spent itself,
<A NAME="1473"></A><BR>There come a brief pause in the raging heat-
<A NAME="1474"></A><BR>But then a madness just the same returns
<A NAME="1475"></A><BR>And that old fury visits them again,
<A NAME="1476"></A><BR>When once again they seek and crave to reach
<A NAME="1477"></A><BR>They know not what, all powerless to find
<A NAME="1478"></A><BR>The artifice to subjugate the bane.
<A NAME="1479"></A><BR>In such uncertain state they waste away
<A NAME="1480"></A><BR>With unseen wound.
<A NAME="1481"></A><BR>To which be added too,
<A NAME="1482"></A><BR>They squander powers and with the travail wane;
<A NAME="1483"></A><BR>Be added too, they spend their futile years
<A NAME="1484"></A><BR>Under another's beck and call; their duties
<A NAME="1485"></A><BR>Neglected languish and their honest name
<A NAME="1486"></A><BR>Reeleth sick, sick; and meantime their estates
<A NAME="1487"></A><BR>Are lost in Babylonian tapestries;
<A NAME="1488"></A><BR>And unguents and dainty Sicyonian shoes
<A NAME="1489"></A><BR>Laugh on their feet; and (as ye may be sure)
<A NAME="1490"></A><BR>Big emeralds of green light are set in gold;
<A NAME="1491"></A><BR>And rich sea-purple dress by constant wear
<A NAME="1492"></A><BR>Grows shabby and all soaked with Venus' sweat;
<A NAME="1493"></A><BR>And the well-earned ancestral property
<A NAME="1494"></A><BR>Becometh head-bands, coifs, and many a time
<A NAME="1495"></A><BR>The cloaks, or garments Alidensian
<A NAME="1496"></A><BR>Or of the Cean isle. And banquets, set
<A NAME="1497"></A><BR>With rarest cloth and viands, are prepared-
