<A NAME="10"></A><B>Proem</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>O thou who first uplifted in such dark
<A NAME="12"></A><BR>So clear a torch aloft, who first shed light
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>Upon the profitable ends of man,
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>O thee I follow, glory of the Greeks,
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>And set my footsteps squarely planted now
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>Even in the impress and the marks of thine-
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>Less like one eager to dispute the palm,
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>More as one craving out of very love
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>That I may copy thee!- for how should swallow
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>Contend with swans or what compare could be
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>In a race between young kids with tumbling legs
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>And the strong might of the horse? Our father thou,
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>And finder-out of truth, and thou to us
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>Suppliest a father's precepts; and from out
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>Those scriven leaves of thine, renowned soul
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>(Like bees that sip of all in flowery wolds),
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>We feed upon thy golden sayings all-
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>Golden, and ever worthiest endless life.
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>For soon as ever thy planning thought that sprang
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>From god-like mind begins its loud proclaim
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>Of nature's courses, terrors of the brain
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>Asunder flee, the ramparts of the world
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>Dispart away, and through the void entire
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>I see the movements of the universe.
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>Rises to vision the majesty of gods,
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>And their abodes of everlasting calm
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>Which neither wind may shake nor rain-cloud splash,
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>Nor snow, congealed by sharp frosts, may harm
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>With its white downfall: ever, unclouded sky
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>O'er roofs, and laughs with far-diffused light.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>And nature gives to them their all, nor aught
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>May ever pluck their peace of mind away.
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>But nowhere to my vision rise no more
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>The vaults of Acheron, though the broad earth
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>Bars me no more from gazing down o'er all
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>Which under our feet is going on below
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>Along the void. O, here in these affairs
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>Some new divine delight and trembling awe
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>Takes hold through me, that thus by power of thine
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>Nature, so plain and manifest at last,
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>Hath been on every side laid bare to man!
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR>And since I've taught already of what sort
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>The seeds of all things are, and how, distinct
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>In divers forms, they flit of own accord,
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>Stirred with a motion everlasting on,
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>And in what mode things be from them create,
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>Now, after such matters, should my verse, meseems,
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>Make clear the nature of the mind and soul,
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>And drive that dread of Acheron without,
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>Headlong, which so confounds our human life
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>Unto its deeps, pouring o'er all that is
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>The black of death, nor leaves not anything
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>To prosper- a liquid and unsullied joy.
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>For as to what men sometimes will affirm:
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>That more than Tartarus (the realm of death)
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>They fear diseases and a life of shame,
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>And know the substance of the soul is blood,
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>Or rather wind (if haply thus their whim),
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>And so need naught of this our science, then
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>Thou well may'st note from what's to follow now
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>That more for glory do they braggart forth
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>Than for belief. For mark these very same:
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>Exiles from country, fugitives afar
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>From sight of men, with charges foul attaint,
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>Abased with every wretchedness, they yet
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>Live, and where'er the wretches come, they yet
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>Make the ancestral sacrifices there,
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>Butcher the black sheep, and to gods below
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>Offer the honours, and in bitter case
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>Turn much more keenly to religion.
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>Wherefore, it's surer testing of a man
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>In doubtful perils- mark him as he is
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>Amid adversities; for then alone
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>Are the true voices conjured from his breast,
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>The mask off-stripped, reality behind.
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>And greed, again, and the blind lust of honours
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>Which force poor wretches past the bounds of law,
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>And, oft allies and ministers of crime,
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>To push through nights and days of the hugest toil
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>To rise untrammelled to the peaks of power-
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>These wounds of life in no mean part are kept
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>Festering and open by this fright of death.
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>For ever we see fierce Want and foul Disgrace
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>Dislodged afar from secure life and sweet,
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>Like huddling Shapes before the doors of death.
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>And whilst, from these, men wish to scape afar,
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>Driven by false terror, and afar remove,
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>With civic blood a fortune they amass,
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>They double their riches, greedy, heapers-up
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>Of corpse on corpse they have a cruel laugh
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>For the sad burial of a brother-born,
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>And hatred and fear of tables of their kin.
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>Likewise, through this same terror, envy oft
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>Makes them to peak because before their eyes
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>That man is lordly, that man gazed upon
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>Who walks begirt with honour glorious,
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>Whilst they in filth and darkness roll around;
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>Some perish away for statues and a name,
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>And oft to that degree, from fright of death,
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>Will hate of living and beholding light
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>Take hold on humankind that they inflict
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>Their own destruction with a gloomy heart-
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>Forgetful that this fear is font of cares,
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>This fear the plague upon their sense of shame,
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>And this that breaks the ties of comradry
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>And oversets all reverence and faith,
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>Mid direst slaughter. For long ere to-day
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>Often were traitors to country and dear parents
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>Through quest to shun the realms of Acheron.
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>For just as children tremble and fear all
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>In the viewless dark, so even we at times
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>Dread in the light so many things that be
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>No whit more fearsome than what children feign,
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>Shuddering, will be upon them in the dark.
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>This terror, then, this darkness of the mind,
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>Not sunrise with its flaring spokes of light,
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>Nor glittering arrows of morning sun disperse,
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>But only Nature's aspect and her law.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="129"></A><B>Nature and Composition of the Mind</B>

<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR>First, then, I say, the mind which oft we call
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>The intellect, wherein is seated life's
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>Counsel and regimen, is part no less
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>Of man than hand and foot and eyes are parts
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>Of one whole breathing creature. But some hold
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>That sense of mind is in no fixed part seated,
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>But is of body some one vital state,-
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>Named "harmony" by Greeks, because thereby
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>We live with sense, though intellect be not
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>In any part: as oft the body is said
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>To have good health (when health, however, 's not
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>One part of him who has it), so they place
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>The sense of mind in no fixed part of man.
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>Mightily, diversly, meseems they err.
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>Often the body palpable and seen
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>Sickens, while yet in some invisible part
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>We feel a pleasure; oft the other way,
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>A miserable in mind feels pleasure still
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>Throughout his body- quite the same as when
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>A foot may pain without a pain in head.
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>Besides, when these our limbs are given o'er
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>To gentle sleep and lies the burdened frame
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>At random void of sense, a something else
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>Is yet within us, which upon that time
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>Bestirs itself in many a wise, receiving
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>All motions of joy and phantom cares of heart.
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>Now, for to see that in man's members dwells
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>Also the soul, and body ne'er is wont
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>To feel sensation by a "harmony"
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>Take this in chief: the fact that life remains
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>Oft in our limbs, when much of body's gone;
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>Yet that same life, when particles of heat,
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>Though few, have scattered been, and through the 
<A NAME="163"></A>mouth
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>Air has been given forth abroad, forthwith
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>Forever deserts the veins, and leaves the bones.
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>Thus mayst thou know that not all particles
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>Perform like parts, nor in like manner all
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>Are props of weal and safety: rather those-
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>The seeds of wind and exhalations warm-
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>Take care that in our members life remains.
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>Therefore a vital heat and wind there is
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>Within the very body, which at death
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>Deserts our frames. And so, since nature of mind
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>And even of soul is found to be, as 'twere,
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>A part of man, give over "harmony"-
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>Name to musicians brought from Helicon,-
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>Unless themselves they filched it otherwise,
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>To serve for what was lacking name till then.
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>Whate'er it be, they're welcome to it- thou,
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>Hearken my other maxims.
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>Mind and soul,
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>I say, are held conjoined one with other,
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>And form one single nature of themselves;
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>But chief and regnant through the frame entire
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>Is still that counsel which we call the mind,
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>And that cleaves seated in the midmost breast.
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>Here leap dismay and terror; round these haunts
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>Be blandishments of joys; and therefore here
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>The intellect, the mind. The rest of soul,
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>Throughout the body scattered, but obeys-
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>Moved by the nod and motion of the mind.
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>This, for itself, sole through itself, hath thought;
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>This for itself hath mirth, even when the thing
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>That moves it, moves nor soul nor body at all.
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>And as, when head or eye in us is smit
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>By assailing pain, we are not tortured then
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>Through all the body, so the mind alone
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>Is sometimes smitten, or livens with a joy,
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>Whilst yet the soul's remainder through the limbs
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>And through the frame is stirred by nothing new.
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>But when the mind is moved by shock more fierce,
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>We mark the whole soul suffering all at once
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>Along man's members: sweats and pallors spread
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>Over the body, and the tongue is broken,
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>And fails the voice away, and ring the ears,
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>Mists blind the eyeballs, and the joints collapse,-
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>Aye, men drop dead from terror of the mind.
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>Hence, whoso will can readily remark
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>That soul conjoined is with mind, and, when
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>'Tis strook by influence of the mind, forthwith
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>In turn it hits and drives the body too.
<A NAME="212"></A><BR><BR>And this same argument establisheth
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>That nature of mind and soul corporeal is:
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>For when 'tis seen to drive the members on,
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>To snatch from sleep the body, and to change
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>The countenance, and the whole state of man
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>To rule and turn,- what yet could never be
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>Sans contact, and sans body contact fails-
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>Must we not grant that mind and soul consist
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>Of a corporeal nature?- And besides
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>Thou markst that likewise with this body of ours
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>Suffers the mind and with our body feels.
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>If the dire speed of spear that cleaves the bones
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>And bares the inner thews hits not the life,
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>Yet follows a fainting and a foul collapse,
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>And, on the ground, dazed tumult in the mind,
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>And whiles a wavering will to rise afoot.
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>So nature of mind must be corporeal, since
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>From stroke and spear corporeal 'tis in throes.
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>Now, of what body, what components formed
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>Is this same mind I will go on to tell.
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>First, I aver, 'tis superfine, composed
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>Of tiniest particles- that such the fact
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>Thou canst perceive, if thou attend, from this:
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>Nothing is seen to happen with such speed
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>As what the mind proposes and begins;
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>Therefore the same bestirs itself more swiftly
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>Than aught whose nature's palpable to eyes.
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>But what's so agile must of seeds consist
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>Most round, most tiny, that they may be moved,
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>When hit by impulse slight. So water moves,
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>In waves along, at impulse just the least-
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>Being create of little shapes that roll;
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>But, contrariwise, the quality of honey
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>More stable is, its liquids more inert,
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>More tardy its flow; for all its stock of matter
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>Cleaves more together, since, indeed, 'tis made
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>Of atoms not so smooth, so fine, and round.
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>For the light breeze that hovers yet can blow
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>High heaps of poppy-seed away for thee
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>Downward from off the top; but, contrariwise,
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>A pile of stones or spiny ears of wheat
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>It can't at all. Thus, in so far as bodies
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>Are small and smooth, is their mobility;
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>But, contrariwise, the heavier and more rough,
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>The more immovable they prove. Now, then,
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>Since nature of mind is movable so much,
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>Consist it must of seeds exceeding small
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>And smooth and round. Which fact once known to thee,
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>Good friend, will serve thee opportune in else.
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>This also shows the nature of the same,
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>How nice its texture, in how small a space
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>'Twould go, if once compacted as a pellet:
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>When death's unvexed repose gets hold on man
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>And mind and soul retire, thou markest there
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>From the whole body nothing ta'en in form,
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>Nothing in weight. Death grants ye everything,
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>But vital sense and exhalation hot.
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>Thus soul entire must be of smallmost seeds,
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>Twined through the veins, the vitals, and the thews,
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>Seeing that, when 'tis from whole body gone,
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>The outward figuration of the limbs
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>Is unimpaired and weight fails not a whit.
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>Just so, when vanished the bouquet of wine,
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>Or when an unguent's perfume delicate
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>Into the winds away departs, or when
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>From any body savour's gone, yet still
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>The thing itself seems minished naught to eyes,
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>Thereby, nor aught abstracted from its weight-
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>No marvel, because seeds many and minute
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>Produce the savours and the redolence
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>In the whole body of the things. And so,
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>Again, again, nature of mind and soul
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>'Tis thine to know created is of seeds
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>The tiniest ever, since at flying-forth
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>It beareth nothing of the weight away.
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>Yet fancy not its nature simple so.
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>For an impalpable aura, mixed with heat,
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>Deserts the dying, and heat draws off the air;
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>And heat there's none, unless commixed with air:
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>For, since the nature of all heat is rare,
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>Athrough it many seeds of air must move.
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>Thus nature of mind is triple; yet those all
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>Suffice not for creating sense- since mind
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>Accepteth not that aught of these can cause
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>Sense-bearing motions, and much less the thoughts
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>A man revolves in mind. So unto these
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>Must added be a somewhat, and a fourth;
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>That somewhat's altogether void of name;
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>Than which existeth naught more mobile, naught
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>More an impalpable, of elements
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>More small and smooth and round. That first transmits
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>Sense-bearing motions through the frame, for that
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>Is roused the first, composed of little shapes;
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>Thence heat and viewless force of wind take up
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>The motions, and thence air, and thence all things
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>Are put in motion; the blood is strook, and then
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>The vitals all begin to feel, and last
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>To bones and marrow the sensation comes-
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>Pleasure or torment. Nor will pain for naught
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>Enter so far, nor a sharp ill seep through,
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>But all things be perturbed to that degree
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>That room for life will fail, and parts of soul
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>Will scatter through the body's every pore.
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>Yet as a rule, almost upon the skin
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>These motion aIl are stopped, and this is why
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>We have the power to retain our life.
<A NAME="318"></A><BR><BR>Now in my eagerness to tell thee how
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>They are commixed, through what unions fit
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>They function so, my country's pauper-speech
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>Constrains me sadly. As I can, however,
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>I'll touch some points and pass. In such a wise
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>Course these primordials 'mongst one another
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>With intermotions that no one can be
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>From other sundered, nor its agency
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>Perform, if once divided by a space;
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>Like many powers in one body they work.
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>As in the flesh of any creature still
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>Is odour and savour and a certain warmth,
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>And yet from an of these one bulk of body
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>Is made complete, so, viewless force of wind
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>And warmth and air, commingled, do create
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>One nature, by that mobile energy
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>Assisted which from out itself to them
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>Imparts initial motion, whereby first
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>Sense-bearing motion along the vitals springs.
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>For lurks this essence far and deep and under,
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>Nor in our body is aught more shut from view,
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>And 'tis the very soul of all the soul.
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>And as within our members and whole frame
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>The energy of mind and power of soul
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>Is mixed and latent, since create it is
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>Of bodies small and few, so lurks this fourth,
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>This essence void of name, composed of small,
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>And seems the very soul of all the soul,
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>And holds dominion o'er the body all.
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>And by like reason wind and air and heat
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>Must function so, commingled through the frame,
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>And now the one subside and now another
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>In interchange of dominance, that thus
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>From all of them one nature be produced,
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>Lest heat and wind apart, and air apart,
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>Make sense to perish, by disseverment.
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>There is indeed in mind that heat it gets
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>When seething in rage, and flashes from the eyes
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>More swiftly fire; there is, again, that wind,
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>Much, and so cold, companion of all dread,
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>Which rouses the shudder in the shaken frame;
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>There is no less that state of air composed,
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>Making the tranquil breast, the serene face.
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>But more of hot have they whose restive hearts,
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>Whose minds of passion quickly seethe in rage-
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>Of which kind chief are fierce abounding lions,
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>Who often with roaring burst the breast o'erwrought,
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>Unable to hold the surging wrath within;
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>But the cold mind of stags has more of wind,
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>And speedier through their inwards rouses up
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>The icy currents which make their members quake.
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>But more the oxen live by tranquil air,
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>Nor e'er doth smoky torch of wrath applied,
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>O'erspreading with shadows of a darkling murk,
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>Rouse them too far; nor will they stiffen stark,
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>Pierced through by icy javelins of fear;
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>But have their place half-way between the two-
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>Stags and fierce lions. Thus the race of men:
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>Though training make them equally refined,
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>It leaves those pristine vestiges behind
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>Of each mind's nature. Nor may we suppose
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>Evil can e'er be rooted up so far
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>That one man's not more given to fits of wrath,
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>Another's not more quickly touched by fear,
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>A third not more long-suffering than he should.
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>And needs must differ in many things besides
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>The varied natures and resulting habits
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>Of humankind- of which not now can I
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>Expound the hidden causes, nor find names
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>Enough for all the divers shapes of those
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>Primordials whence this variation springs.
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>But this meseems I'm able to declare:
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>Those vestiges of natures left behind
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>Which reason cannot quite expel from us
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>Are still so slight that naught prevents a man
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>From living a life even worthy of the gods.
<A NAME="394"></A><BR><BR>So then this soul is kept by all the body,
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>Itself the body's guard, and source of weal;
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>For they with common roots cleave each to each,
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>Nor can be torn asunder without death.
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>Not easy 'tis from lumps of frankincense
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>To tear their fragrance forth, without its nature
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>Perishing likewise: so, not easy 'tis
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>From all the body nature of mind and soul
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>To draw away, without the whole dissolved.
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>With seeds so intertwined even from birth,
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>They're dowered conjointly with a partner-life;
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>No energy of body or mind, apart,
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>Each of itself without the other's power,
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>Can have sensation; but our sense, enkindled
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>Along the vitals, to flame is blown by both
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>With mutual motions. Besides the body alone
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>Is nor begot nor grows, nor after death
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>Seen to endure. For not as water at times
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>Gives off the alien heat, nor is thereby
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>Itself destroyed, but unimpaired remains-
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>Not thus, I say, can the deserted frame
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>Bear the dissevering of its joined soul,
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>But, rent and ruined, moulders all away.
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>Thus the joint contact of the body and soul
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>Learns from their earliest age the vital motions,
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>Even when still buried in the mother's womb;
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>So no dissevering can hap to them,
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>Without their bane and ill. And thence mayst see
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>That, as conjoined is their source of weal,
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>Conjoined also must their nature be.
<A NAME="424"></A><BR><BR>If one, moreover, denies that body feel,
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>And holds that soul, through all the body mixed,
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>Takes on this motion which we title "sense"
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>He battles in vain indubitable facts:
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>For who'll explain what body's feeling is,
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>Except by what the public fact itself
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>Has given and taught us? "But when soul is parted,
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>Body's without all sense." True!- loses what
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>Was even in its life-time not its own;
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>And much beside it loses, when soul's driven
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>Forth from that life-time. Or, to say that eyes
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>Themselves can see no thing, but through the same
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>The mind looks forth, as out of opened doors,
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>Is- a hard saying; since the feel in eyes
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>Says the reverse. For this itself draws on
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>And forces into the pupils of our eyes
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>Our consciousness. And note the case when often
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>We lack the power to see refulgent things,
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>Because our eyes are hampered by their light-
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>With a mere doorway this would happen not;
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>For, since it is our very selves that see,
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>No open portals undertake the toil.
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>Besides, if eyes of ours but act as doors,
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>Methinks that, were our sight removed, the mind
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>Ought then still better to behold a thing-
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>When even the door-posts have been cleared away.
<A NAME="450"></A><BR><BR>Herein in these affairs nowise take up
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>What honoured sage, Democritus, lays down-
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>That proposition, that primordials
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>Of body and mind, each super-posed on each,
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>Vary alternately and interweave
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>The fabric of our members. For not only
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>Are the soul-elements smaller far than those
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>Which this our body and inward parts compose,
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>But also are they in their number less,
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>And scattered sparsely through our frame. And thus
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>This canst thou guarantee: soul's primal germs
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>Maintain between them intervals as large
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>At least as are the smallest bodies, which,
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>When thrown against us, in our body rouse
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>Sense-bearing motions. Hence it comes that we
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>Sometimes don't feel alighting on our frames
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>The clinging dust, or chalk that settles soft;
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>Nor mists of night, nor spider's gossamer
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>We feel against us, when, upon our road,
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>Its net entangles us, nor on our head
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>The dropping of its withered garmentings;
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>Nor bird-feathers, nor vegetable down,
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>Flying about, so light they barely fall;
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>Nor feel the steps of every crawling thing,
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>Nor each of all those footprints on our skin
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>Of midges and the like. To that degree
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>Must many primal germs be stirred in us
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>Ere once the seeds of soul that through our frame
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>Are intermingled 'gin to feel that those
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>Primordials of the body have been strook,
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>And ere, in pounding with such gaps between,
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>They clash, combine and leap apart in turn.
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>But mind is more the keeper of the gates,
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>Hath more dominion over life than soul.
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>For without intellect and mind there's not
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>One part of soul can rest within our frame
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>Least part of time; companioning, it goes
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>With mind into the winds away, and leaves
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>The icy members in the cold of death.
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>But he whose mind and intellect abide
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>Himself abides in life. However much
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>The trunk be mangled, with the limbs lopped off,
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>The soul withdrawn and taken from the limbs,
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>Still lives the trunk and draws the vital air.
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>Even when deprived of all but all the soul,
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>Yet will it linger on and cleave to life,-
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>Just as the power of vision still is strong,
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>If but the pupil shall abide unharmed,
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>Even when the eye around it's sorely rent-
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>Provided only thou destroyest not
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>Wholly the ball, but, cutting round the pupil,
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>Leavest that pupil by itself behind-
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>For more would ruin sight. But if that centre,
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>That tiny part of eye, be eaten through,
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>Forthwith the vision fails and darkness comes,
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>Though in all else the unblemished ball be clear.
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>'Tis by like compact that the soul and mind
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>Are each to other bound forevermore.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="508"></A><B>The Soul is Mortal</B>

<A NAME="509"></A><BR><BR>Now come: that thou mayst able be to know
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>That minds and the light souls of all that live
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>Have mortal birth and death, I will go on
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>Verses to build meet for thy rule of life,
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>Sought after long, discovered with sweet toil.
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>But under one name I'd have thee yoke them both;
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>And when, for instance, I shall speak of soul,
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>Teaching the same to be but mortal, think
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>Thereby I'm speaking also of the mind-
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>Since both are one, a substance interjoined.
<A NAME="519"></A><BR><BR>First, then, since I have taught how soul exists
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>A subtle fabric, of particles minute,
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>Made up from atoms smaller much than those
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>Of water's liquid damp, or fog, or smoke,
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>So in mobility it far excels,
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>More prone to move, though strook by lighter cause
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>Even moved by images of smoke or fog-
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>As where we view, when in our sleeps we're lulled,
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>The altars exhaling steam and smoke aloft-
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>For, beyond doubt, these apparitions come
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>To us from outward. Now, then, since thou seest,
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>Their liquids depart, their waters flow away,
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>When jars are shivered, and since fog and smoke
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>Depart into the winds away, believe
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>The soul no less is shed abroad and dies
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>More quickly far, more quickly is dissolved
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>Back to its primal bodies, when withdrawn
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>From out man's members it has gone away.
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>For, sure, if body (container of the same
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>Like as a jar), when shivered from some cause,
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>And rarefied by loss of blood from veins,
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>Cannot for longer hold the soul, how then
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>Thinkst thou it can be held by any air-
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>A stuff much rarer than our bodies be?
<A NAME="543"></A><BR><BR>Besides we feel that mind to being comes
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>Along with body, with body grows and ages.
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>For just as children totter round about
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>With frames infirm and tender, so there follows
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>A weakling wisdom in their minds; and then,
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>Where years have ripened into robust powers,
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>Counsel is also greater, more increased
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>The power of mind; thereafter, where already
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>The body's shattered by master-powers of eld,
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>And fallen the frame with its enfeebled powers,
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>Thought hobbles, tongue wanders, and the mind gives 
<A NAME="554"></A>way;
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>All fails, all's lacking at the selfsame time.
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>Therefore it suits that even the soul's dissolved,
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>Like smoke, into the lofty winds of air;
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>Since we behold the same to being come
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>Along with body and grow, and, as I've taught,
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>Crumble and crack, therewith outworn by eld.
<A NAME="561"></A><BR><BR>Then, too, we see, that, just as body takes
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>Monstrous diseases and the dreadful pain,
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>So mind its bitter cares, the grief, the fear;
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>Wherefore it tallies that the mind no less
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>Partaker is of death; for pain and disease
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>Are both artificers of death,- as well
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>We've learned by the passing of many a man ere now.
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>Nay, too, in diseases of body, often the mind
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>Wanders afield; for 'tis beside itself,
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>And crazed it speaks, or many a time it sinks,
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>With eyelids closing and a drooping nod,
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>In heavy drowse, on to eternal sleep;
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>From whence nor hears it any voices more,
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>Nor able is to know the faces here
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>Of those about him standing with wet cheeks
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>Who vainly call him back to light and life.
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>Wherefore mind too, confess we must, dissolves,
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>Seeing, indeed, contagions of disease
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>Enter into the same. Again, O why,
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>When the strong wine has entered into man,
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>And its diffused fire gone round the veins,
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>Why follows then a heaviness of limbs,
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>A tangle of the legs as round he reels,
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>A stuttering tongue, an intellect besoaked,
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>Eyes all aswim, and hiccups, shouts, and brawls
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>And whatso else is of that ilk?- Why this?-
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>If not that violent and impetuous wine
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>Is wont to confound the soul within the body?
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>But whatso can confounded be and balked,
<A NAME="590"></A><BR>Gives proof, that if a hardier cause got in,
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>'Twould hap that it would perish then, bereaved
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>Of any life thereafter. And, moreover,
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>Often will some one in a sudden fit,
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>As if by stroke of lightning, tumble down
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>Before our eyes, and sputter foam, and grunt,
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>Blither, and twist about with sinews taut,
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>Gasp up in starts, and weary out his limbs
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>With tossing round. No marvel, since distract
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>Through frame by violence of disease.
<A NAME="600"></A><BR><BR>Confounds, he foams, as if to vomit soul,
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>As on the salt sea boil the billows round
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>Under the master might of winds. And now
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>A groan's forced out, because his limbs are griped
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>But, in the main, because the seeds of voice
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>Are driven forth and carried in a mass
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>Outwards by mouth, where they are wont to go,
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>And have a builded highway. He becomes
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>Mere fool, since energy of mind and soul
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>Confounded is, and, as I've shown, to-riven,
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>Asunder thrown, and torn to pieces all
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>By the same venom. But, again, where cause
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>Of that disease has faced about, and back
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>Retreats sharp poison of corrupted frame
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>Into its shadowy lairs, the man at first
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>Arises reeling, and gradually comes back
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>To all his senses and recovers soul.
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>Thus, since within the body itself of man
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>The mind and soul are by such great diseases
<A NAME="619"></A><BR>Shaken, so miserably in labour distraught,
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>Why, then, believe that in the open air,
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>Without a body, they can pass their life,
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>Immortal, battling with the master winds?
<A NAME="623"></A><BR>And, since we mark the mind itself is cured,
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>Like the sick body, and restored can be
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>By medicine, this is forewarning to
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>That mortal lives the mind. For proper it is
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>That whosoe'er begins and undertakes
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>To alter the mind, or meditates to change
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>Any another nature soever, should add
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>New parts, or readjust the order given,
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>Or from the sum remove at least a bit.
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>But what's immortal willeth for itself
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>Its parts be nor increased, nor rearranged,
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>Nor any bit soever flow away:
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>For change of anything from out its bounds
<A NAME="636"></A><BR>Means instant death of that which was before.
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>Ergo, the mind, whether in sickness fallen,
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>Or by the medicine restored, gives signs,
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>As I have taught, of its mortality.
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>So surely will a fact of truth make head
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>'Gainst errors' theories all, and so shut off
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>All refuge from the adversary, and rout
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>Error by two-edged confutation.
<A NAME="644"></A><BR><BR>And since the mind is of a man one part,
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>Which in one fixed place remains, like ears,
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>And eyes, and every sense which pilots life;
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>And just as hand, or eye, or nose, apart,
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>Severed from us, can neither feel nor be,
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>But in the least of time is left to rot,
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>Thus mind alone can never be, without
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>The body and the man himself, which seems,
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>As 'twere the vessel of the same- or aught
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>Whate'er thou'lt feign as yet more closely joined:
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>Since body cleaves to mind by surest bonds.
<A NAME="655"></A><BR><BR>Again, the body's and the mind's live powers
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>Only in union prosper and enjoy;
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>For neither can nature of mind, alone of itself
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>Sans body, give the vital motions forth;
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>Nor, then, can body, wanting soul, endure
<A NAME="660"></A><BR>And use the senses. Verily, as the eye,
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>Alone, up-rended from its roots, apart
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>From all the body, can peer about at naught,
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>So soul and mind it seems are nothing able,
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>When by themselves. No marvel, because, commixed
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>Through veins and inwards, and through bones and 
<A NAME="666"></A>thews,
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>Their elements primordial are confined
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>By all the body, and own no power free
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>To bound around through interspaces big,
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>Thus, shut within these confines, they take on
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>Motions of sense, which, after death, thrown out
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>Beyond the body to the winds of air,
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>Take on they cannot- and on this account,
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>Because no more in such a way confined.
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>For air will be a body, be alive,
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>If in that air the soul can keep itself,
<A NAME="677"></A><BR>And in that air enclose those motions all
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>Which in the thews and in the body itself
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>A while ago 'twas making. So for this,
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>Again, again, I say confess we must,
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>That, when the body's wrappings are unwound,
<A NAME="682"></A><BR>And when the vital breath is forced without,
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>The soul, the senses of the mind dissolve,-
<A NAME="684"></A><BR>Since for the twain the cause and ground of life
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>Is in the fact of their conjoined estate.
<A NAME="686"></A><BR><BR>Once more, since body's unable to sustain
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>Division from the soul, without decay
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>And obscene stench, how canst thou doubt but that
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>The soul, uprisen from the body's deeps,
<A NAME="690"></A><BR>Has filtered away, wide-drifted like a smoke,
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>Or that the changed body crumbling fell
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>With ruin so entire, because, indeed,
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>Its deep foundations have been moved from place,
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>The soul out-filtering even through the frame,
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>And through the body's every winding way
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>And orifice? And so by many means
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>Thou'rt free to learn that nature of the soul
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>Hath passed in fragments out along the frame,
<A NAME="699"></A><BR>And that 'twas shivered in the very body
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>Ere ever it slipped abroad and swam away
<A NAME="701"></A><BR>Into the winds of air. For never a man
<A NAME="702"></A><BR>Dying appears to feel the soul go forth
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>As one sure whole from all his body at once,
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>Nor first come up the throat and into mouth;
<A NAME="705"></A><BR>But feels it failing in a certain spot,
<A NAME="706"></A><BR>Even as he knows the senses too dissolve
<A NAME="707"></A><BR>Each in its own location in the frame.
<A NAME="708"></A><BR>But were this mind of ours immortal mind,
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>Dying 'twould scarce bewail a dissolution,
<A NAME="710"></A><BR>But rather the going, the leaving of its coat,
<A NAME="711"></A><BR>Like to a snake. Wherefore, when once the body
<A NAME="712"></A><BR>Hath passed away, admit we must that soul,
<A NAME="713"></A><BR>Shivered in all that body, perished too.
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>Nay, even when moving in the bounds of life,
<A NAME="715"></A><BR>Often the soul, now tottering from some cause,
<A NAME="716"></A><BR>Craves to go out, and from the frame entire
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>Loosened to be; the countenance becomes
<A NAME="718"></A><BR>Flaccid, as if the supreme hour were there;
<A NAME="719"></A><BR>And flabbily collapse the members all
<A NAME="720"></A><BR>Against the bloodless trunk- the kind of case
<A NAME="721"></A><BR>We see when we remark in common phrase,
<A NAME="722"></A><BR>"That man's quite gone," or "fainted dead away";
<A NAME="723"></A><BR>And where there's now a bustle of alarm,
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>And all are eager to get some hold upon
<A NAME="725"></A><BR>The man's last link of life. For then the mind
<A NAME="726"></A><BR>And all the power of soul are shook so sore,
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>And these so totter along with all the frame,
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>That any cause a little stronger might
<A NAME="729"></A><BR>Dissolve them altogether.- Why, then, doubt
<A NAME="730"></A><BR>That soul, when once without the body thrust,
<A NAME="731"></A><BR>There in the open, an enfeebled thing,
<A NAME="732"></A><BR>Its wrappings stripped away, cannot endure
<A NAME="733"></A><BR>Not only through no everlasting age,
<A NAME="734"></A><BR>But even, indeed, through not the least of time?
<A NAME="735"></A><BR><BR>Then, too, why never is the intellect,
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>The counselling mind, begotten in the head,
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>The feet, the hands, instead of cleaving still
<A NAME="738"></A><BR>To one sole seat, to one fixed haunt, the breast,
<A NAME="739"></A><BR>If not that fixed places be assigned
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>For each thing's birth, where each, when 'tis create,
<A NAME="741"></A><BR>Is able to endure, and that our frames
<A NAME="742"></A><BR>Have such complex adjustments that no shift
<A NAME="743"></A><BR>In order of our members may appear?
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>To that degree effect succeeds to cause,
<A NAME="745"></A><BR>Nor is the flame once wont to be create
<A NAME="746"></A><BR>In flowing streams, nor cold begot in fire.
<A NAME="747"></A><BR>Besides, if nature of soul immortal be,
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>And able to feel, when from our frame disjoined,
<A NAME="749"></A><BR>The same, I fancy, must be thought to be
<A NAME="750"></A><BR>Endowed with senses five,- nor is there way
<A NAME="751"></A><BR>But this whereby to image to ourselves
<A NAME="752"></A><BR>How under-souls may roam in Acheron.
<A NAME="753"></A><BR>Thus painters and the elder race of bards
<A NAME="754"></A><BR>Have pictured souls with senses so endowed.
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>But neither eyes, nor nose, nor hand, alone
<A NAME="756"></A><BR>Apart from body can exist for soul,
<A NAME="757"></A><BR>Nor tongue nor ears apart. And hence indeed
<A NAME="758"></A><BR>Alone by self they can nor feel nor be.
<A NAME="759"></A><BR><BR>And since we mark the vital sense to be
<A NAME="760"></A><BR>In the whole body, all one living thing,
<A NAME="761"></A><BR>If of a sudden a force with rapid stroke
<A NAME="762"></A><BR>Should slice it down the middle and cleave in twain,
<A NAME="763"></A><BR>Beyond a doubt likewise the soul itself,
<A NAME="764"></A><BR>Divided, dissevered, asunder will be flung
<A NAME="765"></A><BR>Along with body. But what severed is
<A NAME="766"></A><BR>And into sundry parts divides, indeed
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>Admits it owns no everlasting nature.
<A NAME="768"></A><BR>We hear how chariots of war, areek
<A NAME="769"></A><BR>With hurly slaughter, lop with flashing scythes
<A NAME="770"></A><BR>The limbs away so suddenly that there,
<A NAME="771"></A><BR>Fallen from the trunk, they quiver on the earth,
<A NAME="772"></A><BR>The while the mind and powers of the man
<A NAME="773"></A><BR>Can feel no pain, for swiftness of his hurt,
<A NAME="774"></A><BR>And sheer abandon in the zest of battle:
<A NAME="775"></A><BR>With the remainder of his frame he seeks
<A NAME="776"></A><BR>Anew the battle and the slaughter, nor marks
<A NAME="777"></A><BR>How the swift wheels and scythes of ravin have dragged
<A NAME="778"></A><BR>Off with the horses his left arm and shield;
<A NAME="779"></A><BR>Nor other how his right has dropped away,
<A NAME="780"></A><BR>Mounting again and on. A third attempts
<A NAME="781"></A><BR>With leg dismembered to arise and stand,
<A NAME="782"></A><BR>Whilst, on the ground hard by, the dying foot
<A NAME="783"></A><BR>Twitches its spreading toes. And even the head,
<A NAME="784"></A><BR>When from the warm and living trunk lopped off,
<A NAME="785"></A><BR>Keeps on the ground the vital countenance
<A NAME="786"></A><BR>And open eyes, until 't has rendered up
<A NAME="787"></A><BR>All remnants of the soul. Nay, once again:
<A NAME="788"></A><BR>If, when a serpent's darting forth its tongue,
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>And lashing its tail, thou gettest chance to hew
<A NAME="790"></A><BR>With axe its length of trunk to many parts,
<A NAME="791"></A><BR>Thou'lt see each severed fragment writhing round
<A NAME="792"></A><BR>With its fresh wound, and spattering up the sod,
<A NAME="793"></A><BR>And there the fore-part seeking with the jaws
<A NAME="794"></A><BR>After the hinder, with bite to stop the pain.
<A NAME="795"></A><BR>So shall we say that these be souls entire
<A NAME="796"></A><BR>In all those fractions?- but from that 'twould follow
<A NAME="797"></A><BR>One creature'd have in body many souls.
<A NAME="798"></A><BR>Therefore, the soul, which was indeed but one,
<A NAME="799"></A><BR>Has been divided with the body too:
<A NAME="800"></A><BR>Each is but mortal, since alike is each
<A NAME="801"></A><BR>Hewn into many parts. Again, how often
<A NAME="802"></A><BR>We view our fellow going by degrees,
<A NAME="803"></A><BR>And losing limb by limb the vital sense;
<A NAME="804"></A><BR>First nails and fingers of the feet turn blue,
<A NAME="805"></A><BR>Next die the feet and legs, then o'er the rest
<A NAME="806"></A><BR>Slow crawl the certain footsteps of cold death.
<A NAME="807"></A><BR>And since this nature of the soul is torn,
<A NAME="808"></A><BR>Nor mounts away, as at one time, entire,
<A NAME="809"></A><BR>We needs must hold it mortal. But perchance
<A NAME="810"></A><BR>If thou supposest that the soul itself
<A NAME="811"></A><BR>Can inward draw along the frame, and bring
<A NAME="812"></A><BR>Its parts together to one place, and so
<A NAME="813"></A><BR>From all the members draw the sense away,
<A NAME="814"></A><BR>Why, then, that place in which such stock of soul
<A NAME="815"></A><BR>Collected is, should greater seem in sense.
<A NAME="816"></A><BR>But since such place is nowhere, for a fact,
<A NAME="817"></A><BR>As said before, 'tis rent and scattered forth,
<A NAME="818"></A><BR>And so goes under. Or again, if now
<A NAME="819"></A><BR>I please to grant the false, and say that soul
<A NAME="820"></A><BR>Can thus be lumped within the frames of those
<A NAME="821"></A><BR>Who leave the sunshine, dying bit by bit,
<A NAME="822"></A><BR>Still must the soul as mortal be confessed;
<A NAME="823"></A><BR>Nor aught it matters whether to wrack it go,
<A NAME="824"></A><BR>Dispersed in the winds, or, gathered in a mass
<A NAME="825"></A><BR>From all its parts, sink down to brutish death,
<A NAME="826"></A><BR>Since more and more in every region sense
<A NAME="827"></A><BR>Fails the whole man, and less and less of life
<A NAME="828"></A><BR>In every region lingers.
<A NAME="829"></A><BR>And besides,
<A NAME="830"></A><BR>If soul immortal is, and winds its way
<A NAME="831"></A><BR>Into the body at the birth of man,
<A NAME="832"></A><BR>Why can we not remember something, then,
<A NAME="833"></A><BR>Of life-time spent before? why keep we not
<A NAME="834"></A><BR>Some footprints of the things we did of, old?
<A NAME="835"></A><BR>But if so changed hath been the power of mind,
<A NAME="836"></A><BR>That every recollection of things done
<A NAME="837"></A><BR>Is fallen away, at no o'erlong remove
<A NAME="838"></A><BR>Is that, I trow, from what we mean by death.
<A NAME="839"></A><BR>Wherefore 'tis sure that what hath been before
<A NAME="840"></A><BR>Hath died, and what now is is now create.
<A NAME="841"></A><BR>Moreover, if after the body hath been built
<A NAME="842"></A><BR>Our mind's live powers are wont to be put in,
<A NAME="843"></A><BR>Just at the moment that we come to birth,
<A NAME="844"></A><BR>And cross the sills of life, 'twould scarcely fit
<A NAME="845"></A><BR>For them to live as if they seemed to grow
<A NAME="846"></A><BR>Along with limbs and frame, even in the blood,
<A NAME="847"></A><BR>But rather as in a cavern all alone.
<A NAME="848"></A><BR>(Yet all the body duly throngs with sense.)
<A NAME="849"></A><BR>But public fact declares against all this:
<A NAME="850"></A><BR>For soul is so entwined through the veins,
<A NAME="851"></A><BR>The flesh, the thews, the bones, that even the teeth
<A NAME="852"></A><BR>Share in sensation, as proven by dull ache,
<A NAME="853"></A><BR>By twinge from icy water, or grating crunch
<A NAME="854"></A><BR>Upon a stone that got in mouth with bread.
<A NAME="855"></A><BR>Wherefore, again, again, souls must be thought
<A NAME="856"></A><BR>Nor void of birth, nor free from law of death;
<A NAME="857"></A><BR>Nor, if, from outward, in they wound their way,
<A NAME="858"></A><BR>Could they be thought as able so to cleave
<A NAME="859"></A><BR>To these our frames, nor, since so interwove,
<A NAME="860"></A><BR>Appears it that they're able to go forth
<A NAME="861"></A><BR>Unhurt and whole and loose themselves unscathed
<A NAME="862"></A><BR>From all the thews, articulations, bones.
<A NAME="863"></A><BR>But, if perchance thou thinkest that the soul,
<A NAME="864"></A><BR>From outward winding in its way, is wont
<A NAME="865"></A><BR>To seep and soak along these members ours,
<A NAME="866"></A><BR>Then all the more 'twill perish, being thus
<A NAME="867"></A><BR>With body fused- for what will seep and soak
<A NAME="868"></A><BR>Will be dissolved and will therefore die.
<A NAME="869"></A><BR>For just as food, dispersed through all the pores
<A NAME="870"></A><BR>Of body, and passed through limbs and all the frame,
<A NAME="871"></A><BR>Perishes, supplying from itself the stuff
<A NAME="872"></A><BR>For other nature, thus the soul and mind,
<A NAME="873"></A><BR>Though whole and new into a body going,
<A NAME="874"></A><BR>Are yet, by seeping in, dissolved away,
<A NAME="875"></A><BR>Whilst, as through pores, to all the frame there 
<A NAME="876"></A>pass
<A NAME="877"></A><BR>Those particles from which created is
<A NAME="878"></A><BR>This nature of mind, now ruler of our body,
<A NAME="879"></A><BR>Born from that soul which perished, when divided
<A NAME="880"></A><BR>Along the frame. Wherefore it seems that soul
<A NAME="881"></A><BR>Hath both a natal and funeral hour.
<A NAME="882"></A><BR>Besides are seeds of soul there left behind
<A NAME="883"></A><BR>In the breathless body, or not? If there they are,
<A NAME="884"></A><BR>It cannot justly be immortal deemed,
<A NAME="885"></A><BR>Since, shorn of some parts lost, 'thas gone away:
<A NAME="886"></A><BR>But if, borne off with members uncorrupt,
<A NAME="887"></A><BR>'Thas fled so absolutely all away
<A NAME="888"></A><BR>It leaves not one remainder of itself
<A NAME="889"></A><BR>Behind in body, whence do cadavers, then,
<A NAME="890"></A><BR>From out their putrid flesh exhale the worms,
<A NAME="891"></A><BR>And whence does such a mass of living things,
<A NAME="892"></A><BR>Boneless and bloodless, o'er the bloated frame
<A NAME="893"></A><BR>Bubble and swarm? But if perchance thou thinkest
<A NAME="894"></A><BR>That souls from outward into worms can wind,
<A NAME="895"></A><BR>And each into a separate body come,
<A NAME="896"></A><BR>And reckonest not why many thousand souls
<A NAME="897"></A><BR>Collect where only one has gone away,
<A NAME="898"></A><BR>Here is a point, in sooth, that seems to need
<A NAME="899"></A><BR>Inquiry and a putting to the test:
<A NAME="900"></A><BR>Whether the souls go on a hunt for seeds
<A NAME="901"></A><BR>Of worms wherewith to build their dwelling places,
<A NAME="902"></A><BR>Or enter bodies ready-made, as 'twere.
<A NAME="903"></A><BR>But why themselves they thus should do and toil
<A NAME="904"></A><BR>'Tis hard to say, since, being free of body,
<A NAME="905"></A><BR>They flit around, harassed by no disease,
<A NAME="906"></A><BR>Nor cold nor famine; for the body labours
<A NAME="907"></A><BR>By more of kinship to these flaws of life,
<A NAME="908"></A><BR>And mind by contact with that body suffers
<A NAME="909"></A><BR>So many ills. But grant it be for them
<A NAME="910"></A><BR>However useful to construct a body
<A NAME="911"></A><BR>To which to enter in, 'tis plain they can't.
<A NAME="912"></A><BR>Then, souls for self no frames nor bodies make,
<A NAME="913"></A><BR>Nor is there how they once might enter in
<A NAME="914"></A><BR>To bodies ready-made- for they cannot
<A NAME="915"></A><BR>Be nicely interwoven with the same,
<A NAME="916"></A><BR>And there'll be formed no interplay of sense
<A NAME="917"></A><BR>Common to each.
<A NAME="918"></A><BR>Again, why is't there goes
<A NAME="919"></A><BR>Impetuous rage with lion's breed morose,
<A NAME="920"></A><BR>And cunning with foxes, and to deer why given
<A NAME="921"></A><BR>The ancestral fear and tendency to flee,
<A NAME="922"></A><BR>And why in short do all the rest of traits
<A NAME="923"></A><BR>Engender from the very start of life
<A NAME="924"></A><BR>In the members and mentality, if not
<A NAME="925"></A><BR>Because one certain power of mind that came
<A NAME="926"></A><BR>From its own seed and breed waxes the same
<A NAME="927"></A><BR>Along with all the body? But were mind
<A NAME="928"></A><BR>Immortal, were it wont to change its bodies,
<A NAME="929"></A><BR>How topsy-turvy would earth's creatures act!
<A NAME="930"></A><BR>The Hyrcan hound would flee the onset oft
<A NAME="931"></A><BR>Of antlered stag, the scurrying hawk would quake
<A NAME="932"></A><BR>Along the winds of air at the coming dove,
<A NAME="933"></A><BR>And men would dote, and savage beasts be wise;
<A NAME="934"></A><BR>For false the reasoning of those that say
<A NAME="935"></A><BR>Immortal mind is changed by change of body-
<A NAME="936"></A><BR>For what is changed dissolves, and therefore dies.
<A NAME="937"></A><BR>For parts are re-disposed and leave their order;
<A NAME="938"></A><BR>Wherefore they must be also capable
<A NAME="939"></A><BR>Of dissolution through the frame at last,
<A NAME="940"></A><BR>That they along with body perish all.
<A NAME="941"></A><BR>But should some say that always souls of men
<A NAME="942"></A><BR>Go into human bodies, I will ask:
<A NAME="943"></A><BR>How can a wise become a dullard soul?
<A NAME="944"></A><BR>And why is never a child's a prudent soul?
<A NAME="945"></A><BR>And the mare's filly why not trained so well
<A NAME="946"></A><BR>As sturdy strength of steed? We may be sure
<A NAME="947"></A><BR>They'll take their refuge in the thought that mind
<A NAME="948"></A><BR>Becomes a weakling in a weakling frame.
<A NAME="949"></A><BR>Yet be this so, 'tis needful to confess
<A NAME="950"></A><BR>The soul but mortal, since, so altered now
<A NAME="951"></A><BR>Throughout the frame, it loses the life and sense
<A NAME="952"></A><BR>It had before. Or how can mind wax strong
<A NAME="953"></A><BR>Co-equally with body and attain
<A NAME="954"></A><BR>The craved flower of life, unless it be
<A NAME="955"></A><BR>The body's colleague in its origins?
<A NAME="956"></A><BR>Or what's the purport of its going forth
<A NAME="957"></A><BR>From aged limbs?- fears it, perhaps, to stay,
<A NAME="958"></A><BR>Pent in a crumbled body? Or lest its house,
<A NAME="959"></A><BR>Outworn by venerable length of days,
<A NAME="960"></A><BR>May topple down upon it? But indeed
<A NAME="961"></A><BR>For an immortal, perils are there none.
<A NAME="962"></A><BR><BR>Again, at parturitions of the wild
<A NAME="963"></A><BR>And at the rites of Love, that souls should stand
<A NAME="964"></A><BR>Ready hard by seems ludicrous enough-
<A NAME="965"></A><BR>Immortals waiting for their mortal limbs
<A NAME="966"></A><BR>In numbers innumerable, contending madly
<A NAME="967"></A><BR>Which shall be first and chief to enter in!-
<A NAME="968"></A><BR>Unless perchance among the souls there be
<A NAME="969"></A><BR>Such treaties stablished that the first to come
<A NAME="970"></A><BR>Flying along, shall enter in the first,
<A NAME="971"></A><BR>And that they make no rivalries of strength!
<A NAME="972"></A><BR><BR>Again, in ether can't exist a tree,
<A NAME="973"></A><BR>Nor clouds in ocean deeps, nor in the fields
<A NAME="974"></A><BR>Can fishes live, nor blood in timber be,
<A NAME="975"></A><BR>Nor sap in boulders: fixed and arranged
<A NAME="976"></A><BR>Where everything may grow and have its place.
<A NAME="977"></A><BR>Thus nature of mind cannot arise alone
<A NAME="978"></A><BR>Without the body, nor exist afar
<A NAME="979"></A><BR>From thews and blood. But if 'twere possible,
<A NAME="980"></A><BR>Much rather might this very power of mind
<A NAME="981"></A><BR>Be in the head, the shoulders or the heels,
<A NAME="982"></A><BR>And, born in any part soever, yet
<A NAME="983"></A><BR>In the same man, in the same vessel abide.
<A NAME="984"></A><BR>But since within this body even of ours
<A NAME="985"></A><BR>Stands fixed and appears arranged sure
<A NAME="986"></A><BR>Where soul and mind can each exist and grow,
<A NAME="987"></A><BR>Deny we must the more that they can have
<A NAME="988"></A><BR>Duration and birth, wholly outside the frame.
<A NAME="989"></A><BR>For, verily, the mortal to conjoin
<A NAME="990"></A><BR>With the eternal, and to feign they feel
<A NAME="991"></A><BR>Together, and can function each with each,
<A NAME="992"></A><BR>Is but to dote: for what can be conceived
<A NAME="993"></A><BR>Of more unlike, discrepant, ill-assorted,
<A NAME="994"></A><BR>Than something mortal in a union joined
<A NAME="995"></A><BR>With an immortal and a secular
<A NAME="996"></A><BR>To bear the outrageous tempests?
<A NAME="997"></A><BR>Then, again,
<A NAME="998"></A><BR>Whatever abides eternal must indeed
<A NAME="999"></A><BR>Either repel all strokes, because 'tis made
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR>Of solid body, and permit no entrance
<A NAME="1001"></A><BR>Of aught with power to sunder from within
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR>The parts compact- as are those seeds of stuff
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR>Whose nature we've exhibited before;
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR>Or else be able to endure through time
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR>For this: because they are from blows exempt,
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR>As is the void, the which abides untouched,
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR>Unsmit by any stroke; or else because
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR>There is no room around, whereto things can,
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR>As 'twere, depart in dissolution all,-
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR>Even as the sum of sums eternal is,
<A NAME="1011"></A><BR>Without or place beyond whereto things may
<A NAME="1012"></A><BR>Asunder fly, or bodies which can smite,
<A NAME="1013"></A><BR>And thus dissolve them by the blows of might.
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR>But if perchance the soul's to be adjudged
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR>Immortal, mainly on ground 'tis kept secure
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR>In vital forces- either because there come
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR>Never at all things hostile to its weal,
<A NAME="1018"></A><BR>Or else because what come somehow retire,
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR>Repelled or ere we feel the harm they work,
<A NAME="1020"></A><BR><BR>For, lo, besides that, when the frame's diseased,
<A NAME="1021"></A><BR>Soul sickens too, there cometh, many a time,
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR>That which torments it with the things to be,
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR>Keeps it in dread, and wearies it with cares;
<A NAME="1024"></A><BR>And even when evil acts are of the past,
<A NAME="1025"></A><BR>Still gnaw the old transgressions bitterly.
<A NAME="1026"></A><BR>Add, too, that frenzy, peculiar to the mind,
<A NAME="1027"></A><BR>And that oblivion of the things that were;
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR>Add its submergence in the murky waves
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR>Of drowse and torpor.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1030"></A><B>Folly of the Fear of Death</B>

<A NAME="1031"></A><BR><BR>Therefore death to us
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR>Is nothing, nor concerns us in the least,
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR>Since nature of mind is mortal evermore.
<A NAME="1034"></A><BR>And just as in the ages gone before
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR>We felt no touch of ill, when all sides round
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR>To battle came the Carthaginian host,
<A NAME="1037"></A><BR>And the times, shaken by tumultuous war,
<A NAME="1038"></A><BR>Under the aery coasts of arching heaven
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR>Shuddered and trembled, and all humankind
<A NAME="1040"></A><BR>Doubted to which the empery should fall
<A NAME="1041"></A><BR>By land and sea, thus when we are no more,
<A NAME="1042"></A><BR>When comes that sundering of our body and soul
<A NAME="1043"></A><BR>Through which we're fashioned to a single state,
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR>Verily naught to us, us then no more,
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR>Can come to pass, naught move our senses then-
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR>No, not if earth confounded were with sea,
<A NAME="1047"></A><BR>And sea with heaven. But if indeed do feel
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR>The nature of mind and energy of soul,
<A NAME="1049"></A><BR>After their severance from this body of ours,
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR>Yet nothing 'tis to us who in the bonds
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR>And wedlock of the soul and body live,
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR>Through which we're fashioned to a single state.
<A NAME="1053"></A><BR>And, even if time collected after death
<A NAME="1054"></A><BR>The matter of our frames and set it all
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR>Again in place as now, and if again
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR>To us the light of life were given, O yet
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR>That process too would not concern us aught,
<A NAME="1058"></A><BR>When once the self-succession of our sense
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR>Has been asunder broken. And now and here,
<A NAME="1060"></A><BR>Little enough we're busied with the selves
<A NAME="1061"></A><BR>We were aforetime, nor, concerning them,
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR>Suffer a sore distress. For shouldst thou gaze
<A NAME="1063"></A><BR>Backwards across all yesterdays of time
<A NAME="1064"></A><BR>The immeasurable, thinking how manifold
<A NAME="1065"></A><BR>The motions of matter are, then couldst thou well
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR>Credit this too: often these very seeds
<A NAME="1067"></A><BR>(From which we are to-day) of old were set
<A NAME="1068"></A><BR>In the same order as they are to-day-
<A NAME="1069"></A><BR>Yet this we can't to consciousness recall
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR>Through the remembering mind. For there hath been
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR>An interposed pause of life, and wide
<A NAME="1072"></A><BR>Have all the motions wandered everywhere
<A NAME="1073"></A><BR>From these our senses. For if woe and ail
<A NAME="1074"></A><BR>Perchance are toward, then the man to whom
<A NAME="1075"></A><BR>The bane can happen must himself be there
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR>At that same time. But death precludeth this,
<A NAME="1077"></A><BR>Forbidding life to him on whom might crowd
<A NAME="1078"></A><BR>Such irk and care; and granted 'tis to know:
<A NAME="1079"></A><BR>Nothing for us there is to dread in death,
<A NAME="1080"></A><BR>No wretchedness for him who is no more,
<A NAME="1081"></A><BR>The same estate as if ne'er born before,
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR>When death immortal hath ta'en the mortal life.
<A NAME="1083"></A><BR><BR>Hence, where thou seest a man to grieve because
<A NAME="1084"></A><BR>When dead he rots with body laid away,
<A NAME="1085"></A><BR>Or perishes in flames or jaws of beasts,
<A NAME="1086"></A><BR>Know well: he rings not true, and that beneath
<A NAME="1087"></A><BR>Still works an unseen sting upon his heart,
<A NAME="1088"></A><BR>However he deny that he believes.
<A NAME="1089"></A><BR>His shall be aught of feeling after death.
<A NAME="1090"></A><BR>For he, I fancy, grants not what he says,
<A NAME="1091"></A><BR>Nor what that presupposes, and he fails
<A NAME="1092"></A><BR>To pluck himself with all his roots from life
<A NAME="1093"></A><BR>And cast that self away, quite unawares
<A NAME="1094"></A><BR>Feigning that some remainder's left behind.
<A NAME="1095"></A><BR>For when in life one pictures to oneself
<A NAME="1096"></A><BR>His body dead by beasts and vultures torn,
<A NAME="1097"></A><BR>He pities his state, dividing not himself
<A NAME="1098"></A><BR>Therefrom, removing not the self enough
<A NAME="1099"></A><BR>From the body flung away, imagining
<A NAME="1100"></A><BR>Himself that body, and projecting there
<A NAME="1101"></A><BR>His own sense, as he stands beside it: hence
<A NAME="1102"></A><BR>He grieves that he is mortal born, nor marks
<A NAME="1103"></A><BR>That in true death there is no second self
<A NAME="1104"></A><BR>Alive and able to sorrow for self destroyed,
<A NAME="1105"></A><BR>Or stand lamenting that the self lies there
<A NAME="1106"></A><BR>Mangled or burning. For if it an evil is
<A NAME="1107"></A><BR>Dead to be jerked about by jaw and fang
<A NAME="1108"></A><BR>Of the wild brutes, I see not why 'twere not
<A NAME="1109"></A><BR>Bitter to lie on fires and roast in flames,
<A NAME="1110"></A><BR>Or suffocate in honey, and, reclined
<A NAME="1111"></A><BR>On the smooth oblong of an icy slab,
<A NAME="1112"></A><BR>Grow stiff in cold, or sink with load of earth
<A NAME="1113"></A><BR>Down-crushing from above.
<A NAME="1114"></A><BR>"Thee now no more
<A NAME="1115"></A><BR>The joyful house and best of wives shall welcome,
<A NAME="1116"></A><BR>Nor little sons run up to snatch their kisses
<A NAME="1117"></A><BR>And touch with silent happiness thy heart.
<A NAME="1118"></A><BR>Thou shalt not speed in undertakings more,
<A NAME="1119"></A><BR>Nor be the warder of thine own no more.
<A NAME="1120"></A><BR>Poor wretch," they say, "one hostile hour hath ta'en
<A NAME="1121"></A><BR>Wretchedly from thee all life's many guerdons,"
<A NAME="1122"></A><BR>But add not, "yet no longer unto thee
<A NAME="1123"></A><BR>Remains a remnant of desire for them"
<A NAME="1124"></A><BR>If this they only well perceived with mind
<A NAME="1125"></A><BR>And followed up with maxims, they would free
<A NAME="1126"></A><BR>Their state of man from anguish and from fear.
<A NAME="1127"></A><BR>"O even as here thou art, aslumber in death,
<A NAME="1128"></A><BR>So shalt thou slumber down the rest of time,
<A NAME="1129"></A><BR>Released from every harrying pang. But we,
<A NAME="1130"></A><BR>We have bewept thee with insatiate woe,
<A NAME="1131"></A><BR>Standing beside whilst on the awful pyre
<A NAME="1132"></A><BR>Thou wert made ashes; and no day shall take
<A NAME="1133"></A><BR>For us the eternal sorrow from the breast."
<A NAME="1134"></A><BR>But ask the mourner what's the bitterness
<A NAME="1135"></A><BR>That man should waste in an eternal grief,
<A NAME="1136"></A><BR>If, after all, the thing's but sleep and rest?
<A NAME="1137"></A><BR>For when the soul and frame together are sunk
<A NAME="1138"></A><BR>In slumber, no one then demands his self
<A NAME="1139"></A><BR>Or being. Well, this sleep may be forever,
<A NAME="1140"></A><BR>Without desire of any selfhood more,
<A NAME="1141"></A><BR>For all it matters unto us asleep.
<A NAME="1142"></A><BR>Yet not at all do those primordial germs
<A NAME="1143"></A><BR>Roam round our members, at that time, afar
<A NAME="1144"></A><BR>From their own motions that produce our senses-
<A NAME="1145"></A><BR>Since, when he's startled from his sleep, a man
<A NAME="1146"></A><BR>Collects his senses. Death is, then, to us
<A NAME="1147"></A><BR>Much less- if there can be a less than that
<A NAME="1148"></A><BR>Which is itself a nothing: for there comes
<A NAME="1149"></A><BR>Hard upon death a scattering more great
<A NAME="1150"></A><BR>Of the throng of matter, and no man wakes up
<A NAME="1151"></A><BR>On whom once falls the icy pause of life.
<A NAME="1152"></A><BR>This too, O often from the soul men say,
<A NAME="1153"></A><BR>Along their couches holding of the cups,
<A NAME="1154"></A><BR>With faces shaded by fresh wreaths awry:
<A NAME="1155"></A><BR>"Brief is this fruit of joy to paltry man,
<A NAME="1156"></A><BR>Soon, soon departed, and thereafter, no,
<A NAME="1157"></A><BR>It may not be recalled."- As if, forsooth,
<A NAME="1158"></A><BR>It were their prime of evils in great death
<A NAME="1159"></A><BR>To parch, poor tongues, with thirst and arid drought,
<A NAME="1160"></A><BR>Or chafe for any lack.
<A NAME="1161"></A><BR>Once more, if Nature
<A NAME="1162"></A><BR>Should of a sudden send a voice abroad,
<A NAME="1163"></A><BR>And her own self inveigh against us so:
<A NAME="1164"></A><BR>"Mortal, what hast thou of such grave concern
<A NAME="1165"></A><BR>That thou indulgest in too sickly plaints?
<A NAME="1166"></A><BR>Why this bemoaning and beweeping death?
<A NAME="1167"></A><BR>For if thy life aforetime and behind
<A NAME="1168"></A><BR>To thee was grateful, and not all thy good
<A NAME="1169"></A><BR>Was heaped as in sieve to flow away
<A NAME="1170"></A><BR>And perish unavailingly, why not,
<A NAME="1171"></A><BR>Even like a banqueter, depart the halls,
<A NAME="1172"></A><BR>Laden with life? why not with mind content
<A NAME="1173"></A><BR>Take now, thou fool, thy unafflicted rest?
<A NAME="1174"></A><BR>But if whatever thou enjoyed hath been
<A NAME="1175"></A><BR>Lavished and lost, and life is now offence,
<A NAME="1176"></A><BR>Why seekest more to add- which in its turn
<A NAME="1177"></A><BR>Will perish foully and fall out in vain?
<A NAME="1178"></A><BR>O why not rather make an end of life,
<A NAME="1179"></A><BR>Of labour? For all I may devise or find
<A NAME="1180"></A><BR>To pleasure thee is nothing: all things are
<A NAME="1181"></A><BR>The same forever. Though not yet thy body
<A NAME="1182"></A><BR>Wrinkles with years, nor yet the frame exhausts
<A NAME="1183"></A><BR>Outworn, still things abide the same, even if
<A NAME="1184"></A><BR>Thou goest on to conquer all of time
<A NAME="1185"></A><BR>With length of days, yea, if thou never diest"-
<A NAME="1186"></A><BR>What were our answer, but that Nature here
<A NAME="1187"></A><BR>Urges just suit and in her words lays down
<A NAME="1188"></A><BR>True cause of action? Yet should one complain,
<A NAME="1189"></A><BR>Riper in years and elder, and lament,
<A NAME="1190"></A><BR>Poor devil, his death more sorely than is fit,
<A NAME="1191"></A><BR>Then would she not, with greater right, on him
<A NAME="1192"></A><BR>Cry out, inveighing with a voice more shrill:
<A NAME="1193"></A><BR>"Off with thy tears, and choke thy whines, buffoon!
<A NAME="1194"></A><BR>Thou wrinklest- after thou hast had the sum
<A NAME="1195"></A><BR>Of the guerdons of life; yet, since thou cravest 
<A NAME="1196"></A>ever
<A NAME="1197"></A><BR>What's not at hand, contemning present good,
<A NAME="1198"></A><BR>That life has slipped away, unperfected
<A NAME="1199"></A><BR>And unavailing unto thee. And now,
<A NAME="1200"></A><BR>Or ere thou guessed it, death beside thy head
<A NAME="1201"></A><BR>Stands- and before thou canst be going home
<A NAME="1202"></A><BR>Sated and laden with the goodly feast.
<A NAME="1203"></A><BR>But now yield all that's alien to thine age,-
<A NAME="1204"></A><BR>Up, with good grace! make room for sons: thou must."
<A NAME="1205"></A><BR>Justly, I fancy, would she reason thus,
<A NAME="1206"></A><BR>Justly inveigh and gird: since ever the old
<A NAME="1207"></A><BR>Outcrowded by the new gives way, and ever
<A NAME="1208"></A><BR>The one thing from the others is repaired.
<A NAME="1209"></A><BR>Nor no man is consigned to the abyss
<A NAME="1210"></A><BR>Of Tartarus, the black. For stuff must be,
<A NAME="1211"></A><BR>That thus the after-generations grow,-
<A NAME="1212"></A><BR>Though these, their life completed, follow thee;
<A NAME="1213"></A><BR>And thus like thee are generations all-
<A NAME="1214"></A><BR>Already fallen, or some time to fall.
<A NAME="1215"></A><BR>So one thing from another rises ever;
<A NAME="1216"></A><BR>And in fee-simple life is given to none,
<A NAME="1217"></A><BR>But unto all mere usufruct.
<A NAME="1218"></A><BR>Look back:
<A NAME="1219"></A><BR>Nothing to us was all fore-passed eld
<A NAME="1220"></A><BR>Of time the eternal, ere we had a birth.
<A NAME="1221"></A><BR>And Nature holds this like a mirror up
<A NAME="1222"></A><BR>Of time-to-be when we are dead and gone.
<A NAME="1223"></A><BR>And what is there so horrible appears?
<A NAME="1224"></A><BR>Now what is there so sad about it all?
<A NAME="1225"></A><BR>Is't not serener far than any sleep?
<A NAME="1226"></A><BR>And, verily, those tortures said to be
<A NAME="1227"></A><BR>In Acheron, the deep, they all are ours
<A NAME="1228"></A><BR>Here in this life. No Tantalus, benumbed
<A NAME="1229"></A><BR>With baseless terror, as the fables tell,
<A NAME="1230"></A><BR>Fears the huge boulder hanging in the air:
<A NAME="1231"></A><BR>But, rather, in life an empty dread of gods
<A NAME="1232"></A><BR>Urges mortality, and each one fears
<A NAME="1233"></A><BR>Such fall of fortune as may chance to him.
<A NAME="1234"></A><BR>Nor eat the vultures into Tityus
<A NAME="1235"></A><BR>Prostrate in Acheron, nor can they find,
<A NAME="1236"></A><BR>Forsooth, throughout eternal ages, aught
<A NAME="1237"></A><BR>To pry around for in that mighty breast.
<A NAME="1238"></A><BR>However hugely he extend his bulk-
<A NAME="1239"></A><BR>Who hath for outspread limbs not acres nine,
<A NAME="1240"></A><BR>But the whole earth- he shall not able be
<A NAME="1241"></A><BR>To bear eternal pain nor furnish food
<A NAME="1242"></A><BR>From his own frame forever. But for us
<A NAME="1243"></A><BR>A Tityus is he whom vultures rend
<A NAME="1244"></A><BR>Prostrate in love, whom anxious anguish eats,
<A NAME="1245"></A><BR>Whom troubles of any unappeased desires
<A NAME="1246"></A><BR>Asunder rip. We have before our eyes
<A NAME="1247"></A><BR>Here in this life also a Sisyphus
<A NAME="1248"></A><BR>In him who seeketh of the populace
<A NAME="1249"></A><BR>The rods, the axes fell, and evermore
<A NAME="1250"></A><BR>Retires a beaten and a gloomy man.
<A NAME="1251"></A><BR>For to seek after power- an empty name,
<A NAME="1252"></A><BR>Nor given at all- and ever in the search
<A NAME="1253"></A><BR>To endure a world of toil, O this it is
<A NAME="1254"></A><BR>To shove with shoulder up the hill a stone
<A NAME="1255"></A><BR>Which yet comes rolling back from off the top,
<A NAME="1256"></A><BR>And headlong makes for levels of the plain.
<A NAME="1257"></A><BR>Then to be always feeding an ingrate mind,
<A NAME="1258"></A><BR>Filling with good things, satisfying never-
<A NAME="1259"></A><BR>As do the seasons of the year for us,
<A NAME="1260"></A><BR>When they return and bring their progenies
<A NAME="1261"></A><BR>And varied charms, and we are never filled
<A NAME="1262"></A><BR>With the fruits of life- O this, I fancy, 'tis
<A NAME="1263"></A><BR>To pour, like those young virgins in the tale,
<A NAME="1264"></A><BR>Waters into a sieve, unfilled forever.
<A NAME="1265"></A><BR><BR>Cerberus and Furies, and that Lack of Light
<A NAME="1266"></A><BR><BR>Tartarus, out-belching from his mouth the surge
<A NAME="1267"></A><BR>Of horrible heat- the which are nowhere, nor
<A NAME="1268"></A><BR>Indeed can be: but in this life is fear
<A NAME="1269"></A><BR>Of retributions just and expiations
<A NAME="1270"></A><BR>For evil acts: the dungeon and the leap
<A NAME="1271"></A><BR>From that dread rock of infamy, the stripes,
<A NAME="1272"></A><BR>The executioners, the oaken rack,
<A NAME="1273"></A><BR>The iron plates, bitumen, and the torch.
<A NAME="1274"></A><BR>And even though these are absent, yet the mind,
<A NAME="1275"></A><BR>With a fore-fearing conscience, plies its goads
<A NAME="1276"></A><BR>And burns beneath the lash, nor sees meanwhile
<A NAME="1277"></A><BR>What terminus of ills, what end of pine
<A NAME="1278"></A><BR>Can ever be, and feareth lest the same
<A NAME="1279"></A><BR>But grow more heavy after death. Of truth,
<A NAME="1280"></A><BR>The life of fools is Acheron on earth.
<A NAME="1281"></A><BR>This also to thy very self sometimes
<A NAME="1282"></A><BR>Repeat thou mayst: "Lo, even good Ancus left
<A NAME="1283"></A><BR>The sunshine with his eyes, in divers things
<A NAME="1284"></A><BR>A better man than thou, O worthless hind;
<A NAME="1285"></A><BR>And many other kings and lords of rule
<A NAME="1286"></A><BR>Thereafter have gone under, once who swayed
<A NAME="1287"></A><BR>O'er mighty peoples. And he also, he-
<A NAME="1288"></A><BR>Who whilom paved a highway down the sea,
<A NAME="1289"></A><BR>And gave his legionaries thoroughfare
<A NAME="1290"></A><BR>Along the deep, and taught them how to cross
<A NAME="1291"></A><BR>The pools of brine afoot, and did contemn,
<A NAME="1292"></A><BR>Trampling upon it with his cavalry,
<A NAME="1293"></A><BR>The bellowings of ocean- poured his soul
<A NAME="1294"></A><BR>From dying body, as his light was ta'en.
<A NAME="1295"></A><BR>And Scipio's son, the thunderbolt of war,
<A NAME="1296"></A><BR>Horror of Carthage, gave his bones to earth,
<A NAME="1297"></A><BR>Like to the lowliest villein in the house.
<A NAME="1298"></A><BR>Add finders-out of sciences and arts;
<A NAME="1299"></A><BR>Add comrades of the Heliconian dames,
<A NAME="1300"></A><BR>Among whom Homer, sceptered o'er them all
<A NAME="1301"></A><BR>Now lies in slumber sunken with the rest.
<A NAME="1302"></A><BR>Then, too, Democritus, when ripened eld
<A NAME="1303"></A><BR>Admonished him his memory waned away,
<A NAME="1304"></A><BR>Of own accord offered his head to death.
<A NAME="1305"></A><BR>Even Epicurus went, his light of life
<A NAME="1306"></A><BR>Run out, the man in genius who o'er-topped
<A NAME="1307"></A><BR>The human race, extinguishing all others,
<A NAME="1308"></A><BR>As sun, in ether arisen, all the stars.
<A NAME="1309"></A><BR>Wilt thou, then, dally, thou complain to go?-
<A NAME="1310"></A><BR>For whom already life's as good as dead,
<A NAME="1311"></A><BR>Whilst yet thou livest and lookest?- who in sleep
<A NAME="1312"></A><BR>Wastest thy life- time's major part, and snorest
<A NAME="1313"></A><BR>Even when awake, and ceasest not to see
<A NAME="1314"></A><BR>The stuff of dreams, and bearest a mind beset
<A NAME="1315"></A><BR>By baseless terror, nor discoverest oft
<A NAME="1316"></A><BR>What's wrong with thee, when, like a sotted wretch,
<A NAME="1317"></A><BR>Thou'rt jostled along by many crowding cares,
<A NAME="1318"></A><BR>And wanderest reeling round, with mind aswim."
<A NAME="1319"></A><BR>If men, in that same way as on the mind
<A NAME="1320"></A><BR>They feel the load that wearies with its weight,
<A NAME="1321"></A><BR>Could also know the causes whence it comes,
<A NAME="1322"></A><BR>And why so great the heap of ill on heart,
<A NAME="1323"></A><BR>O not in this sort would they live their life,
<A NAME="1324"></A><BR>As now so much we see them, knowing not
<A NAME="1325"></A><BR>What 'tis they want, and seeking ever and ever
<A NAME="1326"></A><BR>A change of place, as if to drop the burden.
<A NAME="1327"></A><BR>The man who sickens of his home goes out,
<A NAME="1328"></A><BR>Forth from his splendid halls, and straight- returns,
<A NAME="1329"></A><BR>Feeling i'faith no better off abroad.
<A NAME="1330"></A><BR>He races, driving his Gallic ponies along,
<A NAME="1331"></A><BR>Down to his villa, madly,- as in haste
<A NAME="1332"></A><BR>To hurry help to a house afire.- At once
<A NAME="1333"></A><BR>He yawns, as soon as foot has touched the threshold,
<A NAME="1334"></A><BR>Or drowsily goes off in sleep and seeks
<A NAME="1335"></A><BR>Forgetfulness, or maybe bustles about
<A NAME="1336"></A><BR>And makes for town again. In such a way
<A NAME="1337"></A><BR>Each human flees himself- a self in sooth,
<A NAME="1338"></A><BR>As happens, he by no means can escape;
<A NAME="1339"></A><BR>And willy-nilly he cleaves to it and loathes,
<A NAME="1340"></A><BR>Sick, sick, and guessing not the cause of ail.
<A NAME="1341"></A><BR>Yet should he see but that, O chiefly then,
<A NAME="1342"></A><BR>Leaving all else, he'd study to divine
<A NAME="1343"></A><BR>The nature of things, since here is in debate
<A NAME="1344"></A><BR>Eternal time and not the single hour,
<A NAME="1345"></A><BR>Mortal's estate in whatsoever remains
<A NAME="1346"></A><BR>After great death.
<A NAME="1347"></A><BR>And too, when all is said,
<A NAME="1348"></A><BR>What evil lust of life is this so great
<A NAME="1349"></A><BR>Subdues us to live, so dreadfully distraught
<A NAME="1350"></A><BR>In perils and alarms? one fixed end
<A NAME="1351"></A><BR>Of life abideth for mortality;
<A NAME="1352"></A><BR>Death's not to shun, and we must go to meet.
<A NAME="1353"></A><BR>Besides we're busied with the same devices,
<A NAME="1354"></A><BR>Ever and ever, and we are at them ever,
<A NAME="1355"></A><BR>And there's no new delight that may be forged
<A NAME="1356"></A><BR>By living on. But whilst the thing we long for
<A NAME="1357"></A><BR>Is lacking, that seems good above all else;
<A NAME="1358"></A><BR>Thereafter, when we've touched it, something else
<A NAME="1359"></A><BR>We long for; ever one equal thirst of life
<A NAME="1360"></A><BR>Grips us agape. And doubtful 'tis what fortune
<A NAME="1361"></A><BR>The future times may carry, or what be
<A NAME="1362"></A><BR>That chance may bring, or what the issue next
<A NAME="1363"></A><BR>Awaiting us. Nor by prolonging life
<A NAME="1364"></A><BR>Take we the least away from death's own time,
<A NAME="1365"></A><BR>Nor can we pluck one moment off, whereby
<A NAME="1366"></A><BR>To minish the aeons of our state of death.
<A NAME="1367"></A><BR>Therefore, O man, by living on, fulfil
<A NAME="1368"></A><BR>As many generations as thou may:
<A NAME="1369"></A><BR>Eternal death shall there be waiting still;
<A NAME="1370"></A><BR>And he who died with light of yesterday
<A NAME="1371"></A><BR>Shall be no briefer time in death's No-more
<A NAME="1372"></A><BR>Than he who perished months or years before.
