<A NAME="10"></A><B>Proem</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>'Twas Athens first, the glorious in name,
<A NAME="12"></A><BR>That whilom gave to hapless sons of men
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>The sheaves of harvest, and re-ordered life,
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>And decreed laws; and she the first that gave
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>Life its sweet solaces, when she begat
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>A man of heart so wise, who whilom poured
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>All wisdom forth from his truth-speaking mouth;
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>The glory of whom, though dead, is yet to-day,
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>Because of those discoveries divine
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>Renowned of old, exalted to the sky.
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>For when saw he that well-nigh everything
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>Which needs of man most urgently require
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>Was ready to hand for mortals, and that life,
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>As far as might be, was established safe,
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>That men were lords in riches, honour, praise,
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>And eminent in goodly fame of sons,
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>And that they yet, O yet, within the home,
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>Still had the anxious heart which vexed life
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>Unpausingly with torments of the mind,
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>And raved perforce with angry plaints, then he,
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>Then he, the master, did perceive that 'twas
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>The vessel itself which worked the bane, and all,
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>However wholesome, which from here or there
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>Was gathered into it, was by that bane
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>Spoilt from within- in part, because he saw
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>The vessel so cracked and leaky that nowise
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>'Tcould ever be filled to brim; in part because
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>He marked how it polluted with foul taste
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>Whate'er it got within itself. So he,
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>The master, then by his truth-speaking words,
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>Purged the breasts of men, and set the bounds
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>Of lust and terror, and exhibited
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>The supreme good whither we all endeavour,
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>And showed the path whereby we might arrive
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>Thereunto by a little cross-cut straight,
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>And what of ills in all affairs of mortals
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>Upsprang and flitted deviously about
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>(Whether by chance or force), since Nature thus
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>Had destined; and from out what gates a man
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>Should sally to each combat. And he proved
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>That mostly vainly doth the human race
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>Roll in its bosom the grim waves of care.
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>For just as children tremble and fear all
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>In the viewless dark, so even we at times
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>Dread in the light so many things that be
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>No whit more fearsome than what children feign,
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>Shuddering, will be upon them in the dark.
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>This terror then, this darkness of the mind,
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>Not sunrise with its flaring spokes of light,
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>Nor glittering arrows of morning can disperse,
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>But only Nature's aspect and her law.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>Wherefore the more will I go on to weave
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>In verses this my undertaken task.
<A NAME="64"></A><BR><BR>And since I've taught thee that the world's great 
<A NAME="65"></A>vaults
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>Are mortal and that sky is fashioned
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>Of frame e'en born in time, and whatsoe'er
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>Therein go on and must perforce go on
<A NAME="69"></A><BR><BR>The most I have unravelled; what remains
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>Do thou take in, besides; since once for all
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>To climb into that chariot' renowned
<A NAME="72"></A><BR><BR>Of winds arise; and they appeased are
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>So that all things again...
<A NAME="74"></A><BR><BR>Which were, are changed now, with fury stilled;
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>All other movements through the earth and sky
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>Which mortals gaze upon (O anxious oft
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>In quaking thoughts!), and which abase their minds
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>With dread of deities and press them crushed
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>Down to the earth, because their ignorance
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>Of cosmic causes forces them to yield
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>All things unto the empery of gods
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>And to concede the kingly rule to them.
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>For even those men who have learned full well
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>That godheads lead a long life free of care,
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>If yet meanwhile they wonder by what plan
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>Things can go on (and chiefly yon high things
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>Observed o'erhead on the ethereal coasts),
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>Again are hurried back unto the fears
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>Of old religion and adopt again
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>Harsh masters, deemed almighty,- wretched men,
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>Unwitting what can be and what cannot,
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>And by what law to each its scope prescribed,
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>Its boundary stone that clings so deep in Time.
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>Wherefore the more are they borne wandering on
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>By blindfold reason. And, Memmius, unless
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>From out thy mind thou spewest all of this
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>And casteth far from thee all thoughts which be
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>Unworthy gods and alien to their peace,
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>Then often will the holy majesties
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>Of the high gods be harmful unto thee,
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>As by thy thought degraded,- not, indeed,
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>That essence supreme of gods could be by this
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>So outraged as in wrath to thirst to seek
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>Revenges keen; but even because thyself
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>Thou plaguest with the notion that the gods,
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>Even they, the Calm Ones in serene repose,
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>Do roll the mighty waves of wrath on wrath;
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>Nor wilt thou enter with a serene breast
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>Shrines of the gods; nor wilt thou able be
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>In tranquil peace of mind to take and know
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>Those images which from their holy bodies
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>Are carried into intellects of men,
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>As the announcers of their form divine.
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>What sort of life will follow after this
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>'Tis thine to see. But that afar from us
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>Veriest reason may drive such life away,
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>Much yet remains to be embellished yet
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>In polished verses, albeit hath issued forth
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>So much from me already; lo, there is
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>The law and aspect of the sky to be
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>By reason grasped; there are the tempest times
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>And the bright lightnings to be hymned now-
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>Even what they do and from what cause soe'er
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>They're borne along- that thou mayst tremble not,
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>Marking off regions of prophetic skies
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>For auguries, O foolishly distraught,
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>Even as to whence the flying flame hath come,
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>Or to which half of heaven it turns, or how
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>Through walled places it hath wound its way,
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>Or, after proving its dominion there,
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>How it hath speeded forth from thence amain-
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>Whereof nowise the causes do men know,
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>And think divinities are working there.
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>Do thou, Calliope, ingenious Muse,
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>Solace of mortals and delight of gods,
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>Point out the course before me, as I race
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>On to the white line of the utmost goal,
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>That I may get with signal praise the crown,
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>With thee my guide!
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="140"></A><B>Great Meteorological Phenomena, Etc</B>

<A NAME="141"></A><BR><BR>And so in first place, then
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>With thunder are shaken the blue deeps of heaven,
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>Because the ethereal clouds, scudding aloft,
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>Together clash, what time 'gainst one another
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>The winds are battling. For never a sound there 
<A NAME="146"></A>come
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>From out the serene regions of the sky;
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>But wheresoever in a host more dense
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>The clouds foregather, thence more often comes
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>A crash with mighty rumbling. And, again,
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>Clouds cannot be of so condensed a frame
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>As stones and timbers, nor again so fine
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>As mists and flying smoke; for then perforce
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>They'd either fall, borne down by their brute weight,
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>Like stones, or, like the smoke, they'd powerless 
<A NAME="156"></A>be
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>To keep their mass, or to retain within
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>Frore snows and storms of hail. And they give forth
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>O'er skiey levels of the spreading world
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>A sound on high, as linen-awning, stretched
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>O'er mighty theatres, gives forth at times
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>A cracking roar, when much 'tis beaten about
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>Betwixt the poles and cross-beams. Sometimes, too,
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>Asunder rent by wanton gusts, it raves
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>And imitates the tearing sound of sheets
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>Of paper- even this kind of noise thou mayst
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>In thunder hear- or sound as when winds whirl
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>With lashings and do buffet about in air
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>A hanging cloth and flying paper-sheets.
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>For sometimes, too, it chances that the clouds
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>Cannot together crash head-on, but rather
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>Move side-wise and with motions contrary
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>Graze each the other's body without speed,
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>From whence that dry sound grateth on our ears,
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>So long drawn-out, until the clouds have passed
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>From out their close positions.
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>And, again,
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>In following wise all things seem oft to quake
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>At shock of heavy thunder, and mightiest walls
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>Of the wide reaches of the upper world
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>There on the instant to have sprung apart,
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>Riven asunder, what time a gathered blast
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>Of the fierce hurricane hath all at once
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>Twisted its way into a mass of clouds,
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>And, there enclosed, ever more and more
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>Compelleth by its spinning whirl the cloud
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>To grow all hollow with a thickened crust
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>Surrounding; for thereafter, when the force
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>And the keen onset of the wind have weakened
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>That crust, lo, then the cloud, to-split in twain,
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>Gives forth a hideous crash with bang and boom.
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>No marvel this; since oft a bladder small,
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>Filled up with air, will, when of sudden burst,
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>Give forth a like large sound.
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>There's reason, too,
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>Why clouds make sounds, as through them blow the 
<A NAME="197"></A>winds:
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>We see, borne down the sky, oft shapes of clouds
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>Rough-edged or branched many forky ways;
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>And 'tis the same, as when the sudden flaws
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>Of northwest wind through the dense forest blow,
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>Making the leaves to sough and limbs to crash.
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>It happens too at times that roused force
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>Of the fierce hurricane to-rends the cloud,
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>Breaking right through it by a front assault;
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>For what a blast of wind may do up there
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>Is manifest from facts when here on earth
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>A blast more gentle yet uptwists tall trees
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>And sucks them madly from their deepest roots.
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>Besides, among the clouds are waves, and these
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>Give, as they roughly break, a rumbling roar;
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>As when along deep streams or the great sea
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>Breaks the loud surf. It happens, too, whenever
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>Out from one cloud into another falls
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>The fiery energy of thunderbolt,
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>That straightaway the cloud, if full of wet,
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>Extinguishes the fire with mighty noise;
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>As iron, white from the hot furnaces,
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>Sizzles, when speedily we've plunged its glow
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>Down the cold water. Further, if a cloud
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>More dry receive the fire, 'twill suddenly
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>Kindle to flame and burn with monstrous sound,
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>As if a flame with whirl of winds should range
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>Along the laurel-tressed mountains far,
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>Upburning with its vast assault those trees;
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>Nor is there aught that in the crackling flame
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>Consumes with sound more terrible to man
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>Than Delphic laurel of Apollo lord.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>Oft, too, the multitudinous crash of ice
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>And down-pour of swift hail gives forth a sound
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>Among the mighty clouds on high; for when
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>The wind hath packed them close, each mountain mass
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>Of rain-cloud, there congealed utterly
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>And mixed with hail-stones, breaks and booms...
<A NAME="235"></A><BR><BR>Likewise, it lightens, when the clouds have 
<A NAME="236"></A>struck,
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>By their collision, forth the seeds of fire:
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>As if a stone should smite a stone or steel,
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>For light then too leaps forth and fire then scatters
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>The shining sparks. But with our ears we get
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>The thunder after eyes behold the flash,
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>Because forever things arrive the ears
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>More tardily than the eyes- as thou mayst see
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>From this example too: when markest thou
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>Some man far yonder felling a great tree
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>With double-edged ax, it comes to pass
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>Thine eye beholds the swinging stroke before
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>The blow gives forth a sound athrough thine ears:
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>Thus also we behold the flashing ere
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>We hear the thunder, which discharged is
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>At same time with the fire and by same cause,
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>Born of the same collision.
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>In following wise
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>The clouds suffuse with leaping light the lands,
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>And the storm flashes with tremulous elan:
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>When the wind hath invaded a cloud, and, whirling 
<A NAME="257"></A>there,
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>Hath wrought (as I have shown above) the cloud
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>Into a hollow with a thickened crust,
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>It becomes hot of own velocity:
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>Just as thou seest how motion will o'erheat
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>And set ablaze all objects- verily
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>A leaden ball, hurtling through length of space,
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>Even melts. Therefore, when this same wind a-fire
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>Hath split black cloud, it scatters the fire-seeds,
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>Which, so to say, have been pressed out by force
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>Of sudden from the cloud- and these do make
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>The pulsing flashes of flame; thence followeth
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>The detonation which attacks our ears
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>More tardily than aught which comes along
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>Unto the sight of eyeballs. This takes place-
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>As know thou mayst- at times when clouds are dense
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>And one upon the other piled aloft
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>With wonderful upheavings- nor be thou
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>Deceived because we see how broad their base
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>From underneath, and not how high they tower.
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>For make thine observations at a time
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>When winds shall bear athwart the horizon's blue
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>Clouds like to mountain-ranges moving on,
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>Or when about the sides of mighty peaks
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>Thou seest them one upon the other massed
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>And burdening downward, anchored in high repose,
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>With the winds sepulchred on all sides round:
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>Then canst thou know their mighty masses, then
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>Canst view their caverns, as if builded there
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>Of beetling crags; which, when the hurricanes
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>In gathered storm have filled utterly,
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>Then, prisoned in clouds, they rave around
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>With mighty roarings, and within those dens
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>Bluster like savage beasts, and now from here,
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>And now from there, send growlings through the clouds,
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>And seeking an outlet, whirl themselves about,
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>And roll from 'mid the clouds the seeds of fire,
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>And heap them multitudinously there,
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>And in the hollow furnaces within
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>Wheel flame around, until from bursted cloud
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>In forky flashes they have gleamed forth.
<A NAME="298"></A><BR><BR>Again, from following cause it comes to pass
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>That yon swift golden hue of liquid fire
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>Darts downward to the earth: because the clouds
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>Themselves must hold abundant seeds of fire;
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>For, when they be without all moisture, then
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>They be for most part of a flamy hue
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>And a resplendent. And, indeed, they must
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>Even from the light of sun unto themselves
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>Take multitudinous seeds, and so perforce
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>Redden and pour their bright fires all abroad.
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>And therefore, when the wind hath driven and thrust,
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>Hath forced and squeezed into one spot these clouds,
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>They pour abroad the seeds of fire pressed out,
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>Which make to flash these colours of the flame.
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>Likewise, it lightens also when the clouds
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>Grow rare and thin along the sky; for, when
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>The wind with gentle touch unravels them
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>And breaketh asunder as they move, those seeds
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>Which make the lightnings must by nature fall;
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>At such an hour the horizon lightens round
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>Without the hideous terror of dread noise
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>And skiey uproar.
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>To proceed apace,
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>What sort of nature thunderbolts posses
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>Is by their strokes made manifest and by
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>The brand-marks of their searing heat on things,
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>And by the scorched scars exhaling round
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>The heavy fumes of sulphur. For all these
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>Are marks, O not of wind or rain, but fire.
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>Again, they often enkindle even the roofs
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>Of houses and inside the very rooms
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>With swift flame hold a fierce dominion.
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>Know thou that Nature fashioned this fire
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>Subtler than fires all other, with minute
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>And dartling bodies- a fire 'gainst which there's 
<A NAME="333"></A>naught
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>Can in the least hold out: the thunderbolt,
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>The mighty, passes through the hedging walls
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>Of houses, like to voices or a shout-
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>Through stones, through bronze it passes, and it 
<A NAME="338"></A>melts
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>Upon the instant bronze and gold; and makes,
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>Likewise, the wines sudden to vanish forth,
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>The wine-jars intact- because, ye see,
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>Its heat arriving renders loose and porous
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>Readily all the wine- jar's earthen sides,
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>And winding its way within, it scattereth
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>The elements primordial of the wine
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>With speedy dissolution- process which
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>Even in an age the fiery steam of sun
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>Could not accomplish, however puissant he
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>With his hot coruscations: so much more
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>Agile and overpowering is this force.
<A NAME="351"></A><BR><BR>Now in what manner engendered are these things,
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>How fashioned of such impetuous strength
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>As to cleave towers asunder, and houses all
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>To overtopple, and to wrench apart
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>Timbers and beams, and heroes' monuments
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>To pile in ruins and upheave amain,
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>And to take breath forever out of men,
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>And to o'erthrow the cattle everywhere,-
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>Yes, by what force the lightnings do all this,
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>All this and more, I will unfold to thee,
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>Nor longer keep thee in mere promises.
<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR>The bolts of thunder, then, must be conceived
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>As all begotten in those crasser clouds
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>Up-piled aloft; for, from the sky serene
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>And from the clouds of lighter density,
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>None are sent forth forever. That 'tis so
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>Beyond a doubt, fact plain to sense declares:
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>To wit, at such a time the densed clouds
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>So mass themselves through all the upper air
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>That we might think that round about all murk
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>Had parted forth from Acheron and filled
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>The mighty vaults of sky- so grievously,
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>As gathers thus the storm-clouds' gruesome might,
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>Do faces of black horror hang on high-
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>When tempest begins its thunderbolts to forge.
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>Besides, full often also out at sea
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>A blackest thunderhead, like cataract
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>Of pitch hurled down from heaven, and far away
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>Bulging with murkiness, down on the waves
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>Falls with vast uproar, and draws on amain
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>The darkling tempests big with thunderbolts
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>And hurricanes, itself the while so crammed
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>Tremendously with fires and winds, that even
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>Back on the lands the people shudder round
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>And seek for cover. Therefore, as I said,
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>The storm must be conceived as o'er our head
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>Towering most high; for never would the clouds
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>O'erwhelm the lands with such a massy dark,
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>Unless up-builded heap on lofty heap,
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>To shut the round sun off. Nor could the clouds,
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>As on they come, engulf with rain so vast
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>As thus to make the rivers overflow
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>And fields to float, if ether were not thus
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>Furnished with lofty-piled clouds. Lo, then,
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>Here be all things fulfilled with winds and fires-
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>Hence the long lightnings and the thunders loud.
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>For, verily, I've taught thee even now
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>How cavernous clouds hold seeds innumerable
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>Of fiery exhalations, and they must
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>From off the sunbeams and the heat of these
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>Take many still. And so, when that same wind
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>(Which, haply, into one region of the sky
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>Collects those clouds) hath pressed from out the 
<A NAME="404"></A>same
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>The many fiery seeds, and with that fire
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>Hath at the same time intermixed itself,
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>O then and there that wind, a whirlwind now,
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>Deep in the belly of the cloud spins round
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>In narrow confines, and sharpens there inside
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>In glowing furnaces the thunderbolt.
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>For in a two-fold manner is that wind
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>Enkindled all: it trembles into heat
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>Both by its own velocity and by
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>Repeated touch of fire. Thereafter, when
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>The energy of wind is heated through
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>And the fierce impulse of the fire hath sped
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>Deeply within, O then the thunderbolt,
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>Now ripened, so to say, doth suddenly
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>Splinter the cloud, and the aroused flash
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>Leaps onward, lumining with forky light
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>All places round. And followeth anon
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>A clap so heavy that the skiey vaults,
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>As if asunder burst, seem from on high
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>To engulf the earth. Then fearfully a quake
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>Pervades the lands, and 'long the lofty skies
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>Run the far rumblings. For at such a time
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>Nigh the whole tempest quakes, shook through and 
<A NAME="428"></A>through,
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>And roused are the roarings- from which shock
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>Comes such resounding and abounding rain,
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>That all the murky ether seems to turn
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>Now into rain, and, as it tumbles down,
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>To summon the fields back to primeval floods:
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>So big the rains that be sent down on men
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>By burst of cloud and by the hurricane,
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>What time the thunder-clap, from burning bolt
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>That cracks the cloud, flies forth along. At times
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>The force of wind, excited from without,
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>Smiteth into a cloud already hot
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>With a ripe thunderbolt. And when that wind
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>Hath splintered that cloud, then down there cleaves 
<A NAME="442"></A>forthwith
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>Yon fiery coil of flame which still we call,
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>Even with our fathers' word, a thunderbolt.
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>The same thing haps toward every other side
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>Whither that force hath swept. It happens, too,
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>That sometimes force of wind, though hurtled forth
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>Without all fire, yet in its voyage through space
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>Igniteth, whilst it comes along, along-
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>Losing some larger bodies which cannot
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>Pass, like the others, through the bulks of air-
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>And, scraping together out of air itself
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>Some smaller bodies, carries them along,
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>And these, commingling, by their flight make fire:
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>Much in the manner as oft a leaden ball
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>Grows hot upon its aery course, the while
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>It loseth many bodies of stark cold
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>And taketh into itself along the air
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>New particles of fire. It happens, too,
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>That force of blow itself arouses fire,
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>When force of wind, a-cold and hurtled forth
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>Without all fire, hath strook somewhere amain-
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>No marvel, because, when with terrific stroke
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>'Thas smitten, the elements of fiery-stuff
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>Can stream together from out the very wind
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>And, simultaneously, from out that thing
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>Which then and there receives the stroke: as flies
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>The fire when with the steel we hack the stone;
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>Nor yet, because the force of steel's a-cold,
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>Rush the less speedily together there
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>Under the stroke its seeds of radiance hot.
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>And therefore, thuswise must an object too
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>Be kindled by a thunderbolt, if haply
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>'Thas been adapt and suited to the flames.
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>Yet force of wind must not be rashly deemed
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>As altogether and entirely cold-
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>That force which is discharged from on high
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>With such stupendous power; but if 'tis not
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>Upon its course already kindled with fire,
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>It yet arriveth warmed and mixed with heat.
<A NAME="481"></A><BR><BR>And, now, the speed and stroke of thunderbolt
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>Is so tremendous, and with glide so swift
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>Those thunderbolts rush on and down, because
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>Their roused force itself collects itself
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>First always in the clouds, and then prepares
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>For the huge effort of their going-forth;
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>Next, when the cloud no longer can retain
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>The increment of their fierce impetus,
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>Their force is pressed out, and therefore flies
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>With impetus so wondrous, like to shots
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>Hurled from the powerful Roman catapults.
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>Note, too, this force consists of elements
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>Both small and smooth, nor is there aught that can
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>With ease resist such nature. For it darts
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>Between and enters through the pores of things;
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>And so it never falters in delay
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>Despite innumerable collisions, but
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>Flies shooting onward with a swift elan.
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>Next, since by nature always every weight
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>Bears downward, doubled is the swiftness then
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>And that elan is still more wild and dread,
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>When, verily, to weight are added blows,
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>So that more madly and more fiercely then
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>The thunderbolt shakes into shivers all
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>That blocks its path, following on its way.
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>Then, too, because it comes along, along
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>With one continuing elan, it must
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>Take on velocity anew, anew,
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>Which still increases as it goes, and ever
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>Augments the bolt's vast powers and to the blow
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>Gives larger vigour; for it forces all,
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>All of the thunder's seeds of fire, to sweep
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>In a straight line unto one place, as 'twere,-
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>Casting them one by other, as they roll,
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>Into that onward course. Again, perchance,
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>In coming along, it pulls from out the air
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>Some certain bodies, which by their own blows
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>Enkindle its velocity. And, lo,
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>It comes through objects leaving them unharmed,
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>It goes through many things and leaves them whole,
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>Because the liquid fire flieth along
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>Athrough their pores. And much it does transfix,
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>When these primordial atoms of the bolt
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>Have fallen upon the atoms of these things
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>Precisely where the intertwined atoms
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>Are held together. And, further, easily
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>Brass it unbinds and quickly fuseth gold,
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>Because its force is so minutely made
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>Of tiny parts and elements so smooth
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>That easily they wind their way within,
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>And, when once in, quickly unbind all knots
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>And loosen all the bonds of union there.
<A NAME="533"></A><BR><BR>And most in autumn is shaken the house of heaven,
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>The house so studded with the glittering stars,
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>And the whole earth around- most too in spring
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>When flowery times unfold themselves: for, lo,
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>In the cold season is there lack of fire,
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>And winds are scanty in the hot, and clouds
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>Have not so dense a bulk. But when, indeed,
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>The seasons of heaven are betwixt these twain,
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>The divers causes of the thunderbolt
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>Then all concur; for then both cold and heat
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>Are mixed in the cross-seas of the year,
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>So that a discord rises among things
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>And air in vast tumultuosity
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>Billows, infuriate with the fires and winds-
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>Of which the both are needed by the cloud
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>For fabrication of the thunderbolt.
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>For the first part of heat and last of cold
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>Is the time of spring; wherefore must things unlike
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>Do battle one with other, and, when mixed,
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>Tumultuously rage. And when rolls round
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>The latest heat mixed with the earliest chill-
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>The time which bears the name of autumn- then
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>Likewise fierce cold-spells wrestle with fierce 
<A NAME="556"></A>heats.
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>On this account these seasons of the year
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>Are nominated "cross-seas."- And no marvel
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>If in those times the thunderbolts prevail
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>And storms are roused turbulent in heaven,
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>Since then both sides in dubious warfare rage
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>Tumultuously, the one with flames, the other
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>With winds and with waters mixed with winds.
<A NAME="564"></A><BR><BR>This, this it is, O Memmius, to see through
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>The very nature of fire-fraught thunderbolt;
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>O this it is to mark by what blind force
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>It maketh each effect, and not, O not
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>To unwind Etrurian scrolls oracular,
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>Inquiring tokens of occult will of gods,
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>Even as to whence the flying flame hath come,
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>Or to which half of heaven it turns, or how
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>Through walled places it hath wound its way,
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>Or, after proving its dominion there,
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>How it hath speeded forth from thence amain,
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>Or what the thunderstroke portends of ill
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>From out high heaven. But if Jupiter
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>And other gods shake those refulgent vaults
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>With dread reverberations and hurl fire
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>Whither it pleases each, why smite they not
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>Mortals of reckless and revolting crimes,
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>That such may pant from a transpierced breast
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>Forth flames of the red levin- unto men
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>A drastic lesson?- why is rather he-
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>O he self-conscious of no foul offence-
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>Involved in flames, though innocent, and clasped
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>Up-caught in skiey whirlwind and in fire?
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>Nay, why, then, aim they at eternal wastes,
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>And spend themselves in vain?- perchance, even so
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>To exercise their arms and strengthen shoulders?
<A NAME="590"></A><BR>Why suffer they the Father's javelin
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>To be so blunted on the earth? And why
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>Doth he himself allow it, nor spare the same
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>Even for his enemies? O why most oft
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>Aims he at lofty places? Why behold we
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>Marks of his lightnings most on mountain tops?
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>Then for what reason shoots he at the sea?-
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>What sacrilege have waves and bulk of brine
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>And floating fields of foam been guilty of?
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>Besides, if 'tis his will that we beware
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>Against the lightning-stroke, why feareth he
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>To grant us power for to behold the shot?
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>And, contrariwise, if wills he to o'erwhelm us,
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>Quite off our guard, with fire, why thunders he
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>Off in yon quarter, so that we may shun?
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>Why rouseth he beforehand darkling air
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>And the far din and rumblings? And O how
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>Canst thou believe he shoots at one same time
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>Into diverse directions? Or darest thou
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>Contend that never hath it come to pass
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>That divers strokes have happened at one time?
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>But oft and often hath it come to pass,
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>And often still it must, that, even as showers
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>And rains o'er many regions fall, so too
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>Dart many thunderbolts at one same time.
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>Again, why never hurtles Jupiter
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>A bolt upon the lands nor pours abroad
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>Clap upon clap, when skies are cloudless all?
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>Or, say, doth he, so soon as ever the clouds
<A NAME="619"></A><BR>Have come thereunder, then into the same
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>Descend in person, and that from thence he may
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>Near-by decide upon the stroke of shaft?
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>And, lastly, why, with devastating bolt
<A NAME="623"></A><BR>Shakes he asunder holy shrines of gods
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>And his own thrones of splendour, and to-breaks
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>The well-wrought idols of divinities,
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>And robs of glory his own images
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>By wound of violence?
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>But to return apace,
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>Easy it is from these same facts to know
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>In just what wise those things (which from their 
<A NAME="631"></A>sort
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>The Greeks have named "bellows") do come down,
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>Discharged from on high, upon the seas.
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>For it haps that sometimes from the sky descends
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>Upon the seas a column, as if pushed,
<A NAME="636"></A><BR>Round which the surges seethe, tremendously
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>Aroused by puffing gusts; and whatso'er
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>Of ships are caught within that tumult then
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>Come into extreme peril, dashed along.
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>This haps when sometimes wind's aroused force
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>Can't burst the cloud it tries to, but down-weighs
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>That cloud, until 'tis like a column from sky
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>Upon the seas pushed downward- gradually,
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>As if a Somewhat from on high were shoved
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>By fist and nether thrust of arm, and lengthened
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>Far to the waves. And when the force of wind
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>Hath rived this cloud, from out the cloud it rushes
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>Down on the seas, and starts among the waves
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>A wondrous seething, for the eddying whirl
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>Descends and downward draws along with it
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>That cloud of ductile body. And soon as ever
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>'Thas shoved unto the levels of the main
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>That laden cloud, the whirl suddenly then
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>Plunges its whole self into the waters there
<A NAME="655"></A><BR>And rouses all the sea with monstrous roar,
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>Constraining it to seethe. It happens too
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>That very vortex of the wind involves
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>Itself in clouds, scraping from out the air
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>The seeds of cloud, and counterfeits, as 'twere,
<A NAME="660"></A><BR>The "bellows" pushed from heaven. And when this 
<A NAME="661"></A>shape
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>Hath dropped upon the lands and burst apart,
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>It belches forth immeasurable might
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>Of whirlwind and of blast. Yet since 'tis formed
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>At most but rarely, and on land the hills
<A NAME="666"></A><BR>Must block its way, 'tis seen more oft out there
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>On the broad prospect of the level main
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>Along the free horizons.
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>Into being
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>The clouds condense, when in this upper space
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>Of the high heaven have gathered suddenly,
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>As round they flew, unnumbered particles-
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>World's rougher ones, which can, though interlinked
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>With scanty couplings, yet be fastened firm,
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>The one on other caught. These particles
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>First cause small clouds to form; and, thereupon,
<A NAME="677"></A><BR>These catch the one on other and swarm in a flock
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>And grow by their conjoining, and by winds
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>Are borne along, along, until collects
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>The tempest fury. Happens, too, the nearer
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>The mountain summits neighbour to the sky,
<A NAME="682"></A><BR>The more unceasingly their far crags smoke
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>With the thick darkness of swart cloud, because
<A NAME="684"></A><BR>When first the mists do form, ere ever the eyes
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>Can there behold them (tenuous as they be),
<A NAME="686"></A><BR>The carrier-winds will drive them up and on
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>Unto the topmost summits of the mountain;
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>And then at last it happens, when they be
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>In vaster throng upgathered, that they can
<A NAME="690"></A><BR>By this very condensation lie revealed,
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>And that at same time they are seen to surge
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>From very vertex of the mountain up
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>Into far ether. For very fact and feeling,
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>As we up-climb high mountains, proveth clear
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>That windy are those upward regions free.
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>Besides, the clothes hung-out along the shore,
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>When in they take the clinging moisture, prove
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>That Nature lifts from over all the sea
<A NAME="699"></A><BR>Unnumbered particles. Whereby the more
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>'Tis manifest that many particles
<A NAME="701"></A><BR>Even from the salt upheavings of the main
<A NAME="702"></A><BR>Can rise together to augment the bulk
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>Of massed clouds. For moistures in these twain
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>Are near akin. Besides, from out all rivers,
<A NAME="705"></A><BR>As well as from the land itself, we see
<A NAME="706"></A><BR>Up-rising mists and steam, which like a breath
<A NAME="707"></A><BR>Are forced out from them and borne aloft,
<A NAME="708"></A><BR>To curtain heaven with their murk, and make,
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>By slow foregathering, the skiey clouds.
<A NAME="710"></A><BR>For, in addition, lo, the heat on high
<A NAME="711"></A><BR>Of constellated ether burdens down
<A NAME="712"></A><BR>Upon them, and by sort of condensation
<A NAME="713"></A><BR>Weaveth beneath the azure firmament
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>The reek of darkling cloud. It happens, too,
<A NAME="715"></A><BR>That hither to the skies from the Beyond
<A NAME="716"></A><BR>Do come those particles which make the clouds
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>And flying thunderheads. For I have taught
<A NAME="718"></A><BR>That this their number is innumerable
<A NAME="719"></A><BR>And infinite the sum of the Abyss,
<A NAME="720"></A><BR>And I have shown with what stupendous speed
<A NAME="721"></A><BR>Those bodies fly and how they're wont to pass
<A NAME="722"></A><BR>Amain through incommunicable space.
<A NAME="723"></A><BR>Therefore, 'tis not exceeding strange, if oft
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>In little time tempest and darkness cover
<A NAME="725"></A><BR>With bulking thunderheads hanging on high
<A NAME="726"></A><BR>The oceans and the lands, since everywhere
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>Through all the narrow tubes of yonder ether,
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>Yea, so to speak, through all the breathing-holes
<A NAME="729"></A><BR>Of the great upper-world encompassing,
<A NAME="730"></A><BR>There be for the primordial elements
<A NAME="731"></A><BR>Exits and entrances.
<A NAME="732"></A><BR>Now come, and how
<A NAME="733"></A><BR>The rainy moisture thickens into being
<A NAME="734"></A><BR>In the lofty clouds, and how upon the lands
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>'Tis then discharged in down-pour of large showers,
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>I will unfold. And first triumphantly
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>Will I persuade thee that up-rise together,
<A NAME="738"></A><BR>With clouds themselves, full many seeds of water
<A NAME="739"></A><BR>From out all things, and that they both increase-
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>Both clouds and water which is in the clouds-
<A NAME="741"></A><BR>In like proportion, as our frames increase
<A NAME="742"></A><BR>In like proportion with our blood, as well
<A NAME="743"></A><BR>As sweat or any moisture in our members.
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>Besides, the clouds take in from time to time
<A NAME="745"></A><BR>Much moisture risen from the broad marine,-
<A NAME="746"></A><BR>Whilst the winds bear them o'er the mighty sea,
<A NAME="747"></A><BR>Like hanging fleeces of white wool. Thuswise,
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>Even from all rivers is there lifted up
<A NAME="749"></A><BR>Moisture into the clouds. And when therein
<A NAME="750"></A><BR>The seeds of water so many in many ways
<A NAME="751"></A><BR>Have come together, augmented from all sides,
<A NAME="752"></A><BR>The close-jammed clouds then struggle to discharge
<A NAME="753"></A><BR>Their rain-storms for a two-fold reason: lo,
<A NAME="754"></A><BR>The wind's force crowds them, and the very excess
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>Of storm-clouds (massed in a vaster throng)
<A NAME="756"></A><BR>Giveth an urge and pressure from above
<A NAME="757"></A><BR>And makes the rains out-pour. Besides when, too,
<A NAME="758"></A><BR>The clouds are winnowed by the winds, or scattered
<A NAME="759"></A><BR>Smitten on top by heat of sun, they send
<A NAME="760"></A><BR>Their rainy moisture, and distil their drops,
<A NAME="761"></A><BR>Even as the wax, by fiery warmth on top,
<A NAME="762"></A><BR>Wasteth and liquefies abundantly.
<A NAME="763"></A><BR>But comes the violence of the bigger rains
<A NAME="764"></A><BR>When violently the clouds are weighted down
<A NAME="765"></A><BR>Both by their cumulated mass and by
<A NAME="766"></A><BR>The onset of the wind. And rains are wont
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>To endure awhile and to abide for long,
<A NAME="768"></A><BR>When many seeds of waters are aroused,
<A NAME="769"></A><BR>And clouds on clouds and racks on racks outstream
<A NAME="770"></A><BR>In piled layers and are borne along
<A NAME="771"></A><BR>From every quarter, and when all the earth
<A NAME="772"></A><BR>Smoking exhales her moisture. At such a time
<A NAME="773"></A><BR>When sun with beams amid the tempest-murk
<A NAME="774"></A><BR>Hath shone against the showers of black rains,
<A NAME="775"></A><BR>Then in the swart clouds there emerges bright
<A NAME="776"></A><BR>The radiance of the bow.
<A NAME="777"></A><BR>And as to things
<A NAME="778"></A><BR>Not mentioned here which of themselves do grow
<A NAME="779"></A><BR>Or of themselves are gendered, and all things
<A NAME="780"></A><BR>Which in the clouds condense to being- all,
<A NAME="781"></A><BR>Snow and the winds, hail and the hoar-frosts chill,
<A NAME="782"></A><BR>And freezing, mighty force- of lakes and pools
<A NAME="783"></A><BR>The mighty hardener, and mighty check
<A NAME="784"></A><BR>Which in the winter curbeth everywhere
<A NAME="785"></A><BR>The rivers as they go- 'tis easy still,
<A NAME="786"></A><BR>Soon to discover and with mind to see
<A NAME="787"></A><BR>How they all happen, whereby gendered,
<A NAME="788"></A><BR>When once thou well hast understood just what
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>Functions have been vouchsafed from of old
<A NAME="790"></A><BR>Unto the procreant atoms of the world.
<A NAME="791"></A><BR>Now come, and what the law of earthquakes is
<A NAME="792"></A><BR>Hearken, and first of all take care to know
<A NAME="793"></A><BR>That the under-earth, like to the earth around us,
<A NAME="794"></A><BR>Is full of windy caverns all about;
<A NAME="795"></A><BR>And many a pool and many a grim abyss
<A NAME="796"></A><BR>She bears within her bosom, ay, and cliffs
<A NAME="797"></A><BR>And jagged scarps; and many a river, hid
<A NAME="798"></A><BR>Beneath her chine, rolls rapidly along
<A NAME="799"></A><BR>Its billows and plunging boulders. For clear fact
<A NAME="800"></A><BR>Requires that earth must be in every part
<A NAME="801"></A><BR>Alike in constitution. Therefore, earth,
<A NAME="802"></A><BR>With these things underneath affixed and set,
<A NAME="803"></A><BR>Trembleth above, jarred by big down-tumblings,
<A NAME="804"></A><BR>When time hath undermined the huge caves,
<A NAME="805"></A><BR>The subterranean. Yea, whole mountains fall,
<A NAME="806"></A><BR>And instantly from spot of that big jar
<A NAME="807"></A><BR>There quiver the tremors far and wide abroad.
<A NAME="808"></A><BR>And with good reason: since houses on the street
<A NAME="809"></A><BR>Begin to quake throughout, when jarred by a cart
<A NAME="810"></A><BR>Of no large weight; and, too, the furniture
<A NAME="811"></A><BR>Within the house up-bounds, when a paving-block
<A NAME="812"></A><BR>Gives either iron rim of the wheels a jolt.
<A NAME="813"></A><BR>It happens, too, when some prodigious bulk
<A NAME="814"></A><BR>Of age-worn soil is rolled from mountain slopes
<A NAME="815"></A><BR>Into tremendous pools of water dark,
<A NAME="816"></A><BR>That the reeling land itself is rocked about
<A NAME="817"></A><BR>By the water's undulations; as a basin
<A NAME="818"></A><BR>Sometimes won't come to rest until the fluid
<A NAME="819"></A><BR>Within it ceases to be rocked about
<A NAME="820"></A><BR>In random undulations.
<A NAME="821"></A><BR>And besides,
<A NAME="822"></A><BR>When subterranean winds, up-gathered there
<A NAME="823"></A><BR>In the hollow deeps, bulk forward from one spot,
<A NAME="824"></A><BR>And press with the big urge of mighty powers
<A NAME="825"></A><BR>Against the lofty grottos, then the earth
<A NAME="826"></A><BR>Bulks to that quarter whither push amain
<A NAME="827"></A><BR>The headlong winds. Then all the builded houses
<A NAME="828"></A><BR>Above ground- and the more, the higher up-reared
<A NAME="829"></A><BR>Unto the sky- lean ominously, careening
<A NAME="830"></A><BR>Into the same direction; and the beams,
<A NAME="831"></A><BR>Wrenched forward, over-hang, ready to go.
<A NAME="832"></A><BR>Yet dread men to believe that there awaits
<A NAME="833"></A><BR>The nature of the mighty world a time
<A NAME="834"></A><BR>Of doom and cataclysm, albeit they see
<A NAME="835"></A><BR>So great a bulk of lands to bulge and break!
<A NAME="836"></A><BR>And lest the winds blew back again, no force
<A NAME="837"></A><BR>Could rein things in nor hold from sure career
<A NAME="838"></A><BR>On to disaster. But now because those winds
<A NAME="839"></A><BR>Blow back and forth in alternation strong,
<A NAME="840"></A><BR>And, so to say, rallying charge again,
<A NAME="841"></A><BR>And then repulsed retreat, on this account
<A NAME="842"></A><BR>Earth oftener threatens than she brings to pass
<A NAME="843"></A><BR>Collapses dire. For to one side she leans,
<A NAME="844"></A><BR>Then back she sways; and after tottering
<A NAME="845"></A><BR>Forward, recovers then her seats of poise.
<A NAME="846"></A><BR>Thus, this is why whole houses rock, the roofs
<A NAME="847"></A><BR>More than the middle stories, middle more
<A NAME="848"></A><BR>Than lowest, and the lowest least of all.
<A NAME="849"></A><BR><BR>Arises, too, this same great earth-quaking,
<A NAME="850"></A><BR>When wind and some prodigious force of air,
<A NAME="851"></A><BR>Collected from without or down within
<A NAME="852"></A><BR>The old telluric deeps, have hurled themselves
<A NAME="853"></A><BR>Amain into those caverns sub-terrene,
<A NAME="854"></A><BR>And there at first tumultuously chafe
<A NAME="855"></A><BR>Among the vasty grottos, borne about
<A NAME="856"></A><BR>In mad rotations, till their lashed force
<A NAME="857"></A><BR>Aroused out-bursts abroad, and then and there,
<A NAME="858"></A><BR>Riving the deep earth, makes a mighty chasm-
<A NAME="859"></A><BR>What once in Syrian Sidon did befall,
<A NAME="860"></A><BR>And once in Peloponnesian Aegium,
<A NAME="861"></A><BR>Twain cities which such out-break of wild air
<A NAME="862"></A><BR>And earth's convulsion, following hard upon,
<A NAME="863"></A><BR>O'erthrew of old. And many a walled town,
<A NAME="864"></A><BR>Besides, hath fall'n by such omnipotent
<A NAME="865"></A><BR>Convulsions on the land, and in the sea
<A NAME="866"></A><BR>Engulfed hath sunken many a city down
<A NAME="867"></A><BR>With all its populace. But if, indeed,
<A NAME="868"></A><BR>They burst not forth, yet is the very rush
<A NAME="869"></A><BR>Of the wild air and fury-force of wind
<A NAME="870"></A><BR>Then dissipated, like an ague-fit,
<A NAME="871"></A><BR>Through the innumerable pores of earth,
<A NAME="872"></A><BR>To set her all a-shake- even as a chill,
<A NAME="873"></A><BR>When it hath gone into our marrow-bones,
<A NAME="874"></A><BR>Sets us convulsively, despite ourselves,
<A NAME="875"></A><BR>A-shivering and a-shaking. Therefore, men
<A NAME="876"></A><BR>With two-fold terror bustle in alarm
<A NAME="877"></A><BR>Through cities to and fro: they fear the roofs
<A NAME="878"></A><BR>Above the head; and underfoot they dread
<A NAME="879"></A><BR>The caverns, lest the nature of the earth
<A NAME="880"></A><BR>Suddenly rend them open, and she gape,
<A NAME="881"></A><BR>Herself asunder, with tremendous maw,
<A NAME="882"></A><BR>And, all confounded, seek to chock it full
<A NAME="883"></A><BR>With her own ruins. Let men, then, go on
<A NAME="884"></A><BR>Feigning at will that heaven and earth shall be
<A NAME="885"></A><BR>Inviolable, entrusted evermore
<A NAME="886"></A><BR>To an eternal weal: and yet at times
<A NAME="887"></A><BR>The very force of danger here at hand
<A NAME="888"></A><BR>Prods them on some side with this goad of fear-
<A NAME="889"></A><BR>This among others- that the earth, withdrawn
<A NAME="890"></A><BR>Abruptly from under their feet, be hurried down,
<A NAME="891"></A><BR>Down into the abyss, and the Sum-of-Things
<A NAME="892"></A><BR>Be following after, utterly fordone,
<A NAME="893"></A><BR>Till be but wrack and wreckage of a world.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="894"></A><B>Extraordinary and Paradoxical Telluric Phenomena</B>

<A NAME="895"></A><BR><BR>In chief, men marvel Nature renders not
<A NAME="896"></A><BR>Bigger and bigger the bulk of ocean, since
<A NAME="897"></A><BR>So vast the down-rush of the waters be,
<A NAME="898"></A><BR>And every river out of every realm
<A NAME="899"></A><BR>Cometh thereto; and add the random rains
<A NAME="900"></A><BR>And flying tempests, which spatter every sea
<A NAME="901"></A><BR>And every land bedew; add their own springs:
<A NAME="902"></A><BR>Yet all of these unto the ocean's sum
<A NAME="903"></A><BR>Shall be but as the increase of a drop.
<A NAME="904"></A><BR>Wherefore 'tis less a marvel that the sea,
<A NAME="905"></A><BR>The mighty ocean, increaseth not. Besides,
<A NAME="906"></A><BR>Sun with his heat draws off a mighty part:
<A NAME="907"></A><BR>Yea, we behold that sun with burning beams
<A NAME="908"></A><BR>To dry our garments dripping all with wet;
<A NAME="909"></A><BR>And many a sea, and far out-spread beneath,
<A NAME="910"></A><BR>Do we behold. Therefore, however slight
<A NAME="911"></A><BR>The portion of wet that sun on any spot
<A NAME="912"></A><BR>Culls from the level main, he still will take
<A NAME="913"></A><BR>From off the waves in such a wide expanse
<A NAME="914"></A><BR><B>Abundantly.</B> Then, further, also winds,
<A NAME="915"></A><BR>Sweeping the level waters, can bear off
<A NAME="916"></A><BR>A mighty part of wet, since we behold
<A NAME="917"></A><BR>Oft in a single night the highways dried
<A NAME="918"></A><BR>By winds, and soft mud crusted o'er at dawn.
<A NAME="919"></A><BR><BR>Again, I've taught thee that the clouds bear 
<A NAME="920"></A>off
<A NAME="921"></A><BR>Much moisture too, up-taken from the reaches
<A NAME="922"></A><BR>Of the mighty main, and sprinkle it about
<A NAME="923"></A><BR>O'er all the zones, when rain is on the lands
<A NAME="924"></A><BR>And winds convey the aery racks of vapour.
<A NAME="925"></A><BR>Lastly, since earth is porous through her frame,
<A NAME="926"></A><BR>And neighbours on the seas, girdling their shores,
<A NAME="927"></A><BR>The water's wet must seep into the lands
<A NAME="928"></A><BR>From briny ocean, as from lands it comes
<A NAME="929"></A><BR>Into the seas. For brine is filtered off,
<A NAME="930"></A><BR>And then the liquid stuff seeps back again
<A NAME="931"></A><BR>And all re-poureth at the river-heads,
<A NAME="932"></A><BR>Whence in fresh-water currents it returns
<A NAME="933"></A><BR>Over the lands, adown the channels which
<A NAME="934"></A><BR>Were cleft erstwhile and erstwhile bore along
<A NAME="935"></A><BR>The liquid-footed floods.
<A NAME="936"></A><BR>And now the cause
<A NAME="937"></A><BR>Whereby athrough the throat of Aetna's Mount
<A NAME="938"></A><BR>Such vast tornado-fires out-breathe at times,
<A NAME="939"></A><BR>I will unfold: for with no middling might
<A NAME="940"></A><BR>Of devastation the flamy tempest rose
<A NAME="941"></A><BR>And held dominion in Sicilian fields:
<A NAME="942"></A><BR>Drawing upon itself the upturned faces
<A NAME="943"></A><BR>Of neighbouring clans, what time they saw afar
<A NAME="944"></A><BR>The skiey vaults a-fume and sparkling all,
<A NAME="945"></A><BR>And filled their bosoms with dread anxiety
<A NAME="946"></A><BR>Of what new thing Nature were travailing at.
<A NAME="947"></A><BR><BR>In these affairs it much behooveth thee
<A NAME="948"></A><BR>To look both wide and deep, and far abroad
<A NAME="949"></A><BR>To peer to every quarter, that thou mayst
<A NAME="950"></A><BR>Remember how boundless is the Sum-of-Things,
<A NAME="951"></A><BR>And mark how infinitely small a part
<A NAME="952"></A><BR>Of the whole Sum is this one sky of ours-
<A NAME="953"></A><BR>O not so large a part as is one man
<A NAME="954"></A><BR>Of the whole earth. And plainly if thou viewest
<A NAME="955"></A><BR>This cosmic fact, placing it square in front,
<A NAME="956"></A><BR>And plainly understandest, thou wilt leave
<A NAME="957"></A><BR>Wondering at many things. For who of us
<A NAME="958"></A><BR>Wondereth if some one gets into his joints
<A NAME="959"></A><BR>A fever, gathering head with fiery heat,
<A NAME="960"></A><BR>Or any other dolorous disease
<A NAME="961"></A><BR>Along his members? For anon the foot
<A NAME="962"></A><BR>Grows blue and bulbous; often the sharp twinge
<A NAME="963"></A><BR>Seizes the teeth, attacks the very eyes;
<A NAME="964"></A><BR>Out-breaks the sacred fire, and, crawling on
<A NAME="965"></A><BR>Over the body, burneth every part
<A NAME="966"></A><BR>It seizeth on, and works its hideous way
<A NAME="967"></A><BR>Along the frame. No marvel this, since, lo,
<A NAME="968"></A><BR>Of things innumerable be seeds enough,
<A NAME="969"></A><BR>And this our earth and sky do bring to us
<A NAME="970"></A><BR>Enough of bane from whence can grow the strength
<A NAME="971"></A><BR>Of maladies uncounted. Thuswise, then,
<A NAME="972"></A><BR>We must suppose to all the sky and earth
<A NAME="973"></A><BR>Are ever supplied from out the infinite
<A NAME="974"></A><BR>All things, O all in stores enough whereby
<A NAME="975"></A><BR>The shaken earth can of a sudden move,
<A NAME="976"></A><BR>And fierce typhoons can over sea and lands
<A NAME="977"></A><BR>Go tearing on, and Aetna's fires o'erflow,
<A NAME="978"></A><BR>And heaven become a flame-burst. For that, too,
<A NAME="979"></A><BR>Happens at times, and the celestial vaults
<A NAME="980"></A><BR>Glow into fire, and rainy tempests rise
<A NAME="981"></A><BR>In heavier congregation, when, percase,
<A NAME="982"></A><BR>The seeds of water have foregathered thus
<A NAME="983"></A><BR>From out the infinite. "Aye, but passing huge
<A NAME="984"></A><BR>The fiery turmoil of that conflagration!"
<A NAME="985"></A><BR>So sayst thou; well, huge many a river seems
<A NAME="986"></A><BR>To him that erstwhile ne'er a larger saw;
<A NAME="987"></A><BR>Thus, huge seems tree or man; and everything
<A NAME="988"></A><BR>Which mortal sees the biggest of each class,
<A NAME="989"></A><BR>That he imagines to be "huge"; though yet
<A NAME="990"></A><BR>All these, with sky and land and sea to boot,
<A NAME="991"></A><BR>Are all as nothing to the sum entire
<A NAME="992"></A><BR>Of the all-Sum.
<A NAME="993"></A><BR>But now I will unfold
<A NAME="994"></A><BR>At last how yonder suddenly angered flame
<A NAME="995"></A><BR>Out-blows abroad from vasty furnaces
<A NAME="996"></A><BR><B>Aetnaean.</B> First, the mountain's nature is
<A NAME="997"></A><BR>All under-hollow, propped about, about
<A NAME="998"></A><BR>With caverns of basaltic piers. And, lo,
<A NAME="999"></A><BR>In all its grottos be there wind and air-
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR>For wind is made when air hath been uproused
<A NAME="1001"></A><BR>By violent agitation. When this air
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR>Is heated through and through, and, raging round,
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR>Hath made the earth and all the rocks it touches
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR>Horribly hot, and hath struck off from them
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR>Fierce fire of swiftest flame, it lifts itself
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR>And hurtles thus straight upwards through its throat
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR>Into high heav'n, and thus bears on afar
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR>Its burning blasts and scattereth afar
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR>Its ashes, and rolls a smoke of pitchy murk
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR>And heaveth the while boulders of wondrous weight
<A NAME="1011"></A><BR>Leaving no doubt in thee that 'tis the air's
<A NAME="1012"></A><BR>Tumultuous power. Besides, in mighty part,
<A NAME="1013"></A><BR>The sea there at the roots of that same mount
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR>Breaks its old billows and sucks back its surf.
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR>And grottos from the sea pass in below
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR>Even to the bottom of the mountain's throat.
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR>Herethrough thou must admit there go...
<A NAME="1018"></A><BR><BR>And the conditions force the water and air
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR>Deeply to penetrate from the open sea,
<A NAME="1020"></A><BR>And to out-blow abroad, and to up-bear
<A NAME="1021"></A><BR>Thereby the flame, and to up-cast from deeps
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR>The boulders, and to rear the clouds of sand.
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR>For at the top be "bowls," as people there
<A NAME="1024"></A><BR>Are wont to name what we at Rome do call
<A NAME="1025"></A><BR>The throats and mouths.
<A NAME="1026"></A><BR>There be, besides, some thing
<A NAME="1027"></A><BR>Of which 'tis not enough one only cause
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR>To state- but rather several, whereof one
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR>Will be the true: lo, if thou shouldst espy
<A NAME="1030"></A><BR>Lying afar some fellow's lifeless corse,
<A NAME="1031"></A><BR>'Twere meet to name all causes of a death,
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR>That cause of his death might thereby be named:
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR>For prove thou mayst he perished not by steel,
<A NAME="1034"></A><BR>By cold, nor even by poison nor disease,
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR>Yet somewhat of this sort hath come to him
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR>We know- And thus we have to say the same
<A NAME="1037"></A><BR>In divers cases.
<A NAME="1038"></A><BR>Toward the summer, Nile
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR>Waxeth and overfloweth the champaign,
<A NAME="1040"></A><BR>Unique in all the landscape, river sole
<A NAME="1041"></A><BR>Of the Aegyptians. In mid-season heats
<A NAME="1042"></A><BR>Often and oft he waters Aegypt o'er,
<A NAME="1043"></A><BR>Either because in summer against his mouths
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR>Come those north winds which at that time of year
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR>Men name the Etesian blasts, and, blowing thus
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR>Upstream, retard, and, forcing back his waves,
<A NAME="1047"></A><BR>Fill him o'erfull and force his flow to stop.
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR>For out of doubt these blasts which driven be
<A NAME="1049"></A><BR>From icy constellations of the pole
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR>Are borne straight up the river. Comes that river
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR>From forth the sultry places down the south,
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR>Rising far up in midmost realm of day,
<A NAME="1053"></A><BR>Among black generations of strong men
<A NAME="1054"></A><BR>With sun-baked skins. 'Tis possible, besides,
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR>That a big bulk of piled sand may bar
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR>His mouths against his onward waves, when sea,
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR>Wild in the winds, tumbles the sand to inland;
<A NAME="1058"></A><BR>Whereby the river's outlet were less free,
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR>Likewise less headlong his descending floods.
<A NAME="1060"></A><BR>It may be, too, that in this season rains
<A NAME="1061"></A><BR>Are more abundant at its fountain head,
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR>Because the Etesian blasts of those north winds
<A NAME="1063"></A><BR>Then urge all clouds into those inland parts.
<A NAME="1064"></A><BR>And, soothly, when they're thus foregathered there.
<A NAME="1065"></A><BR>Urged yonder into midmost realm of day,
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR>Then, crowded against the lofty mountain sides,
<A NAME="1067"></A><BR>They're massed and powerfully pressed. Again,
<A NAME="1068"></A><BR>Perchance, his waters wax, O far away,
<A NAME="1069"></A><BR>Among the Aethiopians' lofty mountains,
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR>When the all-beholding sun with thawing beams
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR>Drives the white snows to flow into the vales.
<A NAME="1072"></A><BR><BR>Now come; and unto thee I will unfold,
<A NAME="1073"></A><BR>As to the Birdless spots and Birdless tarns,
<A NAME="1074"></A><BR>What sort of nature they are furnished with.
<A NAME="1075"></A><BR>First, as to name of "birdless,"- that derives
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR>From very fact, because they noxious be
<A NAME="1077"></A><BR>Unto all birds. For when above those spots
<A NAME="1078"></A><BR>In horizontal flight the birds have come,
<A NAME="1079"></A><BR>Forgetting to oar with wings, they furl their sails,
<A NAME="1080"></A><BR>And, with down-drooping of their delicate necks,
<A NAME="1081"></A><BR>Fall headlong into earth, if haply such
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR>The nature of the spots, or into water,
<A NAME="1083"></A><BR>If haply spreads there under Birdless tarn.
<A NAME="1084"></A><BR>Such spot's at Cumae, where the mountains smoke,
<A NAME="1085"></A><BR>Charged with the pungent sulphur, and increased
<A NAME="1086"></A><BR>With steaming springs. And such a spot there is
<A NAME="1087"></A><BR>Within the walls of Athens, even there
<A NAME="1088"></A><BR>On summit of Acropolis, beside
<A NAME="1089"></A><BR>Fane of Tritonian Pallas bountiful,
<A NAME="1090"></A><BR>Where never cawing crows can wing their course,
<A NAME="1091"></A><BR>Not even when smoke the altars with good gifts-
<A NAME="1092"></A><BR>But evermore they flee- yet not from wrath
<A NAME="1093"></A><BR>Of Pallas, grieved at that espial old,
<A NAME="1094"></A><BR>As poets of the Greeks have sung the tale;
<A NAME="1095"></A><BR>But very nature of the place compels.
<A NAME="1096"></A><BR>In Syria also- as men say- a spot
<A NAME="1097"></A><BR>Is to be seen, where also four-foot kinds,
<A NAME="1098"></A><BR>As soon as ever they've set their steps within,
<A NAME="1099"></A><BR>Collapse, o'ercome by its essential power,
<A NAME="1100"></A><BR>As if there slaughtered to the under-gods.
<A NAME="1101"></A><BR>Lo, all these wonders work by natural law,
<A NAME="1102"></A><BR>And from what causes they are brought to pass
<A NAME="1103"></A><BR>The origin is manifest; so, haply,
<A NAME="1104"></A><BR>Let none believe that in these regions stands
<A NAME="1105"></A><BR>The gate of Orcus, nor us then suppose,
<A NAME="1106"></A><BR>Haply, that thence the under-gods draw down
<A NAME="1107"></A><BR>Souls to dark shores of Acheron- as stags,
<A NAME="1108"></A><BR>The wing-footed, are thought to draw to light,
<A NAME="1109"></A><BR>By sniffing nostrils, from their dusky lairs
<A NAME="1110"></A><BR>The wriggling generations of wild snakes.
<A NAME="1111"></A><BR>How far removed from true reason is this,
<A NAME="1112"></A><BR>Perceive thou straight; for now I'll try to say
<A NAME="1113"></A><BR>Somewhat about the very fact.
<A NAME="1114"></A><BR>And, first,
<A NAME="1115"></A><BR>This do I say, as oft I've said before:
<A NAME="1116"></A><BR>In earth are atoms of things of every sort;
<A NAME="1117"></A><BR>And know, these all thus rise from out the earth-
<A NAME="1118"></A><BR>Many life-giving which be good for food,
<A NAME="1119"></A><BR>And many which can generate disease
<A NAME="1120"></A><BR>And hasten death, O many primal seeds
<A NAME="1121"></A><BR>Of many things in many modes- since earth
<A NAME="1122"></A><BR>Contains them mingled and gives forth discrete.
<A NAME="1123"></A><BR>And we have shown before that certain things
<A NAME="1124"></A><BR>Be unto certain creatures suited more
<A NAME="1125"></A><BR>For ends of life, by virtue of a nature,
<A NAME="1126"></A><BR>A texture, and primordial shapes, unlike
<A NAME="1127"></A><BR>For kinds alike. Then too 'tis thine to see
<A NAME="1128"></A><BR>How many things oppressive be and foul
<A NAME="1129"></A><BR>To man, and to sensation most malign:
<A NAME="1130"></A><BR>Many meander miserably through ears;
<A NAME="1131"></A><BR>Many in-wind athrough the nostrils too,
<A NAME="1132"></A><BR>Malign and harsh when mortal draws a breath;
<A NAME="1133"></A><BR>Of not a few must one avoid the touch;
<A NAME="1134"></A><BR>Of not a few must one escape the sight;
<A NAME="1135"></A><BR>And some there be all loathsome to the taste;
<A NAME="1136"></A><BR>And many, besides, relax the languid limbs
<A NAME="1137"></A><BR>Along the frame, and undermine the soul
<A NAME="1138"></A><BR>In its abodes within. To certain trees
<A NAME="1139"></A><BR>There hath been given so dolorous a shade
<A NAME="1140"></A><BR>That often they gender achings of the head,
<A NAME="1141"></A><BR>If one but be beneath, outstretched on the sward.
<A NAME="1142"></A><BR>There is, again, on Helicon's high hills
<A NAME="1143"></A><BR>A tree that's wont to kill a man outright
<A NAME="1144"></A><BR>By fetid odour of its very flower.
<A NAME="1145"></A><BR>And when the pungent stench of the night-lamp,
<A NAME="1146"></A><BR>Extinguished but a moment since, assails
<A NAME="1147"></A><BR>The nostrils, then and there it puts to sleep
<A NAME="1148"></A><BR>A man afflicted with the falling sickness
<A NAME="1149"></A><BR>And foamings at the mouth. A woman, too,
<A NAME="1150"></A><BR>At the heavy castor drowses back in chair,
<A NAME="1151"></A><BR>And from her delicate fingers slips away
<A NAME="1152"></A><BR>Her gaudy handiwork, if haply she
<A NAME="1153"></A><BR>Hath got the whiff at menstruation-time.
<A NAME="1154"></A><BR>Once more, if thou delayest in hot baths,
<A NAME="1155"></A><BR>When thou art over-full, how readily
<A NAME="1156"></A><BR>From stool in middle of the steaming water
<A NAME="1157"></A><BR>Thou tumblest in a fit! How readily
<A NAME="1158"></A><BR>The heavy fumes of charcoal wind their way
<A NAME="1159"></A><BR>Into the brain, unless beforehand we
<A NAME="1160"></A><BR>Of water 've drunk. But when a burning fever,
<A NAME="1161"></A><BR>O'ermastering man, hath seized upon his limbs,
<A NAME="1162"></A><BR>Then odour of wine is like a hammer-blow.
<A NAME="1163"></A><BR>And seest thou not how in the very earth
<A NAME="1164"></A><BR>Sulphur is gendered and bitumen thickens
<A NAME="1165"></A><BR>With noisome stench. What direful stenches, too,
<A NAME="1166"></A><BR>Scaptensula out-breathes from down below,
<A NAME="1167"></A><BR>When men pursue the veins of silver and gold,
<A NAME="1168"></A><BR>With pick-axe probing round the hidden realms
<A NAME="1169"></A><BR>Deep in the earth?- Or what of deadly bane
<A NAME="1170"></A><BR>The mines of gold exhale? O what a look,
<A NAME="1171"></A><BR>And what a ghastly hue they give to men!
<A NAME="1172"></A><BR>And seest thou not, or hearest, how they're wont
<A NAME="1173"></A><BR>In little time to perish, and how fail
<A NAME="1174"></A><BR>The life-stores in those folk whom mighty power
<A NAME="1175"></A><BR>Of grim necessity confineth there
<A NAME="1176"></A><BR>In such a task? Thus, this telluric earth
<A NAME="1177"></A><BR>Out-streams with all these dread effluvia
<A NAME="1178"></A><BR>And breathes them out into the open world
<A NAME="1179"></A><BR>And into the visible regions under heaven.
<A NAME="1180"></A><BR><BR>Thus, too, those Birdless places must up-send
<A NAME="1181"></A><BR>An essence bearing death to winged things,
<A NAME="1182"></A><BR>Which from the earth rises into the breezes
<A NAME="1183"></A><BR>To poison part of skiey space, and when
<A NAME="1184"></A><BR>Thither the winged is on pennons borne,
<A NAME="1185"></A><BR>There, seized by the unseen poison, 'tis ensnared,
<A NAME="1186"></A><BR>And from the horizontal of its flight
<A NAME="1187"></A><BR>Drops to the spot whence sprang the effluvium.
<A NAME="1188"></A><BR>And when 'thas there collapsed, then the same power
<A NAME="1189"></A><BR>Of that effluvium takes from all its limbs
<A NAME="1190"></A><BR>The relics of its life. That power first strikes
<A NAME="1191"></A><BR>The creatures with a wildering dizziness,
<A NAME="1192"></A><BR>And then thereafter, when they're once down-fallen
<A NAME="1193"></A><BR>Into the poison's very fountains, then
<A NAME="1194"></A><BR>Life, too, they vomit out perforce, because
<A NAME="1195"></A><BR>So thick the stores of bane around them fume.
<A NAME="1196"></A><BR>Again, at times it happens that this power,
<A NAME="1197"></A><BR>This exhalation of the Birdless places,
<A NAME="1198"></A><BR>Dispels the air betwixt the ground and birds,
<A NAME="1199"></A><BR>Leaving well-nigh a void. And thither when
<A NAME="1200"></A><BR>In horizontal flight the birds have come,
<A NAME="1201"></A><BR>Forthwith their buoyancy of pennons limps,
<A NAME="1202"></A><BR>All useless, and each effort of both wings
<A NAME="1203"></A><BR>Falls out in vain. Here, when without all power
<A NAME="1204"></A><BR>To buoy themselves and on their wings to lean,
<A NAME="1205"></A><BR>Lo, Nature constrains them by their weight to slip
<A NAME="1206"></A><BR>Down to the earth, and lying prostrate there
<A NAME="1207"></A><BR>Along the well-nigh empty void, they spend
<A NAME="1208"></A><BR>Their souls through all the openings of their frame.
<A NAME="1209"></A><BR><BR>Further, the water of wells is colder then
<A NAME="1210"></A><BR>At summer time, because the earth by heat
<A NAME="1211"></A><BR>Is rarefied, and sends abroad in air
<A NAME="1212"></A><BR>Whatever seeds it peradventure have
<A NAME="1213"></A><BR>Of its own fiery exhalations.
<A NAME="1214"></A><BR>The more, then, the telluric ground is drained
<A NAME="1215"></A><BR>Of heat, the colder grows the water hid
<A NAME="1216"></A><BR>Within the earth. Further, when all the earth
<A NAME="1217"></A><BR>Is by the cold compressed, and thus contracts
<A NAME="1218"></A><BR>And, so to say, concretes, it happens, lo,
<A NAME="1219"></A><BR>That by contracting it expresses then
<A NAME="1220"></A><BR>Into the wells what heat it bears itself.
<A NAME="1221"></A><BR><BR>'Tis said at Hammon's fane a fountain is,
<A NAME="1222"></A><BR>In daylight cold and hot in time of night.
<A NAME="1223"></A><BR>This fountain men be-wonder over-much,
<A NAME="1224"></A><BR>And think that suddenly it seethes in heat
<A NAME="1225"></A><BR>By intense sun, the subterranean, when
<A NAME="1226"></A><BR>Night with her terrible murk hath cloaked the lands-
<A NAME="1227"></A><BR>What's not true reasoning by a long remove:
<A NAME="1228"></A><BR>I' faith when sun o'erhead, touching with beams
<A NAME="1229"></A><BR>An open body of water, had no power
<A NAME="1230"></A><BR>To render it hot upon its upper side,
<A NAME="1231"></A><BR>Though his high light possess such burning glare,
<A NAME="1232"></A><BR>How, then, can he, when under the gross earth,
<A NAME="1233"></A><BR>Make water boil and glut with fiery heat?-
<A NAME="1234"></A><BR>And, specially, since scarcely potent he
<A NAME="1235"></A><BR>Through hedging walls of houses to inject
<A NAME="1236"></A><BR>His exhalations hot, with ardent rays.
<A NAME="1237"></A><BR>What, then, the principle? Why, this, indeed:
<A NAME="1238"></A><BR>The earth about that spring is porous more
<A NAME="1239"></A><BR>Than elsewhere the telluric ground, and be
<A NAME="1240"></A><BR>Many the seeds of fire hard by the water;
<A NAME="1241"></A><BR>On this account, when night with dew-fraught shades
<A NAME="1242"></A><BR>Hath whelmed the earth, anon the earth deep down
<A NAME="1243"></A><BR>Grows chill, contracts; and thuswise squeezes out
<A NAME="1244"></A><BR>Into the spring what seeds she holds of fire
<A NAME="1245"></A><BR>(As one might squeeze with fist), which render hot
<A NAME="1246"></A><BR>The touch and steam of the fluid. Next, when sun,
<A NAME="1247"></A><BR>Up-risen, with his rays has split the soil
<A NAME="1248"></A><BR>And rarefied the earth with waxing heat,
<A NAME="1249"></A><BR>Again into their ancient abodes return
<A NAME="1250"></A><BR>The seeds of fire, and all the Hot of water
<A NAME="1251"></A><BR>Into the earth retires; and this is why
<A NAME="1252"></A><BR>The fountain in the daylight gets so cold.
<A NAME="1253"></A><BR>Besides, the water's wet is beat upon
<A NAME="1254"></A><BR>By rays of sun, and, with the dawn, becomes
<A NAME="1255"></A><BR>Rarer in texture under his pulsing blaze;
<A NAME="1256"></A><BR>And, therefore, whatso seeds it holds of fire
<A NAME="1257"></A><BR>It renders up, even as it renders oft
<A NAME="1258"></A><BR>The frost that it contains within itself
<A NAME="1259"></A><BR>And thaws its ice and looseneth the knots.
<A NAME="1260"></A><BR>There is, moreover, a fountain cold in kind
<A NAME="1261"></A><BR>That makes a bit of tow (above it held)
<A NAME="1262"></A><BR>Take fire forthwith and shoot a flame; so, too,
<A NAME="1263"></A><BR>A pitch-pine torch will kindle and flare round
<A NAME="1264"></A><BR>Along its waves, wherever 'tis impelled
<A NAME="1265"></A><BR>Afloat before the breeze. No marvel, this:
<A NAME="1266"></A><BR>Because full many seeds of heat there be
<A NAME="1267"></A><BR>Within the water; and, from earth itself
<A NAME="1268"></A><BR>Out of the deeps must particles of fire
<A NAME="1269"></A><BR>Athrough the entire fountain surge aloft,
<A NAME="1270"></A><BR>And speed in exhalations into air
<A NAME="1271"></A><BR>Forth and abroad (yet not in numbers enow
<A NAME="1272"></A><BR>As to make hot the fountain). And, moreo'er,
<A NAME="1273"></A><BR>Some force constrains them, scattered through the 
<A NAME="1274"></A>water,
<A NAME="1275"></A><BR>Forthwith to burst abroad, and to combine
<A NAME="1276"></A><BR>In flame above. Even as a fountain far
<A NAME="1277"></A><BR>There is at Aradus amid the sea,
<A NAME="1278"></A><BR>Which bubbles out sweet water and disparts
<A NAME="1279"></A><BR>From round itself the salt waves; and, behold,
<A NAME="1280"></A><BR>In many another region the broad main
<A NAME="1281"></A><BR>Yields to the thirsty mariners timely help,
<A NAME="1282"></A><BR>Belching sweet waters forth amid salt waves.
<A NAME="1283"></A><BR>Just so, then, can those seeds of fire burst forth
<A NAME="1284"></A><BR>Athrough that other fount, and bubble out
<A NAME="1285"></A><BR>Abroad against the bit of tow; and when
<A NAME="1286"></A><BR>They there collect or cleave unto the torch,
<A NAME="1287"></A><BR>Forthwith they readily flash aflame, because
<A NAME="1288"></A><BR>The tow and torches, also, in themselves
<A NAME="1289"></A><BR>Have many seeds of latent fire. Indeed,
<A NAME="1290"></A><BR>And seest thou not, when near the nightly lamps
<A NAME="1291"></A><BR>Thou bringest a flaxen wick, extinguished
<A NAME="1292"></A><BR>A moment since, it catches fire before
<A NAME="1293"></A><BR>'Thas touched the flame, and in same wise a torch?
<A NAME="1294"></A><BR>And many another object flashes aflame
<A NAME="1295"></A><BR>When at a distance, touched by heat alone,
<A NAME="1296"></A><BR>Before 'tis steeped in veritable fire.
<A NAME="1297"></A><BR>This, then, we must suppose to come to pass
<A NAME="1298"></A><BR>In that spring also.
<A NAME="1299"></A><BR>Now to other things!
<A NAME="1300"></A><BR>And I'll begin to treat by what decree
<A NAME="1301"></A><BR>Of Nature it came to pass that iron can be
<A NAME="1302"></A><BR>By that stone drawn which Greeks the magnet call
<A NAME="1303"></A><BR>After the country's name (its origin
<A NAME="1304"></A><BR>Being in country of Magnesian folk).
<A NAME="1305"></A><BR>This stone men marvel at; and sure it oft
<A NAME="1306"></A><BR>Maketh a chain of rings, depending, lo,
<A NAME="1307"></A><BR>From off itself! Nay, thou mayest see at times
<A NAME="1308"></A><BR>Five or yet more in order dangling down
<A NAME="1309"></A><BR>And swaying in the delicate winds, whilst one
<A NAME="1310"></A><BR>Depends from other, cleaving to under-side,
<A NAME="1311"></A><BR>And ilk one feels the stone's own power and bonds-
<A NAME="1312"></A><BR>So over-masteringly its power flows down.
<A NAME="1313"></A><BR>In things of this sort, much must be made sure
<A NAME="1314"></A><BR>Ere thou account of the thing itself canst give,
<A NAME="1315"></A><BR>And the approaches roundabout must be;
<A NAME="1316"></A><BR>Wherefore the more do I exact of thee
<A NAME="1317"></A><BR>A mind and ears attent.
<A NAME="1318"></A><BR>First, from all things
<A NAME="1319"></A><BR>We see soever, evermore must flow,
<A NAME="1320"></A><BR>Must be discharged and strewn about, about,
<A NAME="1321"></A><BR>Bodies that strike the eyes, awaking sight.
<A NAME="1322"></A><BR>From certain things flow odours evermore,
<A NAME="1323"></A><BR>As cold from rivers, heat from sun, and spray
<A NAME="1324"></A><BR>From waves of ocean, eater-out of walls
<A NAME="1325"></A><BR>Along the coasts. Nor ever cease to seep
<A NAME="1326"></A><BR>The varied echoings athrough the air.
<A NAME="1327"></A><BR>Then, too, there comes into the mouth at times
<A NAME="1328"></A><BR>The wet of a salt taste, when by the sea
<A NAME="1329"></A><BR>We roam about; and so, whene'er we watch
<A NAME="1330"></A><BR>The wormwood being mixed, its bitter stings.
<A NAME="1331"></A><BR>To such degree from all things is each thing
<A NAME="1332"></A><BR>Borne streamingly along, and sent about
<A NAME="1333"></A><BR>To every region round; and Nature grants
<A NAME="1334"></A><BR>Nor rest nor respite of the onward flow,
<A NAME="1335"></A><BR>Since 'tis incessantly we feeling have,
<A NAME="1336"></A><BR>And all the time are suffered to descry
<A NAME="1337"></A><BR>And smell all things at hand and hear them sound.
<A NAME="1338"></A><BR>Now will I seek again to bring to mind
<A NAME="1339"></A><BR>How porous a body all things have- a fact
<A NAME="1340"></A><BR>Made manifest in my first canto, too.
<A NAME="1341"></A><BR>For truly, though to know this doth import
<A NAME="1342"></A><BR>For many things, yet for this very thing
<A NAME="1343"></A><BR>On which straightway I'm going to discourse,
<A NAME="1344"></A><BR>'Tis needful most of all to make it sure
<A NAME="1345"></A><BR>That naught's at hand but body mixed with void.
<A NAME="1346"></A><BR>A first ensample: in grottos, rocks o'erhead
<A NAME="1347"></A><BR>Sweat moisture and distil the oozy drops;
<A NAME="1348"></A><BR>Likewise, from all our body seeps the sweat;
<A NAME="1349"></A><BR>There grows the beard, and along our members all
<A NAME="1350"></A><BR>And along our frame the hairs. Through all our veins
<A NAME="1351"></A><BR>Disseminates the foods, and gives increase
<A NAME="1352"></A><BR>And aliment down to the extreme parts,
<A NAME="1353"></A><BR>Even to the tiniest finger-nails. Likewise,
<A NAME="1354"></A><BR>Through solid bronze the cold and fiery heat
<A NAME="1355"></A><BR>We feel to pass; likewise, we feel them pass
<A NAME="1356"></A><BR>Through gold, through silver, when we clasp in hand
<A NAME="1357"></A><BR>The brimming goblets. And, again, there flit
<A NAME="1358"></A><BR>Voices through houses' hedging walls of stone;
<A NAME="1359"></A><BR>Odour seeps through, and cold, and heat of fire
<A NAME="1360"></A><BR>That's wont to penetrate even strength of iron.
<A NAME="1361"></A><BR>Again, where corselet of the sky girds round
<A NAME="1362"></A><BR><BR>And at same time, some Influence of bane,
<A NAME="1363"></A><BR>When from Beyond 'thas stolen into our world.
<A NAME="1364"></A><BR>And tempests, gathering from the earth and sky,
<A NAME="1365"></A><BR>Back to the sky and earth absorbed retire-
<A NAME="1366"></A><BR>With reason, since there's naught that's fashioned 
<A NAME="1367"></A>not
<A NAME="1368"></A><BR>With body porous.
<A NAME="1369"></A><BR>Furthermore, not all
<A NAME="1370"></A><BR>The particles which be from things thrown off
<A NAME="1371"></A><BR>Are furnished with same qualities for sense,
<A NAME="1372"></A><BR>Nor be for all things equally adapt.
<A NAME="1373"></A><BR>A first ensample: the sun doth bake and parch
<A NAME="1374"></A><BR>The earth; but ice he thaws, and with his beams
<A NAME="1375"></A><BR>Compels the lofty snows, up-reared white
<A NAME="1376"></A><BR>Upon the lofty hills, to waste away;
<A NAME="1377"></A><BR>Then, wax, if set beneath the heat of him,
<A NAME="1378"></A><BR>Melts to a liquid. And the fire, likewise,
<A NAME="1379"></A><BR>Will melt the copper and will fuse the gold,
<A NAME="1380"></A><BR>But hides and flesh it shrivels up and shrinks.
<A NAME="1381"></A><BR>The water hardens the iron just off the fire,
<A NAME="1382"></A><BR>But hides and flesh (made hard by heat) it softens.
<A NAME="1383"></A><BR>The oleaster-tree as much delights
<A NAME="1384"></A><BR>The bearded she-goats, verily as though
<A NAME="1385"></A><BR>'Twere nectar-steeped and shed ambrosia;
<A NAME="1386"></A><BR>Than which is naught that burgeons into leaf
<A NAME="1387"></A><BR>More bitter food for man. A hog draws back
<A NAME="1388"></A><BR>For marjoram oil, and every unguent fears
<A NAME="1389"></A><BR>Fierce poison these unto the bristled hogs,
<A NAME="1390"></A><BR>Yet unto us from time to time they seem,
<A NAME="1391"></A><BR>As 'twere, to give new life. But, contrariwise,
<A NAME="1392"></A><BR>Though unto us the mire be filth most foul,
<A NAME="1393"></A><BR>To hogs that mire doth so delightsome seem
<A NAME="1394"></A><BR>That they with wallowing from belly to back
<A NAME="1395"></A><BR>Are never cloyed.
<A NAME="1396"></A><BR>A point remains, besides,
<A NAME="1397"></A><BR>Which best it seems to tell of, ere I go
<A NAME="1398"></A><BR>To telling of the fact at hand itself.
<A NAME="1399"></A><BR>Since to the varied things assigned be
<A NAME="1400"></A><BR>The many pores, those pores must be diverse
<A NAME="1401"></A><BR>In nature one from other, and each have
<A NAME="1402"></A><BR>Its very shape, its own direction fixed.
<A NAME="1403"></A><BR>And so, indeed, in breathing creatures be
<A NAME="1404"></A><BR>The several senses, of which each takes in
<A NAME="1405"></A><BR>Unto itself, in its own fashion ever,
<A NAME="1406"></A><BR>Its own peculiar object. For we mark
<A NAME="1407"></A><BR>How sounds do into one place penetrate,
<A NAME="1408"></A><BR>Into another flavours of all juice,
<A NAME="1409"></A><BR>And savour of smell into a third. Moreover,
<A NAME="1410"></A><BR>One sort through rocks we see to seep, and, lo,
<A NAME="1411"></A><BR>One sort to pass through wood, another still
<A NAME="1412"></A><BR>Through gold, and others to go out and off
<A NAME="1413"></A><BR>Through silver and through glass. For we do see
<A NAME="1414"></A><BR>Through some pores form-and-look of things to flow,
<A NAME="1415"></A><BR>Through others heat to go, and some things still
<A NAME="1416"></A><BR>To speedier pass than others through same pores.
<A NAME="1417"></A><BR>Of verity, the nature of these same paths,
<A NAME="1418"></A><BR>Varying in many modes (as aforesaid)
<A NAME="1419"></A><BR>Because of unlike nature and warp and woof
<A NAME="1420"></A><BR>Of cosmic things, constrains it so to be.
<A NAME="1421"></A><BR><BR>Wherefore, since all these matters now have 
<A NAME="1422"></A>been
<A NAME="1423"></A><BR>Established and settled well for us
<A NAME="1424"></A><BR>As premises prepared, for what remains
<A NAME="1425"></A><BR>'Twill not be hard to render clear account
<A NAME="1426"></A><BR>By means of these, and the whole cause reveal
<A NAME="1427"></A><BR>Whereby the magnet lures the strength of iron.
<A NAME="1428"></A><BR>First, stream there must from off the lode-stone 
<A NAME="1429"></A>seeds
<A NAME="1430"></A><BR>Innumerable, a very tide, which smites
<A NAME="1431"></A><BR>By blows that air asunder lying betwixt
<A NAME="1432"></A><BR>The stone and iron. And when is emptied out
<A NAME="1433"></A><BR>This space, and a large place between the two
<A NAME="1434"></A><BR>Is made a void, forthwith the primal germs
<A NAME="1435"></A><BR>Of iron, headlong slipping, fall conjoined
<A NAME="1436"></A><BR>Into the vacuum, and the ring itself
<A NAME="1437"></A><BR>By reason thereof doth follow after and go
<A NAME="1438"></A><BR>Thuswise with all its body. And naught there is
<A NAME="1439"></A><BR>That of its own primordial elements
<A NAME="1440"></A><BR>More thoroughly knit or tighter linked coheres
<A NAME="1441"></A><BR>Than nature and cold roughness of stout iron.
<A NAME="1442"></A><BR>Wherefore, 'tis less a marvel what I said,
<A NAME="1443"></A><BR>That from such elements no bodies can
<A NAME="1444"></A><BR>From out the iron collect in larger throng
<A NAME="1445"></A><BR>And be into the vacuum borne along,
<A NAME="1446"></A><BR>Without the ring itself do follow after.
<A NAME="1447"></A><BR>And this it does, and followeth on until
<A NAME="1448"></A><BR>'Thath reached the stone itself and cleaved to it
<A NAME="1449"></A><BR>By links invisible. Moreover, likewise,
<A NAME="1450"></A><BR>The motion's assisted by a thing of aid
<A NAME="1451"></A><BR>(Whereby the process easier becomes)-
<A NAME="1452"></A><BR>Namely, by this: as soon as rarer grows
<A NAME="1453"></A><BR>That air in front of the ring, and space between
<A NAME="1454"></A><BR>Is emptied more and made a void, forthwith
<A NAME="1455"></A><BR>It happens all the air that lies behind
<A NAME="1456"></A><BR>Conveys it onward, pushing from the rear.
<A NAME="1457"></A><BR>For ever doth the circumambient air
<A NAME="1458"></A><BR>Drub things unmoved, but here it pushes forth
<A NAME="1459"></A><BR>The iron, because upon one side the space
<A NAME="1460"></A><BR>Lies void and thus receives the iron in.
<A NAME="1461"></A><BR>This air, whereof I am reminding thee,
<A NAME="1462"></A><BR>Winding athrough the iron's abundant pores
<A NAME="1463"></A><BR>So subtly into the tiny parts thereof,
<A NAME="1464"></A><BR>Shoves it and pushes, as wind the ship and sails.
<A NAME="1465"></A><BR>The same doth happen in all directions forth:
<A NAME="1466"></A><BR>From whatso side a space is made a void,
<A NAME="1467"></A><BR>Whether from crosswise or above, forthwith
<A NAME="1468"></A><BR>The neighbour particles are borne along
<A NAME="1469"></A><BR>Into the vacuum; for of verity,
<A NAME="1470"></A><BR>They're set a-going by poundings from elsewhere,
<A NAME="1471"></A><BR>Nor by themselves of own accord can they
<A NAME="1472"></A><BR>Rise upwards into the air. Again, all things
<A NAME="1473"></A><BR>Must in their framework hold some air, because
<A NAME="1474"></A><BR>They are of framework porous, and the air
<A NAME="1475"></A><BR>Encompasses and borders on all things.
<A NAME="1476"></A><BR>Thus, then, this air in iron so deeply stored
<A NAME="1477"></A><BR>Is tossed evermore in vexed motion,
<A NAME="1478"></A><BR>And therefore drubs upon the ring sans doubt
<A NAME="1479"></A><BR>And shakes it up inside....
<A NAME="1480"></A><BR><BR>In sooth, that ring is thither borne along
<A NAME="1481"></A><BR>To where 'thas once plunged headlong- thither, lo,
<A NAME="1482"></A><BR>Unto the void whereto it took its start.
<A NAME="1483"></A><BR><BR>It happens, too, at times that nature of iron
<A NAME="1484"></A><BR>Shrinks from this stone away, accustomed
<A NAME="1485"></A><BR>By turns to flee and follow. Yea, I've seen
<A NAME="1486"></A><BR>Those Samothracian iron rings leap up,
<A NAME="1487"></A><BR>And iron filings in the brazen bowls
<A NAME="1488"></A><BR>Seethe furiously, when underneath was set
<A NAME="1489"></A><BR>The magnet stone. So strongly iron seems
<A NAME="1490"></A><BR>To crave to flee that rock. Such discord great
<A NAME="1491"></A><BR>Is gendered by the interposed brass,
<A NAME="1492"></A><BR>Because, forsooth, when first the tide of brass
<A NAME="1493"></A><BR>Hath seized upon and held possession of
<A NAME="1494"></A><BR>The iron's open passage-ways, thereafter
<A NAME="1495"></A><BR>Cometh the tide of the stone, and in that iron
<A NAME="1496"></A><BR>Findeth all spaces full, nor now hath holes
<A NAME="1497"></A><BR>To swim through, as before. 'Tis thus constrained
<A NAME="1498"></A><BR>With its own current 'gainst the iron's fabric
<A NAME="1499"></A><BR>To dash and beat; by means whereof it spews
<A NAME="1500"></A><BR>Forth from itself- and through the brass stirs up-
<A NAME="1501"></A><BR>The things which otherwise without the brass
<A NAME="1502"></A><BR>It sucks into itself. In these affairs
<A NAME="1503"></A><BR>Marvel thou not that from this stone the tide
<A NAME="1504"></A><BR>Prevails not likewise other things to move
<A NAME="1505"></A><BR>With its own blows: for some stand firm by weight,
<A NAME="1506"></A><BR>As gold; and some cannot be moved forever,
<A NAME="1507"></A><BR>Because so porous in the
