<A NAME="10"></A><B>Proem</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>O who can build with puissant breast a song
<A NAME="12"></A><BR>Worthy the majesty of these great finds?
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>Or who in words so strong that he can frame
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>The fit laudations for deserts of him
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>Who left us heritors of such vast prizes,
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>By his own breast discovered and sought out?-
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>There shall be none, methinks, of mortal stock.
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>For if must needs be named for him the name
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>Demanded by the now known majesty
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>Of these high matters, then a god was he,-
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>Hear me, illustrious Memmius- a god;
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>Who first and chief found out that plan of life
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>Which now is called philosophy, and who
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>By cunning craft, out of such mighty waves,
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>Out of such mighty darkness, moored life
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>In havens so serene, in light so clear.
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>Compare those old discoveries divine
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>Of others: lo, according to the tale,
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>Ceres established for mortality
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>The grain, and Bacchus juice of vine-born grape,
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>Though life might yet without these things abide,
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>Even as report saith now some peoples live.
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>But man's well-being was impossible
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>Without a breast all free. Wherefore the more
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>That man doth justly seem to us a god,
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>From whom sweet solaces of life, afar
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>Distributed o'er populous domains,
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>Now soothe the minds of men. But if thou thinkest
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>Labours of Hercules excel the same,
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>Much farther from true reasoning thou farest.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>For what could hurt us now that mighty maw
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>Of Nemeaean Lion, or what the Boar
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>Who bristled in Arcadia? Or, again,
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>O what could Cretan Bull, or Hydra, pest
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>Of Lerna, fenced with vipers venomous?
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>Or what the triple-breasted power of her
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>The three-fold Geryon...
<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>The sojourners in the Stymphalian fens
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>So dreadfully offend us, or the Steeds
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>Of Thracian Diomedes breathing fire
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>From out their nostrils off along the zones
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>Bistonian and Ismarian? And the Snake,
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>The dread fierce gazer, guardian of the golden
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>And gleaming apples of the Hesperides,
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>Coiled round the tree-trunk with tremendous bulk,
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>O what, again, could he inflict on us
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>Along the Atlantic shore and wastes of sea?-
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>Where neither one of us approacheth nigh
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>Nor no barbarian ventures. And the rest
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>Of all those monsters slain, even if alive,
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>Unconquered still, what injury could they do?
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>None, as I guess. For so the glutted earth
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>Swarms even now with savage beasts, even now
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>Is filled with anxious terrors through the woods
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>And mighty mountains and the forest deeps-
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>Quarters 'tis ours in general to avoid.
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>But lest the breast be purged, what conflicts then,
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>What perils, must bosom, in our own despite!
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>O then how great and keen the cares of lust
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>That split the man distraught! How great the fears!
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>And lo, the pride, grim greed, and wantonness-
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>How great the slaughters in their train! and lo,
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>Debaucheries and every breed of sloth!
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>Therefore that man who subjugated these,
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>And from the mind expelled, by words indeed,
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>Not arms, O shall it not be seemly him
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>To dignify by ranking with the gods?-
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>And all the more since he was wont to give,
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>Concerning the immortal gods themselves,
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>Many pronouncements with a tongue divine,
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>And to unfold by his pronouncements all
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>The nature of the world.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="83"></A><B>Argument of the Book and New Proem Against Teleological 
<A NAME="84"></A>Concept</B>

<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>And walking now
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>In his own footprints, I do follow through
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>His reasonings, and with pronouncements teach
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>The covenant whereby all things are framed,
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>How under that covenant they must abide
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>Nor ever prevail to abrogate the aeons'
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>Inexorable decrees- how (as we've found),
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>In class of mortal objects, o'er all else,
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>The mind exists of earth-born frame create
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>And impotent unscathed to abide
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>Across the mighty aeons, and how come
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>In sleep those idol-apparitions
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>That so befool intelligence when we
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>Do seem to view a man whom life has left.
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>Thus far we've gone; the order of my plan
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>Hath brought me now unto the point where I
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>Must make report how, too, the universe
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>Consists of mortal body, born in time,
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>And in what modes that congregated stuff
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>Established itself as earth and sky,
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>Ocean, and stars, and sun, and ball of moon;
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>And then what living creatures rose from out
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>The old telluric places, and what ones
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>Were never born at all; and in what mode
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>The human race began to name its things
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>And use the varied speech from man to man;
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>And in what modes hath bosomed in their breasts
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>That awe of gods, which halloweth in all lands
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>Fanes, altars, groves, lakes, idols of the gods.
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>Also I shall untangle by what power
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>The steersman Nature guides the sun's courses,
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>And the meanderings of the moon, lest we,
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>Percase, should fancy that of own free will
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>They circle their perennial courses round,
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>Timing their motions for increase of crops
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>And living creatures, or lest we should think
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>They roll along by any plan of gods.
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>For even those men who have learned full well
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>That godheads lead a long life free of care,
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>If yet meanwhile they wonder by what plan
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>Things can go on (and chiefly yon high things
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>Observed o'erhead on the ethereal coasts),
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>Again are hurried back unto the fears
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>Of old religion and adopt again
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>Harsh masters, deemed almighty- wretched men,
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>Unwitting what can be and what cannot,
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>And by what law to each its scope prescribed,
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>Its boundary stone that clings so deep in Time.
<A NAME="133"></A><BR><BR>But for the rest, lest we delay thee here
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>Longer by empty promises- behold,
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>Before all else, the seas, the lands, the sky:
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>O Memmius, their threefold nature, lo,
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>Their bodies three, three aspects so unlike,
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>Three frames so vast, a single day shall give
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>Unto annihilation! Then shall crash
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>That massive form and fabric of the world
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>Sustained so many aeons! Nor do I
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>Fail to perceive how strange and marvellous
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>This fact must strike the intellect of man,-
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>Annihilation of the sky and earth
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>That is to be,- and with what toil of words
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>'Tis mine to prove the same; as happens oft
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>When once ye offer to man's listening ears
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>Something before unheard of, but may not
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>Subject it to the view of eyes for him
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>Nor put it into hand- the sight and touch,
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>Whereby the opened highways of belief
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>Lead most directly into human breast
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>And regions of intelligence. But yet
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>I will speak out. The fact itself, perchance,
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>Will force belief in these my words, and thou
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>Mayst see, in little time, tremendously
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>With risen commotions of the lands all things
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>Quaking to pieces- which afar from us
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>May she, the steersman Nature, guide: and may
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>Reason, O rather than the fact itself,
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>Persuade us that all things can be o'erthrown
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>And sink with awful-sounding breakage down!
<A NAME="163"></A><BR><BR>But ere on this I take a step to utter
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>Oracles holier and soundlier based
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>Than ever the Pythian pronounced for men
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>From out the tripod and the Delphian laurel,
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>I will unfold for thee with learned words
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>Many a consolation, lest perchance,
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>Still bridled by religion, thou suppose
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>Lands, sun, and sky, sea, constellations, moon,
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>Must dure forever, as of frame divine-
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>And so conclude that it is just that those,
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>(After the manner of the Giants), should all
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>Pay the huge penalties for monstrous crime,
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>Who by their reasonings do overshake
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>The ramparts of the universe and wish
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>There to put out the splendid sun of heaven,
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>Branding with mortal talk immortal things-
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>Though these same things are even so far removed
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>From any touch of deity and seem
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>So far unworthy of numbering with the gods,
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>That well they may be thought to furnish rather
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>A goodly instance of the sort of things
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>That lack the living motion, living sense.
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>For sure 'tis quite beside the mark to think
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>That judgment and the nature of the mind
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>In any kind of body can exist-
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>Just as in ether can't exist a tree,
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>Nor clouds in the salt sea, nor in the fields
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>Can fishes live, nor blood in timber be,
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>Nor sap in boulders: fixed and arranged
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>Where everything may grow and have its place.
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>Thus nature of mind cannot arise alone
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>Without the body, nor have its being far
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>From thews and blood. Yet if 'twere possible?-
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>Much rather might this very power of mind
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>Be in the head, the shoulders, or the heels,
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>And, born in any part soever, yet
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>In the same man, in the same vessel abide
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>But since within this body even of ours
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>Stands fixed and appears arranged sure
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>Where soul and mind can each exist and grow,
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>Deny we must the more that they can dure
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>Outside the body and the breathing form
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>In rotting clods of earth, in the sun's fire,
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>In water, or in ether's skiey coasts.
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>Therefore these things no whit are furnished
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>With sense divine, since never can they be
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>With life-force quickened.
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>Likewise, thou canst ne'er
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>Believe the sacred seats of gods are here
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>In any regions of this mundane world;
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>Indeed, the nature of the gods, so subtle,
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>So far removed from these our senses, scarce
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>Is seen even by intelligence of mind.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>And since they've ever eluded touch and thrust
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>Of human hands, they cannot reach to grasp
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>Aught tangible to us. For what may not
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>Itself be touched in turn can never touch.
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>Wherefore, besides, also their seats must be
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>Unlike these seats of ours,- even subtle too,
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>As meet for subtle essence- as I'll prove
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>Hereafter unto thee with large discourse.
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>Further, to say that for the sake of men
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>They willed to prepare this world's magnificence,
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>And that 'tis therefore duty and behoof
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>To praise the work of gods as worthy praise,
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>And that 'tis sacrilege for men to shake
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>Ever by any force from out their seats
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>What hath been stablished by the Forethought old
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>To everlasting for races of mankind,
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>And that 'tis sacrilege to assault by words
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>And overtopple all from base to beam,-
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>Memmius, such notions to concoct and pile,
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>Is verily- to dote. Our gratefulness,
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>O what emoluments could it confer
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>Upon Immortals and upon the Blessed
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>That they should take a step to manage aught
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>For sake of us? Or what new factor could,
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>After so long a time, inveigle them-
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>The hitherto reposeful- to desire
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>To change their former life? For rather he
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>Whom old things chafe seems likely to rejoice
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>At new; but one that in fore-passed time
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>Hath chanced upon no ill, through goodly years.
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>O what could ever enkindle in such an one
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>Passion for strange experiment? Or what
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>The evil for us, if we had ne'er been born?-
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>As though, forsooth, in darkling realms and woe
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>Our life were lying till should dawn at last
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>The day-spring of creation! Whosoever
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>Hath been begotten wills perforce to stay
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>In life, so long as fond delight detains;
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>But whoso ne'er hath tasted love of life,
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>And ne'er was in the count of living things,
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>What hurts it him that he was never born?
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>Whence, further, first was planted in the gods
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>The archetype for gendering the world
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>And the fore-notion of what man is like,
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>So that they knew and pre-conceived with mind
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>Just what they wished to make? Or how were known
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>Ever the energies of primal germs,
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>And what those germs, by interchange of place,
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>Could thus produce, if nature's self had not
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>Given example for creating all?
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>For in such wise primordials of things,
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>Many in many modes, astir by blows
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>From immemorial aeons, in motion too
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>By their own weights, have evermore been wont
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>To be so borne along and in all modes
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>To meet together and to try all sorts
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>Which, by combining one with other, they
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>Are powerful to create, that thus it is
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>No marvel now, if they have also fallen
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>Into arrangements such, and if they've passed
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>Into vibrations such, as those whereby
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>This sum of things is carried on to-day
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>By fixed renewal. But knew I never what
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>The seeds primordial were, yet would I dare
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>This to affirm, even from deep judgments based
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>Upon the ways and conduct of the skies-
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>This to maintain by many a fact besides-
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>That in no wise the nature of all things
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>For us was fashioned by a power divine-
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>So great the faults it stands encumbered with.
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>First, mark all regions which are overarched
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>By the prodigious reaches of the sky:
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>One yawning part thereof the mountain-chains
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>And forests of the beasts do have and hold;
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>And cliffs, and desert fens, and wastes of sea
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>(Which sunder afar the beaches of the lands)
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>Possess it merely; and, again, thereof
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>Well-nigh two-thirds intolerable heat
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>And a perpetual fall of frost doth rob
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>From mortal kind. And what is left to till,
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>Even that the force of Nature would o'errun
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>With brambles, did not human force oppose,-
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>Long wont for livelihood to groan and sweat
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>Over the two-pronged mattock and to cleave
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>The soil in twain by pressing on the plough.
<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR>Unless, by the ploughshare turning the fruitful 
<A NAME="302"></A>clods
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>And kneading the mould, we quicken into birth,
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>The crops spontaneously could not come up
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>Into the free bright air. Even then sometimes,
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>When things acquired by the sternest toil
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>Are now in leaf, are now in blossom all,
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>Either the skiey sun with baneful heats
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>Parches, or sudden rains or chilling rime
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>Destroys, or flaws of winds with furious whirl
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>Torment and twist. Beside these matters, why
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>Doth Nature feed and foster on land and sea
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>The dreadful breed of savage beasts, the foes
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>Of the human clan? Why do the seasons bring
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>Distempers with them? Wherefore stalks at large
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>Death, so untimely? Then, again, the babe,
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>Like to the castaway of the raging surf,
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>Lies naked on the ground, speechless, in want
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>Of every help for life, when Nature first
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>Hath poured him forth upon the shores of light
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>With birth-pangs from within the mother's womb,
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>And with a plaintive wail he fills the place,-
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>As well befitting one for whom remains
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>In life a journey through so many ills.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>But all the flocks and herds and all wild beasts
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>Come forth and grow, nor need the little rattles,
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>Nor must be treated to the humouring nurse's
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>Dear, broken chatter; nor seek they divers clothes
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>To suit the changing skies; nor need, in fine,
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>Nor arms, nor lofty ramparts, wherewithal
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>Their own to guard- because the earth herself
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>And Nature, artificer of the world, bring forth
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>Aboundingly all things for all.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="334"></A><B>The World is Not Eternal</B>

<A NAME="335"></A><BR><BR>And first,
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>Since body of earth and water, air's light breath,
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>And fiery exhalations (of which four
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>This sum of things is seen to be compact)
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>So all have birth and perishable frame,
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>Thus the whole nature of the world itself
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>Must be conceived as perishable too.
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>For, verily, those things of which we see
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>The parts and members to have birth in time
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>And perishable shapes, those same we mark
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>To be invariably born in time
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>And born to die. And therefore when I see
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>The mightiest members and the parts of this
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>Our world consumed and begot again,
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>'Tis mine to know that also sky above
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>And earth beneath began of old in time
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>And shall in time go under to disaster.
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>And lest in these affairs thou deemest me
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>To have seized upon this point by sleight to serve
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>My own caprice- because I have assumed
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>That earth and fire are mortal things indeed,
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>And have not doubted water and the air
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>Both perish too and have affirmed the same
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>To be again begotten and wax big-
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>Mark well the argument: in first place, lo,
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>Some certain parts of earth, grievously parched
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>By unremitting suns, and trampled on
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>By a vast throng of feet, exhale abroad
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>A powdery haze and flying clouds of dust,
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>Which the stout winds disperse in the whole air.
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>A part, moreover, of her sod and soil
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>Is summoned to inundation by the rains;
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>And rivers graze and gouge the banks away.
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>Besides, whatever takes a part its own
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>In fostering and increasing aught...
<A NAME="370"></A><BR><BR>Is rendered back; and since, beyond a doubt,
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>Earth, the all-mother, is beheld to be
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>Likewise the common sepulchre of things,
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>Therefore thou seest her minished of her plenty,
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>And then again augmented with new growth.
<A NAME="375"></A><BR><BR>And for the rest, that sea, and streams, and 
<A NAME="376"></A>springs
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>Forever with new waters overflow
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>And that perennially the fluids well.
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>Needeth no words- the mighty flux itself
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>Of multitudinous waters round about
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>Declareth this. But whatso water first
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>Streams up is ever straightway carried off,
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>And thus it comes to pass that all in all
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>There is no overflow; in part because
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>The burly winds (that over-sweep amain)
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>And skiey sun (that with his rays dissolves)
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>Do minish the level seas; in part because
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>The water is diffused underground
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>Through all the lands. The brine is filtered off,
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>And then the liquid stuff seeps back again
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>And all re-gathers at the river-heads,
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>Whence in fresh-water currents on it flows
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>Over the lands, adown the channels which
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>Were cleft erstwhile and erstwhile bore along
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>The liquid-footed floods.
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>Now, then, of air
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>I'll speak, which hour by hour in all its body
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>Is changed innumerably. For whatso'er
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>Streams up in dust or vapour off of things,
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>The same is all and always borne along
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>Into the mighty ocean of the air;
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>And did not air in turn restore to things
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>Bodies, and thus recruit them as they stream,
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>All things by this time had resolved been
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>And changed into air. Therefore it never
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>Ceases to be engendered off of things
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>And to return to things, since verily
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>In constant flux do all things stream.
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>Likewise,
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>The abounding well-spring of the liquid light,
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>The ethereal sun, doth flood the heaven o'er
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>With constant flux of radiance ever new,
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>And with fresh light supplies the place of light,
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>Upon the instant. For whatever effulgence
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>Hath first streamed off, no matter where it falls,
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>Is lost unto the sun. And this 'tis thine
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>To know from these examples: soon as clouds
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>Have first begun to under-pass the sun,
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>And, as it were, to rend the days of light
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>In twain, at once the lower part of them
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>Is lost entire, and earth is overcast
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>Where'er the thunderheads are rolled along-
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>So know thou mayst that things forever need
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>A fresh replenishment of gleam and glow,
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>And each effulgence, foremost flashed forth,
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>Perisheth one by one. Nor otherwise
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>Can things be seen in sunlight, lest alway
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>The fountain-head of light supply new light.
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>Indeed your earthly beacons of the night,
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>The hanging lampions and the torches, bright
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>With darting gleams and dense with livid soot,
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>Do hurry in like manner to supply
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>With ministering heat new light amain;
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>Are all alive to quiver with their fires,-
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>Are so alive, that thus the light ne'er leaves
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>The spots it shines on, as if rent in twain:
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>So speedily is its destruction veiled
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>By the swift birth of flame from all the fires.
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>Thus, then, we must suppose that sun and moon
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>And stars dart forth their light from under-births
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>Ever and ever new, and whatso flames
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>First rise do perish always one by one-
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>Lest, haply, thou shouldst think they each endure
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>Inviolable.
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>Again, perceivest not
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>How stones are also conquered by Time?-
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>Not how the lofty towers ruin down,
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>And boulders crumble?- Not how shrines of gods
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>And idols crack outworn?- Nor how indeed
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>The holy Influence hath yet no power
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>There to postpone the Terminals of Fate,
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>Or headway make 'gainst Nature's fixed decrees?
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>Again, behold we not the monuments
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>Of heroes, now in ruins, asking us,
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>In their turn likewise, if we don't believe
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>They also age with eld? Behold we not
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>The rended basalt ruining amain
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>Down from the lofty mountains, powerless
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>To dure and dree the mighty forces there
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>Of finite time?- for they would never fall
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>Rended asudden, if from infinite Past
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>They had prevailed against all engin'ries
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>Of the assaulting aeons, with no crash.
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>Again, now look at This, which round, above,
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>Contains the whole earth in its one embrace:
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>If from itself it procreates all things-
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>As some men tell- and takes them to itself
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>When once destroyed, entirely must it be
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>Of mortal birth and body; for whate'er
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>From out itself giveth to other things
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>Increase and food, the same perforce must be
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>Minished, and then recruited when it takes
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>Things back into itself.
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>Besides all this,
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>If there had been no origin-in-birth
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>Of lands and sky, and they had ever been
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>The everlasting, why, ere Theban war
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>And obsequies of Troy, have other bards
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>Not also chanted other high affairs?
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>Whither have sunk so oft so many deeds
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>Of heroes? Why do those deeds live no more,
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>Ingrafted in eternal monuments
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>Of glory? Verily, I guess, because
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>The Sum is new, and of a recent date
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>The nature of our universe, and had
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>Not long ago its own exordium.
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>Wherefore, even now some arts are being still
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>Refined, still increased: now unto ships
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>Is being added many a new device;
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>And but the other day musician-folk
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>Gave birth to melic sounds of organing;
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>And, then, this nature, this account of things
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>Hath been discovered latterly, and I
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>Myself have been discovered only now,
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>As first among the first, able to turn
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>The same into ancestral Roman speech.
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>Yet if, percase, thou deemest that ere this
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>Existed all things even the same, but that
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>Perished the cycles of the human race
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>In fiery exhalations, or cities fell
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>By some tremendous quaking of the world,
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>Or rivers in fury, after constant rains,
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>Had plunged forth across the lands of earth
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>And whelmed the towns- then, all the more must thou
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>Confess, defeated by the argument,
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>That there shall be annihilation too
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>Of lands and sky. For at a time when things
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>Were being taxed by maladies so great,
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>And so great perils, if some cause more fell
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>Had then assailed them, far and wide they would
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>Have gone to disaster and supreme collapse.
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>And by no other reasoning are we
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>Seen to be mortal, save that all of us
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>Sicken in turn with those same maladies
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>With which have sickened in the past those men
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>Whom Nature hath removed from life.
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>Again,
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>Whatever abides eternal must indeed
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>Either repel all strokes, because 'tis made
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>Of solid body, and permit no entrance
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>Of aught with power to sunder from within
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>The parts compact- as are those seeds of stuff
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>Whose nature we've exhibited before;
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>Or else be able to endure through time
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>For this: because they are from blows exempt,
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>As is the void, the which abides untouched,
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>Unsmit by any stroke; or else because
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>There is no room around, whereto things can,
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>As 'twere, depart in dissolution all-
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>Even as the sum of sums eternal is,
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>Without or place beyond whereto things may
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>Asunder fly, or bodies which can smite,
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>And thus dissolve them by the blows of might.
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>But not of solid body, as I've shown,
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>Exists the nature of the world, because
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>In things is intermingled there a void;
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>Nor is the world yet as the void, nor are,
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>Moreover, bodies lacking which, percase,
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>Rising from out the infinite, can fell
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>With fury-whirlwinds all this sum of things,
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>Or bring upon them other cataclysm
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>Of peril strange; and yonder, too, abides
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>The infinite space and the profound abyss-
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>Whereinto, lo, the ramparts of the world
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>Can yet be shivered. Or some other power
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>Can pound upon them till they perish all.
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>Thus is the door of doom, O nowise barred
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>Against the sky, against the sun and earth
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>And deep-sea waters, but wide open stands
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>And gloats upon them, monstrous and agape.
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>Wherefore, again, 'tis needful to confess
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>That these same things are born in time; for things
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>Which are of mortal body could indeed
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>Never from infinite past until to-day
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>Have spurned the multitudinous assaults
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>Of the immeasurable aeons old.
<A NAME="557"></A><BR><BR>Again, since battle so fiercely one with other
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>The four most mighty members the world,
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>Aroused in an all unholy war,
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>Seest not that there may be for them an end
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>Of the long strife?- Or when the skiey sun
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>And all the heat have won dominion o'er
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>The sucked-up waters all?- And this they try
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>Still to accomplish, though as yet they fail,-
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>For so aboundingly the streams supply
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>New store of waters that 'tis rather they
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>Who menace the world with inundations vast
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>From forth the unplumbed chasms of the sea.
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>But vain- since winds (that over-sweep amain)
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>And skiey sun (that with his rays dissolves)
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>Do minish the level seas and trust their power
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>To dry up all, before the waters can
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>Arrive at the end of their endeavouring.
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>Breathing such vasty warfare, they contend
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>In balanced strife the one with other still
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>Concerning mighty issues- though indeed
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>The fire was once the more victorious,
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>And once- as goes the tale- the water won
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>A kingdom in the fields. For fire o'ermastered
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>And licked up many things and burnt away,
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>What time the impetuous horses of the Sun
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>Snatched Phaethon headlong from his skiey road
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>Down the whole ether and over all the lands.
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>But the omnipotent Father in keen wrath
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>Then with the sudden smite of thunderbolt
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>Did hurl the mighty-minded hero off
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>Those horses to the earth. And Sol, his sire,
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>Meeting him as he fell, caught up in hand
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>The ever-blazing lampion of the world,
<A NAME="590"></A><BR>And drave together the pell-mell horses there
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>And yoked them all a-tremble, and amain,
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>Steering them over along their own old road,
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>Restored the cosmos- as forsooth we hear
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>From songs of ancient poets of the Greeks-
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>A tale too far away from truth, meseems.
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>For fire can win when from the infinite
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>Has risen a larger throng of particles
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>Of fiery stuff; and then its powers succumb,
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>Somehow subdued again, or else at last
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>It shrivels in torrid atmospheres the world.
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>And whilom water too began to win-
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>As goes the story- when it overwhelmed
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>The lives of men with billows; and thereafter,
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>When all that force of water-stuff which forth
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>From out the infinite had risen up
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>Did now retire, as somehow turned aside,
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>The rain-storms stopped, and streams their fury 
<A NAME="608"></A>checked.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="609"></A><B>Formation of the World and Astronomical Questions</B>

<A NAME="610"></A><BR><BR>But in what modes that conflux of first-stuff
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>Did found the multitudinous universe
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>Of earth, and sky, and the unfathomed deeps
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>Of ocean, and courses of the sun and moon,
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>I'll now in order tell. For of a truth
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>Neither by counsel did the primal germs
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>'Stablish themselves, as by keen act of mind,
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>Each in its proper place; nor did they make,
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>Forsooth, a compact how each germ should move;
<A NAME="619"></A><BR>But, lo, because primordials of things,
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>Many in many modes, astir by blows
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>From immemorial aeons, in motion too
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>By their own weights, have evermore been wont
<A NAME="623"></A><BR>To be so borne along and in all modes
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>To meet together and to try all sorts
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>Which, by combining one with other, they
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>Are powerful to create: because of this
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>It comes to pass that those primordials,
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>Diffused far and wide through mighty aeons,
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>The while they unions try, and motions too,
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>Of every kind, meet at the last amain,
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>And so become oft the commencements fit
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>Of mighty things- earth, sea, and sky, and race
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>Of living creatures.
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>In that long-ago
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>The wheel of the sun could nowhere be discerned
<A NAME="636"></A><BR>Flying far up with its abounding blaze,
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>Nor constellations of the mighty world,
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>Nor ocean, nor heaven, nor even earth nor air.
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>Nor aught of things like unto things of ours
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>Could then be seen- but only some strange storm
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>And a prodigious hurly-burly mass
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>Compounded of all kinds of primal germs,
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>Whose battling discords in disorder kept
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>Interstices, and paths, coherencies,
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>And weights, and blows, encounterings, and motions,
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>Because, by reason of their forms unlike
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>And varied shapes, they could not all thuswise
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>Remain conjoined nor harmoniously
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>Have interplay of movements. But from there
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>Portions began to fly asunder, and like
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>With like to join, and to block out a world,
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>And to divide its members and dispose
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>Its mightier parts- that is, to set secure
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>The lofty heavens from the lands, and cause
<A NAME="655"></A><BR>The sea to spread with waters separate,
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>And fires of ether separate and pure
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>Likewise to congregate apart.
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>For, lo,
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>First came together the earthy particles
<A NAME="660"></A><BR>(As being heavy and intertangled) there
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>In the mid-region, and all began to take
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>The lowest abodes; and ever the more they got
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>One with another intertangled, the more
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>They pressed from out their mass those particles
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>Which were to form the sea, the stars, the sun,
<A NAME="666"></A><BR>And moon, and ramparts of the mighty world-
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>For these consist of seeds more smooth and round
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>And of much smaller elements than earth.
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>And thus it was that ether, fraught with fire,
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>First broke away from out the earthen parts,
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>Athrough the innumerable pores of earth,
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>And raised itself aloft, and with itself
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>Bore lightly off the many starry fires;
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>And not far otherwise we often see
<A NAME="675"></A><BR><BR>And the still lakes and the perennial streams
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>Exhale a mist, and even as earth herself
<A NAME="677"></A><BR>Is seen at times to smoke, when first at dawn
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>The light of the sun, the many-rayed, begins
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>To redden into gold, over the grass
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>Begemmed with dew. When all of these are brought
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>Together overhead, the clouds on high
<A NAME="682"></A><BR>With now concreted body weave a cover
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>Beneath the heavens. And thuswise ether too,
<A NAME="684"></A><BR>Light and diffusive, with concreted body
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>On all sides spread, on all sides bent itself
<A NAME="686"></A><BR>Into a dome, and, far and wide diffused
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>On unto every region on all sides,
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>Thus hedged all else within its greedy clasp.
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>Hard upon ether came the origins
<A NAME="690"></A><BR>Of sun and moon, whose globes revolve in air
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>Midway between the earth and mightiest ether,-
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>For neither took them, since they weighed too little
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>To sink and settle, but too much to glide
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>Along the upmost shores; and yet they are
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>In such a wise midway between the twain
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>As ever to whirl their living bodies round,
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>And ever to dure as parts of the wide Whole;
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>In the same fashion as certain members may
<A NAME="699"></A><BR>In us remain at rest, whilst others move.
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>When, then, these substances had been withdrawn,
<A NAME="701"></A><BR>Amain the earth, where now extend the vast
<A NAME="702"></A><BR>Cerulean zones of all the level seas,
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>Caved in, and down along the hollows poured
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>The whirlpools of her brine; and day by day
<A NAME="705"></A><BR>The more the tides of ether and rays of sun
<A NAME="706"></A><BR>On every side constrained into one mass
<A NAME="707"></A><BR>The earth by lashing it again, again,
<A NAME="708"></A><BR>Upon its outer edges (so that then,
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>Being thus beat upon, 'twas all condensed
<A NAME="710"></A><BR>About its proper centre), ever the more
<A NAME="711"></A><BR>The salty sweat, from out its body squeezed,
<A NAME="712"></A><BR>Augmented ocean and the fields of foam
<A NAME="713"></A><BR>By seeping through its frame, and all the more
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>Those many particles of heat and air
<A NAME="715"></A><BR>Escaping, began to fly aloft, and form,
<A NAME="716"></A><BR>By condensation there afar from earth,
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>The high refulgent circuits of the heavens.
<A NAME="718"></A><BR>The plains began to sink, and windy slopes
<A NAME="719"></A><BR>Of the high mountains to increase; for rocks
<A NAME="720"></A><BR>Could not subside, nor all the parts of ground
<A NAME="721"></A><BR>Settle alike to one same level there.
<A NAME="722"></A><BR><BR>Thus, then, the massy weight of earth stood 
<A NAME="723"></A>firm
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>With now concreted body, when (as 'twere)
<A NAME="725"></A><BR>All of the slime of the world, heavy and gross,
<A NAME="726"></A><BR>Had run together and settled at the bottom,
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>Like lees or bilge. Then ocean, then the air,
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>Then ether herself, the fraught-with-fire, were 
<A NAME="729"></A>all
<A NAME="730"></A><BR>Left with their liquid bodies pure and free,
<A NAME="731"></A><BR>And each more lighter than the next below;
<A NAME="732"></A><BR>And ether, most light and liquid of the three,
<A NAME="733"></A><BR>Floats on above the long aerial winds,
<A NAME="734"></A><BR>Nor with the brawling of the winds of air
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>Mingles its liquid body. It doth leave
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>All there- those under-realms below her heights-
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>There to be overset in whirlwinds wild,-
<A NAME="738"></A><BR>Doth leave all there to brawl in wayward gusts,
<A NAME="739"></A><BR>Whilst, gliding with a fixed impulse still,
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>Itself it bears its fires along. For, lo,
<A NAME="741"></A><BR>That ether can flow thus steadily on, on,
<A NAME="742"></A><BR>With one unaltered urge, the Pontus proves-
<A NAME="743"></A><BR>That sea which floweth forth with fixed tides,
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>Keeping one onward tenor as it glides.
<A NAME="745"></A><BR><BR>And that the earth may there abide at rest
<A NAME="746"></A><BR>In the mid-region of the world, it needs
<A NAME="747"></A><BR>Must vanish bit by bit in weight and lessen,
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>And have another substance underneath,
<A NAME="749"></A><BR>Conjoined to it from its earliest age
<A NAME="750"></A><BR>In linked unison with the vasty world's
<A NAME="751"></A><BR>Realms of the air in which it roots and lives.
<A NAME="752"></A><BR>On this account, the earth is not a load,
<A NAME="753"></A><BR>Nor presses down on winds of air beneath;
<A NAME="754"></A><BR>Even as unto a man his members be
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>Without all weight- the head is not a load
<A NAME="756"></A><BR>Unto the neck; nor do we feel the whole
<A NAME="757"></A><BR>Weight of the body to centre in the feet.
<A NAME="758"></A><BR>But whatso weights come on us from without,
<A NAME="759"></A><BR>Weights laid upon us, these harass and chafe,
<A NAME="760"></A><BR>Though often far lighter. For to such degree
<A NAME="761"></A><BR>It matters always what the innate powers
<A NAME="762"></A><BR>Of any given thing may be. The earth
<A NAME="763"></A><BR>Was, then, no alien substance fetched amain,
<A NAME="764"></A><BR>And from no alien firmament cast down
<A NAME="765"></A><BR>On alien air; but was conceived, like air,
<A NAME="766"></A><BR>In the first origin of this the world,
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>As a fixed portion of the same, as now
<A NAME="768"></A><BR>Our members are seen to be a part of us.
<A NAME="769"></A><BR><BR>Besides, the earth, when of a sudden shook
<A NAME="770"></A><BR>By the big thunder, doth with her motion shake
<A NAME="771"></A><BR>All that's above her- which she ne'er could do
<A NAME="772"></A><BR>By any means, were earth not bounden fast
<A NAME="773"></A><BR>Unto the great world's realms of air and sky:
<A NAME="774"></A><BR>For they cohere together with common roots,
<A NAME="775"></A><BR>Conjoined both, even from their earliest age,
<A NAME="776"></A><BR>In linked unison. Aye, seest thou not
<A NAME="777"></A><BR>That this most subtle energy of soul
<A NAME="778"></A><BR>Supports our body, though so heavy a weight,-
<A NAME="779"></A><BR>Because, indeed, 'tis with it so conjoined
<A NAME="780"></A><BR>In linked unison? What power, in sum,
<A NAME="781"></A><BR>Can raise with agile leap our body aloft,
<A NAME="782"></A><BR>Save energy of mind which steers the limbs?
<A NAME="783"></A><BR>Now seest thou not how powerful may be
<A NAME="784"></A><BR>A subtle nature, when conjoined it is
<A NAME="785"></A><BR>With heavy body, as air is with the earth
<A NAME="786"></A><BR>Conjoined, and energy of mind with us?
<A NAME="787"></A><BR>Now let's us sing what makes the stars to move.
<A NAME="788"></A><BR>In first place, if the mighty sphere of heaven
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>Revolveth round, then needs we must aver
<A NAME="790"></A><BR>That on the upper and the under pole
<A NAME="791"></A><BR>Presses a certain air, and from without
<A NAME="792"></A><BR>Confines them and encloseth at each end;
<A NAME="793"></A><BR>And that, moreover, another air above
<A NAME="794"></A><BR>Streams on athwart the top of the sphere and tends
<A NAME="795"></A><BR>In same direction as are rolled along
<A NAME="796"></A><BR>The glittering stars of the eternal world;
<A NAME="797"></A><BR>Or that another still streams on below
<A NAME="798"></A><BR>To whirl the sphere from under up and on
<A NAME="799"></A><BR>In opposite direction- as we see
<A NAME="800"></A><BR>The rivers turn the wheels and water-scoops.
<A NAME="801"></A><BR>It may be also that the heavens do all
<A NAME="802"></A><BR>Remain at rest, whilst yet are borne along
<A NAME="803"></A><BR>The lucid constellations; either because
<A NAME="804"></A><BR>Swift tides of ether are by sky enclosed,
<A NAME="805"></A><BR>And whirl around, seeking a passage out,
<A NAME="806"></A><BR>And everywhere make roll the starry fires
<A NAME="807"></A><BR>Through the Summanian regions of the sky;
<A NAME="808"></A><BR>Or else because some air, streaming along
<A NAME="809"></A><BR>From an eternal quarter off beyond,
<A NAME="810"></A><BR>Whileth the driven fires, or, then, because
<A NAME="811"></A><BR>The fires themselves have power to creep along,
<A NAME="812"></A><BR>Going wherever their food invites and calls,
<A NAME="813"></A><BR>And feeding their flaming bodies everywhere
<A NAME="814"></A><BR>Throughout the sky. Yet which of these is cause
<A NAME="815"></A><BR>In this our world 'tis hard to say for sure;
<A NAME="816"></A><BR>But what can be throughout the universe,
<A NAME="817"></A><BR>In divers worlds on divers plan create,
<A NAME="818"></A><BR>This only do I show, and follow on
<A NAME="819"></A><BR>To assign unto the motions of the stars
<A NAME="820"></A><BR>Even several causes which 'tis possible
<A NAME="821"></A><BR>Exist throughout the universal All;
<A NAME="822"></A><BR>Of which yet one must be the cause even here
<A NAME="823"></A><BR>Which maketh motion for our constellations.
<A NAME="824"></A><BR>Yet to decide which one of them it be
<A NAME="825"></A><BR>Is not the least the business of a man
<A NAME="826"></A><BR>Advancing step by cautious step, as I.
<A NAME="827"></A><BR><BR>Nor can the sun's wheel larger be by much
<A NAME="828"></A><BR>Nor its own blaze much less than either seems
<A NAME="829"></A><BR>Unto our senses. For from whatso spaces
<A NAME="830"></A><BR>Fires have the power on us to cast their beams
<A NAME="831"></A><BR>And blow their scorching exhalations forth
<A NAME="832"></A><BR>Against our members, those same distances
<A NAME="833"></A><BR>Take nothing by those intervals away
<A NAME="834"></A><BR>From bulk of flames; and to the sight the fire
<A NAME="835"></A><BR>Is nothing shrunken. Therefore, since the heat
<A NAME="836"></A><BR>And the outpoured light of skiey sun
<A NAME="837"></A><BR>Arrive our senses and caress our limbs,
<A NAME="838"></A><BR>Form too and bigness of the sun must look
<A NAME="839"></A><BR>Even here from earth just as they really be,
<A NAME="840"></A><BR>So that thou canst scarce nothing take or add.
<A NAME="841"></A><BR>And whether the journeying moon illuminate
<A NAME="842"></A><BR>The regions round with bastard beams, or throw
<A NAME="843"></A><BR>From off her proper body her own light,-
<A NAME="844"></A><BR>Whichever it be, she journeys with a form
<A NAME="845"></A><BR>Naught larger than the form doth seem to be
<A NAME="846"></A><BR>Which we with eyes of ours perceive. For all
<A NAME="847"></A><BR>The far removed objects of our gaze
<A NAME="848"></A><BR>Seem through much air confused in their look
<A NAME="849"></A><BR>Ere minished in their bigness. Wherefore, moon,
<A NAME="850"></A><BR>Since she presents bright look and clear-cut form,
<A NAME="851"></A><BR>May there on high by us on earth be seen
<A NAME="852"></A><BR>Just as she is with extreme bounds defined,
<A NAME="853"></A><BR>And just of the size. And lastly, whatso fires
<A NAME="854"></A><BR>Of ether thou from earth beholdest, these
<A NAME="855"></A><BR>Thou mayst consider as possibly of size
<A NAME="856"></A><BR>The least bit less, or larger by a hair
<A NAME="857"></A><BR>Than they appear- since whatso fires we view
<A NAME="858"></A><BR>Here in the lands of earth are seen to change
<A NAME="859"></A><BR>From time to time their size to less or more
<A NAME="860"></A><BR>Only the least, when more or less away,
<A NAME="861"></A><BR>So long as still they bicker clear, and still
<A NAME="862"></A><BR>Their glow's perceived.
<A NAME="863"></A><BR>Nor need there be for men
<A NAME="864"></A><BR>Astonishment that yonder sun so small
<A NAME="865"></A><BR>Can yet send forth so great a light as fills
<A NAME="866"></A><BR>Oceans and all the lands and sky aflood,
<A NAME="867"></A><BR>And with its fiery exhalations steeps
<A NAME="868"></A><BR>The world at large. For it may be, indeed,
<A NAME="869"></A><BR>That one vast-flowing well-spring of the whole
<A NAME="870"></A><BR>Wide world from here hath opened and out-gushed,
<A NAME="871"></A><BR>And shot its light abroad; because thuswise
<A NAME="872"></A><BR>The elements of fiery exhalations
<A NAME="873"></A><BR>From all the world around together come,
<A NAME="874"></A><BR>And thuswise flow into a bulk so big
<A NAME="875"></A><BR>That from one single fountain-head may stream
<A NAME="876"></A><BR>This heat and light. And seest thou not, indeed,
<A NAME="877"></A><BR>How widely one small water-spring may wet
<A NAME="878"></A><BR>The meadow-lands at times and flood the fields?
<A NAME="879"></A><BR>'Tis even possible, besides, that heat
<A NAME="880"></A><BR>From forth the sun's own fire, albeit that fire
<A NAME="881"></A><BR>Be not a great, may permeate the air
<A NAME="882"></A><BR>With the fierce hot- if but, perchance, the air
<A NAME="883"></A><BR>Be of condition and so tempered then
<A NAME="884"></A><BR>As to be kindled, even when beat upon
<A NAME="885"></A><BR>Only by little particles of heat-
<A NAME="886"></A><BR>Just as we sometimes see the standing grain
<A NAME="887"></A><BR>Or stubble straw in conflagration all
<A NAME="888"></A><BR>From one lone spark. And possibly the sun,
<A NAME="889"></A><BR>Agleam on high with rosy lampion,
<A NAME="890"></A><BR>Possesses about him with invisible heats
<A NAME="891"></A><BR>A plenteous fire, by no effulgence marked,
<A NAME="892"></A><BR>So that he maketh, he, the Fraught-with-fire,
<A NAME="893"></A><BR>Increase to such degree the force of rays.
<A NAME="894"></A><BR><BR>Nor is there one sure cause revealed to men
<A NAME="895"></A><BR>How the sun journeys from his summer haunts
<A NAME="896"></A><BR>On to the mid-most winter turning-points
<A NAME="897"></A><BR>In Capricorn, the thence reverting veers
<A NAME="898"></A><BR>Back to solstitial goals of Cancer; nor
<A NAME="899"></A><BR>How 'tis the moon is seen each month to cross
<A NAME="900"></A><BR>That very distance which in traversing
<A NAME="901"></A><BR>The sun consumes the measure of a year.
<A NAME="902"></A><BR>I say, no one clear reason hath been given
<A NAME="903"></A><BR>For these affairs. Yet chief in likelihood
<A NAME="904"></A><BR>Seemeth the doctrine which the holy thought
<A NAME="905"></A><BR>Of great Democritus lays down: that ever
<A NAME="906"></A><BR>The nearer the constellations be to earth
<A NAME="907"></A><BR>The less can they by whirling of the sky
<A NAME="908"></A><BR>Be borne along, because those skiey powers
<A NAME="909"></A><BR>Of speed aloft do vanish and decrease
<A NAME="910"></A><BR>In under-regions, and the sun is thus
<A NAME="911"></A><BR>Left by degrees behind amongst those signs
<A NAME="912"></A><BR>That follow after, since the sun he lies
<A NAME="913"></A><BR>Far down below the starry signs that blaze;
<A NAME="914"></A><BR>And the moon lags even tardier than the sun:
<A NAME="915"></A><BR>In just so far as is her course removed
<A NAME="916"></A><BR>From upper heaven and nigh unto the lands,
<A NAME="917"></A><BR>In just so far she fails to keep the pace
<A NAME="918"></A><BR>With starry signs above; for just so far
<A NAME="919"></A><BR>As feebler is the whirl that bears her on,
<A NAME="920"></A><BR>(Being, indeed, still lower than the sun),
<A NAME="921"></A><BR>In just so far do all the starry signs,
<A NAME="922"></A><BR>Circling around, o'ertake her and o'erpass.
<A NAME="923"></A><BR>Therefore it happens that the moon appears
<A NAME="924"></A><BR>More swiftly to return to any sign
<A NAME="925"></A><BR>Along the Zodiac, than doth the sun,
<A NAME="926"></A><BR>Because those signs do visit her again
<A NAME="927"></A><BR>More swiftly than they visit the great sun.
<A NAME="928"></A><BR>It can be also that two streams of air
<A NAME="929"></A><BR>Alternately at fixed periods
<A NAME="930"></A><BR>Blow out from transverse regions of the world,
<A NAME="931"></A><BR>Of which the one may thrust the sun away
<A NAME="932"></A><BR>From summer-signs to mid-most winter goals
<A NAME="933"></A><BR>And rigors of the cold, and the other then
<A NAME="934"></A><BR>May cast him back from icy shades of chill
<A NAME="935"></A><BR>Even to the heat-fraught regions and the signs
<A NAME="936"></A><BR>That blaze along the Zodiac. So, too,
<A NAME="937"></A><BR>We must suppose the moon and all the stars,
<A NAME="938"></A><BR>Which through the mighty and sidereal years
<A NAME="939"></A><BR>Roll round in mighty orbits, may be sped
<A NAME="940"></A><BR>By streams of air from regions alternate.
<A NAME="941"></A><BR>Seest thou not also how the clouds be sped
<A NAME="942"></A><BR>By contrary winds to regions contrary,
<A NAME="943"></A><BR>The lower clouds diversely from the upper?
<A NAME="944"></A><BR>Then, why may yonder stars in ether there
<A NAME="945"></A><BR>Along their mighty orbits not be borne
<A NAME="946"></A><BR>By currents opposite the one to other?
<A NAME="947"></A><BR><BR>But night o'erwhelms the lands with vasty murk
<A NAME="948"></A><BR>Either when sun, after his diurnal course,
<A NAME="949"></A><BR>Hath walked the ultimate regions of the sky
<A NAME="950"></A><BR>And wearily hath panted forth his fires,
<A NAME="951"></A><BR>Shivered by their long journeying and wasted
<A NAME="952"></A><BR>By traversing the multitudinous air,
<A NAME="953"></A><BR>Or else because the self-same force that drave
<A NAME="954"></A><BR>His orb along above the lands compels
<A NAME="955"></A><BR>Him then to turn his course beneath the lands.
<A NAME="956"></A><BR>Matuta also at a fixed hour
<A NAME="957"></A><BR>Spreadeth the roseate morning out along
<A NAME="958"></A><BR>The coasts of heaven and deploys the light,
<A NAME="959"></A><BR>Either because the self-same sun, returning
<A NAME="960"></A><BR>Under the lands, aspires to seize the sky,
<A NAME="961"></A><BR>Striving to set it blazing with his rays
<A NAME="962"></A><BR>Ere he himself appear, or else because
<A NAME="963"></A><BR>Fires then will congregate and many seeds
<A NAME="964"></A><BR>Of heat are wont, even at a fixed time,
<A NAME="965"></A><BR>To stream together- gendering evermore
<A NAME="966"></A><BR>New suns and light. Just so the story goes
<A NAME="967"></A><BR>That from the Idaean mountain-tops are seen
<A NAME="968"></A><BR>Dispersed fires upon the break of day
<A NAME="969"></A><BR>Which thence combine, as 'twere, into one ball
<A NAME="970"></A><BR>And form an orb. Nor yet in these affairs
<A NAME="971"></A><BR>Is aught for wonder that these seeds of fire
<A NAME="972"></A><BR>Can thus together stream at time so fixed
<A NAME="973"></A><BR>And shape anew the splendour of the sun.
<A NAME="974"></A><BR>For many facts we see which come to pass
<A NAME="975"></A><BR>At fixed time in all things: burgeon shrubs
<A NAME="976"></A><BR>At fixed time, and at a fixed time
<A NAME="977"></A><BR>They cast their flowers; and Eld commands the teeth,
<A NAME="978"></A><BR>At time as surely fixed, to drop away,
<A NAME="979"></A><BR>And Youth commands the growing boy to bloom
<A NAME="980"></A><BR>With the soft down and let from both his cheeks
<A NAME="981"></A><BR>The soft beard fall. And lastly, thunder-bolts,
<A NAME="982"></A><BR>Snow, rains, clouds, winds, at seasons of the year
<A NAME="983"></A><BR>Nowise unfixed, all do come to pass.
<A NAME="984"></A><BR>For where, even from their old primordial start
<A NAME="985"></A><BR>Causes have ever worked in such a way,
<A NAME="986"></A><BR>And where, even from the world's first origin,
<A NAME="987"></A><BR>Thuswise have things befallen, so even now
<A NAME="988"></A><BR>After a fixed order they come round
<A NAME="989"></A><BR>In sequence also.
<A NAME="990"></A><BR>Likewise, days may wax
<A NAME="991"></A><BR>Whilst the nights wane, and daylight minished be
<A NAME="992"></A><BR>Whilst nights do take their augmentations,
<A NAME="993"></A><BR>Either because the self-same sun, coursing
<A NAME="994"></A><BR>Under the lands and over in two arcs,
<A NAME="995"></A><BR>A longer and a briefer, doth dispart
<A NAME="996"></A><BR>The coasts of ether and divides in twain
<A NAME="997"></A><BR>His orbit all unequally, and adds,
<A NAME="998"></A><BR>As round he's borne, unto the one half there
<A NAME="999"></A><BR>As much as from the other half he's ta'en,
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR>Until he then arrives that sign of heaven
<A NAME="1001"></A><BR>Where the year's node renders the shades of night
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR>Equal unto the periods of light.
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR>For when the sun is midway on his course
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR>Between the blasts of north wind and of south,
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR>Heaven keeps his two goals parted equally,
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR>By virtue of the fixed position old
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR>Of the whole starry Zodiac, through which
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR>That sun, in winding onward, takes a year,
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR>Illumining the sky and all the lands
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR>With oblique light- as men declare to us
<A NAME="1011"></A><BR>Who by their diagrams have charted well
<A NAME="1012"></A><BR>Those regions of the sky which be adorned
<A NAME="1013"></A><BR>With the arranged signs of Zodiac.
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR>Or else, because in certain parts the air
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR>Under the lands is denser, the tremulous
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR>Bright beams of fire do waver tardily,
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR>Nor easily can penetrate that air
<A NAME="1018"></A><BR>Nor yet emerge unto their rising-place:
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR>For this it is that nights in winter time
<A NAME="1020"></A><BR>Do linger long, ere comes the many-rayed
<A NAME="1021"></A><BR>Round Badge of the day. Or else because, as said,
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR>In alternating seasons of the year
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR>Fires, now more quick, and now more slow, are wont
<A NAME="1024"></A><BR>To stream together- the fires which make the sun
<A NAME="1025"></A><BR>To rise in some one spot- therefore it is
<A NAME="1026"></A><BR>That those men seem to speak the truth who hold
<A NAME="1027"></A><BR>A new sun is with each new daybreak born.
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR><BR>The moon she possibly doth shine because
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR>Strook by the rays of sun, and day by day
<A NAME="1030"></A><BR>May turn unto our gaze her light, the more
<A NAME="1031"></A><BR>She doth recede from orb of sun, until,
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR>Facing him opposite across the world,
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR>She hath with full effulgence gleamed abroad,
<A NAME="1034"></A><BR>And, at her rising as she soars above,
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR>Hath there observed his setting; thence likewise
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR>She needs must hide, as 'twere, her light behind
<A NAME="1037"></A><BR>By slow degrees, the nearer now she glides,
<A NAME="1038"></A><BR>Along the circle of the Zodiac,
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR>From her far place toward fires of yonder sun-
<A NAME="1040"></A><BR>As those men hold who feign the moon to be
<A NAME="1041"></A><BR>Just like a ball and to pursue a course
<A NAME="1042"></A><BR>Betwixt the sun and earth. There is, again,
<A NAME="1043"></A><BR>Some reason to suppose that moon may roll
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR>With light her very own, and thus display
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR>The varied shapes of her resplendence there.
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR>For near her is, percase, another body,
<A NAME="1047"></A><BR>Invisible, because devoid of light,
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR>Borne on and gliding all along with her,
<A NAME="1049"></A><BR>Which in three modes may block and blot her disk.
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR>Again, she may revolve upon herself,
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR>Like to a ball's sphere- if perchance that be-
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR>One half of her dyed o'er with glowing light,
<A NAME="1053"></A><BR>And by the revolution of that sphere
<A NAME="1054"></A><BR>She may beget for us her varying shapes,
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR>Until she turns that fiery part of her
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR>Full to the sight and open eyes of men;
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR>Thence by slow stages round and back she whirls,
<A NAME="1058"></A><BR>Withdrawing thus the luminiferous part
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR>Of her sphered mass and ball, as, verily,
<A NAME="1060"></A><BR>The Babylonian doctrine of Chaldees,
<A NAME="1061"></A><BR>Refuting the art of Greek astrologers,
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR>Labours, in opposition, to prove sure-
<A NAME="1063"></A><BR>As if, forsooth, the thing for which each fights,
<A NAME="1064"></A><BR>Might not alike be true- or aught there were
<A NAME="1065"></A><BR>Wherefore thou mightest risk embracing one
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR>More than the other notion. Then, again,
<A NAME="1067"></A><BR>Why a new moon might not forevermore
<A NAME="1068"></A><BR>Created be with fixed successions there
<A NAME="1069"></A><BR>Of shapes and with configurations fixed,
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR>And why each day that bright created moon
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR>Might not miscarry and another be,
<A NAME="1072"></A><BR>In its stead and place, engendered anew,
<A NAME="1073"></A><BR>'Tis hard to show by reason, or by words
<A NAME="1074"></A><BR>To prove absurd- since, lo, so many things
<A NAME="1075"></A><BR>Can be create with fixed successions:
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR>Spring-time and Venus come, and Venus' boy,
<A NAME="1077"></A><BR>The winged harbinger, steps on before,
<A NAME="1078"></A><BR>And hard on Zephyr's foot-prints Mother Flora,
<A NAME="1079"></A><BR>Sprinkling the ways before them, filleth all
<A NAME="1080"></A><BR>With colours and with odours excellent;
<A NAME="1081"></A><BR>Whereafter follows arid Heat, and he
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR>Companioned is by Ceres, dusty one,
<A NAME="1083"></A><BR>And by the Etesian Breezes of the north
<A NAME="1084"></A><BR>At rising of the dog-star of the year;
<A NAME="1085"></A><BR>Then cometh Autumn on, and with him steps
<A NAME="1086"></A><BR>Lord Bacchus, and then other Seasons too
<A NAME="1087"></A><BR>And other Winds do follow- the high roar
<A NAME="1088"></A><BR>Of great Volturnus, and the Southwind strong
<A NAME="1089"></A><BR>With thunder-bolts. At last earth's Shortest-Day
<A NAME="1090"></A><BR>Bears on to men the snows and brings again
<A NAME="1091"></A><BR>The numbing cold. And Winter follows her,
<A NAME="1092"></A><BR>His teeth with chills a-chatter. Therefore, 'tis
<A NAME="1093"></A><BR>The less a marvel, if at fixed time
<A NAME="1094"></A><BR>A moon is thus begotten and again
<A NAME="1095"></A><BR>At fixed time destroyed, since things so many
<A NAME="1096"></A><BR>Can come to being thus at fixed time.
<A NAME="1097"></A><BR><BR>Likewise, the sun's eclipses and the moon's
<A NAME="1098"></A><BR>Far occultations rightly thou mayst deem
<A NAME="1099"></A><BR>As due to several causes. For, indeed,
<A NAME="1100"></A><BR>Why should the moon be able to shut out
<A NAME="1101"></A><BR>Earth from the light of sun, and on the side
<A NAME="1102"></A><BR>To earthward thrust her high head under sun,
<A NAME="1103"></A><BR>Opposing dark orb to his glowing beams-
<A NAME="1104"></A><BR>And yet, at same time, one suppose the effect
<A NAME="1105"></A><BR>Could not result from some one other body
<A NAME="1106"></A><BR>Which glides devoid of light forevermore?
<A NAME="1107"></A><BR>Again, why could not sun, in weakened state,
<A NAME="1108"></A><BR>At fixed time for-lose his fires, and then,
<A NAME="1109"></A><BR>When he has passed on along the air
<A NAME="1110"></A><BR>Beyond the regions, hostile to his flames,
<A NAME="1111"></A><BR>That quench and kill his fires, why could not he
<A NAME="1112"></A><BR>Renew his light? And why should earth in turn
<A NAME="1113"></A><BR>Have power to rob the moon of light, and there,
<A NAME="1114"></A><BR>Herself on high, keep the sun hid beneath,
<A NAME="1115"></A><BR>Whilst the moon glideth in her monthly course
<A NAME="1116"></A><BR>Athrough the rigid shadows of the cone?-
<A NAME="1117"></A><BR>And yet, at same time, some one other body
<A NAME="1118"></A><BR>Not have the power to under-pass the moon,
<A NAME="1119"></A><BR>Or glide along above the orb of sun,
<A NAME="1120"></A><BR>Breaking his rays and outspread light asunder?
<A NAME="1121"></A><BR>And still, if moon herself refulgent be
<A NAME="1122"></A><BR>With her own sheen, why could she not at times
<A NAME="1123"></A><BR>In some one quarter of the mighty world
<A NAME="1124"></A><BR>Grow weak and weary, whilst she passeth through
<A NAME="1125"></A><BR>Regions unfriendly to the beams her own?
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1126"></A><B>Origins of Vegetable and Animal Life</B>

<A NAME="1127"></A><BR><BR>And now to what remains!- Since I've resolved
<A NAME="1128"></A><BR>By what arrangements all things come to pass
<A NAME="1129"></A><BR>Through the blue regions of the mighty world,-
<A NAME="1130"></A><BR>How we can know what energy and cause
<A NAME="1131"></A><BR>Started the various courses of the sun
<A NAME="1132"></A><BR>And the moon's goings, and by what far means
<A NAME="1133"></A><BR>They can succumb, the while with thwarted light,
<A NAME="1134"></A><BR>And veil with shade the unsuspecting lands,
<A NAME="1135"></A><BR>When, as it were, they blink, and then again
<A NAME="1136"></A><BR>With open eye survey all regions wide,
<A NAME="1137"></A><BR>Resplendent with white radiance- I do now
<A NAME="1138"></A><BR>Return unto the world's primeval age
<A NAME="1139"></A><BR>And tell what first the soft young fields of earth
<A NAME="1140"></A><BR>With earliest parturition had decreed
<A NAME="1141"></A><BR>To raise in air unto the shores of light
<A NAME="1142"></A><BR>And to entrust unto the wayward winds.
<A NAME="1143"></A><BR><BR>In the beginning, earth gave forth, around
<A NAME="1144"></A><BR>The hills and over all the length of plains,
<A NAME="1145"></A><BR>The race of grasses and the shining green;
<A NAME="1146"></A><BR>The flowery meadows sparkled all aglow
<A NAME="1147"></A><BR>With greening colour, and thereafter, lo,
<A NAME="1148"></A><BR>Unto the divers kinds of trees was given
<A NAME="1149"></A><BR>An emulous impulse mightily to shoot,
<A NAME="1150"></A><BR>With a free rein, aloft into the air.
<A NAME="1151"></A><BR>As feathers and hairs and bristles are begot
<A NAME="1152"></A><BR>The first on members of the four-foot breeds
<A NAME="1153"></A><BR>And on the bodies of the strong-y-winged,
<A NAME="1154"></A><BR>Thus then the new Earth first of all put forth
<A NAME="1155"></A><BR>Grasses and shrubs, and afterward begat
<A NAME="1156"></A><BR>The mortal generations, there upsprung-
<A NAME="1157"></A><BR>Innumerable in modes innumerable-
<A NAME="1158"></A><BR>After diverging fashions. For from sky
<A NAME="1159"></A><BR>These breathing-creatures never can have dropped,
<A NAME="1160"></A><BR>Nor the land-dwellers ever have come up
<A NAME="1161"></A><BR>Out of sea-pools of salt. How true remains,
<A NAME="1162"></A><BR>How merited is that adopted name
<A NAME="1163"></A><BR>Of earth- "The Mother!"- since from out the earth
<A NAME="1164"></A><BR>Are all begotten. And even now arise
<A NAME="1165"></A><BR>From out the loams how many living things-
<A NAME="1166"></A><BR>Concreted by the rains and heat of the sun.
<A NAME="1167"></A><BR>Wherefore 'tis less a marvel, if they sprang
<A NAME="1168"></A><BR>In Long Ago more many, and more big,
<A NAME="1169"></A><BR>Matured of those days in the fresh young years
<A NAME="1170"></A><BR>Of earth and ether. First of all, the race
<A NAME="1171"></A><BR>Of the winged ones and parti-coloured birds,
<A NAME="1172"></A><BR>Hatched out in spring-time, left their eggs behind;
<A NAME="1173"></A><BR>As now-a-days in summer tree-crickets
<A NAME="1174"></A><BR>Do leave their shiny husks of own accord,
<A NAME="1175"></A><BR>Seeking their food and living. Then it was
<A NAME="1176"></A><BR>This earth of thine first gave unto the day
<A NAME="1177"></A><BR>The mortal generations; for prevailed
<A NAME="1178"></A><BR>Among the fields abounding hot and wet.
<A NAME="1179"></A><BR>And hence, where any fitting spot was given,
<A NAME="1180"></A><BR>There 'gan to grow womb-cavities, by roots
<A NAME="1181"></A><BR>Affixed to earth. And when in ripened time
<A NAME="1182"></A><BR>The age of the young within (that sought the air
<A NAME="1183"></A><BR>And fled earth's damps) had burst these wombs, O 
<A NAME="1184"></A>then
<A NAME="1185"></A><BR>Would Nature thither turn the pores of earth
<A NAME="1186"></A><BR>And make her spurt from open veins a juice
<A NAME="1187"></A><BR>Like unto milk; even as a woman now
<A NAME="1188"></A><BR>Is filled, at child-bearing, with the sweet milk,
<A NAME="1189"></A><BR>Because all that swift stream of aliment
<A NAME="1190"></A><BR>Is thither turned unto the mother-breasts.
<A NAME="1191"></A><BR>There earth would furnish to the children food;
<A NAME="1192"></A><BR>Warmth was their swaddling cloth, the grass their 
<A NAME="1193"></A>bed
<A NAME="1194"></A><BR>Abounding in soft down. Earth's newness then
<A NAME="1195"></A><BR>Would rouse no dour spells of the bitter cold,
<A NAME="1196"></A><BR>Nor extreme heats nor winds of mighty powers-
<A NAME="1197"></A><BR>For all things grow and gather strength through 
<A NAME="1198"></A>time
<A NAME="1199"></A><BR>In like proportions; and then earth was young.
<A NAME="1200"></A><BR><BR>Wherefore, again, again, how merited
<A NAME="1201"></A><BR>Is that adopted name of Earth- The Mother!-
<A NAME="1202"></A><BR>Since she herself begat the human race,
<A NAME="1203"></A><BR>And at one well-nigh fixed time brought forth
<A NAME="1204"></A><BR>Each breast that ranges raving round about
<A NAME="1205"></A><BR>Upon the mighty mountains and all birds
<A NAME="1206"></A><BR>Aerial with many a varied shape.
<A NAME="1207"></A><BR>But, lo, because her bearing years must end,
<A NAME="1208"></A><BR>She ceased, like to a woman worn by eld.
<A NAME="1209"></A><BR>For lapsing aeons change the nature of
<A NAME="1210"></A><BR>The whole wide world, and all things needs must 
<A NAME="1211"></A>take
<A NAME="1212"></A><BR>One status after other, nor aught persists
<A NAME="1213"></A><BR>Forever like itself. All things depart;
<A NAME="1214"></A><BR>Nature she changeth all, compelleth all
<A NAME="1215"></A><BR>To transformation. Lo, this moulders down,
<A NAME="1216"></A><BR>A-slack with weary eld, and that, again,
<A NAME="1217"></A><BR>Prospers in glory, issuing from contempt.
<A NAME="1218"></A><BR>In suchwise, then, the lapsing aeons change
<A NAME="1219"></A><BR>The nature of the whole wide world, and earth
<A NAME="1220"></A><BR>Taketh one status after other. And what
<A NAME="1221"></A><BR>She bore of old, she now can bear no longer,
<A NAME="1222"></A><BR>And what she never bore, she can to-day.
<A NAME="1223"></A><BR><BR>In those days also the telluric world
<A NAME="1224"></A><BR>Strove to beget the monsters that upsprung
<A NAME="1225"></A><BR>With their astounding visages and limbs-
<A NAME="1226"></A><BR>The Man-woman- a thing betwixt the twain,
<A NAME="1227"></A><BR>Yet neither, and from either sex remote-
<A NAME="1228"></A><BR>Some gruesome Boggles orphaned of the feet,
<A NAME="1229"></A><BR>Some widowed of the hands, dumb Horrors too
<A NAME="1230"></A><BR>Without a mouth, or blind Ones of no eye,
<A NAME="1231"></A><BR>Or Bulks all shackled by their legs and arms
<A NAME="1232"></A><BR>Cleaving unto the body fore and aft,
<A NAME="1233"></A><BR>Thuswise, that never could they do or go,
<A NAME="1234"></A><BR>Nor shun disaster, nor take the good they would.
<A NAME="1235"></A><BR>And other prodigies and monsters earth
<A NAME="1236"></A><BR>Was then begetting of this sort- in vain,
<A NAME="1237"></A><BR>Since Nature banned with horror their increase,
<A NAME="1238"></A><BR>And powerless were they to reach unto
<A NAME="1239"></A><BR>The coveted flower of fair maturity,
<A NAME="1240"></A><BR>Or to find aliment, or to intertwine
<A NAME="1241"></A><BR>In works of Venus. For we see there must
<A NAME="1242"></A><BR>Concur in life conditions manifold,
<A NAME="1243"></A><BR>If life is ever by begetting life
<A NAME="1244"></A><BR>To forge the generations one by one:
<A NAME="1245"></A><BR>First, foods must be; and, next, a path whereby
<A NAME="1246"></A><BR>The seeds of impregnation in the frame
<A NAME="1247"></A><BR>May ooze, released from the members all;
<A NAME="1248"></A><BR>Last, the possession of those instruments
<A NAME="1249"></A><BR>Whereby the male with female can unite,
<A NAME="1250"></A><BR>The one with other in mutual ravishments.
<A NAME="1251"></A><BR><BR>And in the ages after monsters died,
<A NAME="1252"></A><BR>Perforce there perished many a stock, unable
<A NAME="1253"></A><BR>By propagation to forge a progeny.
<A NAME="1254"></A><BR>For whatsoever creatures thou beholdest
<A NAME="1255"></A><BR>Breathing the breath of life, the same have been
<A NAME="1256"></A><BR>Even from their earliest age preserved alive
<A NAME="1257"></A><BR>By cunning, or by valour, or at least
<A NAME="1258"></A><BR>By speed of foot or wing. And many a stock
<A NAME="1259"></A><BR>Remaineth yet, because of use to man,
<A NAME="1260"></A><BR>And so committed to man's guardianship.
<A NAME="1261"></A><BR>Valour hath saved alive fierce lion-breeds
<A NAME="1262"></A><BR>And many another terrorizing race,
<A NAME="1263"></A><BR>Cunning the foxes, flight the antlered stags.
<A NAME="1264"></A><BR>Light-sleeping dogs with faithful heart in breast,
<A NAME="1265"></A><BR>However, and every kind begot from seed
<A NAME="1266"></A><BR>Of beasts of draft, as, too, the woolly flocks
<A NAME="1267"></A><BR>And horned cattle, all, my Memmius,
<A NAME="1268"></A><BR>Have been committed to guardianship of men.
<A NAME="1269"></A><BR>For anxiously they fled the savage beasts,
<A NAME="1270"></A><BR>And peace they sought and their abundant foods,
<A NAME="1271"></A><BR>Obtained with never labours of their own,
<A NAME="1272"></A><BR>Which we secure to them as fit rewards
<A NAME="1273"></A><BR>For their good service. But those beasts to whom
<A NAME="1274"></A><BR>Nature has granted naught of these same things-
<A NAME="1275"></A><BR>Beasts quite unfit by own free will to thrive
<A NAME="1276"></A><BR>And vain for any service unto us
<A NAME="1277"></A><BR>In thanks for which we should permit their kind
<A NAME="1278"></A><BR>To feed and be in our protection safe-
<A NAME="1279"></A><BR>Those, of a truth, were wont to be exposed,
<A NAME="1280"></A><BR>Enshackled in the gruesome bonds of doom,
<A NAME="1281"></A><BR>As prey and booty for the rest, until
<A NAME="1282"></A><BR>Nature reduced that stock to utter death.
<A NAME="1283"></A><BR><BR>But Centaurs ne'er have been, nor can there 
<A NAME="1284"></A>be
<A NAME="1285"></A><BR>Creatures of twofold stock and double frame,
<A NAME="1286"></A><BR>Compact of members alien in kind,
<A NAME="1287"></A><BR>Yet formed with equal function, equal force
<A NAME="1288"></A><BR>In every bodily part- a fact thou mayst,
<A NAME="1289"></A><BR>However dull thy wits, well learn from this:
<A NAME="1290"></A><BR>The horse, when his three years have rolled away,
<A NAME="1291"></A><BR>Flowers in his prime of vigour; but the boy
<A NAME="1292"></A><BR>Not so, for oft even then he gropes in sleep
<A NAME="1293"></A><BR>After the milky nipples of the breasts,
<A NAME="1294"></A><BR>An infant still. And later, when at last
<A NAME="1295"></A><BR>The lusty powers of horses and stout limbs,
<A NAME="1296"></A><BR>Now weak through lapsing life, do fail with age,
<A NAME="1297"></A><BR>Lo, only then doth youth with flowering years
<A NAME="1298"></A><BR>Begin for boys, and clothe their ruddy cheeks
<A NAME="1299"></A><BR>With the soft down. So never deem, percase,
<A NAME="1300"></A><BR>That from a man and from the seed of horse,
<A NAME="1301"></A><BR>The beast of draft, can Centaurs be composed
<A NAME="1302"></A><BR>Or e'er exist alive, nor Scyllas be-
<A NAME="1303"></A><BR>The half-fish bodies girdled with mad dogs-
<A NAME="1304"></A><BR>Nor others of this sort, in whom we mark
<A NAME="1305"></A><BR>Members discordant each with each; for ne'er
<A NAME="1306"></A><BR>At one same time they reach their flower of age
<A NAME="1307"></A><BR>Or gain and lose full vigour of their frame,
<A NAME="1308"></A><BR>And never burn with one same lust of love,
<A NAME="1309"></A><BR>And never in their habits they agree,
<A NAME="1310"></A><BR>Nor find the same foods equally delightsome-
<A NAME="1311"></A><BR>Sooth, as one oft may see the bearded goats
<A NAME="1312"></A><BR>Batten upon the hemlock which to man
<A NAME="1313"></A><BR>Is violent poison. Once again, since flame
<A NAME="1314"></A><BR>Is wont to scorch and burn the tawny bulks
<A NAME="1315"></A><BR>Of the great lions as much as other kinds
<A NAME="1316"></A><BR>Of flesh and blood existing in the lands,
<A NAME="1317"></A><BR>How could it be that she, Chimaera lone,
<A NAME="1318"></A><BR>With triple body- fore, a lion she;
<A NAME="1319"></A><BR>And aft, a dragon; and betwixt, a goat-
<A NAME="1320"></A><BR>Might at the mouth from out the body belch
<A NAME="1321"></A><BR>Infuriate flame? Wherefore, the man who feigns
<A NAME="1322"></A><BR>Such beings could have been engendered
<A NAME="1323"></A><BR>When earth was new and the young sky was fresh
<A NAME="1324"></A><BR>(Basing his empty argument on new)
<A NAME="1325"></A><BR>May babble with like reason many whims
<A NAME="1326"></A><BR>Into our ears: he'll say, perhaps, that then
<A NAME="1327"></A><BR>Rivers of gold through every landscape flowed,
<A NAME="1328"></A><BR>That trees were wont with precious stones to flower,
<A NAME="1329"></A><BR>Or that in those far aeons man was born
<A NAME="1330"></A><BR>With such gigantic length and lift of limbs
<A NAME="1331"></A><BR>As to be able, based upon his feet,
<A NAME="1332"></A><BR>Deep oceans to bestride; or with his hands
<A NAME="1333"></A><BR>To whirl the firmament around his head.
<A NAME="1334"></A><BR>For though in earth were many seeds of things
<A NAME="1335"></A><BR>In the old time when this telluric world
<A NAME="1336"></A><BR>First poured the breeds of animals abroad,
<A NAME="1337"></A><BR>Still that is nothing of a sign that then
<A NAME="1338"></A><BR>Such hybrid creatures could have been begot
<A NAME="1339"></A><BR>And limbs of all beasts heterogeneous
<A NAME="1340"></A><BR>Have been together knit; because, indeed,
<A NAME="1341"></A><BR>The divers kinds of grasses and the grains
<A NAME="1342"></A><BR>And the delightsome trees- which even now
<A NAME="1343"></A><BR>Spring up abounding from within the earth-
<A NAME="1344"></A><BR>Can still ne'er be begotten with their stems
<A NAME="1345"></A><BR>Begrafted into one; but each sole thing
<A NAME="1346"></A><BR>Proceeds according to its proper wont
<A NAME="1347"></A><BR>And all conserve their own distinctions based
<A NAME="1348"></A><BR>In Nature's fixed decree.

<A NAME="1349"></A><B>Origins and Savage Period of Mankind</B>

<A NAME="1350"></A><BR><BR>But mortal man
<A NAME="1351"></A><BR>Was then far hardier in the old champaign,
<A NAME="1352"></A><BR>As well he should be, since a hardier earth
<A NAME="1353"></A><BR>Had him begotten; builded too was he
<A NAME="1354"></A><BR>Of bigger and more solid bones within,
<A NAME="1355"></A><BR>And knit with stalwart sinews through the flesh,
<A NAME="1356"></A><BR>Nor easily seized by either heat or cold,
<A NAME="1357"></A><BR>Or alien food or any ail or irk.
<A NAME="1358"></A><BR>And whilst so many lustrums of the sun
<A NAME="1359"></A><BR>Rolled on across the sky, men led a life
<A NAME="1360"></A><BR>After the roving habit of wild beasts.
<A NAME="1361"></A><BR>Not then were sturdy guiders of curved ploughs,
<A NAME="1362"></A><BR>And none knew then to work the fields with iron,
<A NAME="1363"></A><BR>Or plant young shoots in holes of delved loam,
<A NAME="1364"></A><BR>Or lop with hooked knives from off high trees
<A NAME="1365"></A><BR>The boughs of yester-year. What sun and rains
<A NAME="1366"></A><BR>To them had given, what earth of own accord
<A NAME="1367"></A><BR>Created then, was boon enough to glad
<A NAME="1368"></A><BR>Their simple hearts. Mid acorn-laden oaks
<A NAME="1369"></A><BR>Would they refresh their bodies for the nonce;
<A NAME="1370"></A><BR>And the wild berries of the arbute-tree,
<A NAME="1371"></A><BR>Which now thou seest to ripen purple-red
<A NAME="1372"></A><BR>In winter time, the old telluric soil
<A NAME="1373"></A><BR>Would bear then more abundant and more big.
<A NAME="1374"></A><BR>And many coarse foods, too, in long ago
<A NAME="1375"></A><BR>The blooming freshness of the rank young world
<A NAME="1376"></A><BR>Produced, enough for those poor wretches there.
<A NAME="1377"></A><BR>And rivers and springs would summon them of old
<A NAME="1378"></A><BR>To slake the thirst, as now from the great hills
<A NAME="1379"></A><BR>The water's down-rush calls aloud and far
<A NAME="1380"></A><BR>The thirsty generations of the wild.
<A NAME="1381"></A><BR>So, too, they sought the grottos of the Nymphs-
<A NAME="1382"></A><BR>The woodland haunts discovered as they ranged-
<A NAME="1383"></A><BR>From forth of which they knew that gliding rills
<A NAME="1384"></A><BR>With gush and splash abounding laved the rocks,
<A NAME="1385"></A><BR>The dripping rocks, and trickled from above
<A NAME="1386"></A><BR>Over the verdant moss; and here and there
<A NAME="1387"></A><BR>Welled up and burst across the open flats.
<A NAME="1388"></A><BR>As yet they knew not to enkindle fire
<A NAME="1389"></A><BR>Against the cold, nor hairy pelts to use
<A NAME="1390"></A><BR>And clothe their bodies with the spoils of beasts;
<A NAME="1391"></A><BR>But huddled in groves, and mountain-caves, and woods,
<A NAME="1392"></A><BR>And 'mongst the thickets hid their squalid backs,
<A NAME="1393"></A><BR>When driven to flee the lashings of the winds
<A NAME="1394"></A><BR>And the big rains. Nor could they then regard
<A NAME="1395"></A><BR>The general good, nor did they know to use
<A NAME="1396"></A><BR>In common any customs, any laws:
<A NAME="1397"></A><BR>Whatever of booty fortune unto each
<A NAME="1398"></A><BR>Had proffered, each alone would bear away,
<A NAME="1399"></A><BR>By instinct trained for self to thrive and live.
<A NAME="1400"></A><BR>And Venus in the forests then would link
<A NAME="1401"></A><BR>The lovers' bodies; for the woman yielded
<A NAME="1402"></A><BR>Either from mutual flame, or from the man's
<A NAME="1403"></A><BR>Impetuous fury and insatiate lust,
<A NAME="1404"></A><BR>Or from a bribe- as acorn-nuts, choice pears,
<A NAME="1405"></A><BR>Or the wild berries of the arbute-tree.
<A NAME="1406"></A><BR>And trusting wondrous strength of hands and legs,
<A NAME="1407"></A><BR>They'd chase the forest-wanderers, the beasts;
<A NAME="1408"></A><BR>And many they'd conquer, but some few they fled,
<A NAME="1409"></A><BR>A-skulk into their hiding-places...
<A NAME="1410"></A><BR><BR>With the flung stones and with the ponderous 
<A NAME="1411"></A>heft
<A NAME="1412"></A><BR>Of gnarled branch. And by the time of night
<A NAME="1413"></A><BR>O'ertaken, they would throw, like bristly boars,
<A NAME="1414"></A><BR>Their wildman's limbs naked upon the earth,
<A NAME="1415"></A><BR>Rolling themselves in leaves and fronded boughs.
<A NAME="1416"></A><BR>Nor would they call with lamentations loud
<A NAME="1417"></A><BR>Around the fields for daylight and the sun,
<A NAME="1418"></A><BR>Quaking and wand'ring in shadows of the night;
<A NAME="1419"></A><BR>But, silent and buried in a sleep, they'd wait
<A NAME="1420"></A><BR>Until the sun with rosy flambeau brought
<A NAME="1421"></A><BR>The glory to the sky. From childhood wont
<A NAME="1422"></A><BR>Ever to see the dark and day begot
<A NAME="1423"></A><BR>In times alternate, never might they be
<A NAME="1424"></A><BR>Wildered by wild misgiving, lest a night
<A NAME="1425"></A><BR>Eternal should posses the lands, with light
<A NAME="1426"></A><BR>Of sun withdrawn forever. But their care
<A NAME="1427"></A><BR>Was rather that the clans of savage beasts
<A NAME="1428"></A><BR>Would often make their sleep-time horrible
<A NAME="1429"></A><BR>For those poor wretches; and, from home y-driven,
<A NAME="1430"></A><BR>They'd flee their rocky shelters at approach
<A NAME="1431"></A><BR>Of boar, the spumy-lipped, or lion strong,
<A NAME="1432"></A><BR>And in the midnight yield with terror up
<A NAME="1433"></A><BR>To those fierce guests their beds of out-spread 
<A NAME="1434"></A>leaves.
<A NAME="1435"></A><BR><BR>And yet in those days not much more than now
<A NAME="1436"></A><BR>Would generations of mortality
<A NAME="1437"></A><BR>Leave the sweet light of fading life behind.
<A NAME="1438"></A><BR>Indeed, in those days here and there a man,
<A NAME="1439"></A><BR>More oftener snatched upon, and gulped by fangs,
<A NAME="1440"></A><BR>Afforded the beasts a food that roared alive,
<A NAME="1441"></A><BR>Echoing through groves and hills and forest trees,
<A NAME="1442"></A><BR>Even as he viewed his living flesh entombed
<A NAME="1443"></A><BR>Within a living grave; whilst those whom flight
<A NAME="1444"></A><BR>Had saved, with bone and body bitten, shrieked,
<A NAME="1445"></A><BR>Pressing their quivering palms to loathsome sores,
<A NAME="1446"></A><BR>With horrible voices for eternal death-
<A NAME="1447"></A><BR>Until, forlorn of help, and witless what
<A NAME="1448"></A><BR>Might medicine their wounds, the writhing pangs
<A NAME="1449"></A><BR>Took them from life. But not in those far times
<A NAME="1450"></A><BR>Would one lone day give over unto doom
<A NAME="1451"></A><BR>A soldiery in thousands marching on
<A NAME="1452"></A><BR>Beneath the battle-banners, nor would then
<A NAME="1453"></A><BR>The ramping breakers of the main seas dash
<A NAME="1454"></A><BR>Whole argosies and crews upon the rocks.
<A NAME="1455"></A><BR>But ocean uprisen would often rave in vain,
<A NAME="1456"></A><BR>Without all end or outcome, and give up
<A NAME="1457"></A><BR>Its empty menacings as lightly too;
<A NAME="1458"></A><BR>Nor soft seductions of a serene sea
<A NAME="1459"></A><BR>Could lure by laughing billows any man
<A NAME="1460"></A><BR>Out to disaster: for the science bold
<A NAME="1461"></A><BR>Of ship-sailing lay dark in those far times.
<A NAME="1462"></A><BR>Again, 'twas then that lack of food gave o'er
<A NAME="1463"></A><BR>Men's fainting limbs to dissolution: now
<A NAME="1464"></A><BR>'Tis plenty overwhelms. Unwary, they
<A NAME="1465"></A><BR>Oft for themselves themselves would then outpour
<A NAME="1466"></A><BR>The poison; now, with nicer art, themselves
<A NAME="1467"></A><BR>They give the drafts to others.

<A NAME="1468"></A><B>Beginnings of Civilization</B>

<A NAME="1469"></A><BR><BR>Afterwards,
<A NAME="1470"></A><BR>When huts they had procured and pelts and fire,
<A NAME="1471"></A><BR>And when the woman, joined unto the man,
<A NAME="1472"></A><BR>Withdrew with him into one dwelling place,
<A NAME="1473"></A><BR><BR>Were known; and when they saw an offspring born
<A NAME="1474"></A><BR>From out themselves, then first the human race
<A NAME="1475"></A><BR>Began to soften. For 'twas now that fire
<A NAME="1476"></A><BR>Rendered their shivering frames less staunch to 
<A NAME="1477"></A>bear,
<A NAME="1478"></A><BR>Under the canopy of the sky, the cold;
<A NAME="1479"></A><BR>And Love reduced their shaggy hardiness;
<A NAME="1480"></A><BR>And children, with the prattle and the kiss,
<A NAME="1481"></A><BR>Soon broke the parents' haughty temper down.
<A NAME="1482"></A><BR>Then, too, did neighbours 'gin to league as friends,
<A NAME="1483"></A><BR>Eager to wrong no more or suffer wrong,
<A NAME="1484"></A><BR>And urged for children and the womankind
<A NAME="1485"></A><BR>Mercy, of fathers, whilst with cries and gestures
<A NAME="1486"></A><BR>They stammered hints how meet it was that all
<A NAME="1487"></A><BR>Should have compassion on the weak. And still,
<A NAME="1488"></A><BR>Though concord not in every wise could then
<A NAME="1489"></A><BR>Begotten be, a good, a goodly part
<A NAME="1490"></A><BR>Kept faith inviolate- or else mankind
<A NAME="1491"></A><BR>Long since had been unutterably cut off,
<A NAME="1492"></A><BR>And propagation never could have brought
<A NAME="1493"></A><BR>The species down the ages.
<A NAME="1494"></A><BR>Lest, perchance,
<A NAME="1495"></A><BR>Concerning these affairs thou ponderest
<A NAME="1496"></A><BR>In silent meditation, let me say
<A NAME="1497"></A><BR>'Twas lightning brought primevally to earth
<A NAME="1498"></A><BR>The fire for mortals, and from thence hath spread
<A NAME="1499"></A><BR>O'er all the lands the flames of heat. For thus
<A NAME="1500"></A><BR>Even now we see so many objects, touched
<A NAME="1501"></A><BR>By the celestial flames, to flash aglow,
<A NAME="1502"></A><BR>When thunderbolt has dowered them with heat.
<A NAME="1503"></A><BR>Yet also when a many-branched tree,
<A NAME="1504"></A><BR>Beaten by winds, writhes swaying to and fro,
<A NAME="1505"></A><BR>Pressing 'gainst branches of a neighbour tree,
<A NAME="1506"></A><BR>There by the power of mighty rub and rub
<A NAME="1507"></A><BR>Is fire engendered; and at times out-flares
<A NAME="1508"></A><BR>The scorching heat of flame, when boughs do chafe
<A NAME="1509"></A><BR>Against the trunks. And of these causes, either
<A NAME="1510"></A><BR>May well have given to mortal men the fire.
<A NAME="1511"></A><BR>Next, food to cook and soften in the flame
<A NAME="1512"></A><BR>The sun instructed, since so oft they saw
<A NAME="1513"></A><BR>How objects mellowed, when subdued by warmth
<A NAME="1514"></A><BR>And by the
