<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>1. Since feeling and voluntary motion are peculiar to animals, whilst growth 
<A NAME="11"></A>and nutrition are common to plants as well, we may look on the former as 
<A NAME="12"></A>effects of the soul and the latter as effects of the nature. And if there 
<A NAME="13"></A>be anyone who allows a share in soul to plants as well, and separates the 
<A NAME="14"></A>two kinds of soul, naming the kind in question vegetative, and the other 
<A NAME="15"></A>sensory, this person is not saying anything else, although his language 
<A NAME="16"></A>is somewhat unusual. We, however, for our part, are convinced that the 
<A NAME="17"></A>chief merit of language is clearness, and we know that nothing detracts 
<A NAME="18"></A>so much from this as do unfamiliar terms; accordingly we employ those terms 
<A NAME="19"></A>which the bulk of people are accustomed to use, and we say that animals 
<A NAME="20"></A>are governed at once by their soul and by their nature, and plants by their 
<A NAME="21"></A>nature alone, and that growth and nutrition are the effects of nature, 
<A NAME="22"></A>not of soul.
<A NAME="23"></A><BR><BR>2. Thus we shall enquire, in the course of this treatise, from 
<A NAME="24"></A>what faculties these effects themselves, as well as any other effects of 
<A NAME="25"></A>nature which there may be, take their origin.
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR>First, however, we must distinguish and explain clearly the various 
<A NAME="27"></A>terms which we are going to use in this treatise, and to what things we 
<A NAME="28"></A>apply them; and this will prove to be not merely an explanation of terms 
<A NAME="29"></A>but at the same time a demonstration of the effects of 
<A NAME="30"></A>nature.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR>When, therefore, such and such a body undergoes no change from 
<A NAME="32"></A>its existing state, we say that it is at rest; but, not withstanding, if 
<A NAME="33"></A>it departs from this in any respect we then say that in this respect it 
<A NAME="34"></A>undergoes motion. Accordingly, when it departs in various ways from its 
<A NAME="35"></A>preexisting state, it will be said to undergo various kinds of motion. 
<A NAME="36"></A>Thus, if that which is white becomes black, or what is black becomes white, 
<A NAME="37"></A>it undergoes motion in respect to colour; or if what was previously sweet 
<A NAME="38"></A>now becomes bitter, or, conversely, from being bitter now becomes sweet, 
<A NAME="39"></A>it will be said to undergo motion in respect to flavour; to both of these 
<A NAME="40"></A>instances, as well as to those previously mentioned, we shall apply the 
<A NAME="41"></A>term qualitative motion. And further, it is not only things which are altered 
<A NAME="42"></A>in regard to colour and flavour which, we say, undergo motion; when a warm 
<A NAME="43"></A>thing becomes cold, and a cold warm, here too we speak of its undergoing 
<A NAME="44"></A>motion; similarly also when anything moist becomes dry, or dry moist. Now, 
<A NAME="45"></A>the common term which we apply to all these cases is 
<A NAME="46"></A>alteration.
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR>This is one kind of motion. But there is another kind which occurs 
<A NAME="48"></A>in bodies which change their position, or as we say, pass from one place 
<A NAME="49"></A>to another; the name of this is transference.
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR>These two kinds of motion, then, are simple and primary, while 
<A NAME="51"></A>compounded from them we have growth and decay, as when a small thing becomes 
<A NAME="52"></A>bigger, or a big thing smaller, each retaining at the same time its particular 
<A NAME="53"></A>form. And two other kinds of motion are genesis and destruction, genesis 
<A NAME="54"></A>being a coming into existence, and destruction being the 
<A NAME="55"></A>opposite.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR>Now, common to all kinds of motion is change from the preexisting 
<A NAME="57"></A>state, while common to all conditions of rest is retention of the preexisting 
<A NAME="58"></A>state. The Sophists, however, while allowing that bread in turning into 
<A NAME="59"></A>blood becomes changed as regards sight, taste, and touch, will not agree 
<A NAME="60"></A>that this change occurs in reality. Thus some of them hold that all such 
<A NAME="61"></A>phenomena are tricks and illusions of our senses; the senses, they say, 
<A NAME="62"></A>are affected now in one way, now in another, whereas the underlying substance 
<A NAME="63"></A>does not admit of any of these changes to which the names are given. Others 
<A NAME="64"></A>(such as Anaxagoras) will have it that the qualities do exist in it, but 
<A NAME="65"></A>that they are unchangeable and immutable from eternity to eternity, and 
<A NAME="66"></A>that these apparent alterations are brought about by separation and 
<A NAME="67"></A>combination.
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR>Now, if I were to go out of my way to confute these people, my 
<A NAME="69"></A>subsidiary task would be greater than my main one. Thus, if they do not 
<A NAME="70"></A>know all that has been written, "On Complete Alteration of Substance" by 
<A NAME="71"></A>Aristotle, and after him by Chrysippus, I must beg of them to make themselves 
<A NAME="72"></A>familiar with these men's writings. If, however, they know these, and yet 
<A NAME="73"></A>willingly prefer the worse views to the better, they will doubtless consider 
<A NAME="74"></A>my arguments foolish also. I have shown elsewhere that these opinions were 
<A NAME="75"></A>shared by Hippocrates, who lived much earlier than Aristotle. In fact, 
<A NAME="76"></A>all those known to us who have been both physicians and philosophers Hippocrates 
<A NAME="77"></A>was the first who took in hand to demonstrate that there are, in all, four 
<A NAME="78"></A>mutually interacting qualities, and that to the operation of these is due 
<A NAME="79"></A>the genesis and destruction of all things that come into and pass out of 
<A NAME="80"></A>being. Nay, more; Hippocrates was also the first to recognise that all 
<A NAME="81"></A>these qualities undergo an intimate mingling with one another; and at least 
<A NAME="82"></A>the beginnings of the proofs to which Aristotle later set his hand are 
<A NAME="83"></A>to be found first in the writings of Hippocrates.
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><BR>As to whether we are to suppose that the substances as well as 
<A NAME="85"></A>their qualities undergo this intimate mingling, as Zeno of Citium afterwards 
<A NAME="86"></A>declared, I do not think it necessary to go further into this question 
<A NAME="87"></A>in the present treatise; for immediate purposes we only need to recognize 
<A NAME="88"></A>the complete alteration of substance. In this way, nobody will suppose 
<A NAME="89"></A>that bread represents a kind of meeting-place for bone, flesh, nerve, and 
<A NAME="90"></A>all the other parts, and that each of these subsequently becomes separated 
<A NAME="91"></A>in the body and goes to join its own kind; before any separation takes 
<A NAME="92"></A>place, the whole of the bread obviously becomes blood; (at any rate, if 
<A NAME="93"></A>a man takes no other food for a prolonged period, he will have blood enclosed 
<A NAME="94"></A>in his veins all the same). And clearly this disproves the view of those 
<A NAME="95"></A>who consider the elements unchangeable, as also, for that matter, does 
<A NAME="96"></A>the oil which is entirely used up in the flame of the lamp, or the faggots 
<A NAME="97"></A>which, in a somewhat longer time, turn into fire.
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR>I said, however, that I was not going to enter into an argument 
<A NAME="99"></A>with these people, and it was only because the example was drawn from the 
<A NAME="100"></A>subject-matter of medicine, and because I need it for the present treatise, 
<A NAME="101"></A>that I have mentioned it. We shall then, as I said, renounce our controversy 
<A NAME="102"></A>with them, since those who wish may get a good grasp of the views of the 
<A NAME="103"></A>ancients from our own personal investigations into these 
<A NAME="104"></A>matters.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR>The discussion which follows we shall devote entirely, as we originally 
<A NAME="106"></A>proposed, to an enquiry into the number and character of the faculties 
<A NAME="107"></A>of Nature, and what is the effect which each naturally produces. Now, of 
<A NAME="108"></A>course, I mean by an effect that which has already come into existence 
<A NAME="109"></A>and has been completed by the activity of these faculties- for example, 
<A NAME="110"></A>blood, flesh, or nerve. And activity is the name I give to the active change 
<A NAME="111"></A>or motion, and the cause of this I call a faculty. Thus, when food turns 
<A NAME="112"></A>into blood, the motion of the food is passive, and that of the vein active. 
<A NAME="113"></A>Similarly, when the limbs have their position their position altered, it 
<A NAME="114"></A>is the muscle which produces, and the bones which undergo the motion. In 
<A NAME="115"></A>these cases I call the motion of the vein and of the muscle an activity, 
<A NAME="116"></A>and that of the food and the bones a symptom or affection, since the first 
<A NAME="117"></A>group undergoes alteration and the second group is merely transported. 
<A NAME="118"></A>One might, therefore, also speak of the activity as an effect of Nature- 
<A NAME="119"></A>for example, digestion, absorption, blood-production; one could not, however, 
<A NAME="120"></A>in every case call the effect an activity; thus flesh is an effect of Nature, 
<A NAME="121"></A>but it is, of course, not an activity. It is, therefore, clear that one 
<A NAME="122"></A>of these terms is used in two senses, but not the other.
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>3. It appears to me, then, that the vein, as well as each of the 
<A NAME="124"></A>other parts, functions in such and such a way according to the manner in 
<A NAME="125"></A>which the four qualities are mixed. There are, however, a considerable 
<A NAME="126"></A>number of not undistinguished men- philosophers and physicians- who refer 
<A NAME="127"></A>action to the Warm and the Cold, and who subordinate to these, as passive, 
<A NAME="128"></A>the Dry and the Moist; Aristotle, in fact, was the first who attempted 
<A NAME="129"></A>to bring back the causes of the various special activities to these principles, 
<A NAME="130"></A>and he was followed later by the Stoic school. These latter, of course, 
<A NAME="131"></A>could logically make active principles of the Warm and Cold, since they 
<A NAME="132"></A>refer the change of the elements themselves into one another to certain 
<A NAME="133"></A>diffusions and condensations. This does not hold of Aristotle, however; 
<A NAME="134"></A>seeing that he employed the four qualities to explain the genesis of the 
<A NAME="135"></A>elements, he ought properly to have also referred the causes of all the 
<A NAME="136"></A>special activities to these. How is it that he uses the four qualities 
<A NAME="137"></A>in his book "On Genesis and Destruction," whilst in his "Meteorology," 
<A NAME="138"></A>his "Problems," and many other works he uses the uses the two only? Of 
<A NAME="139"></A>course, if anyone were to maintain that in the case of animals and plants 
<A NAME="140"></A>the Warm and Cold are more active, the Dry and Moist less so, he might 
<A NAME="141"></A>perhaps have even Hippocrates on his side; but if he were to say that this 
<A NAME="142"></A>happens in all cases, he would, I imagine, lack support, not merely from 
<A NAME="143"></A>Hippocrates, but even from Aristotle himself- if, at least, Aristotle chose 
<A NAME="144"></A>to remember what he himself taught us in his work "On Genesis and Destruction," 
<A NAME="145"></A>not as a matter of simple statement, but with an accompanying demonstration. 
<A NAME="146"></A>I have, however, also investigated these questions, in so far as they are 
<A NAME="147"></A>of value to a physician, in my work "On Temperaments."
<A NAME="148"></A><BR><BR>4. The so-called blood-making faculty in the veins, then, as well 
<A NAME="149"></A>as all the other faculties, fall within the category of relative concepts; 
<A NAME="150"></A>primarily because the faculty is the cause of the activity, but also, accidentally, 
<A NAME="151"></A>because it is the cause of the effect. But, if the cause is relative to 
<A NAME="152"></A>something- for it is the cause of what results from it, and of nothing 
<A NAME="153"></A>else- it is obvious that the faculty also falls into the category of the 
<A NAME="154"></A>relative; and so long as we are ignorant of the true essence of the cause 
<A NAME="155"></A>which is operating, we call it a faculty. Thus we say that there exists 
<A NAME="156"></A>in the veins a blood-making faculty, as also a digestive faculty in the 
<A NAME="157"></A>stomach, a pulsatile faculty in the heart, and in each of the other parts 
<A NAME="158"></A>a special faculty corresponding to the function or activity of that part. 
<A NAME="159"></A>If, therefore, we are to investigate methodically the number and kinds 
<A NAME="160"></A>of faculties, we must begin with the effects; for each of these effects 
<A NAME="161"></A>comes from a certain activity, and each of these again is preceded by a 
<A NAME="162"></A>cause.
<A NAME="163"></A><BR><BR>5. The effects of Nature, then, while the animal is still being 
<A NAME="164"></A>formed in the womb, are all the different parts of its body; and after 
<A NAME="165"></A>it has been born, an effect in which all parts share is the progress of 
<A NAME="166"></A>each to its full size, and thereafter its maintenance of itself as long 
<A NAME="167"></A>as possible.
<A NAME="168"></A><BR><BR>The activities corresponding to the three effects mentioned are 
<A NAME="169"></A>necessarily three- one to each- namely, Genesis, Growth, and Nutrition. 
<A NAME="170"></A>Genesis, however, is not a simple activity of Nature, but is compounded 
<A NAME="171"></A>of alteration and of shaping. That is to say, in order that bone, nerve, 
<A NAME="172"></A>veins, and all other [tissues] may come into existence, the underlying 
<A NAME="173"></A>substance from which the animal springs must be altered; and in order that 
<A NAME="174"></A>the substance so altered may acquire its appropriate shape and position, 
<A NAME="175"></A>its cavities, outgrowths, attachments, and so forth, it has to undergo 
<A NAME="176"></A>a shaping or formative process. One would be justified in calling this 
<A NAME="177"></A>substance which undergoes alteration the material of the animal, just as 
<A NAME="178"></A>wood is the material of a ship, and wax of an image.
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR>Growth is an increase and expansion in length, breadth, and thickness 
<A NAME="180"></A>of the solid parts of the animal (those which have been subjected to the 
<A NAME="181"></A>moulding or shaping process). Nutrition is an addition to these, without 
<A NAME="182"></A>expansion.
<A NAME="183"></A><BR><BR>6. Let us speak then, in the first place, of Genesis, which, as 
<A NAME="184"></A>we have said, results from alteration together with 
<A NAME="185"></A>shaping.
<A NAME="186"></A><BR><BR>The seed having been cast into the womb or into the earth (for 
<A NAME="187"></A>there is no difference), then, after a certain definite period, a great 
<A NAME="188"></A>number of parts become constituted in the substance which is being generated; 
<A NAME="189"></A>these differ as regards moisture, dryness, coldness and warmth, and in 
<A NAME="190"></A>all the other qualities which naturally derive therefrom. These derivative 
<A NAME="191"></A>qualities, you are acquainted with, if you have given any sort of scientific 
<A NAME="192"></A>consideration to the question of genesis and destruction. For, first and 
<A NAME="193"></A>foremost after the qualities mentioned come the other so-called tangible 
<A NAME="194"></A>distinctions, and after them those which appeal to taste, smell, and sight. 
<A NAME="195"></A>Now, tangible distinctions are hardness and softness, viscosity, friability, 
<A NAME="196"></A>lightness, heaviness, density, rarity, smoothness, roughness, thickness 
<A NAME="197"></A>and thinness; all of these have been duly mentioned by Aristotle. And of 
<A NAME="198"></A>course you know those which appeal to taste, smell, and sight. Therefore, 
<A NAME="199"></A>if you wish to know which alterative faculties are primary and elementary, 
<A NAME="200"></A>they are moisture, dryness, coldness, and warmth, and if you wish to know 
<A NAME="201"></A>which ones arise from the combination of these, they will be found to be 
<A NAME="202"></A>in each animal of a number corresponding to its sensible elements. The 
<A NAME="203"></A>name sensible elements is given to all the homogeneous parts of the body, 
<A NAME="204"></A>and these are to be detected not by any system, but by personal observation 
<A NAME="205"></A>of dissections.
<A NAME="206"></A><BR><BR>Now Nature constructs bone, cartilage, nerve, membrane, ligament, 
<A NAME="207"></A>vein, and so forth, at the first stage of the animal's genesis, employing 
<A NAME="208"></A>at this task a faculty which is, in general terms, generative and alterative, 
<A NAME="209"></A>and, in more detail, warming, chilling, drying, or moistening; or such 
<A NAME="210"></A>as spring from the blending of these, for example, the bone-producing, 
<A NAME="211"></A>nerve-producing, and cartilage-producing faculties (since for the sake 
<A NAME="212"></A>of clearness these names must be used as well).
<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR>Now the peculiar flesh of the liver is of this kind as well, also 
<A NAME="214"></A>that of the spleen, that of the kidneys, that of the lungs, and that of 
<A NAME="215"></A>the heart; so also the proper substance of the brain, stomach, gullet, 
<A NAME="216"></A>intestines, and uterus is a sensible element, of similar parts all through, 
<A NAME="217"></A>simple, and uncompounded. That is to say, if you remove from each of the 
<A NAME="218"></A>organs mentioned its arteries, veins, and nerves, the substance remaining 
<A NAME="219"></A>in each organ is, from the point of view of the senses, simple and elementary. 
<A NAME="220"></A>As regards those organs consisting of two dissimilar coats, of which each 
<A NAME="221"></A>is simple, of these organs the coats are the are the elements- for example, 
<A NAME="222"></A>the coats of the stomach, oesophagus, intestines, and arteries; each of 
<A NAME="223"></A>these two coats has an alterative faculty peculiar to it, which has engendered 
<A NAME="224"></A>it from the menstrual blood of the mother. Thus the special alterative 
<A NAME="225"></A>faculties in each animal are of the same number as the elementary parts; 
<A NAME="226"></A>and further, the activities must necessarily correspond each to one of 
<A NAME="227"></A>the special parts, just as each part has its special use- for example, 
<A NAME="228"></A>those ducts which extend from the kidneys into the bladder, and which are 
<A NAME="229"></A>called ureters; for these are not arteries, since they do not pulsate nor 
<A NAME="230"></A>do they consist of two coats; and they are not veins, since they neither 
<A NAME="231"></A>contain blood, nor do their coats in any way resemble those of veins; from 
<A NAME="232"></A>nerves they differ still more than from the structures 
<A NAME="233"></A>mentioned.
<A NAME="234"></A><BR><BR>"What, then, are they?" someone asks- as though every part must 
<A NAME="235"></A>necessarily be either an artery, a vein, a nerve, or a complex of these, 
<A NAME="236"></A>and as though the truth were not what I am now stating, namely, that every 
<A NAME="237"></A>one of the various organs has its own particular substance. For in fact 
<A NAME="238"></A>the two bladders- that which receives the urine, and that which receives 
<A NAME="239"></A>the yellow bile- not only differ from all other organs, but also from one 
<A NAME="240"></A>another. Further, the ducts which spring out like kinds of conduits from 
<A NAME="241"></A>the gall-bladder and which pass into the liver have no resemblance either 
<A NAME="242"></A>to arteries, veins or nerves. But these parts have been treated at a greater 
<A NAME="243"></A>length in my work "On the Anatomy of Hippocrates," as well as 
<A NAME="244"></A>elsewhere.
<A NAME="245"></A><BR><BR>As for the actual substance of the coats of the stomach, intestine, 
<A NAME="246"></A>and uterus, each of these has been rendered what it is by a special alterative 
<A NAME="247"></A>faculty of Nature; while the bringing of these together, the therewith 
<A NAME="248"></A>of the structures which are inserted into them, the outgrowth into the 
<A NAME="249"></A>intestine, the shape of the inner cavities, and the like, have all been 
<A NAME="250"></A>determined by a faculty which we call the shaping or formative faculty; 
<A NAME="251"></A>this faculty we also state to be artistic- nay, the best and highest art- 
<A NAME="252"></A>doing everything for some purpose, so that there is nothing ineffective 
<A NAME="253"></A>or superfluous, or capable of being better disposed. This, however, I shall 
<A NAME="254"></A>demonstrate in my work "On the Use of Parts."
<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR>7. Passing now to the faculty of Growth let us first mention that 
<A NAME="256"></A>this, too, is present in the foetus in utero as is also the nutritive faculty, 
<A NAME="257"></A>but that at that stage these two faculties are, as it were, handmaids to 
<A NAME="258"></A>those already mentioned, and do not possess in themselves supreme authority. 
<A NAME="259"></A>When, however, the animal has attained its complete size, then, during 
<A NAME="260"></A>the whole period following its birth and until the acme is reached, the 
<A NAME="261"></A>faculty of growth is predominant, while the alterative and nutritive faculties 
<A NAME="262"></A>are accessory- in fact, act as its handmaids. What, then, is the property 
<A NAME="263"></A>of this faculty of growth? To extend in every direction that which has 
<A NAME="264"></A>already come into existence- that is to say, the solid parts of the body, 
<A NAME="265"></A>the arteries, veins, nerves, bones, cartilages, membranes, ligaments, and 
<A NAME="266"></A>the various coats which we have just called elementary, homogeneous, and 
<A NAME="267"></A>simple. And I shall state in what way they gain this extension in every 
<A NAME="268"></A>direction, first giving an illustration for the sake of 
<A NAME="269"></A>clearness.
<A NAME="270"></A><BR><BR>Children take the bladders of pigs, fill them with air, and then 
<A NAME="271"></A>rub them on ashes near the fire, so as to warm, but not to injure them. 
<A NAME="272"></A>This is a common game in the district of Ionia, and among not a few other 
<A NAME="273"></A>nations. As they rub, they sing songs, to a certain measure, time, and 
<A NAME="274"></A>rhythm, and all their words are an exhortation to the bladder to increase 
<A NAME="275"></A>in size. When it appears to them fairly well distended, they again blow 
<A NAME="276"></A>air into it and expand it further; then they rub it again. This they do 
<A NAME="277"></A>several times, until the bladder seems to them to have become large enough. 
<A NAME="278"></A>Now, clearly, in these doings of the children, the more the interior cavity 
<A NAME="279"></A>of the bladder increases in size, the thinner, necessarily, does its substance 
<A NAME="280"></A>become. But, if the children were able to bring nourishment to this thin 
<A NAME="281"></A>part, then they would make the bladder big in the same way that Nature 
<A NAME="282"></A>does. As it is, however, they cannot do what Nature does, for to imitate 
<A NAME="283"></A>this is beyond the power not only of children, but of any one soever; it 
<A NAME="284"></A>is a property of Nature alone.
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>It will now, therefore, be clear to you that nutrition is a necessity 
<A NAME="286"></A>for growing things. For if such bodies were distended, but not at the same 
<A NAME="287"></A>time nourished, they would take on a false appearance of growth, not a 
<A NAME="288"></A>true growth. And further, to be distended in all directions belongs only 
<A NAME="289"></A>to bodies whose growth is directed by Nature; for those which are distended 
<A NAME="290"></A>by us undergo this distension in one direction but grow less in the others; 
<A NAME="291"></A>it is impossible to find a body which will remain entire and not be torn 
<A NAME="292"></A>through whilst we stretch it in the three dimensions. Thus Nature alone 
<A NAME="293"></A>has the power to expand a body in all directions so that it remains unruptured 
<A NAME="294"></A>and preserves completely its previous form.
<A NAME="295"></A><BR><BR>Such then is growth, and it cannot occur without the nutriment 
<A NAME="296"></A>which flows to the part and is worked up into it.
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR>8. We have, then, it seems, arrived at the subject of Nutrition, 
<A NAME="298"></A>which is the third and remaining consideration which we proposed at the 
<A NAME="299"></A>outset. For, when the matter which flows to each part of the body in the 
<A NAME="300"></A>form of nutriment is being worked up into it, this activity is nutrition, 
<A NAME="301"></A>and its cause is the nutritive faculty. Of course, the kind of activity 
<A NAME="302"></A>here involved is also an alteration, but not an alteration like that occurring 
<A NAME="303"></A>at the stage of genesis. For in the latter case something comes into existence 
<A NAME="304"></A>which did not exist previously, while in nutrition the inflowing material 
<A NAME="305"></A>becomes assimilated to that which has already come into existence. Therefore, 
<A NAME="306"></A>the former kind of alteration has with reason been termed genesis, and 
<A NAME="307"></A>the latter, assimilation.
<A NAME="308"></A><BR><BR>9. Now, since the three faculties of Nature have been exhaustively 
<A NAME="309"></A>dealt with, and the animal would appear not to need any others (being possessed 
<A NAME="310"></A>of the means for growing, for attaining completion, and for maintaining 
<A NAME="311"></A>itself as long a time as possible), this treatise might seem to be already 
<A NAME="312"></A>complete, and to constitute an exposition of all the faculties of Nature. 
<A NAME="313"></A>If, however, one considers that it has not yet touched upon any of the 
<A NAME="314"></A>parts of the animal (I mean the stomach, intestines, liver, and the like), 
<A NAME="315"></A>and that it has not dealt with the faculties resident in these, it will 
<A NAME="316"></A>seem as though merely a kind of introduction had been given to the practical 
<A NAME="317"></A>parts of our teaching. For the whole matter is as follows: Genesis, growth, 
<A NAME="318"></A>and nutrition are the first, and, so to say, the principal effects of Nature; 
<A NAME="319"></A>similarly also the faculties which produce these effects- the first faculties- 
<A NAME="320"></A>are three in number, and are the most dominating of all. But as has already 
<A NAME="321"></A>been shown, these need the service both of each other, and of yet different 
<A NAME="322"></A>faculties. Now, these which the faculties of generation and growth require 
<A NAME="323"></A>have been stated. I shall now say what ones the nutritive faculty 
<A NAME="324"></A>requires.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR>10. For I believe that I shall prove that the organs which have 
<A NAME="326"></A>to do with the disposal of the nutriment, as also their faculties, exist 
<A NAME="327"></A>for the sake of this nutritive faculty. For since the action of this faculty 
<A NAME="328"></A>is assimilation, and it is impossible for anything to be assimilated by, 
<A NAME="329"></A>and to change into anything else unless they already possess a certain 
<A NAME="330"></A>community and affinity in their qualities, therefore, in the first place, 
<A NAME="331"></A>any animal cannot naturally derive nourishment from any kind of food, and 
<A NAME="332"></A>secondly, even in the case of those from which it can do so, it cannot 
<A NAME="333"></A>do this at once. Therefore, by reason of this law, every animal needs several 
<A NAME="334"></A>organs for altering the nutriment. For in order that the yellow may become 
<A NAME="335"></A>red, and the red yellow, one simple process of alteration is required, 
<A NAME="336"></A>but in order that the white may become black, and the black white, all 
<A NAME="337"></A>the intermediate stages are needed. So also, a thing which is very soft 
<A NAME="338"></A>cannot all at once become very hard, nor vice versa; nor, similarly can 
<A NAME="339"></A>anything which has a very bad smell suddenly become quite fragrant, nor 
<A NAME="340"></A>again, can the converse happen.
<A NAME="341"></A><BR><BR>How, then, could blood ever turn into bone, without having first 
<A NAME="342"></A>become, as far as possible, thickened and white? And how could bread turn 
<A NAME="343"></A>into blood without having gradually parted with its whiteness and gradually 
<A NAME="344"></A>acquired redness? Thus it is quite easy for blood to become flesh; for, 
<A NAME="345"></A>if Nature thicken it to such an extent that it acquires a certain consistency 
<A NAME="346"></A>and ceases to be fluid, it thus becomes original newly-formed flesh; but 
<A NAME="347"></A>in order that blood may turn into bone, much time is needed and much elaboration 
<A NAME="348"></A>and transformation of the blood. Further, it is quite clear that bread, 
<A NAME="349"></A>and, more particularly lettuce, beet, and the like, require a great deal 
<A NAME="350"></A>of alteration, in order to become blood.
<A NAME="351"></A><BR><BR>This, then, is one reason why there are so many organs concerned 
<A NAME="352"></A>in the alteration of food. A second reason is the nature of the superfluities. 
<A NAME="353"></A>For, as we are unable to draw any nourishment from grass, although this 
<A NAME="354"></A>is possible for cattle, similarly we can derive nourishment from radishes, 
<A NAME="355"></A>albeit not to the same extent as from meat; for almost the whole of the 
<A NAME="356"></A>latter is mastered by our natures; it is transformed and altered and constituted 
<A NAME="357"></A>useful blood; but, not withstanding, in the radish, what is appropriate 
<A NAME="358"></A>and capable of being altered (and that only with difficulty, and with much 
<A NAME="359"></A>labour) is the very smallest part; almost the whole of it is surplus matter, 
<A NAME="360"></A>and passes through the digestive organs, only a very little being taken 
<A NAME="361"></A>up into the veins as blood- nor is this itself entirely utilisable blood. 
<A NAME="362"></A>Nature, therefore, had need of a second process of separation for the superfluities 
<A NAME="363"></A>in the veins. Moreover, these superfluities need, on the one hand, certain 
<A NAME="364"></A>fresh routes to conduct them to the outlets, so that they may not spoil 
<A NAME="365"></A>the useful substances, and they also need certain reservoirs, as it were, 
<A NAME="366"></A>in which they are collected till they reach a sufficient quantity, and 
<A NAME="367"></A>are then discharged.
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR>Thus, then, you have discovered bodily parts of a second kind, 
<A NAME="369"></A>consecrated in this case to the [removal of the] superfluities of the food. 
<A NAME="370"></A>There is, however, also a third kind, for carrying the pabulum in every 
<A NAME="371"></A>direction; these are like a number of roads intersecting the whole 
<A NAME="372"></A>body.
<A NAME="373"></A><BR><BR>Thus there is one entrance- that through the mouth- for all the 
<A NAME="374"></A>various articles of food. What receives nourishment, however, is not one 
<A NAME="375"></A>single part, but a great many parts, and these widely separated; do not 
<A NAME="376"></A>be surprised, therefore, at the abundance of organs which Nature has created 
<A NAME="377"></A>for the purpose of nutrition. For those of them which have to do with alteration 
<A NAME="378"></A>prepare the nutriment suitable for each part; others separate out the superfluities; 
<A NAME="379"></A>some pass these along, others store them up, others excrete them; some, 
<A NAME="380"></A>again, are paths for the transit in all directions of the utilisable juices. 
<A NAME="381"></A>So, if you wish to gain a thorough acquaintance with all the faculties 
<A NAME="382"></A>of Nature, you will have consider each one of these 
<A NAME="383"></A>organs.
<A NAME="384"></A><BR><BR>Now in giving an account of these we must begin with those effects 
<A NAME="385"></A>of Nature, together with their corresponding parts and faculties, which 
<A NAME="386"></A>are closely connected with the purpose to be achieved.
<A NAME="387"></A><BR><BR>11. Let us once more, then, recall the actual purpose for which 
<A NAME="388"></A>Nature has constructed all these parts. Its name, as previously stated, 
<A NAME="389"></A>is nutrition, and the definition corresponding to the name is: an assimilation 
<A NAME="390"></A>of that which nourishes to that which receives nourishment. And in order 
<A NAME="391"></A>that this may come about, we must assume a preliminary process of adhesion, 
<A NAME="392"></A>and for that, again, one of presentation. For whenever the juice which 
<A NAME="393"></A>is destined to nourish any of the parts of the animal is emitted from the 
<A NAME="394"></A>vessels, it is in the first place dispersed all through this part, next 
<A NAME="395"></A>it is presented, and next it adheres, and becomes completely 
<A NAME="396"></A>assimilated.
<A NAME="397"></A><BR><BR>The so-called white [leprosy] shows the difference between assimilation 
<A NAME="398"></A>and adhesion, in the same way that the kind of dropsy which some people 
<A NAME="399"></A>call anasarca clearly distinguishes presentation from adhesion. For, of 
<A NAME="400"></A>course, the genesis of such a dropsy does not come about as do some of 
<A NAME="401"></A>the conditions of atrophy and wasting, from an insufficient supply of moisture; 
<A NAME="402"></A>the flesh is obviously moist enough,- in fact it is thoroughly saturated,- 
<A NAME="403"></A>and each of the solid parts of the body is in a similar condition. While, 
<A NAME="404"></A>however, the nutriment conveyed to the part does undergo presentation, 
<A NAME="405"></A>it is still too watery, and is not properly transformed into a juice, nor 
<A NAME="406"></A>has it acquired that viscous and agglutinative quality which results from 
<A NAME="407"></A>the operation of innate heat; therefore, adhesion cannot come about, since, 
<A NAME="408"></A>owing to this abundance of thin, crude liquid, the pabulum runs off and 
<A NAME="409"></A>easily slips away from the solid parts of the body. In white [leprosy], 
<A NAME="410"></A>again, there is adhesion of the nutriment but no real assimilation. From 
<A NAME="411"></A>this it is clear that what I have just said is correct, namely, that in 
<A NAME="412"></A>that part which is to be nourished there must first occur presentation, 
<A NAME="413"></A>next adhesion, and finally assimilation proper.
<A NAME="414"></A><BR><BR>Strictly speaking, then, nutriment is that which is actually nourishing, 
<A NAME="415"></A>while the quasi-nutriment which is not yet nourishing (e.g. matter which 
<A NAME="416"></A>is undergoing adhesion or presentation) is not, strictly speaking, nutriment, 
<A NAME="417"></A>but is so called only by an equivocation. Also, that which is still contained 
<A NAME="418"></A>in the veins, and still more, that which is in the stomach, from the fact 
<A NAME="419"></A>that it is destined to nourish if properly elaborated, has been called 
<A NAME="420"></A>"nutriment." Similarly we call the various kinds of food "nutriment," not 
<A NAME="421"></A>because they are already nourishing the animal, nor because they exist 
<A NAME="422"></A>in the same state as the material which actually is nourishing it, but 
<A NAME="423"></A>because they are able and destined to nourish it if they be properly 
<A NAME="424"></A>elaborated.
<A NAME="425"></A><BR><BR>This was also what Hippocrates said, viz., "Nutriment is what is 
<A NAME="426"></A>engaged in nourishing, as also is quasi-nutriment, and what is destined 
<A NAME="427"></A>to be nutriment." For to that which is already being assimilated he gave 
<A NAME="428"></A>the name of nutriment; to the similar material which is being presented 
<A NAME="429"></A>or becoming adherent, the name of quasi-nutriment; and to everything else- 
<A NAME="430"></A>that is, contained in the stomach and veins- the name of destined 
<A NAME="431"></A>nutriment.
<A NAME="432"></A><BR><BR>12. It is quite clear, therefore, that nutrition must necessarily 
<A NAME="433"></A>be a process of assimilation of that which is nourishing to that which 
<A NAME="434"></A>is being nourished. Some, however, say that this assimilation does not 
<A NAME="435"></A>occur in reality, but is merely apparent; these are the people who think 
<A NAME="436"></A>that Nature is not artistic, that she does not show forethought for the 
<A NAME="437"></A>animal's welfare, and that she has absolutely no native powers whereby 
<A NAME="438"></A>she alters some substances, attracts others, and discharges 
<A NAME="439"></A>others.
<A NAME="440"></A><BR><BR>Now, speaking generally, there have arisen the following two sects 
<A NAME="441"></A>in medicine and philosophy among those who have made any definite pronouncement 
<A NAME="442"></A>regarding Nature. I speak, of course, of such of them as know what they 
<A NAME="443"></A>are talking about, and who realize the logical sequence of their hypotheses, 
<A NAME="444"></A>and stand by them; as for those who cannot understand even this, but who 
<A NAME="445"></A>simply talk any nonsense that comes to their tongues, and who do not remain 
<A NAME="446"></A>definitely attached either to one sect or the other- such people are not 
<A NAME="447"></A>even worth mentioning.
<A NAME="448"></A><BR><BR>What, then, are these sects, and what are the logical consequences 
<A NAME="449"></A>of their hypotheses? The one class supposes that all substance which is 
<A NAME="450"></A>subject to genesis and destruction is at once continuous and susceptible 
<A NAME="451"></A>of alteration. The other school assumes substance to be unchangeable, unalterable, 
<A NAME="452"></A>and subdivided into fine particles, which are separated from one another 
<A NAME="453"></A>by empty spaces.
<A NAME="454"></A><BR><BR>All people, therefore, who can appreciate the logical sequence 
<A NAME="455"></A>of an hypothesis hold that, according to the second teaching, there does 
<A NAME="456"></A>not exist any substance or faculty peculiar either to Nature or to Soul, 
<A NAME="457"></A>but that these result from the way in which the primary corpuscles, which 
<A NAME="458"></A>are unaffected by change, come together. According to the first-mentioned 
<A NAME="459"></A>teaching, on the other hand, Nature is not posterior to the corpuscles, 
<A NAME="460"></A>but is a long way prior to them and older than they; and therefore in their 
<A NAME="461"></A>view it is Nature which puts together the bodies both of plants and animals; 
<A NAME="462"></A>and this she does by virtue of certain faculties which she possesses- these 
<A NAME="463"></A>being, on the one hand, attractive and assimilative of what is appropriate, 
<A NAME="464"></A>and, on the other, of what is foreign. Further, she skilfully moulds everything 
<A NAME="465"></A>during the stage of genesis; and she also provides for the creatures after 
<A NAME="466"></A>birth, employing here other faculties again, namely, one of affection and 
<A NAME="467"></A>forethought for offspring, and one of sociability and friendship for kindred. 
<A NAME="468"></A>According to the other school, none of these things exist in the natures 
<A NAME="469"></A>[of living things], nor is there in the soul any original innate idea, 
<A NAME="470"></A>whether of agreement or difference, of separation or synthesis, of justice 
<A NAME="471"></A>or injustice, of the beautiful or ugly; all such things, they say, arise 
<A NAME="472"></A>in us from sensation and through sensation, and animals are steered by 
<A NAME="473"></A>certain images and memories.
<A NAME="474"></A><BR><BR>Some of these people have even expressly declared that the soul 
<A NAME="475"></A>possesses no reasoning faculty, but that we are led like cattle by the 
<A NAME="476"></A>impression of our senses, and are unable to refuse or dissent from anything. 
<A NAME="477"></A>In their view, obviously, courage, wisdom, temperance, and self-control 
<A NAME="478"></A>are all mere nonsense, we do not love either each other or our offspring, 
<A NAME="479"></A>nor do the gods care anything for us. This school also despises dreams, 
<A NAME="480"></A>birds, omens, and the whole of astrology, subjects with which we have dealt 
<A NAME="481"></A>at greater length in another work, in which we discuss the views of Asclepiades 
<A NAME="482"></A>the physician. Those who wish to do so may familiarize themselves with 
<A NAME="483"></A>these arguments, and they may also consider at this point which of the 
<A NAME="484"></A>two roads lying before us is the better one to take. Hippocrates took the 
<A NAME="485"></A>first-mentioned. According to this teaching, substance is one and is subject 
<A NAME="486"></A>to alteration; there is a consensus in the movements of air and fluid throughout 
<A NAME="487"></A>the whole body; Nature acts throughout in an artistic and equitable manner, 
<A NAME="488"></A>having certain faculties, by virtue of which each part of the body draws 
<A NAME="489"></A>to itself the juice which is proper to it, and, having done so, attaches 
<A NAME="490"></A>it to every portion of itself, and completely assimilates it; while such 
<A NAME="491"></A>part of the juice as has not been mastered, and is not capable of undergoing 
<A NAME="492"></A>complete alteration and being assimilated to the part which is being nourished, 
<A NAME="493"></A>is got rid of by yet another (an expulsive) faculty.
<A NAME="494"></A><BR><BR>13. Now the extent of exactitude and truth in the doctrines of 
<A NAME="495"></A>Hippocrates may be gauged, not merely from the way in which his opponents 
<A NAME="496"></A>are at variance with obvious facts, but also from the various subjects 
<A NAME="497"></A>of natural research themselves- the functions of animals, and the rest. 
<A NAME="498"></A>For those people who do not believe that there exists in any part of the 
<A NAME="499"></A>animal a faculty for attracting its own special quality are compelled repeatedly 
<A NAME="500"></A>to deny obvious facts. For instance, Asclepiades, the physician, did this 
<A NAME="501"></A>in the case of the kidneys. That these are organs for secreting [separating 
<A NAME="502"></A>out] the urine, was the belief not only of Hippocrates, Diocles, Erasistratus, 
<A NAME="503"></A>Praxagoras, and all other physicians of eminence, but practically every 
<A NAME="504"></A>butcher is aware of this, from the fact that he daily observes both the 
<A NAME="505"></A>position of the kidneys and the duct (termed the ureter) which runs from 
<A NAME="506"></A>each kidney into the bladder, and from this arrangement he infers their 
<A NAME="507"></A>characteristic use and faculty. But, even leaving the butchers aside, all 
<A NAME="508"></A>people who suffer either from frequent dysuria or from retention of urine 
<A NAME="509"></A>call themselves "nephritics," when they feel pain in the loins and pass 
<A NAME="510"></A>sandy matter in their water.
<A NAME="511"></A><BR><BR>I do not suppose that Asclepiades ever saw a stone which had been 
<A NAME="512"></A>passed by one of these sufferers, or observed that this was preceded by 
<A NAME="513"></A>a sharp pain in the region between kidneys and bladder as the stone traversed 
<A NAME="514"></A>the ureter, or that, when the stone was passed, both the pain and the retention 
<A NAME="515"></A>at once ceased. It is worth while, then, learning how his theory accounts 
<A NAME="516"></A>for the presence of urine in the bladder, and one is forced to marvel at 
<A NAME="517"></A>the ingenuity of a man who puts aside these broad, clearly visible routes, 
<A NAME="518"></A>and postulates others which are narrow, invisible- indeed, entirely imperceptible. 
<A NAME="519"></A>His view, in fact, is that the fluid which we drink passes into the bladder 
<A NAME="520"></A>by being resolved into vapours, and that, when these have been again condensed, 
<A NAME="521"></A>it thus regains its previous form, and turns from vapour into fluid. He 
<A NAME="522"></A>simply looks upon the bladder as a sponge or a piece of wool, and not as 
<A NAME="523"></A>the perfectly compact and impervious body that it is, with two very strong 
<A NAME="524"></A>coats. For if we say that the vapours pass through these coats, why should 
<A NAME="525"></A>they not pass through the peritoneum and the diaphragm, thus filling the 
<A NAME="526"></A>whole abdominal cavity and thorax with water? "But," says he, "of course 
<A NAME="527"></A>the peritoneal coat is more impervious than the bladder, and this is why 
<A NAME="528"></A>it keeps out the vapours, while the bladder admits them." Yet if he had 
<A NAME="529"></A>ever practised anatomy, he might have known that the outer coat of the 
<A NAME="530"></A>bladder springs from the peritoneum and is essentially the same as it, 
<A NAME="531"></A>and that the inner coat, which is peculiar to the bladder, is more than 
<A NAME="532"></A>twice as thick as the former.
<A NAME="533"></A><BR><BR>Perhaps, however, it is not the thickness or thinness of the coats, 
<A NAME="534"></A>but the situation of the bladder, which is the reason for the vapours being 
<A NAME="535"></A>carried into it? On the contrary, even if it were probable for every other 
<A NAME="536"></A>reason that the vapours accumulate there, yet the situation of the bladder 
<A NAME="537"></A>would be enough in itself to prevent this. For the bladder is situated 
<A NAME="538"></A>below, whereas vapours have a natural tendency to rise upwards; thus they 
<A NAME="539"></A>would fill all the region of the thorax and lungs long before they came 
<A NAME="540"></A>to the bladder.
<A NAME="541"></A><BR><BR>But why do I mention the situation of the bladder, peritoneum, 
<A NAME="542"></A>and thorax? For surely, when the vapours have passed through the coats 
<A NAME="543"></A>of the stomach and intestines, it is in the space between these and the 
<A NAME="544"></A>peritoneum that they will collect and become liquefied (just as in dropsical 
<A NAME="545"></A>subjects it is in this region that most of the water gathers). Otherwise 
<A NAME="546"></A>the vapours must necessarily pass straight forward through everything which 
<A NAME="547"></A>in any way comes in contact with them, and will never come to a standstill. 
<A NAME="548"></A>But, if this be assumed, then they will traverse not merely the peritoneum 
<A NAME="549"></A>but also the epigastrium, and will become dispersed into the surrounding 
<A NAME="550"></A>air; otherwise they will certainly collect under the 
<A NAME="551"></A>skin.
<A NAME="552"></A><BR><BR>Even these considerations, however, our present-day Asclepiadeans 
<A NAME="553"></A>attempt to answer, despite the fact that they always get soundly laughed 
<A NAME="554"></A>at by all who happen to be present at their disputations on these subjects- 
<A NAME="555"></A>so difficult an evil to get rid of is this sectarian partizanship, so excessively 
<A NAME="556"></A>resistant to all cleansing processes, harder to heal than any 
<A NAME="557"></A>itch!
<A NAME="558"></A><BR><BR>Thus, one of our Sophists who is a thoroughly hardened disputer 
<A NAME="559"></A>and as skilful a master of language as there ever was, once got into a 
<A NAME="560"></A>discussion with me on this subject; so far from being put out of countenance 
<A NAME="561"></A>by any of the above-mentioned considerations, he even expressed his surprise 
<A NAME="562"></A>that I should try to overturn obvious facts by ridiculous arguments! "For," 
<A NAME="563"></A>said he, "one may clearly observe any day in the case of any bladder, that, 
<A NAME="564"></A>if one fills it with water or air and then ties up its neck and squeezes 
<A NAME="565"></A>it all round, it does not let anything out at any point, but accurately 
<A NAME="566"></A>retains all its contents. And surely," said he, "if there were any large 
<A NAME="567"></A>and perceptible channels coming into it from the kidneys the liquid would 
<A NAME="568"></A>run out through these when the bladder was squeezed, in the same way that 
<A NAME="569"></A>it entered?" Having abruptly made these and similar remarks in precise 
<A NAME="570"></A>and clear tones, he concluded by jumping up and departing- leaving me as 
<A NAME="571"></A>though I were quite incapable of finding any plausible 
<A NAME="572"></A>answer!
<A NAME="573"></A><BR><BR>The fact is that those who are enslaved to their sects are not 
<A NAME="574"></A>merely devoid of all sound knowledge, but they will not even stop to learn! 
<A NAME="575"></A>Instead of listening, as they ought, to the reason why liquid can enter 
<A NAME="576"></A>the bladder through the ureters, but is unable to go back again the same 
<A NAME="577"></A>way,- instead of admiring Nature's artistic skill- they refuse to learn; 
<A NAME="578"></A>they even go so far as to scoff, and maintain that the kidneys, as well 
<A NAME="579"></A>as many other things, have been made by Nature for no purpose! And some 
<A NAME="580"></A>of them who had allowed themselves to be shown the ureters coming from 
<A NAME="581"></A>the kidneys and becoming implanted in the bladder, even had the audacity 
<A NAME="582"></A>to say that these also existed for no purpose; and others said that they 
<A NAME="583"></A>were spermatic ducts, and that this was why they were inserted into the 
<A NAME="584"></A>neck of the bladder and not into its cavity. When, therefore, we had demonstrated 
<A NAME="585"></A>to them the real spermatic ducts entering the neck of the bladder lower 
<A NAME="586"></A>down than the ureters, we supposed that, if we had not done so before, 
<A NAME="587"></A>we would now at least draw them away from their false assumptions, and 
<A NAME="588"></A>convert them forthwith to the opposite view. But even this they presumed 
<A NAME="589"></A>to dispute, and said that it was not to be wondered at that the semen should 
<A NAME="590"></A>remain longer in these latter ducts, these being more constricted, and 
<A NAME="591"></A>that it should flow quickly down the ducts which came from the kidneys, 
<A NAME="592"></A>seeing that these were well dilated. We were, therefore, further compelled 
<A NAME="593"></A>to show them in a still living animal, the urine plainly running out through 
<A NAME="594"></A>the ureters into the bladder; even thus we hardly hoped to check their 
<A NAME="595"></A>nonsensical talk.
<A NAME="596"></A><BR><BR>Now the method of demonstration is as follows. One has to divide 
<A NAME="597"></A>the peritoneum in front of the ureters, then secure these with ligatures, 
<A NAME="598"></A>and next, having bandaged up the animal, let him go (for he will not continue 
<A NAME="599"></A>to urinate). After this one loosens the external bandages and shows the 
<A NAME="600"></A>bladder empty and the ureters quite full and distended- in fact almost 
<A NAME="601"></A>on the point of rupturing; on removing the ligature from them, one then 
<A NAME="602"></A>plainly sees the bladder becoming filled with urine.
<A NAME="603"></A><BR><BR>When this has been made quite clear, then, before the animal urinates, 
<A NAME="604"></A>one has to tie a ligature round his penis and then to squeeze the bladder 
<A NAME="605"></A>all over; still nothing goes back through the ureters to the kidneys. Here, 
<A NAME="606"></A>then, it becomes obvious that not only in a dead animal, but in one which 
<A NAME="607"></A>is still living, the ureters are prevented from receiving back the urine 
<A NAME="608"></A>from the bladder. These observations having been made, one now loosens 
<A NAME="609"></A>the ligature from the animal's penis and allows him to urinate, then again 
<A NAME="610"></A>ligatures one of the ureters and leaves the other to discharge into the 
<A NAME="611"></A>bladder. Allowing, then, some time to elapse, one now demonstrates that 
<A NAME="612"></A>the ureter which was ligatured is obviously full and distended on the side 
<A NAME="613"></A>next to the kidneys, while the other one- that from which the ligature 
<A NAME="614"></A>had been taken- is itself flaccid, but has filled the bladder with urine. 
<A NAME="615"></A>Then, again, one must divide the full ureter, and demonstrate how the urine 
<A NAME="616"></A>spurts out of it, like blood in the operation of vene-section; and after 
<A NAME="617"></A>this one cuts through the other also, and both being thus divided, one 
<A NAME="618"></A>bandages up the animal externally. Then when enough time seems to have 
<A NAME="619"></A>elapsed, one takes off the bandages; the bladder will now be found empty, 
<A NAME="620"></A>and the whole region between the intestines and the peritoneum full of 
<A NAME="621"></A>urine, as if the animal were suffering from dropsy. Now, if anyone will 
<A NAME="622"></A>but test this for himself on an animal, I think he will strongly condemn 
<A NAME="623"></A>the rashness of Asclepiades, and if he also learns the reason why nothing 
<A NAME="624"></A>regurgitates from the bladder into the ureters, I think he will be persuaded 
<A NAME="625"></A>by this also of the forethought and art shown by Nature in relation to 
<A NAME="626"></A>animals.
<A NAME="627"></A><BR><BR>Now Hippocrates, who was the first known to us of all those who 
<A NAME="628"></A>have been both physicians and philosophers in as much as he was the first 
<A NAME="629"></A>to recognize what Nature effects, expresses his admiration of her, and 
<A NAME="630"></A>is constantly singing her praises and calling her "just." Alone, he says, 
<A NAME="631"></A>she suffices for the animal in every respect, performing of her own accord 
<A NAME="632"></A>and without any teaching all that is required. Being such, she has, as 
<A NAME="633"></A>he supposes, certain faculties, one attractive of what is appropriate, 
<A NAME="634"></A>and another eliminative of what is foreign, and she nourishes the animal, 
<A NAME="635"></A>makes it grow, and expels its diseases by crisis. Therefore he says that 
<A NAME="636"></A>there is in our bodies a concordance in the movements of air and fluid, 
<A NAME="637"></A>and that everything is in sympathy. According to Asclepiades, however, 
<A NAME="638"></A>nothing is naturally in sympathy with anything else, all substance being 
<A NAME="639"></A>divided and broken up into inharmonious elements and absurd "molecules." 
<A NAME="640"></A>Necessarily, then, besides making countless other statements in opposition 
<A NAME="641"></A>to plain fact, he was ignorant of Nature's faculties, both that attracting 
<A NAME="642"></A>what is appropriate, and that expelling what is foreign. Thus he invented 
<A NAME="643"></A>some wretched nonsense to explain blood-production and anadosis, and, being 
<A NAME="644"></A>utterly unable to find anything to say regarding the clearing-out of superfluities, 
<A NAME="645"></A>he did not hesitate to join issue with obvious facts, and, in this matter 
<A NAME="646"></A>of urinary secretion, to deprive both the kidneys and the ureters of their 
<A NAME="647"></A>activity, by assuming that there were certain invisible channels opening 
<A NAME="648"></A>into the bladder. It was, of course, a grand and impressive thing to do, 
<A NAME="649"></A>to mistrust the obvious, and to pin one's faith in things which could not 
<A NAME="650"></A>be seen!
<A NAME="651"></A><BR><BR>Also, in the matter of the yellow bile, he makes an even grander 
<A NAME="652"></A>and more spirited venture; for he says this is actually generated in the 
<A NAME="653"></A>bile-ducts, not merely separated out.
<A NAME="654"></A><BR><BR>How comes it, then, that in cases of jaundice two things happen 
<A NAME="655"></A>at the same time- that the dejections contain absolutely no bile, and that 
<A NAME="656"></A>the whole body becomes full of it? He is forced here again to talk nonsense, 
<A NAME="657"></A>just as he did in regard to the urine. He also talks no less nonsense about 
<A NAME="658"></A>the black bile and the spleen, not understanding what was said by Hippocrates; 
<A NAME="659"></A>and he attempts in stupid- I might say insane- language, to contradict 
<A NAME="660"></A>what he knows nothing about.
<A NAME="661"></A><BR><BR>And what profit did he derive from these opinions from the point 
<A NAME="662"></A>of view of treatment? He neither was able to cure a kidney ailment, nor 
<A NAME="663"></A>jaundice, nor a disease of black bile, nor would he agree with the view 
<A NAME="664"></A>held not merely by Hippocrates but by all men regarding drugs- that some 
<A NAME="665"></A>of them purge away yellow bile, and others black, some again phlegm, and 
<A NAME="666"></A>others the thin and watery superfluity; he held that all the substances 
<A NAME="667"></A>evacuated were produced by the drugs themselves, just as yellow bile is 
<A NAME="668"></A>produced by the biliary passages! It matters nothing, according to this 
<A NAME="669"></A>extraordinary man, whether we give a hydragogue or a cholagogue in a case 
<A NAME="670"></A>of dropsy, for these all equally purge and dissolve the body, and produce 
<A NAME="671"></A>a solution having such and such an appearance, which did not exist as such 
<A NAME="672"></A>before!
<A NAME="673"></A><BR><BR>Must we not, therefore, suppose he was either mad, or entirely 
<A NAME="674"></A>unacquainted with practical medicine? For who does not know that if a drug 
<A NAME="675"></A>for attracting phlegm be given in a case of jaundice it will not even evacuate 
<A NAME="676"></A>four cyathi of phlegm? Similarly also if one of the hydragogues be given. 
<A NAME="677"></A>A cholagogue, on the other hand, clears away a great quantity of bile, 
<A NAME="678"></A>and the skin of patients so treated at once becomes clear. I myself have, 
<A NAME="679"></A>in many cases, after treating the liver condition, then removed the disease 
<A NAME="680"></A>by means of a single purgation; whereas, if one had employed a drug for 
<A NAME="681"></A>removing phlegm one would have done no good.
<A NAME="682"></A><BR><BR>Nor is Hippocrates the only one who knows this to be so, whilst 
<A NAME="683"></A>those who take experience alone as their starting-point know otherwise; 
<A NAME="684"></A>they, as well as all physicians who are engaged in the practice of medicine, 
<A NAME="685"></A>are of this opinion. Asclepiades, however, is an exception; he would hold 
<A NAME="686"></A>it a betrayal of his assumed "elements" to confess the truth about such 
<A NAME="687"></A>matters. For if a single drug were to be discovered which attracted such 
<A NAME="688"></A>and such a humour only, there would obviously be danger of the opinion 
<A NAME="689"></A>gaining ground that there is in every body a faculty which attracts its 
<A NAME="690"></A>own particular quality. He therefore says that safflower, the Cnidian berry, 
<A NAME="691"></A>and Hippophaes, do not draw phlegm from the body, but actually make it. 
<A NAME="692"></A>Moreover, he holds that the flower and scales of bronze, and burnt bronze 
<A NAME="693"></A>itself, and germander, and wild mastich dissolve the body into water, and 
<A NAME="694"></A>that dropsical patients derive benefit from these substances, not because 
<A NAME="695"></A>they are purged by them, but because they are rid of substances which actually 
<A NAME="696"></A>help to increase the disease; for, if the medicine does not evacuate the 
<A NAME="697"></A>dropsical fluid contained in the body, but generates it, it aggravates 
<A NAME="698"></A>the condition further. Moreover, scammony, according to the Asclepiadean 
<A NAME="699"></A>argument, not only fails to evacuate the bile from the bodies of jaundiced 
<A NAME="700"></A>subjects, but actually turns the useful blood into bile, and dissolves 
<A NAME="701"></A>the body; in fact it does all manner of evil and increases the 
<A NAME="702"></A>disease.
<A NAME="703"></A><BR><BR>And yet this drug may be clearly seen to do good to numbers of 
<A NAME="704"></A>people! "Yes," says he, "they derive benefit certainly, but merely in proportion 
<A NAME="705"></A>to the evacuation."... But if you give these cases a drug which draws off 
<A NAME="706"></A>phlegm they will not be benefited. This is so obvious that even those who 
<A NAME="707"></A>make experience alone their starting-point are aware of it; and these people 
<A NAME="708"></A>make it a cardinal point of their teaching to trust to no arguments, but 
<A NAME="709"></A>only to what can be clearly seen. In this, then, they show good sense; 
<A NAME="710"></A>whereas Asclepiades goes far astray in bidding us distrust our senses where 
<A NAME="711"></A>obvious facts plainly overturn his hypotheses. Much better would it have 
<A NAME="712"></A>been for him not to assail obvious facts, but rather to devote himself 
<A NAME="713"></A>entirely to these.
<A NAME="714"></A><BR><BR>Is it, then, these facts only which are plainly irreconcilable 
<A NAME="715"></A>with the views of Asclepiades? Is not also the fact that in summer yellow 
<A NAME="716"></A>bile is evacuated in greater quantity by the same drugs, and in winter 
<A NAME="717"></A>phlegm, and that in a young man more bile is evacuated, and in an old man 
<A NAME="718"></A>more phlegm? Obviously each drug attracts something which already exists, 
<A NAME="719"></A>and does not generate something previously non-existent. Thus if you give 
<A NAME="720"></A>in the summer season a drug which attracts phlegm to a young man of a lean 
<A NAME="721"></A>and warm habit, who has lived neither idly nor too luxuriously, you will 
<A NAME="722"></A>with great difficulty evacuate a very small quantity of this humour, and 
<A NAME="723"></A>you will do the man the utmost harm. On the other hand, if you give him 
<A NAME="724"></A>a cholagogue, you will produce an abundant evacuation and not injure him 
<A NAME="725"></A>at all.
<A NAME="726"></A><BR><BR>Do we still, then, disbelieve that each drug attracts that humour 
<A NAME="727"></A>which is proper to it? Possibly the adherents of Asclepiades will assent 
<A NAME="728"></A>to this- or rather, they will- not possibly, but certainly- declare that 
<A NAME="729"></A>they disbelieve it, lest they should betray their darling 
<A NAME="730"></A>prejudices.
<A NAME="731"></A><BR><BR>14. Let us pass on, then, again to another piece of nonsense; for 
<A NAME="732"></A>the sophists do not allow one to engage in enquiries that are of any worth, 
<A NAME="733"></A>albeit there are many such; they compel one to spend one's time in dissipating 
<A NAME="734"></A>the fallacious arguments which they bring forward.
<A NAME="735"></A><BR><BR>What, then, is this piece of nonsense? It has to do with the famous 
<A NAME="736"></A>and far-renowned stone which draws iron [the lodestone]. It might be thought 
<A NAME="737"></A>that this would draw their minds to a belief that there are in all bodies 
<A NAME="738"></A>certain faculties by which they attract their own proper 
<A NAME="739"></A>qualities.
<A NAME="740"></A><BR><BR>Now Epicurus, despite the fact that he employs in his "Physics" 
<A NAME="741"></A>elements similar to those of Asclepiades, yet allows that iron is attracted 
<A NAME="742"></A>by the lodestone, and chaff by amber. He even tries to give the cause of 
<A NAME="743"></A>the phenomenon. His view is that the atoms which flow from the stone are 
<A NAME="744"></A>related in shape to those flowing from the iron, and so they become easily 
<A NAME="745"></A>interlocked with one another; thus it is that, after colliding with each 
<A NAME="746"></A>of the two compact masses (the stone and the iron) they then rebound into 
<A NAME="747"></A>the middle and so become entangled with each other, and draw the iron after 
<A NAME="748"></A>them. So far, then, as his hypotheses regarding causation go, he is perfectly 
<A NAME="749"></A>unconvincing; nevertheless, he does grant that there is an attraction. 
<A NAME="750"></A>Further, he says that it is on similar principles that there occur in the 
<A NAME="751"></A>bodies of animals the dispersal of nutriment and the discharge of waste 
<A NAME="752"></A>matters, as also the actions of cathartic drugs.
<A NAME="753"></A><BR><BR>Asclepiades, however, who viewed with suspicion the incredible 
<A NAME="754"></A>character of the cause mentioned, and who saw no other credible cause on 
<A NAME="755"></A>the basis of his supposed elements, shamelessly had recourse to the statement 
<A NAME="756"></A>that nothing is in any way attracted by anything else. Now, if he was dissatisfied 
<A NAME="757"></A>with what Epicurus said, and had nothing better to say himself, he ought 
<A NAME="758"></A>to have refrained from making hypotheses, and should have said that Nature 
<A NAME="759"></A>is a constructive artist and that the substance of things is always tending 
<A NAME="760"></A>towards unity and also towards alteration because its own parts act upon 
<A NAME="761"></A>and are acted upon by one another. For, if he had assumed this, it would 
<A NAME="762"></A>not have been difficult to allow that this constructive Nature has powers 
<A NAME="763"></A>which attract appropriate and expel alien matter. For in no other way could 
<A NAME="764"></A>she be constructive, preservative of the animal, and eliminative of its 
<A NAME="765"></A>diseases, unless it be allowed that she conserves what is appropriate and 
<A NAME="766"></A>discharges what is foreign.
<A NAME="767"></A><BR><BR>But in this matter, too, Asclepiades realized the logical sequence 
<A NAME="768"></A>of the principles he had assumed; he showed no scruples, however, in opposing 
<A NAME="769"></A>plain fact; he joins issue in this matter also, not merely with all physicians, 
<A NAME="770"></A>but with everyone else, and maintains that there is no such thing as a 
<A NAME="771"></A>crisis, or critical day, and that Nature does absolutely nothing for the 
<A NAME="772"></A>preservation of the animal. For his constant aim is to follow out logical 
<A NAME="773"></A>consequences and to upset obvious fact, in this respect being opposed to 
<A NAME="774"></A>Epicurus; for the latter always stated the observed fact, although he gives 
<A NAME="775"></A>an ineffective explanation of it. For, that these small corpuscles belonging 
<A NAME="776"></A>to the lodestone rebound, and become entangled with other similar particles 
<A NAME="777"></A>of the iron, and that then, by means of this entanglement (which cannot 
<A NAME="778"></A>be seen anywhere) such a heavy substance as iron is attracted- I fail to 
<A NAME="779"></A>understand how anybody could believe this. Even if we admit this, the same 
<A NAME="780"></A>principle will not explain the fact that, when the iron has another piece 
<A NAME="781"></A>brought in contact with it, this becomes attached to 
<A NAME="782"></A>it.
<A NAME="783"></A><BR><BR>For what are we to say? That, forsooth, some of the particles that 
<A NAME="784"></A>flow from the lodestone collide with the iron and then rebound back, and 
<A NAME="785"></A>that it is by these that the iron becomes suspended? that others penetrate 
<A NAME="786"></A>into it, and rapidly pass through it by way of its empty channels? that 
<A NAME="787"></A>these then collide with the second piece of iron and are not able to penetrate 
<A NAME="788"></A>it although they penetrated the first piece? and that they then course 
<A NAME="789"></A>back to the first piece, and produce entanglements like the former 
<A NAME="790"></A>ones?
<A NAME="791"></A><BR><BR>The hypothesis here becomes clearly refuted by its absurdity. As 
<A NAME="792"></A>a matter of fact, I have seen five writing-stylets of iron attached to 
<A NAME="793"></A>one another in a line, only the first one being in contact with the lodestone, 
<A NAME="794"></A>and the power being transmitted through it to the others. Moreover, it 
<A NAME="795"></A>cannot be said that if you bring a second stylet into contact with the 
<A NAME="796"></A>lower end of the first, it becomes held, attached, and suspended, whereas, 
<A NAME="797"></A>if you apply it to any other part of the side it does not become attached. 
<A NAME="798"></A>For the power of the lodestone is distributed in all directions; it merely 
<A NAME="799"></A>needs to be in contact with the first stylet at any point; from this stylet 
<A NAME="800"></A>again the power flows, as quick as a thought, all through the second, and 
<A NAME="801"></A>from that again to the third. Now, if you imagine a small lodestone hanging 
<A NAME="802"></A>in a house, and in contact with it all round a large number of pieces of 
<A NAME="803"></A>iron, from them again others, from these others, and so on,- all these 
<A NAME="804"></A>pieces of iron must surely become filled with the corpuscles which emanate 
<A NAME="805"></A>from the stone; therefore, this first little stone is likely to become 
<A NAME="806"></A>dissipated by disintegrating into these emanations. Further, even if there 
<A NAME="807"></A>be no iron in contact with it, it still disperses into the air, particularly 
<A NAME="808"></A>if this be also warm.
<A NAME="809"></A><BR><BR>"Yes," says Epicurus, "but these corpuscles must be looked on as 
<A NAME="810"></A>exceedingly small, so that some of them are a ten-thousandth part of the 
<A NAME="811"></A>size of the very smallest particles carried in the air." Then do you venture 
<A NAME="812"></A>to say that so great a weight of iron can be suspended by such small bodies? 
<A NAME="813"></A>If each of them is a ten-thousandth part as large as the dust particles 
<A NAME="814"></A>which are borne in the atmosphere, how big must we suppose the hook-like 
<A NAME="815"></A>extremities by which they interlock with each other to be? For of course 
<A NAME="816"></A>this is quite the smallest portion of the whole particle.
<A NAME="817"></A><BR><BR>Then, again, when a small body becomes entangled with another small 
<A NAME="818"></A>body, or when a body in motion becomes entangled with another also in motion, 
<A NAME="819"></A>they do not rebound at once. For, further, there will of course be others 
<A NAME="820"></A>which break in upon them from above, from below, from front and rear, from 
<A NAME="821"></A>right and left, and which shake and agitate them and never let them rest. 
<A NAME="822"></A>Moreover, we must perforce suppose that each of these small bodies has 
<A NAME="823"></A>a large number of these hook-like extremities. For by one it attaches itself 
<A NAME="824"></A>to its neighbours, by another- the topmost one- to the lodestone, and by 
<A NAME="825"></A>the bottom one to the iron. For if it were attached to the stone above 
<A NAME="826"></A>and not interlocked with the iron below, this would be of no use. Thus, 
<A NAME="827"></A>the upper part of the superior extremity must hang from the lodestone, 
<A NAME="828"></A>and the iron must be attached to the lower end of the inferior extremity; 
<A NAME="829"></A>and, since they interlock with each other by their sides as well, they 
<A NAME="830"></A>must, of course, have hooks there too. Keep in mind also, above everything, 
<A NAME="831"></A>what small bodies these are which possess all these different kinds of 
<A NAME="832"></A>outgrowths. Still more, remember how, in order that the second piece of 
<A NAME="833"></A>iron may become attached to the first, the third to the second, and to 
<A NAME="834"></A>that the fourth, these absurd little particles must both penetrate the 
<A NAME="835"></A>passages in the first piece of iron and at the same time rebound from the 
<A NAME="836"></A>piece coming next in the series, although this second piece is naturally 
<A NAME="837"></A>in every way similar to the first.
<A NAME="838"></A><BR><BR>Such an hypothesis, once again, is certainly not lacking in audacity; 
<A NAME="839"></A>in fact, to tell the truth, it is far more shameless than the previous 
<A NAME="840"></A>ones; according to it, when five similar pieces of iron are arranged in 
<A NAME="841"></A>a line, the particles of the lodestone which easily traverse the first 
<A NAME="842"></A>piece of iron rebound from the second, and do not pass readily through 
<A NAME="843"></A>it in the same way. Indeed, it is nonsense, whichever alternative is adopted. 
<A NAME="844"></A>For, if they do rebound, how then do they pass through into the third piece? 
<A NAME="845"></A>And if they do not rebound, how does the second piece become suspended 
<A NAME="846"></A>to the first? For Epicurus himself looked on the rebound as the active 
<A NAME="847"></A>agent in attraction.
<A NAME="848"></A><BR><BR>But, as I have said, one is driven to talk nonsense whenever one 
<A NAME="849"></A>gets into discussion with such men. Having, therefore, given a concise 
<A NAME="850"></A>and summary statement of the matter, I wish to be done with it. For if 
<A NAME="851"></A>one diligently familiarizes oneself with the writings of Asclepiades, one 
<A NAME="852"></A>will see clearly their logical dependence on his first principles, but 
<A NAME="853"></A>also their disagreement with observed facts. Thus, Epicurus, in his desire 
<A NAME="854"></A>to adhere to the facts, cuts an awkward figure by aspiring to show that 
<A NAME="855"></A>these agree with his principles, whereas Asclepiades safeguards the sequence 
<A NAME="856"></A>of principles, but pays no attention to the obvious fact. Whoever, therefore, 
<A NAME="857"></A>wishes to expose the absurdity of their hypotheses, must, if the argument 
<A NAME="858"></A>be in answer to Asclepiades, keep in mind his disagreement with observed 
<A NAME="859"></A>fact; or if in answer to Epicurus, his discordance with his principles. 
<A NAME="860"></A>Almost all the other sects depending on similar principles are now entirely 
<A NAME="861"></A>extinct, while these alone maintain a respectable existence still. Yet 
<A NAME="862"></A>the tenets of Asclepiades have been unanswerably confuted by Menodotus 
<A NAME="863"></A>the Empiricist, who draws his attention to their opposition to phenomena 
<A NAME="864"></A>and to each other; and, again, those of Epicurus have been confuted by 
<A NAME="865"></A>Asclepiades, who adhered always to logical sequence, about which Epicurus 
<A NAME="866"></A>evidently cares little.
<A NAME="867"></A><BR><BR>Now people of the present day do not begin by getting a clear comprehension 
<A NAME="868"></A>of these sects, as well as of the better ones, thereafter devoting a long 
<A NAME="869"></A>time to judging and testing the true and false in each of them; despite 
<A NAME="870"></A>their ignorance, they style themselves, some "physicians" and others "philosophers." 
<A NAME="871"></A>No wonder, then, that they honour the false equally with the true. For 
<A NAME="872"></A>everyone becomes like the first teacher that he comes across, without waiting 
<A NAME="873"></A>to learn anything from anybody else. And there are some of them, who, even 
<A NAME="874"></A>if they meet with more than one teacher, are yet so unintelligent and slow-witted 
<A NAME="875"></A>that even by the time they have reached old age they are still incapable 
<A NAME="876"></A>of understanding the steps of an argument.... In the old days such people 
<A NAME="877"></A>used to be set to menial tasks.... What will be the end of it God 
<A NAME="878"></A>knows!
<A NAME="879"></A><BR><BR>Now, we usually refrain from arguing with people whose principles 
<A NAME="880"></A>are wrong from the outset. Still, having been compelled by the natural 
<A NAME="881"></A>course of events to enter into some kind of a discussion with them, we 
<A NAME="882"></A>must add this further to what was said- that it is not only cathartic drugs 
<A NAME="883"></A>which naturally attract their special qualities, but also those which remove 
<A NAME="884"></A>thorns and the points of arrows such as sometimes become deeply embedded 
<A NAME="885"></A>in the flesh. Those drugs also which draw out animal poisons or poisons 
<A NAME="886"></A>applied to arrows all show the same faculty as does the lodestone. Thus, 
<A NAME="887"></A>I myself have seen a thorn which was embedded in a young man's foot fail 
<A NAME="888"></A>to come out when we exerted forcible traction with our fingers, and yet 
<A NAME="889"></A>come away painlessly and rapidly on the application of a medicament. Yet 
<A NAME="890"></A>even to this some people will object, asserting that when the inflammation 
<A NAME="891"></A>is dispersed from the part the thorn comes away of itself, without being 
<A NAME="892"></A>pulled out by anything. But these people seem, in the first place, to be 
<A NAME="893"></A>unaware that there are certain drugs for drawing out inflammation and different 
<A NAME="894"></A>ones for drawing out embedded substances; and surely if it was on the cessation 
<A NAME="895"></A>of an inflammation that the abnormal matters were expelled, then all drugs 
<A NAME="896"></A>which disperse inflammations ought ipso facto; to possess the power of 
<A NAME="897"></A>extracting these substances as well.
<A NAME="898"></A><BR><BR>And secondly, these people seem to be unaware of a still more surprising 
<A NAME="899"></A>fact, namely, that not merely do certain medicaments draw out thorns and 
<A NAME="900"></A>others poisons, but that of the latter there are some which attract the 
<A NAME="901"></A>poison of the viper, others that of the sting-ray, and others that of some 
<A NAME="902"></A>other animal; we can, in fact, plainly observe these poisons deposited 
<A NAME="903"></A>on the medicaments. Here, then, we must praise Epicurus for the respect 
<A NAME="904"></A>he shows towards obvious facts, but find fault with his views as to causation. 
<A NAME="905"></A>For how can it be otherwise than extremely foolish to suppose that a thorn 
<A NAME="906"></A>which we failed to remove by digital traction could be drawn out by these 
<A NAME="907"></A>minute particles?
<A NAME="908"></A><BR><BR>Have we now, therefore, convinced ourselves that everything which 
<A NAME="909"></A>exists possesses a faculty by which it attracts its proper quality, and 
<A NAME="910"></A>that some things do this more, and some less?
<A NAME="911"></A><BR><BR>Or shall we also furnish our argument with the illustration afforded 
<A NAME="912"></A>by corn? For those who refuse to admit that anything is attracted by anything 
<A NAME="913"></A>else, will, I imagine, be here proved more ignorant regarding Nature than 
<A NAME="914"></A>the very peasants. When, for my own part, I first learned of what happens, 
<A NAME="915"></A>I was surprised, and felt anxious to see it with my own eyes. Afterwards, 
<A NAME="916"></A>when experience also had confirmed its truth, I sought long among the various 
<A NAME="917"></A>sects for an explanation, and, with the exception of that which gave the 
<A NAME="918"></A>first place to attraction, I could find none which even approached plausibility, 
<A NAME="919"></A>all the others being ridiculous and obviously quite 
<A NAME="920"></A>untenable.
<A NAME="921"></A><BR><BR>What happens, then, is the following. When our peasants are bringing 
<A NAME="922"></A>corn from the country into the city in wagons, and wish to filch some away 
<A NAME="923"></A>without being detected, they fill earthen jars with water and stand them 
<A NAME="924"></A>among the corn; the corn then draws the moisture into itself through the 
<A NAME="925"></A>jar and acquires additional bulk and weight, but the fact is never detected 
<A NAME="926"></A>by the onlookers unless someone who knew about the trick before makes a 
<A NAME="927"></A>more careful inspection. Yet, if you care to set down the same vessel in 
<A NAME="928"></A>the very hot sun, you will find the daily loss to be very little indeed. 
<A NAME="929"></A>Thus corn has a greater power than extreme solar heat of drawing to itself 
<A NAME="930"></A>the moisture in its neighbourhood. Thus the theory that the water is carried 
<A NAME="931"></A>towards the rarefied part of the air surrounding us (particularly when 
<A NAME="932"></A>that is distinctly warm) is utter nonsense; for although it is much more 
<A NAME="933"></A>rarefied there than it is amongst the corn, yet it does not take up a tenth 
<A NAME="934"></A>part of the moisture which the corn does.
<A NAME="935"></A><BR><BR>15. Since, then, we have talked sufficient nonsense- not willingly, 
<A NAME="936"></A>but because we were forced, as the proverb says, "to behave madly among 
<A NAME="937"></A>madmen"- let us return again to the subject of urinary secretion. Here 
<A NAME="938"></A>let us forget the absurdities of Asclepiades, and, in company with those 
<A NAME="939"></A>who are persuaded that the urine does pass through the kidneys, let us 
<A NAME="940"></A>consider what is the character of this function. For, most assuredly, either 
<A NAME="941"></A>the urine is conveyed by its own motion to the kidneys, considering this 
<A NAME="942"></A>the better course (as do we when we go off to market!), or, if this be 
<A NAME="943"></A>impossible, then some other reason for its conveyance must be found. What, 
<A NAME="944"></A>then, is this? If we are not going to grant the kidneys a faculty for attracting 
<A NAME="945"></A>this particular quality, as Hippocrates held, we shall discover no other 
<A NAME="946"></A>reason. For, surely everyone sees that either the kidneys must attract 
<A NAME="947"></A>the urine, or the veins must propel it- if, that is, it does not move of 
<A NAME="948"></A>itself. But if the veins did exert a propulsive action when they contract, 
<A NAME="949"></A>they would squeeze out into the kidneys not merely the urine, but along 
<A NAME="950"></A>with it the whole of the blood which they contain. And if this is impossible, 
<A NAME="951"></A>as we shall show, the remaining explanation is that the kidneys do exert 
<A NAME="952"></A>traction.
<A NAME="953"></A><BR><BR>And how is propulsion by the veins impossible? The situation of 
<A NAME="954"></A>the kidneys is against it. They do not occupy a position beneath the hollow 
<A NAME="955"></A>vein [vena cava] as does the sieve-like [ethmoid] passage in the nose and 
<A NAME="956"></A>palate in relation to the surplus matter from the brain; they are situated 
<A NAME="957"></A>on both sides of it. Besides, if the kidneys are like sieves, and readily 
<A NAME="958"></A>let the thinner serous [whey-like] portion through, and keep out the thicker 
<A NAME="959"></A>portion, then the whole of the blood contained in the vena cava must go 
<A NAME="960"></A>to them, just as the whole of the wine is thrown into the filters. Further, 
<A NAME="961"></A>the example of milk being made into cheese will show clearly what I mean. 
<A NAME="962"></A>For this, too, although it is all thrown into the wicker strainers, does 
<A NAME="963"></A>not all percolate through; such part of it as is too fine in proportion 
<A NAME="964"></A>to the width of the meshes passes downwards, and this is called whey [serum]; 
<A NAME="965"></A>the remaining thick portion which is destined to become cheese cannot get 
<A NAME="966"></A>down, since the pores of the strainers will not admit it. Thus it is that, 
<A NAME="967"></A>if the blood-serum has similarly to percolate through the kidneys, the 
<A NAME="968"></A>whole of the blood must come to them, and not merely one part of 
<A NAME="969"></A>it.
<A NAME="970"></A><BR><BR>What, then, is the appearance as found on dissection?
<A NAME="971"></A><BR>One division of the vena cava is carried upwards to the heart, and 
<A NAME="972"></A>the other mounts upon the spine and extends along its whole length as far 
<A NAME="973"></A>as the legs; thus one division does not even come near the kidneys, while 
<A NAME="974"></A>the other approaches them but is certainly not inserted into them. Now, 
<A NAME="975"></A>if the blood were destined to be purified by them as if they were sieves, 
<A NAME="976"></A>the whole of it would have to fall into them, the thin part being and the 
<A NAME="977"></A>thick part retained above. But, as a matter of fact, this is not so. For 
<A NAME="978"></A>the kidneys lie on either side of the vena cava. They therefore do not 
<A NAME="979"></A>act like sieves, filtering fluid sent to them by the vena cava, and themselves 
<A NAME="980"></A>contributing no force. They obviously exert traction; for this is the only 
<A NAME="981"></A>remaining alternative.
<A NAME="982"></A><BR><BR>How, then, do they exert this traction? If, as Epicurus thinks, 
<A NAME="983"></A>all attraction takes place by virtue of the rebounds and entanglements 
<A NAME="984"></A>of atoms, it would be certainly better to maintain that the kidneys have 
<A NAME="985"></A>no attractive action at all; for his theory, when examined, would be found 
<A NAME="986"></A>as it stands to be much more ridiculous even than the theory of the lodestone, 
<A NAME="987"></A>mentioned a little while ago. Attraction occurs in the way that Hippocrates 
<A NAME="988"></A>laid down; this will be stated more clearly as the discussion proceeds; 
<A NAME="989"></A>for the present our task is not to demonstrate this, but to point out that 
<A NAME="990"></A>no other cause of the secretion of urine can be given except that of attraction 
<A NAME="991"></A>by the kidneys, and that this attraction does not take place in the way 
<A NAME="992"></A>imagined by people who do not allow Nature a faculty of her 
<A NAME="993"></A>own.
<A NAME="994"></A><BR><BR>For if it be granted that there is any attractive faculty at all 
<A NAME="995"></A>in those things which are governed by Nature, a person who attempted to 
<A NAME="996"></A>say anything else about the absorption of nutriment would be considered 
<A NAME="997"></A>a fool.
<A NAME="998"></A><BR><BR>16. Now, while Erasistratus for some reason replied at great length 
<A NAME="999"></A>to certain other foolish doctrines, he entirely passed over the view held 
<A NAME="1000"></A>by Hippocrates, not even thinking it worth while to mention it, as he did 
<A NAME="1001"></A>in his work "On Deglutition"; in that work, as may be seen, he did go so 
<A NAME="1002"></A>far as at least to make mention of the word attraction, writing somewhat 
<A NAME="1003"></A>as follows:
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR><BR>"Now, the stomach does not appear to exercise any attraction." 
<A NAME="1005"></A>But when he is dealing with anadosis he does not mention the Hippocratic 
<A NAME="1006"></A>view even to the extent of a single syllable. Yet we should have been satisfied 
<A NAME="1007"></A>if he had even merely written this: "Hippocrates lies in saying 'The flesh 
<A NAME="1008"></A>attracts both from the stomach and from without,' for it cannot attract 
<A NAME="1009"></A>either from the stomach or from without." Or if he had thought it worth 
<A NAME="1010"></A>while to state that Hippocrates was wrong in criticizing the weakness of 
<A NAME="1011"></A>the neck of the uterus, "seeing that the orifice of the uterus has no power 
<A NAME="1012"></A>of attracting semen," or if he [Erasistratus] had thought proper to write 
<A NAME="1013"></A>any other similar opinion, then we in our turn would have defended ourselves 
<A NAME="1014"></A>in the following terms:
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR><BR>"My good sir, do not run us down in this rhetorical fashion without 
<A NAME="1016"></A>some proof; state some definite objection to our view, in order that either 
<A NAME="1017"></A>you may convince us by a brilliant refutation of the ancient doctrine, 
<A NAME="1018"></A>or that, on the other hand, we may convert you from your ignorance." Yet 
<A NAME="1019"></A>why do I say "rhetorical"? For we too are not to suppose that when certain 
<A NAME="1020"></A>rhetoricians pour ridicule upon that which they are quite incapable of 
<A NAME="1021"></A>refuting, without any attempt at argument, their words are really thereby 
<A NAME="1022"></A>constituted rhetoric. For rhetoric proceeds by persuasive reasoning; words 
<A NAME="1023"></A>without reasoning are buffoonery rather than rhetoric. Therefore, the reply 
<A NAME="1024"></A>of Erasistratus in his treatise "On Deglutition" was neither rhetoric nor 
<A NAME="1025"></A>logic. For what is it that he says? "Now, the stomach does not appear to 
<A NAME="1026"></A>exercise any traction." Let us testify against him in return, and set our 
<A NAME="1027"></A>argument beside his in the same form. Now, there appears to be no peristalsis 
<A NAME="1028"></A>of the gullet. "And how does this appear?" one of his adherents may perchance 
<A NAME="1029"></A>ask. "For is it not indicative of peristalsis that always when the upper 
<A NAME="1030"></A>parts of the gullet contract the lower parts dilate?" Again, then, we say, 
<A NAME="1031"></A>"And in what way does the attraction of the stomach not appear? For is 
<A NAME="1032"></A>it not indicative of attraction that always when the lower parts of the 
<A NAME="1033"></A>gullet dilate the upper parts contract?" Now, if he would but be sensible 
<A NAME="1034"></A>and recognize that this phenomenon is not more indicative of the one than 
<A NAME="1035"></A>of the other view, but that it applies equally to both, we should then 
<A NAME="1036"></A>show him without further delay the proper way to the discovery of 
<A NAME="1037"></A>truth.
<A NAME="1038"></A><BR><BR>We will, however, speak about the stomach again. And the dispersal 
<A NAME="1039"></A>of nutriment [anadosis] need not make us have recourse to the theory regarding 
<A NAME="1040"></A>the natural tendency of a vacuum to become refilled, when once we have 
<A NAME="1041"></A>granted the attractive faculty of the kidneys. Now, although Erasistratus 
<A NAME="1042"></A>knew that this faculty most certainly existed, he neither mentioned it 
<A NAME="1043"></A>nor denied it, nor did he make any statement as to his views on the secretion 
<A NAME="1044"></A>of urine.
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR><BR>Why did he give notice at the very beginning of his "General Principles" 
<A NAME="1046"></A>that he was going to speak about natural activities- firstly what they 
<A NAME="1047"></A>are, how they take place, and in what situations- and then, in the case 
<A NAME="1048"></A>of urinary secretion, declared that this took place through the kidneys, 
<A NAME="1049"></A>but left out its method of occurrence? It must, then, have been for no 
<A NAME="1050"></A>purpose that he told us how digestion occurs, or spends time upon the secretion 
<A NAME="1051"></A>of biliary superfluities; for in these cases also it would have been sufficient 
<A NAME="1052"></A>to have named the parts through which the function takes place, and to 
<A NAME="1053"></A>have omitted the method. On the contrary, in these cases he was able to 
<A NAME="1054"></A>tell us not merely through what organs, but also in what way it occurs- 
<A NAME="1055"></A>as he also did, I think, in the case of anadosis; for he was not satisfied 
<A NAME="1056"></A>with saying that this took place through the veins, but he also considered 
<A NAME="1057"></A>fully the method, which he held to be from the tendency of a vacuum to 
<A NAME="1058"></A>become refilled. Concerning the secretion of urine, however, he writes 
<A NAME="1059"></A>that this occurs through the kidneys, but does not add in what way it occurs. 
<A NAME="1060"></A>I do not think he could say that this was from the tendency of matter to 
<A NAME="1061"></A>fill a vacuum, for, if this were so, nobody would have ever died of retention 
<A NAME="1062"></A>of urine, since no more can flow into a vacuum than has run out. For, if 
<A NAME="1063"></A>no other factor comes into operation save only this tendency by which a 
<A NAME="1064"></A>vacuum becomes refilled, no more could ever flow in than had been evacuated. 
<A NAME="1065"></A>Nor, could he suggest any other plausible cause, such, for example, as 
<A NAME="1066"></A>the of nutriment by the stomach which occurs in the process of anadosis; 
<A NAME="1067"></A>this had been entirely disproved in the case of blood in the vena cava; 
<A NAME="1068"></A>it is excluded, not merely owing to the long distance, but also from the 
<A NAME="1069"></A>fact that the overlying heart, at each diastole, robs the vena cava by 
<A NAME="1070"></A>violence of a considerable quantity of blood.
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR><BR>In relation to the lower part of the vena cava there would still 
<A NAME="1072"></A>remain, solitary and abandoned, the specious theory concerning the filling 
<A NAME="1073"></A>of a vacuum. This, however, is deprived of plausibility by the fact that 
<A NAME="1074"></A>people die of retention of urine, and also, no less, by the situation of 
<A NAME="1075"></A>the kidneys. For, if the whole of the blood were carried to the kidneys, 
<A NAME="1076"></A>one might properly maintain that it all undergoes purification there. But, 
<A NAME="1077"></A>as a matter of fact, the whole of it does not go to them, but only so much 
<A NAME="1078"></A>as can be contained in the veins going to the kidneys; this portion only, 
<A NAME="1079"></A>therefore, will be purified. Further, the thin serous part of this will 
<A NAME="1080"></A>pass through the kidneys as if through a sieve, while the thick sanguineous 
<A NAME="1081"></A>portion remaining in the veins will obstruct the blood flowing in from 
<A NAME="1082"></A>behind; this will first, therefore, have to run back to the vena cava, 
<A NAME="1083"></A>and so to empty the veins going to the kidneys; these veins will no longer 
<A NAME="1084"></A>be able to conduct a second quantity of unpurified blood to the kidneys- 
<A NAME="1085"></A>occupied as they are by the blood which had preceded, there is no passage 
<A NAME="1086"></A>left. What power have we, then, which will draw back the purified blood 
<A NAME="1087"></A>from the kidneys? And what power,in the next place, will bid this blood 
<A NAME="1088"></A>retire to the lower part of the vena cava, and will enjoin on another quantity 
<A NAME="1089"></A>coming from above not to proceed downwards before turning off into the 
<A NAME="1090"></A>kidneys?
<A NAME="1091"></A><BR><BR>Now Erasistratus realized that all these ideas were open to many 
<A NAME="1092"></A>objections, and he could only find one idea which held good in all respects- 
<A NAME="1093"></A>namely, that of attraction. Since, therefore, he did not wish either to 
<A NAME="1094"></A>get into difficulties or to mention the view of Hippocrates, he deemed 
<A NAME="1095"></A>it better to say nothing at all as to the manner in which secretion 
<A NAME="1096"></A>occurs.
<A NAME="1097"></A><BR><BR>But even if he kept silence, I am not going to do so. For I know 
<A NAME="1098"></A>that if one passes over the Hippocratic view and makes some other pronouncement 
<A NAME="1099"></A>about the function of the kidneys, one cannot fall to make oneself utterly 
<A NAME="1100"></A>ridiculous. It was for this reason that Erasistratus kept silence and Asclepiades 
<A NAME="1101"></A>lied; they are li
