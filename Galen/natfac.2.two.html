<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>1. In the previous book we demonstrated that not only Erasistratus, but 
<A NAME="11"></A>also all others who would say anything to the purpose about urinary secretion, 
<A NAME="12"></A>must acknowledge that the kidneys possess some faculty which attracts to 
<A NAME="13"></A>them this particular quality existing in the urine. Besides this we drew 
<A NAME="14"></A>attention to the fact that the urine is not carried through the kidneys 
<A NAME="15"></A>into the bladder by one method, the blood into parts of the animal by another, 
<A NAME="16"></A>and the yellow bile separated out on yet another principle. For when once 
<A NAME="17"></A>there has been demonstrated in any one organ, the drawing, or so-called 
<A NAME="18"></A>epispastic faculty, there is then no difficulty in transferring it to the 
<A NAME="19"></A>rest. Certainly Nature did not give a power such as this to the kidneys 
<A NAME="20"></A>without giving it also to the vessels which abstract the biliary fluid, 
<A NAME="21"></A>nor did she give it to the latter without also it to each of the other 
<A NAME="22"></A>parts. And, assuredly, if this is true, we must marvel that Erasistratus 
<A NAME="23"></A>should make statements concerning the delivery of nutriment from the food-canal 
<A NAME="24"></A>which are so false as to be detected even by Asclepiades. Now, Erasistratus 
<A NAME="25"></A>considers it absolutely certain that, if anything flows from the veins, 
<A NAME="26"></A>one of two things must happen: either a completely empty space will result, 
<A NAME="27"></A>or the contiguous quantum of fluid will run in and take the place of that 
<A NAME="28"></A>which has been evacuated. Asclepiades, however, holds that not one of two, 
<A NAME="29"></A>but one of three things must be said to result in the emptied vessels: 
<A NAME="30"></A>either there will be an entirely empty space, or the contiguous portion 
<A NAME="31"></A>will flow in, or the vessel will contract. For whereas, in the case of 
<A NAME="32"></A>reeds and tubes it is true to say that, if these be submerged in water, 
<A NAME="33"></A>and are emptied of the air which they contain in their lumens, then either 
<A NAME="34"></A>a completely empty space will be left, or the contiguous portion will move 
<A NAME="35"></A>onwards; in the case of veins this no longer holds, since their coats can 
<A NAME="36"></A>collapse and so fall in upon the interior cavity. It may be seen, then, 
<A NAME="37"></A>how false this hypothesis- by Zeus, I cannot call it a demonstration!- 
<A NAME="38"></A>of Erasistratus is.
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR>And, from another point of view, even if it were true, it is superfluous, 
<A NAME="40"></A>if the stomach has the power of compressing the veins, as he himself supposed, 
<A NAME="41"></A>and the veins again of contracting upon their contents and propelling them 
<A NAME="42"></A>forwards. For, apart from other considerations, no plethora would ever 
<A NAME="43"></A>take place in the body, if delivery of nutriment resulted merely from the 
<A NAME="44"></A>tendency of a vacuum to become refilled. Now, if the compression of the 
<A NAME="45"></A>stomach becomes weaker the further it goes, and cannot reach to an indefinite 
<A NAME="46"></A>distance, and if, therefore, there is need of some other mechanism to explain 
<A NAME="47"></A>why the blood is conveyed in all directions, then the principle of the 
<A NAME="48"></A>refilling of a vacuum may be looked on as a necessary addition; there will 
<A NAME="49"></A>not, however, be a plethora in any of the parts coming after the liver, 
<A NAME="50"></A>or, if there be, it will be in the region of the heart and lungs; for the 
<A NAME="51"></A>heart alone of the parts which come after the liver draws the nutriment 
<A NAME="52"></A>into its right ventricle, thereafter sending it through the arterioid vein 
<A NAME="53"></A>to the lungs (for Erasistratus himself will have it that, owing to the 
<A NAME="54"></A>membranous excrescences, no other parts save the lungs receive nourishment 
<A NAME="55"></A>from the heart). If, however, in order to explain how plethora comes about, 
<A NAME="56"></A>we suppose the force of compression by the stomach to persist indefinitely, 
<A NAME="57"></A>we have no further need of the principle of the refilling of a vacuum, 
<A NAME="58"></A>especially if we assume contraction of the veins in addition- as is, again, 
<A NAME="59"></A>agreeable to Erasistratus himself.
<A NAME="60"></A><BR><BR>2. Let me draw his attention, then, once again, even if he does 
<A NAME="61"></A>not wish it, to the kidneys, and let me state that these confute in the 
<A NAME="62"></A>very clearest manner such people as object to the principle of attraction. 
<A NAME="63"></A>Nobody has ever said anything plausible, nor, as we previously showed, 
<A NAME="64"></A>has anyone been able to discover, by any means, any other cause for the 
<A NAME="65"></A>secretion of urine; we necessarily appear mad if we maintain that the urine 
<A NAME="66"></A>passes into the kidneys in the form of vapour, and we certainly cut a poor 
<A NAME="67"></A>figure when we talk about the tendency of a vacuum to become refilled; 
<A NAME="68"></A>this idea is foolish in the case of blood, and impossible, nay, perfectly 
<A NAME="69"></A>nonsensical, in the case of the urine.
<A NAME="70"></A><BR><BR>This, then, is one blunder made by those who dissociate themselves 
<A NAME="71"></A>from the principle of attraction. Another is that which they make about 
<A NAME="72"></A>the secretion of yellow bile. For in this case, too, it is not a fact that 
<A NAME="73"></A>when the blood runs past the mouths [stomata] of the bile-ducts there will 
<A NAME="74"></A>be a thorough separation out [secretion] of biliary waste-matter. "Well," 
<A NAME="75"></A>say they, "let us suppose that it is not secreted but carried with the 
<A NAME="76"></A>blood all over the body." But, you sapient folk, Erasistratus himself supposed 
<A NAME="77"></A>that Nature took thought for the animals' future, and was workmanlike in 
<A NAME="78"></A>her method; and at the same time he maintained that the biliary fluid was 
<A NAME="79"></A>useless in every way for the animals. Now these two things are incompatible. 
<A NAME="80"></A>For how could Nature be still looked on as exercising forethought for the 
<A NAME="81"></A>animal when she allowed a noxious humour such as this to be carried off 
<A NAME="82"></A>and distributed with the blood?...
<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR>This, however, is a small matter. I shall again point out here 
<A NAME="84"></A>the greatest and most obvious error. For if the yellow bile adjusts itself 
<A NAME="85"></A>to the narrower vessels and stomata, and the blood to the wider ones, for 
<A NAME="86"></A>no other reason than that blood is thicker and bile thinner, and that the 
<A NAME="87"></A>stomata of the veins are wider and those of the bile-ducts narrower, then 
<A NAME="88"></A>it is clear that this watery and serous superfluity, too, will run out 
<A NAME="89"></A>into the bile-ducts quicker than does the bile, exactly in proportion as 
<A NAME="90"></A>it is thinner than the bile! How is it, then, that it does not run out? 
<A NAME="91"></A>"Because," it may be said, "urine is thicker than bile!" This was what 
<A NAME="92"></A>one of our Erasistrateans ventured to say, herein clearly disregarding 
<A NAME="93"></A>the evidence of his senses, although he had trusted these in the case of 
<A NAME="94"></A>the bile and blood. For, if it be that we are to look on bile as thinner 
<A NAME="95"></A>than blood because it runs more, then, since the serous residue passes 
<A NAME="96"></A>through fine linen or lint or a or a sieve more easily even than does bile, 
<A NAME="97"></A>by these tokens bile must also be thicker than the watery fluid. For here, 
<A NAME="98"></A>again, there is no argument which will demonstrate that bile is thinner 
<A NAME="99"></A>than the serous superfluities.
<A NAME="100"></A><BR><BR>But when a man shamelessly goes on using circumlocutions, and never 
<A NAME="101"></A>acknowledges when he has had a fall, he is like the amateur wrestlers, 
<A NAME="102"></A>who, when they have been overthrown by the experts and are lying on their 
<A NAME="103"></A>backs on the ground, so far from recognizing their fall, actually seize 
<A NAME="104"></A>their victorious adversaries by the necks and prevent them from getting 
<A NAME="105"></A>away, thus supposing themselves to be the winners!
<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR>3. Thus, every hypothesis of channels as an explanation of natural 
<A NAME="107"></A>functioning is perfect nonsense. For, if there were not an inborn faculty 
<A NAME="108"></A>given by Nature to each one of the organs at the very beginning, then animals 
<A NAME="109"></A>could not continue to live even for a few days, far less for the number 
<A NAME="110"></A>of years which they actually do. For let us suppose they were under no 
<A NAME="111"></A>guardianship, lacking in creative ingenuity and forethought; let us suppose 
<A NAME="112"></A>they were steered only by material forces, and not by any special faculties 
<A NAME="113"></A>(the one attracting what is proper to it, another rejecting what is foreign, 
<A NAME="114"></A>and yet another causing alteration and adhesion of the matter destined 
<A NAME="115"></A>to nourish it); if we suppose this, I am sure it would be ridiculous for 
<A NAME="116"></A>us to discuss natural, or, still more, psychical, activities- or, in fact, 
<A NAME="117"></A>life as a whole.
<A NAME="118"></A><BR><BR>For there is not a single animal which could live or endure for 
<A NAME="119"></A>the shortest time if, possessing within itself so many different parts, 
<A NAME="120"></A>it did not employ faculties which were attractive of what is appropriate, 
<A NAME="121"></A>eliminative of what is foreign, and alterative of what is destined for 
<A NAME="122"></A>nutrition. On the other hand, if we have these faculties, we no longer 
<A NAME="123"></A>need channels, little or big, resting on an unproven hypothesis, for explaining 
<A NAME="124"></A>the secretion of urine and bile, and the conception of some favourable 
<A NAME="125"></A>situation (in which point alone Erasistratus shows some common sense, since 
<A NAME="126"></A>he does regard all the parts of the body as having been well and truly 
<A NAME="127"></A>placed and shaped by Nature).
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR>But let us suppose he remained true to his own statement that Nature 
<A NAME="129"></A>is "artistic"- this Nature which, at the beginning, well and truly shaped 
<A NAME="130"></A>and disposed all the parts of the animal, and, after carrying out this 
<A NAME="131"></A>function (for she left nothing undone), brought it forward to the light 
<A NAME="132"></A>of day, endowed with certain faculties necessary for its very existence, 
<A NAME="133"></A>and, thereafter, gradually increased it until it reached its due size. 
<A NAME="134"></A>If he argued consistently on this principle, I fail to see how he can continue 
<A NAME="135"></A>to refer natural functions to the smallness or largeness of canals, or 
<A NAME="136"></A>to any other similarly absurd hypothesis. For this Nature which shapes 
<A NAME="137"></A>and gradually adds to the parts is most certainly extended throughout their 
<A NAME="138"></A>whole substance. Yes indeed, she shapes and nourishes and increases them 
<A NAME="139"></A>through and through, not on the outside only. For Praxiteles and Phidias 
<A NAME="140"></A>and all the other statuaries used merely to decorate their material on 
<A NAME="141"></A>the outside, in so far as they were able to touch it; but its inner parts 
<A NAME="142"></A>they left unembellished, unwrought, unaffected by art or forethought, since 
<A NAME="143"></A>they were unable to penetrate therein and to reach and handle all portions 
<A NAME="144"></A>of the material. It is not so, however, with Nature. Every part of a bone 
<A NAME="145"></A>she makes bone, every part of the flesh she makes flesh, and so with fat 
<A NAME="146"></A>and all the rest; there is no part which she has not touched, elaborated, 
<A NAME="147"></A>and embellished. Phidias, on the other hand, could not turn wax into ivory 
<A NAME="148"></A>and gold, nor yet gold into wax: for each of these remains as it was at 
<A NAME="149"></A>the commencement, and becomes a perfect statue simply by being clothed 
<A NAME="150"></A>externally in a form and artificial shape. But Nature does not preserve 
<A NAME="151"></A>the original character of any kind of matter; if she did so, then all parts 
<A NAME="152"></A>of the animal would be blood- that blood, namely, which flows to the semen 
<A NAME="153"></A>from the impregnated female and which is, so to speak, like the statuary's 
<A NAME="154"></A>wax, a single uniform matter, subjected to the artificer. From this blood 
<A NAME="155"></A>there arises no part of the animal which is as red and moist [as blood 
<A NAME="156"></A>is], for bone, artery, vein, nerve, cartilage, fat, gland, membrane, and 
<A NAME="157"></A>marrow are not blood, though they arise from it.
<A NAME="158"></A><BR><BR>I would then ask Erasistratus himself to inform me what the altering, 
<A NAME="159"></A>coagulating, and shaping agent is. He would doubtless say, "Either Nature 
<A NAME="160"></A>or the semen," meaning the same thing in both cases, but explaining it 
<A NAME="161"></A>by different devices. For that which was previously semen, when it begins 
<A NAME="162"></A>to procreate and to shape the animal, becomes, so to say, a special nature. 
<A NAME="163"></A>For in the same way that Phidias possessed the faculties of his art even 
<A NAME="164"></A>before touching his material, and then activated these in connection with 
<A NAME="165"></A>this material (for every faculty remains inoperative in the absence of 
<A NAME="166"></A>its proper material), so it is with the semen: its faculties it possessed 
<A NAME="167"></A>from the beginning, while its activities it does not receive from its material, 
<A NAME="168"></A>but it manifests them in connection therewith.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>And, of course, if it were to be overwhelmed with a great quantity 
<A NAME="170"></A>of blood, it would perish, while if it were to be entirely deprived of 
<A NAME="171"></A>blood it would remain inoperative and would not turn into a nature. Therefore, 
<A NAME="172"></A>in order that it may not perish, but may become a nature in place of semen, 
<A NAME="173"></A>there must be an afflux to it of a little blood- or, rather, one should 
<A NAME="174"></A>not say a little, but a quantity commensurate with that of the semen. What 
<A NAME="175"></A>is it then that measures the quantity of this afflux? What prevents more 
<A NAME="176"></A>from coming? What ensures against a deficiency? What is this third overseer 
<A NAME="177"></A>of animal generation that we are to look for, which will furnish the semen 
<A NAME="178"></A>with a due amount of blood? What would Erasistratus have said if he had 
<A NAME="179"></A>been alive, and had been asked this question? Obviously, the semen itself. 
<A NAME="180"></A>This, in fact, is the artificer analogous with Phidias, whilst the blood 
<A NAME="181"></A>corresponds to the statuary's wax.
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>Now, it is not for the wax to discover for itself how much of it 
<A NAME="183"></A>is required; that is the business of Phidias. Accordingly the artificer 
<A NAME="184"></A>will draw to itself as much blood as it needs. Here, however, we must pay 
<A NAME="185"></A>attention and take care not unwittingly to credit the semen with reason 
<A NAME="186"></A>and intelligence; if we were to do this, we would be making neither semen 
<A NAME="187"></A>nor a nature, but an actual living animal. And if we retain these two principles- 
<A NAME="188"></A>that of proportionate attraction and that of the non-participation of intelligence- 
<A NAME="189"></A>we shall ascribe to the semen a faculty for attracting blood similar to 
<A NAME="190"></A>that possessed by the lodestone for iron. Here, then, again, in the case 
<A NAME="191"></A>of the semen, as in so many previous instances, we have been compelled 
<A NAME="192"></A>to acknowledge some kind of attractive faculty.
<A NAME="193"></A><BR><BR>And what is the semen? Clearly the active principle of the animal, 
<A NAME="194"></A>the material principle being the menstrual blood. Next, seeing that the 
<A NAME="195"></A>active principle employs this faculty primarily, therefore, in order that 
<A NAME="196"></A>any one of the things fashioned by it may come into existence, it [the 
<A NAME="197"></A>principle] must necessarily be possessed of its own faculty. How, then, 
<A NAME="198"></A>was Erasistratus unaware of it, if the primary function of the semen be 
<A NAME="199"></A>to draw to itself a due proportion of blood? Now, this fluid would be in 
<A NAME="200"></A>due proportion if it were so thin and vaporous, that, as soon as it was 
<A NAME="201"></A>drawn like dew into every part of the semen, it would everywhere cease 
<A NAME="202"></A>to display its own particular character; for so the semen will easily dominate 
<A NAME="203"></A>and quickly assimilate it- in fact, will use it as food. It will then, 
<A NAME="204"></A>I imagine, draw to itself a second and a third quantum, and thus by feeding 
<A NAME="205"></A>it acquires for itself considerable bulk and quantity. In fact, the alterative 
<A NAME="206"></A>faculty has now been discovered as well, although about this also has not 
<A NAME="207"></A>written a word. And, thirdly the shaping faculty will become evident, by 
<A NAME="208"></A>virtue of which the semen firstly surrounds itself with a thin membrane 
<A NAME="209"></A>like a kind of superficial condensation; this is what was described by 
<A NAME="210"></A>Hippocrates in the sixth-day birth, which, according to his statement, 
<A NAME="211"></A>fell from the singing-girl and resembled the pellicle of an egg. And following 
<A NAME="212"></A>this all the other stages will occur, such as are described by him in his 
<A NAME="213"></A>work "On the Child's Nature."
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR>But if each of the parts formed were to remain as small as when 
<A NAME="215"></A>it first came into existence, of what use would that be? They have, then, 
<A NAME="216"></A>to grow. Now, how will they grow? By becoming extended in all directions 
<A NAME="217"></A>and at the same time receiving nourishment. And if you will recall what 
<A NAME="218"></A>I previously said about the bladder which the children blew up and rubbed, 
<A NAME="219"></A>you will also understand my meaning better as expressed in what I am now 
<A NAME="220"></A>about to say.
<A NAME="221"></A><BR><BR>Imagine the heart to be, at the beginning, so small as to differ 
<A NAME="222"></A>in no respect from a millet-seed, or, if you will, a bean; and consider 
<A NAME="223"></A>how otherwise it is to become large than by being extended in all directions 
<A NAME="224"></A>and acquiring nourishment throughout its whole substance, in the way that, 
<A NAME="225"></A>as I showed a short while ago, the semen is nourished. But even this was 
<A NAME="226"></A>unknown to Erasistratus- the man who sings the artistic skill of Nature! 
<A NAME="227"></A>He imagines that animals grow like webs, ropes, sacks, or baskets, each 
<A NAME="228"></A>of which has, woven on to its end or margin, other material similar to 
<A NAME="229"></A>that of which it was originally composed.
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR>But this, most sapient sir, is not growth, but genesis! For a bag, 
<A NAME="231"></A>sack, garment, house, ship, or the like is said to be still coming into 
<A NAME="232"></A>existence [undergoing genesis] so long as the appropriate form for the 
<A NAME="233"></A>sake of which it is being constructed by the artificer is still incomplete. 
<A NAME="234"></A>Then, when does it grow? Only when the basket, being complete, with a bottom, 
<A NAME="235"></A>a mouth, and a belly, as it were, as well as the intermediate parts, now 
<A NAME="236"></A>becomes larger in all these respects. "And how can this happen?" someone 
<A NAME="237"></A>will ask. Only by our basket suddenly becoming an animal or a plant; for 
<A NAME="238"></A>growth belongs to living things alone. Possibly you imagine that a house 
<A NAME="239"></A>grows when it is being built, or a basket when being plated, or a garment 
<A NAME="240"></A>when being woven? It is not so, however. Growth belongs to that which has 
<A NAME="241"></A>already been completed in respect to its form, whereas the process by which 
<A NAME="242"></A>that which is still becoming attains its form is termed not growth but 
<A NAME="243"></A>genesis. That which is, grows, while that which is not, 
<A NAME="244"></A>becomes.
<A NAME="245"></A><BR><BR>4. This also was unknown to Erasistratus, whom nothing escaped, 
<A NAME="246"></A>if his followers speak in any way truly in maintaining that he was familiar 
<A NAME="247"></A>with the Peripatetic philosophers. Now, in so far as he acclaims Nature 
<A NAME="248"></A>as being an artist in construction, even I recognize the Peripatetic teachings, 
<A NAME="249"></A>but in other respects he does not come near them. For if anyone will make 
<A NAME="250"></A>himself acquainted with the writings of Aristotle and Theophrastus, these 
<A NAME="251"></A>will appear to him to consist of commentaries on the Nature-lore [physiology] 
<A NAME="252"></A>of Hippocrates- according to which the principles of heat, cold, dryness 
<A NAME="253"></A>and moisture act upon and are acted upon by one another, the hot principle 
<A NAME="254"></A>being the most active, and the cold coming next to it in power; all this 
<A NAME="255"></A>was stated in the first place by Hippocrates and secondly by Aristotle. 
<A NAME="256"></A>Further, it is at once the Hippocratic and the Aristotelian teaching that 
<A NAME="257"></A>the parts which receive that nourishment throughout their whole substance, 
<A NAME="258"></A>and that, similarly, processes of mingling and alteration involve the entire 
<A NAME="259"></A>substance. Moreover, that digestion is a species of alteration- a transmutation 
<A NAME="260"></A>of the nutriment into the proper quality of the thing receiving it; that 
<A NAME="261"></A>blood-production also is an alteration, and nutrition as well; that growth 
<A NAME="262"></A>results from extension in all directions, combined with nutrition; that 
<A NAME="263"></A>alteration is effected mainly by the warm principle, and that therefore 
<A NAME="264"></A>digestion, nutrition, and the generation of the various humours, as well 
<A NAME="265"></A>as the qualities of the surplus substances, result from the innate heat; 
<A NAME="266"></A>all these and many other points besides in regard to the aforesaid faculties, 
<A NAME="267"></A>the origin of diseases, and the discovery of remedies, were correctly stated 
<A NAME="268"></A>first by Hippocrates of all writers whom we know, and were in the second 
<A NAME="269"></A>place correctly expounded by Aristotle. Now, if all these views meet with 
<A NAME="270"></A>the approval of the Peripatetics, as they undoubtedly do, and if none of 
<A NAME="271"></A>them satisfy Erasistratus, what can the Erasistrateans possibly mean by 
<A NAME="272"></A>claiming that their leader was associated with these philosophers? The 
<A NAME="273"></A>fact is, they revere him as a god, and think that everything he says is 
<A NAME="274"></A>true. If this be so, then we must suppose the Peripatetics to have strayed 
<A NAME="275"></A>very far from truth, since they approve of none of the ideas of Erasistratus. 
<A NAME="276"></A>And, indeed, the disciples of the latter produce his connection with the 
<A NAME="277"></A>Peripatetics in order to furnish his Nature-lore with a respectable 
<A NAME="278"></A>pedigree.
<A NAME="279"></A><BR><BR>Now, let us reverse our argument and put it in a different way 
<A NAME="280"></A>from that which we have just employed. For if the Peripatetics were correct 
<A NAME="281"></A>in their teaching about Nature, there could be nothing more absurd than 
<A NAME="282"></A>the contentions of Erasistratus. And, I will leave it to the Erasistrateans 
<A NAME="283"></A>themselves to decide; they must either advance the one proposition or the 
<A NAME="284"></A>other. According to the former one the Peripatetics had no accurate acquaintance 
<A NAME="285"></A>with Nature, and according to the second, Erasistratus. It is my task, 
<A NAME="286"></A>then, to point out the opposition between the two doctrines, and theirs 
<A NAME="287"></A>to make the choice....
<A NAME="288"></A><BR><BR>But they certainly will not abandon their reverence for Erasistratus. 
<A NAME="289"></A>Very well, then; let them stop talking about the Peripatetic philosophers. 
<A NAME="290"></A>For among the numerous physiological teachings regarding the genesis and 
<A NAME="291"></A>destruction of animals, their health, their diseases, and the methods of 
<A NAME="292"></A>treating these, there will be found one only which is common to Erasistratus 
<A NAME="293"></A>and the Peripatetics- namely, the view that Nature does everything for 
<A NAME="294"></A>some purpose, and nothing in vain.
<A NAME="295"></A><BR><BR>But even as regards this doctrine their agreement is only verbal; 
<A NAME="296"></A>in practice Erasistratus makes havoc of it a thousand times over. For, 
<A NAME="297"></A>according to him, the spleen was made for no purpose, as also the omentum; 
<A NAME="298"></A>similarly, too, the arteries which are inserted into kidneys- although 
<A NAME="299"></A>these are practically the largest of all those that spring from the great 
<A NAME="300"></A>artery [aorta]! And to judge by the Erasistratean argument, there must 
<A NAME="301"></A>be countless other useless structures; for, if he knows nothing at all 
<A NAME="302"></A>about these structures, he has little more anatomical knowledge than a 
<A NAME="303"></A>butcher, while, if he is acquainted with them and yet does not state their 
<A NAME="304"></A>use, he clearly imagines that they were made for no purpose, like the spleen. 
<A NAME="305"></A>Why, however, should I discuss these structures fully, belonging as they 
<A NAME="306"></A>do to the treatise "On the Use of Parts," which I am personally about to 
<A NAME="307"></A>complete?
<A NAME="308"></A><BR><BR>Let us, then, sum up again this same argument, and, having said 
<A NAME="309"></A>a few words more in answer to the Erasistrateans, proceed to our next topic. 
<A NAME="310"></A>The fact is, these people seem to me to have read none of Aristotle's writings, 
<A NAME="311"></A>but to have heard from others how great an authority he was on "Nature," 
<A NAME="312"></A>and that those of the Porch follow in the steps of his Nature-lore; apparently 
<A NAME="313"></A>they then discovered a single one of the current ideas which is common 
<A NAME="314"></A>to Aristotle and Erasistratus, and made up some story of a connection between 
<A NAME="315"></A>Erasistratus and these people. That Erasistratus, however, has no share 
<A NAME="316"></A>in the Nature-lore of Aristotle is shown by an enumeration of the aforesaid 
<A NAME="317"></A>doctrines, which emanated first from Hippocrates, secondly from Aristotle, 
<A NAME="318"></A>thirdly from the Stoics (with a single modification, namely, that for them 
<A NAME="319"></A>the qualities are bodies). Perhaps, however, they will maintain that it 
<A NAME="320"></A>was in the matter of logic that Erasistratus associated himself with the 
<A NAME="321"></A>Peripatetic philosophers? Here they show ignorance of the fact that these 
<A NAME="322"></A>philosophers never brought forward false or inconclusive arguments, while 
<A NAME="323"></A>the Erasistratean books are full of them.
<A NAME="324"></A><BR><BR>So perhaps somebody may already be asking, in some surprise, what 
<A NAME="325"></A>possessed Erasistratus that he turned so completely from the doctrines 
<A NAME="326"></A>of Hippocrates, and why it is that he takes away the attractive faculty 
<A NAME="327"></A>from the biliary passages in the liver- for we have sufficiently discussed 
<A NAME="328"></A>the kidneys- alleging [as the cause of bile-secretion] a favourable situation, 
<A NAME="329"></A>the narrowness of vessels, and a common space into which the veins from 
<A NAME="330"></A>the gateway [of the liver] conduct the unpurified blood, and from which, 
<A NAME="331"></A>in the first place, the [biliary] passages take over the bile, and secondly, 
<A NAME="332"></A>the [branches] of the vena cava take over the purified blood. For it would 
<A NAME="333"></A>not only have done him no harm to have mentioned the idea of attraction, 
<A NAME="334"></A>but he would thereby have been able to get rid of countless other disputed 
<A NAME="335"></A>questions.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR><BR>5. At the actual moment, however, the Erasistrateans are engaged 
<A NAME="337"></A>in a considerable battle, not only with others but also amongst themselves, 
<A NAME="338"></A>and so they cannot explain the passage from the first book of the "General 
<A NAME="339"></A>Principles," in which Erasistratus says, "Since there are two kinds of 
<A NAME="340"></A>vessels opening at the same place, the one kind extending to the gall-bladder 
<A NAME="341"></A>and the other to the vena cava, the result is that, of the nutriment carried 
<A NAME="342"></A>up from the alimentary canal, that part which fits both kinds of stomata 
<A NAME="343"></A>is received into both kinds of vessels, some being carried into the gall-bladder, 
<A NAME="344"></A>and the rest passing over into the vena cava." For it is difficult to say 
<A NAME="345"></A>what we are to understand by the words "opening at the same place" which 
<A NAME="346"></A>are written at the beginning of this passage. Either they mean there is 
<A NAME="347"></A>a junction between the termination of the vein which is on the concave 
<A NAME="348"></A>surface of the liver and two other vascular terminations (that of the vessel 
<A NAME="349"></A>on the convex surface of the liver and that of the bile-duct), or, if not, 
<A NAME="350"></A>then we must suppose that there is, as it were, a common space for all 
<A NAME="351"></A>three vessels, which becomes filled from the lower vein, and empties itself 
<A NAME="352"></A>both into the bile-duct and into the branches of the vena cava. Now, there 
<A NAME="353"></A>are many difficulties in both of these explanations, but if I were to state 
<A NAME="354"></A>them all, I should find myself inadvertently writing an exposition of the 
<A NAME="355"></A>teaching of Erasistratus, instead of carrying out my original undertaking. 
<A NAME="356"></A>There is, however, one difficulty common to both these explanations, namely, 
<A NAME="357"></A>that the whole of the blood does not become purified. For it ought to fall 
<A NAME="358"></A>into the bile-duct as into a kind of sieve, instead of going (running, 
<A NAME="359"></A>in fact, rapidly) past it, into the larger stoma, by virtue of the impulse 
<A NAME="360"></A>of anadosis.
<A NAME="361"></A><BR><BR>Are these, then, the only inevitable difficulties in which the 
<A NAME="362"></A>argument of Erasistratus becomes involved through his disinclination to 
<A NAME="363"></A>make any use of the attractive faculty, or is it that the difficulty is 
<A NAME="364"></A>greatest here, and also so obvious that even a child could not avoid seeing 
<A NAME="365"></A>it?
<A NAME="366"></A><BR><BR>6. And if one looks carefully into the matter one will find that 
<A NAME="367"></A>even Erasistratus' reasoning on the subject of nutrition, which he takes 
<A NAME="368"></A>up in the second book of his "General Principles," fails to escape this 
<A NAME="369"></A>same difficulty. For, having conceded one premise to the principle that 
<A NAME="370"></A>matter tends to fill a vacuum, as we previously showed, he was only able 
<A NAME="371"></A>to draw a conclusion in the case of the veins and their contained blood. 
<A NAME="372"></A>That is to say, when blood is running away through the stomata of the veins, 
<A NAME="373"></A>and is being dispersed, then, since an absolutely empty space cannot result, 
<A NAME="374"></A>and the veins cannot collapse (for this was what he overlooked), it was 
<A NAME="375"></A>therefore shown to be necessary that the that the adjoining quantum of 
<A NAME="376"></A>fluid should flow in and fill the place of the fluid evacuated. It is in 
<A NAME="377"></A>this way that we may suppose the veins to be nourished; they get the benefit 
<A NAME="378"></A>of the blood which they contain. But how about the nerves? For they do 
<A NAME="379"></A>not also contain blood. One might obviously say that they draw their supply 
<A NAME="380"></A>from the veins. But Erasistratus will not have it so. What further contrivance, 
<A NAME="381"></A>then, does he suppose? He says that a nerve has within itself veins and 
<A NAME="382"></A>arteries, like a rope woven by Nature out of three different strands. By 
<A NAME="383"></A>means of this hypothesis he imagined that his theory would escape from 
<A NAME="384"></A>the idea of attraction. For if the nerve contain within itself a blood-vessel 
<A NAME="385"></A>it will no longer need the adventitious flow of other blood from the real 
<A NAME="386"></A>vein lying adjacent; this fictitious vessel, perceptible only in theory, 
<A NAME="387"></A>will suffice it for nourishment.
<A NAME="388"></A><BR><BR>But this, again, is succeeded by another similar difficulty. For 
<A NAME="389"></A>this small vessel will nourish itself, but it will not be able to nourish 
<A NAME="390"></A>this adjacent simple nerve or artery, unless these possess some innate 
<A NAME="391"></A>proclivity for attracting nutriment. For how could the nerve, being simple, 
<A NAME="392"></A>attract its nourishment, as do the composite veins, by virtue of the tendency 
<A NAME="393"></A>of a vacuum to become refilled? For, although according to Erasistratus, 
<A NAME="394"></A>it contains within itself a cavity of sorts, this is not occupied with 
<A NAME="395"></A>blood, but with psychic pneuma, and we are required to imagine the nutriment 
<A NAME="396"></A>introduced, not into this cavity, but into the vessel containing it, whether 
<A NAME="397"></A>it needs merely to be nourished, or to grow as well. How, then, are we 
<A NAME="398"></A>to imagine it introduced? For this simple vessel [i.e. nerve] is so small- 
<A NAME="399"></A>as are also the other two- that if you prick it at any part with the finest 
<A NAME="400"></A>needle you will tear the whole three of them at once. Thus there could 
<A NAME="401"></A>never be in it a perceptible space entirely empty. And an emptied space 
<A NAME="402"></A>which merely existed in theory could not compel the adjacent fluid to come 
<A NAME="403"></A>and fill it.
<A NAME="404"></A><BR><BR>At this point, again, I should like Erasistratus himself to answer 
<A NAME="405"></A>regarding this small elementary nerve, whether it is actually one and definitely 
<A NAME="406"></A>continuous, or whether it consists of many small bodies, such as those 
<A NAME="407"></A>assumed by Epicurus, Leucippus, and Democritus. For I see that the Erasistrateans 
<A NAME="408"></A>are at variance on this subject. Some of them consider it one and continuous, 
<A NAME="409"></A>for otherwise, as they say, he would not have called it simple; and some 
<A NAME="410"></A>venture to resolve it into yet other elementary bodies. But if it be one 
<A NAME="411"></A>and continuous, then what is evacuated from it in the so-called insensible 
<A NAME="412"></A>transpiration of the physicians will leave no empty space in it; otherwise 
<A NAME="413"></A>it would not be one body but many, separated by empty spaces. But if it 
<A NAME="414"></A>consists of many bodies, then we have "escaped by the back door," as the 
<A NAME="415"></A>saying is, to Asclepiades, seeing that we have postulated certain inharmonious 
<A NAME="416"></A>elements. Once again, then, we must call Nature "inartistic"; for this 
<A NAME="417"></A>necessarily follows the assumption of such elements.
<A NAME="418"></A><BR><BR>For this reason some of the Erasistrateans seem to me to have done 
<A NAME="419"></A>very foolishly in reducing the simple vessels to elements such as these. 
<A NAME="420"></A>Yet it makes no difference to me, since the theory of both parties regarding 
<A NAME="421"></A>nutrition will be shown to be absurd. For in these minute simple vessels 
<A NAME="422"></A>constituting the large perceptible nerves, it is impossible, according 
<A NAME="423"></A>to the theory of those who would keep the former continuous, that any "refilling 
<A NAME="424"></A>of a vacuum" should take place, since no vacuum can occur in a continuum 
<A NAME="425"></A>even if anything does run away; for the parts left come together (as is 
<A NAME="426"></A>seen in the case of water) and again become one, taking up the whole space 
<A NAME="427"></A>of that which previously separated them. Nor will any "refilling" occur 
<A NAME="428"></A>if we accept the argument of the other Erasistrateans, since none of their 
<A NAME="429"></A>elements need it. For this principle only holds of things which are perceptible, 
<A NAME="430"></A>and not of those which exist merely in theory; this Erasistratus expressly 
<A NAME="431"></A>acknowledges, for he states that it is not a vacuum such as this, interspersed 
<A NAME="432"></A>in small portions among the corpuscles, that his various treatises deal 
<A NAME="433"></A>with, but a vacuum which is clear, perceptible, complete in itself, large 
<A NAME="434"></A>in size, evident, or however else one cares to term it (for, what Erasistratus 
<A NAME="435"></A>himself says is, that "there cannot be a perceptible space which is entirely 
<A NAME="436"></A>empty"; while I, for my part, being abundantly equipped with terms which 
<A NAME="437"></A>are equally elucidatory, at least in relation to the present topic of discussion, 
<A NAME="438"></A>have added them as well).
<A NAME="439"></A><BR><BR>Thus it seems to me better that we also should help the Erasistrateans 
<A NAME="440"></A>with some contribution, since we are on the subject, and should advise 
<A NAME="441"></A>those who reduce the vessel called primary and simple by Erasistratus into 
<A NAME="442"></A>other elementary bodies to give up their opinion; for not only do they 
<A NAME="443"></A>gain nothing by it, but they are also at variance with Erasistratus in 
<A NAME="444"></A>this matter. That they gain nothing by it has been clearly demonstrated; 
<A NAME="445"></A>for this hypothesis could not escape the difficulty regarding nutrition. 
<A NAME="446"></A>And it also seems perfectly evident to me that this hypothesis is not in 
<A NAME="447"></A>consonance with the view of Erasistratus, when it declares that what he 
<A NAME="448"></A>calls simple and primary is composite, and when it destroys the principle 
<A NAME="449"></A>of Nature's artistic skill. For, if we do not grant a certain unity of 
<A NAME="450"></A>substance to these simple structures as well, and if we arrive eventually 
<A NAME="451"></A>at inharmonious and indivisible elements, we shall most assuredly deprive 
<A NAME="452"></A>Nature of her artistic skill, as do all the physicians and philosophers 
<A NAME="453"></A>who start from this hypothesis. For, according to such a hypothesis, Nature 
<A NAME="454"></A>does not precede, but is secondary to the parts of the animal. Now, it 
<A NAME="455"></A>is not the province of what comes secondarily, but of what pre-exists, 
<A NAME="456"></A>to shape and to construct. Thus we must necessarily suppose that the faculties 
<A NAME="457"></A>of Nature, by which she shapes the animal, and makes it grow and receive 
<A NAME="458"></A>nourishment, are present from the seed onwards; whereas none of these inharmonious 
<A NAME="459"></A>and non-partite corpuscles contains within itself any formative, incremental, 
<A NAME="460"></A>nutritive, or, in a word, any artistic power; it is, by hypothesis, unimpressionable 
<A NAME="461"></A>and untransformable, whereas, as we have previously shown, none of the 
<A NAME="462"></A>processes mentioned takes place without transformation, alteration, and 
<A NAME="463"></A>complete intermixture. And, owing to this necessity, those who belong to 
<A NAME="464"></A>these sects are unable to follow out the consequences of their supposed 
<A NAME="465"></A>elements, and they are all therefore forced to declare Nature devoid of 
<A NAME="466"></A>art. It is not from us, however, that the Erasistrateans should have learnt 
<A NAME="467"></A>this, but from those very philosophers who lay most stress on a preliminary 
<A NAME="468"></A>investigation into the elements of all existing things.
<A NAME="469"></A><BR><BR>Now, one can hardly be right in supposing that Erasistratus could 
<A NAME="470"></A>reach such a pitch of foolishness as to be recognizing the logical consequences 
<A NAME="471"></A>of this theory, and that, while assuming Nature to be artistically creative, 
<A NAME="472"></A>he would at the same time break up substance into insensible, inharmonious, 
<A NAME="473"></A>and untransformable elements. If, however, he will grant that there occurs 
<A NAME="474"></A>in the elements a process of alteration and transformation, and that there 
<A NAME="475"></A>exists in them unity and continuity, then that simple vessel of his (as 
<A NAME="476"></A>he himself names it) will turn out to be single and uncompounded. And the 
<A NAME="477"></A>simple vein will receive nourishment from itself, and the nerve and artery 
<A NAME="478"></A>from the vein. How, and in what way? For, when we were at this point before, 
<A NAME="479"></A>we drew attention to the disagreement among the Erasistrateans, and we 
<A NAME="480"></A>showed that the nutrition of these simple vessels was impraticable according 
<A NAME="481"></A>to the teachings of both parties, although we did not hesitate to adjudicate 
<A NAME="482"></A>in their quarrel and to do Erasistratus the honour of placing him in the 
<A NAME="483"></A>better sect.
<A NAME="484"></A><BR><BR>Let our argument, then, be transferred again to the doctrine which 
<A NAME="485"></A>assumes this elementary nerve to be a single, simple, and entirely unified 
<A NAME="486"></A>structure, and let us consider how it is to be nourished; for what is discovered 
<A NAME="487"></A>here will at once be found to be common also to the school of 
<A NAME="488"></A>Hippocrates.
<A NAME="489"></A><BR><BR>It seems to me that our enquiry can be most rigorously pursued 
<A NAME="490"></A>in subjects who are suffering from illness and have become very emaciated, 
<A NAME="491"></A>since in these people all parts of the body are obviously atrophied and 
<A NAME="492"></A>thin, and in need of additional substance and feeding-up; for the same 
<A NAME="493"></A>reason the ordinary perceptible nerve, regarding which we originally began 
<A NAME="494"></A>this discussion, has become thin, and requires nourishment. Now, this contains 
<A NAME="495"></A>within itself various parts, namely, a great many of these primary, invisible, 
<A NAME="496"></A>minute nerves, a few simple arteries, and similarly also veins. Thus, all 
<A NAME="497"></A>its elementary nerves have themselves also obviously become emaciated; 
<A NAME="498"></A>for, if they had not, neither would the nerve as a whole; and of course, 
<A NAME="499"></A>in such a case, the whole nerve cannot require nourishment without each 
<A NAME="500"></A>of these requiring it too. Now, if on the one hand they stand in need of 
<A NAME="501"></A>feeding-up, and if on the other the principle of the refilling of a vacuum 
<A NAME="502"></A>can give them no help- both by reason of the difficulties previously mentioned 
<A NAME="503"></A>and the actual thinness, as I shall show- we must then seek another cause 
<A NAME="504"></A>for nutrition.
<A NAME="505"></A><BR><BR>How is it, then, that the tendency of a vacuum to become refilled 
<A NAME="506"></A>is unable to afford nourishment to one in such a condition? Because its 
<A NAME="507"></A>rule is that only so much of the contiguous matter should succeed as has 
<A NAME="508"></A>flowed away. Now this is sufficient for nourishment in the case of those 
<A NAME="509"></A>who are in good condition, for, in them, what is presented must be equal 
<A NAME="510"></A>to what has flowed away. But in the case of those who are very emaciated 
<A NAME="511"></A>and who need a great restoration of nutrition, unless what was presented 
<A NAME="512"></A>were many times greater than what has been emptied out, they would never 
<A NAME="513"></A>be able to regain their original habit. It is clear, therefore, that these 
<A NAME="514"></A>parts will have to exert a greater amount of attraction, in so far as their 
<A NAME="515"></A>requirements are greater. And I fail to understand how Erasistratus does 
<A NAME="516"></A>not perceive that here again he is putting the cart before the horse. Because, 
<A NAME="517"></A>in the case of the sick, there must be a large amount of presentation in 
<A NAME="518"></A>order to feed them up, he argues that the factor of "refilling" must play 
<A NAME="519"></A>an equally large part. And how could much presentation take place if it 
<A NAME="520"></A>were not preceded by an abundant delivery of nutriment? And if he calls 
<A NAME="521"></A>the conveyance of food through the veins delivery, and its assumption by 
<A NAME="522"></A>each of these simple and visible nerves and arteries not delivery but distribution, 
<A NAME="523"></A>as some people have thought fit to name it, and then ascribes conveyance 
<A NAME="524"></A>through the veins to the principle of vacuum refilling alone, let him explain 
<A NAME="525"></A>to us the assumption of food by the hypothetical elements. For it has been 
<A NAME="526"></A>shown that at least in relation to these there is no question of the refilling 
<A NAME="527"></A>of a vacuum being in operation, and especially where the parts are very 
<A NAME="528"></A>attenuated. It is worth while listening to what Erasistratus says about 
<A NAME="529"></A>these cases in the second book of his "General Principles": "In the ultimate 
<A NAME="530"></A>simple [vessels], which are thin and narrow, presentation takes place from 
<A NAME="531"></A>the adjacent vessels, the nutriment being attracted through the sides of 
<A NAME="532"></A>the vessels and deposited in the empty spaces left by the matter which 
<A NAME="533"></A>has been carried away." Now, in this statement firstly I admit and accept 
<A NAME="534"></A>the words "through the sides." For, if the simple nerve were actually to 
<A NAME="535"></A>take in the food through its mouth, it could not distribute it through 
<A NAME="536"></A>its whole substance; for the mouth is dedicated to the psychic pneuma. 
<A NAME="537"></A>It can, however, take it in through its sides from the adjacent simple 
<A NAME="538"></A>vein. Secondly, I also accept in Erasistratus' statement the expression 
<A NAME="539"></A>which precedes "through the sides." What does this say? "The nutriment 
<A NAME="540"></A>being attracted through the sides of the vessels." Now I, too, agree that 
<A NAME="541"></A>it is attracted, but it has been previously shown that this is not through 
<A NAME="542"></A>the tendency of evacuated matter to be replaced.
<A NAME="543"></A><BR><BR>7. Let us, then, consider together how it is attracted. How else 
<A NAME="544"></A>than in the way that iron is attracted by the lodestone, the latter having 
<A NAME="545"></A>a faculty attractive of this particular quality [existing in iron]? But 
<A NAME="546"></A>if the beginning of anadosis depends on the squeezing action of the stomach, 
<A NAME="547"></A>and the whole movement thereafter on the peristalsis and propulsive action 
<A NAME="548"></A>of the veins, as well as on the traction exerted by each of the parts which 
<A NAME="549"></A>are undergoing nourishment, then we can abandon the principle of replacement 
<A NAME="550"></A>of evacuated matter, as not being suitable for a man who assumes Nature 
<A NAME="551"></A>to be a skilled artist; thus we shall also have avoided the contradiction 
<A NAME="552"></A>of Asclepiades though we cannot refute it: for the disjunctive argument 
<A NAME="553"></A>used for the purposes of demonstration is, in reality, disjunctive not 
<A NAME="554"></A>of two but of three alternatives; now, if we treat the disjunction as a 
<A NAME="555"></A>disjunction of two alternatives, one of the two propositions assumed in 
<A NAME="556"></A>constructing our proof must be false; and if as a disjunctive of three 
<A NAME="557"></A>alternatives, no conclusion will be arrived at.
<A NAME="558"></A><BR><BR>8. Now Erasistratus ought not to have been ignorant of this if 
<A NAME="559"></A>he had ever had anything to do with the Peripatetics- even in a dream. 
<A NAME="560"></A>Nor, similarly, should he have been unacquainted with the genesis of the 
<A NAME="561"></A>humours, about which, not having even anything moderately plausible to 
<A NAME="562"></A>say, he thinks to deceive us by the excuse that the consideration of such 
<A NAME="563"></A>matters is not the least useful. Then, in Heaven's name, is it useful to 
<A NAME="564"></A>know how food is digested in the stomach, but unnecessary to know how bile 
<A NAME="565"></A>comes into existence in the veins? Are we to pay attention merely to the 
<A NAME="566"></A>evacuation of this humour, and not to its genesis? As though it were not 
<A NAME="567"></A>far better to prevent its excessive development from the beginning than 
<A NAME="568"></A>to give ourselves all the trouble of expelling it! And it is a strange 
<A NAME="569"></A>thing to be entirely unaware as to whether its genesis is to be looked 
<A NAME="570"></A>on as taking place in the body, or whether it comes from without and is 
<A NAME="571"></A>contained in the food. For, if it was right to raise this problem, why 
<A NAME="572"></A>should we not make investigations concerning the blood as well- whether 
<A NAME="573"></A>it takes its origin in the body, or is distributed through the food as 
<A NAME="574"></A>is maintained by those who postulate homoeomeries? Assuredly it would be 
<A NAME="575"></A>much more useful to investigate what kinds of food are suited, and what 
<A NAME="576"></A>kinds unsuited, to the process of blood-production rather than to enquire 
<A NAME="577"></A>into what articles of diet are easily mastered by the activity of the stomach, 
<A NAME="578"></A>and what resist and contend with it. For the choice of the latter bears 
<A NAME="579"></A>reference merely to digestion, while that of the former is of importance 
<A NAME="580"></A>in regard to the generation of useful blood. For it is not equally important 
<A NAME="581"></A>whether the aliment be imperfectly chylified in the stomach or whether 
<A NAME="582"></A>it fail to be turned into useful blood. Why is Erasistratus not ashamed 
<A NAME="583"></A>to distinguish all the various kinds of digestive failure and all the occasions 
<A NAME="584"></A>which give rise to them, whilst in reference to the errors of blood-production 
<A NAME="585"></A>he does not utter a single word- nay, not a syllable? Now, there is certainly 
<A NAME="586"></A>to be found in the veins both thick and thin blood; in some people it is 
<A NAME="587"></A>redder, in others yellower, in some blacker, in others more of the nature 
<A NAME="588"></A>of phlegm. And one who realizes that it may smell offensively not in one 
<A NAME="589"></A>way only, but in a great many different respects (which cannot be put into 
<A NAME="590"></A>words, although perfectly appreciable to the senses), would, I imagine, 
<A NAME="591"></A>condemn in no measured terms the carelessness of Erasistratus in omitting 
<A NAME="592"></A>a consideration so essential to the practice of our 
<A NAME="593"></A>art.
<A NAME="594"></A><BR><BR>Thus it is clear what errors in regard to the subject of dropsies 
<A NAME="595"></A>logically follow this carelessness. For, does it not show the most extreme 
<A NAME="596"></A>carelessness to suppose that the blood is prevented from going forward 
<A NAME="597"></A>into the liver owing to the narrowness of the passages, and that dropsy 
<A NAME="598"></A>can never occur in any other way? For, to imagine that dropsy is never 
<A NAME="599"></A>caused by the spleen or any other part, but always by induration of the 
<A NAME="600"></A>liver, is the standpoint of a man whose intelligence is perfectly torpid 
<A NAME="601"></A>and who is quite out of touch with things that happen every day. For, not 
<A NAME="602"></A>merely once or twice, but frequently, we have observed dropsy produced 
<A NAME="603"></A>by chronic haemorrhoids which have been suppressed, or which, through immoderate 
<A NAME="604"></A>bleeding, have given the patient a severe chill; similarly, in women, the 
<A NAME="605"></A>complete disappearance of the monthly discharge, or an undue evacuation 
<A NAME="606"></A>such as is caused by violent bleeding from the womb, often provoke dropsy; 
<A NAME="607"></A>and in some of them the so-called female flux ends in this disorder. I 
<A NAME="608"></A>leave out of account the dropsy which begins in the flanks or in any other 
<A NAME="609"></A>susceptible part; this clearly confutes Erasistratus' assumption, although 
<A NAME="610"></A>not so obviously as does that kind of dropsy which is brought about by 
<A NAME="611"></A>an excessive chilling of the whole constitution; this, which is the primary 
<A NAME="612"></A>reason for the occurrence of dropsy, results from a failure of blood-production, 
<A NAME="613"></A>very much like the diarrhoea which follows imperfect digestion of food; 
<A NAME="614"></A>certainly in this kind of dropsy neither the liver nor any other viscus 
<A NAME="615"></A>becomes indurated.
<A NAME="616"></A><BR><BR>The learned Erasistratus, however, overlooks- nay, despises- what 
<A NAME="617"></A>neither Hippocrates, Diocles, Praxagoras, nor indeed any of the best philosophers, 
<A NAME="618"></A>whether Plato, Aristotle, or Theophrastus; he passes by whole functions 
<A NAME="619"></A>as though it were but a trifling and casual department of medicine which 
<A NAME="620"></A>he was neglecting, without deigning to argue whether or not these authorities 
<A NAME="621"></A>are right in saying that the bodily parts of all animals are governed by 
<A NAME="622"></A>the Warm, the Cold, the Dry and the Moist, the one pair being active the 
<A NAME="623"></A>other passive, and that among these the Warm has most power in connection 
<A NAME="624"></A>with all functions, but especially with the genesis of the humours. Now, 
<A NAME="625"></A>one cannot be blamed for not agreeing with all these great men, nor for 
<A NAME="626"></A>imagining that one knows more than they; but not to consider such distinguished 
<A NAME="627"></A>teaching worthy either of contradiction or even mention shows an extraordinary 
<A NAME="628"></A>arrogance.
<A NAME="629"></A><BR><BR>Now, Erasistratus is thoroughly small-minded and petty to the last 
<A NAME="630"></A>degree in all his disputations- when, for instance, in his treatise "On 
<A NAME="631"></A>Digestion," he argues jealously with those who consider that this is a 
<A NAME="632"></A>process of putrefaction of the food; and, in his work "On Anadosis," with 
<A NAME="633"></A>those who think that the anadosis of blood through the veins results from 
<A NAME="634"></A>the contiguity of the arteries; also, in his work "On Respiration," with 
<A NAME="635"></A>those who maintain that the air is forced along by contraction. Nay, he 
<A NAME="636"></A>did not even hesitate to contradict those who maintain that the urine passes 
<A NAME="637"></A>into the bladder in a vaporous state, as also those who say that imbibed 
<A NAME="638"></A>fluids are carried into the lung. Thus he delights to choose always the 
<A NAME="639"></A>most valueless doctrines, and to spend his time more and more in contradicting 
<A NAME="640"></A>these; whereas on the subject of the origin of blood (which is in no way 
<A NAME="641"></A>less important than the chylification of food in the stomach) he did not 
<A NAME="642"></A>deign to dispute with any of the ancients, nor did he himself venture to 
<A NAME="643"></A>bring forward any other opinion, despite the fact that at the beginning 
<A NAME="644"></A>of his treatise on "General Principles" he undertook to say how all the 
<A NAME="645"></A>various natural functions take place, and through what parts of the animal! 
<A NAME="646"></A>Now, is it possible that, when the faculty which naturally digests food 
<A NAME="647"></A>is weak, the animal's digestion fails, whereas the faculty which turns 
<A NAME="648"></A>the digested food into blood cannot suffer any kind of impairment? Are 
<A NAME="649"></A>we to suppose this latter faculty alone to be as tough as steel and unaffected 
<A NAME="650"></A>by circumstances? Or is it that weakness of this faculty will result in 
<A NAME="651"></A>something else than dropsy? The fact, therefore, that Erasistratus, in 
<A NAME="652"></A>regard to other matters, did not hesitate to attack even the most trivial 
<A NAME="653"></A>views, whilst in this he neither dared to contradict his predecessors nor 
<A NAME="654"></A>to advance any new view of his own, proves plainly that he recognized the 
<A NAME="655"></A>fallacy of his own way of thinking.
<A NAME="656"></A><BR><BR>For what could a man possibly say about blood who had no use for 
<A NAME="657"></A>innate heat? What could he say about yellow or black bile, or phlegm? Well, 
<A NAME="658"></A>of course, he might say that the bile could come directly from without, 
<A NAME="659"></A>mingled with the food! Thus Erasistratus practically says so in the following 
<A NAME="660"></A>words: "It is of no value in practical medicine to find out whether fluid 
<A NAME="661"></A>of this kind arises from the elaboration of food in the stomach-region, 
<A NAME="662"></A>or whether it reaches the body because it is mixed with the food taken 
<A NAME="663"></A>in from outside." But my very good Sir, you most certainly maintain also 
<A NAME="664"></A>that this humour has to be evacuated from the animal, and that it causes 
<A NAME="665"></A>great pain if it be not evacuated. How, then, if you suppose that no good 
<A NAME="666"></A>comes from the bile, do you venture to say that an investigation into its 
<A NAME="667"></A>origin is of no value in medicine?
<A NAME="668"></A><BR><BR>Well, let us suppose that it is contained in the food, and not 
<A NAME="669"></A>specifically secreted in the liver (for you hold these two things possible). 
<A NAME="670"></A>In this case, it will certainly make a considerable difference whether 
<A NAME="671"></A>the ingested food contains a minimum or a maximum of bile; for the one 
<A NAME="672"></A>kind is harmless, whereas that containing a large quantity of bile, owing 
<A NAME="673"></A>to the fact that it cannot be properly purified in the liver, will result 
<A NAME="674"></A>in the various affections- particularly jaundice- which Erasistratus himself 
<A NAME="675"></A>states to occur where there is much bile. Surely, then, it is most essential 
<A NAME="676"></A>for the physician to know in the first place, that the bile is contained 
<A NAME="677"></A>in the food itself from outside, and, secondly, that for example, beet 
<A NAME="678"></A>contains a great deal of bile, and bread very little, while olive oil contains 
<A NAME="679"></A>most, and wine least of all, and all the other articles of diet different 
<A NAME="680"></A>quantities. Would it not be absurd for any one to choose voluntarily those 
<A NAME="681"></A>articles which contain more bile, rather than those containing 
<A NAME="682"></A>less?
<A NAME="683"></A><BR><BR>What, however, if the bile is not contained in the food, but comes 
<A NAME="684"></A>into existence in the animal's body? Will it not also be useful to know 
<A NAME="685"></A>what state of the body is followed by a greater, and what by a smaller 
<A NAME="686"></A>occurrence of bile? For obviously it is in our power to alter and transmute 
<A NAME="687"></A>morbid states of the body- in fact, to give them a turn for the better. 
<A NAME="688"></A>But if we did not know in what respect they were morbid or in what way 
<A NAME="689"></A>they diverged from the normal, how should we be able to ameliorate 
<A NAME="690"></A>them?
<A NAME="691"></A><BR><BR>Therefore it is not useless in treatment, as Erasistratus says, 
<A NAME="692"></A>to know the actual truth about the genesis of bile. Certainly it is not 
<A NAME="693"></A>impossible, or even difficult to discover that the reason why honey produces 
<A NAME="694"></A>yellow bile is not that it contains a large quantity of this within itself, 
<A NAME="695"></A>but because it [the honey] undergoes change, becoming altered and transmuted 
<A NAME="696"></A>into bile. For it would be bitter to the taste if it contained bile from 
<A NAME="697"></A>the outset, and it would produce an equal quantity of bile in every person 
<A NAME="698"></A>who took it. The facts, however, are not so. For in those who are in the 
<A NAME="699"></A>prime of life, especially if they are warm by nature and are leading a 
<A NAME="700"></A>life of toil, the honey changes entirely into yellow bile. Old people, 
<A NAME="701"></A>however, it suits well enough, inasmuch as the alteration which it undergoes 
<A NAME="702"></A>is not into bile, but into blood. Erasistratus, however, in addition to 
<A NAME="703"></A>knowing nothing about this, shows no intelligence even in the division 
<A NAME="704"></A>of his argument; he says that it is of no practical importance to investigate 
<A NAME="705"></A>whether the bile is contained in the food from the beginning or comes into 
<A NAME="706"></A>existence as a result of gastric digestion. He ought surely to have added 
<A NAME="707"></A>something about its genesis in liver and veins, seeing that the old physicians 
<A NAME="708"></A>and philosophers declare that it along with the blood is generated in these 
<A NAME="709"></A>organs. But it is inevitable that people who, from the very outset, go 
<A NAME="710"></A>astray, and wander from the right road, should talk such nonsense, and 
<A NAME="711"></A>should, over and above this, neglect to search for the factors of most 
<A NAME="712"></A>practical importance in medicine.
<A NAME="713"></A><BR><BR>Having come to this poi in the argument, I should like to ask those 
<A NAME="714"></A>who declare that Erasistratus was very familiar with the Peripatetics, 
<A NAME="715"></A>whether they know what Aristotle stated and demonstrated with regard to 
<A NAME="716"></A>our bodies being compounded out of the Warm, the Cold, the Dry and the 
<A NAME="717"></A>Moist, and how he says that among these the Warm is the most active, and 
<A NAME="718"></A>that those animals which are by nature warmest have abundance of blood, 
<A NAME="719"></A>whilst those that are colder are entirely lacking in blood, and consequently 
<A NAME="720"></A>in winter lie idle and motionless, lurking in holes like corpses. Further, 
<A NAME="721"></A>the question of the colour of the blood has been dealt with not only by 
<A NAME="722"></A>Aristotle but also by Plato. Now I, for my part, as I have already said, 
<A NAME="723"></A>did not set before myself the task of stating what has been so well demonstrated 
<A NAME="724"></A>by the Ancients, since I cannot surpass these men either in my views or 
<A NAME="725"></A>in my method of giving them expression. Doctrines, however, which they 
<A NAME="726"></A>either stated without demonstration, as being self-evident (since they 
<A NAME="727"></A>never suspected that there could be sophists so degraded as to contemn 
<A NAME="728"></A>the truth in these matters), or else which they actually omitted to mention 
<A NAME="729"></A>at all- these I propose to discover and prove.
<A NAME="730"></A><BR><BR>Now in reference to the genesis of the humours, I do not know that 
<A NAME="731"></A>any one could add anything wiser than what has been said by Hippocrates, 
<A NAME="732"></A>Aristotle, Praxagoras, Philotimus and many other among the Ancients. These 
<A NAME="733"></A>men demonstrated that when the nutriment becomes altered in the veins by 
<A NAME="734"></A>the innate heat, blood is produced when it is in moderation, and the other 
<A NAME="735"></A>humours when it is not in proper proportion. And all the observed facts 
<A NAME="736"></A>agree with this argument. Thus, those articles of food, which are by nature 
<A NAME="737"></A>warmer are more productive of bile, while those which are colder produce 
<A NAME="738"></A>more phlegm. Similarly of the periods of life, those which are naturally 
<A NAME="739"></A>warmer tend more to bile, and the colder more to phlegm. Of occupations 
<A NAME="740"></A>also, localities and seasons, and, above all, of natures themselves, the 
<A NAME="741"></A>colder are more phlegmatic, and the warmer more bilious. Also cold diseases 
<A NAME="742"></A>result from and warmer ones from yellow bile. There is not a single thing 
<A NAME="743"></A>to be found which does not bear witness to the truth of this account. How 
<A NAME="744"></A>could it be otherwise? For, seeing that every part functions in its own 
<A NAME="745"></A>special way because of the manner in which the four qualities are compounded, 
<A NAME="746"></A>it is absolutely necessary that the function [activity] should be either 
<A NAME="747"></A>completely destroyed, or, at least hampered, by any damage to the qualities, 
<A NAME="748"></A>and that thus the animal should fall ill, either as a whole, or in certain 
<A NAME="749"></A>of its parts.
<A NAME="750"></A><BR><BR>Also the diseases which are primary and most generic are four in 
<A NAME="751"></A>number, and differ from each other in warmth, cold, dryness and moisture. 
<A NAME="752"></A>Now, Erasistratus himself confesses this, albeit unintentionally; for when 
<A NAME="753"></A>he says that the digestion of food becomes worse in fever, not because 
<A NAME="754"></A>the innate heat has ceased to be in due proportion, as people previously 
<A NAME="755"></A>supposed, but because the stomach, with its activity impaired, cannot contract 
<A NAME="756"></A>and triturate as before- then, I say, one may justly ask him what it is 
<A NAME="757"></A>that has impaired the activity of the stomach.
<A NAME="758"></A><BR><BR>Thus, for example, when a bubo develops following an accidental 
<A NAME="759"></A>wound gastric digestion does not become impaired until the patient has 
<A NAME="760"></A>become fevered; neither the bubo nor the sore of itself impedes in any 
<A NAME="761"></A>way or damages the activity of the stomach. But if fever occurs, the digestion 
<A NAME="762"></A>at once deteriorates, and we are also right in saying that the activity 
<A NAME="763"></A>of the stomach at once becomes impaired. We must add, however, by what 
<A NAME="764"></A>it has been impaired. For the wound was not capable of impairing it, nor 
<A NAME="765"></A>yet the bubo, for, if they had been, then they would have caused this damage 
<A NAME="766"></A>before the fever as well. If it was not these that caused it, then it was 
<A NAME="767"></A>the excess of heat (for these two symptoms occurred besides the bubo- an 
<A NAME="768"></A>alteration in the arterial and cardiac movements and an excessive development 
<A NAME="769"></A>of natural heat). Now the alteration of these movements will not merely 
<A NAME="770"></A>not impair the function of the stomach in any way: it will actually prove 
<A NAME="771"></A>an additional help among those animals in which, according to Erasistratus, 
<A NAME="772"></A>the pneuma, which is propelled through the arteries and into the alimentary 
<A NAME="773"></A>canal, is of great service in digestion; there is only left, then, the 
<A NAME="774"></A>disproportionate heat to account for the damage to the gastric activity. 
<A NAME="775"></A>For the pneuma is driven in more vigorously and continuously, and in greater 
<A NAME="776"></A>quantity now than before; thus in this case, the animal whose digestion 
<A NAME="777"></A>is promoted by pneuma will digest more, whereas the remaining factor- abnormal 
<A NAME="778"></A>heat- will give them indigestion. For to say, on the one hand, that the 
<A NAME="779"></A>pneuma has a certain property by virtue of which it promotes digestion, 
<A NAME="780"></A>and then to say that this property disappears in cases of fever, is simply 
<A NAME="781"></A>to admit the absurdity. For when they are again asked what it is that has 
<A NAME="782"></A>altered the pneuma, they will only be able to reply, "the abnormal heat," 
<A NAME="783"></A>and particularly if it be the pneuma in the food canal which is in question 
<A NAME="784"></A>(since this does not come in any way near the bubo).
<A NAME="785"></A><BR><BR>Yet why do I mention those animals in which the property of the 
<A NAME="786"></A>pneuma plays an important part, when it is possible to base one's argument 
<A NAME="787"></A>upon human beings, in whom it is either of no importance at all, or acts 
<A NAME="788"></A>quite faintly and feebly? But Erasistratus himself agrees that human beings 
<A NAME="789"></A>digest badly in fevers, adding as the cause that the activity of the stomach 
<A NAME="790"></A>has been impaired. He cannot, however, advance any other cause of this 
<A NAME="791"></A>impairment than abnormal heat. But if it is not by accident that the abnormal 
<A NAME="792"></A>heat impairs this activity, but by virtue of its own essence and power, 
<A NAME="793"></A>then this abnormal heat must belong to the primary diseases. But, indeed, 
<A NAME="794"></A>if disproportion of heat belongs to the primary diseases, it cannot but 
<A NAME="795"></A>be that a proportionate blending [eucrasia] of the qualities produces the 
<A NAME="796"></A>normal activity. For a disproportionate blend [dyscrasia] can only become 
<A NAME="797"></A>a cause of the primary diseases through derangement of the eucrasia. That 
<A NAME="798"></A>is to say, it is because the [normal] activities arise from the eucrasia 
<A NAME="799"></A>that the primary impairments of these activities necessarily arise the 
<A NAME="800"></A>from derangement.
<A NAME="801"></A><BR><BR>I think, then, it has been proved to the satisfaction of those 
<A NAME="802"></A>who are capable of seeing logical consequences, that, even according to 
<A NAME="803"></A>Erasistratus' own argument, the cause of the normal functions is eucrasia 
<A NAME="804"></A>of the Warm. Now, this being so, there is nothing further to prevent us 
<A NAME="805"></A>from saying that, in the case of each function, eucrasia is followed by 
<A NAME="806"></A>the more, and dyscrasia by the less favourable alternative. And, therefore, 
<A NAME="807"></A>if this be the case, we must suppose blood to be the outcome of proportionate, 
<A NAME="808"></A>and yellow bile of disproportionate heat. So we naturally find yellow bile 
<A NAME="809"></A>appearing in greatest quantity in ourselves at the warm periods of life, 
<A NAME="810"></A>in warm countries, at warm seasons of the year, and when we are in a warm 
<A NAME="811"></A>condition; similarly in people of warm temperaments, and in connection 
<A NAME="812"></A>with warm occupations, modes of life, or diseases.
<A NAME="813"></A><BR><BR>And to be in doubt as to whether this humour has the genesis in 
<A NAME="814"></A>the human body or is contained in the food is what you would expect from 
<A NAME="815"></A>one who has- I will not say failed to see that, when those who are perfectly 
<A NAME="816"></A>healthy have, under the compulsion of circumstances, to fast contrary to 
<A NAME="817"></A>custom, their mouths become bitter and their urine bile-coloured, while 
<A NAME="818"></A>they suffer from gnawing pains in the stomach- but has, as it were, just 
<A NAME="819"></A>made a sudden entrance into the world, and is not yet familiar with the 
<A NAME="820"></A>phenomena which occur there. Who, in fact, does not know that anything 
<A NAME="821"></A>which is overcooked grows at first salt and afterwards bitter? And if you 
<A NAME="822"></A>will boil honey itself, far the sweetest of all things, you can demonstrate 
<A NAME="823"></A>that even this becomes quite bitter. For what may occur as a result of 
<A NAME="824"></A>boiling in the case of other articles which are not warm by nature, exists 
<A NAME="825"></A>naturally in honey; for this reason it does not become sweeter on being 
<A NAME="826"></A>boiled, since exactly the same quantity of heat as is needed for the production 
<A NAME="827"></A>of sweetness exists from beforehand in the honey. Therefore the external 
<A NAME="828"></A>heat, which would be useful for insufficiently warm substances, becomes 
<A NAME="829"></A>in the honey a source of damage, in fact an excess; and it is for this 
<A NAME="830"></A>reason that honey, when boiled, can be demonstrated to become bitter sooner 
<A NAME="831"></A>than the others. For the same reason it is easily transmuted into bile 
<A NAME="832"></A>in those people who are naturally warm, or in their prime, since warm when 
<A NAME="833"></A>associated with warm becomes readily changed into a disproportionate combination 
<A NAME="834"></A>and turns into bile sooner than into blood. Thus we need a cold temperament 
<A NAME="835"></A>and a cold period of life if we would have honey brought to the nature 
<A NAME="836"></A>of blood. Therefore Hippocrates not improperly advised those who were naturally 
<A NAME="837"></A>bilious not to take honey, since they were obviously of too warm a temperament. 
<A NAME="838"></A>So also, not only Hippocrates, but all physicians say that honey is bad 
<A NAME="839"></A>in bilious diseases but good in old age; some of them having discovered 
<A NAME="840"></A>this through the indications afforded by its nature, and others simply 
<A NAME="841"></A>through experiment, for the Empiricist physicians too have made precisely 
<A NAME="842"></A>the same observation, namely, that honey is good for an old man and not 
<A NAME="843"></A>for a young one, that it is harmful for those who are naturally bilious, 
<A NAME="844"></A>and serviceable for those who are phlegmatic. In a word, in bodies which 
<A NAME="845"></A>are warm either through nature, disease, time of life, season of the year, 
<A NAME="846"></A>locality, or occupation, honey is productive of bile, whereas in opposite 
<A NAME="847"></A>circumstances it produces blood.
<A NAME="848"></A><BR><BR>But surely it is impossible that the same article of diet can produce 
<A NAME="849"></A>in certain persons bile and in others blood, if it be not that the genesis 
<A NAME="850"></A>of these humours is accomplished in the body. For if all articles of food 
<A NAME="851"></A>contained bile from the beginning and of themselves, and did not produce 
<A NAME="852"></A>it by undergoing change in the animal body, then they would produce it 
<A NAME="853"></A>similarly in all bodies; the food which was bitter to the taste would, 
<A NAME="854"></A>I take it, be productive of bile, while that which tasted good and sweet 
<A NAME="855"></A>would not generate even the smallest quantity of bile. Moreover, not only 
<A NAME="856"></A>honey but all other sweet substances are readily converted into bile in 
<A NAME="857"></A>the aforesaid bodies which are warm for any of the reasons 
<A NAME="858"></A>mentioned.
<A NAME="859"></A><BR><BR>Well, I have somehow or other been led into this discussion,- not 
<A NAME="860"></A>in accordance with my plan, but compelled by the course of the argument. 
<A NAME="861"></A>This subject has been treated at great length by Aristotle and Praxagoras, 
<A NAME="862"></A>who have correctly expounded the view of Hippocrates and 
<A NAME="863"></A>Plato.
<A NAME="864"></A><BR><BR>9. For this reason the things that we have said are not to be looked 
<A NAME="865"></A>upon as proofs but rather as indications of the dulness of those who think 
<A NAME="866"></A>differently, and who do not even recognise what is agreed on by everyone 
<A NAME="867"></A>and is a matter of daily observation. As for the scientific proofs of all 
<A NAME="868"></A>this, they are to be drawn from these principles of which I have already 
<A NAME="869"></A>spoken- namely, that bodies act upon and are acted upon by each other in 
<A NAME="870"></A>virtue of the Warm, Cold, Moist and Dry. And if one is speaking of any 
<A NAME="871"></A>activity, whether it be exercised by vein, liver, arteries, heart, alimentary 
<A NAME="872"></A>canal, or any part, one will be inevitably compelled to acknowledge that 
<A NAME="873"></A>this activity depends upon the way in which the four qualities are blended. 
<A NAME="874"></A>Thus I should like to ask the Erasistrateans why it is that the stomach 
<A NAME="875"></A>contracts upon the food, and why the veins generate blood. There is no 
<A NAME="876"></A>use in recognizing the mere fact of contraction, without also knowing the 
<A NAME="877"></A>cause; if we know this, we shall also be able to rectify the failures of 
<A NAME="878"></A>function. "This is no concern of ours," they say; "we do not occupy ourselves 
<A NAME="879"></A>with such causes as these; they are outside the sphere of the practitioner, 
<A NAME="880"></A>and belong to that of the scientific investigator." Are you, then, going 
<A NAME="881"></A>to oppose those who maintain that the cause of the function of every organ 
<A NAME="882"></A>is a natural eucrasia, that the dyscrasia is itself known as a disease, 
<A NAME="883"></A>and that it is certainly by this that the activity becomes impaired? Or, 
<A NAME="884"></A>on the other hand, will you be convinced by the proofs which the ancient 
<A NAME="885"></A>writers furnished? Or will you take a midway course between these two, 
<A NAME="886"></A>neither perforce accepting these arguments as true nor contradicting them 
<A NAME="887"></A>as false, but suddenly becoming sceptics- Pyrrhonists, in fact? But if 
<A NAME="888"></A>you do this you will have to shelter yourselves behind the Empiricist teaching. 
<A NAME="889"></A>For how are you going to be successful in treatment, if you do not understand 
<A NAME="890"></A>the real essence of each disease? Why, then, did you not call yourselves 
<A NAME="891"></A>Empiricists from the beginning? Why do you confuse us by announcing that 
<A NAME="892"></A>you are investigating natural activities with a view to treatment? If the 
<A NAME="893"></A>stomach is, in a particular case, unable to exercise its peristaltic and 
<A NAME="894"></A>grinding functions, how are we going to bring it back to the normal if 
<A NAME="895"></A>we do not know the cause of its disability? What I say is that we must 
<A NAME="896"></A>cool the over-heated stomach and warm the warm the chilled one; so also 
<A NAME="897"></A>we must moisten the one which has become dried up, and conversely; so, 
<A NAME="898"></A>too, in combinations of these conditions; if the stomach becomes at the 
<A NAME="899"></A>same time warmer and drier than normally, the first principle of treatment 
<A NAME="900"></A>is at once to chill and moisten it; and if it become colder and moister, 
<A NAME="901"></A>it must be warmed and dried; so also in other cases. But how on earth are 
<A NAME="902"></A>the followers of Erasistratus going to act, confessing as they do that 
<A NAME="903"></A>they make no sort of investigation into the cause of disease? For the fruit 
<A NAME="904"></A>of the enquiry into activities is that by knowing the causes of the dyscrasiae 
<A NAME="905"></A>one may bring them back to the normal, since it is of no use for the purposes 
<A NAME="906"></A>of treatment merely to know what the activity of each organ 
<A NAME="907"></A>is.
<A NAME="908"></A><BR><BR>Now, it seems to me that Erasistratus is unaware of this fact also, 
<A NAME="909"></A>that the actual disease is that condition of the body which, not accidentally, 
<A NAME="910"></A>but primarily and of itself, impairs the normal function. How, then, is 
<A NAME="911"></A>he going to diagnose or cure diseases if he is entirely ignorant of what 
<A NAME="912"></A>they are, and of what kind and number? As regards the stomach, certainly, 
<A NAME="913"></A>Erasistratus held that one should at least investigate how it digests the 
<A NAME="914"></A>food. But why was not investigation also made as to the primary originative 
<A NAME="915"></A>cause of this? And, as regards the veins and the blood, he omitted even 
<A NAME="916"></A>to ask the question "how?"
<A NAME="917"></A><BR><BR>Yet neither Hippocrates nor any of the other physicians or philosophers 
<A NAME="918"></A>whom I mentioned a short while ago thought it right to omit this; they 
<A NAME="919"></A>say that when the heat which exists naturally in every animal is well blended 
<A NAME="920"></A>and moderately moist it generates blood; for this reason they also say 
<A NAME="921"></A>that the blood is a virtually warm and moist humour, and similarly also 
<A NAME="922"></A>that yellow bile is warm and dry, even though for the most part it appears 
<A NAME="923"></A>moist. (For in them the apparently dry would seem to differ from the virtually 
<A NAME="924"></A>dry.) Who does not know that brine and sea-water preserve meat and keep 
<A NAME="925"></A>it uncorrupted, whilst all other water- the drinkable kind- readily spoils 
<A NAME="926"></A>and rots it? And who does not know that when yellow bile is contained in 
<A NAME="927"></A>large quantity in the stomach, we are troubled with an unquenchable thirst, 
<A NAME="928"></A>and that when we vomit this up, we at once become much freer from thirst 
<A NAME="929"></A>than if we had drunk very large quantities of fluid? Therefore this humour 
<A NAME="930"></A>has been very properly termed warm, and also virtually dry. And, similarly, 
<A NAME="931"></A>phlegm has been called cold and moist; for about this also clear proofs 
<A NAME="932"></A>have been given by Hippocrates and the other Ancients.
<A NAME="933"></A><BR><BR>Prodicus also, when in his book "On the Nature of Man" he gives 
<A NAME="934"></A>the name "phlegm" to that element in the humours which has been burned 
<A NAME="935"></A>or, as it were, over-roasted, while using a different terminology, still 
<A NAME="936"></A>keeps to the fact just as the others do; this man's innovations in nomenclature 
<A NAME="937"></A>have also been amply done justice to by Plato. Thus, the white-coloured 
<A NAME="938"></A>substance which everyone else calls phlegm, and which Prodicus calls blenna 
<A NAME="939"></A>[mucus], is the well-known cold, moist humour which collects mostly in 
<A NAME="940"></A>old people and in those who have been chilled in some way, and not even 
<A NAME="941"></A>a lunatic could say that this was anything else than cold and 
<A NAME="942"></A>moist.
<A NAME="943"></A><BR><BR>If, then, there is a warm and moist humour, and another which is 
<A NAME="944"></A>warm and dry, and yet another which is moist and cold, is there none which 
<A NAME="945"></A>is virtually cold and dry? Is the fourth combination of temperaments, which 
<A NAME="946"></A>exists in all other things, non-existent in the humours alone? No; the 
<A NAME="947"></A>black bile is such a humour. This, according to intelligent physicians 
<A NAME="948"></A>and philosophers, tends to be in excess, as regards seasons, mainly in 
<A NAME="949"></A>the fall of the year, and, as regards ages, mainly after the prime of life. 
<A NAME="950"></A>And, similarly, also they say that there are cold and dry modes of life, 
<A NAME="951"></A>regions, constitutions, and diseases. Nature, they suppose, is not defective 
<A NAME="952"></A>in this single combination; like the three other combinations, it extends 
<A NAME="953"></A>everywhere.
<A NAME="954"></A><BR><BR>At this point, also, I would gladly have been able to ask Erasistratus 
<A NAME="955"></A>whether his "artistic" Nature has not constructed any organ for clearing 
<A NAME="956"></A>away a humour such as this. For whilst there are two organs for the excretion 
<A NAME="957"></A>of urine, and another of considerable size for that of yellow bile, does 
<A NAME="958"></A>the humour which is more pernicious than these wander about persistently 
<A NAME="959"></A>in the veins mingled with the blood? Yet Hippocrates says, "Dysentery is 
<A NAME="960"></A>a fatal condition if it proceeds from black bile"; while that proceeding 
<A NAME="961"></A>from yellow bile is by no means deadly, and most people recover from it; 
<A NAME="962"></A>this proves how much more pernicious and acrid in its potentialities is 
<A NAME="963"></A>black than yellow bile. Has Erasistratus, then, not read the book, "On 
<A NAME="964"></A>the Nature of Man," any more than any of the rest of Hippocrates' writings, 
<A NAME="965"></A>that he so carelessly passes over the consideration of the humours? Or, 
<A NAME="966"></A>does the know it, and yet voluntarily neglect one of the finest studies 
<A NAME="967"></A>in medicine? Thus he ought not to have said anything about the spleen, 
<A NAME="968"></A>nor have stultified himself by holding that an artistic Nature would have 
<A NAME="969"></A>prepared so large an organ for no purpose. As a matter of fact, not a matter 
<A NAME="970"></A>of fact, not only Hippocrates and Plato- who are no less authorities on 
<A NAME="971"></A>Nature than is Erasistratus- say that this viscus also is one of those 
<A NAME="972"></A>which cleanse the blood, but there are thousands of the ancient physicians 
<A NAME="973"></A>and philosophers as well who are in agreement with them. Now, all of these 
<A NAME="974"></A>the high and mighty Erasistratus affected to despise, and he neither contradicted 
<A NAME="975"></A>them nor even so much as mentioned their opinion. Hippocrates, indeed, 
<A NAME="976"></A>says that the spleen wastes in those people in whom the body is in good 
<A NAME="977"></A>condition, and all those physicians also who base themselves on experience 
<A NAME="978"></A>agree with this. Again, in those cases in which the spleen is large and 
<A NAME="979"></A>is increasing from internal suppuration, it destroys the body and fills 
<A NAME="980"></A>it with evil humours; this again is agreed on, not only by Hippocrates, 
<A NAME="981"></A>but also by Plato and many others, including the Empiric physicians. And 
<A NAME="982"></A>the jaundice which occurs when the spleen is out of order is darker in 
<A NAME="983"></A>colour, and the cicatrices of ulcers are dark. For, generally speaking, 
<A NAME="984"></A>when the spleen is drawing the atrabiliary humour into itself to a less 
<A NAME="985"></A>degree than is proper, the blood is unpurified, and the whole body takes 
<A NAME="986"></A>on a bad colour. And when does it draw this in to a less degree than proper? 
<A NAME="987"></A>Obviously, when it [the spleen] is in a bad condition. Thus, just as the 
<A NAME="988"></A>kidneys, whose function it is to attract the urine, do this badly when 
<A NAME="989"></A>they are out or order, so also the spleen, which has in itself a native 
<A NAME="990"></A>power of attracting an atrabiliary quality,if it ever happens to be weak, 
<A NAME="991"></A>must necessarily exercise this attraction badly, with the result that the 
<A NAME="992"></A>blood becomes thicker and darker.
<A NAME="993"></A><BR><BR>Now all these points, affording as they do the greatest help in 
<A NAME="994"></A>the diagnosis and in the cure of disease were entirely passed over by Erasistratus, 
<A NAME="995"></A>and he pretended to despise these great men- he who does not despise ordinary 
<A NAME="996"></A>people, but always jealously attacks the most absurd doctrines. Hence, 
<A NAME="997"></A>it was clearly because he had nothing to say against the statements made 
<A NAME="998"></A>by the Ancients regarding the function and utility of the spleen, and also 
<A NAME="999"></A>because he could discover nothing new himself, that he ended by saying 
<A NAME="1000"></A>nothing at all. I, however, for my part, have demonstrated, firstly from 
<A NAME="1001"></A>the causes by which everything throughout nature is governed (by the causes 
<A NAME="1002"></A>I mean the Warm, Cold, Dry and Moist) and secondly, from obvious bodily 
<A NAME="1003"></A>phenomena, that there must needs be a cold and dry humour. And having in 
<A NAME="1004"></A>the next place drawn attention to the fact that this humour is black bile 
<A NAME="1005"></A>[atrabiliary] and that the viscus which clears it away is the spleen- having 
<A NAME="1006"></A>pointed this out by help of as few as possible of the proofs given by ancient 
<A NAME="1007"></A>writers, I shall now proceed to what remains of the subject in 
<A NAME="1008"></A>hand.
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR><BR>What else, then, remains but to explain clearly what it is that 
<A NAME="1010"></A>happens in the generation of the humours, according to the belief and demonstration 
<A NAME="1011"></A>of the Ancients? This will be more clearly understood from a comparison. 
<A NAME="1012"></A>Imagine, then, some new wine which has been not long ago pressed from the 
<A NAME="1013"></A>grape, and which is fermenting and undergoing alteration through the agency 
<A NAME="1014"></A>of its contained heat. Imagine next two residual substances produced during 
<A NAME="1015"></A>this process of alteration, the one tending to be light and air-like and 
<A NAME="1016"></A>the other to be heavy and more of the nature of earth; of these the one, 
<A NAME="1017"></A>as I understand, they call the flower and the other the lees. Now you may 
<A NAME="1018"></A>correctly compare yellow bile to the first of these, and black bile to 
<A NAME="1019"></A>the latter, although these humours have not the same appearance when the 
<A NAME="1020"></A>animal is in normal health as that which they often show when it is not 
<A NAME="1021"></A>so; for then the yellow bile becomes vitelline, being so termed because 
<A NAME="1022"></A>it becomes like the yolk of an egg, both in colour and density; and again, 
<A NAME="1023"></A>even the black bile itself becomes much more malignant than when in its 
<A NAME="1024"></A>normal condition, but no particular name has been given to [such a condition 
<A NAME="1025"></A>of] the humour, except that some people have called it corrosive or acetose, 
<A NAME="1026"></A>because it also becomes sharp like vinegar and corrodes the animal's body- 
<A NAME="1027"></A>as also the earth, if it be poured out upon it- and it produces a kind 
<A NAME="1028"></A>of fermentation and seething, accompanied by bubbles- an abnormal putrefaction 
<A NAME="1029"></A>having become added to the natural condition of the black humour. It seems 
<A NAME="1030"></A>to me also that most of the ancient physicians give the name black humour 
<A NAME="1031"></A>and not black bile to the normal portion of this humour, which is discharged 
<A NAME="1032"></A>from the bowel and which also frequently rises to the top [of the stomach-contents]; 
<A NAME="1033"></A>and they call black bile that part which, through a kind of combustion 
<A NAME="1034"></A>and putrefaction, has had its quality changed to acid. There is no need, 
<A NAME="1035"></A>however, to dispute about names, but we must realise the facts, which are 
<A NAME="1036"></A>as follow:-
<A NAME="1037"></A><BR><BR>In the genesis of blood, everything in the nutriment which belongs 
<A NAME="1038"></A>naturally to the thick and earth-like part of the food, and which does 
<A NAME="1039"></A>not take on well the alteration produced by the innate heat- all this the 
<A NAME="1040"></A>spleen draws into itself. On the other hand, that part of the nutriment 
<A NAME="1041"></A>which is roasted, so to speak, or burnt (this will be the warmest and sweetest 
<A NAME="1042"></A>part of it, like honey and fat), becomes yellow bile, and is cleared away 
<A NAME="1043"></A>through the so-called biliary vessels; now, this is thin, moist, and fluid, 
<A NAME="1044"></A>not like what it is when, having been roasted to an excessive degree, it 
<A NAME="1045"></A>becomes yellow, fiery, and thick, like the yolk of eggs; for this latter 
<A NAME="1046"></A>is already abnormal, while the previously mentioned state is natural. Similarly 
<A NAME="1047"></A>with the black humour: that which does not yet produce, as I say, this 
<A NAME="1048"></A>seething and fermentation on the ground, is natural, while that which has 
<A NAME="1049"></A>taken over this character and faculty is unnatural; it has assumed an acridity 
<A NAME="1050"></A>owing to the combustion caused by abnormal heat, and has practically become 
<A NAME="1051"></A>transformed into ashes. In somewhat the same way burned lees differ from 
<A NAME="1052"></A>unburned. The former is a warm substance, able to burn, dissolve, and destroy 
<A NAME="1053"></A>the flesh. The other kind, which has not yet undergone combustion, one 
<A NAME="1054"></A>may find the physicians employing for the same purposes that one uses the 
<A NAME="1055"></A>so-called potter's earth and other substances which have naturally a combined 
<A NAME="1056"></A>drying and chilling action.
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR><BR>Now the vitelline bile also may take on the appearance of this 
<A NAME="1058"></A>combusted black bile, if ever it chance to be roasted, so to say, by fiery 
<A NAME="1059"></A>heat. And all the other forms of bile are produced, some the from blending 
<A NAME="1060"></A>of those mentioned, others being, as it were, transition-stages in the 
<A NAME="1061"></A>genesis of these or in their conversion into one another. And they differ 
<A NAME="1062"></A>in that those first mentioned are unmixed and unique, while the latter 
<A NAME="1063"></A>forms are diluted with various kinds of serum. And all the serums in the 
<A NAME="1064"></A>humours are waste substances, and the animal body needs to be purified 
<A NAME="1065"></A>from them. There is, however, a natural use for the humours first mentioned, 
<A NAME="1066"></A>both thick and thin; the blood is purified both by the spleen and by the 
<A NAME="1067"></A>bladder beside the liver, and a part of each of the two humours is put 
<A NAME="1068"></A>away, of such quantity and quality that, if it were carried all over the 
<A NAME="1069"></A>body, it would do a certain amount of harm. For that which is decidedly 
<A NAME="1070"></A>thick and earthy in nature, and has entirely escaped alteration in the 
<A NAME="1071"></A>liver, is drawn by the spleen into itself; the other part which is only 
<A NAME="1072"></A>moderately thick, after being elaborated [in the liver], is carried all 
<A NAME="1073"></A>over the body. For the blood in many parts of the body has need of a certain 
<A NAME="1074"></A>amount of thickening, as also, I take it, of the fibres which it contains. 
<A NAME="1075"></A>And the use of these has been discussed by Plato, and it will also be discussed 
<A NAME="1076"></A>by me in such of my treatises as may deal with the use of parts. And the 
<A NAME="1077"></A>blood also needs, not least
