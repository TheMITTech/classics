<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>1. It has been made clear in the preceding discussion that nutrition occurs 
<A NAME="11"></A>by an alteration or assimilation of that which nourishes to that which 
<A NAME="12"></A>receives nourishment, and that there exists in every part of the animal 
<A NAME="13"></A>a faculty which in view of its activity we call, in general terms, alterative, 
<A NAME="14"></A>or, more specifically, assimilative and nutritive. It was also shown that 
<A NAME="15"></A>a sufficient supply of the matter which the part being nourished makes 
<A NAME="16"></A>into nutriment for itself is ensured by virtue of another faculty which 
<A NAME="17"></A>naturally attracts its proper juice [humour] that juice is proper to each 
<A NAME="18"></A>part which is adapted for assimilation, and that the faculty which attracts 
<A NAME="19"></A>the juice is called, by reason of its activity, attractive or epispastic. 
<A NAME="20"></A>It has also been shown that assimilation is preceded by adhesion, and this, 
<A NAME="21"></A>again, by presentation, the latter stage being, as one might say, the end 
<A NAME="22"></A>or goal of the activity corresponding to the attractive faculty. For the 
<A NAME="23"></A>actual bringing up of nutriment from the veins into each of the parts takes 
<A NAME="24"></A>place through the activation of the attractive faculty, whilst to have 
<A NAME="25"></A>been finally brought up and presented to the part is the actual end for 
<A NAME="26"></A>which we desired such an activity; it is attracted in order that it may 
<A NAME="27"></A>be presented. After this, considerable time is needed for the nutrition 
<A NAME="28"></A>of the animal; whilst a thing may be even rapidly attracted, on the other 
<A NAME="29"></A>hand to become adherent, altered, and entirely assimilated to the part 
<A NAME="30"></A>which is being nourished and to become a part of it, cannot take place 
<A NAME="31"></A>suddenly, but requires a considerable amount of time. But if the nutritive 
<A NAME="32"></A>juice, so presented, does not remain in the part, but withdraws to another 
<A NAME="33"></A>one, and keeps flowing away, and constantly changing and shifting its position, 
<A NAME="34"></A>neither adhesion nor complete assimilation will take place in any of them. 
<A NAME="35"></A>Here too, then, the [animal's] nature has need of some other faculty for 
<A NAME="36"></A>ensuring a prolonged stay of the presented juice at the part, and this 
<A NAME="37"></A>not a faculty which comes in from somewhere outside but one which is resident 
<A NAME="38"></A>in the part which is to be nourished. This faculty, again, in view of its 
<A NAME="39"></A>activity our predecessors were obliged to call retentive.
<A NAME="40"></A><BR><BR>Thus our argument has clearly shown the necessity for the genesis 
<A NAME="41"></A>of such a faculty, and whoever has an appreciation of logical sequence 
<A NAME="42"></A>must be firmly persuaded from what we have said that, if it be laid down 
<A NAME="43"></A>and proved by previous demonstration that Nature is artistic and solicitous 
<A NAME="44"></A>for the animal's welfare, it necessarily follows that she must also possess 
<A NAME="45"></A>a faculty of this kind.
<A NAME="46"></A><BR><BR>2. Since, however, it is not our habit to employ this kind of demonstration 
<A NAME="47"></A>alone, but to add thereto cogent and compelling proofs drawn from obvious 
<A NAME="48"></A>facts, we will also proceed to the latter kind in the present instance: 
<A NAME="49"></A>we will demonstrate that in certain parts of the body the retentive faculty 
<A NAME="50"></A>is so obvious that its operation can be actually recognised by the senses, 
<A NAME="51"></A>whilst in other parts it is less obvious to the senses, but is capable 
<A NAME="52"></A>even here of being detected by the argument.
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR>Let us begin our exposition, then, by first dealing systematically 
<A NAME="54"></A>for a while with certain definite parts of the body, in reference to which 
<A NAME="55"></A>we may accurately test and enquire what sort of thing the retentive faculty 
<A NAME="56"></A>is.
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR>Now, could one begin the enquiry in any better way than with the 
<A NAME="58"></A>largest and hollowest organs? Personally I do not think one could. It is 
<A NAME="59"></A>to be expected that in these, owing to their size, the activities will 
<A NAME="60"></A>show quite clearly, whereas with respect to the small organs, even if they 
<A NAME="61"></A>possess a strong faculty of this kind, its activation will not at once 
<A NAME="62"></A>be recognisable to sense.
<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR>Now those parts of the animal which are especially hollow and large 
<A NAME="64"></A>are the stomach and the organ which is called the womb or uterus. What 
<A NAME="65"></A>prevents us, then, from taking up these first and considering their activities, 
<A NAME="66"></A>conducting the enquiry on our own persons in regard to those activities 
<A NAME="67"></A>which are obvious without dissection, and, in the case of those which are 
<A NAME="68"></A>more obscure, dissecting animals which are near to man; not that even animals 
<A NAME="69"></A>unlike him will not show, in a general way, the faculty in question, but 
<A NAME="70"></A>because in this manner we may find out at once what is common to all and 
<A NAME="71"></A>what is peculiar to ourselves, and so may become more resourceful in the 
<A NAME="72"></A>diagnosis and treatment of disease.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>Now it is impossible to speak of both organs at once, so we shall 
<A NAME="74"></A>deal with each in turn, beginning with the one which is capable of demonstrating 
<A NAME="75"></A>the retentive faculty most plainly. For the stomach retains the food until 
<A NAME="76"></A>it has quite digested it, and the uterus retains the embryo until it brings 
<A NAME="77"></A>it to completion, but the time taken for the completion of the embryo is 
<A NAME="78"></A>many times more than that for the digestion of food.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>3. We may expect, then, to detect the retentive faculty in the 
<A NAME="80"></A>uterus more clearly in proportion to the longer duration of its activity 
<A NAME="81"></A>as compared with that of the stomach. For, as we know, it takes nine months 
<A NAME="82"></A>in most women for the foetus to attain maturity in the womb, this organ 
<A NAME="83"></A>having its neck quite closed, and entirely surrounding the embryo together 
<A NAME="84"></A>with the chorion. Further, it is the utility of the function which determines 
<A NAME="85"></A>the closure of the os and the stay of the foetus in the uterus. For it 
<A NAME="86"></A>is not casually nor without reason that Nature has made the uterus capable 
<A NAME="87"></A>of contracting upon, and of retaining the embryo, but in order that the 
<A NAME="88"></A>latter may arrive at a proper size. When, therefore, the object for which 
<A NAME="89"></A>the uterus brought its retentive faculty into play has been fulfilled, 
<A NAME="90"></A>it then stops this faculty and brings it back to a state of rest, and employs 
<A NAME="91"></A>instead of it another faculty hitherto quiescent- the propulsive faculty. 
<A NAME="92"></A>In this case again the quiescent and active states are both determined 
<A NAME="93"></A>by utility; when this calls, there is activity; when it does not, there 
<A NAME="94"></A>is rest.
<A NAME="95"></A><BR><BR>Here, then, once more, we must observe well the Art [artistic tendency] 
<A NAME="96"></A>of Nature- how she has not merely placed in each organ the capabilities 
<A NAME="97"></A>of useful activities, but has also fore-ordained the times both of rest 
<A NAME="98"></A>and movement. For everything connected with the pregnancy proceeds properly, 
<A NAME="99"></A>the eliminative faculty remains quiescent as though it did not exist, but 
<A NAME="100"></A>if anything goes wrong in connection either with the chorion or any of 
<A NAME="101"></A>the other membranes or with the foetus itself, and its completion is entirely 
<A NAME="102"></A>despaired of, then the uterus no longer awaits the nine-months period, 
<A NAME="103"></A>but the retentive faculty forthwith ceases and allows the heretofore inoperative 
<A NAME="104"></A>faculty to come into action. Now it is that something is done- in fact, 
<A NAME="105"></A>useful work effected- by the eliminative or propulsive faculty (for so 
<A NAME="106"></A>it, too, has been called, receiving, like the rest,its names from the corresponding 
<A NAME="107"></A>activities).
<A NAME="108"></A><BR><BR>Further, our theory can, I think, demonstrate both together; for 
<A NAME="109"></A>seeing that they succeed each other, and that the one keeps giving place 
<A NAME="110"></A>to the other according as utility demands, it seems not unreasonable to 
<A NAME="111"></A>accept a common demonstration also for both. Thus it is the work of the 
<A NAME="112"></A>retentive faculty to make the uterus contract upon the foetus at every 
<A NAME="113"></A>point, so that, naturally enough, when the midwives palpate it, the os 
<A NAME="114"></A>is found to be closed, whilst the pregnant women themselves, during the 
<A NAME="115"></A>first days- and particularly on that on which conception takes place- experience 
<A NAME="116"></A>a sensation as if the uterus were moving and contracting upon itself. Now, 
<A NAME="117"></A>if both of these things occur- if the os closes apart from inflammation 
<A NAME="118"></A>or any other disease, and if this is accompanied by a feeling of movement 
<A NAME="119"></A>in the uterus- then the women believe that they have received the semen 
<A NAME="120"></A>which comes from the male, and that they are retaining 
<A NAME="121"></A>it.
<A NAME="122"></A><BR><BR>Now we are not inventing this for ourselves: one may say the statement 
<A NAME="123"></A>is based on prolonged experience of those who occupy themselves with such 
<A NAME="124"></A>matters. Thus Herophilus does not hesitate to state in his writings that 
<A NAME="125"></A>up to the time of labour the os uteri will not admit so much as the tip 
<A NAME="126"></A>of a probe, that it no longer opens to the slightest degree if pregnancy 
<A NAME="127"></A>has begun- that, in fact, it dilates more widely at the times of the menstrual 
<A NAME="128"></A>flow. With him are in agreement all the others who have applied themselves 
<A NAME="129"></A>to this subject; and particularly Hippocrates, who was the first of all 
<A NAME="130"></A>physicians and philosophers to declare that the os uteri closes during 
<A NAME="131"></A>pregnancy and inflammation, albeit in pregnancy it does not depart from 
<A NAME="132"></A>its own nature, whilst in inflammation it becomes hard.
<A NAME="133"></A><BR><BR>In the case of the opposite (the eliminative) faculty, the os opens, 
<A NAME="134"></A>whilst the whole fundus approaches as near as possible to the os, expelling 
<A NAME="135"></A>the embryo as it does so; and along with the fundus the contiguous parts- 
<A NAME="136"></A>which form as it were a girdle round the whole organ- cooperate in the 
<A NAME="137"></A>work; they squeeze upon the embryo and propel it bodily outwards. And, 
<A NAME="138"></A>in many women who exercise such a faculty immoderately, violent pains cause 
<A NAME="139"></A>forcible prolapse of the whole womb; here almost the same thing happens 
<A NAME="140"></A>as frequently occurs in wresting-bouts and struggles, when in our eagerness 
<A NAME="141"></A>to overturn and throw others we are ourselves upset along with them; for 
<A NAME="142"></A>similarly when the uterus is forcing the embryo forward it sometimes becomes 
<A NAME="143"></A>entirely prolapsed, and particularly when the ligaments connecting it with 
<A NAME="144"></A>the spine happen to be naturally lax.
<A NAME="145"></A><BR><BR>A wonderful device of Nature's also is this- that, when the foetus 
<A NAME="146"></A>is alive, the os uteri is closed with perfect accuracy, but if it dies, 
<A NAME="147"></A>the os at once opens up to the extent which is necessary for the foetus 
<A NAME="148"></A>to make its exit. The midwife, however, does not make the parturient woman 
<A NAME="149"></A>get up at once and sit down on the [obstetric] chair, but she begins by 
<A NAME="150"></A>palpating the os as it gradually dilates, and the first thing she says 
<A NAME="151"></A>is that it has dilated "enough to admit the little finger," then that "it 
<A NAME="152"></A>is bigger now," and as we make enquiries from time to time, she answers 
<A NAME="153"></A>that the size of the dilatation is increasing. And when it is sufficient 
<A NAME="154"></A>to allow of the transit of the foetus, she then makes the patient get up 
<A NAME="155"></A>from her bed and sit on the chair, and bids her make every effort to expel 
<A NAME="156"></A>the child. Now, this additional work which the patient does of herself 
<A NAME="157"></A>is no longer the work of the uterus but of the epigastric muscles, which 
<A NAME="158"></A>also help us in defaecation and micturition.
<A NAME="159"></A><BR><BR>4. Thus the two faculties are clearly to be seen in the case of 
<A NAME="160"></A>the uterus; in the case of the stomach they appear as follows:- Firstly 
<A NAME="161"></A>in the condition of gurgling, which physicians are persuaded, and with 
<A NAME="162"></A>reason, to be a symptom of weakness of the stomach; for sometimes when 
<A NAME="163"></A>the very smallest quantity of food has been ingested this does not occur, 
<A NAME="164"></A>owing to the fact that the stomach is contracting accurately upon the food 
<A NAME="165"></A>and constricting it at every point; sometimes when the stomach is full 
<A NAME="166"></A>the gurglings yet make themselves heard as though it were empty. For if 
<A NAME="167"></A>it be in a natural condition, employing its contractile faculty in the 
<A NAME="168"></A>ordinary way, then, even if its contents be very small, it grasps the whole 
<A NAME="169"></A>of them and does not leave any empty space. When it is weak, however, being 
<A NAME="170"></A>unable to lay hold of its contents accurately, it produces a certain amount 
<A NAME="171"></A>of vacant space, and amount of vacant space, and allows the liquid contents 
<A NAME="172"></A>to flow about in different directions in accordance with its changes of 
<A NAME="173"></A>shape, and so to produce gurglings.
<A NAME="174"></A><BR><BR>Thus those who are troubled with this symptom expect, with good 
<A NAME="175"></A>reason, that they will also be unable to digest adequately; proper digestion 
<A NAME="176"></A>cannot take place in a weak stomach. In such people also, the mass of food 
<A NAME="177"></A>may be plainly seen to remain an abnormally long time in the stomach, as 
<A NAME="178"></A>would be natural if their digestion were slow. Indeed, the chief way in 
<A NAME="179"></A>which these people will surprise one is in the length of time that not 
<A NAME="180"></A>food alone but even fluids will remain in their stomachs. Now, the actual 
<A NAME="181"></A>cause of this is not, as one would imagine, that the lower outlet of the 
<A NAME="182"></A>stomach, being fairly narrow, will allow nothing to pass before being reduced 
<A NAME="183"></A>to a fine state of division. There are a great many people who frequently 
<A NAME="184"></A>swallow large quantities of big fruit-stones; one person who was holding 
<A NAME="185"></A>a gold ring in his mouth, inadvertently swallowed it; another swallowed 
<A NAME="186"></A>a coin, and various people have swallowed various hard and indigestible 
<A NAME="187"></A>objects; yet all these people easily passed by the bowel what they had 
<A NAME="188"></A>swallowed, without there being any subsequent symptoms. Now surely if narrowness 
<A NAME="189"></A>of the gastric outlet were the cause of untriturated food remaining for 
<A NAME="190"></A>an abnormally long time, none of these articles I have mentioned would 
<A NAME="191"></A>ever have escaped. Furthermore, the fact that it is liquids which remain 
<A NAME="192"></A>longest in these people's stomachs is sufficient to put the idea of narrowness 
<A NAME="193"></A>of the outlet out of court. For, supposing a rapid descent were dependent 
<A NAME="194"></A>upon emulsification, then soups, milk, and barley-emulsion would at once 
<A NAME="195"></A>pass along in every case. But as a matter of fact this is not so. For in 
<A NAME="196"></A>people who are extremely asthenic it is just these fluids which remain 
<A NAME="197"></A>undigested, which accumulate and produce gurglings, and which oppress and 
<A NAME="198"></A>overload the stomach, whereas in strong persons not merely do none of these 
<A NAME="199"></A>things happen, but even a large quantity of bread or meat passes rapidly 
<A NAME="200"></A>down.
<A NAME="201"></A><BR><BR>And it is not only because the stomach is distended and loaded 
<A NAME="202"></A>and because the fluid runs from one part of it to another accompanied by 
<A NAME="203"></A>gurglings- it is not only for these reasons that one would judge that there 
<A NAME="204"></A>was an unduly long continuance of the food in it, in those people who are 
<A NAME="205"></A>so disposed, but also from the vomiting. Thus, there are some who vomit 
<A NAME="206"></A>up every particle of what they have eaten, not after three or four hours, 
<A NAME="207"></A>but actually in the middle of the night, a lengthy period having elapsed 
<A NAME="208"></A>since their meal.
<A NAME="209"></A><BR><BR>Suppose you fill any animal whatsoever with liquid food- an experiment 
<A NAME="210"></A>I have often carried out in pigs, to whom I give a sort of mess of wheaten 
<A NAME="211"></A>flour and water, there after cutting them open after three or four hours; 
<A NAME="212"></A>if you will do this yourself, you will find the food still in the stomach. 
<A NAME="213"></A>For it is not chylification which determines the length of its stay here- 
<A NAME="214"></A>since this can also be effected outside the stomach; the determining factor 
<A NAME="215"></A>is digestion which is a different thing from chylification, as are blood-production 
<A NAME="216"></A>and nutrition. For, just as it has been shown that these two processes 
<A NAME="217"></A>depend upon a change of qualities, similarly also the digestion of food 
<A NAME="218"></A>in the stomach involves a transmutation of it into the quality proper to 
<A NAME="219"></A>that which is receiving nourishment. Then, when it is completely digested, 
<A NAME="220"></A>the lower outlet opens and the food is quickly ejected through it, even 
<A NAME="221"></A>if there should be amongst it abundance of stones, bones, grape-pips, or 
<A NAME="222"></A>other things which cannot be reduced to chyle. And you may observe this 
<A NAME="223"></A>yourself in an animal, if you will try to hit upon the time at which the 
<A NAME="224"></A>descent of food from the stomach takes place. But even if you should fail 
<A NAME="225"></A>to discover the time, and nothing was yet passing down, and the food was 
<A NAME="226"></A>still undergoing digestion in the stomach, still even then you would find 
<A NAME="227"></A>dissection not without its uses. You will observe, as we have just said, 
<A NAME="228"></A>that the pylorus is accurately closed, and that the whole stomach is in 
<A NAME="229"></A>a state of contraction upon the food very much as the womb contracts upon 
<A NAME="230"></A>the foetus. For it is never possible to find a vacant space in the uterus, 
<A NAME="231"></A>the stomach, or in either of the two bladders- that is, either in that 
<A NAME="232"></A>called bile-receiving or in the other; whether their contents be abundant 
<A NAME="233"></A>or scanty, their cavities are seen to be replete and full, owing to the 
<A NAME="234"></A>fact that their coats contract constantly upon the contents- so long, as 
<A NAME="235"></A>least, as the animal is in a natural condition.
<A NAME="236"></A><BR><BR>Now Erasistratus for some reason declares that it is the contractions 
<A NAME="237"></A>of the stomach which are the cause of everything- that is to say, of the 
<A NAME="238"></A>softening of the food, the removal of waste matter, and the absorption 
<A NAME="239"></A>of the food when chylified [emulsified].
<A NAME="240"></A><BR><BR>Now I have personally, on countless occasions, divided the peritoneum 
<A NAME="241"></A>of a still living animal and have always found all the intestines contracting 
<A NAME="242"></A>peristaltically upon their contents. The condition of the stomach, however, 
<A NAME="243"></A>is found less simple; as regards the substances freshly swallowed, it had 
<A NAME="244"></A>grasped these accurately both above and below, in fact at every point, 
<A NAME="245"></A>and was as devoid of movement as though it had grown round and become united 
<A NAME="246"></A>with the food. At the same time I found the pylorus persistently closed 
<A NAME="247"></A>and accurately shut, like the os uteri on the foetus.
<A NAME="248"></A><BR><BR>In the cases, however, where digestion had been completed the pylorus 
<A NAME="249"></A>had opened, and the stomach was undergoing peristaltic movements, similar 
<A NAME="250"></A>to those of the intestines.
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR>5. Thus all these facts agree that the stomach, uterus, and bladders 
<A NAME="252"></A>possess certain inborn faculties which are retentive of their own proper 
<A NAME="253"></A>qualities and eliminative of those that are foreign. For it has been already 
<A NAME="254"></A>shown that the bladder by the liver draws bile into itself, while it is 
<A NAME="255"></A>also quite obvious that it eliminates this daily into the stomach. Now, 
<A NAME="256"></A>of course, if the eliminative were to succeed the attractive faculty and 
<A NAME="257"></A>there were not a retentive faculty between the two, there would be found, 
<A NAME="258"></A>on every occasion that animals were dissected, an equal quantity of bile 
<A NAME="259"></A>in the gall-bladder. This however, we do not find. For the bladder is sometimes 
<A NAME="260"></A>observed to be very full, sometimes quite empty, while at other times you 
<A NAME="261"></A>find in it various intermediate degrees of fulness, just as is the case 
<A NAME="262"></A>with the other bladder- that which receives the urine; for even without 
<A NAME="263"></A>resorting to anatomy we may observe that the urinary bladder continues 
<A NAME="264"></A>to collect urine up to the time that it becomes uncomfortable through the 
<A NAME="265"></A>increasing quantity of urine or the irritation caused by its acidity- the 
<A NAME="266"></A>presumption thus being that here, too, there is a retentive 
<A NAME="267"></A>faculty.
<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR>Similarly, too, the stomach, when, as often happens, it is irritated 
<A NAME="269"></A>by acidity, gets rid of the food, although still undigested, earlier than 
<A NAME="270"></A>proper; or again, when oppressed by the quantity of its contents, or disordered 
<A NAME="271"></A>from the co-existence of both conditions, it is seized with diarrhoea. 
<A NAME="272"></A>Vomiting also is an affection of the upper [part of the] stomach analogous 
<A NAME="273"></A>to diarrhoea, and it occurs when the stomach is overloaded or is unable 
<A NAME="274"></A>to stand the quality of the food or surplus substances which it contains. 
<A NAME="275"></A>Thus, when such a condition develops in the lower parts of the stomach, 
<A NAME="276"></A>while the parts about the inlet are normal, it ends in diarrhoea, whereas 
<A NAME="277"></A>if this condition is in the upper stomach, the lower parts being normal, 
<A NAME="278"></A>it ends in vomiting.
<A NAME="279"></A><BR><BR>6. This may often be clearly in those who are disinclined for food; 
<A NAME="280"></A>when obliged to eat, they have not the strength to swallow, and, even if 
<A NAME="281"></A>they force themselves to do so, they cannot retain the food, but at vomit 
<A NAME="282"></A>it up. And those especially who have a dislike to some particular kind 
<A NAME="283"></A>of food, sometimes take it under compulsion, and then promptly bring it 
<A NAME="284"></A>up; or, if they force themselves to keep it down, they are nauseated and 
<A NAME="285"></A>feel their stomach turned up, and endeavouring to relieve itself of its 
<A NAME="286"></A>discomfort.
<A NAME="287"></A><BR><BR>Thus, as was said at the beginning, all the observed facts testify 
<A NAME="288"></A>that there must exist in almost all parts of the animal a certain inclination 
<A NAME="289"></A>towards, or, so to speak, an appetite for their own special quality, and 
<A NAME="290"></A>an aversion to, or, as it were, a hatred of the foreign quality. And it 
<A NAME="291"></A>is natural that when they feel an inclination they should attract, and 
<A NAME="292"></A>that when they feel aversion they should expel.
<A NAME="293"></A><BR><BR>From these facts, then, again, both the attractive and the propulsive 
<A NAME="294"></A>faculties have been demonstrated to exist in everything.
<A NAME="295"></A><BR><BR>But if there be an inclination or attraction, there will also be 
<A NAME="296"></A>some benefit derived; for no existing thing attracts anything else for 
<A NAME="297"></A>the mere sake of attracting, but in order to benefit by what is acquired 
<A NAME="298"></A>by the attraction. And of course it cannot benefit by it if it cannot retain 
<A NAME="299"></A>it. Herein, then, again, the retentive faculty is shown to have its necessary 
<A NAME="300"></A>origin: for the stomach obviously inclines towards its own proper qualities 
<A NAME="301"></A>and turns away from those that are foreign to it.
<A NAME="302"></A><BR><BR>But if it aims at and attracts its food and benefits by it while 
<A NAME="303"></A>retaining and contracting upon it, we may also expect that there will be 
<A NAME="304"></A>some termination to the benefit received, and that thereafter will come 
<A NAME="305"></A>the time for the exercise of the eliminative faculty.
<A NAME="306"></A><BR><BR>7. But if the stomach both retains and benefits by its food, then 
<A NAME="307"></A>it employs it for the end for which it [the stomach] naturally exists. 
<A NAME="308"></A>And it exists to partake of that which is of a quality befitting and proper 
<A NAME="309"></A>to it. Thus it attracts all the most useful parts of the food in a vaporous 
<A NAME="310"></A>and finely divided condition, storing this up in its own coats, and applying 
<A NAME="311"></A>it to them. And when it is sufficiently full it puts away from it, as one 
<A NAME="312"></A>might something troublesome, the rest of the food, this having itself meanwhile 
<A NAME="313"></A>obtained some profit from its association with the stomach. For it is impossible 
<A NAME="314"></A>for two bodies which are adapted for acting and being acted upon to come 
<A NAME="315"></A>together without either both acting or being acted upon, or else one acting 
<A NAME="316"></A>and the other being acted upon. For if their forces are equal they will 
<A NAME="317"></A>act and be acted upon equally, and if the one be much superior in strength, 
<A NAME="318"></A>it will exert its activity upon its passive neighbour; thus, while producing 
<A NAME="319"></A>a great and appreciable effect, it will itself be acted upon either little 
<A NAME="320"></A>or not at all. But it is herein also that the main difference lies between 
<A NAME="321"></A>nourishing food and a deleterious drug; the latter masters the forces of 
<A NAME="322"></A>the body, whereas the former is mastered by them.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR><BR>There cannot, then, be food which is suited for the animal which 
<A NAME="324"></A>is not also correspondingly subdued by the qualities existing in the animal. 
<A NAME="325"></A>And to be subdued means to undergo alteration. Now, some parts are stronger 
<A NAME="326"></A>in power and others weaker; therefore, while all will subdue the nutriment 
<A NAME="327"></A>which is proper to the animal, they will not all do so equally. Thus the 
<A NAME="328"></A>stomach will subdue and alter its food, but not to the same extent as will 
<A NAME="329"></A>the liver, veins, arteries, and heart.
<A NAME="330"></A><BR><BR>We must therefore observe to what extent it does alter it. The 
<A NAME="331"></A>alteration is more than that which occurs in the mouth, but less than that 
<A NAME="332"></A>in the liver and veins. For the latter alteration changes the nutriment 
<A NAME="333"></A>into the substance of blood, whereas that in the mouth obviously changes 
<A NAME="334"></A>it into a new form, but certainly does not completely transmute it. This 
<A NAME="335"></A>you may discover in the food which is left in the intervals between the 
<A NAME="336"></A>teeth, and which remains there all night; the bread is not exactly bread, 
<A NAME="337"></A>nor the meat meat, for they have a smell similar to that of the animal's 
<A NAME="338"></A>mouth, and have been disintegrated and dissolved, and have had the qualities 
<A NAME="339"></A>of the animal's flesh impressed upon them. And you may observe the extent 
<A NAME="340"></A>of the alteration which occurs to food in the mouth if you will chew some 
<A NAME="341"></A>corn and then apply it to an unripe [undigested] boil: you will see it 
<A NAME="342"></A>rapidly transmuting- in fact entirely digesting- the boil, though it cannot 
<A NAME="343"></A>do anything of the kind if you mix it with water. And do not let this surprise 
<A NAME="344"></A>you; this phlegm [saliva] in the mouth is also a cure for lichens; it even 
<A NAME="345"></A>rapidly destroys scorpions; while, as regards the animals which emit venom, 
<A NAME="346"></A>some it kills at once, and others after an interval; to all of them in 
<A NAME="347"></A>any case it does great damage. Now, the masticated food is all, firstly, 
<A NAME="348"></A>soaked in and mixed up with this phlegm; and secondly, it is brought into 
<A NAME="349"></A>contact with the actual skin of the mouth; thus it undergoes more change 
<A NAME="350"></A>than the food which is wedged into the vacant spaces between the 
<A NAME="351"></A>teeth.
<A NAME="352"></A><BR><BR>But just as masticated food is more altered than the latter kind, 
<A NAME="353"></A>so is food which has been swallowed more altered than that which has been 
<A NAME="354"></A>merely masticated. Indeed, there is no comparison between these two processes; 
<A NAME="355"></A>we have only to consider what the stomach contains- phlegm, bile, pneuma, 
<A NAME="356"></A>[innate] heat, and, indeed the whole substance of the stomach. And if one 
<A NAME="357"></A>considers along with this the adjacent viscera like a lot of burning hearths 
<A NAME="358"></A>around a great cauldron- to the right the liver, to the left the spleen, 
<A NAME="359"></A>the heart above, and along with it the diaphragm (suspended and in a state 
<A NAME="360"></A>of constant movement), and the omentum sheltering them all- you may believe 
<A NAME="361"></A>what an extraordinary alteration it is which occurs in the food taken into 
<A NAME="362"></A>the stomach.
<A NAME="363"></A><BR><BR>How could it easily become blood if it were not previously prepared 
<A NAME="364"></A>by means of a change of this kind? It has already been shown that nothing 
<A NAME="365"></A>is altered all at once from one quality to its opposite. How then could 
<A NAME="366"></A>bread, beef, beans, or any other food turn into blood if they had not previously 
<A NAME="367"></A>undergone some other alteration? And how could the faeces be generated 
<A NAME="368"></A>right away in the small intestine? For what is there in this organ more 
<A NAME="369"></A>potent in producing alteration than the factors in the stomach? Is it the 
<A NAME="370"></A>number of the coats, or the way it is surrounded by neighbouring viscera, 
<A NAME="371"></A>or the time that the food remains in it, or some kind of innate heat which 
<A NAME="372"></A>it contains? Most assuredly the intestines have the advantage of the stomach 
<A NAME="373"></A>in none of these respects. For what possible reason, then, will objectors 
<A NAME="374"></A>have it that bread may often remain a whole night in the stomach and still 
<A NAME="375"></A>preserve its original qualities, whereas when once it is projected into 
<A NAME="376"></A>the intestines, it straightway becomes ordure? For, if such a long period 
<A NAME="377"></A>of time is incapable of altering it, neither will the short period be sufficient, 
<A NAME="378"></A>or, if the latter is enough, surely the longer time will be much more so! 
<A NAME="379"></A>Well, then, can it be that, while the nutriment does undergo an alteration 
<A NAME="380"></A>in the stomach, this is a different kind of alteration and one which is 
<A NAME="381"></A>not dependent on the nature of the organ which alters it? Or if it be an 
<A NAME="382"></A>alteration of this latter kind, yet one perhaps which is not proper to 
<A NAME="383"></A>the body of the animal? This is still more impossible. Digestion was shown 
<A NAME="384"></A>to be nothing else than an alteration to the quality proper to that which 
<A NAME="385"></A>is receiving nourishment. Since, then, this is what digestion means and 
<A NAME="386"></A>since the nutriment has been shown to take on in the stomach a quality 
<A NAME="387"></A>appropriate to the animal which is about to be nourished by it, it has 
<A NAME="388"></A>been demonstrated adequately that nutriment does undergo digestion in the 
<A NAME="389"></A>stomach.
<A NAME="390"></A><BR><BR>And Asclepiades is absurd when he states that the quality of the 
<A NAME="391"></A>digested food never shows itself either in eructations or in the vomited 
<A NAME="392"></A>matter, or on dissection. For of course the mere fact that the food smells 
<A NAME="393"></A>of the body shows that it has undergone gastric digestion. But this man 
<A NAME="394"></A>is so foolish that, when he hears the Ancients saying that the food is 
<A NAME="395"></A>converted in the stomach into something "good," he thinks it proper to 
<A NAME="396"></A>look out not for what is good in its possible effects, but for what is 
<A NAME="397"></A>good to the taste: this is like saying that apples (for so one has to argue 
<A NAME="398"></A>with him) become more apple-like [in flavour] in the stomach, or honey 
<A NAME="399"></A>more honey-like!
<A NAME="400"></A><BR><BR>Erasistratus, however, is still more foolish and absurd, either 
<A NAME="401"></A>through not perceiving in what sense the Ancients said that digestion is 
<A NAME="402"></A>similar to the process of boiling, or because he purposely confused himself 
<A NAME="403"></A>with sophistries. It is, he says, inconceivable that digestion, involving 
<A NAME="404"></A>as it does such trifling warmth, should be related to the boiling process. 
<A NAME="405"></A>This is as if we were to suppose that it was necessary to put the fires 
<A NAME="406"></A>of Etna under the stomach before it could manage to alter the food; or 
<A NAME="407"></A>else that, while it was capable of altering the food, it did not do this 
<A NAME="408"></A>by virtue of its innate heat, which of course was moist, so that the word 
<A NAME="409"></A>boil was used instead of bake.
<A NAME="410"></A><BR><BR>What he ought to have done, if it was facts that he wished to dispute 
<A NAME="411"></A>about, was to have tried to show, first and foremost, that the food is 
<A NAME="412"></A>not transmuted or altered in quality by the stomach at all, and secondly, 
<A NAME="413"></A>if he could not be confident of this, he ought to have tried to show that 
<A NAME="414"></A>this alteration was not of any advantage to the animal. If, again, he were 
<A NAME="415"></A>unable even to make this misrepresentation, he ought to have attempted 
<A NAME="416"></A>to confute the postulate concerning the active principles- to show, in 
<A NAME="417"></A>fact, that the functions taking place in the various parts do not depend 
<A NAME="418"></A>on the way in which the Warm, Cold, Dry, and Moist are mixed, but on some 
<A NAME="419"></A>other factor. And if he had not the audacity to misrepresent facts even 
<A NAME="420"></A>so far as this, still he should have tried at least to show that the Warm 
<A NAME="421"></A>is not the most active of all the principles which play a part in things 
<A NAME="422"></A>governed by Nature. But if he was unable to demonstrate this any more than 
<A NAME="423"></A>any of the previous propositions, then he ought not to have made himself 
<A NAME="424"></A>ridiculous by quarrelling uselessly with a mere name- as though Aristotle 
<A NAME="425"></A>had not clearly stated in the fourth book of his "Meteorology," as well 
<A NAME="426"></A>as in many other passages, in what way digestion can be said to be allied 
<A NAME="427"></A>to boiling, and also that the latter expression is not used in its primitive 
<A NAME="428"></A>or strict sense.
<A NAME="429"></A><BR><BR>But, as has been frequently said already, the one starting-point 
<A NAME="430"></A>of all this is a thorough-going enquiry into the question of the Warm, 
<A NAME="431"></A>Cold, Dry and Moist; this Aristotle carried out in the second of his books 
<A NAME="432"></A>"On Genesis and Destruction," where he shows that all the transmutations 
<A NAME="433"></A>and alterations throughout the body take place as a result of these principles. 
<A NAME="434"></A>Erasistratus, however, advanced nothing against these or anything else 
<A NAME="435"></A>that has been said above, but occupied himself merely with the word 
<A NAME="436"></A>"boiling."
<A NAME="437"></A><BR><BR>8. Thus, as regards digestion, even though he neglected everything 
<A NAME="438"></A>else, he did at least attempt to prove his point- namely, that digestion 
<A NAME="439"></A>in animals differs from boiling carried on outside; in regard to the question 
<A NAME="440"></A>of deglutition, however, he did not go even so far as this. What are his 
<A NAME="441"></A>words?
<A NAME="442"></A><BR><BR>"The stomach does not appear to exercise any 
<A NAME="443"></A>traction."
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>Now the fact is that the stomach possesses two coats, which certainly 
<A NAME="445"></A>exist for some purpose; they extend as far as the mouth, the internal one 
<A NAME="446"></A>remaining throughout similar to what it is in the stomach, and the other 
<A NAME="447"></A>one tending to become of a more fleshy nature in the gullet. Now simple 
<A NAME="448"></A>observation will testify that these coats have their fibres inserted in 
<A NAME="449"></A>contrary directions. And, although Erasistratus did not attempt to say 
<A NAME="450"></A>for what reason they are like this, I am going to do 
<A NAME="451"></A>so.
<A NAME="452"></A><BR><BR>The inner coat has its fibres straight, since it exists for the 
<A NAME="453"></A>purpose of traction. The outer coat has its fibres transverse, for the 
<A NAME="454"></A>purpose of peristalsis. In fact, the movements of each of the mobile organs 
<A NAME="455"></A>of the body depend on the setting of the fibres. Now please test this assertion 
<A NAME="456"></A>first in the muscles themselves; in these the fibres are most distinct, 
<A NAME="457"></A>and their movements visible owing to their vigour. And after the muscles, 
<A NAME="458"></A>pass to the physical organs, and you will see that they all move in correspondence 
<A NAME="459"></A>with their fibres. This is why the fibres throughout the intestines are 
<A NAME="460"></A>circular in both coats- they only contract peristaltically, they do not 
<A NAME="461"></A>exercise traction. The stomach, again, has some of its fibres longitudinal 
<A NAME="462"></A>for the purpose of traction and the others transverse for the purpose of 
<A NAME="463"></A>peristalsis. For just as the movements in the muscles take place when each 
<A NAME="464"></A>of the fibres becomes tightened and drawn towards its origin, such also 
<A NAME="465"></A>is what happens in the stomach; when the transverse fibres tighten, the 
<A NAME="466"></A>breadth of the cavity contained by them becomes less; and when the longitudinal 
<A NAME="467"></A>fibres contract and draw in upon themselves, the length must necessarily 
<A NAME="468"></A>be curtailed. This curtailment of length, indeed, is well seen in the act 
<A NAME="469"></A>of swallowing: the larynx is seen to rise upwards to exactly the same degree 
<A NAME="470"></A>that the gullet is drawn downwards; while, after the process of swallowing 
<A NAME="471"></A>has been completed and the gullet is released from tension, the larynx 
<A NAME="472"></A>can be clearly seen to again. This is because the inner coat of the stomach, 
<A NAME="473"></A>which has the longitudinal fibres and which also lines the gullet and the 
<A NAME="474"></A>mouth, extends to the interior of the larynx, and it is thus impossible 
<A NAME="475"></A>for it to be drawn down by the stomach without the larynx being involved 
<A NAME="476"></A>in the traction.
<A NAME="477"></A><BR><BR>Further, it will be found acknowledged in Erasistratus's own writings 
<A NAME="478"></A>that the circular fibres (by which the stomach as well as other parts performs 
<A NAME="479"></A>its contractions) do not curtail its length, but contract and lessen its 
<A NAME="480"></A>breadth. For he says that the stomach contracts peristaltically round the 
<A NAME="481"></A>food during the whole period of digestion. But if it contracts, without 
<A NAME="482"></A>in any way being diminished in length, this is because downward traction 
<A NAME="483"></A>of the gullet is not a property of the movement of circular peristalsis. 
<A NAME="484"></A>For what alone happens, as Erasistratus himself said, is that when the 
<A NAME="485"></A>upper parts contract the lower ones dilate. And everyone knows that this 
<A NAME="486"></A>can be plainly seen happening even in a dead man, if water be poured down 
<A NAME="487"></A>his throat; this symptom results from the passage of matter through a narrow 
<A NAME="488"></A>channel; it would be extraordinary if the channel did not dilate when a 
<A NAME="489"></A>mass was passing through it. Obviously then the dilatation of the lower 
<A NAME="490"></A>parts along with the contraction of the upper is common both to dead bodies, 
<A NAME="491"></A>when anything whatsoever is passing through them, and to living ones, whether 
<A NAME="492"></A>they contract peristaltically round their contents or attract 
<A NAME="493"></A>them.
<A NAME="494"></A><BR><BR>Curtailment of length, on the other hand, is peculiar to organs 
<A NAME="495"></A>which possess longitudinal fibres for the purpose of attraction. But the 
<A NAME="496"></A>gullet was shown to be pulled down; for otherwise it would not have drawn 
<A NAME="497"></A>upon the larynx. It is therefore clear that the stomach attracts food by 
<A NAME="498"></A>the gullet.
<A NAME="499"></A><BR><BR>Further, in vomiting, the mere passive conveyance of rejected matter 
<A NAME="500"></A>up to the mouth will certainly itself suffice to keep open those parts 
<A NAME="501"></A>of the oesophagus which are distended by the returned food; as it occupies 
<A NAME="502"></A>each part in front [above], it first dilates this, and of course leaves 
<A NAME="503"></A>the part behind [below] contracted. Thus, in this respect at least, the 
<A NAME="504"></A>condition of the gullet is precisely similar to what it is in the act of 
<A NAME="505"></A>swallowing. But there being no traction, the whole length remains equal 
<A NAME="506"></A>in such cases.
<A NAME="507"></A><BR><BR>And for this reason it is easier to swallow than to vomit, for 
<A NAME="508"></A>deglutition results the coats of the stomach being brought into action, 
<A NAME="509"></A>the inner one exerting a pull and the outer one helping by peristalsis 
<A NAME="510"></A>and propulsion, whereas emesis occurs from the outer coat alone functioning, 
<A NAME="511"></A>without there being any kind of pull towards the mouth. For, although the 
<A NAME="512"></A>swallowing of food is ordinarily preceded by a feeling of desire on the 
<A NAME="513"></A>part of the stomach, there is in the case of vomiting no corresponding 
<A NAME="514"></A>desire from the mouth-parts for the experience; the two are opposite dispositions 
<A NAME="515"></A>of the stomach itself; it yearns after and tends towards what is advantageous 
<A NAME="516"></A>and proper to it, it loathes and rids itself of what is foreign. Thus the 
<A NAME="517"></A>actual process of swallowing occurs very quickly in those who have a good 
<A NAME="518"></A>appetite for such foods as are proper to the stomach; this organ obviously 
<A NAME="519"></A>draws them in and down before they are masticated; whereas in the case 
<A NAME="520"></A>of those who are forced to take a medicinal draught or who take food as 
<A NAME="521"></A>medicine, the swallowing of these articles is accomplished with distress 
<A NAME="522"></A>and difficulty.
<A NAME="523"></A><BR><BR>From what has been said, then, it is clear that the inner coat 
<A NAME="524"></A>of the stomach (that containing longitudinal fibres) exists for the purpose 
<A NAME="525"></A>of exerting a pull the from to stomach, and that it is only in deglutition 
<A NAME="526"></A>that it is active, whereas the external coat, which contains transverse 
<A NAME="527"></A>fibres, has been so constituted in order that it may contract upon its 
<A NAME="528"></A>contents and propel them forward; this coat furthermore, functions in vomiting 
<A NAME="529"></A>no less than in swallowing. The truth of my statement is also borne out 
<A NAME="530"></A>by what happens in the channae and synodonts; the stomachs of these animals 
<A NAME="531"></A>are sometimes found in their mouths, as also Aristotle writes in his "History 
<A NAME="532"></A>of Animals"; he also adds the cause of this: he says that it is owing to 
<A NAME="533"></A>their voracity.
<A NAME="534"></A><BR><BR>The facts are as follows. In all animals, when the appetite is 
<A NAME="535"></A>very intense, the stomach rises up, so that some people who have a clear 
<A NAME="536"></A>perception of this condition say that their stomach "creeps out" of them; 
<A NAME="537"></A>in others, who are still masticating their food and have not yet worked 
<A NAME="538"></A>it up properly in the mouth, the stomach obviously snatches away the food 
<A NAME="539"></A>from them against their will. In those animals, therefore, which are naturally 
<A NAME="540"></A>voracious, in whom the mouth cavity is of generous proportions, and the 
<A NAME="541"></A>stomach situated close to it (as in the case of the synodont and channae), 
<A NAME="542"></A>it is in no way surprising that, when they are sufficiently hungry and 
<A NAME="543"></A>are pursuing one of the smaller animals, and are just on the point of catching 
<A NAME="544"></A>it, the stomach should, under the impulse of desire, spring into the mouth. 
<A NAME="545"></A>And this cannot possibly take place in any other way than by the stomach 
<A NAME="546"></A>drawing the food to itself by means of the gullet, as though by a hand. 
<A NAME="547"></A>In fact, just as we ourselves, in our eagerness to grasp more quickly something 
<A NAME="548"></A>lying before us, sometimes stretch out our whole bodies along with our 
<A NAME="549"></A>hands, so also the stomach stretches itself forward along with the gullet, 
<A NAME="550"></A>which is, as it were, its hand. And thus, in these animals in whom those 
<A NAME="551"></A>three factors co-exist- an excessive propensity for food, a small gullet, 
<A NAME="552"></A>and ample mouth proportions- in these, any slight tendency to movement 
<A NAME="553"></A>forwards brings the whole stomach into the mouth.
<A NAME="554"></A><BR><BR>Now the constitution of the organs might itself suffice to give 
<A NAME="555"></A>a naturalist an indication of their functions. For Nature would never have 
<A NAME="556"></A>purposelessly constructed the oesophagus of two coats with contrary dispositions; 
<A NAME="557"></A>they must also have each been meant to have a different action. The Erasistratean 
<A NAME="558"></A>school, however, are capable of anything rather than of recognizing the 
<A NAME="559"></A>effects of Nature. Come, therefore, let us demonstrate to them by animal 
<A NAME="560"></A>dissection as well that each of the two coats does exercise the activity 
<A NAME="561"></A>which I have stated. Take an animal, then; lay bare the structures surrounding 
<A NAME="562"></A>the gullet, without severing any of the nerves, arteries, or veins which 
<A NAME="563"></A>are there situated; next divide with vertical incisions, from the lower 
<A NAME="564"></A>jaw to the thorax, the outer coat of the oesophagus (that containing transverse 
<A NAME="565"></A>fibres); then give the animal food and you will see that it still swallows 
<A NAME="566"></A>although the peristaltic function has been abolished. If, again, in another 
<A NAME="567"></A>animal, you cut through both coats with transverse incisions, you will 
<A NAME="568"></A>observe that this animal also swallows although the inner coat is no longer 
<A NAME="569"></A>functioning. From this it is clear that the animal can also swallow by 
<A NAME="570"></A>either of the two coats, although not so well as by both. For the following 
<A NAME="571"></A>also, in addition to other points, may be distinctly observed in the dissection 
<A NAME="572"></A>which I have described- that during deglutition the gullet becomes slightly 
<A NAME="573"></A>filled with air which is swallowed along with the food, and that, when 
<A NAME="574"></A>the outer coat is contracting, this air is easily forced with the food 
<A NAME="575"></A>into the stomach, but that, when there only exists an inner coat, the air 
<A NAME="576"></A>impedes the conveyance of food, by distending this coat and hindering its 
<A NAME="577"></A>action.
<A NAME="578"></A><BR><BR>But Erasistratus said nothing about this, nor did he point out 
<A NAME="579"></A>that the oblique situation of the gullet clearly confutes the teaching 
<A NAME="580"></A>of those who hold that it is simply by virtue of the impulse from above 
<A NAME="581"></A>that food which is swallowed reaches the stomach. The only correct thing 
<A NAME="582"></A>he said was that many of the longnecked animals bend down to swallow. Hence, 
<A NAME="583"></A>clearly, the observed fact does not show how we swallow but how we do not 
<A NAME="584"></A>swallow. For from this observation it is clear that swallowing is not due 
<A NAME="585"></A>merely to the impulse from above; it is yet, however, not clear whether 
<A NAME="586"></A>it results from the food being attracted by the stomach, or conducted by 
<A NAME="587"></A>the gullet. For our part, however, having enumerated all the different 
<A NAME="588"></A>considerations- those based on the constitution of the organs, as well 
<A NAME="589"></A>as those based on the other symptoms which, as just mentioned, occur both 
<A NAME="590"></A>before and after the gullet has been exposed- we have thus sufficiently 
<A NAME="591"></A>proved that the inner coast exists for the purpose of attraction and the 
<A NAME="592"></A>outer for the purpose of propulsion.
<A NAME="593"></A><BR><BR>Now the original task we set before ourselves was to demonstrate 
<A NAME="594"></A>that the retentive faculty exists in every one of the organs, just as in 
<A NAME="595"></A>the previous book we proved the existence of the attractive, and, over 
<A NAME="596"></A>and above this, the alterative faculty. Thus, in the natural course of 
<A NAME="597"></A>our argument, we have demonstrated these four faculties existing in the 
<A NAME="598"></A>stomach- the attractive faculty in connection with swallowing, the retentive 
<A NAME="599"></A>with digestion, the expulsive with vomiting and with the descent of digested 
<A NAME="600"></A>food into the small intestine- and digestion itself we have shown to be 
<A NAME="601"></A>a process of alteration.
<A NAME="602"></A><BR><BR>9. Concerning the spleen, also, we shall therefore have no further 
<A NAME="603"></A>doubts as to whether it attracts what is proper to it, rejects what is 
<A NAME="604"></A>foreign, and has a natural power of altering and retaining all that it 
<A NAME="605"></A>attracts; nor shall we be in any doubt as to the liver, veins, arteries, 
<A NAME="606"></A>heart, or any other organ. For these four faculties have been shown to 
<A NAME="607"></A>be necessary for every part which is to be nourished; this is why we have 
<A NAME="608"></A>called these faculties the handmaids of nutrition. For just as human faeces 
<A NAME="609"></A>are most pleasing to dogs, so the residual matters from the liver are, 
<A NAME="610"></A>some of them, proper to the spleen, others to the gall-bladder, and others 
<A NAME="611"></A>to the kidneys.
<A NAME="612"></A><BR><BR>10. I should not have cared to say anything further as to the origin 
<A NAME="613"></A>of these [surplus substances] after Hippocrates, Plato, Aristotle, Diocles, 
<A NAME="614"></A>Praxagoras, and Philotimus, nor indeed should I even have said anything 
<A NAME="615"></A>about the faculties, if any of our predecessors had worked out this subject 
<A NAME="616"></A>thoroughly.
<A NAME="617"></A><BR><BR>While, however, the statements which the Ancients made on these 
<A NAME="618"></A>points were correct, they yet omitted to defend their arguments with logical 
<A NAME="619"></A>proofs; of course they never suspected that there could be sophists so 
<A NAME="620"></A>shameless as to try to contradict obvious facts. More recent physicians, 
<A NAME="621"></A>again, have been partly conquered by the sophistries of these fellows and 
<A NAME="622"></A>have given credence to them; whilst others who attempted to argue with 
<A NAME="623"></A>them appear to me to lack to a great extent the power of the Ancients. 
<A NAME="624"></A>For this reason I have attempted to put together my arguments in the way 
<A NAME="625"></A>in which it seems to me the Ancients, had any of them been still alive, 
<A NAME="626"></A>would have done, in opposition to those who would overturn the finest doctrines 
<A NAME="627"></A>of our art.
<A NAME="628"></A><BR><BR>I am not, however, unaware that I shall achieve either nothing 
<A NAME="629"></A>at all or else very little. For I find that a great many things which have 
<A NAME="630"></A>been conclusively demonstrated by the Ancients are unintelligible to the 
<A NAME="631"></A>bulk of the Moderns owing to their ignorance- nay, that, by reason of their 
<A NAME="632"></A>laziness, they will not even make an attempt to comprehend them; and even 
<A NAME="633"></A>if any of them have understood them, they have not given them impartial 
<A NAME="634"></A>examination.
<A NAME="635"></A><BR><BR>The fact is that he whose purpose is to know anything better than 
<A NAME="636"></A>the multitude do must far surpass all others both as regards his nature 
<A NAME="637"></A>and his early training. And when he reaches early adolescence he must become 
<A NAME="638"></A>possessed with an ardent love for truth, like one inspired; neither day 
<A NAME="639"></A>nor night may he cease to urge and strain himself in order to learn thoroughly 
<A NAME="640"></A>all that has been said by the most illustrious of the Ancients. And when 
<A NAME="641"></A>he has learnt this, then for a prolonged period he must test and prove 
<A NAME="642"></A>it, observing what part of it is in agreement, and what in disagreement 
<A NAME="643"></A>with obvious fact; thus he will choose this and turn away from that. To 
<A NAME="644"></A>such an one my hope has been that my treatise would prove of the very greatest 
<A NAME="645"></A>assistance.... Still, such people may be expected to be quite few in number, 
<A NAME="646"></A>while, as for the others, this book will be as superfluous to them as a 
<A NAME="647"></A>tale told to an ass.
<A NAME="648"></A><BR><BR>11. For the sake, then, of those who are aiming at truth, we must 
<A NAME="649"></A>complete this treatise by adding what is still wanting in it. Now, in people 
<A NAME="650"></A>who are very hungry, the stomach obviously attracts or draws down the food 
<A NAME="651"></A>before it has been thoroughly softened in the mouth, whilst in those who 
<A NAME="652"></A>have no appetite or who are being forced to eat, the stomach is displeased 
<A NAME="653"></A>and rejects the food. And in a similar way of the other organs possesses 
<A NAME="654"></A>both faculties- that of attracting what is proper to it, and that of rejecting 
<A NAME="655"></A>what is foreign. Thus, even if there be any organ which consists of only 
<A NAME="656"></A>one coat (such as the two bladders, the uterus, and the veins), it yet 
<A NAME="657"></A>possesses both kinds of fibres, the longitudinal and the 
<A NAME="658"></A>transverse.
<A NAME="659"></A><BR><BR>But further, there are fibres of a third kind- the oblique- which 
<A NAME="660"></A>are much fewer in number than the two kinds already spoken of. In the organs 
<A NAME="661"></A>consisting of two coats this kind of fibre is found in the one coat only, 
<A NAME="662"></A>mixed with the longitudinal fibres; but in the organs composed of one coat 
<A NAME="663"></A>it is found along with the other two kinds. Now, these are of the greatest 
<A NAME="664"></A>help to the action of the faculty which we have named retentive. For during 
<A NAME="665"></A>this period the part needs to be tightly contracted and stretched over 
<A NAME="666"></A>its contents at every point- the stomach during the whole period of digestion, 
<A NAME="667"></A>and the uterus during that of gestation.
<A NAME="668"></A><BR><BR>Thus too, the coat of a vein, being single, consists of various 
<A NAME="669"></A>kinds of fibres; whilst the outer coat of an artery consists of circular 
<A NAME="670"></A>fibres, and its inner coat mostly of longitudinal fibres, but with a few 
<A NAME="671"></A>oblique ones also amongst them. Veins thus resemble the uterus or the bladder 
<A NAME="672"></A>as regards the arrangement of their fibres, even though they are deficient 
<A NAME="673"></A>in thickness; similarly arteries resemble the stomach. Alone of all organs 
<A NAME="674"></A>the intestines consist of two coats of which both have their fibres transverse. 
<A NAME="675"></A>Now the proof that it was for the best that all the organs should be naturally 
<A NAME="676"></A>such as they are (that, for instance, the intestines should be composed 
<A NAME="677"></A>of two coats) belongs to the subject of the use of parts; thus we must 
<A NAME="678"></A>not now desire to hear about matters of this kind nor why the anatomists 
<A NAME="679"></A>are at variance regarding the number of coats in each organ. For these 
<A NAME="680"></A>questions have been sufficiently discussed in the treatise "On Disagreement 
<A NAME="681"></A>in Anatomy." And the problem as to why each organ has such and such a character 
<A NAME="682"></A>will be discussed in the treatise "On the Use of Parts."
<A NAME="683"></A><BR><BR>12. It is not, however, our business to discuss either of these 
<A NAME="684"></A>questions here, but to consider duly the natural faculties, which, to the 
<A NAME="685"></A>number of four, exist in each organ. Returning then, to this point, let 
<A NAME="686"></A>us recall what has already been said, and set a crown to the whole subject 
<A NAME="687"></A>by adding what is still wanting. For when every part of the animal has 
<A NAME="688"></A>been shewn to draw into itself the juice which is proper to it (this being 
<A NAME="689"></A>practically the first of the natural faculties), the next point to realise 
<A NAME="690"></A>is that the part does not get rid either of this attracted nutriment as 
<A NAME="691"></A>a whole, or even of any superfluous portion of it, until either the organ 
<A NAME="692"></A>itself, or the major part of its contents also have their condition reversed. 
<A NAME="693"></A>Thus, when the stomach is sufficiently filled with the food and has absorbed 
<A NAME="694"></A>and stored away the most useful part of it in its own coats, it then rejects 
<A NAME="695"></A>the rest like an alien burden. The same happens to the bladders, when the 
<A NAME="696"></A>matter attracted into them begins to give trouble either because it distends 
<A NAME="697"></A>them through its quantity or irritates them by its quality.
<A NAME="698"></A><BR><BR>And this also happens in the case of the uterus; for it is either 
<A NAME="699"></A>because it can no longer bear to be stretched that it strives to relieve 
<A NAME="700"></A>itself of its annoyance, or else because it is irritated by the quality 
<A NAME="701"></A>of the fluids poured out into it. Now both of these conditions sometimes 
<A NAME="702"></A>occur with actual violence, and then miscarriage takes place. But for the 
<A NAME="703"></A>most part they happen in a normal way, this being then called not miscarriage 
<A NAME="704"></A>but delivery or parturition. Now abortifacient drugs or certain other conditions 
<A NAME="705"></A>which destroy the embryo or rupture certain of its membranes are followed 
<A NAME="706"></A>by abortion, and similarly also when the uterus is in pain from being in 
<A NAME="707"></A>a bad state of tension; and, as has been well said by Hippocrates, excessive 
<A NAME="708"></A>movement on the part of the embryo itself brings on labour. Now pain is 
<A NAME="709"></A>common to all these conditions, and of this there are three possible causes- 
<A NAME="710"></A>either excessive bulk, or weight, or irritation; bulk when the uterus can 
<A NAME="711"></A>no longer support the stretching, weight when the contents surpass its 
<A NAME="712"></A>strength, and irritation when the fluids which had previously been pent 
<A NAME="713"></A>up in the membranes, flow out, on the rupture of these, into the uterus 
<A NAME="714"></A>itself, or else when the whole foetus perishes, putrefies, and is resolved 
<A NAME="715"></A>into pernicious ichors, and so irritates and bites the coat of the 
<A NAME="716"></A>uterus.
<A NAME="717"></A><BR><BR>In all organs, then, both their natural effects and their disorders 
<A NAME="718"></A>and maladies plainly take place on analogous lines, some so clearly and 
<A NAME="719"></A>manifestly as to need no demonstration, and others less plainly, although 
<A NAME="720"></A>not entirely unrecognizable to those who are willing to pay 
<A NAME="721"></A>attention.
<A NAME="722"></A><BR><BR>Thus, to take the case of the stomach: the irritation is evident 
<A NAME="723"></A>here because this organ possesses most sensibility, and among its other 
<A NAME="724"></A>affections those producing nausea and the so-called heartburn clearly demonstrate 
<A NAME="725"></A>the eliminative faculty which expels foreign matter. So also in the case 
<A NAME="726"></A>of the uterus and the urinary bladder; this latter also may be plainly 
<A NAME="727"></A>observed to receive and accumulate fluid until it is so stretched by the 
<A NAME="728"></A>amount of this as to be incapable of enduring the pain; or it may be the 
<A NAME="729"></A>quality of the urine which irritates it; for every superfluous substance 
<A NAME="730"></A>which lingers in the body must obviously putrefy, some in a shorter, and 
<A NAME="731"></A>some in a longer time, and thus it becomes pungent, acrid, and burdensome 
<A NAME="732"></A>to the organ which contains it. This does not apply, however, in the case 
<A NAME="733"></A>of the bladder alongside the liver, whence it is clear that it possesses 
<A NAME="734"></A>fewer nerves than do the other organs. Here too, however, at least the 
<A NAME="735"></A>physiologist must discover an analogy. For since it was shown that the 
<A NAME="736"></A>gall-bladder attracts its own special juice, so as to be often found full, 
<A NAME="737"></A>and that it discharges it soon after, this desire to discharge must be 
<A NAME="738"></A>either due to the fact that it is burdened by the quantity or that the 
<A NAME="739"></A>bile has changed in quality to pungent and acrid. For while food does not 
<A NAME="740"></A>change its original quality so fast that it is already ordure as soon as 
<A NAME="741"></A>it falls into the small intestine, on the other hand the bile even more 
<A NAME="742"></A>readily than the urine becomes altered in quality as soon as ever it leaves 
<A NAME="743"></A>the veins, and rapidly undergoes change and putrefaction. Now, if there 
<A NAME="744"></A>be clear evidence in relation to the uterus, stomach, and intestines, as 
<A NAME="745"></A>well as to the urinary bladder, that there is either some distention, irritation, 
<A NAME="746"></A>or burden inciting each of these organs to elimination, there is no difficulty 
<A NAME="747"></A>in imagining this in the case of the gall-bladder also, as well as in the 
<A NAME="748"></A>other organs,- to which obviously the arteries and veins also 
<A NAME="749"></A>belong.
<A NAME="750"></A><BR><BR>13. Nor is there any further difficulty in ascertaining that it 
<A NAME="751"></A>is through the same channel that both attraction and discharge take place 
<A NAME="752"></A>at different times. For obviously the inlet to the stomach does not merely 
<A NAME="753"></A>conduct food and drink into this organ, but in the condition of nausea 
<A NAME="754"></A>it performs the neck of the bladder which is beside the liver, albeit single, 
<A NAME="755"></A>both fills and empties the bladder. Similarly the canal of the uterus affords 
<A NAME="756"></A>an entrance to the semen and an exit to the foetus.
<A NAME="757"></A><BR><BR>But in this latter case, again, whilst the eliminative faculty 
<A NAME="758"></A>is evident, the attractive faculty is not so obvious to most people. It 
<A NAME="759"></A>is, however, the cervix which Hippocrates blames for inertia of the uterus 
<A NAME="760"></A>when he says:- "Its orifice has no power of attracting 
<A NAME="761"></A>semen."
<A NAME="762"></A><BR><BR>Erasistratus, however, and Asclepiades reached such heights of 
<A NAME="763"></A>wisdom that they deprived not merely the stomach and the womb of this faculty 
<A NAME="764"></A>but also the bladder by the liver, and the kidneys as well. I have, however, 
<A NAME="765"></A>pointed out in the first book that it is impossible to assign any other 
<A NAME="766"></A>cause for the secretion of urine or bile.
<A NAME="767"></A><BR><BR>Now, when we find that the uterus, the stomach and the bladder 
<A NAME="768"></A>by the liver carry out attraction and expulsion through one and the same 
<A NAME="769"></A>duct, we need no longer feel surprised that Nature should also frequently 
<A NAME="770"></A>discharge waste-substances into the stomach through the veins. Still less 
<A NAME="771"></A>need we be astonished if a certain amount of the food should, during long 
<A NAME="772"></A>fasts, be drawn back from the liver into the stomach through the same veins 
<A NAME="773"></A>by which it was yielded up to the liver during absorption of nutriment. 
<A NAME="774"></A>To disbelieve such things would of course be like refusing to believe that 
<A NAME="775"></A>purgative drugs draw their appropriate humours from all over the body by 
<A NAME="776"></A>the same stomata through which absorption previously takes place, and to 
<A NAME="777"></A>look for separate stomata for absorption and purgation respectively. As 
<A NAME="778"></A>a matter of fact one and the same stoma subserves two distinct faculties, 
<A NAME="779"></A>and these exercise their pull at different times in opposite directions- 
<A NAME="780"></A>first it subserves the pull of the liver and, during catharsis, that of 
<A NAME="781"></A>the drug. What is there surprising, then, in the fact that the veins situated 
<A NAME="782"></A>between the liver and the region of the stomach fulfil a double service 
<A NAME="783"></A>or purpose? Thus, when there is abundance of nutriment contained in the 
<A NAME="784"></A>food-canal, it is carried up to the liver by the veins mentioned; and when 
<A NAME="785"></A>the canal is empty and in need of nutriment, this is again attracted from 
<A NAME="786"></A>the liver by the same veins.
<A NAME="787"></A><BR><BR>For everything appears to attract from and to go shares with everything 
<A NAME="788"></A>else, and, as the most divine Hippocrates has said, there would seem to 
<A NAME="789"></A>be a consensus in the movements of fluids and vapours. Thus the stronger 
<A NAME="790"></A>draws and the weaker is evacuated.
<A NAME="791"></A><BR><BR>Now, one part is weaker or stronger than another either absolutely, 
<A NAME="792"></A>by nature, and in all cases, or else it becomes so in such and such a particular 
<A NAME="793"></A>instance. Thus, by nature and in all men alike, the heart is stronger than 
<A NAME="794"></A>the liver at attracting what is serviceable to it and rejecting what is 
<A NAME="795"></A>not so; similarly the liver is stronger than the intestines and stomach, 
<A NAME="796"></A>and the arteries than the veins. In each of us personally, however, liver 
<A NAME="797"></A>has stronger drawing power at one time, and the stomach at another. For 
<A NAME="798"></A>when there is much nutriment contained in the alimentary canal and the 
<A NAME="799"></A>appetite and craving of the liver is violent, then the viscus exerts far 
<A NAME="800"></A>the strongest traction. Again, when the liver is full and distended and 
<A NAME="801"></A>the stomach empty and in need, then the force of the traction shifts to 
<A NAME="802"></A>the latter.
<A NAME="803"></A><BR><BR>Suppose we had some food in our hands and were snatching it from 
<A NAME="804"></A>one another; if we were equally in want, the stronger would be likely to 
<A NAME="805"></A>prevail, but if he had satisfied his appetite, and was holding what was 
<A NAME="806"></A>over carelessly, or was anxious to share it with somebody, and if the weaker 
<A NAME="807"></A>was excessively desirous of it, there would be nothing to prevent the latter 
<A NAME="808"></A>from getting it all. In a similar manner the stomach easily attracts nutriment 
<A NAME="809"></A>from the liver when it [the stomach] has a sufficiently strong craving 
<A NAME="810"></A>for it, and the appetite of the viscus is satisfied. And sometimes the 
<A NAME="811"></A>surplusage of nutriment in the liver is a reason why the animal is not 
<A NAME="812"></A>hungry; for when the stomach has better and more available food it requires 
<A NAME="813"></A>nothing from extraneous sources, but if ever it is in need and is at a 
<A NAME="814"></A>loss how to supply the need, it becomes filled with waste-matters; these 
<A NAME="815"></A>are certain biliary, phlegmatic [mucous] and serous fluids, and are the 
<A NAME="816"></A>only substances that the liver yields in response to the traction of the 
<A NAME="817"></A>stomach, on the occasions when the latter too is in want of 
<A NAME="818"></A>nutriment.
<A NAME="819"></A><BR><BR>Now, just as the parts draw food from each other, so also they 
<A NAME="820"></A>sometimes deposit their excess substances in each other, and just as the 
<A NAME="821"></A>stronger prevailed when the two were exercising traction, so it is also 
<A NAME="822"></A>when they are depositing; this is the cause of the so-called fluxions, 
<A NAME="823"></A>for every part has a definite inborn tension, by virtue of which it expels 
<A NAME="824"></A>its superfluities, and, therefore, when one of these parts,- owing, of 
<A NAME="825"></A>course, to some special condition- becomes weaker, there will necessarily 
<A NAME="826"></A>be a confluence into it of the superfluities from all the other parts. 
<A NAME="827"></A>The strongest part deposits its surplus matter in all the parts near it; 
<A NAME="828"></A>these again in other parts which are weaker; these next into yet others; 
<A NAME="829"></A>and this goes on for a long time, until the superfluity, being driven from 
<A NAME="830"></A>one part into another, comes to rest in one of the weakest of all; it cannot 
<A NAME="831"></A>flow from this into another part, because none of the stronger ones will 
<A NAME="832"></A>receive it, while the affected part is unable to drive it 
<A NAME="833"></A>away.
<A NAME="834"></A><BR><BR>When, however, we come to deal again with the origin and cure of 
<A NAME="835"></A>disease, it will be possible to find there also abundant proofs of all 
<A NAME="836"></A>that we have correctly indicated in this book. For the present, however, 
<A NAME="837"></A>let us resume again the task that lay before us, i.e. to show that there 
<A NAME="838"></A>is nothing surprising in nutriment coming from the liver to the intestines 
<A NAME="839"></A>and stomach by way of the very veins through which it had previously been 
<A NAME="840"></A>yielded up from these organs into the liver. And in many people who have 
<A NAME="841"></A>suddenly and completely given up active exercise, or who have had a limb 
<A NAME="842"></A>cut off, there occurs at certain periods an evacuation of blood by way 
<A NAME="843"></A>of the intestines- as Hippocrates has also pointed out somewhere. This 
<A NAME="844"></A>causes no further trouble but sharply purges the whole body and evacuates 
<A NAME="845"></A>the plethoras; the passage of the superfluities is effected, of course, 
<A NAME="846"></A>through the same veins by which absorption took place.
<A NAME="847"></A><BR><BR>Frequently also in disease Nature purges the animal through these 
<A NAME="848"></A>same veins- although in this case the discharge is not sanguineous, but 
<A NAME="849"></A>corresponds to the humour which is at fault. Thus in cholera the entire 
<A NAME="850"></A>body is evacuated by way of the veins leading to the intestines and 
<A NAME="851"></A>stomach.
<A NAME="852"></A><BR><BR>To imagine that matter of different kinds is carried in one direction 
<A NAME="853"></A>only would characterise a man who was entirely ignorant of all the natural 
<A NAME="854"></A>faculties, and particularly of the eliminative faculty, which is the opposite 
<A NAME="855"></A>of the attractive. For opposite movements of matter, active and passive, 
<A NAME="856"></A>must necessarily follow opposite faculties; that is to say, every part, 
<A NAME="857"></A>after it has attracted its special nutrient juice and has retained and 
<A NAME="858"></A>taken the benefit of it hastens to get rid of all the surplusage as quickly 
<A NAME="859"></A>and effectively as possible, and this it does in accordance with the mechanical 
<A NAME="860"></A>tendency of this surplus matter.
<A NAME="861"></A><BR><BR>Hence the stomach clears away by vomiting those superfluities which 
<A NAME="862"></A>come to the surface of its contents, whilst the sediment it clears away 
<A NAME="863"></A>by diarrhoea. And when the animal becomes sick, this means that the stomach 
<A NAME="864"></A>is striving to be evacuated by vomiting. And the expulsive faculty has 
<A NAME="865"></A>in it so violent and forcible an element that in cases of ileus [volvulus], 
<A NAME="866"></A>when the lower exit is completely closed, vomiting of faeces occurs; yet 
<A NAME="867"></A>such surplus matter could not be emitted from the mouth without having 
<A NAME="868"></A>first traversed the whole of the small intestine, the jejunum, the pylorus, 
<A NAME="869"></A>the stomach, and the oesophagus. What is there to wonder at, then, if something 
<A NAME="870"></A>should also be transferred from the extreme skin-surface and so reach the 
<A NAME="871"></A>intestines and stomach? This also was pointed out to us by Hippocrates, 
<A NAME="872"></A>who maintained that not merely pneuma or excess-matter, but actual nutriment 
<A NAME="873"></A>is brought down from the outer surface to the original place from which 
<A NAME="874"></A>it was taken up. For the slightest mechanical movements determine this 
<A NAME="875"></A>expulsive faculty, which apparently acts through the transverse fibres, 
<A NAME="876"></A>and which is very rapidly transmitted from the source of motion to the 
<A NAME="877"></A>opposite extremities. It is, therefore, neither unlikely nor impossible 
<A NAME="878"></A>that, when the part adjoining the skin becomes suddenly oppressed by an 
<A NAME="879"></A>unwonted cold, it should at once be weakened and should find that the liquid 
<A NAME="880"></A>previously deposited beside it without discomfort had now become more of 
<A NAME="881"></A>a burden than a source of nutrition, and should therefore strive to put 
<A NAME="882"></A>it away. Finally, seeing that the passage outwards was shut off by the 
<A NAME="883"></A>condensation [of tissue], it would turn to the remaining exit and would 
<A NAME="884"></A>thus forcibly expel all the waste-matter at once into the adjacent part; 
<A NAME="885"></A>this would do the same to the part following it; and the process would 
<A NAME="886"></A>not cease until the transference finally terminated at the inner of the 
<A NAME="887"></A>veins.
<A NAME="888"></A><BR><BR>Now, movements like these come to an end fairly soon, but those 
<A NAME="889"></A>resulting from internal irritants (e.g., in the administration of purgative 
<A NAME="890"></A>drugs or in cholera) become much stronger and more lasting; they persist 
<A NAME="891"></A>as long as the condition of things about the mouths of the veins continues, 
<A NAME="892"></A>that is, so long as these continue to attract what is adjacent. For this 
<A NAME="893"></A>condition causes evacuation of the contiguous part, and that again of the 
<A NAME="894"></A>part next to it, and this never stops until the extreme surface is reached; 
<A NAME="895"></A>thus, as each part keeps passing on matter to its neighbour, the original 
<A NAME="896"></A>affection very quickly arrives at the extreme termination. Now this is 
<A NAME="897"></A>also the case in ileus; the inflamed intestine is unable to support either 
<A NAME="898"></A>the weight or the acridity of the waste substances and so does its best 
<A NAME="899"></A>to excrete them, in fact to drive them as far away as possible. And, being 
<A NAME="900"></A>prevented from effecting an expulsion downwards when the severest part 
<A NAME="901"></A>of the inflammation is there, it expels the matter into the adjoining part 
<A NAME="902"></A>of the intestines situated above. Thus the tendency of the eliminative 
<A NAME="903"></A>faculty is step by step upwards, until the superfluities reach the 
<A NAME="904"></A>mouth.
<A NAME="905"></A><BR><BR>Now this will be also spoken of at greater length in my treatise 
<A NAME="906"></A>on disease. For the present, however, I think I have shown clearly that 
<A NAME="907"></A>there is a universal conveyance or transference from one thing into another, 
<A NAME="908"></A>and that, as Hippocrates used to say, there exists in everything a consensus 
<A NAME="909"></A>in the movement of air and fluids. And I do not think that anyone, however 
<A NAME="910"></A>slow his intellect, will now be at a loss to understand any of these points,- 
<A NAME="911"></A>how, for instance, the stomach or intestines get nourished, or in what 
<A NAME="912"></A>manner anything makes its way inwards from the outer surface of the body. 
<A NAME="913"></A>Seeing that all parts have the faculty of attracting what is suitable or 
<A NAME="914"></A>well-disposed and of eliminating what is troublesome or irritating, it 
<A NAME="915"></A>is not surprising that opposite movements should occur in them consecutively- 
<A NAME="916"></A>as may be clearly seen in the case of the heart, in the various arteries, 
<A NAME="917"></A>in the thorax, and lungs. In all these the active movements of the organs 
<A NAME="918"></A>and therewith the passive movements of [their contained] matters may be 
<A NAME="919"></A>seen taking place almost every second in opposite directions. Now, you 
<A NAME="920"></A>are not astonished when the trachea-artery alternately draws air into the 
<A NAME="921"></A>lungs and gives it out, and when the nostrils and the whole mouth act similarly; 
<A NAME="922"></A>nor do you think it strange or paradoxical that the air is dismissed through 
<A NAME="923"></A>the very channel by which it was admitted just before. Do you, then, feel 
<A NAME="924"></A>a difficulty in the case of the veins which pass down from the liver into 
<A NAME="925"></A>the stomach and intestines, and do you think it strange that nutriment 
<A NAME="926"></A>should at once be yielded up to the liver and drawn back from it into the 
<A NAME="927"></A>stomach by the same veins? You must define what you mean by this expression 
<A NAME="928"></A>"at once." If you mean "at the same time" this is not what we ourselves 
<A NAME="929"></A>say; for just as we take in a breath at one moment and give it out again 
<A NAME="930"></A>at another, so at one time the liver draws nutriment from the stomach, 
<A NAME="931"></A>and at another the stomach from the liver. But if your expression "at once" 
<A NAME="932"></A>means that in one and the same animal a single organ subserves the transport 
<A NAME="933"></A>of matter in opposite directions, and if it is this which disturbs you, 
<A NAME="934"></A>consider inspiration and expiration. For of course these also take place 
<A NAME="935"></A>through the same organs, albeit they differ in their manner of movement, 
<A NAME="936"></A>and in the way in which the matter is conveyed through 
<A NAME="937"></A>them.
<A NAME="938"></A><BR><BR>Now the lungs, the thorax, the arteries rough and smooth, the heart, 
<A NAME="939"></A>the mouth, and the nostrils reverse their movements at very short intervals 
<A NAME="940"></A>and change the direction of the matters they contain. On the other hand, 
<A NAME="941"></A>the veins which pass down the from the liver to the intestines and stomach 
<A NAME="942"></A>reverse the direction not at such short intervals, but sometimes once in 
<A NAME="943"></A>many days.
<A NAME="944"></A><BR><BR>The whole matter, in fact, is as follows:- Each of the organs draws 
<A NAME="945"></A>into itself the nutriment alongside it, and devours all the useful fluid 
<A NAME="946"></A>in it, until it is thoroughly satisfied; this nutriment, as I have already 
<A NAME="947"></A>shown, it stores up in itself, afterwards making it adhere and then assimilating 
<A NAME="948"></A>it- that is, it becomes nourished by it. For it has been demonstrated with 
<A NAME="949"></A>sufficient clearness already that there is something which necessarily 
<A NAME="950"></A>precedes actual nutrition, namely adhesion, and that before this again 
<A NAME="951"></A>comes presentation. Thus as in the case of the animals themselves the end 
<A NAME="952"></A>of eating is that the stomach should be filled, similarly in the case of 
<A NAME="953"></A>each of the parts, the end of presentation is the filling of this part 
<A NAME="954"></A>with its appropriate liquid. Since, therefore, every part has, like the 
<A NAME="955"></A>stomach, a craving to be nourished, it too envelops its nutriment and clasps 
<A NAME="956"></A>it all round as the stomach does. And this [action of the stomach], as 
<A NAME="957"></A>has been already said, is necessarily followed by the digestion of the 
<A NAME="958"></A>food, although it is not to make it suitable for the other parts that the 
<A NAME="959"></A>stomach contracts upon it; if it did so, it would no longer be a physiological 
<A NAME="960"></A>organ, but an animal possessing reason and intelligence, with the power 
<A NAME="961"></A>of choosing the better [of two alternatives].
<A NAME="962"></A><BR><BR>But while the stomach contracts for the reason that the whole body 
<A NAME="963"></A>possesses a power of attracting and of utilising appropriate qualities, 
<A NAME="964"></A>as has already been explained, it also happens that, in this process, the 
<A NAME="965"></A>food undergoes alteration; further, when filled and saturated with the 
<A NAME="966"></A>fluid pabulum from the food, it thereafter looks on the food as a burden; 
<A NAME="967"></A>thus it at once gets of the excess- that is to say, drives it gets downwards- 
<A NAME="968"></A>itself turning to another task, namely that of causing adhesion. And during 
<A NAME="969"></A>this time, while the nutriment is passing along the whole length of the 
<A NAME="970"></A>intestine, it is caught up by the vessels which pass into the intestine; 
<A NAME="971"></A>as we shall shortly demonstrate, most of it is seized by the veins, but 
<A NAME="972"></A>a little also by the arteries; at this stage also it becomes presented 
<A NAME="973"></A>to the coats of the intestines.
<A NAME="974"></A><BR><BR>Now imagine the whole economy of nutrition divided into three periods. 
<A NAME="975"></A>Suppose that in the first period the nutriment remains in the stomach and 
<A NAME="976"></A>is digested and presented to the stomach until satiety is reached, also 
<A NAME="977"></A>that some of it is taken up from the stomach to the 
<A NAME="978"></A>liver.
<A NAME="979"></A><BR><BR>During the second period it passes along the intestines and becomes 
<A NAME="980"></A>presented both to them and to the liver- again until the stage of satiety- 
<A NAME="981"></A>while a small part of it is carried all over the body. During this period, 
<A NAME="982"></A>also imagine that what was presented to the stomach in the first period 
<A NAME="983"></A>becomes now adherent to it.
<A NAME="984"></A><BR><BR>During the third period the stomach has reached the stage of receiving 
<A NAME="985"></A>nourishment; it now entirely assimilates everything that had become adherent 
<A NAME="986"></A>to it: at the same time in the intestines and liver there takes place adhesion 
<A NAME="987"></A>of what had been before presented, while dispersal [anadosis] is taking 
<A NAME="988"></A>place to all parts of the body, as also presentation. Now, if the animal 
<A NAME="989"></A>takes food immediately after these [three stages] then, during the time 
<A NAME="990"></A>that the stomach is again digesting and getting the benefit of this by 
<A NAME="991"></A>presenting all the useful part of it to its own coats, the intestines will 
<A NAME="992"></A>be engaged in final assimilation of the juices which have adhered to them, 
<A NAME="993"></A>and so also will the liver: while in the various parts of the body there 
<A NAME="994"></A>will be taking place adhesion of the portions of nutriment presented. And 
<A NAME="995"></A>if the stomach is forced to remain without food during this time, it will 
<A NAME="996"></A>draw its nutriment the from the veins in the mesentery and liver; for it 
<A NAME="997"></A>will not do so from the actual body of the liver (by body of the liver 
<A NAME="998"></A>I mean first and foremost its flesh proper, and after this all the vessels 
<A NAME="999"></A>contained in it), for it is irrational to suppose that one part would draw 
<A NAME="1000"></A>away from another part the juice already contained in it, especially when 
<A NAME="1001"></A>adhesion and final assimilation of that juice were already taking place; 
<A NAME="1002"></A>the juice, however, that is in the cavity of the veins will be abstracted 
<A NAME="1003"></A>by the part which is stronger and more in need.
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR><BR>It is in this way, therefore, that the stomach, when it is in need 
<A NAME="1005"></A>of nourishment and the animal has nothing to eat, seizes it from the veins 
<A NAME="1006"></A>in the liver. Also in the case of the spleen we have shown in a former 
<A NAME="1007"></A>passage how it draws all material from the liver that tends to be thick, 
<A NAME="1008"></A>and by working it up converts it into more useful matter. There is nothing 
<A NAME="1009"></A>surprising, therefore, if, in the present instance also, some of this should 
<A NAME="1010"></A>be drawn from the spleen into such organs as communicate with it by veins, 
<A NAME="1011"></A>e.g. the omentum, mesentery, small intestine, colon, and the stomach itself. 
<A NAME="1012"></A>Nor is it surprising that the spleen should disgorge its surplus matters 
<A NAME="1013"></A>into the stomach at one time, while at another time it should draw some 
<A NAME="1014"></A>of its appropriate nutriment from the stomach.
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR><BR>For, as has already been said, speaking generally, everything has 
<A NAME="1016"></A>the power at different times of attracting from and of adding to everything 
<A NAME="1017"></A>else. What happens is just as if you might imagine a number of animals 
<A NAME="1018"></A>helping themselves at will to a plentiful common stock of food; some will 
<A NAME="1019"></A>naturally be eating when others have stopped, some will be on the point 
<A NAME="1020"></A>of stopping when others are beginning, some eating together, and others 
<A NAME="1021"></A>in succession. Yes, by Zeus! and one will often be plundering another, 
<A NAME="1022"></A>if he be in need while the other has an abundant supply ready to hand. 
<A NAME="1023"></A>Thus it is in no way surprising that matter should make its way back from 
<A NAME="1024"></A>the outer surface of the body to the interior, or should be carried from 
<A NAME="1025"></A>the liver and spleen into the stomach by the same vessels by which it was 
<A NAME="1026"></A>carried in the reverse direction.
<A NAME="1027"></A><BR><BR>In the case of the arteries this is clear enough, as also in the 
<A NAME="1028"></A>case of heart, thorax, and lungs; for, since all of these dilate and contract 
<A NAME="1029"></A>alternately, it must needs be that matter is subsequently discharged back 
<A NAME="1030"></A>into the parts from which it was previously drawn. Now Nature foresaw this 
<A NAME="1031"></A>necessity, and provided the cardiac openings of the vessels with membranous 
<A NAME="1032"></A>attachments, to prevent their contents from being carried backwards. How 
<A NAME="1033"></A>and in what manner this takes place will be stated in my work "On the Use 
<A NAME="1034"></A>of Parts," where among other things I show that it is impossible for the 
<A NAME="1035"></A>openings of the vessels to be closed so accurately that nothing at all 
<A NAME="1036"></A>can run back. Thus it is inevitable that the reflux into the venous artery 
<A NAME="1037"></A>(as will also be made clear in the work mentioned) should be much greater 
<A NAME="1038"></A>than through the other openings. But what it is important for our present 
<A NAME="1039"></A>purpose to recognise is that every thing possessing a large and appreciable 
<A NAME="1040"></A>cavity must, when it dilates, abstract matter from all its neighbours, 
<A NAME="1041"></A>and, when it contracts, must squeeze matter back into them. This should 
<A NAME="1042"></A>all be clear from what has already been said in this treatise and from 
<A NAME="1043"></A>what Erasistratus and I myself have demonstrated elsewhere respecting the 
<A NAME="1044"></A>tendency of a vacuum to become refilled.
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR><BR>14. And further, it has been shown in other treatises that all 
<A NAME="1046"></A>the arteries possess a power which derives from the heart, and by virtue 
<A NAME="1047"></A>of which they dilate and contract.
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR><BR>Put together, therefore, the two facts- that the arteries have 
<A NAME="1049"></A>this motion, and that everything, when it dilates, draws neighbouring matter 
<A NAME="1050"></A>into itself- and you will find nothing strange in the fact that those arteries 
<A NAME="1051"></A>which reach the skin draw in the outer air when they dilate, while those 
<A NAME="1052"></A>which anastomose at any point with the veins attract the thinnest and most 
<A NAME="1053"></A>vaporous part of the blood which these contain, and as for those arteries 
<A NAME="1054"></A>which are near the heart, it is on the heart itself that they exert their 
<A NAME="1055"></A>traction. For, by virtue of the tendency by which a vacuum becomes refilled, 
<A NAME="1056"></A>the lightest and thinnest part obeys the tendency before that which is 
<A NAME="1057"></A>heavier and thicker. Now the lightest and thinnest of anything in the body 
<A NAME="1058"></A>is firstly pneuma, secondly vapour, and in the third place that part of 
<A NAME="1059"></A>the blood which has been accurately elaborated and refined.
<A NAME="1060"></A><BR><BR>These, then, are what the arteries draw into themselves on every 
<A NAME="1061"></A>side; those arteries which reach the skin draw in the outer air (this being 
<A NAME="1062"></A>near them and one of the lightest of things); as to the other arteries, 
<A NAME="1063"></A>those which pass up from the heart into the neck, and that which lies along 
<A NAME="1064"></A>the spine, as also such arteries as are near these- draw mostly from the 
<A NAME="1065"></A>heart itself; and those which are farther from the heart and skin necessarily 
<A NAME="1066"></A>draw the lightest part of the blood out of the veins. So also the traction 
<A NAME="1067"></A>exercised by the diastole of the arteries which go to the stomach and intestines 
<A NAME="1068"></A>takes place at the expense of the heart itself and the numerous veins in 
<A NAME="1069"></A>its neighbourhood; for these arteries cannot get anything worth speaking 
<A NAME="1070"></A>of from the thick heavy nutriment contained in the intestines and stomach, 
<A NAME="1071"></A>since they first become filled with lighter elements. For if you let down 
<A NAME="1072"></A>a tube into a vessel full of water and sand, and suck the air out of the 
<A NAME="1073"></A>tube with your mouth, the sand cannot come up to you before the water, 
<A NAME="1074"></A>for in accordance with the principle of the refilling of a vacuum the lighter 
<A NAME="1075"></A>matter is always the first to succeed to the evacuation.
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR><BR>15. is not to be wondered at, therefore, that only a very little 
<A NAME="1077"></A>[nutrient matter] such, namely, as has been accurately elaborated- gets 
<A NAME="1078"></A>from the stomach into the arteries, since these first become filled with 
<A NAME="1079"></A>lighter matter. We must understand that there are two kinds of attraction, 
<A NAME="1080"></A>that by which a vacuum becomes refilled and that caused by appropriateness 
<A NAME="1081"></A>of quality; air is drawn into bellows in one way, and iron by the lodestone 
<A NAME="1082"></A>in another. And we must also understand that the traction which results 
<A NAME="1083"></A>from evacuation acts primarily on what is light, whilst that from appropriateness 
<A NAME="1084"></A>of quality acts frequently, it may be, on what is heavier (if this should 
<A NAME="1085"></A>be naturally more nearly related). Therefore, in the case of the heart 
<A NAME="1086"></A>and the arteries, it is in so far as they are hollow organs, capable of 
<A NAME="1087"></A>diastole, that they always attract the lighter matter first, while, in 
<A NAME="1088"></A>so far as they require nourishment, it is actually into their coats (which 
<A NAME="1089"></A>are the real bodies of these organs) that the appropriate matter is drawn. 
<A NAME="1090"></A>Of the blood, then, which is taken into their cavities when they dilate, 
<A NAME="1091"></A>that part which is most proper to them and most able to afford nourishment 
<A NAME="1092"></A>is attracted by their actual coats.
<A NAME="1093"></A><BR><BR>Now, apart from what has been said, the following is sufficient 
<A NAME="1094"></A>proof that something is taken over from the veins into the arteries. If 
<A NAME="1095"></A>you will kill an a
