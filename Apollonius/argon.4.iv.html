<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Now do thou thyself, goddess Muse, daughter of Zeus, tell of the labour 
<A NAME="11"></A>and wiles of the Colchian maiden.  Surely my soul within me wavers with 
<A NAME="12"></A>speechless amazement as I ponder whether I should call it the lovesick 
<A NAME="13"></A>grief of mad passion or a panic flight, through which she left the Colchian 
<A NAME="14"></A>folk.
<A NAME="15"></A><BR><BR>Aeetes all night long with the bravest captains of his people was 
<A NAME="16"></A>devising in his halls sheer treachery against the heroes, with fierce wrath 
<A NAME="17"></A>in his heart at the issue of the hateful contest; nor did he deem at all 
<A NAME="18"></A>that these things were being accomplished without the knowledge of his 
<A NAME="19"></A>daughters.
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><BR>But into Medea's heart Hera cast most grievous fear; and she trembled 
<A NAME="21"></A>like a nimble fawn whom the baying of hounds hath terrified amid the thicket 
<A NAME="22"></A>of a deep copse.  For at once she truly forboded that the aid she had given 
<A NAME="23"></A>was not hidden from her father, and that quickly she would fill up the 
<A NAME="24"></A>cup of woe.  And she dreaded the guilty knowledge of her handmaids; her 
<A NAME="25"></A>eyes were filled with fire and her ears rung with a terrible cry.  Often 
<A NAME="26"></A>did she clutch at her throat, and often did she drag out her hair by the 
<A NAME="27"></A>roots and groan in wretched despair.  There on that very day the maiden 
<A NAME="28"></A>would have tasted the drugs and perished and so have made void the purposes 
<A NAME="29"></A>of Hera, had not the goddess driven her, all bewildered, to flee with the 
<A NAME="30"></A>sons of Phrixus; and her fluttering soul within her was comforted; and 
<A NAME="31"></A>then she poured from her bosom all the drugs back again into the casket. 
<A NAME="32"></A> Then she kissed her bed, and the folding-doors on both sides, and stroked 
<A NAME="33"></A>the walls, and tearing away in her hands a long tress of hair, she left 
<A NAME="34"></A>it in the chamber for her mother, a memorial of her maidenhood, and thus 
<A NAME="35"></A>lamented with passionate voice:
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR>"I go, leaving this long tress here in my stead, O mother mine; 
<A NAME="37"></A>take this farewell from me as I go far hence; farewell Chalciope, and all 
<A NAME="38"></A>my home.  Would that the sea, stranger, had dashed thee to pieces, ere 
<A NAME="39"></A>thou camest to the Colchian land!"
<A NAME="40"></A><BR><BR>Thus she spake, and from her eyes shed copious tears.  And as a 
<A NAME="41"></A>bondmaid steals away from a wealthy house, whom fate has lately severed 
<A NAME="42"></A>from her native land, nor yet has she made trial of grievous toil, but 
<A NAME="43"></A>still unschooled to misery and shrinking in terror from slavish tasks, 
<A NAME="44"></A>goes about beneath the cruel hands of a mistress; even so the lovely maiden 
<A NAME="45"></A>rushed forth from her home.  But to her the bolts of the doors gave way 
<A NAME="46"></A>self-moved, leaping backwards at the swift strains of her magic song. 
<A NAME="47"></A> And with bare feet she sped along the narrow paths, with her left hand 
<A NAME="48"></A>holding her robe over her brow to veil her face and fair cheeks, and with 
<A NAME="49"></A>her right lifting up the hem of her tunic. Quickly along the dark track, 
<A NAME="50"></A>outside the towers of the spacious city, did she come in fear; nor did 
<A NAME="51"></A>any of the warders note her, but she sped on unseen by them.  Thence she 
<A NAME="52"></A>was minded to go to the temple; for well she knew the way, having often 
<A NAME="53"></A>aforetime wandered there in quest of corpses and noxious roots of the earth, 
<A NAME="54"></A>as a sorceress is wont to do; and her soul fluttered with quivering fear. 
<A NAME="55"></A> And the Titanian goddess, the moon, rising from a far land, beheld her 
<A NAME="56"></A>as she fled distraught, and fiercely exulted over her, and thus spake to 
<A NAME="57"></A>her own heart:
<A NAME="58"></A><BR><BR>"Not I alone then stray to the Latinian cave, nor do I alone burn 
<A NAME="59"></A>with love for fair Endymion; oft times with thoughts of love have I been 
<A NAME="60"></A>driven away by thy crafty spells, in order that in the darkness of night 
<A NAME="61"></A>thou mightest work thy sorcery at ease, even the deeds dear to thee.  And 
<A NAME="62"></A>now thou thyself too hast part in a like mad passion; and some god of affection 
<A NAME="63"></A>has given thee Jason to be thy grievous woe.  Well, go on, and steel thy 
<A NAME="64"></A>heart, wise though thou be, to take up thy burden of pain, fraught with 
<A NAME="65"></A>many sighs."
<A NAME="66"></A><BR><BR>Thus spake the goddess; but swiftly the maiden's feet bore her, 
<A NAME="67"></A>hasting on.  And gladly did she gain the high-bank of the river and beheld 
<A NAME="68"></A>on the opposite side the gleam of fire, which all night long the heroes 
<A NAME="69"></A>were kindling in joy at the contest's issue.  Then through the gloom, with 
<A NAME="70"></A>clear-pealing voice from across the stream, she called on Phrontis, the 
<A NAME="71"></A>youngest of Phrixus' sons, and he with his brothers and Aeson's son recognised 
<A NAME="72"></A>the maiden's voice; and in silence his comrades wondered when they knew 
<A NAME="73"></A>that it was so in truth.  Thrice she called, and thrice at the bidding 
<A NAME="74"></A>of the company Phrontis called out in reply; and meantime the heroes were 
<A NAME="75"></A>rowing with swift- moving oars in search of her.  Not yet were they casting 
<A NAME="76"></A>the ship's hawsers upon the opposite bank, when Jason with light feet leapt 
<A NAME="77"></A>to land from the deck above, and after him Phrontis and Argus, sons of 
<A NAME="78"></A>Phrixus, leapt to the ground; and she, clasping their knees with both hands, 
<A NAME="79"></A>thus addressed them:
<A NAME="80"></A><BR><BR>"Save me, the hapless one, my friends, from Aeetes, and yourselves 
<A NAME="81"></A>too, for all is brought to light, nor doth any remedy come.  But let us 
<A NAME="82"></A>flee upon the ship, before the king mounts his swift chariot.  And I will 
<A NAME="83"></A>lull to sleep the guardian serpent and give you the fleece of gold; but 
<A NAME="84"></A>do thou, stranger, amid thy comrades make the gods witness of the vows 
<A NAME="85"></A>thou hast taken on thyself for my sake; and now that I have fled far from 
<A NAME="86"></A>my country, make me not a mark for blame and dishonour for want of 
<A NAME="87"></A>kinsmen."
<A NAME="88"></A><BR><BR>She spake in anguish; but greatly did the heart of Aeson's son 
<A NAME="89"></A>rejoice, and at once, as she fell at his knees, he raised her gently and 
<A NAME="90"></A>embraced her, and spake words of comfort: "Lady, let Zeus of Olympus himself 
<A NAME="91"></A>be witness to my oath, and Hera, queen of marriage, bride of Zeus, that 
<A NAME="92"></A>I will set thee in my halls my own wedded wife, when we have reached the 
<A NAME="93"></A>land of Hellas on our return."
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spake, and straightway clasped her right hand in his; and 
<A NAME="95"></A>she bade them row the swift ship to the sacred grove near at hand, in order 
<A NAME="96"></A>that, while it was still night, they might seize and carry off the fleece 
<A NAME="97"></A>against the will of Aeetes. Word and deed were one to the eager crew. 
<A NAME="98"></A> For they took her on board, and straightway thrust the ship from shore; 
<A NAME="99"></A>and loud was the din as the chieftains strained at their oars, but she, 
<A NAME="100"></A>starting back, held out her hands in despair towards the shore. But Jason 
<A NAME="101"></A>spoke cheering words and restrained her grief.
<A NAME="102"></A><BR><BR>Now at the hour when men have cast sleep from their eyes~huntsmen, 
<A NAME="103"></A>who, trusting to their bounds, never slumber away the end of night, but 
<A NAME="104"></A>avoid the light of dawn lest, smiting with its white beams, it efface the 
<A NAME="105"></A>track and scent of the quarry -- then did Aeson's son and the maiden step 
<A NAME="106"></A>forth from the ship over a grassy spot, the "Ram's couch" as men call it, 
<A NAME="107"></A>where it first bent its wearied knees in rest, bearing on its back the 
<A NAME="108"></A>Minyan son of Athamas.  And close by, all smirched with soot, was the base 
<A NAME="109"></A>of the altar, which the Aeolid Phrixus once set up to Zeus, the alder of 
<A NAME="110"></A>fugitives, when he sacrificed the golden wonder at the bidding of Hermes 
<A NAME="111"></A>who graciously met him on the way.  There by the counsels of Argus the 
<A NAME="112"></A>chieftains put them ashore.
<A NAME="113"></A><BR><BR>And they two by the pathway came to the sacred grove, seeking the 
<A NAME="114"></A>huge oak tree on which was hung the fleece, like to a cloud that blushes 
<A NAME="115"></A>red with the fiery beams of the rising sun.  But right in front the serpent 
<A NAME="116"></A>with his keen sleepless eyes saw them coming, and stretched out his long 
<A NAME="117"></A>neck and hissed in awful wise; and all round the long banks of the river 
<A NAME="118"></A>echoed and the boundless grove.  Those heard it who dwelt in the Colchian 
<A NAME="119"></A>land very far from Titanian Aea, near the outfall of Lycus, the river which 
<A NAME="120"></A>parts from loud-roaring Araxes and blends his sacred stream with Phasis, 
<A NAME="121"></A>and they twain flow on together in one and pour their waters into the Caucasian 
<A NAME="122"></A>Sea. And through fear young mothers awoke, and round their new-born babes, 
<A NAME="123"></A>who were sleeping in their arms, threw their hands in agony, for the small 
<A NAME="124"></A>limbs started at that hiss.  And as when above a pile of smouldering wood 
<A NAME="125"></A>countless eddies of smoke roll up mingled with soot, and one ever springs 
<A NAME="126"></A>up quickly after another, rising aloft from beneath in wavering wreaths; 
<A NAME="127"></A>so at that time did that monster roll his countless coils covered with 
<A NAME="128"></A>hard dry scales.  And as he writhed, the maiden came before his eyes, with 
<A NAME="129"></A>sweet voice calling to her aid sleep, highest of gods, to charm the monster; 
<A NAME="130"></A>and she cried to the queen of the underworld, the night-wanderer, to be 
<A NAME="131"></A>propitious to her enterprise.  And Aeson's son followed in fear, but the 
<A NAME="132"></A>serpent, already charmed by her song, was relaxing the long ridge of his 
<A NAME="133"></A>giant spine, and lengthening out his myriad coils, like a dark wave, dumb 
<A NAME="134"></A>and noiseless, rolling over a sluggish sea; but still he raised aloft his 
<A NAME="135"></A>grisly head, eager to enclose them both in his murderous jaws.  But she 
<A NAME="136"></A>with a newly cut spray of juniper, dipping and drawing untempered charms 
<A NAME="137"></A>from her mystic brew, sprinkled his eyes, while she chanted her song; and 
<A NAME="138"></A>all around the potent scent of the charm cast sleep; and on the very spot 
<A NAME="139"></A>he let his jaw sink down; and far behind through the wood with its many 
<A NAME="140"></A>trees were those countless coils stretched out.
<A NAME="141"></A><BR><BR>Hereupon Jason snatched the golden fleece from the oak, at the 
<A NAME="142"></A>maiden bidding; and she, standing firm, smeared with the charm the monster's 
<A NAME="143"></A>head, till Jason himself bade her turn back towards their ship, and she 
<A NAME="144"></A>left the grove of Ares, dusky with shade. And as a maiden catches on her 
<A NAME="145"></A>finely wrought robe the gleam of the moon at the full, as it rises above 
<A NAME="146"></A>her high-roofed chamber; and her heart rejoices as she beholds the fair 
<A NAME="147"></A>ray; so at that time did Jason uplift the mighty fleece in his hands; and 
<A NAME="148"></A>from the shimmering of the flocks of wool there settled on his fair cheeks 
<A NAME="149"></A>and brow a red flush like a flame.  And great as is the hide of a yearling 
<A NAME="150"></A>ox or stag, which huntsmen call a brocket, so great in extent was the fleece 
<A NAME="151"></A>all golden above.  Heavy it was, thickly clustered with flocks; and as 
<A NAME="152"></A>he moved along, even beneath his feet the sheen rose up from the earth. 
<A NAME="153"></A> And he strode on now with the fleece covering his left shoulder from the 
<A NAME="154"></A>height of his neck to his feet, and now again he gathered it up in his 
<A NAME="155"></A>hands; for he feared exceedingly, lest some god or man should meet him 
<A NAME="156"></A>and deprive him thereof.
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR>Dawn was spreading over the earth when they reached the throng 
<A NAME="158"></A>of heroes; and the youths marvelled to behold the mighty fleece, which 
<A NAME="159"></A>gleamed like the lightning of Zeus.  And each one started up eager to touch 
<A NAME="160"></A>it and clasp it in his hands. But the son of Aeson restrained them all, 
<A NAME="161"></A>and threw over it a mantle newly-woven; and he led the maiden to the stern 
<A NAME="162"></A>and seated her there, and spake to them all as follows:
<A NAME="163"></A><BR><BR>"No longer now, my friends, forbear to return to your fatherland. 
<A NAME="164"></A> For now the task for which we dared this grievous voyage, toiling with 
<A NAME="165"></A>bitter sorrow of heart, has been lightly fulfilled by the maiden's counsels. 
<A NAME="166"></A> Her--for such is her will--I will bring home to be my wedded wife; do 
<A NAME="167"></A>ye preserve her, the glorious saviour of all Achaea and of yourselves. 
<A NAME="168"></A> For of a surety, I ween, will Aeetes come with his host to bar our passage 
<A NAME="169"></A>from the river into the sea.  But do some of you toil at the oars in turn, 
<A NAME="170"></A>sitting man by man; and half of you raise your shields of oxhide, a ready 
<A NAME="171"></A>defence against the darts of the enemy, and guard our return.  And now 
<A NAME="172"></A>in our hands we hold the fate of our children and dear country and of our 
<A NAME="173"></A>aged parents; and on our venture all Hellas depends, to reap either the 
<A NAME="174"></A>shame of failure or great renown."
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spake, and donned his armour of war; and they cried aloud, 
<A NAME="176"></A>wondrously eager.  And he drew his sword from the sheath and cut the hawsers 
<A NAME="177"></A>at the stern.  And near the maiden he took his stand ready armed by the 
<A NAME="178"></A>steersman Aneaeus, and with their rowing the ship sped on as they strained 
<A NAME="179"></A>desperately to drive her clear of the river.
<A NAME="180"></A><BR><BR>By this time Medea's love and deeds had become known to haughty 
<A NAME="181"></A>Aeetes and to all the Colchians.  And they thronged to the assembly in 
<A NAME="182"></A>arms; and countless as the waves of the stormy sea when they rise crested 
<A NAME="183"></A>by the wind, or as the leaves that fall to the ground from the wood with 
<A NAME="184"></A>its myriad branches in the month when the leaves fall--who could reckon 
<A NAME="185"></A>their tale?--so they in countless number poured along the banks of the 
<A NAME="186"></A>river shouting in frenzy; and in his shapely chariot Aeetes shone forth 
<A NAME="187"></A>above all with his steeds, the gift of Helios, swift as the blasts of the 
<A NAME="188"></A>wind.  In his left hand he raised his curved shield, and in his right a 
<A NAME="189"></A>huge pine-torch, and near him in front stood up his mighty spear.  And 
<A NAME="190"></A>Apsyrtus held in his hands the reins of the steeds.  But already the ship 
<A NAME="191"></A>was cleaving the sea before her, urged on by stalwart oarsmen, and the 
<A NAME="192"></A>stream of the mighty river rushing down.  But the king in grievous anguish 
<A NAME="193"></A>lifted his hands and called on Helios and Zeus to bear witness to their 
<A NAME="194"></A>evil deeds; and terrible threats he uttered against all his people, that 
<A NAME="195"></A>unless they should with their own hands seize the maiden, either on the 
<A NAME="196"></A>land or still finding the ship on the swell of the open sea, and bring 
<A NAME="197"></A>her back, that so he might satisfy his eager soul with vengeance for all 
<A NAME="198"></A>those deeds, at the cost of their own lives they should learn and abide 
<A NAME="199"></A>all his rage and revenge.
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR>Thus spake Aeetes; and on that same day the Colchians launched 
<A NAME="201"></A>their ships and cast the tackle on board, and on that same day sailed forth 
<A NAME="202"></A>on the sea; thou wouldst not say so mighty a host was a fleet of ships, 
<A NAME="203"></A>but that a countless flight of birds, swarm on swarm, was clamouring over 
<A NAME="204"></A>the sea.
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR>Swiftly the wind blew, as the goddess Hera planned, so that most 
<A NAME="206"></A>quickly Aeaean Medea might reach the Pelasgian land, a bane to the house 
<A NAME="207"></A>of Pelias, and on the third morn they bound the ship's stern cables to 
<A NAME="208"></A>the shores of the Paphlagonians, at the mouth of the river Halys.  For 
<A NAME="209"></A>Medea bade them land and propitiate Hecate with sacrifice.  Now all that 
<A NAME="210"></A>the maiden prepared for offering the sacrifice may no man know, and may 
<A NAME="211"></A>my soul not urge me to sing thereof.  Awe restrains my lips, yet from that 
<A NAME="212"></A>time the altar which the heroes raised on the beach to the goddess remains 
<A NAME="213"></A>till now, a sight to men of a later day.
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR>And straightway Aeson's son and the rest of the heroes bethought 
<A NAME="215"></A>them of Phineus, how that he had said that their course from Aea should 
<A NAME="216"></A>be different, but to all alike his meaning was dim.  Then Argus spake, 
<A NAME="217"></A>and they eagerly hearkened:
<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR>"We go to Orchomenus, whither that unerring seer, whom ye met aforetime, 
<A NAME="219"></A>foretold your voyage.  For there is another course, signified by those 
<A NAME="220"></A>priests of the immortal gods, who have sprung from Tritonian Thebes.  As 
<A NAME="221"></A>yet all the stars that wheel in the heaven were not, nor yet, though one 
<A NAME="222"></A>should inquire, could aught be heard of the sacred race of the Danai. 
<A NAME="223"></A> Apidanean Arcadians alone existed, Arcadians who lived even before the 
<A NAME="224"></A>moon, it is said, eating acorns on the hills; nor at that time was the 
<A NAME="225"></A>Pelasgian land ruled by the glorious sons of Deucalion, in the days when 
<A NAME="226"></A>Egypt, mother of men of an older time, was called the fertile Morning-land, 
<A NAME="227"></A>and the river fair-flowing Triton, by which all the Morning-land is watered; 
<A NAME="228"></A>and never does the rain from Zeus moisten the earth; but from the flooding 
<A NAME="229"></A>of the river abundant crops spring up.  From this land, it is said, a king 
<A NAME="230"></A> made his way all round through the whole of Europe and Asia, trusting 
<A NAME="231"></A>in the might and strength and courage of his people; and countless cities 
<A NAME="232"></A>did he found wherever he came, whereof some are still inhabited and some 
<A NAME="233"></A>not; many an age hath passed since then.  But Aea abides unshaken even 
<A NAME="234"></A>now and the sons of those men whom that king settled to dwell in Aea. 
<A NAME="235"></A> They preserve the writings of their fathers, graven on pillars, whereon 
<A NAME="236"></A>are marked all the ways and the limits of sea and land as ye journey on 
<A NAME="237"></A>all sides round.  There is a river, the uttermost horn of Ocean, broad 
<A NAME="238"></A>and exceeding deep, that a merchant ship may traverse; they call it Ister 
<A NAME="239"></A>and have marked it far off; and for a while it cleaves the boundless tilth 
<A NAME="240"></A>alone in one stream; for beyond the blasts of the north wind, far off in 
<A NAME="241"></A>the Rhipaean mountains, its springs burst forth with a roar.  But when 
<A NAME="242"></A>it enters the boundaries of the Thracians and Scythians, here, dividing 
<A NAME="243"></A>its stream into two, it sends its waters partly into the Ionian sea,  and 
<A NAME="244"></A>partly to the south into a deep gulf that bends upwards from the Trinaerian 
<A NAME="245"></A>sea, that sea which lies along your land, if indeed Achelous flows forth 
<A NAME="246"></A>from your land."
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spake, and to them the goddess granted a happy portent, 
<A NAME="248"></A>and all at the sight shouted approval, that this was their appointed path. 
<A NAME="249"></A> For before them appeared a trail of heavenly light, a sign where they 
<A NAME="250"></A>might pass.  And gladly they left behind there the son of Lyeus and with 
<A NAME="251"></A>canvas outspread sailed over the sea, with their eyes on the Paphlagonian 
<A NAME="252"></A>mountains.  But they did not round Carambis, for the winds and the gleam 
<A NAME="253"></A>of the heavenly fire stayed with them till they reached Ister's mighty 
<A NAME="254"></A>stream.
<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR>Now some of the Colchians, in a vain search, passed out from Pontus 
<A NAME="256"></A>through the Cyanean rocks; but the rest went to the river, and them Apsyrtus 
<A NAME="257"></A>led, and, turning aside, he entered the mouth called Fair.  Wherefore he 
<A NAME="258"></A>outstripped the heroes by crossing a neck of land into the furthest gulf 
<A NAME="259"></A>of the Ionian sea.  For a certain island is enclosed by Ister, by name 
<A NAME="260"></A>Peuee, three-cornered, its base stretching along the coast, and with a 
<A NAME="261"></A>sharp angle towards the river; and round it the outfall is cleft in two. 
<A NAME="262"></A> One mouth they call the mouth of Narex, and the other, at the lower end, 
<A NAME="263"></A>the Fair mouth.  And through this Apsyrtus and his Colchians rushed with 
<A NAME="264"></A>all speed; but the heroes went upwards far away towards the highest part 
<A NAME="265"></A>of the island. And in the meadows the country shepherds left their countless 
<A NAME="266"></A>flocks for dread of the ships, for they deemed that they were beasts coming 
<A NAME="267"></A>forth from the monster-teeming sea.  For never yet before had they seen 
<A NAME="268"></A>seafaring ships, neither the Scythians mingled with the Thracians, nor 
<A NAME="269"></A>the Sigynni, nor yet the Graucenii, nor the Sindi that now inhabit the 
<A NAME="270"></A>vast desert plain of Laurium.  But when they had passed near the mount 
<A NAME="271"></A>Angurum, and the cliff of Cauliacus, far from the mount Angurum, round 
<A NAME="272"></A>which Ister, dividing his stream, falls into the sea on this side and on 
<A NAME="273"></A>that, and the Laurian plain, then indeed the Colchians went forth into 
<A NAME="274"></A>the Cronian sea and cut off all the ways, to prevent their foes' escape. 
<A NAME="275"></A> And the heroes came down the river behind and reached the two Brygean 
<A NAME="276"></A>isles of Artemis near at hand.  Now in one of them was a sacred temple; 
<A NAME="277"></A>and on the other they landed, avoiding the host of Apsyrtus; for the Colchians 
<A NAME="278"></A>had left these islands out of many within the river, just as they were, 
<A NAME="279"></A>through reverence for the daughter of Zeus; but the rest, thronged by the 
<A NAME="280"></A>Colchians, barred the ways to the sea.  And so on other islands too, close 
<A NAME="281"></A>by, Apsyrtus left his host as far as the river Salangon and the Nestian 
<A NAME="282"></A>land.
<A NAME="283"></A><BR><BR>There the Minyae would at that time have yielded in grim fight, 
<A NAME="284"></A>a few to many; but ere then they made a covenant, shunning a dire quarrel; 
<A NAME="285"></A>as to the golden fleece, that since Aeetes himself had so promised them 
<A NAME="286"></A>if they should fulfill the contests, they should keep it as justly won, 
<A NAME="287"></A>whether they carried it off by craft or even openly in the king's despite; 
<A NAME="288"></A>but as to Medea--for that was the cause of strife--that they should give 
<A NAME="289"></A>her in ward to Leto's daughter apart from the throng, until some one of 
<A NAME="290"></A>the kings that dispense justice should utter his doom, whether she must 
<A NAME="291"></A>return to her father's home or follow the chieftains to the land of 
<A NAME="292"></A>Hellas.
<A NAME="293"></A><BR><BR>Now when the maiden had mused upon all this, sharp anguish shook 
<A NAME="294"></A>her heart unceasingly; and quickly she called forth Jason alone apart from 
<A NAME="295"></A>his comrades, and led him aside until they were far away, and before his 
<A NAME="296"></A>face uttered her speech all broken with sobs:
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR>"What is this purpose that ye are now devising about me, O son 
<A NAME="298"></A>of Aeson?  Has thy triumph utterly cast forgetfulness upon thee, and reekest 
<A NAME="299"></A>thou nothing of all that thou spakest when held fast by necessity?  Whither 
<A NAME="300"></A>are fled the oaths by Zeus the suppliants' god, whither are fled thy honied 
<A NAME="301"></A>promises?  For which in no seemly wise, with shameless will, I have left 
<A NAME="302"></A>my country, the glories of my home and even my parents -- things that were 
<A NAME="303"></A>dearest to me; and far away all alone I am borne over the sea with the 
<A NAME="304"></A>plaintive kingfishers because of thy trouble, in order that I might save 
<A NAME="305"></A>thy life in fulfilling the contests with the oxen and the earthborn men. 
<A NAME="306"></A> Last of all the fleece--when the matter became known, it was by my folly 
<A NAME="307"></A>thou didst win it; and a foul reproach have I poured on womankind. Wherefore 
<A NAME="308"></A>I say that as thy child, thy bride and thy sister, I follow thee to the 
<A NAME="309"></A>land of Hellas.  Be ready to stand by me to the end, abandon me not left 
<A NAME="310"></A>forlorn of thee when thou dost visit the kings.  But only save me; let 
<A NAME="311"></A>justice and right, to which we have both agreed, stand firm; or else do 
<A NAME="312"></A>thou at once shear through this neck with the sword, that I may gain the 
<A NAME="313"></A>guerdon due to my mad passion.  Poor wretch!  if the king, to whom you 
<A NAME="314"></A>both commit your cruel covenant, doom me to belong to my brother.  How 
<A NAME="315"></A>shall I come to my father's sight?  Will it be with a good name? What revenge, 
<A NAME="316"></A>what heavy calamity shall I not endure in agony for the terrible deeds 
<A NAME="317"></A>I have done?  And wilt thou win the return that thy heart desires?  Never 
<A NAME="318"></A>may Zeus' bride, the queen of all, in whom thou dost glory, bring that 
<A NAME="319"></A>to pass.  Mayst thou some time remember me when thou art racked with anguish; 
<A NAME="320"></A>may the fleece like a dream vanish into the nether darkness on the wings 
<A NAME="321"></A>of the wind!  And may my avenging Furies forthwith drive thee from thy 
<A NAME="322"></A>country, for all that I have suffered through thy cruelty!  These curses 
<A NAME="323"></A>will not be allowed to fall unaccomplished to the ground.  A mighty oath 
<A NAME="324"></A>hast thou transgressed, ruthless one; but not long shalt thou and thy comrades 
<A NAME="325"></A>sit at ease casting eyes of mockery upon me, for all your 
<A NAME="326"></A>covenants."
<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR>Thus she spake, seething with fierce wrath; and she longed to set 
<A NAME="328"></A>fire to the ship and to hew it utterly in pieces, and herself to fall into 
<A NAME="329"></A>the raging flame.  But Jason, half afraid, thus addressed her with gentle 
<A NAME="330"></A>words:
<A NAME="331"></A><BR><BR>"Forbear, lady; me too this pleases not.  But we seek some respite 
<A NAME="332"></A>from battle, for such a cloud of hostile men, like to a fire, surrounds 
<A NAME="333"></A>us, on thy account.  For all that inhabit this land are eager to aid Apsyrtus, 
<A NAME="334"></A>that they may lead thee back home to thy father, like some captured maid. 
<A NAME="335"></A> And all of us would perish in hateful destruction, if we closed with them 
<A NAME="336"></A>in fight; and bitterer still will be the pain, if we are slain and leave 
<A NAME="337"></A>thee to be their prey.  But this covenant will weave a web of guile to 
<A NAME="338"></A>lead him to ruin.  Nor will the people of the land for thy sake oppose 
<A NAME="339"></A>us, to favour the Colchians, when their prince is no longer with them, 
<A NAME="340"></A>who is thy champion and thy brother; nor will I shrink from matching myself 
<A NAME="341"></A>in fight with the Colchians, if they bar my way homeward."
<A NAME="342"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spake soothing her; and she uttered a deadly speech: "Take 
<A NAME="343"></A>heed now.  For when sorry deeds are done we must needs devise sorry counsel, 
<A NAME="344"></A>since at first I was distraught by my error, and by heaven's will it was 
<A NAME="345"></A>I wrought the accomplishment of evil desires.  Do thou in the turmoil shield 
<A NAME="346"></A>me from the Colchians' spears; and I will beguile Apsyrtus to come into 
<A NAME="347"></A>thy hands--do thou greet him with splendid gifts--if only I could persuade 
<A NAME="348"></A>the heralds on their departure to bring him alone to hearken to my words. 
<A NAME="349"></A> Thereupon if this deed pleases thee, slay him and raise a conflict with 
<A NAME="350"></A>the Colchians, I care not.
<A NAME="351"></A><BR><BR>So they two agreed and prepared a great web of guile for Apsyrtus, 
<A NAME="352"></A>and provided many gifts such as are due to guests, and among them gave 
<A NAME="353"></A>a sacred robe of Hypsipyle, of crimson hue.  The Graces with their own 
<A NAME="354"></A>hands had wrought it for Dionysus in sea-girt Dia, and he gave it to his 
<A NAME="355"></A>son Thoas thereafter, and Thoas left it to Hypsipyle, and she gave that 
<A NAME="356"></A>fair-wrought guest-gift with many another marvel to Aeson's son to wear. 
<A NAME="357"></A> Never couldst thou satisfy thy sweet desire by touching it or gazing on 
<A NAME="358"></A>it.  And from it a divine fragrance breathed from the time when the king 
<A NAME="359"></A>of Nysa himself lay to rest thereon, flushed with wine and nectar as he 
<A NAME="360"></A>clasped the beauteous breast of the maiden-daughter of Minos, whom once 
<A NAME="361"></A>Theseus forsook in the island of Dia, when she had followed him from Cnossus. 
<A NAME="362"></A> And when she had worked upon the heralds to induce her brother to come, 
<A NAME="363"></A>as soon as she reached the temple of the goddess, according to the agreement, 
<A NAME="364"></A>and the darkness of night surrounded them, that so she might devise with 
<A NAME="365"></A>him a cunning plan for her to take the mighty fleece of gold and return 
<A NAME="366"></A>to the home of Aeetes, for, she said, the sons of Phrixus had given her 
<A NAME="367"></A>by force to the strangers to carry off; with such beguiling words she scattered 
<A NAME="368"></A>to the air and the breezes her witching charms, which even from afar would 
<A NAME="369"></A>have drawn down the savage beast from the steep mountain-height.
<A NAME="370"></A><BR><BR>Ruthless Love, great bane, great curse to mankind, from thee come 
<A NAME="371"></A>deadly strifes and lamentations and groans, and countless pains as well 
<A NAME="372"></A>have their stormy birth from thee. Arise, thou god, and arm thyself against 
<A NAME="373"></A>the sons of our foes in such guise as when thou didst fill Medea's heart 
<A NAME="374"></A>with accursed madness.  How then by evil doom did she slay Apsyrtus when 
<A NAME="375"></A>he came to meet her?  For that must our song tell next.
<A NAME="376"></A><BR><BR>When the heroes had left the maiden on the island of Artemis, according 
<A NAME="377"></A>to the covenant, both sides ran their ships to land separately.  And Jason 
<A NAME="378"></A>went to the ambush to lie in wait for Apsyrtus and then for his comrades. 
<A NAME="379"></A> But he, beguiled by these dire promises, swiftly crossed the swell of 
<A NAME="380"></A>the sea in his ship, and in dark night set foot on the sacred island; and 
<A NAME="381"></A>faring all alone to meet her he made trial in speech of his sister, as 
<A NAME="382"></A>a tender child tries a wintry torrent which not even strong men can pass 
<A NAME="383"></A>through, to see if she would devise some guile against the strangers. 
<A NAME="384"></A> And so they two agreed together on everything; and straightway Aeson's 
<A NAME="385"></A>son leapt forth from the thick ambush, lifting his bare sword in his hand; 
<A NAME="386"></A>and quickly the maiden turned her eyes aside and covered them with her 
<A NAME="387"></A>veil that she might not see the blood of her brother when he was smitten. 
<A NAME="388"></A> And Jason marked him and struck him down, as a butcher strikes down a 
<A NAME="389"></A>mighty strong-horned bull, hard by the temple which the Brygi on the mainland 
<A NAME="390"></A>opposite had once built for Artemis.  In its vestibule he fell on his knees; 
<A NAME="391"></A>and at last the hero breathing out his life caught up in both hands the 
<A NAME="392"></A>dark blood as it welled from the wound; and he dyed with red his sister's 
<A NAME="393"></A>silvery veil and robe as she shrank away.  And with swift side-glance the 
<A NAME="394"></A>irresistible pitiless Fury beheld the deadly deed they had done. And the 
<A NAME="395"></A>hero, Aeson's son, cut off the extremities of the dead man, and thrice 
<A NAME="396"></A>licked up some blood and thrice spat the pollution from his teeth, as it 
<A NAME="397"></A>is right for the slayer to do, to atone for a treacherous murder.  And 
<A NAME="398"></A>the clammy corpse he hid in the ground where even now those bones lie among 
<A NAME="399"></A>the Apsyrtians.
<A NAME="400"></A><BR><BR>Now as soon as the heroes saw the blaze of a torch, which the maiden 
<A NAME="401"></A>raised for them as a sign to pursue, they laid their own ship near the 
<A NAME="402"></A>Colchian ship, and they slaughtered the Colchian host, as kites slay the 
<A NAME="403"></A>tribes of wood-pigeons, or as lions of the wold, when they have leapt amid 
<A NAME="404"></A>the steading, drive a great flock of sheep huddled together.  Nor did one 
<A NAME="405"></A>of them escape death, but the heroes rushed upon the whole crew, destroying 
<A NAME="406"></A>them like a flame; and at last Jason met them, and was eager to give aid 
<A NAME="407"></A>where none was needed; but already they were taking thought for him too. 
<A NAME="408"></A> Thereupon they sat to devise some) prudent counsel for their voyage, and 
<A NAME="409"></A>the maiden came upon them as they pondered, but Peleus spake his word 
<A NAME="410"></A>first:
<A NAME="411"></A><BR><BR>"I now bid you embark while it is still night, and take with your 
<A NAME="412"></A>oars the passage opposite to that which the enemy guards, for at dawn when 
<A NAME="413"></A>they see their plight I deem that no word urging to further pursuit of 
<A NAME="414"></A>us will prevail with them; but as people bereft of their king, they will 
<A NAME="415"></A>be scattered in grievous dissension.  And easy, when the people are scattered, 
<A NAME="416"></A>will this path be for us on our return."
<A NAME="417"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spake; and the youths assented to the words of Aeacus' 
<A NAME="418"></A>son.  And quickly they entered the ship, and toiled at their oars unceasingly 
<A NAME="419"></A>until they reached the sacred isle of Electra, the highest of them all, 
<A NAME="420"></A>near the river Eridanus.
<A NAME="421"></A><BR><BR>But when the Colchians learnt the death of their prince, verily 
<A NAME="422"></A>they were eager to pursue Argo and the Minyans through all the Cronian 
<A NAME="423"></A>sea.  But Hera restrained them by terrible lightnings from the sky.  And 
<A NAME="424"></A>at last they loathed their own homes in the Cytaean land, quailing before 
<A NAME="425"></A>Aeetes' fierce wrath; so they landed and made abiding homes there, scattered 
<A NAME="426"></A>far and wide.  Some set foot on those very islands where the heroes had 
<A NAME="427"></A>stayed, and they still dwell there, bearing a name derived from Apsyrtus; 
<A NAME="428"></A>and others built a fenced city by the dark deep Illyrian river, where is 
<A NAME="429"></A>the tomb of Harmonia and Cadmus, dwelling among the Encheleans; and others 
<A NAME="430"></A>live amid the mountains which are called the Thunderers, from the day when 
<A NAME="431"></A>the thunders of Zeus, son of Cronos, prevented them from crossing over 
<A NAME="432"></A>to the island opposite.
<A NAME="433"></A><BR><BR>Now the heroes, when their return seemed safe for them, fared onward 
<A NAME="434"></A>and made their hawsers fast to the land of the Hylleans.  For the islands 
<A NAME="435"></A>lay thick in the river and made the path dangerous for those who sailed 
<A NAME="436"></A>thereby.  Nor, as aforetime, did the Hylleans devise their hurt, but of 
<A NAME="437"></A>their own accord furthered their passage, winning as guerdon a mighty tripod 
<A NAME="438"></A>of Apollo.  For tripods twain had Phoebus given to Aeson's son to carry 
<A NAME="439"></A>afar in the voyage he had to make, at the time when he went to sacred Pytho 
<A NAME="440"></A>to enquire about this very voyage; and it was ordained by fate that in 
<A NAME="441"></A>whatever land they should be placed, that land should never be ravaged 
<A NAME="442"></A>by the attacks of foemen. Therefore even now this tripod is hidden in that 
<A NAME="443"></A>land near the pleasant city of Hyllus, far beneath the earth, that it may 
<A NAME="444"></A>ever be unseen by mortals.  Yet they found not King Hyllus still alive 
<A NAME="445"></A>in the land, whom fair Melite bare to Heracles in the land of the Phaeacians. 
<A NAME="446"></A> For he came to the abode of Nausithous and to Macris, the nurse of Dionysus, 
<A NAME="447"></A>to cleanse himself from the deadly murder of his children; here he loved 
<A NAME="448"></A>and overcame the water nymph Melite, the daughter of the river Aegaeus, 
<A NAME="449"></A>and she bare mighty Hyllus.  But when he had grown up he desired not to 
<A NAME="450"></A>dwell in that island under the rule of Nausithous the king; but he collected 
<A NAME="451"></A>a host of native Phaeacians and came to the Cronian sea; for the hero King 
<A NAME="452"></A>Nausithous aided his journey, and there he settled, and the Mentores slew 
<A NAME="453"></A>him as he was fighting for the oxen of his field.
<A NAME="454"></A><BR><BR>Now, goddesses, say how it is that beyond this sea, near the land 
<A NAME="455"></A>of Ausonia and the Ligystian isles, which are called Stoechades, the mighty 
<A NAME="456"></A>tracks of the ship Argo are clearly sung of?  What great constraint and 
<A NAME="457"></A>need brought the heroes so far?  What breezes wafted 
<A NAME="458"></A>them?
<A NAME="459"></A><BR><BR>When Apsyrtus had fallen in mighty overthrow Zeus himself, king 
<A NAME="460"></A>of gods, was seized with wrath at what they had done.  And he ordained 
<A NAME="461"></A>that by the counsels of Aeaean Circe they should cleanse themselves from 
<A NAME="462"></A>the terrible stain of blood and suffer countless woes before their return. 
<A NAME="463"></A> Yet none of the chieftains knew this; but far onward they sped starting 
<A NAME="464"></A>from the Hyllean land, and they left behind all the islands that were beforetime 
<A NAME="465"></A>thronged by the Colchians--the Liburnian isles, isle after isle, Issa, 
<A NAME="466"></A>Dysceladus, and lovely Pityeia.  Next after them they came to Corcyra, 
<A NAME="467"></A>where Poseidon settled the daughter of Asopus, fair-haired Corcyra, far 
<A NAME="468"></A>from the land of Phlius, whence he had carried her off through love; and 
<A NAME="469"></A>sailors beholding it from the sea, all black with its sombre woods, call 
<A NAME="470"></A>it Corcyra the Black.  And next they passed Melite, rejoicing in the soft-blowing 
<A NAME="471"></A>breeze, and steep Cerossus, and Nymphaea at a distance, where lady Calypso, 
<A NAME="472"></A>daughter of Atlas, dwelt; and they deemed they saw the misty mountains 
<A NAME="473"></A>of Thunder.  And then Hera bethought her of the counsels and wrath of Zeus 
<A NAME="474"></A>concerning them. And she devised an ending of their voyage and stirred 
<A NAME="475"></A>up storm-winds before them, by which they were caught and borne back to 
<A NAME="476"></A>the rocky isle of Electra.  And straightway on a sudden there called to 
<A NAME="477"></A>them in the midst of their course, speaking with a human voice, the beam 
<A NAME="478"></A>of the hollow ship, which Athena had set in the centre of the stem, made 
<A NAME="479"></A>of Dodonian oak.  And deadly fear seized them as they heard the voice that 
<A NAME="480"></A>told of the grievous wrath of Zeus.  For it proclaimed that they should 
<A NAME="481"></A>not escape the paths of an endless sea nor grievous tempests, unless Circe 
<A NAME="482"></A>should purge away the guilt of the ruthless murder of Apsyrtus; and it 
<A NAME="483"></A>bade Polydeuces and Castor pray to the immortal gods first to grant a path 
<A NAME="484"></A>through the Ausonian sea where they should find Circe, daughter of Perse 
<A NAME="485"></A>and Helios.
<A NAME="486"></A><BR><BR>Thus Argo cried through the darkness; and the sons of Tyndareus 
<A NAME="487"></A>uprose, and lifted their hands to the immortals praying for each boon: 
<A NAME="488"></A>but dejection held the rest of the Minyan heroes.  And far on sped Argo 
<A NAME="489"></A>under sail, and entered deep into the stream of Eridanus; where once, smitten 
<A NAME="490"></A>on the breast by the blazing bolt, Phaethon half-consumed fell from the 
<A NAME="491"></A>chariot of Helios into the opening of that deep lake; and even now it belcheth 
<A NAME="492"></A>up heavy steam clouds from the smouldering wound.  And no bird spreading 
<A NAME="493"></A>its light wings can cross that water; but in mid-course it plunges into 
<A NAME="494"></A>the flame, fluttering.  And all around the maidens, the daughters of Helios, 
<A NAME="495"></A>enclosed in tall poplars, wretchedly wail a piteous plaint; and from their 
<A NAME="496"></A>eyes they shed on the ground bright drops of amber.  These are dried by 
<A NAME="497"></A>the sun upon the sand; but whenever the waters of the dark lake flow over 
<A NAME="498"></A>the strand before the blast of the wailing wind, then they roll on in a 
<A NAME="499"></A>mass into Eridanus with swelling tide.  But the Celts have attached this 
<A NAME="500"></A>story to them, that these are the tears of Leto's son, Apollo, that are 
<A NAME="501"></A>borne along by the eddies, the countless tears that he shed aforetime when 
<A NAME="502"></A>he came to the sacred race of the Hyperboreans and left shining heaven 
<A NAME="503"></A>at the chiding of his father, being in wrath concerning his son whom divine 
<A NAME="504"></A>Coronis bare in bright Lacereia at the mouth of Amyrus.  And such is the 
<A NAME="505"></A>story told among these men.  But no desire for food or drink seized the 
<A NAME="506"></A>heroes nor were their thoughts turned to joy. But they were sorely afflicted 
<A NAME="507"></A>all day, heavy and faint at heart, with the noisome stench, hard to endure, 
<A NAME="508"></A>which the streams of Eridanus sent forth from Phaethon still burning; and 
<A NAME="509"></A>at night they heard the piercing lament of the daughters of Helios, wailing 
<A NAME="510"></A>with shrill voice; and, as they lamented, their tears were borne on the 
<A NAME="511"></A>water like drops of oil.
<A NAME="512"></A><BR><BR>Thence they entered the deep stream of Rhodanus which flows into 
<A NAME="513"></A>Eridanus; and where they meet there is a roar of mingling waters.  Now 
<A NAME="514"></A>that river, rising from the ends of the earth, where are the portals and 
<A NAME="515"></A>mansions of Night, on one side bursts forth upon the beach of Ocean, at 
<A NAME="516"></A>another pours into the Ionian sea, and on the third through seven mouths 
<A NAME="517"></A>sends its stream to the Sardinian sea and its limitless bay.   And from 
<A NAME="518"></A>Rhodanus they entered stormy lakes, which spread throughout the Celtic 
<A NAME="519"></A>mainland of wondrous size; and there they would have met with an inglorious 
<A NAME="520"></A>calamity; for a certain branch of the river was bearing them towards a 
<A NAME="521"></A>gulf of Ocean which in ignorance they were about to enter, and never would 
<A NAME="522"></A>they have returned from there in safety.  But Hera leaping forth from heaven 
<A NAME="523"></A>pealed her cry from the Hercynian rock; and all together were shaken with 
<A NAME="524"></A>fear of her cry; for terribly crashed the mighty firmament.  And backward 
<A NAME="525"></A>they turned by reason of the goddess, and noted the path by which their 
<A NAME="526"></A>return was ordained.  And after a long while they came to the beach of 
<A NAME="527"></A>the surging sea by the devising of Hera, passing unharmed through countless 
<A NAME="528"></A>tribes of the Celts and Ligyans.  For round them the goddess poured a dread 
<A NAME="529"></A>mist day by day as they fared on.  And so, sailing through the midmost 
<A NAME="530"></A>mouth, they reached the Stoechades islands in safety by the aid of the 
<A NAME="531"></A>sons of Zeus; wherefore altars and sacred rites are established in their 
<A NAME="532"></A>honour for ever; and not that sea-faring alone did they attend to succour; 
<A NAME="533"></A>but Zeus granted to them the ships of future sailors too.  Then leaving 
<A NAME="534"></A>the Stoechades they passed on to the island Aethalia, where after their 
<A NAME="535"></A>toil they wiped away with pebbles sweat in abundance; and pebbles like 
<A NAME="536"></A>skin in colour are strewn on the beach;  and there are their quoits and 
<A NAME="537"></A>their wondrous armour; and there is the Argoan harbour called after 
<A NAME="538"></A>them.
<A NAME="539"></A><BR><BR>And quickly from there they passed through the sea, beholding the 
<A NAME="540"></A>Tyrrhenian shores of Ausonia; and they came to the famous harbour of Aeaea, 
<A NAME="541"></A>and from the ship they cast hawsers to the shore near at hand.  And here 
<A NAME="542"></A>they found Circe bathing her head in the salt sea-spray, for sorely had 
<A NAME="543"></A>she been scared by visions of the night.  With blood her chambers and all 
<A NAME="544"></A>the walls of her palace seemed to be running, and flame was devouring all 
<A NAME="545"></A>the magic herbs with which she used to bewitch strangers whoever came; 
<A NAME="546"></A>and she herself with murderous blood quenched the glowing flame, drawing 
<A NAME="547"></A>it up in her hands; and she ceased from deadly fear.  Wherefore when morning 
<A NAME="548"></A>came she rose, and with sea-spray was bathing her hair and her garments. 
<A NAME="549"></A> And beasts, not resembling the beasts of the wild, nor yet like men in 
<A NAME="550"></A>body, but with a medley of limbs, went in a throng, as sheep from the fold 
<A NAME="551"></A>in multitudes follow the shepherd.  Such creatures, compacted of various 
<A NAME="552"></A>limbs, did each herself produce from the primeval slime when she had not 
<A NAME="553"></A>yet grown solid beneath a rainless sky nor yet had received a drop of moisture 
<A NAME="554"></A>from the rays of the scorching sun; but time combined these forms and marshalled 
<A NAME="555"></A>them in their ranks; in such wise these monsters shapeless of form followed 
<A NAME="556"></A>her.  And exceeding wonder seized the heroes, and at once, as each gazed 
<A NAME="557"></A>on the form and face of Circe, they readily guessed that she was the sister 
<A NAME="558"></A>of Aeetes.
<A NAME="559"></A><BR><BR>Now when she had dismissed the fears of her nightly visions, straightway 
<A NAME="560"></A>she fared backwards, and in her subtlety she bade the heroes follow, charming 
<A NAME="561"></A>them on with her hand.  Thereupon the host remained stedfast at the bidding 
<A NAME="562"></A>of Aeson's son, but Jason drew with him the Colchian maid.  And both followed 
<A NAME="563"></A>the selfsame path till they reached the hall of Circe, and she in amaze 
<A NAME="564"></A>at their coming bade them sit on brightly burnished seats.  And they, quiet 
<A NAME="565"></A>and silent, sped to the hearth and sat there, as is the wont of wretched 
<A NAME="566"></A>suppliants.  Medea hid her face in both her hands, but Jason fixed in the 
<A NAME="567"></A>ground the mighty hilted sword with which he had slain Aeetes' son; nor 
<A NAME="568"></A>did they raise their eyes to meet her look.  And straightway Circe became 
<A NAME="569"></A>aware of the doom of a suppliant and the guilt of murder. Wherefore in 
<A NAME="570"></A>reverence for the ordinance of Zeus, the god of suppliants, who is a god 
<A NAME="571"></A>of wrath yet mightily aids slayers of men, she began to offer the sacrifice 
<A NAME="572"></A>with which ruthless suppliants are cleansed from guilt when they approach 
<A NAME="573"></A>the altar. First, to atone for the murder still unexpiated, she held above 
<A NAME="574"></A>their heads the young of a sow whose dugs yet swelled from the fruit of 
<A NAME="575"></A>the womb, and, severing its neck, sprinkled their hands with the blood; 
<A NAME="576"></A>and again she made propitiation with other drink offerings, calling on 
<A NAME="577"></A>Zeus the Cleanser, the protector of murder- stained suppliants.  And all 
<A NAME="578"></A>the defilements in a mass her attendants bore forth from the palace--the 
<A NAME="579"></A>Naiad nymphs who ministered all things to her.  And within, Circe, standing 
<A NAME="580"></A>by the hearth, kept burning atonement-cakes without wine, praying the while 
<A NAME="581"></A>that she might stay from their wrath the terrible Furies, and that Zeus 
<A NAME="582"></A>himself might be propitious and gentle to them both, whether with hands 
<A NAME="583"></A>stained by the blood of a stranger or, as kinsfolk, by the blood of a kinsman, 
<A NAME="584"></A>they should implore his grace.
<A NAME="585"></A><BR><BR>But when she had wrought all her task, then she raised them up 
<A NAME="586"></A>and seated them on well polished seats, and herself sat near, face to face 
<A NAME="587"></A>with them.  And at once she asked them clearly of their business and their 
<A NAME="588"></A>voyaging, and whence they had come to her land and palace, and had thus 
<A NAME="589"></A>seated themselves as suppliants at her hearth.  For in truth the hideous 
<A NAME="590"></A>remembrance of her dreams entered her mind as she pondered; and she longed 
<A NAME="591"></A>to hear the voice of the maiden, her kinswoman, as soon as she saw that 
<A NAME="592"></A>she had raised her eyes from the ground. For all those of the race of Helios 
<A NAME="593"></A>were plain to discern, since by the far flashing of their eyes they shot 
<A NAME="594"></A>in front of them a gleam as of gold.  So Medea told her all she asked--the 
<A NAME="595"></A>daughter of Aeetes of the gloomy heart, speaking gently in the Colchian 
<A NAME="596"></A>tongue, both of the quest and the journeyings of the heroes, and of their 
<A NAME="597"></A>toils in the swift contests, and how she had sinned through the counsels 
<A NAME="598"></A>of her much-sorrowing sister, and how with the sons of Phrixus she had 
<A NAME="599"></A>fled afar from the tyrannous horrors of her father; but she shrank from 
<A NAME="600"></A>telling of the murder of Apsyrtus.  Yet she escaped not Circe's ken; nevertheless, 
<A NAME="601"></A>in spite of all, she pitied the weeping maiden, and spake 
<A NAME="602"></A>thus:
<A NAME="603"></A><BR><BR>"Poor wretch, an evil and shameful return hast thou planned.  Not 
<A NAME="604"></A>for long, I ween, wilt thou escape the heavy wrath of Aeetes; but soon 
<A NAME="605"></A>will he go even to the dwellings of Hellas to avenge the blood of his son, 
<A NAME="606"></A>for intolerable are the deeds thou hast done.  But since thou art my suppliant 
<A NAME="607"></A>and my kinswoman, no further ill shall I devise against thee at thy coming; 
<A NAME="608"></A>but begone from my halls, companioning the stranger, whosoever he be, this 
<A NAME="609"></A>unknown one that thou hast taken in thy father's despite; and kneel not 
<A NAME="610"></A>to me at my hearth, for never will I approve thy counsels and thy shameful 
<A NAME="611"></A>flight."
<A NAME="612"></A><BR><BR>Thus she spake, and measureless anguish seized the maid; and over 
<A NAME="613"></A>her eyes she cast her robe and poured forth a lamentation, until the hero 
<A NAME="614"></A>took her by the hand and led her forth from the hall quivering with fear. 
<A NAME="615"></A> So they left the home of Circe.
<A NAME="616"></A><BR><BR>But they were not unmarked by the spouse of Zeus, son of Cronos; 
<A NAME="617"></A>but Iris told her when she saw them faring from the hall.  For Hera had 
<A NAME="618"></A>bidden her watch what time they should come to the ship; so again she urged 
<A NAME="619"></A>her and spake:
<A NAME="620"></A><BR><BR>"Dear Iris, now come, if ever thou hast fulfilled my bidding, hie 
<A NAME="621"></A>thee away on light pinions, and bid Thetis arise from the sea and come 
<A NAME="622"></A>hither.  For need of her is come upon me. Then go to the sea-beaches where 
<A NAME="623"></A>the bronze anvils of Hephaestus are smitten by sturdy hammers, and tell 
<A NAME="624"></A>him to still the blasts of fire until Argo pass by them.  Then go to Aeolus 
<A NAME="625"></A>too, Aeolus who rules the winds, children of the clear sky; and to him 
<A NAME="626"></A>also tell my purpose so that he may make all winds cease under heaven and 
<A NAME="627"></A>no breeze may ruffle the sea; yet let the breath of the west wind blow 
<A NAME="628"></A>until the heroes have reached the Phaeacian isle of 
<A NAME="629"></A>Alcinous."
<A NAME="630"></A><BR><BR>So she spake, and straightway Iris leapt down from Olympus and 
<A NAME="631"></A>cleft her way, with light wings outspread.  And she plunged into the Aegean 
<A NAME="632"></A>Sea, where is the dwelling of Nereus. And she came to Thetis first and, 
<A NAME="633"></A>by the promptings of Hera, told her tale and roused her to go to the goddess. 
<A NAME="634"></A> Next she came to Hephaestus, and quickly made him cease from the clang 
<A NAME="635"></A>of his iron hammers; and the smoke-grimed bellows were stayed from their 
<A NAME="636"></A>blast.  And thirdly she came to Aeolus, the famous son of Hippotas.  And 
<A NAME="637"></A>when she had given her message to him also and rested her swift knees from 
<A NAME="638"></A>her course, then Thetis leaving Nereus and her sisters had come from the 
<A NAME="639"></A>sea to Olympus to the goddess Hera; and the goddess made her sit by her 
<A NAME="640"></A>side and uttered her word:
<A NAME="641"></A><BR><BR>"Hearken now, lady Thetis, to what I am eager to tell thee.  Thou 
<A NAME="642"></A>knowest how honoured in my heart is the hero, Aeson's son, and the others 
<A NAME="643"></A>that have helped him in the contest, and how I saved them when they passed 
<A NAME="644"></A>between the Wandering rocks,  where roar terrible storms of fire and the 
<A NAME="645"></A>waves foam round the rugged reefs.  And now past the mighty rock of Scylla 
<A NAME="646"></A>and Charybdis horribly belching, a course awaits them.  But thee indeed 
<A NAME="647"></A>from thy infancy did I tend with my own hands and love beyond all others 
<A NAME="648"></A>that dwell in the salt sea because thou didst refuse to share the couch 
<A NAME="649"></A>of Zeus, for all his desire.  For to him such deeds are ever dear, to embrace 
<A NAME="650"></A>either goddesses or mortal women.  But in reverence for me and with fear 
<A NAME="651"></A>in thy heart thou didst shrink from his love; and he then swore a mighty 
<A NAME="652"></A>oath that thou shouldst never be called the bride of an immortal god. Yet 
<A NAME="653"></A>he ceased not from spying thee against thy will, until reverend Themis 
<A NAME="654"></A>declared to him the whole truth, how that it was thy fate to bear a son 
<A NAME="655"></A>mightier than his sire; wherefore he gave thee up, for all his desire, 
<A NAME="656"></A>fearing lest another should be his match and rule the immortals, and in 
<A NAME="657"></A>order that he might ever hold his own dominion.  But I gave thee the best 
<A NAME="658"></A>of the sons of earth to be thy husband, that thou mightest find a marriage 
<A NAME="659"></A>dear to thy heart and bear children; and I summoned to the feast the gods, 
<A NAME="660"></A>one and all.  And with my own hand I raised the bridal torch, in return 
<A NAME="661"></A>for the kindly honour thou didst pay me.  But come, let me tell a tale 
<A NAME="662"></A>that erreth not.  When thy son shall come to the Elysian plain, he whom 
<A NAME="663"></A>now in the home of Cheiron the Centaur water-nymphs are tending, though 
<A NAME="664"></A>he still craves thy mother milk, it is fated that he be the husband of 
<A NAME="665"></A>Medea, Aeetes' daughter; do thou aid thy daughter-in-law as a mother-in-law 
<A NAME="666"></A>should, and aid Peleus himself.  Why is thy wrath so steadfast? He was 
<A NAME="667"></A>blinded by folly.  For blindness comes even upon the gods. Surely at my 
<A NAME="668"></A>behest I deem that Hephaestus will cease from kindling the fury of his 
<A NAME="669"></A>flame, and that Aeolus, son of Hippotas, will check his swift rushing winds, 
<A NAME="670"></A>all but the steady west wind, until they reach the havens of the Phaeacians; 
<A NAME="671"></A>do thou devise a return without bane.  The rocks and the tyrannous waves 
<A NAME="672"></A>are my fear, they alone, and them thou canst foil with thy sisters' aid. 
<A NAME="673"></A>And let them not fall in their helplessness into Charybdis lest she swallow 
<A NAME="674"></A>them at one gulp, or approach the hideous lair of Scylla, Ausonian Scylla 
<A NAME="675"></A>the deadly, whom night-wandering Hecate, who is called Crataeis,  bare 
<A NAME="676"></A>to Phoreys, lest swooping upon them with her horrible jaws she destroy 
<A NAME="677"></A>the chiefest of the heroes.  But guide their ship in the course where there 
<A NAME="678"></A>shall be still a hair's breadth escape from destruction."
<A NAME="679"></A><BR><BR>Thus she spake, and Thetis answered with these words: "If the fury 
<A NAME="680"></A>of the ravening flame and the stormy winds cease in very deed, surely will 
<A NAME="681"></A>I promise boldly to save the ship, even though the waves bar the way, if 
<A NAME="682"></A>only the west wind blows fresh and clear.  But it is time to fare on a 
<A NAME="683"></A>long and measureless path, in quest of my sisters who will aid me, and 
<A NAME="684"></A>to the spot where the ship's hawsers are fastened, that at early dawn the 
<A NAME="685"></A>heroes may take thought to win their home-return."
<A NAME="686"></A><BR><BR>She spake, and darting down from the sky fell amid the eddies of 
<A NAME="687"></A>the dark blue sea; and she called to aid her the rest of the Nereids, her 
<A NAME="688"></A>own sisters; and they heard her and gathered together; and Thetis declared 
<A NAME="689"></A>to them Hera's behests, and quickly sped them all on their way to the Ausonian 
<A NAME="690"></A>sea.  And herself, swifter than the flash of an eye or the shafts of the 
<A NAME="691"></A>sun, when it rises upwards from a far-distant land, hastened swiftly through 
<A NAME="692"></A>the sea, until she reached the Aeaean beach of the Tyrrhenian mainland. 
<A NAME="693"></A> And the heroes she found by the ship taking their pastime with quoits 
<A NAME="694"></A>and shooting of arrows; and she drew near and just touched the hand of 
<A NAME="695"></A>Aeaeus' son Peleus, for he was her husband; nor could anyone see her clearly, 
<A NAME="696"></A>but she appeared to his eyes alone, and thus addressed 
<A NAME="697"></A>him:
<A NAME="698"></A><BR><BR>"No longer now must ye stay sitting on the Tyrrhenian beach, but 
<A NAME="699"></A>at dawn loosen the hawsers of your swift ship, in obedience to Hera, your 
<A NAME="700"></A>helper.  For at her behest the maiden daughters of Nereus have met together 
<A NAME="701"></A>to draw your ship through the midst of the rocks which are called Planctae, 
<A NAME="702"></A> for that is your destined path.  But do thou show my person to no one, 
<A NAME="703"></A>when thou seest us come to meet time, but keep it secret in thy mind, lest 
<A NAME="704"></A>thou anger me still more than thou didst anger me before so 
<A NAME="705"></A>recklessly."
<A NAME="706"></A><BR><BR>She spake, and vanished into the depths of the sea; but sharp pain 
<A NAME="707"></A>smote Peleus, for never before had he seen her come, since first she left 
<A NAME="708"></A>her bridal chamber and bed in anger, on account of noble Achilles, then 
<A NAME="709"></A>a babe.  For she ever encompassed the child's mortal flesh in the night 
<A NAME="710"></A>with the flame of fire; and day by day she anointed with ambrosia his tender 
<A NAME="711"></A>frame, so that he might become immortal and that she might keep off from 
<A NAME="712"></A>his body loathsome old age.  But Peleus leapt up from his bed and saw his 
<A NAME="713"></A>dear son gasping in the flame; and at the sight he uttered a terrible cry, 
<A NAME="714"></A>fool that he was; and she heard it, and catching up the child threw him 
<A NAME="715"></A>screaming to the ground, and herself like a breath of wind passed swiftly 
<A NAME="716"></A>from the hall as a dream and leapt into the sea, exceeding wroth, and thereafter 
<A NAME="717"></A>returned not again.  Wherefore blank amazement fettered his soul; nevertheless 
<A NAME="718"></A>he declared to his comrades all the bidding of Thetis.  And they broke 
<A NAME="719"></A>off in the midst and hurriedly ceased their contests, and prepared their 
<A NAME="720"></A>meal and earth-strewn beds, whereon after supper they slept through the 
<A NAME="721"></A>night as aforetime.
<A NAME="722"></A><BR><BR>Now when dawn the light-bringer was touching the edge of heaven, 
<A NAME="723"></A>then at the coming of the swift west wind they went to their thwarts from 
<A NAME="724"></A>the land; and gladly did they draw up the anchors from the deep and made 
<A NAME="725"></A>the tackling ready in due order; and above spread the sail, stretching 
<A NAME="726"></A>it taut with the sheets from the yard-arm.  And a fresh breeze wafted the 
<A NAME="727"></A>ship on. And soon they saw a fair island, Anthemoessa, where the clear- 
<A NAME="728"></A>voiced Sirens, daughters of Achelous, used to beguile with their sweet 
<A NAME="729"></A>songs whoever cast anchor there, and then destroy him. Them lovely Terpsichore, 
<A NAME="730"></A>one of the Muses, bare, united with Achelous; and once they tended Demeter's 
<A NAME="731"></A>noble daughter still unwed, and sang to her in chorus; and at that time 
<A NAME="732"></A>they were fashioned in part like birds and in part like maidens to behold. 
<A NAME="733"></A>And ever on the watch from their place of prospect with its fair haven, 
<A NAME="734"></A>often from many had they taken away their sweet return, consuming them 
<A NAME="735"></A>with wasting desire; and suddenly to the heroes, too, they sent forth from 
<A NAME="736"></A>their lips a lily-like voice.  And they were already about to cast from 
<A NAME="737"></A>the ship the hawsers to the shore, had not Thracian Orpheus, son of Oeagrus, 
<A NAME="738"></A>stringing in his hands his Bistonian lyre, rung forth the hasty snatch 
<A NAME="739"></A>of a rippling melody so that their ears might be filled with the sound 
<A NAME="740"></A>of his twanging; and the lyre overcame the maidens' voice.  And the west 
<A NAME="741"></A>wind and the sounding wave rushing astern bore the ship on; and the Sirens 
<A NAME="742"></A>kept uttering their ceaseless song.  But even so the goodly son of Teleon 
<A NAME="743"></A>alone of the comrades leapt before them all from the polished bench into 
<A NAME="744"></A>the sea, even Butes, his soul melted by the clear ringing voice of the 
<A NAME="745"></A>Sirens; and he swam through the dark surge to mount the beach, poor wretch. 
<A NAME="746"></A> Quickly would they have robbed him of his return then and there, but the 
<A NAME="747"></A>goddess that rules Eryx, Cypris, in pity snatched him away, while yet in 
<A NAME="748"></A>the eddies, and graciously meeting him saved him to dwell on the Lilybean 
<A NAME="749"></A>height.  And the heroes, seized by anguish, left the Sirens, but other 
<A NAME="750"></A>perils still worse, destructive to ships, awaited them in the meeting-place 
<A NAME="751"></A>of the seas.
<A NAME="752"></A><BR><BR>For on one side appeared the smooth rock of Scylla; on the other 
<A NAME="753"></A>Charybdis ceaselessly spouted and roared; in another part the Wandering 
<A NAME="754"></A>rocks were booming beneath the mighty surge, where before the burning flame 
<A NAME="755"></A>spurted forth from the top of the crags, above the rock glowing with fire, 
<A NAME="756"></A>and the air was misty with smoke, nor could you have seen the sun's light. 
<A NAME="757"></A> Then, though Hephaestus had ceased from his toils, the sea was still sending 
<A NAME="758"></A>up a warm vapour.  Hereupon on this side and on that the daughters of Nereus 
<A NAME="759"></A>met them; and behind, lady Thetis set her hand to the rudder-blade, to 
<A NAME="760"></A>guide them amid the Wandering rocks. And as when in fair weather herds 
<A NAME="761"></A>of dolphins come up from the depths and sport in circles round a ship as 
<A NAME="762"></A>it speeds along, now seen in front, now behind, now again at the side and 
<A NAME="763"></A>delight comes to the sailors; so the Nereids darted upward and circled 
<A NAME="764"></A>in their ranks round the ship Argo, while Thetis guided its course. And 
<A NAME="765"></A>when they were about to touch the Wandering rocks, straightway they raised 
<A NAME="766"></A>the edge of their garments over their snow-white knees, and aloft, on the 
<A NAME="767"></A>very rocks and where the waves broke, they hurried along on this side and 
<A NAME="768"></A>on that apart from one another.  And the ship was raised aloft as the current 
<A NAME="769"></A>smote her, and all around the furious wave mounting up broke over the rocks, 
<A NAME="770"></A>which at one time touched the sky like towering crags, at another, down 
<A NAME="771"></A>in the depths, were fixed fast at the bottom of the sea and the fierce 
<A NAME="772"></A>waves poured over them in floods.  And the Nereids, even as maidens near 
<A NAME="773"></A>some sandy beach roll their garments up to their waists out of their way 
<A NAME="774"></A>and sport with a shapely-rounded ball; then they catch it one from another 
<A NAME="775"></A>and send it high into the air; and it never touches the ground; so they 
<A NAME="776"></A>in turn one from another sent the ship through the air over the waves, 
<A NAME="777"></A>as it sped on ever away from the rocks; and round them the water spouted 
<A NAME="778"></A>and foamed.  And lord Hephaestus himself standing on the summit of a smooth 
<A NAME="779"></A>rock and resting his massy shoulder on the handle of his hammer, beheld 
<A NAME="780"></A>them, and the spouse of Zeus beheld them as she stood above the gleaming 
<A NAME="781"></A>heaven; and she threw her arms round Athena, such fear seized her as she 
<A NAME="782"></A>gazed.  And as long as the space of a day is lengthened out in springtime, 
<A NAME="783"></A>so long a time did they toil, heaving the ship between the loud-echoing 
<A NAME="784"></A>rocks; then again the heroes caught the wind and sped onward; and swiftly 
<A NAME="785"></A>they passed the mead of Thrinacia, where the kine of Helios fed.  There 
<A NAME="786"></A>the nymphs, like sea-mews, plunged beneath the depths, when they had fulfilled 
<A NAME="787"></A>the behests of the spouse of Zeus.  And at the same time the bleating of 
<A NAME="788"></A>sheep came to the heroes through the mist and the lowing of kine, near 
<A NAME="789"></A>at hand, smote their ears.  And over the dewy leas Phaethusa, the youngest 
<A NAME="790"></A>of the daughters of Helios, tended the sheep, bearing in her hand a silver 
<A NAME="791"></A>crook; while Lampetia, herding the kine, wielded a staff of glowing orichalcum 
<A NAME="792"></A> as she followed.  These kine the heroes saw feeding by the river's stream, 
<A NAME="793"></A>over the plain and the water-meadow; not one of them was dark in hue but 
<A NAME="794"></A>all were white as milk and glorying in their horns of gold.  So they passed 
<A NAME="795"></A>them by in the day-time, and when night came on they were cleaving a great 
<A NAME="796"></A>sea-gulf, rejoicing, until again early rising dawn threw light upon their 
<A NAME="797"></A>course.
<A NAME="798"></A><BR><BR>Fronting the Ionian gulf there lies an island in the Ceraunian 
<A NAME="799"></A>sea, rich in soil, with a harbour on both sides, beneath which lies the 
<A NAME="800"></A>sickle, as legend saith--grant me grace, O Muses, not willingly do I tell 
<A NAME="801"></A>this tale of olden days -- wherewith Cronos pitilessly mutilated his father; 
<A NAME="802"></A>but others call it the reaping-hook of Demeter, goddess of the nether world. 
<A NAME="803"></A> For Demeter once dwelt in that island, and taught the Titans to reap the 
<A NAME="804"></A>ears of corn, all for the love of Macris.  Whence it is called Drepane, 
<A NAME="805"></A> the sacred nurse of the Phaeacians; and thus the Phaeacians themselves 
<A NAME="806"></A>are by birth of the blood of Uranus. To them came Argo, held fast by many 
<A NAME="807"></A>toils, borne by the breezes from the Thrinacian sea; and Alcinous and his 
<A NAME="808"></A>people with kindly sacrifice gladly welcomed their coming; and over them 
<A NAME="809"></A>all the city made merry; thou wouldst say they were rejoicing over their 
<A NAME="810"></A>own sons.  And the heroes themselves strode in gladness through the throng, 
<A NAME="811"></A>even as though they had set foot in the heart of Haemonia; but soon were 
<A NAME="812"></A>they to arm and raise the battle-cry; so near to them appeared a boundless 
<A NAME="813"></A>host of Colchians, who had passed through the mouth of Pontus and between 
<A NAME="814"></A>the Cyanean rocks in search of the chieftains.  They desired forthwith 
<A NAME="815"></A>to carry off Medea to her father's house apart from the rest, or else they 
<A NAME="816"></A>threatened with fierce cruelty to raise the dread war-cry both then and 
<A NAME="817"></A>thereafter on the coming of Aeetes.  But lordly Alcinous checked them amid 
<A NAME="818"></A>their eagerness for war.  For he longed to allay the lawless strife between 
<A NAME="819"></A>both sides without the clash of battle.  And the maiden in deadly fear 
<A NAME="820"></A>often implored the comrades of Aeson's son, and often with her hands touched 
<A NAME="821"></A>the knees of Arete, the bride of Aleinous:
<A NAME="822"></A><BR><BR>"I beseech thee, O queen, be gracious and deliver me not to the 
<A NAME="823"></A>Colchians to be borne to my father, if thou thyself too art one of the 
<A NAME="824"></A>race of mortals, whose heart rushes swiftly to ruin from light transgressions. 
<A NAME="825"></A> For my firm sense forsook me--it was not for wantonness.  Be witness the 
<A NAME="826"></A>sacred light of Helios, be witness the rites of the maiden that wanders 
<A NAME="827"></A>by night, daughter of Perses.  Not willingly did I haste from my home with 
<A NAME="828"></A>men of an alien race; but a horrible fear wrought on me to bethink me of 
<A NAME="829"></A>flight when I sinned; other device was there none.  Still my maiden's girdle 
<A NAME="830"></A>remains, as in the halls of my father, unstained, untouched.  Pity me, 
<A NAME="831"></A>lady, and turn thy lord to mercy; and may the immortals grant thee a perfect 
<A NAME="832"></A>life, and joy, and children, and the glory of a city 
<A NAME="833"></A>unravaged!"
<A NAME="834"></A><BR><BR>Thus did she implore Arete, shedding tears, and thus each of the 
<A NAME="835"></A>chieftains in turn:
<A NAME="836"></A><BR><BR>"On your account, ye men of peerless might, and on account of my 
<A NAME="837"></A>toils in your ventures am I sorely afflicted; even I, by whose help ye 
<A NAME="838"></A>yoked the bulls, and reaped the deadly harvest of the earthborn men; even 
<A NAME="839"></A>I, through whom on your homeward path ye shall bear to Haemonia the golden 
<A NAME="840"></A>fleece.  Lo, here am I, who have lost my country and my parents, who have 
<A NAME="841"></A>lost my home and all the delights of life; to you have I restored your 
<A NAME="842"></A>country and your homes; with eyes of gladness ye will see again your parents; 
<A NAME="843"></A>but from me a heavy-handed god has raft all joy; and with strangers I wander, 
<A NAME="844"></A>an accursed thing.  Fear your covenant and your oaths, fear the Fury that 
<A NAME="845"></A>avenges suppliants and the retribution of heaven, if I fall into Aeetes' 
<A NAME="846"></A>hands and am slain with grievous outrage.  To no shrines, no tower of defence, 
<A NAME="847"></A>no other refuge do I pay heed, but only to you.  Hard and pitiless in your 
<A NAME="848"></A>cruelty!  No reverence have ye for me in your heart though ye see me helpless, 
<A NAME="849"></A>stretching my hands towards the knees of a stranger queen; yet, when ye 
<A NAME="850"></A>longed to seize the fleece, ye would have met all the Colchians face to 
<A NAME="851"></A>thee and haughty Aeetes himself; but now ye have forgotten your courage, 
<A NAME="852"></A>now that they are all alone and cut off."
<A NAME="853"></A><BR><BR>Thus she spake, beseeching; and to whomsoever she bowed in prayer, 
<A NAME="854"></A>that man tried to give her heart and to check her anguish.  And in their 
<A NAME="855"></A>hands they shook their sharp pointed spears, and drew the swords from their 
<A NAME="856"></A>sheaths; and they swore they would not hold back from giving succour, if 
<A NAME="857"></A>she should meet with an unrighteous judgement.  And the host were all wearied 
<A NAME="858"></A>and Night came on them, Night that puts to rest the works of men, and lulled 
<A NAME="859"></A>all the earth to sleep; but to the maid no sleep brought rest, but in her 
<A NAME="860"></A>bosom her heart was wrung with anguish.  Even as when a toiling woman turns 
<A NAME="861"></A>her spindle through the night, and round her moan her orphan children, 
<A NAME="862"></A>for she is a widow, and down her cheeks fall the tears, as she bethinks 
<A NAME="863"></A>her how dreary a lot hath seized her; so Medea's cheeks were wet; and her 
<A NAME="864"></A>heart within her was in agony, pierced with sharp pain.
<A NAME="865"></A><BR><BR>Now within the palace in the city, as aforetime, lay lordly Alcinous 
<A NAME="866"></A>and Arete, the revered wife of Alcinous, and on their couch through the 
<A NAME="867"></A>night they were devising plans about the maiden; and him, as her wedded 
<A NAME="868"></A>husband, the wife addressed with loving words:
<A NAME="869"></A><BR><BR>"Yea, my friend, come, save the woe-stricken maid from the Colchians 
<A NAME="870"></A>and show grace to the Minyae.  Argos is near our isle and the men of Haemonia; 
<A NAME="871"></A>but Aeetes dwells not near, nor do we know of Aeetes one whit: we hear 
<A NAME="872"></A>but his name; but this maiden of dread suffering hath broken my heart by 
<A NAME="873"></A>her prayers.  O king, give her not up to the Colchians to be borne back 
<A NAME="874"></A>to her father's home.  She was distraught when first she gave him the drugs 
<A NAME="875"></A>to charm the oxen; and next, to cure one ill by another, as in our sinning 
<A NAME="876"></A>we do often, she fled from her haughty sire's heavy wrath.  But Jason, 
<A NAME="877"></A>as I hear, is bound to her by mighty oaths that he will make her his wedded 
<A NAME="878"></A>wife within his halls.  Wherefore, my friend, make not, of thy will, Aeson's 
<A NAME="879"></A>son to be forsworn, nor let the father, if thou canst help, work with angry 
<A NAME="880"></A>heart some intolerable mischief on his child.  For fathers are all too 
<A NAME="881"></A>jealous against their children; what wrong did Nycteus devise against Antiope, 
<A NAME="882"></A>fair of face!  What woes did Danae endure on the wide sea through her sire's 
<A NAME="883"></A>mad rage!  Of late, and not far away, Echetus in wanton cruelty thrust 
<A NAME="884"></A>spikes of bronze in his daughter's eyes; and by a grievous fate is she 
<A NAME="885"></A>wasting away, grinding grains of bronze in a dungeon's 
<A NAME="886"></A>gloom."
<A NAME="887"></A><BR><BR>Thus she spake, beseeching; and by his wife's words his heart was 
<A NAME="888"></A>softened, and thus he spake:
<A NAME="889"></A><BR><BR>"Arete, with arms I could drive forth the Colchians, showing grace 
<A NAME="890"></A>to the heroes for the maiden's sake. But I fear to set at nought the righteous 
<A NAME="891"></A>judgment of Zeus.  Nor is it well to take no thought of Aeetes, as thou 
<A NAME="892"></A>sayest: for none is more lordly than Aeetes.  And, if he willed, he might 
<A NAME="893"></A>bring war upon Hellas, though he dwell afar.  Wherefore it is right for 
<A NAME="894"></A>me to deliver the judgement that in all men's eyes shall be best; and I 
<A NAME="895"></A>will not hide it from thee.  If she be yet a maid I decree that they carry 
<A NAME="896"></A>her back to her father; but if she shares a husband's bed, I will not separate 
<A NAME="897"></A>her from her lord; nor, if she bear a child beneath her breast, will I 
<A NAME="898"></A>give it up to an enemy."
<A NAME="899"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spake, and at once sleep laid him to rest.  And she stored 
<A NAME="900"></A>up in her heart the word of wisdom, and straightway rose from her couch 
<A NAME="901"></A>and went through the palace; and her handmaids came hasting together, eagerly 
<A NAME="902"></A>tending their mistress.  But quietly she summoned her herald and addressed 
<A NAME="903"></A>him, in her prudence urging Aeson's son to wed the maiden, and not to implore 
<A NAME="904"></A>Alcinous; for he himself, she said, will decree to the Colchians that if 
<A NAME="905"></A>she is still a maid he will deliver her up to be borne to her father's 
<A NAME="906"></A>house, but that if she shares a husband's bed he will not sever her from 
<A NAME="907"></A>wedded love.
<A NAME="908"></A><BR><BR>Thus she spake, and quickly from the hall his feet bore him, that 
<A NAME="909"></A>he might declare to Jason the fair-omened speech of Arete and the counsel 
<A NAME="910"></A>of godfearing Alcinous.  And he found the heroes watching in full armour 
<A NAME="911"></A>in the haven of Hyllus, near the city; and out he spake the whole message; 
<A NAME="912"></A>and each hero's heart rejoiced; for the word that he spake was 
<A NAME="913"></A>welcome.
<A NAME="914"></A><BR><BR>And straightway they mingled a bowl to the blessed ones, as is 
<A NAME="915"></A>right, and reverently led sheep to the altar, and for that very night prepared 
<A NAME="916"></A>for the maiden the bridal couch in the sacred cave, where once dwelt Macris, 
<A NAME="917"></A>the daughter of Aristaeus, lord of honey, who discovered the works of bees 
<A NAME="918"></A>and the fatness of the olive, the fruit of labour.  She it was that first 
<A NAME="919"></A>received in her bosom the Nysean son of Zeus in Abantian Euboea, and with 
<A NAME="920"></A>honey moistened his parched lips when Hermes bore him out of the flame. 
<A NAME="921"></A> And Hera beheld it, and in wrath drove her from the whole island.  And 
<A NAME="922"></A>she accordingly came to dwell far off, in the sacred cave of the Phaeacians, 
<A NAME="923"></A>and granted boundless wealth to the inhabitants.  There at that time did 
<A NAME="924"></A>they spread a mighty couch; and thereon they laid the glittering fleece 
<A NAME="925"></A>of gold, that so the marriage might be made honoured and the theme of song. 
<A NAME="926"></A> And for them nymphs gathered flowers of varied hue and bore them thither 
<A NAME="927"></A>in their white bosoms; and a splendour as of flame played round them all, 
<A NAME="928"></A>such a light gleamed from the golden tufts.  And in their eyes it kindled 
<A NAME="929"></A>a sweet longing; yet for all her desire, awe withheld each one from laying 
<A NAME="930"></A>her hand thereon.  Some were called daughters of the river Aegaeus; others 
<A NAME="931"></A>dwelt round the crests of the Meliteian mount; and others were woodland 
<A NAME="932"></A>nymphs from the plains.  For Hera herself, the spouse of Zeus, had sent 
<A NAME="933"></A>them to do honour to Jason. That cave is to this day called the sacred 
<A NAME="934"></A>cave of Medea, where they spread the fine and fragrant linen and brought 
<A NAME="935"></A>these two together.  And the heroes in their hands wielded their spears 
<A NAME="936"></A>for war, lest first a host of foes should burst upon them for battle unawares, 
<A NAME="937"></A>and, their heads enwreathed with leafy sprays, all in harmony, while Orpheus' 
<A NAME="938"></A>harp rang clear, sang the marriage song at the entrance to the bridal chamber. 
<A NAME="939"></A> Yet not in the house of Alcinous was the hero, Aeson's son, minded to 
<A NAME="940"></A>complete his marriage, but in his father's hall when he had returned home 
<A NAME="941"></A>to Ioleus; and such was the mind of Medea herself; but necessity led them 
<A NAME="942"></A>to wed at this time.  For never in truth do we tribes of woe-stricken mortals 
<A NAME="943"></A>tread the path of delight with sure foot; but still some bitter affliction 
<A NAME="944"></A>keeps pace with our joy. Wherefore they too, though their souls were melted 
<A NAME="945"></A>with sweet love, were held by fear, whether the sentence of Alcinous would 
<A NAME="946"></A>be fulfilled.
<A NAME="947"></A><BR><BR>Now dawn returning with her beams divine scattered the gloomy night 
<A NAME="948"></A>through the sky; and the island beaches laughed out and the paths over 
<A NAME="949"></A>the plains far off, drenched with dew, and there was a din in the streets; 
<A NAME="950"></A>the people were astir throughout the city, and far away the Colchians were 
<A NAME="951"></A>astir at the bounds of the isle of Macris.  And straightway to them went 
<A NAME="952"></A>Alcinous, by reason of his covenant, to declare his purpose concerning 
<A NAME="953"></A>the maiden, and in his hand he held a golden staff, his staff of justice, 
<A NAME="954"></A>whereby the people had righteous judgments meted out to them throughout 
<A NAME="955"></A>the city.  And with him in order due and arrayed in their harness of war 
<A NAME="956"></A>went marching, band by band, the chiefs of the Phaeacians.  And from the 
<A NAME="957"></A>towers came forth the women in crowds to gaze upon the heroes; and the 
<A NAME="958"></A>country folk came to meet them when they heard the news, for Hera had sent 
<A NAME="959"></A>forth a true report.  And one led the chosen ram of his flock, and another 
<A NAME="960"></A>a heifer that had never toiled; and others set hard by jars of wine for 
<A NAME="961"></A>mixing; and the smoke of sacrifice leapt up far away.  And women bore fine 
<A NAME="962"></A>linen, the fruit of much toil, as women will, and gifts of gold and varied 
<A NAME="963"></A>ornaments as well, such as are brought to newly-wedded brides; and they 
<A NAME="964"></A>marvelled when they saw the shapely forms and beauty of the gallant heroes, 
<A NAME="965"></A>and among them the son of Oeagrus, oft beating the ground with gleaming 
<A NAME="966"></A>sandal, to the time of his loud-ringing lyre and song. And all the nymphs 
<A NAME="967"></A>together, whenever he recalled the marriage, uplifted the lovely bridal-chant; 
<A NAME="968"></A>and at times again they sang alone as they circled in the dance, Hera, 
<A NAME="969"></A>in thy honour; for it was thou that didst put it into the heart of Arete 
<A NAME="970"></A>to proclaim the wise word of Alcinous.  And as soon as he had uttered the 
<A NAME="971"></A>decree of his righteous judgement, and the completion of the marriage had 
<A NAME="972"></A>been proclaimed, he took care that thus it should abide fixed; and no deadly 
<A NAME="973"></A>fear touched him nor Aeetes' grievous wrath, but he kept his judgement 
<A NAME="974"></A>fast bound by unbroken oaths. So when the Colchians learnt that they were 
<A NAME="975"></A>beseeching in vain and he bade them either observe his judgements or hold 
<A NAME="976"></A>their ships away from his harbours and land, then they began to dread the 
<A NAME="977"></A>threats of their own king and besought Alcinous to receive them as comrades; 
<A NAME="978"></A>and there in the island long time they dwelt with the Phaeacians, until 
<A NAME="979"></A>in the course of years, the Bacchiadae, a race sprung from Ephyra,  settled 
<A NAME="980"></A>among them; and the Colchians passed to an island opposite; and thence 
<A NAME="981"></A>they were destined to reach the Ceraunian hills of the Abantes, and the 
<A NAME="982"></A>Nestaeans and Oricum; but all this was fulfilled after long ages had passed. 
<A NAME="983"></A> And still the altars which Medea built on the spot sacred to Apollo, god 
<A NAME="984"></A>of shepherds, receive yearly sacrifices in honour of the Fates and the 
<A NAME="985"></A>Nymphs.  And when the Minyae departed many gifts of friendship did Alcinous 
<A NAME="986"></A>bestow, and many Arete; moreover she gave Medea twelve Phaeacian handmaids 
<A NAME="987"></A>from the palace, to bear her company.  And on the seventh day they left 
<A NAME="988"></A>Drepane; and at dawn came a fresh breeze from Zeus. And onward they sped 
<A NAME="989"></A>borne along by the wind's breath.  Howbeit not yet was it ordained for 
<A NAME="990"></A>the heroes to set foot on Achaea, until they had toiled even in the furthest 
<A NAME="991"></A>bounds of Libya.
<A NAME="992"></A><BR><BR>Now had they left behind the gulf named after the Ambracians, now 
<A NAME="993"></A>with sails wide spread the land of the Curetes, and next in order the narrow 
<A NAME="994"></A>islands with the Echinades, and the land of Pelops was just descried; even 
<A NAME="995"></A>then a baleful blast of the north wind seized them in mid-course and swept 
<A NAME="996"></A>them towards the Libyan sea nine nights and as many days, until they came 
<A NAME="997"></A>far within Syrtis, wherefrom is no return for ships, when they are once 
<A NAME="998"></A>forced into that gulf.  For on every hand are shoals, on every hand masses 
<A NAME="999"></A>of seaweed from the depths; and over them the light foam of the wave washes 
<A NAME="1000"></A>without noise; and there is a stretch of sand to the dim horizon; and there 
<A NAME="1001"></A>moveth nothing that creeps or flies.  Here accordingly the flood-tide--for 
<A NAME="1002"></A>this tide often retreats from the land and bursts back again over the beach 
<A NAME="1003"></A>coming on with a rush and roar--thrust them suddenly on to the innermost 
<A NAME="1004"></A>shore, and but little of the keel was left in the water.  And they leapt 
<A NAME="1005"></A>forth from the ship, and sorrow seized them when they gazed on the mist 
<A NAME="1006"></A>and the levels of vast land stretching far like a mist and continuous into 
<A NAME="1007"></A>the distance; no spot for water, no path, no steading of herdsmen did they 
<A NAME="1008"></A>descry afar off, but all the scene was possessed by a dead calm.  And thus 
<A NAME="1009"></A>did one hero, vexed in spirit, ask another:
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR><BR>"What land is this?  Whither has the tempest hurled us?  Would 
<A NAME="1011"></A>that, reckless of deadly fear, we had dared to rush on by that same path 
<A NAME="1012"></A>between the clashing rocks!  Better were it to have overleapt the will 
<A NAME="1013"></A>of Zeus and perished in venturing some mighty deed.  But now what should 
<A NAME="1014"></A>we do, held back by the winds to stay here, if ever so short a time?  How 
<A NAME="1015"></A>desolate looms before us the edge of the limitless land!"
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR><BR>Thus one spake; and among them Ancaeus the helmsman, in despair 
<A NAME="1017"></A>at their evil case, spoke with grieving heart: "Verily we are undone by 
<A NAME="1018"></A>a terrible doom; there is no escape from ruin; we must suffer the cruellest 
<A NAME="1019"></A>woes, having fallen on this desolation, even though breezes should blow 
<A NAME="1020"></A>from the land; for, as I gaze far around, on every side do I behold a sea 
<A NAME="1021"></A>of shoals, and masses of water, fretted line upon line, run over the hoary 
<A NAME="1022"></A>sand.  And miserably long ago would our sacred ship have been shattered 
<A NAME="1023"></A>far from the shore; but the tide itself bore her high on to the land from 
<A NAME="1024"></A>the deep sea.  But now the tide rushes back to the sea, and only the foam, 
<A NAME="1025"></A>whereon no ship can sail, rolls round us, just covering the land.  Wherefore 
<A NAME="1026"></A>I deem that all hope of our voyage and of our return is cut off.  Let someone 
<A NAME="1027"></A>else show his skill; let him sit at the helm the man that is eager for 
<A NAME="1028"></A>our deliverance.  But Zeus has no will to fulfil our day of return after 
<A NAME="1029"></A>all our toils."
<A NAME="1030"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spake with tears, and all of them that had knowledge of 
<A NAME="1031"></A>ships agreed thereto; but the hearts of all grew numb, and pallor overspread 
<A NAME="1032"></A>their cheeks.  And as, like lifeless spectres, men roam through a city 
<A NAME="1033"></A>awaiting the issue of war or of pestilence, or some mighty storm which 
<A NAME="1034"></A>overwhelms the countless labours of oxen, when the images of their own 
<A NAME="1035"></A>accord sweat and run down with blood, and bellowings are heard in temples, 
<A NAME="1036"></A>or when at mid-day the sun draws on night from heaven, and the stars shine 
<A NAME="1037"></A>clear through the mist; so at that time along the endless strand the chieftains 
<A NAME="1038"></A>wandered, groping their way.  Then straightway dark evening came upon them; 
<A NAME="1039"></A>and piteously did they embrace each other and say farewell with tears, 
<A NAME="1040"></A>that they might, each one apart from his fellow, fall on the sand and die. 
<A NAME="1041"></A> And this way and that they went further to choose a resting-place; and 
<A NAME="1042"></A>they wrapped their heads in their cloaks and, fasting and unfed, lay down 
<A NAME="1043"></A>all that night and the day, awaiting a piteous death.  But apart the maidens 
<A NAME="1044"></A>huddled together lamented beside the daughter of Aeetes.  And as when, 
<A NAME="1045"></A>forsaken by their mother, unfledged birds that have fallen from a cleft 
<A NAME="1046"></A>in the rock chirp shrilly; or when by the banks of fair-flowing Pactolus, 
<A NAME="1047"></A>swans raise their song, and all around the dewy meadow echoes and the river's 
<A NAME="1048"></A>fair stream; so these maidens, laying in the dust their golden hair, all 
<A NAME="1049"></A>through the night wailed their piteous lament. And there all would have 
<A NAME="1050"></A>parted from life without a name and unknown to mortal men, those bravest 
<A NAME="1051"></A>of heroes, with their task unfulfilled; but as they pined in despair, the 
<A NAME="1052"></A>heroine-nymphs, warders of Libya, had pity on them, they who once found 
<A NAME="1053"></A>Athena, what time she leapt in gleaming armour from her father's head, 
<A NAME="1054"></A>and bathed her by Trito's waters.  It was noon-tide and the fiercest rays 
<A NAME="1055"></A>of the sun were scorching Libya; they stood near Aeson's son, and lightly 
<A NAME="1056"></A>drew the cloak from his head.  And the hero cast down his eyes and looked 
<A NAME="1057"></A>aside, in reverence for the goddesses, and as he lay bewildered all alone 
<A NAME="1058"></A>they addressed him openly with gentle words:
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR><BR>"Ill-starred one, why art thou so smitten with despair?  We know 
<A NAME="1060"></A>how ye went in quest of the golden fleece; we know each toil of yours, 
<A NAME="1061"></A>all the mighty deeds ye wrought in your wanderings over land and sea. 
<A NAME="1062"></A> We are the solitary ones, goddesses of the land, speaking with human voice, 
<A NAME="1063"></A>the heroines, Libya's warders and daughters.  Up then; be not thus afflicted 
<A NAME="1064"></A>in thy misery, and rouse thy comrades.  And when Amphitrite has straightway 
<A NAME="1065"></A>loosed Poseidon's swift-wheeled car, then do ye pay to your mother a recompense 
<A NAME="1066"></A>for all her travail when she bare you so long in her womb; and so ye may 
<A NAME="1067"></A>return to the divine land of Achaea."
<A NAME="1068"></A><BR><BR>Thus they spake, and with the voice vanished at once, where they 
<A NAME="1069"></A>stood.  But Jason sat upon the earth as he gazed around, and thus 
<A NAME="1070"></A>cried:
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR><BR>"Be gracious, noble goddesses of the desert, yet the saying about 
<A NAME="1072"></A>our return I understand not clearly.  Surely I will gather together my 
<A NAME="1073"></A>comrades and tell them, if haply we can find some token of our escape, 
<A NAME="1074"></A>for the counsel of many is better."
<A NAME="1075"></A><BR><BR>He spake, and leapt to his feet, and shouted afar to his comrades, 
<A NAME="1076"></A>all squalid with dust, like a lion when he roars through the woodland seeking 
<A NAME="1077"></A>his mate; and far off in the mountains the glens tremble at the thunder 
<A NAME="1078"></A>of his voice; and the oxen of the field and the herdsmen shudder with fear; 
<A NAME="1079"></A>yet to them Jason's voice was no whit terrible the voice of a comrade calling 
<A NAME="1080"></A>to his friends.  And with looks downcast they gathered near, and hard by 
<A NAME="1081"></A>where the ship lay he made them sit down in their grief and the women with 
<A NAME="1082"></A>them, and addressed them and told them everything:
<A NAME="1083"></A><BR><BR>"Listen, friends; as I lay in my grief, three goddesses girded 
<A NAME="1084"></A>with goat-skins from the neck downwards round the back and waist, like 
<A NAME="1085"></A>maidens, stood over my head nigh at hand; and they uncovered me, drawing 
<A NAME="1086"></A>my cloak away with light hand, and they bade me rise up myself and go and 
<A NAME="1087"></A>rouse you, and pay to our mother a bounteous recompense for all her travail 
<A NAME="1088"></A>when she bare us so long in her womb, when Amphitrite shall have loosed 
<A NAME="1089"></A>Poseidon's swift-wheeled car.  But I cannot fully understand concerning 
<A NAME="1090"></A>this divine message.  They said indeed that they were heroines, Libya's 
<A NAME="1091"></A>warders and daughters; and all the toils that we endured aforetime by land
