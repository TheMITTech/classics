<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Beginning with thee, O Phoebus, I will recount the famous deeds of men 
<A NAME="11"></A>of old, who, at the behest of King Pelias, down through the mouth of Pontus 
<A NAME="12"></A>and between the Cyanean rocks, sped well-benched Argo in quest of the golden 
<A NAME="13"></A>fleece.
<A NAME="14"></A><BR><BR>Such was the oracle that Pelias heard, that a hateful doom awaited 
<A NAME="15"></A>him to be slain at the prompting of the man whom he should see coming forth 
<A NAME="16"></A>from the people with but one sandal.  And no long time after, in accordance 
<A NAME="17"></A>with that true report, Jason crossed the stream of wintry Anaurus on foot, 
<A NAME="18"></A>and saved one sandal from the mire, but the other he left in the depths 
<A NAME="19"></A>held back by the flood.  And straightway he came to Pelias to share the 
<A NAME="20"></A>banquet which the king was offering to his father Poseidon and the rest 
<A NAME="21"></A>of the gods, though he paid no honour to Pelasgian Hera.  Quickly the king 
<A NAME="22"></A>saw him and pondered, and devised for him the toil of a troublous voyage, 
<A NAME="23"></A>in order that on the sea or among strangers he might lose his 
<A NAME="24"></A>home-return.
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><BR>The ship, as former bards relate, Argus wrought by the guidance 
<A NAME="26"></A>of Athena.  But now I will tell the lineage and the names of the heroes, 
<A NAME="27"></A>and of the long sea-paths and the deeds they wrought in their wanderings; 
<A NAME="28"></A>may the Muses be the inspirers of my song!
<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR>First then let us name Orpheus whom once Calliope bare, it is said, 
<A NAME="30"></A>wedded to Thracian Oeagrus, near the Pimpleian height.  Men say that he 
<A NAME="31"></A>by the music of his songs charmed the stubborn rocks upon the mountains 
<A NAME="32"></A>and the course of rivers.  And the wild oak-trees to this day, tokens of 
<A NAME="33"></A>that magic strain, that grow at Zone on the Thracian shore, stand in ordered 
<A NAME="34"></A>ranks close together, the same which under the charm of his lyre he led 
<A NAME="35"></A>down from Pieria.  Such then was Orpheus whom Aeson's son welcomed to share 
<A NAME="36"></A>his toils, in obedience to the behest of Cheiron, Orpheus ruler of Bistonian 
<A NAME="37"></A>Pieria.
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR>Straightway came Asterion, whom Cometes begat by the waters of 
<A NAME="39"></A>eddying Apidanus; he dwelt at Peiresiae near the Phylleian mount, where 
<A NAME="40"></A>mighty Apidanus and bright Enipeus join their streams, coming together 
<A NAME="41"></A>from afar.
<A NAME="42"></A><BR><BR>Next to them from Larisa came Polyphemus, son of Eilatus, who aforetime 
<A NAME="43"></A>among the mighty Lapithae, when they were arming themselves against the 
<A NAME="44"></A>Centaurs, fought in his younger days; now his limbs were grown heavy with 
<A NAME="45"></A>age, but his martial spirit still remained, even as of 
<A NAME="46"></A>old.
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR>Nor was Iphiclus long left behind in Phylace, the uncle of Aeson's 
<A NAME="48"></A>son; for Aeson had wedded his sister Alcimede, daughter of Phylacus: his 
<A NAME="49"></A>kinship with her bade him be numbered in the host.
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR>Nor did Admetus, the lord of Pherae rich in sheep, stay behind 
<A NAME="51"></A>beneath the peak of the Chalcodonian mount.
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR>Nor at Alope stayed the sons of Hermes, rich in corn-land, well 
<A NAME="53"></A>skilled in craftiness, Erytus and Echion, and with them on their departure 
<A NAME="54"></A>their kinsman Aethalides went as the third; him near the streams of Amphrysus 
<A NAME="55"></A>Eupolemeia bare, the daughter of Myrmidon, from Phthia; the two others 
<A NAME="56"></A>were sprung from Antianeira, daughter of Menetes.
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR>From rich Gyrton came Coronus, son of Caeneus, brave, but not braver 
<A NAME="58"></A>than his father.  For bards relate that Caeneus though still living perished 
<A NAME="59"></A>at the hands of the Centaurs, when apart from other chiefs he routed them; 
<A NAME="60"></A>and they, rallying against him, could neither bend nor slay him; but unconquered 
<A NAME="61"></A>and unflinching he passed beneath the earth, overwhelmed by the downrush 
<A NAME="62"></A>of massy pines.
<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR>There came too Titaresian Mopsus, whom above all men the son of 
<A NAME="64"></A>Leto taught the augury of birds; and Eurydamas the son of Ctimenus; he 
<A NAME="65"></A>dwelt at Dolopian Ctimene near the Xynian lake.
<A NAME="66"></A><BR><BR>Moreover Actor sent his son Menoetius from Opus that he might accompany 
<A NAME="67"></A>the chiefs.
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR>Eurytion followed and strong Eribotes, one the son of Teleon, the 
<A NAME="69"></A>other of Irus, Actor's son; the son of Teleon renowned Eribotes, and of 
<A NAME="70"></A>Irus Eurytion.  A third with them was Oileus, peerless in courage and well 
<A NAME="71"></A>skilled to attack the flying foe, when they break their 
<A NAME="72"></A>ranks.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>Now from Euboea came Canthus eager for the quest, whom Canethus 
<A NAME="74"></A>son of Abas sent; but he was not destined to return to Cerinthus.  For 
<A NAME="75"></A>fate had ordained that he and Mopsus, skilled in the seer's art, should 
<A NAME="76"></A>wander and perish in the furthest ends of Libya.  For no ill is too remote 
<A NAME="77"></A>for mortals to incur, seeing that they buried them in Libya, as far from 
<A NAME="78"></A>the Colchians as is the space that is seen between the setting and the 
<A NAME="79"></A>rising of the sun.
<A NAME="80"></A><BR><BR>To him Clytius and Iphitus joined themselves, the warders of Oechalia, 
<A NAME="81"></A>sons of Eurytus the ruthless, Eurytus, to whom the Far-shooting god gave 
<A NAME="82"></A>his bow; but he had no joy of the gift; for of his own choice he strove 
<A NAME="83"></A>even with the giver.
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><BR>After them came the sons of Aeacus, not both together, nor from 
<A NAME="85"></A>the same spot; for they settled far from Aegina in exile, when in their 
<A NAME="86"></A>folly they had slain their brother Phoeus.  Telamon dwelt in the Attic 
<A NAME="87"></A>island; but Peleus departed and made his home in Phthia.
<A NAME="88"></A><BR><BR>After them from Cecropia came warlike Butes, son of brave Teleon, 
<A NAME="89"></A>and Phalerus of the ashen spear.  Alcon his father sent him forth; yet 
<A NAME="90"></A>no other sons had he to care for his old age and livelihood.  But him, 
<A NAME="91"></A>his well-beloved and only son, he sent forth that amid bold heroes he might 
<A NAME="92"></A>shine conspicuous.  But Theseus, who surpassed all the sons of Erechtheus, 
<A NAME="93"></A>an unseen bond kept beneath the land of Taenarus, for he had followed that 
<A NAME="94"></A>path with Peirithous; assuredly both would have lightened for all the fulfilment 
<A NAME="95"></A>of their toil.
<A NAME="96"></A><BR><BR>Tiphys, son of Hagnias, left the Siphaean people of the Thespians, 
<A NAME="97"></A>well skilled to foretell the rising wave on the broad sea, and well skilled 
<A NAME="98"></A>to infer from sun and star the stormy winds and the time for sailing. 
<A NAME="99"></A> Tritonian Athena herself urged him to join the band of chiefs, and he 
<A NAME="100"></A>came among them a welcome comrade.  She herself too fashioned the swift 
<A NAME="101"></A>ship; and with her Argus, son of Arestor, wrought it by her counsels. 
<A NAME="102"></A> Wherefore it proved the most excellent of all ships that have made trial 
<A NAME="103"></A>of the sea with oars.
<A NAME="104"></A><BR><BR>After them came Phlias from Araethyrea, where he dwelt in affluence 
<A NAME="105"></A>by the favour of his father Dionysus, in his home by the springs of 
<A NAME="106"></A>Asopus.
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR>From Argos came Talaus and Areius, sons of Bias, and mighty Leodocus, 
<A NAME="108"></A>all of whom Pero daughter of Neleus bare; on her account the Aeolid Melampus 
<A NAME="109"></A>endured sore affliction in the steading of Iphiclus.
<A NAME="110"></A><BR><BR>Nor do we learn that Heracles of the mighty heart disregarded the 
<A NAME="111"></A>eager summons of Aeson's son.  But when he heard a report of the heroes' 
<A NAME="112"></A>gathering and had reached Lyrceian Argos from Arcadia by the road along 
<A NAME="113"></A>which he carried the boar alive that fed in the thickets of Lampeia, near 
<A NAME="114"></A>the vast Erymanthian swamp, the boar bound with chains he put down from 
<A NAME="115"></A>his huge shoulders at the entrance to the market-place of Mycenae; and 
<A NAME="116"></A>himself of his own will set out against the purpose of Eurystheus; and 
<A NAME="117"></A>with him went Hylas, a brave comrade, in the flower of youth, to bear his 
<A NAME="118"></A>arrows and to guard his bow.
<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR>Next to him came a scion of the race of divine Danaus, Nauplius. 
<A NAME="120"></A> He was the son of Clytonaeus son of Naubolus; Naubolus was son of Lernus; 
<A NAME="121"></A>Lernus we know was the son of Proetus son of Nauplius; and once Amymone 
<A NAME="122"></A>daughter of Danaus, wedded to Poseidon, bare Nauplius, who surpassed all 
<A NAME="123"></A>men in naval skill.
<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR>Idmon came last of all them that dwelt at Argos, for though he 
<A NAME="125"></A>had learnt his own fate by augury, he came, that the people might not grudge 
<A NAME="126"></A>him fair renown.  He was not in truth the son of Abas, but Leto's son himself 
<A NAME="127"></A>begat him to be numbered among the illustrious Aeolids; and himself taught 
<A NAME="128"></A>him the art of prophecy--to pay heed to birds and to observe the signs 
<A NAME="129"></A>of the burning sacrifice.
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR>Moreover Aetolian Leda sent from Sparta strong Polydeuces and Castor, 
<A NAME="131"></A>skilled to guide swift-footed steeds; these her dearly-loved sons she bare 
<A NAME="132"></A>at one birth in the house of Tyndareus; nor did she forbid their departure; 
<A NAME="133"></A>for she had thoughts worthy of the bride of Zeus.
<A NAME="134"></A><BR><BR>The sons of Aphareus, Lynceus and proud Idas, came from Arene, 
<A NAME="135"></A>both exulting in their great strength; and Lynceus too excelled in keenest 
<A NAME="136"></A>sight, if the report is true that that hero could easily direct his sight 
<A NAME="137"></A>even beneath the earth.
<A NAME="138"></A><BR><BR>And with them Neleian Periclymenus set out to come, eldest of all 
<A NAME="139"></A>the sons of godlike Neleus who were born at Pylos; Poseidon had given him 
<A NAME="140"></A>boundless strength and granted him that whatever shape he should crave 
<A NAME="141"></A>during the fight, that he should take in the stress of 
<A NAME="142"></A>battle.
<A NAME="143"></A><BR><BR>Moreover from Arcadia came Amphidamas and Cepheus, who inhabited 
<A NAME="144"></A>Tegea and the allotment of Apheidas, two sons of Aldus; and Ancaeus followed 
<A NAME="145"></A>them as the third, whom his father Lycurgus sent, the brother older than 
<A NAME="146"></A>both.  But he was left in the city to care for Aleus now growing old, while 
<A NAME="147"></A>he gave his son to join his brothers.  Antaeus went clad in the skin of 
<A NAME="148"></A>a Maenalian bear, and wielding in his right hand a huge two-edged battleaxe. 
<A NAME="149"></A> For his armour his grandsire had hidden in the house's innermost recess, 
<A NAME="150"></A>to see if he might by some means still stay his departure.
<A NAME="151"></A><BR><BR>There came also Augeias, whom fame declared to be the son of Helios; 
<A NAME="152"></A>he reigned over the Eleans, glorying in his wealth; and greatly he desired 
<A NAME="153"></A>to behold the Colchian land and Aeetes himself the ruler of the 
<A NAME="154"></A>Colchians.
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR>Asterius and Amphion, sons of Hyperasius, came from Achaean Pellene, 
<A NAME="156"></A>which once Pelles their grandsire founded on the brows of 
<A NAME="157"></A>Aegialus.
<A NAME="158"></A><BR><BR>After them from Taenarus came Euphemus whom, most swift-footed 
<A NAME="159"></A>of men, Europe, daughter of mighty Tityos, bare to Poseidon.  He was wont 
<A NAME="160"></A>to skim the swell of the grey sea, and wetted not his swift feet, but just 
<A NAME="161"></A>dipping the tips of his toes was borne on the watery 
<A NAME="162"></A>path.
<A NAME="163"></A><BR><BR>Yea, and two other sons of Poseidon came; one Erginus, who left 
<A NAME="164"></A>the citadel of glorious Miletus, the other proud Ancaeus, who left Parthenia, 
<A NAME="165"></A>the seat of Imbrasion Hera; both boasted their skill in seacraft and in 
<A NAME="166"></A>war.
<A NAME="167"></A><BR><BR>After them from Calydon came the son of Oeneus, strong Meleagrus, 
<A NAME="168"></A>and Laocoon--Laocoon the brother of Oeneus, though not by the same mother, 
<A NAME="169"></A>for a serving-woman bare him; him, now growing old, Oeneus sent to guard 
<A NAME="170"></A>his son: thus Meleagrus, still a youth, entered the bold band of heroes. 
<A NAME="171"></A> No other had come superior to him, I ween, except Heracles, if for one 
<A NAME="172"></A>year more he had tarried and been nurtured among the Aetolians.  Yea, and 
<A NAME="173"></A>his uncle, well skilled to fight whether with the javelin or hand to hand, 
<A NAME="174"></A>Iphiclus son of Thestius, bare him company on his way.
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR>With him came Palaemonius, son of Olenian Lernus, of Lernus by 
<A NAME="176"></A>repute, but his birth was from Hephaestus; and so he was crippled in his 
<A NAME="177"></A>feet, but his bodily frame and his valour no one would dare to scorn. 
<A NAME="178"></A> Wherefore he was numbered among all the chiefs, winning fame for 
<A NAME="179"></A>Jason.
<A NAME="180"></A><BR><BR>From the Phocians came Iphitus sprung from Naubolus son of Ornytus; 
<A NAME="181"></A>once he had been his host when Jason went to Pytho to ask for a response 
<A NAME="182"></A>concerning his voyage; for there he welcomed him in his own 
<A NAME="183"></A>hails.
<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR>Next came Zetes and Calais, sons of Boreas, whom once Oreithyia, 
<A NAME="185"></A>daughter of Erechtheus, bare to Boreas on the verge of wintry Thrace; thither 
<A NAME="186"></A>it was that Thracian Boreas snatched her away from Cecropia as she was 
<A NAME="187"></A>whirling in the dance, hard by Hissus' stream.  And, carrying her far off, 
<A NAME="188"></A>to the spot that men called the rock of Sarpedon, near the river Erginus, 
<A NAME="189"></A>he wrapped her in dark clouds and forced her to his will.  There they were 
<A NAME="190"></A>making their dusky wings quiver upon their ankles on both sides as they 
<A NAME="191"></A>rose, a great wonder to behold, wings that gleamed with golden scales: 
<A NAME="192"></A>and round their backs from the top of the head and neck, hither and thither, 
<A NAME="193"></A>their dark tresses were being shaken by the wind.
<A NAME="194"></A><BR><BR>No, nor had Acastus son of mighty Pelias himself any will to stay 
<A NAME="195"></A>behind in the palace of his brave sire, nor Argus, helper of the goddess 
<A NAME="196"></A>Athena; but they too were ready to be numbered in the 
<A NAME="197"></A>host.
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR>So many then were the helpers who assembled to join the son of 
<A NAME="199"></A>Aeson.  All the chiefs the dwellers thereabout called Minyae, for the most 
<A NAME="200"></A>and the bravest avowed that they were sprung from the blood of the daughters 
<A NAME="201"></A>of Minyas; thus Jason himself was the son of Alcimede who was born of Clymene 
<A NAME="202"></A>the daughter of Minyas.
<A NAME="203"></A><BR><BR>Now when all things had been made ready by the thralls, all things 
<A NAME="204"></A>that fully-equipped ships are furnished withal when men's business leads 
<A NAME="205"></A>them to voyage across the sea, then the heroes took their way through the 
<A NAME="206"></A>city to the ship where it lay on the strand that men call Magnesian Pagasae; 
<A NAME="207"></A>and a crowd of people hastening rushed together; but the heroes shone like 
<A NAME="208"></A>gleaming stars among the clouds; and each man as he saw them speeding along 
<A NAME="209"></A>with their armour would say:
<A NAME="210"></A><BR><BR>"King Zeus, what is the purpose of Pelias? Whither is he driving 
<A NAME="211"></A>forth from the Panachaean land so great a host of heroes?  On one day they 
<A NAME="212"></A>would waste the palace of Aeetes with baleful fire, should he not yield 
<A NAME="213"></A>them the fleece of his own goodwill.  But the path is not to be shunned, 
<A NAME="214"></A>the toil is hard for those who venture."
<A NAME="215"></A><BR><BR>Thus they spake here and there throughout the city; but the women 
<A NAME="216"></A>often raised their hands to the sky in prayer to the immortals to grant 
<A NAME="217"></A>a return, their hearts' desire.  And one with tears thus lamented to her 
<A NAME="218"></A>fellow:
<A NAME="219"></A><BR><BR>"Wretched Alcimede, evil has come to thee at last though late, 
<A NAME="220"></A>thou hast not ended with splendour of life.  Aeson too, ill-fated man! 
<A NAME="221"></A> Surely better had it been for him, if he were lying beneath the earth, 
<A NAME="222"></A>enveloped in his shroud, still unconscious of bitter toils.  Would that 
<A NAME="223"></A>the dark wave, when the maiden Helle perished, had overwhelmed Phrixus 
<A NAME="224"></A>too with the ram; but the dire portent even sent forth a human voice, that 
<A NAME="225"></A>it might cause to Alcimede sorrows and countless pains 
<A NAME="226"></A>hereafter."
<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR>Thus the women spake at the departure of the heroes.  And now many 
<A NAME="228"></A>thralls, men and women, were gathered together, and his mother, smitten 
<A NAME="229"></A>with grief for Jason.  And a bitter pang seized every woman's heart; and 
<A NAME="230"></A>with them groaned the father in baleful old age, lying on his bed, closely 
<A NAME="231"></A>wrapped round.  But the hero straightway soothed their pain, encouraging 
<A NAME="232"></A>them, and bade the thralls take up his weapons for war; and they in silence 
<A NAME="233"></A>with downcast looks took them up.  And even as the mother had thrown her 
<A NAME="234"></A>arms about her son, so she clung, weeping without stint, as a maiden all 
<A NAME="235"></A>alone weeps, falling fondly on the neck of her hoary nurse, a maid who 
<A NAME="236"></A>has now no others to care for her, but she drags on a weary life under 
<A NAME="237"></A>a stepmother, who maltreats her continually with ever fresh insults, and 
<A NAME="238"></A>as she weeps, her heart within her is bound fast with misery, nor can she 
<A NAME="239"></A>sob forth all the groans that struggle for utterance; so without stint 
<A NAME="240"></A>wept Alcimede straining her son in her arms, and in her yearning grief 
<A NAME="241"></A>spake as follows:
<A NAME="242"></A><BR><BR>"Would that on that day when, wretched woman that I am, I heard 
<A NAME="243"></A>King Pelias proclaim his evil behest, I had straightway given up my life 
<A NAME="244"></A>and forgotten my cares, so that thou thyself, my son, with thine own hands, 
<A NAME="245"></A>mightest have buried me; for that was the only wish left me still to be 
<A NAME="246"></A>fulfilled by time, all the other rewards for thy nurture have I long enjoyed. 
<A NAME="247"></A> Now I, once so admired among Achaean women, shall be left behind like 
<A NAME="248"></A>a bondwoman in my empty halls, pining away, ill-fated one, for love of 
<A NAME="249"></A>thee, thee on whose account I had aforetime so much splendour and renown, 
<A NAME="250"></A>my only son for whom I loosed my virgin zone first and last.  For to me 
<A NAME="251"></A>beyond others the goddess Eileithyia grudged abundant offspring.  Alas 
<A NAME="252"></A>for my folly!  Not once, not even in nay dreams did I forebode this, that 
<A NAME="253"></A>the flight of Phrixus would bring me woe."
<A NAME="254"></A><BR><BR>Thus with moaning she wept, and her handmaidens, standing by, lamented; 
<A NAME="255"></A>but Jason spake gently to her with comforting words:
<A NAME="256"></A><BR><BR>"Do not, I pray thee, mother, store up bitter sorrows overmuch, 
<A NAME="257"></A>for thou wilt not redeem me from evil by tears, but wilt still add grief 
<A NAME="258"></A>to grief.  For unseen are the woes that the gods mete out to mortals; be 
<A NAME="259"></A>strong to endure thy share of them though with grief in thy heart; take 
<A NAME="260"></A>courage from the promises of Athena, and from the answers of the gods (for 
<A NAME="261"></A>very favourable oracles has Phoebus given), and then from the help of the 
<A NAME="262"></A>chieftains.  But do thou remain here, quiet among thy handmaids, and be 
<A NAME="263"></A>not a bird of ill omen to the ship; and thither my clansmen and thralls 
<A NAME="264"></A>will follow me."
<A NAME="265"></A><BR><BR>He spake, and started forth to leave the house. And as Apollo goes 
<A NAME="266"></A>forth from some fragrant shrine to divine Delos or Claros or Pytho or to 
<A NAME="267"></A>broad Lyeia near the stream of Xanthus, in such beauty moved Jason through 
<A NAME="268"></A>the throng of people; and a cry arose as they shouted together.  And there 
<A NAME="269"></A>met him aged Iphias, priestess of Artemis guardian of the city, and kissed 
<A NAME="270"></A>his right hand, but she had not strength to say a word, for all her eagerness, 
<A NAME="271"></A>as the crowd rushed on, but she was left there by the wayside, as the old 
<A NAME="272"></A>are left by the young, and he passed on and was gone 
<A NAME="273"></A>afar.
<A NAME="274"></A><BR><BR>Now when he had left the well-built streets of the city, he came 
<A NAME="275"></A>to the beach of Pagasae, where his comrades greeted him as they stayed 
<A NAME="276"></A>together near the ship Argo.  And he stood at the entering in, and they 
<A NAME="277"></A>were gathered to meet him.  And they perceived Aeastus and Argus coming 
<A NAME="278"></A>from the city, and they marvelled when they saw them hasting with all speed, 
<A NAME="279"></A>despite the will of Pelias.  The one, Argus, son of Arestor, had cast round 
<A NAME="280"></A>his shoulders the hide of a bull reaching to his feet, with the black hair 
<A NAME="281"></A>upon it, the other, a fair mantle of double fold, which his sister Pelopeia 
<A NAME="282"></A>had given him.  Still Jason forebore from asking them about each point 
<A NAME="283"></A>but bade all be seated for an assembly.  And there, upon the folded sails 
<A NAME="284"></A>and the mast as it lay on the ground, they all took their seats in order. 
<A NAME="285"></A> And among them with goodwill spake Aeson's son:
<A NAME="286"></A><BR><BR>"All the equipment that a ship needs for all is in due order--lies 
<A NAME="287"></A>ready for our departure.  Therefore we will make no long delay in our sailing 
<A NAME="288"></A>for these things' sake, when the breezes but blow fair.  But, friends,--for 
<A NAME="289"></A>common to all is our return to Hellas hereafter, and common to all is our 
<A NAME="290"></A>path to the land of Aeetes--now therefore with ungrudging heart choose 
<A NAME="291"></A>the bravest to be our leader, who shall be careful for everything, to take 
<A NAME="292"></A>upon him our quarrels and covenants with strangers."
<A NAME="293"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spake; and the young heroes turned their eyes towards bold 
<A NAME="294"></A>Heracles sitting in their midst, and with one shout they all enjoined upon 
<A NAME="295"></A>him to be their leader; but he, from the place where he sat, stretched 
<A NAME="296"></A>forth his right hand and said:
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR>"Let no one offer this honour to me.  For I will not consent, and 
<A NAME="298"></A>I will forbid any other to stand up.  Let the hero who brought us together, 
<A NAME="299"></A>himself be the leader of the host."
<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spake with high thoughts, and they assented, as Heracles 
<A NAME="301"></A>bade; and warlike Jason himself rose up, glad at heart, and thus addressed 
<A NAME="302"></A>the eager throng:
<A NAME="303"></A><BR><BR>"If ye entrust your glory to my care, no longer as before let our 
<A NAME="304"></A>path be hindered.  Now at last let us propitiate Phoebus with sacrifice 
<A NAME="305"></A>and straightway prepare a feast.  And until my thralls come, the overseers 
<A NAME="306"></A>of my steading, whose care it is to choose out oxen from the herd and drive 
<A NAME="307"></A>them hither, we will drag down the ship to the sea, and do ye place all 
<A NAME="308"></A>the tackling within, and draw lots for the benches for rowing. Meantime 
<A NAME="309"></A>let us build upon the beach an altar to Apollo Embasius who by an oracle 
<A NAME="310"></A>promised to point out and show me the paths of the sea, if by sacrifice 
<A NAME="311"></A>to him I should begin my venture for King Pelias."
<A NAME="312"></A><BR><BR>He spake, and was the first to turn to the work, and they stood 
<A NAME="313"></A>up in obedience to him; and they heaped their garments, one upon the other, 
<A NAME="314"></A>on a smooth stone, which the sea did not strike with its waves, but the 
<A NAME="315"></A>stormy surge had cleansed it long before.  First of all, by the command 
<A NAME="316"></A>of Argus, they strongly girded the ship with a rope well twisted within, 
<A NAME="317"></A>stretching it tight on each side, in order that the planks might be well 
<A NAME="318"></A>compacted by the bolts and might withstand the opposing force of the surge. 
<A NAME="319"></A> And they quickly dug a trench as wide as the space the ship covered, and 
<A NAME="320"></A>at the prow as far into the sea as it would run when drawn down by their 
<A NAME="321"></A>hands.  And they ever dug deeper in front of the stem, and in the furrow 
<A NAME="322"></A>laid polished rollers; and inclined the ship down upon the first rollers, 
<A NAME="323"></A>that so she might glide and be borne on by them.  And above, on both sides, 
<A NAME="324"></A>reversing the oars, they fastened them round the thole- pins, so as to 
<A NAME="325"></A>project a cubit's space.  And the heroes themselves stood on both sides 
<A NAME="326"></A>at the oars in a row, and pushed forward with chest and hand at once. 
<A NAME="327"></A> And then Tiphys leapt on board to urge the youths to push at the right 
<A NAME="328"></A>moment; and calling on them he shouted loudly; and they at once, leaning 
<A NAME="329"></A>with all their strength, with one push started the ship from her place, 
<A NAME="330"></A>and strained with their feet, forcing her onward; and Pelian Argo followed 
<A NAME="331"></A>swiftly; and they on each side shouted as they rushed on.  And then the 
<A NAME="332"></A>rollers groaned under the sturdy keel as they were chafed, and round them 
<A NAME="333"></A>rose up a dark smoke owing to the weight, and she glided into the sea; 
<A NAME="334"></A>but the heroes stood there and kept dragging her back as she sped onward. 
<A NAME="335"></A> And round the thole-pins they fitted the oars, and in the ship they placed 
<A NAME="336"></A>the mast and the well-made sails and the stores.
<A NAME="337"></A><BR><BR>Now when they had carefully paid heed to everything, first they 
<A NAME="338"></A>distributed the benches by lot, two men occupying one seat; but the middle 
<A NAME="339"></A>bench they chose for Heracles and Ancaeus apart from the other heroes, 
<A NAME="340"></A>Ancaeus who dwelt in Tegea.  For them alone they left the middle bench 
<A NAME="341"></A>just as it was and not by lot; and with one consent they entrusted Tiphys 
<A NAME="342"></A>with guarding the helm of the well-stemmed ship.
<A NAME="343"></A><BR><BR>Next, piling up shingle near the sea, they raised there an altar 
<A NAME="344"></A>on the shore to Apollo, under the name of Actius and Embasius, and quickly 
<A NAME="345"></A>spread above it logs of dried olive-wood.  Meantime the herdsmen of Aeson's 
<A NAME="346"></A>son had driven before them from the herd two steers.  These the younger 
<A NAME="347"></A>comrades dragged near the altars, and the others brought lustral water 
<A NAME="348"></A>and barley meal, and Jason prayed, calling on Apollo the god of his 
<A NAME="349"></A>fathers:
<A NAME="350"></A><BR><BR>"Hear, O King, that dwellest in Pagasae and the city Aesonis, the 
<A NAME="351"></A>city called by my father's name, thou who didst promise me, when I sought 
<A NAME="352"></A>thy oracle at Pytho, to show the fulfilment and goal of my journey, for 
<A NAME="353"></A>thou thyself hast been the cause of my venture; now do thou thyself guide 
<A NAME="354"></A>the ship with my comrades safe and sound, thither and back again to Hellas. 
<A NAME="355"></A> Then in thy honour hereafter we will lay again on thy altar the bright 
<A NAME="356"></A>offerings of bulls--all of us who return; and other gifts in countless 
<A NAME="357"></A>numbers I will bring to Pytho and Ortygia.  And now, come, Far-darter, 
<A NAME="358"></A>accept this sacrifice at our hands, which first of all we have offered 
<A NAME="359"></A>thee for this ship on our embarcation; and grant, O King, that with a prosperous 
<A NAME="360"></A>weird I may loose the hawsers, relying on thy counsel, and may the breeze 
<A NAME="361"></A>blow softly with which we shall sail over the sea in fair 
<A NAME="362"></A>weather."
<A NAME="363"></A><BR><BR>He spake, and with his prayer cast the barley meal.  And they two 
<A NAME="364"></A>girded themselves to slay the steers, proud Ancaeus and Heracles.  The 
<A NAME="365"></A>latter with his club smote one steer mid-head on the brow, and falling 
<A NAME="366"></A>in a heap on the spot, it sank to the ground; and Ancaeus struck the broad 
<A NAME="367"></A>neck of the other with his axe of bronze, and shore through the mighty 
<A NAME="368"></A>sinews; and it fell prone on both its horns.  Their comrades quickly severed 
<A NAME="369"></A>the victims' throats, and flayed the hides: they sundered the joints and 
<A NAME="370"></A>carved the flesh, then cut out the sacred thigh bones, and covering them 
<A NAME="371"></A>all together closely with fat burnt them upon cloven wood.  And Aeson's 
<A NAME="372"></A>son poured out pure libations, and Idmon rejoiced beholding the flame as 
<A NAME="373"></A>it gleamed on every side from the sacrifice, and the smoke of it mounting 
<A NAME="374"></A>up with good omen in dark spiral columns; and quickly he spake outright 
<A NAME="375"></A>the will of Leto's son:
<A NAME="376"></A><BR><BR>"For you it is the will of heaven and destiny that ye shall return 
<A NAME="377"></A>here with the fleece; but meanwhile both going and returning, countless 
<A NAME="378"></A>trials await you.  But it is my lot, by the hateful decree of a god, to 
<A NAME="379"></A>die somewhere afar off on the mainland of Asia.  Thus, though I learnt 
<A NAME="380"></A>my fate from evil omens even before now, I have left my fatherland to embark 
<A NAME="381"></A>on the ship, that so after my embarking fair fame may be left me in my 
<A NAME="382"></A>house."
<A NAME="383"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spake; and the youths hearing the divine utterance rejoiced 
<A NAME="384"></A>at their return, but grief seized them for the fate of Idmon.  Now at the 
<A NAME="385"></A>hour when the sun passes his noon-tide halt and the ploughlands are just 
<A NAME="386"></A>being shadowed by the rocks, as the sun slopes towards the evening dusk, 
<A NAME="387"></A>at that hour all the heroes spread leaves thickly upon the sand and lay 
<A NAME="388"></A>down in rows in front of the hoary surf-line; and near them were spread 
<A NAME="389"></A>vast stores of viands and sweet wine, which the cupbearers had drawn off 
<A NAME="390"></A>in pitchers; afterwards they told tales one to another in turn, such as 
<A NAME="391"></A>youths often tell when at the feast and the bowl they take delightful pastime, 
<A NAME="392"></A>and insatiable insolence is far away.  But here the son of Aeson, all helpless, 
<A NAME="393"></A>was brooding over each event in his mind, like one oppressed with thought. 
<A NAME="394"></A> And Idas noted him and assailed him with loud voice:
<A NAME="395"></A><BR><BR>"Son of Aeson, what is this plan thou art turning over in mind. 
<A NAME="396"></A> Speak out thy thought in the midst.  Does fear come on and master thee, 
<A NAME="397"></A>fear, that confounds cowards?  Be witness now my impetuous spear, wherewith 
<A NAME="398"></A>in wars I win renown beyond all others (nor does Zeus aid me so much as 
<A NAME="399"></A>my own spear), that no woe will be fatal, no venture will be unachieved, 
<A NAME="400"></A>while Idas follows, even though a god should oppose thee.  Such a helpmeet 
<A NAME="401"></A>am I that thou bringest from Arene."
<A NAME="402"></A><BR><BR>He spake, and holding a brimming goblet in both hands drank off 
<A NAME="403"></A>the unmixed sweet wine; and his lips and dark cheeks were drenched with 
<A NAME="404"></A>it; and all the heroes clamoured together and Idmon spoke out 
<A NAME="405"></A>openly:
<A NAME="406"></A><BR><BR>"Vain wretch, thou art devising destruction for thyself before 
<A NAME="407"></A>the time.  Does the pure wine cause thy bold heart to swell in thy breast 
<A NAME="408"></A>to thy ruin, and has it set thee on to dishonour the gods?  Other words 
<A NAME="409"></A>of comfort there are with which a man might encourage his comrade; but 
<A NAME="410"></A>thou hast spoken with utter recklessness.  Such taunts, the tale goes, 
<A NAME="411"></A>did the sons of Aloeus once blurt out against the blessed gods, and thou 
<A NAME="412"></A>dost no wise equal them in valour; nevertheless they were both slain by 
<A NAME="413"></A>the swift arrows of Leto's son, mighty though they were."
<A NAME="414"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spake, and Aphareian Iclas laughed out, loud and long, 
<A NAME="415"></A>and eyeing him askance replied with biting words:
<A NAME="416"></A><BR><BR>"Come now, tell me this by thy prophetic art, whether for me too 
<A NAME="417"></A>the gods will bring to pass such doom as thy father promised for the sons 
<A NAME="418"></A>of Aloeus.  And bethink thee how thou wilt escape from my hands alive, 
<A NAME="419"></A>if thou art caught making a prophecy vain as the idle 
<A NAME="420"></A>wind."
<A NAME="421"></A><BR><BR>Thus in wrath Idas reviled him, and the strife would have gone 
<A NAME="422"></A>further had not their comrades and Aeson's son himself with indignant cry 
<A NAME="423"></A>restrained the contending chiefs; and Orpheus lifted his lyre in his left 
<A NAME="424"></A>hand and made essay to sing.
<A NAME="425"></A><BR><BR>He sang how the earth, the heaven and the sea, once mingled together 
<A NAME="426"></A>in one form, after deadly strife were separated each from other; and how 
<A NAME="427"></A>the stars and the moon and the paths of the sun ever keep their fixed place 
<A NAME="428"></A>in the sky; and how the mountains rose, and how the resounding rivers with 
<A NAME="429"></A>their nymphs came into being and all creeping things.  And he sang how 
<A NAME="430"></A>first of all Ophion and Eurynome, daughter of Ocean, held the sway of snowy 
<A NAME="431"></A>Olympus, and how through strength of arm one yielded his prerogative to 
<A NAME="432"></A>Cronos and the other to Rhea, and how they fell into the waves of Ocean; 
<A NAME="433"></A>but the other two meanwhile ruled over the blessed Titan-gods, while Zeus, 
<A NAME="434"></A>still a child and with the thoughts of a child, dwelt in the Dictaean cave; 
<A NAME="435"></A>and the earthborn Cyclopes had not yet armed him with the bolt, with thunder 
<A NAME="436"></A>and lightning; for these things give renown to Zeus.
<A NAME="437"></A><BR><BR>He ended, and stayed his lyre and divine voice. But though he had 
<A NAME="438"></A>ceased they still bent forward with eagerness all hushed to quiet, with 
<A NAME="439"></A>ears intent on the enchanting strain; such a charm of song had he left 
<A NAME="440"></A>behind in their hearts.  Not long after they mixed libations in honour 
<A NAME="441"></A>of Zeus, with pious rites as is customary, and poured them upon the burning 
<A NAME="442"></A>tongues, and bethought them of sleep in the darkness.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR><BR>Now when gleaming dawn with bright eyes beheld the lofty peaks 
<A NAME="444"></A>of Pelion, and the calm headlands were being drenched as the sea was ruffled 
<A NAME="445"></A>by the winds, then Tiphys awoke from sleep; and at once he roused his comrades 
<A NAME="446"></A>to go on board and make ready the oars.  And a strange cry did the harbour 
<A NAME="447"></A>of Pagasae utter, yea and Pelian Argo herself, urging them to set forth. 
<A NAME="448"></A>For in her a beam divine had been laid which Athena had brought from an 
<A NAME="449"></A>oak of Dodona and fitted in the middle of the stem.  And the heroes went 
<A NAME="450"></A>to the benches one after the other, as they had previously assigned for 
<A NAME="451"></A>each to row in his place, and took their seats in due order near their 
<A NAME="452"></A>fighting gear.  In the middle sat Antaeus and mighty Heracles, and near 
<A NAME="453"></A>him he laid his club, and beneath his tread the ship's keel sank deep. 
<A NAME="454"></A> And now the hawsers were being slipped and they poured wine on the sea. 
<A NAME="455"></A> But Jason with tears held his eyes away from his fatherland.  And just 
<A NAME="456"></A>as youths set up a dance in honour of Phoebus either in Pytho or haply 
<A NAME="457"></A>in Ortygia, or by the waters of Ismenus, and to the sound of the lyre round 
<A NAME="458"></A>his altar all together in time beat the earth with swiftly-moving feet; 
<A NAME="459"></A>so they to the sound of Orpheus' lyre smote with their oars the rushing 
<A NAME="460"></A>sea-water, and the surge broke over the blades; and on this side and on 
<A NAME="461"></A>that the dark brine seethed with foam, boiling terribly through the might 
<A NAME="462"></A>of the sturdy heroes.  And their arms shone in the sun like flame as the 
<A NAME="463"></A>ship sped on; and ever their wake gleamed white far behind, like a path 
<A NAME="464"></A>seen over a green plain.  On that day all the gods looked down from heaven 
<A NAME="465"></A>upon the ship and the might of the heroes, half- divine, the bravest of 
<A NAME="466"></A>men then sailing the sea; and on the topmost heights the nymphs of Pelion 
<A NAME="467"></A>wondered as they beheld the work of Itonian Athena, and the heroes themselves 
<A NAME="468"></A>wielding the oars.  And there came down from the mountain-top to the sea 
<A NAME="469"></A>Chiron, son of Philyra, and where the white surf broke he dipped his feet, 
<A NAME="470"></A>and, often waving with his broad hand, cried out to them at their departure, 
<A NAME="471"></A>"Good speed and a sorrowless home- return!"  And with him his wife, bearing 
<A NAME="472"></A>Peleus' son Achilles on her arm, showed the child to his dear 
<A NAME="473"></A>father.
<A NAME="474"></A><BR><BR>Now when they had left the curving shore of the harbour through 
<A NAME="475"></A>the cunning and counsel of prudent Tiphys son of Hagnias, who skilfully 
<A NAME="476"></A>handled the well-polished helm that he might guide them steadfastly, then 
<A NAME="477"></A>at length they set up the tall mast in the mastbox, and secured it with 
<A NAME="478"></A>forestays, drawing them taut on each side, and from it they let down the 
<A NAME="479"></A>sail when they had hauled it to the top-mast.  And a breeze came down piping 
<A NAME="480"></A>shrilly; and upon the deck they fastened the ropes separately round the 
<A NAME="481"></A>well-polished pins, and ran quietly past the long Tisaean headland.  And 
<A NAME="482"></A>for them the son of Oeagrus touched his lyre and sang in rhythmical song 
<A NAME="483"></A>of Artemis, saviour of ships, child of a glorious sire, who hath in her 
<A NAME="484"></A>keeping those peaks by the sea, and the land of Iolcos; and the fishes 
<A NAME="485"></A>came darting through the deep sea, great mixed with small, and followed 
<A NAME="486"></A>gambolling along the watery paths.  And as when in the track of the shepherd, 
<A NAME="487"></A>their master, countless sheep follow to the fold that have fed to the full 
<A NAME="488"></A>of grass, and he goes before gaily piping a shepherd's strain on Iris shrill 
<A NAME="489"></A>reed; so these fishes followed; and a chasing breeze ever bore the ship 
<A NAME="490"></A>onward.
<A NAME="491"></A><BR><BR>And straightway the misty land of the Pelasgians, rich in cornfields, 
<A NAME="492"></A>sank out of sight, and ever speeding onward they passed the rugged sides 
<A NAME="493"></A>of Pelion; and the Sepian headland sank away, and Sciathus appeared in 
<A NAME="494"></A>the sea, and far off appeared Piresiae and the calm shore of Magnesia on 
<A NAME="495"></A>the mainland and the tomb of Dolops; here then in the evening, as the wind 
<A NAME="496"></A>blew against them, they put to land, and paying honour to him at nightfall 
<A NAME="497"></A>burnt sheep as victims, while the sea was tossed by the swell: and for 
<A NAME="498"></A>two days they lingered on the shore, but on the third day they put forth 
<A NAME="499"></A>the ship, spreading on high the broad sail.  And even now men call that 
<A NAME="500"></A>beach Aphetae  of Argo.
<A NAME="501"></A><BR><BR>Thence going forward they ran past Meliboea, escaping a stormy 
<A NAME="502"></A>beach and surf-line.  And in the morning they saw Homole close at hand 
<A NAME="503"></A>leaning on the sea, and skirted it, and not long after they were about 
<A NAME="504"></A>to pass by the outfall of the river Amyrus.  From there they beheld Eurymenae 
<A NAME="505"></A>and the seawashed ravines of Ossa and Olympus; next they reached the slopes 
<A NAME="506"></A>of Pallene, beyond the headland of Canastra, running all night with the 
<A NAME="507"></A>wind.  And at dawn before them as they journeyed rose Athos, the Thracian 
<A NAME="508"></A>mountain, which with its topmost peak overshadows Lemnos, even as far as 
<A NAME="509"></A>Myrine, though it lies as far off as the space that a well-trimmed merchantship 
<A NAME="510"></A>would traverse up to mid-day.  For them on that day, till darkness fell, 
<A NAME="511"></A>the breeze blew exceedingly fresh, and the sails of the ship strained to 
<A NAME="512"></A>it. But with the setting of the sun the wind left them, and it was by the 
<A NAME="513"></A>oars that they reached Lemnos, the Sintian isle.
<A NAME="514"></A><BR><BR>Here the whole of the men of the people together had been ruthlessly 
<A NAME="515"></A>slain through the transgressions of the women in the year gone by.  For 
<A NAME="516"></A>the men had rejected their lawful wives, loathing them, and had conceived 
<A NAME="517"></A>a fierce passion for captive maids whom they themselves brought across 
<A NAME="518"></A>the sea from their forays in Thrace; for the terrible wrath of Cypris came 
<A NAME="519"></A>upon them, because for a long time they had grudged her the honours due. 
<A NAME="520"></A> O hapless women, and insatiate in jealousy to their own ruin!  Not their 
<A NAME="521"></A>husbands alone with the captives did they slay on account of the marriage-bed, 
<A NAME="522"></A>but all the males at the same time, that they might thereafter pay no retribution 
<A NAME="523"></A>for the grim murder.  And of all the women, Hypsipyle alone spared her 
<A NAME="524"></A>aged father Thoas, who was king over the people; and she sent him in a 
<A NAME="525"></A>hollow chest, to drift over the sea, if haply he should escape.  And fishermen 
<A NAME="526"></A>dragged him to shore at the island of Oenoe, formerly Oenoe, but afterwards 
<A NAME="527"></A>called Sicinus from Sicinus, whom the water-nymph Oenoe bore to Thoas. 
<A NAME="528"></A> Now for all the women to tend kine, to don armour of bronze, and to cleave 
<A NAME="529"></A>with the plough-share the wheat-bearing fields, was easier than the works 
<A NAME="530"></A>of Athena, with which they were busied aforetime.  Yet for all that did 
<A NAME="531"></A>they often gaze over the broad sea, in grievous fear against the Thracians' 
<A NAME="532"></A>coming.  So when they saw Argo being rowed near the island, straightway 
<A NAME="533"></A>crowding in multitude from the gates of Myrine and clad in their harness 
<A NAME="534"></A>of war, they poured forth to the beach like ravening Thyiades: for they 
<A NAME="535"></A>deemed that the Thracians were come; and with them Hypsipyle, daughter 
<A NAME="536"></A>of Thoas, donned her father's harness.  And they streamed down speechless 
<A NAME="537"></A>with dismay; such fear was wafted about them.
<A NAME="538"></A><BR><BR>Meantime from the ship the chiefs had sent Aethalides the swift 
<A NAME="539"></A>herald, to whose care they entrusted their messages and the wand of Hermes, 
<A NAME="540"></A>his sire, who had granted him a memory of all things, that never grew dim; 
<A NAME="541"></A>and not even now, though he has entered the unspeakable whirlpools of Acheron, 
<A NAME="542"></A>has forgetfulness swept over his soul, but its fixed doom is to be ever 
<A NAME="543"></A>changing its abode; at one time to be numbered among the dwellers beneath 
<A NAME="544"></A>the earth, at another to be in the light of the sun among living men. 
<A NAME="545"></A> But why need I tell at length tales of Aethalides?  He at that time persuaded 
<A NAME="546"></A>Hypsipyle to receive the new-comers as the day was waning into darkness; 
<A NAME="547"></A>nor yet at dawn did they loose the ship's hawsers to the breath of the 
<A NAME="548"></A>north wind.
<A NAME="549"></A><BR><BR>Now the Lemnian women fared through the city and sat down to the 
<A NAME="550"></A>assembly, for Hypsipyle herself had so bidden. And when they were all gathered 
<A NAME="551"></A>together in one great throng straightway she spake among them with stirring 
<A NAME="552"></A>words:
<A NAME="553"></A><BR><BR>"O friends, come let us grant these men gifts to their hearts' 
<A NAME="554"></A>desire, such as it is fitting that they should take on ship-board, food 
<A NAME="555"></A>and sweet wine, in order that they may steadfastly remain outside our towers, 
<A NAME="556"></A>and may not, passing among us for need's sake, get to know us all too well, 
<A NAME="557"></A>and so an evil report be widely spread; for we have wrought a terrible 
<A NAME="558"></A>deed and in nowise will it be to their liking, should they learn it.  Such 
<A NAME="559"></A>is our counsel now, but if any of you can devise a better plan let her 
<A NAME="560"></A>rise, for it was on this account that I summoned you 
<A NAME="561"></A>hither."
<A NAME="562"></A><BR><BR>Thus she spake and sat upon her father's seat of stone, and then 
<A NAME="563"></A>rose up her dear nurse Polyxo, for very age halting upon her withered feet, 
<A NAME="564"></A>bowed over a staff, and she was eager to address them.  Near her were seated 
<A NAME="565"></A>four virgins, unwedded, crowned with white hair.  And she stood in the 
<A NAME="566"></A>midst of the assembly and from her bent back she feebly raised her neck 
<A NAME="567"></A>and spake thus:
<A NAME="568"></A><BR><BR>"Gifts, as Hypsipyle herself wishes, let us send to the strangers, 
<A NAME="569"></A>for it is better to give them.  But for you what device have ye to get 
<A NAME="570"></A>profit of your life if the Thracian host fall upon us, or some other foe, 
<A NAME="571"></A>as often happens among men, even as now this company is come unforeseen? 
<A NAME="572"></A> But if one of the blessed gods should turn this aside yet countless other 
<A NAME="573"></A>woes, worse than battle, remain behind, when the aged women die off and 
<A NAME="574"></A>ye younger ones, without children, reach hateful old age.  How then will 
<A NAME="575"></A>ye live, hapless ones?  Will your oxen of their own accord yoke themselves 
<A NAME="576"></A>for the deep plough-lands and draw the earth-cleaving share through the 
<A NAME="577"></A>fallow, and forthwith, as the year comes round, reap the harvest?  Assuredly, 
<A NAME="578"></A>though the fates till now have shunned me in horror, I deem that in the 
<A NAME="579"></A>coming year I shall put on the garment of earth, when I have received my 
<A NAME="580"></A>meed of burial even so as is right, before the evil days draw near.  But 
<A NAME="581"></A>I bid you who are younger give good heed to this.  For now at your feet 
<A NAME="582"></A>a way of escape lies open, if ye trust to the strangers the care of your 
<A NAME="583"></A>homes and all your stock and your glorious city."
<A NAME="584"></A><BR><BR>Thus she spake, and the assembly was filled with clamour.  For 
<A NAME="585"></A>the word pleased them.  And after her straightway Hypsipyle rose up again, 
<A NAME="586"></A>and thus spake in reply.
<A NAME="587"></A><BR><BR>"If this purpose please you all, now will I even send a messenger 
<A NAME="588"></A>to the ship."
<A NAME="589"></A><BR><BR>She spake and addressed Iphinoe close at hand: "Go, Iphinoe, and 
<A NAME="590"></A>beg yonder man, whoever it is that leads this array, to come to our land 
<A NAME="591"></A>that I may tell him a word that pleases the heart of my people, and bid 
<A NAME="592"></A>the men themselves, if they wish, boldly enter the land and the city with 
<A NAME="593"></A>friendly intent."
<A NAME="594"></A><BR><BR>She spake, and dismissed the assembly, and thereafter started to 
<A NAME="595"></A>return home.  And so Iphinoe came to the Minyae; and they asked with what 
<A NAME="596"></A>intent she had come among them. And quickly she addressed her questioners 
<A NAME="597"></A>with all speed in these words:
<A NAME="598"></A><BR><BR>"The maiden Hypsipyle daughter of Thoas, sent me on my way here 
<A NAME="599"></A>to you, to summon the captain of your ship, whoever he be, that she may 
<A NAME="600"></A>tell him a word that pleases the heart of the people, and she bids yourselves, 
<A NAME="601"></A>if ye wish it, straightway enter the land and the city with friendly 
<A NAME="602"></A>intent."
<A NAME="603"></A><BR><BR>Thus she spake and the speech of good omen pleased all.  And they 
<A NAME="604"></A>deemed that Thoas was dead and that his beloved daughter Hypsipyle was 
<A NAME="605"></A>queen, and quickly they sent Jason on his way and themselves made ready 
<A NAME="606"></A>to go.
<A NAME="607"></A><BR><BR>Now he had buckled round his shoulders a purple mantle of double 
<A NAME="608"></A>fold, the work of the Tritonian goddess, which Pallas had given him when 
<A NAME="609"></A>she first laid the keel-props of the ship Argo and taught him how to measure 
<A NAME="610"></A>timbers with the rule. More easily wouldst thou cast thy eyes upon the 
<A NAME="611"></A>sun at its rising than behold that blazing splendour.  For indeed in the 
<A NAME="612"></A>middle the fashion thereof was red, but at the ends it was all purple, 
<A NAME="613"></A>and on each margin many separate devices had been skilfully 
<A NAME="614"></A>inwoven.
<A NAME="615"></A><BR><BR>In it were the Cyclops seated at their imperishable work, forging 
<A NAME="616"></A>a thunderbolt for King Zeus; by now it was almost finished in its brightness 
<A NAME="617"></A>and still it wanted but one ray, which they were beating out with their 
<A NAME="618"></A>iron hammers as it spurted forth a breath of raging 
<A NAME="619"></A>flame.
<A NAME="620"></A><BR><BR>In it too were the twin sons of Antiope, daughter of Asopus, Amphion 
<A NAME="621"></A>and Zethus, and Thebe still ungirt with towers was lying near, whose foundations 
<A NAME="622"></A>they were just then laying in eager haste.  Zethus on his shoulders was 
<A NAME="623"></A>lifting the peak of a steep mountain, like a man toiling hard, and Amphion 
<A NAME="624"></A>after him, singing loud and clear on his golden lyre, moved on, and a rock 
<A NAME="625"></A>twice as large followed his footsteps.
<A NAME="626"></A><BR><BR>Next in order had been wrought Cytherea with drooping tresses, 
<A NAME="627"></A>wielding the swift shield of Ares; and from her shoulder to her left arm 
<A NAME="628"></A>the fastening of her tunic was loosed beneath her breast; and opposite 
<A NAME="629"></A>in the shield of bronze her image appeared clear to view as she 
<A NAME="630"></A>stood.
<A NAME="631"></A><BR><BR>And in it there was a well-wooded pasturage of oxen; and about 
<A NAME="632"></A>the oxen the Teleboae and the sons of Eleetryon were fighting; the one 
<A NAME="633"></A>party defending themselves, the others, the Taphian raiders, longing to 
<A NAME="634"></A>rob them; and the dewy meadow was drenched with their blood, and the many 
<A NAME="635"></A>were overmastering the few herdsmen.
<A NAME="636"></A><BR><BR>And therein were fashioned two chariots, racing, and the one in 
<A NAME="637"></A>front Pelops was guiding, as he shook the reins, and with him was Hippodameia 
<A NAME="638"></A>at his side, and in pursuit Myrtilus urged his steeds, and with him Oenomaus 
<A NAME="639"></A>had grasped his couched spear, but fell as the axle swerved and broke in 
<A NAME="640"></A>the nave, while he was eager to pierce the back of Pelops.
<A NAME="641"></A><BR><BR>And in it was wrought Phoebus Apollo, a stripling not yet grown 
<A NAME="642"></A>up, in the act of shooting at mighty Tityos who was boldly dragging his 
<A NAME="643"></A>mother by her veil, Tityos whom glorious Elate bare, but Earth nursed him 
<A NAME="644"></A>and gave him second birth.
<A NAME="645"></A><BR><BR>And in it was Phrixus the Minyan as though he were in very deed 
<A NAME="646"></A>listening to the ram, while it was like one speaking.  Beholding them thou 
<A NAME="647"></A>wouldst be silent and wouldst cheat thy soul with the hope of hearing some 
<A NAME="648"></A>wise speech from them, and long wouldst thou gaze with that 
<A NAME="649"></A>hope.
<A NAME="650"></A><BR><BR>Such then were the gifts of the Tritonian goddess Athena.  And 
<A NAME="651"></A>in his right hand Jason held a fardarting spear, which Atalanta gave him 
<A NAME="652"></A>once as a gift of hospitality in Maenalus as she met him gladly; for she 
<A NAME="653"></A>eagerly desired to follow on that quest; but he himself of his own accord 
<A NAME="654"></A>prevented the maid, for he feared bitter strife on account of her 
<A NAME="655"></A>love.
<A NAME="656"></A><BR><BR>And he went on his way to the city like to a bright star, which 
<A NAME="657"></A>maidens, pent up in new-built chambers, behold as it rises above their 
<A NAME="658"></A>homes, and through the dark air it charms their eyes with its fair red 
<A NAME="659"></A>gleam and the maid rejoices, love-sick for the youth who is far away amid 
<A NAME="660"></A>strangers, for whom her parents are keeping her to be his bride; like to 
<A NAME="661"></A>that star the hero trod the way to the city.  And when they had passed 
<A NAME="662"></A>within the gates and the city, the women of the people surged behind them, 
<A NAME="663"></A>delighting in the stranger, but he with his eyes fixed on the ground fared 
<A NAME="664"></A>straight on, till he reached the glorious palace of Hypsipyle; and when 
<A NAME="665"></A>he appeared the maids opened the folding doors, fitted with well-fashioned 
<A NAME="666"></A>panels. Here Iphinoe leading him quickly through a fair porch set him upon 
<A NAME="667"></A>a shining seat opposite her mistress, but Hypsipyle turned her eyes aside 
<A NAME="668"></A>and a blush covered her maiden cheeks, yet for all her modesty she addressed 
<A NAME="669"></A>him with crafty words:
<A NAME="670"></A><BR><BR>"Stranger, why stay ye so long outside our towers? for the city 
<A NAME="671"></A>is not inhabited by the men, but they, as sojourners, plough the wheat-bearing 
<A NAME="672"></A>fields of the Thracian mainland.  And I will tell out truly all our evil 
<A NAME="673"></A>plight, that ye yourselves too may know it well.  When my father Thoas 
<A NAME="674"></A>reigned over the citizens, then our folk starting from their homes used 
<A NAME="675"></A>to plunder from their ships the dwellings of the Thracians who live opposite, 
<A NAME="676"></A>and they brought back hither measureless booty and maidens too.  But the 
<A NAME="677"></A>counsel of the baneful goddess Cypris was working out its accomplishment, 
<A NAME="678"></A>who brought upon them soul destroying infatuation.  For they hated their 
<A NAME="679"></A>lawful wives, and, yielding to their own mad folly, drove them from their 
<A NAME="680"></A>homes; and they took to their beds the captives of their spear, cruel ones. 
<A NAME="681"></A>Long in truth we endured it, if haply again, though late, they might change 
<A NAME="682"></A>their purpose, but ever the bitter woe grew, twofold.  And the lawful children 
<A NAME="683"></A>were being dishonoured in their halls, and a bastard race was rising. 
<A NAME="684"></A> And thus unmarried maidens and widowed mothers too wandered uncared for 
<A NAME="685"></A>through the city; no father heeded his daughter ever so little even though 
<A NAME="686"></A>he should see her done to death before his eyes at the hands of an insolent 
<A NAME="687"></A>step-dame, nor did sons, as before, defend their mother against unseemly 
<A NAME="688"></A>outrage; nor did brothers care at heart for their sister.  But in their 
<A NAME="689"></A>homes, in the dance, in the assembly and the banquet all their thought 
<A NAME="690"></A>was only for their captive maidens; until some god put desperate courage 
<A NAME="691"></A>in our hearts no more to receive our lords on their return from Thrace 
<A NAME="692"></A>within our towers so that they might either heed the right or might depart 
<A NAME="693"></A>and begone elsewhither, they and their captives.  So they begged of us 
<A NAME="694"></A>all the male children that were left in the city and went back to where 
<A NAME="695"></A>even now they dwell on the snowy tilths of Thrace.  Do ye therefore stay 
<A NAME="696"></A>and settle with us; and shouldst thou desire to dwell here, and this finds 
<A NAME="697"></A>favour with thee, assuredly thou shalt have the prerogative of my father 
<A NAME="698"></A>Thoas; and I deem that thou wilt not scorn our land at all; for it is deepsoiled 
<A NAME="699"></A>beyond all other islands that lie in the Aegaean sea.  But come now, return 
<A NAME="700"></A>to the ship and relate my words to thy comrades, and stay not outside our 
<A NAME="701"></A>city."
<A NAME="702"></A><BR><BR>She spoke, glozing over the murder that had been wrought upon the 
<A NAME="703"></A>men; and Jason addressed her in answer:
<A NAME="704"></A><BR><BR>"Hypsipyle, very dear to our hearts is the help we shall meet with, 
<A NAME="705"></A>which thou grantest to us who need thee.  And I will return again to the 
<A NAME="706"></A>city when I have told everything in order due.  But let the sovereignty 
<A NAME="707"></A>of the island be thine; it is not in scorn I yield it up, but grievous 
<A NAME="708"></A>trials urge me on."
<A NAME="709"></A><BR><BR>He spake, and touched her right hand; and quickly he turned to 
<A NAME="710"></A>go back: and round him the young maids on every side danced in countless 
<A NAME="711"></A>numbers in their joy till he passed through the gates.  And then they came 
<A NAME="712"></A>to the shore in smooth-running wains, bearing with them many gifts, when 
<A NAME="713"></A>now he had related from beginning to end the speech which Hypsipyle had 
<A NAME="714"></A>spoken when she summoned them; and the maids readily led the men back to 
<A NAME="715"></A>their homes for entertainment.  For Cypris stirred in them a sweet desire, 
<A NAME="716"></A>for the sake of Hephaestus of many counsels, in order that Lemnos might 
<A NAME="717"></A>be again inhabited by men and not be ruined.
<A NAME="718"></A><BR><BR>Thereupon Aeson's son started to go to the royal home of Hypsipyle; 
<A NAME="719"></A>and the rest went each his way as chance took them, all but Heracles; for 
<A NAME="720"></A>he of his own will was left behind by the ship and a few chosen comrades 
<A NAME="721"></A>with him.  And straightway the city rejoiced with dances and banquets, 
<A NAME="722"></A>being filled with the steam of sacrifice; and above all the immortals they 
<A NAME="723"></A>propitiated with songs and sacrifices the illustrious son of Hera and Cypris 
<A NAME="724"></A>herself.  And the sailing was ever delayed from one day to another; and 
<A NAME="725"></A>long would they have lingered there, had not Heracles, gathering together 
<A NAME="726"></A>his comrades apart from the women, thus addressed them with reproachful 
<A NAME="727"></A>words:
<A NAME="728"></A><BR><BR>"Wretched men, does the murder of kindred keep us from our native 
<A NAME="729"></A>land?  Or is it in want of marriage that we have come hither from thence, 
<A NAME="730"></A>in scorn of our countrywomen?  Does it please us to dwell here and plough 
<A NAME="731"></A>the rich soil of Lemnos?  No fair renown shall we win by thus tarrying 
<A NAME="732"></A>so long with stranger women; nor will some god seize and give us at our 
<A NAME="733"></A>prayer a fleece that moves of itself.  Let us then return each to his own; 
<A NAME="734"></A>but him leave ye to rest all day long in the embrace of Hypsipyle until 
<A NAME="735"></A>he has peopled Lemnos with men-children, and so there come to him great 
<A NAME="736"></A>glory."
<A NAME="737"></A><BR><BR>Thus did he chide the band; but no one dared to meet his eye or 
<A NAME="738"></A>to utter a word in answer.  But just as they were in the assembly they 
<A NAME="739"></A>made ready their departure in all haste, and the women came running towards 
<A NAME="740"></A>them, when they knew their intent. And as when bees hum round fair lilies 
<A NAME="741"></A>pouring forth from their hive in the rock, and all around the dewy meadow 
<A NAME="742"></A>rejoices, and they gather the sweet fruit, flitting from one to another; 
<A NAME="743"></A>even so the women eagerly poured forth clustering round the men with loud 
<A NAME="744"></A>lament, and greeted each one with hands and voice, praying the blessed 
<A NAME="745"></A>gods to grant him a safe return.  And so Hypsipyle too prayed, seizing 
<A NAME="746"></A>the hands of Aeson's son, and her tears flowed for the loss of her 
<A NAME="747"></A>lover:
<A NAME="748"></A><BR><BR>"Go, and may heaven bring thee back again with thy comrades unharmed, 
<A NAME="749"></A>bearing to the king the golden fleece, even as thou wilt and thy heart 
<A NAME="750"></A>desireth; and this island and my father's sceptre will be awaiting thee, 
<A NAME="751"></A>if on thy return hereafter thou shouldst choose to come hither again; and 
<A NAME="752"></A>easily couldst thou gather a countless host of men from other cities. But 
<A NAME="753"></A>thou wilt not have this desire, nor do I myself forbode that so it will 
<A NAME="754"></A>be. Still remember Hypsipyle when thou art far away and when thou hast 
<A NAME="755"></A>returned; and leave me some word of bidding, which I will gladly accomplish, 
<A NAME="756"></A>if haply heaven shall grant me to be a mother."
<A NAME="757"></A><BR><BR>And Aeson's son in admiration thus replied: "Hypsipyle, so may 
<A NAME="758"></A>all these things prove propitious by the favour of the blessed gods.  But 
<A NAME="759"></A>do thou hold a nobler thought of me, since by the grace of Pelias it is 
<A NAME="760"></A>enough for me to dwell in my native land; may the gods only release me 
<A NAME="761"></A>from my toils.  But if it is not my destiny to sail afar and return to 
<A NAME="762"></A>the land of Hellas, and if thou shouldst bear a male child, send him when 
<A NAME="763"></A>grown up to Pelasgian Iolcus, to heal the grief of my father and mother 
<A NAME="764"></A>if so be that he find them still living, in order that, far away from the 
<A NAME="765"></A>king, they may be cared for by their own hearth in their 
<A NAME="766"></A>home."
<A NAME="767"></A><BR><BR>He spake, and mounted the ship first of all; and so the rest of 
<A NAME="768"></A>the chiefs followed, and, sitting in order, seized the oars; and Argus 
<A NAME="769"></A>loosed for them the hawsers from under the sea-beaten rock.  Whereupon 
<A NAME="770"></A>they mightily smote the water with their long oars, and in the evening 
<A NAME="771"></A>by the injunctions of Orpheus they touched at the island of Electra,  daughter 
<A NAME="772"></A>of Atlas, in order that by gentle initiation they might learn the rites 
<A NAME="773"></A>that may not be uttered, and so with greater safety sail over the chilling 
<A NAME="774"></A>sea.  Of these I will make no further mention; but I bid farewell to the 
<A NAME="775"></A>island itself and the indwelling deities, to whom belong those mysteries, 
<A NAME="776"></A>which it is not lawful for me to sing.
<A NAME="777"></A><BR><BR>Thence did they row with eagerness over the depths of the black 
<A NAME="778"></A>Sea, having on the one side the land of the Thracians, on the other Imbros 
<A NAME="779"></A>on the south; and as the sun was just setting they reached the foreland 
<A NAME="780"></A>of the Chersonesus.  There a strong south wind blew for them; and raising 
<A NAME="781"></A>the sails to the breeze they entered the swift stream of the maiden daughter 
<A NAME="782"></A>of Athamas; and at dawn the sea to the north was left behind and at night 
<A NAME="783"></A>they were coasting inside the Rhoeteian shore, with the land of Ida on 
<A NAME="784"></A>their right.  And leaving Dardania they directed their course to Abydus, 
<A NAME="785"></A>and after it they sailed past Percote and the sandy beach of Abarnis and 
<A NAME="786"></A>divine Pityeia.  And in that night, as the ship sped on by sail and oar, 
<A NAME="787"></A>they passed right through the Hellespont dark-gleaming with 
<A NAME="788"></A>eddies.
<A NAME="789"></A><BR><BR>There is a lofty island inside the Propontis, a short distance 
<A NAME="790"></A>from the Phrygian mainland with its rich cornfields, sloping to the sea, 
<A NAME="791"></A>where an isthmus in front of the mainland is flooded by the waves, so low 
<A NAME="792"></A>does it lie.  And the isthmus has double shores, and they lie beyond the 
<A NAME="793"></A>river Aesepus, and the inhabitants round about call the island the Mount 
<A NAME="794"></A>of Bears.  And insolent and fierce men dwell there, Earthborn, a great 
<A NAME="795"></A>marvel to the neighbours to behold; for each one has six mighty hands to 
<A NAME="796"></A>lift up, two from his sturdy shoulders, and four below, fitting close to 
<A NAME="797"></A>his terrible sides.  And about the isthmus and the plain the Doliones had 
<A NAME="798"></A>their dwelling, and over them Cyzicus son of Aeneus was king, whom Aenete 
<A NAME="799"></A>the daughter of goodly Eusorus bare.  But these men the Earthborn monsters, 
<A NAME="800"></A>fearful though they were, in nowise harried, owing to the protection of 
<A NAME="801"></A>Poseidon; for from him had the Doliones first sprung.  Thither Argo pressed 
<A NAME="802"></A>on, driven by the winds of Thrace, and the Fair haven received her as she 
<A NAME="803"></A>sped.  There they cast away their small anchorstone by the advice of Tiphys 
<A NAME="804"></A>and left it beneath a fountain, the fountain of Artaeie; and they took 
<A NAME="805"></A>another meet for their purpose, a heavy one; but the first, according to 
<A NAME="806"></A>the oracle of the Far-Darter, the Ionians, sons of Neleus, in after days 
<A NAME="807"></A>laid to be a sacred stone, as was right, in the temple of Jasonian 
<A NAME="808"></A>Athena.
<A NAME="809"></A><BR><BR>Now the Doliones and Cyzicus himself all came together to meet 
<A NAME="810"></A>them with friendliness, and when they knew of the quest and their lineage 
<A NAME="811"></A>welcomed them with hospitality, and persuaded them to row further and to 
<A NAME="812"></A>fasten their ship's hawsers at the city harbour.  Here they built an altar 
<A NAME="813"></A>to Ecbasian Apollo and set it up on the beach, and gave heed to sacrifices. 
<A NAME="814"></A> And the king of his own bounty gave them sweet wine and sheep in their 
<A NAME="815"></A>need; for he had heard a report that whenever a godlike band of heroes 
<A NAME="816"></A>should come, straightway he should meet it with gentle words and should 
<A NAME="817"></A>have no thought of war.  As with Jason, the soft down was just blooming 
<A NAME="818"></A>on his chin, nor yet had it been his lot to rejoice in children, but still 
<A NAME="819"></A>in his palace his wife was untouched by the pangs of child-birth, the daughter 
<A NAME="820"></A>of Percosian Merops, fair-haired Cleite, whom lately by priceless gifts 
<A NAME="821"></A>he had brought from her father's home from the mainland opposite.  But 
<A NAME="822"></A>even so he left his chamber and bridal bed and prepared a banquet among 
<A NAME="823"></A>the strangers, casting all fears from his heart.  And they questioned one 
<A NAME="824"></A>another in turn.  Of them would he learn the end of their voyage and the 
<A NAME="825"></A>injunctions of Pelias; while they enquired about the cities of the people 
<A NAME="826"></A>round and all the gulf of the wide Propontis; but further he could not 
<A NAME="827"></A>tell them for all their desire to learn.  In the morning they climbed mighty 
<A NAME="828"></A>Dindymum that they might themselves behold the various paths of that sea; 
<A NAME="829"></A>and they brought their ship from its former anchorage to the harbour, Chytus; 
<A NAME="830"></A>and the path they trod is named the path of Jason.
<A NAME="831"></A><BR><BR>But the Earthborn men on the other side rushed down from the mountain 
<A NAME="832"></A>and with crags below blocked up the mouth of vast Chytus towards the sea, 
<A NAME="833"></A>like men lying in wait for a wild beast within.  But there Heracles had 
<A NAME="834"></A>been left behind with the younger heroes and he quickly bent his back-springing 
<A NAME="835"></A>bow against the monsters and brought them to earth one after another; and 
<A NAME="836"></A>they in their turn raised huge ragged rocks and hurled them.  For these 
<A NAME="837"></A>dread monsters too, I ween, the goddess Hera, bride of Zeus, had nurtured 
<A NAME="838"></A>to be a trial for Heracles.  And therewithal came the rest of the martial 
<A NAME="839"></A>heroes returning to meet the foe before they reached the height of outlook, 
<A NAME="840"></A>and they fell to the slaughter of the Earthborn, receiving them with arrows 
<A NAME="841"></A>and spears until they slew them all as they rushed fiercely to battle. 
<A NAME="842"></A> And as when woodcutters cast in rows upon the beach long trees just hewn 
<A NAME="843"></A>down by their axes, in order that, once sodden with brine, they may receive 
<A NAME="844"></A>the strong bolts; so these monsters at the entrance of the foam-fringed 
<A NAME="845"></A>harbour lay stretched one after another, some in heaps bending their heads 
<A NAME="846"></A>and breasts into the salt waves with their limbs spread out above on the 
<A NAME="847"></A>land; others again were resting their heads on the sand of the shore and 
<A NAME="848"></A>their feet in the deep water, both alike a prey to birds and fishes at 
<A NAME="849"></A>once.
<A NAME="850"></A><BR><BR>But the heroes, when the contest was ended without fear, loosed 
<A NAME="851"></A>the ship's hawsers to the breath of the wind and pressed on through the 
<A NAME="852"></A>sea-swell.  And the ship sped on under sail all day; but when night came 
<A NAME="853"></A>the rushing wind did not hold steadfast, but contrary blasts caught them 
<A NAME="854"></A>and held them back till they again approached the hospitable Doliones. 
<A NAME="855"></A> And they stepped ashore that same night; and the rock is still called 
<A NAME="856"></A>the Sacred Rock round which they threw the ship's hawsers in their haste. 
<A NAME="857"></A> Nor did anyone note with care that it was the same island; nor in the 
<A NAME="858"></A>night did the Doliones clearly perceive that the heroes were returning; 
<A NAME="859"></A>but they deemed that Pelasgian war-men of the Macrians had landed.  Therefore 
<A NAME="860"></A>they donned their armour and raised their hands against them.  And with 
<A NAME="861"></A>clashing of ashen spears and shields they fell on each other, like the 
<A NAME="862"></A>swift rush of fire which falls on dry brushwood and rears its crest; and 
<A NAME="863"></A>the din of battle, terrible and furious, fell upon the people of the Doliones. 
<A NAME="864"></A> Nor was the king to escape his fate and return home from battle to his 
<A NAME="865"></A>bridal chamber and bed.  But Aeson's son leapt upon him as he turned to 
<A NAME="866"></A>face him, and smote him in the middle of the breast, and the bone was shattered 
<A NAME="867"></A>round the spear; he rolled forward in the sand and filled up the measure 
<A NAME="868"></A>of his fate.  For that no mortal may escape; but on every side a wide snare 
<A NAME="869"></A>encompasses us.  And so, when he thought that he had escaped bitter death 
<A NAME="870"></A>from the chiefs, fate entangled him that very night in her toils while 
<A NAME="871"></A>battling with them; and many champions withal were slain; Heracles killed 
<A NAME="872"></A>Telecles and Megabrontes, and Acastus slew Sphodris; and Peleus slew Zelus 
<A NAME="873"></A>and Gephyrus swift in war. Telamon of the strong spear slew Basileus. 
<A NAME="874"></A> And Idas slew Promeus, and Clytius Hyacinthus, and the two sons of Tyndareus 
<A NAME="875"></A>slew Megalossaces and Phlogius.  And after them the son of Oeneus slew 
<A NAME="876"></A>bold Itomeneus, and Artaceus, leader of men; all of whom the inhabitants 
<A NAME="877"></A>still honour with the worship due to heroes.  And the rest gave way and 
<A NAME="878"></A>fled in terror just as doves fly in terror before swift-winged hawks. 
<A NAME="879"></A> And with a din they rustled in a body to the gates; and quickly the city 
<A NAME="880"></A>was filled with loud cries at the turning of the dolorous fight.  But at 
<A NAME="881"></A>dawn both sides perceived the fatal and cureless error; and bitter grief 
<A NAME="882"></A>seized the Minyan heroes when they saw before them Cyzicus son of Aeneus 
<A NAME="883"></A>fallen in the midst of dust and blood.  And for three whole days they lamented 
<A NAME="884"></A>and rent their hair, they and the Dollones.  Then three times round his 
<A NAME="885"></A>tomb they paced in armour of bronze and performed funeral rites and celebrated 
<A NAME="886"></A>games, as was meet, upon the meadow-plain, where even now rises the mound 
<A NAME="887"></A>of his grave to be seen by men of a later day.  No, nor was his bride Cleite 
<A NAME="888"></A>left behind her dead husband, but to crown the ill she wrought an ill yet 
<A NAME="889"></A>more awful, when she clasped a noose round her neck.  Her death even the 
<A NAME="890"></A>nymphs of the grove bewailed; and of all the tears for her that they shed 
<A NAME="891"></A>to earth from their eyes the goddesses made a fountain, which they call 
<A NAME="892"></A>Cleite,  the illustrious name of the hapless maid.  Most terrible came 
<A NAME="893"></A>that day from Zeus upon the Doliones, women and men; for no one of them 
<A NAME="894"></A>dared even to taste food, nor for a long time by reason of grief did they 
<A NAME="895"></A>take thought for the toil of the cornmill, but they dragged on their lives 
<A NAME="896"></A>eating their food as it was, untouched by fire.  Here even now, when the 
<A NAME="897"></A>Ionians that dwell in Cyzicus pour their yearly libations for the dead, 
<A NAME="898"></A>they ever grind the meal for the sacrificial cakes at the common 
<A NAME="899"></A>mill.
<A NAME="900"></A><BR><BR>After this, fierce tempests arose for twelve days and nights together 
<A NAME="901"></A>and kept them there from sailing.  But in the next night the rest of the 
<A NAME="902"></A>chieftains, overcome by sleep, were resting during the latest period of 
<A NAME="903"></A>the night, while Acastus and Mopsus the son of Ampyeus kept guard over 
<A NAME="904"></A>their deep slumbers.  And above the golden head of Aeson's son there hovered 
<A NAME="905"></A>a halcyon prophesying with shrill voice the ceasing of the stormy winds; 
<A NAME="906"></A>and Mopsus heard and understood the cry of the bird of the shore, fraught 
<A NAME="907"></A>with good omen.  And some god made it turn aside, and flying aloft it settled 
<A NAME="908"></A>upon the stern-ornament of the ship. And the seer touched Jason as he lay 
<A NAME="909"></A>wrapped in soft sheepskins and woke him at once, and thus 
<A NAME="910"></A>spake:
<A NAME="911"></A><BR><BR>"Son of Aeson, thou must climb to this temple on rugged Dindymum 
<A NAME="912"></A>and propitiate the mother  of all the blessed gods on her fair throne, 
<A NAME="913"></A>and the stormy blasts shall cease.  For such was the voice I heard but 
<A NAME="914"></A>now from the halcyon, bird of the sea, which, as it flew above thee in 
<A NAME="915"></A>thy slumber, told me all. For by her power the winds and the sea and all 
<A NAME="916"></A>the earth below and the snowy seat of Olympus are complete; and to her, 
<A NAME="917"></A>when from the mountains she ascends the mighty heaven, Zeus himself, the 
<A NAME="918"></A>son of Cronos, gives place.  In like manner the rest of the immortal blessed 
<A NAME="919"></A>ones reverence the dread goddess."
<A NAME="920"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spake, and his words were welcome to Jason's ear.  And 
<A NAME="921"></A>he arose from his bed with joy and woke all his comrades hurriedly and 
<A NAME="922"></A>told them the prophecy of Mopsus the son of Ampycus.  And quickly the younger 
<A NAME="923"></A>men drove oxen from their stalls and began to lead them to the mountain's 
<A NAME="924"></A>lofty summit. And they loosed the hawsers from the sacred rock and rowed 
<A NAME="925"></A>to the Thracian harbour; and the heroes climbed the mountain, leaving a 
<A NAME="926"></A>few of their comrades in the ship.  And to them the Macrian heights and 
<A NAME="927"></A>all the coast of Thrace opposite appeared to view close at hand.  And there 
<A NAME="928"></A>appeared the misty mouth of Bosporus and the Mysian hills; and on the other 
<A NAME="929"></A>side the stream of the river Aesepus and the city and Nepeian plain of 
<A NAME="930"></A>Adrasteia.  Now there was a sturdy stump of vine that grew in the forest, 
<A NAME="931"></A>a tree exceeding old; this they cut down, to be the sacred image of the 
<A NAME="932"></A>mountain goddess; and Argus smoothed it skilfully, and they set it upon 
<A NAME="933"></A>that rugged hill beneath a canopy of lofty oaks, which of all trees have 
<A NAME="934"></A>their roots deepest.  And near it they heaped an altar of small stones, 
<A NAME="935"></A>and wreathed their brows with oak leaves and paid heed to sacrifice, invoking 
<A NAME="936"></A>the mother of Dindymum, most venerable, dweller in Phrygia, and Titias 
<A NAME="937"></A>and Cyllenus, who alone of many are called dispensers of doom and assessors 
<A NAME="938"></A>of the Idaean mother,--the Idaean Dactyls of Crete, whom once the nymph 
<A NAME="939"></A>Anchiale, as she grasped with both hands the land of Oaxus, bare in the 
<A NAME="940"></A>Dictaean cave.  And with many prayers did Aeson's son beseech the goddess 
<A NAME="941"></A>to turn aside the stormy blasts as he poured libations on the blazing sacrifice; 
<A NAME="942"></A>and at the same time by command of Orpheus the youths trod a measure dancing 
<A NAME="943"></A>in full armour, and clashed with their swords on their shields, so that 
<A NAME="944"></A>the ill-omened cry might be lost in the air the wail which the people were 
<A NAME="945"></A>still sending up in grief for their king.  Hence from that time forward 
<A NAME="946"></A>the Phrygians propitiate Rhea with the wheel and the drum.  And the gracious 
<A NAME="947"></A>goddess, I ween, inclined her heart to pious sacrifices; and favourable 
<A NAME="948"></A>signs appeared.  The trees shed abundant fruit, and round their feet the 
<A NAME="949"></A>earth of its own accord put forth flowers from the tender grass.  And the 
<A NAME="950"></A>beasts of the wild wood left their lairs and thickets and came up fawning 
<A NAME="951"></A>on them with their tails.  And she caused yet another marvel; for hitherto 
<A NAME="952"></A>there was no flow of water on Dindymum, but then for them an unceasing 
<A NAME="953"></A>stream gushed forth from the thirsty peak just as it was, and the dwellers 
<A NAME="954"></A>around in after times called that stream, the spring of Jason.  And then 
<A NAME="955"></A>they made a feast in honour of the goddess on the Mount of Bears, singing 
<A NAME="956"></A>the praises of Rhea most venerable; but at dawn the winds had ceased and 
<A NAME="957"></A>they rowed away from the island.
<A NAME="958"></A><BR><BR>Thereupon a spirit of contention stirred each chieftain, who should 
<A NAME="959"></A>be the last to leave his oar.  For all around the windless air smoothed 
<A NAME="960"></A>the swirling waves and lulled the sea to rest.  And they, trusting in the 
<A NAME="961"></A>calm, mightily drove the ship forward; and as she sped through the salt 
<A NAME="962"></A>sea, not even the storm-footed steeds of Poseidon would have overtaken 
<A NAME="963"></A>her. Nevertheless when the sea was stirred by violent blasts which were 
<A NAME="964"></A>just rising from the rivers about evening, forspent with toil, they ceased. 
<A NAME="965"></A> But Heracles by the might of his arms pulled the weary rowers along all 
<A NAME="966"></A>together, and made the strong-knit timbers of the ship to quiver.  But 
<A NAME="967"></A>when, eager to reach the Mysian mainland, they passed along in sight of 
<A NAME="968"></A>the mouth of Rhyndaeus and the great cairn of Aegaeon, a little way from 
<A NAME="969"></A>Phrygia, then Heracles, as he ploughed up the furrows of the roughened 
<A NAME="970"></A>surge, broke his oar in the middle.  And one half he held in both his hands 
<A NAME="971"></A>as he fell sideways, the other the sea swept away with its receding wave. 
<A NAME="972"></A> And he sat up in silence glaring round; for his hands were unaccustomed 
<A NAME="973"></A>to he idle.
<A NAME="974"></A><BR><BR>Now at the hour when from the field some delver or ploughman goes 
<A NAME="975"></A>gladly home to his hut, longing for his evening meal, and there on the 
<A NAME="976"></A>threshold, all squalid with dust, bows his wearied knees, and, beholding 
<A NAME="977"></A>his hands worn with toil, with many a curse reviles his belly; at that 
<A NAME="978"></A>hour the heroes reached the homes of the Cianian land near the Arganthonian 
<A NAME="979"></A>mount and the outfall of Cius.  Them as they came in friendliness, the 
<A NAME="980"></A>Mysians, inhabitants of that land, hospitably welcomed, and gave them in 
<A NAME="981"></A>their need provisions and sheep and abundant wine.  Hereupon some brought 
<A NAME="982"></A>dried wood, others from the meadows leaves for beds which they gathered 
<A NAME="983"></A>in abundance for strewing, whilst others were twirling sticks to get fire; 
<A NAME="984"></A>others again were mixing wine in the bowl and making ready the feast, after 
<A NAME="985"></A>sacrificing at nightfall to Apollo Ecbasius.
<A NAME="986"></A><BR><BR>But the son of Zeus having duly enjoined on his comrades to prepare 
<A NAME="987"></A>the feast took his way into a wood, that he might first fashion for himself 
<A NAME="988"></A>an oar to fit his hand. Wandering about he found a pine not burdened with 
<A NAME="989"></A>many branches, nor too full of leaves, but like to the shaft of a tall 
<A NAME="990"></A>poplar; so great was it both in length and thickness to look at.  And quickly 
<A NAME="991"></A>he laid on the ground his arrow-holding quiver together with his bow, and 
<A NAME="992"></A>took off his lion's skin.  And he loosened the pine from the ground with 
<A NAME="993"></A>his bronze-tipped club and grasped the trunk with both hands at the bottom, 
<A NAME="994"></A>relying on his strength; and he pressed it against his broad shoulder with 
<A NAME="995"></A>legs wide apart; and clinging close he raised it from the ground deep-rooted 
<A NAME="996"></A>though it was, together with clods of earth.  And as when unexpectedly, 
<A NAME="997"></A>just at the time of the stormy setting of baleful Orion, a swift gust of 
<A NAME="998"></A>wind strikes down from above, and wrenches a ship's mast from its stays, 
<A NAME="999"></A>wedges and all; so did Heracles lift the pine.  And at the same time he 
<A NAME="1000"></A>took up his bow and arrows, his lion skin and club, and started on his 
<A NAME="1001"></A>return.
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR><BR>Meantime Hylas with pitcher of bronze in hand had gone apart from 
<A NAME="1003"></A>the throng, seeking the sacred flow of a fountain, that he might be quick 
<A NAME="1004"></A>in drawing water for the evening meal and actively make all things ready 
<A NAME="1005"></A>in due order against his lord's return.  For in such ways did Heracles 
<A NAME="1006"></A>nurture him from his first childhood when he had carried him off from the 
<A NAME="1007"></A>house of his father, goodly Theiodamas, whom the hero pitilessly slew among 
<A NAME="1008"></A>the Dryopians because he withstood him about an ox for the plough.  Theiodamas 
<A NAME="1009"></A>was cleaving with his plough the soil of fallow land when he was smitten 
<A NAME="1010"></A>with the curse; and Heracles bade him give up the ploughing ox against 
<A NAME="1011"></A>his will.  For he desired to find some pretext for war against the Dryopians 
<A NAME="1012"></A>for their bane, since they dwelt there reckless of right.  But these tales 
<A NAME="1013"></A>would lead me far astray from my song.  And quickly Hylas came to the spring 
<A NAME="1014"></A>which the people who dwell thereabouts call Pegae.  And the dances of the 
<A NAME="1015"></A>nymphs were just now being held there; for it was the care of all the nymphs 
<A NAME="1016"></A>that haunted that lovely headland ever to hymn Artemis in songs by night. 
<A NAME="1017"></A> All who held the mountain peaks or glens, all they were ranged far off 
<A NAME="1018"></A>guarding the woods; but one, a water-nymph was just rising from the fair-flowing 
<A NAME="1019"></A>spring; and the boy she perceived close at hand with the rosy flush of 
<A NAME="1020"></A>his beauty and sweet grace.  For the full moon beaming from the sky smote 
<A NAME="1021"></A>him.  And Cypris made her heart faint, and in her confusion she could scarcely 
<A NAME="1022"></A>gather her spirit back to her.  But as soon as he dipped the pitcher in 
<A NAME="1023"></A>the stream, leaning to one side, and the brimming water rang loud as it 
<A NAME="1024"></A>poured against the sounding bronze, straightway she laid her left arm above 
<A NAME="1025"></A>upon his neck yearning to kiss his tender mouth; and with her right hand 
<A NAME="1026"></A>she drew down his elbow, and plunged him into the midst of the 
<A NAME="1027"></A>eddy.
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR><BR>Alone of his comrades the hero Polyphemus, son of Eilatus, as he 
<A NAME="1029"></A>went forward on the path, heard the boy's cry, for he expected the return 
<A NAME="1030"></A>of mighty Heracles.  And he rushed after the cry, near Pegae, like some 
<A NAME="1031"></A>beast of the wild wood whom the bleating of sheep has reached from afar, 
<A NAME="1032"></A>and burning with hunger he follows, but does not fall in with the flocks; 
<A NAME="1033"></A>for the shepherds beforehand have penned them in the fold, but he groans 
<A NAME="1034"></A>and roars vehemently until he is weary.  Thus vehemently at that time did 
<A NAME="1035"></A>the son of Eilatus groan and wandered shouting round the spot; and his 
<A NAME="1036"></A>voice rang piteous.  Then quickly drawing his great sword he started in 
<A NAME="1037"></A>pursuit, in fear lest the boy should be the prey of wild beasts, or men 
<A NAME="1038"></A>should have lain in ambush for him faring all alone, and be carrying him 
<A NAME="1039"></A>off, an easy prey. Hereupon as he brandished his bare sword in his hand 
<A NAME="1040"></A>he met Heracles himself on the path, and well he knew him as he hastened 
<A NAME="1041"></A>to the ship through the darkness.  And straightway he told the wretched 
<A NAME="1042"></A>calamity while his heart laboured with his panting breath.
<A NAME="1043"></A><BR><BR>"My poor friend, I shall be the first to bring thee tidings of 
<A NAME="1044"></A>bitter woe.  Hylas has gone to the well and has not returned safe, but 
<A NAME="1045"></A>robbers have attacked and are carrying him off, or beasts are tearing him 
<A NAME="1046"></A>to pieces; I heard his cry."
<A NAME="1047"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spake; and when Heracles heard his words, sweat in abundance 
<A NAME="1048"></A>poured down from his temples and the black blood boiled beneath his heart. 
<A NAME="1049"></A> And in wrath he hurled the pine to the ground and hurried along the path 
<A NAME="1050"></A>whither his feet bore on his impetuous soul.  And as when a bull stung 
<A NAME="1051"></A>by a gadfly tears along, leaving the meadows and the marsh land, and recks 
<A NAME="1052"></A>not of herdsmen or herd, but presses on, now without cheek, now standing 
<A NAME="1053"></A>still, and raising his broad neck he bellows loudly, stung by the maddening 
<A NAME="1054"></A>fly; so he in his frenzy now would ply his swift knees unresting, now again 
<A NAME="1055"></A>would cease from toil and shout afar with loud pealing 
<A NAME="1056"></A>cry.
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR><BR>But straightway the morning star rose above the topmost peaks and 
<A NAME="1058"></A>the breeze swept down; and quickly did Tiphys urge them to go aboard and 
<A NAME="1059"></A>avail themselves of the wind.  And they embarked eagerly forthwith; and 
<A NAME="1060"></A>they drew up the ship's anchors and hauled the ropes astern.  And the sails 
<A NAME="1061"></A>were bellied out by the wind, and far from the coast were they joyfully 
<A NAME="1062"></A>borne past the Posideian headland.  But at the hour when gladsome dawn 
<A NAME="1063"></A>shines from heaven, rising from the east, and the paths stand out clearly, 
<A NAME="1064"></A>and the dewy plains shine with a bright gleam, then at length they were 
<A NAME="1065"></A>aware that unwittingly they had abandoned those men.  And a fierce quarrel 
<A NAME="1066"></A>fell upon them, and violent tumult, for that they had sailed and left behind 
<A NAME="1067"></A>the bravest of their comrades.  And Aeson's son, bewildered by their hapless 
<A NAME="1068"></A>plight, said never a word, good or bad; but sat with his heavy load of 
<A NAME="1069"></A>grief, eating out his heart.  And wrath seized Telamon, and thus he 
<A NAME="1070"></A>spake:
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR><BR>"Sit there at thy ease, for it was fitting for thee to leave Heracles 
<A NAME="1072"></A>behind; from thee the project arose, so that his glory throughout Hellas 
<A NAME="1073"></A>should not overshadow thee, if so be that heaven grants us a return home. 
<A NAME="1074"></A> But what pleasure is there in words?  For I will go, I only, with none 
<A NAME="1075"></A>of thy comrades, who have helped thee to plan this treachery."
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR><BR>He spake, and rushed upon Tiphys son of Hagnias; and his eyes sparkled 
<A NAME="1077"></A>like flashes of ravening flame.  And they would quickly have turned back 
<A NAME="1078"></A>to the land of the Mysians, forcing their way through the deep sea and 
<A NAME="1079"></A>the unceasing blasts of the wind, had not the two sons of Thracian Boreas 
<A NAME="1080"></A>held back the son of Aeacus with harsh words.  Hapless ones, assuredly 
<A NAME="1081"></A>a bitter vengeance came upon them thereafter at the hands of Heracles, 
<A NAME="1082"></A>because they stayed the search for him.  For when they were returning from 
<A NAME="1083"></A>the games over Pelias dead he slew them in sea-girt Tenos and heaped the 
<A NAME="1084"></A>earth round them, and placed two columns above, one of which, a great marvel 
<A NAME="1085"></A>for men to see, moves at the breath of the blustering north wind.  These 
<A NAME="1086"></A>things were thus to be accomplished in after times.  But to them appeared 
<A NAME="1087"></A>Glaucus from the depths of the sea, the wise interpreter of divine Nereus, 
<A NAME="1088"></A>and raising aloft his shaggy head and chest from his waist below, with 
<A NAME="1089"></A>sturdy hand he seized the ship's keel, and then cried to the eager 
<A NAME="1090"></A>crew:
<A NAME="1091"></A><BR><BR>"Why against the counsel of mighty Zeus do ye purpose to lead bold 
<A NAME="1092"></A>Heracles to the city of Aeetes?  At Argos it is his fate to labour for 
<A NAME="1093"></A>insolent Eurystheus and to accomplish full twelve toils and dwell with 
<A NAME="1094"></A>the immortals, if so be that he bring to fulfilment a few more yet; wherefore 
<A NAME="1095"></A>let there be no vain regret for him.  Likewise it is destined for Polyphemus 
<A NAME="1096"></A>to found a glorious city at the mouth of Cius among the Mysians and to 
<A NAME="1097"></A>fill up the measure of his fate in the vast land of the Chalybes.  But 
<A NAME="1098"></A>a goddess-nymph through love has made Hylas her husband, on whose account 
<A NAME="1099"></A>those two wandered and were left behind."
<A NAME="1100"></A><BR><BR>He spake, and with a plunge wrapped him about with the restless 
<A NAME="1101"></A>wave; and round him the dark water foamed in seething eddies and dashed 
<A NAME="1102"></A>against the hollow ship as it moved through the sea.  And the heroes rejoiced, 
<A NAME="1103"></A>and Telamon son of Aeacus came in haste to Jason, and grasping his hand 
<A NAME="1104"></A>in his own embraced him with these words:
<A NAME="1105"></A><BR><BR>"Son of Aeson, be not wroth with me, if in my folly I have erred, 
<A NAME="1106"></A>for grief wrought upon me to utter a word arrogant and intolerable.  But 
<A NAME="1107"></A>let me give my fault to the winds and let our hearts be joined as 
<A NAME="1108"></A>before."
<A NAME="1109"></A><BR><BR>Him the son of Aeson with prudence addressed: "Good friend, assuredly 
<A NAME="1110"></A>with an evil word didst thou revile me, saying before them all that I was 
<A NAME="1111"></A>the wronger of a kindly man. But not for long will I nurse bitter wrath, 
<A NAME="1112"></A>though indeed before I was grieved.  For it was not for flocks of sheep, 
<A NAME="1113"></A>no, nor for possessions that thou wast angered to fury, but for a man, 
<A NAME="1114"></A>thy comrade.  And I were fain thou wouldst even champion me against another 
<A NAME="1115"></A>man if a like thing should ever befall me."
<A NAME="1116"></A><BR><BR>He spake, and they sat down, united as of old. But of those two, 
<A NAME="1117"></A>by the counsel of Zeus, one, Polyphemus son of Eilatus, was destined to 
<A NAME="1118"></A>found and build a city among the Mysians bearing the river's name, and 
<A NAME="1119"></A>the other, Heracles, to return and toil at the labours of Eurystheus. 
<A NAME="1120"></A> And he threatened to lay waste the Mysian land at once, should they not 
<A NAME="1121"></A>discover for him the doom of Hylas, whether living or dead.  And for him
