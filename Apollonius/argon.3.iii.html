<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Come now, Erato, stand by my side, and say next how Jason brought back 
<A NAME="11"></A>the fleece to Iolcus aided by the love of Medea.  For thou sharest the 
<A NAME="12"></A>power of Cypris, and by thy love-cares dost charm unwedded maidens; wherefore 
<A NAME="13"></A>to thee too is attached a name that tells of love.
<A NAME="14"></A><BR><BR>Thus the heroes, unobserved, were waiting in ambush amid the thick 
<A NAME="15"></A>reed-beds; but Hera and Athena took note of them, and, apart from Zeus 
<A NAME="16"></A>and the other immortals, entered a chamber and took counsel together; and 
<A NAME="17"></A>Hera first made trial of Athena:
<A NAME="18"></A><BR><BR>"Do thou now first, daughter of Zeus, give advice. What must be 
<A NAME="19"></A>done?  Wilt thou devise some scheme whereby they may seize the golden fleece 
<A NAME="20"></A>of Aeetes and bear it to Hellas, or can they deceive the king with soft 
<A NAME="21"></A>words and so work persuasion?  Of a truth he is terribly overweening. 
<A NAME="22"></A> Still it is right to shrink from no endeavour."
<A NAME="23"></A><BR><BR>Thus she spake, and at once Athena addressed her: "I too was pondering 
<A NAME="24"></A>such thoughts in my heart, Hera, when thou didst ask me outright.  But 
<A NAME="25"></A>not yet do I think that I have conceived a scheme to aid the courage of 
<A NAME="26"></A>the heroes, though I have balanced many plans."
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR>She ended, and the goddesses fixed their eyes on the ground at 
<A NAME="28"></A>their feet, brooding apart; and straightway Hera was the first to speak 
<A NAME="29"></A>her thought: "Come, let us go to Cypris; let both of us accost her and 
<A NAME="30"></A>urge her to bid her son (if only he will obey) speed his shaft at the daughter 
<A NAME="31"></A>of Aeetes, the enchantress, and charm her with love for Jason.  And I deem 
<A NAME="32"></A>that by her device he will bring back the fleece to 
<A NAME="33"></A>Hellas."
<A NAME="34"></A><BR><BR>Thus she spake, and the prudent plan pleased Athena, and she addressed 
<A NAME="35"></A>her in reply with gentle words:
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR>"Hera, my father begat me to be a stranger to the darts of love, 
<A NAME="37"></A>nor do I know any charm to work desire.  But if the word pleases thee, 
<A NAME="38"></A>surely I will follow; but thou must speak when we meet 
<A NAME="39"></A>her."
<A NAME="40"></A><BR><BR>So she said, and starting forth they came to the mighty palace 
<A NAME="41"></A>of Cypris, which her husband, the halt-footed god, had built for her when 
<A NAME="42"></A>first he brought her from Zeus to be his wife.  And entering the court 
<A NAME="43"></A>they stood beneath the gallery of the chamber where the goddess prepared 
<A NAME="44"></A>the couch of Hephaestus. But he had gone early to his forge and anvils 
<A NAME="45"></A>to a broad cavern in a floating island where with the blast of flame he 
<A NAME="46"></A>wrought all manner of curious work; and she all alone was sitting within, 
<A NAME="47"></A>on an inlaid seat facing the door.  And her white shoulders on each side 
<A NAME="48"></A>were covered with the mantle of her hair and she was parting it with a 
<A NAME="49"></A>golden comb and about to braid up the long tresses; but when she saw the 
<A NAME="50"></A>goddesses before her, she stayed and called them within, and rose from 
<A NAME="51"></A>her seat and placed them on couches.  Then she herself sat down, and with 
<A NAME="52"></A>her hands gathered up the locks still uncombed.  And smiling she addressed 
<A NAME="53"></A>them with crafty words:
<A NAME="54"></A><BR><BR>"Good friends, what intent, what occasion brings you here after 
<A NAME="55"></A>so long?  Why have ye come, not too frequent visitors before, chief among 
<A NAME="56"></A>goddesses that ye are?"
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR>And to her Hera replied: "Thou dost mock us, but our hearts are 
<A NAME="58"></A>stirred with calamity.  For already on the river Phasis the son of Aeson 
<A NAME="59"></A>moors his ship, he and his comrades in quest of the fleece.  For all their 
<A NAME="60"></A>sakes we fear terribly (for the task is nigh at hand) but most for Aeson's 
<A NAME="61"></A>son.  Him will I deliver, though he sail even to Hades to free Ixion below 
<A NAME="62"></A>from his brazen chains, as far as strength lies in my limbs, so that Pelias 
<A NAME="63"></A>may not mock at having escaped an evil doom--Pelias who left me unhonoured 
<A NAME="64"></A>with sacrifice.  Moreover Jason was greatly loved by me before, ever since 
<A NAME="65"></A>at the mouth of Anaurus in flood, as I was making trial of men's righteousness, 
<A NAME="66"></A>he met me on his return from the chase; and all the mountains and long 
<A NAME="67"></A>ridged peaks were sprinkled with snow, and from them the torrents rolling 
<A NAME="68"></A>down were rushing with a roar.  And he took pity on me in the likeness 
<A NAME="69"></A>of an old crone, and raising me on his shoulders himself bore me through 
<A NAME="70"></A>the headlong tide.  So he is honoured by me unceasingly; nor will Pelias 
<A NAME="71"></A>pay the penalty of his outrage, unless thou wilt grant Jason his 
<A NAME="72"></A>return."
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>Thus she spake, and speechlessness seized Cypris. And beholding 
<A NAME="74"></A>Hera supplicating her she felt awe, and then addressed her with friendly 
<A NAME="75"></A>words: "Dread goddess, may no viler thing than Cypris ever be found, if 
<A NAME="76"></A>I disregard thy eager desire in word or deed, whatever my weak arms can 
<A NAME="77"></A>effect; and let there be no favour in return."
<A NAME="78"></A><BR><BR>She spake, and Hera again addressed her with prudence: "It is not 
<A NAME="79"></A>in need of might or of strength that we have come.  But just quietly bid 
<A NAME="80"></A>thy boy charm Aeetes' daughter with love for Jason.  For if she will aid 
<A NAME="81"></A>him with her kindly counsel, easily do I think he will win the fleece of 
<A NAME="82"></A>gold and return to Iolcus, for she is full of wiles."
<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR>Thus she spake, and Cypris addressed them both: "Hera and Athena, 
<A NAME="84"></A>he will obey you rather than me.  For unabashed though he is, there will 
<A NAME="85"></A>be some slight shame in his eyes before you; but he has no respect for 
<A NAME="86"></A>me, but ever slights me in contentious mood.  And, overborne by his naughtiness, 
<A NAME="87"></A>I purpose to break his ill-sounding arrows and his bow in his very sight. 
<A NAME="88"></A>For in his anger he has threatened that if I shall not keep my hands off 
<A NAME="89"></A>him while he still masters his temper, I shall have cause to blame myself 
<A NAME="90"></A>thereafter."
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR>So she spake, and the goddesses smiled and looked at each other. 
<A NAME="92"></A> But Cypris again spoke, vexed at heart: "To others my sorrows are a jest; 
<A NAME="93"></A>nor ought I to tell them to all; I know them too well myself.  But now, 
<A NAME="94"></A>since this pleases you both, I will make the attempt and coax him, and 
<A NAME="95"></A>he will not say me nay."
<A NAME="96"></A><BR><BR>Thus she spake, and Hera took her slender hand and gently smiling, 
<A NAME="97"></A>replied: "Perform this task, Cytherea, straightway, as thou sayest; and 
<A NAME="98"></A>be not angry or contend with thy boy; he will cease hereafter to vex 
<A NAME="99"></A>thee."
<A NAME="100"></A><BR><BR>She spake, and left her seat, and Athena accompanied her and they 
<A NAME="101"></A>went forth both hastening back.  And Cypris went on her way through the 
<A NAME="102"></A>glens of Olympus to find her boy.  And she found him apart, in the blooming 
<A NAME="103"></A>orchard of Zeus, not alone, but with him Ganymedes, whom once Zeus had 
<A NAME="104"></A>set to dwell among the immortal gods, being enamoured of his beauty. And 
<A NAME="105"></A>they were playing for golden dice, as boys in one house are wont to do. 
<A NAME="106"></A> And already greedy Eros was holding the palm of his left hand quite full 
<A NAME="107"></A>of them under his breast, standing upright; and on the bloom of his cheeks 
<A NAME="108"></A>a sweet blush was glowing.  But the other sat crouching hard by, silent 
<A NAME="109"></A>and downcast, and he had two dice left which he threw one after the other, 
<A NAME="110"></A>and was angered by the loud laughter of Eros.  And lo, losing them straightway 
<A NAME="111"></A>with the former, he went off empty handed, helpless, and noticed not the 
<A NAME="112"></A>approach of Cypris.  And she stood before her boy, and laying her hand 
<A NAME="113"></A>on his lips, addressed him:
<A NAME="114"></A><BR><BR>"Why dost thou smile in triumph, unutterable rogue?  Hast thou 
<A NAME="115"></A>cheated him thus, and unjustly overcome the innocent child?  Come, be ready 
<A NAME="116"></A>to perform for me the task I will tell thee of, and I will give thee Zeus' 
<A NAME="117"></A>all-beauteous plaything -- the one which his dear nurse Adrasteia made 
<A NAME="118"></A>for him, while he still lived a child, with childish ways, in the Idaean 
<A NAME="119"></A>cave--a well-rounded ball; no better toy wilt thou get from the hands of 
<A NAME="120"></A>Hephaestus.  All of gold are its zones, and round each double seams run 
<A NAME="121"></A>in a circle; but the stitches are hidden, and a dark blue spiral overlays 
<A NAME="122"></A>them all.  But if thou shouldst cast it with thy hands, lo, like a star, 
<A NAME="123"></A>it sends a flaming track through the sky.  This I will give thee; and do 
<A NAME="124"></A>thou strike with thy shaft and charm the daughter of Aeetes with love for 
<A NAME="125"></A>Jason; and let there be no loitering.  For then my thanks would be the 
<A NAME="126"></A>slighter."
<A NAME="127"></A><BR><BR>Thus she spake, and welcome were her words to the listening boy. 
<A NAME="128"></A> And he threw down all his toys, and eagerly seizing her robe on this side 
<A NAME="129"></A>and on that, clung to the goddess. And he implored her to bestow the gift 
<A NAME="130"></A>at once; but she, facing him with kindly words, touched his cheeks, kissed 
<A NAME="131"></A>him and drew him to her, and replied with a smile:
<A NAME="132"></A><BR><BR>"Be witness now thy dear head and mine, that surely I will give 
<A NAME="133"></A>thee the gift and deceive thee not, if thou wilt strike with thy shaft 
<A NAME="134"></A>Aeetes' daughter."
<A NAME="135"></A><BR><BR>She spoke, and he gathered up his dice, and having well counted 
<A NAME="136"></A>them all threw them into his mother's gleaming lap. And straightway with 
<A NAME="137"></A>golden baldric he slung round him his quiver from where it leant against 
<A NAME="138"></A>a tree-trunk, and took up his curved bow.  And he fared forth through the 
<A NAME="139"></A>fruitful orchard of the palace of Zeus.  Then he passed through the gates 
<A NAME="140"></A>of Olympus high in air; hence is a downward path from heaven; and the twin 
<A NAME="141"></A>poles rear aloft steep mountain tops the highest crests of earth, where 
<A NAME="142"></A>the risen sun grows ruddy with his first beams.  And beneath him there 
<A NAME="143"></A>appeared now the life-giving earth and cities of men and sacred streams 
<A NAME="144"></A>of rivers, and now in turn mountain peaks and the ocean all around, as 
<A NAME="145"></A>he swept through the vast expanse of air.
<A NAME="146"></A><BR><BR>Now the heroes apart in ambush, in a back-water of the river, were 
<A NAME="147"></A>met in council, sitting on the benches of their ship.  And Aeson's son 
<A NAME="148"></A>himself was speaking among them; and they were listening silently in their 
<A NAME="149"></A>places sitting row upon row: "My friends, what pleases myself that will 
<A NAME="150"></A>I say out; it is for you to bring about its fulfilment.  For in common 
<A NAME="151"></A>is our task, and common to all alike is the right of speech; and he who 
<A NAME="152"></A>in silence withholds his thought and his counsel, let him know that it 
<A NAME="153"></A>is he alone that bereaves this band of its home-return.  Do ye others rest 
<A NAME="154"></A>here in the ship quietly with your arms; but I will go to the palace of 
<A NAME="155"></A>Aeetes, taking with me the sons of Phrixus and two comrades as well.  And 
<A NAME="156"></A>when I meet him I will first make trial with words to see if he will be 
<A NAME="157"></A>willing to give up the golden fleece for friendship's sake or not, but 
<A NAME="158"></A>trusting to his might will set at nought our quest.  For so, learning his 
<A NAME="159"></A>frowardness first from himself, we will consider whether we shall meet 
<A NAME="160"></A>him in battle, or some other plan shall avail us, if we refrain from the 
<A NAME="161"></A>war-cry.  And let us not merely by force, before putting words to the test, 
<A NAME="162"></A>deprive him of his own possession.  But first it is better to go to him 
<A NAME="163"></A>and win his favour by speech.  Oftentimes, I ween, does speech accomplish 
<A NAME="164"></A>at need what prowess could hardly catty through, smoothing the path in 
<A NAME="165"></A>manner befitting.  And he once welcomed noble Phrixus, a fugitive from 
<A NAME="166"></A>his stepmother's wiles and the sacrifice prepared by his father.  For all 
<A NAME="167"></A>men everywhere, even the most shameless, reverence the ordinance of Zeus, 
<A NAME="168"></A>god of strangers, and regard it."
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spake, and the youths approved the words of Aeson's son 
<A NAME="170"></A>with one accord, nor was there one to counsel otherwise.  And then he summoned 
<A NAME="171"></A>to go with him the sons of Phrixus, and Telamon and Augeias; and himself 
<A NAME="172"></A>took Hermes' wand; and at once they passed forth from the ship beyond the 
<A NAME="173"></A>reeds and the water to dry land, towards the rising ground of the plain. 
<A NAME="174"></A>The plain, I wis, is called Circe's; and here in line grow many willows 
<A NAME="175"></A>and osiers, on whose topmost branches hang corpses bound with cords.  For 
<A NAME="176"></A>even now it is an abomination with the Colchians to burn dead men with 
<A NAME="177"></A>fire; nor is it lawful to place them in the earth and raise a mound above, 
<A NAME="178"></A>but to wrap them in untanned oxhides and suspend them from trees far from 
<A NAME="179"></A>the city.  And so earth has an equal portion with air, seeing that they 
<A NAME="180"></A>bury the women; for that is the custom of their land.
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR>And as they went Hera with friendly thought spread a thick mist 
<A NAME="182"></A>through the city, that they might fare to the palace of Aeetes unseen by 
<A NAME="183"></A>the countless hosts of the Colchians.  But soon when from the plain they 
<A NAME="184"></A>came to the city and Aeetes' palace, then again Hera dispersed the mist. 
<A NAME="185"></A> And they stood at the entrance, marvelling at the king's courts and the 
<A NAME="186"></A>wide gates and columns which rose in ordered lines round the walls; and 
<A NAME="187"></A>high up on the palace a coping of stone rested on brazen triglyphs. And 
<A NAME="188"></A>silently they crossed the threshold.  And close by garden vines covered 
<A NAME="189"></A>with green foliage were in full bloom, lifted high in air.  And beneath 
<A NAME="190"></A>them ran four fountains, ever-flowing, which Hephaestus had delved out. 
<A NAME="191"></A> One was gushing with milk, one with wine, while the third flowed with 
<A NAME="192"></A>fragrant oil; and the fourth ran with water, which grew warm at the setting 
<A NAME="193"></A>of the Pleiads, and in turn at their rising bubbled forth from the hollow 
<A NAME="194"></A>rock, cold as crystal.  Such then were the wondrous works that the craftsman-god 
<A NAME="195"></A>Hephaestus had fashioned in the palace of Cytaean Aeetes.  And he wrought 
<A NAME="196"></A>for him bulls with feet of bronze, and their mouths were of bronze, and 
<A NAME="197"></A>from them they breathed out a terrible flame of fire; moreover he forged 
<A NAME="198"></A>a plough of unbending adamant, all in one piece, in payment of thanks to 
<A NAME="199"></A>Helios, who had taken the god up in his chariot when faint from the Phlegraean 
<A NAME="200"></A>fight.   And here an inner-court was built, and round it were many well-fitted 
<A NAME="201"></A>doors and chambers here and there, and all along on each side was a richly-wrought 
<A NAME="202"></A>gallery.  And on both sides loftier buildings stood obliquely.  In one, 
<A NAME="203"></A>which was the loftiest, lordly Aeetes dwelt with his queen; and in another 
<A NAME="204"></A>dwelt Apsyrtus, son of Aeetes, whom a Caucasian nymph, Asterodeia, bare 
<A NAME="205"></A>before he made Eidyia his wedded wife, the youngest daughter of Tethys 
<A NAME="206"></A>and Oceanus.  And the sons of the Colchians called him by the new name 
<A NAME="207"></A>of Phaethon,  because he outshone all the youths.  The other buildings 
<A NAME="208"></A>the handmaidens had, and the two daughters of Aeetes, Chalciope and Medea. 
<A NAME="209"></A> Medea then [they found] going from chamber to chamber in search of her 
<A NAME="210"></A>sister, for Hera detained her within that day; but beforetime she was not 
<A NAME="211"></A>wont to haunt the palace, but all day long was busied in Hecate's temple, 
<A NAME="212"></A>since she herself was the priestess of the goddess.  And when she saw them 
<A NAME="213"></A>she cried aloud, and quickly Chalciope caught the sound; and her maids, 
<A NAME="214"></A>throwing down at their feet their yarn and their thread, rushed forth all 
<A NAME="215"></A>in a throng. And she, beholding her sons among them, raised her hands aloft 
<A NAME="216"></A>through joy; and so they likewise greeted their mother, and when they saw 
<A NAME="217"></A>her embraced her in their gladness; and she with many sobs spoke 
<A NAME="218"></A>thus:
<A NAME="219"></A><BR><BR>"After all then, ye were not destined to leave me in your heedlessness 
<A NAME="220"></A>and to wander far; but fate has turned you back.  Poor wretch that I am! 
<A NAME="221"></A> What a yearning for Hellas from some woeful madness seized you at the 
<A NAME="222"></A>behest of your father Phrixus.  Bitter sorrows for my heart did he ordain 
<A NAME="223"></A>when dying. And why should ye go to the city of Orchomenus, whoever this 
<A NAME="224"></A>Orchomenus is, for the sake of Athamas' wealth, leaving your mother alone 
<A NAME="225"></A>to bear her grief?"
<A NAME="226"></A><BR><BR>Such were her words; and Aeetes came forth last of all and Eidyia 
<A NAME="227"></A>herself came, the queen of Aeetes, on hearing the voice of Chalciope; and 
<A NAME="228"></A>straightway all the court was filled with a throng.  Some of the thralls 
<A NAME="229"></A>were busied with a mighty bull, others with the axe were cleaving dry billets, 
<A NAME="230"></A>and others heating with fire water for the baths; nor was there one who 
<A NAME="231"></A>relaxed his toil, serving the king.
<A NAME="232"></A><BR><BR>Meantime Eros passed unseen through the grey mist, causing confusion, 
<A NAME="233"></A>as when against grazing heifers rises the gadfly, which oxherds call the 
<A NAME="234"></A>breese.  And quickly beneath the lintel in the porch he strung his bow 
<A NAME="235"></A>and took from the quiver an arrow unshot before, messenger of pain.  And 
<A NAME="236"></A>with swift feet unmarked he passed the threshold and keenly glanced around; 
<A NAME="237"></A>and gliding close by Aeson's son he laid the arrow-notch on the cord in 
<A NAME="238"></A>the centre, and drawing wide apart with both hands he shot at Medea; and 
<A NAME="239"></A>speechless amazement seized her soul.  But the god himself flashed back 
<A NAME="240"></A>again from the high-roofed hall, laughing loud; and the bolt burnt deep 
<A NAME="241"></A>down in the maiden's heart like a flame; and ever she kept darting bright 
<A NAME="242"></A>glances straight up at Aeson's son, and within her breast her heart panted 
<A NAME="243"></A>fast through anguish, all remembrance left her, and her soul melted with 
<A NAME="244"></A>the sweet pain.  And as a poor woman heaps dry twigs round a blazing brand--a 
<A NAME="245"></A>daughter of toil, whose task is the spinning of wool, that she may kindle 
<A NAME="246"></A>a blaze at night beneath her roof, when she has waked very early--and the 
<A NAME="247"></A>flame waxing wondrous great from the small brand consumes all the twigs 
<A NAME="248"></A>together; so, coiling round her heart, burnt secretly Love the destroyer; 
<A NAME="249"></A>and the hue of her soft cheeks went and came, now pale, now red, in her 
<A NAME="250"></A>soul's distraction.
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR>Now when the thralls had laid a banquet ready before them, and 
<A NAME="252"></A>they had refreshed themselves with warm baths, gladly did they please their 
<A NAME="253"></A>souls with meat and drink.  And thereafter Aeetes questioned the sons of 
<A NAME="254"></A>his daughter, addressing them with these words:
<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR>"Sons of my daughter and of Phrixus, whom beyond all strangers 
<A NAME="256"></A>I honoured in my halls, how have ye come returning back to Aea?  Did some 
<A NAME="257"></A>calamity cut short your escape in the midst?  Ye did not listen when I 
<A NAME="258"></A>set before you the boundless length of the way.  For I marked it once, 
<A NAME="259"></A>whirled along in the chariot of my father Helios, when he was bringing 
<A NAME="260"></A>my sister Circe to the western land and we came to the shore of the Tyrrhenian 
<A NAME="261"></A>mainland, where even now she abides, exceeding far from Colchis. But what 
<A NAME="262"></A>pleasure is there in words?  Do ye tell me plainly what has been your fortune, 
<A NAME="263"></A>and who these men are, your companions, and where from your hollow ship 
<A NAME="264"></A>ye came ashore."
<A NAME="265"></A><BR><BR>Such were his questions, and Argus, before all his brethren, being 
<A NAME="266"></A>fearful for the mission of Aeson's son, gently replied, for he was the 
<A NAME="267"></A>elder-born:
<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR>"Aeetes, that ship forthwith stormy blasts tore asunder, and ourselves, 
<A NAME="269"></A>crouching on the beams, a wave drove on to the beach of the isle of Enyalius 
<A NAME="270"></A> in the murky night; and some god preserved us.  For even the birds of 
<A NAME="271"></A>Ares that haunted the desert isle beforetime, not even them did we find. 
<A NAME="272"></A> But these men had driven them off, having landed from their ship on the 
<A NAME="273"></A>day before; and the will of Zeus taking pity on us, or some fate, detained 
<A NAME="274"></A>them there, since they straightway gave us both food and clothing in abundance, 
<A NAME="275"></A>when they heard the illustrious name of Phrixus and thine own; for to thy 
<A NAME="276"></A>city are they faring.  And if thou dost wish to know their errand, I will 
<A NAME="277"></A>not hide it from time.  A certain king, vehemently longing to drive this 
<A NAME="278"></A>man far from his fatherland and possessions, because in might he outshone 
<A NAME="279"></A>all the sons of Aeolus, sends him to voyage hither on a bootless venture; 
<A NAME="280"></A>and asserts that the stock of Aeolus will not escape the heart-grieving 
<A NAME="281"></A>wrath and rage of implacable Zeus, nor the unbearable curse and vengeance 
<A NAME="282"></A>due for Phrixus, until the fleece comes back to Hellas.  And their ship 
<A NAME="283"></A>was fashioned by Pallas Athena, not such a one as are the ships among the 
<A NAME="284"></A>Colchians, on the vilest of which we chanced.  For the fierce waves and 
<A NAME="285"></A>wind broke her utterly to pieces; but the other holds firm with her bolts, 
<A NAME="286"></A>even though all the blasts should buffet her.  And with equal swiftness 
<A NAME="287"></A>she speedeth before the wind and when the crew ply the oar with unresting 
<A NAME="288"></A>hands.  And he hath gathered in her the mightiest heroes of all Achaea, 
<A NAME="289"></A>and hath come to thy city from wandering far through cities and gulfs of 
<A NAME="290"></A>the dread ocean, in the hope that thou wilt grant him the fleece.  But 
<A NAME="291"></A>as thou dost please, so shall it be, for he cometh not to use force, but 
<A NAME="292"></A>is eager to pay thee a recompense for the gift.  He has heard from me of 
<A NAME="293"></A>thy bitter foes the Sauromatae, and he will subdue them to thy sway.  And 
<A NAME="294"></A>if thou desirest to know their names and lineage I will tell thee all. 
<A NAME="295"></A> This man on whose account the rest were gathered from Hellas, they call 
<A NAME="296"></A>Jason, son of Aeson, whom Cretheus begat.  And if in truth he is of the 
<A NAME="297"></A>stock of Cretheus himself, thus he would be our kinsman on the father's 
<A NAME="298"></A>side.  For Cretheus and Athamas were both sons of Aeolus; and Phrixus was 
<A NAME="299"></A>the son of Athamas, son of Aeolus.  And here, if thou hast heard at all 
<A NAME="300"></A>of the seed of Helios, thou dost behold Augeias; and this is Telamon sprung 
<A NAME="301"></A>from famous Aeacus; and Zeus himself begat Aeacus.  And so all the rest, 
<A NAME="302"></A>all the comrades that follow him, are the sons or grandsons of the 
<A NAME="303"></A>immortals."
<A NAME="304"></A><BR><BR>Such was the tale of Argus; but the king at his words was filled 
<A NAME="305"></A>with rage as he heard; and his heart was lifted high in wrath.  And he 
<A NAME="306"></A>spake in heavy displeasure; and was angered most of all with the son of 
<A NAME="307"></A>Chalciope; for he deemed that on their account the strangers had come; 
<A NAME="308"></A>and in his fury his eyes flashed forth beneath his brows:
<A NAME="309"></A><BR><BR>"Begone from my sight, felons, straightway, ye and your tricks, 
<A NAME="310"></A>from the land, ere someone see a fleece and a Phrixus to his sorrow.  Banded 
<A NAME="311"></A>together with your friends from Hellas, not for the fleece, but to seize 
<A NAME="312"></A>my sceptre and royal power have ye come hither.  Had ye not first tasted 
<A NAME="313"></A>of my table, surely would I have cut out your tongues and hewn off both 
<A NAME="314"></A>hands and sent you forth with your feet alone, so that ye might be stayed 
<A NAME="315"></A>from starting hereafter.  And what lies have ye uttered against the blessed 
<A NAME="316"></A>gods!"
<A NAME="317"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spake in his wrath; and mightily from its depths swelled 
<A NAME="318"></A>the heart of Aeacus' son, and his soul within longed to speak a deadly 
<A NAME="319"></A>word in defiance, but Aeson's son checked him, for he himself first made 
<A NAME="320"></A>gentle answer:
<A NAME="321"></A><BR><BR>"Aeetes, bear with this armed band, I pray.  For not in the way 
<A NAME="322"></A>thou deemest have we come to thy city and palace, no, nor yet with such 
<A NAME="323"></A>desires.  For who would of his own will dare to cross so wide a sea for 
<A NAME="324"></A>the goods of a stranger?  But fate and the ruthless command of a presumptuous 
<A NAME="325"></A>king urged me. Grant a favour to thy suppliants, and to all Hellas will 
<A NAME="326"></A>I publish a glorious fame of thee; yea, we are ready now to pay thee a 
<A NAME="327"></A>swift recompense in war, whether it be the Sauromatae or some other people 
<A NAME="328"></A>that thou art eager to subdue to thy sway."
<A NAME="329"></A><BR><BR>He spake, flattering him with gentle utterance; but the king's 
<A NAME="330"></A>soul brooded a twofold purpose within him, whether he should attack and 
<A NAME="331"></A>slay them on the spot or should make trial of their might.  And this, as 
<A NAME="332"></A>he pondered, seemed the better way, and he addressed Jason in 
<A NAME="333"></A>answer:
<A NAME="334"></A><BR><BR>"Stranger, why needest thou go through thy tale to the end?  For 
<A NAME="335"></A>if ye are in truth of heavenly race, or have come in no wise inferior to 
<A NAME="336"></A>me, to win the goods of strangers, I will give thee the fleece to bear 
<A NAME="337"></A>away, if thou dost wish, when I have tried thee.  For against brave men 
<A NAME="338"></A>I bear no grudge, such as ye yourselves tell me of him who bears sway in 
<A NAME="339"></A>Hellas.  And the trial of your courage and might shall be a contest which 
<A NAME="340"></A>I myself can compass with my hands, deadly though it be.  Two bulls with 
<A NAME="341"></A>feet of bronze I have that pasture on the plain of Ares, breathing forth 
<A NAME="342"></A>flame from their jaws; them do I yoke and drive over the stubborn field 
<A NAME="343"></A>of Ares, four plough-gates; and quickly cleaving it with the share up to 
<A NAME="344"></A>the headland, I cast into the furrows the seed, not the corn of Demeter, 
<A NAME="345"></A>but the teeth of a dread serpent that grow up into the fashion of armed 
<A NAME="346"></A>men; them I slay at once, cutting them down beneath my spear as they rise 
<A NAME="347"></A>against me on all sides.  In the morning do I yoke the oxen, and at eventide 
<A NAME="348"></A>I cease from the harvesting.  And thou, if thou wilt accomplish such deeds 
<A NAME="349"></A>as these, on that very day shalt carry off the fleece to the king's palace; 
<A NAME="350"></A>ere that time comes I will not give it, expect it not.  For indeed it is 
<A NAME="351"></A>unseemly that a brave man should yield to a coward."
<A NAME="352"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spake; and Jason, fixing his eyes on the ground, sat just 
<A NAME="353"></A>as he was, speechless, helpless in his evil plight.  For a long time he 
<A NAME="354"></A>turned the matter this way and that, and could in no way take on him the 
<A NAME="355"></A>task with courage, for a mighty task it seemed; and at last he made reply 
<A NAME="356"></A>with crafty words:
<A NAME="357"></A><BR><BR>"With thy plea of right, Aeetes, thou dost shut me in overmuch. 
<A NAME="358"></A> Wherefore also I will dare that contest, monstrous as it is, though it 
<A NAME="359"></A>be my doom to die. For nothing will fall upon men more dread than dire 
<A NAME="360"></A>necessity, which indeed constrained me to come hither at a king's 
<A NAME="361"></A>command."
<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spake, smitten by his helpless plight; and the king with 
<A NAME="363"></A>grim words addressed him, sore troubled as he was: "Go forth now to the 
<A NAME="364"></A>gathering, since thou art eager for the toil; but if thou shouldst fear 
<A NAME="365"></A>to lift the yoke upon the oxen or shrink from the deadly harvesting, then 
<A NAME="366"></A>all this shall be my care, so that another too may shudder to come to a 
<A NAME="367"></A>man that is better than he."
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR>He spake outright; and Jason rose from his seat, and Augeias and 
<A NAME="369"></A>Telamon at once; and Argus followed alone, for he signed to his brothers 
<A NAME="370"></A>to stay there on the spot meantime; and so they went forth from the hall. 
<A NAME="371"></A> And wonderfully among them all shone the son of Aeson for beauty and grace; 
<A NAME="372"></A>and the maiden looked at him with stealthy glance, holding her bright veil 
<A NAME="373"></A>aside, her heart smouldering with pain; and her soul creeping like a dream 
<A NAME="374"></A>flitted in his track as he went.  So they passed forth from the palace 
<A NAME="375"></A>sorely troubled.  And Chalciope, shielding herself from the wrath of Aeetes, 
<A NAME="376"></A>had gone quickly to her chamber with her sons.  And Medea likewise followed, 
<A NAME="377"></A>and much she brooded in her soul all the cares that the Loves awaken. 
<A NAME="378"></A> And before her eyes the vision still appeared--himself what like he was, 
<A NAME="379"></A>with what vesture he was clad, what things he spake, how he sat on his 
<A NAME="380"></A>seat, how he moved forth to the door--and as she pondered she deemed there 
<A NAME="381"></A>never was such another man; and ever in her ears rung his voice and the 
<A NAME="382"></A>honey-sweet words which he uttered.  And she feared for him, lest the oxen 
<A NAME="383"></A>or Aeetes with his own hand should slay him; and she mourned him as though 
<A NAME="384"></A>already slain outright, and in her affliction a round tear through very 
<A NAME="385"></A>grievous pity coursed down her cheek; and gently weeping she lifted up 
<A NAME="386"></A>her voice aloud:
<A NAME="387"></A><BR><BR>Why does this grief come upon me, poor wretch? Whether he be the 
<A NAME="388"></A>best of heroes now about to perish, or the worst, let him go to his doom. 
<A NAME="389"></A> Yet I would that he had escaped unharmed; yea, may this be so, revered 
<A NAME="390"></A>goddess, daughter of Perses, may he avoid death and return home; but if 
<A NAME="391"></A>it be his lot to be o'ermastered by the oxen, may he first learn this, 
<A NAME="392"></A>that I at least do not rejoice in his cruel calamity."
<A NAME="393"></A><BR><BR>Thus then was the maiden's heart racked by love- cares.  But when 
<A NAME="394"></A>the others had gone forth from the people and the city, along the path 
<A NAME="395"></A>by which at the first they had come from the plain, then Argus addressed 
<A NAME="396"></A>Jason with these words:
<A NAME="397"></A><BR><BR>"Son of Aeson, thou wilt despise the counsel which I will tell 
<A NAME="398"></A>thee, but, though in evil plight, it is not fitting to forbear from the 
<A NAME="399"></A>trial.  Ere now thou hast heard me tell of a maiden that uses sorcery under 
<A NAME="400"></A>the guidance of Hecate, Perses' daughter.  If we could win her aid there 
<A NAME="401"></A>will be no dread, methinks, of thy defeat in the contest; but terribly 
<A NAME="402"></A>do I fear that my mother will not take this task upon her.  Nevertheless 
<A NAME="403"></A>I will go back again to entreat her, for a common destruction overhangs 
<A NAME="404"></A>us all."
<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR>He spake with goodwill, and Jason answered with these words: "Good 
<A NAME="406"></A>friend, if this is good in thy sight, I say not nay.  Go and move thy mother, 
<A NAME="407"></A>beseeching her aid with prudent words; pitiful indeed is our hope when 
<A NAME="408"></A>we have put our return in the keeping of women."  So he spake, and quickly 
<A NAME="409"></A>they reached the back-water.  And their comrades joyfully questioned them, 
<A NAME="410"></A>when they saw them close at hand; and to them spoke Aeson's son grieved 
<A NAME="411"></A>at heart:
<A NAME="412"></A><BR><BR>"My friends, the heart of ruthless Aeetes is utterly filled with 
<A NAME="413"></A>wrath against us, for not at all can the goal be reached either by me or 
<A NAME="414"></A>by you who question me.  He said that two bulls with feet of bronze pasture 
<A NAME="415"></A>on the plain of Ares, breathing forth flame from their jaws.  And with 
<A NAME="416"></A>these he bade me plough the field, four plough-gates; and said that he 
<A NAME="417"></A>would give me from a serpent's jaws seed which will raise up earthborn 
<A NAME="418"></A>men in armour of bronze; and on the same day I must slay them.  This task--for 
<A NAME="419"></A>there was nothing better to devise--I took on myself 
<A NAME="420"></A>outright."
<A NAME="421"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spake; and to all the contest seemed one that none could 
<A NAME="422"></A>accomplish, and long, quiet and silent, they looked at one another, bowed 
<A NAME="423"></A>down with the calamity and their despair; but at last Peleus spake with 
<A NAME="424"></A>courageous words among all the chiefs: "It is time to be counselling what 
<A NAME="425"></A>we shall do.  Yet there is not so much profit, I trow, in counsel as in 
<A NAME="426"></A>the might of our hands.  If thou then, hero son of Aeson, art minded to 
<A NAME="427"></A>yoke Aeetes' oxen, and art eager for the toil, surely thou wilt keep thy 
<A NAME="428"></A>promise and make thyself ready.  But if thy soul trusts not her prowess 
<A NAME="429"></A>utterly, then neither bestir thyself nor sit still and look round for some 
<A NAME="430"></A>one else of these men.  For it is not I who will flinch, since the bitterest 
<A NAME="431"></A>pain will be but death."
<A NAME="432"></A><BR><BR>So spake the son of Aeacus; and Telamon's soul was stirred, and 
<A NAME="433"></A>quickly he started up in eagerness; and Idas rose up the third in his pride; 
<A NAME="434"></A>and the twin sons of Tyndareus; and with them Oeneus' son who was numbered 
<A NAME="435"></A>among strong men, though even the soft down on his cheek showed not yet; 
<A NAME="436"></A>with such courage was his soul uplifted.  But the others gave way to these 
<A NAME="437"></A>in silence. And straightway Argus spake these words to those that longed 
<A NAME="438"></A>for the contest:
<A NAME="439"></A><BR><BR>"My friends, this indeed is left us at the last. But I deem that 
<A NAME="440"></A>there will come to you some timely aid from my mother.  Wherefore, eager 
<A NAME="441"></A>though ye be, refrain and abide in your ship a little longer as before, 
<A NAME="442"></A>for it is better to forbear than recklessly to choose an evil fate.  There 
<A NAME="443"></A>is a maiden, nurtured in the halls of Aeetes, whom the goddess Hecate taught 
<A NAME="444"></A>to handle magic herbs with exceeding skill all that the land and flowing 
<A NAME="445"></A>waters produce.  With them is quenched the blast of unwearied flame, and 
<A NAME="446"></A>at once she stays the course of rivers as they rush roaring on, and checks 
<A NAME="447"></A>the stars and the paths of the sacred moon.  Of her we bethought us as 
<A NAME="448"></A>we came hither along the path from the palace, if haply my mother, her 
<A NAME="449"></A>own sister, might persuade her to aid us in the venture.  And if this is 
<A NAME="450"></A>pleasing to you as well, surely on this very day will I return to the palace 
<A NAME="451"></A>of Aeetes to make trial; and perchance with some god's help shall I make 
<A NAME="452"></A>the trial."
<A NAME="453"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spake, and the gods in their goodwill gave them a sign. 
<A NAME="454"></A> A trembling dove in her flight from a mighty hawk fell from on high, terrified, 
<A NAME="455"></A>into the lap of Aeson's son, and the hawk fell impaled on the stern-ornament. 
<A NAME="456"></A> And quickly Mopsus with prophetic words spake among them 
<A NAME="457"></A>all:
<A NAME="458"></A><BR><BR>"For you, friends, this sign has been wrought by the will of heaven; 
<A NAME="459"></A>in no other way is it possible to interpret its meaning better, than to 
<A NAME="460"></A>seek out the maiden and entreat her with manifold skill.  And I think she 
<A NAME="461"></A>will not reject our prayer, if in truth Phineus said that our return should 
<A NAME="462"></A>be with the help of the Cyprian goddess.  It was her gentle bird that escaped 
<A NAME="463"></A>death; and as my heart within me foresees according to this omen, so may 
<A NAME="464"></A>it prove!  But, my friends, let us call on Cytherea to aid us, and now 
<A NAME="465"></A>at once obey the counsels of Argus."
<A NAME="466"></A><BR><BR>He spake, and the warriors approved, remembering the injunctions 
<A NAME="467"></A>of Phineus; but all alone leapt up Apharcian Idas and shouted loudly in 
<A NAME="468"></A>terrible wrath: "Shame on us, have we come here fellow voyagers with women, 
<A NAME="469"></A>calling on Cypris for help and not on the mighty strength of Enyalius? 
<A NAME="470"></A> And do ye look to doves and hawks to save yourselves from contests?  Away 
<A NAME="471"></A>with you, take thought not for deeds of war, but by supplication to beguile 
<A NAME="472"></A>weakling girls."
<A NAME="473"></A><BR><BR>Such were his eager words; and of his comrades many murmured low, 
<A NAME="474"></A>but none uttered a word of answer back.  And he sat down in wrath; and 
<A NAME="475"></A>at once Jason roused them and uttered his own thought: "Let Argus set forth 
<A NAME="476"></A>from the ship, since this pleases all; but we will now move from the river 
<A NAME="477"></A>and openly fasten our hawsers to the shore.  For surely it is not fitting 
<A NAME="478"></A>for us to hide any longer cowering from the battle-cry."
<A NAME="479"></A><BR><BR>So he spake, and straightway sent Argus to return in haste to the 
<A NAME="480"></A>city; and they drew the anchors on board at the command of Aeson's son, 
<A NAME="481"></A>and rowed the ship close to the shore, a little away from the 
<A NAME="482"></A>back-water.
<A NAME="483"></A><BR><BR>But straightway Aeetes held an assembly of the Colchians far aloof 
<A NAME="484"></A>from his palace at a spot where they sat in times before, to devise against 
<A NAME="485"></A>the Minyae grim treachery and troubles.  And he threatened that when first 
<A NAME="486"></A>the oxen should have torn in pieces the man who had taken upon him to perform 
<A NAME="487"></A>the heavy task, he would hew down the oak grove above the wooded hill, 
<A NAME="488"></A>and burn the ship and her crew, that so they might vent forth in ruin their 
<A NAME="489"></A>grievous insolence, for all their haughty schemes.  For never would he 
<A NAME="490"></A>have welcomed the Aeolid Phrixus as a guest in his halls, in spite of his 
<A NAME="491"></A>sore need, Phrixus, who surpassed all strangers in gentleness and fear 
<A NAME="492"></A>of the gods, had not Zeus himself sent Hermes his messenger down from heaven, 
<A NAME="493"></A>so that he might meet with a friendly host; much less would pirates coming 
<A NAME="494"></A>to his land be let go scatheless for long, men whose care it was to lift 
<A NAME="495"></A>their hands and seize the goods of others, and to weave secret webs of 
<A NAME="496"></A>guile, and harry the steadings of herdsmen with ill-sounding forays.  And 
<A NAME="497"></A>he said that besides all that the sons of Phrixus should pay a fitting 
<A NAME="498"></A>penalty to himself for returning in consort with evildoers, that they might 
<A NAME="499"></A>recklessly drive him from his honour and his throne; for once he had heard 
<A NAME="500"></A>a baleful prophecy from his father Helios, that he must avoid the secret 
<A NAME="501"></A>treachery and schemes of his own offspring and their crafty mischief. 
<A NAME="502"></A> Wherefore he was sending them, as they desired, to the Achaean land at 
<A NAME="503"></A>the bidding of their father--a long journey.  Nor had he ever so slight 
<A NAME="504"></A>a fear of his daughters, that they would form some hateful scheme, nor 
<A NAME="505"></A>of his son Apsyrtus; but this curse was being fulfilled in the children 
<A NAME="506"></A>of Chalciope.  And he proclaimed terrible things in his rage against the 
<A NAME="507"></A>strangers, and loudly threatened to keep watch over the ship and its crew, 
<A NAME="508"></A>so that no one might escape calamity.
<A NAME="509"></A><BR><BR>Meantime Argus, going to Aeetes' palace, with manifold pleading 
<A NAME="510"></A>besought his mother to pray Medea's aid; and Chalciope herself already 
<A NAME="511"></A>had the same thoughts, but fear checked her soul lest haply either fate 
<A NAME="512"></A>should withstand and she should entreat her in vain, all distraught as 
<A NAME="513"></A>she would be at her father's deadly wrath, or, if Medea yielded to her 
<A NAME="514"></A>prayers, her deeds should be laid bare and open to view.
<A NAME="515"></A><BR><BR>Now a deep slumber had relieved the maiden from her love-pains 
<A NAME="516"></A>as she lay upon her couch.  But straightway fearful dreams, deceitful, 
<A NAME="517"></A>such as trouble one in grief, assailed her.  And she thought that the stranger 
<A NAME="518"></A>had taken on him the contest, not because he longed to win the ram's fleece, 
<A NAME="519"></A>and that he had not come on that account to Aeetes' city, but to lead her 
<A NAME="520"></A>away, his wedded wife, to his own home; and she dreamed that herself contended 
<A NAME="521"></A>with the oxen and wrought the task with exceeding ease; and that her own 
<A NAME="522"></A>parents set at naught their promise, for it was not the maiden they had 
<A NAME="523"></A>challenged to yoke the oxen but the stranger himself; from that arose a 
<A NAME="524"></A>contention of doubtful issue between her father and the strangers; and 
<A NAME="525"></A>both laid the decision upon her, to be as she should direct in her mind. 
<A NAME="526"></A> But she suddenly, neglecting her parents, chose the stranger.  And measureless 
<A NAME="527"></A>anguish seized them and they shouted out in their wrath; and with the cry 
<A NAME="528"></A>sleep released its hold upon her.  Quivering with fear she started up, 
<A NAME="529"></A>and stared round the walls of her chamber, and with difficulty did she 
<A NAME="530"></A>gather her spirit within her as before, and lifted her voice 
<A NAME="531"></A>aloud:
<A NAME="532"></A><BR><BR>"Poor wretch, how have gloomy dreams affrighted me!  I fear that 
<A NAME="533"></A>this voyage of the heroes will bring some great evil.  My heart is trembling 
<A NAME="534"></A>for the stranger.  Let him woo some Achaean girl far away among his own 
<A NAME="535"></A>folk; let maidenhood be mine and the home of my parents.  Yet, taking to 
<A NAME="536"></A>myself a reckless heart, I will no more keep aloof but will make trial 
<A NAME="537"></A>of my sister to see if she will entreat me to aid in the contest, through 
<A NAME="538"></A>grief for her own sons; this would quench the bitter pain in my 
<A NAME="539"></A>heart."
<A NAME="540"></A><BR><BR>She spake, and rising from her bed opened the door of her chamber, 
<A NAME="541"></A>bare-footed, clad in one robe; and verily she desired to go to her sister, 
<A NAME="542"></A>and crossed the threshold.  And for long she stayed there at the entrance 
<A NAME="543"></A>of her chamber, held back by shame; and she turned back once more; and 
<A NAME="544"></A>again she came forth from within, and again stole back; and idly did her 
<A NAME="545"></A>feet bear her this way and that; yea, as oft as she went straight on, shame 
<A NAME="546"></A>held her within the chamber, and though held back by shame, bold desire 
<A NAME="547"></A>kept urging her on.  Thrice she made the attempt and thrice she checked 
<A NAME="548"></A>herself, the fourth time she fell on her bed face downward, writhing in 
<A NAME="549"></A>pain.  And as when a bride in her chamber bewails her youthful husband, 
<A NAME="550"></A>to whom her brothers and parents have given her, nor yet does she hold 
<A NAME="551"></A>converse with all her attendants for shame and for thinking of him; but 
<A NAME="552"></A>she sits apart in her grief; and some doom has destroyed him, before they 
<A NAME="553"></A>have had pleasure of each other's charms; and she with heart on fire silently 
<A NAME="554"></A>weeps, beholding her widowed couch, in fear lest the women should mock 
<A NAME="555"></A>and revile her; like to her did Medea lament.  And suddenly as she was 
<A NAME="556"></A>in the midst of her tears, one of the handmaids came forth and noticed 
<A NAME="557"></A>her, one who was her youthful attendant; and straightway she told Chalciope, 
<A NAME="558"></A>who sat in the midst of her sons devising how to win over her sister. And 
<A NAME="559"></A>when Chalciope heard the strange tale from the handmaid, not even so did 
<A NAME="560"></A>she disregard it.  And she rushed in dismay from her chamber right on to 
<A NAME="561"></A>the chamber where the maiden lay in her anguish, having torn her cheeks 
<A NAME="562"></A>on each side; and when Chalciope saw her eyes all dimmed with tears, she 
<A NAME="563"></A>thus addressed her:
<A NAME="564"></A><BR><BR>"Ah me, Medea, why dost thou weep so?  What hath befallen thee? 
<A NAME="565"></A> What terrible grief has entered thy heart?  Has some heaven-sent disease 
<A NAME="566"></A>enwrapt thy frame, or hast thou heard from our father some deadly threat 
<A NAME="567"></A>concerning me and my sons? Would that I did not behold this home of my 
<A NAME="568"></A>parents, or the city, but dwelt at the ends of the earth, where not even 
<A NAME="569"></A>the name of Colchians is known!"
<A NAME="570"></A><BR><BR>Thus she spake, and her sister's cheeks flushed; and though she 
<A NAME="571"></A>was eager to reply, long did maiden shame restrain her.  At one moment 
<A NAME="572"></A>the word rose on the end of her tongue, at another it fluttered back deep 
<A NAME="573"></A>within her breast.  And often through her lovely lips it strove for utterance; 
<A NAME="574"></A>but no sound came forth; till at last she spoke with guileful words; for 
<A NAME="575"></A>the bold Loves were pressing her hard:
<A NAME="576"></A><BR><BR>"Chalciope, my heart is all trembling for thy sons, lest my father 
<A NAME="577"></A>forthwith destroy them together with the strangers.  Slumbering just now 
<A NAME="578"></A>in a short-lived sleep such a ghastly dream did I see--may some god forbid 
<A NAME="579"></A>its fulfilment and never mayst thou win for thyself bitter care on thy 
<A NAME="580"></A>sons' account."
<A NAME="581"></A><BR><BR>She spake, making trial of her sister to see if she first would 
<A NAME="582"></A>entreat help for her sons.  And utterly unbearable grief surged over Chalciope's 
<A NAME="583"></A>soul for fear at what she heard; and then she replied: "Yea, I myself too 
<A NAME="584"></A>have come to thee in eager furtherance of this purpose, if thou wouldst 
<A NAME="585"></A>haply devise with me and prepare some help.  But swear by Earth and Heaven 
<A NAME="586"></A>that thou wilt keep secret in thy heart what I shall tell thee, and be 
<A NAME="587"></A>fellow-worker with me.  I implore thee by the blessed gods, by thyself 
<A NAME="588"></A>and by thy parents, not to see them destroyed by an evil doom piteously; 
<A NAME="589"></A>or else may I die with my dear sons and come back hereafter from Hades 
<A NAME="590"></A>an avenging Fury to haunt thee."
<A NAME="591"></A><BR><BR>Thus she spake, and straightway a torrent of tears gushed forth 
<A NAME="592"></A>and low down she clasped her sister's knees with both hands and let her 
<A NAME="593"></A>head sink on to her breast.  Then they both made piteous lamentation over 
<A NAME="594"></A>each other, and through the halls rose the faint sound of women weeping 
<A NAME="595"></A>in anguish.  Medea, sore troubled, first addressed her 
<A NAME="596"></A>sister:
<A NAME="597"></A><BR><BR>"God help thee, what healing can I bring thee for what thou speakest 
<A NAME="598"></A>of, horrible curses and Furies?  Would that it were firmly in my power 
<A NAME="599"></A>to save thy sons!  Be witness that mighty oath of the Colchians by which 
<A NAME="600"></A>thou urgest me to swear, the great Heaven, and Earth beneath, mother of 
<A NAME="601"></A>the gods, that as far as strength lies in me, never shalt thou fail of 
<A NAME="602"></A>help, if only thy prayers can be accomplished."
<A NAME="603"></A><BR><BR>She spake, and Chalciope thus replied: "Couldst thou not then, 
<A NAME="604"></A>for the stranger--who himself craves thy aid -- devise some trick or some 
<A NAME="605"></A>wise thought to win the contest, for the sake of my sons?  And from him 
<A NAME="606"></A>has come Argus urging me to try to win thy help; I left him in the palace 
<A NAME="607"></A>meantime while I came hither."
<A NAME="608"></A><BR><BR>Thus she spake, and Medea's heart bounded with joy within her, 
<A NAME="609"></A>and at once her fair cheeks flushed, and a mist swam before her melting 
<A NAME="610"></A>eyes, and she spake as follows: "Chalciope, as is dear and delightful to 
<A NAME="611"></A>thee and thy sons, even so will I do. Never may the dawn appear again to 
<A NAME="612"></A>my eyes, never mayst thou see me living any longer, if I should take thought 
<A NAME="613"></A>for anything before thy life or thy sons' lives, for they are my brothers, 
<A NAME="614"></A>my dear kinsmen and youthful companions.  So do I declare myself to be 
<A NAME="615"></A>thy sister, and thy daughter too, for thou didst lift me to thy breast 
<A NAME="616"></A>when an infant equally with them, as I ever heard from my mother in past 
<A NAME="617"></A>days.  But go, bury my kindness in silence, so that I may carry out my 
<A NAME="618"></A>promise unknown to my parents; and at dawn I will bring to Hecate's temple 
<A NAME="619"></A>charms to cast a spell upon the bulls."
<A NAME="620"></A><BR><BR>Thus Chalciope went back from the chamber, and made known to her 
<A NAME="621"></A>sons the help given by her sister.  And again did shame and hateful fear 
<A NAME="622"></A>seize Medea thus left alone, that she should devise such deeds for a man 
<A NAME="623"></A>in her father's despite.
<A NAME="624"></A><BR><BR>Then did night draw darkness over the earth; and on the sea sailors 
<A NAME="625"></A>from their ships looked towards the Bear and the stars of Orion; and now 
<A NAME="626"></A>the wayfarer and the warder longed for sleep, and the pall of slumber wrapped 
<A NAME="627"></A>round the mother whose children were dead; nor was there any more the barking 
<A NAME="628"></A>of dogs through the city, nor sound of men's voices; but silence held the 
<A NAME="629"></A>blackening gloom.  But not indeed upon Medea came sweet sleep. For in her 
<A NAME="630"></A>love for Aeson's son many cares kept her wakeful, and she dreaded the mighty 
<A NAME="631"></A>strength of the bulls, beneath whose fury he was like to perish by an unseemly 
<A NAME="632"></A>fate in the field of Ares. And fast did her heart throb within her breast, 
<A NAME="633"></A>as a sunbeam quivers upon the walls of a house when flung up from water, 
<A NAME="634"></A>which is just poured forth in a caldron or a pail may be; and hither and 
<A NAME="635"></A>thither on the swift eddy does it dart and dance along; even so the maiden's 
<A NAME="636"></A>heart quivered in her breast.  And the tear of pity flowed from her eyes, 
<A NAME="637"></A>and ever within anguish tortured her, a smouldering fire through her frame, 
<A NAME="638"></A>and about her fine nerves and deep down beneath the nape of the neck where 
<A NAME="639"></A>the pain enters keenest, whenever the unwearied Loves direct against the 
<A NAME="640"></A>heart their shafts of agony.  And she thought now that she would give him 
<A NAME="641"></A>the charms to cast a spell on the bulls, now that she would not, and that 
<A NAME="642"></A>she herself would perish; and again that she would not perish and would 
<A NAME="643"></A>not give the charms, but just as she was would endure her fate in silence. 
<A NAME="644"></A> Then sitting down she wavered in mind and said:
<A NAME="645"></A><BR><BR>"Poor wretch, must I toss hither and thither in woe?  On every 
<A NAME="646"></A>side my heart is in despair; nor is there any help for my pain; but it 
<A NAME="647"></A>burneth ever thus.  Would that I had been slain by the swift shafts of 
<A NAME="648"></A>Artemis before I had set eyes on him, before Chalciope's sons reached the 
<A NAME="649"></A>Achaean land.  Some god or some Fury brought them hither for our grief, 
<A NAME="650"></A>a cause of many tears.  Let him perish in the contest if it be his lot 
<A NAME="651"></A>to die in the field.  For how could I prepare the charms without my parents' 
<A NAME="652"></A>knowledge?  What story call I tell them?  What trick, what cunning device 
<A NAME="653"></A>for aid can I find?  If I see him alone, apart from his comrades, shall 
<A NAME="654"></A>I greet him?  Ill-starred that I am!  I cannot hope that I should rest 
<A NAME="655"></A>from my sorrows even though he perished; then will evil come to me when 
<A NAME="656"></A>he is bereft of life. Perish all shame, perish all glow; may he, saved 
<A NAME="657"></A>by my effort, go scatheless wherever his heart desires.  But as for me, 
<A NAME="658"></A>on the day when he bides the contest in triumph, may I die either straining 
<A NAME="659"></A>my neck in the noose from the roof-tree or tasting drugs destructive of 
<A NAME="660"></A>life.  But even so, when I am dead, they will fling out taunts against 
<A NAME="661"></A>me; and every city far away will ring with my doom, and the Colchian women, 
<A NAME="662"></A>tossing my name on their lips hither and thither, will revile me with unseemly 
<A NAME="663"></A>mocking -- the maid who cared so much for a stranger that she died, the 
<A NAME="664"></A>maid who disgraced her home and her parents, yielding to a mad passion. 
<A NAME="665"></A> And what disgrace will not be mine?  Alas for my infatuation!  Far better 
<A NAME="666"></A>would it be for me to forsake life this very night in my chamber by some 
<A NAME="667"></A>mysterious fate, escaping all slanderous reproach, before I complete such 
<A NAME="668"></A>nameless dishonour."
<A NAME="669"></A><BR><BR>She spake, and brought a casket wherein lay many drugs, some for 
<A NAME="670"></A>healing, others for killing, and placing it upon her knees she wept.  And 
<A NAME="671"></A>she drenched her bosom with ceaseless tears, which flowed in torrents as 
<A NAME="672"></A>she sat, bitterly bewailing her own fate.  And she longed to choose a murderous 
<A NAME="673"></A>drug to taste it, and now she was loosening the bands of the casket eager 
<A NAME="674"></A>to take it forth, unhappy maid!  But suddenly a deadly fear of hateful 
<A NAME="675"></A>Hades came upon her heart.  And long she held back in speechless horror, 
<A NAME="676"></A>and all around her thronged visions of the pleasing cares of life.  She 
<A NAME="677"></A>thought of all the delightful things that are among the living, she thought 
<A NAME="678"></A>of her joyous playmates, as a maiden will; and the sun grew sweeter than 
<A NAME="679"></A>ever to behold, seeing that in truth her soul yearned for all.  And she 
<A NAME="680"></A>put the casket again from off her knees, all changed by the prompting of 
<A NAME="681"></A>Hera, and no more did she waver in purpose; but longed for the rising dawn 
<A NAME="682"></A>to appear quickly, that she might give him the charms to work the spell 
<A NAME="683"></A>as she had promised, and meet him face to face. And often did she loosen 
<A NAME="684"></A>the bolts of her door, to watch for the faint gleam: and welcome to her 
<A NAME="685"></A>did the dayspring shed its light, and folk began to stir throughout the 
<A NAME="686"></A>city.
<A NAME="687"></A><BR><BR>Then Argus bade his brothers remain there to learn the maiden's 
<A NAME="688"></A>mind and plans, but himself turned back and went to the 
<A NAME="689"></A>ship.
<A NAME="690"></A><BR><BR>Now soon as ever the maiden saw the light of dawn, with her hands 
<A NAME="691"></A>she gathered up her golden tresses which were floating round her shoulders 
<A NAME="692"></A>in careless disarray, and bathed her tear-stained cheeks, and made her 
<A NAME="693"></A>skin shine with ointment sweet as nectar; and she donned a beautiful robe, 
<A NAME="694"></A>fitted with well-bent clasps, and above on her head, divinely fair, she 
<A NAME="695"></A>threw a veil gleaming like silver.  And there, moving to and fro in the 
<A NAME="696"></A>palace, she trod the ground forgetful of the heaven-sent woes thronging 
<A NAME="697"></A>round her and of others that were destined to follow. And she called to 
<A NAME="698"></A>her maids.  Twelve they were, who lay during the night in the vestibule 
<A NAME="699"></A>of her fragrant chamber, young as herself, not yet sharing the bridal couch, 
<A NAME="700"></A>and she bade them hastily yoke the mules to the chariot to bear her to 
<A NAME="701"></A>the beauteous shrine of Hecate.  Thereupon the handmaids were making ready 
<A NAME="702"></A>the chariot; and Medea meanwhile took from the hollow casket a charm which 
<A NAME="703"></A>men say is called the charm of Prometheus. If a man should anoint his body 
<A NAME="704"></A>therewithal, having first appeased the Maiden, the only-begotten, with 
<A NAME="705"></A>sacrifice by night, surely that man could not be wounded by the stroke 
<A NAME="706"></A>of bronze nor would he flinch from blazing fire; but for that day he would 
<A NAME="707"></A>prove superior both in prowess and in might.  It shot up first- born when 
<A NAME="708"></A>the ravening eagle on the rugged flanks of Caucasus let drip to the earth 
<A NAME="709"></A>the blood-like ichor of tortured Prometheus. And its flower appeared a 
<A NAME="710"></A>cubit above ground in colour like the Corycian crocus, rising on twin stalks; 
<A NAME="711"></A>but in the earth the root was like newly-cut flesh.  The dark juice of 
<A NAME="712"></A>it, like the sap of a mountain-oak, she had gathered in a Caspian shell 
<A NAME="713"></A>to make the charm withal, when she had first bathed in seven ever-flowing 
<A NAME="714"></A>streams, and had called seven times on Brimo, nurse of youth, night-wandering 
<A NAME="715"></A>Brimo, of the underworld, queen among the dead, -- in the gloom of night, 
<A NAME="716"></A>clad in dusky garments.  And beneath, the dark earth shook and bellowed 
<A NAME="717"></A>when the Titanian root was cut; and the son of Iapetus himself groaned, 
<A NAME="718"></A>his soul distraught with pain.  And she brought the charm forth and placed 
<A NAME="719"></A>it in the fragrant band which engirdled her, just beneath her bosom, divinely 
<A NAME="720"></A>fair.  And going forth she mounted the swift chariot, and with her went 
<A NAME="721"></A>two handmaidens on each side.  And she herself took the reins and in her 
<A NAME="722"></A>right hand the well-fashioned whip, and drove through the city; and the 
<A NAME="723"></A>rest, the handmaids, laid their hands on the chariot behind and ran along 
<A NAME="724"></A>the broad highway; and they kilted up their light robes above their white 
<A NAME="725"></A>knees.  And even as by the mild waters of Parthenius, or after bathing 
<A NAME="726"></A>in the river Amnisus, Leto's daughter stands upon her golden chariot and 
<A NAME="727"></A>courses over the hills with her swift-footed roes, to greet from afar some 
<A NAME="728"></A>richly-steaming hecatomb; and with her come the nymphs in attendance, gathering, 
<A NAME="729"></A>some at the spring of Amnisus itself, others by the glens and many-fountained 
<A NAME="730"></A>peaks; and round her whine and fawn the beasts cowering as she moves along: 
<A NAME="731"></A>thus they sped through the city; and on both sides the people gave way, 
<A NAME="732"></A>shunning the eyes of the royal maiden.  But when she had left the city's 
<A NAME="733"></A>well paved streets, and was approaching the shrine as she drove over the 
<A NAME="734"></A>plains, then she alighted eagerly from the smooth- running chariot and 
<A NAME="735"></A>spake as follows among her maidens:
<A NAME="736"></A><BR><BR>"Friends, verily have I sinned greatly and took no heed not to 
<A NAME="737"></A>go among the stranger-folk who roam over our land. The whole city is smitten 
<A NAME="738"></A>with dismay; wherefore no one of the women who formerly gathered here day 
<A NAME="739"></A>by day has now come hither. But since we have come and no one else draws 
<A NAME="740"></A>near, come, let us satisfy our souls without stint with soothing song, 
<A NAME="741"></A>and when we have plucked the fair flowers amid the tender grass, that very 
<A NAME="742"></A>hour will we return.  And with many a gift shall ye reach home this very 
<A NAME="743"></A>day, if ye will gladden me with this desire of mine. For Argus pleads with 
<A NAME="744"></A>me, also Chalciope herself; but this that ye hear from me keep silently 
<A NAME="745"></A>in your hearts, lest the tale reach my father's ears.  As for yon stranger 
<A NAME="746"></A>who took on him the task with the oxen, they bid me receive his gifts and 
<A NAME="747"></A>rescue him from the deadly contest.  And I approved their counsel, and 
<A NAME="748"></A>I have summoned him to come to my presence apart from his comrades, so 
<A NAME="749"></A>that we may divide the gifts among ourselves if he bring them in his hands, 
<A NAME="750"></A>and in return may give him a baleful charm.  But when he comes, do ye stand 
<A NAME="751"></A>aloof."
<A NAME="752"></A><BR><BR>So she spake, and the crafty counsel pleased them all.  And straightway 
<A NAME="753"></A>Argus drew Aeson's son apart from his comrades as soon as he heard from 
<A NAME="754"></A>his brothers that Medea had gone at daybreak to the holy shrine of Hecate, 
<A NAME="755"></A>and led him over the plain; and with them went Mopsus, son of Ampycus, 
<A NAME="756"></A>skilled to utter oracles from the appearance of birds, and skilled to give 
<A NAME="757"></A>good counsel to those who set out on a journey.
<A NAME="758"></A><BR><BR>Never yet had there been such a man in the days of old, neither 
<A NAME="759"></A>of all the heroes of the lineage of Zeus himself, nor of those who sprung 
<A NAME="760"></A>from the blood of the other gods, as on that day the bride of Zeus made 
<A NAME="761"></A>Jason, both to look upon and to hold converse with.  Even his comrades 
<A NAME="762"></A>wondered as they gazed upon him, radiant with manifold graces; and the 
<A NAME="763"></A>son of Ampycus rejoiced in their journey, already foreboding how all would 
<A NAME="764"></A>end.
<A NAME="765"></A><BR><BR>Now by the path along the plain there stands near the shrine a 
<A NAME="766"></A>poplar with its crown of countless leaves, whereon often chattering crows 
<A NAME="767"></A>would roost.  One of them meantime as she clapped her wings aloft in the 
<A NAME="768"></A>branches uttered the counsels of Hera:
<A NAME="769"></A><BR><BR>"What a pitiful seer is this, that has not the wit to conceive 
<A NAME="770"></A>even what children know, how that no maiden will say a word of sweetness 
<A NAME="771"></A>or love to a youth when strangers be near. Begone, sorry prophet, witless 
<A NAME="772"></A>one; on thee neither Cypris nor the gentle Loves breathe in their 
<A NAME="773"></A>kindness."
<A NAME="774"></A><BR><BR>She spake chiding, and Mopsus smiled to hear the god-sent voice 
<A NAME="775"></A>of the bird, and thus addressed them: "Do thou, son of Aeson, pass on to 
<A NAME="776"></A>the temple, where thou wilt find the maiden; and very kind will her greeting 
<A NAME="777"></A>be to thee through the prompting of Cypris, who will be thy helpmate in 
<A NAME="778"></A>the contest, even as Phineus, Agenor's son, foretold.  But we two, Argus 
<A NAME="779"></A>and I, will await thy return, apart in this very spot; do thou all alone 
<A NAME="780"></A>be a suppliant and win her over with prudent words."
<A NAME="781"></A><BR><BR>He spake wisely, and both at once gave approval. Nor was Medea's 
<A NAME="782"></A>heart turned to other thoughts, for all her singing, and never a song that 
<A NAME="783"></A>she essayed pleased her long in her sport.  But in confusion she ever faltered, 
<A NAME="784"></A>nor did she keep her eyes resting quietly upon the throng of her handmaids; 
<A NAME="785"></A>but to the paths far off she strained her gaze, turning her face aside. 
<A NAME="786"></A>Oft did her heart sink fainting within her bosom whenever she fancied she 
<A NAME="787"></A>heard passing by the sound of a footfall or of the wind.  But soon he appeared 
<A NAME="788"></A>to her longing eyes, striding along loftily, like Sirius coming from ocean, 
<A NAME="789"></A>which rises fair and clear to see, but brings unspeakable mischief to flocks; 
<A NAME="790"></A>thus then did Aeson's son come to her, fair to see, but the sight of him 
<A NAME="791"></A>brought love-sick care.  Her heart fell from out her bosom, and a dark 
<A NAME="792"></A>mist came over her eyes, and a hot blush covered her cheeks.  And she had 
<A NAME="793"></A>no strength to lift her knees backwards or forwards, but her feet beneath 
<A NAME="794"></A>were rooted to the ground; and meantime all her handmaidens had drawn aside. 
<A NAME="795"></A> So they two stood face to face without a word, without a sound, like oaks 
<A NAME="796"></A>or lofty pines, which stand quietly side by side on the mountains when 
<A NAME="797"></A>the wind is still; then again, when stirred by the breath of the wind, 
<A NAME="798"></A>they murmur ceaselessly; so they two were destined to tell out all their 
<A NAME="799"></A>tale, stirred by the breath of Love.  And Aeson's son saw that she had 
<A NAME="800"></A>fallen into some heaven-sent calamity, and with soothing words thus addressed 
<A NAME="801"></A>her:
<A NAME="802"></A><BR><BR>"Why, pray, maiden, dost thou fear me so much, all alone as I am? 
<A NAME="803"></A> Never was I one of these idle boasters such as other men are--not even 
<A NAME="804"></A>aforetime, when I dwelt in my own country.  Wherefore, maiden, be not too 
<A NAME="805"></A>much abashed before me, either to enquire whatever thou wilt or to speak 
<A NAME="806"></A>thy mind.  But since we have met one another with friendly hearts, in a 
<A NAME="807"></A>hallowed spot, where it is wrong to sin, speak openly and ask questions, 
<A NAME="808"></A>and beguile me not with pleasing words, for at the first thou didst promise 
<A NAME="809"></A>thy sister to give me the charms my heart desires. I implore thee by Hecate 
<A NAME="810"></A>herself, by thy parents, and by Zeus who holds his guardian hand over strangers 
<A NAME="811"></A>and suppliants; I come here to thee both a suppliant and a stranger, bending 
<A NAME="812"></A>the knee in my sore need.  For without thee and thy sister never shall 
<A NAME="813"></A>I prevail in the grievous contest.  And to thee will I render thanks hereafter 
<A NAME="814"></A>for thy aid, as is right and fitting for men who dwell far oft, making 
<A NAME="815"></A>glorious thy name and fame; and the rest of the heroes, returning to Hellas, 
<A NAME="816"></A>will spread thy renown and so will the heroes' wives and mothers, who now 
<A NAME="817"></A>perhaps are sitting on the shore and making moan for us; their painful 
<A NAME="818"></A>affliction thou mightest scatter to the winds.  In days past the maiden 
<A NAME="819"></A>Ariadne, daughter of Minos, with kindly intent rescued Theseus from grim 
<A NAME="820"></A>contests--the maiden whom Pasiphae daughter of Helios bare.  But she, when 
<A NAME="821"></A>Minos had lulled his wrath to rest, went aboard the ship with him and left 
<A NAME="822"></A>her fatherland; and her even the immortal gods loved, and, as a sign in 
<A NAME="823"></A>mid-sky, a crown of stars, which men call Ariadne's crown, rolls along 
<A NAME="824"></A>all night among the heavenly constellations.  So to thee too shall be thanks 
<A NAME="825"></A>from the gods, if thou wilt save so mighty an array of chieftains.  For 
<A NAME="826"></A>surely from thy lovely form thou art like to excel in gentle 
<A NAME="827"></A>courtest."
<A NAME="828"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spake, honouring her; and she cast her eyes down with a 
<A NAME="829"></A>smile divinely sweet; and her soul melted within her, uplifted by his praise, 
<A NAME="830"></A>and she gazed upon him face to face; nor did she know what word to utter 
<A NAME="831"></A>first, but was eager to pour out everything at once.  And forth from her 
<A NAME="832"></A>fragrant girdle ungrudgingly she brought out the charm; and he at once 
<A NAME="833"></A>received it in his hands with joy.  And she would even have drawn out all 
<A NAME="834"></A>her soul from her breast and given it to him, exulting in his desire; so 
<A NAME="835"></A>wonderfully did love flash forth a sweet flame from the golden head of 
<A NAME="836"></A>Aeson's son; and he captivated her gleaming eyes; and her heart within 
<A NAME="837"></A>grew warm, melting away as the dew melts away round roses when warmed by 
<A NAME="838"></A>the morning's light.  And now both were fixing their eyes on the ground 
<A NAME="839"></A>abashed, and again were throwing glances at each other, smiling with the 
<A NAME="840"></A>light of love beneath their radiant brows.  And at last and scarcely then 
<A NAME="841"></A>did the maiden greet him:
<A NAME="842"></A><BR><BR>"Take heed now, that I may devise help for thee. When at thy coming 
<A NAME="843"></A>my father has given thee the deadly teeth from the dragon's jaws for sowing, 
<A NAME="844"></A>then watch for the time when the night is parted in twain, then bathe in 
<A NAME="845"></A>the stream of the tireless river, and alone, apart from others, clad in 
<A NAME="846"></A>dusky raiment, dig a rounded pit; and therein slay a ewe, and sacrifice 
<A NAME="847"></A>it whole, heaping high the pyre on the very edge of the pit.  And propitiate 
<A NAME="848"></A>only-begotten Hecate, daughter of Perses, pouring from a goblet the hive-stored 
<A NAME="849"></A>labour of bees.  And then, when thou hast heedfully sought the grace of 
<A NAME="850"></A>the goddess, retreat from the pyre; and let neither the sound of feet drive 
<A NAME="851"></A>thee to turn back, nor the baying of hounds, lest haply thou shouldst maim 
<A NAME="852"></A>all the rites and thyself fail to return duly to thy comrades.  And at 
<A NAME="853"></A>dawn steep this charm in water, strip, and anoint thy body therewith as 
<A NAME="854"></A>with oil; and in it there will be boundless prowess and mighty strength, 
<A NAME="855"></A>and thou wilt deem thyself a match not for men but for the immortal gods. 
<A NAME="856"></A> And besides, let thy spear and shield and sword be sprinkled.  Thereupon 
<A NAME="857"></A>the spear-heads of the earthborn men shall not pierce thee, nor the flame 
<A NAME="858"></A>of the deadly bulls as it rushes forth resistless.  But such thou shalt 
<A NAME="859"></A>be not for long, but for that one day; still never flinch from the contest. 
<A NAME="860"></A> And I will tell thee besides of yet another help.  As soon as thou hast 
<A NAME="861"></A>yoked the strong oxen, and with thy might and thy prowess hast ploughed 
<A NAME="862"></A>all the stubborn fallow, and now along the furrows the Giants are springing 
<A NAME="863"></A>up, when the serpent's teeth are sown on the dusky clods, if thou markest 
<A NAME="864"></A>them uprising in throngs from the fallow, cast unseen among them a massy 
<A NAME="865"></A>stone; and they over it, like ravening hounds over their food, will slay 
<A NAME="866"></A>one another; and do thou thyself hasten to rush to the battle- strife, 
<A NAME="867"></A>and the fleece thereupon thou shalt bear far away from Aea; nevertheless, 
<A NAME="868"></A>depart wherever thou wilt, or thy pleasure takes thee, when thou hast gone 
<A NAME="869"></A>hence."
<A NAME="870"></A><BR><BR>Thus she spake, and cast her eyes to her feet in silence, and her 
<A NAME="871"></A>cheek, divinely fair, was wet with warm tears as she sorrowed for that 
<A NAME="872"></A>he was about to wander far from her side over the wide sea: and once again 
<A NAME="873"></A>she addressed him face to face with mournful words, and took his right 
<A NAME="874"></A>hand; for now shame had left her eyes:
<A NAME="875"></A><BR><BR>"Remember, if haply thou returnest to thy home, Medea's name; and 
<A NAME="876"></A>so will I remember thine, though thou be far away.  And of thy kindness 
<A NAME="877"></A>tell me this, where is thy home, whither wilt thou sail hence in thy ship 
<A NAME="878"></A>over the sea; wilt thou come near wealthy Orchomenus, or near the Aeaean 
<A NAME="879"></A>isle?  And tell me of the maiden, whosoever she be that thou hast named, 
<A NAME="880"></A>the far-renowned daughter of Pasiphae, who is kinswoman to my 
<A NAME="881"></A>father."
<A NAME="882"></A><BR><BR>Thus she spake; and over him too, at the tears of the maiden, stole 
<A NAME="883"></A>Love the destroyer, and he thus answered her:
<A NAME="884"></A><BR><BR>"All too surely do I deem that never by night and never by day 
<A NAME="885"></A>will I forget thee if I escape death and indeed make my way in safety to 
<A NAME="886"></A>the Achaean land, and Aeetes set not before us some other contest worse 
<A NAME="887"></A>than this.  And if it pleases thee to know about my fatherland, I will 
<A NAME="888"></A>tell it out; for indeed my own heart bids me do that.  There is a land 
<A NAME="889"></A>encircled by lofty mountains, rich in sheep and in pasture, where Prometheus, 
<A NAME="890"></A>son of Iapetus, begat goodly Deucalion, who first founded cities and reared 
<A NAME="891"></A>temples to the immortal gods, and first ruled over men. This land the neighbours 
<A NAME="892"></A>who dwell around call Haemonia.  And in it stands Ioleus, my city, and 
<A NAME="893"></A>in it many others, where they have not so much as heard the name of the 
<A NAME="894"></A>Aeaean isle; yet there is a story that Minyas starting thence, Minyas son 
<A NAME="895"></A>of Aeolus, built long ago the city of Orchomenus that borders on the Cadmeians. 
<A NAME="896"></A>But why do I tell thee all this vain talk, of our home and of Minos' daughter, 
<A NAME="897"></A>far-famed Ariadne, by which glorious name they called that lovely maiden 
<A NAME="898"></A>of whom thou askest me?  Would that, as Minos then was well inclined to 
<A NAME="899"></A>Theseus for her sake, so may thy father be joined to us in 
<A NAME="900"></A>friendship!"
<A NAME="901"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spake, soothing her with gentle converse.  But pangs most 
<A NAME="902"></A>bitter stirred her heart and in grief did she address him with vehement 
<A NAME="903"></A>words:
<A NAME="904"></A><BR><BR>"In Hellas, I ween, this is fair to pay heed to covenants; but 
<A NAME="905"></A>Aeetes is not such a man among men as thou sayest was Pasiphae's husband, 
<A NAME="906"></A>Minos; nor can I liken myself to Ariadne; wherefore speak not of guest-love. 
<A NAME="907"></A> But only do thou, when thou hast reached Iolcus, remember me, and thee 
<A NAME="908"></A>even in my parents' despite, will I remember.  And from far off may a rumour 
<A NAME="909"></A>come to me or some messenger-bird, when thou forgettest me; or me, even 
<A NAME="910"></A>me, may swift blasts catch up and bear over the sea hence to Iolcus, that 
<A NAME="911"></A>so I may cast reproaches in thy face and remind thee that it was by my 
<A NAME="912"></A>good will thou didst escape.  May I then be seated in thy halls, an unexpected 
<A NAME="913"></A>guest!"
<A NAME="914"></A><BR><BR>Thus she spake with piteous tears falling down her cheeks, and 
<A NAME="915"></A>to her Jason replied: "Let the empty blasts wander at will, lady, and the 
<A NAME="916"></A>messenger-bird, for vain is thy talk.  But if thou comest to those abodes 
<A NAME="917"></A>and to the land of Hellas, honoured and reverenced shalt thou be by women 
<A NAME="918"></A>and men; and they shall worship thee even as a goddess, for that by thy 
<A NAME="919"></A>counsel their sons came home again, their brothers and kinsmen and stalwart 
<A NAME="920"></A>husbands were saved from calamity.  And in our bridal chamber shalt thou 
<A NAME="921"></A>prepare our couch; and nothing shall come between our love till the doom 
<A NAME="922"></A>of death fold us round."
<A NAME="923"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spake; and her soul melted within her to hear his words; 
<A NAME="924"></A>nevertheless she shuddered to behold the deeds of destruction to come. 
<A NAME="925"></A> Poor wretch!  Not long was she destined to refuse a home in Hellas.  For 
<A NAME="926"></A>thus Hera devised it, that Aeaean Medea might come to Ioleus for a bane 
<A NAME="927"></A>to Pelias, forsaking her native land.
<A NAME="928"></A><BR><BR>And now her handmaids, glancing at them from a distance, were grieving 
<A NAME="929"></A>in silence; and the time of day required that the maiden should return 
<A NAME="930"></A>home to her mother's side.  But she thought not yet of departing, for her 
<A NAME="931"></A>soul delighted both in his beauty and in his winsome words, but Aeson's 
<A NAME="932"></A>son took heed, and spake at last, though late: "It is time to depart, lest 
<A NAME="933"></A>the sunlight sink before we know it, and some stranger notice all; but 
<A NAME="934"></A>again will we come and meet here."
<A NAME="935"></A><BR><BR>So did they two make trial of one another thus far with gentle 
<A NAME="936"></A>words; and thereafter parted.  Jason hastened to return in joyous mood 
<A NAME="937"></A>to his comrades and the ship, she to her handmaids; and they all together 
<A NAME="938"></A>came near to meet her, but she marked them not at all as they thronged 
<A NAME="939"></A>around.  For her soul had soared aloft amid the clouds.  And her feet of 
<A NAME="940"></A>their own accord mounted the swift chariot, and with one hand she took 
<A NAME="941"></A>the reins, and with the other the whip of cunning workmanship, to drive 
<A NAME="942"></A>the mules; and they rushed hasting to the city and the palace.  And when 
<A NAME="943"></A>she was come Chalciope in grief for her sons questioned her; but Medea, 
<A NAME="944"></A>distraught by swiftly-changing thoughts, neither heard her words nor was 
<A NAME="945"></A>eager to speak in answer to her questions.  But she sat upon a low stool 
<A NAME="946"></A>at the foot of her couch, bending down, her cheek leaning on her left hand, 
<A NAME="947"></A>and her eyes were wet with tears as she pondered what an evil deed she 
<A NAME="948"></A>had taken part in by her counsels.
<A NAME="949"></A><BR><BR>Now when Aeson's son had joined his comrades again in the spot 
<A NAME="950"></A>where he had left them when he departed, he set out to go with them, telling 
<A NAME="951"></A>them all the story, to the gathering of the heroes; and together they approached 
<A NAME="952"></A>the ship.  And when they saw Jason they embraced him and questioned him. 
<A NAME="953"></A> And he told to all the counsels of the maiden and showed the dread charm; 
<A NAME="954"></A>but Idas alone of his comrades sat apart biting down his wrath; and the 
<A NAME="955"></A>rest joyous in heart, at the hour when the darkness of night stayed them, 
<A NAME="956"></A>peacefully took thought for themselves.  But at daybreak they sent two 
<A NAME="957"></A>men to go to Aeetes and ask for the seed, first Telamon himself, dear to 
<A NAME="958"></A>Ares, and with him Aethalides, Hermes' famous son.  So they went and made 
<A NAME="959"></A>no vain journey; but when they came, lordly Aeetes gave them for the contest 
<A NAME="960"></A>the fell teeth of the Aonian dragon which Cadmus found in Ogygian Thebes 
<A NAME="961"></A>when he came seeking for Europa and there slew the--warder of the spring 
<A NAME="962"></A>of Ares.  There he settled by the guidance of the heifer whom Apollo by 
<A NAME="963"></A>his prophetic word granted him to lead him on his way.  But the teeth the 
<A NAME="964"></A>Tritonian goddess tore away from the dragon's jaws and bestowed as a gift 
<A NAME="965"></A>upon Aeetes and the slayer.  And Agenor's son, Cadmus, sowed them on the 
<A NAME="966"></A>Aonian plains and founded an earthborn people of all who were left from 
<A NAME="967"></A>the spear when Ares did the reaping; and the teeth Aeetes then readily 
<A NAME="968"></A>gave to be borne to the ship, for he deemed not that Jason would bring 
<A NAME="969"></A>the contest to an end, even though he should cast the yoke upon the 
<A NAME="970"></A>oxen.
<A NAME="971"></A><BR><BR>Far away in the west the sun was sailing beneath the dark earth, 
<A NAME="972"></A>beyond the furthest hills of the Aethiopians; and Night was laying the 
<A NAME="973"></A>yoke upon her steeds; and the heroes were preparing their beds by the hawsers. 
<A NAME="974"></A> But Jason, as soon as the stars of Heliee, the bright-gleaming bear, had 
<A NAME="975"></A>set, and the air had all grown still under heaven, went to a desert spot, 
<A NAME="976"></A>like some stealthy thief, with all that was needful; for beforehand in 
<A NAME="977"></A>the daytime had he taken thought for everything; and Argus came bringing 
<A NAME="978"></A>a ewe and milk from the flock; and them he took from the ship.  But when 
<A NAME="979"></A>the hero saw a place which was far away from the tread of men, in a clear 
<A NAME="980"></A>meadow beneath the open sky, there first of all he bathed his tender body 
<A NAME="981"></A>reverently in the sacred river; and round him he placed a dark robe, which 
<A NAME="982"></A>Hypsipyle of Lemnos had given him aforetime, a memorial of many a loving 
<A NAME="983"></A>embrace. Then he dug a pit in the ground of a cubit's depth and heaped 
<A NAME="984"></A>up billets of wood, and over it he cut the throat of the sheep, and duly 
<A NAME="985"></A>placed the carcase above; and he kindled the logs placing fire beneath, 
<A NAME="986"></A>and poured over them mingled libations, calling on Hecate Brimo to aid 
<A NAME="987"></A>him in the contests.  And when he had called on her he drew back; and she 
<A NAME="988"></A>heard him, the dread goddess, from the uttermost depths and came to the 
<A NAME="989"></A>sacrifice of Aeson's son; and round her horrible serpents twined themselves 
<A NAME="990"></A>among the oak boughs; and there was a gleam of countless torches; and sharply 
<A NAME="991"></A>howled around her the hounds of hell.  All the meadows trembled at her 
<A NAME="992"></A>step; and the nymphs that haunt the marsh and the river shrieked, all who 
<A NAME="993"></A>dance round that mead of Amarantian Phasis. And fear seized Aeson's son, 
<A NAME="994"></A>but not even so did he turn round as his feet bore him forth, till he came 
<A NAME="995"></A>back to his comrades; and now early dawn arose and shed her light above 
<A NAME="996"></A>snowy Caucasus.
<A NAME="997"></A><BR><BR>Then Aeetes arrayed his breast in the stiff corslet which Ares 
<A NAME="998"></A>gave him when he had slain Phlegraean Mimas with his own hands; and upon 
<A NAME="999"></A>his head he placed a golden helmet with four plumes, gleaming like the 
<A NAME="1000"></A>sun's round light when he first rises from Ocean.  And he wielded his shield 
<A NAME="1001"></A>of many hides, and his spear, terrible, resistless; none of the heroes 
<A NAME="1002"></A>could have withstood its shock now that they had left behind Heracles far 
<A NAME="1003"></A>away, who alone could have met it in battle.  For the king his well-fashioned 
<A NAME="1004"></A>chariot of swift steeds was held near at hand by Phaethon, for him to mount; 
<A NAME="1005"></A>and he mounted, and held the reins in his hands.  Then from the city he 
<A NAME="1006"></A>drove along the broad highway, that he might be present at the contest; 
<A NAME="1007"></A>and with him a countless multitude rushed forth.  And as Poseidon rides, 
<A NAME="1008"></A>mounted in his chariot, to the Isthmian contest or to Taenarus, or to Lerna's 
<A NAME="1009"></A>water, or through the grove of Hyantian Onchestus, and thereafter passes 
<A NAME="1010"></A>even to Calaureia with his steeds, and the Haemonian rock, or well-wooded 
<A NAME="1011"></A>Geraestus; even so was Aeetes, lord of the Colchians, to 
<A NAME="1012"></A>behold.
<A NAME="1013"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile, prompted by Medea, Jason steeped the charm in water 
<A NAME="1014"></A>and sprinkled with it his shield and sturdy spear, and sword; and his comrades 
<A NAME="1015"></A>round him made proof of his weapons with might and main, but could not 
<A NAME="1016"></A>bend that spear even a little, but it remained firm in their stalwart hands 
<A NAME="1017"></A>unbroken as before. But in furious rage with them Idas, Aphareus' son, 
<A NAME="1018"></A>with his great sword hewed at the spear near the butt, and the edge leapt 
<A NAME="1019"></A>back repelled by the shock, like a hammer from the anvil; and the heroes 
<A NAME="1020"></A>shouted with joy for their hope in the contest.  And then he sprinkled 
<A NAME="1021"></A>his body, and terrible prowess entered into him, unspeakable, dauntless; 
<A NAME="1022"></A>and his hands on both sides thrilled vigorously as they swelled with strength. 
<A NAME="1023"></A> And as when a warlike steed eager for the fight neighs and beats the ground 
<A NAME="1024"></A>with his hoof, while rejoicing he lifts his neck on high with ears erect; 
<A NAME="1025"></A>in such wise did Aeson's son rejoice in the strength of his limbs.  And 
<A NAME="1026"></A>often hither and thither did he leap high in air tossing in his hands his 
<A NAME="1027"></A>shield of bronze and ashen spear.  Thou wouldst say that wintry lightning 
<A NAME="1028"></A>flashing from the gloomy sky kept on darting forth from the clouds what 
<A NAME="1029"></A>time they bring with them their blackest rainstorm.  Not long after that 
<A NAME="1030"></A>were the heroes to hold back from the contests; but sitting in rows on 
<A NAME="1031"></A>their benches they sped swiftly on to the plain of Ares.  And it lay in 
<A NAME="1032"></A>front of them on the opposite side of the city, as far off as is the turning-post 
<A NAME="1033"></A>that a chariot must reach from the starting-point, when the kinsmen of 
<A NAME="1034"></A>a dead king appoint funeral games for footmen and horsemen.  And they found 
<A NAME="1035"></A>Aeetes and the tribes of the Colchians; these were stationed on the Caucasian 
<A NAME="1036"></A>heights, but the king by the winding brink of the river.
<A NAME="1037"></A><BR><BR>Now Aeson's son, as soon as his comrades had made the hawsers fast, 
<A NAME="1038"></A>leapt from the ship, and with spear and shield came forth to the contest; 
<A NAME="1039"></A>and at the same time he took the gleaming helmet of bronze filled with 
<A NAME="1040"></A>sharp teeth, and his sword girt round his shoulders, his body stripped, 
<A NAME="1041"></A>in somewise resembling Ares and in somewise Apollo of the golden sword. 
<A NAME="1042"></A> And gazing over the field he saw the bulls' yoke of bronze and near it 
<A NAME="1043"></A>the plough, all of one piece, of stubborn adamant.  Then he came near, 
<A NAME="1044"></A>and fixed his sturdy spear upright on its butt, and taking his helmet, 
<A NAME="1045"></A>off leant it against the spear.  And he went forward with shield alone 
<A NAME="1046"></A>to examine the countless tracks of the bulls, and they from some unseen 
<A NAME="1047"></A>lair beneath the earth, where was their strong steading, wrapt in murky 
<A NAME="1048"></A>smoke, both rushed out together, breathing forth flaming fire.  And sore 
<A NAME="1049"></A>afraid were the heroes at the sight.  But Jason, setting wide his feet, 
<A NAME="1050"></A>withstood their onset, as in the sea a rocky reef withstands the waves 
<A NAME="1051"></A>tossed by the countless blasts.  Then in front of him he held his shield; 
<A NAME="1052"></A>and both the bulls with loud bellowing attacked him with their mighty horns; 
<A NAME="1053"></A>nor did they stir him a jot by their onset. And as when through the holes 
<A NAME="1054"></A>of the furnace the armourers' bellows anon gleam brightly, kindling the 
<A NAME="1055"></A>ravening flame, and anon cease from blowing, and a terrible roar rises 
<A NAME="1056"></A>from the fire when it darts up from below; so the bulls roared, breathing 
<A NAME="1057"></A>forth swift flame from their mouths, while the consuming heat played round 
<A NAME="1058"></A>him, smiting like lightning; but the maiden's charms protected him.  Then 
<A NAME="1059"></A>grasping the tip of the horn of the right- hand bull, he dragged it mightily 
<A NAME="1060"></A>with all his strength to bring it near the yoke of bronze, and forced it 
<A NAME="1061"></A>down on to its knees, suddenly striking with his foot the foot of bronze. 
<A NAME="1062"></A> So also he threw the other bull on to its knees as it rushed upon him, 
<A NAME="1063"></A>and smote it down with one blow.  And throwing to the ground his broad 
<A NAME="1064"></A>shield, he held them both down where they had fallen on their fore-knees, 
<A NAME="1065"></A>as he strode from side to side, now here, now there, and rushed swiftly 
<A NAME="1066"></A>through the flame.  But Aeetes marvelled at the hero's might.  And meantime 
<A NAME="1067"></A>the sons of Tyndareus   for long since had it been thus ordained for them 
<A NAME="1068"></A>-- near at hand gave him the yoke from the ground to cast round them. 
<A NAME="1069"></A> Then tightly did he bind their necks; and lifting the pole of bronze between 
<A NAME="1070"></A>them, he fastened it to the yoke by its golden tip.  So the twin heroes 
<A NAME="1071"></A>started back from the fire to the ship. But Jason took up again his shield 
<A NAME="1072"></A>and cast it on his back behind him, and grasped the strong helmet filled 
<A NAME="1073"></A>with sharp teeth, and his resistless spear, wherewith, like some ploughman 
<A NAME="1074"></A>with a Pelasgian goad, he pricked the bulls beneath, striking their flanks; 
<A NAME="1075"></A>and very firmly did he guide the well fitted plough handle, fashioned of 
<A NAME="1076"></A>adamant.
<A NAME="1077"></A><BR><BR>The bulls meantime raged exceedingly, breathing forth furious flame 
<A NAME="1078"></A>of fire; and their breath rose up like the roar of blustering winds, in 
<A NAME="1079"></A>fear of which above all seafaring men furl their large sail.  But not long 
<A NAME="1080"></A>after that they moved on at the bidding of the spear; and behind them the 
<A NAME="1081"></A>rugged fallow was broken up, cloven by the might of the bulls and the sturdy 
<A NAME="1082"></A>ploughman.  Then terribly groaned the clods withal along the furrows of 
<A NAME="1083"></A>the plough as they were rent, each a man's burden; and Jason followed, 
<A NAME="1084"></A>pressing down the cornfield with firm foot; and far from him he ever sowed 
<A NAME="1085"></A>the teeth along the clods as each was ploughed, turning his head back for 
<A NAME="1086"></A>fear lest the deadly crop of earthborn men should rise against him first; 
<A NAME="1087"></A>and the bulls toiled onwards treading with their hoofs of 
<A NAME="1088"></A>bronze.
<A NAME="1089"></A><BR><BR>But when the third part of the day was still left as it wanes from 
<A NAME="1090"></A>dawn, and wearied labourers call for the sweet hour of unyoking to come 
<A NAME="1091"></A>to them straightway, then the fallow was ploughed by the tireless ploughman, 
<A NAME="1092"></A>four plough-gates though it was; and he loosed the plough from the oxen. 
<A NAME="1093"></A> Them he scared in flight towards the plain; but he went back again to 
<A NAME="1094"></A>the ship, while he still saw the furrows free of the earthborn men. And 
<A NAME="1095"></A>all round his comrades heartened him with their shouts.  And in the helmet 
<A NAME="1096"></A>he drew from the river's stream and quenched his thirst with the water. 
<A NAME="1097"></A> Then he bent his knees till they grew supple, and filled his mighty heart 
<A NAME="1098"></A>with courage, raging like a boar, when it sharpens its teeth against the 
<A NAME="1099"></A>hunters, while from its wrathful mouth plenteous foam drips to the ground. 
<A NAME="1100"></A> By now the earthborn men were springing up over all the field; and the 
<A NAME="1101"></A>plot of Ares, the death-dealer, bristled with sturdy shields and double-pointed 
<A NAME="1102"></A>spears and shining helmets; and the gleam reached Olympus from beneath, 
<A NAME="1103"></A>flashing through the air.  And as when abundant snow has fallen on the 
<A NAME="1104"></A>earth and the storm blasts have dispersed the wintry clouds under the m
