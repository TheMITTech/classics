<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Here were the oxstalls and farm of Amycus, the haughty king of the Bebrycians, 
<A NAME="11"></A>whom once a nymph, Bithynian Melie, united to Poseidon Genethlius, bare 
<A NAME="12"></A>the most arrogant of men; for even for strangers he laid down an insulting 
<A NAME="13"></A>ordinance, that none should depart till they had made trial of him in boxing; 
<A NAME="14"></A>and he had slain many of the neighbours.  And at that time too he went 
<A NAME="15"></A>down to the ship and in his insolence scorned to ask them the occasion 
<A NAME="16"></A>of their voyage, and who they were, but at once spake out among them 
<A NAME="17"></A>all:
<A NAME="18"></A><BR><BR>"Listen, ye wanderers by sea, to what it befits you to know.  It 
<A NAME="19"></A>is the rule that no stranger who comes to the Bebrycians should depart 
<A NAME="20"></A>till he has raised his hands in battle against mine.  Wherefore select 
<A NAME="21"></A>your bravest warrior from the host and set him here on the spot to contend 
<A NAME="22"></A>with me in boxing. But if ye pay no heed and trample my decrees under foot, 
<A NAME="23"></A>assuredly to your sorrow will stern necessity come upon 
<A NAME="24"></A>you.
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spake in his pride, but fierce anger seized them when they 
<A NAME="26"></A>heard it, and the challenge smote Polydeuces most of all.  And quickly 
<A NAME="27"></A>he stood forth his comrades' champion, and cried:
<A NAME="28"></A><BR><BR>"Hold now, and display not to us thy brutal violence, whoever thou 
<A NAME="29"></A>art; for we will obey thy rules, as thou sayest.  Willingly now do I myself 
<A NAME="30"></A>undertake to meet thee."
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spake outright; but the other with rolling eyes glared 
<A NAME="32"></A>on him, like to a lion struck by a javelin when hunters in the mountains 
<A NAME="33"></A>are hemming him round, and, though pressed by the throng, he reeks no more 
<A NAME="34"></A>of them, but keeps his eyes fixed, singling out that man only who struck 
<A NAME="35"></A>him first and slew him not.  Hereupon the son of Tyndareus laid aside his 
<A NAME="36"></A>mantle, closely-woven, delicately-wrought, which one of the Lemnian maidens 
<A NAME="37"></A>had given him as a pledge of hospitality; and the king threw down his dark 
<A NAME="38"></A>cloak of double fold with its clasps and the knotted crook of mountain 
<A NAME="39"></A>olive which he carried.  Then straightway they looked and chose close by 
<A NAME="40"></A>a spot that pleased them and bade their comrades sit upon the sand in two 
<A NAME="41"></A>lines; nor were they alike to behold in form or in stature.  The one seemed 
<A NAME="42"></A>to be a monstrous son of baleful Typhoeus or of Earth herself, such as 
<A NAME="43"></A>she brought forth aforetime, in her wrath against Zeus; but the other, 
<A NAME="44"></A>the son of Tyndareus, was like a star of heaven, whose beams are fairest 
<A NAME="45"></A>as it shines through the nightly sky at eventide.  Such was the son of 
<A NAME="46"></A>Zeus, the bloom of the first down still on his cheeks, still with the look 
<A NAME="47"></A>of gladness in his eyes. But his might and fury waxed like a wild beast's; 
<A NAME="48"></A>and he poised his hands to see if they were pliant as before and were not 
<A NAME="49"></A>altogether numbed by toil and rowing.  But Amycus on his side made no trial; 
<A NAME="50"></A>but standing apart in silence he kept his eyes upon his foe, and his spirit 
<A NAME="51"></A>surged within him all eager to dash the life-blood from his breast.  And 
<A NAME="52"></A>between them Lyeoreus, the henchman of Amycus, placed at their feet on 
<A NAME="53"></A>each side two pairs of gauntlets made of raw hide, dry, exceeding tough. 
<A NAME="54"></A> And the king addressed the hero with arrogant words:
<A NAME="55"></A><BR><BR>"Whichever of these thou wilt, without casting lots, I grant thee 
<A NAME="56"></A>freely, that thou mayst not blame me hereafter. Bind them about thy hands; 
<A NAME="57"></A>thou shalt learn and tell another how skilled I am to carve the dry oxhides 
<A NAME="58"></A>and to spatter men's cheeks with blood."
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spake; but the other gave back no taunt in answer, but 
<A NAME="60"></A>with a light smile readily took up the gauntlets that lay at his feet; 
<A NAME="61"></A>and to him came Castor and mighty Talaus, son of Bias, and they quickly 
<A NAME="62"></A>bound the gauntlets about his hands, often bidding him be of good courage. 
<A NAME="63"></A> And to Amycus came Aretus and Ornytus, but little they knew, poor fools, 
<A NAME="64"></A>that they had bound them for the last time on their champion, a victim 
<A NAME="65"></A>of evil fate.
<A NAME="66"></A><BR><BR>Now when they stood apart and were ready with their gauntlets, 
<A NAME="67"></A>straightway in front of their faces they raised their heavy hands and matched 
<A NAME="68"></A>their might in deadly strife.  Hereupon the Bebrycian king even as a fierce 
<A NAME="69"></A>wave of the sea rises in a crest against a swift ship, but she by the skill 
<A NAME="70"></A>of the crafty pilot just escapes the shock when the billow is eager to 
<A NAME="71"></A>break over the bulwark--so he followed up the son of Tyndareus, trying 
<A NAME="72"></A>to daunt him, and gave him no respite.  But the hero, ever unwounded, by 
<A NAME="73"></A>his skill baffled the rush of his foe, and he quickly noted the brutal 
<A NAME="74"></A>play of his fists to see where he was invincible in strength, and where 
<A NAME="75"></A>inferior, and stood unceasingly and returned blow for blow.  And as when 
<A NAME="76"></A>shipwrights with their hammers smite ships' timbers to meet the sharp clamps, 
<A NAME="77"></A>fixing layer upon layer; and the blows resound one after another; so cheeks 
<A NAME="78"></A>and jaws crashed on both sides, and a huge clattering of teeth arose, nor 
<A NAME="79"></A>did they cease ever from striking their blows until laboured gasping overcame 
<A NAME="80"></A>both.  And standing a little apart they wiped from their foreheads sweat 
<A NAME="81"></A>in abundance, wearily panting for breath.  Then back they rushed together 
<A NAME="82"></A>again, as two bulls fight in furious rivalry for a grazing heifer.  Next 
<A NAME="83"></A>Amycus rising on tiptoe, like one who slays an ox, sprung to his full height 
<A NAME="84"></A>and swung his heavy hand down upon his rival; but the hero swerved aside 
<A NAME="85"></A>from the rush, turning his head, and just received the arm on his shoulder; 
<A NAME="86"></A>and coming near and slipping his knee past the king's, with a rush he struck 
<A NAME="87"></A>him above the ear, and broke the bones inside, and the king in agony fell 
<A NAME="88"></A>upon his knees; and the Minyan heroes shouted for joy; and his life was 
<A NAME="89"></A>poured forth all at once.
<A NAME="90"></A><BR><BR>Nor were the Bebrycians reckless of their king; but all together 
<A NAME="91"></A>took up rough clubs and spears and rushed straight on Polydeuces.  But 
<A NAME="92"></A>in front of him stood his comrades, their keen swords drawn from the sheath. 
<A NAME="93"></A> First Castor struck upon the head a man as he rushed at him: and it was 
<A NAME="94"></A>cleft in twain and fell on each side upon his shoulders.  And Polydeuces 
<A NAME="95"></A>slew huge Itymoneus and Mimas.  The one, with a sudden leap, he smote beneath 
<A NAME="96"></A>the breast with his swift foot and threw him in the dust; and as the other 
<A NAME="97"></A>drew near he struck him with his right hand above the left eyebrow, and 
<A NAME="98"></A>tore away his eyelid and the eyeball was left bare.  But Oreides, insolent 
<A NAME="99"></A>henchman of Amycus, wounded Talaus son of Bias in the side, but did not 
<A NAME="100"></A>slay him, but only grazing the skin the bronze sped under his belt and 
<A NAME="101"></A>touched not the flesh.  Likewise Aretus with well-seasoned club smote Iphitus, 
<A NAME="102"></A>the steadfast son of Eurytus, not yet destined to an evil death; assuredly 
<A NAME="103"></A>soon was he himself to be slain by the sword of Clytius.  Then Ancaeus, 
<A NAME="104"></A>the dauntless son of Lycurgus, quickly seized his huge axe, and in his 
<A NAME="105"></A>left hand holding a bear's dark hide, plunged into the midst of the Bebrycians 
<A NAME="106"></A>with furious onset; and with him charged the sons of Aeacus, and with them 
<A NAME="107"></A>started warlike Jason.  And as when amid the folds grey wolves rush down 
<A NAME="108"></A>on a winter's day and scare countless sheep, unmarked by the keen-scented 
<A NAME="109"></A>dogs and the shepherds too, and they seek what first to attack and carry 
<A NAME="110"></A>off; often glaring around, but the sheep are just huddled together and 
<A NAME="111"></A>trample on one another; so the heroes grievously scared the arrogant Bebrycians. 
<A NAME="112"></A>And as shepherds or beekeepers smoke out a huge swarm of bees in a rock, 
<A NAME="113"></A>and they meanwhile, pent up in their hive, murmur with droning hum, till, 
<A NAME="114"></A>stupefied by the murky smoke, they fly forth far from the rock; so they 
<A NAME="115"></A>stayed steadfast no longer, but scattered themselves inland through Bebrycia, 
<A NAME="116"></A>proclaiming the death of Amycus; fools, not to perceive that another woe 
<A NAME="117"></A>all unforeseen was hard upon them.  For at that hour their vineyards and 
<A NAME="118"></A>villages were being ravaged by the hostile spear of Lycus and the Mariandyni, 
<A NAME="119"></A>now that their king was gone.  For they were ever at strife about the ironbearing 
<A NAME="120"></A>land.  And now the foe was destroying their steadings and farms, and now 
<A NAME="121"></A>the heroes from all sides were driving off their countless sheep, and one 
<A NAME="122"></A>spake among his fellows thus:
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>"Bethink ye what they would have done in their cowardice if haply 
<A NAME="124"></A>some god had brought Heracles hither. Assuredly, if he had been here, no 
<A NAME="125"></A>trial would there have been of fists, I ween, but when the king drew near 
<A NAME="126"></A>to proclaim his rules, the club would have made him forget his pride and 
<A NAME="127"></A>the rules to boot.  Yea, we left him uncared for on the strand and we sailed 
<A NAME="128"></A>oversea; and full well each one of us shall know our baneful folly, now 
<A NAME="129"></A>that he is far away."
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spake, but all these things had been wrought by the counsels 
<A NAME="131"></A>of Zeus.  Then they remained there through the night and tended the hurts 
<A NAME="132"></A>of the wounded men, and offered sacrifice to the immortals, and made ready 
<A NAME="133"></A>a mighty meal; and sleep fell upon no man beside the bowl and the blazing 
<A NAME="134"></A>sacrifice.  They wreathed their fair brows with the bay that grew by the 
<A NAME="135"></A>shore, whereto their hawsers were bound, and chanted a song to the lyre 
<A NAME="136"></A>of Orpheus in sweet harmony; and the windless shore was charmed by their 
<A NAME="137"></A>song; and they celebrated the Therapnaean son of Zeus.
<A NAME="138"></A><BR><BR>But when the sun rising from far lands lighted up the dewy hills 
<A NAME="139"></A>and wakened the shepherds, then they loosed their hawsers from the stem 
<A NAME="140"></A>of the baytree and put on board all the spoil they had need to take; and 
<A NAME="141"></A>with a favouring wind they steered through the eddying Bosporus.  Hereupon 
<A NAME="142"></A>a wave like a steep mountain rose aloft in front as though rushing upon 
<A NAME="143"></A>them, ever upheaved above the clouds; nor would you say that they could 
<A NAME="144"></A>escape grim death, for in its fury it hangs over the middle of the ship, 
<A NAME="145"></A>like a cloud, yet it sinks away into calm if it meets with a skilful helmsman. 
<A NAME="146"></A> So they by the steering-craft of Tiphys escaped, unhurt but sore dismayed. 
<A NAME="147"></A> And on the next day they fastened the hawsers to the coast opposite the 
<A NAME="148"></A>Bithynian land.
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR>There Phineus, son of Agenor, had his home by the sea, Phineus 
<A NAME="150"></A>who above all men endured most bitter woes because of the gift of prophecy 
<A NAME="151"></A>which Leto's son had granted him aforetime.  And he reverenced not a whit 
<A NAME="152"></A>even Zeus himself, for he foretold unerringly to men his sacred will. 
<A NAME="153"></A> Wherefore Zeus sent upon him a lingering old age, and took from his eyes 
<A NAME="154"></A>the pleasant light, and suffered him not to have joy of the dainties untold 
<A NAME="155"></A>that the dwellers around ever brought to his house, when they came to enquire 
<A NAME="156"></A>the will of heaven.  But on a sudden, swooping through the clouds, the 
<A NAME="157"></A>Harpies with their crooked beaks incessantly snatched the food away from 
<A NAME="158"></A>his mouth and hands.  And at times not a morsel of food was left, at others 
<A NAME="159"></A>but a little, in order that he might live and be tormented.  And they poured 
<A NAME="160"></A>forth over all a loathsome stench; and no one dared not merely to carry 
<A NAME="161"></A>food to his mouth but even to stand at a distance; so foully reeked the 
<A NAME="162"></A>remnants of the meal.  But straightway when he heard the voice and the 
<A NAME="163"></A>tramp of the band he knew that they were the men passing by, at whose coming 
<A NAME="164"></A>Zeus' oracle had declared to him that he should have joy of his food. 
<A NAME="165"></A> And he rose from his couch, like a lifeless dream, bowed over his staff, 
<A NAME="166"></A>and crept to the door on his withered feet, feeling the walls; and as he 
<A NAME="167"></A>moved, his limbs trembled for weakness and age; and his parched skin was 
<A NAME="168"></A>caked with dirt, and naught but the skill held his bones together.  And 
<A NAME="169"></A>he came forth from the hall with wearied knees and sat on the threshold 
<A NAME="170"></A>of the courtyard; and a dark stupor covered him, and it seemed that the 
<A NAME="171"></A>earth reeled round beneath his feet, and he lay in a strengthless trance, 
<A NAME="172"></A>speechless.  But when they saw him they gathered round and marvelled. 
<A NAME="173"></A> And he at last drew laboured breath from the depths of his chest and spoke 
<A NAME="174"></A>among them with prophetic utterance:
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR>"Listen, bravest of all the Hellenes, if it be truly ye, whom by 
<A NAME="176"></A>a king's ruthless command Jason is leading on the ship Argo in quest of 
<A NAME="177"></A>the fleece.  It is ye truly.  Even yet my soul by its divination knows 
<A NAME="178"></A>everything.  Thanks I render to thee, O king, son of Leto, plunged in bitter 
<A NAME="179"></A>affliction though I be.  I beseech you by Zeus the god of suppliants, the 
<A NAME="180"></A>sternest foe to sinful men, and for the sake of Phoebus and Hera herself, 
<A NAME="181"></A>under whose especial care ye have come hither, help me, save an ill-fated 
<A NAME="182"></A>man from misery, and depart not uncaring and leaving me thus as ye see. 
<A NAME="183"></A> For not only has the Fury set her foot on my eyes and I drag on to the 
<A NAME="184"></A>end a weary old age; but besides my other woes a woe hangs over me the 
<A NAME="185"></A>bitterest of all.  The Harpies, swooping down from some unseen den of destruction, 
<A NAME="186"></A>ever snatch the food from my mouth.  And I have no device to aid me. But 
<A NAME="187"></A>it were easier, when I long for a meal, to escape my own thoughts than 
<A NAME="188"></A>them, so swiftly do they fly through the air.  But if haply they do leave 
<A NAME="189"></A>me a morsel of food it reeks of decay and the stench is unendurable, nor 
<A NAME="190"></A>could any mortal bear to draw near even for a moment, no, not if his heart 
<A NAME="191"></A>were wrought of adamant. But necessity, bitter and insatiate, compels me 
<A NAME="192"></A>to abide and abiding to put food in my cursed belly.  These pests, the 
<A NAME="193"></A>oracle declares, the sons of Boreas shall restrain.  And no strangers are 
<A NAME="194"></A>they that shall ward them off if indeed I am Phineus who was once renowned 
<A NAME="195"></A>among men for wealth and the gift of prophecy, and if I am the son of my 
<A NAME="196"></A>father Agenor; and, when I ruled among the Thracians, by my bridal gifts 
<A NAME="197"></A>I brought home their sister Cleopatra to be my wife."
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR>So spake Agenor's son; and deep sorrow seized each of the heroes, 
<A NAME="199"></A>and especially the two sons of Boreas.  And brushing away a tear they drew 
<A NAME="200"></A>nigh, and Zetes spake as follows, taking in his own the hand of the grief-worn 
<A NAME="201"></A>sire:
<A NAME="202"></A><BR><BR>"Unhappy one, none other of men is more wretched than thou, methinks. 
<A NAME="203"></A> Why upon thee is laid the burden of so many sorrows?  Hast thou with baneful 
<A NAME="204"></A>folly sinned against the gods through thy skill in prophecy?  For this 
<A NAME="205"></A>are they greatly wroth with thee?  Yet our spirit is dismayed within us 
<A NAME="206"></A>for all our desire to aid thee, if indeed the god has granted this privilege 
<A NAME="207"></A>to us two.  For plain to discern to men of earth are the reproofs of the 
<A NAME="208"></A>immortals.  And we will never check the Harpies when they come, for all 
<A NAME="209"></A>our desire, until thou hast sworn that for this we shall not lose the favour 
<A NAME="210"></A>of heaven."
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spake; and towards him the aged sire opened his sightless 
<A NAME="212"></A>eyes, and lifted them up and replied with these words:
<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR>"Be silent, store not up such thoughts in thy heart, my child. 
<A NAME="214"></A> Let the son of Leto be my witness, he who of his gracious will taught 
<A NAME="215"></A>me the lore of prophecy, and be witness the ill-starred doom which possesses 
<A NAME="216"></A>me and this dark cloud upon my eyes, and the gods of the underworld--and 
<A NAME="217"></A>may their curse be upon me if I die perjured thus--no wrath from heaven 
<A NAME="218"></A>will fall upon you two for your help to me."
<A NAME="219"></A><BR><BR>Then were those two eager to help him because of the oath.  And 
<A NAME="220"></A>quickly the younger heroes prepared a feast for the aged man, a last prey 
<A NAME="221"></A>for the Harpies; and both stood near him, to smite with the sword those 
<A NAME="222"></A>pests when they swooped down. Scarcely had the aged man touched the food 
<A NAME="223"></A>when they forthwith, like bitter blasts or flashes of lightning, suddenly 
<A NAME="224"></A>darted from the clouds, and swooped down with a yell, fiercely craving 
<A NAME="225"></A>for food; and the heroes beheld them and shouted in the midst of their 
<A NAME="226"></A>onrush; but they at the cry devoured everything and sped away over the 
<A NAME="227"></A>sea after; and an intolerable stench remained.  And behind them the two 
<A NAME="228"></A>sons of Boreas raising their swords rushed in pursuit.  For Zeus imparted 
<A NAME="229"></A>to them tireless strength; but without Zeus they could not have followed, 
<A NAME="230"></A>for the Harpies used ever to outstrip the blasts of the west wind when 
<A NAME="231"></A>they came to Phineus and when they left him.  And as when, upon the mountain- 
<A NAME="232"></A>side, hounds, cunning in the chase, run in the track of horned goats or 
<A NAME="233"></A>deer, and as they strain a little behind gnash their teeth upon the edge 
<A NAME="234"></A>of their jaws in vain; so Zetes and Calais rushing very near just grazed 
<A NAME="235"></A>the Harpies in vain with their finger-tips.  And assuredly they would have 
<A NAME="236"></A>torn them to pieces, despite heaven's will, when they had overtaken them 
<A NAME="237"></A>far off at the Floating Islands, had not swift Iris seen them and leapt 
<A NAME="238"></A>down from the sky from heaven above, and cheeked them with these 
<A NAME="239"></A>words:
<A NAME="240"></A><BR><BR>"It is not lawful, O sons of Boreas, to strike with your swords 
<A NAME="241"></A>the Harpies, the hounds of mighty Zeus; but I myself will give you a pledge, 
<A NAME="242"></A>that hereafter they shall not draw near to Phineus."
<A NAME="243"></A><BR><BR>With these words she took an oath by the waters of Styx, which 
<A NAME="244"></A>to all the gods is most dread and most awful, that the Harpies would never 
<A NAME="245"></A>thereafter again approach the home of Phineus, son of Agenor, for so it 
<A NAME="246"></A>was fated.  And the heroes yielding to the oath, turned back their flight 
<A NAME="247"></A>to the ship.  And on account of this men call them the Islands of Turning 
<A NAME="248"></A>though aforetime they called them the Floating Islands.  And the Harpies 
<A NAME="249"></A>and Iris parted.  They entered their den in Minoan Crete; but she sped 
<A NAME="250"></A>up to Olympus, soaring aloft on her swift wings.
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the chiefs carefully cleansed the old man's squalid skin 
<A NAME="252"></A>and with due selection sacrificed sheep which they had borne away from 
<A NAME="253"></A>the spoil of Amycus.  And when they had laid a huge supper in the hall, 
<A NAME="254"></A>they sat down and feasted, and with them feasted Phineus ravenously, delighting 
<A NAME="255"></A>his soul, as in a dream.  And there, when they had taken their fill of 
<A NAME="256"></A>food and drink, they kept awake all night waiting for the sons of Boreas. 
<A NAME="257"></A>And the aged sire himself sat in the midst, near the hearth, telling of 
<A NAME="258"></A>the end of their voyage and the completion of their 
<A NAME="259"></A>journey:
<A NAME="260"></A><BR><BR>"Listen then.  Not everything is it lawful for you to know clearly; 
<A NAME="261"></A>but whatever is heaven's will, I will not hide. I was infatuated aforetime, 
<A NAME="262"></A>when in my folly I declared the will of Zeus in order and to the end. 
<A NAME="263"></A> For he himself wishes to deliver to men the utterances of the prophetic 
<A NAME="264"></A>art incomplete, in order that they may still have some need to know the 
<A NAME="265"></A>will of heaven.
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR>"First of all, after leaving me, ye will see the twin Cyanean rocks 
<A NAME="267"></A>where the two seas meet.  No one, I ween, has won his escape between them. 
<A NAME="268"></A> For they are not firmly fixed with roots beneath, but constantly clash 
<A NAME="269"></A>against one another to one point, and above a huge mass of salt water rises 
<A NAME="270"></A>in a crest, boiling up, and loudly dashes upon the hard beach.  Wherefore 
<A NAME="271"></A>now obey my counsel, if indeed with prudent mind and reverencing the blessed 
<A NAME="272"></A>gods ye pursue your way; and perish not foolishly by a self-sought death, 
<A NAME="273"></A>or rush on following the guidance of youth. First entrust the attempt to 
<A NAME="274"></A>a dove when ye have sent her forth from the ship.  And if she escapes safe 
<A NAME="275"></A>with her wings between the rocks to the open sea, then no more do ye refrain 
<A NAME="276"></A>from the path, but grip your oars well in your hands and cleave the sea's 
<A NAME="277"></A>narrow strait, for the light of safety will be not so much in prayer as 
<A NAME="278"></A>in strength of hands.  Wherefore let all else go and labour boldly with 
<A NAME="279"></A>might and main, but ere then implore the gods as ye will, I forbid you 
<A NAME="280"></A>not.  But if she flies onward and perishes midway, then do ye turn back; 
<A NAME="281"></A>for it is better to yield to the immortals.  For ye could not escape an 
<A NAME="282"></A>evil doom from the rocks, not even if Argo were of iron.
<A NAME="283"></A><BR><BR>"O hapless ones, dare not to transgress my divine warning, even 
<A NAME="284"></A>though ye think that I am thrice as much hated by the sons of heaven as 
<A NAME="285"></A>I am, and even more than thrice; dare not to sail further with your ship 
<A NAME="286"></A>in despite of the omen.  And as these things will fall, so shall they fall. 
<A NAME="287"></A> But if ye shun the clashing rocks and come scatheless inside Pontus, straightway 
<A NAME="288"></A>keep the land of the Bithynians on your right and sail on, and beware of 
<A NAME="289"></A>the breakers, until ye round the swift river Rhebas and the black beach, 
<A NAME="290"></A>and reach the harbour of the Isle of Thynias. Thence ye must turn back 
<A NAME="291"></A>a little space through the sea and beach your ship on the land of the Mariandyni 
<A NAME="292"></A>lying opposite.  Here is a downward path to the abode of Hades, and the 
<A NAME="293"></A>headland of Acherusia stretches aloft, and eddying Acheron cleaves its 
<A NAME="294"></A>way at the bottom, even through the headland, and sends its waters forth 
<A NAME="295"></A>from a huge ravine.  And near it ye will sail past many hills of the Paphlagonians, 
<A NAME="296"></A>over whom at the first Eneteian Pelops reigned, and of his blood they boast 
<A NAME="297"></A>themselves to be.
<A NAME="298"></A><BR><BR>"Now there is a headland opposite Helice the Bear, steep on all 
<A NAME="299"></A>sides, and they call it Carambis, about whose crests the blasts of the 
<A NAME="300"></A>north wind are sundered.  So high in the air does it rise turned towards 
<A NAME="301"></A>the sea.  And when ye have rounded it broad Aegialus stretches before you; 
<A NAME="302"></A>and at the end of broad Aegialus, at a jutting point of coast, the waters 
<A NAME="303"></A>of the river Halys pour forth with a terrible roar; and after it his flowing 
<A NAME="304"></A>near, but smaller in stream, rolls into the sea with white eddies.  Onward 
<A NAME="305"></A>from thence the bend of a huge and towering cape reaches out from the land, 
<A NAME="306"></A>next Thermodon at its mouth flows into a quiet bay at the Themiscyreian 
<A NAME="307"></A>headland, after wandering through a broad continent.  And here is the plain 
<A NAME="308"></A>of Doeas, and near are the three cities of the Amazons, and after them 
<A NAME="309"></A>the Chalybes, most wretched of men, possess a soil rugged and unyielding 
<A NAME="310"></A>sons of toil, they busy themselves with working iron. And near them dwell 
<A NAME="311"></A>the Tibareni, rich in sheep, beyond the Genetaean headland of Zeus, lord 
<A NAME="312"></A>of hospitality.  And bordering on it the Mossynoeci next in order inhabit 
<A NAME="313"></A>the well-wooded mainland and the parts beneath the mountains, who have 
<A NAME="314"></A>built in towers made from trees their wooden homes and well-fitted chambers, 
<A NAME="315"></A>which they call Mossynes, and the people themselves take their name from 
<A NAME="316"></A>them.  After passing them ye must beach your ship upon a smooth island, 
<A NAME="317"></A>when ye have driven away with all manner of skill the ravening birds, which 
<A NAME="318"></A>in countless numbers haunt the desert island.  In it the Queens of the 
<A NAME="319"></A>Amazons, Otrere and Antiope, built a stone temple of Ares what time they 
<A NAME="320"></A>went forth to war.  Now here an unspeakable help will come to you from 
<A NAME="321"></A>the bitter sea; wherefore with kindly intent I bid you stay.  But what 
<A NAME="322"></A>need is there that I should sin yet again declaring everything to the end 
<A NAME="323"></A>by my prophetic art?  And beyond the island and opposite mainland dwell 
<A NAME="324"></A>the Philyres: and above the Philyres are the Macrones, and after them the 
<A NAME="325"></A>vast tribes of the Becheiri. And next in order to them dwell the Sapeires, 
<A NAME="326"></A>and the Byzeres have the lands adjoining to them, and beyond them at last 
<A NAME="327"></A>live the warlike Colchians themselves.  But speed on in your ship, till 
<A NAME="328"></A>ye touch the inmost bourne of the sea.  And here at the Cytaean mainland 
<A NAME="329"></A>and from the Amarantine mountains far away and the Circaean plain, eddying 
<A NAME="330"></A>Phasis rolls his broad stream to the sea.  Guide your ship to the mouth 
<A NAME="331"></A>of that river and ye shall behold the towers of Cytaean Aeetes and the 
<A NAME="332"></A>shady grove of Ares, where a dragon, a monster terrible to behold, ever 
<A NAME="333"></A>glares around, keeping watch over the fleece that is spread upon the top 
<A NAME="334"></A>of an oak; neither by day nor by night does sweet sleep subdue his restless 
<A NAME="335"></A>eyes."
<A NAME="336"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spake, and straightway fear seized them as they heard. 
<A NAME="337"></A> And for a long while they were struck with silence; till at last the hero, 
<A NAME="338"></A>son of Aeson, spake, sore dismayed at their evil plight:
<A NAME="339"></A><BR><BR>"O aged sire, now hast thou come to the end of the toils of our 
<A NAME="340"></A>sea-journeying and hast told us the token, trusting to which we shall make 
<A NAME="341"></A>our way to Pontus through the hateful rocks; but whether, when we have 
<A NAME="342"></A>escaped them, we shall have a return back again to Hellas, this too would 
<A NAME="343"></A>we gladly learn from thee.  What shall I do, how shall I go over again 
<A NAME="344"></A>such a long path through the sea, unskilled as I am, with unskilled comrades? 
<A NAME="345"></A>And Colchian Aea lies at the edge of Pontus and of the 
<A NAME="346"></A>world."
<A NAME="347"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spake, and him the aged sire addressed in reply: "O son, 
<A NAME="348"></A>when once thou hast escaped through the deadly rocks, fear not; for a deity 
<A NAME="349"></A>will be the guide from Aea by another track; and to Aea there will be guides 
<A NAME="350"></A>enough.  But, my friends, take thought of the artful aid of the Cyprian 
<A NAME="351"></A>goddess. For on her depends the glorious issue of your venture.  And further 
<A NAME="352"></A>than this ask me not."
<A NAME="353"></A><BR><BR>Thus spake Agenor's son, and close at hand the twin sons of Thracian 
<A NAME="354"></A>Boreas came darting from the sky and set their swift feet upon the threshold; 
<A NAME="355"></A>and the heroes rose up from their seats when they saw them present.  And 
<A NAME="356"></A>Zetes, still drawing hard breath after his toil, spake among the eager 
<A NAME="357"></A>listeners, telling them how far they had driven the Harpies and how his 
<A NAME="358"></A>prevented their slaying them, and how the goddess of her grace gave them 
<A NAME="359"></A>pledges, and how those others in fear plunged into the vast cave of the 
<A NAME="360"></A>Dictaean cliff.  Then in the mansion all their comrades were joyful at 
<A NAME="361"></A>the tidings and so was Phineus himself. And quickly Aeson's son, with good 
<A NAME="362"></A>will exceeding, addressed him:
<A NAME="363"></A><BR><BR>Assuredly there was then, Phineus, some god who cared for thy bitter 
<A NAME="364"></A>woe, and brought us hither from afar, that the sons of Boreas might aid 
<A NAME="365"></A>thee; and if too he should bring sight to thine eyes, verily I should rejoice, 
<A NAME="366"></A>methinks, as much as if I were on my homeward way."
<A NAME="367"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spake, but Phineus replied to him with downcast look: "Son 
<A NAME="368"></A>of Aeson, that is past recall, nor is there any remedy hereafter, for blasted 
<A NAME="369"></A>are my sightless eyes.  But instead of that, may the god grant me death 
<A NAME="370"></A>at once, and after death I shall take my share in perfect 
<A NAME="371"></A>bliss."
<A NAME="372"></A><BR><BR>Then they two returned answering speech, each to other, and soon 
<A NAME="373"></A>in the midst of their converse early dawn appeared; and round Phineus were 
<A NAME="374"></A>gathered the neighbours who used to come thither aforetime day by day and 
<A NAME="375"></A>constantly bring a portion of their food.  To all alike, however poor he 
<A NAME="376"></A>was that came, the aged man gave his oracles with good will, and freed 
<A NAME="377"></A>many from their woes by his prophetic art; wherefore they visited and tended 
<A NAME="378"></A>him.  And with them came Paraebius, who was dearest to him, and gladly 
<A NAME="379"></A>did he perceive these strangers in the house. For long ere now the seer 
<A NAME="380"></A>himself had said that a band of chieftains, faring from Hellas to the city 
<A NAME="381"></A>of Aceres, would make fast their hawsers to the Thynian land, and by Zeus' 
<A NAME="382"></A>will would check tho approach of the Harpies.  The rest the old man pleased 
<A NAME="383"></A>with words of wisdom and let them go; Paraebius only he bade remain there 
<A NAME="384"></A>with the chiefs; and straightway he sent him and bade him bring back the 
<A NAME="385"></A>choicest of his sheep.  And when he had left the hall Phineus spake gently 
<A NAME="386"></A>amid the throng of oarsmen:
<A NAME="387"></A><BR><BR>"O my friends, not all men are arrogant, it seems, nor unmindful 
<A NAME="388"></A>of benefits.  Even as this man, loyal as he is, came hither to learn his 
<A NAME="389"></A>fate.  For when he laboured the most and toiled the most, then the needs 
<A NAME="390"></A>of life, ever growing more and more, would waste him, and day after day 
<A NAME="391"></A>ever dawned more wretched, nor was there any respite to his toil.  But 
<A NAME="392"></A>he was paying the sad penalty of his father's sin.  For he when alone on 
<A NAME="393"></A>the mountains, felling trees, once slighted the prayers of a Hamadryad, 
<A NAME="394"></A>who wept and sought to soften him with plaintive words, not to cut down 
<A NAME="395"></A>the stump of an oak tree coeval with herself, wherein for a long time she 
<A NAME="396"></A>had lived continually; but he in the arrogance of youth recklessly cut 
<A NAME="397"></A>it down.  So to him the nymph thereafter made her death a curse, to him 
<A NAME="398"></A>and to his children.  I indeed knew of the sin when he came; and I bid 
<A NAME="399"></A>him build an altar to the Thynian nymph, and offer on it an atoning sacrifice, 
<A NAME="400"></A>with prayer to escape his father's fate.  Here, ever since he escaped the 
<A NAME="401"></A>god-sent doom, never has he forgotten or neglected me; but sorely and against 
<A NAME="402"></A>his will do I send him from my doors, so eager is he to remain with me 
<A NAME="403"></A>in my affliction."
<A NAME="404"></A><BR><BR>Thus spake Agenor's son; and his friend straightway came near leading 
<A NAME="405"></A>two sheep from the flock.  And up rose Jason and up rose the sons of Boreas 
<A NAME="406"></A>at the bidding of the aged sire . And quickly they called upon Apollo, 
<A NAME="407"></A>lord of prophecy, and offered sacrifice upon the health as the day was 
<A NAME="408"></A>just sinking.  And the younger comrades made ready a feast to their hearts' 
<A NAME="409"></A>desire.  Thereupon having well feasted they turned themselves to rest, 
<A NAME="410"></A>some near the ship's hawsers, others in groups throughout the mansion. 
<A NAME="411"></A> And at dawn the Etesian winds blew strongly, which by the command of Zeus 
<A NAME="412"></A>blow over every land equally.
<A NAME="413"></A><BR><BR>Cyrene, the tale goes, once tended sheep along the marsh-meadow 
<A NAME="414"></A>of Peneus among men of old time; for dear to her were maidenhood and a 
<A NAME="415"></A>couch unstained.  But, as she guarded her flock by the river, Apollo carried 
<A NAME="416"></A>her off far from Haemonia and placed her among the nymphs of the land, 
<A NAME="417"></A>who dwelt in Libya near the Myrtosian height.  And here to Phoebus she 
<A NAME="418"></A>bore Aristaeus whom the Haemonians, rich in corn-land, call "Hunter" and 
<A NAME="419"></A>"Shepherd".  Her, of his love, the god made a nymph there, of long life 
<A NAME="420"></A>and a huntress, and his son he brought while still an infant to be nurtured 
<A NAME="421"></A>in the cave of Cheiron.  And to him when he grew to manhood the Muses gave 
<A NAME="422"></A>a bride, and taught him the arts of healing and of prophecy; and they made 
<A NAME="423"></A>him the keeper of their sheep, of all that grazed on the Athamantian plain 
<A NAME="424"></A>of Phthia and round steep Othrys and the sacred stream of the river Apidanus. 
<A NAME="425"></A>But when from heaven Sirius scorched the Minoan Isles, and for long there 
<A NAME="426"></A>was no respite for the inhabitants, then by the injunction of the Far-Darter 
<A NAME="427"></A>they summoned Aristaeus to ward off the pestilence.  And by his father's 
<A NAME="428"></A>command he left Phthia and made his home in Ceos, and gathered together 
<A NAME="429"></A>the Parrhasian people who are of the lineage of Lycaon, and he built a 
<A NAME="430"></A>great altar to Zeus Icmaeus, and duly offered sacrifices upon the mountains 
<A NAME="431"></A>to that star Sirius, and to Zeus son of Cronos himself. And on this account 
<A NAME="432"></A>it is that Etesian winds from Zeus cool the land for forty days, and in 
<A NAME="433"></A>Ceos even now the priests offer sacrifices before the rising of the 
<A NAME="434"></A>Dog-star.
<A NAME="435"></A><BR><BR>So the tale is told, but the chieftains stayed there by constraint, 
<A NAME="436"></A>and every day the Thynians, doing pleasure to Phineus, sent them gifts 
<A NAME="437"></A>beyond measure.  And afterwards they raised an altar to the blessed twelve 
<A NAME="438"></A>on the sea-beach opposite and laid offerings thereon and then entered their 
<A NAME="439"></A>swift ship to row, nor did they forget to bear with them a trembling dove; 
<A NAME="440"></A>but Euphemus seized her and brought her all quivering with fear, and they 
<A NAME="441"></A>loosed the twin hawsers from the land.
<A NAME="442"></A><BR><BR>Nor did they start unmarked by Athena, but straightway swiftly 
<A NAME="443"></A>she set her feel on a light cloud, which would waft her on, mighty though 
<A NAME="444"></A>she was, and she swept on to the sea with friendly thoughts to the oarsmen. 
<A NAME="445"></A> And as when one roveth far from his native land, as we men often wander 
<A NAME="446"></A>with enduring heart, nor is any land too distant but all ways are clear 
<A NAME="447"></A>to his view, and he sees in mind his own home, and at once the way over 
<A NAME="448"></A>sea and land seems slain, and swiftly thinking, now this way, now that, 
<A NAME="449"></A>he strains with eager eyes; so swiftly the daughter of Zeus darted down 
<A NAME="450"></A>and set her foot on the cheerless shore of Thynia.
<A NAME="451"></A><BR><BR>Now when they reached the narrow strait of the winding passage, 
<A NAME="452"></A>hemmed in on both sides by rugged cliffs, while an eddying current from 
<A NAME="453"></A>below was washing against the ship as she moved on, they went forward sorely 
<A NAME="454"></A>in dread; and now the thud of the crashing rocks ceaselessly struck their 
<A NAME="455"></A>ears, and the sea-washed shores resounded, and then Euphemus grasped the 
<A NAME="456"></A>dove in his hand and started to mount the prow; and they, at the bidding 
<A NAME="457"></A>of Tiphys, son of Hagnias, rowed with good will to drive Argo between the 
<A NAME="458"></A>rocks, trusting to their strength.  And as they rounded a bend they saw 
<A NAME="459"></A>the rocks opening for the last time of all.  Their spirit melted within 
<A NAME="460"></A>them; and Euphemus sent forth the dove to dart forward in flight; and they 
<A NAME="461"></A>all together raised their heads to look; but she flew between them, and 
<A NAME="462"></A>the rocks again rushed together and crashed as they met face to face. 
<A NAME="463"></A> And the foam leapt up in a mass like a cloud; awful was the thunder of 
<A NAME="464"></A>the sea; and all round them the mighty welkin roared.
<A NAME="465"></A><BR><BR>The hollow caves beneath the rugged cliffs rumbled as the sea came 
<A NAME="466"></A>surging in; and the white foam of the dashing wave spurted high above the 
<A NAME="467"></A>cliff.  Next the current whirled the ship round.  And the rocks shore away 
<A NAME="468"></A>the end of the dove's tail- feathers; but away she flew unscathed.  And 
<A NAME="469"></A>the rowers gave a loud cry; and Tiphys himself called to them to row with 
<A NAME="470"></A>might and main.  For the rocks were again parting asunder.  But as they 
<A NAME="471"></A>rowed they trembled, until the tide returning drove them back within the 
<A NAME="472"></A>rocks.  Then most awful fear seized upon all; for over their head was destruction 
<A NAME="473"></A>without escape.  And now to right and left broad Pontus was seen, when 
<A NAME="474"></A>suddenly a huge wave rose up before them, arched, like a steep rock; and 
<A NAME="475"></A>at the sight they bowed with bended heads.  For it seemed about to leap 
<A NAME="476"></A>down upon the ship's whole length and to overwhelm them.  But Tiphys was 
<A NAME="477"></A>quick to ease the ship as she laboured with the oars; and in all its mass 
<A NAME="478"></A>the wave rolled away beneath the keel, and at the stern it raised Argo 
<A NAME="479"></A>herself and drew her far away from the rocks; and high in air was she borne. 
<A NAME="480"></A> But Euphemus strode among all his comrades and cried to them to bend to 
<A NAME="481"></A>their oars with all their might; and they with a shout smote the water. 
<A NAME="482"></A> And as far as the ship yielded to the rowers, twice as far did she leap 
<A NAME="483"></A>back, and the oar, were bent like curved bows as the heroes used their 
<A NAME="484"></A>strength.
<A NAME="485"></A><BR><BR>Then a vaulted billow rushed upon them, and the ship like a cylinder 
<A NAME="486"></A>ran on the furious wave plunging through the hollow sea.  And the eddying 
<A NAME="487"></A>current held her between the clashing rocks; and on each side they shook 
<A NAME="488"></A>and thundered; and the ship's timbers were held fast.  Then Athena with 
<A NAME="489"></A>her left hand thrust back one mighty rock and with her right pushed the 
<A NAME="490"></A>ship through; and she, like a winged arrow, sped through the air. Nevertheless 
<A NAME="491"></A>the rocks, ceaselessly clashing, shore off as she passed the extreme end 
<A NAME="492"></A>of the stern-ornament.  But Athena soared up to Olympus, when they had 
<A NAME="493"></A>escaped unscathed.  And the rocks in one spot at that moment were rooted 
<A NAME="494"></A>fast for ever to each other, which thing had been destined by the blessed 
<A NAME="495"></A>gods, when a man in his ship should have passed between them alive.  And 
<A NAME="496"></A>the heroes breathed again after their chilling fear, beholding at the same 
<A NAME="497"></A>time the sky and the expanse of sea spreading far and wide.  For they deemed 
<A NAME="498"></A>that they were saved from Hades; and Tiphys first of all began to 
<A NAME="499"></A>speak:
<A NAME="500"></A><BR><BR>"It is my hope that we have safely escaped this peril--we, and 
<A NAME="501"></A>the ship; and none other is the cause so much as Athena, who breathed into 
<A NAME="502"></A>Argo divine strength when Argus knitted her together with bolts; and she 
<A NAME="503"></A>may not be caught.  Son of Aeson, no longer fear thou so much the hest 
<A NAME="504"></A>of thy king, since a god hath granted us escape between the rocks; for 
<A NAME="505"></A>Phineus, Agenor's son, said that our toils hereafter would be lightly 
<A NAME="506"></A>accomplished."
<A NAME="507"></A><BR><BR>He spake, and at once he sped the ship onward through the midst 
<A NAME="508"></A>of the sea past the Bithynian coast.  But Jason with gentle words addressed 
<A NAME="509"></A>him in reply: "Tiphys, why dost thou comfort thus my grieving heart?  I 
<A NAME="510"></A>have erred and am distraught in wretched and helpless ruin.  For I ought, 
<A NAME="511"></A>when Pelias gave the command, to have straightway refused this quest to 
<A NAME="512"></A>his face, yea, though I were doomed to die pitilessly, torn limb from limb, 
<A NAME="513"></A>but now I am wrapped in excessive fear and cares unbearable, dreading to 
<A NAME="514"></A>sail through the chilling paths of the sea, and dreading when we shall 
<A NAME="515"></A>set foot on the mainland.  For on every side are unkindly men.  And ever 
<A NAME="516"></A>when day is done I pass a night of groans from the time when ye first gathered 
<A NAME="517"></A>together for my sake, while I take thought for all things; but thou talkest 
<A NAME="518"></A>at thine ease, eating only for thine own life; while for myself I am dismayed 
<A NAME="519"></A>not a whit; but I fear for this man and for that equally, and for thee, 
<A NAME="520"></A>and for my other comrades, if I shall not bring you back safe to the land 
<A NAME="521"></A>of Hellas."
<A NAME="522"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spake, making trial of the chiefs; but they shouted loud 
<A NAME="523"></A>with cheerful words.  And his heart was warmed within him at their cry 
<A NAME="524"></A>and again he spake outright among them:
<A NAME="525"></A><BR><BR>"My friends, in your valour my courage is quickened.  Wherefore 
<A NAME="526"></A>now, even though I should take my way through the gulfs of Hades, no more 
<A NAME="527"></A>shall I let fear seize upon me, since ye are steadfast amid cruel terrors. 
<A NAME="528"></A> But now that we have sailed out from the striking rocks, I trow that never 
<A NAME="529"></A>hereafter will there be another such fearful thing, if indeed we go on 
<A NAME="530"></A>our way following the counsel of Phineus."
<A NAME="531"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spake, and straightway they ceased from such words and 
<A NAME="532"></A>gave unwearying labour to the oar; and quickly they passed by the swiftly 
<A NAME="533"></A>flowing river Rhebas and the peak of Colone, and soon thereafter the black 
<A NAME="534"></A>headland, and near it the mouth of the river Phyllis, where aforetime Dipsaeus 
<A NAME="535"></A>received in his home the son of Athamas, when with his ram he was flying 
<A NAME="536"></A>from the city of Orchomenus; and Dipsacus was the son of a meadow- nymph, 
<A NAME="537"></A>nor was insolence his delight, but contented by his father's stream he 
<A NAME="538"></A>dwelt with his mother, pasturing his flocks by the shore.  And quickly 
<A NAME="539"></A>they sighted and sailed past his shrine and the broad banks of the river 
<A NAME="540"></A>and the plain, and deep-flowing Calpe, and all the windless night and the 
<A NAME="541"></A>day they bent to their tireless oars.  And even as ploughing oxen toil 
<A NAME="542"></A>as they cleave the moist earth, and sweat streams in abundance from flank 
<A NAME="543"></A>and neck; and from beneath the yoke their eyes roll askance, while the 
<A NAME="544"></A>breath ever rushes from their mouths in hot gasps; and all day long they 
<A NAME="545"></A>toil, planting their hoofs deep in the ground; like them the heroes kept 
<A NAME="546"></A>dragging their oars through the sea.
<A NAME="547"></A><BR><BR>Now when divine light has not yet come nor is it utter darkness, 
<A NAME="548"></A>but a faint glimmer has spread over the night, the time when men wake and 
<A NAME="549"></A>call it twilight, at that hour they ran into the harbour of the desert 
<A NAME="550"></A>island Thynias and, spent by weary toil, mounted the shore.  And to them 
<A NAME="551"></A>the son of Leto, as he passed from Lycia far away to the countless folk 
<A NAME="552"></A>of the Hyperboreans, appeared; and about his cheeks on both sides his golden 
<A NAME="553"></A>locks flowed in clusters as he moved; in his left hand he held a silver 
<A NAME="554"></A>bow, and on his back was slung a quiver hanging from his shoulders; and 
<A NAME="555"></A>beneath his feet all the island quaked, and the waves surged high on the 
<A NAME="556"></A>beach.  Helpless amazement seized them as they looked; and no one dared 
<A NAME="557"></A>to gaze face to face into the fair eyes of the god.  And they stood with 
<A NAME="558"></A>heads bowed to the ground; but he, far off, passed on to the sea through 
<A NAME="559"></A>the air; and at length Orpheus spake as follows, addressing the 
<A NAME="560"></A>chiefs:
<A NAME="561"></A><BR><BR>"Come, let us call this island the sacred isle of Apollo of the 
<A NAME="562"></A>Dawn since he has appeared to all, passing by at dawn; and we will offer 
<A NAME="563"></A>such sacrifices as we can, building an altar on the shore; and if hereafter 
<A NAME="564"></A>he shall grant us a safe return to the Haemonian land, then will we lay 
<A NAME="565"></A>on his altar the thighs of horned goats.  And now I bid you propitiate 
<A NAME="566"></A>him with the steam of sacrifice and libations.  Be gracious, O king, be 
<A NAME="567"></A>gracious in thy appearing."
<A NAME="568"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spake, and they straightway built up an altar with shingle; 
<A NAME="569"></A>and over the island they wandered, seeking if haply they could get a glimpse 
<A NAME="570"></A>of a fawn or a wild goat, that often seek their pasture in the deep wood. 
<A NAME="571"></A> And for them Leto's son provided a quarry; and with pious rites they wrapped 
<A NAME="572"></A>in fat the thigh bones of them all and burnt them on the sacred altar, 
<A NAME="573"></A>celebrating Apollo, Lord of Dawn.  And round the burning sacrifice they 
<A NAME="574"></A>set up a broad dancing-ring, singing, "All hail fair god of healing, Phoebus, 
<A NAME="575"></A>all hail," and with them Oeagrus' goodly son began a clear lay on his Bistonian 
<A NAME="576"></A>lyre; how once beneath the rocky ridge of Parnassus he slew with his bow 
<A NAME="577"></A>the monster Delphyne, he, still young and beardless, still rejoicing in 
<A NAME="578"></A>his long tresses.  Mayst thou be gracious!  Ever, O king, be thy locks 
<A NAME="579"></A>unshorn, ever unravaged; for so is it right.  And none but Leto, daughter 
<A NAME="580"></A>of Coeus, strokes them with her dear hands. And often the Corycian nymphs, 
<A NAME="581"></A>daughters of Pleistus, took up the cheering strain crying "Healer"; hence 
<A NAME="582"></A>arose this lovely refrain of the hymn to Phoebus.
<A NAME="583"></A><BR><BR>Now when they had celebrated him with dance and song they took 
<A NAME="584"></A>an oath with holy libations, that they would ever help each other with 
<A NAME="585"></A>concord of heart, touching the sacrifice as they swore; and even now there 
<A NAME="586"></A>stands there a temple to gracious Concord, which the heroes themselves 
<A NAME="587"></A>reared, paying honour at that time to the glorious goddess.
<A NAME="588"></A><BR><BR>Now when the third morning came, with a fresh west wind they left 
<A NAME="589"></A>the lofty island.  Next, on the opposite side they saw and passed the mouth 
<A NAME="590"></A>of the river Sangarius and the fertile land of the Mariandyni, and the 
<A NAME="591"></A>stream of Lycus and the Anthemoeisian lake; and beneath the breeze the 
<A NAME="592"></A>ropes and all the tackling quivered as they sped onward.  During the night 
<A NAME="593"></A>the wind ceased and at dawn they gladly reached the haven of the Acherusian 
<A NAME="594"></A>headland.  It rises aloft with steep cliffs, looking towards the Bithynian 
<A NAME="595"></A>sea; and beneath it smooth rocks, ever washed by the sea, stand rooted 
<A NAME="596"></A>firm; and round them the wave rolls and thunders loud, but above, wide-spreading 
<A NAME="597"></A>plane trees grow on the topmost point.  And from it towards the land a 
<A NAME="598"></A>hollow glen slopes gradually away, where there is a cave of Hades overarched 
<A NAME="599"></A>by wood and rocks.  From here an icy breath, unceasingly issuing from the 
<A NAME="600"></A>chill recess, ever forms a glistening rime which melts again beneath the 
<A NAME="601"></A>midday sun.  And never does silence hold that grim headland, but there 
<A NAME="602"></A>is a continual murmur from the sounding sea and the leaves that quiver 
<A NAME="603"></A>in the winds from the cave.  And here is the outfall of the river Acheron 
<A NAME="604"></A>which bursts its way through the headland and falls into the Eastern sea, 
<A NAME="605"></A>and a hollow ravine brings it down from above. In after times the Nisaean 
<A NAME="606"></A>Megarians named it Soonautes  when they were about to settle in the land 
<A NAME="607"></A>of the Mariandyni.  For indeed the river saved them with their ships when 
<A NAME="608"></A>they were caught in a violent tempest.  By this way the heroes took the 
<A NAME="609"></A>ship through  the Acherusian headland and came to land over against it 
<A NAME="610"></A>as the wind had just ceased.
<A NAME="611"></A><BR><BR>Not long had they come unmarked by Lycus, the lord of that land, 
<A NAME="612"></A>and the Mariandyni--they, the slayers of Amycus, according to the report 
<A NAME="613"></A>which the people heard before; but for that very deed they even made a 
<A NAME="614"></A>league with the heroes.  And Polydeuces himself they welcomed as a god, 
<A NAME="615"></A>flocking from every side, since for a long time had they been warring against 
<A NAME="616"></A>the arrogant Bebrycians.  And so they went up all together into the city, 
<A NAME="617"></A>and all that day with friendly feelings made ready a feast within the palace 
<A NAME="618"></A>of Lycus and gladdened their souls with converse.  Aeson's son told him 
<A NAME="619"></A>the lineage and name of each of his comrades and the behests of Pelias, 
<A NAME="620"></A>and how they were welcomed by the Lemnian women, and all that they did 
<A NAME="621"></A>at Dolionian Cyzieus; and how they reached the Mysian land and Cius, where, 
<A NAME="622"></A>sore against their will, they left behind the hero Heracles, and he told 
<A NAME="623"></A>the saying of Glaucus, and how they slew the Bebrycians and Amycus, and 
<A NAME="624"></A>he told of the prophecies and affliction of Phineus, and how they escaped 
<A NAME="625"></A>the Cyanean rocks, and how they met with Leto's son at the island.  And 
<A NAME="626"></A>as he told all, Lycus was charmed in soul with listening; and he grieved 
<A NAME="627"></A>for Heracles left behind, and spake as follows among them 
<A NAME="628"></A>all:
<A NAME="629"></A><BR><BR>"O friends, what a man he was from whose help ye have fallen away, 
<A NAME="630"></A>as ye cleave your long path to Aeetes; for well do I know that I saw him 
<A NAME="631"></A>here in the halls of Dascylus my father, when he came hither on foot through 
<A NAME="632"></A>the land of Asia bringing the girdle of warlike Hippolyte; and me he found 
<A NAME="633"></A>with the down just growing on my cheeks.  And here, when my brother Priolas 
<A NAME="634"></A>was slain by the Mysians--my brother, whom ever since the people lament 
<A NAME="635"></A>with most piteous dirges--he entered the lists with Titias in boxing and 
<A NAME="636"></A>slew him, mighty Titias, who surpassed all the youths in beauty and strength; 
<A NAME="637"></A>and he dashed his teeth to the ground.  Together with the Mysians he subdued 
<A NAME="638"></A>beneath my father's sway the Phrygians also, who inhabit the lands next 
<A NAME="639"></A>to us, and he made his own the tribes of the Bithynians and their land, 
<A NAME="640"></A>as far as the mouth of Rhebas and the peak of Colone; and besides them 
<A NAME="641"></A>the Paphlagonians of Pelops yielded just as they were, even all those round 
<A NAME="642"></A>whom the dark water of Billaeus breaks.  But now the Bebrycians and the 
<A NAME="643"></A>insolence of Amycus have robbed me, since Heracles dwells far away, for 
<A NAME="644"></A>they have long been cutting off huge pieces of my land until they have 
<A NAME="645"></A>set their bounds at the meadows of deep-flowing Hypius.  Nevertheless, 
<A NAME="646"></A>by your hands have they paid the penalty; and it was not without the will 
<A NAME="647"></A>of heaven, I trow, that he brought war on the Bebrycians this day--he, 
<A NAME="648"></A>the son of Tyndareus, when he slew that champion.  Wherefore whatever requital 
<A NAME="649"></A>I am now able to pay, gladly will I pay it, for that is the rule for weaker 
<A NAME="650"></A>men when the stronger begin to help them.  So with you all, and in your 
<A NAME="651"></A>company, I bid Dascylus my son follow; and if he goes, you will find all 
<A NAME="652"></A>men friendly that ye meet on your way through the sea even to the mouth 
<A NAME="653"></A>of the river Thermodon.  And besides that, to the sons of Tyndareus will 
<A NAME="654"></A>I raise a lofty temple on the Acherusian height, which all sailors shall 
<A NAME="655"></A>mark far across the sea and shall reverence; and hereafter for them will 
<A NAME="656"></A>I set apart outside the city, as for gods, some fertile fields of the well-tilled 
<A NAME="657"></A>plain."
<A NAME="658"></A><BR><BR>Thus all day long they revelled at the banquet. But at dawn they 
<A NAME="659"></A>hied down to the ship in haste; and with them went Lycus himself, when 
<A NAME="660"></A>he had given them countless gifts to bear away; and with them he sent forth 
<A NAME="661"></A>his son from his home.
<A NAME="662"></A><BR><BR>And here his destined fate smote Idmon, son of Abas, skilled in 
<A NAME="663"></A>soothsaying; but not at all did his soothsaying save him, for necessity 
<A NAME="664"></A>drew him on to death.  For in the mead of the reedy river there lay, cooling 
<A NAME="665"></A>his flanks and huge belly in the mud, a white-tusked boar, a deadly monster, 
<A NAME="666"></A>whom even the nymphs of the marsh dreaded, and no man knew it; but all 
<A NAME="667"></A>alone he was feeding in the wide fell.  But the son of Abas was passing 
<A NAME="668"></A>along the raised banks of the muddy river, and the boar from some unseen 
<A NAME="669"></A>lair leapt out of the reed-bed, and charging gashed his thigh and severed 
<A NAME="670"></A>in twain the sinews and the bone.  And with a sharp cry the hero fell to 
<A NAME="671"></A>the ground; and as he was struck his comrades flocked together with answering 
<A NAME="672"></A>cry.  And quickly Peleus with his hunting spear aimed at the murderous 
<A NAME="673"></A>boar as he fled back into the fen; and again he turned and charged; but 
<A NAME="674"></A>Idas wounded him, and with a roar he fell impaled upon the sharp spear. 
<A NAME="675"></A> And the boar they left on the ground just as he had fallen there; but 
<A NAME="676"></A>Idmon, now at the last gasp, his comrades bore to the ship in sorrow of 
<A NAME="677"></A>heart, and he died in his comrades' arms.
<A NAME="678"></A><BR><BR>And here they stayed from taking thought for their voyaging and 
<A NAME="679"></A>abode in grief for the burial of their dead friend. And for three whole 
<A NAME="680"></A>days they lamented; and on the next they buried him with full honours, 
<A NAME="681"></A>and the people and King Lycus himself took part in the funeral rites; and, 
<A NAME="682"></A>as is the due of the departed, they slaughtered countless sheep at his 
<A NAME="683"></A>tomb.  And so a barrow to this hero was raised in that land, and there 
<A NAME="684"></A>stands a token for men of later days to see, the trunk of a wild olive 
<A NAME="685"></A>tree, such as ships are built of; and it flourishes with its green leaves 
<A NAME="686"></A>a little below the Acherusian headland.  And if at the bidding of the Muses 
<A NAME="687"></A>I must tell this tale outright, Phoebus strictly commanded the Boeotians 
<A NAME="688"></A>and Nisaeans to worship him as guardian of their city, and to build their 
<A NAME="689"></A>city round the trunk of the ancient wild olive; but they, instead of the 
<A NAME="690"></A>god-fearing Aeolid Idmon, at this day honour Agamestor.
<A NAME="691"></A><BR><BR>Who was the next that died?  For then a second time the heroes 
<A NAME="692"></A>heaped up a barrow for a comrade dead.  For still are to be seen two monuments 
<A NAME="693"></A>of those heroes.  The tale goes that Tiphys son of Hagnias died; nor was 
<A NAME="694"></A>it his destiny thereafter to sail any further.  But him there on the spot 
<A NAME="695"></A>a short sickness laid to rest far from his native land, when the company 
<A NAME="696"></A>had paid due honours to the dead son of Abas.  And at the cruel woe they 
<A NAME="697"></A>were seized with unbearable grief.  For when with due honours they had 
<A NAME="698"></A>buried him also hard by the seer, they cast themselves down in helplessness 
<A NAME="699"></A>on the sea-shore silently, closely wrapped up, and took no thought for 
<A NAME="700"></A>meat or drink; and their spirit drooped in grief, for all hope of return 
<A NAME="701"></A>was gone.  And in their sorrow they would have stayed from going further 
<A NAME="702"></A>had not Hera kindled exceeding courage in Ancaeus, whom near the waters 
<A NAME="703"></A>of Imbrasus Astypalaea bore to Poseidon; for especially was he skilled 
<A NAME="704"></A>in steering and eagerly did he address Peleus:
<A NAME="705"></A><BR><BR>"Son of Aeacus, is it well for us to give up our toils and linger 
<A NAME="706"></A>on in a strange land?  Not so much for my prowess in war did Jason take 
<A NAME="707"></A>me with him in quest of the fleece, far from Parthenia, as for my knowledge 
<A NAME="708"></A>of ships.  Wherefore, I pray, let there be no fear for the ship.  And so 
<A NAME="709"></A>there are here other men of skill, of whom none will harm our voyaging, 
<A NAME="710"></A>whomsoever we set at the helm.  But quickly tell forth all this and boldly 
<A NAME="711"></A>urge them to call to mind their task."
<A NAME="712"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spake; and Peleus' soul was stirred with gladness, and 
<A NAME="713"></A>straightway he spake in the midst of all: "My friends, why do we thus cherish 
<A NAME="714"></A>a bootless grief like this?  For those two have perished by the fate they 
<A NAME="715"></A>have met with; but among our host are steersmen yet, and many a one.  Wherefore 
<A NAME="716"></A>let us not delay our attempt, but rouse yourselves to the work and cast 
<A NAME="717"></A>away your griefs."
<A NAME="718"></A><BR><BR>And him in reply Aeson's son addressed with helpless words: "Son 
<A NAME="719"></A>of Aeacus, where are these steersmen of thine?  For those whom we once 
<A NAME="720"></A>deemed to be men of skill, they even more than I are bowed with vexation 
<A NAME="721"></A>of heart.  Wherefore I forebode an evil doom for us even as for the dead, 
<A NAME="722"></A>if it shall be our lot neither to reach the city of fell Aeetes, nor ever 
<A NAME="723"></A>again to pass beyond the rocks to the land of Hellas, but a wretched fate 
<A NAME="724"></A>will enshroud us here ingloriously till we grow old for 
<A NAME="725"></A>naught."
<A NAME="726"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spake, but Ancaeus quickly undertook to guide the swift 
<A NAME="727"></A>ship; for he was stirred by the impulse of the goddess.  And after him 
<A NAME="728"></A>Erginus and Nauplius and Euphemus started up, eager to steer.  But the 
<A NAME="729"></A>others held them back, and many of his comrades granted it to 
<A NAME="730"></A>Ancaeus.
<A NAME="731"></A><BR><BR>So on the twelfth day they went aboard at dawn, for a strong breeze 
<A NAME="732"></A>of westerly wind was blowing.  And quickly with the oars they passed out 
<A NAME="733"></A>through the river Acheron and, trusting to the wind, shook out their sails, 
<A NAME="734"></A>and with canvas spread far and wide they were cleaving their passage through 
<A NAME="735"></A>the waves in fair weather.  And soon they passed the outfall of the river 
<A NAME="736"></A>Callichorus, where, as the tale goes, the Nysean son of Zeus, when he had 
<A NAME="737"></A>left the tribes of the Indians and came to dwell at Thebes, held revels 
<A NAME="738"></A>and arrayed dances in front of a cave, wherein he passed unsmiling sacred 
<A NAME="739"></A>nights, from which time the neighbours call the river by the name of Callichorus 
<A NAME="740"></A> and the cave Aulion.
<A NAME="741"></A><BR><BR>Next they beheld the barrow of Sthenelus, Actor's son, who on his 
<A NAME="742"></A>way back from the valorous war against the Amazons--for he had been the 
<A NAME="743"></A>comrade of Heracles--was struck by an arrow and died there upon the sea-beach. 
<A NAME="744"></A> And for a time they went no further, for Persephone herself sent forth 
<A NAME="745"></A>the spirit of Actor's son which craved with many tears to behold men like 
<A NAME="746"></A>himself, even for a moment.  And mounting on the edge of the barrow he 
<A NAME="747"></A>gazed upon the ship, such as he was when he went to war; and round his 
<A NAME="748"></A>head a fair helm with four peaks gleamed with its blood-red crest.  And 
<A NAME="749"></A>again he entered the vast gloom; and they looked and marvelled; and Mopsus, 
<A NAME="750"></A>son of Ampycus, with word of prophecy urged them to land and propitiate 
<A NAME="751"></A>him with libations. Quickly they drew in sail and threw out hawsers, and 
<A NAME="752"></A>on the strand paid honour to the tomb of Sthenelus, and poured out drink 
<A NAME="753"></A>offerings to him and sacrificed sheep as victims.  And besides the drink 
<A NAME="754"></A>offerings they built an altar to Apollo, saviour of ships, and burnt thigh 
<A NAME="755"></A>bones; and Orpheus dedicated his lyre; whence the place has the name of 
<A NAME="756"></A>Lyra.
<A NAME="757"></A><BR><BR>And straightway they went aboard as the wind blew strong; and they 
<A NAME="758"></A>drew the sail down, and made it taut to both sheets; then Argo was borne 
<A NAME="759"></A>over the sea swiftly, even as a hawk soaring high through the air commits 
<A NAME="760"></A>to the breeze its outspread wings and is borne on swiftly, nor swerves 
<A NAME="761"></A>in its flight, poising in the clear sky with quiet pinions.  And lo, they 
<A NAME="762"></A>passed by the stream of Parthenius as it flows into the sea, a most gentle 
<A NAME="763"></A>river, where the maid, daughter of Leto, when she mounts to heaven after 
<A NAME="764"></A>the chase, cools her limbs in its much-desired waters.  Then they sped 
<A NAME="765"></A>onward in the night without ceasing, and passed Sesamus and lofty Erythini, 
<A NAME="766"></A>Crobialus, Cromna and woody Cytorus.  Next they swept round Carambis at 
<A NAME="767"></A>the rising of the sun, and plied the oars past long Aegialus, all day and 
<A NAME="768"></A>on through the night.
<A NAME="769"></A><BR><BR>And straightway they landed on the Assyrian shore where Zeus himself 
<A NAME="770"></A>gave a home to Sinope, daughter of Asopus, and granted her virginity, beguiled 
<A NAME="771"></A>by his own promises.  For he longed for her love, and he promised to grant 
<A NAME="772"></A>her whatever her hearts desire might be.  And she in her craftiness asked 
<A NAME="773"></A>of him virginity.  And in like manner she deceived Apollo too who longed 
<A NAME="774"></A>to wed her, and besides them the river Halys, and no man ever subdued her 
<A NAME="775"></A>in love's embrace.  And there the sons of noble Deimachus of Tricca were 
<A NAME="776"></A>still dwelling, Deileon, Autolycus and Phlogius, since the day when they 
<A NAME="777"></A>wandered far away from Heracles; and they, when they marked the array of 
<A NAME="778"></A>chieftains, went to meet them and declared in truth who they were; and 
<A NAME="779"></A>they wished to remain there no longer, but as soon as Argestes blew went 
<A NAME="780"></A>on ship-board.  And so with them, borne along by the swift breeze, the 
<A NAME="781"></A>heroes left behind the river Halys, and left behind his that flows hard 
<A NAME="782"></A>by, and the delta-land of Assyria; and on the same day they rounded the 
<A NAME="783"></A>distant headland of the Amazons that guards their harbour.
<A NAME="784"></A><BR><BR>Here once when Melanippe, daughter of Ares, had, gone forth, the 
<A NAME="785"></A>hero Heracles caught her by ambuscade and Hippolyte gave him her glistening 
<A NAME="786"></A>girdle as her sister's ransom, and he sent away his captive unharmed. 
<A NAME="787"></A> In the bay of this headland, at the outfall of Thermodon, they ran ashore, 
<A NAME="788"></A>for the sea was rough for their voyage.  No river is like this, and none 
<A NAME="789"></A>sends forth from itself such mighty streams over the land.  If a man should 
<A NAME="790"></A>count every one he would lack but four of a hundred, but the real spring 
<A NAME="791"></A>is only one.  This flows down to the plain from lofty mountains, which, 
<A NAME="792"></A>men say, are called the Amazonian mountains.  Thence it spreads inland 
<A NAME="793"></A>over a hilly country straight forward; wherefrom its streams go winding 
<A NAME="794"></A>on, and they roll on, this way and that ever more, wherever best they can 
<A NAME="795"></A>reach the lower ground, one at a distance and another near at hand; and 
<A NAME="796"></A>many streams are swallowed up in the sand and are without a name; but, 
<A NAME="797"></A>mingled with a few, the main stream openly bursts with its arching crest 
<A NAME="798"></A>of foam into the inhospitable Pontus.  And they would have tarried there 
<A NAME="799"></A>and have closed in battle with the Amazons, and would have fought not without 
<A NAME="800"></A>bloodshed for the Amazons were not gentle foes and regarded not justice, 
<A NAME="801"></A>those dwellers on the Doeantian plain; but grievous insolence and the works 
<A NAME="802"></A>of Ares were all their care; for by race they were the daughters of Ares 
<A NAME="803"></A>and the nymph Harmonia, who bare to Ares war-loving maids, wedded to him 
<A NAME="804"></A>in the glens of the Acmonian wood had not the breezes of Argestes come 
<A NAME="805"></A>again from Zeus; and with the wind they left the rounded beach, where the 
<A NAME="806"></A>Themiscyreian Amazons were arming for war.  For they dwelt not gathered 
<A NAME="807"></A>together in one city, but scattered over the land, parted into three tribes. 
<A NAME="808"></A> In one part dwelt the Themiscyreians, over whom at that time Hippolyte 
<A NAME="809"></A>reigned, in another the Lycastians, and in another the dart-throwing Chadesians. 
<A NAME="810"></A> And the next day they sped on and at nightfall they reached the land of 
<A NAME="811"></A>the Chalybes.
<A NAME="812"></A><BR><BR>That folk have no care for ploughing with oxen or for any planting 
<A NAME="813"></A>of honey-sweet fruit; nor yet do they pasture flocks in the dewy meadow. 
<A NAME="814"></A> But they cleave the hard iron-bearing land and exchange their wages for 
<A NAME="815"></A>daily sustenance; never does the morn rise for them without toil, but amid 
<A NAME="816"></A>bleak sooty flames and smoke they endure heavy labour.
<A NAME="817"></A><BR><BR>And straightway thereafter they rounded the headland of Genetaean 
<A NAME="818"></A>Zeus and sped safely past the land of the Tibareni.  Here when wives bring 
<A NAME="819"></A>forth children to their husbands, the men lie in bed and groan with their 
<A NAME="820"></A>heads close bound; but the women tend them with food, and prepare child-birth 
<A NAME="821"></A>baths for them.
<A NAME="822"></A><BR><BR>Next they reached the sacred mount and the land where the Mossynoeci 
<A NAME="823"></A>dwell amid high mountains in wooden huts, from which that people take their 
<A NAME="824"></A>name.  And strange are their customs and laws.  Whatever it is right to 
<A NAME="825"></A>do openly before the people or in the market place, all this they do in 
<A NAME="826"></A>their homes, but whatever acts we perform at home, these they perform out 
<A NAME="827"></A>of doors in the midst of the streets, without blame.  And among them is 
<A NAME="828"></A>no reverence for the marriage-bed, but, like swine that feed in herds, 
<A NAME="829"></A>no whit abashed in others' presence, on the earth they lie with the women. 
<A NAME="830"></A> Their king sits in the loftiest hut and dispenses upright judgments to 
<A NAME="831"></A>the multitude, poor wretch!  For if haply he err at all in his decrees, 
<A NAME="832"></A>for that day they keep him shut up in starvation.
<A NAME="833"></A><BR><BR>They passed them by and cleft their way with oars over against 
<A NAME="834"></A>the island of Ares all day long; for at dusk the light breeze left them. 
<A NAME="835"></A> At last they spied above them, hurtling through the air, one of the birds 
<A NAME="836"></A>of Ares which haunt that isle.  It shook its wings down over the ship as 
<A NAME="837"></A>she sped on and sent against her a keen feather, and it fell on the left 
<A NAME="838"></A>shoulder of goodly Oileus, and he dropped his oar from his hands at the 
<A NAME="839"></A>sudden blow, and his comrades marvelled at the sight of the winged bolt. 
<A NAME="840"></A> And Eribotes from his seat hard by drew out the feather, and bound up 
<A NAME="841"></A>the wound when he had loosed the strap hanging from his own sword-sheath; 
<A NAME="842"></A>and besides the first, another bird appeared swooping down; but the hero 
<A NAME="843"></A>Clytius, son of Eurytus -- for he bent his curved bow, and sped a swift 
<A NAME="844"></A>arrow against the bird--struck it, and it whirled round and fell close 
<A NAME="845"></A>to the ship.  And to them spake Amphidamas, son of Aleus:
<A NAME="846"></A><BR><BR>"The island of Ares is near us; you know it yourselves now that 
<A NAME="847"></A>ye have seen these birds.  But little will arrows avail us, I trow, for 
<A NAME="848"></A>landing.  But let us contrive some other device to help us, if ye intend 
<A NAME="849"></A>to land, bearing in mind the injunction of Phineus.  For not even could 
<A NAME="850"></A>Heracles, when he came to Arcadia, drive away with bow and arrow the birds 
<A NAME="851"></A>that swam on the Stymphalian lake.  I saw it myself.  But he shook in his 
<A NAME="852"></A>hand a rattle of bronze and made a loud clatter as he stood upon a lofty 
<A NAME="853"></A>peak, and the birds fled far off, screeching in bewildered fear.  Wherefore 
<A NAME="854"></A>now too let us contrive some such device, and I myself will speak, having 
<A NAME="855"></A>pondered the matter beforehand.  Set on your heads your helmets of lofty 
<A NAME="856"></A>crest, then half row by turns, and half fence the ship about with polished 
<A NAME="857"></A>spears and shields.  Then all together raise a mighty shout so that the 
<A NAME="858"></A>birds may be scared by the unwonted din, the nodding crests, and the uplifted 
<A NAME="859"></A>spears on high.  And if we reach the island itself, then make mighty noise 
<A NAME="860"></A>with the clashing of shields."
<A NAME="861"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spake, and the helpful device pleased all.  And on their 
<A NAME="862"></A>heads they placed helmets of bronze, gleaming terribly, and the blood-red 
<A NAME="863"></A>crests were tossing.  And half of them rowed in turn, and the rest covered 
<A NAME="864"></A>the ship with spears and shields.  And as when a man roofs over a house 
<A NAME="865"></A>with tiles, to be an ornament of his home and a defence against rain, and 
<A NAME="866"></A>one the fits firmly into another, each after each; so they roofed over 
<A NAME="867"></A>the ship with their shields, locking them together.  And as a din arises 
<A NAME="868"></A>from a warrior-host of men sweeping on, when lines of battle meet, such 
<A NAME="869"></A>a shout rose upward from the ship into the air. Now they saw none of the 
<A NAME="870"></A>birds yet, but when they touched the island and clashed upon their shields, 
<A NAME="871"></A>then the birds in countless numbers rose in flight hither and thither. 
<A NAME="872"></A> And as when the son of Cronos sends from the clouds a dense hailstorm 
<A NAME="873"></A>on city and houses, and the people who dwell beneath hear the din above 
<A NAME="874"></A>the roof and sit quietly, since the stormy season has not come upon them 
<A NAME="875"></A>unawares, but they have first made strong their roofs; so the birds sent 
<A NAME="876"></A>against the heroes a thick shower of feather- shafts as they darted over 
<A NAME="877"></A>the sea to the mountains of the land opposite.
<A NAME="878"></A><BR><BR>What then was the purpose of Phineus in bidding the divine band 
<A NAME="879"></A>of heroes land there?  Or what kind of help was about to meet their 
<A NAME="880"></A>desire?
<A NAME="881"></A><BR><BR>The sons of Phrixus were faring towards the city of Orchomenus 
<A NAME="882"></A>from Aea, coming from Cytaean Aeetes, on board a Colchian ship, to win 
<A NAME="883"></A>the boundless wealth of their father; for he, when dying, had enjoined 
<A NAME="884"></A>this journey upon them.  And lo, on that day they were very near that island. 
<A NAME="885"></A> But Zeus had impelled the north wind's might to blow, marking by rain 
<A NAME="886"></A>the moist path of Arcturus; and all day long he was stirring the leaves 
<A NAME="887"></A>upon the mountains, breathing gently upon the topmost sprays; but at night 
<A NAME="888"></A>he rushed upon the sea with monstrous force, and with his shrieking blasts 
<A NAME="889"></A>uplifted the surge; and a dark mist covered the heavens, nor did the bright 
<A NAME="890"></A>stars anywhere appear from among the clouds, but a murky gloom brooded 
<A NAME="891"></A>all around.  And so the sons of Phrixus, drenched and trembling in fear 
<A NAME="892"></A>of a horrible doom, were borne along by the waves helplessly.  And the 
<A NAME="893"></A>force of the wind had snatched away their sails and shattered in twain 
<A NAME="894"></A>the hull, tossed as it was by the breakers.  And hereupon by heaven's prompting 
<A NAME="895"></A>those four clutched a huge beam, one of many that were scattered about, 
<A NAME="896"></A>held together by sharp bolts, when the ship broke to pieces.  And on to 
<A NAME="897"></A>the island the waves and the blasts of wind bore the men in their distress, 
<A NAME="898"></A>within a little of death. And straightway a mighty rain burst forth, and 
<A NAME="899"></A>rained upon the sea and the island, and all the country opposite the island, 
<A NAME="900"></A>where the arrogant Mossynoeci dwelt.  And the sweep of the waves hurled 
<A NAME="901"></A>the sons of Phrixus, together with their massy beam, upon the beach of 
<A NAME="902"></A>the island, in the murky night; and the floods of rain from Zeus ceased 
<A NAME="903"></A>at sunrise, and soon the two bands drew near and met each other, and Argus 
<A NAME="904"></A>spoke first:
<A NAME="905"></A><BR><BR>"We beseech you, by Zeus the Beholder, whoever ye are, to be kindly 
<A NAME="906"></A>and to help us in our need.  For fierce tempests, falling on the sea, have 
<A NAME="907"></A>shattered all the timbers of the crazy ship in which we were cleaving our 
<A NAME="908"></A>path on business bent.  Wherefore we entreat you, if haply ye will listen, 
<A NAME="909"></A>to grant us just a covering for our bodies, and to pity and succour men 
<A NAME="910"></A>in misfortune, your equals in age.  Oh, reverence suppliants and strangers 
<A NAME="911"></A>for Zeus' sake, the god of strangers and suppliants.  To Zeus belong both 
<A NAME="912"></A>suppliants and strangers; and his eye, methinks, beholdeth even 
<A NAME="913"></A>us."
<A NAME="914"></A><BR><BR>And in reply the son of Aeson prudently questioned him, deeming 
<A NAME="915"></A>that the prophecies of Phineus were being fulfilled: "All these things 
<A NAME="916"></A>will we straightway grant you with right good will.  But come tell me truly 
<A NAME="917"></A>in what country ye dwell and what business bids you sail across the sea, 
<A NAME="918"></A>and tell me your own glorious names and lineage."
<A NAME="919"></A><BR><BR>And him Argus, helpless in his evil plight, addressed: "That one 
<A NAME="920"></A>Phrixus an Aeolid reached Aea from Hellas you yourselves have clearly heard 
<A NAME="921"></A>ere this, I trow; Phrixus, who came to the city of Aeetes, bestriding a 
<A NAME="922"></A>ram, which Hermes had made all gold; and the fleece ye may see even now. 
<A NAME="923"></A> The ram, at its own prompting, he then sacrificed to Zeus, son of Cronos, 
<A NAME="924"></A>above all, the god of fugitives.  And him did Aeetes receive in his palace, 
<A NAME="925"></A>and with gladness of heart gave him his daughter Chalciope in marriage 
<A NAME="926"></A>without gifts of wooing.   From those two are we sprung. But Phrixus died 
<A NAME="927"></A>at last, an aged man, in the home of Aeetes; and we, giving heed to our 
<A NAME="928"></A>father's behests, are journeying to Orehomenus to take the possessions 
<A NAME="929"></A>of Athamas. And if thou dost desire to learn our names, this is Cytissorus, 
<A NAME="930"></A>this Phrontis, and this Melas, and me ye may. call Argus."
<A NAME="931"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spake, and the chieftains rejoiced at the meeting, and 
<A NAME="932"></A>tended them, much marvelling.  And Jason again in turn replied, as was 
<A NAME="933"></A>fitting, with these words:
<A NAME="934"></A><BR><BR>"Surely ye are our kinsmen on my father's side, and ye pray that 
<A NAME="935"></A>with kindly hearts we succour your evil plight. For Cretheus and Athamas 
<A NAME="936"></A>were brothers.  I am the grandson of Cretheus, and with these comrades 
<A NAME="937"></A>here I am journeying from that same Hellas to the city of Aeetes.  But 
<A NAME="938"></A>of these things we will converse hereafter.  And do ye first put clothing 
<A NAME="939"></A>upon you.  By heaven's devising, I ween, have ye come to my hands in your 
<A NAME="940"></A>sore need."
<A NAME="941"></A><BR><BR>He spake, and out of the ship gave them raiment to put on.  Then 
<A NAME="942"></A>all together they went to the temple of Ares to offer sacrifice of sheep; 
<A NAME="943"></A>and in haste they stood round the altar, which was outside the roofless 
<A NAME="944"></A>temple, an altar built of pebbles; within a black stone stood fixed, a 
<A NAME="945"></A>sacred thing, to which of yore the Amazons all used to pray.  Nor was it 
<A NAME="946"></A>lawful for them, when they came from the opposite coast, to burn on this 
<A NAME="947"></A>altar offerings of sheep and oxen, but they used to slay horses which they 
<A NAME="948"></A>kept in great herds.  Now when they had sacrificed and eaten the feast 
<A NAME="949"></A>prepared, then Aeson's son spake among them and thus 
<A NAME="950"></A>began:
<A NAME="951"></A><BR><BR>"Zeus' self, I ween, beholds everything; nor do we men escape his 
<A NAME="952"></A>eye, we that be god-fearing and just, for as he rescued your father from 
<A NAME="953"></A>the hands of a murderous step-dame and gave him measureless wealth besides; 
<A NAME="954"></A>even so hath he saved you harmless from the baleful storm.  And on board 
<A NAME="955"></A>this ship ye may sail hither and thither, where ye will, whether to Aea 
<A NAME="956"></A>or to the wealthy city of divine Orthomenus.  For our ship Athena built 
<A NAME="957"></A>and with axe of bronze cut her timbers near the crest of Pelion, and with 
<A NAME="958"></A>the goddess wrought Argus.  But yours the fierce surge hath shattered, 
<A NAME="959"></A>before ye came nigh to the rocks which all day long clash together in the 
<A NAME="960"></A>straits of the sea.  But come, be yourselves our helpers, for we are eager 
<A NAME="961"></A>to bring to Hellas the golden fleece, and guide us on our voyage, for I 
<A NAME="962"></A>go to atone for the intended sacrifice of Phrixus, the cause of Zeus' wrath 
<A NAME="963"></A>against the sons of Aeolus."
<A NAME="964"></A><BR><BR>He spake with soothing words; but horror seized them when they 
<A NAME="965"></A>heard.  For they deemed that they would not find Aeetes friendly if they 
<A NAME="966"></A>desired to take away the ram's fleece. And Argus spake as follows, vexed 
<A NAME="967"></A>that they should busy themselves with such a quest:
<A NAME="968"></A><BR><BR>"My friends, our strength, so far as it avails, shall never cease 
<A NAME="969"></A>to help you, not one whit, when need shall come.  But Aeetes is terribly 
<A NAME="970"></A>armed with deadly ruthlessness; wherefore exceedingly do I dread this voyage. 
<A NAME="971"></A> And he boasts himself to be the son of Helios; and all round dwell countless 
<A NAME="972"></A>tribes of Colchians; and he might match himself with Ares in his dread 
<A NAME="973"></A>war-cry and giant strength.  Nay, to seize the fleece in spite of Aeetes 
<A NAME="974"></A>is no easy task; so huge a serpent keeps guard round and about it, deathless 
<A NAME="975"></A>and sleepless, which Earth herself brought forth on the sides of Caucasus, 
<A NAME="976"></A>by the rock of Typhaon, where Typhaon, they say, smitten by the bolt of 
<A NAME="977"></A>Zeus, son of Cronos, when he lifted against the god his sturdy hands, dropped 
<A NAME="978"></A>from his head hot gore; and in such plight he reached the mountains and 
<A NAME="979"></A>plain of Nysa, where to this day he lies whelmed beneath the waters of 
<A NAME="980"></A>the Serbonian lake."
<A NAME="981"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spake, and straightway many a cheek grew pale when they 
<A NAME="982"></A>heard of so mighty an adventure.  But quickly Peleus answered with cheering 
<A NAME="983"></A>words, and thus spake:
<A NAME="984"></A><BR><BR>"Be not so fearful in spirit, my good friend. For we are not so 
<A NAME="985"></A>lacking in prowess as to be no match for Aeetes to try his strength with 
<A NAME="986"></A>arms; but I deem that we too are cunning in war, we that go thither, near 
<A NAME="987"></A>akin to the blood of the blessed gods.  Wherefore if he will not grant 
<A NAME="988"></A>us the fleece of gold for friendship's sake, the tribes of the Colchians 
<A NAME="989"></A>will not avail him, I ween."
<A NAME="990"></A><BR><BR>Thus they addressed each other in turn, until again, satisfied 
<A NAME="991"></A>with their feast, they turned to rest.  And when they rose at dawn a gentle 
<A NAME="992"></A>breeze was blowing; and they raised the sails, which strained to the rush 
<A NAME="993"></A>of the wind, and quickly they left behind the island of 
<A NAME="994"></A>Ares.
<A NAME="995"></A><BR><BR>And at nightfall they came to the island of Philyra, where Cronos, 
<A NAME="996"></A>son of Uranus, what time in Olympus he reigned over the Titans, and Zeus 
<A NAME="997"></A>was yet being nurtured in a Cretan cave by the Curetes of Ida, lay beside 
<A NAME="998"></A>Philyra, when he had deceived Rhea; and the goddess found them in the midst 
<A NAME="999"></A>of their dalliance; and Cronos leapt up from the couch with a rush in the 
<A NAME="1000"></A>form of a steed with flowing mane, but Ocean's daughter, Philyra, in shame 
<A NAME="1001"></A>left the spot and those haunts, and came to the long Pelasgian ridges, 
<A NAME="1002"></A>where by her union with the transfigured deity she brought forth huge Cheiron, 
<A NAME="1003"></A>half like a horse, half like a god.
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR><BR>Thence they sailed on, past the Macrones and the far-stretching 
<A NAME="1005"></A>land of the Becheiri and the overweening Sapeires, and after them the Byzeres; 
<A NAME="1006"></A>for ever forward they clave their way, quickly borne by the gentle breeze. 
<A NAME="1007"></A> And lo, as they sped on, a deep gulf of the sea was opened, and lo, the 
<A NAME="1008"></A>steep crags of the Caucasian mountains rose up, where, with his limbs bound 
<A NAME="1009"></A>upon the hard rocks by galling fetters of bronze, Prometheus fed with his 
<A NAME="1010"></A>liver an eagle that ever rushed back to its prey.  High above the ship 
<A NAME="1011"></A>at even they saw it flying with a loud whirr, near the clouds; and yet 
<A NAME="1012"></A>it shook all the sails with the fanning of those huge wings.  For it had 
<A NAME="1013"></A>not the form of a bird of the air but kept poising its long wing-feathers 
<A NAME="1014"></A>like polished oars.  And not long after they heard the bitter cry of Prometheus 
<A NAME="1015"></A>as his liver was being torn away; and the air rang with his screams until 
<A NAME="1016"></A>they marked the ravening eagle rushing back from the mountain on the self-same 
<A NAME="1017"></A>track.  And at night, by the skill of Argus, they reached broad-flowing 
<A NAME="1018"></A>Phasis, and the utmost bourne of the sea.
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR><BR>And straightway they let down the sails and the yard-arm and stowed 
<A NAME="1020"></A>them inside the hollow mast-crutch, and at once they lowered the mast itself 
<A NAME="1021"></A>till it lay along; and quickly with oars they entered the mighty stream 
<A NAME="1022"></A>of the river; and round the prow the water surged as it gave them way. 
<A NAME="1023"></A> And on their left hand they had lofty Caucasus and the Cytaean city of 
<A NAME="1024"></A>Aea, and on the other side the plain of Ares and the sacred grove of that 
<A NAME="1025"></A>god, where the serpent was keeping watch and ward over the fleece as it 
<A NAME="1026"></A>hung on the leafy branches of an oak.  And Aeson's son himself from a golden 
<A NAME="1027"></A>goblet poured into the river libations of honey and pure wine to Earth 
<A NAME="1028"></A>and to the gods of the country, and to the souls of dead heroes; and he 
<A NAME="1029"></A>besought them of their grace to give kindly aid, and to welcome their ship's 
<A NAME="1030"></A>hawsers with favourable omen.  And straightway Ancaeus spake these 
<A NAME="1031"></A>words:
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR><BR>"We have reached the Colchian land and the stream of Phasis; and 
<A NAME="1033"></A>it is time for us to take counsel whether we shall make trial of Aeetes 
<A NAME="1034"></A>with soft words, or an attempt of another kind shall be 
<A NAME="1035"></A>fitting."
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR><BR>Thus he spake, and by the advice of Argus Jason bade them enter 
<A NAME="1037"></A>a shaded backwater and let the ship ride at anchor off shore; and it was 
<A NAME="1038"></A>near at hand in their course and there they passed the night.  And soon 
<A NAME="1039"></A>the dawn appeared to their expectant eyes.
