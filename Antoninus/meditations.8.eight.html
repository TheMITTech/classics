<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>This reflection also tends to the removal of the desire of empty fame, 
<A NAME="11"></A>that it is no longer in thy power to have lived the whole of thy life, 
<A NAME="12"></A>or at least thy life from thy youth upwards, like a philosopher; but both 
<A NAME="13"></A>to many others and to thyself it is plain that thou art far from philosophy. 
<A NAME="14"></A>Thou hast fallen into disorder then, so that it is no longer easy for thee 
<A NAME="15"></A>to get the reputation of a philosopher; and thy plan of life also opposes 
<A NAME="16"></A>it. If then thou hast truly seen where the matter lies, throw away the 
<A NAME="17"></A>thought, How thou shalt seem to others, and be content if thou shalt live 
<A NAME="18"></A>the rest of thy life in such wise as thy nature wills. Observe then what 
<A NAME="19"></A>it wills, and let nothing else distract thee; for thou hast had experience 
<A NAME="20"></A>of many wanderings without having found happiness anywhere, not in syllogisms, 
<A NAME="21"></A>nor in wealth, nor in reputation, nor in enjoyment, nor anywhere. Where 
<A NAME="22"></A>is it then? In doing what man's nature requires. How then shall a man do 
<A NAME="23"></A>this? If he has principles from which come his affects and his acts. What 
<A NAME="24"></A>principles? Those which relate to good and bad: the belief that there is 
<A NAME="25"></A>nothing good for man, which does not make him just, temperate, manly, free; 
<A NAME="26"></A>and that there is nothing bad, which does not do the contrary to what has 
<A NAME="27"></A>been mentioned.
<A NAME="28"></A><BR><BR>On the occasion of every act ask thyself, How is this with respect 
<A NAME="29"></A>to me? Shall I repent of it? A little time and I am dead, and all is gone. 
<A NAME="30"></A>What more do I seek, if what I am now doing is work of an intelligent living 
<A NAME="31"></A>being, and a social being, and one who is under the same law with 
<A NAME="32"></A>God?
<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR>Alexander and Gaius and Pompeius, what are they in comparison with 
<A NAME="34"></A>Diogenes and Heraclitus and Socrates? For they were acquainted with things, 
<A NAME="35"></A>and their causes (forms), and their matter, and the ruling principles of 
<A NAME="36"></A>these men were the same. But as to the others, how many things had they 
<A NAME="37"></A>to care for, and to how many things were they slaves?
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR>Consider that men will do the same things nevertheless, even though 
<A NAME="39"></A>thou shouldst burst.
<A NAME="40"></A><BR><BR>This is the chief thing: Be not perturbed, for all things are according 
<A NAME="41"></A>to the nature of the universal; and in a little time thou wilt be nobody 
<A NAME="42"></A>and nowhere, like Hadrian and Augustus. In the next place having fixed 
<A NAME="43"></A>thy eyes steadily on thy business look at it, and at the same time remembering 
<A NAME="44"></A>that it is thy duty to be a good man, and what man's nature demands, do 
<A NAME="45"></A>that without turning aside; and speak as it seems to thee most just, only 
<A NAME="46"></A>let it be with a good disposition and with modesty and without 
<A NAME="47"></A>hypocrisy.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>The nature of the universal has this work to do, to remove to that 
<A NAME="49"></A>place the things which are in this, to change them, to take them away hence, 
<A NAME="50"></A>and to carry them there. All things are change, yet we need not fear anything 
<A NAME="51"></A>new. All things are familiar to us; but the distribution of them still 
<A NAME="52"></A>remains the same.
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR>Every nature is contented with itself when it goes on its way well; 
<A NAME="54"></A>and a rational nature goes on its way well, when in its thoughts it assents 
<A NAME="55"></A>to nothing false or uncertain, and when it directs its movements to social 
<A NAME="56"></A>acts only, and when it confines its desires and aversions to the things 
<A NAME="57"></A>which are in its power, and when it is satisfied with everything that is 
<A NAME="58"></A>assigned to it by the common nature. For of this common nature every particular 
<A NAME="59"></A>nature is a part, as the nature of the leaf is a part of the nature of 
<A NAME="60"></A>the plant; except that in the plant the nature of the leaf is part of a 
<A NAME="61"></A>nature which has not perception or reason, and is subject to be impeded; 
<A NAME="62"></A>but the nature of man is part of a nature which is not subject to impediments, 
<A NAME="63"></A>and is intelligent and just, since it gives to everything in equal portions 
<A NAME="64"></A>and according to its worth, times, substance, cause (form), activity, and 
<A NAME="65"></A>incident. But examine, not to discover that any one thing compared with 
<A NAME="66"></A>any other single thing is equal in all respects, but by taking all the 
<A NAME="67"></A>parts together of one thing and comparing them with all the parts together 
<A NAME="68"></A>of another.
<A NAME="69"></A><BR><BR>Thou hast not leisure or ability to read. But thou hast leisure 
<A NAME="70"></A>or ability to check arrogance: thou hast leisure to be superior to pleasure 
<A NAME="71"></A>and pain: thou hast leisure to be superior to love of fame, and not to 
<A NAME="72"></A>be vexed at stupid and ungrateful people, nay even to care for 
<A NAME="73"></A>them.
<A NAME="74"></A><BR><BR>Let no man any longer hear thee finding fault with the court life 
<A NAME="75"></A>or with thy own.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR>Repentance is a kind of self-reproof for having neglected something 
<A NAME="77"></A>useful; but that which is good must be something useful, and the perfect 
<A NAME="78"></A>good man should look after it. But no such man would ever repent of having 
<A NAME="79"></A>refused any sensual pleasure. Pleasure then is neither good nor 
<A NAME="80"></A>useful.
<A NAME="81"></A><BR><BR>This thing, what is it in itself, in its own constitution? What 
<A NAME="82"></A>is its substance and material? And what its causal nature (or form)? And 
<A NAME="83"></A>what is it doing in the world? And how long does it 
<A NAME="84"></A>subsist?
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>When thou risest from sleep with reluctance, remember that it is 
<A NAME="86"></A>according to thy constitution and according to human nature to perform 
<A NAME="87"></A>social acts, but sleeping is common also to irrational animals. But that 
<A NAME="88"></A>which is according to each individual's nature is also more peculiarly 
<A NAME="89"></A>its own, and more suitable to its nature, and indeed also more 
<A NAME="90"></A>agreeable.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR>Constantly and, if it be possible, on the occasion of every impression 
<A NAME="92"></A>on the soul, apply to it the principles of Physic, of Ethic, and of 
<A NAME="93"></A>Dialectic.
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR>Whatever man thou meetest with, immediately say to thyself: What 
<A NAME="95"></A>opinions has this man about good and bad? For if with respect to pleasure 
<A NAME="96"></A>and pain and the causes of each, and with respect to fame and ignominy, 
<A NAME="97"></A>death and life, he has such and such opinions, it will seem nothing wonderful 
<A NAME="98"></A>or strange to me, if he does such and such things; and I shall bear in 
<A NAME="99"></A>mind that he is compelled to do so.
<A NAME="100"></A><BR><BR>Remember that as it is a shame to be surprised if the fig-tree 
<A NAME="101"></A>produces figs, so it is to be surprised if the world produces such and 
<A NAME="102"></A>such things of which it is productive; and for the physician and the helmsman 
<A NAME="103"></A>it is a shame to be surprised, if a man has a fever, or if the wind is 
<A NAME="104"></A>unfavourable.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR>Remember that to change thy opinion and to follow him who corrects 
<A NAME="106"></A>thy error is as consistent with freedom as it is to persist in thy error. 
<A NAME="107"></A>For it is thy own, the activity which is exerted according to thy own movement 
<A NAME="108"></A>and judgement, and indeed according to thy own understanding 
<A NAME="109"></A>too.
<A NAME="110"></A><BR><BR>If a thing is in thy own power, why dost thou do it? But if it 
<A NAME="111"></A>is in the power of another, whom dost thou blame? The atoms (chance) or 
<A NAME="112"></A>the gods? Both are foolish. Thou must blame nobody. For if thou canst, 
<A NAME="113"></A>correct that which is the cause; but if thou canst not do this, correct 
<A NAME="114"></A>at least the thing itself; but if thou canst not do even this, of what 
<A NAME="115"></A>use is it to thee to find fault? For nothing should be done without a 
<A NAME="116"></A>purpose.
<A NAME="117"></A><BR><BR>That which has died falls not out of the universe. If it stays 
<A NAME="118"></A>here, it also changes here, and is dissolved into its proper parts, which 
<A NAME="119"></A>are elements of the universe and of thyself. And these too change, and 
<A NAME="120"></A>they murmur not.
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR>Everything exists for some end, a horse, a vine. Why dost thou 
<A NAME="122"></A>wonder? Even the sun will say, I am for some purpose, and the rest of the 
<A NAME="123"></A>gods will say the same. For what purpose then art thou? to enjoy pleasure? 
<A NAME="124"></A>See if common sense allows this.
<A NAME="125"></A><BR><BR>Nature has had regard in everything no less to the end than to 
<A NAME="126"></A>the beginning and the continuance, just like the man who throws up a ball. 
<A NAME="127"></A>What good is it then for the ball to be thrown up, or harm for it to come 
<A NAME="128"></A>down, or even to have fallen? And what good is it to the bubble while it 
<A NAME="129"></A>holds together, or what harm when it is burst? The same may be said of 
<A NAME="130"></A>a light also.
<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR>Turn it (the body) inside out, and see what kind of thing it is; 
<A NAME="132"></A>and when it has grown old, what kind of thing it becomes, and when it is 
<A NAME="133"></A>diseased.
<A NAME="134"></A><BR><BR>Short-lived are both the praiser and the praised, and the rememberer 
<A NAME="135"></A>and the remembered: and all this in a nook of this part of the world; and 
<A NAME="136"></A>not even here do all agree, no, not any one with himself: and the whole 
<A NAME="137"></A>earth too is a point.
<A NAME="138"></A><BR><BR>Attend to the matter which is before thee, whether it is an opinion 
<A NAME="139"></A>or an act or a word.
<A NAME="140"></A><BR><BR>Thou sufferest this justly: for thou choosest rather to become 
<A NAME="141"></A>good to-morrow than to be good to-day.
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR>Am I doing anything? I do it with reference to the good of mankind. 
<A NAME="143"></A>Does anything happen to me? I receive it and refer it to the gods, and 
<A NAME="144"></A>the source of all things, from which all that happens is 
<A NAME="145"></A>derived.
<A NAME="146"></A><BR><BR>Such as bathing appears to thee- oil, sweat, dirt, filthy water, 
<A NAME="147"></A>all things disgusting- so is every part of life and 
<A NAME="148"></A>everything.
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR>Lucilla saw Verus die, and then Lucilla died. Secunda saw Maximus 
<A NAME="150"></A>die, and then Secunda died. Epitynchanus saw Diotimus die, and Epitynchanus 
<A NAME="151"></A>died. Antoninus saw Faustina die, and then Antoninus died. Such is everything. 
<A NAME="152"></A>Celer saw Hadrian die, and then Celer died. And those sharp-witted men, 
<A NAME="153"></A>either seers or men inflated with pride, where are they? For instance the 
<A NAME="154"></A>sharp-witted men, Charax and Demetrius the Platonist and Eudaemon, and 
<A NAME="155"></A>any one else like them. All ephemeral, dead long ago. Some indeed have 
<A NAME="156"></A>not been remembered even for a short time, and others have become the heroes 
<A NAME="157"></A>of fables, and again others have disappeared even from fables. Remember 
<A NAME="158"></A>this then, that this little compound, thyself, must either be dissolved, 
<A NAME="159"></A>or thy poor breath must be extinguished, or be removed and placed 
<A NAME="160"></A>elsewhere.
<A NAME="161"></A><BR><BR>It is satisfaction to a man to do the proper works of a man. Now 
<A NAME="162"></A>it is a proper work of a man to be benevolent to his own kind, to despise 
<A NAME="163"></A>the movements of the senses, to form a just judgement of plausible appearances, 
<A NAME="164"></A>and to take a survey of the nature of the universe and of the things which 
<A NAME="165"></A>happen in it.
<A NAME="166"></A><BR><BR>There are three relations between thee and other things: the one 
<A NAME="167"></A>to the body which surrounds thee; the second to the divine cause from which 
<A NAME="168"></A>all things come to all; and the third to those who live with 
<A NAME="169"></A>thee.
<A NAME="170"></A><BR><BR>Pain is either an evil to the body- then let the body say what 
<A NAME="171"></A>it thinks of it- or to the soul; but it is in the power of the soul to 
<A NAME="172"></A>maintain its own serenity and tranquility, and not to think that pain is 
<A NAME="173"></A>an evil. For every judgement and movement and desire and aversion is within, 
<A NAME="174"></A>and no evil ascends so high.
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR>Wipe out thy imaginations by often saying to thyself: now it is 
<A NAME="176"></A>in my power to let no badness be in this soul, nor desire nor any perturbation 
<A NAME="177"></A>at all; but looking at all things I see what is their nature, and I use 
<A NAME="178"></A>each according to its value.- Remember this power which thou hast from 
<A NAME="179"></A>nature.
<A NAME="180"></A><BR><BR>Speak both in the senate and to every man, whoever he may be, appropriately, 
<A NAME="181"></A>not with any affectation: use plain discourse.
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>Augustus' court, wife, daughter, descendants, ancestors, sister, 
<A NAME="183"></A>Agrippa, kinsmen, intimates, friends, Areius, Maecenas, physicians and 
<A NAME="184"></A>sacrificing priests- the whole court is dead. Then turn to the rest, not 
<A NAME="185"></A>considering the death of a single man, but of a whole race, as of the Pompeii; 
<A NAME="186"></A>and that which is inscribed on the tombs- The last of his race. Then consider 
<A NAME="187"></A>what trouble those before them have had that they might leave a successor; 
<A NAME="188"></A>and then, that of necessity some one must be the last. Again here consider 
<A NAME="189"></A>the death of a whole race.
<A NAME="190"></A><BR><BR>It is thy duty to order thy life well in every single act; and 
<A NAME="191"></A>if every act does its duty, as far as is possible, be content; and no one 
<A NAME="192"></A>is able to hinder thee so that each act shall not do its duty.- But something 
<A NAME="193"></A>external will stand in the way.- Nothing will stand in the way of thy acting 
<A NAME="194"></A>justly and soberly and considerately.- But perhaps some other active power 
<A NAME="195"></A>will be hindered.- Well, but by acquiescing in the hindrance and by being 
<A NAME="196"></A>content to transfer thy efforts to that which is allowed, another opportunity 
<A NAME="197"></A>of action is immediately put before thee in place of that which was hindered, 
<A NAME="198"></A>and one which will adapt itself to this ordering of which we are 
<A NAME="199"></A>speaking.
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR>Receive wealth or prosperity without arrogance; and be ready to 
<A NAME="201"></A>let it go.
<A NAME="202"></A><BR><BR>If thou didst ever see a hand cut off, or a foot, or a head, lying 
<A NAME="203"></A>anywhere apart from the rest of the body, such does a man make himself, 
<A NAME="204"></A>as far as he can, who is not content with what happens, and separates himself 
<A NAME="205"></A>from others, or does anything unsocial. Suppose that thou hast detached 
<A NAME="206"></A>thyself from the natural unity- for thou wast made by nature a part, but 
<A NAME="207"></A>now thou hast cut thyself off- yet here there is this beautiful provision, 
<A NAME="208"></A>that it is in thy power again to unite thyself. God has allowed this to 
<A NAME="209"></A>no other part, after it has been separated and cut asunder, to come together 
<A NAME="210"></A>again. But consider the kindness by which he has distinguished man, for 
<A NAME="211"></A>he has put it in his power not to be separated at all from the universal; 
<A NAME="212"></A>and when he has been separated, he has allowed him to return and to be 
<A NAME="213"></A>united and to resume his place as a part.
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR>As the nature of the universal has given to every rational being 
<A NAME="215"></A>all the other powers that it has, so we have received from it this power 
<A NAME="216"></A>also. For as the universal nature converts and fixes in its predestined 
<A NAME="217"></A>place everything which stands in the way and opposes it, and makes such 
<A NAME="218"></A>things a part of itself, so also the rational animal is able to make every 
<A NAME="219"></A>hindrance its own material, and to use it for such purposes as it may have 
<A NAME="220"></A>designed.
<A NAME="221"></A><BR><BR>Do not disturb thyself by thinking of the whole of thy life. Let 
<A NAME="222"></A>not thy thoughts at once embrace all the various troubles which thou mayest 
<A NAME="223"></A>expect to befall thee: but on every occasion ask thyself, What is there 
<A NAME="224"></A>in this which is intolerable and past bearing? For thou wilt be ashamed 
<A NAME="225"></A>to confess. In the next place remember that neither the future nor the 
<A NAME="226"></A>past pains thee, but only the present. But this is reduced to a very little, 
<A NAME="227"></A>if thou only circumscribest it, and chidest thy mind, if it is unable to 
<A NAME="228"></A>hold out against even this.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR><BR>Does Panthea or Pergamus now sit by the tomb of Verus? Does Chaurias 
<A NAME="230"></A>or Diotimus sit by the tomb of Hadrian? That would be ridiculous. Well, 
<A NAME="231"></A>suppose they did sit there, would the dead be conscious of it? And if the 
<A NAME="232"></A>dead were conscious, would they be pleased? And if they were pleased, would 
<A NAME="233"></A>that make them immortal? Was it not in the order of destiny that these 
<A NAME="234"></A>persons too should first become old women and old men and then die? What 
<A NAME="235"></A>then would those do after these were dead? All this is foul smell and blood 
<A NAME="236"></A>in a bag.
<A NAME="237"></A><BR><BR>If thou canst see sharp, look and judge wisely, says the 
<A NAME="238"></A>philosopher.
<A NAME="239"></A><BR><BR>In the constitution of the rational animal I see no virtue which 
<A NAME="240"></A>is opposed to justice; but I see a virtue which is opposed to love of pleasure, 
<A NAME="241"></A>and that is temperance.
<A NAME="242"></A><BR><BR>If thou takest away thy opinion about that which appears to give 
<A NAME="243"></A>thee pain, thou thyself standest in perfect security.- Who is this self?- 
<A NAME="244"></A>The reason.- But I am not reason.- Be it so. Let then the reason itself 
<A NAME="245"></A>not trouble itself. But if any other part of thee suffers, let it have 
<A NAME="246"></A>its own opinion about itself.
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR>Hindrance to the perceptions of sense is an evil to the animal 
<A NAME="248"></A>nature. Hindrance to the movements (desires) is equally an evil to the 
<A NAME="249"></A>animal nature. And something else also is equally an impediment and an 
<A NAME="250"></A>evil to the constitution of plants. So then that which is a hindrance to 
<A NAME="251"></A>the intelligence is an evil to the intelligent nature. Apply all these 
<A NAME="252"></A>things then to thyself. Does pain or sensuous pleasure affect thee? The 
<A NAME="253"></A>senses will look to that.- Has any obstacle opposed thee in thy efforts 
<A NAME="254"></A>towards an object? if indeed thou wast making this effort absolutely (unconditionally, 
<A NAME="255"></A>or without any reservation), certainly this obstacle is an evil to thee 
<A NAME="256"></A>considered as a rational animal. But if thou takest into consideration 
<A NAME="257"></A>the usual course of things, thou hast not yet been injured nor even impeded. 
<A NAME="258"></A>The things however which are proper to the understanding no other man is 
<A NAME="259"></A>used to impede, for neither fire, nor iron, nor tyrant, nor abuse, touches 
<A NAME="260"></A>it in any way. When it has been made a sphere, it continues a 
<A NAME="261"></A>sphere.
<A NAME="262"></A><BR><BR>It is not fit that I should give myself pain, for I have never 
<A NAME="263"></A>intentionally given pain even to another.
<A NAME="264"></A><BR><BR>Different things delight different people. But it is my delight 
<A NAME="265"></A>to keep the ruling faculty sound without turning away either from any man 
<A NAME="266"></A>or from any of the things which happen to men, but looking at and receiving 
<A NAME="267"></A>all with welcome eyes and using everything according to its 
<A NAME="268"></A>value.
<A NAME="269"></A><BR><BR>See that thou secure this present time to thyself: for those who 
<A NAME="270"></A>rather pursue posthumous fame do consider that the men of after time will 
<A NAME="271"></A>be exactly such as these whom they cannot bear now; and both are mortal. 
<A NAME="272"></A>And what is it in any way to thee if these men of after time utter this 
<A NAME="273"></A>or that sound, or have this or that opinion about thee?
<A NAME="274"></A><BR><BR>Take me and cast me where thou wilt; for there I shall keep my 
<A NAME="275"></A>divine part tranquil, that is, content, if it can feel and act conformably 
<A NAME="276"></A>to its proper constitution. Is this change of place sufficient reason why 
<A NAME="277"></A>my soul should be unhappy and worse than it was, depressed, expanded, shrinking, 
<A NAME="278"></A>affrighted? And what wilt thou find which is sufficient reason for 
<A NAME="279"></A>this?
<A NAME="280"></A><BR><BR>Nothing can happen to any man which is not a human accident, nor 
<A NAME="281"></A>to an ox which is not according to the nature of an ox, nor to a vine which 
<A NAME="282"></A>is not according to the nature of a vine, nor to a stone which is not proper 
<A NAME="283"></A>to a stone. If then there happens to each thing both what is usual and 
<A NAME="284"></A>natural, why shouldst thou complain? For the common nature brings nothing 
<A NAME="285"></A>which may not be borne by thee.
<A NAME="286"></A><BR><BR>If thou art pained by any external thing, it is not this thing 
<A NAME="287"></A>that disturbs thee, but thy own judgement about it. And it is in thy power 
<A NAME="288"></A>to wipe out this judgement now. But if anything in thy own disposition 
<A NAME="289"></A>gives thee pain, who hinders thee from correcting thy opinion? And even 
<A NAME="290"></A>if thou art pained because thou art not doing some particular thing which 
<A NAME="291"></A>seems to thee to be right, why dost thou not rather act than complain?- 
<A NAME="292"></A>But some insuperable obstacle is in the way?- Do not be grieved then, for 
<A NAME="293"></A>the cause of its not being done depends not on thee.- But it is not worth 
<A NAME="294"></A>while to live if this cannot be done.- Take thy departure then from life 
<A NAME="295"></A>contentedly, just as he dies who is in full activity, and well pleased 
<A NAME="296"></A>too with the things which are obstacles.
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR>Remember that the ruling faculty is invincible, when self-collected 
<A NAME="298"></A>it is satisfied with itself, if it does nothing which it does not choose 
<A NAME="299"></A>to do, even if it resist from mere obstinacy. What then will it be when 
<A NAME="300"></A>it forms a judgement about anything aided by reason and deliberately? Therefore 
<A NAME="301"></A>the mind which is free from passions is a citadel, for man has nothing 
<A NAME="302"></A>more secure to which he can fly for, refuge and for the future be inexpugnable. 
<A NAME="303"></A>He then who has not seen this is an ignorant man; but he who has seen it 
<A NAME="304"></A>and does not fly to this refuge is unhappy.
<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR>Say nothing more to thyself than what the first appearances report. 
<A NAME="306"></A>Suppose that it has been reported to thee that a certain person speaks 
<A NAME="307"></A>ill of thee. This has been reported; but that thou hast been injured, that 
<A NAME="308"></A>has not been reported. I see that my child is sick. I do see; but that 
<A NAME="309"></A>he is in danger, I do not see. Thus then always abide by the first appearances, 
<A NAME="310"></A>and add nothing thyself from within, and then nothing happens to thee. 
<A NAME="311"></A>Or rather add something, like a man who knows everything that happens in 
<A NAME="312"></A>the world.
<A NAME="313"></A><BR><BR>A cucumber is bitter.- Throw it away.- There are briars in the 
<A NAME="314"></A>road.- Turn aside from them.- This is enough. Do not add, And why were 
<A NAME="315"></A>such things made in the world? For thou wilt be ridiculed by a man who 
<A NAME="316"></A>is acquainted with nature, as thou wouldst be ridiculed by a carpenter 
<A NAME="317"></A>and shoemaker if thou didst find fault because thou seest in their workshop 
<A NAME="318"></A>shavings and cuttings from the things which they make. And yet they have 
<A NAME="319"></A>places into which they can throw these shavings and cuttings, and the universal 
<A NAME="320"></A>nature has no external space; but the wondrous part of her art is that 
<A NAME="321"></A>though she has circumscribed herself, everything within her which appears 
<A NAME="322"></A>to decay and to grow old and to be useless she changes into herself, and 
<A NAME="323"></A>again makes other new things from these very same, so that she requires 
<A NAME="324"></A>neither substance from without nor wants a place into which she may cast 
<A NAME="325"></A>that which decays. She is content then with her own space, and her own 
<A NAME="326"></A>matter and her own art.
<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR>Neither in thy actions be sluggish nor in thy conversation without 
<A NAME="328"></A>method, nor wandering in thy thoughts, nor let there be in thy soul inward 
<A NAME="329"></A>contention nor external effusion, nor in life be so busy as to have no 
<A NAME="330"></A>leisure.
<A NAME="331"></A><BR><BR>Suppose that men kill thee, cut thee in pieces, curse thee. What 
<A NAME="332"></A>then can these things do to prevent thy mind from remaining pure, wise, 
<A NAME="333"></A>sober, just? For instance, if a man should stand by a limpid pure spring, 
<A NAME="334"></A>and curse it, the spring never ceases sending up potable water; and if 
<A NAME="335"></A>he should cast clay into it or filth, it will speedily disperse them and 
<A NAME="336"></A>wash them out, and will not be at all polluted. How then shalt thou possess 
<A NAME="337"></A>a perpetual fountain and not a mere well? By forming thyself hourly to 
<A NAME="338"></A>freedom conjoined with contentment, simplicity and modesty.
<A NAME="339"></A><BR><BR>He who does not know what the world is, does not know where he 
<A NAME="340"></A>is. And he who does not know for what purpose the world exists, does not 
<A NAME="341"></A>know who he is, nor what the world is. But he who has failed in any one 
<A NAME="342"></A>of these things could not even say for what purpose he exists himself. 
<A NAME="343"></A>What then dost thou think of him who avoids or seeks the praise of those 
<A NAME="344"></A>who applaud, of men who know not either where they are or who they 
<A NAME="345"></A>are?
<A NAME="346"></A><BR><BR>Dost thou wish to be praised by a man who curses himself thrice 
<A NAME="347"></A>every hour? Wouldst thou wish to please a man who does not please himself? 
<A NAME="348"></A>Does a man please himself who repents of nearly everything that he 
<A NAME="349"></A>does?
<A NAME="350"></A><BR><BR>No longer let thy breathing only act in concert with the air which 
<A NAME="351"></A>surrounds thee, but let thy intelligence also now be in harmony with the 
<A NAME="352"></A>intelligence which embraces all things. For the intelligent power is no 
<A NAME="353"></A>less diffused in all parts and pervades all things for him who is willing 
<A NAME="354"></A>to draw it to him than the aerial power for him who is able to respire 
<A NAME="355"></A>it.
<A NAME="356"></A><BR><BR>Generally, wickedness does no harm at all to the universe; and 
<A NAME="357"></A>particularly, the wickedness of one man does no harm to another. It is 
<A NAME="358"></A>only harmful to him who has it in his power to be released from it, as 
<A NAME="359"></A>soon as he shall choose.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR>To my own free will the free will of my neighbour is just as indifferent 
<A NAME="361"></A>as his poor breath and flesh. For though we are made especially for the 
<A NAME="362"></A>sake of one another, still the ruling power of each of us has its own office, 
<A NAME="363"></A>for otherwise my neighbour's wickedness would be my harm, which God has 
<A NAME="364"></A>not willed in order that my unhappiness may not depend on 
<A NAME="365"></A>another.
<A NAME="366"></A><BR><BR>The sun appears to be poured down, and in all directions indeed 
<A NAME="367"></A>it is diffused, yet it is not effused. For this diffusion is extension: 
<A NAME="368"></A>Accordingly its rays are called Extensions [aktines] because they are extended 
<A NAME="369"></A>[apo tou ekteinesthai]. But one may judge what kind of a thing a ray is, 
<A NAME="370"></A>if he looks at the sun's light passing through a narrow opening into a 
<A NAME="371"></A>darkened room, for it is extended in a right line, and as it were is divided 
<A NAME="372"></A>when it meets with any solid body which stands in the way and intercepts 
<A NAME="373"></A>the air beyond; but there the light remains fixed and does not glide or 
<A NAME="374"></A>fall off. Such then ought to be the out-pouring and diffusion of the understanding, 
<A NAME="375"></A>and it should in no way be an effusion, but an extension, and it should 
<A NAME="376"></A>make no violent or impetuous collision with the obstacles which are in 
<A NAME="377"></A>its way; nor yet fall down, but be fixed and enlighten that which receives 
<A NAME="378"></A>it. For a body will deprive itself of the illumination, if it does not 
<A NAME="379"></A>admit it.
<A NAME="380"></A><BR><BR>He who fears death either fears the loss of sensation or a different 
<A NAME="381"></A>kind of sensation. But if thou shalt have no sensation, neither wilt thou 
<A NAME="382"></A>feel any harm; and if thou shalt acquire another kind of sensation, thou 
<A NAME="383"></A>wilt be a different kind of living being and thou wilt not cease to 
<A NAME="384"></A>live.
<A NAME="385"></A><BR><BR>Men exist for the sake of one another. Teach them then or bear 
<A NAME="386"></A>with them.
<A NAME="387"></A><BR><BR>In one way an arrow moves, in another way the mind. The mind indeed, 
<A NAME="388"></A>both when it exercises caution and when it is employed about inquiry, moves 
<A NAME="389"></A>straight onward not the less, and to its object.
<A NAME="390"></A><BR><BR>Enter into every man's ruling faculty; and also let every other 
<A NAME="391"></A>man enter into thine.
