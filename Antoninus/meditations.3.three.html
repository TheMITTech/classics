<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>We ught to consider not only that our life is daily wasting away and a 
<A NAME="11"></A>smaller part of it is left, but another thing also must be taken into the 
<A NAME="12"></A>account, that if a man should live longer, it is quite uncertain whether 
<A NAME="13"></A>the understanding will still continue sufficient for the comprehension 
<A NAME="14"></A>of things, and retain the power of contemplation which strives to acquire 
<A NAME="15"></A>the knowledge of the divine and the human. For if he shall begin to fall 
<A NAME="16"></A>into dotage, perspiration and nutrition and imagination and appetite, and 
<A NAME="17"></A>whatever else there is of the kind, will not fail; but the power of making 
<A NAME="18"></A>use of ourselves, and filling up the measure of our duty, and clearly separating 
<A NAME="19"></A>all appearances, and considering whether a man should now depart from life, 
<A NAME="20"></A>and whatever else of the kind absolutely requires a disciplined reason, 
<A NAME="21"></A>all this is already extinguished. We must make haste then, not only because 
<A NAME="22"></A>we are daily nearer to death, but also because the conception of things 
<A NAME="23"></A>and the understanding of them cease first.
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR>We ought to observe also that even the things which follow after 
<A NAME="25"></A>the things which are produced according to nature contain something pleasing 
<A NAME="26"></A>and attractive. For instance, when bread is baked some parts are split 
<A NAME="27"></A>at the surface, and these parts which thus open, and have a certain fashion 
<A NAME="28"></A>contrary to the purpose of the baker's art, are beautiful in a manner, 
<A NAME="29"></A>and in a peculiar way excite a desire for eating. And again, figs, when 
<A NAME="30"></A>they are quite ripe, gape open; and in the ripe olives the very circumstance 
<A NAME="31"></A>of their being near to rottenness adds a peculiar beauty to the fruit. 
<A NAME="32"></A>And the ears of corn bending down, and the lion's eyebrows, and the foam 
<A NAME="33"></A>which flows from the mouth of wild boars, and many other things- though 
<A NAME="34"></A>they are far from being beautiful, if a man should examine them severally- 
<A NAME="35"></A>still, because they are consequent upon the things which are formed by 
<A NAME="36"></A>nature, help to adorn them, and they please the mind; so that if a man 
<A NAME="37"></A>should have a feeling and deeper insight with respect to the things which 
<A NAME="38"></A>are produced in the universe, there is hardly one of those which follow 
<A NAME="39"></A>by way of consequence which will not seem to him to be in a manner disposed 
<A NAME="40"></A>so as to give pleasure. And so he will see even the real gaping jaws of 
<A NAME="41"></A>wild beasts with no less pleasure than those which painters and sculptors 
<A NAME="42"></A>show by imitation; and in an old woman and an old man he will be able to 
<A NAME="43"></A>see a certain maturity and comeliness; and the attractive loveliness of 
<A NAME="44"></A>young persons he will be able to look on with chaste eyes; and many such 
<A NAME="45"></A>things will present themselves, not pleasing to every man, but to him only 
<A NAME="46"></A>who has become truly familiar with nature and her works.
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR>Hippocrates after curing many diseases himself fell sick and died. 
<A NAME="48"></A>The Chaldaei foretold the deaths of many, and then fate caught them too. 
<A NAME="49"></A>Alexander, and Pompeius, and Caius Caesar, after so often completely destroying 
<A NAME="50"></A>whole cities, and in battle cutting to pieces many ten thousands of cavalry 
<A NAME="51"></A>and infantry, themselves too at last departed from life. Heraclitus, after 
<A NAME="52"></A>so many speculations on the conflagration of the universe, was filled with 
<A NAME="53"></A>water internally and died smeared all over with mud. And lice destroyed 
<A NAME="54"></A>Democritus; and other lice killed Socrates. What means all this? Thou hast 
<A NAME="55"></A>embarked, thou hast made the voyage, thou art come to shore; get out. If 
<A NAME="56"></A>indeed to another life, there is no want of gods, not even there. But if 
<A NAME="57"></A>to a state without sensation, thou wilt cease to be held by pains and pleasures, 
<A NAME="58"></A>and to be a slave to the vessel, which is as much inferior as that which 
<A NAME="59"></A>serves it is superior: for the one is intelligence and deity; the other 
<A NAME="60"></A>is earth and corruption.
<A NAME="61"></A><BR><BR>Do not waste the remainder of thy life in thoughts about others, 
<A NAME="62"></A>when thou dost not refer thy thoughts to some object of common utility. 
<A NAME="63"></A>For thou losest the opportunity of doing something else when thou hast 
<A NAME="64"></A>such thoughts as these, What is such a person doing, and why, and what 
<A NAME="65"></A>is he saying, and what is he thinking of, and what is he contriving, and 
<A NAME="66"></A>whatever else of the kind makes us wander away from the observation of 
<A NAME="67"></A>our own ruling power. We ought then to check in the series of our thoughts 
<A NAME="68"></A>everything that is without a purpose and useless, but most of all the over-curious 
<A NAME="69"></A>feeling and the malignant; and a man should use himself to think of those 
<A NAME="70"></A>things only about which if one should suddenly ask, What hast thou now 
<A NAME="71"></A>in thy thoughts? With perfect openness thou mightest, immediately answer, 
<A NAME="72"></A>This or That; so that from thy words it should be plain that everything 
<A NAME="73"></A>in thee is simple and benevolent, and such as befits a social animal, and 
<A NAME="74"></A>one that cares not for thoughts about pleasure or sensual enjoyments at 
<A NAME="75"></A>all, nor has any rivalry or envy and suspicion, or anything else for which 
<A NAME="76"></A>thou wouldst blush if thou shouldst say that thou hadst it in thy mind. 
<A NAME="77"></A>For the man who is such and no longer delays being among the number of 
<A NAME="78"></A>the best, is like a priest and minister of the gods, using too the deity 
<A NAME="79"></A>which is planted within him, which makes the man uncontaminated by pleasure, 
<A NAME="80"></A>unharmed by any pain, untouched by any insult, feeling no wrong, a fighter 
<A NAME="81"></A>in the noblest fight, one who cannot be overpowered by any passion, dyed 
<A NAME="82"></A>deep with justice, accepting with all his soul everything which happens 
<A NAME="83"></A>and is assigned to him as his portion; and not often, nor yet without great 
<A NAME="84"></A>necessity and for the general interest, imagining what another says, or 
<A NAME="85"></A>does, or thinks. For it is only what belongs to himself that he makes the 
<A NAME="86"></A>matter for his activity; and he constantly thinks of that which is allotted 
<A NAME="87"></A>to himself out of the sum total of things, and he makes his own acts fair, 
<A NAME="88"></A>and he is persuaded that his own portion is good. For the lot which is 
<A NAME="89"></A>assigned to each man is carried along with him and carries him along with 
<A NAME="90"></A>it. And he remembers also that every rational animal is his kinsman, and 
<A NAME="91"></A>that to care for all men is according to man's nature; and a man should 
<A NAME="92"></A>hold on to the opinion not of all, but of those only who confessedly live 
<A NAME="93"></A>according to nature. But as to those who live not so, he always bears in 
<A NAME="94"></A>mind what kind of men they are both at home and from home, both by night 
<A NAME="95"></A>and by day, and what they are, and with what men they live an impure life. 
<A NAME="96"></A>Accordingly, he does not value at all the praise which comes from such 
<A NAME="97"></A>men, since they are not even satisfied with themselves.
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR>Labour not unwillingly, nor without regard to the common interest, 
<A NAME="99"></A>nor without due consideration, nor with distraction; nor let studied ornament 
<A NAME="100"></A>set off thy thoughts, and be not either a man of many words, or busy about 
<A NAME="101"></A>too many things. And further, let the deity which is in thee be the guardian 
<A NAME="102"></A>of a living being, manly and of ripe age, and engaged in matter political, 
<A NAME="103"></A>and a Roman, and a ruler, who has taken his post like a man waiting for 
<A NAME="104"></A>the signal which summons him from life, and ready to go, having need neither 
<A NAME="105"></A>of oath nor of any man's testimony. Be cheerful also, and seek not external 
<A NAME="106"></A>help nor the tranquility which others give. A man then must stand erect, 
<A NAME="107"></A>not be kept erect by others.
<A NAME="108"></A><BR><BR>If thou findest in human life anything better than justice, truth, 
<A NAME="109"></A>temperance, fortitude, and, in a word, anything better than thy own mind's 
<A NAME="110"></A>self-satisfaction in the things which it enables thee to do according to 
<A NAME="111"></A>right reason, and in the condition that is assigned to thee without thy 
<A NAME="112"></A>own choice; if, I say, thou seest anything better than this, turn to it 
<A NAME="113"></A>with all thy soul, and enjoy that which thou hast found to be the best. 
<A NAME="114"></A>But if nothing appears to be better than the deity which is planted in 
<A NAME="115"></A>thee, which has subjected to itself all thy appetites, and carefully examines 
<A NAME="116"></A>all the impressions, and, as Socrates said, has detached itself from the 
<A NAME="117"></A>persuasions of sense, and has submitted itself to the gods, and cares for 
<A NAME="118"></A>mankind; if thou findest everything else smaller and of less value than 
<A NAME="119"></A>this, give place to nothing else, for if thou dost once diverge and incline 
<A NAME="120"></A>to it, thou wilt no longer without distraction be able to give the preference 
<A NAME="121"></A>to that good thing which is thy proper possession and thy own; for it is 
<A NAME="122"></A>not right that anything of any other kind, such as praise from the many, 
<A NAME="123"></A>or power, or enjoyment of pleasure, should come into competition with that 
<A NAME="124"></A>which is rationally and politically or practically good. All these things, 
<A NAME="125"></A>even though they may seem to adapt themselves to the better things in a 
<A NAME="126"></A>small degree, obtain the superiority all at once, and carry us away. But 
<A NAME="127"></A>do thou, I say, simply and freely choose the better, and hold to it.- But 
<A NAME="128"></A>that which is useful is the better.- Well then, if it is useful to thee 
<A NAME="129"></A>as a rational being, keep to it; but if it is only useful to thee as an 
<A NAME="130"></A>animal, say so, and maintain thy judgement without arrogance: only take 
<A NAME="131"></A>care that thou makest the inquiry by a sure method.
<A NAME="132"></A><BR><BR>Never value anything as profitable to thyself which shall compel 
<A NAME="133"></A>thee to break thy promise, to lose thy self-respect, to hate any man, to 
<A NAME="134"></A>suspect, to curse, to act the hypocrite, to desire anything which needs 
<A NAME="135"></A>walls and curtains: for he who has preferred to everything intelligence 
<A NAME="136"></A>and daemon and the worship of its excellence, acts no tragic part, does 
<A NAME="137"></A>not groan, will not need either solitude or much company; and, what is 
<A NAME="138"></A>chief of all, he will live without either pursuing or flying from death; 
<A NAME="139"></A>but whether for a longer or a shorter time he shall have the soul inclosed 
<A NAME="140"></A>in the body, he cares not at all: for even if he must depart immediately, 
<A NAME="141"></A>he will go as readily as if he were going to do anything else which can 
<A NAME="142"></A>be done with decency and order; taking care of this only all through life, 
<A NAME="143"></A>that his thoughts turn not away from anything which belongs to an intelligent 
<A NAME="144"></A>animal and a member of a civil community.
<A NAME="145"></A><BR><BR>In the mind of one who is chastened and purified thou wilt find 
<A NAME="146"></A>no corrupt matter, nor impurity, nor any sore skinned over. Nor is his 
<A NAME="147"></A>life incomplete when fate overtakes him, as one may say of an actor who 
<A NAME="148"></A>leaves the stage before ending and finishing the play. Besides, there is 
<A NAME="149"></A>in him nothing servile, nor affected, nor too closely bound to other things, 
<A NAME="150"></A>nor yet detached from other things, nothing worthy of blame, nothing which 
<A NAME="151"></A>seeks a hiding-place.
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR>Reverence the faculty which produces opinion. On this faculty it 
<A NAME="153"></A>entirely depends whether there shall exist in thy ruling part any opinion 
<A NAME="154"></A>inconsistent with nature and the constitution of the rational animal. And 
<A NAME="155"></A>this faculty promises freedom from hasty judgement, and friendship towards 
<A NAME="156"></A>men, and obedience to the gods.
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR>Throwing away then all things, hold to these only which are few; 
<A NAME="158"></A>and besides bear in mind that every man lives only this present time, which 
<A NAME="159"></A>is an indivisible point, and that all the rest of his life is either past 
<A NAME="160"></A>or it is uncertain. Short then is the time which every man lives, and small 
<A NAME="161"></A>the nook of the earth where he lives; and short too the longest posthumous 
<A NAME="162"></A>fame, and even this only continued by a succession of poor human beings, 
<A NAME="163"></A>who will very soon die, and who know not even themselves, much less him 
<A NAME="164"></A>who died long ago.
<A NAME="165"></A><BR><BR>To the aids which have been mentioned let this one still be added:- 
<A NAME="166"></A>Make for thyself a definition or description of the thing which is presented 
<A NAME="167"></A>to thee, so as to see distinctly what kind of a thing it is in its substance, 
<A NAME="168"></A>in its nudity, in its complete entirety, and tell thyself its proper name, 
<A NAME="169"></A>and the names of the things of which it has been compounded, and into which 
<A NAME="170"></A>it will be resolved. For nothing is so productive of elevation of mind 
<A NAME="171"></A>as to be able to examine methodically and truly every object which is presented 
<A NAME="172"></A>to thee in life, and always to look at things so as to see at the same 
<A NAME="173"></A>time what kind of universe this is, and what kind of use everything performs 
<A NAME="174"></A>in it, and what value everything has with reference to the whole, and what 
<A NAME="175"></A>with reference to man, who is a citizen of the highest city, of which all 
<A NAME="176"></A>other cities are like families; what each thing is, and of what it is composed, 
<A NAME="177"></A>and how long it is the nature of this thing to endure which now makes an 
<A NAME="178"></A>impression on me, and what virtue I have need of with respect to it, such 
<A NAME="179"></A>as gentleness, manliness, truth, fidelity, simplicity, contentment, and 
<A NAME="180"></A>the rest. Wherefore, on every occasion a man should say: this comes from 
<A NAME="181"></A>God; and this is according to the apportionment and spinning of the thread 
<A NAME="182"></A>of destiny, and such-like coincidence and chance; and this is from one 
<A NAME="183"></A>of the same stock, and a kinsman and partner, one who knows not however 
<A NAME="184"></A>what is according to his nature. But I know; for this reason I behave towards 
<A NAME="185"></A>him according to the natural law of fellowship with benevolence and justice. 
<A NAME="186"></A>At the same time however in things indifferent I attempt to ascertain the 
<A NAME="187"></A>value of each.
<A NAME="188"></A><BR><BR>If thou workest at that which is before thee, following right reason 
<A NAME="189"></A>seriously, vigorously, calmly, without allowing anything else to distract 
<A NAME="190"></A>thee, but keeping thy divine part pure, as if thou shouldst be bound to 
<A NAME="191"></A>give it back immediately; if thou holdest to this, expecting nothing, fearing 
<A NAME="192"></A>nothing, but satisfied with thy present activity according to nature, and 
<A NAME="193"></A>with heroic truth in every word and sound which thou utterest, thou wilt 
<A NAME="194"></A>live happy. And there is no man who is able to prevent 
<A NAME="195"></A>this.
<A NAME="196"></A><BR><BR>As physicians have always their instruments and knives ready for 
<A NAME="197"></A>cases which suddenly require their skill, so do thou have principles ready 
<A NAME="198"></A>for the understanding of things divine and human, and for doing everything, 
<A NAME="199"></A>even the smallest, with a recollection of the bond which unites the divine 
<A NAME="200"></A>and human to one another. For neither wilt thou do anything well which 
<A NAME="201"></A>pertains to man without at the same time having a reference to things divine; 
<A NAME="202"></A>nor the contrary.
<A NAME="203"></A><BR><BR>No longer wander at hazard; for neither wilt thou read thy own 
<A NAME="204"></A>memoirs, nor the acts of the ancient Romans and Hellenes, and the selections 
<A NAME="205"></A>from books which thou wast reserving for thy old age. Hasten then to the 
<A NAME="206"></A>end which thou hast before thee, and throwing away idle hopes, come to 
<A NAME="207"></A>thy own aid, if thou carest at all for thyself, while it is in thy 
<A NAME="208"></A>power.
<A NAME="209"></A><BR><BR>They know not how many things are signified by the words stealing, 
<A NAME="210"></A>sowing, buying, keeping quiet, seeing what ought to be done; for this is 
<A NAME="211"></A>not effected by the eyes, but by another kind of vision.
<A NAME="212"></A><BR><BR>Body, soul, intelligence: to the body belong sensations, to the 
<A NAME="213"></A>soul appetites, to the intelligence principles. To receive the impressions 
<A NAME="214"></A>of forms by means of appearances belongs even to animals; to be pulled 
<A NAME="215"></A>by the strings of desire belongs both to wild beasts and to men who have 
<A NAME="216"></A>made themselves into women, and to a Phalaris and a Nero: and to have the 
<A NAME="217"></A>intelligence that guides to the things which appear suitable belongs also 
<A NAME="218"></A>to those who do not believe in the gods, and who betray their country, 
<A NAME="219"></A>and do their impure deeds when they have shut the doors. If then everything 
<A NAME="220"></A>else is common to all that I have mentioned, there remains that which is 
<A NAME="221"></A>peculiar to the good man, to be pleased and content with what happens, 
<A NAME="222"></A>and with the thread which is spun for him; and not to defile the divinity 
<A NAME="223"></A>which is planted in his breast, nor disturb it by a crowd of images, but 
<A NAME="224"></A>to preserve it tranquil, following it obediently as a god, neither saying 
<A NAME="225"></A>anything contrary to the truth, nor doing anything contrary to justice. 
<A NAME="226"></A>And if all men refuse to believe that he lives a simple, modest, and contented 
<A NAME="227"></A>life, he is neither angry with any of them, nor does he deviate from the 
<A NAME="228"></A>way which leads to the end of life, to which a man ought to come pure, 
<A NAME="229"></A>tranquil, ready to depart, and without any compulsion perfectly reconciled 
<A NAME="230"></A>to his lot.
