<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>These are the properties of the rational soul: it sees itself, analyses 
<A NAME="11"></A>itself, and makes itself such as it chooses; the fruit which it bears itself 
<A NAME="12"></A>enjoys- for the fruits of plants and that in animals which corresponds 
<A NAME="13"></A>to fruits others enjoy- it obtains its own end, wherever the limit of life 
<A NAME="14"></A>may be fixed. Not as in a dance and in a play and in such like things, 
<A NAME="15"></A>where the whole action is incomplete, if anything cuts it short; but in 
<A NAME="16"></A>every part and wherever it may be stopped, it makes what has been set before 
<A NAME="17"></A>it full and complete, so that it can say, I have what is my own. And further 
<A NAME="18"></A>it traverses the whole universe, and the surrounding vacuum, and surveys 
<A NAME="19"></A>its form, and it extends itself into the infinity of time, and embraces 
<A NAME="20"></A>and comprehends the periodical renovation of all things, and it comprehends 
<A NAME="21"></A>that those who come after us will see nothing new, nor have those before 
<A NAME="22"></A>us seen anything more, but in a manner he who is forty years old, if he 
<A NAME="23"></A>has any understanding at all, has seen by virtue of the uniformity that 
<A NAME="24"></A>prevails all things which have been and all that will be. This too is a 
<A NAME="25"></A>property of the rational soul, love of one's neighbour, and truth and modesty, 
<A NAME="26"></A>and to value nothing more more than itself, which is also the property 
<A NAME="27"></A>of Law. Thus then right reason differs not at all from the reason of 
<A NAME="28"></A>justice.
<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR>Thou wilt set little value on pleasing song and dancing and the 
<A NAME="30"></A>pancratium, if thou wilt distribute the melody of the voice into its several 
<A NAME="31"></A>sounds, and ask thyself as to each, if thou art mastered by this; for thou 
<A NAME="32"></A>wilt be prevented by shame from confessing it: and in the matter of dancing, 
<A NAME="33"></A>if at each movement and attitude thou wilt do the same; and the like also 
<A NAME="34"></A>in the matter of the pancratium. In all things, then, except virtue and 
<A NAME="35"></A>the acts of virtue, remember to apply thyself to their several parts, and 
<A NAME="36"></A>by this division to come to value them little: and apply this rule also 
<A NAME="37"></A>to thy whole life.
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR>What a soul that is which is ready, if at any moment it must be 
<A NAME="39"></A>separated from the body, and ready either to be extinguished or dispersed 
<A NAME="40"></A>or continue to exist; but so that this readiness comes from a man's own 
<A NAME="41"></A>judgement, not from mere obstinacy, as with the Christians, but considerately 
<A NAME="42"></A>and with dignity and in a way to persuade another, without tragic 
<A NAME="43"></A>show.
<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR>Have I done something for the general interest? Well then I have 
<A NAME="45"></A>had my reward. Let this always be present to thy mind, and never stop doing 
<A NAME="46"></A>such good.
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR>What is thy art? To be good. And how is this accomplished well 
<A NAME="48"></A>except by general principles, some about the nature of the universe, and 
<A NAME="49"></A>others about the proper constitution of man?
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR>At first tragedies were brought on the stage as means of reminding 
<A NAME="51"></A>men of the things which happen to them, and that it is according to nature 
<A NAME="52"></A>for things to happen so, and that, if you are delighted with what is shown 
<A NAME="53"></A>on the stage, you should not be troubled with that which takes place on 
<A NAME="54"></A>the larger stage. For you see that these things must be accomplished thus, 
<A NAME="55"></A>and that even they bear them who cry out "O Cithaeron." And, indeed, some 
<A NAME="56"></A>things are said well by the dramatic writers, of which kind is the following 
<A NAME="57"></A>especially:-
<A NAME="58"></A><BR><BR>Me and my children if the gods neglect,
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>This has its reason too. And again-
<A NAME="60"></A><BR><BR>We must not chale and fret at that which happens. 
<A NAME="61"></A>And
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR>Life's harvest reap like the wheat's fruitful ear. And other things 
<A NAME="63"></A>of the same kind.
<A NAME="64"></A><BR><BR>After tragedy the old comedy was introduced, which had a magisterial 
<A NAME="65"></A>freedom of speech, and by its very plainness of speaking was useful in 
<A NAME="66"></A>reminding men to beware of insolence; and for this purpose too Diogenes 
<A NAME="67"></A>used to take from these writers.
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR>But as to the middle comedy which came next, observe what it was, 
<A NAME="69"></A>and again, for what object the new comedy was introduced, which gradually 
<A NAME="70"></A>sunk down into a mere mimic artifice. That some good things are said even 
<A NAME="71"></A>by these writers, everybody knows: but the whole plan of such poetry and 
<A NAME="72"></A>dramaturgy, to what end does it look!
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>How plain does it appear that there is not another condition of 
<A NAME="74"></A>life so well suited for philosophising as this in which thou now happenest 
<A NAME="75"></A>to be.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR>A branch cut off from the adjacent branch must of necessity be 
<A NAME="77"></A>cut off from the whole tree also. So too a man when he is separated from 
<A NAME="78"></A>another man has fallen off from the whole social community. Now as to a 
<A NAME="79"></A>branch, another cuts it off, but a man by his own act separates himself 
<A NAME="80"></A>from his neighbour when he hates him and turns away from him, and he does 
<A NAME="81"></A>not know that he has at the same time cut himself off from the whole social 
<A NAME="82"></A>system. Yet he has this privilege certainly from Zeus who framed society, 
<A NAME="83"></A>for it is in our power to grow again to that which is near to us, and be 
<A NAME="84"></A>to come a part which helps to make up the whole. However, if it often happens, 
<A NAME="85"></A>this kind of separation, it makes it difficult for that which detaches 
<A NAME="86"></A>itself to be brought to unity and to be restored to its former condition. 
<A NAME="87"></A>Finally, the branch, which from the first grew together with the tree, 
<A NAME="88"></A>and has continued to have one life with it, is not like that which after 
<A NAME="89"></A>being cut off is then ingrafted, for this is something like what the gardeners 
<A NAME="90"></A>mean when they say that it grows with the rest of the tree, but that it 
<A NAME="91"></A>has not the same mind with it.
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR>As those who try to stand in thy way when thou art proceeding according 
<A NAME="93"></A>to right reason, will not be able to turn thee aside from thy proper action, 
<A NAME="94"></A>so neither let them drive thee from thy benevolent feelings towards them, 
<A NAME="95"></A>but be on thy guard equally in both matters, not only in the matter of 
<A NAME="96"></A>steady judgement and action, but also in the matter of gentleness towards 
<A NAME="97"></A>those who try to hinder or otherwise trouble thee. For this also is a weakness, 
<A NAME="98"></A>to be vexed at them, as well as to be diverted from thy course of action 
<A NAME="99"></A>and to give way through fear; for both are equally deserters from their 
<A NAME="100"></A>post, the man who does it through fear, and the man who is alienated from 
<A NAME="101"></A>him who is by nature a kinsman and a friend.
<A NAME="102"></A><BR><BR>There is no nature which is inferior to art, for the arts imitate 
<A NAME="103"></A>the nature of things. But if this is so, that nature which is the most 
<A NAME="104"></A>perfect and the most comprehensive of all natures, cannot fall short of 
<A NAME="105"></A>the skill of art. Now all arts do the inferior things for the sake of the 
<A NAME="106"></A>superior; therefore the universal nature does so too. And, indeed, hence 
<A NAME="107"></A>is the origin of justice, and in justice the other virtues have their foundation: 
<A NAME="108"></A>for justice will not be observed, if we either care for middle things (things 
<A NAME="109"></A>indifferent), or are easily deceived and careless and 
<A NAME="110"></A>changeable.
<A NAME="111"></A><BR><BR>If the things do not come to thee, the pursuits and avoidances 
<A NAME="112"></A>of which disturb thee, still in a manner thou goest to them. Let then thy 
<A NAME="113"></A>judgement about them be at rest, and they will remain quiet, and thou wilt 
<A NAME="114"></A>not be seen either pursuing or avoiding.
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR>The spherical form of the soul maintains its figure, when it is 
<A NAME="116"></A>neither extended towards any object, nor contracted inwards, nor dispersed 
<A NAME="117"></A>nor sinks down, but is illuminated by light, by which it sees the truth, 
<A NAME="118"></A>the truth of all things and the truth that is in itself.
<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR>Suppose any man shall despise me. Let him look to that himself. 
<A NAME="120"></A>But I will look to this, that I be not discovered doing or saying anything 
<A NAME="121"></A>deserving of contempt. Shall any man hate me? Let him look to it. But I 
<A NAME="122"></A>will be mild and benevolent towards every man, and ready to show even him 
<A NAME="123"></A>his mistake, not reproachfully, nor yet as making a display of my endurance, 
<A NAME="124"></A>but nobly and honestly, like the great Phocion, unless indeed he only assumed 
<A NAME="125"></A>it. For the interior parts ought to be such, and a man ought to be seen 
<A NAME="126"></A>by the gods neither dissatisfied with anything nor complaining. For what 
<A NAME="127"></A>evil is it to thee, if thou art now doing what is agreeable to thy own 
<A NAME="128"></A>nature, and art satisfied with that which at this moment is suitable to 
<A NAME="129"></A>the nature of the universe, since thou art a human being placed at thy 
<A NAME="130"></A>post in order that what is for the common advantage may be done in some 
<A NAME="131"></A>way?
<A NAME="132"></A><BR><BR>Men despise one another and flatter one another; and men wish to 
<A NAME="133"></A>raise themselves above one another, and crouch before one 
<A NAME="134"></A>another.
<A NAME="135"></A><BR><BR>How unsound and insincere is he who says, I have determined to 
<A NAME="136"></A>deal with thee in a fair way.- What art thou doing, man? There is no occasion 
<A NAME="137"></A>to give this notice. It will soon show itself by acts. The voice ought 
<A NAME="138"></A>to be plainly written on the forehead. Such as a man's character is, he 
<A NAME="139"></A>immediately shows it in his eyes, just as he who is beloved forthwith reads 
<A NAME="140"></A>everything in the eyes of lovers. The man who is honest and good ought 
<A NAME="141"></A>to be exactly like a man who smells strong, so that the bystander as soon 
<A NAME="142"></A>as he comes near him must smell whether he choose or not. But the affectation 
<A NAME="143"></A>of simplicity is like a crooked stick. Nothing is more disgraceful than 
<A NAME="144"></A>a wolfish friendship (false friendship). Avoid this most of all. The good 
<A NAME="145"></A>and simple and benevolent show all these things in the eyes, and there 
<A NAME="146"></A>is no mistaking.
<A NAME="147"></A><BR><BR>As to living in the best way, this power is in the soul, if it 
<A NAME="148"></A>be indifferent to things which are indifferent. And it will be indifferent, 
<A NAME="149"></A>if it looks on each of these things separately and all together, and if 
<A NAME="150"></A>it remembers that not one of them produces in us an opinion about itself, 
<A NAME="151"></A>nor comes to us; but these things remain immovable, and it is we ourselves 
<A NAME="152"></A>who produce the judgements about them, and, as we may say, write them in 
<A NAME="153"></A>ourselves, it being in our power not to write them, and it being in our 
<A NAME="154"></A>power, if perchance these judgements have imperceptibly got admission to 
<A NAME="155"></A>our minds, to wipe them out; and if we remember also that such attention 
<A NAME="156"></A>will only be for a short time, and then life will be at an end. Besides, 
<A NAME="157"></A>what trouble is there at all in doing this? For if these things are according 
<A NAME="158"></A>to nature, rejoice in them, and they will be easy to thee: but if contrary 
<A NAME="159"></A>to nature, seek what is conformable to thy own nature, and strive towards 
<A NAME="160"></A>this, even if it bring no reputation; for every man is allowed to seek 
<A NAME="161"></A>his own good.
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR>Consider whence each thing is come, and of what it consists, and 
<A NAME="163"></A>into what it changes, and what kind of a thing it will be when it has changed, 
<A NAME="164"></A>and that it will sustain no harm.
<A NAME="165"></A><BR><BR>If any have offended against thee, consider first: What is my relation 
<A NAME="166"></A>to men, and that we are made for one another; and in another respect, I 
<A NAME="167"></A>was made to be set over them, as a ram over the flock or a bull over the 
<A NAME="168"></A>herd. But examine the matter from first principles, from this: If all things 
<A NAME="169"></A>are not mere atoms, it is nature which orders all things: if this is so, 
<A NAME="170"></A>the inferior things exist for the sake of the superior, and these for the 
<A NAME="171"></A>sake of one another.
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR>Second, consider what kind of men they are at table, in bed, and 
<A NAME="173"></A>so forth: and particularly, under what compulsions in respect of opinions 
<A NAME="174"></A>they are; and as to their acts, consider with what pride they do what they 
<A NAME="175"></A>do.
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR>Third, that if men do rightly what they do, we ought not to be 
<A NAME="177"></A>displeased; but if they do not right, it is plain that they do so involuntarily 
<A NAME="178"></A>and in ignorance. For as every soul is unwillingly deprived of the truth, 
<A NAME="179"></A>so also is it unwillingly deprived of the power of behaving to each man 
<A NAME="180"></A>according to his deserts. Accordingly men are pained when they are called 
<A NAME="181"></A>unjust, ungrateful, and greedy, and in a word wrong-doers to their 
<A NAME="182"></A>neighbours.
<A NAME="183"></A><BR><BR>Fourth, consider that thou also doest many things wrong, and that 
<A NAME="184"></A>thou art a man like others; and even if thou dost abstain from certain 
<A NAME="185"></A>faults, still thou hast the disposition to commit them, though either through 
<A NAME="186"></A>cowardice, or concern about reputation, or some such mean motive, thou 
<A NAME="187"></A>dost abstain from such faults.
<A NAME="188"></A><BR><BR>Fifth, consider that thou dost not even understand whether men 
<A NAME="189"></A>are doing wrong or not, for many things are done with a certain reference 
<A NAME="190"></A>to circumstances. And in short, a man must learn a great deal to enable 
<A NAME="191"></A>him to pass a correct judgement on another man's acts.
<A NAME="192"></A><BR><BR>Sixth, consider when thou art much vexed or grieved, that man's 
<A NAME="193"></A>life is only a moment, and after a short time we are all laid out 
<A NAME="194"></A>dead.
<A NAME="195"></A><BR><BR>Seventh, that it is not men's acts which disturb us, for those 
<A NAME="196"></A>acts have their foundation in men's ruling principles, but it is our own 
<A NAME="197"></A>opinions which disturb us. Take away these opinions then, and resolve to 
<A NAME="198"></A>dismiss thy judgement about an act as if it were something grievous, and 
<A NAME="199"></A>thy anger is gone. How then shall I take away these opinions? By reflecting 
<A NAME="200"></A>that no wrongful act of another brings shame on thee: for unless that which 
<A NAME="201"></A>is shameful is alone bad, thou also must of necessity do many things wrong, 
<A NAME="202"></A>and become a robber and everything else.
<A NAME="203"></A><BR><BR>Eighth, consider how much more pain is brought on us by the anger 
<A NAME="204"></A>and vexation caused by such acts than by the acts themselves, at which 
<A NAME="205"></A>we are angry and vexed.
<A NAME="206"></A><BR><BR>Ninth, consider that a good disposition is invincible, if it be 
<A NAME="207"></A>genuine, and not an affected smile and acting a part. For what will the 
<A NAME="208"></A>most violent man do to thee, if thou continuest to be of a kind disposition 
<A NAME="209"></A>towards him, and if, as opportunity offers, thou gently admonishest him 
<A NAME="210"></A>and calmly correctest his errors at the very time when he is trying to 
<A NAME="211"></A>do thee harm, saying, Not so, my child: we are constituted by nature for 
<A NAME="212"></A>something else: I shall certainly not be injured, but thou art injuring 
<A NAME="213"></A>thyself, my child.- And show him with gentle tact and by general principles 
<A NAME="214"></A>that this is so, and that even bees do not do as he does, nor any animals 
<A NAME="215"></A>which are formed by nature to be gregarious. And thou must do this neither 
<A NAME="216"></A>with any double meaning nor in the way of reproach, but affectionately 
<A NAME="217"></A>and without any rancour in thy soul; and not as if thou wert lecturing 
<A NAME="218"></A>him, nor yet that any bystander may admire, but either when he is alone, 
<A NAME="219"></A>and if others are present...
<A NAME="220"></A><BR><BR>Remember these nine rules, as if thou hadst received them as a 
<A NAME="221"></A>gift from the Muses, and begin at last to be a man while thou livest. But 
<A NAME="222"></A>thou must equally avoid flattering men and being veied at them, for both 
<A NAME="223"></A>are unsocial and lead to harm. And let this truth be present to thee in 
<A NAME="224"></A>the excitement of anger, that to be moved by passion is not manly, but 
<A NAME="225"></A>that mildness and gentleness, as they are more agreeable to human nature, 
<A NAME="226"></A>so also are they more manly; and he who possesses these qualities possesses 
<A NAME="227"></A>strength, nerves and courage, and not the man who is subject to fits of 
<A NAME="228"></A>passion and discontent. For in the same degree in which a man's mind is 
<A NAME="229"></A>nearer to freedom from all passion, in the same degree also is it nearer 
<A NAME="230"></A>to strength: and as the sense of pain is a characteristic of weakness, 
<A NAME="231"></A>so also is anger. For he who yields to pain and he who yields to anger, 
<A NAME="232"></A>both are wounded and both submit.
<A NAME="233"></A><BR><BR>But if thou wilt, receive also a tenth present from the leader 
<A NAME="234"></A>of the Muses (Apollo), and it is this- that to expect bad men not to do 
<A NAME="235"></A>wrong is madness, for he who expects this desires an impossibility. But 
<A NAME="236"></A>to allow men to behave so to others, and to expect them not to do thee 
<A NAME="237"></A>any wrong, is irrational and tyrannical.
<A NAME="238"></A><BR><BR>There are four principal aberrations of the superior faculty against 
<A NAME="239"></A>which thou shouldst be constantly on thy guard, and when thou hast detected 
<A NAME="240"></A>them, thou shouldst wipe them out and say on each occasion thus: this thought 
<A NAME="241"></A>is not necessary: this tends to destroy social union: this which thou art 
<A NAME="242"></A>going to say comes not from the real thoughts; for thou shouldst consider 
<A NAME="243"></A>it among the most absurd of things for a man not to speak from his real 
<A NAME="244"></A>thoughts. But the fourth is when thou shalt reproach thyself for anything, 
<A NAME="245"></A>for this is an evidence of the diviner part within thee being overpowered 
<A NAME="246"></A>and yielding to the less honourable and to the perishable part, the body, 
<A NAME="247"></A>and to its gross pleasures.
<A NAME="248"></A><BR><BR>Thy aerial part and all the fiery parts which are mingled in thee, 
<A NAME="249"></A>though by nature they have an upward tendency, still in obedience to the 
<A NAME="250"></A>disposition of the universe they are overpowered here in the compound mass 
<A NAME="251"></A>(the body). And also the whole of the earthy part in thee and the watery, 
<A NAME="252"></A>though their tendency is downward, still are raised up and occupy a position 
<A NAME="253"></A>which is not their natural one. In this manner then the elemental parts 
<A NAME="254"></A>obey the universal, for when they have been fixed in any place perforce 
<A NAME="255"></A>they remain there until again the universal shall sound the signal for 
<A NAME="256"></A>dissolution. Is it not then strange that thy intelligent part only should 
<A NAME="257"></A>be disobedient and discontented with its own place? And yet no force is 
<A NAME="258"></A>imposed on it, but only those things which are conformable to its nature: 
<A NAME="259"></A>still it does not submit, but is carried in the opposite direction. For 
<A NAME="260"></A>the movement towards injustice and intemperance and to anger and grief 
<A NAME="261"></A>and fear is nothing else than the act of one who deviates from nature. 
<A NAME="262"></A>And also when the ruling faculty is discontented with anything that happens, 
<A NAME="263"></A>then too it deserts its post: for it is constituted for piety and reverence 
<A NAME="264"></A>towards the gods no less than for justice. For these qualities also are 
<A NAME="265"></A>comprehended under the generic term of contentment with the constitution 
<A NAME="266"></A>of things, and indeed they are prior to acts of justice.
<A NAME="267"></A><BR><BR>He who has not one and always the same object in life, cannot be 
<A NAME="268"></A>one and the same all through his life. But what I have said is not enough, 
<A NAME="269"></A>unless this also is added, what this object ought to be. For as there is 
<A NAME="270"></A>not the same opinion about all the things which in some way or other are 
<A NAME="271"></A>considered by the majority to be good, but only about some certain things, 
<A NAME="272"></A>that is, things which concern the common interest; so also ought we to 
<A NAME="273"></A>propose to ourselves an object which shall be of a common kind (social) 
<A NAME="274"></A>and political. For he who directs all his own efforts to this object, will 
<A NAME="275"></A>make all his acts alike, and thus will always be the 
<A NAME="276"></A>same.
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR>Think of the country mouse and of the town mouse, and of the alarm 
<A NAME="278"></A>and trepidation of the town mouse.
<A NAME="279"></A><BR><BR>Socrates used to call the opinions of the many by the name of Lamiae, 
<A NAME="280"></A>bugbears to frighten children.
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR>The Lacedaemonians at their public spectacles used to set seats 
<A NAME="282"></A>in the shade for strangers, but themselves sat down 
<A NAME="283"></A>anywhere.
<A NAME="284"></A><BR><BR>Socrates excused himself to Perdiccas for not going to him, saying, 
<A NAME="285"></A>It is because I would not perish by the worst of all ends, that is, I would 
<A NAME="286"></A>not receive a favour and then be unable to return it.
<A NAME="287"></A><BR><BR>In the writings of the Ephesians there was this precept, constantly 
<A NAME="288"></A>to think of some one of the men of former times who practised 
<A NAME="289"></A>virtue.
<A NAME="290"></A><BR><BR>The Pythagoreans bid us in the morning look to the heavens that 
<A NAME="291"></A>we may be reminded of those bodies which continually do the same things 
<A NAME="292"></A>and in the same manner perform their work, and also be reminded of their 
<A NAME="293"></A>purity and nudity. For there is no veil over a star.
<A NAME="294"></A><BR><BR>Consider what a man Socrates was when he dressed himself in a skin, 
<A NAME="295"></A>after Xanthippe had taken his cloak and gone out, and what Socrates said 
<A NAME="296"></A>to his friends who were ashamed of him and drew back from him when they 
<A NAME="297"></A>saw him dressed thus.
<A NAME="298"></A><BR><BR>Neither in writing nor in reading wilt thou be able to lay down 
<A NAME="299"></A>rules for others before thou shalt have first learned to obey rules thyself. 
<A NAME="300"></A>Much more is this so in life.
<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR>A slave thou art: free speech is not for thee.
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>And my heart laughed within.
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>And virtue they will curse, speaking harsh words.
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>To look for the fig in winter is a madman's act: such is he who looks 
<A NAME="305"></A>for his child when it is no longer allowed.
<A NAME="306"></A><BR><BR>When a man kisses his child, said Epictetus, he should whisper 
<A NAME="307"></A>to himself, "To-morrow perchance thou wilt die."- But those are words of 
<A NAME="308"></A>bad omen.- "No word is a word of bad omen," said Epictetus, "which expresses 
<A NAME="309"></A>any work of nature; or if it is so, it is also a word of bad omen to speak 
<A NAME="310"></A>of the ears of corn being reaped."
<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR>The unripe grape, the ripe bunch, the dried grape, all are changes, 
<A NAME="312"></A>not into nothing, but into something which exists not 
<A NAME="313"></A>yet.
<A NAME="314"></A><BR><BR>No man can rob us of our free will.
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>Epictetus also said, A man must discover an art (or rules) with respect 
<A NAME="316"></A>to giving his assent; and in respect to his movements he must be careful 
<A NAME="317"></A>that they be made with regard to circumstances, that they be consistent 
<A NAME="318"></A>with social interests, that they have regard to the value of the object; 
<A NAME="319"></A>and as to sensual desire, he should altogether keep away from it; and as 
<A NAME="320"></A>to avoidance (aversion) he should not show it with respect to any of the 
<A NAME="321"></A>things which are not in our power.
<A NAME="322"></A><BR><BR>The dispute then, he said, is not about any common matter, but 
<A NAME="323"></A>about being mad or not.
<A NAME="324"></A><BR><BR>Socrates used to say, What do you want? Souls of rational men or 
<A NAME="325"></A>irrational?- Souls of rational men.- Of what rational men? Sound or unsound?- 
<A NAME="326"></A>Sound.- Why then do you not seek for them?- Because we have them.- Why 
<A NAME="327"></A>then do you fight and quarrel?
