<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>From my grandfather Verus I learned good morals and the government of my 
<A NAME="11"></A>temper.
<A NAME="12"></A><BR><BR>From the reputation and remembrance of my father, modesty and a 
<A NAME="13"></A>manly character.
<A NAME="14"></A><BR><BR>From my mother, piety and beneficence, and abstinence, not only 
<A NAME="15"></A>from evil deeds, but even from evil thoughts; and further, simplicity in 
<A NAME="16"></A>my way of living, far removed from the habits of the 
<A NAME="17"></A>rich.
<A NAME="18"></A><BR><BR>From my great-grandfather, not to have frequented public schools, 
<A NAME="19"></A>and to have had good teachers at home, and to know that on such things 
<A NAME="20"></A>a man should spend liberally.
<A NAME="21"></A><BR><BR>From my governor, to be neither of the green nor of the blue party 
<A NAME="22"></A>at the games in the Circus, nor a partizan either of the Parmularius or 
<A NAME="23"></A>the Scutarius at the gladiators' fights; from him too I learned endurance 
<A NAME="24"></A>of labour, and to want little, and to work with my own hands, and not to 
<A NAME="25"></A>meddle with other people's affairs, and not to be ready to listen to 
<A NAME="26"></A>slander.
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR>From Diognetus, not to busy myself about trifling things, and not 
<A NAME="28"></A>to give credit to what was said by miracle-workers and jugglers about incantations 
<A NAME="29"></A>and the driving away of daemons and such things; and not to breed quails 
<A NAME="30"></A>for fighting, nor to give myself up passionately to such things; and to 
<A NAME="31"></A>endure freedom of speech; and to have become intimate with philosophy; 
<A NAME="32"></A>and to have been a hearer, first of Bacchius, then of Tandasis and Marcianus; 
<A NAME="33"></A>and to have written dialogues in my youth; and to have desired a plank 
<A NAME="34"></A>bed and skin, and whatever else of the kind belongs to the Grecian 
<A NAME="35"></A>discipline.
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR>From Rusticus I received the impression that my character required 
<A NAME="37"></A>improvement and discipline; and from him I learned not to be led astray 
<A NAME="38"></A>to sophistic emulation, nor to writing on speculative matters, nor to delivering 
<A NAME="39"></A>little hortatory orations, nor to showing myself off as a man who practises 
<A NAME="40"></A>much discipline, or does benevolent acts in order to make a display; and 
<A NAME="41"></A>to abstain from rhetoric, and poetry, and fine writing; and not to walk 
<A NAME="42"></A>about in the house in my outdoor dress, nor to do other things of the kind; 
<A NAME="43"></A>and to write my letters with simplicity, like the letter which Rusticus 
<A NAME="44"></A>wrote from Sinuessa to my mother; and with respect to those who have offended 
<A NAME="45"></A>me by words, or done me wrong, to be easily disposed to be pacified and 
<A NAME="46"></A>reconciled, as soon as they have shown a readiness to be reconciled; and 
<A NAME="47"></A>to read carefully, and not to be satisfied with a superficial understanding 
<A NAME="48"></A>of a book; nor hastily to give my assent to those who talk overmuch; and 
<A NAME="49"></A>I am indebted to him for being acquainted with the discourses of Epictetus, 
<A NAME="50"></A>which he communicated to me out of his own collection.
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR>From Apollonius I learned freedom of will and undeviating steadiness 
<A NAME="52"></A>of purpose; and to look to nothing else, not even for a moment, except 
<A NAME="53"></A>to reason; and to be always the same, in sharp pains, on the occasion of 
<A NAME="54"></A>the loss of a child, and in long illness; and to see clearly in a living 
<A NAME="55"></A>example that the same man can be both most resolute and yielding, and not 
<A NAME="56"></A>peevish in giving his instruction; and to have had before my eyes a man 
<A NAME="57"></A>who clearly considered his experience and his skill in expounding philosophical 
<A NAME="58"></A>principles as the smallest of his merits; and from him I learned how to 
<A NAME="59"></A>receive from friends what are esteemed favours, without being either humbled 
<A NAME="60"></A>by them or letting them pass unnoticed.
<A NAME="61"></A><BR><BR>From Sextus, a benevolent disposition, and the example of a family 
<A NAME="62"></A>governed in a fatherly manner, and the idea of living conformably to nature; 
<A NAME="63"></A>and gravity without affectation, and to look carefully after the interests 
<A NAME="64"></A>of friends, and to tolerate ignorant persons, and those who form opinions 
<A NAME="65"></A>without consideration: he had the power of readily accommodating himself 
<A NAME="66"></A>to all, so that intercourse with him was more agreeable than any flattery; 
<A NAME="67"></A>and at the same time he was most highly venerated by those who associated 
<A NAME="68"></A>with him: and he had the faculty both of discovering and ordering, in an 
<A NAME="69"></A>intelligent and methodical way, the principles necessary for life; and 
<A NAME="70"></A>he never showed anger or any other passion, but was entirely free from 
<A NAME="71"></A>passion, and also most affectionate; and he could express approbation without 
<A NAME="72"></A>noisy display, and he possessed much knowledge without 
<A NAME="73"></A>ostentation.
<A NAME="74"></A><BR><BR>From Alexander the grammarian, to refrain from fault-finding, and 
<A NAME="75"></A>not in a reproachful way to chide those who uttered any barbarous or solecistic 
<A NAME="76"></A>or strange-sounding expression; but dexterously to introduce the very expression 
<A NAME="77"></A>which ought to have been used, and in the way of answer or giving confirmation, 
<A NAME="78"></A>or joining in an inquiry about the thing itself, not about the word, or 
<A NAME="79"></A>by some other fit suggestion.
<A NAME="80"></A><BR><BR>From Fronto I learned to observe what envy, and duplicity, and 
<A NAME="81"></A>hypocrisy are in a tyrant, and that generally those among us who are called 
<A NAME="82"></A>Patricians are rather deficient in paternal affection.
<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR>From Alexander the Platonic, not frequently nor without necessity 
<A NAME="84"></A>to say to any one, or to write in a letter, that I have no leisure; nor 
<A NAME="85"></A>continually to excuse the neglect of duties required by our relation to 
<A NAME="86"></A>those with whom we live, by alleging urgent occupations.
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR>From Catulus, not to be indifferent when a friend finds fault, 
<A NAME="88"></A>even if he should find fault without reason, but to try to restore him 
<A NAME="89"></A>to his usual disposition; and to be ready to speak well of teachers, as 
<A NAME="90"></A>it is reported of Domitius and Athenodotus; and to love my children 
<A NAME="91"></A>truly.
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR>From my brother Severus, to love my kin, and to love truth, and 
<A NAME="93"></A>to love justice; and through him I learned to know Thrasea, Helvidius, 
<A NAME="94"></A>Cato, Dion, Brutus; and from him I received the idea of a polity in which 
<A NAME="95"></A>there is the same law for all, a polity administered with regard to equal 
<A NAME="96"></A>rights and equal freedom of speech, and the idea of a kingly government 
<A NAME="97"></A>which respects most of all the freedom of the governed; I learned from 
<A NAME="98"></A>him also consistency and undeviating steadiness in my regard for philosophy; 
<A NAME="99"></A>and a disposition to do good, and to give to others readily, and to cherish 
<A NAME="100"></A>good hopes, and to believe that I am loved by my friends; and in him I 
<A NAME="101"></A>observed no concealment of his opinions with respect to those whom he condemned, 
<A NAME="102"></A>and that his friends had no need to conjecture what he wished or did not 
<A NAME="103"></A>wish, but it was quite plain.
<A NAME="104"></A><BR><BR>From Maximus I learned self-government, and not to be led aside 
<A NAME="105"></A>by anything; and cheerfulness in all circumstances, as well as in illness; 
<A NAME="106"></A>and a just admixture in the moral character of sweetness and dignity, and 
<A NAME="107"></A>to do what was set before me without complaining. I observed that everybody 
<A NAME="108"></A>believed that he thought as he spoke, and that in all that he did he never 
<A NAME="109"></A>had any bad intention; and he never showed amazement and surprise, and 
<A NAME="110"></A>was never in a hurry, and never put off doing a thing, nor was perplexed 
<A NAME="111"></A>nor dejected, nor did he ever laugh to disguise his vexation, nor, on the 
<A NAME="112"></A>other hand, was he ever passionate or suspicious. He was accustomed to 
<A NAME="113"></A>do acts of beneficence, and was ready to forgive, and was free from all 
<A NAME="114"></A>falsehood; and he presented the appearance of a man who could not be diverted 
<A NAME="115"></A>from right rather than of a man who had been improved. I observed, too, 
<A NAME="116"></A>that no man could ever think that he was despised by Maximus, or ever venture 
<A NAME="117"></A>to think himself a better man. He had also the art of being humorous in 
<A NAME="118"></A>an agreeable way.
<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR>In my father I observed mildness of temper, and unchangeable resolution 
<A NAME="120"></A>in the things which he had determined after due deliberation; and no vainglory 
<A NAME="121"></A>in those things which men call honours; and a love of labour and perseverance; 
<A NAME="122"></A>and a readiness to listen to those who had anything to propose for the 
<A NAME="123"></A>common weal; and undeviating firmness in giving to every man according 
<A NAME="124"></A>to his deserts; and a knowledge derived from experience of the occasions 
<A NAME="125"></A>for vigorous action and for remission. And I observed that he had overcome 
<A NAME="126"></A>all passion for boys; and he considered himself no more than any other 
<A NAME="127"></A>citizen; and he released his friends from all obligation to sup with him 
<A NAME="128"></A>or to attend him of necessity when he went abroad, and those who had failed 
<A NAME="129"></A>to accompany him, by reason of any urgent circumstances, always found him 
<A NAME="130"></A>the same. I observed too his habit of careful inquiry in all matters of 
<A NAME="131"></A>deliberation, and his persistency, and that he never stopped his investigation 
<A NAME="132"></A>through being satisfied with appearances which first present themselves; 
<A NAME="133"></A>and that his disposition was to keep his friends, and not to be soon tired 
<A NAME="134"></A>of them, nor yet to be extravagant in his affection; and to be satisfied 
<A NAME="135"></A>on all occasions, and cheerful; and to foresee things a long way off, and 
<A NAME="136"></A>to provide for the smallest without display; and to check immediately popular 
<A NAME="137"></A>applause and all flattery; and to be ever watchful over the things which 
<A NAME="138"></A>were necessary for the administration of the empire, and to be a good manager 
<A NAME="139"></A>of the expenditure, and patiently to endure the blame which he got for 
<A NAME="140"></A>such conduct; and he was neither superstitious with respect to the gods, 
<A NAME="141"></A>nor did he court men by gifts or by trying to please them, or by flattering 
<A NAME="142"></A>the populace; but he showed sobriety in all things and firmness, and never 
<A NAME="143"></A>any mean thoughts or action, nor love of novelty. And the things which 
<A NAME="144"></A>conduce in any way to the commodity of life, and of which fortune gives 
<A NAME="145"></A>an abundant supply, he used without arrogance and without excusing himself; 
<A NAME="146"></A>so that when he had them, he enjoyed them without affectation, and when 
<A NAME="147"></A>he had them not, he did not want them. No one could ever say of him that 
<A NAME="148"></A>he was either a sophist or a home-bred flippant slave or a pedant; but 
<A NAME="149"></A>every one acknowledged him to be a man ripe, perfect, above flattery, able 
<A NAME="150"></A>to manage his own and other men's affairs. Besides this, he honoured those 
<A NAME="151"></A>who were true philosophers, and he did not reproach those who pretended 
<A NAME="152"></A>to be philosophers, nor yet was he easily led by them. He was also easy 
<A NAME="153"></A>in conversation, and he made himself agreeable without any offensive affectation. 
<A NAME="154"></A>He took a reasonable care of his body's health, not as one who was greatly 
<A NAME="155"></A>attached to life, nor out of regard to personal appearance, nor yet in 
<A NAME="156"></A>a careless way, but so that, through his own attention, he very seldom 
<A NAME="157"></A>stood in need of the physician's art or of medicine or external applications. 
<A NAME="158"></A>He was most ready to give way without envy to those who possessed any particular 
<A NAME="159"></A>faculty, such as that of eloquence or knowledge of the law or of morals, 
<A NAME="160"></A>or of anything else; and he gave them his help, that each might enjoy reputation 
<A NAME="161"></A>according to his deserts; and he always acted conformably to the institutions 
<A NAME="162"></A>of his country, without showing any affectation of doing so. Further, he 
<A NAME="163"></A>was not fond of change nor unsteady, but he loved to stay in the same places, 
<A NAME="164"></A>and to employ himself about the same things; and after his paroxysms of 
<A NAME="165"></A>headache he came immediately fresh and vigorous to his usual occupations. 
<A NAME="166"></A>His secrets were not but very few and very rare, and these only about public 
<A NAME="167"></A>matters; and he showed prudence and economy in the exhibition of the public 
<A NAME="168"></A>spectacles and the construction of public buildings, his donations to the 
<A NAME="169"></A>people, and in such things, for he was a man who looked to what ought to 
<A NAME="170"></A>be done, not to the reputation which is got by a man's acts. He did not 
<A NAME="171"></A>take the bath at unseasonable hours; he was not fond of building houses, 
<A NAME="172"></A>nor curious about what he ate, nor about the texture and colour of his 
<A NAME="173"></A>clothes, nor about the beauty of his slaves. His dress came from Lorium, 
<A NAME="174"></A>his villa on the coast, and from Lanuvium generally. We know how he behaved 
<A NAME="175"></A>to the toll-collector at Tusculum who asked his pardon; and such was all 
<A NAME="176"></A>his behaviour. There was in him nothing harsh, nor implacable, nor violent, 
<A NAME="177"></A>nor, as one may say, anything carried to the sweating point; but he examined 
<A NAME="178"></A>all things severally, as if he had abundance of time, and without confusion, 
<A NAME="179"></A>in an orderly way, vigorously and consistently. And that might be applied 
<A NAME="180"></A>to him which is recorded of Socrates, that he was able both to abstain 
<A NAME="181"></A>from, and to enjoy, those things which many are too weak to abstain from, 
<A NAME="182"></A>and cannot enjoy without excess. But to be strong enough both to bear the 
<A NAME="183"></A>one and to be sober in the other is the mark of a man who has a perfect 
<A NAME="184"></A>and invincible soul, such as he showed in the illness of 
<A NAME="185"></A>Maximus.
<A NAME="186"></A><BR><BR>To the gods I am indebted for having good grandfathers, good parents, 
<A NAME="187"></A>a good sister, good teachers, good associates, good kinsmen and friends, 
<A NAME="188"></A>nearly everything good. Further, I owe it to the gods that I was not hurried 
<A NAME="189"></A>into any offence against any of them, though I had a disposition which, 
<A NAME="190"></A>if opportunity had offered, might have led me to do something of this kind; 
<A NAME="191"></A>but, through their favour, there never was such a concurrence of circumstances 
<A NAME="192"></A>as put me to the trial. Further, I am thankful to the gods that I was not 
<A NAME="193"></A>longer brought up with my grandfather's concubine, and that I preserved 
<A NAME="194"></A>the flower of my youth, and that I did not make proof of my virility before 
<A NAME="195"></A>the proper season, but even deferred the time; that I was subjected to 
<A NAME="196"></A>a ruler and a father who was able to take away all pride from me, and to 
<A NAME="197"></A>bring me to the knowledge that it is possible for a man to live in a palace 
<A NAME="198"></A>without wanting either guards or embroidered dresses, or torches and statues, 
<A NAME="199"></A>and such-like show; but that it is in such a man's power to bring himself 
<A NAME="200"></A>very near to the fashion of a private person, without being for this reason 
<A NAME="201"></A>either meaner in thought, or more remiss in action, with respect to the 
<A NAME="202"></A>things which must be done for the public interest in a manner that befits 
<A NAME="203"></A>a ruler. I thank the gods for giving me such a brother, who was able by 
<A NAME="204"></A>his moral character to rouse me to vigilance over myself, and who, at the 
<A NAME="205"></A>same time, pleased me by his respect and affection; that my children have 
<A NAME="206"></A>not been stupid nor deformed in body; that I did not make more proficiency 
<A NAME="207"></A>in rhetoric, poetry, and the other studies, in which I should perhaps have 
<A NAME="208"></A>been completely engaged, if I had seen that I was making progress in them; 
<A NAME="209"></A>that I made haste to place those who brought me up in the station of honour, 
<A NAME="210"></A>which they seemed to desire, without putting them off with hope of my doing 
<A NAME="211"></A>it some time after, because they were then still young; that I knew Apollonius, 
<A NAME="212"></A>Rusticus, Maximus; that I received clear and frequent impressions about 
<A NAME="213"></A>living according to nature, and what kind of a life that is, so that, so 
<A NAME="214"></A>far as depended on the gods, and their gifts, and help, and inspirations, 
<A NAME="215"></A>nothing hindered me from forthwith living according to nature, though I 
<A NAME="216"></A>still fall short of it through my own fault, and through not observing 
<A NAME="217"></A>the admonitions of the gods, and, I may almost say, their direct instructions; 
<A NAME="218"></A>that my body has held out so long in such a kind of life; that I never 
<A NAME="219"></A>touched either Benedicta or Theodotus, and that, after having fallen into 
<A NAME="220"></A>amatory passions, I was cured; and, though I was often out of humour with 
<A NAME="221"></A>Rusticus, I never did anything of which I had occasion to repent; that, 
<A NAME="222"></A>though it was my mother's fate to die young, she spent the last years of 
<A NAME="223"></A>her life with me; that, whenever I wished to help any man in his need, 
<A NAME="224"></A>or on any other occasion, I was never told that I had not the means of 
<A NAME="225"></A>doing it; and that to myself the same necessity never happened, to receive 
<A NAME="226"></A>anything from another; that I have such a wife, so obedient, and so affectionate, 
<A NAME="227"></A>and so simple; that I had abundance of good masters for my children; and 
<A NAME="228"></A>that remedies have been shown to me by dreams, both others, and against 
<A NAME="229"></A>bloodspitting and giddiness...; and that, when I had an inclination to 
<A NAME="230"></A>philosophy, I did not fall into the hands of any sophist, and that I did 
<A NAME="231"></A>not waste my time on writers of histories, or in the resolution of syllogisms, 
<A NAME="232"></A>or occupy myself about the investigation of appearances in the heavens; 
<A NAME="233"></A>for all these things require the help of the gods and 
<A NAME="234"></A>fortune.
<A NAME="235"></A><BR><BR>Among the Quadi at the Granua.
