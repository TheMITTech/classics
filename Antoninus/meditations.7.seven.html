<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>What is badness? It is that which thou hast often seen. And on the occasion 
<A NAME="11"></A>of everything which happens keep this in mind, that it is that which thou 
<A NAME="12"></A>hast often seen. Everywhere up and down thou wilt find the same things, 
<A NAME="13"></A>with which the old histories are filled, those of the middle ages and those 
<A NAME="14"></A>of our own day; with which cities and houses are filled now. There is nothing 
<A NAME="15"></A>new: all things are both familiar and short-lived.
<A NAME="16"></A><BR><BR>How can our principles become dead, unless the impressions (thoughts) 
<A NAME="17"></A>which correspond to them are extinguished? But it is in thy power continuously 
<A NAME="18"></A>to fan these thoughts into a flame. I can have that opinion about anything, 
<A NAME="19"></A>which I ought to have. If I can, why am I disturbed? The things which are 
<A NAME="20"></A>external to my mind have no relation at all to my mind.- Let this be the 
<A NAME="21"></A>state of thy affects, and thou standest erect. To recover thy life is in 
<A NAME="22"></A>thy power. Look at things again as thou didst use to look at them; for 
<A NAME="23"></A>in this consists the recovery of thy life.
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR>The idle business of show, plays on the stage, flocks of sheep, 
<A NAME="25"></A>herds, exercises with spears, a bone cast to little dogs, a bit of bread 
<A NAME="26"></A>into fish-ponds, labourings of ants and burden-carrying, runnings about 
<A NAME="27"></A>of frightened little mice, puppets pulled by strings- all alike. It is 
<A NAME="28"></A>thy duty then in the midst of such things to show good humour and not a 
<A NAME="29"></A>proud air; to understand however that every man is worth just so much as 
<A NAME="30"></A>the things are worth about which he busies himself.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR>In discourse thou must attend to what is said, and in every movement 
<A NAME="32"></A>thou must observe what is doing. And in the one thou shouldst see immediately 
<A NAME="33"></A>to what end it refers, but in the other watch carefully what is the thing 
<A NAME="34"></A>signified.
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR>Is my understanding sufficient for this or not? If it is sufficient, 
<A NAME="36"></A>I use it for the work as an instrument given by the universal nature. But 
<A NAME="37"></A>if it is not sufficient, then either I retire from the work and give way 
<A NAME="38"></A>to him who is able to do it better, unless there be some reason why I ought 
<A NAME="39"></A>not to do so; or I do it as well as I can, taking to help me the man who 
<A NAME="40"></A>with the aid of my ruling principle can do what is now fit and useful for 
<A NAME="41"></A>the general good. For whatsoever either by myself or with another I can 
<A NAME="42"></A>do, ought to be directed to this only, to that which is useful and well 
<A NAME="43"></A>suited to society.
<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR>How many after being celebrated by fame have been given up to oblivion; 
<A NAME="45"></A>and how many who have celebrated the fame of others have long been 
<A NAME="46"></A>dead.
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR>Be not ashamed to be helped; for it is thy business to do thy duty 
<A NAME="48"></A>like a soldier in the assault on a town. How then, if being lame thou canst 
<A NAME="49"></A>not mount up on the battlements alone, but with the help of another it 
<A NAME="50"></A>is possible?
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR>Let not future things disturb thee, for thou wilt come to them, 
<A NAME="52"></A>if it shall be necessary, having with thee the same reason which now thou 
<A NAME="53"></A>usest for present things.
<A NAME="54"></A><BR><BR>All things are implicated with one another, and the bond is holy; 
<A NAME="55"></A>and there is hardly anything unconnected with any other thing. For things 
<A NAME="56"></A>have been co-ordinated, and they combine to form the same universe (order). 
<A NAME="57"></A>For there is one universe made up of all things, and one God who pervades 
<A NAME="58"></A>all things, and one substance, and one law, one common reason in all intelligent 
<A NAME="59"></A>animals, and one truth; if indeed there is also one perfection for all 
<A NAME="60"></A>animals which are of the same stock and participate in the same 
<A NAME="61"></A>reason.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR>Everything material soon disappears in the substance of the whole; 
<A NAME="63"></A>and everything formal (causal) is very soon taken back into the universal 
<A NAME="64"></A>reason; and the memory of everything is very soon overwhelmed in 
<A NAME="65"></A>time.
<A NAME="66"></A><BR><BR>To the rational animal the same act is according to nature and 
<A NAME="67"></A>according to reason.
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR>Be thou erect, or be made erect.
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>Just as it is with the members in those bodies which are united in 
<A NAME="70"></A>one, so it is with rational beings which exist separate, for they have 
<A NAME="71"></A>been constituted for one co-operation. And the perception of this will 
<A NAME="72"></A>be more apparent to thee, if thou often sayest to thyself that I am a member 
<A NAME="73"></A>(melos) of the system of rational beings. But if (using the letter r) thou 
<A NAME="74"></A>sayest that thou art a part (meros) thou dost not yet love men from thy 
<A NAME="75"></A>heart; beneficence does not yet delight thee for its own sake; thou still 
<A NAME="76"></A>doest it barely as a thing of propriety, and not yet as doing good to 
<A NAME="77"></A>thyself.
<A NAME="78"></A><BR><BR>Let there fall externally what will on the parts which can feel 
<A NAME="79"></A>the effects of this fall. For those parts which have felt will complain, 
<A NAME="80"></A>if they choose. But I, unless I think that what has happened is an evil, 
<A NAME="81"></A>am not injured. And it is in my power not to think so.
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR>Whatever any one does or says, I must be good, just as if the gold, 
<A NAME="83"></A>or the emerald, or the purple were always saying this, Whatever any one 
<A NAME="84"></A>does or says, I must be emerald and keep my colour.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>The ruling faculty does not disturb itself; I mean, does not frighten 
<A NAME="86"></A>itself or cause itself pain. But if any one else can frighten or pain it, 
<A NAME="87"></A>let him do so. For the faculty itself will not by its own opinion turn 
<A NAME="88"></A>itself into such ways. Let the body itself take care, if it can, that is 
<A NAME="89"></A>suffer nothing, and let it speak, if it suffers. But the soul itself, that 
<A NAME="90"></A>which is subject to fear, to pain, which has completely the power of forming 
<A NAME="91"></A>an opinion about these things, will suffer nothing, for it will never deviate 
<A NAME="92"></A>into such a judgement. The leading principle in itself wants nothing, unless 
<A NAME="93"></A>it makes a want for itself; and therefore it is both free from perturbation 
<A NAME="94"></A>and unimpeded, if it does not disturb and impede itself.
<A NAME="95"></A><BR><BR>Eudaemonia (happiness) is a good daemon, or a good thing. What 
<A NAME="96"></A>then art thou doing here, O imagination? Go away, I entreat thee by the 
<A NAME="97"></A>gods, as thou didst come, for I want thee not. But thou art come according 
<A NAME="98"></A>to thy old fashion. I am not angry with thee: only go 
<A NAME="99"></A>away.
<A NAME="100"></A><BR><BR>Is any man afraid of change? Why what can take place without change? 
<A NAME="101"></A>What then is more pleasing or more suitable to the universal nature? And 
<A NAME="102"></A>canst thou take a bath unless the wood undergoes a change? And canst thou 
<A NAME="103"></A>be nourished, unless the food undergoes a change? And can anything else 
<A NAME="104"></A>that is useful be accomplished without change? Dost thou not see then that 
<A NAME="105"></A>for thyself also to change is just the same, and equally necessary for 
<A NAME="106"></A>the universal nature?
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR>Through the universal substance as through a furious torrent all 
<A NAME="108"></A>bodies are carried, being by their nature united with and cooperating with 
<A NAME="109"></A>the whole, as the parts of our body with one another. How many a Chrysippus, 
<A NAME="110"></A>how many a Socrates, how many an Epictetus has time already swallowed up? 
<A NAME="111"></A>And let the same thought occur to thee with reference to every man and 
<A NAME="112"></A>thing.
<A NAME="113"></A><BR><BR>One thing only troubles me, lest I should do something which the 
<A NAME="114"></A>constitution of man does not allow, or in the way which it does not allow, 
<A NAME="115"></A>or what it does not allow now.
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR>Near is thy forgetfulness of all things; and near the forgetfulness 
<A NAME="117"></A>of thee by all.
<A NAME="118"></A><BR><BR>It is peculiar to man to love even those who do wrong. And this 
<A NAME="119"></A>happens, if when they do wrong it occurs to thee that they are kinsmen, 
<A NAME="120"></A>and that they do wrong through ignorance and unintentionally, and that 
<A NAME="121"></A>soon both of you will die; and above all, that the wrong-doer has done 
<A NAME="122"></A>thee no harm, for he has not made thy ruling faculty worse than it was 
<A NAME="123"></A>before.
<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR>The universal nature out of the universal substance, as if it were 
<A NAME="125"></A>wax, now moulds a horse, and when it has broken this up, it uses the material 
<A NAME="126"></A>for a tree, then for a man, then for something else; and each of these 
<A NAME="127"></A>things subsists for a very short time. But it is no hardship for the vessel 
<A NAME="128"></A>to be broken up, just as there was none in its being fastened 
<A NAME="129"></A>together.
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR>A scowling look is altogether unnatural; when it is often assumed, 
<A NAME="131"></A>the result is that all comeliness dies away, and at last is so completely 
<A NAME="132"></A>extinguished that it cannot be again lighted up at all. Try to conclude 
<A NAME="133"></A>from this very fact that it is contrary to reason. For if even the perception 
<A NAME="134"></A>of doing wrong shall depart, what reason is there for living any 
<A NAME="135"></A>longer?
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>Nature which governs the whole will soon change all things which 
<A NAME="137"></A>thou seest, and out of their substance will make other things, and again 
<A NAME="138"></A>other things from the substance of them, in order that the world may be 
<A NAME="139"></A>ever new.
<A NAME="140"></A><BR><BR>When a man has done thee any wrong, immediately consider with what 
<A NAME="141"></A>opinion about good or evil he has done wrong. For when thou hast seen this, 
<A NAME="142"></A>thou wilt pity him, and wilt neither wonder nor be angry. For either thou 
<A NAME="143"></A>thyself thinkest the same thing to be good that he does or another thing 
<A NAME="144"></A>of the same kind. It is thy duty then to pardon him. But if thou dost not 
<A NAME="145"></A>think such things to be good or evil, thou wilt more readily be well disposed 
<A NAME="146"></A>to him who is in error.
<A NAME="147"></A><BR><BR>Think not so much of what thou hast not as of what thou hast: but 
<A NAME="148"></A>of the things which thou hast select the best, and then reflect how eagerly 
<A NAME="149"></A>they would have been sought, if thou hadst them not. At the same time however 
<A NAME="150"></A>take care that thou dost not through being so pleased with them accustom 
<A NAME="151"></A>thyself to overvalue them, so as to be disturbed if ever thou shouldst 
<A NAME="152"></A>not have them.
<A NAME="153"></A><BR><BR>Retire into thyself. The rational principle which rules has this 
<A NAME="154"></A>nature, that it is content with itself when it does what is just, and so 
<A NAME="155"></A>secures tranquility.
<A NAME="156"></A><BR><BR>Wipe out the imagination. Stop the pulling of the strings. Confine 
<A NAME="157"></A>thyself to the present. Understand well what happens either to thee or 
<A NAME="158"></A>to another. Divide and distribute every object into the causal (formal) 
<A NAME="159"></A>and the material. Think of thy last hour. Let the wrong which is done by 
<A NAME="160"></A>a man stay there where the wrong was done.
<A NAME="161"></A><BR><BR>Direct thy attention to what is said. Let thy understanding enter 
<A NAME="162"></A>into the things that are doing and the things which do 
<A NAME="163"></A>them.
<A NAME="164"></A><BR><BR>Adorn thyself with simplicity and modesty and with indifference 
<A NAME="165"></A>towards the things which lie between virtue and vice. Love mankind. Follow 
<A NAME="166"></A>God. The poet says that Law rules all.- And it is enough to remember that 
<A NAME="167"></A>Law rules all.
<A NAME="168"></A><BR><BR>About death: Whether it is a dispersion, or a resolution into atoms, 
<A NAME="169"></A>or annihilation, it is either extinction or change.
<A NAME="170"></A><BR><BR>About pain: The pain which is intolerable carries us off; but that 
<A NAME="171"></A>which lasts a long time is tolerable; and the mind maintains its own tranquility 
<A NAME="172"></A>by retiring into itself, and the ruling faculty is not made worse. But 
<A NAME="173"></A>the parts which are harmed by pain, let them, if they can, give their opinion 
<A NAME="174"></A>about it.
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR>About fame: Look at the minds of those who seek fame, observe what 
<A NAME="176"></A>they are, and what kind of things they avoid, and what kind of things they 
<A NAME="177"></A>pursue. And consider that as the heaps of sand piled on one another hide 
<A NAME="178"></A>the former sands, so in life the events which go before are soon covered 
<A NAME="179"></A>by those which come after.
<A NAME="180"></A><BR><BR>From Plato: The man who has an elevated mind and takes a view of 
<A NAME="181"></A>all time and of all substance, dost thou suppose it possible for him to 
<A NAME="182"></A>think that human life is anything great? it is not possible, he said.- 
<A NAME="183"></A>Such a man then will think that death also is no evil.- Certainly 
<A NAME="184"></A>not.
<A NAME="185"></A><BR><BR>From Antisthenes: It is royal to do good and to be 
<A NAME="186"></A>abused.
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>It is a base thing for the countenance to be obedient and to regulate 
<A NAME="188"></A>and compose itself as the mind commands, and for the mind not to be regulated 
<A NAME="189"></A>and composed by itself.
<A NAME="190"></A><BR><BR>It is not right to vex ourselves at things,
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>For they care nought about it.
<A NAME="192"></A><BR><BR>To the immortal gods and us give joy.
<A NAME="193"></A><BR><BR>Life must be reaped like the ripe ears of corn:
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>One man is born; another dies.
<A NAME="195"></A><BR><BR>If gods care not for me and for my children,
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>There is a reason for it.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>For the good is with me, and the just.
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR>No joining others in their wailing, no violent 
<A NAME="199"></A>emotion.
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR>From Plato: But I would make this man a sufficient answer, which 
<A NAME="201"></A>is this: Thou sayest not well, if thou thinkest that a man who is good 
<A NAME="202"></A>for anything at all ought to compute the hazard of life or death, and should 
<A NAME="203"></A>not rather look to this only in all that he does, whether he is doing what 
<A NAME="204"></A>is just or unjust, and the works of a good or a bad 
<A NAME="205"></A>man.
<A NAME="206"></A><BR><BR>For thus it is, men of Athens, in truth: wherever a man has placed 
<A NAME="207"></A>himself thinking it the best place for him, or has been placed by a commander, 
<A NAME="208"></A>there in my opinion he ought to stay and to abide the hazard, taking nothing 
<A NAME="209"></A>into the reckoning, either death or anything else, before the baseness 
<A NAME="210"></A>of deserting his post.
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR>But, my good friend, reflect whether that which is noble and good 
<A NAME="212"></A>is not something different from saving and being saved; for as to a man 
<A NAME="213"></A>living such or such a time, at least one who is really a man, consider 
<A NAME="214"></A>if this is not a thing to be dismissed from the thoughts: and there must 
<A NAME="215"></A>be no love of life: but as to these matters a man must intrust them to 
<A NAME="216"></A>the deity and believe what the women say, that no man can escape his destiny, 
<A NAME="217"></A>the next inquiry being how he may best live the time that he has to 
<A NAME="218"></A>live.
<A NAME="219"></A><BR><BR>Look round at the courses of the stars, as if thou wert going along 
<A NAME="220"></A>with them; and constantly consider the changes of the elements into one 
<A NAME="221"></A>another; for such thoughts purge away the filth of the terrene 
<A NAME="222"></A>life.
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR>This is a fine saying of Plato: That he who is discoursing about 
<A NAME="224"></A>men should look also at earthly things as if he viewed them from some higher 
<A NAME="225"></A>place; should look at them in their assemblies, armies, agricultural labours, 
<A NAME="226"></A>marriages, treaties, births, deaths, noise of the courts of justice, desert 
<A NAME="227"></A>places, various nations of barbarians, feasts, lamentations, markets, a 
<A NAME="228"></A>mixture of all things and an orderly combination of 
<A NAME="229"></A>contraries.
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR>Consider the past; such great changes of political supremacies. 
<A NAME="231"></A>Thou mayest foresee also the things which will be. For they will certainly 
<A NAME="232"></A>be of like form, and it is not possible that they should deviate from the 
<A NAME="233"></A>order of the things which take place now: accordingly to have contemplated 
<A NAME="234"></A>human life for forty years is the same as to have contemplated it for ten 
<A NAME="235"></A>thousand years. For what more wilt thou see?
<A NAME="236"></A><BR><BR>That which has grown from the earth to the earth,
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>But that which has sprung from heavenly seed,
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>Back to the heavenly realms returns. This is either a dissolution of 
<A NAME="239"></A>the mutual involution of the atoms, or a similar dispersion of the unsentient 
<A NAME="240"></A>elements.
<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR>With food and drinks and cunning magic arts
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>Turning the channel's course to 'scape from death.
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>The breeze which heaven has sent
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>We must endure, and toil without complaining.
<A NAME="245"></A><BR><BR>Another may be more expert in casting his opponent; but he is not 
<A NAME="246"></A>more social, nor more modest, nor better disciplined to meet all that happens, 
<A NAME="247"></A>nor more considerate with respect to the faults of his 
<A NAME="248"></A>neighbours.
<A NAME="249"></A><BR><BR>Where any work can be done conformably to the reason which is common 
<A NAME="250"></A>to gods and men, there we have nothing to fear: for where we are able to 
<A NAME="251"></A>get profit by means of the activity which is successful and proceeds according 
<A NAME="252"></A>to our constitution, there no harm is to be suspected.
<A NAME="253"></A><BR><BR>Everywhere and at all times it is in thy power piously to acquiesce 
<A NAME="254"></A>in thy present condition, and to behave justly to those who are about thee, 
<A NAME="255"></A>and to exert thy skill upon thy present thoughts, that nothing shall steal 
<A NAME="256"></A>into them without being well examined.
<A NAME="257"></A><BR><BR>Do not look around thee to discover other men's ruling principles, 
<A NAME="258"></A>but look straight to this, to what nature leads thee, both the universal 
<A NAME="259"></A>nature through the things which happen to thee, and thy own nature through 
<A NAME="260"></A>the acts which must be done by thee. But every being ought to do that which 
<A NAME="261"></A>is according to its constitution; and all other things have been constituted 
<A NAME="262"></A>for the sake of rational beings, just as among irrational things the inferior 
<A NAME="263"></A>for the sake of the superior, but the rational for the sake of one 
<A NAME="264"></A>another.
<A NAME="265"></A><BR><BR>The prime principle then in man's constitution is the social. And 
<A NAME="266"></A>the second is not to yield to the persuasions of the body, for it is the 
<A NAME="267"></A>peculiar office of the rational and intelligent motion to circumscribe 
<A NAME="268"></A>itself, and never to be overpowered either by the motion of the senses 
<A NAME="269"></A>or of the appetites, for both are animal; but the intelligent motion claims 
<A NAME="270"></A>superiority and does not permit itself to be overpowered by the others. 
<A NAME="271"></A>And with good reason, for it is formed by nature to use all of them. The 
<A NAME="272"></A>third thing in the rational constitution is freedom from error and from 
<A NAME="273"></A>deception. Let then the ruling principle holding fast to these things go 
<A NAME="274"></A>straight on, and it has what is its own.
<A NAME="275"></A><BR><BR>Consider thyself to be dead, and to have completed thy life up 
<A NAME="276"></A>to the present time; and live according to nature the remainder which is 
<A NAME="277"></A>allowed thee.
<A NAME="278"></A><BR><BR>Love that only which happens to thee and is spun with the thread 
<A NAME="279"></A>of thy destiny. For what is more suitable?
<A NAME="280"></A><BR><BR>In everything which happens keep before thy eyes those to whom 
<A NAME="281"></A>the same things happened, and how they were vexed, and treated them as 
<A NAME="282"></A>strange things, and found fault with them: and now where are they? Nowhere. 
<A NAME="283"></A>Why then dost thou too choose to act in the same way? And why dost thou 
<A NAME="284"></A>not leave these agitations which are foreign to nature, to those who cause 
<A NAME="285"></A>them and those who are moved by them? And why art thou not altogether intent 
<A NAME="286"></A>upon the right way of making use of the things which happen to thee? For 
<A NAME="287"></A>then thou wilt use them well, and they will be a material for thee to work 
<A NAME="288"></A>on. Only attend to thyself, and resolve to be a good man in every act which 
<A NAME="289"></A>thou doest: and remember...
<A NAME="290"></A><BR><BR>Look within. Within is the fountain of good, and it will ever bubble 
<A NAME="291"></A>up, if thou wilt ever dig.
<A NAME="292"></A><BR><BR>The body ought to be compact, and to show no irregularity either 
<A NAME="293"></A>in motion or attitude. For what the mind shows in the face by maintaining 
<A NAME="294"></A>in it the expression of intelligence and propriety, that ought to be required 
<A NAME="295"></A>also in the whole body. But all of these things should be observed without 
<A NAME="296"></A>affectation.
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR>The art of life is more like the wrestler's art than the dancer's, 
<A NAME="298"></A>in respect of this, that it should stand ready and firm to meet onsets 
<A NAME="299"></A>which are sudden and unexpected.
<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR>Constantly observe who those are whose approbation thou wishest 
<A NAME="301"></A>to have, and what ruling principles they possess. For then thou wilt neither 
<A NAME="302"></A>blame those who offend involuntarily, nor wilt thou want their approbation, 
<A NAME="303"></A>if thou lookest to the sources of their opinions and 
<A NAME="304"></A>appetites.
<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR>Every soul, the philosopher says, is involuntarily deprived of 
<A NAME="306"></A>truth; consequently in the same way it is deprived of justice and temperance 
<A NAME="307"></A>and benevolence and everything of the kind. It is most necessary to bear 
<A NAME="308"></A>this constantly in mind, for thus thou wilt be more gentle towards 
<A NAME="309"></A>all.
<A NAME="310"></A><BR><BR>In every pain let this thought be present, that there is no dishonour 
<A NAME="311"></A>in it, nor does it make the governing intelligence worse, for it does not 
<A NAME="312"></A>damage the intelligence either so far as the intelligence is rational or 
<A NAME="313"></A>so far as it is social. Indeed in the case of most pains let this remark 
<A NAME="314"></A>of Epicurus aid thee, that pain is neither intolerable nor everlasting, 
<A NAME="315"></A>if thou bearest in mind that it has its limits, and if thou addest nothing 
<A NAME="316"></A>to it in imagination: and remember this too, that we do not perceive that 
<A NAME="317"></A>many things which are disagreeable to us are the same as pain, such as 
<A NAME="318"></A>excessive drowsiness, and the being scorched by heat, and the having no 
<A NAME="319"></A>appetite. When then thou art discontented about any of these things, say 
<A NAME="320"></A>to thyself, that thou art yielding to pain.
<A NAME="321"></A><BR><BR>Take care not to feel towards the inhuman, as they feel towards 
<A NAME="322"></A>men.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>How do we know if Telauges was not superior in character to Socrates? 
<A NAME="324"></A>For it is not enough that Socrates died a more noble death, and disputed 
<A NAME="325"></A>more skilfully with the sophists, and passed the night in the cold with 
<A NAME="326"></A>more endurance, and that when he was bid to arrest Leon of Salamis, he 
<A NAME="327"></A>considered it more noble to refuse, and that he walked in a swaggering 
<A NAME="328"></A>way in the streets- though as to this fact one may have great doubts if 
<A NAME="329"></A>it was true. But we ought to inquire, what kind of a soul it was that Socrates 
<A NAME="330"></A>possessed, and if he was able to be content with being just towards men 
<A NAME="331"></A>and pious towards the gods, neither idly vexed on account of men's villainy, 
<A NAME="332"></A>nor yet making himself a slave to any man's ignorance, nor receiving as 
<A NAME="333"></A>strange anything that fell to his share out of the universal, nor enduring 
<A NAME="334"></A>it as intolerable, nor allowing his understanding to sympathize with the 
<A NAME="335"></A>affects of the miserable flesh.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR><BR>Nature has not so mingled the intelligence with the composition 
<A NAME="337"></A>of the body, as not to have allowed thee the power of circumscribing thyself 
<A NAME="338"></A>and of bringing under subjection to thyself all that is thy own; for it 
<A NAME="339"></A>is very possible to be a divine man and to be recognised as such by no 
<A NAME="340"></A>one. Always bear this in mind; and another thing too, that very little 
<A NAME="341"></A>indeed is necessary for living a happy life. And because thou hast despaired 
<A NAME="342"></A>of becoming a dialectician and skilled in the knowledge of nature, do not 
<A NAME="343"></A>for this reason renounce the hope of being both free and modest and social 
<A NAME="344"></A>and obedient to God.
<A NAME="345"></A><BR><BR>It is in thy power to live free from all compulsion in the greatest 
<A NAME="346"></A>tranquility of mind, even if all the world cry out against thee as much 
<A NAME="347"></A>as they choose, and even if wild beasts tear in pieces the members of this 
<A NAME="348"></A>kneaded matter which has grown around thee. For what hinders the mind in 
<A NAME="349"></A>the midst of all this from maintaining itself in tranquility and in a just 
<A NAME="350"></A>judgement of all surrounding things and in a ready use of the objects which 
<A NAME="351"></A>are presented to it, so that the judgement may say to the thing which falls 
<A NAME="352"></A>under its observation: This thou art in substance (reality), though in 
<A NAME="353"></A>men's opinion thou mayest appear to be of a different kind; and the use 
<A NAME="354"></A>shall say to that which falls under the hand: Thou art the thing that I 
<A NAME="355"></A>was seeking; for to me that which presents itself is always a material 
<A NAME="356"></A>for virtue both rational and political, and in a word, for the exercise 
<A NAME="357"></A>of art, which belongs to man or God. For everything which happens has a 
<A NAME="358"></A>relationship either to God or man, and is neither new nor difficult to 
<A NAME="359"></A>handle, but usual and apt matter to work on.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR>The perfection of moral character consists in this, in passing 
<A NAME="361"></A>every day as the last, and in being neither violently excited nor torpid 
<A NAME="362"></A>nor playing the hypocrite.
<A NAME="363"></A><BR><BR>The gods who are immortal are not vexed because during so long 
<A NAME="364"></A>a time they must tolerate continually men such as they are and so many 
<A NAME="365"></A>of them bad; and besides this, they also take care of them in all ways. 
<A NAME="366"></A>But thou, who art destined to end so soon, art thou wearied of enduring 
<A NAME="367"></A>the bad, and this too when thou art one of them?
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR>It is a ridiculous thing for a man not to fly from his own badness, 
<A NAME="369"></A>which is indeed possible, but to fly from other men's badness, which is 
<A NAME="370"></A>impossible.
<A NAME="371"></A><BR><BR>Whatever the rational and political (social) faculty finds to be 
<A NAME="372"></A>neither intelligent nor social, it properly judges to be inferior to 
<A NAME="373"></A>itself.
<A NAME="374"></A><BR><BR>When thou hast done a good act and another has received it, why 
<A NAME="375"></A>dost thou look for a third thing besides these, as fools do, either to 
<A NAME="376"></A>have the reputation of having done a good act or to obtain a 
<A NAME="377"></A>return?
<A NAME="378"></A><BR><BR>No man is tired of receiving what is useful. But it is useful to 
<A NAME="379"></A>act according to nature. Do not then be tired of receiving what is useful 
<A NAME="380"></A>by doing it to others.
<A NAME="381"></A><BR><BR>The nature of the An moved to make the universe. But now either 
<A NAME="382"></A>everything that takes place comes by way of consequence or continuity; 
<A NAME="383"></A>or even the chief things towards which the ruling power of the universe 
<A NAME="384"></A>directs its own movement are governed by no rational principle. If this 
<A NAME="385"></A>is remembered it will make thee more tranquil in many 
<A NAME="386"></A>things.
