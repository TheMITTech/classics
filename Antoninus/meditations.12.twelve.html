<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>All those things at which thou wishest to arrive by a circuitous road, 
<A NAME="11"></A>thou canst have now, if thou dost not refuse them to thyself. And this 
<A NAME="12"></A>means, if thou wilt take no notice of all the past, and trust the future 
<A NAME="13"></A>to providence, and direct the present only conformably to piety and justice. 
<A NAME="14"></A>Conformably to piety, that thou mayest be content with the lot which is 
<A NAME="15"></A>assigned to thee, for nature designed it for thee and thee for it. Conformably 
<A NAME="16"></A>to justice, that thou mayest always speak the truth freely and without 
<A NAME="17"></A>disguise, and do the things which are agreeable to law and according to 
<A NAME="18"></A>the worth of each. And let neither another man's wickedness hinder thee, 
<A NAME="19"></A>nor opinion nor voice, nor yet the sensations of the poor flesh which has 
<A NAME="20"></A>grown about thee; for the passive part will look to this. If then, whatever 
<A NAME="21"></A>the time may be when thou shalt be near to thy departure, neglecting everything 
<A NAME="22"></A>else thou shalt respect only thy ruling faculty and the divinity within 
<A NAME="23"></A>thee, and if thou shalt be afraid not because thou must some time cease 
<A NAME="24"></A>to live, but if thou shalt fear never to have begun to live according to 
<A NAME="25"></A>nature- then thou wilt be a man worthy of the universe which has produced 
<A NAME="26"></A>thee, and thou wilt cease to be a stranger in thy native land, and to wonder 
<A NAME="27"></A>at things which happen daily as if they were something unexpected, and 
<A NAME="28"></A>to be dependent on this or that.
<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR>God sees the minds (ruling principles) of all men bared of the 
<A NAME="30"></A>material vesture and rind and impurities. For with his intellectual part 
<A NAME="31"></A>alone he touches the intelligence only which has flowed and been derived 
<A NAME="32"></A>from himself into these bodies. And if thou also usest thyself to do this, 
<A NAME="33"></A>thou wilt rid thyself of thy much trouble. For he who regards not the poor 
<A NAME="34"></A>flesh which envelops him, surely will not trouble himself by looking after 
<A NAME="35"></A>raiment and dwelling and fame and such like externals and 
<A NAME="36"></A>show.
<A NAME="37"></A><BR><BR>The things are three of which thou art composed, a little body, 
<A NAME="38"></A>a little breath (life), intelligence. Of these the first two are thine, 
<A NAME="39"></A>so far as it is thy duty to take care of them; but the third alone is properly 
<A NAME="40"></A>thine. Therefore if thou shalt separate from thyself, that is, from thy 
<A NAME="41"></A>understanding, whatever others do or say, and whatever thou hast done or 
<A NAME="42"></A>said thyself, and whatever future things trouble thee because they may 
<A NAME="43"></A>happen, and whatever in the body which envelops thee or in the breath (life), 
<A NAME="44"></A>which is by nature associated with the body, is attached to thee independent 
<A NAME="45"></A>of thy will, and whatever the external circumfluent vortex whirls round, 
<A NAME="46"></A>so that the intellectual power exempt from the things of fate can live 
<A NAME="47"></A>pure and free by itself, doing what is just and accepting what happens 
<A NAME="48"></A>and saying the truth: if thou wilt separate, I say, from this ruling faculty 
<A NAME="49"></A>the things which are attached to it by the impressions of sense, and the 
<A NAME="50"></A>things of time to come and of time that is past, and wilt make thyself 
<A NAME="51"></A>like Empedocles' sphere,
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR>All round, and in its joyous rest reposing; and if thou shalt strive 
<A NAME="53"></A>to live only what is really thy life, that is, the present- then thou wilt 
<A NAME="54"></A>be able to pass that portion of life which remains for thee up to the time 
<A NAME="55"></A>of thy death, free from perturbations, nobly, and obedient to thy own daemon 
<A NAME="56"></A>(to the god that is within thee).
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR>I have often wondered how it is that every man loves himself more 
<A NAME="58"></A>than all the rest of men, but yet sets less value on his own opinion of 
<A NAME="59"></A>himself than on the opinion of others. If then a god or a wise teacher 
<A NAME="60"></A>should present himself to a man and bid him to think of nothing and to 
<A NAME="61"></A>design nothing which he would not express as soon as he conceived it, he 
<A NAME="62"></A>could not endure it even for a single day. So much more respect have we 
<A NAME="63"></A>to what our neighbours shall think of us than to what we shall think of 
<A NAME="64"></A>ourselves.
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR>How can it be that the gods after having arranged all things well 
<A NAME="66"></A>and benevolently for mankind, have overlooked this alone, that some men 
<A NAME="67"></A>and very good men, and men who, as we may say, have had most communion 
<A NAME="68"></A>with the divinity, and through pious acts and religious observances have 
<A NAME="69"></A>been most intimate with the divinity, when they have once died should never 
<A NAME="70"></A>exist again, but should be completely extinguished?
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>But if this is so, be assured that if it ought to have been otherwise, 
<A NAME="72"></A>the gods would have done it. For if it were just, it would also be possible; 
<A NAME="73"></A>and if it were according to nature, nature would have had it so. But because 
<A NAME="74"></A>it is not so, if in fact it is not so, be thou convinced that it ought 
<A NAME="75"></A>not to have been so:- for thou seest even of thyself that in this inquiry 
<A NAME="76"></A>thou art disputing with the diety; and we should not thus dispute with 
<A NAME="77"></A>the gods, unless they were most excellent and most just;- but if this is 
<A NAME="78"></A>so, they would not have allowed anything in the ordering of the universe 
<A NAME="79"></A>to be neglected unjustly and irrationally.
<A NAME="80"></A><BR><BR>Practise thyself even in the things which thou despairest of accomplishing. 
<A NAME="81"></A>For even the left hand, which is ineffectual for all other things for want 
<A NAME="82"></A>of practice, holds the bridle more vigorously than the right hand; for 
<A NAME="83"></A>it has been practised in this.
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><BR>Consider in what condition both in body and soul a man should be 
<A NAME="85"></A>when he is overtaken by death; and consider the shortness of life, the 
<A NAME="86"></A>boundless abyss of time past and future, the feebleness of all 
<A NAME="87"></A>matter.
<A NAME="88"></A><BR><BR>Contemplate the formative principles (forms) of things bare of 
<A NAME="89"></A>their coverings; the purposes of actions; consider what pain is, what pleasure 
<A NAME="90"></A>is, and death, and fame; who is to himself the cause of his uneasiness; 
<A NAME="91"></A>how no man is hindered by another; that everything is 
<A NAME="92"></A>opinion.
<A NAME="93"></A><BR><BR>In the application of thy principles thou must be like the pancratiast, 
<A NAME="94"></A>not like the gladiator; for the gladiator lets fall the sword which he 
<A NAME="95"></A>uses and is killed; but the other always has his hand, and needs to do 
<A NAME="96"></A>nothing else than use it.
<A NAME="97"></A><BR><BR>See what things are in themselves, dividing them into matter, form 
<A NAME="98"></A>and purpose.
<A NAME="99"></A><BR><BR>What a power man has to do nothing except what God will approve, 
<A NAME="100"></A>and to accept all that God may give him.
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR>With respect to that which happens conformably to nature, we ought 
<A NAME="102"></A>to blame neither gods, for they do nothing wrong either voluntarily or 
<A NAME="103"></A>involuntarily, nor men, for they do nothing wrong except involuntarily. 
<A NAME="104"></A>Consequently we should blame nobody.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR>How ridiculous and what a stranger he is who is surprised at anything 
<A NAME="106"></A>which happens in life.
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR>Either there is a fatal necessity and invincible order, or a kind 
<A NAME="108"></A>Providence, or a confusion without a purpose and without a director (Book 
<A NAME="109"></A>IV). If then there is an invincible necessity, why dost thou resist? But 
<A NAME="110"></A>if there is a Providence which allows itself to be propitiated, make thyself 
<A NAME="111"></A>worthy of the help of the divinity. But if there is a confusion without 
<A NAME="112"></A>governor, be content that in such a tempest thou hast in thyself a certain 
<A NAME="113"></A>ruling intelligence. And even if the tempest carry thee away, let it carry 
<A NAME="114"></A>away the poor flesh, the poor breath, everything else; for the intelligence 
<A NAME="115"></A>at least it will not carry away.
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR>Does the light of the lamp shine without losing its splendour until 
<A NAME="117"></A>it is extinguished; and shall the truth which is in thee and justice and 
<A NAME="118"></A>temperance be extinguished before thy death?
<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR>When a man has presented the appearance of having done wrong, say, 
<A NAME="120"></A>How then do I know if this is a wrongful act? And even if he has done wrong, 
<A NAME="121"></A>how do I know that he has not condemned himself? and so this is like tearing 
<A NAME="122"></A>his own face. Consider that he, who would not have the bad man do wrong, 
<A NAME="123"></A>is like the man who would not have the fig-tree to bear juice in the figs 
<A NAME="124"></A>and infants to cry and the horse to neigh, and whatever else must of necessity 
<A NAME="125"></A>be. For what must a man do who has such a character? If then thou art irritable, 
<A NAME="126"></A>cure this man's disposition.
<A NAME="127"></A><BR><BR>If it is not right, do not do it: if it is not true, do not say 
<A NAME="128"></A>it. For let thy efforts be-
<A NAME="129"></A><BR><BR>In everything always observe what the thing is which produces for 
<A NAME="130"></A>thee an appearance, and resolve it by dividing it into the formal, the 
<A NAME="131"></A>material, the purpose, and the time within which it must 
<A NAME="132"></A>end.
<A NAME="133"></A><BR><BR>Perceive at last that thou hast in thee something better and more 
<A NAME="134"></A>divine than the things which cause the various affects, and as it were 
<A NAME="135"></A>pull thee by the strings. What is there now in my mind? Is it fear, or 
<A NAME="136"></A>suspicion, or desire, or anything of the kind?
<A NAME="137"></A><BR><BR>First, do nothing inconsiderately, nor without a purpose. Second, 
<A NAME="138"></A>make thy acts refer to nothing else than to a social 
<A NAME="139"></A>end.
<A NAME="140"></A><BR><BR>Consider that before long thou wilt be nobody and nowhere, nor 
<A NAME="141"></A>will any of the things exist which thou now seest, nor any of those who 
<A NAME="142"></A>are now living. For all things are formed by nature to change and be turned 
<A NAME="143"></A>and to perish in order that other things in continuous succession may 
<A NAME="144"></A>exist.
<A NAME="145"></A><BR><BR>Consider that everything is opinion, and opinion is in thy power. 
<A NAME="146"></A>Take away then, when thou choosest, thy opinion, and like a mariner, who 
<A NAME="147"></A>has doubled the promontory, thou wilt find calm, everything stable, and 
<A NAME="148"></A>a waveless bay.
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR>Any one activity whatever it may be, when it has ceased at its 
<A NAME="150"></A>proper time, suffers no evil because it has ceased; nor he who has done 
<A NAME="151"></A>this act, does he suffer any evil for this reason that the act has ceased. 
<A NAME="152"></A>In like manner then the whole which consists of all the acts, which is 
<A NAME="153"></A>our life, if it cease at its proper time, suffers no evil for this reason 
<A NAME="154"></A>that it has ceased; nor he who has terminated this series at the proper 
<A NAME="155"></A>time, has he been ill dealt with. But the proper time and the limit nature 
<A NAME="156"></A>fixes, sometimes as in old age the peculiar nature of man, but always the 
<A NAME="157"></A>universal nature, by the change of whose parts the whole universe continues 
<A NAME="158"></A>ever young and perfect. And everything which is useful to the universal 
<A NAME="159"></A>is always good and in season. Therefore the termination of life for every 
<A NAME="160"></A>man is no evil, because neither is it shameful, since it is both independent 
<A NAME="161"></A>of the will and not opposed to the general interest, but it is good, since 
<A NAME="162"></A>it is seasonable and profitable to and congruent with the universal. For 
<A NAME="163"></A>thus too he is moved by the deity who is moved in the same manner with 
<A NAME="164"></A>the deity and moved towards the same things in his mind.
<A NAME="165"></A><BR><BR>These three principles thou must have in readiness. In the things 
<A NAME="166"></A>which thou doest do nothing either inconsiderately or otherwise than as 
<A NAME="167"></A>justice herself would act; but with respect to what may happen to thee 
<A NAME="168"></A>from without, consider that it happens either by chance or according to 
<A NAME="169"></A>Providence, and thou must neither blame chance nor accuse Providence. Second, 
<A NAME="170"></A>consider what every being is from the seed to the time of its receiving 
<A NAME="171"></A>a soul, and from the reception of a soul to the giving back of the same, 
<A NAME="172"></A>and of what things every being is compounded and into what things it is 
<A NAME="173"></A>resolved. Third, if thou shouldst suddenly be raised up above the earth, 
<A NAME="174"></A>and shouldst look down on human things, and observe the variety of them 
<A NAME="175"></A>how great it is, and at the same time also shouldst see at a glance how 
<A NAME="176"></A>great is the number of beings who dwell around in the air and the aether, 
<A NAME="177"></A>consider that as often as thou shouldst be raised up, thou wouldst see 
<A NAME="178"></A>the same things, sameness of form and shortness of duration. Are these 
<A NAME="179"></A>things to be proud of?
<A NAME="180"></A><BR><BR>Cast away opinion: thou art saved. Who then hinders thee from casting 
<A NAME="181"></A>it away?
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>When thou art troubled about anything, thou hast forgotten this, 
<A NAME="183"></A>that all things happen according to the universal nature; and forgotten 
<A NAME="184"></A>this, that a man's wrongful act is nothing to thee; and further thou hast 
<A NAME="185"></A>forgotten this, that everything which happens, always happened so and will 
<A NAME="186"></A>happen so, and now happens so everywhere; forgotten this too, how close 
<A NAME="187"></A>is the kinship between a man and the whole human race, for it is a community, 
<A NAME="188"></A>not of a little blood or seed, but of intelligence. And thou hast forgotten 
<A NAME="189"></A>this too, that every man's intelligence is a god, and is an efflux of the 
<A NAME="190"></A>deity; and forgotten this, that nothing is a man's own, but that his child 
<A NAME="191"></A>and his body and his very soul came from the deity; forgotten this, that 
<A NAME="192"></A>everything is opinion; and lastly thou hast forgotten that every man lives 
<A NAME="193"></A>the present time only, and loses only this.
<A NAME="194"></A><BR><BR>Constantly bring to thy recollection those who have complained 
<A NAME="195"></A>greatly about anything, those who have been most conspicuous by the greatest 
<A NAME="196"></A>fame or misfortunes or enmities or fortunes of any kind: then think where 
<A NAME="197"></A>are they all now? Smoke and ash and a tale, or not even a tale. And let 
<A NAME="198"></A>there be present to thy mind also everything of this sort, how Fabius Catullinus 
<A NAME="199"></A>lived in the country, and Lucius Lupus in his gardens, and Stertinius at 
<A NAME="200"></A>Baiae, and Tiberius at Capreae and Velius Rufus (or Rufus at Velia); and 
<A NAME="201"></A>in fine think of the eager pursuit of anything conjoined with pride; and 
<A NAME="202"></A>how worthless everything is after which men violently strain; and how much 
<A NAME="203"></A>more philosophical it is for a man in the opportunities presented to him 
<A NAME="204"></A>to show
