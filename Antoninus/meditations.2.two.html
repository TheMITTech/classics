<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Begin the morning by saying to thyself, I shall meet with the busy-body, 
<A NAME="11"></A>the ungrateful, arrogant, deceitful, envious, unsocial. All these things 
<A NAME="12"></A>happen to them by reason of their ignorance of what is good and evil. But 
<A NAME="13"></A>I who have seen the nature of the good that it is beautiful, and of the 
<A NAME="14"></A>bad that it is ugly, and the nature of him who does wrong, that it is akin 
<A NAME="15"></A>to me, not only of the same blood or seed, but that it participates in 
<A NAME="16"></A>the same intelligence and the same portion of the divinity, I can neither 
<A NAME="17"></A>be injured by any of them, for no one can fix on me what is ugly, nor can 
<A NAME="18"></A>I be angry with my kinsman, nor hate him, For we are made for co-operation, 
<A NAME="19"></A>like feet, like hands, like eyelids, like the rows of the upper and lower 
<A NAME="20"></A>teeth. To act against one another then is contrary to nature; and it is 
<A NAME="21"></A>acting against one another to be vexed and to turn away.
<A NAME="22"></A><BR><BR>Whatever this is that I am, it is a little flesh and breath, and 
<A NAME="23"></A>the ruling part. Throw away thy books; no longer distract thyself: it is 
<A NAME="24"></A>not allowed; but as if thou wast now dying, despise the flesh; it is blood 
<A NAME="25"></A>and bones and a network, a contexture of nerves, veins, and arteries. See 
<A NAME="26"></A>the breath also, what kind of a thing it is, air, and not always the same, 
<A NAME="27"></A>but every moment sent out and again sucked in. The third then is the ruling 
<A NAME="28"></A>part: consider thus: Thou art an old man; no longer let this be a slave, 
<A NAME="29"></A>no longer be pulled by the strings like a puppet to unsocial movements, 
<A NAME="30"></A>no longer either be dissatisfied with thy present lot, or shrink from the 
<A NAME="31"></A>future.
<A NAME="32"></A><BR><BR>All that is from the gods is full of Providence. That which is 
<A NAME="33"></A>from fortune is not separated from nature or without an interweaving and 
<A NAME="34"></A>involution with the things which are ordered by Providence. From thence 
<A NAME="35"></A>all things flow; and there is besides necessity, and that which is for 
<A NAME="36"></A>the advantage of the whole universe, of which thou art a part. But that 
<A NAME="37"></A>is good for every part of nature which the nature of the whole brings, 
<A NAME="38"></A>and what serves to maintain this nature. Now the universe is preserved, 
<A NAME="39"></A>as by the changes of the elements so by the changes of things compounded 
<A NAME="40"></A>of the elements. Let these principles be enough for thee, let them always 
<A NAME="41"></A>be fixed opinions. But cast away the thirst after books, that thou mayest 
<A NAME="42"></A>not die murmuring, but cheerfully, truly, and from thy heart thankful to 
<A NAME="43"></A>the gods.
<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR>Remember how long thou hast been putting off these things, and 
<A NAME="45"></A>how often thou hast received an opportunity from the gods, and yet dost 
<A NAME="46"></A>not use it. Thou must now at last perceive of what universe thou art a 
<A NAME="47"></A>part, and of what administrator of the universe thy existence is an efflux, 
<A NAME="48"></A>and that a limit of time is fixed for thee, which if thou dost not use 
<A NAME="49"></A>for clearing away the clouds from thy mind, it will go and thou wilt go, 
<A NAME="50"></A>and it will never return.
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR>Every moment think steadily as a Roman and a man to do what thou 
<A NAME="52"></A>hast in hand with perfect and simple dignity, and feeling of affection, 
<A NAME="53"></A>and freedom, and justice; and to give thyself relief from all other thoughts. 
<A NAME="54"></A>And thou wilt give thyself relief, if thou doest every act of thy life 
<A NAME="55"></A>as if it were the last, laying aside all carelessness and passionate aversion 
<A NAME="56"></A>from the commands of reason, and all hypocrisy, and self-love, and discontent 
<A NAME="57"></A>with the portion which has been given to thee. Thou seest how few the things 
<A NAME="58"></A>are, the which if a man lays hold of, he is able to live a life which flows 
<A NAME="59"></A>in quiet, and is like the existence of the gods; for the gods on their 
<A NAME="60"></A>part will require nothing more from him who observes these 
<A NAME="61"></A>things.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR>Do wrong to thyself, do wrong to thyself, my soul; but thou wilt 
<A NAME="63"></A>no longer have the opportunity of honouring thyself. Every man's life is 
<A NAME="64"></A>sufficient. But thine is nearly finished, though thy soul reverences not 
<A NAME="65"></A>itself but places thy felicity in the souls of others.
<A NAME="66"></A><BR><BR>Do the things external which fall upon thee distract thee? Give 
<A NAME="67"></A>thyself time to learn something new and good, and cease to be whirled around. 
<A NAME="68"></A>But then thou must also avoid being carried about the other way. For those 
<A NAME="69"></A>too are triflers who have wearied themselves in life by their activity, 
<A NAME="70"></A>and yet have no object to which to direct every movement, and, in a word, 
<A NAME="71"></A>all their thoughts.
<A NAME="72"></A><BR><BR>Through not observing what is in the mind of another a man has 
<A NAME="73"></A>seldom been seen to be unhappy; but those who do not observe the movements 
<A NAME="74"></A>of their own minds must of necessity be unhappy.
<A NAME="75"></A><BR><BR>This thou must always bear in mind, what is the nature of the whole, 
<A NAME="76"></A>and what is my nature, and how this is related to that, and what kind of 
<A NAME="77"></A>a part it is of what kind of a whole; and that there is no one who hinders 
<A NAME="78"></A>thee from always doing and saying the things which are according to the 
<A NAME="79"></A>nature of which thou art a part.
<A NAME="80"></A><BR><BR>Theophrastus, in his comparison of bad acts- such a comparison 
<A NAME="81"></A>as one would make in accordance with the common notions of mankind- says, 
<A NAME="82"></A>like a true philosopher, that the offences which are committed through 
<A NAME="83"></A>desire are more blameable than those which are committed through anger. 
<A NAME="84"></A>For he who is excited by anger seems to turn away from reason with a certain 
<A NAME="85"></A>pain and unconscious contraction; but he who offends through desire, being 
<A NAME="86"></A>overpowered by pleasure, seems to be in a manner more intemperate and more 
<A NAME="87"></A>womanish in his offences. Rightly then, and in a way worthy of philosophy, 
<A NAME="88"></A>he said that the offence which is committed with pleasure is more blameable 
<A NAME="89"></A>than that which is committed with pain; and on the whole the one is more 
<A NAME="90"></A>like a person who has been first wronged and through pain is compelled 
<A NAME="91"></A>to be angry; but the other is moved by his own impulse to do wrong, being 
<A NAME="92"></A>carried towards doing something by desire.
<A NAME="93"></A><BR><BR>Since it is possible that thou mayest depart from life this very 
<A NAME="94"></A>moment, regulate every act and thought accordingly. But to go away from 
<A NAME="95"></A>among men, if there are gods, is not a thing to be afraid of, for the gods 
<A NAME="96"></A>will not involve thee in evil; but if indeed they do not exist, or if they 
<A NAME="97"></A>have no concern about human affairs, what is it to me to live in a universe 
<A NAME="98"></A>devoid of gods or devoid of Providence? But in truth they do exist, and 
<A NAME="99"></A>they do care for human things, and they have put all the means in man's 
<A NAME="100"></A>power to enable him not to fall into real evils. And as to the rest, if 
<A NAME="101"></A>there was anything evil, they would have provided for this also, that it 
<A NAME="102"></A>should be altogether in a man's power not to fall into it. Now that which 
<A NAME="103"></A>does not make a man worse, how can it make a man's life worse? But neither 
<A NAME="104"></A>through ignorance, nor having the knowledge, but not the power to guard 
<A NAME="105"></A>against or correct these things, is it possible that the nature of the 
<A NAME="106"></A>universe has overlooked them; nor is it possible that it has made so great 
<A NAME="107"></A>a mistake, either through want of power or want of skill, that good and 
<A NAME="108"></A>evil should happen indiscriminately to the good and the bad. But death 
<A NAME="109"></A>certainly, and life, honour and dishonour, pain and pleasure, all these 
<A NAME="110"></A>things equally happen to good men and bad, being things which make us neither 
<A NAME="111"></A>better nor worse. Therefore they are neither good nor 
<A NAME="112"></A>evil.
<A NAME="113"></A><BR><BR>How quickly all things disappear, in the universe the bodies themselves, 
<A NAME="114"></A>but in time the remembrance of them; what is the nature of all sensible 
<A NAME="115"></A>things, and particularly those which attract with the bait of pleasure 
<A NAME="116"></A>or terrify by pain, or are noised abroad by vapoury fame; how worthless, 
<A NAME="117"></A>and contemptible, and sordid, and perishable, and dead they are- all this 
<A NAME="118"></A>it is the part of the intellectual faculty to observe. To observe too who 
<A NAME="119"></A>these are whose opinions and voices give reputation; what death is, and 
<A NAME="120"></A>the fact that, if a man looks at it in itself, and by the abstractive power 
<A NAME="121"></A>of reflection resolves into their parts all the things which present themselves 
<A NAME="122"></A>to the imagination in it, he will then consider it to be nothing else than 
<A NAME="123"></A>an operation of nature; and if any one is afraid of an operation of nature, 
<A NAME="124"></A>he is a child. This, however, is not only an operation of nature, but it 
<A NAME="125"></A>is also a thing which conduces to the purposes of nature. To observe too 
<A NAME="126"></A>how man comes near to the deity, and by what part of him, and when this 
<A NAME="127"></A>part of man is so disposed.
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR>Nothing is more wretched than a man who traverses everything in 
<A NAME="129"></A>a round, and pries into the things beneath the earth, as the poet says, 
<A NAME="130"></A>and seeks by conjecture what is in the minds of his neighbours, without 
<A NAME="131"></A>perceiving that it is sufficient to attend to the daemon within him, and 
<A NAME="132"></A>to reverence it sincerely. And reverence of the daemon consists in keeping 
<A NAME="133"></A>it pure from passion and thoughtlessness, and dissatisfaction with what 
<A NAME="134"></A>comes from gods and men. For the things from the gods merit veneration 
<A NAME="135"></A>for their excellence; and the things from men should be dear to us by reason 
<A NAME="136"></A>of kinship; and sometimes even, in a manner, they move our pity by reason 
<A NAME="137"></A>of men's ignorance of good and bad; this defect being not less than that 
<A NAME="138"></A>which deprives us of the power of distinguishing things that are white 
<A NAME="139"></A>and black.
<A NAME="140"></A><BR><BR>Though thou shouldst be going to live three thousand years, and 
<A NAME="141"></A>as many times ten thousand years, still remember that no man loses any 
<A NAME="142"></A>other life than this which he now lives, nor lives any other than this 
<A NAME="143"></A>which he now loses. The longest and shortest are thus brought to the same. 
<A NAME="144"></A>For the present is the same to all, though that which perishes is not the 
<A NAME="145"></A>same; and so that which is lost appears to be a mere moment. For a man 
<A NAME="146"></A>cannot lose either the past or the future: for what a man has not, how 
<A NAME="147"></A>can any one take this from him? These two things then thou must bear in 
<A NAME="148"></A>mind; the one, that all things from eternity are of like forms and come 
<A NAME="149"></A>round in a circle, and that it makes no difference whether a man shall 
<A NAME="150"></A>see the same things during a hundred years or two hundred, or an infinite 
<A NAME="151"></A>time; and the second, that the longest liver and he who will die soonest 
<A NAME="152"></A>lose just the same. For the present is the only thing of which a man can 
<A NAME="153"></A>be deprived, if it is true that this is the only thing which he has, and 
<A NAME="154"></A>that a man cannot lose a thing if he has it not.
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR>Remember that all is opinion. For what was said by the Cynic Monimus 
<A NAME="156"></A>is manifest: and manifest too is the use of what was said, if a man receives 
<A NAME="157"></A>what may be got out of it as far as it is true.
<A NAME="158"></A><BR><BR>The soul of man does violence to itself, first of all, when it 
<A NAME="159"></A>becomes an abscess and, as it were, a tumour on the universe, so far as 
<A NAME="160"></A>it can. For to be vexed at anything which happens is a separation of ourselves 
<A NAME="161"></A>from nature, in some part of which the natures of all other things are 
<A NAME="162"></A>contained. In the next place, the soul does violence to itself when it 
<A NAME="163"></A>turns away from any man, or even moves towards him with the intention of 
<A NAME="164"></A>injuring, such as are the souls of those who are angry. In the third place, 
<A NAME="165"></A>the soul does violence to itself when it is overpowered by pleasure or 
<A NAME="166"></A>by pain. Fourthly, when it plays a part, and does or says anything insincerely 
<A NAME="167"></A>and untruly. Fifthly, when it allows any act of its own and any movement 
<A NAME="168"></A>to be without an aim, and does anything thoughtlessly and without considering 
<A NAME="169"></A>what it is, it being right that even the smallest things be done with reference 
<A NAME="170"></A>to an end; and the end of rational animals is to follow the reason and 
<A NAME="171"></A>the law of the most ancient city and polity.
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR>Of human life the time is a point, and the substance is in a flux, 
<A NAME="173"></A>and the perception dull, and the composition of the whole body subject 
<A NAME="174"></A>to putrefaction, and the soul a whirl, and fortune hard to divine, and 
<A NAME="175"></A>fame a thing devoid of judgement. And, to say all in a word, everything 
<A NAME="176"></A>which belongs to the body is a stream, and what belongs to the soul is 
<A NAME="177"></A>a dream and vapour, and life is a warfare and a stranger's sojourn, and 
<A NAME="178"></A>after-fame is oblivion. What then is that which is able to conduct a man? 
<A NAME="179"></A>One thing and only one, philosophy. But this consists in keeping the daemon 
<A NAME="180"></A>within a man free from violence and unharmed, superior to pains and pleasures, 
<A NAME="181"></A>doing nothing without purpose, nor yet falsely and with hypocrisy, not 
<A NAME="182"></A>feeling the need of another man's doing or not doing anything; and besides, 
<A NAME="183"></A>accepting all that happens, and all that is allotted, as coming from thence, 
<A NAME="184"></A>wherever it is, from whence he himself came; and, finally, waiting for 
<A NAME="185"></A>death with a cheerful mind, as being nothing else than a dissolution of 
<A NAME="186"></A>the elements of which every living being is compounded. But if there is 
<A NAME="187"></A>no harm to the elements themselves in each continually changing into another, 
<A NAME="188"></A>why should a man have any apprehension about the change and dissolution 
<A NAME="189"></A>of all the elements? For it is according to nature, and nothing is evil 
<A NAME="190"></A>which is according to nature.
<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR>This in Carnuntum.
