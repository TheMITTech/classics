<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Wilt thou, then, my soul, never be good and simple and one and naked, more 
<A NAME="11"></A>manifest than the body which surrounds thee? Wilt thou never enjoy an affectionate 
<A NAME="12"></A>and contented disposition? Wilt thou never be full and without a want of 
<A NAME="13"></A>any kind, longing for nothing more, nor desiring anything, either animate 
<A NAME="14"></A>or inanimate, for the enjoyment of pleasures? Nor yet desiring time wherein 
<A NAME="15"></A>thou shalt have longer enjoyment, or place, or pleasant climate, or society 
<A NAME="16"></A>of men with whom thou mayest live in harmony? But wilt thou be satisfied 
<A NAME="17"></A>with thy present condition, and pleased with all that is about thee, and 
<A NAME="18"></A>wilt thou convince thyself that thou hast everything and that it comes 
<A NAME="19"></A>from the gods, that everything is well for thee, and will be well whatever 
<A NAME="20"></A>shall please them, and whatever they shall give for the conservation of 
<A NAME="21"></A>the perfect living being, the good and just and beautiful, which generates 
<A NAME="22"></A>and holds together all things, and contains and embraces all things which 
<A NAME="23"></A>are dissolved for the production of other like things? Wilt thou never 
<A NAME="24"></A>be such that thou shalt so dwell in community with gods and men as neither 
<A NAME="25"></A>to find fault with them at all, nor to be condemned by 
<A NAME="26"></A>them?
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR>Observe what thy nature requires, so far as thou art governed by 
<A NAME="28"></A>nature only: then do it and accept it, if thy nature, so far as thou art 
<A NAME="29"></A>a living being, shall not be made worse by it.
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>And next thou must observe what thy nature requires so far as thou 
<A NAME="31"></A>art a living being. And all this thou mayest allow thyself, if thy nature, 
<A NAME="32"></A>so far as thou art a rational animal, shall not be made worse by it. But 
<A NAME="33"></A>the rational animal is consequently also a political (social) animal. Use 
<A NAME="34"></A>these rules, then, and trouble thyself about nothing 
<A NAME="35"></A>else.
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR>Everything which happens either happens in such wise as thou art 
<A NAME="37"></A>formed by nature to bear it, or as thou art not formed by nature to bear 
<A NAME="38"></A>it. If, then, it happens to thee in such way as thou art formed by nature 
<A NAME="39"></A>to bear it, do not complain, but bear it as thou art formed by nature to 
<A NAME="40"></A>bear it. But if it happens in such wise as thou art not formed by nature 
<A NAME="41"></A>to bear it, do not complain, for it will perish after it has consumed thee. 
<A NAME="42"></A>Remember, however, that thou art formed by nature to bear everything, with 
<A NAME="43"></A>respect to which it depends on thy own opinion to make it endurable and 
<A NAME="44"></A>tolerable, by thinking that it is either thy interest or thy duty to do 
<A NAME="45"></A>this.
<A NAME="46"></A><BR><BR>If a man is mistaken, instruct him kindly and show him his error. 
<A NAME="47"></A>But if thou art not able, blame thyself, or blame not even 
<A NAME="48"></A>thyself.
<A NAME="49"></A><BR><BR>Whatever may happen to thee, it was prepared for thee from all 
<A NAME="50"></A>eternity; and the implication of causes was from eternity spinning the 
<A NAME="51"></A>thread of thy being, and of that which is incident to 
<A NAME="52"></A>it.
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR>Whether the universe is a concourse of atoms, or nature is a system, 
<A NAME="54"></A>let this first be established, that I am a part of the whole which is governed 
<A NAME="55"></A>by nature; next, I am in a manner intimately related to the parts which 
<A NAME="56"></A>are of the same kind with myself. For remembering this, inasmuch as I am 
<A NAME="57"></A>a part, I shall be discontented with none of the things which are assigned 
<A NAME="58"></A>to me out of the whole; for nothing is injurious to the part, if it is 
<A NAME="59"></A>for the advantage of the whole. For the whole contains nothing which is 
<A NAME="60"></A>not for its advantage; and all natures indeed have this common principle, 
<A NAME="61"></A>but the nature of the universe has this principle besides, that it cannot 
<A NAME="62"></A>be compelled even by any external cause to generate anything harmful to 
<A NAME="63"></A>itself. By remembering, then, that I am a part of such a whole, I shall 
<A NAME="64"></A>be content with everything that happens. And inasmuch as I am in a manner 
<A NAME="65"></A>intimately related to the parts which are of the same kind with myself, 
<A NAME="66"></A>I shall do nothing unsocial, but I shall rather direct myself to the things 
<A NAME="67"></A>which are of the same kind with myself, and I shall turn an my efforts 
<A NAME="68"></A>to the common interest, and divert them from the contrary. Now, if these 
<A NAME="69"></A>things are done so, life must flow on happily, just as thou mayest observe 
<A NAME="70"></A>that the life of a citizen is happy, who continues a course of action which 
<A NAME="71"></A>is advantageous to his fellow-citizens, and is content with whatever the 
<A NAME="72"></A>state may assign to him.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>The parts of the whole, everything, I mean, which is naturally 
<A NAME="74"></A>comprehended in the universe, must of necessity perish; but let this be 
<A NAME="75"></A>understood in this sense, that they must undergo change. But if this is 
<A NAME="76"></A>naturally both an evil and a necessity for the parts, the whole would not 
<A NAME="77"></A>continue to exist in a good condition, the parts being subject to change 
<A NAME="78"></A>and constituted so as to perish in various ways. For whether did nature 
<A NAME="79"></A>herself design to do evil to the things which are parts of herself, and 
<A NAME="80"></A>to make them subject to evil and of necessity fall into evil, or have such 
<A NAME="81"></A>results happened without her knowing it? Both these suppositions, indeed, 
<A NAME="82"></A>are incredible. But if a man should even drop the term Nature (as an efficient 
<A NAME="83"></A>power), and should speak of these things as natural, even then it would 
<A NAME="84"></A>be ridiculous to affirm at the same time that the parts of the whole are 
<A NAME="85"></A>in their nature subject to change, and at the same time to be surprised 
<A NAME="86"></A>or vexed as if something were happening contrary to nature, particularly 
<A NAME="87"></A>as the dissolution of things is into those things of which each thing is 
<A NAME="88"></A>composed. For there is either a dispersion of the elements out of which 
<A NAME="89"></A>everything has been compounded, or a change from the solid to the earthy 
<A NAME="90"></A>and from the airy to the aerial, so that these parts are taken back into 
<A NAME="91"></A>the universal reason, whether this at certain periods is consumed by fire 
<A NAME="92"></A>or renewed by eternal changes. And do not imagine that the solid and the 
<A NAME="93"></A>airy part belong to thee from the time of generation. For all this received 
<A NAME="94"></A>its accretion only yesterday and the day before, as one may say, from the 
<A NAME="95"></A>food and the air which is inspired. This, then, which has received the 
<A NAME="96"></A>accretion, changes, not that which thy mother brought forth. But suppose 
<A NAME="97"></A>that this which thy mother brought forth implicates thee very much with 
<A NAME="98"></A>that other part, which has the peculiar quality of change, this is nothing 
<A NAME="99"></A>in fact in the way of objection to what is said.
<A NAME="100"></A><BR><BR>When thou hast assumed these names, good, modest, true, rational, 
<A NAME="101"></A>a man of equanimity, and magnanimous, take care that thou dost not change 
<A NAME="102"></A>these names; and if thou shouldst lose them, quickly return to them. And 
<A NAME="103"></A>remember that the term Rational was intended to signify a discriminating 
<A NAME="104"></A>attention to every several thing and freedom from negligence; and that 
<A NAME="105"></A>Equanimity is the voluntary acceptance of the things which are assigned 
<A NAME="106"></A>to thee by the common nature; and that Magnanimity is the elevation of 
<A NAME="107"></A>the intelligent part above the pleasurable or painful sensations of the 
<A NAME="108"></A>flesh, and above that poor thing called fame, and death, and all such things. 
<A NAME="109"></A>If, then, thou maintainest thyself in the possession of these names, without 
<A NAME="110"></A>desiring to be called by these names by others, thou wilt be another person 
<A NAME="111"></A>and wilt enter on another life. For to continue to be such as thou hast 
<A NAME="112"></A>hitherto been, and to be tom in pieces and defiled in such a life, is the 
<A NAME="113"></A>character of a very stupid man and one overfond of his life, and like those 
<A NAME="114"></A>half-devoured fighters with wild beasts, who though covered with wounds 
<A NAME="115"></A>and gore, still intreat to be kept to the following day, though they will 
<A NAME="116"></A>be exposed in the same state to the same claws and bites. Therefore fix 
<A NAME="117"></A>thyself in the possession of these few names: and if thou art able to abide 
<A NAME="118"></A>in them, abide as if thou wast removed to certain islands of the Happy. 
<A NAME="119"></A>But if thou shalt perceive that thou fallest out of them and dost not maintain 
<A NAME="120"></A>thy hold, go courageously into some nook where thou shalt maintain them, 
<A NAME="121"></A>or even depart at once from life, not in passion, but with simplicity and 
<A NAME="122"></A>freedom and modesty, after doing this one laudable thing at least in thy 
<A NAME="123"></A>life, to have gone out of it thus. In order, however, to the remembrance 
<A NAME="124"></A>of these names, it will greatly help thee, if thou rememberest the gods, 
<A NAME="125"></A>and that they wish not to be flattered, but wish all reasonable beings 
<A NAME="126"></A>to be made like themselves; and if thou rememberest that what does the 
<A NAME="127"></A>work of a fig-tree is a fig-tree, and that what does the work of a dog 
<A NAME="128"></A>is a dog, and that what does the work of a bee is a bee, and that what 
<A NAME="129"></A>does the work of a man is a man.
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR>Mimi, war, astonishment, torpor, slavery, will daily wipe out those 
<A NAME="131"></A>holy principles of thine. How many things without studying nature dost 
<A NAME="132"></A>thou imagine, and how many dost thou neglect? But it is thy duty so to 
<A NAME="133"></A>look on and so to do everything, that at the same time the power of dealing 
<A NAME="134"></A>with circumstances is perfected, and the contemplative faculty is exercised, 
<A NAME="135"></A>and the confidence which comes from the knowledge of each several thing 
<A NAME="136"></A>is maintained without showing it, but yet not concealed. For when wilt 
<A NAME="137"></A>thou enjoy simplicity, when gravity, and when the knowledge of every several 
<A NAME="138"></A>thing, both what it is in substance, and what place it has in the universe, 
<A NAME="139"></A>and how long it is formed to exist and of what things it is compounded, 
<A NAME="140"></A>and to whom it can belong, and who are able both to give it and take it 
<A NAME="141"></A>away?
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR>A spider is proud when it has caught a fly, and another when he 
<A NAME="143"></A>has caught a poor hare, and another when he has taken a little fish in 
<A NAME="144"></A>a net, and another when he has taken wild boars, and another when he has 
<A NAME="145"></A>taken bears, and another when he has taken Sarmatians. Are not these robbers, 
<A NAME="146"></A>if thou examinest their opinions?
<A NAME="147"></A><BR><BR>Acquire the contemplative way of seeing how all things change into 
<A NAME="148"></A>one another, and constantly attend to it, and exercise thyself about this 
<A NAME="149"></A>part of philosophy. For nothing is so much adapted to produce magnanimity. 
<A NAME="150"></A>Such a man has put off the body, and as he sees that he must, no one knows 
<A NAME="151"></A>how soon, go away from among men and leave everything here, he gives himself 
<A NAME="152"></A>up entirely to just doing in all his actions, and in everything else that 
<A NAME="153"></A>happens he resigns himself to the universal nature. But as to what any 
<A NAME="154"></A>man shall say or think about him or do against him, he never even thinks 
<A NAME="155"></A>of it, being himself contented with these two things, with acting justly 
<A NAME="156"></A>in what he now does, and being satisfied with what is now assigned to him; 
<A NAME="157"></A>and he lays aside all distracting and busy pursuits, and desires nothing 
<A NAME="158"></A>else than to accomplish the straight course through the law, and by accomplishing 
<A NAME="159"></A>the straight course to follow God.
<A NAME="160"></A><BR><BR>What need is there of suspicious fear, since it is in thy power 
<A NAME="161"></A>to inquire what ought to be done? And if thou seest clear, go by this way 
<A NAME="162"></A>content, without turning back: but if thou dost not see clear, stop and 
<A NAME="163"></A>take the best advisers. But if any other things oppose thee, go on according 
<A NAME="164"></A>to thy powers with due consideration, keeping to that which appears to 
<A NAME="165"></A>be just. For it is best to reach this object, and if thou dost fail, let 
<A NAME="166"></A>thy failure be in attempting this. He who follows reason in all things 
<A NAME="167"></A>is both tranquil and active at the same time, and also cheerful and 
<A NAME="168"></A>collected.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>Inquire of thyself as soon as thou wakest from sleep, whether it 
<A NAME="170"></A>will make any difference to thee, if another does what is just and right. 
<A NAME="171"></A>It will make no difference.
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR>Thou hast not forgotten, I suppose, that those who assume arrogant 
<A NAME="173"></A>airs in bestowing their praise or blame on others, are such as they are 
<A NAME="174"></A>at bed and at board, and thou hast not forgotten what they do, and what 
<A NAME="175"></A>they avoid and what they pursue, and how they steal and how they rob, not 
<A NAME="176"></A>with hands and feet, but with their most valuable part, by means of which 
<A NAME="177"></A>there is produced, when a man chooses, fidelity, modesty, truth, law, a 
<A NAME="178"></A>good daemon (happiness)?
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR>To her who gives and takes back all, to nature, the man who is 
<A NAME="180"></A>instructed and modest says, Give what thou wilt; take back what thou wilt. 
<A NAME="181"></A>And he says this not proudly, but obediently and well pleased with 
<A NAME="182"></A>her.
<A NAME="183"></A><BR><BR>Short is the little which remains to thee of life. Live as on a 
<A NAME="184"></A>mountain. For it makes no difference whether a man lives there or here, 
<A NAME="185"></A>if he lives everywhere in the world as in a state (political community). 
<A NAME="186"></A>Let men see, let them know a real man who lives according to nature. If 
<A NAME="187"></A>they cannot endure him, let them kill him. For that is better than to live 
<A NAME="188"></A>thus as men do.
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR>No longer talk at all about the kind of man that a good man ought 
<A NAME="190"></A>to be, but be such.
<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR>Constantly contemplate the whole of time and the whole of substance, 
<A NAME="192"></A>and consider that all individual things as to substance are a grain of 
<A NAME="193"></A>a fig, and as to time, the turning of a gimlet.
<A NAME="194"></A><BR><BR>Look at everything that exists, and observe that it is already 
<A NAME="195"></A>in dissolution and in change, and as it were putrefaction or dispersion, 
<A NAME="196"></A>or that everything is so constituted by nature as to 
<A NAME="197"></A>die.
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR>Consider what men are when they are eating, sleeping, generating, 
<A NAME="199"></A>easing themselves and so forth. Then what kind of men they are when they 
<A NAME="200"></A>are imperious and arrogant, or angry and scolding from their elevated place. 
<A NAME="201"></A>But a short time ago to how many they were slaves and for what things; 
<A NAME="202"></A>and after a little time consider in what a condition they will 
<A NAME="203"></A>be.
<A NAME="204"></A><BR><BR>That is for the good of each thing, which the universal nature 
<A NAME="205"></A>brings to each. And it is for its good at the time when nature brings 
<A NAME="206"></A>it.
<A NAME="207"></A><BR><BR>"The earth loves the shower"; and "the solemn aether loves": and 
<A NAME="208"></A>the universe loves to make whatever is about to be. I say then to the universe, 
<A NAME="209"></A>that I love as thou lovest. And is not this too said, that "this or that 
<A NAME="210"></A>loves (is wont) to be produced"?
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR>Either thou livest here and hast already accustomed thyself to 
<A NAME="212"></A>it, or thou art going away, and this was thy own will; or thou art dying 
<A NAME="213"></A>and hast discharged thy duty. But besides these things there is nothing. 
<A NAME="214"></A>Be of good cheer, then.
<A NAME="215"></A><BR><BR>Let this always be plain to thee, that this piece of land is like 
<A NAME="216"></A>any other; and that all things here are the same with things on top of 
<A NAME="217"></A>a mountain, or on the sea-shore, or wherever thou choosest to be. For thou 
<A NAME="218"></A>wilt find just what Plato says, Dwelling within the walls of a city as 
<A NAME="219"></A>in a shepherd's fold on a mountain.
<A NAME="220"></A><BR><BR>What is my ruling faculty now to me? And of what nature am I now 
<A NAME="221"></A>making it? And for what purpose am I now using it? Is it void of understanding? 
<A NAME="222"></A>Is it loosed and rent asunder from social life? Is it melted into and mixed 
<A NAME="223"></A>with the poor flesh so as to move together with it?
<A NAME="224"></A><BR><BR>He who flies from his master is a runaway; but the law is master, 
<A NAME="225"></A>and he who breaks the law is a runaway. And he also who is grieved or angry 
<A NAME="226"></A>or afraid, is dissatisfied because something has been or is or shall be 
<A NAME="227"></A>of the things which are appointed by him who rules all things, and he is 
<A NAME="228"></A>Law, and assigns to every man what is fit. He then who fears or is grieved 
<A NAME="229"></A>or is angry is a runaway.
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR>A man deposits seed in a womb and goes away, and then another cause 
<A NAME="231"></A>takes it, and labours on it and makes a child. What a thing from such a 
<A NAME="232"></A>material! Again, the child passes food down through the throat, and then 
<A NAME="233"></A>another cause takes it and makes perception and motion, and in fine life 
<A NAME="234"></A>and strength and other things; how many and how strange I Observe then 
<A NAME="235"></A>the things which are produced in such a hidden way, and see the power just 
<A NAME="236"></A>as we see the power which carries things downwards and upwards, not with 
<A NAME="237"></A>the eyes, but still no less plainly.
<A NAME="238"></A><BR><BR>Constantly consider how all things such as they now are, in time 
<A NAME="239"></A>past also were; and consider that they will be the same again. And place 
<A NAME="240"></A>before thy eyes entire dramas and stages of the same form, whatever thou 
<A NAME="241"></A>hast learned from thy experience or from older history; for example, the 
<A NAME="242"></A>whole court of Hadrian, and the whole court of Antoninus, and the whole 
<A NAME="243"></A>court of Philip, Alexander, Croesus; for all those were such dramas as 
<A NAME="244"></A>we see now, only with different actors.
<A NAME="245"></A><BR><BR>Imagine every man who is grieved at anything or discontented to 
<A NAME="246"></A>be like a pig which is sacrificed and kicks and screams.
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR>Like this pig also is he who on his bed in silence laments the 
<A NAME="248"></A>bonds in which we are held. And consider that only to the rational animal 
<A NAME="249"></A>is it given to follow voluntarily what happens; but simply to follow is 
<A NAME="250"></A>a necessity imposed on all.
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR>Severally on the occasion of everything that thou doest, pause 
<A NAME="252"></A>and ask thyself, if death is a dreadful thing because it deprives thee 
<A NAME="253"></A>of this.
<A NAME="254"></A><BR><BR>When thou art offended at any man's fault, forthwith turn to thyself 
<A NAME="255"></A>and reflect in what like manner thou dost err thyself; for example, in 
<A NAME="256"></A>thinking that money is a good thing, or pleasure, or a bit of reputation, 
<A NAME="257"></A>and the like. For by attending to this thou wilt quickly forget thy anger, 
<A NAME="258"></A>if this consideration also is added, that the man is compelled: for what 
<A NAME="259"></A>else could he do? or, if thou art able, take away from him the 
<A NAME="260"></A>compulsion.
<A NAME="261"></A><BR><BR>When thou hast seen Satyron the Socratic, think of either Eutyches 
<A NAME="262"></A>or Hymen, and when thou hast seen Euphrates, think of Eutychion or Silvanus, 
<A NAME="263"></A>and when thou hast seen Alciphron think of Tropaeophorus, and when thou 
<A NAME="264"></A>hast seen Xenophon think of Crito or Severus, and when thou hast looked 
<A NAME="265"></A>on thyself, think of any other Caesar, and in the case of every one do 
<A NAME="266"></A>in like manner. Then let this thought be in thy mind, Where then are those 
<A NAME="267"></A>men? Nowhere, or nobody knows where. For thus continuously thou wilt look 
<A NAME="268"></A>at human things as smoke and nothing at all; especially if thou reflectest 
<A NAME="269"></A>at the same time that what has once changed will never exist again in the 
<A NAME="270"></A>infinite duration of time. But thou, in what a brief space of time is thy 
<A NAME="271"></A>existence? And why art thou not content to pass through this short time 
<A NAME="272"></A>in an orderly way? What matter and opportunity for thy activity art thou 
<A NAME="273"></A>avoiding? For what else are all these things, except exercises for the 
<A NAME="274"></A>reason, when it has viewed carefully and by examination into their nature 
<A NAME="275"></A>the things which happen in life? Persevere then until thou shalt have made 
<A NAME="276"></A>these things thy own, as the stomach which is strengthened makes all things 
<A NAME="277"></A>its own, as the blazing fire makes flame and brightness out of everything 
<A NAME="278"></A>that is thrown into it.
<A NAME="279"></A><BR><BR>Let it not be in any man's power to say truly of thee that thou 
<A NAME="280"></A>art not simple or that thou are not good; but let him be a liar whoever 
<A NAME="281"></A>shall think anything of this kind about thee; and this is altogether in 
<A NAME="282"></A>thy power. For who is he that shall hinder thee from being good and simple? 
<A NAME="283"></A>Do thou only determine to live no longer, unless thou shalt be such. For 
<A NAME="284"></A>neither does reason allow thee to live, if thou art not 
<A NAME="285"></A>such.
<A NAME="286"></A><BR><BR>What is that which as to this material (our life) can be done or 
<A NAME="287"></A>said in the way most conformable to reason. For whatever this may be, it 
<A NAME="288"></A>is in thy power to do it or to say it, and do not make excuses that thou 
<A NAME="289"></A>art hindered. Thou wilt not cease to lament till thy mind is in such a 
<A NAME="290"></A>condition that, what luxury is to those who enjoy pleasure, such shall 
<A NAME="291"></A>be to thee, in the matter which is subjected and presented to thee, the 
<A NAME="292"></A>doing of the things which are conformable to man's constitution; for a 
<A NAME="293"></A>man ought to consider as an enjoyment everything which it is in his power 
<A NAME="294"></A>to do according to his own nature. And it is in his power everywhere. Now, 
<A NAME="295"></A>it is not given to a cylinder to move everywhere by its own motion, nor 
<A NAME="296"></A>yet to water nor to fire, nor to anything else which is governed by nature 
<A NAME="297"></A>or an irrational soul, for the things which check them and stand in the 
<A NAME="298"></A>way are many. But intelligence and reason are able to go through everything 
<A NAME="299"></A>that opposes them, and in such manner as they are formed by nature and 
<A NAME="300"></A>as they choose. Place before thy eyes this facility with which the reason 
<A NAME="301"></A>will be carried through all things, as fire upwards, as a stone downwards, 
<A NAME="302"></A>as a cylinder down an inclined surface, and seek for nothing further. For 
<A NAME="303"></A>all other obstacles either affect the body only which is a dead thing; 
<A NAME="304"></A>or, except through opinion and the yielding of the reason itself, they 
<A NAME="305"></A>do not crush nor do any harm of any kind; for if they did, he who felt 
<A NAME="306"></A>it would immediately become bad. Now, in the case of all things which have 
<A NAME="307"></A>a certain constitution, whatever harm may happen to any of them, that which 
<A NAME="308"></A>is so affected becomes consequently worse; but in the like case, a man 
<A NAME="309"></A>becomes both better, if one may say so, and more worthy of praise by making 
<A NAME="310"></A>a right use of these accidents. And finally remember that nothing harms 
<A NAME="311"></A>him who is really a citizen, which does not harm the state; nor yet does 
<A NAME="312"></A>anything harm the state, which does not harm law (order); and of these 
<A NAME="313"></A>things which are called misfortunes not one harms law. What then does not 
<A NAME="314"></A>harm law does not harm either state or citizen.
<A NAME="315"></A><BR><BR>To him who is penetrated by true principles even the briefest precept 
<A NAME="316"></A>is sufficient, and any common precept, to remind him that he should be 
<A NAME="317"></A>free from grief and fear. For example-
<A NAME="318"></A><BR><BR>Leaves, some the wind scatters on the ground-
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>So is the race of men. Leaves, also, are thy children; and leaves, 
<A NAME="320"></A>too, are they who cry out as if they were worthy of credit and bestow their 
<A NAME="321"></A>praise, or on the contrary curse, or secretly blame and sneer; and leaves, 
<A NAME="322"></A>in like manner, are those who shall receive and transmit a man's fame to 
<A NAME="323"></A>aftertimes. For all such things as these "are produced in the season of 
<A NAME="324"></A>spring," as the poet says; then the wind casts them down; then the forest 
<A NAME="325"></A>produces other leaves in their places. But a brief existence is common 
<A NAME="326"></A>to all things, and yet thou avoidest and pursuest all things as if they 
<A NAME="327"></A>would be eternal. A little time, and thou shalt close thy eyes; and him 
<A NAME="328"></A>who has attended thee to thy grave another soon will 
<A NAME="329"></A>lament.
<A NAME="330"></A><BR><BR>The healthy eye ought to see all visible things and not to say, 
<A NAME="331"></A>I wish for green things; for this is the condition of a diseased eye. And 
<A NAME="332"></A>the healthy hearing and smelling ought to be ready to perceive all that 
<A NAME="333"></A>can be heard and smelled. And the healthy stomach ought to be with respect 
<A NAME="334"></A>to all food just as the mill with respect to all things which it is formed 
<A NAME="335"></A>to grind. And accordingly the healthy understanding ought to be prepared 
<A NAME="336"></A>for everything which happens; but that which says, Let my dear children 
<A NAME="337"></A>live, and let all men praise whatever I may do, is an eye which seeks for 
<A NAME="338"></A>green things, or teeth which seek for soft things.
<A NAME="339"></A><BR><BR>There is no man so fortunate that there shall not be by him when 
<A NAME="340"></A>he is dying some who are pleased with what is going to happen. Suppose 
<A NAME="341"></A>that he was a good and wise man, will there not be at last some one to 
<A NAME="342"></A>say to himself, Let us at last breathe freely being relieved from this 
<A NAME="343"></A>schoolmaster? It is true that he was harsh to none of us, but I perceived 
<A NAME="344"></A>that he tacitly condemns us.- This is what is said of a good man. But in 
<A NAME="345"></A>our own case how many other things are there for which there are many who 
<A NAME="346"></A>wish to get rid of us. Thou wilt consider this then when thou art dying, 
<A NAME="347"></A>and thou wilt depart more contentedly by reflecting thus: I am going away 
<A NAME="348"></A>from such a life, in which even my associates in behalf of whom I have 
<A NAME="349"></A>striven so much, prayed, and cared, themselves wish me to depart, hoping 
<A NAME="350"></A>perchance to get some little advantage by it. Why then should a man cling 
<A NAME="351"></A>to a longer stay here? Do not however for this reason go away less kindly 
<A NAME="352"></A>disposed to them, but preserving thy own character, and friendly and benevolent 
<A NAME="353"></A>and mild, and on the other hand not as if thou wast torn away; but as when 
<A NAME="354"></A>a man dies a quiet death, the poor soul is easily separated from the body, 
<A NAME="355"></A>such also ought thy departure from men to be, for nature united thee to 
<A NAME="356"></A>them and associated thee. But does she now dissolve the union? Well, I 
<A NAME="357"></A>am separated as from kinsmen, not however dragged resisting, but without 
<A NAME="358"></A>compulsion; for this too is one of the things according to 
<A NAME="359"></A>nature.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR>Accustom thyself as much as possible on the occasion of anything 
<A NAME="361"></A>being done by any person to inquire with thyself, For what object is this 
<A NAME="362"></A>man doing this? But begin with thyself, and examine thyself 
<A NAME="363"></A>first.
<A NAME="364"></A><BR><BR>Remember that this which pulls the strings is the thing which is 
<A NAME="365"></A>hidden within: this is the power of persuasion, this is life, this, if 
<A NAME="366"></A>one may so say, is man. In contemplating thyself never include the vessel 
<A NAME="367"></A>which surrounds thee and these instruments which are attached about it. 
<A NAME="368"></A>For they are like to an axe, differing only in this that they grow to the 
<A NAME="369"></A>body. For indeed there is no more use in these parts without the cause 
<A NAME="370"></A>which moves and checks them than in the weaver's shuttle, and the writer's 
<A NAME="371"></A>pen and the driver's whip.
