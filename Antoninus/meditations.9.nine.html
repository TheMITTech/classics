<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>He ho acts unjustly acts impiously. For since the universal nature has 
<A NAME="11"></A>made rational animals for the sake of one another to help one another according 
<A NAME="12"></A>to their deserts, but in no way to injure one another, he who transgresses 
<A NAME="13"></A>her will, is clearly guilty of impiety towards the highest divinity. And 
<A NAME="14"></A>he too who lies is guilty of impiety to the same divinity; for the universal 
<A NAME="15"></A>nature is the nature of things that are; and things that are have a relation 
<A NAME="16"></A>to all things that come into existence. And further, this universal nature 
<A NAME="17"></A>is named truth, and is the prime cause of all things that are true. He 
<A NAME="18"></A>then who lies intentionally is guilty of impiety inasmuch as he acts unjustly 
<A NAME="19"></A>by deceiving; and he also who lies unintentionally, inasmuch as he is at 
<A NAME="20"></A>variance with the universal nature, and inasmuch as he disturbs the order 
<A NAME="21"></A>by fighting against the nature of the world; for he fights against it, 
<A NAME="22"></A>who is moved of himself to that which is contrary to truth, for he had 
<A NAME="23"></A>received powers from nature through the neglect of which he is not able 
<A NAME="24"></A>now to distinguish falsehood from truth. And indeed he who pursues pleasure 
<A NAME="25"></A>as good, and avoids pain as evil, is guilty of impiety. For of necessity 
<A NAME="26"></A>such a man must often find fault with the universal nature, alleging that 
<A NAME="27"></A>it assigns things to the bad and the good contrary to their deserts, because 
<A NAME="28"></A>frequently the bad are in the enjoyment of pleasure and possess the things 
<A NAME="29"></A>which procure pleasure, but the good have pain for their share and the 
<A NAME="30"></A>things which cause pain. And further, he who is afraid of pain will sometimes 
<A NAME="31"></A>also be afraid of some of the things which will happen in the world, and 
<A NAME="32"></A>even this is impiety. And he who pursues pleasure will not abstain from 
<A NAME="33"></A>injustice, and this is plainly impiety. Now with respect to the things 
<A NAME="34"></A>towards which the universal nature is equally affected- for it would not 
<A NAME="35"></A>have made both, unless it was equally affected towards both- towards these 
<A NAME="36"></A>they who wish to follow nature should be of the same mind with it, and 
<A NAME="37"></A>equally affected. With respect to pain, then, and pleasure, or death and 
<A NAME="38"></A>life, or honour and dishonour, which the universal nature employs equally, 
<A NAME="39"></A>whoever is not equally affected is manifestly acting impiously. And I say 
<A NAME="40"></A>that the universal nature employs them equally, instead of saying that 
<A NAME="41"></A>they happen alike to those who are produced in continuous series and to 
<A NAME="42"></A>those who come after them by virtue of a certain original movement of Providence, 
<A NAME="43"></A>according to which it moved from a certain beginning to this ordering of 
<A NAME="44"></A>things, having conceived certain principles of the things which were to 
<A NAME="45"></A>be, and having determined powers productive of beings and of changes and 
<A NAME="46"></A>of such like successions.
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR>It would be a man's happiest lot to depart from mankind without 
<A NAME="48"></A>having had any taste of lying and hypocrisy and luxury and pride. However 
<A NAME="49"></A>to breathe out one's life when a man has had enough of these things is 
<A NAME="50"></A>the next best voyage, as the saying is. Hast thou determined to abide with 
<A NAME="51"></A>vice, and has not experience yet induced thee to fly from this pestilence? 
<A NAME="52"></A>For the destruction of the understanding is a pestilence, much more indeed 
<A NAME="53"></A>than any such corruption and change of this atmosphere which surrounds 
<A NAME="54"></A>us. For this corruption is a pestilence of animals so far as they are animals; 
<A NAME="55"></A>but the other is a pestilence of men so far as they are 
<A NAME="56"></A>men.
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR>Do not despise death, but be well content with it, since this too 
<A NAME="58"></A>is one of those things which nature wills. For such as it is to be young 
<A NAME="59"></A>and to grow old, and to increase and to reach maturity, and to have teeth 
<A NAME="60"></A>and beard and grey hairs, and to beget, and to be pregnant and to bring 
<A NAME="61"></A>forth, and all the other natural operations which the seasons of thy life 
<A NAME="62"></A>bring, such also is dissolution. This, then, is consistent with the character 
<A NAME="63"></A>of a reflecting man, to be neither careless nor impatient nor contemptuous 
<A NAME="64"></A>with respect to death, but to wait for it as one of the operations of nature. 
<A NAME="65"></A>As thou now waitest for the time when the child shall come out of thy wife's 
<A NAME="66"></A>womb, so be ready for the time when thy soul shall fall out of this envelope. 
<A NAME="67"></A>But if thou requirest also a vulgar kind of comfort which shall reach thy 
<A NAME="68"></A>heart, thou wilt be made best reconciled to death by observing the objects 
<A NAME="69"></A>from which thou art going to be removed, and the morals of those with whom 
<A NAME="70"></A>thy soul will no longer be mingled. For it is no way right to be offended 
<A NAME="71"></A>with men, but it is thy duty to care for them and to bear with them gently; 
<A NAME="72"></A>and yet to remember that thy departure will be not from men who have the 
<A NAME="73"></A>same principles as thyself. For this is the only thing, if there be any, 
<A NAME="74"></A>which could draw us the contrary way and attach us to life, to be permitted 
<A NAME="75"></A>to live with those who have the same principles as ourselves. But now thou 
<A NAME="76"></A>seest how great is the trouble arising from the discordance of those who 
<A NAME="77"></A>live together, so that thou mayest say, Come quick, O death, lest perchance 
<A NAME="78"></A>I, too, should forget myself.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>He who does wrong does wrong against himself. He who acts unjustly 
<A NAME="80"></A>acts unjustly to himself, because he makes himself bad.
<A NAME="81"></A><BR><BR>He often acts unjustly who does not do a certain thing; not only 
<A NAME="82"></A>he who does a certain thing.
<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR>Thy present opinion founded on understanding, and thy present conduct 
<A NAME="84"></A>directed to social good, and thy present disposition of contentment with 
<A NAME="85"></A>everything which happens- that is enough.
<A NAME="86"></A><BR><BR>Wipe out imagination: check desire: extinguish appetite: keep the 
<A NAME="87"></A>ruling faculty in its own power.
<A NAME="88"></A><BR><BR>Among the animals which have not reason one life is distributed; 
<A NAME="89"></A>but among reasonable animals one intelligent soul is distributed: just 
<A NAME="90"></A>as there is one earth of all things which are of an earthy nature, and 
<A NAME="91"></A>we see by one light, and breathe one air, all of us that have the faculty 
<A NAME="92"></A>of vision and all that have life.
<A NAME="93"></A><BR><BR>All things which participate in anything which is common to them 
<A NAME="94"></A>all move towards that which is of the same kind with themselves. Everything 
<A NAME="95"></A>which is earthy turns towards the earth, everything which is liquid flows 
<A NAME="96"></A>together, and everything which is of an aerial kind does the same, so that 
<A NAME="97"></A>they require something to keep them asunder, and the application of force. 
<A NAME="98"></A>Fire indeed moves upwards on account of the elemental fire, but it is so 
<A NAME="99"></A>ready to be kindled together with all the fire which is here, that even 
<A NAME="100"></A>every substance which is somewhat dry, is easily ignited, because there 
<A NAME="101"></A>is less mingled with it of that which is a hindrance to ignition. Accordingly 
<A NAME="102"></A>then everything also which participates in the common intelligent nature 
<A NAME="103"></A>moves in like manner towards that which is of the same kind with itself, 
<A NAME="104"></A>or moves even more. For so much as it is superior in comparison with all 
<A NAME="105"></A>other things, in the same degree also is it more ready to mingle with and 
<A NAME="106"></A>to be fused with that which is akin to it. Accordingly among animals devoid 
<A NAME="107"></A>of reason we find swarms of bees, and herds of cattle, and the nurture 
<A NAME="108"></A>of young birds, and in a manner, loves; for even in animals there are souls, 
<A NAME="109"></A>and that power which brings them together is seen to exert itself in the 
<A NAME="110"></A>superior degree, and in such a way as never has been observed in plants 
<A NAME="111"></A>nor in stones nor in trees. But in rational animals there are political 
<A NAME="112"></A>communities and friendships, and families and meetings of people; and in 
<A NAME="113"></A>wars, treaties and armistices. But in the things which are still superior, 
<A NAME="114"></A>even though they are separated from one another, unity in a manner exists, 
<A NAME="115"></A>as in the stars. Thus the ascent to the higher degree is able to produce 
<A NAME="116"></A>a sympathy even in things which are separated. See, then, what now takes 
<A NAME="117"></A>place. For only intelligent animals have now forgotten this mutual desire 
<A NAME="118"></A>and inclination, and in them alone the property of flowing together is 
<A NAME="119"></A>not seen. But still though men strive to avoid this union, they are caught 
<A NAME="120"></A>and held by it, for their nature is too strong for them; and thou wilt 
<A NAME="121"></A>see what I say, if thou only observest. Sooner, then, will one find anything 
<A NAME="122"></A>earthy which comes in contact with no earthy thing than a man altogether 
<A NAME="123"></A>separated from other men.
<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR>Both man and God and the universe produce fruit; at the proper 
<A NAME="125"></A>seasons each produces it. But if usage has especially fixed these terms 
<A NAME="126"></A>to the vine and like things, this is nothing. Reason produces fruit both 
<A NAME="127"></A>for all and for itself, and there are produced from it other things of 
<A NAME="128"></A>the same kind as reason itself.
<A NAME="129"></A><BR><BR>If thou art able, correct by teaching those who do wrong; but if 
<A NAME="130"></A>thou canst not, remember that indulgence is given to thee for this purpose. 
<A NAME="131"></A>And the gods, too, are indulgent to such persons; and for some purposes 
<A NAME="132"></A>they even help them to get health, wealth, reputation; so kind they are. 
<A NAME="133"></A>And it is in thy power also; or say, who hinders thee?
<A NAME="134"></A><BR><BR>Labour not as one who is wretched, nor yet as one who would be 
<A NAME="135"></A>pitied or admired: but direct thy will to one thing only, to put thyself 
<A NAME="136"></A>in motion and to check thyself, as the social reason 
<A NAME="137"></A>requires.
<A NAME="138"></A><BR><BR>To-day I have got out of all trouble, or rather I have cast out 
<A NAME="139"></A>all trouble, for it was not outside, but within and in my 
<A NAME="140"></A>opinions.
<A NAME="141"></A><BR><BR>All things are the same, familiar in experience, and ephemeral 
<A NAME="142"></A>in time, and worthless in the matter. Everything now is just as it was 
<A NAME="143"></A>in the time of those whom we have buried.
<A NAME="144"></A><BR><BR>Things stand outside of us, themselves by themselves, neither knowing 
<A NAME="145"></A>aught of themselves, nor expressing any judgement. What is it, then, which 
<A NAME="146"></A>does judge about them? The ruling faculty.
<A NAME="147"></A><BR><BR>Not in passivity, but in activity lie the evil and the good of 
<A NAME="148"></A>the rational social animal, just as his virtue and his vice lie not in 
<A NAME="149"></A>passivity, but in activity.
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR>For the stone which has been thrown up it is no evil to come down, 
<A NAME="151"></A>nor indeed any good to have been carried up.
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR>Penetrate inwards into men's leading principles, and thou wilt 
<A NAME="153"></A>see what judges thou art afraid of, and what kind of judges they are of 
<A NAME="154"></A>themselves.
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR>All things are changing: and thou thyself art in continuous mutation 
<A NAME="156"></A>and in a manner in continuous destruction, and the whole universe 
<A NAME="157"></A>too.
<A NAME="158"></A><BR><BR>It is thy duty to leave another man's wrongful act there where 
<A NAME="159"></A>it is.
<A NAME="160"></A><BR><BR>Termination of activity, cessation from movement and opinion, and 
<A NAME="161"></A>in a sense their death, is no evil. Turn thy thoughts now to the consideration 
<A NAME="162"></A>of thy life, thy life as a child, as a youth, thy manhood, thy old age, 
<A NAME="163"></A>for in these also every change was a death. Is this anything to fear? Turn 
<A NAME="164"></A>thy thoughts now to thy life under thy grandfather, then to thy life under 
<A NAME="165"></A>thy mother, then to thy life under thy father; and as thou findest many 
<A NAME="166"></A>other differences and changes and terminations, ask thyself, Is this anything 
<A NAME="167"></A>to fear? In like manner, then, neither are the termination and cessation 
<A NAME="168"></A>and change of thy whole life a thing to be afraid of.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>Hasten to examine thy own ruling faculty and that of the universe 
<A NAME="170"></A>and that of thy neighbour: thy own that thou mayest make it just: and that 
<A NAME="171"></A>of the universe, that thou mayest remember of what thou art a part; and 
<A NAME="172"></A>that of thy neighbour, that thou mayest know whether he has acted ignorantly 
<A NAME="173"></A>or with knowledge, and that thou mayest also consider that his ruling faculty 
<A NAME="174"></A>is akin to thine.
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR>As thou thyself art a component part of a social system, so let 
<A NAME="176"></A>every act of thine be a component part of social life. Whatever act of 
<A NAME="177"></A>thine then has no reference either immediately or remotely to a social 
<A NAME="178"></A>end, this tears asunder thy life, and does not allow it to be one, and 
<A NAME="179"></A>it is of the nature of a mutiny, just as when in a popular assembly a man 
<A NAME="180"></A>acting by himself stands apart from the general agreement.
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR>Quarrels of little children and their sports, and poor spirits 
<A NAME="182"></A>carrying about dead bodies, such is everything; and so what is exhibited 
<A NAME="183"></A>in the representation of the mansions of the dead strikes our eyes more 
<A NAME="184"></A>clearly.
<A NAME="185"></A><BR><BR>Examine into the quality of the form of an object, and detach it 
<A NAME="186"></A>altogether from its material part, and then contemplate it; then determine 
<A NAME="187"></A>the time, the longest which a thing of this peculiar form is naturally 
<A NAME="188"></A>made to endure.
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR>Thou hast endured infinite troubles through not being contented 
<A NAME="190"></A>with thy ruling faculty, when it does the things which it is constituted 
<A NAME="191"></A>by nature to do. But enough of this.
<A NAME="192"></A><BR><BR>When another blames thee or hates thee, or when men say about thee 
<A NAME="193"></A>anything injurious, approach their poor souls, penetrate within, and see 
<A NAME="194"></A>what kind of men they are. Thou wilt discover that there is no reason to 
<A NAME="195"></A>take any trouble that these men may have this or that opinion about thee. 
<A NAME="196"></A>However thou must be well disposed towards them, for by nature they are 
<A NAME="197"></A>friends. And the gods too aid them in all ways, by dreams, by signs, towards 
<A NAME="198"></A>the attainment of those things on which they set a value.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR>The periodic movements of the universe are the same, up and down 
<A NAME="200"></A>from age to age. And either the universal intelligence puts itself in motion 
<A NAME="201"></A>for every separate effect, and if this is so, be thou content with that 
<A NAME="202"></A>which is the result of its activity; or it puts itself in motion once, 
<A NAME="203"></A>and everything else comes by way of sequence in a manner; or indivisible 
<A NAME="204"></A>elements are the origin of all things.- In a word, if there is a god, all 
<A NAME="205"></A>is well; and if chance rules, do not thou also be governed by 
<A NAME="206"></A>it.
<A NAME="207"></A><BR><BR>Soon will the earth cover us all: then the earth, too, will change, 
<A NAME="208"></A>and the things also which result from change will continue to change for 
<A NAME="209"></A>ever, and these again for ever. For if a man reflects on the changes and 
<A NAME="210"></A>transformations which follow one another like wave after wave and their 
<A NAME="211"></A>rapidity, he will despise everything which is perishable.
<A NAME="212"></A><BR><BR>The universal cause is like a winter torrent: it carries everything 
<A NAME="213"></A>along with it. But how worthless are all these poor people who are engaged 
<A NAME="214"></A>in matters political, and, as they suppose, are playing the philosopher! 
<A NAME="215"></A>All drivellers. Well then, man: do what nature now requires. Set thyself 
<A NAME="216"></A>in motion, if it is in thy power, and do not look about thee to see if 
<A NAME="217"></A>any one will observe it; nor yet expect Plato's Republic: but be content 
<A NAME="218"></A>if the smallest thing goes on well, and consider such an event to be no 
<A NAME="219"></A>small matter. For who can change men's opinions? And without a change of 
<A NAME="220"></A>opinions what else is there than the slavery of men who groan while they 
<A NAME="221"></A>pretend to obey? Come now and tell me of Alexander and Philip and Demetrius 
<A NAME="222"></A>of Phalerum. They themselves shall judge whether they discovered what the 
<A NAME="223"></A>common nature required, and trained themselves accordingly. But if they 
<A NAME="224"></A>acted like tragedy heroes, no one has condemned me to imitate them. Simple 
<A NAME="225"></A>and modest is the work of philosophy. Draw me not aside to indolence and 
<A NAME="226"></A>pride.
<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR>Look down from above on the countless herds of men and their countless 
<A NAME="228"></A>solemnities, and the infinitely varied voyagings in storms and calms, and 
<A NAME="229"></A>the differences among those who are born, who live together, and die. And 
<A NAME="230"></A>consider, too, the life lived by others in olden time, and the life of 
<A NAME="231"></A>those who will live after thee, and the life now lived among barbarous 
<A NAME="232"></A>nations, and how many know not even thy name, and how many will soon forget 
<A NAME="233"></A>it, and how they who perhaps now are praising thee will very soon blame 
<A NAME="234"></A>thee, and that neither a posthumous name is of any value, nor reputation, 
<A NAME="235"></A>nor anything else.
<A NAME="236"></A><BR><BR>Let there be freedom from perturbations with respect to the things 
<A NAME="237"></A>which come from the external cause; and let there be justice in the things 
<A NAME="238"></A>done by virtue of the internal cause, that is, let there be movement and 
<A NAME="239"></A>action terminating in this, in social acts, for this is according to thy 
<A NAME="240"></A>nature.
<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR>Thou canst remove out of the way many useless things among those 
<A NAME="242"></A>which disturb thee, for they lie entirely in thy opinion; and thou wilt 
<A NAME="243"></A>then gain for thyself ample space by comprehending the whole universe in 
<A NAME="244"></A>thy mind, and by contemplating the eternity of time, and observing the 
<A NAME="245"></A>rapid change of every several thing, how short is the time from birth to 
<A NAME="246"></A>dissolution, and the illimitable time before birth as well as the equally 
<A NAME="247"></A>boundless time after dissolution.
<A NAME="248"></A><BR><BR>All that thou seest will quickly perish, and those who have been 
<A NAME="249"></A>spectators of its dissolution will very soon perish too. And he who dies 
<A NAME="250"></A>at the extremest old age will be brought into the same condition with him 
<A NAME="251"></A>who died prematurely.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR>What are these men's leading principles, and about what kind of 
<A NAME="253"></A>things are they busy, and for what kind of reasons do they love and honour? 
<A NAME="254"></A>Imagine that thou seest their poor souls laid bare. When they think that 
<A NAME="255"></A>they do harm by their blame or good by their praise, what an 
<A NAME="256"></A>idea!
<A NAME="257"></A><BR><BR>Loss is nothing else than change. But the universal nature delights 
<A NAME="258"></A>in change, and in obedience to her all things are now done well, and from 
<A NAME="259"></A>eternity have been done in like form, and will be such to time without 
<A NAME="260"></A>end. What, then, dost thou say? That all things have been and all things 
<A NAME="261"></A>always will be bad, and that no power has ever been found in so many gods 
<A NAME="262"></A>to rectify these things, but the world has been condemned to be found in 
<A NAME="263"></A>never ceasing evil?
<A NAME="264"></A><BR><BR>The rottenness of the matter which is the foundation of everything! 
<A NAME="265"></A>Water, dust, bones, filth: or again, marble rocks, the callosities of the 
<A NAME="266"></A>earth; and gold and silver, the sediments; and garments, only bits of hair; 
<A NAME="267"></A>and purple dye, blood; and everything else is of the same kind. And that 
<A NAME="268"></A>which is of the nature of breath is also another thing of the same kind, 
<A NAME="269"></A>changing from this to that.
<A NAME="270"></A><BR><BR>Enough of this wretched life and murmuring and apish tricks. Why 
<A NAME="271"></A>art thou disturbed? What is there new in this? What unsettles thee? Is 
<A NAME="272"></A>it the form of the thing? Look at it. Or is it the matter? Look at it. 
<A NAME="273"></A>But besides these there is nothing. Towards the gods, then, now become 
<A NAME="274"></A>at last more simple and better. It is the same whether we examine these 
<A NAME="275"></A>things for a hundred years or three.
<A NAME="276"></A><BR><BR>If any man has done wrong, the harm is his own. But perhaps he 
<A NAME="277"></A>has not done wrong.
<A NAME="278"></A><BR><BR>Either all things proceed from one intelligent source and come 
<A NAME="279"></A>together as in one body, and the part ought not to find fault with what 
<A NAME="280"></A>is done for the benefit of the whole; or there are only atoms, and nothing 
<A NAME="281"></A>else than mixture and dispersion. Why, then, art thou disturbed? Say to 
<A NAME="282"></A>the ruling faculty, Art thou dead, art thou corrupted, art thou playing 
<A NAME="283"></A>the hypocrite, art thou become a beast, dost thou herd and feed with the 
<A NAME="284"></A>rest?
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>Either the gods have no power or they have power. If, then, they 
<A NAME="286"></A>have no power, why dost thou pray to them? But if they have power, why 
<A NAME="287"></A>dost thou not pray for them to give thee the faculty of not fearing any 
<A NAME="288"></A>of the things which thou fearest, or of not desiring any of the things 
<A NAME="289"></A>which thou desirest, or not being pained at anything, rather than pray 
<A NAME="290"></A>that any of these things should not happen or happen? for certainly if 
<A NAME="291"></A>they can co-operate with men, they can co-operate for these purposes. But 
<A NAME="292"></A>perhaps thou wilt say, the gods have placed them in thy power. Well, then, 
<A NAME="293"></A>is it not better to use what is in thy power like a free man than to desire 
<A NAME="294"></A>in a slavish and abject way what is not in thy power? And who has told 
<A NAME="295"></A>thee that the gods do not aid us even in the things which are in our power? 
<A NAME="296"></A>Begin, then, to pray for such things, and thou wilt see. One man prays 
<A NAME="297"></A>thus: How shall I be able to lie with that woman? Do thou pray thus: How 
<A NAME="298"></A>shall I not desire to lie with her? Another prays thus: How shall I be 
<A NAME="299"></A>released from this? Another prays: How shall I not desire to be released? 
<A NAME="300"></A>Another thus: How shall I not lose my little son? Thou thus: How shall 
<A NAME="301"></A>I not be afraid to lose him? In fine, turn thy prayers this way, and see 
<A NAME="302"></A>what comes.
<A NAME="303"></A><BR><BR>Epicurus says, In my sickness my conversation was not about my 
<A NAME="304"></A>bodily sufferings, nor, says he, did I talk on such subjects to those who 
<A NAME="305"></A>visited me; but I continued to discourse on the nature of things as before, 
<A NAME="306"></A>keeping to this main point, how the mind, while participating in such movements 
<A NAME="307"></A>as go on in the poor flesh, shall be free from perturbations and maintain 
<A NAME="308"></A>its proper good. Nor did I, he says, give the physicians an opportunity 
<A NAME="309"></A>of putting on solemn looks, as if they were doing something great, but 
<A NAME="310"></A>my life went on well and happily. Do, then, the same that he did both in 
<A NAME="311"></A>sickness, if thou art sick, and in any other circumstances; for never to 
<A NAME="312"></A>desert philosophy in any events that may befall us, nor to hold trifling 
<A NAME="313"></A>talk either with an ignorant man or with one unacquainted with nature, 
<A NAME="314"></A>is a principle of all schools of philosophy; but to be intent only on that 
<A NAME="315"></A>which thou art now doing and on the instrument by which thou doest 
<A NAME="316"></A>it.
<A NAME="317"></A><BR><BR>When thou art offended with any man's shameless conduct, immediately 
<A NAME="318"></A>ask thyself, Is it possible, then, that shameless men should not be in 
<A NAME="319"></A>the world? It is not possible. Do not, then, require what is impossible. 
<A NAME="320"></A>For this man also is one of those shameless men who must of necessity be 
<A NAME="321"></A>in the world. Let the same considerations be present to thy mind in the 
<A NAME="322"></A>case of the knave, and the faithless man, and of every man who does wrong 
<A NAME="323"></A>in any way. For at the same time that thou dost remind thyself that it 
<A NAME="324"></A>is impossible that such kind of men should not exist, thou wilt become 
<A NAME="325"></A>more kindly disposed towards every one individually. It is useful to perceive 
<A NAME="326"></A>this, too, immediately when the occasion arises, what virtue nature has 
<A NAME="327"></A>given to man to oppose to every wrongful act. For she has given to man, 
<A NAME="328"></A>as an antidote against the stupid man, mildness, and against another kind 
<A NAME="329"></A>of man some other power. And in all cases it is possible for thee to correct 
<A NAME="330"></A>by teaching the man who is gone astray; for every man who errs misses his 
<A NAME="331"></A>object and is gone astray. Besides wherein hast thou been injured? For 
<A NAME="332"></A>thou wilt find that no one among those against whom thou art irritated 
<A NAME="333"></A>has done anything by which thy mind could be made worse; but that which 
<A NAME="334"></A>is evil to thee and harmful has its foundation only in the mind. And what 
<A NAME="335"></A>harm is done or what is there strange, if the man who has not been instructed 
<A NAME="336"></A>does the acts of an uninstructed man? Consider whether thou shouldst not 
<A NAME="337"></A>rather blame thyself, because thou didst not expect such a man to err in 
<A NAME="338"></A>such a way. For thou hadst means given thee by thy reason to suppose that 
<A NAME="339"></A>it was likely that he would commit this error, and yet thou hast forgotten 
<A NAME="340"></A>and art amazed that he has erred. But most of all when thou blamest a man 
<A NAME="341"></A>as faithless or ungrateful, turn to thyself. For the fault is manifestly 
<A NAME="342"></A>thy own, whether thou didst trust that a man who had such a disposition 
<A NAME="343"></A>would keep his promise, or when conferring thy kindness thou didst not 
<A NAME="344"></A>confer it absolutely, nor yet in such way as to have received from thy 
<A NAME="345"></A>very act all the profit. For what more dost thou want when thou hast done 
<A NAME="346"></A>a man a service? Art thou not content that thou hast done something conformable 
<A NAME="347"></A>to thy nature, and dost thou seek to be paid for it? Just as if the eye 
<A NAME="348"></A>demanded a recompense for seeing, or the feet for walking. For as these 
<A NAME="349"></A>members are formed for a particular purpose, and by working according to 
<A NAME="350"></A>their several constitutions obtain what is their own; so also as man is 
<A NAME="351"></A>formed by nature to acts of benevolence, when he has done anything benevolent 
<A NAME="352"></A>or in any other way conducive to the common interest, he has acted conformably 
<A NAME="353"></A>to his constitution, and he gets what is his own.
