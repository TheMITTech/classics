<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>The substance of the universe is obedient and compliant; and the reason 
<A NAME="11"></A>which governs it has in itself no cause for doing evil, for it has no malice, 
<A NAME="12"></A>nor does it do evil to anything, nor is anything harmed by it. But all 
<A NAME="13"></A>things are made and perfected according to this reason.
<A NAME="14"></A><BR><BR>Let it make no difference to thee whether thou art cold or warm, 
<A NAME="15"></A>if thou art doing thy duty; and whether thou art drowsy or satisfied with 
<A NAME="16"></A>sleep; and whether ill-spoken of or praised; and whether dying or doing 
<A NAME="17"></A>something else. For it is one of the acts of life, this act by which we 
<A NAME="18"></A>die: it is sufficient then in this act also to do well what we have in 
<A NAME="19"></A>hand.
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><BR>Look within. Let neither the peculiar quality of anything nor its 
<A NAME="21"></A>value escape thee.
<A NAME="22"></A><BR><BR>All existing things soon change, and they will either be reduced 
<A NAME="23"></A>to vapour, if indeed all substance is one, or they will be 
<A NAME="24"></A>dispersed.
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><BR>The reason which governs knows what its own disposition is, and 
<A NAME="26"></A>what it does, and on what material it works.
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR>The best way of avenging thyself is not to become like the wrong 
<A NAME="28"></A>doer.
<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR>Take pleasure in one thing and rest in it, in passing from one 
<A NAME="30"></A>social act to another social act, thinking of God.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR>The ruling principle is that which rouses and turns itself, and 
<A NAME="32"></A>while it makes itself such as it is and such as it wills to be, it also 
<A NAME="33"></A>makes everything which happens appear to itself to be such as it 
<A NAME="34"></A>wills.
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR>In conformity to the nature of the universe every single thing 
<A NAME="36"></A>is accomplished, for certainly it is not in conformity to any other nature 
<A NAME="37"></A>that each thing is accomplished, either a nature which externally comprehends 
<A NAME="38"></A>this, or a nature which is comprehended within this nature, or a nature 
<A NAME="39"></A>external and independent of this.
<A NAME="40"></A><BR><BR>The universe is either a confusion, and a mutual involution of 
<A NAME="41"></A>things, and a dispersion; or it is unity and order and providence. If then 
<A NAME="42"></A>it is the former, why do I desire to tarry in a fortuitous combination 
<A NAME="43"></A>of things and such a disorder? And why do I care about anything else than 
<A NAME="44"></A>how I shall at last become earth? And why am I disturbed, for the dispersion 
<A NAME="45"></A>of my elements will happen whatever I do. But if the other supposition 
<A NAME="46"></A>is true, I venerate, and I am firm, and I trust in him who 
<A NAME="47"></A>governs.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>When thou hast been compelled by circumstances to be disturbed 
<A NAME="49"></A>in a manner, quickly return to thyself and do not continue out of tune 
<A NAME="50"></A>longer than the compulsion lasts; for thou wilt have more mastery over 
<A NAME="51"></A>the harmony by continually recurring to it.
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR>If thou hadst a step-mother and a mother at the same time, thou 
<A NAME="53"></A>wouldst be dutiful to thy step-mother, but still thou wouldst constantly 
<A NAME="54"></A>return to thy mother. Let the court and philosophy now be to thee step-mother 
<A NAME="55"></A>and mother: return to philosophy frequently and repose in her, through 
<A NAME="56"></A>whom what thou meetest with in the court appears to thee tolerable, and 
<A NAME="57"></A>thou appearest tolerable in the court.
<A NAME="58"></A><BR><BR>When we have meat before us and such eatables we receive the impression, 
<A NAME="59"></A>that this is the dead body of a fish, and this is the dead body of a bird 
<A NAME="60"></A>or of a pig; and again, that this Falernian is only a little grape juice, 
<A NAME="61"></A>and this purple robe some sheep's wool dyed with the blood of a shell-fish: 
<A NAME="62"></A>such then are these impressions, and they reach the things themselves and 
<A NAME="63"></A>penetrate them, and so we see what kind of things they are. Just in the 
<A NAME="64"></A>same way ought we to act all through life, and where there are things which 
<A NAME="65"></A>appear most worthy of our approbation, we ought to lay them bare and look 
<A NAME="66"></A>at their worthlessness and strip them of all the words by which they are 
<A NAME="67"></A>exalted. For outward show is a wonderful perverter of the reason, and when 
<A NAME="68"></A>thou art most sure that thou art employed about things worth thy pains, 
<A NAME="69"></A>it is then that it cheats thee most. Consider then what Crates says of 
<A NAME="70"></A>Xenocrates himself.
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>Most of the things which the multitude admire are referred to objects 
<A NAME="72"></A>of the most general kind, those which are held together by cohesion or 
<A NAME="73"></A>natural organization, such as stones, wood, fig-trees, vines, olives. But 
<A NAME="74"></A>those which are admired by men who are a little more reasonable are referred 
<A NAME="75"></A>to the things which are held together by a living principle, as flocks, 
<A NAME="76"></A>herds. Those which are admired by men who are still more instructed are 
<A NAME="77"></A>the things which are held together by a rational soul, not however a universal 
<A NAME="78"></A>soul, but rational so far as it is a soul skilled in some art, or expert 
<A NAME="79"></A>in some other way, or simply rational so far as it possesses a number of 
<A NAME="80"></A>slaves. But he who values rational soul, a soul universal and fitted for 
<A NAME="81"></A>political life, regards nothing else except this; and above all things 
<A NAME="82"></A>he keeps his soul in a condition and in an activity conformable to reason 
<A NAME="83"></A>and social life, and he co-operates to this end with those who are of the 
<A NAME="84"></A>same kind as himself.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>Some things are hurrying into existence, and others are hurrying 
<A NAME="86"></A>out of it; and of that which is coming into existence part is already extinguished. 
<A NAME="87"></A>Motions and changes are continually renewing the world, just as the uninterrupted 
<A NAME="88"></A>course of time is always renewing the infinite duration of ages. In this 
<A NAME="89"></A>flowing stream then, on which there is no abiding, what is there of the 
<A NAME="90"></A>things which hurry by on which a man would set a high price? It would be 
<A NAME="91"></A>just as if a man should fall in love with one of the sparrows which fly 
<A NAME="92"></A>by, but it has already passed out of sight. Something of this kind is the 
<A NAME="93"></A>very life of every man, like the exhalation of the blood and the respiration 
<A NAME="94"></A>of the air. For such as it is to have once drawn in the air and to have 
<A NAME="95"></A>given it back, which we do every moment, just the same is it with the whole 
<A NAME="96"></A>respiratory power, which thou didst receive at thy birth yesterday and 
<A NAME="97"></A>the day before, to give it back to the element from which thou didst first 
<A NAME="98"></A>draw it.
<A NAME="99"></A><BR><BR>Neither is transpiration, as in plants, a thing to be valued, nor 
<A NAME="100"></A>respiration, as in domesticated animals and wild beasts, nor the receiving 
<A NAME="101"></A>of impressions by the appearances of things, nor being moved by desires 
<A NAME="102"></A>as puppets by strings, nor assembling in herds, nor being nourished by 
<A NAME="103"></A>food; for this is just like the act of separating and parting with the 
<A NAME="104"></A>useless part of our food. What then is worth being valued? To be received 
<A NAME="105"></A>with clapping of hands? No. Neither must we value the clapping of tongues, 
<A NAME="106"></A>for the praise which comes from the many is a clapping of tongues. Suppose 
<A NAME="107"></A>then that thou hast given up this worthless thing called fame, what remains 
<A NAME="108"></A>that is worth valuing? This in my opinion, to move thyself and to restrain 
<A NAME="109"></A>thyself in conformity to thy proper constitution, to which end both all 
<A NAME="110"></A>employments and arts lead. For every art aims at this, that the thing which 
<A NAME="111"></A>has been made should be adapted to the work for which it has been made; 
<A NAME="112"></A>and both the vine-planter who looks after the vine, and the horse-breaker, 
<A NAME="113"></A>and he who trains the dog, seek this end. But the education and the teaching 
<A NAME="114"></A>of youth aim at something. In this then is the value of the education and 
<A NAME="115"></A>the teaching. And if this is well, thou wilt not seek anything else. Wilt 
<A NAME="116"></A>thou not cease to value many other things too? Then thou wilt be neither 
<A NAME="117"></A>free, nor sufficient for thy own happiness, nor without passion. For of 
<A NAME="118"></A>necessity thou must be envious, jealous, and suspicious of those who can 
<A NAME="119"></A>take away those things, and plot against those who have that which is valued 
<A NAME="120"></A>by thee. Of necessity a man must be altogether in a state of perturbation 
<A NAME="121"></A>who wants any of these things; and besides, he must often find fault with 
<A NAME="122"></A>the gods. But to reverence and honour thy own mind will make thee content 
<A NAME="123"></A>with thyself, and in harmony with society, and in agreement with the gods, 
<A NAME="124"></A>that is, praising all that they give and have ordered.
<A NAME="125"></A><BR><BR>Above, below, all around are the movements of the elements. But 
<A NAME="126"></A>the motion of virtue is in none of these: it is something more divine, 
<A NAME="127"></A>and advancing by a way hardly observed it goes happily on its 
<A NAME="128"></A>road.
<A NAME="129"></A><BR><BR>How strangely men act. They will not praise those who are living 
<A NAME="130"></A>at the same time and living with themselves; but to be themselves praised 
<A NAME="131"></A>by posterity, by those whom they have never seen or ever will see, this 
<A NAME="132"></A>they set much value on. But this is very much the same as if thou shouldst 
<A NAME="133"></A>be grieved because those who have lived before thee did not praise 
<A NAME="134"></A>thee.
<A NAME="135"></A><BR><BR>If a thing is difficult to be accomplished by thyself, do not think 
<A NAME="136"></A>that it is impossible for man: but if anything is possible for man and 
<A NAME="137"></A>conformable to his nature, think that this can be attained by thyself 
<A NAME="138"></A>too.
<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR>In the gymnastic exercises suppose that a man has torn thee with 
<A NAME="140"></A>his nails, and by dashing against thy head has inflicted a wound. Well, 
<A NAME="141"></A>we neither show any signs of vexation, nor are we offended, nor do we suspect 
<A NAME="142"></A>him afterwards as a treacherous fellow; and yet we are on our guard against 
<A NAME="143"></A>him, not however as an enemy, nor yet with suspicion, but we quietly get 
<A NAME="144"></A>out of his way. Something like this let thy behaviour be in all the other 
<A NAME="145"></A>parts of life; let us overlook many things in those who are like antagonists 
<A NAME="146"></A>in the gymnasium. For it is in our power, as I said, to get out of the 
<A NAME="147"></A>way, and to have no suspicion nor hatred.
<A NAME="148"></A><BR><BR>If any man is able to convince me and show me that I do not think 
<A NAME="149"></A>or act right, I will gladly change; for I seek the truth by which no man 
<A NAME="150"></A>was ever injured. But he is injured who abides in his error and 
<A NAME="151"></A>ignorance.
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR>I do my duty: other things trouble me not; for they are either 
<A NAME="153"></A>things without life, or things without reason, or things that have rambled 
<A NAME="154"></A>and know not the way.
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR>As to the animals which have no reason and generally all things 
<A NAME="156"></A>and objects, do thou, since thou hast reason and they have none, make use 
<A NAME="157"></A>of them with a generous and liberal spirit. But towards human beings, as 
<A NAME="158"></A>they have reason, behave in a social spirit. And on all occasions call 
<A NAME="159"></A>on the gods, and do not perplex thyself about the length of time in which 
<A NAME="160"></A>thou shalt do this; for even three hours so spent are 
<A NAME="161"></A>sufficient.
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR>Alexander the Macedonian and his groom by death were brought to 
<A NAME="163"></A>the same state; for either they were received among the same seminal principles 
<A NAME="164"></A>of the universe, or they were alike dispersed among the 
<A NAME="165"></A>atoms.
<A NAME="166"></A><BR><BR>Consider how many things in the same indivisible time take place 
<A NAME="167"></A>in each of us, things which concern the body and things which concern the 
<A NAME="168"></A>soul: and so thou wilt not wonder if many more things, or rather all things 
<A NAME="169"></A>which come into existence in that which is the one and all, which we call 
<A NAME="170"></A>Cosmos, exist in it at the same time.
<A NAME="171"></A><BR><BR>If any man should propose to thee the question, how the name Antoninus 
<A NAME="172"></A>is written, wouldst thou with a straining of the voice utter each letter? 
<A NAME="173"></A>What then if they grow angry, wilt thou be angry too? Wilt thou not go 
<A NAME="174"></A>on with composure and number every letter? just so then in this life also 
<A NAME="175"></A>remember that every duty is made up of certain parts. These it is thy duty 
<A NAME="176"></A>to observe and without being disturbed or showing anger towards those who 
<A NAME="177"></A>are angry with thee to go on thy way and finish that which is set before 
<A NAME="178"></A>thee.
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR>How cruel it is not to allow men to strive after the things which 
<A NAME="180"></A>appear to them to be suitable to their nature and profitable! And yet in 
<A NAME="181"></A>a manner thou dost not allow them to do this, when thou art vexed because 
<A NAME="182"></A>they do wrong. For they are certainly moved towards things because they 
<A NAME="183"></A>suppose them to be suitable to their nature and profitable to them.- But 
<A NAME="184"></A>it is not so.- Teach them then, and show them without being 
<A NAME="185"></A>angry.
<A NAME="186"></A><BR><BR>Death is a cessation of the impressions through the senses, and 
<A NAME="187"></A>of the pulling of the strings which move the appetites, and of the discursive 
<A NAME="188"></A>movements of the thoughts, and of the service to the 
<A NAME="189"></A>flesh.
<A NAME="190"></A><BR><BR>It is a shame for the soul to be first to give way in this life, 
<A NAME="191"></A>when thy body does not give way.
<A NAME="192"></A><BR><BR>Take care that thou art not made into a Caesar, that thou art not 
<A NAME="193"></A>dyed with this dye; for such things happen. Keep thyself then simple, good, 
<A NAME="194"></A>pure, serious, free from affectation, a friend of justice, a worshipper 
<A NAME="195"></A>of the gods, kind, affectionate, strenuous in all proper acts. Strive to 
<A NAME="196"></A>continue to be such as philosophy wished to make thee. Reverence the gods, 
<A NAME="197"></A>and help men. Short is life. There is only one fruit of this terrene life, 
<A NAME="198"></A>a pious disposition and social acts. Do everything as a disciple of Antoninus. 
<A NAME="199"></A>Remember his constancy in every act which was conformable to reason, and 
<A NAME="200"></A>his evenness in all things, and his piety, and the serenity of his countenance, 
<A NAME="201"></A>and his sweetness, and his disregard of empty fame, and his efforts to 
<A NAME="202"></A>understand things; and how he would never let anything pass without having 
<A NAME="203"></A>first most carefully examined it and clearly understood it; and how he 
<A NAME="204"></A>bore with those who blamed him unjustly without blaming them in return; 
<A NAME="205"></A>how he did nothing in a hurry; and how he listened not to calumnies, and 
<A NAME="206"></A>how exact an examiner of manners and actions he was; and not given to reproach 
<A NAME="207"></A>people, nor timid, nor suspicious, nor a sophist; and with how little he 
<A NAME="208"></A>was satisfied, such as lodging, bed, dress, food, servants; and how laborious 
<A NAME="209"></A>and patient; and how he was able on account of his sparing diet to hold 
<A NAME="210"></A>out to the evening, not even requiring to relieve himself by any evacuations 
<A NAME="211"></A>except at the usual hour; and his firmness and uniformity in his friendships; 
<A NAME="212"></A>and how he tolerated freedom of speech in those who opposed his opinions; 
<A NAME="213"></A>and the pleasure that he had when any man showed him anything better; and 
<A NAME="214"></A>how religious he was without superstition. Imitate all this that thou mayest 
<A NAME="215"></A>have as good a conscience, when thy last hour comes, as he 
<A NAME="216"></A>had.
<A NAME="217"></A><BR><BR>Return to thy sober senses and call thyself back; and when thou 
<A NAME="218"></A>hast roused thyself from sleep and hast perceived that they were only dreams 
<A NAME="219"></A>which troubled thee, now in thy waking hours look at these (the things 
<A NAME="220"></A>about thee) as thou didst look at those (the dreams).
<A NAME="221"></A><BR><BR>I consist of a little body and a soul. Now to this little body 
<A NAME="222"></A>all things are indifferent, for it is not able to perceive differences. 
<A NAME="223"></A>But to the understanding those things only are indifferent, which are not 
<A NAME="224"></A>the works of its own activity. But whatever things are the works of its 
<A NAME="225"></A>own activity, all these are in its power. And of these however only those 
<A NAME="226"></A>which are done with reference to the present; for as to the future and 
<A NAME="227"></A>the past activities of the mind, even these are for the present 
<A NAME="228"></A>indifferent.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR><BR>Neither the labour which the hand does nor that of the foot is 
<A NAME="230"></A>contrary to nature, so long as the foot does the foot's work and the hand 
<A NAME="231"></A>the hand's. So then neither to a man as a man is his labour contrary to 
<A NAME="232"></A>nature, so long as it does the things of a man. But if the labour is not 
<A NAME="233"></A>contrary to his nature, neither is it an evil to him.
<A NAME="234"></A><BR><BR>How many pleasures have been enjoyed by robbers, patricides, 
<A NAME="235"></A>tyrants.
<A NAME="236"></A><BR><BR>Dost thou not see how the handicraftsmen accommodate themselves 
<A NAME="237"></A>up to a certain point to those who are not skilled in their craft- nevertheless 
<A NAME="238"></A>they cling to the reason (the principles) of their art and do not endure 
<A NAME="239"></A>to depart from it? Is it not strange if the architect and the physician 
<A NAME="240"></A>shall have more respect to the reason (the principles) of their own arts 
<A NAME="241"></A>than man to his own reason, which is common to him and the 
<A NAME="242"></A>gods?
<A NAME="243"></A><BR><BR>Asia, Europe are corners of the universe: all the sea a drop in 
<A NAME="244"></A>the universe; Athos a little clod of the universe: all the present time 
<A NAME="245"></A>is a point in eternity. All things are little, changeable, perishable. 
<A NAME="246"></A>All things come from thence, from that universal ruling power either directly 
<A NAME="247"></A>proceeding or by way of sequence. And accordingly the lion's gaping jaws, 
<A NAME="248"></A>and that which is poisonous, and every harmful thing, as a thorn, as mud, 
<A NAME="249"></A>are after-products of the grand and beautiful. Do not then imagine that 
<A NAME="250"></A>they are of another kind from that which thou dost venerate, but form a 
<A NAME="251"></A>just opinion of the source of all.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR>He who has seen present things has seen all, both everything which 
<A NAME="253"></A>has taken place from all eternity and everything which will be for time 
<A NAME="254"></A>without end; for all things are of one kin and of one 
<A NAME="255"></A>form.
<A NAME="256"></A><BR><BR>Frequently consider the connexion of all things in the universe 
<A NAME="257"></A>and their relation to one another. For in a manner all things are implicated 
<A NAME="258"></A>with one another, and all in this way are friendly to one another; for 
<A NAME="259"></A>one thing comes in order after another, and this is by virtue of the active 
<A NAME="260"></A>movement and mutual conspiration and the unity of the 
<A NAME="261"></A>substance.
<A NAME="262"></A><BR><BR>Adapt thyself to the things with which thy lot has been cast: and 
<A NAME="263"></A>the men among whom thou hast received thy portion, love them, but do it 
<A NAME="264"></A>truly, sincerely.
<A NAME="265"></A><BR><BR>Every instrument, tool, vessel, if it does that for which it has 
<A NAME="266"></A>been made, is well, and yet he who made it is not there. But in the things 
<A NAME="267"></A>which are held together by nature there is within and there abides in them 
<A NAME="268"></A>the power which made them; wherefore the more is it fit to reverence this 
<A NAME="269"></A>power, and to think, that, if thou dost live and act according to its will, 
<A NAME="270"></A>everything in thee is in conformity to intelligence. And thus also in the 
<A NAME="271"></A>universe the things which belong to it are in conformity to 
<A NAME="272"></A>intelligence.
<A NAME="273"></A><BR><BR>Whatever of the things which are not within thy power thou shalt 
<A NAME="274"></A>suppose to be good for thee or evil, it must of necessity be that, if such 
<A NAME="275"></A>a bad thing befall thee or the loss of such a good thing, thou wilt blame 
<A NAME="276"></A>the gods, and hate men too, those who are the cause of the misfortune or 
<A NAME="277"></A>the loss, or those who are suspected of being likely to be the cause; and 
<A NAME="278"></A>indeed we do much injustice, because we make a difference between these 
<A NAME="279"></A>things. But if we judge only those things which are in our power to be 
<A NAME="280"></A>good or bad, there remains no reason either for finding fault with God 
<A NAME="281"></A>or standing in a hostile attitude to man.
<A NAME="282"></A><BR><BR>We are all working together to one end, some with knowledge and 
<A NAME="283"></A>design, and others without knowing what they do; as men also when they 
<A NAME="284"></A>are asleep, of whom it is Heraclitus, I think, who says that they are labourers 
<A NAME="285"></A>and co-operators in the things which take place in the universe. But men 
<A NAME="286"></A>co-operate after different fashions: and even those co-operate abundantly, 
<A NAME="287"></A>who find fault with what happens and those who try to oppose it and to 
<A NAME="288"></A>hinder it; for the universe had need even of such men as these. It remains 
<A NAME="289"></A>then for thee to understand among what kind of workmen thou placest thyself; 
<A NAME="290"></A>for he who rules all things will certainly make a right use of thee, and 
<A NAME="291"></A>he will receive thee among some part of the co-operators and of those whose 
<A NAME="292"></A>labours conduce to one end. But be not thou such a part as the mean and 
<A NAME="293"></A>ridiculous verse in the play, which Chrysippus speaks 
<A NAME="294"></A>of.
<A NAME="295"></A><BR><BR>Does the sun undertake to do the work of the rain, or Aesculapius 
<A NAME="296"></A>the work of the Fruit-bearer (the earth)? And how is it with respect to 
<A NAME="297"></A>each of the stars, are they not different and yet they work together to 
<A NAME="298"></A>the same end?
<A NAME="299"></A><BR><BR>If the gods have determined about me and about the things which 
<A NAME="300"></A>must happen to me, they have determined well, for it is not easy even to 
<A NAME="301"></A>imagine a deity without forethought; and as to doing me harm, why should 
<A NAME="302"></A>they have any desire towards that? For what advantage would result to them 
<A NAME="303"></A>from this or to the whole, which is the special object of their providence? 
<A NAME="304"></A>But if they have not determined about me individually, they have certainly 
<A NAME="305"></A>determined about the whole at least, and the things which happen by way 
<A NAME="306"></A>of sequence in this general arrangement I ought to accept with pleasure 
<A NAME="307"></A>and to be content with them. But if they determine about nothing- which 
<A NAME="308"></A>it is wicked to believe, or if we do believe it, let us neither sacrifice 
<A NAME="309"></A>nor pray nor swear by them nor do anything else which we do as if the gods 
<A NAME="310"></A>were present and lived with us- but if however the gods determine about 
<A NAME="311"></A>none of the things which concern us, I am able to determine about myself, 
<A NAME="312"></A>and I can inquire about that which is useful; and that is useful to every 
<A NAME="313"></A>man which is conformable to his own constitution and nature. But my nature 
<A NAME="314"></A>is rational and social; and my city and country, so far as I am Antoninus, 
<A NAME="315"></A>is Rome, but so far as I am a man, it is the world. The things then which 
<A NAME="316"></A>are useful to these cities are alone useful to me. Whatever happens to 
<A NAME="317"></A>every man, this is for the interest of the universal: this might be sufficient. 
<A NAME="318"></A>But further thou wilt observe this also as a general truth, if thou dost 
<A NAME="319"></A>observe, that whatever is profitable to any man is profitable also to other 
<A NAME="320"></A>men. But let the word profitable be taken here in the common sense as said 
<A NAME="321"></A>of things of the middle kind, neither good nor bad.
<A NAME="322"></A><BR><BR>As it happens to thee in the amphitheatre and such places, that 
<A NAME="323"></A>the continual sight of the same things and the uniformity make the spectacle 
<A NAME="324"></A>wearisome, so it is in the whole of life; for all things above, below, 
<A NAME="325"></A>are the same and from the same. How long then?
<A NAME="326"></A><BR><BR>Think continually that all kinds of men and of all kinds of pursuits 
<A NAME="327"></A>and of all nations are dead, so that thy thoughts come down even to Philistion 
<A NAME="328"></A>and Phoebus and Origanion. Now turn thy thoughts to the other kinds of 
<A NAME="329"></A>men. To that place then we must remove, where there are so many great orators, 
<A NAME="330"></A>and so many noble philosophers, Heraclitus, Pythagoras, Socrates; so many 
<A NAME="331"></A>heroes of former days, and so many generals after them, and tyrants; besides 
<A NAME="332"></A>these, Eudoxus, Hipparchus, Archimedes, and other men of acute natural 
<A NAME="333"></A>talents, great minds, lovers of labour, versatile, confident, mockers even 
<A NAME="334"></A>of the perishable and ephemeral life of man, as Menippus and such as are 
<A NAME="335"></A>like him. As to all these consider that they have long been in the dust. 
<A NAME="336"></A>What harm then is this to them; and what to those whose names are altogether 
<A NAME="337"></A>unknown? One thing here is worth a great deal, to pass thy life in truth 
<A NAME="338"></A>and justice, with a benevolent disposition even to liars and unjust 
<A NAME="339"></A>men.
<A NAME="340"></A><BR><BR>When thou wishest to delight thyself, think of the virtues of those 
<A NAME="341"></A>who live with thee; for instance, the activity of one, and the modesty 
<A NAME="342"></A>of another, and the liberality of a third, and some other good quality 
<A NAME="343"></A>of a fourth. For nothing delights so much as the examples of the virtues, 
<A NAME="344"></A>when they are exhibited in the morals of those who live with us and present 
<A NAME="345"></A>themselves in abundance, as far as is possible. Wherefore we must keep 
<A NAME="346"></A>them before us.
<A NAME="347"></A><BR><BR>Thou art not dissatisfied, I suppose, because thou weighest only 
<A NAME="348"></A>so many litrae and not three hundred. Be not dissatisfied then that thou 
<A NAME="349"></A>must live only so many years and not more; for as thou art satisfied with 
<A NAME="350"></A>the amount of substance which has been assigned to thee, so be content 
<A NAME="351"></A>with the time.
<A NAME="352"></A><BR><BR>Let us try to persuade them (men). But act even against their will, 
<A NAME="353"></A>when the principles of justice lead that way. If however any man by using 
<A NAME="354"></A>force stands in thy way, betake thyself to contentment and tranquility, 
<A NAME="355"></A>and at the same time employ the hindrance towards the exercise of some 
<A NAME="356"></A>other virtue; and remember that thy attempt was with a reservation, that 
<A NAME="357"></A>thou didst not desire to do impossibilities. What then didst thou desire?- 
<A NAME="358"></A>Some such effort as this.- But thou attainest thy object, if the things 
<A NAME="359"></A>to which thou wast moved are accomplished.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR>He who loves fame considers another man's activity to be his own 
<A NAME="361"></A>good; and he who loves pleasure, his own sensations; but he who has understanding, 
<A NAME="362"></A>considers his own acts to be his own good.
<A NAME="363"></A><BR><BR>It is in our power to have no opinion about a thing, and not to 
<A NAME="364"></A>be disturbed in our soul; for things themselves have no natural power to 
<A NAME="365"></A>form our judgements.
<A NAME="366"></A><BR><BR>Accustom thyself to attend carefully to what is said by another, 
<A NAME="367"></A>and as much as it is possible, be in the speaker's mind.
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR>That which is not good for the swarm, neither is it good for the 
<A NAME="369"></A>bee.
<A NAME="370"></A><BR><BR>If sailors abused the helmsman or the sick the doctor, would they 
<A NAME="371"></A>listen to anybody else; or how could the helmsman secure the safety of 
<A NAME="372"></A>those in the ship or the doctor the health of those whom he 
<A NAME="373"></A>attends?
<A NAME="374"></A><BR><BR>How many together with whom I came into the world are already gone 
<A NAME="375"></A>out of it.
<A NAME="376"></A><BR><BR>To the jaundiced honey tastes bitter, and to those bitten by mad 
<A NAME="377"></A>dogs water causes fear; and to little children the ball is a fine thing. 
<A NAME="378"></A>Why then am I angry? Dost thou think that a false opinion has less power 
<A NAME="379"></A>than the bile in the jaundiced or the poison in him who is bitten by a 
<A NAME="380"></A>mad dog?
<A NAME="381"></A><BR><BR>No man will hinder thee from living according to the reason of 
<A NAME="382"></A>thy own nature: nothing will happen to thee contrary to the reason of the 
<A NAME="383"></A>universal nature.
<A NAME="384"></A><BR><BR>What kind of people are those whom men wish to please, and for 
<A NAME="385"></A>what objects, and by what kind of acts? How soon will time cover all things, 
<A NAME="386"></A>and how many it has covered already.
