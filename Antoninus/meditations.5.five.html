<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>In he morning when thou risest unwillingly, let this thought be present- 
<A NAME="11"></A>I am rising to the work of a human being. Why then am I dissatisfied if 
<A NAME="12"></A>I am going to do the things for which I exist and for which I was brought 
<A NAME="13"></A>into the world? Or have I been made for this, to lie in the bed-clothes 
<A NAME="14"></A>and keep myself warm?- But this is more pleasant.- Dost thou exist then 
<A NAME="15"></A>to take thy pleasure, and not at all for action or exertion? Dost thou 
<A NAME="16"></A>not see the little plants, the little birds, the ants, the spiders, the 
<A NAME="17"></A>bees working together to put in order their several parts of the universe? 
<A NAME="18"></A>And art thou unwilling to do the work of a human being, and dost thou not 
<A NAME="19"></A>make haste to do that which is according to thy nature?- But it is necessary 
<A NAME="20"></A>to take rest also.- It is necessary: however nature has fixed bounds to 
<A NAME="21"></A>this too: she has fixed bounds both to eating and drinking, and yet thou 
<A NAME="22"></A>goest beyond these bounds, beyond what is sufficient; yet in thy acts it 
<A NAME="23"></A>is not so, but thou stoppest short of what thou canst do. So thou lovest 
<A NAME="24"></A>not thyself, for if thou didst, thou wouldst love thy nature and her will. 
<A NAME="25"></A>But those who love their several arts exhaust themselves in working at 
<A NAME="26"></A>them unwashed and without food; but thou valuest thy own own nature less 
<A NAME="27"></A>than the turner values the turning art, or the dancer the dancing art, 
<A NAME="28"></A>or the lover of money values his money, or the vainglorious man his little 
<A NAME="29"></A>glory. And such men, when they have a violent affection to a thing, choose 
<A NAME="30"></A>neither to eat nor to sleep rather than to perfect the things which they 
<A NAME="31"></A>care for. But are the acts which concern society more vile in thy eyes 
<A NAME="32"></A>and less worthy of thy labour?
<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR>How easy it is to repel and to wipe away every impression which 
<A NAME="34"></A>is troublesome or unsuitable, and immediately to be in all 
<A NAME="35"></A>tranquility.
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR>Judge every word and deed which are according to nature to be fit 
<A NAME="37"></A>for thee; and be not diverted by the blame which follows from any people 
<A NAME="38"></A>nor by their words, but if a thing is good to be done or said, do not consider 
<A NAME="39"></A>it unworthy of thee. For those persons have their peculiar leading principle 
<A NAME="40"></A>and follow their peculiar movement; which things do not thou regard, but 
<A NAME="41"></A>go straight on, following thy own nature and the common nature; and the 
<A NAME="42"></A>way of both is one.
<A NAME="43"></A><BR><BR>I go through the things which happen according to nature until 
<A NAME="44"></A>I shall fall and rest, breathing out my breath into that element out of 
<A NAME="45"></A>which I daily draw it in, and falling upon that earth out of which my father 
<A NAME="46"></A>collected the seed, and my mother the blood, and my nurse the milk; out 
<A NAME="47"></A>of which during so many years I have been supplied with food and drink; 
<A NAME="48"></A>which bears me when I tread on it and abuse it for so many 
<A NAME="49"></A>purposes.
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR>Thou sayest, Men cannot admire the sharpness of thy wits.- Be it 
<A NAME="51"></A>so: but there are many other things of which thou canst not say, I am not 
<A NAME="52"></A>formed for them by nature. Show those qualities then which are altogether 
<A NAME="53"></A>in thy power, sincerity, gravity, endurance of labour, aversion to pleasure, 
<A NAME="54"></A>contentment with thy portion and with few things, benevolence, frankness, 
<A NAME="55"></A>no love of superfluity, freedom from trifling magnanimity. Dost thou not 
<A NAME="56"></A>see how many qualities thou art immediately able to exhibit, in which there 
<A NAME="57"></A>is no excuse of natural incapacity and unfitness, and yet thou still remainest 
<A NAME="58"></A>voluntarily below the mark? Or art thou compelled through being defectively 
<A NAME="59"></A>furnished by nature to murmur, and to be stingy, and to flatter, and to 
<A NAME="60"></A>find fault with thy poor body, and to try to please men, and to make great 
<A NAME="61"></A>display, and to be so restless in thy mind? No, by the gods: but thou mightest 
<A NAME="62"></A>have been delivered from these things long ago. Only if in truth thou canst 
<A NAME="63"></A>be charged with being rather slow and dull of comprehension, thou must 
<A NAME="64"></A>exert thyself about this also, not neglecting it nor yet taking pleasure 
<A NAME="65"></A>in thy dulness.
<A NAME="66"></A><BR><BR>One man, when he has done a service to another, is ready to set 
<A NAME="67"></A>it down to his account as a favour conferred. Another is not ready to do 
<A NAME="68"></A>this, but still in his own mind he thinks of the man as his debtor, and 
<A NAME="69"></A>he knows what he has done. A third in a manner does not even know what 
<A NAME="70"></A>he has done, but he is like a vine which has produced grapes, and seeks 
<A NAME="71"></A>for nothing more after it has once produced its proper fruit. As a horse 
<A NAME="72"></A>when he has run, a dog when he has tracked the game, a bee when it has 
<A NAME="73"></A>made the honey, so a man when he has done a good act, does not call out 
<A NAME="74"></A>for others to come and see, but he goes on to another act, as a vine goes 
<A NAME="75"></A>on to produce again the grapes in season.- Must a man then be one of these, 
<A NAME="76"></A>who in a manner act thus without observing it?- Yes.- But this very thing 
<A NAME="77"></A>is necessary, the observation of what a man is doing: for, it may be said, 
<A NAME="78"></A>it is characteristic of the social animal to perceive that he is working 
<A NAME="79"></A>in a social manner, and indeed to wish that his social partner also should 
<A NAME="80"></A>perceive it.- It is true what thou sayest, but thou dost not rightly understand 
<A NAME="81"></A>what is now said: and for this reason thou wilt become one of those of 
<A NAME="82"></A>whom I spoke before, for even they are misled by a certain show of reason. 
<A NAME="83"></A>But if thou wilt choose to understand the meaning of what is said, do not 
<A NAME="84"></A>fear that for this reason thou wilt omit any social 
<A NAME="85"></A>act.
<A NAME="86"></A><BR><BR>A prayer of the Athenians: Rain, rain, O dear Zeus, down on the 
<A NAME="87"></A>ploughed fields of the Athenians and on the plains.- In truth we ought 
<A NAME="88"></A>not to pray at all, or we ought to pray in this simple and noble 
<A NAME="89"></A>fashion.
<A NAME="90"></A><BR><BR>Just as we must understand when it is said, That Aesculapius prescribed 
<A NAME="91"></A>to this man horse-exercise, or bathing in cold water or going without shoes; 
<A NAME="92"></A>so we must understand it when it is said, That the nature of the universe 
<A NAME="93"></A>prescribed to this man disease or mutilation or loss or anything else of 
<A NAME="94"></A>the kind. For in the first case Prescribed means something like this: he 
<A NAME="95"></A>prescribed this for this man as a thing adapted to procure health; and 
<A NAME="96"></A>in the second case it means: That which happens to (or, suits) every man 
<A NAME="97"></A>is fixed in a manner for him suitably to his destiny. For this is what 
<A NAME="98"></A>we mean when we say that things are suitable to us, as the workmen say 
<A NAME="99"></A>of squared stones in walls or the pyramids, that they are suitable, when 
<A NAME="100"></A>they fit them to one another in some kind of connexion. For there is altogether 
<A NAME="101"></A>one fitness, harmony. And as the universe is made up out of all bodies 
<A NAME="102"></A>to be such a body as it is, so out of all existing causes necessity (destiny) 
<A NAME="103"></A>is made up to be such a cause as it is. And even those who are completely 
<A NAME="104"></A>ignorant understand what I mean, for they say, It (necessity, destiny) 
<A NAME="105"></A>brought this to such a person.- This then was brought and this was precribed 
<A NAME="106"></A>to him. Let us then receive these things, as well as those which Aesculapius 
<A NAME="107"></A>prescribes. Many as a matter of course even among his prescriptions are 
<A NAME="108"></A>disagreeable, but we accept them in the hope of health. Let the perfecting 
<A NAME="109"></A>and accomplishment of the things, which the common nature judges to be 
<A NAME="110"></A>good, be judged by thee to be of the same kind as thy health. And so accept 
<A NAME="111"></A>everything which happens, even if it seem disagreeable, because it leads 
<A NAME="112"></A>to this, to the health of the universe and to the prosperity and felicity 
<A NAME="113"></A>of Zeus (the universe). For he would not have brought on any man what he 
<A NAME="114"></A>has brought, if it were not useful for the whole. Neither does the nature 
<A NAME="115"></A>of anything, whatever it may be, cause anything which is not suitable to 
<A NAME="116"></A>that which is directed by it. For two reasons then it is right to be content 
<A NAME="117"></A>with that which happens to thee; the one, because it was done for thee 
<A NAME="118"></A>and prescribed for thee, and in a manner had reference to thee, originally 
<A NAME="119"></A>from the most ancient causes spun with thy destiny; and the other, because 
<A NAME="120"></A>even that which comes severally to every man is to the power which administers 
<A NAME="121"></A>the universe a cause of felicity and perfection, nay even of its very continuance. 
<A NAME="122"></A>For the integrity of the whole is mutilated, if thou cuttest off anything 
<A NAME="123"></A>whatever from the conjunction and the continuity either of the parts or 
<A NAME="124"></A>of the causes. And thou dost cut off, as far as it is in thy power, when 
<A NAME="125"></A>thou art dissatisfied, and in a manner triest to put anything out of the 
<A NAME="126"></A>way.
<A NAME="127"></A><BR><BR>Be not disgusted, nor discouraged, nor dissatisfied, if thou dost 
<A NAME="128"></A>not succeed in doing everything according to right principles; but when 
<A NAME="129"></A>thou bast failed, return back again, and be content if the greater part 
<A NAME="130"></A>of what thou doest is consistent with man's nature, and love this to which 
<A NAME="131"></A>thou returnest; and do not return to philosophy as if she were a master, 
<A NAME="132"></A>but act like those who have sore eyes and apply a bit of sponge and egg, 
<A NAME="133"></A>or as another applies a plaster, or drenching with water. For thus thou 
<A NAME="134"></A>wilt not fail to obey reason, and thou wilt repose in it. And remember 
<A NAME="135"></A>that philosophy requires only the things which thy nature requires; but 
<A NAME="136"></A>thou wouldst have something else which is not according to nature.- It 
<A NAME="137"></A>may be objected, Why what is more agreeable than this which I am doing?- 
<A NAME="138"></A>But is not this the very reason why pleasure deceives us? And consider 
<A NAME="139"></A>if magnanimity, freedom, simplicity, equanimity, piety, are not more agreeable. 
<A NAME="140"></A>For what is more agreeable than wisdom itself, when thou thinkest of the 
<A NAME="141"></A>security and the happy course of all things which depend on the faculty 
<A NAME="142"></A>of understanding and knowledge?
<A NAME="143"></A><BR><BR>Things are in such a kind of envelopment that they have seemed 
<A NAME="144"></A>to philosophers, not a few nor those common philosophers, altogether unintelligible; 
<A NAME="145"></A>nay even to the Stoics themselves they seem difficult to understand. And 
<A NAME="146"></A>all our assent is changeable; for where is the man who never changes? Carry 
<A NAME="147"></A>thy thoughts then to the objects themselves, and consider how short-lived 
<A NAME="148"></A>they are and worthless, and that they may be in the possession of a filthy 
<A NAME="149"></A>wretch or a whore or a robber. Then turn to the morals of those who live 
<A NAME="150"></A>with thee, and it is hardly possible to endure even the most agreeable 
<A NAME="151"></A>of them, to say nothing of a man being hardly able to endure himself. In 
<A NAME="152"></A>such darkness then and dirt and in so constant a flux both of substance 
<A NAME="153"></A>and of time, and of motion and of things moved, what there is worth being 
<A NAME="154"></A>highly prized or even an object of serious pursuit, I cannot imagine. But 
<A NAME="155"></A>on the contrary it is a man's duty to comfort himself, and to wait for 
<A NAME="156"></A>the
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR>natural dissolution and not to be vexed at the delay, but to rest 
<A NAME="158"></A>in these principles only: the one, that nothing will happen to me which 
<A NAME="159"></A>is not conformable to the nature of the universe; and the other, that it 
<A NAME="160"></A>is in my power never to act contrary to my god and daemon: for there is 
<A NAME="161"></A>no man who will compel me to this.
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR>About what am I now employing my own soul? On every occasion I 
<A NAME="163"></A>must ask myself this question, and inquire, what have I now in this part 
<A NAME="164"></A>of me which they call the ruling principle? And whose soul have I now? 
<A NAME="165"></A>That of a child, or of a young man, or of a feeble woman, or of a tyrant, 
<A NAME="166"></A>or of a domestic animal, or of a wild beast?
<A NAME="167"></A><BR><BR>What kind of things those are which appear good to the many, we 
<A NAME="168"></A>may learn even from this. For if any man should conceive certain things 
<A NAME="169"></A>as being really good, such as prudence, temperance, justice, fortitude, 
<A NAME="170"></A>he would not after having first conceived these endure to listen to anything 
<A NAME="171"></A>which should not be in harmony with what is really good. But if a man has 
<A NAME="172"></A>first conceived as good the things which appear to the many to be good, 
<A NAME="173"></A>he will listen and readily receive as very applicable that which was said 
<A NAME="174"></A>by the comic writer. Thus even the many perceive the difference. For were 
<A NAME="175"></A>it not so, this saying would not offend and would not be rejected in the 
<A NAME="176"></A>first case, while we receive it when it is said of wealth, and of the means 
<A NAME="177"></A>which further luxury and fame, as said fitly and wittily. Go on then and 
<A NAME="178"></A>ask if we should value and think those things to be good, to which after 
<A NAME="179"></A>their first conception in the mind the words of the comic writer might 
<A NAME="180"></A>be aptly applied- that he who has them, through pure abundance has not 
<A NAME="181"></A>a place to ease himself in.
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>I am composed of the formal and the material; and neither of them 
<A NAME="183"></A>will perish into non-existence, as neither of them came into existence 
<A NAME="184"></A>out of non-existence. Every part of me then will be reduced by change into 
<A NAME="185"></A>some part of the universe, and that again will change into another part 
<A NAME="186"></A>of the universe, and so on for ever. And by consequence of such a change 
<A NAME="187"></A>I too exist, and those who begot me, and so on for ever in the other direction. 
<A NAME="188"></A>For nothing hinders us from saying so, even if the universe is administered 
<A NAME="189"></A>according to definite periods of revolution.
<A NAME="190"></A><BR><BR>Reason and the reasoning art (philosophy) are powers which are 
<A NAME="191"></A>sufficient for themselves and for their own works. They move then from 
<A NAME="192"></A>a first principle which is their own, and they make their way to the end 
<A NAME="193"></A>which is proposed to them; and this is the reason why such acts are named 
<A NAME="194"></A>catorthoseis or right acts, which word signifies that they proceed by the 
<A NAME="195"></A>right road.
<A NAME="196"></A><BR><BR>None of these things ought to be called a man's, which do not belong 
<A NAME="197"></A>to a man, as man. They are not required of a man, nor does man's nature 
<A NAME="198"></A>promise them, nor are they the means of man's nature attaining its end. 
<A NAME="199"></A>Neither then does the end of man lie in these things, nor yet that which 
<A NAME="200"></A>aids to the accomplishment of this end, and that which aids towards this 
<A NAME="201"></A>end is that which is good. Besides, if any of these things did belong to 
<A NAME="202"></A>man, it would not be right for a man to despise them and to set himself 
<A NAME="203"></A>against them; nor would a man be worthy of praise who showed that he did 
<A NAME="204"></A>not want these things, nor would he who stinted himself in any of them 
<A NAME="205"></A>be good, if indeed these things were good. But now the more of these things 
<A NAME="206"></A>a man deprives himself of, or of other things like them, or even when he 
<A NAME="207"></A>is deprived of any of them, the more patiently he endures the loss, just 
<A NAME="208"></A>in the same degree he is a better man.
<A NAME="209"></A><BR><BR>Such as are thy habitual thoughts, such also will be the character 
<A NAME="210"></A>of thy mind; for the soul is dyed by the thoughts. Dye it then with a continuous 
<A NAME="211"></A>series of such thoughts as these: for instance, that where a man can live, 
<A NAME="212"></A>there he can also live well. But he must live in a palace;- well then, 
<A NAME="213"></A>he can also live well in a palace. And again, consider that for whatever 
<A NAME="214"></A>purpose each thing has been constituted, for this it has been constituted, 
<A NAME="215"></A>and towards this it is carried; and its end is in that towards which it 
<A NAME="216"></A>is carried; and where the end is, there also is the advantage and the good 
<A NAME="217"></A>of each thing. Now the good for the reasonable animal is society; for that 
<A NAME="218"></A>we are made for society has been shown above. Is it not plain that the 
<A NAME="219"></A>inferior exist for the sake of the superior? But the things which have 
<A NAME="220"></A>life are superior to those which have not life, and of those which have 
<A NAME="221"></A>life the superior are those which have reason.
<A NAME="222"></A><BR><BR>To seek what is impossible is madness: and it is impossible that 
<A NAME="223"></A>the bad should not do something of this kind.
<A NAME="224"></A><BR><BR>Nothing happens to any man which he is not formed by nature to 
<A NAME="225"></A>bear. The same things happen to another, and either because he does not 
<A NAME="226"></A>see that they have happened or because he would show a great spirit he 
<A NAME="227"></A>is firm and remains unharmed. It is a shame then that ignorance and conceit 
<A NAME="228"></A>should be stronger than wisdom.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR><BR>Things themselves touch not the soul, not in the least degree; 
<A NAME="230"></A>nor have they admission to the soul, nor can they turn or move the soul: 
<A NAME="231"></A>but the soul turns and moves itself alone, and whatever judgements it may 
<A NAME="232"></A>think proper to make, such it makes for itself the things which present 
<A NAME="233"></A>themselves to it.
<A NAME="234"></A><BR><BR>In one respect man is the nearest thing to me, so far as I must 
<A NAME="235"></A>do good to men and endure them. But so far as some men make themselves 
<A NAME="236"></A>obstacles to my proper acts, man becomes to me one of the things which 
<A NAME="237"></A>are indifferent, no less than the sun or wind or a wild beast. Now it is 
<A NAME="238"></A>true that these may impede my action, but they are no impediments to my 
<A NAME="239"></A>affects and disposition, which have the power of acting conditionally and 
<A NAME="240"></A>changing: for the mind converts and changes every hindrance to its activity 
<A NAME="241"></A>into an aid; and so that which is a hindrance is made a furtherance to 
<A NAME="242"></A>an act; and that which is an obstacle on the road helps us on this 
<A NAME="243"></A>road.
<A NAME="244"></A><BR><BR>Reverence that which is best in the universe; and this is that 
<A NAME="245"></A>which makes use of all things and directs all things. And in like manner 
<A NAME="246"></A>also reverence that which is best in thyself; and this is of the same kind 
<A NAME="247"></A>as that. For in thyself also, that which makes use of everything else, 
<A NAME="248"></A>is this, and thy life is directed by this.
<A NAME="249"></A><BR><BR>That which does no harm to the state, does no harm to the citizen. 
<A NAME="250"></A>In the case of every appearance of harm apply this rule: if the state is 
<A NAME="251"></A>not harmed by this, neither am I harmed. But if the state is harmed, thou 
<A NAME="252"></A>must not be angry with him who does harm to the state. Show him where his 
<A NAME="253"></A>error is.
<A NAME="254"></A><BR><BR>Often think of the rapidity with which things pass by and disappear, 
<A NAME="255"></A>both the things which are and the things which are produced. For substance 
<A NAME="256"></A>is like a river in a continual flow, and the activities of things are in 
<A NAME="257"></A>constant change, and the causes work in infinite varieties; and there is 
<A NAME="258"></A>hardly anything which stands still. And consider this which is near to 
<A NAME="259"></A>thee, this boundless abyss of the past and of the future in which all things 
<A NAME="260"></A>disappear. How then is he not a fool who is puffed up with such things 
<A NAME="261"></A>or plagued about them and makes himself miserable? for they vex him only 
<A NAME="262"></A>for a time, and a short time.
<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR>Think of the universal substance, of which thou hast a very small 
<A NAME="264"></A>portion; and of universal time, of which a short and indivisible interval 
<A NAME="265"></A>has been assigned to thee; and of that which is fixed by destiny, and how 
<A NAME="266"></A>small a part of it thou art.
<A NAME="267"></A><BR><BR>Does another do me wrong? Let him look to it. He has his own disposition, 
<A NAME="268"></A>his own activity. I now have what the universal nature wills me to have; 
<A NAME="269"></A>and I do what my nature now wills me to do.
<A NAME="270"></A><BR><BR>Let the part of thy soul which leads and governs be undisturbed 
<A NAME="271"></A>by the movements in the flesh, whether of pleasure or of pain; and let 
<A NAME="272"></A>it not unite with them, but let it circumscribe itself and limit those 
<A NAME="273"></A>affects to their parts. But when these affects rise up to the mind by virtue 
<A NAME="274"></A>of that other sympathy that naturally exists in a body which is all one, 
<A NAME="275"></A>then thou must not strive to resist the sensation, for it is natural: but 
<A NAME="276"></A>let not the ruling part of itself add to the sensation the opinion that 
<A NAME="277"></A>it is either good or bad.
<A NAME="278"></A><BR><BR>Live with the gods. And he does live with the gods who constantly 
<A NAME="279"></A>shows to them, his own soul is satisfied with that which is assigned to 
<A NAME="280"></A>him, and that it does all that the daemon wishes, which Zeus hath given 
<A NAME="281"></A>to every man for his guardian and guide, a portion of himself. And this 
<A NAME="282"></A>is every man's understanding and reason.
<A NAME="283"></A><BR><BR>Art thou angry with him whose armpits stink? Art thou angry with 
<A NAME="284"></A>him whose mouth smells foul? What good will this danger do thee? He has 
<A NAME="285"></A>such a mouth, he has such arm-pits: it is necessary that such an emanation 
<A NAME="286"></A>must come from such things- but the man has reason, it will be said, and 
<A NAME="287"></A>he is able, if he takes pain, to discover wherein he offends- I wish thee 
<A NAME="288"></A>well of thy discovery. Well then, and thou hast reason: by thy rational 
<A NAME="289"></A>faculty stir up his rational faculty; show him his error, admonish him. 
<A NAME="290"></A>For if he listens, thou wilt cure him, and there is no need of anger. Neither 
<A NAME="291"></A>tragic actor nor whore...
<A NAME="292"></A><BR><BR>As thou intendest to live when thou art gone out,...so it is in 
<A NAME="293"></A>thy power to live here. But if men do not permit thee, then get away out 
<A NAME="294"></A>of life, yet so as if thou wert suffering no harm. The house is smoky, 
<A NAME="295"></A>and I quit it. Why dost thou think that this is any trouble? But so long 
<A NAME="296"></A>as nothing of the kind drives me out, I remain, am free, and no man shall 
<A NAME="297"></A>hinder me from doing what I choose; and I choose to do what is according 
<A NAME="298"></A>to the nature of the rational and social animal.
<A NAME="299"></A><BR><BR>The intelligence of the universe is social. Accordingly it has 
<A NAME="300"></A>made the inferior things for the sake of the superior, and it has fitted 
<A NAME="301"></A>the superior to one another. Thou seest how it has subordinated, co-ordinated 
<A NAME="302"></A>and assigned to everything its proper portion, and has brought together 
<A NAME="303"></A>into concord with one another the things which are the 
<A NAME="304"></A>best.
<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR>How hast thou behaved hitherto to the gods, thy parents, brethren, 
<A NAME="306"></A>children, teachers, to those who looked after thy infancy, to thy friends, 
<A NAME="307"></A>kinsfolk, to thy slaves? Consider if thou hast hitherto behaved to all 
<A NAME="308"></A>in such a way that this may be said of thee:
<A NAME="309"></A><BR><BR>Never has wronged a man in deed or word. And call to recollection 
<A NAME="310"></A>both how many things thou hast passed through, and how many things thou 
<A NAME="311"></A>hast been able to endure: and that the history of thy life is now complete 
<A NAME="312"></A>and thy service is ended: and how many beautiful things thou hast seen: 
<A NAME="313"></A>and how many pleasures and pains thou hast despised; and how many things 
<A NAME="314"></A>called honourable thou hast spurned; and to how many ill-minded folks thou 
<A NAME="315"></A>hast shown a kind disposition.
<A NAME="316"></A><BR><BR>Why do unskilled and ignorant souls disturb him who has skill and 
<A NAME="317"></A>knowledge? What soul then has skill and knowledge? That which knows beginning 
<A NAME="318"></A>and end, and knows the reason which pervades all substance and through 
<A NAME="319"></A>all time by fixed periods (revolutions) administers the 
<A NAME="320"></A>universe.
<A NAME="321"></A><BR><BR>Soon, very soon, thou wilt be ashes, or a skeleton, and either 
<A NAME="322"></A>a name or not even a name; but name is sound and echo. And the things which 
<A NAME="323"></A>are much valued in life are empty and rotten and trifling, and like little 
<A NAME="324"></A>dogs biting one another, and little children quarrelling, laughing, and 
<A NAME="325"></A>then straightway weeping. But fidelity and modesty and justice and truth 
<A NAME="326"></A>are fled
<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR>Up to Olympus from the wide-spread earth. What then is there which 
<A NAME="328"></A>still detains thee here? If the objects of sense are easily changed and 
<A NAME="329"></A>never stand still, and the organs of perception are dull and easily receive 
<A NAME="330"></A>false impressions; and the poor soul itself is an exhalation from blood. 
<A NAME="331"></A>But to have good repute amidst such a world as this is an empty thing. 
<A NAME="332"></A>Why then dost thou not wait in tranquility for thy end, whether it is extinction 
<A NAME="333"></A>or removal to another state? And until that time comes, what is sufficient? 
<A NAME="334"></A>Why, what else than to venerate the gods and bless them, and to do good 
<A NAME="335"></A>to men, and to practise tolerance and self-restraint; but as to everything 
<A NAME="336"></A>which is beyond the limits of the poor flesh and breath, to remember that 
<A NAME="337"></A>this is neither thine nor in thy power.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR>Thou canst pass thy life in an equable flow of happiness, if thou 
<A NAME="339"></A>canst go by the right way, and think and act in the right way. These two 
<A NAME="340"></A>things are common both to the soul of God and to the soul of man, and to 
<A NAME="341"></A>the soul of every rational being, not to be hindered by another; and to 
<A NAME="342"></A>hold good to consist in the disposition to justice and the practice of 
<A NAME="343"></A>it, and in this to let thy desire find its termination.
<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR>If this is neither my own badness, nor an effect of my own badness, 
<A NAME="345"></A>and the common weal is not injured, why am I troubled about it? And what 
<A NAME="346"></A>is the harm to the common weal?
<A NAME="347"></A><BR><BR>Do not be carried along inconsiderately by the appearance of things, 
<A NAME="348"></A>but give help to all according to thy ability and their fitness; and if 
<A NAME="349"></A>they should have sustained loss in matters which are indifferent, do not 
<A NAME="350"></A>imagine this to be a damage. For it is a bad habit. But as the old man, 
<A NAME="351"></A>when he went away, asked back his foster-child's top, remembering that 
<A NAME="352"></A>it was a top, so do thou in this case also.
<A NAME="353"></A><BR><BR>When thou art calling out on the Rostra, hast thou forgotten, man, 
<A NAME="354"></A>what these things are?- Yes; but they are objects of great concern to these 
<A NAME="355"></A>people- wilt thou too then be made a fool for these things?- I was once 
<A NAME="356"></A>a fortunate man, but I lost it, I know not how.- But fortunate means that 
<A NAME="357"></A>a man has assigned to himself a good fortune: and a good fortune is good 
<A NAME="358"></A>disposition of the soul, good emotions, good actions.
