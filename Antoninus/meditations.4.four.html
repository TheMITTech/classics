<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>That which rules within, when it is according to nature, is so affected 
<A NAME="11"></A>with respect to the events which happen, that it always easily adapts itself 
<A NAME="12"></A>to that which is and is presented to it. For it requires no definite material, 
<A NAME="13"></A>but it moves towards its purpose, under certain conditions however; and 
<A NAME="14"></A>it makes a material for itself out of that which opposes it, as fire lays 
<A NAME="15"></A>hold of what falls into it, by which a small light would have been extinguished: 
<A NAME="16"></A>but when the fire is strong, it soon appropriates to itself the matter 
<A NAME="17"></A>which is heaped on it, and consumes it, and rises higher by means of this 
<A NAME="18"></A>very material.
<A NAME="19"></A><BR><BR>Let no act be done without a purpose, nor otherwise than according 
<A NAME="20"></A>to the perfect principles of art.
<A NAME="21"></A><BR><BR>Men seek retreats for themselves, houses in the country, sea-shores, 
<A NAME="22"></A>and mountains; and thou too art wont to desire such things very much. But 
<A NAME="23"></A>this is altogether a mark of the most common sort of men, for it is in 
<A NAME="24"></A>thy power whenever thou shalt choose to retire into thyself. For nowhere 
<A NAME="25"></A>either with more quiet or more freedom from trouble does a man retire than 
<A NAME="26"></A>into his own soul, particularly when he has within him such thoughts that 
<A NAME="27"></A>by looking into them he is immediately in perfect tranquility; and I affirm 
<A NAME="28"></A>that tranquility is nothing else than the good ordering of the mind. Constantly 
<A NAME="29"></A>then give to thyself this retreat, and renew thyself; and let thy principles 
<A NAME="30"></A>be brief and fundamental, which, as soon as thou shalt recur to them, will 
<A NAME="31"></A>be sufficient to cleanse the soul completely, and to send thee back free 
<A NAME="32"></A>from all discontent with the things to which thou returnest. For with what 
<A NAME="33"></A>art thou discontented? With the badness of men? Recall to thy mind this 
<A NAME="34"></A>conclusion, that rational animals exist for one another, and that to endure 
<A NAME="35"></A>is a part of justice, and that men do wrong involuntarily; and consider 
<A NAME="36"></A>how many already, after mutual enmity, suspicion, hatred, and fighting, 
<A NAME="37"></A>have been stretched dead, reduced to ashes; and be quiet at last.- But 
<A NAME="38"></A>perhaps thou art dissatisfied with that which is assigned to thee out of 
<A NAME="39"></A>the universe.- Recall to thy recollection this alternative; either there 
<A NAME="40"></A>is providence or atoms, fortuitous concurrence of things; or remember the 
<A NAME="41"></A>arguments by which it has been proved that the world is a kind of political 
<A NAME="42"></A>community, and be quiet at last.- But perhaps corporeal things will still 
<A NAME="43"></A>fasten upon thee.- Consider then further that the mind mingles not with 
<A NAME="44"></A>the breath, whether moving gently or violently, when it has once drawn 
<A NAME="45"></A>itself apart and discovered its own power, and think also of all that thou 
<A NAME="46"></A>hast heard and assented to about pain and pleasure, and be quiet at last.- 
<A NAME="47"></A>But perhaps the desire of the thing called fame will torment thee.- See 
<A NAME="48"></A>how soon everything is forgotten, and look at the chaos of infinite time 
<A NAME="49"></A>on each side of the present, and the emptiness of applause, and the changeableness 
<A NAME="50"></A>and want of judgement in those who pretend to give praise, and the narrowness 
<A NAME="51"></A>of the space within which it is circumscribed, and be quiet at last. For 
<A NAME="52"></A>the whole earth is a point, and how small a nook in it is this thy dwelling, 
<A NAME="53"></A>and how few are there in it, and what kind of people are they who will 
<A NAME="54"></A>praise thee.
<A NAME="55"></A><BR><BR>This then remains: Remember to retire into this little territory 
<A NAME="56"></A>of thy own, and above all do not distract or strain thyself, but be free, 
<A NAME="57"></A>and look at things as a man, as a human being, as a citizen, as a mortal. 
<A NAME="58"></A>But among the things readiest to thy hand to which thou shalt turn, let 
<A NAME="59"></A>there be these, which are two. One is that things do not touch the soul, 
<A NAME="60"></A>for they are external and remain immovable; but our perturbations come 
<A NAME="61"></A>only from the opinion which is within. The other is that all these things, 
<A NAME="62"></A>which thou seest, change immediately and will no longer be; and constantly 
<A NAME="63"></A>bear in mind how many of these changes thou hast already witnessed. The 
<A NAME="64"></A>universe is transformation: life is opinion.
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR>If our intellectual part is common, the reason also, in respect 
<A NAME="66"></A>of which we are rational beings, is common: if this is so, common also 
<A NAME="67"></A>is the reason which commands us what to do, and what not to do; if this 
<A NAME="68"></A>is so, there is a common law also; if this is so, we are fellow-citizens; 
<A NAME="69"></A>if this is so, we are members of some political community; if this is so, 
<A NAME="70"></A>the world is in a manner a state. For of what other common political community 
<A NAME="71"></A>will any one say that the whole human race are members? And from thence, 
<A NAME="72"></A>from this common political community comes also our very intellectual faculty 
<A NAME="73"></A>and reasoning faculty and our capacity for law; or whence do they come? 
<A NAME="74"></A>For as my earthly part is a portion given to me from certain earth, and 
<A NAME="75"></A>that which is watery from another element, and that which is hot and fiery 
<A NAME="76"></A>from some peculiar source (for nothing comes out of that which is nothing, 
<A NAME="77"></A>as nothing also returns to non-existence), so also the intellectual part 
<A NAME="78"></A>comes from some source.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>Death is such as generation is, a mystery of nature; a composition 
<A NAME="80"></A>out of the same elements, and a decomposition into the same; and altogether 
<A NAME="81"></A>not a thing of which any man should be ashamed, for it is not contrary 
<A NAME="82"></A>to the nature of a reasonable animal, and not contrary to the reason of 
<A NAME="83"></A>our constitution.
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><BR>It is natural that these things should be done by such persons, 
<A NAME="85"></A>it is a matter of necessity; and if a man will not have it so, he will 
<A NAME="86"></A>not allow the fig-tree to have juice. But by all means bear this in mind, 
<A NAME="87"></A>that within a very short time both thou and he will be dead; and soon not 
<A NAME="88"></A>even your names will be left behind.
<A NAME="89"></A><BR><BR>Take away thy opinion, and then there is taken away the complaint, 
<A NAME="90"></A>"I have been harmed." Take away the complaint, "I have been harmed," and 
<A NAME="91"></A>the harm is taken away.
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR>That which does not make a man worse than he was, also does not 
<A NAME="93"></A>make his life worse, nor does it harm him either from without or from 
<A NAME="94"></A>within.
<A NAME="95"></A><BR><BR>The nature of that which is universally useful has been compelled 
<A NAME="96"></A>to do this.
<A NAME="97"></A><BR><BR>Consider that everything which happens, happens justly, and if 
<A NAME="98"></A>thou observest carefully, thou wilt find it to be so. I do not say only 
<A NAME="99"></A>with respect to the continuity of the series of things, but with respect 
<A NAME="100"></A>to what is just, and as if it were done by one who assigns to each thing 
<A NAME="101"></A>its value. Observe then as thou hast begun; and whatever thou doest, do 
<A NAME="102"></A>it in conjunction with this, the being good, and in the sense in which 
<A NAME="103"></A>a man is properly understood to be good. Keep to this in every 
<A NAME="104"></A>action.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR>Do not have such an opinion of things as he has who does thee wrong, 
<A NAME="106"></A>or such as he wishes thee to have, but look at them as they are in 
<A NAME="107"></A>truth.
<A NAME="108"></A><BR><BR>A man should always have these two rules in readiness; the one, 
<A NAME="109"></A>to do only whatever the reason of the ruling and legislating faculty may 
<A NAME="110"></A>suggest for the use of men; the other, to change thy opinion, if there 
<A NAME="111"></A>is any one at hand who sets thee right and moves thee from any opinion. 
<A NAME="112"></A>But this change of opinion must proceed only from a certain persuasion, 
<A NAME="113"></A>as of what is just or of common advantage, and the like, not because it 
<A NAME="114"></A>appears pleasant or brings reputation.
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR>Hast thou reason? I have.- Why then dost not thou use it? For if 
<A NAME="116"></A>this does its own work, what else dost thou wish?
<A NAME="117"></A><BR><BR>Thou hast existed as a part. Thou shalt disappear in that which 
<A NAME="118"></A>produced thee; but rather thou shalt be received back into its seminal 
<A NAME="119"></A>principle by transmutation.
<A NAME="120"></A><BR><BR>Many grains of frankincense on the same altar: one falls before, 
<A NAME="121"></A>another falls after; but it makes no difference.
<A NAME="122"></A><BR><BR>Within ten days thou wilt seem a god to those to whom thou art 
<A NAME="123"></A>now a beast and an ape, if thou wilt return to thy principles and the worship 
<A NAME="124"></A>of reason.
<A NAME="125"></A><BR><BR>Do not act as if thou wert going to live ten thousand years. Death 
<A NAME="126"></A>hangs over thee. While thou livest, while it is in thy power, be 
<A NAME="127"></A>good.
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR>How much trouble he avoids who does not look to see what his neighbour 
<A NAME="129"></A>says or does or thinks, but only to what he does himself, that it may be 
<A NAME="130"></A>just and pure; or as Agathon says, look not round at the depraved morals 
<A NAME="131"></A>of others, but run straight along the line without deviating from 
<A NAME="132"></A>it.
<A NAME="133"></A><BR><BR>He who has a vehement desire for posthumous fame does not consider 
<A NAME="134"></A>that every one of those who remember him will himself also die very soon; 
<A NAME="135"></A>then again also they who have succeeded them, until the whole remembrance 
<A NAME="136"></A>shall have been extinguished as it is transmitted through men who foolishly 
<A NAME="137"></A>admire and perish. But suppose that those who will remember are even immortal, 
<A NAME="138"></A>and that the remembrance will be immortal, what then is this to thee? And 
<A NAME="139"></A>I say not what is it to the dead, but what is it to the living? What is 
<A NAME="140"></A>praise except indeed so far as it has a certain utility? For thou now rejectest 
<A NAME="141"></A>unseasonably the gift of nature, clinging to something 
<A NAME="142"></A>else...
<A NAME="143"></A><BR><BR>Everything which is in any way beautiful is beautiful in itself, 
<A NAME="144"></A>and terminates in itself, not having praise as part of itself. Neither 
<A NAME="145"></A>worse then nor better is a thing made by being praised. I affirm this also 
<A NAME="146"></A>of the things which are called beautiful by the vulgar, for example, material 
<A NAME="147"></A>things and works of art. That which is really beautiful has no need of 
<A NAME="148"></A>anything; not more than law, not more than truth, not more than benevolence 
<A NAME="149"></A>or modesty. Which of these things is beautiful because it is praised, or 
<A NAME="150"></A>spoiled by being blamed? Is such a thing as an emerald made worse than 
<A NAME="151"></A>it was, if it is not praised? Or gold, ivory, purple, a lyre, a little 
<A NAME="152"></A>knife, a flower, a shrub?
<A NAME="153"></A><BR><BR>If souls continue to exist, how does the air contain them from 
<A NAME="154"></A>eternity?- But how does the earth contain the bodies of those who have 
<A NAME="155"></A>been buried from time so remote? For as here the mutation of these bodies 
<A NAME="156"></A>after a certain continuance, whatever it may be, and their dissolution 
<A NAME="157"></A>make room for other dead bodies; so the souls which are removed into the 
<A NAME="158"></A>air after subsisting for some time are transmuted and diffused, and assume 
<A NAME="159"></A>a fiery nature by being received into the seminal intelligence of the universe, 
<A NAME="160"></A>and in this way make room for the fresh souls which come to dwell there. 
<A NAME="161"></A>And this is the answer which a man might give on the hypothesis of souls 
<A NAME="162"></A>continuing to exist. But we must not only think of the number of bodies 
<A NAME="163"></A>which are thus buried, but also of the number of animals which are daily 
<A NAME="164"></A>eaten by us and the other animals. For what a number is consumed, and thus 
<A NAME="165"></A>in a manner buried in the bodies of those who feed on them! And nevertheless 
<A NAME="166"></A>this earth receives them by reason of the changes of these bodies into 
<A NAME="167"></A>blood, and the transformations into the aerial or the fiery 
<A NAME="168"></A>element.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>What is the investigation into the truth in this matter? The division 
<A NAME="170"></A>into that which is material and that which is the cause of form, the 
<A NAME="171"></A>formal.
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR>Do not be whirled about, but in every movement have respect to 
<A NAME="173"></A>justice, and on the occasion of every impression maintain the faculty of 
<A NAME="174"></A>comprehension or understanding.
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR>Everything harmonizes with me, which is harmonious to thee, O Universe. 
<A NAME="176"></A>Nothing for me is too early nor too late, which is in due time for thee. 
<A NAME="177"></A>Everything is fruit to me which thy seasons bring, O Nature: from thee 
<A NAME="178"></A>are all things, in thee are all things, to thee all things return. The 
<A NAME="179"></A>poet says, Dear city of Cecrops; and wilt not thou say, Dear city of 
<A NAME="180"></A>Zeus?
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR>Occupy thyself with few things, says the philosopher, if thou wouldst 
<A NAME="182"></A>be tranquil.- But consider if it would not be better to say, Do what is 
<A NAME="183"></A>necessary, and whatever the reason of the animal which is naturally social 
<A NAME="184"></A>requires, and as it requires. For this brings not only the tranquility 
<A NAME="185"></A>which comes from doing well, but also that which comes from doing few things. 
<A NAME="186"></A>For the greatest part of what we say and do being unnecessary, if a man 
<A NAME="187"></A>takes this away, he will have more leisure and less uneasiness. Accordingly 
<A NAME="188"></A>on every occasion a man should ask himself, Is this one of the unnecessary 
<A NAME="189"></A>things? Now a man should take away not only unnecessary acts, but also, 
<A NAME="190"></A>unnecessary thoughts, for thus superfluous acts will not follow 
<A NAME="191"></A>after.
<A NAME="192"></A><BR><BR>Try how the life of the good man suits thee, the life of him who 
<A NAME="193"></A>is satisfied with his portion out of the whole, and satisfied with his 
<A NAME="194"></A>own just acts and benevolent disposition.
<A NAME="195"></A><BR><BR>Hast thou seen those things? Look also at these. Do not disturb 
<A NAME="196"></A>thyself. Make thyself all simplicity. Does any one do wrong? It is to himself 
<A NAME="197"></A>that he does the wrong. Has anything happened to thee? Well; out of the 
<A NAME="198"></A>universe from the beginning everything which happens has been apportioned 
<A NAME="199"></A>and spun out to thee. In a word, thy life is short. Thou must turn to profit 
<A NAME="200"></A>the present by the aid of reason and justice. Be sober in thy 
<A NAME="201"></A>relaxation.
<A NAME="202"></A><BR><BR>Either it is a well-arranged universe or a chaos huddled together, 
<A NAME="203"></A>but still a universe. But can a certain order subsist in thee, and disorder 
<A NAME="204"></A>in the All? And this too when all things are so separated and diffused 
<A NAME="205"></A>and sympathetic.
<A NAME="206"></A><BR><BR>A black character, a womanish character, a stubborn character, 
<A NAME="207"></A>bestial, childish, animal, stupid, counterfeit, scurrilous, fraudulent, 
<A NAME="208"></A>tyrannical.
<A NAME="209"></A><BR><BR>If he is a stranger to the universe who does not know what is in 
<A NAME="210"></A>it, no less is he a stranger who does not know what is going on in it. 
<A NAME="211"></A>He is a runaway, who flies from social reason; he is blind, who shuts the 
<A NAME="212"></A>eyes of the understanding; he is poor, who has need of another, and has 
<A NAME="213"></A>not from himself all things which are useful for life. He is an abscess 
<A NAME="214"></A>on the universe who withdraws and separates himself from the reason of 
<A NAME="215"></A>our common nature through being displeased with the things which happen, 
<A NAME="216"></A>for the same nature produces this, and has produced thee too: he is a piece 
<A NAME="217"></A>rent asunder from the state, who tears his own soul from that of reasonable 
<A NAME="218"></A>animals, which is one.
<A NAME="219"></A><BR><BR>The one is a philosopher without a tunic, and the other without 
<A NAME="220"></A>a book: here is another half naked: Bread I have not, he says, and I abide 
<A NAME="221"></A>by reason.- And I do not get the means of living out of my learning, and 
<A NAME="222"></A>I abide by my reason.
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR>Love the art, poor as it may be, which thou hast learned, and be 
<A NAME="224"></A>content with it; and pass through the rest of life like one who has intrusted 
<A NAME="225"></A>to the gods with his whole soul all that he has, making thyself neither 
<A NAME="226"></A>the tyrant nor the slave of any man.
<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR>Consider, for example, the times of Vespasian. Thou wilt see all 
<A NAME="228"></A>these things, people marrying, bringing up children, sick, dying, warring, 
<A NAME="229"></A>feasting, trafficking, cultivating the ground, flattering, obstinately 
<A NAME="230"></A>arrogant, suspecting, plotting, wishing for some to die, grumbling about 
<A NAME="231"></A>the present, loving, heaping up treasure, desiring counsulship, kingly 
<A NAME="232"></A>power. Well then, that life of these people no longer exists at all. Again, 
<A NAME="233"></A>remove to the times of Trajan. Again, all is the same. Their life too is 
<A NAME="234"></A>gone. In like manner view also the other epochs of time and of whole nations, 
<A NAME="235"></A>and see how many after great efforts soon fell and were resolved into the 
<A NAME="236"></A>elements. But chiefly thou shouldst think of those whom thou hast thyself 
<A NAME="237"></A>known distracting themselves about idle things, neglecting to do what was 
<A NAME="238"></A>in accordance with their proper constitution, and to hold firmly to this 
<A NAME="239"></A>and to be content with it. And herein it is necessary to remember that 
<A NAME="240"></A>the attention given to everything has its proper value and proportion. 
<A NAME="241"></A>For thus thou wilt not be dissatisfied, if thou appliest thyself to smaller 
<A NAME="242"></A>matters no further than is fit.
<A NAME="243"></A><BR><BR>The words which were formerly familiar are now antiquated: so also 
<A NAME="244"></A>the names of those who were famed of old, are now in a manner antiquated, 
<A NAME="245"></A>Camillus, Caeso, Volesus, Leonnatus, and a little after also Scipio and 
<A NAME="246"></A>Cato, then Augustus, then also Hadrian and Antoninus. For all things soon 
<A NAME="247"></A>pass away and become a mere tale, and complete oblivion soon buries them. 
<A NAME="248"></A>And I say this of those who have shone in a wondrous way. For the rest, 
<A NAME="249"></A>as soon as they have breathed out their breath, they are gone, and no man 
<A NAME="250"></A>speaks of them. And, to conclude the matter, what is even an eternal remembrance? 
<A NAME="251"></A>A mere nothing. What then is that about which we ought to employ our serious 
<A NAME="252"></A>pains? This one thing, thoughts just, and acts social, and words which 
<A NAME="253"></A>never lie, and a disposition which gladly accepts all that happens, as 
<A NAME="254"></A>necessary, as usual, as flowing from a principle and source of the same 
<A NAME="255"></A>kind.
<A NAME="256"></A><BR><BR>Willingly give thyself up to Clotho, one of the Fates, allowing 
<A NAME="257"></A>her to spin thy thread into whatever things she pleases.
<A NAME="258"></A><BR><BR>Everything is only for a day, both that which remembers and that 
<A NAME="259"></A>which is remembered.
<A NAME="260"></A><BR><BR>Observe constantly that all things take place by change, and accustom 
<A NAME="261"></A>thyself to consider that the nature of the Universe loves nothing so much 
<A NAME="262"></A>as to change the things which are and to make new things like them. For 
<A NAME="263"></A>everything that exists is in a manner the seed of that which will be. But 
<A NAME="264"></A>thou art thinking only of seeds which are cast into the earth or into a 
<A NAME="265"></A>womb: but this is a very vulgar notion.
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR>Thou wilt soon die, and thou art not yet simple, not free from 
<A NAME="267"></A>perturbations, nor without suspicion of being hurt by external things, 
<A NAME="268"></A>nor kindly disposed towards all; nor dost thou yet place wisdom only in 
<A NAME="269"></A>acting justly.
<A NAME="270"></A><BR><BR>Examine men's ruling principles, even those of the wise, what kind 
<A NAME="271"></A>of things they avoid, and what kind they pursue.
<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR>What is evil to thee does not subsist in the ruling principle of 
<A NAME="273"></A>another; nor yet in any turning and mutation of thy corporeal covering. 
<A NAME="274"></A>Where is it then? It is in that part of thee in which subsists the power 
<A NAME="275"></A>of forming opinions about evils. Let this power then not form such opinions, 
<A NAME="276"></A>and all is well. And if that which is nearest to it, the poor body, is 
<A NAME="277"></A>burnt, filled with matter and rottenness, nevertheless let the part which 
<A NAME="278"></A>forms opinions about these things be quiet, that is, let it judge that 
<A NAME="279"></A>nothing is either bad or good which can happen equally to the bad man and 
<A NAME="280"></A>the good. For that which happens equally to him who lives contrary to nature 
<A NAME="281"></A>and to him who lives according to nature, is neither according to nature 
<A NAME="282"></A>nor contrary to nature.
<A NAME="283"></A><BR><BR>Constantly regard the universe as one living being, having one 
<A NAME="284"></A>substance and one soul; and observe how all things have reference to one 
<A NAME="285"></A>perception, the perception of this one living being; and how all things 
<A NAME="286"></A>act with one movement; and how all things are the cooperating causes of 
<A NAME="287"></A>all things which exist; observe too the continuous spinning of the thread 
<A NAME="288"></A>and the contexture of the web.
<A NAME="289"></A><BR><BR>Thou art a little soul bearing about a corpse, as Epictetus used 
<A NAME="290"></A>to say.
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR>It is no evil for things to undergo change, and no good for things 
<A NAME="292"></A>to subsist in consequence of change.
<A NAME="293"></A><BR><BR>Time is like a river made up of the events which happen, and a 
<A NAME="294"></A>violent stream; for as soon as a thing has been seen, it is carried away, 
<A NAME="295"></A>and another comes in its place, and this will be carried away 
<A NAME="296"></A>too.
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR>Everything which happens is as familiar and well known as the rose 
<A NAME="298"></A>in spring and the fruit in summer; for such is disease, and death, and 
<A NAME="299"></A>calumny, and treachery, and whatever else delights fools or vexes 
<A NAME="300"></A>them.
<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR>In the series of things those which follow are always aptly fitted 
<A NAME="302"></A>to those which have gone before; for this series is not like a mere enumeration 
<A NAME="303"></A>of disjointed things, which has only a necessary sequence, but it is a 
<A NAME="304"></A>rational connection: and as all existing things are arranged together harmoniously, 
<A NAME="305"></A>so the things which come into existence exhibit no mere succession, but 
<A NAME="306"></A>a certain wonderful relationship.
<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR>Always remember the saying of Heraclitus, that the death of earth 
<A NAME="308"></A>is to become water, and the death of water is to become air, and the death 
<A NAME="309"></A>of air is to become fire, and reversely. And think too of him who forgets 
<A NAME="310"></A>whither the way leads, and that men quarrel with that with which they are 
<A NAME="311"></A>most constantly in communion, the reason which governs the universe; and 
<A NAME="312"></A>the things which daily meet with seem to them strange: and consider that 
<A NAME="313"></A>we ought not to act and speak as if we were asleep, for even in sleep we 
<A NAME="314"></A>seem to act and speak; and that we ought not, like children who learn from 
<A NAME="315"></A>their parents, simply to act and speak as we have been 
<A NAME="316"></A>taught.
<A NAME="317"></A><BR><BR>If any god told thee that thou shalt die to-morrow, or certainly 
<A NAME="318"></A>on the day after to-morrow, thou wouldst not care much whether it was on 
<A NAME="319"></A>the third day or on the morrow, unless thou wast in the highest degree 
<A NAME="320"></A>mean-spirited- for how small is the difference?- So think it no great thing 
<A NAME="321"></A>to die after as many years as thou canst name rather than 
<A NAME="322"></A>to-morrow.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR><BR>Think continually how many physicians are dead after often contracting 
<A NAME="324"></A>their eyebrows over the sick; and how many astrologers after predicting 
<A NAME="325"></A>with great pretensions the deaths of others; and how many philosophers 
<A NAME="326"></A>after endless discourses on death or immortality; how many heroes after 
<A NAME="327"></A>killing thousands; and how many tyrants who have used their power over 
<A NAME="328"></A>men's lives with terrible insolence as if they were immortal; and how many 
<A NAME="329"></A>cities are entirely dead, so to speak, Helice and Pompeii and Herculaneum, 
<A NAME="330"></A>and others innumerable. Add to the reckoning all whom thou hast known, 
<A NAME="331"></A>one after another. One man after burying another has been laid out dead, 
<A NAME="332"></A>and another buries him: and all this in a short time. To conclude, always 
<A NAME="333"></A>observe how ephemeral and worthless human things are, and what was yesterday 
<A NAME="334"></A>a little mucus to-morrow will be a mummy or ashes. Pass then through this 
<A NAME="335"></A>little space of time conformably to nature, and end thy journey in content, 
<A NAME="336"></A>just as an olive falls off when it is ripe, blessing nature who produced 
<A NAME="337"></A>it, and thanking the tree on which it grew.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR>Be like the promontory against which the waves continually break, 
<A NAME="339"></A>but it stands firm and tames the fury of the water around 
<A NAME="340"></A>it.
<A NAME="341"></A><BR><BR>Unhappy am I because this has happened to me.- Not so, but happy 
<A NAME="342"></A>am I, though this has happened to me, because I continue free from pain, 
<A NAME="343"></A>neither crushed by the present nor fearing the future. For such a thing 
<A NAME="344"></A>as this might have happened to every man; but every man would not have 
<A NAME="345"></A>continued free from pain on such an occasion. Why then is that rather a 
<A NAME="346"></A>misfortune than this a good fortune? And dost thou in all cases call that 
<A NAME="347"></A>a man's misfortune, which is not a deviation from man's nature? And does 
<A NAME="348"></A>a thing seem to thee to be a deviation from man's nature, when it is not 
<A NAME="349"></A>contrary to the will of man's nature? Well, thou knowest the will of nature. 
<A NAME="350"></A>Will then this which has happened prevent thee from being just, magnanimous, 
<A NAME="351"></A>temperate, prudent, secure against inconsiderate opinions and falsehood; 
<A NAME="352"></A>will it prevent thee from having modesty, freedom, and everything else, 
<A NAME="353"></A>by the presence of which man's nature obtains all that is its own? Remember 
<A NAME="354"></A>too on every occasion which leads thee to vexation to apply this principle: 
<A NAME="355"></A>not that this is a misfortune, but that to bear it nobly is good 
<A NAME="356"></A>fortune.
<A NAME="357"></A><BR><BR>It is a vulgar, but still a useful help towards contempt of death, 
<A NAME="358"></A>to pass in review those who have tenaciously stuck to life. What more then 
<A NAME="359"></A>have they gained than those who have died early? Certainly they lie in 
<A NAME="360"></A>their tombs somewhere at last, Cadicianus, Fabius, Julianus, Lepidus, or 
<A NAME="361"></A>any one else like them, who have carried out many to be buried, and then 
<A NAME="362"></A>were carried out themselves. Altogether the interval is small between birth 
<A NAME="363"></A>and death; and consider with how much trouble, and in company with what 
<A NAME="364"></A>sort of people and in what a feeble body this interval is laboriously passed. 
<A NAME="365"></A>Do not then consider life a thing of any value. For look to the immensity 
<A NAME="366"></A>of time behind thee, and to the time which is before thee, another boundless 
<A NAME="367"></A>space. In this infinity then what is the difference between him who lives 
<A NAME="368"></A>three days and him who lives three generations?
<A NAME="369"></A><BR><BR>Always run to the short way; and the short way is the natural: 
<A NAME="370"></A>accordingly say and do everything in conformity with the soundest reason. 
<A NAME="371"></A>For such a purpose frees a man from trouble, and warfare, and all artifice 
<A NAME="372"></A>and ostentatious display.
