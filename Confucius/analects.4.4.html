<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 16</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>The head of the Chi family was going to attack Chwan-yu.
<A NAME="12"></A><BR>Zan Yu and Chi-lu had an interview with Confucius, and said, "Our chief, 
<A NAME="13"></A>Chil is going to commence operations against Chwan-yu."
<A NAME="14"></A><BR><BR>Confucius said, "Ch'iu, is it not you who are in fault 
<A NAME="15"></A>here?
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>"Now, in regard to Chwan-yu, long ago, a former king appointed its 
<A NAME="17"></A>ruler to preside over the sacrifices to the eastern Mang; moreover, it 
<A NAME="18"></A>is in the midst of the territory of our state; and its ruler is a minister 
<A NAME="19"></A>in direct connection with the sovereign: What has your chief to do with 
<A NAME="20"></A>attacking it?"
<A NAME="21"></A><BR><BR>Zan Yu said, "Our master wishes the thing; neither of us two ministers 
<A NAME="22"></A>wishes it."
<A NAME="23"></A><BR><BR>Confucius said, "Ch'iu, there are the words of Chau Zan, -'When 
<A NAME="24"></A>he can put forth his ability, he takes his place in the ranks of office; 
<A NAME="25"></A>when he finds himself unable to do so, he retires from it. How can he be 
<A NAME="26"></A>used as a guide to a blind man, who does not support him when tottering, 
<A NAME="27"></A>nor raise him up when fallen?'
<A NAME="28"></A><BR><BR>"And further, you speak wrongly. When a tiger or rhinoceros escapes 
<A NAME="29"></A>from his cage; when a tortoise or piece of jade is injured in its repository:-whose 
<A NAME="30"></A>is the fault?"
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR>Zan Yu said, "But at present, Chwan-yu is strong and near to Pi; 
<A NAME="32"></A>if our chief do not now take it, it will hereafter be a sorrow to his 
<A NAME="33"></A>descendants."
<A NAME="34"></A><BR><BR>Confucius said. "Ch'iu, the superior man hates those declining 
<A NAME="35"></A>to say-'I want such and such a thing,' and framing explanations for their 
<A NAME="36"></A>conduct.
<A NAME="37"></A><BR><BR>"I have heard that rulers of states and chiefs of families are 
<A NAME="38"></A>not troubled lest their people should be few, but are troubled lest they 
<A NAME="39"></A>should not keep their several places; that they are not troubled with fears 
<A NAME="40"></A>of poverty, but are troubled with fears of a want of contented repose among 
<A NAME="41"></A>the people in their several places. For when the people keep their several 
<A NAME="42"></A>places, there will be no poverty; when harmony prevails, there will be 
<A NAME="43"></A>no scarcity of people; and when there is such a contented repose, there 
<A NAME="44"></A>will be no rebellious upsettings.
<A NAME="45"></A><BR><BR>"So it is.-Therefore, if remoter people are not submissive, all 
<A NAME="46"></A>the influences of civil culture and virtue are to be cultivated to attract 
<A NAME="47"></A>them to be so; and when they have been so attracted, they must be made 
<A NAME="48"></A>contented and tranquil.
<A NAME="49"></A><BR><BR>"Now, here are you, Yu and Ch'iu, assisting your chief. Remoter 
<A NAME="50"></A>people are not submissive, and, with your help, he cannot attract them 
<A NAME="51"></A>to him. In his own territory there are divisions and downfalls, leavings 
<A NAME="52"></A>and separations, and, with your help, he cannot preserve 
<A NAME="53"></A>it.
<A NAME="54"></A><BR><BR>"And yet he is planning these hostile movements within the state.-I 
<A NAME="55"></A>am afraid that the sorrow of the Chi-sun family will not be on account 
<A NAME="56"></A>of Chwan-yu, but will be found within the screen of their own 
<A NAME="57"></A>court."
<A NAME="58"></A><BR><BR>Confucius said, "When good government prevails in the empire, ceremonies, 
<A NAME="59"></A>music, and punitive military expeditions proceed from the son of Heaven. 
<A NAME="60"></A>When bad government prevails in the empire, ceremonies, music, and punitive 
<A NAME="61"></A>military expeditions proceed from the princes. When these things proceed 
<A NAME="62"></A>from the princes, as a rule, the cases will be few in which they do not 
<A NAME="63"></A>lose their power in ten generations. When they proceed from the great officers 
<A NAME="64"></A>of the princes, as a rule, the case will be few in which they do not lose 
<A NAME="65"></A>their power in five generations. When the subsidiary ministers of the great 
<A NAME="66"></A>officers hold in their grasp the orders of the state, as a rule the cases 
<A NAME="67"></A>will be few in which they do not lose their power in three 
<A NAME="68"></A>generations.
<A NAME="69"></A><BR><BR>"When right principles prevail in the kingdom, government will 
<A NAME="70"></A>not be in the hands of the great officers.
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>"When right principles prevail in the kingdom, there will be no 
<A NAME="72"></A>discussions among the common people."
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>Confucius said, "The revenue of the state has left the ducal house 
<A NAME="74"></A>now for five generations. The government has been in the hands of the great 
<A NAME="75"></A>officers for four generations. On this account, the descendants of the 
<A NAME="76"></A>three Hwan are much reduced."
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>Confucius said, "There are three friendships which are advantageous, 
<A NAME="78"></A>and three which are injurious. Friendship with the uplight; friendship 
<A NAME="79"></A>with the sincere; and friendship with the man of much observation:-these 
<A NAME="80"></A>are advantageous. Friendship with the man of specious airs; friendship 
<A NAME="81"></A>with the insinuatingly soft; and friendship with the glib-tongued:-these 
<A NAME="82"></A>are injurious."
<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR>Confucius said, "There are three things men find enjoyment in which 
<A NAME="84"></A>are advantageous, and three things they find enjoyment in which are injurious. 
<A NAME="85"></A>To find enjoyment in the discriminating study of ceremonies and music; 
<A NAME="86"></A>to find enjoyment in speaking of the goodness of others; to find enjoyment 
<A NAME="87"></A>in having many worthy friends:-these are advantageous. To find enjoyment 
<A NAME="88"></A>in extravagant pleasures; to find enjoyment in idleness and sauntering; 
<A NAME="89"></A>to find enjoyment in the pleasures of feasting:-these are 
<A NAME="90"></A>injurious."
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR>Confucius said, "There are three errors to which they who stand 
<A NAME="92"></A>in the presence of a man of virtue and station are liable. They may speak 
<A NAME="93"></A>when it does not come to them to speak;-this is called rashness. They may 
<A NAME="94"></A>not speak when it comes to them to speak;-this is called concealment. They 
<A NAME="95"></A>may speak without looking at the countenance of their superior;-this is 
<A NAME="96"></A>called blindness."
<A NAME="97"></A><BR><BR>Confucius said, "There are three things which the superior man 
<A NAME="98"></A>guards against. In youth, when the physical powers are not yet settled, 
<A NAME="99"></A>he guards against lust. When he is strong and the physical powers are full 
<A NAME="100"></A>of vigor, he guards against quarrelsomeness. When he is old, and the animal 
<A NAME="101"></A>powers are decayed, he guards against covetousness."
<A NAME="102"></A><BR><BR>Confucius said, "There are three things of which the superior man 
<A NAME="103"></A>stands in awe. He stands in awe of the ordinances of Heaven. He stands 
<A NAME="104"></A>in awe of great men. He stands in awe of the words of 
<A NAME="105"></A>sages.
<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR>"The mean man does not know the ordinances of Heaven, and consequently 
<A NAME="107"></A>does not stand in awe of them. He is disrespectful to great men. He makes 
<A NAME="108"></A>sport of the words of sages."
<A NAME="109"></A><BR><BR>Confucius said, "Those who are born with the possession of knowledge 
<A NAME="110"></A>are the highest class of men. Those who learn, and so readily get possession 
<A NAME="111"></A>of knowledge, are the next. Those who are dull and stupid, and yet compass 
<A NAME="112"></A>the learning, are another class next to these. As to those who are dull 
<A NAME="113"></A>and stupid and yet do not learn;-they are the lowest of the 
<A NAME="114"></A>people."
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR>Confucius said, "The superior man has nine things which are subjects 
<A NAME="116"></A>with him of thoughtful consideration. In regard to the use of his eyes, 
<A NAME="117"></A>he is anxious to see clearly. In regard to the use of his ears, he is anxious 
<A NAME="118"></A>to hear distinctly. In regard to his countenance, he is anxious that it 
<A NAME="119"></A>should be benign. In regard to his demeanor, he is anxious that it should 
<A NAME="120"></A>be respectful. In regard to his speech, he is anxious that it should be 
<A NAME="121"></A>sincere. In regard to his doing of business, he is anxious that it should 
<A NAME="122"></A>be reverently careful. In regard to what he doubts about, he is anxious 
<A NAME="123"></A>to question others. When he is angry, he thinks of the difficulties his 
<A NAME="124"></A>anger may involve him in. When he sees gain to be got, he thinks of 
<A NAME="125"></A>righteousness."
<A NAME="126"></A><BR><BR>Confucius said, "Contemplating good, and pursuing it, as if they 
<A NAME="127"></A>could not reach it; contemplating evil! and shrinking from it, as they 
<A NAME="128"></A>would from thrusting the hand into boiling water:-I have seen such men, 
<A NAME="129"></A>as I have heard such words.
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR>"Living in retirement to study their aims, and practicing righteousness 
<A NAME="131"></A>to carry out their principles:-I have heard these words, but I have not 
<A NAME="132"></A>seen such men."
<A NAME="133"></A><BR><BR>The Duke Ching of Ch'i had a thousand teams, each of four horses, 
<A NAME="134"></A>but on the day of his death, the people did not praise him for a single 
<A NAME="135"></A>virtue. Po-i and Shu-ch'i died of hunger at the foot of the Shau-yang mountains, 
<A NAME="136"></A>and the people, down to the present time, praise them.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR><BR>"Is not that saying illustrated by this?"
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>Ch'an K'ang asked Po-yu, saying, "Have you heard any lessons from your 
<A NAME="139"></A>father different from what we have all heard?"
<A NAME="140"></A><BR><BR>Po-yu replied, "No. He was standing alone once, when I passed below 
<A NAME="141"></A>the hall with hasty steps, and said to me, 'Have you learned the Odes?' 
<A NAME="142"></A>On my replying 'Not yet,' he added, If you do not learn the Odes, you will 
<A NAME="143"></A>not be fit to converse with.' I retired and studied the 
<A NAME="144"></A>Odes.
<A NAME="145"></A><BR><BR>"Another day, he was in the same way standing alone, when I passed 
<A NAME="146"></A>by below the hall with hasty steps, and said to me, 'Have you learned the 
<A NAME="147"></A>rules of Propriety?' On my replying 'Not yet,' he added, 'If you do not 
<A NAME="148"></A>learn the rules of Propriety, your character cannot be established.' I 
<A NAME="149"></A>then retired, and learned the rules of Propriety.
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR>"I have heard only these two things from him."
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>Ch'ang K'ang retired, and, quite delighted, said, "I asked one thing, 
<A NAME="152"></A>and I have got three things. I have heard about the Odes. I have heard 
<A NAME="153"></A>about the rules of Propriety. I have also heard that the superior man maintains 
<A NAME="154"></A>a distant reserve towards his son."
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR>The wife of the prince of a state is called by him Fu Zan. She 
<A NAME="156"></A>calls herself Hsiao T'ung. The people of the state call her Chun Fu Zan, 
<A NAME="157"></A>and, to the people of other states, they call her K'wa Hsiao Chun. The 
<A NAME="158"></A>people of other states also call her Chun Fu Zan.

<A NAME="159"></A><B>Part 17</B>

<A NAME="160"></A><BR><BR>Yang Ho wished to see Confucius, but Confucius would not go to 
<A NAME="161"></A>see him. On this, he sent a present of a pig to Confucius, who, having 
<A NAME="162"></A>chosen a time when Ho was not at home went to pay his respects for the 
<A NAME="163"></A>gift. He met him, however, on the way.
<A NAME="164"></A><BR><BR>Ho said to Confucius, "Come, let me speak with you." He then asked, 
<A NAME="165"></A>"Can he be called benevolent who keeps his jewel in his bosom, and leaves 
<A NAME="166"></A>his country to confusion?" Confucius replied, "No." "Can he be called wise, 
<A NAME="167"></A>who is anxious to be engaged in public employment, and yet is constantly 
<A NAME="168"></A>losing the opportunity of being so?" Confucius again said, "No." "The days 
<A NAME="169"></A>and months are passing away; the years do not wait for us." Confucius said, 
<A NAME="170"></A>"Right; I will go into office."
<A NAME="171"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "By nature, men are nearly alike; by practice, 
<A NAME="172"></A>they get to be wide apart."
<A NAME="173"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "There are only the wise of the highest class, 
<A NAME="174"></A>and the stupid of the lowest class, who cannot be changed."
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR>The Master, having come to Wu-ch'ang, heard there the sound of 
<A NAME="176"></A>stringed instruments and singing.
<A NAME="177"></A><BR><BR>Well pleased and smiling, he said, "Why use an ox knife to kill 
<A NAME="178"></A>a fowl?"
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-yu replied, "Formerly, Master, I heard you say,-'When the 
<A NAME="180"></A>man of high station is well instructed, he loves men; when the man of low 
<A NAME="181"></A>station is well instructed, he is easily ruled.'"
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "My disciples, Yen's words are right. What I said 
<A NAME="183"></A>was only in sport."
<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR>Kung-shan Fu-zao, when he was holding Pi, and in an attitude of 
<A NAME="185"></A>rebellion, invited the Master to visit him, who was rather inclined to 
<A NAME="186"></A>go.
<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-lu was displeased. and said, "Indeed, you cannot go! Why must 
<A NAME="188"></A>you think of going to see Kung-shan?"
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Can it be without some reason that he has invited 
<A NAME="190"></A>ME? If any one employ me, may I not make an eastern 
<A NAME="191"></A>Chau?"
<A NAME="192"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-chang asked Confucius about perfect virtue. Confucius said, 
<A NAME="193"></A>"To be able to practice five things everywhere under heaven constitutes 
<A NAME="194"></A>perfect virtue." He begged to ask what they were, and was told, "Gravity, 
<A NAME="195"></A>generosity of soul, sincerity, earnestness, and kindness. If you are grave, 
<A NAME="196"></A>you will not be treated with disrespect. If you are generous, you will 
<A NAME="197"></A>win all. If you are sincere, people will repose trust in you. If you are 
<A NAME="198"></A>earnest, you will accomplish much. If you are kind, this will enable you 
<A NAME="199"></A>to employ the services of others.
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR>Pi Hsi inviting him to visit him, the Master was inclined to 
<A NAME="201"></A>go.
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>Tsze-lu said, "Master, formerly I have heard you say, 'When a man in 
<A NAME="203"></A>his own person is guilty of doing evil, a superior man will not associate 
<A NAME="204"></A>with him.' Pi Hsi is in rebellion, holding possession of Chung-mau; if 
<A NAME="205"></A>you go to him, what shall be said?"
<A NAME="206"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Yes, I did use these words. But is it not said, 
<A NAME="207"></A>that, if a thing be really hard, it may be ground without being made thin? 
<A NAME="208"></A>Is it not said, that, if a thing be really white, it may be steeped in 
<A NAME="209"></A>a dark fluid without being made black?
<A NAME="210"></A><BR><BR>"Am I a bitter gourd? How can I be hung up out of the way of being 
<A NAME="211"></A>eaten?"
<A NAME="212"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Yu, have you heard the six words to which are 
<A NAME="213"></A>attached six becloudings?" Yu replied, "I have not."
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR>"Sit down, and I will tell them to you.
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>"There is the love of being benevolent without the love of learning;-the 
<A NAME="216"></A>beclouding here leads to a foolish simplicity. There is the love of knowing 
<A NAME="217"></A>without the love of learning;-the beclouding here leads to dissipation 
<A NAME="218"></A>of mind. There is the love of being sincere without the love of learning;-the 
<A NAME="219"></A>beclouding here leads to an injurious disregard of consequences. There 
<A NAME="220"></A>is the love of straightforwardness without the love of learning;-the beclouding 
<A NAME="221"></A>here leads to rudeness. There is the love of boldness without the love 
<A NAME="222"></A>of learning;-the beclouding here leads to insubordination. There is the 
<A NAME="223"></A>love of firmness without the love of learning;-the beclouding here leads 
<A NAME="224"></A>to extravagant conduct."
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "My children, why do you not study the Book of 
<A NAME="226"></A>Poetry?
<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR>"The Odes serve to stimulate the mind.
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>"They may be used for purposes of self-contemplation.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>"They teach the art of sociability.
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>"They show how to regulate feelings of resentment.
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>"From them you learn the more immediate duty of serving one's father, 
<A NAME="232"></A>and the remoter one of serving one's prince.
<A NAME="233"></A><BR><BR>"From them we become largely acquainted with the names of birds, 
<A NAME="234"></A>beasts, and plants."
<A NAME="235"></A><BR><BR>The Master said to Po-yu, "Do you give yourself to the Chau-nan 
<A NAME="236"></A>and the Shao-nan. The man who has not studied the Chau-nan and the Shao-nan 
<A NAME="237"></A>is like one who stands with his face right against a wall. Is he not so?" 
<A NAME="238"></A>The Master said, "'It is according to the rules of propriety,' they say.-'It 
<A NAME="239"></A>is according to the rules of propriety,' they say. Are gems and silk all 
<A NAME="240"></A>that is meant by propriety? 'It is music,' they say.-'It is music,' they 
<A NAME="241"></A>say. Are hers and drums all that is meant by music?"
<A NAME="242"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "He who puts on an appearance of stern firmness, 
<A NAME="243"></A>while inwardly he is weak, is like one of the small, mean people;-yea, 
<A NAME="244"></A>is he not like the thief who breaks through, or climbs over, a 
<A NAME="245"></A>wall?"
<A NAME="246"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Your good, careful people of the villages are 
<A NAME="247"></A>the thieves of virtue."
<A NAME="248"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, To tell, as we go along, what we have heard on 
<A NAME="249"></A>the way, is to cast away our virtue."
<A NAME="250"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "There are those mean creatures! How impossible 
<A NAME="251"></A>it is along with them to serve one's prince!
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR>"While they have not got their aims, their anxiety is how to get 
<A NAME="253"></A>them. When they have got them, their anxiety is lest they should lose 
<A NAME="254"></A>them.
<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR>"When they are anxious lest such things should be lost, there is 
<A NAME="256"></A>nothing to which they will not proceed."
<A NAME="257"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Anciently, men had three failings, which now 
<A NAME="258"></A>perhaps are not to be found.
<A NAME="259"></A><BR><BR>"The high-mindedness of antiquity showed itself in a disregard 
<A NAME="260"></A>of small things; the high-mindedness of the present day shows itself in 
<A NAME="261"></A>wild license. The stern dignity of antiquity showed itself in grave reserve; 
<A NAME="262"></A>the stern dignity of the present day shows itself in quarrelsome perverseness. 
<A NAME="263"></A>The stupidity of antiquity showed itself in straightforwardness; the stupidity 
<A NAME="264"></A>of the present day shows itself in sheer deceit."
<A NAME="265"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Fine words and an insinuating appearance are 
<A NAME="266"></A>seldom associated with virtue."
<A NAME="267"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "I hate the manner in which purple takes away 
<A NAME="268"></A>the luster of vermilion. I hate the way in which the songs of Chang confound 
<A NAME="269"></A>the music of the Ya. I hate those who with their sharp mouths overthrow 
<A NAME="270"></A>kingdoms and families."
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "I would prefer not speaking."
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>Tsze-kung said, "If you, Master, do not speak, what shall we, your 
<A NAME="273"></A>disciples, have to record?"
<A NAME="274"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Does Heaven speak? The four seasons pursue their 
<A NAME="275"></A>courses, and all things are continually being produced, but does Heaven 
<A NAME="276"></A>say anything?"
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR>Zu Pei wished to see Confucius, but Confucius declined, on the 
<A NAME="278"></A>ground of being sick, to see him. When the bearer of this message went 
<A NAME="279"></A>out at the door, the Master took his lute and sang to it, in order that 
<A NAME="280"></A>Pei might hear him.
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR>Tsai Wo asked about the three years' mourning for parents, saying 
<A NAME="282"></A>that one year was long enough.
<A NAME="283"></A><BR><BR>"If the superior man," said he, "abstains for three years from 
<A NAME="284"></A>the observances of propriety, those observances will be quite lost. If 
<A NAME="285"></A>for three years he abstains from music, music will be ruined. Within a 
<A NAME="286"></A>year the old grain is exhausted, and the new grain has sprung up, and, 
<A NAME="287"></A>in procuring fire by friction, we go through all the changes of wood for 
<A NAME="288"></A>that purpose. After a complete year, the mourning may 
<A NAME="289"></A>stop."
<A NAME="290"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "If you were, after a year, to eat good rice, 
<A NAME="291"></A>and wear embroidered clothes, would you feel at ease?" "I should," replied 
<A NAME="292"></A>Wo.
<A NAME="293"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "If you can feel at ease, do it. But a superior 
<A NAME="294"></A>man, during the whole period of mourning, does not enjoy pleasant food 
<A NAME="295"></A>which he may eat, nor derive pleasure from music which he may hear. He 
<A NAME="296"></A>also does not feel at ease, if he is comfortably lodged. Therefore he does 
<A NAME="297"></A>not do what you propose. But now you feel at ease and may do 
<A NAME="298"></A>it."
<A NAME="299"></A><BR><BR>Tsai Wo then went out, and the Master said, "This shows Yu's want 
<A NAME="300"></A>of virtue. It is not till a child is three years old that it is allowed 
<A NAME="301"></A>to leave the arms of its parents. And the three years' mourning is universally 
<A NAME="302"></A>observed throughout the empire. Did Yu enjoy the three years' love of his 
<A NAME="303"></A>parents?"
<A NAME="304"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Hard is it to deal with who will stuff himself 
<A NAME="305"></A>with food the whole day, without applying his mind to anything good! Are 
<A NAME="306"></A>there not gamesters and chess players? To be one of these would still be 
<A NAME="307"></A>better than doing nothing at all."
<A NAME="308"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-lu said, "Does the superior man esteem valor?" The Master 
<A NAME="309"></A>said, "The superior man holds righteousness to be of highest importance. 
<A NAME="310"></A>A man in a superior situation, having valor without righteousness, will 
<A NAME="311"></A>be guilty of insubordination; one of the lower people having valor without 
<A NAME="312"></A>righteousness, will commit robbery."
<A NAME="313"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-kung said, "Has the superior man his hatreds also?" The Master 
<A NAME="314"></A>said, "He has his hatreds. He hates those who proclaim the evil of others. 
<A NAME="315"></A>He hates the man who, being in a low station, slanders his superiors. He 
<A NAME="316"></A>hates those who have valor merely, and are unobservant of propriety. He 
<A NAME="317"></A>hates those who are forward and determined, and, at the same time, of contracted 
<A NAME="318"></A>understanding."
<A NAME="319"></A><BR><BR>The Master then inquired, "Ts'ze, have you also your hatreds?" 
<A NAME="320"></A>Tsze-kung replied, "I hate those who pry out matters, and ascribe the knowledge 
<A NAME="321"></A>to their wisdom. I hate those who are only not modest, and think that they 
<A NAME="322"></A>are valorous. I hate those who make known secrets, and think that they 
<A NAME="323"></A>are straightforward."
<A NAME="324"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Of all people, girls and servants are the most 
<A NAME="325"></A>difficult to behave to. If you are familiar with them, they lose their 
<A NAME="326"></A>humility. If you maintain a reserve towards them, they are 
<A NAME="327"></A>discontented."
<A NAME="328"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "When a man at forty is the object of dislike, 
<A NAME="329"></A>he will always continue what he is."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="330"></A><B>Part 18</B>

<A NAME="331"></A><BR><BR>The Viscount of Wei withdrew from the court. The Viscount of Chi 
<A NAME="332"></A>became a slave to Chau. Pi-kan remonstrated with him and 
<A NAME="333"></A>died.
<A NAME="334"></A><BR><BR>Confucius said, "The Yin dynasty possessed these three men of 
<A NAME="335"></A>virtue."
<A NAME="336"></A><BR><BR>Hui of Liu-hsia, being chief criminal judge, was thrice dismissed 
<A NAME="337"></A>from his office. Some one said to him, "Is it not yet time for you, sir, 
<A NAME="338"></A>to leave this?" He replied, "Serving men in an upright way, where shall 
<A NAME="339"></A>I go to, and not experience such a thrice-repeated dismissal? If I choose 
<A NAME="340"></A>to serve men in a crooked way, what necessity is there for me to leave 
<A NAME="341"></A>the country of my parents?"
<A NAME="342"></A><BR><BR>The duke Ching of Ch'i, with reference to the manner in which he 
<A NAME="343"></A>should treat Confucius, said, "I cannot treat him as I would the chief 
<A NAME="344"></A>of the Chi family. I will treat him in a manner between that accorded to 
<A NAME="345"></A>the chief of the Chil and that given to the chief of the Mang family." 
<A NAME="346"></A>He also said, "I am old; I cannot use his doctrines." Confucius took his 
<A NAME="347"></A>departure.
<A NAME="348"></A><BR><BR>The people of Ch'i sent to Lu a present of female musicians, which 
<A NAME="349"></A>Chi Hwan received, and for three days no court was held. Confucius took 
<A NAME="350"></A>his departure.
<A NAME="351"></A><BR><BR>The madman of Ch'u, Chieh-yu, passed by Confucius, singing and 
<A NAME="352"></A>saying, "O FANG! O FANG! How is your virtue degenerated! As to the past, 
<A NAME="353"></A>reproof is useless; but the future may still be provided against. Give 
<A NAME="354"></A>up your vain pursuit. Give up your vain pursuit. Peril awaits those who 
<A NAME="355"></A>now engage in affairs of government."
<A NAME="356"></A><BR><BR>Confucius alighted and wished to converse with him, but Chieh-yu 
<A NAME="357"></A>hastened away, so that he could not talk with him.
<A NAME="358"></A><BR><BR>Ch'ang-tsu and Chieh-ni were at work in the field together, when 
<A NAME="359"></A>Confucius passed by them, and sent Tsze-lu to inquire for the 
<A NAME="360"></A>ford.
<A NAME="361"></A><BR><BR>Ch'ang-tsu said, "Who is he that holds the reins in the carriage 
<A NAME="362"></A>there?" Tsze-lu told him, "It is K'ung Ch'iu.', "Is it not K'ung of Lu?" 
<A NAME="363"></A>asked he. "Yes," was the reply, to which the other rejoined, "He knows 
<A NAME="364"></A>the ford."
<A NAME="365"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-lu then inquired of Chieh-ni, who said to him, "Who are you, 
<A NAME="366"></A>sir?" He answered, "I am Chung Yu." "Are you not the disciple of K'ung 
<A NAME="367"></A>Ch'iu of Lu?" asked the other. "I am," replied he, and then Chieh-ni said 
<A NAME="368"></A>to him, "Disorder, like a swelling flood, spreads over the whole empire, 
<A NAME="369"></A>and who is he that will change its state for you? Rather than follow one 
<A NAME="370"></A>who merely withdraws from this one and that one, had you not better follow 
<A NAME="371"></A>those who have withdrawn from the world altogether?" With this he fell 
<A NAME="372"></A>to covering up the seed, and proceeded with his work, without 
<A NAME="373"></A>stopping.
<A NAME="374"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-lu went and reported their remarks, when the Master observed 
<A NAME="375"></A>with a sigh, "It is impossible to associate with birds and beasts, as if 
<A NAME="376"></A>they were the same with us. If I associate not with these people,-with 
<A NAME="377"></A>mankind,-with whom shall I associate? If right principles prevailed through 
<A NAME="378"></A>the empire, there would be no use for me to change its 
<A NAME="379"></A>state."
<A NAME="380"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-lu, following the Master, happened to fall behind, when he 
<A NAME="381"></A>met an old man, carrying across his shoulder on a staff a basket for weeds. 
<A NAME="382"></A>Tsze-lu said to him, "Have you seen my master, sir?" The old man replied, 
<A NAME="383"></A>"Your four limbs are unaccustomed to toil; you cannot distinguish the five 
<A NAME="384"></A>kinds of grain:-who is your master?" With this, he planted his staff in 
<A NAME="385"></A>the ground, and proceeded to weed.
<A NAME="386"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-lu joined his hands across his breast, and stood before 
<A NAME="387"></A>him.
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>The old man kept Tsze-lu to pass the night in his house, killed a fowl, 
<A NAME="389"></A>prepared millet, and feasted him. He also introduced to him his two 
<A NAME="390"></A>sons.
<A NAME="391"></A><BR><BR>Next day, Tsze-lu went on his way, and reported his adventure. 
<A NAME="392"></A>The Master said, "He is a recluse," and sent Tsze-lu back to see him again, 
<A NAME="393"></A>but when he got to the place, the old man was gone.
<A NAME="394"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-lu then said to the family, "Not to take office is not righteous. 
<A NAME="395"></A>If the relations between old and young may not be neglected, how is it 
<A NAME="396"></A>that he sets aside the duties that should be observed between sovereign 
<A NAME="397"></A>and minister? Wishing to maintain his personal purity, he allows that great 
<A NAME="398"></A>relation to come to confusion. A superior man takes office, and performs 
<A NAME="399"></A>the righteous duties belonging to it. As to the failure of right principles 
<A NAME="400"></A>to make progress, he is aware of that."
<A NAME="401"></A><BR><BR>The men who have retired to privacy from the world have been Po-i, 
<A NAME="402"></A>Shu-ch'i, Yuchung, I-yi, Chu-chang, Hui of Liu-hsia, and 
<A NAME="403"></A>Shao-lien.
<A NAME="404"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Refusing to surrender their wills, or to submit 
<A NAME="405"></A>to any taint in their persons; such, I think, were Po-i and 
<A NAME="406"></A>Shu-ch'i.
<A NAME="407"></A><BR><BR>"It may be said of Hui of Liu-hsia! and of Shaolien, that they 
<A NAME="408"></A>surrendered their wills, and submitted to taint in their persons, but their 
<A NAME="409"></A>words corresponded with reason, and their actions were such as men are 
<A NAME="410"></A>anxious to see. This is all that is to be remarked in 
<A NAME="411"></A>them.
<A NAME="412"></A><BR><BR>"It may be said of Yu-chung and I-yi, that, while they hid themselves 
<A NAME="413"></A>in their seclusion, they gave a license to their words; but in their persons, 
<A NAME="414"></A>they succeeded in preserving their purity, and, in their retirement, they 
<A NAME="415"></A>acted according to the exigency of the times.
<A NAME="416"></A><BR><BR>"I am different from all these. I have no course for which I am 
<A NAME="417"></A>predetermined, and no course against which I am predetermined."
<A NAME="418"></A><BR><BR>The grand music master, Chih, went to Ch'i.
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>Kan, the master of the band at the second meal, went to Ch'u. Liao, 
<A NAME="420"></A>the band master at the third meal, went to Ts'ai. Chueh, the band master 
<A NAME="421"></A>at the fourth meal, went to Ch'in.
<A NAME="422"></A><BR><BR>Fang-shu, the drum master, withdrew to the north of the 
<A NAME="423"></A>river.
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>Wu, the master of the hand drum, withdrew to the 
<A NAME="425"></A>Han.
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>Yang, the assistant music master, and Hsiang, master of the musical 
<A NAME="427"></A>stone, withdrew to an island in the sea.
<A NAME="428"></A><BR><BR>The duke of Chau addressed his son, the duke of Lu, saying, "The 
<A NAME="429"></A>virtuous prince does not neglect his relations. He does not cause the great 
<A NAME="430"></A>ministers to repine at his not employing them. Without some great cause, 
<A NAME="431"></A>he does not dismiss from their offices the members of old families. He 
<A NAME="432"></A>does not seek in one man talents for every employment."
<A NAME="433"></A><BR><BR>To Chau belonged the eight officers, Po-ta, Po-kwo, Chung-tu, Chung-hwu, 
<A NAME="434"></A>Shu-ya, Shuhsia, Chi-sui, and Chi-kwa.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="435"></A><B>Part 19</B>

<A NAME="436"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-chang said, "The scholar, trained for public duty, seeing 
<A NAME="437"></A>threatening danger, is prepared to sacrifice his life. When the opportunity 
<A NAME="438"></A>of gain is presented to him, he thinks of righteousness. In sacrificing, 
<A NAME="439"></A>his thoughts are reverential. In mourning, his thoughts are about the grief 
<A NAME="440"></A>which he should feel. Such a man commands our approbation 
<A NAME="441"></A>indeed
<A NAME="442"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-chang said, "When a man holds fast to virtue, but without 
<A NAME="443"></A>seeking to enlarge it, and believes in right principles, but without firm 
<A NAME="444"></A>sincerity, what account can be made of his existence or 
<A NAME="445"></A>non-existence?"
<A NAME="446"></A><BR><BR>The disciples of Tsze-hsia asked Tsze-chang about the principles 
<A NAME="447"></A>that should characterize mutual intercourse. Tsze-chang asked, "What does 
<A NAME="448"></A>Tsze-hsia say on the subject?" They replied, "Tsze-hsia says: 'Associate 
<A NAME="449"></A>with those who can advantage you. Put away from you those who cannot do 
<A NAME="450"></A>so.'" Tsze-chang observed, "This is different from what I have learned. 
<A NAME="451"></A>The superior man honors the talented and virtuous, and bears with all. 
<A NAME="452"></A>He praises the good, and pities the incompetent. Am I possessed of great 
<A NAME="453"></A>talents and virtue?-who is there among men whom I will not bear with? Am 
<A NAME="454"></A>I devoid of talents and virtue?-men will put me away from them. What have 
<A NAME="455"></A>we to do with the putting away of others?"
<A NAME="456"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-hsia said, "Even in inferior studies and employments there 
<A NAME="457"></A>is something worth being looked at; but if it be attempted to carry them 
<A NAME="458"></A>out to what is remote, there is a danger of their proving inapplicable. 
<A NAME="459"></A>Therefore, the superior man does not practice them."
<A NAME="460"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-hsia said, "He, who from day to day recognizes what he has 
<A NAME="461"></A>not yet, and from month to month does not forget what he has attained to, 
<A NAME="462"></A>may be said indeed to love to learn."
<A NAME="463"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-hsia said, "There are learning extensively, and having a firm 
<A NAME="464"></A>and sincere aim; inquiring with earnestness, and reflecting with self-application:-virtue 
<A NAME="465"></A>is in such a course."
<A NAME="466"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-hsia said, "Mechanics have their shops to dwell in, in order 
<A NAME="467"></A>to accomplish their works. The superior man learns, in order to reach to 
<A NAME="468"></A>the utmost of his principles."
<A NAME="469"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-hsia said, "The mean man is sure to gloss his 
<A NAME="470"></A>faults."
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>Tsze-hsia said, "The superior man undergoes three changes. Looked at 
<A NAME="472"></A>from a distance, he appears stern; when approached, he is mild; when he 
<A NAME="473"></A>is heard to speak, his language is firm and decided."
<A NAME="474"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-hsia said, "The superior man, having obtained their confidence, 
<A NAME="475"></A>may then impose labors on his people. If he have not gained their confidence, 
<A NAME="476"></A>they will think that he is oppressing them. Having obtained the confidence 
<A NAME="477"></A>of his prince, one may then remonstrate with him. If he have not gained 
<A NAME="478"></A>his confidence, the prince will think that he is vilifying 
<A NAME="479"></A>him."
<A NAME="480"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-hsia said, "When a person does not transgress the boundary 
<A NAME="481"></A>line in the great virtues, he may pass and repass it in the small 
<A NAME="482"></A>virtues."
<A NAME="483"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-yu said, "The disciples and followers of Tsze-hsia, in sprinkling 
<A NAME="484"></A>and sweeping the ground, in answering and replying, in advancing and receding, 
<A NAME="485"></A>are sufficiently accomplished. But these are only the branches of learning, 
<A NAME="486"></A>and they are left ignorant of what is essential.-How can they be acknowledged 
<A NAME="487"></A>as sufficiently taught?"
<A NAME="488"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-hsia heard of the remark and said, "Alas! Yen Yu is wrong. 
<A NAME="489"></A>According to the way of the superior man in teaching, what departments 
<A NAME="490"></A>are there which he considers of prime importance, and delivers? what are 
<A NAME="491"></A>there which he considers of secondary importance, and allows himself to 
<A NAME="492"></A>be idle about? But as in the case of plants, which are assorted according 
<A NAME="493"></A>to their classes, so he deals with his disciples. How can the way of a 
<A NAME="494"></A>superior man be such as to make fools of any of them? Is it not the sage 
<A NAME="495"></A>alone, who can unite in one the beginning and the consummation of 
<A NAME="496"></A>learning?"
<A NAME="497"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-hsia said, "The officer, having discharged all his duties, 
<A NAME="498"></A>should devote his leisure to learning. The student, having completed his 
<A NAME="499"></A>learning, should apply himself to be an officer."
<A NAME="500"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-hsia said, "Mourning, having been carried to the utmost degree 
<A NAME="501"></A>of grief, should stop with that."
<A NAME="502"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-hsia said, "My friend Chang can do things which are hard to 
<A NAME="503"></A>be done, but yet he is not perfectly virtuous."
<A NAME="504"></A><BR><BR>The philosopher Tsang said, "How imposing is the manner of Chang! 
<A NAME="505"></A>It is difficult along with him to practice virtue."
<A NAME="506"></A><BR><BR>The philosopher Tsang said, "I heard this from our Master: 'Men 
<A NAME="507"></A>may not have shown what is in them to the full extent, and yet they will 
<A NAME="508"></A>be found to do so, on the occasion of mourning for their 
<A NAME="509"></A>parents."
<A NAME="510"></A><BR><BR>The philosopher Tsang said, "I have heard this from our Master:-'The 
<A NAME="511"></A>filial piety of Mang Chwang, in other matters, was what other men are competent 
<A NAME="512"></A>to, but, as seen in his not changing the ministers of his father, nor his 
<A NAME="513"></A>father's mode of government, it is difficult to be attained 
<A NAME="514"></A>to.'"
<A NAME="515"></A><BR><BR>The chief of the Mang family having appointed Yang Fu to be chief 
<A NAME="516"></A>criminal judge, the latter consulted the philosopher Tsang. Tsang said, 
<A NAME="517"></A>"The rulers have failed in their duties, and the people consequently have 
<A NAME="518"></A>been disorganized for a long time. When you have found out the truth of 
<A NAME="519"></A>any accusation, be grieved for and pity them, and do not feel joy at your 
<A NAME="520"></A>own ability."
<A NAME="521"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-kung said, "Chau's wickedness was not so great as that name 
<A NAME="522"></A>implies. Therefore, the superior man hates to dwell in a low-lying situation, 
<A NAME="523"></A>where all the evil of the world will flow in upon him."
<A NAME="524"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-kung said, "The faults of the superior man are like the eclipses 
<A NAME="525"></A>of the sun and moon. He has his faults, and all men see them; he changes 
<A NAME="526"></A>again, and all men look up to him."
<A NAME="527"></A><BR><BR>Kung-sun Ch'ao of Wei asked Tszekung, saying. "From whom did Chung-ni 
<A NAME="528"></A>get his learning?"
<A NAME="529"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-kung replied, "The doctrines of Wan and Wu have not yet fallen 
<A NAME="530"></A>to the ground. They are to be found among men. Men of talents and virtue 
<A NAME="531"></A>remember the greater principles of them, and others, not possessing such 
<A NAME="532"></A>talents and virtue, remember the smaller. Thus, all possess the doctrines 
<A NAME="533"></A>of Wan and Wu. Where could our Master go that he should not have an opportunity 
<A NAME="534"></A>of learning them? And yet what necessity was there for his having a regular 
<A NAME="535"></A>master?"
<A NAME="536"></A><BR><BR>Shu-sun Wu-shu observed to the great officers in the court, saying, 
<A NAME="537"></A>"Tsze-kung is superior to Chung-ni."
<A NAME="538"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-fu Ching-po reported the observation to Tsze-kung, who said, 
<A NAME="539"></A>"Let me use the comparison of a house and its encompassing wall. My wall 
<A NAME="540"></A>only reaches to the shoulders. One may peep over it, and see whatever is 
<A NAME="541"></A>valuable in the apartments.
<A NAME="542"></A><BR><BR>"The wall of my Master is several fathoms high. If one do not find 
<A NAME="543"></A>the door and enter by it, he cannot see the ancestral temple with its beauties, 
<A NAME="544"></A>nor all the officers in their rich array.
<A NAME="545"></A><BR><BR>"But I may assume that they are few who find the door. Was not 
<A NAME="546"></A>the observation of the chief only what might have been 
<A NAME="547"></A>expected?"
<A NAME="548"></A><BR><BR>Shu-sun Wu-shu having spoken revilingly of Chung-ni, Tsze-kung 
<A NAME="549"></A>said, "It is of no use doing so. Chung-ni cannot be reviled. The talents 
<A NAME="550"></A>and virtue of other men are hillocks and mounds which may be stepped over. 
<A NAME="551"></A>Chung-ni is the sun or moon, which it is not possible to step over. Although 
<A NAME="552"></A>a man may wish to cut himself off from the sage, what harm can he do to 
<A NAME="553"></A>the sun or moon? He only shows that he does not know his own 
<A NAME="554"></A>capacity.
<A NAME="555"></A><BR><BR>Ch'an Tsze-ch' in, addressing Tsze-kung, said, "You are too modest. 
<A NAME="556"></A>How can Chung-ni be said to be superior to you?"
<A NAME="557"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-kung said to him, "For one word a man is often deemed to be 
<A NAME="558"></A>wise, and for one word he is often deemed to be foolish. We ought to be 
<A NAME="559"></A>careful indeed in what we say.
<A NAME="560"></A><BR><BR>"Our Master cannot be attained to, just in the same way as the 
<A NAME="561"></A>heavens cannot be gone up by the steps of a stair.
<A NAME="562"></A><BR><BR>"Were our Master in the position of the ruler of a state or the 
<A NAME="563"></A>chief of a family, we should find verified the description which has been 
<A NAME="564"></A>given of a sage's rule:-he would plant the people, and forthwith they would 
<A NAME="565"></A>be established; he would lead them on, and forthwith they would follow 
<A NAME="566"></A>him; he would make them happy, and forthwith multitudes would resort to 
<A NAME="567"></A>his dominions; he would stimulate them, and forthwith they would be harmonious. 
<A NAME="568"></A>While he lived, he would be glorious. When he died, he would be bitterly 
<A NAME="569"></A>lamented. How is it possible for him to be attained 
<A NAME="570"></A>to?"
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="571"></A><B>Part 20</B>

<A NAME="572"></A><BR><BR>Yao said, "Oh! you, Shun, the Heaven-determined order of succession 
<A NAME="573"></A>now rests in your person. Sincerely hold fast the due Mean. If there shall 
<A NAME="574"></A>be distress and want within the four seas, the Heavenly revenue will come 
<A NAME="575"></A>to a perpetual end."
<A NAME="576"></A><BR><BR>Shun also used the same language in giving charge to 
<A NAME="577"></A>Yu.
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>T'ang said, "I the child Li, presume to use a dark-colored victim, 
<A NAME="579"></A>and presume to announce to Thee, O most great and sovereign God, that the 
<A NAME="580"></A>sinner I dare not pardon, and thy ministers, O God, I do not keep in obscurity. 
<A NAME="581"></A>The examination of them is by thy mind, O God. If, in my person, I commit 
<A NAME="582"></A>offenses, they are not to be attributed to you, the people of the myriad 
<A NAME="583"></A>regions. If you in the myriad regions commit offenses, these offenses must 
<A NAME="584"></A>rest on my person."
<A NAME="585"></A><BR><BR>Chau conferred great gifts, and the good were 
<A NAME="586"></A>enriched.
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>"Although he has his near relatives, they are not equal to my virtuous 
<A NAME="588"></A>men. The people are throwing blame upon me, the One 
<A NAME="589"></A>man."
<A NAME="590"></A><BR><BR>He carefully attended to the weights and measures, examined the 
<A NAME="591"></A>body of the laws, restored the discarded officers, and the good government 
<A NAME="592"></A>of the kingdom took its course.
<A NAME="593"></A><BR><BR>He revived states that had been extinguished, restored families 
<A NAME="594"></A>whose line of succession had been broken, and called to office those who 
<A NAME="595"></A>had retired into obscurity, so that throughout the kingdom the hearts of 
<A NAME="596"></A>the people turned towards him.
<A NAME="597"></A><BR><BR>What he attached chief importance to were the food of the people, 
<A NAME="598"></A>the duties of mourning, and sacrifices.
<A NAME="599"></A><BR><BR>By his generosity, he won all. By his sincerity, he made the people 
<A NAME="600"></A>repose trust in him. By his earnest activity, his achievements were great. 
<A NAME="601"></A>By his justice, all were delighted.
<A NAME="602"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-chang asked Confucius, saying, "In what way should a person 
<A NAME="603"></A>in authority act in order that he may conduct government properly?" The 
<A NAME="604"></A>Master replied, "Let him honor the five excellent, and banish away the 
<A NAME="605"></A>four bad, things;-then may he conduct government properly." Tsze-chang 
<A NAME="606"></A>said, "What are meant by the five excellent things?" The Master said, "When 
<A NAME="607"></A>the person in authority is beneficent without great expenditure; when he 
<A NAME="608"></A>lays tasks on the people without their repining; when he pursues what he 
<A NAME="609"></A>desires without being covetous; when he maintains a dignified ease without 
<A NAME="610"></A>being proud; when he is majestic without being fierce."
<A NAME="611"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-chang said, "What is meant by being beneficent without great 
<A NAME="612"></A>expenditure?" The Master replied, "When the person in authority makes more 
<A NAME="613"></A>beneficial to the people the things from which they naturally derive benefit;-is 
<A NAME="614"></A>not this being beneficent without great expenditure? When he chooses the 
<A NAME="615"></A>labors which are proper, and makes them labor on them, who will repine? 
<A NAME="616"></A>When his desires are set on benevolent government, and he secures it, who 
<A NAME="617"></A>will accuse him of covetousness? Whether he has to do with many people 
<A NAME="618"></A>or few, or with things great or small, he does not dare to indicate any 
<A NAME="619"></A>disrespect;-is not this to maintain a dignified ease without any pride? 
<A NAME="620"></A>He adjusts his clothes and cap, and throws a dignity into his looks, so 
<A NAME="621"></A>that, thus dignified, he is looked at with awe;-is not this to be majestic 
<A NAME="622"></A>without being fierce?"
<A NAME="623"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-chang then asked, "What are meant by the four bad things?" 
<A NAME="624"></A>The Master said, "To put the people to death without having instructed 
<A NAME="625"></A>them;-this is called cruelty. To require from them, suddenly, the full 
<A NAME="626"></A>tale of work, without having given them warning;-this is called oppression. 
<A NAME="627"></A>To issue orders as if without urgency, at first, and, when the time comes, 
<A NAME="628"></A>to insist on them with severity;-this is called injury. And, generally, 
<A NAME="629"></A>in the giving pay or rewards to men, to do it in a stingy way;-this is 
<A NAME="630"></A>called acting the part of a mere official."
<A NAME="631"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Without recognizing the ordinances of Heaven, 
<A NAME="632"></A>it is impossible to be a superior man.
<A NAME="633"></A><BR><BR>"Without an acquaintance with the rules of Propriety, it is impossible 
<A NAME="634"></A>for the character to be established.
<A NAME="635"></A><BR><BR>"Without knowing the force of words, it is impossible to know 
<A NAME="636"></A>men."
