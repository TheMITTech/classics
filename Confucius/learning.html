<A NAME="2"></A><BR><BR>By Confucius
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written ca. 500 B.C.E</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>What the great learning teaches, is to illustrate illustrious virtue; to 
<A NAME="11"></A>renovate the people; and to rest in the highest excellence.
<A NAME="12"></A><BR><BR>The point where to rest being known, the object of pursuit is then 
<A NAME="13"></A>determined; and, that being determined, a calm unperturbedness may be attained 
<A NAME="14"></A>to. To that calmness there will succeed a tranquil repose. In that repose 
<A NAME="15"></A>there may be careful deliberation, and that deliberation will be followed 
<A NAME="16"></A>by the attainment of the desired end.
<A NAME="17"></A><BR><BR>Things have their root and their branches. Affairs have their end 
<A NAME="18"></A>and their beginning. To know what is first and what is last will lead near 
<A NAME="19"></A>to what is taught in the Great Learning.
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><BR>The ancients who wished to illustrate illustrious virtue throughout 
<A NAME="21"></A>the kingdom, first ordered well their own states. Wishing to order well 
<A NAME="22"></A>their states, they first regulated their families. Wishing to regulate 
<A NAME="23"></A>their families, they first cultivated their persons. Wishing to cultivate 
<A NAME="24"></A>their persons, they first rectified their hearts. Wishing to rectify their 
<A NAME="25"></A>hearts, they first sought to be sincere in their thoughts. Wishing to be 
<A NAME="26"></A>sincere in their thoughts, they first extended to the utmost their knowledge. 
<A NAME="27"></A>Such extension of knowledge lay in the investigation of 
<A NAME="28"></A>things.
<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR>Things being investigated, knowledge became complete. Their knowledge 
<A NAME="30"></A>being complete, their thoughts were sincere. Their thoughts being sincere, 
<A NAME="31"></A>their hearts were then rectified. Their hearts being rectified, their persons 
<A NAME="32"></A>were cultivated. Their persons being cultivated, their families were regulated. 
<A NAME="33"></A>Their families being regulated, their states were rightly governed. Their 
<A NAME="34"></A>states being rightly governed, the whole kingdom was made tranquil and 
<A NAME="35"></A>happy.
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR>From the Son of Heaven down to the mass of the people, all must 
<A NAME="37"></A>consider the cultivation of the person the root of everything 
<A NAME="38"></A>besides.
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR>It cannot be, when the root is neglected, that what should spring 
<A NAME="40"></A>from it will be well ordered. It never has been the case that what was 
<A NAME="41"></A>of great importance has been slightly cared for, and, at the same time, 
<A NAME="42"></A>that what was of slight importance has been greatly cared 
<A NAME="43"></A>for.
<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR><B>Commentary of the philosopher Tsang</B>

<A NAME="45"></A><BR><BR>In the Announcement to K'ang, it is said, "He was able to make 
<A NAME="46"></A>his virtue illustrious."
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR>In the Tai Chia, it is said, "He contemplated and studied the illustrious 
<A NAME="48"></A>decrees of Heaven."
<A NAME="49"></A><BR><BR>In the Canon of the emperor (Yao), it is said, "He was able to 
<A NAME="50"></A>make illustrious his lofty virtue."
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR>These passages all show how those sovereigns made themselves 
<A NAME="52"></A>illustrious.
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR>On the bathing tub of T'ang, the following words were engraved: 
<A NAME="54"></A>"If you can one day renovate yourself, do so from day to day. Yea, let 
<A NAME="55"></A>there be daily renovation."
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR>In the Announcement to K'ang, it is said, "To stir up the new 
<A NAME="57"></A>people."
<A NAME="58"></A><BR><BR>In the Book of Poetry, it is said, "Although Chau was an ancient 
<A NAME="59"></A>state the ordinance which lighted on it was new."
<A NAME="60"></A><BR><BR>Therefore, the superior man in everything uses his utmost 
<A NAME="61"></A>endeavors.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>In the Book of Poetry, it is said, "The royal domain of a thousand 
<A NAME="63"></A>li is where the people rest."
<A NAME="64"></A><BR><BR>In the Book of Poetry, it is said, "The twittering yellow bird 
<A NAME="65"></A>rests on a corner of the mound." The Master said, "When it rests, it knows 
<A NAME="66"></A>where to rest. Is it possible that a man should not be equal to this 
<A NAME="67"></A>bird?"
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR>In the Book of Poetry, it is said, "Profound was King Wan. With 
<A NAME="69"></A>how bright and unceasing a feeling of reverence did he regard his resting 
<A NAME="70"></A>places!" As a sovereign, he rested in benevolence. As a minister, he rested 
<A NAME="71"></A>in reverence. As a son, he rested in filial piety. As a father, he rested 
<A NAME="72"></A>in kindness. In communication with his subjects, he rested in good 
<A NAME="73"></A>faith.
<A NAME="74"></A><BR><BR>In the Book of Poetry, it is said, "Look at that winding course 
<A NAME="75"></A>of the Ch'i, with the green bamboos so luxuriant! Here is our elegant and 
<A NAME="76"></A>accomplished prince! As we cut and then file; as we chisel and then grind: 
<A NAME="77"></A>so has he cultivated himself. How grave is he and dignified! How majestic 
<A NAME="78"></A>and distinguished! Our elegant and accomplished prince never can be forgotten." 
<A NAME="79"></A>That expression-"As we cut and then file," the work of learning. "As we 
<A NAME="80"></A>chisel and then grind," indicates that of self-culture. "How grave is he 
<A NAME="81"></A>and dignified!" indicates the feeling of cautious reverence. "How commanding 
<A NAME="82"></A>and distinguished! indicates an awe-inspiring deportment. "Our elegant 
<A NAME="83"></A>and accomplished prince never can be forgotten," indicates how, when virtue 
<A NAME="84"></A>is complete and excellence extreme, the people cannot forget 
<A NAME="85"></A>them.
<A NAME="86"></A><BR><BR>In the Book of Poetry, it is said, "Ah! the former kings are not 
<A NAME="87"></A>forgotten." Future princes deem worthy what they deemed worthy, and love 
<A NAME="88"></A>what they loved. The common people delight in what delighted them, and 
<A NAME="89"></A>are benefited by their beneficial arrangements. It is on this account that 
<A NAME="90"></A>the former kings, after they have quitted the world, are not 
<A NAME="91"></A>forgotten.
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "In hearing litigations, I am like any other body. 
<A NAME="93"></A>What is necessary is to cause the people to have no litigations." So, those 
<A NAME="94"></A>who are devoid of principle find it impossible to carry out their speeches, 
<A NAME="95"></A>and a great awe would be struck into men's minds;-this is called knowing 
<A NAME="96"></A>the root.
<A NAME="97"></A><BR><BR>This is called knowing the root. This is called the perfecting 
<A NAME="98"></A>of knowledge.
<A NAME="99"></A><BR><BR>What is meant by "making the thoughts sincere." is the allowing 
<A NAME="100"></A>no self-deception, as when we hate a bad smell, and as when we love what 
<A NAME="101"></A>is beautiful. This is called self-enjoyment. Therefore, the superior man 
<A NAME="102"></A>must be watchful over himself when he is alone.
<A NAME="103"></A><BR><BR>There is no evil to which the mean man, dwelling retired, will 
<A NAME="104"></A>not proceed, but when he sees a superior man, he instantly tries to disguise 
<A NAME="105"></A>himself, concealing his evil, and displaying what is good. The other beholds 
<A NAME="106"></A>him, as if he saw his heart and reins;-of what use is his disguise? This 
<A NAME="107"></A>is an instance of the saying -"What truly is within will be manifested 
<A NAME="108"></A>without." Therefore, the superior man must be watchful over himself when 
<A NAME="109"></A>he is alone.
<A NAME="110"></A><BR><BR>The disciple Tsang said, "What ten eyes behold, what ten hands 
<A NAME="111"></A>point to, is to be regarded with reverence!"
<A NAME="112"></A><BR><BR>Riches adorn a house, and virtue adorns the person. The mind is 
<A NAME="113"></A>expanded, and the body is at ease. Therefore, the superior man must make 
<A NAME="114"></A>his thoughts sincere.
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR>What is meant by, "The cultivation of the person depends on rectifying 
<A NAME="116"></A>the mind may be thus illustrated:-If a man be under the influence of passion 
<A NAME="117"></A>he will be incorrect in his conduct. He will be the same, if he is under 
<A NAME="118"></A>the influence of terror, or under the influence of fond regard, or under 
<A NAME="119"></A>that of sorrow and distress.
<A NAME="120"></A><BR><BR>When the mind is not present, we look and do not see; we hear and 
<A NAME="121"></A>do not understand; we eat and do not know the taste of what we 
<A NAME="122"></A>eat.
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>This is what is meant by saying that the cultivation of the person 
<A NAME="124"></A>depends on the rectifying of the mind.
<A NAME="125"></A><BR><BR>What is meant by "The regulation of one's family depends on the 
<A NAME="126"></A>cultivation of his person is this:-men are partial where they feel affection 
<A NAME="127"></A>and love; partial where they despise and dislike; partial where they stand 
<A NAME="128"></A>in awe and reverence; partial where they feel sorrow and compassion; partial 
<A NAME="129"></A>where they are arrogant and rude. Thus it is that there are few men in 
<A NAME="130"></A>the world who love and at the same time know the bad qualities of the object 
<A NAME="131"></A>of their love, or who hate and yet know the excellences of the object of 
<A NAME="132"></A>their hatred.
<A NAME="133"></A><BR><BR>Hence it is said, in the common adage,"A man does not know the 
<A NAME="134"></A>wickedness of his son; he does not know the richness of his growing 
<A NAME="135"></A>corn."
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>This is what is meant by saying that if the person be not cultivated, 
<A NAME="137"></A>a man cannot regulate his family.
<A NAME="138"></A><BR><BR>What is meant by "In order rightly to govern the state, it is necessary 
<A NAME="139"></A>first to regulate the family," is this:-It is not possible for one to teach 
<A NAME="140"></A>others, while he cannot teach his own family. Therefore, the ruler, without 
<A NAME="141"></A>going beyond his family, completes the lessons for the state. There is 
<A NAME="142"></A>filial piety:-therewith the. sovereign should be served. There is fraternal 
<A NAME="143"></A>submission:-therewith elders and superiors should be served. There is kindness:-therewith 
<A NAME="144"></A>the multitude should be treated.
<A NAME="145"></A><BR><BR>In the Announcement to K'ang, it is said, "Act as if you were watching 
<A NAME="146"></A>over an infant." If a mother is really anxious about it, though she may 
<A NAME="147"></A>not hit exactly the wants of her infant, she will not be far from doing 
<A NAME="148"></A>so. There never has been a girl who learned to bring up a child, that she 
<A NAME="149"></A>might afterwards marry.
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR>From the loving example of one family a whole state becomes loving, 
<A NAME="151"></A>and from its courtesies the whole state becomes courteous while, from the 
<A NAME="152"></A>ambition and perverseness of the One man, the whole state may be led to 
<A NAME="153"></A>rebellious disorder;-such is the nature of the influence. This verifies 
<A NAME="154"></A>the saying, "Affairs may be ruined by a single sentence; a kingdom may 
<A NAME="155"></A>be settled by its One man."
<A NAME="156"></A><BR><BR>Yao and Shun led on the kingdom with benevolence and the people 
<A NAME="157"></A>followed them. Chieh and Chau led on the kingdom with violence, and people 
<A NAME="158"></A>followed them. The orders which these issued were contrary to the practices 
<A NAME="159"></A>which they loved, and so the people did not follow them. On this account, 
<A NAME="160"></A>the ruler must himself be possessed of the good qualities, and then he 
<A NAME="161"></A>may require them in the people. He must not have the bad qualities in himself, 
<A NAME="162"></A>and then he may require that they shall not be in the people. Never has 
<A NAME="163"></A>there been a man, who, not having reference to his own character and wishes 
<A NAME="164"></A>in dealing with others, was able effectually to instruct 
<A NAME="165"></A>them.
<A NAME="166"></A><BR><BR>Thus we see how the government of the state depends on the regulation 
<A NAME="167"></A>of the family.
<A NAME="168"></A><BR><BR>In the Book of Poetry, it is said, "That peach tree, so delicate 
<A NAME="169"></A>and elegant! How luxuriant is its foliage! This girl is going to her husband's 
<A NAME="170"></A>house. She will rightly order her household." Let the household be rightly 
<A NAME="171"></A>ordered, and then the people of the state may be taught.
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR>In the Book of Poetry, it is said, "They can discharge their duties 
<A NAME="173"></A>to their elder brothers. They can discharge their duties to their younger 
<A NAME="174"></A>brothers." Let the ruler discharge his duties to his elder and younger 
<A NAME="175"></A>brothers, and then he may teach the people of the state.
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR>In the Book of Poetry, it is said, "In his deportment there is 
<A NAME="177"></A>nothing wrong; he rectifies all the people of the state." Yes; when the 
<A NAME="178"></A>ruler, as a father, a son, and a brother, is a model, then the people imitate 
<A NAME="179"></A>him.
<A NAME="180"></A><BR><BR>This is what is meant by saying, "The government of his kingdom 
<A NAME="181"></A>depends on his regulation of the family."
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>What is meant by "The making the whole kingdom peaceful and happy 
<A NAME="183"></A>depends on the government of his state," this:-When the sovereign behaves 
<A NAME="184"></A>to his aged, as the aged should be behaved to, the people become final; 
<A NAME="185"></A>when the sovereign behaves to his elders, as the elders should be behaved 
<A NAME="186"></A>to, the people learn brotherly submission; when the sovereign treats compassionately 
<A NAME="187"></A>the young and helpless, the people do the same. Thus the ruler has a principle 
<A NAME="188"></A>with which, as with a measuring square, he may regulate his 
<A NAME="189"></A>conduct.
<A NAME="190"></A><BR><BR>What a man dislikes in his superiors, let him not display in the 
<A NAME="191"></A>treatment of his inferiors; what he dislikes in inferiors, let him not 
<A NAME="192"></A>display in the service of his superiors; what he hates in those who are 
<A NAME="193"></A>before him, let him not therewith precede those who are behind him; what 
<A NAME="194"></A>he hates in those who are behind him, let him not bestow on the left; what 
<A NAME="195"></A>he hates to receive on the left, let him not bestow on the right:-this 
<A NAME="196"></A>is what is called "The principle with which, as with a measuring square, 
<A NAME="197"></A>to regulate one's conduct."
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR>In the Book of Poetry, it is said, "How much to be rejoiced in 
<A NAME="199"></A>are these princes, the parents of the people!" When a prince loves what 
<A NAME="200"></A>the people love, and hates what the people hate, then is he what is called 
<A NAME="201"></A>the parent of the people.
<A NAME="202"></A><BR><BR>In the Book of Poetry, it is said, "Lofty is that southern hill, 
<A NAME="203"></A>with its rugged masses of rocks! Greatly distinguished are you, O grand-teacher 
<A NAME="204"></A>Yin, the people all look up to you. "Rulers of states may not neglect to 
<A NAME="205"></A>be careful. If they deviate to a mean selfishness, they will be a disgrace 
<A NAME="206"></A>in the kingdom.
<A NAME="207"></A><BR><BR>In the Book of Poetry, it is said, "Before the sovereigns of the 
<A NAME="208"></A>Yin dynasty had lost the hearts of the people, they could appear before 
<A NAME="209"></A>God. Take warning from the house of Yin. The great decree is not easily 
<A NAME="210"></A>preserved." This shows that, by gaining the people, the kingdom is gained, 
<A NAME="211"></A>and, by losing the people, the kingdom is lost.
<A NAME="212"></A><BR><BR>On this account, the ruler will first take pains about his own 
<A NAME="213"></A>virtue. Possessing virtue will give him the people. Possessing the people 
<A NAME="214"></A>will give the territory. Possessing the territory will give him its wealth. 
<A NAME="215"></A>Possessing the wealth, he will have resources for expenditure.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR><BR>Virtue is the root; wealth is the result.
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>If he make the root his secondary object, and the result his primary, 
<A NAME="218"></A>he will only wrangle with his people, and teach them 
<A NAME="219"></A>rapine.
<A NAME="220"></A><BR><BR>Hence, the accumulation of wealth is the way to scatter the people; 
<A NAME="221"></A>and the letting it be scattered among them is the way to collect the 
<A NAME="222"></A>people.
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR>And hence, the ruler's words going forth contrary to right, will 
<A NAME="224"></A>come back to him in the same way, and wealth, gotten by improper ways, 
<A NAME="225"></A>will take its departure by the same.
<A NAME="226"></A><BR><BR>In the Announcement to K'ang, it is said, "The decree indeed may 
<A NAME="227"></A>not always rest on us"; that is, goodness obtains the decree, and the want 
<A NAME="228"></A>of goodness loses it.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR><BR>In the Book of Ch'u, it is said, "The kingdom of Ch'u does not 
<A NAME="230"></A>consider that to be valuable. It values, instead, its good 
<A NAME="231"></A>men."
<A NAME="232"></A><BR><BR>Duke Wan's uncle, Fan, said, "Our fugitive does not account that 
<A NAME="233"></A>to be precious. What he considers precious is the affection due to his 
<A NAME="234"></A>parent."
<A NAME="235"></A><BR><BR>In the Declaration of the Duke of Ch'in, it is said, "Let me have 
<A NAME="236"></A>but one minister, plain and sincere, not pretending to other abilities, 
<A NAME="237"></A>but with a simple, upright, mind; and possessed of generosity, regarding 
<A NAME="238"></A>the talents of others as though he himself possessed them, and, where he 
<A NAME="239"></A>finds accomplished and perspicacious men, loving them in his heart more 
<A NAME="240"></A>than his mouth expresses, and really showing himself able to bear them 
<A NAME="241"></A>and employ them:-such a minister will be able to preserve my sons and grandsons 
<A NAME="242"></A>and black-haired people, and benefits likewise to the kingdom may well 
<A NAME="243"></A>be looked for from him. But if it be his character, when he finds men of 
<A NAME="244"></A>ability, to be jealous and hate them; and, when he finds accomplished and 
<A NAME="245"></A>perspicacious men, to oppose them and not allow their advancement, showing 
<A NAME="246"></A>himself really not able to bear them: such a minister will not be able 
<A NAME="247"></A>to protect my sons and grandsons and people; and may he not also be pronounced 
<A NAME="248"></A>dangerous to the state?"
<A NAME="249"></A><BR><BR>It is only the truly virtuous man who can send away such a man 
<A NAME="250"></A>and banish him, driving him out among the barbarous tribes around, determined 
<A NAME="251"></A>not to dwell along with him in the Auddle Kingdom. This is in accordance 
<A NAME="252"></A>with the saying, "It is only the truly virtuous man who can love or who 
<A NAME="253"></A>can hate others."
<A NAME="254"></A><BR><BR>To see men of worth and not be able to raise them to office; to 
<A NAME="255"></A>raise them to office, but not to do so quickly:-this is disrespectful. 
<A NAME="256"></A>To see bad men and not be able to remove them; to remove them, but not 
<A NAME="257"></A>to do so to a distance:-this is weakness.
<A NAME="258"></A><BR><BR>To love those whom men hate, and to hate those whom men love;-this 
<A NAME="259"></A>is to outrage the natural feeling of men. Calamities cannot fail to come 
<A NAME="260"></A>down on him who does so.
<A NAME="261"></A><BR><BR>Thus we see that the sovereign has a great course to pursue. He 
<A NAME="262"></A>must show entire self-devotion and sincerity to attain it, and by pride 
<A NAME="263"></A>and extravagance he will fail of it.
<A NAME="264"></A><BR><BR>There is a great course also for the production of wealth. Let 
<A NAME="265"></A>the producers be many and the consumers few. Let there be activity in the 
<A NAME="266"></A>production, and economy in the expenditure. Then the wealth will always 
<A NAME="267"></A>be sufficient.
<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR>The virtuous ruler, by means of his wealth, makes himself more 
<A NAME="269"></A>distinguished. The vicious ruler accumulates wealth, at the expense of 
<A NAME="270"></A>his life.
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>Never has there been a case of the sovereign loving benevolence, 
<A NAME="272"></A>and the people not loving righteousness. Never has there been a case where 
<A NAME="273"></A>the people have loved righteousness, and the affairs of the sovereign have 
<A NAME="274"></A>not been carried to completion. And never has there been a case where the 
<A NAME="275"></A>wealth in such a state, collected in the treasuries and arsenals, did not 
<A NAME="276"></A>continue in the sovereign's possession.
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR>The officer Mang Hsien said, "He who keeps horses and a carriage 
<A NAME="278"></A>does not look after fowls and pigs. The family which keeps its stores of 
<A NAME="279"></A>ice does not rear cattle or sheep. So, the house which possesses a hundred 
<A NAME="280"></A>chariots should not keep a minister to look out for imposts that he may 
<A NAME="281"></A>lay them on the people. Than to have such a minister, it were better for 
<A NAME="282"></A>that house to have one who should rob it of its revenues." This is in accordance 
<A NAME="283"></A>with the saying:-"In a state, pecuniary gain is not to be considered to 
<A NAME="284"></A>be prosperity, but its prosperity will be found in righteousness."
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>When he who presides over a state or a family makes his revenues 
<A NAME="286"></A>his chief business, he must be under the influence of some small, mean 
<A NAME="287"></A>man. He may consider this man to be good; but when such a person is employed 
<A NAME="288"></A>in the administration of a state or family, calamities from Heaven, and 
<A NAME="289"></A>injuries from men, will befall it together, and, though a good man may 
<A NAME="290"></A>take his place, he will not be able to remedy the evil. This illustrates 
<A NAME="291"></A>again the saying, "In a state, gain is not to be considered prosperity, 
<A NAME="292"></A>but its prosperity will be found in righteousness."
