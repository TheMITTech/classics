<A NAME="1"></A><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>The Doctrine of the Mean</B></FONT>
<A NAME="2"></A><BR><BR>By Confucius
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written ca. 500 B.C.E</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>What Heaven has conferred is called The Nature; an accordance with this 
<A NAME="11"></A>nature is called The Path of duty; the regulation of this path is called 
<A NAME="12"></A>Instruction.
<A NAME="13"></A><BR><BR>The path may not be left for an instant. If it could be left, it 
<A NAME="14"></A>would not be the path. On this account, the superior man does not wait 
<A NAME="15"></A>till he sees things, to be cautious, nor till he hears things, to be 
<A NAME="16"></A>apprehensive.
<A NAME="17"></A><BR><BR>There is nothing more visible than what is secret, and nothing 
<A NAME="18"></A>more manifest than what is minute. Therefore the superior man is watchful 
<A NAME="19"></A>over himself, when he is alone.
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><BR>While there are no stirrings of pleasure, anger, sorrow, or joy, 
<A NAME="21"></A>the mind may be said to be in the state of Equilibrium. When those feelings 
<A NAME="22"></A>have been stirred, and they act in their due degree, there ensues what 
<A NAME="23"></A>may be called the state of Harmony. This Equilibrium is the great root 
<A NAME="24"></A>from which grow all the human actings in the world, and this Harmony is 
<A NAME="25"></A>the universal path which they all should pursue.
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR>Let the states of equilibrium and harmony exist in perfection, 
<A NAME="27"></A>and a happy order will prevail throughout heaven and earth, and all things 
<A NAME="28"></A>will be nourished and flourish.
<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR>Chung-ni said, "The superior man embodies the course of the Mean; 
<A NAME="30"></A>the mean man acts contrary to the course of the Mean.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR>"The superior man's embodying the course of the Mean is because 
<A NAME="32"></A>he is a superior man, and so always maintains the Mean. The mean man's 
<A NAME="33"></A>acting contrary to the course of the Mean is because he is a mean man, 
<A NAME="34"></A>and has no caution."
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Perfect is the virtue which is according to the 
<A NAME="36"></A>Mean! Rare have they long been among the people, who could practice 
<A NAME="37"></A>it!
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "I know how it is that the path of the Mean is 
<A NAME="39"></A>not walked in:-The knowing go beyond it, and the stupid do not come up 
<A NAME="40"></A>to it. I know how it is that the path of the Mean is not understood:-The 
<A NAME="41"></A>men of talents and virtue go beyond it, and the worthless do not come up 
<A NAME="42"></A>to it.
<A NAME="43"></A><BR><BR>"There is no body but eats and drinks. But they are few who can 
<A NAME="44"></A>distinguish flavors."
<A NAME="45"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Alas! How is the path of the Mean 
<A NAME="46"></A>untrodden!"
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>The Master said, "There was Shun:-He indeed was greatly wise! Shun 
<A NAME="48"></A>loved to question others, and to study their words, though they might be 
<A NAME="49"></A>shallow. He concealed what was bad in them and displayed what was good. 
<A NAME="50"></A>He took hold of their two extremes, determined the Mean, and employed it 
<A NAME="51"></A>in his government of the people. It was by this that he was 
<A NAME="52"></A>Shun!"
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR>The Master said "Men all say, 'We are wise'; but being driven forward 
<A NAME="54"></A>and taken in a net, a trap, or a pitfall, they know not how to escape. 
<A NAME="55"></A>Men all say, 'We are wise'; but happening to choose the course of the Mean, 
<A NAME="56"></A>they are not able to keep it for a round month."
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR>The Master said "This was the manner of Hui:-he made choice of 
<A NAME="58"></A>the Mean, and whenever he got hold of what was good, he clasped it firmly, 
<A NAME="59"></A>as if wearing it on his breast, and did not lose it."
<A NAME="60"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "The kingdom, its states, and its families, may 
<A NAME="61"></A>be perfectly ruled; dignities and emoluments may be declined; naked weapons 
<A NAME="62"></A>may be trampled under the feet; but the course of the Mean cannot be attained 
<A NAME="63"></A>to."
<A NAME="64"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-lu asked about energy.
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>The Master said, "Do you mean the energy of the South, the energy of 
<A NAME="66"></A>the North, or the energy which you should cultivate 
<A NAME="67"></A>yourself?
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR>"To show forbearance and gentleness in teaching others; and not 
<A NAME="69"></A>to revenge unreasonable conduct:-this is the energy of southern regions, 
<A NAME="70"></A>and the good man makes it his study.
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>"To lie under arms; and meet death without regret:-this is the 
<A NAME="72"></A>energy of northern regions, and the forceful make it their 
<A NAME="73"></A>study.
<A NAME="74"></A><BR><BR>"Therefore, the superior man cultivates a friendly harmony, without 
<A NAME="75"></A>being weak.-How firm is he in his energy! He stands erect in the middle, 
<A NAME="76"></A>without inclining to either side.-How firm is he in his energy! When good 
<A NAME="77"></A>principles prevail in the government of his country, he does not change 
<A NAME="78"></A>from what he was in retirement. How firm is he in his energy! When bad 
<A NAME="79"></A>principles prevail in the country, he maintains his course to death without 
<A NAME="80"></A>changing.-How firm is he in his energy!"
<A NAME="81"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "To live in obscurity, and yet practice wonders, 
<A NAME="82"></A>in order to be mentioned with honor in future ages:-this is what I do not 
<A NAME="83"></A>do.
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><BR>"The good man tries to proceed according to the right path, but 
<A NAME="85"></A>when he has gone halfway, he abandons it:-I am not able so to 
<A NAME="86"></A>stop.
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR>"The superior man accords with the course of the Mean. Though he 
<A NAME="88"></A>may be all unknown, unregarded by the world, he feels no regret.-It is 
<A NAME="89"></A>only the sage who is able for this."
<A NAME="90"></A><BR><BR>The way which the superior man pursues, reaches wide and far, and 
<A NAME="91"></A>yet is secret.
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR>Common men and women, however ignorant, may intermeddle with the 
<A NAME="93"></A>knowledge of it; yet in its utmost reaches, there is that which even the 
<A NAME="94"></A>sage does not know. Common men and women, however much below the ordinary 
<A NAME="95"></A>standard of character, can carry it into practice; yet in its utmost reaches, 
<A NAME="96"></A>there is that which even the sage is not able to carry into practice. Great 
<A NAME="97"></A>as heaven and earth are, men still find some things in them with which 
<A NAME="98"></A>to be dissatisfied. Thus it is that, were the superior man to speak of 
<A NAME="99"></A>his way in all its greatness, nothing in the world would be found able 
<A NAME="100"></A>to embrace it, and were he to speak of it in its minuteness, nothing in 
<A NAME="101"></A>the world would be found able to split it.
<A NAME="102"></A><BR><BR>It is said in the Book of Poetry, "The hawk flies up to heaven; 
<A NAME="103"></A>the fishes leap in the deep." This expresses how this way is seen above 
<A NAME="104"></A>and below.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR>The way of the superior man may be found, in its simple elements, 
<A NAME="106"></A>in the intercourse of common men and women; but in its utmost reaches, 
<A NAME="107"></A>it shines brightly through Heaven and earth.
<A NAME="108"></A><BR><BR>The Master said "The path is not far from man. When men try to 
<A NAME="109"></A>pursue a course, which is far from the common indications of consciousness, 
<A NAME="110"></A>this course cannot be considered The Path.
<A NAME="111"></A><BR><BR>"In the Book of Poetry, it is said, 'In hewing an ax handle, in 
<A NAME="112"></A>hewing an ax handle, the pattern is not far off. We grasp one ax handle 
<A NAME="113"></A>to hew the other; and yet, if we look askance from the one to the other, 
<A NAME="114"></A>we may consider them as apart. Therefore, the superior man governs men, 
<A NAME="115"></A>according to their nature, with what is proper to them, and as soon as 
<A NAME="116"></A>they change what is wrong, he stops.
<A NAME="117"></A><BR><BR>"When one cultivates to the utmost the principles of his nature, 
<A NAME="118"></A>and exercises them on the principle of reciprocity, he is not far from 
<A NAME="119"></A>the path. What you do not like when done to yourself, do not do to 
<A NAME="120"></A>others.
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR>"In the way of the superior man there are four things, to not one 
<A NAME="122"></A>of which have I as yet attained.-To serve my father, as I would require 
<A NAME="123"></A>my son to serve me: to this I have not attained; to serve my prince as 
<A NAME="124"></A>I would require my minister to serve me: to this I have not attained; to 
<A NAME="125"></A>serve my elder brother as I would require my younger brother to serve me: 
<A NAME="126"></A>to this I have not attained; to set the example in behaving to a friend, 
<A NAME="127"></A>as I would require him to behave to me: to this I have not attained. Earnest 
<A NAME="128"></A>in practicing the ordinary virtues, and careful in speaking about them, 
<A NAME="129"></A>if, in his practice, he has anything defective, the superior man dares 
<A NAME="130"></A>not but exert himself; and if, in his words, he has any excess, he dares 
<A NAME="131"></A>not allow himself such license. Thus his words have respect to his actions, 
<A NAME="132"></A>and his actions have respect to his words; is it not just an entire sincerity 
<A NAME="133"></A>which marks the superior man?"
<A NAME="134"></A><BR><BR>The superior man does what is proper to the station in which he 
<A NAME="135"></A>is; he does not desire to go beyond this.
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>In a position of wealth and honor, he does what is proper to a 
<A NAME="137"></A>position of wealth and honor. In a poor and low position, he does what 
<A NAME="138"></A>is proper to a poor and low position. Situated among barbarous tribes, 
<A NAME="139"></A>he does what is proper to a situation among barbarous tribes. In a position 
<A NAME="140"></A>of sorrow and difficulty, he does what is proper to a position of sorrow 
<A NAME="141"></A>and difficulty. The superior man can find himself in no situation in which 
<A NAME="142"></A>he is not himself.
<A NAME="143"></A><BR><BR>In a high situation, he does not treat with contempt his inferiors. 
<A NAME="144"></A>In a low situation, he does not court the favor of his superiors. He rectifies 
<A NAME="145"></A>himself, and seeks for nothing from others, so that he has no dissatisfactions. 
<A NAME="146"></A>He does not murmur against Heaven, nor grumble against 
<A NAME="147"></A>men.
<A NAME="148"></A><BR><BR>Thus it is that the superior man is quiet and calm, waiting for 
<A NAME="149"></A>the appointments of Heaven, while the mean man walks in dangerous paths, 
<A NAME="150"></A>looking for lucky occurrences.
<A NAME="151"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "In archery we have something like the way of 
<A NAME="152"></A>the superior man. When the archer misses the center of the target, he turns 
<A NAME="153"></A>round and seeks for the cause of his failure in himself."
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR>The way of the superior man may be compared to what takes place 
<A NAME="155"></A>in traveling, when to go to a distance we must first traverse the space 
<A NAME="156"></A>that is near, and in ascending a height, when we must begin from the lower 
<A NAME="157"></A>ground.
<A NAME="158"></A><BR><BR>It is said in the Book of Poetry, "Happy union with wife and children 
<A NAME="159"></A>is like the music of lutes and harps. When there is concord among brethren, 
<A NAME="160"></A>the harmony is delightful and enduring. Thus may you regulate your family, 
<A NAME="161"></A>and enjoy the pleasure of your wife and children."
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "In such a state of things, parents have entire 
<A NAME="163"></A>complacence!"
<A NAME="164"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "How abundantly do spiritual beings display the 
<A NAME="165"></A>powers that belong to them!
<A NAME="166"></A><BR><BR>"We look for them, but do not see them; we listen to, but do not 
<A NAME="167"></A>hear them; yet they enter into all things, and there is nothing without 
<A NAME="168"></A>them.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>"They cause all the people in the kingdom to fast and purify themselves, 
<A NAME="170"></A>and array themselves in their richest dresses, in order to attend at their 
<A NAME="171"></A>sacrifices. Then, like overflowing water, they seem to be over the heads, 
<A NAME="172"></A>and on the right and left of their worshippers.
<A NAME="173"></A><BR><BR>"It is said in the Book of Poetry, 'The approaches of the spirits, 
<A NAME="174"></A>you cannot sunrise; and can you treat them with indifference?'
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR>"Such is the manifestness of what is minute! Such is the impossibility 
<A NAME="176"></A>of repressing the outgoings of sincerity!"
<A NAME="177"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "How greatly filial was Shun! His virtue was that 
<A NAME="178"></A>of a sage; his dignity was the throne; his riches were all within the four 
<A NAME="179"></A>seas. He offered his sacrifices in his ancestral temple, and his descendants 
<A NAME="180"></A>preserved the sacrifices to himself.
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR>"Therefore having such great virtue, it could not but be that he 
<A NAME="182"></A>should obtain the throne, that he should obtain those riches, that he should 
<A NAME="183"></A>obtain his fame, that he should attain to his long life.
<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR>"Thus it is that Heaven, in the production of things, is sure to 
<A NAME="185"></A>be bountiful to them, according to their qualities. Hence the tree that 
<A NAME="186"></A>is flourishing, it nourishes, while that which is ready to fall, it 
<A NAME="187"></A>overthrows.
<A NAME="188"></A><BR><BR>"In the Book of Poetry, it is said, 'The admirable amiable prince 
<A NAME="189"></A>displayed conspicuously his excelling virtue, adjusting his people, and 
<A NAME="190"></A>adjusting his officers. Therefore, he received from Heaven his emoluments 
<A NAME="191"></A>of dignity. It protected him, assisted him, decreed him the throne; sending 
<A NAME="192"></A>from Heaven these favors, as it were repeatedly.'
<A NAME="193"></A><BR><BR>"We may say therefore that he who is greatly virtuous will be sure 
<A NAME="194"></A>to receive the appointment of Heaven."
<A NAME="195"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "It is only King Wan of whom it can be said that 
<A NAME="196"></A>he had no cause for grief! His father was King Chi, and his son was King 
<A NAME="197"></A>Wu. His father laid the foundations of his dignity, and his son transmitted 
<A NAME="198"></A>it.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR>"King Wu continued the enterprise of King T'ai, King Chi, and King 
<A NAME="200"></A>Wan. He once buckled on his armor, and got possession of the kingdom. He 
<A NAME="201"></A>did not lose the distinguished personal reputation which he had throughout 
<A NAME="202"></A>the kingdom. His dignity was the royal throne. His riches were the possession 
<A NAME="203"></A>of all within the four seas. He offered his sacrifices in his ancestral 
<A NAME="204"></A>temple, and his descendants maintained the sacrifices to 
<A NAME="205"></A>himself.
<A NAME="206"></A><BR><BR>"It was in his old age that King Wu received the appointment to 
<A NAME="207"></A>the throne, and the duke of Chau completed the virtuous course of Wan and 
<A NAME="208"></A>Wu. He carried up the title of king to T'ai and Chi, and sacrificed to 
<A NAME="209"></A>all the former dukes above them with the royal ceremonies. And this rule 
<A NAME="210"></A>he extended to the princes of the kingdom, the great officers, the scholars, 
<A NAME="211"></A>and the common people. If the father were a great officer and the son a 
<A NAME="212"></A>scholar, then the burial was that due to a great officer, and the sacrifice 
<A NAME="213"></A>that due to a scholar. If the father were a scholar and the son a great 
<A NAME="214"></A>officer, then the burial was that due to a scholar, and the sacrifice that 
<A NAME="215"></A>due to a great officer. The one year's mourning was made to extend only 
<A NAME="216"></A>to the great officers, but the three years' mourning extended to the Son 
<A NAME="217"></A>of Heaven. In the mourning for a father or mother, he allowed no difference 
<A NAME="218"></A>between the noble and the mean.
<A NAME="219"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "How far-extending was the filial piety of King 
<A NAME="220"></A>Wu and the duke of Chau!
<A NAME="221"></A><BR><BR>"Now filial piety is seen in the skillful carrying out of the wishes 
<A NAME="222"></A>of our forefathers, and the skillful carrying forward of their 
<A NAME="223"></A>undertakings.
<A NAME="224"></A><BR><BR>"In spring and autumn, they repaired and beautified the temple 
<A NAME="225"></A>halls of their fathers, set forth their ancestral vessels, displayed their 
<A NAME="226"></A>various robes, and presented the offerings of the several 
<A NAME="227"></A>seasons.
<A NAME="228"></A><BR><BR>"By means of the ceremonies of the ancestral temple, they distinguished 
<A NAME="229"></A>the royal kindred according to their order of descent. By ordering the 
<A NAME="230"></A>parties present according to their rank, they distinguished the more noble 
<A NAME="231"></A>and the less. By the arrangement of the services, they made a distinction 
<A NAME="232"></A>of talents and worth. In the ceremony of general pledging, the inferiors 
<A NAME="233"></A>presented the cup to their superiors, and thus something was given the 
<A NAME="234"></A>lowest to do. At the concluding feast, places were given according to the 
<A NAME="235"></A>hair, and thus was made the distinction of years.
<A NAME="236"></A><BR><BR>"They occupied the places of their forefathers, practiced their 
<A NAME="237"></A>ceremonies, and performed their music. They reverenced those whom they 
<A NAME="238"></A>honored, and loved those whom they regarded with affection. Thus they served 
<A NAME="239"></A>the dead as they would have served them alive; they served the departed 
<A NAME="240"></A>as they would have served them had they been continued among 
<A NAME="241"></A>them.
<A NAME="242"></A><BR><BR>"By the ceremonies of the sacrifices to Heaven and Earth they served 
<A NAME="243"></A>God, and by the ceremonies of the ancestral temple they sacrificed to their 
<A NAME="244"></A>ancestors. He who understands the ceremonies of the sacrifices to Heaven 
<A NAME="245"></A>and Earth, and the meaning of the several sacrifices to ancestors, would 
<A NAME="246"></A>find the government of a kingdom as easy as to look into his 
<A NAME="247"></A>palm!"
<A NAME="248"></A><BR><BR>The Duke Ai asked about government.
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>The Master said, "The government of Wan and Wu is displayed in the 
<A NAME="250"></A>records,-the tablets of wood and bamboo. Let there be the men and the government 
<A NAME="251"></A>will flourish; but without the men, their government decays and 
<A NAME="252"></A>ceases.
<A NAME="253"></A><BR><BR>"With the right men the growth of government is rapid, just as 
<A NAME="254"></A>vegetation is rapid in the earth; and, moreover, their government might 
<A NAME="255"></A>be called an easily-growing rush.
<A NAME="256"></A><BR><BR>"Therefore the administration of government lies in getting proper 
<A NAME="257"></A>men. Such men are to be got by means of the ruler's own character. That 
<A NAME="258"></A>character is to be cultivated by his treading in the ways of duty. And 
<A NAME="259"></A>the treading those ways of duty is to be cultivated by the cherishing of 
<A NAME="260"></A>benevolence.
<A NAME="261"></A><BR><BR>"Benevolence is the characteristic element of humanity, and the 
<A NAME="262"></A>great exercise of it is in loving relatives. Righteousness is the accordance 
<A NAME="263"></A>of actions with what is right, and the great exercise of it is in honoring 
<A NAME="264"></A>the worthy. The decreasing measures of the love due to relatives, and the 
<A NAME="265"></A>steps in the honor due to the worthy, are produced by the principle of 
<A NAME="266"></A>propriety.
<A NAME="267"></A><BR><BR>"When those in inferior situations do not possess the confidence 
<A NAME="268"></A>of their superiors, they cannot retain the government of the 
<A NAME="269"></A>people.
<A NAME="270"></A><BR><BR>"Hence the sovereign may not neglect the cultivation of his own 
<A NAME="271"></A>character. Wishing to cultivate his character, he may not neglect to serve 
<A NAME="272"></A>his parents. In order to serve his parents, he may not neglect to acquire 
<A NAME="273"></A>knowledge of men. In order to know men, he may not dispense with a knowledge 
<A NAME="274"></A>of Heaven.
<A NAME="275"></A><BR><BR>"The duties of universal obligation are five and the virtues wherewith 
<A NAME="276"></A>they are practiced are three. The duties are those between sovereign and 
<A NAME="277"></A>minister, between father and son, between husband and wife, between elder 
<A NAME="278"></A>brother and younger, and those belonging to the intercourse of friends. 
<A NAME="279"></A>Those five are the duties of universal obligation. Knowledge, magnanimity, 
<A NAME="280"></A>and energy, these three, are the virtues universally binding. And the means 
<A NAME="281"></A>by which they carry the duties into practice is singleness.
<A NAME="282"></A><BR><BR>"Some are born with the knowledge of those duties; some know them 
<A NAME="283"></A>by study; and some acquire the knowledge after a painful feeling of their 
<A NAME="284"></A>ignorance. But the knowledge being possessed, it comes to the same thing. 
<A NAME="285"></A>Some practice them with a natural ease; some from a desire for their advantages; 
<A NAME="286"></A>and some by strenuous effort. But the achievement being made, it comes 
<A NAME="287"></A>to the same thing."
<A NAME="288"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "To be fond of learning is to be near to knowledge. 
<A NAME="289"></A>To practice with vigor is to be near to magnanimity. To possess the feeling 
<A NAME="290"></A>of shame is to be near to energy.
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR>"He who knows these three things knows how to cultivate his own 
<A NAME="292"></A>character. Knowing how to cultivate his own character, he knows how to 
<A NAME="293"></A>govern other men. Knowing how to govern other men, he knows how to govern 
<A NAME="294"></A>the kingdom with all its states and families.
<A NAME="295"></A><BR><BR>"All who have the government of the kingdom with its states and 
<A NAME="296"></A>families have nine standard rules to follow;-viz., the cultivation of their 
<A NAME="297"></A>own characters; the honoring of men of virtue and talents; affection towards 
<A NAME="298"></A>their relatives; respect towards the great ministers; kind and considerate 
<A NAME="299"></A>treatment of the whole body of officers; dealing with the mass of the people 
<A NAME="300"></A>as children; encouraging the resort of all classes of artisans; indulgent 
<A NAME="301"></A>treatment of men from a distance; and the kindly cherishing of the princes 
<A NAME="302"></A>of the states.
<A NAME="303"></A><BR><BR>"By the ruler's cultivation of his own character, the duties of 
<A NAME="304"></A>universal obligation are set forth. By honoring men of virtue and talents, 
<A NAME="305"></A>he is preserved from errors of judgment. By showing affection to his relatives, 
<A NAME="306"></A>there is no grumbling nor resentment among his uncles and brethren. By 
<A NAME="307"></A>respecting the great ministers, he is kept from errors in the practice 
<A NAME="308"></A>of government. By kind and considerate treatment of the whole body of officers, 
<A NAME="309"></A>they are led to make the most grateful return for his courtesies. By dealing 
<A NAME="310"></A>with the mass of the people as his children, they are led to exhort one 
<A NAME="311"></A>another to what is good. By encouraging the resort of an classes of artisans, 
<A NAME="312"></A>his resources for expenditure are rendered ample. By indulgent treatment 
<A NAME="313"></A>of men from a distance, they are brought to resort to him from all quarters. 
<A NAME="314"></A>And by kindly cherishing the princes of the states, the whole kingdom is 
<A NAME="315"></A>brought to revere him.
<A NAME="316"></A><BR><BR>"Self-adjustment and purification, with careful regulation of his 
<A NAME="317"></A>dress, and the not making a movement contrary to the rules of propriety 
<A NAME="318"></A>this is the way for a ruler to cultivate his person. Discarding slanderers, 
<A NAME="319"></A>and keeping himself from the seductions of beauty; making light of riches, 
<A NAME="320"></A>and giving honor to virtue-this is the way for him to encourage men of 
<A NAME="321"></A>worth and talents. Giving them places of honor and large emolument. and 
<A NAME="322"></A>sharing with them in their likes and dislikes-this is the way for him to 
<A NAME="323"></A>encourage his relatives to love him. Giving them numerous officers to discharge 
<A NAME="324"></A>their orders and commissions:-this is the way for him to encourage the 
<A NAME="325"></A>great ministers. According to them a generous confidence, and making their 
<A NAME="326"></A>emoluments large:-this is the way to encourage the body of officers. Employing 
<A NAME="327"></A>them only at the proper times, and making the imposts light:-this is the 
<A NAME="328"></A>way to encourage the people. By daily examinations and monthly trials, 
<A NAME="329"></A>and by making their rations in accordance with their labors:-this is the 
<A NAME="330"></A>way to encourage the classes of artisans. To escort them on their departure 
<A NAME="331"></A>and meet them on their coming; to commend the good among them, and show 
<A NAME="332"></A>compassion to the incompetent:-this is the way to treat indulgently men 
<A NAME="333"></A>from a distance. To restore families whose line of succession has been 
<A NAME="334"></A>broken, and to revive states that have been extinguished; to reduce to 
<A NAME="335"></A>order states that are in confusion, and support those which are in peril; 
<A NAME="336"></A>to have fixed times for their own reception at court, and the reception 
<A NAME="337"></A>of their envoys; to send them away after liberal treatment, and welcome 
<A NAME="338"></A>their coming with small contributions:-this is the way to cherish the princes 
<A NAME="339"></A>of the states.
<A NAME="340"></A><BR><BR>"All who have the government of the kingdom with its states and 
<A NAME="341"></A>families have the above nine standard rules. And the means by which they 
<A NAME="342"></A>are carried into practice is singleness.
<A NAME="343"></A><BR><BR>"In all things success depends on previous preparation, and without 
<A NAME="344"></A>such previous preparation there is sure to be failure. If what is to be 
<A NAME="345"></A>spoken be previously determined, there will be no stumbling. If affairs 
<A NAME="346"></A>be previously determined, there will be no difficulty with them. If one's 
<A NAME="347"></A>actions have been previously determined, there will be no sorrow in connection 
<A NAME="348"></A>with them. If principles of conduct have been previously determined, the 
<A NAME="349"></A>practice of them will be inexhaustible.
<A NAME="350"></A><BR><BR>"When those in inferior situations do not obtain the confidence 
<A NAME="351"></A>of the sovereign, they cannot succeed in governing the people. There is 
<A NAME="352"></A>a way to obtain the confidence of the sovereign;-if one is not trusted 
<A NAME="353"></A>by his friends, he will not get the confidence of his sovereign. There 
<A NAME="354"></A>is a way to being trusted by one's friends;-if one is not obedient to his 
<A NAME="355"></A>parents, he will not be true to friends. There is a way to being obedient 
<A NAME="356"></A>to one's parents;-if one, on turning his thoughts in upon himself, finds 
<A NAME="357"></A>a want of sincerity, he will not be obedient to his parents. There is a 
<A NAME="358"></A>way to the attainment of sincerity in one's self; -if a man do not understand 
<A NAME="359"></A>what is good, he will not attain sincerity in himself.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR>"Sincerity is the way of Heaven. The attainment of sincerity is 
<A NAME="361"></A>the way of men. He who possesses sincerity is he who, without an effort, 
<A NAME="362"></A>hits what is right, and apprehends, without the exercise of thought;-he 
<A NAME="363"></A>is the sage who naturally and easily embodies the right way. He who attains 
<A NAME="364"></A>to sincerity is he who chooses what is good, and firmly holds it 
<A NAME="365"></A>fast.
<A NAME="366"></A><BR><BR>"To this attainment there are requisite the extensive study of 
<A NAME="367"></A>what is good, accurate inquiry about it, careful reflection on it, the 
<A NAME="368"></A>clear discrimination of it, and the earnest practice of 
<A NAME="369"></A>it.
<A NAME="370"></A><BR><BR>"The superior man, while there is anything he has not studied, 
<A NAME="371"></A>or while in what he has studied there is anything he cannot understand, 
<A NAME="372"></A>Will not intermit his labor. While there is anything he has not inquired 
<A NAME="373"></A>about, or anything in what he has inquired about which he does not know, 
<A NAME="374"></A>he will not intermit his labor. While there is anything which he has not 
<A NAME="375"></A>reflected on, or anything in what he has reflected on which he does not 
<A NAME="376"></A>apprehend, he will not intermit his labor. While there is anything which 
<A NAME="377"></A>he has not discriminated or his discrimination is not clear, he will not 
<A NAME="378"></A>intermit his labor. If there be anything which he has not practiced, or 
<A NAME="379"></A>his practice fails in earnestness, he will not intermit his labor. If another 
<A NAME="380"></A>man succeed by one effort, he will use a hundred efforts. If another man 
<A NAME="381"></A>succeed by ten efforts, he will use a thousand.
<A NAME="382"></A><BR><BR>"Let a man proceed in this way, and, though dull, he will surely 
<A NAME="383"></A>become intelligent; though weak, he will surely become 
<A NAME="384"></A>strong."
<A NAME="385"></A><BR><BR>When we have intelligence resulting from sincerity, this condition 
<A NAME="386"></A>is to be ascribed to nature; when we have sincerity resulting from intelligence, 
<A NAME="387"></A>this condition is to be ascribed to instruction. But given the sincerity, 
<A NAME="388"></A>and there shall be the intelligence; given the intelligence, and there 
<A NAME="389"></A>shall be the sincerity.
<A NAME="390"></A><BR><BR>It is only he who is possessed of the most complete sincerity that 
<A NAME="391"></A>can exist under heaven, who can give its fun development to his nature. 
<A NAME="392"></A>Able to give its full development to his own nature, he can do the same 
<A NAME="393"></A>to the nature of other men. Able to give its full development to the nature 
<A NAME="394"></A>of other men, he can give their full development to the natures of animals 
<A NAME="395"></A>and things. Able to give their full development to the natures of creatures 
<A NAME="396"></A>and things, he can assist the transforming and nourishing powers of Heaven 
<A NAME="397"></A>and Earth. Able to assist the transforming and nourishing powers of Heaven 
<A NAME="398"></A>and Earth, he may with Heaven and Earth form a ternion.
<A NAME="399"></A><BR><BR>Next to the above is he who cultivates to the utmost the shoots 
<A NAME="400"></A>of goodness in him. From those he can attain to the possession of sincerity. 
<A NAME="401"></A>This sincerity becomes apparent. From being apparent, it becomes manifest. 
<A NAME="402"></A>From being manifest, it becomes brilliant. Brilliant, it affects others. 
<A NAME="403"></A>Affecting others, they are changed by it. Changed by it, they are transformed. 
<A NAME="404"></A>It is only he who is possessed of the most complete sincerity that can 
<A NAME="405"></A>exist under heaven, who can transform.
<A NAME="406"></A><BR><BR>It is characteristic of the most entire sincerity to be able to 
<A NAME="407"></A>foreknow. When a nation or family is about to flourish, there are sure 
<A NAME="408"></A>to be happy omens; and when it is about to perish, there are sure to be 
<A NAME="409"></A>unlucky omens. Such events are seen in the milfoil and tortoise, and affect 
<A NAME="410"></A>the movements of the four limbs. When calamity or happiness is about to 
<A NAME="411"></A>come, the good shall certainly be foreknown by him, and the evil also. 
<A NAME="412"></A>Therefore the individual possessed of the most complete sincerity is like 
<A NAME="413"></A>a spirit.
<A NAME="414"></A><BR><BR>Sincerity is that whereby self-completion is effected, and its 
<A NAME="415"></A>way is that by which man must direct himself.
<A NAME="416"></A><BR><BR>Sincerity is the end and beginning of things; without sincerity 
<A NAME="417"></A>there would be nothing. On this account, the superior man regards the attainment 
<A NAME="418"></A>of sincerity as the most excellent thing.
<A NAME="419"></A><BR><BR>The possessor of sincerity does not merely accomplish the self-completion 
<A NAME="420"></A>of himself. With this quality he completes other men and things also. The 
<A NAME="421"></A>completing himself shows his perfect virtue. The completing other men and 
<A NAME="422"></A>things shows his knowledge. But these are virtues belonging to the nature, 
<A NAME="423"></A>and this is the way by which a union is effected of the external and internal. 
<A NAME="424"></A>Therefore, whenever he-the entirely sincere man-employs them,-that is, 
<A NAME="425"></A>these virtues, their action will be right.
<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR>Hence to entire sincerity there belongs ceaselessness.
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>Not ceasing, it continues long. Continuing long, it evidences 
<A NAME="428"></A>itself.
<A NAME="429"></A><BR><BR>Evidencing itself, it reaches far. Reaching far, it becomes large 
<A NAME="430"></A>and substantial. Large and substantial, it becomes high and 
<A NAME="431"></A>brilliant.
<A NAME="432"></A><BR><BR>Large and substantial;-this is how it contains all things. High 
<A NAME="433"></A>and brilliant;-this is how it overspreads all things. Reaching far and 
<A NAME="434"></A>continuing long;-this is how it perfects all things.
<A NAME="435"></A><BR><BR>So large and substantial, the individual possessing it is the co-equal 
<A NAME="436"></A>of Earth. So high and brilliant, it makes him the co-equal of Heaven. So 
<A NAME="437"></A>far-reaching and long-continuing, it makes him infinite.
<A NAME="438"></A><BR><BR>Such being its nature, without any display, it becomes manifested; 
<A NAME="439"></A>without any movement, it produces changes; and without any effort, it accomplishes 
<A NAME="440"></A>its ends.
<A NAME="441"></A><BR><BR>The way of Heaven and Earth may be completely declared in one sentence.-They 
<A NAME="442"></A>are without any doubleness, and so they produce things in a manner that 
<A NAME="443"></A>is unfathomable.
<A NAME="444"></A><BR><BR>The way of Heaven and Earth is large and substantial, high and 
<A NAME="445"></A>brilliant, far-reaching and long-enduring.
<A NAME="446"></A><BR><BR>The Heaven now before us is only this bright shining spot; but 
<A NAME="447"></A>when viewed in its inexhaustible extent, the sun, moon, stars, and constellations 
<A NAME="448"></A>of the zodiac, are suspended in it, and all things are overspread by it. 
<A NAME="449"></A>The earth before us is but a handful of soil; but when regarded in its 
<A NAME="450"></A>breadth and thickness, it sustains mountains like the Hwa and the Yo, without 
<A NAME="451"></A>feeling their weight, and contains the rivers and seas, without their leaking 
<A NAME="452"></A>away. The mountain now before us appears only a stone; but when contemplated 
<A NAME="453"></A>in all the vastness of its size, we see how the grass and trees are produced 
<A NAME="454"></A>on it, and birds and beasts dwell on it, and precious things which men 
<A NAME="455"></A>treasure up are found on it. The water now before us appears but a ladleful; 
<A NAME="456"></A>yet extending our view to its unfathomable depths, the largest tortoises, 
<A NAME="457"></A>iguanas, iguanodons, dragons, fishes, and turtles, are produced in it, 
<A NAME="458"></A>articles of value and sources of wealth abound in it.
<A NAME="459"></A><BR><BR>It is said in the Book of Poetry, "The ordinances of Heaven, how 
<A NAME="460"></A>profound are they and unceasing!" The meaning is, that it is thus that 
<A NAME="461"></A>Heaven is Heaven. And again, "How illustrious was it, the singleness of 
<A NAME="462"></A>the virtue of King Wan!" indicating that it was thus that King Wan was 
<A NAME="463"></A>what he was. Singleness likewise is unceasing.
<A NAME="464"></A><BR><BR>How great is the path proper to the Sage!
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>Like overflowing water, it sends forth and nourishes all things, and 
<A NAME="466"></A>rises up to the height of heaven.
<A NAME="467"></A><BR><BR>All-complete is its greatness! It embraces the three hundred rules 
<A NAME="468"></A>of ceremony, and the three thousand rules of demeanor.
<A NAME="469"></A><BR><BR>It waits for the proper man, and then it is 
<A NAME="470"></A>trodden.
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>Hence it is said, "Only by perfect virtue can the perfect path, in 
<A NAME="472"></A>all its courses, be made a fact."
<A NAME="473"></A><BR><BR>Therefore, the superior man honors his virtuous nature, and maintains 
<A NAME="474"></A>constant inquiry and study, seeking to carry it out to its breadth and 
<A NAME="475"></A>greatness, so as to omit none of the more exquisite and minute points which 
<A NAME="476"></A>it embraces, and to raise it to its greatest height and brilliancy, so 
<A NAME="477"></A>as to pursue the course of the Mean. He cherishes his old knowledge, and 
<A NAME="478"></A>is continually acquiring new. He exerts an honest, generous earnestness, 
<A NAME="479"></A>in the esteem and practice of all propriety.
<A NAME="480"></A><BR><BR>Thus, when occupying a high situation he is not proud, and in a 
<A NAME="481"></A>low situation he is not insubordinate. When the kingdom is well governed, 
<A NAME="482"></A>he is sure by his words to rise; and when it is ill governed, he is sure 
<A NAME="483"></A>by his silence to command forbearance to himself. Is not this what we find 
<A NAME="484"></A>in the Book of Poetry,-"Intelligent is he and prudent, and so preserves 
<A NAME="485"></A>his person?"
<A NAME="486"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, Let a man who is ignorant be fond of using his 
<A NAME="487"></A>own judgment; let a man without rank be fond of assuming a directing power 
<A NAME="488"></A>to himself; let a man who is living in the present age go back to the ways 
<A NAME="489"></A>of antiquity;-on the persons of all who act thus calamities will be sure 
<A NAME="490"></A>to come.
<A NAME="491"></A><BR><BR>To no one but the Son of Heaven does it belong to order ceremonies, 
<A NAME="492"></A>to fix the measures, and to determine the written characters.
<A NAME="493"></A><BR><BR>Now over the kingdom, carriages have all wheels, of the-same size; 
<A NAME="494"></A>all writing is with the same characters; and for conduct there are the 
<A NAME="495"></A>same rules.
<A NAME="496"></A><BR><BR>One may occupy the throne, but if he have not the proper virtue, 
<A NAME="497"></A>he may not dare to make ceremonies or music. One may have the virtue, but 
<A NAME="498"></A>if he do not occupy the throne, he may not presume to make ceremonies or 
<A NAME="499"></A>music.
<A NAME="500"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "I may describe the ceremonies of the Hsia dynasty, 
<A NAME="501"></A>but Chi cannot sufficiently attest my words. I have learned the ceremonies 
<A NAME="502"></A>of the Yin dynasty, and in Sung they still continue. I have learned the 
<A NAME="503"></A>ceremonies of Chau, which are now used, and I follow 
<A NAME="504"></A>Chau."
<A NAME="505"></A><BR><BR>He who attains to the sovereignty of the kingdom, having those 
<A NAME="506"></A>three important things, shall be able to effect that there shall be few 
<A NAME="507"></A>errors under his government.
<A NAME="508"></A><BR><BR>However excellent may have been the regulations of those of former 
<A NAME="509"></A>times, they cannot be attested. Not being attested, they cannot command 
<A NAME="510"></A>credence, and not being credited, the people would not follow them. However 
<A NAME="511"></A>excellent might be the regulations made by one in an inferior situation, 
<A NAME="512"></A>he is not in a position to be honored. Unhonored, he cannot command credence, 
<A NAME="513"></A>and not being credited, the people would not follow his 
<A NAME="514"></A>rules.
<A NAME="515"></A><BR><BR>Therefore the institutions of the Ruler are rooted in his own character 
<A NAME="516"></A>and conduct, and sufficient attestation of them is given by the masses 
<A NAME="517"></A>of the people. He examines them by comparison with those of the three kings, 
<A NAME="518"></A>and finds them without mistake. He sets them up before Heaven and Earth, 
<A NAME="519"></A>and finds nothing in them contrary to their mode of operation. He presents 
<A NAME="520"></A>himself with them before spiritual beings, and no doubts about them arise. 
<A NAME="521"></A>He is prepared to wait for the rise of a sage a hundred ages after, and 
<A NAME="522"></A>has no misgivings.
<A NAME="523"></A><BR><BR>His presenting himself with his institutions before spiritual beings, 
<A NAME="524"></A>without any doubts arising about them, shows that he knows Heaven. His 
<A NAME="525"></A>being prepared, without any misgivings, to wait for the rise of a sage 
<A NAME="526"></A>a hundred ages after, shows that he knows men.
<A NAME="527"></A><BR><BR>Such being the case, the movements of such a ruler, illustrating 
<A NAME="528"></A>his institutions, constitute an example to the world for ages. His acts 
<A NAME="529"></A>are for ages a law to the kingdom. His words are for ages a lesson to the 
<A NAME="530"></A>kingdom. Those who are far from him look longingly for him; and those who 
<A NAME="531"></A>are near him are never wearied with him.
<A NAME="532"></A><BR><BR>It is said in the Book of Poetry,-"Not disliked there, not tired 
<A NAME="533"></A>of here, from day to day and night tonight, will they perpetuate their 
<A NAME="534"></A>praise." Never has there been a ruler, who did not realize this description, 
<A NAME="535"></A>that obtained an early renown throughout the kingdom.
<A NAME="536"></A><BR><BR>Chung-ni handed down the doctrines of Yao and Shun, as if they 
<A NAME="537"></A>had been his ancestors, and elegantly displayed the regulations of Wan 
<A NAME="538"></A>and Wul taking them as his model. Above, he harmonized with the times of 
<A NAME="539"></A>Heaven, and below, he was conformed to the water and 
<A NAME="540"></A>land.
<A NAME="541"></A><BR><BR>He may be compared to Heaven and Earth in their supporting and 
<A NAME="542"></A>containing, their overshadowing and curtaining, all things. He may be compared 
<A NAME="543"></A>to the four seasons in their alternating progress, and to the sun and moon 
<A NAME="544"></A>in their successive shining.
<A NAME="545"></A><BR><BR>All things are nourished together without their injuring one another. 
<A NAME="546"></A>The courses of the seasons, and of the sun and moon, are pursued without 
<A NAME="547"></A>any collision among them. The smaller energies are like river currents; 
<A NAME="548"></A>the greater energies are seen in mighty transformations. It is this which 
<A NAME="549"></A>makes heaven and earth so great.
<A NAME="550"></A><BR><BR>It is only he, possessed of all sagely qualities that can exist 
<A NAME="551"></A>under heaven, who shows himself quick in apprehension, clear in discernment, 
<A NAME="552"></A>of far-reaching intelligence, and all-embracing knowledge, fitted to exercise 
<A NAME="553"></A>rule; magnanimous, generous, benign, and mild, fitted to exercise forbearance; 
<A NAME="554"></A>impulsive, energetic, firm, and enduring, fitted to maintain a firm hold; 
<A NAME="555"></A>self-adjusted, grave, never swerving from the Mean, and correct, fitted 
<A NAME="556"></A>to command reverence; accomplished, distinctive, concentrative, and searching, 
<A NAME="557"></A>fitted to exercise discrimination.
<A NAME="558"></A><BR><BR>All-embracing is he and vast, deep and active as a fountain, sending 
<A NAME="559"></A>forth in their due season his virtues.
<A NAME="560"></A><BR><BR>All-embracing and vast, he is like Heaven. Deep and active as a 
<A NAME="561"></A>fountain, he is like the abyss. He is seen, and the people all reverence 
<A NAME="562"></A>him; he speaks, and the people all believe him; he acts, and the people 
<A NAME="563"></A>all are pleased with him.
<A NAME="564"></A><BR><BR>Therefore his fame overspreads the Middle Kingdom, and extends 
<A NAME="565"></A>to all barbarous tribes. Wherever ships and carriages reach; wherever the 
<A NAME="566"></A>strength of man penetrates; wherever the heavens overshadow and the earth 
<A NAME="567"></A>sustains; wherever the sun and moon shine; wherever frosts and dews fall:-all 
<A NAME="568"></A>who have blood and breath unfeignedly honor and love him. Hence it is said,-"He 
<A NAME="569"></A>is the equal of Heaven."
<A NAME="570"></A><BR><BR>It is only the individual possessed of the most entire sincerity 
<A NAME="571"></A>that can exist under Heaven, who can adjust the great invariable relations 
<A NAME="572"></A>of mankind, establish the great fundamental virtues of humanity, and know 
<A NAME="573"></A>the transforming and nurturing operations of Heaven and Earth;-shall this 
<A NAME="574"></A>individual have any being or anything beyond himself on which he 
<A NAME="575"></A>depends?
<A NAME="576"></A><BR><BR>Call him man in his ideal, how earnest is he! Call him an abyss, 
<A NAME="577"></A>how deep is he! Call him Heaven, how vast is he!
<A NAME="578"></A><BR><BR>Who can know him, but he who is indeed quick in apprehension, clear 
<A NAME="579"></A>in discernment, of far-reaching intelligence, and all-embracing knowledge, 
<A NAME="580"></A>possessing all Heavenly virtue?
<A NAME="581"></A><BR><BR>It is said in the Book of Poetry, "Over her embroidered robe she 
<A NAME="582"></A>puts a plain single garment," intimating a dislike to the display of the 
<A NAME="583"></A>elegance of the former. Just so, it is the way of the superior man to prefer 
<A NAME="584"></A>the concealment of his virtue, while it daily becomes more illustrious, 
<A NAME="585"></A>and it is the way of the mean man to seek notoriety, while he daily goes 
<A NAME="586"></A>more and more to ruin. It is characteristic of the superior man, appearing 
<A NAME="587"></A>insipid, yet never to produce satiety; while showing a simple negligence, 
<A NAME="588"></A>yet to have his accomplishments recognized; while seemingly plain, yet 
<A NAME="589"></A>to be discriminating. He knows how what is distant lies in what is near. 
<A NAME="590"></A>He knows where the wind proceeds from. He knows how what is minute becomes 
<A NAME="591"></A>manifested. Such a one, we may be sure, will enter into 
<A NAME="592"></A>virtue.
<A NAME="593"></A><BR><BR>It is said in the Book of Poetry, "Although the fish sink and lie 
<A NAME="594"></A>at the bottom, it is still quite clearly seen." Therefore the superior 
<A NAME="595"></A>man examines his heart, that there may be nothing wrong there, and that 
<A NAME="596"></A>he may have no cause for dissatisfaction with himself. That wherein the 
<A NAME="597"></A>superior man cannot be equaled is simply this,-his work which other men 
<A NAME="598"></A>cannot see.
<A NAME="599"></A><BR><BR>It is said in the Book of Poetry, "Looked at in your apartment, 
<A NAME="600"></A>be there free from shame as being exposed to the light of Heaven." Therefore, 
<A NAME="601"></A>the superior man, even when he is not moving, has a feeling of reverence, 
<A NAME="602"></A>and while he speaks not, he has the feeling of truthfulness.
<A NAME="603"></A><BR><BR>It is said in the Book of Poetry, "In silence is the offering presented, 
<A NAME="604"></A>and the spirit approached to; there is not the slightest contention." Therefore 
<A NAME="605"></A>the superior man does not use rewards, and the people are stimulated to 
<A NAME="606"></A>virtue. He does not show anger, and the people are awed more than by hatchets 
<A NAME="607"></A>and battle-axes.
<A NAME="608"></A><BR><BR>It is said in the Book of Poetry, "What needs no display is virtue. 
<A NAME="609"></A>All the princes imitate it." Therefore, the superior man being sincere 
<A NAME="610"></A>and reverential, the whole world is conducted to a state of happy 
<A NAME="611"></A>tranquility.
<A NAME="612"></A><BR><BR>It is said in the Book of Poetry, "I regard with pleasure your 
<A NAME="613"></A>brilliant virtue, making no great display of itself in sounds and appearances." 
<A NAME="614"></A>The Master said, "Among the appliances to transform the people, sound and 
<A NAME="615"></A>appearances are but trivial influences. It is said in another ode, 'His 
<A NAME="616"></A>Virtue is light as a hair.' Still, a hair will admit of comparison as to 
<A NAME="617"></A>its size. 'The doings of the supreme Heaven have neither sound nor smell. 
<A NAME="618"></A>'That is perfect virtue."
