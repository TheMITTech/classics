<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Yen Yuan asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, "To subdue one's 
<A NAME="12"></A>self and return to propriety, is perfect virtue. If a man can for one day 
<A NAME="13"></A>subdue himself and return to propriety, an under heaven will ascribe perfect 
<A NAME="14"></A>virtue to him. Is the practice of perfect virtue from a man himself, or 
<A NAME="15"></A>is it from others?"
<A NAME="16"></A><BR><BR>Yen Yuan said, "I beg to ask the steps of that process." The Master 
<A NAME="17"></A>replied, "Look not at what is contrary to propriety; listen not to what 
<A NAME="18"></A>is contrary to propriety; speak not what is contrary to propriety; make 
<A NAME="19"></A>no movement which is contrary to propriety." Yen Yuan then said, "Though 
<A NAME="20"></A>I am deficient in intelligence and vigor, I will make it my business to 
<A NAME="21"></A>practice this lesson."
<A NAME="22"></A><BR><BR>Chung-kung asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, "It is, 
<A NAME="23"></A>when you go abroad, to behave to every one as if you were receiving a great 
<A NAME="24"></A>guest; to employ the people as if you were assisting at a great sacrifice; 
<A NAME="25"></A>not to do to others as you would not wish done to yourself; to have no 
<A NAME="26"></A>murmuring against you in the country, and none in the family." Chung-kung 
<A NAME="27"></A>said, "Though I am deficient in intelligence and vigor, I will make it 
<A NAME="28"></A>my business to practice this lesson."
<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR>Sze-ma Niu asked about perfect virtue.
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>The Master said, "The man of perfect virtue is cautious and slow in 
<A NAME="31"></A>his speech."
<A NAME="32"></A><BR><BR>"Cautious and slow in his speech!" said Niu;-"is this what is meant 
<A NAME="33"></A>by perfect virtue?" The Master said, "When a man feels the difficulty of 
<A NAME="34"></A>doing, can he be other than cautious and slow in speaking?"
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR>Sze-ma Niu asked about the superior man. The Master said, "The 
<A NAME="36"></A>superior man has neither anxiety nor fear."
<A NAME="37"></A><BR><BR>"Being without anxiety or fear!" said Nui;"does this constitute 
<A NAME="38"></A>what we call the superior man?"
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "When internal examination discovers nothing wrong, 
<A NAME="40"></A>what is there to be anxious about, what is there to 
<A NAME="41"></A>fear?"
<A NAME="42"></A><BR><BR>Sze-ma Niu, full of anxiety, said, "Other men all have their brothers, 
<A NAME="43"></A>I only have not."
<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-hsia said to him, "There is the following saying which I have 
<A NAME="45"></A>heard-'Death and life have their determined appointment; riches and honors 
<A NAME="46"></A>depend upon Heaven.'
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR>"Let the superior man never fail reverentially to order his own 
<A NAME="48"></A>conduct, and let him be respectful to others and observant of propriety:-then 
<A NAME="49"></A>all within the four seas will be his brothers. What has the superior man 
<A NAME="50"></A>to do with being distressed because he has no brothers?"
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-chang asked what constituted intelligence. The Master said, 
<A NAME="52"></A>"He with whom neither slander that gradually soaks into the mind, nor statements 
<A NAME="53"></A>that startle like a wound in the flesh, are successful may be called intelligent 
<A NAME="54"></A>indeed. Yea, he with whom neither soaking slander, nor startling statements, 
<A NAME="55"></A>are successful, may be called farseeing."
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-kung asked about government. The Master said, "The requisites 
<A NAME="57"></A>of government are that there be sufficiency of food, sufficiency of military 
<A NAME="58"></A>equipment, and the confidence of the people in their 
<A NAME="59"></A>ruler."
<A NAME="60"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-kung said, "If it cannot be helped, and one of these must 
<A NAME="61"></A>be dispensed with, which of the three should be foregone first?" "The military 
<A NAME="62"></A>equipment," said the Master.
<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-kung again asked, "If it cannot be helped, and one of the 
<A NAME="64"></A>remaining two must be dispensed with, which of them should be foregone?" 
<A NAME="65"></A>The Master answered, "Part with the food. From of old, death has been the 
<A NAME="66"></A>lot of an men; but if the people have no faith in their rulers, there is 
<A NAME="67"></A>no standing for the state."
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR>Chi Tsze-ch'ang said, "In a superior man it is only the substantial 
<A NAME="69"></A>qualities which are wanted;-why should we seek for ornamental 
<A NAME="70"></A>accomplishments?"
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-kung said, "Alas! Your words, sir, show you to be a superior 
<A NAME="72"></A>man, but four horses cannot overtake the tongue. Ornament is as substance; 
<A NAME="73"></A>substance is as ornament. The hide of a tiger or a leopard stripped of 
<A NAME="74"></A>its hair, is like the hide of a dog or a goat stripped of its 
<A NAME="75"></A>hair."
<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR>The Duke Ai inquired of Yu Zo, saying, "The year is one of scarcity, 
<A NAME="77"></A>and the returns for expenditure are not sufficient;-what is to be 
<A NAME="78"></A>done?"
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>Yu Zo replied to him, "Why not simply tithe the 
<A NAME="80"></A>people?"
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>"With two tenths, said the duke, "I find it not enough;-how could I 
<A NAME="82"></A>do with that system of one tenth?"
<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR>Yu Zo answered, "If the people have plenty, their prince will not 
<A NAME="84"></A>be left to want alone. If the people are in want, their prince cannot enjoy 
<A NAME="85"></A>plenty alone."
<A NAME="86"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-chang having asked how virtue was to be exalted, and delusions 
<A NAME="87"></A>to be discovered, the Master said, "Hold faithfulness and sincerity as 
<A NAME="88"></A>first principles, and be moving continually to what is right,-this is the 
<A NAME="89"></A>way to exalt one's virtue.
<A NAME="90"></A><BR><BR>"You love a man and wish him to live; you hate him and wish him 
<A NAME="91"></A>to die. Having wished him to live, you also wish him to die. This is a 
<A NAME="92"></A>case of delusion. 'It may not be on account of her being rich, yet you 
<A NAME="93"></A>come to make a difference.'"
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR>The Duke Ching, of Ch'i, asked Confucius about government. Confucius 
<A NAME="95"></A>replied, "There is government, when the prince is prince, and the minister 
<A NAME="96"></A>is minister; when the father is father, and the son is 
<A NAME="97"></A>son."
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR>"Good!" said the duke; "if, indeed, the prince be not prince, the 
<A NAME="99"></A>not minister, the father not father, and the son not son, although I have 
<A NAME="100"></A>my revenue, can I enjoy it?"
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Ah! it is Yu, who could with half a word settle 
<A NAME="102"></A>litigations!"
<A NAME="103"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-lu never slept over a promise.
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>The Master said, "In hearing litigations, I am like any other body. 
<A NAME="105"></A>What is necessary, however, is to cause the people to have no 
<A NAME="106"></A>litigations."
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-chang asked about government. The Master said, "The art of 
<A NAME="108"></A>governing is to keep its affairs before the mind without weariness, and 
<A NAME="109"></A>to practice them with undeviating consistency."
<A NAME="110"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "By extensively studying all learning, and keeping 
<A NAME="111"></A>himself under the restraint of the rules of propriety, one may thus likewise 
<A NAME="112"></A>not err from what is right."
<A NAME="113"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "The superior man seeks to perfect the admirable 
<A NAME="114"></A>qualities of men, and does not seek to perfect their bad qualities. The 
<A NAME="115"></A>mean man does the opposite of this."
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR>Chi K'ang asked Confucius about government. Confucius replied, 
<A NAME="117"></A>"To govern means to rectify. If you lead on the people with correctness, 
<A NAME="118"></A>who will dare not to be correct?"
<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR>Chi K'ang, distressed about the number of thieves in the state, 
<A NAME="120"></A>inquired of Confucius how to do away with them. Confucius said, "If you, 
<A NAME="121"></A>sir, were not covetous, although you should reward them to do it, they 
<A NAME="122"></A>would not steal."
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>Chi K'ang asked Confucius about government, saying, "What do you 
<A NAME="124"></A>say to killing the unprincipled for the good of the principled?" Confucius 
<A NAME="125"></A>replied, "Sir, in carrying on your government, why should you use killing 
<A NAME="126"></A>at all? Let your evinced desires be for what is good, and the people will 
<A NAME="127"></A>be good. The relation between superiors and inferiors is like that between 
<A NAME="128"></A>the wind and the grass. The grass must bend, when the wind blows across 
<A NAME="129"></A>it."
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-chang asked, "What must the officer be, who may be said to 
<A NAME="131"></A>be distinguished?"
<A NAME="132"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "What is it you call being 
<A NAME="133"></A>distinguished?"
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>Tsze-chang replied, "It is to be heard of through the state, to be 
<A NAME="135"></A>heard of throughout his clan."
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "That is notoriety, not distinction.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>"Now the man of distinction is solid and straightforward, and loves 
<A NAME="138"></A>righteousness. He examines people's words, and looks at their countenances. 
<A NAME="139"></A>He is anxious to humble himself to others. Such a man will be distinguished 
<A NAME="140"></A>in the country; he will be distinguished in his clan.
<A NAME="141"></A><BR><BR>"As to the man of notoriety, he assumes the appearance of virtue, 
<A NAME="142"></A>but his actions are opposed to it, and he rests in this character without 
<A NAME="143"></A>any doubts about himself. Such a man will be heard of in the country; he 
<A NAME="144"></A>will be heard of in the clan."
<A NAME="145"></A><BR><BR>Fan Ch'ih rambling with the Master under the trees about the rain 
<A NAME="146"></A>altars, said, "I venture to ask how to exalt virtue, to correct cherished 
<A NAME="147"></A>evil, and to discover delusions."
<A NAME="148"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Truly a good question!
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>"If doing what is to be done be made the first business, and success 
<A NAME="150"></A>a secondary consideration:-is not this the way to exalt virtue? To assail 
<A NAME="151"></A>one's own wickedness and not assail that of others;-is not this the way 
<A NAME="152"></A>to correct cherished evil? For a morning's anger to disregard one's own 
<A NAME="153"></A>life, and involve that of his parents;-is not this a case of 
<A NAME="154"></A>delusion?"
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR>Fan Ch'ih asked about benevolence. The Master said, "It is to love 
<A NAME="156"></A>all men." He asked about knowledge. The Master said, "It is to know all 
<A NAME="157"></A>men."
<A NAME="158"></A><BR><BR>Fan Ch'ih did not immediately understand these 
<A NAME="159"></A>answers.
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>The Master said, "Employ the upright and put aside all the crooked; 
<A NAME="161"></A>in this way the crooked can be made to be upright."
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR>Fan Ch'ih retired, and, seeing Tsze-hsia, he said to him, "A Little 
<A NAME="163"></A>while ago, I had an interview with our Master, and asked him about knowledge. 
<A NAME="164"></A>He said, 'Employ the upright, and put aside all the crooked;-in this way, 
<A NAME="165"></A>the crooked will be made to be upright.' What did he 
<A NAME="166"></A>mean?"
<A NAME="167"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-hsia said, "Truly rich is his saying!
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>"Shun, being in possession of the kingdom, selected from among all 
<A NAME="169"></A>the people, and employed Kai-yao-on which all who were devoid of virtue 
<A NAME="170"></A>disappeared. T'ang, being in possession of the kingdom, selected from among 
<A NAME="171"></A>all the people, and employed I Yin-and an who were devoid of virtue 
<A NAME="172"></A>disappeared."
<A NAME="173"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-kung asked about friendship. The Master said, "Faithfully 
<A NAME="174"></A>admonish your friend, and skillfully lead him on. If you find him impracticable, 
<A NAME="175"></A>stop. Do not disgrace yourself."
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR>The philosopher Tsang said, "The superior man on grounds of culture 
<A NAME="177"></A>meets with his friends, and by friendship helps his 
<A NAME="178"></A>virtue."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="179"></A><B>Part 13</B>

<A NAME="180"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-lu asked about government. The Master said, "Go before the 
<A NAME="181"></A>people with your example, and be laborious in their 
<A NAME="182"></A>affairs."
<A NAME="183"></A><BR><BR>He requested further instruction, and was answered, "Be not weary 
<A NAME="184"></A>in these things."
<A NAME="185"></A><BR><BR>Chung-kung, being chief minister to the head of the Chi family, 
<A NAME="186"></A>asked about government. The Master said, "Employ first the services of 
<A NAME="187"></A>your various officers, pardon small faults, and raise to office men of 
<A NAME="188"></A>virtue and talents."
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR>Chung-kung said, "How shall I know the men of virtue and talent, 
<A NAME="190"></A>so that I may raise them to office?" He was answered, "Raise to office 
<A NAME="191"></A>those whom you know. As to those whom you do not know, will others neglect 
<A NAME="192"></A>them?"
<A NAME="193"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-lu said, "The ruler of Wei has been waiting for you, in order 
<A NAME="194"></A>with you to administer the government. What will you consider the first 
<A NAME="195"></A>thing to be done?"
<A NAME="196"></A><BR><BR>The Master replied, "What is necessary is to rectify 
<A NAME="197"></A>names."
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>"So! indeed!" said Tsze-lu. "You are wide of the mark! Why must there 
<A NAME="199"></A>be such rectification?"
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "How uncultivated you are, Yu! A superior man, 
<A NAME="201"></A>in regard to what he does not know, shows a cautious 
<A NAME="202"></A>reserve.
<A NAME="203"></A><BR><BR>"If names be not correct, language is not in accordance with the 
<A NAME="204"></A>truth of things. If language be not in accordance with the truth of things, 
<A NAME="205"></A>affairs cannot be carried on to success.
<A NAME="206"></A><BR><BR>"When affairs cannot be carried on to success, proprieties and 
<A NAME="207"></A>music do not flourish. When proprieties and music do not flourish, punishments 
<A NAME="208"></A>will not be properly awarded. When punishments are not properly awarded, 
<A NAME="209"></A>the people do not know how to move hand or foot.
<A NAME="210"></A><BR><BR>"Therefore a superior man considers it necessary that the names 
<A NAME="211"></A>he uses may be spoken appropriately, and also that what he speaks may be 
<A NAME="212"></A>carried out appropriately. What the superior man requires is just that 
<A NAME="213"></A>in his words there may be nothing incorrect."
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR>Fan Ch'ih requested to be taught husbandry. The Master said, "I 
<A NAME="215"></A>am not so good for that as an old husbandman." He requested also to be 
<A NAME="216"></A>taught gardening, and was answered, "I am not so good for that as an old 
<A NAME="217"></A>gardener."
<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR>Fan Ch'ih having gone out, the Master said, "A small man, indeed, 
<A NAME="219"></A>is Fan Hsu! If a superior man love propriety, the people will not dare 
<A NAME="220"></A>not to be reverent. If he love righteousness, the people will not dare 
<A NAME="221"></A>not to submit to his example. If he love good faith, the people will not 
<A NAME="222"></A>dare not to be sincere. Now, when these things obtain, the people from 
<A NAME="223"></A>all quarters will come to him, bearing their children on their backs; what 
<A NAME="224"></A>need has he of a knowledge of husbandry?"
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Though a man may be able to recite the three 
<A NAME="226"></A>hundred odes, yet if, when intrusted with a governmental charge, he knows 
<A NAME="227"></A>not how to act, or if, when sent to any quarter on a mission, he cannot 
<A NAME="228"></A>give his replies unassisted, notwithstanding the extent of his learning, 
<A NAME="229"></A>of what practical use is it?"
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "When a prince's personal conduct is correct, 
<A NAME="231"></A>his government is effective without the issuing of orders. If his personal 
<A NAME="232"></A>conduct is not correct, he may issue orders, but they will not be 
<A NAME="233"></A>followed."
<A NAME="234"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "The governments of Lu and Wei are 
<A NAME="235"></A>brothers."
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>The Master said of Ching, a scion of the ducal family of Wei, that 
<A NAME="237"></A>he knew the economy of a family well. When he began to have means, he said, 
<A NAME="238"></A>"Ha! here is a collection-!" When they were a little increased, he said, 
<A NAME="239"></A>"Ha! this is complete!" When he had become rich, he said, "Ha! this is 
<A NAME="240"></A>admirable!"
<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR>When the Master went to Weil Zan Yu acted as driver of his 
<A NAME="242"></A>carriage.
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>The Master observed, "How numerous are the people!"
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>Yu said, "Since they are thus numerous, what more shall be done for 
<A NAME="245"></A>them?" "Enrich them, was the reply.
<A NAME="246"></A><BR><BR>"And when they have been enriched, what more shall be done?" The 
<A NAME="247"></A>Master said, "Teach them."
<A NAME="248"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "If there were any of the princes who would employ 
<A NAME="249"></A>me, in the course of twelve months, I should have done something considerable. 
<A NAME="250"></A>In three years, the government would be perfected."
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "'If good men were to govern a country in succession 
<A NAME="252"></A>for a hundred years, they would be able to transform the violently bad, 
<A NAME="253"></A>and dispense with capital punishments.' True indeed is this 
<A NAME="254"></A>saying!"
<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "If a truly royal ruler were to arise, it would 
<A NAME="256"></A>stir require a generation, and then virtue would prevail."
<A NAME="257"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "If a minister make his own conduct correct, what 
<A NAME="258"></A>difficulty will he have in assisting in government? If he cannot rectify 
<A NAME="259"></A>himself, what has he to do with rectifying others?"
<A NAME="260"></A><BR><BR>The disciple Zan returning from the court, the Master said to him, 
<A NAME="261"></A>"How are you so late?" He replied, "We had government business." The Master 
<A NAME="262"></A>said, "It must have been family affairs. If there had been government business, 
<A NAME="263"></A>though I am not now in office, I should have been consulted about 
<A NAME="264"></A>it."
<A NAME="265"></A><BR><BR>The Duke Ting asked whether there was a single sentence which could 
<A NAME="266"></A>make a country prosperous. Confucius replied, "Such an effect cannot be 
<A NAME="267"></A>expected from one sentence.
<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR>"There is a saying, however, which people have -'To be a prince 
<A NAME="269"></A>is difficult; to be a minister is not easy.'
<A NAME="270"></A><BR><BR>"If a ruler knows this,-the difficulty of being a prince,-may there 
<A NAME="271"></A>not be expected from this one sentence the prosperity of his 
<A NAME="272"></A>country?"
<A NAME="273"></A><BR><BR>The duke then said, "Is there a single sentence which can ruin 
<A NAME="274"></A>a country?" Confucius replied, "Such an effect as that cannot be expected 
<A NAME="275"></A>from one sentence. There is, however, the saying which people have-'I have 
<A NAME="276"></A>no pleasure in being a prince, but only in that no one can offer any opposition 
<A NAME="277"></A>to what I say!'
<A NAME="278"></A><BR><BR>"If a ruler's words be good, is it not also good that no one oppose 
<A NAME="279"></A>them? But if they are not good, and no one opposes them, may there not 
<A NAME="280"></A>be expected from this one sentence the ruin of his country?"
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR>The Duke of Sheh asked about government.
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>The Master said, "Good government obtains when those who are near are 
<A NAME="283"></A>made happy, and those who are far off are attracted."
<A NAME="284"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-hsia! being governor of Chu-fu, asked about government. The 
<A NAME="285"></A>Master said, "Do not be desirous to have things done quickly; do not look 
<A NAME="286"></A>at small advantages. Desire to have things done quickly prevents their 
<A NAME="287"></A>being done thoroughly. Looking at small advantages prevents great affairs 
<A NAME="288"></A>from being accomplished."
<A NAME="289"></A><BR><BR>The Duke of Sheh informed Confucius, saying, "Among us here there 
<A NAME="290"></A>are those who may be styled upright in their conduct. If their father have 
<A NAME="291"></A>stolen a sheep, they will bear witness to the fact."
<A NAME="292"></A><BR><BR>Confucius said, "Among us, in our part of the country, those who 
<A NAME="293"></A>are upright are different from this. The father conceals the misconduct 
<A NAME="294"></A>of the son, and the son conceals the misconduct of the father. Uprightness 
<A NAME="295"></A>is to be found in this."
<A NAME="296"></A><BR><BR>Fan Ch'ih asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, "It is, 
<A NAME="297"></A>in retirement, to be sedately grave; in the management of business, to 
<A NAME="298"></A>be reverently attentive; in intercourse with others, to be strictly sincere. 
<A NAME="299"></A>Though a man go among rude, uncultivated tribes, these qualities may not 
<A NAME="300"></A>be neglected."
<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-kung asked, saying, "What qualities must a man possess to 
<A NAME="302"></A>entitle him to be called an officer? The Master said, "He who in his conduct 
<A NAME="303"></A>of himself maintains a sense of shame, and when sent to any quarter will 
<A NAME="304"></A>not disgrace his prince's commission, deserves to be called an 
<A NAME="305"></A>officer."
<A NAME="306"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-kung pursued, "I venture to ask who may be placed in the next 
<A NAME="307"></A>lower rank?" And he was told, "He whom the circle of his relatives pronounce 
<A NAME="308"></A>to be filial, whom his fellow villagers and neighbors pronounce to be 
<A NAME="309"></A>fraternal."
<A NAME="310"></A><BR><BR>Again the disciple asked, "I venture to ask about the class still 
<A NAME="311"></A>next in order." The Master said, "They are determined to be sincere in 
<A NAME="312"></A>what they say, and to carry out what they do. They are obstinate little 
<A NAME="313"></A>men. Yet perhaps they may make the next class."
<A NAME="314"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-kung finally inquired, "Of what sort are those of the present 
<A NAME="315"></A>day, who engage in government?" The Master said "Pooh! they are so many 
<A NAME="316"></A>pecks and hampers, not worth being taken into account."
<A NAME="317"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Since I cannot get men pursuing the due medium, 
<A NAME="318"></A>to whom I might communicate my instructions, I must find the ardent and 
<A NAME="319"></A>the cautiously-decided. The ardent will advance and lay hold of truth; 
<A NAME="320"></A>the cautiously-decided will keep themselves from what is 
<A NAME="321"></A>wrong."
<A NAME="322"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "The people of the south have a saying -'A man 
<A NAME="323"></A>without constancy cannot be either a wizard or a doctor.' 
<A NAME="324"></A>Good!
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR>"Inconstant in his virtue, he will be visited with 
<A NAME="326"></A>disgrace."
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>The Master said, "This arises simply from not attending to the 
<A NAME="328"></A>prognostication."
<A NAME="329"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "The superior man is affable, but not adulatory; 
<A NAME="330"></A>the mean man is adulatory, but not affable."
<A NAME="331"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-kung asked, saying, "What do you say of a man who is loved 
<A NAME="332"></A>by all the people of his neighborhood?" The Master replied, "We may not 
<A NAME="333"></A>for that accord our approval of him." "And what do you say of him who is 
<A NAME="334"></A>hated by all the people of his neighborhood?" The Master said, "We may 
<A NAME="335"></A>not for that conclude that he is bad. It is better than either of these 
<A NAME="336"></A>cases that the good in the neighborhood love him, and the bad hate 
<A NAME="337"></A>him."
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "The superior man is easy to serve and difficult 
<A NAME="339"></A>to please. If you try to please him in any way which is not accordant with 
<A NAME="340"></A>right, he will not be pleased. But in his employment of men, he uses them 
<A NAME="341"></A>according to their capacity. The mean man is difficult to serve, and easy 
<A NAME="342"></A>to please. If you try to please him, though it be in a way which is not 
<A NAME="343"></A>accordant with right, he may be pleased. But in his employment of men, 
<A NAME="344"></A>he wishes them to be equal to everything."
<A NAME="345"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "The superior man has a dignified ease without 
<A NAME="346"></A>pride. The mean man has pride without a dignified ease."
<A NAME="347"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "The firm, the enduring, the simple, and the modest 
<A NAME="348"></A>are near to virtue."
<A NAME="349"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-lu asked, saying, "What qualities must a man possess to entitle 
<A NAME="350"></A>him to be called a scholar?" The Master said, "He must be thus,-earnest, 
<A NAME="351"></A>urgent, and bland:-among his friends, earnest and urgent; among his brethren, 
<A NAME="352"></A>bland."
<A NAME="353"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Let a good man teach the people seven years, 
<A NAME="354"></A>and they may then likewise be employed in war."
<A NAME="355"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "To lead an uninstructed people to war, is to 
<A NAME="356"></A>throw them away."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="357"></A><B>Part 14</B>

<A NAME="358"></A><BR><BR>Hsien asked what was shameful. The Master said, "When good government 
<A NAME="359"></A>prevails in a state, to be thinking only of salary; and, when bad government 
<A NAME="360"></A>prevails, to be thinking, in the same way, only of salary;-this is 
<A NAME="361"></A>shameful."
<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR>"When the love of superiority, boasting, resentments, and covetousness 
<A NAME="363"></A>are repressed, this may be deemed perfect virtue."
<A NAME="364"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "This may be regarded as the achievement of what 
<A NAME="365"></A>is difficult. But I do not know that it is to be deemed perfect 
<A NAME="366"></A>virtue."
<A NAME="367"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "The scholar who cherishes the love of comfort 
<A NAME="368"></A>is not fit to be deemed a scholar."
<A NAME="369"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "When good government prevails in a state, language 
<A NAME="370"></A>may be lofty and bold, and actions the same. When bad government prevails, 
<A NAME="371"></A>the actions may be lofty and bold, but the language may be with some 
<A NAME="372"></A>reserve."
<A NAME="373"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "The virtuous will be sure to speak correctly, 
<A NAME="374"></A>but those whose speech is good may not always be virtuous. Men of principle 
<A NAME="375"></A>are sure to be bold, but those who are bold may not always be men of 
<A NAME="376"></A>principle."
<A NAME="377"></A><BR><BR>Nan-kung Kwo, submitting an inquiry to Confucius, said, "I was 
<A NAME="378"></A>skillful at archery, and Ao could move a boat along upon the land, but 
<A NAME="379"></A>neither of them died a natural death. Yu and Chi personally wrought at 
<A NAME="380"></A>the toils of husbandry, and they became possessors of the kingdom." The 
<A NAME="381"></A>Master made no reply; but when Nan-kung Kwo went out, he said, "A superior 
<A NAME="382"></A>man indeed is this! An esteemer of virtue indeed is 
<A NAME="383"></A>this!"
<A NAME="384"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Superior men, and yet not always virtuous, there 
<A NAME="385"></A>have been, alas! But there never has been a mean man, and, at the same 
<A NAME="386"></A>time, virtuous."
<A NAME="387"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Can there be love which does not lead to strictness 
<A NAME="388"></A>with its object? Can there be loyalty which does not lead to the instruction 
<A NAME="389"></A>of its object?"
<A NAME="390"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "In preparing the governmental notifications, 
<A NAME="391"></A>P'i Shan first made the rough draft; Shi-shu examined and discussed its 
<A NAME="392"></A>contents; Tsze-yu, the manager of foreign intercourse, then polished the 
<A NAME="393"></A>style; and, finally, Tsze-ch'an of Tung-li gave it the proper elegance 
<A NAME="394"></A>and finish."
<A NAME="395"></A><BR><BR>Some one asked about Tsze-ch'an. The Master said, "He was a kind 
<A NAME="396"></A>man."
<A NAME="397"></A><BR><BR>He asked about Tsze-hsi. The Master said, "That man! That 
<A NAME="398"></A>man!"
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>He asked about Kwan Chung. "For him," said the Master, "the city of 
<A NAME="400"></A>Pien, with three hundred families, was taken from the chief of the Po family, 
<A NAME="401"></A>who did not utter a murmuring word, though, to the end of his life, he 
<A NAME="402"></A>had only coarse rice to eat."
<A NAME="403"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "To be poor without murmuring is difficult. To 
<A NAME="404"></A>be rich without being proud is easy."
<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Mang Kung-ch'o is more than fit to be chief officer 
<A NAME="406"></A>in the families of Chao and Wei, but he is not fit to be great officer 
<A NAME="407"></A>to either of the states Tang or Hsieh."
<A NAME="408"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-lu asked what constituted a COMPLETE man. The Master said, 
<A NAME="409"></A>"Suppose a man with the knowledge of Tsang Wu-chung, the freedom from covetousness 
<A NAME="410"></A>of Kung-ch'o, the bravery of Chwang of Pien, and the varied talents of 
<A NAME="411"></A>Zan Ch'iu; add to these the accomplishments of the rules of propriety and 
<A NAME="412"></A>music;-such a one might be reckoned a Complete man."
<A NAME="413"></A><BR><BR>He then added, "But what is the necessity for a complete man of 
<A NAME="414"></A>the present day to have all these things? The man, who in the view of gain, 
<A NAME="415"></A>thinks of righteousness; who in the view of danger is prepared to give 
<A NAME="416"></A>up his life; and who does not forget an old agreement however far back 
<A NAME="417"></A>it extends:-such a man may be reckoned a COMPLETE man."
<A NAME="418"></A><BR><BR>The Master asked Kung-ming Chia about Kung-shu Wan, saying, "Is 
<A NAME="419"></A>it true that your master speaks not, laughs not, and takes 
<A NAME="420"></A>not?"
<A NAME="421"></A><BR><BR>Kung-ming Chia replied, "This has arisen from the reporters going 
<A NAME="422"></A>beyond the truth.-My master speaks when it is the time to speak, and so 
<A NAME="423"></A>men do not get tired of his speaking. He laughs when there is occasion 
<A NAME="424"></A>to be joyful, and so men do not get tired of his laughing. He takes when 
<A NAME="425"></A>it is consistent with righteousness to do so, and so men do not get tired 
<A NAME="426"></A>of his taking." The Master said, "So! But is it so with 
<A NAME="427"></A>him?"
<A NAME="428"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Tsang Wu-chung, keeping possession of Fang, asked 
<A NAME="429"></A>of the duke of Lu to appoint a successor to him in his family. Although 
<A NAME="430"></A>it may be said that he was not using force with his sovereign, I believe 
<A NAME="431"></A>he was."
<A NAME="432"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "The duke Wan of Tsin was crafty and not upright. 
<A NAME="433"></A>The duke Hwan of Ch'i was upright and not crafty."
<A NAME="434"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-lu said, "The Duke Hwan caused his brother Chiu to be killed, 
<A NAME="435"></A>when Shao Hu died, with his master, but Kwan Chung did not die. May not 
<A NAME="436"></A>I say that he was wanting in virtue?"
<A NAME="437"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "The Duke Hwan assembled all the princes together, 
<A NAME="438"></A>and that not with weapons of war and chariots:-it was all through the influence 
<A NAME="439"></A>of Kwan Chung. Whose beneficence was like his? Whose beneficence was like 
<A NAME="440"></A>his?"
<A NAME="441"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-kung said, "Kwan Chung, I apprehend was wanting in virtue. 
<A NAME="442"></A>When the Duke Hwan caused his brother Chiu to be killed, Kwan Chung was 
<A NAME="443"></A>not able to die with him. Moreover, he became prime minister to 
<A NAME="444"></A>Hwan."
<A NAME="445"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Kwan Chung acted as prime minister to the Duke 
<A NAME="446"></A>Hwan made him leader of all the princes, and united and rectified the whole 
<A NAME="447"></A>kingdom. Down to the present day, the people enjoy the gifts which he conferred. 
<A NAME="448"></A>But for Kwan Chung, we should now be wearing our hair unbound, and the 
<A NAME="449"></A>lappets of our coats buttoning on the left side.
<A NAME="450"></A><BR><BR>"Will you require from him the small fidelity of common men and 
<A NAME="451"></A>common women, who would commit suicide in a stream or ditch, no one knowing 
<A NAME="452"></A>anything about them?"
<A NAME="453"></A><BR><BR>The great officer, Hsien, who had been family minister to Kung-shu 
<A NAME="454"></A>Wan, ascended to the prince's court in company with 
<A NAME="455"></A>Wan.
<A NAME="456"></A><BR><BR>The Master, having heard of it, said, "He deserved to be considered 
<A NAME="457"></A>WAN (the accomplished)."
<A NAME="458"></A><BR><BR>The Master was speaking about the unprincipled course of the duke 
<A NAME="459"></A>Ling of Weil when Ch'i K'ang said, "Since he is of such a character, how 
<A NAME="460"></A>is it he does not lose his state?"
<A NAME="461"></A><BR><BR>Confucius said, "The Chung-shu Yu has the superintendence of his 
<A NAME="462"></A>guests and of strangers; the litanist, T'o, has the management of his ancestral 
<A NAME="463"></A>temple; and Wang-sun Chia has the direction of the army and forces:-with 
<A NAME="464"></A>such officers as these, how should he lose his state?"
<A NAME="465"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "He who speaks without modesty will find it difficult 
<A NAME="466"></A>to make his words good."
<A NAME="467"></A><BR><BR>Chan Ch'ang murdered the Duke Chien of Ch'i.
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>Confucius bathed, went to court and informed the Duke Ai, saying, "Chan 
<A NAME="469"></A>Hang has slain his sovereign. I beg that you will undertake to punish 
<A NAME="470"></A>him."
<A NAME="471"></A><BR><BR>The duke said, "Inform the chiefs of the three families of 
<A NAME="472"></A>it."
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>Confucius retired, and said, "Following in the rear of the great officers, 
<A NAME="474"></A>I did not dare not to represent such a matter, and my prince says, "Inform 
<A NAME="475"></A>the chiefs of the three families of it."
<A NAME="476"></A><BR><BR>He went to the chiefs, and informed them, but they would not act. 
<A NAME="477"></A>Confucius then said, "Following in the rear of the great officers, I did 
<A NAME="478"></A>not dare not to represent such a matter."
<A NAME="479"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-lu asked how a ruler should be served. The Master said, "Do 
<A NAME="480"></A>not impose on him, and, moreover, withstand him to his 
<A NAME="481"></A>face."
<A NAME="482"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "The progress of the superior man is upwards; 
<A NAME="483"></A>the progress of the mean man is downwards."
<A NAME="484"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "In ancient times, men learned with a view to 
<A NAME="485"></A>their own improvement. Nowadays, men learn with a view to the approbation 
<A NAME="486"></A>of others."
<A NAME="487"></A><BR><BR>Chu Po-yu sent a messenger with friendly inquiries to 
<A NAME="488"></A>Confucius.
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>Confucius sat with him, and questioned him. "What," said he! "is your 
<A NAME="490"></A>master engaged in?" The messenger replied, "My master is anxious to make 
<A NAME="491"></A>his faults few, but he has not yet succeeded." He then went out, and the 
<A NAME="492"></A>Master said, "A messenger indeed! A messenger indeed!"
<A NAME="493"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "He who is not in any particular office has nothing 
<A NAME="494"></A>to do with plans for the administration of its duties."
<A NAME="495"></A><BR><BR>The philosopher Tsang said, "The superior man, in his thoughts, 
<A NAME="496"></A>does not go out of his place."
<A NAME="497"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "The superior man is modest in his speech, but 
<A NAME="498"></A>exceeds in his actions."
<A NAME="499"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "The way of the superior man is threefold, but 
<A NAME="500"></A>I am not equal to it. Virtuous, he is free from anxieties; wise, he is 
<A NAME="501"></A>free from perplexities; bold, he is free from fear.
<A NAME="502"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-kung said, "Master, that is what you yourself 
<A NAME="503"></A>say."
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>Tsze-kung was in the habit of comparing men together. The Master said, 
<A NAME="505"></A>"Tsze must have reached a high pitch of excellence! Now, I have not leisure 
<A NAME="506"></A>for this."
<A NAME="507"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "I will not be concerned at men's not knowing 
<A NAME="508"></A>me; I will be concerned at my own want of ability."
<A NAME="509"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "He who does not anticipate attempts to deceive 
<A NAME="510"></A>him, nor think beforehand of his not being believed, and yet apprehends 
<A NAME="511"></A>these things readily when they occur;-is he not a man of superior 
<A NAME="512"></A>worth?"
<A NAME="513"></A><BR><BR>Wei-shang Mau said to Confucius, "Ch'iu, how is it that you keep 
<A NAME="514"></A>roosting about? Is it not that you are an insinuating 
<A NAME="515"></A>talker?
<A NAME="516"></A><BR><BR>Confucius said, "I do not dare to play the part of such a talker, 
<A NAME="517"></A>but I hate obstinacy."
<A NAME="518"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "A horse is called a ch'i, not because of its 
<A NAME="519"></A>strength, but because of its other good qualities."
<A NAME="520"></A><BR><BR>Some one said, "What do you say concerning the principle that injury 
<A NAME="521"></A>should be recompensed with kindness?"
<A NAME="522"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "With what then will you recompense 
<A NAME="523"></A>kindness?"
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>"Recompense injury with justice, and recompense kindness with 
<A NAME="525"></A>kindness."
<A NAME="526"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Alas! there is no one that knows 
<A NAME="527"></A>me."
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>Tsze-kung said, "What do you mean by thus saying-that no one knows 
<A NAME="529"></A>you?" The Master replied, "I do not murmur against Heaven. I do not grumble 
<A NAME="530"></A>against men. My studies lie low, and my penetration rises high. But there 
<A NAME="531"></A>is Heaven;-that knows me!"
<A NAME="532"></A><BR><BR>The Kung-po Liao, having slandered Tsze-lu to Chi-sun, Tsze-fu 
<A NAME="533"></A>Ching-po informed Confucius of it, saying, "Our master is certainly being 
<A NAME="534"></A>led astray by the Kung-po Liao, but I have still power enough left to cut 
<A NAME="535"></A>Liao off, and expose his corpse in the market and in the 
<A NAME="536"></A>court."
<A NAME="537"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "If my principles are to advance, it is so ordered. 
<A NAME="538"></A>If they are to fall to the ground, it is so ordered. What can the Kung-po 
<A NAME="539"></A>Liao do where such ordering is concerned?"
<A NAME="540"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Some men of worth retire from the world. Some 
<A NAME="541"></A>retire from particular states. Some retire because of disrespectful looks. 
<A NAME="542"></A>Some retire because of contradictory language."
<A NAME="543"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Those who have done this are seven 
<A NAME="544"></A>men."
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>Tsze-lu happening to pass the night in Shih-man, the gatekeeper said 
<A NAME="546"></A>to him, "Whom do you come from?" Tsze-lu said, "From Mr. K'ung." "It is 
<A NAME="547"></A>he,-is it not?"-said the other, "who knows the impracticable nature of 
<A NAME="548"></A>the times and yet will be doing in them."
<A NAME="549"></A><BR><BR>The Master was playing, one day, on a musical stone in Weil when 
<A NAME="550"></A>a man carrying a straw basket passed door of the house where Confucius 
<A NAME="551"></A>was, and said, "His heart is full who so beats the musical 
<A NAME="552"></A>stone."
<A NAME="553"></A><BR><BR>A little while after, he added, "How contemptible is the one-ideaed 
<A NAME="554"></A>obstinacy those sounds display! When one is taken no notice of, he has 
<A NAME="555"></A>simply at once to give over his wish for public employment. 'Deep water 
<A NAME="556"></A>must be crossed with the clothes on; shallow water may be crossed with 
<A NAME="557"></A>the clothes held up.'"
<A NAME="558"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "How determined is he in his purpose! But this 
<A NAME="559"></A>is not difficult!"
<A NAME="560"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-chang said, "What is meant when the Shu says that Kao-tsung, 
<A NAME="561"></A>while observing the usual imperial mourning, was for three years without 
<A NAME="562"></A>speaking?"
<A NAME="563"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Why must Kao-tsung be referred to as an example 
<A NAME="564"></A>of this? The ancients all did so. When the sovereign died, the officers 
<A NAME="565"></A>all attended to their several duties, taking instructions from the prime 
<A NAME="566"></A>minister for three years."
<A NAME="567"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "When rulers love to observe the rules of propriety, 
<A NAME="568"></A>the people respond readily to the calls on them for 
<A NAME="569"></A>service."
<A NAME="570"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-lu asked what constituted the superior man. The Master said, 
<A NAME="571"></A>"The cultivation of himself in reverential carefulness." "And is this all?" 
<A NAME="572"></A>said Tsze-lu. "He cultivates himself so as to give rest to others," was 
<A NAME="573"></A>the reply. "And is this all?" again asked Tsze-lu. The Master said, "He 
<A NAME="574"></A>cultivates himself so as to give rest to all the people. He cultivates 
<A NAME="575"></A>himself so as to give rest to all the people:-even Yao and Shun were still 
<A NAME="576"></A>solicitous about this."
<A NAME="577"></A><BR><BR>Yuan Zang was squatting on his heels, and so waited the approach 
<A NAME="578"></A>of the Master, who said to him, "In youth not humble as befits a junior; 
<A NAME="579"></A>in manhood, doing nothing worthy of being handed down; and living on to 
<A NAME="580"></A>old age:-this is to be a pest." With this he hit him on the shank with 
<A NAME="581"></A>his staff.
<A NAME="582"></A><BR><BR>A youth of the village of Ch'ueh was employed by Confucius to carry 
<A NAME="583"></A>the messages between him and his visitors. Some one asked about him, saying, 
<A NAME="584"></A>"I suppose he has made great progress."
<A NAME="585"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "I observe that he is fond of occupying the seat 
<A NAME="586"></A>of a full-grown man; I observe that he walks shoulder to shoulder with 
<A NAME="587"></A>his elders. He is not one who is seeking to make progress in learning. 
<A NAME="588"></A>He wishes quickly to become a man."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="589"></A><B>Part 15</B>

<A NAME="590"></A><BR><BR>The Duke Ling of Wei asked Confucius about tactics. Confucius replied, 
<A NAME="591"></A>"I have heard all about sacrificial vessels, but I have not learned military 
<A NAME="592"></A>matters." On this, he took his departure the next day.
<A NAME="593"></A><BR><BR>When he was in Chan, their provisions were exhausted, and his followers 
<A NAME="594"></A>became so in that they were unable to rise.
<A NAME="595"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-lu, with evident dissatisfaction, said, "Has the superior 
<A NAME="596"></A>man likewise to endure in this way?" The Master said, "The superior man 
<A NAME="597"></A>may indeed have to endure want, but the mean man, when he is in want, gives 
<A NAME="598"></A>way to unbridled license."
<A NAME="599"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Ts'ze, you think, I suppose, that I am one who 
<A NAME="600"></A>learns many things and keeps them in memory?"
<A NAME="601"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-kung replied, "Yes,-but perhaps it is not 
<A NAME="602"></A>so?"
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>"No," was the answer; "I seek a unity all pervading."
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>The Master said, "Yu I those who know virtue are 
<A NAME="605"></A>few."
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>The Master said, "May not Shun be instanced as having governed efficiently 
<A NAME="607"></A>without exertion? What did he do? He did nothing but gravely and reverently 
<A NAME="608"></A>occupy his royal seat."
<A NAME="609"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-chang asked how a man should conduct himself, so as to be 
<A NAME="610"></A>everywhere appreciated.
<A NAME="611"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Let his words be sincere and truthful and his 
<A NAME="612"></A>actions honorable and careful;-such conduct may be practiced among the 
<A NAME="613"></A>rude tribes of the South or the North. If his words be not sincere and 
<A NAME="614"></A>truthful and his actions not honorable and carefull will he, with such 
<A NAME="615"></A>conduct, be appreciated, even in his neighborhood?
<A NAME="616"></A><BR><BR>"When he is standing, let him see those two things, as it were, 
<A NAME="617"></A>fronting him. When he is in a carriage, let him see them attached to the 
<A NAME="618"></A>yoke. Then may he subsequently carry them into practice."
<A NAME="619"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-chang wrote these counsels on the end of his 
<A NAME="620"></A>sash.
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>The Master said, "Truly straightforward was the historiographer Yu. 
<A NAME="622"></A>When good government prevailed in his state, he was like an arrow. When 
<A NAME="623"></A>bad government prevailed, he was like an arrow. A superior man indeed is 
<A NAME="624"></A>Chu Po-yu! When good government prevails in his state, he is to be found 
<A NAME="625"></A>in office. When bad government prevails, he can roll his principles up, 
<A NAME="626"></A>and keep them in his breast."
<A NAME="627"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "When a man may be spoken with, not to speak to 
<A NAME="628"></A>him is to err in reference to the man. When a man may not be spoken with, 
<A NAME="629"></A>to speak to him is to err in reference to our words. The wise err neither 
<A NAME="630"></A>in regard to their man nor to their words."
<A NAME="631"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "The determined scholar and the man of virtue 
<A NAME="632"></A>will not seek to live at the expense of injuring their virtue. They will 
<A NAME="633"></A>even sacrifice their lives to preserve their virtue 
<A NAME="634"></A>complete."
<A NAME="635"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-kung asked about the practice of virtue. The Master said, 
<A NAME="636"></A>"The mechanic, who wishes to do his work well, must first sharpen his tools. 
<A NAME="637"></A>When you are living in any state, take service with the most worthy among 
<A NAME="638"></A>its great officers, and make friends of the most virtuous among its 
<A NAME="639"></A>scholars."
<A NAME="640"></A><BR><BR>Yen Yuan asked how the government of a country should be 
<A NAME="641"></A>administered.
<A NAME="642"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Follow the seasons of Hsia.
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>"Ride in the state carriage of Yin.
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>"Wear the ceremonial cap of Chau.
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>"Let the music be the Shao with its pantomimes. Banish the songs of 
<A NAME="646"></A>Chang, and keep far from specious talkers. The songs of Chang are licentious; 
<A NAME="647"></A>specious talkers are dangerous."
<A NAME="648"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "If a man take no thought about what is distant, 
<A NAME="649"></A>he will find sorrow near at hand."
<A NAME="650"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "It is all over! I have not seen one who loves 
<A NAME="651"></A>virtue as he loves beauty."
<A NAME="652"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Was not Tsang Wan like one who had stolen his 
<A NAME="653"></A>situation? He knew the virtue and the talents of Hui of Liu-hsia, and yet 
<A NAME="654"></A>did not procure that he should stand with him in court."
<A NAME="655"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "He who requires much from himself and little 
<A NAME="656"></A>from others, will keep himself from being the object of 
<A NAME="657"></A>resentment."
<A NAME="658"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "When a man is not in the habit of saying-'What 
<A NAME="659"></A>shall I think of this? What shall I think of this?' I can indeed do nothing 
<A NAME="660"></A>with him!"
<A NAME="661"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "When a number of people are together, for a whole 
<A NAME="662"></A>day, without their conversation turning on righteousness, and when they 
<A NAME="663"></A>are fond of carrying out the suggestions of a small shrewdness;-theirs 
<A NAME="664"></A>is indeed a hard case."
<A NAME="665"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "The superior man in everything considers righteousness 
<A NAME="666"></A>to be essential. He performs it according to the rules of propriety. He 
<A NAME="667"></A>brings it forth in humility. He completes it with sincerity. This is indeed 
<A NAME="668"></A>a superior man."
<A NAME="669"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "The superior man is distressed by his want of 
<A NAME="670"></A>ability. He is not distressed by men's not knowing him."
<A NAME="671"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "The superior man dislikes the thought of his 
<A NAME="672"></A>name not being mentioned after his death."
<A NAME="673"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "What the superior man seeks, is in himself. What 
<A NAME="674"></A>the mean man seeks, is in others."
<A NAME="675"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "The superior man is dignified, but does not wrangle. 
<A NAME="676"></A>He is sociable, but not a partisan."
<A NAME="677"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "The superior man does not promote a man simply 
<A NAME="678"></A>on account of his words, nor does he put aside good words because of the 
<A NAME="679"></A>man."
<A NAME="680"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-kung asked, saying, "Is there one word which may serve as 
<A NAME="681"></A>a rule of practice for all one's life?" The Master said, "Is not Reciprocity 
<A NAME="682"></A>such a word? What you do not want done to yourself, do not do to 
<A NAME="683"></A>others."
<A NAME="684"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "In my dealings with men, whose evil do I blame, 
<A NAME="685"></A>whose goodness do I praise, beyond what is proper? If I do sometimes exceed 
<A NAME="686"></A>in praise, there must be ground for it in my examination of the 
<A NAME="687"></A>individual.
<A NAME="688"></A><BR><BR>"This people supplied the ground why the three dynasties pursued 
<A NAME="689"></A>the path of straightforwardness."
<A NAME="690"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Even in my early days, a historiographer would 
<A NAME="691"></A>leave a blank in his text, and he who had a horse would lend him to another 
<A NAME="692"></A>to ride. Now, alas! there are no such things."
<A NAME="693"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Specious words confound virtue. Want of forbearance 
<A NAME="694"></A>in small matters confounds great plans."
<A NAME="695"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "When the multitude hate a man, it is necessary 
<A NAME="696"></A>to examine into the case. When the multitude like a man, it is necessary 
<A NAME="697"></A>to examine into the case."
<A NAME="698"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "A man can enlarge the principles which he follows; 
<A NAME="699"></A>those principles do not enlarge the man."
<A NAME="700"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "To have faults and not to reform them,-this, 
<A NAME="701"></A>indeed, should be pronounced having faults."
<A NAME="702"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "I have been the whole day without eating, and 
<A NAME="703"></A>the whole night without sleeping:-occupied with thinking. It was of no 
<A NAME="704"></A>use. better plan is to learn."
<A NAME="705"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "The object of the superior man is truth. Food 
<A NAME="706"></A>is not his object. There is plowing;-even in that there is sometimes want. 
<A NAME="707"></A>So with learning;-emolument may be found in it. The superior man is anxious 
<A NAME="708"></A>lest he should not get truth; he is not anxious lest poverty should come 
<A NAME="709"></A>upon him."
<A NAME="710"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "When a man's knowledge is sufficient to attain, 
<A NAME="711"></A>and his virtue is not sufficient to enable him to hold, whatever he may 
<A NAME="712"></A>have gained, he will lose again.
<A NAME="713"></A><BR><BR>"When his knowledge is sufficient to attain, and he has virtue 
<A NAME="714"></A>enough to hold fast, if he cannot govern with dignity, the people will 
<A NAME="715"></A>not respect him.
<A NAME="716"></A><BR><BR>"When his knowledge is sufficient to attain, and he has virtue 
<A NAME="717"></A>enough to hold fast; when he governs also with dignity, yet if he try to 
<A NAME="718"></A>move the people contrary to the rules of propriety:-full excellence is 
<A NAME="719"></A>not reached."
<A NAME="720"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "The superior man cannot be known in little matters; 
<A NAME="721"></A>but he may be intrusted with great concerns. The small man may not be intrusted 
<A NAME="722"></A>with great concerns, but he may be known in little matters."
<A NAME="723"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Virtue is more to man than either water or fire. 
<A NAME="724"></A>I have seen men die from treading on water and fire, but I have never seen 
<A NAME="725"></A>a man die from treading the course of virtue."
<A NAME="726"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Let every man consider virtue as what devolves 
<A NAME="727"></A>on himself. He may not yield the performance of it even to his 
<A NAME="728"></A>teacher."
<A NAME="729"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "The superior man is correctly firm, and not firm 
<A NAME="730"></A>merely."
<A NAME="731"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "A minister, in serving his prince, reverently 
<A NAME="732"></A>discharges his duties, and makes his emolument a secondary 
<A NAME="733"></A>consideration."
<A NAME="734"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "In teaching there should be no distinction of 
<A NAME="735"></A>classes."
<A NAME="736"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Those whose courses are different cannot lay 
<A NAME="737"></A>plans for one another."
<A NAME="738"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "In language it is simply required that it convey 
<A NAME="739"></A>the meaning."
<A NAME="740"></A><BR><BR>The music master, Mien, having called upon him, when they came 
<A NAME="741"></A>to the steps, the Master said, "Here are the steps." When they came to 
<A NAME="742"></A>the mat for the guest to sit upon, he said, "Here is the mat." When all 
<A NAME="743"></A>were seated, the Master informed him, saying, "So and so is here; so and 
<A NAME="744"></A>so is here."
<A NAME="745"></A><BR><BR>The music master, Mien, having gone out, Tsze-chang asked, saying. 
<A NAME="746"></A>"Is it the rule to tell those things to the music master?"
<A NAME="747"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Yes. This is certainly the rule for those who 
<A NAME="748"></A>lead the blind."
