</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR><B>Part 1</B> 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Master &quot;Is it not pleasant to
learn with a constant perseverance and application? 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&quot;Is it not delightful to have
friends coming from distant quarters?</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&quot;Is he not a man of complete
virtue, who feels no discomposure though men may take no note of
him?&quot; 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The philosopher Yu said, &quot;They are
few who, being filial and fraternal, are fond of offending against
their superiors. There have been none, who, not liking to offend
against their superiors, have been fond of stirring up confusion. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&quot;The superior man bends his
attention to what is radical. That being established, all practical
courses naturally grow up. Filial piety and fraternal submission,-are
they not the root of all benevolent actions?&quot; 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Master said, &quot;Fine words and
an insinuating appearance are seldom associated with true virtue.&quot;
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The philosopher Tsang said, &quot;I
daily examine myself on three points:-whether, in transacting
business for others, I may have been not faithful;-whether, in
intercourse with friends, I may have been not sincere;-whether I may
have not mastered and practiced the instructions of my teacher.&quot;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Master said, &quot;To rule a
country of a thousand chariots, there must be reverent attention to
business, and sincerity; economy in expenditure, and love for men;
and the employment of the people at the proper seasons.&quot; 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Master said, &quot;A youth, when at
home, should be filial, and, abroad, respectful to his elders. He
should be earnest and truthful. He should overflow in love to all,
and cultivate the friendship of the good. When he has time and
opportunity, after the performance of these things, he should employ
them in polite studies.&quot; 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tsze-hsia said, &quot;If a man
withdraws his mind from the love of beauty, and applies it as
sincerely to the love of the virtuous; if, in serving his parents, he
can exert his utmost strength; if, in serving his prince, he can
devote his life; if, in his intercourse with his friends, his words
are sincere:-although men say that he has not learned, I will
certainly say that he has. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Master said, &quot;If the scholar
be not grave, he will not call forth any veneration, and his learning
will not be solid. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&quot;Hold faithfulness and sincerity
as first principles. &quot;Have no friends not equal to yourself.
&quot;When you have faults, do not fear to abandon them.&quot; The
philosopher Tsang said, &quot;Let there be a careful attention to
perform the funeral rites to parents, and let them be followed when
long gone with the ceremonies of sacrifice;-then the virtue of the
people will resume its proper excellence.&quot; 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tsze-ch'in asked Tsze-kung saying,
&quot;When our master comes to any country, he does not fail to learn
all about its government. Does he ask his information? or is it given
to him?&quot; 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tsze-kung said, &quot;Our master is
benign, upright, courteous, temperate, and complaisant and thus he
gets his information. The master's mode of asking information,-is it
not different from that of other men?&quot;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Master said, &quot;While a man's
father is alive, look at the bent of his will; when his father is
dead, look at his conduct. If for three years he does not alter from
the way of his father, he may be called filial.&quot; 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The philosopher Yu said, &quot;In
practicing the rules of propriety, a natural ease is to be prized. In
the ways prescribed by the ancientkings, this is the excellent
quality, and in things small and great we follow them. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&quot;Yet it is not to be observed in
all cases. If one, knowing how such ease should be prized, manifests
it, without regulating it by the rules of propriety, this likewise is
not to be done.&quot; 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The philosopher Yu said, &quot;When
agreements are made according to what is right, what is spoken can be
made good. When respect is shown according to what is proper, one
keeps far from shame and disgrace. When the parties upon whom a man
leans are proper persons to be intimate with, he can make them his
guides and masters.&quot; 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Master said, &quot;He who aims to
be a man of complete virtue in his food does not seek to gratify his
appetite, nor in his dwelling place does he seek the appliances of
ease; he is earnest in what he is doing, and careful in his speech;
he frequents the company of men of principle that he may be
rectified:-such a person may be said indeed to love to learn.&quot; 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tsze-kung said, &quot;What do you
pronounce concerning the poor man who yet does not flatter, and the
rich man who is not proud?&quot; The Master replied, &quot;They will
do; but they are not equal to him, who, though poor, is yet cheerful,
and to him, who, though rich, loves the rules of propriety.&quot; 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tsze-kung replied, &quot;It is said in
the Book of Poetry, 'As you cut and then file, as you carve and then
polish.'-The meaning is the same, I apprehend, as that which you have
just expressed.&quot; 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Master said, &quot;With one like
Ts'ze, I can begin to talk about the odes. I told him one point, and
he knew its proper sequence.&quot;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Master said, &quot;I will not be
afflicted at men's not knowing me; I will be afflicted that I do not
know men.&quot; 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Part 2</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Master said, &quot;He who exercises
government by means of his virtue may be compared to the north polar
star, which keeps its place and all the stars turn towards it.&quot; 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Master said, &quot;In the Book of
Poetry are three hundred pieces, but the design of them all may be
embraced in one sentence 'Having no depraved thoughts.'&quot; 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Master said, &quot;If the people be
led by laws, and uniformity sought to be given them by punishments,
they will try to avoid the punishment, but have no sense of shame. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&quot;If they be led by virtue, and
uniformity sought to be given them by the rules of propriety, they
will have the sense of shame, and moreover will become good.&quot; 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Master said, &quot;At fifteen, I
had my mind bent on learning.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&quot;At thirty, I stood firm. &quot;At
forty, I had no doubts. &quot;At fifty, I knew the decrees of Heaven.
&quot;At sixty, my ear was an obedient organ for the reception of
truth.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&quot;At seventy, I could follow what
my heart desired, without transgressing what was right.&quot; 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mang I asked what filial piety was. The
Master said, &quot;It is not being disobedient.&quot; 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon after, as Fan Ch'ih was driving
him, the Master told him, saying, &quot;Mang-sun asked me what filial
piety was, and I answered him,-'not being disobedient.'&quot; 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fan Ch'ih said, &quot;What did you
mean?&quot; The Master replied, &quot;That parents, when alive, be
served according to propriety; that, when dead, they should be buried
according to propriety; and that they should be sacrificed to
according to propriety.&quot; 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mang Wu asked what filial piety was.
The Master said, &quot;Parents are anxious lest their children should
be sick.&quot; 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tsze-yu asked what filial piety was.
The Master said, &quot;The filial piety nowadays means the support of
one's parents. But dogs and horses likewise are able to do something
in the way of support;-without reverence, what is there to
distinguish the one support given from the other?&quot;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tsze-hsia asked what filial piety was.
The Master said, &quot;The difficulty is with the countenance. If,
when their elders have any troublesome affairs, the young take the
toil of them, and if, when the young have wine and food, they set
them before their elders, is THIS to be considered filial piety?&quot;
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Master said, &quot;I have talked
with Hui for a whole day, and he has not made any objection to
anything I said;-as if he were stupid. He has retired, and I have
examined his conduct when away from me, and found him able to
illustrate my teachings. Hui!-He is not stupid.&quot;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Master said, &quot;See what a man
does. &quot;Mark his motives. &quot;Examine in what things he rests.
&quot;How can a man conceal his character? How can a man conceal his
character?&quot;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Master said, &quot;If a man keeps
cherishing his old knowledge, so as continually to be acquiring new,
he may be a teacher of others.&quot;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Master said, &quot;The accomplished
scholar is not a utensil.&quot;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tsze-kung asked what constituted the
superior man. The Master said, &quot;He acts before he speaks, and
afterwards speaks according to his actions.&quot; 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Master said, &quot;The superior man
is catholic and not partisan. The mean man is partisan and not
catholic.&quot; 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Master said, &quot;Learning without
thought is labor lost; thought without learning is perilous.&quot; 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Master said, &quot;The study of
strange doctrines is injurious indeed!&quot;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Master said, &quot;Yu, shall I
teach you what knowledge is? When you know a thing, to hold that you
know it; and when you do not know a thing, to allow that you do not
know it;-this is knowledge.&quot;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tsze-chang was learning with a view to
official emolument.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Master said, &quot;Hear much and
put aside the points of which you stand in doubt, while you speak
cautiously at the same time of the others:-then you will afford few
occasions for blame. See much and put aside the things which seem
perilous, while you are cautious at the same time in carrying the
others into practice: then you will have few occasions for
repentance. When one gives few occasions for blame in his words, and
few occasions for repentance in his conduct, he is in the way to get
emolument.&quot; 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Duke Ai asked, saying, &quot;What
should be done in order to secure the submission of the people?&quot;
Confucius replied, &quot;Advance the upright and set aside the
crooked, then the people will submit. Advance the crooked and set
aside the upright, then the people will not submit.&quot;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chi K'ang asked how to cause the people
to reverence their ruler, to be faithful to him, and to go on to
nerve themselves to virtue. The Master said, &quot;Let him preside
over them with gravity;-then they will reverence him. Let him be
final and kind to all;-then they will be faithful to him. Let him
advance the good and teach the incompetent;-then they will eagerly
seek to be virtuous.&quot; 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some one addressed Confucius, saying,
&quot;Sir, why are you not engaged in the government?&quot; 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Master said, &quot;What does the
Shu-ching say of filial piety?-'You are final, you discharge your
brotherly duties. These qualities are displayed in government.' This
then also constitutes the exercise of government. Why must there be
THAT-making one be in the government?&quot;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Master said, &quot;I do not know
how a man without truthfulness is to get on. How can a large carriage
be made to go without the crossbar for yoking the oxen to, or a small
carriage without the arrangement for yoking the horses?&quot; 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tsze-chang asked whether the affairs of
ten ages after could be known.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Confucius said, &quot;The Yin dynasty
followed the regulations of the Hsia: wherein it took from or added
to them may be known. The Chau dynasty has followed the regulations
of Yin: wherein it took from or added to them may be known. Some
other may follow the Chau, but though it should be at the distance of
a hundred ages, its affairs may be known.&quot;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Master said, &quot;For a man to
sacrifice to a spirit which does not belong to him is flattery. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&quot;To see what is right and not to
do it is want of courage.&quot;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Part 3</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Confucius said of the head of the Chi
family, who had eight rows of pantomimes in his area, &quot;If he can
bear to do this, what may he not bear to do?&quot; 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three families used the Yungode,
while the vessels were being removed, at the conclusion of the
sacrifice. The Master said, &quot;'Assisting are the princes;-the son
of heaven looks profound and grave';-what application can these words
have in the hall of the three families?&quot;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Master said, &quot;If a man be
without the virtues proper to humanity, what has he to do with the
rites of propriety? If a man be without the virtues proper to
humanity, what has he to do with music?&quot;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lin Fang asked what was the first thing
to be attended to in ceremonies.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Master said, &quot;A great question
indeed! &quot;In festive ceremonies, it is better to be sparing than
extravagant. In the ceremonies of mourning, it is better that there
be deep sorrow than in minute attention to observances.&quot; 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Master said, &quot;The rude tribes
of the east and north have their princes, and are not like the States
of our great land which are without them.&quot; 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The chief of the Chi family was about
to sacrifice to the T'ai mountain. The Master said to Zan Yu, &quot;Can
you not save him from this?&quot; He answered, &quot;I cannot.&quot;
Confucius said, &quot;Alas! will you say that the T'ai mountain is
not so discerning as Lin Fang?&quot; 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Master said, &quot;The student of
virtue has no contentions. If it be said he cannot avoid them, shall
this be in archery? But he bows complaisantly to his competitors;
thus he ascends the hall, descends, and exacts the forfeit of
drinking. In his contention, he is still the Chun-tsze.&quot; 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tsze-hsia asked, saying, &quot;What is
the meaning of the passage-'The pretty dimples of her artful smile!
The well-defined black and white of her eye! The plain ground for the
colors?'&quot; 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Master said, &quot;Po-i and
Shu-ch'i did not keep the former wickednesses of men in mind, and
hence the resentments directed towards them were few.&quot;

sir, to hear your wishes.&quot; The Master said, &quot;They are, in
regard to the aged, to give them rest; in regard to friends, to show
them sincerity; in regard to the young, to treat them tenderly.&quot;

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chung-kung said, &quot;If a man cherish
in himself a reverential feeling of the necessity of attention to
business, though he may be easy in small matters in his government of
the people, that may be allowed. But if he cherish in himself that
easy feeling, and also carry it out in his practice, is not such an
easymode of procedure excessive?&quot;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

to be employed as an officer of government?&quot; and was answered,
&quot;Ts'ze is a man of intelligence; what difficulty would he find

affected by it. Admirable indeed was the virtue of Hui!&quot;

duties due to men, and, while respecting spiritual beings, to keep
