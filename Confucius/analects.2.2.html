<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>The Master said, "A transmitter and not a maker, believing in and loving 
<A NAME="12"></A>the ancients, I venture to compare myself with our old 
<A NAME="13"></A>P'ang."
<A NAME="14"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "The silent treasuring up of knowledge; learning 
<A NAME="15"></A>without satiety; and instructing others without being wearied:-which one 
<A NAME="16"></A>of these things belongs to me?"
<A NAME="17"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "The leaving virtue without proper cultivation; 
<A NAME="18"></A>the not thoroughly discussing what is learned; not being able to move towards 
<A NAME="19"></A>righteousness of which a knowledge is gained; and not being able to change 
<A NAME="20"></A>what is not good:-these are the things which occasion me 
<A NAME="21"></A>solicitude."
<A NAME="22"></A><BR><BR>When the Master was unoccupied with business, his manner was easy, 
<A NAME="23"></A>and he looked pleased.
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Extreme is my decay. For a long time, I have 
<A NAME="25"></A>not dreamed, as I was wont to do, that I saw the duke of 
<A NAME="26"></A>Chau."
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Let the will be set on the path of 
<A NAME="28"></A>duty.
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>"Let every attainment in what is good be firmly 
<A NAME="30"></A>grasped.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>"Let perfect virtue be accorded with.
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>"Let relaxation and enjoyment be found in the polite 
<A NAME="33"></A>arts."
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>The Master said, "From the man bringing his bundle of dried flesh for 
<A NAME="35"></A>my teaching upwards, I have never refused instruction to any 
<A NAME="36"></A>one."
<A NAME="37"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "I do not open up the truth to one who is not 
<A NAME="38"></A>eager to get knowledge, nor help out any one who is not anxious to explain 
<A NAME="39"></A>himself. When I have presented one corner of a subject to any one, and 
<A NAME="40"></A>he cannot from it learn the other three, I do not repeat my 
<A NAME="41"></A>lesson."
<A NAME="42"></A><BR><BR>When the Master was eating by the side of a mourner, he never ate 
<A NAME="43"></A>to the full.
<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR>He did not sing on the same day in which he had been 
<A NAME="45"></A>weeping.
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>The Master said to Yen Yuan, "When called to office, to undertake its 
<A NAME="47"></A>duties; when not so called, to he retired;-it is only I and you who have 
<A NAME="48"></A>attained to this."
<A NAME="49"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-lu said, "If you had the conduct of the armies of a great 
<A NAME="50"></A>state, whom would you have to act with you?"
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "I would not have him to act with me, who will 
<A NAME="52"></A>unarmed attack a tiger, or cross a river without a boat, dying without 
<A NAME="53"></A>any regret. My associate must be the man who proceeds to action full of 
<A NAME="54"></A>solicitude, who is fond of adjusting his plans, and then carries them into 
<A NAME="55"></A>execution."
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "If the search for riches is sure to be successful, 
<A NAME="57"></A>though I should become a groom with whip in hand to get them, I will do 
<A NAME="58"></A>so. As the search may not be successful, I will follow after that which 
<A NAME="59"></A>I love."
<A NAME="60"></A><BR><BR>The things in reference to which the Master exercised the greatest 
<A NAME="61"></A>caution were-fasting, war, and sickness.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR>When the Master was in Ch'i, he heard the Shao, and for three months 
<A NAME="63"></A>did not know the taste of flesh. "I did not think'" he said, "that music 
<A NAME="64"></A>could have been made so excellent as this."
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR>Yen Yu said, "Is our Master for the ruler of Wei?" Tsze-kung said, 
<A NAME="66"></A>"Oh! I will ask him."
<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR>He went in accordingly, and said, "What sort of men were Po-i and 
<A NAME="68"></A>Shu-ch'i?" "They were ancient worthies," said the Master. "Did they have 
<A NAME="69"></A>any repinings because of their course?" The Master again replied, "They 
<A NAME="70"></A>sought to act virtuously, and they did so; what was there for them to repine 
<A NAME="71"></A>about?" On this, Tsze-kung went out and said, "Our Master is not for 
<A NAME="72"></A>him."
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "With coarse rice to eat, with water to drink, 
<A NAME="74"></A>and my bended arm for a pillow;-I have still joy in the midst of these 
<A NAME="75"></A>things. Riches and honors acquired by unrighteousness, are to me as a floating 
<A NAME="76"></A>cloud."
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "If some years were added to my life, I would 
<A NAME="78"></A>give fifty to the study of the Yi, and then I might come to be without 
<A NAME="79"></A>great faults."
<A NAME="80"></A><BR><BR>The Master's frequent themes of discourse were-the Odes, the History, 
<A NAME="81"></A>and the maintenance of the Rules of Propriety. On all these he frequently 
<A NAME="82"></A>discoursed.
<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR>The Duke of Sheh asked Tsze-lu about Confucius, and Tsze-lu did 
<A NAME="84"></A>not answer him.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Why did you not say to him,-He is simply a man, 
<A NAME="86"></A>who in his eager pursuit of knowledge forgets his food, who in the joy 
<A NAME="87"></A>of its attainment forgets his sorrows, and who does not perceive that old 
<A NAME="88"></A>age is coming on?"
<A NAME="89"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "I am not one who was born in the possession of 
<A NAME="90"></A>knowledge; I am one who is fond of antiquity, and earnest in seeking it 
<A NAME="91"></A>there."
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR>The subjects on which the Master did not talk, were-extraordinary 
<A NAME="93"></A>things, feats of strength, disorder, and spiritual beings.
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "When I walk along with two others, they may serve 
<A NAME="95"></A>me as my teachers. I will select their good qualities and follow them, 
<A NAME="96"></A>their bad qualities and avoid them."
<A NAME="97"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Heaven produced the virtue that is in me. Hwan 
<A NAME="98"></A>T'ui-what can he do to me?"
<A NAME="99"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Do you think, my disciples, that I have any concealments? 
<A NAME="100"></A>I conceal nothing from you. There is nothing which I do that is not shown 
<A NAME="101"></A>to you, my disciples; that is my way."
<A NAME="102"></A><BR><BR>There were four things which the Master taught,-letters, ethics, 
<A NAME="103"></A>devotion of soul, and truthfulness.
<A NAME="104"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "A sage it is not mine to see; could I see a man 
<A NAME="105"></A>of real talent and virtue, that would satisfy me."
<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "A good man it is not mine to see; could I see 
<A NAME="107"></A>a man possessed of constancy, that would satisfy me.
<A NAME="108"></A><BR><BR>"Having not and yet affecting to have, empty and yet affecting 
<A NAME="109"></A>to be full, straitened and yet affecting to be at ease:-it is difficult 
<A NAME="110"></A>with such characteristics to have constancy."
<A NAME="111"></A><BR><BR>The Master angled,-but did not use a net. He shot,-but not at birds 
<A NAME="112"></A>perching.
<A NAME="113"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "There may be those who act without knowing why. 
<A NAME="114"></A>I do not do so. Hearing much and selecting what is good and following it; 
<A NAME="115"></A>seeing much and keeping it in memory: this is the second style of 
<A NAME="116"></A>knowledge."
<A NAME="117"></A><BR><BR>It was difficult to talk profitably and reputably with the people 
<A NAME="118"></A>of Hu-hsiang, and a lad of that place having had an interview with the 
<A NAME="119"></A>Master, the disciples doubted.
<A NAME="120"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "I admit people's approach to me without committing 
<A NAME="121"></A>myself as to what they may do when they have retired. Why must one be so 
<A NAME="122"></A>severe? If a man purify himself to wait upon me, I receive him so purified, 
<A NAME="123"></A>without guaranteeing his past conduct."
<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Is virtue a thing remote? I wish to be virtuous, 
<A NAME="125"></A>and lo! virtue is at hand."
<A NAME="126"></A><BR><BR>The minister of crime of Ch'an asked whether the duke Chao knew 
<A NAME="127"></A>propriety, and Confucius said, "He knew propriety."
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR>Confucius having retired, the minister bowed to Wu-ma Ch'i to come 
<A NAME="129"></A>forward, and said, "I have heard that the superior man is not a partisan. 
<A NAME="130"></A>May the superior man be a partisan also? The prince married a daughter 
<A NAME="131"></A>of the house of WU, of the same surname with himself, and called her,-'The 
<A NAME="132"></A>elder Tsze of Wu.' If the prince knew propriety, who does not know 
<A NAME="133"></A>it?"
<A NAME="134"></A><BR><BR>Wu-ma Ch'i reported these remarks, and the Master said, "I am fortunate! 
<A NAME="135"></A>If I have any errors, people are sure to know them."
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>When the Master was in company with a person who was singing, if 
<A NAME="137"></A>he sang well, he would make him repeat the song, while he accompanied it 
<A NAME="138"></A>with his own voice.
<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "In letters I am perhaps equal to other men, but 
<A NAME="140"></A>the character of the superior man, carrying out in his conduct what he 
<A NAME="141"></A>professes, is what I have not yet attained to."
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "The sage and the man of perfect virtue;-how dare 
<A NAME="143"></A>I rank myself with them? It may simply be said of me, that I strive to 
<A NAME="144"></A>become such without satiety, and teach others without weariness." Kung-hsi 
<A NAME="145"></A>Hwa said, "This is just what we, the disciples, cannot imitate you 
<A NAME="146"></A>in."
<A NAME="147"></A><BR><BR>The Master being very sick, Tsze-lu asked leave to pray for him. 
<A NAME="148"></A>He said, "May such a thing be done?" Tsze-lu replied, "It may. In the Eulogies 
<A NAME="149"></A>it is said, 'Prayer has been made for thee to the spirits of the upper 
<A NAME="150"></A>and lower worlds.'" The Master said, "My praying has been for a long 
<A NAME="151"></A>time."
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Extravagance leads to insubordination, and parsimony 
<A NAME="153"></A>to meanness. It is better to be mean than to be insubordinate."
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "The superior man is satisfied and composed; the 
<A NAME="155"></A>mean man is always full of distress."
<A NAME="156"></A><BR><BR>The Master was mild, and yet dignified; majestic, and yet not fierce; 
<A NAME="157"></A>respectful, and yet easy.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="158"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="159"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "T'ai-po may be said to have reached the highest 
<A NAME="160"></A>point of virtuous action. Thrice he declined the kingdom, and the people 
<A NAME="161"></A>in ignorance of his motives could not express their approbation of his 
<A NAME="162"></A>conduct."
<A NAME="163"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Respectfulness, without the rules of propriety, 
<A NAME="164"></A>becomes laborious bustle; carefulness, without the rules of propriety, 
<A NAME="165"></A>becomes timidity; boldness, without the rules of propriety, becomes insubordination; 
<A NAME="166"></A>straightforwardness, without the rules of propriety, becomes 
<A NAME="167"></A>rudeness.
<A NAME="168"></A><BR><BR>"When those who are in high stations perform well all their duties 
<A NAME="169"></A>to their relations, the people are aroused to virtue. When old friends 
<A NAME="170"></A>are not neglected by them, the people are preserved from 
<A NAME="171"></A>meanness."
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR>The philosopher Tsang being ill, he cared to him the disciples 
<A NAME="173"></A>of his school, and said, "Uncover my feet, uncover my hands. It is said 
<A NAME="174"></A>in the Book of Poetry, 'We should be apprehensive and cautious, as if on 
<A NAME="175"></A>the brink of a deep gulf, as if treading on thin ice, I and so have I been. 
<A NAME="176"></A>Now and hereafter, I know my escape from all injury to my person. O ye, 
<A NAME="177"></A>my little children."
<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR>The philosopher Tsang being ill, Meng Chang went to ask how he 
<A NAME="179"></A>was.
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>Tsang said to him, "When a bird is about to die, its notes are mournful; 
<A NAME="181"></A>when a man is about to die, his words are good.
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>"There are three principles of conduct which the man of high rank 
<A NAME="183"></A>should consider specially important:-that in his deportment and manner 
<A NAME="184"></A>he keep from violence and heedlessness; that in regulating his countenance 
<A NAME="185"></A>he keep near to sincerity; and that in his words and tones he keep far 
<A NAME="186"></A>from lowness and impropriety. As to such matters as attending to the sacrificial 
<A NAME="187"></A>vessels, there are the proper officers for them."
<A NAME="188"></A><BR><BR>The philosopher Tsang said, "Gifted with ability, and yet putting 
<A NAME="189"></A>questions to those who were not so; possessed of much, and yet putting 
<A NAME="190"></A>questions to those possessed of little; having, as though he had not; full, 
<A NAME="191"></A>and yet counting himself as empty; offended against, and yet entering into 
<A NAME="192"></A>no altercation; formerly I had a friend who pursued this style of 
<A NAME="193"></A>conduct."
<A NAME="194"></A><BR><BR>The philosopher Tsang said, "Suppose that there is an individual 
<A NAME="195"></A>who can be entrusted with the charge of a young orphan prince, and can 
<A NAME="196"></A>be commissioned with authority over a state of a hundred li, and whom no 
<A NAME="197"></A>emergency however great can drive from his principles:-is such a man a 
<A NAME="198"></A>superior man? He is a superior man indeed."
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR>The philosopher Tsang said, "The officer may not be without breadth 
<A NAME="200"></A>of mind and vigorous endurance. His burden is heavy and his course is 
<A NAME="201"></A>long.
<A NAME="202"></A><BR><BR>"Perfect virtue is the burden which he considers it is his to sustain;-is 
<A NAME="203"></A>it not heavy? Only with death does his course stop;-is it not 
<A NAME="204"></A>long?
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "It is by the Odes that the mind is 
<A NAME="206"></A>aroused.
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>"It is by the Rules of Propriety that the character is 
<A NAME="208"></A>established.
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>"It is from Music that the finish is received."
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>The Master said, "The people may be made to follow a path of action, 
<A NAME="211"></A>but they may not be made to understand it."
<A NAME="212"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "The man who is fond of daring and is dissatisfied 
<A NAME="213"></A>with poverty, will proceed to insubordination. So will the man who is not 
<A NAME="214"></A>virtuous, when you carry your dislike of him to an extreme."
<A NAME="215"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Though a man have abilities as admirable as those 
<A NAME="216"></A>of the Duke of Chau, yet if he be proud and niggardly, those other things 
<A NAME="217"></A>are really not worth being looked at."
<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "It is not easy to find a man who has learned 
<A NAME="219"></A>for three years without coming to be good."
<A NAME="220"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "With sincere faith he unites the love of learning; 
<A NAME="221"></A>holding firm to death, he is perfecting the excellence of his 
<A NAME="222"></A>course.
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR>"Such an one will not enter a tottering state, nor dwell in a disorganized 
<A NAME="224"></A>one. When right principles of government prevail in the kingdom, he will 
<A NAME="225"></A>show himself; when they are prostrated, he will keep 
<A NAME="226"></A>concealed.
<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR>"When a country is well governed, poverty and a mean condition 
<A NAME="228"></A>are things to be ashamed of. When a country is ill governed, riches and 
<A NAME="229"></A>honor are things to be ashamed of."
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "He who is not in any particular office has nothing 
<A NAME="231"></A>to do with plans for the administration of its duties."
<A NAME="232"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "When the music master Chih first entered on his 
<A NAME="233"></A>office, the finish of the Kwan Tsu was magnificent;-how it filled the 
<A NAME="234"></A>ears!"
<A NAME="235"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Ardent and yet not upright, stupid and yet not 
<A NAME="236"></A>attentive; simple and yet not sincere:-such persons I do not 
<A NAME="237"></A>understand."
<A NAME="238"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Learn as if you could not reach your object, 
<A NAME="239"></A>and were always fearing also lest you should lose it."
<A NAME="240"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "How majestic was the manner in which Shun and 
<A NAME="241"></A>Yu held possession of the empire, as if it were nothing to 
<A NAME="242"></A>them!
<A NAME="243"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Great indeed was Yao as a sovereign! How majestic 
<A NAME="244"></A>was he! It is only Heaven that is grand, and only Yao corresponded to it. 
<A NAME="245"></A>How vast was his virtue! The people could find no name for 
<A NAME="246"></A>it.
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR>"How majestic was he in the works which he accomplished! How glorious 
<A NAME="248"></A>in the elegant regulations which he instituted!"
<A NAME="249"></A><BR><BR>Shun had five ministers, and the empire was well 
<A NAME="250"></A>governed.
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>King Wu said, "I have ten able ministers."
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>Confucius said, "Is not the saying that talents are difficult to find, 
<A NAME="253"></A>true? Only when the dynasties of T'ang and Yu met, were they more abundant 
<A NAME="254"></A>than in this of Chau, yet there was a woman among them. The able ministers 
<A NAME="255"></A>were no more than nine men.
<A NAME="256"></A><BR><BR>"King Wan possessed two of the three parts of the empire, and with 
<A NAME="257"></A>those he served the dynasty of Yin. The virtue of the house of Chau may 
<A NAME="258"></A>be said to have reached the highest point indeed."
<A NAME="259"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "I can find no flaw in the character of Yu. He 
<A NAME="260"></A>used himself coarse food and drink, but displayed the utmost filial piety 
<A NAME="261"></A>towards the spirits. His ordinary garments were poor, but he displayed 
<A NAME="262"></A>the utmost elegance in his sacrificial cap and apron. He lived in a low, 
<A NAME="263"></A>mean house, but expended all his strength on the ditches and water channels. 
<A NAME="264"></A>I can find nothing like a flaw in Yu."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="265"></A><B>Part 9</B>

<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR>The subjects of which the Master seldom spoke were-profitableness, 
<A NAME="267"></A>and also the appointments of Heaven, and perfect virtue.
<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR>A man of the village of Ta-hsiang said, "Great indeed is the philosopher 
<A NAME="269"></A>K'ung! His learning is extensive, and yet he does not render his name famous 
<A NAME="270"></A>by any particular thing."
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>The Master heard the observation, and said to his disciples, "What 
<A NAME="272"></A>shall I practice? Shall I practice charioteering, or shall I practice archery? 
<A NAME="273"></A>I will practice charioteering."
<A NAME="274"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "The linen cap is that prescribed by the rules 
<A NAME="275"></A>of ceremony, but now a silk one is worn. It is economical, and I follow 
<A NAME="276"></A>the common practice.
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR>"The rules of ceremony prescribe the bowing below the hall, but 
<A NAME="278"></A>now the practice is to bow only after ascending it. That is arrogant. I 
<A NAME="279"></A>continue to bow below the hall, though I oppose the common 
<A NAME="280"></A>practice."
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR>There were four things from which the Master was entirely free. 
<A NAME="282"></A>He had no foregone conclusions, no arbitrary predeterminations, no obstinacy, 
<A NAME="283"></A>and no egoism.
<A NAME="284"></A><BR><BR>The Master was put in fear in K'wang.
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>He said, "After the death of King Wan, was not the cause of truth lodged 
<A NAME="286"></A>here in me?
<A NAME="287"></A><BR><BR>"If Heaven had wished to let this cause of truth perish, then I, 
<A NAME="288"></A>a future mortal! should not have got such a relation to that cause. While 
<A NAME="289"></A>Heaven does not let the cause of truth perish, what can the people of K'wang 
<A NAME="290"></A>do to me?"
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR>A high officer asked Tsze-kung, saying, "May we not say that your 
<A NAME="292"></A>Master is a sage? How various is his ability!"
<A NAME="293"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-kung said, "Certainly Heaven has endowed him unlimitedly. 
<A NAME="294"></A>He is about a sage. And, moreover, his ability is various."
<A NAME="295"></A><BR><BR>The Master heard of the conversation and said, "Does the high officer 
<A NAME="296"></A>know me? When I was young, my condition was low, and I acquired my ability 
<A NAME="297"></A>in many things, but they were mean matters. Must the superior man have 
<A NAME="298"></A>such variety of ability? He does not need variety of ability. Lao said, 
<A NAME="299"></A>"The Master said, 'Having no official employment, I acquired many 
<A NAME="300"></A>arts.'"
<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Am I indeed possessed of knowledge? I am not 
<A NAME="302"></A>knowing. But if a mean person, who appears quite empty-like, ask anything 
<A NAME="303"></A>of me, I set it forth from one end to the other, and exhaust 
<A NAME="304"></A>it."
<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "The Fang bird does not come; the river sends 
<A NAME="306"></A>forth no map:-it is all over with me!"
<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR>When the Master saw a person in a mourning dress, or any one with 
<A NAME="308"></A>the cap and upper and lower garments of full dress, or a blind person, 
<A NAME="309"></A>on observing them approaching, though they were younger than himself, he 
<A NAME="310"></A>would rise up, and if he had to pass by them, he would do so 
<A NAME="311"></A>hastily.
<A NAME="312"></A><BR><BR>Yen Yuan, in admiration of the Master's doctrines, sighed and said, 
<A NAME="313"></A>"I looked up to them, and they seemed to become more high; I tried to penetrate 
<A NAME="314"></A>them, and they seemed to become more firm; I looked at them before me, 
<A NAME="315"></A>and suddenly they seemed to be behind.
<A NAME="316"></A><BR><BR>"The Master, by orderly method, skillfully leads men on. He enlarged 
<A NAME="317"></A>my mind with learning, and taught me the restraints of 
<A NAME="318"></A>propriety.
<A NAME="319"></A><BR><BR>"When I wish to give over the study of his doctrines, I cannot 
<A NAME="320"></A>do so, and having exerted all my ability, there seems something to stand 
<A NAME="321"></A>right up before me; but though I wish to follow and lay hold of it, I really 
<A NAME="322"></A>find no way to do so."
<A NAME="323"></A><BR><BR>The Master being very ill, Tsze-lu wished the disciples to act 
<A NAME="324"></A>as ministers to him.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR>During a remission of his illness, he said, "Long has the conduct 
<A NAME="326"></A>of Yu been deceitful! By pretending to have ministers when I have them 
<A NAME="327"></A>not, whom should I impose upon? Should I impose upon 
<A NAME="328"></A>Heaven?
<A NAME="329"></A><BR><BR>"Moreover, than that I should die in the hands of ministers, is 
<A NAME="330"></A>it not better that I should die in the hands of you, my disciples? And 
<A NAME="331"></A>though I may not get a great burial, shall I die upon the 
<A NAME="332"></A>road?"
<A NAME="333"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-kung said, "There is a beautiful gem here. Should I lay it 
<A NAME="334"></A>up in a case and keep it? or should I seek for a good price and sell it?" 
<A NAME="335"></A>The Master said, "Sell it! Sell it! But I would wait for one to offer the 
<A NAME="336"></A>price."
<A NAME="337"></A><BR><BR>The Master was wishing to go and live among the nine wild tribes 
<A NAME="338"></A>of the east.
<A NAME="339"></A><BR><BR>Some one said, "They are rude. How can you do such a thing?" The 
<A NAME="340"></A>Master said, "If a superior man dwelt among them, what rudeness would there 
<A NAME="341"></A>be?"
<A NAME="342"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "I returned from Wei to Lu, and then the music 
<A NAME="343"></A>was reformed, and the pieces in the Royal songs and Praise songs all found 
<A NAME="344"></A>their proper places."
<A NAME="345"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Abroad, to serve the high ministers and nobles; 
<A NAME="346"></A>at home, to serve one's father and elder brothers; in all duties to the 
<A NAME="347"></A>dead, not to dare not to exert one's self; and not to be overcome of wine:-which 
<A NAME="348"></A>one of these things do I attain to?"
<A NAME="349"></A><BR><BR>The Master standing by a stream, said, "It passes on just like 
<A NAME="350"></A>this, not ceasing day or night!"
<A NAME="351"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "I have not seen one who loves virtue as he loves 
<A NAME="352"></A>beauty."
<A NAME="353"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "The prosecution of learning may be compared to 
<A NAME="354"></A>what may happen in raising a mound. If there want but one basket of earth 
<A NAME="355"></A>to complete the work, and I stop, the stopping is my own work. It may be 
<A NAME="356"></A>compared to throwing down the earth on the level ground. Though but one 
<A NAME="357"></A>basketful is thrown at a time, the advancing with it my own going 
<A NAME="358"></A>forward."
<A NAME="359"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Never flagging when I set forth anything to him;-ah! 
<A NAME="360"></A>that is Hui." The Master said of Yen Yuan, "Alas! I saw his constant advance. 
<A NAME="361"></A>I never saw him stop in his progress."
<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "There are cases in which the blade springs, but 
<A NAME="363"></A>the plant does not go on to flower! There are cases where it flowers but 
<A NAME="364"></A>fruit is not subsequently produced!"
<A NAME="365"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "A youth is to be regarded with respect. How do 
<A NAME="366"></A>we know that his future will not be equal to our present? If he reach the 
<A NAME="367"></A>age of forty or fifty, and has not made himself heard of, then indeed he 
<A NAME="368"></A>will not be worth being regarded with respect."
<A NAME="369"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Can men refuse to assent to the words of strict 
<A NAME="370"></A>admonition? But it is reforming the conduct because of them which is valuable. 
<A NAME="371"></A>Can men refuse to be pleased with words of gentle advice? But it is unfolding 
<A NAME="372"></A>their aim which is valuable. If a man be pleased with these words, but 
<A NAME="373"></A>does not unfold their aim, and assents to those, but does not reform his 
<A NAME="374"></A>conduct, I can really do nothing with him."
<A NAME="375"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles. 
<A NAME="376"></A>Have no friends not equal to yourself. When you have faults, do not fear 
<A NAME="377"></A>to abandon them."
<A NAME="378"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "The commander of the forces of a large state 
<A NAME="379"></A>may be carried off, but the will of even a common man cannot be taken from 
<A NAME="380"></A>him."
<A NAME="381"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Dressed himself in a tattered robe quilted with 
<A NAME="382"></A>hemp, yet standing by the side of men dressed in furs, and not ashamed;-ah! 
<A NAME="383"></A>it is Yu who is equal to this!
<A NAME="384"></A><BR><BR>"He dislikes none, he covets nothing;-what can he do but what is 
<A NAME="385"></A>good!"
<A NAME="386"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-lu kept continually repeating these words of the ode, when 
<A NAME="387"></A>the Master said, "Those things are by no means sufficient to constitute 
<A NAME="388"></A>perfect excellence."
<A NAME="389"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "When the year becomes cold, then we know how 
<A NAME="390"></A>the pine and the cypress are the last to lose their 
<A NAME="391"></A>leaves."
<A NAME="392"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "The wise are free from perplexities; the virtuous 
<A NAME="393"></A>from anxiety; and the bold from fear."
<A NAME="394"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "There are some with whom we may study in common, 
<A NAME="395"></A>but we shall find them unable to go along with us to principles. Perhaps 
<A NAME="396"></A>we may go on with them to principles, but we shall find them unable to 
<A NAME="397"></A>get established in those along with us. Or if we may get so established 
<A NAME="398"></A>along with them, we shall find them unable to weigh occurring events along 
<A NAME="399"></A>with us."
<A NAME="400"></A><BR><BR>"How the flowers of the aspen-plum flutter and turn! Do I not think 
<A NAME="401"></A>of you? But your house is distant."
<A NAME="402"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "It is the want of thought about it. How is it 
<A NAME="403"></A>distant?"
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="404"></A><B>Part 10</B>

<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR>Confucius, in his village, looked simple and sincere, and as if 
<A NAME="406"></A>he were not able to speak.
<A NAME="407"></A><BR><BR>When he was in the prince's ancestral temple, or in the court, 
<A NAME="408"></A>he spoke minutely on every point, but cautiously.
<A NAME="409"></A><BR><BR>When he was waiting at court, in speaking with the great officers 
<A NAME="410"></A>of the lower grade, he spoke freely, but in a straightforward manner; in 
<A NAME="411"></A>speaking with those of the higher grade, he did so blandly, but 
<A NAME="412"></A>precisely.
<A NAME="413"></A><BR><BR>When the ruler was present, his manner displayed respectful uneasiness; 
<A NAME="414"></A>it was grave, but self-possessed.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR><BR>When the prince called him to employ him in the reception of a 
<A NAME="416"></A>visitor, his countenance appeared to change, and his legs to move forward 
<A NAME="417"></A>with difficulty.
<A NAME="418"></A><BR><BR>He inclined himself to the other officers among whom he stood, 
<A NAME="419"></A>moving his left or right arm, as their position required, but keeping the 
<A NAME="420"></A>skirts of his robe before and behind evenly adjusted.
<A NAME="421"></A><BR><BR>He hastened forward, with his arms like the wings of a 
<A NAME="422"></A>bird.
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>When the guest had retired, he would report to the prince, "The visitor 
<A NAME="424"></A>is not turning round any more."
<A NAME="425"></A><BR><BR>When he entered the palace gate, he seemed to bend his body, as 
<A NAME="426"></A>if it were not sufficient to admit him.
<A NAME="427"></A><BR><BR>When he was standing, he did not occupy the middle of the gateway; 
<A NAME="428"></A>when he passed in or out, he did not tread upon the 
<A NAME="429"></A>threshold.
<A NAME="430"></A><BR><BR>When he was passing the vacant place of the prince, his countenance 
<A NAME="431"></A>appeared to change, and his legs to bend under him, and his words came 
<A NAME="432"></A>as if he hardly had breath to utter them.
<A NAME="433"></A><BR><BR>He ascended the reception hall, holding up his robe with both his 
<A NAME="434"></A>hands, and his body bent; holding in his breath also, as if he dared not 
<A NAME="435"></A>breathe.
<A NAME="436"></A><BR><BR>When he came out from the audience, as soon as he had descended 
<A NAME="437"></A>one step, he began to relax his countenance, and had a satisfied look. 
<A NAME="438"></A>When he had got the bottom of the steps, he advanced rapidly to his place, 
<A NAME="439"></A>with his arms like wings, and on occupying it, his manner still showed 
<A NAME="440"></A>respectful uneasiness.
<A NAME="441"></A><BR><BR>When he was carrying the scepter of his ruler, he seemed to bend 
<A NAME="442"></A>his body, as if he were not able to bear its weight. He did not hold it 
<A NAME="443"></A>higher than the position of the hands in making a bow, nor lower than their 
<A NAME="444"></A>position in giving anything to another. His countenance seemed to change, 
<A NAME="445"></A>and look apprehensive, and he dragged his feet along as if they were held 
<A NAME="446"></A>by something to the ground.
<A NAME="447"></A><BR><BR>In presenting the presents with which he was charged, he wore a 
<A NAME="448"></A>placid appearance.
<A NAME="449"></A><BR><BR>At his private audience, he looked highly pleased.
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>The superior man did not use a deep purple, or a puce color, in the 
<A NAME="451"></A>ornaments of his dress.
<A NAME="452"></A><BR><BR>Even in his undress, he did not wear anything of a red or reddish 
<A NAME="453"></A>color.
<A NAME="454"></A><BR><BR>In warm weather, he had a single garment either of coarse or fine 
<A NAME="455"></A>texture, but he wore it displayed over an inner garment.
<A NAME="456"></A><BR><BR>Over lamb's fur he wore a garment of black; over fawn's fur one 
<A NAME="457"></A>of white; and over fox's fur one of yellow.
<A NAME="458"></A><BR><BR>The fur robe of his undress was long, with the right sleeve 
<A NAME="459"></A>short.
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>He required his sleeping dress to be half as long again as his 
<A NAME="461"></A>body.
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>When staying at home, he used thick furs of the fox or the 
<A NAME="463"></A>badger.
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>When he put off mourning, he wore all the appendages of the 
<A NAME="465"></A>girdle.
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>His undergarment, except when it was required to be of the curtain 
<A NAME="467"></A>shape, was made of silk cut narrow above and wide below.
<A NAME="468"></A><BR><BR>He did not wear lamb's fur or a black cap on a visit of 
<A NAME="469"></A>condolence.
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>On the first day of the month he put on his court robes, and presented 
<A NAME="471"></A>himself at court.
<A NAME="472"></A><BR><BR>When fasting, he thought it necessary to have his clothes brightly 
<A NAME="473"></A>clean and made of linen cloth.
<A NAME="474"></A><BR><BR>When fasting, he thought it necessary to change his food, and also 
<A NAME="475"></A>to change the place where he commonly sat in the apartment.
<A NAME="476"></A><BR><BR>He did not dislike to have his rice finely cleaned, nor to have 
<A NAME="477"></A>his mince meat cut quite small.
<A NAME="478"></A><BR><BR>He did not eat rice which had been injured by heat or damp and 
<A NAME="479"></A>turned sour, nor fish or flesh which was gone. He did not eat what was 
<A NAME="480"></A>discolored, or what was of a bad flavor, nor anything which was ill-cooked, 
<A NAME="481"></A>or was not in season.
<A NAME="482"></A><BR><BR>He did not eat meat which was not cut properly, nor what was served 
<A NAME="483"></A>without its proper sauce.
<A NAME="484"></A><BR><BR>Though there might be a large quantity of meat, he would not allow 
<A NAME="485"></A>what he took to exceed the due proportion for the rice. It was only in 
<A NAME="486"></A>wine that he laid down no limit for himself, but he did not allow himself 
<A NAME="487"></A>to be confused by it.
<A NAME="488"></A><BR><BR>He did not partake of wine and dried meat bought in the 
<A NAME="489"></A>market.
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>He was never without ginger when he ate. He did not eat 
<A NAME="491"></A>much.
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>When he had been assisting at the prince's sacrifice, he did not keep 
<A NAME="493"></A>the flesh which he received overnight. The flesh of his family sacrifice 
<A NAME="494"></A>he did not keep over three days. If kept over three days, people could 
<A NAME="495"></A>not eat it.
<A NAME="496"></A><BR><BR>When eating, he did not converse. When in bed, he did not 
<A NAME="497"></A>speak.
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>Although his food might be coarse rice and vegetable soup, he would 
<A NAME="499"></A>offer a little of it in sacrifice with a grave, respectful 
<A NAME="500"></A>air.
<A NAME="501"></A><BR><BR>If his mat was not straight, he did not sit on 
<A NAME="502"></A>it.
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>When the villagers were drinking together, upon those who carried staffs 
<A NAME="504"></A>going out, he also went out immediately after.
<A NAME="505"></A><BR><BR>When the villagers were going through their ceremonies to drive 
<A NAME="506"></A>away pestilential influences, he put on his court robes and stood on the 
<A NAME="507"></A>eastern steps.
<A NAME="508"></A><BR><BR>When he was sending complimentary inquiries to any one in another 
<A NAME="509"></A>state, he bowed twice as he escorted the messenger away.
<A NAME="510"></A><BR><BR>Chi K'ang having sent him a present of physic, he bowed and received 
<A NAME="511"></A>it, saying, "I do not know it. I dare not taste it."
<A NAME="512"></A><BR><BR>The stable being burned down, when he was at court, on his return 
<A NAME="513"></A>he said, "Has any man been hurt?" He did not ask about the 
<A NAME="514"></A>horses.
<A NAME="515"></A><BR><BR>When the he would adjust his mat, first taste it, and then give 
<A NAME="516"></A>it away to others. When the prince sent him a gift of undressed meat, he 
<A NAME="517"></A>would have it cooked, and offer it to the spirits of his ancestors. When 
<A NAME="518"></A>the prince sent him a gift of a living animal, he would keep it 
<A NAME="519"></A>alive.
<A NAME="520"></A><BR><BR>When he was in attendance on the prince and joining in the entertainment, 
<A NAME="521"></A>the prince only sacrificed. He first tasted everything.
<A NAME="522"></A><BR><BR>When he was ill and the prince came to visit him, he had his head 
<A NAME="523"></A>to the east, made his court robes be spread over him, and drew his girdle 
<A NAME="524"></A>across them.
<A NAME="525"></A><BR><BR>When the prince's order called him, without waiting for his carriage 
<A NAME="526"></A>to be yoked, he went at once.
<A NAME="527"></A><BR><BR>When he entered the ancestral temple of the state, he asked about 
<A NAME="528"></A>everything.
<A NAME="529"></A><BR><BR>When any of his friends died, if he had no relations offices, he 
<A NAME="530"></A>would say, "I will bury him."
<A NAME="531"></A><BR><BR>When a friend sent him a present, though it might be a carriage 
<A NAME="532"></A>and horses, he did not bow.
<A NAME="533"></A><BR><BR>The only present for which he bowed was that of the flesh of 
<A NAME="534"></A>sacrifice.
<A NAME="535"></A><BR><BR>In bed, he did not lie like a corpse. At home, he did not put on 
<A NAME="536"></A>any formal deportment.
<A NAME="537"></A><BR><BR>When he saw any one in a mourning dress, though it might be an 
<A NAME="538"></A>acquaintance, he would change countenance; when he saw any one wearing 
<A NAME="539"></A>the cap of full dress, or a blind person, though he might be in his undress, 
<A NAME="540"></A>he would salute him in a ceremonious manner.
<A NAME="541"></A><BR><BR>To any person in mourning he bowed forward to the crossbar of his 
<A NAME="542"></A>carriage; he bowed in the same way to any one bearing the tables of 
<A NAME="543"></A>population.
<A NAME="544"></A><BR><BR>When he was at an entertainment where there was an abundance of 
<A NAME="545"></A>provisions set before him, he would change countenance and rise 
<A NAME="546"></A>up.
<A NAME="547"></A><BR><BR>On a sudden clap of thunder, or a violent wind, he would change 
<A NAME="548"></A>countenance.
<A NAME="549"></A><BR><BR>When he was about to mount his carriage, he would stand straight, 
<A NAME="550"></A>holding the cord.
<A NAME="551"></A><BR><BR>When he was in the carriage, he did not turn his head quite round, 
<A NAME="552"></A>he did not talk hastily, he did not point with his hands.
<A NAME="553"></A><BR><BR>Seeing the countenance, it instantly rises. It flies round, and 
<A NAME="554"></A>by and by settles.
<A NAME="555"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "There is the hen-pheasant on the hill bridge. 
<A NAME="556"></A>At its season! At its season!" Tsze-lu made a motion to it. Thrice it smelt 
<A NAME="557"></A>him and then rose.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="558"></A><B>Part 11</B>

<A NAME="559"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "The men of former times in the matters of ceremonies 
<A NAME="560"></A>and music were rustics, it is said, while the men of these latter times, 
<A NAME="561"></A>in ceremonies and music, are accomplished gentlemen.
<A NAME="562"></A><BR><BR>"If I have occasion to use those things, I follow the men of former 
<A NAME="563"></A>times."
<A NAME="564"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Of those who were with me in Ch'an and Ts'ai, 
<A NAME="565"></A>there are none to be found to enter my door."
<A NAME="566"></A><BR><BR>Distinguished for their virtuous principles and practice, there 
<A NAME="567"></A>were Yen Yuan, Min Tsze-ch'ien, Zan Po-niu, and Chung-kung; for their ability 
<A NAME="568"></A>in speech, Tsai Wo and Tsze-kung; for their administrative talents, Zan 
<A NAME="569"></A>Yu and Chi Lu; for their literary acquirements, Tsze-yu and 
<A NAME="570"></A>Tsze-hsia.
<A NAME="571"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Hui gives me no assistance. There is nothing 
<A NAME="572"></A>that I say in which he does not delight."
<A NAME="573"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Filial indeed is Min Tsze-ch'ien! Other people 
<A NAME="574"></A>say nothing of him different from the report of his parents and 
<A NAME="575"></A>brothers."
<A NAME="576"></A><BR><BR>Nan Yung was frequently repeating the lines about a white scepter 
<A NAME="577"></A>stone. Confucius gave him the daughter of his elder brother to 
<A NAME="578"></A>wife.
<A NAME="579"></A><BR><BR>Chi K'ang asked which of the disciples loved to learn. Confucius 
<A NAME="580"></A>replied to him, "There was Yen Hui; he loved to learn. Unfortunately his 
<A NAME="581"></A>appointed time was short, and he died. Now there is no one who loves to 
<A NAME="582"></A>learn, as he did."
<A NAME="583"></A><BR><BR>When Yen Yuan died, Yen Lu begged the carriage of the Master to 
<A NAME="584"></A>sell and get an outer shell for his son's coffin.
<A NAME="585"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "Every one calls his son his son, whether he has 
<A NAME="586"></A>talents or has not talents. There was Li; when he died, he had a coffin 
<A NAME="587"></A>but no outer shell. I would not walk on foot to get a shell for him, because, 
<A NAME="588"></A>having followed in the rear of the great officers, it was not proper that 
<A NAME="589"></A>I should walk on foot."
<A NAME="590"></A><BR><BR>When Yen Yuan died, the Master said, "Alas! Heaven is destroying 
<A NAME="591"></A>me! Heaven is destroying me!"
<A NAME="592"></A><BR><BR>When Yen Yuan died, the Master bewailed him exceedingly, and the 
<A NAME="593"></A>disciples who were with him said, "Master, your grief is 
<A NAME="594"></A>excessive!"
<A NAME="595"></A><BR><BR>"Is it excessive?" said he. "If I am not to mourn bitterly for 
<A NAME="596"></A>this man, for whom should I mourn?"
<A NAME="597"></A><BR><BR>When Yen Yuan died, the disciples wished to give him a great funeral, 
<A NAME="598"></A>and the Master said, "You may not do so."
<A NAME="599"></A><BR><BR>The disciples did bury him in great style.
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>The Master said, "Hui behaved towards me as his father. I have not 
<A NAME="601"></A>been able to treat him as my son. The fault is not mine; it belongs to 
<A NAME="602"></A>you, O disciples."
<A NAME="603"></A><BR><BR>Chi Lu asked about serving the spirits of the dead. The Master 
<A NAME="604"></A>said, "While you are not able to serve men, how can you serve their spirits?" 
<A NAME="605"></A>Chi Lu added, "I venture to ask about death?" He was answered, "While you 
<A NAME="606"></A>do not know life, how can you know about death?"
<A NAME="607"></A><BR><BR>The disciple Min was standing by his side, looking bland and precise; 
<A NAME="608"></A>Tsze-lu, looking bold and soldierly; Zan Yu and Tsze-kung, with a free 
<A NAME="609"></A>and straightforward manner. The Master was pleased.
<A NAME="610"></A><BR><BR>He said, "Yu, there!-he will not die a natural 
<A NAME="611"></A>death."
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>Some parties in Lu were going to take down and rebuild the Long 
<A NAME="613"></A>Treasury.
<A NAME="614"></A><BR><BR>Min Tsze-ch'ien said, "Suppose it were to be repaired after its 
<A NAME="615"></A>old style;-why must it be altered and made anew?"
<A NAME="616"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "This man seldom speaks; when he does, he is sure 
<A NAME="617"></A>to hit the point."
<A NAME="618"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "What has the lute of Yu to do in my 
<A NAME="619"></A>door?"
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>The other disciples began not to respect Tszelu. The Master said, "Yu 
<A NAME="621"></A>has ascended to the hall, though he has not yet passed into the inner 
<A NAME="622"></A>apartments."
<A NAME="623"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-kung asked which of the two, Shih or Shang, was the superior. 
<A NAME="624"></A>The Master said, "Shih goes beyond the due mean, and Shang does not come 
<A NAME="625"></A>up to it."
<A NAME="626"></A><BR><BR>"Then," said Tsze-kung, "the superiority is with Shih, I 
<A NAME="627"></A>suppose."
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>The Master said, "To go beyond is as wrong as to fall 
<A NAME="629"></A>short."
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>The head of the Chi family was richer than the duke of Chau had been, 
<A NAME="631"></A>and yet Ch'iu collected his imposts for him, and increased his 
<A NAME="632"></A>wealth.
<A NAME="633"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "He is no disciple of mine. My little children, 
<A NAME="634"></A>beat the drum and assail him."
<A NAME="635"></A><BR><BR>Ch'ai is simple. Shan is dull. Shih is specious. Yu is 
<A NAME="636"></A>coarse.
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>The Master said, "There is Hui! He has nearly attained to perfect virtue. 
<A NAME="638"></A>He is often in want.
<A NAME="639"></A><BR><BR>"Ts'ze does not acquiesce in the appointments of Heaven, and his 
<A NAME="640"></A>goods are increased by him. Yet his judgments are often 
<A NAME="641"></A>correct."
<A NAME="642"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-chang asked what were the characteristics of the good man. 
<A NAME="643"></A>The Master said, "He does not tread in the footsteps of others, but moreover, 
<A NAME="644"></A>he does not enter the chamber of the sage."
<A NAME="645"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "If, because a man's discourse appears solid and 
<A NAME="646"></A>sincere, we allow him to be a good man, is he really a superior man? or 
<A NAME="647"></A>is his gravity only in appearance?"
<A NAME="648"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-lu asked whether he should immediately carry into practice 
<A NAME="649"></A>what he heard. The Master said, "There are your father and elder brothers 
<A NAME="650"></A>to be consulted;-why should you act on that principle of immediately carrying 
<A NAME="651"></A>into practice what you hear?" Zan Yu asked the same, whether he should 
<A NAME="652"></A>immediately carry into practice what he heard, and the Master answered, 
<A NAME="653"></A>"Immediately carry into practice what you hear." Kung-hsi Hwa said, "Yu 
<A NAME="654"></A>asked whether he should carry immediately into practice what he heard, 
<A NAME="655"></A>and you said, 'There are your father and elder brothers to be consulted.' 
<A NAME="656"></A>Ch'iu asked whether he should immediately carry into practice what he heard, 
<A NAME="657"></A>and you said, 'Carry it immediately into practice.' I, Ch'ih, am perplexed, 
<A NAME="658"></A>and venture to ask you for an explanation." The Master said, "Ch'iu is 
<A NAME="659"></A>retiring and slow; therefore I urged him forward. Yu has more than his 
<A NAME="660"></A>own share of energy; therefore I kept him back."
<A NAME="661"></A><BR><BR>The Master was put in fear in K'wang and Yen Yuan fell behind. 
<A NAME="662"></A>The Master, on his rejoining him, said, "I thought you had died." Hui replied, 
<A NAME="663"></A>"While you were alive, how should I presume to die?"
<A NAME="664"></A><BR><BR>Chi Tsze-zan asked whether Chung Yu and Zan Ch'iu could be called 
<A NAME="665"></A>great ministers.
<A NAME="666"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "I thought you would ask about some extraordinary 
<A NAME="667"></A>individuals, and you only ask about Yu and Ch'iu!
<A NAME="668"></A><BR><BR>"What is called a great minister, is one who serves his prince 
<A NAME="669"></A>according to what is right, and when he finds he cannot do so, 
<A NAME="670"></A>retires.
<A NAME="671"></A><BR><BR>"Now, as to Yu and Ch'iu, they may be called ordinary 
<A NAME="672"></A>ministers."
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>Tsze-zan said, "Then they will always follow their chief;-win 
<A NAME="674"></A>they?"
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>The Master said, "In an act of parricide or regicide, they would not 
<A NAME="676"></A>follow him."
<A NAME="677"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-lu got Tsze-kao appointed governor of Pi.
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>The Master said, "You are injuring a man's son."
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>Tsze-lu said, "There are, there, common people and officers; there 
<A NAME="680"></A>are the altars of the spirits of the land and grain. Why must one read 
<A NAME="681"></A>books before he can be considered to have learned?"
<A NAME="682"></A><BR><BR>The Master said, "It is on this account that I hate your glib-tongued 
<A NAME="683"></A>people."
<A NAME="684"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-lu, Tsang Hsi, Zan Yu, and Kunghsi Hwa were sitting by the 
<A NAME="685"></A>Master.
<A NAME="686"></A><BR><BR>He said to them, "Though I am a day or so older than you, do not 
<A NAME="687"></A>think of that.
<A NAME="688"></A><BR><BR>"From day to day you are saying, 'We are not known.' If some ruler 
<A NAME="689"></A>were to know you, what would you like to do?"
<A NAME="690"></A><BR><BR>Tsze-lu hastily and lightly replied, "Suppose the case of a state 
<A NAME="691"></A>of ten thousand chariots; let it be straitened between other large cities; 
<A NAME="692"></A>let it be suffering from invading armies; and to this let there be added 
<A NAME="693"></A>a famine in corn and in all vegetables:-if I were intrusted with the government 
<A NAME="694"></A>of it, in three years' time I could make the people to be bold, and to 
<A NAME="695"></A>recognize the rules of righteous conduct." The Master smiled at 
<A NAME="696"></A>him.
<A NAME="697"></A><BR><BR>Turning to Yen Yu, he said, "Ch'iu, what are your wishes?" Ch'iu 
<A NAME="698"></A>replied, "Suppose a state of sixty or seventy li square, or one of fifty 
<A NAME="699"></A>or sixty, and let me have the government of it;-in three years' time, I 
<A NAME="700"></A>could make plenty to abound among the people. As to teaching them the principles 
<A NAME="701"></A>of propriety, and music, I must wait for the rise of a superior man to 
<A NAME="702"></A>do that."
<A NAME="703"></A><BR><BR>"What are your wishes, Ch'ih," said the Master next to Kung-hsi 
<A NAME="704"></A>Hwa. Ch'ih replied, "I do not say that my ability extends to these things, 
<A NAME="705"></A>but I should wish to learn them. At the services of the ancestral temple, 
<A NAME="706"></A>and at the audiences of the princes with the sovereign, I should like, 
<A NAME="707"></A>dressed in the dark square-made robe and the black linen cap, to act as 
<A NAME="708"></A>a small assistant."
<A NAME="709"></A><BR><BR>Last of all, the Master asked Tsang Hsi, "Tien, what are your wishes?" 
<A NAME="710"></A>Tien, pausing as he was playing on his lute, while it was yet twanging, 
<A NAME="711"></A>laid the instrument aside, and "My wishes," he said, "are different from 
<A NAME="712"></A>the cherished purposes of these three gentlemen." "What harm is there in 
<A NAME="713"></A>that?" said the Master; "do you also, as well as they, speak out your wishes." 
<A NAME="714"></A>Tien then said, "In this, the last month of spring, with the dress of the 
<A NAME="715"></A>season all complete, along with five or six young men who have assumed 
<A NAME="716"></A>the cap, and six or seven boys, I would wash in the I, enjoy the breeze 
<A NAME="717"></A>among the rain altars, and return home singing." The Master heaved a sigh 
<A NAME="718"></A>and said, "I give my approval to Tien."
<A NAME="719"></A><BR><BR>The three others having gone out, Tsang Hsi remained behind, and 
<A NAME="720"></A>said, "What do you think of the words of these three friends?" The Master 
<A NAME="721"></A>replied, "They simply told each one his wishes."
<A NAME="722"></A><BR><BR>Hsi pursued, "Master, why did you smile at Yu?"
<A NAME="723"></A><BR>He was answered, "The management of a state demands the rules of propriety. 
<A NAME="724"></A>His words were not humble; therefore I smiled at him."
<A NAME="725"></A><BR><BR>Hsi again said, "But was it not a state which Ch'iu proposed for 
<A NAME="726"></A>himself?" The reply was, "Yes; did you ever see a territory of sixty or 
<A NAME="727"></A>seventy li or one of fifty or sixty, which was not a 
<A NAME="728"></A>state?"
<A NAME="729"></A><BR><BR>Once more, Hsi inquired, "And was it not a state which Ch'ih proposed 
<A NAME="730"></A>for himself?" The Master again replied, "Yes; who but princes have to do 
<A NAME="731"></A>with ancestral temples, and with audiences but the sovereign? If Ch'ih 
<A NAME="732"></A>were to be a small assistant in these services, who could be a great 
<A NAME="733"></A>one?
