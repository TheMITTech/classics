<BR><BR>Translated by Robert Drew Hicks</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Greeting.
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>Let no one be slow to seek wisdom when he is young nor weary in 
<A NAME="12"></A>the search thereof when he is grown old. For no age is too early or too 
<A NAME="13"></A>late for the health of the soul. And to say that the season for studying 
<A NAME="14"></A>philosophy has not yet come, or that it is past and gone, is like saying 
<A NAME="15"></A>that the season for happiness is not yet or that it is now no more. Therefore, 
<A NAME="16"></A>both old and young ought to seek wisdom, the former in order that, as age 
<A NAME="17"></A>comes over him, he may be young in good things because of the grace of 
<A NAME="18"></A>what has been, and the latter in order that, while he is young, he may 
<A NAME="19"></A>at the same time be old, because he has no fear of the things which are 
<A NAME="20"></A>to come. So we must exercise ourselves in the things which bring happiness, 
<A NAME="21"></A>since, if that be present, we have everything, and, if that be absent, 
<A NAME="22"></A>all our actions are directed toward attaining it.
<A NAME="23"></A><BR><BR>Those things which without ceasing I have declared to you, those 
<A NAME="24"></A>do, and exercise yourself in those, holding them to be the elements of 
<A NAME="25"></A>right life. First believe that God is a living being immortal and happy, 
<A NAME="26"></A>according to the notion of a god indicated by the common sense of humankind; 
<A NAME="27"></A>and so of him anything that is at agrees not with about him whatever may 
<A NAME="28"></A>uphold both his happyness and his immortality. For truly there are gods, 
<A NAME="29"></A>and knowledge of them is evident; but they are not such as the multitude 
<A NAME="30"></A>believe, seeing that people do not steadfastly maintain the notions they 
<A NAME="31"></A>form respecting them. Not the person who denies the gods worshipped by 
<A NAME="32"></A>the multitude, but he who affirms of the gods what the multitude believes 
<A NAME="33"></A>about them is truly impious. For the utterances of the multitude about 
<A NAME="34"></A>the gods are not true preconceptions but false assumptions; hence it is 
<A NAME="35"></A>that the greatest evils happen to the wicked and the greatest blessings 
<A NAME="36"></A>happen to the good from the hand of the gods, seeing that they are always 
<A NAME="37"></A>favorable to their own good qualities and take pleasure in people like 
<A NAME="38"></A>to themselves, but reject as alien whatever is not of their 
<A NAME="39"></A>kind.
<A NAME="40"></A><BR><BR>Accustom yourself to believe that death is nothing to us, for good 
<A NAME="41"></A>and evil imply awareness, and death is the privation of all awareness; 
<A NAME="42"></A>therefore a right understanding that death is nothing to us makes the mortality 
<A NAME="43"></A>of life enjoyable, not by adding to life an unlimited time, but by taking 
<A NAME="44"></A>away the yearning after immortality. For life has no terror; for those 
<A NAME="45"></A>who thoroughly apprehend that there are no terrors for them in ceasing 
<A NAME="46"></A>to live. Foolish, therefore, is the person who says that he fears death, 
<A NAME="47"></A>not because it will pain when it comes, but because it pains in the prospect. 
<A NAME="48"></A>Whatever causes no annoyance when it is present, causes only a groundless 
<A NAME="49"></A>pain in the expectation. Death, therefore, the most awful of evils, is 
<A NAME="50"></A>nothing to us, seeing that, when we are, death is not come, and, when death 
<A NAME="51"></A>is come, we are not. It is nothing, then, either to the living or to the 
<A NAME="52"></A>dead, for with the living it is not and the dead exist no longer. But in 
<A NAME="53"></A>the world, at one time people shun death as the greatest of all evils, 
<A NAME="54"></A>and at another time choose it as a respite from the evils in life. The 
<A NAME="55"></A>wise person does not deprecate life nor does he fear the cessation of life. 
<A NAME="56"></A>The thought of life is no offense to him, nor is the cessation of life 
<A NAME="57"></A>regarded as an evil. And even as people choose of food not merely and simply 
<A NAME="58"></A>the larger portion, but the more pleasant, so the wise seek to enjoy the 
<A NAME="59"></A>time which is most pleasant and not merely that which is longest. And he 
<A NAME="60"></A>who admonishes the young to live well and the old to make a good end speaks 
<A NAME="61"></A>foolishly, not merely because of the desirability of life, but because 
<A NAME="62"></A>the same exercise at once teaches to live well and to die well. Much worse 
<A NAME="63"></A>is he who says that it were good not to be born, but when once one is born 
<A NAME="64"></A>to pass with all speed through the gates of Hades. For if he truly believes 
<A NAME="65"></A>this, why does he not depart from life? It were easy for him to do so, 
<A NAME="66"></A>if once he were firmly convinced. If he speaks only in mockery, his words 
<A NAME="67"></A>are foolishness, for those who hear believe him not.
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR>We must remember that the future is neither wholly ours nor wholly 
<A NAME="69"></A>not ours, so that neither must we count upon it as quite certain to come 
<A NAME="70"></A>nor despair of it as quite certain not to come.
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>We must also reflect that of desires some are natural, others are 
<A NAME="72"></A>groundless; and that of the natural some are necessary as well as natural, 
<A NAME="73"></A>and some natural only. And of the necessary desires some are necessary 
<A NAME="74"></A>if we are to be happy, some if the body is to be rid of uneasiness, some 
<A NAME="75"></A>if we are even to live. He who has a clear and certain understanding of 
<A NAME="76"></A>these things will direct every preference and aversion toward securing 
<A NAME="77"></A>health of body and tranquillity of mind, seeing that this is the sum and 
<A NAME="78"></A>end of a happy life. For the end of all our actions is to be free from 
<A NAME="79"></A>pain and fear, and, when once we have attained all this, the tempest of 
<A NAME="80"></A>the soul is laid; seeing that the living creature has no need to go in 
<A NAME="81"></A>search of something that is lacking, nor to look anything else by which 
<A NAME="82"></A>the good of the soul and of the body will be fulfilled. When we are pained 
<A NAME="83"></A>pleasure, then, and then only, do we feel the need of pleasure. For this 
<A NAME="84"></A>reason we call pleasure the alpha and omega of a happy life. Pleasure is 
<A NAME="85"></A>our first and kindred good. It is the starting-point of every choice and 
<A NAME="86"></A>of every aversion, and to it we come back, inasmuch as we make feeling 
<A NAME="87"></A>the rule by which to judge of every good thing. And since pleasure is our 
<A NAME="88"></A>first and native good, for that reason we do not choose every pleasure 
<A NAME="89"></A>whatever, but often pass over many pleasures when a greater annoyance ensues 
<A NAME="90"></A>from them. And often we consider pains superior to pleasures when submission 
<A NAME="91"></A>to the pains for a long time brings us as a consequence a greater pleasure. 
<A NAME="92"></A>While therefore all pleasure because it is naturally akin to us is good, 
<A NAME="93"></A>not all pleasure is worthy of choice, just as all pain is an evil and yet 
<A NAME="94"></A>not all pain is to be shunned. It is, however, by measuring one against 
<A NAME="95"></A>another, and by looking at the conveniences and inconveniences, teat all 
<A NAME="96"></A>these matters must be judged. Sometimes we treat the good as an evil, and 
<A NAME="97"></A>the evil, on the contrary, as a good. Again, we regard. independence of 
<A NAME="98"></A>outward things as a great good, not so as in all cases to use little, but 
<A NAME="99"></A>so as to be contented with little if we have not much, being honestly persuaded 
<A NAME="100"></A>that they have the sweetest enjoyment of luxury who stand least in need 
<A NAME="101"></A>of it, and that whatever is natural is easily procured and only the vain 
<A NAME="102"></A>and worthless hard to win. Plain fare gives as much pleasure as a costly 
<A NAME="103"></A>diet, when one the pain of want has been removed, while bread an water 
<A NAME="104"></A>confer the highest possible pleasure when they are brought to hungry lips. 
<A NAME="105"></A>To habituate one's se therefore, to simple and inexpensive diet supplies 
<A NAME="106"></A>al that is needful for health, and enables a person to meet the necessary 
<A NAME="107"></A>requirements of life without shrinking and it places us in a better condition 
<A NAME="108"></A>when we approach at intervals a costly fare and renders us fearless of 
<A NAME="109"></A>fortune.
<A NAME="110"></A><BR><BR>When we say, then, that pleasure is the end and aim, we do not 
<A NAME="111"></A>mean the pleasures of the prodigal or the pleasures of sensuality, as we 
<A NAME="112"></A>are understood to do by some through ignorance, prejudice, or willful misrepresentation. 
<A NAME="113"></A>By pleasure we mean the absence of pain in the body and of trouble in the 
<A NAME="114"></A>soul. It is not an unbroken succession of drinking-bouts and of merrymaking, 
<A NAME="115"></A>not sexual love, not the enjoyment of the fish and other delicacies of 
<A NAME="116"></A>a luxurious table, which produce a pleasant life; it is sober reasoning, 
<A NAME="117"></A>searching out the grounds of every choice and avoidance, and banishing 
<A NAME="118"></A>those beliefs through which the greatest disturbances take possession of 
<A NAME="119"></A>the soul. Of all this the d is prudence. For this reason prudence is a 
<A NAME="120"></A>more precious thing even than the other virtues, for ad a life of pleasure 
<A NAME="121"></A>which is not also a life of prudence, honor, and justice; nor lead a life 
<A NAME="122"></A>of prudence, honor, and justice, which is not also a life of pleasure. 
<A NAME="123"></A>For the virtues have grown into one with a pleasant life, and a pleasant 
<A NAME="124"></A>life is inseparable from them.
<A NAME="125"></A><BR><BR>Who, then, is superior in your judgment to such a person? He holds 
<A NAME="126"></A>a holy belief concerning the gods, and is altogether free from the fear 
<A NAME="127"></A>of death. He has diligently considered the end fixed by nature, and understands 
<A NAME="128"></A>how easily the limit of good things can be reached and attained, and how 
<A NAME="129"></A>either the duration or the intensity of evils is but slight. Destiny which 
<A NAME="130"></A>some introduce as sovereign over all things, he laughs to scorn, affirming 
<A NAME="131"></A>rather that some things happen of necessity, others by chance, others through 
<A NAME="132"></A>our own agency. For he sees that necessity destroys responsibility and 
<A NAME="133"></A>that chance or fortune is inconstant; whereas our own actions are free, 
<A NAME="134"></A>and it is to them that praise and blame naturally attach. It were better, 
<A NAME="135"></A>indeed, to accept the legends of the gods than to bow beneath destiny which 
<A NAME="136"></A>the natural philosophers have imposed. The one holds out some faint hope 
<A NAME="137"></A>that we may escape if we honor the gods, while the necessity of the naturalists 
<A NAME="138"></A>is deaf to all entreaties. Nor does he hold chance to be a god, as the 
<A NAME="139"></A>world in general does, for in the acts of a god there is no disorder; nor 
<A NAME="140"></A>to be a cause, though an uncertain one, for he believes that no good or 
<A NAME="141"></A>evil is dispensed by chance to people so as to make life happy, though 
<A NAME="142"></A>it supplies the starting-point of great good and great evil. He believes 
<A NAME="143"></A>that the misfortune of the wise is better than the prosperity of the fool. 
<A NAME="144"></A>It is better, in short, that what is well judged in action should not owe 
<A NAME="145"></A>its successful issue to the aid of chance.
<A NAME="146"></A><BR><BR>Exercise yourself in these and kindred precepts day and night, 
<A NAME="147"></A>both by yourself and with him who is like to you; then never, either in 
<A NAME="148"></A>waking or in dream, will you be disturbed, but will live as a god among 
<A NAME="149"></A>people. For people lose all appearance of mortality by living in the midst 
<A NAME="150"></A>of immortal blessings.
