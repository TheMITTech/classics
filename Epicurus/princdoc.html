<A NAME="2"></A><BR><BR>By Epicurus
<A NAME="3"></A>
<BR><BR>Translated by Robert Drew Hicks</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A><B>1.</B> A happy and eternal being has no trouble himself and brings no 
<A NAME="11"></A>trouble upon any other being; hence he is exempt from movements of anger 
<A NAME="12"></A>and partiality, for every such movement implies weakness
<A NAME="13"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> Death is nothing to us; for the body, when it has been 
<A NAME="14"></A>resolved into its elements, has no feeling, and that which has no feeling 
<A NAME="15"></A>is nothing to us.
<A NAME="16"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> The magnitude of pleasure reaches its limit in the removal 
<A NAME="17"></A>of all pain. When pleasure is present, so long as it is uninterrupted, 
<A NAME="18"></A>there is no pain either of body or of mind or of both 
<A NAME="19"></A>together.
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> Continuous pain does not last long in the body; on the 
<A NAME="21"></A>contrary, pain, if extreme, is present a short time, and even that degree 
<A NAME="22"></A>of pain which barely outweighs pleasure in the body does not last for many 
<A NAME="23"></A>days together. Illnesses of long duration even permit of an excess of pleasure 
<A NAME="24"></A>over pain in the body.
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><BR><B>5.</B> It is impossible to live a pleasant life without living 
<A NAME="26"></A>wisely and well and justly, and it is impossible to live wisely and well 
<A NAME="27"></A>and justly without living pleasantly. Whenever any one of these is lacking, 
<A NAME="28"></A>when, for instance, the person is not able to live wisely, though he lives 
<A NAME="29"></A>well and justly, it is impossible for him to live a pleasant 
<A NAME="30"></A>life.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR><B>6.</B> In order to obtain security from other people any means 
<A NAME="32"></A>whatever of procuring this was a natural good.
<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR><B>7.</B> Some people have sought to become famous and renowned, 
<A NAME="34"></A>thinking that thus they would make themselves secure against their fellow-humans. 
<A NAME="35"></A>If, then, the life of such persons really was secure, they attained natural 
<A NAME="36"></A>good; if, however, it was insecure, they have not attained the end which 
<A NAME="37"></A>by nature's own prompting they originally sought.
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR><B>8.</B> No pleasure is in itself evil, but the things which produce 
<A NAME="39"></A>certain pleasures entail annoyances many times greater than the pleasures 
<A NAME="40"></A>themselves.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR><BR><B>9.</B> If all pleasure had been capable of accumulation, -- 
<A NAME="42"></A>if this had gone on not only be recurrences in time, but all over the frame 
<A NAME="43"></A>or, at any rate, over the principal parts of human nature, there would 
<A NAME="44"></A>never have been any difference between one pleasure and another, as in 
<A NAME="45"></A>fact there is.
<A NAME="46"></A><BR><BR><B>10.</B> If the objects which are productive of pleasures to 
<A NAME="47"></A>profligate persons really freed them from fears of the mind, -- the fears, 
<A NAME="48"></A>I mean, inspired by celestial and atmospheric phenomena, the fear of death, 
<A NAME="49"></A>the fear of pain; if, further, they taught them to limit their desires, 
<A NAME="50"></A>we should never have any fault to find with such persons, for they would 
<A NAME="51"></A>then be filled with pleasures to overflowing on all sides and would be 
<A NAME="52"></A>exempt from all pain, whether of body or mind, that is, from all 
<A NAME="53"></A>evil.
<A NAME="54"></A><BR><BR><B>11.</B> If we had never been molested by alarms at celestial 
<A NAME="55"></A>and atmospheric phenomena, nor by the misgiving that death somehow affects 
<A NAME="56"></A>us, nor by neglect of the proper limits of pains and desires, we should 
<A NAME="57"></A>have had no need to study natural science.
<A NAME="58"></A><BR><BR><B>12.</B> It would be impossible to banish fear on matters of 
<A NAME="59"></A>the highest importance, if a person did not know the nature of the whole 
<A NAME="60"></A>universe, but lived in dread of what the legends tell us. Hence without 
<A NAME="61"></A>the study of nature there was no enjoyment of unmixed 
<A NAME="62"></A>pleasures.
<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR><B>13.</B> There would be no advantage in providing security against 
<A NAME="64"></A>our fellow humans, so long as we were alarmed by occurrences over our heads 
<A NAME="65"></A>or beneath the earth or in general by whatever happens in the boundless 
<A NAME="66"></A>universe.
<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR><B>14.</B> When tolerable security against our fellow humans is 
<A NAME="68"></A>attained, then on a basis of power sufficient to afford supports and of 
<A NAME="69"></A>material prosperity arises in most genuine form the security of a quiet 
<A NAME="70"></A>private life withdrawn from the multitude.
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR><B>15.</B> Nature's wealth at once has its bounds and is easy to 
<A NAME="72"></A>procure; but the wealth of vain fancies recedes to an infinite 
<A NAME="73"></A>distance.
<A NAME="74"></A><BR><BR><B>16.</B> Fortune but seldom interferes with the wise person; 
<A NAME="75"></A>his greatest and highest interests have been, are, and will be, directed 
<A NAME="76"></A>by reason throughout the course of his life.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR><B>17.</B> The just person enjoys. the greatest peace of mind, 
<A NAME="78"></A>while the unjust is full of the utmost disquietude.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR><B>18.</B> Pleasure in the body admits no increase when once the 
<A NAME="80"></A>pain of want has been removed; after that it only admits of variation. 
<A NAME="81"></A>The limit of pleasure in the mind, however, is reached when we reflect 
<A NAME="82"></A>on the things themselves and their congeners which cause the mind the greatest 
<A NAME="83"></A>alarms.
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><BR><B>19.</B> Unlimited time and limited time afford an equal amount 
<A NAME="85"></A>of pleasure, if we measure the limits of that pleasure by 
<A NAME="86"></A>reason.
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR><B>20.</B> The body receives as unlimited the limits of pleasure; 
<A NAME="88"></A>and to provide it requires unlimited time. But the mind, grasping in thought 
<A NAME="89"></A>what the end and limit of the body is, and banishing the terrors of futurity, 
<A NAME="90"></A>procures a complete and perfect life, and has no longer any need of unlimited 
<A NAME="91"></A>time. Nevertheless it does not shun pleasure, and even in the hour of death, 
<A NAME="92"></A>when ushered out of existence by circumstances, the mind does not lack 
<A NAME="93"></A>enjoyment of the best life.
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR><B>21.</B> He who understands the limits of life knows how easy 
<A NAME="95"></A>it is to procure enough to remove the pain of want and make the whole of 
<A NAME="96"></A>life complete and perfect. Hence he has no longer any need of things which 
<A NAME="97"></A>are not to be won save by labor and conflict.
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR><B>22.</B> We must take into account as the end all that really 
<A NAME="99"></A>exists and all clear evidence of sense to which we refer our opinions; 
<A NAME="100"></A>for otherwise everything will be full of uncertainty and 
<A NAME="101"></A>confusion.
<A NAME="102"></A><BR><BR><B>23.</B> If you fight against all your sensations, you will have 
<A NAME="103"></A>no standard to which to refer, and thus no means of judging even those 
<A NAME="104"></A>judgments which you pronounce false.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR><B>24.</B> If you reject absolutely any single sensation without 
<A NAME="106"></A>stopping to discriminate with respect to that which awaits confirmation 
<A NAME="107"></A>between matter of opinion and that which is already present, whether in 
<A NAME="108"></A>sensation or in feelings or in any immediate perception of the mind, you 
<A NAME="109"></A>will throw into confusion even the rest of your sensations by your groundless 
<A NAME="110"></A>belief and so you will be rejecting the standard of truth altogether. If 
<A NAME="111"></A>in your ideas based upon opinion you hastily affirm as true all that awaits 
<A NAME="112"></A>confirmation as well as that which does not, you will not escape error, 
<A NAME="113"></A>as you will be maintaining complete ambiguity whenever it is a case of 
<A NAME="114"></A>judging between right and wrong opinion.
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR><B>25.</B> If you do not on every separate occasion refer each 
<A NAME="116"></A>of your actions to the end prescribed by nature, but instead of this in 
<A NAME="117"></A>the act of choice or avoidance swerve aside to some other end, your acts 
<A NAME="118"></A>will not be consistent with your theories.
<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR><B>26.</B> All such desires as lead to no pain when they remain 
<A NAME="120"></A>ungratified are unnecessary, and the longing is easily got rid of, when 
<A NAME="121"></A>the thing desired is difficult to procure or when the desires seem likely 
<A NAME="122"></A>to produce harm.
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR><B>27.</B> Of all the means which are procured by wisdom to ensure 
<A NAME="124"></A>happiness throughout the whole of life, by far the most important is the 
<A NAME="125"></A>acquisition of friends.
<A NAME="126"></A><BR><BR><B>28.</B> The same conviction which inspires confidence that nothing 
<A NAME="127"></A>we have to fear is eternal or even of long duration, also enables us to 
<A NAME="128"></A>see that even in our limited conditions of life nothing enhances our security 
<A NAME="129"></A>so much as friendship.
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR><B>29.</B> Of our desires some are natural and necessary others 
<A NAME="131"></A>are natural, but not necessary; others, again, are neither natural nor 
<A NAME="132"></A>necessary, but are due to illusory opinion.
<A NAME="133"></A><BR><BR><B>30.</B> Those natural desires which entail no pain when not 
<A NAME="134"></A>gratified, though their objects are vehemently pursued, are also due to 
<A NAME="135"></A>illusory opinion; and when they are not got rid of, it is not because of 
<A NAME="136"></A>their own nature, but because of the person's illusory 
<A NAME="137"></A>opinion.
<A NAME="138"></A><BR><BR><B>31.</B> Natural justice is a symbol or expression of usefullness, 
<A NAME="139"></A>to prevent one person from harming or being harmed by 
<A NAME="140"></A>another.
<A NAME="141"></A><BR><BR><B>32.</B> Those animals which are incapable of making covenants 
<A NAME="142"></A>with one another, to the end that they may neither inflict nor suffer harm, 
<A NAME="143"></A>are without either justice or injustice. And those tribes which either 
<A NAME="144"></A>could not or would not form mutual covenants to the same end are in like 
<A NAME="145"></A>case.
<A NAME="146"></A><BR><BR><B>33.</B> There never was an absolute justice, but only an agreement 
<A NAME="147"></A>made in reciprocal association in whatever localities now and again from 
<A NAME="148"></A>time to time, providing against the infliction or suffering of 
<A NAME="149"></A>harm.
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR><B>34.</B> Injustice is not in itself an evil, but only in its 
<A NAME="151"></A>consequence, viz. the terror which is excited by apprehension that those 
<A NAME="152"></A>appointed to punish such offenses will discover the 
<A NAME="153"></A>injustice.
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR><B>35.</B> It is impossible for the person who secretly violates 
<A NAME="155"></A>any article of the social compact to feel confident that he will remain 
<A NAME="156"></A>undiscovered, even if he has already escaped ten thousand times; for right 
<A NAME="157"></A>on to the end of his life he is never sure he will not be 
<A NAME="158"></A>detected.
<A NAME="159"></A><BR><BR><B>36.</B> Taken generally, justice is the same for all, to wit, 
<A NAME="160"></A>something found useful in mutual association; but in its application to 
<A NAME="161"></A>particular cases of locality or conditions of whatever kind, it varies 
<A NAME="162"></A>under different circumstances.
<A NAME="163"></A><BR><BR><B>37.</B> Among the things accounted just by conventional law, 
<A NAME="164"></A>whatever in the needs of mutual association is attested to be useful, is 
<A NAME="165"></A>thereby stamped as just, whether or not it be the same for all; and in 
<A NAME="166"></A>case any law is made and does not prove suitable to the usefulness of mutual 
<A NAME="167"></A>association, then this is no longer just. And should the usefulness which 
<A NAME="168"></A>is expressed by the law vary and only for a time correspond with the prior 
<A NAME="169"></A>conception, nevertheless for the time being it was just, so long as we 
<A NAME="170"></A>do not trouble ourselves about empty words, but look simply at the 
<A NAME="171"></A>facts.
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR><B>38.</B> Where without any change in circumstances the conventional 
<A NAME="173"></A>laws, when judged by their consequences, were seen not to correspond with 
<A NAME="174"></A>the notion of justice, such laws were not really just; but wherever the 
<A NAME="175"></A>laws have ceased to be useful in consequence of a change in circumstances, 
<A NAME="176"></A>in that case the laws were for the time being just when they were useful 
<A NAME="177"></A>for the mutual association of the citizens, and subsequently ceased to 
<A NAME="178"></A>be just when they ceased to be useful.
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR><B>39.</B> He who best knew how to meet fear of external foes made 
<A NAME="180"></A>into one family all the creatures he could; and those he could not, he 
<A NAME="181"></A>at any rate did not treat as aliens; and where he found even this impossible, 
<A NAME="182"></A>he avoided all association, and, so far as was useful, kept them at a 
<A NAME="183"></A>distance.
<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR><B>40.</B> Those who were best able to provide themselves with 
<A NAME="185"></A>the means of security against their neighbors, being thus in possession 
<A NAME="186"></A>of the surest guarantee, passed the most agreeable life in each other's 
<A NAME="187"></A>society; and their enjoyment of the fullest intimacy was such that, if 
<A NAME="188"></A>one of them died before his time, the survivors did not mourn his death 
<A NAME="189"></A>as if it called for sympathy.
