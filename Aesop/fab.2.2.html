<A NAME="10"></A><B>The Shepherd and the Wolf</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>A Shepherd once found the whelp of a Wolf and brought it up, and after 
<A NAME="12"></A>a while taught it to steal lambs from the neighboring flocks.  The Wolf, 
<A NAME="13"></A>having shown himself an apt pupil, said to the Shepherd, "Since you have 
<A NAME="14"></A>taught me to steal, you must keep a sharp lookout, or you will lose some 
<A NAME="15"></A>of your own flock."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="16"></A><B>The Father and His Two Daughters</B>

<A NAME="17"></A><BR><BR>A Man had two daughters, the one married to a gardener, and the 
<A NAME="18"></A>other to a tile-maker.  After a time he went to the daughter who had married 
<A NAME="19"></A>the gardener, and inquired how she was and how all things went with her. 
<A NAME="20"></A> She said, "All things are prospering with me, and I have only one wish, 
<A NAME="21"></A>that there may be a heavy fall of rain, in order that the plants may be 
<A NAME="22"></A>well watered."  Not long after, he went to the daughter who had married 
<A NAME="23"></A>the tilemaker, and likewise inquired of her how she fared; she replied, 
<A NAME="24"></A>"I want for nothing, and have only one wish, that the dry weather may continue, 
<A NAME="25"></A>and the sun shine hot and bright, so that the bricks might be dried." 
<A NAME="26"></A> He said to her, "If your sister wishes for rain, and you for dry weather, 
<A NAME="27"></A>with which of the two am I to join my wishes?'
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="28"></A><B>The Farmer and His Sons</B>

<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR>A father, being on the point of death, wished to be sure that his 
<A NAME="30"></A>sons would give the same attention to his farm as he himself had given 
<A NAME="31"></A>it.  He called them to his bedside and said, "My sons, there is a great 
<A NAME="32"></A>treasure hid in one of my vineyards."  The sons, after his death, took 
<A NAME="33"></A>their spades and mattocks and carefully dug over every portion of their 
<A NAME="34"></A>land.  They found no treasure, but the vines repaid their labor by an extraordinary 
<A NAME="35"></A>and superabundant crop.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="36"></A><B>The Crab and Its Mother</B>

<A NAME="37"></A><BR><BR>A Crab said to her son, "Why do you walk so one-sided, my child? 
<A NAME="38"></A>It is far more becoming to go straight forward."  The young Crab replied: 
<A NAME="39"></A> "Quite true, dear Mother; and if you will show me the straight way, I 
<A NAME="40"></A>will promise to walk in it."  The Mother tried in vain, and submitted without 
<A NAME="41"></A>remonstrance to the reproof of her child.
<A NAME="42"></A><BR><BR>Example is more powerful than precept.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="43"></A><B>The Heifer and the Ox</B>

<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR>A Heifer saw an Ox hard at work harnessed to a plow, and tormented 
<A NAME="45"></A>him with reflections on his unhappy fate in being compelled to labor. 
<A NAME="46"></A> Shortly afterwards, at the harvest festival, the owner released the Ox 
<A NAME="47"></A>from his yoke, but bound the Heifer with cords and led him away to the 
<A NAME="48"></A>altar to be slain in honor of the occasion.  The Ox saw what was being 
<A NAME="49"></A>done, and said with a smile to the Heifer:  "For this you were allowed 
<A NAME="50"></A>to live in idleness, because you were presently to be 
<A NAME="51"></A>sacrificed."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="52"></A><B>The Swallow, the Serpent, and the Court of Justice</B>

<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR>A Swallow, returning from abroad and especially fond of dwelling 
<A NAME="54"></A>with men, built herself a nest in the wall of a Court of Justice and there 
<A NAME="55"></A>hatched seven young birds.  A Serpent gliding past the nest from its hole 
<A NAME="56"></A>in the wall ate up the young unfledged nestlings.  The Swallow, finding 
<A NAME="57"></A>her nest empty, lamented greatly and exclaimed:  "Woe to me a stranger! 
<A NAME="58"></A>that in this place where all others' rights are protected, I alone should 
<A NAME="59"></A>suffer wrong."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="60"></A><B>The Thief and His Mother</B>

<A NAME="61"></A><BR><BR>A Boy stole a lesson-book from one of his schoolfellows and took 
<A NAME="62"></A>it home to his Mother.  She not only abstained from beating him, but encouraged 
<A NAME="63"></A>him.  He next time stole a cloak and brought it to her, and she again commended 
<A NAME="64"></A>him.  The Youth, advanced to adulthood, proceeded to steal things of still 
<A NAME="65"></A>greater value.  At last he was caught in the very act, and having his hands 
<A NAME="66"></A>bound behind him, was led away to the place of public execution.  His Mother 
<A NAME="67"></A>followed in the crowd and violently beat her breast in sorrow, whereupon 
<A NAME="68"></A>the young man said, "I wish to say something to my Mother in her ear." 
<A NAME="69"></A> She came close to him, and he quickly seized her ear with his teeth and 
<A NAME="70"></A>bit it off.  The Mother upbraided him as an unnatural child, whereon he 
<A NAME="71"></A>replied, "Ah! if you had beaten me when I first stole and brought to you 
<A NAME="72"></A>that lesson-book, I should not have come to this, nor have been thus led 
<A NAME="73"></A>to a disgraceful death."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="74"></A><B>The Old Man and Death</B>

<A NAME="75"></A><BR><BR>An Old Man was employed in cutting wood in the forest, and, in 
<A NAME="76"></A>carrying the faggots to the city for sale one day, became very wearied 
<A NAME="77"></A>with his long journey.  He sat down by the wayside, and throwing down his 
<A NAME="78"></A>load, besought "Death" to come.  "Death" immediately appeared in answer 
<A NAME="79"></A>to his summons and asked for what reason he had called him.  The Old Man 
<A NAME="80"></A>hurriedly replied, "That, lifting up the load, you may place it again upon 
<A NAME="81"></A>my shoulders."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="82"></A><B>The Fir-Tree and the Bramble</B>

<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR>A Fir-Tree said boastingly to the Bramble, "You are useful for 
<A NAME="84"></A>nothing at all; while I am everywhere used for roofs and houses." The Bramble 
<A NAME="85"></A>answered:  'You poor creature, if you would only call to mind the axes 
<A NAME="86"></A>and saws which are about to hew you down, you would have reason to wish 
<A NAME="87"></A>that you had grown up a Bramble, not a Fir-Tree."
<A NAME="88"></A><BR><BR>Better poverty without care, than riches with.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="89"></A><B>The Mouse, the Frog, and the Hawk</B>

<A NAME="90"></A><BR><BR>A Mouse who always lived on the land, by an unlucky chance formed 
<A NAME="91"></A>an intimate acquaintance with a Frog, who lived for the most part in the 
<A NAME="92"></A>water.  The Frog, one day intent on mischief, bound the foot of the Mouse 
<A NAME="93"></A>tightly to his own.  Thus joined together, the Frog first of all led his 
<A NAME="94"></A>friend the Mouse to the meadow where they were accustomed to find their 
<A NAME="95"></A>food.  After this, he gradually led him towards the pool in which he lived, 
<A NAME="96"></A>until reaching the very brink, he suddenly jumped in, dragging the Mouse 
<A NAME="97"></A>with him.  The Frog enjoyed the water amazingly, and swam croaking about, 
<A NAME="98"></A>as if he had done a good deed.  The unhappy Mouse was soon suffocated by 
<A NAME="99"></A>the water, and his dead body floated about on the surface, tied to the 
<A NAME="100"></A>foot of the Frog.  A Hawk observed it, and, pouncing upon it with his talons, 
<A NAME="101"></A>carried it aloft.  The Frog, being still fastened to the leg of the Mouse, 
<A NAME="102"></A>was also carried off a prisoner, and was eaten by the 
<A NAME="103"></A>Hawk.
<A NAME="104"></A><BR><BR>Harm hatch, harm catch.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="105"></A><B>The Man Bitten By a Dog</B>

<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR>A Man who had been bitten by a Dog went about in quest of someone 
<A NAME="107"></A>who might heal him.  A friend, meeting him and learning what he wanted, 
<A NAME="108"></A>said, "If you would be cured, take a piece of bread, and dip it in the 
<A NAME="109"></A>blood from your wound, and go and give it to the Dog that bit you."  The 
<A NAME="110"></A>Man who had been bitten laughed at this advice and said, "Why? If I should 
<A NAME="111"></A>do so, it would be as if I should beg every Dog in the town to bite 
<A NAME="112"></A>me."
<A NAME="113"></A><BR><BR>Benefits bestowed upon the evil-disposed increase their means of 
<A NAME="114"></A>injuring you.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="115"></A><B>The Two Pots</B>

<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR>A river carried down in its stream two Pots, one made of earthenware 
<A NAME="117"></A>and the other of brass.  The Earthen Pot said to the Brass Pot, "Pray keep 
<A NAME="118"></A>at a distance and do not come near me, for if you touch me ever so slightly, 
<A NAME="119"></A>I shall be broken in pieces, and besides, I by no means wish to come near 
<A NAME="120"></A>you."
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR>Equals make the best friends.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="122"></A><B>The Wolf and the Sheep</B>

<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>A Wolf, sorely wounded and bitten by dogs, lay sick and maimed 
<A NAME="124"></A>in his lair.  Being in want of food, he called to a Sheep who was passing, 
<A NAME="125"></A>and asked him to fetch some water from a stream flowing close beside him. 
<A NAME="126"></A> "For," he said, "if you will bring me drink, I will find means to provide 
<A NAME="127"></A>myself with meat."  "Yes," said the Sheep, "if I should bring you the draught, 
<A NAME="128"></A>you would doubtless make me provide the meat also."
<A NAME="129"></A><BR><BR>Hypocritical speeches are easily seen through.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="130"></A><B>The Aethiop</B>

<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR>The purchaser of a black servant was persuaded that the color of 
<A NAME="132"></A>his skin arose from dirt contracted through the neglect of his former masters. 
<A NAME="133"></A> On bringing him home he resorted to every means of cleaning, and subjected 
<A NAME="134"></A>the man to incessant scrubbings.  The servant caught a severe cold, but 
<A NAME="135"></A>he never changed his color or complexion.
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>What's bred in the bone will stick to the flesh.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="137"></A><B>The Fisherman and His Nets</B>

<A NAME="138"></A><BR><BR>A Fisherman, engaged in his calling, made a very successful cast 
<A NAME="139"></A>and captured a great haul of fish.  He managed by a skillful handling of 
<A NAME="140"></A>his net to retain all the large fish and to draw them to the shore; but 
<A NAME="141"></A>he could not prevent the smaller fish from falling back through the meshes 
<A NAME="142"></A>of the net into the sea.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="143"></A><B>The Huntsman and the Fisherman</B>

<A NAME="144"></A><BR><BR>A Huntsman, returning with his dogs from the field, fell in by 
<A NAME="145"></A>chance with a Fisherman who was bringing home a basket well laden with 
<A NAME="146"></A>fish.  The Huntsman wished to have the fish, and their owner experienced 
<A NAME="147"></A>an equal longing for the contents of the game-bag. They quickly agreed 
<A NAME="148"></A>to exchange the produce of their day's sport. Each was so well pleased 
<A NAME="149"></A>with his bargain that they made for some time the same exchange day after 
<A NAME="150"></A>day.  Finally a neighbor said to them, "If you go on in this way, you will 
<A NAME="151"></A>soon destroy by frequent use the pleasure of your exchange, and each will 
<A NAME="152"></A>again wish to retain the fruits of his own sport."
<A NAME="153"></A><BR><BR>Abstain and enjoy.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="154"></A><B>The Old Woman and the Wine-Jar</B>

<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR>An Old Woman found an empty jar which had lately been full of prime 
<A NAME="156"></A>old wine and which still retained the fragrant smell of its former contents. 
<A NAME="157"></A> She greedily placed it several times to her nose, and drawing it backwards 
<A NAME="158"></A>and forwards said, "O most delicious! How nice must the Wine itself have 
<A NAME="159"></A>been, when it leaves behind in the very vessel which contained it so sweet 
<A NAME="160"></A>a perfume!"
<A NAME="161"></A><BR><BR>The memory of a good deed lives.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="162"></A><B>The Fox and the Crow</B>

<A NAME="163"></A><BR><BR>A Crow having stolen a bit of meat, perched in a tree and held 
<A NAME="164"></A>it in her beak.  A Fox, seeing this, longed to possess the meat himself, 
<A NAME="165"></A>and by a wily stratagem succeeded.  "How handsome is the Crow," he exclaimed, 
<A NAME="166"></A>in the beauty of her shape and in the fairness of her complexion! Oh, if 
<A NAME="167"></A>her voice were only equal to her beauty, she would deservedly be considered 
<A NAME="168"></A>the Queen of Birds!"  This he said deceitfully; but the Crow, anxious to 
<A NAME="169"></A>refute the reflection cast upon her voice, set up a loud caw and dropped 
<A NAME="170"></A>the flesh.  The Fox quickly picked it up, and thus addressed the Crow: 
<A NAME="171"></A> "My good Crow, your voice is right enough, but your wit is 
<A NAME="172"></A>wanting."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="173"></A><B>The Two Dogs</B>

<A NAME="174"></A><BR><BR>A Man had two dogs:  a Hound, trained to assist him in his sports, 
<A NAME="175"></A>and a Housedog, taught to watch the house.  When he returned home after 
<A NAME="176"></A>a good day's sport, he always gave the Housedog a large share of his spoil. 
<A NAME="177"></A> The Hound, feeling much aggrieved at this, reproached his companion, saying, 
<A NAME="178"></A>"It is very hard to have all this labor, while you, who do not assist in 
<A NAME="179"></A>the chase, luxuriate on the fruits of my exertions."  The Housedog replied, 
<A NAME="180"></A>"Do not blame me, my friend, but find fault with the master, who has not 
<A NAME="181"></A>taught me to labor, but to depend for subsistence on the labor of 
<A NAME="182"></A>others."
<A NAME="183"></A><BR><BR>Children are not to be blamed for the faults of their 
<A NAME="184"></A>parents.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="185"></A><B>The Stag in the Ox-Stall</B>

<A NAME="186"></A><BR><BR>A Stag, roundly chased by the hounds and blinded by fear to the 
<A NAME="187"></A>danger he was running into, took shelter in a farmyard and hid himself 
<A NAME="188"></A>in a shed among the oxen.  An Ox gave him this kindly warning:  "O unhappy 
<A NAME="189"></A>creature! why should you thus, of your own accord, incur destruction and 
<A NAME="190"></A>trust yourself in the house of your enemy?'  The Stag replied:  "Only allow 
<A NAME="191"></A>me, friend, to stay where I am, and I will undertake to find some favorable 
<A NAME="192"></A>opportunity of effecting my escape."  At the approach of the evening the 
<A NAME="193"></A>herdsman came to feed his cattle, but did not see the Stag; and even the 
<A NAME="194"></A>farm-bailiff with several laborers passed through the shed and failed to 
<A NAME="195"></A>notice him.  The Stag, congratulating himself on his safety, began to express 
<A NAME="196"></A>his sincere thanks to the Oxen who had kindly helped him in the hour of 
<A NAME="197"></A>need.  One of them again answered him:  "We indeed wish you well, but the 
<A NAME="198"></A>danger is not over.  There is one other yet to pass through the shed, who 
<A NAME="199"></A>has as it were a hundred eyes, and until he has come and gone, your life 
<A NAME="200"></A>is still in peril."  At that moment the master himself entered, and having 
<A NAME="201"></A>had to complain that his oxen had not been properly fed, he went up to 
<A NAME="202"></A>their racks and cried out:  "Why is there such a scarcity of fodder? There 
<A NAME="203"></A>is not half enough straw for them to lie on.  Those lazy fellows have not 
<A NAME="204"></A>even swept the cobwebs away."  While he thus examined everything in turn, 
<A NAME="205"></A>he spied the tips of the antlers of the Stag peeping out of the straw. 
<A NAME="206"></A> Then summoning his laborers, he ordered that the Stag should be seized 
<A NAME="207"></A>and killed.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="208"></A><B>The Hawk, the Kite, and the Pigeons</B>

<A NAME="209"></A><BR><BR>The Pigeons, terrified by the appearance of a Kite, called upon 
<A NAME="210"></A>the Hawk to defend them.  He at once consented.  When they had admitted 
<A NAME="211"></A>him into the cote, they found that he made more havoc and slew a larger 
<A NAME="212"></A>number of them in one day than the Kite could pounce upon in a whole 
<A NAME="213"></A>year.
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR>Avoid a remedy that is worse than the disease.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="215"></A><B>The Widow and the Sheep</B>

<A NAME="216"></A><BR><BR>A certain poor widow had one solitary Sheep.  At shearing time, 
<A NAME="217"></A>wishing to take his fleece and to avoid expense, she sheared him herself, 
<A NAME="218"></A>but used the shears so unskillfully that with the fleece she sheared the 
<A NAME="219"></A>flesh.  The Sheep, writhing with pain, said, "Why do you hurt me so, Mistress? 
<A NAME="220"></A>What weight can my blood add to the wool? If you want my flesh, there is 
<A NAME="221"></A>the butcher, who will kill me in an instant; but if you want my fleece 
<A NAME="222"></A>and wool, there is the shearer, who will shear and not hurt 
<A NAME="223"></A>me."
<A NAME="224"></A><BR><BR>The least outlay is not always the greatest 
<A NAME="225"></A>gain.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="226"></A><B>The Wild Ass and the Lion</B>

<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR>A Wild Ass and a Lion entered into an alliance so that they might 
<A NAME="228"></A>capture the beasts of the forest with greater ease.  The Lion agreed to 
<A NAME="229"></A>assist the Wild Ass with his strength, while the Wild Ass gave the Lion 
<A NAME="230"></A>the benefit of his greater speed.  When they had taken as many beasts as 
<A NAME="231"></A>their necessities required, the Lion undertook to distribute the prey, 
<A NAME="232"></A>and for this purpose divided it into three shares.  "I will take the first 
<A NAME="233"></A>share," he said, "because I am King:  and the second share, as a partner 
<A NAME="234"></A>with you in the chase:  and the third share (believe me) will be a source 
<A NAME="235"></A>of great evil to you, unless you willingly resign it to me, and set off 
<A NAME="236"></A>as fast as you can."
<A NAME="237"></A><BR><BR>Might makes right.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="238"></A><B>The Eagle and the Arrow</B>

<A NAME="239"></A><BR><BR>An Eagle sat on a lofty rock, watching the movements of a Hare 
<A NAME="240"></A>whom he sought to make his prey.  An archer, who saw the Eagle from a place 
<A NAME="241"></A>of concealment, took an accurate aim and wounded him mortally.  The Eagle 
<A NAME="242"></A>gave one look at the arrow that had entered his heart and saw in that single 
<A NAME="243"></A>glance that its feathers had been furnished by himself.  "It is a double 
<A NAME="244"></A>grief to me," he exclaimed, "that I should perish by an arrow feathered 
<A NAME="245"></A>from my own wings."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="246"></A><B>The Sick Kite</B>

<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR>A Kite, sick unto death, said to his mother:  "O Mother! do not 
<A NAME="248"></A>mourn, but at once invoke the gods that my life may be prolonged."  She 
<A NAME="249"></A>replied, "Alas! my son, which of the gods do you think will pity you? Is 
<A NAME="250"></A>there one whom you have not outraged by filching from their very altars 
<A NAME="251"></A>a part of the sacrifice offered up to them?'
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR>We must make friends in prosperity if we would have their help 
<A NAME="253"></A>in adversity.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="254"></A><B>The Lion and the Dolphin</B>

<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR>A Lion roaming by the seashore saw a Dolphin lift up its head out 
<A NAME="256"></A>of the waves, and suggested that they contract an alliance, saying that 
<A NAME="257"></A>of all the animals they ought to be the best friends, since the one was 
<A NAME="258"></A>the king of beasts on the earth, and the other was the sovereign ruler 
<A NAME="259"></A>of all the inhabitants of the ocean.  The Dolphin gladly consented to this 
<A NAME="260"></A>request.  Not long afterwards the Lion had a combat with a wild bull, and 
<A NAME="261"></A>called on the Dolphin to help him.  The Dolphin, though quite willing to 
<A NAME="262"></A>give him assistance, was unable to do so, as he could not by any means 
<A NAME="263"></A>reach the land.  The Lion abused him as a traitor.  The Dolphin replied, 
<A NAME="264"></A>"Nay, my friend, blame not me, but Nature, which, while giving me the sovereignty 
<A NAME="265"></A>of the sea, has quite denied me the power of living upon the 
<A NAME="266"></A>land."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="267"></A><B>The Lion and the Boar</B>

<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR>On a summer day, when the great heat induced a general thirst among 
<A NAME="269"></A>the beasts, a Lion and a Boar came at the same moment to a small well to 
<A NAME="270"></A>drink.  They fiercely disputed which of them should drink first, and were 
<A NAME="271"></A>soon engaged in the agonies of a mortal combat.  When they stopped suddenly 
<A NAME="272"></A>to catch their breath for a fiercer renewal of the fight, they saw some 
<A NAME="273"></A>Vultures waiting in the distance to feast on the one that should fall first. 
<A NAME="274"></A> They at once made up their quarrel, saying, "It is better for us to make 
<A NAME="275"></A>friends, than to become the food of Crows or Vultures."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="276"></A><B>The One-Eyed Doe</B>

<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR>A Doe blind in one eye was accustomed to graze as near to the edge 
<A NAME="278"></A>of the cliff as she possibly could, in the hope of securing her greater 
<A NAME="279"></A>safety.  She turned her sound eye towards the land that she might get the 
<A NAME="280"></A>earliest tidings of the approach of hunter or hound, and her injured eye 
<A NAME="281"></A>towards the sea, from whence she entertained no anticipation of danger. 
<A NAME="282"></A> Some boatmen sailing by saw her, and taking a successful aim, mortally 
<A NAME="283"></A>wounded her. Yielding up her last breath, she gasped forth this lament: 
<A NAME="284"></A> "O wretched creature that I am! to take such precaution against the land, 
<A NAME="285"></A>and after all to find this seashore, to which I had come for safety, so 
<A NAME="286"></A>much more perilous."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="287"></A><B>The Shepherd and the Sea</B>

<A NAME="288"></A><BR><BR>A Shepherd, keeping watch over his sheep near the shore, saw the 
<A NAME="289"></A>Sea very calm and smooth, and longed to make a voyage with a view to commerce. 
<A NAME="290"></A> He sold all his flock, invested it in a cargo of dates, and set sail. 
<A NAME="291"></A> But a very great tempest came on, and the ship being in danger of sinking, 
<A NAME="292"></A>he threw all his merchandise overboard, and barely escaped with his life 
<A NAME="293"></A>in the empty ship. Not long afterwards when someone passed by and observed 
<A NAME="294"></A>the unruffled calm of the Sea, he interrupted him and said, "It is again 
<A NAME="295"></A>in want of dates, and therefore looks quiet."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="296"></A><B>The Ass, the Cock, and the Lion</B>

<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR>An Ass and a Cock were in a straw-yard together when a Lion, desperate 
<A NAME="298"></A>from hunger, approached the spot.  He was about to spring upon the Ass, 
<A NAME="299"></A>when the Cock (to the sound of whose voice the Lion, it is said, has a 
<A NAME="300"></A>singular aversion) crowed loudly, and the Lion fled away as fast as he 
<A NAME="301"></A>could.  The Ass, observing his trepidation at the mere crowing of a Cock 
<A NAME="302"></A>summoned courage to attack him, and galloped after him for that purpose. 
<A NAME="303"></A> He had run no long distance, when the Lion, turning about, seized him 
<A NAME="304"></A>and tore him to pieces.
<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR>False confidence often leads into danger.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="306"></A><B>The Mice and the Weasels</B>

<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR>The Weasels and the Mice waged a perpetual war with each other, 
<A NAME="308"></A>in which much blood was shed.  The Weasels were always the victors.  The 
<A NAME="309"></A>Mice thought that the cause of their frequent defeats was that they had 
<A NAME="310"></A>no leaders set apart from the general army to command them, and that they 
<A NAME="311"></A>were exposed to dangers from lack of discipline.  They therefore chose 
<A NAME="312"></A>as leaders Mice that were most renowned for their family descent, strength, 
<A NAME="313"></A>and counsel, as well as those most noted for their courage in the fight, 
<A NAME="314"></A>so that they might be better marshaled in battle array and formed into 
<A NAME="315"></A>troops, regiments, and battalions.  When all this was done, and the army 
<A NAME="316"></A>disciplined, and the herald Mouse had duly proclaimed war by challenging 
<A NAME="317"></A>the Weasels, the newly chosen generals bound their heads with straws, that 
<A NAME="318"></A>they might be more conspicuous to all their troops.  Scarcely had the battle 
<A NAME="319"></A>begun, when a great rout overwhelmed the Mice, who scampered off as fast 
<A NAME="320"></A>as they could to their holes.  The generals, not being able to get in on 
<A NAME="321"></A>account of the ornaments on their heads, were all captured and eaten by 
<A NAME="322"></A>the Weasels.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR><BR>The more honor the more danger.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="324"></A><B>The Mice in Council</B>

<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR>The Mice summoned a council to decide how they might best devise 
<A NAME="326"></A>means of warning themselves of the approach of their great enemy the Cat. 
<A NAME="327"></A> Among the many plans suggested, the one that found most favor was the 
<A NAME="328"></A>proposal to tie a bell to the neck of the Cat, so that the Mice, being 
<A NAME="329"></A>warned by the sound of the tinkling, might run away and hide themselves 
<A NAME="330"></A>in their holes at his approach.  But when the Mice further debated who 
<A NAME="331"></A>among them should thus "bell the Cat," there was no one found to do 
<A NAME="332"></A>it.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="333"></A><B>The Wolf and the Housedog</B>

<A NAME="334"></A><BR><BR>A Wolf, meeting a big well-fed Mastiff with a wooden collar about 
<A NAME="335"></A>his neck asked him who it was that fed him so well and yet compelled him 
<A NAME="336"></A>to drag that heavy log about wherever he went. "The master," he replied. 
<A NAME="337"></A> Then said the Wolf:  "May no friend of mine ever be in such a plight; 
<A NAME="338"></A>for the weight of this chain is enough to spoil the 
<A NAME="339"></A>appetite."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="340"></A><B>The Rivers and the Sea</B>

<A NAME="341"></A><BR><BR>The Rivers joined together to complain to the Sea, saying, "Why 
<A NAME="342"></A>is it that when we flow into your tides so potable and sweet, you work 
<A NAME="343"></A>in us such a change, and make us salty and unfit to drink?" The Sea, perceiving 
<A NAME="344"></A>that they intended to throw the blame on him, said, "Pray cease to flow 
<A NAME="345"></A>into me, and then you will not be made briny."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="346"></A><B>The Playful Ass</B>

<A NAME="347"></A><BR><BR>An Ass climbed up to the roof of a building, and frisking about 
<A NAME="348"></A>there, broke in the tiling.  The owner went up after him and quickly drove 
<A NAME="349"></A>him down, beating him severely with a thick wooden cudgel.  The Ass said, 
<A NAME="350"></A>"Why, I saw the Monkey do this very thing yesterday, and you all laughed 
<A NAME="351"></A>heartily, as if it afforded you very great amusement."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="352"></A><B>The Three Tradesmen</B>

<A NAME="353"></A><BR><BR>A great city was besieged, and its inhabitants were called together 
<A NAME="354"></A>to consider the best means of protecting it from the enemy.  A Bricklayer 
<A NAME="355"></A>earnestly recommended bricks as affording the best material for an effective 
<A NAME="356"></A>resistance.  A Carpenter, with equal enthusiasm, proposed timber as a preferable 
<A NAME="357"></A>method of defense.  Upon which a Currier stood up and said, "Sirs, I differ 
<A NAME="358"></A>from you altogether:  there is no material for resistance equal to a covering 
<A NAME="359"></A>of hides; and nothing so good as leather."
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR>Every man for himself.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="361"></A><B>The Master and His Dogs</B>

<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR>A certain man, detained by a storm in his country house, first 
<A NAME="363"></A>of all killed his sheep, and then his goats, for the maintenance of his 
<A NAME="364"></A>household.  The storm still continuing, he was obliged to slaughter his 
<A NAME="365"></A>yoke oxen for food.  On seeing this, his Dogs took counsel together, and 
<A NAME="366"></A>said, "It is time for us to be off, for if the master spare not his oxen, 
<A NAME="367"></A>who work for his gain, how can we expect him to spare 
<A NAME="368"></A>us?'
<A NAME="369"></A><BR><BR>He is not to be trusted as a friend who mistreats his own 
<A NAME="370"></A>family.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="371"></A><B>The Wolf and the Shepherds</B>

<A NAME="372"></A><BR><BR>A Wolf, passing by, saw some Shepherds in a hut eating a haunch 
<A NAME="373"></A>of mutton for their dinner.  Approaching them, he said, "What a clamor 
<A NAME="374"></A>you would raise if I were to do as you are doing!"
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="375"></A><B>The Dolphins, the Whales, and the Sprat</B>

<A NAME="376"></A><BR><BR>The Dolphins and Whales waged a fierce war with each other.  When 
<A NAME="377"></A>the battle was at its height, a Sprat lifted its head out of the waves 
<A NAME="378"></A>and said that he would reconcile their differences if they would accept 
<A NAME="379"></A>him as an umpire.  One of the Dolphins replied, "We would far rather be 
<A NAME="380"></A>destroyed in our battle with each other than admit any interference from 
<A NAME="381"></A>you in our affairs."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="382"></A><B>The Ass Carrying the Image</B>

<A NAME="383"></A><BR><BR>An Ass once carried through the streets of a city a famous wooden 
<A NAME="384"></A>Image, to be placed in one of its Temples.  As he passed along, the crowd 
<A NAME="385"></A>made lowly prostration before the Image.  The Ass, thinking that they bowed 
<A NAME="386"></A>their heads in token of respect for himself, bristled up with pride, gave 
<A NAME="387"></A>himself airs, and refused to move another step.  The driver, seeing him 
<A NAME="388"></A>thus stop, laid his whip lustily about his shoulders and said, "O you perverse 
<A NAME="389"></A>dull-head! it is not yet come to this, that men pay worship to an 
<A NAME="390"></A>Ass."
<A NAME="391"></A><BR><BR>They are not wise who give to themselves the credit due to 
<A NAME="392"></A>others.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="393"></A><B>The Two Travelers and the Axe</B>

<A NAME="394"></A><BR><BR>Two men were journeying together.  One of them picked up an axe 
<A NAME="395"></A>that lay upon the path, and said, "I have found an axe."  "Nay, my friend," 
<A NAME="396"></A>replied the other, "do not say 'I,' but 'We' have found an axe."  They 
<A NAME="397"></A>had not gone far before they saw the owner of the axe pursuing them, and 
<A NAME="398"></A>he who had picked up the axe said, "We are undone."  "Nay," replied the 
<A NAME="399"></A>other, "keep to your first mode of speech, my friend; what you thought 
<A NAME="400"></A>right then, think right now. Say 'I,' not 'We' are undone."
<A NAME="401"></A><BR><BR>He who shares the danger ought to share the 
<A NAME="402"></A>prize.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="403"></A><B>The Old Lion</B>

<A NAME="404"></A><BR><BR>A Lion, worn out with years and powerless from disease, lay on 
<A NAME="405"></A>the ground at the point of death.  A Boar rushed upon him, and avenged 
<A NAME="406"></A>with a stroke of his tusks a long-remembered injury. Shortly afterwards 
<A NAME="407"></A>the Bull with his horns gored him as if he were an enemy.  When the Ass 
<A NAME="408"></A>saw that the huge beast could be assailed with impunity, he let drive at 
<A NAME="409"></A>his forehead with his heels.  The expiring Lion said, "I have reluctantly 
<A NAME="410"></A>brooked the insults of the brave, but to be compelled to endure such treatment 
<A NAME="411"></A>from thee, a disgrace to Nature, is indeed to die a double 
<A NAME="412"></A>death."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="413"></A><B>The Old Hound</B>

<A NAME="414"></A><BR><BR>A Hound, who in the days of his youth and strength had never yielded 
<A NAME="415"></A>to any beast of the forest, encountered in his old age a boar in the chase. 
<A NAME="416"></A> He seized him boldly by the ear, but could not retain his hold because 
<A NAME="417"></A>of the decay of his teeth, so that the boar escaped.  His master, quickly 
<A NAME="418"></A>coming up, was very much disappointed, and fiercely abused the dog.  The 
<A NAME="419"></A>Hound looked up and said, "It was not my fault.  master:  my spirit was 
<A NAME="420"></A>as good as ever, but I could not help my infirmities.  I rather deserve 
<A NAME="421"></A>to be praised for what I have been, than to be blamed for what I 
<A NAME="422"></A>am."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="423"></A><B>The Bee and Jupiter</B>

<A NAME="424"></A><BR><BR>A Bee from Mount Hymettus, the queen of the hive, ascended to Olympus 
<A NAME="425"></A>to present Jupiter some honey fresh from her combs. Jupiter, delighted 
<A NAME="426"></A>with the offering of honey, promised to give whatever she should ask. 
<A NAME="427"></A> She therefore besought him, saying, "Give me, I pray thee, a sting, that 
<A NAME="428"></A>if any mortal shall approach to take my honey, I may kill him."  Jupiter 
<A NAME="429"></A>was much displeased, for he loved the race of man, but could not refuse 
<A NAME="430"></A>the request because of his promise.  He thus answered the Bee:  "You shall 
<A NAME="431"></A>have your request, but it will be at the peril of your own life. For if 
<A NAME="432"></A>you use your sting, it shall remain in the wound you make, and then you 
<A NAME="433"></A>will die from the loss of it."
<A NAME="434"></A><BR><BR>Evil wishes, like chickens, come home to roost.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="435"></A><B>The Milk-Woman and Her Pail</B>

<A NAME="436"></A><BR><BR>A farmer's daughter was carrying her Pail of milk from the field 
<A NAME="437"></A>to the farmhouse, when she fell a-musing.  "The money for which this milk 
<A NAME="438"></A>will be sold, will buy at least three hundred eggs. The eggs, allowing 
<A NAME="439"></A>for all mishaps, will produce two hundred and fifty chickens.  The chickens 
<A NAME="440"></A>will become ready for the market when poultry will fetch the highest price, 
<A NAME="441"></A>so that by the end of the year I shall have money enough from my share 
<A NAME="442"></A>to buy a new gown.  In this dress I will go to the Christmas parties, where 
<A NAME="443"></A>all the young fellows will propose to me, but I will toss my head and refuse 
<A NAME="444"></A>them every one."  At this moment she tossed her head in unison with her 
<A NAME="445"></A>thoughts, when down fell the milk pail to the ground, and all her imaginary 
<A NAME="446"></A>schemes perished in a moment.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="447"></A><B>The Seaside Travelers</B>

<A NAME="448"></A><BR><BR>Some Travelers, journeying along the seashore, climbed to the summit 
<A NAME="449"></A>of a tall cliff, and looking over the sea, saw in the distance what they 
<A NAME="450"></A>thought was a large ship.  They waited in the hope of seeing it enter the 
<A NAME="451"></A>harbor, but as the object on which they looked was driven nearer to shore 
<A NAME="452"></A>by the wind, they found that it could at the most be a small boat, and 
<A NAME="453"></A>not a ship.  When however it reached the beach, they discovered that it 
<A NAME="454"></A>was only a large faggot of sticks, and one of them said to his companions, 
<A NAME="455"></A>"We have waited for no purpose, for after all there is nothing to see but 
<A NAME="456"></A>a load of wood."
<A NAME="457"></A><BR><BR>Our mere anticipations of life outrun its realities.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="458"></A><B>The Brazier and His Dog</B>

<A NAME="459"></A><BR><BR>A Brazier had a little Dog, which was a great favorite with his 
<A NAME="460"></A>master, and his constant companion.  While he hammered away at his metals 
<A NAME="461"></A>the Dog slept; but when, on the other hand, he went to dinner and began 
<A NAME="462"></A>to eat, the Dog woke up and wagged his tail, as if he would ask for a share 
<A NAME="463"></A>of his meal.  His master one day, pretending to be angry and shaking his 
<A NAME="464"></A>stick at him, said, "You wretched little sluggard! what shall I do to you? 
<A NAME="465"></A>While I am hammering on the anvil, you sleep on the mat; and when I begin 
<A NAME="466"></A>to eat after my toil, you wake up and wag your tail for food.  Do you not 
<A NAME="467"></A>know that labor is the source of every blessing, and that none but those 
<A NAME="468"></A>who work are entitled to eat?'
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="469"></A><B>The Ass and His Shadow</B>

<A NAME="470"></A><BR><BR>A Traveler hired an Ass to convey him to a distant place.  The 
<A NAME="471"></A>day being intensely hot, and the sun shining in its strength, the Traveler 
<A NAME="472"></A>stopped to rest, and sought shelter from the heat under the Shadow of the 
<A NAME="473"></A>Ass.  As this afforded only protection for one, and as the Traveler and 
<A NAME="474"></A>the owner of the Ass both claimed it, a violent dispute arose between them 
<A NAME="475"></A>as to which of them had the right to the Shadow.  The owner maintained 
<A NAME="476"></A>that he had let the Ass only, and not his Shadow.  The Traveler asserted 
<A NAME="477"></A>that he had, with the hire of the Ass, hired his Shadow also.  The quarrel 
<A NAME="478"></A>proceeded from words to blows, and while the men fought, the Ass galloped 
<A NAME="479"></A>off.
<A NAME="480"></A><BR><BR>In quarreling about the shadow we often lose the 
<A NAME="481"></A>substance.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="482"></A><B>The Ass and His Masters</B>

<A NAME="483"></A><BR><BR>An Ass, belonging to an herb-seller who gave him too little food 
<A NAME="484"></A>and too much work made a petition to Jupiter to be released from his present 
<A NAME="485"></A>service and provided with another master.  Jupiter, after warning him that 
<A NAME="486"></A>he would repent his request, caused him to be sold to a tile-maker.  Shortly 
<A NAME="487"></A>afterwards, finding that he had heavier loads to carry and harder work 
<A NAME="488"></A>in the brick-field, he petitioned for another change of master.  Jupiter, 
<A NAME="489"></A>telling him that it would be the last time that he could grant his request, 
<A NAME="490"></A>ordained that he be sold to a tanner.  The Ass found that he had fallen 
<A NAME="491"></A>into worse hands, and noting his master's occupation, said, groaning: 
<A NAME="492"></A> "It would have been better for me to have been either starved by the one, 
<A NAME="493"></A>or to have been overworked by the other of my former masters, than to have 
<A NAME="494"></A>been bought by my present owner, who will even after I am dead tan my hide, 
<A NAME="495"></A>and make me useful to him."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="496"></A><B>The Oak and the Reeds</B>

<A NAME="497"></A><BR><BR>A very large Oak was uprooted by the wind and thrown across a stream. 
<A NAME="498"></A> It fell among some Reeds, which it thus addressed:  "I wonder how you, 
<A NAME="499"></A>who are so light and weak, are not entirely crushed by these strong winds." 
<A NAME="500"></A> They replied, "You fight and contend with the wind, and consequently you 
<A NAME="501"></A>are destroyed; while we on the contrary bend before the least breath of 
<A NAME="502"></A>air, and therefore remain unbroken, and escape."
<A NAME="503"></A><BR><BR>Stoop to conquer.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="504"></A><B>The Fisherman and the Little Fish</B>

<A NAME="505"></A><BR><BR>A Fisherman who lived on the produce of his nets, one day caught 
<A NAME="506"></A>a single small Fish as the result of his day's labor.  The Fish, panting 
<A NAME="507"></A>convulsively, thus entreated for his life:  "O Sir, what good can I be 
<A NAME="508"></A>to you, and how little am I worth? I am not yet come to my full size. 
<A NAME="509"></A> Pray spare my life, and put me back into the sea.  I shall soon become 
<A NAME="510"></A>a large fish fit for the tables of the rich, and then you can catch me 
<A NAME="511"></A>again, and make a handsome profit of me."  The Fisherman replied, "I should 
<A NAME="512"></A>indeed be a very simple fellow if, for the chance of a greater uncertain 
<A NAME="513"></A>profit, I were to forego my present certain gain."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="514"></A><B>The Hunter and the Woodman</B>

<A NAME="515"></A><BR><BR>A Hunter, not very bold, was searching for the tracks of a Lion. 
<A NAME="516"></A>He asked a man felling oaks in the forest if he had seen any marks of his 
<A NAME="517"></A>footsteps or knew where his lair was.  "I will," said the man, "at once 
<A NAME="518"></A>show you the Lion himself."  The Hunter, turning very pale and chattering 
<A NAME="519"></A>with his teeth from fear, replied, "No, thank you.  I did not ask that; 
<A NAME="520"></A>it is his track only I am in search of, not the Lion 
<A NAME="521"></A>himself."
<A NAME="522"></A><BR><BR>The hero is brave in deeds as well as words.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="523"></A><B>The Wild Boar and the Fox</B>

<A NAME="524"></A><BR><BR>A Wild Boar stood under a tree and rubbed his tusks against the 
<A NAME="525"></A>trunk.  A Fox passing by asked him why he thus sharpened his teeth when 
<A NAME="526"></A>there was no danger threatening from either huntsman or hound.  He replied, 
<A NAME="527"></A>"I do it advisedly; for it would never do to have to sharpen my weapons 
<A NAME="528"></A>just at the time I ought to be using them."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="529"></A><B>The Lion in a Farmyard</B>

<A NAME="530"></A><BR><BR>A Lion entered a farmyard.  The Farmer, wishing to catch him, shut 
<A NAME="531"></A>the gate.  When the Lion found that he could not escape, he flew upon the 
<A NAME="532"></A>sheep and killed them, and then attacked the oxen. The Farmer, beginning 
<A NAME="533"></A>to be alarmed for his own safety, opened the gate and released the Lion. 
<A NAME="534"></A> On his departure the Farmer grievously lamented the destruction of his 
<A NAME="535"></A>sheep and oxen, but his wife, who had been a spectator to all that took 
<A NAME="536"></A>place, said, "On my word, you are rightly served, for how could you for 
<A NAME="537"></A>a moment think of shutting up a Lion along with you in your farmyard when 
<A NAME="538"></A>you know that you shake in your shoes if you only hear his roar at a distance?' 
<A NAME="539"></A>Mercury and the Sculptor
<A NAME="540"></A><BR><BR>Mercury once determined to learn in what esteem he was held among 
<A NAME="541"></A>mortals.  For this purpose he assumed the character of a man and visited 
<A NAME="542"></A>in this disguise a Sculptor's studio having looked at various statues, 
<A NAME="543"></A>he demanded the price of two figures of Jupiter and Juno.  When the sum 
<A NAME="544"></A>at which they were valued was named, he pointed to a figure of himself, 
<A NAME="545"></A>saying to the Sculptor, "You will certainly want much more for this, as 
<A NAME="546"></A>it is the statue of the Messenger of the Gods, and author of all your gain." 
<A NAME="547"></A> The Sculptor replied, "Well, if you will buy these, I'll fling you that 
<A NAME="548"></A>into the bargain."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="549"></A><B>The Swan and the Goose</B>

<A NAME="550"></A><BR><BR>A certain rich man bought in the market a Goose and a Swan.  He 
<A NAME="551"></A>fed the one for his table and kept the other for the sake of its song. 
<A NAME="552"></A> When the time came for killing the Goose, the cook went to get him at 
<A NAME="553"></A>night, when it was dark, and he was not able to distinguish one bird from 
<A NAME="554"></A>the other.  By mistake he caught the Swan instead of the Goose.  The Swan, 
<A NAME="555"></A>threatened with death, burst forth into song and thus made himself known 
<A NAME="556"></A>by his voice, and preserved his life by his melody.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="557"></A><B>The Swollen Fox</B>

<A NAME="558"></A><BR><BR>A very hungry Fox, seeing some bread and meat left by shepherds 
<A NAME="559"></A>in the hollow of an oak, crept into the hole and made a hearty meal.  When 
<A NAME="560"></A>he finished, he was so full that he was not able to get out, and began 
<A NAME="561"></A>to groan and lament his fate.  Another Fox passing by heard his cries, 
<A NAME="562"></A>and coming up, inquired the cause of his complaining.  On learning what 
<A NAME="563"></A>had happened, he said to him, "Ah, you will have to remain there, my friend, 
<A NAME="564"></A>until you become such as you were when you crept in, and then you will 
<A NAME="565"></A>easily get out."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="566"></A><B>The Fox and the Woodcutter</B>

<A NAME="567"></A><BR><BR>A Fox, running before the hounds, came across a Woodcutter felling 
<A NAME="568"></A>an oak and begged him to show him a safe hiding-place. The Woodcutter advised 
<A NAME="569"></A>him to take shelter in his own hut, so the Fox crept in and hid himself 
<A NAME="570"></A>in a corner.  The huntsman soon came up with his hounds and inquired of 
<A NAME="571"></A>the Woodcutter if he had seen the Fox.  He declared that he had not seen 
<A NAME="572"></A>him, and yet pointed, all the time he was speaking, to the hut where the 
<A NAME="573"></A>Fox lay hidden.  The huntsman took no notice of the signs, but believing 
<A NAME="574"></A>his word, hastened forward in the chase.  As soon as they were well away, 
<A NAME="575"></A>the Fox departed without taking any notice of the Woodcutter:  whereon 
<A NAME="576"></A>he called to him and reproached him, saying, "You ungrateful fellow, you 
<A NAME="577"></A>owe your life to me, and yet you leave me without a word of thanks."  The 
<A NAME="578"></A>Fox replied, "Indeed, I should have thanked you fervently if your deeds 
<A NAME="579"></A>had been as good as your words, and if your hands had not been traitors 
<A NAME="580"></A>to your speech."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="581"></A><B>The Birdcatcher, the Partridge, and the Cock</B>

<A NAME="582"></A><BR><BR>A Birdcatcher was about to sit down to a dinner of herbs when a 
<A NAME="583"></A>friend unexpectedly came in.  The bird-trap was quite empty, as he had 
<A NAME="584"></A>caught nothing, and he had to kill a pied Partridge, which he had tamed 
<A NAME="585"></A>for a decoy.  The bird entreated earnestly for his life:  "What would you 
<A NAME="586"></A>do without me when next you spread your nets? Who would chirp you to sleep, 
<A NAME="587"></A>or call for you the covey of answering birds?'  The Birdcatcher spared 
<A NAME="588"></A>his life, and determined to pick out a fine young Cock just attaining to 
<A NAME="589"></A>his comb.  But the Cock expostulated in piteous tones from his perch: 
<A NAME="590"></A> "If you kill me, who will announce to you the appearance of the dawn? 
<A NAME="591"></A>Who will wake you to your daily tasks or tell you when it is time to visit 
<A NAME="592"></A>the bird-trap in the morning?'  He replied, "What you say is true.  You 
<A NAME="593"></A>are a capital bird at telling the time of day.  But my friend and I must 
<A NAME="594"></A>have our dinners."
<A NAME="595"></A><BR><BR>Necessity knows no law.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="596"></A><B>The Monkey and the Fishermen</B>

<A NAME="597"></A><BR><BR>A Monkey perched upon a lofty tree saw some Fishermen casting their 
<A NAME="598"></A>nets into a river, and narrowly watched their proceedings. The Fishermen 
<A NAME="599"></A>after a while gave up fishing, and on going home to dinner left their nets 
<A NAME="600"></A>upon the bank.  The Monkey, who is the most imitative of animals, descended 
<A NAME="601"></A>from the treetop and endeavored to do as they had done.  Having handled 
<A NAME="602"></A>the net, he threw it into the river, but became tangled in the meshes and 
<A NAME="603"></A>drowned.  With his last breath he said to himself, "I am rightly served; 
<A NAME="604"></A>for what business had I who had never handled a net to try and catch 
<A NAME="605"></A>fish?'
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="606"></A><B>The Flea and the Wrestler</B>

<A NAME="607"></A><BR><BR>A Flea settled upon the bare foot of a Wrestler and bit him, causing 
<A NAME="608"></A>the man to call loudly upon Hercules for help.  When the Flea a second 
<A NAME="609"></A>time hopped upon his foot, he groaned and said, "O Hercules! if you will 
<A NAME="610"></A>not help me against a Flea, how can I hope for your assistance against 
<A NAME="611"></A>greater antagonists?'
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="612"></A><B>The Two Frogs</B>

<A NAME="613"></A><BR><BR>Two Frogs dwelt in the same pool.  When the pool dried up under 
<A NAME="614"></A>the summer's heat, they left it and set out together for another home. 
<A NAME="615"></A> As they went along they chanced to pass a deep well, amply supplied with 
<A NAME="616"></A>water, and when they saw it, one of the Frogs said to the other, "Let us 
<A NAME="617"></A>descend and make our abode in this well:  it will furnish us with shelter 
<A NAME="618"></A>and food."  The other replied with greater caution, "But suppose the water 
<A NAME="619"></A>should fail us.  How can we get out again from so great a 
<A NAME="620"></A>depth?'
<A NAME="621"></A><BR><BR>Do nothing without a regard to the consequences.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="622"></A><B>The Cat and the Mice</B>

<A NAME="623"></A><BR><BR>A certain house was overrun with Mice.  A Cat, discovering this, 
<A NAME="624"></A>made her way into it and began to catch and eat them one by one. Fearing 
<A NAME="625"></A>for their lives, the Mice kept themselves close in their holes.  The Cat 
<A NAME="626"></A>was no longer able to get at them and perceived that she must tempt them 
<A NAME="627"></A>forth by some device.  For this purpose she jumped upon a peg, and suspending 
<A NAME="628"></A>herself from it, pretended to be dead.  One of the Mice, peeping stealthily 
<A NAME="629"></A>out, saw her and said, "Ah, my good madam, even though you should turn 
<A NAME="630"></A>into a meal-bag, we will not come near you."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="631"></A><B>The Lion, the Bear, and the Fox</B>

<A NAME="632"></A><BR><BR>A Lion and a Bear seized a Kid at the same moment, and fought fiercely 
<A NAME="633"></A>for its possession.  When they had fearfully lacerated each other and were 
<A NAME="634"></A>faint from the long combat, they lay down exhausted with fatigue.  A Fox, 
<A NAME="635"></A>who had gone round them at a distance several times, saw them both stretched 
<A NAME="636"></A>on the ground with the Kid lying untouched in the middle.  He ran in between 
<A NAME="637"></A>them, and seizing the Kid scampered off as fast as he could.  The Lion 
<A NAME="638"></A>and the Bear saw him, but not being able to get up, said, "Woe be to us, 
<A NAME="639"></A>that we should have fought and belabored ourselves only to serve the turn 
<A NAME="640"></A>of a Fox."
<A NAME="641"></A><BR><BR>It sometimes happens that one man has all the toil, and another 
<A NAME="642"></A>all the profit.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="643"></A><B>The Doe and the Lion</B>

<A NAME="644"></A><BR><BR>A Doe hard pressed by hunters sought refuge in a cave belonging 
<A NAME="645"></A>to a Lion.  The Lion concealed himself on seeing her approach, but when 
<A NAME="646"></A>she was safe within the cave, sprang upon her and tore her to pieces. 
<A NAME="647"></A> "Woe is me," exclaimed the Doe, "who have escaped from man, only to throw 
<A NAME="648"></A>myself into the mouth of a wild beast?'
<A NAME="649"></A><BR><BR>In avoiding one evil, care must be taken not to fall into 
<A NAME="650"></A>another.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="651"></A><B>The Farmer and the Fox</B>

<A NAME="652"></A><BR><BR>A Farmer, who bore a grudge against a Fox for robbing his poultry 
<A NAME="653"></A>yard, caught him at last, and being determined to take an ample revenge, 
<A NAME="654"></A>tied some rope well soaked in oil to his tail, and set it on fire.  The 
<A NAME="655"></A>Fox by a strange fatality rushed to the fields of the Farmer who had captured 
<A NAME="656"></A>him.  It was the time of the wheat harvest; but the Farmer reaped nothing 
<A NAME="657"></A>that year and returned home grieving sorely.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="658"></A><B>The Seagull and the Kite</B>

<A NAME="659"></A><BR><BR>A Seagull having bolted down too large a fish, burst its deep gullet-bag 
<A NAME="660"></A>and lay down on the shore to die.  A Kite saw him and exclaimed:  "You 
<A NAME="661"></A>richly deserve your fate; for a bird of the air has no business to seek 
<A NAME="662"></A>its food from the sea."
<A NAME="663"></A><BR><BR>Every man should be content to mind his own 
<A NAME="664"></A>business.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="665"></A><B>The Philosopher, the Ants, and Mercury</B>

<A NAME="666"></A><BR><BR>A Philosopher witnessed from the shore the shipwreck of a vessel, 
<A NAME="667"></A>of which the crew and passengers were all drowned.  He inveighed against 
<A NAME="668"></A>the injustice of Providence, which would for the sake of one criminal perchance 
<A NAME="669"></A>sailing in the ship allow so many innocent persons to perish.  As he was 
<A NAME="670"></A>indulging in these reflections, he found himself surrounded by a whole 
<A NAME="671"></A>army of Ants, near whose nest he was standing.  One of them climbed up 
<A NAME="672"></A>and stung him, and he immediately trampled them all to death with his foot. 
<A NAME="673"></A> Mercury presented himself, and striking the Philosopher with his wand, 
<A NAME="674"></A>said, "And are you indeed to make yourself a judge of the dealings of Providence, 
<A NAME="675"></A>who hast thyself in a similar manner treated these poor 
<A NAME="676"></A>Ants?'
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="677"></A><B>The Mouse and the Bull</B>

<A NAME="678"></A><BR><BR>A Bull was bitten by a Mouse and, angered by the wound, tried to 
<A NAME="679"></A>capture him.  But the Mouse reached his hole in safety.  Though the Bull 
<A NAME="680"></A>dug into the walls with his horns, he tired before he could rout out the 
<A NAME="681"></A>Mouse, and crouching down, went to sleep outside the hole.  The Mouse peeped 
<A NAME="682"></A>out, crept furtively up his flank, and again biting him, retreated to his 
<A NAME="683"></A>hole.  The Bull rising up, and not knowing what to do, was sadly perplexed. 
<A NAME="684"></A> At which the Mouse said, "The great do not always prevail.  There are 
<A NAME="685"></A>times when the small and lowly are the strongest to do 
<A NAME="686"></A>mischief."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="687"></A><B>The Lion and the Hare</B>

<A NAME="688"></A><BR><BR>A Lion came across a Hare, who was fast asleep.  He was just in 
<A NAME="689"></A>the act of seizing her, when a fine young Hart trotted by, and he left 
<A NAME="690"></A>the Hare to follow him.  The Hare, scared by the noise, awoke and scudded 
<A NAME="691"></A>away.  The Lion was unable after a long chase to catch the Hart, and returned 
<A NAME="692"></A>to feed upon the Hare.  On finding that the Hare also had run off, he said, 
<A NAME="693"></A>"I am rightly served, for having let go of the food that I had in my hand 
<A NAME="694"></A>for the chance of obtaining more."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="695"></A><B>The Peasant and the Eagle</B>

<A NAME="696"></A><BR><BR>A Peasant found an Eagle captured in a trap, and much admiring 
<A NAME="697"></A>the bird, set him free.  The Eagle did not prove ungrateful to his deliverer, 
<A NAME="698"></A>for seeing the Peasant sitting under a wall which was not safe, he flew 
<A NAME="699"></A>toward him and with his talons snatched a bundle from his head.  When the 
<A NAME="700"></A>Peasant rose in pursuit, the Eagle let the bundle fall again.  Taking it 
<A NAME="701"></A>up, the man returned to the same place, to find that the wall under which 
<A NAME="702"></A>he had been sitting had fallen to pieces; and he marveled at the service 
<A NAME="703"></A>rendered him by the Eagle.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="704"></A><B>The Image of Mercury and the Carpenter</B>

<A NAME="705"></A><BR><BR>A very poor man, a Carpenter by trade, had a wooden image of Mercury, 
<A NAME="706"></A>before which he made offerings day by day, and begged the idol to make 
<A NAME="707"></A>him rich, but in spite of his entreaties he became poorer and poorer. 
<A NAME="708"></A> At last, being very angry, he took his image down from its pedestal and 
<A NAME="709"></A>dashed it against the wall. When its head was knocked off, out came a stream 
<A NAME="710"></A>of gold, which the Carpenter quickly picked up and said, "Well, I think 
<A NAME="711"></A>thou art altogether contradictory and unreasonable; for when I paid you 
<A NAME="712"></A>honor, I reaped no benefits:  but now that I maltreat you I am loaded with 
<A NAME="713"></A>an abundance of riches."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="714"></A><B>The Bull and the Goat</B>

<A NAME="715"></A><BR><BR>A Bull, escaping from a Lion, hid in a cave which some shepherds 
<A NAME="716"></A>had recently occupied.  As soon as he entered, a He-Goat left in the cave 
<A NAME="717"></A>sharply attacked him with his horns.  The Bull quietly addressed him: 
<A NAME="718"></A> "Butt away as much as you will.  I have no fear of you, but of the Lion. 
<A NAME="719"></A> Let that monster go away and I will soon let you know what is the respective 
<A NAME="720"></A>strength of a Goat and a Bull."
<A NAME="721"></A><BR><BR>It shows an evil disposition to take advantage of a friend in 
<A NAME="722"></A>distress.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="723"></A><B>The Dancing Monkeys</B>

<A NAME="724"></A><BR><BR>A Prince had some Monkeys trained to dance.  Being naturally great 
<A NAME="725"></A>mimics of men's actions, they showed themselves most apt pupils, and when 
<A NAME="726"></A>arrayed in their rich clothes and masks, they danced as well as any of 
<A NAME="727"></A>the courtiers.  The spectacle was often repeated with great applause, till 
<A NAME="728"></A>on one occasion a courtier, bent on mischief, took from his pocket a handful 
<A NAME="729"></A>of nuts and threw them upon the stage.  The Monkeys at the sight of the 
<A NAME="730"></A>nuts forgot their dancing and became (as indeed they were) Monkeys instead 
<A NAME="731"></A>of actors.  Pulling off their masks and tearing their robes, they fought 
<A NAME="732"></A>with one another for the nuts.  The dancing spectacle thus came to an end 
<A NAME="733"></A>amidst the laughter and ridicule of the audience.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="734"></A><B>The Fox and the Leopard</B>

<A NAME="735"></A><BR><BR>The Fox and the Leopard disputed which was the more beautiful of 
<A NAME="736"></A>the two.  The Leopard exhibited one by one the various spots which decorated 
<A NAME="737"></A>his skin.  But the Fox, interrupting him, said, "And how much more beautiful 
<A NAME="738"></A>than you am I, who am decorated, not in body, but in 
<A NAME="739"></A>mind."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="740"></A><B>The Monkeys and Their Mother</B>

<A NAME="741"></A><BR><BR>The Monkey, it is said, has two young ones at each birth.  The 
<A NAME="742"></A>Mother fondles one and nurtures it with the greatest affection and care, 
<A NAME="743"></A>but hates and neglects the other.  It happened once that the young one 
<A NAME="744"></A>which was caressed and loved was smothered by the too great affection of 
<A NAME="745"></A>the Mother, while the despised one was nurtured and reared in spite of 
<A NAME="746"></A>the neglect to which it was exposed.
<A NAME="747"></A><BR><BR>The best intentions will not always ensure success.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="748"></A><B>The Oaks and Jupiter</B>

<A NAME="749"></A><BR><BR>The Oaks presented a complaint to Jupiter, saying, "We bear for 
<A NAME="750"></A>no purpose the burden of life, as of all the trees that grow we are the 
<A NAME="751"></A>most continually in peril of the axe."  Jupiter made answer:  "You have 
<A NAME="752"></A>only to thank yourselves for the misfortunes to which you are exposed: 
<A NAME="753"></A> for if you did not make such excellent pillars and posts, and prove yourselves 
<A NAME="754"></A>so serviceable to the carpenters and the farmers, the axe would not so 
<A NAME="755"></A>frequently be laid to your roots."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="756"></A><B>The Hare and the Hound</B>

<A NAME="757"></A><BR><BR>A Hound started a Hare from his lair, but after a long run, gave 
<A NAME="758"></A>up the chase.  A goat-herd seeing him stop, mocked him, saying "The little 
<A NAME="759"></A>one is the best runner of the two."  The Hound replied, "You do not see 
<A NAME="760"></A>the difference between us:  I was only running for a dinner, but he for 
<A NAME="761"></A>his life."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="762"></A><B>The Traveler and Fortune</B>

<A NAME="763"></A><BR><BR>A Traveler wearied from a long journey lay down, overcome with 
<A NAME="764"></A>fatigue, on the very brink of a deep well.  Just as he was about to fall 
<A NAME="765"></A>into the water, Dame Fortune, it is said, appeared to him and waking him 
<A NAME="766"></A>from his slumber thus addressed him:  "Good Sir, pray wake up:  for if 
<A NAME="767"></A>you fall into the well, the blame will be thrown on me, and I shall get 
<A NAME="768"></A>an ill name among mortals; for I find that men are sure to impute their 
<A NAME="769"></A>calamities to me, however much by their own folly they have really brought 
<A NAME="770"></A>them on themselves."
<A NAME="771"></A><BR><BR>Everyone is more or less master of his own fate.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="772"></A><B>The Bald Knight</B>

<A NAME="773"></A><BR><BR>A Bald Knight, who wore a wig, went out to hunt.  A sudden puff 
<A NAME="774"></A>of wind blew off his hat and wig, at which a loud laugh rang forth from 
<A NAME="775"></A>his companions.  He pulled up his horse, and with great glee joined in 
<A NAME="776"></A>the joke by saying, "What a marvel it is that hairs which are not mine 
<A NAME="777"></A>should fly from me, when they have forsaken even the man on whose head 
<A NAME="778"></A>they grew."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="779"></A><B>The Shepherd and the Dog</B>

<A NAME="780"></A><BR><BR>A Shepherd penning his sheep in the fold for the night was about 
<A NAME="781"></A>to shut up a wolf with them, when his Dog perceiving the wolf said, "Master, 
<A NAME="782"></A>how can you expect the sheep to be safe if you admit a wolf into the 
<A NAME="783"></A>fold?'
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="784"></A><B>The Lamp</B>

<A NAME="785"></A><BR><BR>A Lamp, soaked with too much oil and flaring brightly, boasted 
<A NAME="786"></A>that it gave more light than the sun.  Then a sudden puff of wind arose, 
<A NAME="787"></A>and the Lamp was immediately extinguished.  Its owner lit it again, and 
<A NAME="788"></A>said:  "Boast no more, but henceforth be content to give thy light in silence. 
<A NAME="789"></A> Know that not even the stars need to be relit"
