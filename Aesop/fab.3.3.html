<A NAME="10"></A><B>The Lion, the Fox, and the Ass</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>The Lion, the Fox and the Ass entered into an agreement to assist each 
<A NAME="12"></A>other in the chase.  Having secured a large booty, the Lion on their return 
<A NAME="13"></A>from the forest asked the Ass to allot his due portion to each of the three 
<A NAME="14"></A>partners in the treaty.  The Ass carefully divided the spoil into three 
<A NAME="15"></A>equal shares and modestly requested the two others to make the first choice. 
<A NAME="16"></A> The Lion, bursting out into a great rage, devoured the Ass.  Then he requested 
<A NAME="17"></A>the Fox to do him the favor to make a division.  The Fox accumulated all 
<A NAME="18"></A>that they had killed into one large heap and left to himself the smallest 
<A NAME="19"></A>possible morsel.  The Lion said, "Who has taught you, my very excellent 
<A NAME="20"></A>fellow, the art of division? You are perfect to a fraction."  He replied, 
<A NAME="21"></A>"I learned it from the Ass, by witnessing his fate."
<A NAME="22"></A><BR><BR>Happy is the man who learns from the misfortunes of 
<A NAME="23"></A>others.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="24"></A><B>The Bull, the Lioness, and the Wild-Boar Hunter</B>

<A NAME="25"></A><BR><BR>A Bull finding a lion's cub asleep gored him to death with his 
<A NAME="26"></A>horns.  The Lioness came up, and bitterly lamented the death of her whelp. 
<A NAME="27"></A> A wild-boar Hunter, seeing her distress, stood at a distance and said 
<A NAME="28"></A>to her, "Think how many men there are who have reason to lament the loss 
<A NAME="29"></A>of their children, whose deaths have been caused by 
<A NAME="30"></A>you."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="31"></A><B>The Oak and the Woodcutter</B>

<A NAME="32"></A><BR><BR>The Woodcutter cut down a Mountain Oak and split it in pieces, 
<A NAME="33"></A>making wedges of its own branches for dividing the trunk.  The Oak said 
<A NAME="34"></A>with a sigh, "I do not care about the blows of the axe aimed at my roots, 
<A NAME="35"></A>but I do grieve at being torn in pieces by these wedges made from my own 
<A NAME="36"></A>branches."
<A NAME="37"></A><BR><BR>Misfortunes springing from ourselves are the hardest to 
<A NAME="38"></A>bear.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="39"></A><B>The Hen and the Golden Eggs</B>

<A NAME="40"></A><BR><BR>A cottager and his wife had a Hen that laid a golden egg every 
<A NAME="41"></A>day.  They supposed that the Hen must contain a great lump of gold in its 
<A NAME="42"></A>inside, and in order to get the gold they killed it. Having done so, they 
<A NAME="43"></A>found to their surprise that the Hen differed in no respect from their 
<A NAME="44"></A>other hens.  The foolish pair, thus hoping to become rich all at once, 
<A NAME="45"></A>deprived themselves of the gain of which they were assured day by 
<A NAME="46"></A>day.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="47"></A><B>The Ass and the Frogs</B>

<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>An Ass, carrying a load of wood, passed through a pond.  As he 
<A NAME="49"></A>was crossing through the water he lost his footing, stumbled and fell, 
<A NAME="50"></A>and not being able to rise on account of his load, groaned heavily.  Some 
<A NAME="51"></A>Frogs frequenting the pool heard his lamentation, and said, "What would 
<A NAME="52"></A>you do if you had to live here always as we do, when you make such a fuss 
<A NAME="53"></A>about a mere fall into the water?"
<A NAME="54"></A><BR><BR>Men often bear little grievances with less courage than they do 
<A NAME="55"></A>large misfortunes.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="56"></A><B>The Crow and the Raven</B>

<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR>A Crow was jealous of the Raven, because he was considered a bird 
<A NAME="58"></A>of good omen and always attracted the attention of men, who noted by his 
<A NAME="59"></A>flight the good or evil course of future events.  Seeing some travelers 
<A NAME="60"></A>approaching, the Crow flew up into a tree, and perching herself on one 
<A NAME="61"></A>of the branches, cawed as loudly as she could.  The travelers turned towards 
<A NAME="62"></A>the sound and wondered what it foreboded, when one of them said to his 
<A NAME="63"></A>companion, "Let us proceed on our journey, my friend, for it is only the 
<A NAME="64"></A>caw of a crow, and her cry, you know, is no omen."
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR>Those who assume a character which does not belong to them, only 
<A NAME="66"></A>make themselves ridiculous.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="67"></A><B>The Trees and the Axe</B>

<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR>A man came into a forest and asked the Trees to provide him a handle 
<A NAME="69"></A>for his axe.  The Trees consented to his request and gave him a young ash-tree. 
<A NAME="70"></A> No sooner had the man fitted a new handle to his axe from it, than he 
<A NAME="71"></A>began to use it and quickly felled with his strokes the noblest giants 
<A NAME="72"></A>of the forest.  An old oak, lamenting when too late the destruction of 
<A NAME="73"></A>his companions, said to a neighboring cedar, "The first step has lost us 
<A NAME="74"></A>all.  If we had not given up the rights of the ash, we might yet have retained 
<A NAME="75"></A>our own privileges and have stood for ages."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="76"></A><B>The Crab and the Fox</B>

<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>A Crab, forsaking the seashore, chose a neighboring green meadow 
<A NAME="78"></A>as its feeding ground.  A Fox came across him, and being very hungry ate 
<A NAME="79"></A>him up.  Just as he was on the point of being eaten, the Crab said, "I 
<A NAME="80"></A>well deserve my fate, for what business had I on the land, when by my nature 
<A NAME="81"></A>and habits I am only adapted for the sea?'
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR>Contentment with our lot is an element of happiness.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="83"></A><B>The Woman and Her Hen</B>

<A NAME="84"></A><BR><BR>A Woman possessed a Hen that gave her an egg every day.  She often 
<A NAME="85"></A>pondered how she might obtain two eggs daily instead of one, and at last, 
<A NAME="86"></A>to gain her purpose, determined to give the Hen a double allowance of barley. 
<A NAME="87"></A> From that day the Hen became fat and sleek, and never once laid another 
<A NAME="88"></A>egg.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="89"></A><B>The Ass and the Old Shepherd</B>

<A NAME="90"></A><BR><BR>A Shepherd, watching his Ass feeding in a meadow, was alarmed all 
<A NAME="91"></A>of a sudden by the cries of the enemy.  He appealed to the Ass to fly with 
<A NAME="92"></A>him, lest they should both be captured, but the animal lazily replied, 
<A NAME="93"></A>"Why should I, pray? Do you think it likely the conqueror will place on 
<A NAME="94"></A>me two sets of panniers?'  "No," rejoined the Shepherd.  "Then," said the 
<A NAME="95"></A>Ass, "as long as I carry the panniers, what matters it to me whom I 
<A NAME="96"></A>serve?'
<A NAME="97"></A><BR><BR>In a change of government the poor change nothing beyond the name 
<A NAME="98"></A>of their master.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="99"></A><B>The Kites and the Swans</B>

<A NAME="100"></A><BR><BR>The Kites of olden times, as well as the Swans, had the privilege 
<A NAME="101"></A>of song.  But having heard the neigh of the horse, they were so enchanted 
<A NAME="102"></A>with the sound, that they tried to imitate it; and, in trying to neigh, 
<A NAME="103"></A>they forgot how to sing.
<A NAME="104"></A><BR><BR>The desire for imaginary benefits often involves the loss of present 
<A NAME="105"></A>blessings.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="106"></A><B>The Wolves and the Sheepdogs</B>

<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR>The Wolves thus addressed the Sheepdogs:  "Why should you, who 
<A NAME="108"></A>are like us in so many things, not be entirely of one mind with us, and 
<A NAME="109"></A>live with us as brothers should? We differ from you in one point only. 
<A NAME="110"></A> We live in freedom, but you bow down to and slave for men, who in return 
<A NAME="111"></A>for your services flog you with whips and put collars on your necks.  They 
<A NAME="112"></A>make you also guard their sheep, and while they eat the mutton throw only 
<A NAME="113"></A>the bones to you.  If you will be persuaded by us, you will give us the 
<A NAME="114"></A>sheep, and we will enjoy them in common, till we all are surfeited."  The 
<A NAME="115"></A>Dogs listened favorably to these proposals, and, entering the den of the 
<A NAME="116"></A>Wolves, they were set upon and torn to pieces.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="117"></A><B>The Hares and the Foxes</B>

<A NAME="118"></A><BR><BR>The Hares waged war with the Eagles, and called upon the Foxes 
<A NAME="119"></A>to help them.  They replied, "We would willingly have helped you, if we 
<A NAME="120"></A>had not known who you were, and with whom you were fighting."
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR>Count the cost before you commit yourselves.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="122"></A><B>The Bowman and Lion</B>

<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>A very skillful Bowman went to the mountains in search of game, 
<A NAME="124"></A>but all the beasts of the forest fled at his approach.  The Lion alone 
<A NAME="125"></A>challenged him to combat.  The Bowman immediately shot out an arrow and 
<A NAME="126"></A>said to the Lion:  "I send thee my messenger, that from him thou mayest 
<A NAME="127"></A>learn what I myself shall be when I assail thee."  The wounded Lion rushed 
<A NAME="128"></A>away in great fear, and when a Fox who had seen it all happen told him 
<A NAME="129"></A>to be of good courage and not to back off at the first attack he replied: 
<A NAME="130"></A> "You counsel me in vain; for if he sends so fearful a messenger, how shall 
<A NAME="131"></A>I abide the attack of the man himself?'
<A NAME="132"></A><BR><BR>Be on guard against men who can strike from a 
<A NAME="133"></A>distance.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="134"></A><B>The Camel</B>

<A NAME="135"></A><BR><BR>When man first saw the Camel, he was so frightened at his vast 
<A NAME="136"></A>size that he ran away.  After a time, perceiving the meekness and gentleness 
<A NAME="137"></A>of the beast's temper, he summoned courage enough to approach him.  Soon 
<A NAME="138"></A>afterwards, observing that he was an animal altogether deficient in spirit, 
<A NAME="139"></A>he assumed such boldness as to put a bridle in his mouth, and to let a 
<A NAME="140"></A>child drive him.
<A NAME="141"></A><BR><BR>Use serves to overcome dread.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="142"></A><B>The Wasp and the Snake</B>

<A NAME="143"></A><BR><BR>A Wasp seated himself upon the head of a Snake and, striking him 
<A NAME="144"></A>unceasingly with his stings, wounded him to death.  The Snake, being in 
<A NAME="145"></A>great torment and not knowing how to rid himself of his enemy, saw a wagon 
<A NAME="146"></A>heavily laden with wood, and went and purposely placed his head under the 
<A NAME="147"></A>wheels, saying, "At least my enemy and I shall perish 
<A NAME="148"></A>together."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="149"></A><B>The Dog and the Hare</B>

<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR>A Hound having started a Hare on the hillside pursued her for some 
<A NAME="151"></A>distance, at one time biting her with his teeth as if he would take her 
<A NAME="152"></A>life, and at another fawning upon her, as if in play with another dog. 
<A NAME="153"></A> The Hare said to him, "I wish you would act sincerely by me, and show 
<A NAME="154"></A>yourself in your true colors.  If you are a friend, why do you bite me 
<A NAME="155"></A>so hard? If an enemy, why do you fawn on me?'
<A NAME="156"></A><BR><BR>No one can be a friend if you know not whether to trust or distrust 
<A NAME="157"></A>him.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="158"></A><B>The Bull and the Calf</B>

<A NAME="159"></A><BR><BR>A Bull was striving with all his might to squeeze himself through 
<A NAME="160"></A>a narrow passage which led to his stall.  A young Calf came up, and offered 
<A NAME="161"></A>to go before and show him the way by which he could manage to pass.  "Save 
<A NAME="162"></A>yourself the trouble," said the Bull; "I knew that way long before you 
<A NAME="163"></A>were born."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="164"></A><B>The Stag, the Wolf, and the Sheep</B>

<A NAME="165"></A><BR><BR>A Stag asked a Sheep to lend him a measure of wheat, and said that 
<A NAME="166"></A>the Wolf would be his surety.  The Sheep, fearing some fraud was intended, 
<A NAME="167"></A>excused herself, saying, "The Wolf is accustomed to seize what he wants 
<A NAME="168"></A>and to run off; and you, too, can quickly outstrip me in your rapid flight. 
<A NAME="169"></A> How then shall I be able to find you, when the day of payment 
<A NAME="170"></A>comes?'
<A NAME="171"></A><BR><BR>Two blacks do not make one white.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="172"></A><B>The Peacock and the Crane</B>

<A NAME="173"></A><BR><BR>A Peacock spreading its gorgeous tail mocked a Crane that passed 
<A NAME="174"></A>by, ridiculing the ashen hue of its plumage and saying, "I am robed, like 
<A NAME="175"></A>a king, in gold and purple and all the colors of the rainbow; while you 
<A NAME="176"></A>have not a bit of color on your wings." "True," replied the Crane; "but 
<A NAME="177"></A>I soar to the heights of heaven and lift up my voice to the stars, while 
<A NAME="178"></A>you walk below, like a cock, among the birds of the 
<A NAME="179"></A>dunghill."
<A NAME="180"></A><BR><BR>Fine feathers don't make fine birds.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="181"></A><B>The Fox and the Hedgehog</B>

<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>A Fox swimming across a rapid river was carried by the force of 
<A NAME="183"></A>the current into a very deep ravine, where he lay for a long time very 
<A NAME="184"></A>much bruised, sick, and unable to move.  A swarm of hungry blood-sucking 
<A NAME="185"></A>flies settled upon him.  A Hedgehog, passing by, saw his anguish and inquired 
<A NAME="186"></A>if he should drive away the flies that were tormenting him.  "By no means," 
<A NAME="187"></A>replied the Fox; "pray do not molest them."  "How is this?'  said the Hedgehog; 
<A NAME="188"></A>"do you not want to be rid of them?'  "No," returned the Fox, "for these 
<A NAME="189"></A>flies which you see are full of blood, and sting me but little, and if 
<A NAME="190"></A>you rid me of these which are already satiated, others more hungry will 
<A NAME="191"></A>come in their place, and will drink up all the blood I have 
<A NAME="192"></A>left."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="193"></A><B>The Eagle, the Cat, and the Wild Sow</B>

<A NAME="194"></A><BR><BR>An Eagle made her nest at the top of a lofty oak; a Cat, having 
<A NAME="195"></A>found a convenient hole, moved into the middle of the trunk; and a Wild 
<A NAME="196"></A>Sow, with her young, took shelter in a hollow at its foot. The Cat cunningly 
<A NAME="197"></A>resolved to destroy this chance-made colony. To carry out her design, she 
<A NAME="198"></A>climbed to the nest of the Eagle, and said, "Destruction is preparing for 
<A NAME="199"></A>you, and for me too, unfortunately.  The Wild Sow, whom you see daily digging 
<A NAME="200"></A>up the earth, wishes to uproot the oak, so she may on its fall seize our 
<A NAME="201"></A>families as food for her young."  Having thus frightened the Eagle out 
<A NAME="202"></A>of her senses, she crept down to the cave of the Sow, and said, "Your children 
<A NAME="203"></A>are in great danger; for as soon as you go out with your litter to find 
<A NAME="204"></A>food, the Eagle is prepared to pounce upon one of your little pigs."  Having 
<A NAME="205"></A>instilled these fears into the Sow, she went and pretended to hide herself 
<A NAME="206"></A>in the hollow of the tree.  When night came she went forth with silent 
<A NAME="207"></A>foot and obtained food for herself and her kittens, but feigning to be 
<A NAME="208"></A>afraid, she kept a lookout all through the day.  Meanwhile, the Eagle, 
<A NAME="209"></A>full of fear of the Sow, sat still on the branches, and the Sow, terrified 
<A NAME="210"></A>by the Eagle, did not dare to go out from her cave.  And thus they both, 
<A NAME="211"></A>along with their families, perished from hunger, and afforded ample provision 
<A NAME="212"></A>for the Cat and her kittens.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="213"></A><B>The Thief and the Innkeeper</B>

<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR>A Thief hired a room in a tavern and stayed a while in the hope 
<A NAME="215"></A>of stealing something which should enable him to pay his reckoning.  When 
<A NAME="216"></A>he had waited some days in vain, he saw the Innkeeper dressed in a new 
<A NAME="217"></A>and handsome coat and sitting before his door.  The Thief sat down beside 
<A NAME="218"></A>him and talked with him.  As the conversation began to flag, the Thief 
<A NAME="219"></A>yawned terribly and at the same time howled like a wolf.  The Innkeeper 
<A NAME="220"></A>said, "Why do you howl so fearfully?'  "I will tell you," said the Thief, 
<A NAME="221"></A>"but first let me ask you to hold my clothes, or I shall tear them to pieces. 
<A NAME="222"></A> I know not, sir, when I got this habit of yawning, nor whether these attacks 
<A NAME="223"></A>of howling were inflicted on me as a judgment for my crimes, or for any 
<A NAME="224"></A>other cause; but this I do know, that when I yawn for the third time, I 
<A NAME="225"></A>actually turn into a wolf and attack men."  With this speech he commenced 
<A NAME="226"></A>a second fit of yawning and again howled like a wolf, as he had at first. 
<A NAME="227"></A> The Innkeeper.  hearing his tale and believing what he said, became greatly 
<A NAME="228"></A>alarmed and, rising from his seat, attempted to run away. The Thief laid 
<A NAME="229"></A>hold of his coat and entreated him to stop, saying, "Pray wait, sir, and 
<A NAME="230"></A>hold my clothes, or I shall tear them to pieces in my fury, when I turn 
<A NAME="231"></A>into a wolf."  At the same moment he yawned the third time and set up a 
<A NAME="232"></A>terrible howl.  The Innkeeper, frightened lest he should be attacked, left 
<A NAME="233"></A>his new coat in the Thief's hand and ran as fast as he could into the inn 
<A NAME="234"></A>for safety.  The Thief made off with the coat and did not return again 
<A NAME="235"></A>to the inn.
<A NAME="236"></A><BR><BR>Every tale is not to be believed.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="237"></A><B>The Mule</B>

<A NAME="238"></A><BR><BR>A Mule, frolicsome from lack of work and from too much corn, galloped 
<A NAME="239"></A>about in a very extravagant manner, and said to himself: "My father surely 
<A NAME="240"></A>was a high-mettled racer, and I am his own child in speed and spirit." 
<A NAME="241"></A> On the next day, being driven a long journey, and feeling very wearied, 
<A NAME="242"></A>he exclaimed in a disconsolate tone:  "I must have made a mistake; my father, 
<A NAME="243"></A>after all, could have been only an ass."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="244"></A><B>The Hart and the Vine</B>

<A NAME="245"></A><BR><BR>A Hart, hard pressed in the chase, hid himself beneath the large 
<A NAME="246"></A>leaves of a Vine.  The huntsmen, in their haste, overshot the place of 
<A NAME="247"></A>his concealment.  Supposing all danger to have passed, the Hart began to 
<A NAME="248"></A>nibble the tendrils of the Vine.  One of the huntsmen, attracted by the 
<A NAME="249"></A>rustling of the leaves, looked back, and seeing the Hart, shot an arrow 
<A NAME="250"></A>from his bow and struck it. The Hart, at the point of death, groaned: 
<A NAME="251"></A> "I am rightly served, for I should not have maltreated the Vine that saved 
<A NAME="252"></A>me."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="253"></A><B>The Serpent and the Eagle</B>

<A NAME="254"></A><BR><BR>A Serpent and an Eagle were struggling with each other in deadly 
<A NAME="255"></A>conflict.  The Serpent had the advantage, and was about to strangle the 
<A NAME="256"></A>bird.  A countryman saw them, and running up, loosed the coil of the Serpent 
<A NAME="257"></A>and let the Eagle go free.  The Serpent, irritated at the escape of his 
<A NAME="258"></A>prey, injected his poison into the drinking horn of the countryman.  The 
<A NAME="259"></A>rustic, ignorant of his danger, was about to drink, when the Eagle struck 
<A NAME="260"></A>his hand with his wing, and, seizing the drinking horn in his talons, carried 
<A NAME="261"></A>it aloft.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="262"></A><B>The Crow and the Pitcher</B>

<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR>A Crow perishing with thirst saw a pitcher, and hoping to find 
<A NAME="264"></A>water, flew to it with delight.  When he reached it, he discovered to his 
<A NAME="265"></A>grief that it contained so little water that he could not possibly get 
<A NAME="266"></A>at it.  He tried everything he could think of to reach the water, but all 
<A NAME="267"></A>his efforts were in vain.  At last he collected as many stones as he could 
<A NAME="268"></A>carry and dropped them one by one with his beak into the pitcher, until 
<A NAME="269"></A>he brought the water within his reach and thus saved his 
<A NAME="270"></A>life.
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>Necessity is the mother of invention.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="272"></A><B>The Two Frogs</B>

<A NAME="273"></A><BR><BR>Two Frogs were neighbors.  One inhabited a deep pond, far removed 
<A NAME="274"></A>from public view; the other lived in a gully containing little water, and 
<A NAME="275"></A>traversed by a country road.  The Frog that lived in the pond warned his 
<A NAME="276"></A>friend to change his residence and entreated him to come and live with 
<A NAME="277"></A>him, saying that he would enjoy greater safety from danger and more abundant 
<A NAME="278"></A>food.  The other refused, saying that he felt it so very hard to leave 
<A NAME="279"></A>a place to which he had become accustomed.  A few days afterwards a heavy 
<A NAME="280"></A>wagon passed through the gully and crushed him to death under its 
<A NAME="281"></A>wheels.
<A NAME="282"></A><BR><BR>A willful man will have his way to his own hurt.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="283"></A><B>The Wolf and the Fox</B>

<A NAME="284"></A><BR><BR>At one time a very large and strong Wolf was born among the wolves, 
<A NAME="285"></A>who exceeded all his fellow-wolves in strength, size, and swiftness, so 
<A NAME="286"></A>that they unanimously decided to call him "Lion." The Wolf, with a lack 
<A NAME="287"></A>of sense proportioned to his enormous size, thought that they gave him 
<A NAME="288"></A>this name in earnest, and, leaving his own race, consorted exclusively 
<A NAME="289"></A>with the lions.  An old sly Fox, seeing this, said, "May I never make myself 
<A NAME="290"></A>so ridiculous as you do in your pride and self-conceit; for even though 
<A NAME="291"></A>you have the size of a lion among wolves, in a herd of lions you are definitely 
<A NAME="292"></A>a wolf."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="293"></A><B>The Walnut-Tree</B>

<A NAME="294"></A><BR><BR>A Walnut-Tree standing by the roadside bore an abundant crop of 
<A NAME="295"></A>fruit.  For the sake of the nuts, the passers-by broke its branches with 
<A NAME="296"></A>stones and sticks.  The Walnut-Tree piteously exclaimed, "O wretched me! 
<A NAME="297"></A>that those whom I cheer with my fruit should repay me with these painful 
<A NAME="298"></A>requitals!"
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="299"></A><B>The Gnat and the Lion</B>

<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR>A Gnat came and said to a Lion, "I do not in the least fear you, 
<A NAME="301"></A>nor are you stronger than I am.  For in what does your strength consist? 
<A NAME="302"></A>You can scratch with your claws and bite with your teeth an a woman in 
<A NAME="303"></A>her quarrels.  I repeat that I am altogether more powerful than you; and 
<A NAME="304"></A>if you doubt it, let us fight and see who will conquer."  The Gnat, having 
<A NAME="305"></A>sounded his horn, fastened himself upon the Lion and stung him on the nostrils 
<A NAME="306"></A>and the parts of the face devoid of hair.  While trying to crush him, the 
<A NAME="307"></A>Lion tore himself with his claws, until he punished himself severely. The 
<A NAME="308"></A>Gnat thus prevailed over the Lion, and, buzzing about in a song of triumph, 
<A NAME="309"></A>flew away.  But shortly afterwards he became entangled in the meshes of 
<A NAME="310"></A>a cobweb and was eaten by a spider. He greatly lamented his fate, saying, 
<A NAME="311"></A>"Woe is me! that I, who can wage war successfully with the hugest beasts, 
<A NAME="312"></A>should perish myself from this spider, the most inconsiderable of 
<A NAME="313"></A>insects!"
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="314"></A><B>The Monkey and the Dolphin</B>

<A NAME="315"></A><BR><BR>A Sailor, bound on a long voyage, took with him a Monkey to amuse 
<A NAME="316"></A>him while on shipboard.  As he sailed off the coast of Greece, a violent 
<A NAME="317"></A>tempest arose in which the ship was wrecked and he, his Monkey, and all 
<A NAME="318"></A>the crew were obliged to swim for their lives.  A Dolphin saw the Monkey 
<A NAME="319"></A>contending with the waves, and supposing him to be a man (whom he is always 
<A NAME="320"></A>said to befriend), came and placed himself under him, to convey him on 
<A NAME="321"></A>his back in safety to the shore.  When the Dolphin arrived with his burden 
<A NAME="322"></A>in sight of land not far from Athens, he asked the Monkey if he were an 
<A NAME="323"></A>Athenian.  The latter replied that he was, and that he was descended from 
<A NAME="324"></A>one of the most noble families in that city.  The Dolphin then inquired 
<A NAME="325"></A>if he knew the Piraeus (the famous harbor of Athens).  Supposing that a 
<A NAME="326"></A>man was meant, the Monkey answered that he knew him very well and that 
<A NAME="327"></A>he was an intimate friend. The Dolphin, indignant at these falsehoods, 
<A NAME="328"></A>dipped the Monkey under the water and drowned him.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="329"></A><B>The Jackdaw and the Doves</B>

<A NAME="330"></A><BR><BR>A Jackdaw, seeing some Doves in a cote abundantly provided with 
<A NAME="331"></A>food, painted himself white and joined them in order to share their plentiful 
<A NAME="332"></A>maintenance.  The Doves, as long as he was silent, supposed him to be one 
<A NAME="333"></A>of themselves and admitted him to their cote.  But when one day he forgot 
<A NAME="334"></A>himself and began to chatter, they discovered his true character and drove 
<A NAME="335"></A>him forth, pecking him with their beaks.  Failing to obtain food among 
<A NAME="336"></A>the Doves, he returned to the Jackdaws.  They too, not recognizing him 
<A NAME="337"></A>on account of his color.  expelled him from living with them. So desiring 
<A NAME="338"></A>two ends, he obtained neither.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="339"></A><B>The Horse and the Stag</B>

<A NAME="340"></A><BR><BR>At one time the Horse had the plain entirely to himself.  Then 
<A NAME="341"></A>a Stag intruded into his domain and shared his pasture.  The Horse, desiring 
<A NAME="342"></A>to revenge himself on the stranger, asked a man if he were willing to help 
<A NAME="343"></A>him in punishing the Stag.  The man replied that if the Horse would receive 
<A NAME="344"></A>a bit in his mouth and agree to carry him, he would contrive effective 
<A NAME="345"></A>weapons against the Stag. The Horse consented and allowed the man to mount 
<A NAME="346"></A>him.  From that hour he found that instead of obtaining revenge on the 
<A NAME="347"></A>Stag, he had enslaved himself to the service of man.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="348"></A><B>The Kid and the Wolf</B>

<A NAME="349"></A><BR><BR>A Kid, returning without protection from the pasture, was pursued 
<A NAME="350"></A>by a Wolf.  Seeing he could not escape, he turned round, and said:  "I 
<A NAME="351"></A>know, friend Wolf, that I must be your prey, but before I die I would ask 
<A NAME="352"></A>of you one favor you will play me a tune to which I may dance."  The Wolf 
<A NAME="353"></A>complied, and while he was piping and the Kid was dancing, some hounds 
<A NAME="354"></A>hearing the sound ran up and began chasing the Wolf.  Turning to the Kid, 
<A NAME="355"></A>he said, "It is just what I deserve; for I, who am only a butcher, should 
<A NAME="356"></A>not have turned piper to please you."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="357"></A><B>The Prophet</B>

<A NAME="358"></A><BR><BR>A Wizard, sitting in the marketplace, was telling the fortunes 
<A NAME="359"></A>of the passers-by when a person ran up in great haste, and announced to 
<A NAME="360"></A>him that the doors of his house had been broken open and that all his goods 
<A NAME="361"></A>were being stolen.  He sighed heavily and hastened away as fast as he could 
<A NAME="362"></A>run.  A neighbor saw him running and said, "Oh! you fellow there! you say 
<A NAME="363"></A>you can foretell the fortunes of others; how is it you did not foresee 
<A NAME="364"></A>your own?'
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="365"></A><B>The Fox and the Monkey</B>

<A NAME="366"></A><BR><BR>A Fox and a Monkey were traveling together on the same road.  As 
<A NAME="367"></A>they journeyed, they passed through a cemetery full of monuments. "All 
<A NAME="368"></A>these monuments which you see," said the Monkey, "are erected in honor 
<A NAME="369"></A>of my ancestors, who were in their day freedmen and citizens of great renown." 
<A NAME="370"></A> The Fox replied, "You have chosen a most appropriate subject for your 
<A NAME="371"></A>falsehoods, as I am sure none of your ancestors will be able to contradict 
<A NAME="372"></A>you."
<A NAME="373"></A><BR><BR>A false tale often betrays itself.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="374"></A><B>The Thief and the Housedog</B>

<A NAME="375"></A><BR><BR>A Thief came in the night to break into a house.  He brought with 
<A NAME="376"></A>him several slices of meat in order to pacify the Housedog, so that he 
<A NAME="377"></A>would not alarm his master by barking.  As the Thief threw him the pieces 
<A NAME="378"></A>of meat, the Dog said, "If you think to stop my mouth, you will be greatly 
<A NAME="379"></A>mistaken.  This sudden kindness at your hands will only make me more watchful, 
<A NAME="380"></A>lest under these unexpected favors to myself, you have some private ends 
<A NAME="381"></A>to accomplish for your own benefit, and for my master's 
<A NAME="382"></A>injury."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="383"></A><B>The Man, the Horse, the Ox, and the Dog</B>

<A NAME="384"></A><BR><BR>A Horse, Ox, and Dog, driven to great straits by the cold, sought 
<A NAME="385"></A>shelter and protection from Man.  He received them kindly, lighted a fire, 
<A NAME="386"></A>and warmed them.  He let the Horse make free with his oats, gave the Ox 
<A NAME="387"></A>an abundance of hay, and fed the Dog with meat from his own table.  Grateful 
<A NAME="388"></A>for these favors, the animals determined to repay him to the best of their 
<A NAME="389"></A>ability.  For this purpose, they divided the term of his life between them, 
<A NAME="390"></A>and each endowed one portion of it with the qualities which chiefly characterized 
<A NAME="391"></A>himself.  The Horse chose his earliest years and gave them his own attributes: 
<A NAME="392"></A> hence every man is in his youth impetuous, headstrong, and obstinate in 
<A NAME="393"></A>maintaining his own opinion.  The Ox took under his patronage the next 
<A NAME="394"></A>term of life, and therefore man in his middle age is fond of work, devoted 
<A NAME="395"></A>to labor, and resolute to amass wealth and to husband his resources. The 
<A NAME="396"></A>end of life was reserved for the Dog, wherefore the old man is often snappish, 
<A NAME="397"></A>irritable, hard to please, and selfish, tolerant only of his own household, 
<A NAME="398"></A>but averse to strangers and to all who do not administer to his comfort 
<A NAME="399"></A>or to his necessities.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="400"></A><B>The Apes and the Two Travelers</B>

<A NAME="401"></A><BR><BR>Two men, one who always spoke the truth and the other who told 
<A NAME="402"></A>nothing but lies, were traveling together and by chance came to the land 
<A NAME="403"></A>of Apes.  One of the Apes, who had raised himself to be king, commanded 
<A NAME="404"></A>them to be seized and brought before him, that he might know what was said 
<A NAME="405"></A>of him among men.  He ordered at the same time that all the Apes be arranged 
<A NAME="406"></A>in a long row on his right hand and on his left, and that a throne be placed 
<A NAME="407"></A>for him, as was the custom among men.  After these preparations he signified 
<A NAME="408"></A>that the two men should be brought before him, and greeted them with this 
<A NAME="409"></A>salutation:  "What sort of a king do I seem to you to be, O strangers?' 
<A NAME="410"></A> The Lying Traveler replied, "You seem to me a most mighty king."  "And 
<A NAME="411"></A>what is your estimate of those you see around me?'  "These," he made answer, 
<A NAME="412"></A>"are worthy companions of yourself, fit at least to be ambassadors and 
<A NAME="413"></A>leaders of armies."  The Ape and all his court, gratified with the lie, 
<A NAME="414"></A>commanded that a handsome present be given to the flatterer. On this the 
<A NAME="415"></A>truthful Traveler thought to himself, "If so great a reward be given for 
<A NAME="416"></A>a lie, with what gift may not I be rewarded, if, according to my custom, 
<A NAME="417"></A>I tell the truth?'  The Ape quickly turned to him.  "And pray how do I 
<A NAME="418"></A>and these my friends around me seem to you?'  "Thou art," he said, "a most 
<A NAME="419"></A>excellent Ape, and all these thy companions after thy example are excellent 
<A NAME="420"></A>Apes too." The King of the Apes, enraged at hearing these truths, gave 
<A NAME="421"></A>him over to the teeth and claws of his companions.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="422"></A><B>The Wolf and the Shepherd</B>

<A NAME="423"></A><BR><BR>A Wolf followed a flock of sheep for a long time and did not attempt 
<A NAME="424"></A>to injure one of them.  The Shepherd at first stood on his guard against 
<A NAME="425"></A>him, as against an enemy, and kept a strict watch over his movements. 
<A NAME="426"></A> But when the Wolf, day after day, kept in the company of the sheep and 
<A NAME="427"></A>did not make the slightest effort to seize them, the Shepherd began to 
<A NAME="428"></A>look upon him as a guardian of his flock rather than as a plotter of evil 
<A NAME="429"></A>against it; and when occasion called him one day into the city, he left 
<A NAME="430"></A>the sheep entirely in his charge.  The Wolf, now that he had the opportunity, 
<A NAME="431"></A>fell upon the sheep, and destroyed the greater part of the flock.  When 
<A NAME="432"></A>the Shepherd returned to find his flock destroyed, he exclaimed:  "I have 
<A NAME="433"></A>been rightly served; why did I trust my sheep to a Wolf?'
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="434"></A><B>The Hares and the Lions</B>

<A NAME="435"></A><BR><BR>The Hares harangued the assembly, and argued that all should be 
<A NAME="436"></A>equal.  The Lions made this reply:  "Your words, O Hares! are good; but 
<A NAME="437"></A>they lack both claws and teeth such as we have."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="438"></A><B>The Lark and Her Young Ones</B>

<A NAME="439"></A><BR><BR>A Lark had made her nest in the early spring on the young green 
<A NAME="440"></A>wheat.  The brood had almost grown to their full strength and attained 
<A NAME="441"></A>the use of their wings and the full plumage of their feathers, when the 
<A NAME="442"></A>owner of the field, looking over his ripe crop, said, "The time has come 
<A NAME="443"></A>when I must ask all my neighbors to help me with my harvest."  One of the 
<A NAME="444"></A>young Larks heard his speech and related it to his mother, inquiring of 
<A NAME="445"></A>her to what place they should move for safety.  "There is no occasion to 
<A NAME="446"></A>move yet, my son," she replied; "the man who only sends to his friends 
<A NAME="447"></A>to help him with his harvest is not really in earnest."  The owner of the 
<A NAME="448"></A>field came again a few days later and saw the wheat shedding the grain 
<A NAME="449"></A>from excess of ripeness.  He said, "I will come myself tomorrow with my 
<A NAME="450"></A>laborers, and with as many reapers as I can hire, and will get in the harvest." 
<A NAME="451"></A> The Lark on hearing these words said to her brood, "It is time now to 
<A NAME="452"></A>be off, my little ones, for the man is in earnest this time; he no longer 
<A NAME="453"></A>trusts his friends, but will reap the field himself."
<A NAME="454"></A><BR><BR>Self-help is the best help.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="455"></A><B>The Fox and the Lion</B>

<A NAME="456"></A><BR><BR>When a Fox who had never yet seen a Lion, fell in with him by chance 
<A NAME="457"></A>for the first time in the forest, he was so frightened that he nearly died 
<A NAME="458"></A>with fear.  On meeting him for the second time, he was still much alarmed, 
<A NAME="459"></A>but not to the same extent as at first.  On seeing him the third time, 
<A NAME="460"></A>he so increased in boldness that he went up to him and commenced a familiar 
<A NAME="461"></A>conversation with him.
<A NAME="462"></A><BR><BR>Acquaintance softens prejudices.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="463"></A><B>The Weasel and the Mice</B>

<A NAME="464"></A><BR><BR>A Weasel, inactive from age and infirmities, was not able to catch 
<A NAME="465"></A>mice as he once did.  He therefore rolled himself in flour and lay down 
<A NAME="466"></A>in a dark corner.  A Mouse, supposing him to be food, leaped upon him, 
<A NAME="467"></A>and was instantly caught and squeezed to death.  Another perished in a 
<A NAME="468"></A>similar manner, and then a third, and still others after them.  A very 
<A NAME="469"></A>old Mouse, who had escaped many a trap and snare, observed from a safe 
<A NAME="470"></A>distance the trick of his crafty foe and said, "Ah! you that lie there, 
<A NAME="471"></A>may you prosper just in the same proportion as you are what you pretend 
<A NAME="472"></A>to be!"
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="473"></A><B>The Boy Bathing</B>

<A NAME="474"></A><BR><BR>A boy bathing in a river was in danger of being drowned.  He called 
<A NAME="475"></A>out to a passing traveler for help, but instead of holding out a helping 
<A NAME="476"></A>hand, the man stood by unconcernedly, and scolded the boy for his imprudence. 
<A NAME="477"></A> "Oh, sir!"  cried the youth, "pray help me now and scold me 
<A NAME="478"></A>afterwards."
<A NAME="479"></A><BR><BR>Counsel without help is useless.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="480"></A><B>The Ass and the Wolf</B>

<A NAME="481"></A><BR><BR>An Ass feeding in a meadow saw a Wolf approaching to seize him, 
<A NAME="482"></A>and immediately pretended to be lame.  The Wolf, coming up, inquired the 
<A NAME="483"></A>cause of his lameness.  The Ass replied that passing through a hedge he 
<A NAME="484"></A>had trod with his foot upon a sharp thorn.  He requested that the Wolf 
<A NAME="485"></A>pull it out, lest when he ate him it should injure his throat.  The Wolf 
<A NAME="486"></A>consented and lifted up the foot, and was giving his whole mind to the 
<A NAME="487"></A>discovery of the thorn, when the Ass, with his heels, kicked his teeth 
<A NAME="488"></A>into his mouth and galloped away.  The Wolf, being thus fearfully mauled, 
<A NAME="489"></A>said, "I am rightly served, for why did I attempt the art of healing, when 
<A NAME="490"></A>my father only taught me the trade of a butcher?'
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="491"></A><B>The Seller of Images</B>

<A NAME="492"></A><BR><BR>A certain man made a wooden image of Mercury and offered it for 
<A NAME="493"></A>sale.  When no one appeared willing to buy it, in order to attract purchasers, 
<A NAME="494"></A>he cried out that he had the statue to sell of a benefactor who bestowed 
<A NAME="495"></A>wealth and helped to heap up riches. One of the bystanders said to him, 
<A NAME="496"></A>"My good fellow, why do you sell him, being such a one as you describe, 
<A NAME="497"></A>when you may yourself enjoy the good things he has to give?'  "Why," he 
<A NAME="498"></A>replied, "I am in need of immediate help, and he is wont to give his good 
<A NAME="499"></A>gifts very slowly."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="500"></A><B>The Fox and the Grapes</B>

<A NAME="501"></A><BR><BR>A famished Fox saw some clusters of ripe black grapes hanging from 
<A NAME="502"></A>a trellised vine.  She resorted to all her tricks to get at them, but wearied 
<A NAME="503"></A>herself in vain, for she could not reach them. At last she turned away, 
<A NAME="504"></A>hiding her disappointment and saying: "The Grapes are sour, and not ripe 
<A NAME="505"></A>as I thought."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="506"></A><B>The Man and His Wife</B>

<A NAME="507"></A><BR><BR>A Man had a Wife who made herself hated by all the members of his 
<A NAME="508"></A>household.  Wishing to find out if she had the same effect on the persons 
<A NAME="509"></A>in her father's house, he made some excuse to send her home on a visit 
<A NAME="510"></A>to her father.  After a short time she returned, and when he inquired how 
<A NAME="511"></A>she had got on and how the servants had treated her, she replied, "The 
<A NAME="512"></A>herdsmen and shepherds cast on me looks of aversion."  He said, "O Wife, 
<A NAME="513"></A>if you were disliked by those who go out early in the morning with their 
<A NAME="514"></A>flocks and return late in the evening, what must have been felt towards 
<A NAME="515"></A>you by those with whom you passed the whole day!"
<A NAME="516"></A><BR><BR>Straws show how the wind blows.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="517"></A><B>The Peacock and Juno</B>

<A NAME="518"></A><BR><BR>The Peacock made complaint to Juno that, while the nightingale 
<A NAME="519"></A>pleased every ear with his song, he himself no sooner opened his mouth 
<A NAME="520"></A>than he became a laughingstock to all who heard him.  The Goddess, to console 
<A NAME="521"></A>him, said, "But you far excel in beauty and in size.  The splendor of the 
<A NAME="522"></A>emerald shines in your neck and you unfold a tail gorgeous with painted 
<A NAME="523"></A>plumage."  "But for what purpose have I," said the bird, "this dumb beauty 
<A NAME="524"></A>so long as I am surpassed in song?'   "The lot of each," replied Juno, 
<A NAME="525"></A>"has been assigned by the will of the Fates--to thee, beauty; to the eagle, 
<A NAME="526"></A>strength; to the nightingale, song; to the raven, favorable, and to the 
<A NAME="527"></A>crow, unfavorable auguries.  These are all contented with the endowments 
<A NAME="528"></A>allotted to them."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="529"></A><B>The Hawk and the Nightingale</B>

<A NAME="530"></A><BR><BR>A Nightingale, sitting aloft upon an oak and singing according 
<A NAME="531"></A>to his wont, was seen by a Hawk who, being in need of food, swooped down 
<A NAME="532"></A>and seized him.  The Nightingale, about to lose his life, earnestly begged 
<A NAME="533"></A>the Hawk to let him go, saying that he was not big enough to satisfy the 
<A NAME="534"></A>hunger of a Hawk who, if he wanted food, ought to pursue the larger birds. 
<A NAME="535"></A> The Hawk, interrupting him, said:  "I should indeed have lost my senses 
<A NAME="536"></A>if I should let go food ready in my hand, for the sake of pursuing birds 
<A NAME="537"></A>which are not yet even within sight."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="538"></A><B>The Dog, the Cock, and the Fox</B>

<A NAME="539"></A><BR><BR>A Dog and a Cock being great friends, agreed to travel together. 
<A NAME="540"></A>At nightfall they took shelter in a thick wood.  The Cock flying up, perched 
<A NAME="541"></A>himself on the branches of a tree, while the Dog found a bed beneath in 
<A NAME="542"></A>the hollow trunk.  When the morning dawned, the Cock, as usual, crowed 
<A NAME="543"></A>very loudly several times.  A Fox heard the sound, and wishing to make 
<A NAME="544"></A>a breakfast on him, came and stood under the branches, saying how earnestly 
<A NAME="545"></A>he desired to make the acquaintance of the owner of so magnificent a voice. 
<A NAME="546"></A>The Cock, suspecting his civilities, said:  "Sir, I wish you would do me 
<A NAME="547"></A>the favor of going around to the hollow trunk below me, and waking my porter, 
<A NAME="548"></A>so that he may open the door and let you in." When the Fox approached the 
<A NAME="549"></A>tree, the Dog sprang out and caught him, and tore him to 
<A NAME="550"></A>pieces.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="551"></A><B>The Wolf and the Goat</B>

<A NAME="552"></A><BR><BR>A Wolf saw a Goat feeding at the summit of a steep precipice, where 
<A NAME="553"></A>he had no chance of reaching her.  He called to her and earnestly begged 
<A NAME="554"></A>her to come lower down, lest she fall by some mishap; and he added that 
<A NAME="555"></A>the meadows lay where he was standing, and that the herbage was most tender. 
<A NAME="556"></A> She replied, "No, my friend, it is not for the pasture that you invite 
<A NAME="557"></A>me, but for yourself, who are in want of food."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="558"></A><B>The Lion and the Bull</B>

<A NAME="559"></A><BR><BR>A Lion, greatly desiring to capture a Bull, and yet afraid to attack 
<A NAME="560"></A>him on account of his great size, resorted to a trick to ensure his destruction. 
<A NAME="561"></A> He approached the Bull and said, "I have slain a fine sheep, my friend; 
<A NAME="562"></A>and if you will come home and partake of him with me, I shall be delighted 
<A NAME="563"></A>to have your company."  The Lion said this in the hope that, as the Bull 
<A NAME="564"></A>was in the act of reclining to eat, he might attack him to advantage, and 
<A NAME="565"></A>make his meal on him.  The Bull, on approaching the Lion's den, saw the 
<A NAME="566"></A>huge spits and giant caldrons, and no sign whatever of the sheep, and, 
<A NAME="567"></A>without saying a word, quietly took his departure.  The Lion inquired why 
<A NAME="568"></A>he went off so abruptly without a word of salutation to his host, who had 
<A NAME="569"></A>not given him any cause for offense.  "I have reasons enough," said the 
<A NAME="570"></A>Bull.  "I see no indication whatever of your having slaughtered a sheep, 
<A NAME="571"></A>while I do see very plainly every preparation for your dining on a 
<A NAME="572"></A>bull."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="573"></A><B>The Goat and the Ass</B>

<A NAME="574"></A><BR><BR>A man once kept a Goat and an Ass.  The Goat, envying the Ass on 
<A NAME="575"></A>account of his greater abundance of food, said, "How shamefully you are 
<A NAME="576"></A>treated:  at one time grinding in the mill, and at another carrying heavy 
<A NAME="577"></A>burdens"; and he further advised him to pretend to be epileptic and fall 
<A NAME="578"></A>into a ditch and so obtain rest.  The Ass listened to his words, and falling 
<A NAME="579"></A>into a ditch, was very much bruised.  His master, sending for a leech, 
<A NAME="580"></A>asked his advice.  He bade him pour upon the wounds the lungs of a Goat. 
<A NAME="581"></A> They at once killed the Goat, and so healed the Ass.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="582"></A><B>The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse</B>

<A NAME="583"></A><BR><BR>A Country Mouse invited a Town Mouse, an intimate friend, to pay 
<A NAME="584"></A>him a visit and partake of his country fare.  As they were on the bare 
<A NAME="585"></A>plowlands, eating there wheat-stocks and roots pulled up from the hedgerow, 
<A NAME="586"></A>the Town Mouse said to his friend, "You live here the life of the ants, 
<A NAME="587"></A>while in my house is the horn of plenty.  I am surrounded by every luxury, 
<A NAME="588"></A>and if you will come with me, as I wish you would, you shall have an ample 
<A NAME="589"></A>share of my dainties."  The Country Mouse was easily persuaded, and returned 
<A NAME="590"></A>to town with his friend.  On his arrival, the Town Mouse placed before 
<A NAME="591"></A>him bread, barley, beans, dried figs, honey, raisins, and, last of all, 
<A NAME="592"></A>brought a dainty piece of cheese from a basket.  The Country Mouse, being 
<A NAME="593"></A>much delighted at the sight of such good cheer, expressed his satisfaction 
<A NAME="594"></A>in warm terms and lamented his own hard fate.  Just as they were beginning 
<A NAME="595"></A>to eat, someone opened the door, and they both ran off squeaking, as fast 
<A NAME="596"></A>as they could, to a hole so narrow that two could only find room in it 
<A NAME="597"></A>by squeezing.  They had scarcely begun their repast again when someone 
<A NAME="598"></A>else entered to take something out of a cupboard, whereupon the two Mice, 
<A NAME="599"></A>more frightened than before, ran away and hid themselves.  At last the 
<A NAME="600"></A>Country Mouse, almost famished, said to his friend:  "Although you have 
<A NAME="601"></A>prepared for me so dainty a feast, I must leave you to enjoy it by yourself. 
<A NAME="602"></A> It is surrounded by too many dangers to please me.  I prefer my bare plowlands 
<A NAME="603"></A>and roots from the hedgerow, where I can live in safety, and without 
<A NAME="604"></A>fear."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="605"></A><B>The Wolf, the Fox, and the Ape</B>

<A NAME="606"></A><BR><BR>A Wolf accused a Fox of theft, but the Fox entirely denied the 
<A NAME="607"></A>charge.  An Ape undertook to adjudge the matter between them. When each 
<A NAME="608"></A>had fully stated his case the Ape announced this sentence:  "I do not think 
<A NAME="609"></A>you, Wolf, ever lost what you claim; and I do believe you, Fox, to have 
<A NAME="610"></A>stolen what you so stoutly deny."
<A NAME="611"></A><BR><BR>The dishonest, if they act honestly, get no 
<A NAME="612"></A>credit.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="613"></A><B>The Fly and the Draught-Mule</B>

<A NAME="614"></A><BR><BR>A Fly sat on the axle-tree of a chariot, and addressing the Draught-Mule 
<A NAME="615"></A>said, "How slow you are! Why do you not go faster? See if I do not prick 
<A NAME="616"></A>your neck with my sting."  The Draught-Mule replied, "I do not heed your 
<A NAME="617"></A>threats; I only care for him who sits above you, and who quickens my pace 
<A NAME="618"></A>with his whip, or holds me back with the reins.  Away, therefore, with 
<A NAME="619"></A>your insolence, for I know well when to go fast, and when to go 
<A NAME="620"></A>slow."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="621"></A><B>The Fishermen</B>

<A NAME="622"></A><BR><BR>Some Fishermen were out trawling their nets.  Perceiving them to 
<A NAME="623"></A>be very heavy, they danced about for joy and supposed that they had taken 
<A NAME="624"></A>a large catch.  When they had dragged the nets to the shore they found 
<A NAME="625"></A>but few fish:  the nets were full of sand and stones, and the men were 
<A NAME="626"></A>beyond measure cast downso much at the disappointment which had befallen 
<A NAME="627"></A>them, but because they had formed such very different expectations.  One 
<A NAME="628"></A>of their company, an old man, said, "Let us cease lamenting, my mates, 
<A NAME="629"></A>for, as it seems to me, sorrow is always the twin sister of joy; and it 
<A NAME="630"></A>was only to be looked for that we, who just now were over-rejoiced, should 
<A NAME="631"></A>next have something to make us sad."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="632"></A><B>The Lion and the Three Bulls</B>

<A NAME="633"></A><BR><BR>Three Bulls for a long time pastured together.  A Lion lay in ambush 
<A NAME="634"></A>in the hope of making them his prey, but was afraid to attack them while 
<A NAME="635"></A>they kept together.  Having at last by guileful speeches succeeded in separating 
<A NAME="636"></A>them, he attacked them without fear as they fed alone, and feasted on them 
<A NAME="637"></A>one by one at his own leisure.
<A NAME="638"></A><BR><BR>Union is strength.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="639"></A><B>The Fowler and the Viper</B>

<A NAME="640"></A><BR><BR>A Fowler, taking his bird-lime and his twigs, went out to catch 
<A NAME="641"></A>birds.  Seeing a thrush sitting upon a tree, he wished to take it, and 
<A NAME="642"></A>fitting his twigs to a proper length, watched intently, having his whole 
<A NAME="643"></A>thoughts directed towards the sky.  While thus looking upwards, he unknowingly 
<A NAME="644"></A>trod upon a Viper asleep just before his feet.  The Viper, turning about, 
<A NAME="645"></A>stung him, and falling into a swoon, the man said to himself, "Woe is me! 
<A NAME="646"></A>that while I purposed to hunt another, I am myself fallen unawares into 
<A NAME="647"></A>the snares of death."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="648"></A><B>The Horse and the Ass</B>

<A NAME="649"></A><BR><BR>A Horse, proud of his fine trappings, met an Ass on the highway. 
<A NAME="650"></A>The Ass, being heavily laden, moved slowly out of the way. "Hardly," said 
<A NAME="651"></A>the Horse, "can I resist kicking you with my heels."  The Ass held his 
<A NAME="652"></A>peace, and made only a silent appeal to the justice of the gods.  Not long 
<A NAME="653"></A>afterwards the Horse, having become broken-winded, was sent by his owner 
<A NAME="654"></A>to the farm.  The Ass, seeing him drawing a dungcart, thus derided him: 
<A NAME="655"></A> "Where, O boaster, are now all thy gay trappings, thou who are thyself 
<A NAME="656"></A>reduced to the condition you so lately treated with 
<A NAME="657"></A>contempt?'
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="658"></A><B>The Fox and the Mask</B>

<A NAME="659"></A><BR><BR>A Fox entered the house of an actor and, rummaging through all 
<A NAME="660"></A>his properties, came upon a Mask, an admirable imitation of a human head. 
<A NAME="661"></A> He placed his paws on it and said, "What a beautiful head! Yet it is of 
<A NAME="662"></A>no value, as it entirely lacks brains."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="663"></A><B>The Geese and the Cranes</B>

<A NAME="664"></A><BR><BR>The Geese and the Cranes were feeding in the same meadow, when 
<A NAME="665"></A>a birdcatcher came to ensnare them in his nets.  The Cranes, being light 
<A NAME="666"></A>of wing, fled away at his approach; while the Geese, being slower of flight 
<A NAME="667"></A>and heavier in their bodies, were captured.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="668"></A><B>The Blind Man and the Whelp</B>

<A NAME="669"></A><BR><BR>A Blind Man was accustomed to distinguishing different animals 
<A NAME="670"></A>by touching them with his hands.  The whelp of a Wolf was brought him, 
<A NAME="671"></A>with a request that he would feel it, and say what it was. He felt it, 
<A NAME="672"></A>and being in doubt, said:  "I do not quite know whether it is the cub of 
<A NAME="673"></A>a Fox, or the whelp of a Wolf, but this I know full well.  It would not 
<A NAME="674"></A>be safe to admit him to the sheepfold."
<A NAME="675"></A><BR><BR>Evil tendencies are shown in early life.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="676"></A><B>The Dogs and the Fox</B>

<A NAME="677"></A><BR><BR>Some Dogs, finding the skin of a lion, began to tear it in pieces 
<A NAME="678"></A>with their teeth.  A Fox, seeing them, said, "If this lion were alive, 
<A NAME="679"></A>you would soon find out that his claws were stronger than your 
<A NAME="680"></A>teeth."
<A NAME="681"></A><BR><BR>It is easy to kick a man that is down.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="682"></A><B>The Cobbler Turned Doctor</B>

<A NAME="683"></A><BR><BR>A Cobbler unable to make a living by his trade and made desperate 
<A NAME="684"></A>by poverty, began to practice medicine in a town in which he was not known. 
<A NAME="685"></A> He sold a drug, pretending that it was an antidote to all poisons, and 
<A NAME="686"></A>obtained a great name for himself by long-winded puffs and advertisements. 
<A NAME="687"></A> When the Cobbler happened to fall sick himself of a serious illness, the 
<A NAME="688"></A>Governor of the town determined to test his skill.  For this purpose he 
<A NAME="689"></A>called for a cup, and while filling it with water, pretended to mix poison 
<A NAME="690"></A>with the Cobbler's antidote, commanding him to drink it on the promise 
<A NAME="691"></A>of a reward.  The Cobbler, under the fear of death, confessed that he had 
<A NAME="692"></A>no knowledge of medicine, and was only made famous by the stupid clamors 
<A NAME="693"></A>of the crowd.  The Governor then called a public assembly and addressed 
<A NAME="694"></A>the citizens:  "Of what folly have you been guilty? You have not hesitated 
<A NAME="695"></A>to entrust your heads to a man, whom no one could employ to make even the 
<A NAME="696"></A>shoes for their feet."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="697"></A><B>The Wolf and the Horse</B>

<A NAME="698"></A><BR><BR>A Wolf coming out of a field of oats met a Horse and thus addressed 
<A NAME="699"></A>him:  "I would advise you to go into that field.  It is full of fine oats, 
<A NAME="700"></A>which I have left untouched for you, as you are a friend whom I would love 
<A NAME="701"></A>to hear enjoying good eating."  The Horse replied, "If oats had been the 
<A NAME="702"></A>food of wolves, you would never have indulged your ears at the cost of 
<A NAME="703"></A>your belly."
<A NAME="704"></A><BR><BR>Men of evil reputation, when they perform a good deed, fail to 
<A NAME="705"></A>get credit for it.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="706"></A><B>The Brother and the Sister</B>

<A NAME="707"></A><BR><BR>A father had one son and one daughter, the former remarkable for 
<A NAME="708"></A>his good looks, the latter for her extraordinary ugliness.  While they 
<A NAME="709"></A>were playing one day as children, they happened by chance to look together 
<A NAME="710"></A>into a mirror that was placed on their mother's chair.  The boy congratulated 
<A NAME="711"></A>himself on his good looks; the girl grew angry, and could not bear the 
<A NAME="712"></A>self-praises of her Brother, interpreting all he said (and how could she 
<A NAME="713"></A>do otherwise?) into reflection on herself.  She ran off to her father. 
<A NAME="714"></A> to be avenged on her Brother, and spitefully accused him of having, as 
<A NAME="715"></A>a boy, made use of that which belonged only to girls.  The father embraced 
<A NAME="716"></A>them both, and bestowing his kisses and affection impartially on each, 
<A NAME="717"></A>said, "I wish you both would look into the mirror every day:  you, my son, 
<A NAME="718"></A>that you may not spoil your beauty by evil conduct; and you, my daughter, 
<A NAME="719"></A>that you may make up for your lack of beauty by your 
<A NAME="720"></A>virtues."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="721"></A><B>The Wasps, the Partridges, and the Farmer</B>

<A NAME="722"></A><BR><BR>The Wasps and the Partridges, overcome with thirst, came to a Farmer 
<A NAME="723"></A>and besought him to give them some water to drink.  They promised amply 
<A NAME="724"></A>to repay him the favor which they asked.  The Partridges declared that 
<A NAME="725"></A>they would dig around his vines and make them produce finer grapes.  The 
<A NAME="726"></A>Wasps said that they would keep guard and drive off thieves with their 
<A NAME="727"></A>stings.  But the Farmer interrupted them, saying:  "I have already two 
<A NAME="728"></A>oxen, who, without making any promises, do all these things.  It is surely 
<A NAME="729"></A>better for me to give the water to them than to you."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="730"></A><B>The Crow and Mercury</B>

<A NAME="731"></A><BR><BR>A Crow caught in a snare prayed to Apollo to release him, making 
<A NAME="732"></A>a vow to offer some frankincense at his shrine.  But when rescued from 
<A NAME="733"></A>his danger, he forgot his promise.  Shortly afterwards, again caught in 
<A NAME="734"></A>a snare, he passed by Apollo and made the same promise to offer frankincense 
<A NAME="735"></A>to Mercury.  Mercury soon appeared and said to him, "O thou most base fellow? 
<A NAME="736"></A>how can I believe thee, who hast disowned and wronged thy former 
<A NAME="737"></A>patron?'
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="738"></A><B>The North Wind and the Sun</B>

<A NAME="739"></A><BR><BR>The North Wind and the Sun disputed as to which was the most powerful, 
<A NAME="740"></A>and agreed that he should be declared the victor who could first strip 
<A NAME="741"></A>a wayfaring man of his clothes.  The North Wind first tried his power and 
<A NAME="742"></A>blew with all his might, but the keener his blasts, the closer the Traveler 
<A NAME="743"></A>wrapped his cloak around him, until at last, resigning all hope of victory, 
<A NAME="744"></A>the Wind called upon the Sun to see what he could do.  The Sun suddenly 
<A NAME="745"></A>shone out with all his warmth.  The Traveler no sooner felt his genial 
<A NAME="746"></A>rays than he took off one garment after another, and at last, fairly overcome 
<A NAME="747"></A>with heat, undressed and bathed in a stream that lay in his 
<A NAME="748"></A>path.
<A NAME="749"></A><BR><BR>Persuasion is better than Force.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="750"></A><B>The Two Men Who Were Enemies</B>

<A NAME="751"></A><BR><BR>Two Men, deadly enemies to each other, were sailing in the same 
<A NAME="752"></A>vessel.  Determined to keep as far apart as possible, the one seated himself 
<A NAME="753"></A>in the stem, and the other in the prow of the ship.  A violent storm arose, 
<A NAME="754"></A>and with the vessel in great danger of sinking, the one in the stern inquired 
<A NAME="755"></A>of the pilot which of the two ends of the ship would go down first.  On 
<A NAME="756"></A>his replying that he supposed it would be the prow, the Man said, "Death 
<A NAME="757"></A>would not be grievous to me, if I could only see my Enemy die before 
<A NAME="758"></A>me."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="759"></A><B>The Gamecocks and the Partridge</B>

<A NAME="760"></A><BR><BR>A man had two Gamecocks in his poultry-yard.  One day by chance 
<A NAME="761"></A>he found a tame Partridge for sale.  He purchased it and brought it home 
<A NAME="762"></A>to be reared with his Gamecocks.  When the Partridge was put into the poultry-yard, 
<A NAME="763"></A>they struck at it and followed it about, so that the Partridge became grievously 
<A NAME="764"></A>troubled and supposed that he was thus evilly treated because he was a 
<A NAME="765"></A>stranger.  Not long afterwards he saw the Cocks fighting together and not 
<A NAME="766"></A>separating before one had well beaten the other.  He then said to himself, 
<A NAME="767"></A>"I shall no longer distress myself at being struck at by these Gamecocks, 
<A NAME="768"></A>when I see that they cannot even refrain from quarreling with each 
<A NAME="769"></A>other."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="770"></A><B>The Quack Frog</B>

<A NAME="771"></A><BR><BR>A Frog once upon a time came forth from his home in the marsh and 
<A NAME="772"></A>proclaimed to all the beasts that he was a learned physician, skilled in 
<A NAME="773"></A>the use of drugs and able to heal all diseases.  A Fox asked him, "How 
<A NAME="774"></A>can you pretend to prescribe for others, when you are unable to heal your 
<A NAME="775"></A>own lame gait and wrinkled skin?'
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="776"></A><B>The Lion, the Wolf, and the Fox</B>

<A NAME="777"></A><BR><BR>A Lion, growing old, lay sick in his cave.  All the beasts came 
<A NAME="778"></A>to visit their king, except the Fox.  The Wolf therefore, thinking that 
<A NAME="779"></A>he had a capital opportunity, accused the Fox to the Lion of not paying 
<A NAME="780"></A>any respect to him who had the rule over them all and of not coming to 
<A NAME="781"></A>visit him.  At that very moment the Fox came in and heard these last words 
<A NAME="782"></A>of the Wolf.  The Lion roaring out in a rage against him, the Fox sought 
<A NAME="783"></A>an opportunity to defend himself and said, "And who of all those who have 
<A NAME="784"></A>come to you have benefited you so much as I, who have traveled from place 
<A NAME="785"></A>to place in every direction, and have sought and learnt from the physicians 
<A NAME="786"></A>the means of healing you?'  The Lion commanded him immediately to tell 
<A NAME="787"></A>him the cure, when he replied, "You must flay a wolf alive and wrap his 
<A NAME="788"></A>skin yet warm around you."  The Wolf was at once taken and flayed; whereon 
<A NAME="789"></A>the Fox, turning to him, said with a smile, "You should have moved your 
<A NAME="790"></A>master not to ill, but to good, will."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="791"></A><B>The Dog's House</B>

<A NAME="792"></A><BR><BR>In the wintertime, a Dog curled up in as small a space as possible 
<A NAME="793"></A>on account of the cold, determined to make himself a house.  However when 
<A NAME="794"></A>the summer returned again, he lay asleep stretched at his full length and 
<A NAME="795"></A>appeared to himself to be of a great size.  Now he considered that it would 
<A NAME="796"></A>be neither an easy nor a necessary work to make himself such a house as 
<A NAME="797"></A>would accommodate him.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="798"></A><B>The Wolf and the Lion</B>

<A NAME="799"></A><BR><BR>Roaming by the mountainside at sundown, a Wolf saw his own shadow 
<A NAME="800"></A>become greatly extended and magnified, and he said to himself, "Why should 
<A NAME="801"></A>I, being of such an immense size and extending nearly an acre in length, 
<A NAME="802"></A>be afraid of the Lion? Ought I not to be acknowledged as King of all the 
<A NAME="803"></A>collected beasts?'  While he was indulging in these proud thoughts, a Lion
