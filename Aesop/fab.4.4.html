<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A><B>The Birds, the Beasts, and the Bat</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>The Birds waged war with the Beasts, and each were by turns the conquerors. 
<A NAME="12"></A> A Bat, fearing the uncertain issues of the fight, always fought on the 
<A NAME="13"></A>side which he felt was the strongest.  When peace was proclaimed, his deceitful 
<A NAME="14"></A>conduct was apparent to both combatants.  Therefore being condemned by 
<A NAME="15"></A>each for his treachery, he was driven forth from the light of day, and 
<A NAME="16"></A>henceforth concealed himself in dark hiding-places, flying always alone 
<A NAME="17"></A>and at night.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="18"></A><B>The Spendthrift and the Swallow</B>

<A NAME="19"></A><BR><BR>A young man, a great spendthrift, had run through all his patrimony 
<A NAME="20"></A>and had but one good cloak left.  One day he happened to see a Swallow, 
<A NAME="21"></A>which had appeared before its season, skimming along a pool and twittering 
<A NAME="22"></A>gaily.  He supposed that summer had come, and went and sold his cloak. 
<A NAME="23"></A> Not many days later, winter set in again with renewed frost and cold. 
<A NAME="24"></A> When he found the unfortunate Swallow lifeless on the ground, he said, 
<A NAME="25"></A>"Unhappy bird! what have you done? By thus appearing before the springtime 
<A NAME="26"></A>you have not only killed yourself, but you have wrought my destruction 
<A NAME="27"></A>also."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="28"></A><B>The Fox and the Lion</B>

<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR>A Fox saw a Lion confined in a cage, and standing near him, bitterly 
<A NAME="30"></A>reviled him.  The Lion said to the Fox, "It is not thou who revilest me; 
<A NAME="31"></A>but this mischance which has befallen me."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="32"></A><B>The Owl and the Birds</B>

<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR>An Owl, in her wisdom, counseled the Birds that when the acorn 
<A NAME="34"></A>first began to sprout, to pull it all up out of the ground and not allow 
<A NAME="35"></A>it to grow.  She said acorns would produce mistletoe, from which an irremediable 
<A NAME="36"></A>poison, the bird- lime, would be extracted and by which they would be captured. 
<A NAME="37"></A>The Owl next advised them to pluck up the seed of the flax, which men had 
<A NAME="38"></A>sown, as it was a plant which boded no good to them. And, lastly, the Owl, 
<A NAME="39"></A>seeing an archer approach, predicted that this man, being on foot, would 
<A NAME="40"></A>contrive darts armed with feathers which would fly faster than the wings 
<A NAME="41"></A>of the Birds themselves. The Birds gave no credence to these warning words, 
<A NAME="42"></A>but considered the Owl to be beside herself and said that she was mad. 
<A NAME="43"></A> But afterwards, finding her words were true, they wondered at her knowledge 
<A NAME="44"></A>and deemed her to be the wisest of birds.  Hence it is that when she appears 
<A NAME="45"></A>they look to her as knowing all things, while she no longer gives them 
<A NAME="46"></A>advice, but in solitude laments their past folly.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="47"></A><B>The Trumpeter Taken Prisoner</B>

<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>A Trumpeter, bravely leading on the soldiers, was captured by the 
<A NAME="49"></A>enemy.  He cried out to his captors, "Pray spare me, and do not take my 
<A NAME="50"></A>life without cause or without inquiry.  I have not slain a single man of 
<A NAME="51"></A>your troop.  I have no arms, and carry nothing but this one brass trumpet." 
<A NAME="52"></A> "That is the very reason for which you should be put to death," they said; 
<A NAME="53"></A>"for, while you do not fight yourself, your trumpet stirs all the others 
<A NAME="54"></A>to battle."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="55"></A><B>The Ass in the Lion's Skin</B>

<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR>An Ass, having put on the Lion's skin, roamed about in the forest 
<A NAME="57"></A>and amused himself by frightening all the foolish animals he met in his 
<A NAME="58"></A>wanderings.  At last coming upon a Fox, he tried to frighten him also, 
<A NAME="59"></A>but the Fox no sooner heard the sound of his voice than he exclaimed, "I 
<A NAME="60"></A>might possibly have been frightened myself, if I had not heard your 
<A NAME="61"></A>bray."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="62"></A><B>The Sparrow and the Hare</B>

<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR>A Hare pounced upon by an eagle sobbed very much and uttered cries 
<A NAME="64"></A>like a child.  A Sparrow upbraided her and said, "Where now is thy remarkable 
<A NAME="65"></A>swiftness of foot? Why were your feet so slow?" While the Sparrow was thus 
<A NAME="66"></A>speaking, a hawk suddenly seized him and killed him.  The Hare was comforted 
<A NAME="67"></A>in her death, and expiring said, "Ah! you who so lately, when you supposed 
<A NAME="68"></A>yourself safe, exulted over my calamity, have now reason to deplore a similar 
<A NAME="69"></A>misfortune."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="70"></A><B>The Flea and the Ox</B>

<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>A Flea thus questioned an Ox:  "What ails you, that being so huge 
<A NAME="72"></A>and strong, you submit to the wrongs you receive from men and slave for 
<A NAME="73"></A>them day by day, while I, being so small a creature, mercilessly feed on 
<A NAME="74"></A>their flesh and drink their blood without stint?'  The Ox replied:  "I 
<A NAME="75"></A>do not wish to be ungrateful, for I am loved and well cared for by men, 
<A NAME="76"></A>and they often pat my head and shoulders."  "Woe's me!"  said the flea; 
<A NAME="77"></A>"this very patting which you like, whenever it happens to me, brings with 
<A NAME="78"></A>it my inevitable destruction."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="79"></A><B>The Goods and the Ills</B>

<A NAME="80"></A><BR><BR>All the Goods were once driven out by the Ills from that common 
<A NAME="81"></A>share which they each had in the affairs of mankind; for the Ills by reason 
<A NAME="82"></A>of their numbers had prevailed to possess the earth. The Goods wafted themselves 
<A NAME="83"></A>to heaven and asked for a righteous vengeance on their persecutors.  They 
<A NAME="84"></A>entreated Jupiter that they might no longer be associated with the Ills, 
<A NAME="85"></A>as they had nothing in common and could not live together, but were engaged 
<A NAME="86"></A>in unceasing warfare; and that an indissoluble law might be laid down for 
<A NAME="87"></A>their future protection.  Jupiter granted their request and decreed that 
<A NAME="88"></A>henceforth the Ills should visit the earth in company with each other, 
<A NAME="89"></A>but that the Goods should one by one enter the habitations of men.  Hence 
<A NAME="90"></A>it arises that Ills abound, for they come not one by one, but in troops, 
<A NAME="91"></A>and by no means singly:  while the Goods proceed from Jupiter, and are 
<A NAME="92"></A>given, not alike to all, but singly, and separately; and one by one to 
<A NAME="93"></A>those who are able to discern them.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="94"></A><B>The Dove and the Crow</B>

<A NAME="95"></A><BR><BR>A Dove shut up in a cage was boasting of the large number of young 
<A NAME="96"></A>ones which she had hatched.  A Crow hearing her, said:  "My good friend, 
<A NAME="97"></A>cease from this unseasonable boasting.  The larger the number of your family, 
<A NAME="98"></A>the greater your cause of sorrow, in seeing them shut up in this prison-house." 
<A NAME="99"></A>Mercury and the Workmen
<A NAME="100"></A><BR><BR>A Workman, felling wood by the side of a river, let his axe drop 
<A NAME="101"></A>- by accident into a deep pool.  Being thus deprived of the means of his 
<A NAME="102"></A>livelihood, he sat down on the bank and lamented his hard fate.  Mercury 
<A NAME="103"></A>appeared and demanded the cause of his tears. After he told him his misfortune, 
<A NAME="104"></A>Mercury plunged into the stream, and, bringing up a golden axe, inquired 
<A NAME="105"></A>if that were the one he had lost.  On his saying that it was not his, Mercury 
<A NAME="106"></A>disappeared beneath the water a second time, returned with a silver axe 
<A NAME="107"></A>in his hand, and again asked the Workman if it were his.  When the Workman 
<A NAME="108"></A>said it was not, he dived into the pool for the third time and brought 
<A NAME="109"></A>up the axe that had been lost. The Workman claimed it and expressed his 
<A NAME="110"></A>joy at its recovery. Mercury, pleased with his honesty, gave him the golden 
<A NAME="111"></A>and silver axes in addition to his own.    The Workman, on his return to 
<A NAME="112"></A>his house, related to his companions all that had happened.  One of them 
<A NAME="113"></A>at once resolved to try and secure the same good fortune for himself. 
<A NAME="114"></A> He ran to the river and threw his axe on purpose into the pool at the 
<A NAME="115"></A>same place, and sat down on the bank to weep. Mercury appeared to him just 
<A NAME="116"></A>as he hoped he would; and having learned the cause of his grief, plunged 
<A NAME="117"></A>into the stream and brought up a golden axe, inquiring if he had lost it. 
<A NAME="118"></A> The Workman seized it greedily, and declared that truly it was the very 
<A NAME="119"></A>same axe that he had lost.  Mercury, displeased at his knavery, not only 
<A NAME="120"></A>took away the golden axe, but refused to recover for him the axe he had 
<A NAME="121"></A>thrown into the pool.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="122"></A><B>The Eagle and the Jackdaw</B>

<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>An Eagle, flying down from his perch on a lofty rock, seized upon 
<A NAME="124"></A>a lamb and carried him aloft in his talons.  A Jackdaw, who witnessed the 
<A NAME="125"></A>capture of the lamb, was stirred with envy and determined to emulate the 
<A NAME="126"></A>strength and flight of the Eagle.  He flew around with a great whir of 
<A NAME="127"></A>his wings and settled upon a large ram, with the intention of carrying 
<A NAME="128"></A>him off, but his claws became entangled in the ram's fleece and he was 
<A NAME="129"></A>not able to release himself, although he fluttered with his feathers as 
<A NAME="130"></A>much as he could.  The shepherd, seeing what had happened, ran up and caught 
<A NAME="131"></A>him.  He at once clipped the Jackdaw's wings, and taking him home at night, 
<A NAME="132"></A>gave him to his children.  On their saying, "Father, what kind of bird 
<A NAME="133"></A>is it?'  he replied, "To my certain knowledge he is a Daw; but he would 
<A NAME="134"></A>like you to think an Eagle."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="135"></A><B>The Fox and the Crane</B>

<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>A Fox invited a Crane to supper and provided nothing for his entertainment 
<A NAME="137"></A>but some soup made of pulse, which was poured out into a broad flat stone 
<A NAME="138"></A>dish.  The soup fell out of the long bill of the Crane at every mouthful, 
<A NAME="139"></A>and his vexation at not being able to eat afforded the Fox much amusement. 
<A NAME="140"></A> The Crane, in his turn, asked the Fox to sup with him, and set before 
<A NAME="141"></A>her a flagon with a long narrow mouth, so that he could easily insert his 
<A NAME="142"></A>neck and enjoy its contents at his leisure.  The Fox, unable even to taste 
<A NAME="143"></A>it, met with a fitting requital, after the fashion of her own 
<A NAME="144"></A>hospitality.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="145"></A><B>Jupiter, Neptune, Minerva, and Momus</B>

<A NAME="146"></A><BR><BR>According to an ancient legend, the first man was made by Jupiter, 
<A NAME="147"></A>the first bull by Neptune, and the first house by Minerva.  On the completion 
<A NAME="148"></A>of their labors, a dispute arose as to which had made the most perfect 
<A NAME="149"></A>work.  They agreed to appoint Momus as judge, and to abide by his decision. 
<A NAME="150"></A> Momus, however, being very envious of the handicraft of each, found fault 
<A NAME="151"></A>with all.  He first blamed the work of Neptune because he had not made 
<A NAME="152"></A>the horns of the bull below his eyes, so he might better see where to strike. 
<A NAME="153"></A> He then condemned the work of Jupiter, because he had not placed the heart 
<A NAME="154"></A>of man on the outside, that everyone might read the thoughts of the evil 
<A NAME="155"></A>disposed and take precautions against the intended mischief.  And, lastly, 
<A NAME="156"></A>he inveighed against Minerva because she had not contrived iron wheels 
<A NAME="157"></A>in the foundation of her house, so its inhabitants might more easily remove 
<A NAME="158"></A>if a neighbor proved unpleasant.  Jupiter, indignant at such inveterate 
<A NAME="159"></A>faultfinding, drove him from his office of judge, and expelled him from 
<A NAME="160"></A>the mansions of Olympus.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="161"></A><B>The Eagle and the Fox</B>

<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR>An Eagle and a Fox formed an intimate friendship and decided to 
<A NAME="163"></A>live near each other.  The Eagle built her nest in the branches of a tall 
<A NAME="164"></A>tree, while the Fox crept into the underwood and there produced her young. 
<A NAME="165"></A> Not long after they had agreed upon this plan, the Eagle, being in want 
<A NAME="166"></A>of provision for her young ones, swooped down while the Fox was out, seized 
<A NAME="167"></A>upon one of the little cubs, and feasted herself and her brood.  The Fox 
<A NAME="168"></A>on her return, discovered what had happened, but was less grieved for the 
<A NAME="169"></A>death of her young than for her inability to avenge them.  A just retribution, 
<A NAME="170"></A>however, quickly fell upon the Eagle.  While hovering near an altar, on 
<A NAME="171"></A>which some villagers were sacrificing a goat, she suddenly seized a piece 
<A NAME="172"></A>of the flesh, and carried it, along with a burning cinder, to her nest. 
<A NAME="173"></A> A strong breeze soon fanned the spark into a flame, and the eaglets, as 
<A NAME="174"></A>yet unfledged and helpless, were roasted in their nest and dropped down 
<A NAME="175"></A>dead at the bottom of the tree.  There, in the sight of the Eagle, the 
<A NAME="176"></A>Fox gobbled them up.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="177"></A><B>The Man and the Satyr</B>

<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR>A Man and a Satyr once drank together in token of a bond of alliance 
<A NAME="179"></A>being formed between them.  One very cold wintry day, as they talked, the 
<A NAME="180"></A>Man put his fingers to his mouth and blew on them.  When the Satyr asked 
<A NAME="181"></A>the reason for this, he told him that he did it to warm his hands because 
<A NAME="182"></A>they were so cold.  Later on in the day they sat down to eat, and the food 
<A NAME="183"></A>prepared was quite scalding.  The Man raised one of the dishes a little 
<A NAME="184"></A>towards his mouth and blew in it.  When the Satyr again inquired the reason, 
<A NAME="185"></A>he said that he did it to cool the meat, which was too hot.  "I can no 
<A NAME="186"></A>longer consider you as a friend," said the Satyr, "a fellow who with the 
<A NAME="187"></A>same breath blows hot and cold."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="188"></A><B>The Ass and His Purchaser</B>

<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR>A man wished to purchase an Ass, and agreed with its owner that 
<A NAME="190"></A>he should try out the animal before he bought him.  He took the Ass home 
<A NAME="191"></A>and put him in the straw-yard with his other Asses, upon which the new 
<A NAME="192"></A>animal left all the others and at once joined the one that was most idle 
<A NAME="193"></A>and the greatest eater of them all. Seeing this, the man put a halter on 
<A NAME="194"></A>him and led him back to his owner.  On being asked how, in so short a time, 
<A NAME="195"></A>he could have made a trial of him, he answered, "I do not need a trial; 
<A NAME="196"></A>I know that he will be just the same as the one he chose for his 
<A NAME="197"></A>companion."
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR>A man is known by the company he keeps.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="199"></A><B>The Two Bags</B>

<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR>Every man, according to an ancient legend, is born into the world 
<A NAME="201"></A>with two bags suspended from his neck   all bag in front full of his neighbors' 
<A NAME="202"></A>faults, and a large bag behind filled with his own faults.  Hence it is 
<A NAME="203"></A>that men are quick to see the faults of others, and yet are often blind 
<A NAME="204"></A>to their own failings.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="205"></A><B>The Stag At the Pool</B>

<A NAME="206"></A><BR><BR>A Stag overpowered by heat came to a spring to drink.  Seeing his 
<A NAME="207"></A>own shadow reflected in the water, he greatly admired the size and variety 
<A NAME="208"></A>of his horns, but felt angry with himself for having such slender and weak 
<A NAME="209"></A>feet.  While he was thus contemplating himself, a Lion appeared at the 
<A NAME="210"></A>pool and crouched to spring upon him.  The Stag immediately took to flight, 
<A NAME="211"></A>and exerting his utmost speed, as long as the plain was smooth and open 
<A NAME="212"></A>kept himself easily at a safe distance from the Lion.  But entering a wood 
<A NAME="213"></A>he became entangled by his horns, and the Lion quickly came up to him and 
<A NAME="214"></A>caught him.  When too late, he thus reproached himself:  "Woe is me! How 
<A NAME="215"></A>I have deceived myself! These feet which would have saved me I despised, 
<A NAME="216"></A>and I gloried in these antlers which have proved my 
<A NAME="217"></A>destruction."
<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR>What is most truly valuable is often underrated.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="219"></A><B>The Jackdaw and the Fox</B>

<A NAME="220"></A><BR><BR>A half-famished Jackdaw seated himself on a fig-tree, which had 
<A NAME="221"></A>produced some fruit entirely out of season, and waited in the hope that 
<A NAME="222"></A>the figs would ripen.  A Fox seeing him sitting so long and learning the 
<A NAME="223"></A>reason of his doing so, said to him, "You are indeed, sir, sadly deceiving 
<A NAME="224"></A>yourself; you are indulging a hope strong enough to cheat you, but which 
<A NAME="225"></A>will never reward you with enjoyment."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="226"></A><B>The Lark Burying Her Father</B>

<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR>The Lark (according to an ancient legend) was created before the 
<A NAME="228"></A>earth itself, and when her father died, as there was no earth, she could 
<A NAME="229"></A>find no place of burial for him.  She let him lie uninterred for five days, 
<A NAME="230"></A>and on the sixth day, not knowing what else to do, she buried him in her 
<A NAME="231"></A>own head.  Hence she obtained her crest, which is popularly said to be 
<A NAME="232"></A>her father's grave-hillock.
<A NAME="233"></A><BR><BR>Youth's first duty is reverence to parents.

<A NAME="234"></A><B>The Gnat and the Bull</B>

<A NAME="235"></A><BR><BR>A Gnat settled on the horn of a Bull, and sat there a long time. 
<A NAME="236"></A>Just as he was about to fly off, he made a buzzing noise, and inquired 
<A NAME="237"></A>of the Bull if he would like him to go.  The Bull replied, "I did not know 
<A NAME="238"></A>you had come, and I shall not miss you when you go away."
<A NAME="239"></A><BR><BR>Some men are of more consequence in their own eyes than in the 
<A NAME="240"></A>eyes of their neighbors.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="241"></A><B>The Bitch and Her Whelps</B>

<A NAME="242"></A><BR><BR>A Bitch, ready to whelp, earnestly begged a shepherd for a place 
<A NAME="243"></A>where she might litter.  When her request was granted, she besought permission 
<A NAME="244"></A>to rear her puppies in the same spot.  The shepherd again consented.  But 
<A NAME="245"></A>at last the Bitch, protected by the bodyguard of her Whelps, who had now 
<A NAME="246"></A>grown up and were able to defend themselves, asserted her exclusive right 
<A NAME="247"></A>to the place and would not permit the shepherd to approach.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="248"></A><B>The Dogs and the Hides</B>

<A NAME="249"></A><BR><BR>Some Dogs famished with hunger saw a number of cowhides steeping 
<A NAME="250"></A>in a river.  Not being able to reach them, they agreed to drink up the 
<A NAME="251"></A>river, but it happened that they burst themselves with drinking long before 
<A NAME="252"></A>they reached the hides.
<A NAME="253"></A><BR><BR>Attempt not impossibilities.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="254"></A><B>The Shepherd and the Sheep</B>

<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR>A Shepherd driving his Sheep to a wood, saw an oak of unusual size 
<A NAME="256"></A>full of acorns, and spreading his cloak under the branches, he climbed 
<A NAME="257"></A>up into the tree and shook them down.  The Sheep eating the acorns inadvertently 
<A NAME="258"></A>frayed and tore the cloak.  When the Shepherd came down and saw what was 
<A NAME="259"></A>done, he said, "O you most ungrateful creatures! You provide wool to make 
<A NAME="260"></A>garments for all other men, but you destroy the clothes of him who feeds 
<A NAME="261"></A>you."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="262"></A><B>The Grasshopper and the Owl</B>

<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR>An Owl, accustomed to feed at night and to sleep during the day, 
<A NAME="264"></A>was greatly disturbed by the noise of a Grasshopper and earnestly besought 
<A NAME="265"></A>her to stop chirping.  The Grasshopper refused to desist, and chirped louder 
<A NAME="266"></A>and louder the more the Owl entreated. When she saw that she could get 
<A NAME="267"></A>no redress and that her words were despised, the Owl attacked the chatterer 
<A NAME="268"></A>by a stratagem. "Since I cannot sleep," she said, "on account of your song 
<A NAME="269"></A>which, believe me, is sweet as the lyre of Apollo, I shall indulge myself 
<A NAME="270"></A>in drinking some nectar which Pallas lately gave me.  If you do not dislike 
<A NAME="271"></A>it, come to me and we will drink it together." The Grasshopper, who was 
<A NAME="272"></A>thirsty, and pleased with the praise of her voice, eagerly flew up.  The 
<A NAME="273"></A>Owl came forth from her hollow, seized her, and put her to 
<A NAME="274"></A>death.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="275"></A><B>The Monkey and the Camel</B>

<A NAME="276"></A><BR><BR>The beasts of the forest gave a splendid entertainment at which 
<A NAME="277"></A>the Monkey stood up and danced.  Having vastly delighted the assembly, 
<A NAME="278"></A>he sat down amidst universal applause.  The Camel, envious of the praises 
<A NAME="279"></A>bestowed on the Monkey and desiring to divert to himself the favor of the 
<A NAME="280"></A>guests, proposed to stand up in his turn and dance for their amusement. 
<A NAME="281"></A> He moved about in so utterly ridiculous a manner that the Beasts, in a 
<A NAME="282"></A>fit of indignation, set upon him with clubs and drove him out of the 
<A NAME="283"></A>assembly.
<A NAME="284"></A><BR><BR>It is absurd to ape our betters.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="285"></A><B>The Peasant and the Apple-Tree</B>

<A NAME="286"></A><BR><BR>A Peasant had in his garden an Apple-Tree which bore no fruit but 
<A NAME="287"></A>only served as a harbor for the sparrows and grasshoppers.  He resolved 
<A NAME="288"></A>to cut it down, and taking his axe in his hand, made a bold stroke at its 
<A NAME="289"></A>roots.  The grasshoppers and sparrows entreated him not to cut down the 
<A NAME="290"></A>tree that sheltered them, but to spare it, and they would sing to him and 
<A NAME="291"></A>lighten his labors. He paid no attention to their request, but gave the 
<A NAME="292"></A>tree a second and a third blow with his axe.  When he reached the hollow 
<A NAME="293"></A>of the tree, he found a hive full of honey.  Having tasted the honeycomb, 
<A NAME="294"></A>he threw down his axe, and looking on the tree as sacred, took great care 
<A NAME="295"></A>of it.
<A NAME="296"></A><BR><BR>Self-interest alone moves some men.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="297"></A><B>The Two Soldiers and the Robber</B>

<A NAME="298"></A><BR><BR>Two Soldiers traveling together were set upon by a Robber.  The 
<A NAME="299"></A>one fled away; the other stood his ground and defended himself with his 
<A NAME="300"></A>stout right hand.  The Robber being slain, the timid companion ran up and 
<A NAME="301"></A>drew his sword, and then, throwing back his traveling cloak said, "I'll 
<A NAME="302"></A>at him, and I'll take care he shall learn whom he has attacked."  On this, 
<A NAME="303"></A>he who had fought with the Robber made answer, "I only wish that you had 
<A NAME="304"></A>helped me just now, even if it had been only with those words, for I should 
<A NAME="305"></A>have been the more encouraged, believing them to be true; but now put up 
<A NAME="306"></A>your sword in its sheath and hold your equally useless tongue, till you 
<A NAME="307"></A>can deceive others who do not know you.  I, indeed, who have experienced 
<A NAME="308"></A>with what speed you run away, know right well that no dependence can be 
<A NAME="309"></A>placed on your valor."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="310"></A><B>The Trees Under the Protection of the Gods</B>

<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR>The Gods, according to an ancient legend, made choice of certain 
<A NAME="312"></A>trees to be under their special protection.  Jupiter chose the oak, Venus 
<A NAME="313"></A>the myrtle, Apollo the laurel, Cybele the pine, and Hercules the poplar. 
<A NAME="314"></A> Minerva, wondering why they had preferred trees not yielding fruit, inquired 
<A NAME="315"></A>the reason for their choice. Jupiter replied, "It is lest we should seem 
<A NAME="316"></A>to covet the honor for the fruit."  But said Minerva, "Let anyone say what 
<A NAME="317"></A>he will the olive is more dear to me on account of its fruit."  Then said 
<A NAME="318"></A>Jupiter, "My daughter, you are rightly called wise; for unless what we 
<A NAME="319"></A>do is useful, the glory of it is vain."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="320"></A><B>The Mother and the Wolf</B>

<A NAME="321"></A><BR><BR>A famished Wolf was prowling about in the morning in search of 
<A NAME="322"></A>food.  As he passed the door of a cottage built in the forest, he heard 
<A NAME="323"></A>a Mother say to her child, "Be quiet, or I will throw you out of the window, 
<A NAME="324"></A>and the Wolf shall eat you."  The Wolf sat all day waiting at the door. 
<A NAME="325"></A> In the evening he heard the same woman fondling her child and saying: 
<A NAME="326"></A> "You are quiet now, and if the Wolf should come, we will kill him."  The 
<A NAME="327"></A>Wolf, hearing these words, went home, gasping with cold and hunger.  When 
<A NAME="328"></A>he reached his den, Mistress Wolf inquired of him why he returned wearied 
<A NAME="329"></A>and supperless, so contrary to his wont.  He replied:  "Why, forsooth! 
<A NAME="330"></A>use I gave credence to the words of a woman!"
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="331"></A><B>The Ass and the Horse</B>

<A NAME="332"></A><BR><BR>An Ass besought a Horse to spare him a small portion of his feed. 
<A NAME="333"></A>"Yes," said the Horse; "if any remains out of what I am now eating I will 
<A NAME="334"></A>give it you for the sake of my own superior dignity, and if you will come 
<A NAME="335"></A>when I reach my own stall in the evening, I will give you a little sack 
<A NAME="336"></A>full of barley."  The Ass replied, "Thank you.  But I can't think that 
<A NAME="337"></A>you, who refuse me a little matter now.  will by and by confer on me a 
<A NAME="338"></A>greater benefit."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="339"></A><B>Truth and the Traveler</B>

<A NAME="340"></A><BR><BR>A wayfaring man, traveling in the desert, met a woman standing 
<A NAME="341"></A>alone and terribly dejected.  He inquired of her, "Who art thou?" "My name 
<A NAME="342"></A>is Truth," she replied.  "And for what cause," he asked, "have you left 
<A NAME="343"></A>the city to dwell alone here in the wilderness?" She made answer, "Because 
<A NAME="344"></A>in former times, falsehood was with few, but is now with all 
<A NAME="345"></A>men."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="346"></A><B>The Manslayer</B>

<A NAME="347"></A><BR><BR>A man committed a murder, and was pursued by the relations of the 
<A NAME="348"></A>man whom he murdered.  On his reaching the river Nile he saw a Lion on 
<A NAME="349"></A>its bank and being fearfully afraid, climbed up a tree. He found a serpent 
<A NAME="350"></A>in the upper branches of the tree, and again being greatly alarmed, he 
<A NAME="351"></A>threw himself into the river, where a crocodile caught him and ate him. 
<A NAME="352"></A> Thus the earth, the air, and the water alike refused shelter to a 
<A NAME="353"></A>murderer.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="354"></A><B>The Lion and the Fox</B>

<A NAME="355"></A><BR><BR>A Fox entered into partnership with a Lion on the pretense of becoming 
<A NAME="356"></A>his servant.  Each undertook his proper duty in accordance with his own 
<A NAME="357"></A>nature and powers.  The Fox discovered and pointed out the prey; the Lion 
<A NAME="358"></A>sprang on it and seized it. The Fox soon became jealous of the Lion carrying 
<A NAME="359"></A>off the Lion's share, and said that he would no longer find out the prey, 
<A NAME="360"></A>but would capture it on his own account.  The next day he attempted to 
<A NAME="361"></A>snatch a lamb from the fold, but he himself fell prey to the huntsmen and 
<A NAME="362"></A>hounds.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="363"></A><B>The Lion and the Eagle</B>

<A NAME="364"></A><BR><BR>An Eagle stayed his flight and entreated a Lion to make an alliance 
<A NAME="365"></A>with him to their mutual advantage.  The Lion replied, "I have no objection, 
<A NAME="366"></A>but you must excuse me for requiring you to find surety for your good faith, 
<A NAME="367"></A>for how can I trust anyone as a friend who is able to fly away from his 
<A NAME="368"></A>bargain whenever he pleases?'
<A NAME="369"></A><BR><BR>Try before you trust.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="370"></A><B>The Hen and the Swallow</B>

<A NAME="371"></A><BR><BR>A Hen finding the eggs of a viper and carefully keeping them warm, 
<A NAME="372"></A>nourished them into life.  A Swallow, observing what she had done, said, 
<A NAME="373"></A>"You silly creature! why have you hatched these vipers which, when they 
<A NAME="374"></A>shall have grown, will inflict injury on all, beginning with 
<A NAME="375"></A>yourself?'
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="376"></A><B>The Buffoon and the Countryman</B>

<A NAME="377"></A><BR><BR>A rich nobleman once opened the theaters without charge to the 
<A NAME="378"></A>people, and gave a public notice that he would handsomely reward any person 
<A NAME="379"></A>who invented a new amusement for the occasion. Various public performers 
<A NAME="380"></A>contended for the prize.  Among them came a Buffoon well known among the 
<A NAME="381"></A>populace for his jokes, and said that he had a kind of entertainment which 
<A NAME="382"></A>had never been brought out on any stage before.  This report being spread 
<A NAME="383"></A>about made a great stir, and the theater was crowded in every part. The 
<A NAME="384"></A>Buffoon appeared alone upon the platform, without any apparatus or confederates, 
<A NAME="385"></A>and the very sense of expectation caused an intense silence.  He suddenly 
<A NAME="386"></A>bent his head towards his bosom and imitated the squeaking of a little 
<A NAME="387"></A>pig so admirably with his voice that the audience declared he had a porker 
<A NAME="388"></A>under his cloak, and demanded that it should be shaken out.  When that 
<A NAME="389"></A>was done and nothing was found, they cheered the actor, and loaded him 
<A NAME="390"></A>with the loudest applause.  A Countryman in the crowd, observing all that 
<A NAME="391"></A>has passed, said, "So help me, Hercules, he shall not beat me at that trick!" 
<A NAME="392"></A> and at once proclaimed that he would do the same thing on the next day, 
<A NAME="393"></A>though in a much more natural way.  On the morrow a still larger crowd 
<A NAME="394"></A>assembled in the theater, but now partiality for their favorite actor very 
<A NAME="395"></A>generally prevailed, and the audience came rather to ridicule the Countryman 
<A NAME="396"></A>than to see the spectacle.  Both of the performers appeared on the stage. 
<A NAME="397"></A> The Buffoon grunted and squeaked away first, and obtained, as on the preceding 
<A NAME="398"></A>day, the applause and cheers of the spectators.  Next the Countryman commenced, 
<A NAME="399"></A>and pretending that he concealed a little pig beneath his clothes (which 
<A NAME="400"></A>in truth he did, but not suspected by the audience ) contrived to take 
<A NAME="401"></A>hold of and to pull his ear causing the pig to squeak.  The Crowd, however, 
<A NAME="402"></A>cried out with one consent that the Buffoon had given a far more exact 
<A NAME="403"></A>imitation, and clamored for the Countryman to be kicked out of the theater. 
<A NAME="404"></A> On this the rustic produced the little pig from his cloak and showed by 
<A NAME="405"></A>the most positive proof the greatness of their mistake.  "Look here," he 
<A NAME="406"></A>said, "this shows what sort of judges you are."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="407"></A><B>The Crow and the Serpent</B>

<A NAME="408"></A><BR><BR>A Crow in great want of food saw a Serpent asleep in a sunny nook, 
<A NAME="409"></A>and flying down, greedily seized him.  The Serpent, turning about, bit 
<A NAME="410"></A>the Crow with a mortal wound.  In the agony of death, the bird exclaimed: 
<A NAME="411"></A> "O unhappy me! who have found in that which I deemed a happy windfall 
<A NAME="412"></A>the source of my destruction."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="413"></A><B>The Hunter and the Horseman</B>

<A NAME="414"></A><BR><BR>A certain Hunter, having snared a hare, placed it upon his shoulders 
<A NAME="415"></A>and set out homewards.  On his way he met a man on horseback who begged 
<A NAME="416"></A>the hare of him, under the pretense of purchasing it.  However, when the 
<A NAME="417"></A>Horseman got the hare, he rode off as fast as he could.  The Hunter ran 
<A NAME="418"></A>after him, as if he was sure of overtaking him, but the Horseman increased 
<A NAME="419"></A>more and more the distance between them.  The Hunter, sorely against his 
<A NAME="420"></A>will, called out to him and said, "Get along with you! for I will now make 
<A NAME="421"></A>you a present of the hare."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="422"></A><B>The King's Son and the Painted Lion</B>

<A NAME="423"></A><BR><BR>A King, whose only son was fond of martial exercises, had a dream 
<A NAME="424"></A>in which he was warned that his son would be killed by a lion. Afraid the 
<A NAME="425"></A>dream should prove true, he built for his son a pleasant palace and adorned 
<A NAME="426"></A>its walls for his amusement with all kinds of life-sized animals, among 
<A NAME="427"></A>which was the picture of a lion.  When the young Prince saw this, his grief 
<A NAME="428"></A>at being thus confined burst out afresh, and, standing near the lion, he 
<A NAME="429"></A>said: "O you most detestable of animals! through a lying dream of my father's, 
<A NAME="430"></A>which he saw in his sleep, I am shut up on your account in this palace 
<A NAME="431"></A>as if I had been a girl:  what shall I now do to you?'  With these words 
<A NAME="432"></A>he stretched out his hands toward a thorn-tree, meaning to cut a stick 
<A NAME="433"></A>from its branches so that he might beat the lion.  But one of the tree's 
<A NAME="434"></A>prickles pierced his finger and caused great pain and inflammation, so 
<A NAME="435"></A>that the young Prince fell down in a fainting fit.  A violent fever suddenly 
<A NAME="436"></A>set in, from which he died not many days later.
<A NAME="437"></A><BR><BR>We had better bear our troubles bravely than try to escape 
<A NAME="438"></A>them.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="439"></A><B>The Cat and Venus</B>

<A NAME="440"></A><BR><BR>A Cat fell in love with a handsome young man, and entreated Venus 
<A NAME="441"></A>to change her into the form of a woman.  Venus consented to her request 
<A NAME="442"></A>and transformed her into a beautiful damsel, so that the youth saw her 
<A NAME="443"></A>and loved her, and took her home as his bride. While the two were reclining 
<A NAME="444"></A>in their chamber, Venus wishing to discover if the Cat in her change of 
<A NAME="445"></A>shape had also altered her habits of life, let down a mouse in the middle 
<A NAME="446"></A>of the room.  The Cat, quite forgetting her present condition, started 
<A NAME="447"></A>up from the couch and pursued the mouse, wishing to eat it.  Venus was 
<A NAME="448"></A>much disappointed and again caused her to return to her former 
<A NAME="449"></A>shape.
<A NAME="450"></A><BR><BR>Nature exceeds nurture.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="451"></A><B>The She-Goats and Their Beards</B>

<A NAME="452"></A><BR><BR>The She-Goats having obtained a beard by request to Jupiter, the 
<A NAME="453"></A>He-Goats were sorely displeased and made complaint that the females equaled 
<A NAME="454"></A>them in dignity.  "Allow them," said Jupiter, "to enjoy an empty honor 
<A NAME="455"></A>and to assume the badge of your nobler sex, so long as they are not your 
<A NAME="456"></A>equals in strength or courage."
<A NAME="457"></A><BR><BR>It matters little if those who are inferior to us in merit should 
<A NAME="458"></A>be like us in outside appearances.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="459"></A><B>The Camel and the Arab</B>

<A NAME="460"></A><BR><BR>An Arab camel-driver, after completing the loading of his Camel, 
<A NAME="461"></A>asked him which he would like best, to go up hill or down.  The poor beast 
<A NAME="462"></A>replied, not without a touch of reason:  "Why do you ask me? Is it that 
<A NAME="463"></A>the level way through the desert is closed?"
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="464"></A><B>The Miller, His Son, and Their Ass</B>

<A NAME="465"></A><BR><BR>A Miller and his son were driving their Ass to a neighboring fair 
<A NAME="466"></A>to sell him.  They had not gone far when they met with a troop of women 
<A NAME="467"></A>collected round a well, talking and laughing.  "Look there," cried one 
<A NAME="468"></A>of them, "did you ever see such fellows, to be trudging along the road 
<A NAME="469"></A>on foot when they might ride?'  The old man hearing this, quickly made 
<A NAME="470"></A>his son mount the Ass, and continued to walk along merrily by his side. 
<A NAME="471"></A> Presently they came up to a group of old men in earnest debate.  "There," 
<A NAME="472"></A>said one of them, "it proves what I was a-saying.  What respect is shown 
<A NAME="473"></A>to old age in these days? Do you see that idle lad riding while his old 
<A NAME="474"></A>father has to walk? Get down, you young scapegrace, and let the old man 
<A NAME="475"></A>rest his weary limbs."  Upon this the old man made his son dismount, and 
<A NAME="476"></A>got up himself.  In this manner they had not proceeded far when they met 
<A NAME="477"></A>a company of women and children: "Why, you lazy old fellow," cried several 
<A NAME="478"></A>tongues at once, "how can you ride upon the beast, while that poor little 
<A NAME="479"></A>lad there can hardly keep pace by the side of you?'  The good-natured Miller 
<A NAME="480"></A>immediately took up his son behind him.  They had now almost reached the 
<A NAME="481"></A>town.    "Pray, honest friend," said a citizen, "is that Ass your own?' 
<A NAME="482"></A> "Yes," replied the old man.  "O, one would not have thought so," said 
<A NAME="483"></A>the other, "by the way you load him. Why, you two fellows are better able 
<A NAME="484"></A>to carry the poor beast than he you."  "Anything to please you," said the 
<A NAME="485"></A>old man; "we can but try."  So, alighting with his son, they tied the legs 
<A NAME="486"></A>of the Ass together and with the help of a pole endeavored to carry him 
<A NAME="487"></A>on their shoulders over a bridge near the entrance to the town. This entertaining 
<A NAME="488"></A>sight brought the people in crowds to laugh at it, till the Ass, not liking 
<A NAME="489"></A>the noise nor the strange handling that he was subject to, broke the cords 
<A NAME="490"></A>that bound him and, tumbling off the pole, fell into the river.  Upon this, 
<A NAME="491"></A>the old man, vexed and ashamed, made the best of his way home again, convinced 
<A NAME="492"></A>that by endeavoring to please everybody he had pleased nobody, and lost 
<A NAME="493"></A>his Ass in the bargain.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="494"></A><B>The Crow and the Sheep</B>

<A NAME="495"></A><BR><BR>A troublesome Crow seated herself on the back of a Sheep.  The 
<A NAME="496"></A>Sheep, much against his will, carried her backward and forward for a long 
<A NAME="497"></A>time, and at last said, "If you had treated a dog in this way, you would 
<A NAME="498"></A>have had your deserts from his sharp teeth." To this the Crow replied, 
<A NAME="499"></A>"I despise the weak and yield to the strong.  I know whom I may bully and 
<A NAME="500"></A>whom I must flatter; and I thus prolong my life to a good old 
<A NAME="501"></A>age."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="502"></A><B>The Fox and the Bramble</B>

<A NAME="503"></A><BR><BR>A Fox was mounting a hedge when he lost his footing and caught 
<A NAME="504"></A>hold of a Bramble to save himself.  Having pricked and grievously tom the 
<A NAME="505"></A>soles of his feet, he accused the Bramble because, when he had fled to 
<A NAME="506"></A>her for assistance, she had used him worse than the hedge itself.  The 
<A NAME="507"></A>Bramble, interrupting him, said, "But you really must have been out of 
<A NAME="508"></A>your senses to fasten yourself on me, who am myself always accustomed to 
<A NAME="509"></A>fasten upon others."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="510"></A><B>The Wolf and the Lion</B>

<A NAME="511"></A><BR><BR>A Wolf, having stolen a lamb from a fold, was carrying him off 
<A NAME="512"></A>to his lair.  A Lion met him in the path, and seizing the lamb, took it 
<A NAME="513"></A>from him.  Standing at a safe distance, the Wolf exclaimed, "You have unrighteously 
<A NAME="514"></A>taken that which was mine from me!"  To which the Lion jeeringly replied, 
<A NAME="515"></A>"It was righteously yours, eh? The gift of a friend?'
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="516"></A><B>The Dog and the Oyster</B>

<A NAME="517"></A><BR><BR>A Dog, used to eating eggs, saw an Oyster and, opening his mouth 
<A NAME="518"></A>to its widest extent, swallowed it down with the utmost relish, supposing 
<A NAME="519"></A>it to be an egg.  Soon afterwards suffering great pain in his stomach, 
<A NAME="520"></A>he said, "I deserve all this torment, for my folly in thinking that everything 
<A NAME="521"></A>round must be an egg."
<A NAME="522"></A><BR><BR>They who act without sufficient thought, will often fall into unsuspected 
<A NAME="523"></A>danger.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="524"></A><B>The Ant and the Dove</B>

<A NAME="525"></A><BR><BR>An Ant went to the bank of a river to quench its thirst, and being 
<A NAME="526"></A>carried away by the rush of the stream, was on the point of drowning. 
<A NAME="527"></A> A Dove sitting on a tree overhanging the water plucked a leaf and let 
<A NAME="528"></A>it fall into the stream close to her.  The Ant climbed onto it and floated 
<A NAME="529"></A>in safety to the bank.  Shortly afterwards a birdcatcher came and stood 
<A NAME="530"></A>under the tree, and laid his lime-twigs for the Dove, which sat in the 
<A NAME="531"></A>branches.  The Ant, perceiving his design, stung him in the foot.  In pain 
<A NAME="532"></A>the birdcatcher threw down the twigs, and the noise made the Dove take 
<A NAME="533"></A>wing.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="534"></A><B>The Partridge and the Fowler</B>

<A NAME="535"></A><BR><BR>A Fowler caught a Partridge and was about to kill it.  The Partridge 
<A NAME="536"></A>earnestly begged him to spare his life, saying, "Pray, master, permit me 
<A NAME="537"></A>to live and I will entice many Partridges to you in recompense for your 
<A NAME="538"></A>mercy to me."  The Fowler replied, "I shall now with less scruple take 
<A NAME="539"></A>your life, because you are willing to save it at the cost of betraying 
<A NAME="540"></A>your friends and relations."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="541"></A><B>The Flea and the Man</B>

<A NAME="542"></A><BR><BR>A Man, very much annoyed with a Flea, caught him at last, and said, 
<A NAME="543"></A>"Who are you who dare to feed on my limbs, and to cost me so much trouble 
<A NAME="544"></A>in catching you?'  The Flea replied, "O my dear sir, pray spare my life, 
<A NAME="545"></A>and destroy me not, for I cannot possibly do you much harm."  The Man, 
<A NAME="546"></A>laughing, replied, "Now you shall certainly die by mine own hands, for 
<A NAME="547"></A>no evil, whether it be small or large, ought to be tolerated."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="548"></A><B>The Thieves and the Cock</B>

<A NAME="549"></A><BR><BR>Some Thieves broke into a house and found nothing but a Cock, whom 
<A NAME="550"></A>they stole, and got off as fast as they could.  Upon arriving at home they 
<A NAME="551"></A>prepared to kill the Cock, who thus pleaded for his life:  "Pray spare 
<A NAME="552"></A>me; I am very serviceable to men.  I wake them up in the night to their 
<A NAME="553"></A>work."  "That is the very reason why we must the more kill you," they replied; 
<A NAME="554"></A>"for when you wake your neighbors, you entirely put an end to our 
<A NAME="555"></A>business."
<A NAME="556"></A><BR><BR>The safeguards of virtue are hateful to those with evil 
<A NAME="557"></A>intentions.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="558"></A><B>The Dog and the Cook</B>

<A NAME="559"></A><BR><BR>A rich man gave a great feast, to which he invited many friends 
<A NAME="560"></A>and acquaintances.  His Dog availed himself of the occasion to invite a 
<A NAME="561"></A>stranger Dog, a friend of his, saying, "My master gives a feast, and there 
<A NAME="562"></A>is always much food remaining; come and sup with me tonight."  The Dog 
<A NAME="563"></A>thus invited went at the hour appointed, and seeing the preparations for 
<A NAME="564"></A>so grand an entertainment, said in the joy of his heart, "How glad I am 
<A NAME="565"></A>that I came! I do not often get such a chance as this.  I will take care 
<A NAME="566"></A>and eat enough to last me both today and tomorrow."  While he was congratulating 
<A NAME="567"></A>himself and wagging his tail to convey his pleasure to his friend, the 
<A NAME="568"></A>Cook saw him moving about among his dishes and, seizing him by his fore 
<A NAME="569"></A>and hind paws, bundled him without ceremony out of the window.  He fell 
<A NAME="570"></A>with force upon the ground and limped away, howling dreadfully.  His yelling 
<A NAME="571"></A>soon attracted other street dogs, who came up to him and inquired how he 
<A NAME="572"></A>had enjoyed his supper.  He replied, "Why, to tell you the truth, I drank 
<A NAME="573"></A>so much wine that I remember nothing.  I do not know how I got out of the 
<A NAME="574"></A>house."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="575"></A><B>The Travelers and the Plane-Tree</B>

<A NAME="576"></A><BR><BR>Two Travelers, worn out by the heat of the summer's sun, laid themselves 
<A NAME="577"></A>down at noon under the widespreading branches of a Plane-Tree.  As they 
<A NAME="578"></A>rested under its shade, one of the Travelers said to the other, "What a 
<A NAME="579"></A>singularly useless tree is the Plane! It bears no fruit, and is not of 
<A NAME="580"></A>the least service to man."  The Plane-Tree, interrupting him, said, "You 
<A NAME="581"></A>ungrateful fellows! Do you, while receiving benefits from me and resting 
<A NAME="582"></A>under my shade, dare to describe me as useless, and 
<A NAME="583"></A>unprofitable?'
<A NAME="584"></A><BR><BR>Some men underrate their best blessings.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="585"></A><B>The Hares and the Frogs</B>

<A NAME="586"></A><BR><BR>The Hares, oppressed by their own exceeding timidity and weary 
<A NAME="587"></A>of the perpetual alarm to which they were exposed, with one accord determined 
<A NAME="588"></A>to put an end to themselves and their troubles by jumping from a lofty 
<A NAME="589"></A>precipice into a deep lake below.  As they scampered off in large numbers 
<A NAME="590"></A>to carry out their resolve, the Frogs lying on the banks of the lake heard 
<A NAME="591"></A>the noise of their feet and rushed helter-skelter to the deep water for 
<A NAME="592"></A>safety.  On seeing the rapid disappearance of the Frogs, one of the Hares 
<A NAME="593"></A>cried out to his companions:  "Stay, my friends, do not do as you intended; 
<A NAME="594"></A>for you now see that there are creatures who are still more timid than 
<A NAME="595"></A>ourselves."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="596"></A><B>The Lion, Jupiter, and the Elephant</B>

<A NAME="597"></A><BR><BR>The Lion wearied Jupiter with his frequent complaints.  "It is 
<A NAME="598"></A>true, O Jupiter!"  he said, "that I am gigantic in strength, handsome in 
<A NAME="599"></A>shape, and powerful in attack.  I have jaws well provided with teeth, and 
<A NAME="600"></A>feet furnished with claws, and I lord it over all the beasts of the forest, 
<A NAME="601"></A>and what a disgrace it is, that being such as I am, I should be frightened 
<A NAME="602"></A>by the crowing of a cock."  Jupiter replied, "Why do you blame me without 
<A NAME="603"></A>a cause? I have given you all the attributes which I possess myself, and 
<A NAME="604"></A>your courage never fails you except in this one instance."  On hearing 
<A NAME="605"></A>this the Lion groaned and lamented very much and, reproaching himself with 
<A NAME="606"></A>his cowardice, wished that he might die. As these thoughts passed through 
<A NAME="607"></A>his mind, he met an Elephant and came close to hold a conversation with 
<A NAME="608"></A>him.  After a time he observed that the Elephant shook his ears very often, 
<A NAME="609"></A>and he inquired what was the matter and why his ears moved with such a 
<A NAME="610"></A>tremor every now and then.  Just at that moment a Gnat settled on the head 
<A NAME="611"></A>of the Elephant, and he replied, "Do you see that little buzzing insect? 
<A NAME="612"></A>If it enters my ear, my fate is sealed.  I should die presently."  The 
<A NAME="613"></A>Lion said, "Well, since so huge a beast is afraid of a tiny gnat, I will 
<A NAME="614"></A>no more complain, nor wish myself dead.  I find myself, even as I am, better 
<A NAME="615"></A>off than the Elephant."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="616"></A><B>The Lamb and the Wolf</B>

<A NAME="617"></A><BR><BR>A Wolf pursued a Lamb, which fled for refuge to a certain Temple. 
<A NAME="618"></A>The Wolf called out to him and said, "The Priest will slay you in sacrifice, 
<A NAME="619"></A>if he should catch you."  On which the Lamb replied, "It would be better 
<A NAME="620"></A>for me to be sacrificed in the Temple than to be eaten by 
<A NAME="621"></A>you."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="622"></A><B>The Rich Man and the Tanner</B>

<A NAME="623"></A><BR><BR>A rich man lived near a Tanner, and not being able to bear the 
<A NAME="624"></A>unpleasant smell of the tan-yard, he pressed his neighbor to go away. 
<A NAME="625"></A> The Tanner put off his departure from time to time, saying that he would 
<A NAME="626"></A>leave soon.  But as he still continued to stay, as time went on, the rich 
<A NAME="627"></A>man became accustomed to the smell, and feeling no manner of inconvenience, 
<A NAME="628"></A>made no further complaints.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="629"></A><B>The Shipwrecked Man and the Sea</B>

<A NAME="630"></A><BR><BR>A shipwrecked man, having been cast upon a certain shore, slept 
<A NAME="631"></A>after his buffetings with the deep.  After a while he awoke, and looking 
<A NAME="632"></A>upon the Sea, loaded it with reproaches.  He argued that it enticed men 
<A NAME="633"></A>with the calmness of its looks, but when it had induced them to plow its 
<A NAME="634"></A>waters, it grew rough and destroyed them.  The Sea, assuming the form of 
<A NAME="635"></A>a woman, replied to him: "Blame not me, my good sir, but the winds, for 
<A NAME="636"></A>I am by my own nature as calm and firm even as this earth; but the winds 
<A NAME="637"></A>suddenly falling on me create these waves, and lash me into 
<A NAME="638"></A>fury."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="639"></A><B>The Mules and the Robbers</B>

<A NAME="640"></A><BR><BR>Two Mules well-laden with packs were trudging along.  One carried 
<A NAME="641"></A>panniers filled with money, the other sacks weighted with grain. The Mule 
<A NAME="642"></A>carrying the treasure walked with head erect, as if conscious of the value 
<A NAME="643"></A>of his burden, and tossed up and down the clear-toned bells fastened to 
<A NAME="644"></A>his neck.  His companion followed with quiet and easy step.  All of a sudden 
<A NAME="645"></A>Robbers rushed upon them from their hiding-places, and in the scuffle with 
<A NAME="646"></A>their owners, wounded with a sword the Mule carrying the treasure, which 
<A NAME="647"></A>they greedily seized while taking no notice of the grain. The Mule which 
<A NAME="648"></A>had been robbed and wounded bewailed his misfortunes.  The other replied, 
<A NAME="649"></A>"I am indeed glad that I was thought so little of, for I have lost nothing, 
<A NAME="650"></A>nor am I hurt with any wound."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="651"></A><B>The Viper and the File</B>

<A NAME="652"></A><BR><BR>A Lion, entering the workshop of a smith, sought from the tools 
<A NAME="653"></A>the means of satisfying his hunger.  He more particularly addressed himself 
<A NAME="654"></A>to a File, and asked of him the favor of a meal.  The File replied, "You 
<A NAME="655"></A>must indeed be a simple-minded fellow if you expect to get anything from 
<A NAME="656"></A>me, who am accustomed to take from everyone, and never to give anything 
<A NAME="657"></A>in return."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="658"></A><B>The Lion and the Shepherd</B>

<A NAME="659"></A><BR><BR>A Lion, roaming through a forest, trod upon a thorn.  Soon afterward 
<A NAME="660"></A>he came up to a Shepherd and fawned upon him, wagging his tail as if to 
<A NAME="661"></A>say, "I am a suppliant, and seek your aid."  The Shepherd boldly examined 
<A NAME="662"></A>the beast, discovered the thorn, and placing his paw upon his lap, pulled 
<A NAME="663"></A>it out; thus relieved of his pain, the Lion returned into the forest. 
<A NAME="664"></A> Some time after, the Shepherd, being imprisoned on a false accusation, 
<A NAME="665"></A>was condemned "to be cast to the Lions" as the punishment for his imputed 
<A NAME="666"></A>crime.  But when the Lion was released from his cage, he recognized the 
<A NAME="667"></A>Shepherd as the man who healed him, and instead of attacking him, approached 
<A NAME="668"></A>and placed his foot upon his lap.  The King, as soon as he heard the tale, 
<A NAME="669"></A>ordered the Lion to be set free again in the forest, and the Shepherd to 
<A NAME="670"></A>be pardoned and restored to his friends.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="671"></A><B>The Camel and Jupiter</B>

<A NAME="672"></A><BR><BR>The Camel, when he saw the Bull adorned with horns, envied him 
<A NAME="673"></A>and wished that he himself could obtain the same honors.  He went to Jupiter, 
<A NAME="674"></A>and besought him to give him horns.  Jupiter, vexed at his request because 
<A NAME="675"></A>he was not satisfied with his size and strength of body, and desired yet 
<A NAME="676"></A>more, not only refused to give him horns, but even deprived him of a portion 
<A NAME="677"></A>of his ears.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="678"></A><B>The Panther and the Shepherds</B>

<A NAME="679"></A><BR><BR>A Panther, by some mischance, fell into a pit.  The Shepherds discovered 
<A NAME="680"></A>him, and some threw sticks at him and pelted him with stones, while others, 
<A NAME="681"></A>moved with compassion towards one about to die even though no one should 
<A NAME="682"></A>hurt him, threw in some food to prolong his life.  At night they returned 
<A NAME="683"></A>home, not dreaming of any danger, but supposing that on the morrow they 
<A NAME="684"></A>would find him dead.  The Panther, however, when he had recruited his feeble 
<A NAME="685"></A>strength, freed himself with a sudden bound from the pit, and hastened 
<A NAME="686"></A>to his den with rapid steps.  After a few days he came forth and slaughtered 
<A NAME="687"></A>the cattle, and, killing the Shepherds who had attacked him, raged with 
<A NAME="688"></A>angry fury.  Then they who had spared his life, fearing for their safety, 
<A NAME="689"></A>surrendered to him their flocks and begged only for their lives.  To them 
<A NAME="690"></A>the Panther made this reply:  "I remember alike those who sought my life 
<A NAME="691"></A>with stones, and those who gave me food aside, therefore, your fears. 
<A NAME="692"></A> I return as an enemy only to those who injured me."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="693"></A><B>The Ass and the Charger</B>

<A NAME="694"></A><BR><BR>An Ass congratulated a Horse on being so ungrudgingly and carefully 
<A NAME="695"></A>provided for, while he himself had scarcely enough to eat and not even 
<A NAME="696"></A>that without hard work.  But when war broke out, a heavily armed soldier 
<A NAME="697"></A>mounted the Horse, and riding him to the charge, rushed into the very midst 
<A NAME="698"></A>of the enemy.  The Horse was wounded and fell dead on the battlefield. 
<A NAME="699"></A> Then the Ass, seeing all these things, changed his mind, and commiserated 
<A NAME="700"></A>the Horse.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="701"></A><B>The Eagle and His Captor</B>

<A NAME="702"></A><BR><BR>An Eagle was once captured by a man, who immediately clipped his 
<A NAME="703"></A>wings and put him into his poultry-yard with the other birds, at which 
<A NAME="704"></A>treatment the Eagle was weighed down with grief.  Later, another neighbor 
<A NAME="705"></A>purchased him and allowed his feathers to grow again.  The Eagle took flight, 
<A NAME="706"></A>and pouncing upon a hare, brought it at once as an offering to his benefactor. 
<A NAME="707"></A> A Fox, seeing this, exclaimed, "Do not cultivate the favor of this man, 
<A NAME="708"></A>but of your former owner, lest he should again hunt for you and deprive 
<A NAME="709"></A>you a second time of your wings."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="710"></A><B>The Bald Man and the Fly</B>

<A NAME="711"></A><BR><BR>A Fly bit the bare head of a Bald Man who, endeavoring to destroy 
<A NAME="712"></A>it, gave himself a heavy slap.  Escaping, the Fly said mockingly, "You 
<A NAME="713"></A>who have wished to revenge, even with death, the Prick of a tiny insect, 
<A NAME="714"></A>see what you have done to yourself to add insult to injury?'  The Bald 
<A NAME="715"></A>Man replied, "I can easily make peace with myself, because I know there 
<A NAME="716"></A>was no intention to hurt.  But you, an ill-favored and contemptible insect 
<A NAME="717"></A>who delights in sucking human blood, I wish that I could have killed you 
<A NAME="718"></A>even if I had incurred a heavier penalty."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="719"></A><B>The Olive-Tree and the Fig-Tree</B>

<A NAME="720"></A><BR><BR>The Olive-Tree ridiculed the Fig-Tree because, while she was green 
<A NAME="721"></A>all the year round, the Fig-Tree changed its leaves with the seasons. 
<A NAME="722"></A> A shower of snow fell upon them, and, finding the Olive full of foliage, 
<A NAME="723"></A>it settled upon its branches and broke them down with its weight, at once 
<A NAME="724"></A>despoiling it of its beauty and killing the tree.  But finding the Fig-Tree 
<A NAME="725"></A>denuded of leaves, the snow fell through to the ground, and did not injure 
<A NAME="726"></A>it at all.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="727"></A><B>The Eagle and the Kite</B>

<A NAME="728"></A><BR><BR>An Eagle, overwhelmed with sorrow, sat upon the branches of a tree 
<A NAME="729"></A>in company with a Kite.  "Why," said the Kite, "do I see you with such 
<A NAME="730"></A>a rueful look?'  "I seek," she replied, "a mate suitable for me, and am 
<A NAME="731"></A>not able to find one."  "Take me," returned the Kite, "I am much stronger 
<A NAME="732"></A>than you are."  "Why, are you able to secure the means of living by your 
<A NAME="733"></A>plunder?'  "Well, I have often caught and carried away an ostrich in my 
<A NAME="734"></A>talons."  The Eagle, persuaded by these words, accepted him as her mate. 
<A NAME="735"></A> Shortly after the nuptials, the Eagle said, "Fly off and bring me back 
<A NAME="736"></A>the ostrich you promised me."  The Kite, soaring aloft into the air, brought 
<A NAME="737"></A>back the shabbiest possible mouse, stinking from the length of time it 
<A NAME="738"></A>had lain about the fields.  "Is this," said the Eagle, "the faithful fulfillment 
<A NAME="739"></A>of your promise to me?'  The Kite replied, "That I might attain your royal 
<A NAME="740"></A>hand, there is nothing that I would not have promised, however much I knew 
<A NAME="741"></A>that I must fail in the performance."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="742"></A><B>The Ass and His Driver</B>

<A NAME="743"></A><BR><BR>An Ass, being driven along a high road, suddenly started off and 
<A NAME="744"></A>bolted to the brink of a deep precipice.  While he was in the act of throwing 
<A NAME="745"></A>himself over, his owner seized him by the tail, endeavoring to pull him 
<A NAME="746"></A>back.  When the Ass persisted in his effort, the man let him go and said, 
<A NAME="747"></A>"Conquer, but conquer to your cost."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="748"></A><B>The Thrush and the Fowler</B>

<A NAME="749"></A><BR><BR>A Thrush was feeding on a myrtle-tree and did not move from it 
<A NAME="750"></A>because its berries were so delicious.  A Fowler observed her staying so 
<A NAME="751"></A>long in one spot, and having well bird-limed his reeds, caught her.  The 
<A NAME="752"></A>Thrush, being at the point of death, exclaimed, "O foolish creature that 
<A NAME="753"></A>I am! For the sake of a little pleasant food I have deprived myself of 
<A NAME="754"></A>my life."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="755"></A><B>The Rose and the Amaranth</B>

<A NAME="756"></A><BR><BR>An Amaranth planted in a garden near a Rose-Tree, thus addressed 
<A NAME="757"></A>it:  "What a lovely flower is the Rose, a favorite alike with Gods and 
<A NAME="758"></A>with men.  I envy you your beauty and your perfume."  The Rose replied, 
<A NAME="759"></A>"I indeed, dear Amaranth, flourish but for a brief season! If no cruel 
<A NAME="760"></A>hand pluck me from my stem, yet I must perish by an early doom.  But thou 
<A NAME="761"></A>art immortal and dost never fade, but bloomest for ever in renewed 
<A NAME="762"></A>youth."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="763"></A><B>The Frogs' Complaint Against the Sun</B>

<A NAME="764"></A><BR><BR>Once upon a time, when the Sun announced his intention to take 
<A NAME="765"></A>a wife, the Frogs lifted up their voices in clamor to the sky. Jupiter, 
<A NAME="766"></A>disturbed by the noise of their croaking, inquired the cause of their complaint. 
<A NAME="767"></A> One of them said, "The Sun, now while he is single, parches up the marsh, 
<A NAME="768"></A>and compels us to die miserably in our arid homes.  What will be our future 
<A NAME="769"></A>condition if he should beget other suns?"
