<A NAME="10"></A><B>The Wolf and the Lamb</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Wolf, meeting with a Lamb astray from the fold, resolved not to lay violent 
<A NAME="12"></A>hands on him, but to find some plea to justify to the Lamb the Wolf's right 
<A NAME="13"></A>to eat him.  He thus addressed him: "Sirrah, last year you grossly insulted 
<A NAME="14"></A>me."  "Indeed," bleated the Lamb in a mournful tone of voice, "I was not 
<A NAME="15"></A>then born."  Then said the Wolf, "You feed in my pasture."  "No, good sir," 
<A NAME="16"></A>replied the Lamb, "I have not yet tasted grass."  Again said the Wolf, 
<A NAME="17"></A>"You drink of my well."  "No," exclaimed the Lamb, "I never yet drank water, 
<A NAME="18"></A>for as yet my mother's milk is both food and drink to me."  Upon which 
<A NAME="19"></A>the Wolf seized him and ate him up, saying, "Well! I won't remain supperless, 
<A NAME="20"></A>even though you refute every one of my imputations."  The tyrant will always 
<A NAME="21"></A>find a pretext for his tyranny.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="22"></A><B>The Bat and the Weasels</B>

<A NAME="23"></A><BR><BR>A Bat who fell upon the ground and was caught by a Weasel pleaded 
<A NAME="24"></A>to be spared his life.  The Weasel refused, saying that he was by nature 
<A NAME="25"></A>the enemy of all birds.  The Bat assured him that he was not a bird, but 
<A NAME="26"></A>a mouse, and thus was set free.  Shortly afterwards the Bat again fell 
<A NAME="27"></A>to the ground and was caught by another Weasel, whom he likewise entreated 
<A NAME="28"></A>not to eat him.  The Weasel said that he had a special hostility to mice. 
<A NAME="29"></A> The Bat assured him that he was not a mouse, but a bat, and thus a second 
<A NAME="30"></A>time escaped.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR>It is wise to turn circumstances to good account.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="32"></A><B>The Ass and the Grasshopper</B>

<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR>An Ass having heard some Grasshoppers chirping, was highly enchanted; 
<A NAME="34"></A>and, desiring to possess the same charms of melody, demanded what sort 
<A NAME="35"></A>of food they lived on to give them such beautiful voices.  They replied, 
<A NAME="36"></A>"The dew."  The Ass resolved that he would live only upon dew, and in a 
<A NAME="37"></A>short time died of hunger.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="38"></A><B>The Lion and the Mouse</B>

<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR>A Lion was awakened from sleep by a Mouse running over his face. 
<A NAME="40"></A>Rising up angrily, he caught him and was about to kill him, when the Mouse 
<A NAME="41"></A>piteously entreated, saying:  "If you would only spare my life, I would 
<A NAME="42"></A>be sure to repay your kindness."  The Lion laughed and let him go.  It 
<A NAME="43"></A>happened shortly after this that the Lion was caught by some hunters, who 
<A NAME="44"></A>bound him by ropes to the ground.  The Mouse, recognizing his roar, 
<A NAME="45"></A>came gnawed the rope with his teeth, and set him free, 
<A NAME="46"></A>exclaimed,
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR>"You ridiculed the idea of my ever being able to help you, expecting 
<A NAME="48"></A>to receive from me any repayment of your favor; I now you know that it 
<A NAME="49"></A>is possible for even a Mouse to con benefits on a Lion."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="50"></A><B>The Charcoal-Burner and the Fuller</B>

<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR>A Charcoal-Burner carried on his trade in his own house.  One day 
<A NAME="52"></A>he met a friend, a Fuller, and entreated him to come and live with him, 
<A NAME="53"></A>saying that they should be far better neighbors and that their housekeeping 
<A NAME="54"></A>expenses would be lessened.  The Fuller replied, "The arrangement is impossible 
<A NAME="55"></A>as far as I am concerned, for whatever I should whiten, you would immediately 
<A NAME="56"></A>blacken again with your charcoal."
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR>Like will draw like.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="58"></A><B>The Father and His Sons</B>

<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR>A father had a family of sons who were perpetually quarreling among 
<A NAME="60"></A>themselves.  When he failed to heal their disputes by his exhortations, 
<A NAME="61"></A>he determined to give them a practical illustration of the evils of disunion; 
<A NAME="62"></A>and for this purpose he one day told them to bring him a bundle of sticks. 
<A NAME="63"></A> When they had done so, he placed the faggot into the hands of each of 
<A NAME="64"></A>them in succession, and ordered them to break it in pieces.  They tried 
<A NAME="65"></A>with all their strength, and were not able to do it.  He next opened the 
<A NAME="66"></A>faggot, took the sticks separately, one by one, and again put them into 
<A NAME="67"></A>his sons' hands, upon which they broke them easily.  He then addressed 
<A NAME="68"></A>them in these words:  "My sons, if you are of one mind, and unite to assist 
<A NAME="69"></A>each other, you will be as this faggot, uninjured by all the attempts of 
<A NAME="70"></A>your enemies; but if you are divided among yourselves, you will be broken 
<A NAME="71"></A>as easily as these sticks."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="72"></A><B>The Boy Hunting Locusts</B>

<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>A boy was hunting for locusts.  He had caught a goodly number, 
<A NAME="74"></A>when he saw a Scorpion, and mistaking him for a locust, reached out his 
<A NAME="75"></A>hand to take him.  The Scorpion, showing his sting, said: If you had but 
<A NAME="76"></A>touched me, my friend, you would have lost me, and all your locusts 
<A NAME="77"></A>too!"
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="78"></A><B>The Cock and the Jewel</B>

<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>A Cock, scratching for food for himself and his hens, found a precious 
<A NAME="80"></A>stone and exclaimed:  "If your owner had found thee, and not I, he would 
<A NAME="81"></A>have taken thee up, and have set thee in thy first estate; but I have found 
<A NAME="82"></A>thee for no purpose.  I would rather have one barleycorn than all the jewels 
<A NAME="83"></A>in the world."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="84"></A><B>The Kingdom of the Lion</B>

<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>The beasts of the field and forest had a Lion as their king.  He 
<A NAME="86"></A>was neither wrathful, cruel, nor tyrannical, but just and gentle as a king 
<A NAME="87"></A>could be.  During his reign he made a royal proclamation for a general 
<A NAME="88"></A>assembly of all the birds and beasts, and drew up conditions for a universal 
<A NAME="89"></A>league, in which the Wolf and the Lamb, the Panther and the Kid, the Tiger 
<A NAME="90"></A>and the Stag, the Dog and the Hare, should live together in perfect peace 
<A NAME="91"></A>and amity.  The Hare said, "Oh, how I have longed to see this day, in which 
<A NAME="92"></A>the weak shall take their place with impunity by the side of the strong." 
<A NAME="93"></A> And after the Hare said this, he ran for his life.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="94"></A><B>The Wolf and the Crane</B>

<A NAME="95"></A><BR><BR>A Wolf who had a bone stuck in his throat hired a Crane, for a 
<A NAME="96"></A>large sum, to put her head into his mouth and draw out the bone. When the 
<A NAME="97"></A>Crane had extracted the bone and demanded the promised payment, the Wolf, 
<A NAME="98"></A>grinning and grinding his teeth, exclaimed: "Why, you have surely already 
<A NAME="99"></A>had a sufficient recompense, in having been permitted to draw out your 
<A NAME="100"></A>head in safety from the mouth and jaws of a wolf."
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR>In serving the wicked, expect no reward, and be thankful if you 
<A NAME="102"></A>escape injury for your pains.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="103"></A><B>The Fisherman Piping</B>

<A NAME="104"></A><BR><BR>A fisherman skilled in music took his flute and his nets to the 
<A NAME="105"></A>seashore.  Standing on a projecting rock, he played several tunes in the 
<A NAME="106"></A>hope that the fish, attracted by his melody, would of their own accord 
<A NAME="107"></A>dance into his net, which he had placed below. At last, having long waited 
<A NAME="108"></A>in vain, he laid aside his flute, and casting his net into the sea, made 
<A NAME="109"></A>an excellent haul of fish. When he saw them leaping about in the net upon 
<A NAME="110"></A>the rock he said: "O you most perverse creatures, when I piped you would 
<A NAME="111"></A>not dance, but now that I have ceased you do so merrily."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="112"></A><B>Hercules and the Wagoner</B>

<A NAME="113"></A><BR><BR>A carter was driving a wagon along a country lane, when the wheels 
<A NAME="114"></A>sank down deep into a rut.  The rustic driver, stupefied and aghast, stood 
<A NAME="115"></A>looking at the wagon, and did nothing but utter loud cries to Hercules 
<A NAME="116"></A>to come and help him.  Hercules, it is said, appeared and thus addressed 
<A NAME="117"></A>him:  "Put your shoulders to the wheels, my man.  Goad on your bullocks, 
<A NAME="118"></A>and never more pray to me for help, until you have done your best to help 
<A NAME="119"></A>yourself, or depend upon it you will henceforth pray in 
<A NAME="120"></A>vain."
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR>Self-help is the best help.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="122"></A><B>The Ants and the Grasshopper</B>

<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>The ants were spending a fine winter's day drying grain collected 
<A NAME="124"></A>in the summertime.  A Grasshopper, perishing with famine, passed by and 
<A NAME="125"></A>earnestly begged for a little food.  The Ants inquired of him, "Why did 
<A NAME="126"></A>you not treasure up food during the summer?'  He replied, "I had not leisure 
<A NAME="127"></A>enough.  I passed the days in singing."  They then said in derision:  "If 
<A NAME="128"></A>you were foolish enough to sing all the summer, you must dance supperless 
<A NAME="129"></A>to bed in the winter."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="130"></A><B>The Traveler and His Dog</B>

<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR>A traveler about to set out on a journey saw his Dog stand at the 
<A NAME="132"></A>door stretching himself.  He asked him sharply:  "Why do you stand there 
<A NAME="133"></A>gaping? Everything is ready but you, so come with me instantly."  The Dog, 
<A NAME="134"></A>wagging his tail, replied:  "O, master! I am quite ready; it is you for 
<A NAME="135"></A>whom I am waiting."
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>The loiterer often blames delay on his more active 
<A NAME="137"></A>friend.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="138"></A><B>The Dog and the Shadow</B>

<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR>A Dog, crossing a bridge over a stream with a piece of flesh in 
<A NAME="140"></A>his mouth, saw his own shadow in the water and took it for that of another 
<A NAME="141"></A>Dog, with a piece of meat double his own in size.  He immediately let go 
<A NAME="142"></A>of his own, and fiercely attacked the other Dog to get his larger piece 
<A NAME="143"></A>from him.  He thus lost both:  that which he grasped at in the water, because 
<A NAME="144"></A>it was a shadow; and his own, because the stream swept it 
<A NAME="145"></A>away.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="146"></A><B>The Mole and His Mother</B>

<A NAME="147"></A><BR><BR>A Mole, a creature blind from birth, once said to his Mother: 
<A NAME="148"></A> "I am sure than I can see, Mother!"  In the desire to prove to him his 
<A NAME="149"></A>mistake, his Mother placed before him a few grains of frankincense, and 
<A NAME="150"></A>asked, "What is it?'  The young Mole said, "It is a pebble."  His Mother 
<A NAME="151"></A>exclaimed:  "My son, I am afraid that you are not only blind, but that 
<A NAME="152"></A>you have lost your sense of smell.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="153"></A><B>The Herdsman and the Lost Bull</B>

<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR>A herdsman tending his flock in a forest lost a Bull-calf from 
<A NAME="155"></A>the fold.  After a long and fruitless search, he made a vow that, if he 
<A NAME="156"></A>could only discover the thief who had stolen the Calf, he would offer a 
<A NAME="157"></A>lamb in sacrifice to Hermes, Pan, and the Guardian Deities of the forest. 
<A NAME="158"></A> Not long afterwards, as he ascended a small hillock, he saw at its foot 
<A NAME="159"></A>a Lion feeding on the Calf. Terrified at the sight, he lifted his eyes 
<A NAME="160"></A>and his hands to heaven, and said:  "Just now I vowed to offer a lamb to 
<A NAME="161"></A>the Guardian Deities of the forest if I could only find out who had robbed 
<A NAME="162"></A>me; but now that I have discovered the thief, I would willingly add a full-grown 
<A NAME="163"></A>Bull to the Calf I have lost, if I may only secure my own escape from him 
<A NAME="164"></A>in safety."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="165"></A><B>The Hare and the Tortoise</B>

<A NAME="166"></A><BR><BR>A Hare one day ridiculed the short feet and slow pace of the Tortoise, 
<A NAME="167"></A>who replied, laughing:  "Though you be swift as the wind, I will beat you 
<A NAME="168"></A>in a race."  The Hare, believing her assertion to be simply impossible, 
<A NAME="169"></A>assented to the proposal; and they agreed that the Fox should choose the 
<A NAME="170"></A>course and fix the goal.  On the day appointed for the race the two started 
<A NAME="171"></A>together.  The Tortoise never for a moment stopped, but went on with a 
<A NAME="172"></A>slow but steady pace straight to the end of the course. The Hare, lying 
<A NAME="173"></A>down by the wayside, fell fast asleep.  At last waking up, and moving as 
<A NAME="174"></A>fast as he could, he saw the Tortoise had reached the goal, and was comfortably 
<A NAME="175"></A>dozing after her fatigue.
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR>Slow but steady wins the race.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="177"></A><B>The Pomegranate, Apple-Tree, and Bramble</B>

<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR>The Pomegranate and Apple-Tree disputed as to which was the most 
<A NAME="179"></A>beautiful.  When their strife was at its height, a Bramble from the neighboring 
<A NAME="180"></A>hedge lifted up its voice, and said in a boastful tone:  "Pray, my dear 
<A NAME="181"></A>friends, in my presence at least cease from such vain 
<A NAME="182"></A>disputings."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="183"></A><B>The Farmer and the Stork</B>

<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR>A Farmer placed nets on his newly-sown plowlands and caught a number 
<A NAME="185"></A>of Cranes, which came to pick up his seed.  With them he trapped a Stork 
<A NAME="186"></A>that had fractured his leg in the net and was earnestly beseeching the 
<A NAME="187"></A>Farmer to spare his life.  "Pray save me, Master," he said, "and let me 
<A NAME="188"></A>go free this once.  My broken limb should excite your pity.  Besides, I 
<A NAME="189"></A>am no Crane, I am a Stork, a bird of excellent character; and see how I 
<A NAME="190"></A>love and slave for my father and mother.  Look too, at my feathers-- they 
<A NAME="191"></A>are not the least like those of a Crane."   The Farmer laughed aloud and 
<A NAME="192"></A>said, "It may be all as you say, I only know this:  I have taken you with 
<A NAME="193"></A>these robbers, the Cranes, and you must die in their 
<A NAME="194"></A>company."
<A NAME="195"></A><BR><BR>Birds of a feather flock together.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="196"></A><B>The Farmer and the Snake</B>

<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>One winter a Farmer found a Snake stiff and frozen with cold. 
<A NAME="198"></A> He had compassion on it, and taking it up, placed it in his bosom. The 
<A NAME="199"></A>Snake was quickly revived by the warmth, and resuming its natural instincts, 
<A NAME="200"></A>bit its benefactor, inflicting on him a mortal wound.  "Oh," cried the 
<A NAME="201"></A>Farmer with his last breath, "I am rightly served for pitying a 
<A NAME="202"></A>scoundrel."
<A NAME="203"></A><BR><BR>The greatest kindness will not bind the ungrateful.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="204"></A><B>The Fawn and His Mother</B>

<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR>A young fawn once said to his Mother, "You are larger than a dog, 
<A NAME="206"></A>and swifter, and more used to running, and you have your horns as a defense; 
<A NAME="207"></A>why, then, O Mother! do the hounds frighten you so?" She smiled, and said: 
<A NAME="208"></A> "I know full well, my son, that all you say is true.  I have the advantages 
<A NAME="209"></A>you mention, but when I hear even the bark of a single dog I feel ready 
<A NAME="210"></A>to faint, and fly away as fast as I can."
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR>No arguments will give courage to the coward.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="212"></A><B>The Bear and the Fox</B>

<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR>A Bear boasted very much of his philanthropy, saying that of all 
<A NAME="214"></A>animals he was the most tender in his regard for man, for he had such respect 
<A NAME="215"></A>for him that he would not even touch his dead body. A Fox hearing these 
<A NAME="216"></A>words said with a smile to the Bear, "Oh! that you would eat the dead and 
<A NAME="217"></A>not the living."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="218"></A><B>The Swallow and the Crow</B>

<A NAME="219"></A><BR><BR>The Swallow and the Crow had a contention about their plumage. 
<A NAME="220"></A>The Crow put an end to the dispute by saying, "Your feathers are all very 
<A NAME="221"></A>well in the spring, but mine protect me against the 
<A NAME="222"></A>winter."
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR>Fair weather friends are not worth much.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="224"></A><B>The Mountain in Labor</B>

<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR>A Mountain was once greatly agitated.  Loud groans and noises were 
<A NAME="226"></A>heard, and crowds of people came from all parts to see what was the matter. 
<A NAME="227"></A> While they were assembled in anxious expectation of some terrible calamity, 
<A NAME="228"></A>out came a Mouse.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR><BR>Don't make much ado about nothing.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="230"></A><B>The Ass, the Fox, and the Lion</B>

<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR>The Ass and the Fox, having entered into partnership together for 
<A NAME="232"></A>their mutual protection, went out into the forest to hunt.  They had not 
<A NAME="233"></A>proceeded far when they met a Lion.  The Fox, seeing imminent danger, approached 
<A NAME="234"></A>the Lion and promised to contrive for him the capture of the Ass if the 
<A NAME="235"></A>Lion would pledge his word not to harm the Fox.  Then, upon assuring the 
<A NAME="236"></A>Ass that he would not be injured, the Fox led him to a deep pit and arranged 
<A NAME="237"></A>that he should fall into it.  The Lion, seeing that the Ass was secured, 
<A NAME="238"></A>immediately clutched the Fox, and attacked the Ass at his 
<A NAME="239"></A>leisure.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="240"></A><B>The Tortoise and the Eagle</B>

<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR>A Tortoise, lazily basking in the sun, complained to the sea-birds 
<A NAME="242"></A>of her hard fate, that no one would teach her to fly. An Eagle, hovering 
<A NAME="243"></A>near, heard her lamentation and demanded what reward she would give him 
<A NAME="244"></A>if he would take her aloft and float her in the air.  "I will give you," 
<A NAME="245"></A>she said, "all the riches of the Red Sea."  "I will teach you to fly then," 
<A NAME="246"></A>said the Eagle; and taking her up in his talons he carried her almost to 
<A NAME="247"></A>the clouds suddenly he let her go, and she fell on a lofty mountain, dashing 
<A NAME="248"></A>her shell to pieces.  The Tortoise exclaimed in the moment of death:  "I 
<A NAME="249"></A>have deserved my present fate; for what had I to do with wings and clouds, 
<A NAME="250"></A>who can with difficulty move about on the earth?'
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR>If men had all they wished, they would be often 
<A NAME="252"></A>ruined.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="253"></A><B>The Flies and the Honey-Pot</B>

<A NAME="254"></A><BR><BR>A number of Flies were attracted to a jar of honey which had been 
<A NAME="255"></A>overturned in a housekeeper's room, and placing their feet in it, ate greedily. 
<A NAME="256"></A> Their feet, however, became so smeared with the honey that they could 
<A NAME="257"></A>not use their wings, nor release themselves, and were suffocated.  Just 
<A NAME="258"></A>as they were expiring, they exclaimed, "O foolish creatures that we are, 
<A NAME="259"></A>for the sake of a little pleasure we have destroyed 
<A NAME="260"></A>ourselves."
<A NAME="261"></A><BR><BR>Pleasure bought with pains, hurts.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="262"></A><B>The Man and the Lion</B>

<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR>A Man and a Lion traveled together through the forest.  They soon 
<A NAME="264"></A>began to boast of their respective superiority to each other in strength 
<A NAME="265"></A>and prowess.  As they were disputing, they passed a statue carved in stone, 
<A NAME="266"></A>which represented "a Lion strangled by a Man."  The traveler pointed to 
<A NAME="267"></A>it and said:  "See there! How strong we are, and how we prevail over even 
<A NAME="268"></A>the king of beasts."  The Lion replied:  "This statue was made by one of 
<A NAME="269"></A>you men.  If we Lions knew how to erect statues, you would see the Man 
<A NAME="270"></A>placed under the paw of the Lion."
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>One story is good, till another is told.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="272"></A><B>The Farmer and the Cranes</B>

<A NAME="273"></A><BR><BR>Some cranes made their feeding grounds on some plowlands newly 
<A NAME="274"></A>sown with wheat.  For a long time the Farmer, brandishing an empty sling, 
<A NAME="275"></A>chased them away by the terror he inspired; but when the birds found that 
<A NAME="276"></A>the sling was only swung in the air, they ceased to take any notice of 
<A NAME="277"></A>it and would not move.  The Farmer, on seeing this, charged his sling with 
<A NAME="278"></A>stones, and killed a great number.  The remaining birds at once forsook 
<A NAME="279"></A>his fields, crying to each other, "It is time for us to be off to Liliput: 
<A NAME="280"></A> for this man is no longer content to scare us, but begins to show us in 
<A NAME="281"></A>earnest what he can do."
<A NAME="282"></A><BR><BR>If words suffice not, blows must follow.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="283"></A><B>The Dog in the Manger</B>

<A NAME="284"></A><BR><BR>A Dog lay in a manger, and by his growling and snapping prevented 
<A NAME="285"></A>the oxen from eating the hay which had been placed for them. "What a selfish 
<A NAME="286"></A>Dog!"  said one of them to his companions; "he cannot eat the hay himself, 
<A NAME="287"></A>and yet refuses to allow those to eat who can."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="288"></A><B>The Fox and the Goat</B>

<A NAME="289"></A><BR><BR>A Fox one day fell into a deep well and could find no means of 
<A NAME="290"></A>escape.  A Goat, overcome with thirst, came to the same well, and seeing 
<A NAME="291"></A>the Fox, inquired if the water was good.  Concealing his sad plight under 
<A NAME="292"></A>a merry guise, the Fox indulged in a lavish praise of the water, saying 
<A NAME="293"></A>it was excellent beyond measure, and encouraging him to descend.  The Goat, 
<A NAME="294"></A>mindful only of his thirst, thoughtlessly jumped down, but just as he drank, 
<A NAME="295"></A>the Fox informed him of the difficulty they were both in and suggested 
<A NAME="296"></A>a scheme for their common escape.  "If," said he, "you will place your 
<A NAME="297"></A>forefeet upon the wall and bend your head, I will run up your back and 
<A NAME="298"></A>escape, and will help you out afterwards."  The Goat readily assented and 
<A NAME="299"></A>the Fox leaped upon his back.  Steadying himself with the Goat's horns, 
<A NAME="300"></A>he safely reached the mouth of the well and made off as fast as he could. 
<A NAME="301"></A> When the Goat upbraided him for breaking his promise, he turned around 
<A NAME="302"></A>and cried out, "You foolish old fellow! If you had as many brains in your 
<A NAME="303"></A>head as you have hairs in your beard, you would never have gone down before 
<A NAME="304"></A>you had inspected the way up, nor have exposed yourself to dangers from 
<A NAME="305"></A>which you had no means of escape."
<A NAME="306"></A><BR><BR>Look before you leap.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="307"></A><B>The Bear and the Two Travelers</B>

<A NAME="308"></A><BR><BR>Two men were traveling together, when a Bear suddenly met them 
<A NAME="309"></A>on their path.  One of them climbed up quickly into a tree and concealed 
<A NAME="310"></A>himself in the branches.  The other, seeing that he must be attacked, fell 
<A NAME="311"></A>flat on the ground, and when the Bear came up and felt him with his snout, 
<A NAME="312"></A>and smelt him all over, he held his breath, and feigned the appearance 
<A NAME="313"></A>of death as much as he could.  The Bear soon left him, for it is said he 
<A NAME="314"></A>will not touch a dead body.  When he was quite gone, the other Traveler 
<A NAME="315"></A>descended from the tree, and jocularly inquired of his friend what it was 
<A NAME="316"></A>the Bear had whispered in his ear.  "He gave me this advice," his companion 
<A NAME="317"></A>replied.  "Never travel with a friend who deserts you at the approach of 
<A NAME="318"></A>danger."
<A NAME="319"></A><BR><BR>Misfortune tests the sincerity of friends.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="320"></A><B>The Oxen and the Axle-Trees</B>

<A NAME="321"></A><BR><BR>A heavy wagon was being dragged along a country lane by a team 
<A NAME="322"></A>of Oxen.  The Axle-trees groaned and creaked terribly; whereupon the Oxen, 
<A NAME="323"></A>turning round, thus addressed the wheels:  "Hullo there! why do you make 
<A NAME="324"></A>so much noise? We bear all the labor, and we, not you, ought to cry 
<A NAME="325"></A>out."
<A NAME="326"></A><BR><BR>Those who suffer most cry out the least.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="327"></A><B>The Thirsty Pigeon</B>

<A NAME="328"></A><BR><BR>A Pigeon, oppressed by excessive thirst, saw a goblet of water 
<A NAME="329"></A>painted on a signboard.  Not supposing it to be only a picture, she flew 
<A NAME="330"></A>towards it with a loud whir and unwittingly dashed against the signboard, 
<A NAME="331"></A>jarring herself terribly.  Having broken her wings by the blow, she fell 
<A NAME="332"></A>to the ground, and was caught by one of the bystanders.
<A NAME="333"></A><BR><BR>Zeal should not outrun discretion.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="334"></A><B>The Raven and the Swan</B>

<A NAME="335"></A><BR><BR>A Raven saw a Swan and desired to secure for himself the same beautiful 
<A NAME="336"></A>plumage.  Supposing that the Swan's splendid white color arose from his 
<A NAME="337"></A>washing in the water in which he swam, the Raven left the altars in the 
<A NAME="338"></A>neighborhood where he picked up his living, and took up residence in the 
<A NAME="339"></A>lakes and pools.  But cleansing his feathers as often as he would, he could 
<A NAME="340"></A>not change their color, while through want of food he 
<A NAME="341"></A>perished.
<A NAME="342"></A><BR><BR>Change of habit cannot alter Nature.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="343"></A><B>The Goat and the Goatherd</B>

<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR>A Goatherd had sought to bring back a stray goat to his flock. 
<A NAME="345"></A>He whistled and sounded his horn in vain; the straggler paid no attention 
<A NAME="346"></A>to the summons.  At last the Goatherd threw a stone, and breaking its horn, 
<A NAME="347"></A>begged the Goat not to tell his master. The Goat replied, "Why, you silly 
<A NAME="348"></A>fellow, the horn will speak though I be silent."
<A NAME="349"></A><BR><BR>Do not attempt to hide things which cannot be 
<A NAME="350"></A>hid.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="351"></A><B>The Miser</B>

<A NAME="352"></A><BR><BR>A Miser sold all that he had and bought a lump of gold, which he 
<A NAME="353"></A>buried in a hole in the ground by the side of an old wall and went to look 
<A NAME="354"></A>at daily.  One of his workmen observed his frequent visits to the spot 
<A NAME="355"></A>and decided to watch his movements.  He soon discovered the secret of the 
<A NAME="356"></A>hidden treasure, and digging down, came to the lump of gold, and stole 
<A NAME="357"></A>it.  The Miser, on his next visit, found the hole empty and began to tear 
<A NAME="358"></A>his hair and to make loud lamentations.  A neighbor, seeing him overcome 
<A NAME="359"></A>with grief and learning the cause, said, "Pray do not grieve so; but go 
<A NAME="360"></A>and take a stone, and place it in the hole, and fancy that the gold is 
<A NAME="361"></A>still lying there.  It will do you quite the same service; for when the 
<A NAME="362"></A>gold was there, you had it not, as you did not make the slightest use of 
<A NAME="363"></A>it."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="364"></A><B>The Sick Lion</B>

<A NAME="365"></A><BR><BR>A Lion, unable from old age and infirmities to provide himself 
<A NAME="366"></A>with food by force, resolved to do so by artifice.  He returned to his 
<A NAME="367"></A>den, and lying down there, pretended to be sick, taking care that his sickness 
<A NAME="368"></A>should be publicly known.  The beasts expressed their sorrow, and came 
<A NAME="369"></A>one by one to his den, where the Lion devoured them.  After many of the 
<A NAME="370"></A>beasts had thus disappeared, the Fox discovered the trick and presenting 
<A NAME="371"></A>himself to the Lion, stood on the outside of the cave, at a respectful 
<A NAME="372"></A>distance, and asked him how he was.  "I am very middling," replied the 
<A NAME="373"></A>Lion, "but why do you stand without? Pray enter within to talk with me." 
<A NAME="374"></A> "No, thank you," said the Fox.  "I notice that there are many prints of 
<A NAME="375"></A>feet entering your cave, but I see no trace of any returning."
<A NAME="376"></A><BR><BR>He is wise who is warned by the misfortunes of 
<A NAME="377"></A>others.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="378"></A><B>The Horse and Groom</B>

<A NAME="379"></A><BR><BR>A Groom used to spend whole days in currycombing and rubbing down 
<A NAME="380"></A>his Horse, but at the same time stole his oats and sold them for his own 
<A NAME="381"></A>profit.  "Alas!"  said the Horse, "if you really wish me to be in good 
<A NAME="382"></A>condition, you should groom me less, and feed me more."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="383"></A><B>The Ass and the Lapdog</B>

<A NAME="384"></A><BR><BR>A Man had an Ass, and a Maltese Lapdog, a very great beauty.  The 
<A NAME="385"></A>Ass was left in a stable and had plenty of oats and hay to eat, just as 
<A NAME="386"></A>any other Ass would.  The Lapdog knew many tricks and was a great favorite 
<A NAME="387"></A>with his master, who often fondled him and seldom went out to dine without 
<A NAME="388"></A>bringing him home some tidbit to eat.  The Ass, on the contrary, had much 
<A NAME="389"></A>work to do in grinding the corn-mill and in carrying wood from the forest 
<A NAME="390"></A>or burdens from the farm.  He often lamented his own hard fate and contrasted 
<A NAME="391"></A>it with the luxury and idleness of the Lapdog, till at last one day he 
<A NAME="392"></A>broke his cords and halter, and galloped into his master's house, kicking 
<A NAME="393"></A>up his heels without measure, and frisking and fawning as well as he could. 
<A NAME="394"></A> He next tried to jump about his master as he had seen the Lapdog do, but 
<A NAME="395"></A>he broke the table and smashed all the dishes upon it to atoms.  He then 
<A NAME="396"></A>attempted to lick his master, and jumped upon his back.  The servants, 
<A NAME="397"></A>hearing the strange hubbub and perceiving the danger of their master, quickly 
<A NAME="398"></A>relieved him, and drove out the Ass to his stable with kicks and clubs 
<A NAME="399"></A>and cuffs.  The Ass, as he returned to his stall beaten nearly to death, 
<A NAME="400"></A>thus lamented:  "I have brought it all on myself! Why could I not have 
<A NAME="401"></A>been contented to labor with my companions, and not wish to be idle all 
<A NAME="402"></A>the day like that useless little Lapdog!"
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="403"></A><B>The Lioness</B>

<A NAME="404"></A><BR><BR>A controversy prevailed among the beasts of the field as to which 
<A NAME="405"></A>of the animals deserved the most credit for producing the greatest number 
<A NAME="406"></A>of whelps at a birth.  They rushed clamorously into the presence of the 
<A NAME="407"></A>Lioness and demanded of her the settlement of the dispute.  "And you," 
<A NAME="408"></A>they said, "how many sons have you at a birth?'  The Lioness laughed at 
<A NAME="409"></A>them, and said: "Why! I have only one; but that one is altogether a thoroughbred 
<A NAME="410"></A>Lion."
<A NAME="411"></A><BR><BR>The value is in the worth, not in the number.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="412"></A><B>The Boasting Traveler</B>

<A NAME="413"></A><BR><BR>A Man who had traveled in foreign lands boasted very much, on returning 
<A NAME="414"></A>to his own country, of the many wonderful and heroic feats he had performed 
<A NAME="415"></A>in the different places he had visited. Among other things, he said that 
<A NAME="416"></A>when he was at Rhodes he had leaped to such a distance that no man of his 
<A NAME="417"></A>day could leap anywhere near him as to that, there were in Rhodes many 
<A NAME="418"></A>persons who saw him do it and whom he could call as witnesses.  One of 
<A NAME="419"></A>the bystanders interrupted him, saying:  "Now, my good man, if this be 
<A NAME="420"></A>all true there is no need of witnesses.  Suppose this to be Rhodes, and 
<A NAME="421"></A>leap for us."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="422"></A><B>The Cat and the Cock</B>

<A NAME="423"></A><BR><BR>A Cat caught a Cock, and pondered how he might find a reasonable 
<A NAME="424"></A>excuse for eating him.  He accused him of being a nuisance to men by crowing 
<A NAME="425"></A>in the nighttime and not permitting them to sleep. The Cock defended himself 
<A NAME="426"></A>by saying that he did this for the benefit of men, that they might rise 
<A NAME="427"></A>in time for their labors. The Cat replied, "Although you abound in specious 
<A NAME="428"></A>apologies, I shall not remain supperless"; and he made a meal of 
<A NAME="429"></A>him.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="430"></A><B>The Piglet, the Sheep, and the Goat</B>

<A NAME="431"></A><BR><BR>A young Pig was shut up in a fold-yard with a Goat and a Sheep. 
<A NAME="432"></A>On one occasion when the shepherd laid hold of him, he grunted and squeaked 
<A NAME="433"></A>and resisted violently.  The Sheep and the Goat complained of his distressing 
<A NAME="434"></A>cries, saying, "He often handles us, and we do not cry out."  To this the 
<A NAME="435"></A>Pig replied, "Your handling and mine are very different things.  He catches 
<A NAME="436"></A>you only for your wool, or your milk, but he lays hold on me for my very 
<A NAME="437"></A>life."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="438"></A><B>The Boy and the Filberts</B>

<A NAME="439"></A><BR><BR>A Boy put his hand into a pitcher full of filberts.  He grasped 
<A NAME="440"></A>as many as he could possibly hold, but when he tried to pull out his hand, 
<A NAME="441"></A>he was prevented from doing so by the neck of the pitcher.  Unwilling to 
<A NAME="442"></A>lose his filberts, and yet unable to withdraw his hand, he burst into tears 
<A NAME="443"></A>and bitterly lamented his disappointment.  A bystander said to him, "Be 
<A NAME="444"></A>satisfied with half the quantity, and you will readily draw out your 
<A NAME="445"></A>hand."
<A NAME="446"></A><BR><BR>Do not attempt too much at once.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="447"></A><B>The Lion in Love</B>

<A NAME="448"></A><BR><BR>A Lion demanded the daughter of a woodcutter in marriage.  The 
<A NAME="449"></A>Father, unwilling to grant, and yet afraid to refuse his request, hit upon 
<A NAME="450"></A>this expedient to rid himself of his importunities.  He expressed his willingness 
<A NAME="451"></A>to accept the Lion as the suitor of his daughter on one condition:  that 
<A NAME="452"></A>he should allow him to extract his teeth, and cut off his claws, as his 
<A NAME="453"></A>daughter was fearfully afraid of both.  The Lion cheerfully assented to 
<A NAME="454"></A>the proposal. But when the toothless, clawless Lion returned to repeat 
<A NAME="455"></A>his request, the Woodman, no longer afraid, set upon him with his club, 
<A NAME="456"></A>and drove him away into the forest.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="457"></A><B>The Laborer and the Snake</B>

<A NAME="458"></A><BR><BR>A Snake, having made his hole close to the porch of a cottage, 
<A NAME="459"></A>inflicted a mortal bite on the Cottager's infant son.  Grieving over his 
<A NAME="460"></A>loss, the Father resolved to kill the Snake.  The next day, when it came 
<A NAME="461"></A>out of its hole for food, he took up his axe, but by swinging too hastily, 
<A NAME="462"></A>missed its head and cut off only the end of its tail.  After some time 
<A NAME="463"></A>the Cottager, afraid that the Snake would bite him also, endeavored to 
<A NAME="464"></A>make peace, and placed some bread and salt in the hole.  The Snake, slightly 
<A NAME="465"></A>hissing, said:  "There can henceforth be no peace between us; for whenever 
<A NAME="466"></A>I see you I shall remember the loss of my tail, and whenever you see me 
<A NAME="467"></A>you will be thinking of the death of your son."
<A NAME="468"></A><BR><BR>No one truly forgets injuries in the presence of him who caused 
<A NAME="469"></A>the injury.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="470"></A><B>The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing</B>

<A NAME="471"></A><BR><BR>Once upon a time a Wolf resolved to disguise his appearance in 
<A NAME="472"></A>order to secure food more easily.  Encased in the skin of a sheep, he pastured 
<A NAME="473"></A>with the flock deceiving the shepherd by his costume.  In the evening he 
<A NAME="474"></A>was shut up by the shepherd in the fold; the gate was closed, and the entrance 
<A NAME="475"></A>made thoroughly secure.  But the shepherd, returning to the fold during 
<A NAME="476"></A>the night to obtain meat for the next day, mistakenly caught up the Wolf 
<A NAME="477"></A>instead of a sheep, and killed him instantly.
<A NAME="478"></A><BR><BR>Harm seek. Harm find.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="479"></A><B>The Ass and the Mule</B>

<A NAME="480"></A><BR><BR>A Muleteer set forth on a journey, driving before him an Ass and 
<A NAME="481"></A>a Mule, both well laden.  The Ass, as long as he traveled along the plain, 
<A NAME="482"></A>carried his load with ease, but when he began to ascend the steep path 
<A NAME="483"></A>of the mountain, felt his load to be more than he could bear.  He entreated 
<A NAME="484"></A>his companion to relieve him of a small portion, that he might carry home 
<A NAME="485"></A>the rest; but the Mule paid no attention to the request.  The Ass shortly 
<A NAME="486"></A>afterwards fell down dead under his burden.  Not knowing what else to do 
<A NAME="487"></A>in so wild a region, the Muleteer placed upon the Mule the load carried 
<A NAME="488"></A>by the Ass in addition to his own, and at the top of all placed the hide 
<A NAME="489"></A>of the Ass, after he had skinned him.  The Mule, groaning beneath his heavy 
<A NAME="490"></A>burden, said to himself:  "I am treated according to my deserts.  If I 
<A NAME="491"></A>had only been willing to assist the Ass a little in his need, I should 
<A NAME="492"></A>not now be bearing, together with his burden, himself as 
<A NAME="493"></A>well."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="494"></A><B>The Frogs Asking for a King</B>

<A NAME="495"></A><BR><BR>The Frogs, grieved at having no established Ruler, sent ambassadors 
<A NAME="496"></A>to Jupiter entreating for a King.  Perceiving their simplicity, he cast 
<A NAME="497"></A>down a huge log into the lake.  The Frogs were terrified at the splash 
<A NAME="498"></A>occasioned by its fall and hid themselves in the depths of the pool.  But 
<A NAME="499"></A>as soon as they realized that the huge log was motionless, they swam again 
<A NAME="500"></A>to the top of the water, dismissed their fears, climbed up, and began squatting 
<A NAME="501"></A>on it in contempt.  After some time they began to think themselves ill-treated 
<A NAME="502"></A>in the appointment of so inert a Ruler, and sent a second deputation to 
<A NAME="503"></A>Jupiter to pray that he would set over them another sovereign.  He then 
<A NAME="504"></A>gave them an Eel to govern them.  When the Frogs discovered his easy good 
<A NAME="505"></A>nature, they sent yet a third time to Jupiter to beg him to choose for 
<A NAME="506"></A>them still another King.  Jupiter, displeased with all their complaints, 
<A NAME="507"></A>sent a Heron, who preyed upon the Frogs day by day till there were none 
<A NAME="508"></A>left to croak upon the lake.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="509"></A><B>The Boys and the Frogs</B>

<A NAME="510"></A><BR><BR>Some boys, playing near a pond, saw a number of Frogs in the water 
<A NAME="511"></A>and began to pelt them with stones.  They killed several of them, when 
<A NAME="512"></A>one of the Frogs, lifting his head out of the water, cried out:  "Pray 
<A NAME="513"></A>stop, my boys:  what is sport to you, is death to us."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="514"></A><B>The Sick Stag</B>

<A NAME="515"></A><BR><BR>A sick stag lay down in a quiet corner of its pasture-ground. His 
<A NAME="516"></A>companions came in great numbers to inquire after his health, and each 
<A NAME="517"></A>one helped himself to a share of the food which had been placed for his 
<A NAME="518"></A>use; so that he died, not from his sickness, but from the failure of the 
<A NAME="519"></A>means of living.
<A NAME="520"></A><BR><BR>Evil companions bring more hurt than profit.

<A NAME="521"></A><B>The Salt Merchant and His Ass</B>

<A NAME="522"></A><BR><BR>A Peddler drove his Ass to the seashore to buy salt.  His road 
<A NAME="523"></A>home lay across a stream into which his Ass, making a false step, fell 
<A NAME="524"></A>by accident and rose up again with his load considerably lighter, as the 
<A NAME="525"></A>water melted the sack.  The Peddler retraced his steps and refilled his 
<A NAME="526"></A>panniers with a larger quantity of salt than before.  When he came again 
<A NAME="527"></A>to the stream, the Ass fell down on purpose in the same spot, and, regaining 
<A NAME="528"></A>his feet with the weight of his load much diminished, brayed triumphantly 
<A NAME="529"></A>as if he had obtained what he desired.  The Peddler saw through his trick 
<A NAME="530"></A>and drove him for the third time to the coast, where he bought a cargo 
<A NAME="531"></A>of sponges instead of salt.  The Ass, again playing the fool, fell down 
<A NAME="532"></A>on purpose when he reached the stream, but the sponges became swollen with 
<A NAME="533"></A>water, greatly increasing his load. And thus his trick recoiled on him, 
<A NAME="534"></A>for he now carried on his back a double burden.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="535"></A><B>The Oxen and the Butchers</B>

<A NAME="536"></A><BR><BR>The Oxen once upon a time sought to destroy the Butchers, who practiced 
<A NAME="537"></A>a trade destructive to their race.  They assembled on a certain day to 
<A NAME="538"></A>carry out their purpose, and sharpened their horns for the contest.  But 
<A NAME="539"></A>one of them who was exceedingly old (for many a field had he plowed) thus 
<A NAME="540"></A>spoke:  "These Butchers, it is true, slaughter us, but they do so with 
<A NAME="541"></A>skillful hands, and with no unnecessary pain.  If we get rid of them, we 
<A NAME="542"></A>shall fall into the hands of unskillful operators, and thus suffer a double 
<A NAME="543"></A>death:  for you may be assured, that though all the Butchers should perish, 
<A NAME="544"></A>yet will men never want beef."
<A NAME="545"></A><BR><BR>Do not be in a hurry to change one evil for 
<A NAME="546"></A>another.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="547"></A><B>The Lion, the Mouse, and the Fox</B>

<A NAME="548"></A><BR><BR>A Lion, fatigued by the heat of a summer's day, fell fast asleep 
<A NAME="549"></A>in his den.  A Mouse ran over his mane and ears and woke him from his slumbers. 
<A NAME="550"></A> He rose up and shook himself in great wrath, and searched every corner 
<A NAME="551"></A>of his den to find the Mouse.  A Fox seeing him said:  "A fine Lion you 
<A NAME="552"></A>are, to be frightened of a Mouse." "'Tis not the Mouse I fear," said the 
<A NAME="553"></A>Lion; "I resent his familiarity and ill-breeding."
<A NAME="554"></A><BR><BR>Little liberties are great offenses.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="555"></A><B>The Vain Jackdaw</B>

<A NAME="556"></A><BR><BR>Jupiter determined, it is said, to create a sovereign over the 
<A NAME="557"></A>birds, and made proclamation that on a certain day they should all present 
<A NAME="558"></A>themselves before him, when he would himself choose the most beautiful 
<A NAME="559"></A>among them to be king.  The Jackdaw, knowing his own ugliness, searched 
<A NAME="560"></A>through the woods and fields, and collected the feathers which had fallen 
<A NAME="561"></A>from the wings of his companions, and stuck them in all parts of his body, 
<A NAME="562"></A>hoping thereby to make himself the most beautiful of all.  When the appointed 
<A NAME="563"></A>day arrived, and the birds had assembled before Jupiter, the Jackdaw also 
<A NAME="564"></A>made his appearance in his many feathered finery.  But when Jupiter proposed 
<A NAME="565"></A>to make him king because of the beauty of his plumage, the birds indignantly 
<A NAME="566"></A>protested, and each plucked from him his own feathers, leaving the Jackdaw 
<A NAME="567"></A>nothing but a Jackdaw.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="568"></A><B>The Goatherd and the Wild Goats</B>

<A NAME="569"></A><BR><BR>A Goatherd, driving his flock from their pasture at eventide, found 
<A NAME="570"></A>some Wild Goats mingled among them, and shut them up together with his 
<A NAME="571"></A>own for the night.  The next day it snowed very hard, so that he could 
<A NAME="572"></A>not take the herd to their usual feeding places, but was obliged to keep 
<A NAME="573"></A>them in the fold.  He gave his own goats just sufficient food to keep them 
<A NAME="574"></A>alive, but fed the strangers more abundantly in the hope of enticing them 
<A NAME="575"></A>to stay with him and of making them his own.  When the thaw set in, he 
<A NAME="576"></A>led them all out to feed, and the Wild Goats scampered away as fast as 
<A NAME="577"></A>they could to the mountains.  The Goatherd scolded them for their ingratitude 
<A NAME="578"></A>in leaving him, when during the storm he had taken more care of them than 
<A NAME="579"></A>of his own herd.  One of them, turning about, said to him:  "That is the 
<A NAME="580"></A>very reason why we are so cautious; for if you yesterday treated us better 
<A NAME="581"></A>than the Goats you have had so long, it is plain also that if others came 
<A NAME="582"></A>after us, you would in the same manner prefer them to 
<A NAME="583"></A>ourselves."
<A NAME="584"></A><BR><BR>Old friends cannot with impunity be sacrificed for new 
<A NAME="585"></A>ones.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="586"></A><B>The Mischievous Dog</B>

<A NAME="587"></A><BR><BR>A Dog used to run up quietly to the heels of everyone he met, and 
<A NAME="588"></A>to bite them without notice.  His master suspended a bell about his neck 
<A NAME="589"></A>so that the Dog might give notice of his presence wherever he went.  Thinking 
<A NAME="590"></A>it a mark of distinction, the Dog grew proud of his bell and went tinkling 
<A NAME="591"></A>it all over the marketplace.  One day an old hound said to him:  Why do 
<A NAME="592"></A>you make such an exhibition of yourself? That bell that you carry is not, 
<A NAME="593"></A>believe me, any order of merit, but on the contrary a mark of disgrace, 
<A NAME="594"></A>a public notice to all men to avoid you as an ill mannered 
<A NAME="595"></A>dog."
<A NAME="596"></A><BR><BR>Notoriety is often mistaken for fame.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="597"></A><B>The Fox Who Had Lost His Tail</B>

<A NAME="598"></A><BR><BR>A Fox caught in a trap escaped, but in so doing lost his tail. 
<A NAME="599"></A>Thereafter, feeling his life a burden from the shame and ridicule to which 
<A NAME="600"></A>he was exposed, he schemed to convince all the other Foxes that being tailless 
<A NAME="601"></A>was much more attractive, thus making up for his own deprivation.  He assembled 
<A NAME="602"></A>a good many Foxes and publicly advised them to cut off their tails, saying 
<A NAME="603"></A>that they would not only look much better without them, but that they would 
<A NAME="604"></A>get rid of the weight of the brush, which was a very great inconvenience. 
<A NAME="605"></A> One of them interrupting him said, "If you had not yourself lost your 
<A NAME="606"></A>tail, my friend, you would not thus counsel us."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="607"></A><B>The Boy and the Nettles</B>

<A NAME="608"></A><BR><BR>A Boy was stung by a Nettle.  He ran home and told his Mother, 
<A NAME="609"></A>saying, "Although it hurts me very much, I only touched it gently."  "That 
<A NAME="610"></A>was just why it stung you," said his Mother.  "The next time you touch 
<A NAME="611"></A>a Nettle, grasp it boldly, and it will be soft as silk to your hand, and 
<A NAME="612"></A>not in the least hurt you."
<A NAME="613"></A><BR><BR>Whatever you do, do with all your might.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="614"></A><B>The Man and His Two Sweethearts</B>

<A NAME="615"></A><BR><BR>A middle-aged man, whose hair had begun to turn gray, courted two 
<A NAME="616"></A>women at the same time.  One of them was young, and the other well advanced 
<A NAME="617"></A>in years.  The elder woman, ashamed to be courted by a man younger than 
<A NAME="618"></A>herself, made a point, whenever her admirer visited her, to pull out some 
<A NAME="619"></A>portion of his black hairs.  The younger, on the contrary, not wishing 
<A NAME="620"></A>to become the wife of an old man, was equally zealous in removing every 
<A NAME="621"></A>gray hair she could find.  Thus it came to pass that between them both 
<A NAME="622"></A>he very soon found that he had not a hair left on his 
<A NAME="623"></A>head.
<A NAME="624"></A><BR><BR>Those who seek to please everybody please nobody.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="625"></A><B>The Astronomer</B>

<A NAME="626"></A><BR><BR>An astronomer used to go out at night to observe the stars.  One 
<A NAME="627"></A>evening, as he wandered through the suburbs with his whole attention fixed 
<A NAME="628"></A>on the sky, he fell accidentally into a deep well.  While he lamented and 
<A NAME="629"></A>bewailed his sores and bruises, and cried loudly for help, a neighbor ran 
<A NAME="630"></A>to the well, and learning what had happened said:  "Hark ye, old fellow, 
<A NAME="631"></A>why, in striving to pry into what is in heaven, do you not manage to see 
<A NAME="632"></A>what is on earth?'
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="633"></A><B>The Wolves and the Sheep</B>

<A NAME="634"></A><BR><BR>"Why should there always be this fear and slaughter between us?" 
<A NAME="635"></A>said the Wolves to the Sheep.  "Those evil-disposed Dogs have much to answer 
<A NAME="636"></A>for.  They always bark whenever we approach you and attack us before we 
<A NAME="637"></A>have done any harm.  If you would only dismiss them from your heels, there 
<A NAME="638"></A>might soon be treaties of peace and reconciliation between us."  The Sheep, 
<A NAME="639"></A>poor silly creatures, were easily beguiled and dismissed the Dogs, whereupon 
<A NAME="640"></A>the Wolves destroyed the unguarded flock at their own 
<A NAME="641"></A>pleasure.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="642"></A><B>The Old Woman and the Physician</B>

<A NAME="643"></A><BR><BR>An Old Woman having lost the use of her eyes, called in a Physician 
<A NAME="644"></A>to heal them, and made this bargain with him in the presence of witnesses: 
<A NAME="645"></A> that if he should cure her blindness, he should receive from her a sum 
<A NAME="646"></A>of money; but if her infirmity remained, she should give him nothing. 
<A NAME="647"></A> This agreement being made, the Physician, time after time, applied his 
<A NAME="648"></A>salve to her eyes, and on every visit took something away, stealing all 
<A NAME="649"></A>her property little by little.  And when he had got all she had, he healed 
<A NAME="650"></A>her and demanded the promised payment.  The Old Woman, when she recovered 
<A NAME="651"></A>her sight and saw none of her goods in her house, would give him nothing. 
<A NAME="652"></A> The Physician insisted on his claim, and.  as she still refused, summoned 
<A NAME="653"></A>her before the Judge. The Old Woman, standing up in the Court, argued: 
<A NAME="654"></A> "This man here speaks the truth in what he says; for I did promise to 
<A NAME="655"></A>give him a sum of money if I should recover my sight:  but if I continued 
<A NAME="656"></A>blind, I was to give him nothing.  Now he declares that I am healed.  I 
<A NAME="657"></A>on the contrary affirm that I am still blind; for when I lost the use of 
<A NAME="658"></A>my eyes, I saw in my house various chattels and valuable goods:  but now, 
<A NAME="659"></A>though he swears I am cured of my blindness, I am not able to see a single 
<A NAME="660"></A>thing in it."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="661"></A><B>The Fighting Cocks and the Eagle</B>

<A NAME="662"></A><BR><BR>Two game Cocks were fiercely fighting for the mastery of the farmyard. 
<A NAME="663"></A> One at last put the other to flight.  The vanquished Cock skulked away 
<A NAME="664"></A>and hid himself in a quiet corner, while the conqueror, flying up to a 
<A NAME="665"></A>high wall, flapped his wings and crowed exultingly with all his might. 
<A NAME="666"></A> An Eagle sailing through the air pounced upon him and carried him off 
<A NAME="667"></A>in his talons.  The vanquished Cock immediately came out of his corner, 
<A NAME="668"></A>and ruled henceforth with undisputed mastery.
<A NAME="669"></A><BR><BR>Pride goes before destruction.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="670"></A><B>The Charger and the Miller</B>

<A NAME="671"></A><BR><BR>A Charger, feeling the infirmities of age, was sent to work in 
<A NAME="672"></A>a mill instead of going out to battle.  But when he was compelled to grind 
<A NAME="673"></A>instead of serving in the wars, he bewailed his change of fortune and called 
<A NAME="674"></A>to mind his former state, saying, "Ah! Miller, I had indeed to go campaigning 
<A NAME="675"></A>before, but I was barbed from counter to tail, and a man went along to 
<A NAME="676"></A>groom me; and now I cannot understand what ailed me to prefer the mill 
<A NAME="677"></A>before the battle."  "Forbear," said the Miller to him, "harping on what 
<A NAME="678"></A>was of yore, for it is the common lot of mortals to sustain the ups and 
<A NAME="679"></A>downs of fortune."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="680"></A><B>The Fox and the Monkey</B>

<A NAME="681"></A><BR><BR>A Monkey once danced in an assembly of the Beasts, and so pleased 
<A NAME="682"></A>them all by his performance that they elected him their King.  A Fox, envying 
<A NAME="683"></A>him the honor, discovered a piece of meat lying in a trap, and leading 
<A NAME="684"></A>the Monkey to the place where it was, said that she had found a store, 
<A NAME="685"></A>but had not used it, she had kept it for him as treasure trove of his kingdom, 
<A NAME="686"></A>and counseled him to lay hold of it.  The Monkey approached carelessly 
<A NAME="687"></A>and was caught in the trap; and on his accusing the Fox of purposely leading 
<A NAME="688"></A>him into the snare, she replied, "O Monkey, and are you, with such a mind 
<A NAME="689"></A>as yours, going to be King over the Beasts?"
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="690"></A><B>The Horse and His Rider</B>

<A NAME="691"></A><BR><BR>A horse Soldier took the utmost pains with his charger.  As long 
<A NAME="692"></A>as the war lasted, he looked upon him as his fellow-helper in all emergencies 
<A NAME="693"></A>and fed him carefully with hay and corn.  But when the war was over, he 
<A NAME="694"></A>only allowed him chaff to eat and made him carry heavy loads of wood, subjecting 
<A NAME="695"></A>him to much slavish drudgery and ill-treatment.  War was again proclaimed, 
<A NAME="696"></A>however, and when the trumpet summoned him to his standard, the Soldier 
<A NAME="697"></A>put on his charger its military trappings, and mounted, being clad in his 
<A NAME="698"></A>heavy coat of mail.  The Horse fell down straightway under the weight, 
<A NAME="699"></A>no longer equal to the burden, and said to his master, "You must now go 
<A NAME="700"></A>to the war on foot, for you have transformed me from a Horse into an Ass; 
<A NAME="701"></A>and how can you expect that I can again turn in a moment from an Ass to 
<A NAME="702"></A>a Horse?'
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="703"></A><B>The Belly and the Members</B>

<A NAME="704"></A><BR><BR>The Members of the Body rebelled against the Belly, and said, "Why 
<A NAME="705"></A>should we be perpetually engaged in administering to your wants, while 
<A NAME="706"></A>you do nothing but take your rest, and enjoy yourself in luxury and self-indulgence?' 
<A NAME="707"></A> The Members carried out their resolve and refused their assistance to 
<A NAME="708"></A>the Belly.  The whole Body quickly became debilitated, and the hands, feet, 
<A NAME="709"></A>mouth, and eyes, when too late, repented of their folly.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="710"></A><B>The Vine and the Goat</B>

<A NAME="711"></A><BR><BR>A Vine was luxuriant in the time of vintage with leaves and grapes. 
<A NAME="712"></A> A Goat, passing by, nibbled its young tendrils and its leaves.  The Vine 
<A NAME="713"></A>addressed him and said:  "Why do you thus injure me without a cause, and 
<A NAME="714"></A>crop my leaves? Is there no young grass left? But I shall not have to wait 
<A NAME="715"></A>long for my just revenge; for if you now should crop my leaves, and cut 
<A NAME="716"></A>me down to my root, I shall provide the wine to pour over you when you 
<A NAME="717"></A>are led as a victim to the sacrifice."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="718"></A><B>Jupiter and the Monkey</B>

<A NAME="719"></A><BR><BR>Jupiter issued a proclamation to all the beasts of the forest and 
<A NAME="720"></A>promised a royal reward to the one whose offspring should be deemed the 
<A NAME="721"></A>handsomest.  The Monkey came with the rest and presented, with all a mother's 
<A NAME="722"></A>tenderness, a flat-nosed, hairless, ill-featured young Monkey as a candidate 
<A NAME="723"></A>for the promised reward.  A general laugh saluted her on the presentation 
<A NAME="724"></A>of her son.  She resolutely said, "I know not whether Jupiter will allot 
<A NAME="725"></A>the prize to my son, but this I do know, that he is at least in the eyes 
<A NAME="726"></A>of me his mother, the dearest, handsomest, and most beautiful of 
<A NAME="727"></A>all."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="728"></A><B>The Widow and Her Little Maidens</B>

<A NAME="729"></A><BR><BR>A Widow who was fond of cleaning had two little maidens to wait 
<A NAME="730"></A>on her.  She was in the habit of waking them early in the morning, at cockcrow. 
<A NAME="731"></A> The maidens, aggravated by such excessive labor, resolved to kill the 
<A NAME="732"></A>cock who roused their mistress so early.  When they had done this, they 
<A NAME="733"></A>found that they had only prepared for themselves greater troubles, for 
<A NAME="734"></A>their mistress, no longer hearing the hour from the cock, woke them up 
<A NAME="735"></A>to their work in the middle of the night.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="736"></A><B>The Shepherd's Boy and the Wolf</B>

<A NAME="737"></A><BR><BR>A Shepherd-boy, who watched a flock of sheep near a village, brought 
<A NAME="738"></A>out the villagers three or four times by crying out, "Wolf! Wolf!"  and 
<A NAME="739"></A>when his neighbors came to help him, laughed at them for their pains. 
<A NAME="740"></A> The Wolf, however, did truly come at last. The Shepherd-boy, now really 
<A NAME="741"></A>alarmed, shouted in an agony of terror:  "Pray, do come and help me; the 
<A NAME="742"></A>Wolf is killing the sheep"; but no one paid any heed to his cries, nor 
<A NAME="743"></A>rendered any assistance.  The Wolf, having no cause of fear, at his leisure 
<A NAME="744"></A>lacerated or destroyed the whole flock.
<A NAME="745"></A><BR><BR>There is no believing a liar, even when he speaks the 
<A NAME="746"></A>truth.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="747"></A><B>The Cat and the Birds</B>

<A NAME="748"></A><BR><BR>A Cat, hearing that the Birds in a certain aviary were ailing dressed 
<A NAME="749"></A>himself up as a physician, and, taking his cane and a bag of instruments 
<A NAME="750"></A>becoming his profession, went to call on them.  He knocked at the door 
<A NAME="751"></A>and inquired of the inmates how they all did, saying that if they were 
<A NAME="752"></A>ill, he would be happy to prescribe for them and cure them.  They replied, 
<A NAME="753"></A>"We are all very well, and shall continue so, if you will only be good 
<A NAME="754"></A>enough to go away, and leave us as we are."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="755"></A><B>The Kid and the Wolf</B>

<A NAME="756"></A><BR><BR>A Kid standing on the roof of a house, out of harm's way, saw a 
<A NAME="757"></A>Wolf passing by and immediately began to taunt and revile him. The Wolf, 
<A NAME="758"></A>looking up, said, "Sirrah! I hear thee:  yet it is not thou who mockest 
<A NAME="759"></A>me, but the roof on which thou art standing."
<A NAME="760"></A><BR><BR>Time and place often give the advantage to the weak over the 
<A NAME="761"></A>strong.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="762"></A><B>The Ox and the Frog</B>

<A NAME="763"></A><BR><BR>An Ox drinking at a pool trod on a brood of young frogs and crushed 
<A NAME="764"></A>one of them to death.  The Mother coming up, and missing one of her sons, 
<A NAME="765"></A>inquired of his brothers what had become of him. "He is dead, dear Mother; 
<A NAME="766"></A>for just now a very huge beast with four great feet came to the pool and 
<A NAME="767"></A>crushed him to death with his cloven heel."  The Frog, puffing herself 
<A NAME="768"></A>out, inquired, "if the beast was as big as that in size."  "Cease, Mother, 
<A NAME="769"></A>to puff yourself out," said her son, "and do not be angry; for you would, 
<A NAME="770"></A>I assure you, sooner burst than successfully imitate the hugeness of that 
<A NAME="771"></A>monster."
