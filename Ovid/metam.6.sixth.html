<A NAME="10"></A><B>The Transformation of Arachne into a Spider</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>Pallas, attending to the Muse's song,
<A NAME="12"></A><BR>Approv'd the just resentment of their wrong;
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>And thus reflects: While tamely I commend
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>Those who their injur'd deities defend,
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>My own divinity affronted stands,
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>And calls aloud for justice at my hands;
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>Then takes the hint, asham'd to lag behind,
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>And on Arachne' bends her vengeful mind;
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>One at the loom so excellently skill'd,
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>That to the Goddess she refus'd to yield.
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>Low was her birth, and small her native town,
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>She from her art alone obtain'd renown.
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>Idmon, her father, made it his employ,
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>To give the spungy fleece a purple dye:
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>Of vulgar strain her mother, lately dead,
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>With her own rank had been content to wed;
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>Yet she their daughter, tho' her time was spent
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>In a small hamlet, and of mean descent,
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>Thro' the great towns of Lydia gain'd a name,
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>And fill'd the neighb'ring countries with her fame.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR>Oft, to admire the niceness of her skill,
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>The Nymphs would quit their fountain, shade, or 
<A NAME="33"></A>hill:
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>Thither, from green Tymolus, they repair,
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>And leave the vineyards, their peculiar care;
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>Thither, from fam'd Pactolus' golden stream,
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>Drawn by her art, the curious Naiads came.
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>Nor would the work, when finish'd, please so much,
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>As, while she wrought, to view each graceful touch;
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>Whether the shapeless wool in balls she wound,
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>Or with quick motion turn'd the spindle round,
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>Or with her pencil drew the neat design,
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>Pallas her mistress shone in every line.
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>This the proud maid with scornful air denies,
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>And ev'n the Goddess at her work defies;
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>Disowns her heav'nly mistress ev'ry hour,
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>Nor asks her aid, nor deprecates her pow'r.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>Let us, she cries, but to a tryal come,
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>And, if she conquers, let her fix my doom.
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR>The Goddess then a beldame's form put on,
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>With silver hairs her hoary temples shone;
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>Prop'd by a staff, she hobbles in her walk,
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>And tott'ring thus begins her old wives' talk.
<A NAME="54"></A><BR><BR>Young maid attend, nor stubbornly despise
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>The admonitions of the old, and wise;
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>For age, tho' scorn'd, a ripe experience bears,
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>That golden fruit, unknown to blooming years:
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>Still may remotest fame your labours crown,
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>And mortals your superior genius own;
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>But to the Goddess yield, and humbly meek
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>A pardon for your bold presumption seek;
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>The Goddess will forgive. At this the maid,
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>With passion fir'd, her gliding shuttle stay'd;
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>And, darting vengeance with an angry look,
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>To Pallas in disguise thus fiercely spoke.
<A NAME="66"></A><BR><BR>Thou doating thing, whose idle babling tongue
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>But too well shews the plague of living long;
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>Hence, and reprove, with this your sage advice,
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>Your giddy daughter, or your aukward neice;
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>Know, I despise your counsel, and am still
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>A woman, ever wedded to my will;
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>And, if your skilful Goddess better knows,
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>Let her accept the tryal I propose.
<A NAME="74"></A><BR><BR>She does, impatient Pallas strait replies,
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>And, cloath'd with heavenly light, sprung from her odd 
<A NAME="76"></A>disguise.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>The Nymphs, and virgins of the plain adore
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>The awful Goddess, and confess her pow'r;
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>The maid alone stood unappall'd; yet show'd
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>A transient blush, that for a moment glow'd,
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>Then disappear'd; as purple streaks adorn
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>The opening beauties of the rosy morn;
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>Till Phoebus rising prevalently bright,
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>Allays the tincture with his silver light.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>Yet she persists, and obstinately great,
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>In hopes of conquest hurries on her fate.
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>The Goddess now the challenge waves no more,
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>Nor, kindly good, advises as before.
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>Strait to their posts appointed both repair,
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>And fix their threaded looms with equal care:
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>Around the solid beam the web is ty'd,
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>While hollow canes the parting warp divide;
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>Thro' which with nimble flight the shuttles play,
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>And for the woof prepare a ready way;
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>The woof and warp unite, press'd by the toothy slay.
<A NAME="96"></A><BR><BR>Thus both, their mantles button'd to their breast,
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>Their skilful fingers ply with willing haste,
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>And work with pleasure; while they chear the eye
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>With glowing purple of the Tyrian dye:
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>Or, justly intermixing shades with light,
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>Their colourings insensibly unite.
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>As when a show'r transpierc'd with sunny rays,
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>Its mighty arch along the heav'n displays;
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>From whence a thousand diff'rent colours rise,
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>Whose fine transition cheats the clearest eyes;
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>So like the intermingled shading seems,
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>And only differs in the last extreams.
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>Then threads of gold both artfully dispose,
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>And, as each part in just proportion rose,
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>Some antique fable in their work disclose.
<A NAME="111"></A><BR><BR>Pallas in figures wrought the heav'nly Pow'rs,
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>And Mars's hill among th' Athenian tow'rs.
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>On lofty thrones twice six celestials sate,
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>Jove in the midst, and held their warm debate;
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>The subject weighty, and well-known to fame,
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>From whom the city shou'd receive its name.
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>Each God by proper features was exprest,
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>Jove with majestick mein excell'd the rest.
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>His three-fork'd mace the dewy sea-God shook,
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>And, looking sternly, smote the ragged rock;
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>When from the stone leapt forth a spritely steed,
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>And Neptune claims the city for the deed.
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>Herself she blazons, with a glitt'ring spear,
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>And crested helm that veil'd her braided hair,
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>With shield, and scaly breast-plate, implements of 
<A NAME="126"></A>war.
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>Struck with her pointed launce, the teeming Earth
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>Seem'd to produce a new surprizing birth;
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>When, from the glebe, the pledge of conquest sprung,
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>A tree pale-green with fairest olives hung.
<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR>And then, to let her giddy rival learn
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>What just rewards such boldness was to earn,
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>Four tryals at each corner had their part,
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>Design'd in miniature, and touch'd with art.
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>Haemus in one, and Rodope of Thrace
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>Transform'd to mountains, fill'd the foremost place;
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>Who claim'd the titles of the Gods above,
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>And vainly us'd the epithets of Jove.
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>Another shew'd, where the Pigmaean dame,
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>Profaning Juno's venerable name,
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>Turn'd to an airy crane, descends from far,
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>And with her Pigmy subjects wages war.
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>In a third part, the rage of Heav'n's great queen,
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>Display'd on proud Antigone, was seen:
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>Who with presumptuous boldness dar'd to vye,
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>For beauty with the empress of the sky.
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>Ah! what avails her ancient princely race,
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>Her sire a king, and Troy her native place:
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>Now, to a noisy stork transform'd, she flies,
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>And with her whiten'd pinions cleaves the skies.
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>And in the last remaining part was drawn
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>Poor Cinyras that seem'd to weep in stone;
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>Clasping the temple steps, he sadly mourn'd
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>His lovely daughters, now to marble turn'd.
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>With her own tree the finish'd piece is crown'd,
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>And wreaths of peaceful olive all the work surround.
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR>Arachne drew the fam'd intrigues of Jove,
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>Chang'd to a bull to gratify his love;
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>How thro' the briny tide all foaming hoar,
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>Lovely Europa on his back he bore.
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>The sea seem'd waving, and the trembling maid
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>Shrunk up her tender feet, as if afraid;
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>And, looking back on the forsaken strand,
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>To her companions wafts her distant hand.
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>Next she design'd Asteria's fabled rape,
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>When Jove assum'd a soaring eagle's shape:
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>And shew'd how Leda lay supinely press'd,
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>Whilst the soft snowy swan sate hov'ring o'er her 
<A NAME="169"></A>breast,
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>How in a satyr's form the God beguil'd,
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>When fair Antiope with twins he fill'd.
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>Then, like Amphytrion, but a real Jove,
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>In fair Alcmena's arms he cool'd his love.
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>In fluid gold to Danae's heart he came,
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>Aegina felt him in a lambent flame.
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>He took Mnemosyne in shepherd's make,
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>And for Deois was a speckled snake.
<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR>She made thee, Neptune, like a wanton steer,
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>Pacing the meads for love of Arne dear;
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>Next like a stream, thy burning flame to slake,
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>And like a ram, for fair Bisaltis' sake.
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>Then Ceres in a steed your vigour try'd,
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>Nor cou'd the mare the yellow Goddess hide.
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>Next, to a fowl transform'd, you won by force
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>The snake-hair'd mother of the winged horse;
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>And, in a dolphin's fishy form, subdu'd
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>Melantho sweet beneath the oozy flood.
<A NAME="188"></A><BR><BR>All these the maid with lively features drew,
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>And open'd proper landskips to the view.
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>There Phoebus, roving like a country swain,
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>Attunes his jolly pipe along the plain;
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>For lovely Isse's sake in shepherd's weeds,
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>O'er pastures green his bleating flock he feeds,
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>There Bacchus, imag'd like the clust'ring grape,
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>Melting bedrops Erigone's fair lap;
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>And there old Saturn, stung with youthful heat,
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>Form'd like a stallion, rushes to the feat.
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>Fresh flow'rs, which twists of ivy intertwine,
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>Mingling a running foliage, close the neat design.
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR>This the bright Goddess passionately mov'd,
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>With envy saw, yet inwardly approv'd.
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>The scene of heav'nly guilt with haste she tore,
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>Nor longer the affront with patience bore;
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>A boxen shuttle in her hand she took,
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>And more than once Arachne's forehead struck.
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>Th' unhappy maid, impatient of the wrong,
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>Down from a beam her injur'd person hung;
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>When Pallas, pitying her wretched state,
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>At once prevented, and pronounc'd her fate:
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>Live; but depend, vile wretch, the Goddess cry'd,
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>Doom'd in suspence for ever to be ty'd;
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>That all your race, to utmost date of time,
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>May feel the vengeance, and detest the crime.
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR>Then, going off, she sprinkled her with juice,
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>Which leaves of baneful aconite produce.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>Touch'd with the pois'nous drug, her flowing hair
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>Fell to the ground, and left her temples bare;
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>Her usual features vanish'd from their place,
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>Her body lessen'd all, but most her face.
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>Her slender fingers, hanging on each side
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>With many joynts, the use of legs supply'd:
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>A spider's bag the rest, from which she gives
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>A thread, and still by constant weaving lives.
<A NAME="224"></A><BR><BR><B>The Story of Niobe</B>
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR>Swift thro' the Phrygian towns the rumour flies,
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>And the strange news each female tongue employs:
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>Niobe, who before she married knew
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>The famous nymph, now found the story true;
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>Yet, unreclaim'd by poor Arachne's fate,
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>Vainly above the Gods assum'd a state.
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>Her husband's fame, their family's descent,
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>Their pow'r, and rich dominion's wide extent,
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>Might well have justify'd a decent pride;
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>But not on these alone the dame rely'd.
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>Her lovely progeny, that far excell'd,
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>The mother's heart with vain ambition swell'd:
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>The happiest mother not unjustly styl'd,
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>Had no conceited thoughts her tow'ring fancy fill'd.
<A NAME="239"></A><BR><BR>For once a prophetess with zeal inspir'd,
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>Their slow neglect to warm devotion fir'd;
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>Thro' ev'ry street of Thebes who ran possess'd,
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>And thus in accents wild her charge express'd:
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>Haste, haste, ye Theban matrons, and adore,
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>With hallow'd rites, Latona's mighty pow'r;
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>And, to the heav'nly twins that from her spring,
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>With laurel crown'd, your smoaking incense bring.
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>Strait the great summons ev'ry dame obey'd,
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>And due submission to the Goddess paid:
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>Graceful, with laurel chaplets dress'd, they came,
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>And offer'd incense in the sacred flame.
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR>Mean-while, surrounded with a courtly guard,
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>The royal Niobe in state appear'd;
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>Attir'd in robes embroider'd o'er with gold,
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>And mad with rage, yet lovely to behold:
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>Her comely tresses, trembling as she stood,
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>Down her fine neck with easy motion flow'd;
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>Then, darting round a proud disdainful look,
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>In haughty tone her hasty passion broke,
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>And thus began: What madness this, to court
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>A Goddess, founded meerly on report?
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>Dare ye a poor pretended Pow'r invoke,
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>While yet no altars to my godhead smoke?
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>Mine, whose immediate lineage stands confess'd
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>From Tantalus, the only mortal guest
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>That e'er the Gods admitted to their feast.
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>A sister of the Pleiads gave me birth;
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>And Atlas, mightiest mountain upon Earth,
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>Who bears the globe of all the stars above,
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>My grandsire was, and Atlas sprung from Jove.
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>The Theban towns my majesty adore,
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>And neighb'ring Phrygia trembles at my pow'r:
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>Rais'd by my husband's lute, with turrets crown'd,
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>Our lofty city stands secur'd around.
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>Within my court, where-e'er I turn my eyes,
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>Unbounded treasures to my prospect rise:
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>With these my face I modestly may name,
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>As not unworthy of so high a claim;
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>Seven are my daughters, of a form divine,
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>With seven fair sons, an indefective line.
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>Go, fools! consider this; and ask the cause
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>From which my pride its strong presumption draws;
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>Consider this; and then prefer to me
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>Caeus the Titan's vagrant progeny;
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>To whom, in travel, the whole spacious Earth
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>No room afforded for her spurious birth.
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>Not the least part in Earth, in Heav'n, or seas,
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>Would grant your out-law'd Goddess any ease:
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>'Till pitying hers, from his own wand'ring case,
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>Delos, the floating island, gave a place.
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>There she a mother was, of two at most;
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>Only the seventh part of what I boast.
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>My joys all are beyond suspicion fix'd;
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>With no pollutions of misfortune mix'd;
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>Safe on the Basis of my pow'r I stand,
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>Above the reach of Fortune's fickle hand.
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>Lessen she may my inexhausted store,
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>And much destroy, yet still must leave me more.
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>Suppose it possible that some may dye
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>Of this my num'rous lovely progeny;
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>Still with Latona I might safely vye.
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>Who, by her scanty breed, scarce fit to name,
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>But just escapes the childless woman's shame.
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>Go then, with speed your laurel'd heads uncrown,
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>And leave the silly farce you have begun.
<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR>The tim'rous throng their sacred rites forbore,
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>And from their heads the verdant laurel tore;
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>Their haughty queen they with regret obey'd,
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>And still in gentle murmurs softly pray'd.
<A NAME="309"></A><BR><BR>High, on the top of Cynthus' shady mount,
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>With grief the Goddess saw the base affront;
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>And, the abuse revolving in her breast,
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>The mother her twin-offspring thus addrest.
<A NAME="313"></A><BR><BR>Lo I, my children, who with comfort knew
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>Your God-like birth, and thence my glory drew;
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>And thence have claim'd precedency of place
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>From all but Juno of the heav'nly race,
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>Must now despair, and languish in disgrace.
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>My godhead question'd, and all rites divine,
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>Unless you succour, banish'd from my shrine.
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>Nay more, the imp of Tantalus has flung
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>Reflections with her vile paternal tongue;
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>Has dar'd prefer her mortal breed to mine,
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>And call'd me childless; which, just fate, may she 
<A NAME="324"></A>repine!
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR>When to urge more the Goddess was prepar'd,
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>Phoebus in haste replies, Too much we've heard,
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>And ev'ry moment's lost, while vengeance is defer'd.
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>Diana spoke the same. Then both enshroud
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>Their heav'nly bodies in a sable cloud;
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>And to the Theban tow'rs descending light,
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>Thro' the soft yielding air direct their flight.
<A NAME="332"></A><BR><BR>Without the wall there lies a champian ground
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>With even surface, far extending round,
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>Beaten and level'd, while it daily feels
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>The trampling horse, and chariot's grinding wheels.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>Part of proud Niobe's young rival breed,
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>Practising there to ride the manag'd steed,
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>Their bridles boss'd with gold, were mounted high
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>On stately furniture of Tyrian dye.
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>Of these, Ismenos, who by birth had been
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>The first fair issue of the fruitful queen,
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>Just as he drew the rein to guide his horse,
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>Around the compass of the circling course,
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>Sigh'd deeply, and the pangs of smart express'd,
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>While the shaft stuck, engor'd within his breast:
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>And, the reins dropping from his dying hand,
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>He sunk quite down, and tumbled on the sand.
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>Sipylus next the rattling quiver heard,
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>And with full speed for his escape prepar'd;
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>As when the pilot from the black'ning skies
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>A gath'ring storm of wintry rain descries,
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>His sails unfurl'd, and crowded all with wind,
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>He strives to leave the threat'ning cloud behind:
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>So fled the youth; but an unerring dart
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>O'ertook him, quick discharg'd, and sped with art;
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>Fix'd in his neck behind, it trembling stood,
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>And at his throat display'd the point besmear'd with 
<A NAME="358"></A>blood
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>Prone, as his posture was, he tumbled o'er,
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>And bath'd his courser's mane with steaming gore.
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>Next at young Phaedimus they took their aim,
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>And Tantalus who bore his grandsire's name:
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>These, when their other exercise was done,
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>To try the wrestler's oily sport begun;
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>And, straining ev'ry nerve, their skill express'd
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>In closest grapple, joining breast to breast:
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>When from the bending bow an arrow sent,
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>Joyn'd as they were, thro' both their bodies went:
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>Both groan'd, and writhing both their limbs with 
<A NAME="370"></A>pain,
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>They fell together bleeding on the plain;
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>Then both their languid eye-balls faintly roul,
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>And thus together breathe away their soul.
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>With grief Alphenor saw their doleful plight,
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>And smote his breast, and sicken'd at the sight;
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>Then to their succour ran with eager haste,
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>And, fondly griev'd, their stiff'ning limbs embrac'd;
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>But in the action falls: a thrilling dart,
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>By Phoebus guided, pierc'd him to the heart.
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>This, as they drew it forth, his midriff tore,
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>Its barbed point the fleshy fragments bore,
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>And let the soul gush out in streams of purple gore.
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>But Damasichthon, by a double wound,
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>Beardless, and young, lay gasping on the ground.
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>Fix'd in his sinewy ham, the steely point
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>Stuck thro' his knee, and pierc'd the nervous joint:
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>And, as he stoop'd to tug the painful dart,
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>Another struck him in a vital part;
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>Shot thro' his wezon, by the wing it hung.
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>The life-blood forc'd it out, and darting upward 
<A NAME="391"></A>sprung,
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>Ilioneus, the last, with terror stands,
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>Lifting in pray'r his unavailing hands;
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>And, ignorant from whom his griefs arise,
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>Spare me, o all ye heav'nly Pow'rs, he cries:
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>Phoebus was touch'd too late, the sounding bow
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>Had sent the shaft, and struck the fatal blow;
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>Which yet but gently gor'd his tender side,
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>So by a slight and easy wound he dy'd.
<A NAME="400"></A><BR><BR>Swift to the mother's ears the rumour came,
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>And doleful sighs the heavy news proclaim;
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>With anger and surprize inflam'd by turns,
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>In furious rage her haughty stomach burns:
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>First she disputes th' effects of heav'nly pow'r,
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>Then at their daring boldness wonders more;
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>For poor Amphion with sore grief distrest,
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>Hoping to sooth his cares by endless rest,
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>Had sheath'd a dagger in his wretched breast.
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>And she, who toss'd her high disdainful head,
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>When thro' the streets in solemn pomp she led
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>The throng that from Latona's altar fled,
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>Assuming state beyond the proudest queen;
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>Was now the miserablest object seen.
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>Prostrate among the clay-cold dead she fell,
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>And kiss'd an undistinguish'd last farewel.
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>Then her pale arms advancing to the skies,
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>Cruel Latona! triumph now, she cries.
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>My grieving soul in bitter anguish drench,
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>And with my woes your thirsty passion quench;
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>Feast your black malice at a price thus dear,
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>While the sore pangs of sev'n such deaths I bear.
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>Triumph, too cruel rival, and display
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>Your conqu'ring standard; for you've won the day.
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>Yet I'll excel; for yet, tho' sev'n are slain,
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>Superior still in number I remain.
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>Scarce had she spoke; the bow-string's twanging 
<A NAME="427"></A>sound
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>Was heard, and dealt fresh terrors all around;
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>Which all, but Niobe alone, confound.
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>Stunn'd, and obdurate by her load of grief,
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>Insensible she sits, nor hopes relief.
<A NAME="432"></A><BR><BR>Before the fun'ral biers, all weeping sad,
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>Her daughters stood, in vests of sable clad,
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>When one, surpriz'd, and stung with sudden smart,
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>In vain attempts to draw the sticking dart:
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>But to grim death her blooming youth resigns,
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>And o'er her brother's corpse her dying head reclines.
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>This, to asswage her mother's anguish tries,
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>And, silenc'd in the pious action, dies;
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>Shot by a secret arrow, wing'd with death,
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>Her fault'ring lips but only gasp'd for breath.
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>One, on her dying sister, breathes her last;
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>Vainly in flight another's hopes are plac'd:
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>This hiding, from her fate a shelter seeks;
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>That trembling stands, and fills the air with shrieks.
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>And all in vain; for now all six had found
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>Their way to death, each by a diff'rent wound.
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>The last, with eager care the mother veil'd,
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>Behind her spreading mantle close conceal'd,
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>And with her body guarded, as a shield.
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>Only for this, this youngest, I implore,
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>Grant me this one request, I ask no more;
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>O grant me this! she passionately cries:
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>But while she speaks, the destin'd virgin dies.
<A NAME="455"></A><BR><BR><B>The Transformation of Niobe</B>
<A NAME="456"></A><BR><BR>Widow'd, and childless, lamentable state!
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>A doleful sight, among the dead she sate;
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>Harden'd with woes, a statue of despair,
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>To ev'ry breath of wind unmov'd her hair;
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>Her cheek still red'ning, but its colour dead,
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>Faded her eyes, and set within her head.
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>No more her pliant tongue its motion keeps,
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>But stands congeal'd within her frozen lips.
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>Stagnate, and dull, within her purple veins,
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>Its current stop'd, the lifeless blood remains.
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>Her feet their usual offices refuse,
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>Her arms, and neck their graceful gestures lose:
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>Action, and life from ev'ry part are gone,
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>And ev'n her entrails turn to solid stone;
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>Yet still she weeps, and whirl'd by stormy winds,
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>Born thro' the air, her native country finds;
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>There fix'd, she stands upon a bleaky hill,
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>There yet her marble cheeks eternal tears distil.
<A NAME="474"></A><BR><BR><B>The Peasants of Lycia transform'd to Frogs</B>
<A NAME="475"></A><BR><BR>Then all, reclaim'd by this example, show'd
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>A due regard for each peculiar God:
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>Both men, and women their devoirs express'd,
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>And great Latona's awful pow'r confess'd.
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>Then, tracing instances of older time,
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>To suit the nature of the present crime,
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>Thus one begins his tale.- Where Lycia yields
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>A golden harvest from its fertile fields,
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>Some churlish peasants, in the days of yore,
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>Provok'd the Goddess to exert her pow'r.
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>The thing indeed the meanness of the place
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>Has made obscure, surprizing as it was;
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>But I my self once happen'd to behold
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>This famous lake of which the story's told.
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>My father then, worn out by length of days,
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>Nor able to sustain the tedious ways,
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>Me with a guide had sent the plains to roam,
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>And drive his well-fed stragling heifers home.
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>Here, as we saunter'd thro' the verdant meads,
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>We spy'd a lake o'er-grown with trembling reeds,
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>Whose wavy tops an op'ning scene disclose,
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>From which an antique smoaky altar rose.
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>I, as my susperstitious guide had done,
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>Stop'd short, and bless'd my self, and then went 
<A NAME="499"></A>on;
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>Yet I enquir'd to whom the altar stood,
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>Faunus, the Naids, or some native God?
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>No silvan deity, my friend replies,
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>Enshrin'd within this hallow'd altar lies.
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>For this, o youth, to that fam'd Goddess stands,
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>Whom, at th' imperial Juno's rough commands,
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>Of ev'ry quarter of the Earth bereav'd,
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>Delos, the floating isle, at length receiv'd.
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>Who there, in spite of enemies, brought forth,
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>Beneath an olive's shade, her great twin-birth.
<A NAME="510"></A><BR><BR>Hence too she fled the furious stepdame's pow'r,
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>And in her arms a double godhead bore;
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>And now the borders of fair Lycia gain'd,
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>Just when the summer solstice parch'd the land.
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>With thirst the Goddess languishing, no more
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>Her empty'd breast would yield its milky store;
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>When, from below, the smiling valley show'd
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>A silver lake that in its bottom flow'd:
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>A sort of clowns were reaping, near the bank,
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>The bending osier, and the bullrush dank;
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>The cresse, and water-lilly, fragrant weed,
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>Whose juicy stalk the liquid fountains feed.
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>The Goddess came, and kneeling on the brink,
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>Stoop'd at the fresh repast, prepar'd to drink.
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>Then thus, being hinder'd by the rabble race,
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>In accents mild expostulates the case.
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>Water I only ask, and sure 'tis hard
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>From Nature's common rights to be debar'd:
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>This, as the genial sun, and vital air,
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>Should flow alike to ev'ry creature's share.
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>Yet still I ask, and as a favour crave,
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>That which, a publick bounty, Nature gave.
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>Nor do I seek my weary limbs to drench;
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>Only, with one cool draught, my thirst I'd quench.
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>Now from my throat the usual moisture dries,
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>And ev'n my voice in broken accents dies:
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>One draught as dear as life I should esteem,
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>And water, now I thirst, would nectar seem.
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>Oh! let my little babes your pity move,
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>And melt your hearts to charitable love;
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>They (as by chance they did) extend to you
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>Their little hands, and my request pursue.
<A NAME="542"></A><BR><BR>Whom would these soft perswasions not subdue,
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>Tho' the most rustick, and unmanner'd crew?
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>Yet they the Goddess's request refuse,
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>And with rude words reproachfully abuse:
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>Nay more, with spiteful feet the villains trod
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>O'er the soft bottom of the marshy flood,
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>And blacken'd all the lake with clouds of rising 
<A NAME="549"></A>mud.
<A NAME="550"></A><BR><BR>Her thirst by indignation was suppress'd;
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>Bent on revenge, the Goddess stood confess'd.
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>Her suppliant hands uplifting to the skies,
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>For a redress, to Heav'n she now applies.
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>And, May you live, she passionately cry'd,
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>Doom'd in that pool for ever to abide.
<A NAME="556"></A><BR><BR>The Goddess has her wish; for now they chuse
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>To plunge, and dive among the watry ooze;
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>Sometimes they shew their head above the brim,
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>And on the glassy surface spread to swim;
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>Often upon the bank their station take,
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>Then spring, and leap into the cooly lake.
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>Still, void of shame, they lead a clam'rous life,
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>And, croaking, still scold on in endless strife;
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>Compell'd to live beneath the liquid stream,
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>Where still they quarrel, and attempt to skream.
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>Now, from their bloated throat, their voice puts 
<A NAME="567"></A>on
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>Imperfect murmurs in a hoarser tone;
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>Their noisy jaws, with bawling now grown wide,
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>An ugly sight! extend on either side:
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>Their motly back, streak'd with a list of green,
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>Joyn'd to their head, without a neck is seen;
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>And, with a belly broad and white, they look
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>Meer frogs, and still frequent the muddy brook.
<A NAME="575"></A><BR><BR><B>The Fate of Marsyas</B>
<A NAME="576"></A><BR><BR>Scarce had the man this famous story told,
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>Of vengeance on the Lycians shown of old,
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>When strait another pictures to their view
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>The Satyr's fate, whom angry Phoebus slew;
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>Who, rais'd with high conceit, and puff'd with pride,
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>At his own pipe the skilful God defy'd.
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>Why do you tear me from my self, he cries?
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>Ah cruel! must my skin be made the prize?
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>This for a silly pipe? he roaring said,
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>Mean-while the skin from off his limbs was flay'd.
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>All bare, and raw, one large continu'd wound,
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>With streams of blood his body bath'd the ground.
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>The blueish veins their trembling pulse disclos'd,
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>The stringy nerves lay naked, and expos'd;
<A NAME="590"></A><BR>His guts appear'd, distinctly each express'd,
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>With ev'ry shining fibre of his breast.
<A NAME="592"></A><BR><BR>The Fauns, and Silvans, with the Nymphs that 
<A NAME="593"></A>rove
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>Among the Satyrs in the shady grove;
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>Olympus, known of old, and ev'ry swain
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>That fed, or flock, or herd upon the plain,
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>Bewail'd the loss; and with their tears that flow'd,
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>A kindly moisture on the earth bestow'd;
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>That soon, conjoyn'd, and in a body rang'd,
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>Sprung from the ground, to limpid water chang'd;
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>Which, down thro' Phrygia's rocks, a mighty stream,
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>Comes tumbling to the sea, and Marsya is its name.
<A NAME="603"></A><BR><BR><B>The Story of Pelops</B>
<A NAME="604"></A><BR><BR>From these relations strait the people turn
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>To present truths, and lost Amphion mourn:
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>The mother most was blam'd, yet some relate
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>That Pelops pity'd, and bewail'd her fate,
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>And stript his cloaths, and laid his shoulder bare,
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>And made the iv'ry miracle appear.
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>This shoulder, from the first, was form'd of flesh,
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>As lively as the other, and as fresh;
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>But, when the youth was by his father slain,
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>The Gods restor'd his mangled limbs again;
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>Only that place which joins the neck and arm,
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>The rest untouch'd, was found to suffer harm:
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>The loss of which an iv'ry piece sustain'd;
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>And thus the youth his limbs, and life regain'd.
<A NAME="618"></A><BR><BR><B>The Story of Tereus, Procne, and Philomela</B>
<A NAME="619"></A><BR><BR>To Thebes the neighb'ring princes all repair,
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>And with condolance the misfortune share.
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>Each bord'ring state in solemn form address'd,
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>And each betimes a friendly grief express'd.
<A NAME="623"></A><BR>Argos, with Sparta's, and Mycenae's towns,
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>And Calydon, yet free from fierce Diana's frowns.
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>Corinth for finest brass well fam'd of old,
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>Orthomenos for men of courage bold:
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>Cleonae lying in the lowly dale,
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>And rich Messene with its fertile vale:
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>Pylos, for Nestor's City after fam'd,
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>And Troezen, not as yet from Pittheus nam'd.
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>And those fair cities, which are hem'd around
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>By double seas within the Isthmian ground;
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>And those, which farther from the sea-coast stand,
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>Lodg'd in the bosom of the spacious land.
<A NAME="635"></A><BR><BR>Who can believe it? Athens was the last:
<A NAME="636"></A><BR>Tho' for politeness fam'd for ages past.
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>For a strait siege, which then their walls enclos'd,
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>Such acts of kind humanity oppos'd:
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>And thick with ships, from foreign nations bound,
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>Sea-ward their city lay invested round.
<A NAME="641"></A><BR><BR>These, with auxiliar forces led from far,
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>Tereus of Thrace, brave, and inur'd to war,
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>Had quite defeated, and obtain'd a name,
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>The warrior's due, among the sons of Fame.
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>This, with his wealth, and pow'r, and ancient line,
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>From Mars deriv'd, Pandions's thoughts incline
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>His daughter Procne with the prince to joyn.
<A NAME="648"></A><BR><BR>Nor Hymen, nor the Graces here preside,
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>Nor Juno to befriend the blooming bride;
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>But Fiends with fun'ral brands the process led,
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>And Furies waited at the Genial bed:
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>And all night long the scrieching owl aloof,
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>With baleful notes, sate brooding o'er the roof.
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>With such ill Omens was the match begun,
<A NAME="655"></A><BR>That made them parents of a hopeful son.
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>Now Thrace congratulates their seeming joy,
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>And they, in thankful rites, their minds employ.
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>If the fair queen's espousals pleas'd before,
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>Itys, the new-born prince, now pleases more;
<A NAME="660"></A><BR>And each bright day, the birth, and bridal feast,
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>Were kept with hallow'd pomp above the rest.
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>So far true happiness may lye conceal'd,
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>When, by false lights, we fancy 'tis reveal'd!
<A NAME="664"></A><BR><BR>Now, since their nuptials, had the golden sun
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>Five courses round his ample zodiac run;
<A NAME="666"></A><BR>When gentle Procne thus her lord address'd,
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>And spoke the secret wishes of her breast:
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>If I, she said, have ever favour found,
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>Let my petition with success be crown'd:
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>Let me at Athens my dear sister see,
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>Or let her come to Thrace, and visit me.
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>And, lest my father should her absence mourn,
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>Promise that she shall make a quick return.
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>With thanks I'd own the obligation due
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>Only, o Tereus, to the Gods, and you.
<A NAME="676"></A><BR><BR>Now, ply'd with oar, and sail at his command,
<A NAME="677"></A><BR>The nimble gallies reach'd th' Athenian land,
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>And anchor'd in the fam'd Piraean bay,
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>While Tereus to the palace takes his way;
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>The king salutes, and ceremonies past,
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>Begins the fatal embassy at last;
<A NAME="682"></A><BR>The occasion of his voyage he declares,
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>And, with his own, his wife's request prefers:
<A NAME="684"></A><BR>Asks leave that, only for a little space,
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>Their lovely sister might embark for Thrace.
<A NAME="686"></A><BR><BR>Thus while he spoke, appear'd the royal maid,
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>Bright Philomela, splendidly array'd;
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>But most attractive in her charming face,
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>And comely person, turn'd with ev'ry grace:
<A NAME="690"></A><BR>Like those fair Nymphs, that are describ'd to rove
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>Across the glades, and op'nings of the grove;
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>Only that these are dress'd for silvan sports,
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>And less become the finery of courts.
<A NAME="694"></A><BR><BR>Tereus beheld the virgin, and admir'd,
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>And with the coals of burning lust was fir'd:
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>Like crackling stubble, or the summer hay,
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>When forked lightnings o'er the meadows play.
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>Such charms in any breast might kindle love,
<A NAME="699"></A><BR>But him the heats of inbred lewdness move;
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>To which, tho' Thrace is naturally prone,
<A NAME="701"></A><BR>Yet his is still superior, and his own.
<A NAME="702"></A><BR>Strait her attendants he designs to buy,
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>And with large bribes her governess would try:
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>Herself with ample gifts resolves to bend,
<A NAME="705"></A><BR>And his whole kingdom in th' attempt expend:
<A NAME="706"></A><BR>Or, snatch'd away by force of arms, to bear,
<A NAME="707"></A><BR>And justify the rape with open war.
<A NAME="708"></A><BR>The boundless passion boils within his breast,
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>And his projecting soul admits no rest.
<A NAME="710"></A><BR><BR>And now, impatient of the least delay,
<A NAME="711"></A><BR>By pleading Procne's cause, he speeds his way:
<A NAME="712"></A><BR>The eloquence of love his tongue inspires,
<A NAME="713"></A><BR>And, in his wife's, he speaks his own desires;
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>Hence all his importunities arise,
<A NAME="715"></A><BR>And tears unmanly trickle from his eyes.
<A NAME="716"></A><BR><BR>Ye Gods! what thick involving darkness blinds
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>The stupid faculties of mortal minds!
<A NAME="718"></A><BR>Tereus the credit of good-nature gains
<A NAME="719"></A><BR>From these his crimes; so well the villain feigns.
<A NAME="720"></A><BR>And, unsuspecting of his base designs,
<A NAME="721"></A><BR>In the request fair Philomela joyns;
<A NAME="722"></A><BR>Her snowy arms her aged sire embrace,
<A NAME="723"></A><BR>And clasp his neck with an endearing grace:
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>Only to see her sister she entreats,
<A NAME="725"></A><BR>A seeming blessing, which a curse compleats.
<A NAME="726"></A><BR>Tereus surveys her with a luscious eye,
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>And in his mind forestalls the blissful joy:
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>Her circling arms a scene of lust inspire,
<A NAME="729"></A><BR>And ev'ry kiss foments the raging fire.
<A NAME="730"></A><BR>Fondly he wishes for the father's place,
<A NAME="731"></A><BR>To feel, and to return the warm embrace;
<A NAME="732"></A><BR>Since not the nearest ties of filial blood
<A NAME="733"></A><BR>Would damp his flame, and force him to be good.
<A NAME="734"></A><BR><BR>At length, for both their sakes, the king agrees;
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>And Philomela, on her bended knees,
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>Thanks him for what her fancy calls success,
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>When cruel fate intends her nothing less.
<A NAME="738"></A><BR><BR>Now Phoebus, hastning to ambrosial rest,
<A NAME="739"></A><BR>His fiery steeds drove sloping down the west:
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>The sculptur'd gold with sparkling wines was fill'd,
<A NAME="741"></A><BR>And, with rich meats, each chearful table smil'd.
<A NAME="742"></A><BR>Plenty, and mirth the royal banquet close,
<A NAME="743"></A><BR>Then all retire to sleep, and sweet repose.
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>But the lewd monarch, tho' withdrawn apart,
<A NAME="745"></A><BR>Still feels love's poison rankling in his heart:
<A NAME="746"></A><BR>Her face divine is stamp'd within his breast,
<A NAME="747"></A><BR>Fancy imagines, and improves the rest:
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>And thus, kept waking by intense desire,
<A NAME="749"></A><BR>He nourishes his own prevailing fire.
<A NAME="750"></A><BR><BR>Next day the good old king for Tereus sends,
<A NAME="751"></A><BR>And to his charge the virgin recommends;
<A NAME="752"></A><BR>His hand with tears th' indulgent father press'd,
<A NAME="753"></A><BR>Then spoke, and thus with tenderness address'd.
<A NAME="754"></A><BR><BR>Since the kind instances of pious love,
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>Do all pretence of obstacle remove;
<A NAME="756"></A><BR>Since Procne's, and her own, with your request,
<A NAME="757"></A><BR>O'er-rule the fears of a paternal breast;
<A NAME="758"></A><BR>With you, dear son, my daughter I entrust,
<A NAME="759"></A><BR>And by the Gods adjure you to be just;
<A NAME="760"></A><BR>By truth, and ev'ry consanguineal tye,
<A NAME="761"></A><BR>To watch, and guard her with a father's eye.
<A NAME="762"></A><BR>And, since the least delay will tedious prove,
<A NAME="763"></A><BR>In keeping from my sight the child I love,
<A NAME="764"></A><BR>With speed return her, kindly to asswage
<A NAME="765"></A><BR>The tedious troubles of my lingring age.
<A NAME="766"></A><BR>And you, my Philomel, let it suffice,
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>To know your sister's banish'd from my eyes;
<A NAME="768"></A><BR>If any sense of duty sways your mind,
<A NAME="769"></A><BR>Let me from you the shortest absence find.
<A NAME="770"></A><BR>He wept; then kiss'd his child; and while he speaks,
<A NAME="771"></A><BR>The tears fall gently down his aged cheeks.
<A NAME="772"></A><BR>Next, as a pledge of fealty, he demands,
<A NAME="773"></A><BR>And, with a solemn charge, conjoyns their hands;
<A NAME="774"></A><BR>Then to his daughter, and his grandson sends,
<A NAME="775"></A><BR>And by their mouth a blessing recommends;
<A NAME="776"></A><BR>While, in a voice with dire forebodings broke,
<A NAME="777"></A><BR>Sobbing, and faint, the last farewel was spoke.
<A NAME="778"></A><BR><BR>Now Philomela, scarce receiv'd on board,
<A NAME="779"></A><BR>And in the royal gilded bark secur'd,
<A NAME="780"></A><BR>Beheld the dashes of the bending oar,
<A NAME="781"></A><BR>The ruffled sea, and the receding shore;
<A NAME="782"></A><BR>When strait (his joy impatient of disguise)
<A NAME="783"></A><BR>We've gain'd our point, the rough Barbarian cries;
<A NAME="784"></A><BR>Now I possess the dear, the blissful hour,
<A NAME="785"></A><BR>And ev'ry wish subjected to my pow'r.
<A NAME="786"></A><BR>Transports of lust his vicious thoughts employ,
<A NAME="787"></A><BR>And he forbears, with pain, th' expected joy.
<A NAME="788"></A><BR>His gloting eyes incessantly survey'd
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>The virgin beauties of the lovely maid:
<A NAME="790"></A><BR>As when the bold rapacious bird of Jove,
<A NAME="791"></A><BR>With crooked talons stooping from above,
<A NAME="792"></A><BR>Has snatcht, and carry'd to his lofty nest
<A NAME="793"></A><BR>A captive hare, with cruel gripes opprest;
<A NAME="794"></A><BR>Secure, with fix'd, and unrelenting eyes,
<A NAME="795"></A><BR>He sits, and views the helpless, trembling prize.
<A NAME="796"></A><BR><BR>Their vessels now had made th' intended land,
<A NAME="797"></A><BR>And all with joy descend upon the strand;
<A NAME="798"></A><BR>When the false tyrant seiz'd the princely maid,
<A NAME="799"></A><BR>And to a lodge in distant woods convey'd;
<A NAME="800"></A><BR>Pale, sinking, and distress'd with jealous fears,
<A NAME="801"></A><BR>And asking for her sister all in tears.
<A NAME="802"></A><BR>The letcher, for enjoyment fully bent,
<A NAME="803"></A><BR>No longer now conceal'd his base intent;
<A NAME="804"></A><BR>But with rude haste the bloomy girl deflow'r'd,
<A NAME="805"></A><BR>Tender, defenceless, and with ease o'erpower'd.
<A NAME="806"></A><BR>Her piercing accents to her sire complain,
<A NAME="807"></A><BR>And to her absent sister, but in vain:
<A NAME="808"></A><BR>In vain she importunes, with doleful cries,
<A NAME="809"></A><BR>Each unattentive godhead of the skies.
<A NAME="810"></A><BR>She pants and trembles, like the bleating prey,
<A NAME="811"></A><BR>From some close-hunted wolf just snatch'd away;
<A NAME="812"></A><BR>That still, with fearful horror, looks around,
<A NAME="813"></A><BR>And on its flank regards the bleeding wound.
<A NAME="814"></A><BR>Or, as the tim'rous dove, the danger o'er,
<A NAME="815"></A><BR>Beholds her shining plumes besmear'd with gore,
<A NAME="816"></A><BR>And, tho' deliver'd from the faulcon's claw,
<A NAME="817"></A><BR>Yet shivers, and retains a secret awe.
<A NAME="818"></A><BR><BR>But when her mind a calm reflection shar'd,
<A NAME="819"></A><BR>And all her scatter'd spirits were repair'd:
<A NAME="820"></A><BR>Torn, and disorder'd while her tresses hung,
<A NAME="821"></A><BR>Her livid hands, like one that mourn'd, she wrung;
<A NAME="822"></A><BR>Then thus, with grief o'erwhelm'd her languid eyes,
<A NAME="823"></A><BR>Savage, inhumane, cruel wretch! she cries;
<A NAME="824"></A><BR>Whom not a parent's strict commands could move,
<A NAME="825"></A><BR>Tho' charg'd, and utter'd with the tears of love;
<A NAME="826"></A><BR>Nor virgin innocence, nor all that's due
<A NAME="827"></A><BR>To the strong contract of the nuptial vow:
<A NAME="828"></A><BR>Virtue, by this, in wild confusion's laid,
<A NAME="829"></A><BR>And I compell'd to wrong my sister's bed;
<A NAME="830"></A><BR>Whilst you, regardless of your marriage oath,
<A NAME="831"></A><BR>With stains of incest have defil'd us both.
<A NAME="832"></A><BR>Tho' I deserv'd some punishment to find,
<A NAME="833"></A><BR>This was, ye Gods! too cruel, and unkind.
<A NAME="834"></A><BR>Yet, villain, to compleat your horrid guilt,
<A NAME="835"></A><BR>Stab here, and let my tainted blood be spilt.
<A NAME="836"></A><BR>Oh happy! had it come, before I knew
<A NAME="837"></A><BR>The curs'd embrace of vile perfidious you;
<A NAME="838"></A><BR>Then my pale ghost, pure from incestuous love,
<A NAME="839"></A><BR>Had wander'd spotless thro' th' Elysian grove.
<A NAME="840"></A><BR>But, if the Gods above have pow'r to know,
<A NAME="841"></A><BR>And judge those actions that are done below;
<A NAME="842"></A><BR>Unless the dreaded thunders of the sky,
<A NAME="843"></A><BR>Like me, subdu'd, and violated lye;
<A NAME="844"></A><BR>Still my revenge shall take its proper time,
<A NAME="845"></A><BR>And suit the baseness of your hellish crime.
<A NAME="846"></A><BR>My self, abandon'd, and devoid of shame,
<A NAME="847"></A><BR>Thro' the wide world your actions will proclaim;
<A NAME="848"></A><BR>Or tho' I'm prison'd in this lonely den,
<A NAME="849"></A><BR>Obscur'd, and bury'd from the sight of men,
<A NAME="850"></A><BR>My mournful voice the pitying rocks shall move,
<A NAME="851"></A><BR>And my complainings eccho thro' the grove.
<A NAME="852"></A><BR>Hear me, o Heav'n! and, if a God be there,
<A NAME="853"></A><BR>Let him regard me, and accept my pray'r.
<A NAME="854"></A><BR><BR>Struck with these words, the tyrant's guilty 
<A NAME="855"></A>breast
<A NAME="856"></A><BR>With fear, and anger, was, by turns, possest;
<A NAME="857"></A><BR>Now, with remorse his conscience deeply stung,
<A NAME="858"></A><BR>He drew the faulchion that beside her hung,
<A NAME="859"></A><BR>And first her tender arms behind her bound,
<A NAME="860"></A><BR>Then drag'd her by the hair along the ground.
<A NAME="861"></A><BR>The princess willingly her throat reclin'd,
<A NAME="862"></A><BR>And view'd the steel with a contented mind;
<A NAME="863"></A><BR>But soon her tongue the girding pinchers strain,
<A NAME="864"></A><BR>With anguish, soon she feels the piercing pain:
<A NAME="865"></A><BR>Oh father! father! would fain have spoke,
<A NAME="866"></A><BR>But the sharp torture her intention broke;
<A NAME="867"></A><BR>In vain she tries, for now the blade has cut
<A NAME="868"></A><BR>Her tongue sheer off, close to the trembling root.
<A NAME="869"></A><BR>The mangled part still quiver'd on the ground,
<A NAME="870"></A><BR>Murmuring with a faint imperfect sound:
<A NAME="871"></A><BR>And, as a serpent writhes his wounded train,
<A NAME="872"></A><BR>Uneasy, panting, and possess'd with pain;
<A NAME="873"></A><BR>The piece, while life remain'd, still trembled fast,
<A NAME="874"></A><BR>And to its mistress pointed to the last.
<A NAME="875"></A><BR><BR>Yet, after this so damn'd, and black a deed,
<A NAME="876"></A><BR>Fame (which I scarce can credit) has agreed,
<A NAME="877"></A><BR>That on her rifled charms, still void of shame,
<A NAME="878"></A><BR>He frequently indulg'd his lustful flame,
<A NAME="879"></A><BR>At last he ventures to his Procne's sight,
<A NAME="880"></A><BR>Loaded with guilt, and cloy'd with long delight;
<A NAME="881"></A><BR>There, with feign'd grief, and false, dissembled 
<A NAME="882"></A>sighs,
<A NAME="883"></A><BR>Begins a formal narrative of lies;
<A NAME="884"></A><BR>Her sister's death he artfully declares,
<A NAME="885"></A><BR>Then weeps, and raises credit from his tears.
<A NAME="886"></A><BR>Her vest, with flow'rs of gold embroider'd o'er,
<A NAME="887"></A><BR>With grief distress'd, the mournful matron tore,
<A NAME="888"></A><BR>And a beseeming suit of gloomy sable wore.
<A NAME="889"></A><BR>With cost, an honorary tomb she rais'd,
<A NAME="890"></A><BR>And thus th' imaginary ghost appeas'd.
<A NAME="891"></A><BR>Deluded queen! the fate of her you love,
<A NAME="892"></A><BR>Nor grief, nor pity, but revenge should move.
<A NAME="893"></A><BR><BR>Thro' the twelve signs had pass'd the circling 
<A NAME="894"></A>sun,
<A NAME="895"></A><BR>And round the compass of the Zodiac run;
<A NAME="896"></A><BR>What must unhappy Philomela do,
<A NAME="897"></A><BR>For ever subject to her keeper's view?
<A NAME="898"></A><BR>Huge walls of massy stone the lodge surround,
<A NAME="899"></A><BR>From her own mouth no way of speaking's found.
<A NAME="900"></A><BR>But all our wants by wit may be supply'd,
<A NAME="901"></A><BR>And art makes up, what fortune has deny'd:
<A NAME="902"></A><BR>With skill exact a Phrygian web she strung,
<A NAME="903"></A><BR>Fix'd to a loom that in her chamber hung,
<A NAME="904"></A><BR>Where in-wrought letters, upon white display'd,
<A NAME="905"></A><BR>In purple notes, her wretched case betray'd:
<A NAME="906"></A><BR>The piece, when finish'd, secretly she gave
<A NAME="907"></A><BR>Into the charge of one poor menial slave;
<A NAME="908"></A><BR>And then, with gestures, made him understand,
<A NAME="909"></A><BR>It must be safe convey'd to Procne's hand.
<A NAME="910"></A><BR>The slave, with speed, the queen's apartment sought,
<A NAME="911"></A><BR>And render'd up his charge, unknowing what he brought.
<A NAME="912"></A><BR>But when the cyphers, figur'd in each fold,
<A NAME="913"></A><BR>Her sister's melancholy story told
<A NAME="914"></A><BR>(Strange that she could!) with silence, she survey'd
<A NAME="915"></A><BR>The tragick piece, and without weeping read:
<A NAME="916"></A><BR>In such tumultuous haste her passions sprung,
<A NAME="917"></A><BR>They choak'd her voice, and quite disarm'd her tongue.
<A NAME="918"></A><BR>No room for female tears; the Furies rise,
<A NAME="919"></A><BR>Darting vindictive glances from her eyes;
<A NAME="920"></A><BR>And, stung with rage, she bounds from place to place,
<A NAME="921"></A><BR>While stern revenge sits low'ring in her face.
<A NAME="922"></A><BR><BR>Now the triennial celebration came,
<A NAME="923"></A><BR>Observ'd to Bacchus by each Thracian dame;
<A NAME="924"></A><BR>When, in the privacies of night retir'd,
<A NAME="925"></A><BR>They act his rites, with sacred rapture fir'd:
<A NAME="926"></A><BR>By night, the tinkling cymbals ring around,
<A NAME="927"></A><BR>While the shrill notes from Rhodope resound;
<A NAME="928"></A><BR>By night, the queen, disguis'd, forsakes the court,
<A NAME="929"></A><BR>To mingle in the festival resort.
<A NAME="930"></A><BR>Leaves of the curling vine her temples shade,
<A NAME="931"></A><BR>And, with a circling wreath, adorn her head:
<A NAME="932"></A><BR>Adown her back the stag's rough spoils appear,
<A NAME="933"></A><BR>Light on her shoulder leans a cornel spear.
<A NAME="934"></A><BR><BR>Thus, in the fury of the God conceal'd,
<A NAME="935"></A><BR>Procne her own mad headstrong passion veil'd;
<A NAME="936"></A><BR>Now, with her gang, to the thick wood she flies,
<A NAME="937"></A><BR>And with religious yellings fills the skies;
<A NAME="938"></A><BR>The fatal lodge, as 'twere by chance, she seeks,
<A NAME="939"></A><BR>And, thro' the bolted doors, an entrance breaks;
<A NAME="940"></A><BR>From thence, her sister snatching by the hand,
<A NAME="941"></A><BR>Mask'd like the ranting Bacchanalian band,
<A NAME="942"></A><BR>Within the limits of the court she drew,
<A NAME="943"></A><BR>Shading, with ivy green, her outward hue.
<A NAME="944"></A><BR>But Philomela, conscious of the place,
<A NAME="945"></A><BR>Felt new reviving pangs of her disgrace;
<A NAME="946"></A><BR>A shiv'ring cold prevail'd in ev'ry part,
<A NAME="947"></A><BR>And the chill'd blood ran trembling to her heart.
<A NAME="948"></A><BR><BR>Soon as the queen a fit retirement found,
<A NAME="949"></A><BR>Stript of the garlands that her temples crown'd,
<A NAME="950"></A><BR>She strait unveil'd her blushing sister's face,
<A NAME="951"></A><BR>And fondly clasp'd her with a close embrace:
<A NAME="952"></A><BR>But, in confusion lost, th' unhappy maid,
<A NAME="953"></A><BR>With shame dejected, hung her drooping head,
<A NAME="954"></A><BR>As guilty of a crime that stain'd her sister's bed.
<A NAME="955"></A><BR>That speech, that should her injur'd virtue clear,
<A NAME="956"></A><BR>And make her spotless innocence appear,
<A NAME="957"></A><BR>Is now no more; only her hands, and eyes
<A NAME="958"></A><BR>Appeal, in signals, to the conscious skies.
<A NAME="959"></A><BR>In Procne's breast the rising passions boil,
<A NAME="960"></A><BR>And burst in anger with a mad recoil;
<A NAME="961"></A><BR>Her sister's ill-tim'd grief, with scorn, she blames,
<A NAME="962"></A><BR>Then, in these furious words her rage proclaims.
<A NAME="963"></A><BR><BR>Tears, unavailing, but defer our time,
<A NAME="964"></A><BR>The stabbing sword must expiate the crime;
<A NAME="965"></A><BR>Or worse, if wit, on bloody vengeance bent,
<A NAME="966"></A><BR>A weapon more tormenting can invent.
<A NAME="967"></A><BR>O sister! I've prepar'd my stubborn heart,
<A NAME="968"></A><BR>To act some hellish, and unheard-of part;
<A NAME="969"></A><BR>Either the palace to surround with fire,
<A NAME="970"></A><BR>And see the villain in the flames expire;
<A NAME="971"></A><BR>Or, with a knife, dig out his cursed eyes,
<A NAME="972"></A><BR>Or, his false tongue with racking engines seize;
<A NAME="973"></A><BR>Or, cut away the part that injur'd you,
<A NAME="974"></A><BR>And, thro' a thousand wounds, his guilty soul pursue.
<A NAME="975"></A><BR>Tortures enough my passion has design'd,
<A NAME="976"></A><BR>But the variety distracts my mind.
<A NAME="977"></A><BR><BR>A-while, thus wav'ring, stood the furious dame,
<A NAME="978"></A><BR>When Itys fondling to his mother came;
<A NAME="979"></A><BR>From him the cruel fatal hint she took,
<A NAME="980"></A><BR>She view'd him with a stern remorseless look:
<A NAME="981"></A><BR>Ah! but too like thy wicked sire, she said,
<A NAME="982"></A><BR>Forming the direful purpose in her head.
<A NAME="983"></A><BR>At this a sullen grief her voice supprest,
<A NAME="984"></A><BR>While silent passions struggle in her breast.
<A NAME="985"></A><BR><BR>Now, at her lap arriv'd, the flatt'ring boy
<A NAME="986"></A><BR>Salutes his parent with a smiling joy:
<A NAME="987"></A><BR>About her neck his little arms are thrown,
<A NAME="988"></A><BR>And he accosts her in a pratling tone.
<A NAME="989"></A><BR>Then her tempestuous anger was allay'd,
<A NAME="990"></A><BR>And in its full career her vengeance stay'd;
<A NAME="991"></A><BR>While tender thoughts, in spite of passion, rise,
<A NAME="992"></A><BR>And melting tears disarm her threat'ning eyes.
<A NAME="993"></A><BR>But when she found the mother's easy heart,
<A NAME="994"></A><BR>Too fondly swerving from th' intended part;
<A NAME="995"></A><BR>Her injur'd sister's face again she view'd:
<A NAME="996"></A><BR>And, as by turns surveying both she stood,
<A NAME="997"></A><BR>While this fond boy (she said) can thus express
<A NAME="998"></A><BR>The moving accents of his fond address;
<A NAME="999"></A><BR>Why stands my sister of her tongue bereft,
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR>Forlorn, and sad, in speechless silence left?
<A NAME="1001"></A><BR>O Procne, see the fortune of your house!
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR>Such is your fate, when match'd to such a spouse!
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR>Conjugal duty, if observ'd to him,
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR>Would change from virtue, and become a crime;
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR>For all respect to Tereus must debase
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR>The noble blood of great Pandion's race.
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR><BR>Strait at these words, with big resentment fill'd,
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR>Furious her look, she flew, and seiz'd her child;
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR>Like a fell tigress of the savage kind,
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR>That drags the tender suckling of the hind
<A NAME="1011"></A><BR>Thro' India's gloomy groves, where Ganges laves
<A NAME="1012"></A><BR>The shady scene, and rouls his streamy waves.
<A NAME="1013"></A><BR><BR>Now to a close apartment they were come,
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR>Far off retir'd within the spacious dome;
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR>When Procne, on revengeful mischief bent,
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR>Home to his heart a piercing ponyard sent.
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR>Itys, with rueful cries, but all too late,
<A NAME="1018"></A><BR>Holds out his hands, and deprecates his fate;
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR>Still at his mother's neck he fondly aims,
<A NAME="1020"></A><BR>And strives to melt her with endearing names;
<A NAME="1021"></A><BR>Yet still the cruel mother perseveres,
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR>Nor with concern his bitter anguish hears.
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR>This might suffice; but Philomela too
<A NAME="1024"></A><BR>Across his throat a shining curtlass drew.
<A NAME="1025"></A><BR>Then both, with knives, dissect each quiv'ring part,
<A NAME="1026"></A><BR>And carve the butcher'd limbs with cruel art;
<A NAME="1027"></A><BR>Which, whelm'd in boiling cauldrons o'er the fire,
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR>Or turn'd on spits, in steamy smoak aspire:
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR>While the long entries, with their slipp'ry floor,
<A NAME="1030"></A><BR>Run down in purple streams of clotted gore.
<A NAME="1031"></A><BR><BR>Ask'd by his wife to this inhuman feast,
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR>Tereus unknowingly is made a guest:
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR>Whilst she her plot the better to disguise,
<A NAME="1034"></A><BR>Styles it some unknown mystick sacrifice;
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR>And such the nature of the hallow'd rite,
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR>The wife her husband only could invite,
<A NAME="1037"></A><BR>The slaves must all withdraw, and be debarr'd the 
<A NAME="1038"></A>sight.
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR>Tereus, upon a throne of antique state,
<A NAME="1040"></A><BR>Loftily rais'd, before the banquet sate;
<A NAME="1041"></A><BR>And glutton like, luxuriously pleas'd,
<A NAME="1042"></A><BR>With his own flesh his hungry maw appeas'd.
<A NAME="1043"></A><BR>Nay, such a blindness o'er his senses falls,
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR>That he for Itys to the table calls.
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR>When Procne, now impatient to disclose
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR>The joy that from her full revenge arose,
<A NAME="1047"></A><BR>Cries out, in transports of a cruel mind,
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR>Within your self your Itys you may find.
<A NAME="1049"></A><BR>Still, at this puzzling answer, with surprise,
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR>Around the room he sends his curious eyes;
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR>And, as he still inquir'd, and call'd aloud,
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR>Fierce Philomela, all besmear'd with blood,
<A NAME="1053"></A><BR>Her hands with murder stain'd, her spreading hair
<A NAME="1054"></A><BR>Hanging dishevel'd with a ghastly air,
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR>Stept forth, and flung full in the tyrant's face
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR>The head of Itys, goary as it was:
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR>Nor ever so much to use her tongue,
<A NAME="1058"></A><BR>And with a just reproach to vindicate her wrong.
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR><BR>The Thracian monarch from the table flings,
<A NAME="1060"></A><BR>While with his cries the vaulted parlour rings;
<A NAME="1061"></A><BR>His imprecations eccho down to Hell,
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR>And rouze the snaky Furies from their Stygian cell.
<A NAME="1063"></A><BR>One while he labours to disgorge his breast,
<A NAME="1064"></A><BR>And free his stomach from the cursed feast;
<A NAME="1065"></A><BR>Then, weeping o'er his lamentable doom,
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR>He styles himself his son's sepulchral tomb.
<A NAME="1067"></A><BR>Now, with drawn sabre, and impetuous speed,
<A NAME="1068"></A><BR>In close pursuit he drives Pandion's breed;
<A NAME="1069"></A><BR>Whose nimble feet spring with so swift a force
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR>Across the fields, they seem to wing their course.
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR>And now, on real wings themselves they raise,
<A NAME="1072"></A><BR>And steer their airy flight by diff'rent ways;
<A NAME="1073"></A><BR>One to the woodland's shady covert hies,
<A NAME="1074"></A><BR>Around the smoaky roof the other flies;
<A NAME="1075"></A><BR>Whose feathers yet the marks of murder stain,
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR>Where stampt upon her breast, the crimson spots 
<A NAME="1077"></A>remain.
<A NAME="1078"></A><BR>Tereus, through grief, and haste to be reveng'd,
<A NAME="1079"></A><BR>Shares the like fate, and to a bird is chang'd:
<A NAME="1080"></A><BR>Fix'd on his head, the crested plumes appear,
<A NAME="1081"></A><BR>Long is his beak, and sharpen'd like a spear;
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR>Thus arm'd, his looks his inward mind display,
<A NAME="1083"></A><BR>And, to a lapwing turn'd, he fans his way.
<A NAME="1084"></A><BR>Exceeding trouble, for his children's fate,
<A NAME="1085"></A><BR>Shorten'd Pandion's days, and chang'd his date;
<A NAME="1086"></A><BR>Down to the shades below, with sorrow spent,
<A NAME="1087"></A><BR>An earlier, unexpected ghost he went.
<A NAME="1088"></A><BR><BR><B>Boreas in Love</B>
<A NAME="1089"></A><BR><BR>Erechtheus next th' Athenian sceptre sway'd,
<A NAME="1090"></A><BR>Whose rule the state with joynt consent obey'd;
<A NAME="1091"></A><BR>So mix'd his justice with his valour flow'd,
<A NAME="1092"></A><BR>His reign one scene of princely goodness shew'd.
<A NAME="1093"></A><BR>Four hopeful youths, as many females bright,
<A NAME="1094"></A><BR>Sprung from his loyns, and sooth'd him with delight.
<A NAME="1095"></A><BR><BR>Two of these sisters, of a lovelier air,
<A NAME="1096"></A><BR>Excell'd the rest, tho' all the rest were fair.
<A NAME="1097"></A><BR>Procris, to Cephalus in wedlock ty'd,
<A NAME="1098"></A><BR>Bless'd the young silvan with a blooming bride:
<A NAME="1099"></A><BR>For Orithyia Boreas suffer'd pain,
<A NAME="1100"></A><BR>For the coy maid sued long, but sued in vain;
<A NAME="1101"></A><BR>Tereus his neighbour, and his Thracian blood,
<A NAME="1102"></A><BR>Against the match a main objection stood;
<A NAME="1103"></A><BR>Which made his vows, and all his suppliant love,
<A NAME="1104"></A><BR>Empty as air and ineffectual prove.
<A NAME="1105"></A><BR><BR>But when he found his soothing flatt'ries fail,
<A NAME="1106"></A><BR>Nor saw his soft addresses cou'd avail;
<A NAME="1107"></A><BR>Blust'ring with ire, he quickly has recourse
<A NAME="1108"></A><BR>To rougher arts, and his own native force.
<A NAME="1109"></A><BR>'Tis well, he said; such usage is my due,
<A NAME="1110"></A><BR>When thus disguis'd by foreign ways I sue;
<A NAME="1111"></A><BR>When my stern airs, and fierceness I disclaim,
<A NAME="1112"></A><BR>And sigh for love, ridiculously tame;
<A NAME="1113"></A><BR>When soft addresses foolishly I try,
<A NAME="1114"></A><BR>Nor my own stronger remedies apply.
<A NAME="1115"></A><BR>By force and violence I chiefly live,
<A NAME="1116"></A><BR>By them the lowring stormy tempests drive;
<A NAME="1117"></A><BR>In foaming billows raise the hoary deep,
<A NAME="1118"></A><BR>Writhe knotted oaks, and sandy desarts sweep;
<A NAME="1119"></A><BR>Congeal the falling flakes of fleecy snow,
<A NAME="1120"></A><BR>And bruise, with ratling hall, the plains below.
<A NAME="1121"></A><BR>I, and my brother-winds, when joyn'd above,
<A NAME="1122"></A><BR>Thro' the waste champian of the skies we rove,
<A NAME="1123"></A><BR>With such a boist'rous full career engage,
<A NAME="1124"></A><BR>That Heav'n's whole concave thunders at our rage.
<A NAME="1125"></A><BR>While, struck from nitrous clouds, fierce lightnings 
<A NAME="1126"></A>play,
<A NAME="1127"></A><BR>Dart thro' the storm, and gild the gloomy day.
<A NAME="1128"></A><BR>Or when, in subterraneous caverns pent,
<A NAME="1129"></A><BR>My breath, against the hollow Earth, is bent,
<A NAME="1130"></A><BR>The quaking world above, and ghosts below,
<A NAME="1131"></A><BR>My mighty pow'r, by dear experience, know,
<A NAME="1132"></A><BR>Tremble with fear, and dread the fatal blow.
<A NAME="1133"></A><BR>This is the only cure to be apply'd,
<A NAME="1134"></A><BR>Thus to Erechtheus I should be ally'd;
<A NAME="1135"></A><BR>And thus the scornful virgin should be woo'd,
<A NAME="1136"></A><BR>Not by intreaty, but by force subdu'd.
<A NAME="1137"></A><BR><BR>Boreas, in passion, spoke these huffing things,
<A NAME="1138"></A><BR>And, as he spoke, he shook his dreadful wings;
<A NAME="1139"></A><BR>At which, afar the shiv'ring sea was fan'd,
<A NAME="1140"></A><BR>And the wide surface of the distant land:
<A NAME="1141"></A><BR>His dusty mantle o'er the hills he drew,
<A NAME="1142"></A><BR>And swept the lowly vallies, as he flew;
<A NAME="1143"></A><BR>Then, with his yellow wings, embrac'd the maid,
<A NAME="1144"></A><BR>And, wrapt in dusky clouds, far off convey'd.
<A NAME="1145"></A><BR>The sparkling blaze of Love's prevailing fire
<A NAME="1146"></A><BR>Shone brighter as he flew, and flam'd the higher.
<A NAME="1147"></A><BR>And now the God, possess'd of his delight,
<A NAME="1148"></A><BR>To northern Thrace pursu'd his airy flight,
<A NAME="1149"></A><BR>Where the young ravish'd nymph became his bride,
<A NAME="1150"></A><BR>And soon the luscious sweets of wedlock try'd.
<A NAME="1151"></A><BR><BR>Two lovely twins, th' effect of this embrace,
<A NAME="1152"></A><BR>Crown their soft labours, and their nuptials grace;
<A NAME="1153"></A><BR>Who, like their mother, beautiful, and fair,
<A NAME="1154"></A><BR>Their father's strength, and feather'd pinions share:
<A NAME="1155"></A><BR>Yet these, at first, were wanting, as 'tis said,
<A NAME="1156"></A><BR>And after, as they grew, their shoulders spread.
<A NAME="1157"></A><BR>Zethes and Calais, the pretty twins,
<A NAME="1158"></A><BR>Remain'd unfledg'd, while smooth their beardless 
<A NAME="1159"></A>chins;
<A NAME="1160"></A><BR>But when, in time, the budding silver down
<A NAME="1161"></A><BR>Shaded their face, and on their cheeks was grown,
<A NAME="1162"></A><BR>Two sprouting wings upon their shoulders sprung,
<A NAME="1163"></A><BR>Like those in birds, that veil the callow young.
<A NAME="1164"></A><BR>Then as their age advanc'd, and they began
<A NAME="1165"></A><BR>From greener youth to ripen into man,
<A NAME="1166"></A><BR>With Jason's Argonauts they cross'd the seas,
<A NAME="1167"></A><BR>Embark'd in quest of the fam'd golden fleece;
<A NAME="1168"></A><BR>There, with the rest, the first frail vessel try'd,
<A NAME="1169"></A><BR>And boldly ventur'd on the swelling tide.
