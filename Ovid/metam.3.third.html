<A NAME="10"></A><B>The Story of of Cadmus</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>When now Agenor had his daughter lost,
<A NAME="12"></A><BR>He sent his son to search on ev'ry coast;
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>And sternly bid him to his arms restore
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>The darling maid, or see his face no more,
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>But live an exile in a foreign clime;
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>Thus was the father pious to a crime.
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>The restless youth search'd all the world around;
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>But how can Jove in his amours be found?
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>When, tir'd at length with unsuccessful toil,
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>To shun his angry sire and native soil,
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>He goes a suppliant to the Delphick dome;
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>There asks the God what new appointed home
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>Should end his wand'rings, and his toils relieve.
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>The Delphick oracles this answer give.
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><BR>"Behold among the fields a lonely cow,
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>Unworn with yokes, unbroken to the plow;
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>Mark well the place where first she lays her down,
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>There measure out thy walls, and build thy town,
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>And from thy guide Boeotia call the land,
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>In which the destin'd walls and town shall stand."
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR>No sooner had he left the dark abode,
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>Big with the promise of the Delphick God,
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>When in the fields the fatal cow he view'd,
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>Nor gall'd with yokes, nor worn with servitude:
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>Her gently at a distance he pursu'd;
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>And as he walk'd aloof, in silence pray'd
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>To the great Pow'r whose counsels he obey'd.
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>Her way thro' flow'ry Panope she took,
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>And now, Cephisus, cross'd thy silver brook;
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>When to the Heav'ns her spacious front she rais'd,
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>And bellow'd thrice, then backward turning gaz'd
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>On those behind, 'till on the destin'd place
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>She stoop'd, and couch'd amid the rising grass.
<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR>Cadmus salutes the soil, and gladly hails
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>The new-found mountains, and the nameless vales,
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>And thanks the Gods, and turns about his eye
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>To see his new dominions round him lye;
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>Then sends his servants to a neighb'ring grove
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>For living streams, a sacrifice to Jove.
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>O'er the wide plain there rose a shady wood
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>Of aged trees; in its dark bosom stood
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>A bushy thicket, pathless and unworn,
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>O'er-run with brambles, and perplex'd with thorn:
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>Amidst the brake a hollow den was found,
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>With rocks and shelving arches vaulted round.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR>Deep in the dreary den, conceal'd from day,
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>Sacred to Mars, a mighty dragon lay,
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>Bloated with poison to a monstrous size;
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>Fire broke in flashes when he glanc'd his eyes:
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>His tow'ring crest was glorious to behold,
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>His shoulders and his sides were scal'd with gold;
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>Three tongues he brandish'd when he charg'd his 
<A NAME="63"></A>foes;
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>His teeth stood jaggy in three dreadful rowes.
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>The Tyrians in the den for water sought,
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>And with their urns explor'd the hollow vault:
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>From side to side their empty urns rebound,
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>And rowse the sleeping serpent with the sound.
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>Strait he bestirs him, and is seen to rise;
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>And now with dreadful hissings fills the skies,
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>And darts his forky tongues, and rowles his glaring 
<A NAME="72"></A>eyes.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>The Tyrians drop their vessels in the fright,
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>All pale and trembling at the hideous sight.
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>Spire above spire uprear'd in air he stood,
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>And gazing round him over-look'd the wood:
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>Then floating on the ground in circles rowl'd;
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>Then leap'd upon them in a mighty fold.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>Of such a bulk, and such a monstrous size
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>The serpent in the polar circle lyes,
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>That stretches over half the northern skies.
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>In vain the Tyrians on their arms rely,
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>In vain attempt to fight, in vain to fly:
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>All their endeavours and their hopes are vain;
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>Some die entangled in the winding train;
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>Some are devour'd, or feel a loathsom death,
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>Swoln up with blasts of pestilential breath.
<A NAME="88"></A><BR><BR>And now the scorching sun was mounted high,
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>In all its lustre, to the noon-day sky;
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>When, anxious for his friends, and fill'd with cares,
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>To search the woods th' impatient chief prepares.
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>A lion's hide around his loins he wore,
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>The well poiz'd javelin to the field he bore,
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>Inur'd to blood; the far-destroying dart;
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>And, the best weapon, an undaunted heart.
<A NAME="96"></A><BR><BR>Soon as the youth approach'd the fatal place,
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>He saw his servants breathless on the grass;
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>The scaly foe amid their corps he view'd,
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>Basking at ease, and feasting in their blood.
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>"Such friends," he cries, "deserv'd a longer date;
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>But Cadmus will revenge or share their fate."
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>Then heav'd a stone, and rising to the throw,
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>He sent it in a whirlwind at the foe:
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>A tow'r, assaulted by so rude a stroke,
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>With all its lofty battlements had shook;
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>But nothing here th' unwieldy rock avails,
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>Rebounding harmless from the plaited scales,
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>That, firmly join'd, preserv'd him from a wound,
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>With native armour crusted all around.
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>With more success, the dart unerring flew,
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>Which at his back the raging warriour threw;
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>Amid the plaited scales it took its course,
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>And in the spinal marrow spent its force.
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>The monster hiss'd aloud, and rag'd in vain,
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>And writh'd his body to and fro with pain;
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>He bit the dart, and wrench'd the wood away;
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>The point still buried in the marrow lay.
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>And now his rage, increasing with his pain,
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>Reddens his eyes, and beats in ev'ry vein;
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>Churn'd in his teeth the foamy venom rose,
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>Whilst from his mouth a blast of vapours flows,
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>Such as th' infernal Stygian waters cast.
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>The plants around him wither in the blast.
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>Now in a maze of rings he lies enrowl'd,
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>Now all unravel'd, and without a fold;
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>Now, like a torrent, with a mighty force
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>Bears down the forest in his boist'rous course.
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>Cadmus gave back, and on the lion's spoil
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>Sustain'd the shock, then forc'd him to recoil;
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>The pointed jav'lin warded off his rage:
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>Mad with his pains, and furious to engage,
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>The serpent champs the steel, and bites the spear,
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>'Till blood and venom all the point besmear.
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>But still the hurt he yet receiv'd was slight;
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>For, whilst the champion with redoubled might
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>Strikes home the jav'lin, his retiring foe
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>Shrinks from the wound, and disappoints the blow.
<A NAME="138"></A><BR><BR>The dauntless heroe still pursues his stroke,
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>And presses forward, 'till a knotty oak
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>Retards his foe, and stops him in the rear;
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>Full in his throat he plung'd the fatal spear,
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>That in th' extended neck a passage found,
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>And pierc'd the solid timber through the wound.
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>Fix'd to the reeling trunk, with many a stroke
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>Of his huge tail he lash'd the sturdy oak;
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>'Till spent with toil, and lab'ring hard for breath,
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>He now lay twisting in the pangs of death.
<A NAME="148"></A><BR><BR>Cadmus beheld him wallow in a flood
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>Of swimming poison, intermix'd with blood;
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>When suddenly a speech was heard from high
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>(The speech was heard, nor was the speaker nigh),
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>"Why dost thou thus with secret pleasure see,
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>Insulting man! what thou thy self shalt be?"
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>Astonish'd at the voice, he stood amaz'd,
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>And all around with inward horror gaz'd:
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>When Pallas swift descending from the skies,
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>Pallas, the guardian of the bold and wise,
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>Bids him plow up the field, and scatter round
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>The dragon's teeth o'er all the furrow'd ground;
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>Then tells the youth how to his wond'ring eyes
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>Embattled armies from the field should rise.
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR>He sows the teeth at Pallas's command,
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>And flings the future people from his hand.
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>The clods grow warm, and crumble where he sows;
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>And now the pointed spears advance in rows;
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>Now nodding plumes appear, and shining crests,
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>Now the broad shoulders and the rising breasts;
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>O'er all the field the breathing harvest swarms,
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>A growing host, a crop of men and arms.
<A NAME="170"></A><BR><BR>So through the parting stage a figure rears
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>Its body up, and limb by limb appears
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>By just degrees; 'till all the man arise,
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>And in his full proportion strikes the eyes.
<A NAME="174"></A><BR><BR>Cadmus surpriz'd, and startled at the sight
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>Of his new foes, prepar'd himself for fight:
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>When one cry'd out, "Forbear, fond man, forbear
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>To mingle in a blind promiscuous war."
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>This said, he struck his brother to the ground,
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>Himself expiring by another's wound;
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>Nor did the third his conquest long survive,
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>Dying ere scarce he had begun to live.
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>The dire example ran through all the field,
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>'Till heaps of brothers were by brothers kill'd;
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>The furrows swam in blood: and only five
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>Of all the vast increase were left alive.
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>Echion one, at Pallas's command,
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>Let fall the guiltless weapon from his hand,
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>And with the rest a peaceful treaty makes,
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>Whom Cadmus as his friends and partners takes;
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>So founds a city on the promis'd earth,
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>And gives his new Boeotian empire birth.
<A NAME="192"></A><BR><BR>Here Cadmus reign'd; and now one would have 
<A NAME="193"></A>guess'd
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>The royal founder in his exile blest:
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>Long did he live within his new abodes,
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>Ally'd by marriage to the deathless Gods;
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>And, in a fruitful wife's embraces old,
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>A long increase of children's children told:
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>But no frail man, however great or high,
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>Can be concluded blest before he die.
<A NAME="201"></A><BR><BR>Actaeon was the first of all his race,
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>Who griev'd his grandsire in his borrow'd face;
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>Condemn'd by stern Diana to bemoan
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>The branching horns, and visage not his own;
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>To shun his once lov'd dogs, to bound away,
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>And from their huntsman to become their prey,
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>And yet consider why the change was wrought,
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>You'll find it his misfortune, not his fault;
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>Or, if a fault, it was the fault of chance:
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>For how can guilt proceed from ignorance?
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR><B>The Transformation of Actaeon into a Stag</B>
<A NAME="212"></A><BR><BR>In a fair chace a shady mountain stood,
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>Well stor'd with game, and mark'd with trails of 
<A NAME="214"></A>blood;
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>Here did the huntsmen, 'till the heat of day,
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>Pursue the stag, and load themselves with rey:
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>When thus Actaeon calling to the rest:
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>"My friends," said he, "our sport is at the best,
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>The sun is high advanc'd, and downward sheds
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>His burning beams directly on our heads;
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>Then by consent abstain from further spoils,
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>Call off the dogs, and gather up the toils,
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>And ere to-morrow's sun begins his race,
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>Take the cool morning to renew the chace."
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>They all consent, and in a chearful train
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>The jolly huntsmen, loaden with the slain,
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>Return in triumph from the sultry plain.
<A NAME="228"></A><BR><BR>Down in a vale with pine and cypress clad,
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>Refresh'd with gentle winds, and brown with shade,
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>The chaste Diana's private haunt, there stood
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>Full in the centre of the darksome wood
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>A spacious grotto, all around o'er-grown
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>With hoary moss, and arch'd with pumice-stone.
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>From out its rocky clefts the waters flow,
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>And trickling swell into a lake below.
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>Nature had ev'ry where so plaid her part,
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>That ev'ry where she seem'd to vie with art.
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>Here the bright Goddess, toil'd and chaf'd with 
<A NAME="239"></A>heat,
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>Was wont to bathe her in the cool retreat.
<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR>Here did she now with all her train resort,
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>Panting with heat, and breathless from the sport;
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>Her armour-bearer laid her bow aside,
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>Some loos'd her sandals, some her veil unty'd;
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>Each busy nymph her proper part undrest;
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>While Crocale, more handy than the rest,
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>Gather'd her flowing hair, and in a noose
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>Bound it together, whilst her own hung loose.
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>Five of the more ignoble sort by turns
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>Fetch up the water, and unlade the urns.
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR>Now all undrest the shining Goddess stood,
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>When young Actaeon, wilder'd in the wood,
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>To the cool grott by his hard fate betray'd,
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>The fountains fill'd with naked nymphs survey'd.
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>The frighted virgins shriek'd at the surprize
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>(The forest echo'd with their piercing cries).
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>Then in a huddle round their Goddess prest:
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>She, proudly eminent above the rest,
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>With blushes glow'd; such blushes as adorn
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>The ruddy welkin, or the purple morn;
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>And tho' the crowding nymphs her body hide,
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>Half backward shrunk, and view'd him from a side.
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>Surpriz'd, at first she would have snatch'd her 
<A NAME="264"></A>bow,
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>But sees the circling waters round her flow;
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>These in the hollow of her hand she took,
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>And dash'd 'em in his face, while thus she spoke:
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>"Tell, if thou can'st, the wond'rous sight disclos'd,
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>A Goddess naked to thy view expos'd."
<A NAME="270"></A><BR><BR>This said, the man begun to disappear
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>By slow degrees, and ended in a deer.
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>A rising horn on either brow he wears,
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>And stretches out his neck, and pricks his ears;
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>Rough is his skin, with sudden hairs o'er-grown,
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>His bosom pants with fears before unknown:
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>Transform'd at length, he flies away in haste,
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>And wonders why he flies away so fast.
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>But as by chance, within a neighb'ring brook,
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>He saw his branching horns and alter'd look.
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>Wretched Actaeon! in a doleful tone
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>He try'd to speak, but only gave a groan;
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>And as he wept, within the watry glass
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>He saw the big round drops, with silent pace,
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>Run trickling down a savage hairy face.
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>What should he do? Or seek his old abodes,
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>Or herd among the deer, and sculk in woods!
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>Here shame dissuades him, there his fear prevails,
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>And each by turns his aking heart assails.
<A NAME="289"></A><BR><BR>As he thus ponders, he behind him spies
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>His op'ning hounds, and now he hears their cries:
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>A gen'rous pack, or to maintain the chace,
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>Or snuff the vapour from the scented grass.
<A NAME="293"></A><BR><BR>He bounded off with fear, and swiftly ran
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>O'er craggy mountains, and the flow'ry plain;
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>Through brakes and thickets forc'd his way, and 
<A NAME="296"></A>flew
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>Through many a ring, where once he did pursue.
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>In vain he oft endeavour'd to proclaim
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>His new misfortune, and to tell his name;
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>Nor voice nor words the brutal tongue supplies;
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>From shouting men, and horns, and dogs he flies,
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>Deafen'd and stunn'd with their promiscuous cries.
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>When now the fleetest of the pack, that prest
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>Close at his heels, and sprung before the rest,
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>Had fasten'd on him, straight another pair,
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>Hung on his wounded haunch, and held him there,
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>'Till all the pack came up, and ev'ry hound
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>Tore the sad huntsman grov'ling on the ground,
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>Who now appear'd but one continu'd wound.
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>With dropping tears his bitter fate he moans,
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>And fills the mountain with his dying groans.
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>His servants with a piteous look he spies,
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>And turns about his supplicating eyes.
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>His servants, ignorant of what had chanc'd,
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>With eager haste and joyful shouts advanc'd,
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>And call'd their lord Actaeon to the game.
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>He shook his head in answer to the name;
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>He heard, but wish'd he had indeed been gone,
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>Or only to have stood a looker-on.
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>But to his grief he finds himself too near,
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>And feels his rav'nous dogs with fury tear
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>Their wretched master panting in a deer.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR><BR><B>The Birth of Bacchus</B>
<A NAME="324"></A><BR><BR>Actaeon's suff'rings, and Diana's rage,
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>Did all the thoughts of men and Gods engage;
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>Some call'd the evils which Diana wrought,
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>Too great, and disproportion'd to the fault:
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>Others again, esteem'd Actaeon's woes
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>Fit for a virgin Goddess to impose.
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>The hearers into diff'rent parts divide,
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>And reasons are produc'd on either side.
<A NAME="332"></A><BR><BR>Juno alone, of all that heard the news,
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>Nor would condemn the Goddess, nor excuse:
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>She heeded not the justice of the deed,
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>But joy'd to see the race of Cadmus bleed;
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>For still she kept Europa in her mind,
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>And, for her sake, detested all her kind.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>Besides, to aggravate her hate, she heard
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>How Semele, to Jove's embrace preferr'd,
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>Was now grown big with an immortal load,
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>And carry'd in her womb a future God.
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>Thus terribly incens'd, the Goddess broke
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>To sudden fury, and abruptly spoke.
<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR>"Are my reproaches of so small a force?
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>'Tis time I then pursue another course:
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>It is decreed the guilty wretch shall die,
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>If I'm indeed the mistress of the sky,
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>If rightly styl'd among the Pow'rs above
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>The wife and sister of the thund'ring Jove
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>(And none can sure a sister's right deny);
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>It is decreed the guilty wretch shall die.
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>She boasts an honour I can hardly claim,
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>Pregnant she rises to a mother's name;
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>While proud and vain she triumphs in her Jove,
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>And shows the glorious tokens of his love:
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>But if I'm still the mistress of the skies,
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>By her own lover the fond beauty dies."
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>This said, descending in a yellow cloud,
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>Before the gates of Semele she stood.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR>Old Beroe's decrepit shape she wears,
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>Her wrinkled visage, and her hoary hairs;
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>Whilst in her trembling gait she totters on,
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>And learns to tattle in the nurse's tone.
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>The Goddess, thus disguis'd in age, beguil'd
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>With pleasing stories her false foster-child.
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>Much did she talk of love, and when she came
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>To mention to the nymph her lover's name,
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>Fetching a sigh, and holding down her head,
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>"'Tis well," says she, "if all be true that's said.
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>But trust me, child, I'm much inclin'd to fear
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>Some counterfeit in this your Jupiter:
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>Many an honest well-designing maid
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>Has been by these pretended Gods betray'd,
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>But if he be indeed the thund'ring Jove,
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>Bid him, when next he courts the rites of love,
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>Descend triumphant from th' etherial sky,
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>In all the pomp of his divinity,
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>Encompass'd round by those celestial charms,
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>With which he fills th' immortal Juno's arms."
<A NAME="380"></A><BR><BR>Th' unwary nymph, ensnar'd with what she said,
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>Desir'd of Jove, when next he sought her bed,
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>To grant a certain gift which she would chuse;
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>"Fear not," reply'd the God, "that I'll refuse
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>Whate'er you ask: may Styx confirm my voice,
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>Chuse what you will, and you shall have your choice."
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>"Then," says the nymph, "when next you seek my arms,
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>May you descend in those celestial charms,
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>With which your Juno's bosom you enflame,
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>And fill with transport Heav'n's immortal dame."
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>The God surpriz'd would fain have stopp'd her voice,
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>But he had sworn, and she had made her choice.
<A NAME="392"></A><BR><BR>To keep his promise he ascends, and shrowds
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>His awful brow in whirl-winds and in clouds;
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>Whilst all around, in terrible array,
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>His thunders rattle, and his light'nings play.
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>And yet, the dazling lustre to abate,
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>He set not out in all his pomp and state,
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>Clad in the mildest light'ning of the skies,
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>And arm'd with thunder of the smallest size:
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>Not those huge bolts, by which the giants slain
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>Lay overthrown on the Phlegrean plain.
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>'Twas of a lesser mould, and lighter weight;
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>They call it thunder of a second-rate,
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>For the rough Cyclops, who by Jove's command
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>Temper'd the bolt, and turn'd it to his hand,
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>Work'd up less flame and fury in its make,
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>And quench'd it sooner in the standing lake.
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>Thus dreadfully adorn'd, with horror bright,
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>Th' illustrious God, descending from his height,
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>Came rushing on her in a storm of light.
<A NAME="411"></A><BR><BR>The mortal dame, too feeble to engage
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>The lightning's flashes, and the thunder's rage,
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>Consum'd amidst the glories she desir'd,
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>And in the terrible embrace expir'd.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR><BR>But, to preserve his offspring from the tomb,
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>Jove took him smoaking from the blasted womb:
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>And, if on ancient tales we may rely,
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>Inclos'd th' abortive infant in his thigh.
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>Here when the babe had all his time fulfill'd,
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>Ino first took him for her foster-child;
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>Then the Niseans, in their dark abode,
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>Nurs'd secretly with milk the thriving God.
<A NAME="423"></A><BR><BR><B>The Transformation of Tiresias</B>
<A NAME="424"></A><BR><BR>'Twas now, while these transactions past on 
<A NAME="425"></A>Earth,
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>And Bacchus thus procur'd a second birth,
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>When Jove, dispos'd to lay aside the weight
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>Of publick empire and the cares of state,
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>As to his queen in nectar bowls he quaff'd,
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>"In troth," says he, and as he spoke he laugh'd,
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>"The sense of pleasure in the male is far
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>More dull and dead, than what you females share."
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>Juno the truth of what was said deny'd;
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>Tiresias therefore must the cause decide,
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>For he the pleasure of each sex had try'd.
<A NAME="436"></A><BR><BR>It happen'd once, within a shady wood,
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>Two twisted snakes he in conjunction view'd,
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>When with his staff their slimy folds he broke,
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>And lost his manhood at the fatal stroke.
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>But, after seven revolving years, he view'd
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>The self-same serpents in the self-same wood:
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>"And if," says he, "such virtue in you lye,
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>That he who dares your slimy folds untie
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>Must change his kind, a second stroke I'll try."
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>Again he struck the snakes, and stood again
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>New-sex'd, and strait recover'd into man.
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>Him therefore both the deities create
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>The sov'raign umpire, in their grand debate;
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>And he declar'd for Jove: when Juno fir'd,
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>More than so trivial an affair requir'd,
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>Depriv'd him, in her fury, of his sight,
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>And left him groping round in sudden night.
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>But Jove (for so it is in Heav'n decreed,
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>That no one God repeal another's deed)
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>Irradiates all his soul with inward light,
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>And with the prophet's art relieves the want of 
<A NAME="457"></A>sight.
<A NAME="458"></A><BR><BR><B>The Transformation of Echo</B>
<A NAME="459"></A><BR><BR>Fam'd far and near for knowing things to come,
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>From him th' enquiring nations sought their doom;
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>The fair Liriope his answers try'd,
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>And first th' unerring prophet justify'd.
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>This nymph the God Cephisus had abus'd,
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>With all his winding waters circumfus'd,
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>And on the Nereid got a lovely boy,
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>Whom the soft maids ev'n then beheld with joy.
<A NAME="467"></A><BR><BR>The tender dame, sollicitous to know
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>Whether her child should reach old age or no,
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>Consults the sage Tiresias, who replies,
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>"If e'er he knows himself he surely dies."
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>Long liv'd the dubious mother in suspence,
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>'Till time unriddled all the prophet's sense.
<A NAME="473"></A><BR><BR>Narcissus now his sixteenth year began,
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>Just turn'd of boy, and on the verge of man;
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>Many a friend the blooming youth caress'd,
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>Many a love-sick maid her flame confess'd:
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>Such was his pride, in vain the friend caress'd,
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>The love-sick maid in vain her flame confess'd.
<A NAME="479"></A><BR><BR>Once, in the woods, as he pursu'd the chace,
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>The babbling Echo had descry'd his face;
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>She, who in others' words her silence breaks,
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>Nor speaks her self but when another speaks.
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>Echo was then a maid, of speech bereft,
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>Of wonted speech; for tho' her voice was left,
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>Juno a curse did on her tongue impose,
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>To sport with ev'ry sentence in the close.
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>Full often when the Goddess might have caught
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>Jove and her rivals in the very fault,
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>This nymph with subtle stories would delay
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>Her coming, 'till the lovers slip'd away.
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>The Goddess found out the deceit in time,
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>And then she cry'd, "That tongue, for this thy crime,
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>Which could so many subtle tales produce,
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>Shall be hereafter but of little use."
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>Hence 'tis she prattles in a fainter tone,
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>With mimick sounds, and accents not her own.
<A NAME="497"></A><BR><BR>This love-sick virgin, over-joy'd to find
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>The boy alone, still follow'd him behind:
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>When glowing warmly at her near approach,
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>As sulphur blazes at the taper's touch,
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>She long'd her hidden passion to reveal,
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>And tell her pains, but had not words to tell:
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>She can't begin, but waits for the rebound,
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>To catch his voice, and to return the sound.
<A NAME="505"></A><BR><BR>The nymph, when nothing could Narcissus move,
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>Still dash'd with blushes for her slighted love,
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>Liv'd in the shady covert of the woods,
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>In solitary caves and dark abodes;
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>Where pining wander'd the rejected fair,
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>'Till harrass'd out, and worn away with care,
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>The sounding skeleton, of blood bereft,
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>Besides her bones and voice had nothing left.
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>Her bones are petrify'd, her voice is found
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>In vaults, where still it doubles ev'ry sound.
<A NAME="515"></A><BR><BR><B>The Story of Narcissus</B>
<A NAME="516"></A><BR><BR>Thus did the nymphs in vain caress the boy,
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>He still was lovely, but he still was coy;
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>When one fair virgin of the slighted train
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>Thus pray'd the Gods, provok'd by his disdain,
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>"Oh may he love like me, and love like me in vain!"
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>Rhamnusia pity'd the neglected fair,
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>And with just vengeance answer'd to her pray'r.
<A NAME="523"></A><BR><BR>There stands a fountain in a darksom wood,
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>Nor stain'd with falling leaves nor rising mud;
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>Untroubled by the breath of winds it rests,
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>Unsully'd by the touch of men or beasts;
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>High bow'rs of shady trees above it grow,
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>And rising grass and chearful greens below.
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>Pleas'd with the form and coolness of the place,
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>And over-heated by the morning chace,
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>Narcissus on the grassie verdure lyes:
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>But whilst within the chrystal fount he tries
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>To quench his heat, he feels new heats arise.
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>For as his own bright image he survey'd,
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>He fell in love with the fantastick shade;
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>And o'er the fair resemblance hung unmov'd,
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>Nor knew, fond youth! it was himself he lov'd.
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>The well-turn'd neck and shoulders he descries,
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>The spacious forehead, and the sparkling eyes;
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>The hands that Bacchus might not scorn to show,
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>And hair that round Apollo's head might flow;
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>With all the purple youthfulness of face,
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>That gently blushes in the wat'ry glass.
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>By his own flames consum'd the lover lyes,
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>And gives himself the wound by which he dies.
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>To the cold water oft he joins his lips,
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>Oft catching at the beauteous shade he dips
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>His arms, as often from himself he slips.
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>Nor knows he who it is his arms pursue
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>With eager clasps, but loves he knows not who.
<A NAME="551"></A><BR><BR>What could, fond youth, this helpless passion 
<A NAME="552"></A>move?
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>What kindled in thee this unpity'd love?
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>Thy own warm blush within the water glows,
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>With thee the colour'd shadow comes and goes,
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>Its empty being on thy self relies;
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>Step thou aside, and the frail charmer dies.
<A NAME="558"></A><BR><BR>Still o'er the fountain's wat'ry gleam he stood,
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>Mindless of sleep, and negligent of food;
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>Still view'd his face, and languish'd as he view'd.
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>At length he rais'd his head, and thus began
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>To vent his griefs, and tell the woods his pain.
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>"You trees," says he, "and thou surrounding grove,
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>Who oft have been the kindly scenes of love,
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>Tell me, if e'er within your shades did lye
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>A youth so tortur'd, so perplex'd as I?
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>I, who before me see the charming fair,
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>Whilst there he stands, and yet he stands not there:
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>In such a maze of love my thoughts are lost:
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>And yet no bulwark'd town, nor distant coast,
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>Preserves the beauteous youth from being seen,
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>No mountains rise, nor oceans flow between.
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>A shallow water hinders my embrace;
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>And yet the lovely mimick wears a face
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>That kindly smiles, and when I bend to join
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>My lips to his, he fondly bends to mine.
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>Hear, gentle youth, and pity my complaint,
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>Come from thy well, thou fair inhabitant.
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>My charms an easy conquest have obtain'd
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>O'er other hearts, by thee alone disdain'd.
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>But why should I despair? I'm sure he burns
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>With equal flames, and languishes by turns.
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>When-e'er I stoop, he offers at a kiss,
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>And when my arms I stretch, he stretches his.
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>His eye with pleasure on my face he keeps,
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>He smiles my smiles, and when I weep he weeps.
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>When e'er I speak, his moving lips appear
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>To utter something, which I cannot hear.
<A NAME="589"></A><BR><BR>"Ah wretched me! I now begin too late
<A NAME="590"></A><BR>To find out all the long-perplex'd deceit;
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>It is my self I love, my self I see;
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>The gay delusion is a part of me.
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>I kindle up the fires by which I burn,
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>And my own beauties from the well return.
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>Whom should I court? how utter my complaint?
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>Enjoyment but produces my restraint,
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>And too much plenty makes me die for want.
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>How gladly would I from my self remove!
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>And at a distance set the thing I love.
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>My breast is warm'd with such unusual fire,
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>I wish him absent whom I most desire.
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>And now I faint with grief; my fate draws nigh;
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>In all the pride of blooming youth I die.
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>Death will the sorrows of my heart relieve.
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>Oh might the visionary youth survive,
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>I should with joy my latest breath resign!
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>But oh! I see his fate involv'd in mine."
<A NAME="608"></A><BR><BR>This said, the weeping youth again return'd
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>To the clear fountain, where again he burn'd;
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>His tears defac'd the surface of the well,
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>With circle after circle, as they fell:
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>And now the lovely face but half appears,
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>O'er-run with wrinkles, and deform'd with tears.
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>"Ah whither," cries Narcissus, "dost thou fly?
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>Let me still feed the flame by which I die;
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>Let me still see, tho' I'm no further blest."
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>Then rends his garment off, and beats his breast:
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>His naked bosom redden'd with the blow,
<A NAME="619"></A><BR>In such a blush as purple clusters show,
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>Ere yet the sun's autumnal heats refine
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>Their sprightly juice, and mellow it to wine.
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>The glowing beauties of his breast he spies,
<A NAME="623"></A><BR>And with a new redoubled passion dies.
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>As wax dissolves, as ice begins to run,
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>And trickle into drops before the sun;
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>So melts the youth, and languishes away,
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>His beauty withers, and his limbs decay;
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>And none of those attractive charms remain,
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>To which the slighted Echo su'd in vain.
<A NAME="630"></A><BR><BR>She saw him in his present misery,
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>Whom, spight of all her wrongs, she griev'd to see.
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>She answer'd sadly to the lover's moan,
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>Sigh'd back his sighs, and groan'd to ev'ry groan:
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>"Ah youth! belov'd in vain," Narcissus cries;
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>"Ah youth! belov'd in vain," the nymph replies.
<A NAME="636"></A><BR>"Farewel," says he; the parting sound scarce fell
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>From his faint lips, but she reply'd, "farewel."
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>Then on th' wholsome earth he gasping lyes,
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>'Till death shuts up those self-admiring eyes.
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>To the cold shades his flitting ghost retires,
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>And in the Stygian waves it self admires.
<A NAME="642"></A><BR><BR>For him the Naiads and the Dryads mourn,
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>Whom the sad Echo answers in her turn;
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>And now the sister-nymphs prepare his urn:
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>When, looking for his corps, they only found
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>A rising stalk, with yellow blossoms crown'd.
<A NAME="647"></A><BR><BR><B>The Story of Pentheus</B>
<A NAME="648"></A><BR><BR>This sad event gave blind Tiresias fame,
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>Through Greece establish'd in a prophet's name.
<A NAME="650"></A><BR><BR>Th' unhallow'd Pentheus only durst deride
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>The cheated people, and their eyeless guide.
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>To whom the prophet in his fury said,
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>Shaking the hoary honours of his head:
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>"'Twere well, presumptuous man, 'twere well for 
<A NAME="655"></A>thee
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>If thou wert eyeless too, and blind, like me:
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>For the time comes, nay, 'tis already here,
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>When the young God's solemnities appear:
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>Which, if thou dost not with just rites adorn,
<A NAME="660"></A><BR>Thy impious carcass, into pieces torn,
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>Shall strew the woods, and hang on ev'ry thorn.
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>Then, then, remember what I now foretel,
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>And own the blind Tiresias saw too well."
<A NAME="664"></A><BR><BR>Still Pentheus scorns him, and derides his skill;
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>But time did all the prophet's threats fulfil.
<A NAME="666"></A><BR>For now through prostrate Greece young Bacchus rode,
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>Whilst howling matrons celebrate the God:
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>All ranks and sexes to his Orgies ran,
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>To mingle in the pomps, and fill the train.
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>When Pentheus thus his wicked rage express'd:
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>"What madness, Thebans, has your souls possess'd?
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>Can hollow timbrels, can a drunken shout,
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>And the lewd clamours of a beastly rout,
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>Thus quell your courage; can the weak alarm
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>Of women's yells those stubborn souls disarm,
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>Whom nor the sword nor trumpet e'er could fright,
<A NAME="677"></A><BR>Nor the loud din and horror of a fight?
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>And you, our sires, who left your old abodes,
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>And fix'd in foreign earth your country Gods;
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>Will you without a stroak your city yield,
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>And poorly quit an undisputed field?
<A NAME="682"></A><BR>But you, whose youth and vigour should inspire
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>Heroick warmth, and kindle martial fire,
<A NAME="684"></A><BR>Whom burnish'd arms and crested helmets grace,
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>Not flow'ry garlands and a painted face;
<A NAME="686"></A><BR>Remember him to whom you stand ally'd:
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>The serpent for his well of waters dy'd.
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>He fought the strong; do you his courage show,
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>And gain a conquest o'er a feeble foe.
<A NAME="690"></A><BR>If Thebes must fall, oh might the fates afford
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>A nobler doom from famine, fire, or sword.
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>Then might the Thebans perish with renown:
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>But now a beardless victor sacks the town;
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>Whom nor the prancing steed, nor pond'rous shield,
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>Nor the hack'd helmet, nor the dusty field,
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>But the soft joys of luxury and ease,
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>The purple vests, and flow'ry garlands please.
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>Stand then aside, I'll make the counterfeit
<A NAME="699"></A><BR>Renounce his god-head, and confess the cheat.
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>Acrisius from the Grecian walls repell'd
<A NAME="701"></A><BR>This boasted pow'r; why then should Pentheus yield?
<A NAME="702"></A><BR>Go quickly drag th' impostor boy to me;
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>I'll try the force of his divinity."
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>Thus did th' audacious wretch those rites profane;
<A NAME="705"></A><BR>His friends dissuade th' audacious wretch in vain:
<A NAME="706"></A><BR>In vain his grandsire urg'd him to give o'er
<A NAME="707"></A><BR>His impious threats; the wretch but raves the more.
<A NAME="708"></A><BR><BR>So have I seen a river gently glide,
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>In a smooth course, and inoffensive tide;
<A NAME="710"></A><BR>But if with dams its current we restrain,
<A NAME="711"></A><BR>It bears down all, and foams along the plain.
<A NAME="712"></A><BR><BR>But now his servants came besmear'd with blood,
<A NAME="713"></A><BR>Sent by their haughty prince to seize the God;
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>The God they found not in the frantick throng,
<A NAME="715"></A><BR>But dragg'd a zealous votary along.
<A NAME="716"></A><BR><BR><B>The Mariners transform'd to Dolphins</B>
<A NAME="717"></A><BR><BR>Him Pentheus view'd with fury in his look,
<A NAME="718"></A><BR>And scarce with-held his hands, whilst thus he spoke:
<A NAME="719"></A><BR>"Vile slave! whom speedy vengeance shall pursue,
<A NAME="720"></A><BR>And terrify thy base seditious crew:
<A NAME="721"></A><BR>Thy country and thy parentage reveal,
<A NAME="722"></A><BR>And, why thou joinest in these mad Orgies, tell."
<A NAME="723"></A><BR><BR>The captive views him with undaunted eyes,
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>And, arm'd with inward innocence, replies,
<A NAME="725"></A><BR><BR>"From high Meonia's rocky shores I came,
<A NAME="726"></A><BR>Of poor descent, Acoetes is my name:
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>My sire was meanly born; no oxen plow'd
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>His fruitful fields, nor in his pastures low'd.
<A NAME="729"></A><BR>His whole estate within the waters lay;
<A NAME="730"></A><BR>With lines and hooks he caught the finny prey,
<A NAME="731"></A><BR>His art was all his livelyhood; which he
<A NAME="732"></A><BR>Thus with his dying lips bequeath'd to me:
<A NAME="733"></A><BR>In streams, my boy, and rivers take thy chance;
<A NAME="734"></A><BR>There swims, said he, thy whole inheritance.
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>Long did I live on this poor legacy;
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>'Till tir'd with rocks, and my old native sky,
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>To arts of navigation I inclin'd;
<A NAME="738"></A><BR>Observ'd the turns and changes of the wind,
<A NAME="739"></A><BR>Learn'd the fit havens, and began to note
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>The stormy Hyades, the rainy Goat,
<A NAME="741"></A><BR>The bright Taygete, and the shining Bears,
<A NAME="742"></A><BR>With all the sailor's catalogue of stars.
<A NAME="743"></A><BR><BR>"Once, as by chance for Delos I design'd,
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>My vessel, driv'n by a strong gust of wind,
<A NAME="745"></A><BR>Moor'd in a Chian Creek; a-shore I went,
<A NAME="746"></A><BR>And all the following night in Chios spent.
<A NAME="747"></A><BR>When morning rose, I sent my mates to bring
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>Supplies of water from a neighb'ring spring,
<A NAME="749"></A><BR>Whilst I the motion of the winds explor'd;
<A NAME="750"></A><BR>Then summon'd in my crew, and went aboard.
<A NAME="751"></A><BR>Opheltes heard my summons, and with joy
<A NAME="752"></A><BR>Brought to the shore a soft and lovely boy,
<A NAME="753"></A><BR>With more than female sweetness in his look,
<A NAME="754"></A><BR>Whom straggling in the neighb'ring fields he took.
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>With fumes of wine the little captive glows,
<A NAME="756"></A><BR>And nods with sleep, and staggers as he goes.
<A NAME="757"></A><BR><BR>"I view'd him nicely, and began to trace
<A NAME="758"></A><BR>Each heav'nly feature, each immortal grace,
<A NAME="759"></A><BR>And saw divinity in all his face,
<A NAME="760"></A><BR>I know not who, said I, this God should be;
<A NAME="761"></A><BR>But that he is a God I plainly see:
<A NAME="762"></A><BR>And thou, who-e'er thou art, excuse the force
<A NAME="763"></A><BR>These men have us'd; and oh befriend our course!
<A NAME="764"></A><BR>Pray not for us, the nimble Dictys cry'd,
<A NAME="765"></A><BR>Dictys, that could the main-top mast bestride,
<A NAME="766"></A><BR>And down the ropes with active vigour slide.
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>To the same purpose old Epopeus spoke,
<A NAME="768"></A><BR>Who over-look'd the oars, and tim'd the stroke;
<A NAME="769"></A><BR>The same the pilot, and the same the rest;
<A NAME="770"></A><BR>Such impious avarice their souls possest.
<A NAME="771"></A><BR>Nay, Heav'n forbid that I should bear away
<A NAME="772"></A><BR>Within my vessel so divine a prey,
<A NAME="773"></A><BR>Said I; and stood to hinder their intent:
<A NAME="774"></A><BR>When Lycabas, a wretch for murder sent
<A NAME="775"></A><BR>From Tuscany, to suffer banishment,
<A NAME="776"></A><BR>With his clench'd fist had struck me over-board,
<A NAME="777"></A><BR>Had not my hands in falling grasp'd a cord.
<A NAME="778"></A><BR><BR>"His base confederates the fact approve;
<A NAME="779"></A><BR>When Bacchus (for 'twas he) begun to move,
<A NAME="780"></A><BR>Wak'd by the noise and clamours which they rais'd;
<A NAME="781"></A><BR>And shook his drowsie limbs, and round him gaz'd:
<A NAME="782"></A><BR>What means this noise? he cries; am I betray'd?
<A NAME="783"></A><BR>Ah, whither, whither must I be convey'd?
<A NAME="784"></A><BR>Fear not, said Proreus, child, but tell us where
<A NAME="785"></A><BR>You wish to land, and trust our friendly care.
<A NAME="786"></A><BR>To Naxos then direct your course, said he;
<A NAME="787"></A><BR>Naxos a hospitable port shall be
<A NAME="788"></A><BR>To each of you, a joyful home to me.
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>By ev'ry God, that rules the sea or sky,
<A NAME="790"></A><BR>The perjur'd villains promise to comply,
<A NAME="791"></A><BR>And bid me hasten to unmoor the ship.
<A NAME="792"></A><BR>With eager joy I launch into the deep;
<A NAME="793"></A><BR>And, heedless of the fraud, for Naxos stand.
<A NAME="794"></A><BR>They whisper oft, and beckon with the hand,
<A NAME="795"></A><BR>And give me signs, all anxious for their prey,
<A NAME="796"></A><BR>To tack about, and steer another way.
<A NAME="797"></A><BR>Then let some other to my post succeed,
<A NAME="798"></A><BR>Said I, I'm guiltless of so foul a deed.
<A NAME="799"></A><BR>What, says Ethalion, must the ship's whole crew
<A NAME="800"></A><BR>Follow your humour, and depend on you?
<A NAME="801"></A><BR>And strait himself he seated at the prore,
<A NAME="802"></A><BR>And tack'd about, and sought another shore.
<A NAME="803"></A><BR><BR>"The beauteous youth now found himself betray'd,
<A NAME="804"></A><BR>And from the deck the rising waves survey'd,
<A NAME="805"></A><BR>And seem'd to weep, and as he wept he said:
<A NAME="806"></A><BR>And do you thus my easy faith beguile?
<A NAME="807"></A><BR>Thus do you bear me to my native isle?
<A NAME="808"></A><BR>Will such a multitude of men employ
<A NAME="809"></A><BR>Their strength against a weak defenceless boy?
<A NAME="810"></A><BR><BR>"In vain did I the God-like youth deplore,
<A NAME="811"></A><BR>The more I begg'd, they thwarted me the more.
<A NAME="812"></A><BR>And now by all the Gods in Heav'n that hear
<A NAME="813"></A><BR>This solemn oath, by Bacchus' self, I swear,
<A NAME="814"></A><BR>The mighty miracle that did ensue,
<A NAME="815"></A><BR>Although it seems beyond belief, is true.
<A NAME="816"></A><BR>The vessel, fix'd and rooted in the flood,
<A NAME="817"></A><BR>Unmov'd by all the beating billows stood.
<A NAME="818"></A><BR>In vain the mariners would plow the main
<A NAME="819"></A><BR>With sails unfurl'd, and strike their oars in vain;
<A NAME="820"></A><BR>Around their oars a twining ivy cleaves,
<A NAME="821"></A><BR>And climbs the mast, and hides the cords in leaves:
<A NAME="822"></A><BR>The sails are cover'd with a chearful green,
<A NAME="823"></A><BR>And berries in the fruitful canvass seen.
<A NAME="824"></A><BR>Amidst the waves a sudden forest rears
<A NAME="825"></A><BR>Its verdant head, and a new Spring appears.
<A NAME="826"></A><BR><BR>"The God we now behold with open'd eyes;
<A NAME="827"></A><BR>A herd of spotted panthers round him lyes
<A NAME="828"></A><BR>In glaring forms; the grapy clusters spread
<A NAME="829"></A><BR>On his fair brows, and dangle on his head.
<A NAME="830"></A><BR>And whilst he frowns, and brandishes his spear,
<A NAME="831"></A><BR>My mates surpriz'd with madness or with fear,
<A NAME="832"></A><BR>Leap'd over board; first perjur'd Madon found
<A NAME="833"></A><BR>Rough scales and fins his stiff'ning sides surround;
<A NAME="834"></A><BR>Ah what, cries one, has thus transform'd thy look?
<A NAME="835"></A><BR>Strait his own mouth grew wider as he spoke;
<A NAME="836"></A><BR>And now himself he views with like surprize.
<A NAME="837"></A><BR>Still at his oar th' industrious Libys plies;
<A NAME="838"></A><BR>But, as he plies, each busy arm shrinks in,
<A NAME="839"></A><BR>And by degrees is fashion'd to a fin.
<A NAME="840"></A><BR>Another, as he catches at a cord,
<A NAME="841"></A><BR>Misses his arms, and, tumbling over-board,
<A NAME="842"></A><BR>With his broad fins and forky tail he laves
<A NAME="843"></A><BR>The rising surge, and flounces in the waves.
<A NAME="844"></A><BR>Thus all my crew transform'd around the ship,
<A NAME="845"></A><BR>Or dive below, or on the surface leap,
<A NAME="846"></A><BR>And spout the waves, and wanton in the deep.
<A NAME="847"></A><BR>Full nineteen sailors did the ship convey,
<A NAME="848"></A><BR>A shole of nineteen dolphins round her play.
<A NAME="849"></A><BR>I only in my proper shape appear,
<A NAME="850"></A><BR>Speechless with wonder, and half dead with fear,
<A NAME="851"></A><BR>'Till Bacchus kindly bid me fear no more.
<A NAME="852"></A><BR>With him I landed on the Chian shore,
<A NAME="853"></A><BR>And him shall ever gratefully adore."
<A NAME="854"></A><BR><BR>"This forging slave," says Pentheus, "would 
<A NAME="855"></A>prevail
<A NAME="856"></A><BR>O'er our just fury by a far-fetch'd tale:
<A NAME="857"></A><BR>Go, let him feel the whips, the swords, the fire,
<A NAME="858"></A><BR>And in the tortures of the rack expire."
<A NAME="859"></A><BR>Th' officious servants hurry him away,
<A NAME="860"></A><BR>And the poor captive in a dungeon lay.
<A NAME="861"></A><BR>But, whilst the whips and tortures are prepar'd,
<A NAME="862"></A><BR>The gates fly open, of themselves unbarr'd;
<A NAME="863"></A><BR>At liberty th' unfetter'd captive stands,
<A NAME="864"></A><BR>And flings the loosen'd shackles from his hands.
<A NAME="865"></A><BR><BR><B>The Death of Pentheus</B>
<A NAME="866"></A><BR><BR>But Pentheus, grown more furious than before,
<A NAME="867"></A><BR>Resolv'd to send his messengers no more,
<A NAME="868"></A><BR>But went himself to the distracted throng,
<A NAME="869"></A><BR>Where high Cithaeron echo'd with their song.
<A NAME="870"></A><BR>And as the fiery war-horse paws the ground,
<A NAME="871"></A><BR>And snorts and trembles at the trumpet's sound;
<A NAME="872"></A><BR>Transported thus he heard the frantick rout,
<A NAME="873"></A><BR>And rav'd and madden'd at the distant shout.
<A NAME="874"></A><BR><BR>A spacious circuit on the hill there stood.
<A NAME="875"></A><BR>Level and wide, and skirted round with wood;
<A NAME="876"></A><BR>Here the rash Pentheus, with unhallow'd eyes,
<A NAME="877"></A><BR>The howling dames and mystick Orgies spies.
<A NAME="878"></A><BR>His mother sternly view'd him where he stood,
<A NAME="879"></A><BR>And kindled into madness as she view'd:
<A NAME="880"></A><BR>Her leafy jav'lin at her son she cast,
<A NAME="881"></A><BR>And cries, "The boar that lays our country waste!
<A NAME="882"></A><BR>The boar, my sisters! Aim the fatal dart,
<A NAME="883"></A><BR>And strike the brindled monster to the heart."
<A NAME="884"></A><BR><BR>Pentheus astonish'd heard the dismal sound,
<A NAME="885"></A><BR>And sees the yelling matrons gath'ring round;
<A NAME="886"></A><BR>He sees, and weeps at his approaching fate,
<A NAME="887"></A><BR>And begs for mercy, and repents too late.
<A NAME="888"></A><BR>"Help, help! my aunt Autonoe," he cry'd;
<A NAME="889"></A><BR>"Remember, how your own Actaeon dy'd."
<A NAME="890"></A><BR>Deaf to his cries, the frantick matron crops
<A NAME="891"></A><BR>One stretch'd-out arm, the other Ino lops.
<A NAME="892"></A><BR>In vain does Pentheus to his mother sue,
<A NAME="893"></A><BR>And the raw bleeding stumps presents to view:
<A NAME="894"></A><BR>His mother howl'd; and, heedless of his pray'r,
<A NAME="895"></A><BR>Her trembling hand she twisted in his hair,
<A NAME="896"></A><BR>"And this," she cry'd, "shall be Agave's share,"
<A NAME="897"></A><BR>When from the neck his struggling head she tore,
<A NAME="898"></A><BR>And in her hands the ghastly visage bore.
<A NAME="899"></A><BR>With pleasure all the hideous trunk survey;
<A NAME="900"></A><BR>Then pull'd and tore the mangled limbs away,
<A NAME="901"></A><BR>As starting in the pangs of death it lay,
<A NAME="902"></A><BR>Soon as the wood its leafy honours casts,
<A NAME="903"></A><BR>Blown off and scatter'd by autumnal blasts,
<A NAME="904"></A><BR>With such a sudden death lay Pentheus slain,
<A NAME="905"></A><BR>And in a thousand pieces strow'd the plain.
<A NAME="906"></A><BR><BR>By so distinguishing a judgment aw'd,
<A NAME="907"></A><BR>The Thebans tremble, and confess the God.
