<A NAME="start"></A>
<A NAME="10"></A><B>The Speeches of Ajax and Ulysses</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>The chiefs were set; the soldiers crown'd the 
<A NAME="12"></A>field:
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>To these the master of the seven-fold shield
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>Upstarted fierce: and kindled with disdain.
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>Eager to speak, unable to contain
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>His boiling rage, he rowl'd his eyes around
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>The shore, and Graecian gallies hall'd a-ground.
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>Then stretching out his hands, O Jove, he cry'd,
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>Must then our cause before the fleet be try'd?
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>And dares Ulysses for the prize contend,
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>In sight of what he durst not once defend?
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>But basely fled that memorable day,
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>When I from Hector's hands redeem'd the flaming 
<A NAME="24"></A>prey.
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>So much 'tis safer at the noisie bar
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>With words to flourish, than ingage in war.
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>By diff'rent methods we maintain our right,
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>Nor am I made to talk, nor he to fight.
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>In bloody fields I labour to be great;
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>His arms are a smooth tongue, and soft deceit:
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>Nor need I speak my deeds, for those you see,
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>The sun, and day are witnesses for me.
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>Let him who fights unseen, relate his own,
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>And vouch the silent stars, and conscious moon.
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>Great is the prize demanded, I confess,
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>But such an abject rival makes it less;
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>That gift, those honours, he but hop'd to gain,
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>Can leave no room for Ajax to be vain:
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>Losing he wins, because his name will be
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>Ennobled by defeat, who durst contend with me.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>Were my known valour question'd, yet my blood
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>Without that plea wou'd make my title good:
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>My sire was Telamon, whose arms, employ'd
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>With Hercules, these Trojan walls destroy'd;
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>And who before with Jason sent from Greece,
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>In the first ship brought home the golden fleece.
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>Great Telamon from Aeacus derives
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>His birth (th' inquisitor of guilty lives
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>In shades below; where Sisyphus, whose son
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>This thief is thought, rouls up the restless heavy 
<A NAME="51"></A>stone),
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>Just Aeacus, the king of Gods above
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>Begot: thus Ajax is the third from Jove.
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>Nor shou'd I seek advantage from my line,
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>Unless (Achilles) it was mix'd with thine:
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>As next of kin, Achilles' arms I claim;
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>This fellow wou'd ingraft a foreign name
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>Upon our stock, and the Sisyphian seed
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>By fraud, and theft asserts his father's breed:
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>Then must I lose these arms, because I came
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>To fight uncall'd, a voluntary name,
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>Nor shunn'd the cause, but offer'd you my aid?
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>While he long lurking was to war betray'd:
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>Forc'd to the field he came, but in the reer;
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>And feign'd distraction to conceal his fear:
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>'Till one more cunning caught him in the snare
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>(Ill for himself); and dragg'd him into war.
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>Now let a hero's arms a coward vest,
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>And he who shunn'd all honours, gain the best:
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>And let me stand excluded from my right,
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>Robb'd of my kinsman's arms, who first appear'd in 
<A NAME="72"></A>fight,
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>Better for us, at home had he remain'd,
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>Had it been true the madness which he feign'd,
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>Or so believ'd; the less had been our shame,
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>The less his counsell'd crime, which brands the Grecian 
<A NAME="77"></A>name;
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>Nor Philoctetes had been left inclos'd
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>In a bare isle, to wants and pains expos'd,
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>Where to the rocks, with solitary groans,
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>His suff'rings, and our baseness he bemoans:
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>And wishes (so may Heav'n his wish fulfill)
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>The due reward to him, who caus'd his ill.
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>Now he, with us to Troy's destruction sworn,
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>Our brother of the war, by whom are born
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>Alcides' arrows, pent in narrow bounds,
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>With cold and hunger pinch'd, and pain'd with wounds,
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>To find him food and cloathing, must employ
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>Against the birds the shafts due to the fate of 
<A NAME="90"></A>Troy.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>Yet still he lives, and lives from treason free,
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>Because he left Ulysses' company;
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>Poor Palamede might wish, so void of aid,
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>Rather to have been left, than so to death betray'd.
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>The coward bore the man immortal spight,
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>Who sham'd him out of madness into fight:
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>Nor daring otherwise to vent his hate,
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>Accus'd him first of treason to the state;
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>And then for proof produc'd the golden store,
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>Himself had hidden in his tent before:
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>Thus of two champions he depriv'd our host,
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>By exile one, and one by treason lost.
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>Thus fights Ulysses, thus his fame extends,
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>A formidable man, but to his friends:
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>Great, for what greatness is in words, and sound,
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>Ev'n faithful Nestor less in both is found:
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>But that he might without a rival reign,
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>He left this faithful Nestor on the plain;
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>Forsook his friend ev'n at his utmost need,
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>Who tir'd, and tardy with his wounded steed,
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>Cry'd out for aid, and call'd him by his name;
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>But cowardice has neither ears nor shame;
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>Thus fled the good old man, bereft of aid,
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>And, for as much as lay in him, betray'd:
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>That this is not a fable forg'd by me,
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>Like one of his, an Ulyssean lie,
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>I vouch ev'n Diomede, who tho' his friend,
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>Cannot that act excuse, much less defend:
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>He call'd him back aloud, and tax'd his fear;
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>And sure enough he heard, but durst not hear.
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR>The Gods with equal eyes on mortal look,
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>He justly was forsaken, who forsook:
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>Wanted that succour, he refus'd to lend,
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>Found ev'ry fellow such another friend:
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>No wonder, if he roar'd that all might hear;
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>His elocution was increas'd by fear:
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>I heard, I ran, I found him out of breath,
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>Pale, trembling, and half dead with fear of death.
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>Though he had judg'd himself by his own laws,
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>And stood condemn'd, I help'd the common cause:
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>With my broad buckler hid him from the foe
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>(Ev'n the shield trembled as he lay below);
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>And from impending Fate the coward freed:
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>Good Heav'n forgive me for so bad a deed!
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>If still he will persist, and urge the strife,
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>First let him give me back his forfeit life:
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>Let him return to that opprobrious field;
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>Again creep under my protecting shield:
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>Let him lie wounded, let the foe be near,
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>And let his quiv'ring heart confess his fear;
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>There put him in the very jaws of Fate;
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>And let him plead his cause in that estate:
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>And yet when snatch'd from death, when from below
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>My lifted shield I loos'd, and let him go;
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>Good Heav'ns, how light he rose, with what a bound
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>He sprung from earth, forgetful of his wound;
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>How fresh, how eager then his feet to ply;
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>Who had not strength to stand, had speed to fly!
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR>Hector came on, and brought the Gods along;
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>Fear seiz'd alike the feeble, and the strong:
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>Each Greek was an Ulysses; such a dread
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>Th' approach, and ev'n the sound of Hector bred:
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>Him, flesh'd with slaughter, and with conquest crown'd,
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>I met, and over-turn'd him to the ground;
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>When after, matchless as he deem'd in might,
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>He challeng'd all our host to single fight;
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>All eyes were fix'd on me: the lots were thrown;
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>But for your champion I was wish'd alone:
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>Your vows were heard; we fought, and neither yield;
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>Yet I return'd unvanquish'd from the field.
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>With Jove to friend, th' insulting Trojan came,
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>And menac'd us with force, our fleet with flame.
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>Was it the strength of this tongue-valiant lord,
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>In that black hour, that sav'd you from the sword?
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>Or was my breast expos'd alone, to brave
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>A thousand swords, a thousand ships to save?
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>The hopes of your return! And can you yield,
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>For a sav'd fleet, less than a single shield?
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>Think it no boast, o Grecians, if I deem
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>These arms want Ajax, more than Ajax them:
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>Or, I with them an equal honour share;
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>They honour'd to be worn, and I to wear.
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>Will he compare my courage with his sleight?
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>As well he may compare the day with night.
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>Night is indeed the province of his reign:
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>Yet all his dark exploits no more contain
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>Than a spy taken, and a sleeper slain;
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>A priest made pris'ner, Pallas made a prey:
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>But none of all these actions done by day:
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>Nor ought of these was done, and Diomede away.
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>If on such petty merits you confer
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>So vast a prize, let each his portion share;
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>Make a just dividend; and if not all,
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>The greater part to Diomede will fall.
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>But why for Ithacus such arms as those,
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>Who naked, and by night invades his foes?
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>The glitt'ring helm by moonlight will proclaim
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>The latent robber, and prevent his game:
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>Nor cou'd he hold his tott'ring head upright
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>Beneath that morion, or sustain the weight;
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>Nor that right arm cou'd toss the beamy lance;
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>Much less the left that ampler shield advance;
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>Pond'rous with precious weight, and rough with cost
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>Of the round world in rising gold emboss'd.
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>That orb would ill become his hand to wield,
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>And look as for the gold he stole the shield;
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>Which, shou'd your error on the wretch bestow,
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>It would not frighten, but allure the foe:
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>Why asks he, what avails him not in fight,
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>And wou'd but cumber, and retard his flight,
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>In which his only excellence is plac'd?
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>You give him death, that intercept his haste.
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>Add, that his own is yet a maiden-shield,
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>Nor the least dint has suffer'd in the field,
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>Guiltless of fight: mine batter'd, hew'd, and bor'd,
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>Worn out of service, must forsake his lord,
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>What farther need of words our right to scan?
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>My arguments are deeds, let action speak the man.
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>Since from a champion's arms the strife arose,
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>Go cast the glorious prize amid the foes;
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>Then send us to redeem both arms, and shield,
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>And let him wear, who wins 'em in the field.
<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR>He said: a murmur from a multitude,
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>Or somewhat like a stifled shout, ensu'd:
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>'Till from his seat arose Laertes' son,
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>Look'd down a while, and paus'd, e'er he begun;
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>Then, to th' expecting audience, rais'd his look,
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>And not without prepar'd attention spoke:
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>Soft was his tone, and sober was his face;
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>Action his words, and words his action grace.
<A NAME="221"></A><BR><BR>If Heav'n, my lords, had heard our common pray'r,
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>These arms had caus'd no quarrel for an heir;
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>Still great Achilles had his own possess'd,
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>And we with great Achilles had been bless'd;
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>But since hard Fate, and Heav'n's severe decree,
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>Have ravish'd him away from you, and me
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>(At this he sigh'd, and wip'd his eyes, and drew,
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>Or seem'd to draw, some drops of kindly dew),
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>Who better can succeed Achilles lost,
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>Than he, who gave Achilles to your hoast?
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>This only I request, that neither he
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>May gain, by being what he seems to be,
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>A stupid thing; nor I may lose the prize,
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>By having sense, which Heav'n to him denies:
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>Since great or small, the talent I enjoy'd
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>Was ever in the common cause employ'd;
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>Nor let my wit, and wonted eloquence,
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>Which often has been us'd in your defense,
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>And in my own, this only time be brought
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>To bear against my self, and deem'd a fault.
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>Make not a crime, where Nature made it none;
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>For ev'ry man may freely use his own.
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>The deeds of long-descended ancestors
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>Are but by grace of imputation ours,
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>Theirs in effect; but since he draws his line
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>From Jove, and seems to plead a right divine;
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>From Jove, like him, I claim my pedigree,
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>And am descended in the same degree:
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>My sire Laertes was Arcesius' heir,
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>Arcesius was the son of Jupiter:
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>No parricide, no banish'd man, is known
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>In all my line: let him excuse his own.
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>Hermes ennobles too my mother's side,
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>By both my parents to the Gods ally'd.
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>But not because that on the female part
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>My blood is better, dare I claim desert,
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>Or that my sire from parricide is free;
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>But judge by merit betwixt him, and me:
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>The prize be to the best; provided yet
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>That Ajax for a while his kin forget,
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>And his great sire, and greater uncle's name,
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>To fortifie by them his feeble claim:
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>Be kindred and relation laid aside,
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>And honour's cause by laws of honour try'd:
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>For if he plead proximity of blood;
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>That empty title is with ease withstood.
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>Peleus, the hero's sire, more nigh than he,
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>And Pyrrhus, his undoubted progeny,
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>Inherit first these trophies of the field;
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>To Scyros, or to Pthia, send the shield:
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>And Teucer has an uncle's right; yet he
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>Waves his pretensions, nor contends with me.
<A NAME="273"></A><BR><BR>Then since the cause on pure desert is plac'd,
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>Whence shall I take my rise, what reckon last?
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>I not presume on ev'ry act to dwell,
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>But take these few, in order as they fell.
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR>Thetis, who knew the Fates, apply'd her care
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>To keep Achilles in disguise from war;
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>And 'till the threatning influence was past,
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>A woman's habit on the hero cast:
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>All eyes were cozen'd by the borrow'd vest,
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>And Ajax (never wiser than the rest)
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>Found no Pelides there: at length I came
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>With proffer'd wares to this pretended dame;
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>She, not discover'd by her mien, or voice,
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>Betray'd her manhood by her manly choice;
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>And while on female toys her fellows look,
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>Grasp'd in her warlike hand, a javelin shook;
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>Whom, by this act reveal'd, I thus bespoke:
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>O Goddess-born! resist not Heav'n's decree,
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>The fall of Ilium is reserv'd for thee;
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>Then seiz'd him, and produc'd in open light,
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>Sent blushing to the field the fatal knight.
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>Mine then are all his actions of the war;
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>Great Telephus was conquer'd by my spear,
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>And after cur'd: to me the Thebans owe,
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>Lesbos, and Tenedos, their overthrow;
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>Syros and Cylla: not on all to dwell,
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>By me Lyrnesus, and strong Chrysa fell:
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>And since I sent the man who Hector slew,
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>To me the noble Hector's death is due:
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>Those arms I put into his living hand,
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>Those arms, Pelides dead, I now demand.
<A NAME="304"></A><BR><BR>When Greece was injur'd in the Spartan prince,
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>And met at Aulis to avenge th' offence,
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>'Twas a dead calm, or adverse blasts, that reign'd,
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>And in the port the wind-bound fleet detain'd:
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>Bad signs were seen, and oracles severe
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>Were daily thunder'd in our gen'ral's ear;
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>That by his daughter's blood we must appease
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>Diana's kindled wrath, and free the seas.
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>Affection, int'rest, fame, his heart assail'd:
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>But soon the father o'er the king prevail'd:
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>Bold, on himself he took the pious crime,
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>As angry with the Gods, as they with him.
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>No subject cou'd sustain their sov'reign's look,
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>'Till this hard enterprize I undertook:
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>I only durst th' imperial pow'r controul,
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>And undermin'd the parent in his soul;
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>Forc'd him t' exert the king for common good,
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>And pay our ransom with his daughter's blood.
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>Never was cause more difficult to plead,
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>Than where the judge against himself decreed:
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>Yet this I won by dint of argument;
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>The wrongs his injur'd brother underwent,
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>And his own office, sham'd him to consent.
<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR>'Tis harder yet to move the mother's mind,
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>And to this heavy task was I design'd:
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>Reasons against her love I knew were vain;
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>I circumvented whom I could not gain:
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>Had Ajax been employ'd, our slacken'd sails
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>Had still at Aulis waited happy gales.
<A NAME="333"></A><BR><BR>Arriv'd at Troy, your choice was fix'd on me,
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>A fearless envoy, fit for a bold embassy:
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>Secure, I enter'd through the hostile court,
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>Glitt'ring with steel, and crowded with resort:
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>There, in the midst of arms, I plead our cause,
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>Urge the foul rape, and violated laws;
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>Accuse the foes, as authors of the strife,
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>Reproach the ravisher, demand the wife.
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>Priam, Antenor, and the wiser few,
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>I mov'd; but Paris, and his lawless crew
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>Scarce held their hands, and lifted swords; but 
<A NAME="344"></A>stood
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>In act to quench their impious thirst of blood:
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>This Menelaus knows; expos'd to share
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>With me the rough preludium of the war.
<A NAME="348"></A><BR><BR>Endless it were to tell, what I have done,
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>In arms, or council, since the siege begun:
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>The first encounter's past, the foe repell'd,
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>They skulk'd within the town, we kept the field.
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>War seem'd asleep for nine long years; at length
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>Both sides resolv'd to push, we try'd our strength
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>Now what did Ajax, while our arms took breath,
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>Vers'd only in the gross mechanick trade of death?
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>If you require my deeds, with ambush'd arms
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>I trapp'd the foe, or tir'd with false alarms;
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>Secur'd the ships, drew lines along the plain,
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>The fainting chear'd, chastis'd the rebel-train,
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>Provided forage, our spent arms renew'd;
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>Employ'd at home, or sent abroad, the common cause 
<A NAME="362"></A>pursu'd.
<A NAME="363"></A><BR><BR>The king, deluded in a dream by Jove,
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>Despair'd to take the town, and order'd to remove.
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>What subject durst arraign the Pow'r supream,
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>Producing Jove to justifie his dream?
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>Ajax might wish the soldiers to retain
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>From shameful flight, but wishes were in vain:
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>As wanting of effect had been his words,
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>Such as of course his thundring tongue affords.
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>But did this boaster threaten, did he pray,
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>Or by his own example urge their stay?
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>None, none of these: but ran himself away.
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>I saw him run, and was asham'd to see;
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>Who ply'd his feet so fast to get aboard, as he?
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>Then speeding through the place, I made a stand,
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>And loudly cry'd, O base degenerate band,
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>To leave a town already in your hand!
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>After so long expence of blood, for fame,
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>To bring home nothing, but perpetual shame!
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>These words, or what I have forgotten since
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>(For grief inspir'd me then with eloquence),
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>Reduc'd their minds; they leave the crowded port,
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>And to their late forsaken camp resort:
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>Dismay'd the council met: this man was there,
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>But mute, and not recover'd of his fear:
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>Thersites tax'd the king, and loudly rail'd,
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>But his wide opening mouth with blows I seal'd.
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>Then, rising, I excite their souls to fame,
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>And kindle sleeping virtue into flame.
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>From thence, whatever he perform'd in fight
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>Is justly mine, who drew him back from flight.
<A NAME="393"></A><BR><BR>Which of the Grecian chiefs consorts with thee?
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>But Diomede desires my company,
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>And still communicates his praise with me.
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>As guided by a God, secure he goes,
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>Arm'd with my fellowship, amid the foes:
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>And sure no little merit I may boast,
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>Whom such a man selects from such an hoast;
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>Unforc'd by lots I went without affright,
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>To dare with him the dangers of the night:
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>On the same errand sent, we met the spy
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>Of Hector, double-tongu'd, and us'd to lie;
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>Him I dispatch'd, but not 'till undermin'd,
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>I drew him first to tell, what treach'rous Troy 
<A NAME="406"></A>design'd:
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>My task perform'd, with praise I had retir'd,
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>But not content with this, to greater praise aspir'd:
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>Invaded Rhesus, and his Thracian crew,
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>And him, and his, in their own strength I slew;
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>Return'd a victor, all my vows compleat,
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>With the king's chariot, in his royal seat:
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>Refuse me now his arms, whose fiery steeds
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>Were promis'd to the spy for his nocturnal deeds:
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>Yet let dull Ajax bear away my right,
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>When all his days out-balance this one night.
<A NAME="417"></A><BR><BR>Nor fought I darkling still: the sun beheld
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>With slaughter'd Lycians when I strew'd the field:
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>You saw, and counted as I pass'd along,
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>Alastor, Chromius, Ceranos the strong,
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>Alcander, Prytanis, and Halius,
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>Noemon, Charopes, and Ennomus;
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>Coon, Chersidamas; and five beside,
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>Men of obscure descent, but courage try'd:
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>All these this hand laid breathless on the ground;
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>Nor want I proofs of many a manly wound:
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>All honest, all before: believe not me;
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>Words may deceive, but credit what you see.
<A NAME="429"></A><BR><BR>At this he bar'd his breast, and show'd his 
<A NAME="430"></A>scars,
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>As of a furrow'd field, well plow'd with wars;
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>Nor is this part unexercis'd, said he;
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>That gyant-bulk of his from wounds is free:
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>Safe in his shield he fears no foe to try,
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>And better manages his blood, than I:
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>But this avails me not; our boaster strove
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>Not with our foes alone, but partial Jove,
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>To save the fleet: this I confess is true
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>(Nor will I take from any man his due):
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>But thus assuming all, he robs from you.
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>Some part of honour to your share will fall,
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>He did the best indeed, but did not all.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>Patroclus in Achilles' arms, and thought
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>The chief he seem'd, with equal ardour fought;
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>Preserv'd the fleet, repell'd the raging fire,
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>And forc'd the fearful Trojans to retire.
<A NAME="447"></A><BR><BR>But Ajax boasts, that he was only thought
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>A match for Hector, who the combat sought:
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>Sure he forgets the king, the chiefs, and me:
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>All were as eager for the fight, as he:
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>He but the ninth, and not by publick voice,
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>Or ours preferr'd, was only Fortune's choice:
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>They fought; nor can our hero boast th' event,
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>For Hector from the field unwounded went.
<A NAME="455"></A><BR><BR>Why am I forc'd to name that fatal day,
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>That snatch'd the prop and pride of Greece away?
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>I saw Pelides sink, with pious grief,
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>And ran in vain, alas! to his relief;
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>For the brave soul was fled: full of my friend
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>I rush'd amid the war, his relicks to defend:
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>Nor ceas'd my toil, 'till I redeem'd the prey,
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>And, loaded with Achilles, march'd away:
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>Those arms, which on these shoulders then I bore,
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>'Tis just you to these shoulders should restore.
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>You see I want not nerves, who cou'd sustain
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>The pond'rous ruins of so great a man:
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>Or if in others equal force you find,
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>None is endu'd with a more grateful mind.
<A NAME="469"></A><BR><BR>Did Thetis then, ambitious in her care,
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>These arms thus labour'd for her son prepare;
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>That Ajax after him the heav'nly gift shou'd wear!
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>For that dull soul to stare with stupid eyes,
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>On the learn'd unintelligible prize!
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>What are to him the sculptures of the shield,
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>Heav'n's planets, Earth, and Ocean's watry field?
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>The Pleiads, Hyads; less, and greater Bear,
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>Undipp'd in seas; Orion's angry star;
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>Two diff'ring cities, grav'd on either hand;
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>Would he wear arms he cannot understand?
<A NAME="480"></A><BR><BR>Beside, what wise objections he prepares
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>Against my late accession to the wars?
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>Does not the fool perceive his argument
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>Is with more force against Achilles bent?
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>For if dissembling be so great a crime,
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>The fault is common, and the same in him:
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>And if he taxes both of long delay,
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>My guilt is less, who sooner came away.
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>His pious mother, anxious for his life,
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>Detain'd her son; and me, my pious wife.
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>To them the blossoms of our youth were due,
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>Our riper manhood we reserv'd for you.
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>But grant me guilty, 'tis not much my care,
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>When with so great a man my guilt I share:
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>My wit to war the matchless hero brought,
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>But by this fool I never had been caught.
<A NAME="496"></A><BR><BR>Nor need I wonder, that on me he threw
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>Such foul aspersions, when he spares not you:
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>If Palamede unjustly fell by me,
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>Your honour suffer'd in th' unjust decree:
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>I but accus'd, you doom'd: and yet he dy'd,
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>Convinc'd of treason, and was fairly try'd:
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>You heard not he was false; your eyes beheld
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>The traytor manifest; the bribe reveal'd.
<A NAME="504"></A><BR><BR>That Philoctetes is on Lemnos left,
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>Wounded, forlorn, of human aid bereft,
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>Is not my crime, or not my crime alone;
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>Defend your justice, for the fact's your own:
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>'Tis true, th' advice was mine; that staying there
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>He might his weary limbs with rest repair,
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>From a long voyage free, and from a longer war.
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>He took the counsl, and he lives at least;
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>Th' event declares I counsell'd for the best:
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>Though faith is all in ministers of state;
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>For who can promise to be fortunate?
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>Now since his arrows are the Fate of Troy,
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>Do not my wit, or weak address, employ;
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>Send Ajax there, with his persuasive sense,
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>To mollifie the man, and draw him thence:
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>But Xanthus shall run backward; Ida stand
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>A leafless mountain; and the Grecian band
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>Shall fight for Troy; if, when my councils fail,
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>The wit of heavy Ajax can prevail.
<A NAME="523"></A><BR><BR>Hard Philoctetes, exercise thy spleen
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>Against thy fellows, and the king of men;
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>Curse my devoted head, above the rest,
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>And wish in arms to meet me breast to breast:
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>Yet I the dang'rous task will undertake,
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>And either die my self, or bring thee back.
<A NAME="529"></A><BR><BR>Nor doubt the same success, as when before
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>The Phrygian prophet to these tents I bore,
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>Surpriz'd by night, and forc'd him to declare
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>In what was plac'd the fortune of the war,
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>Heav'n's dark decrees, and answers to display,
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>And how to take the town, and where the secret lay:
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>Yet this I compass'd, and from Troy convey'd
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>The fatal image of their guardian-maid;
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>That work was mine; for Pallas, though our friend,
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>Yet while she was in Troy, did Troy defend.
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>Now what has Ajax done, or what design'd?
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>A noisie nothing, and an empty wind.
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>If he be what he promises in show,
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>Why was I sent, and why fear'd he to go?
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>Our boasting champion thought the task not light
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>To pass the guards, commit himself to night;
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>Not only through a hostile town to pass,
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>But scale, with steep ascent, the sacred place;
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>With wand'ring steps to search the cittadel,
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>And from the priests their patroness to steal:
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>Then through surrounding foes to force my way,
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>And bear in triumph home the heavn'ly prey;
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>Which had I not, Ajax in vain had held,
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>Before that monst'rous bulk, his sev'nfold shield.
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>That night to conquer Troy I might be said,
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>When Troy was liable to conquest made.
<A NAME="555"></A><BR><BR>Why point'st thou to my partner of the war?
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>Tydides had indeed a worthy share
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>In all my toil, and praise; but when thy might
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>Our ships protected, did'st thou singly fight?
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>All join'd, and thou of many wert but one;
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>I ask'd no friend, nor had, but him alone:
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>Who, had he not been well assur'd, that art,
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>And conduct were of war the better part,
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>And more avail'd than strength, my valiant friend
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>Had urg'd a better right, than Ajax can pretend:
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>As good at least Eurypilus may claim,
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>And the more mod'rate Ajax of the name:
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>The Cretan king, and his brave charioteer,
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>And Menelaus bold with sword, and spear:
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>All these had been my rivals in the shield,
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>And yet all these to my pretensions yield.
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>Thy boist'rous hands are then of use, when I
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>With this directing head those hands apply.
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>Brawn without brain is thine: my prudent care
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>Foresees, provides, administers the war:
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>Thy province is to fight; but when shall be
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>The time to fight, the king consults with me:
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>No dram of judgment with thy force is join'd:
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>Thy body is of profit, and my mind.
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>By how much more the ship her safety owes
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>To him who steers, than him that only rows;
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>By how much more the captain merits praise,
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>Than he who fights, and fighting but obeys;
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>By so much greater is my worth than thine,
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>Who canst but execute, what I design.
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>What gain'st thou, brutal man, if I confess
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>Thy strength superior, when thy wit is less?
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>Mind is the man: I claim my whole desert,
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>From the mind's vigour, and th' immortal part.
<A NAME="589"></A><BR><BR>But you, o Grecian chiefs, reward my care,
<A NAME="590"></A><BR>Be grateful to your watchman of the war:
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>For all my labours in so long a space,
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>Sure I may plead a title to your grace:
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>Enter the town, I then unbarr'd the gates,
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>When I remov'd their tutelary Fates.
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>By all our common hopes, if hopes they be
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>Which I have now reduc'd to certainty;
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>By falling Troy, by yonder tott'ring tow'rs,
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>And by their taken Gods, which now are ours;
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>Or if there yet a farther task remains,
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>To be perform'd by prudence, or by pains;
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>If yet some desp'rate action rests behind,
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>That asks high conduct, and a dauntless mind;
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>If ought be wanting to the Trojan doom,
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>Which none but I can manage, and o'ercome,
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>Award, those arms I ask, by your decree:
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>Or give to this, what you refuse to me.
<A NAME="607"></A><BR><BR>He ceas'd: and ceasing with respect he bow'd,
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>And with his hand at once the fatal statue show'd.
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>Heav'n, air and ocean rung, with loud applause,
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>And by the gen'ral vote he gain'd his cause.
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>Thus conduct won the prize, when courage fail'd,
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>And eloquence o'er brutal force prevail'd.
<A NAME="613"></A><BR><BR><B>The Death of Ajax</B>
<A NAME="614"></A><BR><BR>He who cou'd often, and alone, withstand
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>The foe, the fire, and Jove's own partial hand,
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>Now cannot his unmaster'd grief sustain,
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>But yields to rage, to madness, and disdain;
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>Then snatching out his fauchion, Thou, said he,
<A NAME="619"></A><BR>Art mine; Ulysses lays no claim to thee.
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>O often try'd, and ever-trusty sword,
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>Now do thy last kind office to thy lord:
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>'Tis Ajax who requests thy aid, to show
<A NAME="623"></A><BR>None but himself, himself cou'd overthrow:
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>He said, and with so good a will to die,
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>Did to his breast the fatal point apply,
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>It found his heart, a way 'till then unknown,
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>Where never weapon enter'd, but his own.
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>No hands cou'd force it thence, so fix'd it stood,
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>'Till out it rush'd, expell'd by streams of spouting 
<A NAME="630"></A>blood.
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>The fruitful blood produc'd a flow'r, which grew
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>On a green stem; and of a purple hue:
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>Like his, whom unaware Apollo slew:
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>Inscrib'd in both, the letters are the same,
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>But those express the grief, and these the name.
<A NAME="636"></A><BR><BR><B>The Story of Polyxena and Hecuba</B>
<A NAME="637"></A><BR><BR>The victor with full sails for Lemnos stood
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>(Once stain'd by matrons with their husbands' blood),
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>Thence great Alcides' fatal shafts to bear,
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>Assign'd to Philoctetes' secret care.
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>These with their guardian to the Greeks convey'd,
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>Their ten years' toil with wish'd success repaid.
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>With Troy old Priam falls: his queen survives;
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>'Till all her woes compleat, transform'd she grieves
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>In borrow'd sounds, nor with an human face,
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>Barking tremendous o'er the plains of Thrace.
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>Still Ilium's flames their pointed columns raise,
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>And the red Hellespont reflects the blaze.
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>Shed on Jove's altar are the poor remains
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>Of blood, which trickl'd from old Priam's veins.
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>Cassandra lifts her hands to Heav'n in vain,
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>Drag'd by her sacred hair; the trembling train
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>Of matrons to their burning temples fly:
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>There to their Gods for kind protection cry;
<A NAME="655"></A><BR>And to their statues cling 'till forc'd away,
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>The victor Greeks bear off th' invidious prey.
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>From those high tow'rs Astyanax is thrown,
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>Whence he was wont with pleasure to look down.
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>When oft his mother with a fond delight
<A NAME="660"></A><BR>Pointed to view his father's rage in fight,
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>To win renown, and guard his country's right.
<A NAME="662"></A><BR><BR>The winds now call to sea; brisk northern gales
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>Sing in the shrowds, and court the spreading sails.
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>Farewel, dear Troy, the captive matrons cry;
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>Yes, we must leave our long-lov'd native sky.
<A NAME="666"></A><BR>Then prostrate on the shore they kiss the sand,
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>And quit the smoking ruines of the land.
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>Last Hecuba on board, sad sight! appears;
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>Found weeping o'er her children's sepulchres:
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>Drag'd by Ulysses from her slaughter'd sons,
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>Whilst yet she graspt their tombs, and kist their mouldring 
<A NAME="672"></A>bones.
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>Yet Hector's ashes from his urn she bore,
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>And in her bosom the sad relique wore:
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>Then scatter'd on his tomb her hoary hairs,
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>A poor oblation mingled with her tears.
<A NAME="677"></A><BR><BR>Oppos'd to Ilium lye the Thracian plains,
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>Where Polymestor safe in plenty reigns.
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>King Priam to his care commits his son,
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>Young Polydore, the chance of war to shun.
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>A wise precaution! had not gold, consign'd
<A NAME="682"></A><BR>For the child's use, debauch'd the tyrant's mind.
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>When sinking Troy to its last period drew,
<A NAME="684"></A><BR>With impious hands his royal charge he slew;
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>Then in the sea the lifeless coarse is thrown;
<A NAME="686"></A><BR>As with the body he the guilt could drown.
<A NAME="687"></A><BR><BR>The Greeks now riding on the Thracian shore,
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>'Till kinder gales invite, their vessels moor.
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>Here the wide-op'ning Earth to sudden view
<A NAME="690"></A><BR>Disclos'd Achilles, great as when he drew
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>The vital air, but fierce with proud disdain,
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>As when he sought Briseis to regain;
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>When stern debate, and rash injurious strife
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>Unsheath'd his sword, to reach Atrides' life.
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>And will ye go? he said. Is then the name
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>Of the once great Achilles lost to fame?
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>Yet stay, ungrateful Greeks; nor let me sue
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>In vain for honours to my Manes due.
<A NAME="699"></A><BR>For this just end, Polyxena I doom
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>With victim-rites to grace my slighted tomb.
<A NAME="701"></A><BR><BR>The phantom spoke; the ready Greeks obey'd,
<A NAME="702"></A><BR>And to the tomb led the devoted maid
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>Snatch'd from her mother, who with pious care
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>Cherish'd this last relief of her despair.
<A NAME="705"></A><BR>Superior to her sex, the fearless maid,
<A NAME="706"></A><BR>Approach'd the altar, and around survey'd
<A NAME="707"></A><BR>The cruel rites, and consecrated knife,
<A NAME="708"></A><BR>Which Pyrrhus pointed at her guiltless life,
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>Then as with stern amaze intent he stood,
<A NAME="710"></A><BR>"Now strike," she said; "now spill my genr'ous blood;
<A NAME="711"></A><BR>Deep in my breast, or throat, your dagger sheath,
<A NAME="712"></A><BR>Whilst thus I stand prepar'd to meet my death.
<A NAME="713"></A><BR>For life on terms of slav'ry I despise:
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>Yet sure no God approves this sacrifice.
<A NAME="715"></A><BR>O cou'd I but conceal this dire event
<A NAME="716"></A><BR>From my sad mother, I should dye content.
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>Yet should she not with tears my death deplore,
<A NAME="718"></A><BR>Since her own wretched life demands them more.
<A NAME="719"></A><BR>But let not the rude touch of man pollute
<A NAME="720"></A><BR>A virgin-victim; 'tis a modest suit.
<A NAME="721"></A><BR>It best will please, whoe'er demands my blood,
<A NAME="722"></A><BR>That I untainted reach the Stygian flood.
<A NAME="723"></A><BR>Yet let one short, last, dying prayer be heard;
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>To Priam's daughter pay this last regard;
<A NAME="725"></A><BR>'Tis Priam's daughter, not a captive, sues;
<A NAME="726"></A><BR>Do not the rites of sepulture refuse.
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>To my afflicted mother, I implore,
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>Free without ransom my dead corpse restore:
<A NAME="729"></A><BR>Nor barter me for gain, when I am cold;
<A NAME="730"></A><BR>But be her tears the price, if I am sold:
<A NAME="731"></A><BR>Time was she could have ransom'd me with gold".
<A NAME="732"></A><BR><BR>Thus as she pray'd, one common shower of tears
<A NAME="733"></A><BR>Burst forth, and stream'd from ev'ry eye but hers.
<A NAME="734"></A><BR>Ev'n the priest wept, and with a rude remorse
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>Plung'd in her heart the steel's resistless force.
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>Her slacken'd limbs sunk gently to the ground,
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>Dauntless her looks, unalter'd by the wound.
<A NAME="738"></A><BR>And as she fell, she strove with decent pride
<A NAME="739"></A><BR>To hide, what suits a virgin's care to hide.
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>The Trojan matrons the pale corpse receive,
<A NAME="741"></A><BR>And the whole slaughter'd race of Priam grieve,
<A NAME="742"></A><BR>Sad they recount the long disastrous tale;
<A NAME="743"></A><BR>Then with fresh tears, thee, royal maid, bewail;
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>Thy widow'd mother too, who flourish'd late
<A NAME="745"></A><BR>The royal pride of Asia's happier state:
<A NAME="746"></A><BR>A captive lot now to Ulysses born;
<A NAME="747"></A><BR>Whom yet the victor would reject with scorn,
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>Were she not Hector's mother: Hector's fame
<A NAME="749"></A><BR>Scarce can a master for his mother claim!
<A NAME="750"></A><BR>With strict embrace the lifeless coarse she view'd;
<A NAME="751"></A><BR>And her fresh grief that flood of tears renew'd,
<A NAME="752"></A><BR>With which she lately mourn'd so many dead;
<A NAME="753"></A><BR>Tears for her country, sons, and husband shed.
<A NAME="754"></A><BR>With the thick gushing stream she bath'd the wound;
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>Kiss'd her pale lips; then weltring on the ground,
<A NAME="756"></A><BR>With wonted rage her frantick bosom tore;
<A NAME="757"></A><BR>Sweeping her hair amidst the clotted gore;
<A NAME="758"></A><BR>Whilst her sad accents thus her loss deplore.
<A NAME="759"></A><BR><BR>"Behold a mother's last dear pledge of woe!
<A NAME="760"></A><BR>Yes, 'tis the last I have to suffer now.
<A NAME="761"></A><BR>Thou, my Polyxena, my ills must crown:
<A NAME="762"></A><BR>Already in thy Fate, I feel my own.
<A NAME="763"></A><BR>'Tis thus, lest haply of my numerous seed
<A NAME="764"></A><BR>One should unslaughter'd fall, even thou must bleed:
<A NAME="765"></A><BR>And yet I hop'd thy sex had been thy guard;
<A NAME="766"></A><BR>But neither has thy tender sex been spar'd.
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>The same Achilles, by whose deadly hate
<A NAME="768"></A><BR>Thy brothers fell, urg'd thy untimely fate!
<A NAME="769"></A><BR>The same Achilles, whose destructive rage
<A NAME="770"></A><BR>Laid waste my realms, has robb'd my childless age.
<A NAME="771"></A><BR>When Paris' shafts with Phoebus' certain aid
<A NAME="772"></A><BR>At length had pierc'd this dreaded chief, I said,
<A NAME="773"></A><BR>Secure of future ills, he can no more:
<A NAME="774"></A><BR>But see, he still pursues me as before.
<A NAME="775"></A><BR>With rage rekindled his dead ashes burn;
<A NAME="776"></A><BR>And his yet murd'ring ghost my wretched house must 
<A NAME="777"></A>mourn.
<A NAME="778"></A><BR>This tyrant's lust of slaughter I have fed
<A NAME="779"></A><BR>With large supplies from my too-fruitful bed.
<A NAME="780"></A><BR>Troy's tow'rs lye waste; and the wide ruin ends
<A NAME="781"></A><BR>The publick woe; but me fresh woe attends.
<A NAME="782"></A><BR>Troy still survives to me; to none but me;
<A NAME="783"></A><BR>And from its ills I never must be free.
<A NAME="784"></A><BR>I, who so late had power, and wealth, and ease,
<A NAME="785"></A><BR>Bless'd with my husband, and a large encrease,
<A NAME="786"></A><BR>Must now in poverty an exile mourn;
<A NAME="787"></A><BR>Ev'n from the tombs of my dead offspring torn:
<A NAME="788"></A><BR>Giv'n to Penelope, who proud of spoil,
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>Allots me to the loom's ungrateful toil;
<A NAME="790"></A><BR>Points to her dames, and crys with scorning mien:
<A NAME="791"></A><BR>See Hector's mother, and great Priam's queen!
<A NAME="792"></A><BR>And thou, my child, sole hope of all that's lost,
<A NAME="793"></A><BR>Thou now art slain, to sooth this hostile ghost.
<A NAME="794"></A><BR>Yes, my child falls an offering to my foe!
<A NAME="795"></A><BR>Then what am I, who still survive this woe?
<A NAME="796"></A><BR>Say, cruel Gods! for what new scenes of death
<A NAME="797"></A><BR>Must a poor aged wretch prolong this hated breath?
<A NAME="798"></A><BR>Troy fal'n, to whom could Priam happy seem?
<A NAME="799"></A><BR>Yet was he so; and happy must I deem
<A NAME="800"></A><BR>His death; for O! my child, he saw not thine,
<A NAME="801"></A><BR>When he his life did with his Troy resign.
<A NAME="802"></A><BR>Yet sure due obsequies thy tomb might grace;
<A NAME="803"></A><BR>And thou shalt sleep amidst thy kingly race.
<A NAME="804"></A><BR>Alas! my child, such fortune does not wait
<A NAME="805"></A><BR>Our suffering house in this abandon'd state.
<A NAME="806"></A><BR>A foreign grave, and thy poor mother's tears
<A NAME="807"></A><BR>Are all the honours that attend thy herse.
<A NAME="808"></A><BR>All now is lost!- Yet no; one comfort more
<A NAME="809"></A><BR>Of life remains, my much-lov'd Polydore.
<A NAME="810"></A><BR>My youngest hope: here on this coast he lives,
<A NAME="811"></A><BR>Nurs'd by the guardian-king, he still survives.
<A NAME="812"></A><BR>Then let me hasten to the cleansing flood,
<A NAME="813"></A><BR>And wash away these stains of guiltless blood."
<A NAME="814"></A><BR><BR>Streit to the shore her feeble steps repair
<A NAME="815"></A><BR>With limping pace, and torn dishevell'd hair
<A NAME="816"></A><BR>Silver'd with age. "Give me an urn," she cry'd,
<A NAME="817"></A><BR>"To bear back water from this swelling tide":
<A NAME="818"></A><BR>When on the banks her son in ghastly hue
<A NAME="819"></A><BR>Transfix'd with Thracian arrows strikes her view.
<A NAME="820"></A><BR>The matrons shriek'd; her big-swoln grief surpast
<A NAME="821"></A><BR>The pow'r of utterance; she stood aghast;
<A NAME="822"></A><BR>She had nor speech, nor tears to give relief;
<A NAME="823"></A><BR>Excess of woe suppress'd the rising grief.
<A NAME="824"></A><BR>Lifeless as stone, on Earth she fix'd her eyes;
<A NAME="825"></A><BR>And then look'd up to Heav'n with wild surprise.
<A NAME="826"></A><BR>Now she contemplates o'er with sad delight
<A NAME="827"></A><BR>Her son's pale visage; then her aking sight
<A NAME="828"></A><BR>Dwells on his wounds: she varys thus by turns,
<A NAME="829"></A><BR>Wild as the mother-lion, when among
<A NAME="830"></A><BR>The haunts of prey she seeks her ravish'd young:
<A NAME="831"></A><BR>Swift flies the ravisher; she marks his trace,
<A NAME="832"></A><BR>And by the print directs her anxious chase.
<A NAME="833"></A><BR>So Hecuba with mingled grief, and rage
<A NAME="834"></A><BR>Pursues the king, regardless of her age.
<A NAME="835"></A><BR>She greets the murd'rer with dissembled joy
<A NAME="836"></A><BR>Of secret treasure hoarded for her boy.
<A NAME="837"></A><BR>The specious tale th' unwary king betray'd.
<A NAME="838"></A><BR>Fir'd with the hopes of prey: "Give quick," he said
<A NAME="839"></A><BR>With soft enticing speech, "the promis'd store:
<A NAME="840"></A><BR>Whate'er you give, you give to Polydore.
<A NAME="841"></A><BR>Your son, by the immortal Gods I swear,
<A NAME="842"></A><BR>Shall this with all your former bounty share."
<A NAME="843"></A><BR>She stands attentive to his soothing lyes,
<A NAME="844"></A><BR>And darts avenging horrour from her eyes.
<A NAME="845"></A><BR>Then full resentment fires her boyling blood:
<A NAME="846"></A><BR>She springs upon him, 'midst the captive crowd
<A NAME="847"></A><BR>(Her thirst of vengeance want of strength supplies):
<A NAME="848"></A><BR>Fastens her forky fingers in his eyes:
<A NAME="849"></A><BR>Tears out the rooted balls; her rage pursues,
<A NAME="850"></A><BR>And in the hollow orbs her hand imbrews.
<A NAME="851"></A><BR><BR>The Thracians, fir'd, at this inhuman scene,
<A NAME="852"></A><BR>With darts, and stones assail the frantick queen.
<A NAME="853"></A><BR>She snarls, and growls, nor in an human tone;
<A NAME="854"></A><BR>Then bites impatient at the bounding stone;
<A NAME="855"></A><BR>Extends her jaws, as she her voice would raise
<A NAME="856"></A><BR>To keen invectives in her wonted phrase;
<A NAME="857"></A><BR>But barks, and thence the yelping brute betrays.
<A NAME="858"></A><BR>Still a sad monument the place remains,
<A NAME="859"></A><BR>And from this monstrous change its name obtains:
<A NAME="860"></A><BR>Where she, in long remembrance of her ills,
<A NAME="861"></A><BR>With plaintive howlings the wide desart fills.
<A NAME="862"></A><BR><BR>Greeks, Trojans, friends, and foes, and Gods 
<A NAME="863"></A>above
<A NAME="864"></A><BR>Her num'rous wrongs to just compassion move.
<A NAME="865"></A><BR>Ev'n Juno's self forgets her ancient hate,
<A NAME="866"></A><BR>And owns, she had deserv'd a milder fate.
<A NAME="867"></A><BR><BR><B>The Funeral of Memnon</B>
<A NAME="868"></A><BR><BR>Yet bright Aurora, partial as she was
<A NAME="869"></A><BR>To Troy, and those that lov'd the Trojan cause,
<A NAME="870"></A><BR>Nor Troy, nor Hecuba can now bemoan,
<A NAME="871"></A><BR>But weeps a sad misfortune, more her own.
<A NAME="872"></A><BR>Her offspring Memnon, by Achilles slain,
<A NAME="873"></A><BR>She saw extended on the Phrygian plain:
<A NAME="874"></A><BR>She saw, and strait the purple beams, that grace
<A NAME="875"></A><BR>The rosie morning, vanish'd from her face;
<A NAME="876"></A><BR>A deadly pale her wonted bloom invades,
<A NAME="877"></A><BR>And veils the lowring skies with mournful shades.
<A NAME="878"></A><BR>But when his limbs upon the pile were laid,
<A NAME="879"></A><BR>The last kind duty that by friends is paid,
<A NAME="880"></A><BR>His mother to the skies directs her flight,
<A NAME="881"></A><BR>Nor cou'd sustain to view the doleful sight:
<A NAME="882"></A><BR>But frantick, with her loose neglected hair,
<A NAME="883"></A><BR>Hastens to Jove, and falls a suppliant there.
<A NAME="884"></A><BR>O king of Heav'n, o father of the skies,
<A NAME="885"></A><BR>The weeping Goddess passionately cries,
<A NAME="886"></A><BR>Tho' I the meanest of immortals am,
<A NAME="887"></A><BR>And fewest temples celebrate my fame,
<A NAME="888"></A><BR>Yet still a Goddess, I presume to come
<A NAME="889"></A><BR>Within the verge of your etherial dome:
<A NAME="890"></A><BR>Yet still may plead some merit, if my light
<A NAME="891"></A><BR>With purple dawn controuls the Pow'rs of night;
<A NAME="892"></A><BR>If from a female hand that virtue springs,
<A NAME="893"></A><BR>Which to the Gods, and men such pleasure brings.
<A NAME="894"></A><BR>Yet I nor honours seek, nor rites divine,
<A NAME="895"></A><BR>Nor for more altars, or more fanes repine;
<A NAME="896"></A><BR>Oh! that such trifles were the only cause,
<A NAME="897"></A><BR>From whence Aurora's mind its anguish draws!
<A NAME="898"></A><BR>For Memnon lost, my dearest only child,
<A NAME="899"></A><BR>With weightier grief my heavy heart is fill'd;
<A NAME="900"></A><BR>My warrior son! that liv'd but half his time,
<A NAME="901"></A><BR>Nipt in the bud, and blasted in his prime;
<A NAME="902"></A><BR>Who for his uncle early took the field,
<A NAME="903"></A><BR>And by Achilles' fatal spear was kill'd.
<A NAME="904"></A><BR>To whom but Jove shou'd I for succour come?
<A NAME="905"></A><BR>For Jove alone cou'd fix his cruel doom.
<A NAME="906"></A><BR>O sov'reign of the Gods accept my pray'r,
<A NAME="907"></A><BR>Grant my request, and sooth a mother's care;
<A NAME="908"></A><BR>On the deceas'd some solemn boon bestow,
<A NAME="909"></A><BR>To expiate the loss, and ease my woe.
<A NAME="910"></A><BR><BR>Jove, with a nod, comply'd with her desire;
<A NAME="911"></A><BR>Around the body flam'd the fun'ral fire;
<A NAME="912"></A><BR>The pile decreas'd, that lately seem'd so high,
<A NAME="913"></A><BR>And sheets of smoak roll'd upward to the sky:
<A NAME="914"></A><BR>As humid vapours from a marshy bog,
<A NAME="915"></A><BR>Rise by degrees, condensing into fog,
<A NAME="916"></A><BR>That intercept the sun's enliv'ning ray,
<A NAME="917"></A><BR>And with a cloud infect the chearful day.
<A NAME="918"></A><BR>The sooty ashes wafted by the air,
<A NAME="919"></A><BR>Whirl round, and thicken in a body there;
<A NAME="920"></A><BR>Then take a form, which their own heat, and fire
<A NAME="921"></A><BR>With active life, and energy inspire.
<A NAME="922"></A><BR>Its lightness makes it seem to fly, and soon
<A NAME="923"></A><BR>It skims on real wings, that are its own;
<A NAME="924"></A><BR>A real bird, it beats the breezy wind,
<A NAME="925"></A><BR>Mix'd with a thousand sisters of the kind,
<A NAME="926"></A><BR>That, from the same formation newly sprung,
<A NAME="927"></A><BR>Up-born aloft on plumy pinions hung.
<A NAME="928"></A><BR>Thrice round the pile advanc'd the circling throng.
<A NAME="929"></A><BR>Thrice, with their wings, a whizzing consort rung.
<A NAME="930"></A><BR>In the fourth flight their squadron they divide,
<A NAME="931"></A><BR>Rank'd in two diff'rent troops, on either side:
<A NAME="932"></A><BR>Then two, and two, inspir'd with martial rage,
<A NAME="933"></A><BR>From either troop in equal pairs engage.
<A NAME="934"></A><BR>Each combatant with beak, and pounces press'd,
<A NAME="935"></A><BR>In wrathful ire, his adversary's breast;
<A NAME="936"></A><BR>Each falls a victim, to preserve the fame
<A NAME="937"></A><BR>Of that great hero, whence their being came.
<A NAME="938"></A><BR>From him their courage, and their name they take,
<A NAME="939"></A><BR>And, as they liv'd, they dye for Memnon's sake.
<A NAME="940"></A><BR>Punctual to time, with each revolving year,
<A NAME="941"></A><BR>In fresh array the champion birds appear;
<A NAME="942"></A><BR>Again, prepar'd with vengeful minds, they come
<A NAME="943"></A><BR>To bleed, in honour of the souldier's tomb.
<A NAME="944"></A><BR><BR>Therefore in others it appear'd not strange,
<A NAME="945"></A><BR>To grieve for Hecuba's unhappy change:
<A NAME="946"></A><BR>But poor Aurora had enough to do
<A NAME="947"></A><BR>With her own loss, to mind another's woe;
<A NAME="948"></A><BR>Who still in tears, her tender nature shews,
<A NAME="949"></A><BR>Besprinkling all the world with pearly dews.
<A NAME="950"></A><BR><BR><B>The Voyage of Aeneas</B>
<A NAME="951"></A><BR><BR>Troy thus destroy'd, 'twas still deny'd by Fate,
<A NAME="952"></A><BR>The hopes of Troy should perish with the state.
<A NAME="953"></A><BR>His sire, the son of Cytherea bore,
<A NAME="954"></A><BR>And household-Gods from burning Ilium's shore,
<A NAME="955"></A><BR>The pious prince (a double duty paid)
<A NAME="956"></A><BR>Each sacred burthen thro' the flames convey'd.
<A NAME="957"></A><BR>With young Ascanius, and this only prize,
<A NAME="958"></A><BR>Of heaps of wealth, he from Antandros flies;
<A NAME="959"></A><BR>But struck with horror, left the Thracian shore,
<A NAME="960"></A><BR>Stain'd with the blood of murder'd Polydore.
<A NAME="961"></A><BR>The Delian isle receives the banish'd train,
<A NAME="962"></A><BR>Driv'n by kind gales, and favour'd by the main.
<A NAME="963"></A><BR><BR>Here pious Anius, priest, and monarch reign'd,
<A NAME="964"></A><BR>And either charge, with equal care sustain'd,
<A NAME="965"></A><BR>His subjects rul'd, to Phoebus homage pay'd,
<A NAME="966"></A><BR>His God obeying, and by those obey'd.
<A NAME="967"></A><BR><BR>The priest displays his hospitable gate,
<A NAME="968"></A><BR>And shows the riches of his church, and state
<A NAME="969"></A><BR>The sacred shrubs, which eas'd Latona's pain,
<A NAME="970"></A><BR>The palm, and olive, and the votive fane.
<A NAME="971"></A><BR>Here grateful flames with fuming incense fed,
<A NAME="972"></A><BR>And mingled wine, ambrosial odours shed;
<A NAME="973"></A><BR>Of slaughter'd steers the crackling entrails burn'd:
<A NAME="974"></A><BR>And then the strangers to the court return'd.
<A NAME="975"></A><BR><BR>On beds of tap'stry plac'd aloft, they dine
<A NAME="976"></A><BR>With Ceres' gift, and flowing bowls of wine;
<A NAME="977"></A><BR>When thus Anchises spoke, amidst the feast:
<A NAME="978"></A><BR>Say, mitred monarch, Phoebus' chosen priest,
<A NAME="979"></A><BR>Or (e'er from Troy by cruel Fate expell'd)
<A NAME="980"></A><BR>When first mine eyes these sacred walls beheld,
<A NAME="981"></A><BR>A son, and twice two daughters crown'd thy bliss?
<A NAME="982"></A><BR>Or errs my mem'ry, and I judge amiss?
<A NAME="983"></A><BR><BR>The royal prophet shook his hoary head,
<A NAME="984"></A><BR>With snowy fillets bound, and sighing, said:
<A NAME="985"></A><BR>Thy mem'ry errs not, prince; thou saw'st me then,
<A NAME="986"></A><BR>The happy father of so large a train;
<A NAME="987"></A><BR>Behold me now (such turns of chance befall
<A NAME="988"></A><BR>The race of man!), almost bereft of all.
<A NAME="989"></A><BR>For (ah!) what comfort can my son bestow,
<A NAME="990"></A><BR>What help afford, to mitigate my woe!
<A NAME="991"></A><BR>While far from hence, in Andros' isle he reigns,
<A NAME="992"></A><BR>(From him so nam'd) and there my place sustains.
<A NAME="993"></A><BR>Him Delius praescience gave; the twice-born God
<A NAME="994"></A><BR>A boon more wond'rous on the maids bestow'd.
<A NAME="995"></A><BR>Whate'er they touch'd, he gave them to transmute
<A NAME="996"></A><BR>(A gift past credit, and above their suit)
<A NAME="997"></A><BR>To Ceres, Bacchus, and Minerva's fruit.
<A NAME="998"></A><BR>How great their value, and how rich their use,
<A NAME="999"></A><BR>Whose only touch such treasures could produce!
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR><BR>The dire destroyer of the Trojan reign,
<A NAME="1001"></A><BR>Fierce Agamemnon, such a prize to gain
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR>(A proof we also were design'd by Fate
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR>To feel the tempest, that o'erturn'd your state),
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR>With force superior, and a ruffian crew,
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR>From these weak arms, the helpless virgins drew:
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR>And sternly bad them use the grant divine,
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR>To keep the fleet in corn, and oil, and wine.
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR>Each, as they could, escap'd: two strove to gain
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR>Euboea's isle, and two their brother's reign.
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR>The soldier follows, and demands the dames;
<A NAME="1011"></A><BR>If held by force, immediate war proclaims.
<A NAME="1012"></A><BR>Fear conquer'd Nature in their brother's mind,
<A NAME="1013"></A><BR>And gave them up to punishment assign'd.
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR>Forgive the deed; nor Hector's arm was there,
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR>Nor thine, Aeneas, to maintain the war;
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR>Whose only force upheld your Ilium's tow'rs,
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR>For ten long years, against the Grecian pow'rs.
<A NAME="1018"></A><BR>Prepar'd to bind their captive arms in bands,
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR>To Heav'n they rear'd their yet unfetter'd hands,
<A NAME="1020"></A><BR>Help, Bacchus, author of the gift, they pray'd;
<A NAME="1021"></A><BR>The gift's great author gave immediate aid;
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR>If such destruction of their human frame
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR>By ways so wond'rous, may deserve the name;
<A NAME="1024"></A><BR>Nor could I hear, nor can I now relate
<A NAME="1025"></A><BR>Exact, the manner of their alter'd state;
<A NAME="1026"></A><BR>But this in gen'ral of my loss I knew,
<A NAME="1027"></A><BR>Transform'd to doves, on milky plumes they flew,
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR>Such as on Ida's mount thy consort's chariot drew.
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR><BR>With such discourse, they entertain'd the feast;
<A NAME="1030"></A><BR>Then rose from table, and withdrew to rest.
<A NAME="1031"></A><BR>The following morn, ere Sol was seen to shine,
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR>Th' inquiring Trojans sought the sacred shrine;
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR>The mystick Pow'r commands them to explore
<A NAME="1034"></A><BR>Their ancient mother, and a kindred shore.
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR>Attending to the sea, the gen'rous prince
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR>Dismiss'd his guests with rich munificence,
<A NAME="1037"></A><BR>In old Anchises' hand a sceptre plac'd,
<A NAME="1038"></A><BR>A vest, and quiver young Ascanius grac'd,
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR>His sire, a cup; which from th' Aonian coast,
<A NAME="1040"></A><BR>Ismenian Therses sent his royal host.
<A NAME="1041"></A><BR>Alcon of Myle made what Therses sent,
<A NAME="1042"></A><BR>And carv'd thereon this ample argument.
<A NAME="1043"></A><BR><BR>A town with sev'n distinguish'd gates was shown,
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR>Which spoke its name, and made the city known;
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR>Before it, piles, and tombs, and rising flames,
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR>The rites of death, and quires of mourning dames,
<A NAME="1047"></A><BR>Who bar'd their breasts, and gave their hair to 
<A NAME="1048"></A>flow,
<A NAME="1049"></A><BR>The signs of grief, and marks of publick woe.
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR>Their fountains dry'd, the weeping Naiads mourn'd,
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR>The trees stood bare, with searing cankers burn'd,
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR>No herbage cloath'd the ground, a ragged flock
<A NAME="1053"></A><BR>Of goats half-famish'd, lick'd the naked rock,
<A NAME="1054"></A><BR>Of manly courage, and with mind serene,
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR>Orion's daughters in the town were seen;
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR>One heav'd her chest to meet the lifted knife,
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR>One plung'd the poyniard thro' the seat of life,
<A NAME="1058"></A><BR>Their country's victims; mourns the rescu'd state,
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR>The bodies burns, and celebrates their Fate.
<A NAME="1060"></A><BR>To save the failure of th' illustrious line,
<A NAME="1061"></A><BR>From the pale ashes rose, of form divine,
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR>Two gen'rous youths; these, fame Coronae calls,
<A NAME="1063"></A><BR>Who join the pomp, and mourn their mother's falls.
<A NAME="1064"></A><BR><BR>These burnish'd figures form'd of antique mold,
<A NAME="1065"></A><BR>Shone on the brass, with rising sculpture bold;
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR>A wreath of gilt Acanthus round the brim was roll'd.
<A NAME="1067"></A><BR><BR>Nor less expence the Trojan gifts express'd;
<A NAME="1068"></A><BR>A fuming censer for the royal priest,
<A NAME="1069"></A><BR>A chalice, and a crown of princely cost,
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR>With ruddy gold, and sparkling gems emboss'd.
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR><BR>Now hoisting sail, to Crete the Trojans stood,
<A NAME="1072"></A><BR>Themselves remembring sprung from Teucer's blood;
<A NAME="1073"></A><BR>But Heav'n forbids, and pestilential Jove
<A NAME="1074"></A><BR>From noxious skies, the wand'ring navy drove.
<A NAME="1075"></A><BR>Her hundred cities left, from Crete they bore,
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR>And sought the destin'd land, Ausonia's shore;
<A NAME="1077"></A><BR>But toss'd by storms at either Strophas lay,
<A NAME="1078"></A><BR>'Till scar'd by Harpies from the faithless bay.
<A NAME="1079"></A><BR>Then passing onward with a prosp'rous wind,
<A NAME="1080"></A><BR>Left sly Ulysses' spacious realms behind;
<A NAME="1081"></A><BR>Ambracia's state, in former ages known.
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR>The strife of Gods, the judge transform'd to stone
<A NAME="1083"></A><BR>They saw; for Actian Phoebus since renown'd,
<A NAME="1084"></A><BR>Who Caesar's arms with naval conquest crown'd;
<A NAME="1085"></A><BR>Next pass'd Dodona, wont of old to boast
<A NAME="1086"></A><BR>Her vocal forest; and Chaonia's coast,
<A NAME="1087"></A><BR>Where king Molossus' sons on wings aspir'd,
<A NAME="1088"></A><BR>And saw secure the harmless fewel fir'd.
<A NAME="1089"></A><BR><BR>Now to Phaeacia's happy isle they came,
<A NAME="1090"></A><BR>For fertile orchards known to early fame;
<A NAME="1091"></A><BR>Epirus past, they next beheld with joy
<A NAME="1092"></A><BR>A second Ilium, and fictitious Troy;
<A NAME="1093"></A><BR>Here Trojan Helenus the sceptre sway'd,
<A NAME="1094"></A><BR>Who show'd their fate and mystick truths display'd.
<A NAME="1095"></A><BR>By him confirm'd Sicilia's isle they reach'd,
<A NAME="1096"></A><BR>Whose sides to sea three promontories stretch'd,
<A NAME="1097"></A><BR>Pachynos to the stormy south is plac'd,
<A NAME="1098"></A><BR>On Lilybaeum blows the gentle west,
<A NAME="1099"></A><BR>Peloro's cliffs the northern bear survey,
<A NAME="1100"></A><BR>Who rolls above, and dreads to touch the sea.
<A NAME="1101"></A><BR>By this they steer, and favour'd by the tide,
<A NAME="1102"></A><BR>Secure by night in Zancle's harbour ride.
<A NAME="1103"></A><BR><BR>Here cruel Scylla guards the rocky shore,
<A NAME="1104"></A><BR>And there the waves of loud Charybdis roar:
<A NAME="1105"></A><BR>This sucks, and vomits ships, and bodies drown'd;
<A NAME="1106"></A><BR>And rav'nous dogs the womb of that surround,
<A NAME="1107"></A><BR>In face a virgin; and (if ought be true
<A NAME="1108"></A><BR>By bards recorded) once a virgin too.
<A NAME="1109"></A><BR><BR>A train of youths in vain desir'd her bed;
<A NAME="1110"></A><BR>By sea-nymphs lov'd, to nymphs of seas she fled;
<A NAME="1111"></A><BR>The maid to these, with female pride, display'd
<A NAME="1112"></A><BR>Their baffled courtship, and their love betray'd.
<A NAME="1113"></A><BR><BR>When Galatea thus bespoke the fair
<A NAME="1114"></A><BR>(But first she sigh'd), while Scylla comb'd her 
<A NAME="1115"></A>hair:
<A NAME="1116"></A><BR>You, lovely maid, a gen'rous race pursues,
<A NAME="1117"></A><BR>Whom safe you may (as now you do) refuse;
<A NAME="1118"></A><BR>To me, tho' pow'rful in a num'rous train
<A NAME="1119"></A><BR>Of sisters, sprung from Gods, who rule the main,
<A NAME="1120"></A><BR>My native seas could scarce a refuge prove,
<A NAME="1121"></A><BR>To shun the fury of the Cyclops' love,
<A NAME="1122"></A><BR><BR>Tears choak'd her utt'rance here; the pity'ng 
<A NAME="1123"></A>maid
<A NAME="1124"></A><BR>With marble fingers wip'd them off, and said:
<A NAME="1125"></A><BR><BR>My dearest Goddess, let thy Scylla know,
<A NAME="1126"></A><BR>(For I am faithful) whence these sorrows flow.
<A NAME="1127"></A><BR><BR>The maid's intreaties o'er the nymph prevail,
<A NAME="1128"></A><BR>Who thus to Scylla tells the mournful tale.
<A NAME="1129"></A><BR><BR><B>The Story of Acis, Polyphemus and Galatea</B>
<A NAME="1130"></A><BR><BR>Acis, the lovely youth, whose loss I mourn,
<A NAME="1131"></A><BR>From Faunus, and the nymph Symethis born,
<A NAME="1132"></A><BR>Was both his parents' pleasure; but, to me
<A NAME="1133"></A><BR>Was all that love could make a lover be.
<A NAME="1134"></A><BR>The Gods our minds in mutual bands did join:
<A NAME="1135"></A><BR>I was his only joy, and he was mine.
<A NAME="1136"></A><BR>Now sixteen summers the sweet youth had seen;
<A NAME="1137"></A><BR>And doubtful down began to shade his chin:
<A NAME="1138"></A><BR>When Polyphemus first disturb'd our joy;
<A NAME="1139"></A><BR>And lov'd me fiercely, as I lov'd the boy.
<A NAME="1140"></A><BR>Ask not which passion in my soul was high'r,
<A NAME="1141"></A><BR>My last aversion, or my first desire:
<A NAME="1142"></A><BR>Nor this the greater was, nor that the less;
<A NAME="1143"></A><BR>Both were alike, for both were in excess.
<A NAME="1144"></A><BR>Thee, Venus, thee both Heav'n, and Earth obey;
<A NAME="1145"></A><BR>Immense thy pow'r, and boundless is thy sway.
<A NAME="1146"></A><BR>The Cyclops, who defy'd th' aetherial throne,
<A NAME="1147"></A><BR>And thought no thunder louder than his own,
<A NAME="1148"></A><BR>The terror of the woods, and wilder far
<A NAME="1149"></A><BR>Than wolves in plains, or bears in forests are,
<A NAME="1150"></A><BR>Th' inhuman host, who made his bloody feasts
<A NAME="1151"></A><BR>On mangl'd members of his butcher'd guests,
<A NAME="1152"></A><BR>Yet felt the force of love, and fierce desire,
<A NAME="1153"></A><BR>And burnt for me, with unrelenting fire.
<A NAME="1154"></A><BR>Forgot his caverns, and his woolly care,
<A NAME="1155"></A><BR>Assum'd the softness of a lover's air;
<A NAME="1156"></A><BR>And comb'd, with teeth of rakes, his rugged hair.
<A NAME="1157"></A><BR>Now with a crooked scythe his beard he sleeks;
<A NAME="1158"></A><BR>And mows the stubborn stubble of his cheeks:
<A NAME="1159"></A><BR>Now in the crystal stream he looks, to try
<A NAME="1160"></A><BR>His simagres, and rowls his glaring eye.
<A NAME="1161"></A><BR>His cruelty, and thirst of blood are lost;
<A NAME="1162"></A><BR>And ships securely sail along the coast.
<A NAME="1163"></A><BR><BR>The prophet Telemus (arriv'd by chance
<A NAME="1164"></A><BR>Where Aetna's summets to the seas advance,
<A NAME="1165"></A><BR>Who mark'd the tracts of every bird that flew,
<A NAME="1166"></A><BR>And sure presages from their flying drew)
<A NAME="1167"></A><BR>Foretold the Cyclops, that Ulysses' hand
<A NAME="1168"></A><BR>In his broad eye shou'd thrust a flaming brand.
<A NAME="1169"></A><BR>The giant, with a scornful grin, reply'd,
<A NAME="1170"></A><BR>Vain augur, thou hast falsely prophesy'd;
<A NAME="1171"></A><BR>Already love his flaming brand has tost;
<A NAME="1172"></A><BR>Looking on two fair eyes, my sight I lost,
<A NAME="1173"></A><BR>Thus, warn'd in vain, with stalking pace he strode,
<A NAME="1174"></A><BR>And stamp'd the margin of the briny flood
<A NAME="1175"></A><BR>With heavy steps; and weary, sought agen
<A NAME="1176"></A><BR>The cool retirement of his gloomy den.
<A NAME="1177"></A><BR><BR>A promontory, sharp'ning by degrees,
<A NAME="1178"></A><BR>Ends in a wedge, and overlooks the seas:
<A NAME="1179"></A><BR>On either side, below, the water flows;
<A NAME="1180"></A><BR>This airy walk the giant lover chose.
<A NAME="1181"></A><BR>Here on the midst he sate; his flocks, unled,
<A NAME="1182"></A><BR>Their shepherd follow'd, and securely fed.
<A NAME="1183"></A><BR>A pine so burly, and of length so vast,
<A NAME="1184"></A><BR>That sailing ships requir'd it for a mast,
<A NAME="1185"></A><BR>He wielded for a staff, his steps to guide:
<A NAME="1186"></A><BR>But laid it by, his whistle while he try'd.
<A NAME="1187"></A><BR>A hundred reeds of a prodigious growth,
<A NAME="1188"></A><BR>Scarce made a pipe, proportion'd to his mouth:
<A NAME="1189"></A><BR>Which when he gave it wind, the rocks around,
<A NAME="1190"></A><BR>And watry plains, the dreadful hiss resound.
<A NAME="1191"></A><BR>I heard the ruffian-shepherd rudely blow,
<A NAME="1192"></A><BR>Where, in a hollow cave, I sat below;
<A NAME="1193"></A><BR>On Acis' bosom I my head reclin'd:
<A NAME="1194"></A><BR>And still preserve the poem in my mind.
<A NAME="1195"></A><BR><BR>Oh lovely Galatea, whiter far
<A NAME="1196"></A><BR>Than falling snows, and rising lillies are;
<A NAME="1197"></A><BR>More flowry than the meads, as chrystal bright:
<A NAME="1198"></A><BR>Erect as alders, and of equal height:
<A NAME="1199"></A><BR>More wanton than a kid, more sleek thy skin,
<A NAME="1200"></A><BR>Than orient shells, that on the shores are seen,
<A NAME="1201"></A><BR>Than apples fairer, when the boughs they lade;
<A NAME="1202"></A><BR>Pleasing, as winter suns, or summer shade:
<A NAME="1203"></A><BR>More grateful to the sight, than goodly plains;
<A NAME="1204"></A><BR>And softer to the touch, than down of swans;
<A NAME="1205"></A><BR>Or curds new turn'd; and sweeter to the taste
<A NAME="1206"></A><BR>Than swelling grapes, that to the vintage haste:
<A NAME="1207"></A><BR>More clear than ice, or running streams, that stray
<A NAME="1208"></A><BR>Through garden plots, but ah! more swift than they.
<A NAME="1209"></A><BR><BR>Yet, Galatea, harder to be broke
<A NAME="1210"></A><BR>Than bullocks, unreclaim'd, to bear the yoke,
<A NAME="1211"></A><BR>And far more stubborn, than the knotted oak:
<A NAME="1212"></A><BR>Like sliding streams, impossible to hold;
<A NAME="1213"></A><BR>Like them, fallacious, like their fountains, cold.
<A NAME="1214"></A><BR>More warping, than the willow, to decline
<A NAME="1215"></A><BR>My warm embrace, more brittle, than the vine;
<A NAME="1216"></A><BR>Immovable, and fixt in thy disdain:
<A NAME="1217"></A><BR>Tough, as these rocks, and of a harder grain.
<A NAME="1218"></A><BR>More violent, than is the rising flood;
<A NAME="1219"></A><BR>And the prais'd peacock is not half so proud.
<A NAME="1220"></A><BR>Fierce, as the fire, and sharp, as thistles are,
<A NAME="1221"></A><BR>And more outragious, than a mother-bear:
<A NAME="1222"></A><BR>Deaf, as the billows to the vows I make;
<A NAME="1223"></A><BR>And more revengeful, than a trodden snake.
<A NAME="1224"></A><BR>In swiftness fleeter, than the flying hind,
<A NAME="1225"></A><BR>Or driven tempests, or the driving wind.
<A NAME="1226"></A><BR>All other faults, with patience I can bear;
<A NAME="1227"></A><BR>But swiftness is the vice I only fear.
<A NAME="1228"></A><BR><BR>Yet if you knew me well, you wou'd not shun
<A NAME="1229"></A><BR>My love, but to my wish'd embraces run:
<A NAME="1230"></A><BR>Wou'd languish in your turn, and court my stay;
<A NAME="1231"></A><BR>And much repent of your unwise delay.
<A NAME="1232"></A><BR><BR>My palace, in the living rock, is made
<A NAME="1233"></A><BR>By Nature's hand; a spacious pleasing shade:
<A NAME="1234"></A><BR>Which neither heat can pierce, nor cold invade.
<A NAME="1235"></A><BR>My garden fill'd with fruits you may behold,
<A NAME="1236"></A><BR>And grapes in clusters, imitating gold;
<A NAME="1237"></A><BR>Some blushing bunches of a purple hue:
<A NAME="1238"></A><BR>And these, and those, are all reserv'd for you.
<A NAME="1239"></A><BR>Red strawberries, in shades, expecting stand,
<A NAME="1240"></A><BR>Proud to be gather'd by so white a hand.
<A NAME="1241"></A><BR>Autumnal cornels latter fruit provide;
<A NAME="1242"></A><BR>And plumbs, to tempt you, turn their glossy side:
<A NAME="1243"></A><BR>Not those of common kinds; but such alone,
<A NAME="1244"></A><BR>As in Phaeacian orchards might have grown:
<A NAME="1245"></A><BR>Nor chestnuts shall be wanting to your food,
<A NAME="1246"></A><BR>Nor garden-fruits, nor wildings of the wood;
<A NAME="1247"></A><BR>The laden boughs for you alone shall bear;
<A NAME="1248"></A><BR>And yours shall be the product of the year.
<A NAME="1249"></A><BR><BR>The flocks you see, are all my own; beside
<A NAME="1250"></A><BR>The rest that woods, and winding vallies hide;
<A NAME="1251"></A><BR>And those that folded in the caves abide.
<A NAME="1252"></A><BR>Ask not the numbers of my growing store;
<A NAME="1253"></A><BR>Who knows how many, knows he has no more.
<A NAME="1254"></A><BR>Nor will I praise my cattle; trust not me,
<A NAME="1255"></A><BR>But judge your self, and pass your own decree:
<A NAME="1256"></A><BR>Behold their swelling dugs; the sweepy weight
<A NAME="1257"></A><BR>Of ewes, that sink beneath the milky freight;
<A NAME="1258"></A><BR>In the warm folds their tender lambkins lye;
<A NAME="1259"></A><BR>Apart from kids, that call with human cry.
<A NAME="1260"></A><BR>New milk in nut-brown bowls is duely serv'd
<A NAME="1261"></A><BR>For daily drink; the rest for cheese reserv'd.
<A NAME="1262"></A><BR>Nor are these household dainties all my store:
<A NAME="1263"></A><BR>The fields, and forests will afford us more;
<A NAME="1264"></A><BR>The deer, the hare, the goat, the savage boar.
<A NAME="1265"></A><BR>All sorts of ven'son; and of birds the best;
<A NAME="1266"></A><BR>A pair of turtles taken from the nest.
<A NAME="1267"></A><BR>I walk'd the mountains, and two cubs I found
<A NAME="1268"></A><BR>(Whose dam had left 'em on the naked ground),
<A NAME="1269"></A><BR>So like, that no distinction could be seen:
<A NAME="1270"></A><BR>So pretty, they were presents for a queen;
<A NAME="1271"></A><BR>And so they shall; I took them both away;
<A NAME="1272"></A><BR>And keep, to be companions of your play.
<A NAME="1273"></A><BR><BR>Oh raise, fair nymph, your beauteous face above
<A NAME="1274"></A><BR>The waves; nor scorn my presents, and my love.
<A NAME="1275"></A><BR>Come, Galatea, come, and view my face;
<A NAME="1276"></A><BR>I late beheld it, in the watry glass;
<A NAME="1277"></A><BR>And found it lovelier, than I fear'd it was.
<A NAME="1278"></A><BR>Survey my towring stature, and my size:
<A NAME="1279"></A><BR>Not Jove, the Jove you dream, that rules the skies,
<A NAME="1280"></A><BR>Bears such a bulk, or is so largely spread:
<A NAME="1281"></A><BR>My locks (the plenteous harvest of my head)
<A NAME="1282"></A><BR>Hang o'er my manly face; and dangling down,
<A NAME="1283"></A><BR>As with a shady grove, my shoulders crown.
<A NAME="1284"></A><BR>Nor think, because my limbs and body bear
<A NAME="1285"></A><BR>A thick-set underwood of bristling hair,
<A NAME="1286"></A><BR>My shape deform'd; what fouler sight can be,
<A NAME="1287"></A><BR>Than the bald branches of a leafless tree?
<A NAME="1288"></A><BR>Foul is the steed without a flowing mane:
<A NAME="1289"></A><BR>And birds, without their feathers, and their train.
<A NAME="1290"></A><BR>Wool decks the sheep; and Man receives a grace
<A NAME="1291"></A><BR>From bushy limbs, and from a bearded face.
<A NAME="1292"></A><BR>My forehead with a single eye is fill'd,
<A NAME="1293"></A><BR>Round, as a ball, and ample, as a shield.
<A NAME="1294"></A><BR>The glorious lamp of Heav'n, the radiant sun,
<A NAME="1295"></A><BR>Is Nature's eye; and she's content with one.
<A NAME="1296"></A><BR>Add, that my father sways your seas, and I,
<A NAME="1297"></A><BR>Like you, am of the watry family.
<A NAME="1298"></A><BR>I make you his, in making you my own;
<A NAME="1299"></A><BR>You I adore; and kneel to you alone:
<A NAME="1300"></A><BR>Jove, with his fabled thunder, I despise,
<A NAME="1301"></A><BR>And only fear the lightning of your eyes.
<A NAME="1302"></A><BR>Frown not, fair nymph; yet I cou'd bear to be
<A NAME="1303"></A><BR>Disdain'd, if others were disdain'd with me.
<A NAME="1304"></A><BR>But to repulse the Cyclops, and prefer
<A NAME="1305"></A><BR>The love of Acis (Heav'ns!) I cannot bear.
<A NAME="1306"></A><BR>But let the stripling please himself; nay more,
<A NAME="1307"></A><BR>Please you, tho' that's the thing I most abhor;
<A NAME="1308"></A><BR>The boy shall find, if e'er we cope in fight,
<A NAME="1309"></A><BR>These giant limbs, endu'd with giant might.
<A NAME="1310"></A><BR>His living bowels from his belly torn,
<A NAME="1311"></A><BR>And scatter'd limbs shall on the flood be born:
<A NAME="1312"></A><BR>Thy flood, ungrateful nymph; and fate shall find,
<A NAME="1313"></A><BR>That way for thee, and Acis to be join'd.
<A NAME="1314"></A><BR>For oh! I burn with love, and thy disdain
<A NAME="1315"></A><BR>Augments at once my passion, and my pain.
<A NAME="1316"></A><BR>Translated Aetna flames within my heart,
<A NAME="1317"></A><BR>And thou, inhuman, wilt not ease my smart.
<A NAME="1318"></A><BR><BR>Lamenting thus in vain, he rose, and strode
<A NAME="1319"></A><BR>With furious paces to the neighb'ring wood:
<A NAME="1320"></A><BR>Restless his feet, distracted was his walk;
<A NAME="1321"></A><BR>Mad were his motions, and confus'd his talk.
<A NAME="1322"></A><BR>Mad, as the vanquish'd bull, when forc'd to yield
<A NAME="1323"></A><BR>His lovely mistress, and forsake the field.
<A NAME="1324"></A><BR><BR>Thus far unseen I saw: when fatal chance,
<A NAME="1325"></A><BR>His looks directing, with a sudden glance,
<A NAME="1326"></A><BR>Acis and I were to his sight betray'd;
<A NAME="1327"></A><BR>Where, nought suspecting, we securely play'd.
<A NAME="1328"></A><BR>From his wide mouth a bellowing cry he cast,
<A NAME="1329"></A><BR>I see, I see; but this shall be your last:
<A NAME="1330"></A><BR>A roar so loud made Aetna to rebound:
<A NAME="1331"></A><BR>And all the Cyclops labour'd in the sound.
<A NAME="1332"></A><BR>Affrighted with his monstrous voice, I fled,
<A NAME="1333"></A><BR>And in the neighbouring ocean plung'd my head.
<A NAME="1334"></A><BR>Poor Acis turn'd his back, and Help, he cry'd,
<A NAME="1335"></A><BR>Help, Galatea, help, my parent Gods,
<A NAME="1336"></A><BR>And take me dying to your deep abodes.
<A NAME="1337"></A><BR>The Cyclops follow'd; but he sent before
<A NAME="1338"></A><BR>A rib, which from the living rock he tore:
<A NAME="1339"></A><BR>Though but an angle reach'd him of the stone,
<A NAME="1340"></A><BR>The mighty fragment was enough alone,
<A NAME="1341"></A><BR>To crush all Acis; 'twas too late to save,
<A NAME="1342"></A><BR>But what the Fates allow'd to give, I gave:
<A NAME="1343"></A><BR>That Acis to his lineage should return;
<A NAME="1344"></A><BR>And rowl, among the river Gods, his urn.
<A NAME="1345"></A><BR>Straight issu'd from the stone a stream of blood;
<A NAME="1346"></A><BR>Which lost the purple, mingling with the flood,
<A NAME="1347"></A><BR>Then, like a troubled torrent, it appear'd:
<A NAME="1348"></A><BR>The torrent too, in little space, was clear'd.
<A NAME="1349"></A><BR>The stone was cleft, and through the yawning chink
<A NAME="1350"></A><BR>New reeds arose, on the new river's brink.
<A NAME="1351"></A><BR>The rock, from out its hollow womb, disclos'd
<A NAME="1352"></A><BR>A sound like water in its course oppos'd,
<A NAME="1353"></A><BR>When (wond'rous to behold), full in the flood,
<A NAME="1354"></A><BR>Up starts a youth, and navel high he stood.
<A NAME="1355"></A><BR>Horns from his temples rise; and either horn
<A NAME="1356"></A><BR>Thick wreaths of reeds (his native growth) adorn.
<A NAME="1357"></A><BR>Were not his stature taller than before,
<A NAME="1358"></A><BR>His bulk augmented, and his beauty more,
<A NAME="1359"></A><BR>His colour blue; for Acis he might pass:
<A NAME="1360"></A><BR>And Acis chang'd into a stream he was,
<A NAME="1361"></A><BR>But mine no more; he rowls along the plains
<A NAME="1362"></A><BR>With rapid motion, and his name retains.
<A NAME="1363"></A><BR><BR><B>The Story of Glaucus and Scylla</B>
<A NAME="1364"></A><BR><BR>Here ceas'd the nymph; the fair assembly broke,
<A NAME="1365"></A><BR>The sea-green Nereids to the waves betook:
<A NAME="1366"></A><BR>While Scylla, fearful of the wide-spread main,
<A NAME="1367"></A><BR>Swift to the safer shore returns again.
<A NAME="1368"></A><BR>There o'er the sandy margin, unarray'd,
<A NAME="1369"></A><BR>With printless footsteps flies the bounding maid;
<A NAME="1370"></A><BR>Or in some winding creek's secure retreat
<A NAME="1371"></A><BR>She baths her weary limbs, and shuns the noonday's 
<A NAME="1372"></A>heat.
<A NAME="1373"></A><BR>Her Glaucus saw, as o'er the deep he rode,
<A NAME="1374"></A><BR>New to the seas, and late receiv'd a God.
<A NAME="1375"></A><BR>He saw, and languish'd for the virgin's love;
<A NAME="1376"></A><BR>With many an artful blandishment he strove
<A NAME="1377"></A><BR>Her flight to hinder, and her fears remove.
<A NAME="1378"></A><BR>The more he sues, the more she wings her flight,
<A NAME="1379"></A><BR>And nimbly gains a neighb'ring mountain's height.
<A NAME="1380"></A><BR>Steep shelving to the margin of the flood,
<A NAME="1381"></A><BR>A neighb'ring mountain bare, and woodless stood;
<A NAME="1382"></A><BR>Here, by the place secur'd, her steps she stay'd,
<A NAME="1383"></A><BR>And, trembling still, her lover's form survey'd.
<A NAME="1384"></A><BR>His shape, his hue, her troubled sense appall,
<A NAME="1385"></A><BR>And dropping locks that o'er his shoulders fall;
<A NAME="1386"></A><BR>She sees his face divine, and manly brow,
<A NAME="1387"></A><BR>End in a fish's wreathy tail below:
<A NAME="1388"></A><BR>She sees, and doubts within her anxious mind,
<A NAME="1389"></A><BR>Whether he comes of God, or monster kind.
<A NAME="1390"></A><BR>This Glaucus soon perceiv'd; and, Oh! forbear
<A NAME="1391"></A><BR>(His hand supporting on a rock lay near),
<A NAME="1392"></A><BR>Forbear, he cry'd, fond maid, this needless fear.
<A NAME="1393"></A><BR>Nor fish am I, nor monster of the main,
<A NAME="1394"></A><BR>But equal with the watry Gods I reign;
<A NAME="1395"></A><BR>Nor Proteus, nor Palaemon me excell,
<A NAME="1396"></A><BR>Nor he whose breath inspires the sounding shell.
<A NAME="1397"></A><BR>My birth, 'tis true, I owe to mortal race,
<A NAME="1398"></A><BR>And I my self but late a mortal was:
<A NAME="1399"></A><BR>Ev'n then in seas, and seas alone, I joy'd;
<A NAME="1400"></A><BR>The seas my hours, and all my cares employ'd,
<A NAME="1401"></A><BR>In meshes now the twinkling prey I drew;
<A NAME="1402"></A><BR>Now skilfully the slender line I threw,
<A NAME="1403"></A><BR>And silent sat the moving float to view.
<A NAME="1404"></A><BR>Not far from shore, there lies a verdant mead,
<A NAME="1405"></A><BR>With herbage half, and half with water spread:
<A NAME="1406"></A><BR>There, nor the horned heifers browsing stray,
<A NAME="1407"></A><BR>Nor shaggy kids, nor wanton lambkins play;
<A NAME="1408"></A><BR>There, nor the sounding bees their nectar cull,
<A NAME="1409"></A><BR>Nor rural swains their genial chaplets pull,
<A NAME="1410"></A><BR>Nor flocks, nor herds, nor mowers haunt the place,
<A NAME="1411"></A><BR>To crop the flow'rs, or cut the bushy grass:
<A NAME="1412"></A><BR>Thither, sure first of living race came I,
<A NAME="1413"></A><BR>And sat by chance, my dropping nets to dry.
<A NAME="1414"></A><BR>My scaly prize, in order all display'd,
<A NAME="1415"></A><BR>By number on the greensward there I lay'd,
<A NAME="1416"></A><BR>My captives, whom or in my nets I took,
<A NAME="1417"></A><BR>Or hung unwary on my wily hook.
<A NAME="1418"></A><BR>Strange to behold! yet what avails a lye?
<A NAME="1419"></A><BR>I saw 'em bite the grass, as I sate by;
<A NAME="1420"></A><BR>Then sudden darting o'er the verdant plain,
<A NAME="1421"></A><BR>They spread their finns, as in their native main:
<A NAME="1422"></A><BR>I paus'd, with wonder struck, while all my prey
<A NAME="1423"></A><BR>Left their new master, and regain'd the sea.
<A NAME="1424"></A><BR>Amaz'd, within my secret self I sought,
<A NAME="1425"></A><BR>What God, what herb the miracle had wrought:
<A NAME="1426"></A><BR>But sure no herbs have pow'r like this, I cry'd;
<A NAME="1427"></A><BR>And strait I pluck'd some neighb'ring herbs, and 
<A NAME="1428"></A>try'd.
<A NAME="1429"></A><BR>Scarce had I bit, and prov'd the wond'rous taste,
<A NAME="1430"></A><BR>When strong convulsions shook my troubled breast;
<A NAME="1431"></A><BR>I felt my heart grow fond of something strange,
<A NAME="1432"></A><BR>And my whole Nature lab'ring with a change.
<A NAME="1433"></A><BR>Restless I grew, and ev'ry place forsook,
<A NAME="1434"></A><BR>And still upon the seas I bent my look.
<A NAME="1435"></A><BR>Farewel for ever! farewel, land! I said;
<A NAME="1436"></A><BR>And plung'd amidst the waves my sinking head.
<A NAME="1437"></A><BR>The gentle Pow'rs, who that low empire keep,
<A NAME="1438"></A><BR>Receiv'd me as a brother of the deep;
<A NAME="1439"></A><BR>To Tethys, and to Ocean old, they pray
<A NAME="1440"></A><BR>To purge my mortal earthy parts away.
<A NAME="1441"></A><BR>The watry parents to their suit agreed,
<A NAME="1442"></A><BR>And thrice nine times a secret charm they read,
<A NAME="1443"></A><BR>Then with lustrations purify my limbs,
<A NAME="1444"></A><BR>And bid me bathe beneath a hundred streams:
<A NAME="1445"></A><BR>A hundred streams from various fountains run,
<A NAME="1446"></A><BR>And on my head at once come rushing down.
<A NAME="1447"></A><BR>Thus far each passage I remember well,
<A NAME="1448"></A><BR>And faithfully thus far the tale I tell;
<A NAME="1449"></A><BR>But then oblivion dark, on all my senses fell.
<A NAME="1450"></A><BR>Again at length my thought reviving came,
<A NAME="1451"></A><BR>When I no longer found my self the same;
<A NAME="1452"></A><BR>Then first this sea-green beard I felt to grow,
<A NAME="1453"></A><BR>And these large honours on my spreading brow;
<A NAME="1454"></A><BR>My long-descending locks the billows sweep,
<A NAME="1455"></A><BR>And my broad shoulders cleave the yielding deep;
<A NAME="1456"></A><BR>My fishy tail, my arms of azure hue,
<A NAME="1457"></A><BR>And ev'ry part divinely chang'd, I view.
<A NAME="1458"></A><BR>But what avail these useless honours now?
<A NAME="1459"></A><BR>What joys can immortality bestow?
<A NAME="1460"></A><BR>What, tho' our Nereids all my form approve?
<A NAME="1461"></A><BR>What boots it, while fair Scylla scorns my love?
<A NAME="1462"></A><BR><BR>Thus far the God; and more he wou'd have said;
<A NAME="1463"></A><BR>When from his presence flew the ruthless maid.
<A NAME="1464"></A><BR>Stung with repulse, in such disdainful sort,
<A NAME="1465"></A><BR>He seeks Titanian Circe's horrid court.
