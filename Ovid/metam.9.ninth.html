<A NAME="10"></A><B>The Story of Achelous and Hercules</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>Theseus requests the God to tell his woes,
<A NAME="12"></A><BR>Whence his maim'd brow, and whence his groans arose
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>Whence thus the Calydonian stream reply'd,
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>With twining reeds his careless tresses ty'd:
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>Ungrateful is the tale; for who can bear,
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>When conquer'd, to rehearse the shameful war?
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>Yet I'll the melancholy story trace;
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>So great a conqu'ror softens the disgrace:
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>Nor was it still so mean the prize to yield,
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>As great, and glorious to dispute the field.
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>Perhaps you've heard of Deianira's name,
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>For all the country spoke her beauty's fame.
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>Long was the nymph by num'rous suitors woo'd,
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>Each with address his envy'd hopes pursu'd:
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>I joyn'd the loving band; to gain the fair,
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>Reveal'd my passion to her father's ear.
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>Their vain pretensions all the rest resign,
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>Alcides only strove to equal mine;
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>He boasts his birth from Jove, recounts his spoils,
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>His step-dame's hate subdu'd, and finish'd toils.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR>Can mortals then (said I), with Gods compare?
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>Behold a God; mine is the watry care:
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>Through your wide realms I take my mazy way,
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>Branch into streams, and o'er the region stray:
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>No foreign guest your daughter's charms adores,
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>But one who rises in your native shores.
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>Let not his punishment your pity move;
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>Is Juno's hate an argument for love?
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>Though you your life from fair Alcmena drew,
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>Jove's a feign'd father, or by fraud a true.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>Chuse then; confess thy mother's honour lost,
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>Or thy descent from Jove no longer boast.
<A NAME="43"></A><BR><BR>While thus I spoke, he look'd with stern disdain,
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>Nor could the sallies of his wrath restrain,
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>Which thus break forth. This arm decides our right;
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>Vanquish in words, be mine the prize in fight.
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR>Bold he rush'd on. My honour to maintain,
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>I fling my verdant garments on the plain,
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>My arms stretch forth, my pliant limbs prepare,
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>And with bent hands expect the furious war.
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>O'er my sleek skin now gather'd dust he throws,
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>And yellow sand his mighty muscles strows.
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>Oft he my neck, and nimble legs assails,
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>He seems to grasp me, but as often fails.
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>Each part he now invades with eager hand;
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>Safe in my bulk, immoveable I stand.
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>So when loud storms break high, and foam and roar
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>Against some mole that stretches from the shore;
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>The firm foundation lasting tempests braves,
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>Defies the warring winds, and driving waves.
<A NAME="61"></A><BR><BR>A-while we breathe, then forward rush amain,
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>Renew the combat, and our ground maintain;
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>Foot strove with foot, I prone extend my breast,
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>Hands war with hands, and forehead forehead prest.
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>Thus have I seen two furious bulls engage,
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>Inflam'd with equal love, and equal rage;
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>Each claims the fairest heifer of the grove,
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>And conquest only can decide their love:
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>The trembling herds survey the fight from far,
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>'Till victory decides th' important war.
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>Three times in vain he strove my joints to wrest,
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>To force my hold, and throw me from his breast;
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>The fourth he broke my gripe, that clasp'd him round,
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>Then with new force he stretch'd me on the ground;
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>Close to my back the mighty burthen clung,
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>As if a mountain o'er my limbs were flung.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>Believe my tale; nor do I, boastful, aim
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>By feign'd narration to extol my fame.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>No sooner from his grasp I freedom get,
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>Unlock my arms, that flow'd with trickling sweat,
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>But quick he seized me, and renew'd the strife,
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>As my exhausted bosom pants for life:
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>My neck he gripes, my knee to earth he strains;
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>I fall, and bite the sand with shame, and pains.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>O'er-match'd in strength, to wiles, and arts I 
<A NAME="86"></A>take,
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>And slip his hold, in form of speckled snake;
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>Who, when I wreath'd in spires my body round,
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>Or show'd my forky tongue with hissing sound,
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>Smiles at my threats: Such foes my cradle knew,
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>He cries, dire snakes my infant hand o'erthrew;
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>A dragon's form might other conquests gain,
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>To war with me you take that shape in vain.
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>Art thou proportion'd to the Hydra's length,
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>Who by his wounds receiv'd augmented strength?
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>He rais'd a hundred hissing heads in air;
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>When one I lopt, up-sprung a dreadful pair.
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>By his wounds fertile, and with slaughter strong,
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>Singly I quell'd him, and stretch'd dead along.
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>What canst thou do, a form precarious, prone,
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>To rouse my rage with terrors not thy own?
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>He said; and round my neck his hands he cast,
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>And with his straining fingers wrung me fast;
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>My throat he tortur'd, close as pincers clasp,
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>In vain I strove to loose the forceful grasp.
<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR>Thus vanquish'd too, a third form still remains,
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>Chang'd to a bull, my lowing fills the plains.
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>Strait on the left his nervous arms were thrown
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>Upon my brindled neck, and tugg'd it down;
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>Then deep he struck my horn into the sand,
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>And fell'd my bulk among the dusty land.
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>Nor yet his fury cool'd; 'twixt rage and scorn,
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>From my maim'd front he tore the stubborn horn:
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>This, heap'd with flow'rs, and fruits, the Naiads 
<A NAME="115"></A>bear,
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>Sacred to plenty, and the bounteous year.
<A NAME="117"></A><BR><BR>He spoke; when lo, a beauteous nymph appears,
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>Girt like Diana's train, with flowing hairs;
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>The horn she brings in which all Autumn's stor'd,
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>And ruddy apples for the second board.
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR>Now morn begins to dawn, the sun's bright fire
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>Gilds the high mountains, and the youths retire;
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>Nor stay'd they, 'till the troubled stream subsides,
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>And in its bounds with peaceful current glides.
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>But Achelous in his oozy bed
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>Deep hides his brow deform'd, and rustick head:
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>No real wound the victor's triumph show'd,
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>But his lost honours griev'd the watry God;
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>Yet ev'n that loss the willow's leaves o'erspread,
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>And verdant reeds, in garlands, bind his head.
<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR><B>The Death of Nessus the Centaur</B>
<A NAME="132"></A><BR><BR>This virgin too, thy love, O Nessus, found,
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>To her alone you owe the fatal wound.
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>As the strong son of Jove his bride conveys,
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>Where his paternal lands their bulwarks raise;
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>Where from her slopy urn, Evenus pours
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>Her rapid current, swell'd by wintry show'rs,
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>He came. The frequent eddies whirl'd the tide,
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>And the deep rolling waves all pass deny'd.
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>As for himself, he stood unmov'd by fears,
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>For now his bridal charge employ'd his cares,
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>The strong-limb'd Nessus thus officious cry'd
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>(For he the shallows of the stream had try'd),
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>Swim thou, Alcides, all thy strength prepare,
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>On yonder bank I'll lodge thy nuptial care.
<A NAME="146"></A><BR><BR>Th' Aonian chief to Nessus trusts his wife,
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>All pale, and trembling for her heroe's life:
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>Cloath'd as he stood in the fierce lion's hide,
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>The laden quiver o'er his shoulder ty'd
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>(For cross the stream his bow and club were cast),
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>Swift he plung'd in: These billows shall be past,
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>He said, nor sought where smoother waters glide,
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>But stem'd the rapid dangers of the tide.
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>The bank he reach'd; again the bow he bears;
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>When, hark! his bride's known voice alarms his ears.
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>Nessus, to thee I call (aloud he cries)
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>Vain is thy trust in flight, be timely wise:
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>Thou monster double-shap'd, my right set free;
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>If thou no rev'rence owe my fame and me,
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>Yet kindred should thy lawless lust deny;
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>Think not, perfidious wretch, from me to fly,
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>Tho' wing'd with horse's speed; wounds shall pursue;
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>Swift as his words the fatal arrow flew:
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>The centaur's back admits the feather'd wood,
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>And thro' his breast the barbed weapon stood;
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>Which when, in anguish, thro' the flesh he tore,
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>From both the wounds gush'd forth the spumy gore
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>Mix'd with Lernaean venom; this he took,
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>Nor dire revenge his dying breast forsook.
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>His garment, in the reeking purple dy'd,
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>To rouse love's passion, he presents the bride.
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR><B>The Death of Hercules</B>
<A NAME="173"></A><BR><BR>Now a long interval of time succeeds,
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>When the great son of Jove's immortal deeds,
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>And step-dame's hate, had fill'd Earth's utmost 
<A NAME="176"></A>round;
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>He from Oechalia, with new lawrels crown'd,
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>In triumph was return'd. He rites prepares,
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>And to the King of Gods directs his pray'rs;
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>When Fame (who falshood cloaths in truth's disguise,
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>And swells her little bulk with growing lies)
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>Thy tender ear, o Deianira, mov'd,
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>That Hercules the fair Iole lov'd.
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>Her love believes the tale; the truth she fears
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>Of his new passion, and gives way to tears.
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>The flowing tears diffus'd her wretched grief,
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>Why seek I thus, from streaming eyes, relief?
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>She cries; indulge not thus these fruitless cares,
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>The harlot will but triumph in thy tears:
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>Let something be resolv'd, while yet there's time;
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>My bed not conscious of a rival's crime.
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>In silence shall I mourn, or loud complain?
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>Shall I seek Calydon, or here remain?
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>What tho', ally'd to Meleager's fame,
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>I boast the honours of a sister's name?
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>My wrongs, perhaps, now urge me to pursue
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>Some desp'rate deed, by which the world shall view
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>How far revenge, and woman's rage can rise,
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>When weltring in her blood the harlot dies.
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR>Thus various passions rul'd by turns her breast,
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>She now resolves to send the fatal vest,
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>Dy'd with Lernaean gore, whose pow'r might move
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>His soul anew, and rouse declining love.
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>Nor knew she what her sudden rage bestows,
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>When she to Lychas trusts her future woes;
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>With soft endearments she the boy commands,
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>To bear the garment to her husband's hands.
<A NAME="208"></A><BR><BR>Th' unwitting hero takes the gift in haste,
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>And o'er his shoulders Lerna's poison cast,
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>As first the fire with frankincense he strows,
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>And utters to the Gods his holy vows;
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>And on the marble altar's polish'd frame
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>Pours forth the grapy stream; the rising flame
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>Sudden dissolves the subtle pois'nous juice,
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>Which taints his blood, and all his nerves bedews.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>With wonted fortitude he bore the smart,
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>And not a groan confess'd his burning heart.
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>At length his patience was subdu'd by pain,
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>He rends the sacred altar from the plain;
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>Oete's wide forests echo with his cries:
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>Now to rip off the deathful robe he tries.
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>Where-e'er he plucks the vest, the skin he tears,
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>The mangled muscles, and huge bones he bares
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>(A ghastful sight!), or raging with his pain,
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>To rend the sticking plague he tugs in vain.
<A NAME="226"></A><BR><BR>As the red iron hisses in the flood,
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>So boils the venom in his curdling blood.
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>Now with the greedy flame his entrails glow,
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>And livid sweats down all his body flow;
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>The cracking nerves burnt up are burst in twain,
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>The lurking venom melts his swimming brain.
<A NAME="232"></A><BR><BR>Then, lifting both his hands aloft, he cries,
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>Glut thy revenge, dread Empress of the skies;
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>Sate with my death the rancour of thy heart,
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>Look down with pleasure, and enjoy my smart.
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>Or, if e'er pity mov'd a hostile breast
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>(For here I stand thy enemy profest),
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>Take hence this hateful life, with tortures torn,
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>Inur'd to trouble, and to labours born.
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>Death is the gift most welcome to my woe,
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>And such a gift a stepdame may bestow.
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>Was it for this Busiris was subdu'd,
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>Whose barb'rous temples reek'd with strangers' blood?
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>Press'd in these arms his fate Antaeus found,
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>Nor gain'd recruited vigour from the ground.
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>Did I not triple-form'd Geryon fell?
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>Or did I fear the triple dog of Hell?
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>Did not these hands the bull's arm'd forehead hold?
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>Are not our mighty toils in Elis told?
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>Do not Stymphalian lakes proclaim thy fame?
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>And fair Parthenian woods resound thy name?
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>Who seiz'd the golden belt of Thermodon?
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>And who the dragon-guarded apples won?
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>Could the fierce centaur's strength my force withstand,
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>Or the fell boar that spoil'd th' Arcadian land?
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>Did not these arms the Hydra's rage subdue,
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>Who from his wounds to double fury grew?
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>What if the Thracian horses, fat with gore,
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>Who human bodies in their mangers tore,
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>I saw, and with their barb'rous lord o'erthrew?
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>What if these hands Nemaea's lion slew?
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>Did not this neck the heav'nly globe sustain?
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>The female partner of the Thunderer's reign
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>Fatigu'd, at length suspends her harsh commands,
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>Yet no fatigue hath slack'd these valiant hands.
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>But now new plagues pursue me, neither force,
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>Nor arms, nor darts can stop their raging course.
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>Devouring flame thro' my rack'd entrails strays,
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>And on my lungs and shrivel'd muscles preys.
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>Yet still Eurystheus breathes the vital air.
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>What mortal now shall seek the Gods with pray'r?
<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR><B>The Transformation of Lychas into a Rock</B>
<A NAME="273"></A><BR><BR>The hero said; and with the torture stung,
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>Furious o'er Oete's lofty hills he sprung.
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>Stuck with the shaft, thus scours the tyger round,
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>And seeks the flying author of his wound.
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>Now might you see him trembling, now he vents
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>His anguish'd soul in groans, and loud laments;
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>He strives to tear the clinging vest in vain,
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>And with up-rooted forests strows the plain;
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>Now kindling into rage, his hands he rears,
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>And to his kindred Gods directs his pray'rs.
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>When Lychas, lo, he spies; who trembling flew,
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>And in a hollow rock conceal'd from view,
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>Had shun'd his wrath. Now grief renew'd his pain,
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>His madness chaf'd, and thus he raves again.
<A NAME="287"></A><BR><BR>Lychas, to thee alone my fate I owe,
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>Who bore the gift, the cause of all my woe.
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>The youth all pale, with shiv'ring fear was stung,
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>And vain excuses falter'd on his tongue.
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>Alcides snatch'd him, as with suppliant face
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>He strove to clasp his knees, and beg for grace:
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>He toss'd him o'er his head with airy course,
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>And hurl'd with more than with an engine's force;
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>Far o'er th' Eubaean main aloof he flies,
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>And hardens by degrees amid the skies.
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>So showry drops, when chilly tempests blow,
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>Thicken at first, then whiten into snow,
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>In balls congeal'd the rolling fleeces bound,
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>In solid hail result upon the ground.
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>Thus, whirl'd with nervous force thro' distant air,
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>The purple tide forsook his veins, with fear;
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>All moisture left his limbs. Transform'd to stone,
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>In ancient days the craggy flint was known;
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>Still in the Eubaean waves his front he rears,
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>Still the small rock in human form appears,
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>And still the name of hapless Lychas bears.
<A NAME="308"></A><BR><BR><B>The Apotheosis of Hercules</B>
<A NAME="309"></A><BR><BR>But now the hero of immortal birth
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>Fells Oete's forests on the groaning Earth;
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>A pile he builds; to Philoctetes' care
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>He leaves his deathful instruments of war;
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>To him commits those arrows, which again
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>Shall see the bulwarks of the Trojan reign.
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>The son of Paean lights the lofty pyre,
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>High round the structure climbs the greedy fire;
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>Plac'd on the top, thy nervous shoulders spread
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>With the Nemaean spoils, thy careless head
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>Rais'd on a knotty club, with look divine,
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>Here thou, dread hero, of celestial line,
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>Wert stretch'd at ease; as when a chearful guest,
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>Wine crown'd thy bowls, and flow'rs thy temples 
<A NAME="323"></A>drest.
<A NAME="324"></A><BR><BR>Now on all sides the potent flames aspire,
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>And crackle round those limbs that mock the fire
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>A sudden terror seiz'd th' immortal host,
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>Who thought the world's profess'd defender lost.
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>This when the Thund'rer saw, with smiles he cries,
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>'Tis from your fears, ye Gods, my pleasures rise;
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>Joy swells my breast, that my all-ruling hand
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>O'er such a grateful people boasts command,
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>That you my suff'ring progeny would aid;
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>Tho' to his deeds this just respect be paid,
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>Me you've oblig'd. Be all your fears forborn,
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>Th' Oetean fires do thou, great hero, scorn.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>Who vanquish'd all things, shall subdue the flame.
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>That part alone of gross maternal frame
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>Fire shall devour; while what from me he drew
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>Shall live immortal, and its force subdue;
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>That, when he's dead, I'll raise to realms above;
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>May all the Pow'rs the righteous act approve.
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>If any God dissent, and judge too great
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>The sacred honours of the heav'nly seat,
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>Ev'n he shall own his deeds deserve the sky,
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>Ev'n he reluctant, shall at length comply.
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>Th' assembled Pow'rs assent. No frown 'till now
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>Had mark'd with passion vengeful Juno's brow,
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>Mean-while whate'er was in the pow'r of flame
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>Was all consum'd; his body's nervous frame
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>No more was known, of human form bereft,
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>Th' eternal part of Jove alone was left.
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>As an old serpent casts his scaly vest,
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>Wreathes in the sun, in youthful glory drest;
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>So when Alcides mortal mold resign'd,
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>His better part enlarg'd, and grew refin'd;
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>August his visage shone; almighty Jove
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>In his swift carr his honour'd offspring drove;
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>High o'er the hollow clouds the coursers fly,
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>And lodge the hero in the starry sky.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR><B>The Transformation of Galanthis</B>
<A NAME="361"></A><BR><BR>Atlas perceiv'd the load of Heav'n's new guest.
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>Revenge still rancour'd in Eurystheus' breast
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>Against Alcides' race. Alcmena goes
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>To Iole, to vent maternal woes;
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>Here she pours forth her grief, recounts the spoils
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>Her son had bravely reap'd in glorious toils.
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>This Iole, by Hercules' commands,
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>Hyllus had lov'd, and joyn'd in nuptial bands.
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>Her swelling womb the teeming birth confess'd,
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>To whom Alcmena thus her speech address'd.
<A NAME="371"></A><BR><BR>O, may the Gods protect thee, in that hour,
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>When, 'midst thy throws, thou call'st th' Ilithyan 
<A NAME="373"></A>Pow'r!
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>May no delays prolong thy racking pain,
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>As when I su'd for Juno's aid in vain.
<A NAME="376"></A><BR><BR>When now Alcides' mighty birth drew nigh,
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>And the tenth sign roll'd forward on the sky,
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>My womb extends with such a mighty load,
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>As Jove the parent of the burthen show'd.
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>I could no more th' encreasing smart sustain,
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>My horror kindles to recount the pain;
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>Cold chills my limbs while I the tale pursue,
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>And now methinks I feel my pangs anew.
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>Seven days and nights amidst incessant throws,
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>Fatigu'd with ills I lay, nor knew repose;
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>When lifting high my hands, in shrieks I pray'd,
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>Implor'd the Gods, and call'd Lucina's aid.
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>She came, but prejudic'd, to give my Fate
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>A sacrifice to vengeful Juno's hate.
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>She hears the groaning anguish of my fits,
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>And on the altar at my door she sits.
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>O'er her left knee her crossing leg she cast,
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>Then knits her fingers close, and wrings them fast:
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>This stay'd the birth; in mutt'ring verse she pray'd,
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>The mutt'ring verse th' unfinish'd birth delay'd.
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>Now with fierce struggles, raging with my pain,
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>At Jove's ingratitude I rave in vain.
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>How did I wish for death! such groans I sent,
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>As might have made the flinty heart relent.
<A NAME="400"></A><BR><BR>Now the Cadmeian matrons round me press,
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>Offer their vows, and seek to bring redress;
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>Among the Theban dames Galanthis stands,
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>Strong limb'd, red hair'd, and just to my commands:
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>She first perceiv'd that all these racking woes
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>From the persisting hate of Juno rose.
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>As here and there she pass'd, by chance she sees
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>The seated Goddess; on her close-press'd knees
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>Her fast-knit hands she leans; with chearful voice
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>Galanthis cries, Whoe'er thou art, rejoyce,
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>Congratulate the dame, she lies at rest,
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>At length the Gods Alcmena's womb have blest.
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>Swift from her seat the startled Goddess springs,
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>No more conceal'd, her hands abroad she flings;
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>The charm unloos'd, the birth my pangs reliev'd;
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>Galanthis' laughter vex'd the Pow'r deceiv'd.
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>Fame says, the Goddess dragg'd the laughing maid
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>Fast by the hair; in vain her force essay'd
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>Her grov'ling body from the ground to rear;
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>Chang'd to fore-feet her shrinking arms appear:
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>Her hairy back her former hue retains,
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>The form alone is lost; her strength remains;
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>Who, since the lye did from her mouth proceed,
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>Shall from her pregnant mouth bring forth her breed;
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>Nor shall she quit her long-frequented home,
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>But haunt those houses where she lov'd to roam.
<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR><B>The Fable of Dryope</B>
<A NAME="427"></A><BR><BR>She said, and for her lost Galanthis sighs;
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>When the fair consort of her son replies;
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>Since you a servant's ravish'd form bemoan,
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>And kindly sigh for sorrows not your own,
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>Let me (if tears and grief permit) relate
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>A nearer woe, a sister's stranger fate.
<A NAME="433"></A><BR><BR>No nymph of all Oechaloa could compare
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>For beauteous form with Dryope the fair;
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>Her tender mother's only hope and pride
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>(My self the offspring of a second bride),
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>This nymph, compress'd by him who rules the day,
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>Whom Delphi, and the Delian isle obey,
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>Andraemon lov'd; and blest in all those charms
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>That pleas'd a God, succeeded to her arms.
<A NAME="441"></A><BR><BR>A lake there was, with shelving banks around,
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>Whose verdant summit fragrant myrtles crown'd.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>Those shades, unknowing of the fates, she sought;
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>And to the Naiads flow'ry garlands brought;
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>Her smiling babe (a pleasing charge) she prest
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>Between her arms, and nourish'd at her breast.
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>Not distant far a watry lotos grows;
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>The Spring was new, and all the verdant boughs,
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>Acorn'd with blossoms, promis'd fruits that vye
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>In glowing colours with the Tyrian dye.
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>Of these she cropt, to please her infant son,
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>And I my self the same rash act had done,
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>But, lo! I saw (as near her side I stood)
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>The violated blossoms drop with blood;
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>Upon the tree I cast a frightful look,
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>The trembling tree with sudden horror shook.
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>Lotis the nymph (if rural tales be true)
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>As from Priapus' lawless lust she flew,
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>Forsook her form; and fixing here became
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>A flow'ry plant, which still preserves her name.
<A NAME="461"></A><BR><BR>This change unknown, astonish'd at the sight,
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>My trembling sister strove to urge her flight;
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>Yet first the pardon of the Nymphs implor'd,
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>And those offended Sylvan pow'rs ador'd:
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>But when she backward would have fled, she found
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>Her stiff'ning feet were rooted to the ground:
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>In vain to free her fasten'd feet she strove,
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>And as she struggles only moves above;
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>She feels th' incroaching bark around her grow,
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>By slow degrees, and cover all below:
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>Surpriz'd at this, her trembling hand she heaves
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>To rend her hair; her hand is fill'd with leaves;
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>Where late was hair, the shooting leaves are seen
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>To rise, and shade her with a sudden green.
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>The Child Amphisus, to her bosom prest,
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>Perceiv'd a colder and a harder breast,
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>And found the springs, that n'er 'till then deny'd
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>Their milky moisture, on a sudden dry'd.
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>I saw, unhappy, what I now relate,
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>And stood the helpless witness of thy fate;
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>Embrac'd thy boughs, the rising bark delay'd,
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>There wish'd to grow, and mingle shade with shade.
<A NAME="483"></A><BR><BR>Behold Andraemon, and th' unhappy sire
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>Appear, and for their Dryope enquire;
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>A springing tree for Dryope they find,
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>And print warm kisses on the panting rind;
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>Prostrate, with tears their kindred plant bedew,
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>And close embrac'd, as to the roots they grew;
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>The face was all that now remain'd of thee;
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>No more a woman, nor yet quite a tree:
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>Thy branches hung with humid pearls appear,
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>From ev'ry leaf distills a trickling tear;
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>And strait a voice, while yet a voice remains,
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>Thus thro' the trembling boughs in sighs complains.
<A NAME="495"></A><BR><BR>If to the wretched any faith be giv'n,
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>I swear by all th' unpitying Pow'rs of Heav'n,
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>No wilful crime this heavy vengeance bred,
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>In mutual innocence our lives we led.
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>If this be false, let these new greens decay,
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>Let sounding axes lop my limbs away,
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>And crackling flames on all my honours prey.
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>Now from my branching arms this infant bear,
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>Let some kind nurse supply a mother's care;
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>Yet to his mother let him oft be led,
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>Sport in her shades, and in her shades be fed;
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>Teach him, when first his infant voice shall frame
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>Imperfect words, and lisp his mother's name,
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>To hail this tree, and say with weeping eyes,
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>Within this plant my hapless parent lies;
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>And when in youth he seeks the shady woods,
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>Oh, let him fly the chrystal lakes and floods,
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>Nor touch the fatal flow'rs; but warn'd by me,
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>Believe a Goddess shrin'd in ev'ry tree.
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>My sire, my sister, and my spouse farewel!
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>If in your breasts or love, or pity, dwell,
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>Protect your plant, nor let my branches feel
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>The browzing cattle, or the piercing steel.
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>Farewel! and since I cannot bend to join
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>My lips to yours, advance at least to mine.
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>My son, thy mother's parting kiss receive,
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>While yet thy mother has a kiss to give.
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>I can no more; the creeping rind invades
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>My closing lips, and hides my head in shades:
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>Remove your hands; the bark shall soon suffice,
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>Without their aid, to seal these dying eyes.
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>She ceas'd at once to speak, and ceas'd to be;
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>And all the nymph was lost within the tree:
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>Yet latent life thro' her new branches reign'd,
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>And long the plant a human heat retain'd.
<A NAME="530"></A><BR><BR><B>Iolaus restor'd to Youth</B>
<A NAME="531"></A><BR><BR>While Iole the fatal change declares,
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>Alcmena's pitying hand oft wip'd her tears.
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>Grief too stream'd down her cheeks; soon sorrow 
<A NAME="534"></A>flies,
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>And rising joy the trickling moisture dries,
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>Lo Iolaus stands before their eyes.
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>A youth he stood; and the soft down began
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>O'er his smooth chin to spread, and promise man.
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>Hebe submitted to her husband's pray'rs,
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>Instill'd new vigour, and restor'd his years.
<A NAME="541"></A><BR><BR><B>The Prophecy of Themis</B>
<A NAME="542"></A><BR><BR>Now from her lips a solemn oath had past,
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>That Iolaus this gift alone shou'd taste,
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>Had not just Themis thus maturely said
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>(Which check'd her vow, and aw'd the blooming maid).
<A NAME="546"></A><BR><BR>Thebes is embroil'd in war. Capaneus stands
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>Invincible, but by the Thund'rer's hands.
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>Ambition shall the guilty brothers fire,
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>Both rush to mutual wounds, and both expire.
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>The reeling Earth shall ope her gloomy womb,
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>Where the yet breathing bard shall find his tomb.
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>The son shall bath his hands in parents' blood,
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>And in one act be both unjust, and good.
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>Of home, and sense depriv'd, where-e'er he flies,
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>The Furies, and his mother's ghost he spies.
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>His wife the fatal bracelet shall implore,
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>And Phegeus stain his sword in kindred gore.
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>Callirhoe shall then with suppliant pray'r
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>Prevail on Jupiter's relenting ear.
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>Jove shall with youth her infant sons inspire,
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>And bid their bosoms glow with manly fire.
<A NAME="562"></A><BR><BR><B>The Debate of the Gods</B>
<A NAME="563"></A><BR><BR>When Themis thus with prescient voice had spoke,
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>Among the Gods a various murmur broke;
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>Dissention rose in each immortal breast,
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>That one should grant, what was deny'd the rest.
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>Aurora for her aged spouse complains,
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>And Ceres grieves for Jason's freezing veins;
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>Vulcan would Erichthonius' years renew,
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>Her future race the care of Venus drew,
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>She would Anchises' blooming age restore;
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>A diff'rent care employ'd each heav'nly Pow'r:
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>Thus various int'rests did their jars encrease,
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>'Till Jove arose; he spoke, their tumults cease.
<A NAME="575"></A><BR><BR>Is any rev'rence to our presence giv'n,
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>Then why this discord 'mong the Pow'rs of Heav'n?
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>Who can the settled will of Fate subdue?
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>'Twas by the Fates that Iolaus knew
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>A second youth. The Fates' determin'd doom
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>Shall give Callirhoe's race a youthful bloom.
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>Arms, nor ambition can this pow'r obtain;
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>Quell your desires; ev'n me the Fates restrain.
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>Could I their will controul, no rolling years
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>Had Aeacus bent down with silver hairs;
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>Then Rhadamanthus still had youth possess'd,
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>And Minos with eternal bloom been bless'd.
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>Jove's words the synod mov'd; the Pow'rs give o'er,
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>And urge in vain unjust complaint no more.
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>Since Rhadamanthus' veins now slowly flow'd,
<A NAME="590"></A><BR>And Aeacus, and Minos bore the load;
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>Minos, who in the flow'r of youth, and fame,
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>Made mighty nations tremble at his name,
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>Infirm with age, the proud Miletus fears,
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>Vain of his birth, and in the strength of years,
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>And now regarding all his realms as lost,
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>He durst not force him from his native coast.
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>But you by choice, Miletus, fled his reign,
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>And thy swift vessel plow'd th' Aegean main;
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>On Asiatick shores a town you frame,
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>Which still is honour'd with the founder's name.
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>Here you Cyanee knew, the beauteous maid,
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>As on her father's winding banks she stray'd:
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>Caunus and Byblis hence their lineage trace,
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>The double offspring of your warm embrace.
<A NAME="605"></A><BR><BR><B>The Passion of of Byblis</B>
<A NAME="606"></A><BR><BR>Let the sad fate of wretched Byblis prove
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>A dismal warning to unlawful love;
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>One birth gave being to the hapless pair,
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>But more was Caunus than a sister's care;
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>Unknown she lov'd, for yet the gentle fire
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>Rose not in flames, nor kindled to desire,
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>'Twas thought no sin to wonder at his charms,
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>Hang on his neck, and languish in his arms;
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>Thus wing'd with joy, fled the soft hours away,
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>And all the fatal guilt on harmless Nature lay.
<A NAME="616"></A><BR><BR>But love (too soon from piety declin'd)
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>Insensibly deprav'd her yielding mind.
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>Dress'd she appears, with nicest art adorn'd,
<A NAME="619"></A><BR>And ev'ry youth, but her lov'd brother, scorn'd;
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>For him alone she labour'd to be fair,
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>And curst all charms that might with hers compare.
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>'Twas she, and only she, must Caunus please,
<A NAME="623"></A><BR>Sick at her heart, yet knew not her disease:
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>She call'd him lord, for brother was a name
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>Too cold, and dull for her aspiring flame;
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>And when he spoke, if sister he reply'd,
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>For Byblis change that frozen word, she cry'd.
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>Yet waking still she watch'd her strugling breast,
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>And love's approaches were in vain address'd,
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>'Till gentle sleep an easy conquest made,
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>And in her soft embrace the conqueror was laid.
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>But oh too soon the pleasing vision fled,
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>And left her blushing on the conscious bed:
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>Ah me! (she cry'd) how monstrous do I seem?
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>Why these wild thoughts? and this incestuous dream?
<A NAME="636"></A><BR>Envy herself ('tis true) must own his charms,
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>But what is beauty in a sister's arms?
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>Oh were I not that despicable she,
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>How bless'd, how pleas'd, how happy shou'd I be!
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>But unregarded now must bear my pain,
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>And but in dreams, my wishes can obtain.
<A NAME="642"></A><BR><BR>O sea-born Goddess! with thy wanton boy!
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>Was ever such a charming scene of joy?
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>Such perfect bliss! such ravishing delight!
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>Ne'er hid before in the kind shades of night.
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>How pleas'd my heart! in what sweet raptures tost!
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>Ev'n life it self in the soft combat lost,
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>While breathless he on my heav'd bosom lay,
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>And snatch'd the treasures of my soul away.
<A NAME="650"></A><BR><BR>If the bare fancy so affects my mind,
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>How shou'd I rave if to the substance join'd?
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>Oh, gentle Caunus! quit thy hated line,
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>Or let thy parents be no longer mine!
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>Oh that in common all things were enjoy'd,
<A NAME="655"></A><BR>But those alone who have our hopes destroy'd.
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>Were I a princess, thou an humble swain,
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>The proudest kings shou'd rival thee in vain.
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>It cannot be, alas! the dreadful ill
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>Is fix'd by Fate, and he's my brother still.
<A NAME="660"></A><BR>Hear me, ye Gods! I must have friends in Heav'n,
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>For Jove himself was to a sister giv'n:
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>But what are their prerogatives above,
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>To the short liberties of human love?
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>Fantastick thoughts! down, down, forbidden fires,
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>Or instant death extinguish my desires.
<A NAME="666"></A><BR>Strict virtue, then, with thy malicious leave,
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>Without a crime I may a kiss receive:
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>But say shou'd I in spight of laws comply,
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>Yet cruel Caunus might himself deny,
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>No pity take of an afflicted maid
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>(For love's sweet game must be by couples play'd).
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>Yet why shou'd youth, and charms like mine, despair?
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>Such fears ne'er startled the Aeolian pair;
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>No ties of blood could their full hopes destroy,
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>They broke thro' all, for the prevailing joy;
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>And who can tell but Caunus too may be
<A NAME="677"></A><BR>Rack'd and tormented in his breast for me?
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>Like me, to the extreamest anguish drove,
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>Like me, just waking from a dream of love?
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>But stay! Oh whither wou'd my fury run!
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>What arguments I urge to be undone!
<A NAME="682"></A><BR>Away fond Byblis, quench these guilty flames;
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>Caunus thy love but as brother claims;
<A NAME="684"></A><BR>Yet had he first been touch'd with love of me,
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>The charming youth cou'd I despairing see?
<A NAME="686"></A><BR>Oppress'd with grief, and dying by disdain?
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>Ah no! too sure I shou'd have eas'd his pain!
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>Since then, if Caunus ask'd me, it were done;
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>Asking my self, what dangers can I run?
<A NAME="690"></A><BR>But canst thou ask? and see that right betray'd,
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>From Pyrrha down to thy whole sex convey'd?
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>That self-denying gift we all enjoy,
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>Of wishing to be won, yet seeming to be coy.
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>Well then, for once, let a fond mistress woo;
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>The force of love no custom can subdue;
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>This frantick passion he by words shall know,
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>Soft as the melting heart from whence they flow.
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>The pencil then in her fair hand she held,
<A NAME="699"></A><BR>By fear discourag'd, but by love compell'd
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>She writes, then blots, writes on, and blots again,
<A NAME="701"></A><BR>Likes it as fit, then razes it as vain:
<A NAME="702"></A><BR>Shame, and assurance in her face appear,
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>And a faint hope just yielding to despair;
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>Sister was wrote, and blotted as a word
<A NAME="705"></A><BR>Which she, and Caunus too (she hop'd) abhorr'd;
<A NAME="706"></A><BR>But now resolv'd to be no more controul'd
<A NAME="707"></A><BR>By scrup'lous virtue, thus her grief she told.
<A NAME="708"></A><BR><BR>Thy lover (gentle Caunus) wishes thee
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>That health, which thou alone canst give to me.
<A NAME="710"></A><BR>O charming youth! the gift I ask bestow,
<A NAME="711"></A><BR>Ere thou the name of the fond writer know;
<A NAME="712"></A><BR>To thee without a name I would be known,
<A NAME="713"></A><BR>Since knowing that, my frailty I must own.
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>Yet why shou'd I my wretched name conceal?
<A NAME="715"></A><BR>When thousand instances my flames reveal:
<A NAME="716"></A><BR>Wan looks, and weeping eyes have spoke my pain,
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>And sighs discharg'd from my heav'd heart in vain;
<A NAME="718"></A><BR>Had I not wish'd my passion might be seen,
<A NAME="719"></A><BR>What cou'd such fondness and embraces mean?
<A NAME="720"></A><BR>Such kisses too! (Oh heedless lovely boy)
<A NAME="721"></A><BR>Without a crime no sister cou'd enjoy:
<A NAME="722"></A><BR>Yet (tho' extreamest rage has rack'd my soul,
<A NAME="723"></A><BR>And raging fires in my parch'd bosom roul)
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>Be witness, Gods! how piously I strove,
<A NAME="725"></A><BR>To rid my thoughts of this enchanting love.
<A NAME="726"></A><BR>But who cou'd scape so fierce, and sure a dart,
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>Aim'd at a tender, and defenceless heart?
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>Alas! what maid cou'd suffer, I have born,
<A NAME="729"></A><BR>Ere the dire secret from my breast was torn;
<A NAME="730"></A><BR>To thee a helpless vanquish'd wretch I come,
<A NAME="731"></A><BR>'Tis you alone can save, or give my doom;
<A NAME="732"></A><BR>My life, or death this moment you may chuse.
<A NAME="733"></A><BR>Yet think, oh think, no hated stranger sues,
<A NAME="734"></A><BR>No foe; but one, alas! too near ally'd,
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>And wishing still much nearer to be ty'd.
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>The forms of decency let age debate,
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>And virtue's rules by their cold morals state;
<A NAME="738"></A><BR>Their ebbing joys give leisure to enquire,
<A NAME="739"></A><BR>And blame those noble flights our youth inspire:
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>Where Nature kindly summons let us go,
<A NAME="741"></A><BR>Our sprightly years no bounds in love shou'd know,
<A NAME="742"></A><BR>Shou'd feel no check of guilt, and fear no ill;
<A NAME="743"></A><BR>Lovers, and Gods act all things at their will:
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>We gain one blessing from our hated kin,
<A NAME="745"></A><BR>Since our paternal freedom hides the sin;
<A NAME="746"></A><BR>Uncensur'd in each other's arms we lye,
<A NAME="747"></A><BR>Think then how easie to compleat our joy.
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>Oh, pardon and oblige a blushing maid,
<A NAME="749"></A><BR>Whose rage the pride of her vain sex betray'd;
<A NAME="750"></A><BR>Nor let my tomb thus mournfully complain,
<A NAME="751"></A><BR>Here Byblis lies, by her lov'd Caunus slain.
<A NAME="752"></A><BR><BR>Forc'd here to end, she with a falling tear
<A NAME="753"></A><BR>Temper'd the pliant wax, which did the signet bear:
<A NAME="754"></A><BR>The curious cypher was impress'd by art,
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>But love had stamp'd one deeper in her heart;
<A NAME="756"></A><BR>Her page, a youth of confidence, and skill,
<A NAME="757"></A><BR>(Secret as night) stood waiting on her will;
<A NAME="758"></A><BR>Sighing (she cry'd): Bear this, thou faithful boy,
<A NAME="759"></A><BR>To my sweet partner in eternal joy:
<A NAME="760"></A><BR>Here a long pause her secret guilt confess'd,
<A NAME="761"></A><BR>And when at length she would have spoke the rest,
<A NAME="762"></A><BR>Half the dear name lay bury'd in her breast.
<A NAME="763"></A><BR><BR>Thus as he listned to her vain command,
<A NAME="764"></A><BR>Down fell the letter from her trembling hand.
<A NAME="765"></A><BR>The omen shock'd her soul. Yet go, she cry'd;
<A NAME="766"></A><BR>Can a request from Byblis be deny'd?
<A NAME="767"></A><BR><BR>To the Maeandrian youth this message's born,
<A NAME="768"></A><BR>The half-read lines by his fierce rage were torn;
<A NAME="769"></A><BR>Hence, hence, he cry'd, thou pandar to her lust,
<A NAME="770"></A><BR>Bear hence the triumph of thy impious trust:
<A NAME="771"></A><BR>Thy instant death will but divulge her shame,
<A NAME="772"></A><BR>Or thy life's blood shou'd quench the guilty flame.
<A NAME="773"></A><BR>Frighted, from threatning Caunus he withdrew,
<A NAME="774"></A><BR>And with the dreadful news to his lost mistress 
<A NAME="775"></A>flew.
<A NAME="776"></A><BR>The sad repulse so struck the wounded fair,
<A NAME="777"></A><BR>Her sense was bury'd in her wild despair;
<A NAME="778"></A><BR>Pale was her visage, as the ghastly dead;
<A NAME="779"></A><BR>And her scar'd soul from the sweet mansion fled;
<A NAME="780"></A><BR>Yet with her life renew'd, her love returns,
<A NAME="781"></A><BR>And faintly thus her cruel fate she mourns:
<A NAME="782"></A><BR>'Tis just, ye Gods! was my false reason blind?
<A NAME="783"></A><BR>To write a secret of this tender kind?
<A NAME="784"></A><BR>With female craft I shou'd at first have strove,
<A NAME="785"></A><BR>By dubious hints to sound his distant love;
<A NAME="786"></A><BR>And try'd those useful, tho' dissembled, arts,
<A NAME="787"></A><BR>Which women practise on disdainful hearts:
<A NAME="788"></A><BR>I shou'd have watch'd whence the black storm might 
<A NAME="789"></A>rise;
<A NAME="790"></A><BR>Ere I had trusted the unfaithful skies.
<A NAME="791"></A><BR>Now on the rouling billows I am tost,
<A NAME="792"></A><BR>And with extended sails, on the blind shelves am 
<A NAME="793"></A>lost.
<A NAME="794"></A><BR>Did not indulgent Heav'n my doom foretell,
<A NAME="795"></A><BR>When from my hand the fatal letter fell?
<A NAME="796"></A><BR>What madness seiz'd my soul? and urg'd me on
<A NAME="797"></A><BR>To take the only course to be undone?
<A NAME="798"></A><BR>I cou'd my self have told the moving tale
<A NAME="799"></A><BR>With such alluring grace as must prevail;
<A NAME="800"></A><BR>Then had his eyes beheld my blushing fears,
<A NAME="801"></A><BR>My rising sighs, and my descending tears;
<A NAME="802"></A><BR>Round his dear neck these arms I then had spread,
<A NAME="803"></A><BR>And, if rejected, at his feet been dead:
<A NAME="804"></A><BR>If singly these had not his thoughts inclin'd,
<A NAME="805"></A><BR>Yet all united would have shock'd his mind.
<A NAME="806"></A><BR>Perhaps, my careless page might be in fault,
<A NAME="807"></A><BR>And in a luckless hour the fatal message brought;
<A NAME="808"></A><BR>Business, and worldly thoughts might fill his breast,
<A NAME="809"></A><BR>Sometimes ev'n love itself may be an irksome guest:
<A NAME="810"></A><BR>He cou'd not else have treated me with scorn,
<A NAME="811"></A><BR>For Caunus was not of a tygress born;
<A NAME="812"></A><BR>Nor steel, nor adamant has fenc'd his heart;
<A NAME="813"></A><BR>Like mine, 'tis naked to the burning dart.
<A NAME="814"></A><BR><BR>Away false fears! he must, he shall be mine;
<A NAME="815"></A><BR>In death alone I will my claim resign;
<A NAME="816"></A><BR>'Tis vain to wish my written crime unknown,
<A NAME="817"></A><BR>And for my guilt much vainer to atone.
<A NAME="818"></A><BR>Repuls'd and baffled, fiercer still she burns,
<A NAME="819"></A><BR>And Caunus with disdain her impious love returns.
<A NAME="820"></A><BR>He saw no end of her injurious flame,
<A NAME="821"></A><BR>And fled his country to avoid the shame.
<A NAME="822"></A><BR>Forsaken Byblis, who had hopes no more;
<A NAME="823"></A><BR>Burst out in rage, and her loose robes she tore;
<A NAME="824"></A><BR>With her fair hands she smote her tender breast,
<A NAME="825"></A><BR>And to the wond'ring world her love confess'd;
<A NAME="826"></A><BR>O'er hills and dales, o'er rocks and streams she 
<A NAME="827"></A>flew,
<A NAME="828"></A><BR>But still in vain did her wild lust pursue:
<A NAME="829"></A><BR>Wearied at length, on the cold earth she fell,
<A NAME="830"></A><BR>And now in tears alone could her sad story tell.
<A NAME="831"></A><BR>Relenting Gods in pity fix'd her there,
<A NAME="832"></A><BR>And to a fountain turn'd the weeping fair.
<A NAME="833"></A><BR><BR><B>The Fable of Iphis and Ianthe</B>
<A NAME="834"></A><BR><BR>The fame of this, perhaps, thro' Crete had flown:
<A NAME="835"></A><BR>But Crete had newer wonders of her own,
<A NAME="836"></A><BR>In Iphis chang'd; for, near the Gnossian bounds
<A NAME="837"></A><BR>(As loud report the miracle resounds),
<A NAME="838"></A><BR>At Phaestus dwelt a man of honest blood,
<A NAME="839"></A><BR>But meanly born, and not so rich as good;
<A NAME="840"></A><BR>Esteem'd, and lov'd by all the neighbourhood;
<A NAME="841"></A><BR>Who to his wife, before the time assign'd
<A NAME="842"></A><BR>For child-birth came, thus bluntly spoke his mind.
<A NAME="843"></A><BR>If Heav'n, said Lygdus, will vouchsafe to hear,
<A NAME="844"></A><BR>I have but two petitions to prefer;
<A NAME="845"></A><BR>Short pains for thee, for me a son and heir.
<A NAME="846"></A><BR>Girls cost as many throes in bringing forth;
<A NAME="847"></A><BR>Beside, when born, the titts are little worth;
<A NAME="848"></A><BR>Weak puling things, unable to sustain
<A NAME="849"></A><BR>Their share of labour, and their bread to gain.
<A NAME="850"></A><BR>If, therefore, thou a creature shalt produce,
<A NAME="851"></A><BR>Of so great charges, and so little use
<A NAME="852"></A><BR>(Bear witness, Heav'n, with what reluctancy),
<A NAME="853"></A><BR>Her hapless innocence I doom to die.
<A NAME="854"></A><BR>He said, and common tears the common grief display,
<A NAME="855"></A><BR>Of him who bad, and her who must obey.
<A NAME="856"></A><BR><BR>Yet Telethusa still persists, to find
<A NAME="857"></A><BR>Fit arguments to move a father's mind;
<A NAME="858"></A><BR>T' extend his wishes to a larger scope,
<A NAME="859"></A><BR>And in one vessel not confine his hope.
<A NAME="860"></A><BR>Lygdus continues hard: her time drew near,
<A NAME="861"></A><BR>And she her heavy load could scarcely bear;
<A NAME="862"></A><BR>When slumbring, in the latter shades of night,
<A NAME="863"></A><BR>Before th' approaches of returning light,
<A NAME="864"></A><BR>She saw, or thought she saw, before her bed,
<A NAME="865"></A><BR>A glorious train, and Isis at their head:
<A NAME="866"></A><BR>Her moony horns were on her forehead plac'd,
<A NAME="867"></A><BR>And yellow shelves her shining temples grac'd:
<A NAME="868"></A><BR>A mitre, for a crown, she wore on high;
<A NAME="869"></A><BR>The dog, and dappl'd bull were waiting by;
<A NAME="870"></A><BR>Osyris, sought along the banks of Nile;
<A NAME="871"></A><BR>The silent God: the sacred crocodile;
<A NAME="872"></A><BR>And, last, a long procession moving on,
<A NAME="873"></A><BR>With timbrels, that assist the lab'ring moon.
<A NAME="874"></A><BR>Her slumbers seem'd dispell'd, and, broad awake,
<A NAME="875"></A><BR>She heard a voice, that thus distinctly spake.
<A NAME="876"></A><BR>My votary, thy babe from death defend,
<A NAME="877"></A><BR>Nor fear to save whate'er the Gods will send.
<A NAME="878"></A><BR>Delude with art thy husband's dire decree:
<A NAME="879"></A><BR>When danger calls, repose thy trust on me:
<A NAME="880"></A><BR>And know thou hast not serv'd a thankless deity.
<A NAME="881"></A><BR>This promise made, with night the Goddess fled;
<A NAME="882"></A><BR>With joy the woman wakes, and leaves her bed;
<A NAME="883"></A><BR>Devoutly lifts her spotless hands on high,
<A NAME="884"></A><BR>And prays the Pow'rs their gift to ratifie.
<A NAME="885"></A><BR><BR>Now grinding pains proceed to bearing throes,
<A NAME="886"></A><BR>'Till its own weight the burden did disclose.
<A NAME="887"></A><BR>'Twas of the beauteous kind, and brought to light
<A NAME="888"></A><BR>With secrecy, to shun the father's sight.
<A NAME="889"></A><BR>Th' indulgent mother did her care employ,
<A NAME="890"></A><BR>And past it on her husband for a boy.
<A NAME="891"></A><BR>The nurse was conscious of the fact alone;
<A NAME="892"></A><BR>The father paid his vows as for a son;
<A NAME="893"></A><BR>And call'd him Iphis, by a common name,
<A NAME="894"></A><BR>Which either sex with equal right may claim.
<A NAME="895"></A><BR>Iphis his grandsire was; the wife was pleas'd,
<A NAME="896"></A><BR>Of half the fraud by Fortune's favour eas'd:
<A NAME="897"></A><BR>The doubtful name was us'd without deceit,
<A NAME="898"></A><BR>And truth was cover'd with a pious cheat.
<A NAME="899"></A><BR>The habit show'd a boy, the beauteous face
<A NAME="900"></A><BR>With manly fierceness mingled female grace.
<A NAME="901"></A><BR><BR>Now thirteen years of age were swiftly run,
<A NAME="902"></A><BR>When the fond father thought the time drew on
<A NAME="903"></A><BR>Of settling in the world his only son.
<A NAME="904"></A><BR>Ianthe was his choice; so wondrous fair,
<A NAME="905"></A><BR>Her form alone with Iphis cou'd compare;
<A NAME="906"></A><BR>A neighbour's daughter of his own degree,
<A NAME="907"></A><BR>And not more bless'd with Fortune's goods than he.
<A NAME="908"></A><BR><BR>They soon espous'd; for they with ease were 
<A NAME="909"></A>join'd,
<A NAME="910"></A><BR>Who were before contracted in the mind.
<A NAME="911"></A><BR>Their age the same, their inclinations too;
<A NAME="912"></A><BR>And bred together, in one school they grew.
<A NAME="913"></A><BR>Thus, fatally dispos'd to mutual fires,
<A NAME="914"></A><BR>They felt, before they knew, the same desires.
<A NAME="915"></A><BR>Equal their flame, unequal was their care;
<A NAME="916"></A><BR>One lov'd with hope, one languish'd in despair.
<A NAME="917"></A><BR>The maid accus'd the lingring day alone:
<A NAME="918"></A><BR>For whom she thought a man, she thought her own.
<A NAME="919"></A><BR>But Iphis bends beneath a greater grief;
<A NAME="920"></A><BR>As fiercely burns, but hopes for no relief.
<A NAME="921"></A><BR>Ev'n her despair adds fuel to her fire;
<A NAME="922"></A><BR>A maid with madness does a maid desire.
<A NAME="923"></A><BR>And, scarce refraining tears, Alas, said she,
<A NAME="924"></A><BR>What issue of my love remains for me!
<A NAME="925"></A><BR>How wild a passion works within my breast,
<A NAME="926"></A><BR>With what prodigious flames am I possest!
<A NAME="927"></A><BR>Could I the care of Providence deserve,
<A NAME="928"></A><BR>Heav'n must destroy me, if it would preserve.
<A NAME="929"></A><BR>And that's my fate, or sure it would have sent
<A NAME="930"></A><BR>Some usual evil for my punishment:
<A NAME="931"></A><BR>Not this unkindly curse; to rage, and burn,
<A NAME="932"></A><BR>Where Nature shews no prospect of return.
<A NAME="933"></A><BR>Nor cows for cows consume with fruitless fire;
<A NAME="934"></A><BR>Nor mares, when hot, their fellow-mares desire:
<A NAME="935"></A><BR>The father of the fold supplies his ewes;
<A NAME="936"></A><BR>The stag through secret woods his hind pursues;
<A NAME="937"></A><BR>And birds for mates the males of their own species 
<A NAME="938"></A>chuse.
<A NAME="939"></A><BR>Her females Nature guards from female flame,
<A NAME="940"></A><BR>And joins two sexes to preserve the game:
<A NAME="941"></A><BR>Wou'd I were nothing, or not what I am!
<A NAME="942"></A><BR>Crete, fam'd for monsters, wanted of her store,
<A NAME="943"></A><BR>'Till my new love produc'd one monster more.
<A NAME="944"></A><BR>The daughter of the sun a bull desir'd,
<A NAME="945"></A><BR>And yet ev'n then a male a female fir'd:
<A NAME="946"></A><BR>Her passion was extravagantly new,
<A NAME="947"></A><BR>But mine is much the madder of the two.
<A NAME="948"></A><BR>To things impossible she was not bent,
<A NAME="949"></A><BR>But found the means to compass her intent.
<A NAME="950"></A><BR>To cheat his eyes she took a different shape;
<A NAME="951"></A><BR>Yet still she gain'd a lover, and a leap.
<A NAME="952"></A><BR>Shou'd all the wit of all the world conspire,
<A NAME="953"></A><BR>Shou'd Daedalus assist my wild desire,
<A NAME="954"></A><BR>What art can make me able to enjoy,
<A NAME="955"></A><BR>Or what can change Ianthe to a boy?
<A NAME="956"></A><BR>Extinguish then thy passion, hopeless maid,
<A NAME="957"></A><BR>And recollect thy reason for thy aid.
<A NAME="958"></A><BR>Know what thou art, and love as maidens ought,
<A NAME="959"></A><BR>And drive these golden wishes from thy thought.
<A NAME="960"></A><BR>Thou canst not hope thy fond desires to gain;
<A NAME="961"></A><BR>Where hope is wanting, wishes are in vain.
<A NAME="962"></A><BR><BR>And yet no guards against our joys conspire;
<A NAME="963"></A><BR>No jealous husband hinders our desire;
<A NAME="964"></A><BR>My parents are propitious to my wish,
<A NAME="965"></A><BR>And she herself consenting to the bliss.
<A NAME="966"></A><BR>All things concur to prosper our design;
<A NAME="967"></A><BR>All things to prosper any love but mine.
<A NAME="968"></A><BR>And yet I never can enjoy the fair;
<A NAME="969"></A><BR>'Tis past the pow'r of Heav'n to grant my pray'r.
<A NAME="970"></A><BR>Heav'n has been kind, as far as Heav'n can be;
<A NAME="971"></A><BR>Our parents with our own desires agree;
<A NAME="972"></A><BR>But Nature, stronger than the Gods above,
<A NAME="973"></A><BR>Refuses her assistance to my love;
<A NAME="974"></A><BR>She sets the bar that causes all my pain;
<A NAME="975"></A><BR>One gift refus'd, makes all their bounty vain.
<A NAME="976"></A><BR>And now the happy day is just at hand,
<A NAME="977"></A><BR>To bind our hearts in Hymen's holy band:
<A NAME="978"></A><BR>Our hearts, but not our bodies: thus accurs'd,
<A NAME="979"></A><BR>In midst of water I complain of thirst.
<A NAME="980"></A><BR>Why com'st thou, Juno, to these barren rites,
<A NAME="981"></A><BR>To bless a bed defrauded of delights?
<A NAME="982"></A><BR>But why shou'd Hymen lift his torch on high,
<A NAME="983"></A><BR>To see two brides in cold embraces lye?
<A NAME="984"></A><BR><BR>Thus love-sick Iphis her vain passion mourns;
<A NAME="985"></A><BR>With equal ardour fair Ianthe burns,
<A NAME="986"></A><BR>Invoking Hymen's name, and Juno's pow'r,
<A NAME="987"></A><BR>To speed the work, and haste the happy hour.
<A NAME="988"></A><BR><BR>She hopes, while Telethusa fears the day,
<A NAME="989"></A><BR>And strives to interpose some new delay:
<A NAME="990"></A><BR>Now feigns a sickness, now is in a fright
<A NAME="991"></A><BR>For this bad omen, or that boding sight.
<A NAME="992"></A><BR>But having done whate'er she could devise,
<A NAME="993"></A><BR>And empty'd all her magazine of lies,
<A NAME="994"></A><BR>The time approach'd; the next ensuing day
<A NAME="995"></A><BR>The fatal secret must to light betray.
<A NAME="996"></A><BR>Then Telethusa had recourse to pray'r,
<A NAME="997"></A><BR>She, and her daughter with dishevel'd hair;
<A NAME="998"></A><BR>Trembling with fear, great Isis they ador'd,
<A NAME="999"></A><BR>Embrac'd her altar, and her aid implor'd.
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR><BR>Fair queen, who dost on fruitful Egypt smile,
<A NAME="1001"></A><BR>Who sway'st the sceptre of the Pharian isle,
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR>And sev'n-fold falls of disemboguing Nile,
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR>Relieve, in this our last distress, she said,
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR>A suppliant mother, and a mournful maid.
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR>Thou, Goddess, thou wert present to my sight;
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR>Reveal'd I saw thee by thy own fair light:
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR>I saw thee in my dream, as now I see,
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR>With all thy marks of awful majesty:
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR>The glorious train that compass'd thee around;
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR>And heard the hollow timbrels holy sound.
<A NAME="1011"></A><BR>Thy words I noted, which I still retain;
<A NAME="1012"></A><BR>Let not thy sacred oracles be vain.
<A NAME="1013"></A><BR>That Iphis lives, that I myself am free
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR>From shame, and punishment, I owe to thee.
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR>On thy protection all our hopes depend.
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR>Thy counsel sav'd us, let thy pow'r defend.
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR><BR>Her tears pursu'd her words; and while she spoke,
<A NAME="1018"></A><BR>The Goddess nodded, and her altar shook:
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR>The temple doors, as with a blast of wind,
<A NAME="1020"></A><BR>Were heard to clap; the lunar horns that bind
<A NAME="1021"></A><BR>The brows of Isis cast a blaze around;
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR>The trembling timbrel made a murm'ring sound.
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR><BR>Some hopes these happy omens did impart;
<A NAME="1024"></A><BR>Forth went the mother with a beating heart:
<A NAME="1025"></A><BR>Not much in fear, nor fully satisfy'd;
<A NAME="1026"></A><BR>But Iphis follow'd with a larger stride:
<A NAME="1027"></A><BR>The whiteness of her skin forsook her face;
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR>Her looks embolden'd with an awful grace;
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR>Her features, and her strength together grew,
<A NAME="1030"></A><BR>And her long hair to curling locks withdrew.
<A NAME="1031"></A><BR>Her sparkling eyes with manly vigour shone,
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR>Big was her voice, audacious was her tone.
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR>The latent parts, at length reveal'd, began
<A NAME="1034"></A><BR>To shoot, and spread, and burnish into man.
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR>The maid becomes a youth; no more delay
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR>Your vows, but look, and confidently pay.
<A NAME="1037"></A><BR>Their gifts the parents to the temple bear:
<A NAME="1038"></A><BR>The votive tables this inscription wear;
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR>Iphis the man, has to the Goddess paid
<A NAME="1040"></A><BR>The vows, that Iphis offer'd when a maid.
<A NAME="1041"></A><BR><BR>Now when the star of day had shewn his face,
<A NAME="1042"></A><BR>Venus and Juno with their presence grace
<A NAME="1043"></A><BR>The nuptial rites, and Hymen from above
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR>Descending to compleat their happy love;
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR>The Gods of marriage lend their mutual aid;
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR>And the warm youth enjoys the lovely maid.
