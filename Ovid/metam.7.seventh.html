<A NAME="start"></A>
<A NAME="10"></A><B>The Story of Medea and Jason</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>The Argonauts now stemm'd the foaming tide,
<A NAME="12"></A><BR>And to Arcadia's shore their course apply'd;
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>Where sightless Phineus spent his age in grief,
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>But Boreas' sons engage in his relief;
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>And those unwelcome guests, the odious race
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>Of Harpyes, from the monarch's table chase.
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>With Jason then they greater toils sustain,
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>And Phasis' slimy banks at last they gain,
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>Here boldly they demand the golden prize
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>Of Scythia's king, who sternly thus replies:
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>That mighty labours they must first o'ercome,
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>Or sail their Argo thence unfreighted home.
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>Meanwhile Medea, seiz'd with fierce desire,
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>By reason strives to quench the raging fire;
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>But strives in vain!- Some God (she said) withstands,
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>And reason's baffl'd council countermands.
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>What unseen Pow'r does this disorder move?
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>'Tis love,- at least 'tis like, what men call love.
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>Else wherefore shou'd the king's commands appear
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>To me too hard?- But so indeed they are.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>Why shou'd I for a stranger fear, lest he
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>Shou'd perish, whom I did but lately see?
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>His death, or safety, what are they to me?
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>Wretch, from thy virgin-breast this flame expel,
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>And soon- Oh cou'd I, all wou'd then be well!
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>But love, resistless love, my soul invades;
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>Discretion this, affection that perswades.
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>I see the right, and I approve it too,
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>Condemn the wrong- and yet the wrong pursue.
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>Why, royal maid, shou'dst thou desire to wed
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>A wanderer, and court a foreign bed?
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>Thy native land, tho' barb'rous, can present
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>A bridegroom worth a royal bride's content:
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>And whether this advent'rer lives, or dies,
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>In Fate, and Fortune's fickle pleasure lies.
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>Yet may be live! for to the Pow'rs above,
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>A virgin, led by no impulse of love,
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>So just a suit may, for the guiltless, move.
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>Whom wou'd not Jason's valour, youth and blood
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>Invite? or cou'd these merits be withstood,
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>At least his charming person must encline
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>The hardest heart- I'm sure 'tis so with mine!
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>Yet, if I help him not, the flaming breath
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>Of bulls, and earth-born foes, must be his death.
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>Or, should he through these dangers force his way,
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>At last he must be made the dragon's prey.
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>If no remorse for such distress I feel,
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>I am a tigress, and my breast is steel.
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>Why do I scruple then to see him slain,
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>And with the tragick scene my eyes prophane?
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>My magick's art employ, not to asswage
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>The Salvages, but to enflame their rage?
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>His earth-born foes to fiercer fury move,
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>And accessary to his murder prove?
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>The Gods forbid- But pray'rs are idle breath,
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>When action only can prevent his death.
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>Shall I betray my father, and the state,
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>To intercept a rambling hero's fate;
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>Who may sail off next hour, and sav'd from harms
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>By my assistance, bless another's arms?
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>Whilst I, not only of my hopes bereft,
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>But to unpity'd punishment am left.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>If he is false, let the ingrateful bleed!
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>But no such symptom in his looks I read.
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>Nature wou'd ne'er have lavish'd so much grace
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>Upon his person, if his soul were base.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>Besides, he first shall plight his faith, and swear
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>By all the Gods; what therefore can'st thou fear?
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>Medea haste, from danger set him free,
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>Jason shall thy eternal debtor be.
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>And thou, his queen, with sov'raign state enstall'd,
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>By Graecian dames the Kind Preserver call'd.
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>Hence idle dreams, by love-sick fancy bred!
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>Wilt thou, Medea, by vain wishes led,
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>To sister, brother, father bid adieu?
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>Forsake thy country's Gods, and country too?
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>My father's harsh, my brother but a child,
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>My sister rivals me, my country's wild;
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>And for its Gods, the greatest of 'em all
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>Inspires my breast, and I obey his call.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>That great endearments I forsake, is true,
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>But greater far the hopes that I pursue:
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>The pride of having sav'd the youths of Greece
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>(Each life more precious than our golden fleece);
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>A nobler soil by me shall be possest,
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>I shall see towns with arts and manners blest;
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>And, what I prize above the world beside,
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>Enjoy my Jason- and when once his bride,
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>Be more than mortal, and to Gods ally'd.
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>They talk of hazards I must first sustain,
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>Of floating islands justling in the main;
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>Our tender barque expos'd to dreadful shocks
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>Of fierce Charybdis' gulf, and Scylla's rocks,
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>Where breaking waves in whirling eddies rowl,
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>And rav'nous dogs that in deep caverns howl:
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>Amidst these terrors, while I lye possest
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>Of him I love, and lean on Jason's breast,
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>In tempests unconcern'd I will appear,
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>Or, only for my husband's safety fear.
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>Didst thou say husband?- canst thou so deceive
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>Thy self, fond maid, and thy own cheat believe?
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>In vain thou striv'st to varnish o'er thy shame,
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>And grace thy guilt with wedlock's sacred name.
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>Pull off the coz'ning masque, and oh! in time
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>Discover and avoid the fatal crime.
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>She ceas'd- the Graces now, with kind surprize,
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>And virtue's lovely train, before her eyes
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>Present themselves, and vanquish'd Cupid flies.
<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR>She then retires to Hecate's shrine, that stood
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>Far in the covert of a shady wood:
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>She finds the fury of her flames asswag'd,
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>But, seeing Jason there, again they rag'd.
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>Blushes, and paleness did by turns invade
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>Her tender cheeks, and secret grief betray'd.
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>As fire, that sleeping under ashes lyes,
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>Fresh-blown, and rous'd, does up in blazes rise,
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>So flam'd the virgin's breast-
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>New kindled by her lover's sparkling eyes.
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>For chance, that day, had with uncommon grace
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>Adorn'd the lovely youth, and through his face
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>Display'd an air so pleasing as might charm
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>A Goddess, and a Vestal's bosom warm.
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>Her ravish'd eyes survey him o'er and o'er,
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>As some gay wonder never seen before;
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>Transported to the skies she seems to be,
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>And thinks she gazes on a deity.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>But when he spoke, and prest her trembling hand,
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>And did with tender words her aid demand,
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>With vows, and oaths to make her soon his bride,
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>She wept a flood of tears, and thus reply'd:
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>I see my error, yet to ruin move,
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>Nor owe my fate to ignorance, but love:
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>Your life I'll guard, and only crave of you
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>To swear once more- and to your oath be true.
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>He swears by Hecate he would all fulfil,
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>And by her grandfather's prophetick skill,
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>By ev'ry thing that doubting love cou'd press,
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>His present danger, and desir'd success.
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>She credits him, and kindly does produce
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>Enchanted herbs, and teaches him their use:
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>Their mystick names, and virtues he admires,
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>And with his booty joyfully retires.
<A NAME="153"></A><BR><BR><B>The Dragon's Teeth transform'd to Men</B>
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR>Impatient for the wonders of the day,
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>Aurora drives the loyt'ring stars away.
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>Now Mars's mount the pressing people fill,
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>The crowd below, the nobles crown the hill;
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>The king himself high-thron'd above the rest,
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>With iv'ry scepter, and in purple drest.
<A NAME="160"></A><BR><BR>Forthwith the brass-hoof'd bulls are set at 
<A NAME="161"></A>large,
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>Whose furious nostrils sulph'rous flame discharge:
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>The blasted herbage by their breath expires;
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>As forges rumble with excessive fires,
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>And furnaces with fiercer fury glow,
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>When water on the panting mass ye throw;
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>With such a noise, from their convulsive breast,
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>Thro' bellowing throats, the struggling vapour prest.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>Yet Jason marches up without concern,
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>While on th' advent'rous youth the monsters turn
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>Their glaring eyes, and, eager to engage,
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>Brandish their steel-tipt horns in threatning rage:
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>With brazen hoofs they beat the ground, and choak
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>The ambient air with clouds of dust and smoak:
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>Each gazing Graecian for his champion shakes,
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>While bold advances he securely makes
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>Thro' sindging blasts; such wonders magick art
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>Can work, when love conspires, and plays his part.
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>The passive savages like statues stand,
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>While he their dew-laps stroaks with soothing hand;
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>To unknown yokes their brawny necks they yield,
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>And, like tame oxen, plow the wond'ring field.
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>The Colchians stare; the Graecians shout, and raise
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>Their champion's courage with inspiring praise.
<A NAME="185"></A><BR><BR>Embolden'd now, on fresh attempts he goes,
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>With serpent's teeth the fertile furrows sows;
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>The glebe, fermenting with inchanted juice,
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>Makes the snake's teeth a human crop produce.
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>For as an infant, pris'ner to the womb,
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>Contented sleeps, 'till to perfection come,
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>Then does the cell's obscure confinement scorn,
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>He tosses, throbs, and presses to be born;
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>So from the lab'ring Earth no single birth,
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>But a whole troop of lusty youths rush forth;
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>And, what's more strange, with martial fury warm'd,
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>And for encounter all compleatly arm'd;
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>In rank and file, as they were sow'd, they stand,
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>Impatient for the signal of command.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>No foe but the Aemonian youth appears;
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>At him they level their steel-pointed spears;
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>His frighted friends, who triumph'd, just before,
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>With peals of sighs his desp'rate case deplore:
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>And where such hardy warriors are afraid,
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>What must the tender, and enamour'd maid?
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>Her spirits sink, the blood her cheek forsook;
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>She fears, who for his safety undertook:
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>She knew the vertue of the spells she gave,
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>She knew the force, and knew her lover brave;
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>But what's a single champion to an host?
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>Yet scorning thus to see him tamely lost,
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>Her strong reserve of secret arts she brings,
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>And last, her never-failing song she sings.
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>Wonders ensue; among his gazing foes
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>The massy fragment of a rock he throws;
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>This charm in civil war engag'd 'em all;
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>By mutual wounds those Earth-born brothers fall.
<A NAME="217"></A><BR><BR>The Greeks, transported with the strange success,
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>Leap from their seats the conqu'ror to caress;
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>Commend, and kiss, and clasp him in their arms:
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>So would the kind contriver of the charms;
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>But her, who felt the tenderest concern,
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>Honour condemns in secret flames to burn;
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>Committed to a double guard of fame,
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>Aw'd by a virgin's, and a princess' name.
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>But thoughts are free, and fancy unconfin'd,
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>She kisses, courts, and hugs him in her mind;
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>To fav'ring Pow'rs her silent thanks she gives,
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>By whose indulgence her lov'd hero lives.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR><BR>One labour more remains, and, tho' the last,
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>In danger far surmounting all the past;
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>That enterprize by Fates in store was kept,
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>To make the dragon sleep that never slept,
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>Whose crest shoots dreadful lustre; from his jaws
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>A tripple tire of forked stings he draws,
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>With fangs, and wings of a prodigious size:
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>Such was the guardian of the golden prize.
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>Yet him, besprinkled with Lethaean dew,
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>The fair inchantress into slumber threw;
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>And then, to fix him, thrice she did repeat
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>The rhyme, that makes the raging winds retreat,
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>In stormy seas can halcyon seasons make,
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>Turn rapid streams into a standing lake;
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>While the soft guest his drowzy eye-lids seals,
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>Th' ungarded golden fleece the stranger steals;
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>Proud to possess the purchase of his toil,
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>Proud of his royal bride, the richer spoil;
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>To sea both prize, and patroness he bore,
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>And lands triumphant on his native shore.
<A NAME="249"></A><BR><BR><B>Old Aeson restor'd to Youth</B>
<A NAME="250"></A><BR><BR>Aemonian matrons, who their absence mourn'd,
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>Rejoyce to see their prosp'rous sons return'd:
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>Rich curling fumes of incense feast the skies,
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>An hecatomb of voted victims dies,
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>With gilded horns, and garlands on their head,
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>And all the pomp of death, to th' altar led.
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>Congratulating bowls go briskly round,
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>Triumphant shouts in louder musick drown'd.
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>Amidst these revels, why that cloud of care
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>On Jason's brow? (to whom the largest share
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>Of mirth was due)- His father was not there.
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>Aeson was absent, once the young, and brave,
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>Now crush'd with years, and bending to the grave.
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>At last withdrawn, and by the crowd unseen,
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>Pressing her hand (with starting sighs between),
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>He supplicates his kind, and skilful queen.
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR>O patroness! preserver of my life!
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>(Dear when my mistress, and much dearer wife)
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>Your favours to so vast a sum amount,
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>'Tis past the pow'r of numbers to recount;
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>Or cou'd they be to computation brought,
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>The history would a romance be thought:
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>And yet, unless you add one favour more,
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>Greater than all that you conferr'd before,
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>But not too hard for love and magick skill,
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>Your past are thrown away, and Jason's wretched 
<A NAME="276"></A>still.
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>The morning of my life is just begun,
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>But my declining father's race is run;
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>From my large stock retrench the long arrears,
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>And add 'em to expiring Aeson's years.
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR>Thus spake the gen'rous youth, and wept the 
<A NAME="282"></A>rest.
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>Mov'd with the piety of his request,
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>To his ag'd sire such filial duty shown,
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>So diff'rent from her treatment of her own,
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>But still endeav'ring her remorse to hide,
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>She check'd her rising sighs, and thus reply'd.
<A NAME="288"></A><BR><BR>How cou'd the thought of such inhuman wrong
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>Escape (said she) from pious Jason's tongue?
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>Does the whole world another Jason bear,
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>Whose life Medea can to yours prefer?
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>Or cou'd I with so dire a change dispence,
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>Hecate will never join in that offence:
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>Unjust is the request you make, and I
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>In kindness your petition shall deny;
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>Yet she that grants not what you do implore,
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>Shall yet essay to give her Jason more;
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>Find means t' encrease the stock of Aeson's years,
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>Without retrenchment of your life's arrears;
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>Provided that the triple Goddess join
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>A strong confed'rate in my bold design.
<A NAME="302"></A><BR><BR>Thus was her enterprize resolv'd; but still
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>Three tedious nights are wanting to fulfil
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>The circling crescents of th' encreasing moon;
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>Then, in the height of her nocturnal noon,
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>Medea steals from court; her ankles bare,
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>Her garments closely girt, but loose her hair;
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>Thus sally'd, like a solitary sprite,
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>She traverses the terrors of the night.
<A NAME="310"></A><BR><BR>Men, beasts, and birds in soft repose lay charm'd,
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>No boistrous wind the mountain-woods alarm'd;
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>Nor did those walks of love, the myrtle-trees,
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>Of am'rous Zephir hear the whisp'ring breeze;
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>All elements chain'd in unactive rest,
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>No sense but what the twinkling stars exprest;
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>To them (that only wak'd) she rears her arm,
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>And thus commences her mysterious charms.
<A NAME="318"></A><BR><BR>She turn'd her thrice about, as oft she threw
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>On her pale tresses the nocturnal dew;
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>Then yelling thrice a most enormous sound,
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>Her bare knee bended on the flinty ground.
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>O night (said she) thou confident and guide
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>Of secrets, such as darkness ought to hide;
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>Ye stars and moon, that, when the sun retires,
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>Support his empire with succeeding fires;
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>And thou, great Hecate, friend to my design;
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>Songs, mutt'ring spells, your magick forces join;
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>And thou, O Earth, the magazine that yields
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>The midnight sorcerer drugs; skies, mountains, fields;
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>Ye wat'ry Pow'rs of fountain, stream, and lake;
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>Ye sylvan Gods, and Gods of night, awake,
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>And gen'rously your parts in my adventure take.
<A NAME="333"></A><BR><BR>Oft by your aid swift currents I have led
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>Thro' wand'ring banks, back to their fountain head;
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>Transformed the prospect of the briny deep,
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>Made sleeping billows rave, and raving billows sleep;
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>Made clouds, or sunshine; tempests rise, or fall;
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>And stubborn lawless winds obey my call:
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>With mutter'd words disarm'd the viper's jaw;
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>Up by the roots vast oaks, and rocks cou'd draw,
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>Make forests dance, and trembling mountains come,
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>Like malefactors, to receive their doom;
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>Earth groan, and frighted ghosts forsake their tomb.
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>Thee, Cynthia, my resistless rhymes drew down,
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>When tinkling cymbals strove my voice to drown;
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>Nor stronger Titan could their force sustain,
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>In full career compell'd to stop his wain:
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>Nor could Aurora's virgin blush avail,
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>With pois'nous herbs I turn'd her roses pale;
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>The fury of the fiery bulls I broke,
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>Their stubborn necks submitting to my yoke;
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>And when the sons of Earth with fury burn'd,
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>Their hostile rage upon themselves I turn'd;
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>The brothers made with mutual wounds to bleed,
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>And by their fatal strife my lover freed;
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>And, while the dragon slept, to distant Greece,
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>Thro' cheated guards, convey'd the golden fleece.
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>But now to bolder action I proceed,
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>Of such prevailing juices now have need,
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>That wither'd years back to their bloom can bring,
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>And in dead winter raise a second spring.
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>And you'll perform't-
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>You will; for lo! the stars, with sparkling fires,
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>Presage as bright success to my desires:
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>And now another happy omen see!
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>A chariot drawn by dragons waits for me.
<A NAME="367"></A><BR><BR>With these last words he leaps into the wain,
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>Stroaks the snakes' necks, and shakes the golden 
<A NAME="369"></A>rein;
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>That signal giv'n, they mount her to the skies,
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>And now beneath her fruitful Tempe lies,
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>Whose stories she ransacks, then to Crete she flies;
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>There Ossa, Pelion, Othrys, Pindus, all
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>To the fair ravisher, a booty fall;
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>The tribute of their verdure she collects,
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>Nor proud Olympus' height his plants protects.
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>Some by the roots she plucks; the tender tops
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>Of others with her culling sickle crops.
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>Nor could the plunder of the hills suffice,
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>Down to the humble vales, and meads she flies;
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>Apidanus, Amphrysus, the next rape
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>Sustain, nor could Enipeus' bank escape;
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>Thro' Beebe's marsh, and thro' the border rang'd
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>Whose pasture Glaucus to a Triton chang'd.
<A NAME="385"></A><BR><BR>Now the ninth day, and ninth successive night,
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>Had wonder'd at the restless rover's flight;
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>Mean-while her dragons, fed with no repast,
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>But her exhaling simples od'rous blast,
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>Their tarnish'd scales, and wrinkled skins had cast.
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>At last return'd before her palace gate,
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>Quitting her chariot, on the ground she sate;
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>The sky her only canopy of state.
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>All conversation with her sex she fled,
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>Shun'd the caresses of the nuptial bed:
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>Two altars next of grassy turf she rears,
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>This Hecate's name, that Youth's inscription bears;
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>With forest-boughs, and vervain these she crown'd;
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>Then delves a double trench in lower ground,
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>And sticks a black-fleec'd ram, that ready stood,
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>And drench'd the ditches with devoted blood:
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>New wine she pours, and milk from th' udder warm,
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>With mystick murmurs to compleat the charm,
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>And subterranean deities alarm.
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>To the stern king of ghosts she next apply'd,
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>And gentle Proserpine, his ravish'd bride,
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>That for old Aeson with the laws of Fate
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>They would dispense, and lengthen his short date;
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>Thus with repeated pray'rs she long assails
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>Th' infernal tyrant and at last prevails;
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>Then calls to have decrepit Aeson brought,
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>And stupifies him with a sleeping draught;
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>On Earth his body, like a corpse, extends,
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>Then charges Jason and his waiting friends
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>To quit the place, that no unhallow'd eye
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>Into her art's forbidden secrets pry.
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>This done, th' inchantress, with her locks unbound,
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>About her altars trips a frantick round;
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>Piece-meal the consecrated wood she splits,
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>And dips the splinters in the bloody pits,
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>Then hurles 'em on the piles; the sleeping sire
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>She lustrates thrice, with sulphur, water, fire.
<A NAME="422"></A><BR><BR>In a large cauldron now the med'cine boils,
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>Compounded of her late-collected spoils,
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>Blending into the mesh the various pow'rs
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>Of wonder-working juices, roots, and flow'rs;
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>With gems i' th' eastern ocean's cell refin'd,
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>And such as ebbing tides had left behind;
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>To them the midnight's pearly dew she flings,
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>A scretch-owl's carcase, and ill boding wings;
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>Nor could the wizard wolf's warm entrails scape
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>(That wolf who counterfeits a human shape).
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>Then, from the bottom of her conj'ring bag,
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>Snakes' skins, and liver of a long-liv'd stag;
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>Last a crow's head to such an age arriv'd,
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>That he had now nine centuries surviv'd;
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>These, and with these a thousand more that grew
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>In sundry soils, into her pot she threw;
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>Then with a wither'd olive-bough she rakes
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>The bubling broth; the bough fresh verdure takes;
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>Green leaves at first the perish'd plant surround,
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>Which the next minute with ripe fruit were crown'd.
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>The foaming juices now the brink o'er-swell;
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>The barren heath, where-e'er the liquor fell,
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>Sprang out with vernal grass, and all the pride
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>Of blooming May- When this Medea spy'd,
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>She cuts her patient's throat; th' exhausted blood
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>Recruiting with her new enchanted flood;
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>While at his mouth, and thro' his op'ning wound,
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>A double inlet her infusion found;
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>His feeble frame resumes a youthful air,
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>A glossy brown his hoary beard and hair.
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>The meager paleness from his aspect fled,
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>And in its room sprang up a florid red;
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>Thro' all his limbs a youthful vigour flies,
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>His empty'd art'ries swell with fresh supplies:
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>Gazing spectators scarce believe their eyes.
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>But Aeson is the most surpriz'd to find
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>A happy change in body and in mind;
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>In sense and constitution the same man,
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>As when his fortieth active year began.
<A NAME="461"></A><BR><BR>Bacchus, who from the clouds this wonder view'd,
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>Medea's method instantly pursu'd,
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>And his indulgent nurse's youth renew'd.
<A NAME="464"></A><BR><BR><B>The Death of Pelias</B>
<A NAME="465"></A><BR><BR>Thus far obliging love employ'd her art,
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>But now revenge must act a tragick part;
<A NAME="467"></A><BR><BR>Medea feigns a mortal quarrel bred
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>Betwixt her, and the partner of her bed;
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>On this pretence to Pelias' court she flies,
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>Who languishing with age and sickness lies:
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>His guiltless daughters, with inveigling wiles,
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>And well dissembled friendship, she beguiles:
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>The strange achievements of her art she tells,
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>With Aeson's cure, and long on that she dwells,
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>'Till them to firm perswasion she has won,
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>The same for their old father may be done:
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>For him they court her to employ her skill,
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>And put upon the cure what price she will.
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>At first she's mute, and with a grave pretence
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>Of difficulty, holds 'em in suspense;
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>Then promises, and bids 'em, from the fold
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>Chuse out a ram, the most infirm and old;
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>That so by fact their doubts may be remov'd,
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>And first on him the operation prov'd.
<A NAME="485"></A><BR><BR>A wreath-horn'd ram is brought, so far o'er-grown
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>With years, his age was to that age unknown
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>Of sense too dull the piercing point to feel,
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>And scarce sufficient blood to stain the steel.
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>His carcass she into a cauldron threw,
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>With drugs whose vital qualities she knew;
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>His limbs grow less, he casts his horns, and years,
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>And tender bleatings strike their wond'ring ears.
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>Then instantly leaps forth a frisking lamb,
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>That seeks (too young to graze) a suckling dam.
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>The sisters, thus confirm'd with the success,
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>Her promise with renew'd entreaty press;
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>To countenance the cheat, three nights and days
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>Before experiment th' inchantress stays;
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>Then into limpid water, from the springs,
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>Weeds, and ingredients of no force she flings;
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>With antique ceremonies for pretence
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>And rambling rhymes without a word of sense.
<A NAME="503"></A><BR><BR>Mean-while the king with all his guards lay 
<A NAME="504"></A>bound
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>In magick sleep, scarce that of death so sound;
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>The daughters now are by the sorc'ress led
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>Into his chamber, and surround his bed.
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>Your father's health's concern'd, and can ye stay?
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>Unnat'ral nymphs, why this unkind delay?
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>Unsheath your swords, dismiss his lifeless blood,
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>And I'll recruit it with a vital flood:
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>Your father's life and health is in your hand,
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>And can ye thus like idle gazers stand?
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>Unless you are of common sense bereft,
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>If yet one spark of piety is left,
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>Dispatch a father's cure, and disengage
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>The monarch from his toilsome load of age:
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>Come- drench your weapons in his putrid gore;
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>'Tis charity to wound, when wounding will restore.
<A NAME="520"></A><BR><BR>Thus urg'd, the poor deluded maids proceed,
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>Betray'd by zeal, to an inhumane deed,
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>And, in compassion, make a father bleed.
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>Yes, she who had the kindest, tend'rest heart,
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>Is foremost to perform the bloody part.
<A NAME="525"></A><BR><BR>Yet, tho' to act the butchery betray'd,
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>They could not bear to see the wounds they made;
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>With looks averted, backward they advance,
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>Then strike, and stab, and leave the blows to chance.
<A NAME="529"></A><BR><BR>Waking in consternation, he essays
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>(Weltring in blood) his feeble arms to raise:
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>Environ'd with so many swords- From whence
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>This barb'rous usage? what is my offence?
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>What fatal fury, what infernal charm,
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>'Gainst a kind father does his daughters arm?
<A NAME="535"></A><BR><BR>Hearing his voice, as thunder-struck they stopt,
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>Their resolution, and their weapons dropt:
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>Medea then the mortal blow bestows,
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>And that perform'd, the tragick scene to close,
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>His corpse into the boiling cauldron throws.
<A NAME="540"></A><BR><BR>Then, dreading the revenge that must ensue,
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>High mounted on her dragon-coach she flew;
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>And in her stately progress thro' the skies,
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>Beneath her shady Pelion first she spies,
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>With Othrys, that above the clouds did rise;
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>With skilful Chiron's cave, and neighb'ring ground,
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>For old Cerambus' strange escape renown'd,
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>By nymphs deliver'd, when the world was drown'd;
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>Who him with unexpected wings supply'd,
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>When delug'd hills a safe retreat deny'd.
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>Aeolian Pitane on her left hand
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>She saw, and there the statu'd dragon stand;
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>With Ida's grove, where Bacchus, to disguise
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>His son's bold theft, and to secure the prize,
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>Made the stoln steer a stag to represent;
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>Cocytus' father's sandy monument;
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>And fields that held the murder'd sire's remains,
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>Where howling Moera frights the startled plains.
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>Euryphilus' high town, with tow'rs defac'd
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>By Hercules, and matrons more disgrac'd
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>With sprouting horns, in signal punishment,
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>From Juno, or resenting Venus sent.
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>Then Rhodes, which Phoebus did so dearly prize,
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>And Jove no less severely did chastize;
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>For he the wizard native's pois'ning sight,
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>That us'd the farmer's hopeful crops to blight,
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>In rage o'erwhelm'd with everlasting night.
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>Cartheia's ancient walls come next in view,
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>Where once the sire almost a statue grew
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>With wonder, which a strange event did move,
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>His daughter turn'd into a turtle-dove.
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>Then Hyrie's lake, and Tempe's field o'er-ran,
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>Fam'd for the boy who there became a swan;
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>For there enamour'd Phyllius, like a slave,
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>Perform'd what tasks his paramour would crave.
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>For presents he had mountain-vultures caught,
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>And from the desart a tame lion brought;
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>Then a wild bull commanded to subdue,
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>The conquer'd savage by the horns he drew;
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>But, mock'd so oft, the treatment he disdains,
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>And from the craving boy this prize detains.
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>Then thus in choler the resenting lad:
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>Won't you deliver him?- You'll wish you had:
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>Nor sooner said, but, in a peevish mood,
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>Leapt from the precipice on which he stood:
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>The standers-by were struck with fresh surprize,
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>Instead of falling, to behold him rise
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>A snowy swan, and soaring to the skies.
<A NAME="588"></A><BR><BR>But dearly the rash prank his mother cost,
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>Who ignorantly gave her son for lost;
<A NAME="590"></A><BR>For his misfortune wept, 'till she became
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>A lake, and still renown'd with Hyrie's name.
<A NAME="592"></A><BR><BR>Thence to Latona's isle, where once were seen,
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>Transform'd to birds, a monarch, and his queen.
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>Far off she saw how old Cephisus mourn'd
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>His son, into a seele by Phoebus turn'd;
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>And where, astonish'd at a stranger sight,
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>Eumelus gaz'd on his wing'd daughter's flight.
<A NAME="598"></A><BR><BR>Aetolian Pleuron she did next survey,
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>Where sons a mother's murder did essay,
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>But sudden plumes the matron bore away.
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>On her right hand, Cyllene, a fair soil,
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>Fair, 'till Menephron there the beauteous hill
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>Attempted with foul incest to defile.
<A NAME="604"></A><BR><BR>Her harness'd dragons now direct she drives
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>For Corinth, and at Corinth she arrives;
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>Where, if what old tradition tells, be true,
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>In former ages men from mushrooms grew.
<A NAME="608"></A><BR><BR>But here Medea finds her bed supply'd,
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>During her absence, by another bride;
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>And hopeless to recover her lost game,
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>She sets both bride and palace in a flame.
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>Nor could a rival's death her wrath asswage,
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>Nor stopt at Creon's family her rage,
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>She murders her own infants, in despight
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>To faithless Jason, and in Jason's sight;
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>Yet e'er his sword could reach her, up she springs,
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>Securely mounted on her dragon's wings.
<A NAME="618"></A><BR><BR><B>The Story of Aegeus</B>
<A NAME="619"></A><BR><BR>From hence to Athens she directs her flight,
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>Where Phineus, so renown'd for doing right;
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>Where Periphas, and Polyphemon's neece,
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>Soaring with sudden plumes amaz'd the towns of Greece.
<A NAME="623"></A><BR><BR>Here Aegeus so engaging she addrest,
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>That first he treats her like a royal guest;
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>Then takes the sorc'ress for his wedded wife;
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>The only blemish of his prudent life.
<A NAME="627"></A><BR><BR>Mean-while his son, from actions of renown,
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>Arrives at court, but to his sire unknown.
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>Medea, to dispatch a dang'rous heir
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>(She knew him), did a pois'nous draught prepare;
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>Drawn from a drug, was long reserv'd in store
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>For desp'rate uses, from the Scythian shore;
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>That from the Echydnaean monster's jaws
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>Deriv'd its origin, and this the cause.
<A NAME="635"></A><BR><BR>Thro' a dark cave a craggy passage lies,
<A NAME="636"></A><BR>To ours, ascending from the nether skies;
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>Thro' which, by strength of hand, Alcides drew
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>Chain'd Cerberus, who lagg'd, and restive grew,
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>With his blear'd eyes our brighter day to view.
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>Thrice he repeated his enormous yell,
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>With which he scares the ghosts, and startles Hell;
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>At last outragious (tho' compell'd to yield)
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>He sheds his foam in fury on the field,-
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>Which, with its own, and rankness of the ground,
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>Produc'd a weed, by sorcerers renown'd,
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>The strongest constitution to confound;
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>Call'd Aconite, because it can unlock
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>All bars, and force its passage thro' a rock.
<A NAME="649"></A><BR><BR>The pious father, by her wheedles won,
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>Presents this deadly potion to his son;
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>Who, with the same assurance takes the cup,
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>And to the monarch's health had drank it up,
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>But in the very instant he apply'd
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>The goblet to his lips, old Aegeus spy'd
<A NAME="655"></A><BR>The iv'ry hilted sword that grac'd his side.
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>That certain signal of his son he knew,
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>And snatcht the bowl away; the sword he drew,
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>Resolv'd, for such a son's endanger'd life,
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>To sacrifice the most perfidious wife.
<A NAME="660"></A><BR>Revenge is swift, but her more active charms
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>A whirlwind rais'd, that snatch'd her from his arms.
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>While conjur'd clouds their baffled sense surprize,
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>She vanishes from their deluded eyes,
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>And thro' the hurricane triumphant flies.
<A NAME="665"></A><BR><BR>The gen'rous king, altho' o'er-joy'd to find
<A NAME="666"></A><BR>His son was safe, yet bearing still in mind
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>The mischief by his treach'rous queen design'd;
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>The horrour of the deed, and then how near
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>The danger drew, he stands congeal'd with fear.
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>But soon that fear into devotion turns,
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>With grateful incense ev'ry altar burns;
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>Proud victims, and unconscious of their fate,
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>Stalk to the temple, there to die in state.
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>In Athens never had a day been found
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>For mirth, like that grand festival, renown'd.
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>Promiscuously the peers, and people dine,
<A NAME="677"></A><BR>Promiscuously their thankful voices join,
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>In songs of wit, sublim'd by spritely wine.
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>To list'ning spheres their joint applause they raise,
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>And thus resound their matchless Theseus' praise.
<A NAME="681"></A><BR><BR>Great Theseus! Thee the Marathonian plain
<A NAME="682"></A><BR>Admires, and wears with pride the noble stain
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>Of the dire monster's blood, by valiant Theseus 
<A NAME="684"></A>slain.
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>That now Cromyon's swains in safety sow,
<A NAME="686"></A><BR>And reap their fertile field, to thee they owe.
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>By thee th' infested Epidaurian coast
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>Was clear'd, and now can a free commerce boast.
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>The traveller his journey can pursue,
<A NAME="690"></A><BR>With pleasure the late dreadful valley view,
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>And cry, Here Theseus the grand robber slew.
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>Cephysus' cries to his rescu'd shore,
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>The merciless Procrustes is no more.
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>In peace, Eleusis, Ceres' rites renew,
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>Since Theseus' sword the fierce Cercyon slew.
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>By him the tort'rer Sinis was destroy'd,
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>Of strength (but strength to barb'rous use employ'd)
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>That tops of tallest pines to Earth could bend,
<A NAME="699"></A><BR>And thus in pieces wretched captives rend.
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>Inhuman Scyron now has breath'd his last,
<A NAME="701"></A><BR>And now Alcatho's roads securely past;
<A NAME="702"></A><BR>By Theseus slain, and thrown into the deep:
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>But Earth nor Sea his scatter'd bones wou'd keep,
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>Which, after floating long, a rock became,
<A NAME="705"></A><BR>Still infamous with Scyron's hated name.
<A NAME="706"></A><BR>When Fame to count thy acts and years proceeds,
<A NAME="707"></A><BR>Thy years appear but cyphers to thy deeds.
<A NAME="708"></A><BR>For thee, brave youth, as for our common-wealth,
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>We pray; and drink, in yours, the publick health.
<A NAME="710"></A><BR>Your praise the senate, and plebeians sing,
<A NAME="711"></A><BR>With your lov'd name the court, and cottage ring.
<A NAME="712"></A><BR>You make our shepherds and our sailors glad,
<A NAME="713"></A><BR>And not a house in this vast city's sad.
<A NAME="714"></A><BR><BR>But mortal bliss will never come sincere,
<A NAME="715"></A><BR>Pleasure may lead, but grief brings up the rear;
<A NAME="716"></A><BR>While for his sons' arrival, rev'ling joy
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>Aegeus, and all his subjects does employ;
<A NAME="718"></A><BR>While they for only costly feasts prepare,
<A NAME="719"></A><BR>His neighb'ring monarch, Minos, threatens war:
<A NAME="720"></A><BR>Weak in land-forces, nor by sea more strong,
<A NAME="721"></A><BR>But pow'rful in a deep resented wrong
<A NAME="722"></A><BR>For a son's murder, arm'd with pious rage;
<A NAME="723"></A><BR>Yet prudently before he would engage,
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>To raise auxiliaries resolv'd to sail,
<A NAME="725"></A><BR>And with the pow'rful princes to prevail.
<A NAME="726"></A><BR><BR>First Anaphe, then proud Astypalaea gains,
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>By presents that, and this by threats obtains:
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>Low Mycone, Cymolus, chalky soil,
<A NAME="729"></A><BR>Tall Cythnos, Scyros, flat Seriphos' isle;
<A NAME="730"></A><BR>Paros, with marble cliffs afar display'd;
<A NAME="731"></A><BR>Impregnable Sithonia; yet betray'd
<A NAME="732"></A><BR>To a weak foe by a gold-admiring maid,
<A NAME="733"></A><BR>Who, chang'd into a daw of sable hue,
<A NAME="734"></A><BR>Still hoards up gold, and hides it from the view.
<A NAME="735"></A><BR><BR>But as these islands chearfully combine,
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>Others refuse t' embark in his design.
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>Now leftward with an easy sail he bore,
<A NAME="738"></A><BR>And prosp'rous passage to Oenopia's shore;
<A NAME="739"></A><BR>Oenopia once, but now Aegina call'd,
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>And with his royal mother's name install'd
<A NAME="741"></A><BR>By Aeacus, under whose reign did spring
<A NAME="742"></A><BR>The Myrmidons, and now their reigning king.
<A NAME="743"></A><BR><BR>Down to the port, amidst the rabble, run
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>The princes of the blood; with Telamon,
<A NAME="745"></A><BR>Peleus the next, and Phocus the third son:
<A NAME="746"></A><BR>Then Aeacus, altho' opprest with years,
<A NAME="747"></A><BR>To ask the cause of their approach appears.
<A NAME="748"></A><BR><BR>That question does the Gnossian's grief renew,
<A NAME="749"></A><BR>And sighs from his afflicted bosom drew;
<A NAME="750"></A><BR>Yet after a short solemn respite made,
<A NAME="751"></A><BR>The ruler of the hundred cities said:
<A NAME="752"></A><BR><BR>Assist our arms, rais'd for a murder'd son,
<A NAME="753"></A><BR>In this religious war no risque you'll run:
<A NAME="754"></A><BR>Revenge the dead- for who refuse to give
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>Rest to their urns, unworthy are to live.
<A NAME="756"></A><BR><BR>What you request, thus Aeacus replies,
<A NAME="757"></A><BR>Not I, but truth and common faith denies;
<A NAME="758"></A><BR>Athens and we have long been sworn allies:
<A NAME="759"></A><BR>Our leagues are fix'd, confed'rate are our pow'rs,
<A NAME="760"></A><BR>And who declare themselves their foes, are ours.
<A NAME="761"></A><BR><BR>Minos rejoins, Your league shall dearly cost
<A NAME="762"></A><BR>(Yet, mindful how much safer 'twas to boast,
<A NAME="763"></A><BR>Than there to waste his forces, and his fame,
<A NAME="764"></A><BR>Before in field with his grand foe he came),
<A NAME="765"></A><BR>Parts without blows- nor long had left the shore,
<A NAME="766"></A><BR>E're into port another navy bore,
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>With Cephalus, and all his jolly crew;
<A NAME="768"></A><BR>Th' Aeacides their old acquaintance knew:
<A NAME="769"></A><BR>The princes bid him welcome, and in state
<A NAME="770"></A><BR>Conduct the heroe to their palace gate;
<A NAME="771"></A><BR>Who entr'ring, seem'd the charming mein to wear,
<A NAME="772"></A><BR>As when in youth he paid his visit there.
<A NAME="773"></A><BR>In his right hand an olive-branch he holds,
<A NAME="774"></A><BR>And, salutation past, the chief unfolds
<A NAME="775"></A><BR>His embassy from the Athenian state,
<A NAME="776"></A><BR>Their mutual friendship, leagues of ancient date;
<A NAME="777"></A><BR>Their common danger, ev'ry thing cou'd wake
<A NAME="778"></A><BR>Concern, and his address successful make:
<A NAME="779"></A><BR>Strength'ning his plea with all the charms of sense,
<A NAME="780"></A><BR>And those, with all the charms of eloquence.
<A NAME="781"></A><BR><BR>Then thus the king: Like suitors do you stand
<A NAME="782"></A><BR>For that assistance which you may command?
<A NAME="783"></A><BR>Athenians, all our listed forces use
<A NAME="784"></A><BR>(They're such as no bold service will refuse);
<A NAME="785"></A><BR>And when y' ave drawn them off, the Gods be prais'd,
<A NAME="786"></A><BR>Fresh legions can within our isle be rais'd:
<A NAME="787"></A><BR>So stock'd with people, that we can prepare
<A NAME="788"></A><BR>Both for domestick, and for distant war,
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>Ours, or our friends' insulters to chastize.
<A NAME="790"></A><BR><BR>Long may ye flourish thus, the prince replies.
<A NAME="791"></A><BR>Strange transport seiz'd me as I pass'd along,
<A NAME="792"></A><BR>To meet so many troops, and all so young,
<A NAME="793"></A><BR>As if your army did of twins consist;
<A NAME="794"></A><BR>Yet amongst them my late acquaintance miss'd:
<A NAME="795"></A><BR>Ev'n all that to your palace did resort,
<A NAME="796"></A><BR>When first you entertain'd me at your court;
<A NAME="797"></A><BR>And cannot guess the cause from whence cou'd spring
<A NAME="798"></A><BR>So vast a change- Then thus the sighing king:
<A NAME="799"></A><BR><BR>Illustrious guest, to my strange tale attend,
<A NAME="800"></A><BR>Of sad beginning, but a joyful end:
<A NAME="801"></A><BR>The whole to a vast history wou'd swell,
<A NAME="802"></A><BR>I shall but half, and that confus'dly, tell.
<A NAME="803"></A><BR>That race whom so deserv'dly you admir'd,
<A NAME="804"></A><BR>Are all into their silent tombs retir'd:
<A NAME="805"></A><BR>They fell; and falling, how they shook my state,
<A NAME="806"></A><BR>Thought may conceive, but words can ne'er relate.
<A NAME="807"></A><BR><BR><B>The Story of Ants chang'd to Men</B>
<A NAME="808"></A><BR><BR>A dreadful plague from angry Juno came,
<A NAME="809"></A><BR>To scourge the land, that bore her rival's name;
<A NAME="810"></A><BR>Before her fatal anger was reveal'd,
<A NAME="811"></A><BR>And teeming malice lay as yet conceal'd,
<A NAME="812"></A><BR>All remedies we try, all med'cines use,
<A NAME="813"></A><BR>Which Nature cou'd supply, or art produce;
<A NAME="814"></A><BR>Th' unconquer'd foe derides the vain design,
<A NAME="815"></A><BR>And art, and Nature foil'd, declare the cause divine.
<A NAME="816"></A><BR><BR>At first we only felt th' oppressive weight
<A NAME="817"></A><BR>Of gloomy clouds, then teeming with our fate,
<A NAME="818"></A><BR>And lab'ring to discarge unactive heat:
<A NAME="819"></A><BR>But ere four moons alternate changes knew,
<A NAME="820"></A><BR>With deadly blasts the fatal South-wind blew,
<A NAME="821"></A><BR>Infected all the air, and poison'd as it flew.
<A NAME="822"></A><BR>Our fountains too a dire infection yield,
<A NAME="823"></A><BR>For crowds of vipers creep along the field,
<A NAME="824"></A><BR>And with polluted gore, and baneful steams,
<A NAME="825"></A><BR>Taint all the lakes, and venom all the streams.
<A NAME="826"></A><BR><BR>The young disease with milder force began,
<A NAME="827"></A><BR>And rag'd on birds, and beasts, excusing Man.
<A NAME="828"></A><BR>The lab'ring oxen fall before the plow,
<A NAME="829"></A><BR>Th' unhappy plow-men stare, and wonder how:
<A NAME="830"></A><BR>The tabid sheep, with sickly bleatings, pines;
<A NAME="831"></A><BR>Its wool decreasing, as its strength declines:
<A NAME="832"></A><BR>The warlike steed, by inward foes compell'd,
<A NAME="833"></A><BR>Neglects his honours, and deserts the field;
<A NAME="834"></A><BR>Unnerv'd, and languid, seeks a base retreat,
<A NAME="835"></A><BR>And at the manger groans, but wish'd a nobler fate:
<A NAME="836"></A><BR>The stags forget their speed, the boars their rage,
<A NAME="837"></A><BR>Nor can the bears the stronger herds engage:
<A NAME="838"></A><BR>A gen'ral faintness does invade 'em all,
<A NAME="839"></A><BR>And in the woods, and fields, promiscuously they 
<A NAME="840"></A>fall.
<A NAME="841"></A><BR>The air receives the stench, and (strange to say)
<A NAME="842"></A><BR>The rav'nous birds and beasts avoid the prey:
<A NAME="843"></A><BR>Th' offensive bodies rot upon the ground,
<A NAME="844"></A><BR>And spread the dire contagion all around.
<A NAME="845"></A><BR><BR>But now the plague, grown to a larger size,
<A NAME="846"></A><BR>Riots on Man, and scorns a meaner prize.
<A NAME="847"></A><BR>Intestine heats begin the civil war,
<A NAME="848"></A><BR>And flushings first the latent flame declare,
<A NAME="849"></A><BR>And breath inspir'd, which seem'd like fiery air.
<A NAME="850"></A><BR>Their black dry tongues are swell'd, and scarce can 
<A NAME="851"></A>move,
<A NAME="852"></A><BR>And short thick sighs from panting lung are drove.
<A NAME="853"></A><BR>They gape for air, with flatt'ring hopes t' abate
<A NAME="854"></A><BR>Their raging flames, but that augments their heat.
<A NAME="855"></A><BR>No bed, no cov'ring can the wretches bear,
<A NAME="856"></A><BR>But on the ground, expos'd to open air,
<A NAME="857"></A><BR>They lye, and hope to find a pleasing coolness there.
<A NAME="858"></A><BR>The suff'ring Earth with that oppression curst,
<A NAME="859"></A><BR>Returns the heat which they imparted first.
<A NAME="860"></A><BR><BR>In vain physicians would bestow their aid,
<A NAME="861"></A><BR>Vain all their art, and useless all their trade;
<A NAME="862"></A><BR>And they, ev'n they, who fleeting life recall,
<A NAME="863"></A><BR>Feel the same Pow'rs, and undistinguish'd fall.
<A NAME="864"></A><BR>If any proves so daring to attend
<A NAME="865"></A><BR>His sick companion, or his darling friend,
<A NAME="866"></A><BR>Th' officious wretch sucks in contagious breath,
<A NAME="867"></A><BR>And with his friend does sympathize in death.
<A NAME="868"></A><BR><BR>And now the care and hopes of life are past,
<A NAME="869"></A><BR>They please their fancies, and indulge their taste;
<A NAME="870"></A><BR>At brooks and streams, regardless of their shame,
<A NAME="871"></A><BR>Each sex, promiscuous, strives to quench their flame;
<A NAME="872"></A><BR>Nor do they strive in vain to quench it there,
<A NAME="873"></A><BR>For thirst, and life at once extinguish'd are.
<A NAME="874"></A><BR>Thus in the brooks the dying bodies sink,
<A NAME="875"></A><BR>But heedless still the rash survivors drink.
<A NAME="876"></A><BR><BR>So much uneasy down the wretches hate,
<A NAME="877"></A><BR>They fly their beds, to struggle with their fate;
<A NAME="878"></A><BR>But if decaying strength forbids to rise,
<A NAME="879"></A><BR>The victim crawls and rouls, 'till on the ground he 
<A NAME="880"></A>lies.
<A NAME="881"></A><BR>Each shuns his bed, as each wou'd shun his tomb,
<A NAME="882"></A><BR>And thinks th' infection only lodg'd at home.
<A NAME="883"></A><BR><BR>Here one, with fainting steps, does slowly creep
<A NAME="884"></A><BR>O'er heaps of dead, and strait augments the heap;
<A NAME="885"></A><BR>Another, while his strength and tongue prevail'd,
<A NAME="886"></A><BR>Bewails his friend, and falls himself bewail'd:
<A NAME="887"></A><BR>This with imploring looks surveys the skies,
<A NAME="888"></A><BR>The last dear office of his closing eyes,
<A NAME="889"></A><BR>But finds the Heav'ns implacable, and dies.
<A NAME="890"></A><BR><BR>What now, ah! what employ'd my troubled mind?
<A NAME="891"></A><BR>But only hopes my subjects' fate to find.
<A NAME="892"></A><BR>What place soe'er my weeping eyes survey,
<A NAME="893"></A><BR>There in lamented heaps the vulgar lay;
<A NAME="894"></A><BR>As acorns scatter when the winds prevail,
<A NAME="895"></A><BR>Or mellow fruit from shaken branches fall.
<A NAME="896"></A><BR><BR>You see that dome which rears its front so high:
<A NAME="897"></A><BR>'Tis sacred to the monarch of the sky:
<A NAME="898"></A><BR>How many there, with unregarded tears,
<A NAME="899"></A><BR>And fruitless vows, sent up successless pray'rs?
<A NAME="900"></A><BR>There fathers for expiring sons implor'd,
<A NAME="901"></A><BR>And there the wife bewail'd her gasping lord;
<A NAME="902"></A><BR>With pious off'rings they'd appease the skies,
<A NAME="903"></A><BR>But they, ere yet th' attoning vapours rise,
<A NAME="904"></A><BR>Before the altars fall, themselves a sacrifice:
<A NAME="905"></A><BR>They fall, while yet their hands the gums contain,
<A NAME="906"></A><BR>The gums surviving, but their off'rers slain.
<A NAME="907"></A><BR><BR>The destin'd ox, with holy garlands crown'd,
<A NAME="908"></A><BR>Prevents the blow, and feels th' expected wound:
<A NAME="909"></A><BR>When I my self invok'd the Pow'rs divine,
<A NAME="910"></A><BR>To drive the fatal pest from me and mine;
<A NAME="911"></A><BR>When now the priest with hands uplifted stood,
<A NAME="912"></A><BR>Prepar'd to strike, and shed the sacred blood,
<A NAME="913"></A><BR>The Gods themselves the mortal stroke bestow,
<A NAME="914"></A><BR>The victim falls, but they impart the blow:
<A NAME="915"></A><BR>Scarce was the knife with the pale purple stain'd,
<A NAME="916"></A><BR>And no presages cou'd be then obtain'd,
<A NAME="917"></A><BR>From putrid entrails, where th' infection reign'd.
<A NAME="918"></A><BR><BR>Death stalk'd around with such resistless sway,
<A NAME="919"></A><BR>The temples of the Gods his force obey,
<A NAME="920"></A><BR>And suppliants feel his stroke, while yet they pray.
<A NAME="921"></A><BR>Go now, said he, your deities implore
<A NAME="922"></A><BR>For fruitless aid, for I defie their pow'r.
<A NAME="923"></A><BR>Then with a curst malicious joy survey'd
<A NAME="924"></A><BR>The very altars, stain'd with trophies of the dead.
<A NAME="925"></A><BR><BR>The rest grown mad, and frantick with despair,
<A NAME="926"></A><BR>Urge their own fate, and so prevent the fear.
<A NAME="927"></A><BR>Strange madness that, when Death pursu'd so fast,
<A NAME="928"></A><BR>T' anticipate the blow with impious haste.
<A NAME="929"></A><BR><BR>No decent honours to their urns are paid,
<A NAME="930"></A><BR>Nor cou'd the graves receive the num'rous dead;
<A NAME="931"></A><BR>For, or they lay unbury'd on the ground,
<A NAME="932"></A><BR>Or unadorn'd a needy fun'ral found:
<A NAME="933"></A><BR>All rev'rence past, the fainting wretches fight
<A NAME="934"></A><BR>For fun'ral piles which were another's right.
<A NAME="935"></A><BR><BR>Unmourn'd they fall: for, who surviv'd to mourn?
<A NAME="936"></A><BR>And sires, and mothers unlamented burn:
<A NAME="937"></A><BR>Parents, and sons sustain an equal fate,
<A NAME="938"></A><BR>And wand'ring ghosts their kindred shadows meet.
<A NAME="939"></A><BR>The dead a larger space of ground require,
<A NAME="940"></A><BR>Nor are the trees sufficient for the fire.
<A NAME="941"></A><BR><BR>Despairing under grief's oppressive weight,
<A NAME="942"></A><BR>And sunk by these tempestuous blasts of Fate,
<A NAME="943"></A><BR>O Jove, said I, if common fame says true,
<A NAME="944"></A><BR>If e'er Aegina gave those joys to you,
<A NAME="945"></A><BR>If e'er you lay enclos'd in her embrace,
<A NAME="946"></A><BR>Fond of her charms, and eager to possess;
<A NAME="947"></A><BR>O father, if you do not yet disclaim
<A NAME="948"></A><BR>Paternal care, nor yet disown the name;
<A NAME="949"></A><BR>Grant my petitions, and with speed restore
<A NAME="950"></A><BR>My subjects num'rous as they were before,
<A NAME="951"></A><BR>Or make me partner of the fate they bore.
<A NAME="952"></A><BR>I spoke, and glorious lightning shone around,
<A NAME="953"></A><BR>And ratling thunder gave a prosp'rous sound;
<A NAME="954"></A><BR>So let it be, and may these omens prove
<A NAME="955"></A><BR>A pledge, said I, of your returning love.
<A NAME="956"></A><BR><BR>By chance a rev'rend oak was near the place,
<A NAME="957"></A><BR>Sacred to Jove, and of Dodona's race,
<A NAME="958"></A><BR>Where frugal ants laid up their winter meat,
<A NAME="959"></A><BR>Whose little bodies bear a mighty weight:
<A NAME="960"></A><BR>We saw them march along, and hide their store,
<A NAME="961"></A><BR>And much admir'd their number, and their pow'r;
<A NAME="962"></A><BR>Admir'd at first, but after envy'd more.
<A NAME="963"></A><BR>Full of amazement, thus to Jove I pray'd,
<A NAME="964"></A><BR>O grant, since thus my subjects are decay'd,
<A NAME="965"></A><BR>As many subjects to supply the dead.
<A NAME="966"></A><BR>I pray'd, and strange convulsions mov'd the oak,
<A NAME="967"></A><BR>Which murmur'd, tho' by ambient winds unshook:
<A NAME="968"></A><BR>My trembling hands, and stiff-erected hair,
<A NAME="969"></A><BR>Exprest all tokens of uncommon fear;
<A NAME="970"></A><BR>Yet both the earth and sacred oak I kist,
<A NAME="971"></A><BR>And scarce cou'd hope, yet still I hop'd the best;
<A NAME="972"></A><BR>For wretches, whatsoe'er the Fates divine,
<A NAME="973"></A><BR>Expound all omens to their own design.
<A NAME="974"></A><BR><BR>But now 'twas night, when ev'n distraction wears
<A NAME="975"></A><BR>A pleasing look, and dreams beguile our cares,
<A NAME="976"></A><BR>Lo! the same oak appears before my eyes,
<A NAME="977"></A><BR>Nor alter'd in his shape, nor former size;
<A NAME="978"></A><BR>As many ants the num'rous branches bear,
<A NAME="979"></A><BR>The same their labour, and their frugal care;
<A NAME="980"></A><BR>The branches too a like commotion sound,
<A NAME="981"></A><BR>And shook th' industrious creatures on the ground,
<A NAME="982"></A><BR>Who, by degrees (what's scarce to be believ'd)
<A NAME="983"></A><BR>A nobler form, and larger bulk receiv'd,
<A NAME="984"></A><BR>And on the earth walk'd an unusual pace,
<A NAME="985"></A><BR>With manly strides, and an erected face-
<A NAME="986"></A><BR>Their num'rous legs, and former colour lost,
<A NAME="987"></A><BR>The insects cou'd a human figure boast.
<A NAME="988"></A><BR><BR>I wake, and waking find my cares again,
<A NAME="989"></A><BR>And to the unperforming Gods complain,
<A NAME="990"></A><BR>And call their promise, and pretences, vain.
<A NAME="991"></A><BR>Yet in my court I heard the murm'ring voice
<A NAME="992"></A><BR>Of strangers, and a mixt uncommon noise:
<A NAME="993"></A><BR>But I suspected all was still a dream,
<A NAME="994"></A><BR>'Till Telamon to my apartment came,
<A NAME="995"></A><BR>Op'ning the door with an impetuous haste,
<A NAME="996"></A><BR>O come, said he, and see your faith and hopes surpast:
<A NAME="997"></A><BR>I follow, and, confus'd with wonder, view
<A NAME="998"></A><BR>Those shapes which my presaging slumbers drew:
<A NAME="999"></A><BR>I saw, and own'd, and call'd them subjects; they
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR>Confest my pow'r, submissive to my sway.
<A NAME="1001"></A><BR>To Jove, restorer of my race decay'd,
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR>My vows were first with due oblations paid,
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR>I then divide with an impartial hand
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR>My empty city, and my ruin'd land,
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR>To give the new-born youth an equal share,
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR>And call them Myrmidons, from what they were.
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR>You saw their persons, and they still retain
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR>The thrift of ants, tho' now transform'd to men.
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR>A frugal people, and inur'd to sweat,
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR>Lab'ring to gain, and keeping what they get.
<A NAME="1011"></A><BR>These, equal both in strength and years, shall join
<A NAME="1012"></A><BR>Their willing aid, and follow your design,
<A NAME="1013"></A><BR>With the first southern gale that shall present
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR>To fill your sails, and favour your intent.
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR><BR>With such discourse they entertain the day;
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR>The ev'ning past in banquets, sport, and play:
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR>Then, having crown'd the night with sweet repose,
<A NAME="1018"></A><BR>Aurora (with the wind at east) arose.
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR>Now Pallas' sons to Cephalus resort,
<A NAME="1020"></A><BR>And Cephalus with Pallas' sons to court,
<A NAME="1021"></A><BR>To the king's levee; him sleep's silken chain,
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR>And pleasing dreams, beyond his hour detain;
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR>But then the princes of the blood, in state,
<A NAME="1024"></A><BR>Expect, and meet 'em at the palace gate.
<A NAME="1025"></A><BR><BR><B>The Story of Cephalus and Procris</B>
<A NAME="1026"></A><BR><BR>To th' inmost courts the Grecian youths were 
<A NAME="1027"></A>led,
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR>And plac'd by Phocus on a Tyrian bed;
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR>Who, soon observing Cephalus to hold
<A NAME="1030"></A><BR>A dart of unknown wood, but arm'd with gold:
<A NAME="1031"></A><BR>None better loves (said he) the huntsman's sport,
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR>Or does more often to the woods resort;
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR>Yet I that jav'lin's stem with wonder view,
<A NAME="1034"></A><BR>Too brown for box, too smooth a grain for yew.
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR>I cannot guess the tree; but never art
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR>Did form, or eyes behold so fair a dart!
<A NAME="1037"></A><BR>The guest then interrupts him- 'Twou'd produce
<A NAME="1038"></A><BR>Still greater wonder, if you knew its use.
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR>It never fails to strike the game, and then
<A NAME="1040"></A><BR>Comes bloody back into your hand again.
<A NAME="1041"></A><BR>Then Phocus each particular desires,
<A NAME="1042"></A><BR>And th' author of the wond'rous gift enquires.
<A NAME="1043"></A><BR>To which the owner thus, with weeping eyes,
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR>And sorrow for his wife's sad fate, replies,
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR>This weapon here (o prince!) can you believe
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR>This dart the cause for which so much I grieve;
<A NAME="1047"></A><BR>And shall continue to grieve on, 'till Fate
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR>Afford such wretched life no longer date.
<A NAME="1049"></A><BR>Would I this fatal gift had ne'er enjoy'd,
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR>This fatal gift my tender wife destroy'd:
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR>Procris her name, ally'd in charms and blood
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR>To fair Orythia courted by a God.
<A NAME="1053"></A><BR>Her father seal'd my hopes with rites divine,
<A NAME="1054"></A><BR>But firmer love before had made her mine.
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR>Men call'd me blest, and blest I was indeed.
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR>The second month our nuptials did succeed;
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR>When (as upon Hymettus' dewy head,
<A NAME="1058"></A><BR>For mountain stags my net betimes I spread)
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR>Aurora spy'd, and ravish'd me away,
<A NAME="1060"></A><BR>With rev'rence to the Goddess, I must say,
<A NAME="1061"></A><BR>Against my will, for Procris had my heart,
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR>Nor wou'd her image from my thoughts depart.
<A NAME="1063"></A><BR>At last, in rage she cry'd, Ingrateful boy
<A NAME="1064"></A><BR>Go to your Procris, take your fatal joy;
<A NAME="1065"></A><BR>And so dismiss'd me: musing, as I went,
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR>What those expressions of the Goddess meant,
<A NAME="1067"></A><BR>A thousand jealous fears possess me now,
<A NAME="1068"></A><BR>Lest Procris had prophan'd her nuptial vow:
<A NAME="1069"></A><BR>Her youth and charms did to my fancy paint
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR>A lewd adultress, but her life a saint.
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR>Yet I was absent long, the Goddess too
<A NAME="1072"></A><BR>Taught me how far a woman cou'd be true.
<A NAME="1073"></A><BR>Aurora's treatment much suspicion bred;
<A NAME="1074"></A><BR>Besides, who truly love, ev'n shadows dread.
<A NAME="1075"></A><BR>I strait impatient for the tryal grew,
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR>What courtship back'd with richest gifts cou'd do.
<A NAME="1077"></A><BR>Aurora's envy aided my design,
<A NAME="1078"></A><BR>And lent me features far unlike to mine.
<A NAME="1079"></A><BR>In this disguise to my own house I came,
<A NAME="1080"></A><BR>But all was chaste, no conscious sign of blame:
<A NAME="1081"></A><BR>With thousand arts I scarce admittance found,
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR>And then beheld her weeping on the ground
<A NAME="1083"></A><BR>For her lost husband; hardly I retain'd
<A NAME="1084"></A><BR>My purpose, scarce the wish'd embrace refrain'd.
<A NAME="1085"></A><BR>How charming was her grief! Then, Phocus, guess
<A NAME="1086"></A><BR>What killing beauties waited on her dress.
<A NAME="1087"></A><BR>Her constant answer, when my suit I prest,
<A NAME="1088"></A><BR>Forbear, my lord's dear image guards this breast;
<A NAME="1089"></A><BR>Where-e'er he is, whatever cause detains,
<A NAME="1090"></A><BR>Who-e'er has his, my heart unmov'd remains.
<A NAME="1091"></A><BR>What greater proofs of truth than these cou'd be?
<A NAME="1092"></A><BR>Yet I persist, and urge my destiny.
<A NAME="1093"></A><BR>At length, she found, when my own form return'd,
<A NAME="1094"></A><BR>Her jealous lover there, whose loss she mourn'd.
<A NAME="1095"></A><BR>Enrag'd with my suspicion, swift as wind,
<A NAME="1096"></A><BR>She fled at once from me and all mankind;
<A NAME="1097"></A><BR>And so became, her purpose to retain,
<A NAME="1098"></A><BR>A nymph, and huntress in Diana's train:
<A NAME="1099"></A><BR>Forsaken thus, I found my flames encrease,
<A NAME="1100"></A><BR>I own'd my folly, and I su'd for peace.
<A NAME="1101"></A><BR>It was a fault, but not of guilt, to move
<A NAME="1102"></A><BR>Such punishment, a fault of too much love.
<A NAME="1103"></A><BR>Thus I retriev'd her to my longing arms,
<A NAME="1104"></A><BR>And many happy days possess'd her charms.
<A NAME="1105"></A><BR>But with herself she kindly did confer,
<A NAME="1106"></A><BR>What gifts the Goddess had bestow'd on her;
<A NAME="1107"></A><BR>The fleetest grey-hound, with this lovely dart,
<A NAME="1108"></A><BR>And I of both have wonders to impart.
<A NAME="1109"></A><BR>Near Thebes a savage beast, of race unknown,
<A NAME="1110"></A><BR>Laid waste the field, and bore the vineyards down;
<A NAME="1111"></A><BR>The swains fled from him, and with one consent
<A NAME="1112"></A><BR>Our Grecian youth to chase the monster went;
<A NAME="1113"></A><BR>More swift than light'ning he the toils surpast,
<A NAME="1114"></A><BR>And in his course spears, men, and trees o'er-cast.
<A NAME="1115"></A><BR>We slipt our dogs, and last my Lelaps too,
<A NAME="1116"></A><BR>When none of all the mortal race wou'd do:
<A NAME="1117"></A><BR>He long before was struggling from my hands,
<A NAME="1118"></A><BR>And, e're we cou'd unloose him, broke his bands.
<A NAME="1119"></A><BR>That minute where he was, we cou'd not find,
<A NAME="1120"></A><BR>And only saw the dust he left behind.
<A NAME="1121"></A><BR>I climb'd a neighb'ring hill to view the chase,
<A NAME="1122"></A><BR>While in the plain they held an equal race;
<A NAME="1123"></A><BR>The savage now seems caught, and now by force
<A NAME="1124"></A><BR>To quit himself, nor holds the same strait course;
<A NAME="1125"></A><BR>But running counter, from the foe withdraws,
<A NAME="1126"></A><BR>And with short turning cheats his gaping jaws:
<A NAME="1127"></A><BR>Which he retrieves, and still so closely prest,
<A NAME="1128"></A><BR>You'd fear at ev'ry stretch he were possess'd;
<A NAME="1129"></A><BR>Yet for the gripe his fangs in vain prepare;
<A NAME="1130"></A><BR>The game shoots from him, and he chops the air.
<A NAME="1131"></A><BR>To cast my jav'lin then I took my stand;
<A NAME="1132"></A><BR>But as the thongs were fitting to my hand,
<A NAME="1133"></A><BR>While to the valley I o'er-look'd the wood,
<A NAME="1134"></A><BR>Before my eyes two marble statues stood;
<A NAME="1135"></A><BR>That, as pursu'd appearing at full stretch,
<A NAME="1136"></A><BR>This barking after, and at point to catch:
<A NAME="1137"></A><BR>Some God their course did with this wonder grace,
<A NAME="1138"></A><BR>That neither might be conquer'd in the chase.
<A NAME="1139"></A><BR>A sudden silence here his tongue supprest,
<A NAME="1140"></A><BR>He here stops short, and fain wou'd wave the rest.
<A NAME="1141"></A><BR><BR>The eager prince then urg'd him to impart,
<A NAME="1142"></A><BR>The Fortune that attended on the dart.
<A NAME="1143"></A><BR>First then (said he) past joys let me relate,
<A NAME="1144"></A><BR>For bliss was the foundation of my fate.
<A NAME="1145"></A><BR>No language can those happy hours express,
<A NAME="1146"></A><BR>Did from our nuptials me, and Procris bless:
<A NAME="1147"></A><BR>The kindest pair! What more cou'd Heav'n confer?
<A NAME="1148"></A><BR>For she was all to me, and I to her.
<A NAME="1149"></A><BR>Had Jove made love, great Jove had been despis'd;
<A NAME="1150"></A><BR>And I my Procris more than Venus priz'd:
<A NAME="1151"></A><BR>Thus while no other joy we did aspire,
<A NAME="1152"></A><BR>We grew at last one soul, and one desire.
<A NAME="1153"></A><BR>Forth to the woods I went at break of day
<A NAME="1154"></A><BR>(The constant practice of my youth) for prey:
<A NAME="1155"></A><BR>Nor yet for servant, horse, or dog did call,
<A NAME="1156"></A><BR>I found this single dart to serve for all.
<A NAME="1157"></A><BR>With slaughter tir'd, I sought the cooler shade,
<A NAME="1158"></A><BR>And winds that from the mountains pierc'd the glade:
<A NAME="1159"></A><BR>Come, gentle air (so was I wont to say)
<A NAME="1160"></A><BR>Come, gentle air, sweet Aura come away.
<A NAME="1161"></A><BR>This always was the burden of my song,
<A NAME="1162"></A><BR>Come 'swage my flames, sweet Aura come along.
<A NAME="1163"></A><BR>Thou always art most welcome to my breast;
<A NAME="1164"></A><BR>I faint; approach, thou dearest, kindest guest!
<A NAME="1165"></A><BR>These blandishments, and more than these, I said
<A NAME="1166"></A><BR>(By Fate to unsuspected ruin led),
<A NAME="1167"></A><BR>Thou art my joy, for thy dear sake I love
<A NAME="1168"></A><BR>Each desart hill, and solitary grove;
<A NAME="1169"></A><BR>When (faint with labour) I refreshment need,
<A NAME="1170"></A><BR>For cordials on thy fragrant breath I feed.
<A NAME="1171"></A><BR>At last a wand'ring swain in hearing came,
<A NAME="1172"></A><BR>And cheated with the sound of Aura's name,
<A NAME="1173"></A><BR>He thought I some assignation made;
<A NAME="1174"></A><BR>And to my Procris' ear the news convey'd.
<A NAME="1175"></A><BR>Great love is soonest with suspicion fir'd:
<A NAME="1176"></A><BR>She swoon'd, and with the tale almost expir'd.
<A NAME="1177"></A><BR>Ah! wretched heart! (she cry'd) ah! faithless man.
<A NAME="1178"></A><BR>And then to curse th' imagin'd nymph began:
<A NAME="1179"></A><BR>Yet oft she doubts, oft hopes she is deceiv'd,
<A NAME="1180"></A><BR>And chides herself, that ever she believ'd
<A NAME="1181"></A><BR>Her lord to such injustice cou'd proceed,
<A NAME="1182"></A><BR>'Till she her self were witness of the deed.
<A NAME="1183"></A><BR>Next morn I to the woods again repair,
<A NAME="1184"></A><BR>And, weary with the chase, invoke the air:
<A NAME="1185"></A><BR>Approach, dear Aura, and my bosom chear:
<A NAME="1186"></A><BR>At which a mournful sound did strike my ear;
<A NAME="1187"></A><BR>Yet I proceeded, 'till the thicket by,
<A NAME="1188"></A><BR>With rustling noise and motion, drew my eye:
<A NAME="1189"></A><BR>I thought some beast of prey was shelter'd there,
<A NAME="1190"></A><BR>And to the covert threw my certain spear;
<A NAME="1191"></A><BR>From whence a tender sigh my soul did wound,
<A NAME="1192"></A><BR>Ah me! it cry'd, and did like Procris sound.
<A NAME="1193"></A><BR>Procris was there, too well the voice I knew,
<A NAME="1194"></A><BR>And to the place with headlong horror flew;
<A NAME="1195"></A><BR>Where I beheld her gasping on the ground,
<A NAME="1196"></A><BR>In vain attempting from the deadly wound
<A NAME="1197"></A><BR>To draw the dart, her love's dear fatal gift!
<A NAME="1198"></A><BR>My guilty arms had scarce the strength to lift
<A NAME="1199"></A><BR>The beauteous load; my silks, and hair I tore
<A NAME="1200"></A><BR>(If possible) to stanch the pressing gore;
<A NAME="1201"></A><BR>For pity beg'd her keep her flitting breath,
<A NAME="1202"></A><BR>And not to leave me guilty of her death.
<A NAME="1203"></A><BR>While I intreat she fainted fast away,
<A NAME="1204"></A><BR>And these few words had only strength to say:
<A NAME="1205"></A><BR>By all the sacred bonds of plighted love,
<A NAME="1206"></A><BR>By all your rev'rence to the Pow'rs above,
<A NAME="1207"></A><BR>By all the truth for which you held me dear,
<A NAME="1208"></A><BR>And last by love, the cause through which I bleed,
<A NAME="1209"></A><BR>Let Aura never to my bed succeed.
<A NAME="1210"></A><BR>I then perceiv'd the error of our fate,
<A NAME="1211"></A><BR>And told it her, but found and told too late!
<A NAME="1212"></A><BR>I felt her lower to my bosom fall,
<A NAME="1213"></A><BR>And while her eyes had any sight at all,
<A NAME="1214"></A><BR>On mine she fix'd them; in her pangs still prest
<A NAME="1215"></A><BR>My hand, and sigh'd her soul into my breast;
<A NAME="1216"></A><BR>Yet, being undeceiv'd, resign'd her breath
<A NAME="1217"></A><BR>Methought more chearfully, and smil'd in death.
<A NAME="1218"></A><BR><BR>With such concern the weeping heroe told
<A NAME="1219"></A><BR>This tale, that none who heard him cou'd with-hold
<A NAME="1220"></A><BR>From melting into sympathizing tears,
<A NAME="1221"></A><BR>'Till Aeacus with his two sons appears;
<A NAME="1222"></A><BR>Whom he commits, with their new-levy'd bands,
<A NAME="1223"></A><BR>To Fortune's, and so brave a gen'ral's hands.
