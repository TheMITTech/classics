<A NAME="start"></A>
<A NAME="10"></A><B>The Story of Perseus continu'd</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>While Perseus entertain'd with this report
<A NAME="12"></A><BR>His father Cepheus, and the list'ning court,
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>Within the palace walls was heard aloud
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>The roaring noise of some unruly crowd;
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>Not like the songs which chearful friends prepare
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>For nuptial days, but sounds that threaten'd war;
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>And all the pleasures of this happy feast,
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>To tumult turn'd, in wild disorder ceas'd:
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>So, when the sea is calm, we often find
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>A storm rais'd sudden by some furious wind.
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>Chief in the riot Phineus first appear'd,
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>The rash ringleader of this boist'rous herd,
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>And brandishing his brazen-pointed lance,
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>Behold, he said, an injur'd man advance,
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>Stung with resentment for his ravish'd wife,
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>Nor shall thy wings, o Perseus, save thy life;
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>Nor Jove himself; tho' we've been often told
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>Who got thee in the form of tempting gold.
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>His lance was aim'd, when Cepheus ran, and said,
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>Hold, brother, hold; what brutal rage has made
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>Your frantick mind so black a crime conceive?
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>Are these the thanks that you to Perseus give?
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>This the reward that to his worth you pay,
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>Whose timely valour sav'd Andromeda?
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>Nor was it he, if you would reason right,
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>That forc'd her from you, but the jealous spight
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>Of envious Nereids, and Jove's high decree;
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>And that devouring monster of the sea,
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>That ready with his jaws wide gaping stood
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>To eat my child, the fairest of my blood.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>You lost her then, when she seem'd past relief,
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>And wish'd perhaps her death, to ease your grief
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>With my afflictions: not content to view
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>Andromeda in chains, unhelp'd by you,
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>Her spouse, and uncle; will you grieve that he
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>Expos'd his life the dying maid to free?
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>And shall you claim his merit? Had you thought
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>Her charms so great, you shou'd have bravely sought
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>That blessing on the rocks, where fix'd she lay:
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>But now let Perseus bear his prize away,
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>By service gain'd, by promis'd faith possess'd;
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>To him I owe it, that my age is bless'd
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>Still with a child: Nor think that I prefer
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>Perseus to thee, but to the loss of her.
<A NAME="55"></A><BR><BR>Phineus on him, and Perseus, roul'd about
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>His eyes in silent rage, and seem'd to doubt
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>Which to destroy; 'till, resolute at length,
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>He threw his spear with the redoubled strength
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>His fury gave him, and at Perseus struck;
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>But missing Perseus, in his seat it stuck.
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>Who, springing nimbly up, return'd the dart,
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>And almost plung'd it in his rival's heart;
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>But he for safety to the altar ran,
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>Unfit protection for so vile a man;
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>Yet was the stroke not vain, as Rhaetus found,
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>Who in his brow receiv'd a mortal wound;
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>Headlong he tumbled, when his skull was broke,
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>From which his friends the fatal weapon took,
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>While he lay trembling, and his gushing blood
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>In crimson streams around the table flow'd.
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>But this provok'd th' unruly rabble worse,
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>They flung their darts, and some in loud discourse
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>To death young Perseus, and the monarch doom;
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>But Cepheus left before the guilty room,
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>With grief appealing to the Gods above,
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>Who laws of hospitality approve,
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>Who faith protect, and succour injur'd right,
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>That he was guiltless of this barb'rous fight.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>Pallas her brother Perseus close attends,
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>And with her ample shield from harm defends,
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>Raising a sprightly courage in his heart:
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>But Indian Athis took the weaker part,
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>Born in the chrystal grottoes of the sea,
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>Limnate's son, a fenny nymph, and she
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>Daughter of Ganges; graceful was his mein,
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>His person lovely, and his age sixteen.
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>His habit made his native beauty more;
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>A purple mantle fring'd with gold he wore;
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>His neck well-turn'd with golden chains was grac'd,
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>His hair with myrrh perfum'd, was nicely dress'd.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>Tho' with just aim he cou'd the javelin throw,
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>Yet with more skill he drew the bending bow;
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>And now was drawing it with artful hand,
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>When Perseus snatching up a flaming brand,
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>Whirl'd sudden at his face the burning wood,
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>Crush'd his eyes in, and quench'd the fire with 
<A NAME="97"></A>blood;
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>Thro' the soft skin the splinter'd bones appear,
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>And spoil'd the face that lately was so fair.
<A NAME="100"></A><BR><BR>When Lycabas his Athis thus beheld,
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>How was his heart with friendly horror fill'd!
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>A youth so noble, to his soul so dear,
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>To see his shapeless look, his dying groans to hear!
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>He snatch'd the bow the boy was us'd to bend,
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>And cry'd, With me, false traytor, dare contend;
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>Boast not a conquest o'er a child, but try
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>Thy strength with me, who all thy pow'rs defy;
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>Nor think so mean an act a victory.
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>While yet he spoke he flung the whizzing dart,
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>Which pierc'd the plaited robe, but miss'd his heart:
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>Perseus defy'd, upon him fiercely press'd
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>With sword, unsheath'd, and plung'd it in his breast;
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>His eyes o'erwhelm'd with night, he stumbling falls,
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>And with his latest breath on Athis calls;
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>Pleas'd that so near the lovely youth he lies,
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>He sinks his head upon his friend, and dies.
<A NAME="117"></A><BR><BR>Next eager Phorbas, old Methion's son,
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>Came rushing forward with Amphimedon;
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>When the smooth pavement, slippery made with gore,
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>Trip'd up their feet, and flung 'em on the floor;
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>The sword of Perseus, who by chance was nigh,
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>Prevents their rise, and where they fall, they lye:
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>Full in his ribs Amphimedon he smote,
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>And then stuck fiery Phorbas in the throat.
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>Eurythus lifting up his ax, the blow
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>Was thus prevented by his nimble foe;
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>A golden cup he seizes, high embost,
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>And at his head the massy goblet tost:
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>It hits, and from his forehead bruis'd rebounds,
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>And blood, and brains he vomits from his wounds;
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>With his slain fellows on the floor he lies,
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>And death for ever shuts his swimming eyes.
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>Then Polydaemon fell, a Goddess-born;
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>Phlegias, and Elycen with locks unshorn
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>Next follow'd; next, the stroke of death he gave
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>To Clytus, Abanis, and Lycetus brave;
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>While o'er unnumber'd heaps of ghastly dead,
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>The Argive heroe's feet triumphant tread.
<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR>But Phineus stands aloof, and dreads to feel
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>His rival's force, and flies his pointed steel:
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>Yet threw a dart from far; by chance it lights
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>On Idas, who for neither party fights;
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>But wounded, sternly thus to Phineus said,
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>Since of a neuter thou a foe hast made,
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>This I return thee, drawing from his side
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>The dart; which, as he strove to fling, he dy'd.
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>Odites fell by Clymenus's sword,
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>The Cephen court had not a greater lord.
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>Hypseus his blade does in Protenor sheath,
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>But brave Lyncides soon reveng'd his death.
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>Here too was old Emathion, one that fear'd
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>The Gods, and in the cause of Heav'n appear'd,
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>Who only wishing the success of right,
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>And, by his age, exempted from the fight,
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>Both sides alike condemns: This impious war
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>Cease, cease, he cries; these bloody broils forbear.
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>This scarce the sage with high concern had said,
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>When Chromis at a blow struck off his head,
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>Which dropping, on the royal altar roul'd,
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>Still staring on the crowd with aspect bold;
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>And still it seem'd their horrid strife to blame,
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>In life and death, his pious zeal the same;
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>While clinging to the horns, the trunk expires,
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>The sever'd head consumes amidst the fires.
<A NAME="165"></A><BR><BR>Then Phineus, who from far his javelin threw,
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>Broteas and Ammon, twins and brothers, slew;
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>For knotted gauntlets matchless in the field;
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>But gauntlets must to swords and javelins yield.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>Ampycus next, with hallow'd fillets bound,
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>As Ceres' priest, and with a mitre crown'd,
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>His spear transfix'd, and struck him to the ground.
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR>O Iapetides, with pain I tell
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>How you, sweet lyrist, in the riot fell;
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>What worse than brutal rage his breast could fill,
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>Who did thy blood, o bard celestial! spill?
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>Kindly you press'd amid the princely throng,
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>To crown the feast, and give the nuptial song:
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>Discord abhorr'd the musick of thy lyre,
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>Whose notes did gentle peace so well inspire;
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>Thee, when fierce Pettalus far off espy'd,
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>Defenceless with thy harp, he scoffing cry'd,
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>Go; to the ghosts thy soothing lessons play;
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>We loath thy lyre, and scorn thy peaceful lay:
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>And, as again he fiercely bid him go,
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>He pierc'd his temples with a mortal blow.
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>His harp he held, tho' sinking on the ground,
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>Whose strings in death his trembling fingers found
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>By chance, and tun'd by chance a dying sound.
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR>With grief Lycormas saw him fall, from far,
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>And, wresting from the door a massy bar,
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>Full in his poll lays on a load of knocks,
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>Which stun him, and he falls like a devoted ox.
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>Another bar Pelates would have snach'd,
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>But Corynthus his motions slily watch'd;
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>He darts his weapon from a private stand,
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>And rivets to the post his veiny hand:
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>When strait a missive spear transfix'd his side,
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>By Abas thrown, and as he hung, he dy'd.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR>Melaneus on the prince's side was slain;
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>And Dorylas, who own'd a fertile plain,
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>Of Nasamonia's fields the wealthy lord,
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>Whose crowded barns, could scarce contain their 
<A NAME="203"></A>board.
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>A whizzing spear obliquely gave a blow,
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>Stuck in his groin, and pierc'd the nerves below;
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>His foe behld his eyes convulsive roul,
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>His ebbing veins, and his departing soul;
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>Then taunting said, Of all thy spacious plain,
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>This spot thy only property remains.
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>He left him thus; but had no sooner left,
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>Than Perseus in revenge his nostrils cleft;
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>From his friend's breast the murd'ring dart he drew,
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>And the same weapon at the murderer threw;
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>His head in halves the darted javelin cut,
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>And on each side the brain came issuing out.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR><BR>Fortune his friend, in deaths around he deals,
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>And this his lance, and that his faulchion feels:
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>Now Clytius dies; and by a diff'rent wound,
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>The twin, his brother Clanis, bites the ground.
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>In his rent jaw the bearded weapon sticks,
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>And the steel'd dart does Clytius' thigh transfix.
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>With these Mendesian Celadon he slew:
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>And Astreus next, whose mother was a Jew,
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>His sire uncertain: then by Perseus fell
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>Aethion, who cou'd things to come foretell;
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>But now he knows not whence the javelin flies
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>That wounds his breast, nor by whose arm he dies.
<A NAME="228"></A><BR><BR>The squire to Phineus next his valour try'd,
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>And fierce Agyrtes stain'd with paricide.
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR>As these are slain, fresh numbers still appear,
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>And wage with Perseus an unequal war;
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>To rob him of his right, the maid he won,
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>By honour, promise, and desert his own.
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>With him, the father of the beauteous bride,
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>The mother, and the frighted virgin side;
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>With shrieks, and doleful cries they rend the air:
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>Their shrieks confounded with the din of war,
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>With dashing arms, and groanings of the slain,
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>They grieve unpitied, and unheard complain.
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>The floor with ruddy streams Bellona stains,
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>And Phineus a new war with double rage maintains.
<A NAME="242"></A><BR><BR>Perseus begirt, from all around they pour
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>Their lances on him, a tempestuous show'r,
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>Aim'd all at him; a cloud of darts, and spears,
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>Or blind his eyes, or whistle round his ears.
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>Their numbers to resist, against the wall
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>He guards his back secure, and dares them all.
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>Here from the left Molpeus renews the fight,
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>And bold Ethemon presses on the right:
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>As when a hungry tyger near him hears
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>Two lowing herds, a-while he both forbears;
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>Nor can his hopes of this, or that renounce,
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>So strong he lusts to prey on both at once;
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>Thus Perseus now with that, or this is loth
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>To war distinct:, but fain would fall on both.
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>And first Chaonian Molpeus felt his blow,
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>And fled, and never after fac'd his foe;
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>Then fierce Ethemon, as he turn'd his back,
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>Hurried with fury, aiming at his neck,
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>His brandish'd sword against the marble struck
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>With all his might; the brittle weapon broke,
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>And in his throat the point rebounding stuck.
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>Too slight the wound for life to issue thence,
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>And yet too great for battel, or defence;
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>His arms extended in this piteous state,
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>For mercy he wou'd sue, but sues too late;
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>Perseus has in his bosom plung'd the sword,
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>And, ere he speaks, the wound prevents the word.
<A NAME="269"></A><BR><BR>The crowds encreasing, and his friends distress'd,
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>Himself by warring multitudes oppress'd:
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>Since thus unequally you fight, 'tis time,
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>He cry'd, to punish your presumptuous crime;
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>Beware, my friends; his friends were soon prepar'd,
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>Their sight averting, high the head he rear'd,
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>And Gorgon on his foes severely star'd.
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>Vain shift! says Thescelus, with aspect bold,
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>Thee, and thy bugbear monster, I behold
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>With scorn; he lifts his arm, but ere he threw
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>The dart, the heroe to a statue grew.
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>In the same posture still the marble stands,
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>And holds the warrior's weapons in its hands.
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>Amphyx, whom yet this wonder can't alarm,
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>Heaves at Lyncides' breast his impious arm;
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>But, while thus daringly he presses on,
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>His weapon and his arm are turn'd to stone.
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>Next Nileus, he who vainly said he ow'd
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>His origin to Nile's prolifick flood;
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>Who on his shield seven silver rivers bore,
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>His birth to witness by the arms he wore;
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>Full of his sev'n-fold father, thus express'd
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>His boast to Perseus, and his pride confess'd:
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>See whence we sprung; let this thy comfort be
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>In thy sure death, that thou didst die by me.
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>While yet he spoke, the dying accents hung
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>In sounds imperfect on his marble tongue;
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>Tho' chang'd to stone, his lips he seem'd to stretch,
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>And thro' th' insensate rock wou'd force a speech.
<A NAME="298"></A><BR><BR>This Eryx saw, but seeing wou'd not own;
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>The mischief by your selves, he cries, is done,
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>'Tis your cold courage turns your hearts to stone.
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>Come, follow me; fall on the stripling boy,
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>Kill him, and you his magick arms destroy.
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>Then rushing on, his arm to strike he rear'd,
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>And marbled o'er his varied frame appear'd.
<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR>These for affronting Pallas were chastis'd,
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>And justly met the death they had despis'd.
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>But brave Aconteus, Perseus' friend, by chance
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>Look'd back, and met the Gorgon's fatal glance:
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>A statue now become, he ghastly stares,
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>And still the foe to mortal combat dares.
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>Astyages the living likeness knew,
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>On the dead stone with vengeful fury flew;
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>But impotent his rage, the jarring blade
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>No print upon the solid marble made:
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>Again, as with redoubled might he struck,
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>Himself astonish'd in the quarry stuck.
<A NAME="317"></A><BR><BR>The vulgar deaths 'twere tedious to rehearse,
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>And fates below the dignity of verse;
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>Their safety in their flight two hundred found,
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>Two hundred, by Medusa's head were ston'd.
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>Fierce Phineus now repents the wrongful fight,
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>And views his varied friends, a dreadful sight;
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>He knows their faces, for their help he sues,
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>And thinks, not hearing him, that they refuse:
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>By name he begs their succour, one by one,
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>Then doubts their life, and feels the friendly stone.
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>Struck with remorse, and conscious of his pride,
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>Convict of sin, he turn'd his eyes aside;
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>With suppliant mein to Perseus thus he prays,
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>Hence with the head, as far as winds and seas
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>Can bear thee; hence, o quit the Cephen shore,
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>And never curse us with Medusa more,
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>That horrid head, which stiffens into stone
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>Those impious men who, daring death, look on.
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>I warr'd not with thee out of hate or strife,
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>My honest cause was to defend my wife,
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>First pledg'd to me; what crime cou'd I suppose,
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>To arm my friends, and vindicate my spouse?
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>But vain, too late I see, was our design;
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>Mine was the title, but the merit thine.
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>Contending made me guilty, I confess;
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>But penitence shou'd make that guilt the less:
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>'Twas thine to conquer by Minerva's pow'r;
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>Favour'd of Heav'n, thy mercy I implore;
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>For life I sue; the rest to thee I yield;
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>In pity, from my sight remove the shield.
<A NAME="347"></A><BR><BR>He suing said; nor durst revert his eyes
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>On the grim head: and Perseus thus replies:
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>Coward, what is in me to grant, I will,
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>Nor blood, unworthy of my valour spill:
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>Fear not to perish by my vengeful sword,
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>From that secure; 'tis all the Fates afford.
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>Where I now see thee, thou shalt still be seen,
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>A lasting monument to please our queen;
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>There still shall thy betroth'd behold her spouse,
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>And find his image in her father's house.
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>This said; where Phineus turn'd to shun the shield
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>Full in his face the staring head he held;
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>As here and there he strove to turn aside,
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>The wonder wrought, the man was petrify'd:
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>All marble was his frame, his humid eyes
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>Drop'd tears, which hung upon the stone like ice.
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>In suppliant posture, with uplifted hands,
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>And fearful look, the guilty statue stands.
<A NAME="365"></A><BR><BR>Hence Perseus to his native city hies,
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>Victorious, and rewarded with his prize.
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>Conquest, o'er Praetus the usurper, won,
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>He re-instates his grandsire in the throne.
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>Praetus, his brother dispossess'd by might,
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>His realm enjoy'd, and still detain'd his right:
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>But Perseus pull'd the haughty tyrant down,
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>And to the rightful king restor'd the throne.
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>Weak was th' usurper, as his cause was wrong;
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>Where Gorgon's head appears, what arms are strong?
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>When Perseus to his host the monster held,
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>They soon were statues, and their king expell'd.
<A NAME="377"></A><BR><BR>Thence, to Seriphus with the head he sails,
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>Whose prince his story treats as idle tales:
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>Lord of a little isle, he scorns to seem
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>Too credulous, but laughs at that, and him.
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>Yet did he not so much suspect the truth,
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>As out of pride, or envy, hate the youth.
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>The Argive prince, at his contempt enrag'd,
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>To force his faith by fatal proof engag'd.
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>Friends, shut your eyes, he cries; his shield he 
<A NAME="386"></A>takes,
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>And to the king expos'd Medusa's snakes.
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>The monarch felt the pow'r he wou'd not own,
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>And stood convict of folly in the stone.
<A NAME="390"></A><BR><BR><B>Minerva's Interview with the Muses</B>
<A NAME="391"></A><BR><BR>Thus far Minerva was content to rove
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>With Perseus, offspring of her father Jove:
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>Now, hid in clouds, Seriphus she forsook;
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>And to the Theban tow'rs her journey took.
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>Cythnos and Gyaros lying to the right,
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>She pass'd unheeded in her eager flight;
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>And chusing first on Helicon to rest,
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>The virgin Muses in these words address'd:
<A NAME="399"></A><BR><BR>Me, the strange tidings of a new-found spring,
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>Ye learned sisters, to this mountain bring.
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>If all be true that Fame's wide rumours tell,
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>'Twas Pegasus discover'd first your well;
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>Whose piercing hoof gave the soft earth a blow,
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>Which broke the surface where these waters flow.
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>I saw that horse by miracle obtain
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>Life, from the blood of dire Medusa slain;
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>And now, this equal prodigy to view,
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>From distant isles to fam'd Boeotia flew.
<A NAME="409"></A><BR><BR>The Muse Urania said, Whatever cause
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>So great a Goddess to this mansion draws;
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>Our shades are happy with so bright a guest,
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>You, Queen, are welcome, and we Muses blest.
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>What Fame has publish'd of our spring is true,
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>Thanks for our spring to Pegasus are due.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>Then, with becoming courtesy, she led
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>The curious stranger to their fountain's head;
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>Who long survey'd, with wonder, and delight,
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>Their sacred water, charming to the sight;
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>Their ancient groves, dark grottos, shady bow'rs,
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>And smiling plains adorn'd with various flow'rs.
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>O happy Muses! she with rapture cry'd,
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>Who, safe from cares, on this fair hill reside;
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>Blest in your seat, and free your selves to please
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>With joys of study, and with glorious ease.
<A NAME="425"></A><BR><BR><B>The Fate of Pyreneus</B>
<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR>Then one replies: O Goddess, fit to guide
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>Our humble works, and in our choir preside,
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>Who sure wou'd wisely to these fields repair,
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>To taste our pleasures, and our labours share,
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>Were not your virtue, and superior mind
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>To higher arts, and nobler deeds inclin'd;
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>Justly you praise our works, and pleasing seat,
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>Which all might envy in this soft retreat,
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>Were we secur'd from dangers, and from harms;
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>But maids are frighten'd with the least alarms,
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>And none are safe in this licentious time;
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>Still fierce Pyreneus, and his daring crime,
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>With lasting horror strikes my feeble sight,
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>Nor is my mind recover'd from the fright.
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>With Thracian arms this bold usurper gain'd
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>Daulis, and Phocis, where he proudly reign'd:
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>It happen'd once, as thro' his lands we went,
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>For the bright temple of Parnassus bent,
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>He met us there, and in his artful mind
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>Hiding the faithless action he design'd,
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>Confer'd on us (whom, oh! too well he knew)
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>All honours that to Goddesses are due.
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>Stop, stop, ye Muses, 'tis your friend who calls,
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>The tyrant said; behold the rain that falls
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>On ev'ry side, and that ill-boding sky,
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>Whose lowring face portends more storms are nigh.
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>Pray make my house your own, and void of fear,
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>While this bad weather lasts, take shelter here.
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>Gods have made meaner places their resort,
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>And, for a cottage, left their shining court.
<A NAME="456"></A><BR><BR>Oblig'd to stop, by the united force
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>Of pouring rains, and complaisant discourse,
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>His courteous invitation we obey,
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>And in his hall resolve a-while to stay.
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>Soon it clear'd up; the clouds began to fly,
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>The driving north refin'd the show'ry sky;
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>Then to pursue our journey we began:
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>But the false traitor to his portal ran,
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>Stopt our escape, the door securely barr'd,
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>And to our honour, violence prepar'd.
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>But we, transform'd to birds, avoid his snare,
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>On pinions rising in the yielding air.
<A NAME="468"></A><BR><BR>But he, by lust and indignation fir'd,
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>Up to his highest tow'r with speed retir'd,
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>And cries, In vain you from my arms withdrew,
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>The way you go your lover will pursue.
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>Then, in a flying posture wildly plac'd,
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>And daring from that height himself to cast,
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>The wretch fell headlong, and the ground bestrew'd
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>With broken bones, and stains of guilty blood.
<A NAME="476"></A><BR><BR><B>The Story of the Pierides</B>
<A NAME="477"></A><BR><BR>The Muse yet spoke; when they began to hear
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>A noise of wings that flutter'd in the air;
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>And strait a voice, from some high-spreading bough,
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>Seem'd to salute the company below.
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>The Goddess wonder'd, and inquir'd from whence
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>That tongue was heard, that spoke so plainly sense
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>(It seem'd to her a human voice to be,
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>But prov'd a bird's; for in a shady tree
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>Nine magpies perch'd lament their alter'd state,
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>And, what they hear, are skilful to repeat).
<A NAME="487"></A><BR><BR>The sister to the wondring Goddess said,
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>These, foil'd by us, by us were thus repaid.
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>These did Evippe of Paeonia bring
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>With nine hard labour-pangs to Pella's king.
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>The foolish virgins of their number proud,
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>And puff'd with praises of the senseless crowd,
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>Thro' all Achaia, and th' Aemonian plains
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>Defy'd us thus, to match their artless strains;
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>No more, ye Thespian girls, your notes repeat,
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>Nor with false harmony the vulgar cheat;
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>In voice or skill, if you with us will vye,
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>As many we, in voice or skill will try.
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>Surrender you to us, if we excell,
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>Fam'd Aganippe, and Medusa's well.
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>The conquest yours, your prize from us shall be
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>The Aemathian plains to snowy Paeone;
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>The nymphs our judges. To dispute the field,
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>We thought a shame; but greater shame to yield.
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>On seats of living stone the sisters sit,
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>And by the rivers swear to judge aright.
<A NAME="507"></A><BR><BR><B>The Song of the Pierides</B>
<A NAME="508"></A><BR><BR>Then rises one of the presumptuous throng,
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>Steps rudely forth, and first begins the song;
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>With vain address describes the giants' wars,
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>And to the Gods their fabled acts prefers.
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>She sings, from Earth's dark womb how Typhon rose,
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>And struck with mortal fear his heav'nly foes.
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>How the Gods fled to Egypt's slimy soil,
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>And hid their heads beneath the banks of Nile:
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>How Typhon, from the conquer'd skies, pursu'd
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>Their routed godheads to the sev'n-mouth'd flood;
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>Forc'd every God, his fury to escape,
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>Some beastly form to take, or earthly shape.
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>Jove (so she sung) was chang'd into a ram,
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>From whence the horns of Libyan Ammon came.
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>Bacchus a goat, Apollo was a crow,
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>Phaebe a cat; die wife of Jove a cow,
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>Whose hue was whiter than the falling snow.
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>Mercury to a nasty Ibis turn'd,
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>The change obscene, afraid of Typhon, mourn'd;
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>While Venus from a fish protection craves,
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>And once more plunges in her native waves.
<A NAME="529"></A><BR><BR>She sung, and to her harp her voice apply'd;
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>Then us again to match her they defy'd.
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>But our poor song, perhaps, for you to hear,
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>Nor leisure serves, nor is it worth your ear.
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>That causeless doubt remove, O Muse rehearse,
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>The Goddess cry'd, your ever-grateful verse.
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>Beneath a chequer'd shade she takes her seat,
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>And bids the sister her whole song repeat.
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>The sister thus: Calliope we chose
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>For the performance. The sweet virgin rose,
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>With ivy crown'd she tunes her golden strings,
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>And to her harp this composition sings.
<A NAME="541"></A><BR><BR><B>The Song of the Muses</B>
<A NAME="542"></A><BR><BR>First Ceres taught the lab'ring hind to plow
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>The pregnant Earth, and quickning seed to sow.
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>She first for Man did wholsome food provide,
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>And with just laws the wicked world supply'd:
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>All good from her deriv'd, to her belong
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>The grateful tributes of the Muse's song.
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>Her more than worthy of our verse we deem,
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>Oh! were our verse more worthy of the theme.
<A NAME="550"></A><BR><BR>Jove on the giant fair Trinacria hurl'd,
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>And with one bolt reveng'd his starry world.
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>Beneath her burning hills Tiphaeus lies,
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>And, strugling always, strives in vain to rise.
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>Down does Pelorus his right hand suppress
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>Tow'rd Latium, on the left Pachyne weighs.
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>His legs are under Lilybaeum spread,
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>And Aetna presses hard his horrid head.
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>On his broad back he there extended lies,
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>And vomits clouds of ashes to the skies.
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>Oft lab'ring with his load, at last he tires,
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>And spews out in revenge a flood of fires.
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>Mountains he struggles to o'erwhelm, and towns;
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>Earth's inmost bowels quake, and Nature groans.
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>His terrors reach the direful king of Hell;
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>He fears his throws will to the day reveal
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>The realms of night, and fright his trembling ghosts.
<A NAME="567"></A><BR><BR>This to prevent, he quits the Stygian coasts,
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>In his black carr, by sooty horses drawn,
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>Fair Sicily he seeks, and dreads the dawn.
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>Around her plains he casts his eager eyes,
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>And ev'ry mountain to the bottom tries.
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>But when, in all the careful search, he saw
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>No cause of fear, no ill-suspected flaw;
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>Secure from harm, and wand'ring on at will,
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>Venus beheld him from her flow'ry hill:
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>When strait the dame her little Cupid prest
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>With secret rapture to her snowy breast,
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>And in these words the flutt'ring boy addrest.
<A NAME="579"></A><BR><BR>O thou, my arms, my glory, and my pow'r,
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>My son, whom men, and deathless Gods adore;
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>Bend thy sure bow, whose arrows never miss'd,
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>No longer let Hell's king thy sway resist;
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>Take him, while stragling from his dark abodes
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>He coasts the kingdoms of superior Gods.
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>If sovereign Jove, if Gods who rule the waves,
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>And Neptune, who rules them, have been thy slaves;
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>Shall Hell be free? The tyrant strike, my son,
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>Enlarge thy mother's empire, and thy own.
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>Let not our Heav'n be made the mock of Hell,
<A NAME="590"></A><BR>But Pluto to confess thy pow'r compel.
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>Our rule is slighted in our native skies,
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>See Pallas, see Diana too defies
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>Thy darts, which Ceres' daughter wou'd despise.
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>She too our empire treats with aukward scorn;
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>Such insolence no longer's to be born.
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>Revenge our slighted reign, and with thy dart
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>Transfix the virgin's to the uncle's heart.
<A NAME="598"></A><BR><BR>She said; and from his quiver strait he drew
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>A dart that surely wou'd the business do.
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>She guides his hand, she makes her touch the test,
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>And of a thousand arrows chose the best:
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>No feather better pois'd, a sharper head
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>None had, and sooner none, and surer sped.
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>He bends his bow, he draws it to his ear,
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>Thro' Pluto's heart it drives, and fixes there.
<A NAME="606"></A><BR><BR><B>The Rape of Proserpine</B>
<A NAME="607"></A><BR><BR>Near Enna's walls a spacious lake is spread,
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>Fam'd for the sweetly-singing swans it bred;
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>Pergusa is its name: and never more
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>Were heard, or sweeter on Cayster's shore.
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>Woods crown the lake; and Phoebus ne'er invades
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>The tufted fences, or offends the shades:
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>Fresh fragrant breezes fan the verdant bow'rs,
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>And the moist ground smiles with enamel'd flow'rs
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>The chearful birds their airy carols sing,
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>And the whole year is one eternal spring.
<A NAME="617"></A><BR><BR>Here, while young Proserpine, among the maids,
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>Diverts herself in these delicious shades;
<A NAME="619"></A><BR>While like a child with busy speed and care
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>She gathers lillies here, and vi'lets there;
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>While first to fill her little lap she strives,
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>Hell's grizly monarch at the shade arrives;
<A NAME="623"></A><BR>Sees her thus sporting on the flow'ry green,
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>And loves the blooming maid, as soon as seen.
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>His urgent flame impatient of delay,
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>Swift as his thought he seiz'd the beauteous prey,
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>And bore her in his sooty carr away.
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>The frighted Goddess to her mother cries,
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>But all in vain, for now far off she flies;
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>Far she behind her leaves her virgin train;
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>To them too cries, and cries to them in vain,
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>And, while with passion she repeats her call,
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>The vi'lets from her lap, and lillies fall:
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>She misses 'em, poor heart! and makes new moan;
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>Her lillies, ah! are lost, her vi'lets gone.
<A NAME="636"></A><BR><BR>O'er hills, the ravisher, and vallies speeds,
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>By name encouraging his foamy steeds;
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>He rattles o'er their necks the rusty reins,
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>And ruffles with the stroke their shaggy manes.
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>O'er lakes he whirls his flying wheels, and comes
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>To the Palici breathing sulph'rous fumes.
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>And thence to where the Bacchiads of renown
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>Between unequal havens built their town;
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>Where Arethusa, round th' imprison'd sea,
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>Extends her crooked coast to Cyane;
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>The nymph who gave the neighb'ring lake a name,
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>Of all Sicilian nymphs the first in fame,
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>She from the waves advanc'd her beauteous head,
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>The Goddess knew, and thus to Pluto said:
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>Farther thou shalt not with the virgin run;
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>Ceres unwilling, canst thou be her son?
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>The maid shou'd be by sweet perswasion won.
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>Force suits not with the softness of the fair;
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>For, if great things with small I may compare,
<A NAME="655"></A><BR>Me Anapis once lov'd; a milder course
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>He took, and won me by his words, not force.
<A NAME="657"></A><BR><BR>Then, stretching out her arms, she stopt his 
<A NAME="658"></A>way;
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>But he, impatient of the shortest stay,
<A NAME="660"></A><BR>Throws to his dreadful steeds the slacken'd rein,
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>And strikes his iron sceptre thro' the main;
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>The depths profound thro' yielding waves he cleaves,
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>And to Hell's center a free passage leaves;
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>Down sinks his chariot, and his realms of night
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>The God soon reaches with a rapid flight.
<A NAME="666"></A><BR><BR><B>Cyane dissolves to a Fountain</B>
<A NAME="667"></A><BR><BR>But still does Cyane the rape bemoan,
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>And with the Goddess' wrongs laments her own;
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>For the stoln maid, and for her injur'd spring,
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>Time to her trouble no relief can bring.
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>In her sad heart a heavy load she bears,
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>'Till the dumb sorrow turns her all to tears.
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>Her mingling waters with that fountain pass,
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>Of which she late immortal Goddess was;
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>Her varied members to a fluid melt,
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>A pliant softness in her bones is felt;
<A NAME="677"></A><BR>Her wavy locks first drop away in dew,
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>And liquid next her slender fingers grew.
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>The body's change soon seizes its extreme,
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>Her legs dissolve, and feet flow off in stream.
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>Her arms, her back, her shoulders, and her side,
<A NAME="682"></A><BR>Her swelling breasts in little currents glide,
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>A silver liquor only now remains
<A NAME="684"></A><BR>Within the channel of her purple veins;
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>Nothing to fill love's grasp; her husband chaste
<A NAME="686"></A><BR>Bathes in that bosom he before embrac'd.
<A NAME="687"></A><BR><BR><B>A Boy transform'd to an Eft</B>
<A NAME="688"></A><BR><BR>Thus, while thro' all the Earth, and all the 
<A NAME="689"></A>main,
<A NAME="690"></A><BR>Her daughter mournful Ceres sought in vain;
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>Aurora, when with dewy looks she rose,
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>Nor burnish'd Vesper found her in repose,
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>At Aetna's flaming mouth two pitchy pines
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>To light her in her search at length she tines.
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>Restless, with these, thro' frosty night she goes,
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>Nor fears the cutting winds, nor heeds the snows;
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>And, when the morning-star the day renews,
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>From east to west her absent child pursues.
<A NAME="699"></A><BR><BR>Thirsty at last by long fatigue she grows,
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>But meets no spring, no riv'let near her flows.
<A NAME="701"></A><BR>Then looking round, a lowly cottage spies,
<A NAME="702"></A><BR>Smoaking among the trees, and thither hies.
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>The Goddess knocking at the little door,
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>'Twas open'd by a woman old and poor,
<A NAME="705"></A><BR>Who, when she begg'd for water, gave her ale
<A NAME="706"></A><BR>Brew'd long, but well preserv'd from being stale.
<A NAME="707"></A><BR>The Goddess drank; a chuffy lad was by,
<A NAME="708"></A><BR>Who saw the liquor with a grutching eye,
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>And grinning cries, She's greedy more than dry.
<A NAME="710"></A><BR><BR>Ceres, offended at his foul grimace,
<A NAME="711"></A><BR>Flung what she had not drunk into his face,
<A NAME="712"></A><BR>The sprinklings speckle where they hit the skin,
<A NAME="713"></A><BR>And a long tail does from his body spin;
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>His arms are turn'd to legs, and lest his size
<A NAME="715"></A><BR>Shou'd make him mischievous, and he might rise
<A NAME="716"></A><BR>Against mankind, diminutives his frame,
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>Less than a lizzard, but in shape the same.
<A NAME="718"></A><BR>Amaz'd the dame the wondrous sight beheld,
<A NAME="719"></A><BR>And weeps, and fain wou'd touch her quondam child.
<A NAME="720"></A><BR>Yet her approach th' affrighted vermin shuns,
<A NAME="721"></A><BR>And fast into the greatest crevice runs.
<A NAME="722"></A><BR>A name they gave him, which the spots exprest,
<A NAME="723"></A><BR>That rose like stars, and varied all his breast.
<A NAME="724"></A><BR><BR>What lands, what seas the Goddess wander'd o'er,
<A NAME="725"></A><BR>Were long to tell; for there remain'd no more.
<A NAME="726"></A><BR>Searching all round, her fruitless toil she mourns,
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>And with regret to Sicily returns.
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>At length, where Cyane now flows, she came,
<A NAME="729"></A><BR>Who cou'd have told her, were she still the same
<A NAME="730"></A><BR>As when she saw her daughter sink to Hell;
<A NAME="731"></A><BR>But what she knows she wants a tongue to tell.
<A NAME="732"></A><BR>Yet this plain signal manifestly gave,
<A NAME="733"></A><BR>The virgin's girdle floating on a wave,
<A NAME="734"></A><BR>As late she dropt it from her slender waste,
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>When with her uncle thro' the deep she past.
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>Ceres the token by her grief confest,
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>And tore her golden hair, and beat her breast.
<A NAME="738"></A><BR>She knows not on what land her curse shou'd fall,
<A NAME="739"></A><BR>But, as ingrate, alike upbraids them all,
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>Unworthy of her gifts; Trinacria most,
<A NAME="741"></A><BR>Where the last steps she found of what she lost.
<A NAME="742"></A><BR>The plough for this the vengeful Goddess broke,
<A NAME="743"></A><BR>And with one death the ox, and owner struck,
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>In vain the fallow fields the peasant tills,
<A NAME="745"></A><BR>The seed, corrupted ere 'tis sown, she kills.
<A NAME="746"></A><BR>The fruitful soil, that once such harvests bore,
<A NAME="747"></A><BR>Now mocks the farmer's care, and teems no more.
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>And the rich grain which fills the furrow'd glade,
<A NAME="749"></A><BR>Rots in the seed, or shrivels in the blade;
<A NAME="750"></A><BR>Or too much sun burns up, or too much rain
<A NAME="751"></A><BR>Drowns, or black blights destroy the blasted plain;
<A NAME="752"></A><BR>Or greedy birds the new-sown seed devour,
<A NAME="753"></A><BR>Or darnel, thistles, and a crop impure
<A NAME="754"></A><BR>Of knotted grass along the acres stand,
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>And spread their thriving roots thro' all the land.
<A NAME="756"></A><BR><BR>Then from the waves soft Arethusa rears
<A NAME="757"></A><BR>Her head, and back she flings her dropping hairs.
<A NAME="758"></A><BR>O mother of the maid, whom thou so far
<A NAME="759"></A><BR>Hast sought, of whom thou canst no tidings hear;
<A NAME="760"></A><BR>O thou, she cry'd, who art to life a friend,
<A NAME="761"></A><BR>Cease here thy search, and let thy labour end.
<A NAME="762"></A><BR>Thy faithful Sicily's a guiltless clime,
<A NAME="763"></A><BR>And shou'd not suffer for another's crime;
<A NAME="764"></A><BR>She neither knew, nor cou'd prevent the deed;
<A NAME="765"></A><BR>Nor think that for my country thus I plead;
<A NAME="766"></A><BR>My country's Pisa, I'm an alien here,
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>Yet these abodes to Elis I prefer,
<A NAME="768"></A><BR>No clime to me so sweet, no place so dear.
<A NAME="769"></A><BR>These springs I Arethusa now possess,
<A NAME="770"></A><BR>And this my seat, o gracious Goddess, bless:
<A NAME="771"></A><BR>This island why I love, and why I crost
<A NAME="772"></A><BR>Such spacious seas to reach Ortygia's coast,
<A NAME="773"></A><BR>To you I shall impart, when, void of care,
<A NAME="774"></A><BR>Your heart's at ease, and you're more fit to hear;
<A NAME="775"></A><BR>When on your brow no pressing sorrow sits,
<A NAME="776"></A><BR>For gay content alone such tales admits.
<A NAME="777"></A><BR>When thro' Earth's caverns I a-while have roul'd
<A NAME="778"></A><BR>My waves, I rise, and here again behold
<A NAME="779"></A><BR>The long-lost stars; and, as I late did glide
<A NAME="780"></A><BR>Near Styx, Proserpina there I espy'd.
<A NAME="781"></A><BR>Fear still with grief might in her face be seen;
<A NAME="782"></A><BR>She still her rape laments; yet, made a queen,
<A NAME="783"></A><BR>Beneath those gloomy shades her sceptre sways,
<A NAME="784"></A><BR>And ev'n th' infernal king her will obeys.
<A NAME="785"></A><BR><BR>This heard, the Goddess like a statue stood,
<A NAME="786"></A><BR>Stupid with grief; and in that musing mood
<A NAME="787"></A><BR>Continu'd long; new cares a-while supprest
<A NAME="788"></A><BR>The reigning of her immortal breast.
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>At last to Jove her daughter's sire she flies,
<A NAME="790"></A><BR>And with her chariot cuts the chrystal skies;
<A NAME="791"></A><BR>She comes in clouds, and with dishevel'd hair,
<A NAME="792"></A><BR>Standing before his throne, prefers her pray'r.
<A NAME="793"></A><BR><BR>King of the Gods, defend my blood and thine,
<A NAME="794"></A><BR>And use it not the worse for being mine.
<A NAME="795"></A><BR>If I no more am gracious in thy sight,
<A NAME="796"></A><BR>Be just, o Jove, and do thy daughter right.
<A NAME="797"></A><BR>In vain I sought her the wide world around,
<A NAME="798"></A><BR>And, when I most despair'd to find her, found.
<A NAME="799"></A><BR>But how can I the fatal finding boast,
<A NAME="800"></A><BR>By which I know she is for ever lost?
<A NAME="801"></A><BR>Without her father's aid, what other Pow'r
<A NAME="802"></A><BR>Can to my arms the ravish'd maid restore?
<A NAME="803"></A><BR>Let him restore her, I'll the crime forgive;
<A NAME="804"></A><BR>My child, tho' ravish'd, I'd with joy receive.
<A NAME="805"></A><BR>Pity, your daughter with a thief shou'd wed,
<A NAME="806"></A><BR>Tho' mine, you think, deserves no better bed.
<A NAME="807"></A><BR><BR>Jove thus replies: It equally belongs
<A NAME="808"></A><BR>To both, to guard our common pledge from wrongs.
<A NAME="809"></A><BR>But if to things we proper names apply,
<A NAME="810"></A><BR>This hardly can be call'd an injury.
<A NAME="811"></A><BR>The theft is love; nor need we blush to own
<A NAME="812"></A><BR>The thief, if I can judge, to be our son.
<A NAME="813"></A><BR>Had you of his desert no other proof,
<A NAME="814"></A><BR>To be Jove's brother is methinks enough.
<A NAME="815"></A><BR>Nor was my throne by worth superior got,
<A NAME="816"></A><BR>Heav'n fell to me, as Hell to him, by lot:
<A NAME="817"></A><BR>If you are still resolv'd her loss to mourn,
<A NAME="818"></A><BR>And nothing less will serve than her return;
<A NAME="819"></A><BR>Upon these terms she may again be yours
<A NAME="820"></A><BR>(Th' irrevocable terms of fate, not ours),
<A NAME="821"></A><BR>Of Stygian food if she did never taste,
<A NAME="822"></A><BR>Hell's bounds may then, and only then, be past.
<A NAME="823"></A><BR><BR><B>The Transformation of Ascalaphus into an 
<A NAME="824"></A>Owl</B>
<A NAME="825"></A><BR><BR>The Goddess now, resolving to succeed,
<A NAME="826"></A><BR>Down to the gloomy shades descends with speed;
<A NAME="827"></A><BR>But adverse fate had otherwise decreed.
<A NAME="828"></A><BR>For, long before, her giddy thoughtless child
<A NAME="829"></A><BR>Had broke her fast, and all her projects spoil'd.
<A NAME="830"></A><BR>As in the garden's shady walk she stray'd,
<A NAME="831"></A><BR>A fair pomegranate charm'd the simple maid,
<A NAME="832"></A><BR>Hung in her way, and tempting her to taste,
<A NAME="833"></A><BR>She pluck'd the fruit, and took a short repast.
<A NAME="834"></A><BR>Seven times, a seed at once, she eat the food;
<A NAME="835"></A><BR>The fact Ascalaphus had only view'd;
<A NAME="836"></A><BR>Whom Acheron begot in Stygian shades
<A NAME="837"></A><BR>On Orphne, fam'd among Avernal maids;
<A NAME="838"></A><BR>He saw what past, and by discov'ring all,
<A NAME="839"></A><BR>Detain'd the ravish'd nymph in cruel thrall.
<A NAME="840"></A><BR><BR>But now a queen, she with resentment heard,
<A NAME="841"></A><BR>And chang'd the vile informer to a bird.
<A NAME="842"></A><BR>In Phlegeton's black stream her hand she dips,
<A NAME="843"></A><BR>Sprinkles his head, and wets his babling lips.
<A NAME="844"></A><BR>Soon on his face, bedropt with magick dew,
<A NAME="845"></A><BR>A change appear'd, and gawdy feathers grew.
<A NAME="846"></A><BR>A crooked beak the place of nose supplies,
<A NAME="847"></A><BR>Rounder his head, and larger are his eyes.
<A NAME="848"></A><BR>His arms and body waste, but are supply'd
<A NAME="849"></A><BR>With yellow pinions flagging on each side.
<A NAME="850"></A><BR>His nails grow crooked, and are turn'd to claws,
<A NAME="851"></A><BR>And lazily along his heavy wings he draws.
<A NAME="852"></A><BR>Ill-omen'd in his form, the unlucky fowl,
<A NAME="853"></A><BR>Abhorr'd by men, and call'd a scrieching owl.
<A NAME="854"></A><BR><BR><B>The Daughters of Achelous transform'd to 
<A NAME="855"></A>Sirens</B>
<A NAME="856"></A><BR><BR>Justly this punishment was due to him,
<A NAME="857"></A><BR>And less had been too little for his crime;
<A NAME="858"></A><BR>But, o ye nymphs that from the flood descend,
<A NAME="859"></A><BR>What fault of yours the Gods cou'd so offend,
<A NAME="860"></A><BR>With wings and claws your beauteous forms to spoil,
<A NAME="861"></A><BR>Yet save your maiden face, and winning smile?
<A NAME="862"></A><BR>Were you not with her in Pergusa's bow'rs,
<A NAME="863"></A><BR>When Proserpine went forth to gather flow'rs?
<A NAME="864"></A><BR>Since Pluto in his carr the Goddess caught,
<A NAME="865"></A><BR>Have you not for her in each climate sought?
<A NAME="866"></A><BR>And when on land you long had search'd in vain,
<A NAME="867"></A><BR>You wish'd for wings to cross the pathless main;
<A NAME="868"></A><BR>That Earth and Sea might witness to your care:
<A NAME="869"></A><BR>The Gods were easy, and return'd your pray'r;
<A NAME="870"></A><BR>With golden wing o'er foamy waves you fled,
<A NAME="871"></A><BR>And to the sun your plumy glories spread.
<A NAME="872"></A><BR>But, lest the soft enchantment of your songs,
<A NAME="873"></A><BR>And the sweet musick of your flat'ring tongues
<A NAME="874"></A><BR>Shou'd quite be lost (as courteous fates ordain),
<A NAME="875"></A><BR>Your voice and virgin beauty still remain.
<A NAME="876"></A><BR><BR>Jove some amends for Ceres lost to make,
<A NAME="877"></A><BR>Yet willing Pluto shou'd the joy partake,
<A NAME="878"></A><BR>Gives 'em of Proserpine an equal share,
<A NAME="879"></A><BR>Who, claim'd by both, with both divides the year.
<A NAME="880"></A><BR>The Goddess now in either empire sways,
<A NAME="881"></A><BR>Six moons in Hell, and six with Ceres stays.
<A NAME="882"></A><BR>Her peevish temper's chang'd; that sullen mind,
<A NAME="883"></A><BR>Which made ev'n Hell uneasy, now is kind,
<A NAME="884"></A><BR>Her voice refines, her mein more sweet appears,
<A NAME="885"></A><BR>Her forehead free from frowns, her eyes from tears,
<A NAME="886"></A><BR>As when, with golden light, the conqu'ring day
<A NAME="887"></A><BR>Thro' dusky exhalations clears a way.
<A NAME="888"></A><BR>Ceres her daughter's rape no longer mourn'd,
<A NAME="889"></A><BR>But back to Arethusa's spring return'd;
<A NAME="890"></A><BR>And sitting on the margin, bid her tell
<A NAME="891"></A><BR>From whence she came, and why a sacred well.
<A NAME="892"></A><BR><BR><B>The Story of Arethusa</B>
<A NAME="893"></A><BR><BR>Still were the purling waters, and the maid
<A NAME="894"></A><BR>From the smooth surface rais'd her beauteous head,
<A NAME="895"></A><BR>Wipes off the drops that from her tresses ran,
<A NAME="896"></A><BR>And thus to tell Alpheus' loves began.
<A NAME="897"></A><BR><BR>In Elis first I breath'd the living air,
<A NAME="898"></A><BR>The chase was all my pleasure, all my care.
<A NAME="899"></A><BR>None lov'd like me the forest to explore,
<A NAME="900"></A><BR>To pitch the toils, and drive the bristled boar.
<A NAME="901"></A><BR>Of fair, tho' masculine, I had the name,
<A NAME="902"></A><BR>But gladly wou'd to that have quitted claim:
<A NAME="903"></A><BR>It less my pride than indignation rais'd,
<A NAME="904"></A><BR>To hear the beauty I neglected, prais'd;
<A NAME="905"></A><BR>Such compliments I loath'd, such charms as these
<A NAME="906"></A><BR>I scorn'd, and thought it infamy to please.
<A NAME="907"></A><BR><BR>Once, I remember, in the summer's heat,
<A NAME="908"></A><BR>Tir'd with the chase, I sought a cool retreat;
<A NAME="909"></A><BR>And, walking on, a silent current found,
<A NAME="910"></A><BR>Which gently glided o'er the grav'ly ground.
<A NAME="911"></A><BR>The chrystal water was so smooth, so clear,
<A NAME="912"></A><BR>My eye distinguish'd ev'ry pebble there.
<A NAME="913"></A><BR>So soft its motion, that I scarce perceiv'd
<A NAME="914"></A><BR>The running stream, or what I saw believ'd.
<A NAME="915"></A><BR>The hoary willow, and the poplar, made
<A NAME="916"></A><BR>Along the shelving bank a grateful shade.
<A NAME="917"></A><BR>In the cool rivulet my feet I dipt,
<A NAME="918"></A><BR>Then waded to the knee, and then I stript;
<A NAME="919"></A><BR>My robe I careless on an osier threw,
<A NAME="920"></A><BR>That near the place commodiously grew;
<A NAME="921"></A><BR>Nor long upon the border naked stood,
<A NAME="922"></A><BR>But plung'd with speed into the silver flood.
<A NAME="923"></A><BR>My arms a thousand ways I mov'd, and try'd
<A NAME="924"></A><BR>To quicken, if I cou'd, the lazy tide;
<A NAME="925"></A><BR>Where, while I play'd my swimming gambols o'er,
<A NAME="926"></A><BR>I heard a murm'ring voice, and frighted sprung to 
<A NAME="927"></A>shore.
<A NAME="928"></A><BR>Oh! whither, Arethusa, dost thou fly?
<A NAME="929"></A><BR>From the brook's bottom did Alpheus cry;
<A NAME="930"></A><BR>Again, I heard him, in a hollow tone,
<A NAME="931"></A><BR>Oh! whither, Arethusa, dost thou run?
<A NAME="932"></A><BR>Naked I flew, nor cou'd I stay to hide
<A NAME="933"></A><BR>My limbs, my robe was on the other side;
<A NAME="934"></A><BR>Alpheus follow'd fast, th' inflaming sight
<A NAME="935"></A><BR>Quicken'd his speed, and made his labour light;
<A NAME="936"></A><BR>He sees me ready for his eager arms,
<A NAME="937"></A><BR>And with a greedy glance devours my charms.
<A NAME="938"></A><BR>As trembling doves from pressing danger fly,
<A NAME="939"></A><BR>When the fierce hawk comes sousing from the sky;
<A NAME="940"></A><BR>And, as fierce hawks the trembling doves pursue,
<A NAME="941"></A><BR>From him I fled, and after me he flew.
<A NAME="942"></A><BR>First by Orchomenus I took my flight,
<A NAME="943"></A><BR>And soon had Psophis and Cyllene in sight;
<A NAME="944"></A><BR>Behind me then high Maenalus I lost,
<A NAME="945"></A><BR>And craggy Erimanthus scal'd with frost;
<A NAME="946"></A><BR>Elis was next; thus far the ground I trod
<A NAME="947"></A><BR>With nimble feet, before the distanc'd God.
<A NAME="948"></A><BR>But here I lagg'd, unable to sustain
<A NAME="949"></A><BR>The labour longer, and my flight maintain;
<A NAME="950"></A><BR>While he more strong, more patient of the toil,
<A NAME="951"></A><BR>And fir'd with hopes of beauty's speedy spoil,
<A NAME="952"></A><BR>Gain'd my lost ground, and by redoubled pace,
<A NAME="953"></A><BR>Now left between us but a narrow space.
<A NAME="954"></A><BR>Unweary'd I 'till now o'er hills, and plains,
<A NAME="955"></A><BR>O'er rocks, and rivers ran, and felt no pains:
<A NAME="956"></A><BR>The sun behind me, and the God I kept,
<A NAME="957"></A><BR>But, when I fastest shou'd have run, I stept.
<A NAME="958"></A><BR>Before my feet his shadow now appear'd;
<A NAME="959"></A><BR>As what I saw, or rather what I fear'd.
<A NAME="960"></A><BR>Yet there I could not be deceiv'd by fear,
<A NAME="961"></A><BR>Who felt his breath pant on my braided hair,
<A NAME="962"></A><BR>And heard his sounding tread, and knew him to be 
<A NAME="963"></A>near.
<A NAME="964"></A><BR>Tir'd, and despairing, O celestial maid,
<A NAME="965"></A><BR>I'm caught, I cry'd, without thy heav'nly aid.
<A NAME="966"></A><BR>Help me, Diana, help a nymph forlorn,
<A NAME="967"></A><BR>Devoted to the woods, who long has worn
<A NAME="968"></A><BR>Thy livery, and long thy quiver born.
<A NAME="969"></A><BR>The Goddess heard; my pious pray'r prevail'd;
<A NAME="970"></A><BR>In muffling clouds my virgin head was veil'd,
<A NAME="971"></A><BR>The am'rous God, deluded of his hopes,
<A NAME="972"></A><BR>Searches the gloom, and thro' the darkness gropes;
<A NAME="973"></A><BR>Twice, where Diana did her servant hide
<A NAME="974"></A><BR>He came, and twice, O Arethusa! cry'd.
<A NAME="975"></A><BR>How shaken was my soul, how sunk my heart!
<A NAME="976"></A><BR>The terror seiz'd on ev'ry trembling part.
<A NAME="977"></A><BR>Thus when the wolf about the mountain prowls
<A NAME="978"></A><BR>For prey, the lambkin hears his horrid howls:
<A NAME="979"></A><BR>The tim'rous hare, the pack approaching nigh,
<A NAME="980"></A><BR>Thus hearkens to the hounds, and trembles at the 
<A NAME="981"></A>cry;
<A NAME="982"></A><BR>Nor dares she stir, for fear her scented breath
<A NAME="983"></A><BR>Direct the dogs, and guide the threaten'd death.
<A NAME="984"></A><BR>Alpheus in the cloud no traces found
<A NAME="985"></A><BR>To mark my way, yet stays to guard the ground,
<A NAME="986"></A><BR>The God so near, a chilly sweat possest
<A NAME="987"></A><BR>My fainting limbs, at ev'ry pore exprest;
<A NAME="988"></A><BR>My strength distill'd in drops, my hair in dew,
<A NAME="989"></A><BR>My form was chang'd, and all my substance new.
<A NAME="990"></A><BR>Each motion was a stream, and my whole frame
<A NAME="991"></A><BR>Turn'd to a fount, which still preserves my name.
<A NAME="992"></A><BR>Resolv'd I shou'd not his embrace escape,
<A NAME="993"></A><BR>Again the God resumes his fluid shape;
<A NAME="994"></A><BR>To mix his streams with mine he fondly tries,
<A NAME="995"></A><BR>But still Diana his attempt denies.
<A NAME="996"></A><BR>She cleaves the ground; thro' caverns dark I run
<A NAME="997"></A><BR>A diff'rent current, while he keeps his own.
<A NAME="998"></A><BR>To dear Ortygia she conducts my way,
<A NAME="999"></A><BR>And here I first review the welcome day.
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR><BR>Here Arethusa stopt; then Ceres takes
<A NAME="1001"></A><BR>Her golden carr, and yokes her fiery snakes;
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR>With a just rein, along mid-heaven she flies
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR>O'er Earth, and seas, and cuts the yielding skies.
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR>She halts at Athens, dropping like a star,
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR>And to Triptolemus resigns her carr.
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR>Parent of seed, she gave him fruitful grain,
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR>And bad him teach to till and plough the plain;
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR>The seed to sow, as well in fallow fields,
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR>As where the soil manur'd a richer harvest yields.
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR><BR><B>The Transformation of Lyncus</B>
<A NAME="1011"></A><BR><BR>The youth o'er Europe and o'er Asia drives,
<A NAME="1012"></A><BR>'Till at the court of Lyncus he arrives.
<A NAME="1013"></A><BR>The tyrant Scythia's barb'rous empire sway'd;
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR>And, when he saw Triptolemus, he said,
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR>How cam'st thou, stranger, to our court, and why?
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR>Thy country, and thy name? The youth did thus reply:
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR>Triptolemus my name; my country's known
<A NAME="1018"></A><BR>O'er all the world, Minerva's fav'rite town,
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR>Athens, the first of cities in renown.
<A NAME="1020"></A><BR>By land I neither walk'd, nor sail'd by sea,
<A NAME="1021"></A><BR>But hither thro' the Aether made my way.
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR>By me, the Goddess who the fields befriends,
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR>These gifts, the greatest of all blessings, sends.
<A NAME="1024"></A><BR>The grain she gives if in your soil you sow,
<A NAME="1025"></A><BR>Thence wholsom food in golden crops shall grow.
<A NAME="1026"></A><BR><BR>Soon as the secret to the king was known,
<A NAME="1027"></A><BR>He grudg'd the glory of the service done,
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR>And wickedly resolv'd to make it all his own.
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR>To hide his purpose, he invites his guest,
<A NAME="1030"></A><BR>The friend of Ceres, to a royal feast,
<A NAME="1031"></A><BR>And when sweet sleep his heavy eyes had seiz'd,
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR>The tyrant with his steel attempts his breast.
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR>Him strait a lynx's shape the Goddess gives,
<A NAME="1034"></A><BR>And home the youth her sacred dragons drives.
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR><BR><B>The Pierides transform'd to Magpies</B>
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR><BR>The chosen Muse here ends her sacred lays;
<A NAME="1037"></A><BR>The nymphs unanimous decree the bays,
<A NAME="1038"></A><BR>And give the Heliconian Goddesses the praise.
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR>Then, far from vain that we shou'd thus prevail,
<A NAME="1040"></A><BR>But much provok'd to hear the vanquish'd rail,
<A NAME="1041"></A><BR>Calliope resumes: Too long we've born
<A NAME="1042"></A><BR>Your daring taunts, and your affronting scorn;
<A NAME="1043"></A><BR>Your challenge justly merited a curse,
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR>And this unmanner'd railing makes it worse.
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR>Since you refuse us calmly to enjoy
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR>Our patience, next our passions we'll employ;
<A NAME="1047"></A><BR>The dictates of a mind enrag'd pursue,
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR>And, what our just resentment bids us, do.
<A NAME="1049"></A><BR><BR>The railers laugh, our threats and wrath despise,
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR>And clap their hands, and make a scolding noise:
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR>But in the fact they're seiz'd; beneath their nails
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR>Feathers they feel, and on their faces scales;
<A NAME="1053"></A><BR>Their horny beaks at once each other scare,
<A NAME="1054"></A><BR>Their arms are plum'd, and on their backs they bear
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR>Py'd wings, and flutter in the fleeting air.
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR>Chatt'ring, the scandal of the woods they fly,
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR>And there continue still their clam'rous cry:
<A NAME="1058"></A><BR>The same their eloquence, as maids, or birds,
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR>Now only noise, and nothing then but words.
