<A NAME="start"></A>
<A NAME="10"></A><B>The Story of Orpheus and Eurydice</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>Thence, in his saffron robe, for distant Thrace,
<A NAME="12"></A><BR>Hymen departs, thro' air's unmeasur'd space;
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>By Orpheus call'd, the nuptial Pow'r attends,
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>But with ill-omen'd augury descends;
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>Nor chearful look'd the God, nor prosp'rous spoke,
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>Nor blaz'd his torch, but wept in hissing smoke.
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>In vain they whirl it round, in vain they shake,
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>No rapid motion can its flames awake.
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>With dread these inauspicious signs were view'd,
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>And soon a more disastrous end ensu'd;
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>For as the bride, amid the Naiad train,
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>Ran joyful, sporting o'er the flow'ry plain,
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>A venom'd viper bit her as she pass'd;
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>Instant she fell, and sudden breath'd her last.
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><BR>When long his loss the Thracian had deplor'd,
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>Not by superior Pow'rs to be restor'd;
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>Inflam'd by love, and urg'd by deep despair,
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>He leaves the realms of light, and upper air;
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>Daring to tread the dark Tenarian road,
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>And tempt the shades in their obscure abode;
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>Thro' gliding spectres of th' interr'd to go,
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>And phantom people of the world below:
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>Persephone he seeks, and him who reigns
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>O'er ghosts, and Hell's uncomfortable plains.
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>Arriv'd, he, tuning to his voice his strings,
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>Thus to the king and queen of shadows sings.
<A NAME="37"></A><BR><BR>Ye Pow'rs, who under Earth your realms extend,
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>To whom all mortals must one day descend;
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>If here 'tis granted sacred truth to tell:
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>I come not curious to explore your Hell;
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>Nor come to boast (by vain ambition fir'd)
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>How Cerberus at my approach retir'd.
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>My wife alone I seek; for her lov'd sake
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>These terrors I support, this journey take.
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>She, luckless wandring, or by fate mis-led,
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>Chanc'd on a lurking viper's crest to tread;
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>The vengeful beast, enflam'd with fury, starts,
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>And thro' her heel his deathful venom darts.
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>Thus was she snatch'd untimely to her tomb;
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>Her growing years cut short, and springing bloom.
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>Long I my loss endeavour'd to sustain,
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>And strongly strove, but strove, alas, in vain:
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>At length I yielded, won by mighty love;
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>Well known is that omnipotence above!
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>But here, I doubt, his unfelt influence fails;
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>And yet a hope within my heart prevails.
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>That here, ev'n here, he has been known of old;
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>At least if truth be by tradition told;
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>If fame of former rapes belief may find,
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>You both by love, and love alone, were join'd.
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>Now, by the horrors which these realms surround;
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>By the vast chaos of these depths profound;
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>By the sad silence which eternal reigns
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>O'er all the waste of these wide-stretching plains;
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>Let me again Eurydice receive,
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>Let Fate her quick-spun thread of life re-weave.
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>All our possessions are but loans from you,
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>And soon, or late, you must be paid your due;
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>Hither we haste to human-kind's last seat,
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>Your endless empire, and our sure retreat.
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>She too, when ripen'd years she shall attain,
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>Must, of avoidless right, be yours again:
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>I but the transient use of that require,
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>Which soon, too soon, I must resign entire.
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>But if the destinies refuse my vow,
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>And no remission of her doom allow;
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>Know, I'm determin'd to return no more;
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>So both retain, or both to life restore.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>Thus, while the bard melodiously complains,
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>And to his lyre accords his vocal strains,
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>The very bloodless shades attention keep,
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>And silent, seem compassionate to weep;
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>Ev'n Tantalus his flood unthirsty views,
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>Nor flies the stream, nor he the stream pursues;
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>Ixion's wond'ring wheel its whirl suspends,
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>And the voracious vulture, charm'd, attends;
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>No more the Belides their toil bemoan,
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>And Sisiphus reclin'd, sits list'ning on his stone.
<A NAME="89"></A><BR><BR>Then first ('tis said) by sacred verse subdu'd,
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>The Furies felt their cheeks with tears bedew'd:
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>Nor could the rigid king, or queen of Hell,
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>Th' impulse of pity in their hearts repell.
<A NAME="93"></A><BR><BR>Now, from a troop of shades that last arriv'd,
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>Eurydice was call'd, and stood reviv'd:
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>Slow she advanc'd, and halting seem to feel
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>The fatal wound, yet painful in her heel.
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>Thus he obtains the suit so much desir'd,
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>On strict observance of the terms requir'd:
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>For if, before he reach the realms of air,
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>He backward cast his eyes to view the fair,
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>The forfeit grant, that instant, void is made,
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>And she for ever left a lifeless shade.
<A NAME="103"></A><BR><BR>Now thro' the noiseless throng their way they 
<A NAME="104"></A>bend,
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>And both with pain the rugged road ascend;
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>Dark was the path, and difficult, and steep,
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>And thick with vapours from the smoaky deep.
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>They well-nigh now had pass'd the bounds of night,
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>And just approach'd the margin of the light,
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>When he, mistrusting lest her steps might stray,
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>And gladsome of the glympse of dawning day,
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>His longing eyes, impatient, backward cast
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>To catch a lover's look, but look'd his last;
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>For, instant dying, she again descends,
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>While he to empty air his arms extends.
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>Again she dy'd, nor yet her lord reprov'd;
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>What could she say, but that too well he lov'd?
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>One last farewell she spoke, which scarce he heard;
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>So soon she drop'd, so sudden disappear'd.
<A NAME="120"></A><BR><BR>All stunn'd he stood, when thus his wife he 
<A NAME="121"></A>view'd
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>By second Fate, and double death subdu'd:
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>Not more amazement by that wretch was shown,
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>Whom Cerberus beholding, turn'd to stone;
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>Nor Olenus cou'd more astonish'd look,
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>When on himself Lethaea's fault he took,
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>His beauteous wife, who too secure had dar'd
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>Her face to vye with Goddesses compar'd:
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>Once join'd by love, they stand united still,
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>Turn'd to contiguous rocks on Ida's hill.
<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR>Now to repass the Styx in vain he tries,
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>Charon averse, his pressing suit denies.
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>Sev'n days entire, along th' infernal shores,
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>Disconsolate, the bard Eurydice deplores;
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>Defil'd with filth his robe, with tears his cheeks,
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>No sustenance but grief, and cares, he seeks:
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>Of rigid Fate incessant he complains,
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>And Hell's inexorable Gods arraigns.
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>This ended, to high Rhodope he hastes,
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>And Haemus' mountain, bleak with northern blasts.
<A NAME="141"></A><BR><BR>And now his yearly race the circling sun
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>Had thrice compleat thro' wat'ry Pisces run,
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>Since Orpheus fled the face of womankind,
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>And all soft union with the sex declin'd.
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>Whether his ill success this change had bred,
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>Or binding vows made to his former bed;
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>Whate'er the cause, in vain the nymphs contest,
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>With rival eyes to warm his frozen breast:
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>For ev'ry nymph with love his lays inspir'd,
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>But ev'ry nymph repuls'd, with grief retir'd.
<A NAME="151"></A><BR><BR>A hill there was, and on that hill a mead,
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>With verdure thick, but destitute of shade.
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>Where, now, the Muse's son no sooner sings,
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>No sooner strikes his sweet resounding strings.
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>But distant groves the flying sounds receive,
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>And list'ning trees their rooted stations leave;
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>Themselves transplanting, all around they grow,
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>And various shades their various kinds bestow.
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>Here, tall Chaonian oaks their branches spread,
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>While weeping poplars there erect their head.
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>The foodful Esculus here shoots his leaves,
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>That turf soft lime-tree, this, fat beach receives;
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>Here, brittle hazels, lawrels here advance,
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>And there tough ash to form the heroe's lance;
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>Here silver firs with knotless trunks ascend,
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>There, scarlet oaks beneath their acorns bend.
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>That spot admits the hospitable plane,
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>On this, the maple grows with clouded grain;
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>Here, watry willows are with Lotus seen;
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>There, tamarisk, and box for ever green.
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>With double hue here mirtles grace the ground,
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>And laurestines, with purple berries crown'd.
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>With pliant feet, now, ivies this way wind,
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>Vines yonder rise, and elms with vines entwin'd.
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>Wild Ornus now, the pitch-tree next takes root,
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>And Arbutus adorn'd with blushing fruit.
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>Then easy-bending palms, the victor's prize,
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>And pines erect with bristly tops arise.
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>For Rhea grateful still the pine remains,
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>For Atys still some favour she retains;
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>He once in human shape her breast had warm'd,
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>And now is cherish'd, to a tree transform'd.
<A NAME="183"></A><BR><BR><B>The Fable of Cyparissus</B>
<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR>Amid the throng of this promiscuous wood,
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>With pointed top, the taper cypress stood;
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>A tree, which once a youth, and heav'nly fair,
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>Was of that deity the darling care,
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>Whose hand adapts, with equal skill, the strings
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>To bows with which he kills, and harps to which he 
<A NAME="190"></A>sings.
<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR>For heretofore, a mighty stag was bred,
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>Which on the fertile fields of Caea fed;
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>In shape and size he all his kind excell'd,
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>And to Carthaean nymphs was sacred held.
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>His beamy head, with branches high display'd,
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>Afforded to itself an ample shade;
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>His horns were gilt, and his smooth neck was grac'd
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>With silver collars thick with gems enchas'd:
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>A silver boss upon his forehead hung,
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>And brazen pendants in his ear-rings rung.
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>Frequenting houses, he familiar grew,
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>And learnt by custom, Nature to subdue;
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>'Till by degrees, of fear, and wildness, broke,
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>Ev'n stranger hands his proffer'd neck might stroak.
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR>Much was the beast by Caea's youth caress'd,
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>But thou, sweet Cyparissus, lov'dst him best:
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>By thee, to pastures fresh, he oft was led,
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>By thee oft water'd at the fountain's head:
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>His horns with garlands, now, by thee were ty'd,
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>And, now, thou on his back wou'dst wanton ride;
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>Now here, now there wou'dst bound along the plains,
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>Ruling his tender mouth with purple reins.
<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR>'Twas when the summer sun, at noon of day,
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>Thro' glowing Cancer shot his burning ray,
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>'Twas then, the fav'rite stag, in cool retreat,
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>Had sought a shelter from the scorching heat;
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>Along the grass his weary limbs he laid,
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>Inhaling freshness from the breezy shade:
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>When Cyparissus with his pointed dart,
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>Unknowing, pierc'd him to the panting heart.
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>But when the youth, surpriz'd, his error found,
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>And saw him dying of the cruel wound,
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>Himself he would have slain thro' desp'rate grief:
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>What said not Phoebus, that might yield relief!
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>To cease his mourning, he the boy desir'd,
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>Or mourn no more than such a loss requir'd.
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>But he, incessant griev'd: at length address'd
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>To the superior Pow'rs a last request;
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>Praying, in expiation of his crime,
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>Thenceforth to mourn to all succeeding time.
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR>And now, of blood exhausted he appears,
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>Drain'd by a torrent of continual tears;
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>The fleshy colour in his body fades,
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>And a green tincture all his limbs invades;
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>From his fair head, where curling locks late hung,
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>A horrid bush with bristled branches sprung,
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>Which stiffning by degrees, its stem extends,
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>'Till to the starry skies the spire ascends.
<A NAME="239"></A><BR><BR>Apollo sad look'd on, and sighing, cry'd,
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>Then, be for ever, what thy pray'r imply'd:
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>Bemoan'd by me, in others grief excite;
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>And still preside at ev'ry fun'ral rite.
<A NAME="243"></A><BR><BR>Thus the sweet artist in a wondrous shade
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>Of verdant trees, which harmony had made,
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>Encircled sate, with his own triumphs crown'd,
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>Of listning birds, and savages around.
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>Again the trembling strings he dext'rous tries,
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>Again from discord makes soft musick rise.
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>Then tunes his voice: O Muse, from whom I sprung,
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>Jove be my theme, and thou inspire my song.
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>To Jove my grateful voice I oft have rais'd,
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>Oft his almighty pow'r with pleasure prais'd.
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>I sung the giants in a solemn strain,
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>Blasted, and thunder-struck on Phlegra's plain.
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>Now be my lyre in softer accents mov'd,
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>To sing of blooming boys by Gods belov'd;
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>And to relate what virgins, void of shame,
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>Have suffer'd vengeance for a lawless flame.
<A NAME="259"></A><BR><BR>The King of Gods once felt the burning joy,
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>And sigh'd for lovely Ganimede of Troy:
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>Long was he puzzled to assume a shape
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>Most fit, and expeditious for the rape;
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>A bird's was proper, yet he scorns to wear
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>Any but that which might his thunder bear.
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>Down with his masquerading wings he flies,
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>And bears the little Trojan to the skies;
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>Where now, in robes of heav'nly purple drest,
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>He serves the nectar at th' Almighty's feast,
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>To slighted Juno an unwelcome guest.
<A NAME="270"></A><BR><BR><B>Hyacinthus transform'd into a Flower</B>
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>Phoebus for thee too, Hyacinth, design'd
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>A place among the Gods, had Fate been kind:
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>Yet this he gave; as oft as wintry rains
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>Are past, and vernal breezes sooth the plains,
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>From the green turf a purple flow'r you rise,
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>And with your fragrant breath perfume the skies.
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR>You when alive were Phoebus' darling boy;
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>In you he plac'd his Heav'n, and fix'd his joy:
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>Their God the Delphic priests consult in vain;
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>Eurotas now he loves, and Sparta's plain:
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>His hands the use of bow and harp forget,
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>And hold the dogs, or bear the corded net;
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>O'er hanging cliffs swift he pursues the game;
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>Each hour his pleasure, each augments his flame.
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>The mid-day sun now shone with equal light
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>Between the past, and the succeeding night;
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>They strip, then, smooth'd with suppling oyl, essay
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>To pitch the rounded quoit, their wonted play:
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>A well-pois'd disk first hasty Phoebus threw,
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>It cleft the air, and whistled as it flew;
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>It reach'd the mark, a most surprizing length;
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>Which spoke an equal share of art, and strength.
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>Scarce was it fall'n, when with too eager hand
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>Young Hyacinth ran to snatch it from the sand;
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>But the curst orb, which met a stony soil,
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>Flew in his face with violent recoil.
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>Both faint, both pale, and breathless now appear,
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>The boy with pain, the am'rous God with fear.
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>He ran, and rais'd him bleeding from the ground,
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>Chafes his cold limbs, and wipes the fatal wound:
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>Then herbs of noblest juice in vain applies;
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>The wound is mortal, and his skill defies.
<A NAME="303"></A><BR><BR>As in a water'd garden's blooming walk,
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>When some rude hand has bruis'd its tender stalk,
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>A fading lilly droops its languid head,
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>And bends to earth, its life, and beauty fled:
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>So Hyacinth, with head reclin'd, decays,
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>And, sickning, now no more his charms displays.
<A NAME="309"></A><BR><BR>O thou art gone, my boy, Apollo cry'd,
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>Defrauded of thy youth in all its pride!
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>Thou, once my joy, art all my sorrow now;
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>And to my guilty hand my grief I owe.
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>Yet from my self I might the fault remove,
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>Unless to sport, and play, a fault should prove,
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>Unless it too were call'd a fault to love.
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>Oh cou'd I for thee, or but with thee, dye!
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>But cruel Fates to me that pow'r deny.
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>Yet on my tongue thou shalt for ever dwell;
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>Thy name my lyre shall sound, my verse shall tell;
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>And to a flow'r transform'd, unheard-of yet,
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>Stamp'd on thy leaves my cries thou shalt repeat.
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>The time shall come, prophetick I foreknow,
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>When, joyn'd to thee, a mighty chief shall grow,
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>And with my plaints his name thy leaf shall show.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR>While Phoebus thus the laws of Fate reveal'd,
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>Behold, the blood which stain'd the verdant field,
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>Is blood no longer; but a flow'r full blown,
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>Far brighter than the Tyrian scarlet shone.
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>A lilly's form it took; its purple hue
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>Was all that made a diff'rence to the view,
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>Nor stop'd he here; the God upon its leaves
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>The sad expression of his sorrow weaves;
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>And to this hour the mournful purple wears
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>Ai, Ai, inscrib'd in funeral characters.
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>Nor are the Spartans, who so much are fam'd
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>For virtue, of their Hyacinth asham'd;
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>But still with pompous woe, and solemn state,
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>The Hyacinthian feasts they yearly celebrate
<A NAME="339"></A><BR><BR><B>The Transformations of the Cerastae and Propoetides</B>
<A NAME="340"></A><BR><BR>Enquire of Amathus, whose wealthy ground
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>With veins of every metal does abound,
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>If she to her Propoetides wou'd show,
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>The honour Sparta does to him allow?
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>Nor more, she'd say, such wretches wou'd we grace,
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>Than those whose crooked horns deform'd their face,
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>From thence Cerastae call'd, an impious race:
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>Before whose gates a rev'rend altar stood,
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>To Jove inscrib'd, the hospitable God:
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>This had some stranger seen with gore besmear'd,
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>The blood of lambs, and bulls it had appear'd:
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>Their slaughter'd guests it was; nor flock nor herd.
<A NAME="352"></A><BR><BR>Venus these barb'rous sacrifices view'd
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>With just abhorrence, and with wrath pursu'd:
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>At first, to punish such nefarious crimes,
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>Their towns she meant to leave, her once-lov'd climes:
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>But why, said she, for their offence shou'd I
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>My dear delightful plains, and cities fly?
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>No, let the impious people, who have sinn'd,
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>A punishment in death, or exile, find:
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>If death, or exile too severe be thought,
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>Let them in some vile shape bemoan their fault.
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>While next her mind a proper form employs,
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>Admonish'd by their horns, she fix'd her choice.
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>Their former crest remains upon their heads,
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>And their strong limbs an ox's shape invades.
<A NAME="366"></A><BR><BR>The blasphemous Propoetides deny'd
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>Worship of Venus, and her pow'r defy'd:
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>But soon that pow'r they felt, the first that sold
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>Their lewd embraces to the world for gold.
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>Unknowing how to blush, and shameless grown,
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>A small transition changes them to stone.
<A NAME="372"></A><BR><BR><B>The Story of Pygmalion and the Statue</B>
<A NAME="373"></A><BR><BR>Pygmalion loathing their lascivious life,
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>Abhorr'd all womankind, but most a wife:
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>So single chose to live, and shunn'd to wed,
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>Well pleas'd to want a consort of his bed.
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>Yet fearing idleness, the nurse of ill,
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>In sculpture exercis'd his happy skill;
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>And carv'd in iv'ry such a maid, so fair,
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>As Nature could not with his art compare,
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>Were she to work; but in her own defence
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>Must take her pattern here, and copy hence.
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>Pleas'd with his idol, he commends, admires,
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>Adores; and last, the thing ador'd, desires.
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>A very virgin in her face was seen,
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>And had she mov'd, a living maid had been:
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>One wou'd have thought she cou'd have stirr'd, but 
<A NAME="388"></A>strove
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>With modesty, and was asham'd to move.
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>Art hid with art, so well perform'd the cheat,
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>It caught the carver with his own deceit:
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>He knows 'tis madness, yet he must adore,
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>And still the more he knows it, loves the more:
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>The flesh, or what so seems, he touches oft,
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>Which feels so smooth, that he believes it soft.
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>Fir'd with this thought, at once he strain'd the 
<A NAME="397"></A>breast,
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>And on the lips a burning kiss impress'd.
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>'Tis true, the harden'd breast resists the gripe,
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>And the cold lips return a kiss unripe:
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>But when, retiring back, he look'd again,
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>To think it iv'ry, was a thought too mean:
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>So wou'd believe she kiss'd, and courting more,
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>Again embrac'd her naked body o'er;
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>And straining hard the statue, was afraid
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>His hands had made a dint, and hurt his maid:
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>Explor'd her limb by limb, and fear'd to find
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>So rude a gripe had left a livid mark behind:
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>With flatt'ry now he seeks her mind to move,
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>And now with gifts (the pow'rful bribes of love),
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>He furnishes her closet first; and fills
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>The crowded shelves with rarities of shells;
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>Adds orient pearls, which from the conchs he drew,
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>And all the sparkling stones of various hue:
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>And parrots, imitating human tongue,
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>And singing-birds in silver cages hung:
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>And ev'ry fragrant flow'r, and od'rous green,
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>Were sorted well, with lumps of amber laid between:
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>Rich fashionable robes her person deck,
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>Pendants her ears, and pearls adorn her neck:
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>Her taper'd fingers too with rings are grac'd,
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>And an embroider'd zone surrounds her slender waste.
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>Thus like a queen array'd, so richly dress'd,
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>Beauteous she shew'd, but naked shew'd the best.
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>Then, from the floor, he rais'd a royal bed,
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>With cov'rings of Sydonian purple spread:
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>The solemn rites perform'd, he calls her bride,
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>With blandishments invites her to his side;
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>And as she were with vital sense possess'd,
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>Her head did on a plumy pillow rest.
<A NAME="431"></A><BR><BR>The feast of Venus came, a solemn day,
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>To which the Cypriots due devotion pay;
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>With gilded horns the milk-white heifers led,
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>Slaughter'd before the sacred altars, bled.
<A NAME="435"></A><BR><BR>Pygmalion off'ring, first approach'd the shrine,
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>And then with pray'rs implor'd the Pow'rs divine:
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>Almighty Gods, if all we mortals want,
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>If all we can require, be yours to grant;
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>Make this fair statue mine, he wou'd have said,
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>But chang'd his words for shame; and only pray'd,
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>Give me the likeness of my iv'ry maid.
<A NAME="442"></A><BR><BR>The golden Goddess, present at the pray'r,
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>Well knew he meant th' inanimated fair,
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>And gave the sign of granting his desire;
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>For thrice in chearful flames ascends the fire.
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>The youth, returning to his mistress, hies,
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>And impudent in hope, with ardent eyes,
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>And beating breast, by the dear statue lies.
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>He kisses her white lips, renews the bliss,
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>And looks, and thinks they redden at the kiss;
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>He thought them warm before: nor longer stays,
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>But next his hand on her hard bosom lays:
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>Hard as it was, beginning to relent,
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>It seem'd, the breast beneath his fingers bent;
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>He felt again, his fingers made a print;
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>'Twas flesh, but flesh so firm, it rose against the 
<A NAME="457"></A>dint:
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>The pleasing task he fails not to renew;
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>Soft, and more soft at ev'ry touch it grew;
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>Like pliant wax, when chasing hands reduce
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>The former mass to form, and frame for use.
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>He would believe, but yet is still in pain,
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>And tries his argument of sense again,
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>Presses the pulse, and feels the leaping vein.
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>Convinc'd, o'erjoy'd, his studied thanks, and praise,
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>To her, who made the miracle, he pays:
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>Then lips to lips he join'd; now freed from fear,
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>He found the savour of the kiss sincere:
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>At this the waken'd image op'd her eyes,
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>And view'd at once the light, and lover with surprize.
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>The Goddess, present at the match she made,
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>So bless'd the bed, such fruitfulness convey'd,
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>That ere ten months had sharpen'd either horn,
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>To crown their bliss, a lovely boy was born;
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>Paphos his name, who grown to manhood, wall'd
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>The city Paphos, from the founder call'd.
<A NAME="477"></A><BR><BR><B>The Story of of Cinyras and Myrrha</B>
<A NAME="478"></A><BR><BR>Nor him alone produc'd the fruitful queen;
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>But Cinyras, who like his sire had been
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>A happy prince, had he not been a sire.
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>Daughters, and fathers, from my song retire;
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>I sing of horror; and could I prevail,
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>You shou'd not hear, or not believe my tale.
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>Yet if the pleasure of my song be such,
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>That you will hear, and credit me too much,
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>Attentive listen to the last event,
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>And, with the sin, believe the punishment:
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>Since Nature cou'd behold so dire a crime,
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>I gratulate at least my native clime,
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>That such a land, which such a monster bore,
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>So far is distant from our Thracian shore.
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>Let Araby extol her happy coast,
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>Her cinamon, and sweet Amomum boast,
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>Her fragrant flow'rs, her trees with precious tears,
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>Her second harvests, and her double years;
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>How can the land be call'd so bless'd, that Myrrha 
<A NAME="497"></A>bears?
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>Nor all her od'rous tears can cleanse her crime;
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>Her Plant alone deforms the happy clime:
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>Cupid denies to have inflam'd thy heart,
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>Disowns thy love, and vindicates his dart:
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>Some Fury gave thee those infernal pains,
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>And shot her venom'd vipers in thy veins.
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>To hate thy sire, had merited a curse;
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>But such an impious love deserv'd a worse.
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>The neighb'ring monarchs, by thy beauty led,
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>Contend in crowds, ambitious of thy bed:
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>The world is at thy choice; except but one,
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>Except but him, thou canst not chuse, alone.
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>She knew it too, the miserable maid,
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>Ere impious love her better thoughts betray'd,
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>And thus within her secret soul she said:
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>Ah Myrrha! whither wou'd thy wishes tend?
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>Ye Gods, ye sacred laws, my soul defend
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>From such a crime as all mankind detest,
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>And never lodg'd before in human breast!
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>But is it sin? Or makes my mind alone
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>Th' imagin'd sin? For Nature makes it none.
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>What tyrant then these envious laws began,
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>Made not for any other beast, but Man!
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>The father-bull his daughter may bestride,
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>The horse may make his mother-mare a bride;
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>What piety forbids the lusty ram,
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>Or more salacious goat, to rut their dam?
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>The hen is free to wed the chick she bore,
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>And make a husband, whom she hatch'd before.
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>All creatures else are of a happier kind,
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>Whom nor ill-natur'd laws from pleasure bind,
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>Nor thoughts of sin disturb their peace of mind.
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>But Man a slave of his own making lives;
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>The fool denies himself what Nature gives:
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>Too-busie senates, with an over-care,
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>To make us better than our kind can bear,
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>Have dash'd a spice of envy in the laws,
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>And straining up too high, have spoil'd the cause.
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>Yet some wise nations break their cruel chains,
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>And own no laws, but those which love ordains;
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>Where happy daughters with their sires are join'd,
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>And piety is doubly paid in kind.
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>O that I had been born in such a clime,
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>Not here, where 'tis the country makes the crime!
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>But whither wou'd my impious fancy stray?
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>Hence hopes, and ye forbidden thoughts away!
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>His worth deserves to kindle my desires,
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>But with the love, that daughters bear to sires.
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>Then had not Cinyras my father been,
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>What hinder'd Myrrha's hopes to be his queen?
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>But the perverseness of my fate is such,
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>That he's not mine, because he's mine too much:
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>Our kindred-blood debars a better tie;
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>He might be nearer, were he not so nigh.
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>Eyes, and their objects, never must unite;
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>Some distance is requir'd to help the sight:
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>Fain wou'd I travel to some foreign shore,
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>Never to see my native country more,
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>So might I to my self my self restore;
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>So might my mind these impious thoughts remove,
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>And ceasing to behold, might cease to love.
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>But stay I must, to feed my famish'd sight,
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>To talk, to kiss, and more, if more I might:
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>More, impious maid! What more canst thou design?
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>To make a monstrous mixture in thy line,
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>And break all statutes human and divine!
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>Can'st thou be call'd (to save thy wretched life)
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>Thy mother's rival, and thy father's wife?
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>Confound so many sacred names in one,
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>Thy brother's mother! Sister to thy son!
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>And fear'st thou not to see th' infernal bands,
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>Their heads with snakes; with torches arm'd their 
<A NAME="570"></A>hands
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>Full at thy face th' avenging brands to bear,
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>And shake the serpents from their hissing hair;
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>But thou in time th' increasing ill controul,
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>Nor first debauch the body by the soul;
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>Secure the sacred quiet of thy mind,
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>And keep the sanctions Nature has design'd.
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>Suppose I shou'd attempt, th' attempt were vain,
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>No thoughts like mine, his sinless soul profane;
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>Observant of the right: and o that he
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>Cou'd cure my madness, or be mad like me!
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>Thus she: but Cinyras, who daily sees
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>A crowd of noble suitors at his knees,
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>Among so many, knew not whom to chuse,
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>Irresolute to grant, or to refuse.
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>But having told their names, enquir'd of her
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>Who pleas'd her best, and whom she would prefer.
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>The blushing maid stood silent with surprize,
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>And on her father fix'd her ardent eyes,
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>And looking sigh'd, and as she sigh'd, began
<A NAME="590"></A><BR>Round tears to shed, that scalded as they ran.
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>The tender sire, who saw her blush, and cry,
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>Ascrib'd it all to maiden modesty,
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>And dry'd the falling drops, and yet more kind,
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>He stroak'd her cheeks, and holy kisses join'd.
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>She felt a secret venom fire her blood,
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>And found more pleasure, than a daughter shou'd;
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>And, ask'd again what lover of the crew
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>She lik'd the best, she answer'd, One like you.
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>Mistaking what she meant, her pious will
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>He prais'd, and bid her so continue still:
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>The word of pious heard, she blush'd with shame
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>Of secret guilt, and cou'd not bear the name.
<A NAME="603"></A><BR><BR>'Twas now the mid of night, when slumbers close
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>Our eyes, and sooth our cares with soft repose;
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>But no repose cou'd wretched Myrrha find,
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>Her body rouling, as she roul'd her mind:
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>Mad with desire, she ruminates her sin,
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>And wishes all her wishes o'er again:
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>Now she despairs, and now resolves to try;
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>Wou'd not, and wou'd again, she knows not why;
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>Stops, and returns; makes, and retracts the vow;
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>Fain wou'd begin, but understands not how.
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>As when a pine is hew'd upon the plains,
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>And the last mortal stroke alone remains,
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>Lab'ring in pangs of death, and threatning all,
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>This way, and that she nods, consid'ring where to 
<A NAME="617"></A>fall:
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>So Myrrha's mind, impell'd on either side,
<A NAME="619"></A><BR>Takes ev'ry bent, but cannot long abide;
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>Irresolute on which she shou'd relie,
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>At last, unfix'd in all, is only fix'd to die.
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>On that sad thought she rests, resolv'd on death,
<A NAME="623"></A><BR>She rises, and prepares to choak her breath:
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>Then while about the beam her zone she ties,
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>Dear Cinyras farewell, she softly cries;
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>For thee I die, and only wish to be
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>Not hated, when thou know'st die I for thee:
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>Pardon the crime, in pity to the cause:
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>This said, about her neck the noose she draws.
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>The nurse, who lay without, her faithful guard,
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>Though not the words, the murmurs over-heard;
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>And sighs, and hollow sounds: surpriz'd with fright,
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>She starts, and leaves her bed, and springs a light;
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>Unlocks the door, and entring out of breath,
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>The dying saw, and instruments of death;
<A NAME="636"></A><BR>She shrieks, she cuts the zone with trembling haste,
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>And in her arms her fainting charge embrac'd:
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>Next (for she now had leisure for her tears),
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>She weeping ask'd, in these her blooming years,
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>What unforeseen misfortune caus'd her care,
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>To loath her life, and languish in despair!
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>The maid, with down-cast eyes, and mute with grief
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>For death unfinish'd, and ill-tim'd relief,
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>Stood sullen to her suit: the beldame press'd
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>The more to know, and bar'd her wither'd breast,
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>Adjur'd her by the kindly food she drew
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>From those dry founts, her secret ill to shew.
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>Sad Myrrha sigh'd, and turn'd her eyes aside:
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>The nurse still urg'd, and wou'd not be deny'd:
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>Nor only promis'd secresie, but pray'd
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>She might have leave to give her offer'd aid.
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>Good-will, she said, my want of strength supplies,
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>And diligence shall give what age denies:
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>If strong desires thy mind to fury move,
<A NAME="655"></A><BR>With charms and med'cines I can cure thy love:
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>If envious eyes their hurtuful rays have cast,
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>More pow'rful verse shall free thee from the blast:
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>If Heav'n offended sends thee this disease,
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>Offended Heav'n with pray'rs we can appease.
<A NAME="660"></A><BR>What then remains, that can these cares procure?
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>Thy house is flourishing, thy fortune sure:
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>Thy careful mother yet in health survives,
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>And, to thy comfort, thy kind father lives.
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>The virgin started at her father's name,
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>And sigh'd profoundly, conscious of the shame
<A NAME="666"></A><BR>Nor yet the nurse her impious love divin'd,
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>But yet surmis'd that love disturb'd her mind:
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>Thus thinking, she pursu'd her point, and laid,
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>And lull'd within her lap the mourning maid;
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>Then softly sooth'd her thus; I guess your grief:
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>You love, my child; your love shall find relief.
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>My long-experienc'd age shall be your guide;
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>Rely on that, and lay distrust aside.
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>No breath of air shall on the secret blow,
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>Nor shall (what most you fear) your father know.
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>Struck once again, as with a thunder-clap,
<A NAME="677"></A><BR>The guilty virgin bounded from her lap,
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>And threw her body prostrate on the bed.
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>And, to conceal her blushes, hid her head;
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>There silent lay, and warn'd her with her hand
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>To go: but she receiv'd not the command;
<A NAME="682"></A><BR>Remaining still importunate to know:
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>Then Myrrha thus: Or ask no more, or go;
<A NAME="684"></A><BR>I pr'ythee go, or staying spare my shame;
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>What thou would'st hear, is impious ev'n to name.
<A NAME="686"></A><BR>At this, on high the beldame holds her hands,
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>And trembling both with age, and terror stands;
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>Adjures, and falling at her feet intreats,
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>Sooths her with blandishments, and frights with 
<A NAME="690"></A>threats,
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>To tell the crime intended, or disclose
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>What part of it she knew, if she no farther knows.
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>And last, if conscious to her counsel made,
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>Confirms anew the promise of her aid.
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>Now Myrrha rais'd her head; but soon oppress'd
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>With shame, reclin'd it on her nurse's breast;
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>Bath'd it with tears, and strove to have confess'd:
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>Twice she began, and stopp'd; again she try'd;
<A NAME="699"></A><BR>The falt'ring tongue its office still deny'd.
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>At last her veil before her face she spread,
<A NAME="701"></A><BR>And drew a long preluding sigh, and said,
<A NAME="702"></A><BR>O happy mother, in thy marriage-bed!
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>Then groan'd, and ceas'd. The good old woman shook,
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>Stiff were her eyes, and ghastly was her look:
<A NAME="705"></A><BR>Her hoary hair upright with horror stood,
<A NAME="706"></A><BR>Made (to her grief) more knowing than she wou'd.
<A NAME="707"></A><BR>Much she reproach'd, and many things she said,
<A NAME="708"></A><BR>To cure the madness of th' unhappy maid,
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>In vain: for Myrrha stood convict of ill;
<A NAME="710"></A><BR>Her reason vanquish'd, but unchang'd her will:
<A NAME="711"></A><BR>Perverse of mind, unable to reply;
<A NAME="712"></A><BR>She stood resolv'd, or to possess, or die.
<A NAME="713"></A><BR>At length the fondness of a nurse prevail'd
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>Against her better sense, and virtue fail'd:
<A NAME="715"></A><BR>Enjoy, my child, since such is thy desire,
<A NAME="716"></A><BR>Thy love, she said; she durst not say, thy sire:
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>Live, though unhappy, live on any terms;
<A NAME="718"></A><BR>Then with a second oath her faith confirms.
<A NAME="719"></A><BR><BR>The solemn feast of Ceres now was near,
<A NAME="720"></A><BR>When long white linnen stoles the matrons wear;
<A NAME="721"></A><BR>Rank'd in procession walk the pious train,
<A NAME="722"></A><BR>Off'ring first-fruits, and spikes of yellow grain:
<A NAME="723"></A><BR>For nine long nights the nuptial-bed they shun,
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>And sanctifying harvest, lie alone.
<A NAME="725"></A><BR><BR>Mix'd with the crowd, the queen forsook her 
<A NAME="726"></A>lord,
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>And Ceres' pow'r with secret rites ador'd:
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>The royal couch, now vacant for a time,
<A NAME="729"></A><BR>The crafty crone, officious in her crime,
<A NAME="730"></A><BR>The first occasion took: the king she found
<A NAME="731"></A><BR>Easie with wine, and deep in pleasures drown'd,
<A NAME="732"></A><BR>Prepar'd for love: the beldame blew the flame,
<A NAME="733"></A><BR>Confess'd the passion, but conceal'd the name.
<A NAME="734"></A><BR>Her form she prais'd; the monarch ask'd her years;
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>And she reply'd, The same thy Myrrha bears.
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>Wine, and commended beauty fir'd his thought;
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>Impatient, he commands her to be brought.
<A NAME="738"></A><BR>Pleas'd with her charge perform'd, she hies her 
<A NAME="739"></A>home,
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>And gratulates the nymph, the task was overcome.
<A NAME="741"></A><BR>Myrrha was joy'd the welcome news to hear;
<A NAME="742"></A><BR>But clog'd with guilt, the joy was unsincere:
<A NAME="743"></A><BR>So various, so discordant is the mind,
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>That in our will a diff'rent will we find.
<A NAME="745"></A><BR>Ill she presag'd, and yet pursu'd her lust;
<A NAME="746"></A><BR>For guilty pleasures give a double gust.
<A NAME="747"></A><BR><BR>'Twas depth of night: Arctophylax had driv'n
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>His lazy wain half round the northern Heav'n,
<A NAME="749"></A><BR>When Myrrha hasten'd to the crime desir'd:
<A NAME="750"></A><BR>The moon beheld her first, and first retir'd:
<A NAME="751"></A><BR>The stars amaz'd, ran backward from the sight,
<A NAME="752"></A><BR>And (shrunk within their sockets) lost their light.
<A NAME="753"></A><BR>Icarius first withdraws his holy flame:
<A NAME="754"></A><BR>The virgin sign, in Heav'n the second name,
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>Slides down the belt, and from her station flies,
<A NAME="756"></A><BR>And night with sable clouds involves the skies.
<A NAME="757"></A><BR>Bold Myrrha still pursues her black intent;
<A NAME="758"></A><BR>She stumbled thrice (an omen of th' event);
<A NAME="759"></A><BR>Thrice shriek'd the fun'ral owl, yet on she went,
<A NAME="760"></A><BR>Secure of shame, because secure of sight;
<A NAME="761"></A><BR>Ev'n bashful sins are impudent by night.
<A NAME="762"></A><BR>Link'd hand in hand, th' accomplice, and the dame,
<A NAME="763"></A><BR>Their way exploring, to the chamber came:
<A NAME="764"></A><BR>The door was ope; they blindly grope their way,
<A NAME="765"></A><BR>Where dark in bed th' expecting monarch lay.
<A NAME="766"></A><BR>Thus far her courage held, but here forsakes;
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>Her faint knees knock at ev'ry step she makes.
<A NAME="768"></A><BR>The nearer to her crime, the more within
<A NAME="769"></A><BR>She feels remorse, and horror of her sin;
<A NAME="770"></A><BR>Repents too late her criminal desire,
<A NAME="771"></A><BR>And wishes, that unknown she could retire.
<A NAME="772"></A><BR>Her lingring thus, the nurse (who fear'd delay
<A NAME="773"></A><BR>The fatal secret might at length betray)
<A NAME="774"></A><BR>Pull'd forward, to compleat the work begun,
<A NAME="775"></A><BR>And said to Cinyras, Receive thy own.
<A NAME="776"></A><BR>Thus saying, she deliver'd kind to kind,
<A NAME="777"></A><BR>Accurs'd, and their devoted bodies join'd.
<A NAME="778"></A><BR>The sire, unknowing of the crime, admits
<A NAME="779"></A><BR>His bowels, and prophanes the hallow'd sheets;
<A NAME="780"></A><BR>He found she trembled, but believ'd she strove
<A NAME="781"></A><BR>With maiden modesty against her love,
<A NAME="782"></A><BR>And sought with flatt'ring words vain fancies to 
<A NAME="783"></A>remove.
<A NAME="784"></A><BR>Perhaps he said, My daughter, cease thy fears
<A NAME="785"></A><BR>(Because the title suited with her years);
<A NAME="786"></A><BR>And, Father, she might whisper him again,
<A NAME="787"></A><BR>That names might not be wanting to the sin.
<A NAME="788"></A><BR><BR>Full of her sire, she left th' incestuous bed,
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>And carry'd in her womb the crime she bred.
<A NAME="790"></A><BR>Another, and another night she came;
<A NAME="791"></A><BR>For frequent sin had left no sense of shame:
<A NAME="792"></A><BR>'Till Cinyras desir'd to see her face,
<A NAME="793"></A><BR>Whose body he had held in close embrace,
<A NAME="794"></A><BR>And brought a taper; the revealer, light,
<A NAME="795"></A><BR>Expos'd both crime, and criminal to sight.
<A NAME="796"></A><BR>Grief, rage, amazement, could no speech afford,
<A NAME="797"></A><BR>But from the sheath he drew th' avenging sword:
<A NAME="798"></A><BR>The guilty fled: the benefit of night,
<A NAME="799"></A><BR>That favour'd first the sin, secur'd the flight.
<A NAME="800"></A><BR>Long wand'ring thro' the spacious fields, she bent
<A NAME="801"></A><BR>Her voyage to th' Arabian continent;
<A NAME="802"></A><BR>Then pass'd the region which Panchaea join'd,
<A NAME="803"></A><BR>And flying, left the palmy plains behind.
<A NAME="804"></A><BR>Nine times the moon had mew'd her horns; at length
<A NAME="805"></A><BR>With travel weary, unsupply'd with strength,
<A NAME="806"></A><BR>And with the burden of her womb oppress'd,
<A NAME="807"></A><BR>Sabaean fields afford her needful rest:
<A NAME="808"></A><BR>There, loathing life, and yet of death afraid,
<A NAME="809"></A><BR>In anguish of her spirit, thus she pray'd:
<A NAME="810"></A><BR>Ye Pow'rs, if any so propitious are
<A NAME="811"></A><BR>T' accept my penitence, and hear my pray'r;
<A NAME="812"></A><BR>Your judgments, I confess, are justly sent;
<A NAME="813"></A><BR>Great sins deserve as great a punishment:
<A NAME="814"></A><BR>Yet since my life the living will profane,
<A NAME="815"></A><BR>And since my death the happy dead will stain,
<A NAME="816"></A><BR>A middle state your mercy may bestow,
<A NAME="817"></A><BR>Betwixt the realms above, and those below:
<A NAME="818"></A><BR>Some other form to wretched Myrrha give,
<A NAME="819"></A><BR>Nor let her wholly die, nor wholly live.
<A NAME="820"></A><BR><BR>The pray'rs of penitents are never vain;
<A NAME="821"></A><BR>At least she did her last request obtain:
<A NAME="822"></A><BR>For while she spoke, the ground began to rise,
<A NAME="823"></A><BR>And gather'd round her feet, her legs, and thighs;
<A NAME="824"></A><BR>Her toes in roots descend, and spreading wide,
<A NAME="825"></A><BR>A firm foundation for the trunk provide:
<A NAME="826"></A><BR>Her solid bones convert to solid wood,
<A NAME="827"></A><BR>To pith her marrow, and to sap her blood:
<A NAME="828"></A><BR>Her arms are boughs, her fingers change their kind,
<A NAME="829"></A><BR>Her tender skin is harden'd into rind.
<A NAME="830"></A><BR>And now the rising tree her womb invests,
<A NAME="831"></A><BR>Now shooting upwards still, invades her breasts,
<A NAME="832"></A><BR>And shades the neck; when weary with delay,
<A NAME="833"></A><BR>She sunk her head within, and met it half the way.
<A NAME="834"></A><BR>And tho' with outward shape she lost her sense,
<A NAME="835"></A><BR>With bitter tears she wept her last offence;
<A NAME="836"></A><BR>And still she weeps, nor sheds her tears in vain;
<A NAME="837"></A><BR>For still the precious drops her name retain.
<A NAME="838"></A><BR>Mean-time the mis-begotten infant grows,
<A NAME="839"></A><BR>And ripe for birth, distends with deadly throes
<A NAME="840"></A><BR>The swelling rind, with unavailing strife,
<A NAME="841"></A><BR>To leave the wooden womb, and pushes into life.
<A NAME="842"></A><BR>The mother-tree, as if oppress'd with pain,
<A NAME="843"></A><BR>Writhes here, and there, to break the bark, in vain;
<A NAME="844"></A><BR>And, like a lab'ring woman, wou'd have pray'd,
<A NAME="845"></A><BR>But wants a voice to call Lucina's aid:
<A NAME="846"></A><BR>The bending bole sends out a hollow sound,
<A NAME="847"></A><BR>And trickling tears fall thicker on the ground.
<A NAME="848"></A><BR>The mild Lucina came uncall'd, and stood
<A NAME="849"></A><BR>Beside the struggling boughs, and heard the groaning 
<A NAME="850"></A>wood;
<A NAME="851"></A><BR>Then reach'd her midwife-hand to speed the throes,
<A NAME="852"></A><BR>And spoke the pow'rful spells, that babes to birth 
<A NAME="853"></A>disclose.
<A NAME="854"></A><BR>The bark divides, the living load to free,
<A NAME="855"></A><BR>And safe delivers the convulsive tree.
<A NAME="856"></A><BR>The ready nymphs receive the crying child,
<A NAME="857"></A><BR>And wash him in the tears the parent plant distill'd.
<A NAME="858"></A><BR>They swath'd him with their scarfs; beneath him 
<A NAME="859"></A>spread
<A NAME="860"></A><BR>The ground with herbs; with roses rais'd his head.
<A NAME="861"></A><BR>The lovely babe was born with ev'ry grace,
<A NAME="862"></A><BR>Ev'n envy must have prais'd so fair a face:
<A NAME="863"></A><BR>Such was his form, as painters when they show
<A NAME="864"></A><BR>Their utmost art, on naked loves bestow:
<A NAME="865"></A><BR>And that their arms no diff'rence might betray,
<A NAME="866"></A><BR>Give him a bow, or his from Cupid take away.
<A NAME="867"></A><BR>Time glides along with undiscover'd haste,
<A NAME="868"></A><BR>The future but a length behind the past;
<A NAME="869"></A><BR>So swift are years. The babe, whom just before
<A NAME="870"></A><BR>His grandsire got, and whom his sister bore;
<A NAME="871"></A><BR>The drop, the thing, which late the tree inclos'd,
<A NAME="872"></A><BR>And late the yawning bark to life expos'd;
<A NAME="873"></A><BR>A babe, a boy, a beauteous youth appears,
<A NAME="874"></A><BR>And lovelier than himself at riper years.
<A NAME="875"></A><BR>Now to the queen of love he gave desires,
<A NAME="876"></A><BR>And, with her pains, reveng'd his mother's fires.
<A NAME="877"></A><BR><BR><B>The Story of Venus and Adonis</B>
<A NAME="878"></A><BR><BR>For Cytherea's lips while Cupid prest,
<A NAME="879"></A><BR>He with a heedless arrow raz'd her breast,
<A NAME="880"></A><BR>The Goddess felt it, and with fury stung,
<A NAME="881"></A><BR>The wanton mischief from her bosom flung:
<A NAME="882"></A><BR>Yet thought at first the danger slight, but found
<A NAME="883"></A><BR>The dart too faithful, and too deep the wound.
<A NAME="884"></A><BR>Fir'd with a mortal beauty, she disdains
<A NAME="885"></A><BR>To haunt th' Idalian mount, or Phrygian plains.
<A NAME="886"></A><BR>She seeks not Cnidos, nor her Paphian shrines,
<A NAME="887"></A><BR>Nor Amathus, that teems with brazen mines:
<A NAME="888"></A><BR>Ev'n Heav'n itself with all its sweets unsought,
<A NAME="889"></A><BR>Adonis far a sweeter Heav'n is thought.
<A NAME="890"></A><BR>On him she hangs, and fonds with ev'ry art,
<A NAME="891"></A><BR>And never, never knows from him to part.
<A NAME="892"></A><BR>She, whose soft limbs had only been display'd
<A NAME="893"></A><BR>On rosie beds beneath the myrtle shade,
<A NAME="894"></A><BR>Whose pleasing care was to improve each grace,
<A NAME="895"></A><BR>And add more charms to an unrival'd face,
<A NAME="896"></A><BR>Now buskin'd, like the virgin huntress, goes
<A NAME="897"></A><BR>Thro' woods, and pathless wilds, and mountain-snows
<A NAME="898"></A><BR>With her own tuneful voice she joys to cheer
<A NAME="899"></A><BR>The panting hounds, that chace the flying deer.
<A NAME="900"></A><BR>She runs the labyrinth of fearful hares,
<A NAME="901"></A><BR>But fearless beasts, and dang'rous prey forbears,
<A NAME="902"></A><BR>Hunts not the grinning wolf, or foamy boar,
<A NAME="903"></A><BR>And trembles at the lion's hungry roar.
<A NAME="904"></A><BR>Thee too, Adonis, with a lover's care
<A NAME="905"></A><BR>She warns, if warn'd thou wou'dst avoid the snare,
<A NAME="906"></A><BR>To furious animals advance not nigh,
<A NAME="907"></A><BR>Fly those that follow, follow those that fly;
<A NAME="908"></A><BR>'Tis chance alone must the survivors save,
<A NAME="909"></A><BR>Whene'er brave spirits will attempt the brave.
<A NAME="910"></A><BR>O! lovely youth! in harmless sports delight;
<A NAME="911"></A><BR>Provoke not beasts, which, arm'd by Nature, fight.
<A NAME="912"></A><BR>For me, if not thy self, vouchsafe to fear;
<A NAME="913"></A><BR>Let not thy thirst of glory cost me dear.
<A NAME="914"></A><BR>Boars know not bow to spare a blooming age;
<A NAME="915"></A><BR>No sparkling eyes can sooth the lion's rage.
<A NAME="916"></A><BR>Not all thy charms a savage breast can move,
<A NAME="917"></A><BR>Which have so deeply touch'd the queen of love.
<A NAME="918"></A><BR>When bristled boars from beaten thickets spring,
<A NAME="919"></A><BR>In grinded tusks a thunderbolt they bring.
<A NAME="920"></A><BR>The daring hunters lions rouz'd devour,
<A NAME="921"></A><BR>Vast is their fury, and as vast their pow'r:
<A NAME="922"></A><BR>Curst be their tawny race! If thou would'st hear
<A NAME="923"></A><BR>What kindled thus my hate, then lend an ear:
<A NAME="924"></A><BR>The wond'rous tale I will to thee unfold,
<A NAME="925"></A><BR>How the fell monsters rose from crimes of old.
<A NAME="926"></A><BR>But by long toils I faint: see! wide-display'd,
<A NAME="927"></A><BR>A grateful poplar courts us with a shade.
<A NAME="928"></A><BR>The grassy turf, beneath, so verdant shows,
<A NAME="929"></A><BR>We may secure delightfully repose.
<A NAME="930"></A><BR>With her Adonis here be Venus blest;
<A NAME="931"></A><BR>And swift at once the grass and him she prest.
<A NAME="932"></A><BR>Then sweetly smiling, with a raptur'd mind,
<A NAME="933"></A><BR>On his lov'd bosom she her head reclin'd,
<A NAME="934"></A><BR>And thus began; but mindful still of bliss,
<A NAME="935"></A><BR>Seal'd the soft accents with a softer kiss.
<A NAME="936"></A><BR><BR>Perhaps thou may'st have heard a virgin's name,
<A NAME="937"></A><BR>Who still in swiftness swiftest youths o'ercame.
<A NAME="938"></A><BR>Wondrous! that female weakness should outdo
<A NAME="939"></A><BR>A manly strength; the wonder yet is true.
<A NAME="940"></A><BR>'Twas doubtful, if her triumphs in the field
<A NAME="941"></A><BR>Did to her form's triumphant glories yield;
<A NAME="942"></A><BR>Whether her face could with more ease decoy
<A NAME="943"></A><BR>A crowd of lovers, or her feet destroy.
<A NAME="944"></A><BR>For once Apollo she implor'd to show
<A NAME="945"></A><BR>If courteous Fates a consort would allow:
<A NAME="946"></A><BR>A consort brings thy ruin, he reply'd;
<A NAME="947"></A><BR>O! learn to want the pleasures of a bride!
<A NAME="948"></A><BR>Nor shalt thou want them to thy wretched cost,
<A NAME="949"></A><BR>And Atalanta living shall be lost.
<A NAME="950"></A><BR>With such a rueful Fate th' affrighted maid
<A NAME="951"></A><BR>Sought green recesses in the wood-land glade.
<A NAME="952"></A><BR>Nor sighing suiters her resolves could move,
<A NAME="953"></A><BR>She bad them show their speed, to show their love.
<A NAME="954"></A><BR>He only, who could conquer in the race,
<A NAME="955"></A><BR>Might hope the conquer'd virgin to embrace;
<A NAME="956"></A><BR>While he, whose tardy feet had lagg'd behind,
<A NAME="957"></A><BR>Was doom'd the sad reward of death to find.
<A NAME="958"></A><BR>Tho' great the prize, yet rigid the decree,
<A NAME="959"></A><BR>But blind with beauty, who can rigour see?
<A NAME="960"></A><BR>Ev'n on these laws the fair they rashly sought,
<A NAME="961"></A><BR>And danger in excess of love forgot.
<A NAME="962"></A><BR><BR>There sat Hippomenes, prepar'd to blame
<A NAME="963"></A><BR>In lovers such extravagance of flame.
<A NAME="964"></A><BR>And must, he said, the blessing of a wife
<A NAME="965"></A><BR>Be dearly purchas'd by a risk of life?
<A NAME="966"></A><BR>But when he saw the wonders of her face,
<A NAME="967"></A><BR>And her limbs naked, springing to the race,
<A NAME="968"></A><BR>Her limbs, as exquisitely turn'd, as mine,
<A NAME="969"></A><BR>Or if a woman thou, might vie with thine,
<A NAME="970"></A><BR>With lifted hands, he cry'd, forgive the tongue
<A NAME="971"></A><BR>Which durst, ye youths, your well-tim'd courage 
<A NAME="972"></A>wrong.
<A NAME="973"></A><BR>I knew not that the nymph, for whom you strove,
<A NAME="974"></A><BR>Deserv'd th' unbounded transports of your love.
<A NAME="975"></A><BR>He saw, admir'd, and thus her spotless frame
<A NAME="976"></A><BR>He prais'd, and praising, kindled his own flame.
<A NAME="977"></A><BR>A rival now to all the youths who run,
<A NAME="978"></A><BR>Envious, he fears they should not be undone.
<A NAME="979"></A><BR>But why (reflects he) idly thus is shown
<A NAME="980"></A><BR>The fate of others, yet untry'd my own?
<A NAME="981"></A><BR>The coward must not on love's aid depend;
<A NAME="982"></A><BR>The God was ever to the bold a friend.
<A NAME="983"></A><BR>Mean-time the virgin flies, or seems to fly,
<A NAME="984"></A><BR>Swift as a Scythian arrow cleaves the sky:
<A NAME="985"></A><BR>Still more and more the youth her charms admires.
<A NAME="986"></A><BR>The race itself t' exalt her charms conspires.
<A NAME="987"></A><BR>The golden pinions, which her feet adorn,
<A NAME="988"></A><BR>In wanton flutt'rings by the winds are born.
<A NAME="989"></A><BR>Down from her head, the long, fair tresses flow,
<A NAME="990"></A><BR>And sport with lovely negligence below.
<A NAME="991"></A><BR>The waving ribbands, which her buskins tie,
<A NAME="992"></A><BR>Her snowy skin with waving purple die;
<A NAME="993"></A><BR>As crimson veils in palaces display'd,
<A NAME="994"></A><BR>To the white marble lend a blushing shade.
<A NAME="995"></A><BR>Nor long he gaz'd, yet while he gaz'd, she gain'd
<A NAME="996"></A><BR>The goal, and the victorious wreath obtain'd.
<A NAME="997"></A><BR>The vanquish'd sigh, and, as the law decreed,
<A NAME="998"></A><BR>Pay the dire forfeit, and prepare to bleed.
<A NAME="999"></A><BR><BR>Then rose Hippomenes, not yet afraid,
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR>And fix'd his eyes full on the beauteous maid.
<A NAME="1001"></A><BR>Where is (he cry'd) the mighty conquest won,
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR>To distance those, who want the nerves to run?
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR>Here prove superior strength, nor shall it be
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR>Thy loss of glory, if excell'd by me.
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR>High my descent, near Neptune I aspire,
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR>For Neptune was grand-parent to my sire.
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR>From that great God the fourth my self I trace,
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR>Nor sink my virtues yet beneath my race.
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR>Thou from Hippomenes, o'ercome, may'st claim
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR>An envy'd triumph, and a deathless fame.
<A NAME="1011"></A><BR><BR>While thus the youth the virgin pow'r defies,
<A NAME="1012"></A><BR>Silent she views him still with softer eyes.
<A NAME="1013"></A><BR>Thoughts in her breast a doubtful strife begin,
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR>If 'tis not happier now to lose, than win.
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR>What God, a foe to beauty, would destroy
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR>The promis'd ripeness of this blooming boy?
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR>With his life's danger does he seek my bed?
<A NAME="1018"></A><BR>Scarce am I half so greatly worth, she said.
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR>Nor has his beauty mov'd my breast to love,
<A NAME="1020"></A><BR>And yet, I own, such beauty well might move:
<A NAME="1021"></A><BR>'Tis not his charms, 'tis pity would engage
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR>My soul to spare the greenness of his age.
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR>What, that heroick conrage fires his breast,
<A NAME="1024"></A><BR>And shines thro' brave disdain of Fate confest?
<A NAME="1025"></A><BR>What, that his patronage by close degrees
<A NAME="1026"></A><BR>Springs from th' imperial ruler of the seas?
<A NAME="1027"></A><BR>Then add the love, which bids him undertake
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR>The race, and dare to perish for my sake.
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR>Of bloody nuptials, heedless youth, beware!
<A NAME="1030"></A><BR>Fly, timely fly from a too barb'rous fair.
<A NAME="1031"></A><BR>At pleasure chuse; thy love will be repaid
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR>By a less foolish, and more beauteous maid.
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR>But why this tenderness, before unknown?
<A NAME="1034"></A><BR>Why beats, and pants my breast for him alone?
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR>His eyes have seen his num'rous rivals yield;
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR>Let him too share the rigour of the field,
<A NAME="1037"></A><BR>Since, by their fates untaught, his own he courts,
<A NAME="1038"></A><BR>And thus with ruin insolently sports.
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR>Yet for what crime shall he his death receive?
<A NAME="1040"></A><BR>Is it a crime with me to wish to live?
<A NAME="1041"></A><BR>Shall his kind passion his destruction prove?
<A NAME="1042"></A><BR>Is this the fatal recompence of love?
<A NAME="1043"></A><BR>So fair a youth, destroy'd, would conquest shame,
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR>Aud nymphs eternally detest my fame.
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR>Still why should nymphs my guiltless fame upbraid?
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR>Did I the fond adventurer persuade?
<A NAME="1047"></A><BR>Alas! I wish thou would'st the course decline,
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR>Or that my swiftness was excell'd by thine.
<A NAME="1049"></A><BR>See! what a virgin's bloom adorns the boy!
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR>Why wilt thou run, and why thy self destroy?
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR>Hippomenes! O that I ne'er had been
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR>By those bright eyes unfortunately seen!
<A NAME="1053"></A><BR>Ah! tempt not thus a swift, untimely Fate;
<A NAME="1054"></A><BR>Thy life is worthy of the longest date.
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR>Were I less wretched, did the galling chain
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR>Of rigid Gods not my free choice restrain,
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR>By thee alone I could with joy be led
<A NAME="1058"></A><BR>To taste the raptures of a nuptial bed.
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR><BR>Thus she disclos'd the woman's secret heart,
<A NAME="1060"></A><BR>Young, innocent, and new to Cupid's dart.
<A NAME="1061"></A><BR>Her thoughts, her words, her actions wildly rove,
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR>With love she burns, yet knows not that 'tis love.
<A NAME="1063"></A><BR><BR>Her royal sire now with the murm'ring crowd
<A NAME="1064"></A><BR>Demands the race impatiently aloud.
<A NAME="1065"></A><BR>Hippomenes then with true fervour pray'd,
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR>My bold attempt let Venus kindly aid.
<A NAME="1067"></A><BR>By her sweet pow'r I felt this am'rous fire,
<A NAME="1068"></A><BR>Still may she succour, whom she did inspire.
<A NAME="1069"></A><BR>A soft, unenvious wind, with speedy care,
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR>Wafted to Heav'n the lover's tender pray'r.
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR>Pity, I own, soon gain'd the wish'd consent,
<A NAME="1072"></A><BR>And all th' assistance he implor'd I lent.
<A NAME="1073"></A><BR>The Cyprian lands, tho' rich, in richness yield
<A NAME="1074"></A><BR>To that, surnam'd the Tamasenian field.
<A NAME="1075"></A><BR>That field of old was added to my shrine,
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR>And its choice products consecrated mine.
<A NAME="1077"></A><BR>A tree there stands, full glorious to behold,
<A NAME="1078"></A><BR>Gold are the leafs, the crackling branches gold.
<A NAME="1079"></A><BR>It chanc'd, three apples in my hand I bore,
<A NAME="1080"></A><BR>Which newly from the tree I sportive tore;
<A NAME="1081"></A><BR>Seen by the youth alone, to him I brought
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR>The fruit, and when, and how to use it, taught.
<A NAME="1083"></A><BR>The signal sounding by the king's command,
<A NAME="1084"></A><BR>Both start at once, and sweep th' imprinted sand.
<A NAME="1085"></A><BR>So swiftly mov'd their feet, they might with ease,
<A NAME="1086"></A><BR>Scarce moisten'd, skim along the glassy seas;
<A NAME="1087"></A><BR>Or with a wondrous levity be born
<A NAME="1088"></A><BR>O'er yellow harvests of unbending corn.
<A NAME="1089"></A><BR>Now fav'ring peals resound from ev'ry part,
<A NAME="1090"></A><BR>Spirit the youth, and fire his fainting heart.
<A NAME="1091"></A><BR>Hippomenes! (they cry'd) thy life preserve,
<A NAME="1092"></A><BR>Intensely labour, and stretch ev'ry nerve.
<A NAME="1093"></A><BR>Base fear alone can baffle thy design,
<A NAME="1094"></A><BR>Shoot boldly onward, and the goal is thine.
<A NAME="1095"></A><BR>'Tis doubtful whether shouts, like these, convey'd
<A NAME="1096"></A><BR>More pleasures to the youth, or to the maid.
<A NAME="1097"></A><BR>When a long distance oft she could have gain'd,
<A NAME="1098"></A><BR>She check'd her swiftness, and her feet restrain'd:
<A NAME="1099"></A><BR>She sigh'd, and dwelt, and languish'd on his face,
<A NAME="1100"></A><BR>Then with unwilling speed pursu'd the race.
<A NAME="1101"></A><BR>O'er-spent with heat, his breath he faintly drew,
<A NAME="1102"></A><BR>Parch'd was his mouth, nor yet the goal in view,
<A NAME="1103"></A><BR>And the first apple on the plain he threw.
<A NAME="1104"></A><BR>The nymph stop'd sudden at th' unusual sight,
<A NAME="1105"></A><BR>Struck with the fruit so beautifully bright.
<A NAME="1106"></A><BR>Aside she starts, the wonder to behold,
<A NAME="1107"></A><BR>And eager stoops to catch the rouling gold.
<A NAME="1108"></A><BR>Th' observant youth past by, and scour'd along,
<A NAME="1109"></A><BR>While peals of joy rung from th' applauding throng.
<A NAME="1110"></A><BR>Unkindly she corrects the short delay,
<A NAME="1111"></A><BR>And to redeem the time fleets swift away,
<A NAME="1112"></A><BR>Swift, as the lightning, or the northern wind,
<A NAME="1113"></A><BR>And far she leaves the panting youth behind.
<A NAME="1114"></A><BR>Again he strives the flying nymph to hold
<A NAME="1115"></A><BR>With the temptation of the second gold:
<A NAME="1116"></A><BR>The bright temptation fruitlessly was tost,
<A NAME="1117"></A><BR>So soon, alas! she won the distance lost.
<A NAME="1118"></A><BR>Now but a little interval of space
<A NAME="1119"></A><BR>Remain'd for the decision of the race.
<A NAME="1120"></A><BR>Fair author of the precious gift, he said,
<A NAME="1121"></A><BR>Be thou, O Goddess, author of my aid!
<A NAME="1122"></A><BR>Then of the shining fruit the last he drew,
<A NAME="1123"></A><BR>And with his full-collected vigour threw:
<A NAME="1124"></A><BR>The virgin still the longer to detain,
<A NAME="1125"></A><BR>Threw not directly, but a-cross the plain.
<A NAME="1126"></A><BR>She seem'd a-while perplex'd in dubious thought,
<A NAME="1127"></A><BR>If the far-distant apple should be sought:
<A NAME="1128"></A><BR>I lur'd her backward mind to seize the bait,
<A NAME="1129"></A><BR>And to the massie gold gave double weight.
<A NAME="1130"></A><BR>My favour to my votary was show'd,
<A NAME="1131"></A><BR>Her speed I lessen'd, and encreas'd her load.
<A NAME="1132"></A><BR>But lest, tho' long, the rapid race be run,
<A NAME="1133"></A><BR>Before my longer, tedious tale is done,
<A NAME="1134"></A><BR>The youth the goal, and so the virgin won.
<A NAME="1135"></A><BR><BR>Might I, Adonis, now not hope to see
<A NAME="1136"></A><BR>His grateful thanks pour'd out for victory?
<A NAME="1137"></A><BR>His pious incense on my altars laid?
<A NAME="1138"></A><BR>But he nor grateful thanks, nor incense paid.
<A NAME="1139"></A><BR>Enrag'd I vow'd, that with the youth the fair,
<A NAME="1140"></A><BR>For his contempt, should my keen vengeance share;
<A NAME="1141"></A><BR>That future lovers might my pow'r revere,
<A NAME="1142"></A><BR>And, from their sad examples, learn to fear.
<A NAME="1143"></A><BR>The silent fanes, the sanctify'd abodes,
<A NAME="1144"></A><BR>Of Cybele, great mother of the Gods,
<A NAME="1145"></A><BR>Rais'd by Echion in a lonely wood,
<A NAME="1146"></A><BR>And full of brown, religious horror stood.
<A NAME="1147"></A><BR>By a long painful journey faint, they chose!
<A NAME="1148"></A><BR>Their weary limbs here secret to repose.
<A NAME="1149"></A><BR>But soon my pow'r inflam'd the lustful boy,
<A NAME="1150"></A><BR>Careless of rest he sought untimely joy.
<A NAME="1151"></A><BR>A hallow'd gloomy cave, with moss o'er-grown,
<A NAME="1152"></A><BR>The temple join'd, of native pumice-stone,
<A NAME="1153"></A><BR>Where antique images by priests were kept.
<A NAME="1154"></A><BR>And wooden deities securely slept.
<A NAME="1155"></A><BR>Thither the rash Hippomenes retires,
<A NAME="1156"></A><BR>And gives a loose to all his wild desires,
<A NAME="1157"></A><BR>And the chaste cell pollutes with wanton fires.
<A NAME="1158"></A><BR>The sacred statues trembled with surprize,
<A NAME="1159"></A><BR>The tow'ry Goddess, blushing, veil'd her eyes;
<A NAME="1160"></A><BR>And the lewd pair to Stygian sounds had sent,
<A NAME="1161"></A><BR>But unrevengeful seem'd that punishment,
<A NAME="1162"></A><BR>A heavier doom such black prophaneness draws,
<A NAME="1163"></A><BR>Their taper figures turn to crooked paws.
<A NAME="1164"></A><BR>No more their necks the smoothness can retain,
<A NAME="1165"></A><BR>Now cover'd sudden with a yellow mane.
<A NAME="1166"></A><BR>Arms change to legs: each finds the hard'ning breast
<A NAME="1167"></A><BR>Of rage unknown, and wond'rous strength possest.
<A NAME="1168"></A><BR>Their alter'd looks with fury grim appear,
<A NAME="1169"></A><BR>And on the ground their brushing tails they hear.
<A NAME="1170"></A><BR>They haunt the woods: their voices, which before
<A NAME="1171"></A><BR>Were musically sweet, now hoarsly roar.
<A NAME="1172"></A><BR>Hence lions, dreadful to the lab'ring swains,
<A NAME="1173"></A><BR>Are tam'd by Cybele, and curb'd with reins,
<A NAME="1174"></A><BR>And humbly draw her car along the plains.
<A NAME="1175"></A><BR>But thou, Adonis, my delightful care,
<A NAME="1176"></A><BR>Of these, and beasts, as fierce as these, beware!
<A NAME="1177"></A><BR>The savage, which not shuns thee, timely shun,
<A NAME="1178"></A><BR>For by rash prowess should'st thou be undone,
<A NAME="1179"></A><BR>A double ruin is contain'd in one.
<A NAME="1180"></A><BR>Thus cautious Venus school'd her fav'rite boy;
<A NAME="1181"></A><BR>But youthful heat all cautions will destroy.
<A NAME="1182"></A><BR>His sprightly soul beyond grave counsels flies,
<A NAME="1183"></A><BR>While with yok'd swans the Goddess cuts the skies.
<A NAME="1184"></A><BR>His faithful hounds, led by the tainted wind,
<A NAME="1185"></A><BR>Lodg'd in thick coverts chanc'd a boar to find.
<A NAME="1186"></A><BR>The callow hero show'd a manly heart,
<A NAME="1187"></A><BR>And pierc'd the savage with a side-long dart.
<A NAME="1188"></A><BR>The flying savage, wounded, turn'd again,
<A NAME="1189"></A><BR>Wrench'd out the gory dart, and foam'd with pain.
<A NAME="1190"></A><BR>The trembling boy by flight his safety sought,
<A NAME="1191"></A><BR>And now recall'd the lore, which Venus taught;
<A NAME="1192"></A><BR>But now too late to fly the boar he strove,
<A NAME="1193"></A><BR>Who in the groin his tusks impetuous drove,
<A NAME="1194"></A><BR>On the discolour'd grass Adonis lay,
<A NAME="1195"></A><BR>The monster trampling o'er his beauteous prey.
<A NAME="1196"></A><BR><BR>Fair Cytherea, Cyprus scarce in view,
<A NAME="1197"></A><BR>Heard from afar his groans, and own'd them true,
<A NAME="1198"></A><BR>And turn'd her snowy swans, and backward flew.
<A NAME="1199"></A><BR>But as she saw him gasp his latest breath,
<A NAME="1200"></A><BR>And quiv'ring agonize in pangs of death,
<A NAME="1201"></A><BR>Down with swift flight she plung'd, nor rage forbore,
<A NAME="1202"></A><BR>At once her garments, and her hair she tore.
<A NAME="1203"></A><BR>With cruel blows she beat her guiltless breast,
<A NAME="1204"></A><BR>The Fates upbraided, and her love confest.
<A NAME="1205"></A><BR>Nor shall they yet (she cry'd) the whole devour
<A NAME="1206"></A><BR>With uncontroul'd, inexorable pow'r:
<A NAME="1207"></A><BR>For thee, lost youth, my tears, and restless pain
<A NAME="1208"></A><BR>Shall in immortal monuments remain,
<A NAME="1209"></A><BR>With solemn pomp in annual rites return'd,
<A NAME="1210"></A><BR>Be thou for ever, my Adonis, mourn'd,
<A NAME="1211"></A><BR>Could Pluto's queen with jealous fury storm,
<A NAME="1212"></A><BR>And Menthe to a fragrant herb transform?
<A NAME="1213"></A><BR>Yet dares not Venus with a change surprise,
<A NAME="1214"></A><BR>And in a flow'r bid her fall'n heroe rise?
<A NAME="1215"></A><BR>Then on the blood sweet nectar she bestows,
<A NAME="1216"></A><BR>The scented blood in little bubbles rose:
<A NAME="1217"></A><BR>Little as rainy drops, which flutt'ring fly,
<A NAME="1218"></A><BR>Born by the winds, along a low'ring sky.
<A NAME="1219"></A><BR>Short time ensu'd, 'till where the blood was shed,
<A NAME="1220"></A><BR>A flow'r began to rear its purple head:
<A NAME="1221"></A><BR>Such, as on Punick apples is reveal'd,
<A NAME="1222"></A><BR>Or in the filmy rind but half conceal'd.
