<A NAME="start"></A>
<A NAME="10"></A><B>The Creation of the World</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>Of bodies chang'd to various forms, I sing:
<A NAME="12"></A><BR>Ye Gods, from whom these miracles did spring,
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>Inspire my numbers with coelestial heat;
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>'Till I my long laborious work compleat:
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>And add perpetual tenour to my rhimes,
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>Deduc'd from Nature's birth, to Caesar's times.
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>Before the seas, and this terrestrial ball,
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>And Heav'n's high canopy, that covers all,
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>One was the face of Nature; if a face:
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>Rather a rude and indigested mass:
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>A lifeless lump, unfashion'd, and unfram'd,
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>Of jarring seeds; and justly Chaos nam'd.
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>No sun was lighted up, the world to view;
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>No moon did yet her blunted horns renew:
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>Nor yet was Earth suspended in the sky,
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>Nor pois'd, did on her own foundations lye:
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>Nor seas about the shores their arms had thrown;
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>But earth, and air, and water, were in one.
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>Thus air was void of light, and earth unstable,
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>And water's dark abyss unnavigable.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>No certain form on any was imprest;
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>All were confus'd, and each disturb'd the rest.
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>For hot and cold were in one body fixt;
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>And soft with hard, and light with heavy mixt.
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR>But God, or Nature, while they thus contend,
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>To these intestine discords put an end:
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>Then earth from air, and seas from earth were driv'n,
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>And grosser air sunk from aetherial Heav'n.
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>Thus disembroil'd, they take their proper place;
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>The next of kin, contiguously embrace;
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>And foes are sunder'd, by a larger space.
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>The force of fire ascended first on high,
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>And took its dwelling in the vaulted sky:
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>Then air succeeds, in lightness next to fire;
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>Whose atoms from unactive earth retire.
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>Earth sinks beneath, and draws a num'rous throng
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>Of pondrous, thick, unwieldy seeds along.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>About her coasts, unruly waters roar;
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>And rising, on a ridge, insult the shore.
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>Thus when the God, whatever God was he,
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>Had form'd the whole, and made the parts agree,
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>That no unequal portions might be found,
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>He moulded Earth into a spacious round:
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>Then with a breath, he gave the winds to blow;
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>And bad the congregated waters flow.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>He adds the running springs, and standing lakes;
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>And bounding banks for winding rivers makes.
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>Some part, in Earth are swallow'd up, the most
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>In ample oceans, disembogu'd, are lost.
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>He shades the woods, the vallies he restrains
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>With rocky mountains, and extends the plains.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR>And as five zones th' aetherial regions bind,
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>Five, correspondent, are to Earth assign'd:
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>The sun with rays, directly darting down,
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>Fires all beneath, and fries the middle zone:
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>The two beneath the distant poles, complain
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>Of endless winter, and perpetual rain.
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>Betwixt th' extreams, two happier climates hold
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>The temper that partakes of hot, and cold.
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>The fields of liquid air, inclosing all,
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>Surround the compass of this earthly ball:
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>The lighter parts lye next the fires above;
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>The grosser near the watry surface move:
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>Thick clouds are spread, and storms engender there,
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>And thunder's voice, which wretched mortals fear,
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>And winds that on their wings cold winter bear.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>Nor were those blustring brethren left at large,
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>On seas, and shores, their fury to discharge:
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>Bound as they are, and circumscrib'd in place,
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>They rend the world, resistless, where they pass;
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>And mighty marks of mischief leave behind;
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>Such is the rage of their tempestuous kind.
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>First Eurus to the rising morn is sent
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>(The regions of the balmy continent);
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>And Eastern realms, where early Persians run,
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>To greet the blest appearance of the sun.
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>Westward, the wanton Zephyr wings his flight;
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>Pleas'd with the remnants of departing light:
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>Fierce Boreas, with his off-spring, issues forth
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>T' invade the frozen waggon of the North.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>While frowning Auster seeks the Southern sphere;
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>And rots, with endless rain, th' unwholsom year.
<A NAME="93"></A><BR><BR>High o'er the clouds, and empty realms of wind,
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>The God a clearer space for Heav'n design'd;
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>Where fields of light, and liquid aether flow;
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>Purg'd from the pondrous dregs of Earth below.
<A NAME="97"></A><BR><BR>Scarce had the Pow'r distinguish'd these, when 
<A NAME="98"></A>streight
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>The stars, no longer overlaid with weight,
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>Exert their heads, from underneath the mass;
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>And upward shoot, and kindle as they pass,
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>And with diffusive light adorn their heav'nly place.
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>Then, every void of Nature to supply,
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>With forms of Gods he fills the vacant sky:
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>New herds of beasts he sends, the plains to share:
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>New colonies of birds, to people air:
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>And to their oozy beds, the finny fish repair.
<A NAME="108"></A><BR><BR>A creature of a more exalted kind
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>Was wanting yet, and then was Man design'd:
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>Conscious of thought, of more capacious breast,
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>For empire form'd, and fit to rule the rest:
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>Whether with particles of heav'nly fire
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>The God of Nature did his soul inspire,
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>Or Earth, but new divided from the sky,
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>And, pliant, still retain'd th' aetherial energy:
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>Which wise Prometheus temper'd into paste,
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>And, mixt with living streams, the godlike image 
<A NAME="118"></A>cast.
<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR>Thus, while the mute creation downward bend
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>Their sight, and to their earthly mother tend,
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>Man looks aloft; and with erected eyes
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>Beholds his own hereditary skies.
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>From such rude principles our form began;
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>And earth was metamorphos'd into Man.
<A NAME="125"></A><BR><BR><B>The Golden Age</B>
<A NAME="126"></A><BR><BR>The golden age was first; when Man yet new,
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>No rule but uncorrupted reason knew:
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>And, with a native bent, did good pursue.
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>Unforc'd by punishment, un-aw'd by fear,
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>His words were simple, and his soul sincere;
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>Needless was written law, where none opprest:
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>The law of Man was written in his breast:
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>No suppliant crowds before the judge appear'd,
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>No court erected yet, nor cause was heard:
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>But all was safe, for conscience was their guard.
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>The mountain-trees in distant prospect please,
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>E're yet the pine descended to the seas:
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>E're sails were spread, new oceans to explore:
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>And happy mortals, unconcern'd for more,
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>Confin'd their wishes to their native shore.
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>No walls were yet; nor fence, nor mote, nor mound,
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>Nor drum was heard, nor trumpet's angry sound:
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>Nor swords were forg'd; but void of care and crime,
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>The soft creation slept away their time.
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>The teeming Earth, yet guiltless of the plough,
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>And unprovok'd, did fruitful stores allow:
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>Content with food, which Nature freely bred,
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>On wildings and on strawberries they fed;
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>Cornels and bramble-berries gave the rest,
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>And falling acorns furnish'd out a feast.
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>The flow'rs unsown, in fields and meadows reign'd:
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>And Western winds immortal spring maintain'd.
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>In following years, the bearded corn ensu'd
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>From Earth unask'd, nor was that Earth renew'd.
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>From veins of vallies, milk and nectar broke;
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>And honey sweating through the pores of oak.
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR><B>The Silver Age</B>
<A NAME="158"></A><BR><BR>But when good Saturn, banish'd from above,
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>Was driv'n to Hell, the world was under Jove.
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>Succeeding times a silver age behold,
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>Excelling brass, but more excell'd by gold.
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>Then summer, autumn, winter did appear:
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>And spring was but a season of the year.
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>The sun his annual course obliquely made,
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>Good days contracted, and enlarg'd the bad.
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>Then air with sultry heats began to glow;
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>The wings of winds were clogg'd with ice and snow;
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>And shivering mortals, into houses driv'n,
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>Sought shelter from th' inclemency of Heav'n.
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>Those houses, then, were caves, or homely sheds;
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>With twining oziers fenc'd; and moss their beds.
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>Then ploughs, for seed, the fruitful furrows broke,
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>And oxen labour'd first beneath the yoke.
<A NAME="174"></A><BR><BR><B>The Brazen Age</B>
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR>To this came next in course, the brazen age:
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>A warlike offspring, prompt to bloody rage,
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>Not impious yet...
<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR><B>The Iron Age</B>
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR>Hard steel succeeded then:
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>And stubborn as the metal, were the men.
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>Truth, modesty, and shame, the world forsook:
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>Fraud, avarice, and force, their places took.
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>Then sails were spread, to every wind that blew.
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>Raw were the sailors, and the depths were new:
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>Trees, rudely hollow'd, did the waves sustain;
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>E're ships in triumph plough'd the watry plain.
<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR>Then land-marks limited to each his right:
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>For all before was common as the light.
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>Nor was the ground alone requir'd to bear
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>Her annual income to the crooked share,
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>But greedy mortals, rummaging her store,
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>Digg'd from her entrails first the precious oar;
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>Which next to Hell, the prudent Gods had laid;
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>And that alluring ill, to sight display'd.
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>Thus cursed steel, and more accursed gold,
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>Gave mischief birth, and made that mischief bold:
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>And double death did wretched Man invade,
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>By steel assaulted, and by gold betray'd,
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>Now (brandish'd weapons glittering in their hands)
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>Mankind is broken loose from moral bands;
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>No rights of hospitality remain:
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>The guest, by him who harbour'd him, is slain,
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>The son-in-law pursues the father's life;
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>The wife her husband murders, he the wife.
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>The step-dame poyson for the son prepares;
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>The son inquires into his father's years.
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>Faith flies, and piety in exile mourns;
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>And justice, here opprest, to Heav'n returns.
<A NAME="209"></A><BR><BR><B>The Giants' War</B>
<A NAME="210"></A><BR><BR>Nor were the Gods themselves more safe above;
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>Against beleaguer'd Heav'n the giants move.
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>Hills pil'd on hills, on mountains mountains lie,
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>To make their mad approaches to the skie.
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>'Till Jove, no longer patient, took his time
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>T' avenge with thunder their audacious crime:
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>Red light'ning plaid along the firmament,
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>And their demolish'd works to pieces rent.
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>Sing'd with the flames, and with the bolts transfixt,
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>With native Earth, their blood the monsters mixt;
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>The blood, indu'd with animating heat,
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>Did in th' impregnant Earth new sons beget:
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>They, like the seed from which they sprung, accurst,
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>Against the Gods immortal hatred nurst,
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>An impious, arrogant, and cruel brood;
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>Expressing their original from blood.
<A NAME="226"></A><BR><BR>Which when the king of Gods beheld from high
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>(Withal revolving in his memory,
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>What he himself had found on Earth of late,
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>Lycaon's guilt, and his inhumane treat),
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>He sigh'd; nor longer with his pity strove;
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>But kindled to a wrath becoming Jove:
<A NAME="232"></A><BR><BR>Then call'd a general council of the Gods;
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>Who summon'd, issue from their blest abodes,
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>And fill th' assembly with a shining train.
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>A way there is, in Heav'n's expanded plain,
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>Which, when the skies are clear, is seen below,
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>And mortals, by the name of Milky, know.
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>The ground-work is of stars; through which the road
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>Lyes open to the Thunderer's abode:
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>The Gods of greater nations dwell around,
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>And, on the right and left, the palace bound;
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>The commons where they can: the nobler sort
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>With winding-doors wide open, front the court.
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>This place, as far as Earth with Heav'n may vie,
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>I dare to call the Louvre of the skie.
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>When all were plac'd, in seats distinctly known,
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>And he, their father, had assum'd the throne,
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>Upon his iv'ry sceptre first he leant,
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>Then shook his head, that shook the firmament:
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>Air, Earth, and seas, obey'd th' almighty nod;
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>And, with a gen'ral fear, confess'd the God.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>At length, with indignation, thus he broke
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>His awful silence, and the Pow'rs bespoke.
<A NAME="254"></A><BR><BR>I was not more concern'd in that debate
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>Of empire, when our universal state
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>Was put to hazard, and the giant race
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>Our captive skies were ready to imbrace:
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>For tho' the foe was fierce, the seeds of all
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>Rebellion, sprung from one original;
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>Now, wheresoever ambient waters glide,
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>All are corrupt, and all must be destroy'd.
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>Let me this holy protestation make,
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>By Hell, and Hell's inviolable lake,
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>I try'd whatever in the godhead lay:
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>But gangren'd members must be lopt away,
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>Before the nobler parts are tainted to decay.
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>There dwells below, a race of demi-gods,
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>Of nymphs in waters, and of fawns in woods:
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>Who, tho' not worthy yet, in Heav'n to live,
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>Let 'em, at least, enjoy that Earth we give.
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>Can these be thought securely lodg'd below,
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>When I my self, who no superior know,
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>I, who have Heav'n and Earth at my command,
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>Have been attempted by Lycaon's hand?
<A NAME="275"></A><BR><BR>At this a murmur through the synod went,
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>And with one voice they vote his punishment.
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>Thus, when conspiring traytors dar'd to doom
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>The fall of Caesar, and in him of Rome,
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>The nations trembled with a pious fear;
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>All anxious for their earthly Thunderer:
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>Nor was their care, o Caesar, less esteem'd
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>By thee, than that of Heav'n for Jove was deem'd:
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>Who with his hand, and voice, did first restrain
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>Their murmurs, then resum'd his speech again.
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>The Gods to silence were compos'd, and sate
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>With reverence, due to his superior state.
<A NAME="287"></A><BR><BR>Cancel your pious cares; already he
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>Has paid his debt to justice, and to me.
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>Yet what his crimes, and what my judgments were,
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>Remains for me thus briefly to declare.
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>The clamours of this vile degenerate age,
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>The cries of orphans, and th' oppressor's rage,
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>Had reach'd the stars: I will descend, said I,
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>In hope to prove this loud complaint a lye.
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>Disguis'd in humane shape, I travell'd round
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>The world, and more than what I heard, I found.
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>O'er Maenalus I took my steepy way,
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>By caverns infamous for beasts of prey:
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>Then cross'd Cyllene, and the piny shade
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>More infamous, by curst Lycaon made:
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>Dark night had cover'd Heaven, and Earth, before
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>I enter'd his unhospitable door.
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>Just at my entrance, I display'd the sign
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>That somewhat was approaching of divine.
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>The prostrate people pray; the tyrant grins;
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>And, adding prophanation to his sins,
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>I'll try, said he, and if a God appear,
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>To prove his deity shall cost him dear.
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>'Twas late; the graceless wretch my death prepares,
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>When I shou'd soundly sleep, opprest with cares:
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>This dire experiment he chose, to prove
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>If I were mortal, or undoubted Jove:
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>But first he had resolv'd to taste my pow'r;
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>Not long before, but in a luckless hour,
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>Some legates, sent from the Molossian state,
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>Were on a peaceful errand come to treat:
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>Of these he murders one, he boils the flesh;
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>And lays the mangled morsels in a dish:
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>Some part he roasts; then serves it up, so drest,
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>And bids me welcome to this humane feast.
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>Mov'd with disdain, the table I o'er-turn'd;
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>And with avenging flames, the palace burn'd.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>The tyrant in a fright, for shelter gains
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>The neighb'ring fields, and scours along the plains.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>Howling he fled, and fain he wou'd have spoke;
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>But humane voice his brutal tongue forsook.
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>About his lips the gather'd foam he churns,
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>And, breathing slaughters, still with rage he burns,
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>But on the bleating flock his fury turns.
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>His mantle, now his hide, with rugged hairs
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>Cleaves to his back; a famish'd face he bears;
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>His arms descend, his shoulders sink away
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>To multiply his legs for chase of prey.
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>He grows a wolf, his hoariness remains,
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>And the same rage in other members reigns.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>His eyes still sparkle in a narr'wer space:
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>His jaws retain the grin, and violence of his face
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR>This was a single ruin, but not one
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>Deserves so just a punishment alone.
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>Mankind's a monster, and th' ungodly times
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>Confed'rate into guilt, are sworn to crimes.
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>All are alike involv'd in ill, and all
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>Must by the same relentless fury fall.
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>Thus ended he; the greater Gods assent;
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>By clamours urging his severe intent;
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>The less fill up the cry for punishment.
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>Yet still with pity they remember Man;
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>And mourn as much as heav'nly spirits can.
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>They ask, when those were lost of humane birth,
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>What he wou'd do with all this waste of Earth:
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>If his dispeopl'd world he would resign
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>To beasts, a mute, and more ignoble line;
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>Neglected altars must no longer smoke,
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>If none were left to worship, and invoke.
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>To whom the Father of the Gods reply'd,
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>Lay that unnecessary fear aside:
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>Mine be the care, new people to provide.
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>I will from wondrous principles ordain
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>A race unlike the first, and try my skill again.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR>Already had he toss'd the flaming brand;
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>And roll'd the thunder in his spacious hand;
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>Preparing to discharge on seas and land:
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>But stopt, for fear, thus violently driv'n,
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>The sparks should catch his axle-tree of Heav'n.
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>Remembring in the fates, a time when fire
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>Shou'd to the battlements of Heaven aspire,
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>And all his blazing worlds above shou'd burn;
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>And all th' inferior globe to cinders turn.
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>His dire artill'ry thus dismist, he bent
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>His thoughts to some securer punishment:
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>Concludes to pour a watry deluge down;
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>And what he durst not burn, resolves to drown.
<A NAME="373"></A><BR><BR>The northern breath, that freezes floods, he 
<A NAME="374"></A>binds;
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>With all the race of cloud-dispelling winds:
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>The south he loos'd, who night and horror brings;
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>And foggs are shaken from his flaggy wings.
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>From his divided beard two streams he pours,
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>His head, and rheumy eyes distill in show'rs,
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>With rain his robe, and heavy mantle flow:
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>And lazy mists are lowring on his brow;
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>Still as he swept along, with his clench'd fist
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>He squeez'd the clouds, th' imprison'd clouds resist:
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>The skies, from pole to pole, with peals resound;
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>And show'rs inlarg'd, come pouring on the ground.
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>Then, clad in colours of a various dye,
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>Junonian Iris breeds a new supply
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>To feed the clouds: impetuous rain descends;
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>The bearded corn beneath the burden bends:
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>Defrauded clowns deplore their perish'd grain;
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>And the long labours of the year are vain.
<A NAME="392"></A><BR><BR>Nor from his patrimonial Heaven alone
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>Is Jove content to pour his vengeance down;
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>Aid from his brother of the seas he craves,
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>To help him with auxiliary waves.
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>The watry tyrant calls his brooks and floods,
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>Who rowl from mossie caves (their moist abodes);
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>And with perpetual urns his palace fill:
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>To whom in brief, he thus imparts his will.
<A NAME="400"></A><BR><BR>Small exhortation needs; your pow'rs employ:
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>And this bad world, so Jove requires, destroy.
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>Let loose the reins to all your watry store:
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>Bear down the damms, and open ev'ry door.
<A NAME="404"></A><BR><BR>The floods, by Nature enemies to land,
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>And proudly swelling with their new command,
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>Remove the living stones, that stopt their way,
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>And gushing from their source, augment the sea.
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>Then, with his mace, their monarch struck the ground;
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>With inward trembling Earth receiv'd the wound;
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>And rising streams a ready passage found.
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>Th' expanded waters gather on the plain:
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>They float the fields, and over-top the grain;
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>Then rushing onwards, with a sweepy sway,
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>Bear flocks, and folds, and lab'ring hinds away.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>Nor safe their dwellings were, for, sap'd by floods,
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>Their houses fell upon their houshold Gods.
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>The solid piles, too strongly built to fall,
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>High o'er their heads, behold a watry wall:
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>Now seas and Earth were in confusion lost;
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>A world of waters, and without a coast.
<A NAME="421"></A><BR><BR>One climbs a cliff; one in his boat is born:
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>And ploughs above, where late he sow'd his corn.
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>Others o'er chimney-tops and turrets row,
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>And drop their anchors on the meads below:
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>Or downward driv'n, they bruise the tender vine,
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>Or tost aloft, are knock'd against a pine.
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>And where of late the kids had cropt the grass,
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>The monsters of the deep now take their place.
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>Insulting Nereids on the cities ride,
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>And wond'ring dolphins o'er the palace glide.
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>On leaves, and masts of mighty oaks they brouze;
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>And their broad fins entangle in the boughs.
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>The frighted wolf now swims amongst the sheep;
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>The yellow lion wanders in the deep:
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>His rapid force no longer helps the boar:
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>The stag swims faster, than he ran before.
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>The fowls, long beating on their wings in vain,
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>Despair of land, and drop into the main.
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>Now hills, and vales no more distinction know;
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>And levell'd Nature lies oppress'd below.
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>The most of mortals perish in the flood:
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>The small remainder dies for want of food.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR><BR>A mountain of stupendous height there stands
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>Betwixt th' Athenian and Boeotian lands,
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>The bound of fruitful fields, while fields they 
<A NAME="446"></A>were,
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>But then a field of waters did appear:
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>Parnassus is its name; whose forky rise
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>Mounts thro' the clouds, and mates the lofty skies.
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>High on the summit of this dubious cliff,
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>Deucalion wafting, moor'd his little skiff.
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>He with his wife were only left behind
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>Of perish'd Man; they two were human kind.
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>The mountain nymphs, and Themis they adore,
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>And from her oracles relief implore.
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>The most upright of mortal men was he;
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>The most sincere, and holy woman, she.
<A NAME="458"></A><BR><BR>When Jupiter, surveying Earth from high,
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>Beheld it in a lake of water lie,
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>That where so many millions lately liv'd,
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>But two, the best of either sex, surviv'd;
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>He loos'd the northern wind; fierce Boreas flies
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>To puff away the clouds, and purge the skies:
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>Serenely, while he blows, the vapours driv'n,
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>Discover Heav'n to Earth, and Earth to Heav'n.
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>The billows fall, while Neptune lays his mace
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>On the rough sea, and smooths its furrow'd face.
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>Already Triton, at his call, appears
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>Above the waves; a Tyrian robe he wears;
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>And in his hand a crooked trumpet bears.
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>The soveraign bids him peaceful sounds inspire,
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>And give the waves the signal to retire.
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>His writhen shell he takes; whose narrow vent
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>Grows by degrees into a large extent,
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>Then gives it breath; the blast with doubling sound,
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>Runs the wide circuit of the world around:
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>The sun first heard it, in his early east,
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>And met the rattling ecchos in the west.
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>The waters, listning to the trumpet's roar,
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>Obey the summons, and forsake the shore.
<A NAME="481"></A><BR><BR>A thin circumference of land appears;
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>And Earth, but not at once, her visage rears,
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>And peeps upon the seas from upper grounds;
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>The streams, but just contain'd within their bounds,
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>By slow degrees into their channels crawl;
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>And Earth increases, as the waters fall.
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>In longer time the tops of trees appear,
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>Which mud on their dishonour'd branches bear.
<A NAME="489"></A><BR><BR>At length the world was all restor'd to view;
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>But desolate, and of a sickly hue:
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>Nature beheld her self, and stood aghast,
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>A dismal desart, and a silent waste.
<A NAME="493"></A><BR><BR>Which when Deucalion, with a piteous look
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>Beheld, he wept, and thus to Pyrrha spoke:
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>Oh wife, oh sister, oh of all thy kind
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>The best, and only creature left behind,
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>By kindred, love, and now by dangers joyn'd;
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>Of multitudes, who breath'd the common air,
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>We two remain; a species in a pair:
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>The rest the seas have swallow'd; nor have we
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>Ev'n of this wretched life a certainty.
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>The clouds are still above; and, while I speak,
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>A second deluge o'er our heads may break.
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>Shou'd I be snatcht from hence, and thou remain,
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>Without relief, or partner of thy pain,
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>How cou'dst thou such a wretched life sustain?
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>Shou'd I be left, and thou be lost, the sea
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>That bury'd her I lov'd, shou'd bury me.
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>Oh cou'd our father his old arts inspire,
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>And make me heir of his informing fire,
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>That so I might abolisht Man retrieve,
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>And perisht people in new souls might live.
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>But Heav'n is pleas'd, nor ought we to complain,
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>That we, th' examples of mankind, remain.
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>He said; the careful couple joyn their tears:
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>And then invoke the Gods, with pious prayers.
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>Thus, in devotion having eas'd their grief,
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>From sacred oracles they seek relief;
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>And to Cephysus' brook their way pursue:
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>The stream was troubled, but the ford they knew;
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>With living waters, in the fountain bred,
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>They sprinkle first their garments, and their head,
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>Then took the way, which to the temple led.
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>The roofs were all defil'd with moss, and mire,
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>The desart altars void of solemn fire.
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>Before the gradual, prostrate they ador'd;
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>The pavement kiss'd; and thus the saint implor'd.
<A NAME="528"></A><BR><BR>O righteous Themis, if the Pow'rs above
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>By pray'rs are bent to pity, and to love;
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>If humane miseries can move their mind;
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>If yet they can forgive, and yet be kind;
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>Tell how we may restore, by second birth,
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>Mankind, and people desolated Earth.
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>Then thus the gracious Goddess, nodding, said;
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>Depart, and with your vestments veil your head:
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>And stooping lowly down, with losen'd zones,
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>Throw each behind your backs, your mighty mother's 
<A NAME="538"></A>bones.
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>Amaz'd the pair, and mute with wonder stand,
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>'Till Pyrrha first refus'd the dire command.
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>Forbid it Heav'n, said she, that I shou'd tear
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>Those holy reliques from the sepulcher.
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>They ponder'd the mysterious words again,
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>For some new sense; and long they sought in vain:
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>At length Deucalion clear'd his cloudy brow,
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>And said, the dark Aenigma will allow
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>A meaning, which, if well I understand,
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>From sacrilege will free the God's command:
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>This Earth our mighty mother is, the stones
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>In her capacious body, are her bones:
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>These we must cast behind. With hope, and fear,
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>The woman did the new solution hear:
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>The man diffides in his own augury,
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>And doubts the Gods; yet both resolve to try.
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>Descending from the mount, they first unbind
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>Their vests, and veil'd, they cast the stones behind:
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>The stones (a miracle to mortal view,
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>But long tradition makes it pass for true)
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>Did first the rigour of their kind expel,
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>And suppled into softness, as they fell;
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>Then swell'd, and swelling, by degrees grew warm;
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>And took the rudiments of human form.
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>Imperfect shapes: in marble such are seen,
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>When the rude chizzel does the man begin;
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>While yet the roughness of the stone remains,
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>Without the rising muscles, and the veins.
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>The sappy parts, and next resembling juice,
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>Were turn'd to moisture, for the body's use:
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>Supplying humours, blood, and nourishment;
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>The rest, too solid to receive a bent,
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>Converts to bones; and what was once a vein,
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>Its former name and Nature did retain.
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>By help of pow'r divine, in little space,
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>What the man threw, assum'd a manly face;
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>And what the wife, renew'd the female race.
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>Hence we derive our nature; born to bear
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>Laborious life; and harden'd into care.
<A NAME="578"></A><BR><BR>The rest of animals, from teeming Earth
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>Produc'd, in various forms receiv'd their birth.
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>The native moisture, in its close retreat,
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>Digested by the sun's aetherial heat,
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>As in a kindly womb, began to breed:
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>Then swell'd, and quicken'd by the vital seed.
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>And some in less, and some in longer space,
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>Were ripen'd into form, and took a sev'ral face.
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>Thus when the Nile from Pharian fields is fled,
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>And seeks, with ebbing tides, his ancient bed,
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>The fat manure with heav'nly fire is warm'd;
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>And crusted creatures, as in wombs, are form'd;
<A NAME="590"></A><BR>These, when they turn the glebe, the peasants find;
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>Some rude, and yet unfinish'd in their kind:
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>Short of their limbs, a lame imperfect birth:
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>One half alive; and one of lifeless earth.
<A NAME="594"></A><BR><BR>For heat, and moisture, when in bodies join'd,
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>The temper that results from either kind
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>Conception makes; and fighting 'till they mix,
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>Their mingled atoms in each other fix.
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>Thus Nature's hand the genial bed prepares
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>With friendly discord, and with fruitful wars.
<A NAME="600"></A><BR><BR>From hence the surface of the ground, with mud
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>And slime besmear'd (the faeces of the flood),
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>Receiv'd the rays of Heav'n: and sucking in
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>The seeds of heat, new creatures did begin:
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>Some were of sev'ral sorts produc'd before,
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>But of new monsters, Earth created more.
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>Unwillingly, but yet she brought to light
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>Thee, Python too, the wondring world to fright,
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>And the new nations, with so dire a sight:
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>So monstrous was his bulk, so large a space
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>Did his vast body, and long train embrace.
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>Whom Phoebus basking on a bank espy'd;
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>E're now the God his arrows had not try'd
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>But on the trembling deer, or mountain goat;
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>At this new quarry he prepares to shoot.
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>Though ev'ry shaft took place, he spent the store
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>Of his full quiver; and 'twas long before
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>Th' expiring serpent wallow'd in his gore.
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>Then, to preserve the fame of such a deed,
<A NAME="619"></A><BR>For Python slain, he Pythian games decred.
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>Where noble youths for mastership shou'd strive,
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>To quoit, to run, and steeds, and chariots drive.
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>The prize was fame: in witness of renown
<A NAME="623"></A><BR>An oaken garland did the victor crown.
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>The laurel was not yet for triumphs born;
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>But every green alike by Phoebus worn,
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>Did, with promiscuous grace, his flowing locks adorn.
<A NAME="627"></A><BR><BR><B>The Transformation of Daphne into a Lawrel</B>
<A NAME="628"></A><BR><BR>The first and fairest of his loves, was she
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>Whom not blind fortune, but the dire decree
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>Of angry Cupid forc'd him to desire:
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>Daphne her name, and Peneus was her sire.
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>Swell'd with the pride, that new success attends,
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>He sees the stripling, while his bow he bends,
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>And thus insults him: Thou lascivious boy,
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>Are arms like these for children to employ?
<A NAME="636"></A><BR>Know, such atchievements are my proper claim;
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>Due to my vigour, and unerring aim:
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>Resistless are my shafts, and Python late
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>In such a feather'd death, has found his fate.
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>Take up the torch (and lay my weapons by),
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>With that the feeble souls of lovers fry.
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>To whom the son of Venus thus reply'd,
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>Phoebus, thy shafts are sure on all beside,
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>But mine of Phoebus, mine the fame shall be
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>Of all thy conquests, when I conquer thee.
<A NAME="646"></A><BR><BR>He said, and soaring, swiftly wing'd his flight:
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>Nor stopt but on Parnassus' airy height.
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>Two diff'rent shafts he from his quiver draws;
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>One to repel desire, and one to cause.
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>One shaft is pointed with refulgent gold:
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>To bribe the love, and make the lover bold:
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>One blunt, and tipt with lead, whose base allay
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>Provokes disdain, and drives desire away.
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>The blunted bolt against the nymph he drest:
<A NAME="655"></A><BR>But with the sharp transfixt Apollo's breast.
<A NAME="656"></A><BR><BR>Th' enamour'd deity pursues the chace;
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>The scornful damsel shuns his loath'd embrace:
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>In hunting beasts of prey, her youth employs;
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>And Phoebe rivals in her rural joys.
<A NAME="660"></A><BR>With naked neck she goes, and shoulders bare;
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>And with a fillet binds her flowing hair.
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>By many suitors sought, she mocks their pains,
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>And still her vow'd virginity maintains.
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>Impatient of a yoke, the name of bride
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>She shuns, and hates the joys, she never try'd.
<A NAME="666"></A><BR>On wilds, and woods, she fixes her desire:
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>Nor knows what youth, and kindly love, inspire.
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>Her father chides her oft: Thou ow'st, says he,
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>A husband to thy self, a son to me.
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>She, like a crime, abhors the nuptial bed:
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>She glows with blushes, and she hangs her head.
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>Then casting round his neck her tender arms,
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>Sooths him with blandishments, and filial charms:
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>Give me, my Lord, she said, to live, and die,
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>A spotless maid, without the marriage tye.
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>'Tis but a small request; I beg no more
<A NAME="677"></A><BR>Than what Diana's father gave before.
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>The good old sire was soften'd to consent;
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>But said her wish wou'd prove her punishment:
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>For so much youth, and so much beauty join'd,
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>Oppos'd the state, which her desires design'd.
<A NAME="682"></A><BR><BR>The God of light, aspiring to her bed,
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>Hopes what he seeks, with flattering fancies fed;
<A NAME="684"></A><BR>And is, by his own oracles, mis-led.
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>And as in empty fields the stubble burns,
<A NAME="686"></A><BR>Or nightly travellers, when day returns,
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>Their useless torches on dry hedges throw,
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>That catch the flames, and kindle all the row;
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>So burns the God, consuming in desire,
<A NAME="690"></A><BR>And feeding in his breast a fruitless fire:
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>Her well-turn'd neck he view'd (her neck was bare)
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>And on her shoulders her dishevel'd hair;
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>Oh were it comb'd, said he, with what a grace
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>Wou'd every waving curl become her face!
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>He view'd her eyes, like heav'nly lamps that shone,
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>He view'd her lips, too sweet to view alone,
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>Her taper fingers, and her panting breast;
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>He praises all he sees, and for the rest
<A NAME="699"></A><BR>Believes the beauties yet unseen are best:
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>Swift as the wind, the damsel fled away,
<A NAME="701"></A><BR>Nor did for these alluring speeches stay:
<A NAME="702"></A><BR>Stay Nymph, he cry'd, I follow, not a foe.
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>Thus from the lyon trips the trembling doe;
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>Thus from the wolf the frighten'd lamb removes,
<A NAME="705"></A><BR>And, from pursuing faulcons, fearful doves;
<A NAME="706"></A><BR>Thou shunn'st a God, and shunn'st a God, that loves.
<A NAME="707"></A><BR>Ah, lest some thorn shou'd pierce thy tender foot,
<A NAME="708"></A><BR>Or thou shou'dst fall in flying my pursuit!
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>To sharp uneven ways thy steps decline;
<A NAME="710"></A><BR>Abate thy speed, and I will bate of mine.
<A NAME="711"></A><BR>Yet think from whom thou dost so rashly fly;
<A NAME="712"></A><BR>Nor basely born, nor shepherd's swain am I.
<A NAME="713"></A><BR>Perhaps thou know'st not my superior state;
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>And from that ignorance proceeds thy hate.
<A NAME="715"></A><BR>Me Claros, Delphi, Tenedos obey;
<A NAME="716"></A><BR>These hands the Patareian scepter sway.
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>The King of Gods begot me: what shall be,
<A NAME="718"></A><BR>Or is, or ever was, in Fate, I see.
<A NAME="719"></A><BR>Mine is th' invention of the charming lyre;
<A NAME="720"></A><BR>Sweet notes, and heav'nly numbers, I inspire.
<A NAME="721"></A><BR>Sure is my bow, unerring is my dart;
<A NAME="722"></A><BR>But ah! more deadly his, who pierc'd my heart.
<A NAME="723"></A><BR>Med'cine is mine; what herbs and simples grow
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>In fields, and forrests, all their pow'rs I know;
<A NAME="725"></A><BR>And am the great physician call'd, below.
<A NAME="726"></A><BR>Alas that fields and forrests can afford.
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>No remedies to heal their love-sick lord!
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>To cure the pains of love, no plant avails:
<A NAME="729"></A><BR>And his own physick, the physician falls.
<A NAME="730"></A><BR><BR>She heard not half; so furiously she flies;
<A NAME="731"></A><BR>And on her ear th' imperfect accent dies,
<A NAME="732"></A><BR>Fear gave her wings; and as she fled, the wind
<A NAME="733"></A><BR>Increasing, spread her flowing hair behind;
<A NAME="734"></A><BR>And left her legs and thighs expos'd to view:
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>Which made the God more eager to pursue.
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>The God was young, and was too hotly bent
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>To lose his time in empty compliment:
<A NAME="738"></A><BR>But led by love, and fir'd with such a sight,
<A NAME="739"></A><BR>Impetuously pursu'd his near delight.
<A NAME="740"></A><BR><BR>As when th' impatient greyhound slipt from far,
<A NAME="741"></A><BR>Bounds o'er the glebe to course the fearful hare,
<A NAME="742"></A><BR>She in her speed does all her safety lay;
<A NAME="743"></A><BR>And he with double speed pursues the prey;
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>O'er-runs her at the sitting turn, and licks
<A NAME="745"></A><BR>His chaps in vain, and blows upon the flix:
<A NAME="746"></A><BR>She scapes, and for the neighb'ring covert strives,
<A NAME="747"></A><BR>And gaining shelter, doubts if yet she lives:
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>If little things with great we may compare,
<A NAME="749"></A><BR>Such was the God, and such the flying fair,
<A NAME="750"></A><BR>She urg'd by fear, her feet did swiftly move,
<A NAME="751"></A><BR>But he more swiftly, who was urg'd by love.
<A NAME="752"></A><BR>He gathers ground upon her in the chace:
<A NAME="753"></A><BR>Now breathes upon her hair, with nearer pace;
<A NAME="754"></A><BR>And just is fast'ning on the wish'd embrace.
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>The nymph grew pale, and in a mortal fright,
<A NAME="756"></A><BR>Spent with the labour of so long a flight;
<A NAME="757"></A><BR>And now despairing, cast a mournful look
<A NAME="758"></A><BR>Upon the streams of her paternal brook;
<A NAME="759"></A><BR>Oh help, she cry'd, in this extreamest need!
<A NAME="760"></A><BR>If water Gods are deities indeed:
<A NAME="761"></A><BR>Gape Earth, and this unhappy wretch intomb;
<A NAME="762"></A><BR>Or change my form, whence all my sorrows come.
<A NAME="763"></A><BR>Scarce had she finish'd, when her feet she found
<A NAME="764"></A><BR>Benumb'd with cold, and fasten'd to the ground:
<A NAME="765"></A><BR>A filmy rind about her body grows;
<A NAME="766"></A><BR>Her hair to leaves, her arms extend to boughs:
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>The nymph is all into a lawrel gone;
<A NAME="768"></A><BR>The smoothness of her skin remains alone.
<A NAME="769"></A><BR>Yet Phoebus loves her still, and casting round
<A NAME="770"></A><BR>Her bole, his arms, some little warmth he found.
<A NAME="771"></A><BR>The tree still panted in th' unfinish'd part:
<A NAME="772"></A><BR>Not wholly vegetive, and heav'd her heart.
<A NAME="773"></A><BR>He fixt his lips upon the trembling rind;
<A NAME="774"></A><BR>It swerv'd aside, and his embrace declin'd.
<A NAME="775"></A><BR>To whom the God, Because thou canst not be
<A NAME="776"></A><BR>My mistress, I espouse thee for my tree:
<A NAME="777"></A><BR>Be thou the prize of honour, and renown;
<A NAME="778"></A><BR>The deathless poet, and the poem, crown.
<A NAME="779"></A><BR>Thou shalt the Roman festivals adorn,
<A NAME="780"></A><BR>And, after poets, be by victors worn.
<A NAME="781"></A><BR>Thou shalt returning Caesar's triumph grace;
<A NAME="782"></A><BR>When pomps shall in a long procession pass.
<A NAME="783"></A><BR>Wreath'd on the posts before his palace wait;
<A NAME="784"></A><BR>And be the sacred guardian of the gate.
<A NAME="785"></A><BR>Secure from thunder, and unharm'd by Jove,
<A NAME="786"></A><BR>Unfading as th' immortal Pow'rs above:
<A NAME="787"></A><BR>And as the locks of Phoebus are unshorn,
<A NAME="788"></A><BR>So shall perpetual green thy boughs adorn.
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>The grateful tree was pleas'd with what he said;
<A NAME="790"></A><BR>And shook the shady honours of her head.
<A NAME="791"></A><BR><BR><B>The Transformation of Io into a Heyfer</B>
<A NAME="792"></A><BR><BR>An ancient forest in Thessalia grows;
<A NAME="793"></A><BR>Which Tempe's pleasing valley does inclose:
<A NAME="794"></A><BR>Through this the rapid Peneus take his course;
<A NAME="795"></A><BR>From Pindus rolling with impetuous force;
<A NAME="796"></A><BR>Mists from the river's mighty fall arise:
<A NAME="797"></A><BR>And deadly damps inclose the cloudy skies:
<A NAME="798"></A><BR>Perpetual fogs are hanging o'er the wood;
<A NAME="799"></A><BR>And sounds of waters deaf the neighbourhood.
<A NAME="800"></A><BR>Deep, in a rocky cave, he makes abode
<A NAME="801"></A><BR>(A mansion proper for a mourning God).
<A NAME="802"></A><BR>Here he gives audience; issuing out decrees
<A NAME="803"></A><BR>To rivers, his dependant deities.
<A NAME="804"></A><BR>On this occasion hither they resort;
<A NAME="805"></A><BR>To pay their homage, and to make their court.
<A NAME="806"></A><BR>All doubtful, whether to congratulate
<A NAME="807"></A><BR>His daughter's honour, or lament her fate.
<A NAME="808"></A><BR>Sperchaeus, crown'd with poplar, first appears;
<A NAME="809"></A><BR>Then old Apidanus came crown'd with years:
<A NAME="810"></A><BR>Enipeus turbulent, Amphrysos tame;
<A NAME="811"></A><BR>And Aeas last with lagging waters came.
<A NAME="812"></A><BR>Then, of his kindred brooks, a num'rous throng
<A NAME="813"></A><BR>Condole his loss; and bring their urns along.
<A NAME="814"></A><BR>Not one was wanting of the wat'ry train,
<A NAME="815"></A><BR>That fill'd his flood, or mingled with the main:
<A NAME="816"></A><BR>But Inachus, who in his cave, alone,
<A NAME="817"></A><BR>Wept not another's losses, but his own,
<A NAME="818"></A><BR>For his dear Io, whether stray'd, or dead,
<A NAME="819"></A><BR>To him uncertain, doubtful tears he shed.
<A NAME="820"></A><BR>He sought her through the world; but sought in vain;
<A NAME="821"></A><BR>And no where finding, rather fear'd her slain.
<A NAME="822"></A><BR><BR>Her, just returning from her father's brook,
<A NAME="823"></A><BR>Jove had beheld, with a desiring look:
<A NAME="824"></A><BR>And, Oh fair daughter of the flood, he said,
<A NAME="825"></A><BR>Worthy alone of Jove's imperial bed,
<A NAME="826"></A><BR>Happy whoever shall those charms possess;
<A NAME="827"></A><BR>The king of Gods (nor is thy lover less)
<A NAME="828"></A><BR>Invites thee to yon cooler shades; to shun
<A NAME="829"></A><BR>The scorching rays of the meridian sun.
<A NAME="830"></A><BR>Nor shalt thou tempt the dangers of the grove
<A NAME="831"></A><BR>Alone, without a guide; thy guide is Jove.
<A NAME="832"></A><BR>No puny Pow'r, but he whose high command
<A NAME="833"></A><BR>Is unconfin'd, who rules the seas and land;
<A NAME="834"></A><BR>And tempers thunder in his awful hand,
<A NAME="835"></A><BR>Oh fly not: for she fled from his embrace
<A NAME="836"></A><BR>O'er Lerna's pastures: he pursu'd the chace
<A NAME="837"></A><BR>Along the shades of the Lyrcaean plain;
<A NAME="838"></A><BR>At length the God, who never asks in vain,
<A NAME="839"></A><BR>Involv'd with vapours, imitating night,
<A NAME="840"></A><BR>Both Air, and Earth; and then suppress'd her flight,
<A NAME="841"></A><BR>And mingling force with love, enjoy'd the full delight.
<A NAME="842"></A><BR>Mean-time the jealous Juno, from on high,
<A NAME="843"></A><BR>Survey'd the fruitful fields of Arcady;
<A NAME="844"></A><BR>And wonder'd that the mist shou'd over-run
<A NAME="845"></A><BR>The face of day-light, and obscure the sun.
<A NAME="846"></A><BR>No nat'ral cause she found, from brooks, or bogs,
<A NAME="847"></A><BR>Or marshy lowlands, to produce the fogs;
<A NAME="848"></A><BR>Then round the skies she sought for Jupiter,
<A NAME="849"></A><BR>Her faithless husband; but no Jove was there:
<A NAME="850"></A><BR>Suspecting now the worst, Or I, she said,
<A NAME="851"></A><BR>Am much mistaken, or am much betray'd.
<A NAME="852"></A><BR>With fury she precipitates her flight:
<A NAME="853"></A><BR>Dispels the shadows of dissembled night;
<A NAME="854"></A><BR>And to the day restores his native light.
<A NAME="855"></A><BR>Th' Almighty Leacher, careful to prevent
<A NAME="856"></A><BR>The consequence, foreseeing her descent,
<A NAME="857"></A><BR>Transforms his mistress in a trice; and now
<A NAME="858"></A><BR>In Io's place appears a lovely cow.
<A NAME="859"></A><BR>So sleek her skin, so faultless was her make,
<A NAME="860"></A><BR>Ev'n Juno did unwilling pleasure take
<A NAME="861"></A><BR>To see so fair a rival of her love;
<A NAME="862"></A><BR>And what she was, and whence, enquir'd of Jove:
<A NAME="863"></A><BR>Of what fair herd, and from what pedigree?
<A NAME="864"></A><BR>The God, half caught, was forc'd upon a lye:
<A NAME="865"></A><BR>And said she sprung from Earth. She took the word,
<A NAME="866"></A><BR>And begg'd the beauteous heyfer of her lord.
<A NAME="867"></A><BR>What should he do? 'twas equal shame to Jove
<A NAME="868"></A><BR>Or to relinquish, or betray his love:
<A NAME="869"></A><BR>Yet to refuse so slight a gift, wou'd be
<A NAME="870"></A><BR>But more t' increase his consort's jealousie:
<A NAME="871"></A><BR>Thus fear, and love, by turns, his heart assail'd;
<A NAME="872"></A><BR>And stronger love had sure, at length, prevail'd:
<A NAME="873"></A><BR>But some faint hope remain'd, his jealous queen
<A NAME="874"></A><BR>Had not the mistress through the heyfer seen.
<A NAME="875"></A><BR>The cautious Goddess, of her gift possest,
<A NAME="876"></A><BR>Yet harbour'd anxious thoughts within her breast;
<A NAME="877"></A><BR>As she who knew the falshood of her Jove;
<A NAME="878"></A><BR>And justly fear'd some new relapse of love.
<A NAME="879"></A><BR>Which to prevent, and to secure her care,
<A NAME="880"></A><BR>To trusty Argus she commits the fair.
<A NAME="881"></A><BR><BR>The head of Argus (as with stars the skies)
<A NAME="882"></A><BR>Was compass'd round, and wore an hundred eyes.
<A NAME="883"></A><BR>But two by turns their lids in slumber steep;
<A NAME="884"></A><BR>The rest on duty still their station keep;
<A NAME="885"></A><BR>Nor cou'd the total constellation sleep.
<A NAME="886"></A><BR>Thus, ever present, to his eyes, and mind,
<A NAME="887"></A><BR>His charge was still before him, tho' behind.
<A NAME="888"></A><BR>In fields he suffer'd her to feed by Day,
<A NAME="889"></A><BR>But when the setting sun to night gave way,
<A NAME="890"></A><BR>The captive cow he summon'd with a call;
<A NAME="891"></A><BR>And drove her back, and ty'd her to the stall.
<A NAME="892"></A><BR>On leaves of trees, and bitter herbs she fed,
<A NAME="893"></A><BR>Heav'n was her canopy, bare earth her bed:
<A NAME="894"></A><BR>So hardly lodg'd, and to digest her food,
<A NAME="895"></A><BR>She drank from troubled streams, defil'd with mud.
<A NAME="896"></A><BR>Her woeful story fain she wou'd have told,
<A NAME="897"></A><BR>With hands upheld, but had no hands to hold.
<A NAME="898"></A><BR>Her head to her ungentle keeper bow'd,
<A NAME="899"></A><BR>She strove to speak, she spoke not, but she low'd:
<A NAME="900"></A><BR>Affrighted with the noise, she look'd around,
<A NAME="901"></A><BR>And seem'd t' inquire the author of the sound.
<A NAME="902"></A><BR><BR>Once on the banks where often she had play'd
<A NAME="903"></A><BR>(Her father's banks), she came, and there survey'd
<A NAME="904"></A><BR>Her alter'd visage, and her branching head;
<A NAME="905"></A><BR>And starting, from her self she wou'd have fled.
<A NAME="906"></A><BR>Her fellow nymphs, familiar to her eyes,
<A NAME="907"></A><BR>Beheld, but knew her not in this disguise.
<A NAME="908"></A><BR>Ev'n Inachus himself was ignorant;
<A NAME="909"></A><BR>And in his daughter, did his daughter want.
<A NAME="910"></A><BR>She follow'd where her fellows went, as she
<A NAME="911"></A><BR>Were still a partner of the company:
<A NAME="912"></A><BR>They stroak her neck; the gentle heyfer stands,
<A NAME="913"></A><BR>And her neck offers to their stroaking hands.
<A NAME="914"></A><BR>Her father gave her grass; the grass she took;
<A NAME="915"></A><BR>And lick'd his palms, and cast a piteous look;
<A NAME="916"></A><BR>And in the language of her eyes, she spoke.
<A NAME="917"></A><BR>She wou'd have told her name, and ask'd relief,
<A NAME="918"></A><BR>But wanting words, in tears she tells her grief.
<A NAME="919"></A><BR>Which, with her foot she makes him understand;
<A NAME="920"></A><BR>And prints the name of Io in the sand.
<A NAME="921"></A><BR><BR>Ah wretched me! her mournful father cry'd;
<A NAME="922"></A><BR>She, with a sigh, to wretched me reply'd:
<A NAME="923"></A><BR>About her milk-white neck, his arms he threw;
<A NAME="924"></A><BR>And wept, and then these tender words ensue.
<A NAME="925"></A><BR>And art thou she, whom I have sought around
<A NAME="926"></A><BR>The world, and have at length so sadly found?
<A NAME="927"></A><BR>So found, is worse than lost: with mutual words
<A NAME="928"></A><BR>Thou answer'st not, no voice thy tongue affords:
<A NAME="929"></A><BR>But sighs are deeply drawn from out thy breast;
<A NAME="930"></A><BR>And speech deny'd, by lowing is express'd.
<A NAME="931"></A><BR>Unknowing, I prepar'd thy bridal bed;
<A NAME="932"></A><BR>With empty hopes of happy issue fed.
<A NAME="933"></A><BR>But now the husband of a herd must be
<A NAME="934"></A><BR>Thy mate, and bell'wing sons thy progeny.
<A NAME="935"></A><BR>Oh, were I mortal, death might bring relief:
<A NAME="936"></A><BR>But now my God-head but extends my grief:
<A NAME="937"></A><BR>Prolongs my woes, of which no end I see,
<A NAME="938"></A><BR>And makes me curse my immortality!
<A NAME="939"></A><BR>More had he said, but fearful of her stay,
<A NAME="940"></A><BR>The starry guardian drove his charge away,
<A NAME="941"></A><BR>To some fresh pasture; on a hilly height
<A NAME="942"></A><BR>He sate himself, and kept her still in sight.
<A NAME="943"></A><BR><BR>The Eyes of Argus transform'd into a Peacock's 
<A NAME="944"></A>Train
<A NAME="945"></A><BR><BR>Now Jove no longer cou'd her suff'rings bear;
<A NAME="946"></A><BR>But call'd in haste his airy messenger,
<A NAME="947"></A><BR>The son of Maia, with severe decree
<A NAME="948"></A><BR>To kill the keeper, and to set her free.
<A NAME="949"></A><BR>With all his harness soon the God was sped,
<A NAME="950"></A><BR>His flying hat was fastned on his head,
<A NAME="951"></A><BR>Wings on his heels were hung, and in his hand
<A NAME="952"></A><BR>He holds the vertue of the snaky wand.
<A NAME="953"></A><BR>The liquid air his moving pinions wound,
<A NAME="954"></A><BR>And, in the moment, shoot him on the ground.
<A NAME="955"></A><BR>Before he came in sight, the crafty God
<A NAME="956"></A><BR>His wings dismiss'd, but still retain'd his rod:
<A NAME="957"></A><BR>That sleep-procuring wand wise Hermes took,
<A NAME="958"></A><BR>But made it seem to sight a sherpherd's hook.
<A NAME="959"></A><BR>With this, he did a herd of goats controul;
<A NAME="960"></A><BR>Which by the way he met, and slily stole.
<A NAME="961"></A><BR>Clad like a country swain, he pip'd, and sung;
<A NAME="962"></A><BR>And playing, drove his jolly troop along.
<A NAME="963"></A><BR><BR>With pleasure, Argus the musician heeds;
<A NAME="964"></A><BR>But wonders much at those new vocal reeds.
<A NAME="965"></A><BR>And whosoe'er thou art, my friend, said he,
<A NAME="966"></A><BR>Up hither drive thy goats, and play by me:
<A NAME="967"></A><BR>This hill has browz for them, and shade for thee.
<A NAME="968"></A><BR>The God, who was with ease induc'd to climb,
<A NAME="969"></A><BR>Began discourse to pass away the time;
<A NAME="970"></A><BR>And still betwixt, his tuneful pipe he plies;
<A NAME="971"></A><BR>And watch'd his hour, to close the keeper's eyes.
<A NAME="972"></A><BR>With much ado, he partly kept awake;
<A NAME="973"></A><BR>Not suff'ring all his eyes repose to take:
<A NAME="974"></A><BR>And ask'd the stranger, who did reeds invent,
<A NAME="975"></A><BR>And whence began so rare an instrument?
<A NAME="976"></A><BR><BR><B>The Transformation of Syrinx into Reeds</B>
<A NAME="977"></A><BR><BR>Then Hermes thus: A nymph of late there was
<A NAME="978"></A><BR>Whose heav'nly form her fellows did surpass.
<A NAME="979"></A><BR>The pride and joy of fair Arcadia's plains,
<A NAME="980"></A><BR>Belov'd by deities, ador'd by swains:
<A NAME="981"></A><BR>Syrinx her name, by Sylvans oft pursu'd,
<A NAME="982"></A><BR>As oft she did the lustful Gods delude:
<A NAME="983"></A><BR>The rural, and the woodland Pow'rs disdain'd;
<A NAME="984"></A><BR>With Cynthia hunted, and her rites maintain'd:
<A NAME="985"></A><BR>Like Phoebe clad, even Phoebe's self she seems,
<A NAME="986"></A><BR>So tall, so streight, such well-proportion'd limbs:
<A NAME="987"></A><BR>The nicest eye did no distinction know,
<A NAME="988"></A><BR>But that the goddess bore a golden bow:
<A NAME="989"></A><BR>Distinguish'd thus, the sight she cheated too.
<A NAME="990"></A><BR>Descending from Lycaeus, Pan admires
<A NAME="991"></A><BR>The matchless nymph, and burns with new desires.
<A NAME="992"></A><BR>A crown of pine upon his head he wore;
<A NAME="993"></A><BR>And thus began her pity to implore.
<A NAME="994"></A><BR>But e'er he thus began, she took her flight
<A NAME="995"></A><BR>So swift, she was already out of sight.
<A NAME="996"></A><BR>Nor stay'd to hear the courtship of the God;
<A NAME="997"></A><BR>But bent her course to Ladon's gentle flood:
<A NAME="998"></A><BR>There by the river stopt, and tir'd before;
<A NAME="999"></A><BR>Relief from water nymphs her pray'rs implore.
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR><BR>Now while the lustful God, with speedy pace,
<A NAME="1001"></A><BR>Just thought to strain her in a strict embrace,
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR>He fill'd his arms with reeds, new rising on the 
<A NAME="1003"></A>place.
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR>And while he sighs, his ill success to find,
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR>The tender canes were shaken by the wind;
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR>And breath'd a mournful air, unheard before;
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR>That much surprizing Pan, yet pleas'd him more.
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR>Admiring this new musick, Thou, he said,
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR>Who canst not be the partner of my bed,
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR>At least shall be the confort of my mind:
<A NAME="1011"></A><BR>And often, often to my lips be joyn'd.
<A NAME="1012"></A><BR>He form'd the reeds, proportion'd as they are,
<A NAME="1013"></A><BR>Unequal in their length, and wax'd with care,
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR>They still retain the name of his ungrateful fair.
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR><BR>While Hermes pip'd, and sung, and told his tale,
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR>The keeper's winking eyes began to fail,
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR>And drowsie slumber on the lids to creep;
<A NAME="1018"></A><BR>'Till all the watchman was at length asleep.
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR>Then soon the God his voice, and song supprest;
<A NAME="1020"></A><BR>And with his pow'rful rod confirm'd his rest:
<A NAME="1021"></A><BR>Without delay his crooked faulchion drew,
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR>And at one fatal stroke the keeper slew.
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR>Down from the rock fell the dissever'd head,
<A NAME="1024"></A><BR>Opening its eyes in death; and falling, bled;
<A NAME="1025"></A><BR>And mark'd the passage with a crimson trail:
<A NAME="1026"></A><BR>Thus Argus lies in pieces, cold, and pale;
<A NAME="1027"></A><BR>And all his hundred eyes, with all their light,
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR>Are clos'd at once, in one perpetual night.
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR>These Juno takes, that they no more may fail,
<A NAME="1030"></A><BR>And spreads them in her peacock's gaudy tail.
<A NAME="1031"></A><BR><BR>Impatient to revenge her injur'd bed,
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR>She wreaks her anger on her rival's head;
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR>With Furies frights her from her native home;
<A NAME="1034"></A><BR>And drives her gadding, round the world to roam:
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR>Nor ceas'd her madness, and her flight, before
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR>She touch'd the limits of the Pharian shore.
<A NAME="1037"></A><BR>At length, arriving on the banks of Nile,
<A NAME="1038"></A><BR>Wearied with length of ways, and worn with toil,
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR>She laid her down; and leaning on her knees,
<A NAME="1040"></A><BR>Invok'd the cause of all her miseries:
<A NAME="1041"></A><BR>And cast her languishing regards above,
<A NAME="1042"></A><BR>For help from Heav'n, and her ungrateful Jove.
<A NAME="1043"></A><BR>She sigh'd, she wept, she low'd; 'twas all she cou'd;
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR>And with unkindness seem'd to tax the God.
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR>Last, with an humble pray'r, she beg'd repose,
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR>Or death at least, to finish all her woes.
<A NAME="1047"></A><BR>Jove heard her vows, and with a flatt'ring look,
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR>In her behalf to jealous Juno spoke,
<A NAME="1049"></A><BR>He cast his arms about her neck, and said,
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR>Dame, rest secure; no more thy nuptial bed
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR>This nymph shall violate; by Styx I swear,
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR>And every oath that binds the Thunderer.
<A NAME="1053"></A><BR>The Goddess was appeas'd; and at the word
<A NAME="1054"></A><BR>Was Io to her former shape restor'd.
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR>The rugged hair began to fall away;
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR>The sweetness of her eyes did only stay,
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR>Tho' not so large; her crooked horns decrease;
<A NAME="1058"></A><BR>The wideness of her jaws and nostrils cease:
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR>Her hoofs to hands return, in little space:
<A NAME="1060"></A><BR>The five long taper fingers take their place,
<A NAME="1061"></A><BR>And nothing of the heyfer now is seen,
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR>Beside the native whiteness of the skin.
<A NAME="1063"></A><BR>Erected on her feet she walks again:
<A NAME="1064"></A><BR>And two the duty of the four sustain.
<A NAME="1065"></A><BR>She tries her tongue; her silence softly breaks,
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR>And fears her former lowings when she speaks:
<A NAME="1067"></A><BR>A Goddess now, through all th' Aegyptian State:
<A NAME="1068"></A><BR>And serv'd by priests, who in white linnen wait.
<A NAME="1069"></A><BR><BR>Her son was Epaphus, at length believ'd
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR>The son of Jove, and as a God receiv'd;
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR>With sacrifice ador'd, and publick pray'rs,
<A NAME="1072"></A><BR>He common temples with his mother shares.
<A NAME="1073"></A><BR>Equal in years, and rival in renown
<A NAME="1074"></A><BR>With Epaphus, the youthful Phaeton
<A NAME="1075"></A><BR>Like honour claims; and boasts his sire the sun.
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR>His haughty looks, and his assuming air,
<A NAME="1077"></A><BR>The son of Isis could no longer bear:
<A NAME="1078"></A><BR>Thou tak'st thy mother's word too far, said he,
<A NAME="1079"></A><BR>And hast usurp'd thy boasted pedigree.
<A NAME="1080"></A><BR>Go, base pretender to a borrow'd name.
<A NAME="1081"></A><BR>Thus tax'd, he blush'd with anger, and with shame;
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR>But shame repress'd his rage: the daunted youth
<A NAME="1083"></A><BR>Soon seeks his mother, and enquires the truth:
<A NAME="1084"></A><BR>Mother, said he, this infamy was thrown
<A NAME="1085"></A><BR>By Epaphus on you, and me your son.
<A NAME="1086"></A><BR>He spoke in publick, told it to my face;
<A NAME="1087"></A><BR>Nor durst I vindicate the dire disgrace:
<A NAME="1088"></A><BR>Even I, the bold, the sensible of wrong,
<A NAME="1089"></A><BR>Restrain'd by shame, was forc'd to hold my tongue.
<A NAME="1090"></A><BR>To hear an open slander, is a curse:
<A NAME="1091"></A><BR>But not to find an answer, is a worse.
<A NAME="1092"></A><BR>If I am Heav'n-begot, assert your son
<A NAME="1093"></A><BR>By some sure sign; and make my father known,
<A NAME="1094"></A><BR>To right my honour, and redeem your own.
<A NAME="1095"></A><BR>He said, and saying cast his arms about
<A NAME="1096"></A><BR>Her neck, and beg'd her to resolve the doubt.
<A NAME="1097"></A><BR><BR>'Tis hard to judge if Clymene were mov'd
<A NAME="1098"></A><BR>More by his pray'r, whom she so dearly lov'd,
<A NAME="1099"></A><BR>Or more with fury fir'd, to find her name
<A NAME="1100"></A><BR>Traduc'd, and made the sport of common fame.
<A NAME="1101"></A><BR>She stretch'd her arms to Heav'n, and fix'd her 
<A NAME="1102"></A>eyes
<A NAME="1103"></A><BR>On that fair planet that adorns the skies;
<A NAME="1104"></A><BR>Now by those beams, said she, whose holy fires
<A NAME="1105"></A><BR>Consume my breast, and kindle my desires;
<A NAME="1106"></A><BR>By him, who sees us both, and clears our sight,
<A NAME="1107"></A><BR>By him, the publick minister of light,
<A NAME="1108"></A><BR>I swear that Sun begot thee; if I lye,
<A NAME="1109"></A><BR>Let him his chearful influence deny:
<A NAME="1110"></A><BR>Let him no more this perjur'd creature see;
<A NAME="1111"></A><BR>And shine on all the world but only me.
<A NAME="1112"></A><BR>If still you doubt your mother's innocence,
<A NAME="1113"></A><BR>His eastern mansion is not far from hence;
<A NAME="1114"></A><BR>With little pains you to his Leve go,
<A NAME="1115"></A><BR>And from himself your parentage may know.
<A NAME="1116"></A><BR>With joy th' ambitious youth his mother heard,
<A NAME="1117"></A><BR>And eager, for the journey soon prepar'd.
<A NAME="1118"></A><BR>He longs the world beneath him to survey;
<A NAME="1119"></A><BR>To guide the chariot; and to give the day:
<A NAME="1120"></A><BR>From Meroe's burning sands he bends his course,
<A NAME="1121"></A><BR>Nor less in India feels his father's force:
<A NAME="1122"></A><BR>His travel urging, till he came in sight;
<A NAME="1123"></A><BR>And saw the palace by the purple light.
