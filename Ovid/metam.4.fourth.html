<A NAME="start"></A>
<A NAME="10"></A><B>The Story of Alcithoe and her Sisters</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>Yet still Alcithoe perverse remains,
<A NAME="12"></A><BR>And Bacchus still, and all his rites, disdains.
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>Too rash, and madly bold, she bids him prove
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>Himself a God, nor owns the son of Jove.
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>Her sisters too unanimous agree,
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>Faithful associates in impiety.
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>Be this a solemn feast, the priest had said;
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>Be, with each mistress, unemploy'd each maid.
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>With skins of beasts your tender limbs enclose,
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>And with an ivy-crown adorn your brows,
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>The leafy Thyrsus high in triumph bear,
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>And give your locks to wanton in the air.
<A NAME="23"></A><BR><BR>These rites profan'd, the holy seer foreshow'd
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>A mourning people, and a vengeful God.
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><BR>Matrons and pious wives obedience show,
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>Distaffs, and wooll, half spun, away they throw:
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>Then incense burn, and, Bacchus, thee adore,
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>Or lov'st thou Nyseus, or Lyaeus more?
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>O! doubly got, O! doubly born, they sung,
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>Thou mighty Bromius, hail, from light'ning sprung!
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>Hail, Thyon, Eleleus! each name is thine:
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>Or, listen parent of the genial vine!
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>Iachus! Evan! loudly they repeat,
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>And not one Grecian attribute forget,
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>Which to thy praise, great Deity, belong,
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>Stil'd justly Liber in the Roman song.
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>Eternity of youth is thine! enjoy
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>Years roul'd on years, yet still a blooming boy.
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>In Heav'n thou shin'st with a superior grace;
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>Conceal thy horns, and 'tis a virgin's face.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>Thou taught'st the tawny Indian to obey,
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>And Ganges, smoothly flowing, own'd thy sway.
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>Lycurgus, Pentheus, equally profane,
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>By thy just vengeance equally were slain.
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>By thee the Tuscans, who conspir'd to keep
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>Thee captive, plung'd, and cut with finns the deep.
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>With painted reins, all-glitt'ring from afar,
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>The spotted lynxes proudly draw thy car.
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>Around, the Bacchae, and the satyrs throng;
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>Behind, Silenus, drunk, lags slow along:
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>On his dull ass he nods from side to side,
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>Forbears to fall, yet half forgets to ride.
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>Still at thy near approach, applauses loud
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>Are heard, with yellings of the female crowd.
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>Timbrels, and boxen pipes, with mingled cries,
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>Swell up in sounds confus'd, and rend the skies.
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>Come, Bacchus, come propitious, all implore,
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>And act thy sacred orgies o'er and o'er.
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR>But Mineus' daughters, while these rites were 
<A NAME="60"></A>pay'd,
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>At home, impertinently busie, stay'd.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>Their wicked tasks they ply with various art,
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>And thro' the loom the sliding shuttle dart;
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>Or at the fire to comb the wooll they stand,
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>Or twirl the spindle with a dext'rous hand.
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>Guilty themselves, they force the guiltless in;
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>Their maids, who share the labour, share the sin.
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>At last one sister cries, who nimbly knew
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>To draw nice threads, and winde the finest clue,
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>While others idly rove, and Gods revere,
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>Their fancy'd Gods! they know not who, or where;
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>Let us, whom Pallas taught her better arts,
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>Still working, cheer with mirthful chat our hearts,
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>And to deceive the time, let me prevail
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>With each by turns to tell some antique tale.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>She said: her sisters lik'd the humour well,
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>And smiling, bad her the first story tell.
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>But she a-while profoundly seem'd to muse,
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>Perplex'd amid variety to chuse:
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>And knew not, whether she should first relate
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>The poor Dircetis, and her wond'rous fate.
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>The Palestines believe it to a man,
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>And show the lake, in which her scales began.
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>Or if she rather should the daughter sing,
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>Who in the hoary verge of life took wing;
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>Who soar'd from Earth, and dwelt in tow'rs on high,
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>And now a dove she flits along the sky.
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>Or how lewd Nais, when her lust was cloy'd,
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>To fishes turn'd the youths, she had enjoy'd,
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>By pow'rful verse, and herbs; effect most strange!
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>At last the changer shar'd herself the change.
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>Or how the tree, which once white berries bore,
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>Still crimson bears, since stain'd with crimson 
<A NAME="94"></A>gore.
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>The tree was new; she likes it, and begins
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>To tell the tale, and as she tells, she spins.
<A NAME="97"></A><BR><BR><B>The Story of Pyramus and Thisbe</B>
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR>In Babylon, where first her queen, for state
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>Rais'd walls of brick magnificently great,
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>Liv'd Pyramus, and Thisbe, lovely pair!
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>He found no eastern youth his equal there,
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>And she beyond the fairest nymph was fair.
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>A closer neighbourhood was never known,
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>Tho' two the houses, yet the roof was one.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>Acquaintance grew, th' acquaintance they improve
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>To friendship, friendship ripen'd into love:
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>Love had been crown'd, but impotently mad,
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>What parents could not hinder, they forbad.
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>For with fierce flames young Pyramus still burn'd,
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>And grateful Thisbe flames as fierce return'd.
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>Aloud in words their thoughts they dare not break,
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>But silent stand; and silent looks can speak.
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>The fire of love the more it is supprest,
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>The more it glows, and rages in the breast.
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR>When the division-wall was built, a chink
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>Was left, the cement unobserv'd to shrink.
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>So slight the cranny, that it still had been
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>For centuries unclos'd, because unseen.
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>But oh! what thing so small, so secret lies,
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>Which scapes, if form'd for love, a lover's eyes?
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>Ev'n in this narrow chink they quickly found
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>A friendly passage for a trackless sound.
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>Safely they told their sorrows, and their joys,
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>In whisper'd murmurs, and a dying noise,
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>By turns to catch each other's breath they strove,
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>And suck'd in all the balmy breeze of love.
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>Oft as on diff'rent sides they stood, they cry'd,
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>Malicious wall, thus lovers to divide!
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>Suppose, thou should'st a-while to us give place
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>To lock, and fasten in a close embrace:
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>But if too much to grant so sweet a bliss,
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>Indulge at least the pleasure of a kiss.
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>We scorn ingratitude: to thee, we know,
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>This safe conveyance of our minds we owe.
<A NAME="135"></A><BR><BR>Thus they their vain petition did renew
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>'Till night, and then they softly sigh'd adieu.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>But first they strove to kiss, and that was all;
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>Their kisses dy'd untasted on the wall.
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>Soon as the morn had o'er the stars prevail'd,
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>And warm'd by Phoebus, flow'rs their dews exhal'd,
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>The lovers to their well-known place return,
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>Alike they suffer, and alike they mourn.
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>At last their parents they resolve to cheat
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>(If to deceive in love be call'd deceit),
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>To steal by night from home, and thence unknown
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>To seek the fields, and quit th' unfaithful town.
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>But, to prevent their wand'ring in the dark,
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>They both agree to fix upon a mark;
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>A mark, that could not their designs expose:
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>The tomb of Ninus was the mark they chose.
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>There they might rest secure beneath the shade,
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>Which boughs, with snowy fruit encumber'd, made:
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>A wide-spread mulberry its rise had took
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>Just on the margin of a gurgling brook.
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>Impatient for the friendly dusk they stay;
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>And chide the slowness of departing day;
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>In western seas down sunk at last the light,
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>From western seas up-rose the shades of night.
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>The loving Thisbe ev'n prevents the hour,
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>With cautious silence she unlocks the door,
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>And veils her face, and marching thro' the gloom
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>Swiftly arrives at th' assignation-tomb.
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>For still the fearful sex can fearless prove;
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>Boldly they act, if spirited by love.
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>When lo! a lioness rush'd o'er the plain,
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>Grimly besmear'd with blood of oxen slain:
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>And what to the dire sight new horrors brought,
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>To slake her thirst the neighb'ring spring she sought.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>Which, by the moon, when trembling Thisbe spies,
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>Wing'd with her fear, swift, as the wind, she flies;
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>And in a cave recovers from her fright,
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>But drop'd her veil, confounded in her flight.
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>When sated with repeated draughts, again
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>The queen of beasts scour'd back along the plain,
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>She found the veil, and mouthing it all o'er,
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>With bloody jaws the lifeless prey she tore.
<A NAME="177"></A><BR><BR>The youth, who could not cheat his guards so 
<A NAME="178"></A>soon,
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>Late came, and noted by the glimm'ring moon
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>Some savage feet, new printed on the ground,
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>His cheeks turn'd pale, his limbs no vigour found;
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>But when, advancing on, the veil he spied
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>Distain'd with blood, and ghastly torn, he cried,
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>One night shall death to two young lovers give,
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>But she deserv'd unnumber'd years to live!
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>'Tis I am guilty, I have thee betray'd,
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>Who came not early, as my charming maid.
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>Whatever slew thee, I the cause remain,
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>I nam'd, and fix'd the place where thou wast slain.
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>Ye lions from your neighb'ring dens repair,
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>Pity the wretch, this impious body tear!
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>But cowards thus for death can idly cry;
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>The brave still have it in their pow'r to die.
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>Then to th' appointed tree he hastes away,
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>The veil first gather'd, tho' all rent it lay:
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>The veil all rent yet still it self endears,
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>He kist, and kissing, wash'd it with his tears.
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>Tho' rich (he cry'd) with many a precious stain,
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>Still from my blood a deeper tincture gain.
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>Then in his breast his shining sword he drown'd,
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>And fell supine, extended on the ground.
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>As out again the blade lie dying drew,
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>Out spun the blood, and streaming upwards flew.
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>So if a conduit-pipe e'er burst you saw,
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>Swift spring the gushing waters thro' the flaw:
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>Then spouting in a bow, they rise on high,
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>And a new fountain plays amid the sky.
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>The berries, stain'd with blood, began to show
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>A dark complexion, and forgot their snow;
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>While fatten'd with the flowing gore, the root
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>Was doom'd for ever to a purple fruit.
<A NAME="212"></A><BR><BR>Mean-time poor Thisbe fear'd, so long she stay'd,
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>Her lover might suspect a perjur'd maid.
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>Her fright scarce o'er, she strove the youth to 
<A NAME="215"></A>find
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>With ardent eyes, which spoke an ardent mind.
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>Already in his arms, she hears him sigh
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>At her destruction, which was once so nigh.
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>The tomb, the tree, but not the fruit she knew,
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>The fruit she doubted for its alter'd hue.
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>Still as she doubts, her eyes a body found
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>Quiv'ring in death, and gasping on the ground.
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>She started back, the red her cheeks forsook,
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>And ev'ry nerve with thrilling horrors shook.
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>So trembles the smooth surface of the seas,
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>If brush'd o'er gently with a rising breeze.
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>But when her view her bleeding love confest,
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>She shriek'd, she tore her hair, she beat her breast.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>She rais'd the body, and embrac'd it round,
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>And bath'd with tears unfeign'd the gaping wound.
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>Then her warm lips to the cold face apply'd,
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>And is it thus, ah! thus we meet, she cry'd!
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>My Pyramus! whence sprung thy cruel fate?
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>My Pyramus!- ah! speak, ere 'tis too late.
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>I, thy own Thisbe, but one word implore,
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>One word thy Thisbe never ask'd before.
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>At Thisbe's name, awak'd, he open'd wide
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>His dying eyes; with dying eyes he try'd
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>On her to dwell, but clos'd them slow, and dy'd.
<A NAME="240"></A><BR><BR>The fatal cause was now at last explor'd,
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>Her veil she knew, and saw his sheathless sword:
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>From thy own hand thy ruin thou hast found,
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>She said, but love first taught that hand to wound,
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>Ev'n I for thee as bold a hand can show,
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>And love, which shall as true direct the blow.
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>I will against the woman's weakness strive,
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>And never thee, lamented youth, survive.
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>The world may say, I caus'd, alas! thy death,
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>But saw thee breathless, and resign'd my breath.
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>Fate, tho' it conquers, shall no triumph gain,
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>Fate, that divides us, still divides in vain.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR>Now, both our cruel parents, hear my pray'r;
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>My pray'r to offer for us both I dare;
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>Oh! see our ashes in one urn confin'd,
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>Whom love at first, and fate at last has join'd.
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>The bliss, you envy'd, is not our request;
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>Lovers, when dead, may sure together rest.
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>Thou, tree, where now one lifeless lump is laid,
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>Ere-long o'er two shalt cast a friendly shade.
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>Still let our loves from thee be understood,
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>Still witness in thy purple fruit our blood.
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>She spoke, and in her bosom plung'd the sword,
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>All warm and reeking from its slaughter'd lord.
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>The pray'r, which dying Thisbe had preferr'd,
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>Both Gods, and parents, with compassion heard.
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>The whiteness of the mulberry soon fled,
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>And rip'ning, sadden'd in a dusky red:
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>While both their parents their lost children mourn,
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>And mix their ashes in one golden urn.
<A NAME="270"></A><BR><BR>Thus did the melancholy tale conclude,
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>And a short, silent interval ensu'd.
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>The next in birth unloos'd her artful tongue,
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>And drew attentive all the sister-throng.
<A NAME="274"></A><BR><BR><B>The Story of Leucothoe and the Sun</B>
<A NAME="275"></A><BR><BR>The Sun, the source of light, by beauty's pow'r
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>Once am'rous grew; then hear the Sun's amour.
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>Venus, and Mars, with his far-piercing eyes
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>This God first spy'd; this God first all things 
<A NAME="279"></A>spies.
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>Stung at the sight, and swift on mischief bent,
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>To haughty Juno's shapeless son he went:
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>The Goddess, and her God gallant betray'd,
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>And told the cuckold, where their pranks were play'd.
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>Poor Vulcan soon desir'd to hear no more,
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>He drop'd his hammer, and he shook all o'er:
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>Then courage takes, and full of vengeful ire
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>He heaves the bellows, and blows fierce the fire:
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>From liquid brass, tho' sure, yet subtile snares
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>He forms, and next a wond'rous net prepares,
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>Drawn with such curious art, so nicely sly,
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>Unseen the mashes cheat the searching eye.
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>Not half so thin their webs the spiders weave,
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>Which the most wary, buzzing prey deceive.
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>These chains, obedient to the touch, he spread
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>In secret foldings o'er the conscious bed:
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>The conscious bed again was quickly prest
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>By the fond pair, in lawless raptures blest.
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>Mars wonder'd at his Cytherea's charms,
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>More fast than ever lock'd within her arms.
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>While Vulcan th' iv'ry doors unbarr'd with care,
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>Then call'd the Gods to view the sportive pair:
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>The Gods throng'd in, and saw in open day,
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>Where Mars, and beauty's queen, all naked, lay.
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>O! shameful sight, if shameful that we name,
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>Which Gods with envy view'd, and could not blame;
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>But, for the pleasure, wish'd to bear the shame.
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>Each Deity, with laughter tir'd, departs,
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>Yet all still laugh'd at Vulcan in their hearts.
<A NAME="309"></A><BR><BR>Thro' Heav'n the news of this surprizal run,
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>But Venus did not thus forget the Sun.
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>He, who stol'n transports idly had betray'd,
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>By a betrayer was in kind repay'd.
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>What now avails, great God, thy piercing blaze,
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>That youth, and beauty, and those golden rays?
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>Thou, who can'st warm this universe alone,
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>Feel'st now a warmth more pow'rful than thy own:
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>And those bright eyes, which all things should survey,
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>Know not from fair Leucothoe to stray.
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>The lamp of light, for human good design'd,
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>Is to one virgin niggardly confin'd.
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>Sometimes too early rise thy eastern beams,
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>Sometimes too late they set in western streams:
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>'Tis then her beauty thy swift course delays,
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>And gives to winter skies long summer days.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>Now in thy face thy love-sick mind appears,
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>And spreads thro' impious nations empty fears:
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>For when thy beamless head is wrapt in night,
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>Poor mortals tremble in despair of light.
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>'Tis not the moon, that o'er thee casts a veil
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>'Tis love alone, which makes thy looks so pale.
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>Leucothoe is grown thy only care,
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>Not Phaeton's fair mother now is fair.
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>The youthful Rhodos moves no tender thought,
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>And beauteous Porsa is at last forgot.
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>Fond Clytie, scorn'd, yet lov'd, and sought thy 
<A NAME="336"></A>bed,
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>Ev'n then thy heart for other virgins bled.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>Leucothoe has all thy soul possest,
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>And chas'd each rival passion from thy breast.
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>To this bright nymph Eurynome gave birth
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>In the blest confines of the spicy Earth.
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>Excelling others, she herself beheld
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>By her own blooming daughter far excell'd.
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>The sire was Orchamus, whose vast command,
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>The sev'nth from Belus, rul'd the Persian Land.
<A NAME="346"></A><BR><BR>Deep in cool vales, beneath th' Hesperian sky,
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>For the Sun's fiery steeds the pastures lye.
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>Ambrosia there they eat, and thence they gain
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>New vigour, and their daily toils sustain.
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>While thus on heav'nly food the coursers fed,
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>And night, around, her gloomy empire spread,
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>The God assum'd the mother's shape and air,
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>And pass'd, unheeded, to his darling fair.
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>Close by a lamp, with maids encompass'd round,
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>The royal spinster, full employ'd, he found:
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>Then cry'd, A-while from work, my daughter, rest;
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>And, like a mother, scarce her lips he prest.
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>Servants retire!- nor secrets dare to hear,
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>Intrusted only to a daughter's ear.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>They swift obey'd: not one, suspicious, thought
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>The secret, which their mistress would be taught.
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>Then he: since now no witnesses are near,
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>Behold! the God, who guides the various year!
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>The world's vast eye, of light the source serene,
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>Who all things sees, by whom are all things seen.
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>Believe me, nymph! (for I the truth have show'd)
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>Thy charms have pow'r to charm so great a God.
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>Confus'd, she heard him his soft passion tell,
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>And on the floor, untwirl'd, the spindle fell:
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>Still from the sweet confusion some new grace
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>Blush'd out by stealth, and languish'd in her face.
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>The lover, now inflam'd, himself put on,
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>And out at once the God, all-radiant, shone.
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>The virgin startled at his alter'd form,
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>Too weak to bear a God's impetuous storm:
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>No more against the dazling youth she strove,
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>But silent yielded, and indulg'd his love.
<A NAME="378"></A><BR><BR>This Clytie knew, and knew she was undone,
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>Whose soul was fix'd, and doated on the Sun.
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>She rag'd to think on her neglected charms,
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>And Phoebus, panting in another's arms.
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>With envious madness fir'd, she flies in haste,
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>And tells the king, his daughter was unchaste.
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>The king, incens'd to hear his honour stain'd,
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>No more the father nor the man retain'd.
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>In vain she stretch'd her arms, and turn'd her eyes
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>To her lov'd God, th' enlightner of the skies.
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>In vain she own'd it was a crime, yet still
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>It was a crime not acted by her will.
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>The brutal sire stood deaf to ev'ry pray'r,
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>And deep in Earth entomb'd alive the fair.
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>What Phoebus could do, was by Phoebus done:
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>Full on her grave with pointed beams he shone:
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>To pointed beams the gaping Earth gave way;
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>Had the nymph eyes, her eyes had seen the day,
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>But lifeless now, yet lovely still, she lay.
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>Not more the God wept, when the world was fir'd,
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>And in the wreck his blooming boy expir'd.
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>The vital flame he strives to light again,
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>And warm the frozen blood in ev'ry vein:
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>But since resistless Fates deny'd that pow'r,
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>On the cold nymph he rain'd a nectar show'r.
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>Ah! undeserving thus (he said) to die,
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>Yet still in odours thou shalt reach the sky.
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>The body soon dissolv'd, and all around
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>Perfum'd with heav'nly fragrancies the ground,
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>A sacrifice for Gods up-rose from thence,
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>A sweet, delightful tree of frankincense.
<A NAME="409"></A><BR><BR><B>The Transformation of Clytie</B>
<A NAME="410"></A><BR><BR>Tho' guilty Clytie thus the sun betray'd,
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>By too much passion she was guilty made.
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>Excess of love begot excess of grief,
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>Grief fondly bad her hence to hope relief.
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>But angry Phoebus hears, unmov'd, her sighs,
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>And scornful from her loath'd embraces flies.
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>All day, all night, in trackless wilds, alone
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>She pin'd, and taught the list'ning rocks her moan.
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>On the bare earth she lies, her bosom bare,
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>Loose her attire, dishevel'd is her hair.
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>Nine times the morn unbarr'd the gates of light,
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>As oft were spread th' alternate shades of night,
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>So long no sustenance the mourner knew,
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>Unless she drunk her tears, or suck'd the dew.
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>She turn'd about, but rose not from the ground,
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>Turn'd to the Sun, still as he roul'd his round:
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>On his bright face hung her desiring eyes,
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>'Till fix'd to Earth, she strove in vain to rise.
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>Her looks their paleness in a flow'r retain'd,
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>But here, and there, some purple streaks they gain'd.
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>Still the lov'd object the fond leafs pursue,
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>Still move their root, the moving Sun to view,
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>And in the Heliotrope the nymph is true.
<A NAME="433"></A><BR><BR>The sisters heard these wonders with surprise,
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>But part receiv'd them as romantick lies;
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>And pertly rally'd, that they could not see
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>In Pow'rs divine so vast an energy.
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>Part own'd, true Gods such miracles might do,
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>But own'd not Bacchus, one among the true.
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>At last a common, just request they make,
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>And beg Alcithoe her turn to take.
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>I will (she said) and please you, if I can.
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>Then shot her shuttle swift, and thus began.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR><BR>The fate of Daphnis is a fate too known,
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>Whom an enamour'd nymph transform'd to stone,
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>Because she fear'd another nymph might see
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>The lovely youth, and love as much as she:
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>So strange the madness is of jealousie!
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>Nor shall I tell, what changes Scython made,
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>And how he walk'd a man, or tripp'd a maid.
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>You too would peevish frown, and patience want
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>To hear, how Celmis grew an adamant.
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>He once was dear to Jove, and saw of old
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>Jove, when a child; but what he saw, he told.
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>Crocus, and Smilax may be turn'd to flow'rs,
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>And the Curetes spring from bounteous show'rs;
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>I pass a hundred legends stale, as these,
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>And with sweet novelty your taste will please.
<A NAME="458"></A><BR><BR><B>The Story of Salmacis and Hermaphroditus</B>
<A NAME="459"></A><BR><BR>How Salmacis, with weak enfeebling streams
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>Softens the body, and unnerves the limbs,
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>And what the secret cause, shall here be shown;
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>The cause is secret, but th' effect is known.
<A NAME="463"></A><BR><BR>The Naids nurst an infant heretofore,
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>That Cytherea once to Hermes bore:
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>From both th' illustrious authors of his race
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>The child was nam'd, nor was it hard to trace
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>Both the bright parents thro' the infant's face.
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>When fifteen years in Ida's cool retreat
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>The boy had told, he left his native seat,
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>And sought fresh fountains in a foreign soil:
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>The pleasure lessen'd the attending toil,
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>With eager steps the Lycian fields he crost,
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>A river here he view'd so lovely bright,
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>It shew'd the bottom in a fairer light,
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>Nor kept a sand conceal'd from human sight.
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>The stream produc'd nor slimy ooze, nor weeds,
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>Nor miry rushes, nor the spiky reeds;
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>But dealt enriching moisture all around,
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>The fruitful banks with chearful verdure crown'd,
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>And kept the spring eternal on the ground.
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>A nymph presides, not practis'd in the chace,
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>Nor skilful at the bow, nor at the race;
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>Of all the blue-ey'd daughters of the main,
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>The only stranger to Diana's train:
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>Her sisters often, as 'tis said, wou'd cry,
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>"Fie Salmacis: what, always idle! fie.
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>Or take thy quiver, or thy arrows seize,
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>And mix the toils of hunting with thy ease."
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>Nor quiver she nor arrows e'er wou'd seize,
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>Nor mix the toils of hunting with her ease.
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>But oft would bathe her in the chrystal tide,
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>Oft with a comb her dewy locks divide;
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>Now in the limpid streams she views her face,
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>And drest her image in the floating glass:
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>On beds of leaves she now repos'd her limbs,
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>Now gather'd flow'rs that grew about her streams,
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>And then by chance was gathering, as he stood
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>To view the boy, and long'd for what she view'd.
<A NAME="499"></A><BR><BR>Fain wou'd she meet the youth with hasty feet,
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>She fain wou'd meet him, but refus'd to meet
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>Before her looks were set with nicest care,
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>And well deserv'd to be reputed fair.
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>"Bright youth," she cries, "whom all thy features 
<A NAME="504"></A>prove
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>A God, and, if a God, the God of love;
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>But if a mortal, blest thy nurse's breast,
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>Blest are thy parents, and thy sisters blest:
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>But oh how blest! how more than blest thy bride,
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>Ally'd in bliss, if any yet ally'd.
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>If so, let mine the stoln enjoyments be;
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>If not, behold a willing bride in me."
<A NAME="512"></A><BR><BR>The boy knew nought of love, and toucht with 
<A NAME="513"></A>shame,
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>He strove, and blusht, but still the blush became:
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>In rising blushes still fresh beauties rose;
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>The sunny side of fruit such blushes shows,
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>And such the moon, when all her silver white
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>Turns in eclipses to a ruddy light.
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>The nymph still begs, if not a nobler bliss,
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>A cold salute at least, a sister's kiss:
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>And now prepares to take the lovely boy
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>Between her arms. He, innocently coy,
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>Replies, "Or leave me to my self alone,
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>You rude uncivil nymph, or I'll be gone."
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>"Fair stranger then," says she, "it shall be so";
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>And, for she fear'd his threats, she feign'd to 
<A NAME="527"></A>go:
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>But hid within a covert's neighbouring green,
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>She kept him still in sight, herself unseen.
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>The boy now fancies all the danger o'er,
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>And innocently sports about the shore,
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>Playful and wanton to the stream he trips,
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>And dips his foot, and shivers as he dips.
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>The coolness pleas'd him, and with eager haste
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>His airy garments on the banks he cast;
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>His godlike features, and his heav'nly hue,
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>And all his beauties were expos'd to view.
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>His naked limbs the nymph with rapture spies,
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>While hotter passions in her bosom rise,
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>Flush in her cheeks, and sparkle in her eyes.
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>She longs, she burns to clasp him in her arms,
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>And looks, and sighs, and kindles at his charms.
<A NAME="543"></A><BR><BR>Now all undrest upon the banks he stood,
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>And clapt his sides, and leapt into the flood:
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>His lovely limbs the silver waves divide,
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>His limbs appear more lovely through the tide;
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>As lillies shut within a chrystal case,
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>Receive a glossy lustre from the glass.
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>He's mine, he's all my own, the Naid cries,
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>And flings off all, and after him she flies.
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>And now she fastens on him as he swims,
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>And holds him close, and wraps about his limbs.
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>The more the boy resisted, and was coy,
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>The more she clipt, and kist the strugling boy.
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>So when the wrigling snake is snatcht on high
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>In Eagle's claws, and hisses in the sky,
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>Around the foe his twirling tail he flings,
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>And twists her legs, and wriths about her wings.
<A NAME="559"></A><BR><BR>The restless boy still obstinately strove
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>To free himself, and still refus'd her love.
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>Amidst his limbs she kept her limbs intwin'd,
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>"And why, coy youth," she cries, "why thus unkind!
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>Oh may the Gods thus keep us ever join'd!
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>Oh may we never, never part again!"
<A NAME="565"></A><BR><BR>So pray'd the nymph, nor did she pray in vain:
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>For now she finds him, as his limbs she prest,
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>Grow nearer still, and nearer to her breast;
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>'Till, piercing each the other's flesh, they run
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>Together, and incorporate in one:
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>Last in one face are both their faces join'd,
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>As when the stock and grafted twig combin'd
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>Shoot up the same, and wear a common rind:
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>Both bodies in a single body mix,
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>A single body with a double sex.
<A NAME="575"></A><BR><BR>The boy, thus lost in woman, now survey'd
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>The river's guilty stream, and thus he pray'd.
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>(He pray'd, but wonder'd at his softer tone,
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>Surpriz'd to hear a voice but half his own.)
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>You parent-Gods, whose heav'nly names I bear,
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>Hear your Hermaphrodite, and grant my pray'r;
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>Oh grant, that whomsoe'er these streams contain,
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>If man he enter'd, he may rise again
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>Supple, unsinew'd, and but half a man!
<A NAME="584"></A><BR><BR>The heav'nly parents answer'd from on high,
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>Their two-shap'd son, the double votary
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>Then gave a secret virtue to the flood,
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>And ting'd its source to make his wishes good.
<A NAME="588"></A><BR><BR><B>Alcithoe and her Sisters transform'd to Bats</B>
<A NAME="589"></A><BR><BR>But Mineus' daughters still their tasks pursue,
<A NAME="590"></A><BR>To wickedness most obstinately true:
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>At Bacchus still they laugh, when all around,
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>Unseen, the timbrels hoarse were heard to sound.
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>Saffron and myrrh their fragrant odours shed,
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>And now the present deity they dread.
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>Strange to relate! Here ivy first was seen,
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>Along the distaff crept the wond'rous green.
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>Then sudden-springing vines began to bloom,
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>And the soft tendrils curl'd around the loom:
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>While purple clusters, dangling from on high,
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>Ting'd the wrought purple with a second die.
<A NAME="601"></A><BR><BR>Now from the skies was shot a doubtful light,
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>The day declining to the bounds of night.
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>The fabrick's firm foundations shake all o'er,
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>False tigers rage, and figur'd lions roar.
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>Torches, aloft, seem blazing in the air,
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>And angry flashes of red light'nings glare.
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>To dark recesses, the dire sight to shun,
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>Swift the pale sisters in confusion run.
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>Their arms were lost in pinions, as they fled,
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>And subtle films each slender limb o'er-spread.
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>Their alter'd forms their senses soon reveal'd;
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>Their forms, how alter'd, darkness still conceal'd.
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>Close to the roof each, wond'ring, upwards springs,
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>Born on unknown, transparent, plumeless wings.
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>They strove for words; their little bodies found
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>No words, but murmur'd in a fainting sound.
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>In towns, not woods, the sooty bats delight,
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>And, never, 'till the dusk, begin their flight;
<A NAME="619"></A><BR>'Till Vesper rises with his ev'ning flame;
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>From whom the Romans have deriv'd their name.
<A NAME="621"></A><BR><BR><B>The Transformation of Ino and Melicerta to 
<A NAME="622"></A>Sea-Gods</B>
<A NAME="623"></A><BR><BR>The pow'r of Bacchus now o'er Thebes had flown:
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>With awful rev'rence soon the God they own.
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>Proud Ino, all around the wonder tells,
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>And on her nephew deity still dwells.
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>Of num'rous sisters, she alone yet knew
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>No grief, but grief, which she from sisters drew.
<A NAME="629"></A><BR><BR>Imperial Juno saw her with disdain,
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>Vain in her offspring, in her consort vain,
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>Who rul'd the trembling Thebans with a nod,
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>But saw her vainest in her foster-God.
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>Could then (she cry'd) a bastard-boy have pow'r
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>To make a mother her own son devour?
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>Could he the Tuscan crew to fishes change,
<A NAME="636"></A><BR>And now three sisters damn to forms so strange?
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>Yet shall the wife of Jove find no relief?
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>Shall she, still unreveng'd, disclose her grief?
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>Have I the mighty freedom to complain?
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>Is that my pow'r? is that to ease my pain?
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>A foe has taught me vengeance; and who ought
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>To scorn that vengeance, which a foe has taught?
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>What sure destruction frantick rage can throw,
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>The gaping wounds of slaughter'd Pentheus show.
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>Why should not Ino, fir'd with madness, stray,
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>Like her mad sisters her own kindred slay?
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>Why, she not follow, where they lead the way?
<A NAME="648"></A><BR><BR>Down a steep, yawning cave, where yews display'd
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>In arches meet, and lend a baleful shade,
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>Thro' silent labyrinths a passage lies
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>To mournful regions, and infernal skies.
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>Here Styx exhales its noisome clouds, and here,
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>The fun'ral rites once paid, all souls appear.
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>Stiff cold, and horror with a ghastly face
<A NAME="655"></A><BR>And staring eyes, infest the dreary place.
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>Ghosts, new-arriv'd, and strangers to these plains,
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>Know not the palace, where grim Pluto reigns.
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>They journey doubtful, nor the road can tell,
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>Which leads to the metropolis of Hell.
<A NAME="660"></A><BR>A thousand avenues those tow'rs command,
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>A thousand gates for ever open stand.
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>As all the rivers, disembogu'd, find room
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>For all their waters in old Ocean's womb:
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>So this vast city worlds of shades receives,
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>And space for millions still of worlds she leaves.
<A NAME="666"></A><BR>Th' unbody'd spectres freely rove, and show
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>Whate'er they lov'd on Earth, they love below.
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>The lawyers still, or right, or wrong, support,
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>The courtiers smoothly glide to Pluto's court.
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>Still airy heroes thoughts of glory fire,
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>Still the dead poet strings his deathless lyre,
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>And lovers still with fancy'd darts expire.
<A NAME="673"></A><BR><BR>The Queen of Heaven, to gratify her hate,
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>And sooth immortal wrath, forgets her state.
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>Down from the realms of day, to realms of night,
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>The Goddess swift precipitates her flight.
<A NAME="677"></A><BR>At Hell arriv'd, the noise Hell's porter heard,
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>Th' enormous dog his triple head up-rear'd:
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>Thrice from three grizly throats he howl'd profound,
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>Then suppliant couch'd, and stretch'd along the 
<A NAME="681"></A>ground.
<A NAME="682"></A><BR>The trembling threshold, which Saturnia prest,
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>The weight of such divinity confest.
<A NAME="684"></A><BR><BR>Before a lofty, adamantine gate,
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>Which clos'd a tow'r of brass, the Furies sate:
<A NAME="686"></A><BR>Mis-shapen forms, tremendous to the sight,
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>Th' implacable foul daughters of the night.
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>A sounding whip each bloody sister shakes,
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>Or from her tresses combs the curling snakes.
<A NAME="690"></A><BR>But now great Juno's majesty was known;
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>Thro' the thick gloom, all heav'nly bright, she 
<A NAME="692"></A>shone:
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>The hideous monsters their obedience show'd,
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>And rising from their seats, submissive bow'd.
<A NAME="695"></A><BR><BR>This is the place of woe, here groan the dead;
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>Huge Tityus o'er nine acres here is spread.
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>Fruitful for pain th' immortal liver breeds,
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>Still grows, and still th' insatiate vulture feeds.
<A NAME="699"></A><BR>Poor Tantalus to taste the water tries,
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>But from his lips the faithless water flies:
<A NAME="701"></A><BR>Then thinks the bending tree he can command,
<A NAME="702"></A><BR>The tree starts backwards, and eludes his hand.
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>The labour too of Sisyphus is vain,
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>Up the steep mount he heaves the stone with pain,
<A NAME="705"></A><BR>Down from the summet rouls the stone again.
<A NAME="706"></A><BR>The Belides their leaky vessels still
<A NAME="707"></A><BR>Are ever filling, and yet never fill:
<A NAME="708"></A><BR>Doom'd to this punishment for blood they shed,
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>For bridegrooms slaughter'd in the bridal bed.
<A NAME="710"></A><BR>Stretch'd on the rolling wheel Ixion lies;
<A NAME="711"></A><BR>Himself he follows, and himself he flies.
<A NAME="712"></A><BR>Ixion, tortur'd, Juno sternly ey'd,
<A NAME="713"></A><BR>Then turn'd, and toiling Sisyphus espy'd:
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>And why (she said) so wretched is the fate
<A NAME="715"></A><BR>Of him, whose brother proudly reigns in state?
<A NAME="716"></A><BR>Yet still my altars unador'd have been
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>By Athamas, and his presumptuous queen.
<A NAME="718"></A><BR><BR>What caus'd her hate, the Goddess thus confest,
<A NAME="719"></A><BR>What caus'd her journey now was more than guest.
<A NAME="720"></A><BR>That hate, relentless, its revenge did want,
<A NAME="721"></A><BR>And that revenge the Furies soon could grant:
<A NAME="722"></A><BR>They could the glory of proud Thebes efface,
<A NAME="723"></A><BR>And hide in ruin the Cadmean race.
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>For this she largely promises, entreats,
<A NAME="725"></A><BR>And to intreaties adds imperial threats.
<A NAME="726"></A><BR><BR>Then fell Tisiphone with rage was stung,
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>And from her mouth th' untwisted serpents flung.
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>To gain this trifling boon, there is no need
<A NAME="729"></A><BR>(She cry'd) in formal speeches to proceed.
<A NAME="730"></A><BR>Whatever thou command'st to do, is done;
<A NAME="731"></A><BR>Believe it finish'd, tho' not yet begun.
<A NAME="732"></A><BR>But from these melancholly seats repair
<A NAME="733"></A><BR>To happier mansions, and to purer air.
<A NAME="734"></A><BR>She spoke: the Goddess, darting upwards, flies,
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>And joyous re-ascends her native skies:
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>Nor enter'd there, till 'round her Iris threw
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>Ambrosial sweets, and pour'd celestial dew.
<A NAME="738"></A><BR><BR>The faithful Fury, guiltless of delays,
<A NAME="739"></A><BR>With cruel haste the dire command obeys.
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>Girt in a bloody gown, a torch she shakes,
<A NAME="741"></A><BR>And round her neck twines speckled wreaths of snakes.
<A NAME="742"></A><BR>Fear, and dismay, and agonizing pain,
<A NAME="743"></A><BR>With frantick rage, compleat her loveless train.
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>To Thebes her flight she sped, and Hell forsook;
<A NAME="745"></A><BR>At her approach the Theban turrets shook:
<A NAME="746"></A><BR>The sun shrunk back, thick clouds the day o'er-cast,
<A NAME="747"></A><BR>And springing greens were wither'd as she past.
<A NAME="748"></A><BR><BR>Now, dismal yellings heard, strange spectres 
<A NAME="749"></A>seen,
<A NAME="750"></A><BR>Confound as much the monarch as the queen.
<A NAME="751"></A><BR>In vain to quit the palace they prepar'd,
<A NAME="752"></A><BR>Tisiphone was there, and kept the ward.
<A NAME="753"></A><BR>She wide extended her unfriendly arms,
<A NAME="754"></A><BR>And all the Fury lavish'd all her harms.
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>Part of her tresses loudly hiss, and part
<A NAME="756"></A><BR>Spread poyson, as their forky tongues they dart.
<A NAME="757"></A><BR>Then from her middle locks two snakes she drew,
<A NAME="758"></A><BR>Whose merit from superior mischief grew:
<A NAME="759"></A><BR>Th' envenom'd ruin, thrown with spiteful care,
<A NAME="760"></A><BR>Clung to the bosoms of the hapless pair.
<A NAME="761"></A><BR>The hapless pair soon with wild thoughts were fir'd,
<A NAME="762"></A><BR>And madness, by a thousand ways inspir'd.
<A NAME="763"></A><BR>'Tis true, th' unwounded body still was sound,
<A NAME="764"></A><BR>But 'twas the soul which felt the deadly wound.
<A NAME="765"></A><BR>Nor did th' unsated monster here give o'er,
<A NAME="766"></A><BR>But dealt of plagues a fresh, unnumber'd store.
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>Each baneful juice too well she understood,
<A NAME="768"></A><BR>Foam, churn'd by Cerberus, and Hydra's blood.
<A NAME="769"></A><BR>Hot hemlock, and cold aconite she chose,
<A NAME="770"></A><BR>Delighted in variety of woes.
<A NAME="771"></A><BR>Whatever can untune th' harmonious soul,
<A NAME="772"></A><BR>And its mild, reas'ning faculties controul,
<A NAME="773"></A><BR>Give false ideas, raise desires profane,
<A NAME="774"></A><BR>And whirl in eddies the tumultuous brain,
<A NAME="775"></A><BR>Mix'd with curs'd art, she direfully around
<A NAME="776"></A><BR>Thro' all their nerves diffus'd the sad compound.
<A NAME="777"></A><BR>Then toss'd her torch in circles still the same,
<A NAME="778"></A><BR>Improv'd their rage, and added flame to flame.
<A NAME="779"></A><BR>The grinning Fury her own conquest spy'd,
<A NAME="780"></A><BR>And to her rueful shades return'd with pride,
<A NAME="781"></A><BR>And threw th' exhausted, useless snakes aside.
<A NAME="782"></A><BR><BR>Now Athamas cries out, his reason fled,
<A NAME="783"></A><BR>Here, fellow-hunters, let the toils be spread.
<A NAME="784"></A><BR>I saw a lioness, in quest of food,
<A NAME="785"></A><BR>With her two young, run roaring in this wood.
<A NAME="786"></A><BR>Again the fancy'd savages were seen,
<A NAME="787"></A><BR>As thro' his palace still he chac'd his queen;
<A NAME="788"></A><BR>Then tore Learchus from her breast: the child
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>Stretch'd little arms, and on its father smil'd:
<A NAME="790"></A><BR>A father now no more, who now begun
<A NAME="791"></A><BR>Around his head to whirl his giddy son,
<A NAME="792"></A><BR>And, quite insensible to Nature's call,
<A NAME="793"></A><BR>The helpless infant flung against the wall.
<A NAME="794"></A><BR>The same mad poyson in the mother wrought,
<A NAME="795"></A><BR>Young Melicerta in her arms she caught,
<A NAME="796"></A><BR>And with disorder'd tresses, howling, flies,
<A NAME="797"></A><BR>O! Bacchus, Evoe, Bacchus! loud she cries.
<A NAME="798"></A><BR>The name of Bacchus Juno laugh'd to hear,
<A NAME="799"></A><BR>And said, Thy foster-God has cost thee dear.
<A NAME="800"></A><BR><BR>A rock there stood, whose side the beating waves
<A NAME="801"></A><BR>Had long consum'd, and hollow'd into caves.
<A NAME="802"></A><BR>The head shot forwards in a bending steep,
<A NAME="803"></A><BR>And cast a dreadful covert o'er the deep.
<A NAME="804"></A><BR>The wretched Ino, on destruction bent,
<A NAME="805"></A><BR>Climb'd up the cliff; such strength her fury lent:
<A NAME="806"></A><BR>Thence with her guiltless boy, who wept in vain,
<A NAME="807"></A><BR>At one bold spring she plung'd into the main.
<A NAME="808"></A><BR><BR>Her neice's fate touch'd Cytherea's breast,
<A NAME="809"></A><BR>And in soft sounds she Neptune thus addrest:
<A NAME="810"></A><BR>Great God of waters, whose extended sway
<A NAME="811"></A><BR>Is next to his, whom Heav'n and Earth obey:
<A NAME="812"></A><BR>Let not the suit of Venus thee displease,
<A NAME="813"></A><BR>Pity the floaters on th' Ionian seas.
<A NAME="814"></A><BR>Encrease thy Subject-Gods, nor yet disdain
<A NAME="815"></A><BR>To add my kindred to that glorious train.
<A NAME="816"></A><BR>If from the sea I may such honours claim,
<A NAME="817"></A><BR>If 'tis desert, that from the sea I came,
<A NAME="818"></A><BR>As Grecian poets artfully have sung,
<A NAME="819"></A><BR>And in the name confest, from whence I sprung.
<A NAME="820"></A><BR><BR>Pleas'd Neptune nodded his assent, and free
<A NAME="821"></A><BR>Both soon became from frail mortality.
<A NAME="822"></A><BR>He gave them form, and majesty divine,
<A NAME="823"></A><BR>And bad them glide along the foamy brine.
<A NAME="824"></A><BR>For Melicerta is Palaemon known,
<A NAME="825"></A><BR>And Ino once, Leucothoe is grown.
<A NAME="826"></A><BR><BR><B>The Transformation of the Theban Matrons</B>
<A NAME="827"></A><BR><BR>The Theban matrons their lov'd queen pursu'd,
<A NAME="828"></A><BR>And tracing to the rock, her footsteps view'd.
<A NAME="829"></A><BR>Too certain of her fate, they rend the skies
<A NAME="830"></A><BR>With piteous shrieks, and lamentable cries.
<A NAME="831"></A><BR>All beat their breasts, and Juno all upbraid,
<A NAME="832"></A><BR>Who still remember'd a deluded maid:
<A NAME="833"></A><BR>Who, still revengeful for one stol'n embrace,
<A NAME="834"></A><BR>Thus wreak'd her hate on the Cadmean race.
<A NAME="835"></A><BR>This Juno heard: And shall such elfs, she cry'd,
<A NAME="836"></A><BR>Dispute my justice, or my pow'r deride?
<A NAME="837"></A><BR>You too shall feel my wrath not idly spent;
<A NAME="838"></A><BR>A Goddess never for insults was meant.
<A NAME="839"></A><BR><BR>She, who lov'd most, and who most lov'd had 
<A NAME="840"></A>been,
<A NAME="841"></A><BR>Said, Not the waves shall part me from my queen.
<A NAME="842"></A><BR>She strove to plunge into the roaring flood;
<A NAME="843"></A><BR>Fix'd to the stone, a stone her self she stood.
<A NAME="844"></A><BR>This, on her breast would fain her blows repeat,
<A NAME="845"></A><BR>Her stiffen'd hands refus'd her breast to beat.
<A NAME="846"></A><BR>That, stretch'd her arms unto the seas; in vain
<A NAME="847"></A><BR>Her arms she labour'd to unstretch again.
<A NAME="848"></A><BR>To tear her comely locks another try'd,
<A NAME="849"></A><BR>Both comely locks, and fingers petryfi'd.
<A NAME="850"></A><BR>Part thus; but Juno with a softer mind
<A NAME="851"></A><BR>Part doom'd to mix among the feather'd kind.
<A NAME="852"></A><BR>Transform'd, the name of Theban birds they keep,
<A NAME="853"></A><BR>And skim the surface of that fatal deep.
<A NAME="854"></A><BR><BR><B>Cadmus and his Queen transform'd to Serpents</B>
<A NAME="855"></A><BR><BR>Mean-time, the wretched Cadmus mourns, nor knows,
<A NAME="856"></A><BR>That they who mortal fell, immortal rose.
<A NAME="857"></A><BR>With a long series of new ills opprest,
<A NAME="858"></A><BR>He droops, and all the man forsakes his breast.
<A NAME="859"></A><BR>Strange prodigies confound his frighted eyes;
<A NAME="860"></A><BR>From the fair city, which he rais'd, he flies:
<A NAME="861"></A><BR>As if misfortune not pursu'd his race,
<A NAME="862"></A><BR>But only hung o'er that devoted place.
<A NAME="863"></A><BR>Resolv'd by sea to seek some distant land,
<A NAME="864"></A><BR>At last he safely gain'd th' Illyrian strand.
<A NAME="865"></A><BR>Chearless himself, his consort still he chears,
<A NAME="866"></A><BR>Hoary, and loaden'd both with woes and years.
<A NAME="867"></A><BR>Then to recount past sorrows they begin,
<A NAME="868"></A><BR>And trace them to the gloomy origin.
<A NAME="869"></A><BR>That serpent sure was hallow'd, Cadmus cry'd,
<A NAME="870"></A><BR>Which once my spear transfix'd with foolish pride;
<A NAME="871"></A><BR>When the big teeth, a seed before unknown,
<A NAME="872"></A><BR>By me along the wond'ring glebe were sown,
<A NAME="873"></A><BR>And sprouting armies by themselves o'erthrown.
<A NAME="874"></A><BR>If thence the wrath of Heav'n on me is bent,
<A NAME="875"></A><BR>May Heav'n conclude it with one sad event;
<A NAME="876"></A><BR>To an extended serpent change the man:
<A NAME="877"></A><BR>And while he spoke, the wish'd-for change began.
<A NAME="878"></A><BR>His skin with sea-green spots was vary'd 'round,
<A NAME="879"></A><BR>And on his belly prone he prest the ground.
<A NAME="880"></A><BR>He glitter'd soon with many a golden scale,
<A NAME="881"></A><BR>And his shrunk legs clos'd in a spiry tail.
<A NAME="882"></A><BR>Arms yet remain'd, remaining arms he spread
<A NAME="883"></A><BR>To his lov'd wife, and human tears yet shed.
<A NAME="884"></A><BR>Come, my Harmonia, come, thy face recline
<A NAME="885"></A><BR>Down to my face; still touch, what still is mine.
<A NAME="886"></A><BR>O! let these hands, while hands, be gently prest,
<A NAME="887"></A><BR>While yet the serpent has not all possest.
<A NAME="888"></A><BR>More he had spoke, but strove to speak in vain,
<A NAME="889"></A><BR>The forky tongue refus'd to tell his pain,
<A NAME="890"></A><BR>And learn'd in hissings only to complain.
<A NAME="891"></A><BR><BR>Then shriek'd Harmonia, Stay, my Cadmus, stay,
<A NAME="892"></A><BR>Glide not in such a monstrous shape away!
<A NAME="893"></A><BR>Destruction, like impetuous waves, rouls on.
<A NAME="894"></A><BR>Where are thy feet, thy legs, thy shoulders gone?
<A NAME="895"></A><BR>Chang'd is thy visage, chang'd is all thy frame;
<A NAME="896"></A><BR>Cadmus is only Cadmus now in name.
<A NAME="897"></A><BR>Ye Gods, my Cadmus to himself restore,
<A NAME="898"></A><BR>Or me like him transform; I ask no more.
<A NAME="899"></A><BR><BR>The husband-serpent show'd he still had thought,
<A NAME="900"></A><BR>With wonted fondness an embrace he sought;
<A NAME="901"></A><BR>Play'd 'round her neck in many a harmless twist,
<A NAME="902"></A><BR>And lick'd that bosom, which, a man, he kist.
<A NAME="903"></A><BR>The lookers-on (for lookers-on there were)
<A NAME="904"></A><BR>Shock'd at the sight, half-dy'd away with fear.
<A NAME="905"></A><BR>The transformation was again renew'd,
<A NAME="906"></A><BR>And, like the husband, chang'd the wife they view'd.
<A NAME="907"></A><BR>Both, serpents now, with fold involv'd in fold,
<A NAME="908"></A><BR>To the next covert amicably roul'd.
<A NAME="909"></A><BR>There curl'd they lie, or wave along the green,
<A NAME="910"></A><BR>Fearless see men, by men are fearless seen,
<A NAME="911"></A><BR>Still mild, and conscious what they once have been.
<A NAME="912"></A><BR><BR><B>The Story of Perseus</B>
<A NAME="913"></A><BR><BR>Yet tho' this harsh, inglorious fate they found,
<A NAME="914"></A><BR>Each in the deathless grandson liv'd renown'd.
<A NAME="915"></A><BR>Thro' conquer'd India Bacchus nobly rode,
<A NAME="916"></A><BR>And Greece with temples hail'd the conqu'ring God.
<A NAME="917"></A><BR>In Argos only proud Acrisius reign'd,
<A NAME="918"></A><BR>Who all the consecrated rites profan'd.
<A NAME="919"></A><BR>Audacious wretch! thus Bacchus to deny,
<A NAME="920"></A><BR>And the great Thunderer's great son defie!
<A NAME="921"></A><BR>Nor him alone: thy daughter vainly strove,
<A NAME="922"></A><BR>Brave Perseus of celestial stem to prove,
<A NAME="923"></A><BR>And her self pregnant by a golden Jove.
<A NAME="924"></A><BR>Yet this was true, and truth in time prevails;
<A NAME="925"></A><BR>Acrisius now his unbelief bewails.
<A NAME="926"></A><BR>His former thought, an impious thought he found,
<A NAME="927"></A><BR>And both the heroe, and the God were own'd.
<A NAME="928"></A><BR>He saw, already one in Heav'n was plac'd,
<A NAME="929"></A><BR>And one with more than mortal triumphs grac'd,
<A NAME="930"></A><BR>The victor Perseus with the Gorgon-head,
<A NAME="931"></A><BR>O'er Libyan sands his airy journey sped.
<A NAME="932"></A><BR>The gory drops distill'd, as swift he flew,
<A NAME="933"></A><BR>And from each drop envenom'd serpents grew,
<A NAME="934"></A><BR>The mischiefs brooded on the barren plains,
<A NAME="935"></A><BR>And still th' unhappy fruitfulness remains.
<A NAME="936"></A><BR><BR><B>Atlas transform'd to a Mountain</B>
<A NAME="937"></A><BR><BR>Thence Perseus, like a cloud, by storms was 
<A NAME="938"></A>driv'n,
<A NAME="939"></A><BR>Thro' all th' expanse beneath the cope of Heaven.
<A NAME="940"></A><BR>The jarring winds unable to controul,
<A NAME="941"></A><BR>He saw the southern, and the northern pole:
<A NAME="942"></A><BR>And eastward thrice, and westward thrice was whirl'd,
<A NAME="943"></A><BR>And from the skies survey'd the nether world.
<A NAME="944"></A><BR>But when grey ev'ning show'd the verge of night,
<A NAME="945"></A><BR>He fear'd in darkness to pursue his flight.
<A NAME="946"></A><BR>He pois'd his pinions, and forgot to soar,
<A NAME="947"></A><BR>And sinking, clos'd them on th' Hesperian shore:
<A NAME="948"></A><BR>Then beg'd to rest, 'till Lucifer begun
<A NAME="949"></A><BR>To wake the morn, the morn to wake the sun.
<A NAME="950"></A><BR><BR>Here Atlas reign'd, of more than human size,
<A NAME="951"></A><BR>And in his kingdom the world's limit lies.
<A NAME="952"></A><BR>Here Titan bids his weary'd coursers sleep,
<A NAME="953"></A><BR>And cools the burning axle in the deep.
<A NAME="954"></A><BR>The mighty monarch, uncontrol'd, alone,
<A NAME="955"></A><BR>His sceptre sways: no neighb'ring states are known.
<A NAME="956"></A><BR>A thousand flocks on shady mountains fed,
<A NAME="957"></A><BR>A thousand herds o'er grassy plains were spread.
<A NAME="958"></A><BR>Here wond'rous trees their shining stores unfold,
<A NAME="959"></A><BR>Their shining stores too wond'rous to be told,
<A NAME="960"></A><BR>Their leafs, their branches, and their apples, gold.
<A NAME="961"></A><BR>Then Perseus the gigantick prince addrest,
<A NAME="962"></A><BR>Humbly implor'd a hospitable rest.
<A NAME="963"></A><BR>If bold exploits thy admiration fire,
<A NAME="964"></A><BR>He said, I fancy, mine thou wilt admire.
<A NAME="965"></A><BR>Or if the glory of a race can move,
<A NAME="966"></A><BR>Not mean my glory, for I spring from Jove.
<A NAME="967"></A><BR>At this confession Atlas ghastly star'd,
<A NAME="968"></A><BR>Mindful of what an oracle declar'd,
<A NAME="969"></A><BR>That the dark womb of Time conceal'd a day,
<A NAME="970"></A><BR>Which should, disclos'd, the bloomy gold betray:
<A NAME="971"></A><BR>All should at once be ravish'd from his eyes,
<A NAME="972"></A><BR>And Jove's own progeny enjoy the prize.
<A NAME="973"></A><BR>For this, the fruit he loftily immur'd,
<A NAME="974"></A><BR>And a fierce dragon the strait pass secur'd.
<A NAME="975"></A><BR>For this, all strangers he forbad to land,
<A NAME="976"></A><BR>And drove them from th' inhospitable strand.
<A NAME="977"></A><BR>To Perseus then: Fly quickly, fly this coast,
<A NAME="978"></A><BR>Nor falsly dare thy acts and race to boast.
<A NAME="979"></A><BR>In vain the heroe for one night entreats,
<A NAME="980"></A><BR>Threat'ning he storms, and next adds force to threats.
<A NAME="981"></A><BR>By strength not Perseus could himself defend,
<A NAME="982"></A><BR>For who in strength with Atlas could contend?
<A NAME="983"></A><BR>But since short rest to me thou wilt not give,
<A NAME="984"></A><BR>A gift of endless rest from me receive,
<A NAME="985"></A><BR>He said, and backward turn'd, no more conceal'd
<A NAME="986"></A><BR>The present, and Medusa's head reveal'd.
<A NAME="987"></A><BR>Soon the high Atlas a high mountain stood,
<A NAME="988"></A><BR>His locks, and beard became a leafy wood.
<A NAME="989"></A><BR>His hands, and shoulders, into ridges went,
<A NAME="990"></A><BR>The summit-head still crown'd the steep ascent.
<A NAME="991"></A><BR>His bones a solid, rocky hardness gain'd:
<A NAME="992"></A><BR>He, thus immensely grown (as fate ordain'd),
<A NAME="993"></A><BR>The stars, the Heav'ns, and all the Gods sustain'd.
<A NAME="994"></A><BR><BR><B>Andromeda rescu'd from the Sea Monster</B>
<A NAME="995"></A><BR><BR>Now Aeolus had with strong chains confin'd,
<A NAME="996"></A><BR>And deep imprison'd e'vry blust'ring wind,
<A NAME="997"></A><BR>The rising Phospher with a purple light
<A NAME="998"></A><BR>Did sluggish mortals to new toils invite.
<A NAME="999"></A><BR>His feet again the valiant Perseus plumes,
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR>And his keen sabre in his hand resumes:
<A NAME="1001"></A><BR>Then nobly spurns the ground, and upwards springs,
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR>And cuts the liquid air with sounding wings.
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR>O'er various seas, and various lands he past,
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR>'Till Aethiopia's shore appear'd at last.
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR>Andromeda was there, doom'd to attone
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR>By her own ruin follies not her own:
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR>And if injustice in a God can be,
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR>Such was the Libyan God's unjust decree.
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR>Chain'd to a rock she stood; young Perseus stay'd
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR>His rapid flight, to view the beauteous maid.
<A NAME="1011"></A><BR>So sweet her frame, so exquisitely fine,
<A NAME="1012"></A><BR>She seem'd a statue by a hand divine,
<A NAME="1013"></A><BR>Had not the wind her waving tresses show'd,
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR>And down her cheeks the melting sorrows flow'd.
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR>Her faultless form the heroe's bosom fires;
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR>The more he looks, the more he still admires.
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR>Th' admirer almost had forgot to fly,
<A NAME="1018"></A><BR>And swift descended, flutt'ring from on high.
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR>O! Virgin, worthy no such chains to prove,
<A NAME="1020"></A><BR>But pleasing chains in the soft folds of love;
<A NAME="1021"></A><BR>Thy country, and thy name (he said) disclose,
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR>And give a true rehearsal of thy woes.
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR><BR>A quick reply her bashfulness refus'd,
<A NAME="1024"></A><BR>To the free converse of a man unus'd.
<A NAME="1025"></A><BR>Her rising blushes had concealment found
<A NAME="1026"></A><BR>From her spread hands, but that her hands were bound.
<A NAME="1027"></A><BR>She acted to her full extent of pow'r,
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR>And bath'd her face with a fresh, silent show'r.
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR>But by degrees in innocence grown bold,
<A NAME="1030"></A><BR>Her name, her country, and her birth she told:
<A NAME="1031"></A><BR>And how she suffer'd for her mother's pride,
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR>Who with the Nereids once in beauty vy'd.
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR>Part yet untold, the seas began to roar,
<A NAME="1034"></A><BR>And mounting billows tumbled to the shore.
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR>Above the waves a monster rais'd his head,
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR>His body o'er the deep was widely spread:
<A NAME="1037"></A><BR>Onward he flounc'd; aloud the virgin cries;
<A NAME="1038"></A><BR>Each parent to her shrieks in shrieks replies:
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR>But she had deepest cause to rend the skies.
<A NAME="1040"></A><BR>Weeping, to her they cling; no sign appears
<A NAME="1041"></A><BR>Of help, they only lend their helpless tears.
<A NAME="1042"></A><BR>Too long you vent your sorrows, Perseus said,
<A NAME="1043"></A><BR>Short is the hour, and swift the time of aid,
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR>In me the son of thund'ring Jove behold,
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR>Got in a kindly show'r of fruitful gold.
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR>Medusa's snaky head is now my prey,
<A NAME="1047"></A><BR>And thro' the clouds I boldly wing my way.
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR>If such desert be worthy of esteem,
<A NAME="1049"></A><BR>And, if your daughter I from death redeem,
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR>Shall she be mine? Shall it not then be thought,
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR>A bride, so lovely, was too cheaply bought?
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR>For her my arms I willingly employ,
<A NAME="1053"></A><BR>If I may beauties, which I save, enjoy.
<A NAME="1054"></A><BR>The parents eagerly the terms embrace:
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR>For who would slight such terms in such a case?
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR>Nor her alone they promise, but beside,
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR>The dowry of a kingdom with the bride.
<A NAME="1058"></A><BR><BR>As well-rigg'd gallies, which slaves, sweating, 
<A NAME="1059"></A>row,
<A NAME="1060"></A><BR>With their sharp beaks the whiten'd ocean plough;
<A NAME="1061"></A><BR>So when the monster mov'd, still at his back
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR>The furrow'd waters left a foamy track.
<A NAME="1063"></A><BR>Now to the rock he was advanc'd so nigh,
<A NAME="1064"></A><BR>Whirl'd from a sling a stone the space would fly.
<A NAME="1065"></A><BR>Then bounding, upwards the brave Perseus sprung,
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR>And in mid air on hov'ring pinions hung.
<A NAME="1067"></A><BR>His shadow quickly floated on the main;
<A NAME="1068"></A><BR>The monster could not his wild rage restrain,
<A NAME="1069"></A><BR>But at the floating shadow leap'd in vain.
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR>As when Jove's bird, a speckl'd serpent spies,
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR>Which in the shine of Phoebus basking lies,
<A NAME="1072"></A><BR>Unseen, he souses down, and bears away,
<A NAME="1073"></A><BR>Truss'd from behind, the vainly-hissing prey.
<A NAME="1074"></A><BR>To writh his neck the labour nought avails,
<A NAME="1075"></A><BR>Too deep th' imperial talons pierce his scales.
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR>Thus the wing'd heroe now descends, now soars,
<A NAME="1077"></A><BR>And at his pleasure the vast monster gores.
<A NAME="1078"></A><BR>Full in his back, swift stooping from above,
<A NAME="1079"></A><BR>The crooked sabre to its hilt he drove.
<A NAME="1080"></A><BR>The monster rag'd, impatient of the pain,
<A NAME="1081"></A><BR>First bounded high, and then sunk low again.
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR>Now, like a savage boar, when chaf'd with wounds,
<A NAME="1083"></A><BR>And bay'd with opening mouths of hungry hounds,
<A NAME="1084"></A><BR>He on the foe turns with collected might,
<A NAME="1085"></A><BR>Who still eludes him with an airy flight;
<A NAME="1086"></A><BR>And wheeling round, the scaly armour tries
<A NAME="1087"></A><BR>Of his thick sides; his thinner tall now plies:
<A NAME="1088"></A><BR>'Till from repeated strokes out gush'd a flood,
<A NAME="1089"></A><BR>And the waves redden'd with the streaming blood.
<A NAME="1090"></A><BR>At last the dropping wings, befoam'd all o'er,
<A NAME="1091"></A><BR>With flaggy heaviness their master bore:
<A NAME="1092"></A><BR>A rock he spy'd, whose humble head was low,
<A NAME="1093"></A><BR>Bare at an ebb, but cover'd at a flow.
<A NAME="1094"></A><BR>A ridgy hold, he, thither flying, gain'd,
<A NAME="1095"></A><BR>And with one hand his bending weight sustain'd;
<A NAME="1096"></A><BR>With th' other, vig'rous blows he dealt around,
<A NAME="1097"></A><BR>And the home-thrusts the expiring monster own'd.
<A NAME="1098"></A><BR>In deaf'ning shouts the glad applauses rise,
<A NAME="1099"></A><BR>And peal on peal runs ratling thro' the skies.
<A NAME="1100"></A><BR>The saviour-youth the royal pair confess,
<A NAME="1101"></A><BR>And with heav'd hands their daughter's bridegroom 
<A NAME="1102"></A>bless.
<A NAME="1103"></A><BR>The beauteous bride moves on, now loos'd from chains,
<A NAME="1104"></A><BR>The cause, and sweet reward of all the heroe's pains,
<A NAME="1105"></A><BR><BR>Mean-time, on shore triumphant Perseus stood,
<A NAME="1106"></A><BR>And purg'd his hands, smear'd with the monster's 
<A NAME="1107"></A>blood:
<A NAME="1108"></A><BR>Then in the windings of a sandy bed
<A NAME="1109"></A><BR>Compos'd Medusa's execrable head.
<A NAME="1110"></A><BR>But to prevent the roughness, leafs he threw,
<A NAME="1111"></A><BR>And young, green twigs, which soft in waters grew,
<A NAME="1112"></A><BR>There soft, and full of sap; but here, when lay'd,
<A NAME="1113"></A><BR>Touch'd by the head, that softness soon decay'd.
<A NAME="1114"></A><BR>The wonted flexibility quite gone,
<A NAME="1115"></A><BR>The tender scyons harden'd into stone.
<A NAME="1116"></A><BR>Fresh, juicy twigs, surpriz'd, the Nereids brought,
<A NAME="1117"></A><BR>Fresh, juicy twigs the same contagion caught.
<A NAME="1118"></A><BR>The nymphs the petrifying seeds still keep,
<A NAME="1119"></A><BR>And propagate the wonder thro' the deep.
<A NAME="1120"></A><BR>The pliant sprays of coral yet declare
<A NAME="1121"></A><BR>Their stiff'ning Nature, when expos'd to air.
<A NAME="1122"></A><BR>Those sprays, which did, like bending osiers, move,
<A NAME="1123"></A><BR>Snatch'd from their element, obdurate prove,
<A NAME="1124"></A><BR>And shrubs beneath the waves, grow stones above.
<A NAME="1125"></A><BR><BR>The great immortals grateful Perseus prais'd,
<A NAME="1126"></A><BR>And to three Pow'rs three turfy altars rais'd.
<A NAME="1127"></A><BR>To Hermes this; and that he did assign
<A NAME="1128"></A><BR>To Pallas: the mid honours, Jove, were thine,
<A NAME="1129"></A><BR>He hastes for Pallas a white cow to cull,
<A NAME="1130"></A><BR>A calf for Hermes, but for Jove a bull.
<A NAME="1131"></A><BR>Then seiz'd the prize of his victorious fight,
<A NAME="1132"></A><BR>Andromeda, and claim'd the nuptial rite.
<A NAME="1133"></A><BR>Andromeda alone he greatly sought,
<A NAME="1134"></A><BR>The dowry kingdom was not worth his thought.
<A NAME="1135"></A><BR><BR>Pleas'd Hymen now his golden torch displays;
<A NAME="1136"></A><BR>With rich oblations fragrant altars blaze,
<A NAME="1137"></A><BR>Sweet wreaths of choicest flow'rs are hung on high,
<A NAME="1138"></A><BR>And cloudless pleasure smiles in ev'ry eye.
<A NAME="1139"></A><BR>The melting musick melting thoughts inspires,
<A NAME="1140"></A><BR>And warbling songsters aid the warbling lyres.
<A NAME="1141"></A><BR>The palace opens wide in pompous state,
<A NAME="1142"></A><BR>And by his peers surrounded, Cepheus sate.
<A NAME="1143"></A><BR>A feast was serv'd, fit for a king to give,
<A NAME="1144"></A><BR>And fit for God-like heroes to receive.
<A NAME="1145"></A><BR>The banquet ended, the gay, chearful bowl
<A NAME="1146"></A><BR>Mov'd round, and brighten'd, and enlarg'd each soul.
<A NAME="1147"></A><BR>Then Perseus ask'd, what customs there obtain'd,
<A NAME="1148"></A><BR>And by what laws the people were restrain'd.
<A NAME="1149"></A><BR>Which told; the teller a like freedom takes,
<A NAME="1150"></A><BR>And to the warrior his petition makes,
<A NAME="1151"></A><BR>To know, what arts had won Medusa's snakes.
<A NAME="1152"></A><BR><BR><B>The Story of Medusa's Head</B>
<A NAME="1153"></A><BR><BR>The heroe with his just request complies,
<A NAME="1154"></A><BR>Shows, how a vale beneath cold Atlas lies,
<A NAME="1155"></A><BR>Where, with aspiring mountains fenc'd around,
<A NAME="1156"></A><BR>He the two daughters of old Phorcus found.
<A NAME="1157"></A><BR>Fate had one common eye to both assign'd,
<A NAME="1158"></A><BR>Each saw by turns, and each by turns was blind.
<A NAME="1159"></A><BR>But while one strove to lend her sister sight,
<A NAME="1160"></A><BR>He stretch'd his hand, and stole their mutual light,
<A NAME="1161"></A><BR>And left both eyeless, both involv'd in night.
<A NAME="1162"></A><BR>Thro' devious wilds, and trackless woods he past,
<A NAME="1163"></A><BR>And at the Gorgon-seats arriv'd at last:
<A NAME="1164"></A><BR>But as he journey'd, pensive he survey'd,
<A NAME="1165"></A><BR>What wasteful havock dire Medusa made.
<A NAME="1166"></A><BR>Here, stood still breathing statues, men before;
<A NAME="1167"></A><BR>There, rampant lions seem'd in stone to roar.
<A NAME="1168"></A><BR>Nor did he, yet affrighted, quit the field,
<A NAME="1169"></A><BR>But in the mirror of his polish'd shield
<A NAME="1170"></A><BR>Reflected saw Medusa slumbers take,
<A NAME="1171"></A><BR>And not one serpent by good chance awake.
<A NAME="1172"></A><BR>Then backward an unerring blow he sped,
<A NAME="1173"></A><BR>And from her body lop'd at once her head.
<A NAME="1174"></A><BR>The gore prolifick prov'd; with sudden force
<A NAME="1175"></A><BR>Sprung Pegasus, and wing'd his airy course.
<A NAME="1176"></A><BR><BR>The Heav'n-born warrior faithfully went on,
<A NAME="1177"></A><BR>And told the num'rous dangers which he run.
<A NAME="1178"></A><BR>What subject seas, what lands he had in view,
<A NAME="1179"></A><BR>And nigh what stars th' advent'rous heroe flew.
<A NAME="1180"></A><BR>At last he silent sate; the list'ning throng
<A NAME="1181"></A><BR>Sigh'd at the pause of his delightful tongue.
<A NAME="1182"></A><BR>Some beg'd to know, why this alone should wear,
<A NAME="1183"></A><BR>Of all the sisters, such destructive hair.
<A NAME="1184"></A><BR><BR>Great Perseus then: With me you shall prevail,
<A NAME="1185"></A><BR>Worth the relation, to relate a tale.
<A NAME="1186"></A><BR>Medusa once had charms; to gain her love
<A NAME="1187"></A><BR>A rival crowd of envious lovers strove.
<A NAME="1188"></A><BR>They, who have seen her, own, they ne'er did trace
<A NAME="1189"></A><BR>More moving features in a sweeter face.
<A NAME="1190"></A><BR>Yet above all, her length of hair, they own,
<A NAME="1191"></A><BR>In golden ringlets wav'd, and graceful shone.
<A NAME="1192"></A><BR>Her Neptune saw, and with such beauties fir'd,
<A NAME="1193"></A><BR>Resolv'd to compass, what his soul desir'd.
<A NAME="1194"></A><BR>In chaste Minerva's fane, he, lustful, stay'd,
<A NAME="1195"></A><BR>And seiz'd, and rifled the young, blushing maid.
<A NAME="1196"></A><BR>The bashful Goddess turn'd her eyes away,
<A NAME="1197"></A><BR>Nor durst such bold impurity survey;
<A NAME="1198"></A><BR>But on the ravish'd virgin vengeance takes,
<A NAME="1199"></A><BR>Her shining hair is chang'd to hissing snakes.
<A NAME="1200"></A><BR>These in her Aegis Pallas joys to bear,
<A NAME="1201"></A><BR>The hissing snakes her foes more sure ensnare,
<A NAME="1202"></A><BR>Than they did lovers once, when shining hair.
