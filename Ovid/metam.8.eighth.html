<A NAME="start"></A>
<A NAME="10"></A><B>The Story of Nisus and Scylla</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>Now shone the morning star in bright array,
<A NAME="12"></A><BR>To vanquish night, and usher in the day:
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>The wind veers southward, and moist clouds arise,
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>That blot with shades the blue meridian skies.
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>Cephalus feels with joy the kindly gales,
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>His new allies unfurl the swelling sails;
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>Steady their course, they cleave the yielding main,
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>And, with a wish, th' intended harbour gain.
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>Mean-while King Minos, on the Attick strand,
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>Displays his martial skill, and wastes the land.
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>His army lies encampt upon the plains,
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>Before Alcathoe's walls, where Nisus reigns;
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>On whose grey head a lock of purple hue,
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>The strength, and fortune of his kingdom, grew.
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><BR>Six moons were gone, and past, when still from 
<A NAME="26"></A>far
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>Victoria hover'd o'er the doubtful war.
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>So long, to both inclin'd, th' impartial maid
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>Between 'em both her equal wings display'd.
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>High on the walls, by Phoebus vocal made,
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>A turret of the palace rais'd its head;
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>And where the God his tuneful harp resign'd.
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>The sound within the stones still lay enshrin'd:
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>Hither the daughter of the purple king
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>Ascended oft, to hear its musick ring;
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>And, striking with a pebble, wou'd release
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>Th' enchanted notes, in times of happy peace.
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>But now, from thence, the curious maid beheld
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>Rough feats of arms, and combats of the field:
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>And, since the siege was long, had learnt the name
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>Of ev'ry chief, his character, and fame;
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>Their arms, their horse, and quiver she descry'd,
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>Nor cou'd the dress of war the warriour hide.
<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR>Europa's son she knew above the rest,
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>And more, than well became a virgin breast:
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>In vain the crested morion veils his face,
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>She thinks it adds a more peculiar grace:
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>His ample shield, embost with burnish'd gold,
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>Still makes the bearer lovelier to behold:
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>When the tough jav'lin, with a whirl, he sends,
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>His strength and skill the sighing maid commends;
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>Or, when he strains to draw the circling bow,
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>And his fine limbs a manly posture show,
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>Compar'd with Phoebus, he performs so well,
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>Let her be judge, and Minos shall excell.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR>But when the helm put off, display'd to sight,
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>And set his features in an open light;
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>When, vaulting to his seat, his steed he prest,
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>Caparison'd in gold, and richly drest;
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>Himself in scarlet sumptuously array'd,
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>New passions rise, and fire the frantick maid.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>O happy spear! she cries, that feels his touch;
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>Nay, ev'n the reins he holds are blest too much.
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>Oh! were it lawful, she cou'd wing her way
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>Thro' the stern hostile troops without dismay;
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>Or throw her body to the distant ground,
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>And in the Cretans happy camp be found.
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>Wou'd Minos but desire it! she'd expose
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>Her native country to her country's foes;
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>Unbar the gates, the town with flames infest,
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>Or any thing that Minos shou'd request.
<A NAME="72"></A><BR><BR>And as she sate, and pleas'd her longing sight,
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>Viewing the king's pavilion veil'd with white,
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>Shou'd joy, or grief, she said, possess my breast,
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>To see my country by a war opprest?
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>I'm in suspense! For, tho' 'tis grief to know
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>I love a man that is declar'd my foe;
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>Yet, in my own despite, I must approve
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>That lucky war, which brought the man I love.
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>Yet, were I tender'd as a pledge of peace,
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>The cruelties of war might quickly cease.
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>Oh! with what joy I'd wear the chains he gave!
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>A patient hostage, and a willing slave.
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>Thou lovely object! if the nymph that bare
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>Thy charming person, were but half so fair;
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>Well might a God her virgin bloom desire,
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>And with a rape indulge his amorous fire.
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>Oh! had I wings to glide along the air,
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>To his dear tent I'd fly, and settle there:
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>There tell my quality, confess my flame,
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>And grant him any dowry that he'd name.
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>All, all I'd give; only my native land,
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>My dearest country, shou'd excepted stand,
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>For, perish love, and all expected joys,
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>E're, with so base a thought, my soul complies.
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>Yet, oft the vanquish'd some advantage find,
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>When conquer'd by a noble, gen'rous mind.
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>Brave Minos justly has the war begun,
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>Fir'd with resentment for his murder'd son:
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>The righteous Gods a righteous cause regard,
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>And will, with victory, his arms reward:
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>We must be conquer'd; and the captive's fate
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>Will surely seize us, tho' it seize us late.
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>Why then shou'd love be idle, and neglect
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>What Mars, by arms and perils, will effect?
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>Oh! Prince, I dye, with anxious fear opprest,
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>Lest some rash hand shou'd wound my charmer's breast:
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>For, if they saw, no barb'rous mind cou'd dare
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>Against that lovely form to raise a spear.
<A NAME="110"></A><BR><BR>But I'm resolv'd, and fix'd in this decree,
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>My father's country shall my dowry be.
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>Thus I prevent the loss of life and blood,
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>And, in effect, the action must be good.
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>Vain resolution! for, at ev'ry gate
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>The trusty centinels, successive, wait:
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>The keys my father keeps; ah! there's my grief;
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>'Tis he obstructs all hopes of my relief.
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>Gods! that this hated light I'd never seen!
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>Or, all my life, without a father been!
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>But Gods we all may be; for those that dare,
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>Are Gods, and Fortune's chiefest favours share.
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>The ruling Pow'rs a lazy pray'r detest,
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>The bold adventurer succeeds the best.
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>What other maid, inspir'd with such a flame,
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>But wou'd take courage, and abandon shame?
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>But wou'd, tho' ruin shou'd ensue, remove
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>Whate'er oppos'd, and clear the way to love?
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>This, shall another's feeble passion dare?
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>While I sit tame, and languish in despair:
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>No; for tho' fire and sword before me lay,
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>Impatient love thro' both shou'd force its way.
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>Yet I have no such enemies to fear,
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>My sole obstruction is my father's hair;
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>His purple lock my sanguine hope destroys,
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>And clouds the prospect of my rising joys.
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>Whilst thus she spoke, amid the thick'ning air
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>Night supervenes, the greatest nurse of care:
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>And, as the Goddess spreads her sable wings,
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>The virgin's fears decay, and courage springs.
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>The hour was come, when Man's o'er-labour'd breast
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>Surceas'd its care, by downy sleep possest:
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>All things now hush'd, Scylla with silent tread
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>Urg'd her approach to Nisus' royal bed:
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>There, of the fatal lock (accursed theft!)
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>She her unwitting father's head bereft.
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>In safe possession of her impious prey,
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>Out at a postern gate she takes her way.
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>Embolden'd, by the merit of the deed
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>She traverses the adverse camp with speed,
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>'Till Minos' tent she reach'd: the righteous king
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>She thus bespoke, who shiver'd at the thing.
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR>Behold th' effect of love's resistless sway!
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>I, Nisus' royal seed, to thee betray
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>My country, and my Gods. For this strange task,
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>Minos, no other boon but thee I ask.
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>This purple lock, a pledge of love, receive;
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>No worthless present, since in it I give
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>My father's head.- Mov'd at a crime so new,
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>And with abhorrence fill'd, back Minos drew,
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>Nor touch'd th' unhallow'd gift; but thus exclaim'd
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>(With mein indignant, and with eyes inflam'd),
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>Perdition seize thee, thou, thy kind's disgrace!
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>May thy devoted carcass find no place
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>In earth, or air, or sea, by all out-cast!
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>Shall Minos, with so foul a monster, blast
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>His Cretan world, where cradled Jove was nurst?
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>Forbid it Heav'n!- away, thou most accurst!
<A NAME="168"></A><BR><BR>And now Alcathoe, its lord exchang'd,
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>Was under Minos' domination rang'd.
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>While the most equal king his care applies
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>To curb the conquer'd, and new laws devise,
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>The fleet, by his command, with hoisted sails,
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>And ready oars, invites the murm'ring gales.
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>At length the Cretan hero anchor weigh'd,
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>Repaying, with neglect, th' abandon'd maid.
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>Deaf to her cries, he furrows up the main:
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>In vain she prays, sollicits him in vain.
<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR>And now she furious grows in wild despair,
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>She wrings her hands, and throws aloft her hair.
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>Where run'st thou? (thus she vents her deep distress)
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>Why shun'st thou her that crown'd thee with success?
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>Her, whose fond love to thee cou'd sacrifice
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>Her country, and her parent, sacred ties!
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>Can nor my love, nor proffer'd presents find
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>A passage to thy heart, and make thee kind?
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>Can nothing move thy pity? O ingrate,
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>Can'st thou behold my lost, forlorn estate,
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>And not be soften'd? Can'st thou throw off one
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>Who has no refuge left but thee alone?
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>Where shall I seek for comfort? whither fly?
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>My native country does in ashes lye:
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>Or were't not so, my treason bars me there,
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>And bids me wander. Shall I next repair
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>To a wrong'd father, by my guilt undone?-
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>Me all Mankind deservedly will shun.
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>I, out of all the world, my self have thrown,
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>To purchase an access to Crete alone;
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>Which, since refus'd, ungen'rous man, give o'er
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>To boast thy race; Europa never bore
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>A thing so savage. Thee some tygress bred,
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>On the bleak Syrt's inhospitable bed;
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>Or where Charybdis pours its rapid tide
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>Tempestuous. Thou art not to Jove ally'd;
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>Nor did the king of Gods thy mother meet
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>Beneath a bull's forg'd shape, and bear to Crete.
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>That fable of thy glorious birth is feign'd;
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>Some wild outrageous bull thy dam sustain'd.
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>O father Nisus, now my death behold;
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>Exult, o city, by my baseness sold:
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>Minos, obdurate, has aveng'd ye all;
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>But 'twere more just by those I wrong'd to fall:
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>For why shou'dst thou, who only didst subdue
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>By my offending, my offence pursue?
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>Well art thou matcht to one whose am'rous flame
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>Too fiercely rag'd, for human-kind to tame;
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>One who, within a wooden heifer thrust,
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>Courted a low'ring bull's mistaken lust;
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>And, from whose monster-teeming womb, the Earth
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>Receiv'd, what much it mourn'd, a bi-form birth.
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>But what avails my plaints? the whistling wind,
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>Which bears him far away, leaves them behind.
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>Well weigh'd Pasiphae, when she prefer'd
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>A bull to thee, more brutish than the herd.
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>But ah! Time presses, and the labour'd oars
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>To distance drive the fleet, and lose the less'ning 
<A NAME="226"></A>shores.
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>Think not, ungrateful man, the liquid way
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>And threat'ning billows shall inforce my stay.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>I'll follow thee in spite: My arms I'll throw
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>Around thy oars, or grasp thy crooked prow,
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>And drag thro' drenching seas. Her eager tongue
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>Had hardly clos'd the speech, when forth she sprung
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>And prov'd the deep. Cupid with added force
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>Recruits each nerve, and aids her wat'ry course.
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>Soon she the ship attains, unwelcome guest;
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>And, as with close embrace its sides she prest,
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>A hawk from upper air came pouring down
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>('Twas Nisus cleft the sky with wings new grown).
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>At Scylla's head his horny bill he aims;
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>She, fearful of the blow, the ship disclaims,
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>Quitting her hold: and yet she fell not far,
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>But wond'ring, finds her self sustain'd in air.
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>Chang'd to a lark, she mottled pinions shook,
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>And, from the ravish'd lock, the name of Ciris took.
<A NAME="245"></A><BR><BR><B>The Labyrinth</B>
<A NAME="246"></A><BR><BR>Now Minos, landed on the Cretan shore,
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>Performs his vows to Jove's protecting pow'r;
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>A hundred bullocks of the largest breed,
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>With flowrets crown'd, before his altar bleed:
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>While trophies of the vanquish'd, brought from far
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>Adorn the palace with the spoils of war.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR>Mean-while the monster of a human-beast,
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>His family's reproach, and stain, increas'd.
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>His double kind the rumour swiftly spread,
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>And evidenc'd the mother's beastly deed.
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>When Minos, willing to conceal the shame
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>That sprung from the reports of tatling Fame,
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>Resolves a dark inclosure to provide,
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>And, far from sight, the two-form'd creature hide.
<A NAME="260"></A><BR><BR>Great Daedalus of Athens was the man
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>That made the draught, and form'd the wondrous plan;
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>Where rooms within themselves encircled lye,
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>With various windings, to deceive the eye.
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>As soft Maeander's wanton current plays,
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>When thro' the Phrygian fields it loosely strays;
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>Backward and forward rouls the dimpl'd tide,
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>Seeming, at once, two different ways to glide:
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>While circling streams their former banks survey,
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>And waters past succeeding waters see:
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>Now floating to the sea with downward course,
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>Now pointing upward to its ancient source,
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>Such was the work, so intricate the place,
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>That scarce the workman all its turns cou'd trace;
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>And Daedalus was puzzled how to find
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>The secret ways of what himself design'd.
<A NAME="276"></A><BR><BR>These private walls the Minotaur include,
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>Who twice was glutted with Athenian blood:
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>But the third tribute more successful prov'd,
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>Slew the foul monster, and the plague remov'd.
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>When Theseus, aided by the virgin's art,
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>Had trac'd the guiding thread thro' ev'ry part,
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>He took the gentle maid, that set him free,
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>And, bound for Dias, cut the briny sea.
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>There, quickly cloy'd, ungrateful, and unkind,
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>Left his fair consort in the isle behind,
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>Whom Bacchus saw, and straining in his arms
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>Her rifled bloom, and violated charms,
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>Resolves, for this, the dear engaging dame
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>Shou'd shine for ever in the rolls of Fame;
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>And bids her crown among the stars be plac'd,
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>With an eternal constellation grac'd.
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>The golden circlet mounts; and, as it flies,
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>Its diamonds twinkle in the distant skies;
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>There, in their pristin form, the gemmy rays
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>Between Alcides, and the dragon blaze.
<A NAME="296"></A><BR><BR><B>The Story of Daedalus and Icarus</B>
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR>In tedious exile now too long detain'd,
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>Daedalus languish'd for his native land:
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>The sea foreclos'd his flight; yet thus he said:
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>Tho' Earth and water in subjection laid,
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>O cruel Minos, thy dominion be,
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>We'll go thro' air; for sure the air is free.
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>Then to new arts his cunning thought applies,
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>And to improve the work of Nature tries.
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>A row of quils in gradual order plac'd,
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>Rise by degrees in length from first to last;
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>As on a cliff th' ascending thicket grows,
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>Or, different reeds the rural pipe compose.
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>Along the middle runs a twine of flax,
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>The bottom stems are joyn'd by pliant wax.
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>Thus, well compact, a hollow bending brings
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>The fine composure into real wings.
<A NAME="313"></A><BR><BR>His boy, young Icarus, that near him stood,
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>Unthinking of his fate, with smiles pursu'd
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>The floating feathers, which the moving air
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>Bore loosely from the ground, and wasted here and 
<A NAME="317"></A>there.
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>Or with the wax impertinently play'd,
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>And with his childish tricks the great design delay'd.
<A NAME="320"></A><BR><BR>The final master-stroke at last impos'd,
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>And now, the neat machine compleatly clos'd;
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>Fitting his pinions on, a flight he tries,
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>And hung self-ballanc'd in the beaten skies.
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>Then thus instructs his child: My boy, take care
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>To wing your course along the middle air;
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>If low, the surges wet your flagging plumes;
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>If high, the sun the melting wax consumes:
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>Steer between both: nor to the northern skies,
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>Nor south Orion turn your giddy eyes;
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>But follow me: let me before you lay
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>Rules for the flight, and mark the pathless way.
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>Then teaching, with a fond concern, his son,
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>He took the untry'd wings, and fix'd 'em on;
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>But fix'd with trembling hands; and as he speaks,
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>The tears roul gently down his aged cheeks.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>Then kiss'd, and in his arms embrac'd him fast,
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>But knew not this embrace must be the last.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>And mounting upward, as he wings his flight,
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>Back on his charge he turns his aking sight;
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>As parent birds, when first their callow care
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>Leave the high nest to tempt the liquid air.
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>Then chears him on, and oft, with fatal art,
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>Reminds the stripling to perform his part.
<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR>These, as the angler at the silent brook,
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>Or mountain-shepherd leaning on his crook,
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>Or gaping plowman, from the vale descries,
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>They stare, and view 'em with religious eyes,
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>And strait conclude 'em Gods; since none, but they,
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>Thro' their own azure skies cou'd find a way.
<A NAME="350"></A><BR><BR>Now Delos, Paros on the left are seen,
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>And Samos, favour'd by Jove's haughty queen;
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>Upon the right, the isle Lebynthos nam'd,
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>And fair Calymne for its honey fam'd.
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>When now the boy, whose childish thoughts aspire
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>To loftier aims, and make him ramble high'r,
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>Grown wild, and wanton, more embolden'd flies
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>Far from his guide, and soars among the skies.
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>The soft'ning wax, that felt a nearer sun,
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>Dissolv'd apace, and soon began to run.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>The youth in vain his melting pinions shakes,
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>His feathers gone, no longer air he takes:
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>Oh! Father, father, as he strove to cry,
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>Down to the sea he tumbled from on high,
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>And found his Fate; yet still subsists by fame,
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>Among those waters that retain his name.
<A NAME="366"></A><BR><BR>The father, now no more a father, cries,
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>Ho Icarus! where are you? as he flies;
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>Where shall I seek my boy? he cries again,
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>And saw his feathers scatter'd on the main.
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>Then curs'd his art; and fun'ral rites confer'd,
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>Naming the country from the youth interr'd.
<A NAME="372"></A><BR><BR>A partridge, from a neighb'ring stump, beheld
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>The sire his monumental marble build;
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>Who, with peculiar call, and flutt'ring wing,
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>Chirpt joyful, and malicious seem'd to sing:
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>The only bird of all its kind, and late
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>Transform'd in pity to a feather'd state:
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>From whence, O Daedalus, thy guilt we date.
<A NAME="379"></A><BR><BR>His sister's son, when now twelve years were 
<A NAME="380"></A>past,
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>Was, with his uncle, as a scholar plac'd;
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>The unsuspecting mother saw his parts,
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>And genius fitted for the finest arts.
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>This soon appear'd; for when the spiny bone
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>In fishes' backs was by the stripling known,
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>A rare invention thence he learnt to draw,
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>Fil'd teeth in ir'n, and made the grating saw.
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>He was the first, that from a knob of brass
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>Made two strait arms with widening stretch to pass;
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>That, while one stood upon the center's place,
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>The other round it drew a circling space.
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>Daedalus envy'd this, and from the top
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>Of fair Minerva's temple let him drop;
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>Feigning, that, as he lean'd upon the tow'r,
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>Careless he stoop'd too much, and tumbled o'er.
<A NAME="396"></A><BR><BR>The Goddess, who th' ingenious still befriends,
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>On this occasion her asssistance lends;
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>His arms with feathers, as he fell, she veils,
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>And in the air a new made bird he sails.
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>The quickness of his genius, once so fleet,
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>Still in his wings remains, and in his feet:
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>Still, tho' transform'd, his ancient name he keeps,
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>And with low flight the new-shorn stubble sweeps,
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>Declines the lofty trees, and thinks it best
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>To brood in hedge-rows o'er its humble nest;
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>And, in remembrance of the former ill,
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>Avoids the heights, and precipices still.
<A NAME="408"></A><BR><BR>At length, fatigu'd with long laborious flights,
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>On fair Sicilia's plains the artist lights;
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>Where Cocalus the king, that gave him aid,
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>Was, for his kindness, with esteem repaid.
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>Athens no more her doleful tribute sent,
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>That hardship gallant Theseus did prevent;
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>Their temples hung with garlands, they adore
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>Each friendly God, but most Minerva's pow'r:
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>To her, to Jove, to all, their altars smoak,
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>They each with victims, and perfumes invoke.
<A NAME="418"></A><BR><BR>Now talking Fame, thro' every Grecian town,
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>Had spread, immortal Theseus, thy renown.
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>From him the neighb'ring nations in distress,
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>In suppliant terms implore a kind redress.
<A NAME="422"></A><BR><BR><B>The Story of Meleager and Atalanta</B>
<A NAME="423"></A><BR><BR>From him the Caledonians sought relief;
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>Though valiant Meleagros was their chief.
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>The cause, a boar, who ravag'd far and near:
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>Of Cynthia's wrath, th' avenging minister.
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>For Oeneus with autumnal plenty bless'd,
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>By gifts to Heav'n his gratitude express'd:
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>Cull'd sheafs, to Ceres; to Lyaeus, wine;
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>To Pan, and Pales, offer'd sheep and kine;
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>And fat of olives, to Minerva's shrine.
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>Beginning from the rural Gods, his hand
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>Was lib'ral to the Pow'rs of high command:
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>Each deity in ev'ry kind was bless'd,
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>'Till at Diana's fane th' invidious honour ceas'd.
<A NAME="436"></A><BR><BR>Wrath touches ev'n the Gods; the Queen of Night,
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>Fir'd with disdain, and jealous of her right,
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>Unhonour'd though I am, at least, said she,
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>Not unreveng'd that impious act shall be.
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>Swift as the word, she sped the boar away,
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>With charge on those devoted fields to prey.
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>No larger bulls th' Aegyptian pastures feed,
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>And none so large Sicilian meadows breed:
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>His eye-balls glare with fire suffus'd with blood;
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>His neck shoots up a thick-set thorny wood;
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>His bristled back a trench impal'd appears,
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>And stands erected, like a field of spears;
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>Froth fills his chaps, he sends a grunting sound,
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>And part he churns, and part befoams the ground,
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>For tusks with Indian elephants he strove,
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>And Jove's own thunder from his mouth he drove.
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>He burns the leaves; the scorching blast invades
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>The tender corn, and shrivels up the blades:
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>Or suff'ring not their yellow beards to rear,
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>He tramples down the spikes, and intercepts the 
<A NAME="456"></A>year:
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>In vain the barns expect their promis'd load,
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>Nor barns at home, nor recks are heap'd abroad:
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>In vain the hinds the threshing-floor prepare,
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>And exercise their flail in empty air.
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>With olives ever-green the ground is strow'd,
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>And grapes ungather'd shed their gen'rous blood.
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>Amid the fold he rages, nor the sheep
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>Their shepherds, nor the grooms their bulls can 
<A NAME="465"></A>keep.
<A NAME="466"></A><BR><BR>From fields to walls the frighted rabble run,
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>Nor think themselves secure within the town:
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>'Till Meleagros, and his chosen crew,
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>Contemn the danger, and the praise pursue.
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>Fair Leda's twins (in time to stars decreed)
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>One fought on foot, one curb'd the fiery steed;
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>Then issu'd forth fam'd Jason after these,
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>Who mann'd the foremost ship that sail'd the seas;
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>Then Theseus join'd with bold Perithous came;
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>A single concord in a double name:
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>The Thestian sons, Idas who swiftly ran,
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>And Ceneus, once a woman, now a man.
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>Lynceus, with eagle's eyes, and lion's heart;
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>Leucippus, with his never-erring dart;
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>Acastus, Phileus, Phoenix, Telamon,
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>Echion, Lelix, and Eurytion,
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>Achilles' father, and great Phocus' son;
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>Dryas the fierce, and Hippasus the strong;
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>With twice old Iolas, and Nestor then but young.
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>Laertes active, and Ancaeus bold;
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>Mopsus the sage, who future things foretold;
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>And t' other seer, yet by his wife unsold.
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>A thousand others of immortal fame;
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>Among the rest, fair Atalanta came,
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>Grace of the woods: a diamond buckle bound
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>Her vest behind, that else had flow'd upon the ground,
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>And shew'd her buskin'd legs; her head was bare,
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>But for her native ornament of hair;
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>Which in a simple knot was ty'd above,
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>Sweet negligence! unheeded bait of love!
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>Her sounding quiver, on her shoulder ty'd,
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>One hand a dart, and one a bow supply'd.
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>Such was her face, as in a nymph display'd
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>A fair fierce boy, or in a boy betray'd
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>The blushing beauties of a modest maid.
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>The Caledonian chief at once the dame
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>Beheld, at once his heart receiv'd the flame,
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>With Heav'ns averse. O happy youth, he cry'd;
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>For whom thy fates reserve so fair a bride!
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>He sigh'd, and had no leisure more to say;
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>His honour call'd his eyes another way,
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>And forc'd him to pursue the now-neglected prey.
<A NAME="508"></A><BR><BR>There stood a forest on a mountain's brow,
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>Which over-look'd the shaded plains below.
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>No sounding ax presum'd those trees to bite;
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>Coeval with the world, a venerable sight.
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>The heroes there arriv'd, some spread around
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>The toils; some search the footsteps on the ground:
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>Some from the chains the faithful dogs unbound.
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>Of action eager, and intent in thought,
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>The chiefs their honourable danger sought:
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>A valley stood below; the common drain
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>Of waters from above, and falling rain:
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>The bottom was a moist, and marshy ground,
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>Whose edges were with bending oziers crown'd:
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>The knotty bulrush next in order stood,
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>And all within of reeds a trembling wood.
<A NAME="523"></A><BR><BR>From hence the boar was rous'd, and sprung amain,
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>Like lightning sudden, on the warrior train;
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>Beats down the trees before him, shakes the ground.
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>The forest echoes to the crackling sound;
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>Shout the fierce youth, and clamours ring around.
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>All stood with their protended spears prepar'd,
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>With broad steel heads the brandish'd weapons glar'd.
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>The beast impetuous with his tusks aside
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>Deals glancing wounds; the fearful dogs divide:
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>All spend their mouths aloof, but none abide.
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>Echion threw the first, but miss'd his mark,
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>And stuck his boar-spear on a maple's bark.
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>Then Jason; and his javelin seem'd to take,
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>But fail'd with over-force, and whiz'd above his 
<A NAME="537"></A>back.
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>Mopsus was next; but e'er he threw, address'd
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>To Phoebus, thus: O patron, help thy priest:
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>If I adore, and ever have ador'd
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>Thy pow'r divine, thy present aid afford;
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>That I may reach the beast. The God allow'd
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>His pray'r, and smiling, gave him what he cou'd:
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>He reach'd the savage, but no blood he drew:
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>Dian unarm'd the javelin, as it flew.
<A NAME="546"></A><BR><BR>This chaf'd the boar, his nostrils flames expire,
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>And his red eye-balls roul with living fire.
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>Whirl'd from a sling, or from an engine thrown,
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>Amid the foes, so flies a mighty stone,
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>As flew the beast: the left wing put to flight,
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>The chiefs o'er-born, he rushes on the right.
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>Eupalamos and Pelagon he laid
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>In dust, and next to death, but for their fellows' 
<A NAME="554"></A>aid.
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>Onesimus far'd worse, prepar'd to fly,
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>The fatal fang drove deep within his thigh,
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>And cut the nerves: the nerves no more sustain
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>The bulk; the bulk unprop'd, falls headlong on the 
<A NAME="559"></A>plain.
<A NAME="560"></A><BR><BR>Nestor had fail'd the fall of Troy to see,
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>But leaning on his lance, he vaulted on a tree;
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>Then gath'ring up his feet, look'd down with fear,
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>And thought his monstrous foe was still too near.
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>Against a stump his tusk the monster grinds,
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>And in the sharpen'd edge new vigour finds;
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>Then, trusting to his arms, young Othrys found,
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>And ranch'd his hips with one continu'd wound.
<A NAME="568"></A><BR><BR>Now Leda's twins, the future stars, appear;
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>White were their habits, white their horses were:
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>Conspicuous both, and both in act to throw,
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>Their trembling lances brandish'd at the foe:
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>Nor had they miss'd; but he to thickets fled,
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>Conceal'd from aiming spears, not pervious to the 
<A NAME="574"></A>steed.
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>But Telamon rush'd in, and happ'd to meet
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>A rising root, that held his fastned feet;
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>So down he fell, whom, sprawling on the ground,
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>His brother from the wooden gyves unbound.
<A NAME="579"></A><BR><BR>Mean-time the virgin-huntress was not slow
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>T' expel the shaft from her contracted bow:
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>Beneath his ear the fastned arrow stood,
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>And from the wound appear'd the trickling blood.
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>She blush'd for joy: but Meleagros rais'd
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>His voice with loud applause, and the fair archer 
<A NAME="585"></A>prais'd.
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>He was the first to see, and first to show
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>His friends the marks of the successful blow.
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>Nor shall thy valour want the praises due,
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>He said; a virtuous envy seiz'd the crew.
<A NAME="590"></A><BR>They shout; the shouting animates their hearts,
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>And all at once employ their thronging darts:
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>But out of order thrown, in air they joyn,
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>And multitude makes frustrate the design.
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>With both his hands the proud Ancaeus takes,
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>And flourishes his double-biting ax:
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>Then, forward to his fate, he took a stride
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>Before the rest, and to his fellows cry'd,
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>Give place, and mark the diff'rence, if you can,
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>Between a woman warrior, and a man,
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>The boar is doom'd; nor though Diana lend
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>Her aid, Diana can her beast defend.
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>Thus boasted he; then stretch'd, on tiptoe stood,
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>Secure to make his empty promise good.
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>But the more wary beast prevents the blow,
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>And upward rips the groin of his audacious foe.
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>Ancaeus falls; his bowels from the wound
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>Rush out, and clotted blood distains the ground.
<A NAME="608"></A><BR><BR>Perithous, no small portion of the war,
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>Press'd on, and shook his lance: to whom from far
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>Thus Theseus cry'd; O stay, my better part,
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>My more than mistress; of my heart, the heart.
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>The strong may fight aloof; Ancaeus try'd
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>His force too near, and by presuming dy'd:
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>He said, and while he spake his javelin threw,
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>Hissing in air th' unerring weapon flew;
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>But on an arm of oak, that stood betwixt
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>The marks-man and the mark, his lance he fixt.
<A NAME="618"></A><BR><BR>Once more bold Jason threw, but fail'd to wound
<A NAME="619"></A><BR>The boar, and slew an undeserving hound,
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>And thro' the dog the dart was nail'd to ground.
<A NAME="621"></A><BR><BR>Two spears from Meleager's hand were sent,
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>With equal force, but various in th' event:
<A NAME="623"></A><BR>The first was fix'd in earth, the second stood
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>On the boar's bristled back, and deeply drank his 
<A NAME="625"></A>blood.
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>Now while the tortur'd savage turns around,
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>And flings about his foam, impatient of the wound,
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>The wound's great author close at hand provokes
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>His rage, and plies him with redoubled strokes;
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>Wheels, as he wheels; and with his pointed dart
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>Explores the nearest passage to his heart.
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>Quick, and more quick he spins in giddy gires,
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>Then falls, and in much foam his soul expires.
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>This act with shouts heav'n-high the friendly band
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>Applaud, and strain in theirs the victor's hand.
<A NAME="636"></A><BR>Then all approach the slain with vast surprize,
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>Admire on what a breadth of earth he lies,
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>And scarce secure, reach out their spears afar,
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>And blood their points, to prove their partnership of 
<A NAME="640"></A>war.
<A NAME="641"></A><BR><BR>But he, the conqu'ring chief, his foot impress'd
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>On the strong neck of that destructive beast;
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>And gazing on the nymph with ardent eyes,
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>Accept, said he, fair Nonacrine, my prize,
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>And, though inferior, suffer me to join
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>My labours, and my part of praise, with thine:
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>At this presents her with the tusky head
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>And chine, with rising bristles roughly spread.
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>Glad she receiv'd the gift; and seem'd to take
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>With double pleasure, for the giver's sake.
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>The rest were seiz'd with sullen discontent,
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>And a deaf murmur through the squadron went:
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>All envy'd; but the Thestyan brethren show'd
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>The least respect, and thus they vent their spleen 
<A NAME="655"></A>aloud:
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>Lay down those honour'd spoils, nor think to share,
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>Weak woman as thou art, the prize of war:
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>Ours is the title, thine a foreign claim,
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>Since Meleagrus from our lineage came.
<A NAME="660"></A><BR>Trust not thy beauty; but restore the prize,
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>Which he, besotted on that face, and eyes,
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>Would rend from us: at this, enflam'd with spite,
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>From her they snatch the gift, from him the giver's 
<A NAME="664"></A>right.
<A NAME="665"></A><BR><BR>But soon th' impatient prince his fauchion drew,
<A NAME="666"></A><BR>And cry'd, Ye robbers of another's due,
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>Now learn the diff'rence, at your proper cost,
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>Betwixt true valour, and an empty boast.
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>At this advanc'd, and sudden as the word,
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>In proud Plexippus' bosom plung'd the sword:
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>Toxeus amaz'd, and with amazement slow,
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>Or to revenge, or ward the coming blow,
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>Stood doubting; and while doubting thus he stood,
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>Receiv'd the steel bath'd in his brother's blood.
<A NAME="675"></A><BR><BR>Pleas'd with the first, unknown the second news;
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>Althaea to the temples pays their dues
<A NAME="677"></A><BR>For her son's conquest; when at length appear
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>Her grisly brethren stretch'd upon the bier:
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>Pale at the sudden sight, she chang'd her cheer,
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>And with her cheer her robes; but hearing tell
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>The cause, the manner, and by whom they fell,
<A NAME="682"></A><BR>'Twas grief no more, or grief and rage were one
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>Within her soul; at last 'twas rage alone;
<A NAME="684"></A><BR>Which burning upwards in succession, dries
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>The tears, that stood consid'ring in her eyes.
<A NAME="686"></A><BR><BR>There lay a log unlighted on the hearth,
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>When she was lab'ring in the throws of birth
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>For th' unborn chief; the fatal sisters came,
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>And rais'd it up, and toss'd it on the flame:
<A NAME="690"></A><BR>Then on the rock a scanty measure place
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>Of vital flax, and turn'd the wheel apace;
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>And turning sung, To this red brand and thee,
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>O new born babe, we give an equal destiny;
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>So vanish'd out of view. The frighted dame
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>Sprung hasty from her bed, and quench'd the flame:
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>The log, in secret lock'd, she kept with care,
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>And that, while thus preserv'd, preserv'd her heir.
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>This brand she now produc'd; and first she strows
<A NAME="699"></A><BR>The hearth with heaps of chips, and after blows;
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>Thrice heav'd her hand, and heav'd, she thrice repress'd:
<A NAME="701"></A><BR>The sister and the mother long contest,
<A NAME="702"></A><BR>Two doubtful titles, in one tender breast:
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>And now her eyes, and cheeks with fury glow,
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>Now pale her cheeks, her eyes with pity flow:
<A NAME="705"></A><BR>Now low'ring looks presage approaching storms,
<A NAME="706"></A><BR>And now prevailing love her face reforms:
<A NAME="707"></A><BR>Resolv'd, she doubts again; the tears she dry'd
<A NAME="708"></A><BR>With burning rage, are by new tears supply'd;
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>And as a ship, which winds and waves assail
<A NAME="710"></A><BR>Now with the current drives, now with the gale,
<A NAME="711"></A><BR>Both opposite, and neither long prevail:
<A NAME="712"></A><BR>She feels a double force, by turns obeys
<A NAME="713"></A><BR>Th' imperious tempest, and th' impetuous seas:
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>So fares Althaea's mind, she first relents
<A NAME="715"></A><BR>With pity, of that pity then repents:
<A NAME="716"></A><BR>Sister, and mother long the scales divide,
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>But the beam nodded on the sister's side.
<A NAME="718"></A><BR>Sometimes she softly sigh'd, then roar'd aloud;
<A NAME="719"></A><BR>But sighs were stifled in the cries of blood.
<A NAME="720"></A><BR><BR>The pious, impious wretch at length decreed,
<A NAME="721"></A><BR>To please her brothers' ghost, her son should bleed:
<A NAME="722"></A><BR>And when the fun'ral flames began to rise,
<A NAME="723"></A><BR>Receive, she said, a sister's sacrifice;
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>A mother's bowels burn: high in her hand,
<A NAME="725"></A><BR>Thus while she spoke, she held the fatal brand;
<A NAME="726"></A><BR>Then thrice before the kindled pile she bow'd,
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>And the three Furies thrice invok'd aloud:
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>Come, come, revenging sisters, come, and view
<A NAME="729"></A><BR>A sister paying her dead brothers due:
<A NAME="730"></A><BR>A crime I punish, and a crime commit;
<A NAME="731"></A><BR>But blood for blood, and death for death is fit:
<A NAME="732"></A><BR>Great crimes must be with greater crimes repaid,
<A NAME="733"></A><BR>And second fun'rals on the former laid.
<A NAME="734"></A><BR>Let the whole houshold in one ruin fall,
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>And may Diana's curse o'ertake us all.
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>Shall Fate to happy Oenus still allow
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>One son, while Thestius stands depriv'd of two?
<A NAME="738"></A><BR>Better three lost, than one unpunish'd go.
<A NAME="739"></A><BR>Take then, dear ghosts (while yet admitted new
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>In Hell you wait my duty), take your due:
<A NAME="741"></A><BR>A costly off'ring on your tomb is laid,
<A NAME="742"></A><BR>When with my blood the price of yours is paid.
<A NAME="743"></A><BR><BR>Ah! whither am I hurry'd? Ah! forgive,
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>Ye shades, and let your sister's issue live;
<A NAME="745"></A><BR>A mother cannot give him death; tho' he
<A NAME="746"></A><BR>Deserves it, he deserves it not from me.
<A NAME="747"></A><BR><BR>Then shall th' unpunish'd wretch insult the 
<A NAME="748"></A>slain,
<A NAME="749"></A><BR>Triumphant live, nor only live, but reign?
<A NAME="750"></A><BR>While you, thin shades, the sport of winds, are 
<A NAME="751"></A>tost
<A NAME="752"></A><BR>O'er dreary plains, or tread the burning coast.
<A NAME="753"></A><BR>I cannot, cannot bear; 'tis past, 'tis done;
<A NAME="754"></A><BR>Perish this impious, this detested son:
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>Perish his sire, and perish I withal;
<A NAME="756"></A><BR>And let the house's heir, and the hop'd kingdom 
<A NAME="757"></A>fall.
<A NAME="758"></A><BR><BR>Where is the mother fled, her pious love,
<A NAME="759"></A><BR>And where the pains with which ten months I strove!
<A NAME="760"></A><BR>Ah! had'st thou dy'd, my son, in infant years,
<A NAME="761"></A><BR>Thy little herse had been bedew'd with tears.
<A NAME="762"></A><BR><BR>Thou liv'st by me; to me thy breath resign;
<A NAME="763"></A><BR>Mine is the merit, the demerit thine.
<A NAME="764"></A><BR>Thy life by double title I require;
<A NAME="765"></A><BR>Once giv'n at birth, and once preserv'd from fire:
<A NAME="766"></A><BR>One murder pay, or add one murder more,
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>And me to them who fell by thee restore.
<A NAME="768"></A><BR><BR>I would, but cannot: my son's image stands
<A NAME="769"></A><BR>Before my sight; and now their angry hands
<A NAME="770"></A><BR>My brothers hold, and vengeance these exact;
<A NAME="771"></A><BR>This pleads compassion, and repents the fact.
<A NAME="772"></A><BR><BR>He pleads in vain, and I pronounce his doom:
<A NAME="773"></A><BR>My brothers, though unjustly, shall o'ercome.
<A NAME="774"></A><BR>But having paid their injur'd ghosts their due,
<A NAME="775"></A><BR>My son requires my death, and mine shall his pursue.
<A NAME="776"></A><BR><BR>At this, for the last time, she lifts her hand,
<A NAME="777"></A><BR>Averts her eyes, and, half unwilling, drops the 
<A NAME="778"></A>brand.
<A NAME="779"></A><BR>The brand, amid the flaming fewel thrown,
<A NAME="780"></A><BR>Or drew, or seem'd to draw, a dying groan;
<A NAME="781"></A><BR>The fires themselves but faintly lick'd their prey,
<A NAME="782"></A><BR>Then loath'd their impious food, and would have shrunk 
<A NAME="783"></A>away.
<A NAME="784"></A><BR><BR>Just then the heroe cast a doleful cry,
<A NAME="785"></A><BR>And in those absent flames began to fry:
<A NAME="786"></A><BR>The blind contagion rag'd within his veins;
<A NAME="787"></A><BR>But he with manly patience bore his pains:
<A NAME="788"></A><BR>He fear'd not Fate, but only griev'd to die
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>Without an honest wound, and by a death so dry.
<A NAME="790"></A><BR>Happy Ancaeus, thrice aloud he cry'd,
<A NAME="791"></A><BR>With what becoming fate in arms he dy'd!
<A NAME="792"></A><BR>Then call'd his brothers, sisters, sire around,
<A NAME="793"></A><BR>And, her to whom his nuptial vows were bound,
<A NAME="794"></A><BR>Perhaps his mother; a long sigh she drew,
<A NAME="795"></A><BR>And his voice failing, took his last adieu.
<A NAME="796"></A><BR>For as the flames augment, and as they stay
<A NAME="797"></A><BR>At their full height, then languish to decay,
<A NAME="798"></A><BR>They rise and sink by fits; at last they soar
<A NAME="799"></A><BR>In one bright blaze, and then descend no more:
<A NAME="800"></A><BR>Just so his inward heats, at height, impair,
<A NAME="801"></A><BR>'Till the last burning breath shoots out the soul in 
<A NAME="802"></A>air.
<A NAME="803"></A><BR><BR>Now lofty Calidon in ruins lies;
<A NAME="804"></A><BR>All ages, all degrees unsluice their eyes,
<A NAME="805"></A><BR>And Heav'n, and Earth resound with murmurs, groans, and 
<A NAME="806"></A>cries.
<A NAME="807"></A><BR>Matrons and maidens beat their breasts, and tear
<A NAME="808"></A><BR>Their habits, and root up their scatter'd hair:
<A NAME="809"></A><BR>The wretched father, father now no more,
<A NAME="810"></A><BR>With sorrow sunk, lies prostrate on the floor,
<A NAME="811"></A><BR>Deforms his hoary locks with dust obscene,
<A NAME="812"></A><BR>And curses age, and loaths a life prolong'd with 
<A NAME="813"></A>pain.
<A NAME="814"></A><BR>By steel her stubborn soul his mother freed,
<A NAME="815"></A><BR>And punish'd on her self her impious deed.
<A NAME="816"></A><BR><BR>Had I a hundred tongues, a wit so large
<A NAME="817"></A><BR>As could their hundred offices discharge;
<A NAME="818"></A><BR>Had Phoebus all his Helicon bestow'd
<A NAME="819"></A><BR>In all the streams, inspiring all the God;
<A NAME="820"></A><BR>Those tongues, that wit, those streams, that God in 
<A NAME="821"></A>vain
<A NAME="822"></A><BR>Would offer to describe his sisters' pain:
<A NAME="823"></A><BR>They beat their breasts with many a bruizing blow,
<A NAME="824"></A><BR>'Till they turn livid, and corrupt the snow.
<A NAME="825"></A><BR>The corps they cherish, while the corps remains,
<A NAME="826"></A><BR>And exercise, and rub with fruitless pains;
<A NAME="827"></A><BR>And when to fun'ral flames 'tis born away,
<A NAME="828"></A><BR>They kiss the bed on which the body lay:
<A NAME="829"></A><BR>And when those fun'ral flames no longer burn
<A NAME="830"></A><BR>(The dust compos'd within a pious urn),
<A NAME="831"></A><BR>Ev'n in that urn their brother they confess,
<A NAME="832"></A><BR>And hug it in their arms, and to their bosoms press.
<A NAME="833"></A><BR><BR>His tomb is rais'd; then, stretch'd along the 
<A NAME="834"></A>ground,
<A NAME="835"></A><BR>Those living monuments his tomb surround:
<A NAME="836"></A><BR>Ev'n to his name, inscrib'd, their tears they pay,
<A NAME="837"></A><BR>'Till tears, and kisses wear his name away.
<A NAME="838"></A><BR><BR>But Cynthia now had all her fury spent,
<A NAME="839"></A><BR>Not with less ruin than a race content:
<A NAME="840"></A><BR>Excepting Gorge, perish'd all the seed,
<A NAME="841"></A><BR>And her whom Heav'n for Hercules decreed.
<A NAME="842"></A><BR>Satiate at last, no longer she pursu'd
<A NAME="843"></A><BR>The weeping sisters; but With Wings endu'd,
<A NAME="844"></A><BR>And horny beaks, and sent to flit in air;
<A NAME="845"></A><BR>Who yearly round the tomb in feather'd flocks repair.
<A NAME="846"></A><BR><BR><B>The Transformation of the Naiads</B>
<A NAME="847"></A><BR><BR>Theseus mean-while acquitting well his share
<A NAME="848"></A><BR>In the bold chace confed'rate like a war,
<A NAME="849"></A><BR>To Athens' lofty tow'rs his march ordain'd,
<A NAME="850"></A><BR>By Pallas lov'd, and where Erectheus reign'd.
<A NAME="851"></A><BR>But Achelous stop'd him on the way,
<A NAME="852"></A><BR>By rains a deluge, and constrain'd his stay.
<A NAME="853"></A><BR><BR>O fam'd for glorious deeds, and great by blood,
<A NAME="854"></A><BR>Rest here, says he, nor trust the rapid flood;
<A NAME="855"></A><BR>It solid oaks has from its margin tore,
<A NAME="856"></A><BR>And rocky fragments down its current bore,
<A NAME="857"></A><BR>The murmur hoarse, and terrible the roar.
<A NAME="858"></A><BR>Oft have I seen herds with their shelt'ring fold
<A NAME="859"></A><BR>Forc'd from the banks, and in the torrent roul'd;
<A NAME="860"></A><BR>Nor strength the bulky steer from ruin freed,
<A NAME="861"></A><BR>Nor matchless swiftness sav'd the racing steed.
<A NAME="862"></A><BR>In cataracts when the dissolving snow
<A NAME="863"></A><BR>Falls from the hills, and floods the plains below;
<A NAME="864"></A><BR>Toss'd by the eddies with a giddy round,
<A NAME="865"></A><BR>Strong youths are in the sucking whirlpools drown'd.
<A NAME="866"></A><BR>'Tis best with me in safety to abide,
<A NAME="867"></A><BR>'Till usual bounds restrain the ebbing tide,
<A NAME="868"></A><BR>And the low waters in their channel glide.
<A NAME="869"></A><BR><BR>Theseus perswaded, in compliance bow'd:
<A NAME="870"></A><BR>So kind an offer, and advice so good,
<A NAME="871"></A><BR>O Achelous, cannot be refus'd;
<A NAME="872"></A><BR>I'll use them both, said he; and both he us'd.
<A NAME="873"></A><BR><BR>The grot he enter'd, pumice built the hall,
<A NAME="874"></A><BR>And tophi made the rustick of the wall;
<A NAME="875"></A><BR>The floor, soft moss, an humid carpet spread,
<A NAME="876"></A><BR>And various shells the chequer'd roof inlaid.
<A NAME="877"></A><BR>'Twas now the hour when the declining sun
<A NAME="878"></A><BR>Two thirds had of his daily journey run;
<A NAME="879"></A><BR>At the spread table Theseus took his place,
<A NAME="880"></A><BR>Next his companions in the daring chace;
<A NAME="881"></A><BR>Perithous here, there elder Lelex lay,
<A NAME="882"></A><BR>His locks betraying age with sprinkled grey.
<A NAME="883"></A><BR>Acharnia's river-God dispos'd the rest,
<A NAME="884"></A><BR>Grac'd with the equal honour of the feast,
<A NAME="885"></A><BR>Elate with joy, and proud of such a guest.
<A NAME="886"></A><BR>The nymphs were waiters, and with naked feet
<A NAME="887"></A><BR>In order serv'd the courses of the meat.
<A NAME="888"></A><BR>The banquet done, delicious wine they brought,
<A NAME="889"></A><BR>Of one transparent gem the cup was wrought.
<A NAME="890"></A><BR><BR>Then the great heroe of this gallant train,
<A NAME="891"></A><BR>Surveying far the prospect of the main:
<A NAME="892"></A><BR>What is that land, says he, the waves embrace?
<A NAME="893"></A><BR>(And with his finger pointed at the place);
<A NAME="894"></A><BR>Is it one parted isle which stands alone?
<A NAME="895"></A><BR>How nam'd? and yet methinks it seems not one.
<A NAME="896"></A><BR>To whom the watry God made this reply;
<A NAME="897"></A><BR>'Tis not one isle, but five; distinct they lye;
<A NAME="898"></A><BR>'Tis distance which deceives the cheated eye.
<A NAME="899"></A><BR>But that Diana's act may seem less strange,
<A NAME="900"></A><BR>These once proud Naiads were, before their change.
<A NAME="901"></A><BR>'Twas on a day more solemn than the rest,
<A NAME="902"></A><BR>Ten bullocks slain, a sacrificial feast:
<A NAME="903"></A><BR>The rural Gods of all the region near
<A NAME="904"></A><BR>They bid to dance, and taste the hallow'd cheer.
<A NAME="905"></A><BR>Me they forgot: affronted with the slight,
<A NAME="906"></A><BR>My rage, and stream swell'd to the greatest height;
<A NAME="907"></A><BR>And with the torrent of my flooding store,
<A NAME="908"></A><BR>Large woods from woods, and fields from fields I 
<A NAME="909"></A>tore.
<A NAME="910"></A><BR>The guilty nymphs, oh! then, remembring me,
<A NAME="911"></A><BR>I, with their country, wash'd into the sea;
<A NAME="912"></A><BR>And joining waters with the social main,
<A NAME="913"></A><BR>Rent the gross land, and split the firm champagne.
<A NAME="914"></A><BR>Since, the Echinades, remote from shore
<A NAME="915"></A><BR>Are view'd as many isles, as nymphs before.
<A NAME="916"></A><BR><BR><B>Perimele turn'd into an Island</B>
<A NAME="917"></A><BR><BR>But yonder far, lo, yonder does appear
<A NAME="918"></A><BR>An isle, a part to me for ever dear.
<A NAME="919"></A><BR>From that (it sailors Perimele name)
<A NAME="920"></A><BR>I doating, forc'd by rape a virgin's fame.
<A NAME="921"></A><BR>Hippodamas's passion grew so strong,
<A NAME="922"></A><BR>Gall'd with th' abuse, and fretted at the wrong,
<A NAME="923"></A><BR>He cast his pregnant daughter from a rock;
<A NAME="924"></A><BR>I spread my waves beneath, and broke the shock;
<A NAME="925"></A><BR>And as her swimming weight my stream convey'd,
<A NAME="926"></A><BR>I su'd for help divine, and thus I pray'd:
<A NAME="927"></A><BR>O pow'rful thou, whose trident does command
<A NAME="928"></A><BR>The realm of waters, which surround the land;
<A NAME="929"></A><BR>We sacred rivers, wheresoe'er begun,
<A NAME="930"></A><BR>End in thy lot, and to thy empire run.
<A NAME="931"></A><BR>With favour hear, and help with present aid;
<A NAME="932"></A><BR>Her whom I bear 'twas guilty I betray'd.
<A NAME="933"></A><BR>Yet if her father had been just, or mild,
<A NAME="934"></A><BR>He would have been less impious to his child;
<A NAME="935"></A><BR>In her, have pity'd force in the abuse;
<A NAME="936"></A><BR>In me, admitted love for my excuse.
<A NAME="937"></A><BR>O let relief for her hard case be found,
<A NAME="938"></A><BR>Her, whom paternal rage expell'd from ground,
<A NAME="939"></A><BR>Her, whom paternal rage relentless drown'd.
<A NAME="940"></A><BR>Grant her some place, or change her to a place,
<A NAME="941"></A><BR>Which I may ever clasp with my embrace.
<A NAME="942"></A><BR><BR>His nodding head the sea's great ruler bent,
<A NAME="943"></A><BR>And all his waters shook with his assent.
<A NAME="944"></A><BR>The nymph still swam, tho' with the fright distrest,
<A NAME="945"></A><BR>I felt her heart leap trembling in her breast;
<A NAME="946"></A><BR>But hardning soon, whilst I her pulse explore,
<A NAME="947"></A><BR>A crusting Earth cas'd her stiff body o'er;
<A NAME="948"></A><BR>And as accretions of new-cleaving soil
<A NAME="949"></A><BR>Inlarg'd the mass, the nymph became an isle.
<A NAME="950"></A><BR><BR><B>The Story of Baucis and Philemon</B>
<A NAME="951"></A><BR><BR>Thus Achelous ends: his audience hear
<A NAME="952"></A><BR>With admiration, and admiring, fear
<A NAME="953"></A><BR>The Pow'rs of Heav'n; except Ixion's Son,
<A NAME="954"></A><BR>Who laugh'd at all the Gods, believ'd in none:
<A NAME="955"></A><BR>He shook his impious head, and thus replies.
<A NAME="956"></A><BR>These legends are no more than pious lies:
<A NAME="957"></A><BR>You attribute too much to heav'nly sway,
<A NAME="958"></A><BR>To think they give us forms, and take away.
<A NAME="959"></A><BR><BR>The rest of better minds, their sense declar'd
<A NAME="960"></A><BR>Against this doctrine, and with horror heard.
<A NAME="961"></A><BR>Then Lelex rose, an old experienc'd man,
<A NAME="962"></A><BR>And thus with sober gravity began;
<A NAME="963"></A><BR>Heav'n's pow'r is infinite: Earth, Air, and Sea,
<A NAME="964"></A><BR>The manufacture mass, the making Pow'r obey:
<A NAME="965"></A><BR>By proof to clear your doubt; in Phrygian ground
<A NAME="966"></A><BR>Two neighb'ring trees, with walls encompass'd round,
<A NAME="967"></A><BR>Stand on a mod'rate rise, with wonder shown,
<A NAME="968"></A><BR>One a hard oak, a softer linden one:
<A NAME="969"></A><BR>I saw the place, and them, by Pittheus sent
<A NAME="970"></A><BR>To Phrygian realms, my grandsire's government.
<A NAME="971"></A><BR>Not far from thence is seen a lake, the haunt
<A NAME="972"></A><BR>Of coots, and of the fishing cormorant:
<A NAME="973"></A><BR>Here Jove with Hermes came; but in disguise
<A NAME="974"></A><BR>Of mortal men conceal'd their deities;
<A NAME="975"></A><BR>One laid aside his thunder, one his rod;
<A NAME="976"></A><BR>And many toilsome steps together trod:
<A NAME="977"></A><BR>For harbour at a thousand doors they knock'd,
<A NAME="978"></A><BR>Not one of all the thousand but was lock'd.
<A NAME="979"></A><BR>At last an hospitable house they found,
<A NAME="980"></A><BR>A homely shed; the roof, not far from ground,
<A NAME="981"></A><BR>Was thatch'd with reeds, and straw, together bound.
<A NAME="982"></A><BR>There Baucis and Philemon liv'd, and there
<A NAME="983"></A><BR>Had liv'd long marry'd, and a happy pair:
<A NAME="984"></A><BR>Now old in love, though little was their store,
<A NAME="985"></A><BR>Inur'd to want, their poverty they bore,
<A NAME="986"></A><BR>Nor aim'd at wealth, professing to be poor.
<A NAME="987"></A><BR>For master, or for servant here to call,
<A NAME="988"></A><BR>Was all alike, where only two were all.
<A NAME="989"></A><BR>Command was none, where equal love was paid,
<A NAME="990"></A><BR>Or rather both commanded, both obey'd.
<A NAME="991"></A><BR><BR>From lofty roofs the Gods repuls'd before,
<A NAME="992"></A><BR>Now stooping, enter'd through the little door:
<A NAME="993"></A><BR>The man (their hearty welcome first express'd)
<A NAME="994"></A><BR>A common settle drew for either guest,
<A NAME="995"></A><BR>Inviting each his weary limbs to rest.
<A NAME="996"></A><BR>But ere they sate, officious Baucis lays
<A NAME="997"></A><BR>Two cushions stuff'd with straw, the seat to raise;
<A NAME="998"></A><BR>Coarse, but the best she had; then rakes the load
<A NAME="999"></A><BR>Of ashes from the hearth, and spreads abroad
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR>The living coals; and, lest they should expire,
<A NAME="1001"></A><BR>With leaves, and bark she feeds her infant fire:
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR>It smoaks; and then with trembling breath she blows,
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR>'Till in a chearful blaze the flames arose.
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR>With brush-wood, and with chips she strengthens 
<A NAME="1005"></A>these,
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR>And adds at last the boughs of rotten trees.
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR>The fire thus form'd, she sets the kettle on
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR>(Like burnish'd gold the little seether shone),
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR>Next took the coleworts which her husband got
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR>From his own ground (a small well-water'd spot);
<A NAME="1011"></A><BR>She stripp'd the stalks of all their leaves; the 
<A NAME="1012"></A>best
<A NAME="1013"></A><BR>She cull'd, and them with handy care she drest.
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR>High o'er the hearth a chine of bacon hung;
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR>Good old Philemon seiz'd it with a prong,
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR>And from the sooty rafter drew it down,
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR>Then cut a slice, but scarce enough for one;
<A NAME="1018"></A><BR>Yet a large portion of a little store,
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR>Which for their sakes alone he wish'd were more.
<A NAME="1020"></A><BR>This in the pot he plung'd without delay,
<A NAME="1021"></A><BR>To tame the flesh, and drain the salt away.
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR>The time beween, before the fire they sat,
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR>And shorten'd the delay by pleasing chat.
<A NAME="1024"></A><BR><BR>A beam there was, on which a beechen pail
<A NAME="1025"></A><BR>Hung by the handle, on a driven nail:
<A NAME="1026"></A><BR>This fill'd with water, gently warm'd, they set
<A NAME="1027"></A><BR>Before their guests; in this they bath'd their feet,
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR>And after with clean towels dry'd their sweat.
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR>This done, the host produc'd the genial bed,
<A NAME="1030"></A><BR>Sallow the feet, the borders, and the sted,
<A NAME="1031"></A><BR>Which with no costly coverlet they spread,
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR>But coarse old garments; yet such robes as these
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR>They laid alone, at feasts, on holidays.
<A NAME="1034"></A><BR>The good old housewife, tucking up her gown,
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR>The table sets; th' invited Gods lie down.
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR>The trivet-table of a foot was lame,
<A NAME="1037"></A><BR>A blot which prudent Baucis overcame,
<A NAME="1038"></A><BR>Who thrusts beneath the limping leg a sherd,
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR>So was the mended board exactly rear'd:
<A NAME="1040"></A><BR>Then rubb'd it o'er with newly gather'd mint,
<A NAME="1041"></A><BR>A wholsom herb, that breath'd a grateful scent.
<A NAME="1042"></A><BR>Pallas began the feast, where first was seen
<A NAME="1043"></A><BR>The party-colour'd olive, black, and green:
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR>Autumnal cornels next in order serv'd,
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR>In lees of wine well pickled, and preserv'd.
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR>A garden-sallad was the third supply,
<A NAME="1047"></A><BR>Of endive, radishes, and succory:
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR>Then curds, and cream, the flow'r of country fare,
<A NAME="1049"></A><BR>And new-laid eggs, which Baucis' busie care
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR>Turn'd by a gentle fire, and roasted rare.
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR>All these in earthen ware were serv'd to board;
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR>And next in place, an earthen pitcher stor'd,
<A NAME="1053"></A><BR>With liquor of the best the cottage could afford.
<A NAME="1054"></A><BR>This was the table's ornament and pride,
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR>With figures wrought: like pages at his side
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR>Stood beechen bowls; and these were shining clean,
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR>Varnish'd with wax without, and lin'd within.
<A NAME="1058"></A><BR>By this the boiling kettle had prepar'd,
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR>And to the table sent the smoaking lard;
<A NAME="1060"></A><BR>On which with eager appetite they dine,
<A NAME="1061"></A><BR>A sav'ry bit, that serv'd to relish wine:
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR>The wine itself was suiting to the rest,
<A NAME="1063"></A><BR>Still working in the must, and lately press'd.
<A NAME="1064"></A><BR>The second course succeeds like that before,
<A NAME="1065"></A><BR>Plums, apples, nuts, and of their wintry store
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR>Dry figs, and grapes, and wrinkled dates were set
<A NAME="1067"></A><BR>In canisters, t' enlarge the little treat:
<A NAME="1068"></A><BR>All these a milk-white honey-comb surround,
<A NAME="1069"></A><BR>Which in the midst the country-banquet crown'd:
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR>But the kind hosts their entertainment grace
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR>With hearty welcome, and an open face:
<A NAME="1072"></A><BR>In all they did, you might discern with ease,
<A NAME="1073"></A><BR>A willing mind, and a desire to please.
<A NAME="1074"></A><BR><BR>Mean-time the beechen bowls went round, and 
<A NAME="1075"></A>still,
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR>Though often empty'd, were observ'd to fill;
<A NAME="1077"></A><BR>Fill'd without hands, and of their own accord
<A NAME="1078"></A><BR>Ran without feet, and danc'd about the board.
<A NAME="1079"></A><BR>Devotion seiz'd the pair, to see the feast
<A NAME="1080"></A><BR>With wine, and of no common grape, increas'd;
<A NAME="1081"></A><BR>And up they held their hands, and fell to pray'r,
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR>Excusing, as they could, their country fare.
<A NAME="1083"></A><BR><BR>One goose they had ('twas all they could allow),
<A NAME="1084"></A><BR>A wakeful centry, and on duty now,
<A NAME="1085"></A><BR>Whom to the Gods for sacrifice they vow:
<A NAME="1086"></A><BR>Her with malicious zeal the couple view'd;
<A NAME="1087"></A><BR>She ran for life, and limping they pursu'd:
<A NAME="1088"></A><BR>Full well the fowl perceiv'd their bad intent,
<A NAME="1089"></A><BR>And would not make her master's compliment;
<A NAME="1090"></A><BR>But persecuted, to the Pow'rs she flies,
<A NAME="1091"></A><BR>And close between the legs of Jove she lies:
<A NAME="1092"></A><BR>He with a gracious ear the suppliant heard,
<A NAME="1093"></A><BR>And sav'd her life; then what he has declar'd,
<A NAME="1094"></A><BR>And own'd the God. The neighbourhood, said he,
<A NAME="1095"></A><BR>Shall justly perish for impiety:
<A NAME="1096"></A><BR>You stand alone exempted; but obey
<A NAME="1097"></A><BR>With speed, and follow where we lead the way:
<A NAME="1098"></A><BR>Leave these accurs'd; and to the mountain's height
<A NAME="1099"></A><BR>Ascend; nor once look backward in your flight.
<A NAME="1100"></A><BR><BR>They haste, and what their tardy feet deny'd,
<A NAME="1101"></A><BR>The trusty staff (their better leg) supply'd.
<A NAME="1102"></A><BR>An arrow's flight they wanted to the top,
<A NAME="1103"></A><BR>And there secure, but spent with travel, stop;
<A NAME="1104"></A><BR>Then turn their now no more forbidden eyes;
<A NAME="1105"></A><BR>Lost in a lake the floated level lies:
<A NAME="1106"></A><BR>A watry desart covers all the plains,
<A NAME="1107"></A><BR>Their cot alone, as in an isle, remains.
<A NAME="1108"></A><BR>Wondring, with weeping eyes, while they deplore
<A NAME="1109"></A><BR>Their neighbours' fate, and country now no more,
<A NAME="1110"></A><BR>Their little shed, scarce large enough for two,
<A NAME="1111"></A><BR>Seems, from the ground increas'd, in height and bulk to 
<A NAME="1112"></A>grow.
<A NAME="1113"></A><BR>A stately temple shoots within the skies,
<A NAME="1114"></A><BR>The crotches of their cot in columns rise:
<A NAME="1115"></A><BR>The pavement polish'd marble they behold,
<A NAME="1116"></A><BR>The gates with sculpture grac'd, the spires and tiles of 
<A NAME="1117"></A>gold.
<A NAME="1118"></A><BR><BR>Then thus the sire of Gods, with looks serene,
<A NAME="1119"></A><BR>Speak thy desire, thou only just of men;
<A NAME="1120"></A><BR>And thou, o woman, only worthy found
<A NAME="1121"></A><BR>To be with such a man in marriage bound.
<A NAME="1122"></A><BR><BR>A-while they whisper; then, to Jove address'd,
<A NAME="1123"></A><BR>Philemon thus prefers their joint request:
<A NAME="1124"></A><BR>We crave to serve before your sacred shrine,
<A NAME="1125"></A><BR>And offer at your altars rites divine:
<A NAME="1126"></A><BR>And since not any action of our life
<A NAME="1127"></A><BR>Has been polluted with domestick strife;
<A NAME="1128"></A><BR>We beg one hour of death, that neither she
<A NAME="1129"></A><BR>With widow's tears may live to bury me,
<A NAME="1130"></A><BR>Nor weeping I, with wither'd arms may bear
<A NAME="1131"></A><BR>My breathless Baucis to the sepulcher.
<A NAME="1132"></A><BR><BR>The Godheads sign their suit. They run their 
<A NAME="1133"></A>race
<A NAME="1134"></A><BR>In the same tenour all th' appointed space:
<A NAME="1135"></A><BR>Then, when their hour was come, while they relate
<A NAME="1136"></A><BR>These past adventures at the temple gate,
<A NAME="1137"></A><BR>Old Baucis is by old Philemon seen
<A NAME="1138"></A><BR>Sprouting with sudden leaves of spritely green:
<A NAME="1139"></A><BR>Old Baucis look'd where old Philemon stood,
<A NAME="1140"></A><BR>And saw his lengthen'd arms a sprouting wood:
<A NAME="1141"></A><BR>New roots their fasten'd feet begin to bind,
<A NAME="1142"></A><BR>Their bodies stiffen in a rising rind:
<A NAME="1143"></A><BR>Then, ere the bark above their shoulders grew,
<A NAME="1144"></A><BR>They give, and take at once their last adieu.
<A NAME="1145"></A><BR>At once, Farewell, o faithful spouse, they said;
<A NAME="1146"></A><BR>At once th' incroaching rinds their closing lips 
<A NAME="1147"></A>invade.
<A NAME="1148"></A><BR>Ev'n yet, an ancient Tyanaean shows
<A NAME="1149"></A><BR>A spreading oak, that near a linden grows;
<A NAME="1150"></A><BR>The neighbourhood confirm the prodigy,
<A NAME="1151"></A><BR>Grave men, not vain of tongue, or like to lie.
<A NAME="1152"></A><BR>I saw my self the garlands on their boughs,
<A NAME="1153"></A><BR>And tablets hung for gifts of granted vows;
<A NAME="1154"></A><BR>And off'ring fresher up, with pious pray'r,
<A NAME="1155"></A><BR>The good, said I, are God's peculiar care,
<A NAME="1156"></A><BR>And such as honour Heav'n, shall heav'nly honour 
<A NAME="1157"></A>share.
<A NAME="1158"></A><BR><BR><B>The Changes of Proteus</B>
<A NAME="1159"></A><BR><BR>He ceas'd in his relation to proceed,
<A NAME="1160"></A><BR>Whilst all admir'd the author, and the deed;
<A NAME="1161"></A><BR>But Theseus most, inquisitive to know
<A NAME="1162"></A><BR>From Gods what wondrous alterations grow.
<A NAME="1163"></A><BR>Whom thus the Calydonian stream address'd,
<A NAME="1164"></A><BR>Rais'd high to speak, the couch his elbow press'd.
<A NAME="1165"></A><BR>Some, when transform'd, fix in the lasting change;
<A NAME="1166"></A><BR>Some with more right, thro' various figures range.
<A NAME="1167"></A><BR>Proteus, thus large thy privilege was found,
<A NAME="1168"></A><BR>Thou inmate of the seas, which Earth surround.
<A NAME="1169"></A><BR>Sometimes a bloming youth you grac'd the shore;
<A NAME="1170"></A><BR>Oft a fierce lion, or a furious boar:
<A NAME="1171"></A><BR>With glist'ning spires now seem'd an hissing snake,
<A NAME="1172"></A><BR>The bold would tremble in his hands to take:
<A NAME="1173"></A><BR>With horns assum'd a bull; sometimes you prov'd
<A NAME="1174"></A><BR>A tree by roots, a stone by weight unmov'd:
<A NAME="1175"></A><BR>Sometimes two wav'ring contraries became,
<A NAME="1176"></A><BR>Flow'd down in water, or aspir'd in flame.
<A NAME="1177"></A><BR><BR><B>The Story of Erisichthon</B>
<A NAME="1178"></A><BR><BR>In various shapes thus to deceive the eyes,
<A NAME="1179"></A><BR>Without a settled stint of her disguise,
<A NAME="1180"></A><BR>Rash Erisichthon's daughter had the pow'r,
<A NAME="1181"></A><BR>And brought it to Autolicus in dow'r.
<A NAME="1182"></A><BR>Her atheist sire the slighted Gods defy'd,
<A NAME="1183"></A><BR>And ritual honours to their shrines deny'd.
<A NAME="1184"></A><BR>As fame reports, his hand an ax sustain'd,
<A NAME="1185"></A><BR>Which Ceres' consecrated grove prophan'd;
<A NAME="1186"></A><BR>Which durst the venerable gloom invade,
<A NAME="1187"></A><BR>And violate with light the awful shade.
<A NAME="1188"></A><BR>An ancient oak in the dark center stood,
<A NAME="1189"></A><BR>The covert's glory, and itself a wood:
<A NAME="1190"></A><BR>Garlands embrac'd its shaft, and from the boughs
<A NAME="1191"></A><BR>Hung tablets, monuments of prosp'rous vows.
<A NAME="1192"></A><BR>In the cool dusk its unpierc'd verdure spread,
<A NAME="1193"></A><BR>The Dryads oft their hallow'd dances led;
<A NAME="1194"></A><BR>And oft, when round their gaging arms they cast,
<A NAME="1195"></A><BR>Full fifteen ells it measu'rd in the waste:
<A NAME="1196"></A><BR>Its height all under standards did surpass,
<A NAME="1197"></A><BR>As they aspir'd above the humbler grass.
<A NAME="1198"></A><BR><BR>These motives, which would gentler minds restrain,
<A NAME="1199"></A><BR>Could not make Triope's bold son abstain;
<A NAME="1200"></A><BR>He sternly charg'd his slaves with strict decree,
<A NAME="1201"></A><BR>To fell with gashing steel the sacred tree.
<A NAME="1202"></A><BR>But whilst they, lingring, his commands delay'd,
<A NAME="1203"></A><BR>He snatch'd an Ax, and thus blaspheming said:
<A NAME="1204"></A><BR>Was this no oak, nor Ceres' favourite care,
<A NAME="1205"></A><BR>But Ceres' self, this arm, unaw'd, shou'd dare
<A NAME="1206"></A><BR>Its leafy honours in the dust to spread,
<A NAME="1207"></A><BR>And level with the earth its airy head.
<A NAME="1208"></A><BR>He spoke, and as he poiz'd a slanting stroak,
<A NAME="1209"></A><BR>Sighs heav'd, and tremblings shook the frighted 
<A NAME="1210"></A>oak;
<A NAME="1211"></A><BR>Its leaves look'd sickly, pale its acorns grew,
<A NAME="1212"></A><BR>And its long branches sweat a chilly dew.
<A NAME="1213"></A><BR>But when his impious hand a wound bestow'd,
<A NAME="1214"></A><BR>Blood from the mangled bark in currents flow'd.
<A NAME="1215"></A><BR>When a devoted bull of mighty size,
<A NAME="1216"></A><BR>A sinning nation's grand atonement, dies;
<A NAME="1217"></A><BR>With such a plenty from the spouting veins,
<A NAME="1218"></A><BR>A crimson stream the turfy altars stains.
<A NAME="1219"></A><BR><BR>The wonder all amaz'd; yet one more bold,
<A NAME="1220"></A><BR>The fact dissuading, strove his ax to hold.
<A NAME="1221"></A><BR>But the Thessalian, obstinately bent,
<A NAME="1222"></A><BR>Too proud to change, too harden'd to repent,
<A NAME="1223"></A><BR>On his kind monitor, his eyes, which burn'd
<A NAME="1224"></A><BR>With rage, and with his eyes his weapon turn'd;
<A NAME="1225"></A><BR>Take the reward, says he, of pious dread:
<A NAME="1226"></A><BR>Then with a blow lopp'd off his parted head.
<A NAME="1227"></A><BR>No longer check'd, the wretch his crime pursu'd,
<A NAME="1228"></A><BR>Doubled his strokes, and sacrilege renew'd;
<A NAME="1229"></A><BR>When from the groaning trunk a voice was heard,
<A NAME="1230"></A><BR>A Dryad I, by Ceres' love preferr'd,
<A NAME="1231"></A><BR>Within the circle of this clasping rind
<A NAME="1232"></A><BR>Coeval grew, and now in ruin join'd;
<A NAME="1233"></A><BR>But instant vengeance shall thy sin pursue,
<A NAME="1234"></A><BR>And death is chear'd with this prophetick view.
<A NAME="1235"></A><BR><BR>At last the oak with cords enforc'd to bow,
<A NAME="1236"></A><BR>Strain'd from the top, and sap'd with wounds below,
<A NAME="1237"></A><BR>The humbler wood, partaker of its fate,
<A NAME="1238"></A><BR>Crush'd with its fall, and shiver'd with its weight.
<A NAME="1239"></A><BR><BR>The grove destroy'd, the sister Dryads moan,
<A NAME="1240"></A><BR>Griev'd at its loss, and frighted at their own.
<A NAME="1241"></A><BR>Strait, suppliants for revenge to Ceres go,
<A NAME="1242"></A><BR>In sable weeds, expressive of their woe.
<A NAME="1243"></A><BR><BR>The beauteous Goddess with a graceful air
<A NAME="1244"></A><BR>Bow'd in consent, and nodded to their pray'r.
<A NAME="1245"></A><BR>The awful motion shook the fruitful ground,
<A NAME="1246"></A><BR>And wav'd the fields with golden harvests crown'd.
<A NAME="1247"></A><BR>Soon she contriv'd in her projecting mind
<A NAME="1248"></A><BR>A plague severe, and piteous in its kind
<A NAME="1249"></A><BR>(If plagues for crimes of such presumptuous height
<A NAME="1250"></A><BR>Could pity in the softest breast create).
<A NAME="1251"></A><BR>With pinching want, and hunger's keenest smart,
<A NAME="1252"></A><BR>To tear his vitals, and corrode his heart.
<A NAME="1253"></A><BR>But since her near approach by Fate's deny'd
<A NAME="1254"></A><BR>To famine, and broad climes their pow'rs divide,
<A NAME="1255"></A><BR>A nymph, the mountain's ranger, she address'd,
<A NAME="1256"></A><BR>And thus resolv'd, her high commands express'd.
<A NAME="1257"></A><BR><BR><B>The Description of Famine</B>
<A NAME="1258"></A><BR><BR>Where frozen Scythia's utmost bound is plac'd,
<A NAME="1259"></A><BR>A desart lies, a melancholy waste:
<A NAME="1260"></A><BR>In yellow crops there Nature never smil'd,
<A NAME="1261"></A><BR>No fruitful tree to shade the barren wild.
<A NAME="1262"></A><BR>There sluggish cold its icy station makes,
<A NAME="1263"></A><BR>There paleness, frights, and aguish trembling shakes,
<A NAME="1264"></A><BR>Of pining famine this the fated seat,
<A NAME="1265"></A><BR>To whom my orders in these words repeat:
<A NAME="1266"></A><BR>Bid her this miscreant with her sharpest pains
<A NAME="1267"></A><BR>Chastise, and sheath herself into his veins;
<A NAME="1268"></A><BR>Be unsubdu'd by plenty's baffled store,
<A NAME="1269"></A><BR>Reject my empire, and defeat my pow'r.
<A NAME="1270"></A><BR>And lest the distance, and the tedious way,
<A NAME="1271"></A><BR>Should with the toil, and long fatigue dismay,
<A NAME="1272"></A><BR>Ascend my chariot, and convey'd on high,
<A NAME="1273"></A><BR>Guide the rein'd dragons thro' the parting sky.
<A NAME="1274"></A><BR><BR>The nymph, accepting of the granted carr,
<A NAME="1275"></A><BR>Sprung to the seat, and posted thro' the air;
<A NAME="1276"></A><BR>Nor stop'd 'till she to a bleak mountain came
<A NAME="1277"></A><BR>Of wondrous height, and Caucasus its name.
<A NAME="1278"></A><BR>There in a stony field the fiend she found,
<A NAME="1279"></A><BR>Herbs gnawing, and roots scratching from the ground.
<A NAME="1280"></A><BR>Her elfelock hair in matted tresses grew,
<A NAME="1281"></A><BR>Sunk were her eyes, and pale her ghastly hue,
<A NAME="1282"></A><BR>Wan were her lips, and foul with clammy glew.
<A NAME="1283"></A><BR>Her throat was furr'd, her guts appear'd within
<A NAME="1284"></A><BR>With snaky crawlings thro' her parchment skin.
<A NAME="1285"></A><BR>Her jutting hips seem'd starting from their place,
<A NAME="1286"></A><BR>And for a belly was a belly's space,
<A NAME="1287"></A><BR>Her dugs hung dangling from her craggy spine,
<A NAME="1288"></A><BR>Loose to her breast, and fasten'd to her chine.
<A NAME="1289"></A><BR>Her joints protuberant by leanness grown,
<A NAME="1290"></A><BR>Consumption sunk the flesh, and rais'd the bone.
<A NAME="1291"></A><BR>Her knees large orbits bunch'd to monstrous size,
<A NAME="1292"></A><BR>And ancles to undue proportion rise.
<A NAME="1293"></A><BR><BR>This plague the nymph, not daring to draw near,
<A NAME="1294"></A><BR>At distance hail'd, and greeted from afar.
<A NAME="1295"></A><BR>And tho' she told her charge without delay,
<A NAME="1296"></A><BR>Tho' her arrival late, and short her stay,
<A NAME="1297"></A><BR>She felt keen famine, or she seem'd to feel,
<A NAME="1298"></A><BR>Invade her blood, and on her vitals steal.
<A NAME="1299"></A><BR>She turn'd, from the infection to remove,
<A NAME="1300"></A><BR>And back to Thessaly the serpents drove.
<A NAME="1301"></A><BR><BR>The fiend obey'd the Goddess' command
<A NAME="1302"></A><BR>(Tho' their effects in opposition stand),
<A NAME="1303"></A><BR>She cut her way, supported by the wind,
<A NAME="1304"></A><BR>And reach'd the mansion by the nymph assign'd.
<A NAME="1305"></A><BR><BR>'Twas night, when entring Erisichthon's room,
<A NAME="1306"></A><BR>Dissolv'd in sleep, and thoughtless of his doom,
<A NAME="1307"></A><BR>She clasp'd his limbs, by impious labour tir'd,
<A NAME="1308"></A><BR>With battish wings, but her whole self inspir'd;
<A NAME="1309"></A><BR>Breath'd on his throat and chest a tainting blast,
<A NAME="1310"></A><BR>And in his veins infus'd an endless fast.
<A NAME="1311"></A><BR><BR>The task dispatch'd, away the Fury flies
<A NAME="1312"></A><BR>From plenteous regions, and from rip'ning skies;
<A NAME="1313"></A><BR>To her old barren north she wings her speed,
<A NAME="1314"></A><BR>And cottages distress'd with pinching need.
<A NAME="1315"></A><BR><BR>Still slumbers Erisichthon's senses drown,
<A NAME="1316"></A><BR>And sooth his fancy with their softest down.
<A NAME="1317"></A><BR>He dreams of viands delicate to eat,
<A NAME="1318"></A><BR>And revels on imaginary meat,
<A NAME="1319"></A><BR>Chaws with his working mouth, but chaws in vain,
<A NAME="1320"></A><BR>And tires his grinding teeth with fruitless pain;
<A NAME="1321"></A><BR>Deludes his throat with visionary fare,
<A NAME="1322"></A><BR>Feasts on the wind, and banquets on the air.
<A NAME="1323"></A><BR><BR>The morning came, the night, and slumbers past,
<A NAME="1324"></A><BR>But still the furious pangs of hunger last;
<A NAME="1325"></A><BR>The cank'rous rage still gnaws with griping pains,
<A NAME="1326"></A><BR>Stings in his throat, and in his bowels reigns.
<A NAME="1327"></A><BR><BR>Strait he requires, impatient in demand,
<A NAME="1328"></A><BR>Provisions from the air, the seas, the land.
<A NAME="1329"></A><BR>But tho' the land, air, seas, provisions grant,
<A NAME="1330"></A><BR>Starves at full tables, and complains of want.
<A NAME="1331"></A><BR>What to a people might in dole be paid,
<A NAME="1332"></A><BR>Or victual cities for a long blockade,
<A NAME="1333"></A><BR>Could not one wolfish appetite asswage;
<A NAME="1334"></A><BR>For glutting nourishment increas'd its rage.
<A NAME="1335"></A><BR>As rivers pour'd from ev'ry distant shore,
<A NAME="1336"></A><BR>The sea insatiate drinks, and thirsts for more;
<A NAME="1337"></A><BR>Or as the fire, which all materials burns,
<A NAME="1338"></A><BR>And wasted forests into ashes turns,
<A NAME="1339"></A><BR>Grows more voracious, as the more it preys,
<A NAME="1340"></A><BR>Recruits dilate the flame, and spread the blaze:
<A NAME="1341"></A><BR>So impious Erisichthon's hunger raves,
<A NAME="1342"></A><BR>Receives refreshments, and refreshments craves.
<A NAME="1343"></A><BR>Food raises a desire for food, and meat
<A NAME="1344"></A><BR>Is but a new provocative to eat.
<A NAME="1345"></A><BR>He grows more empty, as the more supply'd,
<A NAME="1346"></A><BR>And endless cramming but extends the void.
<A NAME="1347"></A><BR><BR><B>The Transformations of Erisichthon's Daughter</B>
<A NAME="1348"></A><BR><BR>Now riches hoarded by paternal care
<A NAME="1349"></A><BR>Were sunk, the glutton swallowing up the heir.
<A NAME="1350"></A><BR>Yet the devouring flame no stores abate,
<A NAME="1351"></A><BR>Nor less his hunger grew with his estate.
<A NAME="1352"></A><BR>One daughter left, as left his keen desire,
<A NAME="1353"></A><BR>A daughter worthy of a better sire:
<A NAME="1354"></A><BR>Her too he sold, spent Nature to sustain;
<A NAME="1355"></A><BR>She scorn'd a lord with generous disdain,
<A NAME="1356"></A><BR>And flying, spread her hand upon the main.
<A NAME="1357"></A><BR>Then pray'd: Grant, thou, I bondage may escape,
<A NAME="1358"></A><BR>And with my liberty reward thy rape;
<A NAME="1359"></A><BR>Repay my virgin treasure with thy aid
<A NAME="1360"></A><BR>('Twas Neptune who deflower'd the beauteous maid).
<A NAME="1361"></A><BR><BR>The God was mov'd, at what the fair had su'd,
<A NAME="1362"></A><BR>When she so lately by her master view'd
<A NAME="1363"></A><BR>In her known figure, on a sudden took
<A NAME="1364"></A><BR>A fisher's habit, and a manly look.
<A NAME="1365"></A><BR>To whom her owner hasted to enquire;
<A NAME="1366"></A><BR>O thou, said he, whose baits hide treach'rous wire;
<A NAME="1367"></A><BR>Whose art can manage, and experienc'd skill
<A NAME="1368"></A><BR>The taper angle, and the bobbing quill,
<A NAME="1369"></A><BR>So may the sea be ruffled with no storm,
<A NAME="1370"></A><BR>But smooth with calms, as you the truth inform;
<A NAME="1371"></A><BR>So your deceit may no shy fishes feel,
<A NAME="1372"></A><BR>'Till struck, and fasten'd on the bearded steel.
<A NAME="1373"></A><BR>Did not you standing view upon the strand,
<A NAME="1374"></A><BR>A wand'ring maid? I'm sure I saw her stand;
<A NAME="1375"></A><BR>Her hair disorder'd, and her homely dress
<A NAME="1376"></A><BR>Betray'd her want, and witness'd her distress.
<A NAME="1377"></A><BR><BR>Me heedless, she reply'd, whoe'er you are,
<A NAME="1378"></A><BR>Excuse, attentive to another care.
<A NAME="1379"></A><BR>I settled on the deep my steady eye;
<A NAME="1380"></A><BR>Fix'd on my float, and bent on my employ.
<A NAME="1381"></A><BR>And that you may not doubt what I impart,
<A NAME="1382"></A><BR>So may the ocean's God assist my art,
<A NAME="1383"></A><BR>If on the beach since I my sport pursu'd,
<A NAME="1384"></A><BR>Or man, or woman but my self I view'd.
<A NAME="1385"></A><BR>Back o'er the sands, deluded, he withdrew,
<A NAME="1386"></A><BR>Whilst she for her old form put off her new.
<A NAME="1387"></A><BR><BR>Her sire her shifting pow'r to change perceiv'd;
<A NAME="1388"></A><BR>And various chapmen by her sale deceiv'd.
<A NAME="1389"></A><BR>A fowl with spangled plumes, a brinded steer,
<A NAME="1390"></A><BR>Sometimes a crested mare, or antler'd deer:
<A NAME="1391"></A><BR>Sold for a price, she parted, to maintain
<A NAME="1392"></A><BR>Her starving parent with dishonest gain.
<A NAME="1393"></A><BR><BR>At last all means, as all provisions, fail'd;
<A NAME="1394"></A><BR>For the disease by remedies prevail'd;
<A NAME="1395"></A><BR>His muscles with a furious bite he tore,
<A NAME="1396"></A><BR>Gorg'd his own tatter'd flesh, and gulph'd his gore.
<A NAME="1397"></A><BR>Wounds were his feast, his life to life a prey,
<A NAME="1398"></A><BR>Supporting Nature by its own decay.
<A NAME="1399"></A><BR><BR>But foreign stories why shou'd I relate?
<A NAME="1400"></A><BR>I too my self can to new forms translate,
<A NAME="1401"></A><BR>Tho' the variety's not unconfin'd,
<A NAME="1402"></A><BR>But fix'd, in number, and restrain'd in kind:
<A NAME="1403"></A><BR>For often I this present shape retain,
<A NAME="1404"></A><BR>Oft curl a snake the volumes of my train.
<A NAME="1405"></A><BR>Sometimes my strength into my horns transfer'd,
<A NAME="1406"></A><BR>A bull I march, the captain of the herd.
<A NAME="1407"></A><BR>But whilst I once those goring weapons wore,
<A NAME="1408"></A><BR>Vast wresting force one from my forehead tore.
<A NAME="1409"></A><BR>Lo, my maim'd brows the injury still own;
<A NAME="1410"></A><BR>He ceas'd; his words concluding with a groan.
