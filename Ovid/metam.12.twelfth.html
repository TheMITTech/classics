<A NAME="10"></A><B>The Trojan War</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>Priam, to whom the story was unknown,
<A NAME="12"></A><BR>As dead, deplor'd his metamorphos'd son:
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>A cenotaph his name, and title kept,
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>And Hector round the tomb, with all his brothers, 
<A NAME="15"></A>wept.
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>This pious office Paris did not share;
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>Absent alone; and author of the war,
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>Which, for the Spartan queen, the Grecians drew
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>T' avenge the rape; and Asia to subdue.
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>A thousand ships were mann'd, to sail the sea:
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>Nor had their just resentments found delay,
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>Had not the winds, and waves oppos'd their way.
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>At Aulis, with united pow'rs they meet,
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>But there, cross-winds or calms detain'd the fleet.
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>Now, while they raise an altar on the shore,
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>And Jove with solemn sacrifice adore;
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>A boding sign the priests and people see:
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>A snake of size immense ascends a tree,
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>And, in the leafie summit, spy'd a nest,
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>Which o'er her callow young, a sparrow press'd.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>Eight were the birds unfledg'd; their mother flew,
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>And hover'd round her care; but still in view:
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>'Till the fierce reptile first devour'd the brood,
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>Then seiz'd the flutt'ring dam, and drunk her blood.
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>This dire ostent, the fearful people view;
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>Calchas alone, by Phoebus taught, foreknew
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>What Heav'n decreed; and with a smiling glance,
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>Thus gratulates to Greece her happy chance:
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>O Argives, we shall conquer: Troy is ours,
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>But long delays shall first afflict our pow'rs:
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>Nine years of labour, the nine birds portend;
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>The tenth shall in the town's destruction end.
<A NAME="43"></A><BR><BR>The serpent, who his maw obscene had fill'd,
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>The branches in his curl'd embraces held:
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>But, as in spires he stood, he turn'd to stone:
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>The stony snake retain'd the figure still his own.
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR>Yet, not for this, the wind-bound navy weigh'd;
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>Slack were their sails; and Neptune disobey'd.
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>Some thought him loth the town should be destroy'd,
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>Whose building had his hands divine employ'd:
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>Not so the seer; who knew, and known foreshow'd,
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>The virgin Phoebe, with a virgin's blood
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>Must first be reconcil'd: the common cause
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>Prevail'd; and pity yielding to the laws,
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>Fair Iphigenia the devoted maid
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>Was, by the weeping priests, in linnen-robes array'd;
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>All mourn her fate; but no relief appear'd;
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>The royal victim bound, the knife already rear'd:
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>When that offended Pow'r, who caus'd their woe,
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>Relenting ceas'd her wrath; and stop'd the coming 
<A NAME="61"></A>blow.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>A mist before the ministers she cast,
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>And, in the virgin's room, a hind she plac'd.
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>Th' oblation slain, and Phoebe, reconcil'd,
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>The storm was hush'd, and dimpled ocean smil'd:
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>A favourable gale arose from shore,
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>Which to the port desir'd, the Graecian gallies 
<A NAME="68"></A>bore.
<A NAME="69"></A><BR><BR><B>The House of Fame</B>
<A NAME="70"></A><BR><BR>Full in the midst of this created space,
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>Betwixt Heav'n, Earth, and skies, there stands a 
<A NAME="72"></A>place,
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>Confining on all three, with triple bound;
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>Whence all things, tho' remote, are view'd around;
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>And thither bring their undulating sound.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>The palace of loud Fame, her seat of pow'r,
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>Plac'd on the summet of a lofty tow'r;
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>A thousand winding entries long and wide,
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>Receive of fresh reports a flowing tide.
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>A thousand crannies in the walls are made;
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>Nor gate, nor bars exclude the busie trade.
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>'Tis built of brass, the better to diffuse
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>The spreading sounds, and multiply the news:
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>Where eccho's in repeated eccho's play:
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>A mart for ever full, and open night and day.
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>Nor silence is within, nor voice express,
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>But a deaf noise of sounds, that never cease.
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>Confus'd and chiding, like the hollow roar
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>Of tides, receding from th' insulted shore,
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>Or like the broken thunder heard from far,
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>When Jove at distance drives the rouling war.
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>The courts are fill'd with a tumultuous din
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>Of crouds, or issuing forth, or entring in:
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>A thorough-fare of news: where some devise
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>Things never heard, some mingle truth with lies;
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>The troubled air with empty sounds they beat,
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>Intent to hear, and eager to repeat.
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>Error sits brooding there, with added train
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>Of vain credulity, and joys as vain:
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>Suspicion, with sedition join'd, are near,
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>And rumours rais'd, and murmurs mix'd, and panique 
<A NAME="102"></A>fear.
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>Fame sits aloft, and sees the subject ground,
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>And seas about, and skies above; enquiring all around.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR>The Goddess gives th' alarm; and soon is known
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>The Grecian fleet descending on the town.
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>Fix'd on defence, the Trojans are not slow
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>To guard their shore, from an expected foe.
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>They meet in fight: by Hector's fatal hand
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>Protesilaus falls, and bites the strand:
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>Which with expence of blood the Grecians won;
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>And prov'd the strength unknown of Priam's son.
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>And to their cost the Trojan leaders felt
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>The Grecian heroes; and what deaths they dealt.
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR><B>The Story of Cygnus</B>
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR>From these first onsets, the Sigaean shore
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>Was strew'd with carcasses, and stain'd with gore:
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>Neptunian Cygnus troops of Greeks had slain;
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>Achilles in his carr had scour'd the plain,
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>And clear'd the Trojan ranks: where-e'er he fought,
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>Cygnus, or Hector, through the fields he sought:
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>Cygnus he found; on him his force essay'd:
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>For Hector was to the tenth year delay'd.
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>His white-main'd steeds, that bow'd beneath the 
<A NAME="125"></A>yoke,
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>He chear'd to courage, with a gentle stroke;
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>Then urg'd his fiery chariot on the foe;
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>And rising shook his lance; in act to throw.
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>But first he cry'd, O youth, be proud to bear
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>Thy death, ennobled by Pelides' spear.
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>The lance pursu'd the voice without delay,
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>Nor did the whizzing weapon miss the way;
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>But pierc'd his cuirass, with such fury sent,
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>And sign'd his bosom with a purple dint.
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>At this the seed of Neptune: Goddess-born,
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>For ornament, not use, these arms are worn;
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>This helm, and heavy buckler, I can spare;
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>As only decorations of the war:
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>So Mars is arm'd for glory, not for need.
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>'Tis somewhat more from Neptune to proceed,
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>Than from a daughter of the sea to spring:
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>Thy sire is mortal; mine is ocean's king.
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>Secure of death, I shou'd contemn thy dart,
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>Tho' naked; and impassible depart:
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>He said, and threw: the trembling weapon pass'd
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>Through nine bull-hides, each under other plac'd,
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>On his broad shield; and stuck within the last.
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>Achilles wrench'd it out; and sent again
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>The hostile gift: the hostile gift was vain.
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>He try'd a third, a tough well-chosen spear;
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>Th' inviolable body stood sincere,
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>Though Cygnus then did no defence provide,
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>But scornful offer'd his unshielded side.
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR>Not otherwise th' impatient hero far'd,
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>Than as a bull incompass'd with a guard,
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>Amid the Circus roars, provok'd from far
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>By sight of scarlet, and a sanguine war:
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>They quit their ground, his bended horns elude;
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>In vain pursuing, and in vain pursu'd:
<A NAME="160"></A><BR><BR>Before to farther fight he wou'd advance,
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>He stood considering, and survey'd his lance.
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>Doubts if he wielded not a wooden spear
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>Without a point: he look'd, the point was there.
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>This is my hand, and this my lance, he said;
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>By which so many thousand foes are dead,
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>O whither is their usual virtue fled!
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>I had it once; and the Lyrnessian wall,
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>And Tenedos, confess'd it in their fall.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>Thy streams, Caicus, rowl'd a crimson-flood;
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>And Thebes ran red with her own natives' blood.
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>Twice Telephus employ'd their piercing steel,
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>To wound him first, and afterward to heal.
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>The vigour of this arm was never vain:
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>And that my wonted prowess I retain,
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>Witness these heaps of slaughter on the plain.
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>He said; and, doubtful of his former deeds,
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>To some new tryal of his force proceeds.
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>He chose Menoetes from among the rest;
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>At him he launch'd his spear, and pierc'd his breast:
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>On the hard earth the Lycian knock'd his head,
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>And lay supine; and forth the spirit fled.
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>Then thus the hero: Neither can I blame
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>The hand, or jav'lin; both are still the same.
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>The same I will employ against this foe,
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>And wish but with the same success to throw.
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>So spoke the chief; and while he spoke he threw;
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>The weapon with unerring fury flew,
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>At his left shoulder aim'd: nor entrance found;
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>But back, as from a rock, with swift rebound
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>Harmless return'd: a bloody mark appear'd,
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>Which with false joy the flatter'd hero chear'd.
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>Wound there was none; the blood that was in view,
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>The lance before from slain Menoetes drew.
<A NAME="194"></A><BR><BR>Headlong he leaps from off his lofty car,
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>And in close fight on foot renews the war.
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>Raging with high disdain, repeats his blows;
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>Nor shield, nor armour can their force oppose;
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>Huge cantlets of his buckler strew the ground,
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>And no defence in his bor'd arms is found,
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>But on his flesh, no wound or blood is seen;
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>The sword it self is blunted on the skin.
<A NAME="202"></A><BR><BR>This vain attempt the chief no longer bears;
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>But round his hollow temples and his ears
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>His buckler beats: the son of Neptune, stunn'd
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>With these repeated buffets, quits his ground;
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>A sickly sweat succeeds, and shades of night;
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>Inverted Nature swims before his sight:
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>Th' insulting victor presses on the more,
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>And treads the steps the vanquish'd trod before,
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>Nor rest, nor respite gives. A stone there lay
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>Behind his trembling foe, and stopp'd his way:
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>Achilles took th' advantage which he found,
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>O'er-turn'd, and push'd him backward on the ground,
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>His buckler held him under, while he press'd,
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>With both his knees, above his panting breast.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>Unlac'd his helm: about his chin the twist
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>He ty'd; and soon the strangled soul dismiss'd.
<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR>With eager haste he went to strip the dead:
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>The vanish'd body from his arms was fled.
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>His sea-God sire, t' immortalize his frame,
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>Had turn'd it to a bird that bears his name.
<A NAME="222"></A><BR><BR>A truce succeeds the labours of this day,
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>And arms suspended with a long delay.
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>While Trojan walls are kept with watch and ward;
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>The Greeks before their trenches mount the guard;
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>The feast approach'd; when to the blue-ey'd maid
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>His vows for Cygnus slain the victor paid,
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>And a white heyfer on her altar laid.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>The reeking entrails on the fire they threw,
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>And to the Gods the grateful odour flew.
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>Heav'n had its part in sacrifice: the rest
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>Was broil'd, and roasted for the future feast.
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>The chief-invited guests were set around!
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>And hunger first asswag'd, the bowls were crown'd,
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>Which in deep draughts their cares, and labours 
<A NAME="236"></A>drown'd.
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>The mellow harp did not their ears employ:
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>And mute was all the warlike symphony:
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>Discourse, the food of souls, was their delight,
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>And pleasing chat prolong'd the summer's night.
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>The subject, deeds of arms; and valour shown,
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>Or on the Trojan side, or on their own.
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>Of dangers undertaken, fame atchiev'd,
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>They talk'd by turns; the talk by turns reliev'd.
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>What things but these could fierce Achilles tell,
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>Or what cou'd fierce Achilles hear so well?
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>The last great act perform'd, of Cygnus slain,
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>Did most the martial audience entertain:
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>Wondring to find a body free by Fate
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>From steel; and which cou'd ev'n that steel rebate:
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>Amaz'd, their admiration they renew;
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>And scarce Pelides cou'd believe it true.
<A NAME="253"></A><BR><BR><B>The Story of Caeneus</B>
<A NAME="254"></A><BR><BR>Then Nestor thus: what once this age has known,
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>In fated Cygnus, and in him alone,
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>These eyes have seen in Caeneus long before;
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>Whose body not a thousand swords cou'd bore.
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>Caeneus, in courage, and in strength, excell'd;
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>And still his Othrys with his fame is fill'd:
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>But what did most his martial deeds adorn
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>(Though since he chang'd his sex) a woman born.
<A NAME="262"></A><BR><BR>A novelty so strange, and full of Fate,
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>His list'ning audience ask'd him to relate.
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>Achilles thus commends their common sute:
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>O father, first for prudence in repute,
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>Tell, with that eloquence, so much thy own,
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>What thou hast heard, or what of Caeneus known:
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>What was he, whence his change of sex begun,
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>What trophies, join'd in wars with thee, he won?
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>Who conquer'd him, and in what fatal strife
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>The youth, without a wound, cou'd lose his life?
<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR>Neleides then: Though tardy age, and time,
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>Have shrunk my sinews, and decay'd my prime;
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>Though much I have forgotten of my store,
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>Yet not exhausted, I remember more.
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>Of all that arms atchiev'd, or peace design'd,
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>That action still is fresher in my mind,
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>Than ought beside. If reverend age can give
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>To faith a sanction, in my third I live.
<A NAME="280"></A><BR><BR>'Twas in my second cent'ry, I survey'd
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>Young Caenis, then a fair Thessalian maid:
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>Caenis the bright, was born to high command;
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>A princess, and a native of thy land,
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>Divine Achilles; every tongue proclaim'd
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>Her beauty, and her eyes all hearts inflam'd.
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>Peleus, thy sire, perhaps had sought her bed,
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>Among the rest; but he had either led
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>Thy mother then; or was by promise ty'd;
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>But she to him, and all, alike her love deny'd.
<A NAME="290"></A><BR><BR>It was her fortune once to take her way
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>Along the sandy margin of the sea:
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>The Pow'r of ocean view'd her as she pass'd,
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>And, lov'd as soon as seen, by force embrac'd.
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>So Fame reports. Her virgin-treasure seiz'd,
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>And his new joys, the ravisher so pleas'd,
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>That thus, transported, to the nymph he cry'd;
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>Ask what thou wilt, no pray'r shall be deny'd.
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>This also Fame relates: the haughty fair,
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>Who not the rape ev'n of a God cou'd bear,
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>This answer, proud, return'd: To mighty wrongs
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>A mighty recompence, of right, belongs.
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>Give me no more to suffer such a shame;
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>But change the woman, for a better name;
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>One gift for all: she said; and while she spoke,
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>A stern, majestick, manly tone she took.
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>A man she was: and as the Godhead swore,
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>To Caeneus turn'd, who Caenis was before.
<A NAME="308"></A><BR><BR>To this the lover adds, without request,
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>No force of steel shou'd violate his breast.
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>Glad of the gift, the new-made warrior goes;
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>And arms among the Greeks, and longs for equal foes.
<A NAME="312"></A><BR><BR><B>The Skirmish between the Centaurs and Lapithites</B>
<A NAME="313"></A><BR><BR>Now brave Perithous, bold Ixion's son,
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>The love of fair Hippodame had won.
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>The cloud-begotten race, half men, half beast,
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>Invited, came to grace the nuptial feast:
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>In a cool cave's recess the treat was made,
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>Whose entrance, trees with spreading boughs o'er-shade
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>They sate: and summon'd by the bridegroom, came,
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>To mix with those, the Lapythaean name:
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>Nor wanted I: the roofs with joy resound:
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>And Hymen, Io Hymen, rung around.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>Rais'd altars shone with holy fires; the bride,
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>Lovely her self (and lovely by her side
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>A bevy of bright nymphs, with sober grace),
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>Came glitt'ring like a star, and took her place.
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>Her heav'nly form beheld, all wish'd her joy;
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>And little wanted; but in vain, their wishes all 
<A NAME="329"></A>employ.
<A NAME="330"></A><BR><BR>For one, most brutal, of the brutal brood,
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>Or whether wine, or beauty fir'd his blood,
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>Or both at once, beheld with lustful eyes
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>The bride; at once resolv'd to make his prize.
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>Down went the board; and fastning on her hair,
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>He seiz'd with sudden force the frighted fair.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>'Twas Eurytus began: his bestial kind
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>His crime pursu'd; and each as pleas'd his mind,
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>Or her, whom chance presented, took: the feast
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>An image of a taken town express'd.
<A NAME="340"></A><BR><BR>The cave resounds with female shrieks; we rise,
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>Mad with revenge to make a swift reprise:
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>And Theseus first, What phrenzy has possess'd,
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>O Eurytus, he cry'd, thy brutal breast,
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>To wrong Perithous, and not him alone,
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>But while I live, two friends conjoyn'd in one?
<A NAME="346"></A><BR><BR>To justifie his threat, he thrusts aside
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>The crowd of centaurs; and redeems the bride:
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>The monster nought reply'd: for words were vain,
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>And deeds cou'd only deeds unjust maintain;
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>But answers with his hand, and forward press'd,
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>With blows redoubled, on his face, and breast.
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>An ample goblet stood, of antick mold,
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>And rough with figures of the rising gold;
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>The hero snatch'd it up, and toss'd in air
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>Full at the front of the foul ravisher.
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>He falls; and falling vomits forth a flood
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>Of wine, and foam, and brains, and mingled blood.
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>Half roaring, and half neighing through the hall,
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>Arms, arms, the double-form'd with fury call;
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>To wreak their brother's death: a medley-flight
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>Of bowls, and jars, at first supply the fight,
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>Once instruments of feasts; but now of Fate;
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>Wine animates their rage, and arms their hate.
<A NAME="364"></A><BR><BR>Bold Amycus, from the robb'd vestry brings
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>The chalices of Heav'n; and holy things
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>Of precious weight: a sconce that hung on high,
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>With tapers fill'd, to light the sacristy,
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>Torn from the cord, with his unhallow'd hand
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>He threw amid the Lapythaean band.
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>On Celadon the ruin fell; and left
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>His face of feature, and of form bereft:
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>So, when some brawny sacrificer knocks,
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>Before an altar led, an offer'd ox,
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>His eyes-balls rooted out, are thrown to ground;
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>His nose, dismantled, in his mouth is found;
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>His jaws, cheeks, front, one undistinguish'd wound.
<A NAME="377"></A><BR><BR>This, Belates, th' avenger, cou'd not brook;
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>But, by the foot, a maple board he took;
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>And hurl'd at Amycus; his chin it bent
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>Against his chest, and down the centaur sent:
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>Whom sputtring bloody teeth, the second blow
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>Of his drawn sword, dispatch'd to shades below.
<A NAME="383"></A><BR><BR>Grineus was near; and cast a furious look
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>On the side-altar, cens'd with sacred smoke,
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>And bright with flaming fires; The Gods, he cry'd,
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>Have with their holy trade our hands supply'd:
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>Why use we not their gifts? Then from the floor
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>An altar stone he heav'd, with all the load it bore:
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>Altar, and altar's freight together slew,
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>Where thickest throng'd the Lapythaean crew:
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>And, at once, Broteas and Oryus flew.
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>Oryus' mother, Mycale, was known
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>Down from her sphere to draw the lab'ring moon.
<A NAME="394"></A><BR><BR>Exadius cry'd, Unpunish'd shall not go
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>This fact, if arms are found against the foe.
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>He look'd about, where on a pine were spread
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>The votive horns of a stag's branching head:
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>At Grineus these he throws; so just they fly,
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>That the sharp antlers stuck in either eye:
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>Breathless, and blind he fell; with blood besmear'd;
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>His eye-balls beaten out, hung dangling on his beard.
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>Fierce Rhoetus, from the hearth a burning brand
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>Selects, and whirling waves; 'till, from his hand
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>The fire took flame; then dash'd it from the right,
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>On fair Charaxus' temples, near the sight:
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>The whistling pest came on, and pierc'd the bone,
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>And caught the yellow hair, that shrivel'd while it 
<A NAME="408"></A>shone.
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>Caught, like dry stubble fir'd; or like seerwood;
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>Yet from the wound ensu'd no purple flood;
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>But look'd a bubbling mass of frying blood.
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>His blazing locks sent forth a crackling sound;
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>And hiss'd, like red hot ir'n within the smithy 
<A NAME="414"></A>drown'd.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>The wounded warrior shook his flaming hair,
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>Then (what a team of horse could hardly rear)
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>He heaves the threshold stone, but could not throw;
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>The weight itself forbad the threaten'd blow;
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>Which dropping from his lifted arms, came down
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>Full on Cometes' head; and crush'd his crown.
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>Nor Rhoetus then retain'd his joy; but said,
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>So by their fellows may our foes be sped;
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>Then, with redoubled strokes he plies his head:
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>The burning lever not deludes his pains:
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>But drives the batter'd skull within the brains.
<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR>Thus flush'd, the conqueror, with force renew'd,
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>Evagrus, Dryas, Corythus, pursu'd:
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>First, Corythus, with downy cheeks, he slew;
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>Whose fall, when fierce Evagrus had in view,
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>He cry'd, What palm is from a beardless prey?
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>Rhoetus prevents what more he had to say;
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>And drove within his mouth the fi'ry death,
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>Which enter'd hissing in, and choak'd his breath.
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>At Dryas next he flew: but weary chance,
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>No longer wou'd the same success advance.
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>For while he whirl'd in fiery circles round
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>The brand, a sharpen'd stake strong Dryas found;
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>And in the shoulder's joint inflicts the wound.
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>The weapon stuck; which, roaring out with pain,
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>He drew; nor longer durst the fight maintain,
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>But turn'd his back, for fear; and fled amain.
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>With him fled Orneus, with like dread possess'd,
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>Thaumas, and Medon wounded in the breast;
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>And Mermeros, in the late race renown'd,
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>Now limping ran, and tardy with his wound.
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>Pholus, and Melaneus from fight withdrew,
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>And Abas maim'd, who boars encountring slew:
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>And Augur Asbolos, whose art in vain,
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>From fight dissuaded the four-footed train,
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>Now beat the hoof with Nessus on the plain;
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>But to his fellow cry'd, Be safely slow,
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>Thy death deferr'd is due to great Alcides' bow.
<A NAME="453"></A><BR><BR>Mean-time strong Dryas urg'd his chance so well,
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>That Lycidas, Areos, Imbreus fell;
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>All, one by one, and fighting face to face:
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>Crenaeus fled, to fall with more disgrace:
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>For, fearful, while he look'd behind, he bore,
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>Betwixt his nose, and front, the blow before.
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>Amid the noise, and tumult of the fray,
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>Snoring, and drunk with wine, Aphidas lay.
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>Ev'n then the bowl within his hand he kept,
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>And on a bear's rough hide securely slept.
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>Him Phorbas with his flying dart transfix'd;
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>Take thy next draught, with Stygian waters mix'd,
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>And sleep thy fill, th' insulting victor cry'd;
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>Surpriz'd with death unfelt, the centaur dy'd;
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>The ruddy vomit, as he breath'd his soul
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>Repass'd his throat, and fill'd his empty bowl.
<A NAME="469"></A><BR><BR>I saw Petraeus' arms employ'd around
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>A well-grown oak, to root it from the ground.
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>This way, and that, he wrench'd the fibrous bands;
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>The trunk was like a sappling, in his hands,
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>And still obey'd the bent: while thus he stood,
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>Perithous' dart drove on; and nail'd him to the 
<A NAME="475"></A>wood;
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>Lycus, and Chromis fell, by him oppress'd:
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>Helops, and Dictis added to the rest
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>A nobler palm: Helops, through either ear
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>Transfix'd, receiv'd the penetrating spear.
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>This Dictis saw; and, seiz'd with sudden fright,
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>Leapt headlong from the hill of steepy height;
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>And crush'd an ash beneath, that cou'd not bear his 
<A NAME="483"></A>weight.
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>The shatter'd tree receives his fall; and strikes,
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>Within his full-blown paunch, the sharpen'd spikes.
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>Strong Aphareus had heav'd a mighty stone,
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>The fragment of a rock; and wou'd have thrown;
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>But Theseus, with a club of harden'd oak,
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>The cubit-bone of the bold centaur broke;
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>And left him maim'd; nor seconded the stroke.
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>Then leapt on tall Bianor's back (who bore
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>No mortal burden but his own, before);
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>Press'd with his knees his sides; the double man,
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>His speed with spurs increas'd, unwilling ran.
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>One hand the hero fastn'd on his locks;
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>His other ply'd him with repeated strokes.
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>The club rung round his ears, and batter'd brows;
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>He falls; and lashing up his heels, his rider throws.
<A NAME="499"></A><BR><BR>The same Herculean arms, Nedymnus wound;
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>And lay by him Lycotas on the ground,
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>And Hippasus, whose beard his breast invades;
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>And Ripheus, haunter of the woodland shades:
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>And Thereus, us'd with mountain-bears to strive,
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>And from their dens to draw th' indignant beasts 
<A NAME="505"></A>alive.
<A NAME="506"></A><BR><BR>Demoleon cou'd not bear this hateful sight,
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>Or the long fortune of th' Athenian knight:
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>But pull'd with all his force, to disengage
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>From Earth a pine, the product of an age:
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>The root stuck fast: the broken trunk he sent
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>At Theseus; Theseus frustrates his intent,
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>And leaps aside; by Pallas warn'd, the blow
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>To shun (for so he said; and we believ'd it so).
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>Yet not in vain th' enormous weight was cast;
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>Which Crantor's body sunder'd at the waist:
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>Thy father's 'squire, Achilles, and his care;
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>Whom conquer'd in the Polopeian war,
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>Their king, his present ruin to prevent,
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>A pledge of peace implor'd, to Peleus sent.
<A NAME="520"></A><BR><BR>Thy sire, with grieving eyes, beheld his Fate;
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>And cry'd, Not long, lov'd Crantor, shalt thou wait
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>Thy vow'd revenge. At once he said, and threw
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>His ashen-spear; which quiver'd, as it flew;
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>With all his force, and all his soul apply'd;
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>The sharp point enter'd in the centaur's side:
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>Both hands, to wrench it out, the monster join'd;
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>And wrench'd it out; but left the steel behind;
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>Stuck in his lungs it stood: inrag'd he rears
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>His hoofs, and down to ground thy father bears.
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>Thus trampled under foot, his shield defends
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>His head; his other hand the lance portends.
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>Ev'n while he lay extended on the dust,
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>He sped the centaur, with one single thrust.
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>Two more his lance before transfix'd from far;
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>And two, his sword had slain, in closer war.
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>To these was added Dorylas, who spread
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>A bull's two goring horns around his head.
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>With these he push'd; in blood already dy'd,
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>Him fearless, I approach'd; and thus defy'd:
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>Now, monster, now, by proof it shall appear,
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>Whether thy horns are sharper, or my spear.
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>At this, I threw: for want of other ward,
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>He lifted up his hand, his front to guard.
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>His hand it pass'd; and fix'd it to his brow:
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>Loud shouts of ours attend the lucky blow.
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>Him Peleus finish'd, with a second wound,
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>Which thro' the navel pierc'd: he reel'd around;
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>And dragg'd his dangling bowels on the ground.
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>Trod what he drag'd; and what he trod, he crush'd:
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>And to his mother-Earth, with empty belly, rush'd.
<A NAME="551"></A><BR><BR><B>The Story of Cyllarus and Hylonome</B>
<A NAME="552"></A><BR><BR>Nor cou'd thy form, o Cyllarus, foreflow
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>Thy Fate (if form to monsters men allow):
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>Just bloom'd thy beard: thy beard of golden hue:
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>Thy locks, in golden waves, about thy shoulders 
<A NAME="556"></A>flew.
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>Sprightly thy look: thy shapes in ev'ry part
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>So clean, as might instruct the sculptor's art;
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>As far as man extended: where began
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>The beast, the beast was equal to the man.
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>Add but a horse's head and neck; and he,
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>O Castor, was a courser worthy thee.
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>So was his back proportion'd for the seat:
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>So rose his brawny chest; so swiftly mov'd his feet.
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>Coal-black his colour, but like jett it shone;
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>His legs, and flowing tail were white alone.
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>Belov'd by many maidens of his kind;
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>But fair Hylonome possess'd his mind;
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>Hylonome, for features, and for face,
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>Excelling all the nymphs of double race:
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>Nor less her blandishments, than beauty, move;
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>At once both loving, and confessing love.
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>For him she dress'd: for him, with female care
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>She comb'd, and set in curls, her auburn hair.
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>Of roses, violets, and lillies mix'd,
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>And sprigs of flowing rosemary betwixt,
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>She form'd the chaplet, that adorn'd her front:
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>In waters of the Pegasaean fount,
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>And in the streams that from the fountain play,
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>She wash'd her face; and bath'd her twice a-day.
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>The scarf of furs, that hung below her side,
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>Was ermin, or the panther's spotted pride;
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>Spoils of no common beast: with equal flame
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>They lov'd: their silvan pleasures were the same:
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>All day they hunted: and when day expir'd,
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>Together to some shady cave retir'd:
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>Invited to the nuptials, both repair:
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>And, side by side, they both engage in war.
<A NAME="589"></A><BR><BR>Uncertain from what hand, a flying dart
<A NAME="590"></A><BR>At Cyllarus was sent; which pierc'd his heart.
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>The jav'lin drawn from out the mortal wound,
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>He faints with stagg'ring steps; and seeks the ground:
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>The fair within her arms receiv'd his fall,
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>And strove his wand'ring spirits to recall:
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>And while her hand the streaming blood oppos'd,
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>Join'd face to face, his lips with hers she clos'd.
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>Stifled with kisses, a sweet death he dies;
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>She fills the fields with undistinguish'd cries;
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>At least her words were in her clamour drown'd;
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>For my stunn'd ears receiv'd no vocal sound.
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>In madness of her grief, she seiz'd the dart
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>New-drawn, and reeking from her lover's heart;
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>To her bare bosom the sharp point apply'd;
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>And wounded fell; and falling by his side,
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>Embrac'd him in her arms; and thus embracing dy'd.
<A NAME="606"></A><BR><BR>Ev'n still methinks, I see Phaeocomes;
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>Strange was his habit, and as odd his dress.
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>Six lions' hides, with thongs together fast,
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>His upper part defended to his waist:
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>And where man ended, the continued vest,
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>Spread on his back, the houss and trappings of a 
<A NAME="612"></A>beast.
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>A stump too heavy for a team to draw
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>(It seems a fable, tho' the fact I saw);
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>He threw at Pholon; the descending blow
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>Divides the skull, and cleaves his head in two.
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>The brains, from nose, and mouth, and either ear,
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>Came issuing out, as through a colendar
<A NAME="619"></A><BR>The curdled milk; or from the press the whey,
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>Driv'n down by weight above, is drain'd away.
<A NAME="621"></A><BR><BR>But him, while stooping down to spoil the slain,
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>Pierc'd through the paunch, I tumbled on the plain.
<A NAME="623"></A><BR>Then Chthonyus, and Teleboas I slew:
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>A fork the former arm'd; a dart his fellow threw.
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>The jav'lin wounded me (behold the scar,
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>Then was my time to seek the Trojan war;
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>Then I was Hector's match in open field;
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>But he was then unborn; at least a child:
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>Now, I am nothing). I forbear to tell
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>By Periphantas how Pyretus fell;
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>The centaur by the knight: nor will I stay
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>On Amphix, or what deaths he dealt that day:
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>What honour, with a pointless lance, he won,
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>Stuck in the front of a four-footed man.
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>What fame young Macareus obtain'd in fight:
<A NAME="636"></A><BR>Or dwell on Nessus, now return'd from flight.
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>How prophet Mopsus not alone divin'd,
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>Whose valour equal'd his foreseeing mind.
<A NAME="639"></A><BR><BR><B>Caeneus transform'd to an Eagle</B>
<A NAME="640"></A><BR><BR>Already Caeneus, with his conquering hand,
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>Had slaughter'd five the boldest of their band.
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>Pyrachmus, Helymus, Antimachus,
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>Bromus the brave, and stronger Stiphelus,
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>Their names I number'd, and remember well,
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>No trace remaining, by what wounds they fell.
<A NAME="646"></A><BR><BR>Laitreus, the bulki'st of the double race,
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>Whom the spoil'd arms of slain Halesus grace,
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>In years retaining still his youthful might,
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>Though his black hairs were interspers'd with white,
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>Betwixt th' imbattled ranks began to prance,
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>Proud of his helm, and Macedonian lance;
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>And rode the ring around; that either hoast
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>Might hear him, while he made this empty boast:
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>And from a strumpet shall we suffer shame?
<A NAME="655"></A><BR>For Caenis still, not Caeneus, is thy name:
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>And still the native softness of thy kind
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>Prevails; and leaves the woman in thy mind;
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>Remember what thou wert; what price was paid
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>To change thy sex; to make thee not a maid:
<A NAME="660"></A><BR>And but a man in shew; go, card and spin;
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>And leave the business of the war to men.
<A NAME="662"></A><BR><BR>While thus the boaster exercis'd his pride,
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>The fatal spear of Caeneus reach'd his side:
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>Just in the mixture of the kinds it ran;
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>Betwixt the neather beast, and upper man:
<A NAME="666"></A><BR>The monster mad with rage, and stung with smart,
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>His lance directed at the hero's heart:
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>It struck; but bounded from his harden'd breast,
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>Like hail from tiles, which the safe house invest.
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>Nor seem'd the stroke with more effect to come,
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>Than a small pebble falling on a drum.
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>He next his fauchion try'd, in closer fight;
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>But the keen fauchion had no pow'r to bite.
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>He thrust; the blunted point return'd again:
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>Since downright blows, he cry'd, and thrusts are 
<A NAME="676"></A>vain,
<A NAME="677"></A><BR>I'll prove his side; in strong embraces held
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>He prov'd his side; his side the sword repell'd:
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>His hollow belly eccho'd to the stroke,
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>Untouch'd his body, as a solid rock;
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>Aim'd at his neck at last, the blade in shivers 
<A NAME="682"></A>broke.
<A NAME="683"></A><BR><BR>Th' impassive knight stood idle, to deride
<A NAME="684"></A><BR>His rage, and offer'd oft his naked side;
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>At length, Now monster, in thy turn, he cry'd,
<A NAME="686"></A><BR>Try thou the strength of Caeneus: at the word
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>He thrust; and in his shoulder plung'd the sword.
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>Then writh'd his hand; and as he drove it down,
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>Deep in his breast, made many wounds in one.
<A NAME="690"></A><BR><BR>The centaurs saw, inrag'd, th' unhop'd success;
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>And rushing on in crowds, together press;
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>At him, and him alone, their darts they threw:
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>Repuls'd they from his fated body flew.
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>Amaz'd they stood; 'till Monichus began,
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>O shame, a nation conquer'd by a man!
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>A woman-man! yet more a man is he,
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>Than all our race; and what he was, are we.
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>Now, what avail our nerves? th' united force,
<A NAME="699"></A><BR>Of two the strongest creatures, man and horse;
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>Nor Goddess-born; nor of Ixion's seed
<A NAME="701"></A><BR>We seem (a lover built for Juno's bed);
<A NAME="702"></A><BR>Master'd by this half man. Whole mountains throw
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>With woods at once, and bury him below.
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>This only way remains. Nor need we doubt
<A NAME="705"></A><BR>To choak the soul within; though not to force it 
<A NAME="706"></A>out:
<A NAME="707"></A><BR>Heap weights, instead of wounds. He chanc'd to see
<A NAME="708"></A><BR>Where southern storms had rooted up a tree;
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>This, rais'd from Earth, against the foe he threw;
<A NAME="710"></A><BR>Th' example shewn, his fellow-brutes pursue.
<A NAME="711"></A><BR>With forest-loads the warrior they invade;
<A NAME="712"></A><BR>Othrys, and Pelion soon were void of shade;
<A NAME="713"></A><BR>And spreading groves were naked mountains made.
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>Press'd with the burden, Caeneus pants for breath;
<A NAME="715"></A><BR>And on his shoulders bears the wooden death.
<A NAME="716"></A><BR>To heave th' intolerable weight he tries;
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>At length it rose above his mouth and eyes:
<A NAME="718"></A><BR>Yet still he heaves; and, strugling with despair,
<A NAME="719"></A><BR>Shakes all aside, and gains a gulp of air:
<A NAME="720"></A><BR>A short relief, which but prolongs his pain;
<A NAME="721"></A><BR>He faints by fits; and then respires again:
<A NAME="722"></A><BR>At last, the burden only nods above,
<A NAME="723"></A><BR>As when an earthquake stirs th' Idaean grove.
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>Doubtful his death: he suffocated seem'd,
<A NAME="725"></A><BR>To most; but otherwise our Mopsus deem'd,
<A NAME="726"></A><BR>Who said he saw a yellow bird arise
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>From out the piles, and cleave the liquid skies:
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>I saw it too, with golden feathers bright;
<A NAME="729"></A><BR>Nor e'er before beheld so strange a sight.
<A NAME="730"></A><BR>Whom Mopsus viewing, as it soar'd around
<A NAME="731"></A><BR>Our troop, and heard the pinions' rattling sound,
<A NAME="732"></A><BR>All hail, he cry'd, thy country's grace and love!
<A NAME="733"></A><BR>Once first of men below, now first of birds above.
<A NAME="734"></A><BR>Its author to the story gave belief:
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>For us, our courage was increas'd by grief:
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>Asham'd to see a single man, pursu'd
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>With odds, to sink beneath a multitude,
<A NAME="738"></A><BR>We push'd the foe: and forc'd to shameful flight,
<A NAME="739"></A><BR>Part fell, and part escap'd by favour of the night.
<A NAME="740"></A><BR><BR><B>The Fate of Periclymenos</B>
<A NAME="741"></A><BR><BR>This tale, by Nestor told, did much displease
<A NAME="742"></A><BR>Tlepolemus, the seed of Hercules:
<A NAME="743"></A><BR>For, often he had heard his father say,
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>That he himself was present at the fray;
<A NAME="745"></A><BR>And more than shar'd the glories of the day.
<A NAME="746"></A><BR><BR>Old Chronicle, he said, among the rest,
<A NAME="747"></A><BR>You might have nam'd Alcides at the least:
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>Is he not worth your praise? The Pylian prince
<A NAME="749"></A><BR>Sigh'd ere he spoke; then made this proud defence.
<A NAME="750"></A><BR>My former woes in long oblivion drown'd,
<A NAME="751"></A><BR>I wou'd have lost; but you renew the wound:
<A NAME="752"></A><BR>Better to pass him o'er, than to relate
<A NAME="753"></A><BR>The cause I have your mighty sire to hate.
<A NAME="754"></A><BR>His fame has fill'd the world, and reach'd the sky
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>(Which, oh, I wish, with truth, I cou'd deny!);
<A NAME="756"></A><BR>We praise not Hector; though his name, we know,
<A NAME="757"></A><BR>Is great in arms; 'tis hard to praise a foe.
<A NAME="758"></A><BR><BR>He, your great father, levell'd to the ground
<A NAME="759"></A><BR>Messenia's tow'rs: nor better fortune found
<A NAME="760"></A><BR>Elis, and Pylos; that a neighb'ring state,
<A NAME="761"></A><BR>And this my own: both guiltless of their fate.
<A NAME="762"></A><BR><BR>To pass the rest, twelve, wanting one, he slew;
<A NAME="763"></A><BR>My brethren, who their birth from Neleus drew,
<A NAME="764"></A><BR>All youths of early promise, had they liv'd;
<A NAME="765"></A><BR>By him they perish'd: I alone surviv'd.
<A NAME="766"></A><BR>The rest were easie conquest: but the fate
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>Of Periclymenos, is wondrous to relate.
<A NAME="768"></A><BR>To him, our common grandsire of the main
<A NAME="769"></A><BR>Had giv'n to change his form, and chang'd, resume 
<A NAME="770"></A>again.
<A NAME="771"></A><BR>Vary'd at pleasure, every shape he try'd;
<A NAME="772"></A><BR>And in all beasts, Alcides still defy'd:
<A NAME="773"></A><BR>Vanquish'd on Earth, at length he soar'd above;
<A NAME="774"></A><BR>Chang'd to the bird, that bears the bolt of Jove:
<A NAME="775"></A><BR>The new-dissembled eagle, now endu'd
<A NAME="776"></A><BR>With beak, and pounces, Hercules pursu'd,
<A NAME="777"></A><BR>And cuff'd his manly cheeks, and tore his face;
<A NAME="778"></A><BR>Then, safe retir'd, and tour'd in empty space.
<A NAME="779"></A><BR>Alcides bore not long his flying foe;
<A NAME="780"></A><BR>But bending his inevitable bow,
<A NAME="781"></A><BR>Reach'd him in air, suspended as he stood;
<A NAME="782"></A><BR>And in his pinion fix'd the feather'd wood.
<A NAME="783"></A><BR>Light was the wound; but in the sinew hung
<A NAME="784"></A><BR>The point, and his disabled wing unstrung.
<A NAME="785"></A><BR>He wheel'd in air, and stretch'd his vans in vain;
<A NAME="786"></A><BR>His vans no longer cou'd his flight sustain:
<A NAME="787"></A><BR>For while one gather'd wind, one unsupply'd
<A NAME="788"></A><BR>Hung drooping down, nor pois'd his other side.
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>He fell: the shaft that slightly was impress'd,
<A NAME="790"></A><BR>Now from his heavy fall with weight increas'd,
<A NAME="791"></A><BR>Drove through his neck, aslant, he spurns the ground,
<A NAME="792"></A><BR>And the soul issues through the weazon's wound.
<A NAME="793"></A><BR><BR>Now, brave commander of the Rhodian seas,
<A NAME="794"></A><BR>What praise is due from me, to Hercules?
<A NAME="795"></A><BR>Silence is all the vengeance I decree
<A NAME="796"></A><BR>For my slain brothers; but 'tis peace with thee.
<A NAME="797"></A><BR><BR>Thus with a flowing tongue old Nestor spoke:
<A NAME="798"></A><BR>Then, to full bowls each other they provoke:
<A NAME="799"></A><BR>At length, with weariness, and wine oppress'd,
<A NAME="800"></A><BR>They rise from table; and withdraw to rest.
<A NAME="801"></A><BR><BR><B>The Death of Achilles</B>
<A NAME="802"></A><BR><BR>The sire of Cygnus, monarch of the main,
<A NAME="803"></A><BR>Mean-time, laments his son, in battel slain,
<A NAME="804"></A><BR>And vows the victor's death; nor vows in vain.
<A NAME="805"></A><BR>For nine long years the smother'd pain he bore
<A NAME="806"></A><BR>(Achilles was not ripe for Fate before):
<A NAME="807"></A><BR>Then when he saw the promis'd hour was near,
<A NAME="808"></A><BR>He thus bespoke the God, that guides the year:
<A NAME="809"></A><BR>Immortal offspring of my brother Jove;
<A NAME="810"></A><BR>My brightest nephew, and whom best I love,
<A NAME="811"></A><BR>Whose hands were join'd with mine, to raise the 
<A NAME="812"></A>wall
<A NAME="813"></A><BR>Of tott'ring Troy, now nodding to her fall,
<A NAME="814"></A><BR>Dost thou not mourn our pow'r employ'd in vain;
<A NAME="815"></A><BR>And the defenders of our city slain?
<A NAME="816"></A><BR>To pass the rest, could noble Hector lie
<A NAME="817"></A><BR>Unpity'd, drag'd around his native Troy?
<A NAME="818"></A><BR>And yet the murd'rer lives: himself by far
<A NAME="819"></A><BR>A greater plague, than all the wasteful war:
<A NAME="820"></A><BR>He lives; the proud Pelides lives, to boast
<A NAME="821"></A><BR>Our town destroy'd, our common labour lost.
<A NAME="822"></A><BR>O, could I meet him! But I wish too late:
<A NAME="823"></A><BR>To prove my trident is not in his Fate!
<A NAME="824"></A><BR>But let him try (for that's allow'd) thy dart,
<A NAME="825"></A><BR>And pierce his only penetrable part.
<A NAME="826"></A><BR><BR>Apollo bows to the superior throne;
<A NAME="827"></A><BR>And to his uncle's anger, adds his own.
<A NAME="828"></A><BR>Then in a cloud involv'd, he takes his flight,
<A NAME="829"></A><BR>Where Greeks, and Trojans mix'd in mortal fight;
<A NAME="830"></A><BR>And found out Paris, lurking where he stood,
<A NAME="831"></A><BR>And stain'd his arrows with plebeian blood:
<A NAME="832"></A><BR>Phoebus to him alone the God confess'd,
<A NAME="833"></A><BR>Then to the recreant knight, he thus address'd.
<A NAME="834"></A><BR>Dost thou not blush, to spend thy shafts in vain
<A NAME="835"></A><BR>On a degenerate, and ignoble train?
<A NAME="836"></A><BR>If fame, or better vengeance be thy care,
<A NAME="837"></A><BR>There aim: and, with one arrow, end the war.
<A NAME="838"></A><BR><BR>He said; and shew'd from far the blazing shield
<A NAME="839"></A><BR>And sword, which, but Achilles, none cou'd wield;
<A NAME="840"></A><BR>And how he mov'd a God, and mow'd the standing field.
<A NAME="841"></A><BR>The deity himself directs aright
<A NAME="842"></A><BR>Th' invenom'd shaft; and wings the fatal flight.
<A NAME="843"></A><BR><BR>Thus fell the foremost of the Grecian name;
<A NAME="844"></A><BR>And he, the base adult'rer, boasts the fame.
<A NAME="845"></A><BR>A spectacle to glad the Trojan train;
<A NAME="846"></A><BR>And please old Priam, after Hector slain.
<A NAME="847"></A><BR>If by a female hand he had foreseen
<A NAME="848"></A><BR>He was to die, his wish had rather been
<A NAME="849"></A><BR>The lance, and double ax of the fair warriour queen.
<A NAME="850"></A><BR>And now the terror of the Trojan field,
<A NAME="851"></A><BR>The Grecian honour, ornament, and shield,
<A NAME="852"></A><BR>High on a pile, th' unconquer'd chief is plac'd,
<A NAME="853"></A><BR>The God that arm'd him first, consum'd at last.
<A NAME="854"></A><BR>Of all the mighty man, the small remains
<A NAME="855"></A><BR>A little urn, and scarcely fill'd, contains.
<A NAME="856"></A><BR>Yet great in Homer, still Achilles lives;
<A NAME="857"></A><BR>And equal to himself, himself survives.
<A NAME="858"></A><BR><BR>His buckler owns its former lord; and brings
<A NAME="859"></A><BR>New cause of strife, betwixt contending kings;
<A NAME="860"></A><BR>Who worthi'st after him, his sword to wield,
<A NAME="861"></A><BR>Or wear his armour, or sustain his shield.
<A NAME="862"></A><BR>Ev'n Diomede sat mute, with down-cast eyes;
<A NAME="863"></A><BR>Conscious of wanted worth to win the prize:
<A NAME="864"></A><BR>Nor Menelaus presum'd these arms to claim,
<A NAME="865"></A><BR>Nor he the king of men, a greater name.
<A NAME="866"></A><BR>Two rivals only rose: Laertes' son,
<A NAME="867"></A><BR>And the vast bulk of Ajax Telamon:
<A NAME="868"></A><BR>The king, who cherish'd each with equal love,
<A NAME="869"></A><BR>And from himself all envy wou'd remove,
<A NAME="870"></A><BR>Left both to be determin'd by the laws;
<A NAME="871"></A><BR>And to the Graecian chiefs transferr'd the cause.
