<A NAME="10"></A><B>The Story of Phaeton</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>The Sun's bright palace, on high columns rais'd,
<A NAME="12"></A><BR>With burnish'd gold and flaming jewels blaz'd;
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>The folding gates diffus'd a silver light,
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>And with a milder gleam refresh'd the sight;
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>Of polish'd iv'ry was the cov'ring wrought:
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>The matter vied not with the sculptor's thought,
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>For in the portal was display'd on high
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>(The work of Vulcan) a fictitious sky;
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>A waving sea th' inferiour Earth embrac'd,
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>And Gods and Goddesses the waters grac'd.
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>Aegeon here a mighty whale bestrode;
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>Triton, and Proteus (the deceiving God)
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>With Doris here were carv'd, and all her train,
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>Some loosely swimming in the figur'd main,
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>While some on rocks their dropping hair divide,
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>And some on fishes through the waters glide:
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>Tho' various features did the sisters grace,
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>A sister's likeness was in ev'ry face.
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>On Earth a diff'rent landskip courts the eyes,
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>Men, towns, and beasts in distant prospects rise,
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>And nymphs, and streams, and woods, and rural deities.
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>O'er all, the Heav'n's refulgent image shines;
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>On either gate were six engraven signs.
<A NAME="34"></A><BR><BR>Here Phaeton still gaining on th' ascent,
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>To his suspected father's palace went,
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>'Till pressing forward through the bright abode,
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>He saw at distance the illustrious God:
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>He saw at distance, or the dazling light
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>Had flash'd too strongly on his aking sight.
<A NAME="40"></A><BR><BR>The God sits high, exalted on a throne
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>Of blazing gems, with purple garments on;
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>The Hours, in order rang'd on either hand,
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>And Days, and Months, and Years, and Ages stand.
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>Here Spring appears with flow'ry chaplets bound;
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>Here Summer in her wheaten garland crown'd;
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>Here Autumn the rich trodden grapes besmear;
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>And hoary Winter shivers in the reer.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>Phoebus beheld the youth from off his throne;
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>That eye, which looks on all, was fix'd in one.
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>He saw the boy's confusion in his face,
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>Surpriz'd at all the wonders of the place;
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>And cries aloud, "What wants my son? for know
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>My son thou art, and I must call thee so."
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>"Light of the world," the trembling youth replies,
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>"Illustrious parent! since you don't despise
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>The parent's name, some certain token give,
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>That I may Clymene's proud boast believe,
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>Nor longer under false reproaches grieve."
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR>The tender sire was touch'd with what he said,
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>And flung the blaze of glories from his head,
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>And bid the youth advance: "My son," said he,
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>"Come to thy father's arms! for Clymene
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>Has told thee true; a parent's name I own,
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>And deem thee worthy to be called my son.
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>As a sure proof, make some request, and I,
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>Whate'er it be, with that request comply;
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>By Styx I swear, whose waves are hid in night,
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>And roul impervious to my piercing sight."
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>The youth transported, asks, without delay,
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>To guide the sun's bright chariot for a day.
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>The God repented of the oath he took,
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>For anguish thrice his radiant head he shook;
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>"My son," says he, "some other proof require,
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>Rash was my promise, rash is thy desire.
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>I'd fain deny this wish, which thou hast made,
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>Or, what I can't deny, wou'd fain disswade.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>Too vast and hazardous the task appears,
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>Nor suited to thy strength, nor to thy years.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>Thy lot is mortal, but thy wishes fly
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>Beyond the province of mortality:
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>There is not one of all the Gods that dares
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>(However skill'd in other great affairs)
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>To mount the burning axle-tree, but I;
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>Not Jove himself, the ruler of the sky,
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>That hurles the three-fork'd thunder from above,
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>Dares try his strength: yet who so strong as Jove?
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>The steeds climb up the first ascent with pain,
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>And when the middle firmament they gain,
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>If downward from the Heav'ns my head I bow,
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>And see the Earth and Ocean hang below,
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>Ev'n I am seiz'd with horror and affright,
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>And my own heart misgives me at the sight.
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>A mighty downfal steeps the ev'ning stage,
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>And steddy reins must curb the horses' rage.
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>Tethys herself has fear'd to see me driv'n
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>Down headlong from the precipice of Heav'n.
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>Besides, consider what impetuous force
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>Turns stars and planets in a diff'rent course.
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>I steer against their motions; nor am I
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>Born back by all the current of the sky.
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>But how cou'd you resist the orbs that roul
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>In adverse whirls, and stem the rapid pole?
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>But you perhaps may hope for pleasing woods,
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>And stately dooms, and cities fill'd with Gods;
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>While through a thousand snares your progress lies,
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>Where forms of starry monsters stock the skies:
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>For, shou'd you hit the doubtful way aright,
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>The bull with stooping horns stands opposite;
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>Next him the bright Haemonian bow is strung,
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>And next, the lion's grinning visage hung:
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>The scorpion's claws, here clasp a wide extent;
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>And here the crab's in lesser clasps are bent.
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>Nor wou'd you find it easie to compose
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>The mettled steeds, when from their nostrils flows
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>The scorching fire, that in their entrails glows.
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>Ev'n I their head-strong fury scarce restrain,
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>When they grow warm and restif to the rein.
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>Let not my son a fatal gift require,
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>But, O! in time, recall your rash desire;
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>You ask a gift that may your parent tell,
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>Let these my fears your parentage reveal;
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>And learn a father from a father's care:
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>Look on my face; or if my heart lay bare,
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>Cou'd you but look, you'd read the father there.
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>Chuse out a gift from seas, or Earth, or skies,
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>For open to your wish all Nature lies,
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>Only decline this one unequal task,
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>For 'tis a mischief, not a gift, you ask.
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>You ask a real mischief, Phaeton:
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>Nay hang not thus about my neck, my son:
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>I grant your wish, and Styx has heard my voice,
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>Chuse what you will, but make a wiser choice."
<A NAME="133"></A><BR><BR>Thus did the God th' unwary youth advise;
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>But he still longs to travel through the skies.
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>When the fond father (for in vain he pleads)
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>At length to the Vulcanian Chariot leads.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>A golden axle did the work uphold,
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>Gold was the beam, the wheels were orb'd with gold.
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>The spokes in rows of silver pleas'd the sight,
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>The seat with party-colour'd gems was bright;
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>Apollo shin'd amid the glare of light.
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>The youth with secret joy the work surveys,
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>When now the moon disclos'd her purple rays;
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>The stars were fled, for Lucifer had chased
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>The stars away, and fled himself at last.
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>Soon as the father saw the rosy morn,
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>And the moon shining with a blunter horn,
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>He bid the nimble Hours, without delay,
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>Bring forth the steeds; the nimble Hours obey:
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>From their full racks the gen'rous steeds retire,
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>Dropping ambrosial foams, and snorting fire.
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>Still anxious for his son, the God of day,
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>To make him proof against the burning ray,
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>His temples with celestial ointment wet,
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>Of sov'reign virtue to repel the heat;
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>Then fix'd the beamy circle on his head,
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>And fetch'd a deep foreboding sigh, and said,
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>"Take this at least, this last advice, my son,
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>Keep a stiff rein, and move but gently on:
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>The coursers of themselves will run too fast,
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>Your art must be to moderate their haste.
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>Drive 'em not on directly through the skies,
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>But where the Zodiac's winding circle lies,
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>Along the midmost Zone; but sally forth
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>Nor to the distant south, nor stormy north.
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>The horses' hoofs a beaten track will show,
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>But neither mount too high, nor sink too low.
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>That no new fires, or Heav'n or Earth infest;
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>Keep the mid way, the middle way is best.
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>Nor, where in radiant folds the serpent twines,
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>Direct your course, nor where the altar shines.
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>Shun both extreams; the rest let Fortune guide,
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>And better for thee than thy self provide!
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>See, while I speak, the shades disperse away,
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>Aurora gives the promise of a day;
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>I'm call'd, nor can I make a longer stay.
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>Snatch up the reins; or still th' attempt forsake,
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>And not my chariot, but my counsel, take,
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>While yet securely on the Earth you stand;
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>Nor touch the horses with too rash a hand.
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>Let me alone to light the world, while you
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>Enjoy those beams which you may safely view."
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>He spoke in vain; the youth with active heat
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>And sprightly vigour vaults into the seat;
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>And joys to hold the reins, and fondly gives
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>Those thanks his father with remorse receives.
<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR>Mean-while the restless horses neigh'd aloud,
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>Breathing out fire, and pawing where they stood.
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>Tethys, not knowing what had past, gave way,
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>And all the waste of Heav'n before 'em lay.
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>They spring together out, and swiftly bear
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>The flying youth thro' clouds and yielding air;
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>With wingy speed outstrip the eastern wind,
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>And leave the breezes of the morn behind.
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>The youth was light, nor cou'd he fill the seat,
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>Or poise the chariot with its wonted weight:
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>But as at sea th' unballass'd vessel rides,
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>Cast to and fro, the sport of winds and tides;
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>So in the bounding chariot toss'd on high,
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>The youth is hurry'd headlong through the sky.
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>Soon as the steeds perceive it, they forsake
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>Their stated course, and leave the beaten track.
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>The youth was in a maze, nor did he know
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>Which way to turn the reins, or where to go;
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>Nor wou'd the horses, had he known, obey.
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>Then the sev'n stars first felt Apollo's ray,
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>And wish'd to dip in the forbidden sea.
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>The folded serpent next the frozen pole,
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>Stiff and benum'd before, began to rowle,
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>And raged with inward heat, and threaten'd war,
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>And shot a redder light from ev'ry star;
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>Nay, and 'tis said Bootes too, that fain
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>Thou woud'st have fled, tho' cumber'd with thy wane.
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR>Th' unhappy youth then, bending down his head,
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>Saw Earth and Ocean far beneath him spread.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>His colour chang'd, he startled at the sight,
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>And his eyes darken'd by too great a light.
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>Now cou'd he wish the fiery steeds untry'd,
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>His birth obscure, and his request deny'd:
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>Now wou'd he Merops for his father own,
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>And quit his boasted kindred to the sun.
<A NAME="222"></A><BR><BR>So fares the pilot, when his ship is tost
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>In troubled seas, and all its steerage lost,
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>He gives her to the winds, and in despair
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>Seeks his last refuge in the Gods and pray'r.
<A NAME="226"></A><BR><BR>What cou'd he do? his eyes, if backward cast,
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>Find a long path he had already past;
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>If forward, still a longer path they find:
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>Both he compares, and measures in his mind;
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>And sometimes casts an eye upon the east,
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>And sometimes looks on the forbidden west,
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>The horses' names he knew not in the fright,
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>Nor wou'd he loose the reins, nor cou'd he hold 'em 
<A NAME="234"></A>right.
<A NAME="235"></A><BR><BR>Now all the horrors of the Heav'ns he spies,
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>And monstrous shadows of prodigious size,
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>That, deck'd with stars, lye scatter'd o'er the 
<A NAME="238"></A>skies.
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>There is a place above, where Scorpio bent
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>In tail and arms surrounds a vast extent;
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>In a wide circuit of the Heav'ns he shines,
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>And fills the space of two coelestial signs.
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>Soon as the youth beheld him vex'd with heat
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>Brandish his sting, and in his poison sweat,
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>Half dead with sudden fear he dropt the reins;
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>The horses felt 'em loose upon their mains,
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>And, flying out through all the plains above,
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>Ran uncontroul'd where-e're their fury drove;
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>Rush'd on the stars, and through a pathless way
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>Of unknown regions hurry'd on the day.
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>And now above, and now below they flew,
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>And near the Earth the burning chariot drew.
<A NAME="253"></A><BR><BR>The clouds disperse in fumes, the wond'ring 
<A NAME="254"></A>Moon
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>Beholds her brother's steeds beneath her own;
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>The highlands smoak, cleft by the piercing rays,
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>Or, clad with woods, in their own fewel blaze.
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>Next o'er the plains, where ripen'd harvests grow,
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>The running conflagration spreads below.
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>But these are trivial ills: whole cities burn,
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>And peopled kingdoms into ashes turn.
<A NAME="262"></A><BR><BR>The mountains kindle as the car draws near,
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>Athos and Tmolus red with fires appear;
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>Oeagrian Haemus (then a single name)
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>And virgin Helicon increase the flame;
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>Taurus and Oete glare amid the sky,
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>And Ida, spight of all her fountains, dry.
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>Eryx and Othrys, and Cithaeron, glow,
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>And Rhodope, no longer cloath'd in snow;
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>High Pindus, Mimas, and Parnassus, sweat,
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>And Aetna rages with redoubled heat.
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>Ev'n Scythia, through her hoary regions warm'd,
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>In vain with all her native frost was arm'd.
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>Cover'd with flames the tow'ring Appennine,
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>And Caucasus, and proud Olympus, shine;
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>And, where the long-extended Alpes aspire,
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>Now stands a huge continu'd range of fire.
<A NAME="278"></A><BR><BR>Th' astonisht youth, where-e'er his eyes cou'd 
<A NAME="279"></A>turn,
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>Beheld the universe around him burn:
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>The world was in a blaze; nor cou'd he bear
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>The sultry vapours and the scorching air,
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>Which from below, as from a furnace, flow'd;
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>And now the axle-tree beneath him glow'd:
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>Lost in the whirling clouds that round him broke,
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>And white with ashes, hov'ring in the smoke.
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>He flew where-e'er the horses drove, nor knew
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>Whither the horses drove, or where he flew.
<A NAME="289"></A><BR><BR>'Twas then, they say, the swarthy Moor begun
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>To change his hue, and blacken in the sun.
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>Then Libya first, of all her moisture drain'd,
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>Became a barren waste, a wild of sand.
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>The water-nymphs lament their empty urns,
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>Boeotia, robb's of silve Dirce, mourns,
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>Corinth Pyrene's wasted spring bewails,
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>And Argos grieves whilst Amymone fails.
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR>The floods are drain'd from ev'ry distant coast,
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>Ev'n Tanais, tho' fix'd in ice, was lost.
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>Enrag'd Caicus and Lycormas roar,
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>And Xanthus, fated to be burnt once more.
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>The fam'd Maeander, that unweary'd strays
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>Through mazy windings, smoaks in ev'ry maze.
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>From his lov'd Babylon Euphrates flies;
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>The big-swoln Ganges and the Danube rise
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>In thick'ning fumes, and darken half the skies.
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>In flames Ismenos and the Phasis roul'd,
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>And Tagus floating in his melted gold.
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>The swans, that on Cayster often try'd
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>Their tuneful songs, now sung their last and dy'd.
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>The frighted Nile ran off, and under ground
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>Conceal'd his head, nor can it yet be found:
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>His sev'n divided currents all are dry,
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>And where they row'ld, sev'n gaping trenches lye:
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>No more the Rhine or Rhone their course maintain,
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>Nor Tiber, of his promis'd empire vain.
<A NAME="316"></A><BR><BR>The ground, deep-cleft, admits the dazling ray,
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>And startles Pluto with the flash of day.
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>The seas shrink in, and to the sight disclose
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>Wide naked plains, where once their billows rose;
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>Their rocks are all discover'd, and increase
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>The number of the scatter'd Cyclades.
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>The fish in sholes about the bottom creep,
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>Nor longer dares the crooked dolphin leap
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>Gasping for breath, th' unshapen Phocae die,
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>And on the boiling wave extended lye.
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>Nereus, and Doris with her virgin train,
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>Seek out the last recesses of the main;
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>Beneath unfathomable depths they faint,
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>And secret in their gloomy caverns pant.
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>Stern Neptune thrice above the waves upheld
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>His face, and thrice was by the flames repell'd.
<A NAME="332"></A><BR><BR>The Earth at length, on ev'ry side embrac'd
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>With scalding seas that floated round her waste,
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>When now she felt the springs and rivers come,
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>And crowd within the hollow of her womb,
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>Up-lifted to the Heav'ns her blasted head,
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>And clapt her hand upon her brows, and said
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>(But first, impatient of the sultry heat,
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>Sunk deeper down, and sought a cooler seat):
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>"If you, great king of Gods, my death approve,
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>And I deserve it, let me die by Jove;
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>If I must perish by the force of fire,
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>Let me transfix'd with thunder-bolts expire.
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>See, whilst I speak, my breath the vapours choak
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>(For now her face lay wrapt in clouds of smoak),
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>See my singe'd hair, behold my faded eye,
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>And wither'd face, where heaps of cinders lye!
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>And does the plow for this my body tear?
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>This the reward for all the fruits I bear,
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>Tortur'd with rakes, and harrass'd all the year?
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>That herbs for cattle daily I renew,
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>And food for Man, and frankincense for you?
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>But grant me guilty; what has Neptune done?
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>Why are his waters boiling in the sun?
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>The wavy empire, which by lot was giv'n,
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>Why does it waste, and further shrink from Heav'n?
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>If I nor he your pity can provoke,
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>See your own Heav'ns, the Heav'ns begin to smoke!
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>Shou'd once the sparkles catch those bright abodes,
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>Destruction seizes on the Heav'ns and Gods;
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>Atlas becomes unequal to his freight,
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>And almost faints beneath the glowing weight.
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>If Heav'n, and Earth, and sea, together burn,
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>All must again into their chaos turn.
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>Apply some speedy cure, prevent our fate,
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>And succour Nature, ere it be too late."
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>She cea'sd, for choak'd with vapours round her spread,
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>Down to the deepest shades she sunk her head.
<A NAME="369"></A><BR><BR>Jove call'd to witness ev'ry Pow'r above,
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>And ev'n the God, whose son the chariot drove,
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>That what he acts he is compell'd to do,
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>Or universal ruin must ensue.
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>Strait he ascends the high aetherial throne,
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>From whence he us'd to dart his thunder down,
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>From whence his show'rs and storms he us'd to pour,
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>But now cou'd meet with neither storm nor show'r.
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>Then, aiming at the youth, with lifted hand,
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>Full at his head he hurl'd the forky brand,
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>In dreadful thund'rings. Thus th' almighty sire
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>Suppress'd the raging of the fires with fire.
<A NAME="381"></A><BR><BR>At once from life and from the chariot driv'n,
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>Th' ambitious boy fell thunder-struck from Heav'n.
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>The horses started with a sudden bound,
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>And flung the reins and chariot to the ground:
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>The studded harness from their necks they broke,
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>Here fell a wheel, and here a silver spoke,
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>Here were the beam and axle torn away;
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>And, scatter'd o'er the Earth, the shining fragments 
<A NAME="389"></A>lay.
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>The breathless Phaeton, with flaming hair,
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>Shot from the chariot, like a falling star,
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>That in a summer's ev'ning from the top
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>Of Heav'n drops down, or seems at least to drop;
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>'Till on the Po his blasted corps was hurl'd,
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>Far from his country, in the western world.
<A NAME="396"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaeton's Sisters transform'd into Trees</B>
<A NAME="397"></A><BR><BR>The Latian nymphs came round him, and, amaz'd,
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>On the dead youth, transfix'd with thunder, gaz'd;
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>And, whilst yet smoaking from the bolt he lay,
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>His shatter'd body to a tomb convey,
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>And o'er the tomb an epitaph devise:
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>"Here he, who drove the sun's bright chariot, lies;
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>His father's fiery steeds he cou'd not guide,
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>But in the glorious enterprize he dy'd."
<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR>Apollo hid his face, and pin'd for grief,
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>And, if the story may deserve belief,
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>The space of one whole day is said to run,
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>From morn to wonted ev'n, without a sun:
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>The burning ruins, with a fainter ray,
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>Supply the sun, and counterfeit a day,
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>A day, that still did Nature's face disclose:
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>This comfort from the mighty mischief rose.
<A NAME="413"></A><BR><BR>But Clymene, enrag'd with grief, laments,
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>And as her grief inspires, her passion vents:
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>Wild for her son, and frantick in her woes,
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>With hair dishevel'd round the world she goes,
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>To seek where-e'er his body might be cast;
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>'Till, on the borders of the Po, at last
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>The name inscrib'd on the new tomb appears.
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>The dear dear name she bathes in flowing tears,
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>Hangs o'er the tomb, unable to depart,
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>And hugs the marble to her throbbing heart.
<A NAME="423"></A><BR><BR>Her daughters too lament, and sigh, and mourn
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>(A fruitless tribute to their brother's urn),
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>And beat their naked bosoms, and complain,
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>And call aloud for Phaeton in vain:
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>All the long night their mournful watch they keep,
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>And all the day stand round the tomb, and weep.
<A NAME="429"></A><BR><BR>Four times, revolving, the full moon return'd;
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>So long the mother and the daughters mourn'd:
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>When now the eldest, Phaethusa, strove
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>To rest her weary limbs, but could not move;
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>Lampetia wou'd have help'd her, but she found
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>Her self with-held, and rooted to the ground:
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>A third in wild affliction, as she grieves,
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>Wou'd rend her hair, but fills her hands with leaves;
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>One sees her thighs transform'd, another views
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>Her arms shot out, and branching into boughs.
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>And now their legs, and breasts, and bodies stood
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>Crusted with bark, and hard'ning into wood;
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>But still above were female heads display'd,
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>And mouths, that call'd the mother to their aid.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>What cou'd, alas! the weeping mother do?
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>From this to that with eager haste she flew,
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>And kiss'd her sprouting daughters as they grew.
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>She tears the bark that to each body cleaves,
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>And from their verdant fingers strips the leaves:
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>The blood came trickling, where she tore away
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>The leaves and bark: the maids were heard to say,
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>"Forbear, mistaken parent, oh! forbear;
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>A wounded daughter in each tree you tear;
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>Farewell for ever." Here the bark encreas'd,
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>Clos'd on their faces, and their words suppress'd.
<A NAME="454"></A><BR><BR>The new-made trees in tears of amber run,
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>Which, harden'd into value by the sun,
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>Distill for ever on the streams below:
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>The limpid streams their radiant treasure show,
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>Mixt in the sand; whence the rich drops convey'd
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>Shine in the dress of the bright Latian maid.
<A NAME="460"></A><BR><BR><B>The Transformation of Cycnus into a Swan</B>
<A NAME="461"></A><BR><BR>Cycnus beheld the nymphs transform'd, ally'd
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>To their dead brother on the mortal side,
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>In friendship and affection nearer bound;
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>He left the cities and the realms he own'd,
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>Thro' pathless fields and lonely shores to range,
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>And woods made thicker by the sisters' change.
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>Whilst here, within the dismal gloom, alone,
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>The melancholy monarch made his moan,
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>His voice was lessen'd, as he try'd to speak,
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>And issu'd through a long-extended neck;
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>His hair transforms to down, his fingers meet
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>In skinny films, and shape his oary feet;
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>From both his sides the wings and feathers break;
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>And from his mouth proceeds a blunted beak:
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>All Cycnus now into a Swan was turn'd,
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>Who, still remembring how his kinsman burn'd,
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>To solitary pools and lakes retires,
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>And loves the waters as oppos'd to fires.
<A NAME="479"></A><BR><BR>Mean-while Apollo in a gloomy shade
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>(The native lustre of his brows decay'd)
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>Indulging sorrow, sickens at the sight
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>Of his own sun-shine, and abhors the light;
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>The hidden griefs, that in his bosom rise,
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>Sadden his looks and over-cast his eyes,
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>As when some dusky orb obstructs his ray,
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>And sullies in a dim eclipse the day.
<A NAME="487"></A><BR><BR>Now secretly with inward griefs he pin'd,
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>Now warm resentments to his griefs he joyn'd,
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>And now renounc'd his office to mankind.
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>"Ere since the birth of time," said he, "I've born
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>A long ungrateful toil, without return;
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>Let now some other manage, if he dare,
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>The fiery steeds, and mount the burning carr;
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>Or, if none else, let Jove his fortune try,
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>And learn to lay his murd'ring thunder by;
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>Then will he own, perhaps, but own too late,
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>My son deserv'd not so severe a fate."
<A NAME="498"></A><BR><BR>The Gods stand round him, as he mourns, and 
<A NAME="499"></A>pray
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>He would resume the conduct of the day,
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>Nor let the world be lost in endless night:
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>Jove too himself descending from his height,
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>Excuses what had happen'd, and intreats,
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>Majestically mixing pray'rs and threats.
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>Prevail'd upon at length, again he took
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>The harness'd steeds, that still with horror shook,
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>And plies 'em with the lash, and whips 'em on,
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>And, as he whips, upbraids 'em with his son.
<A NAME="509"></A><BR><BR><B>The Story of Calisto</B>
<A NAME="510"></A><BR><BR>The day was settled in its course; and Jove
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>Walk'd the wide circuit of the Heavens above,
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>To search if any cracks or flaws were made;
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>But all was safe: the Earth he then survey'd,
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>And cast an eye on ev'ry diff'rent coast,
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>And ev'ry land; but on Arcadia most.
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>Her fields he cloath'd, and chear'd her blasted 
<A NAME="517"></A>face
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>With running fountains, and with springing grass.
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>No tracks of Heav'n's destructive fire remain,
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>The fields and woods revive, and Nature smiles again.
<A NAME="521"></A><BR><BR>But as the God walk'd to and fro the Earth,
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>And rais'd the plants, and gave the spring its birth,
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>By chance a fair Arcadian nymph he view'd,
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>And felt the lovely charmer in his blood.
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>The nymph nor spun, nor dress'd with artful pride,
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>Her vest was gather'd up, her hair was ty'd;
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>Now in her hand a slender spear she bore,
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>Now a light quiver on her shoulders wore;
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>To chaste Diana from her youth inclin'd,
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>The sprightly warriors of the wood she joyn'd.
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>Diana too the gentle huntress lov'd,
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>Nor was there one of all the nymphs that rov'd
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>O'er Maenalus, amid the maiden throng,
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>More favour'd once; but favour lasts not long.
<A NAME="535"></A><BR><BR>The sun now shone in all its strength, and drove
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>The heated virgin panting to a grove;
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>The grove around a grateful shadow cast:
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>She dropt her arrows, and her bow unbrac'd;
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>She flung her self on the cool grassy bed;
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>And on the painted quiver rais'd her head,
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>Jove saw the charming huntress unprepar'd,
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>Stretch'd on the verdant turf, without a guard.
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>"Here I am safe," he cries, "from Juno's eye;
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>Or shou'd my jealous queen the theft descry,
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>Yet wou'd I venture on a theft like this,
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>And stand her rage for such, for such a bliss!"
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>Diana's shape and habit strait he took,
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>Soften'd his brows, and smooth'd his awful look,
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>And mildly in a female accent spoke.
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>"How fares my girl? How went the morning chase?"
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>To whom the virgin, starting from the grass,
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>"All hail, bright deity, whom I prefer
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>To Jove himself, tho' Jove himself were here."
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>The God was nearer than she thought, and heard
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>Well-pleas'd himself before himself preferr'd.
<A NAME="556"></A><BR><BR>He then salutes her with a warm embrace;
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>And, e're she half had told the morning chase,
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>With love enflam'd, and eager on his bliss,
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>Smother'd her words, and stop'd her with a kiss;
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>His kisses with unwonted ardour glow'd,
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>Nor cou'd Diana's shape conceal the God.
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>The virgin did whate'er a virgin cou'd
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>(Sure Juno must have pardon'd, had she view'd);
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>With all her might against his force she strove;
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>But how can mortal maids contend with Jove?
<A NAME="566"></A><BR><BR>Possest at length of what his heart desir'd,
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>Back to his Heav'ns, th' exulting God retir'd.
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>The lovely huntress, rising from the grass,
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>With down-cast eyes, and with a blushing face,
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>By shame confounded, and by fear dismay'd,
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>Flew from the covert of the guilty shade,
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>And almost, in the tumult of her mind,
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>Left her forgotten bow and shafts behind.
<A NAME="574"></A><BR><BR>But now Diana, with a sprightly train
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>Of quiver'd virgins, bounding o'er the plain,
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>Call'd to the nymph; the nymph began to fear
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>A second fraud, a Jove disguis'd in her;
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>But, when she saw the sister nymphs, suppress'd
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>Her rising fears, and mingled with the rest.
<A NAME="580"></A><BR><BR>How in the look does conscious guilt appear!
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>Slowly she mov'd, and loiter'd in the rear;
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>Nor lightly tripp'd, nor by the Goddess ran,
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>As once she us'd, the foremost of the train.
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>Her looks were flush'd, and sullen was her mien,
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>That sure the virgin Goddess (had she been
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>Aught but a virgin) must the guilt have seen.
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>'Tis said the nymphs saw all, and guess'd aright:
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>And now the moon had nine times lost her light,
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>When Dian, fainting in the mid-day beams,
<A NAME="590"></A><BR>Found a cool covert, and refreshing streams
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>That in soft murmurs through the forest flow'd,
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>And a smooth bed of shining gravel show'd.
<A NAME="593"></A><BR><BR>A covert so obscure, and streams so clear,
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>The Goddess prais'd: "And now no spies are near
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>Let's strip, my gentle maids, and wash," she cries.
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>Pleas'd with the motion, every maid complies;
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>Only the blushing huntress stood confus'd,
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>And form'd delays, and her delays excus'd;
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>In vain excus'd: her fellows round her press'd,
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>And the reluctant nymph by force undress'd,
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>The naked huntress all her shame reveal'd,
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>In vain her hands the pregnant womb conceal'd;
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>"Begone!" the Goddess cries with stern disdain,
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>"Begone! nor dare the hallow'd stream to stain":
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>She fled, for ever banish'd from the train.
<A NAME="606"></A><BR><BR>This Juno heard, who long had watch'd her time
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>To punish the detested rival's crime;
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>The time was come; for, to enrage her more,
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>A lovely boy the teeming rival bore.
<A NAME="610"></A><BR><BR>The Goddess cast a furious look, and cry'd,
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>"It is enough! I'm fully satisfy'd!
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>This boy shall stand a living mark, to prove
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>My husband's baseness and the strumpet's love:
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>But vengeance shall awake: those guilty charms
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>That drew the Thunderer from Juno's arms,
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>No longer shall their wonted force retain,
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>Nor please the God, nor make the mortal vain."
<A NAME="618"></A><BR><BR>This said, her hand within her hair she wound,
<A NAME="619"></A><BR>Swung her to Earth, and drag'd her on the ground:
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>The prostrate wretch lifts up her arms in pray'r;
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>Her arms grow shaggy, and deform'd with hair,
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>Her nails are sharpen'd into pointed claws,
<A NAME="623"></A><BR>Her hands bear half her weight, and turn to paws;
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>Her lips, that once cou'd tempt a God, begin
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>To grow distorted in an ugly grin.
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>And, lest the supplicating brute might reach
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>The ears of Jove, she was depriv'd of speech:
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>Her surly voice thro' a hoarse passage came
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>In savage sounds: her mind was still the same,
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>The furry monster fix'd her eyes above,
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>And heav'd her new unwieldy paws to Jove,
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>And beg'd his aid with inward groans; and tho'
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>She could not call him false, she thought him so.
<A NAME="634"></A><BR><BR>How did she fear to lodge in woods alone,
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>And haunt the fields and meadows, once her own!
<A NAME="636"></A><BR>How often wou'd the deep-mouth'd dogs pursue,
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>Whilst from her hounds the frighted huntress flew!
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>How did she fear her fellow-brutes, and shun
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>The shaggy bear, tho' now her self was one!
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>How from the sight of rugged wolves retire,
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>Although the grim Lycaon was her sire!
<A NAME="642"></A><BR><BR>But now her son had fifteen summers told,
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>Fierce at the chase, and in the forest bold;
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>When, as he beat the woods in quest of prey,
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>He chanc'd to rouze his mother where she lay.
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>She knew her son, and kept him in her sight,
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>And fondly gaz'd: the boy was in a fright,
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>And aim'd a pointed arrow at her breast,
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>And would have slain his mother in the beast;
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>But Jove forbad, and snatch'd 'em through the air
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>In whirlwinds up to Heav'n, and fix'd 'em there!
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>Where the new constellations nightly rise,
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>And add a lustre to the northern skies.
<A NAME="654"></A><BR><BR>When Juno saw the rival in her height,
<A NAME="655"></A><BR>Spangled with stars, and circled round with light,
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>She sought old Ocean in his deep abodes,
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>And Tethys, both rever'd among the Gods.
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>They ask what brings her there: "Ne'er ask," says 
<A NAME="659"></A>she,
<A NAME="660"></A><BR>"What brings me here, Heav'n is no place for me.
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>You'll see, when night has cover'd all things o'er,
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>Jove's starry bastard and triumphant whore
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>Usurp the Heav'ns; you'll see 'em proudly rowle
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>And who shall now on Juno's altars wait,
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>When those she hates grow greater by her hate?
<A NAME="666"></A><BR>I on the nymph a brutal form impress'd,
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>Jove to a goddess has transform'd the beast;
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>This, this was all my weak revenge could do:
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>But let the God his chaste amours pursue,
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>And, as he acted after Io's rape,
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>Restore th' adultress to her former shape;
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>Then may he cast his Juno off, and lead
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>The great Lycaon's offspring to his bed.
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>But you, ye venerable Pow'rs, be kind,
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>And, if my wrongs a due resentment find,
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>Receive not in your waves their setting beams,
<A NAME="677"></A><BR>Nor let the glaring strumpet taint your streams."
<A NAME="678"></A><BR><BR>The Goddess ended, and her wish was giv'n.
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>Back she return'd in triumph up to Heav'n;
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>Her gawdy peacocks drew her through the skies.
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>Their tails were spotted with a thousand eyes;
<A NAME="682"></A><BR>The eyes of Argus on their tails were rang'd,
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>At the same time the raven's colour chang'd.
<A NAME="684"></A><BR><BR><B>The Story of Coronis, and Birth of Aesculapius</B>
<A NAME="685"></A><BR><BR>The raven once in snowy plumes was drest,
<A NAME="686"></A><BR>White as the whitest dove's unsully'd breast,
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>Fair as the guardian of the Capitol,
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>Soft as the swan; a large and lovely fowl;
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>His tongue, his prating tongue had chang'd him quite
<A NAME="690"></A><BR>To sooty blackness, from the purest white.
<A NAME="691"></A><BR><BR>The story of his change shall here be told;
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>In Thessaly there liv'd a nymph of old,
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>Coronis nam'd; a peerless maid she shin'd,
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>Confest the fairest of the fairer kind.
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>Apollo lov'd her, 'till her guilt he knew,
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>While true she was, or whilst he thought her true.
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>But his own bird the raven chanc'd to find
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>The false one with a secret rival joyn'd.
<A NAME="699"></A><BR>Coronis begg'd him to suppress the tale,
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>But could not with repeated pray'rs prevail.
<A NAME="701"></A><BR>His milk-white pinions to the God he ply'd;
<A NAME="702"></A><BR>The busy daw flew with him, side by side,
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>And by a thousand teizing questions drew
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>Th' important secret from him as they flew.
<A NAME="705"></A><BR>The daw gave honest counsel, tho' despis'd,
<A NAME="706"></A><BR>And, tedious in her tattle, thus advis'd:
<A NAME="707"></A><BR>"Stay, silly bird, th' ill-natur'd task refuse,
<A NAME="708"></A><BR>Nor be the bearer of unwelcome news.
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>Be warn'd by my example: you discern
<A NAME="710"></A><BR>What now I am, and what I was shall learn.
<A NAME="711"></A><BR>My foolish honesty was all my crime;
<A NAME="712"></A><BR>Then hear my story. Once upon a time,
<A NAME="713"></A><BR>The two-shap'd Ericthonius had his birth
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>(Without a mother) from the teeming Earth;
<A NAME="715"></A><BR>Minerva nurs'd him, and the infant laid
<A NAME="716"></A><BR>Within a chest, of twining osiers made.
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>The daughters of king Cecrops undertook
<A NAME="718"></A><BR>To guard the chest, commanded not to look
<A NAME="719"></A><BR>On what was hid within. I stood to see
<A NAME="720"></A><BR>The charge obey'd, perch'd on a neighb'ring tree.
<A NAME="721"></A><BR>The sisters Pandrosos and Herse keep
<A NAME="722"></A><BR>The strict command; Aglauros needs would peep,
<A NAME="723"></A><BR>And saw the monstrous infant, in a fright,
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>And call'd her sisters to the hideous sight:
<A NAME="725"></A><BR>A boy's soft shape did to the waste prevail,
<A NAME="726"></A><BR>But the boy ended in a dragon's tail.
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>I told the stern Minerva all that pass'd;
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>But for my pains, discarded and disgrac'd,
<A NAME="729"></A><BR>The frowning Goddess drove me from her sight,
<A NAME="730"></A><BR>And for her fav'rite chose the bird of night.
<A NAME="731"></A><BR>Be then no tell-tale; for I think my wrong
<A NAME="732"></A><BR>Enough to teach a bird to hold her tongue.
<A NAME="733"></A><BR><BR>But you, perhaps, may think I was remov'd,
<A NAME="734"></A><BR>As never by the heav'nly maid belov'd:
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>But I was lov'd; ask Pallas if I lye;
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>Tho' Pallas hate me now, she won't deny:
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>For I, whom in a feather'd shape you view,
<A NAME="738"></A><BR>Was once a maid (by Heav'n the story's true)
<A NAME="739"></A><BR>A blooming maid, and a king's daughter too.
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>A crowd of lovers own'd my beauty's charms;
<A NAME="741"></A><BR>My beauty was the cause of all my harms;
<A NAME="742"></A><BR>Neptune, as on his shores I wont to rove,
<A NAME="743"></A><BR>Observ'd me in my walks, and fell in love.
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>He made his courtship, he confess'd his pain,
<A NAME="745"></A><BR>And offer'd force, when all his arts were vain;
<A NAME="746"></A><BR>Swift he pursu'd: I ran along the strand,
<A NAME="747"></A><BR>'Till, spent and weary'd on the sinking sand,
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>I shriek'd aloud, with cries I fill'd the air
<A NAME="749"></A><BR>To Gods and men; nor God nor man was there:
<A NAME="750"></A><BR>A virgin Goddess heard a virgin's pray'r.
<A NAME="751"></A><BR>For, as my arms I lifted to the skies,
<A NAME="752"></A><BR>I saw black feathers from my fingers rise;
<A NAME="753"></A><BR>I strove to fling my garment on the ground;
<A NAME="754"></A><BR>My garment turn'd to plumes, and girt me round:
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>My hands to beat my naked bosom try;
<A NAME="756"></A><BR>Nor naked bosom now nor hands had I:
<A NAME="757"></A><BR>Lightly I tript, nor weary as before
<A NAME="758"></A><BR>Sunk in the sand, but skim'd along the shore;
<A NAME="759"></A><BR>'Till, rising on my wings, I was preferr'd
<A NAME="760"></A><BR>To be the chaste Minerva's virgin bird:
<A NAME="761"></A><BR>Preferr'd in vain! I am now in disgrace:
<A NAME="762"></A><BR>Nyctimene the owl enjoys my place.
<A NAME="763"></A><BR><BR>On her incestuous life I need not dwell
<A NAME="764"></A><BR>(In Lesbos still the horrid tale they tell),
<A NAME="765"></A><BR>And of her dire amours you must have heard,
<A NAME="766"></A><BR>For which she now does penance in a bird,
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>That conscious of her shame, avoids the light,
<A NAME="768"></A><BR>And loves the gloomy cov'ring of the night;
<A NAME="769"></A><BR>The birds, where-e'er she flutters, scare away
<A NAME="770"></A><BR>The hooting wretch, and drive her from the day."
<A NAME="771"></A><BR><BR>The raven, urg'd by such impertinence,
<A NAME="772"></A><BR>Grew passionate, it seems, and took offence,
<A NAME="773"></A><BR>And curst the harmless daw; the daw withdrew:
<A NAME="774"></A><BR>The raven to her injur'd patron flew,
<A NAME="775"></A><BR>And found him out, and told the fatal truth
<A NAME="776"></A><BR>Of false Coronis and the favour'd youth.
<A NAME="777"></A><BR><BR>The God was wroth, the colour left his look,
<A NAME="778"></A><BR>The wreath his head, the harp his hand forsook:
<A NAME="779"></A><BR>His silver bow and feather'd shafts he took,
<A NAME="780"></A><BR>And lodg'd an arrow in the tender breast,
<A NAME="781"></A><BR>That had so often to his own been prest.
<A NAME="782"></A><BR>Down fell the wounded nymph, and sadly groan'd,
<A NAME="783"></A><BR>And pull'd his arrow reeking from the wound;
<A NAME="784"></A><BR>And weltring in her blood, thus faintly cry'd,
<A NAME="785"></A><BR>"Ah cruel God! tho' I have justly dy'd,
<A NAME="786"></A><BR>What has, alas! my unborn infant done,
<A NAME="787"></A><BR>That he should fall, and two expire in one?"
<A NAME="788"></A><BR>This said, in agonies she fetch'd her breath.
<A NAME="789"></A><BR><BR>The God dissolves in pity at her death;
<A NAME="790"></A><BR>He hates the bird that made her falshood known,
<A NAME="791"></A><BR>And hates himself for what himself had done;
<A NAME="792"></A><BR>The feather'd shaft, that sent her to the Fates,
<A NAME="793"></A><BR>And his own hand, that sent the shaft, he hates.
<A NAME="794"></A><BR>Fain would he heal the wound, and ease her pain,
<A NAME="795"></A><BR>And tries the compass of his art in vain.
<A NAME="796"></A><BR>Soon as he saw the lovely nymph expire,
<A NAME="797"></A><BR>The pile made ready, and the kindling fire.
<A NAME="798"></A><BR>With sighs and groans her obsequies he kept,
<A NAME="799"></A><BR>And, if a God could weep, the God had wept.
<A NAME="800"></A><BR>Her corps he kiss'd, and heav'nly incense brought,
<A NAME="801"></A><BR>And solemniz'd the death himself had wrought.
<A NAME="802"></A><BR><BR>But lest his offspring should her fate partake,
<A NAME="803"></A><BR>Spight of th' immortal mixture in his make,
<A NAME="804"></A><BR>He ript her womb, and set the child at large,
<A NAME="805"></A><BR>And gave him to the centaur Chiron's charge:
<A NAME="806"></A><BR>Then in his fury black'd the raven o'er,
<A NAME="807"></A><BR>And bid him prate in his white plumes no more.
<A NAME="808"></A><BR><BR><B>Ocyrrhoe transform'd into a Mare</B>
<A NAME="809"></A><BR><BR>Old Chiron took the babe with secret joy,
<A NAME="810"></A><BR>Proud of the charge of the celestial boy.
<A NAME="811"></A><BR>His daughter too, whom on the sandy shore
<A NAME="812"></A><BR>The nymph Charicle to the centaur bore,
<A NAME="813"></A><BR>With hair dishevel'd on her shoulders, came
<A NAME="814"></A><BR>To see the child, Ocyrrhoe was her name;
<A NAME="815"></A><BR>She knew her father's arts, and could rehearse
<A NAME="816"></A><BR>The depths of prophecy in sounding verse.
<A NAME="817"></A><BR>Once, as the sacred infant she survey'd,
<A NAME="818"></A><BR>The God was kindled in the raving maid,
<A NAME="819"></A><BR>And thus she utter'd her prophetick tale:
<A NAME="820"></A><BR>"Hail, great physician of the world, all-hail;
<A NAME="821"></A><BR>Hail, mighty infant, who in years to come
<A NAME="822"></A><BR>Shalt heal the nations, and defraud the tomb;
<A NAME="823"></A><BR>Swift be thy growth! thy triumphs unconfin'd!
<A NAME="824"></A><BR>Make kingdoms thicker, and increase mankind.
<A NAME="825"></A><BR>Thy daring art shall animate the dead,
<A NAME="826"></A><BR>And draw the thunder on thy guilty head:
<A NAME="827"></A><BR>Then shalt thou dye, but from the dark abode
<A NAME="828"></A><BR>Rise up victorious, and be twice a God.
<A NAME="829"></A><BR>And thou, my sire, not destin'd by thy birth
<A NAME="830"></A><BR>To turn to dust, and mix with common earth,
<A NAME="831"></A><BR>How wilt thou toss, and rave, and long to dye,
<A NAME="832"></A><BR>And quit thy claim to immortality;
<A NAME="833"></A><BR>When thou shalt feel, enrag'd with inward pains,
<A NAME="834"></A><BR>The Hydra's venom rankling in thy veins?
<A NAME="835"></A><BR>The Gods, in pity, shall contract thy date,
<A NAME="836"></A><BR>And give thee over to the pow'r of Fate."
<A NAME="837"></A><BR><BR>Thus entring into destiny, the maid
<A NAME="838"></A><BR>The secrets of offended Jove betray'd:
<A NAME="839"></A><BR>More had she still to say; but now appears
<A NAME="840"></A><BR>Oppress'd with sobs and sighs, and drown'd in tears.
<A NAME="841"></A><BR>"My voice," says she, "is gone, my language fails;
<A NAME="842"></A><BR>Through ev'ry limb my kindred shape prevails:
<A NAME="843"></A><BR>Why did the God this fatal gift impart,
<A NAME="844"></A><BR>And with prophetick raptures swell my heart!
<A NAME="845"></A><BR>What new desires are these? I long to pace
<A NAME="846"></A><BR>O'er flow'ry meadows, and to feed on grass;
<A NAME="847"></A><BR>I hasten to a brute, a maid no more;
<A NAME="848"></A><BR>But why, alas! am I transform'd all o'er?
<A NAME="849"></A><BR>My sire does half a human shape retain,
<A NAME="850"></A><BR>And in his upper parts preserve the man."
<A NAME="851"></A><BR><BR>Her tongue no more distinct complaints affords,
<A NAME="852"></A><BR>But in shrill accents and mis-shapen words
<A NAME="853"></A><BR>Pours forth such hideous wailings, as declare
<A NAME="854"></A><BR>The human form confounded in the mare:
<A NAME="855"></A><BR>'Till by degrees accomplish'd in the beast,
<A NAME="856"></A><BR>She neigh'd outright, and all the steed exprest.
<A NAME="857"></A><BR>Her stooping body on her hands is born,
<A NAME="858"></A><BR>Her hands are turn'd to hoofs, and shod in horn,
<A NAME="859"></A><BR>Her yellow tresses ruffle in a mane,
<A NAME="860"></A><BR>And in a flowing tail she frisks her train,
<A NAME="861"></A><BR>The mare was finish'd in her voice and look,
<A NAME="862"></A><BR>And a new name from the new figure took.
<A NAME="863"></A><BR><BR><B>The Transformation of Battus to a Touch stone</B>
<A NAME="864"></A><BR><BR>Sore wept the centuar, and to Phoebus pray'd;
<A NAME="865"></A><BR>But how could Phoebus give the centaur aid?
<A NAME="866"></A><BR>Degraded of his pow'r by angry Jove,
<A NAME="867"></A><BR>In Elis then a herd of beeves he drove;
<A NAME="868"></A><BR>And wielded in his hand a staff of oak,
<A NAME="869"></A><BR>And o'er his shoulders threw the shepherd's cloak;
<A NAME="870"></A><BR>On sev'n compacted reeds he us'd to play,
<A NAME="871"></A><BR>And on his rural pipe to waste the day.
<A NAME="872"></A><BR><BR>As once attentive to his pipe he play'd,
<A NAME="873"></A><BR>The crafty Hermes from the God convey'd
<A NAME="874"></A><BR>A drove, that sep'rate from their fellows stray'd.
<A NAME="875"></A><BR>The theft an old insidious peasant view'd
<A NAME="876"></A><BR>(They call'd him Battus in the neighbourhood),
<A NAME="877"></A><BR>Hir'd by a vealthy Pylian prince to feed
<A NAME="878"></A><BR>His fav'rite mares, and watch the gen'rous breed.
<A NAME="879"></A><BR>The thievish God suspected him, and took
<A NAME="880"></A><BR>The hind aside, and thus in whispers spoke:
<A NAME="881"></A><BR>"Discover not the theft, whoe'er thou be,
<A NAME="882"></A><BR>And take that milk-white heifer for thy fee."
<A NAME="883"></A><BR>"Go, stranger," cries the clown, "securely on,
<A NAME="884"></A><BR>That stone shall sooner tell," and show'd a stone.
<A NAME="885"></A><BR><BR>The God withdrew, but strait return'd again,
<A NAME="886"></A><BR>In speech and habit like a country swain;
<A NAME="887"></A><BR>And cries out, "Neighbour, hast thou seen a stray
<A NAME="888"></A><BR>Of bullocks and of heifers pass this way?
<A NAME="889"></A><BR>In the recov'ry of my cattle join,
<A NAME="890"></A><BR>A bullock and a heifer shall be thine."
<A NAME="891"></A><BR>The peasant quick replies, "You'll find 'em there
<A NAME="892"></A><BR>In yon dark vale"; and in the vale they were.
<A NAME="893"></A><BR>The double bribe had his false heart beguil'd:
<A NAME="894"></A><BR>The God, successful in the tryal, smil'd;
<A NAME="895"></A><BR>"And dost thou thus betray my self to me?
<A NAME="896"></A><BR>Me to my self dost thou betray?" says he:
<A NAME="897"></A><BR>Then to a Touch stone turns the faithless spy;
<A NAME="898"></A><BR>And in his name records his infamy.
<A NAME="899"></A><BR><BR><B>The Story of Aglauros, transform'd into a 
<A NAME="900"></A>Statue</B>
<A NAME="901"></A><BR><BR>This done, the God flew up on high, and pass'd
<A NAME="902"></A><BR>O'er lofty Athens, by Minerva grac'd,
<A NAME="903"></A><BR>And wide Munichia, whilst his eyes survey
<A NAME="904"></A><BR>All the vast region that beneath him lay.
<A NAME="905"></A><BR><BR>'Twas now the feast, when each Athenian maid
<A NAME="906"></A><BR>Her yearly homage to Minerva paid;
<A NAME="907"></A><BR>In canisters, with garlands cover'd o'er,
<A NAME="908"></A><BR>High on their heads, their mystick gifts they bore:
<A NAME="909"></A><BR>And now, returning in a solemn train,
<A NAME="910"></A><BR>The troop of shining virgins fill'd the plain.
<A NAME="911"></A><BR><BR>The God well pleas'd beheld the pompous show,
<A NAME="912"></A><BR>And saw the bright procession pass below;
<A NAME="913"></A><BR>Then veer'd about, and took a wheeling flight,
<A NAME="914"></A><BR>And hover'd o'er them: as the spreading kite,
<A NAME="915"></A><BR>That smells the slaughter'd victim from on high,
<A NAME="916"></A><BR>Flies at a distance, if the priests are nigh,
<A NAME="917"></A><BR>And sails around, and keeps it in her eye:
<A NAME="918"></A><BR>So kept the God the virgin quire in view,
<A NAME="919"></A><BR>And in slow winding circles round them flew.
<A NAME="920"></A><BR><BR>As Lucifer excells the meanest star,
<A NAME="921"></A><BR>Or, as the full-orb'd Phoebe, Lucifer;
<A NAME="922"></A><BR>So much did Herse all the rest outvy,
<A NAME="923"></A><BR>And gave a grace to the solemnity.
<A NAME="924"></A><BR>Hermes was fir'd, as in the clouds he hung:
<A NAME="925"></A><BR>So the cold bullet, that with fury slung
<A NAME="926"></A><BR>From Balearick engines mounts on high,
<A NAME="927"></A><BR>Glows in the whirl, and burns along the sky.
<A NAME="928"></A><BR>At length he pitch'd upon the ground, and show'd
<A NAME="929"></A><BR>The form divine, the features of a God.
<A NAME="930"></A><BR>He knew their vertue o'er a female heart,
<A NAME="931"></A><BR>And yet he strives to better them by art.
<A NAME="932"></A><BR>He hangs his mantle loose, and sets to show
<A NAME="933"></A><BR>The golden edging on the seam below;
<A NAME="934"></A><BR>Adjusts his flowing curls, and in his hand
<A NAME="935"></A><BR>Waves, with an air, the sleep-procuring wand;
<A NAME="936"></A><BR>The glitt'ring sandals to his feet applies,
<A NAME="937"></A><BR>And to each heel the well-trim'd pinion ties.
<A NAME="938"></A><BR><BR>His ornaments with nicest art display'd,
<A NAME="939"></A><BR>He seeks th' apartment of the royal maid.
<A NAME="940"></A><BR>The roof was all with polish'd iv'ry lin'd,
<A NAME="941"></A><BR>That richly mix'd, in clouds of tortoise shin'd.
<A NAME="942"></A><BR>Three rooms, contiguous, in a range were plac'd,
<A NAME="943"></A><BR>The midmost by the beauteous Herse grac'd;
<A NAME="944"></A><BR>Her virgin sisters lodg'd on either side.
<A NAME="945"></A><BR>Aglauros first th' approaching God descry'd,
<A NAME="946"></A><BR>And, as he cross'd her chamber, ask'd his name,
<A NAME="947"></A><BR>And what his business was, and whence he came.
<A NAME="948"></A><BR>"I come," reply'd the God, "from Heav'n, to woo
<A NAME="949"></A><BR>Your sister, and to make an aunt of you;
<A NAME="950"></A><BR>I am the son and messenger of Jove;
<A NAME="951"></A><BR>My name is Mercury, my bus'ness love;
<A NAME="952"></A><BR>Do you, kind damsel, take a lover's part,
<A NAME="953"></A><BR>And gain admittance to your sister's heart."
<A NAME="954"></A><BR><BR>She star'd him in the face with looks amaz'd,
<A NAME="955"></A><BR>As when she on Minerva's secret gaz'd,
<A NAME="956"></A><BR>And asks a mighty treasure for her hire;
<A NAME="957"></A><BR>And, 'till he brings it, makes the God retire.
<A NAME="958"></A><BR>Minerva griev'd to see the nymph succeed;
<A NAME="959"></A><BR>And now remembring the late impious deed,
<A NAME="960"></A><BR>When, disobedient to her strict command,
<A NAME="961"></A><BR>She touch'd the chest with an unhallow'd hand;
<A NAME="962"></A><BR>In big-swoln sighs her inward rage express'd,
<A NAME="963"></A><BR>That heav'd the rising Aegis on her breast;
<A NAME="964"></A><BR>Then sought out Envy in her dark abode,
<A NAME="965"></A><BR>Defil'd with ropy gore and clots of blood:
<A NAME="966"></A><BR>Shut from the winds, and from the wholesome skies,
<A NAME="967"></A><BR>In a deep vale the gloomy dungeon lies,
<A NAME="968"></A><BR>Dismal and cold, where not a beam of light
<A NAME="969"></A><BR>Invades the winter, or disturbs the night.
<A NAME="970"></A><BR><BR>Directly to the cave her course she steer'd;
<A NAME="971"></A><BR>Against the gates her martial lance she rear'd;
<A NAME="972"></A><BR>The gates flew open, and the fiend appear'd.
<A NAME="973"></A><BR>A pois'nous morsel in her teeth she chew'd,
<A NAME="974"></A><BR>And gorg'd the flesh of vipers for her food.
<A NAME="975"></A><BR>Minerva loathing turn'd away her eye;
<A NAME="976"></A><BR>The hideous monster, rising heavily,
<A NAME="977"></A><BR>Came stalking forward with a sullen pace,
<A NAME="978"></A><BR>And left her mangled offals on the place.
<A NAME="979"></A><BR>Soon as she saw the goddess gay and bright,
<A NAME="980"></A><BR>She fetch'd a groan at such a chearful sight.
<A NAME="981"></A><BR>Livid and meagre were her looks, her eye
<A NAME="982"></A><BR>In foul distorted glances turn'd awry;
<A NAME="983"></A><BR>A hoard of gall her inward parts possess'd,
<A NAME="984"></A><BR>And spread a greenness o'er her canker'd breast;
<A NAME="985"></A><BR>Her teeth were brown with rust, and from her tongue,
<A NAME="986"></A><BR>In dangling drops, the stringy poison hung.
<A NAME="987"></A><BR>She never smiles but when the wretched weep,
<A NAME="988"></A><BR>Nor lulls her malice with a moment's sleep,
<A NAME="989"></A><BR>Restless in spite: while watchful to destroy,
<A NAME="990"></A><BR>She pines and sickens at another's joy;
<A NAME="991"></A><BR>Foe to her self, distressing and distrest,
<A NAME="992"></A><BR>She bears her own tormentor in her breast.
<A NAME="993"></A><BR>The Goddess gave (for she abhorr'd her sight)
<A NAME="994"></A><BR>A short command: "To Athens speed thy flight;
<A NAME="995"></A><BR>On curst Aglauros try thy utmost art,
<A NAME="996"></A><BR>And fix thy rankest venoms in her heart."
<A NAME="997"></A><BR>This said, her spear she push'd against the ground,
<A NAME="998"></A><BR>And mounting from it with an active bound,
<A NAME="999"></A><BR>Flew off to Heav'n: the hag with eyes askew
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR>Look'd up, and mutter'd curses as she flew;
<A NAME="1001"></A><BR>For sore she fretted, and began to grieve
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR>At the success which she her self must give.
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR>Then takes her staff, hung round with wreaths of 
<A NAME="1004"></A>thorn,
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR>And sails along, in a black whirlwind born,
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR>O'er fields and flow'ry meadows: where she steers
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR>Her baneful course, a mighty blast appears,
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR>Mildews and blights; the meadows are defac'd,
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR>The fields, the flow'rs, and the whole years laid 
<A NAME="1010"></A>waste:
<A NAME="1011"></A><BR>On mortals next, and peopled towns she falls,
<A NAME="1012"></A><BR>And breathes a burning plague among their walls.
<A NAME="1013"></A><BR><BR>When Athens she beheld, for arts renown'd,
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR>With peace made happy, and with plenty crown'd,
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR>Scarce could the hideous fiend from tears forbear,
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR>To find out nothing that deserv'd a tear.
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR>Th' apartment now she enter'd, where at rest
<A NAME="1018"></A><BR>Aglauros lay, with gentle sleep opprest.
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR>To execute Minerva's dire command,
<A NAME="1020"></A><BR>She stroak'd the virgin with her canker'd hand,
<A NAME="1021"></A><BR>Then prickly thorns into her breast convey'd,
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR>That stung to madness the devoted maid:
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR>Her subtle venom still improves the smart,
<A NAME="1024"></A><BR>Frets in the blood, and festers in the heart.
<A NAME="1025"></A><BR><BR>To make the work more sure, a scene she drew,
<A NAME="1026"></A><BR>And plac'd before the dreaming virgin's view
<A NAME="1027"></A><BR>Her sister's marriage, and her glorious fate:
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR>Th' imaginary bride appears in state;
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR>The bride-groom with unwonted beauty glows:
<A NAME="1030"></A><BR>For envy magnifies what-e'er she shows.
<A NAME="1031"></A><BR><BR>Full of the dream, Aglauros pin'd away
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR>In tears all night, in darkness all the day;
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR>Consum'd like ice, that just begins to run,
<A NAME="1034"></A><BR>When feebly smitten by the distant sun;
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR>Or like unwholsome weeds, that set on fire
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR>Are slowly wasted, and in smoke expire.
<A NAME="1037"></A><BR>Giv'n up to envy (for in ev'ry thought
<A NAME="1038"></A><BR>The thorns, the venom, and the vision wrought)
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR>Oft did she call on death, as oft decreed,
<A NAME="1040"></A><BR>Rather than see her sister's wish succeed,
<A NAME="1041"></A><BR>To tell her awfull father what had past:
<A NAME="1042"></A><BR>At length before the door her self she cast;
<A NAME="1043"></A><BR>And, sitting on the ground with sullen pride,
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR>A passage to the love-sick God deny'd.
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR>The God caress'd, and for admission pray'd,
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR>And sooth'd in softest words th' envenom'd maid.
<A NAME="1047"></A><BR>In vain he sooth'd: "Begone!" the maid replies,
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR>"Or here I keep my seat, and never rise."
<A NAME="1049"></A><BR>"Then keep thy seat for ever," cries the God,
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR>And touch'd the door, wide op'ning to his rod.
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR>Fain would she rise, and stop him, but she found
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR>Her trunk too heavy to forsake the ground;
<A NAME="1053"></A><BR>Her joynts are all benum'd, her hands are pale,
<A NAME="1054"></A><BR>And marble now appears in ev'ry nail.
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR>As when a cancer in the body feeds,
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR>And gradual death from limb to limb proceeds;
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR>So does the chilness to each vital parte
<A NAME="1058"></A><BR>Spread by degrees, and creeps into her heart;
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR>'Till hard'ning ev'ry where, and speechless grown,
<A NAME="1060"></A><BR>She sits unmov'd, and freezes to a stone.
<A NAME="1061"></A><BR>But still her envious hue and sullen mien
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR>Are in the sedentary figure seen.
<A NAME="1063"></A><BR><BR><B>Europa's Rape</B>
<A NAME="1064"></A><BR><BR>When now the God his fury had allay'd,
<A NAME="1065"></A><BR>And taken vengeance of the stubborn maid,
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR>From where the bright Athenian turrets rise
<A NAME="1067"></A><BR>He mounts aloft, and re-ascends the skies.
<A NAME="1068"></A><BR>Jove saw him enter the sublime abodes,
<A NAME="1069"></A><BR>And, as he mix'd among the crowd of Gods,
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR>Beckon'd him out, and drew him from the rest,
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR>And in soft whispers thus his will exprest.
<A NAME="1072"></A><BR><BR>"My trusty Hermes, by whose ready aid
<A NAME="1073"></A><BR>Thy sire's commands are through the world convey'd.
<A NAME="1074"></A><BR>Resume thy wings, exert their utmost force,
<A NAME="1075"></A><BR>And to the walls of Sidon speed thy course;
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR>There find a herd of heifers wand'ring o'er
<A NAME="1077"></A><BR>The neighb'ring hill, and drive 'em to the shore."
<A NAME="1078"></A><BR><BR>Thus spoke the God, concealing his intent.
<A NAME="1079"></A><BR>The trusty Hermes, on his message went,
<A NAME="1080"></A><BR>And found the herd of heifers wand'ring o'er
<A NAME="1081"></A><BR>A neighb'ring hill, and drove 'em to the shore;
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR>Where the king's daughter, with a lovely train
<A NAME="1083"></A><BR>Of fellow-nymphs, was sporting on the plain.
<A NAME="1084"></A><BR><BR>The dignity of empire laid aside,
<A NAME="1085"></A><BR>(For love but ill agrees with kingly pride)
<A NAME="1086"></A><BR>The ruler of the skies, the thund'ring God,
<A NAME="1087"></A><BR>Who shakes the world's foundations with a nod,
<A NAME="1088"></A><BR>Among a herd of lowing heifers ran,
<A NAME="1089"></A><BR>Frisk'd in a bull, and bellow'd o'er the plain.
<A NAME="1090"></A><BR>Large rowles of fat about his shoulders clung,
<A NAME="1091"></A><BR>And from his neck the double dewlap hung.
<A NAME="1092"></A><BR>His skin was whiter than the snow that lies
<A NAME="1093"></A><BR>Unsully'd by the breath of southern skies;
<A NAME="1094"></A><BR>Small shining horns on his curl'd forehead stand,
<A NAME="1095"></A><BR>As turn'd and polish'd by the work-man's hand;
<A NAME="1096"></A><BR>His eye-balls rowl'd, not formidably bright,
<A NAME="1097"></A><BR>But gaz'd and languish'd with a gentle light.
<A NAME="1098"></A><BR>His ev'ry look was peaceful, and exprest
<A NAME="1099"></A><BR>The softness of the lover in the beast.
<A NAME="1100"></A><BR><BR>Agenor's royal daughter, as she plaid
<A NAME="1101"></A><BR>Among the fields, the milk-white bull survey'd,
<A NAME="1102"></A><BR>And view'd his spotless body with delight,
<A NAME="1103"></A><BR>And at a distance kept him in her sight.
<A NAME="1104"></A><BR>At length she pluck'd the rising flow'rs, and fed
<A NAME="1105"></A><BR>The gentle beast, and fondly stroak'd his head.
<A NAME="1106"></A><BR>He stood well-pleas'd to touch the charming fair,
<A NAME="1107"></A><BR>But hardly could confine his pleasure there.
<A NAME="1108"></A><BR>And now he wantons o'er the neighb'ring strand,
<A NAME="1109"></A><BR>Now rowls his body on the yellow sand;
<A NAME="1110"></A><BR>And, now perceiving all her fears decay'd,
<A NAME="1111"></A><BR>Comes tossing forward to the royal maid;
<A NAME="1112"></A><BR>Gives her his breast to stroke, and downward turns
<A NAME="1113"></A><BR>His grizly brow, and gently stoops his horns.
<A NAME="1114"></A><BR>In flow'ry wreaths the royal virgin drest
<A NAME="1115"></A><BR>His bending horns, and kindly clapt his breast.
<A NAME="1116"></A><BR>'Till now grown wanton and devoid of fear,
<A NAME="1117"></A><BR>Not knowing that she prest the Thunderer,
<A NAME="1118"></A><BR>She plac'd her self upon his back, and rode
<A NAME="1119"></A><BR>O'er fields and meadows, seated on the God.
<A NAME="1120"></A><BR><BR>He gently march'd along, and by degrees
<A NAME="1121"></A><BR>Left the dry meadow, and approach'd the seas;
<A NAME="1122"></A><BR>Where now he dips his hoofs and wets his thighs,
<A NAME="1123"></A><BR>Now plunges in, and carries off the prize.
<A NAME="1124"></A><BR>The frighted nymph looks backward on the shoar,
<A NAME="1125"></A><BR>And hears the tumbling billows round her roar;
<A NAME="1126"></A><BR>But still she holds him fast: one hand is born
<A NAME="1127"></A><BR>Upon his back; the other grasps a horn:
<A NAME="1128"></A><BR>Her train of ruffling garments flies behind,
<A NAME="1129"></A><BR>Swells in the air, and hovers in the wind.
<A NAME="1130"></A><BR><BR>Through storms and tempests he the virgin bore,
<A NAME="1131"></A><BR>And lands her safe on the Dictean shore;
<A NAME="1132"></A><BR>Where now, in his divinest form array'd,
<A NAME="1133"></A><BR>In his true shape he captivates the maid;
<A NAME="1134"></A><BR>Who gazes on him, and with wond'ring eyes
<A NAME="1135"></A><BR>Beholds the new majestick figure rise,
<A NAME="1136"></A><BR>His glowing features, and celestial light,
<A NAME="1137"></A><BR>And all the God discover'd to her sight.
