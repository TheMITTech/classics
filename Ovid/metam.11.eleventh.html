<A NAME="10"></A><B>The Death of Orpheus</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>Here, while the Thracian bard's enchanting strain
<A NAME="12"></A><BR>Sooths beasts, and woods, and all the listn'ing 
<A NAME="13"></A>plain,
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>The female Bacchanals, devoutly mad,
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>In shaggy skins, like savage creatures, clad,
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>Warbling in air perceiv'd his lovely lay,
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>And from a rising ground beheld him play.
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>When one, the wildest, with dishevel'd hair,
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>That loosely stream'd, and ruffled in the air;
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>Soon as her frantick eye the lyrist spy'd,
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>See, see! the hater of our sex, she cry'd.
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>Then at his face her missive javelin sent,
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>Which whiz'd along, and brusht him as it went;
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>But the soft wreathes of ivy twisted round,
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>Prevent a deep impression of the wound.
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>Another, for a weapon, hurls a stone,
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>Which, by the sound subdu'd as soon as thrown,
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>Falls at his feet, and with a seeming sense
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>Implores his pardon for its late offence.
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>But now their frantick rage unbounded grows,
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>Turns all to madness, and no measure knows:
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>Yet this the charms of musick might subdue,
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>But that, with all its charms, is conquer'd too;
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>In louder strains their hideous yellings rise,
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>And squeaking horn-pipes eccho thro' the skies,
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>Which, in hoarse consort with the drum, confound
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>The moving lyre, and ev'ry gentle sound:
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>Then 'twas the deafen'd stones flew on with speed,
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>And saw, unsooth'd, their tuneful poet bleed.
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>The birds, the beasts, and all the savage crew
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>Which the sweet lyrist to attention drew,
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>Now, by the female mob's more furious rage,
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>Are driv'n, and forc'd to quit the shady stage.
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>Next their fierce hands the bard himself assail,
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>Nor can his song against their wrath prevail:
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>They flock, like birds, when in a clustring flight,
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>By day they chase the boding fowl of night.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>So crowded amphitheatres survey
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>The stag, to greedy dogs a future prey.
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>Their steely javelins, which soft curls entwine
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>Of budding tendrils from the leafy vine,
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>For sacred rites of mild religion made,
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>Are flung promiscuous at the poet's head.
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>Those clods of earth or flints discharge, and these
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>Hurl prickly branches sliver'd from the trees.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>And, lest their passion shou'd be unsupply'd,
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>The rabble crew, by chance, at distance spy'd
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>Where oxen, straining at the heavy yoke,
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>The fallow'd field with slow advances broke;
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>Nigh which the brawny peasants dug the soil,
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>Procuring food with long laborious toil.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>These, when they saw the ranting throng draw near,
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>Quitted their tools, and fled, possest with fear.
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>Long spades, and rakes of mighty size were found,
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>Carelesly left upon the broken ground.
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>With these the furious lunaticks engage,
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>And first the lab'ring oxen feel their rage;
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>Then to the poet they return with speed,
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>Whose fate was, past prevention, now decreed:
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>In vain he lifts his suppliant hands, in vain
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>He tries, before, his never-failing strain.
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>And, from those sacred lips, whose thrilling sound
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>Fierce tygers, and insensate rocks cou'd wound,
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>Ah Gods! how moving was the mournful sight!
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>To see the fleeting soul now take its flight.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>Thee the soft warblers of the feather'd kind
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>Bewail'd; for thee thy savage audience pin'd;
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>Those rocks and woods that oft thy strain had led,
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>Mourn for their charmer, and lament him dead;
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>And drooping trees their leafy glories shed.
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>Naids and Dryads with dishevel'd hair
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>Promiscuous weep, and scarfs of sable wear;
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>Nor cou'd the river-Gods conceal their moan,
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>But with new floods of tears augment their own.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>His mangled limbs lay scatter'd all around,
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>His head, and harp a better fortune found;
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>In Hebrus' streams they gently roul'd along,
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>And sooth'd the waters with a mournful song.
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>Soft deadly notes the lifeless tongue inspire,
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>A doleful tune sounds from the floating lyre;
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>The hollows banks in solemn consort mourn,
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>And the sad strain in ecchoing groans return.
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>Now with the current to the sea they glide,
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>Born by the billows of the briny tide;
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>And driv'n where waves round rocky Lesbos roar,
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>They strand, and lodge upon Methymna's shore.
<A NAME="97"></A><BR><BR>But here, when landed on the foreign soil,
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>A venom'd snake, the product of the isle
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>Attempts the head, and sacred locks embru'd
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>With clotted gore, and still fresh-dropping blood.
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>Phoebus, at last, his kind protection gives,
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>And from the fact the greedy monster drives:
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>Whose marbled jaws his impious crime atone,
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>Still grinning ghastly, tho' transform'd to stone.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR>His ghost flies downward to the Stygian shore,
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>And knows the places it had seen before:
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>Among the shadows of the pious train
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>He finds Eurydice, and loves again;
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>With pleasure views the beauteous phantom's charms,
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>And clasps her in his unsubstantial arms.
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>There side by side they unmolested walk,
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>Or pass their blissful hours in pleasing talk;
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>Aft or before the bard securely goes,
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>And, without danger, can review his spouse.
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR><B>The Thracian Women transform'd to Trees</B>
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR>Bacchus, resolving to revenge the wrong,
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>Of Orpheus murder'd, on the madding throng,
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>Decreed that each accomplice dame should stand
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>Fix'd by the roots along the conscious land.
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>Their wicked feet, that late so nimbly ran
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>To wreak their malice on the guiltless man,
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>Sudden with twisted ligatures were bound,
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>Like trees, deep planted in the turfy ground.
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>And, as the fowler with his subtle gins,
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>His feather'd captives by the feet entwines,
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>That flutt'ring pant, and struggle to get loose,
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>Yet only closer draw the fatal noose;
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>So these were caught; and, as they strove in vain
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>To quit the place, they but encreas'd their pain.
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>They flounce and toil, yet find themselves controul'd;
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>The root, tho' pliant, toughly keeps its hold.
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>In vain their toes and feet they look to find,
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>For ev'n their shapely legs are cloath'd with rind.
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>One smites her thighs with a lamenting stroke,
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>And finds the flesh transform'd to solid oak;
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>Another, with surprize, and grief distrest,
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>Lays on above, but beats a wooden breast.
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>A rugged bark their softer neck invades,
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>Their branching arms shoot up delightful shades;
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>At once they seem, and are, a real grove,
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>With mossy trunks below, and verdant leaves above.
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR><B>The Fable of Midas</B>
<A NAME="143"></A><BR><BR>Nor this suffic'd; the God's disgust remains,
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>And he resolves to quit their hated plains;
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>The vineyards of Tymole ingross his care,
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>And, with a better choir, he fixes there;
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>Where the smooth streams of clear Pactolus roll'd,
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>Then undistinguish'd for its sands of gold.
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>The satyrs with the nymphs, his usual throng,
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>Come to salute their God, and jovial danc'd along.
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>Silenus only miss'd; for while he reel'd,
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>Feeble with age, and wine, about the field,
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>The hoary drunkard had forgot his way,
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>And to the Phrygian clowns became a prey;
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>Who to king Midas drag the captive God,
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>While on his totty pate the wreaths of ivy nod.
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR>Midas from Orpheus had been taught his lore,
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>And knew the rites of Bacchus long before.
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>He, when he saw his venerable guest,
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>In honour of the God ordain'd a feast.
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>Ten days in course, with each continu'd night,
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>Were spent in genial mirth, and brisk delight:
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>Then on th' eleventh, when with brighter ray
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>Phosphor had chac'd the fading stars away,
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>The king thro' Lydia's fields young Bacchus sought,
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>And to the God his foster-father brought.
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>Pleas'd with the welcome sight, he bids him soon
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>But name his wish, and swears to grant the boon.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>A glorious offer! yet but ill bestow'd
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>On him whose choice so little judgment show'd.
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>Give me, says he (nor thought he ask'd too much),
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>That with my body whatsoe'er I touch,
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>Chang'd from the nature which it held of old,
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>May be converted into yellow gold.
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>He had his wish; but yet the God repin'd,
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>To think the fool no better wish could find.
<A NAME="177"></A><BR><BR>But the brave king departed from the place,
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>With smiles of gladness sparkling in his face:
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>Nor could contain, but, as he took his way,
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>Impatient longs to make the first essay.
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>Down from a lowly branch a twig he drew,
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>The twig strait glitter'd with a golden hue:
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>He takes a stone, the stone was turn'd to gold;
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>A clod he touches, and the crumbling mold
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>Acknowledg'd soon the great transforming pow'r,
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>In weight and substance like a mass of ore.
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>He pluck'd the corn, and strait his grasp appears
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>Fill'd with a bending tuft of golden ears.
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>An apple next he takes, and seems to hold
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>The bright Hesperian vegetable gold.
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>His hand he careless on a pillar lays.
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>With shining gold the fluted pillars blaze:
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>And while he washes, as the servants pour,
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>His touch converts the stream to Danae's show'r.
<A NAME="195"></A><BR><BR>To see these miracles so finely wrought,
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>Fires with transporting joy his giddy thought.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>The ready slaves prepare a sumptuous board,
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>Spread with rich dainties for their happy lord;
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>Whose pow'rful hands the bread no sooner hold,
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>But its whole substance is transform'd to gold:
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>Up to his mouth he lifts the sav'ry meat,
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>Which turns to gold as he attempts to eat:
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>His patron's noble juice of purple hue,
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>Touch'd by his lips, a gilded cordial grew;
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>Unfit for drink, and wondrous to behold,
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>It trickles from his jaws a fluid gold.
<A NAME="207"></A><BR><BR>The rich poor fool, confounded with surprize,
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>Starving in all his various plenty lies:
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>Sick of his wish, he now detests the pow'r,
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>For which he ask'd so earnestly before;
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>Amidst his gold with pinching famine curst;
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>And justly tortur'd with an equal thirst.
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>At last his shining arms to Heav'n he rears,
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>And in distress, for refuge, flies to pray'rs.
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>O father Bacchus, I have sinn'd, he cry'd,
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>And foolishly thy gracious gift apply'd;
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>Thy pity now, repenting, I implore;
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>Oh! may I feel the golden plague no more.
<A NAME="219"></A><BR><BR>The hungry wretch, his folly thus confest,
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>Touch'd the kind deity's good-natur'd breast;
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>The gentle God annull'd his first decree,
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>And from the cruel compact set him free.
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>But then, to cleanse him quite from further harm,
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>And to dilute the relicks of the charm,
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>He bids him seek the stream that cuts the land
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>Nigh where the tow'rs of Lydian Sardis stand;
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>Then trace the river to the fountain head,
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>And meet it rising from its rocky bed;
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>There, as the bubling tide pours forth amain,
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>To plunge his body in, and wash away the stain.
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>The king instructed to the fount retires,
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>But with the golden charm the stream inspires:
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>For while this quality the man forsakes,
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>An equal pow'r the limpid water takes;
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>Informs with veins of gold the neighb'ring land,
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>And glides along a bed of golden sand.
<A NAME="237"></A><BR><BR>Now loathing wealth, th' occasion of his woes,
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>Far in the woods he sought a calm repose;
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>In caves and grottos, where the nymphs resort,
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>And keep with mountain Pan their sylvan court.
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>Ah! had he left his stupid soul behind!
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>But his condition alter'd not his mind.
<A NAME="243"></A><BR><BR>For where high Tmolus rears his shady brow,
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>And from his cliffs surveys the seas below,
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>In his descent, by Sardis bounded here,
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>By the small confines of Hypaepa there,
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>Pan to the nymphs his frolick ditties play'd,
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>Tuning his reeds beneath the chequer'd shade.
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>The nymphs are pleas'd, the boasting sylvan plays,
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>And speaks with slight of great Apollo's lays.
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>Tmolus was arbiter; the boaster still
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>Accepts the tryal with unequal skill.
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>The venerable judge was seated high
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>On his own hill, that seem'd to touch the sky.
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>Above the whisp'ring trees his head he rears,
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>From their encumbring boughs to free his ears;
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>A wreath of oak alone his temples bound,
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>The pendant acorns loosely dangled round.
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>In me your judge, says he, there's no delay:
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>Then bids the goatherd God begin, and play.
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>Pan tun'd the pipe, and with his rural song
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>Pleas'd the low taste of all the vulgar throng;
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>Such songs a vulgar judgment mostly please,
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>Midas was there, and Midas judg'd with these.
<A NAME="265"></A><BR><BR>The mountain sire with grave deportment now
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>To Phoebus turns his venerable brow:
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>And, as he turns, with him the listning wood
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>In the same posture of attention stood.
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>The God his own Parnassian laurel crown'd,
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>And in a wreath his golden tresses bound,
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>Graceful his purple mantle swept the ground.
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>High on the left his iv'ry lute he rais'd,
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>The lute, emboss'd with glitt'ring jewels, blaz'd
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>In his right hand he nicely held the quill,
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>His easy posture spoke a master's skill.
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>The strings he touch'd with more than human art,
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>Which pleas'd the judge's ear, and sooth'd his heart;
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>Who soon judiciously the palm decreed,
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>And to the lute postpon'd the squeaking reed.
<A NAME="280"></A><BR><BR>All, with applause, the rightful sentence heard,
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>Midas alone dissatisfy'd appear'd;
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>To him unjustly giv'n the judgment seems,
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>For Pan's barbarick notes he most esteems.
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>The lyrick God, who thought his untun'd ear
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>Deserv'd but ill a human form to wear,
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>Of that deprives him, and supplies the place
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>With some more fit, and of an ampler space:
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>Fix'd on his noddle an unseemly pair,
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>Flagging, and large, and full of whitish hair;
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>Without a total change from what he was,
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>Still in the man preserves the simple ass.
<A NAME="292"></A><BR><BR>He, to conceal the scandal of the deed,
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>A purple turbant folds about his head;
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>Veils the reproach from publick view, and fears
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>The laughing world would spy his monstrous ears.
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>One trusty barber-slave, that us'd to dress
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>His master's hair, when lengthen'd to excess,
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>The mighty secret knew, but knew alone,
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>And, tho' impatient, durst not make it known.
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>Restless, at last, a private place he found,
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>Then dug a hole, and told it to the ground;
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>In a low whisper he reveal'd the case,
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>And cover'd in the earth, and silent left the place.
<A NAME="304"></A><BR><BR>In time, of trembling reeds a plenteous crop
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>From the confided furrow sprouted up;
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>Which, high advancing with the ripening year,
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>Made known the tiller, and his fruitless care:
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>For then the rustling blades, and whisp'ring wind,
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>To tell th' important secret, both combin'd.
<A NAME="310"></A><BR><BR><B>The Building of Troy</B>
<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR>Phoebus, with full revenge, from Tmolus flies,
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>Darts thro' the air, and cleaves the liquid skies;
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>Near Hellespont he lights, and treads the plains
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>Where great Laomedon sole monarch reigns;
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>Where, built between the two projecting strands,
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>To Panomphaean Jove an altar stands.
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>Here first aspiring thoughts the king employ,
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>To found the lofty tow'rs of future Troy.
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>The work, from schemes magnificent begun,
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>At vast expence was slowly carry'd on:
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>Which Phoebus seeing, with the trident God
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>Who rules the swelling surges with his nod,
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>Assuming each a mortal shape, combine
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>At a set price to finish his design.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>The work was built; the king their price denies,
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>And his injustice backs with perjuries.
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>This Neptune cou'd not brook, but drove the main,
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>A mighty deluge, o'er the Phrygian plain:
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>'Twas all a sea; the waters of the deep
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>From ev'ry vale the copious harvest sweep;
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>The briny billows overflow the soil,
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>Ravage the fields, and mock the plowman's toil.
<A NAME="333"></A><BR><BR>Nor this appeas'd the God's revengeful mind,
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>For still a greater plague remains behind;
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>A huge sea-monster lodges on the sands,
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>And the king's daughter for his prey demands.
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>To him that sav'd the damsel, was decreed
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>A set of horses of the Sun's fine breed:
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>But when Alcides from the rock unty'd
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>The trembling fair, the ransom was deny'd.
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>He, in revenge, the new-built walls attack'd,
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>And the twice-perjur'd city bravely sack'd.
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>Telamon aided, and in justice shar'd
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>Part of the plunder as his due reward:
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>The princess, rescu'd late, with all her charms,
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>Hesione, was yielded to his arms;
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>For Peleus, with a Goddess-bride, was more
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>Proud of his spouse, than of his birth before:
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>Grandsons to Jove there might be more than one,
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>But he the Goddess had enjoy'd alone.
<A NAME="351"></A><BR><BR><B>The Story of Thetis and Peleus</B>
<A NAME="352"></A><BR><BR>For Proteus thus to virgin Thetis said,
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>Fair Goddess of the waves, consent to wed,
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>And take some spritely lover to your bed.
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>A son you'll have, the terror of the field,
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>To whom in fame, and pow'r his sire shall yield.
<A NAME="357"></A><BR><BR>Jove, who ador'd the nymph with boundless love,
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>Did from his breast the dangerous flame remove.
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>He knew the Fates, nor car'd to raise up one,
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>Whose fame and greatness should eclipse his own,
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>On happy Peleus he bestow'd her charms,
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>And bless'd his grandson in the Goddess' arms:
<A NAME="363"></A><BR><BR>A silent creek Thessalia's coast can show;
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>Two arms project, and shape it like a bow;
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>'Twould make a bay, but the transparent tide
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>Does scarce the yellow-gravell'd bottom hide;
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>For the quick eye may thro' the liquid wave
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>A firm unweedy level beach perceive.
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>A grove of fragrant myrtle near it grows,
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>Whose boughs, tho' thick, a beauteous grot disclose;
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>The well-wrought fabrick, to discerning eyes,
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>Rather by art than Nature seems to rise.
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>A bridled dolphin oft fair Thetis bore
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>To this her lov'd retreat, her fav'rite shore.
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>Here Peleus seiz'd her, slumbring while she lay,
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>And urg'd his suit with all that love could say:
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>But when he found her obstinately coy,
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>Resolv'd to force her, and command the joy;
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>The nymph, o'erpowr'd, to art for succour flies
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>And various shapes the eager youth surprize:
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>A bird she seems, but plies her wings in vain,
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>His hands the fleeting substance still detain:
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>A branchy tree high in the air she grew;
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>About its bark his nimble arms he threw:
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>A tyger next she glares with flaming eyes;
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>The frighten'd lover quits his hold, and flies:
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>The sea-Gods he with sacred rites adores,
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>Then a libation on the ocean pours;
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>While the fat entrails crackle in the fire,
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>And sheets of smoak in sweet perfume aspire;
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>'Till Proteus rising from his oozy bed,
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>Thus to the poor desponding lover said:
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>No more in anxious thoughts your mind employ,
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>For yet you shall possess the dear expected joy.
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>You must once more th' unwary nymph surprize,
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>As in her cooly grot she slumbring lies;
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>Then bind her fast with unrelenting hands,
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>And strain her tender limbs with knotted bands.
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>Still hold her under ev'ry different shape,
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>'Till tir'd she tries no longer to escape.
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>Thus he: then sunk beneath the glassy flood,
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>And broken accents flutter'd, where he stood.
<A NAME="403"></A><BR><BR>Bright Sol had almost now his journey done,
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>And down the steepy western convex run;
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>When the fair Nereid left the briny wave,
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>And, as she us'd, retreated to her cave.
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>He scarce had bound her fast, when she arose,
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>And into various shapes her body throws:
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>She went to move her arms, and found 'em ty'd;
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>Then with a sigh, Some God assists ye, cry'd,
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>And in her proper shape stood blushing by his side.
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>About her waiste his longing arms he flung,
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>From which embrace the great Achilles sprung.
<A NAME="414"></A><BR><BR><B>The Transformation of Daedalion</B>
<A NAME="415"></A><BR><BR>Peleus unmix'd felicity enjoy'd
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>(Blest in a valiant son, and virtuous bride),
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>'Till Fortune did in blood his hands imbrue,
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>And his own brother by curst chance he slew:
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>Then driv'n from Thessaly, his native clime,
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>Trachinia first gave shelter to his crime;
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>Where peaceful Ceyx mildly fill'd the throne,
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>And like his sire, the morning planet, shone;
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>But now, unlike himself, bedew'd with tears,
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>Mourning a brother lost, his brow appears.
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>First to the town with travel spent, and care,
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>Peleus, and his small company repair:
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>His herds, and flocks the while at leisure feed,
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>On the rich pasture of a neighb'ring mead.
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>The prince before the royal presence brought,
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>Shew'd by the suppliant olive what he sought;
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>Then tells his name, and race, and country right,
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>But hides th' unhappy reason of his flight.
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>He begs the king some little town to give,
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>Where they may safe his faithful vassals live.
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>Ceyx reply'd: To all my bounty flows,
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>A hospitable realm your suit has chose.
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>Your glorious race, and far-resounding fame,
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>And grandsire Jove, peculiar favours claim.
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>All you can wish, I grant; entreaties spare;
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>My kingdom (would 'twere worth the sharing) share.
<A NAME="441"></A><BR><BR>Tears stop'd his speech: astonish'd Peleus pleads
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>To know the cause from whence his grief proceeds.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>The prince reply'd: There's none of ye but deems
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>This hawk was ever such as now it seems;
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>Know 'twas a heroe once, Daedalion nam'd,
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>For warlike deeds, and haughty valour fam'd;
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>Like me to that bright luminary born,
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>Who wakes Aurora, and brings on the morn.
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>His fierceness still remains, and love of blood,
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>Now dread of birds, and tyrant of the wood.
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>My make was softer, peace my greatest care;
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>But this my brother wholly bent on war;
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>Late nations fear'd, and routed armies fled
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>That force, which now the tim'rous pigeons dread.
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>A daughter he possess'd, divinely fair,
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>And scarcely yet had seen her fifteenth year;
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>Young Chione: a thousand rivals strove
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>To win the maid, and teach her how to love.
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>Phoebus, and Mercury by chance one day
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>From Delphi, and Cyllene past this way;
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>Together they the virgin saw: desire
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>At once warm'd both their breasts with am'rous fire.
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>Phoebus resolv'd to wait 'till close of day;
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>But Mercury's hot love brook'd no delay;
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>With his entrancing rod the maid he charms,
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>And unresisted revels in her arms.
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>'Twas night, and Phoebus in a beldam's dress,
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>To the late rifled beauty got access.
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>Her time compleat nine circling moons had run;
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>To either God she bore a lovely son:
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>To Mercury Autolycus she brought,
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>Who turn'd to thefts and tricks his subtle thought;
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>Possess'd he was of all his father's slight,
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>At will made white look black, and black look white.
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>Philammon born to Phoebus, like his sire,
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>The Muses lov'd, and finely struck the lyre,
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>And made his voice, and touch in harmony conspire.
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>In vain, fond maid, you boast this double birth,
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>The love of Gods, and royal father's worth,
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>And Jove among your ancestors rehearse!
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>Could blessings such as these e'er prove a curse?
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>To her they did, who with audacious pride,
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>Vain of her own, Diana's charms decry'd.
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>Her taunts the Goddess with resentment fill;
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>My face you like not, you shall try my skill.
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>She said; and strait her vengeful bow she strung,
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>And sent a shaft that pierc'd her guilty tongue:
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>The bleeding tongue in vain its accents tries;
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>In the red stream her soul reluctant flies.
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>With sorrow wild I ran to her relief,
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>And try'd to moderate my brother's grief.
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>He, deaf as rocks by stormy surges beat,
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>Loudly laments, and hears me not intreat.
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>When on the fun'ral pile he saw her laid,
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>Thrice he to rush into the flames assay'd,
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>Thrice with officious care by us was stay'd.
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>Now, mad with grief, away he fled amain,
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>Like a stung heifer that resents the pain,
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>And bellowing wildly bounds along the plain.
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>O'er the most rugged ways so fast he ran,
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>He seem'd a bird already, not a man:
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>He left us breathless all behind; and now
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>In quest of death had gain'd Parnassus' brow:
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>But when from thence headlong himself he threw,
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>He fell not, but with airy pinions flew.
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>Phoebus in pity chang'd him to a fowl,
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>Whose crooked beak and claws the birds controul,
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>Little of bulk, but of a warlike soul.
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>A hawk become, the feather'd race's foe,
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>He tries to case his own by other's woe.
<A NAME="511"></A><BR><BR><B>A Wolf turn'd into Marble</B>
<A NAME="512"></A><BR><BR>While they astonish'd heard the king relate
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>These wonders of his hapless brother's fate;
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>The prince's herdsman at the court arrives,
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>And fresh surprize to all the audience gives.
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>O Peleus, Peleus! dreadful news I bear,
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>He said; and trembled as he spoke for fear.
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>The worst, affrighted Peleus bid him tell,
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>Whilst Ceyx too grew pale with friendly zeal.
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>Thus he began: When Sol mid-heav'n had gain'd,
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>And half his way was past, and half remain'd,
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>I to the level shore my cattle drove,
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>And let them freely in the meadows rove.
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>Some stretch'd at length admire the watry plain,
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>Some crop'd the herb, some wanton swam the main.
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>A temple stands of antique make hard by,
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>Where no gilt domes, nor marble lure the eye;
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>Unpolish'd rafters bear its lowly height,
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>Hid by a grove, as ancient, from the sight.
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>Here Nereus, and the Nereids they adore;
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>I learnt it from the man who thither bore
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>His net, to dry it on the sunny shore.
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>Adjoyns a lake, inclos'd with willows round,
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>Where swelling waves have overflow'd the mound,
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>And, muddy, stagnate on the lower ground.
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>From thence a russling noise increasing flies,
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>Strikes the still shore; and frights us with surprize,
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>Strait a huge wolf rush'd from the marshy wood,
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>His jaws besmear'd with mingled foam, and blood,
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>Tho' equally by hunger urg'd, and rage,
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>His appetite he minds not to asswage;
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>Nought that he meets, his rabid fury spares,
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>But the whole herd with mad disorder tears.
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>Some of our men who strove to drive him thence,
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>Torn by his teeth, have dy'd in their defence.
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>The echoing lakes, the sea, and fields, and shore,
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>Impurpled blush with streams of reeking gore.
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>Delay is loss, nor have we time for thought;
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>While yet some few remain alive, we ought
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>To seize our arms, and with confederate force
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>Try if we so can stop his bloody course.
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>But Peleus car'd not for his ruin'd herd;
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>His crime he call'd to mind, and thence inferr'd,
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>That Psamathe's revenge this havock made,
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>In sacrifice to murder'd Phocus' shade.
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>The king commands his servants to their arms;
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>Resolv'd to go; but the loud noise alarms
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>His lovely queen, who from her chamber flew,
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>And her half-plaited hair behind her threw:
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>About his neck she hung with loving fears,
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>And now with words, and now with pleading tears,
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>Intreated that he'd send his men alone,
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>And stay himself, to save two lives in one.
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>Then Peleus: Your just fears, o queen, forget;
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>Too much the offer leaves me in your debt.
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>No arms against the monster I shall bear,
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>But the sea nymphs appease with humble pray'r.
<A NAME="568"></A><BR><BR>The citadel's high turrets pierce the sky,
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>Which home-bound vessels, glad, from far descry;
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>This they ascend, and thence with sorrow ken
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>The mangled heifers lye, and bleeding men;
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>Th' inexorable ravager they view,
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>With blood discolour'd, still the rest pursue:
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>There Peleus pray'd submissive tow'rds the sea,
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>And deprecates the ire of injur'd Psamathe.
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>But deaf to all his pray'rs the nymph remain'd,
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>'Till Thetis for her spouse the boon obtain'd.
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>Pleas'd with the luxury, the furious beast,
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>Unstop'd, continues still his bloody feast:
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>While yet upon a sturdy bull he flew,
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>Chang'd by the nymph, a marble block he grew.
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>No longer dreadful now the wolf appears,
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>Bury'd in stone, and vanish'd like their fears.
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>Yet still the Fates unhappy Peleus vex'd;
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>To the Magnesian shore he wanders next.
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>Acastus there, who rul'd the peaceful clime,
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>Grants his request, and expiates his crime.
<A NAME="588"></A><BR><BR><B>The Story of Ceyx and Alcyone</B>
<A NAME="589"></A><BR><BR>These prodigies affect the pious prince,
<A NAME="590"></A><BR>But more perplex'd with those that happen'd since,
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>He purposes to seek the Clarian God,
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>Avoiding Delphi, his more fam'd abode,
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>Since Phlegyan robbers made unsafe the road.
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>Yet could he not from her he lov'd so well,
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>The fatal voyage, he resolv'd, conceal;
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>But when she saw her lord prepar'd to part,
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>A deadly cold ran shiv'ring to her heart;
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>Her faded cheeks are chang'd to boxen hue,
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>And in her eyes the tears are ever new.
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>She thrice essay'd to speak; her accents hung,
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>And falt'ring dy'd unfinish'd on her tongue,
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>And vanish'd into sighs: with long delay
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>Her voice return'd, and found the wonted way.
<A NAME="604"></A><BR><BR>Tell me, my lord, she said, what fault unknown
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>Thy once belov'd Alcyone has done?
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>Whither, ah, whither, is thy kindness gone!
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>Can Ceyx then sustain to leave his wife,
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>And unconcern'd forsake the sweets of life?
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>What can thy mind to this long journey move?
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>Or need'st thou absence to renew thy love?
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>Yet, if thou go'st by land, tho' grief possess
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>My soul ev'n then, my fears will be the less.
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>But ah! be warn'd to shun the watry way,
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>The face is frightful of the stormy sea:
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>For late I saw a-drift disjointed planks,
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>And empty tombs erected on the banks.
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>Nor let false hopes to trust betray thy mind,
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>Because my sire in caves constrains the wind,
<A NAME="619"></A><BR>Can with a breath their clam'rous rage appease,
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>They fear his whistle, and forsake the seas:
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>Not so; for once indulg'd, they sweep the main;
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>Deaf to the call, or hearing, hear in vain;
<A NAME="623"></A><BR>But bent on mischief bear the waves before,
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>And not content with seas, insult the shore,
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>When ocean, air, and Earth, at once ingage,
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>And rooted forests fly before their rage:
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>At once the clashing clouds to battel move,
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>And lightnings run across the fields above:
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>I know them well, and mark'd their rude comport,
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>While yet a child within my father's court:
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>In times of tempest they command alone,
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>And he but sits precarious on the throne:
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>The more I know, the more my fears augment;
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>And fears are oft prophetick of th' event.
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>But if not fears, or reasons will prevail,
<A NAME="636"></A><BR>If Fate has fix'd thee obstinate to sail,
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>Go not without thy wife, but let me bear
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>My part of danger with an equal share,
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>And present, what I suffer only fear:
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>Then o'er the bounding billows shall we fly,
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>Secure to live together, or to die.
<A NAME="642"></A><BR><BR>These reasons mov'd her warlike husband's heart,
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>But still he held his purpose to depart:
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>For as he lov'd her equal to his life,
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>He would not to the seas expose his wife;
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>Nor could be wrought his voyage to refrain,
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>But sought by arguments to sooth her pain:
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>Nor these avail'd; at length he lights on one,
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>With which so difficult a cause he won:
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>My love, so short an absence cease to fear,
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>For by my father's holy flame I swear,
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>Before two moons their orb with light adorn,
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>If Heav'n allow me life, I will return.
<A NAME="654"></A><BR><BR>This promise of so short a stay prevails;
<A NAME="655"></A><BR>He soon equips the ship, supplies the sails,
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>And gives the word to launch; she trembling views
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>This pomp of death, and parting tears renews:
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>Last with a kiss, she took a long farewel,
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>Sigh'd with a sad presage, and swooning fell:
<A NAME="660"></A><BR>While Ceyx seeks delays, the lusty crew,
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>Rais'd on their banks, their oars in order drew
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>To their broad breasts, the ship with fury flew.
<A NAME="663"></A><BR><BR>The queen recover'd, rears her humid eyes,
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>And first her husband on the poop espies,
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>Shaking his hand at distance on the main;
<A NAME="666"></A><BR>She took the sign, and shook her hand again.
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>Still as the ground recedes, contracts her view
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>With sharpen'd sight, 'till she no longer knew
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>The much-lov'd face; that comfort lost supplies
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>With less, and with the galley feeds her eyes;
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>The galley born from view by rising gales,
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>She follow'd with her sight the flying sails:
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>When ev'n the flying sails were seen no more,
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>Forsaken of all sight she left the shore.
<A NAME="675"></A><BR><BR>Then on her bridal bed her body throws,
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>And sought in sleep her wearied eyes to close:
<A NAME="677"></A><BR>Her husband's pillow, and the widow'd part
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>Which once he press'd, renew'd the former smart.
<A NAME="679"></A><BR><BR>And now a breeze from shoar began to blow,
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>The sailors ship their oars, and cease to row;
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>Then hoist their yards a-trip, and all their sails
<A NAME="682"></A><BR>Let fall, to court the wind, and catch the gales:
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>By this the vessel half her course had run,
<A NAME="684"></A><BR>Both shoars were lost to sight, when at the close
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>Of day a stiffer gale at east arose:
<A NAME="686"></A><BR>The sea grew white, the rouling waves from far,
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>Like heralds, first denounce the watry war.
<A NAME="688"></A><BR><BR>This seen, the master soon began to cry,
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>Strike, strike the top-sail; let the main-sheet 
<A NAME="690"></A>fly,
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>And furl your sails: the winds repel the sound,
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>And in the speaker's mouth the speech is drown'd.
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>Yet of their own accord, as danger taught
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>Each in his way, officiously they wrought;
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>Some stow their oars, or stop the leaky sides,
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>Another bolder, yet the yard bestrides,
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>And folds the sails; a fourth with labour laves
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>Th' intruding seas, and waves ejects on waves.
<A NAME="699"></A><BR><BR>In this confusion while their work they ply,
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>The winds augment the winter of the sky,
<A NAME="701"></A><BR>And wage intestine wars; the suff'ring seas
<A NAME="702"></A><BR>Are toss'd, and mingled, as their tyrants please.
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>The master would command, but in despair
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>Of safety, stands amaz'd with stupid care,
<A NAME="705"></A><BR>Nor what to bid, or what forbid he knows,
<A NAME="706"></A><BR>Th' ungovern'd tempest to such fury grows:
<A NAME="707"></A><BR>Vain is his force, and vainer is his skill;
<A NAME="708"></A><BR>With such a concourse comes the flood of ill;
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>The cries of men are mix'd with rattling shrowds;
<A NAME="710"></A><BR>Seas dash on seas, and clouds encounter clouds:
<A NAME="711"></A><BR>At once from east to west, from pole to pole,
<A NAME="712"></A><BR>The forky lightnings flash, the roaring thunders 
<A NAME="713"></A>roul.
<A NAME="714"></A><BR><BR>Now waves on waves ascending scale the skies,
<A NAME="715"></A><BR>And in the fires above the water fries:
<A NAME="716"></A><BR>When yellow sands are sifted from below,
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>The glittering billows give a golden show:
<A NAME="718"></A><BR>And when the fouler bottom spews the black
<A NAME="719"></A><BR>The Stygian dye the tainted waters take:
<A NAME="720"></A><BR>Then frothy white appear the flatted seas,
<A NAME="721"></A><BR>And change their colour, changing their disease,
<A NAME="722"></A><BR>Like various fits the Trachin vessel finds,
<A NAME="723"></A><BR>And now sublime, she rides upon the winds;
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>As from a lofty summit looks from high,
<A NAME="725"></A><BR>And from the clouds beholds the nether sky;
<A NAME="726"></A><BR>Now from the depth of Hell they lift their sight,
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>And at a distance see superior light;
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>The lashing billows make a loud report,
<A NAME="729"></A><BR>And beat her sides, as batt'ring rams a fort:
<A NAME="730"></A><BR>Or as a lion bounding in his way,
<A NAME="731"></A><BR>With force augmented, bears against his prey,
<A NAME="732"></A><BR>Sidelong to seize; or unapal'd with fear,
<A NAME="733"></A><BR>Springs on the toils, and rushes on the spear:
<A NAME="734"></A><BR>So seas impell'd by winds, with added pow'r
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>Assault the sides, and o'er the hatches tow'r.
<A NAME="736"></A><BR><BR>The planks (their pitchy cov'ring wash'd away)
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>Now yield; and now a yawning breach display:
<A NAME="738"></A><BR>The roaring waters with a hostile tide
<A NAME="739"></A><BR>Rush through the ruins of her gaping side.
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>Mean-time in sheets of rain the sky descends,
<A NAME="741"></A><BR>And ocean swell'd with waters upwards tends;
<A NAME="742"></A><BR>One rising, falling one, the Heav'ns and sea
<A NAME="743"></A><BR>Meet at their confines, in the middle way:
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>The sails are drunk with show'rs, and drop with 
<A NAME="745"></A>rain,
<A NAME="746"></A><BR>Sweet waters mingle with the briny main.
<A NAME="747"></A><BR>No star appears to lend his friendly light;
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>Darkness, and tempest make a double night;
<A NAME="749"></A><BR>But flashing fires disclose the deep by turns,
<A NAME="750"></A><BR>And while the lightnings blaze, the water burns.
<A NAME="751"></A><BR><BR>Now all the waves their scatter'd force unite,
<A NAME="752"></A><BR>And as a soldier foremost in the fight,
<A NAME="753"></A><BR>Makes way for others, and an host alone
<A NAME="754"></A><BR>Still presses on, and urging gains the town;
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>So while th' invading billows come a-breast,
<A NAME="756"></A><BR>The hero tenth advanc'd before the rest,
<A NAME="757"></A><BR>Sweeps all before him with impetuous sway,
<A NAME="758"></A><BR>And from the walls descends upon the prey;
<A NAME="759"></A><BR>Part following enter, part remain without,
<A NAME="760"></A><BR>With envy hear their fellows' conqu'ring shout,
<A NAME="761"></A><BR>And mount on others' backs, in hopes to share
<A NAME="762"></A><BR>The city, thus become the seat of war.
<A NAME="763"></A><BR><BR>An universal cry resounds aloud,
<A NAME="764"></A><BR>The sailors run in heaps, a helpless crowd;
<A NAME="765"></A><BR>Art fails, and courage falls, no succour near;
<A NAME="766"></A><BR>As many waves, as many deaths appear.
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>One weeps, and yet despairs of late relief;
<A NAME="768"></A><BR>One cannot weep, his fears congeal his grief,
<A NAME="769"></A><BR>But stupid, with dry eyes expects his fate:
<A NAME="770"></A><BR>One with loud shrieks laments his lost estate,
<A NAME="771"></A><BR>And calls those happy whom their fun'rals wait.
<A NAME="772"></A><BR>This wretch with pray'rs and vows the Gods implores,
<A NAME="773"></A><BR>And ev'n the skies he cannot see, adores.
<A NAME="774"></A><BR>That other on his friends his thoughts bestows,
<A NAME="775"></A><BR>His careful father, and his faithful spouse.
<A NAME="776"></A><BR>The covetous worldling in his anxious mind,
<A NAME="777"></A><BR>Thinks only on the wealth he left behind.
<A NAME="778"></A><BR><BR>All Ceyx his Alcyone employs,
<A NAME="779"></A><BR>For her he grieves, yet in her absence joys:
<A NAME="780"></A><BR>His wife he wishes, and would still be near,
<A NAME="781"></A><BR>Not her with him, but wishes him with her:
<A NAME="782"></A><BR>Now with last looks he seeks his native shoar,
<A NAME="783"></A><BR>Which Fate has destin'd him to see no more;
<A NAME="784"></A><BR>He sought, but in the dark tempestuous night
<A NAME="785"></A><BR>He knew not whither to direct his sight.
<A NAME="786"></A><BR>So whirl the seas, such darkness blinds the sky,
<A NAME="787"></A><BR>That the black night receives a deeper dye.
<A NAME="788"></A><BR><BR>The giddy ship ran round; the tempest tore
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>Her mast, and over-board the rudder bore.
<A NAME="790"></A><BR>One billow mounts, and with a scornful brow,
<A NAME="791"></A><BR>Proud of her conquest gain'd, insults the waves 
<A NAME="792"></A>below;
<A NAME="793"></A><BR>Nor lighter falls, than if some giant tore
<A NAME="794"></A><BR>Pindus and Athos with the freight they bore,
<A NAME="795"></A><BR>And toss'd on seas; press'd with the pond'rous blow,
<A NAME="796"></A><BR>Down sinks the ship within th' abyss below:
<A NAME="797"></A><BR>Down with the vessel sink into the main
<A NAME="798"></A><BR>The many, never more to rise again.
<A NAME="799"></A><BR>Some few on scatter'd planks, with fruitless care,
<A NAME="800"></A><BR>Lay hold, and swim; but while they swim, despair.
<A NAME="801"></A><BR><BR>Ev'n he who late a scepter did command,
<A NAME="802"></A><BR>Now grasps a floating fragment in his hand;
<A NAME="803"></A><BR>And while he struggles on the stormy main,
<A NAME="804"></A><BR>Invokes his father, and his wife's, in vain.
<A NAME="805"></A><BR>But yet his consort is his greatest care,
<A NAME="806"></A><BR>Alcyone he names amidst his pray'r;
<A NAME="807"></A><BR>Names as a charm against the waves and wind;
<A NAME="808"></A><BR>Most in his mouth, and ever in his mind.
<A NAME="809"></A><BR>Tir'd with his toil, all hopes of safety past,
<A NAME="810"></A><BR>From pray'rs to wishes he descends at last;
<A NAME="811"></A><BR>That his dead body, wafted to the sands,
<A NAME="812"></A><BR>Might have its burial from her friendly hands,
<A NAME="813"></A><BR>As oft as he can catch a gulp of air,
<A NAME="814"></A><BR>And peep above the seas, he names the fair;
<A NAME="815"></A><BR>And ev'n when plung'd beneath, on her he raves,
<A NAME="816"></A><BR>Murm'ring Alcyone below the waves:
<A NAME="817"></A><BR>At last a falling billow stops his breath,
<A NAME="818"></A><BR>Breaks o'er his head, and whelms him underneath.
<A NAME="819"></A><BR>That night, his heav'nly form obscur'd with tears,
<A NAME="820"></A><BR>And since he was forbid to leave the skies,
<A NAME="821"></A><BR>He muffled with a cloud his mournful eyes.
<A NAME="822"></A><BR><BR>Mean-time Alcyone (his fate unknown)
<A NAME="823"></A><BR>Computes how many nights he had been gone.
<A NAME="824"></A><BR>Observes the waining moon with hourly view,
<A NAME="825"></A><BR>Numbers her age, and wishes for a new;
<A NAME="826"></A><BR>Against the promis'd time provides with care,
<A NAME="827"></A><BR>And hastens in the woof the robes he was to wear:
<A NAME="828"></A><BR>And for her self employs another loom,
<A NAME="829"></A><BR>New-dress'd to meet her lord returning home,
<A NAME="830"></A><BR>Flatt'ring her heart with joys, that never were to 
<A NAME="831"></A>come:
<A NAME="832"></A><BR>She fum'd the temples with an od'rous flame,
<A NAME="833"></A><BR>And oft before the sacred altars came,
<A NAME="834"></A><BR>To pray for him, who was an empty name.
<A NAME="835"></A><BR>All Pow'rs implor'd, but far above the rest
<A NAME="836"></A><BR>To Juno she her pious vows address'd,
<A NAME="837"></A><BR>Her much-lov'd lord from perils to protect,
<A NAME="838"></A><BR>And safe o'er seas his voyage to direct:
<A NAME="839"></A><BR>Then pray'd, that she might still possess his heart,
<A NAME="840"></A><BR>And no pretending rival share a part;
<A NAME="841"></A><BR>This last petition heard of all her pray'r,
<A NAME="842"></A><BR>The rest, dispers'd by winds, were lost in air.
<A NAME="843"></A><BR><BR>But she, the Goddess of the nuptial bed,
<A NAME="844"></A><BR>Tir'd with her vain devotions for the dead,
<A NAME="845"></A><BR>Resolv'd the tainted hand should be repell'd,
<A NAME="846"></A><BR>Which incense offer'd, and her altar held:
<A NAME="847"></A><BR>Then Iris thus bespoke: Thou faithful maid,
<A NAME="848"></A><BR>By whom thy queen's commands are well convey'd,
<A NAME="849"></A><BR>Haste to the house of sleep, and bid the God
<A NAME="850"></A><BR>Who rules the night by visions with a nod,
<A NAME="851"></A><BR>Prepare a dream, in figure, and in form
<A NAME="852"></A><BR>Resembling him, who perish'd in the storm;
<A NAME="853"></A><BR>This form before Alcyone present,
<A NAME="854"></A><BR>To make her certain of the sad event.
<A NAME="855"></A><BR><BR>Indu'd with robes of various hue she flies,
<A NAME="856"></A><BR>And flying draws an arch (a segment of the skies):
<A NAME="857"></A><BR>Then leaves her bending bow, and from the steep
<A NAME="858"></A><BR>Descends, to search the silent house of sleep.
<A NAME="859"></A><BR><BR><B>The House of Sleep</B>
<A NAME="860"></A><BR><BR>Near the Cymmerians, in his dark abode,
<A NAME="861"></A><BR>Deep in a cavern, dwells the drowzy God;
<A NAME="862"></A><BR>Whose gloomy mansion nor the rising sun,
<A NAME="863"></A><BR>Nor setting, visits, nor the lightsome noon;
<A NAME="864"></A><BR>But lazy vapours round the region fly,
<A NAME="865"></A><BR>Perpetual twilight, and a doubtful sky:
<A NAME="866"></A><BR>No crowing cock does there his wings display,
<A NAME="867"></A><BR>Nor with his horny bill provoke the day;
<A NAME="868"></A><BR>Nor watchful dogs, nor the more wakeful geese,
<A NAME="869"></A><BR>Disturb with nightly noise the sacred peace;
<A NAME="870"></A><BR>Nor beast of Nature, nor the tame are nigh,
<A NAME="871"></A><BR>Nor trees with tempests rock'd, nor human cry;
<A NAME="872"></A><BR>But safe repose without an air of breath
<A NAME="873"></A><BR>Dwells here, and a dumb quiet next to death.
<A NAME="874"></A><BR><BR>An arm of Lethe, with a gentle flow
<A NAME="875"></A><BR>Arising upwards from the rock below,
<A NAME="876"></A><BR>The palace moats, and o'er the pebbles creeps,
<A NAME="877"></A><BR>And with soft murmurs calls the coming sleeps.
<A NAME="878"></A><BR>Around its entry nodding poppies grow,
<A NAME="879"></A><BR>And all cool simples that sweet rest bestow;
<A NAME="880"></A><BR>Night from the plants their sleepy virtue drains,
<A NAME="881"></A><BR>And passing, sheds it on the silent plains:
<A NAME="882"></A><BR>No door there was th' unguarded house to keep,
<A NAME="883"></A><BR>On creaking hinges turn'd, to break his sleep.
<A NAME="884"></A><BR><BR>But in the gloomy court was rais'd a bed,
<A NAME="885"></A><BR>Stuff'd with black plumes, and on an ebon-sted:
<A NAME="886"></A><BR>Black was the cov'ring too, where lay the God,
<A NAME="887"></A><BR>And slept supine, his limbs display'd abroad:
<A NAME="888"></A><BR>About his head fantastick visions fly,
<A NAME="889"></A><BR>Which various images of things supply,
<A NAME="890"></A><BR>And mock their forms; the leaves on trees not more,
<A NAME="891"></A><BR>Nor bearded ears in fields, nor sands upon the shore.
<A NAME="892"></A><BR><BR>The virgin ent'ring bright, indulg'd the day
<A NAME="893"></A><BR>To the brown cave, and brush'd the dreams away:
<A NAME="894"></A><BR>The God disturb'd with this new glare of light,
<A NAME="895"></A><BR>Cast sudden on his face, unseal'd his sight,
<A NAME="896"></A><BR>And rais'd his tardy head, which sunk again,
<A NAME="897"></A><BR>And sinking, on his bosom knock'd his chin;
<A NAME="898"></A><BR>At length shook off himself, and ask'd the dame,
<A NAME="899"></A><BR>(And asking yawn'd) for what intent she came.
<A NAME="900"></A><BR><BR>To whom the Goddess thus: O sacred rest,
<A NAME="901"></A><BR>Sweet pleasing sleep, of all the Pow'rs the best!
<A NAME="902"></A><BR>O peace of mind, repairer of decay,
<A NAME="903"></A><BR>Whose balms renew the limbs to labours of the day,
<A NAME="904"></A><BR>Care shuns thy soft approach, and sullen flies away!
<A NAME="905"></A><BR>Adorn a dream, expressing human form,
<A NAME="906"></A><BR>The shape of him who suffer'd in the storm,
<A NAME="907"></A><BR>And send it flitting to the Trachin court,
<A NAME="908"></A><BR>The wreck of wretched Ceyx to report:
<A NAME="909"></A><BR>Before his queen bid the pale spectre stand,
<A NAME="910"></A><BR>Who begs a vain relief at Juno's hand.
<A NAME="911"></A><BR>She said, and scarce awake her eyes could keep,
<A NAME="912"></A><BR>Unable to support the fumes of sleep;
<A NAME="913"></A><BR>But fled, returning by the way she went,
<A NAME="914"></A><BR>And swerv'd along her bow with swift ascent.
<A NAME="915"></A><BR><BR>The God, uneasy 'till he slept again,
<A NAME="916"></A><BR>Resolv'd at once to rid himself of pain;
<A NAME="917"></A><BR>And, tho' against his custom, call'd aloud,
<A NAME="918"></A><BR>Exciting Morpheus from the sleepy crowd:
<A NAME="919"></A><BR>Morpheus, of all his numerous train, express'd
<A NAME="920"></A><BR>The shape of man, and imitated best;
<A NAME="921"></A><BR>The walk, the words, the gesture could supply,
<A NAME="922"></A><BR>The habit mimick, and the mein bely;
<A NAME="923"></A><BR>Plays well, but all his action is confin'd,
<A NAME="924"></A><BR>Extending not beyond our human kind.
<A NAME="925"></A><BR>Another, birds, and beasts, and dragons apes,
<A NAME="926"></A><BR>And dreadful images, and monster shapes:
<A NAME="927"></A><BR>This demon, Icelos, in Heav'n's high hall
<A NAME="928"></A><BR>The Gods have nam'd; but men Phobetor call.
<A NAME="929"></A><BR>A third is Phantasus, whose actions roul
<A NAME="930"></A><BR>On meaner thoughts, and things devoid of soul;
<A NAME="931"></A><BR>Earth, fruits, and flow'rs he represents in dreams,
<A NAME="932"></A><BR>And solid rocks unmov'd, and running streams.
<A NAME="933"></A><BR>These three to kings, and chiefs their scenes display,
<A NAME="934"></A><BR>The rest before th' ignoble commons play.
<A NAME="935"></A><BR>Of these the chosen Morpheus is dispatch'd;
<A NAME="936"></A><BR>Which done, the lazy monarch, over-watch'd,
<A NAME="937"></A><BR>Down from his propping elbow drops his head,
<A NAME="938"></A><BR>Dissolv'd in sleep, and shrinks within his bed.
<A NAME="939"></A><BR><BR>Darkling the demon glides, for flight prepar'd,
<A NAME="940"></A><BR>So soft, that scarce his fanning wings are heard.
<A NAME="941"></A><BR>To Trachin, swift as thought, the flitting shade,
<A NAME="942"></A><BR>Thro' air his momentary journey made:
<A NAME="943"></A><BR>Then lays aside the steerage of his wings,
<A NAME="944"></A><BR>Forsakes his proper form, assumes the king's;
<A NAME="945"></A><BR>And pale, as death, despoil'd of his array,
<A NAME="946"></A><BR>Into the queen's apartment takes his way,
<A NAME="947"></A><BR>And stands before the bed at dawn of day:
<A NAME="948"></A><BR>Unmov'd his eyes, and wet his beard appears;
<A NAME="949"></A><BR>And shedding vain, but seeming real tears;
<A NAME="950"></A><BR>The briny waters dropping from his hairs.
<A NAME="951"></A><BR>Then staring on her with a ghastly look,
<A NAME="952"></A><BR>And hollow voice, he thus the queen bespoke.
<A NAME="953"></A><BR><BR>Know'st thou not me? Not yet, unhappy wife?
<A NAME="954"></A><BR>Or are my features perish'd with my life?
<A NAME="955"></A><BR>Look once again, and for thy husband lost,
<A NAME="956"></A><BR>Lo all that's left of him, thy husband's ghost!
<A NAME="957"></A><BR>Thy vows for my return were all in vain,
<A NAME="958"></A><BR>The stormy south o'ertook us in the main,
<A NAME="959"></A><BR>And never shalt thou see thy living lord again.
<A NAME="960"></A><BR>Bear witness, Heav'n, I call'd on thee in death,
<A NAME="961"></A><BR>And while I call'd, a billow stop'd my breath.
<A NAME="962"></A><BR>Think not, that flying fame reports my fate;
<A NAME="963"></A><BR>I present, I appear, and my own wreck relate.
<A NAME="964"></A><BR>Rise, wretched widow, rise; nor undeplor'd
<A NAME="965"></A><BR>Permit my soul to pass the Stygian ford;
<A NAME="966"></A><BR>But rise, prepar'd in black, to mourn thy perish'd 
<A NAME="967"></A>lord.
<A NAME="968"></A><BR><BR>Thus said the player-God; and adding art
<A NAME="969"></A><BR>Of voice and gesture, so perform'd his part,
<A NAME="970"></A><BR>She thought (so like her love the shade appears)
<A NAME="971"></A><BR>That Ceyx spake the words, and Ceyx shed the tears;
<A NAME="972"></A><BR>She groan'd, her inward soul with grief opprest,
<A NAME="973"></A><BR>She sigh'd, she wept, and sleeping beat her breast;
<A NAME="974"></A><BR>Then stretch'd her arms t' embrace his body bare;
<A NAME="975"></A><BR>Her clasping arms inclose but empty air:
<A NAME="976"></A><BR>At this, not yet awake, she cry'd, O stay;
<A NAME="977"></A><BR>One is our fate, and common is our way!
<A NAME="978"></A><BR><BR>So dreadful was the dream, so loud she spoke,
<A NAME="979"></A><BR>That starting sudden up, the slumber broke:
<A NAME="980"></A><BR>Then cast her eyes around, in hope to view
<A NAME="981"></A><BR>Her vanish'd lord, and find the vision true:
<A NAME="982"></A><BR>For now the maids, who waited her commands,
<A NAME="983"></A><BR>Ran in with lighted tapers in their hands.
<A NAME="984"></A><BR>Tir'd with the search, not finding what she seeks,
<A NAME="985"></A><BR>With cruel blows she pounds her blubber'd cheeks;
<A NAME="986"></A><BR>Then from her beaten breast the linnen tare,
<A NAME="987"></A><BR>And cut the golden caul that bound her hair.
<A NAME="988"></A><BR>Her nurse demands the cause; with louder cries
<A NAME="989"></A><BR>She prosecutes her griefs, and thus replies.
<A NAME="990"></A><BR><BR>No more Alcyone; she suffer'd death
<A NAME="991"></A><BR>With her lov'd lord, when Ceyx lost his breath:
<A NAME="992"></A><BR>No flatt'ry, no false comfort, give me none,
<A NAME="993"></A><BR>My shipwreck'd Ceyx is for ever gone:
<A NAME="994"></A><BR>I saw, I saw him manifest in view,
<A NAME="995"></A><BR>His voice, his figure, and his gestures knew:
<A NAME="996"></A><BR>His lustre lost, and ev'ry living grace,
<A NAME="997"></A><BR>Yet I retain'd the features of his face;
<A NAME="998"></A><BR>Tho' with pale cheeks, wet beard, and dropping hair,
<A NAME="999"></A><BR>None but my Ceyx could appear so fair:
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR>I would have strain'd him with a strict embrace,
<A NAME="1001"></A><BR>But thro' my arms he slipt, and vanish'd from the 
<A NAME="1002"></A>place:
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR>There, ev'n just there he stood; and as she spoke,
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR>Where last the spectre was she cast her look:
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR>Fain would she hope, and gaz'd upon the ground,
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR>If any printed footsteps might be found.
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR><BR>Then sigh'd, and said: This I too well foreknew,
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR>And my prophetick fears presag'd too true:
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR>'Twas what I begg'd, when with a bleeding heart
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR>I took my leave, and suffer'd thee to part;
<A NAME="1011"></A><BR>Or I to go along, or thou to stay,
<A NAME="1012"></A><BR>Never, ah never to divide our way!
<A NAME="1013"></A><BR>Happier for me, that all our hours assign'd
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR>Together we had liv'd; ev'n not in death disjoin'd!
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR>So had my Ceyx still been living here,
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR>Or with my Ceyx I had perish'd there:
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR>Now I die absent, in the vast profound;
<A NAME="1018"></A><BR>And me, without my self, the seas have drown'd.
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR>The storms were not so cruel: should I strive
<A NAME="1020"></A><BR>To lengthen life, and such a grief survive;
<A NAME="1021"></A><BR>But neither will I strive, nor wretched thee
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR>In death forsake, but keep thee company.
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR>If not one common sepulchre contains
<A NAME="1024"></A><BR>Our bodies, or one urn our last remains,
<A NAME="1025"></A><BR>Yet Ceyx and Alcyone shall join,
<A NAME="1026"></A><BR>Their names remember'd in one common line.
<A NAME="1027"></A><BR><BR>No farther voice her mighty grief affords,
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR>For sighs come rushing in betwixt her words,
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR>And stop'd her tongue; but what her tongue deny'd,
<A NAME="1030"></A><BR>Soft tears, and groans, and dumb complaints supply'd.
<A NAME="1031"></A><BR><BR>'Twas morning; to the port she takes her way,
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR>And stands upon the margin of the sea:
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR>That place, that very spot of ground she sought,
<A NAME="1034"></A><BR>Or thither by her destiny was brought,
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR>Where last he stood: and while she sadly said,
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR>'Twas here he left me, lingring here delay'd
<A NAME="1037"></A><BR>His parting kiss, and there his anchors weigh'd.
<A NAME="1038"></A><BR><BR>Thus speaking, while her thoughts past actions 
<A NAME="1039"></A>trace,
<A NAME="1040"></A><BR>And call to mind, admonish'd by the place,
<A NAME="1041"></A><BR>Sharp at her utmost ken she cast her eyes,
<A NAME="1042"></A><BR>And somewhat floating from afar descries:
<A NAME="1043"></A><BR>It seems a corps a-drift to distant sight,
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR>But at a distance who could judge aright?
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR>It wafted nearer yet, and then she knew,
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR>That what before she but surmis'd, was true:
<A NAME="1047"></A><BR>A corps it was, but whose it was, unknown,
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR>Yet mov'd, howe'er, she made the cause her own.
<A NAME="1049"></A><BR>Took the bad omen of a shipwreck'd man,
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR>As for a stranger wept, and thus began.
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR><BR>Poor wretch, on stormy seas to lose thy life,
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR>Unhappy thou, but more thy widow'd wife;
<A NAME="1053"></A><BR>At this she paus'd: for now the flowing tide
<A NAME="1054"></A><BR>Had brought the body nearer to the side:
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR>The more she looks, the more her fears increase,
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR>At nearer sight; and she's her self the less:
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR>Now driv'n ashore, and at her feet it lies,
<A NAME="1058"></A><BR>She knows too much in knowing whom she sees:
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR>Her husband's corps; at this she loudly shrieks,
<A NAME="1060"></A><BR>'Tis he, 'tis he, she cries, and tears her cheeks,
<A NAME="1061"></A><BR>Her hair, and vest; and stooping to the sands,
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR>About his neck she cast her trembling hands.
<A NAME="1063"></A><BR><BR>And is it thus, o dearer than my life,
<A NAME="1064"></A><BR>Thus, thus return'st thou to thy longing wife!
<A NAME="1065"></A><BR>She said, and to the neighbouring mole she strode,
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR>(Rais'd there to break th' incursions of the flood).
<A NAME="1067"></A><BR><BR>Headlong from hence to plunge her self she springs,
<A NAME="1068"></A><BR>But shoots along, supported on her wings;
<A NAME="1069"></A><BR>A bird new-made, about the banks she plies,
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR>Not far from shore, and short excursions tries;
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR>Nor seeks in air her humble flight to raise,
<A NAME="1072"></A><BR>Content to skim the surface of the seas:
<A NAME="1073"></A><BR>Her bill tho' slender, sends a creaking noise,
<A NAME="1074"></A><BR>And imitates a lamentable voice.
<A NAME="1075"></A><BR>Now lighting where the bloodless body lies,
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR>She with a fun'ral note renews her cries:
<A NAME="1077"></A><BR>At all her stretch, her little wings she spread,
<A NAME="1078"></A><BR>And with her feather'd arms embrac'd the dead:
<A NAME="1079"></A><BR>Then flick'ring to his palid lips, she strove
<A NAME="1080"></A><BR>To print a kiss, the last essay of love.
<A NAME="1081"></A><BR>Whether the vital touch reviv'd the dead,
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR>Or that the moving waters rais'd his head
<A NAME="1083"></A><BR>To meet the kiss, the vulgar doubt alone;
<A NAME="1084"></A><BR>For sure a present miracle was shown.
<A NAME="1085"></A><BR>The Gods their shapes to winter-birds translate,
<A NAME="1086"></A><BR>But both obnoxious to their former fate.
<A NAME="1087"></A><BR>Their conjugal affection still is ty'd,
<A NAME="1088"></A><BR>And still the mournful race is multiply'd:
<A NAME="1089"></A><BR>They bill, they tread; Alcyone compress'd,
<A NAME="1090"></A><BR>Sev'n days sits brooding on her floating nest:
<A NAME="1091"></A><BR>A wintry queen: her sire at length is kind,
<A NAME="1092"></A><BR>Calms ev'ry storm, and hushes ev'ry wind;
<A NAME="1093"></A><BR>Prepares his empire for his daughter's ease,
<A NAME="1094"></A><BR>And for his hatching nephews smooths the seas.
<A NAME="1095"></A><BR><BR><B>Aesacus transform'd into a Cormorant</B>
<A NAME="1096"></A><BR><BR>These some old man sees wanton in the air,
<A NAME="1097"></A><BR>And praises the unhappy constant pair.
<A NAME="1098"></A><BR>Then to his friend the long-neck'd corm'rant shows,
<A NAME="1099"></A><BR>The former tale reviving others' woes:
<A NAME="1100"></A><BR>That sable bird, he cries, which cuts the flood
<A NAME="1101"></A><BR>With slender legs, was once of royal blood;
<A NAME="1102"></A><BR>His ancestors from mighty Tros proceed,
<A NAME="1103"></A><BR>The brave Laomedon, and Ganymede
<A NAME="1104"></A><BR>(Whose beauty tempted Jove to steal the boy),
<A NAME="1105"></A><BR>And Priam, hapless prince! who fell with Troy:
<A NAME="1106"></A><BR>Himself was Hector's brother, and (had Fate
<A NAME="1107"></A><BR>But giv'n this hopeful youth a longer date)
<A NAME="1108"></A><BR>Perhaps had rival'd warlike Hector's worth,
<A NAME="1109"></A><BR>Tho' on the mother's side of meaner birth;
<A NAME="1110"></A><BR>Fair Alyxothoe, a country maid,
<A NAME="1111"></A><BR>Bare Aesacus by stealth in Ida's shade.
<A NAME="1112"></A><BR>He fled the noisy town, and pompous court,
<A NAME="1113"></A><BR>Lov'd the lone hills, and simple rural sport.
<A NAME="1114"></A><BR>And seldom to the city would resort.
<A NAME="1115"></A><BR>Yet he no rustick clownishness profest,
<A NAME="1116"></A><BR>Nor was soft love a stranger to his breast:
<A NAME="1117"></A><BR>The youth had long the nymph Hesperie woo'd,
<A NAME="1118"></A><BR>Oft thro' the thicket, or the mead pursu'd:
<A NAME="1119"></A><BR>Her haply on her father's bank he spy'd,
<A NAME="1120"></A><BR>While fearless she her silver tresses dry'd;
<A NAME="1121"></A><BR>Away she fled: not stags with half such speed,
<A NAME="1122"></A><BR>Before the prowling wolf, scud o'er the mead;
<A NAME="1123"></A><BR>Not ducks, when they the safer flood forsake,
<A NAME="1124"></A><BR>Pursu'd by hawks, so swift regain the lake.
<A NAME="1125"></A><BR>As fast he follow'd in the hot career;
<A NAME="1126"></A><BR>Desire the lover wing'd, the virgin fear.
<A NAME="1127"></A><BR>A snake unseen now pierc'd her heedless foot;
<A NAME="1128"></A><BR>Quick thro' the veins the venom'd juices shoot:
<A NAME="1129"></A><BR>She fell, and 'scap'd by death his fierce pursuit;
<A NAME="1130"></A><BR>Her lifeless body, frighted, he embrac'd,
<A NAME="1131"></A><BR>And cry'd, Not this I dreaded, but thy haste:
<A NAME="1132"></A><BR>O had my love been less, or less thy fear!
<A NAME="1133"></A><BR>The victory, thus bought, is far too dear.
<A NAME="1134"></A><BR>Accursed snake! yet I more curs'd than he!
<A NAME="1135"></A><BR>He gave the wound; the cause was given by me.
<A NAME="1136"></A><BR>Yet none shall say, that unreveng'd you dy'd.
<A NAME="1137"></A><BR>He spoke; then climb'd a cliff's o'er-hanging side,
<A NAME="1138"></A><BR>And, resolute, leap'd on the foaming tide.
<A NAME="1139"></A><BR>Tethys receiv'd him gently on the wave;
<A NAME="1140"></A><BR>The death he sought deny'd, and feathers gave.
<A NAME="1141"></A><BR>Debarr'd the surest remedy of grief,
<A NAME="1142"></A><BR>And forc'd to live, he curst th' unask'd relief.
<A NAME="1143"></A><BR>Then on his airy pinions upward flies,
<A NAME="1144"></A><BR>And at a second fall successless tries;
<A NAME="1145"></A><BR>The downy plume a quick descent denies.
<A NAME="1146"></A><BR>Enrag'd, he often dives beneath the wave,
<A NAME="1147"></A><BR>And there in vain expects to find a grave.
<A NAME="1148"></A><BR>His ceaseless sorrow for th' unhappy maid,
<A NAME="1149"></A><BR>Meager'd his look, and on his spirits prey'd.
<A NAME="1150"></A><BR>Still near the sounding deep he lives; his name
<A NAME="1151"></A><BR>From frequent diving and emerging came.
