<A NAME="10"></A><B>Chapter  38</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A><B>1.</B> (Those who) possessed in highest degree the attributes (of the 
<A NAME="12"></A>Tao) did not (seek) to show them, and therefore they possessed them (in 
<A NAME="13"></A>fullest measure).  (Those who) possessed in a lower degree those attributes 
<A NAME="14"></A>(sought how) not to lose them, and therefore they did not possess them 
<A NAME="15"></A>(in fullest measure).
<A NAME="16"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> (Those who) possessed in the highest degree those attributes 
<A NAME="17"></A>did nothing (with a purpose), and had no need to do anything.  (Those who) 
<A NAME="18"></A>possessed them in a lower degree were (always) doing, and had need to be 
<A NAME="19"></A>so doing.
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> (Those who) possessed the highest benevolence were (always 
<A NAME="21"></A>seeking) to carry it out, and had no need to be doing so.  (Those who) 
<A NAME="22"></A>possessed the highest righteousness were (always seeking) to carry it out, 
<A NAME="23"></A>and had need to be so doing.
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> (Those who) possessed the highest (sense of) propriety 
<A NAME="25"></A>were (always seeking) to show it, and when men did not respond to it, they 
<A NAME="26"></A>bared the arm and marched up to them.
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR><B>5.</B> Thus it was that when the Tao was lost, its attributes 
<A NAME="28"></A>appeared; when its attributes were lost, benevolence appeared; when benevolence 
<A NAME="29"></A>was lost, righteousness appeared; and when righteousness was lost, the 
<A NAME="30"></A>proprieties appeared.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR><B>6.</B> Now propriety is the attenuated form of leal-heartedness 
<A NAME="32"></A>and good faith, and is also the commencement of disorder; swift apprehension 
<A NAME="33"></A>is (only) a flower of the Tao, and is the beginning of 
<A NAME="34"></A>stupidity.
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR><B>7.</B> Thus it is that the Great man abides by what is solid, 
<A NAME="36"></A>and eschews what is flimsy; dwells with the fruit and not with the flower. 
<A NAME="37"></A> It is thus that he puts away the one and makes choice of the 
<A NAME="38"></A>other.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="39"></A><B>Chapter 39</B>

<A NAME="40"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> The things which from of old have got the One (the Tao) 
<A NAME="41"></A>are--
<A NAME="42"></A><BR><BR>Heaven which by it is bright and pure;
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>Earth rendered thereby firm and sure;
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>Spirits with powers by it supplied;
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>Valleys kept full throughout their void
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>All creatures which through it do live
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>Princes and kings who from it get
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>The model which to all they give. All these are the results of the 
<A NAME="49"></A>One (Tao).
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> If heaven were not thus pure, it soon would 
<A NAME="51"></A>rend;
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>If earth were not thus sure, 'twould break and bend;
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>Without these powers, the spirits soon would fail;
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>If not so filled, the drought would parch each vale;
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>Without that life, creatures would pass away;
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>Princes and kings, without that moral sway,
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>However grand and high, would all decay.
<A NAME="58"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> Thus it is that dignity finds its (firm) root in its 
<A NAME="59"></A>(previous) meanness, and what is lofty finds its stability in the lowness 
<A NAME="60"></A>(from which it rises).  Hence princes and kings call themselves 'Orphans,' 
<A NAME="61"></A>'Men of small virtue,' and as 'Carriages without a nave.'  Is not this 
<A NAME="62"></A>an acknowledgment that in their considering themselves mean they see the 
<A NAME="63"></A>foundation of their dignity?  So it is that in the enumeration of the different 
<A NAME="64"></A>parts of a carriage we do not come on what makes it answer the ends of 
<A NAME="65"></A>a carriage.  They do not wish to show themselves elegant-looking as jade, 
<A NAME="66"></A>but (prefer) to be coarse-looking as an (ordinary) stone.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="67"></A><B>Chapter 40</B>

<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> The movement of the Tao
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>By contraries proceeds;
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>And weakness marks the course
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>Of Tao's mighty deeds.
<A NAME="72"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> All things under heaven sprang from It as existing (and 
<A NAME="73"></A>named); that existence sprang from It as non-existent (and not 
<A NAME="74"></A>named).
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="75"></A><B>Chapter 41</B>

<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> Scholars of the highest class, when they hear about the 
<A NAME="77"></A>Tao, earnestly carry it into practice.  Scholars of the middle class, when 
<A NAME="78"></A>they have heard about it, seem now to keep it and now to lose it. Scholars 
<A NAME="79"></A>of the lowest class, when they have heard about it, laugh greatly at it. 
<A NAME="80"></A> If it were not (thus) laughed at, it would not be fit to be the 
<A NAME="81"></A>Tao.
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> Therefore the sentence-makers have thus expressed 
<A NAME="83"></A>themselves:--
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><BR>'The Tao, when brightest seen, seems light to 
<A NAME="85"></A>lack;
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>Who progress in it makes, seems drawing back;
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>Its even way is like a rugged track.
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>Its highest virtue from the vale doth rise;
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>Its greatest beauty seems to offend the eyes;
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>And he has most whose lot the least supplies.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>Its firmest virtue seems but poor and low;
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>Its solid truth seems change to undergo;
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>Its largest square doth yet no corner show
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>A vessel great, it is the slowest made;
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>Loud is its sound, but never word it said;
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>A semblance great, the shadow of a shade.'
<A NAME="97"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> The Tao is hidden, and has no name; but it is the Tao 
<A NAME="98"></A>which is skilful at imparting (to all things what they need) and making 
<A NAME="99"></A>them complete.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="100"></A><B>Chapter 42</B>

<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> The Tao produced One; One produced Two; Two produced 
<A NAME="102"></A>Three; Three produced All things.  All things leave behind them the Obscurity 
<A NAME="103"></A>(out of which they have come), and go forward to embrace the Brightness 
<A NAME="104"></A>(into which they have emerged), while they are harmonised by the Breath 
<A NAME="105"></A>of Vacancy.
<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> What men dislike is to be orphans, to have little virtue, 
<A NAME="107"></A>to be as carriages without naves; and yet these are the designations which 
<A NAME="108"></A>kings and princes use for themselves.  So it is that some things are increased 
<A NAME="109"></A>by being diminished, and others are diminished by being 
<A NAME="110"></A>increased.
<A NAME="111"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> What other men (thus) teach, I also teach.  The violent 
<A NAME="112"></A>and strong do not die their natural death.  I will make this the basis 
<A NAME="113"></A>of my teaching.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="114"></A><B>Chapter 43</B>

<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> The softest thing in the world dashes against and overcomes 
<A NAME="116"></A>the hardest; that which has no (substantial) existence enters where there 
<A NAME="117"></A>is no crevice.  I know hereby what advantage belongs to doing nothing (with 
<A NAME="118"></A>a purpose).
<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> There are few in the world who attain to the teaching 
<A NAME="120"></A>without words, and the advantage arising from non-action.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="121"></A><B>Chapter 44</B>

<A NAME="122"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> Or fame or life,
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>Which do you hold more dear?
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>Or life or wealth,
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>To which would you adhere?
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>Keep life and lose those other things;
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>Keep them and lose your life:--which brings
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>Sorrow and pain more near?
<A NAME="129"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> Thus we may see,
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>Who cleaves to fame
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>Rejects what is more great;
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>Who loves large stores
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>Gives up the richer state.
<A NAME="134"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> Who is content
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>Needs fear no shame.
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>Who knows to stop
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>Incurs no blame.
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>From danger free
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>Long live shall he.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="140"></A><B>Chapter 45</B>

<A NAME="141"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> Who thinks his great achievements 
<A NAME="142"></A>poor
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>Shall find his vigour long endure.
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>Of greatest fulness, deemed a void,
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>Exhaustion ne'er shall stem the tide.
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>Do thou what's straight still crooked deem;
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>Thy greatest art still stupid seem,
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>And eloquence a stammering scream.
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> Constant action overcomes cold; being still overcomes 
<A NAME="150"></A>heat.  Purity and stillness give the correct law to all under 
<A NAME="151"></A>heaven.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="152"></A><B>Chapter 46</B>

<A NAME="153"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> When the Tao prevails in the world, they send back their 
<A NAME="154"></A>swift horses to (draw) the dung-carts.  When the Tao is disregarded in 
<A NAME="155"></A>the world, the war-horses breed in the border lands.
<A NAME="156"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> There is no guilt greater than to sanction ambition; 
<A NAME="157"></A>no calamity greater than to be discontented with one's lot; no fault greater 
<A NAME="158"></A>than the wish to be getting.  Therefore the sufficiency of contentment 
<A NAME="159"></A>is an enduring and unchanging sufficiency.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="160"></A><B>Chapter 47</B>

<A NAME="161"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> Without going outside his door, one understands (all 
<A NAME="162"></A>that takes place) under the sky; without looking out from his window, one 
<A NAME="163"></A>sees the Tao of Heaven.  The farther that one goes out (from himself), 
<A NAME="164"></A>the less he knows.
<A NAME="165"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> Therefore the sages got their knowledge without travelling; 
<A NAME="166"></A>gave their (right) names to things without seeing them; and accomplished 
<A NAME="167"></A>their ends without any purpose of doing so.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="168"></A><B>Chapter 48</B>

<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> He who devotes himself to learning (seeks) from day to 
<A NAME="170"></A>day to increase (his knowledge); he who devotes himself to the Tao (seeks) 
<A NAME="171"></A>from day to day to diminish (his doing).
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> He diminishes it and again diminishes it, till he arrives 
<A NAME="173"></A>at doing nothing (on purpose).  Having arrived at this point of non-action, 
<A NAME="174"></A>there is nothing which he does not do.
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> He who gets as his own all under heaven does so by giving 
<A NAME="176"></A>himself no trouble (with that end).  If one take trouble (with that end), 
<A NAME="177"></A>he is not equal to getting as his own all under heaven.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="178"></A><B>Chapter 49</B>

<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> The sage has no invariable mind of his own; he makes 
<A NAME="180"></A>the mind of the people his mind.
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> To those who are good (to me), I am good; and to those 
<A NAME="182"></A>who are not good (to me), I am also good;--and thus (all) get to be good. 
<A NAME="183"></A> To those who are sincere (with me), I am sincere; and to those who are 
<A NAME="184"></A>not sincere (with me), I am also sincere;--and thus (all) get to be 
<A NAME="185"></A>sincere.
<A NAME="186"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> The sage has in the world an appearance of indecision, 
<A NAME="187"></A>and keeps his mind in a state of indifference to all.  The people all keep 
<A NAME="188"></A>their eyes and ears directed to him, and he deals with them all as his 
<A NAME="189"></A>children.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="190"></A><B>Chapter 50</B>

<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> Men come forth and live; they enter (again) and 
<A NAME="192"></A>die.
<A NAME="193"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> Of every ten three are ministers of life (to themselves); 
<A NAME="194"></A>and three are ministers of death.
<A NAME="195"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> There are also three in every ten whose aim is to live, 
<A NAME="196"></A>but whose movements tend to the land (or place) of death.  And for what 
<A NAME="197"></A>reason? Because of their excessive endeavours to perpetuate 
<A NAME="198"></A>life.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> But I have heard that he who is skilful in managing the 
<A NAME="200"></A>life entrusted to him for a time travels on the land without having to 
<A NAME="201"></A>shun rhinoceros or tiger, and enters a host without having to avoid buff 
<A NAME="202"></A>coat or sharp weapon.  The rhinoceros finds no place in him into which 
<A NAME="203"></A>to thrust its horn, nor the tiger a place in which to fix its claws, nor 
<A NAME="204"></A>the weapon a place to admit its point.  And for what reason? Because there 
<A NAME="205"></A>is in him no place of death.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="206"></A><B>Chapter 51</B>

<A NAME="207"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> All things are produced by the Tao, and nourished by 
<A NAME="208"></A>its outflowing operation.  They receive their forms according to the nature 
<A NAME="209"></A>of each, and are completed according to the circumstances of their condition. 
<A NAME="210"></A> Therefore all things without exception honour the Tao, and exalt its outflowing 
<A NAME="211"></A>operation.
<A NAME="212"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> This honouring of the Tao and exalting of its operation 
<A NAME="213"></A>is not the result of any ordination, but always a spontaneous 
<A NAME="214"></A>tribute.
<A NAME="215"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> Thus it is that the Tao produces (all things), nourishes 
<A NAME="216"></A>them, brings them to their full growth, nurses them, completes them, matures 
<A NAME="217"></A>them, maintains them, and overspreads them.
<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> It produces them and makes no claim to the possession 
<A NAME="219"></A>of them; it carries them through their processes and does not vaunt its 
<A NAME="220"></A>ability in doing so; it brings them to maturity and exercises no control 
<A NAME="221"></A>over them;--this is called its mysterious operation.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="222"></A><B>Chapter 52</B>

<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> (The Tao) which originated all under the sky is to be 
<A NAME="224"></A>considered as the mother of them all.
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> When the mother is found, we know what her children should 
<A NAME="226"></A>be. When one knows that he is his mother's child, and proceeds to guard 
<A NAME="227"></A>(the qualities of) the mother that belong to him, to the end of his life 
<A NAME="228"></A>he will be free from all peril.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> Let him keep his mouth closed, and shut up the portals 
<A NAME="230"></A>(of his nostrils), and all his life he will be exempt from laborious exertion. 
<A NAME="231"></A>Let him keep his mouth open, and (spend his breath) in the promotion of 
<A NAME="232"></A>his affairs, and all his life there will be no safety for 
<A NAME="233"></A>him.
<A NAME="234"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> The perception of what is small is (the secret of clear- 
<A NAME="235"></A>sightedness; the guarding of what is soft and tender is (the secret of) 
<A NAME="236"></A>strength.
<A NAME="237"></A><BR><BR><B>5.</B> Who uses well his light,
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>Reverting to its (source so) bright,
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>Will from his body ward all blight,
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>And hides the unchanging from men's sight.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="241"></A><B>Chapter 53</B>

<A NAME="242"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> If I were suddenly to become known, and (put into a position 
<A NAME="243"></A>to) conduct (a government) according to the Great Tao, what I should be 
<A NAME="244"></A>most afraid of would be a boastful display.
<A NAME="245"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> The great Tao (or way) is very level and easy; but people 
<A NAME="246"></A>love the by-ways.
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> Their court(-yards and buildings) shall be well kept, 
<A NAME="248"></A>but their fields shall be ill-cultivated, and their granaries very empty. 
<A NAME="249"></A> They shall wear elegant and ornamented robes, carry a sharp sword at their 
<A NAME="250"></A>girdle, pamper themselves in eating and drinking, and have a superabundance 
<A NAME="251"></A>of property and wealth;--such (princes) may be called robbers and boasters. 
<A NAME="252"></A> This is contrary to the Tao surely!
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="253"></A><B>Chapter 54</B>

<A NAME="254"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> What (Tao's) skilful planter plants
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>Can never be uptorn;
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>What his skilful arms enfold,
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>From him can ne'er be borne.
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>Sons shall bring in lengthening line,
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>Sacrifices to his shrine.
<A NAME="260"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> Tao when nursed within one's self,
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>His vigour will make true;
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>And where the family it rules
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>What riches will accrue!
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>The neighbourhood where it prevails
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>In thriving will abound;
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>And when 'tis seen throughout the state,
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>Good fortune will be found.
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>Employ it the kingdom o'er,
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>And men thrive all around.
<A NAME="270"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> In this way the effect will be seen in the person, by 
<A NAME="271"></A>the observation of different cases; in the family; in the neighbourhood; 
<A NAME="272"></A>in the state; and in the kingdom.
<A NAME="273"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> How do I know that this effect is sure to hold thus all 
<A NAME="274"></A>under the sky?  By this (method of observation).
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="275"></A><B>Chapter 55</B>

<A NAME="276"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> He who has in himself abundantly the attributes (of the 
<A NAME="277"></A>Tao) is like an infant.  Poisonous insects will not sting him; fierce beasts 
<A NAME="278"></A>will not seize him; birds of prey will not strike him.
<A NAME="279"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> (The infant's) bones are weak and its sinews soft, but 
<A NAME="280"></A>yet its grasp is firm.  It knows not yet the union of male and female, 
<A NAME="281"></A>and yet its virile member may be excited;--showing the perfection of its 
<A NAME="282"></A>physical essence.  All day long it will cry without its throat becoming 
<A NAME="283"></A>hoarse;--showing the harmony (in its constitution).
<A NAME="284"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> To him by whom this harmony is known,
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>(The secret of) the unchanging (Tao) is shown,
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>And in the knowledge wisdom finds its throne.
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>All life-increasing arts to evil turn;
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>Where the mind makes the vital breath to burn,
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>(False) is the strength, (and o'er it we should 
<A NAME="290"></A>mourn.)
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> When things have become strong, they (then) become old, 
<A NAME="292"></A>which may be said to be contrary to the Tao.  Whatever is  contrary to 
<A NAME="293"></A>the Tao soon ends.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="294"></A><B>Chapter 56</B>

<A NAME="295"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> He who knows (the Tao) does not (care to) speak (about 
<A NAME="296"></A>it); he who is (ever ready to) speak about it does not know 
<A NAME="297"></A>it.
<A NAME="298"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> He (who knows it) will keep his mouth shut and close 
<A NAME="299"></A>the portals (of his nostrils).  He will blunt his sharp points and unravel 
<A NAME="300"></A>the complications of things; he will attemper his brightness, and bring 
<A NAME="301"></A>himself into agreement with the obscurity (of others).  This is called 
<A NAME="302"></A>'the Mysterious Agreement.'
<A NAME="303"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> (Such an one) cannot be treated familiarly or distantly; 
<A NAME="304"></A>he is beyond all consideration of profit or injury; of nobility or meanness:--he 
<A NAME="305"></A>is the noblest man under heaven.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="306"></A><B>Chapter 57</B>

<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> A state may be ruled by (measures of) correction; weapons 
<A NAME="308"></A>of war may be used with crafty dexterity; (but) the kingdom is made one's 
<A NAME="309"></A>own (only) by freedom from action and purpose.
<A NAME="310"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> How do I know that it is so?  By these facts:--In the 
<A NAME="311"></A>kingdom the multiplication of prohibitive enactments increases the poverty 
<A NAME="312"></A>of the people; the more implements to add to their profit that the people 
<A NAME="313"></A>have, the greater disorder is there in the state and clan; the more acts 
<A NAME="314"></A>of crafty dexterity that men possess, the more do strange contrivances 
<A NAME="315"></A>appear; the more display there is of legislation, the more thieves and 
<A NAME="316"></A>robbers there are.
<A NAME="317"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> Therefore a sage has said, 'I will do nothing (of purpose), 
<A NAME="318"></A>and the people will be transformed of themselves; I will be fond of keeping 
<A NAME="319"></A>still, and the people will of themselves become correct.  I will take no 
<A NAME="320"></A>trouble about it, and the people will of themselves become rich; I will 
<A NAME="321"></A>manifest no ambition, and the people will of themselves attain to the primitive 
<A NAME="322"></A>simplicity.'
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="323"></A><B>Chapter 58</B>

<A NAME="324"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> The government that seems the most 
<A NAME="325"></A>unwise,
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>Oft goodness to the people best supplies;
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>That which is meddling, touching everything,
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>Will work but ill, and disappointment bring. Misery!--happiness is 
<A NAME="329"></A>to be found by its side!  Happiness!--misery lurks beneath it!  Who knows 
<A NAME="330"></A>what either will come to in the end?
<A NAME="331"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> Shall we then dispense with correction?  The (method 
<A NAME="332"></A>of) correction shall by a turn become distortion, and the good in it shall 
<A NAME="333"></A>by a turn become evil.  The delusion of the people (on this point) has 
<A NAME="334"></A>indeed subsisted for a long time.
<A NAME="335"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> Therefore the sage is (like) a square which cuts no one 
<A NAME="336"></A>(with its angles); (like) a corner which injures no one (with its sharpness). 
<A NAME="337"></A>He is straightforward, but allows himself no license; he is bright, but 
<A NAME="338"></A>does not dazzle.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="339"></A><B>Chapter 59</B>

<A NAME="340"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> For regulating the human (in our constitution) and rendering 
<A NAME="341"></A>the (proper) service to the heavenly, there is nothing like 
<A NAME="342"></A>moderation.
<A NAME="343"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> It is only by this moderation that there is effected 
<A NAME="344"></A>an early return (to man's normal state).  That early return is what I call 
<A NAME="345"></A>the repeated accumulation of the attributes (of the Tao).  With that repeated 
<A NAME="346"></A>accumulation of those attributes, there comes the subjugation (of every 
<A NAME="347"></A>obstacle to such return).  Of this subjugation we know not what shall be 
<A NAME="348"></A>the limit; and when one knows not what the limit shall be, he may be the 
<A NAME="349"></A>ruler of a state.
<A NAME="350"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> He who possesses the mother of the state may continue 
<A NAME="351"></A>long.  His case is like that (of the plant) of which we say that its roots 
<A NAME="352"></A>are deep and its flower stalks firm:--this is the way to secure that its 
<A NAME="353"></A>enduring life shall long be seen.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="354"></A><B>Chapter 60</B>

<A NAME="355"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> Governing a great state is like cooking small 
<A NAME="356"></A>fish.
<A NAME="357"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> Let the kingdom be governed according to the Tao, and 
<A NAME="358"></A>the manes of the departed will not manifest their spiritual energy.  It 
<A NAME="359"></A>is not that those manes have not that spiritual energy, but it will not 
<A NAME="360"></A>be employed to hurt men.  It is not that it could not hurt men, but neither 
<A NAME="361"></A>does the ruling sage hurt them.
<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> When these two do not injuriously affect each other, 
<A NAME="363"></A>their good influences converge in the virtue (of the 
<A NAME="364"></A>Tao).
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="365"></A><B>Chapter 61</B>

<A NAME="366"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> What makes a great state is its being (like) a low-lying, 
<A NAME="367"></A>down- flowing (stream);--it becomes the centre to which tend (all the small 
<A NAME="368"></A>states) under heaven.
<A NAME="369"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> (To illustrate from) the case of all females:--the female 
<A NAME="370"></A>always overcomes the male by her stillness.  Stillness may be considered 
<A NAME="371"></A>(a sort of) abasement.
<A NAME="372"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> Thus it is that a great state, by condescending to small 
<A NAME="373"></A>states, gains them for itself; and that small states, by abasing themselves 
<A NAME="374"></A>to a great state, win it over to them.  In the one case the abasement leads 
<A NAME="375"></A>to gaining adherents, in the other case to procuring 
<A NAME="376"></A>favour.
<A NAME="377"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> The great state only wishes to unite men together and 
<A NAME="378"></A>nourish them; a small state only wishes to be received by, and to serve, 
<A NAME="379"></A>the other. Each gets what it desires, but the great state must learn to 
<A NAME="380"></A>abase itself.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="381"></A><B>Chapter 62</B>

<A NAME="382"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> Tao has of all things the most honoured 
<A NAME="383"></A>place.
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>No treasures give good men so rich a grace;
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>Bad men it guards, and doth their ill efface.
<A NAME="386"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> (Its) admirable words can purchase honour; (its) admirable 
<A NAME="387"></A>deeds can raise their performer above others.  Even men who are not good 
<A NAME="388"></A>are not abandoned by it.
<A NAME="389"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> Therefore when the sovereign occupies his place as the 
<A NAME="390"></A>Son of Heaven, and he has appointed his three ducal ministers, though (a 
<A NAME="391"></A>prince) were to send in a round symbol-of-rank large enough to fill both 
<A NAME="392"></A>the hands, and that as the precursor of the team of horses (in the court-yard), 
<A NAME="393"></A>such an offering would not be equal to (a lesson of) this Tao, which one 
<A NAME="394"></A>might present on his knees.
<A NAME="395"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> Why was it that the ancients prized this Tao so much? 
<A NAME="396"></A> Was it not because it could be got by seeking for it, and the guilty could 
<A NAME="397"></A>escape (from the stain of their guilt) by it?  This is the reason why all 
<A NAME="398"></A>under heaven consider it the most valuable thing.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="399"></A><B>Chapter 63</B>

<A NAME="400"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> (It is the way of the Tao) to act without (thinking of) 
<A NAME="401"></A>acting; to conduct affairs without (feeling the) trouble of them; to taste 
<A NAME="402"></A>without discerning any flavour; to consider what is small as great, and 
<A NAME="403"></A>a few as many; and to recompense injury with kindness.
<A NAME="404"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> (The master of it) anticipates things that are difficult 
<A NAME="405"></A>while they are easy, and does things that would become great while they 
<A NAME="406"></A>are small.  All difficult things in the world are sure to arise from a 
<A NAME="407"></A>previous state in which they were easy, and all great things from one in 
<A NAME="408"></A>which they were small.  Therefore the sage, while he never does what is 
<A NAME="409"></A>great, is able on that account to accomplish the greatest 
<A NAME="410"></A>things.
<A NAME="411"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> He who lightly promises is sure to keep but little faith; 
<A NAME="412"></A>he who is continually thinking things easy is sure to find them difficult. 
<A NAME="413"></A>Therefore the sage sees difficulty even in what seems easy, and so never 
<A NAME="414"></A>has any difficulties.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="415"></A><B>Chapter 64</B>

<A NAME="416"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> That which is at rest is easily kept hold of; before 
<A NAME="417"></A>a thing has given indications of its presence, it is easy to take measures 
<A NAME="418"></A>against it; that which is brittle is easily broken; that which is very 
<A NAME="419"></A>small is easily dispersed.  Action should be taken before a thing has made 
<A NAME="420"></A>its appearance; order should be secured before disorder has 
<A NAME="421"></A>begun.
<A NAME="422"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> The tree which fills the arms grew from the tiniest sprout; 
<A NAME="423"></A>the tower of nine storeys rose from a (small) heap of earth; the journey 
<A NAME="424"></A>of a thousand li commenced with a single step.
<A NAME="425"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> He who acts (with an ulterior purpose) does harm; he 
<A NAME="426"></A>who takes hold of a thing (in the same way) loses his hold.  The sage does 
<A NAME="427"></A>not act (so), and therefore does no harm; he does not lay hold (so), and 
<A NAME="428"></A>therefore does not lose his bold.  (But) people in their conduct of affairs 
<A NAME="429"></A>are constantly ruining them when they are on the eve of success.  If they 
<A NAME="430"></A>were careful at the end, as (they should be) at the beginning, they would 
<A NAME="431"></A>not so ruin them.
<A NAME="432"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> Therefore the sage desires what (other men) do not desire, 
<A NAME="433"></A>and does not prize things difficult to get; he learns what (other men) 
<A NAME="434"></A>do not learn, and turns back to what the multitude of men have passed by. 
<A NAME="435"></A>Thus he helps the natural development of all things, and does not dare 
<A NAME="436"></A>to act (with an ulterior purpose of his own).
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="437"></A><B>Chapter 65</B>

<A NAME="438"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> The ancients who showed their skill in practising the 
<A NAME="439"></A>Tao did so, not to enlighten the people, but rather to make them simple 
<A NAME="440"></A>and ignorant.
<A NAME="441"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> The difficulty in governing the people arises from their 
<A NAME="442"></A>having much knowledge.  He who (tries to) govern a state by his wisdom 
<A NAME="443"></A>is a scourge to it; while he who does not (try to) do so is a 
<A NAME="444"></A>blessing.
<A NAME="445"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> He who knows these two things finds in them also his 
<A NAME="446"></A>model and rule.  Ability to know this model and rule constitutes what we 
<A NAME="447"></A>call the mysterious excellence (of a governor).  Deep and far-reaching 
<A NAME="448"></A>is such mysterious excellence, showing indeed its possessor as opposite 
<A NAME="449"></A>to others, but leading them to a great conformity to 
<A NAME="450"></A>him.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="451"></A><B>Chapter 66</B>

<A NAME="452"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> That whereby the rivers and seas are able to receive 
<A NAME="453"></A>the homage and tribute of all the valley streams, is their skill in being 
<A NAME="454"></A>lower than they;--it is thus that they are the kings of them all.  So it 
<A NAME="455"></A>is that the sage (ruler), wishing to be above men, puts himself by his 
<A NAME="456"></A>words below them, and, wishing to be before them, places his person behind 
<A NAME="457"></A>them.
<A NAME="458"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> In this way though he has his place above them, men do 
<A NAME="459"></A>not feel his weight, nor though he has his place before them, do they feel 
<A NAME="460"></A>it an injury to them.
<A NAME="461"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> Therefore all in the world delight to exalt him and do 
<A NAME="462"></A>not weary of him.  Because he does not strive, no one finds it possible 
<A NAME="463"></A>to strive with him.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="464"></A><B>Chapter 67</B>

<A NAME="465"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> All the world says that, while my Tao is great, it yet 
<A NAME="466"></A>appears to be inferior (to other systems of teaching).   Now it is just 
<A NAME="467"></A>its greatness that makes it seem to be inferior.  If it were like any other 
<A NAME="468"></A>(system), for long would its smallness have been known!
<A NAME="469"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> But I have three precious things which I prize and hold 
<A NAME="470"></A>fast.  The first is gentleness; the second is economy; and the third is 
<A NAME="471"></A>shrinking from taking precedence of others.
<A NAME="472"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> With that gentleness I can be bold; with that economy 
<A NAME="473"></A>I can be liberal; shrinking from taking precedence of others, I can become 
<A NAME="474"></A>a vessel of the highest honour.  Now-a-days they give up gentleness and 
<A NAME="475"></A>are all for being bold; economy, and are all for being liberal; the hindmost 
<A NAME="476"></A>place, and seek only to be foremost;--(of all which the end is) 
<A NAME="477"></A>death.
<A NAME="478"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> Gentleness is sure to be victorious even in battle, and 
<A NAME="479"></A>firmly to maintain its ground.  Heaven will save its possessor, by his 
<A NAME="480"></A>(very) gentleness protecting him.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="481"></A><B>Chapter 68</B>

<A NAME="482"></A><BR><BR>He who in (Tao's) wars has skill
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>Assumes no martial port;
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>He who fights with most good will
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>To rage makes no resort.
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>He who vanquishes yet still
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>Keeps from his foes apart;
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>He whose hests men most fulfil
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>Yet humbly plies his art.
<A NAME="490"></A><BR><BR>Thus we say, 'He ne'er contends,
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>And therein is his might.'
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>Thus we say, 'Men's wills he bends,
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>That they with him unite.'
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>Thus we say, 'Like Heaven's his ends,
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>No sage of old more bright.'
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="496"></A><B>Chapter 69</B>

<A NAME="497"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> A master of the art of war has said, 'I do not dare to 
<A NAME="498"></A>be the host (to commence the war); I prefer to be the guest (to act on 
<A NAME="499"></A>the defensive).  I do not dare to advance an inch; I prefer to retire a 
<A NAME="500"></A>foot.'  This is called marshalling the ranks where there are no ranks; 
<A NAME="501"></A>baring the arms (to fight) where there are no arms to bare; grasping the 
<A NAME="502"></A>weapon where there is no weapon to grasp; advancing against the enemy where 
<A NAME="503"></A>there is no enemy.
<A NAME="504"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> There is no calamity greater than lightly engaging in 
<A NAME="505"></A>war.  To do that is near losing (the gentleness) which is so precious. 
<A NAME="506"></A> Thus it is that when opposing weapons are (actually) crossed, he who deplores 
<A NAME="507"></A>(the situation) conquers.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="508"></A><B>Chapter 70</B>

<A NAME="509"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> My words are very easy to know, and very easy to practise; 
<A NAME="510"></A>but there is no one in the world who is able to know and able to practise 
<A NAME="511"></A>them.
<A NAME="512"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> There is an originating and all-comprehending (principle) 
<A NAME="513"></A>in my words, and an authoritative law for the things (which I enforce). 
<A NAME="514"></A> It is because they do not know these, that men do not know 
<A NAME="515"></A>me.
<A NAME="516"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> They who know me are few, and I am on that account (the 
<A NAME="517"></A>more) to be prized.  It is thus that the sage wears (a poor garb of) hair 
<A NAME="518"></A>cloth, while he carries his (signet of) jade in his 
<A NAME="519"></A>bosom.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="520"></A><B>Chapter 71</B>

<A NAME="521"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> To know and yet (think) we do not know is the highest 
<A NAME="522"></A>(attainment); not to know (and yet think) we do know is a 
<A NAME="523"></A>disease.
<A NAME="524"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> It is simply by being pained at (the thought of) having 
<A NAME="525"></A>this disease that we are preserved from it.  The sage has not the disease. 
<A NAME="526"></A>He knows the pain that would be inseparable from it, and therefore he does 
<A NAME="527"></A>not have it.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="528"></A><B>Chapter 72</B>

<A NAME="529"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> When the people do not fear what they ought to fear, 
<A NAME="530"></A>that which is their great dread will come on them.
<A NAME="531"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> Let them not thoughtlessly indulge themselves in their 
<A NAME="532"></A>ordinary life; let them not act as if weary of what that life depends 
<A NAME="533"></A>on.
<A NAME="534"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> It is by avoiding such indulgence that such weariness 
<A NAME="535"></A>does not arise.
<A NAME="536"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> Therefore the sage knows (these things) of himself, but 
<A NAME="537"></A>does not parade (his knowledge); loves, but does not (appear to set a) 
<A NAME="538"></A>value on, himself.  And thus he puts the latter alternative away and makes 
<A NAME="539"></A>choice of the former.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="540"></A><B>Chapter 73</B>

<A NAME="541"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> He whose boldness appears in his daring (to do wrong, 
<A NAME="542"></A>in defiance of the laws) is put to death; he whose boldness appears in 
<A NAME="543"></A>his not daring (to do so) lives on.  Of these two cases the one appears 
<A NAME="544"></A>to be advantageous, and the other to be injurious.  But
<A NAME="545"></A><BR><BR>When Heaven's anger smites a man,
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>Who the cause shall truly scan? On this account the sage feels a difficulty 
<A NAME="547"></A>(as to what to do in the former case).
<A NAME="548"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> It is the way of Heaven not to strive, and yet it skilfully 
<A NAME="549"></A>overcomes; not to speak, and yet it is skilful in (obtaining a reply; does 
<A NAME="550"></A>not call, and yet men come to it of themselves.  Its demonstrations are 
<A NAME="551"></A>quiet, and yet its plans are skilful and effective. The meshes of the net 
<A NAME="552"></A>of Heaven are large; far apart, but letting nothing 
<A NAME="553"></A>escape.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="554"></A><B>Chapter 74</B>

<A NAME="555"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> The people do not fear death; to what purpose is it to 
<A NAME="556"></A>(try to) frighten them with death?  If the people were always in awe of 
<A NAME="557"></A>death, and I could always seize those who do wrong, and put them to death, 
<A NAME="558"></A>who would dare to do wrong?
<A NAME="559"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> There is always One who presides over the infliction 
<A NAME="560"></A>death.  He who would inflict death in the room of him who so presides over 
<A NAME="561"></A>it may be described as hewing wood instead of a great carpenter.  Seldom 
<A NAME="562"></A>is it that he who undertakes the hewing, instead of the great carpenter, 
<A NAME="563"></A>does not cut his own hands!
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="564"></A><B>Chapter 75</B>

<A NAME="565"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> The people suffer from famine because of the multitude 
<A NAME="566"></A>of taxes consumed by their superiors.  It is through this that they suffer 
<A NAME="567"></A>famine.
<A NAME="568"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> The people are difficult to govern because of the (excessive) 
<A NAME="569"></A>agency of their superiors (in governing them).  It is through this that 
<A NAME="570"></A>they are difficult to govern.
<A NAME="571"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> The people make light of dying because of the greatness 
<A NAME="572"></A>of their labours in seeking for the means of living.  It is this which 
<A NAME="573"></A>makes them think light of dying.  Thus it is that to leave the subject 
<A NAME="574"></A>of living altogether out of view is better than to set a high value on 
<A NAME="575"></A>it.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="576"></A><B>Chapter 76</B>

<A NAME="577"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> Man at his birth is supple and weak; at his death, firm 
<A NAME="578"></A>and strong.  (So it is with) all things.  Trees and plants, in their early 
<A NAME="579"></A>growth, are soft and brittle; at their death, dry and 
<A NAME="580"></A>withered.
<A NAME="581"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> Thus it is that firmness and strength are the concomitants 
<A NAME="582"></A>of death; softness and weakness, the concomitants of 
<A NAME="583"></A>life.
<A NAME="584"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> Hence he who (relies on) the strength of his forces does 
<A NAME="585"></A>not conquer; and a tree which is strong will fill the out-stretched arms, 
<A NAME="586"></A>(and thereby invites the feller.)
<A NAME="587"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> Therefore the place of what is firm and strong is below, 
<A NAME="588"></A>and that of what is soft and weak is above.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="589"></A><B>Chapter 77</B>

<A NAME="590"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> May not the Way (or Tao) of Heaven be compared to the 
<A NAME="591"></A>(method of) bending a bow?  The (part of the bow) which was high is brought 
<A NAME="592"></A>low, and what was low is raised up.  (So Heaven) diminishes where there 
<A NAME="593"></A>is superabundance, and supplements where there is deficiency.
<A NAME="594"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> It is the Way of Heaven to diminish superabundance, and 
<A NAME="595"></A>to supplement deficiency.  It is not so with the way of man.  He takes 
<A NAME="596"></A>away from those who have not enough to add to his own 
<A NAME="597"></A>superabundance.
<A NAME="598"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> Who can take his own superabundance and therewith serve 
<A NAME="599"></A>all under heaven?  Only he who is in possession of the 
<A NAME="600"></A>Tao!
<A NAME="601"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> Therefore the (ruling) sage acts without claiming the 
<A NAME="602"></A>results as his; he achieves his merit and does not rest (arrogantly) in 
<A NAME="603"></A>it:--he does not wish to display his superiority.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="604"></A><B>Chapter 78</B>

<A NAME="605"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> There is nothing in the world more soft and weak than 
<A NAME="606"></A>water, and yet for attacking things that are firm and strong there is nothing 
<A NAME="607"></A>that can take precedence of it;--for there is nothing (so effectual) for 
<A NAME="608"></A>which it can be changed.
<A NAME="609"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> Every one in the world knows that the soft overcomes 
<A NAME="610"></A>the hard, and the weak the strong, but no one is able to carry it out in 
<A NAME="611"></A>practice.
<A NAME="612"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> Therefore a sage has said,
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>'He who accepts his state's reproach,
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>Is hailed therefore its altars' lord;
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>To him who bears men's direful woes
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>They all the name of King accord.'
<A NAME="617"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> Words that are strictly true seem to be 
<A NAME="618"></A>paradoxical.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="619"></A><B>Chapter 79</B>

<A NAME="620"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> When a reconciliation is effected (between two parties) 
<A NAME="621"></A>after a great animosity, there is sure to be a grudge remaining (in the 
<A NAME="622"></A>mind of the one who was wrong).  And how can this be beneficial (to the 
<A NAME="623"></A>other)?
<A NAME="624"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> Therefore (to guard against this), the sage keeps the 
<A NAME="625"></A>left-hand portion of the record of the engagement, and does not insist 
<A NAME="626"></A>on the (speedy) fulfilment of it by the other party.  (So), he who has 
<A NAME="627"></A>the attributes (of the Tao) regards (only) the conditions of the engagement, 
<A NAME="628"></A>while he who has not those attributes regards only the conditions favourable 
<A NAME="629"></A>to himself.
<A NAME="630"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> In the Way of Heaven, there is no partiality of love; 
<A NAME="631"></A>it is always on the side of the good man.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="632"></A><B>Chapter 80</B>

<A NAME="633"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> In a little state with a small population, I would so 
<A NAME="634"></A>order it, that, though there were individuals with the abilities of ten 
<A NAME="635"></A>or a hundred men, there should be no employment of them; I would make the 
<A NAME="636"></A>people, while looking on death as a grievous thing, yet not remove elsewhere 
<A NAME="637"></A>(to avoid it).
<A NAME="638"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> Though they had boats and carriages, they should have 
<A NAME="639"></A>no occasion to ride in them; though they had buff coats and sharp weapons, 
<A NAME="640"></A>they should have no occasion to don or use them.
<A NAME="641"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> I would make the people return to the use of knotted 
<A NAME="642"></A>cords (instead of the written characters).
<A NAME="643"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> They should think their (coarse) food sweet; their (plain) 
<A NAME="644"></A>clothes beautiful; their (poor) dwellings places of rest; and their common 
<A NAME="645"></A>(simple) ways sources of enjoyment.
<A NAME="646"></A><BR><BR><B>5.</B> There should be a neighbouring state within sight, and 
<A NAME="647"></A>the voices of the fowls and dogs should be heard all the way from it to 
<A NAME="648"></A>us, but I would make the people to old age, even to death, not have any 
<A NAME="649"></A>intercourse with it.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="650"></A><B>Chapter 81</B>

<A NAME="651"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> Sincere words are not fine; fine words are not sincere. 
<A NAME="652"></A> Those who are skilled (in the Tao) do not dispute (about it); the disputatious 
<A NAME="653"></A>are not skilled in it.  Those who know (the Tao) are not extensively learned; 
<A NAME="654"></A>the extensively learned do not know it.
<A NAME="655"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> The sage does not accumulate (for himself).  The more 
<A NAME="656"></A>that he expends for others, the more does he possess of his own; the more 
<A NAME="657"></A>that he gives to others, the more does he have himself.
<A NAME="658"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> With all the sharpness of the Way of Heaven, it injures 
<A NAME="659"></A>not; with all the doing in the way of the sage he does not 
<A NAME="660"></A>strive.
