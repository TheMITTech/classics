<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A><B>Chapter 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A><B>1.</B> The Tao that can be trodden is not the enduring and unchanging 
<A NAME="12"></A>Tao.  The name that can be named is not the enduring and unchanging 
<A NAME="13"></A>name.
<A NAME="14"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> (Conceived of as) having no name, it is the Originator 
<A NAME="15"></A>of heaven and earth; (conceived of as) having a name, it is the Mother 
<A NAME="16"></A>of all things.
<A NAME="17"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> Always without desire we must be found,
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>If its deep mystery we would sound;
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>But if desire always within us be,
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>Its outer fringe is all that we shall see.
<A NAME="21"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> Under these two aspects, it is really the same; but as 
<A NAME="22"></A>development takes place, it receives the different names.  Together we 
<A NAME="23"></A>call them the Mystery.  Where the Mystery is the deepest is the gate of 
<A NAME="24"></A>all that is subtle and wonderful.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="25"></A><B>Chapter 2</B>

<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> All in the world know the beauty of the beautiful, and 
<A NAME="27"></A>in doing this they have (the idea of) what ugliness is; they all know the 
<A NAME="28"></A>skill of the skilful, and in doing this they have (the idea of) what the 
<A NAME="29"></A>want of skill is.
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> So it is that existence and non-existence give birth 
<A NAME="31"></A>the one to (the idea of) the other; that difficulty and ease produce the 
<A NAME="32"></A>one (the idea of) the other; that length and shortness fashion out the 
<A NAME="33"></A>one the figure of the other; that (the ideas of) height and lowness arise 
<A NAME="34"></A>from the contrast of the one with the other; that the musical notes and 
<A NAME="35"></A>tones become harmonious through the relation of one with another; and that 
<A NAME="36"></A>being before and behind give the idea of one following 
<A NAME="37"></A>another.
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> Therefore the sage manages affairs without doing anything, 
<A NAME="39"></A>and conveys his instructions without the use of speech.
<A NAME="40"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> All things spring up, and there is not one which declines 
<A NAME="41"></A>to show itself; they grow, and there is no claim made for their ownership; 
<A NAME="42"></A>they go through their processes, and there is no expectation (of a reward 
<A NAME="43"></A>for the results).  The work is accomplished, and there is no resting in 
<A NAME="44"></A>it (as an achievement).
<A NAME="45"></A><BR><BR>The work is done, but how no one can see;
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>'Tis this that makes the power not cease to be.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="47"></A><B>Chapter 3</B>

<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> Not to value and employ men of superior ability is the 
<A NAME="49"></A>way to keep the people from rivalry among themselves; not to prize articles 
<A NAME="50"></A>which are difficult to procure is the way to keep them from becoming thieves; 
<A NAME="51"></A>not to show them what is likely to excite their desires is the way to keep 
<A NAME="52"></A>their minds from disorder.
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> Therefore the sage, in the exercise of his government, 
<A NAME="54"></A>empties their minds, fills their bellies, weakens their wills, and strengthens 
<A NAME="55"></A>their bones.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> He constantly (tries to) keep them without knowledge 
<A NAME="57"></A>and without desire, and where there are those who have knowledge, to keep 
<A NAME="58"></A>them from presuming to act (on it).  When there is this abstinence from 
<A NAME="59"></A>action, good order is universal.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="60"></A><B>Chapter 4</B>

<A NAME="61"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> The Tao is (like) the emptiness of a vessel; and in our 
<A NAME="62"></A>employment of it we must be on our guard against all fulness.  How deep 
<A NAME="63"></A>and unfathomable it is, as if it were the Honoured Ancestor of all 
<A NAME="64"></A>things!
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> We should blunt our sharp points, and unravel the complications 
<A NAME="66"></A>of things; we should attemper our brightness, and bring ourselves into 
<A NAME="67"></A>agreement with the obscurity of others.  How pure and still the Tao is, 
<A NAME="68"></A>as if it would ever so continue!
<A NAME="69"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> I do not know whose son it is.  It might appear to have 
<A NAME="70"></A>been before God.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="71"></A><B>Chapter 5</B>

<A NAME="72"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> Heaven and earth do not act from (the impulse of) any 
<A NAME="73"></A>wish to be benevolent; they deal with all things as the dogs of grass are 
<A NAME="74"></A>dealt with.  The sages do not act from (any wish to be) benevolent; they 
<A NAME="75"></A>deal with the people as the dogs of grass are dealt 
<A NAME="76"></A>with.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> May not the space between heaven and earth be compared 
<A NAME="78"></A>to a bellows?
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>'Tis emptied, yet it loses not its power;
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>'Tis moved again, and sends forth air the more.
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>Much speech to swift exhaustion lead we see;
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>Your inner being guard, and keep it free.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="83"></A><B>Chapter 6</B>

<A NAME="84"></A><BR><BR>The valley spirit dies not, aye the same;
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>The female mystery thus do we name.
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>Its gate, from which at first they issued forth,
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>Is called the root from which grew heaven and earth.
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>Long and unbroken does its power remain,
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>Used gently, and without the touch of pain.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="90"></A><B>Chapter 7</B>

<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> Heaven is long-enduring and earth continues long.  The 
<A NAME="92"></A>reason why heaven and earth are able to endure and continue thus long is 
<A NAME="93"></A>because they do not live of, or for, themselves.  This is how they are 
<A NAME="94"></A>able to continue and endure.
<A NAME="95"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> Therefore the sage puts his own person last, and yet 
<A NAME="96"></A>it is found in the foremost place; he treats his person as if it were foreign 
<A NAME="97"></A>to him, and yet that person is preserved.  Is it not because he has no 
<A NAME="98"></A>personal and private ends, that therefore such ends are 
<A NAME="99"></A>realised?
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="100"></A><B>Chapter 8</B>

<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> The highest excellence is like (that of) water.  The 
<A NAME="102"></A>excellence of water appears in its benefiting all things, and in its occupying, 
<A NAME="103"></A>without striving (to the contrary), the low place which all men dislike. 
<A NAME="104"></A> Hence (its way) is near to (that of) the Tao.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> The excellence of a residence is in (the suitability 
<A NAME="106"></A>of) the place; that of the mind is in abysmal stillness; that of associations 
<A NAME="107"></A>is in their being with the virtuous; that of government is in its securing 
<A NAME="108"></A>good order; that of (the conduct of) affairs is in its ability; and that 
<A NAME="109"></A>of (the initiation of) any movement is in its timeliness.
<A NAME="110"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> And when (one with the highest excellence) does not wrangle 
<A NAME="111"></A>(about his low position), no one finds fault with him.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="112"></A><B>Chapter 9</B>

<A NAME="113"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> It is better to leave a vessel unfilled, than to attempt 
<A NAME="114"></A>to carry it when it is full.  If you keep feeling a point that has been 
<A NAME="115"></A>sharpened, the point cannot long preserve its sharpness.
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> When gold and jade fill the hall, their possessor cannot 
<A NAME="117"></A>keep them safe.  When wealth and honours lead to arrogancy, this brings 
<A NAME="118"></A>its evil on itself.  When the work is done, and one's name is becoming 
<A NAME="119"></A>distinguished, to withdraw into obscurity is the way of 
<A NAME="120"></A>Heaven.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="121"></A><B>Chapter 10</B>

<A NAME="122"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> When the intelligent and animal souls are held together 
<A NAME="123"></A>in one embrace, they can be kept from separating.  When one gives undivided 
<A NAME="124"></A>attention to the (vital) breath, and brings it to the utmost degree of 
<A NAME="125"></A>pliancy, he can become as a (tender) babe.  When he has cleansed away the 
<A NAME="126"></A>most mysterious sights (of his imagination), he can become without a 
<A NAME="127"></A>flaw.
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> In loving the people and ruling the state, cannot he 
<A NAME="129"></A>proceed without any (purpose of) action?  In the opening and shutting of 
<A NAME="130"></A>his gates of heaven, cannot he do so as a female bird?  While his intelligence 
<A NAME="131"></A>reaches in every direction, cannot he (appear to) be without 
<A NAME="132"></A>knowledge?
<A NAME="133"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> (The Tao) produces (all things) and nourishes them; it 
<A NAME="134"></A>produces them and does not claim them as its own; it does all, and yet 
<A NAME="135"></A>does not boast of it; it presides over all, and yet does not control them. 
<A NAME="136"></A>This is what is called 'The mysterious Quality' (of the 
<A NAME="137"></A>Tao).
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="138"></A><B>Chapter 11</B>
<A NAME="139"></A>The thirty spokes unite in the one nave; but it is on the empty space (for 
<A NAME="140"></A>the axle), that the use of the wheel depends.  Clay is fashioned into vessels; 
<A NAME="141"></A>but it is on their empty hollowness, that their use depends.  The door 
<A NAME="142"></A>and windows are cut out (from the walls) to form an apartment; but it is 
<A NAME="143"></A>on the empty space (within), that its use depends.  Therefore, what has 
<A NAME="144"></A>a (positive) existence serves for profitable adaptation, and what has not 
<A NAME="145"></A>that for (actual) usefulness.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="146"></A><B>Chapter 12</B>

<A NAME="147"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> Colour's five hues from th' eyes their sight will 
<A NAME="148"></A>take;
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>Music's five notes the ears as deaf can make;
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>The flavours five deprive the mouth of taste;
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>The chariot course, and the wild hunting waste
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>Make mad the mind; and objects rare and strange,
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>Sought for, men's conduct will to evil change.
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> Therefore the sage seeks to satisfy (the craving of) 
<A NAME="155"></A>the belly, and not the (insatiable longing of the) eyes.  He puts from 
<A NAME="156"></A>him the latter, and prefers to seek the former.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="157"></A><B>Chapter 13</B>

<A NAME="158"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> Favour and disgrace would seem equally to be feared; 
<A NAME="159"></A>honour and great calamity, to be regarded as personal conditions (of the 
<A NAME="160"></A>same kind).
<A NAME="161"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> What is meant by speaking thus of favour and disgrace? 
<A NAME="162"></A> Disgrace is being in a low position (after the enjoyment of favour). 
<A NAME="163"></A> The getting that (favour) leads to the apprehension (of losing it), and 
<A NAME="164"></A>the losing it leads to the fear of (still greater calamity):--this is what 
<A NAME="165"></A>is meant by saying that favour and disgrace would seem equally to be feared. 
<A NAME="166"></A>And what is meant by saying that honour and great calamity are to be (similarly) 
<A NAME="167"></A>regarded as personal conditions?  What makes me liable to great calamity 
<A NAME="168"></A>is my having the body (which I call myself); if I had not the body, what 
<A NAME="169"></A>great calamity could come to me?
<A NAME="170"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> Therefore he who would administer the kingdom, honouring 
<A NAME="171"></A>it as he honours his own person, may be employed to govern it, and he who 
<A NAME="172"></A>would administer it with the love which he bears to his own person may 
<A NAME="173"></A>be entrusted with it.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="174"></A><B>Chapter 14</B>

<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> We look at it, and we do not see it, and we name it 'the 
<A NAME="176"></A>Equable.'  We listen to it, and we do not hear it, and we name it 'the 
<A NAME="177"></A>Inaudible.'  We try to grasp it, and do not get hold of it, and we name 
<A NAME="178"></A>it 'the Subtle.'  With these three qualities, it cannot be made the subject 
<A NAME="179"></A>of description; and hence we blend them together and obtain The 
<A NAME="180"></A>One.
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> Its upper part is not bright, and its lower part is not 
<A NAME="182"></A>obscure. Ceaseless in its action, it yet cannot be named, and then it again 
<A NAME="183"></A>returns and becomes nothing.  This is called the Form of the Formless, 
<A NAME="184"></A>and the Semblance of the Invisible; this is called the Fleeting and 
<A NAME="185"></A>Indeterminable.
<A NAME="186"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> We meet it and do not see its Front; we follow it, and 
<A NAME="187"></A>do not see its Back.  When we can lay hold of the Tao of old to direct 
<A NAME="188"></A>the things of the present day, and are able to know it as it was of old 
<A NAME="189"></A>in the beginning, this is called (unwinding) the clue of 
<A NAME="190"></A>Tao.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="191"></A><B>Chapter 15</B>

<A NAME="192"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> The skilful masters (of the Tao) in old times, with a 
<A NAME="193"></A>subtle and exquisite penetration, comprehended its mysteries, and were 
<A NAME="194"></A>deep (also) so as to elude men's knowledge.  As they were thus beyond men's 
<A NAME="195"></A>knowledge, I will make an effort to describe of what sort they appeared 
<A NAME="196"></A>to be.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> Shrinking looked they like those who wade through a stream 
<A NAME="198"></A>in winter; irresolute like those who are afraid of all around them; grave 
<A NAME="199"></A>like a guest (in awe of his host); evanescent like ice that is melting 
<A NAME="200"></A>away; unpretentious like wood that has not been fashioned into anything; 
<A NAME="201"></A>vacant like a valley, and dull like muddy water.
<A NAME="202"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> Who can (make) the muddy water (clear)?  Let it be still, 
<A NAME="203"></A>and it will gradually become clear.  Who can secure the condition of rest? 
<A NAME="204"></A>Let movement go on, and the condition of rest will gradually 
<A NAME="205"></A>arise.
<A NAME="206"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> They who preserve this method of the Tao do not wish 
<A NAME="207"></A>to be full (of themselves).  It is through their not being full of themselves 
<A NAME="208"></A>that they can afford to seem worn and not appear new and 
<A NAME="209"></A>complete.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="210"></A><B>Chapter 16</B>

<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> The (state of) vacancy should be brought to the utmost 
<A NAME="212"></A>degree, and that of stillness guarded with unwearying vigour.  All things 
<A NAME="213"></A>alike go through their processes of activity, and (then) we see them return 
<A NAME="214"></A>(to their original state).  When things (in the vegetable world) have displayed 
<A NAME="215"></A>their luxuriant growth, we see each of them return to its root.  This returning 
<A NAME="216"></A>to their root is what we call the state of stillness; and that stillness 
<A NAME="217"></A>may be called a reporting that they have fulfilled their appointed 
<A NAME="218"></A>end.
<A NAME="219"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> The report of that fulfilment is the regular, unchanging 
<A NAME="220"></A>rule.  To know that unchanging rule is to be intelligent; not to know it 
<A NAME="221"></A>leads to wild movements and evil issues.  The knowledge of that unchanging 
<A NAME="222"></A>rule produces a (grand) capacity and forbearance, and that capacity and 
<A NAME="223"></A>forbearance lead to a community (of feeling with all things). From this 
<A NAME="224"></A>community of feeling comes a kingliness of character; and he who is king-like 
<A NAME="225"></A>goes on to be heaven-like.  In that likeness to heaven he possesses the 
<A NAME="226"></A>Tao.  Possessed of the Tao, he endures long; and to the end of his bodily 
<A NAME="227"></A>life, is exempt from all danger of decay.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="228"></A><B>Chapter 17</B>

<A NAME="229"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> In the highest antiquity, (the people) did not know that 
<A NAME="230"></A>there were (their rulers).  In the next age they loved them and praised 
<A NAME="231"></A>them.  In the next they feared them; in the next they despised them. Thus 
<A NAME="232"></A>it was that when faith (in the Tao) was deficient (in the rulers) a want 
<A NAME="233"></A>of faith in them ensued (in the people).
<A NAME="234"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> How irresolute did those (earliest rulers) appear, showing 
<A NAME="235"></A>(by their reticence) the importance which they set upon their words! Their 
<A NAME="236"></A>work was done and their undertakings were successful, while the people 
<A NAME="237"></A>all said, 'We are as we are, of ourselves!'
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="238"></A><B>Chapter 18</B>

<A NAME="239"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> When the Great Tao (Way or Method) ceased to be observed, 
<A NAME="240"></A>benevolence and righteousness came into vogue.  (Then) appeared wisdom 
<A NAME="241"></A>and shrewdness, and there ensued great hypocrisy.
<A NAME="242"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> When harmony no longer prevailed throughout the six kinships, 
<A NAME="243"></A>filial sons found their manifestation; when the states and clans fell into 
<A NAME="244"></A>disorder, loyal ministers appeared.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="245"></A><B>Chapter 19</B>

<A NAME="246"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> If we could renounce our sageness and discard our wisdom, 
<A NAME="247"></A>it would be better for the people a hundredfold.  If we could renounce 
<A NAME="248"></A>our benevolence and discard our righteousness, the people would again become 
<A NAME="249"></A>filial and kindly.  If we could renounce our artful contrivances and discard 
<A NAME="250"></A>our (scheming for) gain, there would be no thieves nor 
<A NAME="251"></A>robbers.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> Those three methods (of government)
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>Thought olden ways in elegance did fail
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>And made these names their want of worth to veil;
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>But simple views, and courses plain and true
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>Would selfish ends and many lusts eschew.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="257"></A><B>Chapter 20</B>

<A NAME="258"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> When we renounce learning we have no 
<A NAME="259"></A>troubles.
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>The (ready) 'yes,' and (flattering) 'yea;'--
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>Small is the difference they display.
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>But mark their issues, good and ill;--
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>What space the gulf between shall fill? What all men fear is indeed 
<A NAME="264"></A>to be feared; but how wide and without end is the range of questions (asking 
<A NAME="265"></A>to be discussed)!
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> The multitude of men look satisfied and pleased; as if 
<A NAME="267"></A>enjoying a full banquet, as if mounted on a tower in spring.  I alone seem 
<A NAME="268"></A>listless and still, my desires having as yet given no indication of their 
<A NAME="269"></A>presence.  I am like an infant which has not yet smiled.  I look dejected 
<A NAME="270"></A>and forlorn, as if I had no home to go to.  The multitude of men all have 
<A NAME="271"></A>enough and to spare.  I alone seem to have lost everything.  My mind is 
<A NAME="272"></A>that of a stupid man; I am in a state of chaos. Ordinary men look bright 
<A NAME="273"></A>and intelligent, while I alone seem to be benighted.  They look full of 
<A NAME="274"></A>discrimination, while I alone am dull and confused.  I seem to be carried 
<A NAME="275"></A>about as on the sea, drifting as if I had nowhere to rest.  All men have 
<A NAME="276"></A>their spheres of action, while I alone seem dull and incapable, like a 
<A NAME="277"></A>rude borderer.  (Thus) I alone am different from other men, but I value 
<A NAME="278"></A>the nursing-mother (the Tao).
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="279"></A><B>Chapter 21</B>

<A NAME="280"></A><BR><BR>The grandest forms of active force
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>From Tao come, their only source.
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>Who can of Tao the nature tell?
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>Our sight it flies, our touch as well.
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>Eluding sight, eluding touch,
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>The forms of things all in it crouch;
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>Eluding touch, eluding sight,
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>There are their semblances, all right.
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>Profound it is, dark and obscure;
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>Things' essences all there endure.
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>Those essences the truth enfold
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>Of what, when seen, shall then be told.
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>Now it is so; 'twas so of old.
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>Its name--what passes not away;
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>So, in their beautiful array,
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>Things form and never know decay.
<A NAME="296"></A><BR><BR>How know I that it is so with all the beauties of existing things? 
<A NAME="297"></A> By this (nature of the Tao).
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="298"></A><B>Chapter 22</B>

<A NAME="299"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> The partial becomes complete; the crooked, straight; 
<A NAME="300"></A>the empty, full; the worn out, new.  He whose (desires) are few gets them; 
<A NAME="301"></A>he whose (desires) are many goes astray.
<A NAME="302"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> Therefore the sage holds in his embrace the one thing 
<A NAME="303"></A>(of humility), and manifests it to all the world.  He is free from self- 
<A NAME="304"></A>display, and therefore he shines; from self-assertion, and therefore he 
<A NAME="305"></A>is distinguished; from self-boasting, and therefore his merit is acknowledged; 
<A NAME="306"></A>from self-complacency, and therefore he acquires superiority.  It is because 
<A NAME="307"></A>he is thus free from striving that therefore no one in the world is able 
<A NAME="308"></A>to strive with him.
<A NAME="309"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> That saying of the ancients that 'the partial becomes 
<A NAME="310"></A>complete' was not vainly spoken:--all real completion is comprehended under 
<A NAME="311"></A>it.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="312"></A><B>Chapter 23</B>

<A NAME="313"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> Abstaining from speech marks him who is obeying the spontaneity 
<A NAME="314"></A>of his nature.  A violent wind does not last for a whole morning; a sudden 
<A NAME="315"></A>rain does not last for the whole day.  To whom is it that these (two) things 
<A NAME="316"></A>are owing?  To Heaven and Earth.  If Heaven and Earth cannot make such 
<A NAME="317"></A>(spasmodic) actings last long, how much less can man!
<A NAME="318"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> Therefore when one is making the Tao his business, those 
<A NAME="319"></A>who are also pursuing it, agree with him in it, and those who are making 
<A NAME="320"></A>the manifestation of its course their object agree with him in that; while 
<A NAME="321"></A>even those who are failing in both these things agree with him where they 
<A NAME="322"></A>fail.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> Hence, those with whom he agrees as to the Tao have the 
<A NAME="324"></A>happiness of attaining to it; those with whom he agrees as to its manifestation 
<A NAME="325"></A>have the happiness of attaining to it; and those with whom he agrees in 
<A NAME="326"></A>their failure have also the happiness of attaining (to the Tao). (But) 
<A NAME="327"></A>when there is not faith sufficient (on his part), a want of faith (in him) 
<A NAME="328"></A>ensues (on the part of the others).
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="329"></A><B>Chapter 24</B>

<A NAME="330"></A><BR><BR>He who stands on his tiptoes does not stand firm; he who stretches 
<A NAME="331"></A>his legs does not walk (easily).  (So), he who displays himself does not 
<A NAME="332"></A>shine; he who asserts his own views is not distinguished; he who vaunts 
<A NAME="333"></A>himself does not find his merit acknowledged; he who is self- conceited 
<A NAME="334"></A>has no superiority allowed to him.  Such conditions, viewed from the standpoint 
<A NAME="335"></A>of the Tao, are like remnants of food, or a tumour on the body, which all 
<A NAME="336"></A>dislike.  Hence those who pursue (the course) of the Tao do not adopt and 
<A NAME="337"></A>allow them.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="338"></A><B>Chapter 25</B>

<A NAME="339"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> There was something undefined and complete, coming into 
<A NAME="340"></A>existence before Heaven and Earth.  How still it was and formless, standing 
<A NAME="341"></A>alone, and undergoing no change, reaching everywhere and in no danger (of 
<A NAME="342"></A>being exhausted)!  It may be regarded as the Mother of all 
<A NAME="343"></A>things.
<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> I do not know its name, and I give it the designation 
<A NAME="345"></A>of the Tao (the Way or Course).  Making an effort (further) to give it 
<A NAME="346"></A>a name I call it The Great.
<A NAME="347"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> Great, it passes on (in constant flow).  Passing on, 
<A NAME="348"></A>it becomes remote.  Having become remote, it returns.  Therefore the Tao 
<A NAME="349"></A>is great; Heaven is great; Earth is great; and the (sage) king is also 
<A NAME="350"></A>great.  In the universe there are four that are great, and the (sage) king 
<A NAME="351"></A>is one of them.
<A NAME="352"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> Man takes his law from the Earth; the Earth takes its 
<A NAME="353"></A>law from Heaven; Heaven takes its law from the Tao.  The law of the Tao 
<A NAME="354"></A>is its being what it is.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="355"></A><B>Chapter 26</B>

<A NAME="356"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> Gravity is the root of lightness; stillness, the ruler 
<A NAME="357"></A>of movement.
<A NAME="358"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> Therefore a wise prince, marching the whole day, does 
<A NAME="359"></A>not go far from his baggage waggons.  Although he may have brilliant prospects 
<A NAME="360"></A>to look at, he quietly remains (in his proper place), indifferent to them. 
<A NAME="361"></A> How should the lord of a myriad chariots carry himself lightly before 
<A NAME="362"></A>the kingdom?  If he do act lightly, he has lost his root (of gravity); 
<A NAME="363"></A>if he proceed to active movement, he will lose his throne.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="364"></A><B>Chapter 27</B>

<A NAME="365"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> The skilful traveller leaves no traces of his wheels 
<A NAME="366"></A>or footsteps; the skilful speaker says nothing that can be found fault 
<A NAME="367"></A>with or blamed; the skilful reckoner uses no tallies; the skilful closer 
<A NAME="368"></A>needs no bolts or bars, while to open what he has shut will be impossible; 
<A NAME="369"></A>the skilful binder uses no strings or knots, while to unloose what he has 
<A NAME="370"></A>bound will be impossible.  In the same way the sage is always skilful at 
<A NAME="371"></A>saving men, and so he does not cast away any man; he is always skilful 
<A NAME="372"></A>at saving things, and so he does not cast away anything.  This is called 
<A NAME="373"></A>'Hiding the light of his procedure.'
<A NAME="374"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> Therefore the man of skill is a master (to be looked 
<A NAME="375"></A>up to) by him who has not the skill; and he who has not the skill is the 
<A NAME="376"></A>helper of (the reputation of) him who has the skill.  If the one did not 
<A NAME="377"></A>honour his master, and the other did not rejoice in his helper, an (observer), 
<A NAME="378"></A>though intelligent, might greatly err about them.  This is called 'The 
<A NAME="379"></A>utmost degree of mystery.'
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="380"></A><B>Chapter 28</B>

<A NAME="381"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> Who knows his manhood's strength,
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>Yet still his female feebleness maintains;
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>As to one channel flow the many drains,
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>All come to him, yea, all beneath the sky.
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>Thus he the constant excellence retains;
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>The simple child again, free from all stains.
<A NAME="387"></A><BR><BR>Who knows how white attracts,
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>Yet always keeps himself within black's shade,
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>The pattern of humility displayed,
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>Displayed in view of all beneath the sky;
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>He in the unchanging excellence arrayed,
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>Endless return to man's first state has made.
<A NAME="393"></A><BR><BR>Who knows how glory shines,
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>Yet loves disgrace, nor e'er for it is pale;
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>Behold his presence in a spacious vale,
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>To which men come from all beneath the sky.
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>The unchanging excellence completes its tale;
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>The simple infant man in him we hail.
<A NAME="399"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> The unwrought material, when divided and distributed, 
<A NAME="400"></A>forms vessels.  The sage, when employed, becomes the Head of all the Officers 
<A NAME="401"></A>(of government); and in his greatest regulations he employs no violent 
<A NAME="402"></A>measures.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="403"></A><B>Chapter 29</B>

<A NAME="404"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> If any one should wish to get the kingdom for himself, 
<A NAME="405"></A>and to effect this by what he does, I see that he will not succeed.  The 
<A NAME="406"></A>kingdom is a spirit-like thing, and cannot be got by active doing.  He 
<A NAME="407"></A>who would so win it destroys it; he who would hold it in his grasp loses 
<A NAME="408"></A>it.
<A NAME="409"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> The course and nature of things is such 
<A NAME="410"></A>that
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>What was in front is now behind;
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>What warmed anon we freezing find.
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>Strength is of weakness oft the spoil;
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>The store in ruins mocks our toil. Hence the sage puts away excessive 
<A NAME="415"></A>effort, extravagance, and easy indulgence.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="416"></A><B>Chapter 30</B>

<A NAME="417"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> He who would assist a lord of men in harmony with the 
<A NAME="418"></A>Tao will not assert his mastery in the kingdom by force of arms.  Such 
<A NAME="419"></A>a course is sure to meet with its proper return.
<A NAME="420"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> Wherever a host is stationed, briars and thorns spring 
<A NAME="421"></A>up.  In the sequence of great armies there are sure to be bad 
<A NAME="422"></A>years.
<A NAME="423"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> A skilful (commander) strikes a decisive blow, and stops. 
<A NAME="424"></A> He does not dare (by continuing his operations) to assert and complete 
<A NAME="425"></A>his mastery.  He will strike the blow, but will be on his guard against 
<A NAME="426"></A>being vain or boastful or arrogant in consequence of it.  He strikes it 
<A NAME="427"></A>as a matter of necessity; he strikes it, but not from a wish for 
<A NAME="428"></A>mastery.
<A NAME="429"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> When things have attained their strong maturity they 
<A NAME="430"></A>become old. This may be said to be not in accordance with the Tao: and 
<A NAME="431"></A>what is not in accordance with it soon comes to an end.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="432"></A><B>Chapter 31</B>

<A NAME="433"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> Now arms, however beautiful, are instruments of evil 
<A NAME="434"></A>omen, hateful, it may be said, to all creatures.  Therefore they who have 
<A NAME="435"></A>the Tao do not like to employ them.
<A NAME="436"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> The superior man ordinarily considers the left hand the 
<A NAME="437"></A>most honourable place, but in time of war the right hand.  Those sharp 
<A NAME="438"></A>weapons are instruments of evil omen, and not the instruments of the superior 
<A NAME="439"></A>man;--he uses them only on the compulsion of necessity.  Calm and repose 
<A NAME="440"></A>are what he prizes; victory (by force of arms) is to him undesirable. 
<A NAME="441"></A> To consider this desirable would be to delight in the slaughter of men; 
<A NAME="442"></A>and he who delights in the slaughter of men cannot get his will in the 
<A NAME="443"></A>kingdom.
<A NAME="444"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> On occasions of festivity to be on the left hand is the 
<A NAME="445"></A>prized position; on occasions of mourning, the right hand.  The second 
<A NAME="446"></A>in command of the army has his place on the left; the general commanding 
<A NAME="447"></A>in chief has his on the right;--his place, that is, is assigned to him 
<A NAME="448"></A>as in the rites of mourning.  He who has killed multitudes of men should 
<A NAME="449"></A>weep for them with the bitterest grief; and the victor in battle has his 
<A NAME="450"></A>place (rightly) according to those rites.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="451"></A><B>Chapter 32</B>

<A NAME="452"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> The Tao, considered as unchanging, has no 
<A NAME="453"></A>name.
<A NAME="454"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> Though in its primordial simplicity it may be small, 
<A NAME="455"></A>the whole world dares not deal with (one embodying) it as a minister. 
<A NAME="456"></A> If a feudal prince or the king could guard and hold it, all would spontaneously 
<A NAME="457"></A>submit themselves to him.
<A NAME="458"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> Heaven and Earth (under its guidance) unite together 
<A NAME="459"></A>and send down the sweet dew, which, without the directions of men, reaches 
<A NAME="460"></A>equally everywhere as of its own accord.
<A NAME="461"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> As soon as it proceeds to action, it has a name.  When 
<A NAME="462"></A>it once has that name, (men) can know to rest in it.  When they know to 
<A NAME="463"></A>rest in it, they can be free from all risk of failure and 
<A NAME="464"></A>error.
<A NAME="465"></A><BR><BR><B>5.</B> The relation of the Tao to all the world is like that 
<A NAME="466"></A>of the great rivers and seas to the streams from the 
<A NAME="467"></A>valleys.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="468"></A><B>Chapter 33</B>

<A NAME="469"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> He who knows other men is discerning; he who knows himself 
<A NAME="470"></A>is intelligent.  He who overcomes others is strong; he who overcomes himself 
<A NAME="471"></A>is mighty.  He who is satisfied with his lot is rich; he who goes on acting 
<A NAME="472"></A>with energy has a (firm) will.
<A NAME="473"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> He who does not fail in the requirements of his position, 
<A NAME="474"></A>continues long; he who dies and yet does not perish, has 
<A NAME="475"></A>longevity.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="476"></A><B>Chapter 34</B>

<A NAME="477"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> All-pervading is the Great Tao!  It may be found on the 
<A NAME="478"></A>left hand and on the right.
<A NAME="479"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> All things depend on it for their production, which it 
<A NAME="480"></A>gives to them, not one refusing obedience to it.  When its work is accomplished, 
<A NAME="481"></A>it does not claim the name of having done it.  It clothes all things as 
<A NAME="482"></A>with a garment, and makes no assumption of being their lord;--it may be 
<A NAME="483"></A>named in the smallest things.  All things return (to their root and disappear), 
<A NAME="484"></A>and do not know that it is it which presides over their doing so;--it may 
<A NAME="485"></A>be named in the greatest things.
<A NAME="486"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> Hence the sage is able (in the same way) to accomplish 
<A NAME="487"></A>his great achievements.  It is through his not making himself great that 
<A NAME="488"></A>he can accomplish them.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="489"></A><B>Chapter 35</B>

<A NAME="490"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> To him who holds in his hands the Great Image (of the 
<A NAME="491"></A>invisible Tao), the whole world repairs.  Men resort to him, and receive 
<A NAME="492"></A>no hurt, but (find) rest, peace, and the feeling of 
<A NAME="493"></A>ease.
<A NAME="494"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> Music and dainties will make the passing guest stop (for 
<A NAME="495"></A>a time). But though the Tao as it comes from the mouth, seems insipid and 
<A NAME="496"></A>has no flavour, though it seems not worth being looked at or listened to, 
<A NAME="497"></A>the use of it is inexhaustible.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="498"></A><B>Chapter 36</B>

<A NAME="499"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> When one is about to take an inspiration, he is sure 
<A NAME="500"></A>to make a (previous) expiration; when he is going to weaken another, he 
<A NAME="501"></A>will first strengthen him; when he is going to overthrow another, he will 
<A NAME="502"></A>first have raised him up; when he is going to despoil another, he will 
<A NAME="503"></A>first have made gifts to him:--this is called 'Hiding the light (of his 
<A NAME="504"></A>procedure).'
<A NAME="505"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> The soft overcomes the hard; and the weak the 
<A NAME="506"></A>strong.
<A NAME="507"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> Fishes should not be taken from the deep; instruments 
<A NAME="508"></A>for the profit of a state should not be shown to the 
<A NAME="509"></A>people.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="510"></A><B>Chapter 37</B>

<A NAME="511"></A><BR><BR><B>1.</B> The Tao in its regular course does nothing (for the sake 
<A NAME="512"></A>of doing it), and so there is nothing which it does not 
<A NAME="513"></A>do.
<A NAME="514"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> If princes and kings were able to maintain it, all things 
<A NAME="515"></A>would of themselves be transformed by them.
<A NAME="516"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> If this transformation became to me an object of desire, 
<A NAME="517"></A>I would express the desire by the nameless simplicity.
<A NAME="518"></A><BR><BR>Simplicity without a name
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>Is free from all external aim.
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>With no desire, at rest and still,
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>All things go right as of their will.
