<A NAME="2"></A>
<BR>(legendary, died 149 B.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Marcus cato, we are told, was born at Tusculum, though (till he betook 
<A NAME="11"></A>himself to civil and military affairs) he lived and was bred up in the 
<A NAME="12"></A>country of the Sabines, where his father's estate lay. His ancestors seeming 
<A NAME="13"></A>almost entirely unknown, he himself praises his father Marcus, as a worthy 
<A NAME="14"></A>man and a brave soldier, and Cato, his great-grandfather, too, as one who 
<A NAME="15"></A>had often obtained military prizes, and who, having lost five horses under 
<A NAME="16"></A>him, received, on the account of his valour, the worth of them out of the 
<A NAME="17"></A>public exchequer. Now it being the custom among the Romans to call those 
<A NAME="18"></A>who, having no repute by birth, made themselves eminent by their own exertions, 
<A NAME="19"></A>new men or upstarts, they called even Cato himself so, and so he confessed 
<A NAME="20"></A>himself to be as to any public distinction or employment, but yet asserted 
<A NAME="21"></A>that in the exploits and virtues of his ancestors he was very ancient. 
<A NAME="22"></A>His third name originally was not Cato, but Priscus, though afterwards 
<A NAME="23"></A>he had the surname of Cato, by reason of his abilities; for the Romans 
<A NAME="24"></A>call a skilful or experienced man Catus. He was of a ruddy complexion and 
<A NAME="25"></A>grey-eyed; as the writer, who, with no good-will, made the following epigram 
<A NAME="26"></A>upon him lets us see:-
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR>"Porcius, who snarls at all in every place,
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>With his grey eyes, and with his fiery face,
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>Even after death will scarce admitted be
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>Into the infernal realms by Hecate."
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR>He gained, in early life, a good habit of body by working with 
<A NAME="32"></A>his own hands, and living temperately, and serving in war; and seemed to 
<A NAME="33"></A>have an equal proportion both of health and strength. And he exerted and 
<A NAME="34"></A>practised his eloquence through all the neighbourhood and little villages; 
<A NAME="35"></A>thinking it as requisite as a second body, and an all but necessary organ 
<A NAME="36"></A>to one who looks forward to something above a mere humble and inactive 
<A NAME="37"></A>life. He would never refuse to be counsel for those who needed him, and 
<A NAME="38"></A>was, indeed, early reckoned a good lawyer, and, ere long, a capable 
<A NAME="39"></A>orator.
<A NAME="40"></A><BR><BR>Hence his solidity and depth of character showed itself gradually 
<A NAME="41"></A>more and more to those with whom he was concerned, and claimed, as it were, 
<A NAME="42"></A>employment in great affairs and places of public command. Nor did he merely 
<A NAME="43"></A>abstain from taking fees for his counsel and pleading, but did not even 
<A NAME="44"></A>seem to put any high price on the honour which proceeded from such kind 
<A NAME="45"></A>of combats, seeming much more desirous to signalize himself in the camp 
<A NAME="46"></A>and in real fights; and while yet but a youth, had his breast covered with 
<A NAME="47"></A>scars he had received from the enemy: being (as he himself says) but seventeen 
<A NAME="48"></A>years old when he made his first campaign; in the time when Hannibal, in 
<A NAME="49"></A>the height of his success, was burning and pillaging all Italy. In engagements 
<A NAME="50"></A>he would strike boldly, without flinching, stand firm to his ground, fix 
<A NAME="51"></A>a bold countenance upon his enemies, and with a harsh threatening voice 
<A NAME="52"></A>accost them, justly thinking himself and telling others that such a rugged 
<A NAME="53"></A>kind of behaviour sometimes terrifies the enemy more than the sword itself, 
<A NAME="54"></A>In his marches he bore his own arms on foot, whilst one servant only followed, 
<A NAME="55"></A>to carry the provision for his table, with whom he is said never to have 
<A NAME="56"></A>been angry or hasty whilst he made ready his dinner or supper, but would, 
<A NAME="57"></A>for the most part, when he was free from military duty, assist and help 
<A NAME="58"></A>him himself to dress it. When he was with the army, he used to drink only 
<A NAME="59"></A>water; unless, perhaps, when extremely thirsty, he might mingle it with 
<A NAME="60"></A>a little vinegar, or if he found his strength fail him, take a little 
<A NAME="61"></A>wine.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR>The little country house of Manius Curius, who had been thrice 
<A NAME="63"></A>carried in triumph, happened to be near his farm; so that often going thither, 
<A NAME="64"></A>and contemplating the small compass of the place, and plainness of the 
<A NAME="65"></A>dwelling, he formed an idea of the mind of the person, who being one of 
<A NAME="66"></A>the greatest of the Romans, and having subdued the most warlike nations, 
<A NAME="67"></A>nay, had driven Pyrrhus out of Italy, now, after three triumphs, was contented 
<A NAME="68"></A>to dig in so small a piece of ground, and live in such a cottage. Here 
<A NAME="69"></A>it was that the ambassadors of the Samnites, finding him boiling turnips 
<A NAME="70"></A>in the chimney corner, offered him a present of gold; but he sent them 
<A NAME="71"></A>away with this saying; that he, who was content with such a supper, had 
<A NAME="72"></A>no need of gold; and that he thought it more honourable to conquer those 
<A NAME="73"></A>who possessed the gold, than to possess the gold itself. Cato, after reflecting 
<A NAME="74"></A>upon these things, used to return and, reviewing his own farm, his servants, 
<A NAME="75"></A>and housekeeping, increase his labour and retrench all superfluous 
<A NAME="76"></A>expenses.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>When Fabius Maximus took Tarentum, Cato, being then but a youth, 
<A NAME="78"></A>was a soldier under him; and being lodged with one Nearchus, a Pythagorean, 
<A NAME="79"></A>desired to understand some of his doctrine, and hearing from him the language, 
<A NAME="80"></A>which Plato also uses- that pleasure is evil's chief bait; the body the 
<A NAME="81"></A>principal calamity of the soul; and that those thoughts which most separate 
<A NAME="82"></A>and take it off from the affections of the body most enfranchise and purify 
<A NAME="83"></A>it; he fell in love the more with frugality and temperance. With this exception, 
<A NAME="84"></A>he is said not to have studied Greek until when he was pretty old; and 
<A NAME="85"></A>in rhetoric to have then profited a little by Thucydides, but more by Demosthenes; 
<A NAME="86"></A>his writings, however, are considerably embellished with Greek sayings 
<A NAME="87"></A>and stories; nay, many of these, translated word for word, are placed with 
<A NAME="88"></A>his own opophthegms and sentences.
<A NAME="89"></A><BR><BR>There was a man of the highest rank, and very influential among 
<A NAME="90"></A>the Romans, called Valerius Flaccus, who was singularly skilful in discerning 
<A NAME="91"></A>excellence yet in the bud, and also much disposed to nourish and advance 
<A NAME="92"></A>it. He, it seems, had lands bordering upon Cato's; nor could he but admire 
<A NAME="93"></A>when he understood from his servants the manner of his living, how he laboured 
<A NAME="94"></A>with his own hands, went on foot betimes in the morning to the courts to 
<A NAME="95"></A>assist those who wanted his counsel: how, returning home again, when it 
<A NAME="96"></A>was winter, he would throw a loose frock over his shoulders, and in the 
<A NAME="97"></A>summer time would work without anything on among his domestics, sit down 
<A NAME="98"></A>with them, eat of the same bread, and drink of the same wine. When they 
<A NAME="99"></A>spoke, also, of other good qualities, his fair dealing and moderation, 
<A NAME="100"></A>mentioning also some of his wise sayings, he ordered that he should be 
<A NAME="101"></A>invited to supper; and thus becoming personally assured of his fine temper 
<A NAME="102"></A>and his superior character, which, like a plant, seemed only to require 
<A NAME="103"></A>culture and a better situation, he urged and persuaded him to apply himself 
<A NAME="104"></A>to state affairs at Rome. Thither, therefore, he went, and by his pleading 
<A NAME="105"></A>soon gained many friends and admirers; but, Valerius chiefly assisting 
<A NAME="106"></A>his promotion, he first of all got appointed tribune in the army, and afterwards 
<A NAME="107"></A>was made quaestor, or treasurer. And now becoming eminent and noted, he 
<A NAME="108"></A>passed, with Valerius himself, through the greatest commands, being first 
<A NAME="109"></A>his colleague as consul, and then censor. But among all the ancient senators, 
<A NAME="110"></A>he most attached himself to Fabius Maximus; not so much for the honour 
<A NAME="111"></A>of his person, and the greatness of his power, as that he might have before 
<A NAME="112"></A>him his habit and manner of life, as the best examples to follow; and so 
<A NAME="113"></A>he did not hesitate to oppose Scipio the Great, who, being then but a young 
<A NAME="114"></A>man, seemed to set himself against the power of Fabius, and to be envied 
<A NAME="115"></A>by him. For being sent together with him as treasurer, when he saw him, 
<A NAME="116"></A>according to his natural custom, make great expenses, and distribute among 
<A NAME="117"></A>the soldiers without sparing, he freely told him that the expense in itself 
<A NAME="118"></A>was not the greatest thing to be considered, but that he was corrupting 
<A NAME="119"></A>the frugality of the soldiers, by giving them the means to abandon themselves 
<A NAME="120"></A>to unnecessary pleasures and luxuries. Scipio answered, that he had no 
<A NAME="121"></A>need for so accurate a treasurer (bearing on as he was, so to say, full 
<A NAME="122"></A>sail to the war), and that he owed the people an account of his actions, 
<A NAME="123"></A>and not of the money he spent. Hereupon Cato returned from Sicily and, 
<A NAME="124"></A>together with Fabius, made loud complaints in the open senate of Scipio's 
<A NAME="125"></A>lavishing unspeakable sums, and childishly loitering away his time in wrestling 
<A NAME="126"></A>matches and comedies, as if he were not to make war, but holiday; and thus 
<A NAME="127"></A>succeeded in getting some of the tribunes of the people sent to call him 
<A NAME="128"></A>back to Rome, in case the accusations should prove true. But Scipio demonstrating, 
<A NAME="129"></A>as it were, to them, by his preparations, the coming victory, and, being 
<A NAME="130"></A>found merely to be living pleasantly with his friends, when there was nothing 
<A NAME="131"></A>else to do, but in no respect because of that easiness and liberality at 
<A NAME="132"></A>all the more negligent in things of consequence and moment, without impediment, 
<A NAME="133"></A>set sail toward the war.
<A NAME="134"></A><BR><BR>Cato grew more and more powerful by his eloquence, so that he was 
<A NAME="135"></A>commonly called the Roman Demosthenes; but his manner of life was yet more 
<A NAME="136"></A>famous and talked of. For oratorical skill was, as an accomplishment, commonly 
<A NAME="137"></A>studied and sought after by all young men; but he was very rare who would 
<A NAME="138"></A>cultivate the old habits of bodily labour, or prefer a light supper, and 
<A NAME="139"></A>a breakfast which never saw the fire, or be in love with poor clothes and 
<A NAME="140"></A>a homely lodging, or could set his ambition rather on doing without luxuries 
<A NAME="141"></A>than on possessing them. For now the state, unable to keep its purity by 
<A NAME="142"></A>reason of its greatness, and having so many affairs, and people from all 
<A NAME="143"></A>parts under its government, was fain to admit many mixed customers and 
<A NAME="144"></A>new examples of living. With reason, therefore, everybody admired Cato, 
<A NAME="145"></A>when they saw others sink under labours and grow effeminate by pleasures; 
<A NAME="146"></A>and yet beheld him unconquered by either, and that not only when he was 
<A NAME="147"></A>young and desirous of honour, but also when old and grey-headed, after 
<A NAME="148"></A>a consulship and triumph; like some famous victor in the games, persevering 
<A NAME="149"></A>in his exercise and maintaining his character to the very last. He himself 
<A NAME="150"></A>says that he never wore a suit of clothes which cost more than a hundred 
<A NAME="151"></A>drachmas; and that, when he was general and consul, he drank the same wine 
<A NAME="152"></A>which his workmen did; and that the meat or fish which was bought in the 
<A NAME="153"></A>meat-market for his dinner did not cost above thirty asses. All which was 
<A NAME="154"></A>for the sake of the commonwealth, that so his body might be the hardier 
<A NAME="155"></A>for the war. Having a piece of embroidered Babylonian tapestry left him, 
<A NAME="156"></A>he sold it; because none of his farmhouses were so much as plastered. Nor 
<A NAME="157"></A>did he ever buy a slave for above fifteen hundred drachmas; as he did not 
<A NAME="158"></A>seek for effeminate and handsome ones, but able sturdy workmen, horse-keepers 
<A NAME="159"></A>and cow-herds: and these he thought ought to be sold again, when they grew 
<A NAME="160"></A>old, and no useless servants fed in the house. In short, he reckoned nothing 
<A NAME="161"></A>a good bargain which was superfluous; but whatever it was, though sold 
<A NAME="162"></A>for a farthing, he would think it a great price, if you had no need of 
<A NAME="163"></A>it; and was for the purchase of lands for sowing and feeding, rather than 
<A NAME="164"></A>grounds for sweeping and watering.
<A NAME="165"></A><BR><BR>Some imputed these things to petty avarice, but others approved 
<A NAME="166"></A>of him, as if he had only the more strictly denied himself for the rectifying 
<A NAME="167"></A>and amending of others. Yet certainly, in my judgment, it marks an over-rigid 
<A NAME="168"></A>temper for a man to take the work out of his servants as out of brute beasts, 
<A NAME="169"></A>turning them off and selling them in their old age, and thinking there 
<A NAME="170"></A>ought to be no further commerce between man and man than whilst there arises 
<A NAME="171"></A>some profit by it. We see that kindness or humanity has a larger field 
<A NAME="172"></A>than bare justice to exercise itself in; law and justice we cannot, in 
<A NAME="173"></A>the nature of things, employ on others than men; but we may extend our 
<A NAME="174"></A>goodness and charity even to irrational creatures; and such acts flow from 
<A NAME="175"></A>a gentle nature, as water from an abundant spring. It is doubtless the 
<A NAME="176"></A>part of a kind-natured man to keep even worn-out horses and dogs, and not 
<A NAME="177"></A>only take care of them when they are foals and whelps, but also when they 
<A NAME="178"></A>are grown old. The Athenians, when they built their Hecatompedon, turned 
<A NAME="179"></A>those mules loose to feed freely which they had observed to have done the 
<A NAME="180"></A>hardest labour. One of these (they say) came once of itself to offer its 
<A NAME="181"></A>service, and ran along with, nay, and went before, the teams which drew 
<A NAME="182"></A>the wagons up to the acropolis, as if it would incite and encourage them 
<A NAME="183"></A>to draw more stoutly; upon which there passed a vote that the creature 
<A NAME="184"></A>should be kept at the public charge even till it died. The graves of Cimon's 
<A NAME="185"></A>horses, which thrice won the Olympian races, are yet to be seen close by 
<A NAME="186"></A>his own monument. Old Xanthippus, too (amongst many others who buried the 
<A NAME="187"></A>dogs they had bred up), entombed his which swam after his galley to Salamis, 
<A NAME="188"></A>when the people fled from Athens, on the top of a cliff, which they call 
<A NAME="189"></A>the Dog's Tomb to this day. Nor are we to use living creatures like old 
<A NAME="190"></A>shoes or dishes and throw them away when they are worn out or broken with 
<A NAME="191"></A>service; but if it were for nothing else, but by way of study and practice 
<A NAME="192"></A>in humanity, a man ought always to prehabituate himself in these things 
<A NAME="193"></A>to be of a kind and sweet disposition. As to myself, I would not so much 
<A NAME="194"></A>as sell my draught ox on the account of his age, much less for a small 
<A NAME="195"></A>piece of money sell a poor old man, and so chase him, as it were, from 
<A NAME="196"></A>his own country, by turning him not only out of the place where he has 
<A NAME="197"></A>lived a long while, but also out of the manner of living he has been accustomed 
<A NAME="198"></A>to, and that more especially when he would be as useless to the buyer as 
<A NAME="199"></A>to the seller. Yet Cato for all this glories that he left that very horse 
<A NAME="200"></A>in Spain which he used in the wars when he was consul, only because he 
<A NAME="201"></A>would not put the public to the charge of his freight. Whether these acts 
<A NAME="202"></A>are to be ascribed to the greatness or pettiness of his spirit, let every 
<A NAME="203"></A>one argue as they please.
<A NAME="204"></A><BR><BR>For his general temperance, however, and self-control he really 
<A NAME="205"></A>deserves the highest admiration. For when he commanded the army, he never 
<A NAME="206"></A>took for himself, and those that belonged to him, above three bushels of 
<A NAME="207"></A>wheat for a month, and somewhat less than a bushel and a half a day of 
<A NAME="208"></A>barley for his baggage-cattle. And when he entered upon the government 
<A NAME="209"></A>of Sardinia, where his predecessors had been used to require tents, bedding 
<A NAME="210"></A>and clothes upon the public account, and to charge the state heavily with 
<A NAME="211"></A>the cost of provisions and entertainments for a great train of servants 
<A NAME="212"></A>and friends, the difference he showed in his economy was something incredible. 
<A NAME="213"></A>There was nothing of any sort for which he put the public to expense; he 
<A NAME="214"></A>would walk without a carriage to visit the cities, with one only of the 
<A NAME="215"></A>common town officers, who carried his dress, and a cup to offer libation 
<A NAME="216"></A>with. Yet though he seemed thus easy and sparing to all who were under 
<A NAME="217"></A>his power, he, on the other hand, showed most inflexible severity and strictness 
<A NAME="218"></A>in what related to public justice, and was rigorous and precise in what 
<A NAME="219"></A>concerned the ordinances of the commonwealth; so that the Roman government 
<A NAME="220"></A>never seemed more terrible, nor yet more mild than under his 
<A NAME="221"></A>administration.
<A NAME="222"></A><BR><BR>His very manner of speaking seemed to have such a kind of idea 
<A NAME="223"></A>with it; for it was courteous, and yet forcible; pleasant, yet overwhelming; 
<A NAME="224"></A>facetious, yet austere; sententious, and yet vehement; like Socrates, in 
<A NAME="225"></A>the description of Plato, who seemed outwardly to those about him to be 
<A NAME="226"></A>but a simple, talkative, blunt fellow; whilst at the bottom he was full 
<A NAME="227"></A>of such gravity and matter, as would even move tears and touch the very 
<A NAME="228"></A>hearts of his auditors. And, therefore, I know not what has persuaded some 
<A NAME="229"></A>to say that Cato's style was chiefly like that of Lysias. However, let 
<A NAME="230"></A>us leave those to judge of these things who profess most to distinguish 
<A NAME="231"></A>between the several kinds of oratorical style in Latin; whilst we write 
<A NAME="232"></A>down some of his memorable sayings; being of the opinion that a man's character 
<A NAME="233"></A>appears much more by his words than, as some think it does, by his 
<A NAME="234"></A>looks.
<A NAME="235"></A><BR><BR>Being once desirous to dissuade the common people of Rome from 
<A NAME="236"></A>their unseasonable and impetuous clamour for largesses and distributions 
<A NAME="237"></A>of corn, he began thus to harangue them: "It is a difficult task, O citizens, 
<A NAME="238"></A>to make speeches to the belly, which has no ears." Reproving, also, their 
<A NAME="239"></A>sumptuous habits, he said it was hard to preserve a city where a fish sold 
<A NAME="240"></A>for more than an ox. He had a saying, also, that the Roman people were 
<A NAME="241"></A>like sheep; for they, when single, do not obey, but when altogether in 
<A NAME="242"></A>a flock, they follow their leaders: "So you," said he, "when you have got 
<A NAME="243"></A>together in a body, let yourselves be guided by those whom singly you would 
<A NAME="244"></A>never think of being advised by." Discoursing of the power of women: "Men," 
<A NAME="245"></A>said he, "usually command women; but we command all men, and the women 
<A NAME="246"></A>command us." But this, indeed, is borrowed from the sayings of Themistocles, 
<A NAME="247"></A>who, when his son was making many demands of him by means of the mother, 
<A NAME="248"></A>said, "O woman, the Athenians govern the Greeks; I govern the Athenians, 
<A NAME="249"></A>but you govern me, and your son governs you; so let him use his power sparingly, 
<A NAME="250"></A>since, simple as he is, he can do more than all the Greeks together." Another 
<A NAME="251"></A>saying of Cato's was, that the Roman people did not only fix the value 
<A NAME="252"></A>of such and such purple dyes, but also of such and such habits of life: 
<A NAME="253"></A>"For," said he, "as dyers most of all dye such colours as they see to be 
<A NAME="254"></A>most agreeable, so the young men learn, and zealously affect, what is most 
<A NAME="255"></A>popular with you." He also exhorted them that, if they were grown great 
<A NAME="256"></A>by their virtue and temperance, they should not change for the worse; but 
<A NAME="257"></A>if intemperance and vice had made them great, they should change for the 
<A NAME="258"></A>better; for by that means they were grown indeed quite great enough. He 
<A NAME="259"></A>would say, likewise, of men who wanted to be continually in office, that 
<A NAME="260"></A>apparently they did not know their road; since they could not do without 
<A NAME="261"></A>beadles to guide them on it. He also reproved the citizens for choosing 
<A NAME="262"></A>still the same men as their magistrates: "For you will seem," said he, 
<A NAME="263"></A>"either not to esteem government worth much, or to think few worthy to 
<A NAME="264"></A>hold it." Speaking, too, of a certain enemy of his, who lived a very base 
<A NAME="265"></A>and discreditable life: "It is considered," he said, "rather as a curse 
<A NAME="266"></A>than a blessing on him, that this fellow's mother prays that she may leave 
<A NAME="267"></A>him behind her." Pointing at one who had sold the land which his father 
<A NAME="268"></A>had left him, and which lay near the seaside, he pretended to express his 
<A NAME="269"></A>wonder at his being stronger even than the sea itself; for what it washed 
<A NAME="270"></A>away with a great deal of labour, he with a great deal of ease drank away. 
<A NAME="271"></A>When the senate, with a great deal of splendour, received King Eumenes 
<A NAME="272"></A>on his visit to Rome, and the chief citizens strove who should be most 
<A NAME="273"></A>about him, Cato appeared to regard him with suspicion and apprehension; 
<A NAME="274"></A>and when one that stood by, too, took occasion to say that he was a very 
<A NAME="275"></A>good prince and a great lover of the Romans: "It may be so," said Cato; 
<A NAME="276"></A>"but by nature this same animal of a king is a kind of man-eater;" nor, 
<A NAME="277"></A>indeed, were there ever kings who deserved to be compared with Epaminondas, 
<A NAME="278"></A>Pericles, Themistocles, Manius Curius, or Hamilcar, surnamed Barcas. He 
<A NAME="279"></A>used to say, too, that his enemies envied him because he had to get up 
<A NAME="280"></A>every day before light and neglect his own business to follow that of the 
<A NAME="281"></A>public. He would also tell you that he had rather be deprived of the reward 
<A NAME="282"></A>for doing well than not to suffer the punishment for doing ill; and that 
<A NAME="283"></A>he could pardon all offenders but himself.
<A NAME="284"></A><BR><BR>The Romans having sent three ambassadors to Bithynia, of whom one 
<A NAME="285"></A>was gouty, another had his skull trepanned, and the other seemed little 
<A NAME="286"></A>better than a fool, Cato, laughing, gave out that the Romans had sent an 
<A NAME="287"></A>embassy which had neither feet, head, nor heart. His interest being entreated 
<A NAME="288"></A>by Scipio, on account of Polybius, for the Achaean exiles, and there happening 
<A NAME="289"></A>to be a great discussion in the senate about it, some being for, and some 
<A NAME="290"></A>against their return, Cato, standing up, thus delivered himself: "Here 
<A NAME="291"></A>do we sit all day long, as if we had nothing to do but beat our brains 
<A NAME="292"></A>whether these old Greeks should be carried to their graves by the bearers 
<A NAME="293"></A>here or by those in Achaea." The senate voting their return, it seems that 
<A NAME="294"></A>a few days after Polybius's friends further wished that it should be further 
<A NAME="295"></A>moved in the senate that the said banished persons should receive again 
<A NAME="296"></A>the honours which they first had in Achaea; and to this purpose they sounded 
<A NAME="297"></A>Cato for his opinion; but he, smiling, answered, that Polybius, Ulysses 
<A NAME="298"></A>like, having escaped out of the Cyclops' den, wanted, it would seem, to 
<A NAME="299"></A>go back again because he had left his cap and belt behind him. He used 
<A NAME="300"></A>to assert, also, that wise men profited more by fools, than fools by wise 
<A NAME="301"></A>men for that wise men avoided the faults of fools, but that fools would 
<A NAME="302"></A>not imitate the good examples of wise men. He would profess, too, that 
<A NAME="303"></A>he was more taken with young men that blushed than with those who looked 
<A NAME="304"></A>pale; and that he never desired to have a soldier that moved his hands 
<A NAME="305"></A>too much in marching, and his feet too much in fighting; or snored louder 
<A NAME="306"></A>than he shouted. Ridiculing a fat, overgrown man: "What use," said he, 
<A NAME="307"></A>"can the state turn a man's body to, when all between the throat and groin 
<A NAME="308"></A>is taken up by the belly?" When one who was much given to pleasures desired 
<A NAME="309"></A>his acquaintance, begging his pardon, he said he could not live with a 
<A NAME="310"></A>man whose palate was of a quicker sense than his heart. He would likewise 
<A NAME="311"></A>say that the soul of a lover lived in the body of another: and that in 
<A NAME="312"></A>his whole life he most repented of three things; one was, that he had trusted 
<A NAME="313"></A>a secret to a woman; another that he went by water when he might have gone 
<A NAME="314"></A>by land; the third, that he had remained one whole day without doing any 
<A NAME="315"></A>business of moment. Applying himself to an old man who was committing some 
<A NAME="316"></A>vice: "Friend," said he, "old age has of itself blemishes enough; do not 
<A NAME="317"></A>you add to it the deformity of vice." Speaking to a tribune, who was reputed 
<A NAME="318"></A>a Poisoner, and was very violent for the bringing in of a bill, in order 
<A NAME="319"></A>to make a certain law: "Young man," cried he, "I know not which would be 
<A NAME="320"></A>better, to drink, what you mix, or confirm what you would put up for a 
<A NAME="321"></A>law." Being reviled by a fellow who lived a profligate and wicked life: 
<A NAME="322"></A>"A contest," replied he, "is unequal between you and me: for you can hear 
<A NAME="323"></A>ill words easily, and can as easily give them: but it is unpleasant to 
<A NAME="324"></A>me to give such, and unusual to hear them." Such was his manner of expressing 
<A NAME="325"></A>himself in his memorable sayings.
<A NAME="326"></A><BR><BR>Being chosen consul, with his friend and familiar Valerius Flaccus, 
<A NAME="327"></A>the government of that part of Spain which the Romans called the Hither 
<A NAME="328"></A>Spain fell to his lot. Here, as he was engaged in reducing some of the 
<A NAME="329"></A>tribes by force, and bringing over others by good words, a large army of 
<A NAME="330"></A>barbarians fell upon him, so that there was danger of being disgracefully 
<A NAME="331"></A>forced out again. He therefore called upon his neighbours, the Celtiberians, 
<A NAME="332"></A>for help; and on their demanding two hundred talents for their assistance, 
<A NAME="333"></A>everybody else thought it intolerable that even the Romans should promise 
<A NAME="334"></A>barbarians a reward for their aid; but Cato said there was no discredit 
<A NAME="335"></A>or harm in it; for, if they overcame, they would pay them out of the enemy's 
<A NAME="336"></A>purse, and not out of their own; but if they were overcome, there would 
<A NAME="337"></A>be nobody left either to demand the reward or to pay it. However, he won 
<A NAME="338"></A>that battle completely, and, after that, all his other affairs succeeded 
<A NAME="339"></A>splendidly. Polybius says that, by his command, the walls of all the cities 
<A NAME="340"></A>on this side the river Baetis were in one day's time demolished, and yet 
<A NAME="341"></A>there were a great many of them full of brave and warlike men. Cato himself 
<A NAME="342"></A>says that he took more cities than he stayed days in Spain. Neither is 
<A NAME="343"></A>this a mere rhodomontade, if it be true that the number was four hundred. 
<A NAME="344"></A>And though the soldiers themselves had got much in the fights, yet he distributed 
<A NAME="345"></A>a pound of silver to every man of them, saying, it was better that many 
<A NAME="346"></A>of the Romans should return home with silver, rather than a few with gold. 
<A NAME="347"></A>For himself, he affirms, that of all the things that were taken, nothing 
<A NAME="348"></A>came to him beyond what he ate and drank. "Neither do I find fault," continued 
<A NAME="349"></A>he, "with those that seek to profit by these spoils, but I had rather compete 
<A NAME="350"></A>in valour with the best, than in wealth with the richest, or with the most 
<A NAME="351"></A>covetous in love of money." Nor did he merely keep himself clear from taking 
<A NAME="352"></A>anything, but even all those who more immediately belonged to him. He had 
<A NAME="353"></A>five servants with him in the army; one of whom called Paccus, bought three 
<A NAME="354"></A>boys out of those who were taken captive; which Cato coming to understand, 
<A NAME="355"></A>the man, rather than venture into his presence, hanged himself. Cato sold 
<A NAME="356"></A>the boys, and carried the price he got for them into the public 
<A NAME="357"></A>exchequer.
<A NAME="358"></A><BR><BR>Scipio the Great, being his enemy, and desiring, whilst he was 
<A NAME="359"></A>carrying all things so successfully, to obstruct him, and take the affairs 
<A NAME="360"></A>of Spain into his own hands, succeeded in getting himself appointed his 
<A NAME="361"></A>successor in the government, and, making all possible haste, put a term 
<A NAME="362"></A>to Cato's authority. But he, taking with him a convoy of five cohorts of 
<A NAME="363"></A>foot and five hundred horse to attend him home, overthrew by the way the 
<A NAME="364"></A>Lacetanians, and taking from them six hundred deserters, caused them all 
<A NAME="365"></A>to be beheaded; upon which Scipio seemed to be in indignation, but Cato, 
<A NAME="366"></A>in mock disparagement of himself, said, "Rome would become great indeed, 
<A NAME="367"></A>if the most honourable and great men would not yield up the first place 
<A NAME="368"></A>of valour to those who were more obscure, and when they who were of the 
<A NAME="369"></A>commonalty (as he himself was) would contend in valour with those who were 
<A NAME="370"></A>most eminent in birth and honour." The senate having voted to change nothing 
<A NAME="371"></A>of what had been established by Cato, the government passed away under 
<A NAME="372"></A>Scipio to no manner of purpose, in idleness and doing nothing; and so diminished 
<A NAME="373"></A>his credit much more than Cato's. Nor did Cato, who now received a triumph, 
<A NAME="374"></A>remit after this and slacken the reins of virtue, as many do, who strive 
<A NAME="375"></A>not so much for virtue's sake, as for vainglory, and having attained the 
<A NAME="376"></A>highest honours, as the consulship and triumphs, pass the rest of their 
<A NAME="377"></A>life in pleasure and idleness, and quit all public affairs. But he, like 
<A NAME="378"></A>those who are just entered upon public life for the first time, and thirst 
<A NAME="379"></A>after gaining honour and glory in some new office, strained himself, as 
<A NAME="380"></A>if he were but just setting out; and offering still publicly his service 
<A NAME="381"></A>to his friends and citizens, would give up neither his pleadings nor his 
<A NAME="382"></A>soldiery.
<A NAME="383"></A><BR><BR>He accompanied and assisted Tiberius Sempronius, as his lieutenant, 
<A NAME="384"></A>when he went into Thrace and to the Danube; and, in the quality of tribune, 
<A NAME="385"></A>went with Manius Acilius into Greece, against Antiochus the Great, who, 
<A NAME="386"></A>after Hannibal, more than any one struck terror into the Romans. For having 
<A NAME="387"></A>reduced once more under a single command almost the whole of Asia, all, 
<A NAME="388"></A>namely, that Seleucus Nicator had possessed, and having brought into obedience 
<A NAME="389"></A>many warlike nations of the barbarians, he longed to fall upon the Romans, 
<A NAME="390"></A>as if they only were now worthy to fight with him. So across he came with 
<A NAME="391"></A>his forces, pretending, as a specious cause of the war, that it was to 
<A NAME="392"></A>free the Greeks, who had indeed no need of it, they having been but newly 
<A NAME="393"></A>delivered from the power of king Philip and the Macedonians, and made independent, 
<A NAME="394"></A>with the free use of their own laws, by the goodness of the Romans themselves: 
<A NAME="395"></A>so that all Greece was in commotion and excitement, having been corrupted 
<A NAME="396"></A>by the hopes of royal aid which the popular leaders in their cities put 
<A NAME="397"></A>them into. Manius, therefore, sent ambassadors to the different cities; 
<A NAME="398"></A>and Titus Flaminius (as is written in the account of him) suppressed and 
<A NAME="399"></A>quieted most of the attempts of the innovators, without any trouble. Cato 
<A NAME="400"></A>brought over the Corinthians, those of Patrae and Aegium, and spent a good 
<A NAME="401"></A>deal of time at Athens. There is also an oration of his said to be extant 
<A NAME="402"></A>which he spoke in Greek to the people; in which he expressed his admiration 
<A NAME="403"></A>of the virtue of the ancient Athenians, and signified that he came with 
<A NAME="404"></A>a great deal of pleasure to be a spectator of the beauty and greatness 
<A NAME="405"></A>of their city. But this is a fiction; for he spoke to the Athenians by 
<A NAME="406"></A>an interpreter, though he was able to have spoken himself; but he wished 
<A NAME="407"></A>to observe the usage of his own country, and laughed at those who admired 
<A NAME="408"></A>nothing but what was in Greek. Jesting upon Postumius Albinus, who had 
<A NAME="409"></A>written an historical work in Greek, and requested that allowances might 
<A NAME="410"></A>be made for his attempt, he said that allowance indeed might be made if 
<A NAME="411"></A>he had done it under the express compulsion of an Amphictyonic decree. 
<A NAME="412"></A>The Athenians, he says, admired the quickness and vehemence of his speech; 
<A NAME="413"></A>for an interpreter would be very long in repeating what he expressed with 
<A NAME="414"></A>a great deal of brevity; but on the whole he professed to believe that 
<A NAME="415"></A>the words of the Greeks came only from their lips, whilst those of the 
<A NAME="416"></A>Romans came from their hearts.
<A NAME="417"></A><BR><BR>Now Antiochus, having occupied with his army the narrow passages 
<A NAME="418"></A>about Thermopylae, and added palisades and walls to the natural fortifications 
<A NAME="419"></A>of the place, sat down there, thinking he had done enough to divert the 
<A NAME="420"></A>war; and the Romans, indeed, seemed wholly to despair of forcing the passage; 
<A NAME="421"></A>but Cato, calling to mind the compass and circuit which the Persians had 
<A NAME="422"></A>formerly made to come at this place, went forth in the night, taking along 
<A NAME="423"></A>with him part of the army. Whilst they were climbing up, the guide, who 
<A NAME="424"></A>was a prisoner, missed the way, and wandering up and down by impracticable 
<A NAME="425"></A>and precipitous paths, filled the soldiers with fear and despondency. Cato, 
<A NAME="426"></A>perceiving the danger, commanded all the rest to halt, and stay where they 
<A NAME="427"></A>were, whilst he himself, taking along with him one Lucius Manlius, a most 
<A NAME="428"></A>expert man at climbing mountains, went forward with a great deal of labour 
<A NAME="429"></A>and danger, in the dark night, and without the least moonshine, among the 
<A NAME="430"></A>wild olive-trees and steep craggy rocks, there being nothing but precipices 
<A NAME="431"></A>and darkness before their eyes, till they struck into a little pass which 
<A NAME="432"></A>they thought might lead down into the enemy's camp. There they put up marks 
<A NAME="433"></A>upon some conspicuous peaks which surmount the hill called Callidromon, 
<A NAME="434"></A>and, returning again, they led the army along with them to the said marks, 
<A NAME="435"></A>till they got into their little path again, and there once made a halt; 
<A NAME="436"></A>but when they began to go further, the path deserted them at a precipice, 
<A NAME="437"></A>where they were in another strait and fear; nor did they perceive that 
<A NAME="438"></A>they were all this while near the enemy. And now the day began to give 
<A NAME="439"></A>some light, when they seemed to hear a noise, and presently after to see 
<A NAME="440"></A>the Greek trenches and the guard at the foot of the rock. Here, therefore, 
<A NAME="441"></A>Cato halted his forces, and commanded the troops from Firmum only, without 
<A NAME="442"></A>the rest, to stick by him, as he had always found them faithful and ready. 
<A NAME="443"></A>And when they came up and formed around him in close order, he thus spoke 
<A NAME="444"></A>to them: "I desire," he said, "to take one of the enemy alive, that so 
<A NAME="445"></A>I may understand what men these are who guard the passage; their number; 
<A NAME="446"></A>and with what discipline, order, and preparation they expect us; but this 
<A NAME="447"></A>feat," continued he, "must be an act of a great deal of quickness and boldness, 
<A NAME="448"></A>such as that of lions, when they dart upon some timorous animal." Cato 
<A NAME="449"></A>had no sooner thus expressed himself, but the Firmans forthwith rushed 
<A NAME="450"></A>down the mountain, just as they were, upon the guard, and, falling unexpectedly 
<A NAME="451"></A>upon them, affrighted and dispersed them all. One armed man they took, 
<A NAME="452"></A>and brought to Cato, who quickly learned from him that the rest of the 
<A NAME="453"></A>forces lay in the narrow passage about the king; that those who kept the 
<A NAME="454"></A>tops of the rocks were six hundred choice Aetolians. Cato, therefore, despising 
<A NAME="455"></A>the smallness of their number and carelessness, forthwith drawing his sword, 
<A NAME="456"></A>fell upon them with a great noise of trumpets and shouting. The enemy, 
<A NAME="457"></A>perceiving them thus tumbling, as it were, upon them from the precipices, 
<A NAME="458"></A>flew to the main body, and put all things into disorder 
<A NAME="459"></A>there.
<A NAME="460"></A><BR><BR>In the meantime, whilst Manius was forcing the works below, and 
<A NAME="461"></A>pouring the thickest of his forces into the narrow passages, Antiochus 
<A NAME="462"></A>was hit in the mouth with a stone, so that his teeth being beaten out by 
<A NAME="463"></A>it, he felt such excessive pain, that he was fain to turn away with his 
<A NAME="464"></A>horse; nor did any part of his army stand the shock of the Romans. Yet, 
<A NAME="465"></A>though there seemed no reasonable hope of flight, where all paths were 
<A NAME="466"></A>so difficult, and where there were deep marshes and steep rocks, which 
<A NAME="467"></A>looked as if they were ready to receive those who should stumble, the fugitives, 
<A NAME="468"></A>nevertheless, crowding and pressing together in the narrow passages, destroyed 
<A NAME="469"></A>even one another in their terror of the swords and blows of the enemy. 
<A NAME="470"></A>Cato (as it plainly appears) was never oversparing of his own praises, 
<A NAME="471"></A>and seldom shunned boasting of any exploit; which quality, indeed, he seems 
<A NAME="472"></A>to have thought the natural accompaniment of great actions; and with these 
<A NAME="473"></A>particular exploits he was highly puffed up; he says that those who saw 
<A NAME="474"></A>him that day pursuing and slaying the enemies were ready to assert that 
<A NAME="475"></A>Cato owed not so much to the public as the public did to Cato; nay, he 
<A NAME="476"></A>adds, that Manius the consul, coming hot from the fight, embraced him for 
<A NAME="477"></A>a great while, when both were all in a sweat; and then cried out with joy 
<A NAME="478"></A>that neither he himself, no, nor all the people together, could make him 
<A NAME="479"></A>a recompense equal to his actions. After the fight he was sent to Rome, 
<A NAME="480"></A>that he himself might be the messenger of it: and so, with a favourable 
<A NAME="481"></A>wind, he sailed to Brundusium, and in one day got from thence to Tarentum; 
<A NAME="482"></A>and having travelled four days more, upon the fifth, counting from the 
<A NAME="483"></A>time of his landing, he arrived at Rome, and so brought the first news 
<A NAME="484"></A>of the victory himself; and filled the whole city with joy and sacrifices, 
<A NAME="485"></A>and the people with the belief that they were able to conquer every sea 
<A NAME="486"></A>and every land.
<A NAME="487"></A><BR><BR>These are pretty nearly all the eminent actions of Cato relating 
<A NAME="488"></A>to military affairs: in civil policy, he was of opinion that one chief 
<A NAME="489"></A>duty consisted in accusing and indicting criminals. He himself prosecuted 
<A NAME="490"></A>many, and he would also assist others who prosecuted them, nay, would even 
<A NAME="491"></A>procure such, as he did the Petilii against Scipio; but not being able 
<A NAME="492"></A>to destroy him, by reason of the nobleness of his family, and the real 
<A NAME="493"></A>greatness of his mind, which enabled him to trample all calumnies under 
<A NAME="494"></A>foot, Cato at last would meddle no more with him; yet joining with the 
<A NAME="495"></A>accusers against Scipio's brother Lucius, he succeeded in obtaining a sentence 
<A NAME="496"></A>against him, which condemned him to the payment of a large sum of money 
<A NAME="497"></A>to the state; and being insolvent, and in danger of being thrown into jail, 
<A NAME="498"></A>he was, by the interposition of the tribunes of the people, with much ado 
<A NAME="499"></A>dismissed. It is also said of Cato, that when he met a certain youth, who 
<A NAME="500"></A>had effected the disgrace of one of his father's enemies, walking in the 
<A NAME="501"></A>market-place, he shook him by the hand, telling him, that this was what 
<A NAME="502"></A>we ought to sacrifice to our dead parents- not lambs and goats, but the 
<A NAME="503"></A>tears and condemnations of their adversaries. But neither did he himself 
<A NAME="504"></A>escape with impunity in his management of affairs; for if he gave his enemies 
<A NAME="505"></A>but the least hold, he was still in danger, and exposed to be brought to 
<A NAME="506"></A>justice. He is reported to have escaped at least fifty indictments; and 
<A NAME="507"></A>one above the rest, which was the last, when he was eighty-six years old, 
<A NAME="508"></A>about which time he uttered the well-known saying, that it was hard for 
<A NAME="509"></A>him who had lived with one generation of men, to plead now before another. 
<A NAME="510"></A>Neither did he make this the least of his lawsuits; for, four years after, 
<A NAME="511"></A>when he was fourscore and ten, he accused Servilius Galba: so that his 
<A NAME="512"></A>life and actions extended, we may say, as Nestor's did, over three ordinary 
<A NAME="513"></A>ages of man. For, having had many contests, as we have related, with Scipio 
<A NAME="514"></A>the Great, about affairs of state, he continued them down to Scipio the 
<A NAME="515"></A>younger, who was the adopted grandson of the former, and the son of that 
<A NAME="516"></A>Paulus who overthrew Perseus and the Macedonians.
<A NAME="517"></A><BR><BR>Ten years after his consulship, Cato stood for the office of censor, 
<A NAME="518"></A>which was indeed the summit of all honour, and in a manner the highest 
<A NAME="519"></A>step in civil affairs; for besides all other power, it had also that of 
<A NAME="520"></A>an inquisition into every one's life and manners. For the Romans thought 
<A NAME="521"></A>that no marriage, or rearing of children, nay, no feast or drinking-bout, 
<A NAME="522"></A>ought to be permitted according to every one's appetite or fancy, without 
<A NAME="523"></A>being examined and inquired into; being indeed of opinion that a man's 
<A NAME="524"></A>character was much sooner perceived in things of this sort than in what 
<A NAME="525"></A>is done publicly and in open day. They chose, therefore, two persons, one 
<A NAME="526"></A>out of the patricians, the other out of the commons, who were to watch, 
<A NAME="527"></A>correct, and punish, if any one ran too much into voluptuousness, or transgressed 
<A NAME="528"></A>the usual manner of life of his country; and these they called Censors. 
<A NAME="529"></A>They had power to take away a horse, or expel out of the senate any one 
<A NAME="530"></A>who lived intemperately and out of order. It was also their business to 
<A NAME="531"></A>take an estimate of what every one was worth, and to put down in registers 
<A NAME="532"></A>everybody's birth and quality; besides many other prerogatives. And therefore 
<A NAME="533"></A>the chief nobility opposed his pretensions to it. Jealousy prompted the 
<A NAME="534"></A>patricians, who thought that it would be a stain to everybody's nobility, 
<A NAME="535"></A>if men of no original honour should rise to the highest dignity and power; 
<A NAME="536"></A>while others, conscious of their own evil practices, and of the violation 
<A NAME="537"></A>of the laws and customs of their country, were afraid of the austerity 
<A NAME="538"></A>of the man; which, in an office of such great power, was likely to prove 
<A NAME="539"></A>most uncompromising and severe. And so, consulting among themselves, they 
<A NAME="540"></A>brought forward seven candidates in opposition to him, who sedulously set 
<A NAME="541"></A>themselves to court the people's favour by fair promises, as though what 
<A NAME="542"></A>they wished for was indulgent and easy government. Cato, on the contrary, 
<A NAME="543"></A>promising no such mildness, but plainly threatening evil livers, from the 
<A NAME="544"></A>very hustings openly declared himself, and exclaiming that the city needed 
<A NAME="545"></A>a great and thorough purgation, called upon the people, if they were wise, 
<A NAME="546"></A>not to choose the gentlest, but the roughest of physicians; such a one, 
<A NAME="547"></A>he said, he was, and Valerius Flaccus, one of the patricians, another; 
<A NAME="548"></A>together with him, he doubted not but he should do something worth the 
<A NAME="549"></A>while, and that by cutting to pieces and burning like a hydra all luxury 
<A NAME="550"></A>and voluptuousness. He added, too, that he saw all the rest endeavouring 
<A NAME="551"></A>after the office with ill intent, because they were afraid of those who 
<A NAME="552"></A>would exercise it justly, as they ought. And so truly great and so worthy 
<A NAME="553"></A>of great men to be its leaders was, it would seem the Roman people, that 
<A NAME="554"></A>they did not fear the severity and grim countenance of Cato, but rejecting 
<A NAME="555"></A>those smooth promisers who were ready to do all things to ingratiate themselves, 
<A NAME="556"></A>they took him, together with Flaccus; obeying his recommendations not as 
<A NAME="557"></A>though he were a candidate, but as if he had had the actual power of commanding 
<A NAME="558"></A>and governing already.
<A NAME="559"></A><BR><BR>Cato named, as chief of the senate, his friend and colleague Lucius 
<A NAME="560"></A>Valerius Flaccus, and expelled, among many others, Lucius Quintius, who 
<A NAME="561"></A>had been consul seven years before, and (which was greater honour to him 
<A NAME="562"></A>than the consulship) brother to that Titus Flaminius who overthrew King 
<A NAME="563"></A>Philip. The reason he had for his expulsion was this. Lucius, it seems, 
<A NAME="564"></A>took along with him in all his commands a youth whom he had kept as his 
<A NAME="565"></A>companion from the flower of his age, and to whom he gave as much power 
<A NAME="566"></A>and respect as to the chiefest of his friends and relations.
<A NAME="567"></A><BR><BR>Now it happened that Lucius being consular governor of one of the 
<A NAME="568"></A>provinces, the youth setting himself down by him, as he used to do, among 
<A NAME="569"></A>other flatteries with which he played upon him, when he was in his cups, 
<A NAME="570"></A>told him he loved him so dearly that, "though there was a show of gladiators 
<A NAME="571"></A>to be seen at Rome, and I," he said, "had never beheld one in my life; 
<A NAME="572"></A>and though I, as it were, longed to see a man killed, yet I made all possible 
<A NAME="573"></A>haste to come to you." Upon this Lucius, returning his fondness, replied, 
<A NAME="574"></A>"Do not be melancholy on that account; I can remedy that." Ordering therefore, 
<A NAME="575"></A>forthwith, one of those condemned to die to be brought to the feast, together 
<A NAME="576"></A>with the headsman and axe, he asked the youth if he wished to see him executed. 
<A NAME="577"></A>The boy answering that he did, Lucius commanded the executioner to cut 
<A NAME="578"></A>off his neck; and this several historians mention; and Cicero, indeed, 
<A NAME="579"></A>in his dialogue de Senectute, introduces Cato relating it himself. But 
<A NAME="580"></A>Livy says that he that was killed was a Gaulish deserter, and that Lucius 
<A NAME="581"></A>did not execute him by the stroke of the executioner, but with his own 
<A NAME="582"></A>hand; and that it is so stated in Cato's speech.
<A NAME="583"></A><BR><BR>Lucius being thus expelled out of the senate by Cato, his brother 
<A NAME="584"></A>took it very ill, and appealing to the people, desired that Cato should 
<A NAME="585"></A>declare his reasons; and when he began to relate this transaction of the 
<A NAME="586"></A>feast, Lucius endeavoured to deny it; but Cato challenging him to a formal 
<A NAME="587"></A>investigation, he fell off and refused it, so that he was then acknowledged 
<A NAME="588"></A>to suffer deservedly. Afterwards, however, when there was some show at 
<A NAME="589"></A>the theatre, he passed by the seats where those who had been consuls used 
<A NAME="590"></A>to be placed, and taking his seat a great way off, excited the compassion 
<A NAME="591"></A>of the common people, who presently with a great noise made him go forward, 
<A NAME="592"></A>and as much as they could tried to set right and salve over what had happened. 
<A NAME="593"></A>Manilius, also, who, according to the public expectation, would have been 
<A NAME="594"></A>next consul, he threw out of the senate, because, in the presence of his 
<A NAME="595"></A>daughter, and in open day, he had kissed his wife. He said that, as for 
<A NAME="596"></A>himself, his wife never came into his arms except when there was great 
<A NAME="597"></A>thunder; so that it was for jest with him, that it was a pleasure for him, 
<A NAME="598"></A>when Jupiter thundered.
<A NAME="599"></A><BR><BR>His treatment of Lucius, likewise the brother of Scipio, and one 
<A NAME="600"></A>who had been honoured with a triumph, occasioned some odium against Cato; 
<A NAME="601"></A>for he took his horse from him, and was thought to do it with a design 
<A NAME="602"></A>of putting an affront on Scipio Africanus, now dead. But he gave most general 
<A NAME="603"></A>annoyance by retrenching people's luxury; for though (most of the youth 
<A NAME="604"></A>being thereby already corrupted) it seemed almost impossible to take it 
<A NAME="605"></A>away with an open hand and directly, yet going, as it were, obliquely around, 
<A NAME="606"></A>he caused all dress, carriages, women's ornaments, household furniture, 
<A NAME="607"></A>whose price exceeded one thousand five hundred drachmas, to be rated at 
<A NAME="608"></A>ten times as much as they were worth; intending by thus making the assessments 
<A NAME="609"></A>greater, to increase the taxes paid upon them. He also ordained that upon 
<A NAME="610"></A>every thousand asses of property of this kind, three should be paid, so 
<A NAME="611"></A>that people, burdened with these extra charges, and seeing others of as 
<A NAME="612"></A>good estates, but more frugal and sparing, paying less into the public 
<A NAME="613"></A>exchequer, might be tried out of their prodigality. And thus, on the one 
<A NAME="614"></A>side, not only those were disgusted at Cato who bore the taxes for the 
<A NAME="615"></A>sake of their luxury, but those, too, who on the other side laid by their 
<A NAME="616"></A>luxury for fear of the taxes. For people in general reckon that an order 
<A NAME="617"></A>not to display their riches is equivalent to the taking away of their riches, 
<A NAME="618"></A>because riches are seen much more in superfluous than in necessary things. 
<A NAME="619"></A>Indeed this was what excited the wonder of Ariston the philosopher; that 
<A NAME="620"></A>we account those who possess superfluous things more happy than those who 
<A NAME="621"></A>abound with what is necessary and useful. But when one of his friends asked 
<A NAME="622"></A>Scopas, the rich Thessalian, to give him some article of no great utility, 
<A NAME="623"></A>saying that it was not a thing that he had any great need or use for himself, 
<A NAME="624"></A>"In truth," replied he, "it is just these useless and unnecessary things 
<A NAME="625"></A>that make my wealth and happiness." Thus the desire of riches does not 
<A NAME="626"></A>proceed from a natural passion within us, but arises rather from vulgar 
<A NAME="627"></A>out-of-doors opinion of other people.
<A NAME="628"></A><BR><BR>Cato, notwithstanding, being little solicitous as to those who 
<A NAME="629"></A>exclaimed against him, increased his austerity. He caused the pipes, through 
<A NAME="630"></A>which some persons brought the public water into their houses and gardens, 
<A NAME="631"></A>to be cut, and threw down all buildings which jutted out into the common 
<A NAME="632"></A>streets. He beat down also the price in contracts for public works to the 
<A NAME="633"></A>lowest, and raised it in contracts for farming the taxes to the highest 
<A NAME="634"></A>sum; by which proceedings he drew a great deal of hatred upon himself. 
<A NAME="635"></A>Those who were of Titus Flaminius's party cancelled in the senate all the 
<A NAME="636"></A>bargains and contracts made by him for the repairing and carrying on of 
<A NAME="637"></A>the sacred and public buildings as unadvantageous to the commonwealth. 
<A NAME="638"></A>They incited also the boldest of the tribunes of the people to accuse him 
<A NAME="639"></A>and to fine him two talents. They likewise much opposed him in building 
<A NAME="640"></A>the court or basilica, which he caused to be erected at the common charge, 
<A NAME="641"></A>just by the senate-house, in the market-place, and called by his own name, 
<A NAME="642"></A>the Porcian. However, the people, it seems, liked his censorship wondrously 
<A NAME="643"></A>well; for, setting up a statue for him in the temple of the goddess of 
<A NAME="644"></A>Health, they put an inscription under it, not recording his commands in 
<A NAME="645"></A>war or his triumph, but to the effect that this was Cato the Censor, who, 
<A NAME="646"></A>by his good discipline and wise and temperate ordinances, reclaimed the 
<A NAME="647"></A>Roman commonwealth when it was declining and sinking down into vice. Before 
<A NAME="648"></A>this honour was done to himself, he used to laugh at those who loved such 
<A NAME="649"></A>kind of things, saying, that they did not see that they were taking pride 
<A NAME="650"></A>in the workmanship of brass-founders and painters; whereas the citizens 
<A NAME="651"></A>bore about his best likeness in their breasts. And when any seemed to wonder 
<A NAME="652"></A>that he should have never a statue, while many ordinary persons had one, 
<A NAME="653"></A>"I would," said he, "much rather be asked, why I have not one, than why 
<A NAME="654"></A>I have one." In short, he would not have any honest citizen endure to be 
<A NAME="655"></A>praised, except it might prove advantageous to the commonwealth. Yet still 
<A NAME="656"></A>he had passed the highest commendation on himself; for he tells us that 
<A NAME="657"></A>those who did anything wrong, and were found fault with, used to say it 
<A NAME="658"></A>was not worth while to blame them, for they were not Catos. He also adds, 
<A NAME="659"></A>that they who awkwardly mimicked some of his actions were called left-handed 
<A NAME="660"></A>Catos; and that the senate in perilous times would cast their eyes on him, 
<A NAME="661"></A>as upon a pilot in a ship, and that often when he was not present they 
<A NAME="662"></A>put off affairs of greatest consequence. These things are indeed also testified 
<A NAME="663"></A>of him by others; for he had a great authority in the city, alike for his 
<A NAME="664"></A>life, his eloquence, and his age.
<A NAME="665"></A><BR><BR>He was also a good father, an excellent husband to his wife, and 
<A NAME="666"></A>an extraordinary economist; and as he did not manage his affairs of this 
<A NAME="667"></A>kind carelessly, and as things of little moment, I think I ought to record 
<A NAME="668"></A>a little further whatever was commendable in him in these points. He married 
<A NAME="669"></A>a wife more noble than rich; being of opinion that the rich and the high-born 
<A NAME="670"></A>are equally haughty and proud; but that those of noble blood would be more 
<A NAME="671"></A>ashamed of base things, and consequently more obedient to their husbands 
<A NAME="672"></A>in all that was fit and right. A man who beat his wife or child laid violent 
<A NAME="673"></A>hands, he said, on what was most sacred; and a good husband he reckoned 
<A NAME="674"></A>worthy of more praise than a great senator; and he admired the ancient 
<A NAME="675"></A>Socrates for nothing so much as for having lived a temperate and contented 
<A NAME="676"></A>life with a wife who was a scold, and children who were 
<A NAME="677"></A>half-witted.
<A NAME="678"></A><BR><BR>As soon as he had a son born, though he had never such urgent business 
<A NAME="679"></A>upon his hands, unless it were some public matter, he would be by when 
<A NAME="680"></A>his wife washed it and dressed it in its swaddling clothes. For she herself 
<A NAME="681"></A>suckled it, nay, she often too gave her breast to her servants' children, 
<A NAME="682"></A>to produce, by suckling the same milk, a kind of natural love in them to 
<A NAME="683"></A>her son. When he began to come to years of discretion, Cato himself would 
<A NAME="684"></A>teach him to read, although he had a servant, a very good grammarian, called 
<A NAME="685"></A>Chilo, who taught many others; but he thought not fit, as he himself said, 
<A NAME="686"></A>to have his son reprimanded by a slave, or pulled, it may be, by the ears 
<A NAME="687"></A>when found tardy in his lesson: nor would he have him owe to a servant 
<A NAME="688"></A>the obligation of so great a thing as his learning; he himself, therefore 
<A NAME="689"></A>(as we were saying), taught him his grammar, law, and his gymnastic exercises. 
<A NAME="690"></A>Nor did he only show him, too, how to throw a dart, to fight in armour, 
<A NAME="691"></A>and to ride, but to box also and to endure both heat and cold, and to swim 
<A NAME="692"></A>over the most rapid and rough rivers. He says, likewise, that he wrote 
<A NAME="693"></A>histories, in large characters, with his own hand, that so his son, without 
<A NAME="694"></A>stirring out of the house, might learn to know about his countrymen and 
<A NAME="695"></A>forefathers; nor did he less abstain from speaking anything obscene before 
<A NAME="696"></A>his son, than if it had been in the presence of the sacred virgins, called 
<A NAME="697"></A>vestals. Nor would he ever go into the bath with him; which seems indeed 
<A NAME="698"></A>to have been the common custom of the Romans. Sons-in-law used to avoid 
<A NAME="699"></A>bathing with fathers-in-law, disliking to see one another naked; but having, 
<A NAME="700"></A>in time, learned of the Greeks to strip before men, they have since taught 
<A NAME="701"></A>the Greeks to do it even with the women themselves.
<A NAME="702"></A><BR><BR>Thus, like an excellent work, Cato formed and fashioned his son 
<A NAME="703"></A>to virtue; nor had he any occasion to find fault with his readiness and 
<A NAME="704"></A>docility; but as he proved to be of too weak a constitution for hardships, 
<A NAME="705"></A>he did not insist on requiring of him any very austere way of living. However, 
<A NAME="706"></A>though delicate in health, he proved a stout man in the field, and behaved 
<A NAME="707"></A>himself valiantly when Paulus Aemilius fought against Perseus; where when 
<A NAME="708"></A>his sword was struck from him by a blow, or rather slipped out of his hand 
<A NAME="709"></A>by reason of its moistness, he so keenly resented it, that he turned to 
<A NAME="710"></A>some of his friends about him, and taking them along with him again fell 
<A NAME="711"></A>upon the enemy; and having by a long fight and much force cleared the place, 
<A NAME="712"></A>at length found it among great heaps of arms, and the dead bodies of friends 
<A NAME="713"></A>as well as enemies piled one upon another. Upon which Paulus, his general, 
<A NAME="714"></A>much commended the youth; and there is a letter of Cato's to his son, which 
<A NAME="715"></A>highly praised his honourable eagerness for the recovery of his sword. 
<A NAME="716"></A>Afterwards he married Tertia, Aemilius Paulus's daughter, and sister to 
<A NAME="717"></A>Scipio; nor was he admitted into this family less for his own worth than 
<A NAME="718"></A>his father's. So that Cato's care in his son's education came to a very 
<A NAME="719"></A>fitting result.
<A NAME="720"></A><BR><BR>He purchased a great many slaves out of the captives taken in war, 
<A NAME="721"></A>but chiefly brought up the young ones, who were capable to be, as it were, 
<A NAME="722"></A>broken and taught like whelps and colts. None of these ever entered another 
<A NAME="723"></A>man's house, except sent either by Cato himself or his wife. If any one 
<A NAME="724"></A>of them were asked what Cato did, they answered merely that they did not 
<A NAME="725"></A>know. When a servant was at home, he was obliged either to do some work 
<A NAME="726"></A>or sleep, for indeed Cato loved those most who used to lie down often to 
<A NAME="727"></A>sleep, accounting them more docile than those who were wakeful, and more 
<A NAME="728"></A>fit for anything when they were refreshed with a little slumber. Being 
<A NAME="729"></A>also of opinion that the great cause of the laziness and misbehaviour of 
<A NAME="730"></A>slaves was their running after their pleasures, he fixed a certain price 
<A NAME="731"></A>for them to pay for permission amongst themselves, but would suffer no 
<A NAME="732"></A>connections out of the house. At first, when he was but a poor soldier, 
<A NAME="733"></A>he would not be difficult in anything which related to his eating, but 
<A NAME="734"></A>looked upon it as a pitiful thing to quarrel with a servant for the belly's 
<A NAME="735"></A>sake; but afterwards, when he grew richer, and made any feasts for his 
<A NAME="736"></A>friends and colleagues in office, as soon as supper was over he used to 
<A NAME="737"></A>go with a leather thong and scourge those who had waited or dressed the 
<A NAME="738"></A>meat carelessly. He always contrived, too, that his servants should have 
<A NAME="739"></A>some difference one among another, always suspecting and fearing a good 
<A NAME="740"></A>understanding between them. Those who had committed anything worthy of 
<A NAME="741"></A>death, he punished if they were found guilty by the verdict of their fellow-servants. 
<A NAME="742"></A>But being after all much given to the desire of gain, he looked upon agriculture 
<A NAME="743"></A>rather as a pleasure than profit; resolving, therefore, to lay out his 
<A NAME="744"></A>money in safe and solid things, he purchased ponds, hot baths, grounds 
<A NAME="745"></A>full of fuller's earth, remunerative lands, pastures, and woods; from all 
<A NAME="746"></A>which he drew large returns, nor could Jupiter himself, he used to say, 
<A NAME="747"></A>do him much damage. He was also given to the form of usury, which is considered 
<A NAME="748"></A>most odious, in traffic by sea; and that thus:- he desired that those whom 
<A NAME="749"></A>he put out his money to should have many partners; when the number of them 
<A NAME="750"></A>and their ships came to be fifty, he himself took one share through Quintio 
<A NAME="751"></A>his freedman, who therefore was to sail with the adventurers, and take 
<A NAME="752"></A>a part in all their proceedings, so that thus there was no danger of losing 
<A NAME="753"></A>his whole stock, but only a little part, and that with a prospect of great 
<A NAME="754"></A>profit. He likewise lent money to those of his slaves who wished to borrow, 
<A NAME="755"></A>with which they bought also other young ones, whom, when they had taught 
<A NAME="756"></A>and bred up at his charges, they would sell again at the year's end; but 
<A NAME="757"></A>some of them Cato would keep for himself, giving just as much for them 
<A NAME="758"></A>as another had offered. To incline his son to be of his kind or temper, 
<A NAME="759"></A>he used to tell him that it was not like a man, but rather like a widow 
<A NAME="760"></A>woman, to lessen an estate, But the strongest indication of Cato's avaricious 
<A NAME="761"></A>humour was when he took the boldness to affirm that he was a most wonderful, 
<A NAME="762"></A>nay, a godlike man, who left more behind him than he had 
<A NAME="763"></A>received.
<A NAME="764"></A><BR><BR>He was now grown old, when Carneades the Academic, and Diogenes 
<A NAME="765"></A>the Stoic, came as deputies from Athens to Rome, praying for release from 
<A NAME="766"></A>a penalty of five hundred talents laid on the Athenians, in a suit, to 
<A NAME="767"></A>which they did not appear, in which the Oropians were plaintiffs and Sicyonians 
<A NAME="768"></A>judges. All the most studious youth immediately waited on these philosophers, 
<A NAME="769"></A>and frequently, with admiration, heard them speak. But the gracefulness 
<A NAME="770"></A>of Carneades's oratory, whose ability was really greatest, and his reputation 
<A NAME="771"></A>equal to it, gathered large and favourable audiences, and ere long filled, 
<A NAME="772"></A>like a wind, all the city with the sound of it. So that it soon began to 
<A NAME="773"></A>be told that a Greek, famous even to admiration, winning and carrying all 
<A NAME="774"></A>before him, had impressed so strange a love upon the young men, that quitting 
<A NAME="775"></A>all their pleasures and pastimes, they ran mad, as it were, after philosophy; 
<A NAME="776"></A>which indeed much pleased the Romans in general; nor could they but with 
<A NAME="777"></A>much pleasure see the youth receive so welcomely the Greek literature, 
<A NAME="778"></A>and frequent the company of learned men. But Cato, on the other side, seeing 
<A NAME="779"></A>the passion for words flowing into the city, from the beginning took it 
<A NAME="780"></A>ill, fearing lest the youth should be diverted that way, and so should 
<A NAME="781"></A>prefer the glory of speaking well before that of arms and doing well. And 
<A NAME="782"></A>when the fame of the philosophers increased in the city, and Caius Acilius, 
<A NAME="783"></A>a person of distinction, at his own request, became their interpreter to 
<A NAME="784"></A>the senate at their first audience, Cato resolved, under some specious 
<A NAME="785"></A>pretence, to have all philosophers cleared out of the city; and, coming 
<A NAME="786"></A>into the senate, blamed the magistrates for letting these deputies stay 
<A NAME="787"></A>so long a time without being despatched, though they were persons that 
<A NAME="788"></A>could easily persuade the people to what they pleased; that therefore in 
<A NAME="789"></A>all haste something should be determined about their petition, that so 
<A NAME="790"></A>they might go home again to their own schools, and declaim to the Greek 
<A NAME="791"></A>children, and leave the Roman youth to be obedient, as hitherto, to their 
<A NAME="792"></A>own laws and governors.
<A NAME="793"></A><BR><BR>Yet he did this not out of any anger, as some think, to Carneades; 
<A NAME="794"></A>but because he wholly despised philosophy, and out of a kind of pride scoffed 
<A NAME="795"></A>at the Greek studies and literature; as, for example, he would say, that 
<A NAME="796"></A>Socrates was a prating, seditious fellow, who did his best to tyrannize 
<A NAME="797"></A>over his country, to undermine the ancient customs, and to entice and withdraw 
<A NAME="798"></A>the citizens to opinions contrary to the laws. Ridiculing the school of 
<A NAME="799"></A>Isocrates, he would add, that his scholars grew old men before they had 
<A NAME="800"></A>done learning with him, as if they were to use their art and plead causes 
<A NAME="801"></A>in the court of Minos in the next world. And to frighten his son from anything 
<A NAME="802"></A>that was Greek, in a more vehement tone than became one of his age, he 
<A NAME="803"></A>pronounced, as it were, with the voice of an oracle, that the Romans would 
<A NAME="804"></A>certainly be destroyed when they began once to be infected with Greek literature; 
<A NAME="805"></A>though time indeed has shown the vanity of this his prophecy; as, in truth, 
<A NAME="806"></A>the city of Rome has risen to its highest fortune while entertaining Grecian 
<A NAME="807"></A>learning. Nor had he an aversion only against the Greek philosophers, but 
<A NAME="808"></A>the physicians also; for having, it seems, heard how Hippocrates, when 
<A NAME="809"></A>the king of Persia sent for him, with offers of a fee of several talents, 
<A NAME="810"></A>said, that he would never assist barbarians who were enemies to the Greeks; 
<A NAME="811"></A>he affirmed, that this was now become a common oath taken by all physicians, 
<A NAME="812"></A>and enjoined his son to have a care and avoid them; for that he himself 
<A NAME="813"></A>had written a little book of prescriptions for curing those who were sick 
<A NAME="814"></A>in his family; he never enjoined fasting to any one, but ordered them either 
<A NAME="815"></A>vegetables, or the meat of a duck, pigeon, or leveret; such kind of diet 
<A NAME="816"></A>being of light digestion and fit for sick folks, only it made those who 
<A NAME="817"></A>ate it dream a little too much; and by the use of this kind of physic, 
<A NAME="818"></A>he said, he not only made himself and those about him well, but kept them 
<A NAME="819"></A>so.
<A NAME="820"></A><BR><BR>However, for this his presumption he seemed not to have escaped 
<A NAME="821"></A>unpunished; for he lost both his wife and his son; though he himself, being 
<A NAME="822"></A>of a strong, robust constitution, held out longer; so that he would often, 
<A NAME="823"></A>even in his old days, address himself to women, and when he was past a 
<A NAME="824"></A>lover's age, married a young woman, upon the following pretence: Having 
<A NAME="825"></A>lost his own wife, he married his son to the daughter of Paulus Aemilius, 
<A NAME="826"></A>who was sister to Scipio; so that being now a widower himself, he had a 
<A NAME="827"></A>young girl who came privately to visit him, but the house being very small, 
<A NAME="828"></A>and a daughter-in-law also in it, this practice was quickly discovered; 
<A NAME="829"></A>for the young woman seeming once to pass through it a little too boldly, 
<A NAME="830"></A>the youth, his son, though he said nothing, seemed to look somewhat indignantly 
<A NAME="831"></A>upon her. The old man perceiving and understanding that what he did was 
<A NAME="832"></A>disliked, without finding any fault or saying a word, went away, as his 
<A NAME="833"></A>custom was, with his usual companions to the market: and among the rest, 
<A NAME="834"></A>he called aloud to one Salonius, who had been a clerk under him, and asked 
<A NAME="835"></A>him whether he had married his daughter? He answered no, nor would he, 
<A NAME="836"></A>till he had consulted him. Said Cato, "Then I have found out a fit son-in-law 
<A NAME="837"></A>for you, if he should not displease by reason of his age; for in all other 
<A NAME="838"></A>points there is no fault to be found in him; but he is indeed, as I said, 
<A NAME="839"></A>extremely old." However, Salonius desired him to undertake the business, 
<A NAME="840"></A>and to give the young girl to whom he pleased, she being a humble servant 
<A NAME="841"></A>of his, who stood in need of his care and patronage. Upon this Cato, without 
<A NAME="842"></A>any more ado, told him he desired to have the damsel himself. These words, 
<A NAME="843"></A>as may well be imagined, at first astonished the man, conceiving that Cato 
<A NAME="844"></A>was as far off from marrying, as he from a likelihood of being allied to 
<A NAME="845"></A>the family of one who had been consul and had triumphed; but perceiving 
<A NAME="846"></A>him in earnest, he consented willingly; and going onwards to the forum, 
<A NAME="847"></A>they quickly completed the bargain.
<A NAME="848"></A><BR><BR>Whilst the marriage was in hand, Cato's son, taking some of his 
<A NAME="849"></A>friends along with him, went and asked his father if it were for any offence 
<A NAME="850"></A>he brought in a stepmother upon him? But Cato cried out, "Far from it, 
<A NAME="851"></A>my son, I have no fault to find with you or anything of yours; only I desire 
<A NAME="852"></A>to have many children, and to leave the commonwealth more such citizens 
<A NAME="853"></A>as you are." Pisistratus, the tyrant of Athens, made, they say, this answer 
<A NAME="854"></A>to his sons, when they were grown men, when he married his second wife, 
<A NAME="855"></A>Timonassa of Argos, by whom he had, it is said, Iophon and Thessalus. Cato 
<A NAME="856"></A>had a son by this second wife, to whom, from his mother, he gave the surname 
<A NAME="857"></A>of Salonius. In the meantime, his eldest died in his praetorship; of whom 
<A NAME="858"></A>Cato often makes mention in his books, as having been a good man. He is 
<A NAME="859"></A>said, however, to have borne the loss moderately and like a philosopher, 
<A NAME="860"></A>and was nothing the more remiss in attending to affairs of state; so that 
<A NAME="861"></A>he did not, as Lucius Lucullus and Metellus Pius did, grow languid in his 
<A NAME="862"></A>old age, as though public business were a duty once to be discharged, and 
<A NAME="863"></A>then quitted; nor did he, like Scipio Africanus, because envy had struck 
<A NAME="864"></A>at his glory, turn from the public, and change and pass away the rest of 
<A NAME="865"></A>his life without doing anything; but as one persuaded Dionysius, that the 
<A NAME="866"></A>most honourable tomb he could have would be to die in the exercise of his 
<A NAME="867"></A>dominion; so Cato thought that old age to be the most honourable which 
<A NAME="868"></A>was busied in public affairs; though he would, now and then, when he had 
<A NAME="869"></A>leisure, recreate himself with husbandry and writing.
<A NAME="870"></A><BR><BR>And, indeed, he composed various books and histories; and in his 
<A NAME="871"></A>youth he addicted himself to agriculture for profit's sake; for he used 
<A NAME="872"></A>to say he had but two ways of getting- agriculture and parsimony; and now, 
<A NAME="873"></A>in his old age, the first of these gave him both occupation and a subject 
<A NAME="874"></A>of study. He wrote one book on country matters, in which he treated particularly 
<A NAME="875"></A>even of making cakes and preserving fruit; it being his ambition to be 
<A NAME="876"></A>curious and singular in all things. His suppers, at his country house, 
<A NAME="877"></A>used also to be plentiful; he daily invited his friends and neighbours 
<A NAME="878"></A>about him, and passed the time merrily with them; so that his company was 
<A NAME="879"></A>not only agreeable to those of the same age, but even to younger men; for 
<A NAME="880"></A>he had had experience in many things, and had been concerned in much, both 
<A NAME="881"></A>by word and deed, that was worth the hearing. He looked upon a good table 
<A NAME="882"></A>as the best place for making friends; where the commendations of brave 
<A NAME="883"></A>and good citizens were usually introduced, and little said of base and 
<A NAME="884"></A>unworthy ones; as Cato would not give leave in his company to have anything, 
<A NAME="885"></A>either good or ill, said about them.
<A NAME="886"></A><BR><BR>Some will have the overthrow of Carthage to have been one of his 
<A NAME="887"></A>last acts of state; when, indeed, Scipio the younger did by his valour 
<A NAME="888"></A>give it the last blow, but the war, chiefly by the counsel and advice of 
<A NAME="889"></A>Cato, was undertaken on the following occasion. Cato was sent to the Carthaginians 
<A NAME="890"></A>and Masinissa, King of Numidia, who were at war with one another, to know 
<A NAME="891"></A>the cause of their difference. He, it seems, had been a friend of the Romans 
<A NAME="892"></A>from the beginning; and they, too, since they were conquered by Scipio, 
<A NAME="893"></A>were of the Roman confederacy, having been shorn of their power by loss 
<A NAME="894"></A>of territory and a heavy tax. Finding Carthage, not (as the Romans thought) 
<A NAME="895"></A>low and in an ill condition, but well manned, full of riches and all sorts 
<A NAME="896"></A>of arms and ammunition, and perceiving the Carthaginians carry it high, 
<A NAME="897"></A>he conceived that it was not a time for the Romans to adjust affairs between 
<A NAME="898"></A>them and Masinissa; but rather that they themselves would fall into danger, 
<A NAME="899"></A>unless they should find means to check this rapid new growth of Rome's 
<A NAME="900"></A>ancient irreconcilable enemy. Therefore, returning quickly to Rome, he 
<A NAME="901"></A>acquainted the senate that the former defeats and blows given to the Carthaginians 
<A NAME="902"></A>had not so much diminished their strength, as it had abated their imprudence 
<A NAME="903"></A>and folly; that they were not become weaker, but more experienced in war, 
<A NAME="904"></A>and did only skirmish with the Numidians to exercise themselves the better 
<A NAME="905"></A>to cope with the Romans: that the peace and league they had made was but 
<A NAME="906"></A>a kind of suspension of war which awaited a fairer opportunity to break 
<A NAME="907"></A>out again.
<A NAME="908"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, they say that, shaking his gown, he took occasion to 
<A NAME="909"></A>let drop some African figs before the senate. And on their admiring the 
<A NAME="910"></A>size and beauty of them, he presently added, that the place that bore them 
<A NAME="911"></A>was but three days' sail from Rome. Nay, he never after this gave his opinion, 
<A NAME="912"></A>but at the end he would be sure to come out with this sentence, "ALSO, 
<A NAME="913"></A>CARTHAGE, METHINKS, OUGHT UTTERLY TO BE Destroyed." But Publius Scipio 
<A NAME="914"></A>Nasica would always declare his opinion to the contrary, in these words, 
<A NAME="915"></A>"It seems requisite to me that Carthage should still stand." For seeing 
<A NAME="916"></A>his countrymen to be grown wanton and insolent, and the people made, by 
<A NAME="917"></A>their prosperity, obstinate and disobedient to the senate, and drawing 
<A NAME="918"></A>the whole city, whither they would, after them, he would have had the fear 
<A NAME="919"></A>of Carthage to serve as a bit to hold the contumacy of the multitude; and 
<A NAME="920"></A>he looked upon the Carthaginians as too weak to overcome the Romans, and 
<A NAME="921"></A>too great to be despised by them. On the other side, it seemed a perilous 
<A NAME="922"></A>thing to Cato that a city which had been always great, and was now grown 
<A NAME="923"></A>sober and wise, by reason of its former calamities, should still lie, as 
<A NAME="924"></A>it were, in wait for the follies and dangerous excesses of the over-powerful 
<A NAME="925"></A>Roman people; so that he thought it the wisest course to have all outward 
<A NAME="926"></A>dangers removed, when they had so many inward ones among 
<A NAME="927"></A>themselves.
<A NAME="928"></A><BR><BR>Thus Cato, they say, stirred up the third and last war against 
<A NAME="929"></A>the Carthaginians: but no sooner was the said war begun, than he died, 
<A NAME="930"></A>prophesying of the person that should put an end to it who was then only 
<A NAME="931"></A>a young man; but, being tribune in the army, he in several fights gave 
<A NAME="932"></A>proof of his courage and conduct. The news of which being brought to Cato's 
<A NAME="933"></A>ears at Rome, he thus expressed himself:-
<A NAME="934"></A><BR><BR>"The only wise man of them all is he,
<A NAME="935"></A><BR>The others e'en as shadows flit and flee." This prophecy Scipio soon 
<A NAME="936"></A>confirmed by his actions.
<A NAME="937"></A><BR><BR>Cato left no posterity, except one son by his second wife, who 
<A NAME="938"></A>was named, as we said, Cato Salonius; and a grandson by his eldest son, 
<A NAME="939"></A>who died. Cato Salonius died when he was praetor, but his son Marcus was 
<A NAME="940"></A>afterwards consul, and he was grandfather of Cato the philosopher, who 
<A NAME="941"></A>for virtue and renown was one of the most eminent personages of his 
<A NAME="942"></A>time.
