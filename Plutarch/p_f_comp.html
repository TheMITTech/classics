<A NAME="2"></A><BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>First them, as for the greatness of the benefits which Titus conferred 
<A NAME="11"></A>on Greece, neither Philopoemen, nor many braver men than he, can make good 
<A NAME="12"></A>the parallel. They were Greeks fighting against Greeks, but Titus, a stranger 
<A NAME="13"></A>to Greece, fought for her. And at the very time when Philopoemen went over 
<A NAME="14"></A>into Crete, destitute of means to succour his besieged countrymen, Titus, 
<A NAME="15"></A>by a defeat given to Philip in the heart of Greece, set them and their 
<A NAME="16"></A>cities free. Again, if we examine the battles they fought, Philopoemen, 
<A NAME="17"></A>whilst he was the Achaeans' general, slew more Greeks than Titus, in aiding 
<A NAME="18"></A>the Greeks, slew Macedonians. As to their failings, ambition was Titus's 
<A NAME="19"></A>weak side, and obstinacy Philopoemen's in the former, anger was easily 
<A NAME="20"></A>kindled; in the latter, it was as hardly quenched. Titus reserved to Philip 
<A NAME="21"></A>the royal dignity; he pardoned the Aetolians, and stood their friend; but 
<A NAME="22"></A>Philopoemen, exasperated against his country, deprived it of its supremacy 
<A NAME="23"></A>over the adjacent villages. Titus was ever constant to those he had once 
<A NAME="24"></A>befriended; the other, upon any offence, as prone to cancel kindnesses. 
<A NAME="25"></A>He who had once been a benefactor to the Lacedaemonians, afterwards laid 
<A NAME="26"></A>their walls level with the ground, wasted their country, and in the end 
<A NAME="27"></A>changed and destroyed the whole frame of their government. He seems, in 
<A NAME="28"></A>truth, to have prodigalled away his own life, through passion and perverseness; 
<A NAME="29"></A>for he fell upon the Messenians, not with that conduct and caution that 
<A NAME="30"></A>characterized the movements of Titus, but with unnecessary and unreasonable 
<A NAME="31"></A>haste.
<A NAME="32"></A><BR><BR>The many battles he fought, and the many trophies he won, may make 
<A NAME="33"></A>us ascribe to Philopoemen the more thorough knowledge of war. Titus decided 
<A NAME="34"></A>the matter betwixt Philip and himself in two engagements; but Philopoemen 
<A NAME="35"></A>came off victorious in ten thousand encounters, to all which fortune had 
<A NAME="36"></A>scarcely any pretence, so much were they owing to his skill. Besides, Titus 
<A NAME="37"></A>got his renown, assisted by the power of a flourishing Rome; the other 
<A NAME="38"></A>flourished under a declined Greece, so that his successes may be accounted 
<A NAME="39"></A>his own; in Titus's glory Rome claims a share. The one had brave men under 
<A NAME="40"></A>him, the other made his brave, by being over them. And though Philopoemen 
<A NAME="41"></A>was unfortunate, certainly, in always being opposed to his countrymen, 
<A NAME="42"></A>yet this misfortune is at the same time a proof of his merit. Where the 
<A NAME="43"></A>circumstances are the same, superior success can only be ascribed to superior 
<A NAME="44"></A>merit. And he had, indeed, to do with the two most warlike nations of all 
<A NAME="45"></A>Greece, the Cretans on the one hand, and the Lacedaemonians on the other, 
<A NAME="46"></A>and he mastered the craftiest of them by art and the bravest of them by 
<A NAME="47"></A>valour. It may also be said that Titus, having his men armed and disciplined 
<A NAME="48"></A>to his hand, had in a manner his victories made for him; whereas Philopoemen 
<A NAME="49"></A>was forced to introduce a discipline and tactics of his own, and to new-mould 
<A NAME="50"></A>and model his soldiers; so that what is of greatest import towards insuring 
<A NAME="51"></A>a victory was in his case his own creation, while the other had it ready 
<A NAME="52"></A>provided for his benefit. Philopoemen effected many gallant things with 
<A NAME="53"></A>his own hand, but Titus none; so much so that one Archedemus, an Aetolian, 
<A NAME="54"></A>made it a jest against him that while he, the Aetolian, was running with 
<A NAME="55"></A>his drawn sword, where he saw the Macedonians drawn up closest and fighting 
<A NAME="56"></A>hardest, Titus was standing still, and with hands stretched out to heaven, 
<A NAME="57"></A>praying to the gods for aid.
<A NAME="58"></A><BR><BR>It is true Titus acquitted himself admirably, both as a governor 
<A NAME="59"></A>and as an ambassador; but Philopoemen was no less serviceable and useful 
<A NAME="60"></A>to the Achaeans in the capacity of a private man than in that of a commander. 
<A NAME="61"></A>He was a private citizen when he restored the Messenians to their liberty, 
<A NAME="62"></A>and delivered their city from Nabis; he was also a private citizen when 
<A NAME="63"></A>he rescued the Lacedaemonians, and shut the gates of Sparta against the 
<A NAME="64"></A>general Diophanes and Titus. He had a nature so truly formed for command 
<A NAME="65"></A>that he could govern even the laws themselves for the public good; he did 
<A NAME="66"></A>not need to wait for the formality of being elected into command by the 
<A NAME="67"></A>governed, but employed their service, if occasion required, at his own 
<A NAME="68"></A>discretion; judging that he who understood their real interests was more 
<A NAME="69"></A>truly their supreme magistrate, than he whom they had elected to the office. 
<A NAME="70"></A>The equity, clemency, and humanity of Titus towards the Greeks display 
<A NAME="71"></A>a great and generous nature; but the actions of Philopoemen, full of courage, 
<A NAME="72"></A>and forward to assert his country's liberty against the Romans, have something 
<A NAME="73"></A>yet greater and nobler in them. For it is not as hard a task to gratify 
<A NAME="74"></A>the indigent and distressed, as to bear up against and to dare to incur 
<A NAME="75"></A>the anger of the powerful. To conclude, since it does not appear to be 
<A NAME="76"></A>easy, by any review or discussion, to establish the true difference of 
<A NAME="77"></A>their merits and decide to which a preference is due, will it be an unfair 
<A NAME="78"></A>award in the case, if we let the Greek bear away the crown for military 
<A NAME="79"></A>conduct and warlike skill, and the Roman for justice and 
<A NAME="80"></A>clemency?
