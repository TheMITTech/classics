<A NAME="2"></A><BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>There are noble points in abundance in the characters of these two men, 
<A NAME="11"></A>and one to be first mentioned is their attaining such a height of greatness 
<A NAME="12"></A>upon such inconsiderable means; and on this score Dion has by far the advantage. 
<A NAME="13"></A>For he had no partner to contest his glory, as Brutus had in Cassius, who 
<A NAME="14"></A>was not, indeed, his equal in proved virtue and honour, yet contributed 
<A NAME="15"></A>quite as much to the service of the war by his boldness, skill, and activity; 
<A NAME="16"></A>and some there be who impute to him the rise and beginning of the whole 
<A NAME="17"></A>enterprise, saying that it was he who roused Brutus, till then indisposed 
<A NAME="18"></A>to stir, into action against Caesar. Whereas Dion seems of himself to have 
<A NAME="19"></A>provided not only arms, ships, and soldiers, but likewise friends and partners 
<A NAME="20"></A>for the enterprise. Neither did he, as Brutus, collect money and forces 
<A NAME="21"></A>from the war itself, but, on the contrary, laid out of his own substance, 
<A NAME="22"></A>and employed the very means of his private sustenance in exile for the 
<A NAME="23"></A>liberty of his country. Besides this, Brutus and Cassius, when they fled 
<A NAME="24"></A>from Rome, could not live safe or quiet, being condemned to death and pursued, 
<A NAME="25"></A>and were thus of necessity forced to take arms and hazard their lives in 
<A NAME="26"></A>their own defence, to save themselves, rather than their country. On the 
<A NAME="27"></A>other hand, Dion enjoyed more ease, was more safe, and his life more pleasant 
<A NAME="28"></A>in his banishment, than was the tyrant's who had banished him, when he 
<A NAME="29"></A>flew to action, and ran the risk of all to save Sicily.
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>Take notice, too, that it was not the same thing for the Sicilians 
<A NAME="31"></A>to be freed from Dionysius, and for the Romans to be freed from Caesar. 
<A NAME="32"></A>The former owned himself a tyrant, and vexed Sicily with a thousand oppressions; 
<A NAME="33"></A>whereas Caesar's supremacy, certainly, in the process for attaining it, 
<A NAME="34"></A>had inflicted no trouble on its opponents, but, once established and victorious, 
<A NAME="35"></A>it had indeed the name and appearance, but fact that was cruel or tyrannical 
<A NAME="36"></A>there was none. On the contrary, in the malady of the times and the need 
<A NAME="37"></A>of a monarchical government, he might be thought to have been sent as the 
<A NAME="38"></A>gentlest physician, by no other than a divine intervention. And thus the 
<A NAME="39"></A>common people instantly regretted Caesar, and grew enraged and implacable 
<A NAME="40"></A>against those that killed him. Whereas Dion's chief offence in the eyes 
<A NAME="41"></A>of his fellow-citizens was his having let Dionysius escape, and not having 
<A NAME="42"></A>demolished the former tyrant's tomb.
<A NAME="43"></A><BR><BR>In the actual conduct of war, Dion was a commander without fault, 
<A NAME="44"></A>improving to the utmost those counsels which he himself gave, and where 
<A NAME="45"></A>others led him into disaster correcting and turning everything to the best. 
<A NAME="46"></A>But Brutus seems to have shown little wisdom in engaging in the final battle, 
<A NAME="47"></A>which was to decide everything, and when he failed not to have done his 
<A NAME="48"></A>business in seeking a remedy; he gave all up, and abandoned his hopes, 
<A NAME="49"></A>not venturing against fortune even as far as Pompey did, when he had still 
<A NAME="50"></A>means enough to rely on in his troops, and was clearly master of all the 
<A NAME="51"></A>seas with his ships.
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR>The greatest thing charged on Brutus is, that he, being saved by 
<A NAME="53"></A>Caesar's kindness, having saved all the friends whom he chose to ask for, 
<A NAME="54"></A>he moreover accounted a friend, and preferred above many, did yet lay violent 
<A NAME="55"></A>hands upon his preserver. Nothing like this could be objected against Dion; 
<A NAME="56"></A>quite the contrary; whilst he was of Dionysius's family and his friend, 
<A NAME="57"></A>he did good service and was useful to him; but driven from his country, 
<A NAME="58"></A>wronged in his wife, and his estate lost, he openly entered upon a war 
<A NAME="59"></A>just and lawful. Does not, however, the matter turn the other way? For 
<A NAME="60"></A>the chief glory of both was their hatred of tyranny, and abhorrence of 
<A NAME="61"></A>wickedness. This was unmixed and sincere in Brutus; for he had no private 
<A NAME="62"></A>quarrel with Caesar, but went into the risk singly for the liberty of his 
<A NAME="63"></A>country. The other, had he not been privately injured, had not fought. 
<A NAME="64"></A>This is plain from Plato's epistles, where it is shown that he was turned 
<A NAME="65"></A>out, and did not forsake the court to wage war upon Dionysius. Moreover, 
<A NAME="66"></A>the public good made Brutus Pompey's friend (instead of his enemy as he 
<A NAME="67"></A>had been) and Caesar's enemy; since he proposed for his hatred and his 
<A NAME="68"></A>friendship no other end and standard but justice. Dion was very serviceable 
<A NAME="69"></A>to Dionysius whilst in favour; when no longer trusted, he grew angry and 
<A NAME="70"></A>fell to arms. And, for this reason, not even were his own friends all of 
<A NAME="71"></A>them satisfied with his undertaking, or quite assured that, having overcome 
<A NAME="72"></A>Dionysius, he might not settle the government on himself, deceiving his 
<A NAME="73"></A>fellow-citizens by some less obnoxious name than tyranny. But the very 
<A NAME="74"></A>enemies of Brutus would say that he had no other end or aim, from first 
<A NAME="75"></A>to last, save only to restore to the Roman people their ancient 
<A NAME="76"></A>government.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>And apart from what has just been said, the adventure against Dionysius 
<A NAME="78"></A>was nothing equal with that against Caesar. For none that was familiarly 
<A NAME="79"></A>conversant with Dionysius but scorned him for his life of idle amusement 
<A NAME="80"></A>with wine, women, and dice; whereas it required an heroic soul and a truly 
<A NAME="81"></A>intrepid and unquailing spirit so much as to entertain the thought of crushing 
<A NAME="82"></A>Caesar, so formidable for his ability, his power, and his fortune, whose 
<A NAME="83"></A>very name disturbed the slumbers of the Parthian and Indian kings. Dion 
<A NAME="84"></A>was no sooner seen in Sicily but thousands ran in to him and joined him 
<A NAME="85"></A>against Dionysius; whereas the renown of Caesar, even when dead, gave strength 
<A NAME="86"></A>to his friends; and his very name so heightened the person that took it, 
<A NAME="87"></A>that from a simple boy he presently became the chief of the Romans; and 
<A NAME="88"></A>he could use it for a spell against the enmity and power of Antony. If 
<A NAME="89"></A>any object that it cost Dion great trouble and difficulties to overcome 
<A NAME="90"></A>the tyrant, whereas Brutus slew Caesar naked and unprovided, yet this itself 
<A NAME="91"></A>was the result of the most consummate policy and conduct, to bring it about 
<A NAME="92"></A>that a man so guarded around, and so fortified at all points, should be 
<A NAME="93"></A>taken naked and unprovided. For it was not on the sudden, nor alone, nor 
<A NAME="94"></A>with a few, that he fell upon and killed Caesar; but after long concerting 
<A NAME="95"></A>the plot, and placing confidence in a great many men, not one of whom deceived 
<A NAME="96"></A>him. For he either at once discerned the best men, or by confiding in them 
<A NAME="97"></A>made them good. But Dion, either making a wrong judgment, trusted himself 
<A NAME="98"></A>with ill men, or else by his employing them made ill men of good; either 
<A NAME="99"></A>of the two would be a reflection on a wise man. Plato also is severe upon 
<A NAME="100"></A>him, for choosing such for friends as betrayed him.
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR>Besides, when Dion was killed, none appeared to revenge his death. 
<A NAME="102"></A>Whereas Brutus, even amongst his enemies, had Antony that buried him splendidly; 
<A NAME="103"></A>and Caesar also took care his honours should be preserved. There stood 
<A NAME="104"></A>at Milan in Gaul, within the Alps, a brazen statue, which Caesar in aftertimes 
<A NAME="105"></A>noticed (being a real likeness, and a fine work of art), and passing by 
<A NAME="106"></A>it presently stopped short, and in the hearing of many commanded the magistrates 
<A NAME="107"></A>to come before him. He told them their town had broken their league, harbouring 
<A NAME="108"></A>an enemy. The magistrates at first simply denied the thing, and, not knowing 
<A NAME="109"></A>what he meant, looked one upon another, when Caesar, turning towards the 
<A NAME="110"></A>statue and gathering his brows, said, "Pray, is not that our enemy who 
<A NAME="111"></A>stands there?" They were all in confusion, and had nothing to answer; but 
<A NAME="112"></A>he, smiling, much commended the Gauls, as who had been firm to their friends, 
<A NAME="113"></A>though in adversity, and ordered that the statue should remain standing 
<A NAME="114"></A>as he found it.
