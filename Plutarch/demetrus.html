<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>INGENIOUS men have long observed a resemblance between the arts and the 
<A NAME="11"></A>bodily senses. And they were first led to do so, I think, by noticing the 
<A NAME="12"></A>way in which, both in the arts and with our senses, we examine opposites. 
<A NAME="13"></A>Judgment once obtained, the use to which we put it differs in the two cases. 
<A NAME="14"></A>Our senses are not meant to pick out black rather than white, to prefer 
<A NAME="15"></A>sweet to bitter, or soft and yielding to hard and resisting objects; all 
<A NAME="16"></A>they have to do is to receive impressions as they occur, and report to 
<A NAME="17"></A>the understanding the impressions as received. The arts, on the other hand, 
<A NAME="18"></A>which reason institutes expressly to choose and obtain some suitable, and 
<A NAME="19"></A>to refuse and get rid of some unsuitable object, have their proper concern 
<A NAME="20"></A>in the consideration of the former; though, in a casual and contingent 
<A NAME="21"></A>way, they must also, for the very rejection of them, pay attention to the 
<A NAME="22"></A>latter. Medicine, to produce health, has to examine disease, and music, 
<A NAME="23"></A>to create harmony, must investigate discord; and the supreme arts, of temperance, 
<A NAME="24"></A>of justice, and of wisdom, as they are acts of judgment and selection, 
<A NAME="25"></A>exercised not on good and just and expedient only, but also on wicked, 
<A NAME="26"></A>unjust, and inexpedient objects, do not give their commendations to the 
<A NAME="27"></A>mere innocence whose boast is its inexperience of evil, and whose truer 
<A NAME="28"></A>name is, by their award, simpleness and ignorance of what all men who live 
<A NAME="29"></A>aright should know. The ancient Spartans, at their festivals, used to force 
<A NAME="30"></A>their Helots to swallow large quantities of raw wine, and then expose them 
<A NAME="31"></A>at the public tables, to let the young men see what it is to be drunk. 
<A NAME="32"></A>And, though I do not think it consistent with humanity or with civil justice 
<A NAME="33"></A>to correct one man's morals by corrupting those of another, yet we may, 
<A NAME="34"></A>I think, avail ourselves of the cases of those who have fallen into indiscretions, 
<A NAME="35"></A>and have, in high stations, made themselves conspicuous for misconduct; 
<A NAME="36"></A>and I shall not do ill to introduce a pair or two of such examples among 
<A NAME="37"></A>these biographies, not, assuredly, to amuse and divert my readers, or give 
<A NAME="38"></A>variety to my theme, but as Ismenias, the Theban, used to show his scholars 
<A NAME="39"></A>good and bad performers on the flute, and to tell them, "You should play 
<A NAME="40"></A>like this man," and, "You should not play like that," and as Antigenidas 
<A NAME="41"></A>used to say, Young people would take greater pleasure in hearing good playing, 
<A NAME="42"></A>if first they were set to hear bad, so, in the same manner, it seems to 
<A NAME="43"></A>me likely enough that we shall be all the more zealous and more emulous 
<A NAME="44"></A>to read, observe, and imitate the better lives, if we are not left in ignorance 
<A NAME="45"></A>of the blameworthy and the bad.
<A NAME="46"></A><BR><BR>For this reason, the following book contains the lives of Demetrius 
<A NAME="47"></A>Poliorcetes and Antonius the Triumvir; two persons who have abundantly 
<A NAME="48"></A>justified the words of Plato, that great natures produce great vices as 
<A NAME="49"></A>well as virtues. Both alike were amorous and intemperate, warlike and munificent, 
<A NAME="50"></A>sumptuous in their way of living and overbearing in their manners. And 
<A NAME="51"></A>the likeness of their fortunes carried out the resemblance in their characters. 
<A NAME="52"></A>Not only were their lives each a series of great successes and great disasters, 
<A NAME="53"></A>mighty acquisitions and tremendous losses of power, sudden overthrows followed 
<A NAME="54"></A>by unexpected recoveries, but they died, also, Demetrius in actual captivity 
<A NAME="55"></A>to his enemies and Antony on the verge of it.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR>Antigonus had by his wife, Stratonice, the daughter of Corrhaeus, 
<A NAME="57"></A>two sons; the one of whom, after the name of his uncle, he called Demetrius, 
<A NAME="58"></A>the other had that of his grandfather Philip, and died young. This is the 
<A NAME="59"></A>most general account, although some have related that Demetrius was not 
<A NAME="60"></A>the son of Antigonus, but of his brother; and that his own father dying 
<A NAME="61"></A>young, and his mother being afterwards married to Antigonus, he was accounted 
<A NAME="62"></A>to be his son.
<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR>Demetrius had not the height of his father Antigonus, though he 
<A NAME="64"></A>was a tall man. But his countenance was one of such singular beauty and 
<A NAME="65"></A>expression that no painter or sculptor ever produced a good likeness of 
<A NAME="66"></A>him. It combined grace and strength, dignity with boyish bloom, and, in 
<A NAME="67"></A>the midst of youthful heat and passion, what was hardest of all to represent 
<A NAME="68"></A>was a certain heroic look and air of kingly greatness. Nor did his character 
<A NAME="69"></A>belie his looks, as no one was better able to render himself both loved 
<A NAME="70"></A>and feared. For as he was the most easy and agreeable of companions, and 
<A NAME="71"></A>the most luxurious and delicate of princes in his drinking and banqueting 
<A NAME="72"></A>and daily pleasures, so in action there was never any one that showed a 
<A NAME="73"></A>more vehement persistence, or a more passionate energy. Bacchus, skilled 
<A NAME="74"></A>in the conduct of war, and after war in giving peace its pleasures and 
<A NAME="75"></A>joys, seems to have been his pattern among the gods.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR>He was wonderfully fond of his father Antigonus; and the tenderness 
<A NAME="77"></A>he had for his mother led him, for her sake, to redouble attentions, which 
<A NAME="78"></A>it was evident were not so much owing to fear or duty as to the more powerful 
<A NAME="79"></A>motives of inclination. It is reported that, returning one day from hunting, 
<A NAME="80"></A>he went immediately into the apartment of Antigonus, who was conversing 
<A NAME="81"></A>with some ambassadors, and after stepping up and kissing his father, he 
<A NAME="82"></A>sat down by him, just as he was, still holding in his hand the javelins 
<A NAME="83"></A>which he had brought with him. Whereupon Antigonus, who had just dismissed 
<A NAME="84"></A>the ambassadors with their answer, called out in a loud voice to them, 
<A NAME="85"></A>as they were going, "Mention, also, that this is the way in which we two 
<A NAME="86"></A>live together;" as if to imply to them that it was no slender mark of the 
<A NAME="87"></A>power and security of his government that there was so perfect good understanding 
<A NAME="88"></A>between himself and his son. Such an unsociable, solitary thing is power, 
<A NAME="89"></A>and so much of jealousy and distrust in it, that the first and greatest 
<A NAME="90"></A>of the successors of Alexander could make it a thing of glory in that he 
<A NAME="91"></A>was not so afraid of his son as to forbid his standing beside him with 
<A NAME="92"></A>a weapon in his hand. And, in fact, among all the successors of Alexander, 
<A NAME="93"></A>that of Antigonus was the only house which, for many descents, was exempted 
<A NAME="94"></A>from crime of this kind; or to state it exactly, Philip was the only one 
<A NAME="95"></A>of this family who was guilty of a son's death. All the other families, 
<A NAME="96"></A>we may fairly say, afforded frequent examples of fathers who brought their 
<A NAME="97"></A>children, husbands their wives, children their mothers, to untimely ends; 
<A NAME="98"></A>and that brothers should put brothers to death was assumed, like the postulate 
<A NAME="99"></A>of mathematicians as the common and recognized royal first principle of 
<A NAME="100"></A>safety.
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR>Let us here record an example in the early life of Demetrius, showing 
<A NAME="102"></A>his natural humane and kindly disposition. It was an adventure which passed 
<A NAME="103"></A>betwixt him and Mithridates, the son of Ariobarzanes, who was about the 
<A NAME="104"></A>same age with Demetrius, and lived with him, in attendance on Antigonus; 
<A NAME="105"></A>and although nothing was said or could be said to his reproach, he fell 
<A NAME="106"></A>under suspicion, in consequence of a dream which Antigonus had. Antigonus 
<A NAME="107"></A>thought himself in a fair and spacious field, where he sowed golden seed, 
<A NAME="108"></A>and saw presently a golden crop come up; of which, however, looking presently 
<A NAME="109"></A>again, he saw nothing remain but the stubble, without the ears. And as 
<A NAME="110"></A>he stood by in anger and vexation, he heard some voices saying Mithridates 
<A NAME="111"></A>had cut the golden harvest and carried it off into Pontus. Antigonus, much 
<A NAME="112"></A>discomposed with his dream, first bound his son, by an oath not to speak, 
<A NAME="113"></A>and then related it to him, adding that he had resolved, in consequence, 
<A NAME="114"></A>to lose no time in ridding himself of Mithridates, and making away with 
<A NAME="115"></A>him. Demetrius was extremely distressed; and when the young man came, as 
<A NAME="116"></A>usual, to pass his time with him, to keep his oath he forbore from saying 
<A NAME="117"></A>a word, but, drawing him aside little by little from the company, as soon 
<A NAME="118"></A>as they were by themselves, without opening his lips, with the point of 
<A NAME="119"></A>his javelin he traced before him the words "Fly, Mithridates." Mithridates 
<A NAME="120"></A>took the hint, and fled by night into Cappadocia, where Antigonus's dream 
<A NAME="121"></A>about him was quickly brought to its due fulfillment; for he got possession 
<A NAME="122"></A>of a large and fertile territory; and from him descended the line of the 
<A NAME="123"></A>kings of Pontus, which, in the eighth generation, was reduced by the Romans. 
<A NAME="124"></A>This may serve for a specimen of the early goodness and love of justice 
<A NAME="125"></A>that was part of Demetrius's natural character.
<A NAME="126"></A><BR><BR>But as in the elements of the world, Empedocles tells us, out of 
<A NAME="127"></A>liking and dislike, there springs up contention and warfare, and all the 
<A NAME="128"></A>more, the closer the contact, or the nearer the approach of the objects, 
<A NAME="129"></A>even so the perpetual hostilities among the successors of Alexander were 
<A NAME="130"></A>aggravated and inflamed, in particular cases, by juxtaposition of interests 
<A NAME="131"></A>and of territories; as, for example, in the case of Antigonus and Ptolemy. 
<A NAME="132"></A>News came to Antigonus that Ptolemy had crossed from Cyprus and invaded 
<A NAME="133"></A>Syria, and was ravaging the country and reducing the cities. Remaining, 
<A NAME="134"></A>therefore, himself in Phrygia, he sent Demetrius, now twenty-two years 
<A NAME="135"></A>old, to make his first essay as sole commander in an important charge. 
<A NAME="136"></A>He, whose youthful heat outran his experience, advancing against an adversary 
<A NAME="137"></A>trained in Alexander's school, and practised in many encounters, incurred 
<A NAME="138"></A>a great defeat near the town of Gaza, in which eight thousand of his men 
<A NAME="139"></A>were taken and five thousand killed. His own tent, also his money, and 
<A NAME="140"></A>all his private effects and furniture, were captured. These, however, Ptolemy 
<A NAME="141"></A>sent back, together with his friends, accompanying them with the humane 
<A NAME="142"></A>and courteous message, that they were not fighting for anything else but 
<A NAME="143"></A>honour and dominion. Demetrius accepted the gift praying only to the gods 
<A NAME="144"></A>not to leave him long in Ptolemy's debt, but to let him have an early chance 
<A NAME="145"></A>of doing the like to him. He took his disaster, also, with the temper, 
<A NAME="146"></A>not of a boy defeated in his attempt, but of an old and long-tried general 
<A NAME="147"></A>familiar with reverse of fortune; he busied himself in collecting his men, 
<A NAME="148"></A>replenishing his magazines, watching the allegiance of the cities, and 
<A NAME="149"></A>drilling his new recruits.
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR>Antigonus received the news of the battle with the remark that 
<A NAME="151"></A>Ptolemy had beaten boys and would now have to fight with men. But not to 
<A NAME="152"></A>humble the spirit of his son, he acceded to his request, and left him to 
<A NAME="153"></A>command on the next occasion.
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR>Not long after, Cilles, Ptolemy's lieutenant, with a powerful army, 
<A NAME="155"></A>took the field, and looking upon Demetrius as already defeated by the previous 
<A NAME="156"></A>battle, he had in his imagination driven him out of Syria before he saw 
<A NAME="157"></A>him. But he quickly found himself deceived; for Demetrius came so unexpectedly 
<A NAME="158"></A>upon him that he surprised both the general and his army, making him and 
<A NAME="159"></A>seven thousand of the soldiers prisoners of war, and possessing himself 
<A NAME="160"></A>of a large amount of treasure. But his joy in the victory was not so much 
<A NAME="161"></A>for the prizes he should keep, as for those he could restore; and his thankfulness 
<A NAME="162"></A>was less for the wealth and glory than for the means it gave him of requiting 
<A NAME="163"></A>his enemy's former generosity. He did not, however, take it into his own 
<A NAME="164"></A>hands, but wrote to his father. And on receiving leave to do as he liked, 
<A NAME="165"></A>he sent back to Ptolemy Cilles and his friends, loaded with presents. This 
<A NAME="166"></A>defeat drove Ptolemy out of Syria, and brought Antigonus from Calaenae 
<A NAME="167"></A>to enjoy the victory and the sight of the son who had gained 
<A NAME="168"></A>it.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>Soon after, Demetrius was sent to bring the Nabathaean Arabs into 
<A NAME="170"></A>obedience. And here he got into a district without water, and incurred 
<A NAME="171"></A>considerable danger, but by his resolute and composed demeanour he overawed 
<A NAME="172"></A>the barbarians, and returned after receiving from them a large amount of 
<A NAME="173"></A>booty and seven hundred camels. Not long after, Seleucus, whom Antigonus 
<A NAME="174"></A>had formerly chased out of Babylon, but who had afterwards recovered his 
<A NAME="175"></A>dominion by his own efforts and maintained himself in it, went with large 
<A NAME="176"></A>forces on an expedition to reduce the tribes on the confines of India and 
<A NAME="177"></A>the provinces near Mount Caucasus. And Demetrius, conjecturing that he 
<A NAME="178"></A>had left Mesopotamia but slenderly guarded in his absence, suddenly passed 
<A NAME="179"></A>the Euphrates with his army and made his way into Babylonia unexpectedly; 
<A NAME="180"></A>when he succeeded in capturing one of the two citadels, out of which he 
<A NAME="181"></A>expelled the garrison of Seleucus, and placed in it seven thousand men 
<A NAME="182"></A>of his own. And after allowing his soldiers to enrich themselves with all 
<A NAME="183"></A>the spoil they could carry with them out of the country, he retired to 
<A NAME="184"></A>the sea, leaving Seleucus more securely master of his dominions than before, 
<A NAME="185"></A>as he seemed by this conduct to abandon every claim to a country which 
<A NAME="186"></A>he treated like an enemy's. However, by a rapid advance, he rescued Halicarnassus 
<A NAME="187"></A>from Ptolemy, who was besieging it. The glory which this act obtained them 
<A NAME="188"></A>inspired both the father and son with a wonderful desire for freeing Greece, 
<A NAME="189"></A>which Cassander and Ptolemy had everywhere reduced to slavery. No nobler 
<A NAME="190"></A>or juster war was undertaken by any of the kings; the wealth they had gained 
<A NAME="191"></A>while humbling, with Greek assistance, the barbarians, being thus employed, 
<A NAME="192"></A>for honour's sake and good repute, in helping the Greeks. When the resolution 
<A NAME="193"></A>was taken to begin their attempt with Athens, one of his friends told Antigonus, 
<A NAME="194"></A>if they captured Athens, they must keep it safe in their own hands, as 
<A NAME="195"></A>by this gangway they might step out from their ships into Greece when they 
<A NAME="196"></A>pleased. But Antigonus would not hear of it; he did not want a better or 
<A NAME="197"></A>a steadier gangway than people's good-will; and from Athens, the beacon 
<A NAME="198"></A>of the world, the news of their conduct would soon be handed on to all 
<A NAME="199"></A>the world's inhabitants. So Demetrius, with a sum of five thousand talents, 
<A NAME="200"></A>and a fleet of two hundred and fifty ships, set sail for Athens, where 
<A NAME="201"></A>Demetrius the Phalerian was governing the city for Cassander, with a garrison 
<A NAME="202"></A>lodged in the port of Munychia. By good fortune and skilful management 
<A NAME="203"></A>he appeared before Piraeus, on the twenty-sixth of Thargelion, before anything 
<A NAME="204"></A>had been heard of him. Indeed, when his ships were seen, they were taken 
<A NAME="205"></A>for Ptolemy's and preparations were commenced for receiving them; till 
<A NAME="206"></A>at last, the generals discovering their mistake, hurried down, and all 
<A NAME="207"></A>was alarm and confusion, and attempts to push forward preparations to oppose 
<A NAME="208"></A>the landing of this hostile force. For Demetrius, having found the entrances 
<A NAME="209"></A>of the port undefended, stood in directly, and was by this time safely 
<A NAME="210"></A>inside, before the eyes of everybody, and made signals from his ship, requesting 
<A NAME="211"></A>a peaceful hearing. And on leave being given, he caused a herald with a 
<A NAME="212"></A>loud voice to make proclamation that he was come thither by the command 
<A NAME="213"></A>of his father, with no other design than what he prayed the gods to prosper 
<A NAME="214"></A>with success, to give the Athenians their liberty, to expel the garrison, 
<A NAME="215"></A>and to restore the ancient laws and constitution of the 
<A NAME="216"></A>country.
<A NAME="217"></A><BR><BR>The people, hearing this, at once threw down their shields, and 
<A NAME="218"></A>clapping their hands, with loud acclamations entreated Demetrius to land, 
<A NAME="219"></A>calling him their deliverer and benefactor. And the Phalerian and his party, 
<A NAME="220"></A>who saw that there was nothing for it but to receive the conqueror, whether 
<A NAME="221"></A>he should perform his promises or not, sent, however, messengers to beg 
<A NAME="222"></A>for his protection; to whom Demetrius gave a kind reception, and sent back 
<A NAME="223"></A>with them Aristodemus of Miletus, one of his father's friends. The Phalerian, 
<A NAME="224"></A>under the change of government, was more afraid of his fellow-citizens 
<A NAME="225"></A>than of the enemy; but Demetrius took precautions for him, and out of respect 
<A NAME="226"></A>for his reputation and character, sent him with a safe conduct to Thebes, 
<A NAME="227"></A>whither he desired to go. For himself, he declared he would not, in spite 
<A NAME="228"></A>of all his curiosity, put his foot in the city till he had completed his 
<A NAME="229"></A>deliverance by driving out the garrison. So blockading Munychia with a 
<A NAME="230"></A>palisade and trench, he sailed off to attack Megara, where also there was 
<A NAME="231"></A>one of Cassander's garrisons. But, hearing that Cratesipolis, the wife 
<A NAME="232"></A>of Alexander, son of Polysperchon, who was famous for her beauty, was well 
<A NAME="233"></A>disposed to see him, he left his troops near Megara, and set out with a 
<A NAME="234"></A>few light-armed attendants for Patrae, where she was now staying. And, 
<A NAME="235"></A>quitting these also, he pitched his tent apart from everybody, that the 
<A NAME="236"></A>woman might pay her visit without being seen. This some of the enemy perceived, 
<A NAME="237"></A>and suddenly attacked him; and, in his alarm, he was obliged to disguise 
<A NAME="238"></A>himself in a shabby cloak, and run for it, narrowly escaping the shame 
<A NAME="239"></A>of being made a prisoner, in reward for his foolish passion. And as it 
<A NAME="240"></A>was, his tent and money were taken. Megara, however, surrendered, and would 
<A NAME="241"></A>have been pillaged by the soldiers, but for the urgent intercession of 
<A NAME="242"></A>the Athenians. The garrison was driven out, and the city restored to independence. 
<A NAME="243"></A>While he was occupied in this, he remembered that Stilpo, the philosopher, 
<A NAME="244"></A>famous for his choice of a life of tranquillity, was residing here. He, 
<A NAME="245"></A>therefore, sent for him, and begged to know whether anything belonging 
<A NAME="246"></A>to him had been taken. "No," replied Stilpo, "I have not met with any one 
<A NAME="247"></A>to take away knowledge." Pretty nearly all the servants in the city had 
<A NAME="248"></A>been stolen away; and so, when Demetrius, renewing his courtesies to Stilpo, 
<A NAME="249"></A>on taking leave of him, said, "I leave your city, Stilpo, a city of freemen." 
<A NAME="250"></A>"Certainly," replied Stilpo, "there is not one serving man left among us 
<A NAME="251"></A>all."
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR>Returning from Megara, he sat down before the citadel of Munychia, 
<A NAME="253"></A>which in a few days he took by assault, and caused the fortifications to 
<A NAME="254"></A>be demolished; and thus having accomplished his design, upon the request 
<A NAME="255"></A>and invitation of the Athenians he made his entrance into the upper city, 
<A NAME="256"></A>where, causing the people to be summoned, he publicly announced to them 
<A NAME="257"></A>that their ancient constitution was restored, and that they should receive 
<A NAME="258"></A>from his father, Antigonus, a present of one hundred and fifty thousand 
<A NAME="259"></A>measures of wheat, and such a supply of timber as would enable them to 
<A NAME="260"></A>build a hundred galleys. In this manner did the Athenians recover their 
<A NAME="261"></A>popular institutions, after the space of fifteen years from the time of 
<A NAME="262"></A>the war of Lamia and the battle before Cranon, during which interval of 
<A NAME="263"></A>time the government had been administered nominally as an oligarchy, but 
<A NAME="264"></A>really by a single man, Demetrius the Phalerian being so powerful. But 
<A NAME="265"></A>the excessive honours which the Athenians bestowed, for these noble and 
<A NAME="266"></A>generous acts, upon Demetrius, created offence and disgust. The Athenians 
<A NAME="267"></A>were the first who gave Antigonus and Demetrius the title of kings, which 
<A NAME="268"></A>hitherto they had made it a point of piety to decline, as the one remaining 
<A NAME="269"></A>royal honour still reserved for the lineal descendants of Philip and Alexander, 
<A NAME="270"></A>in which none but they could venture to participate. Another name which 
<A NAME="271"></A>they received from no people but the Athenians was that of the Tutelar 
<A NAME="272"></A>Deities and Deliverers. And to enhance this flattery, by a common vote 
<A NAME="273"></A>it was decreed to change the style of the city, and not to have the years 
<A NAME="274"></A>named any longer from the annual archon; a priest of the two Tutelary Divinities, 
<A NAME="275"></A>who was to be yearly chosen, was to have this honour, and all public acts 
<A NAME="276"></A>and instruments were to bear their date by his name. They decreed, also, 
<A NAME="277"></A>that the figures of Antigonus and Demetrius should be woven, with those 
<A NAME="278"></A>of the gods, into the pattern of the great robe. They consecrated the spot 
<A NAME="279"></A>where Demetrius first alighted from his chariot, and built an altar there, 
<A NAME="280"></A>with the name of the Altar of the Descent of Demetrius. They created two 
<A NAME="281"></A>new tribes, calling them after the names of these princes, the Antigonid 
<A NAME="282"></A>and the Demetriad; and to the Council, which consisted of five hundred 
<A NAME="283"></A>persons, fifty being chosen out of every tribe, they added one hundred 
<A NAME="284"></A>more to represent these new tribes. But the wildest proposal was one made 
<A NAME="285"></A>by Stratocles, the great inventor of all these ingenious and exquisite 
<A NAME="286"></A>compliments, enacting that the members of any deputation that the city 
<A NAME="287"></A>should send to Demetrius or Antigonus should have the same title as those 
<A NAME="288"></A>sent to Delphi or Olympia for the performance of the national sacrifices 
<A NAME="289"></A>in behalf of the state at the great Greek festivals. This Stratocles was, 
<A NAME="290"></A>in all respects, an audacious and abandoned character, and seemed to have 
<A NAME="291"></A>made it his object to copy, by his buffoonery and impertinence, Cleon's 
<A NAME="292"></A>old familiarity with the people. His mistress, Phylacion, one day bringing 
<A NAME="293"></A>him a dish of brains and neckbones for his dinner, "Oh," said he, "I am 
<A NAME="294"></A>to dine upon the things which we statesmen play at ball with." At another 
<A NAME="295"></A>time, when the Athenians received their naval defeat near Amorgos, he hastened 
<A NAME="296"></A>home before the news could reach the city, and having a chaplet on his 
<A NAME="297"></A>head, came riding through the Ceramicus, announcing that they had won a 
<A NAME="298"></A>victory, and moved a vote for thanksgivings to the gods, and a distribution 
<A NAME="299"></A>of meat among the people in their tribes. Presently after came those who 
<A NAME="300"></A>brought home the wrecks from the battle; and when the people exclaimed 
<A NAME="301"></A>at what he had done, he came boldly to face the outcry, and asked what 
<A NAME="302"></A>harm there had been in giving them two days' pleasure.
<A NAME="303"></A><BR><BR>Such was Stratocles. And, "adding flame to fire," as Aristophanes 
<A NAME="304"></A>says, there was one who, to outdo Stratocles, proposed that it should be 
<A NAME="305"></A>decreed that, whensoever Demetrius should honour their city with his presence, 
<A NAME="306"></A>they should treat him with the same show of hospitable entertainment with 
<A NAME="307"></A>which Ceres and Bacchus are received; and the citizen who exceeded the 
<A NAME="308"></A>rest in the splendour and costliness of his reception should have a sum 
<A NAME="309"></A>of money granted him from the public purse to make a sacred offering. Finally, 
<A NAME="310"></A>they changed the name of the month of Munychion, and called it Demetrion; 
<A NAME="311"></A>they gave the name of the Demetrion to the odd day between the end of the 
<A NAME="312"></A>old and the beginning of the new month; and turned the feast of Bacchus, 
<A NAME="313"></A>the Dionysia, into the Demetria or feast of Demetrius. Most of these changes 
<A NAME="314"></A>were marked by the divine displeasure. The sacred robe, in which, according 
<A NAME="315"></A>to their decree, the figures of Demetrius and Antigonus had been woven 
<A NAME="316"></A>with those of Jupiter and Minerva, was caught by a violent gust of wind, 
<A NAME="317"></A>while the procession was conveying it through the Ceramicus, and was torn 
<A NAME="318"></A>from the top to the bottom. A crop of hemlock, a plant which scarcely grew 
<A NAME="319"></A>anywhere, even in the country thereabouts, sprang up in abundance round 
<A NAME="320"></A>the altars which they had erected to these new divinities. They had to 
<A NAME="321"></A>omit the solemn procession at the feast of Bacchus, as upon the very day 
<A NAME="322"></A>of its celebration there was such a severe and rigorous frost, coming quite 
<A NAME="323"></A>out of its time, that not only the vines and fig-trees were killed, but 
<A NAME="324"></A>almost all the wheat was destroyed in the blade. Accordingly, Philippides, 
<A NAME="325"></A>an enemy to Stratocles, attacked him in a comedy, in the following 
<A NAME="326"></A>verses:-
<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR>"He for whom frosts that nipped your vines were 
<A NAME="328"></A>sent,
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>And for whose sins the holy robe was rent,
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>Who grants to men the gods' own honours, he,
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>Not the poor stage, is now the people's enemy." Philippides was a great 
<A NAME="332"></A>favourite with King Lysimachus, from whom the Athenians received, for his 
<A NAME="333"></A>sake, a variety of kindnesses. Lysimachus went so far as to think it a 
<A NAME="334"></A>happy omen to meet or see Philippides at the outset of any enterprise or 
<A NAME="335"></A>expedition. And, in general, he was well thought of for his own character, 
<A NAME="336"></A>as a plain, uninterfering person, with none of the officious, self-important 
<A NAME="337"></A>habits of a court. Once, when Lysimachus was solicitous to show him kindness, 
<A NAME="338"></A>and asked what he had that he could make him a present of, "Anything," 
<A NAME="339"></A>replied Philippides, "but your state secrets." The stage-player, we thought, 
<A NAME="340"></A>deserved a place in our narrative quite as well as the public 
<A NAME="341"></A>speaker.
<A NAME="342"></A><BR><BR>But that which exceeded all the former follies and flatteries was 
<A NAME="343"></A>the proposal of Dromoclides of Sphettus; who, when there was a debate about 
<A NAME="344"></A>sending to the Delphic Oracle to inquire the proper course for the consecration 
<A NAME="345"></A>of certain bucklers, moved in the assembly that they should rather send 
<A NAME="346"></A>to receive an oracle from Demetrius. I will transcribe the very words of 
<A NAME="347"></A>the order, which was in these terms: "May it be happy and propitious. The 
<A NAME="348"></A>people of Athens have decreed, that a fit person shall be chosen among 
<A NAME="349"></A>the Athenian citizens, who shall be deputed to be sent to the Deliverer; 
<A NAME="350"></A>and after he hath duly performed the sacrifices, shall inquire of the Deliverer, 
<A NAME="351"></A>in what most religious and decent manner he will please to direct, at the 
<A NAME="352"></A>earliest possible time, the consecration of the bucklers; and according 
<A NAME="353"></A>to the answer the people shall act." With this befooling they completed 
<A NAME="354"></A>the perversion of a mind which even before was not so strong or sound as 
<A NAME="355"></A>it should have been.
<A NAME="356"></A><BR><BR>During his present leisure in Athens, he took to wife Eurydice, 
<A NAME="357"></A>a descendant of the ancient Miltiades, who had been married to Opheltas, 
<A NAME="358"></A>the ruler of Cyrene, and after his death had come back to Athens. The Athenians 
<A NAME="359"></A>took the marriage as a compliment and favour to the city. But Demetrius 
<A NAME="360"></A>was very free in these matters, and was the husband of several wives at 
<A NAME="361"></A>once; the highest place and honour among all being retained by Phila, who 
<A NAME="362"></A>was Antipater's daughter, and had been the wife of Craterus, the one of 
<A NAME="363"></A>all the successors of Alexander who left behind him the strongest feelings 
<A NAME="364"></A>of attachment among the Macedonians. And for these reasons Antigonus had 
<A NAME="365"></A>obliged him to marry her, notwithstanding the disparity of their years, 
<A NAME="366"></A>Demetrius being quite a youth, and she much older; and when upon that account 
<A NAME="367"></A>he made some difficulty in complying, Antigonus whispered in his ear the 
<A NAME="368"></A>maxim from Euripides, broadly substituting a new word for the original, 
<A NAME="369"></A>serve-
<A NAME="370"></A><BR><BR>"Natural or not,
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>A man must wed where profit will be got." Any respect, however, which 
<A NAME="372"></A>he showed either to Phila or to his other wives did not go so far as to 
<A NAME="373"></A>prevent him from consorting with any number of mistresses, and bearing, 
<A NAME="374"></A>in this respect, the worst character of all the princes of his 
<A NAME="375"></A>time.
<A NAME="376"></A><BR><BR>A summons now arrived from his father, ordering him to go and fight 
<A NAME="377"></A>with Ptolemy in Cyprus, which he was obliged to obey, sorry as he was to 
<A NAME="378"></A>abandon Greece. And in quitting this nobler and more glorious enterprise, 
<A NAME="379"></A>he sent to Cleonides, Ptolemy's general, who was holding garrisons in Sicyon 
<A NAME="380"></A>and Corinth, offering him money to let the cities be independent. But on 
<A NAME="381"></A>his refusal, he set sail hastily, taking additional forces with him, and 
<A NAME="382"></A>made for Cyprus; where, immediately upon his arrival, he fell upon Menelaus, 
<A NAME="383"></A>the brother of Ptolemy, and gave him a defeat. But when Ptolemy himself 
<A NAME="384"></A>came in person, with large forces both on land and sea, for some little 
<A NAME="385"></A>time nothing took place beyond an interchange of menaces and lofty talk. 
<A NAME="386"></A>Ptolemy bade Demetrius sail off before the whole armament came up, if he 
<A NAME="387"></A>did not wish to be trampled under foot; and Demetrius offered to let him 
<A NAME="388"></A>retire, on condition of his withdrawing his garrisons from Sicyon and Corinth. 
<A NAME="389"></A>And not they alone, but all the other potentates and princes of the time, 
<A NAME="390"></A>were in anxiety for the uncertain impending issue of the conflict; as it 
<A NAME="391"></A>seemed evident that the conqueror's prize would be, not Cyprus or Syria, 
<A NAME="392"></A>but the absolute supremacy.
<A NAME="393"></A><BR><BR>Ptolemy had brought a hundred and fifty galleys with him, and gave 
<A NAME="394"></A>orders to Menelaus to sally, in the heat of the battle, out of the harbour 
<A NAME="395"></A>of Salamis, and attack with sixty ships the rear of Demetrius. Demetrius, 
<A NAME="396"></A>however, opposing to these sixty ten of his galleys, which were a sufficient 
<A NAME="397"></A>number to block up the narrow entrance of the harbour, and drawing out 
<A NAME="398"></A>his land forces along all the headlands running out into sea, went into 
<A NAME="399"></A>action with a hundred and eighty galleys, and, attacking with the utmost 
<A NAME="400"></A>boldness and impetuosity, utterly routed Ptolemy, who fled with eight ships, 
<A NAME="401"></A>the sole remnant of his fleet, seventy having been taken with all their 
<A NAME="402"></A>men, and the rest destroyed in the battle; while the whole multitude of 
<A NAME="403"></A>attendants, friends, and women, that had followed in the ships of burden, 
<A NAME="404"></A>all the arms, treasure, and military engines fell, without exception, into 
<A NAME="405"></A>the hands of Demetrius, and were by him collected and brought into the 
<A NAME="406"></A>camp. Among the prisoners was the celebrated Lamia, famed at one time for 
<A NAME="407"></A>her skill on the flute, and afterwards renowned as a mistress. And although 
<A NAME="408"></A>now upon the wane of her youthful beauty, and though Demetrius was much 
<A NAME="409"></A>her junior, she exercised over him so great a charm that all other women 
<A NAME="410"></A>seemed to be amorous of Demetrius, but Demetrius amorous only of Lamia. 
<A NAME="411"></A>After this signal victory, Demetrius came before Salamis; and Menelaus, 
<A NAME="412"></A>unable to make any resistance, surrendered himself and all his fleet, twelve 
<A NAME="413"></A>hundred horse, and twelve thousand foot, together with the place. But that 
<A NAME="414"></A>which added more than all to the glory and splendour of the success was 
<A NAME="415"></A>the humane and generous conduct of Demetrius to the vanquished. For, after 
<A NAME="416"></A>he had given honourable funerals to the dead, he bestowed liberty upon 
<A NAME="417"></A>the living; and that he might not forget the Athenians, he sent them, as 
<A NAME="418"></A>a present, complete arms for twelve hundred men.
<A NAME="419"></A><BR><BR>To carry this happy news, Aristodemus of Miletus, the most perfect 
<A NAME="420"></A>flatterer belonging to the court, was despatched to Antigonus; and he, 
<A NAME="421"></A>to enhance the welcome message, was resolved, it would appear, to make 
<A NAME="422"></A>his most successful effort. When he crossed from Cyprus, he bade the galley 
<A NAME="423"></A>which conveyed him to come to anchor off the land; and, having ordered 
<A NAME="424"></A>all the ship's crew to remain aboard, he took the boat, and was set ashore 
<A NAME="425"></A>alone. Thus he proceeded to Antigonus, who, one may well imagine, was in 
<A NAME="426"></A>suspense enough about the issue, and suffered all the anxieties natural 
<A NAME="427"></A>to men engaged in so perilous a struggle. And when he heard that Aristodemus 
<A NAME="428"></A>was coming alone, it put him into yet greater trouble; he could scarcely 
<A NAME="429"></A>forbear from going out to meet him himself; he sent messenger on messenger, 
<A NAME="430"></A>and friend after friend, to inquire what news. But Aristodemus, walking 
<A NAME="431"></A>gravely and with a settled countenance, without making any answer, still 
<A NAME="432"></A>proceeded quietly onward; until Antigonus, quite alarmed and no longer 
<A NAME="433"></A>able to refrain, got up and met him at the gate, whither he came with a 
<A NAME="434"></A>crowd of anxious followers now collected and running after him. As soon 
<A NAME="435"></A>as he saw Antigonus within hearing stretching out his hands, he accosted 
<A NAME="436"></A>him with the loud exclamation, "Hail, King Antigonus! we have defeated 
<A NAME="437"></A>Ptolemy by sea, and have taken Cyprus and sixteen thousand eight hundred 
<A NAME="438"></A>prisoners." "Welcome, Aristodemus," replied Antigonus, "but, as you chose 
<A NAME="439"></A>to torture us so long for your good news, you may wait awhile for the reward 
<A NAME="440"></A>of it."
<A NAME="441"></A><BR><BR>Upon this the people around gave Antigonus and Demetrius, for the 
<A NAME="442"></A>first time, the title of kings. His friends at once set a diadem on the 
<A NAME="443"></A>head of Antigonus; and he sent one presently to his son, with a letter 
<A NAME="444"></A>addressed to him as King Demetrius. And when this news was told in Egypt, 
<A NAME="445"></A>that they might not seem to be dejected with the late defeat, Ptolemy's 
<A NAME="446"></A>followers also took occasion to bestow the style of king upon him; and 
<A NAME="447"></A>the rest of the successors of Alexander were quick to follow the example. 
<A NAME="448"></A>Lysimachus began to wear the diadem, and Seleucus, who had before received 
<A NAME="449"></A>the name in all addresses from the barbarians, now also took it upon him 
<A NAME="450"></A>in all business with the Greeks, Cassander still retained his usual superscription 
<A NAME="451"></A>in his letters, but others, both in writing and speaking, gave him the 
<A NAME="452"></A>royal title. Nor was this the mere accession of a name, or introduction 
<A NAME="453"></A>of a new fashion. The men's own sentiments about themselves were disturbed, 
<A NAME="454"></A>and their feelings elevated; a spirit of pomp and arrogance passed into 
<A NAME="455"></A>their habits of life and conversation, as a tragic actor on the stage modifies, 
<A NAME="456"></A>with a change of dress, his steps, his voice, his motions in sitting down, 
<A NAME="457"></A>his manner in addressing another. The punishments they inflicted were more 
<A NAME="458"></A>violent after they had thus laid aside that modest style under which they 
<A NAME="459"></A>formerly dissembled their power, and the influence of which had often made 
<A NAME="460"></A>them gentler and less exacting to their subjects. A single flattering voice 
<A NAME="461"></A>effected a revolution in the world.
<A NAME="462"></A><BR><BR>Antigonus, extremely elevated with the success of his arms in Cyprus, 
<A NAME="463"></A>under the conduct of Demetrius, resolved to push on his good fortune, and 
<A NAME="464"></A>to lead his forces in person against Ptolemy by land whilst Demetrius should 
<A NAME="465"></A>coast with a great fleet along the shore, to assist him by sea. The issue 
<A NAME="466"></A>of the contest was intimated in a dream which Medius, a friend of Antigonus, 
<A NAME="467"></A>had at this time in his sleep. He thought he saw Antigonus and his whole 
<A NAME="468"></A>army running, as if it had been a race; that, in the first part of the 
<A NAME="469"></A>course, he went off showing great strength and speed; gradually, however, 
<A NAME="470"></A>his pace slackened, and at the end he saw him come lagging up, tired and 
<A NAME="471"></A>almost breathless and quite spent. Antigonus himself met with many difficulties 
<A NAME="472"></A>by land; and Demetrius, encountering a great storm at sea, was driven, 
<A NAME="473"></A>with the loss of many of his ships, upon a dangerous coast without a harbour. 
<A NAME="474"></A>So the expedition returned without effecting anything. Antigonus, now nearly 
<A NAME="475"></A>eighty years old, was no longer well able to go through the fatigues of 
<A NAME="476"></A>a marching campaign, though rather on account of his great size and corpulence 
<A NAME="477"></A>than from loss of strength; and for this reason he left things to his son, 
<A NAME="478"></A>whose fortune and experience appeared sufficient for all undertakings, 
<A NAME="479"></A>and whose luxury and expense and revelry gave him no concern. For though 
<A NAME="480"></A>in peace he vented himself in pleasures, and, when there was nothing to 
<A NAME="481"></A>do, ran headlong into any excesses, in war he was as sober and abstemious 
<A NAME="482"></A>as the most temperate character. The story is told that once, after Lamia 
<A NAME="483"></A>had gained open supremacy over him, the old man, when Demetrius coming 
<A NAME="484"></A>home from abroad began to kiss him with unusual warmth, asked him if he 
<A NAME="485"></A>took him for Lamia. At another time, Demetrius, after spending several 
<A NAME="486"></A>days in a debauch, excused himself for his absence, by saying he had had 
<A NAME="487"></A>a violent flux. "So I heard," replied Antigonus; "was it of Thasian wine, 
<A NAME="488"></A>or Chian?" Once he was told his son was ill, and went to see him. At the 
<A NAME="489"></A>door he met some young beauty. Going in, he sat down by the bed and took 
<A NAME="490"></A>his pulse. "The fever," said Demetrius, "has just left me." "Oh yes," replied 
<A NAME="491"></A>the father, "I met it going out at the door." Demetrius's great actions 
<A NAME="492"></A>made Antigonus treat him thus easily. The Scythians in their drinking-bouts 
<A NAME="493"></A>twang their bows, to keep their courage awake amidst the dreams of indulgence; 
<A NAME="494"></A>but he would resign his whole being, now to pleasure, and now to action; 
<A NAME="495"></A>and though he never let thoughts of the one intrude upon the pursuit of 
<A NAME="496"></A>the other, yet when the time came for preparing for war, he showed as much 
<A NAME="497"></A>capacity as any man.
<A NAME="498"></A><BR><BR>And indeed his ability displayed itself even more in preparing 
<A NAME="499"></A>for than in conducting a war. He thought he could never be too well supplied 
<A NAME="500"></A>for every possible occasion, and took a pleasure, not to be satiated, in 
<A NAME="501"></A>great improvements in ship-building and machines. He did not waste his 
<A NAME="502"></A>natural genius and power of mechanical research on toys and idle fancies, 
<A NAME="503"></A>turning, painting, and playing on the flute, like some kings, Aeropus, 
<A NAME="504"></A>for example, King of Macedon, who spent his days in making small lamps 
<A NAME="505"></A>and tables; or Attalus Philometor, whose amusement was to cultivate poisons 
<A NAME="506"></A>henbane and bellebore, and even hemlock, aconite, and dorycnium, which 
<A NAME="507"></A>he used to sow himself in the royal gardens, and made it his business to 
<A NAME="508"></A>gather the fruits and collect the juices in their season. The Parthian 
<A NAME="509"></A>kings took a pride in whetting and sharpening with their own hands the 
<A NAME="510"></A>points of their arrows and javelins. But when Demetrius played the workman, 
<A NAME="511"></A>it was like a king, and there was magnificence in his handicraft. The articles 
<A NAME="512"></A>he produced bore marks upon the face of them not of ingenuity only, but 
<A NAME="513"></A>of a great mind and a lofty purpose. They were such as a king might not 
<A NAME="514"></A>only design and pay for, but use his own hands to make; and while friends 
<A NAME="515"></A>might be terrified with their greatness, enemies could be charmed with 
<A NAME="516"></A>their beauty; a phrase which is not so pretty to the ear as it is true 
<A NAME="517"></A>to the fact. The very people against whom they were to be employed could 
<A NAME="518"></A>not forbear running to gaze with admiration upon his galleys of five and 
<A NAME="519"></A>six ranges of oars, as they passed along their coasts; and the inhabitants 
<A NAME="520"></A>of besieged cities came on their walls to see the spectacles of his famous 
<A NAME="521"></A>City-takers. Even Lysmachus, of all the kings of his time the greatest 
<A NAME="522"></A>enemy of Demetrius, coming to raise the siege of Soli in Cilicia, sent 
<A NAME="523"></A>first to desire permission to see his galleys and engines, and, having 
<A NAME="524"></A>had his curiosity gratified by a view of them, expressed his admiration 
<A NAME="525"></A>and quitted the place. The Rhodians, also, whom he long besieged, begged 
<A NAME="526"></A>him, when they concluded a peace, to let them have some of his engines, 
<A NAME="527"></A>which they might preserve as a memorial at once of his power and of their 
<A NAME="528"></A>own brave resistance.
<A NAME="529"></A><BR><BR>The quarrel between him and the Rhodians was on account of their 
<A NAME="530"></A>being allies to Ptolemy, and in the siege the greatest of all the engines 
<A NAME="531"></A>was planted against their walls. The base of it was exactly square, each 
<A NAME="532"></A>side containing twenty-four cubits; it rose to a height of thirty-three 
<A NAME="533"></A>cubits, growing narrower from the base to the top. Within were several 
<A NAME="534"></A>apartments or chambers, which were to be filled with armed men, and in 
<A NAME="535"></A>every story the front towards the enemy had windows for discharging missiles 
<A NAME="536"></A>of all sorts, the whole being filled with soldiers for every description 
<A NAME="537"></A>of fighting. And what was most wonderful was that, notwithstanding its 
<A NAME="538"></A>size, when it was moved it never tottered or inclined to one side, but 
<A NAME="539"></A>went forward on its base in perfect equilibrium, with a loud noise and 
<A NAME="540"></A>great impetus, astounding the minds, and yet at the same time charming 
<A NAME="541"></A>the eyes of all the beholders.
<A NAME="542"></A><BR><BR>Whilst Demetrius was at this same siege, there were brought to 
<A NAME="543"></A>him two iron cuirasses from Cyprus, weighing each of them on more than 
<A NAME="544"></A>forty pounds, and Zoilus, who had forged them, to show the excellence of 
<A NAME="545"></A>their temper, desired that one of them might be tried with a catapult missile, 
<A NAME="546"></A>shot out of one of the engines at no greater distance than six-and-twenty 
<A NAME="547"></A>paces; and, upon the experiment, it was found that though the dart exactly 
<A NAME="548"></A>hit the cuirass, yet it made no greater impression than such a slight scratch 
<A NAME="549"></A>as might be made with the point of a style or graver. Demetrius took this 
<A NAME="550"></A>for his own wearing, and gave the other to Alcimus the Epirot, the best 
<A NAME="551"></A>soldier and strongest man of all his captains, the only one who used to 
<A NAME="552"></A>wear armour to the weight of two talents, one talent being the weight which 
<A NAME="553"></A>others thought sufficient. He fell during this siege in a battle near the 
<A NAME="554"></A>theatre.
<A NAME="555"></A><BR><BR>The Rhodians made a brave defence, insomuch that Demetrius saw 
<A NAME="556"></A>he was making but little progress, and only persisted out of obstinacy 
<A NAME="557"></A>and passion; and the rather because the Rhodians, having captured a ship 
<A NAME="558"></A>in which some clothes and furniture, with letters from herself, were coming 
<A NAME="559"></A>to him from Phila his wife, had sent on everything to Ptolemy, and had 
<A NAME="560"></A>not copied the honourable example of the Athenians, who, having surprised 
<A NAME="561"></A>an express sent from King Philip, their enemy, opened all the letters he 
<A NAME="562"></A>was charged with, excepting only those directed to Queen Olympias, which 
<A NAME="563"></A>they returned with the seal unbroken. Yet, although greatly provoked, Demetrius, 
<A NAME="564"></A>into whose power it shortly after came to repay the affront, would not 
<A NAME="565"></A>suffer himself to retaliate. Protogenes the Caunian had been making them 
<A NAME="566"></A>a painting of the story of Ialysus, which was all but completed, when it 
<A NAME="567"></A>was taken by Demetrius in one of the suburbs. The Rhodians sent a herald 
<A NAME="568"></A>begging him to be pleased to spare the work and not let it be destroyed; 
<A NAME="569"></A>Demetrius's answer to which was that he would rather burn the pictures 
<A NAME="570"></A>of his father than a piece of art which had cost so much labour. It is 
<A NAME="571"></A>said to have taken Protogenes seven years to paint, and they tell us that 
<A NAME="572"></A>Apelles, when he first saw it, was struck dumb with wonder, and called 
<A NAME="573"></A>it, on recovering his speech, "a great labour and a wonderful success," 
<A NAME="574"></A>adding, however, that it had not the graces which carried his own paintings 
<A NAME="575"></A>as it were up to the heavens. This picture, which came with the rest in 
<A NAME="576"></A>the general mass to Rome, there perished by fire.
<A NAME="577"></A><BR><BR>While the Rhodians were thus defending their city to the utmost, 
<A NAME="578"></A>Demetrius, who was not sorry for an excuse to retire, found one in the 
<A NAME="579"></A>arrival of ambassadors from Athens, by whose mediation terms were made 
<A NAME="580"></A>that the Rhodians should bind themselves to aid Antigonus and Demetrius 
<A NAME="581"></A>against all enemies, Ptolemy excepted.
<A NAME="582"></A><BR><BR>The Athenians entreated his help against Cassander, who was besieging 
<A NAME="583"></A>the city. So he went thither with a fleet of three hundred and thirty ships, 
<A NAME="584"></A>and many soldiers; and not only drove Cassander out of Attica, but pursued 
<A NAME="585"></A>him as far as Thermopylae, routed him and became master of Heraclea, which 
<A NAME="586"></A>came over to him voluntarily, and of a body of six thousand Macedonians, 
<A NAME="587"></A>which also joined him. Returning hence, he gave their liberty to all the 
<A NAME="588"></A>Greeks on this side Thermopylae, and made alliance with the Boeotians, 
<A NAME="589"></A>took Cenchreae, and reducing the fortresses of Phyle and Panactum, in which 
<A NAME="590"></A>were garrisons of Cassander, restored them to the Athenians. They, in requital, 
<A NAME="591"></A>though they had before been so profuse in bestowing honours upon him that 
<A NAME="592"></A>one would have thought they had exhausted all the capacities of invention, 
<A NAME="593"></A>showed they had still new refinements of adulation to devise for him. They 
<A NAME="594"></A>gave him, as his lodging, the back temple in the Parthenon, and here he 
<A NAME="595"></A>lived, under the immediate roof as they meant it to imply, of his hostess, 
<A NAME="596"></A>Minerva- no reputable or well-conducted guest to be quartered upon a maiden 
<A NAME="597"></A>goddess! When his brother Philip was once put into a house where three 
<A NAME="598"></A>young women were living, Antigonus, saying nothing to him, sent for his 
<A NAME="599"></A>quartermaster, and told him, in the young man's presence, to find some 
<A NAME="600"></A>less crowded lodgings for him.
<A NAME="601"></A><BR><BR>Demetrius, however, who should, to say the least, have paid the 
<A NAME="602"></A>goddess the respect due to an elder sister, for that was the purport of 
<A NAME="603"></A>the city's compliment, filled the temple with such pollutions that the 
<A NAME="604"></A>place seemed least profaned when his licence confined itself to common 
<A NAME="605"></A>women like Chrysis, Lamia, Demo, and Anticyra.
<A NAME="606"></A><BR><BR>The fair name of the city forbids any further plain particulars; 
<A NAME="607"></A>let us only record the severe virtue of the young Damocles, surnamed, and 
<A NAME="608"></A>by that surname pointed out to Demetrius, the beautiful; who, to escape 
<A NAME="609"></A>importunities, avoided every place of resort, and when at last followed 
<A NAME="610"></A>into a private bathing room by Demetrius, seeing none at hand to help or 
<A NAME="611"></A>deliver, seized the lid from the cauldron, and, plunging into the boiling 
<A NAME="612"></A>water, sought a death untimely and unmerited, but worthy of the country 
<A NAME="613"></A>and of the beauty that occasioned it. Not so Cleaenetus, the son of Cleomedon, 
<A NAME="614"></A>who, to obtain from Demetrius a letter of intercession to the people in 
<A NAME="615"></A>behalf of his father, lately condemned in a fine of fifty talents, disgraced 
<A NAME="616"></A>himself, and got the city into trouble. In deference to the letter, they 
<A NAME="617"></A>remitted the fine, yet they made an edict prohibiting any citizen for the 
<A NAME="618"></A>future to bring letters from Demetrius. But being informed that Demetrius 
<A NAME="619"></A>resented this as a great indignity, they not only rescinded in alarm the 
<A NAME="620"></A>former order, but put some of the proposers and advisers of it to death 
<A NAME="621"></A>and banished others, and furthermore enacted and decreed, that whatsoever 
<A NAME="622"></A>King Demetrius should in time to come ordain, should be accounted right 
<A NAME="623"></A>towards the gods and just towards men; and when one of the better class 
<A NAME="624"></A>of citizens said Stratocles must be mad to use such words, Demochares of 
<A NAME="625"></A>Leuconoe observed he would be a fool not to be mad. For Stratocles was 
<A NAME="626"></A>well rewarded for his flatteries; and the saying was remembered against 
<A NAME="627"></A>Demochares, who was soon after sent into banishment. So fared the Athenians, 
<A NAME="628"></A>after being relieved of the foreign garrison, and recovering what was called 
<A NAME="629"></A>their liberty.
<A NAME="630"></A><BR><BR>After this Demetrius marched with his forces into Peloponnesus, 
<A NAME="631"></A>where he met with none to oppose him, his enemies flying before him, and 
<A NAME="632"></A>allowing the cities to join him. He received into friendship all Acte, 
<A NAME="633"></A>as it is called, and all Arcadia except Mantinea. He bought the liberty 
<A NAME="634"></A>of Argos, Corinth, and Sicyon, by paying a hundred talents to their garrisons 
<A NAME="635"></A>to evacuate them. At Argos, during the feast of Juno, which happened at 
<A NAME="636"></A>the time, he presided at the games, and, joining in the festivities with 
<A NAME="637"></A>the of the Greeks assembled there, he celebrated his marriage with Deidamia, 
<A NAME="638"></A>daughter of Aeacides, King of the Molossians, and sister of Pyrrhus. At 
<A NAME="639"></A>Sicyon he told the people they had put the city just outside of the city, 
<A NAME="640"></A>and, persuading them to remove to where they now live, gave their town 
<A NAME="641"></A>not only a new site but a new name, Demetrias, after himself. A general 
<A NAME="642"></A>assembly met on the Isthmus, where he was proclaimed, by a great concourse 
<A NAME="643"></A>of the people, the Commander of Greece, like Philip and Alexander of old; 
<A NAME="644"></A>whose superior he, in the present height of his prosperity and power, was 
<A NAME="645"></A>willing enough to consider himself; and certainly, in one respect, he outdid 
<A NAME="646"></A>Alexander, who never refused their title to other kings, or took on himself 
<A NAME="647"></A>the style of king of kings, though many kings received both their title 
<A NAME="648"></A>and their authority as such from him; whereas Demetrius used to ridicule 
<A NAME="649"></A>those who gave the name of king to any except himself and his father; and 
<A NAME="650"></A>in his entertainments was well pleased when his followers, after drinking 
<A NAME="651"></A>to him and his father as kings, went on to drink the healths of Seleucus, 
<A NAME="652"></A>with the title of Master of the Elephants; of Ptolemy, by the name of High 
<A NAME="653"></A>Admiral; of Lysimachus, with the addition of Treasurer; and of Agathocles, 
<A NAME="654"></A>with the style of Governor of the Island of Sicily. The other kings merely 
<A NAME="655"></A>laughed when they were told of this vanity; Lysimachus alone expressed 
<A NAME="656"></A>some indignation at being considered a eunuch, such being usually then 
<A NAME="657"></A>selected for the office of treasurer. And, in general, there was a more 
<A NAME="658"></A>bitter enmity between him and Lysimachus than with any of the others. Once, 
<A NAME="659"></A>as a scoff at his passion for Lamia, Lysimachus said he had never before 
<A NAME="660"></A>seen a courtesan act a queen's part; to which Demetrius rejoined that his 
<A NAME="661"></A>mistress was quite as honest as Lysimachus's own Penelope.
<A NAME="662"></A><BR><BR>But to proceed. Demetrius being about to return to Athens, signified 
<A NAME="663"></A>by letter to the city that he desired immediate admission to the rites 
<A NAME="664"></A>of initiation into the Mysteries, and wished to go through all the stages 
<A NAME="665"></A>of the ceremony, from first to last, without delay. This was absolutely 
<A NAME="666"></A>contrary to the rules, and a thing which had never been allowed before; 
<A NAME="667"></A>for the lesser mysteries were celebrated in the month of Anthesterion, 
<A NAME="668"></A>and the great solemnity in Boedromion, and none of the novices were finally 
<A NAME="669"></A>admitted till they had completed a year after this latter. Yet all this 
<A NAME="670"></A>notwithstanding, when in the public assembly these letters of Demetrius 
<A NAME="671"></A>were produced and read, there was not one single person who had the courage 
<A NAME="672"></A>to oppose them, except Pythodorus, the torch-bearer. But it signified nothing, 
<A NAME="673"></A>for Stratocles at once proposed that the month of Munychion, then current, 
<A NAME="674"></A>should by edict be reputed to be the month of Anthesterion; which being 
<A NAME="675"></A>voted and done, and Demetrius thereby admitted to the lesser ceremonies, 
<A NAME="676"></A>by another vote they turned the same month of Munychion into the other 
<A NAME="677"></A>month of Boedromion; the celebration of the greater mysteries ensued, and 
<A NAME="678"></A>Demetrius was fully admitted. These proceedings gave the comedian, Philippides, 
<A NAME="679"></A>a new occasion to exercise his wit upon Stratocles-
<A NAME="680"></A><BR><BR>"   -whose flattering fear
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>Into one month hath crowded all the year." And on the vote that Demetrius 
<A NAME="682"></A>should lodge in the Parthenon-
<A NAME="683"></A><BR><BR>"Who turns the temple to a common inn,
<A NAME="684"></A><BR>And makes the Virgin's house a house of sin."
<A NAME="685"></A><BR><BR>Of all the disreputable and flagitious acts of which he was guilty 
<A NAME="686"></A>in this visit, one that particularly hurt the feelings of the Athenians 
<A NAME="687"></A>was that, having given command that they should forthwith raise for his 
<A NAME="688"></A>service two hundred and fifty talents, and they to comply with his demands 
<A NAME="689"></A>being forced to levy it upon the people with the utmost rigour and severity, 
<A NAME="690"></A>when they presented him with the money which they had with such difficulty 
<A NAME="691"></A>raised, as if it were a trifling sum, he ordered it to be given to Lamia 
<A NAME="692"></A>and the rest of his women, to buy soap. The loss, which was bad enough, 
<A NAME="693"></A>was less galling than the shame, and the words more intolerable than the 
<A NAME="694"></A>act which they accompanied. Though, indeed, the story is variously reported; 
<A NAME="695"></A>and some say it was the Thessalians, and not the Athenians, who were thus 
<A NAME="696"></A>treated. Lamia, however, exacted contributions herself to pay for an entertainment 
<A NAME="697"></A>she gave to the king, and her banquet was so renowned for its sumptuosity 
<A NAME="698"></A>that a description of it was drawn up by the Samian writer, Lynceus. Upon 
<A NAME="699"></A>this occasion, one of the comic writers gave Lamia the name of the real 
<A NAME="700"></A>Helepolis; and Demochares of Soli called Demetrius Mythus, because the 
<A NAME="701"></A>fable always has its Lamia, and so had he.
<A NAME="702"></A><BR><BR>And, in truth, his passion for this woman, and the prosperity in 
<A NAME="703"></A>which she lived were such as to draw upon him not only the envy and jealousy 
<A NAME="704"></A>of all his wives, but the animosity even of his friends. For example, on 
<A NAME="705"></A>Lysimachus's showing to some ambassadors from Demetrius the scars of the 
<A NAME="706"></A>wounds which he had received upon his thighs and arms by the paws of the 
<A NAME="707"></A>lion with which Alexander had shut him up, after hearing his account of 
<A NAME="708"></A>the combat, they smiled and answered, that their king, also, was not without 
<A NAME="709"></A>his scars, but could show upon his neck the marks of a Lamia, a no less 
<A NAME="710"></A>dangerous beast. It was also matter of wonder that, though he had objected 
<A NAME="711"></A>so much to Phila on account of her age, he was yet such a slave to Lamia 
<A NAME="712"></A>who was so long past her prime. One evening at supper, when she played 
<A NAME="713"></A>the flute, Demetrius asked Demo, whom the men called Madness, what she 
<A NAME="714"></A>thought of her. Demo answered she thought her an old woman. And when a 
<A NAME="715"></A>quantity of sweetmeats were brought in, and the king said again, "See what 
<A NAME="716"></A>presents I get from Lamia!" "My old mother," answered Demo, "will send 
<A NAME="717"></A>you more, if you will make her your mistress." Another story is told of 
<A NAME="718"></A>a criticism passed by Lamia on the famous judgment of Bocchoris. A young 
<A NAME="719"></A>Egyptian had long made suit to Thonis, the courtesan, offering a sum of 
<A NAME="720"></A>gold for her favour. But before it came to pass, he dreamed one night that 
<A NAME="721"></A>he had obtained it, and, satisfied with the shadow, felt no more desire 
<A NAME="722"></A>for the substance. Thonis upon this brought an action for the sum. Bocchoris, 
<A NAME="723"></A>the judge, on hearing the case, ordered the defendant to bring into court 
<A NAME="724"></A>the full amount in a vessel, which he was to move to and fro in his hand, 
<A NAME="725"></A>and the shadow of it was to be adjudged to Thonis. The fairness of this 
<A NAME="726"></A>sentence Lamia contested, saying the young man's desire might have been 
<A NAME="727"></A>satisfied with the dream, but Thonis's desire for the money could not be 
<A NAME="728"></A>relieved by the shadow. Thus much for Lamia.
<A NAME="729"></A><BR><BR>And now the story passes from the comic to the tragic stage in 
<A NAME="730"></A>pursuit of the acts and fortunes of its subjects. A general league of the 
<A NAME="731"></A>kings, who were now gathering and combining their forces to attack Antigonus, 
<A NAME="732"></A>recalled Demetrius from Greece. He was encouraged by finding his father 
<A NAME="733"></A>full of a spirit and resolution for the combat that belied his years. Yet 
<A NAME="734"></A>it would seem to be true, that if Antigonus could only have borne to make 
<A NAME="735"></A>some trifling concessions, and if he had shown any moderation in his passion 
<A NAME="736"></A>for empire, he might have maintained for himself till his death and left 
<A NAME="737"></A>to his son behind him the first place among the kings. But he was of a 
<A NAME="738"></A>violent and haughty spirit; and the insulting words as well as actions 
<A NAME="739"></A>in which he allowed himself could not be borne by young and powerful princes, 
<A NAME="740"></A>and provoked them into combining against him. Though now when he was told 
<A NAME="741"></A>of the confederacy, he could not forbear from saying that this flock of 
<A NAME="742"></A>birds would soon be scattered by one stone and a single shout. He took 
<A NAME="743"></A>the field at the head of more than seventy thousand foot, and of ten thousand 
<A NAME="744"></A>horse, and seventy-five elephants. His enemies had sixty-four thousand 
<A NAME="745"></A>foot, five hundred more horse than he, elephants to the number of four 
<A NAME="746"></A>hundred, and a hundred and twenty chariots. On their near approach to each 
<A NAME="747"></A>other, an alteration began to be observable, not in the purposes, but in 
<A NAME="748"></A>the presentiments of Antigonus. For whereas in all former campaigns he 
<A NAME="749"></A>had ever shown himself lofty and confident, loud in voice and scornful 
<A NAME="750"></A>in speech, often by some joke or mockery on the eve of battle expressing 
<A NAME="751"></A>his contempt and displaying his composure, he was now remarked to be thoughtful, 
<A NAME="752"></A>silent, and retired. He presented Demetrius to the army and declared him 
<A NAME="753"></A>his successor; and what every one thought stranger than all was that he 
<A NAME="754"></A>now conferred alone in his tent with Demetrius; whereas in former time 
<A NAME="755"></A>he had never entered into any secret consultations even with him; but had 
<A NAME="756"></A>always followed his own advice, made his resolutions, and then given out 
<A NAME="757"></A>his commands. Once when Demetrius was a boy and asked him how soon the 
<A NAME="758"></A>army would move, he is said to have answered him sharply, "Are you afraid 
<A NAME="759"></A>lest you, of all the army, should not hear the trumpet?"
<A NAME="760"></A><BR><BR>There were now, however, inauspicious signs, which affected his 
<A NAME="761"></A>spirits. Demetrius, in a dream, had seen Alexander, completely armed, appear 
<A NAME="762"></A>and demand of him what word they intended to give in the time of the battle; 
<A NAME="763"></A>and Demetrius answering that he intended the word should he "Jupiter and 
<A NAME="764"></A>Victory," "Then," said Alexander, "I will go to your adversaries and find 
<A NAME="765"></A>my welcome with them." And on the morning of the combat, as the armies 
<A NAME="766"></A>were drawing up, Antigonus, going out of the door of his tent, by some 
<A NAME="767"></A>accident or other stumbled and fell flat upon the ground, hurting himself 
<A NAME="768"></A>a good deal. And on recovering his feet, lifting up his hands to heaven, 
<A NAME="769"></A>he prayed the gods to grant him, "either victory, or death without knowledge 
<A NAME="770"></A>of defeat." When the armies engaged, Demetrius, who commanded the greatest 
<A NAME="771"></A>and best part of the cavalry, made a charge on Antiochus, the son of Seleucus, 
<A NAME="772"></A>and gloriously routing the enemy, followed the pursuit, in the pride and 
<A NAME="773"></A>exultation of success, so eagerly, and so unwisely far, that it fatally 
<A NAME="774"></A>lost him the day; for when, perceiving his error, he would have come in 
<A NAME="775"></A>to the assistance of his own infantry, he was not able, the enemy with 
<A NAME="776"></A>their elephants having cut off his retreat. And on the other hand, Seleucus, 
<A NAME="777"></A>observing the main battle of Antigonus left naked of their horse, did not 
<A NAME="778"></A>charge, but made a show of charging; and keeping them in alarm and wheeling 
<A NAME="779"></A>about and still threatening an attack, he gave opportunity for those who 
<A NAME="780"></A>wished it to separate and come over to him; which a large body of them 
<A NAME="781"></A>did, the rest taking to flight. But the old King Antigonus still kept his 
<A NAME="782"></A>post, and when a strong body of the enemies drew up to charge him, and 
<A NAME="783"></A>one of those about him cried out to him, "Sir, they are coming upon you," 
<A NAME="784"></A>he only replied, "What else should they do? but Demetrius will come to 
<A NAME="785"></A>my rescue." And in this hope he persisted to the last, looking out on every 
<A NAME="786"></A>side for his son's approach, until he was borne down by a whole multitude 
<A NAME="787"></A>of darts, and fell. His other followers and friends fled, and Thorax of 
<A NAME="788"></A>Larissa remained alone by the body.
<A NAME="789"></A><BR><BR>The battle having been thus decided, the kings who had gained the 
<A NAME="790"></A>victory, carving up the whole vast empire that had belonged to Demetrius 
<A NAME="791"></A>and Antigonus, like a carcass, into so many portions, added these new gains 
<A NAME="792"></A>to their former possessions. As for Demetrius, with five thousand foot 
<A NAME="793"></A>and four thousand horse, he fled at his utmost speed to Ephesus, where 
<A NAME="794"></A>it was the common opinion he would seize the treasures of the temple to 
<A NAME="795"></A>relieve his wants; but he, on the contrary, fearing such an attempt on 
<A NAME="796"></A>the part of his soldiers, hastened away, and sailed for Greece, his chief 
<A NAME="797"></A>remaining hopes being placed in the fidelity of the Athenians, with whom 
<A NAME="798"></A>he had left part of his navy and of his treasures and his wife Deidamia. 
<A NAME="799"></A>And in their attachment he had not the least doubt but he should in this 
<A NAME="800"></A>his extremity find a safe resource. Accordingly when, upon reaching the 
<A NAME="801"></A>Cyclades, he was met by ambassadors from Athens, requesting him not to 
<A NAME="802"></A>proceed to the city, as the people had passed a vote to admit no king whatever 
<A NAME="803"></A>within their walls, and had conveyed Deidamia with honourable attendance 
<A NAME="804"></A>to Megara, his anger and surprise overpowered him, and the constancy quite 
<A NAME="805"></A>failed him which he had hitherto shown in a wonderful degree under his 
<A NAME="806"></A>reverses, nothing humiliating or mean-spirited having as yet been seen 
<A NAME="807"></A>in him under all his misfortunes. But to be thus disappointed in the Athenians, 
<A NAME="808"></A>and to find the friendship he had trusted prove, upon trial, thus empty 
<A NAME="809"></A>and unreal, was a great pang to him. And, in truth, an excessive display 
<A NAME="810"></A>of outward honour would seem to be the most uncertain attestation of the 
<A NAME="811"></A>real affection of a people for any king or potentate. Such shows lose their 
<A NAME="812"></A>whole credit as tokens of affection (which has its virtue in the feelings 
<A NAME="813"></A>and moral choice), when we reflect that they may equally proceed from fear. 
<A NAME="814"></A>The same decrees are voted upon the latter motive as upon the former. And 
<A NAME="815"></A>therefore judicious men do not look so much to statues, paintings, or divine 
<A NAME="816"></A>honours that are paid them, as to their own actions and conduct, judging 
<A NAME="817"></A>hence whether they shall trust these as a genuine, or discredit them as 
<A NAME="818"></A>a forced homage. As in fact nothing is less unusual than for a people, 
<A NAME="819"></A>even while offering compliments, to be disgusted with those who accept 
<A NAME="820"></A>them greedily, or arrogantly, or without respect to the free-will of the 
<A NAME="821"></A>givers.
<A NAME="822"></A><BR><BR>Demetrius, shamefully used as he thought himself, was in no condition 
<A NAME="823"></A>to revenge the affront. He returned a message of gentle expostulation, 
<A NAME="824"></A>saying, however, that he expected to have his galleys sent to him, among 
<A NAME="825"></A>which was that of thirteen banks of oars. And this being accorded him, 
<A NAME="826"></A>he sailed to the Isthmus, and, finding his affairs in very ill condition, 
<A NAME="827"></A>his garrisons expelled, and a general secession going on to the enemy, 
<A NAME="828"></A>he left Pyrrhus to attend to Greece, and took his course to the Chersonesus, 
<A NAME="829"></A>where he ravaged the territories of Lysimachus, and by the booty which 
<A NAME="830"></A>he took, maintained and kept together his troops, which were now once more 
<A NAME="831"></A>beginning to recover and to show some considerable front. Nor did any of 
<A NAME="832"></A>the other princes care to meddle with him on that side; for Lysimachus 
<A NAME="833"></A>had quite as little claim to be loved, and was more to be feared for his 
<A NAME="834"></A>power. But not long after Seleucus sent to treat with Demetrius for a marriage 
<A NAME="835"></A>betwixt himself and Stratonice, daughter of Demetrius by Phila. Seleucus, 
<A NAME="836"></A>indeed, had already, by Apama, the Persian, a son named Antiochus, but 
<A NAME="837"></A>he was possessed of territories that might well satisfy more than one successor, 
<A NAME="838"></A>and he was the rather induced to this alliance with Demetrius, because 
<A NAME="839"></A>Lysimachus had just married himself to one daughter of King Ptolemy, and 
<A NAME="840"></A>his son Agathocles to another. Demetrius, who looked upon the offer as 
<A NAME="841"></A>an unexpected piece of good fortune, presently embarked with his daughter, 
<A NAME="842"></A>and with his whole fleet sailed for Syria. Having during his voyage to 
<A NAME="843"></A>touch several times on the coast, among other places he landed in part 
<A NAME="844"></A>of Cilicia, which by the apportionment of the kings after the defeat of 
<A NAME="845"></A>Antigonus was allotted to Plistarchus, the brother of Cassander. Plistarchus, 
<A NAME="846"></A>who took this descent of Demetrius upon his coasts as an infraction of 
<A NAME="847"></A>his rights, and was not sorry to have something to complain of, hastened 
<A NAME="848"></A>to expostulate in person with Seleucus for entering separately into relations 
<A NAME="849"></A>with Demetrius, the common enemy, without consulting the other 
<A NAME="850"></A>kings.
<A NAME="851"></A><BR><BR>Demetrius, receiving information of this, seized the opportunity, 
<A NAME="852"></A>and fell upon the city of Quinda, which he surprised, and took in it twelve 
<A NAME="853"></A>hundred talents still remaining of the treasure. With this prize, he hastened 
<A NAME="854"></A>back to his galleys, embarked, and set sail. At Rhosus, where his wife 
<A NAME="855"></A>Phila was now with him, he was met by Seleucus, and their communications 
<A NAME="856"></A>with each other at once were put on a frank, unsuspecting, and kingly footing. 
<A NAME="857"></A>First, Seleucus gave a banquet to Demetrius in his tent in the camp; then 
<A NAME="858"></A>Demetrius' received him in the ship of thirteen banks of oars. Meetings 
<A NAME="859"></A>for amusements, conferences, and long visits for general intercourse succeeded, 
<A NAME="860"></A>all without attendants or arms; until at length Seleucus took his leave, 
<A NAME="861"></A>and in great state conducted Stratonice to Antioch. Demetrius meantime 
<A NAME="862"></A>possessed himself of Cilicia, and sent Phila to her brother Cassander, 
<A NAME="863"></A>to answer the complaints of Plistarchus. And here his wife Deidamia came 
<A NAME="864"></A>by sea out of Greece to meet him, but not long after contracted an illness, 
<A NAME="865"></A>of which she died. After her death, Demetrius, by the mediation of Seleucus, 
<A NAME="866"></A>became reconciled to Ptolemy, and an agreement was made that he should 
<A NAME="867"></A>marry his daughter Ptolemais. Thus far all was handsomely done on the part 
<A NAME="868"></A>of Seleucus. But, shortly after, desiring to have the province of Cilicia 
<A NAME="869"></A>from Demetrius for a sum of money, and being refused it, he then angrily 
<A NAME="870"></A>demanded of him the cities of Tyre and Sidon, which seemed a mere piece 
<A NAME="871"></A>of arbitrary dealing, and, indeed, an outrageous thing that he, who was 
<A NAME="872"></A>possessed of all the vast provinces between India and the Syrian sea, should 
<A NAME="873"></A>think himself so poorly off as, for the sake of two cities which he coveted, 
<A NAME="874"></A>to disturb the peace of his dear connection, already a sufferer under a 
<A NAME="875"></A>severe reverse of fortune. However, he did but justify the saying of Plato, 
<A NAME="876"></A>that the only certain way to be truly rich is not to have more property, 
<A NAME="877"></A>but fewer desires. For whoever is always grasping at more avows that he 
<A NAME="878"></A>is still in want, and must be poor in the midst of affluence.
<A NAME="879"></A><BR><BR>But Demetrius, whose courage did not sink, resolutely sent him 
<A NAME="880"></A>answer, that, though he were to lose ten thousand battles like that of 
<A NAME="881"></A>Ipsus, he would pay no price for the good-will of such a son-in-law as 
<A NAME="882"></A>Seleucus. He reinforced these cities with sufficient garrisons to enable 
<A NAME="883"></A>them to make a defence against Seleucus; and, receiving information that 
<A NAME="884"></A>Lachares, taking the opportunity of their civil dissensions, had set up 
<A NAME="885"></A>himself as a usurper over the Athenians, he imagined that if he made a 
<A NAME="886"></A>sudden attempt upon the city, he might now without difficulty get possession 
<A NAME="887"></A>of it. He crossed the sea in safety with a large fleet; but passing along 
<A NAME="888"></A>the coast of Attica, was met by a violent storm, and lost the greater number 
<A NAME="889"></A>of his ships, and a very considerable body of men on board of them. As 
<A NAME="890"></A>for him, he escaped, and began to make war in a petty manner with the Athenians, 
<A NAME="891"></A>but, finding himself unable to effect his design, he sent back orders for 
<A NAME="892"></A>raising another fleet, and, with the troops which he had, marched into 
<A NAME="893"></A>Peloponnesus and laid siege to the city of Messena. In attacking which 
<A NAME="894"></A>place he was in danger of death; for a missile from an engine struck him 
<A NAME="895"></A>in the face, and passed through the cheek into his mouth. He recovered, 
<A NAME="896"></A>however, and, as soon as he was in a condition to take the field, won over 
<A NAME="897"></A>divers cities which had revolted from him, and made an incursion into Attica, 
<A NAME="898"></A>where he took Eleusis and Rhamnus, and wasted the country thereabout. And 
<A NAME="899"></A>that he might straiten the Athenians by cutting off all manner of provision, 
<A NAME="900"></A>a vessel laden with corn bound thither falling into his hands, he ordered 
<A NAME="901"></A>the master and the supercargo to be immediately hanged, thereby to strike 
<A NAME="902"></A>a terror into others, that so they might not venture to supply the city 
<A NAME="903"></A>with provisions. By which means they were reduced to such extremities that 
<A NAME="904"></A>a bushel of salt sold for forty drachmas, and a peck of wheat for three 
<A NAME="905"></A>hundred. Ptolemy had sent to their relief a hundred and fifty galleys, 
<A NAME="906"></A>which came so near as to be seen off Aegina; but this brief hope was soon 
<A NAME="907"></A>extinguished by the arrival of three hundred ships, which came to reinforce 
<A NAME="908"></A>Demetrius from Cyprus, Peloponnesus, and other places; upon which Ptolemy's 
<A NAME="909"></A>fleet took to flight, and Lachares, the tyrant, ran away, leaving the city 
<A NAME="910"></A>to its fate.
<A NAME="911"></A><BR><BR>And now the Athenians, who before had made it capital for any person 
<A NAME="912"></A>to propose a treaty or accommodation with Demetrius, immediately opened 
<A NAME="913"></A>the nearest gates to send ambassadors to him, not so much out of hopes 
<A NAME="914"></A>of obtaining any honourable conditions from his clemency as out of necessity, 
<A NAME="915"></A>to avoid death by famine. For among many frightful instances of the distress 
<A NAME="916"></A>they were reduced to, it is said that a father and son were sitting in 
<A NAME="917"></A>a room together, having abandoned every hope, when a dead mouse fell from 
<A NAME="918"></A>the ceiling; and for this prize they leaped up and came to blows. In this 
<A NAME="919"></A>famine, it is also related, the philosopher Epicurus saved his own life, 
<A NAME="920"></A>and the lives of his scholars, by a small quantity of beans, which he distributed 
<A NAME="921"></A>to them daily by number.
<A NAME="922"></A><BR><BR>In this condition was the city when Demetrius made his entrance 
<A NAME="923"></A>and issued a proclamation that all the inhabitants should assemble in the 
<A NAME="924"></A>theatre; which being done, he drew up his soldiers at the back of the stage, 
<A NAME="925"></A>occupied the stage itself with his guards, and, presently coming in himself 
<A NAME="926"></A>by the actors' passages, when the people's consternation had risen to its 
<A NAME="927"></A>height, with his first words he put an end to it. Without any harshness 
<A NAME="928"></A>of tone or bitterness of words, he reprehended them in a gentle and friendly 
<A NAME="929"></A>way, and declared himself reconciled, adding a present of a hundred thousand 
<A NAME="930"></A>bushels of wheat, and appointing as magistrates persons acceptable to the 
<A NAME="931"></A>people. So Dromoclides, the orator, seeing the people at a loss how to 
<A NAME="932"></A>express their gratitude by any words or acclamations, and ready for anything 
<A NAME="933"></A>that would outdo the verbal encomiums of the public speakers, came forward, 
<A NAME="934"></A>and moved a decree for delivering Piraeus and Munychia into the hands of 
<A NAME="935"></A>King Demetrius. This was passed accordingly, and Demetrius, of his own 
<A NAME="936"></A>motion, added a third garrison, which he placed in the Museum, as a precaution 
<A NAME="937"></A>against any new restiveness on the part of the people, which might give 
<A NAME="938"></A>him the trouble of quitting his other enterprises.
<A NAME="939"></A><BR><BR>He had not long been master of Athens before he had formed designs 
<A NAME="940"></A>against Lacedaemon; of which Archidamus, the king, being advertised, came 
<A NAME="941"></A>out and met him, but he was overthrown in a battle near Mantinea; after 
<A NAME="942"></A>which Demetrius entered Laconia, and, in a second battle near Sparta itself, 
<A NAME="943"></A>defeated him again with the loss of two hundred Lacedaemonians slain, and 
<A NAME="944"></A>five hundred taken prisoners. And now it was almost impossible for the 
<A NAME="945"></A>city, which hitherto had never been captured, to escape his arms. But certainly 
<A NAME="946"></A>there never was any king upon whom fortune made such short turns, nor any 
<A NAME="947"></A>other life or story so filled with her swift and surprising changes, over 
<A NAME="948"></A>and over again, from small things to great, from splendour back to humiliation 
<A NAME="949"></A>and from utter weakness once more to power and might. They say in his sadder 
<A NAME="950"></A>vicissitudes he used sometimes to apostrophize fortune in the words of 
<A NAME="951"></A>Aeschylus-
<A NAME="952"></A><BR><BR>"Thou liftest up, to cast us down again." And so at this moment, 
<A NAME="953"></A>when all things seemed to conspire together to give him his heart's desire 
<A NAME="954"></A>of dominion and power, news arrived that Lysimachus had taken all his cities 
<A NAME="955"></A>in Asia, that Ptolemy had reduced all Cyprus with the exception of Salamis, 
<A NAME="956"></A>and that in Salamis his mother and children were shut up and close besieged; 
<A NAME="957"></A>and yet, like the woman in Archilochus-
<A NAME="958"></A><BR><BR>"Water in one deceitful hand she shows,
<A NAME="959"></A><BR>While burning fire within her other glows." The same fortune that drew 
<A NAME="960"></A>him off with these disastrous tidings from Sparta, in a moment after opened 
<A NAME="961"></A>upon him a new and wonderful prospect, of the following kind. Cassander, 
<A NAME="962"></A>King of Macedon, dying, and his eldest son Philip, who succeeded him, not 
<A NAME="963"></A>long surviving his father, the two younger brothers fell at variance concerning 
<A NAME="964"></A>the succession. And Antipater having murdered his mother Thessalonica, 
<A NAME="965"></A>Alexander, the younger brother, called in to his assistance Pyrrhus out 
<A NAME="966"></A>of Epirus, and Demetrius out of the Peloponnese. Pyrrhus arrived first, 
<A NAME="967"></A>and, taking in recompense for his succour a large slice of Macedonia, had 
<A NAME="968"></A>made Alexander begin to be aware that he had brought upon himself a dangerous 
<A NAME="969"></A>neighbour. And, that he might not run a yet worse hazard from Demetrius, 
<A NAME="970"></A>whose power and reputation were so great, the young man hurried away to 
<A NAME="971"></A>meet him at Dium, whither he, who on receiving his letter had set out on 
<A NAME="972"></A>his march, was now come. And, offering his greetings and grateful acknowledgments, 
<A NAME="973"></A>he at the same time informed him that his affairs no longer required the 
<A NAME="974"></A>presence of his ally, thereupon he invited him to supper. There were not 
<A NAME="975"></A>wanting some feelings of suspicion on either side already; and when Demetrius 
<A NAME="976"></A>was now on his way to the banquet, some one came and told him that in the 
<A NAME="977"></A>midst of the drinking he would be killed. Demetrius showed little concern, 
<A NAME="978"></A>but, making only a little less haste, he sent to the principal officers 
<A NAME="979"></A>of his army commanding them to draw out the soldiers, and make them stand 
<A NAME="980"></A>to their arms, and ordered his retinue (more numerous a good deal than 
<A NAME="981"></A>that of Alexander) to attend him into the very room of the entertainment, 
<A NAME="982"></A>and not to stir from thence till they saw him rise from the table. Thus 
<A NAME="983"></A>Alexander's servants, finding themselves overpowered, had not courage to 
<A NAME="984"></A>attempt anything. And, indeed, Demetrius gave them no opportunity, for 
<A NAME="985"></A>he made a very short visit, and pretending to Alexander that he was not 
<A NAME="986"></A>at present in health for drinking wine, left early. And the next day he 
<A NAME="987"></A>occupied himself in preparations for departing, telling Alexander he had 
<A NAME="988"></A>received intelligence that obliged him to leave, begging him to excuse 
<A NAME="989"></A>so sudden a parting; he would hope to see him further when his affairs 
<A NAME="990"></A>allowed him leisure. Alexander was only too glad, not only that he was 
<A NAME="991"></A>going, but that he was doing so of his own motion, without any offence, 
<A NAME="992"></A>and proposed to accompany him into Thessaly. But when they came to Larissa, 
<A NAME="993"></A>new invitations passed between them, new professions of good-will, covering 
<A NAME="994"></A>new conspiracies; by which Alexander put himself into the power of Demetrius. 
<A NAME="995"></A>For as he did not like to use precautions on his own part, for fear Demetrius 
<A NAME="996"></A>should take the hint to use them on his, the very thing he meant to use 
<A NAME="997"></A>was first done to him. He accepted an invitation, and came to Demetrius's 
<A NAME="998"></A>quarters; and when Demetrius, while they were still supping, rose from 
<A NAME="999"></A>the table and went forth, the young man rose also, and followed him to 
<A NAME="1000"></A>the door, where Demetrius, as he passed through, only said to the guards, 
<A NAME="1001"></A>"Kill him that follows me," and went on; and Alexander was at once despatched 
<A NAME="1002"></A>by them, together with such of his friends as endeavoured to come to his 
<A NAME="1003"></A>rescue, one of whom, before he died, said, "You have been one day too quick 
<A NAME="1004"></A>for us."
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR><BR>The night following was one, as may be supposed, of disorder and 
<A NAME="1006"></A>confusion. And with the morning, the Macedonians, still in alarm, and fearful 
<A NAME="1007"></A>of the forces of Demetrius, on finding no violence offered, but only a 
<A NAME="1008"></A>message sent from Demetrius desiring an interview and opportunity for explanation 
<A NAME="1009"></A>of his actions, at last began to feel pretty confident again, and prepared 
<A NAME="1010"></A>to receive him favourably. And when he came, there was no need of much 
<A NAME="1011"></A>being said; their hatred of Antipater for his murder of his mother, and 
<A NAME="1012"></A>the absence of any one better to govern them, soon decided them to proclaim 
<A NAME="1013"></A>Demetrius King of Macedon. And into Macedonia they at once started and 
<A NAME="1014"></A>took him. And the Macedonians at home, who had not forgotten or forgiven 
<A NAME="1015"></A>the wicked deeds committed by Cassander on the family of Alexander, were 
<A NAME="1016"></A>far from sorry at the change. Any kind recollections that still might subsist 
<A NAME="1017"></A>of the plain and simple rule of the first Antipater went also to the benefit 
<A NAME="1018"></A>of Demetrius, whose wife was Phila, his daughter, and his son by her, a 
<A NAME="1019"></A>boy already old enough to be serving in the army with his father, was the 
<A NAME="1020"></A>natural successor to the government.
<A NAME="1021"></A><BR><BR>To add to this unexpected good fortune, news arrived that Ptolemy 
<A NAME="1022"></A>had dismissed his mother and children, bestowing upon them presents and 
<A NAME="1023"></A>honours; and also that his daughter Stratonice, whom he had married to 
<A NAME="1024"></A>Seleucus, was remarried to Antiochus, the son of Seleucus, and proclaimed 
<A NAME="1025"></A>Queen of Upper Asia.
<A NAME="1026"></A><BR><BR>For Antiochus, it appears, had fallen passionately in love with 
<A NAME="1027"></A>Stratonice, the young queen, who had already made Seleucus the father of 
<A NAME="1028"></A>a son. He struggled very hard with the beginning of this passion, and at 
<A NAME="1029"></A>last, resolving with himself that his desires were wholly unlawful, his 
<A NAME="1030"></A>malady past all cure, and his powers of reason too feeble to act, he determined 
<A NAME="1031"></A>on death, and thought to bring his life slowly to extinction by neglecting 
<A NAME="1032"></A>his person and refusing nourishment, under the pretence of being ill. Erasistratus, 
<A NAME="1033"></A>the physician who attended him, quickly perceived that love was his distemper, 
<A NAME="1034"></A>but the difficulty was to discover the object. He therefore waited continually 
<A NAME="1035"></A>in his chamber, and when any of the beauties of the court made their visit 
<A NAME="1036"></A>to the sick prince, he observed the emotions and alterations in the countenance 
<A NAME="1037"></A>of Antiochus, and watched for the changes which he knew to be indicative 
<A NAME="1038"></A>of the inward passions and inclinations of the soul. He took notice that 
<A NAME="1039"></A>the presence of other women produced no effect upon him; but when Stratonice 
<A NAME="1040"></A>came, as she often did, alone, or in company with Seleucus, to see him, 
<A NAME="1041"></A>he observed in him all Sappho's famous symptoms,- his voice faltered, his 
<A NAME="1042"></A>face flushed up, his eyes glanced stealthily, a sudden sweat broke out 
<A NAME="1043"></A>on his skin, the beatings of his heart were irregular and violent, and, 
<A NAME="1044"></A>unable to support the excess of his passion, he would sink into a state 
<A NAME="1045"></A>of faintness, prostration, and pallor.
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR><BR>Erasistratus, reasoning upon these symptoms, and, upon the probabilities 
<A NAME="1047"></A>of things, considering that the king's son would hardly, if the object 
<A NAME="1048"></A>of his passion had been any other, have persisted to death rather than 
<A NAME="1049"></A>reveal it, felt, however, the difficulty of making a discovery of this 
<A NAME="1050"></A>nature to Seleucus. But, trusting to the tenderness of Seleucus for the 
<A NAME="1051"></A>young man, he put on all the assurances he could, and at last, on some 
<A NAME="1052"></A>opportunity, spoke out and told him the malady was love, a love impossible 
<A NAME="1053"></A>to gratify or relieve. The king was extremely surprised, and asked, "Why 
<A NAME="1054"></A>impossible to relieve?" "The fact is," replied Erasistratus, "he is in 
<A NAME="1055"></A>love with my wife." "How!" said Seleusus, "and will our friend Erasistratus 
<A NAME="1056"></A>refuse to bestow his wife upon my son and only successor, when there is 
<A NAME="1057"></A>no other way to save his life?" "You," replied Erasistratus, "who are his 
<A NAME="1058"></A>father, would not do so, if he were in love with Stratonice." "Ah, my friend," 
<A NAME="1059"></A>answered Seleucus, "would to heaven any means, human or divine, could but 
<A NAME="1060"></A>convert his present passion to that; it would be well for me to part not 
<A NAME="1061"></A>only with Stratonice, but with my empire, to save Antiochus." This he said 
<A NAME="1062"></A>with the greatest passion, shedding tears as he spoke; upon which Erasistratus, 
<A NAME="1063"></A>taking him by the hand, replied, "In that case, you have no need of Erasistratus; 
<A NAME="1064"></A>for you, who are the husband, the father, and the king, are the proper 
<A NAME="1065"></A>physician for your own family." Seleucus, accordingly, summoning a general 
<A NAME="1066"></A>assembly of his people, declared to them, that he had resolved to make 
<A NAME="1067"></A>Antiochus king, and Stratonice queen, of all the provinces of Upper Asia, 
<A NAME="1068"></A>uniting them in marriage; telling them, that he thought he had sufficient 
<A NAME="1069"></A>power over the prince's will that he should find in him no repugnance to 
<A NAME="1070"></A>obey his commands; and for Stratonice, he hoped all his friends would endeavour 
<A NAME="1071"></A>to make her sensible, if she should manifest any reluctance to such a marriage, 
<A NAME="1072"></A>that she ought to esteem those things just and honourable which had been 
<A NAME="1073"></A>determined upon by the king as necessary to the general good. In this manner, 
<A NAME="1074"></A>we are told, was brought about the marriage of Antiochus and 
<A NAME="1075"></A>Stratonice.
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR><BR>To return to the affairs of Demetrius. Having obtained the crown 
<A NAME="1077"></A>of Macedon, he presently became master of Thessaly also. And holding the 
<A NAME="1078"></A>greatest part of Peloponnesus, and, on this side of the Isthmus, the cities 
<A NAME="1079"></A>of Megara and Athens, he now turned his arms against the Boeotians. They 
<A NAME="1080"></A>at first made overtures for an accommodation; but Cleonymus of Sparta having 
<A NAME="1081"></A>ventured with some troops to their assistance, and having made his way 
<A NAME="1082"></A>into Thebes, and Pisis, the Thespian, who was their first man in power 
<A NAME="1083"></A>and reputation, animating them to make a brave resistance, they broke off
