<BR>(died 219 B.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Thus fell Agis. His brother Archidamus was too quick for Leonidas, and 
<A NAME="11"></A>saved himself by a timely retreat. But his wife, then mother of a young 
<A NAME="12"></A>child, he forced from her own house, and compelled Agiatis, for that was 
<A NAME="13"></A>her name, to marry his son Cleomenes, though at that time too young for 
<A NAME="14"></A>a wife, because he was unwilling that any one else should have her, being 
<A NAME="15"></A>heiress to her father Gylippus's great estate; in person the most youthful 
<A NAME="16"></A>and beautiful woman in all Greece and well-conducted in her habits of life. 
<A NAME="17"></A>And therefore, they say, she did all she could that she might not be compelled 
<A NAME="18"></A>to this new marriage. But being thus united to Cleomenes, she indeed hated 
<A NAME="19"></A>Leonidas, but to the youth showed herself a kind and obliging wife. He, 
<A NAME="20"></A>as soon as they came together, began to love her very much, and the constant 
<A NAME="21"></A>kindness that she still retained for the memory of Agis brought somewhat 
<A NAME="22"></A>of the like feeling in the young man for him, so that he would often inquire 
<A NAME="23"></A>of her concerning what had passed, and attentively listen to the story 
<A NAME="24"></A>of Agis's purpose and design. Now Cleomenes had a generous and great soul; 
<A NAME="25"></A>he was as temperate and moderate in his pleasures as Agis, but not so scrupulous, 
<A NAME="26"></A>circumspect, and gentle. There was something of heat and passion always 
<A NAME="27"></A>goading him on, and an impetuosity and violence in his eagerness to pursue 
<A NAME="28"></A>anything which he thought good and just. To have men obey him of their 
<A NAME="29"></A>own free-will, he conceived to be the best discipline; but likewise, to 
<A NAME="30"></A>subdue resistance, and force them to the better course was, in his opinion, 
<A NAME="31"></A>commendable and brave.
<A NAME="32"></A><BR><BR>This disposition made him dislike the management of the city. The 
<A NAME="33"></A>citizens lay dissolved in supine idleness and pleasures, the king let everything 
<A NAME="34"></A>take its own way, thankful if nobody gave him any disturbance, nor called 
<A NAME="35"></A>him away from the enjoyment of his wealth and luxury. The public interest 
<A NAME="36"></A>was neglected, and each man intent upon his private gain. It was dangerous, 
<A NAME="37"></A>now Agis was killed, so much as to name such a thing as the exercising 
<A NAME="38"></A>and training of their youth: and to speak of the ancient temperance, endurance, 
<A NAME="39"></A>and equality, was a sort of treason against the state. It is said also 
<A NAME="40"></A>that Cleomenes, whilst a boy, studied philosophy under Sphaerus, the Borystenite, 
<A NAME="41"></A>who crossed over to Sparta, and spent some time and trouble in instructing 
<A NAME="42"></A>the youth. Sphaerus was one of the first of Zeno the Citiean's scholars, 
<A NAME="43"></A>and it is likely enough that he admired the manly temper of Cleomenes and 
<A NAME="44"></A>inflamed his generous ambition. The ancient Leonidas, as story tells, being 
<A NAME="45"></A>asked what manner of poet he thought Tyrtaeus, replied, "Good to whet young 
<A NAME="46"></A>men's courage;" for being filled with a divine fury by his poems, they 
<A NAME="47"></A>rushed into any danger. And so the Stoic philosophy is a dangerous incentive 
<A NAME="48"></A>to strong and fiery dispositions, but where it combines with a grave and 
<A NAME="49"></A>gentle temper, is most successful in leading it to its proper 
<A NAME="50"></A>good.
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR>Upon the death of his father Leonidas, he succeeded, and observing 
<A NAME="52"></A>the citizens of all sorts to be debauched, the rich neglecting the public 
<A NAME="53"></A>good, and intent on their private gain and pleasure, and the poor distressed 
<A NAME="54"></A>in their own homes, and therefore without either spirit for war or ambition 
<A NAME="55"></A>to be trained up as Spartans, that he had only the name of king, and the 
<A NAME="56"></A>ephors all the power, he was resolved to change the posture of affairs. 
<A NAME="57"></A>He had a friend whose name was Xenares, his lover (such an affection the 
<A NAME="58"></A>Spartans express by the term, being inspired, or imbreathed with); him 
<A NAME="59"></A>he sounded, and of him he would commonly inquire what manner of king Agis 
<A NAME="60"></A>was, by what means and by what assistance he began and pursued his designs. 
<A NAME="61"></A>Xenares, at first, willingly complied with his request, and told him the 
<A NAME="62"></A>whole story, with all the particular circumstances of the actions. But 
<A NAME="63"></A>when he observed Cleomenes to be extremely affected at the relation, and 
<A NAME="64"></A>more than ordinarily taken with Agis's new model of the government, and 
<A NAME="65"></A>begging a repetition of the story, he at first severely chid him, told 
<A NAME="66"></A>him he was frantic, and at last left off all sort of familiarity and intercourse, 
<A NAME="67"></A>yet he never told any man the cause of their disagreement, but would only 
<A NAME="68"></A>say, Cleomenes knew very well. Cleomenes, finding Xenares averse to his 
<A NAME="69"></A>designs, and thinking all others to be of the same disposition, consulted 
<A NAME="70"></A>with none, but contrived the whole business by himself. And considering 
<A NAME="71"></A>that it would be easier to bring about an alteration when the city was 
<A NAME="72"></A>at war than when in peace, he engaged the commonwealth in a quarrel with 
<A NAME="73"></A>the Achaeans, who had given them fair occasions to complain. For Aratus, 
<A NAME="74"></A>a man of the greatest power amongst all the Achaeans, designed from the 
<A NAME="75"></A>very beginning to bring all the Peloponnesians into one common body. And 
<A NAME="76"></A>to effect this was the one object of all his many commanderships and his 
<A NAME="77"></A>long political course; as he thought this the only means to make them a 
<A NAME="78"></A>match for their foreign enemies. Pretty nearly all the rest agreed to his 
<A NAME="79"></A>proposals, only the Lacedaemonians, the Eleans, and as many of the Arcadians 
<A NAME="80"></A>as inclined to the Spartan interest, remained unpersuaded. And so as soon 
<A NAME="81"></A>as Leonidas was dead, he began to attack the Arcadians, and wasted those 
<A NAME="82"></A>especially that bordered on Achaea; by this means designing to try the 
<A NAME="83"></A>inclinations of the Spartans, and despising Cleomenes as a youth, and of 
<A NAME="84"></A>no experience in affairs of state or war. Upon this, the ephors sent Cleomenes 
<A NAME="85"></A>to surprise the Athenaeum, near Belbina, which is a pass commanding an 
<A NAME="86"></A>entrance into Laconia, and was then the subject of litigation with the 
<A NAME="87"></A>Megalopolitans. Cleomenes possessed himself of the place, and fortified 
<A NAME="88"></A>it, at which action Aratus showed no public resentment, but marched by 
<A NAME="89"></A>night to surprise Tegea and Orchomenus. The design failed, for those that 
<A NAME="90"></A>were to betray the cities into his hands turned afraid; so Aratus retreated, 
<A NAME="91"></A>imagining that his design had been undiscovered. But Cleomenes wrote a 
<A NAME="92"></A>sarcastic letter to him, and desired to know as from a friend, whither 
<A NAME="93"></A>he intended to march at night; and Aratus answering, that having heard 
<A NAME="94"></A>of his design to fortify Belbina, he meant to march thither to oppose him, 
<A NAME="95"></A>Cleomenes rejoined that he did not dispute it, but begged to be informed, 
<A NAME="96"></A>if he might be allowed to ask the question, why he carried those torches 
<A NAME="97"></A>and ladders with him.
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR>Aratus laughing at the jest, and asking what manner of youth this 
<A NAME="99"></A>was, Damocrates, a Spartan exile, replied, "If you have any designs upon 
<A NAME="100"></A>the Lacedaemonians, begin before this young eagle's talons are grown." 
<A NAME="101"></A>Presently after this, Cleomenes, encamping in Arcadia with a few horse 
<A NAME="102"></A>and three hundred foot, received orders from the ephors, who feared to 
<A NAME="103"></A>engage in the war, commanding him to return home; but when upon his retreat 
<A NAME="104"></A>Aratus took Caphyae, they commissioned him again. In this expedition he 
<A NAME="105"></A>took Methydrium, and overran the country of the Argives; and the Achaeans, 
<A NAME="106"></A>to oppose him, came out with an army of twenty thousand foot and one thousand 
<A NAME="107"></A>horse, under the command of Aristomachus. Cleomenes faced them at Pallantium, 
<A NAME="108"></A>and offered battle, but Aratus, being cowed by his bravery, would not suffer 
<A NAME="109"></A>the general to engage, but retreated amidst the reproaches of the Achaeans 
<A NAME="110"></A>and the derision and scorn of the Spartans, who were not above five thousand. 
<A NAME="111"></A>Cleomenes, encouraged by this success, began to speak boldly among the 
<A NAME="112"></A>citizens, and reminding them of a sentence of one of their ancient kings, 
<A NAME="113"></A>said, it was in vain now that the Spartans asked not how many their enemies 
<A NAME="114"></A>were, but where they were. After this, marching to the assistance of the 
<A NAME="115"></A>Eleans, whom the Achaeans were attacking, falling upon the enemy in their 
<A NAME="116"></A>retreat near the Lycaeum, he put their whole army to flight, taking a great 
<A NAME="117"></A>number of captives, and leaving many dead upon the place; so that it was 
<A NAME="118"></A>commonly reported amongst the Greeks that Aratus was slain. But Aratus, 
<A NAME="119"></A>making the best advantage of the opportunity, immediately after the defeat 
<A NAME="120"></A>marched to Mantinea, and before anybody suspected it, took the city, and 
<A NAME="121"></A>put a garrison into it. Upon this, the Lacedaemonians being quite discouraged, 
<A NAME="122"></A>and opposing Cleomenes's designs of carrying on the war, he now exerted 
<A NAME="123"></A>himself to have Archidamus, the brother of Agis, sent for from Messene, 
<A NAME="124"></A>as he, of the other family, had a right to the kingdom; and besides, Cleomenes 
<A NAME="125"></A>thought that the power of the ephors would be reduced, when the kingly 
<A NAME="126"></A>state was thus filled up, and raised to its proper position. But those 
<A NAME="127"></A>that were concerned in the murder of Agis, perceiving the design, and fearing 
<A NAME="128"></A>that upon Archidamus's return that they should be called to an account, 
<A NAME="129"></A>received him on his coming privately into town, and joined in bringing 
<A NAME="130"></A>him home, and presently after murdered him. Whether Cleomenes was against 
<A NAME="131"></A>it, as Phylarchus thinks, or whether he was persuaded by his friends, or 
<A NAME="132"></A>let him fall into their hands, is uncertain; however, they were most blamed, 
<A NAME="133"></A>as having forced his consent.
<A NAME="134"></A><BR><BR>He, still resolving to new model the state, bribed the ephors to 
<A NAME="135"></A>send him out to war; and won the affections of many others by means of 
<A NAME="136"></A>his mother Cratesiclea, who spared no cost and was very zealous to promote 
<A NAME="137"></A>her son's ambition; and though of herself she had no inclination to marry, 
<A NAME="138"></A>yet for his sake she accepted, as her husband, one of the chiefest citizens 
<A NAME="139"></A>for wealth and power. Cleomenes, marching forth with the army now under 
<A NAME="140"></A>his command, took Leuctra, a place belonging to Megalopolis; and the Achaeans 
<A NAME="141"></A>quickly coming up to resist him with a good body of men commanded by Aratus, 
<A NAME="142"></A>in a battle under the very walls of the city, some part of his army was 
<A NAME="143"></A>routed. But whereas Aratus had commanded the Achaeans not to pass a deep 
<A NAME="144"></A>watercourse, and thus put a stop to the pursuit, Lydiadas, the Megalopolitan, 
<A NAME="145"></A>fretting at the orders, and encouraging the horse which he led, and following 
<A NAME="146"></A>the routed enemy, got into a place full of vines, hedges, and ditches; 
<A NAME="147"></A>and being forced to break his ranks, began to retire in disorder. Cleomenes, 
<A NAME="148"></A>observing the advantage, commanded the Tarentines and Cretans to engage 
<A NAME="149"></A>him, by whom, after a brave defence, he was routed and slain. The Lacedaemonians, 
<A NAME="150"></A>thus encouraged, fell with a great shout upon the Achaeans, and routed 
<A NAME="151"></A>their whole army. Of the slain, who were very many, the rest Cleomenes 
<A NAME="152"></A>delivered up, when the enemy petitioned for them; but the body of Lydiadas 
<A NAME="153"></A>he commanded to be brought to him; and then putting on it a purple robe, 
<A NAME="154"></A>and a crown upon its head, sent a convoy with it to the gates of Megalopolis. 
<A NAME="155"></A>This is that Lydiadas who resigned his power as tyrant, restored liberty 
<A NAME="156"></A>to the citizens, and joined the city to the Achaean 
<A NAME="157"></A>interest.
<A NAME="158"></A><BR><BR>Cleomenes, being very much elated by this success, and persuaded 
<A NAME="159"></A>that if matters were wholly at his disposal he should soon be too hard 
<A NAME="160"></A>for the Achaeans, persuaded Magistonus, his mother's husband, that it was 
<A NAME="161"></A>expedient for the state to shake off the power of the ephors, and to put 
<A NAME="162"></A>all their wealth into one common stock for the whole body; thus Sparta, 
<A NAME="163"></A>being restored to its old equality, might aspire again to the command of 
<A NAME="164"></A>all Greece. Megistonas liked the design, and engaged two or three more 
<A NAME="165"></A>of his friends. About that time, one of the ephors, sleeping in Pasiphaes 
<A NAME="166"></A>temple, dreamed a very surprising dream; for he thought he saw the four 
<A NAME="167"></A>chairs removed out of the place where the ephors used to sit and do the 
<A NAME="168"></A>business of their office, and one only set there; and whilst he wondered, 
<A NAME="169"></A>he heard a voice out of the temple, saying, "This is best for Sparta." 
<A NAME="170"></A>The person telling Cleomenes this dream, he was a little troubled at first, 
<A NAME="171"></A>fearing that he used this as a trick to sift him, upon some suspicion of 
<A NAME="172"></A>his design, but when he was satisfied that the relator spoke truth, he 
<A NAME="173"></A>took heart again. And carrying with him those whom he thought would be 
<A NAME="174"></A>most against his project, he took Heraea and Alsaea two towns in league 
<A NAME="175"></A>with the Achaeans, furnished Orchomenus with provisions, encamped before 
<A NAME="176"></A>Mantinea, and with long marches up and down so harassed the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="177"></A>that many of them at their own request were left behind in Arcadia, while 
<A NAME="178"></A>he with the mercenaries went on toward Sparta, and by the way communicated 
<A NAME="179"></A>his design to those whom he thought fitted for his purpose, and marched 
<A NAME="180"></A>slowly, that he might catch the ephors at supper.
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR>When he was come near the city, he sent Euryclidas to the public 
<A NAME="182"></A>table, where the ephors supped, under pretence of carrying some message 
<A NAME="183"></A>from him from the army; Therycion, Phoebis, and two of those who had been 
<A NAME="184"></A>bred up with Cleomenes, whom they call mothaces, followed with a few soldiers; 
<A NAME="185"></A>and whilst Euryclidas was delivering his message to the ephors, they ran 
<A NAME="186"></A>upon them with their drawn swords and slew them. The first of them, Agylaeus, 
<A NAME="187"></A>on receiving the blow, fell, and lay as dead; but in a little time quietly 
<A NAME="188"></A>raising himself, and drawing himself out of the room, he crept, without 
<A NAME="189"></A>being discovered, into a little building which was dedicated to Fear, and 
<A NAME="190"></A>which always used to be shut, but then by chance was open; and being got 
<A NAME="191"></A>in, he shut the door, and lay close. The other four were killed, and above 
<A NAME="192"></A>ten more that came to their assistance; to those that were quiet they did 
<A NAME="193"></A>no harm, stopped none that fled from the city and spared Agylaeus when 
<A NAME="194"></A>he came out of the temple the next day.
<A NAME="195"></A><BR><BR>The Lacedaemonians have not only sacred places dedicated to Fear, 
<A NAME="196"></A>but also to Death, Laughter, and the like Passions. Now they worship Fear, 
<A NAME="197"></A>not as they do supernatural powers which they dread, esteeming it hurtful, 
<A NAME="198"></A>but thinking their polity is chiefly kept up by fear. Therefore the ephors, 
<A NAME="199"></A>Aristotle is my author, when they entered upon their government, made proclamation 
<A NAME="200"></A>to the people, that they should shave their mustaches and be obedient to 
<A NAME="201"></A>the laws, that the laws might not be hard upon them, making, I suppose, 
<A NAME="202"></A>this trivial injunction to accustom their youth to obedience even in the 
<A NAME="203"></A>smallest matters. And the ancients, I think, did not imagine bravery to 
<A NAME="204"></A>be plain fearlessness, but a cautious fear of blame and disgrace. For those 
<A NAME="205"></A>that show most timidity towards the laws are most bold against their enemies; 
<A NAME="206"></A>and those are least afraid of any danger who are most afraid of a just 
<A NAME="207"></A>reproach. Therefore it was well said that-
<A NAME="208"></A><BR><BR>"A reverence still attends on fear;" and by 
<A NAME="209"></A>Homer,-
<A NAME="210"></A><BR><BR>"Feared you shall be, dear father, and revered;" and 
<A NAME="211"></A>again,-
<A NAME="212"></A><BR><BR>"In silence fearing those that bore the sway;" for the generality 
<A NAME="213"></A>of men are most ready to reverence those whom they fear. And, therefore, 
<A NAME="214"></A>the Lacedaemonians placed the temple of Fear by the Syssitium of the ephors, 
<A NAME="215"></A>having raised that magistracy to almost royal authority.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR><BR>The next day, Cleomenes proscribed eighty of the citizens whom 
<A NAME="217"></A>he thought necessary to banish, and removed all the seats of the ephors, 
<A NAME="218"></A>except one, in which he himself designed to sit and give audience; and 
<A NAME="219"></A>calling the citizens together he made an apology for his proceedings, saying, 
<A NAME="220"></A>that by Lycurgus, the counsel of Elders was joined to the kings, and that 
<A NAME="221"></A>that of government had continued a long time, and no other sort of magistrates 
<A NAME="222"></A>had been wanted. But afterwards, in the long war with the Messenians, when 
<A NAME="223"></A>the kings, having to command the army, found no time to administer justice, 
<A NAME="224"></A>they chose some of their friends, and left them to determine the suits 
<A NAME="225"></A>of the citizens in their stead. These were called ephors, and at first 
<A NAME="226"></A>behaved themselves as servants to the kings; but afterwards, by degrees, 
<A NAME="227"></A>they appropriated the power to themselves, and erected a distinct magistracy. 
<A NAME="228"></A>An evidence of the truth of this was the custom still observed by the kings, 
<A NAME="229"></A>who, when the ephors send for them, refuse, upon the first and the second 
<A NAME="230"></A>summons, to go, but upon the third rise up and attend them. And Asteropus, 
<A NAME="231"></A>the first that raised the ephors to that height of power, lived a great 
<A NAME="232"></A>many years after their institution. So long, therefore, he continued, as 
<A NAME="233"></A>they contained themselves within their own proper sphere, it had been better 
<A NAME="234"></A>to bear with them than to make a disturbance. But that an upstart introduced 
<A NAME="235"></A>power should so far subvert the ancient form of government as to banish 
<A NAME="236"></A>some kings, murder others, without hearing their defence, and threaten 
<A NAME="237"></A>those who desired to see the best and most divine constitution restored 
<A NAME="238"></A>in Sparta, was not to be borne. Therefore, if it had been possible for 
<A NAME="239"></A>him without bloodshed to free Lacedaemon from those foreign plagues, luxury, 
<A NAME="240"></A>sumptuosity, debts, and usury, and from those yet more ancient evils, poverty 
<A NAME="241"></A>and riches, he should have thought himself the happiest king in the world, 
<A NAME="242"></A>to have succeeded, like an expert physician, in curing the diseases of 
<A NAME="243"></A>his country without pain. But now, in this necessity, Lycurgus's example 
<A NAME="244"></A>favoured his proceedings, who being neither king nor magistrate, but a 
<A NAME="245"></A>private man, and aiming at the kingdom, came armed into the market-place, 
<A NAME="246"></A>so that King Charillus fled in alarm to the altar. He, being a good man, 
<A NAME="247"></A>and a lover of his country, readily concurred in Lycurgus's designs, and 
<A NAME="248"></A>admitted the revolution in the state. But, by his own actions, Lycurgus 
<A NAME="249"></A>had nevertheless borne witness that it was difficult to change the government 
<A NAME="250"></A>without force and fear, in the use of which he himself, he said, had been 
<A NAME="251"></A>so moderate as to do no more than put out of the way those who opposed 
<A NAME="252"></A>themselves to Sparta's happiness and safety. For the rest of the nation, 
<A NAME="253"></A>he told them, the whole land was now their common property; debtors should 
<A NAME="254"></A>be cleared of their debts, and examination made of those who were not citizens, 
<A NAME="255"></A>that the bravest men might thus be made free Spartans, and give aid in 
<A NAME="256"></A>arms to save the city, and "we," he said, "may no longer see Laconia, for 
<A NAME="257"></A>want of men to defend it, wasted by the Aetolians and 
<A NAME="258"></A>Illyrians."
<A NAME="259"></A><BR><BR>Then he himself first, with his step-father, Megistonas, and his 
<A NAME="260"></A>friends, gave up all their wealth into one public stock, and all the other 
<A NAME="261"></A>citizens followed the example. The land was divided, and every one that 
<A NAME="262"></A>he had banished had a share assigned him; for he promised to restore all 
<A NAME="263"></A>as soon as things were settled and in quiet. And completing the number 
<A NAME="264"></A>of citizens out of the best and most promising of the country people, he 
<A NAME="265"></A>raised a body of four thousand men; and instead of a spear, taught them 
<A NAME="266"></A>to use a sarissa, with both hands, and to carry their shields by a band, 
<A NAME="267"></A>and not by a handle, as before. After this he began to consult about the 
<A NAME="268"></A>education of the youth, and the Discipline, as they call it; most of the 
<A NAME="269"></A>particulars of which Sphaerus, being then at Sparta, assisted in arranging; 
<A NAME="270"></A>and in a short time the schools of exercise and the common tables recovered 
<A NAME="271"></A>their ancient decency and order, a few out of necessity, but the most voluntarily, 
<A NAME="272"></A>returning to that generous and Laconic way of living. And, that the name 
<A NAME="273"></A>of monarch might give them no jealousy, he made Euclidas, his brother, 
<A NAME="274"></A>partner in the throne; and that was the only time that Sparta had two kings 
<A NAME="275"></A>of the same family.
<A NAME="276"></A><BR><BR>Then, understanding that the Achaeans and Aratus imagined that 
<A NAME="277"></A>this change had disturbed and shaken his affairs, and that he would not 
<A NAME="278"></A>venture out of Sparta and leave the city now unsettled in the midst of 
<A NAME="279"></A>so great an alteration, he thought it great and serviceable to his designs 
<A NAME="280"></A>to show his enemies the zeal and forwardness of his troops. And, therefore, 
<A NAME="281"></A>making an incursion into the territories of Megalopolis, he wasted the 
<A NAME="282"></A>country far and wide, and collected considerable booty. And at last, taking 
<A NAME="283"></A>a company of actors as they were travelling from Messene, and building 
<A NAME="284"></A>a theatre in the enemy's country, and offering a prize of forty mince in 
<A NAME="285"></A>value, he sat spectator a whole day; not that he either desired or needed 
<A NAME="286"></A>such amusement, but wishing to show his disregard for his enemies, and 
<A NAME="287"></A>by a display of his contempt, to prove the extent of his superiority to 
<A NAME="288"></A>them. For his alone, of all the Greek or royal armies, had no stage-players, 
<A NAME="289"></A>no jugglers, no dancing or singing women attending it but was free from 
<A NAME="290"></A>all sorts of looseness, wantonness, and festivity, the young men being 
<A NAME="291"></A>for the most part at their exercises, and the old men giving them lessons, 
<A NAME="292"></A>or, at leisure times, diverting themselves with their native jests, and 
<A NAME="293"></A>quick Laconian answers; the good results of which we have noticed in the 
<A NAME="294"></A>life of Lycurgus.
<A NAME="295"></A><BR><BR>He himself instructed all by his example; he was a living pattern 
<A NAME="296"></A>of temperance before every man's eyes; and his course of living was neither 
<A NAME="297"></A>more stately, nor more expensive, nor in any way more pretentious, than 
<A NAME="298"></A>that of his people. And this was a considerable advantage to him in his 
<A NAME="299"></A>designs on Greece. For men when they waited upon other kings did not so 
<A NAME="300"></A>much admire their wealth, costly furniture, and numerous attendance, as 
<A NAME="301"></A>they hated their pride and state, their difficulty of access, and imperious 
<A NAME="302"></A>answers to their addresses. But when they came to Cleomenes, who was both 
<A NAME="303"></A>really a king and bore that title, and saw no purple, no robes of state 
<A NAME="304"></A>upon him, no couches and litters about him for his ease, and that he did 
<A NAME="305"></A>not receive requests and return answers after a long delay and difficulty, 
<A NAME="306"></A>through a number of messengers and door-keepers, or by memorials, but that 
<A NAME="307"></A>he rose and came forward in any dress he might happen to be wearing, to 
<A NAME="308"></A>meet those that came to wait upon him, stayed, talked freely and affably 
<A NAME="309"></A>with all that had business, they were extremely taken, and won to his service, 
<A NAME="310"></A>and professed that he alone was the true son of Hercules. His common every-day's 
<A NAME="311"></A>meal was in an ordinary room, very sparing, and after the Laconic manner; 
<A NAME="312"></A>and when he entertained ambassadors, or strangers, two more couches were 
<A NAME="313"></A>added, and a little better dinner provided by his servants, but no savouring 
<A NAME="314"></A>sauces or sweetmeats; only the dishes were larger, and the wine more plentiful. 
<A NAME="315"></A>For he reproved one of his friends for entertaining some strangers with 
<A NAME="316"></A>nothing but barley bread and black broth, such diet as they usually had 
<A NAME="317"></A>in their phiditia; saying that upon such occasions, and when they entertained 
<A NAME="318"></A>strangers, it was not well to be too exact Laconians. After the table was 
<A NAME="319"></A>removed, a stand was brought in with a brass vessel full of wine, two silver 
<A NAME="320"></A>bowls, which held about a pint apiece, a few silver cups, of which he that 
<A NAME="321"></A>pleased might drink, but wine was not urged on any of the guests. There 
<A NAME="322"></A>was no music, nor was any required; for he entertained the company himself, 
<A NAME="323"></A>sometimes asking questions, sometimes telling stories; and his conversation 
<A NAME="324"></A>was neither too grave or disagreeably serious, nor yet in any way rude 
<A NAME="325"></A>or ungraceful in its pleasantry. For he thought those ways of entrapping 
<A NAME="326"></A>men by gifts and presents, which other kings use, dishonest and artificial; 
<A NAME="327"></A>and it seemed to him to be the most noble method, and most suitable to 
<A NAME="328"></A>a king, to win the affections of those that came near him, by personal 
<A NAME="329"></A>intercourse and agreeable conversation, since between a friend and a mercenary 
<A NAME="330"></A>the only distinction is, that we gain the one by one's character and conversation, 
<A NAME="331"></A>the other by one's money.
<A NAME="332"></A><BR><BR>The Mantineans were the first that requested his aid; and when 
<A NAME="333"></A>he entered their city by night, they aided him to expel the Achaean garrison, 
<A NAME="334"></A>and put themselves under his protection. He restored them their polity 
<A NAME="335"></A>and laws, and the same day marched to Tegea; and a little while after, 
<A NAME="336"></A>fetching a compass through Arcadia, he made a descent upon Pherae, in Achaea, 
<A NAME="337"></A>intending to force Aratus to a battle, or bring him into disrepute for 
<A NAME="338"></A>refusing to engage, and suffer him to waste the country. Hyperbatas at 
<A NAME="339"></A>that time was general, but Aratus had all the power amongst the Achaeans, 
<A NAME="340"></A>marching forth with their whole strength, and encamping in Dymae, near 
<A NAME="341"></A>the Hecatombaeum, Cleomenes came up, and thinking it not advisable to pitch 
<A NAME="342"></A>between Dymae, a city of the enemies, and the camp of the Achaeans, he 
<A NAME="343"></A>boldly dared the Achaeans, and forced them to a battle, and routing their 
<A NAME="344"></A>phalanx, slew a great many in the fight, and took many prisoners, and thence 
<A NAME="345"></A>marching to Langon, and driving out the Achaean garrison, he restored the 
<A NAME="346"></A>city to the Eleans.
<A NAME="347"></A><BR><BR>The affair of the Achaeans being in this unfortunate condition, 
<A NAME="348"></A>Aratus, who was wont to take the office every other year, refused the command, 
<A NAME="349"></A>though they entreated and urged him to accept it. And this was ill-done, 
<A NAME="350"></A>when the storm was high, to put the power out of his own hands, and set 
<A NAME="351"></A>another to the helm. Cleomenes at first proposed fair and easy conditions 
<A NAME="352"></A>by his ambassadors to the Achaeans, but afterwards he sent others, and 
<A NAME="353"></A>required the chief command to be settled upon him; in other matters offering 
<A NAME="354"></A>to agree to reasonable terms, and to restore their captives and their country. 
<A NAME="355"></A>The Achaeans were willing to come to an agreement upon those terms, and 
<A NAME="356"></A>invited Cleomenes to Lerna, where an assembly was to be held; but it happened 
<A NAME="357"></A>that Cleomenes, hastily marching on, and drinking water at a wrong time, 
<A NAME="358"></A>brought up a quantity of blood and lost his voice; therefore being unable 
<A NAME="359"></A>to continue his journey, he sent the chiefest of the captives to the Achaeans, 
<A NAME="360"></A>and, putting off the meeting for some time, retired to 
<A NAME="361"></A>Lacedaemon.
<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR>This ruined the affairs of Greece, which was just beginning in 
<A NAME="363"></A>some sort to recover from its disasters, and to show some capability of 
<A NAME="364"></A>delivering itself from the insolence and rapacity of the Macedonians. For 
<A NAME="365"></A>Aratus (whether fearing or distrusting Cleomenes, or envying his unlooked-for 
<A NAME="366"></A>success, or thinking it a disgrace for him who had commanded thirty-three 
<A NAME="367"></A>years to have a young man succeed to all his glory and his power, and be 
<A NAME="368"></A>head of that government which he had been raising and settling so many 
<A NAME="369"></A>years), first endeavoured to keep the Achaeans from closing with Cleomenes; 
<A NAME="370"></A>but when they would not hearken to him, for Cleomenes' daring spirit, and 
<A NAME="371"></A>thinking the Lacedaemonians' proposals to be very reasonable, who designed 
<A NAME="372"></A>only to reduce Peloponnesus to its own model, upon this he took his last 
<A NAME="373"></A>refuge in an action which was unbecoming any of the Greeks, most dishonourable 
<A NAME="374"></A>to him, and most unworthy his former bravery and exploits. For he called 
<A NAME="375"></A>Antigonus into Greece and filled Peloponnesus with Macedonians, whom he 
<A NAME="376"></A>himself, when a youth, having beaten their garrison out of the castle of 
<A NAME="377"></A>Corinth, had driven from the same country. And there had been constant 
<A NAME="378"></A>suspicion and variance between him and all the kings, and of Antigonus, 
<A NAME="379"></A>in particular, he has said a thousand dishonourable things in the commentaries 
<A NAME="380"></A>he has left behind him. And though he declares himself how he suffered 
<A NAME="381"></A>considerable losses, and underwent great dangers, that he might free Athens 
<A NAME="382"></A>from the garrison of the Macedonians, yet, afterwards, he brought the very 
<A NAME="383"></A>same men armed into his own country, and his own house, even to the women's 
<A NAME="384"></A>apartment. He would not endure that one of the family of Hercules, and 
<A NAME="385"></A>king of Sparta, and one that reformed the polity of his country, as it 
<A NAME="386"></A>were, from a disordered harmony, and returned it to the plain Doric measure 
<A NAME="387"></A>and rule of life of Lycurgus, should be styled head of the Tritaeans and 
<A NAME="388"></A>Sicyonians; and whilst he fled the barley-cake and coarse coat, and, which 
<A NAME="389"></A>were his chief accusations against Cleomenes, the extirpation of wealth 
<A NAME="390"></A>and reformation of poverty, he basely subjected himself, together with 
<A NAME="391"></A>Achaea, to the diadem and purple, to the imperious commands of the Macedonians 
<A NAME="392"></A>and their satraps. That he might not seem to be under Cleomenes, he offered 
<A NAME="393"></A>sacrifices, called Antigonea, in honour of Antigonus, and sang paeans himself, 
<A NAME="394"></A>with a garland on his head, to the praise of a wasted, consumptive Macedonian. 
<A NAME="395"></A>I write this not out of any design to disgrace Aratus, for in many things 
<A NAME="396"></A>he showed himself a true lover of Greece, and a great man, but out of pity 
<A NAME="397"></A>to the weakness of human nature, which, in characters like this, so worthy 
<A NAME="398"></A>and in so many ways disposed to virtue, cannot maintain its honours unblemished 
<A NAME="399"></A>by some envious fault.
<A NAME="400"></A><BR><BR>The Achaeans meeting again in assembly at Argas, and Cleomenes 
<A NAME="401"></A>having come from Tegea, there were great hopes that all differences would 
<A NAME="402"></A>be composed. But Aratus, Antigonus and he having already agreed upon the 
<A NAME="403"></A>chief articles of their league, fearing that Cleomenes would carry all 
<A NAME="404"></A>before him, and either win or force the multitude to comply with his commands, 
<A NAME="405"></A>proposed that, having three hundred hostages put into his hands, he should 
<A NAME="406"></A>come alone into the town, or bring his army to the place of exercise, called 
<A NAME="407"></A>the Cyllarabium, outside the city, and treat there.
<A NAME="408"></A><BR><BR>Cleomenes, hearing this, said that he was unjustly dealt with; 
<A NAME="409"></A>for they ought to have told him so plainly at first, and not now he was 
<A NAME="410"></A>come even to their doors, show their jealousy and deny him admission. And 
<A NAME="411"></A>writing a letter to the Achaeans about the same subject, the greatest part 
<A NAME="412"></A>of which was an accusation of Aratus, while Aratus, on the other side, 
<A NAME="413"></A>spoke violently against him to the assembly, he hastily dislodged, and 
<A NAME="414"></A>sent a trumpeter to denounce war against the Achaeans, not to Argos, but 
<A NAME="415"></A>to Aegium, as Aratus writes, that he might not give them notice enough 
<A NAME="416"></A>to make provision for their defence. There had also been a movement among 
<A NAME="417"></A>the Achaeans themselves, and the cities were eager for revolt; the common 
<A NAME="418"></A>people expecting a division of the land, and a release from their debts, 
<A NAME="419"></A>and the chief men being in many places ill-disposed to Aratus, and some 
<A NAME="420"></A>of them angry and indignant with him for having brought the Macedonians 
<A NAME="421"></A>into Peloponnesus. Encouraged by these misunderstandings, Cleomenes invaded 
<A NAME="422"></A>Achaea, and first took Pellene by surprise, and beat out the Achaean garrison, 
<A NAME="423"></A>and afterwards brought over Pheneus and Pentelleum to his side. Now the 
<A NAME="424"></A>Achaeans, suspecting some treacherous designs at Corinth and Sicyon, sent 
<A NAME="425"></A>their horse and mercenaries out of Argos, to have an eye upon those cities, 
<A NAME="426"></A>and they themselves went to Argos to celebrate the Nemean games. Cleomenes, 
<A NAME="427"></A>advertised of this march, and hoping, as it afterwards fell out, that upon 
<A NAME="428"></A>an unexpected advance to the city, now busied in the solemnity of the games, 
<A NAME="429"></A>and thronged with numerous spectators, he should raise a considerable terror 
<A NAME="430"></A>and confusion amongst them by night, marched with his army to the walls, 
<A NAME="431"></A>and taking the quarter of the town called Aspis, which lies above the theatre, 
<A NAME="432"></A>well fortified, and hard to be approached, he so terrified them that none 
<A NAME="433"></A>offered to resist, but they agreed to accept a garrison, to give twenty 
<A NAME="434"></A>citizens for hostages, and to assist the Lacedaemonians, and that he should 
<A NAME="435"></A>have the chief command.
<A NAME="436"></A><BR><BR>This action considerably increased his reputation and his power; 
<A NAME="437"></A>for the ancient Spartan kings, though they in many ways endeavoured to 
<A NAME="438"></A>effect it, could never bring Argos to be permanently theirs. And Pyrrhus, 
<A NAME="439"></A>the most experienced captain, though he entered the city by force, could 
<A NAME="440"></A>not keep possession, but was slain himself, with a considerable part of 
<A NAME="441"></A>his army. Therefore they admired the despatch and contrivance of Cleomenes; 
<A NAME="442"></A>and those that before derided him, for imitating, as they said, Solon and 
<A NAME="443"></A>Lycurgus, in releasing the people from their debts, and in equalizing the 
<A NAME="444"></A>property of the citizens, were now fain to admit that this was the cause 
<A NAME="445"></A>of the change in the Spartans. For before they were very low in the world, 
<A NAME="446"></A>and so unable to secure their own, that the Aetolians, invading Laconia 
<A NAME="447"></A>brought away fifty thousand slaves; so that one of the elder Spartans is 
<A NAME="448"></A>reported to have said, that they had done Laconia a kindness by unburdening 
<A NAME="449"></A>it; and yet a little while after, by merely recurring once again to their 
<A NAME="450"></A>native customs, and re-entering the track of the ancient discipline, they 
<A NAME="451"></A>were able to give, as though it had been under the eyes and conduct of 
<A NAME="452"></A>Lycurgus himself, the most signal instances of courage and obedience, raising 
<A NAME="453"></A>Sparta to her ancient place as the commanding state of Greece, and recovering 
<A NAME="454"></A>all Peloponnesus.
<A NAME="455"></A><BR><BR>When Argos was captured, and Cleonae and Phlius came over, as they 
<A NAME="456"></A>did at once, to Cleomenes, Aratus was at Corinth, searching after some 
<A NAME="457"></A>who were reported to favour the Spartan interest. The news, being brought 
<A NAME="458"></A>to him, disturbed him very much; for he perceived the city inclining to 
<A NAME="459"></A>Cleomenes, and willing to be rid of the Achaeans. Therefore he summoned 
<A NAME="460"></A>the citizens to meet in the Council Hall, and slipping away without being 
<A NAME="461"></A>observed to the gate, he mounted his horse that had been brought for him 
<A NAME="462"></A>thither, and fled to Sicyon. And the Corinthians made such haste to Cleomenes 
<A NAME="463"></A>at Argos, that, as Aratus says, striving who should be first there, they 
<A NAME="464"></A>spoiled all their horses; he adds that Cleomenes was very angry with the 
<A NAME="465"></A>Corinthians for letting him escape; and that Megistonas came from Cleomenes 
<A NAME="466"></A>to him, desiring him to deliver up the castle at Corinth, which was then 
<A NAME="467"></A>garrisoned by the Achaeans, and offered him a considerable sum of money, 
<A NAME="468"></A>and that he answered that matters were not now in his power, but he in 
<A NAME="469"></A>theirs. Thus Aratus himself writes. But Cleomenes, marching from Argos, 
<A NAME="470"></A>and taking in the Troezenians, Epidaurians, and Hermioneans, came to Corinth, 
<A NAME="471"></A>and blocked up the castle, which the Achaeans would not surrender; and 
<A NAME="472"></A>sending for Aratus's friends and stewards, committed his house and estate 
<A NAME="473"></A>to their care and management; and sent Tritymallus, the Messenian, to him 
<A NAME="474"></A>a second time, desiring that the castle might be equally garrisoned by 
<A NAME="475"></A>the Spartans and Achaeans, and promising to Aratus himself double the pension 
<A NAME="476"></A>that he received from King Ptolemy. But Aratus, refusing the conditions, 
<A NAME="477"></A>and sending his own son with the other hostages to Antigonus, and persuading 
<A NAME="478"></A>the Achaeans to make a decree for delivering the castle into Antigonus's 
<A NAME="479"></A>hands, upon this Cleomenes invaded the territory of the Sicyonians, and 
<A NAME="480"></A>by a decree of the Corinthians, accepted Aratus's estate as a 
<A NAME="481"></A>gift.
<A NAME="482"></A><BR><BR>In the meantime Antigonus, with a great army, was passing Geranea; 
<A NAME="483"></A>and Cleomenes, thinking it more advisable to fortify and garrison, not 
<A NAME="484"></A>the isthmus, but the mountains called Onea, and by a war of posts and positions 
<A NAME="485"></A>to weary the Macedonians, rather than to venture a set battle with the 
<A NAME="486"></A>highly disciplined phalanx, put his design into execution, and very much 
<A NAME="487"></A>distressed Antigonus. For he had not brought victuals sufficient for his 
<A NAME="488"></A>army; nor was it easy to force a way through whilst Cleomenes guarded the 
<A NAME="489"></A>pass. He attempted by night to pass through Lechaeum, but failed and lost 
<A NAME="490"></A>some men; so that Cleomenes and his army were mightily encouraged, and 
<A NAME="491"></A>so flushed with the victory, that they went merrily to supper; and Antigonus 
<A NAME="492"></A>was very much dejected, being driven, by the necessity he was in, to most 
<A NAME="493"></A>unpromising attempts. He was proposing to march to the promontory of Heraeum, 
<A NAME="494"></A>and thence transport his army in boats to Sicyon, which would take up a 
<A NAME="495"></A>great deal of time, and require much preparation and means. But when it 
<A NAME="496"></A>was now evening, some of Aratus's friends came from Argos by sea, and invited 
<A NAME="497"></A>him to return, for the Argives would revolt from Cleomenes. Aristoteles 
<A NAME="498"></A>was the man that wrought the revolt, and he had no hard task to persuade 
<A NAME="499"></A>the common people; for they were all angry with Cleomenes for not releasing 
<A NAME="500"></A>them from their debts as they expected. Accordingly, obtaining fifteen 
<A NAME="501"></A>hundred of Antigonus's soldiers, Aratus sailed to Epidaurus; but Aristoteles, 
<A NAME="502"></A>not staying for his coming, drew out the citizens, and fought against the 
<A NAME="503"></A>garrison of the castle; and Timoxenus, with the Achaeans from Sicyon, came 
<A NAME="504"></A>to his assistance.
<A NAME="505"></A><BR><BR>Cleomenes heard the news about the second watch of the night, and 
<A NAME="506"></A>sending for Megistonas, angrily commanded him to go and set things right 
<A NAME="507"></A>at Argos. Megistonas had passed his word for the Argives' loyalty, and 
<A NAME="508"></A>had persuaded him not to banish the suspected. Therefore, despatching him 
<A NAME="509"></A>with two thousand soldiers, he himself kept watch upon Antigonus, and encouraged 
<A NAME="510"></A>the Corinthians, pretending that there was no great matter in the commotions 
<A NAME="511"></A>at Argos, but only a little disturbance raised by a few inconsiderable 
<A NAME="512"></A>persons. But when Megistonas, entering Argos, was slain, and the garrison 
<A NAME="513"></A>could scarce hold out, and frequent messengers came to Cleomenes for succours, 
<A NAME="514"></A>he fearing lest the enemy, having taken Argos, should shut up the passes 
<A NAME="515"></A>and securely waste Laconia, and besiege Sparta itself, which he had left 
<A NAME="516"></A>without forces, dislodged from Corinth, and immediately lost that city; 
<A NAME="517"></A>for Antigonus entered it and garrisoned the town. He turned aside from 
<A NAME="518"></A>his direct march, and assaulting the walls of Argos, endeavoured to carry 
<A NAME="519"></A>it by a sudden attack; and then, having collected his forces from their 
<A NAME="520"></A>march, breaking into the Aspis, he joined the garrison, which still held 
<A NAME="521"></A>out against the Achaeans; some parts of the city he scaled and took, and 
<A NAME="522"></A>his Cretan archers cleared the streets. But when he saw Antigonus with 
<A NAME="523"></A>his phalanx descending from the mountains into the plain, and the horse 
<A NAME="524"></A>on all sides entering the city, he thought it impossible to maintain his 
<A NAME="525"></A>post, and, gathering together all his men, came safely down and made his 
<A NAME="526"></A>retreat under the walls, having in so short a time possessed himself of 
<A NAME="527"></A>great power, and in one journey, so to say, having made himself master 
<A NAME="528"></A>of all Peloponnesus, and now lost all again in as short a time. For some 
<A NAME="529"></A>of his allies at once withdrew and forsook him, and others not long after 
<A NAME="530"></A>put their cities under Antigonus's protection. His hopes thus defeated, 
<A NAME="531"></A>as he was leading back the relics of his forces, messengers from Lacedaemon 
<A NAME="532"></A>met him in the evening at Tegea, and brought him news of as great a misfortune 
<A NAME="533"></A>as that which he had lately suffered, and this was the death of his wife, 
<A NAME="534"></A>to whom he was so attached and thought so much of her that even in his 
<A NAME="535"></A>most successful expeditions, when he was most prosperous, he could not 
<A NAME="536"></A>refrain, but would every now and then come home to Sparta, to visit 
<A NAME="537"></A>Agiatis.
<A NAME="538"></A><BR><BR>This news afflicted him extremely, and he grieved, as a young man 
<A NAME="539"></A>would do, for the loss of a very beautiful and excellent wife; yet he did 
<A NAME="540"></A>not let his passion disgrace him or impair the greatness of his mind, but 
<A NAME="541"></A>keeping his usual voice, his countenance, and his habit, he gave necessary 
<A NAME="542"></A>orders to his captains, and took the precautions required for the safety 
<A NAME="543"></A>of Tegea. Next morning he came to Sparta, and having at home, with his 
<A NAME="544"></A>mother and children, bewailed the loss, and finished his mourning, he at 
<A NAME="545"></A>once devoted himself to the public affairs of the state.
<A NAME="546"></A><BR><BR>Now Ptolemy, the king of Egypt, promised him assistance, but demanded 
<A NAME="547"></A>his mother and children for hostages. This, for some considerable time, 
<A NAME="548"></A>he was ashamed to discover to his mother; and though he often went to her 
<A NAME="549"></A>on purpose, and was just upon the discourse, yet he still refrained, and 
<A NAME="550"></A>kept it to himself; so that she began to suspect, and asked his friends, 
<A NAME="551"></A>whether Cleomenes had something to say to her, which he was afraid to speak. 
<A NAME="552"></A>At last, Cleomenes venturing to tell her, she laughed aloud, and said, 
<A NAME="553"></A>"Was this the thing that you had so often a mind to tell me, and were afraid? 
<A NAME="554"></A>Make haste and put me on ship-board, and send this carcass where it may 
<A NAME="555"></A>be most serviceable to Sparta, before age destroys it unprofitably here." 
<A NAME="556"></A>Therefore, all things being provided for the voyage, they went by land 
<A NAME="557"></A>to Taenarus, and the army waited on them. Cratesiclea, when she was ready 
<A NAME="558"></A>to go on board, took Cleomenes aside into Neptune's temple and embracing 
<A NAME="559"></A>him, who was much dejected and extremely discomposed, she said, "Go to, 
<A NAME="560"></A>King of Sparta; when we come forth at the door, let none see us weep, or 
<A NAME="561"></A>show any passion that is unworthy of Sparta, for that alone is in our own 
<A NAME="562"></A>power; as for success or disappointment, those wait on us as the deity 
<A NAME="563"></A>decrees." Having thus said and composed her countenance, she went to the 
<A NAME="564"></A>ship with her little grandson, and bade the pilot put at once out to sea. 
<A NAME="565"></A>When she came to Egypt, and understood that Ptolemy entertained proposals 
<A NAME="566"></A>and overtures of peace from Antigonus, and that Cleomenes, though the Achaeans 
<A NAME="567"></A>invited and urged him to an agreement, was afraid, for her sake, to come 
<A NAME="568"></A>to any, without Ptolemy's consent, she wrote to him, advising him to do 
<A NAME="569"></A>that which was most becoming and most profitable for Sparta, and not, for 
<A NAME="570"></A>the sake of an old woman and a little child, stand always in fear of Ptolemy. 
<A NAME="571"></A>This character she maintained in her misfortunes.
<A NAME="572"></A><BR><BR>Antigonus, having taken Tegea, and plundered Orchomenus and Mantinea, 
<A NAME="573"></A>Cleomenes was shut up within the narrow bounds of Laconia; and making such 
<A NAME="574"></A>of the helots as could pay five Attic pounds free of Sparta, and, by that 
<A NAME="575"></A>means, getting together five hundred talents, and arming two thousand after 
<A NAME="576"></A>the Macedonian fashion, that he might make a body fit to oppose Antigonus's 
<A NAME="577"></A>Leucaspides, he undertook a great and unexpected enterprise. Megalopolis 
<A NAME="578"></A>was at that time a city of itself as great and as powerful as Sparta, and 
<A NAME="579"></A>had the forces of the Achaeans and of Antigonus encamping beside it; and 
<A NAME="580"></A>it was chiefly the Megalopolitans' doing, that Antigonus had been called 
<A NAME="581"></A>in to assist the Achaeans. Cleomenes, resolving to snatch the city (no 
<A NAME="582"></A>other word so well suits so rapid and so surprising an action), ordered 
<A NAME="583"></A>his men to take five days' provision, and marched to Sellasia, as if he 
<A NAME="584"></A>intended to ravage the country of the Argives; but from thence making a 
<A NAME="585"></A>descent into the territories of Megalopolis, and refreshing his army about 
<A NAME="586"></A>Rhoeteum, he suddenly took the road by Helicus, and advanced directly upon 
<A NAME="587"></A>the city. When he was not far off the town, he sent Panteus, with two regiments, 
<A NAME="588"></A>to surprise a portion of the wall between two towers, which he learnt to 
<A NAME="589"></A>be the most unguarded quarter of the Megalopolitans' fortifications, and 
<A NAME="590"></A>with the rest of his forces he followed leisurely. Panteus not only succeeded 
<A NAME="591"></A>at that point, but finding a great part of the wall without guards, he 
<A NAME="592"></A>at once proceeded to pull it down in some places, and make openings through 
<A NAME="593"></A>it in others, and killed all the defenders that he found. Whilst he was 
<A NAME="594"></A>thus busied, Cleomenes came up to him, and was got with his army within 
<A NAME="595"></A>the city, before the Megalopolitans knew of the surprise. When, after some 
<A NAME="596"></A>time, they learned their misfortune, some left the town immediately, taking 
<A NAME="597"></A>with them what property they could; others armed and engaged the enemy; 
<A NAME="598"></A>and though they were not able to beat them out, yet they gave their citizens 
<A NAME="599"></A>time and opportunity safely to retire, so that there were not above one 
<A NAME="600"></A>thousand persons taken in the town, all the rest flying, with their wives 
<A NAME="601"></A>and children, and escaping to Messene. The greater number, also, of those 
<A NAME="602"></A>that armed and fought the enemy were saved, and very few taken, amongst 
<A NAME="603"></A>whom were Lysandridas and Thearidas, two men of great power and reputation 
<A NAME="604"></A>amongst the Megalopolitans; and therefore the soldiers, as soon as they 
<A NAME="605"></A>were taken, brought them to Cleomenes. And Lysandridas, as soon as he saw 
<A NAME="606"></A>Cleomenes afar off, cried out, "Now, King of Sparta, it is in your power, 
<A NAME="607"></A>by doing a most kingly and a nobler action than you have already performed, 
<A NAME="608"></A>to purchase the greatest glory." And Cleomenes, guessing at his meaning, 
<A NAME="609"></A>replied, "What, Lysandridas, you will not surely advise me to restore your 
<A NAME="610"></A>city to you again?" "It is that which I mean," Lysandridas replied; "and 
<A NAME="611"></A>I advise you not to ruin so brave a city, but to fill it with faithful 
<A NAME="612"></A>and steadfast friends and allies, by restoring their country to the Megalopolitans, 
<A NAME="613"></A>and being the saviour of so considerable a people." Cleomenes paused a 
<A NAME="614"></A>while, and then said: "It is very hard to trust so far in these matters; 
<A NAME="615"></A>but with us let profit always yield to glory." Having said this, he sent 
<A NAME="616"></A>the two men to Messene with a herald from himself, offering the Megalopolitans 
<A NAME="617"></A>their city again, if they would forsake the Achaean interest, and be on 
<A NAME="618"></A>his side. But though Cleomenes made these generous and humane proposals, 
<A NAME="619"></A>Philopoemen would not suffer them to break their league with the Achaeans; 
<A NAME="620"></A>and accusing Cleomenes to the people, as if his design was not to restore 
<A NAME="621"></A>the city, but to take the citizens too, he forced Thearidas and Lysandridas 
<A NAME="622"></A>to leave Messene.
<A NAME="623"></A><BR><BR>This was that Philopoemen who was afterwards chief of the Achaeans 
<A NAME="624"></A>and a man of the greatest reputation amongst the Greeks, as I have related 
<A NAME="625"></A>in his own life. This news coming to Cleomenes, though he had before taken 
<A NAME="626"></A>strict care that the city should not be plundered, yet then, being in anger, 
<A NAME="627"></A>and out of all patience, he despoiled the place of all the valuables, and 
<A NAME="628"></A>sent the statues and pictures to Sparta; and demolishing a great part of 
<A NAME="629"></A>the city, he marched away for fear of Antigonus and the Achaeans; but they 
<A NAME="630"></A>never stirred, for they were at Aegium, at a council of war. There Aratus 
<A NAME="631"></A>mounted the speaker's place, and wept a long while, holding his mantle 
<A NAME="632"></A>before his face; and at last, the company being amazed, and commanding 
<A NAME="633"></A>him to speak, he said, "Megalopolis is destroyed by Cleomenes." The assembly 
<A NAME="634"></A>instantly dissolved, the Achaeans being astounded at the suddenness and 
<A NAME="635"></A>greatness of the loss; and Antigonus, intending to send speedy succours, 
<A NAME="636"></A>when he found his forces gather very slowly out of their winter-quarters, 
<A NAME="637"></A>sent them orders to continue there still; and he himself marched to Argos 
<A NAME="638"></A>with a small body of men. And now the second enterprise of Cleomenes, though 
<A NAME="639"></A>it had the look of a desperate and frantic adventure, yet in Polybius's 
<A NAME="640"></A>opinion, was done with mature deliberation and great foresight. For knowing 
<A NAME="641"></A>very well that the Macedonians were dispersed into their winter-quarters, 
<A NAME="642"></A>and that Antigonus with his friends and a few mercenaries about him wintered 
<A NAME="643"></A>in Argos, upon these considerations he invaded the country of the Argives, 
<A NAME="644"></A>hoping to shame Antigonus to a battle upon unequal terms, or else if he 
<A NAME="645"></A>did not dare to fight, to bring him into disrepute with the Achaeans. And 
<A NAME="646"></A>this accordingly happened. For Cleomenes wasting, plundering, and spoiling 
<A NAME="647"></A>the whole country, the Argives, in grief and anger at the loss, gathered 
<A NAME="648"></A>in crowds at the king's gates, crying out that he should either fight, 
<A NAME="649"></A>or surrender his command to better and braver men. But Antigonus, as became 
<A NAME="650"></A>an experienced captain, accounting it rather dishonourable foolishly to 
<A NAME="651"></A>hazard his army and quit his security, than merely to be railed at by other 
<A NAME="652"></A>people, would not march out against Cleomenes, but stood firm to his convictions. 
<A NAME="653"></A>Cleomenes, in the meantime, brought his army up to the very walls, and 
<A NAME="654"></A>having without opposition spoiled the country, and insulted over his enemies, 
<A NAME="655"></A>drew off again.
<A NAME="656"></A><BR><BR>A little while after, being informed that Antigonus designed a 
<A NAME="657"></A>new advance to Tegea, and thence to invade Laconia, he rapidly took his 
<A NAME="658"></A>soldiers, and marching by a side-road, appeared early in the morning before 
<A NAME="659"></A>Argos, and wasted the fields about it. The corn he did not cut down, as 
<A NAME="660"></A>is usual, with reaping books and knives, but beat it down with great wooden 
<A NAME="661"></A>staves made like broadswords, as if, in mere contempt and wanton scorn, 
<A NAME="662"></A>while travelling on his way, without any effort or trouble, he spoiled 
<A NAME="663"></A>and destroyed their harvest. Yet when his soldiers would have set Cyllabaris, 
<A NAME="664"></A>the exercise ground, on fire, he stopped the attempt, as if he felt that 
<A NAME="665"></A>the mischief he had done at Megalopolis had been the effort of his passion 
<A NAME="666"></A>rather than his wisdom. And when Antigonus, first of all, came hastily 
<A NAME="667"></A>back to Argos, and then occupied the mountains and passes with his posts, 
<A NAME="668"></A>he professed to disregard and despise it all; and sent heralds to ask for 
<A NAME="669"></A>the keys of the temple of Juno, as though he proposed to offer sacrifice 
<A NAME="670"></A>there and then return. And with this scornful pleasantry upon Antigonus, 
<A NAME="671"></A>having sacrificed to the goddess under the walls of the temple, which was 
<A NAME="672"></A>shut, he went to Phlius; and from thence driving out those that garrisoned 
<A NAME="673"></A>Oligyrtus, he marched down to Orchomenus. And these enterprises not only 
<A NAME="674"></A>encouraged the citizens, but made him appear to the very enemies to be 
<A NAME="675"></A>a man worthy of high command, and capable of great things. For with the 
<A NAME="676"></A>strength of one city, not only to fight the power of the Macedonians and 
<A NAME="677"></A>all the Peloponnesians, supported by all the royal treasures, not only 
<A NAME="678"></A>to preserve Laconia from being spoiled, but to waste the enemy's country, 
<A NAME="679"></A>and to take so many and such considerable cities, was an argument of no 
<A NAME="680"></A>common skill and genius for command.
<A NAME="681"></A><BR><BR>But he that first said that money was the sinews of affairs, seems 
<A NAME="682"></A>especially in that saying to refer to war. Demades, when the Athenians 
<A NAME="683"></A>had voted that their galleys should be launched and equipped for action, 
<A NAME="684"></A>but could produce no money, told them, "The baker was wanted first, and 
<A NAME="685"></A>the pilot after." And the old Archidamus, in the beginning of the Peloponnesian 
<A NAME="686"></A>war, when the allies desired that the amount of their contributions should 
<A NAME="687"></A>be determined, is reported to have answered, that war cannot be fed upon 
<A NAME="688"></A>so much a day. For as wrestlers, who have thoroughly trained and, disciplined 
<A NAME="689"></A>their bodies, in time tire down and exhaust the most agile and most skilful 
<A NAME="690"></A>combatant, so Antigonus, coming to the war with great resources to spend 
<A NAME="691"></A>from, wore out Cleomenes, whose poverty made it difficult for him to provide 
<A NAME="692"></A>the merest sufficiency of pay for the mercenaries, or of provisions for 
<A NAME="693"></A>the citizens. For, in all other respects, time favoured Cleomenes; for 
<A NAME="694"></A>Antigonus's affair at home began to be disturbed. For the barbarians wasted 
<A NAME="695"></A>and overran Macedonia whilst he was absent, and at that particular time 
<A NAME="696"></A>a vast army of Illyrians had entered the country; to be freed from whose 
<A NAME="697"></A>devastations, the Macedonians sent for Antigonus, and the letters had almost 
<A NAME="698"></A>been brought to him before the battle was fought upon the receipt of which 
<A NAME="699"></A>he would at once have marched away home and left the Achaeans to look to 
<A NAME="700"></A>themselves. But Fortune, that loves to determine the greatest affairs by 
<A NAME="701"></A>a minute, in this conjuncture showed such an exact niceness of time, that 
<A NAME="702"></A>immediately after the battle in Sellasia was over, and Cleomenes had lost 
<A NAME="703"></A>his army and his city, the messengers came up and called for Antigonus. 
<A NAME="704"></A>And this above everything made Cleomenes's misfortune to be pitied; for 
<A NAME="705"></A>if he had gone on retreating and had forborne fighting two days longer, 
<A NAME="706"></A>there had been no need of hazarding a battle; since upon the departure 
<A NAME="707"></A>of the Macedonians, he might have had what conditions he pleased from the 
<A NAME="708"></A>Achaeans. But now, as was said before, for want of money, being necessitated 
<A NAME="709"></A>to trust everything to arms, he was forced with twenty thousand (such is 
<A NAME="710"></A>Polybius's account), to engage thirty thousand. And approving himself an 
<A NAME="711"></A>admirable commander in this difficulty, his citizens showing an extraordinary 
<A NAME="712"></A>courage, and his mercenaries bravery enough, he was overborne by the different 
<A NAME="713"></A>way of fighting, and the weight of the heavy-armed phalanx. Phylarchus 
<A NAME="714"></A>also affirms that the treachery of some about him was the chief cause of 
<A NAME="715"></A>Cleomenes's ruin.
<A NAME="716"></A><BR><BR>For Antigonus gave orders that the Illyrians and Acarnanians should 
<A NAME="717"></A>march round by a secret way, and encompass the other wing, which Euclidas, 
<A NAME="718"></A>Cleomenes's brother, commanded; and then drew out the rest of his forces 
<A NAME="719"></A>to the battle. And Cleomenes, from a convenient rising, viewing his order, 
<A NAME="720"></A>and not seeing any of the Illyrians and Acarnanians, began to suspect that 
<A NAME="721"></A>Antigonus had sent them upon some such design; and calling for Damoteles, 
<A NAME="722"></A>who was at the head of those specially appointed to such ambush duty, he 
<A NAME="723"></A>bade him carefully to look after and discover the enemy's designs upon 
<A NAME="724"></A>his rear. But Damoteles, for some say Antigonus had bribed him, telling 
<A NAME="725"></A>him that he should not be solicitous about that matter, for all was well 
<A NAME="726"></A>enough, but mind and fight those that met him in the front, he was satisfied, 
<A NAME="727"></A>and advanced against Antigonus; and by the vigorous charge of his Spartans, 
<A NAME="728"></A>made the Macedonian phalanx give ground, and pressed upon them with great 
<A NAME="729"></A>advantage about half a mile; but then making a stand, and seeing the danger 
<A NAME="730"></A>which the surrounding wing, commanded by his brother Euclidas, was in, 
<A NAME="731"></A>he cried out, "Thou art lost, dear brother, thou art lost, thou brave example 
<A NAME="732"></A>to our Spartan youth and theme of our matron's songs." And Euclidas's wing 
<A NAME="733"></A>being cut in pieces, and the conquerors from that part falling upon him, 
<A NAME="734"></A>he perceived his soldiers to be disordered, and unable to maintain the 
<A NAME="735"></A>fight, and therefore provided for his own safety. There fell, we are told, 
<A NAME="736"></A>in the battle, besides many of the mercenary soldiers, all the Spartans, 
<A NAME="737"></A>six thousand in number, except two hundred.
<A NAME="738"></A><BR><BR>When Cleomenes came into the city, he advised those citizens that 
<A NAME="739"></A>he met to receive Antigonus; and as for himself, he said, which should 
<A NAME="740"></A>appear most advantageous to Sparta, whether his life or death, that he 
<A NAME="741"></A>would choose. Seeing the women running out to those that had fled with 
<A NAME="742"></A>him, taking their arms, and bringing drink to them, he entered into his 
<A NAME="743"></A>own house, and his servant, who was a freeborn woman, taken from Megalopolis 
<A NAME="744"></A>after his wife's death, offering, as usual, to do the service he needed 
<A NAME="745"></A>on returning from war, though he was very thirsty, he refused to drink, 
<A NAME="746"></A>and though very weary to sit down; but in his corselet as he was, he laid 
<A NAME="747"></A>his arm sideway against a pillar, and leaning his forehead upon his elbow, 
<A NAME="748"></A>he rested his body a little while, and ran over in his thoughts all the 
<A NAME="749"></A>courses he could take; and then with his friends set out at once for Gythium; 
<A NAME="750"></A>where, finding ships which had been got ready for this very purpose, they 
<A NAME="751"></A>embarked. Antigonus, taking the city, treated the Lacedaemonians courteously, 
<A NAME="752"></A>and in no way off any insult or offence to the dignity of Sparta, but permitting 
<A NAME="753"></A>them to enjoy their own laws and polity, and sacrificing to the gods, dislodged 
<A NAME="754"></A>the third day. For he heard that there was a great war in Macedonia, and 
<A NAME="755"></A>that the country was devastated by the barbarians. Besides, his malady 
<A NAME="756"></A>had now thoroughly settled into a consumption and continual catarrh. Yet 
<A NAME="757"></A>he still kept up, and managed to return and deliver his country, and meet 
<A NAME="758"></A>there a most glorious death, in a great defeat and vast slaughter of the 
<A NAME="759"></A>barbarians. As Phylarchus says, and as is probable in itself, he broke 
<A NAME="760"></A>a blood-vessel by shouting in the battle itself. In the schools we used 
<A NAME="761"></A>to be told that, after the victory was won, he cried out for joy, "O glorious 
<A NAME="762"></A>day!" and presently bringing up a quantity of blood, fell into a fever, 
<A NAME="763"></A>which never left him till his death. And thus much concerning 
<A NAME="764"></A>Antigonus.
<A NAME="765"></A><BR><BR>Cleomenes, sailing from Cythera, touched at another island called, 
<A NAME="766"></A>Aegialia, whence as he was about to depart for Cyrene, one of his friends, 
<A NAME="767"></A>Therycion by name, a man of a noble spirit in all enterprises, and bold 
<A NAME="768"></A>and lofty in his talk, came privately to him, and said thus: "Sir, death 
<A NAME="769"></A>in battle, which is the most glorious, we have let go; though all heard 
<A NAME="770"></A>us say that Antigonus should never tread over the King of Sparta, unless 
<A NAME="771"></A>dead. And now that course which is next in honour and virtue is presented 
<A NAME="772"></A>to us. Whither do we madly sail, flying the evil which is near, to seek 
<A NAME="773"></A>that which is at a distance? For if it is not dishonourable for the race 
<A NAME="774"></A>of Hercules to serve the successors of Philip and Alexander, we shall save 
<A NAME="775"></A>a long voyage by delivering ourselves up to Antigonus, who, probably, is 
<A NAME="776"></A>as much better than Ptolemy, as the Macedonians are better than the Egyptians; 
<A NAME="777"></A>but if we think it mean to submit to those whose arms have conquered us, 
<A NAME="778"></A>why should we choose him for our master, by whom we have not yet been beaten? 
<A NAME="779"></A>Is it to acknowledge two superiors instead of one, whilst we run away from 
<A NAME="780"></A>Antigonus, and flatter Ptolemy? Or, is it for your mother's sake that you 
<A NAME="781"></A>retreat to Egypt? It will indeed be a very fine and very desirable sight 
<A NAME="782"></A>for her to show her son to Ptolemy's women, now changed from a prince into 
<A NAME="783"></A>an exile and a slave. Are we not still masters of our own swords? And whilst 
<A NAME="784"></A>we have Laconia in view, shall we not here free ourselves from this disgraceful 
<A NAME="785"></A>misery, and clear ourselves to those who at Sellasia died for the honour 
<A NAME="786"></A>and defence of Sparta? Or, shall we sit lazily in Egypt, inquiring what 
<A NAME="787"></A>news from Sparta, and whom Antigonus hath been pleased to make governor 
<A NAME="788"></A>of Lacedaemon?" Thus spoke Therycion; and this was Cleomenes's reply: "By 
<A NAME="789"></A>seeking death, you coward, the most easy and most ready refuge, you fancy 
<A NAME="790"></A>that you shall appear courageous and brave, though this flight is baser 
<A NAME="791"></A>than the former. Better men than we have given way to their enemies, having 
<A NAME="792"></A>been betrayed by fortune, or oppressed by multitude; but he that gives 
<A NAME="793"></A>way under labour or distresses, under the ill-opinions or reports of men, 
<A NAME="794"></A>yields the victory to his own effeminacy. For a voluntary death ought not 
<A NAME="795"></A>to be chosen as a relief from action but as an exemplary action itself; 
<A NAME="796"></A>and it is base either to live or to die only to ourselves. That death to 
<A NAME="797"></A>which you now invite us, is proposed only as a release from our present 
<A NAME="798"></A>miseries, but carries nothing of nobleness or profit in it. And I think 
<A NAME="799"></A>it becomes both me and you not to despair of our country; but when there 
<A NAME="800"></A>are no hopes of that left, those that have an inclination may quickly die." 
<A NAME="801"></A>To this Therycion returned no answer; but as soon as he had an opportunity 
<A NAME="802"></A>of leaving Cleomenes's company, went aside on the seashore, and ran himself 
<A NAME="803"></A>through.
<A NAME="804"></A><BR><BR>But Cleomenes sailed from Aegialia, landed in Libya, and, being 
<A NAME="805"></A>honourably conducted through the king's country, came to Alexandria. When 
<A NAME="806"></A>he was first brought to Ptolemy, no more than common civilities and usual 
<A NAME="807"></A>attentions were paid him; but when, upon trial, he found him a man of deep 
<A NAME="808"></A>sense and great reason, and that his plain Laconic way of conversation 
<A NAME="809"></A>carried with it a noble and becoming grace, that he did nothing unbecoming 
<A NAME="810"></A>his birth, nor bent under fortune, and was evidently a more faithful counsellor 
<A NAME="811"></A>than those who made it their business to please and flatter, he was ashamed, 
<A NAME="812"></A>and repented that be had neglected so great a man, and suffered Antigonus 
<A NAME="813"></A>to get so much power and reputation by ruining him. He now offered him 
<A NAME="814"></A>many marks of respect and kindness, and gave him hopes that he would furnish 
<A NAME="815"></A>him with ships and money to return to Greece, and would reinstate him in 
<A NAME="816"></A>his kingdom. He granted him a yearly pension of four-and-twenty talents; 
<A NAME="817"></A>a little part of which sum supplied his and his friends' thrifty temperance; 
<A NAME="818"></A>and the rest was employed in doing good offices to, and in relieving the 
<A NAME="819"></A>necessities of, the refugees that had fled from Greece, and retired into 
<A NAME="820"></A>Egypt.
<A NAME="821"></A><BR><BR>But the elder Ptolemy dying before Cleomenes's affairs had received 
<A NAME="822"></A>a full dispatch, and the successor being a loose, voluptuous, and effeminate 
<A NAME="823"></A>prince, under the power of his pleasures and his women, his business was 
<A NAME="824"></A>neglected. For the king was so besotted with his women and his wine, that 
<A NAME="825"></A>the employments of his most busy and serious hours consisted at the utmost 
<A NAME="826"></A>in celebrating religious feasts in his palace, carrying a timbrel, and 
<A NAME="827"></A>taking part in the show; while the greatest affairs of state were managed 
<A NAME="828"></A>by Agathoclea, the king's mistress, her mother, and the pimp Oenanthes. 
<A NAME="829"></A>At the first, indeed, they seemed to stand in need of Cleomenes; for Ptolemy, 
<A NAME="830"></A>being afraid of his brother Magas, who by his mother's means had a great 
<A NAME="831"></A>interest among the soldiers, gave Cleomenes a place in his secret councils, 
<A NAME="832"></A>and acquainted him with the design of taking off his brother. He, though 
<A NAME="833"></A>all were for it, declared his opinion to the contrary, saying. "The king, 
<A NAME="834"></A>if it were possible, should have more brothers for the better security 
<A NAME="835"></A>and stability of his affairs." And Sosibius, the greatest favourite, replying 
<A NAME="836"></A>that they were not secure of the mercenaries whilst Magas was alive, Cleomenes 
<A NAME="837"></A>returned, that he need not trouble himself about that matter; for amongst 
<A NAME="838"></A>the mercenaries there were above three thousand Peloponnesians, who were 
<A NAME="839"></A>his fast friends, and whom he could command at any time with a nod. This 
<A NAME="840"></A>discourse made Cleomenes for the present to be looked upon as a man of 
<A NAME="841"></A>great influence and assured fidelity; but afterwards, Ptolemy's weakness 
<A NAME="842"></A>increasing his fear, and he, as it usually happens, where there is no judgment 
<A NAME="843"></A>and wisdom, placing his security in general distrust and suspicion, it 
<A NAME="844"></A>rendered Cleomenes suspected to the courtiers, as having too much interest 
<A NAME="845"></A>with the mercenaries; and many had this saying in their mouths, that he 
<A NAME="846"></A>was a lion amidst a flock of sheep. For, in fact, such he seemed to be 
<A NAME="847"></A>in the court, quietly watching and keeping his eye upon all that went 
<A NAME="848"></A>on.
<A NAME="849"></A><BR><BR>He therefore gave up all thought of asking for ships and soldiers 
<A NAME="850"></A>from the king. But receiving news that Antigonus was dead, that the Achaeans 
<A NAME="851"></A>were engaged in a war with the Aetolians, and that the affairs of Peloponnesus, 
<A NAME="852"></A>being now in very great distraction and disorder, required and invited 
<A NAME="853"></A>his assistance, he desired leave to depart only with his friends, but could 
<A NAME="854"></A>not obtain that, the king not so much as hearing his petition, being shut 
<A NAME="855"></A>up amongst his women, and wasting his hours in bacchanalian rites and drinking 
<A NAME="856"></A>parties. But Sosibius, the chief minister and counsellor of state, thought 
<A NAME="857"></A>that Cleomenes, being detained against his will, would grow ungovernable 
<A NAME="858"></A>and dangerous, and yet that it was not safe to let him go, being an aspiring, 
<A NAME="859"></A>daring man, and well acquainted with the diseases and weakness of the kingdom. 
<A NAME="860"></A>For neither could presents and gifts conciliate or content him; but even 
<A NAME="861"></A>as Apis, while living in all possible plenty and apparent delight, yet 
<A NAME="862"></A>desires to live as nature would provide for him, to range at liberty, and 
<A NAME="863"></A>bound about the fields, and can scarce endure to be under the priests' 
<A NAME="864"></A>keeping, so he could not brook their courtship and soft entertainment, 
<A NAME="865"></A>but sat like Achilles-
<A NAME="866"></A><BR><BR>"and languished far,
<A NAME="867"></A><BR>Desiring battle and the shout of war."
<A NAME="868"></A><BR><BR>His affairs standing in this condition, Nicagoras, the Messenian, 
<A NAME="869"></A>came to Alexandria, a man that deeply hated Cleomenes, yet pretended to 
<A NAME="870"></A>be his friend; for he had formerly sold Cleomenes a fair estate, but never 
<A NAME="871"></A>received the money because Cleomenes was either unable as it may be, or 
<A NAME="872"></A>else, by reason of his engagement in the wars and other distractions, had 
<A NAME="873"></A>no opportunity to pay him. Cleomenes, seeing him landing, for he was then 
<A NAME="874"></A>walking upon the quay, kindly saluted him, and asked what business brought 
<A NAME="875"></A>him to Egypt. Nicagoras returned his compliment, and told him that he came 
<A NAME="876"></A>to bring some excellent war-horses to the king. And Cleomenes, with a smile, 
<A NAME="877"></A>subjoined, "I could wish you had rather brought young boys and music-girls; 
<A NAME="878"></A>for those now are the king's chief occupation." Nicagoras at the moment 
<A NAME="879"></A>smiled at the conceit, but a few days after, he put Cleomenes in mind of 
<A NAME="880"></A>the estate that he had bought of him, and desired his money, protesting 
<A NAME="881"></A>that he would not have troubled him, if his merchandise had turned out 
<A NAME="882"></A>as profitable as he had thought it would. Cleomenes replied, that he had 
<A NAME="883"></A>nothing left of all that had been given him. At which answer, Nicagoras, 
<A NAME="884"></A>being nettled, told Sosibius Cleomenes's scoff upon the king. He was delighted 
<A NAME="885"></A>to receive the information; but desiring to have some greater reason to 
<A NAME="886"></A>excite the king against Cleomenes, persuaded Nicagoras to leave a letter 
<A NAME="887"></A>written against Cleomenes, importing that he had a design, if he could 
<A NAME="888"></A>have gotten ships and soldiers, to surprise Cyrene. Nicagoras wrote such 
<A NAME="889"></A>a letter, and left Egypt. Four days after, Sosibius brought the letter 
<A NAME="890"></A>to Ptolemy, pretending it was just then delivered him, and excited the 
<A NAME="891"></A>young man's fear and anger; upon which it was agreed that Cleomenes should 
<A NAME="892"></A>be invited into a large house, and treated as formerly, but not suffered 
<A NAME="893"></A>to go out again.
<A NAME="894"></A><BR><BR>This usage was grievous to Cleomenes, and another incident that 
<A NAME="895"></A>occurred made him feel his hopes to be yet more entirely overcast. Ptolemy, 
<A NAME="896"></A>the son of Chrysermas, a favourite of the king's, had always shown civility 
<A NAME="897"></A>to Cleomenes; there was a considerable intimacy between them, and they 
<A NAME="898"></A>had been used to talk freely together about the state. He, upon Cleomenes's 
<A NAME="899"></A>desire, came to him, and spoke to him in fair terms, softening down his 
<A NAME="900"></A>suspicions and excusing the king's conduct. But as he went out again, not 
<A NAME="901"></A>knowing that Cleomenes followed him to the door, he severely reprimanded 
<A NAME="902"></A>the keepers for their carelessness in looking after "so great and so furious 
<A NAME="903"></A>a wild beast." This Cleomenes himself heard, and retiring before Ptolemy 
<A NAME="904"></A>perceived it, told his friends what had been said. Upon this they cast 
<A NAME="905"></A>off all former hopes and determined for violent proceedings, resolving 
<A NAME="906"></A>to be revenged on Ptolemy for his base and unjust dealing, to have satisfaction 
<A NAME="907"></A>for the affronts, to die as it became Spartans, and not stay till, like 
<A NAME="908"></A>fatted sacrifices, they were butchered. For it was both grievous and dishonourable 
<A NAME="909"></A>for Cleomenes, who had scorned to come to terms with Antigonus, a brave 
<A NAME="910"></A>warrior, and a man of action, to wait an effeminate king's leisure, till 
<A NAME="911"></A>he should lay aside his timbrel and end his dance, and then kill 
<A NAME="912"></A>him.
<A NAME="913"></A><BR><BR>These courses being resolved on, and Ptolemy happening at the same 
<A NAME="914"></A>time to make a progress to Canopus, they first spread abroad a report that 
<A NAME="915"></A>his freedom was ordered by the king, and, it being the custom for the king 
<A NAME="916"></A>to send presents and an entertainment to those whom he would free, Cleomenes's 
<A NAME="917"></A>friends made that provision, and sent it into the prison, thus imposing 
<A NAME="918"></A>upon the keepers, who thought it had been sent by the king. For he sacrificed, 
<A NAME="919"></A>and gave them large portions, and with a garland upon his head, feasted 
<A NAME="920"></A>and made merry with his friends. It is said that he began the action sooner 
<A NAME="921"></A>than he designed, having understood that a servant who was privy to the 
<A NAME="922"></A>plot had gone out to visit a mistress that he loved. This made him afraid 
<A NAME="923"></A>of a discovery; and therefore, as soon as it was full noon, and all the 
<A NAME="924"></A>keepers sleeping off their wine, he put on his coat, and opening his seam 
<A NAME="925"></A>to bare his right shoulder, with his drawn sword in his hand, he issued 
<A NAME="926"></A>forth, together with his friends provided in the same manner, making thirteen 
<A NAME="927"></A>in all. One of them, by name Hippitas, was lame, and followed the first 
<A NAME="928"></A>onset very well, but when he presently perceived that they were more slow 
<A NAME="929"></A>in their advances for his sake, he desired them to run him through and 
<A NAME="930"></A>not ruin their enterprise by staying for a useless, unprofitable man. By 
<A NAME="931"></A>chance an Alexandrian was then riding by the door; him they threw off, 
<A NAME="932"></A>and setting Hippitas on horseback, ran through the streets, and proclaimed 
<A NAME="933"></A>liberty to the people. But they, it seems, had courage enough to praise 
<A NAME="934"></A>and admire Cleomenes's daring, but not one had the heart to follow and 
<A NAME="935"></A>assist him. Three of them fell on Ptolemy, the son of Chrysermas, as he 
<A NAME="936"></A>was coming out of the palace, and killed him. Another Ptolemy, the officer 
<A NAME="937"></A>in charge of the city, advancing against them in a chariot, they set upon, 
<A NAME="938"></A>dispersed his guards and attendants, and pulling him out of the chariot, 
<A NAME="939"></A>killed him upon the place. Then they made toward the castle, designing 
<A NAME="940"></A>to break open the prison, release those who were confined, and avail themselves 
<A NAME="941"></A>of their numbers; but the keepers were too quick for them, and secured 
<A NAME="942"></A>the passages. Being baffled in this attempt, Cleomenes with his company 
<A NAME="943"></A>roamed about the city, none joining with him, but all retreating from and 
<A NAME="944"></A>flying his approach. Therefore, despairing of success, and saying to his 
<A NAME="945"></A>friends, that it was no wonder that women ruled over men that were afraid 
<A NAME="946"></A>of liberty, he bade them all die as bravely as became his followers and 
<A NAME="947"></A>their own past actions. This said, Hippitas was first, as he desired, run 
<A NAME="948"></A>through by one of the younger men, and then each of them readily and resolutely 
<A NAME="949"></A>fell upon his own sword, except Fanteus, the same who first surprised Megalopolis. 
<A NAME="950"></A>This man, being of a very handsome person, and a great lover of the Spartan 
<A NAME="951"></A>discipline, the king had made his dearest friend; and he now bade him, 
<A NAME="952"></A>when he had seen him and the rest fallen, die by their example. Fanteus 
<A NAME="953"></A>walked over them as they lay, and pricked every one with his dagger, to 
<A NAME="954"></A>try whether any was alive; when he pricked Cleomenes in the ankle, and 
<A NAME="955"></A>saw him turn upon his back, he kissed him, sat down by him, and when he 
<A NAME="956"></A>was quite dead, covered up the body, and then killed himself over 
<A NAME="957"></A>it.
<A NAME="958"></A><BR><BR>Thus fell Cleomenes, after the life which we have narrated, having 
<A NAME="959"></A>been King of Sparta sixteen years. The news of their fall being noised 
<A NAME="960"></A>through the city, Cratesiclea, though a woman of a great spirit, could 
<A NAME="961"></A>not bear up against the weight of this affliction; but embracing Cleomenes's 
<A NAME="962"></A>children broke out into lamentations. But the eldest boy, none suspecting 
<A NAME="963"></A>such a spirit in a child, threw himself headlong from the top of the house. 
<A NAME="964"></A>He was bruised very much, but not killed by the fall, and was taken up 
<A NAME="965"></A>crying, and expressing his resentment for not being permitted to destroy 
<A NAME="966"></A>himself. Ptolemy, as soon as an account of the action was brought him, 
<A NAME="967"></A>gave order that Cleomenes's body should be flayed and hung up, and that 
<A NAME="968"></A>his children, mother, and the women that were with her, should be killed. 
<A NAME="969"></A>Amongst these was Panteus's wife, a beautiful and noble-looking woman, 
<A NAME="970"></A>who had been but lately married, and suffered these disasters in the height 
<A NAME="971"></A>of her love. Her parents would not have her embark with Panteus so shortly 
<A NAME="972"></A>after they were married, though she eagerly desired it, but shut her up, 
<A NAME="973"></A>and kept her forcibly at home. But a few days after she procured a horse 
<A NAME="974"></A>and a little money, and escaping by night, made speed to Taenarus, where 
<A NAME="975"></A>she embarked for Egypt, came to her husband, and with him cheerfully endured 
<A NAME="976"></A>to live in a foreign country. She gave her hand to Cratesiclea, as she 
<A NAME="977"></A>was going with the soldiers to execution held up her robe, and begged her 
<A NAME="978"></A>to be courageous; who of herself was not in the least afraid of death, 
<A NAME="979"></A>and desired nothing else but only to be killed before the children. When 
<A NAME="980"></A>they were come to the place of execution, the children were first killed 
<A NAME="981"></A>before Cratesiclea's eyes, and afterwards she herself, with only these 
<A NAME="982"></A>words in her mouth, "O children, whither are you gone?" But Panteus's wife, 
<A NAME="983"></A>fastening her dress close about her, and being a strong woman, in silence 
<A NAME="984"></A>and perfect composure, looked after every one that was slain, and laid 
<A NAME="985"></A>them decently out as far as circumstances would permit; and after all were 
<A NAME="986"></A>killed, rearraying her dress, and drawing her clothes close about her, 
<A NAME="987"></A>suffering none to come near or be an eye-witness of her fall, besides the 
<A NAME="988"></A>executioner, she courageously submitted to the stroke, and wanted nobody 
<A NAME="989"></A>to look after her or wind her up after she was dead. Thus in her death 
<A NAME="990"></A>the modesty of her mind appeared, and set that guard upon her body which 
<A NAME="991"></A>she always kept when alive. And she, in the declining age of the Spartans, 
<A NAME="992"></A>showed that women were no unequal rivals of the men, and was an instance 
<A NAME="993"></A>of a courage superior to the affronts of fortune.
<A NAME="994"></A><BR><BR>A few days after, those that watched the hanging body of Cleomenes, 
<A NAME="995"></A>saw a large snake winding about his head, and covering his face, so that 
<A NAME="996"></A>no bird of prey would fly at it. This made the king superstitiously afraid, 
<A NAME="997"></A>and set the women upon several expiations, as if he had been some extraordinary 
<A NAME="998"></A>being, and one beloved by the gods, that had been slain. And the Alexandrians 
<A NAME="999"></A>made processions to the place, and gave Cleomenes the title of hero, and 
<A NAME="1000"></A>son of the gods, till the philosophers satisfied them by saying, that as 
<A NAME="1001"></A>oxen breed bees, putrifying horses breed wasps, and beetles rise from the 
<A NAME="1002"></A>carcasses of dead asses, so the humours and juices of the marrow of a man's 
<A NAME="1003"></A>body, coagulating, produce serpents. And this the ancients observing, appropriate 
<A NAME="1004"></A>a serpent, rather than any other creature, to heroes.
