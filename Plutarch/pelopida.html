<BR>(legendary, died 364 B.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>CATO major, hearing some commend one that was rash, and inconsiderately 
<A NAME="11"></A>daring in a battle, said, "There is a difference between a man's prizing 
<A NAME="12"></A>valour at a great rate, and valuing life at little; a very just remark. 
<A NAME="13"></A>Antigonus, we know, at least, had a soldier, a venturous fellow, but of 
<A NAME="14"></A>wretched health and constitution; the reason of whose ill-look he took 
<A NAME="15"></A>the trouble to inquire into; and, on understanding from him that it was 
<A NAME="16"></A>a disease, commanded his physicians to employ their utmost skill, and if 
<A NAME="17"></A>possible recover him; which brave hero, when once cured, never afterwards 
<A NAME="18"></A>sought danger or showed himself venturous in battle; and, when Antigonus 
<A NAME="19"></A>wondered and upbraided him with his change, made no secret of the reason, 
<A NAME="20"></A>and said, "Sir, you are the cause of my cowardice, by freeing me from those 
<A NAME="21"></A>miseries which made me care little for life." With the same feeling, the 
<A NAME="22"></A>Sybarite seems to have said of the Spartans, that it was no commendable 
<A NAME="23"></A>thing in them to be so ready to die in the wars, since by that they were 
<A NAME="24"></A>freed from such hard labour and miserable living. In truth, the Sybarites, 
<A NAME="25"></A>a soft and dissolute people, might well imagine they hated life, because 
<A NAME="26"></A>in their eager pursuit of virtue and glory they were not afraid to die; 
<A NAME="27"></A>but, in fact, the Lacedaemonians found their virtue secured them happiness 
<A NAME="28"></A>alike in living or in dying; as we see in the epitaph that 
<A NAME="29"></A>says-
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>"They died, but not as lavish of their blood,
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>Or thinking death itself was simply good;
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>Their wishes neither were to live nor die,
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>But to do both alike commendably."
<A NAME="34"></A><BR><BR>An endeavour to avoid death is not blamable, if we do not basely 
<A NAME="35"></A>desire to live; nor a willingness to die good and virtuous, if it proceeds 
<A NAME="36"></A>from a contempt of life. And therefore Homer always takes care to bring 
<A NAME="37"></A>his bravest and most daring heroes well armed into battle; and the Greek 
<A NAME="38"></A>law-givers punished those that threw away their shields, but not him that 
<A NAME="39"></A>lost his sword or spear; intimating that self-defence is more a man's business 
<A NAME="40"></A>than offence. This is especially true of a governor of a city, or a general; 
<A NAME="41"></A>for it, as Iphicrates divides it out, the light-armed are the hands; the 
<A NAME="42"></A>horse the feet; the infantry the breast; and the general the head; and, 
<A NAME="43"></A>when he puts himself upon danger, not only ventures his own person, but 
<A NAME="44"></A>all those whose safety depends on his; and so on the contrary. Callicratidas, 
<A NAME="45"></A>therefore, though otherwise a great man, was wrong in his answer to the 
<A NAME="46"></A>augur who advised him, the sacrifice being unlucky, to be careful of his 
<A NAME="47"></A>life; "Sparta," said he, "will not miss one man." It is true, Callicratidas, 
<A NAME="48"></A>when simply serving in any engagement either at sea or land, was but a 
<A NAME="49"></A>single person, but as a general, he united in his life the lives of all, 
<A NAME="50"></A>and could hardly be called one when his death involved the ruin of so many. 
<A NAME="51"></A>The saying of old Antigonus was better, who, when he was to fight at Andros, 
<A NAME="52"></A>and one told him, "The enemy's ships are more than ours;" replied, "For 
<A NAME="53"></A>how many then wilt thou reckon me?" intimating that a brave and experienced 
<A NAME="54"></A>commander is to be highly valued, one of the first duties of whose office 
<A NAME="55"></A>indeed it is to save him on whose safety depends that of others. And therefore 
<A NAME="56"></A>I applaud Timotheus, who, when Chares showed the wounds he had received, 
<A NAME="57"></A>and his shield pierced by a dart, told him, "Yet how ashamed I was, at 
<A NAME="58"></A>the siege of Samos, when a dart fell near me, for exposing myself, more 
<A NAME="59"></A>like a boy than like a general in command of a large army." Indeed, where 
<A NAME="60"></A>the general's hazarding himself will go far to decide the result, there 
<A NAME="61"></A>he must fight and venture his person, and not mind their maxims, who would 
<A NAME="62"></A>have a general die, if not of, at least in old age; but when the advantage 
<A NAME="63"></A>will be but small if he gets the better, and the loss considerable if he 
<A NAME="64"></A>falls, who then would desire, at the risk of the commander's life, a piece 
<A NAME="65"></A>of success which a common soldier might obtain? This I thought fit to premise 
<A NAME="66"></A>before the lives of Pelopidas and Marcellus, who were both great men, but 
<A NAME="67"></A>who both fell by their own rashness. For, being gallant men, and having 
<A NAME="68"></A>gained their respective countries great glory and reputation by their conduct 
<A NAME="69"></A>in war against terrible enemies, the one, as history relates, overthrowing 
<A NAME="70"></A>Hannibal, who was till then invincible; the other, in a set battle beating 
<A NAME="71"></A>the Lacedaemonians, then supreme both at sea and land; they ventured at 
<A NAME="72"></A>last too far, and were heedlessly prodigal of their lives, when there was 
<A NAME="73"></A>the greatest need of men and commanders such as they. And this agreement 
<A NAME="74"></A>in their characters and their deaths is the reason why I compare their 
<A NAME="75"></A>lives.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR>Pelopidas, the son of Hippoclus, was descended, as likewise Epaminondas 
<A NAME="77"></A>was, from an honourable family in Thebes; and, being brought up to opulence, 
<A NAME="78"></A>and having a fair estate left him whilst he was young, he made it his business 
<A NAME="79"></A>to relieve the good and deserving amongst the poor, that he might show 
<A NAME="80"></A>himself lord and not slave of his estate. For amongst men, as Aristotle 
<A NAME="81"></A>observes, some are too narrow-minded to use their wealth, and some are 
<A NAME="82"></A>loose and abuse it; and these live perpetual slaves to their pleasures, 
<A NAME="83"></A>as the others to their gain. Others permitted themselves to be obliged 
<A NAME="84"></A>by Pelopidas, and thankfully made use of his liberality and kindness; but 
<A NAME="85"></A>amongst all his friends he could never persuade Epaminondas to be a sharer 
<A NAME="86"></A>in his wealth. He, however, stepped down into his poverty, and took pleasure 
<A NAME="87"></A>in the same poor attire, spare diet, unwearied endurance of hardships, 
<A NAME="88"></A>and unshrinking boldness in war; like Capaneus in Euripides, who 
<A NAME="89"></A>had-
<A NAME="90"></A><BR><BR>"Abundant wealth and in that wealth no pride," he was ashamed any 
<A NAME="91"></A>one should think that he spent more upon his person than the meanest Theban. 
<A NAME="92"></A>Epaminondas made his familiar and hereditary poverty more light and easy 
<A NAME="93"></A>by his philosophy and single life; but Pelopidas married a woman of good 
<A NAME="94"></A>family, and had children; yet still thinking little of his private interests, 
<A NAME="95"></A>and devoting all his time to the public, he ruined his estate: and, when 
<A NAME="96"></A>his friends admonished and told him how necessary that money which he neglected 
<A NAME="97"></A>was: "Yes," he replied, "necessary to Nicodemus," pointing to a blind 
<A NAME="98"></A>cripple.
<A NAME="99"></A><BR><BR>Both seemed equally fitted by nature for all sorts of excellence; 
<A NAME="100"></A>but bodily exercises chiefly delighted Pelopidas, learning Epaminondas; 
<A NAME="101"></A>and the one spent his spare hours in hunting and the Palaestra, the other 
<A NAME="102"></A>in hearing lectures or philosophizing. And, amongst a thousand points for 
<A NAME="103"></A>praise in both, the judicious esteem nothing equal to that constant benevolence 
<A NAME="104"></A>and friendship, which they inviolably preserved in all their expeditions, 
<A NAME="105"></A>public actions, and administration of the commonwealth. For if any one 
<A NAME="106"></A>looks on the administrations of Aristides and Themistocles, of Cimon and 
<A NAME="107"></A>Pericles, of Nicias and Alcibiades, what confusion, what envy, what mutual 
<A NAME="108"></A>jealousy appears? And if he then casts his eye on the kindness and reverence 
<A NAME="109"></A>that Pelopidas showed Epaminondas, he must needs confess that these are 
<A NAME="110"></A>more truly and more justly styled colleagues in government and command 
<A NAME="111"></A>than the others, who strove rather to overcome one another than their enemies. 
<A NAME="112"></A>The true cause of this was their virtue; whence it came that they did not 
<A NAME="113"></A>make their actions aim at wealth and glory, an endeavour sure to lead to 
<A NAME="114"></A>bitter and contentious jealousy; but both from the beginning being inflamed 
<A NAME="115"></A>with a divine desire of seeing their country glorious by their exertions, 
<A NAME="116"></A>they used to that end one another's excellences as their own. Many, indeed, 
<A NAME="117"></A>think this strict and entire affection is to be dated from the battle at 
<A NAME="118"></A>Mantinea, where they both fought, being part of the succours that were 
<A NAME="119"></A>sent from Thebes to the Lacedaemonians, their then friends and allies. 
<A NAME="120"></A>For, being placed together amongst the infantry, and engaging the Arcadians, 
<A NAME="121"></A>when the Lacedaemonian wing, in which they fought, gave ground, and many 
<A NAME="122"></A>fled, they closed their shields together and resisted the assailants. Pelopidas, 
<A NAME="123"></A>having received seven wounds in the forepart of his body, fell upon an 
<A NAME="124"></A>heap of slain friends and enemies; but Epaminondas, though he thought him 
<A NAME="125"></A>past recovery, advanced to defend his arms and body, and singly fought 
<A NAME="126"></A>a multitude, resolving rather to die than forsake his helpless Pelopidas. 
<A NAME="127"></A>And now, he being much distressed, being wounded in the breast by a spear, 
<A NAME="128"></A>and in the arm by a sword, Agesipolis, the King of the Spartans, came to 
<A NAME="129"></A>his succour from the other wing, and beyond hope delivered 
<A NAME="130"></A>both.
<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR>After this the Lacedaemonians pretended to be friends to Thebes, 
<A NAME="132"></A>but in truth looked with jealous suspicions on the designs and power of 
<A NAME="133"></A>the city, and chiefly hated the party of Ismenias and Androclides, in which 
<A NAME="134"></A>Pelopidas also was an associate, as tending to liberty and the advancement 
<A NAME="135"></A>of the commonalty. Therefore Archias, Leontidas, and Philip, all rich men, 
<A NAME="136"></A>and of oligarchical principles, and immoderately ambitious, urged Phoebidas 
<A NAME="137"></A>the Spartan, as he was on his way past the city with a considerable force, 
<A NAME="138"></A>to surprise the Cadmea, and, banishing the contrary faction, to establish 
<A NAME="139"></A>an oligarchy, and by that means subject the city to the supremacy of the 
<A NAME="140"></A>Spartans. He, accepting the proposal, at the festival of Ceres unexpectedly 
<A NAME="141"></A>fell on the Thebans, and made himself master of the citadel. Ismenias was 
<A NAME="142"></A>taken, carried to Sparta, and in a short time murdered; but Pelopidas, 
<A NAME="143"></A>Pherenicus, Androclides, and many more that fled were publicly proclaimed 
<A NAME="144"></A>outlaws. Epaminondas stayed at home, being not much looked after, as one 
<A NAME="145"></A>whom philosophy had made inactive and poverty incapable.
<A NAME="146"></A><BR><BR>The Lacedaemonians cashiered Phoebidas, and fined him one hundred 
<A NAME="147"></A>thousand drachmas, yet still kept a garrison in the Cadmea; which made 
<A NAME="148"></A>all Greece wonder at their inconsistency, since they punished the doer, 
<A NAME="149"></A>but approved the deed. And though the Thebans, having lost their polity, 
<A NAME="150"></A>and being enslaved by Archias and Leontidas, had no hopes to get free from 
<A NAME="151"></A>this tyranny, which they saw guarded by the whole military power of the 
<A NAME="152"></A>Spartans, and had no means to break the yoke, unless these could be deposed 
<A NAME="153"></A>from their command of sea and land; yet Leontidas and his associates, understanding 
<A NAME="154"></A>the exiles lived at Athens in favour with the people, and with honour from 
<A NAME="155"></A>all the good and virtuous, formed secret designs against their lives, and, 
<A NAME="156"></A>suborning some unknown fellows, despatched Androclides, but were not successful 
<A NAME="157"></A>on the rest. Letters, besides, were sent from Sparta to the Athenians, 
<A NAME="158"></A>warning them neither to receive nor countenance the exiles, but expel them 
<A NAME="159"></A>as declared common enemies of the confederacy. But the Athenians, from 
<A NAME="160"></A>their natural hereditary inclination to be kind, and also to make a grateful 
<A NAME="161"></A>return to the Thebans, who had very much assisted them in restoring their 
<A NAME="162"></A>democracy, and had publicly enacted, that if any Athenian would march armed 
<A NAME="163"></A>through Boeotia against the tyrants, that no Boeotian should either see 
<A NAME="164"></A>or hear it, did the Thebans no harm.
<A NAME="165"></A><BR><BR>Pelopidas, though one of the youngest, was active in privately 
<A NAME="166"></A>exciting each single exile; and often told them at their meetings that 
<A NAME="167"></A>it was both dishonourable and impious to neglect their enslaved and engarrisoned 
<A NAME="168"></A>country, and, lazily contented with their own lives and safety, depend 
<A NAME="169"></A>on the decree of the Athenians, and through fear fawn on every smooth-tongued 
<A NAME="170"></A>orator that was able to work upon the people: no, they must venture for 
<A NAME="171"></A>this great prize, taking Thrasybulus's bold courage for example, and as 
<A NAME="172"></A>he advanced from Thebes and broke the power of the Athenian tyrants, so 
<A NAME="173"></A>they should march from Athens and free Thebes. When by this method he had 
<A NAME="174"></A>persuaded them, they privately despatched some persons to those friends 
<A NAME="175"></A>they had left at Thebes, and acquainted them with their designs. Their 
<A NAME="176"></A>plans being approved, Charon, a man of the greatest distinction, offered 
<A NAME="177"></A>his house for their reception; Phillidas contrived to get himself made 
<A NAME="178"></A>secretary to Archias and Philip, who then held the office of polemarch 
<A NAME="179"></A>or chief captain; and Epaminondas had already inflamed the youth. For, 
<A NAME="180"></A>in their exercises, he had encouraged them to challenge and wrestle with 
<A NAME="181"></A>the Spartans, and again, when he saw them puffed up with victory and success, 
<A NAME="182"></A>sharply told them, that it was the greatest shame to be such cowards as 
<A NAME="183"></A>to serve those whom in strength they so much excelled.
<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR>The day of action being fixed, it was agreed upon by the exiles 
<A NAME="185"></A>that Pherenicus with the rest should stay at the Thriasian plain, while 
<A NAME="186"></A>some few of the younger men tried the first danger, by endeavouring to 
<A NAME="187"></A>get into the city; and, if they were surprised by their enemies, the others 
<A NAME="188"></A>should take care to provide for their children and parents. Pelopidas first 
<A NAME="189"></A>offered to undertake the business; then Melon, Damoclides, and Theopompus, 
<A NAME="190"></A>men of noble families, who, in other things loving and faithful to one 
<A NAME="191"></A>another, were rivals constant only in glory and courageous exploits. They 
<A NAME="192"></A>were twelve in all, and having taken leave of those that stayed behind 
<A NAME="193"></A>sent a messenger to Charon, they went forward, clad in short coats, and 
<A NAME="194"></A>carrying hounds and hunting-poles with them, that they might be taken for 
<A NAME="195"></A>hunters beating over the fields, and prevent all suspicion in those that 
<A NAME="196"></A>met them on the way. When the messenger came to Charon, and told him they 
<A NAME="197"></A>were approaching, he did not change his resolution at the sight of danger, 
<A NAME="198"></A>but, being a man of his word, offered them his house. But one Hipposthenidas, 
<A NAME="199"></A>a man of no ill principles, a lover of his country, and a friend to the 
<A NAME="200"></A>exiles, but not of as much resolution as the shortness of time and the 
<A NAME="201"></A>character of the action required, being as it were dizzied at the greatness 
<A NAME="202"></A>of the approaching enterprise; and beginning now for the first time to 
<A NAME="203"></A>comprehend that, relying on that weak assistance which could be expected 
<A NAME="204"></A>from the exiles, they were undertaking no less a task than to shake the 
<A NAME="205"></A>government, and overthrow the whole power of Sparta; went privately to 
<A NAME="206"></A>his house and sent a friend to Melon and Pelopidas, desiring them to forbear 
<A NAME="207"></A>for the present, to return to Athens and expect a better opportunity. The 
<A NAME="208"></A>messenger's name was Chlidon, who, going home in haste and bringing out 
<A NAME="209"></A>his horse, asked for the bridle; but, his wife not knowing where it was, 
<A NAME="210"></A>and, when it could not be found, telling him she had lent it to a friend, 
<A NAME="211"></A>first they began to chide, then to curse one another, and his wife wished 
<A NAME="212"></A>the journey might prove ill to him and those that sent him; insomuch that 
<A NAME="213"></A>Chlidon's passion made him waste a great part of the day in this quarrelling, 
<A NAME="214"></A>and then, looking on this chance as an omen, he laid aside all thoughts 
<A NAME="215"></A>of his journey, and went away to some other business. So nearly had these 
<A NAME="216"></A>great and glorious designs, even in their very birth, lost their 
<A NAME="217"></A>opportunity.
<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR>But Pelopidas and his companions, dressing themselves like countrymen, 
<A NAME="219"></A>divided, and, whilst it was yet day, entered at different quarters of the 
<A NAME="220"></A>city. It was, besides, a windy day, and now it just began to snow, which 
<A NAME="221"></A>contributed much to their concealment, because most people were gone indoors 
<A NAME="222"></A>to avoid the weather. Those, however, that were concerned in the design 
<A NAME="223"></A>received them as they came, and conducted them to Charon's house, where 
<A NAME="224"></A>the exiles and others made up forty-eight in number. The tyrant's affairs 
<A NAME="225"></A>stood thus: the secretary, Phillidas, as I have already observed, was an 
<A NAME="226"></A>accomplice in and privy to all the contrivance of the exiles, and he a 
<A NAME="227"></A>while before had invited Archias, with others, to an entertainment on that 
<A NAME="228"></A>day, to drink freely, and meet some women of the town, on purpose that 
<A NAME="229"></A>when they were drunk, and given up to their pleasures, he might deliver 
<A NAME="230"></A>them over to the conspirators. But before Archias was thoroughly heated 
<A NAME="231"></A>notice was given him that the exiles were privately in the town; a true 
<A NAME="232"></A>report indeed, but obscure, and not well confirmed: nevertheless, though 
<A NAME="233"></A>Phillidas endeavoured to divert the discourse, Archias sent one of his 
<A NAME="234"></A>guards to Charon, and commanded him to attend immediately. It was evening, 
<A NAME="235"></A>and Pelopidas and his friends with him in the house were putting themselves 
<A NAME="236"></A>into a fit posture for action, having their breastplates on already, and 
<A NAME="237"></A>their swords girt: but at the sudden knocking at the door, one stepping 
<A NAME="238"></A>forth to inquire the matter, and learning from the officer that Charon 
<A NAME="239"></A>was sent for by the polemarch, returned in great confusion and acquainted 
<A NAME="240"></A>those within; and immediately conjectured that the whole plot was discovered, 
<A NAME="241"></A>and they should be cut in pieces, before so much as achieving any action 
<A NAME="242"></A>to do credit to their bravery: yet all agreed that Charon should obey and 
<A NAME="243"></A>attend the polemarch to prevent suspicion. Charon was, indeed, a man of 
<A NAME="244"></A>courage and resolution in all dangers, yet in this case he was extremely 
<A NAME="245"></A>concerned, lest any should suspect that he was the traitor and the death 
<A NAME="246"></A>of so many brave citizens he laid on him. And, therefore, when he was ready 
<A NAME="247"></A>to depart, he brought his son out of the women's apartment, a little boy 
<A NAME="248"></A>as yet, but one of the best looking and strongest of all those of his age, 
<A NAME="249"></A>and delivered him to Pelopidas with these words: "If you find me a traitor, 
<A NAME="250"></A>treat the boy as an enemy without any mercy." The concern which Charon 
<A NAME="251"></A>showed drew tears from many; but all protested vehemently against his supposing 
<A NAME="252"></A>any one of them so mean-spirited and base, at the appearance of approaching 
<A NAME="253"></A>danger, as to suspect or blame him; and therefore desired him not to involve 
<A NAME="254"></A>his son, but to set him out of harm's way: that so he, perhaps escaping 
<A NAME="255"></A>the tyrant's power, might live to revenge the city and his friends. Charon, 
<A NAME="256"></A>however, refused to remove him, and asked, "What life, what safety could 
<A NAME="257"></A>be more honourable, than to die bravely with his father and such generous 
<A NAME="258"></A>companions?" Thus, imploring the protection of the gods, and saluting and 
<A NAME="259"></A>encouraging them all, he departed, considering with himself, and composing 
<A NAME="260"></A>his voice and countenance, that he might look as little like as possible 
<A NAME="261"></A>to what in fact he really was.
<A NAME="262"></A><BR><BR>When he was come to the door, Archias with Phillidas came out to 
<A NAME="263"></A>him, and said, "I have heard, Charon, that there are some men just come, 
<A NAME="264"></A>and lurking in the town, and that some of the citizens are resorting to 
<A NAME="265"></A>them." Charon was at first disturbed, but asking, "Who are they? and who 
<A NAME="266"></A>conceals them?" and finding Archias did not thoroughly understand the matter, 
<A NAME="267"></A>he concluded that none of those privy to the design had given this information, 
<A NAME="268"></A>and replied, "Do not disturb yourselves for an empty rumour: I will look 
<A NAME="269"></A>into it, however, for no report in such a case is to be neglected." Phillidas, 
<A NAME="270"></A>who stood by, commended him, and leading back Archias, got him deep in 
<A NAME="271"></A>drink, still prolonging the entertainment with the hopes of the women's 
<A NAME="272"></A>company at last. But when Charon returned, and found the men prepared, 
<A NAME="273"></A>not as if they hoped for safety and success, but to die bravely and with 
<A NAME="274"></A>the slaughter of their enemies, he told Pelopidas and his friends the truth, 
<A NAME="275"></A>but pretended to others in the house that Archias talked to him about something 
<A NAME="276"></A>else, inventing a story for the occasion. This storm was just blowing over, 
<A NAME="277"></A>when fortune brought another; for a messenger came with a letter from one 
<A NAME="278"></A>Archias, the Hierophant at Athens, to his namesake Archias, who was his 
<A NAME="279"></A>friend and guest. This did not merely contain a vague conjectural suspicion, 
<A NAME="280"></A>but, as it appeared afterwards, disclosed every particular of the design. 
<A NAME="281"></A>The messenger being brought in to Archias, who was now pretty well drunk, 
<A NAME="282"></A>and delivering the letter, said to him, "The writer of this desired it 
<A NAME="283"></A>might be read at once; it is on urgent business." Archias, with a smile, 
<A NAME="284"></A>replied, "Urgent business tomorrow," and so receiving the letter, he put 
<A NAME="285"></A>it under his pillow, and returned to what he had been speaking of with 
<A NAME="286"></A>Phillidas, and these words of his are a proverb to this day amongst the 
<A NAME="287"></A>Greeks.
<A NAME="288"></A><BR><BR>Now when the opportunity seemed convenient for action, they set 
<A NAME="289"></A>out in two companies; Pelopidas and Damoclides with their party went against 
<A NAME="290"></A>Leontidas and Hypates, that lived near together; Charon and Melon against 
<A NAME="291"></A>Archias and Philip, having put on women's apparel over their breastplates, 
<A NAME="292"></A>and thick garlands of fir and pine to shade their faces; and so, as soon 
<A NAME="293"></A>as they came to the door, the guests clapped and gave an huzza, supposing 
<A NAME="294"></A>them to be the women they expected. But when the conspirators had looked 
<A NAME="295"></A>about the room, and carefully marked all that were at the entertainment, 
<A NAME="296"></A>they drew their swords, and making at Archias and Philip amongst the tables, 
<A NAME="297"></A>disclosed who they were. Phillidas persuaded some few of his guests to 
<A NAME="298"></A>sit still, and those that got up and endeavoured to assist the polemarch, 
<A NAME="299"></A>being drunk, were easily despatched. But Pelopidas and his party met with 
<A NAME="300"></A>a harder task; as they attempted Leontidas, a sober and formidable man, 
<A NAME="301"></A>and when they came to his house found his door shut, he being already gone 
<A NAME="302"></A>to bed. They knocked a long time before any one would answer, but at last, 
<A NAME="303"></A>a servant that heard them, coming out and unbarring the door, as soon as 
<A NAME="304"></A>the gate gave way, they rushed in, and, overturning the man, made all haste 
<A NAME="305"></A>to Leontidas's chamber. But Leontidas, guessing at the matter by the noise 
<A NAME="306"></A>and running, leaped from his bed and drew his dagger, but forgot to put 
<A NAME="307"></A>out the lights, and by that means make them fall foul of one another in 
<A NAME="308"></A>the dark. As it was, being easily seen by reason of the light, he received 
<A NAME="309"></A>them at his chamber door and stabbed Cephisodorus, the first man that entered: 
<A NAME="310"></A>on his falling, the next that he engaged was Pelopidas; and the passage 
<A NAME="311"></A>being narrow and Cephisodorus's body lying in the way, there was a fierce 
<A NAME="312"></A>and dangerous conflict. At last Pelopidas prevailed, and having killed 
<A NAME="313"></A>Leontidas, he and his companions went in pursuit of Hypates, and after 
<A NAME="314"></A>the same manner broke into his house. He perceived the design and fled 
<A NAME="315"></A>to his neighbours; but they closely followed, and caught and killed 
<A NAME="316"></A>him.
<A NAME="317"></A><BR><BR>This done they joined Melon and sent to hasten the exiles they 
<A NAME="318"></A>had left in Attica: and called upon the citizens to maintain their liberty, 
<A NAME="319"></A>and taking down the spoils from the porches, and breaking open all the 
<A NAME="320"></A>armourers' shops that were near, equipped those that came to their assistance. 
<A NAME="321"></A>Epaminondas and Gorgidas came in already armed, with a gallant train of 
<A NAME="322"></A>young men and the best of the old. Now the city was in a great excitement 
<A NAME="323"></A>and confusion, a great noise and hurry, lights set up in every house, men 
<A NAME="324"></A>running here and there; however, the people did not as yet gather into 
<A NAME="325"></A>a body, but, amazed at the proceedings, and not clearly understanding the 
<A NAME="326"></A>matter, waited for the day. And, therefore, the Spartan officers were thought 
<A NAME="327"></A>to have been in fault for not falling on at once, since their garrison 
<A NAME="328"></A>consisted of about fifteen hundred men, and many of the citizens ran to 
<A NAME="329"></A>them; but, alarmed with the noise, the fires, and the confused running 
<A NAME="330"></A>of the people, they kept quietly within the Cadmea. As soon as day appeared, 
<A NAME="331"></A>the exiles from Attica came in armed, and there was a general assembly 
<A NAME="332"></A>of the people. Epaminondas and Gorgidas brought forth Pelopidas and his 
<A NAME="333"></A>party, encompassed by the priests, who held out garlands, and exhorted 
<A NAME="334"></A>the people to fight for their country and their gods. The assembly, at 
<A NAME="335"></A>their appearance, rose up in a body and with shouts and acclamations received 
<A NAME="336"></A>the men as their deliverers and benefactors.
<A NAME="337"></A><BR><BR>Then Pelopidas, being chosen chief captain of Boeotia, together 
<A NAME="338"></A>with Melon and Charon, proceeded at once to blockade the citadel and stormed 
<A NAME="339"></A>it on all sides, being extremely desirous to expel the Lacedaemonians, 
<A NAME="340"></A>and free the Cadmea, before an army could come from Sparta to their relief. 
<A NAME="341"></A>And he just so narrowly succeeded, that they, having surrendered on terms 
<A NAME="342"></A>and departed, on their way home met Cleombrotus at Megara marching towards 
<A NAME="343"></A>Thebes with a considerable force. The Spartans condemned and executed Herippidas 
<A NAME="344"></A>and Arcissus, two of their governors, at Thebes, and Lysanoridas the third, 
<A NAME="345"></A>being severely fined, fled to Peloponnesus. This action so closely resembling 
<A NAME="346"></A>that of Thrasybulus, in the courage of the actors, the danger, the encounters, 
<A NAME="347"></A>and equally crowned with success, was called the sister of it by the Greeks. 
<A NAME="348"></A>For we can scarcely find any other examples where so small and weak a party 
<A NAME="349"></A>of men by bold courage overcame such numerous and powerful enemies, or 
<A NAME="350"></A>brought greater blessings to their country by so doing. But the subsequent 
<A NAME="351"></A>change of affairs made this action the more famous; for the war which forever 
<A NAME="352"></A>ruined the pretensions of Sparta to command, and put an end to the supremacy 
<A NAME="353"></A>she then exercised alike by sea and by land, proceeded from that night, 
<A NAME="354"></A>in which Pelopidas not surprising any fort, or castle, or citadel, but 
<A NAME="355"></A>coming, the twelfth man, to a private house, loosed and broke, if we may 
<A NAME="356"></A>speak truth in metaphor, the chains of the Spartan sway, which before seemed 
<A NAME="357"></A>of adamant and indissoluble.
<A NAME="358"></A><BR><BR>But now the Lacedaemonians invading Boeotia with a great army, 
<A NAME="359"></A>the Athenians, affrighted at the danger, declared themselves no allies 
<A NAME="360"></A>to Thebes, and prosecuting those that stood for the Boeotian interest, 
<A NAME="361"></A>executed some, and banished and fined others: and the cause of Thebes, 
<A NAME="362"></A>destitute of allies, seemed in a desperate condition. But Pelopidas and 
<A NAME="363"></A>Gorgidas, holding the office of captains of Boeotia, designing to breed 
<A NAME="364"></A>a quarrel between the Lacedaemonians and Athenians, made this contrivance. 
<A NAME="365"></A>One Sphodrias, a Spartan, a man famous indeed for courage in battle, but 
<A NAME="366"></A>of no sound judgment, full of ungrounded hopes and foolish ambition, was 
<A NAME="367"></A>left with an army at Thespiae, to receive and succour the Theban renegades. 
<A NAME="368"></A>To him Pelopidas and his colleagues privately sent a merchant, one of their 
<A NAME="369"></A>friends, with money, and, what proved more efficient, advice- that it more 
<A NAME="370"></A>became a man of his worth to set upon some great enterprise, and that he 
<A NAME="371"></A>should, making a sudden incursion on the unprotected Athenians, surprise 
<A NAME="372"></A>the Piraeus; since nothing could be so grateful to Sparta as to take Athens; 
<A NAME="373"></A>and the Thebans, of course, would not stir to the assistance of men whom 
<A NAME="374"></A>they now hated and looked upon as traitors. Sphodrias, being at last wrought 
<A NAME="375"></A>upon, marched into Attica by night with his army, and advanced as far as 
<A NAME="376"></A>Eleusis; but there his soldiers' hearts failing, after exposing his project 
<A NAME="377"></A>and involving the Spartans in a dangerous war, he retreated to Thespiae. 
<A NAME="378"></A>After this the Athenians zealously sent supplies to Thebes, and putting 
<A NAME="379"></A>to sea, sailed to many places, and offered support and protection to all 
<A NAME="380"></A>those of the Greeks who were willing to revolt.
<A NAME="381"></A><BR><BR>The Thebans, meantime, singly, having many skirmishes with the 
<A NAME="382"></A>Spartans in Boeotia, and fighting some battles, not great indeed, but important 
<A NAME="383"></A>as training and instructing them, thus had their minds raised, and their 
<A NAME="384"></A>bodies inured to labour, and gained both experience and courage by these 
<A NAME="385"></A>frequent encounters, insomuch that we have it related that Antalcidas, 
<A NAME="386"></A>the Spartan, said to Agesilaus, returning wounded from Boeotia, "Indeed, 
<A NAME="387"></A>the Thebans have paid you handsomely for instructing them in the art of 
<A NAME="388"></A>war, against their wills." In real truth, however, Agesilaus was not their 
<A NAME="389"></A>master in this, but those that prudently and opportunely, as men do young 
<A NAME="390"></A>dogs, set them on their enemies, and brought them safely off after they 
<A NAME="391"></A>had tasted the sweets of victory and resolution. Of all those leaders, 
<A NAME="392"></A>Pelopidas deserves the most honour: as after they had once chosen him general, 
<A NAME="393"></A>he was every year in command as long as he lived; either captain of the 
<A NAME="394"></A>sacred band, or, what was most frequent, chief captain of Boeotia. About 
<A NAME="395"></A>Plataea and Thespiae the Spartans were routed and put to flight, and Phoebidas, 
<A NAME="396"></A>that surprised the Cadmea, slain; and at Tanagra a considerable force was 
<A NAME="397"></A>worsted, and the leader Panthoides killed. But these encounters, though 
<A NAME="398"></A>they raised the victors' spirits, did not thoroughly dishearten the unsuccessful; 
<A NAME="399"></A>for there was no set battle, or regular fighting, but mere incursions on 
<A NAME="400"></A>advantage, in which, according to occasion, they charged, retired again, 
<A NAME="401"></A>or pursued. But the battle at Tegyrae, which seemed a prelude to Leuctra, 
<A NAME="402"></A>won Pelopidas great reputation; for none of the other commanders could 
<A NAME="403"></A>claim any hand in the design, nor the enemies any show of victory. The 
<A NAME="404"></A>city of the Orchomenians siding with the Spartans, and having received 
<A NAME="405"></A>two companies for its guard, he kept a constant eye upon it, and watched 
<A NAME="406"></A>his opportunity. Hearing that the garrison had moved into Locris, and hoping 
<A NAME="407"></A>to find Orchomenus defenceless, he marched with his sacred band and some 
<A NAME="408"></A>few horsemen. But when he approached the city, and found that a reinforcement 
<A NAME="409"></A>of the garrison was on its, march from Sparta, he made a circuit round 
<A NAME="410"></A>the foot of the mountains, and retreated with his little army through Tegyrae, 
<A NAME="411"></A>that being the only way he could pass. For the river Melas, almost as soon 
<A NAME="412"></A>as it rises, spreads itself into marshes and navigable pools, and makes 
<A NAME="413"></A>all the plain between impassable. A little below the marshes stands the 
<A NAME="414"></A>temple and oracle of Apollo Tegyraeus, forsaken not long before that time, 
<A NAME="415"></A>having flourished till the Median wars, Echecrates then being priest. Here 
<A NAME="416"></A>they profess that the god was born; the neighbouring mountain is called 
<A NAME="417"></A>Delos, and there the river Melas comes again into a channel; beyond the 
<A NAME="418"></A>temples rises two springs, admirable for the sweetness, abundance, and 
<A NAME="419"></A>coolness of the streams; one they called Phoenix, the other Elaea, even 
<A NAME="420"></A>to the present time, as if Lucina had not been delivered between two trees, 
<A NAME="421"></A>but fountains. A place hard by, called Ptoum, is shown, where they say 
<A NAME="422"></A>she was affrighted by the appearance of a boar; and the stories of the 
<A NAME="423"></A>Python and Tityus are in like manner appropriated by these localities. 
<A NAME="424"></A>I omit many of the points that are used as arguments. For our tradition 
<A NAME="425"></A>does not rank this god amongst those that were born, and then made immortal, 
<A NAME="426"></A>as Hercules and Bacchus, whom their virtue raised above a mortal and passable 
<A NAME="427"></A>condition; but Apollo is one of the eternal unbegotten deities, if we may 
<A NAME="428"></A>collect any certainty concerning these things, from the statements of the 
<A NAME="429"></A>oldest and wisest in such subjects.
<A NAME="430"></A><BR><BR>As the Thebans were retreating from Orchomenus towards Tegyrae, 
<A NAME="431"></A>the Spartans, at the same time marching from Locris, met them. As soon 
<A NAME="432"></A>as they came in view, advancing through the straits, one told Pelopidas, 
<A NAME="433"></A>"We are fallen into our enemy's hands;" he replied, "And why not they into 
<A NAME="434"></A>ours?" and immediately commanded his horse to come up from the rear and 
<A NAME="435"></A>charge, while he himself drew his infantry, being three hundred in number, 
<A NAME="436"></A>into a close body, hoping by that means, at whatsoever point he made the 
<A NAME="437"></A>attack, to break his way through his more numerous enemies. The Spartans 
<A NAME="438"></A>had two companies (the company consisting, as Ephorus states, of five hundred; 
<A NAME="439"></A>Callisthenes says seven hundred; others, as Polybius, nine hundred); and 
<A NAME="440"></A>their leaders, Gorgoleon and Theopompus, confident of success, advanced 
<A NAME="441"></A>upon the Thebans. The charge being made with much fury, chiefly where the 
<A NAME="442"></A>commanders were posted, the Spartan captains that engaged Pelopidas were 
<A NAME="443"></A>first killed; and those immediately around them suffering severely, the 
<A NAME="444"></A>whole army was thus disheartened, and opened a lane for the Thebans as 
<A NAME="445"></A>if they desired to pass through and escape. But when Pelopidas entered, 
<A NAME="446"></A>and turning against those that stood their ground, still went with a bloody 
<A NAME="447"></A>slaughter, an open flight ensued amongst the Spartans. The pursuit was 
<A NAME="448"></A>carried but a little way, because they feared the neighbouring Orchomenians 
<A NAME="449"></A>and the reinforcements from Lacedaemon; they had succeeded, however, in 
<A NAME="450"></A>fighting a way through their enemies, and overpowering their whole force; 
<A NAME="451"></A>and, therefore, erecting a trophy, and spoiling the slain, they returned 
<A NAME="452"></A>home extremely encouraged with their achievements. For in all the great 
<A NAME="453"></A>wars there had ever been against Greeks or barbarians, the Spartans were 
<A NAME="454"></A>never before beaten by a smaller company than their own; nor, indeed, in 
<A NAME="455"></A>a set battle, when their number was equal. Hence their courage was thought 
<A NAME="456"></A>irresistible, and their high repute before the battle made a conquest already 
<A NAME="457"></A>of enemies, who thought themselves no match for the men of Sparta even 
<A NAME="458"></A>on equal terms. But this battle first taught the other Greeks, that not 
<A NAME="459"></A>only Eurotas, or the country between Babyce and Cnacion, breeds men of 
<A NAME="460"></A>courage and resolution, but that where the youth are ashamed of baseness, 
<A NAME="461"></A>and ready to venture in a good cause, where they fly disgrace more than 
<A NAME="462"></A>danger, there, wherever it be, are found the bravest and most formidable 
<A NAME="463"></A>opponents.
<A NAME="464"></A><BR><BR>Gorgidas, according to some, first formed the Sacred Band of three 
<A NAME="465"></A>hundred chosen men, to whom, as being a guard for the citadel, the State 
<A NAME="466"></A>allowed provision, and all things necessary for exercise: and hence they 
<A NAME="467"></A>were called the city band, as citadels of old were usually called cities. 
<A NAME="468"></A>Others say that it was composed of young men attached to each other by 
<A NAME="469"></A>personal affection, and a pleasant saying of Pammenes is current, that 
<A NAME="470"></A>Homer's Nestor was not well skilled in ordering an army, when he advised 
<A NAME="471"></A>the Greeks to rank tribe and tribe, and family and family together, 
<A NAME="472"></A>that-
<A NAME="473"></A><BR><BR>"So tribe might tribe, and kinsmen kinsmen aid." but that he should 
<A NAME="474"></A>have joined lovers and their beloved. For men of the same tribe or family 
<A NAME="475"></A>little value one another when dangers press; but a band cemented by friendship 
<A NAME="476"></A>grounded upon love is never to be broken, and invincible; since the lovers, 
<A NAME="477"></A>ashamed to be base in sight of their beloved, and the beloved before their 
<A NAME="478"></A>lovers, willingly rush into danger for the relief of one another. Nor can 
<A NAME="479"></A>that be wondered at since they have more regard for their absent lovers 
<A NAME="480"></A>than for others present; as in the instance of the man who, when his enemy 
<A NAME="481"></A>was going to kill him, earnestly requested him to run him through the breast, 
<A NAME="482"></A>that his lover might not blush to see him wounded in the back. It is a 
<A NAME="483"></A>tradition likewise that Iolaus, who assisted Hercules in his labours and 
<A NAME="484"></A>fought at his side, was beloved of him; and Aristotle observes that, even 
<A NAME="485"></A>in his time, lovers plighted their faith at Iolaus's tomb. It is likely, 
<A NAME="486"></A>therefore, that this band was called sacred on this account; as Plato calls 
<A NAME="487"></A>a lover a divine friend. It is stated that it was never beaten till the 
<A NAME="488"></A>battle at Chaeronea: and when Philip, after the fight, took a view of the 
<A NAME="489"></A>slain, and came to the place where the three hundred that fought his phalanx 
<A NAME="490"></A>lay dead together, he wondered, and understanding that it was the band 
<A NAME="491"></A>of lovers, he shed tears and said, "Perish any man who suspects that these 
<A NAME="492"></A>men either did or suffered anything that was base."
<A NAME="493"></A><BR><BR>It was not the disaster of Laius, as the poets imagine, that first 
<A NAME="494"></A>gave rise to this form of attachment amongst the Thebans, but their lawgivers, 
<A NAME="495"></A>designing to soften whilst they were young their natural fierceness, brought, 
<A NAME="496"></A>for example, the pipe into great esteem, both in serious and sportive occasions, 
<A NAME="497"></A>and gave great encouragement to these friendships in the Palaestra, to 
<A NAME="498"></A>temper the manners and characters of the youth. With a view to this they 
<A NAME="499"></A>did well, again, to make Harmony, the daughter of Mars and Venus, their 
<A NAME="500"></A>tutelar deity; since, where force and courage is joined with gracefulness 
<A NAME="501"></A>and winning behaviour, a harmony ensues that combines all the elements 
<A NAME="502"></A>of society in perfect consonance and order. Gorgidas distributed this Sacred 
<A NAME="503"></A>Band all through the front ranks of the infantry, and thus made their gallantry 
<A NAME="504"></A>less conspicuous; not being united in one body, but mingled with so many 
<A NAME="505"></A>others of inferior resolution, they had no fair opportunity of showing 
<A NAME="506"></A>what they could do. But Pelopidas, having sufficiently tried their bravery 
<A NAME="507"></A>at Tegyrae, where they had fought alone and around his own person, never 
<A NAME="508"></A>afterward divided them, but, keeping them entire, and as one man, gave 
<A NAME="509"></A>them the first duty in the greatest battles. For as horses ran brisker 
<A NAME="510"></A>in a chariot than singly, not that their joint force divides the air with 
<A NAME="511"></A>greater ease, but because being matched one against the other emulation 
<A NAME="512"></A>kindles and inflames their courage; thus he thought brave men, provoking 
<A NAME="513"></A>one another to noble actions, would prove most serviceable, and most resolute, 
<A NAME="514"></A>where all were united together.
<A NAME="515"></A><BR><BR>Now when the Lacedaemonians had made peace with the other Greeks, 
<A NAME="516"></A>and united all their strength against the Thebans only, and their king, 
<A NAME="517"></A>Cleombrotus, had passed the frontier with ten thousand foot and one thousand 
<A NAME="518"></A>horse, and not only subjection, as heretofore, but total dispersion and 
<A NAME="519"></A>annihilation threatened, and Boeotia was in a greater fear than ever- Pelopidas, 
<A NAME="520"></A>leaving his house, when his wife followed him on his way, and with tears 
<A NAME="521"></A>begged him to be careful of his life, made answer, "Private men, my wife, 
<A NAME="522"></A>should be advised to look to themselves, generals to save others." And 
<A NAME="523"></A>when he came to the camp, and found the chief captains disagreeing, he, 
<A NAME="524"></A>first, joined the side of Epaminondas, who advised to fight the enemy; 
<A NAME="525"></A>though Pelopidas himself was not then in office as chief captain of Boeotia, 
<A NAME="526"></A>but in command of the Sacred Band, and trusted as it was fit a man should 
<A NAME="527"></A>be, who had given his country such proofs of his zeal for its freedom. 
<A NAME="528"></A>And so when a battle was agreed on, and they encamped in front of the Spartans 
<A NAME="529"></A>at Leuctra, Pelopidas saw a vision, which much discomposed him. In that 
<A NAME="530"></A>plain lie the bodies of the daughters of one Scedasus, called from the 
<A NAME="531"></A>place Leuctridae, having been buried there after having been ravished by 
<A NAME="532"></A>some Spartan strangers. When this base and lawless deed was done, and their 
<A NAME="533"></A>father could get no satisfaction at Lacedaemon, with bitter imprecations 
<A NAME="534"></A>on the Spartans, he killed himself at his daughters' tombs: and from that 
<A NAME="535"></A>time the prophecies and oracles still warned them to have a great care 
<A NAME="536"></A>of the divine vengeance at Leuctra. Many, however, did not understand the 
<A NAME="537"></A>meaning, being uncertain about the place, because there was a little maritime 
<A NAME="538"></A>town of Laconia called Leuctron, and near Megalopolis in Arcadia a place 
<A NAME="539"></A>of the same name; and the villainy was committed long before this 
<A NAME="540"></A>battle.
<A NAME="541"></A><BR><BR>Now Pelopidas, being asleep in the camp, thought he saw the maidens 
<A NAME="542"></A>weeping about their tombs, and cursing the Spartans, and Scedasus commanding, 
<A NAME="543"></A>if they desired the victory, to sacrifice a virgin with chestnut hair to 
<A NAME="544"></A>his daughters. Pelopidas looked on this as an harsh and impious injunction, 
<A NAME="545"></A>but rose and told it to the prophets and commanders of the army, some of 
<A NAME="546"></A>whom contended that it was fit to obey, and adduced as examples from the 
<A NAME="547"></A>ancients, Menoeceus, son of Creon; Macaria, daughter of Hercules; and from 
<A NAME="548"></A>later times, Pherecydes the philosopher, slain by the Lacedaemonians, and 
<A NAME="549"></A>his skin, as the oracles advised, still kept by their kings. Leonidas, 
<A NAME="550"></A>again, warned by the oracle, did as it were sacrifice himself for the good 
<A NAME="551"></A>of Greece; Themistocles offered human victims to Bacchus Omestes, before 
<A NAME="552"></A>the engagement at Salamis; and success showed their actions to be good. 
<A NAME="553"></A>On the contrary, Agesilaus, going from the same place, and against the 
<A NAME="554"></A>same enemies that Agamemnon did, and being commanded in a dream at Aulis 
<A NAME="555"></A>to sacrifice his daughter, was so weak as to disobey; the consequence of 
<A NAME="556"></A>which was, that his expedition was unsuccessful and inglorious. But some 
<A NAME="557"></A>on the other side urged that such a barbarous and impious obligation could 
<A NAME="558"></A>not be pleasing to any Superior Beings; that typhons and giants did not 
<A NAME="559"></A>preside over the world, but the general father of gods and men; that it 
<A NAME="560"></A>was absurd to imagine any divinities or powers delighted in slaughter and 
<A NAME="561"></A>sacrifices of men; or, if there were such, they were to be neglected as 
<A NAME="562"></A>weak and unable to assist; such unreasonable and cruel desires could only 
<A NAME="563"></A>proceed from, and live in, weak and depraved minds.
<A NAME="564"></A><BR><BR>The commanders thus disputing, and Pelopidas being in a great perplexity, 
<A NAME="565"></A>a mare colt breaking from the herd, ran through the camp, and when she 
<A NAME="566"></A>came to the place where they were stood still; and whilst some admired 
<A NAME="567"></A>her bright chestnut colour, others her mettle, or the strength and fury 
<A NAME="568"></A>of her neighing, Theocritus, the augur, took thought, and cried out to 
<A NAME="569"></A>Pelopidas, "O good friend! look, the sacrifice is come; expect no other 
<A NAME="570"></A>virgin, but use that which the gods have sent thee." With that they took 
<A NAME="571"></A>the colt, and, leading her to the maidens' sepulchres, with the usual solemnity 
<A NAME="572"></A>and prayers, offered her with joy, and spread through the whole army the 
<A NAME="573"></A>account of Pelopidas's dream, and how they had given the required 
<A NAME="574"></A>sacrifice.
<A NAME="575"></A><BR><BR>In the battle, Epaminondas, bending his phalanx to the left, that, 
<A NAME="576"></A>as much as possible, he might divide the right wing, composed of Spartans, 
<A NAME="577"></A>from the other Greeks, and distress Cleombrotus by a fierce charge in column 
<A NAME="578"></A>on that wing, the enemies perceived the design, and began to change their 
<A NAME="579"></A>order, to open and extend their right wing, and, as they far exceeded him 
<A NAME="580"></A>in number, to encompass Epaminondas. But Pelopidas with the three hundred 
<A NAME="581"></A>came rapidly up, before Cleombrotus could extend his line, and close up 
<A NAME="582"></A>his divisions, and so fell upon the Spartans while in disorder; though 
<A NAME="583"></A>the Lacedaemonians, the expertest and most practised soldiers of all mankind, 
<A NAME="584"></A>used to train and accustom themselves to nothing so much as to keep themselves 
<A NAME="585"></A>from confusion upon any change of position, and to follow any leader, or 
<A NAME="586"></A>right-hand man, and form in order, and fight on what part soever dangers 
<A NAME="587"></A>press. In this battle, however, Epaminondas with his phalanx, neglecting 
<A NAME="588"></A>the other Greeks, and charging them alone, and Pelopidas coming up with 
<A NAME="589"></A>such incredible speed and fury, so broke their courage and baffled their 
<A NAME="590"></A>art that there began such a flight and slaughter amongst the Spartans as 
<A NAME="591"></A>was never before known. And so Pelopidas, though in no high office, but 
<A NAME="592"></A>only captain of a small band, got as much reputation by the victory as 
<A NAME="593"></A>Epaminondas, who was general and chief captain of Boeotia.
<A NAME="594"></A><BR><BR>Into Peloponnesus, however, they both advanced together as colleagues 
<A NAME="595"></A>in supreme command, and gained the greater part of the nations there from 
<A NAME="596"></A>the Spartan confederacy; Elis, Argos, all Arcadia, and much of Laconia 
<A NAME="597"></A>itself. It was the dead of winter, and but few of the last days of the 
<A NAME="598"></A>month remained, and, in the beginning of the next, few officers were to 
<A NAME="599"></A>succeed, and whoever failed to deliver up his charge forfeited his head. 
<A NAME="600"></A>Therefore, the other chief captains fearing the law, and to avoid the sharpness 
<A NAME="601"></A>of the winter, advised a retreat. But Pelopidas joined with Epaminondas, 
<A NAME="602"></A>and, encouraging his countrymen, led them against Sparta, and, passing 
<A NAME="603"></A>the Eurotas, took many of the towns, and wasted the country as far as the 
<A NAME="604"></A>sea. This army consisted of seventy thousand Greeks, of which number the 
<A NAME="605"></A>Thebans could not make the twelfth part; but the reputation of the men 
<A NAME="606"></A>made all their allies contented to follow them as leaders, though no articles 
<A NAME="607"></A>to that effect had been made. For, indeed, it seems the first and paramount 
<A NAME="608"></A>law, that he that wants a defender is naturally a subject to him that is 
<A NAME="609"></A>able to defend: as mariners, though in a calm or in the port they grow 
<A NAME="610"></A>insolent, and brave the pilot, yet when a storm comes, and danger is at 
<A NAME="611"></A>hand, they all attend, and put their hopes in him. So the Argives, Eleans, 
<A NAME="612"></A>and Arcadians, in their congresses, would contend with the Thebans for 
<A NAME="613"></A>superiority in command, yet in a battle, or any hazardous undertaking, 
<A NAME="614"></A>of their own will followed their Theban captains. In this expedition they 
<A NAME="615"></A>united all Arcadia into one body, and expelling the Spartans that inhabited 
<A NAME="616"></A>Messenia, they called back the old Messenians, and established them in 
<A NAME="617"></A>Ithome in one body;- and, returning through Cenchreae, they dispersed the 
<A NAME="618"></A>Athenians, who designed to set upon them in the straits, and hinder their 
<A NAME="619"></A>march.
<A NAME="620"></A><BR><BR>For these exploits, all the other Greeks loved their courage and 
<A NAME="621"></A>admired their success; but among their own citizens, envy, still increasing 
<A NAME="622"></A>with their glory, prepared them no pleasing nor agreeable reception. Both 
<A NAME="623"></A>were tried for their lives, because they did not deliver up their command 
<A NAME="624"></A>in the first month, Bucatius, as the law required, but kept it four months 
<A NAME="625"></A>longer, in which time they did these memorable actions in Messenia, Arcadia, 
<A NAME="626"></A>and Laconia. Pelopidas was first tried, and therefore in greatest danger, 
<A NAME="627"></A>but both were acquitted. Epaminondas bore the accusation and trial very 
<A NAME="628"></A>patiently, esteeming it a great and essential part of courage and generosity 
<A NAME="629"></A>not to resent injuries in political life. But Pelopidas, being a man of 
<A NAME="630"></A>a fiercer temper, and stirred on by his friends to revenge the affront, 
<A NAME="631"></A>took the following occasion. Meneclidas, the orator, was one of those that 
<A NAME="632"></A>had met with Melon and Pelopidas at Charon's house; but not receiving equal 
<A NAME="633"></A>honour, and being powerful in his speech, but loose in his manners, and 
<A NAME="634"></A>ill-natured, he abused his natural endowments, even after this trial, to 
<A NAME="635"></A>accuse and calumniate his betters. He excluded Epaminondas from the chief 
<A NAME="636"></A>captaincy, and for a long time kept the upper hand of him, but he was not 
<A NAME="637"></A>powerful enough to bring Pelopidas out of the people's favour, and therefore 
<A NAME="638"></A>endeavoured to raise a quarrel between him and Charon. And since it is 
<A NAME="639"></A>some comfort to the envious to make those men, whom themselves cannot excel, 
<A NAME="640"></A>appear worse than others, he studiously enlarged upon Charon's actions 
<A NAME="641"></A>in his speeches to the people, and made panegyrics on his expeditions and 
<A NAME="642"></A>victories; and, of the victory which the horsemen won at Plataea, before 
<A NAME="643"></A>the battle at Leuctra, under Charon's command, he endeavoured to make the 
<A NAME="644"></A>following sacred memorial. Androcydes, the Cyzicenian, had undertaken to 
<A NAME="645"></A>paint a previous battle for the city, and was at work in Thebes: and when 
<A NAME="646"></A>the revolt began, and the war came on, the Thebans kept the picture that 
<A NAME="647"></A>was then almost finished. This picture Meneclidas persuaded them to dedicate, 
<A NAME="648"></A>inscribed with Charon's name, designing by that means to obscure the glory 
<A NAME="649"></A>of Epaminondas and Pelopidas. This was a ludicrous piece of pretension, 
<A NAME="650"></A>to set a single victory, where only one Gerandas, an obscure Spartan, and 
<A NAME="651"></A>forty more were slain, above such numerous and important battles. This 
<A NAME="652"></A>motion Pelopidas opposed, as contrary to law, alleging that it was not 
<A NAME="653"></A>the custom of the Thebans to honour any single man, but to attribute the 
<A NAME="654"></A>victory to their country; yet in all the contest he extremely commended 
<A NAME="655"></A>Charon, and confined himself to showing Meneclidas to be a troublesome 
<A NAME="656"></A>and envious fellow, asking the Thebans, if they had done nothing that was 
<A NAME="657"></A>excellent insomuch that Meneclidas was severely fined; and he, being unable 
<A NAME="658"></A>to pay, endeavoured afterwards to disturb the government. These things 
<A NAME="659"></A>give us some light into Pelopidas's life.
<A NAME="660"></A><BR><BR>Now when Alexander, the tyrant of Pherae, made open war against 
<A NAME="661"></A>some of the Thessalians, and had designs against all, the cities sent an 
<A NAME="662"></A>embassy to Thebes, to desire succours and a general; and Pelopidas, knowing 
<A NAME="663"></A>that Epaminondas was detained by the Peloponnesian affairs, offered himself 
<A NAME="664"></A>to lead the Thessalians, being unwilling to let his courage and skill lie 
<A NAME="665"></A>idle, and thinking it unfit that Epaminondas should be withdrawn from his 
<A NAME="666"></A>present duties. When he came into Thessaly with his army, he presently 
<A NAME="667"></A>took Larissa, and endeavoured to reclaim Alexander, who submitted, and 
<A NAME="668"></A>bring him, from being a tyrant, to govern gently, and according to law; 
<A NAME="669"></A>but finding him untractable and brutish, and hearing great complaints of 
<A NAME="670"></A>his lust and cruelty, Pelopidas began to be severe, and used him roughly, 
<A NAME="671"></A>insomuch that the tyrant stole away privately with his guard. But Pelopidas, 
<A NAME="672"></A>leaving the Thessalians fearless of the tyrant, and friends amongst themselves, 
<A NAME="673"></A>marched into Macedonia, where Ptolemy was then at war with Alexander the 
<A NAME="674"></A>King of Macedon; both parties having sent for him to hear and determine 
<A NAME="675"></A>their differences, and assist the one that appeared injured. When he came, 
<A NAME="676"></A>he reconciled them, calling back the exiles; and receiving for hostages 
<A NAME="677"></A>Philip the king's brother, and thirty children of the nobles, he brought 
<A NAME="678"></A>them to Thebes; showing the other Greeks how wide a reputation the Thebans 
<A NAME="679"></A>had gained for honesty and courage. This was that Philip who afterwards 
<A NAME="680"></A>endeavoured to enslave the Greeks; then he was a boy, lived with Pammenes 
<A NAME="681"></A>in Thebes; and hence some conjecture that he took Epaminondas's actions 
<A NAME="682"></A>for the rule of his own; and perhaps, indeed, he did take example from 
<A NAME="683"></A>his activity and skill in war, which, however, was but a small portion 
<A NAME="684"></A>of his virtues; of his temperance, justice, generosity, and mildness, in 
<A NAME="685"></A>which he was truly great, Philip enjoyed no share either by nature or 
<A NAME="686"></A>imitation.
<A NAME="687"></A><BR><BR>After this, upon a second complaint of the Thessalians against 
<A NAME="688"></A>Alexander of Pherae, as a disturber of the cities, Pelopidas was joined 
<A NAME="689"></A>with Ismenias, in an embassy to him; but led no forces from Thebes not 
<A NAME="690"></A>expecting any war, and therefore was necessitated to make use of the Thessalians 
<A NAME="691"></A>upon the emergency. At the same time, also, Macedon was in confusion again, 
<A NAME="692"></A>as Ptolemy had murdered the king, and seized the government: but the king's 
<A NAME="693"></A>friends sent for Pelopidas, and he being willing to interpose in the matter, 
<A NAME="694"></A>but having no soldiers of his own, enlisted some mercenaries in that country, 
<A NAME="695"></A>and with them marched against Ptolemy. When they faced one another Ptolemy 
<A NAME="696"></A>corrupted these mercenaries with a sum of money, and persuaded them to 
<A NAME="697"></A>revolt to him; but yet fearing the very name and reputation of Pelopidas, 
<A NAME="698"></A>he came to him as his superior, submitted, begged his pardon, and protested 
<A NAME="699"></A>that he kept the government only for the brothers of the dead king, and 
<A NAME="700"></A>would prove a friend to the friends, and an enemy to the enemies of Thebes; 
<A NAME="701"></A>and, to confirm this, he gave his son, Philoxenus, and fifty of his companions, 
<A NAME="702"></A>for hostages. These Pelopidas sent to Thebes; but he himself, being vexed 
<A NAME="703"></A>at the treachery of the mercenaries, and understanding that most of their 
<A NAME="704"></A>goods, their wives, and children lay at Pharsalus, so that if he could 
<A NAME="705"></A>take them the injury would be sufficiently revenged, got together some 
<A NAME="706"></A>of the Thessalians, and marched to Pharsalus. When he just entered the 
<A NAME="707"></A>city, Alexander, the tyrant, appeared before it with an army; but Pelopidas 
<A NAME="708"></A>and his friends, thinking that he came to clear himself from those crimes 
<A NAME="709"></A>that were laid to his charge, went to him; and though they knew very well 
<A NAME="710"></A>that he was profligate and cruel, yet they imagined that the authority 
<A NAME="711"></A>of Thebes, and their own dignity and reputation, would secure them from 
<A NAME="712"></A>violence. But the tyrant, seeing them come unarmed and alone, seized them, 
<A NAME="713"></A>and made himself master of Pharsalus. Upon this his subjects were much 
<A NAME="714"></A>intimidated, thinking that after so great and so bold an iniquity he would 
<A NAME="715"></A>spare none, but behave himself toward all, and in all matters, as one despairing 
<A NAME="716"></A>of his life.
<A NAME="717"></A><BR><BR>The Thebans, when they heard of this, were very much enraged, and 
<A NAME="718"></A>despatched an army, Epaminondas being then in disgrace, under the command 
<A NAME="719"></A>of other leaders. When the tyrant brought Pelopidas to Pherae, at first 
<A NAME="720"></A>he permitted those that desired it to speak with him, imagining that this 
<A NAME="721"></A>disaster would break his spirit, and make him appear contemptible. But 
<A NAME="722"></A>when Pelopidas advised the complaining Pheraeans to be comforted, as if 
<A NAME="723"></A>the tyrant was now certain in a short time to smart for his injuries, and 
<A NAME="724"></A>sent to tell him, "that it was absurd daily to torment and murder his wretched 
<A NAME="725"></A>innocent subjects, and yet spare him, who, he well knew, if ever he got 
<A NAME="726"></A>his liberty, would be bitterly revenged;" the tyrant, wondering at his 
<A NAME="727"></A>boldness and freedom of speech, replied, "And why is Pelopidas in haste 
<A NAME="728"></A>to die?" He, hearing of it, rejoined, "That you may be the sooner ruined, 
<A NAME="729"></A>being then more hated by the gods than now." From that time he forbade 
<A NAME="730"></A>any to converse with him; but Thebe, the daughter of Jason and wife to 
<A NAME="731"></A>Alexander, hearing from the keepers of the bravery and noble behaviour 
<A NAME="732"></A>of Pelopidas, had a great desire to see and speak with him. Now when she 
<A NAME="733"></A>came into the prison, and, as a woman, could not at once discern his greatness 
<A NAME="734"></A>in his calamity, only judging by the meanness of his attire and general 
<A NAME="735"></A>appearance, that he was used basely and not befitting a man of his reputation, 
<A NAME="736"></A>she wept. Pelopidas, at first not knowing who she was, stood amazed; but 
<A NAME="737"></A>when he understood, saluted her by her father's name- Jason and he having 
<A NAME="738"></A>been friends and familiars- and she saying, "I pity your wife, sir," he 
<A NAME="739"></A>replied, "And I you, that though not in chains, can endure Alexander." 
<A NAME="740"></A>This touched the woman, who already hated Alexander for his cruelty and 
<A NAME="741"></A>injustice, for his general debaucheries, and for his abuse of her youngest 
<A NAME="742"></A>brother. She, therefore, often went to Pelopidas, and, speaking freely 
<A NAME="743"></A>of the indignities she suffered, grew more enraged and more exasperated 
<A NAME="744"></A>against Alexander.
<A NAME="745"></A><BR><BR>The Theban generals that were sent into Thessaly did nothing, but, 
<A NAME="746"></A>being either unskillful or unfortunate, made a dishonourable retreat, for 
<A NAME="747"></A>which the city fined each of them ten thousand drachmas, and sent Epaminondas 
<A NAME="748"></A>with their forces. The Thessalians, inspirited by the fame of this general, 
<A NAME="749"></A>at once began to stir, and the tyrant's affairs were at the verge of destruction; 
<A NAME="750"></A>so great was the fear that possessed his captains and his friends, and 
<A NAME="751"></A>so eager the desire of his subjects to revolt, in hope of his speedy punishment. 
<A NAME="752"></A>But Epaminondas, more solicitous for the safety of Pelopidas than his own 
<A NAME="753"></A>glory, and fearing that if things came to extremity Alexander would grow 
<A NAME="754"></A>desperate, and, like a wild beast, turn and worry him, did not prosecute 
<A NAME="755"></A>the war to the utmost; but, hovering still over him with his army, he so 
<A NAME="756"></A>handled the tyrant as not to leave him any confidence, and yet not to drive 
<A NAME="757"></A>him to despair and fury. He was aware of his savageness, and the little 
<A NAME="758"></A>value he had for right and justice, insomuch that sometimes he buried men 
<A NAME="759"></A>alive, and sometimes dressed them in bears' and boars' skins, and then 
<A NAME="760"></A>baited them with dog, or shot at them for his divertisement. At Meliboea 
<A NAME="761"></A>and Scotussa, two cities, his allies, he called all the inhabitants to 
<A NAME="762"></A>an assembly, and then surrounded them and cut them to pieces with his guards. 
<A NAME="763"></A>He consecrated the spear with which he killed his uncle Polyphron, and, 
<A NAME="764"></A>crowning it with garlands, sacrificed to it as a god, and called it Tychon. 
<A NAME="765"></A>And once seeing a tragedian act Euripides's Troades, he left the theatre; 
<A NAME="766"></A>but sending for the actor, bade him not to be concerned at his departure, 
<A NAME="767"></A>but act as he had been used to do, as it was not in contempt of him that 
<A NAME="768"></A>he departed, but because he was ashamed that his citizens should see him, 
<A NAME="769"></A>who never pitied any man that he murdered, weep at the sufferings of Hecuba 
<A NAME="770"></A>and Andromache. This tyrant, however alarmed at the very name, report, 
<A NAME="771"></A>and appearance of an expedition under the conduct of Epaminondas, 
<A NAME="772"></A>presently-
<A NAME="773"></A><BR><BR>"Dropped like a craven cock his conquered wing." and sent an embassy 
<A NAME="774"></A>to entreat and offer satisfaction. Epaminondas refused to admit such a 
<A NAME="775"></A>man as an ally to the Thebans, but granted him a truce of thirty days, 
<A NAME="776"></A>and Pelopidas and Ismenias being delivered up, returned 
<A NAME="777"></A>home.
<A NAME="778"></A><BR><BR>Now the Thebans, understanding that the Spartans and Athenians 
<A NAME="779"></A>had sent an embassy to the Persians for assistance, themselves, likewise, 
<A NAME="780"></A>sent Pelopidas; an excellent design to increase his glory, no man having 
<A NAME="781"></A>ever before passed through the dominions of the king with greater fame 
<A NAME="782"></A>and reputation. For the glory that he won against the Spartans did not 
<A NAME="783"></A>creep slowly or obscurely; but, after the fame of the first battle at Leuctra 
<A NAME="784"></A>was gone abroad, the report of new victories continually following, exceedingly 
<A NAME="785"></A>increased, and spread his celebrity far and near. Whatever satraps or generals 
<A NAME="786"></A>or commanders he met, he was the object of their wonder and discourse. 
<A NAME="787"></A>"This is the man," they said, "who hath beaten the Lacedaemonians from 
<A NAME="788"></A>sea and land, and confined that Sparta within Taygetus and Eurotas, which, 
<A NAME="789"></A>but a little before, under the conduct of Agesilaus, was entering upon 
<A NAME="790"></A>a war with the great king about Susa and Ecbatana." This pleased Artaxerxes, 
<A NAME="791"></A>and he was the more inclined to show Pelopidas attention and honour, being 
<A NAME="792"></A>desirous to seem reverenced, and attended by the greatest. But when he 
<A NAME="793"></A>saw him and heard his discourse, more solid than the Athenians, and not 
<A NAME="794"></A>so haughty as the Spartans, his regard was heightened, and, truly acting 
<A NAME="795"></A>like a king, he openly showed the respect that he felt for him; and this 
<A NAME="796"></A>the other ambassadors perceived. Of all other Greeks he had been thought 
<A NAME="797"></A>to have done Antalcidas, the Spartan, the greatest honour, by sending him 
<A NAME="798"></A>that garland dipped in an unguent, which he himself had worn at an entertainment. 
<A NAME="799"></A>Indeed, he did not deal so delicately with Pelopidas, but, according to 
<A NAME="800"></A>the custom, gave him the most splendid and considerable presents, and granted 
<A NAME="801"></A>him his desires- that the Grecians should be free, Messenia inhabited, 
<A NAME="802"></A>and the Thebans accounted the king's hereditary friends. With these answers, 
<A NAME="803"></A>but not accepting one of the presents, except what was a pledge of kindness 
<A NAME="804"></A>and good-will, he returned. This behaviour of Pelopidas ruined the other 
<A NAME="805"></A>ambassadors; the Athenians condemned and executed their Timagoras, and, 
<A NAME="806"></A>indeed, if they did it for receiving so many presents from the king, their 
<A NAME="807"></A>sentence was just and good; as he not only took gold and silver, but a 
<A NAME="808"></A>rich bed, and slaves to make it, as if the Greeks were unskillful in that 
<A NAME="809"></A>art; besides eighty cows and herdsmen, professing he needed cows' milk 
<A NAME="810"></A>for some distemper; and, lastly, he was carried in a litter to the seaside, 
<A NAME="811"></A>with a present of four talents for his attendants. But the Athenians, perhaps, 
<A NAME="812"></A>were not so much irritated at his greediness for the presents. For Epicrates 
<A NAME="813"></A>the baggage-carrier not only confessed to the people that he had received 
<A NAME="814"></A>gifts from the king, but made a motion, that instead of nine archons, they 
<A NAME="815"></A>should yearly choose nine poor citizens to be sent ambassadors to the king, 
<A NAME="816"></A>and enriched by his presents, and the people only laughed at the joke. 
<A NAME="817"></A>But they were vexed that the Thebans obtained their desires, never considering 
<A NAME="818"></A>that Pelopidas's fame was more powerful than all their rhetorical discourse, 
<A NAME="819"></A>with a man who still inclined to the victorious in arms. This embassy, 
<A NAME="820"></A>having obtained the restitution of Messenia, and the freedom of the other 
<A NAME="821"></A>Greeks, got Pelopidas a great deal of good-will at his 
<A NAME="822"></A>return.
<A NAME="823"></A><BR><BR>At this time, Alexander the Pheraean falling back to his old nature, 
<A NAME="824"></A>and having seized many of the Thessalian cities, and put garrisons upon 
<A NAME="825"></A>the Achaeans of Phthiotis, and the Magnesians, the cities, hearing that 
<A NAME="826"></A>Pelopidas was returned, sent an embassy to Thebes requesting succours, 
<A NAME="827"></A>and him for their leader. The Thebans willingly granted their desire; and 
<A NAME="828"></A>now when all things were prepared, and the general beginning to march, 
<A NAME="829"></A>the sun was eclipsed, and darkness spread over the city at noonday. Now 
<A NAME="830"></A>when Pelopidas saw them startled at the prodigy, he did not think it fit 
<A NAME="831"></A>to force on men who were afraid and out of heart, nor to hazard seven thousand 
<A NAME="832"></A>of his citizens; and therefore with only three hundred horse volunteers, 
<A NAME="833"></A>set forward himself to Thessaly, much against the will of the augurs and 
<A NAME="834"></A>his fellow-citizens in general, who all imagined this marked portent to 
<A NAME="835"></A>have reference to this great man. But he was heated against Alexander for 
<A NAME="836"></A>the injuries he had received, and hoped likewise, from the discourse which 
<A NAME="837"></A>formerly he had with Thebe, that his family by this time was divided and 
<A NAME="838"></A>in disorder. But the glory of the expedition chiefly excited him; for he 
<A NAME="839"></A>was extremely desirous at this time, when the Lacedaemonians were sending 
<A NAME="840"></A>out military officers to assist Dionysius the Sicilian tyrant, and the 
<A NAME="841"></A>Athenians took Alexander's pay, and honoured him with a brazen statue as 
<A NAME="842"></A>a benefactor, that the Thebans should be seen, alone, of all the Greeks, 
<A NAME="843"></A>undertaking the cause of those who were oppressed by tyrants, and destroying 
<A NAME="844"></A>the violent and illegal forms of government in Greece.
<A NAME="845"></A><BR><BR>When Pelopidas was come to Pharsalus, he formed an army, and presently 
<A NAME="846"></A>marched against Alexander; and Alexander understanding that Pelopidas had 
<A NAME="847"></A>few Thebans with him, and that his own infantry was double the number of 
<A NAME="848"></A>the Thessalians, faced him at Thetidium. Some one told Pelopidas, "The 
<A NAME="849"></A>tyrant meets us with a great army;" "So much the better," he replied, "for 
<A NAME="850"></A>then we shall overcome the more." Between the two armies lay some steep 
<A NAME="851"></A>high hills about Cynoscephalae, which both parties endeavoured to take 
<A NAME="852"></A>by their foot. Pelopidas commanded his horse, which were good and many, 
<A NAME="853"></A>to charge that of the enemies; they routed and pursued them through the 
<A NAME="854"></A>plain. But Alexander meantime took the hills, and charging the Thessalian 
<A NAME="855"></A>foot that came up later, and strove to climb the steep and craggy ascent, 
<A NAME="856"></A>killed the foremost, and the others, much distressed, could do the enemies 
<A NAME="857"></A>no harm. Pelopidas, observing this, sounded a retreat to his horse, and 
<A NAME="858"></A>gave orders that they should charge the enemies that kept their ground; 
<A NAME="859"></A>and he himself, taking his shield, quickly joined those that fought about 
<A NAME="860"></A>the hills, and advancing to the front, filled his men with such courage 
<A NAME="861"></A>and alacrity, that the enemies imagined they came with other spirits and 
<A NAME="862"></A>other bodies to the onset. They stood two or three charges, but finding 
<A NAME="863"></A>these come on stoutly, and the horse, also, returning from the pursuit, 
<A NAME="864"></A>gave ground, and retreated in order. Pelopidas now perceiving, from the 
<A NAME="865"></A>rising ground, that the enemy's army was, though not yet routed, full of 
<A NAME="866"></A>disorder and confusion, stood and looked about for Alexander; and when 
<A NAME="867"></A>he saw him in the right wing, encouraging and ordering his mercenaries, 
<A NAME="868"></A>he could not moderate his anger, but inflamed at the sight, and blindly 
<A NAME="869"></A>following his passion, regardless alike of his own life and his command, 
<A NAME="870"></A>advanced far before his soldiers, crying out and challenging the tyrant 
<A NAME="871"></A>who did not dare to receive him, but retreating, hid himself amongst his 
<A NAME="872"></A>guard. The foremost of the mercenaries that came hand to hand were driven 
<A NAME="873"></A>back by Pelopidas, and some killed; but many at a distance shot through 
<A NAME="874"></A>his armour and wounded him, till the Thessalians, in anxiety for the result, 
<A NAME="875"></A>ran down the hill to his relief, but found him already slain. The horse 
<A NAME="876"></A>came up also, and routed the phalanx, and following the pursuit a great 
<A NAME="877"></A>way filled the whole country with the slain, which were above three 
<A NAME="878"></A>thousand.
<A NAME="879"></A><BR><BR>No one can wonder that the Thebans then present should show great 
<A NAME="880"></A>grief at the death of Pelopidas, calling him their father, deliverer, and 
<A NAME="881"></A>instructor in all that was good and commendable. But the Thessalians and 
<A NAME="882"></A>the allies, outdoing in their public edicts all the just honours that could 
<A NAME="883"></A>be paid to human courage, gave, in their display of feeling, yet stronger 
<A NAME="884"></A>demonstrations of the kindness they had for him. It is stated that none 
<A NAME="885"></A>of the soldiers, when they heard of his death, would put off their armour, 
<A NAME="886"></A>unbridle their horses, or dress their wounds, but still hot and with their 
<A NAME="887"></A>arms on, ran to the corpse, and, as if he had been yet alive and could 
<A NAME="888"></A>see what they did, heaped up spoils about his body. They cut off their 
<A NAME="889"></A>horses' manes and their own hair, many kindled no fire in their tents, 
<A NAME="890"></A>took no supper, and silence and sadness was spread over all the army; as 
<A NAME="891"></A>if they had not gained the greatest and most glorious victory, but were 
<A NAME="892"></A>overcome by the tyrant and enslaved. As soon as it was known in the cities, 
<A NAME="893"></A>the magistrates, youths, children, and priests came out to meet the body, 
<A NAME="894"></A>and brought trophies, crowns, and suits of golden armour; and, when he 
<A NAME="895"></A>was to be interred, the elders of the Thessalians came and begged the Thebans 
<A NAME="896"></A>that they might give the funeral; and one of them said, "Friends, we ask 
<A NAME="897"></A>a favour of you, that will prove both an honour and comfort to us in this 
<A NAME="898"></A>our great misfortune. The Thessalians shall never again wait on the living 
<A NAME="899"></A>Pelopidas, shall never give honours of which he can be sensible, but if 
<A NAME="900"></A>we may have his body, adorn his funeral, and inter him, we shall hope to 
<A NAME="901"></A>show that we esteem his death a greater loss to the Thessalians than to 
<A NAME="902"></A>the Thebans. You have lost only a good general, we both a general and our 
<A NAME="903"></A>liberty. For how shall we dare to desire from you another captain, since 
<A NAME="904"></A>we cannot restore Pelopidas?"
<A NAME="905"></A><BR><BR>The Thebans granted their request, and there was never a more splendid 
<A NAME="906"></A>funeral in the opinion of those who do not think the glory of such solemnities 
<A NAME="907"></A>consists only in gold, ivory, and purple; as Philistus did, who extravagantly 
<A NAME="908"></A>celebrates the funeral of Dionysius, in which his tyranny concluded like 
<A NAME="909"></A>the pompous exit of some great tragedy. Alexander the Great, at the death 
<A NAME="910"></A>of Hephaestion, not only cut off the manes of his horses and his mules, 
<A NAME="911"></A>but took down the battlements from the city walls, that even the towns 
<A NAME="912"></A>might seem mourners, and instead of their former beauteous appearance, 
<A NAME="913"></A>look bald at his funeral. But such honours, being commanded and forced 
<A NAME="914"></A>from the mourners, attended with feelings of jealousy towards those who 
<A NAME="915"></A>received them, and of hatred towards those who exacted them, were no testimonies 
<A NAME="916"></A>of love and respect, but of the barbaric pride, luxury, and insolence of 
<A NAME="917"></A>those who lavished their wealth in these vain and undesirable displays. 
<A NAME="918"></A>But that a man of common rank, dying in a strange country, neither his 
<A NAME="919"></A>wife, children, nor kinsmen present, none either asking or compelling it, 
<A NAME="920"></A>should be attended, buried, and crowned by so many cities that strove to 
<A NAME="921"></A>exceed one another in the demonstrations of their love, seems to be the 
<A NAME="922"></A>sum and completion of happy fortune. For the death of happy men is not, 
<A NAME="923"></A>as Aesop observes, most grievous, but most blessed, since it secures their 
<A NAME="924"></A>felicity, and puts it out of fortune's power. And that Spartan advised 
<A NAME="925"></A>well, who, embracing Diagoras, that had himself been crowned in the Olympic 
<A NAME="926"></A>Games, and saw his sons and grandchildren victors, said, "Die, Diagoras, 
<A NAME="927"></A>for thou canst not be a god." And yet who would compare all the victories 
<A NAME="928"></A>in the Pythian and Olympian Games put together with one of those enterprises 
<A NAME="929"></A>of Pelopidas, of which he successfully performed so many? Having spent 
<A NAME="930"></A>his life in brave and glorious actions, he died at last in the chief command, 
<A NAME="931"></A>for the thirteenth time, of the Boeotians, fighting bravely and in the 
<A NAME="932"></A>act of slaying a tyrant, in defence of the liberty of the 
<A NAME="933"></A>Thessalians.
<A NAME="934"></A><BR><BR>His death, as it brought grief, so likewise it produced advantage 
<A NAME="935"></A>to the allies; for the Thebans, as soon as they heard of his fall, delayed 
<A NAME="936"></A>not their revenge, but presently sent seven thousand foot and seven hundred 
<A NAME="937"></A>horse, under the command of Malcitas and Diogiton. And they, finding Alexander 
<A NAME="938"></A>weak and without forces, compelled him to restore the cities he had taken, 
<A NAME="939"></A>to withdraw his garrisons from the Magnesians and Achaeans of Phthiotis, 
<A NAME="940"></A>and swear to assist the Thebans against whatsoever enemies they should 
<A NAME="941"></A>require. This contented the Thebans, but punishment overtook the tyrant 
<A NAME="942"></A>for his wickedness, and the death of Pelopidas was revenged by Heaven in 
<A NAME="943"></A>the following manner. Pelopidas, as I have already mentioned, had taught 
<A NAME="944"></A>his wife Thebe not to fear the outward splendour and show of the tyrant's 
<A NAME="945"></A>defences, since she was admitted within them. She, of herself, too, dreaded 
<A NAME="946"></A>his inconstancy, and hated his cruelty; and therefore, conspiring with 
<A NAME="947"></A>her three brothers, Tisiphonus, Pytholaus, and Lycophron, made the following 
<A NAME="948"></A>attempt upon him. All other apartments were full of the tyrant's night 
<A NAME="949"></A>guards, but their bed-chamber was an upper room, and before the door lay 
<A NAME="950"></A>a chained dog to guard it, which would fly at all but the tyrant and his 
<A NAME="951"></A>wife and one servant that fed him. When Thebe, therefore, designed to kill 
<A NAME="952"></A>her husband, she hid her brothers all day in a room hard by, and she, going 
<A NAME="953"></A>in alone, according to her usual custom, to Alexander, who was asleep already, 
<A NAME="954"></A>in a little time came out again, and commanded the servant to lead away 
<A NAME="955"></A>the dog, for Alexander wished to rest quietly. She covered the stairs with 
<A NAME="956"></A>wool, that the young men might make no noise as they came up; and then, 
<A NAME="957"></A>bringing up her brothers with their weapons, and leaving them at the chamber 
<A NAME="958"></A>door, she went in, and brought away the tyrant's sword that hung over his 
<A NAME="959"></A>head, and showed it them for confirmation that he was fast asleep. The 
<A NAME="960"></A>young men appearing fearful, and unwilling to do the murder, she chid them, 
<A NAME="961"></A>and angrily vowed she would wake Alexander and discover the conspiracy; 
<A NAME="962"></A>and so, with a lamp in her hand, she conducted them in, they being both 
<A NAME="963"></A>ashamed and afraid, and brought them to the bed; when one of them caught 
<A NAME="964"></A>him by the feet, the other pulled him backwards by the hair, and the third 
<A NAME="965"></A>ran him through. The death was more speedy, perhaps, than was fit; but, 
<A NAME="966"></A>in that he was the first tyrant that was killed by the contrivance of his 
<A NAME="967"></A>wife, and as his corpse was abused, thrown out, and trodden under foot 
<A NAME="968"></A>by the Pheraeans, he seems to have suffered what his villainies 
<A NAME="969"></A>deserved.
