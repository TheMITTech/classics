<A NAME="2"></A><BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Having thus finished the lives of Lycurgus and Numa, we shall now, though 
<A NAME="11"></A>the work be difficult, put together their points of difference as they 
<A NAME="12"></A>lie here before our view. Their points of likeness are obvious; their moderation, 
<A NAME="13"></A>their religion, their capacity of government and discipline, their both 
<A NAME="14"></A>deriving their laws and constitutions from the gods. Yet in their common 
<A NAME="15"></A>glories there are circumstances of diversity; for first Numa accepted and 
<A NAME="16"></A>Lycurgus resigned a kingdom; Numa received without desiring it, Lycurgus 
<A NAME="17"></A>had it and gave it up; the one from a private person and a stranger was 
<A NAME="18"></A>raised by others to be their king; the other from the condition of a prince 
<A NAME="19"></A>voluntarily descended to the state of privacy. It was glorious to acquire 
<A NAME="20"></A>a throne by justice, yet more glorious to prefer justice before a throne; 
<A NAME="21"></A>the same virtue which made the one appear worthy of regal power exalted 
<A NAME="22"></A>the other to the disregard of it. Lastly, as the musicians tune their harps, 
<A NAME="23"></A>so the one let down the high-flown spirits of the people at Rome to a lower 
<A NAME="24"></A>key, as the other screwed them up at Sparta to a higher note, when they 
<A NAME="25"></A>were sunken low by dissoluteness and riot. The harder task was that of 
<A NAME="26"></A>Lycurgus; for it was not so much his business to persuade his citizens 
<A NAME="27"></A>to put off their armour or ungird their swords, as to cast away their gold 
<A NAME="28"></A>or silver, and abandon costly furniture and rich tables; nor was it necessary 
<A NAME="29"></A>to preach to them, that, laying aside their arms, they should observe the 
<A NAME="30"></A>festivals, and sacrifice to the gods, but rather, that, giving up feasting 
<A NAME="31"></A>and drinking, they should employ their time in laborious and martial exercises; 
<A NAME="32"></A>so that while the one effected all by persuasions and his people's love 
<A NAME="33"></A>for him, the other, with danger and hazard of his person, scarcely in the 
<A NAME="34"></A>end succeeded. Numa's muse was a gentle and loving inspiration, fitting 
<A NAME="35"></A>him well to turn and soothe his people into peace and justice out of their 
<A NAME="36"></A>violent and fiery tempers; whereas, if we must admit the treatment of the 
<A NAME="37"></A>Helots to be a part of Lycurgus's legislation, a most cruel and iniquitous 
<A NAME="38"></A>proceeding, we must own that Numa was by a great deal the more humane and 
<A NAME="39"></A>Greek-like legislator, granting even to actual slaves a licence to sit 
<A NAME="40"></A>at meat with their masters at the feast of Saturn, that they also might 
<A NAME="41"></A>have some taste and relish of the sweets of liberty. For this custom, too, 
<A NAME="42"></A>is ascribed to Numa, whose wish was, they conceive, to give a place in 
<A NAME="43"></A>the enjoyment of the yearly fruits of the soil to those who had helped 
<A NAME="44"></A>to produce them. Others will have it to be in remembrance of the age of 
<A NAME="45"></A>Saturn, when there was no distinction between master and slave, but all 
<A NAME="46"></A>lived as brothers and as equals in a condition of equality.
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR>In general, it seems that both aimed at the same design and intent, 
<A NAME="48"></A>which was to bring their people to moderation and frugality; but of other 
<A NAME="49"></A>virtues, the one set his affection most on fortitude, and the other on 
<A NAME="50"></A>justice; unless we will attribute their different ways to the different 
<A NAME="51"></A>habits and temperaments which they had to work upon by their enactments; 
<A NAME="52"></A>for Numa did not out of cowardice or fear affect peace, but because he 
<A NAME="53"></A>would not be guilty of injustice; nor did Lycurgus promote a spirit of 
<A NAME="54"></A>war in his people that they might do injustice to others, but that they 
<A NAME="55"></A>might protect themselves by it.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR>In bringing the habits they formed in their people to a just and 
<A NAME="57"></A>happy mean, mitigating them where they exceeded, and strengthening them 
<A NAME="58"></A>where they were deficient, both were compelled to make great innovations. 
<A NAME="59"></A>The frame of government which Numa formed was democratic and popular to 
<A NAME="60"></A>the last extreme, goldsmiths and flute-players and shoemakers constituting 
<A NAME="61"></A>his promiscuous, many-coloured commonalty. Lycurgus was rigid and aristocratical, 
<A NAME="62"></A>banishing all the base and mechanic arts to the company of servants and 
<A NAME="63"></A>strangers, and allowing the true citizens no implements but the spear and 
<A NAME="64"></A>shield, the trade of war only, and the service of Mars, and no other knowledge 
<A NAME="65"></A>or study, but that of obedience to their commanding officers, and victory 
<A NAME="66"></A>over their enemies. Every sort of money-making was forbid them as freemen; 
<A NAME="67"></A>and to make them thoroughly so and keep them so through their whole lives, 
<A NAME="68"></A>every conceivable concern with money was handed over, with the cooking 
<A NAME="69"></A>and the waiting at table, to slaves and helots. But Numa made none of these 
<A NAME="70"></A>distinctions; he only suppressed military rapacity, allowing free scope 
<A NAME="71"></A>to every other means of obtaining wealth; nor did he endeavour to do away 
<A NAME="72"></A>with inequality in this respect, but permitted riches to be amassed to 
<A NAME="73"></A>any extent, and paid no attention to the gradual and continual augmentation 
<A NAME="74"></A>and influx of poverty; which it was his business at the outset, whilst 
<A NAME="75"></A>there was no great disparity in the estates of men, and whilst people still 
<A NAME="76"></A>lived much in one manner, to obviate, as Lycurgus did, and take measures 
<A NAME="77"></A>of precaution against the mischiefs of avarice, mischiefs not of small 
<A NAME="78"></A>importance, but the real seed and first beginning of all the great and 
<A NAME="79"></A>extensive evils of after-times. The re-division of estates, Lycurgus is 
<A NAME="80"></A>not, it seems to me, to be blamed for making, nor Numa for omitting; this 
<A NAME="81"></A>equality was the basis and foundation of the one commonwealth; but at Rome, 
<A NAME="82"></A>where the lands had been lately divided, there was nothing to urge any 
<A NAME="83"></A>re-division or any disturbance of the first arrangement, which was probably 
<A NAME="84"></A>still in existence.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>With respect to wives and children, and that community which both, 
<A NAME="86"></A>with a sound policy, appointed, to prevent all jealousy, their methods, 
<A NAME="87"></A>however were different. For when a Roman thought himself to have a sufficient 
<A NAME="88"></A>number of children, in case his neighbour who had none should come and 
<A NAME="89"></A>request his wife of him, he had a lawful power to give her up to him who 
<A NAME="90"></A>desired her, either for a certain time, or for good. The Lacedaemonian 
<A NAME="91"></A>husband, on the other hand, might allow the use of his wife to any other 
<A NAME="92"></A>that desired to have children by her, and yet still keep her in his house, 
<A NAME="93"></A>the original marriage obligation still subsisting as at first. Nay, many 
<A NAME="94"></A>husbands, as we have said, would invite men whom they thought likely to 
<A NAME="95"></A>procure them fine and good-looking children into their houses. What is 
<A NAME="96"></A>the difference, then, between the two customs? Shall we say that the Lacedaemonian 
<A NAME="97"></A>system is one of an extreme and entire unconcern about their wives, and 
<A NAME="98"></A>would cause most people endless disquiet and annoyance with pangs and jealousies? 
<A NAME="99"></A>the Roman course wears an air of a more delicate acquiescence, draws the 
<A NAME="100"></A>veil of a new contract over the change, and concedes the general insupportableness 
<A NAME="101"></A>of mere community? Numa's directions, too, for the care of young women, 
<A NAME="102"></A>are better adapted to the female sex and to propriety; Lycurgus's are altogether 
<A NAME="103"></A>unreserved and unfeminine, and have given a great handle to the poets, 
<A NAME="104"></A>who call them (Ibycus, for example) Phoenomerides, bare-thighed; and give 
<A NAME="105"></A>them the character (as does Euripides) of being wild after 
<A NAME="106"></A>husbands-
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR>"These with the young men from the house go 
<A NAME="108"></A>out,
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>With thighs that show, and robes that fly about." For in fact the skirts 
<A NAME="110"></A>of the frock worn by unmarried girls were not sewn together at the lower 
<A NAME="111"></A>part, but used to fly back and show the whole thigh bare as they walked. 
<A NAME="112"></A>The thing is most distinctly given by Sophocles-
<A NAME="113"></A><BR><BR>"-She, also, the young maid,
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>Whose frock, no robe yet o'er it laid,
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>Folding back, leaves her bare thigh free,
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>Hermione." And so their women, it is said, were bold and masculine, 
<A NAME="117"></A>overbearing to their husbands in the first place, absolute mistresses in 
<A NAME="118"></A>their houses, giving their opinions about public matters freely, and speaking 
<A NAME="119"></A>openly even on the most important subjects. But the matrons, under the 
<A NAME="120"></A>government of Numa, still indeed received from their husbands all that 
<A NAME="121"></A>high respect and honour which had been paid them under Romulus as a sort 
<A NAME="122"></A>of atonement for the violence done to them; nevertheless, great modesty 
<A NAME="123"></A>was enjoined upon them; all busy intermeddling forbidden, sobriety insisted 
<A NAME="124"></A>on, and silence made habitual. Wine they were not to touch at all, nor 
<A NAME="125"></A>to speak, except in their husband's company, even on the most ordinary 
<A NAME="126"></A>subjects. So that once when a woman had the confidence to plead her own 
<A NAME="127"></A>cause in a court of judicature, the senate, it is said, sent to inquire 
<A NAME="128"></A>of the oracle what the prodigy did portend; and, indeed, their general 
<A NAME="129"></A>good behaviour and submissiveness is justly proved by the record of those 
<A NAME="130"></A>that were otherwise; for as the Greek historians record in their annals 
<A NAME="131"></A>the names of those who first unsheathed the sword of civil war, or murdered 
<A NAME="132"></A>their brothers, or were parricides, or killed their mothers, so the Roman 
<A NAME="133"></A>writers report it as the first example, that Spurius Carvilius divorced 
<A NAME="134"></A>his wife, being a case that never before happened, in the space of two 
<A NAME="135"></A>hundred and thirty years from the foundation of the city; and that one 
<A NAME="136"></A>Thalaea, the wife of Pinarius, had a quarrel (the first instance of the 
<A NAME="137"></A>kind) with her mother-in-law, Gegania, in the reign of Tarquinius Superbus; 
<A NAME="138"></A>so successful was the legislator in securing order and good conduct in 
<A NAME="139"></A>the marriage relation. Their respective regulations for marrying the young 
<A NAME="140"></A>women are in accordance with those for their education. Lycurgus made them 
<A NAME="141"></A>brides when they were of full age and inclination for it. Intercourse, 
<A NAME="142"></A>where nature was thus consulted, would produce, he thought, love and tenderness, 
<A NAME="143"></A>instead of the dislike and fear attending an unnatural compulsion; and 
<A NAME="144"></A>their bodies, also, would be better able to bear the trials of breeding 
<A NAME="145"></A>and of bearing children, in his judgment the one end of 
<A NAME="146"></A>marriage.
<A NAME="147"></A><BR><BR>The Romans, on the other hand, gave their daughters in marriage 
<A NAME="148"></A>as early as twelve years old, or even under; thus the thought their bodies 
<A NAME="149"></A>alike and minds would be delivered to the future husband pure and undefiled. 
<A NAME="150"></A>The way of Lycurgus seems the more natural with a view to the birth of 
<A NAME="151"></A>children; the other, looking to a life to be spent together, is more moral. 
<A NAME="152"></A>However, the rules which Lycurgus drew up for superintendence of children, 
<A NAME="153"></A>their collection into companies, their discipline and association, as also 
<A NAME="154"></A>his exact regulations for their meals, exercises, and sports, argue Numa 
<A NAME="155"></A>no more than an ordinary lawgiver. Numa left the whole matter simply to 
<A NAME="156"></A>be decided by the parent's wishes or necessities; he might, if he pleased, 
<A NAME="157"></A>make his son a husbandman or carpenter, coppersmith or musician; as if 
<A NAME="158"></A>it were of no importance for them to be directed and trained up from the 
<A NAME="159"></A>beginning to one and the same common end, or as though it would do for 
<A NAME="160"></A>them to be like passengers on shipboard, brought thither each for his own 
<A NAME="161"></A>ends and by his own choice, uniting to act for the common good only in 
<A NAME="162"></A>time of danger upon occasion of their private fears, in general looking 
<A NAME="163"></A>simply to their own interest.
<A NAME="164"></A><BR><BR>We may forbear, indeed, to blame common legislators, who may be 
<A NAME="165"></A>deficient in power or knowledge. But when a wise man like Numa had received 
<A NAME="166"></A>the sovereignty over a new and docile people, was there anything that would 
<A NAME="167"></A>better deserve his attention than the education of children, and the training 
<A NAME="168"></A>up of the young, not to contrariety and discordance of character, but to 
<A NAME="169"></A>the unity of the common model of virtue, to which from their cradle they 
<A NAME="170"></A>should have been formed and moulded? One benefit among many that Lycurgus 
<A NAME="171"></A>obtained by his course was the permanence which it secured to his laws. 
<A NAME="172"></A>The obligation of oaths to preserve them would have availed but little, 
<A NAME="173"></A>if he had not, by discipline and education, infused them into the children's 
<A NAME="174"></A>characters, and imbued their whole early life with a love of his government. 
<A NAME="175"></A>The result was that the main points and fundamentals of his legislation 
<A NAME="176"></A>continued for above five hundred years, like some deep and thoroughly ingrained 
<A NAME="177"></A>tincture, retaining their hold upon the nation. But Numa's whole design 
<A NAME="178"></A>and aim, the continuance of peace and goodwill, on his death vanished with 
<A NAME="179"></A>him; no sooner did he expire his last breath than the gates of Janus's 
<A NAME="180"></A>temple flew wide open, and, as if war had, indeed, been kept and caged 
<A NAME="181"></A>up within those walls, it rushed forth to fill all Italy with blood and 
<A NAME="182"></A>slaughter; and thus that best and justest fabric of things was of no long 
<A NAME="183"></A>continuance, because it wanted that cement which should have kept all together, 
<A NAME="184"></A>education. What, then, some may say, has not Rome been advanced and bettered 
<A NAME="185"></A>by her wars? A question that will need a long answer, if it is to be one 
<A NAME="186"></A>to satisfy men who take the better to consist in riches, luxury, and dominion, 
<A NAME="187"></A>rather than in security, gentleness, and that independence which is accompanied 
<A NAME="188"></A>by justice. However, it makes much for Lycurgus, that, after the Romans 
<A NAME="189"></A>had deserted the doctrine and discipline of Numa, their empire grew and 
<A NAME="190"></A>their power increased so much; whereas so soon as the Lacedaemonians fell 
<A NAME="191"></A>from the institutions of Lycurgus, they sank from the highest to the lowest 
<A NAME="192"></A>state, and, after forfeiting their supremacy over the rest of Greece, were 
<A NAME="193"></A>themselves in danger of absolute extirpation. Thus much, meantime, was 
<A NAME="194"></A>peculiarly signal and almost divine in the circumstances of Numa, that 
<A NAME="195"></A>he was an alien, and yet courted to come and accept a kingdom, the frame 
<A NAME="196"></A>of which though he entirely altered, yet he performed it by mere persuasion, 
<A NAME="197"></A>and ruled a city that as yet had scarce become one city, without recurring 
<A NAME="198"></A>to arms or any violence (such as Lycurgus used, supporting himself by the 
<A NAME="199"></A>aid of the nobler citizens against the commonalty), but, by mere force 
<A NAME="200"></A>of wisdom and justice, established union and harmony amongst 
<A NAME="201"></A>all.
