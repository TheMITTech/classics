<A NAME="2"></A>
<BR>(legendary, died 78 B.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>LUCIUS Cornelius Sylla was descended of a patrician or noble family. Of 
<A NAME="11"></A>his ancestors, Rufinus, it is said, had been consul, and incurred a disgrace 
<A NAME="12"></A>more signal than his distinction. For being found possessed of more than 
<A NAME="13"></A>ten pounds of silver plate, contrary to the law, he was for this reason 
<A NAME="14"></A>put out of the senate. His posterity continued ever after in obscurity, 
<A NAME="15"></A>nor had Sylla himself any opulent parentage. In his younger days he lived 
<A NAME="16"></A>in hired lodgings, at a low rate, which in aftertimes was adduced against 
<A NAME="17"></A>him as proof that he had been fortunate above his quality. When he was 
<A NAME="18"></A>boasting and magnifying himself for his exploits in Libya, a person of 
<A NAME="19"></A>noble station made answer, "And how can you be an honest man, who, since 
<A NAME="20"></A>the death of a father who left you nothing, have become so rich?" The time 
<A NAME="21"></A>in which he lived was no longer an age of pure and upright manners, but 
<A NAME="22"></A>had already declined, and yielded to the appetite for riches and luxury; 
<A NAME="23"></A>yet still, in the general opinion, they who deserted the hereditary poverty 
<A NAME="24"></A>of their family were as much blamed as those who had run out a fair patrimonial 
<A NAME="25"></A>estate. And afterwards, when he had seized the power into his hands, and 
<A NAME="26"></A>was putting many to death, a freedman, suspected of having concealed one 
<A NAME="27"></A>of the proscribed, and for that reason sentenced to be thrown down the 
<A NAME="28"></A>Tarpeian rock, in a reproachful way recounted how they had lived long together 
<A NAME="29"></A>under the same roof, himself for the upper rooms paying two thousand sesterces, 
<A NAME="30"></A>and Sylla for the lower three thousand; so that the difference between 
<A NAME="31"></A>their fortunes then was no more than one thousand sesterces, equivalent 
<A NAME="32"></A>in Attic coin to two hundred and fifty drachmas. And thus much of his early 
<A NAME="33"></A>fortune.
<A NAME="34"></A><BR><BR>His general personal appearance may be known by his statues; only 
<A NAME="35"></A>his blue, eyes, of themselves extremely keen and glaring, were rendered 
<A NAME="36"></A>all the more forbidding and terrible by the complexion of his face, in 
<A NAME="37"></A>which white was mixed with rough blotches of fiery red. Hence, it is said, 
<A NAME="38"></A>he was surnamed Sylla, and in allusion to it one of the scurrilous jesters 
<A NAME="39"></A>at Athens made the verse upon him-
<A NAME="40"></A><BR><BR>"Sylla is a mulberry sprinkled o'er with meal." Nor is it out of 
<A NAME="41"></A>place to make use of marks of character like these, in the case of one 
<A NAME="42"></A>who was by nature so addicted to raillery, that in his youthful obscure 
<A NAME="43"></A>years he would converse freely with players and professed jesters, and 
<A NAME="44"></A>join them in all their low pleasures. And when supreme master of all, he 
<A NAME="45"></A>was often wont to muster together the most impudent players and stage-followers 
<A NAME="46"></A>of the town, and to drink and bandy jests with them without regard to his 
<A NAME="47"></A>age or the dignity of his place, and to the prejudice of important affairs 
<A NAME="48"></A>that required his attention. When he was once at table, it was not in Sylla's 
<A NAME="49"></A>nature to admit of anything that was serious, and whereas at other times 
<A NAME="50"></A>he was a man of business and austere of countenance, he underwent all of 
<A NAME="51"></A>a sudden, at his first entrance upon wine and good-fellowship, a total 
<A NAME="52"></A>revolution, and was gentle and tractable with common singers and dancers, 
<A NAME="53"></A>and ready to oblige any one that spoke with him. It seems to have been 
<A NAME="54"></A>a sort of diseased result of this laxity that he was so prone to amorous 
<A NAME="55"></A>pleasures, and yielded without resistance to any temptation of voluptuousness, 
<A NAME="56"></A>from which even in his old age he could not refrain. He had a long attachment 
<A NAME="57"></A>for Metrobius, a player. In his first amours, it happened that he made 
<A NAME="58"></A>court to a common but rich lady, Nicopolis by name, and what by the air 
<A NAME="59"></A>of his youth, and what by long intimacy, won so far on her affections, 
<A NAME="60"></A>that she rather than he was the lover, and at her death she bequeathed 
<A NAME="61"></A>him her whole property. He likewise inherited the estate of a step-mother 
<A NAME="62"></A>who loved him as her own son. By these means he had pretty well advanced 
<A NAME="63"></A>his fortunes.
<A NAME="64"></A><BR><BR>He was chosen quaestor to Marius in his first consulship, and set 
<A NAME="65"></A>sail with him for Libya, to war upon Jugurtha. Here, in general, he gained 
<A NAME="66"></A>approbation; and more especially, by closing in dexterously with an accidental 
<A NAME="67"></A>occasion, made a friend of Bocchus, King of Numidia. He hospitably entertained 
<A NAME="68"></A>the king's ambassadors on their escape from some Numidian robbers, and 
<A NAME="69"></A>after showing them much kindness, sent them on their journey with presents, 
<A NAME="70"></A>and an escort to protect them. Bocchus had long hated and dreaded his son-in-law, 
<A NAME="71"></A>Jugurtha, who had now been worsted in the field and had fled to him for 
<A NAME="72"></A>shelter; and it so happened he was at this time entertaining a design to 
<A NAME="73"></A>betray him. He accordingly invited Sylla to come to him, wishing the seizure 
<A NAME="74"></A>and surrender of Jugurtha to be effected rather through him, than directly 
<A NAME="75"></A>by himself. Sylla, when he had communicated the business to Marius, and 
<A NAME="76"></A>received from him a small detachment, voluntarily put himself into this 
<A NAME="77"></A>imminent danger; and confiding in a barbarian, who had been unfaithful 
<A NAME="78"></A>to his own relations, to apprehend another man's person, made surrender 
<A NAME="79"></A>of his own. Bocchus, having both of them now in his power, was necessitated 
<A NAME="80"></A>to betray one or other, and after long debate with himself, at last resolved 
<A NAME="81"></A>on his first design, and gave up Jugurtha into the hands of 
<A NAME="82"></A>Sylla.
<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR>For this Marius triumphed, but the glory of the enterprise, which 
<A NAME="84"></A>through people's envy of Marius was ascribed to Sylla, secretly grieved 
<A NAME="85"></A>him. And the truth is, Sylla himself was by nature vainglorious, and this 
<A NAME="86"></A>being the first time that from a low and private condition he had risen 
<A NAME="87"></A>to esteem amongst the citizens and tasted of honour, his appetite for distinction 
<A NAME="88"></A>carried him to such a pitch of ostentation, that he had a representation 
<A NAME="89"></A>of this action engraved on a signet ring, which he carried about with him, 
<A NAME="90"></A>and made use of ever after. The impress was Bocchus delivering, and Sylla 
<A NAME="91"></A>receiving, Jugurtha. This touched Marius to the quick; however, judging 
<A NAME="92"></A>Sylla to be beneath his rivalry, he made use of him as lieutenant, in his 
<A NAME="93"></A>second consulship, and in his third as tribune; and many considerable services 
<A NAME="94"></A>were effected by his means. When acting as lieutenant he took Copillus, 
<A NAME="95"></A>chief of the Tectosages, prisoner, and compelled the Marsians, a great 
<A NAME="96"></A>and populous nation, to become friends and confederates of the 
<A NAME="97"></A>Romans.
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR>Henceforward, however, Sylla, perceiving that Marius bore a jealous 
<A NAME="99"></A>eye over him, and would no longer afford him opportunities of action, but 
<A NAME="100"></A>rather opposed his advance, attached himself to Catulus, Marius's colleague, 
<A NAME="101"></A>a worthy man, but not energetic enough as a general. And under this commander, 
<A NAME="102"></A>who intrusted him with the highest and most important commissions, he rose 
<A NAME="103"></A>at once to reputation and to power. He subdued by arms most part of the 
<A NAME="104"></A>Alpine barbarians; and when there was a scarcity in the armies, he took 
<A NAME="105"></A>that care upon himself and brought in such a store of provisions as not 
<A NAME="106"></A>only to furnish the soldiers of Catulus with abundance, but likewise to 
<A NAME="107"></A>supply Marius. This, as he writes himself, wounded Marius to the very heart. 
<A NAME="108"></A>So slight and childish were the first occasions and motives of that enmity 
<A NAME="109"></A>between them, which, passing afterwards through a long course of civil 
<A NAME="110"></A>bloodshed and incurable divisions to find its end in tyranny, and the confusion 
<A NAME="111"></A>of the whole state, proved Euripides to have been truly wise and thoroughly 
<A NAME="112"></A>acquainted with the causes of disorders in the body politic, when he forewarned 
<A NAME="113"></A>all men to beware of Ambition, as of all the higher Powers the most destructive 
<A NAME="114"></A>and pernicious to her votaries.
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR>Sylla, by this time thinking that the reputation of his arms abroad 
<A NAME="116"></A>was sufficient to entitle him to a part in the civil administration, betook 
<A NAME="117"></A>himself immediately from the camp to the assembly, and offered himself 
<A NAME="118"></A>as a candidate for a praetorship, but failed. The fault of this disappointment 
<A NAME="119"></A>he wholly ascribes to the populace, who, knowing his intimacy with King 
<A NAME="120"></A>Bocchus, and for that reason expecting, that if he was made aedile before 
<A NAME="121"></A>his praetorship, he would then show them magnificent hunting-shows and 
<A NAME="122"></A>combats between Libyan wild beasts, chose other praetors, on purpose to 
<A NAME="123"></A>force him into the aedileship. The vanity of this pretext is sufficiently 
<A NAME="124"></A>disproved by matter-of-fact. For the year following, partly by flatteries 
<A NAME="125"></A>to the people, and partly by money, he got himself elected praetor. Accordingly, 
<A NAME="126"></A>once while he was in office, on his angrily telling Caesar that he should 
<A NAME="127"></A>make use of his authority against him, Caesar answered him with a smile, 
<A NAME="128"></A>"You do well to call it your own, as you bought it." At the end of his 
<A NAME="129"></A>praetorship he was sent over into Cappadocia, under the pretence of reestablishing 
<A NAME="130"></A>Ariobarzanes in his kingdom, but in reality to keep in check the restless 
<A NAME="131"></A>movements of Mithridates, who was gradually procuring himself as vast a 
<A NAME="132"></A>new acquired power and dominion as was that of his ancient inheritance. 
<A NAME="133"></A>He carried over with him no great forces of his own, but making use of 
<A NAME="134"></A>the cheerful aid of the confederates, succeeded, with considerable slaughter 
<A NAME="135"></A>of the Cappadocians, and yet greater of the Armenian succours, in expelling 
<A NAME="136"></A>Gordius and establishing Ariobarzanes as king.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR><BR>During his stay on the banks of the Euphrates, there came to him 
<A NAME="138"></A>Orobazus, a Parthian, ambassador from King Arsaces, as yet there having 
<A NAME="139"></A>been no correspondence between the two nations. And this also we may lay 
<A NAME="140"></A>to the account of Sylla's felicity, that he should be the first Roman to 
<A NAME="141"></A>whom the Parthians made address for alliance and friendship. At the time 
<A NAME="142"></A>of which reception, the story is, that, having ordered three chairs of 
<A NAME="143"></A>state to be set, one for Ariobarzanes, one for Orobazus, and a third for 
<A NAME="144"></A>himself, he placed himself in the middle, and so gave audience. For this 
<A NAME="145"></A>the King of Parthia afterwards put Orobazus to death. Some people commended 
<A NAME="146"></A>Sylla for his lofty carriage towards the barbarians; others again accused 
<A NAME="147"></A>him of arrogance and unseasonable display. It is reported that a certain 
<A NAME="148"></A>Chaldaean, of Orobazus's retinue, looking Sylla wistfully in the face, 
<A NAME="149"></A>and observing carefully the motions of his mind and body, and forming a 
<A NAME="150"></A>judgment of his nature, according to the rules of his art, said that it 
<A NAME="151"></A>was impossible for him not to become the greatest of men; it was rather 
<A NAME="152"></A>a wonder how he could even then abstain from being head of 
<A NAME="153"></A>all.
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR>At his return, Censorinus impeached him of extortion, for having 
<A NAME="155"></A>exacted a vast sum of money from a well-affected and associate kingdom. 
<A NAME="156"></A>However, Censorinus did not appear at the trial, but dropped his accusation. 
<A NAME="157"></A>His quarrel, meantime, with Marius began to break out afresh, receiving 
<A NAME="158"></A>new material from the ambition of Bocchus, who, to please the people of 
<A NAME="159"></A>Rome, and gratify Sylla, set up in the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus images 
<A NAME="160"></A>bearing trophies, and a representation in gold of the surrender of Jugurtha 
<A NAME="161"></A>to Sylla. When Marius, in great anger, attempted to pull them down, and 
<A NAME="162"></A>others aided Sylla, the whole city would have been in tumult and commotion 
<A NAME="163"></A>with this dispute, had not the Social War, which had long lain smouldering, 
<A NAME="164"></A>blazed forth at last, and for the present put an end to the 
<A NAME="165"></A>quarrel.
<A NAME="166"></A><BR><BR>In the course of this war, which had many great changes of fortune, 
<A NAME="167"></A>and which, more than any, afflicted the Romans, and, indeed, endangered 
<A NAME="168"></A>the very being of the Commonwealth, Marius was not able to signalize his 
<A NAME="169"></A>valour in any action, but left behind him a clear proof, that warlike excellence 
<A NAME="170"></A>requires a strong and still vigorous body. Sylla, on the other hand, by 
<A NAME="171"></A>his many achievements, gained himself, with his fellow-citizens, the name 
<A NAME="172"></A>of a great commander, while his friends thought him the greatest of all 
<A NAME="173"></A>commanders, and his enemies called him the most fortunate. Nor did this 
<A NAME="174"></A>make the same sort of impression on him as it made on Timotheus the son 
<A NAME="175"></A>of Conon, the Athenian; who, when his adversaries ascribed his successes 
<A NAME="176"></A>to his good luck, and had a painting made, representing him asleep, and 
<A NAME="177"></A>Fortune by his side, casting her nets over the cities, was rough and violent 
<A NAME="178"></A>in his indignation at those who did it, as if, by attributing all to Fortune, 
<A NAME="179"></A>they had robbed him of his just honours; and said to the people on one 
<A NAME="180"></A>occasion at his return from war, "In this, ye men of Athens, Fortune had 
<A NAME="181"></A>no part." A piece of boyish petulance, which the deity, we are told, played 
<A NAME="182"></A>back upon Timotheus; who from that time was never able to achieve anything 
<A NAME="183"></A>that was great, but proving altogether unfortunate in his attempts, and 
<A NAME="184"></A>falling into discredit with the people, was at last banished the city. 
<A NAME="185"></A>Sylla, on the contrary, not only accepted with pleasure the credit of such 
<A NAME="186"></A>divine felicities and favours, but joining himself and extolling and glorifying 
<A NAME="187"></A>what was done, gave the honour of all to Fortune, whether it were out of 
<A NAME="188"></A>boastfulness, or a real feeling of divine agency. He remarks, in his Memoirs, 
<A NAME="189"></A>that of all his well-advised actions, none proved so lucky in the execution 
<A NAME="190"></A>as what he had boldly enterprised, not by calculation, but upon the moment. 
<A NAME="191"></A>And, in the character which he gives of himself, that he was born for fortune 
<A NAME="192"></A>rather than war, he seems to give Fortune a higher place than merit, and, 
<A NAME="193"></A>in short, makes himself entirely the creature of a superior power, accounting 
<A NAME="194"></A>even his concord with Metellus, his equal in office, and his connection 
<A NAME="195"></A>by marriage, a piece of preternatural felicity. For expecting to have met 
<A NAME="196"></A>in him a most troublesome, he found him a most accommodating, colleague. 
<A NAME="197"></A>Moreover, in the Memoirs which he dedicated to Lucullus, he admonished 
<A NAME="198"></A>him to esteem nothing more trustworthy than what the divine powers advise 
<A NAME="199"></A>him by night. And when he was leaving the city with an army, to fight in 
<A NAME="200"></A>the Social War, he relates that the earth near the Laverna opened, and 
<A NAME="201"></A>a quantity of fire came rushing out of it, shooting up with a bright flame 
<A NAME="202"></A>into the heavens. The soothsayers upon this foretold that a person of great 
<A NAME="203"></A>qualities, and of a rare and singular aspect, should take the government 
<A NAME="204"></A>in hand, and quiet the present troubles of the city. Sylla affirms he was 
<A NAME="205"></A>the man, for his golden head of hair made him an extraordinary-looking 
<A NAME="206"></A>man, nor had he any shame, after the great actions he had done, in testifying 
<A NAME="207"></A>to his own great qualities. And thus much of his opinion as to divine 
<A NAME="208"></A>agency.
<A NAME="209"></A><BR><BR>In general he would seem to have been of a very irregular character, 
<A NAME="210"></A>full of inconsistencies with himself much given to rapine, to prodigality 
<A NAME="211"></A>yet more; in promoting or disgracing whom he pleased, alike unaccountable; 
<A NAME="212"></A>cringing to those he stood in need of, and domineering over others who 
<A NAME="213"></A>stood in need of him, so that it was hard to tell whether his nature had 
<A NAME="214"></A>more in it of pride or of servility. As to his unequal distribution of 
<A NAME="215"></A>punishments, as, for example, that upon slight grounds he would put to 
<A NAME="216"></A>the torture, and again would bear patiently with the greatest wrongs; would 
<A NAME="217"></A>readily forgive and he reconciled after the most heinous acts of enmity, 
<A NAME="218"></A>and yet would visit small and inconsiderable offences with death and confiscation 
<A NAME="219"></A>of goods; one might judge that in himself he was really of a violent and 
<A NAME="220"></A>revengeful nature, which, however, he could qualify, upon reflection, for 
<A NAME="221"></A>his interest. In this very Social War, when the soldiers with stones and 
<A NAME="222"></A>clubs had killed an officer of praetorian rank, his own lieutenant, Albinus 
<A NAME="223"></A>by name, he passed by this flagrant crime without any inquiry, giving it 
<A NAME="224"></A>out moreover in a boast, that the soldiers would behave all the better 
<A NAME="225"></A>now, to make amends, by some special bravery, for their breach of discipline. 
<A NAME="226"></A>He took no notice of the clamours of those that cried for justice, but 
<A NAME="227"></A>designing already to supplant Marius, now that he saw the Social War near 
<A NAME="228"></A>its end, he made much of his army, in hopes to get himself declared general 
<A NAME="229"></A>of the forces against Mithridates.
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR>At his return to Rome he was chosen consul with Quintus Pompeius, 
<A NAME="231"></A>in the fiftieth year of his age, and made a most distinguished marriage 
<A NAME="232"></A>with Caecilia, daughter of Metellus, the chief priest. The common people 
<A NAME="233"></A>made a variety of verses in ridicule of the marriage, and many of the nobility 
<A NAME="234"></A>also were disgusted at it, esteeming him, as Livy writes, unworthy of this 
<A NAME="235"></A>connection, whom before they thought worthy of a consulship. This was not 
<A NAME="236"></A>his only wife, for first, in his younger days, he was married to Ilia, 
<A NAME="237"></A>by whom he had a daughter; after her to Aelia; and thirdly to Cloelia, 
<A NAME="238"></A>whom he dismissed as barren, but honourably, and with professions of respect, 
<A NAME="239"></A>adding, moreover, presents. But the match between him and Metella, falling 
<A NAME="240"></A>out a few days after, occasioned suspicions that he had complained of Cloelia 
<A NAME="241"></A>without due cause. To Metella he always showed great deference, so much 
<A NAME="242"></A>so that the people, when anxious for the recall of the exiles of Marius's 
<A NAME="243"></A>party, upon his refusal, entreated the intercession of Metella. And the 
<A NAME="244"></A>Athenians, it is thought, had harder measure, at the capture of their town, 
<A NAME="245"></A>because they used insulting language to Metella in their jests from the 
<A NAME="246"></A>walls during the siege. But of this hereafter.
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR>At present esteeming the consulship but a small matter in comparison 
<A NAME="248"></A>of things to come, he was impatiently carried away in thought to the Mithridatic 
<A NAME="249"></A>War. Here he was withstood by Marius; who out of mad affectation of glory 
<A NAME="250"></A>and thirst for distinction, those never dying passions, though he were 
<A NAME="251"></A>now unwieldy in body, and had given up service, on account of his age, 
<A NAME="252"></A>during the late campaigns, still coveted after command in a distant war 
<A NAME="253"></A>beyond the seas. And whilst Sylla was departed for the camp, to order the 
<A NAME="254"></A>rest of his affairs there, he sate brooding at home, and at last hatched 
<A NAME="255"></A>that execrable sedition, which wrought Rome more mischief than all her 
<A NAME="256"></A>enemies together had done, as was indeed foreshown by the gods. For a flame 
<A NAME="257"></A>broke forth of its own accord, from under the staves of the ensigns, and 
<A NAME="258"></A>was with difficulty extinguished. Three ravens brought their young into 
<A NAME="259"></A>the open road, and ate them, carrying the relics into the nest again. Mice 
<A NAME="260"></A>having gnawed the consecrated gold in one of the temples, the keepers caught 
<A NAME="261"></A>one of them, a female, in a trap; and she bringing forth five young ones 
<A NAME="262"></A>in the very trap, devoured three of them. But what was greatest of all, 
<A NAME="263"></A>in a calm and clear sky there was heard the sound of a trumpet, with such 
<A NAME="264"></A>a loud and dismal blast, as struck terror and amazement into the hearts 
<A NAME="265"></A>of the people. The Etruscan sages affirmed that this prodigy betokened 
<A NAME="266"></A>the mutation of the age, and a general revolution in the world. For according 
<A NAME="267"></A>to them there are in all eight ages, differing one from another in the 
<A NAME="268"></A>lives and the characters of men, and to each of these God has allotted 
<A NAME="269"></A>a certain measure of time, determined by the circuit of the great year. 
<A NAME="270"></A>And when one age is run out, at the approach of another, there appears 
<A NAME="271"></A>some wonderful sign from earth or heaven, such as makes it manifest at 
<A NAME="272"></A>once to those who have made it their business to study such things, that 
<A NAME="273"></A>there has succeeded in the world a new race of men, differing in customs 
<A NAME="274"></A>and institutes of life, and more or less regarded by the gods than the 
<A NAME="275"></A>preceding. Among other great changes that happen, as they say, at the turn 
<A NAME="276"></A>of ages, the art of divination, also, at one time rises in esteem, and 
<A NAME="277"></A>is more successful in its predictions, clearer and surer tokens being sent 
<A NAME="278"></A>from God, and then, again, in another generation declines as low, becoming 
<A NAME="279"></A>mere guesswork for the most part, and discerning future events by dim and 
<A NAME="280"></A>uncertain intimations. This was the mythology of the wisest of the Tuscan 
<A NAME="281"></A>sages, who were thought to possess a knowledge beyond other men. Whilst 
<A NAME="282"></A>the senate sat in consultation with the soothsayers, concerning these prodigies, 
<A NAME="283"></A>in the temple of Bellona, a sparrow came flying in, before them all, with 
<A NAME="284"></A>a grasshopper in its mouth, and letting fall one part of it, flew away 
<A NAME="285"></A>with the remainder. The diviners foreboded commotions and dissensions between 
<A NAME="286"></A>the great landed proprietors and the common city populace; the latter, 
<A NAME="287"></A>like the grasshopper, being loud and talkative; while the sparrow might 
<A NAME="288"></A>represent the "dwellers in the field."
<A NAME="289"></A><BR><BR>Marius had taken into alliance Sulpicius, the tribune, a man second 
<A NAME="290"></A>to none in any villainies, so that it was less the question what others 
<A NAME="291"></A>he surpassed, but rather in what respects he most surpassed himself in 
<A NAME="292"></A>wickedness. He was cruel, bold, rapacious, and in all these points utterly 
<A NAME="293"></A>shameless and unscrupulous; not hesitating to offer Roman citizenship by 
<A NAME="294"></A>public sale to freed slaves and aliens, and to count out the price on public 
<A NAME="295"></A>money-tables in the forum. He maintained three thousand swordsmen, and 
<A NAME="296"></A>had always about him a company of young men of the equestrian class ready 
<A NAME="297"></A>for all occasions, whom he styled his Anti-senate. Having had a law enacted, 
<A NAME="298"></A>that no senator should contract a debt of above two thousand drachmas, 
<A NAME="299"></A>he himself, after death, was found indebted three millions. This was the 
<A NAME="300"></A>man whom Marius let in upon the Commonwealth, and who, confounding all 
<A NAME="301"></A>things by force and the sword, made several ordinances of dangerous consequence, 
<A NAME="302"></A>and amongst the rest one giving Marius the conduct of the Mithridatic war. 
<A NAME="303"></A>Upon this the consuls proclaimed a public cessation of business, but as 
<A NAME="304"></A>they were holding an assembly near the temple of Castor and Pollux, he 
<A NAME="305"></A>let loose the rabble upon them, and amongst many others slew the consul 
<A NAME="306"></A>Pompeius's young son in the forum, Pompeius himself hardly escaping in 
<A NAME="307"></A>the crowd. Sylla, being closely pursued into the house of Marius, was forced 
<A NAME="308"></A>to come forth and dissolve the cessation; and for his doing this, Sulpicius, 
<A NAME="309"></A>having deposed Pompeius, allowed Sylla to continue his consulship, only 
<A NAME="310"></A>transferring the Mithridatic expedition to Marius.
<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR>There were immediately despatched to Nola tribunes to receive the 
<A NAME="312"></A>army, and bring it to Marius; but Sylla, having got first to the camp, 
<A NAME="313"></A>and the soldiers, upon hearing the news, having stoned the tribunes, Marius, 
<A NAME="314"></A>in requital, proceeded to put the friends of Sylla in the city to the sword, 
<A NAME="315"></A>and rifled their goods. Every kind of removal and flight went on, some 
<A NAME="316"></A>hastening from the camp to the city, others from the city to the camp. 
<A NAME="317"></A>The senate, no more in its own power, but wholly governed by the dictates 
<A NAME="318"></A>of Marius and Sulpicius, alarmed at the report of Sylla's advancing with 
<A NAME="319"></A>his troops towards the city, sent forth two of the praetors, Brutus and 
<A NAME="320"></A>Servilius, to forbid his nearer approach. The soldiers would have slain 
<A NAME="321"></A>these praetors in a fury, for their bold language to Sylla; contenting 
<A NAME="322"></A>themselves, however, with breaking their rods, and tearing off their purple-edged 
<A NAME="323"></A>robes, after much contumelious usage they sent them back, to the sad dejection 
<A NAME="324"></A>of the citizens, who beheld their magistrates despoiled of their badges 
<A NAME="325"></A>of office, and announcing to them that things were now manifestly come 
<A NAME="326"></A>to a rupture past all cure. Marius put himself in readiness, and Sylla 
<A NAME="327"></A>with his colleague moved from Nola, at the head of six complete legions, 
<A NAME="328"></A>all of them willing to march up directly against the city, though he himself 
<A NAME="329"></A>as yet was doubtful in thought, and apprehensive of the danger. As he was 
<A NAME="330"></A>sacrificing, Postumius the soothsayer, having inspected the entrails, stretching 
<A NAME="331"></A>forth both hands to Sylla, required to be bound and kept in custody till 
<A NAME="332"></A>the battle was over, as willing, if they had not speedy and complete success, 
<A NAME="333"></A>to suffer the utmost punishment. It is said, also, that there appeared 
<A NAME="334"></A>to Sylla himself, in a dream, a certain goddess, whom the Romans learnt 
<A NAME="335"></A>to worship from the Cappadocians, whether it be the Moon, or Pallas, or 
<A NAME="336"></A>Bellona. This same goddess, to his thinking, stood by him, and put into 
<A NAME="337"></A>his hand thunder and lightning, then naming his enemies one by one, bade 
<A NAME="338"></A>him strike them, who, all of them, fell on the discharge and disappeared. 
<A NAME="339"></A>Encouraged by this vision, and relating it to his colleague, next day he 
<A NAME="340"></A>led on towards Rome. About Picinae being met by a deputation, beseeching 
<A NAME="341"></A>him not to attack at once, in the heat of a march, for that the senate 
<A NAME="342"></A>had decreed to do him all the right imaginable, he consented to halt on 
<A NAME="343"></A>the spot, and sent his officers to measure out the ground, as is usual, 
<A NAME="344"></A>for a camp; so that the deputation, believing it, returned. They were no 
<A NAME="345"></A>sooner gone, but he sent a party on under the command of Lucius Basillus 
<A NAME="346"></A>and Caius Mummius, to secure the city gate, and the walls on the side of 
<A NAME="347"></A>the Esquiline hill, and then close at their heels followed himself with 
<A NAME="348"></A>all speed. Basillus made his way successfully into the city, but the unarmed 
<A NAME="349"></A>multitude, pelting him with stones and tiles from off the houses, stopped 
<A NAME="350"></A>his further progress, and beat him back to the wall. Sylla by this time 
<A NAME="351"></A>was come up, and seeing what was going on, called aloud to his men to set 
<A NAME="352"></A>fire to the houses, and taking a flaming torch, he himself led the way, 
<A NAME="353"></A>and commanded the archers to make use of their fire-darts, letting fly 
<A NAME="354"></A>at the tops of houses; all which he did, not upon any plan, but simply 
<A NAME="355"></A>in his fury, yielding the conduct of that day's work to passion, and as 
<A NAME="356"></A>if all he saw were enemies, without respect or pity either to friends, 
<A NAME="357"></A>relations, or acquaintance, made his entry by fire, which knows no distinction 
<A NAME="358"></A>betwixt friend or foe.
<A NAME="359"></A><BR><BR>In this conflict, Marius, being driven into the temple of Mother-Earth, 
<A NAME="360"></A>thence invited the slaves by proclamation of freedom, but the enemy coming 
<A NAME="361"></A>on he was overpowered and fled the city.
<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR>Sylla having called a senate, had sentence of death passed on Marius, 
<A NAME="363"></A>and some few others, amongst whom was Sulpicius, tribune of the people. 
<A NAME="364"></A>Sulpicius was killed, being betrayed by his servant, whom Sylla first made 
<A NAME="365"></A>free, and then threw him headlong down the Tarpeian rock. As for Marius, 
<A NAME="366"></A>he set a price on his life, by proclamation, neither gratefully nor politically, 
<A NAME="367"></A>if we consider into whose house, not long before, he put himself at mercy, 
<A NAME="368"></A>and safely dismissed. Had Marius at that time not let Sylla go, but suffered 
<A NAME="369"></A>him to be slain by the hands of Sulpicius, he might have been lord of all: 
<A NAME="370"></A>nevertheless he spared his life, and a few days after, when in a similar 
<A NAME="371"></A>position himself, received a different measure.
<A NAME="372"></A><BR><BR>By these proceedings Sylla excited the secret distaste of the senate; 
<A NAME="373"></A>but the displeasure and free indignation of the commonalty showed itself 
<A NAME="374"></A>plainly by their actions. For they ignominiously rejected Nonius, his nephew, 
<A NAME="375"></A>and Servius, who stood for offices of state by his interest, and elected 
<A NAME="376"></A>others as magistrates, by honouring whom they thought they should most 
<A NAME="377"></A>annoy him. He made semblance of extreme satisfaction at all this, as if 
<A NAME="378"></A>the people by his means had again enjoyed the liberty of doing what seemed 
<A NAME="379"></A>best to them. And to pacify the public hostility, he created Lucius Cinna 
<A NAME="380"></A>consul, one of the adverse party, having first bound him under oaths and 
<A NAME="381"></A>imprecations to be favourable to his interest. For Cinna, ascending the 
<A NAME="382"></A>capitol with a stone in his hand, swore solemnly, and prayed with direful 
<A NAME="383"></A>curses, that he himself, if he were not true to his friendship with Sylla, 
<A NAME="384"></A>might be cast out of the city, as that stone out of his hand; and thereupon 
<A NAME="385"></A>cast the stone to the ground, in the presence of many people. Nevertheless 
<A NAME="386"></A>Cinna had no sooner entered on his charge, but he took measures to disturb 
<A NAME="387"></A>the present settlement, having prepared an impeachment against Sylla, got 
<A NAME="388"></A>Virginius, one of the tribunes of the people, to be his accuser; but Sylla, 
<A NAME="389"></A>leaving him and the court of judicature to themselves, set forth against 
<A NAME="390"></A>Mithridates.
<A NAME="391"></A><BR><BR>About the time that Sylla was making ready to put off with his 
<A NAME="392"></A>force from Italy, besides many other omens which befell Mithridates, then 
<A NAME="393"></A>staying at Pergamus, there goes a story that a figure of Victory, with 
<A NAME="394"></A>a crown in her hand, which the Pergamenians by machinery from above let 
<A NAME="395"></A>down on him, when it had almost reached his head, fell to pieces, and the 
<A NAME="396"></A>crown tumbling down into the midst of the theatre, there broke against 
<A NAME="397"></A>the ground, occasioning a general alarm among the populace, and considerably 
<A NAME="398"></A>disquieting Mithridates himself, although his affairs at that time were 
<A NAME="399"></A>succeeding beyond expectation. For having wrested Asia from the Romans, 
<A NAME="400"></A>and Bithynia and Cappadocia from their kings, he made Pergamus his royal 
<A NAME="401"></A>seat, distributing among his friends riches, principalities, and kingdoms. 
<A NAME="402"></A>Of his sons, one residing in Pontus and Bosporus held his ancient realm 
<A NAME="403"></A>as far as the deserts beyond the lake Maeotis, without molestation; while 
<A NAME="404"></A>Ariarathes, another, was reducing Thrace and Macedon, with a great army, 
<A NAME="405"></A>to obedience. His generals, with forces under them, were establishing his 
<A NAME="406"></A>supremacy in other quarters. Archelaus, in particular, with his fleet, 
<A NAME="407"></A>held absolute mastery of the sea, and was bringing into subjection the 
<A NAME="408"></A>Cyclades, and all the other islands as far as Malea, and had taken Euboea 
<A NAME="409"></A>itself. Making Athens his headquarters, from thence as far as Thessaly 
<A NAME="410"></A>he was withdrawing the states of Greece from the Roman allegiance, without 
<A NAME="411"></A>the least ill-success, except at Chaeronea. For here Bruttius Sura, lieutenant 
<A NAME="412"></A>to Sentius, governor of Macedon, a man of singular valour and prudence, 
<A NAME="413"></A>met him, and, though he came like a torrent pouring over Boeotia, made 
<A NAME="414"></A>stout resistance, and thrice giving him battle near Chaeronea, repulsed 
<A NAME="415"></A>and forced him back to the sea. But being commanded by Lucius Lucullus 
<A NAME="416"></A>to give place to his successor, Sylla, and resign the war to whom it was 
<A NAME="417"></A>decreed, he presently left Boeotia, and retired back to Sentius, although 
<A NAME="418"></A>his success had outgone all hopes, and Greece was well disposed to a new 
<A NAME="419"></A>revolution, upon account of his gallant behaviour. These were the glorious 
<A NAME="420"></A>actions of Bruttius.
<A NAME="421"></A><BR><BR>Sylla, on his arrival, received by their deputations the compliments 
<A NAME="422"></A>of all the cities of Greece, except Athens, against which, as it was compelled 
<A NAME="423"></A>by the tyrant Aristion to hold for the king, he advanced with all his forces, 
<A NAME="424"></A>and investing the Piraeus, laid formal siege to it, employing every variety 
<A NAME="425"></A>of engines, and trying every manner of assault; whereas, had he forborn 
<A NAME="426"></A>but a little while, he might without hazard have taken the Upper City by 
<A NAME="427"></A>famine, it being already reduced to the last extremity, through want of 
<A NAME="428"></A>necessaries. But eager to return to Rome, and fearing innovation there, 
<A NAME="429"></A>at great risk, with continual fighting and vast expense, he pushed on the 
<A NAME="430"></A>war. Besides other equipage, the very work about the engines of battery 
<A NAME="431"></A>was supplied with no less than ten thousand yoke of mules, employed daily 
<A NAME="432"></A>in that service. And when timber grew scarce, for many of the works failed, 
<A NAME="433"></A>some crushed to pieces by their own weight, others taking fire by the continual 
<A NAME="434"></A>play of the enemy, he had recourse to the sacred groves, and cut down the 
<A NAME="435"></A>trees of the Academy, the shadiest of all the suburbs, and the Lyceum. 
<A NAME="436"></A>And a vast sum of money being wanted to carry on the war, he broke into 
<A NAME="437"></A>the sanctuaries of Greece, that of Epidaurus and that of Olympia, sending 
<A NAME="438"></A>for the most beautiful and precious offerings deposited there. He wrote, 
<A NAME="439"></A>likewise, to the Amphictyons at Delphi, that it were better to remit the 
<A NAME="440"></A>wealth of the god to him, for that he would keep it more securely, or in 
<A NAME="441"></A>case he made use of it, restore as much. He sent Caphis, the Phocian, one 
<A NAME="442"></A>of his friends, with this message, commanding him to receive each item 
<A NAME="443"></A>by weight. Caphis came to Delphi, but was loth to touch the holy things, 
<A NAME="444"></A>and with many tears, in the presence of the Amphictyons, bewailed the necessity. 
<A NAME="445"></A>And on some of them declaring they heard the sound of a harp from the inner 
<A NAME="446"></A>shrine, he, whether he himself believed it, or was willing to try the effect 
<A NAME="447"></A>of religious fear upon Sylla, sent back an express. To which Sylla replied 
<A NAME="448"></A>in a scoffing way, that it was surprising to him that Caphis did not know 
<A NAME="449"></A>that music was a sign of joy, not anger; he should, therefore, go on boldly, 
<A NAME="450"></A>and accept what a gracious and bountiful god offered.
<A NAME="451"></A><BR><BR>Other things were sent away without much notice on the part of 
<A NAME="452"></A>the Greeks in general, but in the case of the silver tun, that only relic 
<A NAME="453"></A>of the regal donations, which its weight and bulk made it impossible for 
<A NAME="454"></A>any carriage to receive, the Amphictyons were forced to cut it into pieces, 
<A NAME="455"></A>and called to mind in so doing, how Titus Flamininus, and Manius Acilius, 
<A NAME="456"></A>and again Paulus Aemilius, one of whom drove Antiochus out of Greece, and 
<A NAME="457"></A>the others subdued the Macedonian kings, had not only abstained from violating 
<A NAME="458"></A>the Greek temples, but had even given them new gifts and honours, and increased 
<A NAME="459"></A>the general veneration for them. They, indeed, the lawful commanders of 
<A NAME="460"></A>temperate and obedient soldiers, and themselves great in soul, and simple 
<A NAME="461"></A>in expenses, lived within the bounds of the ordinary established charges, 
<A NAME="462"></A>accounting it a greater disgrace to seek popularity with their men, than 
<A NAME="463"></A>to feel fear of their enemy. Whereas the commanders of these times, attaining 
<A NAME="464"></A>to superiority by force, not worth, and having need of arms one against 
<A NAME="465"></A>another, rather than against the public enemy, were constrained to temporize 
<A NAME="466"></A>in authority, and in order to pay for the gratifications with which they 
<A NAME="467"></A>purchased the labour of their soldiers, were driven, before they knew it, 
<A NAME="468"></A>to sell the commonwealth itself, and, to gain the mastery over men better 
<A NAME="469"></A>than themselves, were content to become slaves to the vilest of wretches. 
<A NAME="470"></A>These practices drove Marius into exile. and again brought him in against 
<A NAME="471"></A>Sylla. These made Cinna the assassin of Octavius, and Fimbria of Flaccus. 
<A NAME="472"></A>To which courses Sylla contributed not the least; for to corrupt and win 
<A NAME="473"></A>over those who were under the command of others, he would be munificent 
<A NAME="474"></A>and profuse towards those who were under his own; and so, while tempting 
<A NAME="475"></A>the soldiers of other generals to treachery, and his own to dissolute living, 
<A NAME="476"></A>he was naturally in want of a large treasury, and especially during that 
<A NAME="477"></A>siege.
<A NAME="478"></A><BR><BR>Sylla had a vehement and an implacable desire to conquer Athens. 
<A NAME="479"></A>whether out of emulation, fighting as it were against the shadow of the 
<A NAME="480"></A>once famous city, or out of anger, at the foul words and scurrilous jests 
<A NAME="481"></A>with which the tyrant Aristion, showing himself daily, with unseemly gesticulations, 
<A NAME="482"></A>upon the walls, had provoked him and Metella.
<A NAME="483"></A><BR><BR>The tyrant Aristion had his very being compounded of wantonness 
<A NAME="484"></A>and cruelty, having gathered into himself all the worst of Mithridates's 
<A NAME="485"></A>diseased and vicious qualities, like some fatal malady which the city, 
<A NAME="486"></A>after its deliverance from innumerable wars, many tyrannies and seditions, 
<A NAME="487"></A>was in its last days destined to endure. At the time when a medimnus of 
<A NAME="488"></A>wheat was sold in the city for one thousand drachmas and men were forced 
<A NAME="489"></A>to live on the feverfew growing round the citadel, and to boil down shoes 
<A NAME="490"></A>and oil-bags for their food, he, carousing and feasting in the open face 
<A NAME="491"></A>of day, then dancing in armour, and making jokes at the enemy, suffered 
<A NAME="492"></A>the holy lamp of the goddess to expire for want of oil, and to the chief 
<A NAME="493"></A>priestess, who demanded of him the twelfth part of a medimnus of wheat, 
<A NAME="494"></A>he sent the like quantity of pepper. The senators and priests who came 
<A NAME="495"></A>as suppliants to beg of him to take compassion on the city, and treat for 
<A NAME="496"></A>peace with Sylla, he drove away and dispersed with a flight of arrows. 
<A NAME="497"></A>At last, with much ado, he sent forth two or three of his revelling companions 
<A NAME="498"></A>to parley, to whom Sylla, perceiving that they made no serious overtures 
<A NAME="499"></A>towards an accommodation, but went on haranguing in praise of Theseus, 
<A NAME="500"></A>Eumolpus, and the Median trophies, replied, "My good friends, you may put 
<A NAME="501"></A>up your speeches and be gone. I was sent by the Romans to Athens, not to 
<A NAME="502"></A>take lessons, but to reduce rebels to obedience."
<A NAME="503"></A><BR><BR>In the meantime news came to Sylla that some old men, talking in 
<A NAME="504"></A>the Ceramicus, had been overheard to blame the tyrant for not securing 
<A NAME="505"></A>the passages and approaches near the Heptachalcum, the one point where 
<A NAME="506"></A>the enemy might easily get over. Sylla neglected not the report, but going 
<A NAME="507"></A>in the night, and discovering the place to be assailable, set instantly 
<A NAME="508"></A>to work. Sylla himself makes mention in his Memoirs that Marcus Teius, 
<A NAME="509"></A>the first man who scaled the wall, meeting with an adversary, and striking 
<A NAME="510"></A>him on the headpiece a home-stroke, broke his own sword, but, notwithstanding, 
<A NAME="511"></A>did not give ground, but stood and held him fast. The city was certainly 
<A NAME="512"></A>taken from that quarter, according to the tradition of the oldest of the 
<A NAME="513"></A>Athenians.
<A NAME="514"></A><BR><BR>When they had thrown down the wall, and made all level betwixt 
<A NAME="515"></A>the Piraic and Sacred Gate, about midnight Sylla entered the breach, with 
<A NAME="516"></A>all the terrors of trumpets and cornets sounding, with the triumphant shout 
<A NAME="517"></A>and cry of an army let loose to spoil and slaughter, and scouring through 
<A NAME="518"></A>the streets with swords drawn. There was no numbering the slain; the amount 
<A NAME="519"></A>is to this day conjectured only from the space of ground overflowed with 
<A NAME="520"></A>blood. For without mentioning the execution done in other quarters of the 
<A NAME="521"></A>city, the blood that was shed about the market-place spread over the whole 
<A NAME="522"></A>Ceramicus within the Double-gate, and, according to most writers, passed 
<A NAME="523"></A>through the gate and overflowed the suburb. Nor did the multitudes which 
<A NAME="524"></A>fell thus exceed the number of those who, out of pity and love for their 
<A NAME="525"></A>country which they believed was now finally to perish, slew themselves; 
<A NAME="526"></A>the best of them, through despair of their country's surviving, dreading 
<A NAME="527"></A>themselves to survive, expecting neither humanity nor moderation in Sylla. 
<A NAME="528"></A>At length, partly at the instance of Midias and Calliphon, two exiled men, 
<A NAME="529"></A>beseeching and casting themselves at his feet, partly by the intercession 
<A NAME="530"></A>of those senators who followed the camp, having had his fill of revenge, 
<A NAME="531"></A>and making some honourable mention of the ancient Athenians, "I forgive," 
<A NAME="532"></A>said he, "the many for the sake of the few, the living for the dead." He 
<A NAME="533"></A>took Athens, according to his own Memoirs, on the calends of March, coinciding 
<A NAME="534"></A>pretty nearly with the new moon of Anthesterion, on which day it is the 
<A NAME="535"></A>Athenian usage to perform various acts in commemoration of the ruins and 
<A NAME="536"></A>devastations occasioned by the deluge, that being supposed to be the time 
<A NAME="537"></A>of its occurrence.
<A NAME="538"></A><BR><BR>At the taking of the town, the tyrant fled into the citadel, and 
<A NAME="539"></A>was there besieged by Curio, who had that charge given him. He held out 
<A NAME="540"></A>a considerable time, but at last yielded himself up for want of water, 
<A NAME="541"></A>and divine power immediately intimated its agency in the matter. For on 
<A NAME="542"></A>the same day and hour that Curio conducted him down, the clouds gathered 
<A NAME="543"></A>in a clear sky, and there came down a great quantity of rain and filled 
<A NAME="544"></A>the citadel with water.
<A NAME="545"></A><BR><BR>Not long after, Sylla won the Piraeus, and burnt most of it; amongst 
<A NAME="546"></A>the rest, Philo's arsenal, a work very greatly admired.
<A NAME="547"></A><BR><BR>In the meantime Taxiles, Mithridates's general, coming down from 
<A NAME="548"></A>Thrace and Macedon, with an army of one hundred thousand foot, ten thousand 
<A NAME="549"></A>horse, and ninety chariots, armed with scythes at the wheels, would have 
<A NAME="550"></A>joined Archelaus, who lay with a navy on the coast near Munychia, reluctant 
<A NAME="551"></A>to quit the sea, and yet unwilling to engage the Romans in battle, but 
<A NAME="552"></A>desiring to protract the war and cut off the enemy's supplies. Which Sylla 
<A NAME="553"></A>perceiving much better than himself, passed with his forces into Boeotia, 
<A NAME="554"></A>quitting a barren district which was inadequate to maintain an army even 
<A NAME="555"></A>in time of peace. He was thought by some to have taken false measures in 
<A NAME="556"></A>thus leaving Attica, a rugged country, and ill suited for cavalry to move 
<A NAME="557"></A>in, and entering the plain and open fields of Boeotia, knowing as he did 
<A NAME="558"></A>the barbarian strength to consist most in horses and chariots. But as was 
<A NAME="559"></A>said before, to avoid famine and scarcity, he was forced to run the risk 
<A NAME="560"></A>of a battle. Moreover he was in anxiety for Hortensius, a bold and active 
<A NAME="561"></A>officer, whom on his way to Sylla with forces from Thessaly, the barbarians 
<A NAME="562"></A>awaited in the straits. For these reasons Sylla drew off into Boeotia. 
<A NAME="563"></A>Hortensius, meantime, was conducted by Caphis, our countryman, another 
<A NAME="564"></A>way unknown to the barbarians, by Parnassus, just under Tithora, which 
<A NAME="565"></A>was then not so large a town as it is now, but a mere fort, surrounded 
<A NAME="566"></A>by steep precipices whither the Phocians also, in old times, when flying 
<A NAME="567"></A>from the invasion of Xerxes, carried themselves and their goods and were 
<A NAME="568"></A>saved. Hortensius, encamping here, kept off the enemy by day, and at night 
<A NAME="569"></A>descending by difficult passages to Patronis, joined the forces of Sylla 
<A NAME="570"></A>who came to meet him. Thus united they posted themselves on a fertile hill 
<A NAME="571"></A>in the middle of the plain of Elatea, shaded with trees and watered at 
<A NAME="572"></A>the foot. It is called Philoboeotus, and its situation and natural advantages 
<A NAME="573"></A>are spoken of with great admiration by Sylla.
<A NAME="574"></A><BR><BR>As they lay thus encamped, they seemed to the enemy a contemptible 
<A NAME="575"></A>number, for there were not above fifteen hundred horse, and less than fifteen 
<A NAME="576"></A>thousand foot. Therefore the rest of the commanders, over-persuading Archelaus 
<A NAME="577"></A>and drawing up the army, covered the plain with horses, chariots, bucklers, 
<A NAME="578"></A>targets. The clamour and cries of so many nations forming for battle rent 
<A NAME="579"></A>the air, nor was the pomp and ostentation of their costly array altogether 
<A NAME="580"></A>idle and unserviceable for terror; for the brightness of their armour, 
<A NAME="581"></A>embellished magnificently with gold and silver, and the rich colours of 
<A NAME="582"></A>their Median and Scythian coats, intermixed with brass and shining steel, 
<A NAME="583"></A>presented a flaming and terrible sight as they swayed about and moved in 
<A NAME="584"></A>their ranks, so much so that the Romans shrunk within their trenches, and 
<A NAME="585"></A>Sylla, unable by any arguments to remove their fear, and unwilling to force 
<A NAME="586"></A>them to fight against their wills, was fain to sit down in quiet, ill-brooking 
<A NAME="587"></A>to become the subject of barbarian insolence and laughter. This, however, 
<A NAME="588"></A>above all advantaged him, for the enemy, from contemning of him, fell into 
<A NAME="589"></A>disorder amongst themselves, being already less thoroughly under command, 
<A NAME="590"></A>on account of the number of their leaders. Some few of them remained within 
<A NAME="591"></A>the encampment, but others, the major part, lured out with hopes of prey 
<A NAME="592"></A>and rapine, strayed about the country many days' journey from the camp, 
<A NAME="593"></A>and are related to have destroyed the city of Panope, to have plundered 
<A NAME="594"></A>Lebadea, and robbed the oracle without any orders from their 
<A NAME="595"></A>commanders.
<A NAME="596"></A><BR><BR>Sylla, all this while, chafing and fretting to see the cities all 
<A NAME="597"></A>around destroyed, suffered not the soldiery to remain idle, but leading 
<A NAME="598"></A>them out, compelled them to divert the Cephisus from its ancient channel 
<A NAME="599"></A>by casting up ditches, and giving respite to none, showed himself rigorous 
<A NAME="600"></A>in punishing the remiss, that growing weary of labour, they might be induced 
<A NAME="601"></A>by hardship to embrace danger. Which fell out accordingly, for on the third 
<A NAME="602"></A>day, being hard at work as Sylla passed by, they begged and clamoured to 
<A NAME="603"></A>be led against the enemy. Sylla replied, that this demand of war proceeded 
<A NAME="604"></A>rather from a backwardness to labour than any forwardness to fight, but 
<A NAME="605"></A>if they were in good earnest martially inclined, he bade them take their 
<A NAME="606"></A>arms and get up thither, pointing to the ancient citadel of the Parapotamians, 
<A NAME="607"></A>of which at present, the city being laid waste, there remained only the 
<A NAME="608"></A>rocky hill itself, steep and craggy on all sides, and severed from Mount 
<A NAME="609"></A>Hedylium by the breadth of the river Assus, which, running between, and 
<A NAME="610"></A>at the bottom of the same hill falling into the Cephisus with an impetuous 
<A NAME="611"></A>confluence, makes this eminence a strong position for soldiers to occupy. 
<A NAME="612"></A>Observing that the enemy's division, called the Brazen Shields, were making 
<A NAME="613"></A>their way up thither, Sylla was willing to take first possession, and by 
<A NAME="614"></A>the vigorous efforts of the soldiers, succeeded. Archelaus, driven from 
<A NAME="615"></A>hence, bent his forces upon Chaeronea. The Chaeroneans who bore arms in 
<A NAME="616"></A>the Roman camp beseeching Sylla not to abandon the city, he despatched 
<A NAME="617"></A>Gabinius, a tribune, with one legion, and sent out also the Chaeroneans, 
<A NAME="618"></A>who endeavoured, but were not able to get in before Gabinius; so active 
<A NAME="619"></A>was he, and more zealous to bring relief than those who had entreated it. 
<A NAME="620"></A>Juba writes that Ericius was the man sent, not Gabinius. Thus narrowly 
<A NAME="621"></A>did our native city escape.
<A NAME="622"></A><BR><BR>From Lebadea and the cave of Trophonius there came favourable rumours 
<A NAME="623"></A>and prophecies of victory to the Romans, of which the inhabitants of those 
<A NAME="624"></A>places gave a fuller account, but as Sylla himself affirms in the tenth 
<A NAME="625"></A>book of his Memoirs, Quintus Titius, a man of some repute among the Romans 
<A NAME="626"></A>who were engaged in mercantile business in Greece, came to him after the 
<A NAME="627"></A>battle won at Chaeronea, and declared that Trophonius had foretold another 
<A NAME="628"></A>fight and victory on the place, within a short time. After him a soldier, 
<A NAME="629"></A>by name Salvenius, brought an account from the god of the future issue 
<A NAME="630"></A>of affairs in Italy. As to the vision, they both agreed in this, that they 
<A NAME="631"></A>had seen one who in stature and in majesty was similar to Jupiter 
<A NAME="632"></A>Olympius.
<A NAME="633"></A><BR><BR>Sylla, when he had passed over the Assus, marching under the Mount 
<A NAME="634"></A>Hedylium, encamped close to Archelaus, who had intrenched himself strongly 
<A NAME="635"></A>between the mountains Acontium and Hedylium, close to what are called the 
<A NAME="636"></A>Assia. The place of his intrenchment is to this day named from him, Archelaus. 
<A NAME="637"></A>Sylla, after one day's respite, having left Murena behind him with one 
<A NAME="638"></A>legion and two cohorts to amuse the enemy with continual alarms, himself 
<A NAME="639"></A>went and sacrificed on the banks of Cephisus, and the holy rites ended, 
<A NAME="640"></A>held on towards Chaeronea to receive the forces there and view Mount Thurium, 
<A NAME="641"></A>where a party of the enemy had posted themselves. This is a craggy height 
<A NAME="642"></A>running up in a conical form to a point called by us Orthopagus; at the 
<A NAME="643"></A>foot of it is the river Morius and the temple of Apollo Thurius. The god 
<A NAME="644"></A>had his surname from Thuro, mother of Chaeron, whom ancient record makes 
<A NAME="645"></A>founder of Chaeronea. Others assert that the cow, which Apollo gave to 
<A NAME="646"></A>Cadmus for a guide, appeared there, and that the place took its name from 
<A NAME="647"></A>the beast, Thor being the Phoenician word for cow.
<A NAME="648"></A><BR><BR>At Sylla's approach to Chaeronea, the tribune who had been appointed 
<A NAME="649"></A>to guard the city led out his men in arms, and met him with a garland of 
<A NAME="650"></A>laurel in his hand; which Sylla accepting, and at the same time saluting 
<A NAME="651"></A>the soldiers and animating them to the encounter, two men of Chaeronea, 
<A NAME="652"></A>Homoloichus and Anaxidamus, presented themselves before him, and offered, 
<A NAME="653"></A>with a small party, to dislodge those who were posted on Thurium. For there 
<A NAME="654"></A>lay a path out of sight of the barbarians, from what is called Petrochus 
<A NAME="655"></A>along by the Museum, leading right down from above upon Thurium. By this 
<A NAME="656"></A>way it was easy to fall upon them and either stone them from above or force 
<A NAME="657"></A>them down into the plain. Sylla, assured of their faith and courage by 
<A NAME="658"></A>Gabinius, bade them proceed with the enterprise, and meantime drew up the 
<A NAME="659"></A>army, and disposing the cavalry on both wings, himself took command of 
<A NAME="660"></A>the right; the left being committed to the direction of Murena. In the 
<A NAME="661"></A>rear of all, Galba and Hortensius, his lieutenants, planted themselves 
<A NAME="662"></A>on the upper grounds with the cohorts of reserve, to watch the motions 
<A NAME="663"></A>of the enemy, who, with numbers of horse and swift-footed, light-armed 
<A NAME="664"></A>infantry, were noticed to have so formed their wing as to allow it readily 
<A NAME="665"></A>to change about and alter its position, and thus gave reason for suspecting 
<A NAME="666"></A>that they intended to carry it far out and so to inclose the 
<A NAME="667"></A>Romans.
<A NAME="668"></A><BR><BR>In the meanwhile, the Chaeroneans, who had Ericius for commander 
<A NAME="669"></A>by appointment of Sylla, covertly making their way around Thurium, and 
<A NAME="670"></A>then discovering themselves, occasioned a great confusion and rout among 
<A NAME="671"></A>the barbarians, and slaughter, for the most part, by their own hands. For 
<A NAME="672"></A>they kept not their place, but making down the steep descent, ran themselves 
<A NAME="673"></A>on their own spears, and violently sent each other over the cliffs the 
<A NAME="674"></A>enemy from above pressing on and wounding them where they exposed their 
<A NAME="675"></A>bodies; insomuch that there fell three thousand about Thurium. Some of 
<A NAME="676"></A>those who escaped, being met by Murena as he stood in array, were cut off 
<A NAME="677"></A>and destroyed. Others breaking through to their friends and falling pell-mell 
<A NAME="678"></A>into the ranks, filled most part of the army with fear and tumult, and 
<A NAME="679"></A>caused a hesitation and delay among the generals, which was no small disadvantage. 
<A NAME="680"></A>For immediately upon the discomposure, Sylla coming full speed to the charge, 
<A NAME="681"></A>and quickly crossing the interval between the armies, lost them the service 
<A NAME="682"></A>of their armed chariots, which require a considerable space of ground to 
<A NAME="683"></A>gather strength and impetuosity in their career, a short course being weak 
<A NAME="684"></A>and ineffectual, like that of missiles without a full swing. Thus it fared 
<A NAME="685"></A>with the barbarians at present, whose first chariots came feebly on and 
<A NAME="686"></A>made but a faint impression; the Romans, repulsing them with shouts and 
<A NAME="687"></A>laughter, called out, as they do at the races in the circus, for more to 
<A NAME="688"></A>come. By this time the mass of both armies met; the barbarians on one side 
<A NAME="689"></A>fixed their long pikes, and with their shields locked close together, strove 
<A NAME="690"></A>so far as in them lay to preserve their line of battle entire. The Romans, 
<A NAME="691"></A>on the other side, having discharged their javelins, rushed on with their 
<A NAME="692"></A>drawn swords, and struggled to put by the pikes to get at them the sooner, 
<A NAME="693"></A>in the fury that possessed them at seeing in the front of the enemy fifteen 
<A NAME="694"></A>thousand slaves, whom the royal commanders had set free by proclamation, 
<A NAME="695"></A>and ranged amongst the men of arms. And a Roman centurion is reported to 
<A NAME="696"></A>have said at this sight, that he never knew servants allowed to play the 
<A NAME="697"></A>masters, unless at the Saturnalia. These men, by their deep and solid array, 
<A NAME="698"></A>as well as by their daring courage, yielded but slowly to the legions, 
<A NAME="699"></A>till at last by slinging engines, and darts, which the Romans poured in 
<A NAME="700"></A>upon them behind, they were forced to give way and scatter.
<A NAME="701"></A><BR><BR>As Archelaus was extending the right wing to encompass the enemy, 
<A NAME="702"></A>Hortensius with his cohorts came down in force, with intention to charge 
<A NAME="703"></A>him in the flank. But Archelaus wheeling about suddenly with two thousand 
<A NAME="704"></A>horse, Hortensius, out-numbered and hard pressed, fell back towards the 
<A NAME="705"></A>higher grounds, and found himself gradually getting separated from the 
<A NAME="706"></A>main body and likely to be surrounded by the enemy. When Sylla heard this, 
<A NAME="707"></A>he came rapidly up to his succour from the right wing, which as yet had 
<A NAME="708"></A>not engaged. But Archelaus, guessing the matter by the dust of his troops, 
<A NAME="709"></A>turned to the right wing, from whence Sylla came, in hopes to surprise 
<A NAME="710"></A>it without a commander. At the same instant, likewise, Taxiles, with his 
<A NAME="711"></A>Brazen Shields, assailed Murena, so that a cry coming from both places, 
<A NAME="712"></A>and the hills repeating it around, Sylla stood in suspense which way to 
<A NAME="713"></A>move. Deciding to resume his own station he sent in aid to Murena four 
<A NAME="714"></A>cohorts under Hortensius, and commanding the fifth to follow him, returned 
<A NAME="715"></A>hastily to the right wing, which of itself held its ground on equal terms 
<A NAME="716"></A>against Archelaus; and, at his appearance, with one bold effort forced 
<A NAME="717"></A>them back, and, obtaining the mastery, followed them, flying in disorder 
<A NAME="718"></A>to the river and Mount Acontium. Sylla, however, did not forget the danger 
<A NAME="719"></A>Murena was in; but hasting thither and finding him victorious also, then 
<A NAME="720"></A>joined in the pursuit. Many barbarians were slain in the field, many more 
<A NAME="721"></A>were cut in pieces as they were making into the camp. Of all the vast multitude, 
<A NAME="722"></A>ten thousand only got safe intoe Chalcis. Sylla writes that there were 
<A NAME="723"></A>but fourteen of his soldiers missing, and that two of these returned towards 
<A NAME="724"></A>evening; he, therefore, inscribed on the trophies the names of Mars, Victory, 
<A NAME="725"></A>and Venus, as having won the day no less by good fortune than by management 
<A NAME="726"></A>and force of arms. This trophy of the battle in the plain stands on the 
<A NAME="727"></A>place where Archelaus first gave way, near the stream of the Molus; another 
<A NAME="728"></A>is erected high on the top of Thurium, where the barbarians were environed, 
<A NAME="729"></A>with an inscription in Greek, recording that the glory of the day belonged 
<A NAME="730"></A>to Homoloichus and Anaxidamus. Sylla celebrated his victory at Thebes with 
<A NAME="731"></A>spectacles, for which he erected a stage, near Oedipus's well. The judges 
<A NAME="732"></A>of the performances were Greeks chosen out of other cities; his hostility 
<A NAME="733"></A>to the Thebans being implacable, half of whose territory he took away and 
<A NAME="734"></A>consecrated to Apollo and Jupiter, ordering that out of the revenue compensation 
<A NAME="735"></A>should be made to the gods for the riches himself had taken from 
<A NAME="736"></A>them.
<A NAME="737"></A><BR><BR>After this, hearing that Flaccus, a man of the contrary faction, 
<A NAME="738"></A>had been chosen consul, and was crossing the Ionian Sea with an army, professedly 
<A NAME="739"></A>to act against Mithridates, but in reality against himself, he hastened 
<A NAME="740"></A>towards Thessaly, designing to meet him, but in his march, when near Melitea, 
<A NAME="741"></A>received advices from all parts that the countries behind him were overrun 
<A NAME="742"></A>and ravaged by no less a royal army than the former. For Dorylaus, arriving 
<A NAME="743"></A>at Chalcis with a large fleet, on board of which he brought over with him 
<A NAME="744"></A>eighty thousand of the best appointed and best disciplined soldiers of 
<A NAME="745"></A>Mithridates's army, at once invaded Boeotia, and occupied the country in 
<A NAME="746"></A>hopes to bring Sylla to a battle, making no account of the dissuasions 
<A NAME="747"></A>of Archelaus, but giving it out as to the last fight, that without treachery 
<A NAME="748"></A>so many thousand men could never have perished. Sylla, however, facing 
<A NAME="749"></A>about expeditiously, made it clear to him that Archelaus was a wise man, 
<A NAME="750"></A>and had good skill in the Roman valour; insomuch that he himself, after 
<A NAME="751"></A>some small skirmishes with Sylla near Tilphossium, was the first of those 
<A NAME="752"></A>who thought it not advisable to put things to the decision of the sword, 
<A NAME="753"></A>but rather to wear out the war by expense of time and treasure. The ground, 
<A NAME="754"></A>however, near Orchomenus, where they then lay encamped, gave some encouragement 
<A NAME="755"></A>to Archelaus, being a battlefield admirably suited for any army superior 
<A NAME="756"></A>in cavalry. Of all the plains in Boeotia that are renowned for their beauty 
<A NAME="757"></A>and extent, this alone, which commences from the city of Orchomenus, spreads 
<A NAME="758"></A>out unbroken and clear of trees to the edge of the fens in which the Melas, 
<A NAME="759"></A>rising close under Orchomenus, loses itself, the only Greek river which 
<A NAME="760"></A>is a deep and navigable water from the very head, increasing also about 
<A NAME="761"></A>the summer solstice like the Nile, and producing plants similar to those 
<A NAME="762"></A>that grow there, only small and without fruit. It does not run far before 
<A NAME="763"></A>the main stream disappears among the blind and woody marsh-grounds; a small 
<A NAME="764"></A>branch, however, joins the Cephisus, about the place where the lake is 
<A NAME="765"></A>thought to produce the best flute-reeds.
<A NAME="766"></A><BR><BR>Now that both armies were posted near each other, Archelaus lay 
<A NAME="767"></A>still, but Sylla employed himself in cutting ditches from either side; 
<A NAME="768"></A>that if possible, by driving the enemies from the firm and open champaign, 
<A NAME="769"></A>he might force them into the fens. They, on the other hand, not enduring 
<A NAME="770"></A>this, as soon as their leaders allowed them the word of command, issued 
<A NAME="771"></A>out furiously in large bodies; when not only the men at work were dispersed, 
<A NAME="772"></A>but most part of those who stood in arms to protect the work fled in disorder. 
<A NAME="773"></A>Upon this, Sylla leaped from his horse, and snatching hold of an ensign, 
<A NAME="774"></A>rushed through the midst of the rout upon the enemy, crying out aloud, 
<A NAME="775"></A>"To me, O Romans, it will be glorious to fall here. As for you, when they 
<A NAME="776"></A>ask you where you betrayed your general, remember and say, at Orchomenus." 
<A NAME="777"></A>His men rallying again at these words, and two cohorts coming to his succour 
<A NAME="778"></A>from the right wing, he led them to the charge and turned the day. Then 
<A NAME="779"></A>retiring some short distance and refreshing his men, he proceeded again 
<A NAME="780"></A>with his works to block up the enemy's camp. They again sallied out in 
<A NAME="781"></A>better order than before. Here Diogenes, stepson to Archelaus, fighting 
<A NAME="782"></A>on the right wing with much gallantry, made an honourable end. And the 
<A NAME="783"></A>archers, being hard pressed by the Romans, and wanting space for a retreat, 
<A NAME="784"></A>took their arrows by handfuls, and striking with these as with swords, 
<A NAME="785"></A>beat them back. In the end, however, they were all driven into the intrenchment 
<A NAME="786"></A>and had a sorrowful night of it with their slain and wounded. The next 
<A NAME="787"></A>day again, Sylla, leading forth his men up to their quarters, went on finishing 
<A NAME="788"></A>the lines of intrenchment, and when they issued out again with larger numbers 
<A NAME="789"></A>to give him battle, fell on them and put them to the rout, and in the consternation 
<A NAME="790"></A>ensuing, none daring to abide, he took the camp by storm. The marshes were 
<A NAME="791"></A>filled with blood, and the lake with dead bodies, insomuch that to this 
<A NAME="792"></A>day many bows, helmets, fragments of iron, breastplates, and swords of 
<A NAME="793"></A>barbarian make continue to be found buried deep in mud, two hundred years 
<A NAME="794"></A>after the fight. Thus much of the actions of Chaeronea and 
<A NAME="795"></A>Orchomenus.
<A NAME="796"></A><BR><BR>At Rome, Cinna and Carbo were now using injustice and violence 
<A NAME="797"></A>towards persons of the greatest eminence, and many of them to avoid this 
<A NAME="798"></A>tyranny repaired, as to a safe harbour, to Sylla's camp, where, in a short 
<A NAME="799"></A>space, he had about him the aspect of a senate. Metella, likewise, having 
<A NAME="800"></A>with difficulty conveyed herself and children away by stealth, brought 
<A NAME="801"></A>him word that his houses, both in town and country, had been burnt by his 
<A NAME="802"></A>enemies, and entreated his help at home. Whilst he was in doubt what to 
<A NAME="803"></A>do, being impatient to hear of his country being thus outraged, and yet 
<A NAME="804"></A>not knowing how to leave so great a work as the Mithridatic war unfinished, 
<A NAME="805"></A>there comes to him Archelaus, a merchant of Delos, with hopes of an accommodation, 
<A NAME="806"></A>and private instructions from Archelaus, the king's general. Sylla liked 
<A NAME="807"></A>the business so well as to desire a speedy conference with Archelaus in 
<A NAME="808"></A>person, and a meeting took place on the seacoast near Delium, where the 
<A NAME="809"></A>temple of Apollo stands. When Archelaus opened the conversation, and began 
<A NAME="810"></A>to urge Sylla to abandon his pretensions to Asia and Pontus, and to set 
<A NAME="811"></A>sail for the war in Rome, receiving money and shipping, and such forces 
<A NAME="812"></A>as he should think fitting from the king, Sylla interposing, bade Archelaus 
<A NAME="813"></A>take no further care for Mithridates, but assume the crown to himself, 
<A NAME="814"></A>and become a confederate of Rome, delivering up the navy. Archelaus professing 
<A NAME="815"></A>his abhorrence of such treason, Sylla proceeded: "So you, Archelaus, a 
<A NAME="816"></A>Cappadocian, and slave, or if it so please you friend, to a barbarian king, 
<A NAME="817"></A>would not, upon such vast considerations, be guilty of what is dishonourable, 
<A NAME="818"></A>and yet dare to talk to me, Roman general and Sylla, of treason? as if 
<A NAME="819"></A>you were not the self-same Archelaus who ran away at Chaeronea, with few 
<A NAME="820"></A>remaining out of one hundred and twenty thousand men; who lay for two days 
<A NAME="821"></A>in the fens of Orchomenus, and left Boeotia impassable for heaps of dead 
<A NAME="822"></A>carcasses." Archelaus, changing his tone at this, humbly besought him to 
<A NAME="823"></A>lay aside the thoughts of war, and make peace with Mithridates. Sylla consenting 
<A NAME="824"></A>to this request, articles of agreement were concluded on. That Mithridates 
<A NAME="825"></A>should quit Asia and Paphlagonia, restore Bithynia to Nicomedes, Cappadocia 
<A NAME="826"></A>to Ariobarzanes, and pay the Romans two thousand talents, and give him 
<A NAME="827"></A>seventy ships of war with all their furniture. On the other hand, that 
<A NAME="828"></A>Sylla should confirm to him his other dominions, and declare him a Roman 
<A NAME="829"></A>confederate. On these terms he proceeded by the way of Thessaly and Macedon 
<A NAME="830"></A>towards the Hellespont, having Archelaus with him, and treating him with 
<A NAME="831"></A>great attention. For Archelaus being taken dangerously ill at Larissa, 
<A NAME="832"></A>he stopped the march of the army, and took care of him, as if he had been 
<A NAME="833"></A>one of his own captains, or his colleague in command. This gave suspicion 
<A NAME="834"></A>of foul play in the battle of Chaeronea; as it was also observed that Sylla 
<A NAME="835"></A>had released all the friends of Mithridates taken prisoners in war, except 
<A NAME="836"></A>only Aristion the tyrant, who was at enmity with Archelaus, and was put 
<A NAME="837"></A>to death by poison; and, above all, ten thousand acres of land in Euboea 
<A NAME="838"></A>had been given to the Cappadocian, and he had received from Sylla the style 
<A NAME="839"></A>of friend and ally of the Romans. On all which points Sylla defends himself 
<A NAME="840"></A>in his Memoirs.
<A NAME="841"></A><BR><BR>The ambassadors of Mithridates arriving and declaring that they 
<A NAME="842"></A>accepted of the conditions, only Paphlagonia they could not part with; 
<A NAME="843"></A>and as for the ships, professing not to know of any such capitulation, 
<A NAME="844"></A>Sylla in a rage exclaimed, "What say you? Does Mithridates then withhold 
<A NAME="845"></A>Paphlagonia? and as to the ships, deny that article? I thought to have 
<A NAME="846"></A>seen him prostrate at my feet to thank me for leaving him so much as that 
<A NAME="847"></A>right hand of his, which has cut off so many Romans. He will shortly, at 
<A NAME="848"></A>my coming over into Asia, speak another language; in the meantime, let 
<A NAME="849"></A>him at his ease in Pergamus sit managing a war which he never saw." The 
<A NAME="850"></A>ambassadors in terror stood silent by, but Archelaus endeavoured with humble 
<A NAME="851"></A>supplications to assuage his wrath, laying hold on his right hand and weeping. 
<A NAME="852"></A>In conclusion he obtained permission to go himself in person to Mithridates; 
<A NAME="853"></A>for that he would either mediate a peace to the satisfaction of Sylla, 
<A NAME="854"></A>or if not, slay himself. Sylla having thus despatched him away, made an 
<A NAME="855"></A>inroad into Maedica, and after wide depopulations returned back again into 
<A NAME="856"></A>Macedon, where he received Archelaus about Philippi, bringing word that 
<A NAME="857"></A>all was well, and that Mithridates earnestly requested an interview. The 
<A NAME="858"></A>chief cause of this meeting was Fimbria; for he, having assassinated Flaccus, 
<A NAME="859"></A>the consul of the contrary faction, and worsted the Mithridatic commanders, 
<A NAME="860"></A>was advancing against Mithridates himself, who, fearing this, chose rather 
<A NAME="861"></A>to seek the friendship of Sylla.
<A NAME="862"></A><BR><BR>And so met at Dardanus in the Troad, on one side Mithridates, attended 
<A NAME="863"></A>with two hundred ships, and land-forces consisting of twenty thousand men 
<A NAME="864"></A>at arms, six thousand horse, and a large train of scythed chariots; on 
<A NAME="865"></A>the other, Sylla with only four cohorts and two hundred horse. As Mithridates 
<A NAME="866"></A>drew near and put out his hand, Sylla demanded whether he was willing or 
<A NAME="867"></A>no to end the war on the terms Archelaus had agreed to, but seeing the 
<A NAME="868"></A>king made no answer, "How is this?" he continued, "ought not the petitioner 
<A NAME="869"></A>to speak first, and the conqueror to listen in silence?" And when Mithridates, 
<A NAME="870"></A>entering upon his plea, began to shift off the war, partly on the gods, 
<A NAME="871"></A>and partly to blame the Romans themselves, he took him up, saying that 
<A NAME="872"></A>he had heard, indeed, long since from others, and now he knew it himself 
<A NAME="873"></A>for truth, that Mithridates was a powerful speaker, who in defence of the 
<A NAME="874"></A>most foul and unjust proceedings, had not wanted for specious pretences. 
<A NAME="875"></A>Then charging him with and inveighing bitterly against the outrages he 
<A NAME="876"></A>had committed, he asked again whether he was willing or no to ratify the 
<A NAME="877"></A>treaty of Archelaus? Mithridates answering in the affirmative, Sylla came 
<A NAME="878"></A>forward, embraced and kissed him. Not long after he introduced Ariobarzanes 
<A NAME="879"></A>and Nicomedes, the two kings, and made them friends. Mithridates, when 
<A NAME="880"></A>he had handed over to Sylla seventy ships and five hundred archers, set 
<A NAME="881"></A>sail for Pontus.
<A NAME="882"></A><BR><BR>Sylla, perceiving the soldiers to be dissatisfied with the peace 
<A NAME="883"></A>(as it seemed indeed a monstrous thing that they should see the king who 
<A NAME="884"></A>was their bitterest enemy, and who had caused one hundred and fifty thousand 
<A NAME="885"></A>Romans to be massacred in one day in Asia, now sailing off with the riches 
<A NAME="886"></A>and spoils of Asia, which he had pillaged, and put under contribution for 
<A NAME="887"></A>the space of four years), in his defence to them alleged, that he could 
<A NAME="888"></A>not have made head against Fimbria and Mithridates, had they both withstood 
<A NAME="889"></A>him in conjunction. Thence he set out and went in search of Fimbria, who 
<A NAME="890"></A>lay with the army about Thyatira, and pitching his camp not far off, proceeded 
<A NAME="891"></A>to fortify it with a trench. The soldiers of Fimbria came out in their 
<A NAME="892"></A>single coats, and saluting his men, lent ready assistance to the work; 
<A NAME="893"></A>which change Fimbria beholding, and apprehending Sylla as irreconcilable, 
<A NAME="894"></A>laid violent hands on himself in the camp.
<A NAME="895"></A><BR><BR>Sylla imposed on Asia in general a tax of twenty thousand talents, 
<A NAME="896"></A>and despoiled individually each family by the licentious behaviour and 
<A NAME="897"></A>long residence of the soldiery in private quarters. For he ordained that 
<A NAME="898"></A>every host should allow his guest four tetradrachms each day, and moreover 
<A NAME="899"></A>entertain him, and as many friends as he should invite, with a supper; 
<A NAME="900"></A>that a centurion should receive fifty drachms a day, together with one 
<A NAME="901"></A>suit of clothes to wear within doors, and another when he went 
<A NAME="902"></A>abroad.
<A NAME="903"></A><BR><BR>Having set out from Ephesus with the whole navy, he came the third 
<A NAME="904"></A>day to anchor in the Piraeus. Here he was initiated in the mysteries, and 
<A NAME="905"></A>seized for his use the library of Apellicon the Teian, in which were most 
<A NAME="906"></A>of the works of Theophrastus and Aristotle, then not in general circulation. 
<A NAME="907"></A>When the whole was afterwards conveyed to Rome, there, it is said, the 
<A NAME="908"></A>greater part of the collection passed through the hands of Tyrannion the 
<A NAME="909"></A>grammarian, and that Andronicus the Rhodian, having through his means the 
<A NAME="910"></A>command of numerous copies, made the treatises public, and drew up the 
<A NAME="911"></A>catalogues that are now current. The elder Peripatetics appear themselves, 
<A NAME="912"></A>indeed, to have been accomplished and learned men, but of the writings 
<A NAME="913"></A>of Aristotle and Theophrastus they had no large or exact knowledge, because 
<A NAME="914"></A>Theophrastus bequeathing his books to the heir of Neleus of Scepsis, they 
<A NAME="915"></A>came into careless and illiterate hands.
<A NAME="916"></A><BR><BR>During Sylla's stay about Athens, his feet were attacked by a heavy 
<A NAME="917"></A>benumbing pain, which Strabo calls the first inarticulate sounds of the 
<A NAME="918"></A>gout. Taking, therefore, a voyage to Aedepsus, he made use of the hot waters 
<A NAME="919"></A>there, allowing himself at the same time to forget all anxieties, and passing 
<A NAME="920"></A>away his time with actors. As he was walking along the seashore, certain 
<A NAME="921"></A>fishermen brought him some magnificent fish. Being much delighted with 
<A NAME="922"></A>the gift, and understanding, on inquiry, that they were men of Halaeae, 
<A NAME="923"></A>"What," said he, "are there any men of Halaeae surviving?" For after his 
<A NAME="924"></A>victory at Orchomenus, in the heat of a pursuit, he had destroyed three 
<A NAME="925"></A>cities of Boeotia, Anthedon, Larymna, and Halaeae. The men not knowing 
<A NAME="926"></A>what to say for fear, Sylla, with a smile, bade them cheer up and return 
<A NAME="927"></A>in peace, as they had brought with them no insignificant intercessors. 
<A NAME="928"></A>The Halaeans say that this first gave them courage to re-unite and return 
<A NAME="929"></A>to their city.
<A NAME="930"></A><BR><BR>Sylla, having marched through Thessaly and Macedon to the sea coast, 
<A NAME="931"></A>prepared, with twelve hundred vessels, to cross over from Dyrrhachium to 
<A NAME="932"></A>Brundisium. Not far from hence is Apollonia, and near it the Nymphaeum, 
<A NAME="933"></A>a spot of ground where, from among green trees and meadows, there are found 
<A NAME="934"></A>at various points springs of fire continually streaming out. Here, they 
<A NAME="935"></A>say, a satyr, such as statuaries and painters represent, was caught asleep, 
<A NAME="936"></A>and brought before Sylla, where he was asked by several interpreters who 
<A NAME="937"></A>he was, and, after much trouble, at last uttered nothing intelligible, 
<A NAME="938"></A>but a harsh noise, something between the neighing of a horse and crying 
<A NAME="939"></A>of a goat. Sylla, in dismay, and deprecating such an omen, bade it be 
<A NAME="940"></A>removed.
<A NAME="941"></A><BR><BR>At the point of transportation, Sylla being in alarm, lest at their 
<A NAME="942"></A>first setting foot upon Italy the soldiers should disband and disperse 
<A NAME="943"></A>one by one among the cities, they of their own accord first took an oath 
<A NAME="944"></A>to stand firm by him, and not of their good-will to injure Italy; then 
<A NAME="945"></A>seeing him in distress for money, they made, so they say, a free-will offering, 
<A NAME="946"></A>and contributed each man according to his ability. However, Sylla would 
<A NAME="947"></A>not accept of their offering, but praising their good-will, and arousing 
<A NAME="948"></A>up their courage, went over (as he himself writes) against fifteen hostile 
<A NAME="949"></A>generals in command of four hundred and fifty cohorts; but not without 
<A NAME="950"></A>the most unmistakable divine intimations of his approaching happy successes. 
<A NAME="951"></A>For when he was sacrificing at his first landing near Tarentum, the victim's 
<A NAME="952"></A>liver showed the figure of a crown of laurel with two fillets hanging from 
<A NAME="953"></A>it. And a little while before his arrival in Campania, near the mountain 
<A NAME="954"></A>Hephaeus, two stately goats were seen in the daytime, fighting together, 
<A NAME="955"></A>and performing all the motions of men in battle. It proved to be an apparition, 
<A NAME="956"></A>and rising up gradually from the ground, dispersed in the air, like fancied 
<A NAME="957"></A>representations in the clouds, and so vanished out of sight. Not long after, 
<A NAME="958"></A>in the self-same place, when Marius the younger and Norbanus the consul 
<A NAME="959"></A>attacked him with two great armies, without prescribing the order of battle, 
<A NAME="960"></A>or arranging his men according to their divisions, by the sway only of 
<A NAME="961"></A>one common alacrity and transport of courage, he overthrew the enemy, and 
<A NAME="962"></A>shut up Norbanus into the city of Capua, with the loss of seven thousand 
<A NAME="963"></A>of his men. And this was the reason, he says, that the soldiers did not 
<A NAME="964"></A>leave him and disperse into the different towns, but held fast to him, 
<A NAME="965"></A>and despised the enemy, though infinitely more in number.
<A NAME="966"></A><BR><BR>At Silvium (as he himself relates it), there met him a servant 
<A NAME="967"></A>of Pontius, in a state of divine possession, saying that he brought him 
<A NAME="968"></A>the power of the sword and victory from Bellona, the goddess of war, and 
<A NAME="969"></A>if he did not make haste, that the capitol would be burnt, which fell out 
<A NAME="970"></A>on the same day the man foretold it, namely, on the sixth day of the month 
<A NAME="971"></A>Quintilis, which we now call July.
<A NAME="972"></A><BR><BR>At Fidentia, also, Marcus Lucullus, one of Sylla's commanders, 
<A NAME="973"></A>reposed such confidence in the forwardness of the soldiers, as to dare 
<A NAME="974"></A>to face fifty cohorts of the enemy with only sixteen of his own: but because 
<A NAME="975"></A>many of them were unarmed delayed the onset. As he stood thus waiting, 
<A NAME="976"></A>and considering with himself, a gentle gale of wind, bearing along with 
<A NAME="977"></A>it from the neighbouring meadows a quantity of flowers, scattered them 
<A NAME="978"></A>down upon the army, on whose shields and helmets they settled, and arranged 
<A NAME="979"></A>themselves spontaneously so as to give the soldiers, in the eyes of the 
<A NAME="980"></A>enemy, the appearance of being crowned with chaplets. Upon this, being 
<A NAME="981"></A>yet further animated, they joined battle, and victoriously slaying eight 
<A NAME="982"></A>thousand men, took the camp. This Lucullus was brother to that Lucullus 
<A NAME="983"></A>who in aftertimes conquered Mithridates and Tigranes.
<A NAME="984"></A><BR><BR>Sylla, seeing himself still surrounded by so many armies, and such 
<A NAME="985"></A>mighty hostile powers, had recourse to art, inviting Scipio, the other 
<A NAME="986"></A>consul, to a treaty of peace. The motion was willingly embraced, and several 
<A NAME="987"></A>meetings and consultations ensued, in all which Sylla, still interposing 
<A NAME="988"></A>matter of delay and new pretences, in the meanwhile, debauched Scipio's 
<A NAME="989"></A>men by means of his own, who were as well practised as the general himself 
<A NAME="990"></A>in all the artifices of inveigling. For entering into the enemy's quarters 
<A NAME="991"></A>and joining in conversation, they gained some by present money, some by 
<A NAME="992"></A>promises, others by fair words and persuasions; so that in the end, when 
<A NAME="993"></A>Sylla with twenty cohorts drew near, on his men saluting Scipio's soldiers, 
<A NAME="994"></A>they returned the greeting and came over, leaving Scipio behind them in 
<A NAME="995"></A>his tent, where he was found all alone and dismissed. And having used his 
<A NAME="996"></A>twenty cohorts as decoys to ensnare the forty of the enemy, he led them 
<A NAME="997"></A>all back into the camp. On this occasion, Carbo was heard to say that he 
<A NAME="998"></A>had both a fox and a lion in the breast of Sylla to deal with, and was 
<A NAME="999"></A>most troubled with the fox.
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR><BR>Some time after, at Signia, Marius the younger, with eighty-five 
<A NAME="1001"></A>cohorts, offered battle to Sylla, who was extremely desirous to have it 
<A NAME="1002"></A>decided on that very day; for the night before he had seen a vision in 
<A NAME="1003"></A>his sleep, of Marius the elder, who had been some time dead, advising his 
<A NAME="1004"></A>son to beware of the following day, as of fatal consequence to him. For 
<A NAME="1005"></A>this reason, Sylla, longing to come to a battle, sent off for Dolabella, 
<A NAME="1006"></A>who lay encamped at some distance. But because the enemy had beset and 
<A NAME="1007"></A>blocked up the passes, his soldiers got tired with skirmishing and marching 
<A NAME="1008"></A>at once. To these difficulties was added, moreover, tempestuous rainy weather, 
<A NAME="1009"></A>which distressed them most of all. The principal officers therefore came 
<A NAME="1010"></A>to Sylla, and besought him to defer the battle that day, showing him how 
<A NAME="1011"></A>the soldiers lay stretched on the ground, where they had thrown themselves 
<A NAME="1012"></A>down in their weariness, resting their heads upon their shields to gain 
<A NAME="1013"></A>some repose. When, with much reluctance, he had yielded, and given orders 
<A NAME="1014"></A>for pitching the camp, they had no sooner begun to cast up the rampart 
<A NAME="1015"></A>and draw the ditch, but Marius came riding up furiously at the head of 
<A NAME="1016"></A>his troops, in hopes to scatter them in that disorder and confusion. Here 
<A NAME="1017"></A>the gods fulfilled Sylla's dream. For the soldiers, stirred up with anger, 
<A NAME="1018"></A>left off their work, and sticking their javelins into the bank, with drawn 
<A NAME="1019"></A>swords and a courageous shout, came to blows with the enemy, who made but 
<A NAME="1020"></A>small resistance, and lost great numbers in the flight. Marius fled to 
<A NAME="1021"></A>Praeneste, but finding the gates shut, tied himself round by a rope that 
<A NAME="1022"></A>was thrown down to him, and was taken up on the walls. Some there are (as 
<A NAME="1023"></A>Fenestella for one) who affirm that Marius knew nothing of the fight, but, 
<A NAME="1024"></A>overwatched and spent with hard duty, had reposed himself, when the signal 
<A NAME="1025"></A>was given, beneath some shade, and was hardly to be awakened at the flight 
<A NAME="1026"></A>of his men. Sylla, according to his own account, lost only twenty-three 
<A NAME="1027"></A>men in this fight, having killed of the enemy twenty thousand, and taken 
<A NAME="1028"></A>alive eight thousand.
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR><BR>The like success attended his lieutenants, Pompey, Crassus, Metellus, 
<A NAME="1030"></A>Servilius, who with little or no loss cut off vast numbers of the enemy, 
<A NAME="1031"></A>insomuch that Carbo, the prime supporter of the cause, fled by night from 
<A NAME="1032"></A>his charge of the army, and sailed over into Libya. In the last struggle, 
<A NAME="1033"></A>however, the Samnite Telesinus, like some champion, whose lot it is to 
<A NAME="1034"></A>enter last of all into the lists and take up the wearied conqueror, came 
<A NAME="1035"></A>nigh to have foiled and overthrown Sylla before the gates of Rome. For 
<A NAME="1036"></A>Telesinus with his second, Lamponius the Lucanian, having collected a large 
<A NAME="1037"></A>force, had been hastening towards Praeneste, to relieve Marius from the 
<A NAME="1038"></A>siege; but perceiving Sylla ahead of him, and Pompey behind, both hurrying 
<A NAME="1039"></A>up against him, straitened thus before and behind, as a valiant and experienced 
<A NAME="1040"></A>soldier, he arose by night, and marching directly with his whole army, 
<A NAME="1041"></A>was within a little of making his way unexpectedly into Rome itself. He 
<A NAME="1042"></A>lay that night before the city, at ten furlongs' distance from the Colline 
<A NAME="1043"></A>gate, elated and full of hope at having thus out-generalled so many eminent 
<A NAME="1044"></A>commanders. At break of day, being charged by the noble youth of the city, 
<A NAME="1045"></A>among many others he overthrew Appius Claudius, renowned for high birth 
<A NAME="1046"></A>and character. The city, as is easy to imagine, was all in an uproar, the 
<A NAME="1047"></A>women shrieking and running about, as if it had already been entered forcibly 
<A NAME="1048"></A>by assault, till at last Balbus, sent forward by Sylla, was seen riding 
<A NAME="1049"></A>up with seven hundred horse at full speed. Halting only long enough to 
<A NAME="1050"></A>wipe the sweat from the horses, and then hastily bridling again, he at 
<A NAME="1051"></A>once attacked the enemy. Presently Sylla himself appeared, and commanding 
<A NAME="1052"></A>those who were foremost to take immediate refreshment, proceeded to form 
<A NAME="1053"></A>in order for battle. Dolabella and Torquatus were extremely earnest with 
<A NAME="1054"></A>him to desist awhile, and not with spent forces to hazard the last hope, 
<A NAME="1055"></A>having before them in the field, not Carbo or Marius, but two warlike nations 
<A NAME="1056"></A>bearing immortal hatred to Rome, the Samnites and Lucanians, to grapple 
<A NAME="1057"></A>with. But he put them by, and commanded the trumpets to sound a charge, 
<A NAME="1058"></A>when it was now about four o'clock in the afternoon. In the conflict which 
<A NAME="1059"></A>followed, as sharp a one as ever was, the right wing where Crassus was 
<A NAME="1060"></A>posted had clearly the advantage; the left suffered and was in distress, 
<A NAME="1061"></A>when Sylla came to its succour, mounted on a white courser, full of mettle 
<A NAME="1062"></A>and exceedingly swift, which two of the enemy knowing him by, had their 
<A NAME="1063"></A>lances ready to throw at him; he himself observed nothing, but his attendant 
<A NAME="1064"></A>behind him giving the horse a touch, he was, unknown to himself, just so 
<A NAME="1065"></A>far carried forward that the points, falling beside the horse's tail, stuck 
<A NAME="1066"></A>in the ground. There is a story that he had a small golden image of Apollo 
<A NAME="1067"></A>from Delphi, which he was always wont in battle to carry about him in his 
<A NAME="1068"></A>bosom, and that he then kissed it with these words, "O Apollo Pythius, 
<A NAME="1069"></A>who in so many battles hast raised to honour and greatness the Fortunate 
<A NAME="1070"></A>Cornelius Sylla, wilt thou now cast him down, bringing him before the gate 
<A NAME="1071"></A>of his country, to perish shamefully with his fellow-citizens?" Thus, they 
<A NAME="1072"></A>say, addressing himself to the god, he entreated some of his men, threatened 
<A NAME="1073"></A>some, and seized others with his hand, till at length the left wing being 
<A NAME="1074"></A>wholly shattered, he was forced, in the general rout, to betake himself 
<A NAME="1075"></A>to the camp, having lost many of his friends and acquaintance. Many, likewise, 
<A NAME="1076"></A>of the city spectators, who had come out, were killed or trodden under 
<A NAME="1077"></A>foot. So that it was generally believed in the city that all was lost, 
<A NAME="1078"></A>and the siege of Praeneste was all but raised; many fugitives from the 
<A NAME="1079"></A>battle making their way thither, and urging Lucretius Ofella, who was appointed 
<A NAME="1080"></A>to keep on the siege, to rise in all haste, for that Sylla had perished, 
<A NAME="1081"></A>and Rome fallen into the hands of the enemy.
