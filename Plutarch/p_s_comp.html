<A NAME="1"></A><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>The Comparison of Poplicola with Solon</B></FONT>
<A NAME="2"></A><BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>There is something singular in the present parallel which has not occurred 
<A NAME="11"></A>in any other of the lives; that the one should be the imitator of the other, 
<A NAME="12"></A>and the other his best evidence. Upon the survey of Solon's sentence to 
<A NAME="13"></A>Croesus in favour of Tellus's happiness, it seems more applicable to Poplicola; 
<A NAME="14"></A>for Tellus, whose virtuous life and dying well had gained him the name 
<A NAME="15"></A>of the happiest man, yet was never celebrated in Solon's poems for a good 
<A NAME="16"></A>man, nor have his children or any magistracy of his deserved a memorial; 
<A NAME="17"></A>but Poplicola's life was the most eminent amongst the Romans, as well for 
<A NAME="18"></A>the greatness of his virtue as his power, and also since his death many 
<A NAME="19"></A>amongst the distinguished families, even in our days, the Poplicolae, Messalae, 
<A NAME="20"></A>and Valerii, after a lapse of six hundred years, acknowledge him as the 
<A NAME="21"></A>fountain of their honour. Besides, Tellus, though keeping his post and 
<A NAME="22"></A>fighting like a valiant soldier, was yet slain by his enemies; but Poplicola, 
<A NAME="23"></A>the better fortune, slew his, and saw his country victorious under his 
<A NAME="24"></A>command. And his honours and triumphs brought him, which was Solon's ambition, 
<A NAME="25"></A>to a happy end; the ejaculation which, in his verses against Mimnermus 
<A NAME="26"></A>about the continuance of man's life, he himself made-
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR>"Mourned let me die; and may I, when life ends,
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>Occasion sighs and sorrows to my friends," is evidence to Poplicola's 
<A NAME="29"></A>happiness; his death did not only draw tears from his friends and acquaintance, 
<A NAME="30"></A>but was the object of universal regret and sorrow through the whole city, 
<A NAME="31"></A>the women deplored his loss as that of a son, brother, or common father. 
<A NAME="32"></A>"Wealth I would have," said Solon, "but wealth by wrong procure would not," 
<A NAME="33"></A>because punishment would follow. But Poplicola's riches were not only justly 
<A NAME="34"></A>his, but he spent them nobly in doing good to the distressed. So that if 
<A NAME="35"></A>Solon was reputed the wisest man, we must allow Poplicola to be the happiest; 
<A NAME="36"></A>for what Solon wished for as the greatest and most perfect good, this Poplicola 
<A NAME="37"></A>had, and used and enjoyed to his death.
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR>And as Solon may thus be said to have contributed to Poplicola's 
<A NAME="39"></A>glory, so did also Poplicola to his, by his choice of him as his model 
<A NAME="40"></A>in the formation of republican institutions; in reducing, for example, 
<A NAME="41"></A>the excessive powers and assumption of the consulship. Several of his laws, 
<A NAME="42"></A>indeed, he actually transferred to Rome, as his empowering the people to 
<A NAME="43"></A>elect their officers, and allowing offenders the liberty of appealing to 
<A NAME="44"></A>the people, as Solon did to the jurors. He did not, indeed, create a new 
<A NAME="45"></A>senate, as Solon did, but augmented the old to almost double its number. 
<A NAME="46"></A>The appointment of treasurers again, the quaestors, has a like origin; 
<A NAME="47"></A>with the intent that the chief magistrate should not, if of good character, 
<A NAME="48"></A>be withdrawn from greater matters; or, if bad, have the greater temptation 
<A NAME="49"></A>to injustice, by holding both the government and treasury in his hands. 
<A NAME="50"></A>The aversion to tyranny was stronger in Poplicola; any one who attempted 
<A NAME="51"></A>usurpation could, by Solon's law, only be punished upon conviction; but 
<A NAME="52"></A>Poplicola made it death before a trial. And though Solon justly gloried, 
<A NAME="53"></A>that, when arbitrary power was absolutely offered to him by circumstances, 
<A NAME="54"></A>and when his countrymen would have willingly seen him accept it, he yet 
<A NAME="55"></A>declined it; still Poplicola merited no less, who, receiving a despotic 
<A NAME="56"></A>command, converted it to a popular office, and did not employ the whole 
<A NAME="57"></A>legal power which he held. We must allow, indeed, that Solon was before 
<A NAME="58"></A>Poplicola in observing that-
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR>"A people always minds its rulers best
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>When it is neither humoured nor oppressed."
<A NAME="61"></A><BR><BR>The remission of debts was peculiar to Solon; it was his great 
<A NAME="62"></A>means for confirming the citizens' liberty; for a mere law to give all 
<A NAME="63"></A>men equal rights is but useless, if the poor must sacrifice those rights 
<A NAME="64"></A>to their debts, and, in the very seats and sanctuaries of equality, the 
<A NAME="65"></A>courts of justice, the offices of state, and the public discussions, be 
<A NAME="66"></A>more than anywhere at the beck and bidding of the rich. A yet more extraordinary 
<A NAME="67"></A>success was, that, although usually civil violence is caused by any remission 
<A NAME="68"></A>of debts, upon this one occasion this dangerous but powerful remedy actually 
<A NAME="69"></A>put an end to the civil violence already existing, Solon's own private 
<A NAME="70"></A>worth and reputation overbalancing all the ordinary ill-repute and discredit 
<A NAME="71"></A>of the change. The beginning of his government was more glorious, for he 
<A NAME="72"></A>was entirely original, and followed no man's example, and, without the 
<A NAME="73"></A>aid of any ally, achieved his most important measures by his own conduct; 
<A NAME="74"></A>yet the close of Poplicola's life was more happy and desirable, for Solon 
<A NAME="75"></A>saw the dissolution of his own commonwealth, Poplicola maintained the state 
<A NAME="76"></A>in good order to the civil wars. Solon, leaving his laws, as soon as he 
<A NAME="77"></A>had made them, engraved in wood, but destitute of a defender, departed 
<A NAME="78"></A>from Athens; whilst Poplicola, remaining both in and out of office, laboured 
<A NAME="79"></A>to establish the government. Solon, though he actually knew of Pisistratus's 
<A NAME="80"></A>ambition, yet was not able to suppress it, but had to yield to usurpation 
<A NAME="81"></A>in its infancy; whereas Poplicola utterly subverted and dissolved a potent 
<A NAME="82"></A>monarchy, strongly settled by long continuance; uniting thus to virtues 
<A NAME="83"></A>equal to those, and purposes identical with those of Solon, the good fortune 
<A NAME="84"></A>and the power that alone could make them effective.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>In military exploits, Daimachus of Plataea will not even allow 
<A NAME="86"></A>Solon the conduct of the war against the Megarians, as was before intimated; 
<A NAME="87"></A>but Poplicola was victorious in the most important conflicts, both as a 
<A NAME="88"></A>private soldier and commander. In domestic politics, also, Solon, in play, 
<A NAME="89"></A>as it were, and by counterfeiting madness induced the enterprise against 
<A NAME="90"></A>Salamis; whereas Poplicola, in the very beginning, exposed himself to the 
<A NAME="91"></A>greatest risk, took arms against Tarquin, detected the conspiracy, and, 
<A NAME="92"></A>being principally concerned both in preventing the escape of and afterwards 
<A NAME="93"></A>punishing the traitors, not only expelled the tyrants from the city, but 
<A NAME="94"></A>extirpated their very hopes. And as, in cases calling for contest and resistance 
<A NAME="95"></A>and manful opposition, he behaved with courage and resolution, so, in instances 
<A NAME="96"></A>where peaceable language, persuasion, and concession were requisite, he 
<A NAME="97"></A>was yet more to be commended; and succeeded in gaining happily to reconciliation 
<A NAME="98"></A>and friendship, Porsenna, a terrible and invincible enemy. Some may, perhaps, 
<A NAME="99"></A>object that Solon recovered Salamis, which they had lost, for the Athenians; 
<A NAME="100"></A>whereas Poplicola receded from part of what the Romans were at that time 
<A NAME="101"></A>possessed of; but judgment is to be made of actions according to the times 
<A NAME="102"></A>in which they were performed. The conduct of a wise politician is ever 
<A NAME="103"></A>suited to the present posture of affairs; often by foregoing a part he 
<A NAME="104"></A>saves the whole, and by yielding in a small matter secures a greater; and 
<A NAME="105"></A>so Poplicola, by restoring what the Romans had lately usurped, saved their 
<A NAME="106"></A>undoubted patrimony, and procured, moreover, the stores of the enemy for 
<A NAME="107"></A>those who were only too thankful to secure their city. Permitting the decision 
<A NAME="108"></A>of the controversy to his adversary, he not only got the victory, but likewise 
<A NAME="109"></A>what he himself would willingly have given to purchase the victory, Porsenna 
<A NAME="110"></A>putting an end to the war, and leaving them all the provision of his camp, 
<A NAME="111"></A>from the sense of the virtue and gallant disposition of the Romans which 
<A NAME="112"></A>their consul had impressed upon him.
