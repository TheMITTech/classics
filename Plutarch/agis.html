<BR>(died 241 B.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>The fable of Ixion, who, embracing a cloud instead of Juno, begot the Centaurs, 
<A NAME="11"></A>has been ingeniously enough supposed to have been invented to represent 
<A NAME="12"></A>to us ambitious men, whose minds, doting on glory, which is a mere image 
<A NAME="13"></A>of virtue, produce nothing that is genuine or uniform, but only, as might 
<A NAME="14"></A>be expected of such a conjunction, misshapen and unnatural actions. Running 
<A NAME="15"></A>after their emulations and passions, and carried away by the impulses of 
<A NAME="16"></A>the moment, they may say with the herdsmen in the tragedy of 
<A NAME="17"></A>Sophocles-
<A NAME="18"></A><BR><BR>"We follow these, though born their rightful 
<A NAME="19"></A>lords,
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>And they command us, though they speak no words." For this is indeed 
<A NAME="21"></A>the true condition of men in public life, who, to gain the vain title of 
<A NAME="22"></A>being the people's leaders and governors, are content to make themselves 
<A NAME="23"></A>the slaves and followers of all the people's humours and caprices. For 
<A NAME="24"></A>as the lookout men at the ship's prow, though they see what is ahead before 
<A NAME="25"></A>the men at the helm, yet constantly look back to the pilots there, and 
<A NAME="26"></A>obey the orders they give; so these men, steered, as I may say, by popular 
<A NAME="27"></A>applause, though they bear the name of governors, are in reality the mere 
<A NAME="28"></A>underlings of the multitude. The man who is completely wise and virtuous 
<A NAME="29"></A>has no need at all of glory, except so far as it disposes and eases his 
<A NAME="30"></A>way to action by the greater trust that it procures him. A young man, I 
<A NAME="31"></A>grant, may be permitted, while yet eager for distinction, to pride himself 
<A NAME="32"></A>a little in his good deeds; for (as Theophrastus says) his virtues, which 
<A NAME="33"></A>are yet tender and, as it were, in the blade, cherished and supported by 
<A NAME="34"></A>praises, grow stronger, and take the deeper root. But when this passion 
<A NAME="35"></A>is exorbitant, it is dangerous in all men, and in those who govern a commonwealth, 
<A NAME="36"></A>utterly destructive. For in the possession of large power and authority, 
<A NAME="37"></A>it transports men to a degree of madness; so that now they no more think 
<A NAME="38"></A>what is good, glorious, but will have those actions only esteemed good 
<A NAME="39"></A>that are glorious. As Phocion, therefore, answered King Antipater, who 
<A NAME="40"></A>sought his approbation of some unworthy action, "I cannot be your flatterer, 
<A NAME="41"></A>and your friend," so these men should answer the people, "I cannot govern 
<A NAME="42"></A>and obey you." For it may happen to the commonwealth, as to the serpent 
<A NAME="43"></A>in the fable, whose tail, rising in rebellion against the head, complained, 
<A NAME="44"></A>as of a great grievance, that it was always forced to follow, and required 
<A NAME="45"></A>that it should be permitted by turns to lead the way. And taking the command 
<A NAME="46"></A>accordingly, it soon inflicted, by its senseless courses, mischiefs in 
<A NAME="47"></A>abundance upon itself, while the head was torn and lacerated with following, 
<A NAME="48"></A>contrary to nature, a guide that was deaf and blind. And such we see to 
<A NAME="49"></A>have been the lot of many, who, submitting to be guided by the inclinations 
<A NAME="50"></A>of an uninformed and unreasoning multitude, could neither stop, nor recover 
<A NAME="51"></A>themselves out of the confusion.
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR>This is what has occurred to us to say of that glory which depends 
<A NAME="53"></A>on the voice of large numbers, considering the sad effects of it in the 
<A NAME="54"></A>misfortunes of Caius and Tiberius Gracchus, men of noble nature, and whose 
<A NAME="55"></A>generous natural dispositions were improved by the best of educations, 
<A NAME="56"></A>and who came to the administration of affairs with the most laudable intentions; 
<A NAME="57"></A>yet they were ruined, I cannot say by an immoderate desire of glory, but 
<A NAME="58"></A>by a more excusable fear of disgrace. For being excessively beloved and 
<A NAME="59"></A>favoured by the people, they thought it a discredit to them not to make 
<A NAME="60"></A>full repayment, endeavouring by new public acts to outdo the honours they 
<A NAME="61"></A>had received, and again, because of these new kindnesses, incurring yet 
<A NAME="62"></A>further distinctions; till the people and they, mutually inflamed, and 
<A NAME="63"></A>vying thus with each other in honours and benefits, brought things at last 
<A NAME="64"></A>to such a pass that they might say that to engage so far was indeed a folly, 
<A NAME="65"></A>but to retreat would now be a shame.
<A NAME="66"></A><BR><BR>This the reader will easily gather from the story. I will now compare 
<A NAME="67"></A>with them two Lacedaemonian popular leaders, the kings Agis and Cleomenes. 
<A NAME="68"></A>For they, being desirous also to raise the people, and to restore the noble 
<A NAME="69"></A>and just form of government, now long fallen into disuse, incurred the 
<A NAME="70"></A>hatred of the rich and powerful, who could not endure to be deprived of 
<A NAME="71"></A>the selfish enjoyment to which they were accustomed. These were not indeed 
<A NAME="72"></A>brothers by nature, as the two Romans, but they had a kind of brotherly 
<A NAME="73"></A>resemblance in their actions and designs, which took a rise from such beginnings 
<A NAME="74"></A>and occasions as I am now about to relate.
<A NAME="75"></A><BR><BR>When the love of gold and silver had once gained admittance into 
<A NAME="76"></A>the Lacedaemonian commonwealth, it was quickly followed by avarice and 
<A NAME="77"></A>baseness of spirit in the pursuit of it, and by luxury, effeminacy, and 
<A NAME="78"></A>prodigality in the use. Then Sparta fell from almost all her former virtue 
<A NAME="79"></A>and repute, and so continued till the days of Agis and Leonidas, who both 
<A NAME="80"></A>together were kings of the Lacedaemonians.
<A NAME="81"></A><BR><BR>Agis was of the royal family of Eurypon, son of Eudamidas, and 
<A NAME="82"></A>the sixth in descent from Agesilaus, who made the expedition into Asia, 
<A NAME="83"></A>and was the greatest man of his time in Greece. Agesilaus left behind him 
<A NAME="84"></A>a son called Archidamus, the same who was slain at Mandonium, in Italy, 
<A NAME="85"></A>by the Messapians, and who was then succeeded by his eldest son Agis. He 
<A NAME="86"></A>being killed by Antipater near Megalopolis, and leaving no issue, was succeeded 
<A NAME="87"></A>by his brother Eudamidas; he by a son called Archidamus; and Archidamus 
<A NAME="88"></A>by another Eudamidas, the father of this Agis of whom we now 
<A NAME="89"></A>treat.
<A NAME="90"></A><BR><BR>Leonidas, son of Cleonymus, was of the other royal house of the 
<A NAME="91"></A>Agiadae, and the eighth in descent from Pausanias, who defeated Mardonius 
<A NAME="92"></A>in the battle of Plataea. Pausanias was succeeded by a son called Plistoanax; 
<A NAME="93"></A>and he by another Pausanias who was banished, and lived as a private man 
<A NAME="94"></A>at Tegea, while his eldest son, Agesipolis, reigned in his place. He, dying 
<A NAME="95"></A>without issue, was succeeded by a younger brother, called Cleombrotus, 
<A NAME="96"></A>who left two sons; the elder was Agesipolis, who reigned but a short time, 
<A NAME="97"></A>and died without issue; the younger, who then became king, was called Cleomenes, 
<A NAME="98"></A>and had also two sons, Acrotatus and Cleonymus. The first died before his 
<A NAME="99"></A>father, but left a son called Areus, who succeeded, and being slain at 
<A NAME="100"></A>Corinth, left the kingdom to his son Acrotatus. This Acrotatus was defeated, 
<A NAME="101"></A>and slain near Megalopolis, in a battle against the tyrant Aristodemus; 
<A NAME="102"></A>he left his wife big with child, and on her being delivered of a son, Leonidas, 
<A NAME="103"></A>son of the above-named Cleonymus, was made his guardian, and as the young 
<A NAME="104"></A>king died before becoming a man, he succeeded in the 
<A NAME="105"></A>kingdom.
<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR>Leonidas was a king not particularly suitable to his people. For 
<A NAME="107"></A>though there were at that time at Sparta a general decline in manners, 
<A NAME="108"></A>yet a greater revolt from the old habits appeared in him than in others. 
<A NAME="109"></A>For having lived a long time among the great lords of Persia, and been 
<A NAME="110"></A>a follower of King Seleucus, he unadvisedly thought to imitate, among Greek 
<A NAME="111"></A>institutions and in a lawful government, the pride and assumption usual 
<A NAME="112"></A>in those courts. Agis, on the contrary, in fineness of nature and elevation 
<A NAME="113"></A>of mind, not only far excelled Leonidas, but in a manner all the kings 
<A NAME="114"></A>that had reigned since the great Agesilaus. For though he had been bred 
<A NAME="115"></A>very tenderly, in abundance and even in luxury, by his mother Agesistrata 
<A NAME="116"></A>and his grandmother Archidamia, who were the wealthiest of the Lacedaemonians, 
<A NAME="117"></A>yet, before the age of twenty, he renounced all indulgence in pleasures. 
<A NAME="118"></A>Withdrawing himself as far as possible from the gaiety and ornament which 
<A NAME="119"></A>seemed becoming to the grace of his person, he made it his pride to appear 
<A NAME="120"></A>in the coarse Spartan coat. In his meals, his bathings, and in all his 
<A NAME="121"></A>exercises, he followed the old Laconian usage, and was often heard to say, 
<A NAME="122"></A>he had no desire for the place of king, if he did not hope by means of 
<A NAME="123"></A>that authority to restore their ancient laws and discipline.
<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR>The Lacedaemonians might date the beginning of their corruption 
<A NAME="125"></A>from their conquest of Athens, and the influx of gold and silver among 
<A NAME="126"></A>them that thence ensued. Yet, nevertheless, the number of houses which 
<A NAME="127"></A>Lycurgus appointed being still maintained, and the law remaining in force 
<A NAME="128"></A>by which every one was obliged to leave his lot or portion of land entirely 
<A NAME="129"></A>to his son, a kind of order and equality was thereby preserved, which still 
<A NAME="130"></A>in some degree sustained the state amidst its errors in other respects. 
<A NAME="131"></A>But one Epitadeus happening to be ephor, a man of great influence, and 
<A NAME="132"></A>of a willful, violent spirit, on some occasion of a quarrel with his son, 
<A NAME="133"></A>proposed a decree, that all men should have liberty to dispose of their 
<A NAME="134"></A>land by gift in their lifetime, or by their last will and testament. This 
<A NAME="135"></A>being promoted by him to satisfy a passion of revenge, and through covetousness 
<A NAME="136"></A>consented to by others, and thus enacted for a law, was the ruin of the 
<A NAME="137"></A>best state of the commonwealth. For the rich men without scruple drew the 
<A NAME="138"></A>estate into their own hands, excluding the rightful heirs from their succession; 
<A NAME="139"></A>and all the wealth being centered upon the few, the generality were poor 
<A NAME="140"></A>and miserable. Honorable pursuits, for which there was no longer leisure, 
<A NAME="141"></A>were neglected; the state was filled with sordid business, and with hatred 
<A NAME="142"></A>and envy of the rich. There did not remain above seven hundred of the old 
<A NAME="143"></A>Spartan families, of which, perhaps, one hundred might have estate in land, 
<A NAME="144"></A>the rest were destitute alike of wealth and of honour, were tardy and unperforming 
<A NAME="145"></A>in the defence of their country against its enemies abroad, and eagerly 
<A NAME="146"></A>watched the opportunity for change and revolution at 
<A NAME="147"></A>home.
<A NAME="148"></A><BR><BR>Agis, therefore, believing it a glorious action, as in truth it 
<A NAME="149"></A>was, to equalize and repeople the state, began to sound the inclinations 
<A NAME="150"></A>of the citizens. He found the young men disposed beyond his expectation; 
<A NAME="151"></A>they were eager to enter with him upon the contest in the cause of virtue, 
<A NAME="152"></A>and to fling aside, for freedom's sake, their old manner of life, as readily 
<A NAME="153"></A>as the wrestler does his garment. But the old men, habituated and more 
<A NAME="154"></A>confirmed in their vices, were most of them as alarmed at the very name 
<A NAME="155"></A>of Lycurgus, as a fugitive slave to be brought back before his offended 
<A NAME="156"></A>master. These men could not endure to hear Agis continually deploring the 
<A NAME="157"></A>present state of Sparta, and wishing she might be restored to her ancient 
<A NAME="158"></A>glory. But on the other side, Lysander, the son of Libys, Mandroclidas, 
<A NAME="159"></A>the son of Ecphanes, together with Agesilaus, not only approved his design, 
<A NAME="160"></A>but assisted and confirmed him in it. Lysander had a great authority and 
<A NAME="161"></A>credit with the people; Mandroclidas was esteemed the ablest Greek of his 
<A NAME="162"></A>time to manage an affair and put it in train, and, joined with skill and 
<A NAME="163"></A>cunning, had a great degree of boldness. Agesilaus was the king's uncle, 
<A NAME="164"></A>by the mother's side; an eloquent man, but covetous and voluptuous, who 
<A NAME="165"></A>was not moved by considerations of public good, but rather seemed to be 
<A NAME="166"></A>persuaded in it by his son Hippomedon, whose courage and signal actions 
<A NAME="167"></A>in war had gained him a high esteem and great influence among the young 
<A NAME="168"></A>men of Sparta, though indeed the true motive was, that he had many debts, 
<A NAME="169"></A>and hoped by this means to be freed from them.
<A NAME="170"></A><BR><BR>As soon as Agis had prevailed with his uncle, he endeavoured by 
<A NAME="171"></A>his mediation to gain his mother also, who had many friends and followers, 
<A NAME="172"></A>and a number of persons in her debt in the city, and took a considerable 
<A NAME="173"></A>part in public affairs. At the first proposal she was very averse, and 
<A NAME="174"></A>strongly advised her son not to engage in so difficult and so unprofitable 
<A NAME="175"></A>an enterprise. But Agesilaus endeavoured to possess her, that the thing 
<A NAME="176"></A>was not so difficult as she imagined, and that it might, in all likelihood, 
<A NAME="177"></A>redound to the advantage of her family; while the king, her son, besought 
<A NAME="178"></A>her not for money's sake to decline assisting his hopes of glory. He told 
<A NAME="179"></A>her he could not pretend to equal other kings in riches, the very followers 
<A NAME="180"></A>and menials of the satraps and stewards of Seleucus or Ptolemy abounding 
<A NAME="181"></A>more in wealth than all the Spartan kings put together; but if by contempt 
<A NAME="182"></A>of wealth and pleasure, by simplicity and magnanimity, he could surpass 
<A NAME="183"></A>their luxury and abundance; if he could restore their former equality to 
<A NAME="184"></A>the Spartans, then he should be a great king indeed. In conclusion, the 
<A NAME="185"></A>mother and the grandmother also were so taken, so carried away with the 
<A NAME="186"></A>inspiration, as it were, of the young man's noble and generous ambition, 
<A NAME="187"></A>that they not only consented, but were ready on all occasions to spur him 
<A NAME="188"></A>on to a perseverance, and not only sent to speak on his behalf with the 
<A NAME="189"></A>men with whom they had an interest, but addressed the other women also, 
<A NAME="190"></A>knowing well that the Lacedaemonian wives had always a great power with 
<A NAME="191"></A>their husbands, who used to impart to them their state affairs with greater 
<A NAME="192"></A>freedom than the women would communicate with the men in the private business 
<A NAME="193"></A>of their families. Which was indeed one of the greatest obstacles to this 
<A NAME="194"></A>design; for the money of Sparta being most of it in the women's hands, 
<A NAME="195"></A>it was their interest to oppose it, not only as depriving them of those 
<A NAME="196"></A>superfluous trifles, in which, through want of better knowledge and experience, 
<A NAME="197"></A>they placed their chief felicity, but also because they knew their riches 
<A NAME="198"></A>were the main support of their power and credit.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR>Those, therefore, who were of this faction had recourse to Leonidas 
<A NAME="200"></A>representing to him how it was his part, as the elder and more experienced, 
<A NAME="201"></A>to put a stop to the ill-advised projects of a rash young man. Leonidas, 
<A NAME="202"></A>though of himself sufficiently inclined to oppose Agis, durst not openly, 
<A NAME="203"></A>for fear of the people, who were manifestly desirous of this change; but 
<A NAME="204"></A>underhand he did all he could to discredit and thwart the project, and 
<A NAME="205"></A>to prejudice the chief magistrates against him, and on all occasions craftily 
<A NAME="206"></A>insinuated that it was at the price of letting him usurp arbitrary power 
<A NAME="207"></A>that Agis thus proposed to divide the property of the rich among the poor, 
<A NAME="208"></A>and that the object of these measures for cancelling debts and dividing 
<A NAME="209"></A>the lands, was not to furnish Sparta with citizens, but purchase him a 
<A NAME="210"></A>tyrant's body guard.
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR>Agis, nevertheless, little regarding these rumours, procured Lysander's 
<A NAME="212"></A>election as ephor; and then took the first occasion of proposing through 
<A NAME="213"></A>him his Rhetra to the council, the chief articles of which were these: 
<A NAME="214"></A>That every one should be free from their debts: all the lands to be divided 
<A NAME="215"></A>into equal portions, those that lay betwixt the watercourse near Pellene 
<A NAME="216"></A>and Mount Taygetus, and as far as the cities of Malea and Sellasia, into 
<A NAME="217"></A>four thousand five hundred lots, the remainder into fifteen thousand; these 
<A NAME="218"></A>last to be shared out among those of the country people who were fit for 
<A NAME="219"></A>service as heavy-armed soldiers, the first among the natural-born Spartans, 
<A NAME="220"></A>and their number also should be supplied from any among the country people 
<A NAME="221"></A>or strangers who had received the proper breeding of freemen, and were 
<A NAME="222"></A>of vigorous body and of age for military service. All these were to be 
<A NAME="223"></A>divided into fifteen companies, some of four hundred, and some of two, 
<A NAME="224"></A>with a diet and discipline agreeable to the laws of 
<A NAME="225"></A>Lycurgus.
<A NAME="226"></A><BR><BR>This decree being proposed in the council of Elders, met there 
<A NAME="227"></A>with opposition; so that Lysander immediately convoked the great assembly 
<A NAME="228"></A>of the people, to whom he, Mandroclidas, and Agesilaus made orations exhorting 
<A NAME="229"></A>them that they would not suffer the majesty of Sparta to remain abandoned 
<A NAME="230"></A>to contempt, to gratify a few rich men, who lorded it over them; but that 
<A NAME="231"></A>they should call to mind the oracles in old times which had forewarned 
<A NAME="232"></A>them to beware of the love of money, as the great danger and probable ruin 
<A NAME="233"></A>of Sparta, and, moreover, those recently brought from the temple of Pasiphae. 
<A NAME="234"></A>This was a famous temple and oracle at Thalamae; and this Pasiphae, some 
<A NAME="235"></A>say, was one of the daughters of Atlas, who had by Jupiter a son called 
<A NAME="236"></A>Ammon; others are of opinion it was Cassandra, the daughter of King Priam, 
<A NAME="237"></A>who dying in this place, was called Pasiphae, as the revealer of oracles 
<A NAME="238"></A>to all men. Phylarchus says, that this was Daphne, the daughter of Amyclas, 
<A NAME="239"></A>who, flying from Apollo, was transformed into a laurel, and honoured by 
<A NAME="240"></A>that god with the gift of prophecy. But be it as will, it is certain the 
<A NAME="241"></A>people were made to apprehend that this oracle had commanded them to return 
<A NAME="242"></A>to their former state of equality settled by Lycurgus. As soon as these 
<A NAME="243"></A>had done speaking, Agis stood up, and after a few words, told them he would 
<A NAME="244"></A>make the best contribution in his power to the new legislation, which was 
<A NAME="245"></A>proposed for their advantage. In the first place, he would divide among 
<A NAME="246"></A>them all his patrimony, which was of large extent in tillage and pasture; 
<A NAME="247"></A>he would also give six hundred talents in ready money, and his mother, 
<A NAME="248"></A>grandmother, and his other friends and relations, who were the richest 
<A NAME="249"></A>of the Lacedaemonians, were ready to follow his example.
<A NAME="250"></A><BR><BR>The people were transported with admiration of the young man's 
<A NAME="251"></A>generosity, and with joy that, after three hundred years' interval, at 
<A NAME="252"></A>last there had appeared a king worthy of Sparta. But, on the other side, 
<A NAME="253"></A>Leonidas was now more than ever averse, being sensible that he and his 
<A NAME="254"></A>friends would be obliged to contribute with their riches, and yet all the 
<A NAME="255"></A>honour and obligation would redound to Agis. He asked him then before them 
<A NAME="256"></A>all, whether Lycurgus were not in his opinion a wise man, and a lover of 
<A NAME="257"></A>his country. Agis answering he was, "And when did Lycurgus," replied Leonidas, 
<A NAME="258"></A>"cancel debts, or admit strangers to citizenship,- he who thought the commonwealth 
<A NAME="259"></A>not secure unless from time to time the city was cleared of all strangers?" 
<A NAME="260"></A>To this Agis replied, "It is no wonder that Leonidas, who was brought up 
<A NAME="261"></A>and married abroad, and has children by a wife taken out of a Persian court, 
<A NAME="262"></A>should know little of Lycurgus or his laws. Lycurgus took away both debts 
<A NAME="263"></A>and loans, by taking away money; and objected indeed to the presence of 
<A NAME="264"></A>men who were foreign to the manners and customs of the country, not in 
<A NAME="265"></A>any case from an ill-will to their persons, but lest the example of their 
<A NAME="266"></A>lives and conduct should infect the city with the love of riches, and of 
<A NAME="267"></A>delicate and luxurious habits. For it is well known that he himself gladly 
<A NAME="268"></A>kept Terpander, Thales, and Pherecydes though they were strangers, because 
<A NAME="269"></A>he perceived they were in their poems and in their philosophy of the same 
<A NAME="270"></A>mind with him. And you that are wont to praise Ecprepes, who, being ephor, 
<A NAME="271"></A>cut with his hatchet two of the nine strings from the instrument of Phrynis 
<A NAME="272"></A>the musician, and to commend those who afterwards imitated him, in cutting 
<A NAME="273"></A>the strings of Timotheus's harp, with what face can you blame us for designing 
<A NAME="274"></A>to cut off superfluity and luxury and display from the commonwealth? Do 
<A NAME="275"></A>you think those men were so concerned only about a lute-string, or intended 
<A NAME="276"></A>anything else than to check in music that same excess and extravagance 
<A NAME="277"></A>which rule in our present lives and manners, and have disturbed and destroyed 
<A NAME="278"></A>all the harmony and order of our city?"
<A NAME="279"></A><BR><BR>From this time forward, as the common people followed Agis, so 
<A NAME="280"></A>the rich men adhered to Leonidas. They besought him not to forsake their 
<A NAME="281"></A>cause; and with persuasions and entreaties so far prevailed with the council 
<A NAME="282"></A>of Elders, whose power consisted in preparing all laws before they were 
<A NAME="283"></A>proposed to the people, that the designed Rhetra was rejected, though but 
<A NAME="284"></A>by only one vote. Whereupon Lysander, who was still ephor, resolving to 
<A NAME="285"></A>be revenged on Leonidas, drew up an information against him, grounded on 
<A NAME="286"></A>two old laws: the one forbids any of the blood of Hercules to raise up 
<A NAME="287"></A>children by a foreign woman, and the other makes it capital for a Lacedaemonian 
<A NAME="288"></A>to leave his country to settle among foreigners. Whilst he set others on 
<A NAME="289"></A>to manage this accusation, he with his colleagues went to observe the sign, 
<A NAME="290"></A>which was a custom they had, and performed in this manner. Every ninth 
<A NAME="291"></A>year, the ephors, choosing a starlight night, when there is neither cloud 
<A NAME="292"></A>nor moon, sit down together in quiet and silence, and watch the sky. And 
<A NAME="293"></A>if they chance to see the shooting of a star, they presently pronounce 
<A NAME="294"></A>their king guilty of some offence against the gods, and thereupon he is 
<A NAME="295"></A>immediately suspended from all exercise of regal power, till he is relieved 
<A NAME="296"></A>by an oracle from Delphi or Olympia.
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR>Lysander, therefore, assured the people he had seen a star shoot, 
<A NAME="298"></A>and at the same time Leonidas was cited to answer for himself. Witnesses 
<A NAME="299"></A>were produced to testify he had married an Asian woman, bestowed on him 
<A NAME="300"></A>by one of King Seleucus's lieutenants: that he had two children by her, 
<A NAME="301"></A>but she so disliked and hated him, that against his wishes, flying from 
<A NAME="302"></A>her, he was in a manner forced to return to Sparta, where his predecessor 
<A NAME="303"></A>dying without issue, he took upon him the government. Lysander, not content 
<A NAME="304"></A>with this, persuaded also Cleombrotus to lay claim to the kingdom. He was 
<A NAME="305"></A>of the royal family, and son-in-law to Leonidas; who, fearing now the event 
<A NAME="306"></A>of this process, fled as a suppliant to the temple of Minerva of the Brazen 
<A NAME="307"></A>House, together with his daughter, the wife of Cleombrotus; for she in 
<A NAME="308"></A>this occasion resolved to leave her husband, and to follow her father. 
<A NAME="309"></A>Leonidas being again cited, and not appearing, they pronounced a sentence 
<A NAME="310"></A>of deposition against him, and made Cleombrotus king in his 
<A NAME="311"></A>place.
<A NAME="312"></A><BR><BR>Soon after this revolution, Lysander, his year expiring, went out 
<A NAME="313"></A>of his office, and new ephors were chosen, who gave Leonidas assurance 
<A NAME="314"></A>of safety, and cited Lysander and Mandroclidas to answer for having, contrary 
<A NAME="315"></A>to law, cancelled debts, and designed a new division of lands. They, seeing 
<A NAME="316"></A>themselves in danger, had recourse to the two kings, and represented to 
<A NAME="317"></A>them how necessary it was for their interest and safety to act with united 
<A NAME="318"></A>authority, and bid defiance to the ephors. For, indeed, the power of the 
<A NAME="319"></A>ephors, they said, was only grounded on the dissensions of the kings, it 
<A NAME="320"></A>being their privilege, when the kings differed in opinion, to add their 
<A NAME="321"></A>suffrage to whichever they judged to have given the best advice; but when 
<A NAME="322"></A>the two kings were unanimous, none ought or durst resist their authority, 
<A NAME="323"></A>the magistrate, whose office it was to stand as umpire when they were at 
<A NAME="324"></A>variance, had no call to interfere when they were of one mind. Agis and 
<A NAME="325"></A>Cleombrotus, thus persuaded, went together with their friends into the 
<A NAME="326"></A>market-place, where removing the ephors from their seats, they placed others 
<A NAME="327"></A>in their room, of whom Agesilaus was one; proceeding then to arm a company 
<A NAME="328"></A>of young men, and releasing many out of prison; so that those of the contrary 
<A NAME="329"></A>faction began to be in great fear of their lives; but there was no blood 
<A NAME="330"></A>spilt. On the contrary, Agis, having notice that Agesilaus had ordered 
<A NAME="331"></A>a company of soldiers to lie in wait for Leonidas, to kill him as he fled 
<A NAME="332"></A>to Tegea, immediately sent some of his followers to defend him, and to 
<A NAME="333"></A>convey him safely into that city.
<A NAME="334"></A><BR><BR>Thus far all things proceeded prosperously, none daring to oppose; 
<A NAME="335"></A>but through the sordid weakness of one man, these promising beginnings 
<A NAME="336"></A>were blasted, and a most noble and truly Spartan purpose overthrown and 
<A NAME="337"></A>ruined by the love of money. Agesilaus, as we said, was much in debt, though 
<A NAME="338"></A>in possession of one of the largest and best estates in land; and while 
<A NAME="339"></A>he gladly joined in this design to be quit of his debts, he was not at 
<A NAME="340"></A>all willing to part with his land. Therefore he persuaded Agis, that if 
<A NAME="341"></A>both these things should be put in execution at the same time, so great 
<A NAME="342"></A>and so sudden an alteration might cause some dangerous commotion; but if 
<A NAME="343"></A>debts were in the first place cancelled, the rich men would afterwards 
<A NAME="344"></A>more easily be prevailed with to part with their land. Lysander, also, 
<A NAME="345"></A>was of the same opinion, being deceived in like manner by the craft of 
<A NAME="346"></A>Agesilaus; so that all men were presently commanded to bring in their bonds, 
<A NAME="347"></A>or deeds of obligation, by the Lacedaemonians called Claria, into the market-place, 
<A NAME="348"></A>where being laid together in a heap they set fire to them. The wealthy, 
<A NAME="349"></A>money-lending people, one may easily imagine, beheld it with a heavy heart; 
<A NAME="350"></A>but Agesilaus told them scoffingly, his eyes had never seen so bright and 
<A NAME="351"></A>so pure a flame.
<A NAME="352"></A><BR><BR>And now the people pressed earnestly for an immediate division 
<A NAME="353"></A>of lands; the kings also had ordered it should be done; but Agesilaus, 
<A NAME="354"></A>sometimes pretending one difficulty, and sometimes another, delayed the 
<A NAME="355"></A>execution, till an occasion happened to call Agis to the wars. The Achaeans, 
<A NAME="356"></A>in virtue of a defensive treaty of alliance, sent to demand succours, as 
<A NAME="357"></A>they expected every day that Aetolians would attempt to enter Peloponnesus, 
<A NAME="358"></A>from the territory of Megara. They had sent Aratus, their general, to collect 
<A NAME="359"></A>forces to hinder this incursion. Aratus wrote to the ephors, who immediately 
<A NAME="360"></A>gave order that Agis should hasten to their assistance with the Lacedaemonian 
<A NAME="361"></A>auxiliaries. Agis was extremely pleased to see the zeal and bravery of 
<A NAME="362"></A>those who went with him upon this expedition. They were, for the most part 
<A NAME="363"></A>young men, and poor; and being just released from their debts and set at 
<A NAME="364"></A>liberty, and hoping on their return to receive each man his lot of land, 
<A NAME="365"></A>they followed their king with wonderful alacrity. The cities through which 
<A NAME="366"></A>they passed were in admiration to see how they marched from one end of 
<A NAME="367"></A>Peloponnesus to the other, without the least disorder, and, in a manner, 
<A NAME="368"></A>without being heard. It gave the Greeks occasion to discourse with one 
<A NAME="369"></A>another, how great might be the temperance and modesty of a Laconian army 
<A NAME="370"></A>in old time, under their famous captains: Agesilaus, Lysander, or Leonidas, 
<A NAME="371"></A>since they saw such discipline and exact obedience under a leader who perhaps 
<A NAME="372"></A>was the youngest man in all the army. They saw also how he was himself 
<A NAME="373"></A>content to fare hardly, ready to undergo any labours, and not to be distinguished 
<A NAME="374"></A>by pomp or richness of habit or arms from the meanest of his soldiers; 
<A NAME="375"></A>and to people in general it was an object of regard and admiration. But 
<A NAME="376"></A>rich men viewed the innovation with dislike and alarm, lest haply the example 
<A NAME="377"></A>might spread, and work changes to their prejudice in their own countries 
<A NAME="378"></A>as well.
<A NAME="379"></A><BR><BR>Agis joined Aratus near the city of Corinth, where it was still 
<A NAME="380"></A>a matter of debate whether or no it were expedient to give the enemy battle. 
<A NAME="381"></A>Agis, on this occasion, showed great forwardness and resolution, yet without 
<A NAME="382"></A>temerity or presumption. He declared it was his opinion they ought to fight, 
<A NAME="383"></A>thereby to hinder the enemy from passing the gates of Peloponnesus, but 
<A NAME="384"></A>nevertheless he would submit to the judgment of Aratus, not only as the 
<A NAME="385"></A>elder and more experienced captain, but as he was general of the Achaeans, 
<A NAME="386"></A>whose forces he would not pretend to command, but was only come thither 
<A NAME="387"></A>to assist them. I am not ignorant that Baton of Sinope relates it in another 
<A NAME="388"></A>manner; he says, Aratus would have fought, and that Agis was against it; 
<A NAME="389"></A>but it is certain he was mistaken, not having read what Aratus himself 
<A NAME="390"></A>wrote in his own justification, that knowing the people had well-nigh got 
<A NAME="391"></A>in their harvest, he thought it much better to let the enemy pass than 
<A NAME="392"></A>put all to the hazard of a battle. And, therefore, giving thanks to the 
<A NAME="393"></A>confederates for their readiness, he dismissed them. And Agis, not without 
<A NAME="394"></A>having gained a great deal of honour, returned to Sparta, where he found 
<A NAME="395"></A>the people in disorder, and a new revolution imminent, owing to the ill-government 
<A NAME="396"></A>of Agesilaus.
<A NAME="397"></A><BR><BR>For he, being now one of the ephors, and freed from the fear which 
<A NAME="398"></A>formerly kept him in some restraint, forbore no kind of oppression which 
<A NAME="399"></A>might bring in gain. Among other things, he exacted a thirteenth month's 
<A NAME="400"></A>tax, whereas the usual cycle required at this time no such addition to 
<A NAME="401"></A>the year. For these and other reasons fearing those whom he injured, and 
<A NAME="402"></A>knowing how he was hated by the people, he thought it necessary to maintain 
<A NAME="403"></A>a guard, which always accompanied him to the magistrate's office. And presuming 
<A NAME="404"></A>now on his power, he was grown so insolent, that of the two kings, the 
<A NAME="405"></A>one he openly contemned, and if he showed any respect towards Agis, would 
<A NAME="406"></A>have it thought rather an effect of his near relationship, than any duty 
<A NAME="407"></A>or submission to the royal authority. He gave it out also that he was to 
<A NAME="408"></A>continue ephor the ensuing year.
<A NAME="409"></A><BR><BR>His enemies, therefore, alarmed by this report, lost no time in 
<A NAME="410"></A>risking an attempt against him; and openly bringing back Leonidas from 
<A NAME="411"></A>Tegea, re-established him in the kingdom, to which even the people, highly 
<A NAME="412"></A>incensed for having been defrauded in the promised division of lands, willingly 
<A NAME="413"></A>consented. Agesilaus himself would hardly have escaped their fury, if his 
<A NAME="414"></A>son, Hippomedon, whose manly virtues made him dear to all, had not saved 
<A NAME="415"></A>him out of their hands, and then privately conveyed him from the 
<A NAME="416"></A>city.
<A NAME="417"></A><BR><BR>During the commotion, the two kings fled, Agis to the temple of 
<A NAME="418"></A>the Brazen House, and Cleombrotus to that of Neptune. For Leonidas was 
<A NAME="419"></A>more incensed against his son-in-law; and leaving Agis alone, went with 
<A NAME="420"></A>his soldiers to Cleombrotus's sanctuary, and there with great passion reproached 
<A NAME="421"></A>him for having, though he was son-in-law, conspired with his enemies, usurped 
<A NAME="422"></A>his throne, and forced him from his country. Cleombrotus, having little 
<A NAME="423"></A>to say for himself, sat silent. His wife, Chilonis, the daughter of Leonidas, 
<A NAME="424"></A>had chosen to follow her father in his sufferings; for when Cleombrotus 
<A NAME="425"></A>usurped the kingdom, she forsook him, and wholly devoted herself to comfort 
<A NAME="426"></A>her father in his affliction; whilst he still remained in Sparta, she remained 
<A NAME="427"></A>also, as a suppliant, with him, and when he fled, she fled with him, bewailing 
<A NAME="428"></A>his misfortune, and extremely displeased with Cleombrotus. But now, upon 
<A NAME="429"></A>this turn of fortune, she changed in like manner, and was seen sitting 
<A NAME="430"></A>now, as a suppliant, with her husband, embracing him with her arms, and 
<A NAME="431"></A>having her two little children beside her. All men were full of wonder 
<A NAME="432"></A>at the piety and tender affection of the young woman, who pointing to her 
<A NAME="433"></A>robes and her hair, both alike neglected and unattended to, said to Leonidas, 
<A NAME="434"></A>"I am not brought, my father, to this condition you see me in, on account 
<A NAME="435"></A>of the present misfortunes of Cleombrotus; my mourning habit is long since 
<A NAME="436"></A>familiar to me. It was put on to condole with you in your banishment; and 
<A NAME="437"></A>now you are restored to your country, and to your kingdom, must I still 
<A NAME="438"></A>remain in grief and misery? Or would you have me attired in my royal ornaments, 
<A NAME="439"></A>that I may rejoice with you, when you have killed, within my arms, the 
<A NAME="440"></A>man to whom you gave me for a wife? Either Cleombrotus must appease you 
<A NAME="441"></A>by mine and my children's tears, or he must suffer a punishment greater 
<A NAME="442"></A>than you propose for his faults, and shall see me, whom he loves so well, 
<A NAME="443"></A>die before him. To what end should I live, or how shall I appear among 
<A NAME="444"></A>the Spartan women, when it shall so manifestly be seen, that I have not 
<A NAME="445"></A>been able to move to compassion either a husband or a father? I was born, 
<A NAME="446"></A>it seems, to participate in the ill-fortune and in the disgrace, both as 
<A NAME="447"></A>a wife and a daughter, of those nearest and dearest to me. As for Cleombrotus 
<A NAME="448"></A>I sufficiently surrendered any honourable plea on his behalf, when I forsook 
<A NAME="449"></A>him to follow you; but you yourself offer the fairest excuse for his proceedings, 
<A NAME="450"></A>by showing to the world that for the sake of a kingdom it is just to kill 
<A NAME="451"></A>a son-in-law, and be regardless of a daughter." Chilonis, having ended 
<A NAME="452"></A>this lamentation, rested her face on her husband's head, and looked round 
<A NAME="453"></A>with her weeping and woe-begone eyes upon those who stood before 
<A NAME="454"></A>her.
<A NAME="455"></A><BR><BR>Leonidas, touched with compassion, withdrew a while to advise with 
<A NAME="456"></A>his friends; then returning, bade Cleombrotus leave the sanctuary and go 
<A NAME="457"></A>into banishment; Chilonis, he said, ought to stay with him it not being 
<A NAME="458"></A>just she should forsake a father whose affection had granted to her intercession 
<A NAME="459"></A>the life of her husband. But all he could say would not prevail. She rose 
<A NAME="460"></A>up immediately, and taking one of her children in her arms, gave the other 
<A NAME="461"></A>to her husband; and making her reverence to the altar of the goddess, went 
<A NAME="462"></A>out and followed him. So that, in a word, if Cleombrotus were not utterly 
<A NAME="463"></A>blinded by ambition, he must surely choose to be banished with so excellent 
<A NAME="464"></A>a woman rather than without her to possess a kingdom.
<A NAME="465"></A><BR><BR>Cleombrotus thus removed, Leonidas proceeded also to displace the 
<A NAME="466"></A>ephors, and to choose others in their room; then he began to consider how 
<A NAME="467"></A>he might entrap Agis. At first, he endeavoured by fair means to persuade 
<A NAME="468"></A>him to leave the sanctuary, and partake with him in the kingdom. The people, 
<A NAME="469"></A>he said, would easily pardon the errors of a young man, ambitious of glory, 
<A NAME="470"></A>and deceived by the craft of Agesilaus. But finding Agis was suspicious, 
<A NAME="471"></A>and not to be prevailed with to quit his sanctuary, he gave up that design; 
<A NAME="472"></A>yet what could not then be effected by the dissimulation of an enemy, was 
<A NAME="473"></A>soon after brought to pass by the treachery of friends.
<A NAME="474"></A><BR><BR>Amphares, Damochares, and Arcesilaus often visited Agis, and he 
<A NAME="475"></A>was so confident of their fidelity that after a while he was prevailed 
<A NAME="476"></A>on to accompany them to the baths, which were not far distant, they constantly 
<A NAME="477"></A>returning to see him safe again in the temple. They were all three his 
<A NAME="478"></A>familiars; and Amphares had borrowed a great deal of plate and rich household 
<A NAME="479"></A>stuff from Agesistrata, and hoped if he could destroy her and the whole 
<A NAME="480"></A>family, he might peaceably enjoy those goods. And he, it is said, was the 
<A NAME="481"></A>readiest of all to serve the purposes of Leonidas, and being one of the 
<A NAME="482"></A>ephors, did all he could to incense the rest of his colleagues against 
<A NAME="483"></A>Agis. These men, therefore, finding that Agis would not quit his sanctuary, 
<A NAME="484"></A>but on occasion would venture from it to go to the bath, resolved to seize 
<A NAME="485"></A>him on the opportunity thus given them. And one day as he was returning, 
<A NAME="486"></A>they met and saluted him as formerly, conversing pleasantly by the way, 
<A NAME="487"></A>and jesting, as youthful friends might, till coming to the turning of a 
<A NAME="488"></A>street which led to the prison, Amphares, by virtue of his office, laid 
<A NAME="489"></A>his hand on Agis, and told him, "You must go with me, Agis, before the 
<A NAME="490"></A>other ephors, to answer for your misdemeanours." At the same time Damochares, 
<A NAME="491"></A>who was a tall, strong man, drew his cloak tight round his neck, and dragged 
<A NAME="492"></A>him after by it, whilst the others went behind to thrust him on. So that 
<A NAME="493"></A>none of Agis's friend being near to assist him, nor any one by, they easily 
<A NAME="494"></A>got him into the prison, where Leonidas was already arrived, with a company 
<A NAME="495"></A>of soldiers, who strongly guarded all the avenues; the ephors also came 
<A NAME="496"></A>in, with as many of the Elders as they knew to be true to their party, 
<A NAME="497"></A>being desirous to proceed with some semblance of justice. And thus they 
<A NAME="498"></A>bade him give an account of his actions. To which Agis, smiling at their 
<A NAME="499"></A>dissimulation, answered not a word. Amphares told him it was more seasonable 
<A NAME="500"></A>to weep, for now the time was come in which he should be punished for his 
<A NAME="501"></A>presumption. Another of the ephors, as though he would be more favourable, 
<A NAME="502"></A>and offering as it were an excuse, asked him whether he was not forced 
<A NAME="503"></A>to what he did by Agesilaus and Lysander. But Agis answered, he had not 
<A NAME="504"></A>been constrained by any man, nor had any other intent in what he did but 
<A NAME="505"></A>only to follow the example of Lycurgus, and to govern conformably to his 
<A NAME="506"></A>laws. The same ephor asked him whether now at least he did not repent his 
<A NAME="507"></A>rashness. To which the young man answered that though he were to suffer 
<A NAME="508"></A>the extremest penalty for it, yet he could never repent of so just and 
<A NAME="509"></A>so glorious a design. Upon this they passed sentence of death on him, and 
<A NAME="510"></A>bade the officers carry him to the Dechas, as it is called, a place in 
<A NAME="511"></A>the prison where they strangle malefactors. And when the officers would 
<A NAME="512"></A>not venture to lay hands on him, and the very mercenary soldiers declined 
<A NAME="513"></A>it, believing it an illegal and a wicked act to lay violent hands on a 
<A NAME="514"></A>king, Demochares, threatening and reviling them for it, himself thrust 
<A NAME="515"></A>him into the room.
<A NAME="516"></A><BR><BR>For by this time the news of his being seized had reached many 
<A NAME="517"></A>parts of the city, and there was a concourse of people with lights and 
<A NAME="518"></A>torches about the prison gates, and in the midst of them the mother and 
<A NAME="519"></A>the grandmother of Agis, crying out with a loud voice that their king ought 
<A NAME="520"></A>to appear, and to be heard and judged by the people. But this clamour, 
<A NAME="521"></A>instead of preventing, hastened his death; his enemies fearing, if the 
<A NAME="522"></A>tumult should increase, he might be rescued during the night out of their 
<A NAME="523"></A>hands.
<A NAME="524"></A><BR><BR>Agis, being now at the point to die, perceived one of the officers 
<A NAME="525"></A>bitterly bewailing his misfortune; "Weep not, friend," said he, "for me, 
<A NAME="526"></A>who die innocent, by the lawless act of wicked men. My condition is much 
<A NAME="527"></A>better than theirs." As soon as he had spoken these words, not showing 
<A NAME="528"></A>the least sign of fear, he offered his neck to the noose.
<A NAME="529"></A><BR><BR>Immediately after he was dead, Amphares went out of the prison 
<A NAME="530"></A>gate, where he found Agesistrata, who, believing him still the same friend 
<A NAME="531"></A>as before, threw herself at his feet. He gently raised her up, and assured 
<A NAME="532"></A>her, she need not fear any further violence or danger of death for her 
<A NAME="533"></A>son, and that if pleased she might go in and see him. She begged her mother 
<A NAME="534"></A>might also have the favour to be admitted, and he replied, nobody should 
<A NAME="535"></A>hinder it. When they were entered, he commanded the gate should again be 
<A NAME="536"></A>locked, and Archidamia, the grandmother, to be first introduced. She was 
<A NAME="537"></A>now grown very old, and had lived all her days in the highest repute among 
<A NAME="538"></A>her fellows. As soon as Amphares thought she was despatched, he told Agesistrata 
<A NAME="539"></A>she might now go in if she pleased. She entered, and beholding her son's 
<A NAME="540"></A>body stretched on the ground, and her mother hanging by the neck, the first 
<A NAME="541"></A>thing she did was, with her own hands, to assist the officers in taking 
<A NAME="542"></A>down the body; then covering it decently, she laid it out by her son's, 
<A NAME="543"></A>whom then embracing and kissing his cheeks, "O my son," said she, "it was 
<A NAME="544"></A>thy too great mercy and goodness which brought thee and us to ruin." Amphares, 
<A NAME="545"></A>who stood watching behind the door, on hearing this, broke in, and said 
<A NAME="546"></A>angrily to her, "Since you approve so well of your son's actions, it is 
<A NAME="547"></A>fit you should partake in his reward." She, rising up to offer herself 
<A NAME="548"></A>to the noose, said only, "I pray that it may redound to the good of 
<A NAME="549"></A>Sparta."
<A NAME="550"></A><BR><BR>The three bodies being now exposed to view, and the fact divulged, 
<A NAME="551"></A>no fear was strong enough to hinder the people from expressing their abhorrence 
<A NAME="552"></A>of what was done, and their detestation of Leonidas and Amphares, the contrivers 
<A NAME="553"></A>of it. So wicked and barbarous an act had never been committed in Sparta 
<A NAME="554"></A>since first the Dorians inhabited Peloponnesus; the very enemies in war, 
<A NAME="555"></A>they said, were always cautious in spilling the blood of a Lacedaemonian 
<A NAME="556"></A>king, insomuch that in any combat they would decline, and endeavour to 
<A NAME="557"></A>avoid them, from feelings of respect and reverence for their station. And 
<A NAME="558"></A>certainly we see that in the many battles fought betwixt the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="559"></A>and the other Greeks, up to the time of Philip of Macedon, not one of their 
<A NAME="560"></A>kings was ever killed, except Cleombrotus by a javelin-wound at the battle 
<A NAME="561"></A>of Leuctra. I am not ignorant that the Messenians affirm, Theopompus was 
<A NAME="562"></A>also slain by their Aristomenes; but the Lacedaemonians deny it, and say 
<A NAME="563"></A>he was only wounded.
<A NAME="564"></A><BR><BR>Be it as it will, it is certain at least that Agis was the first 
<A NAME="565"></A>king put to death in Lacedaemon by the ephors, for having undertaken a 
<A NAME="566"></A>design noble in itself and worthy of his country, at a time of life when 
<A NAME="567"></A>men's errors usually meet with an easy pardon. And if errors he did commit, 
<A NAME="568"></A>his enemies certainly had less reason to blame him than had his friends 
<A NAME="569"></A>for that gentle and compassionate temper which made him save the life of 
<A NAME="570"></A>Leonidas and believe in other men's professions.
