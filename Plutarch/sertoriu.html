<BR>(legendary, died 72 B.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>IT is no great wonder if in long process of time, while fortune takes her 
<A NAME="11"></A>course hither and thither, numerous coincidences should spontaneously occur. 
<A NAME="12"></A>If the number and variety of subjects to be wrought upon be infinite, it 
<A NAME="13"></A>is all the more easy for fortune, with such an abundance of material, to 
<A NAME="14"></A>effect this similarity of results. Or if, on the other hand, events are 
<A NAME="15"></A>limited to the combinations of some finite number, then of necessity the 
<A NAME="16"></A>same must often recur, and in the same sequence. There are people who take 
<A NAME="17"></A>a pleasure in making collections of all such fortuitous occurrences that 
<A NAME="18"></A>they have heard or read of, as look like works of a rational power and 
<A NAME="19"></A>design; they observe, for example, that two eminent persons whose names 
<A NAME="20"></A>were Attis, the one a Syrian, the other of Arcadia, were both slain by 
<A NAME="21"></A>a wild boar; that of two whose names were Actaeon, the one was torn in 
<A NAME="22"></A>pieces by his dogs, the other by his lovers; that of two famous Scipios, 
<A NAME="23"></A>the one overthrew the Carthaginians in war, the other totally ruined and 
<A NAME="24"></A>destroyed them; the city of Troy was the first time taken by Hercules for 
<A NAME="25"></A>the horses promised him by Laomedon, the second time by Agamemnon, by means 
<A NAME="26"></A>of the celebrated great wooden horse, and the third time by Charidemus, 
<A NAME="27"></A>by occasion of a horse falling down at the gate, which hindered the Trojans, 
<A NAME="28"></A>so that they could not shut them soon enough; and of two cities which take 
<A NAME="29"></A>their names from the most agreeable odoriferous plants, Ios and Smyrna, 
<A NAME="30"></A>the one from a violet, the other from myrrh, the poet Homer is reported 
<A NAME="31"></A>to have been born in the one and to have died in the other. And so to these 
<A NAME="32"></A>instances let us further add, that the most warlike commanders, and most 
<A NAME="33"></A>remarkable for exploits of skilful stratagem, have had but one eye; as 
<A NAME="34"></A>Philip, Antigonus, Hannibal, and Sertorius, whose life and actions we describe 
<A NAME="35"></A>at present; of whom, indeed, we might truly say, that he was more continent 
<A NAME="36"></A>than Philip, more faithful to his friends than Antigonus, and more merciful 
<A NAME="37"></A>to his enemies than Hannibal; and that for prudence and judgment he gave 
<A NAME="38"></A>place to none of them, but in fortune was inferior to them all. Yet though 
<A NAME="39"></A>he had continually in her a far more difficult adversary to contend against 
<A NAME="40"></A>than his open enemies, he nevertheless maintained his ground, with the 
<A NAME="41"></A>military skill of Metellus, the boldness of Pompey, the success of Sylla, 
<A NAME="42"></A>and the power of the Roman people, all to be encountered by one who was 
<A NAME="43"></A>a banished man and a stranger at the head of a body of barbarians. Among 
<A NAME="44"></A>Greek commanders, Eumenes of Cardia may be best compared with him; they 
<A NAME="45"></A>were both of them men born for command, for warfare, and for stratagem; 
<A NAME="46"></A>both banished from their countries, and holding command over strangers; 
<A NAME="47"></A>both had fortune for their adversary, in their last days so harshly so, 
<A NAME="48"></A>that they were both betrayed and murdered by those who served them, and 
<A NAME="49"></A>with whom they had formerly overcome their enemies.
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR>Quintus Sertorius was of a noble family, born in the city of Nursia, 
<A NAME="51"></A>in the country of the Sabines; his father died when he was young, and he 
<A NAME="52"></A>was carefully and decently educated by his mother, whose name was Rhea, 
<A NAME="53"></A>and whom he appears to have extremely loved and honoured. He paid some 
<A NAME="54"></A>attention to the study of oratory and pleading in his youth, and acquired 
<A NAME="55"></A>some reputation and influence in Rome by his eloquence; but the splendour 
<A NAME="56"></A>of his actions in arms, and his successful achievements in the wars, drew 
<A NAME="57"></A>off his ambition in that direction.
<A NAME="58"></A><BR><BR>At his first beginning, he served under Caepio, when the Cimbri 
<A NAME="59"></A>and Teutones invaded Gaul; where the Romans fighting unsuccessfully, and 
<A NAME="60"></A>being put to flight, he was wounded in many parts of his body, and lost 
<A NAME="61"></A>his horse, yet, nevertheless, swam across the river Rhone in his armour, 
<A NAME="62"></A>with his breastplate and shield, bearing himself up against the violence 
<A NAME="63"></A>of the current; so strong and so well inured to hardship was his 
<A NAME="64"></A>body.
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR>The second time that the Cimbri and Teutones came down with some 
<A NAME="66"></A>hundreds of thousands, threatening death and destruction to all, when it 
<A NAME="67"></A>was no small piece of service for a Roman soldier to keep his ranks and 
<A NAME="68"></A>obey his commander, Sertorius undertook, while Marius led the army, to 
<A NAME="69"></A>spy out the enemy's camp. Procuring a Celtic dress, and acquainting himself 
<A NAME="70"></A>with the ordinary expressions of their language requisite for common intercourse, 
<A NAME="71"></A>he threw himself in amongst the barbarians; where having carefully seen 
<A NAME="72"></A>with his own eyes, or having been fully informed by persons upon the place 
<A NAME="73"></A>of all their most important concerns, he returned to Marius, from whose 
<A NAME="74"></A>hands he received the rewards of valour; and afterwards giving frequent 
<A NAME="75"></A>proof both of conduct and courage in all the following war, he was advanced 
<A NAME="76"></A>to places of honour and trust under his general. After the wars with the 
<A NAME="77"></A>Cimbri and Teutones, he was sent into Spain, having the command of a thousand 
<A NAME="78"></A>men under Didius, the Roman general, and wintered in the country of the 
<A NAME="79"></A>Celtiberians, in the city of Castulo, where the soldiers enjoying great 
<A NAME="80"></A>plenty, and growing insolent and continually drinking, the inhabitants 
<A NAME="81"></A>despised them and sent for aid by night to the Gyrisoenians, their near 
<A NAME="82"></A>neighbours, who fell upon the Romans in their lodgings and slew a great 
<A NAME="83"></A>number of them. Sertorius, with a few of his soldiers, made his way out, 
<A NAME="84"></A>and rallying together the rest who escaped, he marched round about the 
<A NAME="85"></A>walls, and finding the gate open, by which the Gyrisoenians had made their 
<A NAME="86"></A>secret entrance, he gave not them the same opportunity, but placing a guard 
<A NAME="87"></A>at the gate, and seizing upon all quarters of the city, he slew all who 
<A NAME="88"></A>were of age to bear arms, and then ordering his soldiers to lay aside their 
<A NAME="89"></A>weapons and put off their own clothes, and put on the accoutrements of 
<A NAME="90"></A>the barbarians, he commanded them to follow him to the city from whence 
<A NAME="91"></A>the men came who had made this night attack upon the Romans. And thus deceiving 
<A NAME="92"></A>the Gyrisoenians with the sight of their own armour, he found the gates 
<A NAME="93"></A>of their city open, and took a great number prisoners, who came out thinking 
<A NAME="94"></A>to meet their friends and fellow-citizens come home from a successful expedition. 
<A NAME="95"></A>Most of them were thus slain by the Romans at their own gates, and the 
<A NAME="96"></A>rest within yielded up themselves and were sold for 
<A NAME="97"></A>slaves.
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR>This action made Sertorius highly renowned throughout all Spain, 
<A NAME="99"></A>and as soon as be returned to Rome he was appointed quaestor of Cisalpine 
<A NAME="100"></A>Gaul, at a very seasonable moment for his country, the Marsian war being 
<A NAME="101"></A>on the point of breaking out. Sertorius was ordered to raise soldiers and 
<A NAME="102"></A>provide arms, which he performed with a diligence and alacrity, so contrasting 
<A NAME="103"></A>with the feebleness and slothfulness of other officers of his age, that 
<A NAME="104"></A>he got the repute of a man whose life would be one of action. Nor did he 
<A NAME="105"></A>relinquish the part of a soldier, now that he had arrived at the dignity 
<A NAME="106"></A>of a commander, but performed wonders with his own hands, and never sparing 
<A NAME="107"></A>himself, but exposing his body freely in all conflicts, he lost one of 
<A NAME="108"></A>his eyes. This he always esteemed an honour to him; observing that others 
<A NAME="109"></A>do not continually carry about with them the marks and testimonies of their 
<A NAME="110"></A>valour, but must often lay aside their chains of gold, their spears and 
<A NAME="111"></A>crowns; whereas his ensigns of honour, and the manifestations of his courage, 
<A NAME="112"></A>always remained with him, and those who beheld his misfortune must at the 
<A NAME="113"></A>same time recognize his merits. The people also paid him the respect he 
<A NAME="114"></A>deserved, and when he came into the theatre, received him with plaudits 
<A NAME="115"></A>and joyful acclamations, an honour rarely bestowed even on persons of advanced 
<A NAME="116"></A>standing and established reputation. Yet, notwithstanding this popularity, 
<A NAME="117"></A>when he stood to be tribune of the people, he was disappointed, and lost 
<A NAME="118"></A>the place, being opposed by the party of Sylla, which seems to have been 
<A NAME="119"></A>the principal cause of his subsequent enmity to Sylla.
<A NAME="120"></A><BR><BR>After that Marius was overcome by Sylla and fled into Africa, and 
<A NAME="121"></A>Sylla had left Italy to go to the wars against Mithridates, and of the 
<A NAME="122"></A>two consuls Octavius and Cinna, Octavius remained steadfast to the policy 
<A NAME="123"></A>of Sylla, but Cinna, desirous of a new revolution, attempted to recall 
<A NAME="124"></A>the lost interest of Marius, Sertorius joined Cinna's party, more particularly 
<A NAME="125"></A>as he saw that Octavius was not very capable, and was also suspicious of 
<A NAME="126"></A>any one that was a friend to Marius. When a great battle was fought between 
<A NAME="127"></A>the two consuls in the forum, Octavius overcame, and Cinna and Sertorius, 
<A NAME="128"></A>having lost not less than ten thousand men, left the city, and gaining 
<A NAME="129"></A>over most part of the troops who were dispersed about and remained still 
<A NAME="130"></A>in many parts of Italy, they in a short time mustered up a force against 
<A NAME="131"></A>Octavius sufficient to give him battle again, and Marius, also, now coming 
<A NAME="132"></A>by sea out of Africa, proffered himself to serve under Cinna, as a private 
<A NAME="133"></A>soldier under his consul and commander.
<A NAME="134"></A><BR><BR>Most were for the immediate reception of Marius, but Sertorius 
<A NAME="135"></A>openly declared against it, whether he thought that Cinna would not now 
<A NAME="136"></A>pay as much attention to himself, when a man of higher military repute 
<A NAME="137"></A>was present, or feared that the violence of Marius would bring all things 
<A NAME="138"></A>to confusion, by his boundless wrath and vengeance after victory. He insisted 
<A NAME="139"></A>upon it with Cinna that they were already victorious, that there remained 
<A NAME="140"></A>little to be done, and that if they admitted Marius, he would deprive them 
<A NAME="141"></A>of the glory and advantage of the war, as there was no man less easy to 
<A NAME="142"></A>deal with, or less to be trusted in, as a partner in power. Cinna answered, 
<A NAME="143"></A>that Sertorius rightly judged the affair, but that he himself was at a 
<A NAME="144"></A>loss, and ashamed, and knew not how to reject him, after he had sent for 
<A NAME="145"></A>him to share in his fortunes. To which Sertorius immediately replied, that 
<A NAME="146"></A>he had thought that Marius came into Italy of his own accord, and therefore 
<A NAME="147"></A>had deliberated as to what might be most expedient, but that Cinna ought 
<A NAME="148"></A>not so much as to have questioned whether he should accept him whom he 
<A NAME="149"></A>had already invited, but should have honourably received and employed him, 
<A NAME="150"></A>for his word once passed left no room for debate. Thus Marius being sent 
<A NAME="151"></A>for by Cinna, and their forces being divided into three parts, under Cinna, 
<A NAME="152"></A>Marius, and Sertorius, the war was brought to a successful conclusion; 
<A NAME="153"></A>but those about Cinna and Marius committing all manner of insolence and 
<A NAME="154"></A>cruelty, made the Romans think the evils of war a golden time in comparison. 
<A NAME="155"></A>On the contrary, it is reported of Sertorius that he never slew any man 
<A NAME="156"></A>in his anger to satisfy his own private revenge, nor ever insulted over 
<A NAME="157"></A>any one whom he had overcome, but was much offended with Marius, and often 
<A NAME="158"></A>privately entreated Cinna to use his power more moderately. And in the 
<A NAME="159"></A>end, when the slaves whom Marius had freed at his landing to increase his 
<A NAME="160"></A>army, being made not only his fellow-soldiers in the war, but also now 
<A NAME="161"></A>his guard in his usurpation, enriched and powerful by his favour, either 
<A NAME="162"></A>by the command or permission of Marius, or by their own lawless violence, 
<A NAME="163"></A>committed all sorts of crimes, killed their masters, ravished their masters' 
<A NAME="164"></A>wives and abused their children, their conduct appeared so intolerable 
<A NAME="165"></A>to Sertorius that he slew the whole body of them, four thousand in number, 
<A NAME="166"></A>commanding his soldiers to shoot them down with their javelins, as they 
<A NAME="167"></A>lay encamped together.
<A NAME="168"></A><BR><BR>Afterwards when Marius died, and Cinna shortly after was slain, 
<A NAME="169"></A>when the younger Marius made himself consul against Sertorius's wishes 
<A NAME="170"></A>and contrary to law, when Carbo, Norbanus, and Scipio fought unsuccessfully 
<A NAME="171"></A>against Sylla, now advancing to Rome, when much was lost by the cowardice 
<A NAME="172"></A>and remissness of the commanders, but more by the treachery of their party, 
<A NAME="173"></A>when with the want of prudence in the chief leaders, all went so ill that 
<A NAME="174"></A>his presence could do no good, in the end when Sylla had placed his camp 
<A NAME="175"></A>near to Scipio, and by pretending friendship, and putting him in hopes 
<A NAME="176"></A>of a peace, corrupted his army, and Scipio could not be made sensible of 
<A NAME="177"></A>this, although often forewarned of it by Sertorius- at last he utterly 
<A NAME="178"></A>despaired of Rome, and hasted into Spain, that by taking possession there 
<A NAME="179"></A>beforehand, he might secure a refuge to his friends from their misfortunes 
<A NAME="180"></A>at home. Having bad weather in his journey, and travelling through mountainous 
<A NAME="181"></A>countries, and the inhabitants stopping the way, and demanding a toll and 
<A NAME="182"></A>money for passage, those who were with him were out of all patience at 
<A NAME="183"></A>the indignity and shame it would be for a proconsul of Rome to pay tribute 
<A NAME="184"></A>to a crew of wretched barbarians. But he little regarded their censure, 
<A NAME="185"></A>and slighting that which had only the appearance of an indecency, told 
<A NAME="186"></A>them he must buy time, the most precious of all things to those who go 
<A NAME="187"></A>upon great enterprises; and pacifying the barbarous people with money, 
<A NAME="188"></A>he hastened his journey, and took possession of Spain, a country flourishing 
<A NAME="189"></A>and populous, abounding with young men fit to bear arms; but on account 
<A NAME="190"></A>of the insolence and covetousness of the governors from time to time sent 
<A NAME="191"></A>thither from Rome they had generally an aversion to Roman supremacy. He, 
<A NAME="192"></A>however, soon gained the affection of their nobles by intercourse with 
<A NAME="193"></A>them, and the good opinion of the people by remitting their taxes. But 
<A NAME="194"></A>that which won him most popularity was his exempting them from finding 
<A NAME="195"></A>lodgings for the soldiers, when he commanded his army to take up their 
<A NAME="196"></A>winter quarters outside the cities, and to pitch their camp in the suburbs; 
<A NAME="197"></A>and when he himself, first of all, caused his own tent to be raised without 
<A NAME="198"></A>the walls. Yet not being willing to rely totally upon the good inclination 
<A NAME="199"></A>of the inhabitants he armed all the Romans who lived in those countries 
<A NAME="200"></A>that were of military age, and undertook the building of ships and the 
<A NAME="201"></A>making of all sorts of warlike engines, by which means he kept the cities 
<A NAME="202"></A>in due obedience, showing himself gentle in all peaceful business, and 
<A NAME="203"></A>at the same time formidable to his enemies by his great preparations for 
<A NAME="204"></A>war.
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR>As soon as he was informed that Sylla had made himself master of 
<A NAME="206"></A>Rome, and that the party which sided with Marius and Carbo was going to 
<A NAME="207"></A>destruction, he expected that some commander with a considerable army would 
<A NAME="208"></A>speedily come against him, and therefore sent away Julius Salinator immediately, 
<A NAME="209"></A>with six thousand men fully armed, to fortify and defend the passes of 
<A NAME="210"></A>the Pyrenees. And Caius Annius not long after being sent out by Sylla, 
<A NAME="211"></A>finding Julius unassailable, sat down short at the foot of the mountains 
<A NAME="212"></A>in perplexity. But a certain Calpurnius, surnamed Lanarius, having treacherously 
<A NAME="213"></A>slain Julius, and his soldiers then forsaking the heights of the Pyrenees, 
<A NAME="214"></A>Caius Annius advanced with large numbers and drove before him all who endeavoured 
<A NAME="215"></A>to hinder his march. Sertorius, also, not being strong enough to give him 
<A NAME="216"></A>battle, retreated with three thousand men into New Carthage, where he took 
<A NAME="217"></A>shipping, and crossed the seas into Africa. And coming near the coast of 
<A NAME="218"></A>Mauritania, his men went on shore to water, and straggling about negligently, 
<A NAME="219"></A>the natives fell upon them and slew a great number. This new misfortune 
<A NAME="220"></A>forced him to sail back again into Spain, whence he was also repulsed, 
<A NAME="221"></A>and, some Cilician private ships joining with him, they made for the island 
<A NAME="222"></A>of Pityussa, where they landed and overpowered the garrison placed there 
<A NAME="223"></A>by Annius, who, however, came not long after with a great fleet of ships 
<A NAME="224"></A>and five thousand soldiers. And Sertorius made ready to fight him by sea, 
<A NAME="225"></A>although his ships were not built for strength, but for lightness and swift 
<A NAME="226"></A>sailing; but a violent west wind raised such a sea that many of them were 
<A NAME="227"></A>run aground and shipwrecked, and he himself, with a few vessels, being 
<A NAME="228"></A>kept from putting further out to sea by the fury of the weather, and from 
<A NAME="229"></A>landing by the power of his enemies, were tossed about painfully for ten 
<A NAME="230"></A>days together, amidst the boisterous and adverse waves.
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR>He escaped with difficulty, and after the wind ceased, ran for 
<A NAME="232"></A>certain desert islands scattered in those seas, affording no water, and 
<A NAME="233"></A>after passing a night there, making out to sea again, he went through the 
<A NAME="234"></A>straits of Cadiz, and sailing outward, keeping the Spanish shore on his 
<A NAME="235"></A>right hand, landed a little above the mouth of the river Baetis, where 
<A NAME="236"></A>it falls into the Atlantic Sea, and gives the name to that part of Spain. 
<A NAME="237"></A>Here he met with seamen recently arrived from the Atlantic islands, two 
<A NAME="238"></A>in number, divided from one another only by a narrow channel, and distant 
<A NAME="239"></A>from the coast of Africa ten thousand furlongs. These are called the Islands 
<A NAME="240"></A>of the Blest; rain falls there seldom, and in moderate showers, but for 
<A NAME="241"></A>the most part they have gentle breezes, bringing along with them soft dews, 
<A NAME="242"></A>which render the soil not only rich for ploughing and planting, but so 
<A NAME="243"></A>abundantly fruitful that it produces spontaneously an abundance of delicate 
<A NAME="244"></A>fruits, sufficient to feed the inhabitants, who may here enjoy all things 
<A NAME="245"></A>without trouble or labour. The seasons of the year are temperate, and the 
<A NAME="246"></A>transitions from one to another so moderate that the air is almost always 
<A NAME="247"></A>serene and pleasant. The rough northerly and easterly winds which blow 
<A NAME="248"></A>from the coasts of Europe and Africa, dissipated in the vast open space, 
<A NAME="249"></A>utterly lose their force before they reach the islands. The soft western 
<A NAME="250"></A>and southerly winds which breathe upon them sometimes produce gentle sprinkling 
<A NAME="251"></A>showers, which they convey along with them from the sea, but more usually 
<A NAME="252"></A>bring days of moist, bright weather, cooling and gently fertilizing the 
<A NAME="253"></A>soil, so that the firm belief prevails, even among the barbarians, that 
<A NAME="254"></A>this is the seat of the blessed and that these are the Elysian Fields celebrated 
<A NAME="255"></A>by Homer.
<A NAME="256"></A><BR><BR>When Sertorius heard this account, he was seized with a wonderful 
<A NAME="257"></A>passion for these islands, and had an extreme desire to go and live there 
<A NAME="258"></A>in peace and quietness, and safe from oppression and unending wars; but 
<A NAME="259"></A>his inclinations being perceived by the Cilician pirates, who desired not 
<A NAME="260"></A>peace nor quiet, but riches and spoils, they immediately forsook him and 
<A NAME="261"></A>sailed away into Africa to assist Ascalis, the son of Iphtha, and to help 
<A NAME="262"></A>to restore him to his kingdom of Mauritania. Their sudden departure noways 
<A NAME="263"></A>discouraged Sertorius; he presently resolved to assist the enemies of Ascalis, 
<A NAME="264"></A>and by this new adventure trusted to keep his soldiers together. who from 
<A NAME="265"></A>this might conceive new hopes, and a prospect of a new scene of action. 
<A NAME="266"></A>His arrival in Mauritania being very acceptable to the Moors, he lost no 
<A NAME="267"></A>time, but immediately giving battle to Ascalis, beat him out of the field 
<A NAME="268"></A>and besieged him; and Paccianus being sent by Sylla, with a powerful supply, 
<A NAME="269"></A>to raise the siege, Sertorius slew him in the field, gained over all his 
<A NAME="270"></A>forces, and took the city of Tingis, into which Ascalis and his brothers 
<A NAME="271"></A>were fled for refuge. The Africans tell that Antaeus was buried in this 
<A NAME="272"></A>city, and Sertorius had the grave opened, doubting the story because of 
<A NAME="273"></A>the prodigious size, and finding there his body, in effect, it is said, 
<A NAME="274"></A>full sixty cubits long, he was infinitely astonished, offered sacrifice, 
<A NAME="275"></A>and heaped up the tomb again, gave his confirmation to the story, and added 
<A NAME="276"></A>new honours to the memory of Antaeus. The Africans tell that after the 
<A NAME="277"></A>death of Antaeus, his wife Tinga lived with Hercules, and had a son by 
<A NAME="278"></A>him called Sophax, who was king of these countries, and gave his mother's 
<A NAME="279"></A>name to this city, whose son, also, was Diodorus, a great conqueror, who 
<A NAME="280"></A>brought the greatest part of the Libyan tribes under his subjection, with 
<A NAME="281"></A>an army of Greeks, raised out of the colonies of the Olbians and Myceneans 
<A NAME="282"></A>placed here by Hercules. Thus much I may mention for the sake of King Juba, 
<A NAME="283"></A>of all monarchs the greatest student of history whose ancestors are said 
<A NAME="284"></A>to have sprung from Diodorus and Sophax.
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>When Sertorius had made himself absolute master of the whole country, 
<A NAME="286"></A>he acted with great fairness to those who had confided in him, and who 
<A NAME="287"></A>yielded to his mercy; he restored to them their property, cities, and government, 
<A NAME="288"></A>accepting only of such acknowledgments as they themselves freely offered. 
<A NAME="289"></A>And whilst he considered which way next to turn his arms, the Lusitanians 
<A NAME="290"></A>sent ambassadors to desire him to be their general; for being terrified 
<A NAME="291"></A>with the Roman power, and finding the necessity of having a commander of 
<A NAME="292"></A>great authority and experience in war, being also sufficiently assured 
<A NAME="293"></A>of his worth and valour by those who had formerly known him, they were 
<A NAME="294"></A>desirous to commit themselves especially to his care. And in fact Sertorius 
<A NAME="295"></A>is said to have been of a temper unassailable either by fear or pleasure, 
<A NAME="296"></A>in adversity and dangers undaunted, and noways puffed up with prosperity. 
<A NAME="297"></A>In straightforward fighting, no commander in his time was more bold and 
<A NAME="298"></A>daring, and in whatever was to be performed in war by stratagem, secrecy, 
<A NAME="299"></A>or surprise, if any strong place was to be secured, any pass to be gained 
<A NAME="300"></A>speedily, for deceiving and overreaching an enemy, there was no man equal 
<A NAME="301"></A>to him in subtlety and skill. In bestowing rewards and conferring honours 
<A NAME="302"></A>upon those who had performed good service in the wars, he was bountiful 
<A NAME="303"></A>and magnificent, and was no less sparing and moderate in inflicting punishment. 
<A NAME="304"></A>It is true that that piece of harshness and cruelty which he executed in 
<A NAME="305"></A>the latter part of his days upon the Spanish hostages seems to argue that 
<A NAME="306"></A>his clemency was not natural to him, but only worn as a dress, and employed 
<A NAME="307"></A>upon calculation, as his occasion or necessity required. As to my own opinion, 
<A NAME="308"></A>I am persuaded that pure virtue, established by reason and judgment, can 
<A NAME="309"></A>never be totally perverted or changed into its opposite, by any misfortune 
<A NAME="310"></A>whatever. Yet I think it at the same time possible that virtuous inclinations 
<A NAME="311"></A>and natural good qualities may, when unworthily oppressed by calamities, 
<A NAME="312"></A>show, with change of fortune, some change and alteration of their temper; 
<A NAME="313"></A>and thus I conceive it happened to Sertorius, who, when prosperity failed 
<A NAME="314"></A>him, became exasperated by his disasters against those who had done him 
<A NAME="315"></A>wrong.
<A NAME="316"></A><BR><BR>The Lusitanians having sent for Sertorius, he left Africa, and 
<A NAME="317"></A>being made general with absolute authority, he put all in order amongst 
<A NAME="318"></A>them, and brought the neighbouring parts of Spain under subjection. Most 
<A NAME="319"></A>of the tribes voluntarily submitted themselves, won by the fame of his 
<A NAME="320"></A>clemency and of his courage, and, to some extent, also, he availed himself 
<A NAME="321"></A>of cunning artifices of his own devising to impose upon them and gain influence 
<A NAME="322"></A>over them. Amongst which, certainly, that of the hind was not the least. 
<A NAME="323"></A>Spanus, a countryman who lived in those parts, meeting by chance a hind 
<A NAME="324"></A>that had recently calved, flying from the hunters, let the dam go, and 
<A NAME="325"></A>pursuing the fawn, took it, being wonderfully pleased with the rarity of 
<A NAME="326"></A>the colour, which was all milk-white. As at that time Sertorius was living 
<A NAME="327"></A>in the neighbourhood, and accepted gladly any presents of fruit, fowl, 
<A NAME="328"></A>or venison that the country afforded, and rewarded liberally those who 
<A NAME="329"></A>presented them, the countryman brought him his young hind, which he took 
<A NAME="330"></A>and was well pleased with at the first sight; but when in time he had made 
<A NAME="331"></A>it so tame and gentle that it would come when he called, and follow him 
<A NAME="332"></A>wheresoever he went, and could endure the noise and tumult of the camp, 
<A NAME="333"></A>knowing well that uncivilized people are naturally prone to superstition, 
<A NAME="334"></A>by little and little he raised it into something preternatural, saying 
<A NAME="335"></A>that it was given him by the goddess Diana, and that it revealed to him 
<A NAME="336"></A>many secrets. He added, also, further contrivances. If he had received 
<A NAME="337"></A>at any time private intelligence that the enemies had made an incursion 
<A NAME="338"></A>into any part of the districts under his command, or had solicited any 
<A NAME="339"></A>city to revolt, he pretended that the hind had informed him of it in his 
<A NAME="340"></A>sleep, and charged him to keep his forces in readiness. Or if again he 
<A NAME="341"></A>had noticed that any of the commanders under him had got a victory, he 
<A NAME="342"></A>would hide the messengers and bring forth the hind crowned with flowers, 
<A NAME="343"></A>for joy of the good news that was to come, and would encourage them to 
<A NAME="344"></A>rejoice and sacrifice to the gods for the good account they should soon 
<A NAME="345"></A>receive of their prosperous success.
<A NAME="346"></A><BR><BR>By such practices, he brought them to be more tractable and obedient 
<A NAME="347"></A>in all things; for now they thought themselves no longer to be led by a 
<A NAME="348"></A>stranger, but rather conducted by a god, and the more so, as the facts 
<A NAME="349"></A>themselves seemed to bear witness to it, his power, contrary to all expectation 
<A NAME="350"></A>or probability, continually increasing. For with two thousand six hundred 
<A NAME="351"></A>men, whom for honour's sake he called Romans, combined with seven hundred 
<A NAME="352"></A>Africans, who landed with him when he first entered Lusitania, together 
<A NAME="353"></A>with four thousand targeteers and seven hundred horse of the Lusitanians 
<A NAME="354"></A>themselves, he made war against four Roman generals, who commanded a hundred 
<A NAME="355"></A>and twenty thousand foot, six thousand horse, two thousand archers and 
<A NAME="356"></A>slingers, and had cities innumerable in their power; whereas at the first 
<A NAME="357"></A>he had not above twenty cities in all. From this weak and slender beginning, 
<A NAME="358"></A>he raised himself to the command of large nations of men, and the possession 
<A NAME="359"></A>of numerous cities; and of the Roman commanders who were sent against him, 
<A NAME="360"></A>he overthrew Cotta in a sea-fight, in the channel near the town of Mellaria; 
<A NAME="361"></A>he routed Fufidius, the governor of Baetica, with the loss of two thousand 
<A NAME="362"></A>Romans, near the banks of the river Baetis; Lucius Domitius, proconsul 
<A NAME="363"></A>of the other province of Spain, was overthrown by one of his lieutenants; 
<A NAME="364"></A>Thoranius, another commander sent against him by Metellus with a great 
<A NAME="365"></A>force, was slain, and Metellus, one of the greatest and most approved Roman 
<A NAME="366"></A>generals then living, by a series of defeats, was reduced to such extremities, 
<A NAME="367"></A>that Lucius Manlius came to his assistance out of Gallia Narbonensis, and 
<A NAME="368"></A>Pompey the Great was sent from Rome itself in all haste with considerable 
<A NAME="369"></A>forces. Nor did Metellus know which way to turn himself, in a war with 
<A NAME="370"></A>such a bold and ready commander, who was continually molesting him, and 
<A NAME="371"></A>yet could not be brought to a set battle, but by the swiftness and dexterity 
<A NAME="372"></A>of his Spanish soldiery was enabled to shift and adapt himself to any change 
<A NAME="373"></A>of circumstances. Metellus had had experience in battles fought by regular 
<A NAME="374"></A>legions of soldiers, fully armed and drawn up in due order into a heavy 
<A NAME="375"></A>standing phalanx, admirably trained for encountering and overpowering an 
<A NAME="376"></A>enemy who came to close combat, hand to hand, but entirely unfit for climbing 
<A NAME="377"></A>among the hills, and competing incessantly with the swift attacks and retreats 
<A NAME="378"></A>of a set of fleet mountaineers, or to endure hunger and thirst and live 
<A NAME="379"></A>exposed like them to the wind and weather, without fire or 
<A NAME="380"></A>covering.
<A NAME="381"></A><BR><BR>Besides, being now in years, and having been formerly engaged in 
<A NAME="382"></A>many fights and dangerous conflicts, he had grown inclined to a more remiss, 
<A NAME="383"></A>easy, and luxurious life, and was the less able to contend with Sertorius 
<A NAME="384"></A>who was in the prime of his strength and vigour, and had a body wonderfully 
<A NAME="385"></A>fitted for war, being strong, active, and temperate, continually accustomed 
<A NAME="386"></A>to endure hard labour, to take long, tedious journeys, to pass many nights 
<A NAME="387"></A>together without sleep, to eat little, and to be satisfied with very coarse 
<A NAME="388"></A>fare, and who was never stained with the least excess in wine, even when 
<A NAME="389"></A>he was most at leisure. What leisure time he allowed himself he spent in 
<A NAME="390"></A>hunting and riding about, and so made himself thoroughly acquainted with 
<A NAME="391"></A>every passage for escape when he would fly, and for overtaking and intercepting 
<A NAME="392"></A>a pursuit, and gained a perfect knowledge of where he could and where he 
<A NAME="393"></A>could not go. Insomuch that Metellus suffered all the inconveniences of 
<A NAME="394"></A>defeat, although he earnestly desired to fight, and Sertorius, though he 
<A NAME="395"></A>refused the field, reaped all the advantages of a conqueror. For he hindered 
<A NAME="396"></A>them from foraging, and cut them off from water; if they advanced, he was 
<A NAME="397"></A>nowhere to be found; if they stayed in any place and encamped, he continually 
<A NAME="398"></A>molested and alarmed them; if they besieged any town, he presently appeared 
<A NAME="399"></A>and besieged them again, and put them to extremities for want of necessaries. 
<A NAME="400"></A>Thus he so wearied out the Roman army that when Sertorius challenged Metellus 
<A NAME="401"></A>to fight singly with him, they commended it, and cried out it was a fair 
<A NAME="402"></A>offer, a Roman to fight against a Roman, and a general against a general; 
<A NAME="403"></A>and when Metellus refused the challenge, they reproached him. Metellus 
<A NAME="404"></A>derided and contemned this, and rightly so; for, as Theophrastus observes, 
<A NAME="405"></A>a general should die like a general, and not like a skirmisher. But perceiving 
<A NAME="406"></A>that the town of the Langobritae, which gave great assistance to Sertorius, 
<A NAME="407"></A>might easily be taken for want of water, as there was but one well within 
<A NAME="408"></A>the walls, and the besieger would be master of the springs and fountains 
<A NAME="409"></A>in the suburbs, he advanced against the place, expecting to carry it in 
<A NAME="410"></A>two days' time, there being no more water, and gave command to his soldiers 
<A NAME="411"></A>to take five days' provision only. Sertorius, however, resolving to send 
<A NAME="412"></A>speedy relief, ordered two thousand skins to be filled with water, naming 
<A NAME="413"></A>a considerable sum of money for the carriage of every skin; and many Spaniards 
<A NAME="414"></A>and Moors undertaking the work, he chose out those who were the strongest 
<A NAME="415"></A>and swiftest of foot, and sent them through the mountains, with order that 
<A NAME="416"></A>when they had delivered the water, they should convey away privately all 
<A NAME="417"></A>those who would be least serviceable in the siege, that there might be 
<A NAME="418"></A>water sufficient for the defendants. As soon as Metellus understood this, 
<A NAME="419"></A>he was disturbed, as he had already consumed most part of the necessary 
<A NAME="420"></A>provisions for his army, but he sent out Aquinus with six thousand soldiers 
<A NAME="421"></A>to fetch in fresh supplies. But Sertorius having notice of it, laid an 
<A NAME="422"></A>ambush for him, and having sent out beforehand three thousand men to take 
<A NAME="423"></A>post in a thickly wooded water-course, with these he attacked the rear 
<A NAME="424"></A>of Aquinus in his return, while he himself, charging him in the front, 
<A NAME="425"></A>destroyed part of his army, and took the rest prisoners, Aquinus only escaping, 
<A NAME="426"></A>after the loss of both his horse and his armour. And Metellus, being forced 
<A NAME="427"></A>shamefully to raise the siege, withdrew amidst the laughter and contempt 
<A NAME="428"></A>of the Spaniards; while Sertorius became yet more the object of their esteem 
<A NAME="429"></A>and admiration.
<A NAME="430"></A><BR><BR>He was also highly honoured for his introducing discipline and 
<A NAME="431"></A>good order amongst them, for he altered their furious savage manner of 
<A NAME="432"></A>fighting, and brought them to make use of the Roman armour, taught them 
<A NAME="433"></A>to keep their ranks, and observe signals and watchwards; and out of a confused 
<A NAME="434"></A>number of thieves and robbers he constituted a regular, well-disciplined 
<A NAME="435"></A>army. He bestowed silver and gold upon them liberally to gild and adorn 
<A NAME="436"></A>their helmets, he had their shields worked with various figures and designs, 
<A NAME="437"></A>he brought them into the mode of wearing flowered and embroidered cloaks 
<A NAME="438"></A>and coats, and by supplying money for these purposes, and joining with 
<A NAME="439"></A>them in all improvements, he won the hearts of all. That, however, which 
<A NAME="440"></A>delighted them most was the care that he took of their children. He sent 
<A NAME="441"></A>for all the boys of noblest parentage out of all their tribes, and placed 
<A NAME="442"></A>them in the great city of Osca, where he appointed masters to instruct 
<A NAME="443"></A>them in the Grecian and Roman learning. that when they came to be men, 
<A NAME="444"></A>they might, as he professed, be fitted to share with him in authority, 
<A NAME="445"></A>and in conducting the government, although under this pretext he really 
<A NAME="446"></A>made them hostages. However, their fathers were wonderfully pleased to 
<A NAME="447"></A>see their children going daily to the schools in good order, handsomely 
<A NAME="448"></A>dressed in gowns edged with purple, and that Sertorius paid for their lessons, 
<A NAME="449"></A>examined them often, distributed rewards to the most deserving, and gave 
<A NAME="450"></A>them the golden bosses to hang about their necks, which the Romans called 
<A NAME="451"></A>bullae.
<A NAME="452"></A><BR><BR>There being a custom in Spain that when a commander was slain in 
<A NAME="453"></A>battle, those who attended his person fought it out till they all died 
<A NAME="454"></A>with him, which the inhabitants of those countries called an offering, 
<A NAME="455"></A>or libation, there were few commanders that had any considerable guard 
<A NAME="456"></A>or number of attendants; but Sertorius was followed by many thousands who 
<A NAME="457"></A>offered themselves, and vowed to spend their blood with his. And it is 
<A NAME="458"></A>told that when his army was defeated near a city in Spain, and the enemy 
<A NAME="459"></A>pressed hard upon them, the Spaniards, with no care for themselves, but 
<A NAME="460"></A>being totally solicitous to save Sertorius, took him upon their shoulders 
<A NAME="461"></A>and passed him from one to another, till they carried him into the city, 
<A NAME="462"></A>and only when they had thus placed their general in safety, provided afterwards 
<A NAME="463"></A>each man for his own security.
<A NAME="464"></A><BR><BR>Nor were the Spaniards alone ambitious to serve him, but the Roman 
<A NAME="465"></A>soldiers, also, that came out of Italy, were impatient to be under his 
<A NAME="466"></A>command; and when Perpenna Vento, who was of the same faction with Sertorius, 
<A NAME="467"></A>came into Spain with a quantity of money and a large number of troops, 
<A NAME="468"></A>and designed to make war against Metellus on his own account, his own soldiers 
<A NAME="469"></A>opposed it, and talked continually of Sertorius, much to the mortification 
<A NAME="470"></A>of Perpenna, who was puffed up with the grandeur of his family and his 
<A NAME="471"></A>riches. And when they afterwards received tidings that Pompey was passing 
<A NAME="472"></A>the Pyrenees, they took up their arms laid hold on their ensigns, called 
<A NAME="473"></A>upon Perpenna to lead them to Sertorius, and threatened him that if he 
<A NAME="474"></A>refused they would go without him and place themselves under a commander 
<A NAME="475"></A>who was able to defend himself and those that served him. And so Perpenna 
<A NAME="476"></A>was obliged to yield to their desires, and joining Sertorius, added to 
<A NAME="477"></A>his army three-and-fifty cohorts.
<A NAME="478"></A><BR><BR>When now all the cities on this side of the river Ebro also united 
<A NAME="479"></A>their forces together under his command, his army grew great, for they 
<A NAME="480"></A>flocked together and flowed in upon him from all quarters. But when they 
<A NAME="481"></A>continually cried out to attack the enemy, and were impatient of delay, 
<A NAME="482"></A>their inexperienced, disorderly rashness caused Sertorius much trouble, 
<A NAME="483"></A>who at first strove to restrain them with reason and good counsel; but 
<A NAME="484"></A>when he perceived them refractory and unseasonably violent, he gave way 
<A NAME="485"></A>to their impetuous desires, and permitted them to engage with the enemy, 
<A NAME="486"></A>in such sort that they might, being repulsed, yet not totally routed become 
<A NAME="487"></A>more obedient to his commands for the future. Which happening as he had 
<A NAME="488"></A>anticipated, he soon rescued them, and brought them safe into his camp. 
<A NAME="489"></A>After a few days, being willing to encourage them again, when he had called 
<A NAME="490"></A>all his army together, he caused two horses to be brought into the field, 
<A NAME="491"></A>one old, feeble, lean animal the other a lusty, strong horse, with a remarkably 
<A NAME="492"></A>thick and long tail. Near the lean one he placed a tall, strong man, and 
<A NAME="493"></A>near the strong young horse a weak, despicable-looking fellow; and at a 
<A NAME="494"></A>sign given, the strong man took hold of the weak horse's tail with both 
<A NAME="495"></A>his hands, and drew it to him with his whole force, as if he would pull 
<A NAME="496"></A>it off; the other, the weak man, in the meantime, set to work to pluck 
<A NAME="497"></A>off hair by hair from the great horse's tail. When the strong man had given 
<A NAME="498"></A>trouble enough to himself in vain, and sufficient diversion to the company, 
<A NAME="499"></A>and had abandoned his attempt, whilst the weak, pitiful fellow in a short 
<A NAME="500"></A>time and with little pains had left not a hair on the great horse's tail, 
<A NAME="501"></A>Sertorius rose up and spoke to his army. "You see, fellow-soldiers, that 
<A NAME="502"></A>perseverance is more prevailing than violence, and that many things which 
<A NAME="503"></A>cannot be overcome when they are together, yield themselves up when taken 
<A NAME="504"></A>little by little. Assiduity and persistence are irresistible, and in time 
<A NAME="505"></A>overthrow and destroy the greatest powers whatever. Time being the favourable 
<A NAME="506"></A>friend and assistant of those who use their judgment to await his occasions, 
<A NAME="507"></A>and the destructive enemy of those who are unreasonably urging and pressing 
<A NAME="508"></A>forward." With a frequent use of such words and such devices, he soothed 
<A NAME="509"></A>the fierceness of the barbarous people, and taught them to attend and watch 
<A NAME="510"></A>for their opportunities.
<A NAME="511"></A><BR><BR>Of all his remarkable exploits, none raised greater admiration 
<A NAME="512"></A>than that which he put in practice against the Characitanians. These are 
<A NAME="513"></A>a people beyond the river Tagus, who inhabit neither cities nor towns, 
<A NAME="514"></A>but live in a vast high hill, within the deep dens and caves of the rocks, 
<A NAME="515"></A>the mouths of which open all towards the north. The country below is of 
<A NAME="516"></A>a soil resembling a light clay, so loose as easily to break into powder, 
<A NAME="517"></A>and is not firm enough to bear any one that treads upon it, and if you 
<A NAME="518"></A>touch it in the least it flies about like ashes or unslacked lime. In any 
<A NAME="519"></A>danger of war, these people descended into their caves, and carrying in 
<A NAME="520"></A>their booty and prey along with them, stayed quietly within, secure from 
<A NAME="521"></A>every attack. And when Sertorius, leaving Metellus some distance off, had 
<A NAME="522"></A>placed his camp near this hill, they slighted and despised him, imagining 
<A NAME="523"></A>that he retired into these parts, being overthrown by the Romans. And whether 
<A NAME="524"></A>out of anger or resentment, or out of his unwillingness to be thought to 
<A NAME="525"></A>fly from his enemies, early in the morning he rode up to view the situation 
<A NAME="526"></A>of the place. But finding there was no way to come at it, as he rode about, 
<A NAME="527"></A>threatening them in vain and disconcerted, he took notice that the wind 
<A NAME="528"></A>raised the dust and carried it up towards the caves of the Characitanians, 
<A NAME="529"></A>the mouths of which, as I said before, opened towards the north; and the 
<A NAME="530"></A>northern wind, which some call Caecias, prevailing most in those parts, 
<A NAME="531"></A>coming up out of moist plains or mountains covered with snow, at this particular 
<A NAME="532"></A>time, in the heat of summer, being further supplied and increased by the 
<A NAME="533"></A>melting of the ice in the northern regions, blew a delightful fresh gale, 
<A NAME="534"></A>cooling and refreshing the Characitanians and their cattle all the day 
<A NAME="535"></A>long. Sertorius, considering well all circumstances in which either the 
<A NAME="536"></A>information of the inhabitants or his own experience had instructed him, 
<A NAME="537"></A>commanded his soldiers to shovel up a great quantity of this light, dusty 
<A NAME="538"></A>earth, to heap it up together, and make a mount of it over against the 
<A NAME="539"></A>hill in which those barbarous people resided, who, imagining that all this 
<A NAME="540"></A>preparation was for raising a mound to get at them, only mocked and laughed 
<A NAME="541"></A>at it. However, he continued the work till the evening, and brought his 
<A NAME="542"></A>soldiers back into their camp.
<A NAME="543"></A><BR><BR>The next morning a gentle breeze at first arose, and moved the 
<A NAME="544"></A>lightest parts of the earth and dispersed it about as the chaff before 
<A NAME="545"></A>the wind; but when the sun coming to be higher, the strong northerly wind 
<A NAME="546"></A>had covered the hills with the dust, the soldiers came and turned this 
<A NAME="547"></A>mound of earth over and over, and broke the hard clods in pieces, whilst 
<A NAME="548"></A>others on horseback rode through it backward and forward, and raised a 
<A NAME="549"></A>cloud of dust into the air: there with the wind the whole of it was carried 
<A NAME="550"></A>away and blown into the dwellings of the Characitanians, all lying open 
<A NAME="551"></A>to the north. And there being no other vent or breathing-place than that 
<A NAME="552"></A>through which the Caecias rushed in upon them, it quickly blinded their 
<A NAME="553"></A>eyes and filled their lungs, and all but choked them, whilst they strove 
<A NAME="554"></A>to draw in the rough air mingled with dust and powdered earth. Nor were 
<A NAME="555"></A>they able, with all they could do, to hold out above two days, but yielding 
<A NAME="556"></A>up themselves on the third, adding, by their defeat, not so much of the 
<A NAME="557"></A>power of Sertorius, as to his renown, in proving that he was able to conquer 
<A NAME="558"></A>places by art, which were impregnable by the force of 
<A NAME="559"></A>arms.
<A NAME="560"></A><BR><BR>So long as he had to do with Metellus, he was thought to owe his 
<A NAME="561"></A>successes to his opponent's age and slow temper, which were ill suited 
<A NAME="562"></A>for coping with the daring and activity of one who commanded a light army 
<A NAME="563"></A>more like a band of robbers than regular soldiers. But when Pompey also 
<A NAME="564"></A>passed over the Pyrenees, and Sertorius pitched his camp near him, and 
<A NAME="565"></A>offered and himself accepted every occasion by which military skill could 
<A NAME="566"></A>be put to the proof, and in this contest of dexterity was found to have 
<A NAME="567"></A>the better, both in baffling his enemy's designs and in counter-scheming 
<A NAME="568"></A>himself, the fame of him now spread even to Rome itself, as the most expert 
<A NAME="569"></A>commander of his time. For the renown of Pompey was not small, who had 
<A NAME="570"></A>already won much honour by his achievements in the wars of Sylla, from 
<A NAME="571"></A>whom he received the title of Magnus, and was called Pompey the Great; 
<A NAME="572"></A>and who had risen to the honour of a triumph before the beard had grown 
<A NAME="573"></A>on his face. And many cities which were under Sertorius were on the very 
<A NAME="574"></A>eve of revolting and going over to Pompey, when they were deterred from 
<A NAME="575"></A>it by that great action, amongst others, which he performed near the city 
<A NAME="576"></A>of Lauron, contrary to the expectation of all.
<A NAME="577"></A><BR><BR>For Sertorius had laid siege to Lauron, and Pompey came with his 
<A NAME="578"></A>whole army to relieve it; and there being a hill near this city very advantageously 
<A NAME="579"></A>situated, they both made haste to take it. Sertorius was beforehand, and 
<A NAME="580"></A>took possession of it first, and Pompey, having drawn down his forces, 
<A NAME="581"></A>was not sorry that it had thus happened, imagining that he had hereby enclosed 
<A NAME="582"></A>his enemy between his own army and the city, and sent in a messenger to 
<A NAME="583"></A>the citizens of Lauron, to bid them be of good courage, and to come upon 
<A NAME="584"></A>their walls, where they might see their besieger besieged. Sertorius, perceiving 
<A NAME="585"></A>their intentions, smiled, and said he would now teach Sylla's scholar, 
<A NAME="586"></A>for so he called Pompey in derision, that it was the part of a general 
<A NAME="587"></A>to look as well behind him as before him, and at the same time showed them 
<A NAME="588"></A>six thousand soldiers, whom he had left in his former camp, from whence 
<A NAME="589"></A>he marched out to take the hill, where, if Pompey should assault him, they 
<A NAME="590"></A>might fall upon his rear. Pompey discovered this too late and not daring 
<A NAME="591"></A>to give battle, for fear of being encompassed, and yet being ashamed to 
<A NAME="592"></A>desert his friends and confederates in their extreme danger, was thus forced 
<A NAME="593"></A>to sit still, and see them ruined before his face. For the besieged despaired 
<A NAME="594"></A>of relief, and delivered up themselves to Sertorius, who spared their lives 
<A NAME="595"></A>and granted them their liberty, but burnt their city, not out of anger 
<A NAME="596"></A>or cruelty, for of all commanders that ever were Sertorius seemed least 
<A NAME="597"></A>of all to have indulged these passions, but only for the greater shame 
<A NAME="598"></A>and confusion of the admirers of Pompey, and that it might be reported 
<A NAME="599"></A>amongst the Spaniards, that though he had been so close to the fire which 
<A NAME="600"></A>burnt down the city of his confederates as actually to feel the heat of 
<A NAME="601"></A>it, he still had not dared to make any opposition.
<A NAME="602"></A><BR><BR>Sertorius, however, sustained many losses; but he always maintained 
<A NAME="603"></A>himself and those immediately with him undefeated, and it was by other 
<A NAME="604"></A>commanders under him that he suffered; and he was more admired for being 
<A NAME="605"></A>able to repair his losses, and for recovering the victory, than the Roman 
<A NAME="606"></A>generals against him for gaining these advantages; as at the battle of 
<A NAME="607"></A>Sucro against Pompey, and at the battle near Tuttia, against him and Metellus 
<A NAME="608"></A>together. The battle near the Sucro was fought, it is said, through the 
<A NAME="609"></A>impatience of Pompey, lest Metellus should share with him in the victory, 
<A NAME="610"></A>Sertorius being also willing to engage Pompey before the arrival of Metellus, 
<A NAME="611"></A>Sertorius delayed the time till the evening, considering that the darkness 
<A NAME="612"></A>of the night would be a disadvantage to his enemies, whether flying or 
<A NAME="613"></A>pursuing, being strangers, and having no knowledge of the 
<A NAME="614"></A>country.
<A NAME="615"></A><BR><BR>When the fight began, it happened that Sertorius was not placed 
<A NAME="616"></A>directly against Pompey, but against Afranius, who had command of the left 
<A NAME="617"></A>wing of the Roman army, as he commanded the right wing of his own; but 
<A NAME="618"></A>when he understood that his left wing began to give way, and yield to the 
<A NAME="619"></A>assault of Pompey, he committed the care of his right wing to other commanders, 
<A NAME="620"></A>and made haste to relieve those in distress; and rallying some that were 
<A NAME="621"></A>flying, and encouraging others that still kept their ranks, he renewed 
<A NAME="622"></A>the fight, and attacked the enemy in their pursuit so effectively as to 
<A NAME="623"></A>cause a considerable rout, and brought Pompey into great danger of his 
<A NAME="624"></A>life. For after being wounded and losing his horse, he escaped unexpectedly. 
<A NAME="625"></A>For the Africans with Sertorius, who took Pompey's horse, set out with 
<A NAME="626"></A>gold, and covered with rich trappings, fell out with one another; and upon 
<A NAME="627"></A>the dividing of the spoil, gave over the pursuit. Afranius, in the meantime, 
<A NAME="628"></A>as soon as Sertorius had left his right wing, to assist the other part 
<A NAME="629"></A>of his army, overthrew all that opposed him; and pursuing them to their 
<A NAME="630"></A>camp, fell in together with them, and plundered them till it was dark night; 
<A NAME="631"></A>knowing nothing of Pompey's overthrow, nor being able to restrain his soldiers 
<A NAME="632"></A>from pillaging; when Sertorius, returning with victory, fell upon him and 
<A NAME="633"></A>upon his men, who were all in disorder, and slew many of them. And the 
<A NAME="634"></A>next morning he came into the field again well armed, and offered battle, 
<A NAME="635"></A>but perceiving that Metellus was near, he drew off, and returned to his 
<A NAME="636"></A>camp, saying, "If this old woman had not come up, I would have whipped 
<A NAME="637"></A>that boy soundly, and sent him to Rome."
<A NAME="638"></A><BR><BR>He was much concerned that his white hind could nowhere be found; 
<A NAME="639"></A>as he was thus destitute of an admirable contrivance to encourage the barbarous 
<A NAME="640"></A>people at a time when he most stood in need of it. Some men, however, wandering 
<A NAME="641"></A>in the night, chanced to meet her, and knowing her by her colour, took 
<A NAME="642"></A>her; to whom Sertorius promised a good reward, if they would tell no one 
<A NAME="643"></A>of it; and immediately shut her up. A few days after, he appeared in public 
<A NAME="644"></A>with a very cheerful look, and declared to the chief men of the country 
<A NAME="645"></A>that the gods had foretold him in a dream that some great good fortune 
<A NAME="646"></A>should shortly attend him; and, taking his seat, proceeded to answer the 
<A NAME="647"></A>petitions of those who applied themselves to him. The keepers of the hind, 
<A NAME="648"></A>who were not far off, now let her loose, and she no sooner espied Sertorius, 
<A NAME="649"></A>but she came leaping with great joy to his feet, laid her head upon his 
<A NAME="650"></A>knees, and licked his hands, as she formerly used to do. And Sertorius 
<A NAME="651"></A>stroking her, and making much of her again, with that tenderness that the 
<A NAME="652"></A>tears stood in his eyes, all that were present were immediately filled 
<A NAME="653"></A>with wonder and astonishment, and accompanying him to his house with loud 
<A NAME="654"></A>shouts for joy, looked upon him as a person above the rank of mortal men, 
<A NAME="655"></A>and highly beloved by the gods; and were great courage and hope for the 
<A NAME="656"></A>future.
<A NAME="657"></A><BR><BR>When he had reduced his enemies to the last extremity for want 
<A NAME="658"></A>of provision, he was forced to give them battle, in the plains near Saguntum, 
<A NAME="659"></A>to hinder them from foraging and plundering the country. Both parties fought 
<A NAME="660"></A>gloriously. Memmius, the best commander in Pompey's army, was slain in 
<A NAME="661"></A>the heat of the battle. Sertorius overthrew all before him, and with great 
<A NAME="662"></A>slaughter of his enemies pressed forward towards Metellus. This old commander, 
<A NAME="663"></A>making a resistance beyond what could be expected from one of his years, 
<A NAME="664"></A>was wounded with a lance an occurrence which filled all who either saw 
<A NAME="665"></A>it or heard of it with shame, to be thought to have left their general 
<A NAME="666"></A>in distress, but at the same time to provoke them to revenge and fury against 
<A NAME="667"></A>their enemies; they covered Metellus with their shields, and brought him 
<A NAME="668"></A>off in safety, and then valiantly repulsed the Spaniards; and so victory 
<A NAME="669"></A>changed sides, and Sertorius, that he might afford a more secure retreat 
<A NAME="670"></A>to his army, and that fresh forces might more easily be raised, retired 
<A NAME="671"></A>into a strong city in the mountains. And though it was the least of his 
<A NAME="672"></A>intention to sustain a long siege, yet he began to repair the walls, and 
<A NAME="673"></A>to fortify the gates, thus deluding his enemies, who came and sat down 
<A NAME="674"></A>before the town, hoping to take it without much resistance; and meantime 
<A NAME="675"></A>gave over the pursuit of the Spaniards, and allowed opportunity for raising 
<A NAME="676"></A>new forces for Sertorius, to which purpose he had sent commanders to all 
<A NAME="677"></A>their cities, with orders, when they had sufficiently increased their numbers, 
<A NAME="678"></A>to send him word of it. This news he no sooner received, but he sallied 
<A NAME="679"></A>out and forced his way through his enemies, and easily joined them with 
<A NAME="680"></A>the rest of his army. Having received this considerable reinforcement, 
<A NAME="681"></A>he set upon the Romans again, and by rapidly assaulting them, by alarming 
<A NAME="682"></A>them on all sides, by ensnaring, circumventing, and laying ambushes for 
<A NAME="683"></A>them, he cut off all provisions by land, while with his piratical vessels 
<A NAME="684"></A>he kept all the coast in awe, and hindered their supplies by sea. He thus 
<A NAME="685"></A>forced the Roman generals to dislodge and to separate from one another: 
<A NAME="686"></A>Metellus departed into Gaul, and Pompey wintered among the Vaccaeans, in 
<A NAME="687"></A>a wretched condition, where, being in extreme want of money, he wrote a 
<A NAME="688"></A>letter to the senate, to let them know that if they did not speedily support 
<A NAME="689"></A>him, he must draw off his army; for he had already spent his own money 
<A NAME="690"></A>in the defence of Italy. To these extremities, the chiefest and the most 
<A NAME="691"></A>powerful commanders of the age were reduced by the skill of Sertorius; 
<A NAME="692"></A>and it was the common opinion in Rome that he would be in Italy before 
<A NAME="693"></A>Pompey.
<A NAME="694"></A><BR><BR>How far Metellus was terrified and at what rate he esteemed him, 
<A NAME="695"></A>he plainly declared, when he offered by proclamation an hundred talents 
<A NAME="696"></A>and twenty thousand acres of land to any Roman that should kill him, and 
<A NAME="697"></A>leave, if he were banished, to return; attempting villainously to buy his 
<A NAME="698"></A>life by treachery, when he despaired of ever being able to overcome him 
<A NAME="699"></A>in open war. When once he gained the advantage in a battle against Sertorius, 
<A NAME="700"></A>he was so pleased and transported with his good fortune, that he caused 
<A NAME="701"></A>himself to be publicly proclaimed imperator; and all the cities which he 
<A NAME="702"></A>visited received him with altars and sacrifices; he allowed himself, it 
<A NAME="703"></A>is said, to have garlands placed on his head, and accepted sumptuous entertainments, 
<A NAME="704"></A>at which he sat drinking in triumphal robes, while images and figures of 
<A NAME="705"></A>victory were introduced by the motion of machines, bringing in with them 
<A NAME="706"></A>crowns and trophies of gold to present to him, and companies of young men 
<A NAME="707"></A>and women danced before him, and sang to him songs of joy and triumph. 
<A NAME="708"></A>By all which he rendered himself deservedly ridiculous, for being so excessively 
<A NAME="709"></A>delighted and puffed up with the thoughts of having followed one who was 
<A NAME="710"></A>retiring of his own accord, and for having once had the better of him whom 
<A NAME="711"></A>he used to call Sylla's runaway slave, and his forces, the remnant of the 
<A NAME="712"></A>defeated troops of Carbo.
<A NAME="713"></A><BR><BR>Sertorius, meantime, showed the loftiness of his temper in calling 
<A NAME="714"></A>together all the Roman senators who had fled from Rome, and had come and 
<A NAME="715"></A>resided with him, and giving them the name of a senate; and out of these 
<A NAME="716"></A>he chose praetors and quaestors, and adorned his government with all the 
<A NAME="717"></A>Roman laws and institutions. And though he made use of the arms, riches, 
<A NAME="718"></A>and cities of the Spaniards, yet he would never, even in word, remit to 
<A NAME="719"></A>them the imperial authority, but set Roman officers and commanders over 
<A NAME="720"></A>them, intimating his purpose to restore liberty to the Romans, not to raise 
<A NAME="721"></A>up the Spaniard's power against them. For he was a sincere lover of his 
<A NAME="722"></A>country, and had a great desire to return home; but in his adverse fortune 
<A NAME="723"></A>he showed undaunted courage, and behaved himself towards his enemies in 
<A NAME="724"></A>a manner free from all dejection and mean-spiritedness; and when he was 
<A NAME="725"></A>in his prosperity, and in the height of his victories, he sent word to 
<A NAME="726"></A>Metellus and Pompey that he was ready to lay down his arms and live a private 
<A NAME="727"></A>life if he were allowed to return home, declaring that he had rather live 
<A NAME="728"></A>as the meanest citizen in Rome than, exiled from it, be supreme commander 
<A NAME="729"></A>of all other cities together. And it is thought that his great desire for 
<A NAME="730"></A>his country was in no small measure promoted by the tenderness he had for 
<A NAME="731"></A>his mother, under whom he was brought up after the death of his father, 
<A NAME="732"></A>and upon whom he had placed his entire affection. After that his friends 
<A NAME="733"></A>had sent for him into Spain to be their general, as soon as he heard of 
<A NAME="734"></A>his mother's death he had almost cast away himself and died for grief; 
<A NAME="735"></A>for he lay seven days together continually in his tent, without giving 
<A NAME="736"></A>the word, or being seen by the nearest of his friends; and when the chief 
<A NAME="737"></A>commanders of the army and persons of the greatest note came about his 
<A NAME="738"></A>tent, with great difficulty they prevailed with him at last to come abroad, 
<A NAME="739"></A>and speak to his soldiers, and to take upon him the management of affairs, 
<A NAME="740"></A>which were in a prosperous condition. And thus, to many men's judgment, 
<A NAME="741"></A>he seemed to have been in himself of a mild and compassionate temper, and 
<A NAME="742"></A>naturally given to ease and quietness, and to have accepted of the command 
<A NAME="743"></A>of military forces contrary to his own inclination, and not being able 
<A NAME="744"></A>to live in safety otherwise, to have been driven by his enemies to have 
<A NAME="745"></A>recourse to arms, and to espouse the wars as a necessary guard for the 
<A NAME="746"></A>defence of his person.
<A NAME="747"></A><BR><BR>His negotiations with King Mithridates further argue the greatness 
<A NAME="748"></A>of his mind. For when Mithridates recovering himself from his overthrow 
<A NAME="749"></A>by Sylla, like a strong wrestler that gets up to try another fall, was 
<A NAME="750"></A>again endeavouring to re-establish his power in Asia, at this time the 
<A NAME="751"></A>great fame of Sertorius was celebrated in all places; and when the merchants 
<A NAME="752"></A>who came out of the western parts of Europe, bringing these, as it were, 
<A NAME="753"></A>among their other foreign wares, had filled the kingdom of Pontus with 
<A NAME="754"></A>their stories of his exploits in war, Mithridates was extremely desirous 
<A NAME="755"></A>to send an embassy to him, being also highly encouraged to it by the boastings 
<A NAME="756"></A>of his flattering courtiers, who, comparing Mithridates to Pyrrhus, and 
<A NAME="757"></A>Sertorius to Hannibal, professed that the Romans would never be able to 
<A NAME="758"></A>make any considerable resistance against such great forces, and such admirable 
<A NAME="759"></A>commanders, when they should be set upon on both sides at once, on one 
<A NAME="760"></A>by the most warlike general, and on the other by the most powerful prince 
<A NAME="761"></A>in existence.
<A NAME="762"></A><BR><BR>Accordingly, Mithridates sends ambassadors into Spain to Sertorius 
<A NAME="763"></A>with letters and instructions, and commission to promise ships and money 
<A NAME="764"></A>toward the charge of the war, if Sertorius would confirm his pretensions 
<A NAME="765"></A>upon Asia, and authorize to possess all that he had surrendered to the 
<A NAME="766"></A>Romans in his treaty with Sylla. Sertorius summoned a full council which 
<A NAME="767"></A>he called a senate, where, when others joyfully approved of the conditions, 
<A NAME="768"></A>and were desirous immediately to accept of his offer, seeing that he desired 
<A NAME="769"></A>nothing of them but a name, and an empty title to places not in their power 
<A NAME="770"></A>to dispose of, in recompense of which they should be supplied with what 
<A NAME="771"></A>they then stood most in need of, Sertorius would by no means agree to it; 
<A NAME="772"></A>declaring that he was willing that King Mithridates should exercise all 
<A NAME="773"></A>royal power and authority over Bithynia and Cappadocia, countries accustomed 
<A NAME="774"></A>to a monarchical government, and not belonging to Rome, but he could never 
<A NAME="775"></A>consent that he should seize or detain a province, which, by the justest 
<A NAME="776"></A>right and title, was possessed by the Romans, which Mithridates had formerly 
<A NAME="777"></A>taken away from them, and had afterwards lost in open war to Fimbria, and 
<A NAME="778"></A>quitted upon a treaty of peace with Sylla. For he looked upon it as his 
<A NAME="779"></A>duty to enlarge the Roman possessions by his conquering arms, and not to 
<A NAME="780"></A>increase his own power by the diminution of the Roman territories. Since 
<A NAME="781"></A>a noble-minded man, though he willingly accepts of victory when it comes 
<A NAME="782"></A>with honour, will never so much as endeavour to save his own life upon 
<A NAME="783"></A>any dishonourable terms.
<A NAME="784"></A><BR><BR>When this was related to Mithridates, he was struck with amazement, 
<A NAME="785"></A>and said to his intimate friends, "What will Sertorius enjoin us to do 
<A NAME="786"></A>when he comes to be seated in the Palatium in Rome, who at present, when 
<A NAME="787"></A>he is driven out to the borders of the Atlantic Sea, sets bounds to our 
<A NAME="788"></A>kingdoms in the east, and threatens us with war if we attempt the recovery 
<A NAME="789"></A>of Asia?" However, they solemnly, upon oath, concluded a league between 
<A NAME="790"></A>them, upon these terms: that Mithridates should enjoy the free possessions 
<A NAME="791"></A>of Cappadocia and Bithynia, and that Sertorius should send him soldiers 
<A NAME="792"></A>and a general for his army, in recompense of which the king was to supply 
<A NAME="793"></A>him with three thousand talents and forty ships. Marcus Marius, a Roman 
<A NAME="794"></A>senator who had quitted Rome to follow Sertorius, was sent general into 
<A NAME="795"></A>Asia, in company with whom, when Mithridates had reduced divers of the 
<A NAME="796"></A>Asian cities, Marius made his entrance with rods and axes carried before 
<A NAME="797"></A>him, and Mithridates followed in the second place, voluntarily waiting 
<A NAME="798"></A>upon him. Some of these cities he set at liberty, and others he freed from 
<A NAME="799"></A>taxes, signifying to them that these privileges were granted to them by 
<A NAME="800"></A>the favour of Sertorius, and hereby Asia, which had been miserably tormented 
<A NAME="801"></A>by the revenue farmers, and oppressed by the insolent pride and covetousness 
<A NAME="802"></A>of the soldiers, began to rise again to new hopes and to look forward with 
<A NAME="803"></A>joy to the expected change of government.
<A NAME="804"></A><BR><BR>But in Spain, the senators about Sertorius, and others of the nobility, 
<A NAME="805"></A>finding themselves strong enough for their enemies, no sooner laid aside 
<A NAME="806"></A>fear, but their minds were possessed by envy and irrational jealousies 
<A NAME="807"></A>of Sertorius's power. And chiefly Perpenna, elevated by the thoughts of 
<A NAME="808"></A>his noble birth, and carried away with a fond ambition of commanding the 
<A NAME="809"></A>army, threw out villainous discourses in private amongst his acquaintance. 
<A NAME="810"></A>"What evil genius," he would say, "hurries us perpetually from worse to 
<A NAME="811"></A>worse? We who disdained to obey the dictates of Sylla, the ruler of the 
<A NAME="812"></A>sea and land, and thus to live at home in peace and quiet, are come hither 
<A NAME="813"></A>to our destruction, hoping to enjoy our liberty, and have made ourselves 
<A NAME="814"></A>slaves of our own accord; and are become the contemptible guards and attendants 
<A NAME="815"></A>of the banished Sertorius, who, that he may expose us the further, gives 
<A NAME="816"></A>us a name that renders us ridiculous to all that hear it, and calls us 
<A NAME="817"></A>the Senate, when at the same time he makes us undergo as much hard labour, 
<A NAME="818"></A>and forces us to be as subject to his haughty commands and insolences, 
<A NAME="819"></A>as any Spaniards and Lusitanians." With these mutinous discourses he seduced 
<A NAME="820"></A>them; and though the greater number could not be led into open rebellion 
<A NAME="821"></A>against Sertorius, fearing his power, they were prevailed with to endeavour 
<A NAME="822"></A>to destroy his interest secretly. For by abusing the Lusitanians and Spaniards, 
<A NAME="823"></A>by inflicting severe punishments upon them, by raising exorbitant taxes, 
<A NAME="824"></A>and by pretending that all this was done by the strict command of Sertorius, 
<A NAME="825"></A>they caused great troubles, and made many cities to revolt; and those who 
<A NAME="826"></A>were sent to mitigate and heal these differences did rather exasperate 
<A NAME="827"></A>them, and increase the number of his enemies, and left them at their return 
<A NAME="828"></A>more obstinate and rebellious than they found them. And Sertorius, incensed 
<A NAME="829"></A>with all this, now so far forgot his former clemency and goodness as to 
<A NAME="830"></A>lay hands on the sons of the Spaniards educated in the city of Osca; and, 
<A NAME="831"></A>contrary to all justice, he cruelly put some of them to death, and sold 
<A NAME="832"></A>others.
<A NAME="833"></A><BR><BR>In the meantime, Perpenna, having increased the number of his conspirators, 
<A NAME="834"></A>drew in Manlius, a commander in the army, who, at that time being attached 
<A NAME="835"></A>to a youth, to gain his affections the more, discovered the confederacy 
<A NAME="836"></A>to him, bidding him neglect others, and be constant to him alone; who, 
<A NAME="837"></A>in a few days, was to be a person of great power and authority. But the 
<A NAME="838"></A>youth having a greater inclination for Aufidius, disclosed all to him, 
<A NAME="839"></A>which much surprised and amazed him. For he was also one of the confederacy, 
<A NAME="840"></A>but knew not that Manlius was anyways engaged in it; but when the youth 
<A NAME="841"></A>began to name Perpenna, Gracinus, and others, whom he new very well to 
<A NAME="842"></A>be sworn conspirators, he was very much terrified and astonished; but made 
<A NAME="843"></A>light of it to the youth, and bade him not regard what Manlius said, a 
<A NAME="844"></A>vain, boasting fellow. However, he went presently to Perpenna, and giving 
<A NAME="845"></A>him notice of the danger they were in, and of the shortness of their time, 
<A NAME="846"></A>desired him immediately to put their designs in execution. When all the 
<A NAME="847"></A>confederates had consented to it, they provided a messenger who brought 
<A NAME="848"></A>feigned letters to Sertorius, in which he had notice of a victory obtained, 
<A NAME="849"></A>it said, by one of his lieutenants, and of the great slaughter of his enemies: 
<A NAME="850"></A>and as Sertorius, being extremely well pleased, was sacrificing and giving 
<A NAME="851"></A>thanks to the gods for his prosperous success, Perpenna invited him, and 
<A NAME="852"></A>those with him, who were also of the conspiracy, to an entertainment, and 
<A NAME="853"></A>being very importunate, prevailed with him to come. At all suppers and 
<A NAME="854"></A>entertainments where Sertorius was present, great order and decency was 
<A NAME="855"></A>wont to be observed; for he would not endure to hear or see anything that 
<A NAME="856"></A>was rude or unhandsome, but made it the habit of all who kept his company 
<A NAME="857"></A>to entertain themselves with quiet and inoffensive amusements. But in the 
<A NAME="858"></A>middle of this entertainment, those who sought occasion to quarrel fell 
<A NAME="859"></A>into dissolute discourse openly, and making as if they were very drunk, 
<A NAME="860"></A>committed many insolences on purpose to provoke him. Sertorius, being offended 
<A NAME="861"></A>with their ill-behaviour, or perceiving the state of their minds by their 
<A NAME="862"></A>way of speaking and their unusually disrespectful manner changed the posture 
<A NAME="863"></A>of his lying, and leaned backward, as one that neither heard nor regarded 
<A NAME="864"></A>them. Perpenna now took a cup full of wine, and, as he was drinking, let 
<A NAME="865"></A>it fall out of his hand and made a noise, which was the sign agreed upon 
<A NAME="866"></A>amongst them; and Antonius, who was next to Sertorius, immediately wounded 
<A NAME="867"></A>him with his sword. And whilst Sertorius, upon receiving the wound, turned 
<A NAME="868"></A>himself, and strove to get up, Antonius threw himself upon his breast, 
<A NAME="869"></A>and held both his hands, so that he died by a number of blows, without 
<A NAME="870"></A>being able even to defend himself.
<A NAME="871"></A><BR><BR>Upon the first news of his death, most of the Spaniards left the 
<A NAME="872"></A>conspirators, and sent ambassadors to Pompey and Metellus, and yielded 
<A NAME="873"></A>themselves up to them. Perpenna attempted to do something with those that 
<A NAME="874"></A>remained, but he made only so much use of Sertorius's arms and preparations 
<A NAME="875"></A>for war as to disgrace himself in them, and to let it be evident to all 
<A NAME="876"></A>that he understood no more how to command than he knew how to obey; and 
<A NAME="877"></A>when he came against Pompey, he was soon overthrown and taken prisoner. 
<A NAME="878"></A>Neither did he bear this last affliction with any bravery, but having Sertorius's 
<A NAME="879"></A>papers and writings in his hands, he offered to show Pompey letters from 
<A NAME="880"></A>persons of consular dignity, and of the highest quality in Rome, written 
<A NAME="881"></A>with their own hands, expressly to call Sertorius into Italy, and to let 
<A NAME="882"></A>him know what great numbers there were that earnestly desired to alter 
<A NAME="883"></A>the present state of affairs, and to introduce another manner of government. 
<A NAME="884"></A>Upon this occasion, Pompey behaved not like a youth, or one of a light 
<A NAME="885"></A>inconsiderate mind, but as a man of a confirmed, mature, and solid judgment; 
<A NAME="886"></A>and so freed Rome from great fears and dangers of change. For he put all 
<A NAME="887"></A>Sertorius's writings and letters together and read not one of them, nor 
<A NAME="888"></A>suffered any one else to read them, but burnt them all, and caused Perpenna 
<A NAME="889"></A>immediately to be put to death, lest by discovering their names further 
<A NAME="890"></A>troubles and revolutions might ensue.
<A NAME="891"></A><BR><BR>Of the rest of the conspirators with Perpenna, some were taken 
<A NAME="892"></A>and slain by the command of Pompey, others fled into Africa, and were set 
<A NAME="893"></A>upon by the Moors, and run through with their darts: and in a short time 
<A NAME="894"></A>not one of them was left alive, except only Aufidius, the rival of Manlius, 
<A NAME="895"></A>who, hiding himself, or not being much inquired after, died an old man, 
<A NAME="896"></A>in an obscure village in Spain, in extreme poverty, and hated by 
<A NAME="897"></A>all.
