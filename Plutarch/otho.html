<BR>(legendary, died 69 A.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>The new emperor went early in the morning to the capitol, and sacrificed; 
<A NAME="11"></A>and, having commanded Marius Celsus to be brought, he saluted him, and 
<A NAME="12"></A>with obliging language desired him rather to forget his accusation than 
<A NAME="13"></A>remember his acquittal; to which Celsus answered neither meanly nor ungratefully, 
<A NAME="14"></A>that his very crime ought to recommend his integrity, since his guilt had 
<A NAME="15"></A>been his fidelity to Galba, from whom he had never received any personal 
<A NAME="16"></A>obligations. Upon which they were both of them admired by those that were 
<A NAME="17"></A>present, and applauded by the soldiers.
<A NAME="18"></A><BR><BR>In the senate, Otho said much in a gentle and popular strain. He 
<A NAME="19"></A>was to have been consul for part of that year himself, but he gave the 
<A NAME="20"></A>office to Virginius Rufus, and displaced none that had been named for the 
<A NAME="21"></A>consulship by either Nero or Galba. Those that were remarkable for their 
<A NAME="22"></A>age and dignity he promoted to the priesthoods; and restored the remains 
<A NAME="23"></A>of their fortunes, that had not yet been sold, to all those senators that 
<A NAME="24"></A>were banished by Nero, and recalled by Galba. So that the nobility and 
<A NAME="25"></A>chief of the people, who were at first apprenhensive that no human creature, 
<A NAME="26"></A>but some supernatural, or penal vindictive power had seized the empire, 
<A NAME="27"></A>began now to flatter themselves with hopes of a government that smiled 
<A NAME="28"></A>upon them thus early.
<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR>Besides, nothing gratified or gained the whole Roman people more 
<A NAME="30"></A>than his justice in relation to Tigellinus. It was not seen how he was 
<A NAME="31"></A>in fact already suffering punishment, not only by the very terror of retribution 
<A NAME="32"></A>which he saw the whole city requiring as a just debt, but with several 
<A NAME="33"></A>incurable diseases also; not to mention those unhallowed frightful excesses 
<A NAME="34"></A>among impure and prostitute women, to which, at the very close of life, 
<A NAME="35"></A>his lewd nature clung, and in them gasped out, as it were, its last; these, 
<A NAME="36"></A>in the opinion of all reasonable men, being themselves the extremest punishment, 
<A NAME="37"></A>and equal to many deaths. But it was felt like a grievance by people in 
<A NAME="38"></A>general that he continued yet to see the light of day, who had been the 
<A NAME="39"></A>occasion of the loss of it to so many persons, and such persons, as had 
<A NAME="40"></A>died by his means. Wherefore Otho ordered him to be sent for, just as he 
<A NAME="41"></A>was contriving his escape of means of some vessels that lay ready for him 
<A NAME="42"></A>on the coast near where he lived, in the neighbourhood of Sinuessa. At 
<A NAME="43"></A>first he endeavoured to corrupt the messenger, by a large sum of money, 
<A NAME="44"></A>to favour his design; but when he found this was to no purpose, he made 
<A NAME="45"></A>him as considerable a present as if he had really connived at it, only 
<A NAME="46"></A>entreating him to stay till he had shaved; and so took that opportunity, 
<A NAME="47"></A>and with his razor despatched himself.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>And while giving the people this most righteous satisfaction of 
<A NAME="49"></A>their desires, for himself he seemed to have no sort of regard for any 
<A NAME="50"></A>private injuries of his own. And at first, to please the populace, he did 
<A NAME="51"></A>not refuse to be called Nero in the theatre, and did not interfere when 
<A NAME="52"></A>some persons displayed Nero's statues to public view. And Cluvius Rufus 
<A NAME="53"></A>says, imperial letters, such as are sent with couriers, went into Spain 
<A NAME="54"></A>with the name of Nero affixed adoptively to that of Otho; but as soon he 
<A NAME="55"></A>perceived this gave offence to the chief and most distinguished citizens, 
<A NAME="56"></A>it was omitted.
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR>After he had begun to model the government in this manner, the 
<A NAME="58"></A>paid soldiers began to murmur, and endeavoured to make him suspect and 
<A NAME="59"></A>chastise the nobility, either really out of a concern for his safety, or 
<A NAME="60"></A>wishing, upon this pretence, to stir up trouble and warfare. Thus, whilst 
<A NAME="61"></A>Crispinus, whom he had ordered to bring him the seventeenth cohort from 
<A NAME="62"></A>Ostia, began to collect what he wanted after it was dark, and was putting 
<A NAME="63"></A>the arms upon the wagons, some of the most turbulent cried out that Crispinus 
<A NAME="64"></A>was disaffected, that the senate was practising something against the emperor, 
<A NAME="65"></A>and that those arms were to be employed against Caesar, and not for him. 
<A NAME="66"></A>When this report was once set afoot, it got the belief and excited the 
<A NAME="67"></A>passions of many; they broke out into violence; some seized the wagons, 
<A NAME="68"></A>and others slew Crispinus and two centurions that opposed them; and the 
<A NAME="69"></A>whole number of them, arraying themselves in their arms, and encouraging 
<A NAME="70"></A>one another to stand by Caesar, marched to Rome. And hearing there that 
<A NAME="71"></A>eighty of the senators were at supper with Otho, they flew into the palace, 
<A NAME="72"></A>and declared it was a fair opportunity to take off Caesar's enemies at 
<A NAME="73"></A>one stroke. A general alarm ensued of an immediate coming sack of the city. 
<A NAME="74"></A>All were in confusion about the palace, and Otho himself in no small consternation, 
<A NAME="75"></A>being not only concerned for the senators (some of whom had brought their 
<A NAME="76"></A>wives to supper thither), but also feeling himself to be an object of alarm 
<A NAME="77"></A>and suspicion to them, whose eyes he saw fixed on him in silence and terror. 
<A NAME="78"></A>Therefore he gave orders to the prefects to address the soldiers and do 
<A NAME="79"></A>their best to pacify them, while he bade the guests rise, and leave by 
<A NAME="80"></A>another door. They had only just made their way out, when the soldiers 
<A NAME="81"></A>rushed into the room, and called out, "Where are Caesar's enemies?" Then 
<A NAME="82"></A>Otho, standing up on his couch, made use both of arguments and entreaties, 
<A NAME="83"></A>and by actual tears at last, with great difficulty, persuaded them to desist. 
<A NAME="84"></A>The next day he went to the camp, and distributed a bounty of twelve hundred 
<A NAME="85"></A>and fifty drachmas a man amongst them; then commended them for the regard 
<A NAME="86"></A>and zeal they had for his safety, but told them that there were some who 
<A NAME="87"></A>were intriguing among them, who not only accused his own clemency, but 
<A NAME="88"></A>had also misrepresented their loyalty; and, therefore, he desired their 
<A NAME="89"></A>assistance in doing justice upon them. To which, when they all consented, 
<A NAME="90"></A>he was satisfied with the execution of two only, whose deaths he knew would 
<A NAME="91"></A>be regretted by no one man in the whole army.
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR>Such conduct, so little expected from him, was regarded by some 
<A NAME="93"></A>with gratitude and confidence; others looked upon his behaviour as a course 
<A NAME="94"></A>to which necessity drove him, to gain the people to the support of the 
<A NAME="95"></A>war. For now there were certain tidings that Vitellius had assumed the 
<A NAME="96"></A>sovereign title and authority, and frequent expresses brought accounts 
<A NAME="97"></A>of new accessions to him; others, however, came, announcing that the Pannonian, 
<A NAME="98"></A>Dalmatian, and Moesian legions, with their officers, adhered to Otho. Ere 
<A NAME="99"></A>long also came favourable letters from Mucianus and Vespasian, generals 
<A NAME="100"></A>of two formidable armies, the one in Syria, the other in Judaea, to assure 
<A NAME="101"></A>him of their firmness to his interest: in confidence whereof he was so 
<A NAME="102"></A>exalted, that he wrote to Vitellius not to attempt anything beyond his 
<A NAME="103"></A>post; and offered him large sums of money and a city, where he might live 
<A NAME="104"></A>his time out in pleasure and ease. These overtures at first were responded 
<A NAME="105"></A>to by Vitellius with equivocating civilities; which soon, however, turned 
<A NAME="106"></A>into an interchange of angry words; and letters passed between the two, 
<A NAME="107"></A>conveying bitter and shameful terms of reproach, which were not false indeed, 
<A NAME="108"></A>for that matter, only it was senseless and ridiculous for each to assail 
<A NAME="109"></A>the other with accusations to which both alike must plead guilty. For it 
<A NAME="110"></A>were hard to determine which of the two had been most profuse, most effeminate, 
<A NAME="111"></A>which was most a novice in military affairs, and most involved in debt 
<A NAME="112"></A>through previous want of means.
<A NAME="113"></A><BR><BR>As to the prodigies and apparitions that happened about this time, 
<A NAME="114"></A>there were many reported which none could answer for, or which were told 
<A NAME="115"></A>in different ways; but one which everybody actually saw with their eyes, 
<A NAME="116"></A>was the statue, in the capitol, of Victory carried in a chariot, with the 
<A NAME="117"></A>reins dropped out of her hands, as if she were grown too weak to hold them 
<A NAME="118"></A>any longer; and a second, that Caius Caesar's statue in the island of Tiber, 
<A NAME="119"></A>without any earthquake or wind to account for it, turned round from west 
<A NAME="120"></A>to east; and this, they say, happened about the time when Vespasian and 
<A NAME="121"></A>his party first openly began to put themselves forward. Another incident, 
<A NAME="122"></A>which the people in general thought an evil sign, was the inundation of 
<A NAME="123"></A>the Tiber; for though it happened at a time when rivers are usually at 
<A NAME="124"></A>their fullest, yet such height of water and so tremendous a flood had never 
<A NAME="125"></A>been known before, nor such a destruction of property, great part of the 
<A NAME="126"></A>city being under water, and especially the corn market, so that it occasioned 
<A NAME="127"></A>a great dearth for several days.
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR>But when news was now brought that Caecina and Valens, commanding 
<A NAME="129"></A>for Vitellius, had possessed themselves of the Alps, Otho sent Dolabella 
<A NAME="130"></A>(a patrician, who was suspected by the soldiery of some evil purpose), 
<A NAME="131"></A>for whatever reason, whether it were fear of him or of any one else, to 
<A NAME="132"></A>the town of Aquinum, to give encouragement there; and proceeding then to 
<A NAME="133"></A>choose which of the magistrates should go with him to the war, he named 
<A NAME="134"></A>amongst the rest Lucius, Vitellius's brother, without distinguishing him 
<A NAME="135"></A>by any new marks either of his favour or displeasure. He also took the 
<A NAME="136"></A>greatest precautions for Vitellius's wife and mother, that they might be 
<A NAME="137"></A>safe, and free from all apprehension for themselves. He made Flavius Sabinus, 
<A NAME="138"></A>Vespasian's brother, governor of Rome, either in honour to the memory of 
<A NAME="139"></A>Nero, who had advanced him formerly to that command, which Galba had taken 
<A NAME="140"></A>away, or else to show his confidence in Vespasian by his favour to his 
<A NAME="141"></A>brother.
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR>After he came to Brixillum, a town of Italy near the Po, he stayed 
<A NAME="143"></A>behind himself, and ordered the army to march under the conduct of Marius 
<A NAME="144"></A>Celsus, Suetonius Paulinus, Gallus, and Spurina, all men of experience 
<A NAME="145"></A>and reputation, but unable to carry their own plans and purposes into effect, 
<A NAME="146"></A>by reason of the ungovernable temper of the army, which would take orders 
<A NAME="147"></A>from none but the emperor whom they themselves had made their master. Nor 
<A NAME="148"></A>was the enemy under much better discipline, the soldiers there also being 
<A NAME="149"></A>haughty and disobedient upon the same account, but they were more experienced 
<A NAME="150"></A>and used to hard work; whereas Otho's men were soft from their long easy 
<A NAME="151"></A>living and lack of service, having spent most of their time in the theatres 
<A NAME="152"></A>and at state shows and on the stage; while moreover they tried to cover 
<A NAME="153"></A>their deficiencies by arrogance and vain display, pretending to decline 
<A NAME="154"></A>their duty, not because they were unable to do the thing commanded, but 
<A NAME="155"></A>because they thought themselves above it. So that Spurina had like to have 
<A NAME="156"></A>been cut in pieces for attempting to force them to their work; they assailed 
<A NAME="157"></A>him with insolent language, accusing him of a design to betray and ruin 
<A NAME="158"></A>Caesar's interest; nay, some of them that were in drink forced his tent 
<A NAME="159"></A>in the night, and demanded money for the expenses of their journey, which 
<A NAME="160"></A>they must at once take, they said, to the emperor, to complain of 
<A NAME="161"></A>him.
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR>However, the contemptuous treatment they met with at Placentia 
<A NAME="163"></A>did for the present good service to Spurina, and to the cause of Otho. 
<A NAME="164"></A>For Vitellius's men marched up to the walls, and upbraided Otho's upon 
<A NAME="165"></A>the ramparts, calling them players, dancers, idle spectators of Pythian 
<A NAME="166"></A>and Olympic games, but novices in the art of war, who never so much as 
<A NAME="167"></A>looked on at a battle; mean souls, that triumphed in the beheading of Galba, 
<A NAME="168"></A>an old man unarmed, but had no desire to look real enemies in the face. 
<A NAME="169"></A>Which reproaches so inflamed them that they kneeled at Spurina's feet, 
<A NAME="170"></A>entreated him to give his orders, and assured him no danger or toil should 
<A NAME="171"></A>be too great or too difficult for them. Whereupon when Vitellius's forces 
<A NAME="172"></A>made a vigorous attack on the town, and brought up numerous engines against 
<A NAME="173"></A>the walls, the besieged bravely repulsed them, and, repelling the enemy 
<A NAME="174"></A>with great slaughter, secured the safety of a noble city, one of the most 
<A NAME="175"></A>flourishing places in Italy.
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR>Besides, it was observed that Otho's officers were much more inoffensive, 
<A NAME="177"></A>both towards the public and to private men, than those of Vitellius; among 
<A NAME="178"></A>whom was Caecina, who used neither the language nor the apparel of a citizen, 
<A NAME="179"></A>an overbearing, foreign-seeming man, of gigantic stature, and always dressed 
<A NAME="180"></A>in trews and sleeves, after the manner of the Gauls, whilst he conversed 
<A NAME="181"></A>with Roman officials and magistrates. His wife, too, travelled along with 
<A NAME="182"></A>him, riding in splendid attire on horseback, with a chosen body of cavalry 
<A NAME="183"></A>to escort her. And Fabius Valens, the other general, was so rapacious that 
<A NAME="184"></A>neither what he plundered from enemies, nor what he stole or got as gifts 
<A NAME="185"></A>and bribes from his friends and allies, could satisfy his wishes. And it 
<A NAME="186"></A>was said that it was in order to have time to raise money that he had marched 
<A NAME="187"></A>so slowly that he was not present at the former attack. But some lay the 
<A NAME="188"></A>blame on Caecina, saying, that out of a desire to gain the victory by himself 
<A NAME="189"></A>before Fabius joined him, he committed sundry other errors of lesser consequence, 
<A NAME="190"></A>and by engaging unseasonably and when he could not do so thoroughly, he 
<A NAME="191"></A>very nearly brought all to ruin.
<A NAME="192"></A><BR><BR>When he found himself beat off at Placentia, he set off to attack 
<A NAME="193"></A>Cremona, another large and rich city. In the meantime, Annius Gallus marched 
<A NAME="194"></A>to join Spurina at Placentia; but having intelligence that the siege was 
<A NAME="195"></A>raised, and that Cremona was in danger, he turned to its relief, and encamped 
<A NAME="196"></A>just by the enemy, where he was daily reinforced by other officers. Caecina 
<A NAME="197"></A>placed a strong ambush of heavy infantry in some rough and woody country, 
<A NAME="198"></A>and gave orders to his horse to advance, and if the enemy should charge 
<A NAME="199"></A>them, then to make a slow retreat, and draw them into the snare. But his 
<A NAME="200"></A>stratagem was discovered by some deserters to Celsus, who attacked with 
<A NAME="201"></A>a good body of horse, but followed the pursuit cautiously, and succeeded 
<A NAME="202"></A>in surrounding and routing the troops in the ambuscade; and if the infantry 
<A NAME="203"></A>which he ordered up from the camp had come soon enough to sustain the horse, 
<A NAME="204"></A>Caecina's whole army, in all appearance, had been totally routed. But Paulinus, 
<A NAME="205"></A>moving too slowly, was accused of acting with a degree of needless caution 
<A NAME="206"></A>not to have been expected from one of his reputation. So that the soldiers 
<A NAME="207"></A>incensed Otho against him, accused him of treachery, and boasted loudly 
<A NAME="208"></A>that the victory had been in their power, and that if it was not complete, 
<A NAME="209"></A>it was owing to the mismanagement of their generals; all which Otho did 
<A NAME="210"></A>not so much believe as he was willing to appear not to disbelieve. He therefore 
<A NAME="211"></A>sent his brother Titianus, with Proculus, the prefect of the guards, to 
<A NAME="212"></A>the army, where the latter was general in reality, and the former in appearance. 
<A NAME="213"></A>Celsus and Paulinus had the title of friends and counsellors, but not the 
<A NAME="214"></A>least authority or power. At the same time, there was nothing but quarrel 
<A NAME="215"></A>and disturbance amongst the enemy, especially where Valens commanded; for 
<A NAME="216"></A>the soldiers here, being informed of what had happened at the ambuscade, 
<A NAME="217"></A>were enraged because they had not been permitted to be present to strike 
<A NAME="218"></A>a blow in defence of the lives of so many men that had died in that action; 
<A NAME="219"></A>Valens, with much difficulty, quieted their fury, after they had now begun 
<A NAME="220"></A>to throw missiles at him, and quitting his camp, joined 
<A NAME="221"></A>Caecina.
<A NAME="222"></A><BR><BR>About this time, Otho came to Bedriacum, a little town near Cremona, 
<A NAME="223"></A>to the camp, and called a council of war; where Proculus and Titianus declared 
<A NAME="224"></A>for giving battle, while the soldiers were flushed with their late success, 
<A NAME="225"></A>saying they ought not to lose their time and opportunity and present height 
<A NAME="226"></A>of strength, and wait for Vitellius to arrive out of Gaul. But Paulinus 
<A NAME="227"></A>told them that the enemy's whole force was present, and that there was 
<A NAME="228"></A>no body of reserve behind; but that Otho, if he would not be too precipitate, 
<A NAME="229"></A>and chose the enemy's time, instead of his own, for the battle, might expect 
<A NAME="230"></A>reinforcements out of Moesia and Pannonia, not inferior in numbers to the 
<A NAME="231"></A>troops that were already present. He thought it probable, too, that the 
<A NAME="232"></A>soldiers, who were then in heart before they were joined, would not be 
<A NAME="233"></A>less so when the forces were all come up. Besides, the deferring battle 
<A NAME="234"></A>could not be inconvenient to them that were sufficiently provided with 
<A NAME="235"></A>all necessaries; but the others, being in an enemy's country, must needs 
<A NAME="236"></A>be exceedingly straitened in a little time. Marius Celsus was of Paulinus's 
<A NAME="237"></A>opinion; Annius Gallus, being absent and under the surgeon's hands through 
<A NAME="238"></A>a fall from his horse, was consulted by letter, and advised Otho to stay 
<A NAME="239"></A>for those legions that were marching from Moesia. But after all he did 
<A NAME="240"></A>not follow the advice; and the opinion of those that declared for a battle 
<A NAME="241"></A>prevailed.
<A NAME="242"></A><BR><BR>There are several reasons given for this determination, but the 
<A NAME="243"></A>most apparent is this; that the praetorian soldiers, as they are called, 
<A NAME="244"></A>who serve as guards, not relishing the military discipline which they now 
<A NAME="245"></A>had begun a little more to experience, and longing for their amusements 
<A NAME="246"></A>and unwarlike life among the shows of Rome, would not be commanded, but 
<A NAME="247"></A>were eager for a battle, imagining that upon the first onset they should 
<A NAME="248"></A>carry all before them. Otho also himself seems not to have shown the proper 
<A NAME="249"></A>fortitude in bearing up against the uncertainty, and, out of effeminacy 
<A NAME="250"></A>and want of use, had not patience for the calculations of danger, and was 
<A NAME="251"></A>so uneasy at the apprehension of it that he shut his eyes, and like one 
<A NAME="252"></A>going to leap from a precipice, left everything to fortune. This is the 
<A NAME="253"></A>account Secundus the rhetorician, who was his secretary, gave of the matter. 
<A NAME="254"></A>But others would tell you that there were many movements in both armies 
<A NAME="255"></A>for acting in concert; and if it were possible for them to agree, then 
<A NAME="256"></A>they should proceed to choose one of their most experienced officers that 
<A NAME="257"></A>were present; if not, they should convene the senate, and invest it with 
<A NAME="258"></A>the power of election. And it is not improbable that, neither of the emperors 
<A NAME="259"></A>then bearing the title having really any reputation, such purposes were 
<A NAME="260"></A>really entertained among the genuine, serviceable, and sober-minded part 
<A NAME="261"></A>of the soldiers. For what could be more odious and unreasonable than that 
<A NAME="262"></A>the evils which the Roman citizens had formerly thought it so lamentable 
<A NAME="263"></A>to inflict upon each other for the sake of a Sylla or a Marius, a Caesar 
<A NAME="264"></A>or a Pompey, should now be undergone anew, for the object of letting the 
<A NAME="265"></A>empire pay the expenses of the gluttony and intemperance of Vitellius, 
<A NAME="266"></A>or the looseness and effeminacy of Otho? It is thought that Celsus, upon 
<A NAME="267"></A>such reflections, protracted the time in order to a possible accommodation; 
<A NAME="268"></A>and that Otho pushed on things to an extremity to prevent 
<A NAME="269"></A>it.
<A NAME="270"></A><BR><BR>He himself returned to Brixillum, which was another false step, 
<A NAME="271"></A>both because he withdrew from the combatants all the motives of respect 
<A NAME="272"></A>and desire to gain his favour which his presence would have supplied, and 
<A NAME="273"></A>because he weakened the army by detaching some of his best and most faithful 
<A NAME="274"></A>troops for his horse and foot guards.
<A NAME="275"></A><BR><BR>About the same time also happened a skirmish on the Po. As Caecina 
<A NAME="276"></A>was laying a bridge over it, Otho's men attacked him, and tried to prevent 
<A NAME="277"></A>it. And when they did not succeed, on their putting into their boats torchwood, 
<A NAME="278"></A>with a quantity of sulphur and pitch, the wind on the river suddenly caught 
<A NAME="279"></A>their material that they had prepared against the enemy, and blew it into 
<A NAME="280"></A>a light. First came smoke, and then a clear flame, and the men, getting 
<A NAME="281"></A>into great confusion and jumping overboard, upset the boats, and put themselves 
<A NAME="282"></A>ludicrously at the mercy of their enemies. Also the Germans attacked Otho's 
<A NAME="283"></A>gladiators upon a small island in the river, routed them, and killed a 
<A NAME="284"></A>good many.
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>All which made the soldiers at Bedriacum full of anger, and eagerness 
<A NAME="286"></A>to be led to battle. So Proculus led them out of Bedriacum to a place fifty 
<A NAME="287"></A>furlongs off, where he pitched his camp so ignorantly and with such a ridiculous 
<A NAME="288"></A>want of foresight that the soldiers suffered extremely for want of water, 
<A NAME="289"></A>though it was the spring time, and the plains all around were full of running 
<A NAME="290"></A>streams and rivers that never dried up. The next day he proposed to attack 
<A NAME="291"></A>the enemy, first making a march of not less than a hundred furlongs; but 
<A NAME="292"></A>to this Paulinus objected, saying they ought to wait, and not immediately 
<A NAME="293"></A>after a journey engage men who would have been standing in their arms and 
<A NAME="294"></A>arranging themselves for battle at their leisure, whilst they were making 
<A NAME="295"></A>a long march, with all their beasts of burden and their camp followers 
<A NAME="296"></A>to encumber them. As the generals were arguing about this matter, a Numidian 
<A NAME="297"></A>courier came from Otho with orders to lose no time, but give battle. Accordingly 
<A NAME="298"></A>they consented, and moved. As soon as Caecina had notice, he was much surprised, 
<A NAME="299"></A>and quitted his post on the river to hasten to the camp. In the meantime, 
<A NAME="300"></A>the men had armed themselves mostly, and were receiving the word from Valens; 
<A NAME="301"></A>so while the legions took up their position, they sent out the best of 
<A NAME="302"></A>their horse in advance.
<A NAME="303"></A><BR><BR>Otho's foremost troops, upon some groundless rumour, took up the 
<A NAME="304"></A>notion that the commanders on the other side would come over; and accordingly, 
<A NAME="305"></A>upon their first approach, they saluted them with the friendly title of 
<A NAME="306"></A>fellow-soldiers. But the others returned the compliment with anger and 
<A NAME="307"></A>disdainful words; which not only disheartened those that had given the 
<A NAME="308"></A>salutation, but excited suspicions of their fidelity amongst the others 
<A NAME="309"></A>on their side, who had not. This caused a confusion at the very first onset. 
<A NAME="310"></A>And nothing else that followed was done upon any plan; the baggage-carriers, 
<A NAME="311"></A>mingling up with the fighting men, created great disorder and division; 
<A NAME="312"></A>as well as the nature of the ground, the ditches and pits in which were 
<A NAME="313"></A>so many that they were forced to break their ranks to avoid and go round 
<A NAME="314"></A>them, and so to fight without order, and in small parties. There were but 
<A NAME="315"></A>two legions, one of Vitellius's called The Ravenous, and another of Otho's, 
<A NAME="316"></A>called The Assistant, that got out into the open outspread level and engaged 
<A NAME="317"></A>in proper form, fighting, one main body against the other, for some length 
<A NAME="318"></A>of time. Otho's men were strong and bold, but had never been in battle 
<A NAME="319"></A>before; Vitellius's had seen many wars, but were old and past their strength. 
<A NAME="320"></A>So Otho's legion charged boldly, drove back their opponents, and took the 
<A NAME="321"></A>eagle, killing pretty nearly every man in the first rank, till the others, 
<A NAME="322"></A>full of rage and shame, returned the charge, slew Orfidius, the commander 
<A NAME="323"></A>of the legion, and took several standards. Varus Alfenus, with his Batavians, 
<A NAME="324"></A>who are the natives of an island of the Rhine, and are esteemed the best 
<A NAME="325"></A>of the German horse, fell upon the gladiators, who had a reputation both 
<A NAME="326"></A>for valour and skill in fighting. Some few of these did their duty, but 
<A NAME="327"></A>the greatest part of them made towards the river, and, falling in with 
<A NAME="328"></A>some cohorts stationed there, were cut off. But none behaved so ill as 
<A NAME="329"></A>the praetorians, who, without ever so much as meeting the enemy, ran away, 
<A NAME="330"></A>broke through their own body that stood, and put them into disorder. Notwithstanding 
<A NAME="331"></A>this, many of Otho's men routed those that were opposed to them, broke 
<A NAME="332"></A>right into them, and forced their way to the camp through the very middle 
<A NAME="333"></A>of their conquerors.
<A NAME="334"></A><BR><BR>As for their commanders, neither Proculus nor Paulinus ventured 
<A NAME="335"></A>to reenter with the troops; they turned aside, and avoided the soldiers, 
<A NAME="336"></A>who had already charged the miscarriage upon their officers. Annius Gallus 
<A NAME="337"></A>received into the town and rallied the scattered parties, and encouraged 
<A NAME="338"></A>them with an assurance that the battle was a drawn one and the victory 
<A NAME="339"></A>had in many parts been theirs. Marius Celsus, collecting the officers, 
<A NAME="340"></A>urged the public interest; Otho himself, if he were a brave man, would 
<A NAME="341"></A>not, after such an expense of Roman blood, attempt anything further; especially 
<A NAME="342"></A>since even Cato and Scipio, though the liberty of Rome was then at stake, 
<A NAME="343"></A>had been accused of being too prodigal of so many brave men's lives as 
<A NAME="344"></A>were lost in Africa, rather than submit to Caesar after the battle of Pharsalia 
<A NAME="345"></A>had gone against them. For though all persons are equally subject to the 
<A NAME="346"></A>caprice of fortune, yet all good men have one advantage she cannot deny, 
<A NAME="347"></A>which is this, to act reasonably under misfortunes.
<A NAME="348"></A><BR><BR>This language was well accepted amongst the officers, who sounded 
<A NAME="349"></A>the private soldiers, and found them desirous of peace; and Titianus also 
<A NAME="350"></A>gave directions that envoys should be sent in order to a treaty. And accordingly 
<A NAME="351"></A>it was agreed that the conference should be between Celsus and Gallus on 
<A NAME="352"></A>one part, and Valens with Caecina on the other. As the two first were upon 
<A NAME="353"></A>their journey, they met some centurions, who told them the troops were 
<A NAME="354"></A>already in motion, marching for Bedriacum, but that they themselves were 
<A NAME="355"></A>deputed by their generals to carry proposals for an accommodation. Celsus 
<A NAME="356"></A>and Gallus expressed their approval, and requested them to turn back and 
<A NAME="357"></A>carry them to Caecina. However, Celsus, upon his approach, was in danger 
<A NAME="358"></A>from the vanguard, who happened to be some of the horse that had suffered 
<A NAME="359"></A>at the ambush. For as soon as they saw him, they hallooed, and were coming 
<A NAME="360"></A>down upon him; but the centurions came forward to protect him, and the 
<A NAME="361"></A>other officers crying out and bidding them desist, Caecina came up to inform 
<A NAME="362"></A>himself of the tumult, which he quieted, and giving a friendly greeting 
<A NAME="363"></A>to Celsus, took him in his company and proceeded towards Bedriacum. Titianus, 
<A NAME="364"></A>meantime, had repented of having sent the messengers; and placed those 
<A NAME="365"></A>of the soldiers who were more confident upon the walls once again, bidding 
<A NAME="366"></A>the others also go and support them. But when Caecina rode up on his horse 
<A NAME="367"></A>and held out his hand, no one did or said to the contrary; those on the 
<A NAME="368"></A>walls greeted his men with salutations, others opened the gates and went 
<A NAME="369"></A>out, and mingled freely with those they met; and instead of acts of hostility, 
<A NAME="370"></A>there was nothing but mutual shaking of hands and congratulations, every 
<A NAME="371"></A>one taking the oaths and submitting to Vitellius.
<A NAME="372"></A><BR><BR>This is the account which the most of those that were present at 
<A NAME="373"></A>the battle give of it, yet own that the disorder they were in, and the 
<A NAME="374"></A>absence of any unity of action, would not give them leave to be certain 
<A NAME="375"></A>as to particulars. And when I myself travelled afterwards over the field 
<A NAME="376"></A>of battle, Mestrius Florus, a man of consular degree, one of those who 
<A NAME="377"></A>had been, not willingly, but by command, in attendance on Otho at the time, 
<A NAME="378"></A>pointed out to me an ancient temple, and told me, that as he went that 
<A NAME="379"></A>way after the battle, he observed a heap of bodies piled up there to such 
<A NAME="380"></A>a height that those on the top of it reached the pinnacles of the roof. 
<A NAME="381"></A>How it came to be so, he could neither discover himself nor learn from 
<A NAME="382"></A>any other person; as indeed, he said, in civil wars it generally happens 
<A NAME="383"></A>that greater numbers are killed when an army is routed, quarter not being 
<A NAME="384"></A>given, because captives are of no advantage to the conquerors; but why 
<A NAME="385"></A>the carcasses should be heaped up after that manner is not easy to 
<A NAME="386"></A>determine.
<A NAME="387"></A><BR><BR>Otho, at first, as it frequently happens, received some uncertain 
<A NAME="388"></A>rumours of the issue of the battle. But when some of the wounded that returned 
<A NAME="389"></A>from the field informed him rightly of it, it is not, indeed, so much to 
<A NAME="390"></A>be wondered at that his friends should bid him not give all up as lost 
<A NAME="391"></A>or let his courage sink; but the feeling shown by the soldiers is something 
<A NAME="392"></A>that exceeds all belief. There was not one of them would either go over 
<A NAME="393"></A>to the conqueror or show any disposition to make terms for himself, as 
<A NAME="394"></A>if their leader's cause was desperate; on the contrary, they crowded his 
<A NAME="395"></A>gates, called out to him the title of emperor, and as soon as he appeared, 
<A NAME="396"></A>cried out and entreated him, catching hold of his band, and throwing themselves 
<A NAME="397"></A>upon the ground, and with all the moving language of tears and persuasion, 
<A NAME="398"></A>besought him to stand by them, not abandon them to their enemies, but employ 
<A NAME="399"></A>in his service their lives and persons, which would not cease to be his 
<A NAME="400"></A>so long as they had breath; so urgent was their zealous and universal importunity. 
<A NAME="401"></A>And one obscure and private soldier, after he had drawn his sword, addressed 
<A NAME="402"></A>himself to Otho: "By this, Caesar, judge our fidelity; there is not a man 
<A NAME="403"></A>amongst us but would strike thus to serve you;" and so stabbed himself. 
<A NAME="404"></A>Notwithstanding this, Otho stood serene and unshaken, and, with a face 
<A NAME="405"></A>full of constancy and composure, turned himself about and looked at them, 
<A NAME="406"></A>replying thus: "This day, my fellow-soldiers, which gives me such proofs 
<A NAME="407"></A>of your affection, is preferable even to that on which you saluted me emperor; 
<A NAME="408"></A>deny me not, therefore, the yet higher satisfaction of laying down my life 
<A NAME="409"></A>for the preservation of so many brave men; in this, at least, let me be 
<A NAME="410"></A>worthy of the empire, that is, to die for it. I am of opinion the enemy 
<A NAME="411"></A>has neither gained an entire nor a. decisive victory; I have advice that 
<A NAME="412"></A>the Moesian army is not many days' journey distant, on its march to the 
<A NAME="413"></A>Adriatic; Asia, Syria, and Egypt, and the legions that are serving against 
<A NAME="414"></A>the Jews, declare for us; the senate is also with us, and the wives and 
<A NAME="415"></A>children of our opponents are in our power; but alas, it is not in defence 
<A NAME="416"></A>of Italy against Hannibal or Pyrrhus or the Cimbri that we fight; Romans 
<A NAME="417"></A>combining against Romans, and, whether we conquer or are defeated, the 
<A NAME="418"></A>country suffers and we commit a crime: victory, to whichever it fall, is 
<A NAME="419"></A>gained at her expense. Believe it many times over, I can die with more 
<A NAME="420"></A>honour than I can reign. For I cannot see at all how I should do any such 
<A NAME="421"></A>great good to my country by gaining the victory, as I shall by dying to 
<A NAME="422"></A>establish peace and unanimity and to save Italy from such another unhappy 
<A NAME="423"></A>day."
<A NAME="424"></A><BR><BR>As soon as he had done, he was resolute against all manner of argument 
<A NAME="425"></A>or persuasion, and taking leave of his friends and the senators that were 
<A NAME="426"></A>present, he bade them depart, and wrote to those that were absent, and 
<A NAME="427"></A>sent letters to the towns, that they might have every honour and facility 
<A NAME="428"></A>in their journey. Then he sent for Cocceius, his brother's son, who was 
<A NAME="429"></A>yet a boy, and bade him be in no apprehension of Vitellius, whose mother 
<A NAME="430"></A>and wife and family he had treated with the same tenderness as his own; 
<A NAME="431"></A>and also told him that this had been his reason for delaying to adopt him, 
<A NAME="432"></A>which he had meant to do as his son; he had desired that he might share 
<A NAME="433"></A>his power, if he conquered, but not be involved in his ruin if he failed. 
<A NAME="434"></A>"Take notice," he added, "my boy, of these my last words, that you neither 
<A NAME="435"></A>too negligently forget, nor too zealously remember, that Caesar was your 
<A NAME="436"></A>uncle." By and by he heard a tumult amongst the soldiers at the door, who 
<A NAME="437"></A>were treating the senators with menaces for preparing to withdraw; upon 
<A NAME="438"></A>which, out of regard to their safety, he showed himself once more in public, 
<A NAME="439"></A>but not with a gentle aspect and in a persuading manner as before; on the 
<A NAME="440"></A>contrary, with a countenance that discovered indignation and authority, 
<A NAME="441"></A>he commanded such as were disorderly to leave the place, and was not 
<A NAME="442"></A>disobeyed.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR><BR>It was now evening, and feeling thirsty, he drank some water, and 
<A NAME="444"></A>then took two daggers that belonged to him, and when he had carefully examined 
<A NAME="445"></A>their edges, he laid one of them down, and put the other in his robe, under 
<A NAME="446"></A>his arm, then called his servants, and distributed some money amongst them, 
<A NAME="447"></A>but not inconsiderately, nor like one too lavish of what was not his own; 
<A NAME="448"></A>for to some he gave more, to others less, all strictly in moderation, and 
<A NAME="449"></A>distinguishing every one's particular merit. When this was done, he dismissed 
<A NAME="450"></A>them, and passed the rest of the night in so sound a sleep that the officers 
<A NAME="451"></A>of his bed-chamber heard him snore. In the morning, he called for one of 
<A NAME="452"></A>his freedmen, who had assisted him in arranging about the senators, and 
<A NAME="453"></A>bade him bring him an account if they were safe. Being informed they were 
<A NAME="454"></A>all well and wanted nothing, "Go then," he said "and show yourself to the 
<A NAME="455"></A>soldiers, lest they should cut you to pieces for being accessory to my 
<A NAME="456"></A>death." As soon as he was gone, he held his sword upright under him with 
<A NAME="457"></A>both his hands, and falling upon it expired with no more than one single 
<A NAME="458"></A>groan to express his sense of the pang, or to inform those that waited 
<A NAME="459"></A>without. When his servants, therefore, raised their exclamations of grief, 
<A NAME="460"></A>the whole camp and city were at once filled with lamentation; the soldiers 
<A NAME="461"></A>immediately broke in at the doors with a loud cry, in passionate distress, 
<A NAME="462"></A>and accusing themselves that they had been so negligent in looking after 
<A NAME="463"></A>that life which was laid down to preserve theirs. Nor would a man of them 
<A NAME="464"></A>quit the body to secure his own safety with the approaching enemy; but 
<A NAME="465"></A>having raised a funeral pile, and attired the body, they bore it thither, 
<A NAME="466"></A>arrayed in their arms, those among them greatly exulting who succeeded 
<A NAME="467"></A>in getting first under the bier and becoming its bearers. Of the others, 
<A NAME="468"></A>some threw themselves down before the body and kissed his wound, others 
<A NAME="469"></A>grasped his hand, and others that were at a distance knelt down to do him 
<A NAME="470"></A>obeisance. There were some who, after putting their torches to the pile, 
<A NAME="471"></A>slew themselves, though they had not, so far as appeared, either any particular 
<A NAME="472"></A>obligations to the dead, or reason to apprehend ill-usage from the victor. 
<A NAME="473"></A>Simply, it would seem, no king, legal or illegal, had ever been possessed 
<A NAME="474"></A>with so extreme and vehement a passion to command others, as was that of 
<A NAME="475"></A>these men to obey Otho. Nor did their love of him cease with his death; 
<A NAME="476"></A>it survived and changed ere long into a mortal hatred to his successor, 
<A NAME="477"></A>as will be shown in its proper place.
<A NAME="478"></A><BR><BR>They placed the remains of Otho in the earth and raised over them 
<A NAME="479"></A>a monument which neither by its size nor the pomp of its inscription might 
<A NAME="480"></A>excite hostility. I myself have seen it, at Brixillum; a plain structure, 
<A NAME="481"></A>and the epitaph only this: To the memory of Marcus Otho. He died in his 
<A NAME="482"></A>thirty-eighth year, after a short reign of about three months, his death 
<A NAME="483"></A>being as much applauded as his life was censured, for if he lived no better 
<A NAME="484"></A>than Nero, he died more nobly. The soldiers were displeased with Pollio, 
<A NAME="485"></A>one of their two prefects, who bade them immediately swear allegiance to 
<A NAME="486"></A>Vitellius; and when they understood that some of the senators were still 
<A NAME="487"></A>upon the spot, they made no opposition to the departure of the rest, but 
<A NAME="488"></A>only disturbed the tranquillity of Virginius Rufus with an offer of the 
<A NAME="489"></A>government, and moving in one body to his house in town they first entreated 
<A NAME="490"></A>him, and then demanded of him to be head of the empire, or at least to 
<A NAME="491"></A>be their mediator. But he, that refused to command them when conquerors, 
<A NAME="492"></A>thought it ridiculous to pretend to it now they were beat, and was unwilling 
<A NAME="493"></A>to go as their envoy to the Germans, whom in past time he had compelled 
<A NAME="494"></A>to do various things that they had not liked; and for these reasons he 
<A NAME="495"></A>slipped away through a private door. As soon as the soldiers perceived 
<A NAME="496"></A>this, they owned Vitellius, and so got their pardon, and served under 
<A NAME="497"></A>Caecina.
