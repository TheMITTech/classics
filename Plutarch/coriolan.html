<BR>(legendary, lived legendary, 5th century B.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>The patrician house of the Marcii in Rome produced many men of distinction, 
<A NAME="11"></A>and among the rest, Ancus Marcius, grandson to Numa by his daughter, and 
<A NAME="12"></A>king after Tullus Hostilius; of the same family were also Publius and Quintus 
<A NAME="13"></A>Marcius, which two conveyed into the city the best and most abundant supply 
<A NAME="14"></A>of water they have at Rome. As likewise Censorinus, who, having been twice 
<A NAME="15"></A>chosen censor by the people, afterwards himself induced them to make a 
<A NAME="16"></A>law that nobody should bear that office twice. But Caius Marcius, of whom 
<A NAME="17"></A>I now write, being left an orphan, and brought up under the widowhood of 
<A NAME="18"></A>his mother, has shown us by experience, that, although the early loss of 
<A NAME="19"></A>a father may be attended with other disadvantages, yet it can hinder none 
<A NAME="20"></A>from being either virtuous or eminent in the world, and that it is no obstacle 
<A NAME="21"></A>to true goodness and excellence; however bad men may be pleased to lay 
<A NAME="22"></A>the blame of their corruptions upon that misfortune and the neglect of 
<A NAME="23"></A>them in their minority. Nor is he less an evidence to the truth of their 
<A NAME="24"></A>opinion who conceive that a generous and worthy nature without proper discipline, 
<A NAME="25"></A>like a rich soil without culture, is apt with its better fruits to produce 
<A NAME="26"></A>also much that is bad and faulty. While the force and vigour of his soul, 
<A NAME="27"></A>and a persevering constancy in all he undertook, led him successfully into 
<A NAME="28"></A>many noble achievements, yet, on the other side, also, by indulging the 
<A NAME="29"></A>vehemence of his passion, and through an obstinate reluctance to yield 
<A NAME="30"></A>or accommodate his humours and sentiments to those of a people about him, 
<A NAME="31"></A>he rendered himself incapable of acting and associating with others. Those 
<A NAME="32"></A>who saw with admiration how proof his nature was against all the softnesses 
<A NAME="33"></A>of pleasure, the hardships of service, and the allurements of gain, while 
<A NAME="34"></A>allowing to that universal firmness of his the respective names of temperance, 
<A NAME="35"></A>fortitude, and justice, yet in the life of the citizen and the statesman, 
<A NAME="36"></A>could not choose but be disgusted at the severity and ruggedness of his 
<A NAME="37"></A>deportment, and with his overbearing, haughty, and imperious temper. Education 
<A NAME="38"></A>and study, and the favours of the muses, confer no greater benefit on those 
<A NAME="39"></A>that seek them than these humanizing and civilizing lessons, which teach 
<A NAME="40"></A>our natural qualities to submit to the limitations prescribed by reason, 
<A NAME="41"></A>and to avoid the wildness of extremes.
<A NAME="42"></A><BR><BR>Those were times at Rome in which that kind of worth was most esteemed 
<A NAME="43"></A>which displayed itself in military achievements; one evidence of which 
<A NAME="44"></A>we find in the Latin word for virtue, which is properly equivalent to manly 
<A NAME="45"></A>courage. As if valour and all virtue had been the same thing, they used 
<A NAME="46"></A>as the common term the name of the particular excellence. But Marcius, 
<A NAME="47"></A>having a more passionate inclination than any of that age for feats of 
<A NAME="48"></A>war, began at once, from his very childhood, to handle arms; and feeling 
<A NAME="49"></A>that adventitious implements and artificial arms would effect little, and 
<A NAME="50"></A>be of small use to such as have not their native and natural weapons well 
<A NAME="51"></A>fixed and prepared for service, he so exercised and inured his body to 
<A NAME="52"></A>all sorts of activity and encounter, that besides the lightness of a racer, 
<A NAME="53"></A>he had a weight in close seizures and wrestlings with an enemy, from which 
<A NAME="54"></A>it was hard for any to disengage himself; so that his competitors at home 
<A NAME="55"></A>in displays of bravery, loth to own themselves inferior in that respect, 
<A NAME="56"></A>were wont to ascribe their deficiencies to his strength of body, which 
<A NAME="57"></A>they say no resistance and no fatigue could exhaust.
<A NAME="58"></A><BR><BR>The first time he went out to the wars, being yet a stripling, 
<A NAME="59"></A>was when Tarquinius Superbus, who had been King of Rome and was afterwards 
<A NAME="60"></A>expelled, after many unsuccessful attempts, now entered upon his last effort, 
<A NAME="61"></A>and proceeded to hazard all as it were upon a single throw. A great number 
<A NAME="62"></A>of the Latins and other people of Italy joined their forces, and were marching 
<A NAME="63"></A>with him toward the city, to procure his restoration; not, however, so 
<A NAME="64"></A>much out of a desire to serve and oblige Tarquin, as to gratify their own 
<A NAME="65"></A>fear and envy at the increase of the Roman greatness; which they were anxious 
<A NAME="66"></A>to check and reduce. The armies met and engaged in a decisive battle, in 
<A NAME="67"></A>the vicissitudes of which Marcius, while fighting bravely in the dictator's 
<A NAME="68"></A>presence, saw a Roman soldier struck down at a little distance, and immediately 
<A NAME="69"></A>stepped in and stood before him, and slew his assailant. The general, after 
<A NAME="70"></A>having gained the victory, crowned him for this act, one of the first, 
<A NAME="71"></A>with a garland of oaken branches; it being the Roman custom thus to adorn 
<A NAME="72"></A>those who had saved the life of a citizen; whether that the law intended 
<A NAME="73"></A>some special honour to the oak, in memory of the Arcadians, a people the 
<A NAME="74"></A>oracle had made famous by the name of acorn-eaters; or whether the reason 
<A NAME="75"></A>of it was because they might easily, and in all places where they fought, 
<A NAME="76"></A>have plenty of oak for that purpose; or, finally, whether the oaken wreath, 
<A NAME="77"></A>being sacred to Jupiter, the guardian of the city, might, therefore, be 
<A NAME="78"></A>thought a proper ornament for one who preserved a citizen. And the oak, 
<A NAME="79"></A>in truth, is the tree which bears the most and the prettiest fruit of any 
<A NAME="80"></A>that grow wild, and is the strongest of all that are under cultivation; 
<A NAME="81"></A>its acorns were the principal diet of the first mortals, and the honey 
<A NAME="82"></A>found in it gave them drink. I may say, too, it furnished fowl and other 
<A NAME="83"></A>creatures as dainties, in producing mistletoe for bird-lime to ensnare 
<A NAME="84"></A>them. In this battle, meantime, it is stated that Castor and Pollux appeared, 
<A NAME="85"></A>and immediately after the battle were seen at Rome just by the fountain 
<A NAME="86"></A>where their temple now stands, with their horses foaming with sweat, and 
<A NAME="87"></A>told the news of the victory to the people in the forum. The fifteenth 
<A NAME="88"></A>of July, being the day of this conquest, became consequently a solemn holiday 
<A NAME="89"></A>sacred to the Twin Brothers.
<A NAME="90"></A><BR><BR>It may be observed, in general, that when young men arrive early 
<A NAME="91"></A>at fame and repute, if they are of a nature but slightly touched with emulation, 
<A NAME="92"></A>this early attainment is apt to extinguish their thirst and satiate their 
<A NAME="93"></A>appetite; whereas the first distinctions of more and solid and weighty 
<A NAME="94"></A>characters do but stimulate and quicken them and take them away like a 
<A NAME="95"></A>wind in the pursuit of honour; they look upon these marks and testimonies 
<A NAME="96"></A>to their virtue not as a recompense received for what they have already 
<A NAME="97"></A>done, but as a pledge given by themselves of what they will perform hereafter, 
<A NAME="98"></A>ashamed now to forsake or underlive the credit they have won, or, rather, 
<A NAME="99"></A>not to exceed and obscure all that is gone before by the lustre of their 
<A NAME="100"></A>following actions. Marcius, having a spirit of this noble make, was ambitious 
<A NAME="101"></A>always to surpass himself, and did nothing how extraordinary soever, but 
<A NAME="102"></A>he thought he was bound to outdo it at the next occasion; and ever desiring 
<A NAME="103"></A>to give continual fresh instances of prowess, he added one exploit to another, 
<A NAME="104"></A>and heaped up trophies upon trophies, so as to make it matter of contest 
<A NAME="105"></A>also among his commanders, the latter still vying with the earlier, which 
<A NAME="106"></A>should pay him the greatest honour and speak highest in his commendation. 
<A NAME="107"></A>Of all the numerous wars and conflicts in those days there was not one 
<A NAME="108"></A>from which he returned without laurels and rewards. And, whereas others 
<A NAME="109"></A>made glory the end of their daring, the end of his glory was his mother's 
<A NAME="110"></A>gladness; the delight she took to hear him praised and to see him crowned, 
<A NAME="111"></A>and her weeping for joy in his embraces rendered him in his own thoughts 
<A NAME="112"></A>the most honoured and most happy person in the world. Epaminondas is similarly 
<A NAME="113"></A>said to have acknowledged his feeling, that it was the greatest felicity 
<A NAME="114"></A>of his whole life that his father and mother survived to hear of his successful 
<A NAME="115"></A>generalship and his victory of Leuctra. And he had the advantage, indeed, 
<A NAME="116"></A>to have both his parents partake with him, and enjoy the pleasure of his 
<A NAME="117"></A>good fortune. But Marcius, believing himself bound to pay his mother Volumnia 
<A NAME="118"></A>all that gratitude and duty which would have belonged to his father, had 
<A NAME="119"></A>he also been alive, could never satiate himself in his tenderness and respect 
<A NAME="120"></A>to her. He took a wife, also, at her request and wish, and continued, even 
<A NAME="121"></A>after he had children, to live still with his mother, without parting 
<A NAME="122"></A>families.
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>The repute of his integrity and courage had, by this time, gained 
<A NAME="124"></A>him a considerable influence and authority in Rome, when the senate, favouring 
<A NAME="125"></A>the wealthier citizens, began to be at variance with the common people, 
<A NAME="126"></A>who made sad complaints of the rigorous and inhuman usage they received 
<A NAME="127"></A>from the money-lenders. For as many as were behind with them, and had any 
<A NAME="128"></A>sort of property, they stripped of all they had, by the way of pledges 
<A NAME="129"></A>and sales; and such as through former exactions were reduced already to 
<A NAME="130"></A>extreme indigence, and had nothing more to be deprived of, these they led 
<A NAME="131"></A>away in person and put their bodies under constraint, notwithstanding the 
<A NAME="132"></A>scars and wounds that they could show in attestation of their public services 
<A NAME="133"></A>in numerous campaigns; the last of which had been against the Sabines, 
<A NAME="134"></A>which they undertook upon a promise made by their rich creditors that they 
<A NAME="135"></A>would treat them with more gentleness for the future, Marcus Valerius, 
<A NAME="136"></A>the consul, having, by order from the senate, engaged also for the performance 
<A NAME="137"></A>of it. But when, after they had fought courageously and beaten the enemy, 
<A NAME="138"></A>there was, nevertheless, no moderation or forbearance used, and the senate 
<A NAME="139"></A>also professed to remember nothing of that agreement, and sat without testifying 
<A NAME="140"></A>the least concern to see them dragged away like slaves and their goods 
<A NAME="141"></A>seized upon as formerly, there began now to be open disorders and dangerous 
<A NAME="142"></A>meetings in the city; and the enemy, also, aware of the popular confusion, 
<A NAME="143"></A>invaded and laid waste the country. And when the consuls now gave notice, 
<A NAME="144"></A>that all who were of an age to bear arms should make their personal appearance, 
<A NAME="145"></A>but found no one regard the summons, the members of the government, then 
<A NAME="146"></A>coming to consult what course should be taken, were themselves again divided 
<A NAME="147"></A>in opinion; some thought it most advisable to comply a little in favour 
<A NAME="148"></A>of the poor, by relaxing their overstrained rights, and mitigating the 
<A NAME="149"></A>extreme rigour of the law, while others withstood this proposal; Marcius 
<A NAME="150"></A>in particular, with more vehemence than the rest, alleging that the business 
<A NAME="151"></A>of money on either side was not the main thing in question, urged that 
<A NAME="152"></A>this disorderly proceeding was but the first insolent step towards open 
<A NAME="153"></A>revolt against the laws, which it would become the wisdom of the government 
<A NAME="154"></A>to check at the earliest moment.
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR>There had been frequent assemblies of the whole senate, within 
<A NAME="156"></A>a small compass of time, about this difficulty, but without any certain 
<A NAME="157"></A>issue; the poor commonalty, therefore, perceiving there was likely to be 
<A NAME="158"></A>no redress of their grievances, on a sudden collected in a body, and, encouraging 
<A NAME="159"></A>each other in their resolution, forsook the city, with one accord, and 
<A NAME="160"></A>seizing the hill which is now called the Holy Mount, sat down by the river 
<A NAME="161"></A>Anio, without committing any sort of violence or seditious outrage, but 
<A NAME="162"></A>merely exclaiming, as they went along, that they had this long time past 
<A NAME="163"></A>been, in fact, expelled and excluded from the city by the cruelty of the 
<A NAME="164"></A>rich; that Italy would everywhere afford them the benefit of air and water 
<A NAME="165"></A>and a place of burial, which was all they could expect in the city, unless 
<A NAME="166"></A>it were, perhaps, the privilege of being wounded and killed in time of 
<A NAME="167"></A>war for the defence of their creditors. The senate, apprehending the consequences, 
<A NAME="168"></A>sent the most moderate and popular men of their own order to treat with 
<A NAME="169"></A>them.
<A NAME="170"></A><BR><BR>Menenius Agrippa, their chief spokesman, after much entreaty to 
<A NAME="171"></A>the people, and much plain-speaking on behalf of the senate, concluded, 
<A NAME="172"></A>at length, with the celebrated fable. "It once happened," he said, "that 
<A NAME="173"></A>all the other members of a man mutinied against the stomach, which they 
<A NAME="174"></A>accused as the only idle, uncontributing part the whole body, while the 
<A NAME="175"></A>rest were put to hardships and the expense of much labour to supply and 
<A NAME="176"></A>minister to its appetites. The stomach, however, merely ridiculed the silliness 
<A NAME="177"></A>of the members, who appeared not to be aware that the stomach certainly 
<A NAME="178"></A>does receive the general nourishment, but only to return it again, and 
<A NAME="179"></A>redistribute it amongst the rest. Such is the case," he said, "ye citizens, 
<A NAME="180"></A>between you and the senate. The counsels and plans that are there duly 
<A NAME="181"></A>digested, convey and secure to all of you your proper benefit and 
<A NAME="182"></A>support."
<A NAME="183"></A><BR><BR>A reconciliation ensued, the senate acceding to the request of 
<A NAME="184"></A>the people for the annual election of five protectors for those in need 
<A NAME="185"></A>of succour, the same that are now called the tribunes of the people; and 
<A NAME="186"></A>the first two they pitched upon were Junius Brutus and Sicinnius Vellutus, 
<A NAME="187"></A>their leaders in the secession.
<A NAME="188"></A><BR><BR>The city being thus united, the commons stood presently to their 
<A NAME="189"></A>arms, and followed their commanders to the war with great alacrity. As 
<A NAME="190"></A>for Marcius, though he was not a little vexed himself to see the populace 
<A NAME="191"></A>prevail so far, and gain ground of the senators, and might observe many 
<A NAME="192"></A>other patricians have the same dislike of the late concessions, he yet 
<A NAME="193"></A>besought them not to yield at least to the common people in the zeal and 
<A NAME="194"></A>forwardness they now showed for their country's service, but to prove that 
<A NAME="195"></A>they were superior to them, not so much in power and riches, as in merit 
<A NAME="196"></A>and worth.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>The Romans were now at war with the Volscian nation, whose principal 
<A NAME="198"></A>city was Corioli; when, therefore, Cominius the consul had invested this 
<A NAME="199"></A>important place, the rest of the Volscians, fearing it would be taken, 
<A NAME="200"></A>mustered up whatever force they could from all parts, to relieve it, designing 
<A NAME="201"></A>to give the Romans battle before the city, and so attack them on both sides. 
<A NAME="202"></A>Cominius, to avoid this inconvenience, divided his army, marching himself 
<A NAME="203"></A>with one body to encounter the Volscians on their approach from without 
<A NAME="204"></A>and leaving Titus Lartius, one of the bravest Romans of his time, to command 
<A NAME="205"></A>the other and continue the siege. Those within Corioli, despising now the 
<A NAME="206"></A>smallness of their number, made a sally upon them, and prevailed at first, 
<A NAME="207"></A>and pursued the Romans into their trenches. Here it was that Marcius, flying 
<A NAME="208"></A>out with a slender company, and cutting those in pieces that first engaged 
<A NAME="209"></A>him, obliged the other assailants to slacken their speed; and then, with 
<A NAME="210"></A>loud cries, called upon the Romans to renew the battle. For he had, what 
<A NAME="211"></A>Cato thought a great point in a soldier, not only strength of hand and 
<A NAME="212"></A>stroke, but also a voice and look that of themselves were a terror to an 
<A NAME="213"></A>enemy. Divers of his own party now rallying and making up to him, the enemies 
<A NAME="214"></A>soon retreated; but Marcius, not content to see them draw off and retire, 
<A NAME="215"></A>pressed hard upon the rear, and drove them, as they fled away in haste, 
<A NAME="216"></A>to the very gates of their city; where, perceiving the Romans to fall back 
<A NAME="217"></A>from their pursuit, beaten off by the multitude of darts poured in upon 
<A NAME="218"></A>them from the walls, and that none of his followers had the hardiness to 
<A NAME="219"></A>think of falling in pell-mell among the fugitives and so entering a city 
<A NAME="220"></A>full of enemies in arms, he, nevertheless, stood and urged them to the 
<A NAME="221"></A>attempt, crying out, that fortune had now set open Corioli, not so much 
<A NAME="222"></A>to shelter the vanquished, as to receive the conquerors. Seconded by a 
<A NAME="223"></A>few that were willing to venture with him, he bore along through the crowd, 
<A NAME="224"></A>made good his passage, and thrust himself into the gate through the midst 
<A NAME="225"></A>of them, nobody at first daring to resist him. But when the citizens on 
<A NAME="226"></A>looking about saw that a very small number had entered, they now took courage, 
<A NAME="227"></A>and came up and attacked them. A combat ensued of the most extraordinary 
<A NAME="228"></A>description, in which Marcius, by strength of hand, and swiftness of foot, 
<A NAME="229"></A>and daring of soul, overpowering every one that he assailed, succeeded 
<A NAME="230"></A>in driving the enemy to seek refuge, for the most part, in the interior 
<A NAME="231"></A>of the town, while those remaining submitted, and threw down their arms; 
<A NAME="232"></A>thus affording Lartius abundant opportunity to bring in the rest of the 
<A NAME="233"></A>Romans with ease and safety.
<A NAME="234"></A><BR><BR>Corioli being thus surprised and taken, the greater part of the 
<A NAME="235"></A>soldiers employed themselves in spoiling and pillaging it, while Marcius 
<A NAME="236"></A>indignantly reproached them, and exclaimed that it was a dishonourable 
<A NAME="237"></A>and unworthy thing, when the consul and their Fellow-citizens had now perhaps 
<A NAME="238"></A>encountered the other Volscians, and were hazarding their lives in battle, 
<A NAME="239"></A>basely to misspend the time in running up and down for booty, and, under 
<A NAME="240"></A>a pretence of enriching themselves, keep out of danger. Few paid him any 
<A NAME="241"></A>attention, but, putting himself at the head of these, he took the road 
<A NAME="242"></A>by which the consul's army had marched before him, encouraging his companions, 
<A NAME="243"></A>and beseeching them, as they went along, not to give up, and praying often 
<A NAME="244"></A>to the gods, too, that he might be so happy as to arrive before the fight 
<A NAME="245"></A>was over, and come seasonably up to assist Cominius, and partake in the 
<A NAME="246"></A>peril of the action.
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR>It was customary with the Romans of that age, when they were moving 
<A NAME="248"></A>into battle array, and were on the point of taking up their bucklers, and 
<A NAME="249"></A>girding their coats about them, to make at the same time an unwritten will, 
<A NAME="250"></A>or verbal testament, and to name who should be their heirs, in the hearing 
<A NAME="251"></A>of three or four witnesses. In this precise posture Marcius found them 
<A NAME="252"></A>at his arrival, the enemy being advanced within view.
<A NAME="253"></A><BR><BR>They were not a little disturbed by his first appearance, seeing 
<A NAME="254"></A>him covered with blood and sweat, and attended with a small train; but 
<A NAME="255"></A>when he hastily made up to the consul with gladness in his looks, giving 
<A NAME="256"></A>him his hand, and recounting to him how the city had been taken, and when 
<A NAME="257"></A>they saw Cominius also embrace and salute him, every one took fresh heart; 
<A NAME="258"></A>those that were near enough hearing, and those that were at a distance 
<A NAME="259"></A>guessing, what had happened; and all cried out to be led to battle. First, 
<A NAME="260"></A>however, Marcius desired to know of him how the Volscians had arrayed their 
<A NAME="261"></A>army and where they had placed their best men and on his answering that 
<A NAME="262"></A>he took the troops of the Antiates in the centre to be their prime warriors 
<A NAME="263"></A>that would yield to none in bravery, "Let me demand and obtain of you," 
<A NAME="264"></A>said Marcius, "that we may be posted against them." The consul granted 
<A NAME="265"></A>the request, with much admiration for his gallantry. And when the conflict 
<A NAME="266"></A>began by the soldiers darting at each other, and Marcius sallied out before 
<A NAME="267"></A>the rest the Volscians opposed to him were not able to make head against 
<A NAME="268"></A>him; wherever he fell in, he broke their ranks, and made a lane through 
<A NAME="269"></A>them; but the parties turning again, and enclosing him on each side with 
<A NAME="270"></A>their weapons, the consul, who observed the danger he was in despatched 
<A NAME="271"></A>some of the choicest men he had for his rescue. The conflict then growing 
<A NAME="272"></A>warm and sharp about Marcius and many falling dead in a little space, the 
<A NAME="273"></A>Romans bore so hard upon their enemies, and pressed them with such violence, 
<A NAME="274"></A>that they forced them at length to abandon their ground, and to quit the 
<A NAME="275"></A>field. And going now to prosecute the victory, they besought Marcius, tired 
<A NAME="276"></A>out with his toils, and faint and heavy through the loss of blood, that 
<A NAME="277"></A>he would retire to the camp. He replied, however, that weariness was not 
<A NAME="278"></A>for conquerors, and joined with them in the pursuit. The rest of the Volscian 
<A NAME="279"></A>army was in like manner defeated, great numbers killed, and no less taken 
<A NAME="280"></A>captive.
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR>The day after, when Marcius, with the rest of the army, presented 
<A NAME="282"></A>themselves at the consul's tent, Cominius rose, and having rendered all 
<A NAME="283"></A>due acknowledgment to the gods for the success of that enterprise, turned 
<A NAME="284"></A>next to Marcius, and first of all delivered the strongest encomium upon 
<A NAME="285"></A>his rare exploits, which he had partly been an eye-witness of himself, 
<A NAME="286"></A>in the late battle, and had partly learned from the testimony of Lartius. 
<A NAME="287"></A>And then he required him to choose a tenth part of all the treasure and 
<A NAME="288"></A>horses and captives that had fallen into their hands, before any division 
<A NAME="289"></A>should be made to others; besides which, he made him the special present 
<A NAME="290"></A>of a horse with trappings and ornaments, in honour of his actions. The 
<A NAME="291"></A>whole army applauded; Marcius, however, stepped forth, and declaring his 
<A NAME="292"></A>thankful acceptance of the horse, and his gratification at the praises 
<A NAME="293"></A>of his general, said, that all other things, which he could only regard 
<A NAME="294"></A>rather as mercenary advantages than any significations of honour, he must 
<A NAME="295"></A>waive, and should be content with the ordinary proportion of such rewards. 
<A NAME="296"></A>"I have only," said he, "one special grace to beg, and this I hope you 
<A NAME="297"></A>will not deny me. There was a certain hospitable friend of mine among the 
<A NAME="298"></A>Volscians, a man of probity and virtue, who is become a prisoner, and from 
<A NAME="299"></A>former wealth and freedom is now reduced to servitude. Among his many misfortunes 
<A NAME="300"></A>let my intercession redeem him from the one of being sold as a common slave." 
<A NAME="301"></A>Such a refusal and such a request on the part of Marcius were followed 
<A NAME="302"></A>with yet louder acclamations; and he had many more admirers of this generous 
<A NAME="303"></A>superiority to avarice, than of the bravery he had shown in battle. The 
<A NAME="304"></A>very persons who conceived some envy and despite to see him so specially 
<A NAME="305"></A>honoured, could not but acknowledge, that one who so nobly could refuse 
<A NAME="306"></A>reward, was beyond others worthy to receive it; and were more charmed with 
<A NAME="307"></A>that virtue which made him despise advantage, than with any of those former 
<A NAME="308"></A>actions that have gained him his title to it. It is the higher accomplishment 
<A NAME="309"></A>to use money well than to use arms; but not to need it is more noble than 
<A NAME="310"></A>to use it.
<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR>When the noise of approbation and applause ceased, Cominius, resuming, 
<A NAME="312"></A>said: "It is idle, fellow-soldiers, to force and obtrude those other gifts 
<A NAME="313"></A>of ours on one who is unwilling to accept them; let us, therefore, give 
<A NAME="314"></A>him one of such a kind that he cannot well reject it; let us pass a vote, 
<A NAME="315"></A>I mean, that he shall hereafter be called Coriolanus, unless you think 
<A NAME="316"></A>that his performance at Corioli has itself anticipated any such resolution." 
<A NAME="317"></A>Hence, therefore, he had this third name of Coriolanus, making it all the 
<A NAME="318"></A>plainer that Caius was a personal proper name, and the second, or surname, 
<A NAME="319"></A>Marcius, one common to his house and family; the third being a subsequent 
<A NAME="320"></A>addition which used to be imposed either from some particular act or fortune, 
<A NAME="321"></A>bodily characteristic, or good quality of the bearer. Just as the Greeks, 
<A NAME="322"></A>too, gave additional names in old time, in some cases from some achievement, 
<A NAME="323"></A>Soter, for example, and Callinicus; or personal appearance, as Physcon 
<A NAME="324"></A>and Grypus; good qualities, Euergetes and Philadelphus; good fortune, Eudaemon, 
<A NAME="325"></A>the title of the second Battus. Several monarchs have also had names given 
<A NAME="326"></A>them in mockery, as Antigonus was called Doson, and Ptolemy, Lathyrus. 
<A NAME="327"></A>This sort of title was yet more common among the Romans. One of the Metelli 
<A NAME="328"></A>was surnamed Diadematus, because he walked about for a long time with a 
<A NAME="329"></A>bandage on his head to conceal a scar; and another, of the same family, 
<A NAME="330"></A>got the name of Celer, from the rapidity he displayed in giving a funeral 
<A NAME="331"></A>entertainment of gladiators within a few days after his father's death, 
<A NAME="332"></A>his speed and energy in doing which was thought extraordinary. There are 
<A NAME="333"></A>some, too, who even at this day take names from certain casual incidents 
<A NAME="334"></A>at their nativity: a child that is born when his father is away from home 
<A NAME="335"></A>is called Proculus; or Postumus, if after his decease; and when twins come 
<A NAME="336"></A>into the world, and one dies at the birth, the survivor has the name of 
<A NAME="337"></A>Vopiscus. From bodily peculiarities they derive not only their Syllas and 
<A NAME="338"></A>Nigers, but their Caeci and Claudii; wisely endeavouring to accustom their 
<A NAME="339"></A>people not to reckon either the loss of sight, or any other bodily misfortune, 
<A NAME="340"></A>as a matter of disgrace to them, but to answer to such names without shame, 
<A NAME="341"></A>as if they were really their own. But this discussion better befits another 
<A NAME="342"></A>place.
<A NAME="343"></A><BR><BR>The war against the Volscians was no sooner at an end, than the 
<A NAME="344"></A>popular orators revived domestic troubles, and raised another sedition, 
<A NAME="345"></A>without any new cause or complaint or just grievance to proceed upon, but 
<A NAME="346"></A>merely turning the very mischiefs that unavoidably ensued from their former 
<A NAME="347"></A>contests into a pretext against the patricians. The greatest part of their 
<A NAME="348"></A>arable land had been left unsown and without tillage, and the time of war 
<A NAME="349"></A>allowing them no means or leisure to import provision from other countries, 
<A NAME="350"></A>there was an extreme scarcity. The movers of the people then observing 
<A NAME="351"></A>that there was no corn to be bought, and that if there had been they had 
<A NAME="352"></A>no money to buy it, began to calumniate the wealthy with false stories 
<A NAME="353"></A>and whisper it about, as if they, out of their malice, had purposely contrived 
<A NAME="354"></A>the famine. Meanwhile, there came an embassy from the Velitrani, proposing 
<A NAME="355"></A>to deliver up their city to the Romans, and desiring they would send some 
<A NAME="356"></A>new inhabitants to people it, as a late pestilential disease had swept 
<A NAME="357"></A>away so many of the natives, that there was hardly a tenth part remaining 
<A NAME="358"></A>of their whole community. This necessity of the Velitrani was considered 
<A NAME="359"></A>by all more prudent people as most opportune in the present state of affairs; 
<A NAME="360"></A>since the dearth made it needful to ease the city of its superfluous members, 
<A NAME="361"></A>and they were in hope also, at the same time, to dissipate the gathering 
<A NAME="362"></A>sedition by ridding themselves of the more violent and heated partisans, 
<A NAME="363"></A>and discharging, so to say, the elements of disease and disorder in the 
<A NAME="364"></A>state. The consuls, therefore, singled out such citizens to supply the 
<A NAME="365"></A>desolation at Velitrae, and gave notice to others, that they should be 
<A NAME="366"></A>ready to march against the Volscians, with the politic design of preventing 
<A NAME="367"></A>intestine broils by employment abroad, and in the hope that when rich as 
<A NAME="368"></A>well as poor, plebeians and patricians, should be mingled again in the 
<A NAME="369"></A>same army and the same camp, and engage in one common service for the public, 
<A NAME="370"></A>it would mutually dispose them to reconciliation and 
<A NAME="371"></A>friendship.
<A NAME="372"></A><BR><BR>But Sicinnius and Brutus, the popular orators, interposed, crying 
<A NAME="373"></A>out that the consuls disguised the most cruel and barbarous action in the 
<A NAME="374"></A>world under that mild and plausible name of a colony, and were simply precipitating 
<A NAME="375"></A>so many poor citizens into a mere pit of destruction, bidding them settle 
<A NAME="376"></A>down in a country where the air was charged with disease, and the ground 
<A NAME="377"></A>covered with dead bodies, and expose themselves to the evil influence of 
<A NAME="378"></A>a strange and angered deity. And then, as if it would not satisfy their 
<A NAME="379"></A>hatred to destroy some by hunger, and offer others to the mercy of a plague, 
<A NAME="380"></A>they must proceed to involve them also in a needless war of their own making, 
<A NAME="381"></A>that no calamity might be wanting to complete the punishment of the citizens 
<A NAME="382"></A>for refusing to submit to that of slavery to the rich.
<A NAME="383"></A><BR><BR>By such addresses, the people were so possessed, that none of them 
<A NAME="384"></A>would appear upon the consular summons to be enlisted for the war; and 
<A NAME="385"></A>they showed entire aversion to the proposal for a new plantation; so that 
<A NAME="386"></A>the senate was at a loss what to say or do. But Marcius, who began now 
<A NAME="387"></A>to bear himself higher and to feel confidence in his past actions, conscious, 
<A NAME="388"></A>too, of the admiration of the best and greatest men of Rome, openly took 
<A NAME="389"></A>the lead in opposing the favourers of the people. The colony was despatched 
<A NAME="390"></A>to Velitrae, those that were chosen by lot being compelled to depart upon 
<A NAME="391"></A>high penalties; and when they obstinately persisted in refusing to enrol 
<A NAME="392"></A>themselves for the Volscian service, he mustered up his own clients, and 
<A NAME="393"></A>as many others as could be wrought upon by persuasion, and with these made 
<A NAME="394"></A>inroad into the territories of the Antiates, where, finding a considerable 
<A NAME="395"></A>quantity of corn, and collecting much booty, both of cattle and prisoners, 
<A NAME="396"></A>he reserved nothing for himself in private, but returned safe to Rome, 
<A NAME="397"></A>while those that ventured out with him were seen laden with pillage, and 
<A NAME="398"></A>driving their prey before them. This sight filled those that had stayed 
<A NAME="399"></A>at home with regret for their perverseness, with envy at their fortunate 
<A NAME="400"></A>fellow-citizens, and with feelings of dislike to Marcius, and hostility 
<A NAME="401"></A>to his growing reputation and power, which might probably be used against 
<A NAME="402"></A>the popular interest.
<A NAME="403"></A><BR><BR>Not long after he stood for the consulship: when, however, the 
<A NAME="404"></A>people began to relent and incline to favour him, being sensible what a 
<A NAME="405"></A>shame it would be to repulse and affront a man of his birth and merit, 
<A NAME="406"></A>after he had done them so many signal services. It was usual for those 
<A NAME="407"></A>who stood for offices among them to solicit and address themselves personally 
<A NAME="408"></A>to the citizens, presenting themselves in the forum with the toga on alone, 
<A NAME="409"></A>and no tunic under it; either to promote their supplications by the humility 
<A NAME="410"></A>of their dress, or that such as had received wounds might more readily 
<A NAME="411"></A>display those marks of their fortitude. Certainly, it was not out of suspicion 
<A NAME="412"></A>of bribery and corruption that they required all such petitioners for their 
<A NAME="413"></A>favour to appear ungirt and open, without any close garment; as it was 
<A NAME="414"></A>much later, and many ages after this, that buying and selling crept in 
<A NAME="415"></A>at their elections, and money became an ingredient in the public suffrages; 
<A NAME="416"></A>proceeding thence to attempt their tribunals, and even attack their camps, 
<A NAME="417"></A>till, by hiring the valiant, and enslaving iron to silver, it grew master 
<A NAME="418"></A>of the state, and turned their commonwealth into a monarchy. For it was 
<A NAME="419"></A>well and truly said that the first destroyer of the liberties of a people 
<A NAME="420"></A>is he who first gave them bounties and largesses. At Rome the mischief 
<A NAME="421"></A>seems to have stolen secretly in, and by little and little, not being at 
<A NAME="422"></A>once discerned and taken notice of. It is not certainly known who the man 
<A NAME="423"></A>was that did there first either bribe the citizens, or corrupt the courts; 
<A NAME="424"></A>whereas, in Athens, Anytus, the son of Anthemion, is said to have been 
<A NAME="425"></A>the first that gave money to the judges, when on his trial, toward the 
<A NAME="426"></A>latter end of the Peloponnesian war, for letting the fort of Pylos fall 
<A NAME="427"></A>into the hands of the enemy; in a period while the pure and golden race 
<A NAME="428"></A>of men were still in possession of the Roman forum.
<A NAME="429"></A><BR><BR>Marcius, therefore, as the fashion of candidates was, showing the 
<A NAME="430"></A>scars and gashes that were still visible on his body, from the many conflicts 
<A NAME="431"></A>in which he had signalized himself during a service of seventeen years 
<A NAME="432"></A>together, they were, so to say, put out of countenance at this display 
<A NAME="433"></A>of merit, and told one another that they ought in common modesty to create 
<A NAME="434"></A>him consul. But when the day of election was now come, and Marcius appeared 
<A NAME="435"></A>in the forum, with a pompous train of senators attending him, and the patricians 
<A NAME="436"></A>all manifested greater concern, and seemed to be exerting greater efforts, 
<A NAME="437"></A>than they had ever done before on the like occasion, the commons then fell 
<A NAME="438"></A>off again from the kindness they had conceived for him, and in the place 
<A NAME="439"></A>of their late benevolence, began to feel something of indignation and envy; 
<A NAME="440"></A>passions assisted by the fear they entertained, that if a man of such aristocratic 
<A NAME="441"></A>temper and so influential among the patricians should be invested with 
<A NAME="442"></A>the power which that office would give him, he might employ it to deprive 
<A NAME="443"></A>the people of all that liberty which was yet left them. In conclusion, 
<A NAME="444"></A>they rejected Marcius. Two other names were announced, to the great mortification 
<A NAME="445"></A>of the senators, who felt as if the indignity reflected rather upon themselves 
<A NAME="446"></A>than on Marcius. He, for his part, could not bear the affront with any 
<A NAME="447"></A>patience. He had always indulged his temper, and had regarded the proud 
<A NAME="448"></A>and contentious element of human nature as a sort of nobleness and magnanimity; 
<A NAME="449"></A>reason and discipline had not imbued him with that solidity and equanimity 
<A NAME="450"></A>which enters so largely into the virtues of the statesman. He had never 
<A NAME="451"></A>learned how essential it is for any one who undertakes public business, 
<A NAME="452"></A>and desires to deal with mankind, to avoid above all things that self-will, 
<A NAME="453"></A>which, as Plato says, belongs to the family of solitude; and to pursue, 
<A NAME="454"></A>above all things, that capacity so generally ridiculed, of submission to 
<A NAME="455"></A>ill-treatment. Marcius, straightforward and direct, and possessed with 
<A NAME="456"></A>the idea that to vanquish and overbear all opposition is the true part 
<A NAME="457"></A>of bravery, and never imagining that it was the weakness and womanishness 
<A NAME="458"></A>of his nature that broke out, so to say, in these ulcerations of anger, 
<A NAME="459"></A>retired, full of fury and bitterness against the people. The young patricians, 
<A NAME="460"></A>too, all that were proudest and most conscious of their noble birth, had 
<A NAME="461"></A>always been devoted to his interest, and, adhering to him now, with a fidelity 
<A NAME="462"></A>that did him no good, aggravated his resentment with the expression of 
<A NAME="463"></A>their indignation and condolence. He had been their captain, and their 
<A NAME="464"></A>willing instructor in the arts of war, when out upon expeditions, and their 
<A NAME="465"></A>model in that true emulation and love of excellence which makes men extol, 
<A NAME="466"></A>without envy or jealousy, each other's brave achievements.
<A NAME="467"></A><BR><BR>In the midst of these distempers, a large quantity of corn reached 
<A NAME="468"></A>Rome, a great part bought up in Italy, but an equal amount sent as a present 
<A NAME="469"></A>from Syracuse, from Gelo, then reigning there. Many began now to hope well 
<A NAME="470"></A>of their affairs, supposing the city, by this means, would be delivered 
<A NAME="471"></A>at once, both of its want and discord. A council, therefore, being presently 
<A NAME="472"></A>held, the people came flocking about the senate-house, eagerly awaiting 
<A NAME="473"></A>the issue of that deliberation, expecting that the market-prices would 
<A NAME="474"></A>now be less cruel, and that what had come as gift would be distributed 
<A NAME="475"></A>as such. There were some within who so advised the senate; but Marcius, 
<A NAME="476"></A>standing up, sharply inveighed against those who spoke in favour of the 
<A NAME="477"></A>multitude, calling them flatterers of the rabble, traitors to the nobility, 
<A NAME="478"></A>and alleging, that, by such gratifications, they did but cherish those 
<A NAME="479"></A>ill seeds of boldness and petulance that had been sown among the people, 
<A NAME="480"></A>to their own prejudice, which they should have done well to observe and 
<A NAME="481"></A>stifle at their first appearance, and not have suffered the plebeians to 
<A NAME="482"></A>grow so strong, by granting them magistrates of such authority as the tribunes. 
<A NAME="483"></A>They were, indeed, even now formidable to the state since everything they 
<A NAME="484"></A>desired was granted them; no constraint was put on their will; they refused 
<A NAME="485"></A>obedience to the consuls and, overthrowing all law and magistracy, gave 
<A NAME="486"></A>the title of magistrate to their private factious leaders. "When things 
<A NAME="487"></A>are come to such a pass for us to sit here and decree largesses and bounties 
<A NAME="488"></A>for them, like those Greeks where the populace is supreme and absolute, 
<A NAME="489"></A>what would it be else," said he, "but to take their disobedience into pay 
<A NAME="490"></A>and maintain it for the common ruin of us all? They certainly cannot look 
<A NAME="491"></A>upon these liberalities as a reward of public service, which they know 
<A NAME="492"></A>they have so often deserted; nor yet of those secessions, by which they 
<A NAME="493"></A>openly renounce their country; much less of the calumnies and slanders 
<A NAME="494"></A>they have been always so ready to entertain against the senate; but will 
<A NAME="495"></A>rather conclude that a bounty, which seems to have no other visible cause 
<A NAME="496"></A>or reason, must needs be the effect of our fear and flattery; and will, 
<A NAME="497"></A>therefore, set no limit to their disobedience, nor ever cease from disturbances 
<A NAME="498"></A>and sedition. Concession is mere madness; if we have any wisdom and resolution 
<A NAME="499"></A>at all, we shall, on the contrary, never rest till we have recovered from 
<A NAME="500"></A>them that tribunician power they have extorted from us; as being a plain 
<A NAME="501"></A>subversion of the consulship, and a perpetual ground of separation in our 
<A NAME="502"></A>city that is no longer one, as heretofore, but has in this received such 
<A NAME="503"></A>a wound and rupture as is never likely to close and unite again, or suffer 
<A NAME="504"></A>us to be of one mind, and to give over inflaming our distempers, and being 
<A NAME="505"></A>a torment to each other."
<A NAME="506"></A><BR><BR>Marcius, with much more to this purpose, succeeded, to an extraordinary 
<A NAME="507"></A>degree, in inspiring the younger men with the same furious sentiments, 
<A NAME="508"></A>and had almost all the wealthy on his side, who cried him up as the only 
<A NAME="509"></A>person their city had, superior alike to force and flattery; some of the 
<A NAME="510"></A>older men, however, opposed him, suspecting the consequences. As, indeed, 
<A NAME="511"></A>there came no good of it; for the tribunes, who were present, perceiving 
<A NAME="512"></A>how the proposal of Marcius took, ran out into the crowd with exclamations, 
<A NAME="513"></A>calling on the plebeians to stand together, and come in to their assistance. 
<A NAME="514"></A>The assembly met, and soon became tumultuous. The sum of what Marcius had 
<A NAME="515"></A>spoken, having been reported to the people, excited them to such fury, 
<A NAME="516"></A>that they were ready to break in upon the senate. The tribunes prevented 
<A NAME="517"></A>this, by laying all the blame on Coriolanus, whom, therefore, they cited 
<A NAME="518"></A>by their messengers to come before them and defend himself. And when he 
<A NAME="519"></A>contemptuously repulsed the officers who brought him the summons, they 
<A NAME="520"></A>came themselves, with the Aediles, or overseers of the market, proposing 
<A NAME="521"></A>to carry him away by force, and, accordingly, began to lay hold on his 
<A NAME="522"></A>person. The patricians, however, coming to his rescue, not only thrust 
<A NAME="523"></A>off the tribunes, but also beat the Aediles, that were their seconds in 
<A NAME="524"></A>the quarrel; night approaching, put an end to the contest. But, as soon 
<A NAME="525"></A>as it was day, the consuls, observing the people to be highly exasperated, 
<A NAME="526"></A>and that they ran from all quarters and gathered in the forum, were afraid 
<A NAME="527"></A>for the whole city, so that, convening the senate afresh, they desired 
<A NAME="528"></A>them to advise how they might best compose and pacify the incensed multitude 
<A NAME="529"></A>by equitable language and indulgent decrees; since, if they wisely considered 
<A NAME="530"></A>the state of things, they would find that it was no time to stand upon 
<A NAME="531"></A>terms of honour and a mere point of glory; such a critical conjuncture 
<A NAME="532"></A>called for gentle methods, and for temperate and humane counsels. The majority, 
<A NAME="533"></A>therefore, of the senators giving way, the consuls proceeded to pacify 
<A NAME="534"></A>the people in the best manner they were able, answering gently to such 
<A NAME="535"></A>imputations and charges as had been cast upon the senate, and using much 
<A NAME="536"></A>tenderness and moderation in the admonitions and reproofs they gave them. 
<A NAME="537"></A>On the point of the price of provisions, they said there should be no difference 
<A NAME="538"></A>at all between them. When a great part of the commonalty was grown cool, 
<A NAME="539"></A>and it appeared from their orderly and peaceful behaviour that they had 
<A NAME="540"></A>been very much appeased by what they had heard, the tribunes, standing 
<A NAME="541"></A>up, declared, in the name of the people, that since the senate was pleased 
<A NAME="542"></A>to act soberly and do them reason, they, likewise, should be ready to yield 
<A NAME="543"></A>in all that was fair and equitable on their side; they must insist, however, 
<A NAME="544"></A>that Marcius should give in his answer to the several charges as follows: 
<A NAME="545"></A>first, could he deny that he instigated the senate to overthrow the government 
<A NAME="546"></A>and annul the privileges of the people? and, in the next place, when called 
<A NAME="547"></A>to account for it, did he not disobey the summons? and, lastly, by the 
<A NAME="548"></A>blows and other public affronts to the Aediles, had he not done all he 
<A NAME="549"></A>could to commence a civil war?
<A NAME="550"></A><BR><BR>These articles were brought in against him, with a design either 
<A NAME="551"></A>to humble Marcius, and show his submission, if, contrary to his nature, 
<A NAME="552"></A>he should now court and sue the people; or, if he should follow his natural 
<A NAME="553"></A>disposition, which they rather expected from their judgment of his character, 
<A NAME="554"></A>then that he might thus make the breach final between himself and the 
<A NAME="555"></A>people.
<A NAME="556"></A><BR><BR>He came, therefore, as it were, to make his apology, and clear 
<A NAME="557"></A>himself; in which belief the people kept silence, and gave him a quiet 
<A NAME="558"></A>hearing. But when, instead of the submissive and deprecatory language expected 
<A NAME="559"></A>from him, he began to use not only an offensive kind of freedom, seeming 
<A NAME="560"></A>rather to accuse than apologize, but, as well by the tone of his voice 
<A NAME="561"></A>as the air of his countenance, displayed a security that was not far from 
<A NAME="562"></A>disdain and contempt of them, the whole multitude then became angry, and 
<A NAME="563"></A>gave evident signs of impatience and disgust; and Sicinnius, the most violent 
<A NAME="564"></A>of the tribunes, after a little private conference with his colleagues, 
<A NAME="565"></A>proceeded solemnly to pronounce before them all, that Marcius was condemned 
<A NAME="566"></A>to die by the tribunes of the people, and bid the Aediles take him to the 
<A NAME="567"></A>Tarpeian rock, and without delay throw him headlong from the precipice. 
<A NAME="568"></A>When they, however, in compliance with the order, came to seize upon his 
<A NAME="569"></A>body, many, even of the plebeian party, felt it to be a horrible and extravagant 
<A NAME="570"></A>act; the patricians, meantime, wholly beside themselves with distress and 
<A NAME="571"></A>horror, hurried up with cries to the rescue; and while some made actual 
<A NAME="572"></A>use of their hands to hinder the arrest, and surrounding Marcius, got him 
<A NAME="573"></A>in among them, others, as in so great a tumult no good could be done by 
<A NAME="574"></A>words, stretched out theirs, beseeching the multitude that they would not 
<A NAME="575"></A>proceed to such furious extremities; and at length, the friends and acquaintance 
<A NAME="576"></A>of the tribunes, wisely perceiving how impossible it would be to carry 
<A NAME="577"></A>off Marcius to punishment without much bloodshed and slaughter of the nobility, 
<A NAME="578"></A>persuaded them to forbear everything unusual and odious; not to despatch 
<A NAME="579"></A>him by any sudden violence, or without regular process, but refer the cause 
<A NAME="580"></A>to the general suffrage of the people. Sicinnius then, after a little pause, 
<A NAME="581"></A>turning to the patricians, demanded what their meaning was, thus forcibly 
<A NAME="582"></A>to rescue Marcius out of the people's hands, as they were going to punish 
<A NAME="583"></A>him; when it was replied by them, on the other side, and the question put, 
<A NAME="584"></A>"Rather, how came it into your minds, and what is it you design, thus to 
<A NAME="585"></A>drag one of the worthiest men of Rome, without trial, to a barbarous and 
<A NAME="586"></A>illegal execution?" "Very well," said Sicinnius, "you shall have no ground 
<A NAME="587"></A>in this respect for quarrel or complaint against the people. The people 
<A NAME="588"></A>grant your request, and your partisan shall be tried. We appoint you, Marcius," 
<A NAME="589"></A>directing his speech to him, "the third market-day ensuing, to appear and 
<A NAME="590"></A>defend yourself, and to try if you can satisfy the Roman citizens of your 
<A NAME="591"></A>innocence, who will then judge your case by vote." The patricians were 
<A NAME="592"></A>content with such a truce and respite for that time, and gladly returned 
<A NAME="593"></A>home, having for the present brought off Marcius in 
<A NAME="594"></A>safety.
<A NAME="595"></A><BR><BR>During the interval before the appointed time (for the Romans hold 
<A NAME="596"></A>their sessions every ninth day, which from that cause are called mundinoe 
<A NAME="597"></A>in Latin), a war fell out with the Antiates, likely to be of some continuance, 
<A NAME="598"></A>which gave them hope they might one way or other elude the judgment. The 
<A NAME="599"></A>people, they presumed, would become tractable, and their indignation lessen 
<A NAME="600"></A>and languish by degrees in so long a space, if occupation and war did not 
<A NAME="601"></A>wholly put it out of their mind. But when, contrary to expectation, they 
<A NAME="602"></A>made a speedy agreement with the people of Antium. and the army came back 
<A NAME="603"></A>to Rome, the patricians were again in great perplexity, and had frequent 
<A NAME="604"></A>meetings to consider how things might be arranged, without either abandoning 
<A NAME="605"></A>Marcius, or yet giving occasion to the popular orators to create new disorders. 
<A NAME="606"></A>Appius Claudius, whom they counted among the senators most averse to the 
<A NAME="607"></A>popular interest, made a solemn declaration, and told them beforehand, 
<A NAME="608"></A>that the senate would utterly destroy itself and betray the government, 
<A NAME="609"></A>if they should once suffer the people to assume the authority of pronouncing 
<A NAME="610"></A>sentence upon any of the patricians; but the oldest senators and most favourable 
<A NAME="611"></A>to the people maintained, on the other side, that the people would not 
<A NAME="612"></A>be so harsh and severe upon them, as some were pleased to imagine, but 
<A NAME="613"></A>rather become more gentle and humane upon the concession of that power, 
<A NAME="614"></A>since it was not contempt of the senate, but the impression of being contemned 
<A NAME="615"></A>by it, which made them pretend to such a prerogative. Let that he once 
<A NAME="616"></A>allowed them as a mark of respect and kind feeling, and the mere possession 
<A NAME="617"></A>of this power of voting would at once dispossess them of their 
<A NAME="618"></A>animosity.
<A NAME="619"></A><BR><BR>When, therefore, Marcius saw that the senate was in pain and suspense 
<A NAME="620"></A>upon his account, divided, as it were, betwixt their kindness for him and 
<A NAME="621"></A>their apprehensions from the people, he desired to know of the tribunes 
<A NAME="622"></A>what the crimes were they intended to charge him with, and what the heads 
<A NAME="623"></A>of the indictment they would oblige him to plead to before the people; 
<A NAME="624"></A>and being told by them that he was to be impeached for attempting usurpation, 
<A NAME="625"></A>and that they would prove him guilty of designing to establish arbitrary 
<A NAME="626"></A>government, stepping forth upon this, "Let me go then," he said, "to clear 
<A NAME="627"></A>myself from that imputation before an assembly of them; I freely offer 
<A NAME="628"></A>myself to any sort of trial, nor do I refuse any kind of punishment whatsoever; 
<A NAME="629"></A>only," he continued, "let what you now mention be really made my accusation, 
<A NAME="630"></A>and do not you play false with the senate." On their consenting to these 
<A NAME="631"></A>terms, he came to his trial. But when the people met together, the tribunes, 
<A NAME="632"></A>contrary to all former practice, extorted first, that votes should be taken, 
<A NAME="633"></A>not by centuries, but tribes; a change, by which the indigent and factious 
<A NAME="634"></A>rabble, that had no respect for honesty and justice, would be sure to carry 
<A NAME="635"></A>it against those who were rich and well known, and accustomed to serve 
<A NAME="636"></A>the state in war. In the next place, whereas they had engaged to prosecute 
<A NAME="637"></A>Marcius upon no other head but that of tyranny, which could never be made 
<A NAME="638"></A>out against him, they relinquished this plea, and urged instead, his language 
<A NAME="639"></A>in the senate against an abasement of the price of corn, and for the overthrow 
<A NAME="640"></A>of the tribunician power; adding further, as a new impeachment, the distribution 
<A NAME="641"></A>that was made by him of the spoil and booty he had taken from the Antiates, 
<A NAME="642"></A>when he overran their country, which he had divided among those that had 
<A NAME="643"></A>followed him, whereas it ought rather to have been brought into the public 
<A NAME="644"></A>treasury; which last accusation did, they say, more discompose Marcius 
<A NAME="645"></A>than all the rest, as he had not anticipated he should ever be questioned 
<A NAME="646"></A>on that subject, and, therefore, was less provided with any satisfactory 
<A NAME="647"></A>answer to it on the sudden. And when, by way of excuse, he began to magnify 
<A NAME="648"></A>the merits of those who had been partakers with him in the action, those 
<A NAME="649"></A>that had stayed at home, being more numerous than the other, interrupted 
<A NAME="650"></A>him with outcries. In conclusion, when they came to vote, a majority of 
<A NAME="651"></A>three tribes condemned him; the penalty being perpetual banishment. The 
<A NAME="652"></A>sentence of his condemnation being pronounced, the people went away with 
<A NAME="653"></A>greater triumph and exultation than they had ever shown for any victory 
<A NAME="654"></A>over enemies; while the senate was in grief and deep dejection, repenting 
<A NAME="655"></A>now and vexed to the soul that they had not done and suffered all things 
<A NAME="656"></A>rather than give way to the insolence of the people, and permit them to 
<A NAME="657"></A>assume and abuse so great an authority. There was no need then to look 
<A NAME="658"></A>at men's dresses, or other marks of distinction, to know one from another: 
<A NAME="659"></A>any one who was glad was, beyond all doubt, a plebeian, any one who looked 
<A NAME="660"></A>sorrowful, a patrician.
<A NAME="661"></A><BR><BR>Marcius alone, himself, was neither stunned nor humiliated. In 
<A NAME="662"></A>mien, carriage, and countenance he bore the appearance of entire composure, 
<A NAME="663"></A>and, while all his friends were full of distress, seemed the only man that 
<A NAME="664"></A>was not touched with his misfortune. Not that either reflection taught 
<A NAME="665"></A>him, or gentleness of temper made it natural for him to submit: he was 
<A NAME="666"></A>wholly possessed, on the contrary, with a profound and deep-seated fury, 
<A NAME="667"></A>which passes with many for no pain at all. And pain, it is true, transmuted, 
<A NAME="668"></A>so to say, by its own fiery heat into anger, loses every appearance of 
<A NAME="669"></A>depression and feebleness; the angry man makes a show of energy, as the 
<A NAME="670"></A>man in a high fever does of natural heat, while, in fact, all this action 
<A NAME="671"></A>of the soul is but mere diseased palpitation, distension, and inflammation. 
<A NAME="672"></A>That such was his distempered state appeared presently plainly enough in 
<A NAME="673"></A>his actions. On his return home, after saluting his mother and his wife, 
<A NAME="674"></A>who were all in tears and full of loud lamentations, and exhorting them 
<A NAME="675"></A>to moderate the sense they had of his calamity, he proceeded at once to 
<A NAME="676"></A>the city gates, whither all the nobility came to attend him; and so not 
<A NAME="677"></A>so much as taking anything with him, or making any request to the company, 
<A NAME="678"></A>he departed from them, having only three or four clients with him. He continued 
<A NAME="679"></A>solitary for a few days in a place in the country, distracted with a variety 
<A NAME="680"></A>of counsels, such as rage and indignation suggested to him; and proposing 
<A NAME="681"></A>to himself no honourable or useful end, but only how he might best satisfy 
<A NAME="682"></A>his revenge on the Romans, he resolved at length to raise up a heavy war 
<A NAME="683"></A>against them from their nearest neighbours. He determined, first to make 
<A NAME="684"></A>trial of the Volscians, whom he knew to be still vigorous and flourishing, 
<A NAME="685"></A>both in men and treasure, and he imagined their force and power was not 
<A NAME="686"></A>so much abated as their spite and anger increased by the late overthrows 
<A NAME="687"></A>they had received from the Romans.
<A NAME="688"></A><BR><BR>There was a man of Antium, called Tullus Aufidius, who, for his 
<A NAME="689"></A>wealth and bravery and the splendour of his family, had the respect and 
<A NAME="690"></A>privilege of a king among the Volscians, but whom Marcius knew to have 
<A NAME="691"></A>a particular hostility to himself, above all other Romans. Frequent menaces 
<A NAME="692"></A>and challenges had passed in battle between them, and those exchanges of 
<A NAME="693"></A>defiance to which their hot and eager emulation is apt to prompt young 
<A NAME="694"></A>soldiers had added private animosity to their national feelings of opposition. 
<A NAME="695"></A>Yet for all this, considering Tullus to have a certain generosity of temper, 
<A NAME="696"></A>and knowing that no Volscian, so much as he, desired an occasion to requite 
<A NAME="697"></A>upon the Romans the evils they had done, he did what much confirms the 
<A NAME="698"></A>saying, that-
<A NAME="699"></A><BR><BR>"Hard and unequal is with wrath the strife,
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>Which makes us buy its pleasure with our life." Putting on such a dress 
<A NAME="701"></A>as would make him appear to any whom he might meet most unlike what he 
<A NAME="702"></A>really was, like Ulysses-
<A NAME="703"></A><BR><BR>"The town be entered of his mortal foes."
<A NAME="704"></A><BR><BR>His arrival at Antium was about evening, and, though several met 
<A NAME="705"></A>him in the streets, yet he passed along without being known to any and 
<A NAME="706"></A>went directly to the house of Tullus, and, entering undiscovered, and went 
<A NAME="707"></A>up to the fire-hearth, and seated himself there without speaking a word, 
<A NAME="708"></A>covering up his head. Those of the family could not but wonder, and yet 
<A NAME="709"></A>they were afraid either to raise or question him, for there was a certain 
<A NAME="710"></A>air of majesty both in his posture and silence, but they recounted to Tullus, 
<A NAME="711"></A>being then at supper, the strangeness of this accident. He immediately 
<A NAME="712"></A>rose from table and came in, and asked who he was and for what business 
<A NAME="713"></A>be came thither; and then Marcius, unmuffling himself, and pausing awhile, 
<A NAME="714"></A>"If," said he, "you cannot call me to mind, Tullus, or do not believe your 
<A NAME="715"></A>eyes concerning me, I must of necessity be my own accuser. I am Caius Marcius, 
<A NAME="716"></A>the author of so much mischief to the Volscians; of which, were I seeking 
<A NAME="717"></A>to deny it, the surname of Coriolanus I now bear would be a sufficient 
<A NAME="718"></A>evidence against me. The one recompense I have received for all the hardships 
<A NAME="719"></A>and perils I have gone through was the title that proclaims my enmity to 
<A NAME="720"></A>your nation, and this is the only thing which is still left me. Of all 
<A NAME="721"></A>other advantages, I have been stripped and deprived by the envy and outrage 
<A NAME="722"></A>of the Roman people, and the cowardice and treachery of the magistrates 
<A NAME="723"></A>and those of my own order. I am driven out as an exile, and become an humble 
<A NAME="724"></A>suppliant at your hearth, not so much for safety and protection (should 
<A NAME="725"></A>I have come hither, had I been afraid to die?) as to seek vengeance against 
<A NAME="726"></A>those that expelled me; which, methinks, I have already obtained, by putting 
<A NAME="727"></A>myself into your hands. If, therefore, you have really a mind to attack 
<A NAME="728"></A>your enemies, come then, make use of that affliction you see me in to assist 
<A NAME="729"></A>the enterprise, and convert my personal infelicity into a common blessing 
<A NAME="730"></A>to the Volscians; as, indeed, I am likely to be more serviceable in fighting 
<A NAME="731"></A>for than against you, with the advantage which I now possess, of knowing 
<A NAME="732"></A>all the secrets of the enemy that I am attacking. But if you decline to 
<A NAME="733"></A>make any further attempts I am neither desirous to live myself, nor will 
<A NAME="734"></A>it be well in you to preserve a person who has been your rival and adversary 
<A NAME="735"></A>of old, and now, when he offers you his service, appears unprofitable and 
<A NAME="736"></A>useless to you."
<A NAME="737"></A><BR><BR>Tullus, on hearing this, was extremely rejoiced, and giving him 
<A NAME="738"></A>his right hand, exclaimed, "Rise, Marcius, and be of good courage; it is 
<A NAME="739"></A>a great happiness you bring to Antium, in the present use you make of yourself; 
<A NAME="740"></A>expect everything that is good from the Volscians." He then proceeded to 
<A NAME="741"></A>feast and entertain him with every display of kindness, and for several 
<A NAME="742"></A>days after they were in close deliberation together on the prospects of 
<A NAME="743"></A>a war.
<A NAME="744"></A><BR><BR>While this design was forming, there were great troubles and commotions 
<A NAME="745"></A>at Rome, from the animosity of the senators against the people, heightened 
<A NAME="746"></A>just now by the late condemnation of Marcius. Besides that their soothsayers 
<A NAME="747"></A>and priests, and even private persons, reported signs and prodigies not 
<A NAME="748"></A>to be neglected; one of which is stated to have occurred as follows: Titus 
<A NAME="749"></A>Latinus, a man of ordinary condition, but of a quiet and virtuous character, 
<A NAME="750"></A>free from all superstitious fancies, and yet more from vanity and exaggeration, 
<A NAME="751"></A>had an apparition in his sleep, as if Jupiter came and bade him tell the 
<A NAME="752"></A>senate, that it was with a bad and unacceptable dancer that they had headed 
<A NAME="753"></A>his procession. Having beheld the vision, he said, he did not much attend 
<A NAME="754"></A>to it at the first appearance; but after he had seen and slighted it a 
<A NAME="755"></A>second and third time, he had lost a hopeful son, and was himself struck 
<A NAME="756"></A>with a palsy. He was brought into the senate on a litter to tell this, 
<A NAME="757"></A>and the story goes that he had no sooner delivered his message there, but 
<A NAME="758"></A>he at once felt his strength return and got upon his legs, and went home 
<A NAME="759"></A>alone without need of any support. The senators, in wonder and surprise, 
<A NAME="760"></A>made a diligent search into the matter. That which his dream alluded to 
<A NAME="761"></A>was this: some citizen had, for some heinous offence, given up a servant 
<A NAME="762"></A>of his to the rest of his fellows with charge to whip him first through 
<A NAME="763"></A>the market, and then to kill him; and while they were executing this command, 
<A NAME="764"></A>and scourging the wretch, who screwed and turned himself into all manner 
<A NAME="765"></A>of shapes and unseemly motions, through the pain he was in, the solemn 
<A NAME="766"></A>procession in honour of Jupiter chanced to follow at their heels. Several 
<A NAME="767"></A>of the attendants on which were, indeed, scandalized at the sight, yet 
<A NAME="768"></A>no one of them interfered, or acted further in the matter than merely to 
<A NAME="769"></A>utter some common reproaches and execrations on a master who inflicted 
<A NAME="770"></A>so cruel a punishment. For the Romans treated their slaves with great humanity 
<A NAME="771"></A>in these times, when, working and labouring themselves, and living together 
<A NAME="772"></A>among them, they naturally were more gentle and familiar with them. It 
<A NAME="773"></A>was one of the severest punishments for a slave who had committed a fault 
<A NAME="774"></A>to have to take the piece of wood which supports the pole of a wagon, and 
<A NAME="775"></A>carry it about through the neighbourhood; a slave who had once undergone 
<A NAME="776"></A>the shame of this, and been thus seen by the household and the neighbours, 
<A NAME="777"></A>had no longer any trust or credit among them, and had the name of furcifer; 
<A NAME="778"></A>furca being the Latin word for a prop, or support.
<A NAME="779"></A><BR><BR>When, therefore, Latinus had related his dream, and the senators 
<A NAME="780"></A>were considering who this disagreeable and ungainly dancer could be, some 
<A NAME="781"></A>of the company, having been struck with the strangeness of the punishment, 
<A NAME="782"></A>called to mind and mentioned the miserable slave who was lashed through 
<A NAME="783"></A>the streets and afterwards put to death. The priests, when consulted, confirmed 
<A NAME="784"></A>the conjecture; the master was punished; and orders given for a new celebration 
<A NAME="785"></A>of the procession and the spectacles in honour of the god. Numa, in other 
<A NAME="786"></A>respects also a wise arranger of religious offices, would seem to have 
<A NAME="787"></A>been especially judicious in his direction, with a view to the attentiveness 
<A NAME="788"></A>of the people, that, when the magistrates or priests performed any divine 
<A NAME="789"></A>worship, a herald should go before, and proclaim with a loud voice, Hoc 
<A NAME="790"></A>age, Do this you are about, and so warn them to mind whatever sacred action 
<A NAME="791"></A>they were engaged in, and not suffer any business or worldly avocation 
<A NAME="792"></A>to disturb and interrupt it; most of the things which men do of this kind 
<A NAME="793"></A>being in manner forced from them, and effected by constraint. It is usual 
<A NAME="794"></A>with the Romans to recommence their sacrifices and processions and spectacles, 
<A NAME="795"></A>not only upon such a cause as this, but for any slighter reason. If but 
<A NAME="796"></A>one of the horses which drew the chariots called Tensae, upon which the 
<A NAME="797"></A>images of their gods were placed, happened to fail and falter, or if the 
<A NAME="798"></A>driver took hold of the reins with his left hand, they would decree that 
<A NAME="799"></A>the whole operation should commence anew; and, in latter ages, one and 
<A NAME="800"></A>the same sacrifice was performed thirty times over, because of the occurrence 
<A NAME="801"></A>of some defect or mistake or accident in the service. Such was the Roman 
<A NAME="802"></A>reverence and caution in religious matters.
<A NAME="803"></A><BR><BR>Marcius and Tullus were now secretly discoursing of their project 
<A NAME="804"></A>with the chief men of Antium, advising them to invade the Romans while 
<A NAME="805"></A>they were at variance among themselves. And when shame appeared to hinder 
<A NAME="806"></A>them from embracing the motion, as they had sworn to a truce and cessation 
<A NAME="807"></A>of arms for the space of two years, the Romans themselves soon furnished 
<A NAME="808"></A>them with a pretence, by making proclamation, out of some jealousy or slanderous 
<A NAME="809"></A>report, in the midst of the spectacles, that all the Volscians who had 
<A NAME="810"></A>come to see them should depart the city before sunset. Some affirm that 
<A NAME="811"></A>this was a contrivance of Marcius, who sent a man privately to the consuls, 
<A NAME="812"></A>falsely to accuse the Volscians of intending to fall upon the Romans during 
<A NAME="813"></A>the games, and to set the city on fire. This public affront roused and 
<A NAME="814"></A>inflamed their hostility to the Romans; and Tullus, perceiving it, made 
<A NAME="815"></A>his advantage of it, aggravating the fact, and working on their indignation, 
<A NAME="816"></A>till he persuaded them, at last, to despatch ambassadors to Rome, requiring 
<A NAME="817"></A>the Romans to restore that part of their country and those towns which 
<A NAME="818"></A>they had taken from the Volscians in the late war. When the Romans heard 
<A NAME="819"></A>the message, they indignantly replied that the Volscians were the first 
<A NAME="820"></A>that took up arms, but the Romans would be the last to lay them down. This 
<A NAME="821"></A>answer being brought back, Tullus called a general assembly of the Volscians; 
<A NAME="822"></A>and the vote passing for a war, he then proposed that they should call 
<A NAME="823"></A>in Marcius, laying aside the remembrance of former grudges, and assuring 
<A NAME="824"></A>themselves that the services they should now receive from him as a friend 
<A NAME="825"></A>and associate would abundantly outweigh any harm or damage he had done 
<A NAME="826"></A>them when he was their enemy. Marcius was accordingly summoned, and having 
<A NAME="827"></A>made his entrance, and spoken to the people, won their good opinion of 
<A NAME="828"></A>his capacity, his skill, counsel, and boldness, not less by his present 
<A NAME="829"></A>words than by his past actions. They joined him in commission with Tullus, 
<A NAME="830"></A>to have full power as the general of their forces in all that related to 
<A NAME="831"></A>the war. And he, fearing lest the time that would be requisite to bring 
<A NAME="832"></A>all the Volscians together in full preparation might be so long as to lose 
<A NAME="833"></A>him the opportunity of action, left order with the chief persons and magistrates 
<A NAME="834"></A>of the city to provide other things, while he himself, prevailing upon 
<A NAME="835"></A>the most forward to assemble and march out with him as volunteers without 
<A NAME="836"></A>staying to be enrolled, made a sudden inroad into the Roman confines, when 
<A NAME="837"></A>nobody expected him, and possessed himself of so much booty, that the Volscians 
<A NAME="838"></A>found they had more than they could either carry away or use in the camp. 
<A NAME="839"></A>The abundance of provision which he gained, and the waste and havoc of 
<A NAME="840"></A>the country which he made, were, however, of themselves and in his account, 
<A NAME="841"></A>the smallest results of that invasion; the great mischief he intended, 
<A NAME="842"></A>and his special object in all, was to increase at Rome the suspicions entertained 
<A NAME="843"></A>of the patricians, and to make them upon worse terms with the people. With 
<A NAME="844"></A>this view, while spoiling all the fields and destroying the property of 
<A NAME="845"></A>other men, he took special care to preserve their farms and lands untouched, 
<A NAME="846"></A>and would not allow his soldiers to ravage there, or seize upon anything 
<A NAME="847"></A>which belonged to them. From hence their invectives and quarrels against 
<A NAME="848"></A>one another broke out afresh, and rose to a greater height than ever; the 
<A NAME="849"></A>senators reproaching those of the commonalty with their late injustice 
<A NAME="850"></A>to Marcius; while the plebeians, on their side did not hesitate to accuse 
<A NAME="851"></A>them of having, out of spite and revenge, solicited him to this enterprise, 
<A NAME="852"></A>and thus, when others were involved in the miseries of a war by their means, 
<A NAME="853"></A>they sat like unconcerned spectators, as being furnished with a guardian 
<A NAME="854"></A>and protector abroad of their wealth and fortunes, in the very person of 
<A NAME="855"></A>the public enemy. After this incursion and exploit, which was of great 
<A NAME="856"></A>advantage to the Volscians, as they learned by it to grow more hardy and 
<A NAME="857"></A>to contemn their enemy, Marcius drew them off, and returned in 
<A NAME="858"></A>safety.
<A NAME="859"></A><BR><BR>But when the whole strength of the Volscians was brought together 
<A NAME="860"></A>in the field, with great expedition and alacrity, it appeared so considerable 
<A NAME="861"></A>a body, that they agreed to leave part in garrison, for the security of 
<A NAME="862"></A>their towns, and with the other part to march against the Romans. Marcius 
<A NAME="863"></A>now desired Tullus to choose which of the two charges would be most agreeable 
<A NAME="864"></A>to him. Tullus answered that since he knew Marcius to be equally valiant 
<A NAME="865"></A>with himself, and far more fortunate, he would have him take the command 
<A NAME="866"></A>of those that were going out to the war, while he made it his care to defend 
<A NAME="867"></A>their cities at home and provide all conveniences for the army abroad. 
<A NAME="868"></A>Marcius, thus reinforced, and much stronger than before, moved first towards 
<A NAME="869"></A>the city called Circaeum, a Roman colony. He received its surrender and 
<A NAME="870"></A>did the inhabitants no injury; passing thence, he entered and laid waste 
<A NAME="871"></A>the country of the Latins, where he expected the Romans would meet him, 
<A NAME="872"></A>as the Latins were their confederates and allies, and had often sent to 
<A NAME="873"></A>demand succours from them. The people, however, on their part, showing 
<A NAME="874"></A>little inclination for the service, and the consuls themselves being unwilling 
<A NAME="875"></A>to run the hazard of a battle, when the time of their office was almost 
<A NAME="876"></A>ready to expire, they dismissed the Latin ambassadors without any effect; 
<A NAME="877"></A>so that Marcius, finding no army to oppose him, marched up to their cities, 
<A NAME="878"></A>and having taken by force Toleria, Lavici, Peda, and Bola, all of which 
<A NAME="879"></A>offered resistance, not only plundered their houses, but made a prey likewise 
<A NAME="880"></A>of their persons. Meantime he showed particular regard for all such as 
<A NAME="881"></A>came over to his party, and, for fear they might sustain any damage against 
<A NAME="882"></A>his will, encamped at the greatest distance he could, and wholly abstained 
<A NAME="883"></A>from the lands of their property.
<A NAME="884"></A><BR><BR>After, however, that he had made himself master of Bola, a town 
<A NAME="885"></A>not above ten miles from Rome, where he found great treasure, and put almost 
<A NAME="886"></A>all the adults to the sword; and when on this, the other Volscians that 
<A NAME="887"></A>were ordered to stay behind and protect their cities, hearing of his achievements 
<A NAME="888"></A>and success, had not patience to remain any longer at home, but came hastening 
<A NAME="889"></A>in their arms to Marcius, saying that he alone was their general and the 
<A NAME="890"></A>sole commander they would own; with all this, his name and renown spread 
<A NAME="891"></A>throughout all Italy, and universal wonder prevailed at the sudden and 
<A NAME="892"></A>mighty revolution in the fortunes of two nations which the loss and the 
<A NAME="893"></A>accession of a single man had effected.
<A NAME="894"></A><BR><BR>All at Rome was in great disorder; they were utterly averse from 
<A NAME="895"></A>fighting, and spent their whole time in cabals and disputes and reproaches 
<A NAME="896"></A>against each other; until news was brought that the enemy had laid close 
<A NAME="897"></A>siege to Lavinium, where were the images and sacred things of their tutelar 
<A NAME="898"></A>gods, and from whence they derived the origin of their nation, that being 
<A NAME="899"></A>the first city which Aeneas built in Italy. These tidings produced a change 
<A NAME="900"></A>as universal as it was extraordinary in the thoughts and inclinations of 
<A NAME="901"></A>the people, but occasioned a yet stranger revulsion of feelings among the 
<A NAME="902"></A>patricians. The people now were for repealing the sentence against Marcius, 
<A NAME="903"></A>and calling him back into the city; whereas the senate, being assembled 
<A NAME="904"></A>to preconsider the decree, opposed and finally rejected the proposal, either 
<A NAME="905"></A>out of the mere humour of contradicting and withstanding the people in 
<A NAME="906"></A>whatever they should desire, or because they were unwilling, perhaps, that 
<A NAME="907"></A>he should owe his restoration to their kindness; or having now conceived 
<A NAME="908"></A>a displeasure against Marcius himself, who was bringing distress upon all 
<A NAME="909"></A>alike, though he had not been ill-treated by all, and was become a declared 
<A NAME="910"></A>enemy to his whole country, though he knew well enough that the principal 
<A NAME="911"></A>and all the better men condoled with him and suffered in his 
<A NAME="912"></A>injuries.
<A NAME="913"></A><BR><BR>This resolution of theirs being made public, the people could proceed 
<A NAME="914"></A>no further, having no authority to pass anything by suffrage, and enact 
<A NAME="915"></A>it for a law, without a previous decree from the senate. When Marcius heard 
<A NAME="916"></A>of this, he was more exasperated than ever, and, quitting the siege of 
<A NAME="917"></A>Lavinium, marched furiously towards Rome, and encamped at a place called 
<A NAME="918"></A>the Cluilian ditches, about five miles from the city. The nearness of his 
<A NAME="919"></A>approach did, indeed, create much terror and disturbance, yet it also ended 
<A NAME="920"></A>their dissensions for the present; as nobody now, whether consul or senator, 
<A NAME="921"></A>durst any longer contradict the people in their design of recalling Marcius; 
<A NAME="922"></A>but, seeing their women running affrighted up and down the streets, and 
<A NAME="923"></A>the old men at prayer in every temple with tears and supplications, and 
<A NAME="924"></A>that, in short, there was a general absence among them both of courage 
<A NAME="925"></A>and wisdom to provide for their own safety, they came at last to be all 
<A NAME="926"></A>of one mind, that the people had been in the right to propose as they did 
<A NAME="927"></A>a reconciliation with Marcius, and that the senate was guilty of a fatal 
<A NAME="928"></A>error to begin a quarrel with him when it was a time to forget offences, 
<A NAME="929"></A>and they should have studied rather to appease him. It was, therefore, 
<A NAME="930"></A>unanimously agreed by all parties, that ambassadors should be despatched, 
<A NAME="931"></A>offering him return to his country, and desiring he would free them from 
<A NAME="932"></A>the terrors and distresses of the war. The persons sent by the senate with 
<A NAME="933"></A>this message were chosen out of his kindred and acquaintance, who naturally 
<A NAME="934"></A>expected a very kind reception at their first interview, upon the score 
<A NAME="935"></A>of that relation and their old familiarity and friendship with him; in 
<A NAME="936"></A>which, however, they were much mistaken. Being led through the enemy's 
<A NAME="937"></A>camp, they found him sitting in state amidst the chief men of the Volscians, 
<A NAME="938"></A>looking insupportably proud and arrogant. He bade them declare the cause 
<A NAME="939"></A>of their coming, which they did in the most gentle and tender terms, and 
<A NAME="940"></A>with a behaviour suitable to their language. When they had made an end 
<A NAME="941"></A>of speaking, he returned them a sharp answer, full of bitterness and angry 
<A NAME="942"></A>resentment, as to what concerned himself and the ill-usage he had received 
<A NAME="943"></A>from them; but as general of the Volscians, he demanded restitution of 
<A NAME="944"></A>the cities and the lands which had been seized upon during the late war, 
<A NAME="945"></A>and that the same rights and franchises should be granted them at Rome, 
<A NAME="946"></A>which had been before accorded to the Latins; since there could be no assurance 
<A NAME="947"></A>that a peace would be firm and lasting without fair and just conditions 
<A NAME="948"></A>on both sides. He allowed them thirty days to consider and 
<A NAME="949"></A>resolve.
<A NAME="950"></A><BR><BR>The ambassadors being departed, he withdrew his forces out of the 
<A NAME="951"></A>Roman territory. This, those of the Volscians who had long envied his reputation, 
<A NAME="952"></A>and could not endure to see the influence he had with the people, laid 
<A NAME="953"></A>hold of, as the first matter of complaint against him. Among them was also 
<A NAME="954"></A>Tullus himself, not for any wrong done him personally by Marcius, but through 
<A NAME="955"></A>the weakness incident to human nature, He could not help feeling mortified 
<A NAME="956"></A>to find his own glory thus totally obscured, and himself overlooked and 
<A NAME="957"></A>neglected now by the Volscians, who had so great an opinion of their new 
<A NAME="958"></A>leader, that he alone was all to them, while other captains, they thought, 
<A NAME="959"></A>should be content with that share of power which he might think fit to 
<A NAME="960"></A>accord. From hence the first seeds of complaint and accusation were scattered 
<A NAME="961"></A>about in secret, and the malcontents met and heightened each other's indignation, 
<A NAME="962"></A>saying, that to retreat as he did was in effect to betray and deliver up 
<A NAME="963"></A>though not their cities and their arms, yet what was as bad, the critical 
<A NAME="964"></A>times and opportunities for action, on which depend the preservation or 
<A NAME="965"></A>the loss of everything else; since in less than thirty days' space, for 
<A NAME="966"></A>which he had given a respite for the war, there might happen the greatest 
<A NAME="967"></A>changes in the world. Yet Marcius spent not any part of the time idly, 
<A NAME="968"></A>but attacked the confederates of the enemy, ravaged their land, and took 
<A NAME="969"></A>from them seven great and populous cities in that interval. The Romans, 
<A NAME="970"></A>in the meanwhile, durst not venture out to their relief; but were utterly 
<A NAME="971"></A>fearful, and showed no more disposition or capacity for action than if 
<A NAME="972"></A>their bodies had been struck with a palsy, and became destitute of sense 
<A NAME="973"></A>and motion. But when the thirty days were expired, and Marcius appeared 
<A NAME="974"></A>again with his whole army, they sent another embassy, to beseech him that 
<A NAME="975"></A>he would moderate his displeasure and would withdraw the Volscian army, 
<A NAME="976"></A>and then make any proposals he thought best for both parties; the Romans 
<A NAME="977"></A>would make no concessions to menaces, but if it were his opinion that the 
<A NAME="978"></A>Volscians ought to have any favour shown them, upon laying down their arms 
<A NAME="979"></A>they might obtain all they could in reason desire.
<A NAME="980"></A><BR><BR>The reply of Marcius was, that he should make no answer to this 
<A NAME="981"></A>as general of the Volscians, but, in the quality still of a Roman citizen, 
<A NAME="982"></A>he would advise and exhort them, as the case stood, not to carry it so 
<A NAME="983"></A>high, but think rather of just compliance, and return to him, before three 
<A NAME="984"></A>days were at an end, with a ratification of his previous demands; otherwise, 
<A NAME="985"></A>they must understand that they could not have any further freedom of passing 
<A NAME="986"></A>through his camp upon idle errands.
<A NAME="987"></A><BR><BR>When the ambassadors were come back, and had acquainted the senate 
<A NAME="988"></A>with the answer, seeing the whole state now threatened as it were by a 
<A NAME="989"></A>tempest, and the waves ready to overwhelm them, they were forced, as we 
<A NAME="990"></A>say in extreme perils, to let down the sacred anchor. A decree was made, 
<A NAME="991"></A>that the whole order of their priests, those who initiated in the mysteries 
<A NAME="992"></A>or had the custody of them, and those who, according to the ancient practice 
<A NAME="993"></A>of the country, divined from birds, should all and every one of them go 
<A NAME="994"></A>in full procession to Marcius with their pontifical array, and the dress 
<A NAME="995"></A>and habit which they respectively used in their several functions, and 
<A NAME="996"></A>should urge him, as before, to withdraw his forces, and then treat with 
<A NAME="997"></A>his countrymen in favour of the Volscians. He consented so far, indeed, 
<A NAME="998"></A>as to give the deputation an admittance into his camp, but granted nothing 
<A NAME="999"></A>at all, nor so much as expressed himself more mildly; but without capitulating 
<A NAME="1000"></A>or receding, bade them once for all choose whether they would yield or 
<A NAME="1001"></A>fight, since the old terms were the only terms of peace. When this solemn 
<A NAME="1002"></A>application proved ineffectual, the priests, too, returning unsuccessful, 
<A NAME="1003"></A>they determined to sit still within the city and keep watch about their 
<A NAME="1004"></A>walls, intending only to repulse the enemy, should he offer to attack them, 
<A NAME="1005"></A>and placing their hopes chiefly in time and in extraordinary accidents 
<A NAME="1006"></A>of fortune; as to themselves, they felt incapable of doing anything for 
<A NAME="1007"></A>their own deliverance; mere confusion and terror and ill-boding reports 
<A NAME="1008"></A>possessed the whole city; till at last a thing happened not unlike what 
<A NAME="1009"></A>we so often find represented, without, however, being accepted as true 
<A NAME="1010"></A>by people in general, in Homer. On some great and unusual occasion we find 
<A NAME="1011"></A>him say-
<A NAME="1012"></A><BR><BR>"But him the blue-eyed goddess did inspire; and 
<A NAME="1013"></A>elsewhere-
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR><BR>"But some immortal turned my mind away,
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR>To think what others of the deed would say;" and 
<A NAME="1016"></A>again-
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR><BR>"Were't his own thought or were't a god's command?" People are 
<A NAME="1018"></A>apt, in such passages, to censure and disregard the poet as if, by the 
<A NAME="1019"></A>introduction of mere impossibilities and idle fictions, he were denying 
<A NAME="1020"></A>the action of a man's own deliberate thought and free choice; which is 
<A NAME="1021"></A>not, in the least, the case in Homer's representation, where the ordinary, 
<A NAME="1022"></A>probable, and habitual conclusions that common reason leads to are continually 
<A NAME="1023"></A>ascribed to our own direct agency. He certainly says frequently 
<A NAME="1024"></A>enough-
<A NAME="1025"></A><BR><BR>"But I consulted with my own great soul;" or, as in another 
<A NAME="1026"></A>passage-
<A NAME="1027"></A><BR><BR>"He spoke. Achilles, with quick pain possessed,
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR>Resolved two purposes in his strong breast; and in a 
<A NAME="1029"></A>third
<A NAME="1030"></A><BR><BR>"-Yet never to her wishes won
<A NAME="1031"></A><BR>The just mind of the brave Bellerophon."
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR><BR>But where the act is something out of the way and extraordinary, 
<A NAME="1033"></A>and seems in a manner to demand some impulse of divine possession and sudden 
<A NAME="1034"></A>inspiration to account for it, here he does introduce divine agency, not 
<A NAME="1035"></A>to destroy, but to prompt the human will; not to create in us another agency, 
<A NAME="1036"></A>but offering images to stimulate our own; images that in no sort or kind 
<A NAME="1037"></A>make our action involuntary, but give occasion rather to spontaneous action, 
<A NAME="1038"></A>aided and sustained by feelings of confidence and hope. For either we must 
<A NAME="1039"></A>totally dismiss and exclude divine influences from every kind of causality 
<A NAME="1040"></A>and origination in what we do, or else what other way can we conceive in 
<A NAME="1041"></A>which divine aid and cooperation can act? Certainly we cannot suppose that 
<A NAME="1042"></A>the divine beings actually and literally turn our bodies and direct our 
<A NAME="1043"></A>hands and our feet this way or that, to do what is right: it is obvious 
<A NAME="1044"></A>that they must actuate the practical and elective element of our nature, 
<A NAME="1045"></A>by certain initial occasions, by images presented to the imagination, and 
<A NAME="1046"></A>thoughts suggested to the mind, such either as to excite it to, or avert 
<A NAME="1047"></A>and withhold it from, any particular course.
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR><BR>In the perplexity which I have described, the Roman women went, 
<A NAME="1049"></A>some to other temples, but the greater part, and the ladies of highest 
<A NAME="1050"></A>rank, to the altar of Jupiter Capitolinus. Among these suppliants was Valeria, 
<A NAME="1051"></A>sister to the great Poplicola, who did the Romans eminent service both 
<A NAME="1052"></A>in peace and war. Poplicola himself was now deceased, as is told in the 
<A NAME="1053"></A>history of his life; but Valeria lived still, and enjoyed great respect 
<A NAME="1054"></A>and honour at Rome, her life and conduct no way disparaging her birth. 
<A NAME="1055"></A>She, suddenly seized with the sort of instinct or emotion of mind which 
<A NAME="1056"></A>I have described, and happily lighting, not without divine guidance, on 
<A NAME="1057"></A>the right expedient, both rose herself, and bade the others rise, and went 
<A NAME="1058"></A>directly with them to the house of Volumnia, the mother of Marcius. And 
<A NAME="1059"></A>coming in and finding her sitting with her daughter-in-law, and with her 
<A NAME="1060"></A>little grandchildren on her lap, Valeria, then surrounded by her female 
<A NAME="1061"></A>companions, spoke in the name of them all:-
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR><BR>"We that now make our appearance, O Volumnia, and you, Vergilia, 
<A NAME="1063"></A>are come as mere women to women, not by direction of the senate, or an 
<A NAME="1064"></A>order from the consuls, or the appointment of any other magistrate; but 
<A NAME="1065"></A>the divine being himself, as I conceive, moved to compassion by our prayers, 
<A NAME="1066"></A>prompted us to visit you in a body, and request a thing on which our own 
<A NAME="1067"></A>and the common safety depends, and which, if you consent to it, will raise 
<A NAME="1068"></A>your glory above that of the daughters of the Sabines, who won over their 
<A NAME="1069"></A>fathers and their husbands from mortal enmity to peace and friendship. 
<A NAME="1070"></A>Arise and come with us to Marcius; join in our supplication, and bear for 
<A NAME="1071"></A>your country this true and just testimony on her behalf; that, notwithstanding 
<A NAME="1072"></A>the many mischiefs that have been done her, yet she has never outraged 
<A NAME="1073"></A>you, nor so much as thought of treating you ill, in all her resentment, 
<A NAME="1074"></A>but does now restore you safe into his hands, though there be small likelihood 
<A NAME="1075"></A>she should obtain from him any equitable terms."
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR><BR>The words of Valeria were seconded by the acclamations of the other 
<A NAME="1077"></A>women, to which Volumnia made answer:-
<A NAME="1078"></A><BR><BR>"I and Vergilia, my country-women, have an equal share with you 
<A NAME="1079"></A>all in the common miseries, and we have the additional sorrow, which is 
<A NAME="1080"></A>wholly ours, that we have lost the merit and good fame of Marcius, and 
<A NAME="1081"></A>see his person confined, rather than protected, by the arms of the enemy. 
<A NAME="1082"></A>Yet I account this the greatest of all misfortunes, if indeed the affairs 
<A NAME="1083"></A>of Rome be sunk
