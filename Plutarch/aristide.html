<BR>(died ca. 468 B.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Aristides, the son of Lysimachus, was of the tribe Antiochis, and township 
<A NAME="11"></A>of Alopece. As to wealth, statements differ; some say he passed his life 
<A NAME="12"></A>in extreme poverty, and left behind him two daughters whose indigence long 
<A NAME="13"></A>kept them unmarried; but Demetrius, the Phalerian, in opposition to this 
<A NAME="14"></A>general report, professes in his Socrates to know a farm at Phalerum going 
<A NAME="15"></A>by Aristides's name, where he was interred; and, as marks of his opulence, 
<A NAME="16"></A>adduces first, the office of archon eponymus, which he obtained by the 
<A NAME="17"></A>lot of the bean; which was confined to the highest assessed families, called 
<A NAME="18"></A>the Pentacosiomedimni; second, the ostracism, which was not usually inflicted 
<A NAME="19"></A>on the poorer citizens, but on those of great houses, whose station exposed 
<A NAME="20"></A>them to envy; third and last, that he left certain tripods in the temple 
<A NAME="21"></A>of Bacchus, offerings for his victory in conducting the representation 
<A NAME="22"></A>of dramatic performances, which were even in our age still to be seen, 
<A NAME="23"></A>retaining this inscription upon them, "The tribe Antiochis obtained the 
<A NAME="24"></A>victory: Aristides defrayed the charges: Archestratus's play was acted." 
<A NAME="25"></A>But this argument, though in appearance the strongest, is of the least 
<A NAME="26"></A>moment of any. For Epaminondas, who all the world knows was educated, and 
<A NAME="27"></A>lived his whole life in much poverty, and also Plato, the philosopher, 
<A NAME="28"></A>exhibited magnificent shows, the one an entertainment of flute-players, 
<A NAME="29"></A>the other of dithyrambic singers; Dion, the Syracusan, supplying the expenses 
<A NAME="30"></A>of the latter, and Pelopidas those of Epaminondas. For good men do not 
<A NAME="31"></A>allow themselves in any inveterate and irreconcilable hostility to receiving 
<A NAME="32"></A>presents from their friends, but while looking upon those that are accepted 
<A NAME="33"></A>to be hoarded up and with avaricious intentions as sordid and mean, they 
<A NAME="34"></A>do not refuse such as, apart from all profit, gratify the pure love of 
<A NAME="35"></A>honour and magnificence. Panaetius, again, shows that Demetrius was deceived 
<A NAME="36"></A>concerning the tripod by an identity of name. For, from the Persian war 
<A NAME="37"></A>to the end of the Peloponnesian, there are upon record only two of the 
<A NAME="38"></A>name of Aristides who defrayed the expense of representing plays and gained 
<A NAME="39"></A>the prize, neither of which was the same with the son of Lysimachus; but 
<A NAME="40"></A>the father of the one was Xenophilus, and the other lived at a much later 
<A NAME="41"></A>time, as the way of writing, which is that in use since the time of Euclides, 
<A NAME="42"></A>and the addition of the name of Archestratus prove, a name which, in the 
<A NAME="43"></A>time of the Persian war, no writer mentions, but which several, during 
<A NAME="44"></A>the Peloponnesian war, record as that of a dramatic poet. The argument 
<A NAME="45"></A>of Panaetius requires to be more closely considered. But as for the ostracism, 
<A NAME="46"></A>every one was liable to it, whom his reputation, birth, or eloquence raised 
<A NAME="47"></A>above the common level; insomuch that even Damon, preceptor to Pericles, 
<A NAME="48"></A>was thus banished, because he seemed a man of more than ordinary sense. 
<A NAME="49"></A>And, moreover, Idomeneus says that Aristides was not made archon by the 
<A NAME="50"></A>lot of the bean, but the free election of the people. And if he held the 
<A NAME="51"></A>office after the battle of Plataea, as Demetrius himself has written, it 
<A NAME="52"></A>is very probable that his great reputation and success in the war made 
<A NAME="53"></A>him be preferred for his virtue to an office which others received in consideration 
<A NAME="54"></A>of their wealth. But Demetrius manifestly is eager not only to exempt Aristides, 
<A NAME="55"></A>but Socrates likewise, from poverty, as from a great evil; telling us that 
<A NAME="56"></A>the latter had not only a house of his own, but also seventy minae put 
<A NAME="57"></A>out at interest with Crito.
<A NAME="58"></A><BR><BR>Aristides being the friend and supporter of that Clisthenes, who 
<A NAME="59"></A>settled the government after the expulsion of the tyrants, and emulating 
<A NAME="60"></A>and admiring Lycurgus, the Lacedaemonian, above all politicians, adhered 
<A NAME="61"></A>to the aristocratical principles of government; and had Themistocles, son 
<A NAME="62"></A>to Neocles, his adversary on the side of the populace. Some say that, being 
<A NAME="63"></A>boys and bred up together from their infancy, they were always at variance 
<A NAME="64"></A>with each other in all their words and actions, as well serious as playful, 
<A NAME="65"></A>and that in this their early contention they soon made proof of their natural 
<A NAME="66"></A>inclinations; the one being ready, adventurous, and subtle, engaging readily 
<A NAME="67"></A>and eagerly in everything; the other of a staid and settled temper, intent 
<A NAME="68"></A>on the exercise of justice, not admitting any degree of falsity, indecorum, 
<A NAME="69"></A>or trickery, no, not so much as at his play. Ariston of Chios says the 
<A NAME="70"></A>first origin of the enmity which rose to so great a height was a love affair; 
<A NAME="71"></A>they were rivals for the affection of the beautiful Stesilaus of Ceos, 
<A NAME="72"></A>and were passionate beyond all moderation, and did not lay aside their 
<A NAME="73"></A>animosity when the beauty that had excited it passed away; but, as if it 
<A NAME="74"></A>had only exercised them in it, immediately carried their beats and differences 
<A NAME="75"></A>into public business.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR>Themistocles, therefore, joining an association of partisans, fortified 
<A NAME="77"></A>himself with considerable strength; insomuch that when some one told him 
<A NAME="78"></A>that were he impartial he would make a good magistrate; "I wish," replied 
<A NAME="79"></A>he, "I may never sit on that tribunal where my friends shall not plead 
<A NAME="80"></A>a greater privilege than strangers." But Aristides walked, so to say, alone 
<A NAME="81"></A>on his own path in politics, being unwilling, in the first place, to go 
<A NAME="82"></A>along with his associates in ill-doing, or to cause them vexation by not 
<A NAME="83"></A>gratifying their wishes; and, secondly, observing that many were encouraged 
<A NAME="84"></A>by the support they had in their friends to act injuriously, he was cautious; 
<A NAME="85"></A>being of opinion that the integrity of his words and actions was the only 
<A NAME="86"></A>right security for a good citizen.
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR>However, Themistocles making many dangerous alterations, and withstanding 
<A NAME="88"></A>and interrupting him in the whole series of his actions, Aristides also 
<A NAME="89"></A>was necessitated to set himself against all Themistocles did, partly in 
<A NAME="90"></A>self-defence, and partly to impede his power from still increasing by the 
<A NAME="91"></A>favour of the multitude; esteeming it better to let slip some public conveniences, 
<A NAME="92"></A>rather than that he by prevailing should become powerful in all things. 
<A NAME="93"></A>In fine, when he once had opposed Themistocles in some measures that were 
<A NAME="94"></A>expedient, and had got the better of him, he could not refrain from saying, 
<A NAME="95"></A>when he left the assembly, that unless they sent Themistocles and himself 
<A NAME="96"></A>to the barathum, there could be no safety for Athens. Another time, when 
<A NAME="97"></A>urging some proposal upon the people, though there were much opposition 
<A NAME="98"></A>and stirring against it, he yet was gaining the day; but just as the president 
<A NAME="99"></A>of the assembly was about to put it to the vote, perceiving by what had 
<A NAME="100"></A>been said in debate the inexpediency of his advice, he let it fall. Also 
<A NAME="101"></A>he often brought in his bills by other persons, lest Themistocles, through 
<A NAME="102"></A>party spirit against him, should be any hindrance to the good of the 
<A NAME="103"></A>public.
<A NAME="104"></A><BR><BR>In all the vicissitudes of public affairs, the constancy he showed 
<A NAME="105"></A>was admirable, not being elated with honours, and demeaning himself tranquilly 
<A NAME="106"></A>and sedately in adversity; holding the opinion that he ought to offer himself 
<A NAME="107"></A>to the service of his country without mercenary views and irrespectively 
<A NAME="108"></A>of any reward, not only of riches, but even of glory itself. Hence it came, 
<A NAME="109"></A>probably, that at the recital of these verses of Aeschylus in the theatre, 
<A NAME="110"></A>relating to Amphiaraus-
<A NAME="111"></A><BR><BR>"For not at seeming just, but being so
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>He aims; and from his depth of soil below
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>Harvests of wise and prudent counsels grow, the eyes of all the spectators 
<A NAME="114"></A>turned on Aristides, as if this virtue, in an especial manner, belonged 
<A NAME="115"></A>to him.
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR>He was a most determined champion for justice, not only against 
<A NAME="117"></A>feelings of friendship and favour, but wrath and malice. Thus it is reported 
<A NAME="118"></A>of him that when prosecuting the law against one who was his enemy, on 
<A NAME="119"></A>the judges after accusation refusing to hear the criminal, and proceeding 
<A NAME="120"></A>immediately to pass sentence upon him, he rose in haste from his seat and 
<A NAME="121"></A>joined in petition with him for a hearing, and that he might enjoy the 
<A NAME="122"></A>privilege of the law. Another time, when judging between two private persons, 
<A NAME="123"></A>on the one declaring his adversary had very much injured Aristides; "Tell 
<A NAME="124"></A>me rather, good friend," he said, "what wrong he has done you; for it is 
<A NAME="125"></A>your cause, not my own, which I now sit judge of." Being chosen to the 
<A NAME="126"></A>charge of the public revenue, he made it appear, that not only those of 
<A NAME="127"></A>his time, but the preceding officers, had alienated much treasure, and 
<A NAME="128"></A>especially Themistocles-
<A NAME="129"></A><BR><BR>"Well known he was an able man to be,
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>But with his fingers apt to be too free."
<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR>Therefore, Themistocles associating several persons against Aristides, 
<A NAME="132"></A>and impeaching him when he gave in his accounts, caused him to be condemned 
<A NAME="133"></A>of robbing the public; so Idomeneus states; but the best and chiefest men 
<A NAME="134"></A>of the city much resenting it, he was not only exempted from the fine imposed 
<A NAME="135"></A>upon him, but likewise again called to the same employment. Pretending 
<A NAME="136"></A>now to repent him of his former practice, and carrying himself with more 
<A NAME="137"></A>remissness, he became acceptable to such as pillaged the treasury by not 
<A NAME="138"></A>detecting or calling them to an exact account. So that those who had their 
<A NAME="139"></A>fill of the public money began highly to applaud Aristides, and sued to 
<A NAME="140"></A>the people making interest to have him once more chosen treasurer. But 
<A NAME="141"></A>when they were upon the point of election, he reproved the Athenians. "When 
<A NAME="142"></A>I discharged my office well and faithfully," said he, "I was insulted and 
<A NAME="143"></A>abused; but now that I have allowed the public thieves in a variety of 
<A NAME="144"></A>malpractices, I am considered an admirable patriot. I am more ashamed, 
<A NAME="145"></A>therefore, of this present honour than of the former sentence; and I commiserate 
<A NAME="146"></A>your condition, with whom it is more praiseworthy to oblige ill men than 
<A NAME="147"></A>to conserve the revenue of the public." Saying thus, and proceeding to 
<A NAME="148"></A>expose the thefts that had been committed, he stopped the mouths of those 
<A NAME="149"></A>who cried him up and vouched for him, but gained real and true commendations 
<A NAME="150"></A>from the best men.
<A NAME="151"></A><BR><BR>When Datis, being sent by Darius under pretence of punishing the 
<A NAME="152"></A>Athenians for their burning of Sardis, but in reality to reduce the Greeks 
<A NAME="153"></A>under his dominion, landed at Marathon and laid waste the country, among 
<A NAME="154"></A>the ten commanders appointed by the Athenians for the war, Miltiades was 
<A NAME="155"></A>of the greatest name; but the second place, both for reputation and power, 
<A NAME="156"></A>was possessed by Aristides; and when his opinion to join battle was added 
<A NAME="157"></A>to that of Miltiades, it did much to incline the balance. Every leader 
<A NAME="158"></A>by his day having the command in chief, when it came to Aristides's turn 
<A NAME="159"></A>he delivered it into the hands of Miltiades, showing his fellow-officers 
<A NAME="160"></A>that it is not dishonourable to obey and follow wise and able men, but, 
<A NAME="161"></A>on the contrary, noble and prudent. So appeasing their rivalry, and bringing 
<A NAME="162"></A>them to acquiesce in one and the best advice, he confirmed Miltiades in 
<A NAME="163"></A>the strength of an undivided and unmolested authority. For now every one, 
<A NAME="164"></A>yielding his day of command, looked for orders only to him. During the 
<A NAME="165"></A>fight the main body of the Athenians being the hardest put to it, the barbarians, 
<A NAME="166"></A>for a long time, making opposition there against the tribes Leontis and 
<A NAME="167"></A>Antiochis, Themistocles and Aristides being ranged together fought valiantly; 
<A NAME="168"></A>the one being of the tribe Leontis, the other of the Antiochis. But after 
<A NAME="169"></A>they had beaten the barbarians back to their ships, and perceived that 
<A NAME="170"></A>they sailed not for the isles, but were driven in by the force of sea and 
<A NAME="171"></A>wind towards the country of Attica, fearing lest they should take the city, 
<A NAME="172"></A>unprovided of defence, they hurried away thither with nine tribes, and 
<A NAME="173"></A>reached it the same day. Aristides, being left with his tribe at Marathon 
<A NAME="174"></A>to guard the plunder and prisoners, did not disappoint the opinion they 
<A NAME="175"></A>had of him. Amidst the profusion of gold and silver, all sorts of apparel, 
<A NAME="176"></A>and other property, more than can be mentioned, that were in the tents 
<A NAME="177"></A>and the vessels which they had taken, he neither felt the desire to meddle 
<A NAME="178"></A>with anything himself, nor suffered others to do it; unless it might be 
<A NAME="179"></A>some who took away anything unknown to him; as Callias, the torch-bearer, 
<A NAME="180"></A>did. One of the barbarians, it seems, prostrated himself before this man, 
<A NAME="181"></A>supposing him to be a king by his hair and fillet; and, when he had so 
<A NAME="182"></A>done, taking him by the hand, showed him a great quantity of gold hid in 
<A NAME="183"></A>a ditch. But Callias, most cruel and impious of men, took away the treasure, 
<A NAME="184"></A>but slew the man, lest he should tell of him. Hence, they say, the comic 
<A NAME="185"></A>poets gave his family the name of Laccopluti, or enriched by the ditch, 
<A NAME="186"></A>alluding to the place where Callias found the gold. Aristides, immediately 
<A NAME="187"></A>after this, was archon; although Demetrius, the Phalerian, says he held 
<A NAME="188"></A>the office a little before he died after the battle of Plataea. But in 
<A NAME="189"></A>the records of the successors of Xanthippides, in whose year Mardonius 
<A NAME="190"></A>was overthrown at Plataea, amongst very many there mentioned, there is 
<A NAME="191"></A>not so much as one of the same name as Aristides; while immediately after 
<A NAME="192"></A>Phaenippus, during whose term of office they obtained the victory of Marathon, 
<A NAME="193"></A>Aristides is registered.
<A NAME="194"></A><BR><BR>Of all his virtues, the common people were most affected with his 
<A NAME="195"></A>justice, because of its continual and common use; and thus, although of 
<A NAME="196"></A>mean fortune and ordinary birth, he possessed himself of the most kingly 
<A NAME="197"></A>and divine appellation of just: which kings, however, and tyrants have 
<A NAME="198"></A>never sought after; but have taken delight to be surnamed besiegers of 
<A NAME="199"></A>cities, thunderers, conquerors, or eagles again, and hawks; affecting, 
<A NAME="200"></A>it seems, the reputation which proceeds from power and violence, rather 
<A NAME="201"></A>than that of virtue. Although the divinity, to whom they desire to compare 
<A NAME="202"></A>and assimilate themselves, excels, it is supposed, in three things, immortality, 
<A NAME="203"></A>power, and virtue; of which three the noblest and divinest is virtue. For 
<A NAME="204"></A>the elements and vacuum have an everlasting existence; earthquakes, thunders, 
<A NAME="205"></A>storms, and torrents have great power; but in justice and equity nothing 
<A NAME="206"></A>participates except by means of reason and the knowledge of that which 
<A NAME="207"></A>is divine. And thus, taking the three varieties of feeling commonly entertained 
<A NAME="208"></A>towards the deity, the sense of his happiness, fear, and honour of him, 
<A NAME="209"></A>people would seem to think him blest and happy for his exemption from death 
<A NAME="210"></A>and corruption, to fear and dread him for his power and dominion, but to 
<A NAME="211"></A>love, honour, and adore him for his justice. Yet though thus disposed, 
<A NAME="212"></A>they covet that immortality which our nature is not capable of, and that 
<A NAME="213"></A>power the greatest part of which is at the disposal of fortune; but give 
<A NAME="214"></A>virtue, the only divine good really in our reach, the last place, most 
<A NAME="215"></A>unwisely; since justice makes the life of such as are in prosperity, power, 
<A NAME="216"></A>and authority the life of a god, and injustice turns it to that of a 
<A NAME="217"></A>beast.
<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR>Aristides, therefore, had at first the fortune to be beloved for 
<A NAME="219"></A>this surname, but at length envied. Especially when Themistocles spread 
<A NAME="220"></A>a rumour amongst the people that, by determining and judging all matters 
<A NAME="221"></A>privately, he had destroyed the courts of judicature, and was secretly 
<A NAME="222"></A>making way for a monarchy in his own person, without the assistance of 
<A NAME="223"></A>guards. Moreover the spirit of the people, now grown high, and confident 
<A NAME="224"></A>with their late victory, naturally entertained feelings of dislike to all 
<A NAME="225"></A>of more than common fame and reputation. Coming together, therefore, from 
<A NAME="226"></A>all parts into the city, they banished Aristides by the ostracism, giving 
<A NAME="227"></A>their jealousy of his reputation the name of fear of tyranny. For ostracism 
<A NAME="228"></A>was not the punishment of any criminal act, but was speciously said to 
<A NAME="229"></A>be the mere depression and humiliation of excessive greatness and power; 
<A NAME="230"></A>and was in fact a gentle relief and mitigation of envious feeling, which 
<A NAME="231"></A>was thus allowed to vent itself in inflicting no intolerable injury, only 
<A NAME="232"></A>a ten years' banishment. But after it came to be exercised upon base and 
<A NAME="233"></A>villainous fellows, they desisted from it; Hyperbolus being the last whom 
<A NAME="234"></A>they banished by the ostracism.
<A NAME="235"></A><BR><BR>The cause of Hyperbolus's banishment is said to have been this. 
<A NAME="236"></A>Alcibiades and Nicias, men that bore the greatest sway in the city, were 
<A NAME="237"></A>of different factions. As the people, therefore, were about to vote the 
<A NAME="238"></A>ostracism, and obviously to decree it against one of them consulting together 
<A NAME="239"></A>and uniting their parties they contrived the banishment of Hyperbolus. 
<A NAME="240"></A>Upon which the people, being offended, as if some contempt or affront was 
<A NAME="241"></A>put upon the thing left off and quite abolished it. It was performed, to 
<A NAME="242"></A>be short, in this manner. Every one taking an ostracon, a sherd, that is, 
<A NAME="243"></A>or piece of earthenware, wrote upon it the citizen's name he would have 
<A NAME="244"></A>banished, and carried it to a certain part of the market-place surrounded 
<A NAME="245"></A>with wooden rails. First, the magistrates numbered all the sherds in gross 
<A NAME="246"></A>(for if there were less than six thousand, the ostracism was imperfect); 
<A NAME="247"></A>then, laying every name by itself, they pronounced him whose name was written 
<A NAME="248"></A>by the larger number banished for ten years, with the enjoyment of his 
<A NAME="249"></A>estate. As therefore, they were writing the names on the sherds, it is 
<A NAME="250"></A>reported that an illiterate clownish fellow, giving Aristides his sherd, 
<A NAME="251"></A>supposing him a common citizen, begged him to write Aristides upon it; 
<A NAME="252"></A>and he being surprised and asking if Aristides had ever done him any injury, 
<A NAME="253"></A>"None at all," said he, "neither know I the man; but I am tired of hearing 
<A NAME="254"></A>him everywhere called the just." Aristides, hearing this, is said to have 
<A NAME="255"></A>made no reply, but returned the sherd with his own name inscribed. At his 
<A NAME="256"></A>departure from the city, lifting up his hands to heaven, he made a prayer 
<A NAME="257"></A>(the reverse, it would seem, of that of Achilles), that the Athenians might 
<A NAME="258"></A>never have any occasion which should constrain them to remember 
<A NAME="259"></A>Aristides.
<A NAME="260"></A><BR><BR>Nevertheless, three years after, when Xerxes marched through Thessaly 
<A NAME="261"></A>and Boeotia into the country of Attica, repealing the law, they decreed 
<A NAME="262"></A>the return of the banished: chiefly fearing Aristides, lest, joining himself 
<A NAME="263"></A>to the enemy, he should corrupt and bring over many of his fellow-citizens 
<A NAME="264"></A>to the party of the barbarians; much mistaking the man, who, already before 
<A NAME="265"></A>the decree, was exerting himself to excite and encourage the Greeks to 
<A NAME="266"></A>the defence of their liberty. And afterwards, when Themistocles was general 
<A NAME="267"></A>with absolute power, he assisted him in all ways both in action and counsel; 
<A NAME="268"></A>rendering, in consideration of the common security, the greatest enemy 
<A NAME="269"></A>he had the most glorious of men. For when Eurybiades was deliberating to 
<A NAME="270"></A>desert the isle of Salamis, and the galleys of the barbarians putting out 
<A NAME="271"></A>by night to sea surrounded and beset the narrow passage and islands, and 
<A NAME="272"></A>nobody was aware how they were environed, Aristides, with great hazard, 
<A NAME="273"></A>sailed from Aegina through the enemy's fleet; and coming by night to Themistocles's 
<A NAME="274"></A>tent and calling him out by himself; "if we have any discretion," said 
<A NAME="275"></A>he, "Themistocles, laying aside at this time our vain and childish contention, 
<A NAME="276"></A>let us enter upon a safe and honourable dispute, vying with each other 
<A NAME="277"></A>for the preservation of Greece; you in the ruling and commanding, I in 
<A NAME="278"></A>the subservient and advising part; even indeed, as I now understand you 
<A NAME="279"></A>to be alone adhering to the best advice, in counselling without any delay 
<A NAME="280"></A>to engage in the straits. And in this, though our own party oppose, the 
<A NAME="281"></A>enemy seems to assist you. For the sea behind, and all around us, is covered 
<A NAME="282"></A>with their fleet; so that we are under a necessity of approving ourselves 
<A NAME="283"></A>men of courage, and fighting whether we will or no; for there is no room 
<A NAME="284"></A>left us for flight." To which Themistocles answered, "I would not willingly, 
<A NAME="285"></A>Aristides, be overcome by you on this occasion; and shall endeavour, in 
<A NAME="286"></A>emulation of this good beginning, to outdo it in my actions." Also relating 
<A NAME="287"></A>to him the stratagem he had framed against the barbarians, he entreated 
<A NAME="288"></A>him to persuade Eurybiades and show him how it was impossible they should 
<A NAME="289"></A>save themselves without an engagement; as he was the more likely to be 
<A NAME="290"></A>believed. Whence, in the council of war, Cleocritus, the Corinthian, telling 
<A NAME="291"></A>Themistocles that Aristides did not like his advice as he was present and 
<A NAME="292"></A>said nothing, Aristides answered, That he should not have held his peace 
<A NAME="293"></A>if Themistocles had not been giving the best advice; and that he was now 
<A NAME="294"></A>silent not out of any good-will to the person, but in approbation of his 
<A NAME="295"></A>counsel.
<A NAME="296"></A><BR><BR>Thus the Greek captains were employed. But Aristides perceiving 
<A NAME="297"></A>Psyttalea, a small island that lies within the straits over against Salamis, 
<A NAME="298"></A>to be filled by a body of the enemy, put aboard his small boats the most 
<A NAME="299"></A>forward and courageous of his countrymen, and went ashore upon it; and, 
<A NAME="300"></A>joining battle with the barbarians, slew them all, except such more remarkable 
<A NAME="301"></A>persons as were taken alive. Amongst these were three children of Sandauce, 
<A NAME="302"></A>the king's sister, whom he immediately sent away to Themistocles, and it 
<A NAME="303"></A>is stated that, in accordance with a certain oracle, they were by the command 
<A NAME="304"></A>of Euphrantides, the seer, sacrificed to Bacchus, called Omestes, or the 
<A NAME="305"></A>devourer. But Aristides, placing armed men all around the island, lay in 
<A NAME="306"></A>wait for such as were cast upon it, to the intent that none of his friends 
<A NAME="307"></A>should perish, nor any of his enemies escape. For the closest engagement 
<A NAME="308"></A>of the ships, and the main fury of the whole battle, seems to been about 
<A NAME="309"></A>this place; for which reason a trophy was erected in 
<A NAME="310"></A>Psyttalea.
<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR>After the fight, Themistocles, to sound Aristides, told him they 
<A NAME="312"></A>had performed a good piece of service, but there was a better yet to be 
<A NAME="313"></A>done, the keeping Asia in Europe, by sailing forthwith to the Hellespont 
<A NAME="314"></A>and cutting in sunder the bridge. But Aristides, with an exclamation, bid 
<A NAME="315"></A>him think no more of it, but deliberate and find out means for removing 
<A NAME="316"></A>the Mede, as quickly as possible, out of Greece; lest being enclosed, through 
<A NAME="317"></A>want of means to escape, necessity should compel him to force his way with 
<A NAME="318"></A>so great an army. So Themistocles once more despatched Arnaces, the eunuch, 
<A NAME="319"></A>his prisoner, giving him in command privately to advertise the king that 
<A NAME="320"></A>he had diverted the Greeks from their intention of setting sail for the 
<A NAME="321"></A>bridges, out of the desire he felt to preserve him.
<A NAME="322"></A><BR><BR>Xerxes, being much terrified with this, immediately hasted to the 
<A NAME="323"></A>Hellespont. But Mardonius was left with the most serviceable part of the 
<A NAME="324"></A>army, about three hundred thousand men, and was a formidable enemy, confident 
<A NAME="325"></A>in his infantry and writing messages of defiance to the Greeks: "You have 
<A NAME="326"></A>overcome by sea men accustomed to fight on land, and unskilled at the oar; 
<A NAME="327"></A>but there lies now the open country of Thessaly; and the plains of Boeotia 
<A NAME="328"></A>offer a broad and worthy field for brave men, either horse or foot, to 
<A NAME="329"></A>contend in." But he sent privately to the Athenians, both by letter and 
<A NAME="330"></A>word of mouth from the king, promising to rebuild their city, to give them 
<A NAME="331"></A>a vast sum of money, and constitute them lords of all Greece, on condition 
<A NAME="332"></A>they were not engaged in the war. The Lacedaemonians, receiving news of 
<A NAME="333"></A>this, and fearing, despatched an embassy to the Athenians, entreating that 
<A NAME="334"></A>they would send their wives and children to Sparta, and receive support 
<A NAME="335"></A>from them for their superannuated. For, being despoiled both of their city 
<A NAME="336"></A>and country, the people were suffering extreme distress. Having given audience 
<A NAME="337"></A>to the ambassadors, they returned an answer, upon the motion of Aristides, 
<A NAME="338"></A>worthy of the highest admiration; declaring, that they forgave their enemies 
<A NAME="339"></A>if they thought all things purchasable by wealth, than which they knew 
<A NAME="340"></A>nothing of greater value; but that they felt offended at the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="341"></A>for looking only to their present poverty and exigence, without any remembrance 
<A NAME="342"></A>of their valour and magnanimity, offering them their victuals to fight 
<A NAME="343"></A>in the cause of Greece. Aristides, making this proposal and bringing back 
<A NAME="344"></A>the ambassadors into the assembly, charged them to tell the Lacedaemonians, 
<A NAME="345"></A>that all the treasure on the earth or under it was of less value with the 
<A NAME="346"></A>people of Athens than the liberty of Greece. And, showing the sun to those 
<A NAME="347"></A>who came from Mardonius, "As long as that retains the same course, so long," 
<A NAME="348"></A>said he, "shall the citizens of Athens wage war with the Persians for the 
<A NAME="349"></A>country which has been wasted, and the temples that have been profaned 
<A NAME="350"></A>and burnt by them." Moreover, he proposed a decree that the priests should 
<A NAME="351"></A>anathematize him who sent any herald to the Medes, or deserted the alliance 
<A NAME="352"></A>of Greece.
<A NAME="353"></A><BR><BR>When Mardonius made a second incursion into the country of Attica, 
<A NAME="354"></A>the people passed over again into the isle of Salamis. Aristides, being 
<A NAME="355"></A>sent to Lacedaemon, reproved them for their delay aid neglect in abandoning 
<A NAME="356"></A>Athens once more to the barbarians; and demanded their assistance for that 
<A NAME="357"></A>part of Greece which was not yet lost. The Ephori, hearing this, made show 
<A NAME="358"></A>of sporting all day, and of carelessly keeping holy day (for they were 
<A NAME="359"></A>then celebrating the Hyacinthian festival), but in the night, selecting 
<A NAME="360"></A>five thousand Spartans, each of whom was attended by seven Helots, they 
<A NAME="361"></A>sent them forth unknown to those from Athens. And when Aristides again 
<A NAME="362"></A>reprehended them, they told him in derision that he either doted or dreamed, 
<A NAME="363"></A>for the army was already at Oresteum, in their march towards the strangers, 
<A NAME="364"></A>as they called the Persians. Aristides answered that they jested unseasonably, 
<A NAME="365"></A>deluding their friends instead of their enemies. Thus says Idomeneus. But 
<A NAME="366"></A>in the decree of Aristides, not himself, but Cimon, Xanthippus, and Myronides 
<A NAME="367"></A>are appointed ambassadors.
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR>Being chosen general for the war, he repaired to Plataea with eight 
<A NAME="369"></A>thousand Athenians, where Pausanias, generalissimo of all Greece, joined 
<A NAME="370"></A>him with the Spartans; and the forces of the other Greeks came into them. 
<A NAME="371"></A>The whole encampment of the barbarians extended all along the bank of the 
<A NAME="372"></A>river Asopus, their numbers being so great there was no enclosing them 
<A NAME="373"></A>all, but their baggage and most valuable things were surrounded with a 
<A NAME="374"></A>square bulwark, each side of which was the length of ten 
<A NAME="375"></A>furlongs.
<A NAME="376"></A><BR><BR>Tisamenus, the Elean, had prophesied to Pausanias and all the Greeks, 
<A NAME="377"></A>and foretold them victory if they made no attempt upon the enemy, but stood 
<A NAME="378"></A>on their defence. But Aristides sending to Delphi, the god answered that 
<A NAME="379"></A>the Athenians should overcome their enemies in case they made supplication 
<A NAME="380"></A>to Jupiter and Juno of Cithaeron, Pan, and the nymphs Sphragitides, and 
<A NAME="381"></A>sacrificed to the heroes Androcrates, Leucon, Pisander, Damocrates, Hypsion, 
<A NAME="382"></A>Actaeon, and Polyidus; and if they fought within their own territories 
<A NAME="383"></A>in the plain of Ceres Eleusinia and Proserpine. Aristides was perplexed 
<A NAME="384"></A>upon the tidings of this oracle; since the heroes to whom it commanded 
<A NAME="385"></A>him to sacrifice had been chieftains of the Plataeans, and the cave of 
<A NAME="386"></A>the nymphs Sphragitides was on the top of Mount Cithaeron, on the side 
<A NAME="387"></A>facing the setting sun of summer time; in which place, as the story goes, 
<A NAME="388"></A>there was formerly an oracle, and many that lived in the district were 
<A NAME="389"></A>inspired with it, whom they called Nympholepti, possessed with the nymphs. 
<A NAME="390"></A>But the plain of Ceres Eleusinia, and the offer of victory to the Athenians, 
<A NAME="391"></A>if they fought in their own territories, recalled them again, and transferred 
<A NAME="392"></A>the war into the country of Attica. In this juncture, Arimnestus, who commanded 
<A NAME="393"></A>the Plataeans, dreamed that Jupiter, the Saviour, asked him what the Greeks 
<A NAME="394"></A>had resolved upon; and that he answered, "To-morrow, my Lord, we march 
<A NAME="395"></A>our army to Eleusis, and there give the barbarians battle according to 
<A NAME="396"></A>the directions of the oracle of Apollo." And that the god replied they 
<A NAME="397"></A>were utterly mistaken, for that the places spoken of by the oracle were 
<A NAME="398"></A>within the bounds of Plataea, and if they sought there they should find 
<A NAME="399"></A>them. This manifest vision having appeared to Arimnestus, when he awoke 
<A NAME="400"></A>he sent for the most aged and experienced of his countrymen, with whom, 
<A NAME="401"></A>communicating and examining the matter, he found that near Hysiae, at the 
<A NAME="402"></A>foot of Mount Cithaeron, there was a very ancient temple called the temple 
<A NAME="403"></A>of Ceres Eleusinia and Proserpine. He therefore forthwith took Aristides 
<A NAME="404"></A>to the place, which was very convenient for drawing up an army of foot, 
<A NAME="405"></A>because the slopes at the bottom of the mountain Cithaeron rendered the 
<A NAME="406"></A>plain, where it comes up to the temple, unfit for the movements of cavalry. 
<A NAME="407"></A>Also, in the same place, there was the fane of Androcrates, environed with 
<A NAME="408"></A>a thick shady grove. And that the oracle might be accomplished in all particulars 
<A NAME="409"></A>for the hope of victory, Arimnestus proposed, and the Plataeans decreed, 
<A NAME="410"></A>that the frontiers of their country towards Attica should be removed, and 
<A NAME="411"></A>the land given to the Athenians, that they might fight in defence of Greece 
<A NAME="412"></A>in their own proper territory. This zeal and liberality of the Plataeans 
<A NAME="413"></A>became so famous that Alexander, many years after, when he had obtained 
<A NAME="414"></A>the dominion of all Asia, upon erecting the walls of Plataea, caused proclamation 
<A NAME="415"></A>to be made, by the herald at the Olympic games, that the king did the Plataeans 
<A NAME="416"></A>this favour in consideration of their nobleness and magnanimity, because, 
<A NAME="417"></A>in the war with the Medes, they freely gave up their land and zealously 
<A NAME="418"></A>fought with the Greeks.
<A NAME="419"></A><BR><BR>The Tegeatans, contesting the post of honour with the Athenians, 
<A NAME="420"></A>demanded that, according to custom, the Lacedaemonians being ranged on 
<A NAME="421"></A>the right wing of the battle, they might have the left, alleging several 
<A NAME="422"></A>matters in commendation of their ancestors. The Athenians being indignant 
<A NAME="423"></A>at the claim, Aristides came forward: "To contend with the Tegeatans," 
<A NAME="424"></A>said he, "for noble descent and valour, the present time permits not; but 
<A NAME="425"></A>this we say to you, O you Spartans, and you the rest of the Greeks, that 
<A NAME="426"></A>place neither takes away nor contributes courage; we shall endeavour by 
<A NAME="427"></A>crediting and maintaining the post you assign us to reflect no dishonour 
<A NAME="428"></A>on our former performances. For we are come, not to differ with our friends, 
<A NAME="429"></A>but to fight our enemies; not to extol our ancestors, but ourselves to 
<A NAME="430"></A>behave as valiant men. This battle will manifest how much each city, captain, 
<A NAME="431"></A>and private soldier is worth to Greece." The council of war, upon this 
<A NAME="432"></A>address, decided for the Athenians, and gave them the other wing of the 
<A NAME="433"></A>battle.
<A NAME="434"></A><BR><BR>All Greece being in suspense, and especially the affairs of the 
<A NAME="435"></A>Athenians unsettled, certain persons of great families and possessions 
<A NAME="436"></A>having been impoverished by the war, and seeing all their authority and 
<A NAME="437"></A>reputation in the city vanished with their wealth, and others in possession 
<A NAME="438"></A>of their honours and places, convened privately at a house in Plataea, 
<A NAME="439"></A>and conspired for the dissolution of the democratic government; and, if 
<A NAME="440"></A>the plot should not succeed, to ruin the cause and betray all to the barbarians. 
<A NAME="441"></A>These matters being in agitation in the camp, and many persons already 
<A NAME="442"></A>corrupted, Aristides, perceiving the design, and dreading the present juncture 
<A NAME="443"></A>of time, determined neither to let the business pass unanimadverted upon, 
<A NAME="444"></A>nor yet altogether to expose it; not knowing how many the accusation might 
<A NAME="445"></A>reach, and willing to set bounds to his justice with a view to the public 
<A NAME="446"></A>convenience. Therefore, of many that were concerned, he apprehended eight 
<A NAME="447"></A>only, two of whom, who were first proceeded against and most guilty, Aeschines 
<A NAME="448"></A>of Lampra and Agesias of Acharnae, made their escape out of the camp. The 
<A NAME="449"></A>rest he dismissed; giving opportunity to such as thought themselves concealed 
<A NAME="450"></A>to take courage and repent; intimating that they had in the war a great 
<A NAME="451"></A>tribunal, where they might clear their guilt by manifesting their sincere 
<A NAME="452"></A>and good intentions towards their country.
<A NAME="453"></A><BR><BR>After this, Mardonius made trial of the Grecian courage, by sending 
<A NAME="454"></A>his whole number of horse, in which he thought himself much the stronger, 
<A NAME="455"></A>against them, while they were all pitched at the foot of Mount Cithaeron, 
<A NAME="456"></A>in strong and rocky places, except the Megarians. They, being three thousand 
<A NAME="457"></A>in number, were encamped on the plain, where they were damaged by the horse 
<A NAME="458"></A>charging and making inroads upon them on all hands. They sent, therefore, 
<A NAME="459"></A>in haste to Pausanias, demanding relief, as not being able alone to sustain 
<A NAME="460"></A>the great numbers of the barbarians. Pausanias, hearing this, and perceiving 
<A NAME="461"></A>the tents of the Megarians already hid by the multitude of darts and arrows, 
<A NAME="462"></A>and themselves driven together into a narrow space, was at a loss himself 
<A NAME="463"></A>how to aid them with his battalion of heavy-armed Lacedaemonians. He proposed 
<A NAME="464"></A>it, therefore, as a point of emulation in valour and love of distinction, 
<A NAME="465"></A>to the commanders and captains who were around him, if any would voluntarily 
<A NAME="466"></A>take upon them the defence and succour of the Megarians. The rest being 
<A NAME="467"></A>backward, Aristides undertook the enterprise for the Athenians, and sent 
<A NAME="468"></A>Olympiodorus, the most valiant of his inferior officers, with three hundred 
<A NAME="469"></A>chosen men and some archers under his command. These being soon in readiness, 
<A NAME="470"></A>and running upon the enemy, as soon as Masistius, who commanded the barbarians' 
<A NAME="471"></A>horse, a man of wonderful courage and of extraordinary bulk and comeliness 
<A NAME="472"></A>of person, perceived it, turning his steed he made towards them. And they 
<A NAME="473"></A>sustaining the shock and joining battle with him, there was a sharp conflict, 
<A NAME="474"></A>as though by this encounter they were to try the success of the whole war. 
<A NAME="475"></A>But after Masistius's horse received a wound and flung him, and he falling 
<A NAME="476"></A>could hardly raise himself through the weight of his armour, the Athenians, 
<A NAME="477"></A>pressing upon him with blows, could not easily get at his person, armed 
<A NAME="478"></A>as he was, his breast, his head, and his limbs all over, with gold and 
<A NAME="479"></A>brass and iron; but one of them at last, running him in at the visor of 
<A NAME="480"></A>his helmet, slew him; and the rest of the Persians, leaving the body, fled. 
<A NAME="481"></A>The greatness of the Greek success was known, not by the multitude of the 
<A NAME="482"></A>slain (for an inconsiderable number were killed), but by the sorrow the 
<A NAME="483"></A>barbarians expressed. For they shaved themselves, their horses, and mules 
<A NAME="484"></A>for the death of Masistius, and filled the plain with howling and lamentation; 
<A NAME="485"></A>having lost a person, who, next to Mardonius himself, was by many degrees 
<A NAME="486"></A>the chief among them, both for valour and authority.
<A NAME="487"></A><BR><BR>After this skirmish of the horse, they kept from fighting a long 
<A NAME="488"></A>time; for the soothsayers, by the sacrifices, foretold the victory both 
<A NAME="489"></A>to Greeks and Persians, if they stood upon the defensive part only, but 
<A NAME="490"></A>if they became aggressors, the contrary. At length Mardonius, when he had 
<A NAME="491"></A>but a few days' provision, and the Greek forces increased continually by 
<A NAME="492"></A>some or other that came in to them, impatient of delay, determined to lie 
<A NAME="493"></A>still no longer, but passing Asopus by daybreak, to fall unexpectedly upon 
<A NAME="494"></A>the Greeks; and signified the same over night to the captains of his host. 
<A NAME="495"></A>But about midnight, a certain horseman stole into the Greek camp, and coming 
<A NAME="496"></A>to the watch, desired them to call Aristides, the Athenian, to him. He 
<A NAME="497"></A>coming speedily, "I am," said the stranger, "Alexander, king of the Macedonians, 
<A NAME="498"></A>and am arrived here through the greatest danger in the world for the goodwill 
<A NAME="499"></A>I bear you, lest a sudden onset should dismay you, so as to behave in the 
<A NAME="500"></A>fight worse than usual. For to-morrow Mardonius will give you battle, urged, 
<A NAME="501"></A>not by any hope of success or courage, but by want of victuals; since, 
<A NAME="502"></A>indeed, the prophets prohibit him the battle, the sacrifices and oracles 
<A NAME="503"></A>being unfavourable; and the army is in despondency and consternation; but 
<A NAME="504"></A>necessity forces him to try his fortune, or sit still and endure the last 
<A NAME="505"></A>extremity of want." Alexander, thus saying, entreated Aristides to take 
<A NAME="506"></A>notice and remember him, but not to tell any other. But he told him, it 
<A NAME="507"></A>was not convenient to conceal the matter from Pausanias (because he was 
<A NAME="508"></A>general); as for any other, he would keep it secret from them till the 
<A NAME="509"></A>battle was fought; but if the Greeks obtained the victory, that then no 
<A NAME="510"></A>one should be ignorant of Alexander's good-will and kindness towards them. 
<A NAME="511"></A>After this, the king of the Macedonians rode back again, and Aristides 
<A NAME="512"></A>went to Pausanias's tent and told him they sent for the rest of the captains 
<A NAME="513"></A>and gave orders that the army should be in battle array.
<A NAME="514"></A><BR><BR>Here, according to Herodotus, Pausanias spoke to Aristides, desiring 
<A NAME="515"></A>him to transfer the Athenians to the right wing of the army opposite to 
<A NAME="516"></A>the Persians (as they would do better service against them, having been 
<A NAME="517"></A>experienced in their way of combat, and emboldened with former victories), 
<A NAME="518"></A>and to give him the left, where the Medizing Greeks were to make their 
<A NAME="519"></A>assault. The rest of the Athenian captains regarded this as an arrogant 
<A NAME="520"></A>and interfering act on the part of Pausanias; because, while permitting 
<A NAME="521"></A>the rest of the army to keep their stations, he removed them only from 
<A NAME="522"></A>place to place, like so many Helots, opposing them to the greatest strength 
<A NAME="523"></A>of the enemy. But Aristides said they were altogether in the wrong. If 
<A NAME="524"></A>so short a time ago they contested the left wing with the Tegeatans, and 
<A NAME="525"></A>gloried in being preferred before them, now, when the Lacedaemonians give 
<A NAME="526"></A>them place in the right, and yield them in a manner the leading of the 
<A NAME="527"></A>army, how is it they are discontented with the honour that is done them, 
<A NAME="528"></A>and do not look upon it as an advantage to have to fight, not against their 
<A NAME="529"></A>countrymen and kindred, but barbarians, and such as were by nature their 
<A NAME="530"></A>enemies? After this, the Athenians very readily changed places with the 
<A NAME="531"></A>Lacedaemonians, and there went words amongst them as they were encouraging 
<A NAME="532"></A>each other that the enemy approached with no better arms or stouter hearts 
<A NAME="533"></A>than those who fought the battle of Marathon; but had the same bows and 
<A NAME="534"></A>arrows, and the same embroidered coats and gold, and the same delicate 
<A NAME="535"></A>bodies and effeminate minds within; "While we have the same weapons and 
<A NAME="536"></A>bodies, and our courage augmented by our victories; and fight not like 
<A NAME="537"></A>others in defence of our country only, but for the trophies of Salamis 
<A NAME="538"></A>and Marathon; that they may not be looked upon as due to Miltiades or fortune, 
<A NAME="539"></A>but to the people of Athens." Thus, therefore, were they making haste to 
<A NAME="540"></A>change the order of their battle. But the Thebans, understanding it by 
<A NAME="541"></A>some deserters, forthwith acquainted Mardonius; and he, either for fear 
<A NAME="542"></A>of the Athenians, or a desire to engage the Lacedaemonians, marched over 
<A NAME="543"></A>his Persians to the other wing, and commanded the Greeks of his party to 
<A NAME="544"></A>be posted opposite to the Athenians. But this change was observed on the 
<A NAME="545"></A>other side, and Pausanias, wheeling about again, ranged himself on the 
<A NAME="546"></A>right, and Mardonius, also, as at first, took the left wing over against 
<A NAME="547"></A>the Lacedaemonians. So the day passed without action.
<A NAME="548"></A><BR><BR>After this the Greeks determined in council to remove their camp 
<A NAME="549"></A>some distance, to possess themselves of a place convenient for watering; 
<A NAME="550"></A>because the springs near them were polluted and destroyed by the barbarian 
<A NAME="551"></A>cavalry. But night being come, and the captains setting out towards the 
<A NAME="552"></A>place designed for their camping, the soldiers were not very ready to follow, 
<A NAME="553"></A>and keep in a body, but, as soon as they had quitted their first entrenchments, 
<A NAME="554"></A>made towards the city of Plataea; and there was much tumult and disorder 
<A NAME="555"></A>as they dispersed to various quarters and proceeded to pitch their tents. 
<A NAME="556"></A>The Lacedaemonians, against their will, had the fortune to be left by the 
<A NAME="557"></A>rest. For Amompharetus, a brave and daring man, who had long been burning 
<A NAME="558"></A>with desire of the fight, and resented their many lingerings and delays, 
<A NAME="559"></A>calling the removal of the camp a mere running away and flight, protested 
<A NAME="560"></A>he would not desert his post, but would there remain with his company and 
<A NAME="561"></A>sustain the charge of Mardonius. And when Pausanias came to him and told 
<A NAME="562"></A>him he did do these things by the common vote and determination of the 
<A NAME="563"></A>Greeks, Amompharetus taking up a great stone and flinging it at Pausanias' 
<A NAME="564"></A>feet, and "By this token," said he, "do I give my suffrage for the battle, 
<A NAME="565"></A>nor have I any concern with the cowardly consultations and decrees of other 
<A NAME="566"></A>men." Pausanias, not knowing what to do in the present juncture, sent to 
<A NAME="567"></A>the Athenians, who were drawing off, to stay to accompany him; and so he 
<A NAME="568"></A>himself set off with the rest of the army for Plataea, hoping thus to make 
<A NAME="569"></A>Amompharetus move.
<A NAME="570"></A><BR><BR>Meantime, day came upon them; and Mardonius (for he was not ignorant 
<A NAME="571"></A>of their deserting their camp), having his army in array, fell upon the 
<A NAME="572"></A>Lacedaemonians with great shouting and noise of barbarous people, as if 
<A NAME="573"></A>they were not about to join battle, but crush the Greeks in their flight. 
<A NAME="574"></A>Which within a very little came to pass. For Pausanias, perceiving what 
<A NAME="575"></A>was done, made a halt, and commanded every one to put themselves in order 
<A NAME="576"></A>for the battle; but either through his anger with Amompharetus, or the 
<A NAME="577"></A>disturbance he was in by reason of the sudden approach of the enemy, he 
<A NAME="578"></A>forgot to give the signal to the Greeks in general. Whence it was that 
<A NAME="579"></A>they did not come in immediately or in a body to their assistance, but 
<A NAME="580"></A>by small companies and straggling, when the fight was already begun. Pausanias, 
<A NAME="581"></A>offering sacrifice, could not procure favourable omens, and so commanded 
<A NAME="582"></A>the Lacedaemonians, setting down their shields at their feet, to abide 
<A NAME="583"></A>quietly and attend his directions, making no resistance to any of their 
<A NAME="584"></A>enemies. And he sacrificing again a second time, the horse charged, and 
<A NAME="585"></A>some of the Lacedaemonians were wounded. At this time, also, Callicrates, 
<A NAME="586"></A>who, we are told, was the most comely man in the army, being shot with 
<A NAME="587"></A>an arrow and upon the point of expiring, said that he lamented not his 
<A NAME="588"></A>death (for he came from home to lay down his life in the defence of Greece), 
<A NAME="589"></A>but that he died without action. The case was indeed hard, and the forbearance 
<A NAME="590"></A>of the men wonderful; for they let the enemy charge without repelling them; 
<A NAME="591"></A>and, expecting their proper opportunity from the gods and their general, 
<A NAME="592"></A>suffered themselves to be wounded and slain in their ranks. And some say, 
<A NAME="593"></A>that while Pausanias was at sacrifice and prayers, some space out of the 
<A NAME="594"></A>battle array, certain Lydians, falling suddenly upon him, plundered and 
<A NAME="595"></A>scattered the sacrifice: and that Pausanias and his company, having no 
<A NAME="596"></A>arms, beat them with staves and whips; and that, in imitation of this attack, 
<A NAME="597"></A>the whipping the boys about the altar, and after it the Lydian procession, 
<A NAME="598"></A>are to this day practised in Sparta.
<A NAME="599"></A><BR><BR>Pausanias, therefore, being troubled at these things, while the 
<A NAME="600"></A>priests went on offering one sacrifice after another, turns himself towards 
<A NAME="601"></A>the temple with tears in his eyes, and lifting up his hands to heaven besought 
<A NAME="602"></A>Juno of Cithaeron, and the other tutelar gods of the Plataeans, if it were 
<A NAME="603"></A>not in the fates for the Greeks to obtain the victory, that they might 
<A NAME="604"></A>not perish without performing some remarkable thing, and by their actions 
<A NAME="605"></A>demonstrating to their enemies that they waged war with men of courage 
<A NAME="606"></A>and soldiers. While Pausanias was thus in the act of supplication, the 
<A NAME="607"></A>sacrifices appeared propitious, and the soothsayers foretold victory. The 
<A NAME="608"></A>word being given, the Lacedaemonian battalion of foot seemed, on the sudden, 
<A NAME="609"></A>like some one fierce animal, setting up his bristles, and betaking himself 
<A NAME="610"></A>to the combat; and the barbarians perceived that they encountered with 
<A NAME="611"></A>men who would fight it to the death. Therefore, holding their wicker-shields 
<A NAME="612"></A>before them, they shot their arrows amongst the Lacedaemonians. But they, 
<A NAME="613"></A>keeping together in the order of a phalanx, and falling upon the enemies, 
<A NAME="614"></A>forced their shields out of their hands, and, striking with their pikes 
<A NAME="615"></A>at the breasts and faces of the Persians, overthrew many of them, who, 
<A NAME="616"></A>however, fell not either unrevenged or without courage. For taking hold 
<A NAME="617"></A>of the spears with their bare hands, they broke many of them, and betook 
<A NAME="618"></A>themselves not without effect to the sword; and making use of their falchions 
<A NAME="619"></A>and scimitars, and wresting the Lacedaemonians' shields from them, and 
<A NAME="620"></A>grappling with them, it was a long time that they made 
<A NAME="621"></A>resistance.
<A NAME="622"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile, for some time, the Athenians stood still, waiting for 
<A NAME="623"></A>the Lacedaemonians to come up. But when they heard much noise as of men 
<A NAME="624"></A>engaged in fight, and a messenger, they say, came from Pausanias, to advertise 
<A NAME="625"></A>them of what was going on, they soon hasted to their assistance. And as 
<A NAME="626"></A>they passed through the plain to the place where the noise was, the Greeks, 
<A NAME="627"></A>who took part with the enemy, came upon them. Aristides, as soon as he 
<A NAME="628"></A>saw them, going a considerable space before the rest, cried out to them, 
<A NAME="629"></A>conjuring them by the guardian gods of Greece to forbear the fight, and 
<A NAME="630"></A>be no impediment or stop to those who were going to succour the defenders 
<A NAME="631"></A>of Greece. But when he perceived they gave no attention to him, and had 
<A NAME="632"></A>prepared themselves for the battle, then turning from the present relief 
<A NAME="633"></A>of the Lacedaemonians, he engaged them, being five thousand in number. 
<A NAME="634"></A>But the greatest part soon gave way and retreated, as the barbarians also 
<A NAME="635"></A>were put to flight. The sharpest conflict is said to have been against 
<A NAME="636"></A>the Thebans, the chiefest and most powerful persons among them at that 
<A NAME="637"></A>time siding zealously with the Medes, and leading the multitude not according 
<A NAME="638"></A>to their own inclination, but as being subjects of an 
<A NAME="639"></A>oligarchy.
<A NAME="640"></A><BR><BR>The battle being thus divided, the Lacedaemonians first beat off 
<A NAME="641"></A>the Persians; and a Spartan, named Arimnestus, slew Mardonius by a blow 
<A NAME="642"></A>on the head with a stone, as the oracle in the temple of Amphiaraus had 
<A NAME="643"></A>foretold to him. For Mardonius sent a Lydian thither, and another person, 
<A NAME="644"></A>a Carian, to the cave of Trophonius. This latter the priest of the oracle 
<A NAME="645"></A>answered in his own language. But the Lydian sleeping in the temple of 
<A NAME="646"></A>Amphiaraus, it seemed to him that a minister of the divinity stood before 
<A NAME="647"></A>him and commanded him to be gone; and on his refusing to do it, flung a 
<A NAME="648"></A>great stone at his head, so that he thought himself slain with the blow. 
<A NAME="649"></A>Such is the story. -They drove the fliers within their walls of wood; and, 
<A NAME="650"></A>a little time after, the Athenians put the Thebans to flight, killing three 
<A NAME="651"></A>hundred of the chiefest and of greatest note among them in the actual fight 
<A NAME="652"></A>itself. For when they began to fly, news came that the army of the barbarians 
<A NAME="653"></A>was besieged within their palisade; and so giving the Greeks opportunity 
<A NAME="654"></A>to save themselves, they marched to assist at the fortifications; and coming 
<A NAME="655"></A>in to the Lacedaemonians, who were altogether unhandy and unexperienced 
<A NAME="656"></A>in storming, they took the camp with great slaughter of the enemy. For 
<A NAME="657"></A>of three hundred thousand, forty thousand only are said to have escaped 
<A NAME="658"></A>with Artabazus; while on the Greeks' side there perished in all thirteen 
<A NAME="659"></A>hundred and sixty; of which fifty-two were Athenians, all of the tribe 
<A NAME="660"></A>Aeantis, that fought, says Clidemus, with the greatest courage of any; 
<A NAME="661"></A>and for this reason the men of this tribe used to offer sacrifice for the 
<A NAME="662"></A>victory, as enjoined by the oracle, to the nymphs Sphragitides at the expense 
<A NAME="663"></A>of the public; ninety-one were Lacedaemonians, and sixteen Tegeatans. It 
<A NAME="664"></A>is strange, therefore, upon what grounds Herodotus can say, that they only, 
<A NAME="665"></A>and none other, encountered the enemy, for the number of the slain and 
<A NAME="666"></A>their monuments testify that the victory was obtained by all in general; 
<A NAME="667"></A>and if the rest had been standing still, while the inhabitants of three 
<A NAME="668"></A>cities only had been engaged in the fight, they would not have set on the 
<A NAME="669"></A>altar the inscription-
<A NAME="670"></A><BR><BR>"The Greeks, when, by their courage and their 
<A NAME="671"></A>might,
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>They had repelled the Persian in the fight,
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>The common altar of freed Greece to be,
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>Reared this to Jupiter who guards the free."
<A NAME="675"></A><BR><BR>They fought this battle on the fourth day of the month Boedromion, 
<A NAME="676"></A>according to the Athenians, but according to the Boeotians, on the twenty-seventh 
<A NAME="677"></A>of Panemus;- on which day there is still a convention of the Greeks at 
<A NAME="678"></A>Plataea, and the Plataeans still offer sacrifice for the victory to Jupiter 
<A NAME="679"></A>of freedom. As for the difference of days, it is not to be wondered at, 
<A NAME="680"></A>since even at the present time, when there is a far more accurate knowledge 
<A NAME="681"></A>of astronomy, some begin the month at one time, and some at 
<A NAME="682"></A>another.
<A NAME="683"></A><BR><BR>After this, the Athenians not yielding the honour of the day to 
<A NAME="684"></A>the Lacedaemonians, nor consenting they should erect a trophy, things were 
<A NAME="685"></A>not far from being ruined by dissension among the armed Greeks; had not 
<A NAME="686"></A>Aristides, by much soothing and counselling the commanders, especially 
<A NAME="687"></A>Leocrates and Myronides, pacified and persuaded them to leave the thing 
<A NAME="688"></A>to the decision of the Greeks. And on their proceeding to discuss the matter, 
<A NAME="689"></A>Theogiton, the Megarian, declared the honour of the victory was to be given 
<A NAME="690"></A>some other city, if they would prevent a civil war; after him Cleocritus 
<A NAME="691"></A>of Corinth rising up, made people think he would ask the palm for the Corinthians 
<A NAME="692"></A>(for next to Sparta and Athens, Corinth was in greatest estimation); but 
<A NAME="693"></A>he delivered his opinion, to the general admiration, in favour of the Plataeans; 
<A NAME="694"></A>and counselled to take away all contention by giving them the reward and 
<A NAME="695"></A>glory of the victory, whose being honoured could be distasteful to neither 
<A NAME="696"></A>party. This being said, first Aristides gave consent in the name of the 
<A NAME="697"></A>Athenians, and Pausanias, then, for the Lacedaemonians. So, being reconciled, 
<A NAME="698"></A>they set apart eighty talents for the Plataeans, with which they built 
<A NAME="699"></A>the temple and dedicated the image to Minerva, and adorned the temple with 
<A NAME="700"></A>pictures, which even to this very day retain their lustre. But the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="701"></A>and Athenians each erected a trophy apart by themselves. On their consulting 
<A NAME="702"></A>the oracle about offering sacrifice, Apollo answered that they should dedicate 
<A NAME="703"></A>an altar to Jupiter of freedom, but should not sacrifice till they had 
<A NAME="704"></A>extinguished the fires throughout the country, as having been defiled by 
<A NAME="705"></A>the barbarians, and had kindled unpolluted fire at the common altar at 
<A NAME="706"></A>Delphi. The magistrates of Greece, therefore, went forthwith and compelled 
<A NAME="707"></A>such as had fire to put it out; and Euchidas, a Plataean, promising to 
<A NAME="708"></A>fetch fire, with all possible speed, from the altar of the god, went to 
<A NAME="709"></A>Delphi, and having sprinkled and purified his body crowned himself with 
<A NAME="710"></A>laurel; and taking the fire from the altar ran back to Plataea, and got 
<A NAME="711"></A>back there before sunset, performing in one day a journey of a thousand 
<A NAME="712"></A>furlongs; and saluting his fellow-citizens and delivering them the fire, 
<A NAME="713"></A>he immediately fell down, and in a short time after expired. But the Plataeans, 
<A NAME="714"></A>taking him up, interred him in the temple of Diana Euclia, setting this 
<A NAME="715"></A>inscription over him: "Euchidas ran to Delphi and back again in one day." 
<A NAME="716"></A>Most people believe that Euclia is Diana, and call her by that name. But 
<A NAME="717"></A>some say she was the daughter of Hercules, by Myrto, the daughter of Menoetius, 
<A NAME="718"></A>and sister of Patroclus, and dying a virgin, was worshipped by the Boeotians 
<A NAME="719"></A>and Locrians. Her altar and image are set up in all their market-places, 
<A NAME="720"></A>and those of both sexes that are about marrying sacrifice to her before 
<A NAME="721"></A>the nuptials.
<A NAME="722"></A><BR><BR>A general assembly of all the Greeks being called, Aristides proposed 
<A NAME="723"></A>a decree that the deputies and religious representatives of the Greek states 
<A NAME="724"></A>should assemble annually at Plataea, and every fifth year celebrate the 
<A NAME="725"></A>Eleutheria or games of freedom. And that there should be a levy upon all 
<A NAME="726"></A>Greece for the war against the barbarians of ten thousand spearmen, one 
<A NAME="727"></A>thousand horse, and a hundred sail of ships; but the Plataeans to be exempt, 
<A NAME="728"></A>and sacred to the service of the gods, offering sacrifice for the welfare 
<A NAME="729"></A>of Greece. These things being ratified, the Plataeans undertook the performance 
<A NAME="730"></A>of annual sacrifice to such as were slain and buried in that place; which 
<A NAME="731"></A>they still perform in the following manner. On the sixteenth day of Maemacterion 
<A NAME="732"></A>(which with the Boeotians is Alalcomenus) they make their procession, which, 
<A NAME="733"></A>beginning by break of day, is led by a trumpeter sounding for onset; then 
<A NAME="734"></A>follow certain chariots loaded with myrrh and garlands; and then a black 
<A NAME="735"></A>bull; then come the young men of free birth carrying libations of wine 
<A NAME="736"></A>and milk in large two-handed vessels, and jars of oil and precious ointments, 
<A NAME="737"></A>none of servile condition being permitted to have any hand in this ministration, 
<A NAME="738"></A>because the men died in defence of freedom; after all comes the chief magistrate 
<A NAME="739"></A>of Plataea (for whom it is unlawful at other times either to touch iron 
<A NAME="740"></A>or wear any other coloured garment but white), at that time apparelled 
<A NAME="741"></A>in a purple robe; and, taking a water-pot out of the city record-office, 
<A NAME="742"></A>he proceeds, bearing a sword in his hand, through the middle of the town 
<A NAME="743"></A>to the sepulchres. Then drawing water out of a spring, he washes and anoints 
<A NAME="744"></A>the monuments, and sacrificing the bull upon a pile of wood, and making 
<A NAME="745"></A>supplication to Jupiter and Mercury of the earth, invites those valiant 
<A NAME="746"></A>men who perished in the defence of Greece to the banquet and the libations 
<A NAME="747"></A>of blood. After this, mixing a bowl of wine, and pouring out for himself, 
<A NAME="748"></A>he says, "I drink to those who lost their lives for the liberty of Greece." 
<A NAME="749"></A>These solemnities the Plataeans observe to this day.
<A NAME="750"></A><BR><BR>Aristides perceived that the Athenians, after their return into 
<A NAME="751"></A>the city, were eager for a democracy; and deeming the people to deserve 
<A NAME="752"></A>consideration on account of their valiant behaviour, as also that it was 
<A NAME="753"></A>a matter of difficulty, they being well armed, powerful, and full of spirit 
<A NAME="754"></A>with their victories, to oppose them by force, he brought forward a decree 
<A NAME="755"></A>that every one might share in the government and the archons be chosen 
<A NAME="756"></A>out of the whole body of the Athenians. And on Themistocles telling the 
<A NAME="757"></A>people in assembly that he had some advice for them, which could not be 
<A NAME="758"></A>given in public, but was most important for the advantage and security 
<A NAME="759"></A>of the city, they appointed Aristides alone to hear and consider it with 
<A NAME="760"></A>him. And on his acquainting Aristides that his intent was to set fire to 
<A NAME="761"></A>the arsenal of the Greeks, for by that means should the Athenians become 
<A NAME="762"></A>supreme masters of all Greece, Aristides, returning to the assembly, told 
<A NAME="763"></A>them that nothing was more advantageous than what Themistocles designed, 
<A NAME="764"></A>and nothing more unjust. The Athenians, hearing this, gave Themistocles 
<A NAME="765"></A>order to desist; such was the love of justice felt by the people, and such 
<A NAME="766"></A>the credit and confidence they reposed in Aristides.
<A NAME="767"></A><BR><BR>Being sent in joint commission with Cimon to the war, he took notice 
<A NAME="768"></A>that Pausanias and the other Spartan captains made themselves offensive 
<A NAME="769"></A>by imperiousness and harshness to the confederates; and by being himself 
<A NAME="770"></A>gentle and considerate with them, and by the courtesy and disinterested 
<A NAME="771"></A>temper which Cimon, after his example, manifested in the expeditions, he 
<A NAME="772"></A>stole away the chief command from the Lacedaemonians, neither by weapons, 
<A NAME="773"></A>ships, or horses, but by equity and wise policy. For the Athenians being 
<A NAME="774"></A>endeared to the Greeks by the justice of Aristides and by Cimon's moderation, 
<A NAME="775"></A>the tyranny and selfishness of Pausanias rendered them yet more desirable. 
<A NAME="776"></A>He on all occasions treated the commanders of the confederates haughtily 
<A NAME="777"></A>and roughly; and the common soldiers he punished with stripes, or standing 
<A NAME="778"></A>under the iron anchor for a whole day together; neither was it permitted 
<A NAME="779"></A>for any to provide straw for themselves to lie on, or forage for their 
<A NAME="780"></A>horses, or to come near the springs to water before the Spartans were furnished, 
<A NAME="781"></A>but servants with whips drove away such as approached. And when Aristides 
<A NAME="782"></A>once was about to complain and expostulate with Pausanias, he told him 
<A NAME="783"></A>with an angry look that he was not at leisure, and gave no attention to 
<A NAME="784"></A>him. The consequence was that the sea captains and generals of the Greeks, 
<A NAME="785"></A>in particular, the Chians, Samians, and Lesbians, came to Aristides and 
<A NAME="786"></A>requested him to be their general, and to receive the confederates into 
<A NAME="787"></A>his command, who had long desired to relinquish the Spartans and come over 
<A NAME="788"></A>to the Athenians. But he answered that he saw both equity and necessity 
<A NAME="789"></A>in what they said, but their fidelity required the test of some action, 
<A NAME="790"></A>the commission of which would make it impossible for the multitude to change 
<A NAME="791"></A>their minds again. Upon which Uliades, the Samian, and Antagoras of Chios, 
<A NAME="792"></A>conspiring together, ran in near Byzantium on Pausanias's galley, getting 
<A NAME="793"></A>her between them as she was sailing before the rest. But when Pausanias, 
<A NAME="794"></A>beholding them, arose up and furiously threatened soon to make them know 
<A NAME="795"></A>that they had been endangering not his galley, but their own countries, 
<A NAME="796"></A>they bid him go his way, and thank Fortune that fought for him at Plataea; 
<A NAME="797"></A>for hitherto, in reverence to that, the Greeks had forborne from inflicting 
<A NAME="798"></A>on him the punishment he deserved. In fine, they all went off and joined 
<A NAME="799"></A>the Athenians. And here the magnanimity of the Lacedaemonians was wonderful. 
<A NAME="800"></A>For when they perceived that their generals were becoming corrupted by 
<A NAME="801"></A>the greatness of their authority, they voluntarily laid down the chief 
<A NAME="802"></A>command, and left off sending any more of them to the wars, choosing rather 
<A NAME="803"></A>to have citizens of moderation and consistent in the observance of their 
<A NAME="804"></A>customs, than to possess the dominion of all Greece.
<A NAME="805"></A><BR><BR>Even during the command of the Lacedaemonians, the Greeks paid 
<A NAME="806"></A>a certain contribution towards the maintenance of the war; and being desirous 
<A NAME="807"></A>to be rated city by city in their due proportion, they desired Aristides 
<A NAME="808"></A>of the Athenians, and gave him command, surveying the country and revenue, 
<A NAME="809"></A>to assess every one according to their ability and what they were worth. 
<A NAME="810"></A>But he, being so largely empowered, Greece as it were submitting all her 
<A NAME="811"></A>affairs to his sole management, went out poor and returned poorer; laying 
<A NAME="812"></A>the tax not only without corruption and injustice, but to the satisfaction 
<A NAME="813"></A>and convenience of all. For as the ancients celebrated the age of Saturn, 
<A NAME="814"></A>so did the confederates of Athens Aristides's taxation, terming it the 
<A NAME="815"></A>happy time of Greece; and that more especially, as the sum was in a short 
<A NAME="816"></A>time doubled, and afterwards trebled. For the assessment which Aristides 
<A NAME="817"></A>made was four hundred and sixty talents. But to this Pericles added very 
<A NAME="818"></A>near one third part more; for Thucydides says that in the beginning of 
<A NAME="819"></A>the Peloponnesian war the Athenians had coming in from their confederates 
<A NAME="820"></A>six hundred talents. But after Pericles's death. the demagogues, increasing 
<A NAME="821"></A>by little and little, raised it to the sum of thirteen hundred talents; 
<A NAME="822"></A>not so much through the war's being so expensive and changeable either 
<A NAME="823"></A>by its length or ill success, as by their alluring the people to spend 
<A NAME="824"></A>upon largesses and playhouse allowances, and in erecting statues and temples. 
<A NAME="825"></A>Aristides, therefore, having acquired a wonderful and great reputation 
<A NAME="826"></A>by this levy of the tribute, Themistocles is said to have derided him, 
<A NAME="827"></A>as if this had been not the commendation of a man, but a money-bag; a retaliation, 
<A NAME="828"></A>though not in the same kind for some free words which Aristides had used. 
<A NAME="829"></A>For he, when Themistocles once was saying that he thought the highest virtue 
<A NAME="830"></A>of a general was to understand and foreknow the measures the enemy would 
<A NAME="831"></A>take, replied, "This, indeed, Themistocles, is simply necessary, but the 
<A NAME="832"></A>excellent thing in a general is to keep his hands from taking 
<A NAME="833"></A>money."
<A NAME="834"></A><BR><BR>Aristides, moreover, made all the people of Greece swear to keep 
<A NAME="835"></A>the league, and himself took the oath in the name of the Athenians, flinging 
<A NAME="836"></A>wedges of red-hot iron into the sea, after curses against such as should 
<A NAME="837"></A>make breach of their vow. But afterwards, it would seem, when things were 
<A NAME="838"></A>in such a state as constrained them to govern with a stronger hand, he 
<A NAME="839"></A>bade the Athenians to throw the perjury upon him, and manage affairs as 
<A NAME="840"></A>convenience required. And, in general, Theophrastus tells us, that Aristides 
<A NAME="841"></A>was, in his own private affairs, and those of his fellow-citizens, rigorously 
<A NAME="842"></A>just, but that in public matters he acted often in accordance with his 
<A NAME="843"></A>country's policy, which demanded, sometimes, not a little injustice. It 
<A NAME="844"></A>is reported of him that he said in a debate, upon the motion of the Samians 
<A NAME="845"></A>for removing the treasure from Delos to Athens, contrary to the league, 
<A NAME="846"></A>that the thing indeed was not just but was expedient.
<A NAME="847"></A><BR><BR>In fine, having established the dominion of his city over so many 
<A NAME="848"></A>people, he himself remained indigent; and always delighted as much in the 
<A NAME="849"></A>glory of being poor, as in that of his trophies; as is evident from the 
<A NAME="850"></A>following story. Callias, the torch-bearer, was related to him; and was 
<A NAME="851"></A>prosecuted by his enemies in a capital cause, in which, after they had 
<A NAME="852"></A>slightly argued the matters on which they indicted him, they proceeded, 
<A NAME="853"></A>besides the point, to address the judges: "You know," said they, "Aristides, 
<A NAME="854"></A>the son of Lysimachus, who is the admiration of all Greece. In what a condition 
<A NAME="855"></A>do you think his family is in at his house, when you see him appear in 
<A NAME="856"></A>public in such a threadbare cloak? Is it not probable that one who, out 
<A NAME="857"></A>of doors, goes thus exposed to the cold, must want food and other necessaries 
<A NAME="858"></A>at home? Callias, the wealthiest of the Athenians, does nothing to relieve 
<A NAME="859"></A>either him or his wife and children in their poverty, though he is his 
<A NAME="860"></A>own cousin, and has made use of him in many cases, and often reaped advantage 
<A NAME="861"></A>by his interest with you." But Callias, perceiving the judges were moved 
<A NAME="862"></A>more particularly by this, and were exasperated against him, called in 
<A NAME="863"></A>Aristides, requiring him to testify that when he frequently offered him 
<A NAME="864"></A>divers presents, and entreated him to accept them, he had refused, answering 
<A NAME="865"></A>that it became him better to be proud of his poverty than Callias of his 
<A NAME="866"></A>wealth; since there are many to be seen that make a good or bad use of 
<A NAME="867"></A>riches, but it is difficult, comparatively, to meet with one who supports 
<A NAME="868"></A>poverty in a noble spirit; those only should be ashamed of it who incurred 
<A NAME="869"></A>it against their wills. On Aristides deposing these facts in favour of 
<A NAME="870"></A>Callias, there was none who heard them that went not away desirous rather 
<A NAME="871"></A>to be poor like Aristides than rich as Callias. Thus Aeschines, the scholar 
<A NAME="872"></A>of Socrates, writes. But Plato declares that, of all the great renowned 
<A NAME="873"></A>men in the city of Athens, he was the only one worthy of consideration; 
<A NAME="874"></A>for Themistocles, Cimon, and Pericles filled the city with porticoes, treasure, 
<A NAME="875"></A>and many other vain things, but Aristides guided his public life by the 
<A NAME="876"></A>rule of justice. He showed his moderation very plainly in his conduct towards 
<A NAME="877"></A>Themistocles himself. For though Themistocles had been his adversary in 
<A NAME="878"></A>all his undertakings, and was the cause of his banishment, yet when he 
<A NAME="879"></A>afforded a similar opportunity of revenge, being accused to the city, Aristides 
<A NAME="880"></A>bore him no malice; but while Alcmaeon, Cimon, and many others were prosecuting 
<A NAME="881"></A>and impeaching him, Aristides alone neither did nor said any ill against 
<A NAME="882"></A>him, and no more triumphed over his enemy in his adversity than he had 
<A NAME="883"></A>envied him his prosperity.
<A NAME="884"></A><BR><BR>Some say Aristides died in Pontus, during a voyage upon the affairs 
<A NAME="885"></A>of the public. Others that he died of old age at Athens being in great 
<A NAME="886"></A>honour and veneration amongst his fellow-citizens. But Craterus, the Macedonian, 
<A NAME="887"></A>relates his death as follows. After the banishment of Themistocles, he 
<A NAME="888"></A>says, the people growing insolent, there sprung up a number of false and 
<A NAME="889"></A>frivolous accusers, impeaching the best and most influential men and exposing 
<A NAME="890"></A>them to the envy of the multitude, whom their good fortune and power had 
<A NAME="891"></A>filled with self-conceit. Amongst these, Aristides was condemned of bribery 
<A NAME="892"></A>upon the accusation of Diophantus of Amphitrope, for taking money from 
<A NAME="893"></A>the Ionians when he was collector of the tribute; and being unable to pay 
<A NAME="894"></A>the fine, which was fifty minae, sailed to Ionia, and died there. But of 
<A NAME="895"></A>this Craterus brings no written proof, neither the sentence of his condemnation, 
<A NAME="896"></A>nor the decree of the people; though in general it is tolerably usual with 
<A NAME="897"></A>him to set down such things and to cite his authors. Almost all others 
<A NAME="898"></A>who have spoken of the misdeeds of the people towards their generals collect 
<A NAME="899"></A>them all together, and tell us of the banishment of Themistocles, Miltiades's 
<A NAME="900"></A>bonds, Pericles's fine, and the death of Paches in the judgment-hall, who, 
<A NAME="901"></A>upon receiving sentence, killed himself on the hustings, with many things 
<A NAME="902"></A>of the like nature. They add the banishment of Aristides; but of this his 
<A NAME="903"></A>condemnation they make no mention.
<A NAME="904"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, his monument is to be seen at Phalerum, which they say 
<A NAME="905"></A>was built him by the city, he not having left enough even to defray funeral 
<A NAME="906"></A>charges. And it is stated that his two daughters were publicly married 
<A NAME="907"></A>out of the prytaneum, or state-house, by the city, which decreed each of 
<A NAME="908"></A>them three thousand drachmas for her portion; and that upon his son Lysimachus 
<A NAME="909"></A>the people bestowed a hundred minas of money, and as many acres of planted 
<A NAME="910"></A>land, and ordered him besides, upon the motion of Alcibiades, four drachmas 
<A NAME="911"></A>a day. Furthermore, Lysimachus leaving a daughter, named Polycrite, as 
<A NAME="912"></A>Callisthenes says, the people voted her, also, the same allowance for food 
<A NAME="913"></A>with those that obtained the victory in the Olympic Games. But Demetrius 
<A NAME="914"></A>the Phalerian, Hieronymus the Rhodian, Aristoxenus the musician, and Aristotle 
<A NAME="915"></A>(if the Treatise of Nobility is to be reckoned among the genuine pieces 
<A NAME="916"></A>of Aristotle) say that Myrto, Aristides's granddaughter, lived with Socrates 
<A NAME="917"></A>the philosopher, who indeed had another wife, but took her into his house, 
<A NAME="918"></A>being a widow, by reason of her indigence and want of the necessaries of 
<A NAME="919"></A>life. But Panaetius sufficiently confutes this in his book concerning Socrates. 
<A NAME="920"></A>Demetrius the Phalerian, in his Socrates, says he knew one Lysimachus, 
<A NAME="921"></A>son to the daughter of Aristides, extremely poor, who used to sit near 
<A NAME="922"></A>what is called the Iaccheum, and sustained himself by a table for interpreting 
<A NAME="923"></A>dreams; and that, upon his proposal and representations, a decree was passed 
<A NAME="924"></A>by the people to give the mother and aunt of this man half a drachma a 
<A NAME="925"></A>day. The same Demetrius, when he was legislating himself, decreed each 
<A NAME="926"></A>of these women a drachma per diem. And it is not to be wondered at, that 
<A NAME="927"></A>the people of Athens should take such care of people living in the city, 
<A NAME="928"></A>since hearing the granddaughter of Aristogiton was in a low condition in 
<A NAME="929"></A>the isle of Lemnos, and so poor nobody would marry her, they brought her 
<A NAME="930"></A>back to Athens, and marrying her to a man of good birth, gave a farm at 
<A NAME="931"></A>Potamus as her marriage-portion; and of similar humanity and bounty the 
<A NAME="932"></A>city of Athens, even in our age, has given numerous proofs, and is justly 
<A NAME="933"></A>admired and respected in consequence.
