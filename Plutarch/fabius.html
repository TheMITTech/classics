<BR>(legendary, died 203 B.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Having related the memorable actions of Pericles, our history now proceeds 
<A NAME="11"></A>to the life of Fabius. A son of Hercules and a nymph, of some woman of 
<A NAME="12"></A>that country, who brought him forth on the banks of Tiber, was, it is said, 
<A NAME="13"></A>the first Fabius, the founder of the numerous and distinguished family 
<A NAME="14"></A>of the name. Others will have it that they were first called Fodii, because 
<A NAME="15"></A>the first of the race delighted in digging pitfalls for wild beasts, fodere 
<A NAME="16"></A>being still the Latin for to dig, and fossa for a ditch, and that in process 
<A NAME="17"></A>of time, by the change of the two letters, they grew to be called Fabii. 
<A NAME="18"></A>But be these things true or false, certain it is that this family for a 
<A NAME="19"></A>long time yielded a great number of eminent persons. Our Fabius, who was 
<A NAME="20"></A>fourth in descent from that Fabius Rullus who first brought the honourable 
<A NAME="21"></A>surname of Maximus into his family, was also, by way of personal nickname, 
<A NAME="22"></A>called Verrucosus, from a wart on his upper lip; and in his childhood they 
<A NAME="23"></A>in like manner named him Ovicula, or The Lamb, on account of his extreme 
<A NAME="24"></A>mildness of temper. His slowness in speaking, his long labour and pains 
<A NAME="25"></A>in learning, his deliberation in entering into the sports of other children, 
<A NAME="26"></A>his easy submission to everybody, as if he had no will of his own, made 
<A NAME="27"></A>those who judge superficially of him, the greater number, esteem him insensible 
<A NAME="28"></A>and stupid; and few only saw that this tardiness proceeded from stability, 
<A NAME="29"></A>and discerned the greatness of his mind, and the lionlikeness of his temper. 
<A NAME="30"></A>But as soon as he came into employments, his virtues exerted and showed 
<A NAME="31"></A>themselves; his reputed want of energy then was recognized by people in 
<A NAME="32"></A>general as a freedom of passion; his slowness in words and actions, the 
<A NAME="33"></A>effect of a true prudence; his want of rapidity and his sluggishness, as 
<A NAME="34"></A>constancy and firmness.
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR>Living in a great commonwealth, surrounded by many enemies, he 
<A NAME="36"></A>saw the wisdom of inuring his body (nature's own weapon) to warlike exercises, 
<A NAME="37"></A>and disciplining his tongue for public oratory in a style conformable to 
<A NAME="38"></A>his life and character. His eloquence, indeed, had not much of popular 
<A NAME="39"></A>ornament, nor empty artifice, but there was in it great weight of sense; 
<A NAME="40"></A>it was strong and sententious, much after the way of Thucydides. We have 
<A NAME="41"></A>yet extant his funeral oration upon the death of his son, who died consul, 
<A NAME="42"></A>which he recited before the people.
<A NAME="43"></A><BR><BR>He was five times consul, and in his first consulship had the honour 
<A NAME="44"></A>of a triumph for the victory he gained over the Ligurians, whom he defeated 
<A NAME="45"></A>in a set battle, and drove them to take shelter in the Alps, from whence 
<A NAME="46"></A>they never after made any inroad or depredation upon their neighbours. 
<A NAME="47"></A>After this, Hannibal came into Italy, who, at his first entrance, having 
<A NAME="48"></A>gained a great battle near the river Trebia, traversed all Tuscany with 
<A NAME="49"></A>his victorious army, and, desolating the country round about, filled Rome 
<A NAME="50"></A>itself with astonishment and terror. Besides the more common signs of thunder 
<A NAME="51"></A>and lightning then happening, the report of several unheard of and utterly 
<A NAME="52"></A>strange portents much increased the popular consternation. For it was said 
<A NAME="53"></A>that some targets sweated blood; that at Antium, when they reaped their 
<A NAME="54"></A>corn, many of the ears were filled with blood; that it had rained red-hot 
<A NAME="55"></A>stones; that the Falerians had seen the heavens open and several scrolls 
<A NAME="56"></A>falling down, in one of which was plainly written, "Mars himself stirs 
<A NAME="57"></A>his arms." But these prodigies had no effect upon the impetuous and fiery 
<A NAME="58"></A>temper of the consul Flaminius, whose natural promptness had been much 
<A NAME="59"></A>heightened by his late unexpected victory over the Gauls, when he fought 
<A NAME="60"></A>them contrary to the order of the senate and the advice of his colleague. 
<A NAME="61"></A>Fabius, on the other side, thought it not seasonable to engage with the 
<A NAME="62"></A>enemy; not that he much regarded the prodigies, which he thought too strange 
<A NAME="63"></A>to be easily understood, though many were alarmed by them; but in regard 
<A NAME="64"></A>that the Carthaginians were but few, and in want of money and supplies, 
<A NAME="65"></A>he deemed it best not to meet in the field a general whose army had been 
<A NAME="66"></A>tried in many encounters, and whose object was a battle, but to send aid 
<A NAME="67"></A>to their allies, control the movements of the various subject cities, and 
<A NAME="68"></A>let the force and vigour of Hannibal waste away and expire, like a flame, 
<A NAME="69"></A>for want of the aliment.
<A NAME="70"></A><BR><BR>These weighty reasons did not prevail with Flaminius, who protested 
<A NAME="71"></A>he would never suffer the advance of the enemy to the city, nor be reduced, 
<A NAME="72"></A>like Camillus in former time, to fight for Rome within the walls of Rome. 
<A NAME="73"></A>Accordingly he ordered the tribunes to draw out the army into the field; 
<A NAME="74"></A>and though he himself, leaping on horseback to go out, was no sooner mounted 
<A NAME="75"></A>but the beast, without any apparent cause, fell into so violent a fit of 
<A NAME="76"></A>trembling and bounding that he cast his rider headlong on the ground; he 
<A NAME="77"></A>was no ways deterred, but proceeded as he had begun, and marched forward 
<A NAME="78"></A>up to Hannibal, who was posted near the Lake Thrasymene in Tuscany. At 
<A NAME="79"></A>the moment of this engagement, there happened so great an earthquake, that 
<A NAME="80"></A>it destroyed several towns, altered the course of rivers, and carried off 
<A NAME="81"></A>parts of high cliffs, yet such was the eagerness of the combatants, that 
<A NAME="82"></A>they were entirely insensible of it.
<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR>In this battle Flaminius fell, after many proofs of his strength 
<A NAME="84"></A>and courage, and round about him all the bravest of the army; in the whole, 
<A NAME="85"></A>fifteen thousand were killed, and as many made prisoners. Hannibal, desirous 
<A NAME="86"></A>to bestow funeral honours upon the body of Flaminius, made diligent search 
<A NAME="87"></A>after it, but could not find it among the dead, nor was it ever known what 
<A NAME="88"></A>became of it. Upon the former engagement near Trebia, neither the general 
<A NAME="89"></A>who wrote, nor the express who told the news, used straightforward and 
<A NAME="90"></A>direct terms, nor related it otherwise than as a drawn battle, with equal 
<A NAME="91"></A>loss on either side; but on this occasion as soon as Pomponius the praetor 
<A NAME="92"></A>had the intelligence, he caused the people to assemble, and, without disguising 
<A NAME="93"></A>or dissembling the matter, told them plainly, "We are beaten, O Romans, 
<A NAME="94"></A>in a great battle; the consul Flaminius is killed; think, therefore, what 
<A NAME="95"></A>is to be done for your safety." Letting loose his news like a gate of wind 
<A NAME="96"></A>upon an open sea, he threw the city into utter confusion: in such consternation, 
<A NAME="97"></A>their thoughts found no support or stay. The danger at hand at last awakened 
<A NAME="98"></A>their judgments into a resolution to choose a dictator, who by the sovereign 
<A NAME="99"></A>authority of his office, and by his personal wisdom and courage, might 
<A NAME="100"></A>be able to manage the public affairs. Their choice unanimously fell upon 
<A NAME="101"></A>Fabius, whose character seemed equal to the greatness of the office; whose 
<A NAME="102"></A>age was so far advanced as to give him experience, without taking from 
<A NAME="103"></A>him the vigour of action; his body could execute what his soul designed; 
<A NAME="104"></A>and his temper was a happy compound of confidence and 
<A NAME="105"></A>cautiousness.
<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR>Fabius, being thus installed in the office of dictator, in the 
<A NAME="107"></A>first place gave the command of the horse to Lucius Minucius; and next 
<A NAME="108"></A>asked leave of the senate for himself, that in time of battle he might 
<A NAME="109"></A>serve on horseback, which by an ancient law amongst the Romans was forbid 
<A NAME="110"></A>to their generals; whether it were, that, placing their greatest strength 
<A NAME="111"></A>in their foot, they would have their commanders-in-chief posted amongst 
<A NAME="112"></A>them, or else to let them know, that, how great and absolute soever their 
<A NAME="113"></A>authority were, the people and senate were still their masters, of whom 
<A NAME="114"></A>they must ask leave. Fabius, however, to make the authority of his charge 
<A NAME="115"></A>more observable, and to render the people more submissive and obedient 
<A NAME="116"></A>to him, caused himself to be accompanied with the full body of four-and-twenty 
<A NAME="117"></A>lictors; and, when the surviving consul came to visit him, sent him word 
<A NAME="118"></A>to dismiss his lictors with their fasces, the ensigns of authority, and 
<A NAME="119"></A>appear before him as a private person.
<A NAME="120"></A><BR><BR>The first solemn action of his dictatorship was very fitly a religious 
<A NAME="121"></A>one: an admonition to the people, that their late overthrow had not befallen 
<A NAME="122"></A>them through want of courage in their soldiers, but through the neglect 
<A NAME="123"></A>of divine ceremonies in the general. He therefore exhorted them not to 
<A NAME="124"></A>fear the enemy, but by extraordinary honour to propitiate the gods. This 
<A NAME="125"></A>he did, not to fill their minds with superstition, but by religious feeling 
<A NAME="126"></A>to raise their courage, and lessen their fear of the enemy by inspiring 
<A NAME="127"></A>the belief that Heaven was on their side. With this view, the secret prophecies 
<A NAME="128"></A>called the Sibylline Books were consulted; sundry predictions found in 
<A NAME="129"></A>them were said to refer to the fortunes and events of the time; but none 
<A NAME="130"></A>except the consulter was informed. Presenting himself to the people, the 
<A NAME="131"></A>dictator made a vow before them to offer in sacrifice the whole product 
<A NAME="132"></A>of the next season, all Italy over, of the cows, goats, swine, sheep, both 
<A NAME="133"></A>in the mountains and the plains; and to celebrate musical festivities with 
<A NAME="134"></A>an expenditure of the precise sum of 333 sestertia and 333 denarii, with 
<A NAME="135"></A>one-third of a denarius over. The sum total of which is, in our money, 
<A NAME="136"></A>83,583 drachmas and 2 obols. What the mystery might be in that exact number 
<A NAME="137"></A>is not easy to determine, unless it were in honour of the perfection of 
<A NAME="138"></A>the number three, as being the first of odd numbers, the first that contains 
<A NAME="139"></A>in itself multiplication, with all other properties whatsoever belonging 
<A NAME="140"></A>to numbers in general.
<A NAME="141"></A><BR><BR>In this manner Fabius, having given the people better heart for 
<A NAME="142"></A>the future, by making them believe that the gods took their side, for his 
<A NAME="143"></A>own part placed his whole confidence in himself, believing that the gods 
<A NAME="144"></A>bestowed victory and good fortune by the instrumentality of valour and 
<A NAME="145"></A>of prudence; and thus prepared he set forth to oppose Hannibal, not with 
<A NAME="146"></A>intention to fight him, but with the purpose of wearing out and wasting 
<A NAME="147"></A>the vigour of his arms by lapse of time, of meeting his want of resources 
<A NAME="148"></A>by superior means, by large numbers the smallness of his forces. With this 
<A NAME="149"></A>design, he always encamped on the highest grounds, where the enemy's horse 
<A NAME="150"></A>could have no access to him. Still he kept pace with them; when they marched 
<A NAME="151"></A>he followed them; when they encamped he did the same, but at such a distance 
<A NAME="152"></A>as not to be compelled to an engagement and always keeping upon the hills, 
<A NAME="153"></A>free from the insults of their horse; by which means he gave them no rest, 
<A NAME="154"></A>but kept them in a continual alarm.
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR>But this his dilatory way gave occasion in his own camp for suspicion 
<A NAME="156"></A>of want of courage; and this opinion prevailed yet more in Hannibal's army. 
<A NAME="157"></A>Hannibal was himself the only man who was not deceived, who discerned his 
<A NAME="158"></A>skill and detected his tactics, and saw, unless he could by art or force 
<A NAME="159"></A>bring him to battle, that the Carthaginians, unable to use the arms in 
<A NAME="160"></A>which they were superior, and suffering the continual drain of lives and 
<A NAME="161"></A>treasure in which they were inferior, would in the end come to nothing. 
<A NAME="162"></A>He resolved, therefore, with all the arts and subtleties of war to break 
<A NAME="163"></A>his measures and to bring Fabius to an engagement, like a cunning wrestler, 
<A NAME="164"></A>watching every opportunity to get good hold and close with his adversary. 
<A NAME="165"></A>He at one time attacked, and sought to distract his attention, tried to 
<A NAME="166"></A>draw him off in various directions, and endeavoured in all ways to tempt 
<A NAME="167"></A>him from his safe policy. All this artifice, though it had no effect upon 
<A NAME="168"></A>the firm judgment and conviction of the dictator, yet upon the common soldier, 
<A NAME="169"></A>and even upon the general of the horse himself, it had too great an operation: 
<A NAME="170"></A>Minucius, unseasonably eager for action, bold and confident, humoured the 
<A NAME="171"></A>soldiery, and himself contributed to fill them with wild eagerness and 
<A NAME="172"></A>empty hopes, which they vented in reproaches upon Fabius, calling him Hannibal's 
<A NAME="173"></A>pedagogue, since he did nothing else but follow him up and down and wait 
<A NAME="174"></A>upon him. At the same time, they cried up Minucius for the only captain 
<A NAME="175"></A>worthy to command the Romans; whose vanity and presumption rose so high 
<A NAME="176"></A>in consequence, that he insolently jested at Fabius's encampment upon the 
<A NAME="177"></A>mountains, saying that he seated them there as on a theatre, to behold 
<A NAME="178"></A>the flames and desolation of their country. And he would sometimes ask 
<A NAME="179"></A>the friends of the general, whether it were not his meaning, by thus leading 
<A NAME="180"></A>them from mountain to mountain, to carry them at last (having no hopes 
<A NAME="181"></A>on earth) up into heaven, or to hide them in the clouds from Hannibal's 
<A NAME="182"></A>army? When his friends reported these things to the dictator, persuading 
<A NAME="183"></A>him that, to avoid the general obloquy, he should engage the enemy, his 
<A NAME="184"></A>answer was, "I should be more faint-hearted than they make me, if, through 
<A NAME="185"></A>fear of idle reproaches, I should abandon my own convictions. It is no 
<A NAME="186"></A>inglorious thing to have fear for the safety of our country, but to be 
<A NAME="187"></A>turned from one's course by men's opinions, by blame, and by misrepresentation, 
<A NAME="188"></A>shows a man unfit to hold an office such as this, which, by such conduct, 
<A NAME="189"></A>he makes the slaves of those whose errors it is his business to 
<A NAME="190"></A>control."
<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR>An oversight of Hannibal occurred soon after. Desirous to refresh 
<A NAME="192"></A>his horse in some good pasture-grounds, and to draw off his army, he ordered 
<A NAME="193"></A>his guides to conduct him to the district of Casinum. They, mistaking his 
<A NAME="194"></A>bad pronunciation, led him and his army to the town of Casilinum, on the 
<A NAME="195"></A>frontier of Campania which the river Lothronus, called by the Romans Vulturnus, 
<A NAME="196"></A>divides in two parts. The country around is enclosed by mountains, with 
<A NAME="197"></A>a valley opening towards the sea, in which the river overflowing forms 
<A NAME="198"></A>a quantity of marsh land with deep banks of sand, and discharges itself 
<A NAME="199"></A>into the sea on a very unsafe and rough shore. While Hannibal was proceeding 
<A NAME="200"></A>hither, Fabius, by his knowledge of the roads, succeeded in making his 
<A NAME="201"></A>way around before him, and despatched four thousand choice men to seize 
<A NAME="202"></A>the exit from it and stop him up, and lodged the rest of his army upon 
<A NAME="203"></A>the neighbouring hills, in the most advantageous places; at the same time 
<A NAME="204"></A>detaching a party of his lightest armed men to fall upon Hannibal's rear; 
<A NAME="205"></A>which they did with such success, that they cut off eight hundred of them, 
<A NAME="206"></A>and put the whole army in disorder. Hannibal, finding the error and the 
<A NAME="207"></A>danger he was fallen into, immediately crucified the guides; but considered 
<A NAME="208"></A>the enemy to be so advantageously posted, that there was no hope of breaking 
<A NAME="209"></A>through them; while his soldiers began to be despondent and terrified, 
<A NAME="210"></A>and to think themselves surrounded with embarrassments too difficult to 
<A NAME="211"></A>be surmounted.
<A NAME="212"></A><BR><BR>Thus reduced, Hannibal had recourse to stratagem; he caused two 
<A NAME="213"></A>thousand head of oxen which he had in his camp to have torches or dry fagots 
<A NAME="214"></A>well fastened to their horns, and lighting them in the beginning of the 
<A NAME="215"></A>night, ordered the beasts to be driven on towards the heights commanding 
<A NAME="216"></A>the passages out of the valley and the enemy's posts; when this was done, 
<A NAME="217"></A>he made his army in the dark leisurely march after them. The oxen at first 
<A NAME="218"></A>kept a slow orderly pace, and with their lighted heads resembled an army 
<A NAME="219"></A>marching by night, astonishing the shepherds and herdsmen of the hills 
<A NAME="220"></A>about. But when the fire burnt down the horns of the beasts to the quick, 
<A NAME="221"></A>they no longer observed their sober pace, but unruly and wild with their 
<A NAME="222"></A>pain, ran dispersed about, tossing their heads and scattering the fire 
<A NAME="223"></A>round about them upon each other and setting light as they passed to the 
<A NAME="224"></A>trees. This was a surprising spectacle to the Romans on guard upon the 
<A NAME="225"></A>heights. Seeing flames which appeared to come from men advancing with torches, 
<A NAME="226"></A>they were possessed with the alarm that the enemy was approaching in various 
<A NAME="227"></A>quarters, and that they were being surrounded; and, quitting their post, 
<A NAME="228"></A>abandoned the pass, and precipitately retired to their camp on the hills. 
<A NAME="229"></A>They were no sooner gone, but the light-armed of Hannibal's men, according 
<A NAME="230"></A>to his order, immediately seized the heights, and soon after the whole 
<A NAME="231"></A>army, with all the baggage, came up and safely marched through the 
<A NAME="232"></A>passes.
<A NAME="233"></A><BR><BR>Fabius, before the night was over, quickly found out the trick; 
<A NAME="234"></A>for some of the beasts fell into his hands; but for fear of an ambush in 
<A NAME="235"></A>the dark, he kept his men all night to their arms in the camp. As soon 
<A NAME="236"></A>as it was day, he attacked the enemy in the rear, where, after a good deal 
<A NAME="237"></A>of skirmishing in the uneven ground, the disorder might have become general, 
<A NAME="238"></A>but that Hannibal detached from his van a body of Spaniards, who, of themselves 
<A NAME="239"></A>active and nimble, were accustomed to the climbing of mountains. These 
<A NAME="240"></A>briskly attacked the Roman troops, who were in heavy armour, killed a good 
<A NAME="241"></A>many, and left Fabius no longer in condition to follow the enemy. This 
<A NAME="242"></A>action brought the extreme of obloquy and contempt upon the dictator; they 
<A NAME="243"></A>said it was now manifest that he was not only inferior to his adversary, 
<A NAME="244"></A>as they had always thought, in courage, but even in that conduct, foresight, 
<A NAME="245"></A>and generalship, by which he had proposed to bring the war to an 
<A NAME="246"></A>end.
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR>And Hannibal, to enhance their anger against him, marched with 
<A NAME="248"></A>his army close to the lands and possessions of Fabius, and, giving orders 
<A NAME="249"></A>to his soldiers to burn and destroy all the country about, forbade them 
<A NAME="250"></A>to do the least damage in the estates of the Roman general, and placed 
<A NAME="251"></A>guards for their security. This, when reported at Rome, had the effect 
<A NAME="252"></A>with the people which Hannibal desired. Their tribunes raised a thousand 
<A NAME="253"></A>stories against him, chiefly at the instigation of Metilius, who, not so 
<A NAME="254"></A>much out of hatred to him as out of friendship to Minucius, whose kinsman 
<A NAME="255"></A>he was, thought by depressing Fabius to raise his friend. The senate on 
<A NAME="256"></A>their part were also offended with him for the bargain he had made with 
<A NAME="257"></A>Hannibal about the exchange of prisoners, the conditions of which were 
<A NAME="258"></A>that, after exchange made of man for man, if any on either side remained, 
<A NAME="259"></A>they should be redeemed at the price of two hundred and fifty drachmas 
<A NAME="260"></A>a head. Upon the whole account, there remained two hundred and forty Romans 
<A NAME="261"></A>unexchanged, and the senate now not only refused to allow money for the 
<A NAME="262"></A>ransoms, but also reproached Fabius for making a contract, contrary to 
<A NAME="263"></A>the honour and interest of the commonwealth, for redeeming men whose cowardice 
<A NAME="264"></A>had put them in the hands of the enemy. Fabius heard and endured all this 
<A NAME="265"></A>with invincible patience; and, having no money by him, and on the other 
<A NAME="266"></A>side being resolved to keep his word with Hannibal and not to abandon the 
<A NAME="267"></A>captives, he despatched his son to Rome to sell land, and to bring with 
<A NAME="268"></A>him the price, sufficient to discharge the ransoms; which was punctually 
<A NAME="269"></A>performed by his son and delivery accordingly made to him of the prisoners, 
<A NAME="270"></A>amongst whom many, when they were released, made proposals to repay the 
<A NAME="271"></A>money; which Fabius in all cases declined.
<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR>About this time, he was called to Rome by the priests, to assist, 
<A NAME="273"></A>according to the duty of his office, at certain sacrifices, and was thus 
<A NAME="274"></A>forced to leave the command of the army with Minucius; but before he parted, 
<A NAME="275"></A>not only charged him as his commander-in-chief, but besought and entreated 
<A NAME="276"></A>him not to come, in his absence, to a battle with Hannibal. His commands, 
<A NAME="277"></A>entreaties, and advice were lost upon Minucius, for his back was no sooner 
<A NAME="278"></A>turned but the new general immediately sought occasions to attack the enemy. 
<A NAME="279"></A>And notice being brought him that Hannibal had sent out a great part of 
<A NAME="280"></A>his army to forage, he fell upon a detachment of the remainder, doing great 
<A NAME="281"></A>execution, and driving them to their very camp, with no little terror to 
<A NAME="282"></A>the rest, who apprehended their breaking in upon them; and when Hannibal 
<A NAME="283"></A>had recalled his scattered forces to the camp, he, nevertheless, without 
<A NAME="284"></A>any loss, made his retreat, a success which aggravated his boldness and 
<A NAME="285"></A>presumption, and filled the soldiers with rash confidence. The news spread 
<A NAME="286"></A>to Rome, where Fabius, on being told it, said that what he most feared 
<A NAME="287"></A>was Minucius's success; but the people, highly elated, hurried to the forum 
<A NAME="288"></A>to listen to an address from Metilius the tribune, in which he infinitely 
<A NAME="289"></A>extolled the valour of Minucius, and fell bitterly upon Fabius, accusing 
<A NAME="290"></A>him for want not merely of courage, but even of loyalty; and not only him, 
<A NAME="291"></A>but also many other eminent and considerable persons; saying that it was 
<A NAME="292"></A>they that had brought the Carthaginians into Italy, with the design to 
<A NAME="293"></A>destroy the liberty of the people; for which end they had at once put the 
<A NAME="294"></A>supreme authority into the hands of a single person, who by his slowness 
<A NAME="295"></A>and delays might give Hannibal leisure to establish himself in Italy, and 
<A NAME="296"></A>the people of Carthage time and opportunity to supply him with fresh succours 
<A NAME="297"></A>to complete his conquest.
<A NAME="298"></A><BR><BR>Fabius came forward with no intention to answer the tribune, but 
<A NAME="299"></A>only said, that they should expedite the sacrifices, that so he might speedily 
<A NAME="300"></A>return to the army to punish Minucius, who had presumed to fight contrary 
<A NAME="301"></A>to his orders; words which immediately possessed the people with the belief 
<A NAME="302"></A>that Minucius stood in danger of his life. For it was in the power of the 
<A NAME="303"></A>dictator to imprison and to put to death, and they feared that Fabius, 
<A NAME="304"></A>of a mild temper in general, would be as hard to be appeased when once 
<A NAME="305"></A>irritated, as he was slow to be provoked. Nobody dared to raise his voice 
<A NAME="306"></A>in opposition; Metilius alone, whose office of tribune gave him security 
<A NAME="307"></A>to say what he pleased (for in the time of a dictatorship that magistrateal 
<A NAME="308"></A>one preserves his authority), boldly applied himself to the people in the 
<A NAME="309"></A>behalf of Minucius; that they should not suffer him to be made a sacrifice 
<A NAME="310"></A>to the enmity of Fabius, nor permit him to be destroyed, like the son of 
<A NAME="311"></A>Manlius Torquatus, who was beheaded by his father for a victory fought 
<A NAME="312"></A>and triumphantly won against order; he exhorted them to take away from 
<A NAME="313"></A>Fabius that absolute power of a dictator, and to put it into more worthy 
<A NAME="314"></A>hands, better able and more inclined to use it for the public good. These 
<A NAME="315"></A>impressions very much prevailed upon the people, though not so far as wholly 
<A NAME="316"></A>to dispossess Fabius of the dictatorship. But they decreed that Minucius 
<A NAME="317"></A>should have an equal authority with the dictator in the conduct of the 
<A NAME="318"></A>war; which was a thing then without precedent, though a little later it 
<A NAME="319"></A>was again practised after the disaster at Cannae; when the dictator, Marcus 
<A NAME="320"></A>Junius, being with the army, they chose at Rome Fabius Buteo dictator, 
<A NAME="321"></A>that he might create new senators, to supply the numerous places of those 
<A NAME="322"></A>who were killed. But as soon as, once acting in public, he had filled those 
<A NAME="323"></A>vacant places with a sufficient number, he immediately dismissed his lictors, 
<A NAME="324"></A>and withdrew from all his attendance, and mingling like a common person 
<A NAME="325"></A>with the rest of the people, quietly went about his own affairs in the 
<A NAME="326"></A>forum.
<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR>The enemies of Fabius thought they had sufficiently humiliated 
<A NAME="328"></A>and subdued him by raising Minucius to be his equal in authority; but they 
<A NAME="329"></A>mistook the temper of the man, who looked upon their folly as not his loss, 
<A NAME="330"></A>but like Diogenes, who, being told that some persons derided him, made 
<A NAME="331"></A>answer, "But I am not derided," meaning that only those were really insulted 
<A NAME="332"></A>on whom such insults made an impression, so Fabius, with great tranquillity 
<A NAME="333"></A>and unconcern, submitted to what happened, and contributed a proof to the 
<A NAME="334"></A>argument of the philosophers that a just and good man is not capable of 
<A NAME="335"></A>being dishonoured. His only vexation arose from his fear lest this ill 
<A NAME="336"></A>counsel, by supplying opportunities to the diseased military ambition of 
<A NAME="337"></A>his subordinate, should damage the public cause. Lest the rashness of Minucius 
<A NAME="338"></A>should now at once run headlong into some disaster, he returned back with 
<A NAME="339"></A>all privacy and speed to the army; where he found Minucius so elevated 
<A NAME="340"></A>with his new dignity, that, a joint-authority not contenting him, he required 
<A NAME="341"></A>by turns to have the command of the army every other day. This Fabius rejected, 
<A NAME="342"></A>but was contented that the army should be divided; thinking each general 
<A NAME="343"></A>singly would better command his part, than partially command the whole. 
<A NAME="344"></A>The first and fourth legion he took for his own division, the second and 
<A NAME="345"></A>third he delivered to Minucius; so also of the auxiliary forces each had 
<A NAME="346"></A>an equal share.
<A NAME="347"></A><BR><BR>Minucius, thus exalted, could not contain himself from boasting 
<A NAME="348"></A>of his success in humiliating the high and powerful office of the dictatorship. 
<A NAME="349"></A>Fabius quietly reminded him that it was, in all wisdom, Hannibal, and not 
<A NAME="350"></A>Fabius, whom he had to combat; but if he must needs contend with his colleague, 
<A NAME="351"></A>it had best be in diligence and care for the preservation of Rome; that 
<A NAME="352"></A>it might not be said, a man so favoured by the people served them worse 
<A NAME="353"></A>than he who had been ill-treated and disgraced by them.
<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR>The young general, despising these admonitions as the false humility 
<A NAME="355"></A>of age, immediately removed with the body of his army, and encamped by 
<A NAME="356"></A>himself. Hannibal, who was not ignorant of all these passages, lay watching 
<A NAME="357"></A>his advantage from them. It happened that between his army and that of 
<A NAME="358"></A>Minucius there was a certain eminence, which seemed a very advantageous 
<A NAME="359"></A>and not difficult post to encamp upon; the level field around it appeared, 
<A NAME="360"></A>from a distance, to be all smooth and even, though it had many inconsiderable 
<A NAME="361"></A>ditches and dips in it, not discernible to the eye. Hannibal, had he pleased, 
<A NAME="362"></A>could easily have possessed himself of this ground; but he had reserved 
<A NAME="363"></A>it for a bait, or train, in proper season, to draw the Romans to an engagement. 
<A NAME="364"></A>Now that Minucius and Fabius were divided, he thought the opportunity fair 
<A NAME="365"></A>for his purpose; and, therefore, having in the night-time lodged a convenient 
<A NAME="366"></A>number of his men in these ditches and hollow places, early in the morning 
<A NAME="367"></A>he sent forth a small detachment, who, in the sight of Minucius, proceeded 
<A NAME="368"></A>to possess themselves of the rising ground. According to his expectation, 
<A NAME="369"></A>Minucius swallowed the bait, and first sends out his light troops, and 
<A NAME="370"></A>after them some horse, to dislodge the enemy; and, at last, when he saw 
<A NAME="371"></A>Hannibal in person advancing to the assistance of his men, marched down 
<A NAME="372"></A>with his whole army drawn up. He engaged with the troops on the eminence, 
<A NAME="373"></A>and sustained their missiles; the combat for some time was equal; but as 
<A NAME="374"></A>soon as Hannibal perceived that the whole army was now sufficiently advanced 
<A NAME="375"></A>within the toils he had set for them, so that their backs were open to 
<A NAME="376"></A>his men whom he had posted in the hollows, he gave the signal; upon which 
<A NAME="377"></A>they rushed forth from various quarters, and with loud cries furiously 
<A NAME="378"></A>attacked Minucius in the rear. The surprise and the slaughter was great, 
<A NAME="379"></A>and struck universal alarm and disorder through the whole army. Minucius 
<A NAME="380"></A>himself lost all his confidence; he looked from officer to officer, and 
<A NAME="381"></A>found all alike unprepared to face the danger, and yielding to a flight, 
<A NAME="382"></A>which, however, could not end in safety. The Numidian horsemen were already 
<A NAME="383"></A>in full victory riding about the plain, cutting down the 
<A NAME="384"></A>fugitives.
<A NAME="385"></A><BR><BR>Fabius was not ignorant of this danger of his countrymen; he foresaw 
<A NAME="386"></A>what would happen from the rashness of Minucius, and the cunning of Hannibal; 
<A NAME="387"></A>and, therefore, kept his men to their arms, in readiness to wait the event; 
<A NAME="388"></A>nor would he trust to the reports of others, but he himself, in front of 
<A NAME="389"></A>his camp, viewed all that passed. When, therefore, he saw the army of Minucius 
<A NAME="390"></A>encompassed by the enemy, and that by their countenance and shifting their 
<A NAME="391"></A>ground they appeared more disposed to flight than to resistance, with a 
<A NAME="392"></A>great sigh, striking his hand upon his thigh, he said to those about him, 
<A NAME="393"></A>"O Hercules! how much sooner than I expected, though later than he seemed 
<A NAME="394"></A>to desire, hath Minucius destroyed himself!" He then commanded the ensigns 
<A NAME="395"></A>to be led forward, and the army to follow, telling them, "We must make 
<A NAME="396"></A>haste to rescue Minucius, who is a valiant man, and a lover of his country; 
<A NAME="397"></A>and if he hath been too forward to engage the enemy, at another time we 
<A NAME="398"></A>will tell him of it." Thus, at the head of his men, Fabius marched up to 
<A NAME="399"></A>the enemy, and first cleared the plain of the Numidians; and next fell 
<A NAME="400"></A>upon those who were charging the Romans in the rear, cutting down all that 
<A NAME="401"></A>made opposition, and obliging the rest to save themselves by a hasty retreat, 
<A NAME="402"></A>lest they should be environed as the Romans had been. Hannibal, seeing 
<A NAME="403"></A>so sudden a change of affairs, and Fabius, beyond the force of his age, 
<A NAME="404"></A>opening his way through the ranks up the hillside, that he might join Minucius, 
<A NAME="405"></A>warily forbore, sounded a retreat, and drew off his men into their camp; 
<A NAME="406"></A>while the Romans on their part were no less contented to retire in safety. 
<A NAME="407"></A>It is reported that upon this occasion Hannibal said jestingly to his friends: 
<A NAME="408"></A>"Did not I tell you, that this cloud which always hovered upon the mountains 
<A NAME="409"></A>would, at some time or other, come down with a storm upon 
<A NAME="410"></A>us?"
<A NAME="411"></A><BR><BR>Fabius, after his men had picked up the spoils of the field, retired 
<A NAME="412"></A>to his own camp, without saying any harsh or reproachful thing to his colleague; 
<A NAME="413"></A>who, also, in his part, gathering his army together, spoke and said to 
<A NAME="414"></A>them: "To conduct great matters and never commit a fault is above the force 
<A NAME="415"></A>of human nature; but to learn and improve by the faults we have committed, 
<A NAME="416"></A>is that which becomes a good and sensible man. Some reasons I may have 
<A NAME="417"></A>to accuse fortune, but I have many more to thank her; for in a few hours 
<A NAME="418"></A>she hath cured a long mistake, and taught me that I am not the man who 
<A NAME="419"></A>should command others, but have need of another to command me; and that 
<A NAME="420"></A>we are not to contend for victory over those to whom it is our advantage 
<A NAME="421"></A>to yield. Therefore in everything else henceforth the dictator must be 
<A NAME="422"></A>your commander; only in showing gratitude towards him I will still be your 
<A NAME="423"></A>leader, and always be the first to obey his orders." Having said this, 
<A NAME="424"></A>he commanded the Roman eagles to move forward, and all his men to follow 
<A NAME="425"></A>him to the camp of Fabius. The soldiers, then, as he entered, stood amazed 
<A NAME="426"></A>at the novelty of the sight, and were anxious and doubtful what the meaning 
<A NAME="427"></A>might be. When he came near the dictator's tent, Fabius went forth to meet 
<A NAME="428"></A>him, on which he at once laid his standards at his feet, calling him with 
<A NAME="429"></A>a loud voice his father; while the soldiers with him saluted the soldiers 
<A NAME="430"></A>here as their patrons, the term employed by freedmen to those who gave 
<A NAME="431"></A>them their liberty. After silence was obtained, Minucius said, "You have 
<A NAME="432"></A>this day, O dictator, obtained two victories; one by your valour and conduct 
<A NAME="433"></A>over Hannibal, and another by your wisdom and goodness over your colleague; 
<A NAME="434"></A>by one victory you preserved, and by the other instructed us; and when 
<A NAME="435"></A>we were already suffering one shameful defeat from Hannibal, by another 
<A NAME="436"></A>welcome one from you we were restored to honour and safety. I can address 
<A NAME="437"></A>you by no nobler name than that of a kind father, though a father's beneficence 
<A NAME="438"></A>falls short of that I have received from you. Front a father I individually 
<A NAME="439"></A>received the gift of life; to you I owe its preservation not for myself 
<A NAME="440"></A>only, but for all these who are under me." After this, he threw himself 
<A NAME="441"></A>into the arms of the dictator; and in the same manner the soldiers of each 
<A NAME="442"></A>army embraced one another with gladness and tears of 
<A NAME="443"></A>joy.
<A NAME="444"></A><BR><BR>Not long after, Fabius laid down the dictatorship, and consuls 
<A NAME="445"></A>were again created. Those who immediately succeeded observed the same method 
<A NAME="446"></A>in managing the war, and avoided all occasions of fighting Hannibal in 
<A NAME="447"></A>a pitched battle; they only succoured their allies, and preserved the towns 
<A NAME="448"></A>from falling off to the enemy. But afterwards, when Terentius Varro, a 
<A NAME="449"></A>man of obscure birth, but very popular and bold, had obtained the consulship, 
<A NAME="450"></A>he soon made it appear that by his rashness and ignorance he would stake 
<A NAME="451"></A>the whole commonwealth on the hazard. For it was his custom to declaim 
<A NAME="452"></A>in all assemblies, that, as long as Rome employed generals like Fabius, 
<A NAME="453"></A>there never would be an end of the war; vaunting that whenever he should 
<A NAME="454"></A>get sight of the enemy, he would that same day free Italy from the strangers. 
<A NAME="455"></A>With these promises he so prevailed, that he raised a greater army than 
<A NAME="456"></A>had ever yet been sent out of Rome. There were enlisted eighty-eight thousand 
<A NAME="457"></A>fighting men; but what gave confidence to the populace, only terrified 
<A NAME="458"></A>the wise and experienced, and none more than Fabius; since if so great 
<A NAME="459"></A>a body, and the flower of the Roman youth, should be cut off, they could 
<A NAME="460"></A>not see any new resource for the safety of Rome. They addressed themselves, 
<A NAME="461"></A>therefore, to the other consul, Aemilius Paulus, a man of great experience 
<A NAME="462"></A>in war, but unpopular, and fearful also of the people, who once before 
<A NAME="463"></A>upon some impeachment had condemned him; so that he needed encouragement 
<A NAME="464"></A>to withstand his colleague's temerity. Fabius told him, if he would profitably 
<A NAME="465"></A>serve his country, he must no less oppose Varro's ignorant eagerness than 
<A NAME="466"></A>Hannibal's conscious readiness, since both alike conspired to decide the 
<A NAME="467"></A>fate of Rome by a battle. "It is more reasonable," he said to him, "that 
<A NAME="468"></A>you should believe me than Varro, in matters relating to Hannibal, when 
<A NAME="469"></A>I tell you that if for this year you abstain from fighting with him, either 
<A NAME="470"></A>his army will perish of itself, or else he will be glad to depart of his 
<A NAME="471"></A>own will. This evidently appears, inasmuch as, notwithstanding his victories, 
<A NAME="472"></A>none of the countries or towns of Italy come in to him, and his army is 
<A NAME="473"></A>not now the third part of what it was at first." To this Paulus is said 
<A NAME="474"></A>to have replied, "Did I only consider myself, I should rather choose to 
<A NAME="475"></A>be exposed to the weapons of Hannibal than once more to the suffrages of 
<A NAME="476"></A>my fellow-citizens, who are urgent for what you disapprove; yet since the 
<A NAME="477"></A>cause of Rome is at stake, I will rather seek in my conduct to please and 
<A NAME="478"></A>obey Fabius than all the world besides."
<A NAME="479"></A><BR><BR>These good measures were defeated by the importunity of Varro; 
<A NAME="480"></A>whom, when they were both come to the army, nothing would content but a 
<A NAME="481"></A>separate command, that each consul should have his day; and when his turn 
<A NAME="482"></A>came, he posted his army close to Hannibal, at a village called Cannae, 
<A NAME="483"></A>by the river Aufidus. It was no sooner day, but he set up the scarlet coat 
<A NAME="484"></A>flying over his tent, which was the signal of battle. This boldness of 
<A NAME="485"></A>the consul, and the numerousness of his army, double theirs, startled the 
<A NAME="486"></A>Carthaginians; but Hannibal commanded them to their arms, and with a small 
<A NAME="487"></A>train rode out to take a full prospect of the enemy as they were now forming 
<A NAME="488"></A>in their ranks, from a rising ground not far distant. One of his followers, 
<A NAME="489"></A>called Gisco, a Carthaginian of equal rank with himself, told him that 
<A NAME="490"></A>the numbers of the enemy were astonishing; to which Hannibal replied with 
<A NAME="491"></A>a serious countenance, "There is one thing, Gisco, yet more astonishing, 
<A NAME="492"></A>which you take no notice of;" and when Gisco inquired what, answered, that 
<A NAME="493"></A>"in all those great numbers before us, there is not one man called Gisco." 
<A NAME="494"></A>This unexpected jest of their general made all the company laugh, and as 
<A NAME="495"></A>they came down from the hill they told it to those whom they met, which 
<A NAME="496"></A>caused a general laughter amongst them all, from which they were hardly 
<A NAME="497"></A>able to recover themselves. The army, seeing Hannibal's attendants come 
<A NAME="498"></A>back from viewing the enemy in such a laughing condition, concluded that 
<A NAME="499"></A>it must be profound contempt of the enemy, that made their general at this 
<A NAME="500"></A>moment indulge in such hilarity.
<A NAME="501"></A><BR><BR>According to his usual manner, Hannibal employed stratagems to 
<A NAME="502"></A>advantage himself. In the first place, he so drew up his men that the wind 
<A NAME="503"></A>was at their backs, which at that time blew with a perfect storm of violence, 
<A NAME="504"></A>and, sweeping over the great plains of sand, carried before it a cloud 
<A NAME="505"></A>of dust over the Carthaginian army into the faces of the Romans, which 
<A NAME="506"></A>much disturbed them in the fight. In the next place, all his best men he 
<A NAME="507"></A>put into his wings; and in the body which was somewhat more advanced than 
<A NAME="508"></A>the wings, placed the worst and the weakest of his army. He commanded those 
<A NAME="509"></A>in the wings, that, when the enemy had made a thorough charge upon that 
<A NAME="510"></A>middle advance body, which he knew would recoil, as not being able to withstand 
<A NAME="511"></A>their shock, and when the Romans in their pursuit should be far enough 
<A NAME="512"></A>engaged within the two wings, they should, both on the right and the left, 
<A NAME="513"></A>charge them in the flank, and endeavour to encompass them. This appears 
<A NAME="514"></A>to have been the chief cause of the Roman loss. Pressing upon Hannibal's 
<A NAME="515"></A>front, which gave ground, they reduced the form of his army into a perfect 
<A NAME="516"></A>half-moon, and gave ample opportunity to the captains of the chosen troops 
<A NAME="517"></A>to charge them right and left on their flanks, and to cut off and destroy 
<A NAME="518"></A>all who did not fall back before the Carthaginian wings united in their 
<A NAME="519"></A>rear. To this general calamity, it is also said, that a strange mistake 
<A NAME="520"></A>among the cavalry much contributed. For the horse of Aemilius receiving 
<A NAME="521"></A>a hurt and throwing his master, those about him immediately alighted to 
<A NAME="522"></A>aid the consul; and the Roman troops, seeing their commanders thus quitting 
<A NAME="523"></A>their horses, took it for a sign that they should all dismount and charge 
<A NAME="524"></A>the enemy on foot. At the sight of this, Hannibal was heard to say, "This 
<A NAME="525"></A>pleases me better than if they had been delivered to me bound hand and 
<A NAME="526"></A>foot." For the particulars of this engagement, we refer our reader to those 
<A NAME="527"></A>authors who have written at large upon the subject.
<A NAME="528"></A><BR><BR>The consul Varro, with a thin company, fled to Venusia; Aemilius 
<A NAME="529"></A>Paulus, unable any longer to oppose the flight of his men, or the flight 
<A NAME="530"></A>of his men, or the pursuit of the enemy, his body all covered with wounds, 
<A NAME="531"></A>and his soul no less wounded with grief, sat himself down upon a stone, 
<A NAME="532"></A>expecting the kindness of a despatching blow. His face was so disfigured, 
<A NAME="533"></A>and all his person so stained with blood, that his very friends and domestics 
<A NAME="534"></A>passing by knew him not. At last Cornelius Lentulus, a young man of patrician 
<A NAME="535"></A>race, perceiving who he was, alighted from his horse, and, tendering it 
<A NAME="536"></A>to him, desired him to get up and save a life so necessary to the safety 
<A NAME="537"></A>of the commonwealth, which, at this time, would dearly want so great a 
<A NAME="538"></A>captain. But nothing could prevail upon him to accept of the offer; he 
<A NAME="539"></A>obliged young Lentulus, with tears in his eyes, to remount his horse; then 
<A NAME="540"></A>standing up, he gave him his hand, and commanded him to tell Fabius Maximus 
<A NAME="541"></A>that Aemilius Paulus had followed his directions to his very last, and 
<A NAME="542"></A>had not in the least deviated from those measures which were agreed between 
<A NAME="543"></A>them; but that it was his hard fate to be overpowered by Varro in the first 
<A NAME="544"></A>place, and secondly by Hannibal. Having despatched Lentulus with this commission, 
<A NAME="545"></A>he marked where the slaughter was greatest, and there threw himself upon 
<A NAME="546"></A>the swords of the enemy. In this battle it is reported that fifty thousand 
<A NAME="547"></A>Romans were slain, four thousand prisoners taken in the field, and ten 
<A NAME="548"></A>thousand in the camp of both consuls.
<A NAME="549"></A><BR><BR>The friends of Hannibal earnestly persuaded him to follow up his 
<A NAME="550"></A>victory, and pursue the flying Romans into the very gates of Rome, assuring 
<A NAME="551"></A>him that in five days' time he might sup in the Capitol; nor is it easy 
<A NAME="552"></A>to imagine what consideration hindered him from it. It would seem rather 
<A NAME="553"></A>than some supernatural or divine intervention caused the hesitation and 
<A NAME="554"></A>timidity which he now displayed, and which made Barcas, a Carthaginian, 
<A NAME="555"></A>tell him with indignation, "You know, Hannibal, how to gain a victory, 
<A NAME="556"></A>but not how to use it." Yet it produced a marvellous revolution in his 
<A NAME="557"></A>affairs; he, who hitherto had not one town, market, or seaport in his possession, 
<A NAME="558"></A>who had nothing for the subsistence of his men but what he pillaged from 
<A NAME="559"></A>day to day, who had no place of retreat or basis of operation, but was 
<A NAME="560"></A>roving, as it were, with a huge troop of banditti, now became master of 
<A NAME="561"></A>the best provinces and towns of Italy, and of Capua itself, next to Rome 
<A NAME="562"></A>the most flourishing and opulent city, all which came over to him, and 
<A NAME="563"></A>submitted to his authority.
<A NAME="564"></A><BR><BR>It is the saying of Euripides, that "a man is in ill-case when 
<A NAME="565"></A>he must try a friend," and so neither, it would seem, is a state in a good 
<A NAME="566"></A>one, when it needs an able general. And so it was with the Romans; the 
<A NAME="567"></A>counsels and actions of Fabius, which, before the battle, they had branded 
<A NAME="568"></A>as cowardice and fear, now, in the other extreme, they accounted to have 
<A NAME="569"></A>been more than human wisdom; as though nothing but a divine power of intellect 
<A NAME="570"></A>could have seen so far, and foretold contrary to the judgment of all others, 
<A NAME="571"></A>a result which, even now it had arrived, was hardly credible. In him, therefore, 
<A NAME="572"></A>they placed their whole remaining hopes; his wisdom was the sacred altar 
<A NAME="573"></A>and temple to which they fled for refuge, and his counsels, more than anything, 
<A NAME="574"></A>preserved them from dispersing and deserting their city, as in the time 
<A NAME="575"></A>when the Gauls took possession of Rome. He, whom they esteemed fearful 
<A NAME="576"></A>and pusillanimous when they were, as they thought, in a prosperous condition 
<A NAME="577"></A>was now the only man, in this general and unbounded dejection and confusion, 
<A NAME="578"></A>who showed no fear, but walked the streets with an assured and serene countenance, 
<A NAME="579"></A>addressed his fellow-citizens, checked the women's lamentations, and the 
<A NAME="580"></A>public gatherings of those who wanted thus to vent their sorrows. He caused 
<A NAME="581"></A>the senate to meet, he heartened up the magistrates, and was himself as 
<A NAME="582"></A>the soul and life of every office.
<A NAME="583"></A><BR><BR>He placed guards at the gates of the city to stop the frightened 
<A NAME="584"></A>multitude from flying; he regulated and confined their mournings for their 
<A NAME="585"></A>slain friends, both as to time and place; ordering that each family should 
<A NAME="586"></A>perform such observances within private walls, and that they should continue 
<A NAME="587"></A>only the space of one month, and then the whole city should be purified. 
<A NAME="588"></A>The feast of Ceres happening to fall within this time, it was decreed that 
<A NAME="589"></A>the solemnity should be intermitted, lest the fewness, and the sorrowful 
<A NAME="590"></A>countenance of those who should celebrate it, might too much expose to 
<A NAME="591"></A>the people the greatness of their loss; besides that, the worship most 
<A NAME="592"></A>acceptable to the gods is that which comes from cheerful hearts. But those 
<A NAME="593"></A>rites which were proper for appeasing their anger, and procuring auspicious 
<A NAME="594"></A>signs and presages, were by the direction of the augurs carefully performed. 
<A NAME="595"></A>Fabius Pictor, a near kinsman to Maximus, was sent to consult the oracle 
<A NAME="596"></A>of Delphi; and about the same time, two vestals having been detected to 
<A NAME="597"></A>have been violated, the one killed herself, and the other, according to 
<A NAME="598"></A>custom, was buried alive.
<A NAME="599"></A><BR><BR>Above all, let us admire the high spirit and equanimity of this 
<A NAME="600"></A>Roman commonwealth; that when the consul Varro came beaten and flying home, 
<A NAME="601"></A>full of shame and humiliation, after he had so disgracefully and calamitously 
<A NAME="602"></A>managed their affairs, yet the whole senate and people went forth to meet 
<A NAME="603"></A>him at the gates of the city, and received him with honour and respect. 
<A NAME="604"></A>And, silence being commanded, the magistrates and chief of the senate, 
<A NAME="605"></A>Fabius amongst them, commended him before the people, because he did not 
<A NAME="606"></A>despair of the safety of the commonwealth, after so great a loss, but was 
<A NAME="607"></A>come to take the government into his hands, to execute the laws, and aid 
<A NAME="608"></A>his fellow-citizens in their prospect of future deliverance.
<A NAME="609"></A><BR><BR>When word was brought to Rome that Hannibal, after the fight, had 
<A NAME="610"></A>marched with his army into other parts of Italy, the hearts of the Romans 
<A NAME="611"></A>began to revive, and they proceeded to send out generals and armies. The 
<A NAME="612"></A>most distinguished commands were held by Fabius Maximus and Claudius Marcellus, 
<A NAME="613"></A>both generals of great fame, though upon opposite grounds. For Marcellus, 
<A NAME="614"></A>as we have set forth in his life, was a man of action and high spirit, 
<A NAME="615"></A>ready and bold with his own hand, and, as Homer describes his warriors, 
<A NAME="616"></A>fierce, and delighting in fights. Boldness, enterprise, and dating to match 
<A NAME="617"></A>those of Hannibal, constituted his tactics, and marked his engagements. 
<A NAME="618"></A>But Fabius adhered to his former principles, still persuaded that, by following 
<A NAME="619"></A>close and not fighting him, Hannibal and his army would at last be tried 
<A NAME="620"></A>out and consumed, like a wrestler in too high condition, whose very excess 
<A NAME="621"></A>of strength makes him the more likely suddenly to give way and lose it. 
<A NAME="622"></A>Posidonius tells us that the Romans called Marcellus their sword, and Fabius 
<A NAME="623"></A>their buckler; and that the vigour of the one, mixed with the steadiness 
<A NAME="624"></A>of the other, made a happy compound that proved the salvation of Rome. 
<A NAME="625"></A>So that Hannibal found by experience that encountering the one, he met 
<A NAME="626"></A>with a rapid, impetuous river, which drove him back, and still made some 
<A NAME="627"></A>breach upon him; and by the other, though silently and quietly passing 
<A NAME="628"></A>by him, he was insensibly washed away and consumed; and, at last, was brought 
<A NAME="629"></A>to this, that he dreaded Marcellus when he was in motion, and Fabius when 
<A NAME="630"></A>he sat still. During the whole course of this war, he had still to do with 
<A NAME="631"></A>one or both of these generals; for each of them was five times consul, 
<A NAME="632"></A>and, as praetors or proconsuls or consuls, they had always a part in the 
<A NAME="633"></A>government of the army, till, at last, Marcellus fell into the trap which 
<A NAME="634"></A>Hannibal had laid for him, and was killed in his fifth consulship. But 
<A NAME="635"></A>all his craft and subtlety were unsuccessful upon Fabius, who only once 
<A NAME="636"></A>was in some danger of being caught, when counterfeit letters came to him 
<A NAME="637"></A>from the principal inhabitants of Metapontum, with promises to deliver 
<A NAME="638"></A>up their town if he would come before it with his army, and intimations 
<A NAME="639"></A>that they should expect him. This train had almost drawn him in; he resolved 
<A NAME="640"></A>to march to them with part of his army, and was diverted only by consulting 
<A NAME="641"></A>the omens of the birds, which he found to be inauspicious; and not long 
<A NAME="642"></A>after it was discovered that the letters had been forged by Hannibal, who, 
<A NAME="643"></A>for his reception, had laid an ambush to entertain him. This, perhaps, 
<A NAME="644"></A>we must rather attribute to the favour of the gods than to the prudence 
<A NAME="645"></A>of Fabius.
<A NAME="646"></A><BR><BR>In preserving the towns and allies from revolt by fair and gentle 
<A NAME="647"></A>treatment, and in not using rigour, or showing a suspicion upon every light 
<A NAME="648"></A>suggestion, his conduct was remarkable. It is told of him, that being informed 
<A NAME="649"></A>of a certain Marsian, eminent for courage and good birth, who had been 
<A NAME="650"></A>speaking underhand with some of the soldiers about deserting, Fabius was 
<A NAME="651"></A>so far from using severity against him, that he called for him, and told 
<A NAME="652"></A>him he was sensible of the neglect that had been shown to his merit and 
<A NAME="653"></A>good service, which, he said, was a great fault in the commanders who reward 
<A NAME="654"></A>more by favour than by desert; "but henceforth, whenever you are aggrieved," 
<A NAME="655"></A>said Fabius, "I shall consider it your fault, if you apply yourself to 
<A NAME="656"></A>any one but to me;" and when he had so spoken, he bestowed an excellent 
<A NAME="657"></A>horse, and other presents upon him; and, from that time forwards, there 
<A NAME="658"></A>was not a faithfuller and more trusty man in the whole army. With good 
<A NAME="659"></A>reason he judged, that, if those who have the government of horses and 
<A NAME="660"></A>dogs endeavour by gentle usage to cure their angry and untractable tempers, 
<A NAME="661"></A>rather than by cruelty and beating, much more should those who haze the 
<A NAME="662"></A>command of men try to bring them to order and discipline by the mildest 
<A NAME="663"></A>and fairest means, and not treat them worse than gardeners do those wild 
<A NAME="664"></A>plants, which, with care and attention, lose gradually the savageness of 
<A NAME="665"></A>their nature, and bear excellent fruit.
<A NAME="666"></A><BR><BR>At another time, some of his officers informed him that one of 
<A NAME="667"></A>their men was very often absent from his place, and out at nights; he asked 
<A NAME="668"></A>them what kind of man he was; they all answered, that the whole army had 
<A NAME="669"></A>not a better man, that he was a native of Lucania, and proceeded to speak 
<A NAME="670"></A>of several actions which they had seen him perform. Fabius made strict 
<A NAME="671"></A>inquiry, and discovered at last that these frequent excursions which he 
<A NAME="672"></A>ventured upon were to visit a young girl, with whom he was in love. Upon 
<A NAME="673"></A>which he gave private order to some of his men to find out the woman and 
<A NAME="674"></A>secretly convey her into his own tent; and then sent for the Lucanian, 
<A NAME="675"></A>and, calling him aside, told him, that he very well knew how often he had 
<A NAME="676"></A>been out away from the camp at night, which was a capital transgression 
<A NAME="677"></A>against military discipline and the Roman laws, but he knew also how brave 
<A NAME="678"></A>he was, and the good services he had done; therefore, in consideration 
<A NAME="679"></A>of them, he was willing to forgive him his fault; but to keep him in good 
<A NAME="680"></A>order, he was resolved to place one over him to be his keeper, who should 
<A NAME="681"></A>be accountable for his good behaviour. Having said this, he produced the 
<A NAME="682"></A>woman, and told the soldier, terrified and amazed at the adventure, "This 
<A NAME="683"></A>is the person who must answer for you; and by your future behaviour we 
<A NAME="684"></A>shall see whether your night rambles were on account of love, or for any 
<A NAME="685"></A>other worse design."
<A NAME="686"></A><BR><BR>Another passage there was, something of the same kind, which gained 
<A NAME="687"></A>him possession of Tarentum. There was a young Tarentine in the army that 
<A NAME="688"></A>had a sister in Tarentum, then in possession of the enemy, who entirely 
<A NAME="689"></A>loved her brother, and wholly depended upon him. He, being informed that 
<A NAME="690"></A>a certain Bruttian, whom Hannibal had made a commander of the garrison, 
<A NAME="691"></A>was deeply in love with his sister, conceived hopes that he might possibly 
<A NAME="692"></A>turn it to the advantage of the Romans. And having first communicated his 
<A NAME="693"></A>design to Fabius, he left the army as a deserter in show, and went over 
<A NAME="694"></A>to Tarentum. The first days passed, and the Bruttian abstained from visiting 
<A NAME="695"></A>the sister; for neither of them knew that the brother had notice of the 
<A NAME="696"></A>amour between them. The young Tarentine, however, took an occasion to tell 
<A NAME="697"></A>his sister how he had heard that a man of station and authority had made 
<A NAME="698"></A>his addresses to her, and desired her, therefore, to tell him who it was; 
<A NAME="699"></A>"for," said he, "if he be a man that has bravery and reputation, it matters 
<A NAME="700"></A>not what countryman he is, since at this time the sword mingles all nations, 
<A NAME="701"></A>and makes them equal; compulsion makes all things honourable; and in a 
<A NAME="702"></A>time when right is weak, we may be thankful if might assumes a form of 
<A NAME="703"></A>gentleness." Upon this the woman sends for her friend, and makes the brother 
<A NAME="704"></A>and him acquainted; and whereas she henceforth showed more countenance 
<A NAME="705"></A>to her lover than formerly, in the same degrees that her kindness increased, 
<A NAME="706"></A>his friendship, also, with the brother advanced. So that at last our Tarentine 
<A NAME="707"></A>thought this Bruttian officer well enough prepared to receive the offers 
<A NAME="708"></A>he had to make him, and that it would be easy for a mercenary man, who 
<A NAME="709"></A>was in love, to accept, upon the terms proposed, the large rewards promised 
<A NAME="710"></A>by Fabius. In conclusion, the bargain was struck, and the promise made 
<A NAME="711"></A>of delivering the town. This is the common tradition, though some relate 
<A NAME="712"></A>the story otherwise, and say, that this woman, by whom the Bruttian was 
<A NAME="713"></A>inveigled to betray the town, was not a native of Tarentum, but a Bruttian 
<A NAME="714"></A>born, and was kept by Fabius as his concubine; and being a countrywoman 
<A NAME="715"></A>and an acquaintance of the Bruttian governor, he privately sent her to 
<A NAME="716"></A>him to corrupt him.
<A NAME="717"></A><BR><BR>Whilst these matters were thus in process, to draw off Hannibal 
<A NAME="718"></A>from scenting the design, Fabius sends orders to the garrison in Rhegium, 
<A NAME="719"></A>that they should waste and spoil the Bruttian country, and should also 
<A NAME="720"></A>lay siege to Caulonia, and storm the place with all their might. These 
<A NAME="721"></A>were a body of eight thousand men, the worst of the Roman army, who had 
<A NAME="722"></A>most of them been runaways, and had been brought home by Marcellus from 
<A NAME="723"></A>Sicily, in dishonour, so that the loss of them would not be any great grief 
<A NAME="724"></A>to the Romans. Fabius, therefore, threw out these men as a bait for Hannibal, 
<A NAME="725"></A>to divert him from Tarentum; who instantly caught at it, and led his forces 
<A NAME="726"></A>to Caulonia; in the meantime, Fabius sat down before Tarentum. On the sixth 
<A NAME="727"></A>day of the siege, the young Tarentine slips by night out of the town, and, 
<A NAME="728"></A>having carefully observed the place where the Bruttian commander, according 
<A NAME="729"></A>to agreement, was to admit the Romans, gave an account of the whole matter 
<A NAME="730"></A>to Fabius; who thought it not safe to rely wholly upon the plot, but, while 
<A NAME="731"></A>proceeding with secrecy to the post, gave order for a general assault to 
<A NAME="732"></A>be made on the other side of the town, both by land and sea. This being 
<A NAME="733"></A>accordingly executed, while the Tarentines hurried to defend the town on 
<A NAME="734"></A>the side attacked, Fabius received the signal from the Bruttian, scaled 
<A NAME="735"></A>the walls, and entered the town unopposed.
<A NAME="736"></A><BR><BR>Here, we must confess, ambition seems to have overcome him. To 
<A NAME="737"></A>make it appear to the world that he had taken Tarentum by force and his 
<A NAME="738"></A>own prowess, and not by treachery, he commanded his men to kill the Bruttians 
<A NAME="739"></A>before all others; yet he did not succeed in establishing the impression 
<A NAME="740"></A>he desired, but merely gained the character of perfidy and cruelty. Many 
<A NAME="741"></A>of the Tarentines were also killed, and thirty thousand of them were sold 
<A NAME="742"></A>for slaves; the army had the plunder of the town, and there was brought 
<A NAME="743"></A>into the treasury three thousand talents. Whilst they were carrying off 
<A NAME="744"></A>everything else as plunder, the officer who took the inventory asked what 
<A NAME="745"></A>should be done with their gods, meaning the pictures and statues; Fabius 
<A NAME="746"></A>answered, "Let us leave their angry gods to the Tarentines." Nevertheless, 
<A NAME="747"></A>he removed the colossal statue of Hercules, and had it set up in the Capitol, 
<A NAME="748"></A>with one of himself on horseback, in brass, near it; proceedings very different 
<A NAME="749"></A>from those of Marcellus on a like occasion, and which, indeed, very much 
<A NAME="750"></A>set off in the eyes of the world his clemency and humanity, as appears 
<A NAME="751"></A>in the account of his life.
<A NAME="752"></A><BR><BR>Hannibal, it is said, was within five miles of Tarentum, when he 
<A NAME="753"></A>was informed that the town was taken. He said openly, "Rome then has also 
<A NAME="754"></A>got a Hannibal; as we won Tarentum, so have we lost it." And, in private 
<A NAME="755"></A>with some of his confidants, he told them, for the first time, that he 
<A NAME="756"></A>always thought it difficult, but now he held it impossible, with the forces 
<A NAME="757"></A>he then had, to master Italy.
<A NAME="758"></A><BR><BR>Upon this success, Fabius had a triumph decreed him at Rome, much 
<A NAME="759"></A>more splendid than his first; they looked upon him now as a champion who 
<A NAME="760"></A>had learned to cope with his antagonist, and could now easily foil his 
<A NAME="761"></A>arts and prove his best skill ineffectual. And, indeed, the army of Hannibal 
<A NAME="762"></A>was at this time partly worn away with continual action, and partly weakened 
<A NAME="763"></A>and become dissolute with overabundance and luxury. Marcus Livius, who 
<A NAME="764"></A>was governor of Tarentum when it was betrayed to Hannibal, and then retired 
<A NAME="765"></A>into the citadel, which he kept till the town was retaken, was annoyed 
<A NAME="766"></A>at these honours and distinctions, and, on one occasion, openly declared 
<A NAME="767"></A>in the senate, that by his resistance, more than by any action of Fabius, 
<A NAME="768"></A>Tarentum had been recovered; on which Fabius laughingly replied: "You say 
<A NAME="769"></A>very true, for if Marcus Livius had not lost Tarentum, Fabius Maximus had 
<A NAME="770"></A>never recovered it." The people, amongst other marks of gratitude, gave 
<A NAME="771"></A>his son the consulship of the next year; shortly after whose entrance upon 
<A NAME="772"></A>his office, there being some business on foot about provision for the war, 
<A NAME="773"></A>his father, either by reason of age and infirmity, or perhaps out of design 
<A NAME="774"></A>to try his son, came up to him on horseback. While he was still at a distance, 
<A NAME="775"></A>the young consul observed it, and bade one of his lictors command his father 
<A NAME="776"></A>to alight, and tell him if he had any business with the consul, he should 
<A NAME="777"></A>come on foot. The standers-by seemed offended at the imperiousness of the 
<A NAME="778"></A>son towards a father so venerable for his age and his authority, and turned 
<A NAME="779"></A>their eyes in silence towards Fabius. He, however, instantly alighted from 
<A NAME="780"></A>his horse, and with open arms came up, almost running, and embraced his 
<A NAME="781"></A>son, saying, "Yes, my son, you do well, and understand well what authority 
<A NAME="782"></A>you have received, and over whom you are to use it. This was the way by 
<A NAME="783"></A>which we and our forefathers advanced the dignity of Rome, preferring ever 
<A NAME="784"></A>her honour and service to our own fathers and children."
<A NAME="785"></A><BR><BR>And, in fact, it is told that the great-grandfather of our Fabius, 
<A NAME="786"></A>who was undoubtedly the greatest man of Rome in his time, both in reputation 
<A NAME="787"></A>and authority, who had been five times consul, and had been honoured with 
<A NAME="788"></A>several triumphs for victories obtained by him, took pleasure in serving 
<A NAME="789"></A>as lieutenant under his own son, when he went as consul to his command. 
<A NAME="790"></A>And when afterwards his son had a triumph bestowed upon him for his good 
<A NAME="791"></A>service, the old man followed, on horseback, his triumphant chariot, as 
<A NAME="792"></A>one of his attendants; and made it his glory, that while he really was, 
<A NAME="793"></A>and was acknowledged to be, the greatest man in Rome, and held a father's 
<A NAME="794"></A>full power over his son, he yet submitted himself to the laws and the 
<A NAME="795"></A>magistrate.
<A NAME="796"></A><BR><BR>But the praises of our Fabius are not bounded here. He afterwards 
<A NAME="797"></A>lost his son, and was remarkable for bearing the loss with the moderation 
<A NAME="798"></A>becoming a pious father and a wise man, and as it was the custom amongst 
<A NAME="799"></A>the Romans, upon the death of any illustrious person, to have a funeral 
<A NAME="800"></A>oration recited by some of the nearest relations, he took upon himself 
<A NAME="801"></A>that office, and delivered a speech in the forum, which he committed afterwards 
<A NAME="802"></A>to writing.
<A NAME="803"></A><BR><BR>After Cornelius Scipio, who was sent into Spain, had driven the 
<A NAME="804"></A>Carthaginians, defeated by him in many battles, out of the country, and 
<A NAME="805"></A>had gained over to Rome many towns and nations with large resources, he 
<A NAME="806"></A>was received at his coming home with unexampled joy and acclamation of 
<A NAME="807"></A>the people; who, to show their gratitude, elected him consul for the year 
<A NAME="808"></A>ensuing. Knowing what high expectation they had of him, he thought the 
<A NAME="809"></A>occupation of contesting Italy with Hannibal a mere old man's employment, 
<A NAME="810"></A>and proposed no less a task to himself than to make Carthage the seat of 
<A NAME="811"></A>the war, fill Africa with arms and devastation, and so oblige Hannibal, 
<A NAME="812"></A>instead of invading the countries of others, to draw back and defend his 
<A NAME="813"></A>own. And to this end he proceeded to exert all the influence he had with 
<A NAME="814"></A>the people. Fabius, on the other side, opposed the undertaking with all 
<A NAME="815"></A>his might, alarming the city, and telling them that nothing but the temerity 
<A NAME="816"></A>of a hot young man could inspire them with such dangerous counsels, and 
<A NAME="817"></A>sparing no means, by word or deed, to prevent it. He prevailed with the 
<A NAME="818"></A>senate to espouse his sentiments; but the common people thought that he 
<A NAME="819"></A>envied the fame of Scipio, and that he was afraid lest this young conqueror 
<A NAME="820"></A>should achieve some great and noble exploit, and have the glory, perhaps, 
<A NAME="821"></A>of driving Hannibal out of Italy, or even of ending the war, which had 
<A NAME="822"></A>for so many years continued and been protracted under his 
<A NAME="823"></A>management.
<A NAME="824"></A><BR><BR>To say the truth, when Fabius first opposed this project of Scipio, 
<A NAME="825"></A>he probably did it out of caution and prudence, in consideration only of 
<A NAME="826"></A>the public safety, and of the danger which the commonwealth might incur; 
<A NAME="827"></A>but when he found Scipio every day increasing in the esteem of the people, 
<A NAME="828"></A>rivalry and ambition led him further, and made him violent and personal 
<A NAME="829"></A>in his opposition. For he even applied to Crassus, the colleague of Scipio, 
<A NAME="830"></A>and urged him not to yield the command to Scipio, but that, if his inclinations 
<A NAME="831"></A>were for it, he should himself in person lead the army to Carthage. He 
<A NAME="832"></A>also hindered the giving money to Scipio for the war; so that he was forced 
<A NAME="833"></A>to raise it upon his own credit and interest from the cities of Etruria, 
<A NAME="834"></A>which were extremely attached to him. On the other side, Crassus would 
<A NAME="835"></A>not stir against him, nor remove out of Italy, being, in his own nature, 
<A NAME="836"></A>averse to all contention, and also having, by his office of high priest, 
<A NAME="837"></A>religious duties to retain him. Fabius, therefore, tried other ways to 
<A NAME="838"></A>oppose the design; he impeded the levies, and he declaimed, both in the 
<A NAME="839"></A>senate and to the people, that Scipio was not only himself flying from 
<A NAME="840"></A>Hannibal, but was also endeavouring to drain Italy of all its forces, and 
<A NAME="841"></A>to spirit away the youth of the country to a foreign war, leaving behind 
<A NAME="842"></A>them their parents, wives, and children, and the city itself, a defenceless 
<A NAME="843"></A>prey to the conquering and undefeated enemy at their doors. With this he 
<A NAME="844"></A>so far alarmed the people, that at last they would only allow Scipio for 
<A NAME="845"></A>the war the legions which were in Sicily, and three hundred, whom he particularly 
<A NAME="846"></A>trusted, of those men who had served with him in Spain. In these transactions, 
<A NAME="847"></A>Fabius seems to have followed the dictates of his own wary 
<A NAME="848"></A>temper.
<A NAME="849"></A><BR><BR>But, after that Scipio was gone over into Africa, when news almost 
<A NAME="850"></A>immediately came to Rome of wonderful exploits and victories, of which 
<A NAME="851"></A>the fame was confirmed by the spoils he sent home; of a Numidian king taken 
<A NAME="852"></A>prisoner; of a vast slaughter of their men; of two camps of the enemy burnt 
<A NAME="853"></A>and destroyed, and in them a great quantity of arms and horses; and when, 
<A NAME="854"></A>hereupon, the Carthaginians were compelled to send envoys to Hannibal to 
<A NAME="855"></A>call him home, and leave his idle hopes in Italy, to defend Carthage; when, 
<A NAME="856"></A>for such eminent and transcending services, the whole people of Rome cried 
<A NAME="857"></A>up and extolled the actions of Scipio; even then, Fabius contended that 
<A NAME="858"></A>a successor should be sent in his place, alleging for it only the old reason 
<A NAME="859"></A>of the mutability of fortune, as if she would be weary of long favouring 
<A NAME="860"></A>the same person. With this language many did begin to feel offended; it 
<A NAME="861"></A>seemed to be morosity and ill-will, the pusillanimity of old age, or a 
<A NAME="862"></A>fear, that had now become exaggerated, of the skill of Hannibal. Nay, when 
<A NAME="863"></A>Hannibal had put his army on shipboard, and taken his leave of Italy, Fabius 
<A NAME="864"></A>still could not forbear to oppose and disturb the universal joy of Rome, 
<A NAME="865"></A>expressing his fears and apprehensions, telling them that the commonwealth 
<A NAME="866"></A>was never in more danger than now, and that Hannibal was a more formidable 
<A NAME="867"></A>enemy under the walls of Carthage than ever he had been in Italy; that 
<A NAME="868"></A>it would be fatal to Rome whenever Scipio should encounter his victorious 
<A NAME="869"></A>army, still warm with the blood of so many Roman generals, dictators, and 
<A NAME="870"></A>consuls slain. And the people were, in some degree, startled with these 
<A NAME="871"></A>declamations, and were brought to believe that the further off Hannibal 
<A NAME="872"></A>was, the nearer was their danger. Scipio, however, shortly afterwards fought 
<A NAME="873"></A>Hannibal, and utterly defeated him, humbled the pride of Carthage beneath 
<A NAME="874"></A>his feet, gave his countrymen joy and exultation beyond all their hopes, 
<A NAME="875"></A>and-
<A NAME="876"></A><BR><BR>"Long shaken on the seas restored the state."
<A NAME="877"></A><BR><BR>Fabius Maximus, however, did not live to see the prosperous end 
<A NAME="878"></A>of this war, and the final overthrow of Hannibal, nor to rejoice in the 
<A NAME="879"></A>re-established happiness and security of the commonwealth; for about the 
<A NAME="880"></A>time that Hannibal left Italy, he fell sick and died. At Thebes, Epaminondas 
<A NAME="881"></A>died so poor that he was buried at the public charge; one small iron coin 
<A NAME="882"></A>was all, it is said, that was found in his house. Fabius did not need this, 
<A NAME="883"></A>but the people, as a mark of their affection, defrayed the expenses of 
<A NAME="884"></A>his funeral by a private contribution from each citizen of the smallest 
<A NAME="885"></A>piece of coin; thus owning him their common father, and making his end 
<A NAME="886"></A>no less honourable than his life.
