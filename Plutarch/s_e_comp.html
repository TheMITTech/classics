<A NAME="2"></A><BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>These are the most remarkable passages that are come to our knowledge concerning 
<A NAME="11"></A>Eumenes and Sertorius. In comparing their lives, we may observe that this 
<A NAME="12"></A>was common to them both; that being aliens, strangers, and banished men, 
<A NAME="13"></A>they came to be commanders of powerful forces, and had the leading of numerous 
<A NAME="14"></A>and warlike armies, made up of divers nations. This was peculiar to Sertorius, 
<A NAME="15"></A>that the chief command was, by his whole party, freely yielded to him, 
<A NAME="16"></A>as to the person of the greatest merit and renown, whereas Eumenes had 
<A NAME="17"></A>many who contested the office with him, and only by his actions obtained 
<A NAME="18"></A>the superiority. They followed the one honestly, out of desire to be commanded 
<A NAME="19"></A>by him; they submitted themselves to the other for their own security, 
<A NAME="20"></A>because they could not command themselves. The one, being a Roman, was 
<A NAME="21"></A>the general of the Spaniards and Lusitanians, who for many years had been 
<A NAME="22"></A>under the subjection of Rome; and the other, a Chersonesian, who was chief 
<A NAME="23"></A>commander of the Macedonians, who were the great conquerors of mankind, 
<A NAME="24"></A>and were at that time subduing the world. Sertorius, being already in high 
<A NAME="25"></A>esteem for his former services in the wars and his abilities in the senate, 
<A NAME="26"></A>was advanced to the dignity of a general; whereas Eumenes obtained this 
<A NAME="27"></A>honour from the office of a writer, or secretary, in which he had been 
<A NAME="28"></A>despised. Nor did he only at first rise from inferior opportunities, but 
<A NAME="29"></A>afterwards, also, met with greater impediments in the progress of his authority, 
<A NAME="30"></A>and that not only from those who publicly resisted him, but from many others 
<A NAME="31"></A>that privately conspired against him. It was much otherwise with Sertorius, 
<A NAME="32"></A>not one of whose party publicly opposed him, only late in life, and secretly, 
<A NAME="33"></A>a few of his acquaintance entered into a conspiracy against him. Sertorius 
<A NAME="34"></A>put an end to his dangers as often as he was victorious in the field, whereas 
<A NAME="35"></A>the victories of Eumenes were the beginning of his perils, through the 
<A NAME="36"></A>malice of those that envied him.
<A NAME="37"></A><BR><BR>Their deeds in war were equal and parallel, but their general inclinations 
<A NAME="38"></A>different. Eumenes naturally loved war and contention, but Sertorius esteemed 
<A NAME="39"></A>peace and tranquillity; when Eumenes might have lived in safety, with honour, 
<A NAME="40"></A>if he would have quietly retired out of their way, he persisted in a dangerous 
<A NAME="41"></A>contest with the greatest of the Macedonian leaders; but Sertorius, who 
<A NAME="42"></A>was unwilling to trouble himself with any public disturbances, was forced, 
<A NAME="43"></A>for the safety of his person, to make war against those who would not suffer 
<A NAME="44"></A>him to live in peace. If Eumenes could have contented himself with the 
<A NAME="45"></A>second place, Antigonus, freed from his competition for the first, would 
<A NAME="46"></A>have used him well, and shown him favour, whereas Pompey's friends would 
<A NAME="47"></A>never permit Sertorius so much as to live in quiet. The one made war of 
<A NAME="48"></A>his own accord, out of a desire for command; and the other was constrained 
<A NAME="49"></A>to accept of command to defend himself from war that was made against him. 
<A NAME="50"></A>Eumenes was certainly a true lover of war, for he preferred his covetous 
<A NAME="51"></A>ambition before his own security; but Sertorius was truly warlike, who 
<A NAME="52"></A>procured his own safety by the success of his arms.
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR>As to the manner of their deaths, it happened to one without the 
<A NAME="54"></A>least thought or surmise of it; but to the other when he suspected it daily; 
<A NAME="55"></A>which in the first argues an equitable temper, and a noble mind, not to 
<A NAME="56"></A>distrust his friends; but in the other it showed some infirmity of spirit, 
<A NAME="57"></A>for Eumenes intended to fly and was taken. The death of Sertorius dishonoured 
<A NAME="58"></A>not his life; he suffered that from his companions which none of his enemies 
<A NAME="59"></A>were ever able to perform. The other, not being able to deliver himself 
<A NAME="60"></A>before his imprisonment, being willing also to live in captivity, did neither 
<A NAME="61"></A>prevent nor expect his fate with honour or bravery; for by meanly supplicating 
<A NAME="62"></A>and petitioning, he made his enemy, that pretended only to have power over 
<A NAME="63"></A>his body, to be lord and master of his body and mind.
