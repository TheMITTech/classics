<A NAME="2"></A><BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>One might bless the end of Lucullus, which was so timed as to let him die 
<A NAME="11"></A>before the great revolution, which fate, by intestine wars, was already 
<A NAME="12"></A>effecting against the established government, and to close his life in 
<A NAME="13"></A>a free though troubled commonwealth. And in this, above all other things, 
<A NAME="14"></A>Cimon and he are alike. For he died also when Greece was as yet undisordered, 
<A NAME="15"></A>in its highest felicity; though in the field at the head of his army, not 
<A NAME="16"></A>recalled, nor out of his mind, nor sullying the glory of his wars, engagements, 
<A NAME="17"></A>and conquests, by making feastings and debauches seem the apparent end 
<A NAME="18"></A>and aim of them all; as Plato says scornfully of Orpheus, that he makes 
<A NAME="19"></A>an eternal debauch hereafter the reward of those who lived well here. Indeed, 
<A NAME="20"></A>ease and quiet, and the study of pleasant and speculative learning, to 
<A NAME="21"></A>an old man retiring from command and office, is a most suitable and becoming 
<A NAME="22"></A>solace; but to misguide virtuous actions to pleasure as their utmost end, 
<A NAME="23"></A>and as the conclusion of campaigns and commands, to keep the feast of Venus, 
<A NAME="24"></A>did not become the noble Academy, and the follower of Xenocrates, but rather 
<A NAME="25"></A>one that inclined to Epicurus. And this is one surprising point of contrast 
<A NAME="26"></A>between them; Cimon's youth was ill reputed and intemperate, Lucullus's 
<A NAME="27"></A>well disciplined and sober. Undoubtedly we must give the preference to 
<A NAME="28"></A>the change for good, for it argues the better nature, where vice declines 
<A NAME="29"></A>and virtue grows. Both had great wealth, but employed it in different ways; 
<A NAME="30"></A>and there is no comparison between the south wall of the acropolis built 
<A NAME="31"></A>by Cimon, and the chambers and galleries, with their sea-views, built at 
<A NAME="32"></A>Naples by Lucullus, out of the spoils of the barbarians. Neither can we 
<A NAME="33"></A>compare Cimon's popular and liberal table with the sumptuous oriental one 
<A NAME="34"></A>of Lucullus, the former receiving a great many guests every day at small 
<A NAME="35"></A>cost, and the latter expensively spread for a few men of pleasure, unless 
<A NAME="36"></A>you will say that different times made the alteration. For who can tell 
<A NAME="37"></A>but that Cimon, if he had retired in his old age from business and war 
<A NAME="38"></A>to quiet and solitude, might have lived a more luxurious and self-indulgent 
<A NAME="39"></A>life, as he was fond of wine and company, and accused, as has been said, 
<A NAME="40"></A>of laxity with women? The better pleasures gained in successful action 
<A NAME="41"></A>and effort leave the baser appetites no time or place, and make active 
<A NAME="42"></A>and heroic men forget them. Had but Lucullus ended his days in the field, 
<A NAME="43"></A>and in command, envy and detraction itself could never have accused him. 
<A NAME="44"></A>So much for their manner of life.
<A NAME="45"></A><BR><BR>In war, it is plain they were both soldiers of excellent conduct, 
<A NAME="46"></A>both at land and sea. But as in the games they honour those champions who 
<A NAME="47"></A>on the same day gain the garland, both in wrestling and in the pancratium, 
<A NAME="48"></A>with the name of "Victors and more," so Cimon, honouring Greece with a 
<A NAME="49"></A>sea and land victory on the same day, may claim a certain pre-eminence 
<A NAME="50"></A>among commanders. Lucullus received command from his country, whereas Cimon 
<A NAME="51"></A>brought it to his. He annexed the territories of enemies to her, who ruled 
<A NAME="52"></A>over confederates before, but Cimon made his country, which when he began 
<A NAME="53"></A>was a mere follower of others, both rule over confederates, and conquer 
<A NAME="54"></A>enemies too, forcing the Persians to relinquish the sea, and inducing the 
<A NAME="55"></A>Lacedaemonians to surrender their command. If it be the chiefest thing 
<A NAME="56"></A>in a general to obtain the obedience of his soldiers by good-will, Lucullus 
<A NAME="57"></A>was despised by his own army, but Cimon highly prized even by others. His 
<A NAME="58"></A>soldiers deserted the one, the confederates came over to the other. Lucullus 
<A NAME="59"></A>came home without the forces which he led out; Cimon, sent out at first 
<A NAME="60"></A>to serve as one confederate among others, returned home with authority 
<A NAME="61"></A>even over these also, having successfully effected for his city three most 
<A NAME="62"></A>difficult services, establishing peace with the enemy, dominion over confederates, 
<A NAME="63"></A>and concord with Lacedaemon. Both aiming to destroy great kingdoms, and 
<A NAME="64"></A>subdue all Asia, failed in their enterprise, Cimon by a simple piece of 
<A NAME="65"></A>ill-fortune, for he died when general, in the height of success; but Lucullus 
<A NAME="66"></A>no man can wholly acquit of being in fault with his soldiers, whether it 
<A NAME="67"></A>were he did not know, or would not comply with, the distastes and complaints 
<A NAME="68"></A>of his army, which brought him at last into such extreme unpopularity among 
<A NAME="69"></A>them. But did not Cimon also suffer like him in this? For the citizens 
<A NAME="70"></A>arraigned him, and did not leave off till they had banished him, that, 
<A NAME="71"></A>as Plato says, they might not hear him for the space of ten years. For 
<A NAME="72"></A>high and noble minds seldom please the vulgar, or are acceptable to them; 
<A NAME="73"></A>for the force they use to straighten their distorted actions gives the 
<A NAME="74"></A>same pain as surgeons' bandages do in bringing dislocated bones to their 
<A NAME="75"></A>natural position. Both of them, perhaps, come off pretty much with an equal 
<A NAME="76"></A>acquittal on this count.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>Lucullus very much outwent him in war, being the first Roman who 
<A NAME="78"></A>carried an army over Taurus, passed the Tigris, took and burned the royal 
<A NAME="79"></A>palaces of Asia in the sight of the kings, Tigranocerta, Cabira, Sinope, 
<A NAME="80"></A>and Nisibis, seizing and overwhelming the northern parts as far as the 
<A NAME="81"></A>Phasis, the east as far as Media, and making the South and Red Sea his 
<A NAME="82"></A>own through the kings of the Arabians. He shattered the power of the kings, 
<A NAME="83"></A>and narrowly missed their persons, while like wild beasts they fled away 
<A NAME="84"></A>into deserts and thick and impassable woods. In demonstration of this superiority, 
<A NAME="85"></A>we see that the Persians, as if no great harm had befallen them under Cimon, 
<A NAME="86"></A>soon after appeared in arms against the Greeks, and overcame and destroyed 
<A NAME="87"></A>their numerous forces in Egypt. But after Lucullus, Tigranes and Mithridates 
<A NAME="88"></A>were able to do nothing; the latter, being disabled and broken in the former 
<A NAME="89"></A>wars, never dared to show his army to Pompey outside the camp, but fled 
<A NAME="90"></A>away to Bosporus, and there died. Tigranes threw himself, naked and unarmed, 
<A NAME="91"></A>down before Pompey, and taking his crown from his head laid it at his feet, 
<A NAME="92"></A>complimenting Pompey with what was not his own, but, in real truth, the 
<A NAME="93"></A>conquest already effected by Lucullus. And when he received the ensigns 
<A NAME="94"></A>of majesty again, he was well pleased, evidently because he had forfeited 
<A NAME="95"></A>them before. And the commander, as the wrestler, is to be accounted to 
<A NAME="96"></A>have done most who leaves an adversary almost conquered for his successor. 
<A NAME="97"></A>Cimon moreover, when he took the command, found the power of the king broken, 
<A NAME="98"></A>and the spirits of the Persians humbled by their great defeats and incessant 
<A NAME="99"></A>routs under Themistocles, Pausanias, and Leontychides, and thus easily 
<A NAME="100"></A>overcame the bodies of men whose souls were quelled and defeated beforehand. 
<A NAME="101"></A>But Tigranes had never yet in many combats been beaten, and was flushed 
<A NAME="102"></A>with success when he engaged with Lucullus. There is no comparison between 
<A NAME="103"></A>the numbers which came against Lucullus and those subdued by Cimon. All 
<A NAME="104"></A>which things being rightly considered, it is a hard matter to give judgment. 
<A NAME="105"></A>For supernatural favour also appears to have attended both of them, directing 
<A NAME="106"></A>the one what to do, the other what to avoid, and thus they have, both of 
<A NAME="107"></A>them, so to say, the vote of the gods, to declare them noble and divine 
<A NAME="108"></A>characters.
