<BR>(died 46 B.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>The family of Cato derived its first lustre from his great-grandfather 
<A NAME="11"></A>Cato, whose virtue gained him such great reputation and authority among 
<A NAME="12"></A>the Romans, as we have written in his life.
<A NAME="13"></A><BR><BR>This Cato was, by the loss of both his parents, left an orphan, 
<A NAME="14"></A>together with his brother Caepio, and his sister Porcia. He had also a 
<A NAME="15"></A>half-sister, Servilia, by the mother's side. All these lived together, 
<A NAME="16"></A>and were bred up in the house of Livius Drusus, their uncle by the mother, 
<A NAME="17"></A>who, at that time, had a great share in the government, being a very eloquent 
<A NAME="18"></A>speaker, a man of the greatest temperance, and yielding in dignity to none 
<A NAME="19"></A>of the Romans.
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><BR>It is said of Cato that even from his infancy, in his speech, his 
<A NAME="21"></A>countenance, and all his childish pastimes, he discovered an inflexible 
<A NAME="22"></A>temper, unmoved by any passion, and firm in everything. He was resolute 
<A NAME="23"></A>in his purposes, much beyond the strength of his age, to go through with 
<A NAME="24"></A>whatever he undertook. He was rough and ungentle toward those that flattered 
<A NAME="25"></A>him, and still more unyielding to those who threatened him. It was difficult 
<A NAME="26"></A>to excite him to laughter, his countenance seldom relaxed even into a smile; 
<A NAME="27"></A>he was not quickly or easily provoked to anger, but if once incensed, he 
<A NAME="28"></A>was no less difficult to pacify.
<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR>When he began to learn, he proved dull, and slow to apprehend, 
<A NAME="30"></A>but of what he once received, his memory was remarkably tenacious. And 
<A NAME="31"></A>such in fact, we find generally to be the course of nature; men of fine 
<A NAME="32"></A>genius are readily reminded of things, but those who receive with most 
<A NAME="33"></A>pains and difficulty, remember best; every new thing they learn, being, 
<A NAME="34"></A>as it were, burnt and branded in on their minds. Cato's natural stubbornness 
<A NAME="35"></A>and slowness to be persuaded may also have made it more difficult for him 
<A NAME="36"></A>to be taught. For to learn is to submit to have something done to one; 
<A NAME="37"></A>and persuasion comes soonest to those who have least strength to resist 
<A NAME="38"></A>it. Hence young men are sooner persuaded than those that are more in years, 
<A NAME="39"></A>and sick men, than those that are well in health. In fine, where there 
<A NAME="40"></A>is least previous doubt and difficulty, the new impression is most easily 
<A NAME="41"></A>accepted. Yet Cato, they say, was very obedient to his preceptor, and would 
<A NAME="42"></A>do whatever he was commanded; but he would also ask the reason, and inquire 
<A NAME="43"></A>the cause of everything. And, indeed, his teacher was a very well-bred 
<A NAME="44"></A>man, more ready to instruct than to beat his scholars. His name was 
<A NAME="45"></A>Sarpedon.
<A NAME="46"></A><BR><BR>When Cato was a child, the allies of the Romans sued to be made 
<A NAME="47"></A>free citizens of Rome. Pompaedius Silo, one of their deputies, a brave 
<A NAME="48"></A>soldier and a man of great repute, who had contracted a friendship with 
<A NAME="49"></A>Drusus, lodged at his house for several days, in which time being grown 
<A NAME="50"></A>familiar with the children, "Well," said he to them, "will you entreat 
<A NAME="51"></A>your uncle to befriend us in our business?" Caepio, smiling, assented, 
<A NAME="52"></A>but Cato made no answer, only he looked steadfastly and fiercely on the 
<A NAME="53"></A>strangers. Then said Pompaedius, "And you, young sir, what say you to us? 
<A NAME="54"></A>will not you, as well as your brother, intercede with your uncle in our 
<A NAME="55"></A>behalf?" And when Cato continued to give no answer, by his silence and 
<A NAME="56"></A>his countenance seeming to deny their petition, Pompaedius snatched him 
<A NAME="57"></A>up to the window as if he would throw him out, and told him to consent, 
<A NAME="58"></A>or he would fling him down, and, speaking in a harsher tone, held his body 
<A NAME="59"></A>out of the window, and shook him several times. When Cato had suffered 
<A NAME="60"></A>this a good while, unmoved and unalarmed, Pompaedius, setting him down, 
<A NAME="61"></A>said in an undervoice to his friend, "What a blessing for Italy that he 
<A NAME="62"></A>is but a child! If he were a man, I believe we should not gain one voice 
<A NAME="63"></A>among the people." Another time, one of his relations, on his birthday, 
<A NAME="64"></A>invited Cato and some other children to supper, and some of the company 
<A NAME="65"></A>diverted themselves in a separate part of the house, and were at play, 
<A NAME="66"></A>the elder and the younger together, their sport being to act the pleadings 
<A NAME="67"></A>before the judges, accusing one another, and carrying away the condemned 
<A NAME="68"></A>to prison. Among these a very beautiful young child, being bound and carried 
<A NAME="69"></A>by a bigger into prison, cried out to Cato, who seeing what was going on, 
<A NAME="70"></A>presently ran to the door, and thrusting away those who stood there as 
<A NAME="71"></A>a guard, took out the child, and went home in anger, followed by some of 
<A NAME="72"></A>his companions.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>Cato at length grew so famous among them, that when Sylla designed 
<A NAME="74"></A>to exhibit the sacred game of young men riding courses on horseback, which 
<A NAME="75"></A>they called Troy, having gotten together the youth of good birth, he appointed 
<A NAME="76"></A>two for their leaders. One of them they accepted for his mother's sake, 
<A NAME="77"></A>being the son of Metella, the wife of Sylla; but as for the other, Sextus, 
<A NAME="78"></A>the nephew of Pompey, they would not be led by him, nor exercise under 
<A NAME="79"></A>him. Then Sylla asking whom they would have, they all cried out, Cato; 
<A NAME="80"></A>and Sextus willingly yielded the honour to him, as the more 
<A NAME="81"></A>worthy.
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR>Sylla, who was a friend of their family, sent at times for Cato 
<A NAME="83"></A>and his brother to see them and talk with them; a favour which he showed 
<A NAME="84"></A>to very few, after gaining his great power and authority. Sarpedon, full 
<A NAME="85"></A>of the advantage it would be, as well for the honour as the safety of his 
<A NAME="86"></A>scholars, would often bring Cato to wait upon Sylla at his house, which, 
<A NAME="87"></A>for the multitude of those that were being carried off in custody, and 
<A NAME="88"></A>tormented there, looked like a place of execution. Cato was then in his 
<A NAME="89"></A>fourteenth year, and seeing the heads of men said to be of great distinction 
<A NAME="90"></A>brought thither, and observing the secret sighs of those that were present, 
<A NAME="91"></A>he asked his preceptor, "Why does nobody kill this man?" "Because," said 
<A NAME="92"></A>he, "they fear him, child, more than they hate him." "Why, then," replied 
<A NAME="93"></A>Cato, "did you not give me a sword, that I might stab him, and free my 
<A NAME="94"></A>country from this slavery?" Sarpedon hearing this, and at the same time 
<A NAME="95"></A>seeing his countenance swelling with anger and determination, took care 
<A NAME="96"></A>thenceforward to watch him strictly, lest he should hazard any desperate 
<A NAME="97"></A>attempt.
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR>While he was yet very young, to some that asked him whom he loved 
<A NAME="99"></A>best, he answered, his brother. And being asked, whom next, he replied, 
<A NAME="100"></A>his brother, again. So likewise the third time, and still the same, till 
<A NAME="101"></A>they left off to ask any further. As he grew in age, this love to his brother 
<A NAME="102"></A>grew yet the stronger. When he was about twenty years old, he never supped, 
<A NAME="103"></A>never went out of town, nor into the forum, without Caepio. But when his 
<A NAME="104"></A>brother made use of precious ointments and perfumes, Cato declined them; 
<A NAME="105"></A>and he was, in all his habits, very strict and austere, so that when Caepio 
<A NAME="106"></A>was admired for his moderation and temperance, he would acknowledge that 
<A NAME="107"></A>indeed he might be accounted such, in comparison with some other men, "but," 
<A NAME="108"></A>said he, "when I compare myself with Cato, I find myself scarcely different 
<A NAME="109"></A>from Sippius," one at that time notorious for his luxurious and effeminate 
<A NAME="110"></A>living.
<A NAME="111"></A><BR><BR>Cato being made priest of Apollo, went to another house, took his 
<A NAME="112"></A>portion of their paternal inheritance, amounting to a hundred and twenty 
<A NAME="113"></A>talents, and began to live yet more strictly than before. Having gained 
<A NAME="114"></A>the intimate acquaintance of Antipater the Tyrian, the Stoic philosopher, 
<A NAME="115"></A>he devoted himself to the study, above everything, of moral and political 
<A NAME="116"></A>doctrine. And though possessed, as it were, by a kind of inspiration for 
<A NAME="117"></A>the pursuit of every virtue, yet what most of all virtue and excellence 
<A NAME="118"></A>fixed his affection was that steady and inflexible justice which is not 
<A NAME="119"></A>to be wrought upon by favour or compassion. He learned also the art of 
<A NAME="120"></A>speaking and debating in public, thinking that political philosophy, like 
<A NAME="121"></A>a great city, should maintain for its security the military and warlike 
<A NAME="122"></A>element. But he would never recite his exercises before company, nor was 
<A NAME="123"></A>he ever heard to declaim. And to one that told him men blamed his silence, 
<A NAME="124"></A>"But I hope not my life." he replied, "I will begin to speak, when I have 
<A NAME="125"></A>that to say which had not better be unsaid."
<A NAME="126"></A><BR><BR>The great Porcian Hall, as it was called, had been built and dedicated 
<A NAME="127"></A>to the public use by the old Cato, when aedile. Here the tribunes of the 
<A NAME="128"></A>people used to transact their business, and because one of the pillars 
<A NAME="129"></A>was thought to interfere with the convenience of their seats, they deliberated 
<A NAME="130"></A>whether it were best to remove it to another place, or to take it away. 
<A NAME="131"></A>This occasion first drew Cato, much against his will, into the forum; for 
<A NAME="132"></A>he opposed the demand of the tribunes, and in so doing gave a specimen 
<A NAME="133"></A>both of his courage and his powers of speaking, which gained him great 
<A NAME="134"></A>admiration. His speech had nothing youthful or refined in it, but was straightforward, 
<A NAME="135"></A>full of matter, and rough, at the same time that there was a certain grace 
<A NAME="136"></A>about his rough statements which won the attention; and the speaker's character, 
<A NAME="137"></A>showing itself in all he said, added to his severe language something that 
<A NAME="138"></A>excited feelings of natural pleasure and interest. His voice was full and 
<A NAME="139"></A>sounding, and sufficient to be heard by so great a multitude, and its vigour 
<A NAME="140"></A>and capacity of endurance quite indefatigable, for he often would speak 
<A NAME="141"></A>a whole day and never stop.
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR>When he had carried this cause, he betook himself again to study 
<A NAME="143"></A>and retirement. He employed himself in inuring his body to labour and violent 
<A NAME="144"></A>exercise; and habituated himself to go bareheaded in the hottest and the 
<A NAME="145"></A>coldest weather, and to walk on foot at all seasons. When he went on a 
<A NAME="146"></A>journey with any of his friends, though they were on horseback and he on 
<A NAME="147"></A>foot, yet he would often join now one, then another, and converse with 
<A NAME="148"></A>them on the way. In sickness the patience he showed in supporting, and 
<A NAME="149"></A>the abstinence he used for curing, his distempers were admirable. When 
<A NAME="150"></A>he had an ague, he would remain alone, and suffer nobody to see him, till 
<A NAME="151"></A>he began to recover, and found the fit was over. At supper, when he threw 
<A NAME="152"></A>dice for the choice of dishes, and lost, and the company offered him nevertheless 
<A NAME="153"></A>his choice, he declined to dispute, as he said, the decision of Venus. 
<A NAME="154"></A>At first, he was wont to drink only once after supper, and then go away; 
<A NAME="155"></A>but in process of time he grew to drink more, insomuch that oftentimes 
<A NAME="156"></A>he would continue till morning. This his friends explained by saying that 
<A NAME="157"></A>state affairs and public business took him up all day, and being desirous 
<A NAME="158"></A>of knowledge, he liked to pass the night at wine in the conversation of 
<A NAME="159"></A>philosophers. Hence, upon one Memmius saying in public, that Cato spent 
<A NAME="160"></A>whole nights in drinking, "You should add," replied Cicero, "that he spends 
<A NAME="161"></A>whole days in gambling." And in general Cato esteemed the customs and manners 
<A NAME="162"></A>of men at that time so corrupt, and a reformation in them so necessary, 
<A NAME="163"></A>that he thought it requisite, in many things, to go contrary to the ordinary 
<A NAME="164"></A>way of the world. Seeing the lightest and gayest purple was then most in 
<A NAME="165"></A>fashion, he would always wear that which was the nearest black; and he 
<A NAME="166"></A>would often go out of doors, after his morning meal, without either shoes 
<A NAME="167"></A>or tunic; not that he sought vain-glory from such novelties, but he would 
<A NAME="168"></A>accustom himself to be ashamed only of what deserves shame, and to despise 
<A NAME="169"></A>all other sorts of disgrace.
<A NAME="170"></A><BR><BR>The estate of one Cato, his cousin, which was worth one hundred 
<A NAME="171"></A>talents, falling to him, he turned it all into ready money, which he kept 
<A NAME="172"></A>by him for any of friends that should happen to want, to whom he would 
<A NAME="173"></A>lend it without interest. And for some of them, he suffered his own land 
<A NAME="174"></A>and his slaves to be mortgaged to the public treasury.
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR>When he thought himself of an age fit to marry, having never before 
<A NAME="176"></A>known any woman, he was contracted to Lepida, who had before been contracted 
<A NAME="177"></A>to Metellus Scipio, but on Scipio's own withdrawal from it, the contract 
<A NAME="178"></A>had been dissolved, and she left at liberty. Yet Scipio afterwards repenting 
<A NAME="179"></A>himself, did all he could to regain her, before the marriage with Cato 
<A NAME="180"></A>was completed, and succeeded in so doing. At which Cato was violently incensed, 
<A NAME="181"></A>and resolved at first to go to law about it; but his friends persuaded 
<A NAME="182"></A>him to the contrary. However, he was so moved by the beat of youth and 
<A NAME="183"></A>passion that he wrote a quantity of iambic verses against Scipio, in the 
<A NAME="184"></A>bitter, sarcastic style of Archilochus, without, however, his licence and 
<A NAME="185"></A>scurrility. After this, he married Atilia, the daughter of Soranus, the 
<A NAME="186"></A>first but not the only woman he ever knew, less happy thus far than Laelius, 
<A NAME="187"></A>the friend of Scipio, who in the whole course of so long a life never knew 
<A NAME="188"></A>but the one woman, to whom he was united in his first and only 
<A NAME="189"></A>marriage.
<A NAME="190"></A><BR><BR>In the war of the slaves, which took its name from Spartacus, their 
<A NAME="191"></A>ringleader, Gellius was general, and Cato went a volunteer, for the sake 
<A NAME="192"></A>of his brother Caepio, who was a tribune in the army. Cato could find here 
<A NAME="193"></A>no opportunity to show his zeal or exercise his valour, on account of the 
<A NAME="194"></A>ill conduct of the general. However, amidst the corruption and disorders 
<A NAME="195"></A>of that army, he showed such a love of discipline, so much bravery upon 
<A NAME="196"></A>occasion, and so much courage and wisdom in everything, that it appeared 
<A NAME="197"></A>he was in no way inferior to the old Cato. Gellius offered him great rewards, 
<A NAME="198"></A>and would have decreed him the first honours; which, however, he refused, 
<A NAME="199"></A>saying he had done nothing that deserved them. This made him be thought 
<A NAME="200"></A>a man of strange and eccentric temper.
<A NAME="201"></A><BR><BR>There was a law passed, moreover, that the candidates who stood 
<A NAME="202"></A>for any office should not have prompters in their canvass, to tell them 
<A NAME="203"></A>the names of the citizens; and Cato, when he sued to be elected tribune, 
<A NAME="204"></A>was the only man that obeyed this law. He took great pains to learn by 
<A NAME="205"></A>his own knowledge to salute those he had to speak with, and to call them 
<A NAME="206"></A>by their names; yet even those who praised him for this, did not do so 
<A NAME="207"></A>without some envy and jealousy, for the more they considered the excellence 
<A NAME="208"></A>of what he did, the more they were grieved at the difficulty they found 
<A NAME="209"></A>to do the like.
<A NAME="210"></A><BR><BR>Being chosen tribune, he was sent into Macedon to join Rubrius, 
<A NAME="211"></A>who was general there. It is said that his wife showing much concern, and 
<A NAME="212"></A>weeping at his departure, Munatius, one of Cato's friends, said to her, 
<A NAME="213"></A>"Do not trouble yourself, Atilia, I will engage to watch over him for you." 
<A NAME="214"></A>"By all means," replied Cato; and when they had gone one day's journey 
<A NAME="215"></A>together, "Now," said he to Munatius, after they had supped, "that you 
<A NAME="216"></A>may be sure to keep your promise to Atilia, you must not leave me day nor 
<A NAME="217"></A>night," and from that time, he ordered two beds to be made in his own chamber, 
<A NAME="218"></A>that Munatius might lie there. And so he continued to do, Cato making it 
<A NAME="219"></A>his jest to see that he was always there. There went with him fifteen slaves, 
<A NAME="220"></A>two freedmen, and four of his friends; these rode on horseback, but Cato 
<A NAME="221"></A>always went on foot, yet would he keep by them, and talk with each of them 
<A NAME="222"></A>in turn as they went.
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR>When he came to the army, which consisted of several legions, the 
<A NAME="224"></A>general gave him the command of one; and as he looked upon it as a small 
<A NAME="225"></A>matter, and not worthy a commander, to give evidence of his own signal 
<A NAME="226"></A>valour, he resolved to make his soldiers, as far as he could, like himself, 
<A NAME="227"></A>not, however, in this relaxing the terrors of his office, but associating 
<A NAME="228"></A>reason with his authority. He persuaded and instructed every one in particular, 
<A NAME="229"></A>and bestowed rewards or punishments according to desert; and at length 
<A NAME="230"></A>his men were so well disciplined, that it was hard to say whether they 
<A NAME="231"></A>were more peaceable or more warlike, more valiant or more just; they were 
<A NAME="232"></A>alike formidable to their enemies their enemies and courteous to their 
<A NAME="233"></A>allies, fearful to do wrong, and forward to gain honour. And Cato himself 
<A NAME="234"></A>acquired in the fullest measure, what it had been his least desire to seek, 
<A NAME="235"></A>glory and good repute; he was highly esteemed by all men, and entirely 
<A NAME="236"></A>beloved by the soldiers. Whatever he commanded to be done, he himself took 
<A NAME="237"></A>part in the performing; in his apparel, his diet, and mode of travelling, 
<A NAME="238"></A>he was more like a common soldier than an officer; but in character, high 
<A NAME="239"></A>purpose, and wisdom, he far exceeded all that had the names and titles 
<A NAME="240"></A>of commanders, and he made himself, without knowing it, the object of general 
<A NAME="241"></A>affection. For the true love of virtue is in all men produced by the love 
<A NAME="242"></A>and respect they bear to him that teaches it; and those who praise good 
<A NAME="243"></A>men, yet do not love them, may respect their reputation, but do not really 
<A NAME="244"></A>admire, and will never imitate their virtue.
<A NAME="245"></A><BR><BR>There dwelt at that time in Pergamus, Athenodorus, surnamed Cordylio, 
<A NAME="246"></A>a man of high repute for his knowledge of the Stoic philosophy, who was 
<A NAME="247"></A>now grown old, and had always steadily refused the friendship and acquaintance 
<A NAME="248"></A>of princes and great men. Cato understood this; so that imagining he should 
<A NAME="249"></A>not be able to prevail with him by sending or writing, and being by the 
<A NAME="250"></A>laws allowed two months' absence from the army, he resolved to go into 
<A NAME="251"></A>Asia to see him in person, trusting to his own good qualities not to lose 
<A NAME="252"></A>his labour. And when he had conversed with him, and succeeded in persuading 
<A NAME="253"></A>him out of his former resolutions, he returned and brought him to the camp 
<A NAME="254"></A>as joyful and as proud of this victory as if he had done some heroic exploit, 
<A NAME="255"></A>greater than any of those of Pompey or Lucullus, who with their armies 
<A NAME="256"></A>at that time were subduing so many nations and kingdoms.
<A NAME="257"></A><BR><BR>While Cato was yet in the service, his brother, on a journey towards 
<A NAME="258"></A>Asia, fell sick at Aenus in Thrace, letters with intelligence of which 
<A NAME="259"></A>were immediately despatched to him. The sea was very rough, and no convenient 
<A NAME="260"></A>ship of any size to be had; so Cato getting into a small trading-vessel, 
<A NAME="261"></A>with only two of his friends, and three servants, set sail from Thessalonica, 
<A NAME="262"></A>and having very narrowly escaped drowning, he arrived at Aenus just as 
<A NAME="263"></A>Caepio expired. Upon this occasion, he was thought to have showed himself 
<A NAME="264"></A>more a fond brother than a philosopher, not only in the excess of his grief, 
<A NAME="265"></A>bewailing and embracing the dead body, but also in the extravagant expenses 
<A NAME="266"></A>of the funeral, the vast quantity of rich perfumes and costly garments 
<A NAME="267"></A>which were burnt with the corpse, and the monument of Thasian marble, which 
<A NAME="268"></A>he erected, at the cost of eight talents, in the public place of the town 
<A NAME="269"></A>of Aenus. For there were some who took upon them to cavil at all this, 
<A NAME="270"></A>as not consistent with his usual calmness and moderation, not discerning 
<A NAME="271"></A>that though he were steadfast, firm, and inflexible to pleasure, fear or 
<A NAME="272"></A>foolish entreaties, yet he was full of natural tenderness and brotherly 
<A NAME="273"></A>affection. Divers of the cities and princes of the country sent him many 
<A NAME="274"></A>presents, to honour the funeral of his brother; but he took none of their 
<A NAME="275"></A>money, only the perfumes and ornaments he received, and paid for them also. 
<A NAME="276"></A>And afterwards, when the inheritance was divided between him and Caepio's 
<A NAME="277"></A>daughter, he did not require any portion of the funeral expenses to be 
<A NAME="278"></A>discharged out of it. Notwithstanding this, it has been affirmed that he 
<A NAME="279"></A>made his brother's ashes be passed through a sieve, to find the gold that 
<A NAME="280"></A>was melted down when burnt with the body. But he who made this statement 
<A NAME="281"></A>appears to have anticipated an exemption for his pen, as much as for his 
<A NAME="282"></A>sword, from all question and criticism.
<A NAME="283"></A><BR><BR>The time of Cato's service in the army being expired, he received, 
<A NAME="284"></A>at his departure, not only the prayers and praises, but the tears and embraces 
<A NAME="285"></A>of the soldiers, who spread their clothes at his feet and kissed his hand 
<A NAME="286"></A>as he passed, an honour which the Romans at that time scarcely paid even 
<A NAME="287"></A>to a very few of their generals and commanders-in-chief. Having left the 
<A NAME="288"></A>army, he resolved, before he would return home and apply himself to state 
<A NAME="289"></A>affairs, to travel in Asia, and observe the manners, the customs, and the 
<A NAME="290"></A>strength of every province. He was also unwilling to refuse the kindness 
<A NAME="291"></A>of Deiotarus, King of Galatia, who having had great familiarity and friendship 
<A NAME="292"></A>with his father, was very desirous to receive a visit from him. Cato's 
<A NAME="293"></A>arrangements in his journey were as follows. Early in the morning he sent 
<A NAME="294"></A>out his baker and his cook towards the place where he designed to stay 
<A NAME="295"></A>the next night; these went soberly and quietly into the town, in which, 
<A NAME="296"></A>if there happened to be no friend or acquaintance of Cato or his family, 
<A NAME="297"></A>they provided for him in an inn, and gave no disturbance to anybody; but 
<A NAME="298"></A>if there were no inn, then and in this case only, they went to the magistrates, 
<A NAME="299"></A>and desiring them to help them to lodgings, took without complaint whatever 
<A NAME="300"></A>was allotted to them. His servants thus behaving themselves towards the 
<A NAME="301"></A>magistrates, without noise and threatening, were often discredited, or 
<A NAME="302"></A>neglected by them, so that Cato many times arrived and found nothing provided 
<A NAME="303"></A>for him. And it was all the worse when he appeared himself; still less 
<A NAME="304"></A>account was taken of him. When they saw him sitting, without saying anything, 
<A NAME="305"></A>on his baggage, they set him down at once as a person of no consequence, 
<A NAME="306"></A>who did not venture to make any demand. Sometimes, on such occasions, he 
<A NAME="307"></A>would call them to him and tell them, "Foolish people, lay aside this inhospitality. 
<A NAME="308"></A>All your visitors will not be Catos. Use your courtesy, to take off the 
<A NAME="309"></A>sharp edge of power. There are men enough who desire but a pretence, to 
<A NAME="310"></A>take from you by force, what you give with such reluctance."
<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR>While he travelled in this manner, a diverting accident befell 
<A NAME="312"></A>him in Syria. As he was going into Antioch, he saw a great multitude of 
<A NAME="313"></A>people outside the gates, ranged in order on either side the way; here 
<A NAME="314"></A>the young men with long cloaks, there the children decently dressed; others 
<A NAME="315"></A>wore garlands and white garments who were the priests and magistrates. 
<A NAME="316"></A>Cato imagining all this could mean nothing but a display in honour of his 
<A NAME="317"></A>reception, began to be angry with his servants, who had been sent before, 
<A NAME="318"></A>for suffering it to be done; then making his friends alight, he walked 
<A NAME="319"></A>along with them on foot. As soon as he came near the gate, an elderly man, 
<A NAME="320"></A>who seemed to be master of these ceremonies, with a wand and a garland 
<A NAME="321"></A>in his hand, came up to Cato, and without saluting him, asked him where 
<A NAME="322"></A>he had left Demetrius, and how soon he thought he would he there. This 
<A NAME="323"></A>Demetrius was Pompey's servant, and as at this time the whole world, so 
<A NAME="324"></A>to say, had its eyes fixed upon Pompey, this man also was highly honoured, 
<A NAME="325"></A>on account of his influence with his master. Upon this Cato's friends fell 
<A NAME="326"></A>into such violent laughter, that they could not restrain themselves while 
<A NAME="327"></A>they passed through the crowd; and he himself, ashamed and distressed, 
<A NAME="328"></A>uttered the words, "Unfortunate city!" and said no more. Afterwards however, 
<A NAME="329"></A>it always made him laugh, when he either told the story or was otherwise 
<A NAME="330"></A>reminded of it.
<A NAME="331"></A><BR><BR>Pompey himself shortly after made the people ashamed of their ignorance 
<A NAME="332"></A>and folly in thus neglecting him, for Cato, coming in his journey to Ephesus, 
<A NAME="333"></A>went to pay his respects to him, who was the elder man, had gained much 
<A NAME="334"></A>honour, and was then general of a great army. Yet Pompey would not receive 
<A NAME="335"></A>him sitting, but as soon as he saw him, rose up, and going to meet him, 
<A NAME="336"></A>as the more honourable person, gave him his hand, and embraced him with 
<A NAME="337"></A>great show of kindness. He said much in commendation of his virtue both 
<A NAME="338"></A>at that time when receiving him, and also yet more after he had withdrawn. 
<A NAME="339"></A>So that now all men began at once to display their respect for Cato, and 
<A NAME="340"></A>discovered in him the very same things for which they despised him before, 
<A NAME="341"></A>an admirable mildness of temper and greatness of spirit. And indeed the 
<A NAME="342"></A>civility that Pompey himself showed him appeared to come from one that 
<A NAME="343"></A>rather respected than loved him; and the general opinion was, that while 
<A NAME="344"></A>Cato was there he paid him admiration, but was not sorry when he was gone. 
<A NAME="345"></A>For when other young men came to see him he usually urged and entreated 
<A NAME="346"></A>them to continue with him. Now he did not at all invite Cato to stay, but 
<A NAME="347"></A>as if his own power were lessened by the other's presence, he very willingly 
<A NAME="348"></A>allowed him to take his leave. Yet to Cato alone, of all those who went 
<A NAME="349"></A>for Rome, he recommended his children and his wife, who was indeed connected 
<A NAME="350"></A>by relationship with Cato.
<A NAME="351"></A><BR><BR>After this, all the cities through which he passed strove and emulated 
<A NAME="352"></A>each other in showing him respect and honour. Feasts and entertainments 
<A NAME="353"></A>were made for his reception, so that he bade his friends keep strict watch 
<A NAME="354"></A>and take care of him, lest he should end by making good what was said by 
<A NAME="355"></A>Curio, who though he were his familiar friend, yet disliking the austerity 
<A NAME="356"></A>of his temper, asked him one day if, when he left the army, he designed 
<A NAME="357"></A>to see Asia, and Cato answering, "Yes, by all means." "You do well," replied 
<A NAME="358"></A>Curio, "you will bring back with you a better temper and pleasanter manners;" 
<A NAME="359"></A>pretty nearly the very words he used.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR>Deiotarus, being now an old man, had sent for Cato, to recommend 
<A NAME="361"></A>his children and family to his protection; and as soon as he came, brought 
<A NAME="362"></A>him presents of all sorts of things, which he begged and entreated him 
<A NAME="363"></A>to accept. And his importunities displeased Cato so much, that though he 
<A NAME="364"></A>came but in the evening, he stayed only that night, and went away early 
<A NAME="365"></A>the next morning. After he was gone one day's journey, he found at Pessinus 
<A NAME="366"></A>a yet greater quantity of presents provided for him there, and also letters 
<A NAME="367"></A>from Deiotarus entreating him to receive them, or at least to permit his 
<A NAME="368"></A>friends to take them, who for his sake deserved some gratification, and 
<A NAME="369"></A>could not have much done for them out of Cato's own means. Yet he would 
<A NAME="370"></A>not suffer it, though he saw some of them very willing to receive such 
<A NAME="371"></A>gifts, and ready to complain of his severity; but he answered, that corruption 
<A NAME="372"></A>would never want pretence, and his friends should share with him in whatever 
<A NAME="373"></A>he should justly and honestly obtain, and so returned the presents to 
<A NAME="374"></A>Deiotarus.
<A NAME="375"></A><BR><BR>When he took ship for Brundusium, his friends would have persuaded 
<A NAME="376"></A>him to put his brother's ashes into another vessel; but he said he would 
<A NAME="377"></A>sooner part with his life than leave them, and so set sail. And as it chanced, 
<A NAME="378"></A>he, we are told, had a very dangerous passage, though others at the same 
<A NAME="379"></A>time went over safely enough.
<A NAME="380"></A><BR><BR>After he was returned to Rome, he spent his time for the most part 
<A NAME="381"></A>either at home, in conversation with Athenodorus, or at the forum, in the 
<A NAME="382"></A>service of his friends. Though it was now the time that he should become 
<A NAME="383"></A>quaestor, he would not stand for the place till he had studied the laws 
<A NAME="384"></A>relating to it, and by inquiry from persons of experience, had attained 
<A NAME="385"></A>a distinct understanding of the duty and authority belonging to it. With 
<A NAME="386"></A>this knowledge, as soon as he came into the office, he made a great reformation 
<A NAME="387"></A>among the clerks and under-officers of the treasury, people who had long 
<A NAME="388"></A>practice and familiarity in all the public records and the laws, and, when 
<A NAME="389"></A>new magistrates came in year by year so ignorant and unskillful as to be 
<A NAME="390"></A>in absolute need of others to teach them what to do, did not submit and 
<A NAME="391"></A>give way, but kept the power in their own hands, and were in effect the 
<A NAME="392"></A>treasurers themselves. Till Cato, applying himself roundly to the work, 
<A NAME="393"></A>showed that he possessed not only the title and honour of a quaestor, but 
<A NAME="394"></A>the knowledge and understanding and full authority of his office. So that 
<A NAME="395"></A>he used the clerks and under-officers like servants as they were, exposing 
<A NAME="396"></A>their corrupt practices, and instructing their ignorance. Being bold, impudent 
<A NAME="397"></A>fellows, they flattered the other quaestors his colleagues, and by their 
<A NAME="398"></A>means endeavoured to maintain an opposition against him. But he convicted 
<A NAME="399"></A>the chiefest of them of a breach of trust in the charge of an inheritance, 
<A NAME="400"></A>and turned him out of his place. A second he brought to trial for dishonesty, 
<A NAME="401"></A>who was defended by Lutatius Catulus, at that time censor, a man very considerable 
<A NAME="402"></A>for his office, but yet more for his character, as he was eminent above 
<A NAME="403"></A>all the Romans of that age for his reputed wisdom integrity. He was also 
<A NAME="404"></A>intimate with Cato, and much commended his way of living. So perceiving 
<A NAME="405"></A>he could not bring off his client, if he stood a fair trial, he openly 
<A NAME="406"></A>began to beg him off. Cato objected to his doing this. And when he continued 
<A NAME="407"></A>still to be importunate, "It would be shameful, Catulus," he said, "that 
<A NAME="408"></A>the censor, the judge of all our lives, should incur the dishonour of removal 
<A NAME="409"></A>by our officers." At this expression, Catulus looked as if he would have 
<A NAME="410"></A>made some answer; but he said nothing and either through anger or shame 
<A NAME="411"></A>went away silent, and out of countenance. Nevertheless, the man was not 
<A NAME="412"></A>found guilty, for the voices that acquitted him were but one in number 
<A NAME="413"></A>less than those that condemned him, and Marcus Lollius, one of Cato's colleagues, 
<A NAME="414"></A>who was absent by reason of sickness, was sent for by Catulus, and entreated 
<A NAME="415"></A>to come and save the man. So Lollius was brought into court in a chair, 
<A NAME="416"></A>and gave his voice also for acquitting him. Yet Cato never after made use 
<A NAME="417"></A>of that clerk, and never paid him his salary, nor would he make any account 
<A NAME="418"></A>of the vote given by Lollius. Having thus humbled the clerks, and brought 
<A NAME="419"></A>them to be at command, he made use of the books and registers as he thought 
<A NAME="420"></A>fit, and in a little while gained the treasury a higher name than the senate-house 
<A NAME="421"></A>itself; and all men said, Cato had made the office of a quaestor equal 
<A NAME="422"></A>to the dignity of a consul. When he found many indebted to the state upon 
<A NAME="423"></A>old accounts, and the state also in debt to many private persons, he took 
<A NAME="424"></A>care that the public might no longer either do or suffer wrong; he strictly 
<A NAME="425"></A>and punctually exacted what was due to the treasury, and as freely and 
<A NAME="426"></A>speedily paid all those to whom it was indebted. So that the people were 
<A NAME="427"></A>filled with sentiments of awe and respect, on seeing those made to pay, 
<A NAME="428"></A>who thought to have escaped with their plunder, and others receiving all 
<A NAME="429"></A>their due, who despaired of getting anything. And whereas usually those 
<A NAME="430"></A>who brought false bills and pretended orders of the senate, could through 
<A NAME="431"></A>favour get them accepted, Cato would never be so imposed upon; and in the 
<A NAME="432"></A>case of one particular order, on the question arising whether it had passed 
<A NAME="433"></A>the senate, he would not believe a great many witnesses that attested it, 
<A NAME="434"></A>nor would admit of it, till the consuls came and affirmed it upon 
<A NAME="435"></A>oath.
<A NAME="436"></A><BR><BR>There were at that time a great many whom Sylla had made use of 
<A NAME="437"></A>as his agents in the proscription, and to whom he had for their service 
<A NAME="438"></A>in putting men to death, given twelve thousand drachmas apiece. These men 
<A NAME="439"></A>everybody hated as wicked and polluted wretches, but nobody durst be revenged 
<A NAME="440"></A>upon them. Cato called every one to account, as wrongfully possessed of 
<A NAME="441"></A>the public money, and exacted it of them, and at the same time sharply 
<A NAME="442"></A>reproved them for their unlawful and impious actions. After these proceedings 
<A NAME="443"></A>they were presently accused of murder, and being already in a manner prejudged 
<A NAME="444"></A>as guilty, they were easily found so, and accordingly suffered; at which 
<A NAME="445"></A>the whole people rejoiced and thought themselves now to see the old tyranny 
<A NAME="446"></A>finally abolished, and Sylla himself, so to say, brought to 
<A NAME="447"></A>punishment.
<A NAME="448"></A><BR><BR>Cato's assiduity also, and indefatigable diligence, won very much 
<A NAME="449"></A>upon the people. He always came first of any of his colleagues to the treasury, 
<A NAME="450"></A>and away the last. He never missed any assembly of the people, or sitting 
<A NAME="451"></A>of the senate; being always anxious and on the watch for those who lightly, 
<A NAME="452"></A>or as a matter of interest, passed votes in favour of this or that person, 
<A NAME="453"></A>for remitting debts or granting away customs that were owing to the state. 
<A NAME="454"></A>And at length, having kept the exchequer pure and clear from base informers, 
<A NAME="455"></A>and yet having filled it with treasure, he made it appear that the state 
<A NAME="456"></A>might be rich without oppressing the people. At first he excited feelings 
<A NAME="457"></A>of dislike and irritation in some of his colleagues, but after a while 
<A NAME="458"></A>they were well contented with him, since he was perfectly willing that 
<A NAME="459"></A>they should cast all the odium on him, when they declined to gratify their 
<A NAME="460"></A>friends with the public money, or to give dishonest judgments in passing 
<A NAME="461"></A>their accounts; and when hard-pressed by suitors, they could readily answer 
<A NAME="462"></A>it was impossible to do anything unless Cato would consent. On the last 
<A NAME="463"></A>day of his office, he was honourably attended to his house by, almost all 
<A NAME="464"></A>the people; but on the way he was informed that several powerful friends 
<A NAME="465"></A>were in the treasury with Marcellus, using all their interest with him 
<A NAME="466"></A>to pass a certain debt to the public revenue, as if it had been a gift. 
<A NAME="467"></A>Marcellus had been one of Cato's friends from his childhood, and so long 
<A NAME="468"></A>as Cato was with him, was one of the best of his colleagues in this office, 
<A NAME="469"></A>but when alone, was unable to resist the importunity of suitors, and prone 
<A NAME="470"></A>to do anybody a kindness. So Cato immediately turned back, and finding 
<A NAME="471"></A>that Marcellus had yielded to pass the thing, he took the book, and while 
<A NAME="472"></A>Marcellus silently stood by and looked on, struck it out. This done, he 
<A NAME="473"></A>brought Marcellus out of the treasury, and took him home with him; who 
<A NAME="474"></A>for all this, neither then, nor ever after, complained of him, but always 
<A NAME="475"></A>continued his friendship and familiarity with him.
<A NAME="476"></A><BR><BR>Cato, after he had laid down his office, yet did not cease to keep 
<A NAME="477"></A>a watch upon the treasury. He had his servants who continually wrote out 
<A NAME="478"></A>the details of the expenditure, and he himself kept always by him certain 
<A NAME="479"></A>books, which contained the accounts of the revenue from Sylla's time to 
<A NAME="480"></A>his own quaestorship, which he had bought for five talents.
<A NAME="481"></A><BR><BR>He was always first at the senate, and went out last; and often, 
<A NAME="482"></A>while the others were slowly collecting, he would sit and read by himself, 
<A NAME="483"></A>holding his gown before his book. He was never once out of town when the 
<A NAME="484"></A>senate was to meet. And when afterwards Pompey and his party, finding that 
<A NAME="485"></A>he could never be either persuaded or compelled to favour their unjust 
<A NAME="486"></A>designs, endeavoured to keep him from the senate, by engaging him in business 
<A NAME="487"></A>for his friends, to plead their causes, or arbitrate in their differences, 
<A NAME="488"></A>or the like, he quickly discovered the trick, and to defeat it, fairly 
<A NAME="489"></A>told all his acquaintance that he would never meddle in any private business 
<A NAME="490"></A>when the senate was assembled. Since it was not in the hope of gaining 
<A NAME="491"></A>honour or riches, nor out of mere impulse, or by chance that he engaged 
<A NAME="492"></A>himself in politics, but he undertook the service of the state as the proper 
<A NAME="493"></A>business of honest man, and therefore he thought himself obliged to be 
<A NAME="494"></A>as constant to his public duty as the bee to the honeycomb. To this end, 
<A NAME="495"></A>he took care to have his friends and correspondents everywhere, to send 
<A NAME="496"></A>him reports of the edicts, decrees, judgments, and all the important proceedings 
<A NAME="497"></A>that passed in any of the provinces. Once when Clodius, the seditious orator, 
<A NAME="498"></A>to promote his violent and revolutionary projects, traduced to the people 
<A NAME="499"></A>some of the priests and priestesses (among whom Fabia, sister to Cicero's 
<A NAME="500"></A>wife, Terentia, ran great danger), Cato having boldly interfered, and having 
<A NAME="501"></A>made Clodius appear so infamous that he was forced to leave the town, was 
<A NAME="502"></A>addressed, when it was over, by Cicero, who came to thank him for what 
<A NAME="503"></A>he had done. "You must thank the commonwealth," said he, for whose sake 
<A NAME="504"></A>alone he professed to do everything. Thus he gained a great and wonderful 
<A NAME="505"></A>reputation; so that an advocate in a cause, where there was only one witness 
<A NAME="506"></A>against him, told the judges they ought not to rely upon a single witness, 
<A NAME="507"></A>though it were Cato himself. And it was a sort of proverb with many people, 
<A NAME="508"></A>if any very unlikely and incredible thing were asserted, to say, they would 
<A NAME="509"></A>not believe it, though Cato himself should affirm it. One day a debauched 
<A NAME="510"></A>and sumptuous liver talking in the senate about frugality and temperance, 
<A NAME="511"></A>Anaeus standing up, cried, "Who can endure this, sir, to have you feast 
<A NAME="512"></A>like Crassus, build like Lucullus, and talk like Cato." So likewise those 
<A NAME="513"></A>who were vicious and dissolute in their manners, yet affected to be grave 
<A NAME="514"></A>and severe in their language, were in derision called 
<A NAME="515"></A>Catos.
<A NAME="516"></A><BR><BR>At first, when his friends would have persuaded him to stand to 
<A NAME="517"></A>be tribune of the people, he thought it undesirable; for that the power 
<A NAME="518"></A>of so great an office ought to be reserved, as the strongest medicines, 
<A NAME="519"></A>for occasions of the last necessity. But afterwards in a vacation time, 
<A NAME="520"></A>as he was going, accompanied with his books and philosophers, to Lucania, 
<A NAME="521"></A>where he had lands with a pleasant residence, they met by the way a great 
<A NAME="522"></A>many horses, carriages, and attendants, of whom they understood, that Metellus 
<A NAME="523"></A>Nepos was going to Rome, to stand to be tribune of the people. Hereupon 
<A NAME="524"></A>Cato stopped, and after a little pause, gave orders to return back immediately; 
<A NAME="525"></A>at which the company seeming to wonder, "Don't you know," said he, "how 
<A NAME="526"></A>dangerous of itself the madness of Metellus is? and now that he comes armed 
<A NAME="527"></A>with the support of Pompey, he will fall like lightning on the state, and 
<A NAME="528"></A>bring it to utter disorder; therefore this is no time for idleness and 
<A NAME="529"></A>diversion, but we must go and prevent this man in his designs, or bravely 
<A NAME="530"></A>die in defence of our liberty." Nevertheless, by the persuasion of his 
<A NAME="531"></A>friends, he went first to his country-house, where he stayed but a very 
<A NAME="532"></A>little time, and then returned to town.
<A NAME="533"></A><BR><BR>He arrived in the evening, and went straight the next morning to 
<A NAME="534"></A>the forum, where he began to solicit for the tribuneship, in opposition 
<A NAME="535"></A>to Metellus. The power of this office consists rather in controlling than 
<A NAME="536"></A>performing any business; for though all the rest except any one tribune 
<A NAME="537"></A>should be agreed, yet his denial or intercession could put a stop to the 
<A NAME="538"></A>whole matter. Cato, at first, had not many that appeared for him; but as 
<A NAME="539"></A>soon as his design was known, all the good and distinguished persons of 
<A NAME="540"></A>the city quickly came forward to encourage and support him, looking upon 
<A NAME="541"></A>him, not as one that desired a favour of them, but one that proposed to 
<A NAME="542"></A>do a great favour to his country and all honest men; who had many times 
<A NAME="543"></A>refused the same office, when he might have had it without trouble, but 
<A NAME="544"></A>now sought it with danger, that he might defend their liberty and their 
<A NAME="545"></A>government. It is reported that so great a number flocked about him that 
<A NAME="546"></A>he was like to be stifled amidst the press, and could scarce get through 
<A NAME="547"></A>the crowd. He was declared tribune, with several others, among whom was 
<A NAME="548"></A>Metellus.
<A NAME="549"></A><BR><BR>When Cato was chosen into this office, observing that the election 
<A NAME="550"></A>of consuls was become a matter of purchase, he sharply rebuked the people 
<A NAME="551"></A>for this corruption, and in the conclusion of his speech protested he would 
<A NAME="552"></A>bring to trial whomever he should find giving money, making an exception 
<A NAME="553"></A>only in the case of Silanus, on account of their near connection, he having 
<A NAME="554"></A>married Servilia, Cato's sister. He therefore did not prosecute him, but 
<A NAME="555"></A>accused Lucius Murena, who had been chosen consul by corrupt means with 
<A NAME="556"></A>Silanus. There was a law that the party accused might appoint a person 
<A NAME="557"></A>to keep watch upon his accuser, that he might know fairly what means he 
<A NAME="558"></A>took in preparing the accusation. He that was set upon Cato by Murena, 
<A NAME="559"></A>at first followed and observed him strictly, yet never found him dealing 
<A NAME="560"></A>any way unfairly or insidiously, but always generously and candidly going 
<A NAME="561"></A>on in the just and open methods of proceeding. And he so admired Cato's 
<A NAME="562"></A>great spirit, and so entirely trusted to his integrity, that meeting him 
<A NAME="563"></A>in the forum, or going to his house, he would ask him if he designed to 
<A NAME="564"></A>do anything that day in order to the accusation, and if Cato said no, he 
<A NAME="565"></A>went away, relying on his word. When the cause was pleaded Cicero, who 
<A NAME="566"></A>was then consul and defended Murena, took occasion to be extremely witty 
<A NAME="567"></A>and jocose, in reference to Cato, upon the Stoic philosophers, and their 
<A NAME="568"></A>paradoxes, as they call them, and so excited great laughter among the judges; 
<A NAME="569"></A>upon which Cato, smiling, said to the standers-by, "What a pleasant consul 
<A NAME="570"></A>we have, my friends." Murena was acquitted, and afterwards showed himself 
<A NAME="571"></A>a man of no ill-feeling or want of sense; for when he was consul, he always 
<A NAME="572"></A>took Cato's advice in the most weighty affairs and, during all the time 
<A NAME="573"></A>of his office, paid him much honour and respect. Of which not only Murena's 
<A NAME="574"></A>prudence, but also Cato's own behaviour, was the cause; for though he were 
<A NAME="575"></A>terrible and severe as to matters of justice, in the senate, and at the 
<A NAME="576"></A>bar, yet after the thing was over his manner to all men was perfectly friendly 
<A NAME="577"></A>and humane.
<A NAME="578"></A><BR><BR>Before he entered on the office of tribune, he assisted Cicero, 
<A NAME="579"></A>at that time consul, in many contests that concerned his office, but most 
<A NAME="580"></A>especially in his great and noble acts at the time of Catiline's conspiracy; 
<A NAME="581"></A>which owed their last successful issue to Cato. Catiline had plotted a 
<A NAME="582"></A>dreadful and entire subversion of the Roman state by sedition and open 
<A NAME="583"></A>war, but being convicted by Cicero, was forced to fly the city. Yet Lentulus 
<A NAME="584"></A>and Cethegus remained, with several others, to carry on the same plot; 
<A NAME="585"></A>and blaming Catiline, as one that wanted courage, and had been timid and 
<A NAME="586"></A>petty in his designs, they themselves resolved to set the whole town on 
<A NAME="587"></A>fire, and utterly to overthrow the empire, rousing whole nations to revolt 
<A NAME="588"></A>and exciting foreign wars. But the design was discovered by Cicero (as 
<A NAME="589"></A>we have written in his life), and the matter brought before the senate. 
<A NAME="590"></A>Silanus, who spoke first, delivered his opinion, that the conspirators 
<A NAME="591"></A>ought to suffer the last of punishments, and was therein followed by all 
<A NAME="592"></A>who spoke after him; till it came to Caesar, who being an excellent speaker, 
<A NAME="593"></A>and looking upon all changes and commotions in the state as materials useful 
<A NAME="594"></A>for his own purposes, desired rather to increase than extinguish them; 
<A NAME="595"></A>and standing up, he made a very merciful and persuasive speech, that they 
<A NAME="596"></A>ought not to suffer death without fair trial according to law, and moved 
<A NAME="597"></A>that they might be kept in prison. Thus was the house almost wholly turned 
<A NAME="598"></A>by Caesar, apprehending also the anger of the people; insomuch that even 
<A NAME="599"></A>Silanus retracted, and said he did not mean to propose death, but imprisonment, 
<A NAME="600"></A>for that was the utmost a Roman could suffer.
<A NAME="601"></A><BR><BR>Upon this they were all inclined to the milder and more merciful 
<A NAME="602"></A>opinion, when Cato, standing up, began at once with great passion and vehemence 
<A NAME="603"></A>to reproach Silanus for his change of opinion, and to attack Caesar, who 
<A NAME="604"></A>would, he said, ruin the commonwealth by soft words and popular speeches, 
<A NAME="605"></A>and was endeavouring to frighten the senate, when he himself ought to fear, 
<A NAME="606"></A>and be thankful, if he escaped unpunished or unsuspected, who thus openly 
<A NAME="607"></A>and boldly dared to protect the enemies of the state, and while finding 
<A NAME="608"></A>no compassion for his own native country, brought, with all its glories, 
<A NAME="609"></A>so near to utter ruin, could yet be full of pity for those men who had 
<A NAME="610"></A>better never have been born, and whose death must deliver the commonwealth 
<A NAME="611"></A>from bloodshed and destruction. This only of all Cato's speeches, it is 
<A NAME="612"></A>said, was preserved; for Cicero, the consul, had disposed in various parts 
<A NAME="613"></A>of the senate-house, several of the most expert and rapid writers, whom 
<A NAME="614"></A>he had taught to make figures comprising numerous words in a few short 
<A NAME="615"></A>strokes; as up to that time they had not used those we call shorthand writers, 
<A NAME="616"></A>who then, as it is said, established the first example of the art. Thus 
<A NAME="617"></A>Cato carried it, and so turned the house again, that it was decreed the 
<A NAME="618"></A>conspirators should be put to death.
<A NAME="619"></A><BR><BR>Not to omit any small matters that may serve to show Cato's temper, 
<A NAME="620"></A>and add something to the portraiture of his mind, it is reported, that 
<A NAME="621"></A>while Caesar and he were in the very heat, and the whole senate regarding 
<A NAME="622"></A>them two, a little note was brought in to Caesar which Cato declared to 
<A NAME="623"></A>be suspicious, and urging that some seditious act was going on, bade the 
<A NAME="624"></A>letter be read. Upon which Caesar handed the paper to Cato; who, discovering 
<A NAME="625"></A>it to be a love-letter from his sister Servilia to Caesar, by whom she 
<A NAME="626"></A>had been corrupted, threw it to him again, saying, "Take it, drunkard," 
<A NAME="627"></A>and so went on with his discourse. And, indeed, it seems Cato had but ill-fortune 
<A NAME="628"></A>in women; for this lady was ill-spoken of for her familiarity with Caesar, 
<A NAME="629"></A>and the other Servilia, Cato's sister also, was yet more ill-conducted; 
<A NAME="630"></A>for being married to Lucullus, one of the greatest men in Rome, and having 
<A NAME="631"></A>brought him a son, she was afterwards divorced for incontinency. But what 
<A NAME="632"></A>was worst of all, Cato's own wife Atilia was not free from the same fault; 
<A NAME="633"></A>and after she had borne him two children, he was forced to put her away 
<A NAME="634"></A>for her misconduct. After that, he married Marcia, the daughter of Philippus, 
<A NAME="635"></A>a woman of good reputation, who yet has occasioned much discourse; and 
<A NAME="636"></A>the life of Cato, like a dramatic piece, has this one scene or passage 
<A NAME="637"></A>full of perplexity and doubtful meaning.
<A NAME="638"></A><BR><BR>It is thus related by Thrasea, who refers to the authority of Munatius, 
<A NAME="639"></A>Cato's friend and constant companion. Among many that loved and admired 
<A NAME="640"></A>Cato, some were more remarkable and conspicuous than others. Of these was 
<A NAME="641"></A>Quintus Hortensius, a man of high repute and approved virtue, who desired 
<A NAME="642"></A>not only to live in friendship and familiarity with Cato, but also to unite 
<A NAME="643"></A>his whole house and family with him by some sort or other of alliance in 
<A NAME="644"></A>marriage. Therefore he set himself to persuade Cato that his daughter Porcia, 
<A NAME="645"></A>who was already married to, Bibulus, and had borne him two children, might 
<A NAME="646"></A>nevertheless be given to him, as a fair plot of land, to bear fruit also 
<A NAME="647"></A>for him. "For," said he, "though this in the opinion of men may seem strange, 
<A NAME="648"></A>yet in nature it is honest, and profitable for the public that a woman 
<A NAME="649"></A>in the prime of her youth should not lie useless, and lose the fruit of 
<A NAME="650"></A>her womb, nor, on the other side, should burden and impoverish one man, 
<A NAME="651"></A>by bringing him too many children. Also by this communication of families 
<A NAME="652"></A>among worthy men, virtue would increase, and be diffused through their 
<A NAME="653"></A>posterity; and the commonwealth would be united and cemented by their alliances." 
<A NAME="654"></A>Yet if Bibulus would not part with his wife altogether, he would restore 
<A NAME="655"></A>her as soon as she had brought him a child, whereby he might be united 
<A NAME="656"></A>to both their families. Cato answered, that he loved Hortensius very well, 
<A NAME="657"></A>and much approved of uniting their houses, but he thought it strange to 
<A NAME="658"></A>speak of marrying his daughter, when she was already given to another. 
<A NAME="659"></A>Then Hortensius, turning the discourse, did not hesitate to speak openly 
<A NAME="660"></A>and ask for Cato's own wife, for she was young and fruitful, and he had 
<A NAME="661"></A>already children enough. Neither can it be thought that Hortensius did 
<A NAME="662"></A>this, as imagining Cato did not care for Marcia; for, it is said, she was 
<A NAME="663"></A>then with child. Cato, perceiving his earnest desire, did not deny his 
<A NAME="664"></A>request, but said that Philippus, the father of Marcia, ought also to be 
<A NAME="665"></A>consulted. Philippus, therefore, being sent for, came; and finding they 
<A NAME="666"></A>were well agreed, gave his daughter Marcia to Hortensius in the presence 
<A NAME="667"></A>of Cato, who himself also assisted at the marriage. This was done at a 
<A NAME="668"></A>later time, but since I was speaking of women, I thought it well to mention 
<A NAME="669"></A>it now.
<A NAME="670"></A><BR><BR>Lentulus and the rest of the conspirators were put to death; but 
<A NAME="671"></A>Caesar, finding so much insinuated and charged against him in the senate, 
<A NAME="672"></A>betook himself to the people, and proceeded to stir up the most corrupt 
<A NAME="673"></A>and dissolute elements of the state to form a party in his support. Cato, 
<A NAME="674"></A>apprehensive of what might ensue, persuaded the senate to win over the 
<A NAME="675"></A>poor and unprovided-for multitude by a distribution of corn, the annual 
<A NAME="676"></A>charge of which amounted to twelve hundred and fifty talents. This act 
<A NAME="677"></A>of humanity and kindness unquestionably dissipated the present danger. 
<A NAME="678"></A>But Metellus, coming into his office of tribune, began to hold tumultuous 
<A NAME="679"></A>assemblies, and had prepared a decree, that Pompey the Great should presently 
<A NAME="680"></A>be called into Italy, with all his forces, to preserve the city from the 
<A NAME="681"></A>danger of Catiline's conspiracy. This was the fair pretence; but the true 
<A NAME="682"></A>design was to deliver all into the hands of Pompey, and to give him an 
<A NAME="683"></A>absolute power. Upon this the senate was assembled, and Cato did not fall 
<A NAME="684"></A>sharply upon Metellus, as he often did, but urged his advice in the most 
<A NAME="685"></A>reasonable and moderate tone. At last he descended even to entreaty, and 
<A NAME="686"></A>extolled the house of Metellus as having always taken part with the nobility. 
<A NAME="687"></A>At this Metellus grew the more insolent, and despising Cato, as if he yielded 
<A NAME="688"></A>and were afraid, let himself proceed to the most audacious menaces, openly 
<A NAME="689"></A>threatening to do whatever he pleased in spite of the senate. Upon this 
<A NAME="690"></A>Cato changed his countenance, his voice, and his language; and after many 
<A NAME="691"></A>sharp expressions, boldly concluded that, while he lived, Pompey should 
<A NAME="692"></A>never come armed into the city. The senate thought them both extravagant, 
<A NAME="693"></A>and not well in their safe senses; for the design of Metellus seemed to 
<A NAME="694"></A>be mere rage and frenzy, out of excess of mischief bringing all things 
<A NAME="695"></A>to ruin and confusion, and Cato's virtue looked like a kind of ecstasy 
<A NAME="696"></A>of contention in the cause of what was good and just.
<A NAME="697"></A><BR><BR>But when the day came for the people to give their voices for the 
<A NAME="698"></A>passing this decree, and Metellus beforehand occupied the forum with armed 
<A NAME="699"></A>men, strangers, gladiators, and slaves, those that in hopes of change followed 
<A NAME="700"></A>Pompey were known to be no small part of the people, and besides, they 
<A NAME="701"></A>had great assistance from Caesar, who was then praetor; and though the 
<A NAME="702"></A>best and chiefest men of the city were no less offended at these proceedings 
<A NAME="703"></A>than Cato, they seemed rather likely to suffer with him than able to assist 
<A NAME="704"></A>him. In the meantime Cato's whole family were in extreme fear and apprehension 
<A NAME="705"></A>for him; some of his friends neither ate nor slept all the night, passing 
<A NAME="706"></A>the whole time in debating and perplexity; his wife and sisters also bewailed 
<A NAME="707"></A>and lamented him. But he himself, void of all fear, and full of assurance, 
<A NAME="708"></A>comforted and encouraged them by his own words and conversation with them. 
<A NAME="709"></A>After supper he went to rest at his usual hour, and was the next day waked 
<A NAME="710"></A>out of a profound sleep by Minucius Thermus, one of his colleagues. So 
<A NAME="711"></A>soon as he was up, they two went together into the forum, accompanied by 
<A NAME="712"></A>very few, but met by a great many, who bade them have a care of themselves. 
<A NAME="713"></A>Cato, therefore, when he saw the temple of Castor and Pollux encompassed 
<A NAME="714"></A>with armed men, and the steps guarded by gladiators, and at the top Metellus 
<A NAME="715"></A>and Caesar seated together, turning to his friends, "Behold," said he, 
<A NAME="716"></A>"this audacious coward, who has levied a regiment of soldiers against one 
<A NAME="717"></A>unarmed naked man; and so he went on with Thermus. Those who kept the passages 
<A NAME="718"></A>gave way to these two only, and would not let anybody else pass. Yet Cato 
<A NAME="719"></A>taking Munatius by the hand, with much difficulty pulled him through along 
<A NAME="720"></A>with him. Then going directly to Metellus and Caesar, he sat himself down 
<A NAME="721"></A>between them, to prevent their talking to one another, at which they were 
<A NAME="722"></A>both amazed and confounded. And those of the honest party, observing the 
<A NAME="723"></A>countenance, and admiring the high spirit and boldness of Cato, went nearer, 
<A NAME="724"></A>and cried out to him to have courage, exhorting also one another to stand 
<A NAME="725"></A>together, and not betray their liberty nor the defender of 
<A NAME="726"></A>it.
<A NAME="727"></A><BR><BR>Then the clerk took out the bill, but Cato forbade him to read 
<A NAME="728"></A>it, whereupon Metellus took it, and would have read it himself, but Cato 
<A NAME="729"></A>snatched the book away. Yet Metellus, having the decree by heart, began 
<A NAME="730"></A>to recite it without book; but Thermus put his hand to his mouth, and stopped 
<A NAME="731"></A>his speech. Metellus seeing them fully bent to withstand him, and the people 
<A NAME="732"></A>cowed, and inclining to the better side, sent to his house for armed men. 
<A NAME="733"></A>And on their rushing in with great noise and terror, all the rest dispersed 
<A NAME="734"></A>and ran away, except Cato, who alone stood still, while the other party 
<A NAME="735"></A>threw sticks and stones at him from above, until Murena, whom he had formerly 
<A NAME="736"></A>accused, came up to protect him, and holding his gown before him, cried 
<A NAME="737"></A>out to them to leave off throwing; and, in fine, persuading and pulling 
<A NAME="738"></A>him along, he forced him into the temple of Castor and Pollux. Metellus, 
<A NAME="739"></A>now seeing the place clear, and all the adverse party fled out of the forum, 
<A NAME="740"></A>thought he might easily carry his point; so he commanded the soldiers to 
<A NAME="741"></A>retire, and recommencing in an orderly manner, began to proceed to passing 
<A NAME="742"></A>the decree. But the other side having recovered themselves, returned very 
<A NAME="743"></A>boldly, and with loud shouting, insomuch that Metellus's adherents were 
<A NAME="744"></A>seized with a panic, supposing them to be coming with a reinforcement of 
<A NAME="745"></A>armed men, fled every one out of the place. They being thus dispersed, 
<A NAME="746"></A>Cato came in again, and confirmed the courage, and commended the resolution 
<A NAME="747"></A>of the people; so that now the majority were, by all means, for deposing 
<A NAME="748"></A>Metellus from his office. The senate also being assembled, gave orders 
<A NAME="749"></A>once more for supporting Cato, and resisting the motion, as of a nature 
<A NAME="750"></A>to excite sedition and perhaps civil war in the city.
<A NAME="751"></A><BR><BR>But Metellus continued still very bold and resolute; and seeing 
<A NAME="752"></A>his party stood greatly in fear of Cato, whom they looked upon as invincible, 
<A NAME="753"></A>he hurried out of the senate into the forum, and assembled the people, 
<A NAME="754"></A>to whom he made a bitter and invidious speech against Cato, crying out, 
<A NAME="755"></A>he was forced to fly from his tyranny, and this conspiracy against Pompey; 
<A NAME="756"></A>that the city would soon repent their having dishonoured so great a man. 
<A NAME="757"></A>And from hence he started to go to Asia, with the intention, as would he 
<A NAME="758"></A>supposed, of laying before Pompey all the injuries that were done him. 
<A NAME="759"></A>Cato was highly extolled for having delivered the state from this dangerous 
<A NAME="760"></A>tribuneship, and having in some measure defeated, in the person of Metellus, 
<A NAME="761"></A>the power of Pompey; but he was yet more commended when, upon the senate 
<A NAME="762"></A>proceeding to disgrace Metellus and depose him from his office, he altogether 
<A NAME="763"></A>opposed and at length diverted the design. The common people admired his 
<A NAME="764"></A>moderation and humanity, in not trampling wantonly on an enemy whom he 
<A NAME="765"></A>had overthrown, and wiser men acknowledged his prudence and policy in not 
<A NAME="766"></A>exasperating Pompey.
<A NAME="767"></A><BR><BR>Lucullus soon after returned from the war in Asia, the finishing 
<A NAME="768"></A>of which, and thereby the glory of the whole, was thus, in all appearance, 
<A NAME="769"></A>taken out of his hands by Pompey. And he was also not far from losing his 
<A NAME="770"></A>triumph, for Caius Memmius traduced him to the people, and threatened to 
<A NAME="771"></A>accuse him; rather, however, out of love to Pompey, than for any particular 
<A NAME="772"></A>enmity to him. But Cato, being allied to Lucullus, who had married his 
<A NAME="773"></A>sister Servilia, and also thinking it a great injustice, opposed Memmius, 
<A NAME="774"></A>thereby exposing himself to much slander and misrepresentation, insomuch 
<A NAME="775"></A>that they would have turned him out of his office, pretending that he used 
<A NAME="776"></A>his power tyrannically. Yet at length Cato so far prevailed against Memmius 
<A NAME="777"></A>that he was forced to let fall the accusations, and abandon the contest. 
<A NAME="778"></A>And Lucullus having thus obtained his triumph, yet more sedulously cultivated 
<A NAME="779"></A>Cato's friendship, which he looked upon as a great guard and defence for 
<A NAME="780"></A>him against Pompey's power.
<A NAME="781"></A><BR><BR>And now Pompey also returning with glory from the war, and confiding 
<A NAME="782"></A>in the good-will of the people, shown in their splendid reception of him, 
<A NAME="783"></A>thought he should be denied nothing, and sent therefore to the senate to 
<A NAME="784"></A>put off the assembly for the election of consuls, till he could be present 
<A NAME="785"></A>to assist Piso, who stood for that office. To this most of the senators 
<A NAME="786"></A>were disposed to yield; Cato only not so much thinking that this delay 
<A NAME="787"></A>would be of great importance, but, desiring to cut down at once Pompey's 
<A NAME="788"></A>high expectations and designs, withstood his request, and so overruled 
<A NAME="789"></A>the senate that it was carried against him. And this not a little disturbed 
<A NAME="790"></A>Pompey, who found he should very often fail in his projects unless he could 
<A NAME="791"></A>bring over Cato to his interest. He sent, therefore, for Munatius, his 
<A NAME="792"></A>friend; and Cato having two nieces that were marriageable, he offered to 
<A NAME="793"></A>marry the eldest himself, and take the youngest for his son. Some say they 
<A NAME="794"></A>were not his nieces, but his daughters. Munatius proposed the matter to 
<A NAME="795"></A>Cato, in presence of his wife and sisters; the women were full of joy at 
<A NAME="796"></A>the prospect of an alliance with so great and important a person. But Cato, 
<A NAME="797"></A>without delay or balancing, forming his decision at once, answered, "Go, 
<A NAME="798"></A>Munatius, go and tell Pompey that Cato is not assailable on the side of 
<A NAME="799"></A>the women's chamber; I am grateful indeed for the intended kindness, and 
<A NAME="800"></A>so long as his actions are upright, I promise him a friendship more sure 
<A NAME="801"></A>than any marriage alliance, but I will not give hostages to Pompey's glory 
<A NAME="802"></A>against my country's safety." This answer was very much against the wishes 
<A NAME="803"></A>of the women, and to all his friends it seemed somewhat harsh and haughty. 
<A NAME="804"></A>But afterwards, when Pompey, endeavouring to get the consulship for one 
<A NAME="805"></A>of his friends, gave pay to the people for their votes, and the bribery 
<A NAME="806"></A>was notorious, the money being counted out in Pompey's own gardens, Cato 
<A NAME="807"></A>then said to the women, they must necessarily have been concerned in the 
<A NAME="808"></A>contamination of these misdeeds of Pompey, if they had been allied to his 
<A NAME="809"></A>family; and they acknowledged that he did best in refusing it. Yet if we 
<A NAME="810"></A>may judge by the event, Cato was much to blame in rejecting that alliance, 
<A NAME="811"></A>which thereby fell to Caesar. And then that match was made, which, uniting 
<A NAME="812"></A>his and Pompey's power, had well-nigh ruined the Roman empire, and did 
<A NAME="813"></A>destroy the commonwealth. Nothing of which, perhaps, had come to pass, 
<A NAME="814"></A>but that Cato was too apprehensive of Pompey's least faults, and did not 
<A NAME="815"></A>consider how he forced him into conferring on another man the opportunity 
<A NAME="816"></A>of committing the greatest.
<A NAME="817"></A><BR><BR>These things, however, were yet to come. Lucullus and Pompey, meantime, 
<A NAME="818"></A>had a great dispute concerning their orders and arrangements in Pontus, 
<A NAME="819"></A>each endeavouring that his own ordinances might stand. Cato took part with 
<A NAME="820"></A>Lucullus, who was manifestly suffering wrong; and Pompey, finding himself 
<A NAME="821"></A>the weaker in the senate, had recourse to the people, and to gain votes 
<A NAME="822"></A>he proposed a law for dividing the lands among the soldiers. Cato opposing 
<A NAME="823"></A>him in this also made the bill he rejected. Upon this he joined himself 
<A NAME="824"></A>with Clodius, at that time the most violent of all the demagogues, and 
<A NAME="825"></A>entered also into friendship with Caesar, upon an occasion of which also 
<A NAME="826"></A>Cato was the cause. For Caesar, returning from his government in Spain, 
<A NAME="827"></A>at the same time sued to be chosen consul, and yet desired not to lose 
<A NAME="828"></A>his triumph. Now the law requiring that those who stood for any office 
<A NAME="829"></A>should be present, and yet that whoever expected a triumph should continue 
<A NAME="830"></A>without the walls, Caesar requested the senate that his friends might be 
<A NAME="831"></A>permitted to canvass for him in his absence. Many of the senators were 
<A NAME="832"></A>willing to consent to it, but Cato opposed it, and perceiving them inclined 
<A NAME="833"></A>to favour Caesar, spent the whole day in speaking, and so prevented the 
<A NAME="834"></A>senate from coming to any conclusion. Caesar, therefore, resolving to let 
<A NAME="835"></A>fall his pretensions to the triumph, came into the town, and immediately 
<A NAME="836"></A>made a friendship with Pompey, and stood for the consulship. As soon as 
<A NAME="837"></A>he was declared consul elect, he married his daughter Julia to Pompey. 
<A NAME="838"></A>And having thus combined themselves together against the commonwealth, 
<A NAME="839"></A>the one proposed laws for dividing the lands among the poor people, and 
<A NAME="840"></A>the other was present to support the proposals. Lucullus, Cicero, and their 
<A NAME="841"></A>friends, joined with Bibulus, the other consul, to hinder their passing, 
<A NAME="842"></A>and, foremost of them all, Cato, who already looked upon the friendship 
<A NAME="843"></A>and alliance of Pompey and Caesar as very dangerous, declared he did not 
<A NAME="844"></A>so much dislike the advantage the people should get by this division of 
<A NAME="845"></A>the lands, as he feared the reward these men would gain, by thus courting 
<A NAME="846"></A>and cozening the people. And in this he gained over the senate to his opinion, 
<A NAME="847"></A>as likewise many who were not senators, who were offended at Caesar's ill-conduct, 
<A NAME="848"></A>that he, in the office of consul, should thus basely and dishonourably 
<A NAME="849"></A>flatter the people; practising, to win their favour, the same means that 
<A NAME="850"></A>were wont to be used only by the most rash and rebellious tribunes. Caesar, 
<A NAME="851"></A>therefore, and his party, fearing they should not carry it by fair dealing, 
<A NAME="852"></A>fell to open force. First a basket of dung was thrown upon Bibulus as he 
<A NAME="853"></A>was going to the forum; then they set upon his lictors and broke their 
<A NAME="854"></A>rods; at length several darts were thrown, and many men wounded; so that 
<A NAME="855"></A>all that were against those laws fled out of the forum, the rest with what 
<A NAME="856"></A>haste they could, and Cato, last of all, walking out slowly, often turning 
<A NAME="857"></A>back and calling down vengeance upon them.
<A NAME="858"></A><BR><BR>Thus the other party not only carried their point of dividing the 
<A NAME="859"></A>lands, but also ordained that all the senate should swear to confirm this 
<A NAME="860"></A>law, and to defend it against whoever should attempt to alter it, inflicting 
<A NAME="861"></A>great penalties on those that should refuse the oath. All these senators, 
<A NAME="862"></A>seeing the necessity they were in, took the oath, remembering the example 
<A NAME="863"></A>of Metellus in old time, who, refusing to swear upon the like occasion, 
<A NAME="864"></A>was forced to leave Italy. As for Cato, his wife and children with tears 
<A NAME="865"></A>besought him, his friends and familiars persuaded and entreated him, to 
<A NAME="866"></A>yield and take the oath; but he that principally prevailed with him was 
<A NAME="867"></A>Cicero, the orator, who urged upon him that it was perhaps not even right 
<A NAME="868"></A>in itself, that a private man should oppose what the public had decreed; 
<A NAME="869"></A>that the thing being already past altering, it were folly and madness to 
<A NAME="870"></A>throw himself into danger without the chance of doing his country any good; 
<A NAME="871"></A>it would be the greatest of all evils to embrace, as it were, the opportunity 
<A NAME="872"></A>to abandon the commonwealth, for whose sake he did everything, and to let 
<A NAME="873"></A>it fall into the hands of those who designed nothing but its ruin, as if 
<A NAME="874"></A>he were glad to be saved from the trouble of defending it. "For," said 
<A NAME="875"></A>he, "though Cato have no need of Rome, yet Rome has need of Cato, and so 
<A NAME="876"></A>likewise have all his friends." Of whom Cicero professed he himself was 
<A NAME="877"></A>the chief, being at that time aimed at by Clodius, who openly threatened 
<A NAME="878"></A>to fall upon him, as soon as ever he should get to be tribune. Thus Cato, 
<A NAME="879"></A>they say, moved by the entreaties and the arguments of his friends, went 
<A NAME="880"></A>unwillingly to take the oath, which he did the last of all, except only 
<A NAME="881"></A>Favonius, one of his intimate acquaintance.
<A NAME="882"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, exalted with this success, proposed another law, for dividing 
<A NAME="883"></A>almost all the country of Campania among the poor and needy citizens. Nobody 
<A NAME="884"></A>durst speak against it but Cato, whom Caesar therefore pulled from the 
<A NAME="885"></A>rostra and dragged to prison: yet Cato did not even thus remit his freedom 
<A NAME="886"></A>of speech, but as he went along continued to speak against the law, and 
<A NAME="887"></A>advised the people to put down all legislators who proposed the like. The 
<A NAME="888"></A>senate and the best of the citizens followed him with sad and dejected 
<A NAME="889"></A>looks, showing their grief and indignation by their silence, so that Caesar 
<A NAME="890"></A>could not be ignorant how much they were offended; but for contention's 
<A NAME="891"></A>sake he still persisted, expecting Cato should either supplicate him, or 
<A NAME="892"></A>make an appeal. But when he saw that he did not so much as think of doing 
<A NAME="893"></A>either, ashamed of what he was doing and of what people thought of it, 
<A NAME="894"></A>he himself privately bade one of the tribunes interpose and procure his 
<A NAME="895"></A>release. However, having won the multitude by these laws and gratifications, 
<A NAME="896"></A>they decreed that Caesar should have the government of Illyricum, and all 
<A NAME="897"></A>Gaul, with an army of four legions, for the space of five years, though 
<A NAME="898"></A>Cato still cried out they were, by their own vote, placing a tyrant in 
<A NAME="899"></A>their citadel. Publius Clodius, a patrician, who illegally became a plebeian, 
<A NAME="900"></A>was declared tribune of the people, as he had promised to do all things 
<A NAME="901"></A>according to their pleasure, on condition he might banish Cicero. And for 
<A NAME="902"></A>consuls, they set up Calpurnius Piso, the father of Caesar's wife, and 
<A NAME="903"></A>Aulus Gabinius, one of Pompey's creatures, as they tell us, who best knew 
<A NAME="904"></A>his life and manners.
<A NAME="905"></A><BR><BR>Yet when they had thus firmly established all things, having mastered 
<A NAME="906"></A>one part of the city by favour, and the other by fear, they themselves 
<A NAME="907"></A>were still afraid of Cato, and remembered with vexation what pains and 
<A NAME="908"></A>trouble their success over him had cost them, and indeed what shame and 
<A NAME="909"></A>disgrace, when at last they were driven to use violence to him. This made 
<A NAME="910"></A>Clodius despair of driving Cicero out of Italy while Cato stayed at home. 
<A NAME="911"></A>Therefore having first laid his design, as soon as he came into his office, 
<A NAME="912"></A>he sent for Cato, and told him that he looked upon him as the most incorrupt 
<A NAME="913"></A>of all the Romans, and was ready to show he did so. "For whereas," said 
<A NAME="914"></A>he, "many have applied to be sent to Cyprus on the commission in the case 
<A NAME="915"></A>of Ptolemy and have solicited to have the appointment, I think you alone 
<A NAME="916"></A>are deserving of it, and I desire to give you the favour of the appointment." 
<A NAME="917"></A>Cato at once cried out it was a mere design upon him, and no favour, but 
<A NAME="918"></A>an injury. Then Clodius proudly and fiercely answered, "If you will not 
<A NAME="919"></A>take it as a kindness, you shall go, though never so unwillingly;" and 
<A NAME="920"></A>immediately going into the assembly of the people he made them pass a decree, 
<A NAME="921"></A>that Cato should be sent to Cyprus. But they ordered him neither ship, 
<A NAME="922"></A>nor soldier, nor any attendant, except two secretaries, one of whom was 
<A NAME="923"></A>a thief and a rascal, and the other a retainer to Clodius. Besides, as 
<A NAME="924"></A>if Cyprus and Ptolemy were not work sufficient, he was ordered also to 
<A NAME="925"></A>restore the refugees of Byzantium. For Clodius was resolved to keep him 
<A NAME="926"></A>far enough off whilst himself continued tribune.
<A NAME="927"></A><BR><BR>Cato, being in this necessity of going away, advised Cicero, who 
<A NAME="928"></A>was next to be set upon, to make no resistance, lest he should throw the 
<A NAME="929"></A>state into civil war and confusion, but to give way to the times, and thus 
<A NAME="930"></A>become once more the preserver of his country. He himself sent forward 
<A NAME="931"></A>Canidius, one of his friends, to Cyprus, to persuade Ptolemy to yield, 
<A NAME="932"></A>without being forced; which if he did, he should want neither riches nor 
<A NAME="933"></A>honour, for the Romans would give him the priesthood of the goddess at 
<A NAME="934"></A>Paphos. He himself stayed at Rhodes, making some preparations, and expecting 
<A NAME="935"></A>an answer from Cyprus. In the meantime, Ptolemy, King of Egypt, who had 
<A NAME="936"></A>left Alexandria, upon some quarrel between him and his subjects, and was 
<A NAME="937"></A>sailing for Rome, in hopes that Pompey and Caesar would send troops to 
<A NAME="938"></A>restore him, in his way thither desired to see Cato, to whom he sent, supposing 
<A NAME="939"></A>he would come to him. Cato had taken purging medicine at the time when 
<A NAME="940"></A>the messenger came, and made answer, that Ptolemy had better come to him, 
<A NAME="941"></A>if he thought fit. And when he came, he neither went forward to meet him, 
<A NAME="942"></A>nor so much as rose up to him, but saluting him as an ordinary person, 
<A NAME="943"></A>bade him sit down. This at once threw Ptolemy into some confusion, who 
<A NAME="944"></A>was surprised to see such stern and haughty manners in one who made so 
<A NAME="945"></A>plain and unpretending an appearance; but afterwards, when he began to 
<A NAME="946"></A>talk about his affairs, he was no less astonished at the wisdom and freedom 
<A NAME="947"></A>of his discourse. For Cato blamed his conduct, and pointed out to him what 
<A NAME="948"></A>honour and happiness he was abandoning, and what humiliations and troubles 
<A NAME="949"></A>he would run himself into; what bribery he must resort to, and what cupidity 
<A NAME="950"></A>he would have to satisfy when he came to the leading men at Rome, whom 
<A NAME="951"></A>all Egypt turned into silver would scarcely content. He therefore advised 
<A NAME="952"></A>him to return home, and be reconciled to his subjects, offering to go along 
<A NAME="953"></A>with him, and assist him in composing the differences. And by this language 
<A NAME="954"></A>Ptolemy being brought to himself, as it might be out of a fit of madness 
<A NAME="955"></A>or delirium, and discerning the truth and wisdom of what Cato said, resolved 
<A NAME="956"></A>to follow his advice; but he was again over-persuaded by his friends to 
<A NAME="957"></A>the contrary, and so, according to his first design, went to Rome. When 
<A NAME="958"></A>he came there, and was forced to wait at the gate of one of the magistrates, 
<A NAME="959"></A>he began to lament his folly in having rejected, rather, as it seemed to 
<A NAME="960"></A>him, the oracle of a god than the advice merely of a good and 
<A NAME="961"></A>wise.
<A NAME="962"></A><BR><BR>In the meantime, the other Ptolemy, in Cyprus, very luckily for 
<A NAME="963"></A>Cato, poisoned himself. It was reported he had left great riches; therefore, 
<A NAME="964"></A>Cato designing to go first to Byzantium, sent his nephew Brutus to Cyprus, 
<A NAME="965"></A>as he would not wholly trust Canidius. Then, having reconciled the refugees 
<A NAME="966"></A>and the people of Byzantium, he left the city in peace and quietness; and 
<A NAME="967"></A>so sailed to Cyprus, where he found a royal treasure of plate, tables, 
<A NAME="968"></A>precious stones and purple, all which was to be turned into ready money. 
<A NAME="969"></A>And being determined to do everything with the greatest exactness, and 
<A NAME="970"></A>to raise the price of everything to the utmost, to this end he was always 
<A NAME="971"></A>present at selling the things, and went carefully into all the accounts. 
<A NAME="972"></A>Nor would he trust to the usual customs of the market, but looked doubtfully 
<A NAME="973"></A>upon all alike, the officers, criers, purchasers, and even his own friends; 
<A NAME="974"></A>and so in fine he himself talked with the buyers, and urged them to bid 
<A NAME="975"></A>high, and conducted in this manner the greatest part of the 
<A NAME="976"></A>sales.
<A NAME="977"></A><BR><BR>This mistrustfulness offended most of his friends, and in particular, 
<A NAME="978"></A>Munatius, the most intimate of them all, became almost irreconcilable. 
<A NAME="979"></A>And this afforded Caesar the subject of his severest censures in the book 
<A NAME="980"></A>he wrote against Cato. Yet Munatius himself relates, that the quarrel was 
<A NAME="981"></A>not so much occasioned by Cato's mistrust, as by his neglect of him, and 
<A NAME="982"></A>by his own jealousy of Canidius. For Munatius also wrote a book concerning 
<A NAME="983"></A>Cato, which is the chief authority followed by Thrasea. Munatius says, 
<A NAME="984"></A>that coming to Cyprus after the other, and having a very poor lodging provided 
<A NAME="985"></A>for him, he went to Cato's house, but was not admitted, because he was 
<A NAME="986"></A>engaged in private with Canidius; of which he afterwards complained in 
<A NAME="987"></A>very gentle terms to Cato, but received a very harsh answer, that too much 
<A NAME="988"></A>love, according to Theophrastus, often causes hatred; "and you," he said, 
<A NAME="989"></A>"because you bear me much love, think you receive too little honour, and 
<A NAME="990"></A>presently grow angry. I employ Canidius on account of his industry and 
<A NAME="991"></A>his fidelity; he has been with me from the first, and I have found him 
<A NAME="992"></A>to be trusted." These things were said in private between them two; but 
<A NAME="993"></A>Cato afterwards told Canidius what had passed, on being informed of which, 
<A NAME="994"></A>Munatius would no more go to sup with him, and when he was invited to give 
<A NAME="995"></A>his counsel, refused to come. Then Cato threatened to seize his goods, 
<A NAME="996"></A>as was the custom in the case of those who were disobedient; but Munatius 
<A NAME="997"></A>not regarding his threats, returned to Rome, and continued a long time 
<A NAME="998"></A>thus discontented. But afterwards, when Cato was come back also, Marcia, 
<A NAME="999"></A>who as yet lived with him, contrived to have them both invited to sup together 
<A NAME="1000"></A>at the house of one Barca; Cato came in last of all, when the rest were 
<A NAME="1001"></A>laid down, and asked, where he should be. Barca answered him, where he 
<A NAME="1002"></A>pleased; then looking about, he said he would be near Munatius, and went 
<A NAME="1003"></A>and placed himself next to him; yet he showed him no other mark of kindness 
<A NAME="1004"></A>all the time they were at table together. But another time, at the entreaty 
<A NAME="1005"></A>of Marcia, Cato wrote to Munatius that he desired to speak with him. Munatius 
<A NAME="1006"></A>went to his house in the morning and was kept by Marcia till all the company 
<A NAME="1007"></A>was gone; then Cato came, threw both his arms about him, and embraced him 
<A NAME="1008"></A>very kindly they were reconciled. I have the more fully related this passage, 
<A NAME="1009"></A>for that I think the manners and tempers of men are more clearly discovered 
<A NAME="1010"></A>by things of this nature, than by great and conspicuous 
<A NAME="1011"></A>actions.
<A NAME="1012"></A><BR><BR>Cato got together little less than seven thousand talents of silver; 
<A NAME="1013"></A>but apprehensive of what might happen in so long a voyage by sea, he provided 
<A NAME="1014"></A>a great many coffers that held two talents and five hundred drachmas apiece; 
<A NAME="1015"></A>to each of these he fastened a long rope, and to the other end of the rope 
<A NAME="1016"></A>a piece of cork, so that if the ship should miscarry, it might be discovered 
<A NAME="1017"></A>whereabout the chests lay under water. Thus all the money, except a very 
<A NAME="1018"></A>little, was safely transported. But he had made two books, in which all 
<A NAME="1019"></A>the accounts of his commission were carefully written out, and neither 
<A NAME="1020"></A>of these was preserved. For his freedman Philargyrus, who had the charge 
<A NAME="1021"></A>of one of them, setting sail from Cenchreae, was lost, together with the 
<A NAME="1022"></A>ship and all her freight. And the other Cato himself kept safe till he 
<A NAME="1023"></A>came to Corcyra, but there he set up his tent in the market-place, and 
<A NAME="1024"></A>the sailors, being very cold in the night, made a great many fires, some 
<A NAME="1025"></A>of which caught the tents, so that they were burnt, and the book lost. 
<A NAME="1026"></A>And though he had brought with him several of Ptolemy's stewards, who could 
<A NAME="1027"></A>testify to his integrity, and stop the mouths of enemies and false accusers, 
<A NAME="1028"></A>yet the loss annoyed him, and he was vexed with himself about the matter, 
<A NAME="1029"></A>as he had designed them not so much for a proof of his own fidelity, as 
<A NAME="1030"></A>for a pattern of exactness to others.
<A NAME="1031"></A><BR><BR>The news did not fail to reach Rome that he was coming up the river. 
<A NAME="1032"></A>All the magistrates, the priests, and the whole senate, with great part 
<A NAME="1033"></A>of the people, went out to meet him; both the banks of the Tiber were covered 
<A NAME="1034"></A>with people; so that his entrance was in solemnity and honour not inferior 
<A NAME="1035"></A>to a triumph. But it was thought somewhat strange, and looked like willfulness 
<A NAME="1036"></A>and pride, that when the consuls and praetors appeared, he did not disembark 
<A NAME="1037"></A>nor stay to salute them, but rowed up the stream in a royal galley of six 
<A NAME="1038"></A>banks of oars, and stopped not till he brought his vessels to the dock. 
<A NAME="1039"></A>However, when the money was carried through the streets, the people much 
<A NAME="1040"></A>wondered at the vast quantity of it, and the senate being assembled, decreed 
<A NAME="1041"></A>him in honourable terms an extraordinary praetorship, and also the privilege 
<A NAME="1042"></A>of appearing at the public spectacles in a robe faced with purple. Cato 
<A NAME="1043"></A>declined all these honours, but declaring what diligence and fidelity he 
<A NAME="1044"></A>had found in Nicias, the steward of Ptolemy, he requested the senate to 
<A NAME="1045"></A>give him his freedom.
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR><BR>Philippus, the father of Marcia, was that year consul, and the 
<A NAME="1047"></A>authority and power of the office rested in a manner in Cato; for the other 
<A NAME="1048"></A>consul paid him no less regard for his virtue's sake than Philippus did 
<A NAME="1049"></A>on account of the connection between them. And Cicero, now being returned 
<A NAME="1050"></A>from his banishment, into which he was driven by Clodius, and having again 
<A NAME="1051"></A>obtained great credit among the people, went, in the absence of Clodius, 
<A NAME="1052"></A>and by force took away the records of his tribuneship, which had been laid 
<A NAME="1053"></A>up in the capitol. Hereupon the senate was assembled and Clodius complained 
<A NAME="1054"></A>of Cicero, who answered, that Clodius was never legally tribune, and therefore 
<A NAME="1055"></A>whatever he had done was void, and of no authority. But Cato interrupted 
<A NAME="1056"></A>him while he spoke, and at last standing up said, that indeed he in no 
<A NAME="1057"></A>way justified or approved of Clodius's proceedings: but if they questioned 
<A NAME="1058"></A>the validity of what had been done in his tribuneship, they might also 
<A NAME="1059"></A>question what himself had done at Cyprus, for the expedition was unlawful, 
<A NAME="1060"></A>if he that sent him had no lawful authority: for himself, he thought Clodius 
<A NAME="1061"></A>was legally made tribune, who, by permission of the law, was from a patrician 
<A NAME="1062"></A>adopted into a plebeian family; if he had done ill in his office, he ought 
<A NAME="1063"></A>to be called to account for it; but the authority of the magistracy ought 
<A NAME="1064"></A>not to suffer for the faults of the magistrate. Cicero took this ill, and 
<A NAME="1065"></A>for a long time discontinued his friendship with Cato; but they were afterwards 
<A NAME="1066"></A>reconciled.
<A NAME="1067"></A><BR><BR>Pompey and Crassus, by agreement with Caesar, who crossed the Alps 
<A NAME="1068"></A>to see them, had formed a design, that they two should stand to be chosen 
<A NAME="1069"></A>consuls a second time, and when they should be in their office, they would 
<A NAME="1070"></A>continue to Caesar his government for five years more, and take to themselves 
<A NAME="1071"></A>the greatest provinces, with armies and money to maintain them. This seemed 
<A NAME="1072"></A>a plain conspiracy to subvert the constitution and parcel out the empire. 
<A NAME="1073"></A>Several men of high character had intended to stand to be consuls that 
<A NAME="1074"></A>year, but upon the appearance of these great competitors, they all desisted, 
<A NAME="1075"></A>except only Lucius Domitius, who had married Porcia, the sister of Cato, 
<A NAME="1076"></A>and was by him persuaded to stand it out, and not abandon such an undertaking, 
<A NAME="1077"></A>which, he said, was not merely to gain the consulship, but to save the 
<A NAME="1078"></A>liberty of Rome. In the meantime, it was the common topic among the more 
<A NAME="1079"></A>prudent part of the citizens, that they ought not to suffer the power of 
<A NAME="1080"></A>Pompey and Crassus to be united, which would then be carried beyond all 
<A NAME="1081"></A>bounds, and become dangerous to the state; that therefore one of them must 
<A NAME="1082
