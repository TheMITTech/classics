<A NAME="2"></A>
<BR>(legendary, died 272 B.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Of the Thesprotians and Molossians after the great inundation, the first 
<A NAME="11"></A>king, according to some historians, was Phaethon, one of those who came 
<A NAME="12"></A>into Epirus with Pelasgus. Others tell us that Deucalion and Pyrrha, having 
<A NAME="13"></A>set up the worship of Jupiter at Dodona, settled there among the Molossians. 
<A NAME="14"></A>In after time, Neoptolemus, Achilles's son, planting a colony, possessed 
<A NAME="15"></A>these parts himself, and left a succession of kings, who, after him, was 
<A NAME="16"></A>named Pyrrhidae, as he in his youth was called Pyrrhus, and of his legitimate 
<A NAME="17"></A>children, one was born of Lanassa, daughter of Cleodaeus, Hyllus's son, 
<A NAME="18"></A>had also that name. From him Achilles came to have divine honours in Epirus, 
<A NAME="19"></A>under the name of Aspetus, in the language of the country. After these 
<A NAME="20"></A>first kings, those of the following intervening times becoming barbarous, 
<A NAME="21"></A>and insignificant both in their power and their lives, Tharrhypas is said 
<A NAME="22"></A>to have been the first who, by introducing Greek manners and learning, 
<A NAME="23"></A>and humane laws into his cities, left any fame of himself. Alcetas was 
<A NAME="24"></A>the son of Tharrhypas, Arybas of Alcetas, and of Arybas and Troas his queen, 
<A NAME="25"></A>Aeacides; he married Phthia, the daughter of Menon, the Thessalian, a man 
<A NAME="26"></A>of note at the time of the Lamiac war, and of highest command in the confederate 
<A NAME="27"></A>army next to Leosthenes. To Aeacides were born of Phthia, Deidamia and 
<A NAME="28"></A>Troas, daughters, and Pyrrhus, a son.
<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR>The Molossians, afterwards falling into factions and expelling 
<A NAME="30"></A>Aeacides, brought in the sons of Neoptolemus, and such friends of Aeacides 
<A NAME="31"></A>as they could take were all cut off; Pyrrhus, yet an infant, and searched 
<A NAME="32"></A>for by the enemy, had been stolen away and carried off by Androclides and 
<A NAME="33"></A>Angelus; who, however, being obliged to take with them a few servants, 
<A NAME="34"></A>and women to nurse the child, were much impeded and retarded in their flight, 
<A NAME="35"></A>and when they were now overtaken, they delivered the infant to Androcleon, 
<A NAME="36"></A>Hippias, and Neander, faithful and able young fellows, giving them in charge 
<A NAME="37"></A>to make for Megara, a town of Macedon, with all their might, while they 
<A NAME="38"></A>themselves, partly by entreaty, and partly by force, stopped the course 
<A NAME="39"></A>of the pursuers till late in the evening. At last, having hardly forced 
<A NAME="40"></A>them back, they joined those who had the care of Pyrrhus; but the sun being 
<A NAME="41"></A>already set, at the point of attaining their object they suddenly found 
<A NAME="42"></A>themselves cut off from it. For on reaching the river that runs by the 
<A NAME="43"></A>city they found it looking formidable and rough, and endeavouring to pass 
<A NAME="44"></A>over, they discovered it was not fordable; late rains having heightened 
<A NAME="45"></A>the water and made the current violent. The darkness of the night added 
<A NAME="46"></A>to the horror of all, so that they durst not venture of themselves to carry 
<A NAME="47"></A>over the child and the women that attended it; but, perceiving some of 
<A NAME="48"></A>the country people on the other side, they desired them to assist their 
<A NAME="49"></A>passage, and showed them Pyrrhus, calling out aloud, and importuning them. 
<A NAME="50"></A>They, however, could not hear for the noise and roaring of the water. Thus 
<A NAME="51"></A>time was spent while those called out, and the others did not understand 
<A NAME="52"></A>what was said, till one recollecting himself, stripped off a piece of bark 
<A NAME="53"></A>from an oak, and wrote on it with the tongue of a buckle, stating the necessities 
<A NAME="54"></A>and the fortunes of the child, and then rolling it about a stone, which 
<A NAME="55"></A>was made use of to give force to the motion, threw it over to the other 
<A NAME="56"></A>side, or, as some say, fastened it to the end of a javelin, and darted 
<A NAME="57"></A>it over. When the men on the other shore read what was on the bark, and 
<A NAME="58"></A>saw how time pressed, without delay they cut down some trees, and lashing 
<A NAME="59"></A>them together, came over to them. And it so fell out, that he who first 
<A NAME="60"></A>got ashore, and took Pyrrhus in his arms, was named Achilles, the rest 
<A NAME="61"></A>being helped over by others as they came to hand.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR>Thus being safe, and out of the reach of pursuit, they addressed 
<A NAME="63"></A>themselves to Glaucias, then King of the Illyrians, and finding him sitting 
<A NAME="64"></A>at home with his wife, they laid down the child before them. The king began 
<A NAME="65"></A>to weigh the matter, fearing Cassander, who was a mortal enemy of Aeacides, 
<A NAME="66"></A>and, being in deep consideration, said nothing for a long time; while Pyrrhus, 
<A NAME="67"></A>crawling about on the ground, gradually got near and laid hold with his 
<A NAME="68"></A>hand upon the king's robe, and so helping himself upon his feet against 
<A NAME="69"></A>the knees of Glaucias first moved laughter, and then pity, as a little, 
<A NAME="70"></A>humble, crying petitioner. Some say he did not throw himself before Glaucias, 
<A NAME="71"></A>but catching hold of an altar of the gods, and spreading his hands about 
<A NAME="72"></A>it, raised himself up by that; and that Glaucias took the act as an omen. 
<A NAME="73"></A>At present, therefore, he gave Pyrrhus into the charge of his wife, commanding 
<A NAME="74"></A>he should be brought up with his own children; and a little later, the 
<A NAME="75"></A>enemies sending to demand him, and Cassander himself offering two hundred 
<A NAME="76"></A>talents, he would not deliver him up; but when he was twelve years old, 
<A NAME="77"></A>bringing him with an army into Epirus, made him king. Pyrrhus in the air 
<A NAME="78"></A>of his face had something more of the terrors than of the augustness of 
<A NAME="79"></A>kingly power; he had not a regular set of upper teeth, but in the place 
<A NAME="80"></A>of them one continued bone, with small lines marked on it, resembling the 
<A NAME="81"></A>divisions of a row of teeth. It was a general belief he could cure the 
<A NAME="82"></A>spleen by sacrificing a white cock and gently pressing with his right foot 
<A NAME="83"></A>on the spleen of the persons as they lay down on their backs, nor was any 
<A NAME="84"></A>one so poor or inconsiderable as not to be welcome, if he desired it, to 
<A NAME="85"></A>the benefit of his touch. He accepted the cock for the sacrifice as a reward, 
<A NAME="86"></A>and was always much pleased with the present. The large toe of that foot 
<A NAME="87"></A>was said to have a divine virtue; for after his death, the rest of the 
<A NAME="88"></A>body being consumed, this was found unhurt, and untouched by the fire. 
<A NAME="89"></A>But of these things hereafter.
<A NAME="90"></A><BR><BR>Being now about seventeen years old, and the government in appearance 
<A NAME="91"></A>well settled, he took a journey out of the kingdom to attend the marriage 
<A NAME="92"></A>of one of Glaucias's sons, with whom he was brought up; upon which opportunity 
<A NAME="93"></A>the Molossians again rebelling, turned out all of his party, plundered 
<A NAME="94"></A>his property, and gave themselves up to Neoptolemus. Pyrrhus having thus 
<A NAME="95"></A>lost the kingdom, and being in want of all things, applied to Demetrius, 
<A NAME="96"></A>the son of Antigonus, the husband of his sister Deidamia, who, while she 
<A NAME="97"></A>was but a child, had been in name the wife of Alexander, son of Roxana, 
<A NAME="98"></A>but their affairs afterwards proving unfortunate, when she came to age, 
<A NAME="99"></A>Demetrius married her. At the great battle of Ipsus, where so many kings 
<A NAME="100"></A>were engaged, Pyrrhus, taking part with Demetrius, though yet but a youth, 
<A NAME="101"></A>routed those that encountered him, and highly signalized himself among 
<A NAME="102"></A>all the soldiery; and afterwards, when Demetrius's fortunes were low, he 
<A NAME="103"></A>did not forsake him then, but secured for him the cities of Greece with 
<A NAME="104"></A>which he was intrusted; and upon articles of agreement being made between 
<A NAME="105"></A>Demetrius and Ptolemy, he went over as an hostage for him into Egypt, where 
<A NAME="106"></A>both in hunting and other exercises he gave Ptolemy an ample proof of his 
<A NAME="107"></A>courage and strength. Here observing Berenice in greatest power, and of 
<A NAME="108"></A>all Ptolemy's wives highest in esteem for virtue and understanding, he 
<A NAME="109"></A>made his court principally to her. He had a particular art of gaining over 
<A NAME="110"></A>the great to his own interest, as on the other hand he readily overlooked 
<A NAME="111"></A>such as were below him; and being also well-behaved and temperate in his 
<A NAME="112"></A>life, among all the young princes then at court he was thought most fit 
<A NAME="113"></A>to have Antigone for his wife, one of the daughters of Berenice by Philip, 
<A NAME="114"></A>before she married Ptolemy.
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR>After this match, advancing in honour, and Antigone being a very 
<A NAME="116"></A>good wife to him, having procured a sum of money, and raised an army, he 
<A NAME="117"></A>so ordered matters as to be sent into his kingdom of Epirus, and arrived 
<A NAME="118"></A>there to the great satisfaction of many, from their hate to Neoptolemus, 
<A NAME="119"></A>who was governing in a violent and arbitrary way. But fearing lest Neoptolemus 
<A NAME="120"></A>should enter into alliance with some neighbouring princes, he came to terms 
<A NAME="121"></A>and friendship with him, agreeing that they should share the government 
<A NAME="122"></A>between them. There were people, however, who, as time went on, secretly 
<A NAME="123"></A>exasperated them, and fomented jealousies between them. The cause chiefly 
<A NAME="124"></A>moving Pyrrhus is said to have had this beginning. It was customary for 
<A NAME="125"></A>the kings to offer sacrifice to Mars at Passaro, a place in the Molossian 
<A NAME="126"></A>country, and that done to enter into a solemn covenant with the Epirots; 
<A NAME="127"></A>they to govern according to law, these to preserve the government as by 
<A NAME="128"></A>law established. This was performed in the presence of both kings, who 
<A NAME="129"></A>were there with their immediate friends, giving and receiving many presents; 
<A NAME="130"></A>here Gelo, one of the friends of Neoptolemus, taking Pyrrhus by the hand, 
<A NAME="131"></A>presented him with two pair of draught oxen. Myrtilus, his cup-bearer, 
<A NAME="132"></A>being then by, begged these of Pyrrhus, who not giving them to him, but 
<A NAME="133"></A>to another, Myrtilus extremely resented it, which Gelo took notice of, 
<A NAME="134"></A>and, inviting him to a banquet (amidst drinking and other excesses, as 
<A NAME="135"></A>some relate, Myrtilus being then in the flower of his youth), he entered 
<A NAME="136"></A>into discourse, persuading him to adhere to Neoptolemus, and destroy Pyrrhus 
<A NAME="137"></A>by poison. Myrtilus received the design, appearing to approve and consent 
<A NAME="138"></A>to it, but privately discovered it to Pyrrhus, by whose command he recommended 
<A NAME="139"></A>Alexicrates, his chief cup-bearer, to Gelo, as a fit instrument for their 
<A NAME="140"></A>design, Pyrrhus being very desirous to have proof of the plot by several 
<A NAME="141"></A>evidences. So Gelo, being deceived, Neoptolemus, who was no less deceived, 
<A NAME="142"></A>imagining the design went prosperously on, could not forbear, but in his 
<A NAME="143"></A>joy spoke of it among his friends, and once at an entertainment at his 
<A NAME="144"></A>sister Cadmea's talked openly of it, thinking none heard but themselves. 
<A NAME="145"></A>Nor was any one there but Phaenarete the wife of Samon, who had the care 
<A NAME="146"></A>of Neoptolemus's flocks and herds. She, turning her face towards the wall 
<A NAME="147"></A>upon a couch, seemed fast asleep, and having heard all that passed, unsuspected, 
<A NAME="148"></A>next day came to Antigone, Pyrrhus's wife, and told her what she had heard 
<A NAME="149"></A>Neoptolemus say to his sister. On understanding which Pyrrhus for the present 
<A NAME="150"></A>said little, but on a sacrifice day, making an invitation for Neoptolemus, 
<A NAME="151"></A>killed him; being satisfied before that the great men of the Epirots were 
<A NAME="152"></A>his friends, and that they were eager for him to rid himself of Neoptolemus, 
<A NAME="153"></A>and not to content himself with a mere petty share of the government, but 
<A NAME="154"></A>to follow his own natural vocation to great designs, and now when a just 
<A NAME="155"></A>ground of suspicion appeared, to anticipate Neoptolemus by taking him off 
<A NAME="156"></A>first.
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR>In memory of Berenice and Ptolemy he named his son by Antigone, 
<A NAME="158"></A>Ptolemy, and having built a city in the peninsula of Epirus, called it 
<A NAME="159"></A>Berenicis. From this time he began to revolve many and vast projects in 
<A NAME="160"></A>his thoughts; but his first special hope and design lay near home, and 
<A NAME="161"></A>he found means to engage himself in the Macedonian affairs under the following 
<A NAME="162"></A>pretext. Of Cassander's sons, Antipater, the eldest, killed Thessalonica, 
<A NAME="163"></A>his mother, and expelled his brother Alexander, who sent to Demetrius entreating 
<A NAME="164"></A>his assistance, and also called in Pyrrhus; but Demetrius being retarded 
<A NAME="165"></A>by multitude of business, Pyrrhus, coming first, demanded in reward of 
<A NAME="166"></A>his service the districts called Tymphaea and Parauaea in Macedon itself 
<A NAME="167"></A>and of their new conquests, Ambracia, Acarnania, and Amphilochia. The young 
<A NAME="168"></A>prince giving way, he took possession of these countries, and secured them 
<A NAME="169"></A>with good garrisons, and proceeded to reduce for Alexander himself other 
<A NAME="170"></A>parts of the kingdom which he gained from Antipater. Lysimachus, designing 
<A NAME="171"></A>to send aid to Antipater, was involved in much other business, but knowing 
<A NAME="172"></A>Pyrrhus would not disoblige Ptolemy, or deny him anything, sent pretended 
<A NAME="173"></A>letters to him as from Ptolemy, desiring him to give up his expedition, 
<A NAME="174"></A>upon the payment of three hundred talents to him by Antipater. Pyrrhus, 
<A NAME="175"></A>opening the letter, quickly discovered the fraud of Lysimachus; for it 
<A NAME="176"></A>had not the accustomed style of salutation, "The father to the son, health," 
<A NAME="177"></A>but "King Ptolemy to Pyrrhus, the king, health;" and reproaching Lysimachus, 
<A NAME="178"></A>he notwithstanding made a peace, and they all met to confirm it by a solemn 
<A NAME="179"></A>oath upon sacrifice. A goat, a bull, and a ram being brought out, the ram 
<A NAME="180"></A>on a sudden fell dead. The others laughed, but Theodotus the prophet forbade 
<A NAME="181"></A>Pyrrhus to swear, declaring that Heaven by that portended the death of 
<A NAME="182"></A>one of the three kings, upon which he refused to ratify the 
<A NAME="183"></A>peace.
<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR>The affairs of Alexander being now in some kind of settlement, 
<A NAME="185"></A>Demetrius arrived, contrary, as soon appeared, to the desire and indeed 
<A NAME="186"></A>not without the alarm of Alexander. After they had been a few days together, 
<A NAME="187"></A>their mutual jealousy led them to conspire against each other; and Demetrius, 
<A NAME="188"></A>taking advantage of the first occasion, was beforehand with the young king, 
<A NAME="189"></A>and slew him, and proclaimed himself King of Macedon. There had been formerly 
<A NAME="190"></A>no very good understanding between him and Pyrrhus; for besides the inroads 
<A NAME="191"></A>he made into Thessaly, the innate disease of princes, ambition of greater 
<A NAME="192"></A>empire, had rendered them formidable and suspected neighbours to each other, 
<A NAME="193"></A>especially since Deidamia's death; and both having seized Macedon, they 
<A NAME="194"></A>came into conflict for the same object, and the difference between them 
<A NAME="195"></A>had the stronger motives. Demetrius having first attacked the Aetolians 
<A NAME="196"></A>and subdued them, left Pantauchus there with a considerable army, and marched 
<A NAME="197"></A>direct against Pyrrhus, and Pyrrhus, as he thought, against him; but by 
<A NAME="198"></A>mistake of the ways they passed by one another, and Demetrius falling into 
<A NAME="199"></A>Epirus wasted the country, and Pyrrhus, meeting with Pantauchus, prepared 
<A NAME="200"></A>for an engagement. The soldiers fell to, and there was a sharp and terrible 
<A NAME="201"></A>conflict, especially where the generals were. Pantauchus, in courage, dexterity, 
<A NAME="202"></A>and strength of body, being confessedly the best of all Demetrius's captains, 
<A NAME="203"></A>and having both resolution and high spirit, challenged Pyrrhus to fight 
<A NAME="204"></A>hand to hand; on the other side Pyrrhus, professing not to yield to any 
<A NAME="205"></A>king in valour and glory, and esteeming the fame of Achilles more truly 
<A NAME="206"></A>to belong to him for his courage than for his blood, advanced against Pantauchus 
<A NAME="207"></A>through the front of the army. First they used their lances, then came 
<A NAME="208"></A>to a close fight, and managed their swords both with art and force; Pyrrhus 
<A NAME="209"></A>receiving one wound, but returning two for it, one in the thigh and the 
<A NAME="210"></A>other near the neck repulsed and overthrew Pantauchus, but did not kill 
<A NAME="211"></A>him outright, as he was rescued by his friends. But the Epirots exulting 
<A NAME="212"></A>in the victory of their king, and admiring his courage, forced through 
<A NAME="213"></A>and cut in pieces the phalanx of the Macedonians, and pursuing those that 
<A NAME="214"></A>fled, killed many, and took five thousand prisoners.
<A NAME="215"></A><BR><BR>This fight did not so much exasperate the Macedonians with anger 
<A NAME="216"></A>for their loss, or with hatred to Pyrrhus, as it caused esteem and admiration 
<A NAME="217"></A>of his valour, and great discourse of him among those that saw what he 
<A NAME="218"></A>did, and were engaged against him in the action. They thought his countenance, 
<A NAME="219"></A>his swiftness, and his motions expressed those of the great Alexander, 
<A NAME="220"></A>and that they beheld here an image and resemblance of his rapidity and 
<A NAME="221"></A>strength in fight; other kings merely by their purple and their guards, 
<A NAME="222"></A>by the formal bending of their necks and lofty tone of their speech, Pyrrhus 
<A NAME="223"></A>only by arms and in action, represented Alexander. Of his knowledge of 
<A NAME="224"></A>military tactics and the art of a general, and his great ability that way, 
<A NAME="225"></A>we have the best information from the commentaries he left behind him. 
<A NAME="226"></A>Antigonus, also, we are told, being asked who was the greatest soldier, 
<A NAME="227"></A>said, "Pyrrhus, if he lives to be old," referring only to those of his 
<A NAME="228"></A>own time; but Hannibal of all great commanders esteemed Pyrrhus for skill 
<A NAME="229"></A>and conduct the first, Scipio the second, and himself the third, as is 
<A NAME="230"></A>related in the life of Scipio. In a word, he seemed ever to make this all 
<A NAME="231"></A>his thought and philosophy, as the most kingly part of learning: other 
<A NAME="232"></A>curiosities he held in no account. He is reported, when asked at a feast 
<A NAME="233"></A>whether he thought Python or Caphisias the best musician to have said, 
<A NAME="234"></A>Polysperchon was the best soldier, as though it became a king to examine 
<A NAME="235"></A>and understand only such things. Towards his familiars he was mild and 
<A NAME="236"></A>not easily incensed; zealous and even vehement in returning kindnesses. 
<A NAME="237"></A>Thus when Aeropus was dead, he could not bear it with moderation, saying, 
<A NAME="238"></A>he indeed had suffered what was common to human nature, but condemning 
<A NAME="239"></A>and blaming himself, that by puttings off and delays he had not returned 
<A NAME="240"></A>his kindness in time. For our debts may be satisfied to the creditor's 
<A NAME="241"></A>heirs, but not to have made the acknowledgment of received favours, while 
<A NAME="242"></A>they to whom it is due can be sensible of it, afflicts a good and worthy 
<A NAME="243"></A>nature. Some thinking it fit that Pyrrhus should banish a certain ill-tongued 
<A NAME="244"></A>fellow in Ambracia, who had spoken very indecently of him, "Let him rather," 
<A NAME="245"></A>said he, "speak against us here to a few, than rambling about to a great 
<A NAME="246"></A>many." And others who in their wine had made reflections upon him, being 
<A NAME="247"></A>afterward questioned for it, and asked by him whether they had said such 
<A NAME="248"></A>words, on one of the young fellows answering. "Yes, all that, king: and 
<A NAME="249"></A>should have said more if we had had more wine;" he laughed and discharged 
<A NAME="250"></A>them. After Antigone's death, he married several wives to enlarge his interest 
<A NAME="251"></A>and power. He had the daughter of Autoleon, King of the Paeonians, Bircenna, 
<A NAME="252"></A>Bardyllis the Illyrian's daughter, Lanassa, daughter of Agathocles the 
<A NAME="253"></A>Syracusan, who brought with her in dower the city of Corcyra, which had 
<A NAME="254"></A>been taken by Agathocles. By Antigone he had Ptolemy, Alexander by Lanassa, 
<A NAME="255"></A>and Helenus, his youngest son, by Bircenna: he brought them up all in arms, 
<A NAME="256"></A>hot and eager youths, and by him sharpened and whetted to war from their 
<A NAME="257"></A>very infancy. It is said, when one of them, while yet a child, asked him 
<A NAME="258"></A>to which he would leave the kingdom, he replied, to him that had the sharpest 
<A NAME="259"></A>sword, which indeed was much like that tragical curse of Oedipus to his 
<A NAME="260"></A>sons:-
<A NAME="261"></A><BR><BR>"Not by the lot decide,
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>But within the sword the heritage divide." So unsocial and wild-beast-like 
<A NAME="263"></A>is the nature of ambition and cupidity.
<A NAME="264"></A><BR><BR>After this battle Pyrrhus, returning gloriously home, enjoyed his 
<A NAME="265"></A>fame and reputation, and being called "Eagle" by the Epirots, "By you," 
<A NAME="266"></A>said he, "I am an eagle; for how should I not be such, while I have your 
<A NAME="267"></A>arms as wings to sustain me?" A little after, having intelligence that 
<A NAME="268"></A>Demetrius was dangerously sick, he entered on a sudden into Macedonia, 
<A NAME="269"></A>intending only an incursion, and to harass the country; but was very near 
<A NAME="270"></A>seizing upon all, and taking the kingdom without a blow. He marched as 
<A NAME="271"></A>far as Edessa unresisted, great numbers deserting and coming in to him. 
<A NAME="272"></A>This danger excited Demetrius beyond his strength, and his friends and 
<A NAME="273"></A>commanders in a short time got a considerable army together, and with all 
<A NAME="274"></A>their forces briskly attacked Pyrrhus, who, coming only to pillage, would 
<A NAME="275"></A>not stand a fight, but retreating, lost part of his army, as he went off, 
<A NAME="276"></A>by the close pursuit of the Macedonians. Demetrius, however, although he 
<A NAME="277"></A>had easily and quickly forced Pyrrhus out of the country, yet did not slight 
<A NAME="278"></A>him, but having resolved upon great designs, and to recover his father's 
<A NAME="279"></A>kingdom with an army of one hundred thousand men, and a fleet of five hundred 
<A NAME="280"></A>ships, would neither embroil himself with Pyrrhus, nor leave the Macedonians 
<A NAME="281"></A>so active and troublesome a neighbour; and since he had no leisure to continue 
<A NAME="282"></A>the war with him, he was willing to treat and conclude a peace, and to 
<A NAME="283"></A>turn his forces upon the other kings. Articles being agreed upon, the designs 
<A NAME="284"></A>of Demetrius quickly discovered themselves by the greatness of his preparation. 
<A NAME="285"></A>And the other kings, being alarmed, sent to Pyrrhus ambassadors and letters, 
<A NAME="286"></A>expressing their wonder that he should choose to let his own opportunity 
<A NAME="287"></A>pass by, and wait till Demetrius could use his; and whereas he was now 
<A NAME="288"></A>able to chase him out of Macedon, involved in designs and disturbed, he 
<A NAME="289"></A>should expect till Demetrius at leisure, and grown great, should bring 
<A NAME="290"></A>the war home to his own door, and make him fight for his temples and sepulchres 
<A NAME="291"></A>in Molossia; especially having so lately, by his means, lost Corcyra and 
<A NAME="292"></A>his wife together. For Lanassa had taken offence at Pyrrhus for too great 
<A NAME="293"></A>an inclination to those wives of his that were barbarians, and so withdrew 
<A NAME="294"></A>to Corcyra, and desiring to marry some king, invited Demetrius, knowing 
<A NAME="295"></A>of all the kings he was most ready to entertain offers of marriage; so 
<A NAME="296"></A>he sailed thither, married Lanassa, and placed a garrison in the city. 
<A NAME="297"></A>The kings having written thus to Pyrrhus, themselves likewise contrived 
<A NAME="298"></A>to find Demetrius work, while he was delaying and making his preparations. 
<A NAME="299"></A>Ptolemy, setting out with a great fleet, drew off many of the Greek cities. 
<A NAME="300"></A>Lysimachus out of Thrace wasted the upper Macedon; and Pyrrhus, also taking 
<A NAME="301"></A>arms at the same time, marched to Beroea, expecting, as it fell out, that 
<A NAME="302"></A>Demetrius, collecting his forces against Lysimachus, would leave the lower 
<A NAME="303"></A>country undefended. That very night he seemed in his sleep to be called 
<A NAME="304"></A>by Alexander the Great, and approaching saw him sick abed, but was received 
<A NAME="305"></A>with very kind words, and much respect, and promised zealous assistance. 
<A NAME="306"></A>He making bold to reply, "How, sir, can you, being sick, assist me?" "With 
<A NAME="307"></A>my name," said he, and mounting Nisaean horse, seemed to lead the way. 
<A NAME="308"></A>At the sight of this vision he was much assured, and with swift marches 
<A NAME="309"></A>overrunning all the interjacent places, takes Beroea, and making his headquarters 
<A NAME="310"></A>there, reduced the rest of the country by his commanders. When Demetrius 
<A NAME="311"></A>received intelligence of this, and perceived likewise the Macedonians ready 
<A NAME="312"></A>to mutiny in the army, he was afraid to advance further, lest, coming near 
<A NAME="313"></A>Lysimachus, a Macedonian king, and of great fame, they should revolt to 
<A NAME="314"></A>him. So returning, he marched directly against Pyrrhus, as a stranger, 
<A NAME="315"></A>and hated by the Macedonians. But while he lay encamped there near him, 
<A NAME="316"></A>many who came out of Beroea infinitely praised Pyrrhus as invincible in 
<A NAME="317"></A>arms, a glorious warrior, who treated those he had taken kindly and humanely. 
<A NAME="318"></A>Several of these Pyrrhus himself sent privately, pretending to be Macedonians, 
<A NAME="319"></A>and saying, now was the time to be delivered from the severe government 
<A NAME="320"></A>of Demetrius by coming over to Pyrrhus, a gracious prince and a lover of 
<A NAME="321"></A>soldiers. By this artifice a great part of the army was in a state of excitement, 
<A NAME="322"></A>and the soldiers began to look every way about inquiring for Pyrrhus. It 
<A NAME="323"></A>happened he was without his helmet, till understanding they did not know 
<A NAME="324"></A>him, he put it on again, and so was quickly recognized by his lofty crest 
<A NAME="325"></A>and the goat's horns he wore upon it. Then the Macedonians, running to 
<A NAME="326"></A>him, desired to be told his password, and some put oaken boughs upon their 
<A NAME="327"></A>heads, because they saw them worn by the soldiers about him. Some persons 
<A NAME="328"></A>even took the confidence to say to Demetrius himself, that he would be 
<A NAME="329"></A>well advised to withdraw and lay down the government. And he, indeed, seeing 
<A NAME="330"></A>the mutinous movements of the army to be only too consistent with what 
<A NAME="331"></A>they said, privately got away, disguised in a broad hat and a common soldier's 
<A NAME="332"></A>coat. So Pyrrhus became master of the army without fighting, and was declared 
<A NAME="333"></A>King of the Macedonians.
<A NAME="334"></A><BR><BR>But Lysimachus now arriving, and claiming the defeat of Demetrius 
<A NAME="335"></A>as the joint exploit of them both, and that therefore the kingdom should 
<A NAME="336"></A>be shared between them, Pyrrhus, not as yet quite assured of the Macedonians, 
<A NAME="337"></A>and in doubt of their faith, consented to the proposition of Lysimachus, 
<A NAME="338"></A>and divided the country and cities between them accordingly. This was for 
<A NAME="339"></A>the present useful, and prevented a war; but shortly after they found the 
<A NAME="340"></A>partition not so much a peaceful settlement as an occasion of further complaint 
<A NAME="341"></A>and difference. For men whose ambition neither seas, nor mountains, nor 
<A NAME="342"></A>unpeopled deserts can limit, nor the bounds dividing Europe from Asia confine 
<A NAME="343"></A>their vast desires, it would be hard to expect to forbear from injuring 
<A NAME="344"></A>one another when they touch and are close together. These are ever naturally 
<A NAME="345"></A>at war, envying and seeking advantages of one another, and merely make 
<A NAME="346"></A>use of those two words, peace and war, like current coin, to serve their 
<A NAME="347"></A>occasions, not as justice but as expediency suggests, and are really better 
<A NAME="348"></A>men when they openly enter on a war, than when they give to the mere forbearance 
<A NAME="349"></A>from doing wrong, for want of opportunity, the sacred names of justice 
<A NAME="350"></A>and friendship. Pyrrhus was an instance of this; for setting himself against 
<A NAME="351"></A>the rise of Demetrius again, and endeavouring to hinder the recovery of 
<A NAME="352"></A>his power, as it were from a kind of sickness, he assisted the Greeks, 
<A NAME="353"></A>and came to Athens, where, having ascended the Acropolis, he offered sacrifice 
<A NAME="354"></A>to the goddess, and the same day came down again, and told the Athenians 
<A NAME="355"></A>he was much gratified by the good-will and the confidence they had shown 
<A NAME="356"></A>to him; but if they were wise he advised them never to let any king come 
<A NAME="357"></A>thither again, or open their city gates to him. He concluded also a peace 
<A NAME="358"></A>with Demetrius, but shortly after he was gone into Asia, at the persuasion 
<A NAME="359"></A>of Lysimachus, he tampered with the Thessalians to revolt, and besieged 
<A NAME="360"></A>his cities in Greece finding he could better preserve the attachment of 
<A NAME="361"></A>the Macedonians in war than in peace, and being of his own inclination 
<A NAME="362"></A>not much given to rest. At last, after Demetrius had been overthrown in 
<A NAME="363"></A>Syria, Lysimachus, who had secured his affairs, and had nothing to do, 
<A NAME="364"></A>immediately turned his whole forces upon Pyrrhus, who was in quarters at 
<A NAME="365"></A>Edessa, and falling upon and seizing his convoy of provisions, brought 
<A NAME="366"></A>first a great scarcity into the army; then partly by letters, partly by 
<A NAME="367"></A>spreading rumours abroad, he corrupted the principal officers of the Macedonians, 
<A NAME="368"></A>reproaching them that they had made one their master who was both a stranger 
<A NAME="369"></A>and descended from those who had ever been servants to the Macedonians, 
<A NAME="370"></A>and that they had thrust the old friends and familiars of Alexander out 
<A NAME="371"></A>of the country. The Macedonian soldiers being much prevailed upon, Pyrrhus 
<A NAME="372"></A>withdrew himself with his Epirots and auxiliary forces, relinquishing Macedon, 
<A NAME="373"></A>just after the same manner he took it. So little reason have kings to condemn 
<A NAME="374"></A>popular governments for changing sides as suits their interests, as in 
<A NAME="375"></A>this they do but imitate them who are the great instructors of unfaithfulness 
<A NAME="376"></A>and treachery; holding him the wisest that makes the least account of being 
<A NAME="377"></A>an honest man.
<A NAME="378"></A><BR><BR>Pyrrhus having thus retired into Epirus, and left Macedon, fortune 
<A NAME="379"></A>gave him a fair occasion of enjoying himself in quiet, and peaceably governing 
<A NAME="380"></A>his own subjects; but he who thought it a nauseous course of life not to 
<A NAME="381"></A>be doing mischief to others, or receiving some from them, like Achilles, 
<A NAME="382"></A>could not endure repose-
<A NAME="383"></A><BR><BR>" -But sad and languished far,
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>Desiring battle and the shout of war," and gratified his inclination 
<A NAME="385"></A>by the following pretext for new troubles. The Romans were at war with 
<A NAME="386"></A>the Tarentines, who, not being able to go on with the war, nor yet, through 
<A NAME="387"></A>the foolhardiness and the viciousness of their popular speakers, to come 
<A NAME="388"></A>to terms and give it up, proposed now to make Pyrrhus their general, and 
<A NAME="389"></A>engage him in it, as of all the neighbouring kings the most at leisure, 
<A NAME="390"></A>and the most skilful as a commander. The more grave and discreet citizens 
<A NAME="391"></A>opposing these counsels, were partly overborne by the noise and violence 
<A NAME="392"></A>of the multitude; while others, seeing this, absented themselves from the 
<A NAME="393"></A>assemblies; only one Meton, a very sober man, on the day this public decree 
<A NAME="394"></A>was to be ratified, when the people were now seating themselves, came dancing 
<A NAME="395"></A>into the assembly like one quite drunk, with a withered garland and a small 
<A NAME="396"></A>lamp in his hand, and a woman playing on a flute before him. And as in 
<A NAME="397"></A>great multitudes met at such popular assemblies no decorum can be well 
<A NAME="398"></A>observed, some clapped him, others laughed, none forbade him, but called 
<A NAME="399"></A>to the woman to play, and to him to sing to the company, and when they 
<A NAME="400"></A>thought he was going to do so, "'Tis right of you, O men of Tarentum," 
<A NAME="401"></A>he said, "not to hinder any from making themselves merry that have a mind 
<A NAME="402"></A>to it, while it is yet in their power; and if you are wise, you will take 
<A NAME="403"></A>out your pleasure of your freedom while you can, for you must change your 
<A NAME="404"></A>course of life, and follow other diet when Pyrrhus comes to town." These 
<A NAME="405"></A>words made a great impression upon many of the Tarentines, and a confused 
<A NAME="406"></A>murmur went about that he had spoken much to the purpose; but some who 
<A NAME="407"></A>feared they should be sacrificed if a peace were made with the Romans, 
<A NAME="408"></A>reviled the whole assembly for so tamely suffering themselves to be abused 
<A NAME="409"></A>by a drunken sot, and crowding together upon Meton, thrust him out. So 
<A NAME="410"></A>the public order was passed and ambassadors sent into Epirus, not only 
<A NAME="411"></A>in their own names, but in those of all the Italian Greeks, carrying presents 
<A NAME="412"></A>to Pyrrhus, and letting him know they wanted a general of reputation and 
<A NAME="413"></A>experience; and that they could furnish him with large forces of Lucanians, 
<A NAME="414"></A>Messapians, Samnites, and Tarentines, amounting to twenty thousand horse, 
<A NAME="415"></A>and three hundred and fifty thousand foot. This did not only quicken Pyrrhus, 
<A NAME="416"></A>but raised an eager desire for the expedition in the 
<A NAME="417"></A>Epirots.
<A NAME="418"></A><BR><BR>There was one Cineas, a Thessalian, considered to be a man of very 
<A NAME="419"></A>good sense, a disciple of the great orator Demosthenes, who, of all that 
<A NAME="420"></A>were famous at that time for speaking well, most seemed, as in a picture, 
<A NAME="421"></A>to revive in the minds of the audience the memory of his force and vigour 
<A NAME="422"></A>of eloquence; and being always about Pyrrhus, and sent about in his service 
<A NAME="423"></A>to several cities, verified the saying of Euripides, 
<A NAME="424"></A>that
<A NAME="425"></A><BR><BR>" -the force of words
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>Can do whate'er is done by conquering swords." And Pyrrhus was used 
<A NAME="427"></A>to say, that Cineas had taken more towns with his words than he with his 
<A NAME="428"></A>arms, and always did him the honour to employ him in his most important 
<A NAME="429"></A>occasions. This person, seeing Pyrrhus eagerly preparing for Italy, led 
<A NAME="430"></A>him one day when he was at leisure into the following reasonings: "The 
<A NAME="431"></A>Romans, sir, are reported to be great warriors and conquerors of many warlike 
<A NAME="432"></A>nations; if God permit us to overcome them, how should we use our victory?" 
<A NAME="433"></A>"You ask," said Pyrrhus, "a thing evident of itself. The Romans once conquered, 
<A NAME="434"></A>there is neither Greek nor barbarian city that will resist us, but we shall 
<A NAME="435"></A>presently be masters of all Italy, the extent and resources and strength 
<A NAME="436"></A>of which any one should rather profess to be ignorant of than yourself." 
<A NAME="437"></A>Cineas after a little pause, "And having subdued Italy, what shall we do 
<A NAME="438"></A>next?" Pyrrhus not yet discovering his intention, "Sicily," he replied, 
<A NAME="439"></A>"next holds out her arms to receive us, a wealthy and populous island, 
<A NAME="440"></A>and easy to be gained; for since Agathocles left it, only faction and anarchy, 
<A NAME="441"></A>and the licentious violence of the demagogues prevail." "You speak," said 
<A NAME="442"></A>Cineas, "what is perfectly probable, but will the possession of Sicily 
<A NAME="443"></A>put an end to the war?" "God grant us," answered Pyrrhus, "victory and 
<A NAME="444"></A>success in that, and we will use these as forerunners of greater things; 
<A NAME="445"></A>who could forbear from Libya and Carthage then within reach, which Agathocles, 
<A NAME="446"></A>even when forced to fly from Syracuse, and passing the sea only with a 
<A NAME="447"></A>few ships, had all but surprised? These conquests once perfected, will 
<A NAME="448"></A>any assert that of the enemies who now pretend to despise us, any one will 
<A NAME="449"></A>dare to make further resistance?" "None," replied Cineas, "for then it 
<A NAME="450"></A>is manifest we may with such mighty forces regain Macedon, and make an 
<A NAME="451"></A>absolute conquest of Greece; and when all these are in our power what shall 
<A NAME="452"></A>we do then?" Said Pyrrhus, smiling, "We will live at our ease, my dear 
<A NAME="453"></A>friend, and drink all day, and divert ourselves with pleasant conversation." 
<A NAME="454"></A>When Cineas had led Pyrrhus with his argument to this point: "And what 
<A NAME="455"></A>hinders us now, sir, if we have a mind to be merry, and entertain one another, 
<A NAME="456"></A>since we have at hand without trouble all those necessary things, to which 
<A NAME="457"></A>through much blood and great labour, and infinite hazards and mischief 
<A NAME="458"></A>done to ourselves and to others, we design at last to arrive?" Such reasonings 
<A NAME="459"></A>rather troubled Pyrrhus with the thought of the happiness he was quitting, 
<A NAME="460"></A>than any way altered his purpose, being unable to abandon the hopes of 
<A NAME="461"></A>what he so much desired.
<A NAME="462"></A><BR><BR>And first, he sent away Cineas to the Tarentines with three thousand 
<A NAME="463"></A>men; presently after, many vessels for transport of horse, and galleys, 
<A NAME="464"></A>and flat-bottomed boats of all sorts arriving from Tarentum, he shipped 
<A NAME="465"></A>upon them twenty elephants, three thousand horse, twenty thousand foot, 
<A NAME="466"></A>two thousand archers, and five hundred slingers. All being thus in readiness, 
<A NAME="467"></A>he set sail, and being half-way over, was driven by the wind, blowing, 
<A NAME="468"></A>contrary to the season of the year, violently from the north, and carried 
<A NAME="469"></A>from his course, but by the great skill and resolution of his pilots and 
<A NAME="470"></A>seamen, he made the land with infinite labour, and beyond expectation. 
<A NAME="471"></A>The rest of the fleet could not get up, and some of the dispersed ships, 
<A NAME="472"></A>losing the coast of Italy, were driven into the Libyan and Sicilian Sea; 
<A NAME="473"></A>others, not able to double the cape of Japygium, were overtaken by the 
<A NAME="474"></A>night; and, with a boisterous and heavy sea, throwing them upon a dangerous 
<A NAME="475"></A>and rocky shore, they were all very much disabled except the royal galley. 
<A NAME="476"></A>She, while the sea bore upon her sides, resisted with her bulk and strength, 
<A NAME="477"></A>and avoided the force of it, till the wind coming about, blew directly 
<A NAME="478"></A>in their teeth from the shore, and the vessel keeping up with her head 
<A NAME="479"></A>against it, was in danger of going to pieces; yet on the other hand, to 
<A NAME="480"></A>suffer themselves to be driven off to sea again, which was thus raging 
<A NAME="481"></A>and tempestuous, with the wind shifting about every way, seemed to them 
<A NAME="482"></A>the most dreadful of all their present evils. Pyrrhus, rising up, threw 
<A NAME="483"></A>himself overboard. His friends and guards strove eagerly who should be 
<A NAME="484"></A>most ready to help him, but night and the sea, with its noise and violent 
<A NAME="485"></A>surge, made it extremely difficult to do this; so that hardly, when with 
<A NAME="486"></A>the morning the wind began to subside, he got ashore, breathless and weakened 
<A NAME="487"></A>in body, but with high courage and strength of mind resisting his hard 
<A NAME="488"></A>fortune. The Messapians, upon whose shore they were thrown by the tempest, 
<A NAME="489"></A>came up eagerly to help them in the best manner they could; and some of 
<A NAME="490"></A>the straggling vessels that had escaped the storm arrived; in which were 
<A NAME="491"></A>a very few horse, and not quite two thousand foot, and two 
<A NAME="492"></A>elephants.
<A NAME="493"></A><BR><BR>With these Pyrrhus marched straight to Tarentum, where Cineas, 
<A NAME="494"></A>being informed of his arrival, led out the troops to meet him. Entering 
<A NAME="495"></A>the town, he did nothing unpleasing to the Tarentines, nor put any force 
<A NAME="496"></A>upon them, till the ships were all in harbour, and the greatest part of 
<A NAME="497"></A>the army got together; but then perceiving that the people, unless some 
<A NAME="498"></A>strong compulsion was used to them, were not capable either of saving others 
<A NAME="499"></A>or being saved themselves, and were rather intending, while he engaged 
<A NAME="500"></A>for them in the field, to remain at home bathing and feasting themselves, 
<A NAME="501"></A>he first shut up the places of public exercise, and the walks, where, in 
<A NAME="502"></A>their idle way, they fought their country's battles and conducted her campaigns 
<A NAME="503"></A>in their talk; he prohibited likewise all festivals, revels, and drinking 
<A NAME="504"></A>parties as unseasonable, and summoning them to arms, showed himself rigorous 
<A NAME="505"></A>and inflexible in carrying out the conscription for service in the war. 
<A NAME="506"></A>So that many, not understanding what it was to be commanded, left the town, 
<A NAME="507"></A>calling it mere slavery not to do as they pleased. He now received intelligence 
<A NAME="508"></A>that Laevinus, the Roman consul, was upon his march with a great army, 
<A NAME="509"></A>and plundering Lucania as he went. The confederate forces were not come 
<A NAME="510"></A>up to him, yet he thought it impossible to suffer so near an approach of 
<A NAME="511"></A>an enemy, and drew out with his army, but first sent an herald to the Romans 
<A NAME="512"></A>to know if before the war they would decide the differences between them 
<A NAME="513"></A>and the Italian Greeks by his arbitrament and mediation. But Laevinus returning 
<A NAME="514"></A>answer that the Romans neither accepted him as arbitrator nor feared him 
<A NAME="515"></A>as an enemy, Pyrrhus advanced, and encamped in the plain between the cities 
<A NAME="516"></A>of Pandosia and Heraclea, and having notice the Romans were near, and lay 
<A NAME="517"></A>on the other side of the river Siris, he rode up to take a view of them, 
<A NAME="518"></A>and seeing their order, the appointment of the watches, their method and 
<A NAME="519"></A>the general form of their encampment, he was amazed, and addressing one 
<A NAME="520"></A>of his friends next to him: "This order," said he, "Megacles, of the barbarians, 
<A NAME="521"></A>is not at all barbarian in character; we shall see presently what they 
<A NAME="522"></A>can do; and growing a little more thoughtful of the event, resolved to 
<A NAME="523"></A>expect the arriving of the confederate troops. And to hinder the Romans, 
<A NAME="524"></A>if in the meantime they should endeavour to pass the river, he planted 
<A NAME="525"></A>men all along the bank to oppose them. But they, hastening to anticipate 
<A NAME="526"></A>the coming up of the same forces which he had determined to wait for, attempted 
<A NAME="527"></A>the passage with their infantry, where it was fordable, and with the horse 
<A NAME="528"></A>in several places, so that the Greeks, fearing to be surrounded, were obliged 
<A NAME="529"></A>to retreat, and Pyrrhus, perceiving this, and being much surprised, bade 
<A NAME="530"></A>his foot officers draw their men up in line of battle, and continue in 
<A NAME="531"></A>arms, while he himself with three thousand horse advanced, hoping to attack 
<A NAME="532"></A>the Romans as they were coming over, scattered and disordered. But when 
<A NAME="533"></A>he saw a vast number of shields appearing above the water, and the horse 
<A NAME="534"></A>following them in good order, gathering his men in a closer body, himself 
<A NAME="535"></A>at the head of them, he began the charge, conspicuous by his rich and beautiful 
<A NAME="536"></A>armour, and letting it be seen that his reputation had not outgone what 
<A NAME="537"></A>he was able effectually to perform. While exposing his hands and body in 
<A NAME="538"></A>the fight, and bravely repelling all that engaged him, he still guided 
<A NAME="539"></A>the battle with a steady and undisturbed reason, and such presence of mind, 
<A NAME="540"></A>as if he had been out of the action and watching it from a distance, passing 
<A NAME="541"></A>still from point to point, and assisting those whom he thought most pressed 
<A NAME="542"></A>by the enemy. Here Leonnatus the Macedonian, observing one of the Italians 
<A NAME="543"></A>very intent upon Pyrrhus, riding up towards him, and changing places as 
<A NAME="544"></A>he did, and moving as he moved: "Do you see, sir," said he, "that barbarian 
<A NAME="545"></A>on the black horse with white feet? he seems to be one that designs some 
<A NAME="546"></A>great and dangerous thing, for he looks constantly at you, and fixes his 
<A NAME="547"></A>whole attention, full of vehement purpose, on you alone, taking no notice 
<A NAME="548"></A>of others. Be on your guard, sir, against him." "Leonnatus," said Pyrrhus, 
<A NAME="549"></A>"it is impossible for any man to avoid his fate; but neither he nor any 
<A NAME="550"></A>other Italian shall have much satisfaction in engaging with me." While 
<A NAME="551"></A>they were in this discourse, the Italian, lowering his spear and quickening 
<A NAME="552"></A>his horse, rode furiously at Pyrrhus, and run his horse through with his 
<A NAME="553"></A>lance; at the same instant Leonnatus ran his through. Both horses falling, 
<A NAME="554"></A>Pyrrhus's friends surrounded him and brought him off safe, and killed the 
<A NAME="555"></A>Italian, bravely defending himself. He was by birth a Frentanian, captain 
<A NAME="556"></A>of a troop, and named Oplacus.
<A NAME="557"></A><BR><BR>This made Pyrrhus use greater caution, and now seeing his horse 
<A NAME="558"></A>give ground, he brought up the infantry against the enemy, and changing 
<A NAME="559"></A>his scarf and his arms with Megacles, one of his friends, and obscuring 
<A NAME="560"></A>himself, as it were, in his, charged upon the Romans, who received and 
<A NAME="561"></A>engaged him, and a great while the success of the battle remained undetermined; 
<A NAME="562"></A>and it is said there were seven turns of fortune both of pursuing and being 
<A NAME="563"></A>pursued. And the change of his arms was very opportune for the safety of 
<A NAME="564"></A>his person, but had like to have overthrown his cause and lost him the 
<A NAME="565"></A>victory; for several falling upon Megacles, the first that gave him his 
<A NAME="566"></A>mortal wound was one Dexous, who, snatching away his helmet and his robe, 
<A NAME="567"></A>rode at once to Laevinus, holding them up, and saying aloud he had killed 
<A NAME="568"></A>Pyrrhus. These spoils being carried about and shown among the ranks, the 
<A NAME="569"></A>Romans were transported with joy, and shouted aloud; while equal discouragement 
<A NAME="570"></A>and terror prevailed among the Greeks, until Pyrrhus, understanding what 
<A NAME="571"></A>had happened, rode about the army with his face bare, stretching out his 
<A NAME="572"></A>hand to his soldiers, and telling them aloud it was he. At last, the elephants 
<A NAME="573"></A>more particularly began to distress the Romans, whose horses, before they 
<A NAME="574"></A>came near, nor enduring them, went back with their riders; and upon this, 
<A NAME="575"></A>he commanded the Thessalian cavalry to charge them in their disorder, and 
<A NAME="576"></A>routed them with great loss. Dionysius affirms near fifteen thousand of 
<A NAME="577"></A>the Romans fell; Hieronymus, no more than seven thousand. On Pyrrhus's 
<A NAME="578"></A>side, the same Dionysius makes thirteen thousand slain, the other under 
<A NAME="579"></A>four thousand; but they were the flower of his men, and amongst them his 
<A NAME="580"></A>particular friends as well as officers whom he most trusted and made use 
<A NAME="581"></A>of. However, he possessed himself of the Romans' camp which they deserted, 
<A NAME="582"></A>and gained over several confederate cities, and wasted the country round 
<A NAME="583"></A>about, and advanced so far that he was within about thirty-seven miles 
<A NAME="584"></A>of Rome itself. After the fight many of the Lucanians and Samnites came 
<A NAME="585"></A>in and joined him, whom he chid for their delay, but yet he was evidently 
<A NAME="586"></A>well pleased and raised in his thoughts, that he had defeated so great 
<A NAME="587"></A>an army of the Romans with the assistance of the Tarentines 
<A NAME="588"></A>alone.
<A NAME="589"></A><BR><BR>The Romans did not remove Laevinus from the consulship; though 
<A NAME="590"></A>it is told that Caius Fabricius said, that the Epirots had not beaten the 
<A NAME="591"></A>Romans, but only Pyrrhus, Laevinus; insinuating that their loss was not 
<A NAME="592"></A>through want of valour but of conduct; but filled up their legions, and 
<A NAME="593"></A>enlisted fresh men with all speed, talking high and boldly of war, which 
<A NAME="594"></A>struck Pyrrhus with amazement. He thought it advisable by sending first 
<A NAME="595"></A>to make an experiment whether they had any inclination to treat, thinking 
<A NAME="596"></A>that to take the city and make an absolute conquest was no work for such 
<A NAME="597"></A>an army as his was at that time, but to settle a friendship, and bring 
<A NAME="598"></A>them to terms, would be highly honourable after his victory. Cineas was 
<A NAME="599"></A>despatched away, and applied himself to several of the great ones, with 
<A NAME="600"></A>presents for themselves and their ladies from the king; but not a person 
<A NAME="601"></A>would receive any, and answered, as well men as women, that if an agreement 
<A NAME="602"></A>were publicly concluded, they also should be ready, for their parts, to 
<A NAME="603"></A>express their regard to the king. And Cineas, discoursing with the senate 
<A NAME="604"></A>in the most persuasive and obliging manner in the world, yet was not heard 
<A NAME="605"></A>with kindness or inclination, although Pyrrhus offered also to return all 
<A NAME="606"></A>the prisoners he had taken in the fight without ransom, and promised his 
<A NAME="607"></A>assistance for the entire conquest of all Italy, asking only their friendship 
<A NAME="608"></A>for himself, and security for the Tarentines, and nothing further. Nevertheless, 
<A NAME="609"></A>most were well inclined to a peace, having already received one great defeat 
<A NAME="610"></A>and fearing another from an additional force of the native Italians, now 
<A NAME="611"></A>joining with Pyrrhus. At this point Appius Claudius, a man of great distinction, 
<A NAME="612"></A>but who, because of his great age and loss of sight, had declined the fatigue 
<A NAME="613"></A>of public business, after these propositions had been made by the king, 
<A NAME="614"></A>hearing a report that the senate was ready to vote the conditions of peace, 
<A NAME="615"></A>could not forbear, but commanding his servants to take him up, was carried 
<A NAME="616"></A>in his chair through the forum to the senate-house. When he was set down 
<A NAME="617"></A>at the door, his sons and sons-in-law took him up in their arms, and, walking 
<A NAME="618"></A>close round about him, brought him into the senate. Out of reverence for 
<A NAME="619"></A>so worthy a man, the whole assembly was respectfully 
<A NAME="620"></A>silent.
<A NAME="621"></A><BR><BR>And a little after raising up himself: "I bore," said he, "until 
<A NAME="622"></A>this time, the misfortune of my eyes with some impatience, but now while 
<A NAME="623"></A>I hear of these dishonourable motions and resolves of yours, destructive 
<A NAME="624"></A>to the glory of Rome, it is my affliction, that being already blind, I 
<A NAME="625"></A>am not deaf too. Where is now that discourse of yours that became famous 
<A NAME="626"></A>in all the world, that if he, the great Alexander, had come into Italy, 
<A NAME="627"></A>and dared to attack us when we were young men, and our fathers, who were 
<A NAME="628"></A>then in their prime, he had not now been celebrated as invincible, but 
<A NAME="629"></A>either flying hence, or falling here, had left Rome more glorious? You 
<A NAME="630"></A>demonstrate now that all that was but foolish arrogance and vanity, by 
<A NAME="631"></A>fearing Molossians and Chaonians, ever the Macedonian's prey, and by trembling 
<A NAME="632"></A>at Pyrrhus who was himself but a humble servant to one of Alexander's life-guard, 
<A NAME="633"></A>and comes here, not so much to assist the Greeks that inhabit among us, 
<A NAME="634"></A>as to escape from his enemies at home, a wanderer about Italy, and yet 
<A NAME="635"></A>dares to promise you the conquest of it all by that army which has not 
<A NAME="636"></A>been able to preserve for him a little part of Macedon. Do not persuade 
<A NAME="637"></A>yourselves that making him your friend is the way to send him back, it 
<A NAME="638"></A>is the way rather to bring over other invaders from thence, contemning 
<A NAME="639"></A>you as easy to be reduced, if Pyrrhus goes off without punishment for his 
<A NAME="640"></A>outrages on you, but, on the contrary, with the reward of having enabled 
<A NAME="641"></A>the Tarentines and Samnites to laugh at the Romans." When Appius had done, 
<A NAME="642"></A>eagerness for the war seized on every man, and Cineas was dismissed with 
<A NAME="643"></A>this answer, that when Pyrrhus had withdrawn his forces out of Italy, then, 
<A NAME="644"></A>if he pleased, they would treat with him about friendship and alliance, 
<A NAME="645"></A>but while he stayed there in arms, they were resolved to prosecute the 
<A NAME="646"></A>war against him with all their force, though he should have defeated a 
<A NAME="647"></A>thousand Laevinuses. It is said that Cineas, while he was managing this 
<A NAME="648"></A>affair, made it his business carefully to inspect the manners of the Romans, 
<A NAME="649"></A>and to understand their methods of government, and having conversed with 
<A NAME="650"></A>their noblest citizens, he afterwards told Pyrrhus, among other things, 
<A NAME="651"></A>that the senate seemed to him an assembly of kings, and as for the people, 
<A NAME="652"></A>he feared lest it might prove that they were fighting with a Lernaean hydra, 
<A NAME="653"></A>for the consul had already raised twice as large an army as the former, 
<A NAME="654"></A>and there were many times over the same number of Romans able to bear 
<A NAME="655"></A>arms.
<A NAME="656"></A><BR><BR>Then Caius Fabricius came in embassy from the Romans to treat about 
<A NAME="657"></A>the prisoners that were taken, one whom Cineas had reported to be a man 
<A NAME="658"></A>of highest consideration among them as an honest man and a good soldier, 
<A NAME="659"></A>but extremely poor. Pyrrhus received him with much kindness, and privately 
<A NAME="660"></A>would have persuaded him to accept of his gold, not for any evil purpose, 
<A NAME="661"></A>but calling it a mark of respect and hospitable kindness. Upon Fabricius's 
<A NAME="662"></A>refusal, he pressed him no further, but the next day, having a mind to 
<A NAME="663"></A>discompose him, as he had never seen an elephant before, he commanded one 
<A NAME="664"></A>of the largest, completely armed, to be placed behind the hangings, as 
<A NAME="665"></A>they were talking together. Which being done, upon a sign given, the hanging 
<A NAME="666"></A>was drawn aside, and the elephant, raising his trunk over the head of Fabricius, 
<A NAME="667"></A>made an horrid and ugly noise. He, gently turning about and smiling, said 
<A NAME="668"></A>to Pyrrhus, "Neither your money yesterday, nor this beast to-day, makes 
<A NAME="669"></A>any impression upon me." At supper, amongst all sorts of things that were 
<A NAME="670"></A>discoursed of, but more particularly Greece and the philosophers there, 
<A NAME="671"></A>Cineas, by accident, had occasion to speak of Epicurus, and explained the 
<A NAME="672"></A>opinions his followers hold about the gods and the commonwealth, and the 
<A NAME="673"></A>objects of life, placing the chief happiness of man in pleasure, and declining 
<A NAME="674"></A>public affairs as an injury and disturbance of a happy life, removing the 
<A NAME="675"></A>gods afar off both from kindness or anger, or any concern for us at all, 
<A NAME="676"></A>to a life wholly without business and flowing in pleasures. Before he had 
<A NAME="677"></A>done speaking, "O Hercules!" Fabricius cried out to Pyrrhus, "may Pyrrhus 
<A NAME="678"></A>and the Samnites entertain themselves with this sort of opinions as long 
<A NAME="679"></A>as they are in war with us."
<A NAME="680"></A><BR><BR>Pyrrhus, admiring the wisdom and gravity of the man, was the more 
<A NAME="681"></A>transported with desire of making friendship instead of war with the city, 
<A NAME="682"></A>and entreated him, personally, after the peace should be concluded, to 
<A NAME="683"></A>accept of living with him as the chief of his ministers and generals. Fabricius 
<A NAME="684"></A>answered quietly, "Sir, this will not be for your advantage, for they who 
<A NAME="685"></A>now honour and admire you, when they have had experience of me, will rather 
<A NAME="686"></A>choose to be governed by me than by you." Such was Fabricius. And Pyrrhus 
<A NAME="687"></A>received his answer without any resentment or tyrannic passion; nay, among 
<A NAME="688"></A>his friends he highly commended the great mind of Fabricius, and intrusted 
<A NAME="689"></A>the prisoners to him alone, on condition that if the senate should not 
<A NAME="690"></A>vote a peace, after they had conversed with their friends and celebrated 
<A NAME="691"></A>the festival of Saturn, they should be remanded. And, accordingly, they 
<A NAME="692"></A>were sent back after the holidays; it being decreed pain of death for any 
<A NAME="693"></A>that stayed behind.
<A NAME="694"></A><BR><BR>After this Fabricius taking the consulate, a person came with a 
<A NAME="695"></A>letter to the camp written by the king's principal physician, offering 
<A NAME="696"></A>to take off Pyrrhus by poison, and so end the war without further hazard 
<A NAME="697"></A>to the Romans, if he might have a reward proportionable to his service. 
<A NAME="698"></A>Fabricius, hating the villainy of the man, and disposing the other consul 
<A NAME="699"></A>to the same opinion, sent despatches immediately to Pyrrhus to caution 
<A NAME="700"></A>him against the treason. His letter was to this effect: "Caius Fabricius 
<A NAME="701"></A>and Quintus Aemilius consuls of the Romans, to Pyrrhus the king, health. 
<A NAME="702"></A>You seem to have made an ill-judgement both of your friends and enemies; 
<A NAME="703"></A>you will understand by reading this letter sent to us, that you are at 
<A NAME="704"></A>war with honest men, and trust villains and knaves. Nor do we disclose 
<A NAME="705"></A>this to you out of any favour to you, but lest your ruin might bring a 
<A NAME="706"></A>reproach upon us, as if we had ended the war, by treachery, as not able 
<A NAME="707"></A>to do it by force." When Pyrrhus had read the letter and made inquiry into 
<A NAME="708"></A>the treason, he punished the physician, and as an acknowledgment to the 
<A NAME="709"></A>Romans sent to Rome the prisoners without ransom, and again employed Cineas 
<A NAME="710"></A>to negotiate a peace for him. But they, regarding it as at once too great 
<A NAME="711"></A>a kindness from an enemy, and too great a reward for not doing an ill thing 
<A NAME="712"></A>to accept their prisoners so, released in return an equal number of the 
<A NAME="713"></A>Tarentines and Samnites, but would admit of no debate of alliance or peace 
<A NAME="714"></A>until he had removed his arms and forces out of Italy, and sailed back 
<A NAME="715"></A>to Epirus with the same ships that brought him over. Afterwards, his affairs 
<A NAME="716"></A>demanding a second fight, when he had refreshed his men, he decamped, and 
<A NAME="717"></A>met the Romans about the city Asculum, where, however, he was much incommoded 
<A NAME="718"></A>by a woody country unfit for his horse, and a swift river, so that the 
<A NAME="719"></A>elephants, for want of sure treading, could not get up with the infantry. 
<A NAME="720"></A>After many wounded and many killed, night put an end to the engagement. 
<A NAME="721"></A>Next day, designing to make the fight on even ground, and have the elephants 
<A NAME="722"></A>among the thickest of the enemy, he caused a detachment to possess themselves 
<A NAME="723"></A>of those incommodious grounds, and, mixing slingers and archers among the 
<A NAME="724"></A>elephants, with full strength and courage, he advanced in a close and well-ordered 
<A NAME="725"></A>body. The Romans, not having those advantages of retreating and falling 
<A NAME="726"></A>on as they pleased, which they had before, were obliged to fight man to 
<A NAME="727"></A>man upon plain ground, and, being anxious to drive back the infantry before 
<A NAME="728"></A>the elephants could get up, they fought fiercely with their swords among 
<A NAME="729"></A>the Macedonian spears, not sparing themselves, thinking only to wound and 
<A NAME="730"></A>kill, without regard to what they suffered. After a long and obstinate 
<A NAME="731"></A>fight, the first giving ground is reported to have been where Pyrrhus himself 
<A NAME="732"></A>engaged with extraordinary courage; but they were most carried away by 
<A NAME="733"></A>the overwhelming force of the elephants, not being able to make use of 
<A NAME="734"></A>their valour, but overthrown as it were by the irruption of a sea or an 
<A NAME="735"></A>earthquake, before which it seemed better to give way than to die without 
<A NAME="736"></A>doing anything, and not gain the least advantage by suffering the utmost 
<A NAME="737"></A>extremity, the retreat to their camp not being far. Hieronymus says there 
<A NAME="738"></A>fell six thousand of the Romans, and of Pyrrhus's men, the king's own commentaries 
<A NAME="739"></A>reported three thousand five hundred and fifty lost in this action. Dionysius, 
<A NAME="740"></A>however, neither gives any account of two engagements at Asculum, nor allows 
<A NAME="741"></A>the Romans to have been certainly beaten, stating that once only after 
<A NAME="742"></A>they had fought till sunset, both armies were unwillingly separated by 
<A NAME="743"></A>the night, Pyrrhus being wounded by a javelin in the arm, and his baggage 
<A NAME="744"></A>plundered by the Samnites, that in all there died of Pyrrhus's men and 
<A NAME="745"></A>the Romans above fifteen thousand. The armies separated; and, it is said, 
<A NAME="746"></A>Pyrrhus replied to one that gave him joy of his victory that one other 
<A NAME="747"></A>such would utterly undo him. For he had lost a great part of the forces 
<A NAME="748"></A>he brought with him, and almost all his particular friends and principal 
<A NAME="749"></A>commanders; there were no others there to make recruits, and he found the 
<A NAME="750"></A>confederates in Italy backward. On the other hand, as from a fountain continually 
<A NAME="751"></A>flowing out of the city, the Roman camp was quickly and plentifully filled 
<A NAME="752"></A>up with fresh men, not at all abating in courage for the loss they sustained, 
<A NAME="753"></A>but even from their very anger gaining new force and resolution to go on 
<A NAME="754"></A>with the war.
<A NAME="755"></A><BR><BR>Among these difficulties he fell again into new hopes and projects 
<A NAME="756"></A>distracting his purposes. For at the same time some persons arrived from 
<A NAME="757"></A>Sicily, offering into his hands the cities of Agrigentum, Syracuse, and 
<A NAME="758"></A>Leontini, and begging his assistance to drive out the Carthaginians and 
<A NAME="759"></A>rid the island of tyrants; and others brought him news out of Greece that 
<A NAME="760"></A>Ptolemy, called Ceranus, was slain in a fight, and his army cut in pieces 
<A NAME="761"></A>by the Gauls, and that now, above all others, was his time to offer himself 
<A NAME="762"></A>to the Macedonians, in great need of a king. Complaining much of fortune 
<A NAME="763"></A>for bringing him so many occasions of great things all together at a time, 
<A NAME="764"></A>and thinking that to have both offered to him was to lose one of them, 
<A NAME="765"></A>he was doubtful, balancing in his thoughts. But the affairs of Sicily seeming 
<A NAME="766"></A>to hold out the greater prospects, Africa lying so near, he turned himself 
<A NAME="767"></A>to them, and presently despatched away Cineas, as he used to do, to make 
<A NAME="768"></A>terms beforehand with the cities. Then he placed a garrison in Tarentum, 
<A NAME="769"></A>much to the Tarentines' discontent, who required him either to perform 
<A NAME="770"></A>what he came for, and continue with them in a war against the Romans, or 
<A NAME="771"></A>leave the city as he found it. He returned no pleasing answer, but commanded 
<A NAME="772"></A>them to be quiet and attend his time, and so sailed away. Being arrived 
<A NAME="773"></A>in Sicily, what he had designed in his hopes was confirmed effectually, 
<A NAME="774"></A>and the cities frankly surrendered to him; and wherever his arms and force 
<A NAME="775"></A>were necessary, nothing at first made any considerable resistance. For 
<A NAME="776"></A>advancing with thirty thousand foot, and twenty-five hundred horse, and 
<A NAME="777"></A>two hundred ships, he totally routed the Phoenicians, and overran their 
<A NAME="778"></A>whole province, and Eryx being the strongest town they held, and having 
<A NAME="779"></A>a great garrison in it, he resolved to take it by storm. The army being 
<A NAME="780"></A>in readiness to give the assault, he put on his arms, and coming to the 
<A NAME="781"></A>head of his men made a vow of plays and sacrifices in honour to Hercules, 
<A NAME="782"></A>if he signalized himself in that day's action before the Greeks that dwelt 
<A NAME="783"></A>in Sicily, as became his great descent and his fortunes. The sign being 
<A NAME="784"></A>given by sound of trumpet, he first scattered the barbarians with his shot, 
<A NAME="785"></A>and then brought his ladders to the wall, and was the first that mounted 
<A NAME="786"></A>upon it himself, and, the enemy appearing in great numbers, he beat them 
<A NAME="787"></A>back; some he threw down from the walls on each side, others he laid dead 
<A NAME="788"></A>in a heap round about him with his sword, nor did he receive the least 
<A NAME="789"></A>wound, but by his very aspect inspired terror in the enemy; and gave a 
<A NAME="790"></A>clear demonstration that Homer was in the right, and pronounced according 
<A NAME="791"></A>to the truth of fact, that fortitude alone, of all the virtues, is wont 
<A NAME="792"></A>to display itself in divine transports and frenzies. The being taken, he 
<A NAME="793"></A>offered to Hercules most magnificently, and exhibited all varieties of 
<A NAME="794"></A>shows and plays.
<A NAME="795"></A><BR><BR>A sort of barbarous people about Messena, called Mamertines, gave 
<A NAME="796"></A>much trouble to the Greeks, and put several of them under contribution. 
<A NAME="797"></A>These being numerous and valiant (from whence they had their name, equivalent 
<A NAME="798"></A>in the Latin tongue to warlike,*) he first intercepted the collectors of 
<A NAME="799"></A>the contribution money, and cut them off, then beat them in open fight, 
<A NAME="800"></A>and destroyed many of their places of strength. The Carthaginians being 
<A NAME="801"></A>now inclined to composition, and offering him a round sum of money, and 
<A NAME="802"></A>to furnish him with shipping, if a peace were concluded, he told them plainly, 
<A NAME="803"></A>aspiring still to greater things, there was but one way for a friendship 
<A NAME="804"></A>and right understanding between them, if they, wholly abandoning Sicily, 
<A NAME="805"></A>would consent to make the African sea the limit between them and the Greeks. 
<A NAME="806"></A>And being elevated with his good fortune, and the strength of his forces, 
<A NAME="807"></A>and pursuing those hopes in prospect of which he first sailed thither, 
<A NAME="808"></A>his immediate aim was at Africa; and as he had abundance of shipping, but 
<A NAME="809"></A>very ill equipped, he collected seamen, not by fair and gentle dealing 
<A NAME="810"></A>with the cities, but by force in a haughty and insolent way, and menacing 
<A NAME="811"></A>them with punishments. And as at first he had not acted thus, but had been 
<A NAME="812"></A>unusually indulgent and kind, ready to believe, and uneasy to none; now 
<A NAME="813"></A>of a popular leader becoming a tyrant by these severe proceedings, he got 
<A NAME="814"></A>the name of an ungrateful and a faithless man. However, they gave way to 
<A NAME="815"></A>these things as necessary, although they took them very ill from him; and 
<A NAME="816"></A>especially when he began to show suspicion of Thoenon and Sosistratus, 
<A NAME="817"></A>men of the first position in Syracuse, who invited him over into Sicily, 
<A NAME="818"></A>and when he was come, put the cities into his power, and were most instrumental 
<A NAME="819"></A>in all he had done there since his arrival, whom he now would neither suffer 
<A NAME="820"></A>to be about his person, nor leave at home; and when Sosistratus out of 
<A NAME="821"></A>fear withdrew himself, and then he charged Thoenon, as in a conspiracy 
<A NAME="822"></A>with the other, and put him to death, with this all his prospects changed, 
<A NAME="823"></A>not by little and little, nor in a single place only, but a mortal hatred 
<A NAME="824"></A>being raised in the cities against him, some fell off to the Carthaginians, 
<A NAME="825"></A>others called in the Mamertines. And seeing revolts in all places, and 
<A NAME="826"></A>desires of alteration, and a potent faction against him, at the same time 
<A NAME="827"></A>he received letters from the Samnites and Tarentines, who were beaten quite 
<A NAME="828"></A>out of the field, and scarce able to secure their towns against the war, 
<A NAME="829"></A>earnestly begging his help. This served as a colour to make his relinquishing 
<A NAME="830"></A>Sicily no flight, nor a despair of good success; but in truth not being 
<A NAME="831"></A>able to manage Sicily, which was as a ship labouring in a storm, and willing 
<A NAME="832"></A>to be out of her, he suddenly threw himself over into Italy. It is reported 
<A NAME="833"></A>that at his going off he looked back upon the island, and said to those 
<A NAME="834"></A>about him, "How brave a field of war do we leave, my friends, for the Romans 
<A NAME="835"></A>and Carthaginians to fight in," which, as he then conjectured, fell out 
<A NAME="836"></A>indeed not long after.
<A NAME="837"></A><BR><BR><B> Mamers being another and older form for Mars. The 
<A NAME="838"></A>Mamertines</B>
<A NAME="839"></A>were descended from Campanian or Oscan mercenaries and spoke a kind of 
<A NAME="840"></A>Latin.
<A NAME="841"></A><BR><BR>When he was sailing off, the barbarians having conspired together, 
<A NAME="842"></A>he was forced to a fight with the Carthaginians in the very road, and lost 
<A NAME="843"></A>many of his ships; with the rest he fled into Italy. There, about one thousand 
<A NAME="844"></A>Mamertines, who had crossed the sea a little before, though afraid to engage 
<A NAME="845"></A>him in open field, setting upon him where the passages were difficult, 
<A NAME="846"></A>put the whole army in confusion. Two elephants fell, and a great part of 
<A NAME="847"></A>his rear was cut off. He, therefore, coming up in person, repulsed the 
<A NAME="848"></A>enemy, but ran into great danger among men long trained and bold in war. 
<A NAME="849"></A>His being wounded in the head with a sword, and retiring a little out of 
<A NAME="850"></A>the fight, much increased their confidence, and one of them advancing a 
<A NAME="851"></A>good way before the rest, large of body and in bright armour, with an haughty 
<A NAME="852"></A>voice challenged him to come forth if he were alive. Pyrrhus, in great 
<A NAME="853"></A>anger, broke away violently from his guards, and, in his fury, besmeared 
<A NAME="854"></A>with blood, terrible to look upon, made his way through his own men, and 
<A NAME="855"></A>struck the barbarian on the head with his sword such a blow, as with the 
<A NAME="856"></A>strength of his arm, and the excellent temper of the weapon, passed downward 
<A NAME="857"></A>so far that his body being cut asunder fell in two pieces. This stopped 
<A NAME="858"></A>the course of the barbarians, amazed and confounded at Pyrrhus, as one 
<A NAME="859"></A>more than man; so that continuing his march all the rest of the way undisturbed, 
<A NAME="860"></A>he arrived at Tarentum with twenty thousand foot and three thousand horse, 
<A NAME="861"></A>where, reinforcing himself with the choicest troops of the Tarentines, 
<A NAME="862"></A>he advanced immediately against the Romans, who then lay encamped in the 
<A NAME="863"></A>territories of the Samnites, whose affairs were extremely shattered, and 
<A NAME="864"></A>their counsels broken, having been in many fights beaten by the Romans. 
<A NAME="865"></A>There was also a discontent amongst them at Pyrrhus for his expedition 
<A NAME="866"></A>into Sicily, so that not many came in to join him.
<A NAME="867"></A><BR><BR>He divided his army into two parts, and despatched the first into 
<A NAME="868"></A>Lucania to oppose one of the consuls there, so that he should not come 
<A NAME="869"></A>in to assist the other; the rest he led against Manius Curius, who had 
<A NAME="870"></A>posted himself very advantageously near Beneventum, and expected the other 
<A NAME="871"></A>consul's forces, and partly because the priests had dissuaded him by unfavourable 
<A NAME="872"></A>omens, was resolved to remain inactive. Pyrrhus, hastening to attack these 
<A NAME="873"></A>before the other could arrive, with his best men, and the most serviceable 
<A NAME="874"></A>elephants, marched in the night toward their camp. But being forced to 
<A NAME="875"></A>go round about, and through a very woody country, their lights failed them, 
<A NAME="876"></A>and the soldiers lost their way. A council of war being called, while they 
<A NAME="877"></A>were in debate, the night was spent, and, at the break of day, his approach, 
<A NAME="878"></A>as he came down the hills, was discovered by the enemy, and put the whole 
<A NAME="879"></A>camp into disorder and tumult. But the sacrifices being auspicious, and 
<A NAME="880"></A>the time absolutely obliging them to fight, Manius drew his troops out 
<A NAME="881"></A>of the trenches, and attacked the vanguard, and, having routed them all, 
<A NAME="882"></A>put the whole army into consternation, so that many were cut off and some 
<A NAME="883"></A>of the elephants taken. This success drew on Manius into the level plain, 
<A NAME="884"></A>and here, in open battle, he defeated part of the enemy; but, in other 
<A NAME="885"></A>quarters, finding himself overpowered by the elephants and forced back 
<A NAME="886"></A>to his trenches, he commanded out those who were left to guard them, a 
<A NAME="887"></A>numerous body, standing thick at the ramparts, all in arms and fresh. These 
<A NAME="888"></A>coming down from their strong position, and charging the elephants, forced 
<A NAME="889"></A>them to retire; and they in the flight turning back upon their own men, 
<A NAME="890"></A>caused great disorder and confusion, and gave into the hands of the Romans 
<A NAME="891"></A>the victory and the future supremacy. Having obtained from these efforts, 
<A NAME="892"></A>and these contests, the feeling as well as the fame of invincible strength, 
<A NAME="893"></A>they at once reduced Italy under their power, and not long after Sicily 
<A NAME="894"></A>too.
<A NAME="895"></A><BR><BR>Thus fell Pyrrhus from his Italian and Sicilian hopes, after he 
<A NAME="896"></A>had consumed six years in these wars, and though unsuccessful in his affairs, 
<A NAME="897"></A>yet preserved his courage unconquerable among all these misfortunes, and 
<A NAME="898"></A>was held, for military experience, and personal valour and enterprise, 
<A NAME="899"></A>much the bravest of all the princes of his time, only what he got by great 
<A NAME="900"></A>actions he lost again by vain hopes, and by new desires of what he had 
<A NAME="901"></A>not, kept nothing of what he had. So that Antigonus used to compare him 
<A NAME="902"></A>to a player with dice, who had excellent throws, but knew not how to use 
<A NAME="903"></A>them. He returned into Epirus with eight thousand foot and five hundred 
<A NAME="904"></A>horse, and for want of money to pay them, was fain to look out for a new 
<A NAME="905"></A>war to maintain the army. Some of the Gauls joining him, he invaded Macedonia, 
<A NAME="906"></A>where Antigonus, son of Demetrius, governed, designing merely to plunder 
<A NAME="907"></A>and waste the country. But after he had made himself master of several 
<A NAME="908"></A>towns, and two thousand men came over to him, he began to hope for something 
<A NAME="909"></A>greater, and adventured upon Antigonus himself, and meeting him at a narrow 
<A NAME="910"></A>passage, put the whole army in disorder. The Gauls, who brought up Antigonus's 
<A NAME="911"></A>rear, were very numerous and stood firm, but after a sharp encounter, the 
<A NAME="912"></A>greatest part of them were cut off, and they who had the charge of the 
<A NAME="913"></A>elephants being surrounded every way, delivered up both themselves and 
<A NAME="914"></A>the beasts, Pyrrhus, taking this advantage, and advising more with his 
<A NAME="915"></A>good fortune than his reason, boldly set upon the main body of the Macedonian 
<A NAME="916"></A>foot, already surprised with fear, and troubled at the former loss. They 
<A NAME="917"></A>declined any action or engagement with him; and he, holding out his hand 
<A NAME="918"></A>and calling aloud both to the superior and under officers by name, brought 
<A NAME="919"></A>over the foot from Antigonus, who, flying away secretly, was only able 
<A NAME="920"></A>to retain some of the seaport towns. Pyrrhus, among all these kindnesses 
<A NAME="921"></A>of fortune, thinking what he had effected against the Gauls the most advantageous 
<A NAME="922"></A>for his glory, hung up their richest and goodliest spoils in the temple 
<A NAME="923"></A>of Minerva Itonis, with this inscription:-
<A NAME="924"></A><BR><BR>"Pyrrhus, descendant of Molossian kings,
<A NAME="925"></A><BR>These shields to thee, Itonian goddess, brings,
<A NAME="926"></A><BR>Won from the valiant Gaul when in the fight
<A NAME="927"></A><BR>Antigonus and all his host took flight;
<A NAME="928"></A><BR>'Tis not to-day or yesterday alone
<A NAME="929"></A><BR>That for brave deeds the Aeacidae are known." After this victory in 
<A NAME="930"></A>the field, he proceeded to secure the cities, and having possessed himself 
<A NAME="931"></A>of Aegae, beside other hardships put upon the people there, he left in 
<A NAME="932"></A>the town a garrison of Gauls, some of those in his own army, who being 
<A NAME="933"></A>insatiably desirous of wealth, instantly dug up the tombs of the kings 
<A NAME="934"></A>that lay buried there, and took away the riches, and insolently scattered 
<A NAME="935"></A>about their bones. Pyrrhus, in appearance, made no great matter of it, 
<A NAME="936"></A>either deferring it on account of the pressure of other business, or wholly 
<A NAME="937"></A>passing it by, out of fear of punishing those barbarians; but this made 
<A NAME="938"></A>him very ill spoken of among the Macedonians, and his affairs being yet 
<A NAME="939"></A>unsettled and brought to no firm consistence, he began to entertain new 
<A NAME="940"></A>hopes and projects, and in raillery called Antigonus a shameless man, for 
<A NAME="941"></A>still wearing his purple and not changing it for an ordinary dress; but 
<A NAME="942"></A>upon Cleonymus, the Spartan, arriving and inviting him to Lacedaemon, he 
<A NAME="943"></A>frankly embraced the overture. Cleonymus was of royal descent, but seeming 
<A NAME="944"></A>too arbitrary and absolute, had no great respect nor credit at home; and 
<A NAME="945"></A>Areus was king there. This was the occasion of an old and public grudge 
<A NAME="946"></A>between him and the citizens; but, beside that, Cleonymus, in his old age, 
<A NAME="947"></A>had married a young lady of great beauty and royal blood, Chilonis, daughter 
<A NAME="948"></A>of Leotychides, who, falling desperately in love with Acrotatus, Areus's 
<A NAME="949"></A>son, a youth in the flower of manhood, rendered this match both uneasy 
<A NAME="950"></A>and dishonourable to Cleonymus, as there was none of the Spartans who did 
<A NAME="951"></A>not very well know how much his wife slighted him; so these domestic troubles 
<A NAME="952"></A>added to his public discontent. He brought Pyrrhus to Sparta with an army 
<A NAME="953"></A>of twenty-five thousand foot, two thousand horse, and twenty-four elephants. 
<A NAME="954"></A>So great a preparation made it evident to the whole world that he came, 
<A NAME="955"></A>not so much to gain Sparta for Cleonymus, as to take all Peloponnesus for 
<A NAME="956"></A>himself, although he expressly denied this to the Lacedaemonian ambassadors 
<A NAME="957"></A>that came to him at Megalopolis, affirming he came to deliver the cities 
<A NAME="958"></A>from the slavery of Antigonus, and declaring he would send his younger 
<A NAME="959"></A>sons to Sparta, if he might, to be brought up in Spartan habits, that so 
<A NAME="960"></A>they might be better bred than all other kings. With these pretensions 
<A NAME="961"></A>amusing those who came to meet him in his march, as soon as ever he entered 
<A NAME="962"></A>Laconia he began to plunder and waste the country, and on the ambassadors 
<A NAME="963"></A>complaining that he began the war upon them before it was proclaimed: "We 
<A NAME="964"></A>know," said he, "very well that neither do you Spartans, when you design 
<A NAME="965"></A>anything, talk of it beforehand." One Mandroclidas, then present, told 
<A NAME="966"></A>him, in the broad Spartan dialect: "If you are a god, you will do us no 
<A NAME="967"></A>harm, we are wronging no man; but if you are a man, there may be another 
<A NAME="968"></A>stronger than you.
<A NAME="969"></A><BR><BR>He now marched away directly for Lacedaemon, and being advised 
<A NAME="970"></A>by Cleonymus to give the assault as soon as he arrived, fearing, as it 
<A NAME="971"></A>is said, lest the soldiers, entering by night, should plunder the city, 
<A NAME="972"></A>he answered, they might do it as well next morning, because there were 
<A NAME="973"></A>but few soldiers in town, and those unprovided against his sudden approach, 
<A NAME="974"></A>as Areus was not there in person, but gone to aid the Gortynians in Crete. 
<A NAME="975"></A>And it was this alone that saved the town, because he despised it as not 
<A NAME="976"></A>tenable, and so imagining no defence would be made, he sat down before 
<A NAME="977"></A>it that night. Cleonymus's friends, and the Helots, his domestic servants, 
<A NAME="978"></A>had made great preparation at his house, as expecting Pyrrhus there at 
<A NAME="979"></A>supper. In the night the Lacedaemonians held a consultation to ship over 
<A NAME="980"></A>all the women into Crete, but they unanimously refused, and Archidamia 
<A NAME="981"></A>came into the senate with a sword in her hand, in the name of them all, 
<A NAME="982"></A>asking if the men expected the women to survive the ruins of Sparta. It 
<A NAME="983"></A>was next resolved to draw a trench in a line directly over against the 
<A NAME="984"></A>enemy's camp, and, here and there in it, to sink wagons in the ground, 
<A NAME="985"></A>as deep as the naves of the wheel, that, so being firmly fixed, they might 
<A NAME="986"></A>obstruct the passage of the elephants. When they had just begun the work, 
<A NAME="987"></A>both maids and women came to them, the married women with their robes tied 
<A NAME="988"></A>like girdles round their underfrocks, and the unmarried girls in their 
<A NAME="989"></A>single frocks only, to assist the elder men at the work. As for the youth 
<A NAME="990"></A>that were next day to engage, they left them to their rest, and undertaking 
<A NAME="991"></A>their proportion, they themselves finished a third part of the trench which 
<A NAME="992"></A>was in breadth six cubits, four in depth, and eight hundred feet long, 
<A NAME="993"></A>as Phylarchus says; Hieronymus makes it somewhat less. The enemy beginning 
<A NAME="994"></A>to move by break of day, they brought their arms to the young men, and 
<A NAME="995"></A>giving them also in charge the trench, exhorted them to defend and keep 
<A NAME="996"></A>it bravely, as it would be happy for them to conquer in the view of their 
<A NAME="997"></A>whole country, and glorious to die in the arms of their mothers and wives, 
<A NAME="998"></A>falling as became Spartans. As for Chilonis, she retired with a halter 
<A NAME="999"></A>about her neck, resolving to die so rather than fall into the hands Cleonymus, 
<A NAME="1000"></A>if the city were taken.
<A NAME="1001"></A><BR><BR>Pyrrhus himself, in person, advanced with his foot to force through 
<A NAME="1002"></A>the shields of the Spartans ranged against him, and to get over the trench, 
<A NAME="1003"></A>which was scarce passable, because the looseness of the fresh earth afforded 
<A NAME="1004"></A>no firm footing for the soldiers. Ptolemy, his son, with two thousand Gauls, 
<A NAME="1005"></A>and some choice men of the Chaonians, went around the trench, and endeavoured 
<A NAME="1006"></A>to get over where the wagons were. But they, being so deep in the ground, 
<A NAME="1007"></A>and placed close together, not only made his passage, but also the defence 
<A NAME="1008"></A>of the Lacedaemonians, very troublesome. Yet now the Gauls had got the 
<A NAME="1009"></A>wheels out of the ground, and were drawing off the wagons toward the river, 
<A NAME="1010"></A>when young Acrotatus, seeing the danger, passing through the town with 
<A NAME="1011"></A>three hundred men, surrounded Ptolemy undiscerned, taking the advantage 
<A NAME="1012"></A>of some slopes of the ground, until he fell upon his rear, and forced him 
<A NAME="1013"></A>to wheel about. And thrusting one another into the ditch, and falling among 
<A NAME="1014"></A>the wagons, at last with much loss, not without difficulty, they withdrew. 
<A NAME="1015"></A>The elderly men and all the women saw this brave action of Acrotatus, and 
<A NAME="1016"></A>when be returned back into the town to his first post, all covered with 
<A NAME="1017"></A>blood and fierce and elate with victory, he seemed to the Spartan women 
<A NAME="1018"></A>to have become taller and more beautiful than before, and they envied Chilonis 
<A NAME="1019"></A>so worthy a lover. And some of the old men followed him, crying aloud, 
<A NAME="1020"></A>"Go on, Acrotatus, be happy with Chilonis, and beget brave sons for Sparta." 
<A NAME="1021"></A>Where Pyrrhus himself fought was the hottest of the action and many of 
<A NAME="1022"></A>the Spartans did gallantly, but in particular one Phyllius signalized himself, 
<A NAME="1023"></A>made the best resistance, and killed most assailants; and when he found 
<A NAME="1024"></A>himself ready to sink with the many wounds he had received, retiring a 
<A NAME="1025"></A>little out of his place behind another, he fell down among his fellow-soldiers, 
<A NAME="1026"></A>that the enemy might not carry off his body. The fight ended with the day, 
<A NAME="1027"></A>and Pyrrhus, in his sleep, dreamed that he drew thunderbolts upon Lacedaemon, 
<A NAME="1028"></A>and set it all on fire, and rejoiced at the sight; and waking, in this 
<A NAME="1029"></A>transport of joy, he commanded his officers to get all things ready for 
<A NAME="1030"></A>a second assault, and relating his dream among his friends, supposing it 
<A NAME="1031"></A>to mean that he should take the town by storm, the rest assented to it 
<A NAME="1032"></A>with admiration, but Lysimachus was not pleased with the dream, and told 
<A NAME="1033"></A>him he feared lest as places struck with lightning are held sacred, and 
<A NAME="1034"></A>not to be trodden upon, so the gods might by this let him know the city 
<A NAME="1035"></A>should not be taken. Pyrrhus replied, that all these things were but idle 
<A NAME="1036"></A>talk, full of uncertainty, and only fit to amuse the vulgar; their thought, 
<A NAME="1037"></A>with their swords in their hands, should always be-
<A NAME="1038"></A><BR><BR>"The one good omen is King Pyrrhus's cause," and so got up, and 
<A NAME="1039"></A>drew out his army to the walls by break of day. The Lacedaemonians, in 
<A NAME="1040"></A>resolution and courage, made a defence even beyond their power; the women 
<A NAME="1041"></A>were all by, helping them to arms, and bringing bread and drink to those 
<A NAME="1042"></A>that desired it, and taking care of the wounded. The Macedonians attempted 
<A NAME="1043"></A>to fill up the trench, bringing huge quantities of materials and throwing 
<A NAME="1044"></A>them upon the arms and dead bodies, that lay there and were covered over. 
<A NAME="1045"></A>While the Lacedaemonians opposed this with all their force, Pyrrhus, in 
<A NAME="1046"></A>person, appeared on their side of the trench and wagons, pressing on horseback 
<A NAME="1047"></A>toward the city, at which the men who had that post calling out, and the 
<A NAME="1048"></A>women shrieking and running about, while Pyrrhus violently pushed on, and 
<A NAME="1049"></A>beat down all that disputed his way, his horse received a shot in the belly 
<A NAME="1050"></A>from a Cretan arrow, and, in his convulsions as he died, threw off Pyrrhus 
<A NAME="1051"></A>on slippery and steep ground. And all about him being in confusion at this, 
<A NAME="1052"></A>the Spartans came boldly up, and making good use of their missiles, forced 
<A NAME="1053"></A>them off again. After this Pyrrhus, in other quarters also, put an end 
<A NAME="1054"></A>to the combat, imagining the Lacedaemonians would be inclined to yield, 
<A NAME="1055"></A>as almost all of them were wounded, and very great numbers killed outright; 
<A NAME="1056"></A>but the good fortune of the city, either satisfied with the experiment 
<A NAME="1057"></A>upon the bravery of the citizens, or willing to prove how much even in 
<A NAME="1058"></A>the last extremities such interposition may effect, brought, when the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="1059"></A>had now but very slender hopes left, Aminias, the Phocian, one of Antigonus's 
<A NAME="1060"></A>commanders, from Corinth to their assistance, with a force of mercenaries; 
<A NAME="1061"></A>and they were no sooner received into the town, but Areus, their king, 
<A NAME="1062"></A>arrived there himself, too, from Crete, with two thousand men more. The 
<A NAME="1063"></A>women upon this went all home to their houses, finding it no longer necessary 
<A NAME="1064"></A>for them to meddle with the business of the war; and they also were sent 
<A NAME="1065"></A>back, who, though not of military age, were by necessity forced to take 
<A NAME="1066"></A>arms, while the rest prepared to fight Pyrrhus.
<A NAME="1067"></A><BR><BR>He, upon the coming of these additional forces, was indeed possessed 
<A NAME="1068"></A>with a more eager desire and ambition than before to make himself master 
<A NAME="1069"></A>of the town; but his designs not succeeding, and receiving fresh losses 
<A NAME="1070"></A>every day, he gave over the siege, and fell to plundering the country, 
<A NAME="1071"></A>determining to winter thereabout. But fate is unavoidable, and a great 
<A NAME="1072"></A>feud happening at Argos between Aristeas and Aristippus, two principal 
<A NAME="1073"></A>citizens, after Aristippus had resolved to make use of the friendship of 
<A NAME="1074"></A>Antigonus, Aristeas to anticipate him invited Pyrrhus thither. And he always 
<A NAME="1075"></A>revolving hopes upon hopes, and treating all his successes as occasions 
<A NAME="1076"></A>of more, and his reverses as defects to be amended by new enterprises, 
<A NAME="1077"></A>allowed neither losses nor victo
