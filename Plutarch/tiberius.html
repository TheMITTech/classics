<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Having completed the first two narratives, we now may proceed to take a 
<A NAME="11"></A>view of misfortunes, not less remarkable, in the Roman couple, and with 
<A NAME="12"></A>the lives of Agis and Cleomenes, compare these of Tiberius and Caius. They 
<A NAME="13"></A>were the sons of Tiberius Gracchus, who though he had been once censor, 
<A NAME="14"></A>twice consul, and twice had triumphed, yet was more renowned and esteemed 
<A NAME="15"></A>for his virtue than his honours. Upon this account, after the death of 
<A NAME="16"></A>Scipio who overthrew Hannibal, he was thought worthy to match with his 
<A NAME="17"></A>daughter Cornelia, though there had been no friendship or familiarity between 
<A NAME="18"></A>Scipio and him, but rather the contrary. There is a story told that he 
<A NAME="19"></A>once found in his bed-chamber a couple of snakes, and that the soothsayers, 
<A NAME="20"></A>being consulted concerning the prodigy, advised that he should neither 
<A NAME="21"></A>kill them both nor let them both escape; adding, that if the male serpent 
<A NAME="22"></A>was killed, Tiberius should die, and if the female, Cornelia. And that 
<A NAME="23"></A>therefore Tiberius, who extremely loved his wife, and thought, besides, 
<A NAME="24"></A>that it was much more his part, who was an old man, to die, than it was 
<A NAME="25"></A>hers, who as yet was but a young woman, killed the male serpent, and let 
<A NAME="26"></A>the female escape; and soon after himself died, leaving behind him twelve 
<A NAME="27"></A>children borne to him by Cornelia.
<A NAME="28"></A><BR><BR>Cornelia, taking upon herself all the care of the household and 
<A NAME="29"></A>the education of her children, approved herself so discreet a matron, so 
<A NAME="30"></A>affectionate a mother, and so constant and noble-spirited a widow, that 
<A NAME="31"></A>Tiberius seemed to all men to have done nothing unreasonable in choosing 
<A NAME="32"></A>to die for such a woman; who, when King Ptolemy himself proffered her his 
<A NAME="33"></A>crown, and would have married her, refused it, and chose rather to live 
<A NAME="34"></A>a widow. In this state she continued, and lost all her children, except 
<A NAME="35"></A>one daughter, who was married to Scipio the younger, and two sons, Tiberius 
<A NAME="36"></A>and Caius, whose lives we are now writing.
<A NAME="37"></A><BR><BR>These she brought up with such care, that though they were without 
<A NAME="38"></A>dispute in natural endowments and dispositions the first among the Romans 
<A NAME="39"></A>of their time, yet they seemed to owe their virtues even more to their 
<A NAME="40"></A>education than to their birth. And as, in the statues and pictures made 
<A NAME="41"></A>of Castor and Pollux, though the brothers resemble one another, yet there 
<A NAME="42"></A>is a difference to be perceived in their countenances, between the one, 
<A NAME="43"></A>who delighted in the cestus, and the other, that was famous in the course, 
<A NAME="44"></A>so between these two noble youths, though there was a strong general likeness 
<A NAME="45"></A>in their common love of fortitude and temperance, in their liberality, 
<A NAME="46"></A>their eloquence, and their greatness of mind, yet in their actions and 
<A NAME="47"></A>administrations of public affairs, a considerable variation showed itself. 
<A NAME="48"></A>It will not be amiss before we proceed to mark the difference between 
<A NAME="49"></A>them.
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR>Tiberius, in the form and expression of his countenance, and in 
<A NAME="51"></A>his gesture and motion, was gentle and composed; but Caius, earnest and 
<A NAME="52"></A>vehement. And so in their public speeches to the people, the one spoke 
<A NAME="53"></A>in a quiet, orderly manner, standing throughout on the same spot; the other 
<A NAME="54"></A>would walk about on the hustings, and in the heat of his orations pull 
<A NAME="55"></A>his gown off his shoulders, and was the first of all the Romans that used 
<A NAME="56"></A>such gestures; as Cleon is said to have been the first orator among the 
<A NAME="57"></A>Athenians that pulled off his cloak and smote his thigh, when addressing 
<A NAME="58"></A>the people. Caius's oratory was impetuous and passionate, making everything 
<A NAME="59"></A>tell to the utmost, whereas Tiberius was gentle and persuasive, awakening 
<A NAME="60"></A>emotions of pity. His diction was pure and carefully correct, while that 
<A NAME="61"></A>of Caius was vehement and rich. So likewise in their way of living and 
<A NAME="62"></A>at their tables, Tiberius was frugal and plain, Caius, compared with other 
<A NAME="63"></A>men, temperate and even austere, but contrasting with his brother in a 
<A NAME="64"></A>fondness for new fashions and rarities, as appears in Drusus's charge against 
<A NAME="65"></A>him, that he had bought some silver dolphins, to the value of twelve hundred 
<A NAME="66"></A>and fifty drachmas for every pound weight.
<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR>The same difference that appeared in their diction was observable 
<A NAME="68"></A>also in their tempers. The one was mild and reasonable, the other rough 
<A NAME="69"></A>and passionate, and to that degree, that often, in the midst of speaking, 
<A NAME="70"></A>he was so hurried away by his passion against his judgment, that his voice 
<A NAME="71"></A>lost its tone, and he began to pass into mere abusive talking, spoiling 
<A NAME="72"></A>his whole speech. As a remedy to this excess, he made use of an ingenious 
<A NAME="73"></A>servant of his, one Licinius, who stood constantly behind him with a sort 
<A NAME="74"></A>of pitch-pipe, or instrument to regulate the voice by, and whenever he 
<A NAME="75"></A>perceived his master's tone alter and break with anger, he struck a soft 
<A NAME="76"></A>note with his pipe, on hearing which Caius immediately checked the vehemence 
<A NAME="77"></A>of his passion, and his voice, grew quieter, and allowed himself to be 
<A NAME="78"></A>recalled to temper. Such are the differences between the two brothers; 
<A NAME="79"></A>but their valour in war against their country's enemies, their justice 
<A NAME="80"></A>in the government of its subjects, their care and industry in office, and 
<A NAME="81"></A>their self-command in all that regarded their pleasures, were equally remarkable 
<A NAME="82"></A>in both.
<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR>Tiberius was the elder by nine years; owing to which their actions 
<A NAME="84"></A>as public men were divided by the difference of the times in which those 
<A NAME="85"></A>of the one and those of the other were performed. And one of the principal 
<A NAME="86"></A>causes of the failure of their enterprises was this interval between their 
<A NAME="87"></A>careers, and the want of combination of their efforts. The power they would 
<A NAME="88"></A>have exercised, had they flourished both together, could scarcely have 
<A NAME="89"></A>failed to overcome all resistance. We must therefore give an account of 
<A NAME="90"></A>each of them singly, and first of the eldest.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR>Tiberius, immediately on his attaining manhood, had such a reputation 
<A NAME="92"></A>that he was admitted into the college of the augurs, and that in consideration 
<A NAME="93"></A>more of his early virtue than of his noble birth. This appeared by what 
<A NAME="94"></A>Appius Claudius did, who, though he had been consul and censor, and was 
<A NAME="95"></A>now the head of the Roman senate, and had the highest sense of his own 
<A NAME="96"></A>place and merit, at a public feast of the augurs, addressed himself openly 
<A NAME="97"></A>to Tiberius, and with great expressions of kindness, offered him his daughter 
<A NAME="98"></A>in marriage. And when Tiberius gladly accepted, and the agreement had thus 
<A NAME="99"></A>been completed, Appius returning home, no sooner had reached his door, 
<A NAME="100"></A>but he called to his wife and cried out in a loud voice, "O Antistia, I 
<A NAME="101"></A>have contracted our daughter Claudia to a husband." She, being amazed, 
<A NAME="102"></A>answered, "But why so suddenly, or what means this haste? Unless you have 
<A NAME="103"></A>provided Tiberius Gracchus for her husband." I am not ignorant that some 
<A NAME="104"></A>apply this story to Tiberius, the father of the Gracchi, and Scipio Africanus; 
<A NAME="105"></A>but most relate it as we have done. And Polybius writes, that after the 
<A NAME="106"></A>death of Scipio Africanus, the nearest relations of Cornelia, preferring 
<A NAME="107"></A>Tiberius to all other competitors, gave her to him in marriage, not having 
<A NAME="108"></A>been engaged or promised to any one by her father.
<A NAME="109"></A><BR><BR>This young Tiberius, accordingly, serving in Africa under the younger 
<A NAME="110"></A>Scipio, who had married his sister, and living there under the same tent 
<A NAME="111"></A>with him, soon learned to estimate the noble spirit of his commander, which 
<A NAME="112"></A>was so fit to inspire strong feelings of emulation in virtue and desire 
<A NAME="113"></A>to prove merit in action, and in a short time he excelled all the young 
<A NAME="114"></A>men of the army in obedience and courage; and he was the first that mounted 
<A NAME="115"></A>the enemy's wall, as Fannius says, who writes that he himself climbed up 
<A NAME="116"></A>with him, and was partaker in the achievement. He was regarded, while he 
<A NAME="117"></A>continued with the army, with great affection; and left behind him on his 
<A NAME="118"></A>departure a strong desire for his return.
<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR>After that expedition, being chosen paymaster, it was his fortune 
<A NAME="120"></A>to serve in the war against the Numantines, under the command of Caius 
<A NAME="121"></A>Mancinus, the consul, a person of no bad character, but the most unfortunate 
<A NAME="122"></A>of all the Roman generals. Notwithstanding, amidst the greatest misfortunes, 
<A NAME="123"></A>and in the most unsuccessful enterprises, not only the discretion and valour 
<A NAME="124"></A>of Tiberius, but also, which was still more to be admired, the great respect 
<A NAME="125"></A>and honour which he showed for his general, were most eminently remarkable; 
<A NAME="126"></A>though the general himself, when reduced in straits, forgot his own dignity 
<A NAME="127"></A>and office. For being beaten in various great battles, he endeavoured to 
<A NAME="128"></A>dislodge by night and leave his camp; which the Numantines perceiving, 
<A NAME="129"></A>immediately possessed themselves of his camp, and pursuing that part of 
<A NAME="130"></A>the forces which was in flight, slew those that were in the rear, hedged 
<A NAME="131"></A>the whole army in on every side, and forced them into difficult ground, 
<A NAME="132"></A>whence there could be no possibility of an escape. Mancinus, despairing 
<A NAME="133"></A>to make his way through by force, sent a messenger to desire a truce and 
<A NAME="134"></A>conditions of peace. But they refused to give their confidence to any one 
<A NAME="135"></A>except Tiberius, and required that he should be sent to treat with them. 
<A NAME="136"></A>This was not only in regard to the young man's own character, for he had 
<A NAME="137"></A>a great reputation amongst the soldiers, but also in remembrance of his 
<A NAME="138"></A>father Tiberius, who, in his command against the Spaniards, had reduced 
<A NAME="139"></A>great numbers of them to subjection, but granted a peace to the Numantines, 
<A NAME="140"></A>and prevailed upon the Romans to keep it punctually and 
<A NAME="141"></A>inviolably.
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR>Tiberius was accordingly despatched to the enemy, whom he persuaded 
<A NAME="143"></A>to accept of several conditions, and he himself complied with others; and 
<A NAME="144"></A>by this means, it is beyond a question, that he saved twenty thousand of 
<A NAME="145"></A>the Roman citizens, besides attendants and camp followers. However, the 
<A NAME="146"></A>Numantines retained possession of all the property they had found and plundered 
<A NAME="147"></A>in the encampment; and amongst other things were Tiberius's books of accounts, 
<A NAME="148"></A>containing the whole transactions of his quaestorship, which he was extremely 
<A NAME="149"></A>anxious to recover. And therefore, when the army were already upon their 
<A NAME="150"></A>march, he returned to Numantia, accompanied with only three or four of 
<A NAME="151"></A>his friends; and making his application to the officers of the Numantines, 
<A NAME="152"></A>he entreated that they would return him his books, lest his enemies should 
<A NAME="153"></A>have it in their power to reproach him with not being able to give an account 
<A NAME="154"></A>of the moneys intrusted to him. The Numantines joyfully embraced this opportunity 
<A NAME="155"></A>of obliging him, and invited him into the city; as he stood hesitating, 
<A NAME="156"></A>they came up and took him by the hands, and begged that he would no longer 
<A NAME="157"></A>look upon them as enemies, but believe them to be his friends, and treat 
<A NAME="158"></A>them as such. Tiberius thought it well to consent, desirous as he was to 
<A NAME="159"></A>have his books returned, and was afraid lest he should disoblige them by 
<A NAME="160"></A>showing any distrust. As soon as he entered into the city, they first offered 
<A NAME="161"></A>him food, and made every kind of entreaty that he would sit down and eat 
<A NAME="162"></A>something in their company. Afterwards they returned his books, and gave 
<A NAME="163"></A>him the liberty to take whatever he wished for in the remaining spoils. 
<A NAME="164"></A>He, on the other hand, would accept of nothing but some frankincense, which 
<A NAME="165"></A>he used in his public sacrifices, and bidding them farewell with every 
<A NAME="166"></A>expression of kindness, departed.
<A NAME="167"></A><BR><BR>When he returned to Rome, he found the whole transaction censured 
<A NAME="168"></A>and reproached, as a proceeding that was base and scandalous to the Romans. 
<A NAME="169"></A>But the relations and friends of the soldiers, forming a large body among 
<A NAME="170"></A>the people, came flocking to Tiberius, whom they acknowledged as the preserver 
<A NAME="171"></A>of so many citizens, imputing to the general all the miscarriages which 
<A NAME="172"></A>had happened. Those who cried out against what had been done, urged for 
<A NAME="173"></A>imitation the example of their ancestors, who stripped and handed over 
<A NAME="174"></A>to the Samnites not only the generals who had consented to the terms of 
<A NAME="175"></A>release, but also all the quaestors, for example, and tribunes, who had 
<A NAME="176"></A>in any way implicated themselves in the agreement, laying the guilt of 
<A NAME="177"></A>perjury and breach of conditions on their heads. But, in this all the populace, 
<A NAME="178"></A>showing an extraordinary kindness and affection for Tiberius, indeed voted 
<A NAME="179"></A>that the consul should be stripped and put in irons, and so delivered to 
<A NAME="180"></A>the Numantines; but, for the sake of Tiberius, spared all the other officers. 
<A NAME="181"></A>It may be probable, also, that Scipio, who at that time was the greatest 
<A NAME="182"></A>and most powerful man among the Romans, contributed to save him, though 
<A NAME="183"></A>indeed he was also censured for not protecting Mancinus too, and that he 
<A NAME="184"></A>did not exert himself to maintain the observance of the articles of peace 
<A NAME="185"></A>which had been agreed upon by his kinsman and friend Tiberius. But it may 
<A NAME="186"></A>be presumed that the difference between them was for the most part due 
<A NAME="187"></A>to ambitious feelings, and to the friends and reasoners who urged on Tiberius, 
<A NAME="188"></A>and, as it was, it never amounted to anything that might not have been 
<A NAME="189"></A>remedied, or that was really bad. Nor can I think that Tiberius would ever 
<A NAME="190"></A>have met with his misfortunes, if Scipio had been concerned in dealing 
<A NAME="191"></A>with his measures; but he was away fighting at Numantia when Tiberius, 
<A NAME="192"></A>upon the following occasion, first came forward as a 
<A NAME="193"></A>legislator.
<A NAME="194"></A><BR><BR>Of the land which the Romans gained by conquest from their neighbours, 
<A NAME="195"></A>part they sold publicly, and turned the remainder into common; this common 
<A NAME="196"></A>land they assigned to such of the citizens as were poor and indigent, for 
<A NAME="197"></A>which they were to pay only a small acknowledgment into the public treasury. 
<A NAME="198"></A>But when the wealthy men began to offer larger rents, and drive the poorer 
<A NAME="199"></A>people out, it was enacted by law that no person whatever should enjoy 
<A NAME="200"></A>more than five hundred acres of ground. This act for some time checked 
<A NAME="201"></A>the avarice of the richer, and was of great assistance to the poorer people, 
<A NAME="202"></A>who retained under it their respective proportions of ground, as they had 
<A NAME="203"></A>been formerly rented by them. Afterwards the rich men of the neighbourhood 
<A NAME="204"></A>contrived to get these lands again into their possession, under other people's 
<A NAME="205"></A>names, and at last would not stick to claim most of them publicly in their 
<A NAME="206"></A>own. The poor, who were thus deprived of their farms, were no longer either 
<A NAME="207"></A>ready, as they had formerly been, to serve in war or careful in the education 
<A NAME="208"></A>of their children; insomuch that in a short time there were comparatively 
<A NAME="209"></A>few freemen remaining in all Italy, which swarmed with workhouses full 
<A NAME="210"></A>of foreign-born slaves. These the rich men employed in cultivating their 
<A NAME="211"></A>ground of which they dispossessed the citizens. Caius Laelius, the intimate 
<A NAME="212"></A>friend of Scipio, undertook to reform this abuse; but meeting with opposition 
<A NAME="213"></A>from men of authority, and fearing a disturbance, he soon desisted, and 
<A NAME="214"></A>received the name of the Wise or the Prudent, both which meanings belong 
<A NAME="215"></A>to the Latin word Sapiens.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR><BR>But Tiberius, being elected tribune of the people, entered upon 
<A NAME="217"></A>that design without delay, at the instigation, as is most commonly stated, 
<A NAME="218"></A>of Diophanes, the rhetorician, and Blossius, the philosopher. Diophanes 
<A NAME="219"></A>was a refugee from Mitylene, the other was an Italian, of the city of Cuma, 
<A NAME="220"></A>and was educated there under Antipater of Tarsus, who afterwards did him 
<A NAME="221"></A>the honour to dedicate some of his philosophical lectures to 
<A NAME="222"></A>him.
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR>Some have also charged Cornelia, the mother of Tiberius, with contributing 
<A NAME="224"></A>towards it, because she frequently upbraided her sons, that the Romans 
<A NAME="225"></A>as yet rather called her the daughter of Scipio, than the mother of the 
<A NAME="226"></A>Gracchi. Others again say that Spurius Postumius was the chief occasion. 
<A NAME="227"></A>He was a man of the same age with Tiberius, and his rival for reputation 
<A NAME="228"></A>as a public speaker; and when Tiberius, at his return from the campaign, 
<A NAME="229"></A>found him to have got far beyond him in fame and influence, and to be much 
<A NAME="230"></A>looked up to, he thought to outdo him, by attempting a popular enterprise 
<A NAME="231"></A>of this difficulty and of such great consequence. But his brother Caius 
<A NAME="232"></A>has left it us in writing, that when Tiberius went through Tuscany to Numantia, 
<A NAME="233"></A>and found the country almost depopulated, there being hardly any free husbandmen 
<A NAME="234"></A>or shepherds, but for the most part only barbarian, imported slaves, he 
<A NAME="235"></A>then first conceived the course of policy which in the sequel proved so 
<A NAME="236"></A>fatal to his family. Though it is also most certain that the people themselves 
<A NAME="237"></A>chiefly excited his zeal and determination in the prosecution of it, by 
<A NAME="238"></A>setting up writings upon the porches, walls, and monuments, calling upon 
<A NAME="239"></A>him to reinstate the poor citizens in their former possessions.
<A NAME="240"></A><BR><BR>However, he did not draw up his law without the advice and assistance 
<A NAME="241"></A>of those citizens that were then most eminent for their virtue and authority; 
<A NAME="242"></A>amongst whom were Crassus, the high-priest, Mucius Scaevola, the lawyer, 
<A NAME="243"></A>who at that time was consul, and Claudius Appius, his father-in-law. Never 
<A NAME="244"></A>did any law appear more moderate and gentle, especially being enacted against 
<A NAME="245"></A>such great oppression and avarice. For they who ought to have been severely 
<A NAME="246"></A>punished for trangressing the former laws, and should at least have lost 
<A NAME="247"></A>all their titles to such lands which they had unjustly usurped, were notwithstanding 
<A NAME="248"></A>to receive a price for quitting their unlawful claims, and giving up their 
<A NAME="249"></A>lands to those fit owners who stood in need of help. But though this reformation 
<A NAME="250"></A>was managed with so much tenderness that, all the former transactions being 
<A NAME="251"></A>passed over, the people were only thankful to prevent abuses of the like 
<A NAME="252"></A>nature for the future, yet, on the other hand, the moneyed men, and those 
<A NAME="253"></A>of great estates, were exasperated, through their covetous feelings against 
<A NAME="254"></A>the law itself, and against the lawgiver, through anger and party-spirit. 
<A NAME="255"></A>They therefore endeavoured to seduce the people, declaring that Tiberius 
<A NAME="256"></A>was designing a general redivision of lands, to overthrow the government, 
<A NAME="257"></A>and cut all things into confusion.
<A NAME="258"></A><BR><BR>But they had no success. For Tiberius, maintaining an honourable 
<A NAME="259"></A>and just cause, and possessed of eloquence sufficient to have made a less 
<A NAME="260"></A>creditable action appear plausible, was no safe or easy antagonist, when, 
<A NAME="261"></A>with the people crowding around the hustings, he took his place, and spoke 
<A NAME="262"></A>in behalf of the poor. "The savage beasts," said he, "in Italy, have their 
<A NAME="263"></A>particular dens, they have their places of repose and refuge; but the men 
<A NAME="264"></A>who bear arms, and expose their lives for the safety of their country, 
<A NAME="265"></A>enjoy in the meantime nothing more in it but the air and light and, having 
<A NAME="266"></A>no houses or settlements of their own, are constrained to wander from place 
<A NAME="267"></A>to place with their wives and children." He told them that the commanders 
<A NAME="268"></A>were guilty of a ridiculous error, when, at the head of their armies, they 
<A NAME="269"></A>exhorted the common soldiers to fight for their sepulchres and altars; 
<A NAME="270"></A>when not any amongst so many Romans is possessed of either altar or monument, 
<A NAME="271"></A>neither have they any houses of their own, or hearths of their ancestors 
<A NAME="272"></A>to defend. They fought indeed and were slain, but it was to maintain the 
<A NAME="273"></A>luxury and the wealth of other men. They were styled the masters of the 
<A NAME="274"></A>world, but in the meantime had not one foot of ground which they could 
<A NAME="275"></A>call their own. An harangue of this nature, spoken to an enthusiastic and 
<A NAME="276"></A>sympathizing audience, by a person of commanding spirit and genuine feelings, 
<A NAME="277"></A>no adversaries at that time were competent to oppose. Forbearing, therefore, 
<A NAME="278"></A>all discussion and debate, they addressed themselves to Marcus Octavius, 
<A NAME="279"></A>his fellow-tribune, who being a young man of a steady, orderly character, 
<A NAME="280"></A>and an intimate friend of Tiberius, upon this account declined at first 
<A NAME="281"></A>the task of opposing him; but at length, over-persuaded with the repeated 
<A NAME="282"></A>importunities of numerous considerable persons, he was prevailed upon to 
<A NAME="283"></A>do so, and hindered the passing of the law; it being the rule that any 
<A NAME="284"></A>tribune has a power to hinder an act, and that all the rest can effect 
<A NAME="285"></A>nothing, if only one of them dissents. Tiberius, irritated at these proceedings, 
<A NAME="286"></A>presently laid aside this milder bill, but at the same time preferred another; 
<A NAME="287"></A>which, as it was more grateful to the common people, so it was much more 
<A NAME="288"></A>severe against the wrongdoers, commanding them to make an immediate surrender 
<A NAME="289"></A>of all lands which, contrary to former laws, had come into their possession. 
<A NAME="290"></A>Hence there arose daily contentions between him and Octavius in their orations. 
<A NAME="291"></A>However, though they expressed themselves with the utmost heat and determination, 
<A NAME="292"></A>they yet were never known to descend to any personal reproaches, or in 
<A NAME="293"></A>their passion to let slip any indecent expressions, so as to derogate from 
<A NAME="294"></A>one another.
<A NAME="295"></A><BR><BR>For not alone-
<A NAME="296"></A><BR><BR>"In revellings and Bacchic play," but also in contentions and political 
<A NAME="297"></A>animosities, a noble nature and a temperate education stay and compose 
<A NAME="298"></A>the mind. Observing that Octavius himself was an offender against this 
<A NAME="299"></A>law, and detained a great quantity of ground from the commonalty, Tiberius 
<A NAME="300"></A>desired him to forbear opposing him any further, and proffered, for the 
<A NAME="301"></A>public good, though he himself had but an indifferent estate, to pay a 
<A NAME="302"></A>price for Octavius's share at his own cost and charges. But upon the refusal 
<A NAME="303"></A>of this proffer by Octavius, he then interposed an edict, prohibiting all 
<A NAME="304"></A>magistrates to exercise their respective functions, till such time as the 
<A NAME="305"></A>law was either ratified or rejected by public votes. He further sealed 
<A NAME="306"></A>up the gates of Saturn's temple, so that the treasurers could neither take 
<A NAME="307"></A>any money out from thence, nor put any in. He threatened to impose a severe 
<A NAME="308"></A>fine upon those of the praetors who presumed to disobey his commands, insomuch 
<A NAME="309"></A>that all the officers, for fear of this penalty, intermitted the exercise 
<A NAME="310"></A>of their several jurisdictions. Upon this the rich proprietors put themselves 
<A NAME="311"></A>into mourning, and went up and down melancholy and dejected; they entered 
<A NAME="312"></A>also into a conspiracy against Tiberius, and procured men to murder him; 
<A NAME="313"></A>so that he also, with all men's knowledge, whenever he went abroad, took 
<A NAME="314"></A>with him a sword-staff, such as robbers use, called in Latin a 
<A NAME="315"></A>dolo.
<A NAME="316"></A><BR><BR>When the day appointed was come, and the people summoned to give 
<A NAME="317"></A>their votes, the rich men seized upon the voting urns and carried them 
<A NAME="318"></A>away by force; thus all things were in confusion. But when Tiberius's party 
<A NAME="319"></A>appeared strong enough to oppose the contrary faction, and drew together 
<A NAME="320"></A>in a body, with the resolution to do so, Manlius and Fulvius, two of the 
<A NAME="321"></A>consular quality, threw themselves before Tiberius, took him by the hand, 
<A NAME="322"></A>and, with tears in their eyes, begged of him to desist. Tiberius, considering 
<A NAME="323"></A>the mischiefs that were all but now occurring, and having a great respect 
<A NAME="324"></A>for two such eminent persons, demanded of them what they would advise him 
<A NAME="325"></A>to do. They acknowledged themselves unfit to advise in a matter of so great 
<A NAME="326"></A>importance, but earnestly entreated him to leave it to the determination 
<A NAME="327"></A>of the senate. But when the senate assembled, and could not bring the business 
<A NAME="328"></A>to any result, through the prevalence of the rich faction, he then was 
<A NAME="329"></A>driven to a course neither legal nor fair, and proposed to deprive Octavius 
<A NAME="330"></A>of his tribuneship, it being impossible for him in any other way to get 
<A NAME="331"></A>the law brought to the vote. At first he addressed him publicly, with entreaties 
<A NAME="332"></A>couched in the kindest terms, and taking him by his hands, besought him, 
<A NAME="333"></A>that now, in the presence of all the people, he would take this opportunity 
<A NAME="334"></A>to oblige them, in granting only that request which was in itself so just 
<A NAME="335"></A>and reasonable, being but a small recompense in regard of those many dangers 
<A NAME="336"></A>and hardships which they had undergone for the public safety. Octavius, 
<A NAME="337"></A>however, would by no means be persuaded to compliance; upon which Tiberius 
<A NAME="338"></A>declared openly, that, seeing they two were united in the same office, 
<A NAME="339"></A>and of equal authority, it would be a difficult matter to compose their 
<A NAME="340"></A>difference on so weighty a matter without a civil war; and that the only 
<A NAME="341"></A>remedy which he knew must be the deposing one of them from their office. 
<A NAME="342"></A>He desired, therefore, that Octavius would summon the people to pass their 
<A NAME="343"></A>verdict upon him first, averring that he would willingly relinquish his 
<A NAME="344"></A>authority if the citizens desired it. Octavius refused; and Tiberius then 
<A NAME="345"></A>said he would himself put to the people the question of Octavius's deposition, 
<A NAME="346"></A>if upon mature deliberation he did not alter his mind and after this declaration 
<A NAME="347"></A>he adjourned the assembly till the next day.
<A NAME="348"></A><BR><BR>When the people were met together again, Tiberius placed himself 
<A NAME="349"></A>in the rostra, and endeavoured a second time to persuade Octavius. But 
<A NAME="350"></A>all being to no purpose, he referred the whole matter to the people, calling 
<A NAME="351"></A>on them to vote at once, whether Octavius should be deposed or not; and 
<A NAME="352"></A>when seventeen of the thirty-five tribes had already voted against him, 
<A NAME="353"></A>and there wanted only the votes of one tribe more for his final deprivation, 
<A NAME="354"></A>Tiberius put a short stop to the proceedings, and once more renewed his 
<A NAME="355"></A>importunities; he embraced and kissed him before all the assembly, begging 
<A NAME="356"></A>with all the earnestness imaginable, that he would neither suffer himself 
<A NAME="357"></A>to incur the dishonour, nor him to be reputed the author and promoter of 
<A NAME="358"></A>so odious a measure. Octavius, we are told, did seem a little softened 
<A NAME="359"></A>and moved with these entreaties; his eyes filled with tears, and he continued 
<A NAME="360"></A>silent for a considerable time. But presently looking towards the rich 
<A NAME="361"></A>men and proprietors of estates, who stood gathered in a body together, 
<A NAME="362"></A>partly for shame, and partly for fear of disgracing himself with them, 
<A NAME="363"></A>he boldly bade Tiberius use any severity he pleased. The law for his deprivation 
<A NAME="364"></A>being thus voted, Tiberius ordered one of his servants, whom he had made 
<A NAME="365"></A>a freeman, to remove Octavius from the rostra, employing his own domestic 
<A NAME="366"></A>freed servants in the stead of the public officers. And it made the action 
<A NAME="367"></A>seem all the sadder, that Octavius was dragged out in such an ignominious 
<A NAME="368"></A>manner. The people immediately assaulted him, whilst the rich men ran in 
<A NAME="369"></A>to his assistance. Octavius, with some difficulty, was snatched away and 
<A NAME="370"></A>safely conveyed out of the crowd; though a trusty servant of his, who had 
<A NAME="371"></A>placed himself in front of his master that he might assist his escape, 
<A NAME="372"></A>in keeping off the multitude, had his eyes struck out, much to the displeasure 
<A NAME="373"></A>of Tiberius, who ran with all haste, when he perceived the disturbance, 
<A NAME="374"></A>to appease the rioters.
<A NAME="375"></A><BR><BR>This being done, the law concerning the lands was ratified and 
<A NAME="376"></A>confirmed, and three commissioners were appointed, to make a survey of 
<A NAME="377"></A>the grounds, and see the same equally divided. These were Tiberius himself, 
<A NAME="378"></A>Claudius Appius, his father-in-law and his brother, Caius Gracchus, who 
<A NAME="379"></A>at this time was not at Rome, but in the army under the command of Scipio 
<A NAME="380"></A>Africanus before Numantia. These things were transacted by Tiberius without 
<A NAME="381"></A>any disturbance, none daring to offer any resistance to him; besides which, 
<A NAME="382"></A>he gave the appointment as tribune in Octavius's place, not to any person 
<A NAME="383"></A>of distinction, but to a certain Mucius, one of his own clients. The great 
<A NAME="384"></A>men of the city were therefore utterly offended, and, fearing lest he grew 
<A NAME="385"></A>yet more popular, they took all opportunities of affronting him publicly 
<A NAME="386"></A>in the senate-house. For when he requested, as was usual, to have a tent 
<A NAME="387"></A>provided at the public charge for his use, while dividing the lands, though 
<A NAME="388"></A>it was a favour commonly granted to persons employed in business of much 
<A NAME="389"></A>less importance, it was peremptorily refused to him; and the allowance 
<A NAME="390"></A>made him for his daily expenses was fixed to nine obols only. The chief 
<A NAME="391"></A>promoter of these affronts was Publius Nasica, who openly abandoned himself 
<A NAME="392"></A>to his feelings of hatred against Tiberius, being a large holder of the 
<A NAME="393"></A>public lands, and not a little resenting now to be turned out of them by 
<A NAME="394"></A>force. The people, on the other hand, were still more and more excited, 
<A NAME="395"></A>insomuch that a little after this, it happening that one of Tiberius's 
<A NAME="396"></A>friends died suddenly, and his body being marked with malignant-looking 
<A NAME="397"></A>spots, they ran, in a tumultuous manner, to his funeral, crying aloud that 
<A NAME="398"></A>the man was poisoned. They took the bier upon their shoulders, and stood 
<A NAME="399"></A>over it, while it was placed on the pile, and really seemed to have fair 
<A NAME="400"></A>grounds for their suspicion of foul play. For the body burst open, and 
<A NAME="401"></A>such a quantity of corrupt humours issued out, that the funeral fire was 
<A NAME="402"></A>extinguished, and when it was again kindled, the wood still would not burn; 
<A NAME="403"></A>insomuch that they were constrained to carry the corpse to another place, 
<A NAME="404"></A>where with much difficulty it took fire. Besides this, Tiberius, that he 
<A NAME="405"></A>might incense the people yet more, put himself into mourning, brought his 
<A NAME="406"></A>children amongst the crowd, and entreated the people to provide for them 
<A NAME="407"></A>and their mother, as if he now despaired of his own 
<A NAME="408"></A>security.
<A NAME="409"></A><BR><BR>About this time king Attalus, surnamed Philometor, died, and Eudemus, 
<A NAME="410"></A>a Pergamenian, brought his last will to Rome, by which he had made the 
<A NAME="411"></A>Roman people his heirs. Tiberius, to please the people, immediately proposed 
<A NAME="412"></A>making a law, that all the money which Attalus left should be distributed 
<A NAME="413"></A>amongst such poor citizens as were to be sharers of the public lands, for 
<A NAME="414"></A>the better enabling them to proceed in stocking and cultivating their ground; 
<A NAME="415"></A>and as for the cities that were in the territories of Attalus, he declared 
<A NAME="416"></A>that the disposal of them did not at all belong to the senate, but to the 
<A NAME="417"></A>people, and that he himself would ask their pleasure herein. By this he 
<A NAME="418"></A>offended the senate more than ever he had done before, and Pompeius stood 
<A NAME="419"></A>up and acquainted them that he was the next neighbour to Tiberius, and 
<A NAME="420"></A>so had the opportunity of knowing that Eudemus, the Pergamenian, had presented 
<A NAME="421"></A>Tiberius with a royal diadem and a purple robe, as before long he was to 
<A NAME="422"></A>be king of Rome. Quintus Metellus also upbraided him, saying, that when 
<A NAME="423"></A>his father was censor, the Romans, whenever he happened to be going home 
<A NAME="424"></A>from a supper, used to put out all their lights, lest they should be seen 
<A NAME="425"></A>to have indulged themselves in feasting and drinking at unseasonable hours, 
<A NAME="426"></A>whereas now the most indigent and audacious of the people were found with 
<A NAME="427"></A>their torches at night, following Tiberius home. Titus Annius, a man of 
<A NAME="428"></A>no great repute for either justice or temperance, but famous for his skill 
<A NAME="429"></A>in putting and answering questions, challenged Tiberius to the proof by 
<A NAME="430"></A>wager, declaring him to have deposed a magistrate who by law was sacred 
<A NAME="431"></A>and inviolable. Loud clamour ensued, and Tiberius, quitting the senate 
<A NAME="432"></A>hastily, called together the people, and summoning Annius to appear, was 
<A NAME="433"></A>proceeding to accuse him. But Annius, being no great speaker, nor of any 
<A NAME="434"></A>repute compared to him, sheltered himself in his own particular art, and 
<A NAME="435"></A>desired that he might propose one or two questions to Tiberius before he 
<A NAME="436"></A>entered upon the chief argument. This liberty being granted, and silence 
<A NAME="437"></A>proclaimed, Annius proposed his question. "If you," said he, "had a design 
<A NAME="438"></A>to disgrace and defame me, and I should apply myself to one of your colleagues 
<A NAME="439"></A>for redress, and he should come forward to my assistance, would you for 
<A NAME="440"></A>that reason fall into a passion, and depose him?" Tiberius, they say, was 
<A NAME="441"></A>so much disconcerted at this question, that, though at other times his 
<A NAME="442"></A>assurance as his readiness of speech was always remarkable, yet now he 
<A NAME="443"></A>was silent and made no reply.
<A NAME="444"></A><BR><BR>For the present he dismissed the assembly. But beginning to understand 
<A NAME="445"></A>that the course he had taken with Octavius had created offence even among 
<A NAME="446"></A>the populace as well as the nobility, because the dignity of the tribunes 
<A NAME="447"></A>seemed to be violated, which had always continued till that day sacred 
<A NAME="448"></A>and honourable, he made a speech to the people in justification of himself; 
<A NAME="449"></A>out of which it may not be improper to collect some particulars, to give 
<A NAME="450"></A>an impression of his force and persuasiveness in speaking. "A tribune," 
<A NAME="451"></A>he said, "of the people, is sacred indeed, and ought to be inviolable, 
<A NAME="452"></A>because in a manner consecrated to be the guardian and protector of them; 
<A NAME="453"></A>but if he degenerate so far as to oppress the people, abridge their powers, 
<A NAME="454"></A>and take away their liberty of voting, he stands deprived by his own act 
<A NAME="455"></A>of honours and immunities, by the neglect of the duty for which the honour 
<A NAME="456"></A>was bestowed upon him. Otherwise we should be under the obligation to let 
<A NAME="457"></A>a tribune do this pleasure, though he should proceed to destroy the capitol 
<A NAME="458"></A>or set fire to the arsenal. He who should make these attempts would be 
<A NAME="459"></A>a bad tribune. He who assails the power of the people is no longer a tribune 
<A NAME="460"></A>at all. Is it not inconceivable that a tribune should have power to imprison 
<A NAME="461"></A>a consul, and the people have no authority to degrade him when he uses 
<A NAME="462"></A>that honour which he received from them, to their detriment? For the tribunes, 
<A NAME="463"></A>as well as the consuls, hold office by the people's votes. The kingly government, 
<A NAME="464"></A>which comprehends all sorts of authority in itself alone, is moreover elevated 
<A NAME="465"></A>by the greatest and most religious solemnity imaginable into a condition 
<A NAME="466"></A>of sanctity. But the citizens, notwithstanding this, deposed Tarquin, when 
<A NAME="467"></A>he acted wrongfully; and for the crime of one single man, the ancient government 
<A NAME="468"></A>under which Rome was built was abolished for ever. What is there in all 
<A NAME="469"></A>Rome so sacred and venerable as the vestal virgins, to whose care alone 
<A NAME="470"></A>the preservation of the eternal fire is committed? yet if one of these 
<A NAME="471"></A>transgress she is buried alive; the sanctity which for the gods' sakes 
<A NAME="472"></A>is allowed them, is forfeited when they offend against the gods. So likewise 
<A NAME="473"></A>a tribune retains not his inviolability, which for the people's sake was 
<A NAME="474"></A>accorded to him, when he offends against the people, and attacks the foundations 
<A NAME="475"></A>of that authority from whence he derived his own. We esteem him to be legally 
<A NAME="476"></A>chosen tribune who is elected only by the majority of votes; and is not 
<A NAME="477"></A>therefore the same person much more lawfully degraded when, by a general 
<A NAME="478"></A>consent of them all, they agreed to depose him? Nothing is so sacred as 
<A NAME="479"></A>religious offerings; yet the people were never prohibited to make use of 
<A NAME="480"></A>them, but suffered to remove and carry them wherever they pleased; so likewise, 
<A NAME="481"></A>as it were some sacred present, they have lawful power to transfer the 
<A NAME="482"></A>tribuneship from one man's hands to another's. Nor can that authority be 
<A NAME="483"></A>thought inviolable and irremovable which many of those who have held it, 
<A NAME="484"></A>have of their own act surrendered and desired to be discharged 
<A NAME="485"></A>from."
<A NAME="486"></A><BR><BR>These were the principal heads of Tiberius's apology. But his friends, 
<A NAME="487"></A>apprehending the dangers which seemed to threaten him, and the conspiracy 
<A NAME="488"></A>that was gathering head against him, were of opinion that the safest way 
<A NAME="489"></A>would be for him to petition that he might be continued tribune for the 
<A NAME="490"></A>year ensuing. Upon this consideration he again endeavoured to secure the 
<A NAME="491"></A>people's good-will with fresh laws, making the years of serving in the 
<A NAME="492"></A>war fewer than formerly, granting liberty of appeal from the judges to 
<A NAME="493"></A>the people, and joining to the senators, who were judges at that time, 
<A NAME="494"></A>an equal number of citizens of the horsemen's degree, endeavouring as much 
<A NAME="495"></A>as in him lay to lessen the power of the senate, rather from passion and 
<A NAME="496"></A>partisanship than from any rational regard to equity and the public good. 
<A NAME="497"></A>And when it came to the question whether these laws should be passed, and 
<A NAME="498"></A>they perceived that the opposite party were strongest, the people as yet 
<A NAME="499"></A>being not got together in a full body, they began first of all to gain 
<A NAME="500"></A>time by speeches in accusation of some of their fellow-magistrates and 
<A NAME="501"></A>at length adjourned the assembly till the day following.
<A NAME="502"></A><BR><BR>Tiberius then went down into the market-place amongst the people, 
<A NAME="503"></A>and made his addresses to them humbly and with tears in his eyes; and told 
<A NAME="504"></A>them he had just reason to suspect that his adversaries would attempt in 
<A NAME="505"></A>the night-time to break open his house and murder him. This worked so strongly 
<A NAME="506"></A>with the multitude, that several of them pitched tents round about his 
<A NAME="507"></A>house, and kept guard all night for the security of his person. By break 
<A NAME="508"></A>of day came one of the soothsayers, who prognosticate good or bad success 
<A NAME="509"></A>by the pecking of fowls, and threw them something to eat. The soothsayer 
<A NAME="510"></A>used his utmost endeavours to fright the fowls out of their coop; but none 
<A NAME="511"></A>of them except one would venture out, which fluttered with his left wing, 
<A NAME="512"></A>and stretched out its leg, and ran back again into the coop, without eating 
<A NAME="513"></A>anything. This put Tiberius in mind of another ill-omen which had formerly 
<A NAME="514"></A>happened to him. He had a very costly headpiece, which he made use of when 
<A NAME="515"></A>he engaged in any battle, and into this piece of armour two serpents crawled, 
<A NAME="516"></A>laid eggs, and brought forth young ones. The remembrance of which made 
<A NAME="517"></A>Tiberius more concerned now than otherwise he would have been. However, 
<A NAME="518"></A>he went towards the capitol as soon as he understood that the people were 
<A NAME="519"></A>assembled there; but before he got out of the house he stumbled upon the 
<A NAME="520"></A>threshold with such violence, that he broke the nail of his great toe, 
<A NAME="521"></A>insomuch that blood gushed out of his shoes. He was not gone very far before 
<A NAME="522"></A>he saw two ravens fighting on the top of a house which stood on his left 
<A NAME="523"></A>hand as he passed along; and though he was surrounded with a number of 
<A NAME="524"></A>people, a stone struck from its place by one of the ravens, fell just at 
<A NAME="525"></A>his foot. This even the boldest men about him felt as a check. But Blossius 
<A NAME="526"></A>of Cuma, who was present, told him that it would be a shame and an ignominious 
<A NAME="527"></A>thing for Tiberius, who was a son of Gracchus, the grandson of Scipio Africanus, 
<A NAME="528"></A>and the protector of the Roman people to refuse, for fear of a silly bird, 
<A NAME="529"></A>to answer when his countrymen called to him; and that his adversaries would 
<A NAME="530"></A>represent it not as a mere matter for their ridicule, but would declaim 
<A NAME="531"></A>about it to the people as the mark of a tyrannical temper, which felt a 
<A NAME="532"></A>pride in taking liberties with the people. At the same time several messengers 
<A NAME="533"></A>came also from his friends, to desire his presence at the capitol, saying 
<A NAME="534"></A>that all things went there according to expectation. And indeed Tiberius's 
<A NAME="535"></A>first entrance there was in every way successful; as soon as ever he appeared, 
<A NAME="536"></A>the people welcomed him with loud acclamations, and as he went up to his 
<A NAME="537"></A>place, they repeated their expressions of joy, and gathered in a body around 
<A NAME="538"></A>him, so that no one who was not well known to be his friend might approach. 
<A NAME="539"></A>Mucius then began to put the business again to the vote; but nothing could 
<A NAME="540"></A>be performed in the usual course and order, because of the disturbance 
<A NAME="541"></A>caused by those who were on the outside of the crowd, where there was a 
<A NAME="542"></A>struggle going on with those of the opposite party, who were pushing on 
<A NAME="543"></A>and trying to force their way in and establish themselves among 
<A NAME="544"></A>them.
<A NAME="545"></A><BR><BR>Whilst things were in this confusion, Flavius Flaccus, a senator, 
<A NAME="546"></A>standing in a place where he could be seen, but at such a distance from 
<A NAME="547"></A>Tiberius that he could not make him hear, signified to him by motions of 
<A NAME="548"></A>his hand, that he wished to impart something of consequence to him in private. 
<A NAME="549"></A>Tiberius ordered the multitude to make way for him, by which means, though 
<A NAME="550"></A>not without some difficulty, Flavius got to him, and informed him that 
<A NAME="551"></A>the rich men, in a sitting of the senate, seeing they could not prevail 
<A NAME="552"></A>upon the consul to espouse their quarrel, had come to a final determination 
<A NAME="553"></A>amongst themselves that he should be assassinated, and to that purpose 
<A NAME="554"></A>had a great number of their friends and servants ready armed to accomplish 
<A NAME="555"></A>it. Tiberius no sooner communicated this confederacy to those about him, 
<A NAME="556"></A>but they immediately tucked up their gowns, broke the halberts which the 
<A NAME="557"></A>officers used to keep the crowd off into pieces, and distributed them among 
<A NAME="558"></A>themselves, resolving to resist the attack with these. Those who stood 
<A NAME="559"></A>at a distance wondered, and asked what was the occasion; Tiberius, knowing 
<A NAME="560"></A>that they could not hear him at that distance, lifted his hand to his head 
<A NAME="561"></A>wishing to intimate the great danger which he apprehended himself to be 
<A NAME="562"></A>in. His adversaries, taking notice of that action, ran off at once to the 
<A NAME="563"></A>senate-house, and declared that Tiberius desired the people to bestow a 
<A NAME="564"></A>crown upon him, as if this were the meaning of his touching his head. This 
<A NAME="565"></A>news created general confusion in the senators, and Nasica at once called 
<A NAME="566"></A>upon the consul to punish this tyrant, and defend the government. The consul 
<A NAME="567"></A>mildly replied, that he would not be the first to do any violence; and 
<A NAME="568"></A>as he would not suffer any freeman to be put to death, before sentence 
<A NAME="569"></A>had lawfully passed upon him, so neither would he allow any measure to 
<A NAME="570"></A>be carried into effect, if by persuasion or compulsion on the part of Tiberius 
<A NAME="571"></A>the people had been induced to pass an unlawful vote. But Nasica, rising 
<A NAME="572"></A>from his seat, "Since the consul," said he, "regards not the safety of 
<A NAME="573"></A>the commonwealth, let every one who will defend the laws, follow me." He 
<A NAME="574"></A>then, casting the skirt of his gown over his head, hastened to the capitol; 
<A NAME="575"></A>those who bore him company, wrapped their gowns also about their arms, 
<A NAME="576"></A>and forced their way after him. And as they were persons of the greatest 
<A NAME="577"></A>authority in the city, the common people did not venture to obstruct their 
<A NAME="578"></A>passing, but were rather so eager to clear the way for them, that they 
<A NAME="579"></A>tumbled over one another in haste. The attendants they brought with them 
<A NAME="580"></A>had furnished themselves with clubs and staves from their houses, and they 
<A NAME="581"></A>themselves picked up the feet and other fragments of stools and chairs, 
<A NAME="582"></A>which were broken by the hasty flight of the common people. Thus armed, 
<A NAME="583"></A>they made towards Tiberius, knocking down those whom they found in front 
<A NAME="584"></A>of him, and those were soon wholly dispersed and many of them slain. Tiberius 
<A NAME="585"></A>tried to save himself by flight. As he was running, he was stopped by one 
<A NAME="586"></A>who caught hold of him by the gown; but he threw it off, and fled in his 
<A NAME="587"></A>under-garment only. And stumbling over those who before had been knocked 
<A NAME="588"></A>down, as he was endeavouring to get up again, Publius Satureius, a tribune, 
<A NAME="589"></A>one of his colleagues, was observed to give him the first fatal stroke, 
<A NAME="590"></A>by hitting him upon the head with the foot of a stool. The second blow 
<A NAME="591"></A>was claimed, as though it had been a deed to be proud of, by Lucius Rufus. 
<A NAME="592"></A>And of the rest there fell above three hundred killed by clubs and staves 
<A NAME="593"></A>only, none by an iron weapon.
<A NAME="594"></A><BR><BR>This, we are told, was the first sedition amongst the Romans, since 
<A NAME="595"></A>the abrogation of kingly government, that ended in the effusion of blood. 
<A NAME="596"></A>All former quarrels which were neither small nor about trivial matters, 
<A NAME="597"></A>were always amicably composed, by mutual concessions on either side, the 
<A NAME="598"></A>senate yielding for fear of the commons, and the commons out of respect 
<A NAME="599"></A>to the senate. And it is probable indeed that Tiberius himself might then 
<A NAME="600"></A>have been easily induced, by mere persuasion, to give way, and certainly, 
<A NAME="601"></A>if attacked at all, must have yielded without any recourse to violence 
<A NAME="602"></A>and bloodshed, as he had not at that time above three thousand men to support 
<A NAME="603"></A>him. But it is evident, that this conspiracy was fomented against him, 
<A NAME="604"></A>more out of the hatred and malice which the rich men had to his person, 
<A NAME="605"></A>than for the reasons which they commonly pretended against him. In testimony 
<A NAME="606"></A>of which we may adduce the cruelty and unnatural insults which they used 
<A NAME="607"></A>to his dead body. For they would not suffer his own brother, though he 
<A NAME="608"></A>earnestly begged the favour, to bury him in the night, but threw him, together 
<A NAME="609"></A>with the other corpses, into the river. Neither did their animosity stop 
<A NAME="610"></A>here; for they banished some of his friends without legal process, and 
<A NAME="611"></A>slew as many of the others as they could lay their hands on; amongst whom 
<A NAME="612"></A>Diophanes, the orator, was slain, and one Caius Villius cruelly murdered 
<A NAME="613"></A>by being shut up in a large tun with vipers and serpents. Blossius of Cuma, 
<A NAME="614"></A>indeed, was carried before the consuls, and examined touching what had 
<A NAME="615"></A>happened, and freely confessed that he had done, without scruple, whatever 
<A NAME="616"></A>Tiberius bade him. "What," cried Nasica, "then if Tiberius had bidden you 
<A NAME="617"></A>burn the capitol, would you have burnt it?" His first answer was, that 
<A NAME="618"></A>Tiberius never would have ordered any such thing; but being pressed with 
<A NAME="619"></A>the same question by several, he declared, "If Tiberius had commanded it, 
<A NAME="620"></A>it would have been right for me to do it; for he never would have commanded 
<A NAME="621"></A>it, if it had not been for the people's good." Blossius at this time was 
<A NAME="622"></A>pardoned, and afterwards went away to Aristonicus in Asia, and when Aristonicus 
<A NAME="623"></A>was overthrown and ruined, killed himself.
<A NAME="624"></A><BR><BR>The senate, to soothe the people after these transactions, did 
<A NAME="625"></A>not oppose the division of the public lands, and permitted them to choose 
<A NAME="626"></A>another commissioner in the room of Tiberius. So they elected Publius Crassus, 
<A NAME="627"></A>who was Gracchus's near connection, as his daughter Licinia was married 
<A NAME="628"></A>to Caius Gracchus; although Cornelius Nepos says, that it was not Crassus's 
<A NAME="629"></A>daughter whom Caius married, but Brutus's, who triumphed for his victories 
<A NAME="630"></A>over the Lusitanians: but most writers state it as we have done. The people, 
<A NAME="631"></A>however, showed evident marks of their anger at Tiberius's death; and were 
<A NAME="632"></A>clearly waiting only for the opportunity to be revenged, and Nasica was 
<A NAME="633"></A>already threatened with an impeachment. The senate, therefore, fearing 
<A NAME="634"></A>lest some mischief should befall him, sent him ambassador into Asia, though 
<A NAME="635"></A>there was no occasion for his going thither. For the people did not conceal 
<A NAME="636"></A>their indignation even in the open streets, but railed at him, whenever 
<A NAME="637"></A>they met him abroad calling him a murderer and a tyrant, one who had polluted 
<A NAME="638"></A>the most holy and religious spot in Rome with the blood of a sacred and 
<A NAME="639"></A>inviolable magistrate. And so Nasica left Italy, although he was bound, 
<A NAME="640"></A>being the chief priest, to officiate in all principal sacrifices. Thus 
<A NAME="641"></A>wandering wretchedly and ignominiously from one place to another, he died 
<A NAME="642"></A>in a short time after, not far from Pergamus. It is no wonder that the 
<A NAME="643"></A>people had such an aversion to Nasica, when even Scipio Africanus, though 
<A NAME="644"></A>so much and so deservedly beloved by the Romans, was in danger of quite 
<A NAME="645"></A>losing the good opinion which the people had of him, only for repeating, 
<A NAME="646"></A>when the news of Tiberius's death was first brought to Numantia, the verse 
<A NAME="647"></A>out of Homer-
<A NAME="648"></A><BR><BR>"Even so perish all who do the same." And afterwards, being asked 
<A NAME="649"></A>by Caius and Fulvius, in a great assembly, what he thought of Tiberius's 
<A NAME="650"></A>death, he gave an answer adverse to Tiberius's public actions. Upon which 
<A NAME="651"></A>account, the people thenceforth used to interrupt him when he spoke, which, 
<A NAME="652"></A>until that time, they had never done, and he, on the other hand, was induced 
<A NAME="653"></A>to speak ill of the people. But of this the particulars are given in the 
<A NAME="654"></A>life of Scipio.
