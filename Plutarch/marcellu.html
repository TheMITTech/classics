<BR>(legendary, died 208 B.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>They say that Marcus Claudius, who was five times consul of the Romans, 
<A NAME="11"></A>was the son of Marcus; and that he was the first of his family called Marcellus; 
<A NAME="12"></A>that is, martial, as Posidonius affirms. He was, indeed, by long experience, 
<A NAME="13"></A>skilful in the art of war, of a strong body, valiant of hand, and by natural 
<A NAME="14"></A>inclinations addicted to war. This high temper and heat he showed conspicuously 
<A NAME="15"></A>in battle; in other respects he was modest and obliging, and so far studious 
<A NAME="16"></A>of Greek learning and discipline, as to honour and admire those that excelled 
<A NAME="17"></A>in it, though he did not himself attain a proficiency in them equal to 
<A NAME="18"></A>his desire, by reason of his employments. For if ever there were any men 
<A NAME="19"></A>whom, as Homer says, Heaven
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><BR>"From their first youth unto their utmost age
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>Appointed the laborious wars to wage," certainly they were the chief 
<A NAME="22"></A>Romans of that time; who in their youth had war with the Carthaginians 
<A NAME="23"></A>in Sicily, in their middle age with the Gauls in the defence of Italy itself; 
<A NAME="24"></A>and at last, when now grown old, struggled again with Hannibal and the 
<A NAME="25"></A>Carthaginians, and wanted in their latest years what is granted to most 
<A NAME="26"></A>men, exemption from military toils; their rank and their great qualities 
<A NAME="27"></A>still making them be called upon to undertake the command.
<A NAME="28"></A><BR><BR>Marcellus, ignorant or unskillful of no kind of fighting, in single 
<A NAME="29"></A>combat surpassed himself; he never declined a challenge, and never accepted 
<A NAME="30"></A>without killing his challenger. In Sicily, he protected and saved his brother 
<A NAME="31"></A>Otacilius when surrounded in battle, and slew the enemies that pressed 
<A NAME="32"></A>upon him; for which act he was by the generals, while he was yet but young, 
<A NAME="33"></A>presented with crowns and other honourable rewards; and, his good qualities 
<A NAME="34"></A>more and more displaying themselves, he was created Curule Aedile by the 
<A NAME="35"></A>people and by the high priests Augur; which is that priesthood to which 
<A NAME="36"></A>chiefly the law assigns the observation of auguries. In his Aedileship, 
<A NAME="37"></A>a certain mischance brought him to the necessity of bringing an impeachment 
<A NAME="38"></A>into the senate. He had a son named Marcus, of great beauty, in the flower 
<A NAME="39"></A>of his age, and no less admired for the goodness of his character. This 
<A NAME="40"></A>youth, Capitolinus, a bold and ill-mannered man, Marcellus's colleague, 
<A NAME="41"></A>sought to abuse. The boy at first himself repelled him; but when the other 
<A NAME="42"></A>again persecuted him, told his father. Marcellus, highly indignant, accused 
<A NAME="43"></A>the man in the senate: where he, having appealed to the tribunes of the 
<A NAME="44"></A>people, endeavoured by various shifts and exceptions to elude the impeachment; 
<A NAME="45"></A>and, when the tribunes refused their protection, by flat denial rejected 
<A NAME="46"></A>the charge. As there was no witness of the fact, the senate thought fit 
<A NAME="47"></A>to call the youth himself before them: on witnessing whose blushes and 
<A NAME="48"></A>tears, and shame mixed with the highest indignation, seeking no further 
<A NAME="49"></A>evidence of the crime, they condemned Capitolinus, and set a fine upon 
<A NAME="50"></A>him; of the money of which Marcellus caused silver vessels for libation 
<A NAME="51"></A>to be made, which he dedicated to the gods.
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR>After the end of the first Punic war, which lasted one-and-twenty 
<A NAME="53"></A>years, the seed of Gallic tumults sprang up, and began again to trouble 
<A NAME="54"></A>Rome. The Insubrians, a people inhabiting the subalpine region of Italy, 
<A NAME="55"></A>strong in their own forces, raised from among the other Gauls aids of mercenary 
<A NAME="56"></A>soldiers, called Gaesatae. And it was a sort of miracle, and special good 
<A NAME="57"></A>fortune for Rome, that the Gallic war was not coincident with the Punic, 
<A NAME="58"></A>but that the Gauls had with fidelity stood quiet as spectators, while the 
<A NAME="59"></A>Punic war continued, as though they had been under engagement to await 
<A NAME="60"></A>and attack the victors, and now only were at liberty to come forward. Still 
<A NAME="61"></A>the position itself, and the ancient renown of the Gauls, struck no little 
<A NAME="62"></A>fear into the minds of the Romans, who were about to undertake a war so 
<A NAME="63"></A>near home and upon their own borders; and regarded the Gauls, because they 
<A NAME="64"></A>had once taken their city, with more apprehension than any people, as is 
<A NAME="65"></A>apparent from the enactment which from that time forth provided, that the 
<A NAME="66"></A>high priests should enjoy an exemption from all military duty, except only 
<A NAME="67"></A>in Gallic insurrections.
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR>The great preparations, also, made by the Romans for war (for it 
<A NAME="69"></A>is not reported that the people of Rome ever had at one time so many legions 
<A NAME="70"></A>in arms, either before or since), and their extraordinary sacrifices, were 
<A NAME="71"></A>plain arguments of their fear. For though they were most averse to barbarous 
<A NAME="72"></A>and cruel rites, and entertained more than any nation the same pious and 
<A NAME="73"></A>reverent sentiments of the gods with the Greeks; yet, when this war was 
<A NAME="74"></A>coming upon them, they then, from some prophecies in the Sibyls' books, 
<A NAME="75"></A>put alive underground a pair of Greeks, one male, the other female; and 
<A NAME="76"></A>likewise two Gauls, one of each sex, in the market called the beast market: 
<A NAME="77"></A>continuing even to this day to offer to these Greeks and Gauls certain 
<A NAME="78"></A>ceremonial observances in the month of November.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>In the beginning of this war, in which the Romans sometimes obtained 
<A NAME="80"></A>remarkable victories, sometimes were shamefully beaten, nothing was done 
<A NAME="81"></A>toward the determination of the contest until Flaminius and Furius, being 
<A NAME="82"></A>consuls, led large forces against the Insubrians. At the time of their 
<A NAME="83"></A>departure, the river that runs through the country of Picenum was seen 
<A NAME="84"></A>flowing with blood; there was a report that three moons had once been seen 
<A NAME="85"></A>at Ariminum; and, in the consular assembly, the augurs declared that the 
<A NAME="86"></A>consuls had been unduly and inauspiciously created. The senate, therefore, 
<A NAME="87"></A>immediately sent letters to the camp, recalling the consuls to Rome with 
<A NAME="88"></A>all possible speed, and commanding them to forbear from acting against 
<A NAME="89"></A>the enemies, and to abdicate the consulship on the first opportunity. These 
<A NAME="90"></A>letters being brought to Flaminius, he deferred to open them till, having 
<A NAME="91"></A>defeated and put to flight the enemy's forces, he wasted and ravaged their 
<A NAME="92"></A>borders. The people, therefore, did not go forth to meet him when he returned 
<A NAME="93"></A>with huge spoils; nay, because he had not instantly obeyed the command 
<A NAME="94"></A>in the letters, by which he was recalled, but slighted and contemned them, 
<A NAME="95"></A>they were very near denying him the honour of a triumph. Nor was the triumph 
<A NAME="96"></A>sooner passed than they deposed him, with his colleague, from the magistracy, 
<A NAME="97"></A>and reduced them to the state of private citizens. So much were all things 
<A NAME="98"></A>at Rome made to depend upon religion; they would not allow any contempt 
<A NAME="99"></A>of the omens and the ancient rites, even though attended with the highest 
<A NAME="100"></A>success: thinking it to be of more importance to the public safety that 
<A NAME="101"></A>the magistrates should reverence the gods, than that they should overcome 
<A NAME="102"></A>their enemies. Thus Tiberius Sempronius, whom for his probity and virtue 
<A NAME="103"></A>the citizens highly esteemed, created Scipio Nasica and Caius Marcius consuls 
<A NAME="104"></A>to succeed him; and when they were gone into their provinces, lit upon 
<A NAME="105"></A>books concerning the religious observances, where he found something he 
<A NAME="106"></A>had not known before; which was this. When the consul took his auspices, 
<A NAME="107"></A>he sat without the city in a house, or tent, hired for that occasion; but, 
<A NAME="108"></A>if it happened that he, for any urgent cause, returned into the city, without 
<A NAME="109"></A>having yet seen any certain signs, he was obliged to leave that first building, 
<A NAME="110"></A>or tent, and to seek another to repeat the survey from. Tiberius, it appears, 
<A NAME="111"></A>in ignorance of this, had twice used the same building before announcing 
<A NAME="112"></A>the new consuls. Now, understanding his error, he referred the matter to 
<A NAME="113"></A>the senate: nor did the senate neglect this minute fault, but soon wrote 
<A NAME="114"></A>expressly of it to Scipio Nasica and Caius Marcius; who, leaving their 
<A NAME="115"></A>provinces and without delay returning to Rome, laid down their magistracy. 
<A NAME="116"></A>This happened at a later period. About the same time, too, the priesthood 
<A NAME="117"></A>was taken away from two men of very great honour, Cornelius Cethegus and 
<A NAME="118"></A>Quintus Sulpicius: from the former, because he had not rightly held out 
<A NAME="119"></A>the entrails of a beast slain for sacrifice; from the latter, because, 
<A NAME="120"></A>while he was immolating, the tufted cap which the Flamens wear had fallen 
<A NAME="121"></A>from his head. Minucius, the dictator, who had already named Caius Flaminius 
<A NAME="122"></A>master of the horse, they deposed from his command, because the squeak 
<A NAME="123"></A>of a mouse was heard, and put others into their places. And yet, notwithstanding, 
<A NAME="124"></A>by observing so anxiously these little niceties they did not run into any 
<A NAME="125"></A>superstition, because they never varied from nor exceeded the observances 
<A NAME="126"></A>of their ancestors.
<A NAME="127"></A><BR><BR>So soon as Flaminius with his colleague had resigned the consulate, 
<A NAME="128"></A>Marcellus was declared consul by the presiding officers called Interrexes; 
<A NAME="129"></A>and, entering into the magistracy, chose Cnaeus Cornelius his colleague. 
<A NAME="130"></A>There was a report that, the Gauls proposing a pacification, and the senate 
<A NAME="131"></A>also inclining to peace, Marcellus inflamed the people to war; but a peace 
<A NAME="132"></A>appears to have been agreed upon, which the Gaesatae broke; who, passing 
<A NAME="133"></A>the Alps, stirred up the Insubrians (they being thirty thousand in number, 
<A NAME="134"></A>and the Insubrians more numerous by far); and proud of their strength, 
<A NAME="135"></A>marched directly to Acerrae, a city seated on the north of the river Po. 
<A NAME="136"></A>From thence Britomartus, king of the Gaesatae, taking with him ten thousand 
<A NAME="137"></A>soldiers, harassed the country round about. News of which being brought 
<A NAME="138"></A>to Marcellus, leaving his colleague at Acerrae with the foot and all the 
<A NAME="139"></A>heavy arms and a third part of the horse, and carrying with him the rest 
<A NAME="140"></A>of the horse and six hundred light-armed foot, marching night and day without 
<A NAME="141"></A>remission, he stayed not till he came up to these ten thousand near a Gaulish 
<A NAME="142"></A>village called Clastidium, which not long before had been reduced under 
<A NAME="143"></A>the Roman jurisdiction. Nor had he time to refresh his soldiers or to give 
<A NAME="144"></A>them rest. For the barbarians, that were then present, immediately observed 
<A NAME="145"></A>his approach, and contemned him, because he had very few foot with him. 
<A NAME="146"></A>The Gauls were singularly skilful in horsemanship, and thought to excel 
<A NAME="147"></A>in it; and as at present they also exceeded Marcellus in number, they made 
<A NAME="148"></A>no account of him. They, therefore, with their king at their head, instantly 
<A NAME="149"></A>charged upon him, as if they would trample him under their horses' feet, 
<A NAME="150"></A>threatening all kinds of cruelties. Marcellus, because his men were few, 
<A NAME="151"></A>that they might not be encompassed and charged on all sides by the enemy, 
<A NAME="152"></A>extended his wings of horse, and, riding about, drew out his wings of foot 
<A NAME="153"></A>in length, till he came near to the enemy. Just as he was in the act of 
<A NAME="154"></A>turning round to face the enemy, it so happened that his horse, startled 
<A NAME="155"></A>with their fierce look and their cries, gave back, and carried him forcibly 
<A NAME="156"></A>aside. Fearing lest this accident, if converted into an omen, might discourage 
<A NAME="157"></A>his soldiers, he quickly brought his horse round to confront the enemy, 
<A NAME="158"></A>and made a gesture of adoration to the sun, as if he had wheeled about 
<A NAME="159"></A>not by chance, but for a purpose of devotion. For it was customary to the 
<A NAME="160"></A>Romans, when they offered worship to the gods, to turn round; and in this 
<A NAME="161"></A>moment of meeting the enemy, he is said to have vowed the best of the arms 
<A NAME="162"></A>to Jupiter Feretrius.
<A NAME="163"></A><BR><BR>The king of the Gauls beholding Marcellus, and from the badges 
<A NAME="164"></A>of his authority conjecturing him to be the general, advanced some way 
<A NAME="165"></A>before his embattled army, and with a loud voice challenged him, and, brandishing 
<A NAME="166"></A>his lance, fiercely ran in full career at him; exceeding the rest of the 
<A NAME="167"></A>Gauls in stature, and with his armour, that was adorned with gold and silver 
<A NAME="168"></A>and various colours, shining like lightning. These arms seeming to Marcellus, 
<A NAME="169"></A>while he viewed the enemy's army drawn up in battalia, to be the best and 
<A NAME="170"></A>fairest, and thinking them to be those he had vowed to Jupiter, he instantly 
<A NAME="171"></A>ran upon the king, and pierced through his breastplate with his lance; 
<A NAME="172"></A>then pressing upon him with the weight of his horse, threw him to the ground, 
<A NAME="173"></A>and with two or three strokes more slew him. Immediately he leapt from 
<A NAME="174"></A>his horse, laid his hand upon the dead king's arm and, looking up towards 
<A NAME="175"></A>Heaven, thus spoke: "O Jupiter Feretrius, arbiter of the exploits of captains, 
<A NAME="176"></A>and of the acts of commanders in war and battles, be thou witness that 
<A NAME="177"></A>I, a general, have slain a general: I, a consul, have slain a king with 
<A NAME="178"></A>my own hand, third of all the Romans; and that to thee I consecrate these 
<A NAME="179"></A>first and most excellent of the spoils. Grant to us to despatch the relics 
<A NAME="180"></A>of the war with the same course of fortune." Then the Roman horse joining 
<A NAME="181"></A>battle not only with the enemy's horse, but also with the foot who attacked 
<A NAME="182"></A>them, obtained a singular and unheard-of victory. For never before or since 
<A NAME="183"></A>have so few horse defeated such numerous forces of horse and foot together. 
<A NAME="184"></A>The enemies being to a great number slain, and the spoils collected, he 
<A NAME="185"></A>returned to his colleague, who was conducting the war, with ill-success, 
<A NAME="186"></A>against the enemies near the greatest and most populous of the Gallic cities, 
<A NAME="187"></A>Milan. This was their capital, and, therefore, fighting valiantly in defence 
<A NAME="188"></A>of it, they were not so much besieged by Cornelius, as they besieged him. 
<A NAME="189"></A>But Marcellus having returned, and the Gaesatae retiring as soon as they 
<A NAME="190"></A>were certified of the death of the king and the defeat of his army, Milan 
<A NAME="191"></A>was taken. The rest of their towns, and all they had, the Gauls delivered 
<A NAME="192"></A>up of their own accord to the Romans, and had peace upon equitable conditions 
<A NAME="193"></A>granted to them.
<A NAME="194"></A><BR><BR>Marcellus alone, by a decree of the senate, triumphed. The triumph 
<A NAME="195"></A>was in magnificence, opulence, spoils, and the gigantic bodies of the captives 
<A NAME="196"></A>most remarkable. But the most grateful and most rare spectacle of all was 
<A NAME="197"></A>the general himself, carrying the arms of the barbarian king to the god 
<A NAME="198"></A>to whom he had vowed them. He had taken a tall and straight stock of an 
<A NAME="199"></A>oak, and had lopped and formed it to a trophy. Upon this he fastened and 
<A NAME="200"></A>hung about the arms of the king, arranging all the pieces in their suitable 
<A NAME="201"></A>places. The procession advancing solemnly, he, carrying this trophy, ascended 
<A NAME="202"></A>the chariot; and thus, himself the fairest and most glorious triumphant 
<A NAME="203"></A>image, was conveyed into the city. The army adorned with shining armour 
<A NAME="204"></A>followed in order, and with verses composed for the occasion, and with 
<A NAME="205"></A>songs of victory celebrated the praises of Jupiter and of their general. 
<A NAME="206"></A>Then entering the temple of Jupiter Feretrius, he dedicated his gift; the 
<A NAME="207"></A>third, and to our memory the last, that ever did so. The first was Romulus, 
<A NAME="208"></A>after having slain Acron, king of the Caeninenses: the second, Cornelius 
<A NAME="209"></A>Cossus, who slew Tolumnius the Etruscan: after them Marcellus, having killed 
<A NAME="210"></A>Britomartus, king of the Gauls; after Marcellus, no man. The god to whom 
<A NAME="211"></A>these spoils were consecrated is called Jupiter Feretrius, from the trophy 
<A NAME="212"></A>carried on the feretrum, one of the Greek words which at that time still 
<A NAME="213"></A>existed in great numbers in Latin: or, as others say, it is the surname 
<A NAME="214"></A>of the Thundering Jupiter derived from ferire, to strike. Others there 
<A NAME="215"></A>are who would have the name to be deduced from the strokes that are given 
<A NAME="216"></A>in fight; since even now in battles, when they press upon their enemies, 
<A NAME="217"></A>they constantly call out to each other, strike, in Latin feri. Spoils in 
<A NAME="218"></A>general they call Spolia, and these in particular Opima; though, indeed, 
<A NAME="219"></A>they say that Numa Pompilius, in his commentaries, makes mention of first, 
<A NAME="220"></A>second, and third Spolia Opima; and that he prescribes that the first taken 
<A NAME="221"></A>be consecrated to Jupiter Feretrius, the second to Mars, the third to Quirinus; 
<A NAME="222"></A>as also that the reward of the first be three hundred asses; of the second, 
<A NAME="223"></A>two hundred; of the third, one hundred. The general account, however, prevails, 
<A NAME="224"></A>that those spoils only are Opima which the general first takes in set battle, 
<A NAME="225"></A>and takes from the enemy's chief captain whom he has slain with his own 
<A NAME="226"></A>hand. But of this enough. The victory and the ending of the war was so 
<A NAME="227"></A>welcome to the people of Rome, that they sent to Apollo of Delphi, in testimony 
<A NAME="228"></A>of their gratitude, a present of a golden cup of an hundred pound weight, 
<A NAME="229"></A>and gave a great part of the spoil to their associate cities, and took 
<A NAME="230"></A>care that many presents should be sent also to Hiero, King of the Syracusans, 
<A NAME="231"></A>their friend and ally.
<A NAME="232"></A><BR><BR>When Hannibal invaded Italy, Marcellus was despatched with a fleet 
<A NAME="233"></A>to Sicily. And when the army had been defeated at Cannae, and many thousands 
<A NAME="234"></A>of them perished, and a few had saved themselves by flying to Canusium, 
<A NAME="235"></A>and all feared lest Hannibal, who had destroyed the strength of the Roman 
<A NAME="236"></A>army, should advance at once with his victorious troops to Rome, Marcellus 
<A NAME="237"></A>first sent for the protection of the city fifteen hundred soldiers from 
<A NAME="238"></A>the fleet. Then, by decree of the senate, going to Canusium, having heard 
<A NAME="239"></A>that many of the soldiers had come together in that place, he led them 
<A NAME="240"></A>out of the fortifications to prevent the enemy from ravaging the country. 
<A NAME="241"></A>The chief Roman commanders had most of them fallen in battles; and the 
<A NAME="242"></A>citizens complained that the extreme caution of Fabius Maximus, whose integrity 
<A NAME="243"></A>and wisdom gave him the highest authority, verged upon timidity and inaction. 
<A NAME="244"></A>They confided in him to keep them out of danger, but could not expect that 
<A NAME="245"></A>he would enable them to retaliate. Fixing, therefore, their thoughts upon 
<A NAME="246"></A>Marcellus, and hoping to combine his boldness, confidence, and promptitude 
<A NAME="247"></A>with Fabius's caution and prudence, and to temper the one by the other, 
<A NAME="248"></A>they sent, sometimes both with consular command, sometimes one as consul, 
<A NAME="249"></A>the other as proconsul, against the enemy. Posidonius writes, that Fabius 
<A NAME="250"></A>was called the buckler, Marcellus the sword of Rome. Certainly, Hannibal 
<A NAME="251"></A>himself confessed that he feared Fabius as a schoolmaster, Marcellus as 
<A NAME="252"></A>an adversary: the former, lest he should be hindered from doing mischief; 
<A NAME="253"></A>the latter, lest he should receive harm himself.
<A NAME="254"></A><BR><BR>And first, when among Hannibal's soldiers, proud of their victory, 
<A NAME="255"></A>carelessness and boldness had grown to a great height, Marcellus, attacking 
<A NAME="256"></A>all their stragglers and plundering parties, cut them off, and by little 
<A NAME="257"></A>and little diminished their forces. Then carrying aid to the Neopolitans 
<A NAME="258"></A>and Nolans, he confirmed the minds of the former, who, indeed, were of 
<A NAME="259"></A>their own accord faithful enough to the Romans; but in Nola he found a 
<A NAME="260"></A>state of discord, the senate not being able to rule and keep in the common 
<A NAME="261"></A>people, who were generally favourers of Hannibal. There was in the town 
<A NAME="262"></A>one Bantius, a man renowned for his high birth and courage. This man, after 
<A NAME="263"></A>he had fought most fiercely at Cannae, and had killed many of the enemies, 
<A NAME="264"></A>at last was found lying in a heap of dead bodies, covered with darts, and 
<A NAME="265"></A>was brought to Hannibal, who so honoured him, that he not only dismissed 
<A NAME="266"></A>him without ransom, but also contracted friendship with him, and made him 
<A NAME="267"></A>his guest. In gratitude for this great favour, he became one of the strongest 
<A NAME="268"></A>partisans of Hannibal, and urged the people to revolt. Marcellus could 
<A NAME="269"></A>not be induced to put to death a man of such eminence, and who had endured 
<A NAME="270"></A>such dangers in fighting on the Roman side; but, knowing himself able, 
<A NAME="271"></A>by the general kindliness of his disposition, and in particular by the 
<A NAME="272"></A>attractiveness of his address, to gain over a character whose passion was 
<A NAME="273"></A>for honour, one day when Bantius saluted him, he asked him who he was; 
<A NAME="274"></A>not that he knew him not before, but seeking an occasion of further conference. 
<A NAME="275"></A>When Bantius had told who he was, Marcellus, seeming surprised with joy 
<A NAME="276"></A>and wonder, replied: "Are you that Bantius whom the Romans commend above 
<A NAME="277"></A>the rest that fought at Cannae, and praise as the one man that not only 
<A NAME="278"></A>did not forsake the consul Paulus Aemilius, but received in his own body 
<A NAME="279"></A>many darts thrown at him?" Bantius owning himself to be that very man, 
<A NAME="280"></A>and showing his scars: "Why, then," said Marcellus, "did not you, having 
<A NAME="281"></A>such proofs to show of your affection to us, come to me at my first arrival 
<A NAME="282"></A>here? Do you think that we are unwilling to requite with favour those who 
<A NAME="283"></A>have well deserved, and who are honoured even by our enemies?" He followed 
<A NAME="284"></A>up his courtesies by a present of a war-horse and five hundred drachmas 
<A NAME="285"></A>in money. From that time Bantius became the most faithful assistant and 
<A NAME="286"></A>ally of Marcellus, and a most keen discoverer of those that attempted innovation 
<A NAME="287"></A>and sedition.
<A NAME="288"></A><BR><BR>These were many, and had entered into a conspiracy to plunder the 
<A NAME="289"></A>baggage of the Romans, when they should make an irruption against the enemy. 
<A NAME="290"></A>Marcellus, therefore, having marshalled his army within the city, placed 
<A NAME="291"></A>the baggage near to the gates, and, by an edict, forbade the Nolans to 
<A NAME="292"></A>go to the walls. Thus, outside the city, no arms could be seen; by which 
<A NAME="293"></A>prudent device he allured Hannibal to move with his army in some disorder 
<A NAME="294"></A>to the city, thinking that things were in a tumult there. Then Marcellus, 
<A NAME="295"></A>the nearest gate being, as he had commanded, thrown open, issuing forth 
<A NAME="296"></A>with the flower of his horse in front, charged the enemy. By and by the 
<A NAME="297"></A>foot, sallying out of another gate, with a loud shout joined in the battle. 
<A NAME="298"></A>And while Hannibal opposes part of his forces to these, the third gate 
<A NAME="299"></A>also is opened, out of which the rest break forth, and on all quarters 
<A NAME="300"></A>fall upon the enemies, who were dismayed at this unexpected encounter, 
<A NAME="301"></A>and did but feebly resist those with whom they had been first engaged, 
<A NAME="302"></A>because of their attack by these others who sallied out later. Here Hannibal's 
<A NAME="303"></A>soldiers, with much bloodshed and many wounds, were beaten back to their 
<A NAME="304"></A>camp, and for the first time turned their backs to the Romans. There fell 
<A NAME="305"></A>in this action, as it is related, more than five thousand of them; of the 
<A NAME="306"></A>Romans, not above five hundred. Livy does not affirm that either the victory 
<A NAME="307"></A>or the slaughter of the enemy was so great; but certain it is that the 
<A NAME="308"></A>adventure brought great glory to Marcellus, and to the Romans, after their 
<A NAME="309"></A>calamities, a great revival of confidence, as they began now to entertain 
<A NAME="310"></A>a hope that the enemy with whom they contended was not invincible, but 
<A NAME="311"></A>liable like themselves to defeats.
<A NAME="312"></A><BR><BR>Therefore, the other consul being deceased, the people recalled 
<A NAME="313"></A>Marcellus, that they might put him into his place; and, in spite of the 
<A NAME="314"></A>magistrates, succeeded in postponing the election till his arrival, when 
<A NAME="315"></A>he was by all the suffrages created consul. But because it happened to 
<A NAME="316"></A>thunder, the augurs accounting that he was not legitimately created, and 
<A NAME="317"></A>yet not daring, for fear of the people, to declare their sentence openly, 
<A NAME="318"></A>Marcellus voluntarily resigned the consulate, retaining however his command. 
<A NAME="319"></A>Being created proconsul, and returning to the camp at Nola, he proceeded 
<A NAME="320"></A>to harass those that followed the party of the Carthaginians; on whose 
<A NAME="321"></A>coming with speed to succour them, Marcellus declined a challenge to a 
<A NAME="322"></A>set battle, but when Hannibal had sent out a party to plunder, and now 
<A NAME="323"></A>expected no fight, he broke out upon him with his army. He had distributed 
<A NAME="324"></A>to the foot long lances, such as are commonly used in naval fights; and 
<A NAME="325"></A>instructed them to throw them with great force at convenient distances 
<A NAME="326"></A>against the enemies, who were inexperienced in that way of darting, and 
<A NAME="327"></A>used to fight with short darts hand to hand. This seems to have been the 
<A NAME="328"></A>cause of the total rout and open flight of all the Carthaginians who were 
<A NAME="329"></A>then engaged; there fell of them five thousand; four elephants were killed, 
<A NAME="330"></A>and two taken; but what was of the greatest moment, on the third day after, 
<A NAME="331"></A>more than three hundred horse, Spaniards and Numidians mixed, deserted 
<A NAME="332"></A>to him, a disaster that had never to that day happened to Hannibal, who 
<A NAME="333"></A>had kept together in harmony an army of barbarians, collected out of many 
<A NAME="334"></A>various and discordant nations. Marcellus and his successors in all this 
<A NAME="335"></A>war made good use of the faithful service of these horsemen.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR><BR>He now was a third time created consul, and sailed over into Sicily. 
<A NAME="337"></A>For the success of Hannibal had excited the Carthaginians to lay claim 
<A NAME="338"></A>to that whole island; chiefly because, after the murder of the tyrant Hieronymus, 
<A NAME="339"></A>all things had been in tumult and confusion at Syracuse. For which reason 
<A NAME="340"></A>the Romans also had sent before to that city a force under the conduct 
<A NAME="341"></A>of Appius, as praetor. While Marcellus was receiving that army, a number 
<A NAME="342"></A>of Roman soldiers cast themselves at his feet, upon occasion of the following 
<A NAME="343"></A>calamity. Of those that survived the battle at Cannae, some had escaped 
<A NAME="344"></A>by flight, and some were taken alive by the enemy; so great a multitude, 
<A NAME="345"></A>that it was thought there were not remaining Romans enough to defend the 
<A NAME="346"></A>wall of the city. And yet the magnanimity and constancy of the city was 
<A NAME="347"></A>such, that it would not redeem the captives from Hannibal, though it might 
<A NAME="348"></A>have done so for a small ransom; a decree of the senate forbade it, and 
<A NAME="349"></A>chose rather to leave them to be killed by the enemy, or sold out of Italy; 
<A NAME="350"></A>and commanded that all who had saved themselves by flight should be transported 
<A NAME="351"></A>into Sicily, and not permitted to return into Italy, until the war with 
<A NAME="352"></A>Hannibal should be ended. These, therefore, when Marcellus was arrived 
<A NAME="353"></A>in Sicily, addressed themselves to him in great numbers; and casting themselves 
<A NAME="354"></A>at his feet, with much lamentation and tears humbly besought him to admit 
<A NAME="355"></A>them to honourable service; and promised to make it appear by their future 
<A NAME="356"></A>fidelity and exertions that that defeat had been received rather by misfortune 
<A NAME="357"></A>than by cowardice. Marcellus, pitying them, petitioned the senate by letters, 
<A NAME="358"></A>that he might have leave at all times to recruit his legions out of them. 
<A NAME="359"></A>After much debate about the thing, the senate decreed they were of opinion 
<A NAME="360"></A>that the commonwealth did not require the service of cowardly soldiers; 
<A NAME="361"></A>if Marcellus perhaps thought otherwise, he might make use of them, provided 
<A NAME="362"></A>no one of them be honoured on any occasion with a crown or military gift, 
<A NAME="363"></A>as a reward of his virtue or courage. This decree stung Marcellus; and 
<A NAME="364"></A>on his return to Rome, after the Sicilian war was ended, he upbraided the 
<A NAME="365"></A>senate that they had denied to him, who had so highly deserved of the republic, 
<A NAME="366"></A>liberty to relieve so great a number of citizens in great 
<A NAME="367"></A>calamity.
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR>At this time Marcellus, first incensed by injuries done him by 
<A NAME="369"></A>Hippocrates, commander of the Syracusans (who, to give proof of his good 
<A NAME="370"></A>affection to the Carthaginians, and to acquire the tyranny to himself, 
<A NAME="371"></A>had killed a number of Romans at Leontini), besieged and took by force 
<A NAME="372"></A>the city of Leontini; yet violated none of the townsmen; only deserters, 
<A NAME="373"></A>as many as he took, he subjected to the punishment of the rods and axe. 
<A NAME="374"></A>But Hippocrates, sending a report to Syracuse, that Marcellus had put all 
<A NAME="375"></A>the adult population to the sword, and then coming upon the Syracusans, 
<A NAME="376"></A>who had risen in tumult upon that false report, made himself master of 
<A NAME="377"></A>the city. Upon this Marcellus moved with his whole army to Syracuse, and 
<A NAME="378"></A>encamping near the wall, sent ambassadors into the city to relate to the 
<A NAME="379"></A>Syracusans the truth of what had been done in Leontini. When these could 
<A NAME="380"></A>not prevail by treaty, the whole power being now in the hands of Hippocrates, 
<A NAME="381"></A>he proceeded to attack the city both by land and by sea. The land forces 
<A NAME="382"></A>were conducted by Appius: Marcellus, with sixty galleys, each with five 
<A NAME="383"></A>rows of oars, furnished with all sorts of arms and missiles, and a huge 
<A NAME="384"></A>bridge of planks laid upon eight ships chained together, upon which was 
<A NAME="385"></A>carried the engine to cast stones and darts, assaulted the walls, relying 
<A NAME="386"></A>on the abundance and magnificence of his preparations, and on his own previous 
<A NAME="387"></A>glory; all which, however, were, it would seem, but trifles for Archimedes 
<A NAME="388"></A>and his machines.
<A NAME="389"></A><BR><BR>These machines he had designed and contrived, not as matters of 
<A NAME="390"></A>any importance, but as mere amusements in geometry; in compliance with 
<A NAME="391"></A>King Hiero's desire and request, some little time before, that he should 
<A NAME="392"></A>reduce to practice some part of his admirable speculation in science, and 
<A NAME="393"></A>by accommodating the theoretic truth to sensation and ordinary use, bring 
<A NAME="394"></A>it more within the appreciation of the people in general. Eudoxus and Archytas 
<A NAME="395"></A>had been the first originators of this far-famed and highly-prized art 
<A NAME="396"></A>of mechanics, which they employed as an elegant illustration of geometrical 
<A NAME="397"></A>truths, and as means of sustaining experimentally, to the satisfaction 
<A NAME="398"></A>of the senses, conclusions too intricate for proof by words and diagrams. 
<A NAME="399"></A>As, for example, to solve the problem, so often required in constructing 
<A NAME="400"></A>geometrical figures, given the two extremes, to find the two mean lines 
<A NAME="401"></A>of a proportion, both these mathematicians had recourse to the aid of instruments, 
<A NAME="402"></A>adapting to their purpose certain curves and sections of lines. But what 
<A NAME="403"></A>with Plato's indignation at it, and his invectives against it as the mere 
<A NAME="404"></A>corruption and annihilation of the one good of geometry, which was thus 
<A NAME="405"></A>shamefully turning its back upon the unembodied objects of pure intelligence 
<A NAME="406"></A>to recur to sensation, and to ask help (not to be obtained without base 
<A NAME="407"></A>supervisions and depravation) from matter; so it was that mechanics came 
<A NAME="408"></A>to be separated from geometry, and, repudiated and neglected by philosophers, 
<A NAME="409"></A>took its place as a military art. Archimedes, however, in writing to King 
<A NAME="410"></A>Hiero, whose friend and near relation he was, had stated that given the 
<A NAME="411"></A>force, any given weight might be moved, and even boasted, we are told, 
<A NAME="412"></A>relying on the strength of demonstration, that if there were another earth, 
<A NAME="413"></A>by going into it he could remove this. Hiero being struck with amazement 
<A NAME="414"></A>at this, and entreating him to make good this problem by actual experiment, 
<A NAME="415"></A>and show some great weight moved by a small engine, he fixed accordingly 
<A NAME="416"></A>upon a ship of burden out of the king's arsenal, which could not be drawn 
<A NAME="417"></A>out of the dock without great labour and many men; and, loading her with 
<A NAME="418"></A>many passengers and a full freight, sitting himself the while far off, 
<A NAME="419"></A>with no great endeavour, but only holding the head of the pulley in his 
<A NAME="420"></A>hand and drawing the cords by degrees, he drew the ship in a straight line, 
<A NAME="421"></A>as smoothly and evenly as if she had been in the sea. The king, astonished 
<A NAME="422"></A>at this, and convinced of the power of the art, prevailed upon Archimedes 
<A NAME="423"></A>to make him engines accommodated to all the purposes, offensive and defensive, 
<A NAME="424"></A>of a siege. These the king himself never made use of, because he spent 
<A NAME="425"></A>almost all his life in a profound quiet and the highest affluence. But 
<A NAME="426"></A>the apparatus was, in most opportune time, ready at hand for the Syracusans, 
<A NAME="427"></A>and with it also the engineer himself.
<A NAME="428"></A><BR><BR>When, therefore, the Romans assaulted the walls in two places at 
<A NAME="429"></A>once, fear and consternation stupefied the Syracusans, believing that nothing 
<A NAME="430"></A>was able to resist that violence and those forces. But when Archimedes 
<A NAME="431"></A>began to ply his engines, he at once shot against the land forces all sorts 
<A NAME="432"></A>of missile weapons, and immense masses of stone that came down with incredible 
<A NAME="433"></A>noise and violence; against which no man could stand; for they knocked 
<A NAME="434"></A>down those upon whom they fell in heaps, breaking all their ranks and files. 
<A NAME="435"></A>In the meantime huge poles thrust out from the walls over the ships sunk 
<A NAME="436"></A>some by the great weights which they let down from on high upon them; others 
<A NAME="437"></A>they lifted up into the air by an iron hand or beak like a crane's beak 
<A NAME="438"></A>and, when they had drawn them up by the prow, and set them on end upon 
<A NAME="439"></A>the poop, they plunged them to the bottom of the sea; or else the ships, 
<A NAME="440"></A>drawn by engines within, and whirled about, were dashed against steep rocks 
<A NAME="441"></A>that stood jutting out under the walls, with great destruction of the soldiers 
<A NAME="442"></A>that were aboard them. A ship was frequently lifted up to a great height 
<A NAME="443"></A>in the air (a dreadful thing to behold), and was rolled to and fro, and 
<A NAME="444"></A>kept swinging, until the mariners were all thrown out, when at length it 
<A NAME="445"></A>was dashed against the rocks, or let fall. At the engine that Marcellus 
<A NAME="446"></A>brought upon the bridge of ships, which was called Sambuca, from some resemblance 
<A NAME="447"></A>it had to an instrument of music, while it was as yet approaching the wall, 
<A NAME="448"></A>there was discharged a piece of rock of ten talents weight, then a second 
<A NAME="449"></A>and a third, which, striking upon it with immense force and a noise like 
<A NAME="450"></A>thunder, broke all its foundation to pieces, shook out all its fastenings, 
<A NAME="451"></A>and completely dislodged it from the bridge. So Marcellus, doubtful what 
<A NAME="452"></A>counsel to pursue, drew off his ships to a safer distance, and sounded 
<A NAME="453"></A>a retreat to his forces on land. They then took a resolution of coming 
<A NAME="454"></A>up under the walls, if it were possible, in the night; thinking that as 
<A NAME="455"></A>Archimedes used ropes stretched at length in playing his engines, the soldiers 
<A NAME="456"></A>would now be under the shot, and the darts would, for want of sufficient 
<A NAME="457"></A>distance to throw them, fly over their heads without effect. But he, it 
<A NAME="458"></A>appeared, had long before framed for such occasions engines accommodated 
<A NAME="459"></A>to any distance, and shorter weapons; and had made numerous small openings 
<A NAME="460"></A>in the walls, through which, with engines of a shorter range, unexpected 
<A NAME="461"></A>blows were inflicted on the assailants. Thus, when they who thought to 
<A NAME="462"></A>deceive the defenders came close up to the walls, instantly a shower of 
<A NAME="463"></A>darts and other missile weapons was again cast upon them. And when stones 
<A NAME="464"></A>came tumbling down perpendicularly upon their heads, and, as it were, the 
<A NAME="465"></A>whole wall shot out arrows at them, they retired. And now, again, as they 
<A NAME="466"></A>were going off, arrows and darts of a longer range inflicted a great slaughter 
<A NAME="467"></A>among them, and their ships were driven one against another; while they 
<A NAME="468"></A>themselves were not able to retaliate in any way. For Archimedes had provided 
<A NAME="469"></A>and fixed most of his engines immediately under the wall; whence the Romans, 
<A NAME="470"></A>seeing that indefinite mischief overwhelmed them from no visible means, 
<A NAME="471"></A>began to think they were fighting with the gods.
<A NAME="472"></A><BR><BR>Yet Marcellus escaped unhurt, and deriding his own artificers and 
<A NAME="473"></A>engineers, "What," said he, "must we give up fighting with this geometrical 
<A NAME="474"></A>Briareus, who plays pitch-and-toss with our ships, and, with the multitude 
<A NAME="475"></A>of darts which he showers at a single moment upon us, really outdoes the 
<A NAME="476"></A>hundred-handed giants of mythology?" And, doubtless, the rest of the Syracusans 
<A NAME="477"></A>were but the body of Archimedes's designs, one soul moving and governing 
<A NAME="478"></A>all; for, laying aside all other arms, with this alone they infested the 
<A NAME="479"></A>Romans and protected themselves. In fine, when such terror had seized upon 
<A NAME="480"></A>the Romans, that, if they did but see a little rope or a piece of wood 
<A NAME="481"></A>from the wall, instantly crying out, that there it was again, Archimedes 
<A NAME="482"></A>was about to let fly some engine at them, they turned their backs and fled, 
<A NAME="483"></A>Marcellus desisted from conflicts and assaults, putting all his hope in 
<A NAME="484"></A>a long siege. Yet Archimedes possessed so high a spirit, so profound a 
<A NAME="485"></A>soul, and such treasures of scientific knowledge, that though these inventions 
<A NAME="486"></A>had now obtained him the renown of more than human sagacity, he yet would 
<A NAME="487"></A>not deign to leave behind him any commentary or writing on such subjects; 
<A NAME="488"></A>but, repudiating as sordid and ignoble the whole trade of engineering, 
<A NAME="489"></A>and every sort of art that lends itself to mere use and profit, he placed 
<A NAME="490"></A>his whole affection and ambition in those purer speculations where there 
<A NAME="491"></A>can be no reference to the vulgar needs of life; studies, the superiority 
<A NAME="492"></A>of which to all others is unquestioned, and in which the only doubt can 
<A NAME="493"></A>be whether the beauty and grandeur of the subjects examined, of the precision 
<A NAME="494"></A>and cogency of the methods and means of proof, most deserve our admiration. 
<A NAME="495"></A>It is not possible to find in all geometry more difficult and intricate 
<A NAME="496"></A>questions, or more simple and lucid explanations. Some ascribe this to 
<A NAME="497"></A>his natural genius; while others think that incredible effort and toil 
<A NAME="498"></A>produced these, to all appearances, easy and unlaboured results. No amount 
<A NAME="499"></A>of investigation of yours would succeed in attaining the proof, and yet, 
<A NAME="500"></A>once seen, you immediately believe you would have discovered it; by so 
<A NAME="501"></A>smooth and so rapid a path he leads you to the conclusion required. And 
<A NAME="502"></A>thus it ceases to be incredible that (as is commonly told of him) the charm 
<A NAME="503"></A>of his familiar and domestic Siren made him forget his food and neglect 
<A NAME="504"></A>his person, to that degree that when he was occasionally carried by absolute 
<A NAME="505"></A>violence to bathe or have his body anointed, he used to trace geometrical 
<A NAME="506"></A>figures in the ashes of the fire, and diagrams in the oil on his body, 
<A NAME="507"></A>being in a state of entire preoccupation, and, in the truest sense, divine 
<A NAME="508"></A>possession with his love and delight in science. His discoveries were numerous 
<A NAME="509"></A>and admirable; but he is said to have requested his friends and relations 
<A NAME="510"></A>that, when he was dead, they would place over his tomb a sphere containing 
<A NAME="511"></A>a cylinder, inscribing it with the ratio which the containing solid bears 
<A NAME="512"></A>to the contained.
<A NAME="513"></A><BR><BR>Such was Archimedes, who now showed himself, and so far as lay 
<A NAME="514"></A>in him the city also, invincible. While the siege continued, Marcellus 
<A NAME="515"></A>took Megara, one of the earliest founded of the Greek cities in Sicily, 
<A NAME="516"></A>and capturing also the camp of Hippocrates at Acilae, killed above eight 
<A NAME="517"></A>thousand men, having attacked them whilst they were engaged in forming 
<A NAME="518"></A>their fortifications. He overran a great part of Sicily; gained over many 
<A NAME="519"></A>towns from the Carthaginians, and overcame all that dared to encounter 
<A NAME="520"></A>him. As the siege went on, one Damippus, a Lacedaemonian, putting to sea 
<A NAME="521"></A>in a ship from Syracuse, was taken. When the Syracusans much desired to 
<A NAME="522"></A>redeem this man, and there were many meetings and treaties about the matter 
<A NAME="523"></A>betwixt them and Marcellus, he had opportunity to notice a tower into which 
<A NAME="524"></A>a body of men might be secretly introduced, as the wall near to it was 
<A NAME="525"></A>not difficult to surmount, and it was itself carelessly guarded. Coming 
<A NAME="526"></A>often thither, and entertaining conferences about the release of Damippus, 
<A NAME="527"></A>he had pretty well calculated the height of the tower, and got ladders 
<A NAME="528"></A>prepared. The Syracusans celebrated a feast to Diana; this juncture of 
<A NAME="529"></A>time, when they were given up entirely to wine and sport, Marcellus laid 
<A NAME="530"></A>hold of, and before the citizens perceived it, not only possessed himself 
<A NAME="531"></A>of the tower, but, before the break of day, filled the wall around with 
<A NAME="532"></A>soldiers, and made his way into the Hexapylum. The Syracusans now beginning 
<A NAME="533"></A>to stir, and to be alarmed at the tumult, he ordered the trumpets everywhere 
<A NAME="534"></A>to sound, and thus frightened them all into flight, as if all parts of 
<A NAME="535"></A>the city were already won, though the most fortified, and the fairest, 
<A NAME="536"></A>and most ample quarter was still ungained. It is called Acradina, and was 
<A NAME="537"></A>divided by a wall from the outer city, one part of which they call Neapolis, 
<A NAME="538"></A>the other Tycha. Possessing himself of these, Marcellus, about break of 
<A NAME="539"></A>day, entered through the Hexapylum, all his officers congratulating him. 
<A NAME="540"></A>But looking down from the higher places upon the beautiful and spacious 
<A NAME="541"></A>city below, he is said to have wept much, commiserating the calamity that 
<A NAME="542"></A>hung over it, when his thoughts represented to him how dismal and foul 
<A NAME="543"></A>the face of the city would be in a few hours, when plundered and sacked 
<A NAME="544"></A>by the soldiers. For among the officers of his army there was not one man 
<A NAME="545"></A>that durst deny the plunder of the city to the soldiers' demands; nay, 
<A NAME="546"></A>many were instant that it should be set on fire and laid level to the ground: 
<A NAME="547"></A>but this Marcellus would not listen to. Yet he granted, but with great 
<A NAME="548"></A>unwillingness and reluctance, that the money and slaves should be made 
<A NAME="549"></A>prey; giving orders, at the same time, that none should violate any free 
<A NAME="550"></A>person, nor kill, misuse, or make a slave of any of the Syracusans. Though 
<A NAME="551"></A>he had used this moderation, he still esteemed the condition of that city 
<A NAME="552"></A>to be pitiable, and, even amidst the congratulations and joy, showed his 
<A NAME="553"></A>strong feelings of sympathy and commiseration at seeing all the riches 
<A NAME="554"></A>accumulated during a long felicity now dissipated in an hour. For it is 
<A NAME="555"></A>related that no less prey and plunder was taken here than afterward in 
<A NAME="556"></A>Carthage. For not long after they obtained also the plunder of the other 
<A NAME="557"></A>parts of the city, which were taken by treachery; leaving nothing untouched 
<A NAME="558"></A>but the king's money, which was brought into the public treasury. But nothing 
<A NAME="559"></A>afflicted Marcellus so much as the death of Archimedes, who was then, as 
<A NAME="560"></A>fate would have it, intent upon working out some problem by a diagram, 
<A NAME="561"></A>and having fixed his mind alike and his eyes upon the subject of his speculation, 
<A NAME="562"></A>he never noticed the incursion of the Romans, nor that the city was taken. 
<A NAME="563"></A>In this transport of study and contemplation, a soldier, unexpectedly coming 
<A NAME="564"></A>up to him, commanded him to follow to Marcellus; which he declining to 
<A NAME="565"></A>do before he had worked out his problem to a demonstration, the soldier, 
<A NAME="566"></A>enraged, drew his sword and ran him through. Others write that a Roman 
<A NAME="567"></A>soldier, running upon him with a drawn sword, offered to kill him; and 
<A NAME="568"></A>that Archimedes, looking back, earnestly besought him to hold his hand 
<A NAME="569"></A>a little while, that he might not leave what he was then at work upon inconclusive 
<A NAME="570"></A>and imperfect; but the soldier, nothing moved by his entreaty, instantly 
<A NAME="571"></A>killed him. Others again relate that, as Archimedes was carrying to Marcellus 
<A NAME="572"></A>mathematical instruments, dials, spheres, and angles, by which the magnitude 
<A NAME="573"></A>of the sun might be measured to the sight, some soldiers seeing him, and 
<A NAME="574"></A>thinking that he carried gold in a vessel, slew him. Certain it is that 
<A NAME="575"></A>his death was very afflicting to Marcellus; and that Marcellus ever after 
<A NAME="576"></A>regarded him that killed him as a murderer; and that he sought for his 
<A NAME="577"></A>kindred and honoured them with signal favours.
<A NAME="578"></A><BR><BR>Indeed, foreign nations had held the Romans to be excellent soldiers 
<A NAME="579"></A>and formidable in battle; but they had hitherto given no memorable example 
<A NAME="580"></A>of gentleness, or humanity, or civil virtue; and Marcellus seems first 
<A NAME="581"></A>to have shown to the Greeks that his countrymen were most illustrious for 
<A NAME="582"></A>their justice. For such was his moderation to all with whom he had anything 
<A NAME="583"></A>to do, and such his benignity also to many cities and private men, that, 
<A NAME="584"></A>if anything hard or severe was decreed concerning the people of Enna, Megara, 
<A NAME="585"></A>or Syracuse, the blame was thought to belong rather to those upon whom 
<A NAME="586"></A>the storm fell, than to those who brought it upon them. One example of 
<A NAME="587"></A>many I will commemorate. In Sicily there is a town called Engyum, not indeed 
<A NAME="588"></A>great, but very ancient and ennobled by the presence of the goddesses, 
<A NAME="589"></A>called the Mothers. The temple, they say, was built by the Cretans; and 
<A NAME="590"></A>they show some spears and brazen helmets, inscribed with the names of Meriones, 
<A NAME="591"></A>and (with the same spelling as in Latin) of Ulysses, who consecrated them 
<A NAME="592"></A>to the goddesses. This city highly favouring the party of the Carthaginians, 
<A NAME="593"></A>Nicias, the most eminent of the citizens, counselled them to go over to 
<A NAME="594"></A>the Romans; to that end acting freely and openly in harangues to their 
<A NAME="595"></A>assemblies, arguing the imprudence and madness of the opposite course. 
<A NAME="596"></A>They, fearing his power and authority, resolved to deliver him in bonds 
<A NAME="597"></A>to the Carthaginians. Nicias, detecting the design, and seeing that his 
<A NAME="598"></A>person was secretly kept in watch, proceeded to speak irreligiously to 
<A NAME="599"></A>the vulgar of the Mothers, and showed many signs of disrespect, as if he 
<A NAME="600"></A>denied and contemned the received opinion of the presence of those goddesses; 
<A NAME="601"></A>his enemies the while rejoicing that he, of his own accord, sought the 
<A NAME="602"></A>destruction hanging over his head. When they were just now about to lay 
<A NAME="603"></A>hands upon him, an assembly was held, and here Nicias, making a speech 
<A NAME="604"></A>to the people concerning some affair then under deliberation, in the midst 
<A NAME="605"></A>of his address, cast himself upon the ground; and soon after, while amazement 
<A NAME="606"></A>(as usually happens on such surprising occasions) held the assembly immovable, 
<A NAME="607"></A>raising and turning his head round, he began in a trembling and deep tone, 
<A NAME="608"></A>but by degrees raised and sharpened his voice. When he saw the whole theatre 
<A NAME="609"></A>struck with horror and silence, throwing off his mantle and rending his 
<A NAME="610"></A>tunic he leaps up half naked, and runs towards the door, crying out aloud 
<A NAME="611"></A>that he was driven by the wrath of the Mothers. When no man durst, out 
<A NAME="612"></A>of religious fear, lay hands upon him or stop him, but all gave way before 
<A NAME="613"></A>him, he ran out of the gate, not omitting any shriek or gesture of men 
<A NAME="614"></A>possessed and mad. His wife, conscious of his counterfeiting, and privy 
<A NAME="615"></A>to his design, taking her children with her, first cast herself as a suppliant 
<A NAME="616"></A>before the temple of the goddesses; then, pretending to seek her wandering 
<A NAME="617"></A>husband, no man hindering her, went out of the town in safety; and by this 
<A NAME="618"></A>means they all escaped to Marcellus at Syracuse. After many other such 
<A NAME="619"></A>affronts offered him by the men of Engyum, Marcellus, having taken them 
<A NAME="620"></A>all prisoners and cast them into bonds, was preparing to inflict upon them 
<A NAME="621"></A>the last punishment; when Nicias, with tears in his eyes, addressed himself 
<A NAME="622"></A>to him. In fine, casting himself at Marcellus's feet, and deprecating for 
<A NAME="623"></A>his citizens, he begged most earnestly their lives, chiefly those of his 
<A NAME="624"></A>enemies. Marcellus, relenting, set them all at liberty, and rewarded Nicias 
<A NAME="625"></A>with ample lands and rich presents. This history is recorded by Posidonius 
<A NAME="626"></A>the philosopher.
<A NAME="627"></A><BR><BR>Marcellus, at length recalled by the people of Rome to the immediate 
<A NAME="628"></A>war at home, to illustrate his triumph, and adorn the city, carried away 
<A NAME="629"></A>with him a great number of the most beautiful ornaments of Syracuse. For, 
<A NAME="630"></A>before that, Rome neither had, nor had seen, any of those fine and exquisite 
<A NAME="631"></A>rarities; nor was any pleasure taken in graceful and elegant pieces of 
<A NAME="632"></A>workmanship. Stuffed with barbarous arms and spoils stained with blood, 
<A NAME="633"></A>and everywhere crowned with triumphal memorials and trophies, she was no 
<A NAME="634"></A>pleasant or delightful spectacle for the eyes of peaceful or refined spectators; 
<A NAME="635"></A>but, as Epaminondas named the fields of Boeotia the stage of Mars; and 
<A NAME="636"></A>Xenophon called Ephesus the workhouse of war; so, in my judgment, may you 
<A NAME="637"></A>call Rome, at that time (to use the words of Pindar), "the precinct of 
<A NAME="638"></A>the peaceless Mars." Whence Marcellus was more popular with the people 
<A NAME="639"></A>in general, because he had adorned the city with beautiful objects that 
<A NAME="640"></A>had all the charms of Grecian grace and symmetry; but Fabius Maximus, who 
<A NAME="641"></A>neither touched nor brought away anything of this kind from Tarentum, when 
<A NAME="642"></A>he had taken it, was more approved of by the elder men. He carried off 
<A NAME="643"></A>the money and valuables, but forbade the statues to be moved; adding, as 
<A NAME="644"></A>it is commonly related, "Let us leave to the Tarentines these offended 
<A NAME="645"></A>gods." They blamed Marcellus, first for placing the city in an invidious 
<A NAME="646"></A>position, as it seemed now to celebrate victories and lead processions 
<A NAME="647"></A>of triumph, not only over men, but also over the gods as captives; then, 
<A NAME="648"></A>that he had diverted to idleness, and vain talk about curious arts and 
<A NAME="649"></A>artificers, the common people, which, bred up in wars and agriculture, 
<A NAME="650"></A>had never tasted of luxury and sloth, and, as Euripides said of Hercules, 
<A NAME="651"></A>had been-
<A NAME="652"></A><BR><BR>"Rude, unrefined, only for great things good," so that now they 
<A NAME="653"></A>misspent much of their time in examining and criticizing trifles. And yet, 
<A NAME="654"></A>notwithstanding this reprimand, Marcellus made it his glory to the Greeks 
<A NAME="655"></A>themselves, that he had taught his ignorant countrymen to esteem and admire 
<A NAME="656"></A>the elegant and wonderful productions of Greece.
<A NAME="657"></A><BR><BR>But when the envious opposed his being brought triumphant into 
<A NAME="658"></A>the city, because there were some relics of the war in Sicily, and a third 
<A NAME="659"></A>triumph would be looked upon with jealousy, he gave way. He triumphed upon 
<A NAME="660"></A>the Alban mount, and thence entered the city in ovation, as it is called 
<A NAME="661"></A>in Latin, in Greek eua; but in this ovation he was neither carried in a 
<A NAME="662"></A>chariot, nor crowned with laurel, nor ushered by trumpets sounding; but 
<A NAME="663"></A>went afoot with shoes on, many flutes or pipes sounding in concert, while 
<A NAME="664"></A>he passed along, wearing a garland of myrtle, in a peaceable aspect, exciting 
<A NAME="665"></A>rather love and respect than fear. Whence I am, by conjecture, led to think 
<A NAME="666"></A>that, originally, the difference observed betwixt ovation and triumph did 
<A NAME="667"></A>not depend upon the greatness of the achievements, but the manner of performing 
<A NAME="668"></A>them. For they who, having fought a set battle, and slain the enemy, returned 
<A NAME="669"></A>victors, led that martial, terrible triumph, and, as the ordinary custom 
<A NAME="670"></A>then was in lustrating the army, adorned the arms and the soldiers with 
<A NAME="671"></A>a great deal of laurel. But they who without force, by colloquy, persuasion, 
<A NAME="672"></A>and reasoning, had done the business, to these captains custom gave the 
<A NAME="673"></A>honour of the unmilitary and festive ovation. For the pipe is the badge 
<A NAME="674"></A>of peace, and myrtle the plant of Venus, who more than the rest of the 
<A NAME="675"></A>gods and goddesses abhors force and war. It is called ovation, not as most 
<A NAME="676"></A>think, from the Greek euasmus, because they act it with shouting and cries 
<A NAME="677"></A>of Eua: for so do they also the proper triumphs. The Greeks have wrested 
<A NAME="678"></A>the word to their own language, thinking that this honour, also, must have 
<A NAME="679"></A>some connection with Bacchus, who in Greek has the titles of Euius and 
<A NAME="680"></A>Thriambus. But the thing is otherwise. For it was the custom for commanders, 
<A NAME="681"></A>in their triumph, to immolate an ox, but in their ovation, a sheep: hence 
<A NAME="682"></A>they named it Ovation, from the Latin ovis. It is worth observing, how 
<A NAME="683"></A>exactly opposite the sacrifices appointed by the Spartan legislator are 
<A NAME="684"></A>to those of the Romans. For at Lacedaemon, a captain, who had performed 
<A NAME="685"></A>the work he had undertook by cunning, or courteous treaty, on laying down 
<A NAME="686"></A>his command, immolated an ox; he that did the business by battle, offered 
<A NAME="687"></A>a cock; the Lacedaemonians, though most warlike, thinking exploit performed 
<A NAME="688"></A>by reason and wisdom to be more excellent and more congruous to man, than 
<A NAME="689"></A>one effected by mere force and courage. Which of the two is to be preferred 
<A NAME="690"></A>I leave to the determination of others.
<A NAME="691"></A><BR><BR>Marcellus being the fourth time consul, his enemies suborned the 
<A NAME="692"></A>Syracusans to come to Rome to accuse him, and to complain that they had 
<A NAME="693"></A>suffered indignities and wrongs, contrary to the conditions granted them. 
<A NAME="694"></A>It happened that Marcellus was in the capitol offering sacrifice when the 
<A NAME="695"></A>Syracusans petitioned the senate, yet sitting, that they might have leave 
<A NAME="696"></A>to accuse him and present their grievances. Marcellus's colleague, eager 
<A NAME="697"></A>to protect him in his absence, put them out of the court. But Marcellus 
<A NAME="698"></A>himself came as soon as he heard of it. And first, in his curule chair 
<A NAME="699"></A>as consul, he referred to the senate the cognizance of other matters: but 
<A NAME="700"></A>when these were transacted, rising from his seat, he passed as a private 
<A NAME="701"></A>man into the place where the accused were wont to make their defence, and 
<A NAME="702"></A>gave free liberty to the Syracusans to impeach him. But they, struck with 
<A NAME="703"></A>consternation by his majesty and confidence, stood astonished; and the 
<A NAME="704"></A>power of his presence now, in his robe of state, appeared far more terrible 
<A NAME="705"></A>and severe than it had done when he was arrayed in armour. Yet, reanimated 
<A NAME="706"></A>at length by Marcellus's rivals, they began their impeachment, and made 
<A NAME="707"></A>an oration in which pleas of justice mingled with lamentation and complaint; 
<A NAME="708"></A>the sum of which was, that being allies and friends of the people of Rome, 
<A NAME="709"></A>they had, notwithstanding, suffered things which other commanders had abstained 
<A NAME="710"></A>from inflicting upon enemies. To this Marcellus answered that they had 
<A NAME="711"></A>committed many acts of hostility against the people of Rome, and had suffered 
<A NAME="712"></A>nothing but what enemies conquered and captured in war cannot possibly 
<A NAME="713"></A>be protected from suffering: that it was their own fault they had been 
<A NAME="714"></A>made captives, because they refused to give ear to his frequent attempts 
<A NAME="715"></A>to persuade them by gentle means: neither were they forced into war by 
<A NAME="716"></A>the power of tyrants, but had rather chosen the tyrants themselves for 
<A NAME="717"></A>the express object that they might make war. The orations ended, and the 
<A NAME="718"></A>Syracusans, according to the custom, having retired, Marcellus left his 
<A NAME="719"></A>colleague to ask the sentences, and, withdrawing with the Syracusans, stayed 
<A NAME="720"></A>expecting at the doors of the senate-house; not in the least discomposed 
<A NAME="721"></A>in spirit, either with alarm at the accusation, or by anger against the 
<A NAME="722"></A>Syracusans; but with perfect calmness and serenity attending the issue 
<A NAME="723"></A>of the cause. The sentences at length being all asked, and a decree of 
<A NAME="724"></A>the senate made in vindication of Marcellus, the Syracusans, with tears 
<A NAME="725"></A>flowing from their eyes, cast themselves at his knees, beseeching him to 
<A NAME="726"></A>forgive themselves there present, and to be moved by the misery of the 
<A NAME="727"></A>rest of their city, which would ever be mindful of, and grateful for, his 
<A NAME="728"></A>benefits. Thus Marcellus, softened by their tears and distress, was not 
<A NAME="729"></A>only reconciled to the deputies, but ever afterwards continued to find 
<A NAME="730"></A>opportunity of doing kindness to the Syracusans. The liberty which he had 
<A NAME="731"></A>restored to them, and their rights, laws, and goods that were left, the 
<A NAME="732"></A>senate confirmed. Upon which account the Syracusans, besides other signal 
<A NAME="733"></A>honours, made a law, that if Marcellus should at any time come into Sicily, 
<A NAME="734"></A>or any of his posterity, the Syracusans should wear garlands and offer 
<A NAME="735"></A>public sacrifice to the gods.
<A NAME="736"></A><BR><BR>After this he moved against Hannibal. And whereas the other consuls 
<A NAME="737"></A>and commanders, since the defeat received at Cannae, had all made use of 
<A NAME="738"></A>the same policy against Hannibal, namely, to decline coming to a battle 
<A NAME="739"></A>with him; and none had had the courage to encounter him in the field and 
<A NAME="740"></A>put themselves to the decision by the sword; Marcellus entered upon the 
<A NAME="741"></A>opposite course, thinking that Italy would be destroyed by the very delay 
<A NAME="742"></A>by which they looked to wear out Hannibal; and that Fabius, who, adhering 
<A NAME="743"></A>to his cautious policy, waited to see the war extinguished, while Rome 
<A NAME="744"></A>itself meantime wasted away (like timid physicians, who, dreading to administer 
<A NAME="745"></A>remedies, stay waiting, and believe that what is the decay of the patient's 
<A NAME="746"></A>strength is the decline of the disease), was not taking a right course 
<A NAME="747"></A>to heal the sickness of his country. And first, the great cities of the 
<A NAME="748"></A>Samnites, which had revolted, came into his power; in which he found a 
<A NAME="749"></A>large quantity of corn and money, and three thousand of Hannibal's soldiers, 
<A NAME="750"></A>that were left for the defence. After this, the proconsul Cnaeus Fulvius 
<A NAME="751"></A>with eleven tribunes of the soldiers being slain in Apulia, and the greatest 
<A NAME="752"></A>part of the army also at the same time cut off, he despatched letters to 
<A NAME="753"></A>Rome, and bade the people be of good courage, for that he was now upon 
<A NAME="754"></A>the march against Hannibal, to turn his triumph into sadness. On these 
<A NAME="755"></A>letters being read, Livy writes that the people were not only not encouraged, 
<A NAME="756"></A>but more discouraged than before. For danger, they thought, was but the 
<A NAME="757"></A>greater in proportion as Marcellus was of more value than Fulvius. He, 
<A NAME="758"></A>as he had written, advancing into the territories of the Lucanians, came 
<A NAME="759"></A>up to him at Numistro, and, the enemy keeping himself upon the hills, pitched 
<A NAME="760"></A>his camp in a level plain, and the next day drew forth his army in order 
<A NAME="761"></A>for fight. Nor did Hannibal refuse the challenge. They fought long and 
<A NAME="762"></A>obstinately on both sides, victory yet seeming undecided, when, after three 
<A NAME="763"></A>hours' conflict, night hardly parted them. The next day, as soon as the 
<A NAME="764"></A>sun was risen, Marcellus again brought forth his troops, and ranged them 
<A NAME="765"></A>among the dead bodies of the slain, challenging Hannibal to solve the question 
<A NAME="766"></A>by another trial. When he dislodged and drew off, Marcellus, gathering 
<A NAME="767"></A>up the spoils of the enemies, and burying the bodies of his slain soldiers, 
<A NAME="768"></A>closely followed him. And though Hannibal often used stratagems, and laid 
<A NAME="769"></A>ambushes to entrap Marcellus, yet he never could circumvent him. By skirmishes, 
<A NAME="770"></A>meantime, in all of which he was superior, Marcellus gained himself such 
<A NAME="771"></A>high repute, that, when the time of the Comitia at Rome was near at hand, 
<A NAME="772"></A>the senate thought fit rather to recall the other consul from Sicily than 
<A NAME="773"></A>to withdraw Marcellus from his conflict with Hannibal; and on his arrival 
<A NAME="774"></A>they bid him name Quintus Fulvius dictator. For the dictator is created 
<A NAME="775"></A>neither by the people nor by the senate, but the consul of the praetor, 
<A NAME="776"></A>before the popular assembly, pronounces him to be dictator whom he himself 
<A NAME="777"></A>chooses. Hence he is called dictator, dicere meaning to name. Others say 
<A NAME="778"></A>that he is named dictator because his word is a law, and he orders what 
<A NAME="779"></A>he pleases, without submitting it to the vote. For the Romans call the 
<A NAME="780"></A>orders of magistrates Edicts.
<A NAME="781"></A><BR><BR>And now because Marcellus's colleague, who was recalled from Sicily, 
<A NAME="782"></A>had a mind to name another man dictator, and would not be forced to change 
<A NAME="783"></A>his opinion, he sailed away by night back to Sicily. So the common people 
<A NAME="784"></A>made an order that Quintus Fulvius should be chosen dictator: and the senate, 
<A NAME="785"></A>by an express, commanded Marcellus to nominate him. He obeying proclaimed 
<A NAME="786"></A>him dictator according to the order of the people; but the office of proconsul 
<A NAME="787"></A>was continued to himself for a year. And having arranged with Fabius Maximus 
<A NAME="788"></A>that, while he besieged Tarentum, he would, by following Hannibal and drawing 
<A NAME="789"></A>him up and down, detain him from coming to the relief of the Tarentines, 
<A NAME="790"></A>he overtook him at Canusium: and as Hannibal often shifted his camp, and 
<A NAME="791"></A>still declined the combat, he everywhere sought to engage him. At last, 
<A NAME="792"></A>pressing upon him while encamping, by light skirmishes he provoked him 
<A NAME="793"></A>to a battle; but night again divided them in the very heat of the conflict. 
<A NAME="794"></A>The next day Marcellus again showed himself in arms, and brought up his 
<A NAME="795"></A>forces in array. Hannibal, in extreme grief, called his Carthaginians together 
<A NAME="796"></A>to an harangue: and vehemently prayed them to fight to-day worthily of 
<A NAME="797"></A>all their former success; "For you see," said he, "how, after such great 
<A NAME="798"></A>victories, we have not liberty to respire, nor to repose ourselves, though 
<A NAME="799"></A>victors; unless we drive this man back." Then the two armies, joining battle, 
<A NAME="800"></A>fought fiercely; when the event of an untimely movement showed Marcellus 
<A NAME="801"></A>to have been guilty of an error. The right wing being hard pressed upon, 
<A NAME="802"></A>he commanded one of the legions to be brought up to the front. This change 
<A NAME="803"></A>disturbing the array and posture of the legions gave the victory to the 
<A NAME="804"></A>enemies; and there fell two thousand seven hundred Romans. Marcellus, after 
<A NAME="805"></A>he had retreated into his camp, called his soldiers together. "I see," 
<A NAME="806"></A>said he, "many Roman arms and bodies, but I see not so much as one Roman." 
<A NAME="807"></A>To their entreaties for his pardon, he returned a refusal while they remained 
<A NAME="808"></A>beaten, but promised to give it so soon as they should overcome; and he 
<A NAME="809"></A>resolved to bring them into the field again the next day, that the fame 
<A NAME="810"></A>of their victory might arrive at Rome before that of their flight. Dismissing 
<A NAME="811"></A>the assembly, he commanded barley instead of wheat to be given to those 
<A NAME="812"></A>companies that had turned their backs. These rebukes were so bitter to 
<A NAME="813"></A>the soldiers, that though a great number of them were grievously wounded, 
<A NAME="814"></A>yet they relate there was not one to whom the general's oration was not 
<A NAME="815"></A>more painful and smarting than his wounds.
<A NAME="816"></A><BR><BR>The day breaking, a scarlet toga, the sign of instant battle, was 
<A NAME="817"></A>displayed. The companies marked with ignominy begged they might be posted 
<A NAME="818"></A>in the foremost place, and obtained their request. Then the tribunes bring 
<A NAME="819"></A>forth the rest of the forces, and draw them up. On news of which, "O strange!" 
<A NAME="820"></A>said Hannibal, "what will you do with this man, who can bear neither good 
<A NAME="821"></A>nor bad fortune? He is the only man who neither suffers us to rest when 
<A NAME="822"></A>he is victor, nor rests himself when he is overcome. We shall have, it 
<A NAME="823"></A>seems, perpetually to fight with him; as in good success his confidence, 
<A NAME="824"></A>and in ill success his shame, still urges him to some further enterprise." 
<A NAME="825"></A>Then the armies engaged. When the fight was doubtful, Hannibal commanded 
<A NAME="826"></A>the elephants to be brought into the first battalion, and to be driven 
<A NAME="827"></A>upon the van of the Romans. When the beasts, trampling upon many, soon 
<A NAME="828"></A>caused disorder, Flavius, a tribune of soldiers, snatching an ensign, meets 
<A NAME="829"></A>them, and wounding the first elephant with the spike at the bottom of the 
<A NAME="830"></A>ensign staff, puts him to flight. The beast turned around upon the next, 
<A NAME="831"></A>and drove back both him and the rest that followed. Marcellus, seeing this, 
<A NAME="832"></A>pours in his horse with great force upon the elephants, and upon the enemy 
<A NAME="833"></A>disordered by their flight. The horse, making a fierce impression, pursued 
<A NAME="834"></A>the Carthaginians home to their camp, while the elephants, wounded and 
<A NAME="835"></A>running upon their own party, caused a considerable slaughter. It is said 
<A NAME="836"></A>more than eight thousand were slain; of the Roman army three thousand, 
<A NAME="837"></A>and almost all wounded. This gave Hannibal opportunity to retire in the 
<A NAME="838"></A>silence of the night, and to remove to greater distance from Marcellus; 
<A NAME="839"></A>who was kept from pursuing by the number of his wounded men, and removed, 
<A NAME="840"></A>by gentle marches, into Campania, and spent the summer at Sinuessa, engaged 
<A NAME="841"></A>in restoring them.
<A NAME="842"></A><BR><BR>But as Hannibal, having disentangled himself from Marcellus, ranged 
<A NAME="843"></A>with his army round about the country, and wasted Italy free from all fear, 
<A NAME="844"></A>at Rome Marcellus was evil spoken of. His detractors induced Publicius 
<A NAME="845"></A>Bibulus, tribune of the people, an eloquent and violent man, to undertake 
<A NAME="846"></A>his accusation. He, by assiduous harangues, prevailed upon the people to 
<A NAME="847"></A>withdraw from Marcellus the command of the army; "Seeing that Marcellus," 
<A NAME="848"></A>said he, "after brief exercise in the war, has withdrawn as it might be 
<A NAME="849"></A>from the wrestling ground to the warm baths to refresh himself." Marcellus, 
<A NAME="850"></A>on hearing this, appointed lieutenants over his camp and hasted to Rome 
<A NAME="851"></A>to refute the charges against him: and there found ready drawn up an impeachment 
<A NAME="852"></A>consisting of these calumnies. At the day prefixed, in the Flaminian circus, 
<A NAME="853"></A>into which place the people had assembled themselves, Bibulus rose and 
<A NAME="854"></A>accused him. Marcellus himself answered, briefly and simply, but the first 
<A NAME="855"></A>and most approved men of the city spoke largely and in high terms, very 
<A NAME="856"></A>freely advising the people not to show themselves worse judges than the 
<A NAME="857"></A>enemy, condemning Marcellus of timidity, from whom alone of all their captains 
<A NAME="858"></A>the enemy fled, and as perpetually endeavoured to avoid fighting with him 
<A NAME="859"></A>as to fight with others. When they made an end of speaking, the accuser's 
<A NAME="860"></A>hope to obtain judgment so far deceived him, that Marcellus was not only 
<A NAME="861"></A>absolved, but the fifth time created consul.
<A NAME="862"></A><BR><BR>No sooner had he entered upon this consulate, but he suppressed 
<A NAME="863"></A>a great commotion in Etruria, that had proceeded near to revolt, and visited 
<A NAME="864"></A>and quieted the cities. Then, when the dedication of the temple, which 
<A NAME="865"></A>he had vowed out of his Sicilian spoils to Honour and Virtue, was objected 
<A NAME="866"></A>to by the priests, because they denied that one temple could be lawfully 
<A NAME="867"></A>dedicated to two gods, he began to adjoin another to it, resenting the 
<A NAME="868"></A>priests' opposition, and almost converting the thing into an omen. And, 
<A NAME="869"></A>truly, many other prodigies also affrighted him; some temples had been 
<A NAME="870"></A>struck with lightning, and in Jupiter's temple mice had gnawed the gold: 
<A NAME="871"></A>it was reported, also, that an ox had spoken, and that a boy had been born 
<A NAME="872"></A>with a head like an elephant's. All which prodigies had indeed been attended 
<A NAME="873"></A>to, but due reconciliation had not been obtained from the gods. The aruspices 
<A NAME="874"></A>therefore detained him at Rome, glowing and burning with desire to return 
<A NAME="875"></A>to the war. For no man was ever inflamed with so great desire of anything 
<A NAME="876"></A>as was he to fight a battle with Hannibal. It was the subject of his dreams 
<A NAME="877"></A>in the night, the topic of all his consultations with his friends and familiars, 
<A NAME="878"></A>nor did he present to the gods any other wish, but that he might meet Hannibal 
<A NAME="879"></A>in the field. And I think that he would most gladly have set upon him, 
<A NAME="880"></A>with both armies environed within a single camp. Had he not been even loaded 
<A NAME="881"></A>with honours, and had he not given proofs in many ways of his maturity 
<A NAME="882"></A>of judgment and of prudence equal to that of any commander, you might have 
<A NAME="883"></A>said that he was agitated by a youthful ambition, above what became a man 
<A NAME="884"></A>of that age, for he had passed the sixtieth year of his life when he began 
<A NAME="885"></A>his fifth consulship.
<A NAME="886"></A><BR><BR>The sacrifices having been offered, and all that belonged to the 
<A NAME="887"></A>propitiation of the gods performed, according to the prescription of the 
<A NAME="888"></A>diviners, he at last with his colleague went forth to carry on the war. 
<A NAME="889"></A>He tried all possible means to provoke Hannibal, who at that time had a 
<A NAME="890"></A>standing camp betwixt Bantia and Venusia. Hannibal declined an engagement, 
<A NAME="891"></A>but having obtained intelligence that some troops were on their way to 
<A NAME="892"></A>the town of Locri Epizephyrii, placing an ambush under the little hill 
<A NAME="893"></A>of Petelia, he slew two thousand five hundred soldiers. This incensed Marcellus 
<A NAME="894"></A>to revenge; and he therefore moved nearer Hannibal. Betwixt the two camps 
<A NAME="895"></A>was a little hill, a tolerably secure post, covered with wood; it had steep 
<A NAME="896"></A>descents on either side, and there were springs of water seen trickling 
<A NAME="897"></A>down. This place was so fit and advantageous that the Romans wondered that 
<A NAME="898"></A>Hannibal, who had come thither before them, had not seized upon it, but 
<A NAME="899"></A>had left it to the enemies. But to him the place had seemed commodious 
<A NAME="900"></A>indeed for a camp, but yet more commodious for an ambuscade; and to that 
<A NAME="901"></A>use he chose to put it. So in the wood and the hollows he hid a number 
<A NAME="902"></A>of archers and spearmen, confident that the commodiousness of the place 
<A NAME="903"></A>would allure the Romans. Nor was he deceived in his expectation. For presently 
<A NAME="904"></A>in the Roman camp they talked and disputed, as if they had all been captains, 
<A NAME="905"></A>how the place ought to be seized, and what great advantage they should 
<A NAME="906"></A>thereby gain upon the enemies, chiefly if they transferred their camp thither, 
<A NAME="907"></A>at any rate, if they strengthened the place with a fort. Marcellus resolved 
<A NAME="908"></A>to go, with a few horse, to view it. Having called a diviner he proceeded 
<A NAME="909"></A>to sacrifice. In the first victim the aruspex showed him the liver without 
<A NAME="910"></A>a head; in the second the head appeared of unusual size, and all the other 
<A NAME="911"></A>indications highly promising. When these seemed sufficient to free them 
<A NAME="912"></A>from the dread of the former, the diviners declared that they were all 
<A NAME="913"></A>the more terrified by the latter; because entrails too fair and promising, 
<A NAME="914"></A>when they appear after others that are maimed and monstrous, render the 
<A NAME="915"></A>change doubtful and suspicious. But-
<A NAME="916"></A><BR><BR>"Nor fire nor brazen wall can keep out fate;" as Pindar observes. 
<A NAME="917"></A>Marcellus, therefore, taking with him his colleague Crispinus, and his 
<A NAME="918"></A>son, a tribune of soldiers, with two hundred and twenty horse at most (among 
<A NAME="919"></A>whom there was not one Roman, but all were Etruscans, except forty Fregellans, 
<A NAME="920"></A>of whose courage and fidelity he had on all occasions received full proof), 
<A NAME="921"></A>goes to view the place. The hill was covered with woods all over; on the 
<A NAME="922"></A>top of it sat a scout concealed from the sight of the enemy, but having 
<A NAME="923"></A>the Roman camp exposed to his view. Upon signs received from him, the men 
<A NAME="924"></A>that were placed in ambush stirred not till Marcellus came near; and then 
<A NAME="925"></A>all starting up in an instant, and encompassing him from all sides, attacked 
<A NAME="926"></A>him with darts, struck about and wounded the backs of those that fled, 
<A NAME="927"></A>and pressed upon those who resisted. These were the forty Fregellans. For 
<A NAME="928"></A>though the Etruscans fled in the very beginning of the fight, the Fregellans 
<A NAME="929"></A>formed themselves into a ring, bravely defending the consuls, till Crispinus, 
<A NAME="930"></A>struck with two darts, turned his horse to fly away; and Marcellus's side 
<A NAME="931"></A>was run through with a lance with a broad head. Then the Fregellans, also, 
<A NAME="932"></A>the few that remained alive, leaving the fallen consul, and rescuing young 
<A NAME="933"></A>Marcellus, who also was wounded, got into the camp by flight. There were 
<A NAME="934"></A>slain not much above forty; five lictors and eighteen horsemen came alive 
<A NAME="935"></A>into the enemy's hands. Crispinus also died of his wounds a few days after. 
<A NAME="936"></A>Such a disaster as the loss of both consuls in a single engagement was 
<A NAME="937"></A>one that had never before befallen the Romans.
<A NAME="938"></A><BR><BR>Hannibal, little valuing the other events, as soon as he was told 
<A NAME="939"></A>of Marcellus's death, immediately hasted to the hill. Viewing the body, 
<A NAME="940"></A>and continuing for some time to observe its strength and shape, he allowed 
<A NAME="941"></A>not a word to fall from him expressive of the least pride or arrogancy, 
<A NAME="942"></A>nor did he show in his countenance any sign of gladness, as another perhaps 
<A NAME="943"></A>would have done, when his fierce and troublesome enemy had been taken away; 
<A NAME="944"></A>but amazed by so sudden and unexpected an end, taking off nothing but his 
<A NAME="945"></A>ring, gave order to have the body properly clad and adorned and honourably 
<A NAME="946"></A>burned. The relics put into a silver urn, with a crown of gold to cover 
<A NAME="947"></A>it, he sent back to his son. But some of the Numidians, setting upon these 
<A NAME="948"></A>that were carrying the urn, took it from them by force, and cast away the 
<A NAME="949"></A>bones; which being told to Hannibal, "It is impossible, it seems then," 
<A NAME="950"></A>he said, "to do anything against the will of God!" He punished the Numidians; 
<A NAME="951"></A>but took no further care of sending or re-collecting the bones; conceiving 
<A NAME="952"></A>that Marcellus so fell, and so lay unburied, by a certain fate. So Cornelius 
<A NAME="953"></A>Nepos and Vaerius Maximus have left upon record: but Livy and Augustus 
<A NAME="954"></A>Caesar affirm that the urn was brought to his son, and honoured with a 
<A NAME="955"></A>magnificent funeral. Besides the monuments raised for him at Rome, there 
<A NAME="956"></A>was dedicated to his memory at Catana, in Sicily, an ample wrestling place 
<A NAME="957"></A>called after him; statues and pictures, out of those he took from Syracuse, 
<A NAME="958"></A>were set up in Samothrace, in the temple of the gods, named Cabiri, and 
<A NAME="959"></A>in that of Minerva at Lindus, where also there was a statue of him, says 
<A NAME="960"></A>Posidonius, with the following inscription:-
<A NAME="961"></A><BR><BR>"This was, O stranger, once Rome's star divine,
<A NAME="962"></A><BR>Claudius Marcellus of an ancient line;
<A NAME="963"></A><BR>To fight her wars seven times her consul made,
<A NAME="964"></A><BR>Low in the dust her enemies he laid." The writer of the inscription 
<A NAME="965"></A>has added to Marcellus's five consulates his two proconsulates. His progeny 
<A NAME="966"></A>continued in high honour even down to Marcellus, son of Octavia, sister 
<A NAME="967"></A>of Augustus, whom she bore to her husband Caius Marcellus; and who died 
<A NAME="968"></A>a bridegroom, in the year of his Aedileship, having not long before married 
<A NAME="969"></A>Caesar's daughter. His mother, Octavia, dedicated the library to his honour 
<A NAME="970"></A>and memory, and Caesar the theatre which bears his name.
