<BR>(died 86 B.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>We are altogether ignorant of any third name of Caius Marius; as also of 
<A NAME="11"></A>Quintus Sertorius, that possessed himself of Spain or of Lucius Mummius 
<A NAME="12"></A>that destroyed Corinth, though this last was surnamed Achaicus from his 
<A NAME="13"></A>conquests, as Scipio was called Africanus, and Metellus, Macedonicus. Hence 
<A NAME="14"></A>Posidonius draws his chief argument to confute those that hold the third 
<A NAME="15"></A>to be the Roman proper name, as Camillus, Marcellus, Cato; as in this case, 
<A NAME="16"></A>those that had but two names would have no proper name at all. He did not, 
<A NAME="17"></A>however, observe that by his own reasoning he must rob the women absolutely 
<A NAME="18"></A>of their names; for none of them have the first, which Posidonius imagines 
<A NAME="19"></A>the proper name with the Romans. Of the other two, one was common to the 
<A NAME="20"></A>whole family, Pompeii, Manlii, Cornelii (as with us Greeks, the Heraclidae, 
<A NAME="21"></A>and Pelopidae), the other titular, and personal, taken either from their 
<A NAME="22"></A>natures, or actions, or bodily characteristics, as Macrinus, Torquatus, 
<A NAME="23"></A>Sylla; such as are Mnemon, Grypus, or Callinicus among the Greeks. On the 
<A NAME="24"></A>subject of names, however, the irregularity of custom, would we insist 
<A NAME="25"></A>upon it, might furnish us with discourse enough.
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR>There is a likeness of Marius in stone at Ravenna, in Gaul, which 
<A NAME="27"></A>I myself saw quite corresponding with that roughness of character that 
<A NAME="28"></A>is ascribed to him. Being naturally valiant and warlike, and more acquainted 
<A NAME="29"></A>also with the discipline of the camp than of the city, he could not moderate 
<A NAME="30"></A>his passion when in authority. He is said never to have either studied 
<A NAME="31"></A>Greek, or to have use of that language in any matter of consequence; thinking 
<A NAME="32"></A>it ridiculous to bestow time in that learning, the teachers of which were 
<A NAME="33"></A>little better than slaves. So after his second triumph, when at the dedication 
<A NAME="34"></A>of a temple he presented some shows after the Greek fashion, coming into 
<A NAME="35"></A>the theatre, he only sat down and immediately departed. And, accordingly, 
<A NAME="36"></A>as Plato used to say to Xenocrates the philosopher, who was thought to 
<A NAME="37"></A>show more than ordinary harshness of disposition, "I pray you, good Xenocrates, 
<A NAME="38"></A>sacrifice to the Graces;" so if any could have persuaded Marius to pay 
<A NAME="39"></A>his devotions to the Greek Muses and Graces, he had never brought his incomparable 
<A NAME="40"></A>actions, both in war and peace, to so unworthy a conclusion, or wrecked 
<A NAME="41"></A>himself, so to say, upon an old age of cruelty and vindictiveness, through 
<A NAME="42"></A>passion, ill-timed ambition, and insatiable cupidity. But this will further 
<A NAME="43"></A>appear by and by from the facts.
<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR>He was born of parents altogether obscure and indigent, who supported 
<A NAME="45"></A>themselves by their daily labour; his father of the same name with himself, 
<A NAME="46"></A>his mother called Fulcinia. He had spent a considerable part of his life 
<A NAME="47"></A>before he saw and tasted the pleasures of the city; having passed previously 
<A NAME="48"></A>in Cirrhaeaton, a village of the territory of Arpinum, a life, compared 
<A NAME="49"></A>with city delicacies, rude and unrefined, yet temperate, and conformable 
<A NAME="50"></A>to the ancient Roman severity. He first served as a soldier in the war 
<A NAME="51"></A>against the Celtiberians, when Scipio Africanus besieged Numantia; where 
<A NAME="52"></A>he signalized himself to his general by courage far above his comrades, 
<A NAME="53"></A>and particularly by his cheerfully complying with Scipio's reformation 
<A NAME="54"></A>of his army, being almost ruined by pleasures and luxury. It is stated, 
<A NAME="55"></A>too, that he encountered and vanquished an enemy in single combat, in his 
<A NAME="56"></A>general's sight. In consequence of all this he had several honours conferred 
<A NAME="57"></A>upon him; and once when at an entertainment a question arose about commanders, 
<A NAME="58"></A>and one of the company (whether really desirous to know, or only in complaisance) 
<A NAME="59"></A>asked Scipio where the Romans, after him, should obtain such another general, 
<A NAME="60"></A>Scipio, gently clapping Marius on the shoulder as he sat next him, replied, 
<A NAME="61"></A>"Here, perhaps." So promising was his early youth of his future greatness, 
<A NAME="62"></A>and so discerning was Scipio to detect the distant future in the present 
<A NAME="63"></A>first beginnings. It was this speech of Scipio, we are told, which, like 
<A NAME="64"></A>a divine admonition, chiefly emboldened Marius to aspire to a political 
<A NAME="65"></A>career. He sought, and by the assistance of Caecilius Metellus, of whose 
<A NAME="66"></A>family he as well as his father were dependents, obtained the office of 
<A NAME="67"></A>tribune of the people. In which place, when he brought forward a bill for 
<A NAME="68"></A>the regulation of voting, which seemed likely to lessen the authority of 
<A NAME="69"></A>the great men in the courts of justice, the consul Cotta opposed him, and 
<A NAME="70"></A>persuaded the senate to declare against the law, and called Marius to account 
<A NAME="71"></A>for it. He, however, when this decree was prepared, coming into the senate, 
<A NAME="72"></A>did not behave like a young man newly and undeservedly advanced to authority, 
<A NAME="73"></A>but, assuming all the courage that his future actions would have warranted, 
<A NAME="74"></A>threatened Cotta, unless he recalled the decree, to throw him into prison. 
<A NAME="75"></A>And on his turning to Metellus, and asking his vote, and Metellus, rising 
<A NAME="76"></A>up to concur with the consul, Marius, calling for the officer outside, 
<A NAME="77"></A>commanded him to take Metellus into custody. He appealed to the other tribunes, 
<A NAME="78"></A>but not one of them assisted him; so that the senate, immediately complying, 
<A NAME="79"></A>withdrew the decree. Marius came forth with glory to the people and confirmed 
<A NAME="80"></A>his law, and was henceforth esteemed a man of undaunted courage and assurance, 
<A NAME="81"></A>as well as a vigorous opposer of the senate in favour of the commons. But 
<A NAME="82"></A>he immediately lost their opinion of him by a contrary action; for when 
<A NAME="83"></A>a law for the distribution of corn was proposed, he vigorously and successfully 
<A NAME="84"></A>resisted it, making himself equally honoured by both parties, in gratifying 
<A NAME="85"></A>neither, contrary to the public interest.
<A NAME="86"></A><BR><BR>After his tribuneship, he was candidate for the office of chief 
<A NAME="87"></A>aedile; there being two orders of them, one the curules, from the stool 
<A NAME="88"></A>with crooked feet on which they sat when they performed their duty; the 
<A NAME="89"></A>other and inferior, called aediles of the people. As soon as they have 
<A NAME="90"></A>chosen the former, they give their voices again for the latter. Marius, 
<A NAME="91"></A>finding he was likely to be put by for the greater, immediately changed 
<A NAME="92"></A>and stood for the less; but because he seemed too forward and hot, he was 
<A NAME="93"></A>disappointed of that also. And yet though he was in one day twice frustrated 
<A NAME="94"></A>of his desired preferment (which never happened to any before), yet he 
<A NAME="95"></A>was not at all discouraged, but a little while after sought for the praetorship 
<A NAME="96"></A>and was nearly suffering a repulse, and then, too, though he was returned 
<A NAME="97"></A>last of all, was nevertheless accused of bribery.
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR>Cassius Sabaco's servant, who was observed within the rails among 
<A NAME="99"></A>those who voted, chiefly occasioned the suspicion, as Sabaco was an intimate 
<A NAME="100"></A>friend of Marius; but on being called to appear before the judges, he alleged, 
<A NAME="101"></A>that being thirsty by reason of the heat, he called for cold water, and 
<A NAME="102"></A>that his servant brought him a cup, and as soon as he had drunk, departed; 
<A NAME="103"></A>he was, however, excluded from the senate by the succeeding censors, and 
<A NAME="104"></A>not undeservedly either, as was thought, whether it might be for his false 
<A NAME="105"></A>evidence, or his want of temperance. Caius Herennius was also cited to 
<A NAME="106"></A>appear as evidence, but pleaded that it was not customary for a patron 
<A NAME="107"></A>(the Roman word for protector) to witness against his clients, and that 
<A NAME="108"></A>the law excused them from that harsh duty; and both Marius and his parents 
<A NAME="109"></A>had always been clients to the family of Herennii. And when the judges 
<A NAME="110"></A>would have accepted of this plea, Marius himself opposed it, and told Herennius, 
<A NAME="111"></A>that when he was first created magistrate he ceased to be his client; which 
<A NAME="112"></A>was not altogether true. For it is not every office that frees clients 
<A NAME="113"></A>and their posterity from the observance due to their patrons, but only 
<A NAME="114"></A>those to which the law has assigned a curule chair. Notwithstanding, though 
<A NAME="115"></A>at the beginning of the suit it went somewhat hard with Marius, and he 
<A NAME="116"></A>found the judges no way favourable to him, yet at last, their voices being 
<A NAME="117"></A>equal, contrary to all expectation, he was acquitted.
<A NAME="118"></A><BR><BR>In his praetorship he did not get much honour, yet after it he 
<A NAME="119"></A>obtained the further Spain; which province he is said to have cleared of 
<A NAME="120"></A>robbers, with which it was much infested, the old barbarous habits still 
<A NAME="121"></A>prevailing, and the Spaniards, in those days, still regarding robbery as 
<A NAME="122"></A>a piece of valour. In the city he had neither riches nor eloquence to trust 
<A NAME="123"></A>to, with which the leading men of the time obtained power with the people, 
<A NAME="124"></A>but his vehement disposition, his indefatigable labours, and his plain 
<A NAME="125"></A>way of living, of themselves gained him esteem and influence; so that he 
<A NAME="126"></A>made an honourable match with Julia, of the distinguished family of the 
<A NAME="127"></A>Caesars, to whom that Caesar was nephew who was afterwards so great among 
<A NAME="128"></A>the Romans, and, in some degree, from his relationship, made Marius his 
<A NAME="129"></A>example, as in his life we have observed.
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR>Marius is praised for both temperance and endurance, of which latter 
<A NAME="131"></A>he gave a decided instance in an operation of surgery. For having, as it 
<A NAME="132"></A>seems, both his legs full of great tumours, and disliking the deformity, 
<A NAME="133"></A>he determined to put himself into the hands of an operator; when, without 
<A NAME="134"></A>being tied, he stretched out one of his legs, and silently, without changing 
<A NAME="135"></A>countenance, endured most excessive torments in the cutting, never either 
<A NAME="136"></A>flinching or complaining; but when the surgeon went to the other, he declined 
<A NAME="137"></A>to have it done, saying, "I see the cure is not worth the 
<A NAME="138"></A>pain."
<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR>The consul Caecilius Metellus, being declared general in the war 
<A NAME="140"></A>against Jugurtha in Africa took with him Marius for lieutenant; where, 
<A NAME="141"></A>eager himself to do great deeds and services that would get him distinction, 
<A NAME="142"></A>he did not, like others, consult Metellus's glory and the serving his interest, 
<A NAME="143"></A>and attributing his honour of lieutenancy not to Metellus, but to fortune, 
<A NAME="144"></A>which had presented him with a proper opportunity and theatre of great 
<A NAME="145"></A>actions, he exerted his utmost courage. That war, too, affording several 
<A NAME="146"></A>difficulties, he neither declined the greatest, nor disdained undertaking 
<A NAME="147"></A>the least of them, but surpassing his equals in counsel and conduct, and 
<A NAME="148"></A>matching the very common soldiers in labour and abstemiousness, he gained 
<A NAME="149"></A>great popularity with them; as indeed any voluntary partaking with people 
<A NAME="150"></A>in their labour is felt as an easing of that labour, as it seems to take 
<A NAME="151"></A>away the constraint and necessity of it. It is the most obliging sight 
<A NAME="152"></A>in the world to the Roman soldier to see a commander eat the same bread 
<A NAME="153"></A>as himself, or lie upon an ordinary bed, or assist the work in the drawing 
<A NAME="154"></A>a trench and raising a bulwark. For they do not so much admire those that 
<A NAME="155"></A>confer honours and riches upon them, as those that partake of the same 
<A NAME="156"></A>labour and danger with themselves; but love them better that will vouchsafe 
<A NAME="157"></A>to join in their work, than those that encourage their 
<A NAME="158"></A>idleness.
<A NAME="159"></A><BR><BR>Marius thus employed, and thus winning the affections of the soldiers, 
<A NAME="160"></A>before long filled both Africa and Rome with his fame, and some, too, wrote 
<A NAME="161"></A>home from the army that the war with Africa would never be brought to a 
<A NAME="162"></A>conclusion unless they chose Caius Marius consul. All which was evidently 
<A NAME="163"></A>unpleasing to Metellus; but what more especially grieved him was the calamity 
<A NAME="164"></A>of Turpillius. This Turpillius had, from his ancestors, been a friend of 
<A NAME="165"></A>Metellus, and kept up a constant hospitality with him, and was now serving 
<A NAME="166"></A>in the war in command of the smiths and carpenters of the army. Having 
<A NAME="167"></A>the charge of a garrison in Vaga, a considerable city, and trusting too 
<A NAME="168"></A>much to the inhabitants, because he treated them civilly and kindly, he 
<A NAME="169"></A>unawares fell into the enemy's hands. They received Jugurtha into the city; 
<A NAME="170"></A>yet nevertheless, at their request, Turpillius was dismissed safe and without 
<A NAME="171"></A>receiving any injury; whereupon he was accused of betraying it to the enemy. 
<A NAME="172"></A>Marius, being one of the council of war, was not only violent against him 
<A NAME="173"></A>himself, but also incensed most of the others, so that Metellus was forced, 
<A NAME="174"></A>much against his will, to put him to death. Not long after the accusation 
<A NAME="175"></A>proved false, and when others were comforting Metellus, who took heavily 
<A NAME="176"></A>the loss of his friend, Marius, rather insulting and arrogating it to himself, 
<A NAME="177"></A>boasted in all companies that he had involved Metellus in the guilt of 
<A NAME="178"></A>putting his friend to death.
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR>Henceforward they were at open variance; and it is reported that 
<A NAME="180"></A>Metellus once, when Marius was present, said insultingly, "You, sir, design 
<A NAME="181"></A>to leave us to go home and stand for the consulship, and will not be content 
<A NAME="182"></A>to wait and be consul with this boy of mine?" Metellus's son being a mere 
<A NAME="183"></A>boy at the time. Yet for all this Marius being very importunate to be gone, 
<A NAME="184"></A>after several delays, he was dismissed about twelve days before the election 
<A NAME="185"></A>of consuls; and performed that long journey from the camp to the seaport 
<A NAME="186"></A>of Utica in two days and a night, and there doing sacrifice before he went 
<A NAME="187"></A>on shipboard, it is said the augur told him that heaven promised him some 
<A NAME="188"></A>incredible good fortune, and such as was beyond all expectation. Marius, 
<A NAME="189"></A>not a little elated with his good omen, began his voyage, and in four days, 
<A NAME="190"></A>with a favourable wind, passed the sea; he was welcomed with great joy 
<A NAME="191"></A>by the people, and being brought into the assembly by one of the tribunes, 
<A NAME="192"></A>sued for the consulship, inveighing in all ways against Metellus, and promising 
<A NAME="193"></A>either to slay Jugurtha or take him alive.
<A NAME="194"></A><BR><BR>He was elected triumphantly, and at once proceeded to levy soldiers 
<A NAME="195"></A>contrary both to law and custom, enlisting slaves and poor people; whereas 
<A NAME="196"></A>former commanders never accepted of such, but bestowed arms, like other 
<A NAME="197"></A>favours, as a matter of distinction, on persons who had the proper qualification, 
<A NAME="198"></A>a man's property being thus a sort of security for his good behaviour. 
<A NAME="199"></A>These were not the only occasions of ill-will against Marius; some haughty 
<A NAME="200"></A>speeches, uttered with great arrogance and contempt, gave great offence 
<A NAME="201"></A>to the nobility; as, for example, his saying that he had carried off the 
<A NAME="202"></A>consulship as a spoil from the effeminacy of the wealthy and high-born 
<A NAME="203"></A>citizens, and telling the people that he gloried in wounds he had himself 
<A NAME="204"></A>received for them, as much as others did in the monuments of dead men, 
<A NAME="205"></A>and images of their ancestors. Often speaking of the commanders that had 
<A NAME="206"></A>been unfortunate in Africa, naming Bestia, for example, and Albinus, men 
<A NAME="207"></A>of very good families, but unfit for war, and who had miscarried through 
<A NAME="208"></A>want of experience, he asked the people about him if they did not think 
<A NAME="209"></A>that the ancestors of these nobles had much rather have left a descendant 
<A NAME="210"></A>like him, since they themselves grew famous not by nobility, but by their 
<A NAME="211"></A>valour and great actions? This he did not say merely out of vanity and 
<A NAME="212"></A>arrogance, or that he were willing, without any advantage, to offend the 
<A NAME="213"></A>nobility; but the people always delighting in affronts and scurrilous contumelies 
<A NAME="214"></A>against the senate, making boldness of speech their measure of greatness 
<A NAME="215"></A>of spirit, continually encouraged him in it, and strengthened his inclination 
<A NAME="216"></A>not to spare persons of repute, so he might gratify the 
<A NAME="217"></A>multitude.
<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR>As soon as he arrived again in Africa, Metellus, no longer able 
<A NAME="219"></A>to control his feelings of jealousy, and his indignation that now when 
<A NAME="220"></A>he had really finished the war, and nothing was left but to secure the 
<A NAME="221"></A>person of Jugurtha, Marius, grown great merely through his ingratitude 
<A NAME="222"></A>to him, should come to bereave him both of his victory and triumph, could 
<A NAME="223"></A>not bear to have any interview with him; but retired himself, whilst Rutilius, 
<A NAME="224"></A>his lieutenant, surrendered up the army to Marius, whose conduct, however, 
<A NAME="225"></A>in the end of the war, met with some sort of retribution, as Sylla deprived 
<A NAME="226"></A>him of the glory of the action as he had done Metellus. I shall state the 
<A NAME="227"></A>circumstances briefly here as they are given at large in the life of Sylla. 
<A NAME="228"></A>Bocchus was king of the more distant barbarians, and was father-in-law 
<A NAME="229"></A>to Jugurtha, yet sent him little or no assistance in his war, professing 
<A NAME="230"></A>fears of his unfaithfulness, and really jealous of his growing power; but 
<A NAME="231"></A>after Jugurtha fled, and in his distress came to him as his last hope, 
<A NAME="232"></A>he received him as a suppliant, rather because ashamed to do otherwise 
<A NAME="233"></A>than out of real kindness; and when he had him in his power, he openly 
<A NAME="234"></A>entreated Marius on his behalf, and interceded for him with bold words, 
<A NAME="235"></A>giving out that he would by no means deliver him. Yet privately designing 
<A NAME="236"></A>to betray him, he sent for Lucius Sylla, quaestor to Marius, and who had 
<A NAME="237"></A>on a previous occasion befriended Bocchus in the war. When Sylla, relying 
<A NAME="238"></A>on his word, came to him, the African began to doubt and repent of his 
<A NAME="239"></A>purpose, and for several days was unresolved with himself, whether he should 
<A NAME="240"></A>deliver Jugurtha or retain Sylla; at length he fixed upon his former treachery, 
<A NAME="241"></A>and put Jugurtha alive into Sylla's possession. Thus was the first occasion 
<A NAME="242"></A>given of that fierce and implacable hostility which so nearly ruined the 
<A NAME="243"></A>whole Roman empire. For many that envied Marius attributed the success 
<A NAME="244"></A>wholly to Sylla, and Sylla himself got a seal made, on which was engraved 
<A NAME="245"></A>Bocchus betraying Jugurtha to him, and constantly used it, irritating the 
<A NAME="246"></A>hot and jealous temper of Marius, who was naturally greedy of distinction, 
<A NAME="247"></A>and quick to resent any claim to share in his glory, and whose enemies 
<A NAME="248"></A>took care to promote the quarrel, ascribing the beginning and chief business 
<A NAME="249"></A>of the war to Metellus and its conclusion to Sylla; that so the people 
<A NAME="250"></A>might give over admiring and esteeming Marius as the worthiest 
<A NAME="251"></A>person.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR>But these envyings and calumnies were soon dispersed and cleared 
<A NAME="253"></A>away from Marius by the danger that threatened Italy from the west; when 
<A NAME="254"></A>the city, in great need of a good commander, sought about whom she might 
<A NAME="255"></A>set at the helm to meet the tempest of so great a war, no one would have 
<A NAME="256"></A>anything to say to any members of noble or potent families who offered 
<A NAME="257"></A>themselves for the consulship, and Marius, though then absent, was 
<A NAME="258"></A>elected.
<A NAME="259"></A><BR><BR>Jugurtha's apprehension was only just known, when the news of the 
<A NAME="260"></A>invasion of the Teutones and Cimbri began. The accounts at first exceeded 
<A NAME="261"></A>all credit, as to the number and strength of the approaching army, but 
<A NAME="262"></A>in the end report proved much inferior to truth, as they were three hundred 
<A NAME="263"></A>thousand effective fighting men, besides a far greater number of women 
<A NAME="264"></A>and children. They professed to be seeking new countries to sustain these 
<A NAME="265"></A>great multitudes, and cities where they might settle and inhabit, in the 
<A NAME="266"></A>same way as they had heard the Celti before them had driven out the Tyrrhenians, 
<A NAME="267"></A>and possessed themselves of the best part of Italy. Having had no commerce 
<A NAME="268"></A>with the southern nations, and travelling over a wide extent of country, 
<A NAME="269"></A>no man knew what people they were, or whence they came, that thus like 
<A NAME="270"></A>a cloud burst over Gaul and Italy; yet by their grey eyes and the largeness 
<A NAME="271"></A>of their stature they were conjectured to be some of the German races dwelling 
<A NAME="272"></A>by the northern sea; besides that, the Germans call plunderers 
<A NAME="273"></A>Cimbri.
<A NAME="274"></A><BR><BR>There are some that say that the country of the Celti, in its vast 
<A NAME="275"></A>size and extent, reaches from the furthest sea and the arctic regions to 
<A NAME="276"></A>the lake Maeotis eastward, and to that part of Scythia which is near Pontus, 
<A NAME="277"></A>and that there the nations mingle together; that they did not swarm out 
<A NAME="278"></A>of their country all at once, or on a sudden, but advancing by force of 
<A NAME="279"></A>arms, in the summer season, every year, in the course of time they crossed 
<A NAME="280"></A>the whole continent. And thus, though each party had several appellations, 
<A NAME="281"></A>yet the whole army was called by the common name of Celto-Scythians. Others 
<A NAME="282"></A>say that the Cimmerii, anciently known to the Greeks, were only a small 
<A NAME="283"></A>part of the nation, who were driven out upon some quarrel among the Scythians, 
<A NAME="284"></A>and passed all along from the lake Maeotis to Asia, under the conduct of 
<A NAME="285"></A>one Lygdamis; and that the greater and more warlike part of them still 
<A NAME="286"></A>inhabit the remotest regions lying upon the outer ocean. These, they say, 
<A NAME="287"></A>live in a dark and woody country hardly penetrable by the sunbeams, the 
<A NAME="288"></A>trees are so close and thick, extending into the interior as far as the 
<A NAME="289"></A>Hercynian forest; and their position on the earth is under that part of 
<A NAME="290"></A>heaven where the pole is so elevated that, by the declination of the parallels, 
<A NAME="291"></A>the zenith of the inhabitants seems to be but little distant from it; and 
<A NAME="292"></A>that their days and nights being almost of an equal length, they divide 
<A NAME="293"></A>their year into one of each. This was Homer's occasion for the story of 
<A NAME="294"></A>Ulysses calling up the dead, and from this region the people, anciently 
<A NAME="295"></A>called Cimmerii, and afterwards, by an easy change, Cimbri, came into Italy. 
<A NAME="296"></A>All this, however, is rather conjecture than an authentic 
<A NAME="297"></A>history.
<A NAME="298"></A><BR><BR>Their numbers, most writers agree, were not less, but rather greater 
<A NAME="299"></A>than was reported. They were of invincible strength and fierceness in their 
<A NAME="300"></A>wars, and hurried into battle with the violence of a devouring flame; none 
<A NAME="301"></A>could withstand them: all they assaulted became their prey. Several of 
<A NAME="302"></A>the greatest Roman commanders with their whole armies, that advanced for 
<A NAME="303"></A>the defence of Transalpine Gaul, were ingloriously overthrown, and, indeed, 
<A NAME="304"></A>by their faint resistance, chiefly gave them the impulse of marching towards 
<A NAME="305"></A>Rome. Having vanquished all they had met, and found abundance of plunder, 
<A NAME="306"></A>they resolved to settle themselves nowhere till they should have razed 
<A NAME="307"></A>the city and wasted all Italy. The Romans, being from all parts alarmed 
<A NAME="308"></A>with this news, sent for Marius to undertake the war, and nominated him 
<A NAME="309"></A>the second time consul, though the law did not permit any one that was 
<A NAME="310"></A>absent, or that had not waited a certain time after his first consulship, 
<A NAME="311"></A>to be again created. But the people rejected all opposers, for they considered 
<A NAME="312"></A>this was not the first time that the law gave place to the common interest; 
<A NAME="313"></A>nor the present occasion less urgent than that when, contrary to law, they 
<A NAME="314"></A>made Scipio consul, not in fear for the destruction of their own city, 
<A NAME="315"></A>but desiring the ruin of that of the Carthaginians.
<A NAME="316"></A><BR><BR>Thus it was decided; and Marius, bringing over his legions out 
<A NAME="317"></A>of Africa on the very first day of January, which the Romans count the 
<A NAME="318"></A>beginning of the year, received the consulship, and then, also, entered 
<A NAME="319"></A>in triumph, showing Jugurtha a prisoner to the people, a sight they had 
<A NAME="320"></A>despaired of ever beholding, nor could any, so long as he lived, hope to 
<A NAME="321"></A>reduce the enemy in Africa; so fertile in expedients was he to adapt himself 
<A NAME="322"></A>to every turn of fortune, and so bold as well as subtle. When, however, 
<A NAME="323"></A>he was led in triumph, it is said that he fell distracted, and when he 
<A NAME="324"></A>was afterwards thrown into prison, where some tore off his clothes by force, 
<A NAME="325"></A>and others, whilst they struggled for his golden earring, with it pulled 
<A NAME="326"></A>off the tip of his ear, and when he was, after this, cast naked into the 
<A NAME="327"></A>dungeon, in his amazement and confusion, with a ghastly laugh, he cried 
<A NAME="328"></A>out, "O Hercules! how cold your bath is!" Here for six days struggling 
<A NAME="329"></A>with hunger, and to the very last minute desirous of life, he was overtaken 
<A NAME="330"></A>by the just reward of his villainies. In this triumph was brought, as is 
<A NAME="331"></A>stated, of gold three thousand and seven pounds weight, of silver bullion 
<A NAME="332"></A>five thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, of money in gold and silver 
<A NAME="333"></A>coin two hundred and eighty-seven thousand drachmas. After the solemnity, 
<A NAME="334"></A>Marius called together the senate in the capitol, and entered, whether 
<A NAME="335"></A>through inadvertency or unbecoming exultation with his good fortune, in 
<A NAME="336"></A>his triumphal habit; but presently observing the senate offended at it, 
<A NAME="337"></A>went out, and returned in his ordinary purple-bordered 
<A NAME="338"></A>robe.
<A NAME="339"></A><BR><BR>On the expedition he carefully disciplined and trained his army 
<A NAME="340"></A>whilst they were on their way, giving them practice in long marches, and 
<A NAME="341"></A>running of every sort, and compelling every man to carry his own baggage 
<A NAME="342"></A>and prepare his own victuals; insomuch that thenceforward laborious soldiers, 
<A NAME="343"></A>who did their work silently without grumbling, had the name of "Marius's 
<A NAME="344"></A>mules." Some, however, think the proverb had a different occasion; that 
<A NAME="345"></A>when Scipio besieged Numantia, and was careful to inspect not only their 
<A NAME="346"></A>horses and arms, but their mules and carriages too, and see how well equipped 
<A NAME="347"></A>and in what readiness each one's was, Marius brought forth his horse which 
<A NAME="348"></A>he had fed extremely well, and a mule in better case, stronger and gentler 
<A NAME="349"></A>than those of others; that the general was very well pleased, and often 
<A NAME="350"></A>afterwards mentioned Marius's beasts; and that hence the soldiers, when 
<A NAME="351"></A>speaking jestingly in the praise of a drudging laborious fellow, called 
<A NAME="352"></A>him Marius's mule.
<A NAME="353"></A><BR><BR>But to proceed; very great fortune seemed to attend Marius, for 
<A NAME="354"></A>by the enemy in a manner changing their course, and falling first upon 
<A NAME="355"></A>Spain, he had time to exercise his soldiers, and confirm their courage, 
<A NAME="356"></A>and, which was most important, to show them what he himself was. For that 
<A NAME="357"></A>fierce manner of his in command, and inexorableness in punishing, when 
<A NAME="358"></A>his men became used not to do amiss or disobey, was felt to be wholesome 
<A NAME="359"></A>and advantageous, as well as just, and his violent spirit, stern voice, 
<A NAME="360"></A>and harsh aspect, which in a little while grew familiar to them, they esteemed 
<A NAME="361"></A>terrible not to themselves, but only to their enemies. But his uprightness 
<A NAME="362"></A>in judging more especially pleased the soldiers, one remarkable instance 
<A NAME="363"></A>of which is as follows. One Caius Lusius, his own nephew, had a command 
<A NAME="364"></A>under him in the army, a man not in other respects of bad character, but 
<A NAME="365"></A>shamefully licentious with young men. He had one young man under his command 
<A NAME="366"></A>called Trebonius, with whom notwithstanding many solicitations he could 
<A NAME="367"></A>never prevail. At length one night he sent a messenger for him and Trebonius 
<A NAME="368"></A>came, as it was not lawful for him to refuse when he was sent for, and 
<A NAME="369"></A>being brought into his tent, when Lusius began to use violence with him, 
<A NAME="370"></A>he drew his sword and ran him through. This was done whilst Marius was 
<A NAME="371"></A>absent. When he returned, he appointed Trebonius a time for his trial, 
<A NAME="372"></A>where, whilst many accused him, and not any one appeared in his defence, 
<A NAME="373"></A>he himself boldly related the whole matter, and brought witness of his 
<A NAME="374"></A>previous conduct to Lusius, who had frequently offered him considerable 
<A NAME="375"></A>presents. Marius, admiring his conduct and much pleased, commanded the 
<A NAME="376"></A>garland, the usual Roman reward of valour, to be brought, and himself crowned 
<A NAME="377"></A>Trebonius with it, as having performed an excellent action, at a time that 
<A NAME="378"></A>very much wanted such good examples.
<A NAME="379"></A><BR><BR>This being told at Rome, proved no small help to Marius towards 
<A NAME="380"></A>his third consulship; to which also conduced the expectation of the barbarians 
<A NAME="381"></A>at the summer season, the people being unwilling to trust their fortunes 
<A NAME="382"></A>with any other general but him. However, their arrival was not so early 
<A NAME="383"></A>as was imagined, and the time of Marius's consulship was again expired. 
<A NAME="384"></A>The election coming on, and his colleague being dead, he left the command 
<A NAME="385"></A>of the army to Manius Aquilius, and hastened to Rome, where, several eminent 
<A NAME="386"></A>persons being candidates for the consulship, Lucius Saturninus, who more 
<A NAME="387"></A>than any of the other tribunes swayed the populace, and of whom Marius 
<A NAME="388"></A>himself was very observant, exerted his eloquence with the people, advising 
<A NAME="389"></A>them to choose Marius consul. He playing the modest part, and professing 
<A NAME="390"></A>to decline the office, Saturninus called him traitor to his country if, 
<A NAME="391"></A>in such apparent danger, he would avoid command. And though it was not 
<A NAME="392"></A>difficult to discover that he was merely helping Marius in putting this 
<A NAME="393"></A>pretence upon the people, yet, considering that the present juncture much 
<A NAME="394"></A>required his skill, and his good fortunes too, they voted him the fourth 
<A NAME="395"></A>time consul, and made Catulus Lutatius his colleague, a man very much esteemed 
<A NAME="396"></A>by the nobility and not unagreeable to the commons.
<A NAME="397"></A><BR><BR>Marius, having notice of the enemy's approach, with all expedition 
<A NAME="398"></A>passed the Alps, and pitching his camp by the river Rhone, took care first 
<A NAME="399"></A>for plentiful supplies of victuals: lest at any time he should be forced 
<A NAME="400"></A>to fight at a disadvantage for want of necessaries. The carriage of provision 
<A NAME="401"></A>for the army from the sea, which was formerly long and expensive, he made 
<A NAME="402"></A>speedy and easy. For the mouth, of the Rhone, by the influx of the sea, 
<A NAME="403"></A>being barred and almost filled up with sand and mud mixed with clay, the 
<A NAME="404"></A>passage there became narrow, difficult, and dangerous for the ships that 
<A NAME="405"></A>brought their provisions. Hither, therefore, bringing his army, then at 
<A NAME="406"></A>leisure, he drew a great trench: and by turning the course of a great part 
<A NAME="407"></A>of the river, brought it to a convenient point on the shore where the water 
<A NAME="408"></A>was deep enough to receive ships of considerable burden, and where there 
<A NAME="409"></A>was a calm and easy opening to the sea. And this still retains the name 
<A NAME="410"></A>it took from him.
<A NAME="411"></A><BR><BR>The enemy dividing themselves into two parts, the Cimbri arranged 
<A NAME="412"></A>to go against Catulus higher up through the country of the Norici, and 
<A NAME="413"></A>to force that passage; the Teutones and Ambrones to march against Marius 
<A NAME="414"></A>by the seaside through Liguria. The Cimbri were a considerable time in 
<A NAME="415"></A>doing their part. But the Teutones and Ambrones with all expedition passing 
<A NAME="416"></A>over the interjacent country, soon came in sight, in numbers beyond belief, 
<A NAME="417"></A>of a terrible aspect, and uttering strange cries and shouts. Taking up 
<A NAME="418"></A>a great part of the plain with their camp, they challenged Marius to battle; 
<A NAME="419"></A>he seemed to take no notice of them, but kept his soldiers within their 
<A NAME="420"></A>fortification, and sharply reprehended those that were too forward and 
<A NAME="421"></A>eager to show their courage, and who, out of passion, would needs be fighting, 
<A NAME="422"></A>calling them traitors to their country, and telling them they were not 
<A NAME="423"></A>now to think of the glory of triumphs and trophies, but rather how they 
<A NAME="424"></A>might repel such an impetuous tempest of war and save 
<A NAME="425"></A>Italy.
<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR>Thus he discoursed privately with his officers and equals, but 
<A NAME="427"></A>placed the soldiers by turns upon the bulwarks to survey the enemy, and 
<A NAME="428"></A>so made them familiar with their shape and voice, which were indeed altogether 
<A NAME="429"></A>extravagant and barbarous, and he caused them to observe their arms, and 
<A NAME="430"></A>the way of using them, so that in a little time what at first appeared 
<A NAME="431"></A>terrible to their apprehensions, by often viewing became familiar. For 
<A NAME="432"></A>he very rationally supposed that the strangeness of things often makes 
<A NAME="433"></A>them seem formidable when they are not so; and that by our better acquaintance, 
<A NAME="434"></A>even things which are really terrible lose much of their frightfulness. 
<A NAME="435"></A>This daily converse not only diminished some of the soldiers' fears, but 
<A NAME="436"></A>their indignation warmed and inflamed their courage when they heard the 
<A NAME="437"></A>threats and insupportable insolence of their enemies; who not only plundered 
<A NAME="438"></A>and depopulated all the country round, but would even contemptuously and 
<A NAME="439"></A>confidently attack the ramparts.
<A NAME="440"></A><BR><BR>Complaints of the soldiers now began to come to Marius's ears. 
<A NAME="441"></A>"What effeminacy does Marius see in us, that he should thus like women 
<A NAME="442"></A>lock us up from encountering our enemies? Come on, let us show ourselves 
<A NAME="443"></A>men, and ask him if he expects others to fight for Italy; and means merely 
<A NAME="444"></A>to employ us in servile offices, when he would dig trenches, cleanse places 
<A NAME="445"></A>of mud and dirt, and turn the course of the rivers? It was to do such works 
<A NAME="446"></A>as these, it seems, that he gave us all our long training; he will return 
<A NAME="447"></A>home, and boast of these great performances of his consulships to the people. 
<A NAME="448"></A>Does the defeat of Carbo and Caepio, who were vanquished by the enemy, 
<A NAME="449"></A>affright him? Surely they were much inferior to Marius both in glory and 
<A NAME="450"></A>valour, and commanded a much weaker army: at the worst, it is better to 
<A NAME="451"></A>be in action, though we suffer for it like them, than to sit idle spectators 
<A NAME="452"></A>of the destruction of our allies and companions." Marius, not a little 
<A NAME="453"></A>pleased to hear this, gently appeased them, pretending that he did not 
<A NAME="454"></A>distrust their valour, but that he took his measures as to the time and 
<A NAME="455"></A>place of victory from some certain oracles.
<A NAME="456"></A><BR><BR>And, in fact, he used solemnly to carry about in a litter a Syrian 
<A NAME="457"></A>woman, called Martha, a supposed prophetess, and to do sacrifice by her 
<A NAME="458"></A>directions. She had formerly been driven away by the senate, to whom she 
<A NAME="459"></A>addressed herself, offering to inform them about these affairs, and to 
<A NAME="460"></A>foretell future events; and after this betook herself to the women, and 
<A NAME="461"></A>gave them proofs of her skill, especially Marius's wife, at whose feet 
<A NAME="462"></A>she sat when she was viewing a contest of gladiators, and correctly foretold 
<A NAME="463"></A>which of them should overcome. She was for this and the like predictings 
<A NAME="464"></A>sent by her to Marius and the army, where she was very much looked up to, 
<A NAME="465"></A>and, for the most part, carried about in a litter. When she went to sacrifice, 
<A NAME="466"></A>she wore a purple robe lined and buckled up, and had in her hand a little 
<A NAME="467"></A>spear trimmed with ribbons and garlands. This theatrical show made many 
<A NAME="468"></A>question whether Marius really gave any credit to her himself, or only 
<A NAME="469"></A>played the counterfeit, when he showed her publicly, to impose upon the 
<A NAME="470"></A>soldiers.
<A NAME="471"></A><BR><BR>What, however, Alexander the Myndian relates about the vultures 
<A NAME="472"></A>does really deserve admiration; that always before Marius's victories there 
<A NAME="473"></A>appeared two of them, and accompanied the army, which were known by their 
<A NAME="474"></A>brazen collars (the soldiers having caught them and put these about their 
<A NAME="475"></A>necks, and so let them go, from which time they in a manner knew and saluted 
<A NAME="476"></A>the soldiers), and whenever these appeared in their marches, they used 
<A NAME="477"></A>to rejoice at it, and thought themselves sure of some success. Of the many 
<A NAME="478"></A>other prodigies that then were taken notice of, the greater part were but 
<A NAME="479"></A>of the ordinary stamp; it was, however, reported that at Ameria and Tuder, 
<A NAME="480"></A>two cities in Italy, there were seen at nights in the sky flaming darts 
<A NAME="481"></A>and shields, now waved about, and then again clashing against one another, 
<A NAME="482"></A>all in accordance with the postures and motions soldiers use in fighting; 
<A NAME="483"></A>that at length one party retreating, and the other pursuing, they all disappeared 
<A NAME="484"></A>westward. Much about the same time came Bataces, one of Cybele's priests, 
<A NAME="485"></A>from Pessinus, and reported how the goddess had declared to him out of 
<A NAME="486"></A>her oracle that the Romans should obtain the victory. The senate giving 
<A NAME="487"></A>credit to him, and voting the goddess a temple to be built in hopes of 
<A NAME="488"></A>the victory, Aulus Pompeius, a tribune, prevented Bataces, when he would 
<A NAME="489"></A>have gone and told the people this same story, calling him impostor, and 
<A NAME="490"></A>ignominiously pulling him off the hustings; which action in the end was 
<A NAME="491"></A>the main thing that gained credit for the man's story, for Aulus had scarce 
<A NAME="492"></A>dissolved the assembly, and returned home, when a violent fever seized 
<A NAME="493"></A>him, and it was matter of universal remark, and in everybody's mouth, that 
<A NAME="494"></A>he died within a week after.
<A NAME="495"></A><BR><BR>Now the Teutones, whilst Marius lay quiet, ventured to attack his 
<A NAME="496"></A>camp; from whence, however, being encountered with showers of darts, and 
<A NAME="497"></A>losing several of their men, they determined to march forward, hoping to 
<A NAME="498"></A>reach the other side of the Alps without opposition, and, packing up their 
<A NAME="499"></A>baggage, passed securely by the Roman camp, where the greatness of their 
<A NAME="500"></A>number was especially made evident by the long time they took in their 
<A NAME="501"></A>march, for they were said to be six days continually going on in passing 
<A NAME="502"></A>Marius's fortifications; they marched pretty near, and revilingly asked 
<A NAME="503"></A>the Romans if they would send any commands by them to their wives, for 
<A NAME="504"></A>they would shortly be with them. As soon as they were passed and had gone 
<A NAME="505"></A>on a little distance ahead, Marius began to move, and follow them at his 
<A NAME="506"></A>leisure, always encamping at some small distance from them; choosing also 
<A NAME="507"></A>strong positions, and carefully fortifying them, that he might quarter 
<A NAME="508"></A>with safety. Thus they marched till they came to the place called Sextilius's 
<A NAME="509"></A>Waters, from whence it was but a short way before being amidst the Alps, 
<A NAME="510"></A>and here Marius put himself in readiness for the encounter.
<A NAME="511"></A><BR><BR>He chose a place for his camp of considerable strength, but where 
<A NAME="512"></A>there was a scarcity of water; designing, it is said, by this means, also, 
<A NAME="513"></A>to put an edge on his soldiers' courage; and when several were not a little 
<A NAME="514"></A>distressed, and complained of thirst, pointing to a river that ran near 
<A NAME="515"></A>the enemy's camp; "There," said he, "you may have drink, if you will buy 
<A NAME="516"></A>it with your blood." "Why, then," replied they, "do you not lead us to 
<A NAME="517"></A>them, before our blood is dried up in us?" He answered, in a softer tone, 
<A NAME="518"></A>"Let us first fortify our camp," and the soldiers, though not without repining, 
<A NAME="519"></A>proceeded to obey. Now a great company of their boys and camp followers, 
<A NAME="520"></A>having neither drink for themselves nor for their horses, went down to 
<A NAME="521"></A>that river; some taking axes and hatchets, and some, too, swords and darts 
<A NAME="522"></A>with their pitchers, resolving to have water though they fought for it. 
<A NAME="523"></A>These were first encountered by a small party of the enemies; for most 
<A NAME="524"></A>of them had just finished bathing, and were eating and drinking, and several 
<A NAME="525"></A>were still bathing, the country thereabouts abounding in hot springs; so 
<A NAME="526"></A>that the Romans partly fell upon them whilst they were enjoying themselves 
<A NAME="527"></A>and occupied with the novel sights and pleasantness of the place. Upon 
<A NAME="528"></A>hearing the shouts, great numbers still joining in the fight, it was not 
<A NAME="529"></A>a little difficult for Marius to contain his soldiers, who were afraid 
<A NAME="530"></A>of losing the camp servants; and the more warlike part of the enemies, 
<A NAME="531"></A>who had overthrown Manlius and Caepio (they were called Ambrones, and were 
<A NAME="532"></A>in number, one with another, above thirty thousand), taking the alarm, 
<A NAME="533"></A>leaped up and hurried to arms.
<A NAME="534"></A><BR><BR>These, though they had just been gorging themselves with food, 
<A NAME="535"></A>and were excited and disordered with drink, nevertheless did not advance 
<A NAME="536"></A>with an unruly step, or in mere senseless fury, nor were their shouts mere 
<A NAME="537"></A>inarticulate cries; but clashing their arms in concert and keeping time 
<A NAME="538"></A>as they leapt and bounded onward, they continually repeated their own name, 
<A NAME="539"></A>"Ambrones!" either to encourage one another, or to strike the greater terror 
<A NAME="540"></A>into their enemies. Of all the Italians in Marius's army, the Ligurians 
<A NAME="541"></A>were the first that charged; and when they caught the word of the enemy's 
<A NAME="542"></A>confused shout, they, too, returned the same, as it was an ancient name 
<A NAME="543"></A>also in their country, the Ligurians always using it when speaking of their 
<A NAME="544"></A>descent. This acclamation, bandied from one army to the other before they 
<A NAME="545"></A>joined, served to rouse and heighten their fury, while the men on either 
<A NAME="546"></A>side strove, with all possible vehemence, the one to overshout the 
<A NAME="547"></A>other.
<A NAME="548"></A><BR><BR>The river disordered the Ambrones; before they could draw up all 
<A NAME="549"></A>their army on the other side of it, the Ligurians presently fell upon the 
<A NAME="550"></A>van, and began to charge them hand to hand. The Romans, too, coming to 
<A NAME="551"></A>their assistance, and from the higher ground pouring upon the enemy, forcibly 
<A NAME="552"></A>repelled them, and the most of them (one thrusting another into the river) 
<A NAME="553"></A>were there slain, and filled it with their blood and dead bodies. Those 
<A NAME="554"></A>that got safe over, not daring to make head, were slain by the Romans, 
<A NAME="555"></A>as they fled to their camp and wagons; where the women meeting them with 
<A NAME="556"></A>swords and hatchets, and making a hideous outcry, set upon those that fled 
<A NAME="557"></A>as well as those that pursued, the one as traitors, the other as enemies, 
<A NAME="558"></A>and mixing themselves with the combatants, with their bare arms pulling 
<A NAME="559"></A>away the Romans' shields, and laying hold on their swords, endured the 
<A NAME="560"></A>wounds and slashing of their bodies to the very last with undaunted resolution. 
<A NAME="561"></A>Thus the battle seems to have happened at that river rather by accident 
<A NAME="562"></A>than by the design of the general.
<A NAME="563"></A><BR><BR>After the Romans were retired from the great slaughter of the Ambrones, 
<A NAME="564"></A>night came on; but the army was not indulged, as was the usual custom, 
<A NAME="565"></A>with songs of victory, drinking in their tents, and mutual entertainments 
<A NAME="566"></A>and (what is most welcome to soldiers after successful fighting) quiet 
<A NAME="567"></A>sleep, but they passed that night, above all others, in fears and alarm. 
<A NAME="568"></A>For their camp was without either rampart or palisade, and there remained 
<A NAME="569"></A>thousands upon thousands of their enemies yet unconquered; to whom were 
<A NAME="570"></A>joined as many of the Ambrones as escaped. There were heard from these 
<A NAME="571"></A>all through the night wild bewailings, nothing like the sighs and groans 
<A NAME="572"></A>of men, but a sort of wild-beast-like howling and cursing joined with threats 
<A NAME="573"></A>and lamentations rising from the vast multitude, and echoed among the neighbouring 
<A NAME="574"></A>hills and hollow banks of the river. The whole plain was filled with hideous 
<A NAME="575"></A>noise, insomuch that the Romans were not a little afraid and Marius himself 
<A NAME="576"></A>was apprehensive of a confused tumultuous night engagement. But the enemy 
<A NAME="577"></A>did not stir either this night or the next day, but were employed in disposing 
<A NAME="578"></A>and drawing themselves up to the greatest advantage.
<A NAME="579"></A><BR><BR>Of this occasion Marius made good use; for there were beyond the 
<A NAME="580"></A>enemies some wooded ascents and deep valleys thickly set with trees, whither 
<A NAME="581"></A>he sent Claudius Marcellus, secretly, with three thousand regular soldiers, 
<A NAME="582"></A>giving him orders to post them in ambush there, and show themselves at 
<A NAME="583"></A>the rear of the enemies when the fight was begun. The others, refreshed 
<A NAME="584"></A>with victuals and sleep, as soon as it was day he drew up before the camp, 
<A NAME="585"></A>and commanded the horse to sally out into the plain, at the sight of which 
<A NAME="586"></A>the Teutones could not contain themselves till the Romans should come down 
<A NAME="587"></A>and fight them on equal terms, but hastily arming themselves, charged in 
<A NAME="588"></A>their fury up the hillside. Marius, sending officers to all parts, commanded 
<A NAME="589"></A>his men to stand still and keep their ground; when they came within reach, 
<A NAME="590"></A>to throw their javelins, then use their swords, and joining their shields, 
<A NAME="591"></A>force them back; pointing out to them that the steepness of the ground 
<A NAME="592"></A>would render the enemy's blows inefficient, nor could their shields be 
<A NAME="593"></A>kept close together, the inequality of the ground hindering the stability 
<A NAME="594"></A>of their footing.
<A NAME="595"></A><BR><BR>This counsel he gave them, and was the first that followed it; 
<A NAME="596"></A>for he was inferior to none in the use of his body, and far excelled all 
<A NAME="597"></A>in resolution. The Romans accordingly stood for their approach, and, checking 
<A NAME="598"></A>them in their advance upwards, forced them little by little to give way 
<A NAME="599"></A>and yield down the hill, and here, on the level ground, no sooner had the 
<A NAME="600"></A>Ambrones begun to restore their van into a posture of resistance, but they 
<A NAME="601"></A>found their rear disordered. For Marcellus had not let slip the opportunity; 
<A NAME="602"></A>but as soon as the shout was raised among the Romans on the hills, he, 
<A NAME="603"></A>setting his men in motion, fell in upon the enemy behind, at full speed, 
<A NAME="604"></A>and with loud cries, and routed those nearest him, and they, breaking the 
<A NAME="605"></A>ranks of those that were before them, filled the whole army with confusion. 
<A NAME="606"></A>They made no long resistance after they were thus broke in upon, but having 
<A NAME="607"></A>lost all order, fled.
<A NAME="608"></A><BR><BR>The Romans, pursuing them, slew and took prisoners above one hundred 
<A NAME="609"></A>thousand, and possessing themselves of their spoil, tents, and carriages, 
<A NAME="610"></A>voted all that was not purloined to Marius's share, which, though so magnificent 
<A NAME="611"></A>a present, yet was generally thought less than his conduct deserved in 
<A NAME="612"></A>so great a danger. Other authors give a different account, both about the 
<A NAME="613"></A>division of the plunder and the number of the slain. They say, however, 
<A NAME="614"></A>that the inhabitants of Massilia made fences round their vineyards with 
<A NAME="615"></A>the bones, and that the ground, enriched by the moisture of the putrefied 
<A NAME="616"></A>bodies (soaked with the rain of the following winter), yielded at the season 
<A NAME="617"></A>a prodigious crop, and fully justified Archilochus, who said, that the 
<A NAME="618"></A>fallows thus are fattened. It is an observation, also, that extraordinary 
<A NAME="619"></A>rains pretty generally fall after great battles; whether it be that some 
<A NAME="620"></A>divine power thus washes and cleanses the polluted earth with showers from 
<A NAME="621"></A>above, or that moist and heavy evaporations, steaming forth from the blood 
<A NAME="622"></A>and corruption, thicken the air, which naturally is subject to alteration 
<A NAME="623"></A>from the smallest causes.
<A NAME="624"></A><BR><BR>After the battle, Marius chose out from amongst the barbarians' 
<A NAME="625"></A>spoils and arms those that were whole and handsome, and that would make 
<A NAME="626"></A>the greatest show in his triumph; the rest he heaped upon a large pile, 
<A NAME="627"></A>and offered a very splendid sacrifice. Whilst the army stood round about 
<A NAME="628"></A>with their arms and garlands, himself attired (as the fashion is on such 
<A NAME="629"></A>occasions) in the purple-bordered robe, and taking a lighted torch, and 
<A NAME="630"></A>with both hands lifting it up towards heaven, he was then going to put 
<A NAME="631"></A>it to the pile, when some friends were espied with all haste coming towards 
<A NAME="632"></A>him on horseback. Upon which every one remained in silence and expectation. 
<A NAME="633"></A>They, upon their coming up, leapt off and saluted Marius, bringing him 
<A NAME="634"></A>the news of his fifth consulship, and delivered him letters to that effect. 
<A NAME="635"></A>This gave the addition of no small joy to the solemnity; and while the 
<A NAME="636"></A>soldiers clashed their arms and shouted, the officers again crowned Marius 
<A NAME="637"></A>with a laurel wreath, and he thus set fire to the pile, and finished his 
<A NAME="638"></A>sacrifice.
<A NAME="639"></A><BR><BR>But whatever it be which interferes to prevent the enjoyment of 
<A NAME="640"></A>prosperity ever being pure and sincere, and still diversifies human affairs 
<A NAME="641"></A>with the mixture of good and bad, whether fortune or divine displeasure, 
<A NAME="642"></A>or the necessity of the nature of things, within a few days Marius received 
<A NAME="643"></A>an account of his colleague, Catulus, which, as a cloud in serenity and 
<A NAME="644"></A>calm, terrified Rome with the apprehension of another imminent storm. Catulus, 
<A NAME="645"></A>who marched against the Cimbri, despairing of being able to defend the 
<A NAME="646"></A>passes of the Alps, lest, being compelled to divide his forces into several 
<A NAME="647"></A>parties, he should weaken himself, descended again into Italy, and posted 
<A NAME="648"></A>his army behind the river Adige; where he occupied the passages with strong 
<A NAME="649"></A>fortifications on both sides the river, and made a bridge, that so he might 
<A NAME="650"></A>cross to the assistance of his men on the other side, if so be the enemy, 
<A NAME="651"></A>having forced their way through the mountain passes, should storm the fortresses. 
<A NAME="652"></A>The barbarians, however, came on with such insolence and contempt of their 
<A NAME="653"></A>enemies, that to show their strength and courage, rather than out of any 
<A NAME="654"></A>necessity, they went naked in the showers of snow, and through the ice 
<A NAME="655"></A>and deep snow climbed up to the tops of the hills, and from thence, placing 
<A NAME="656"></A>their broad shields under their bodies, let themselves slide from the precipices 
<A NAME="657"></A>along their vast slippery descents.
<A NAME="658"></A><BR><BR>When they had pitched their camp at a little distance from the 
<A NAME="659"></A>river, and surveyed the passage, they began to pile it up, giant-like, 
<A NAME="660"></A>tearing down the neighbouring hills; and brought trees pulled up by the 
<A NAME="661"></A>roots, and heaps of earth to the river, damming up its course; and with 
<A NAME="662"></A>great heavy materials which they rolled down the stream and dashed against 
<A NAME="663"></A>the bridge, they forced away the beams which supported it; in consequence 
<A NAME="664"></A>of which the greatest part of the Roman soldiers, much affrighted, left 
<A NAME="665"></A>the camp and fled. Here Catulus showed himself a generous and noble general, 
<A NAME="666"></A>in preferring the glory of his people before his own; for when he could 
<A NAME="667"></A>not prevail with his soldiers to stand to their colours, but saw how they 
<A NAME="668"></A>all deserted them, he commanded his own standard to be taken up, and running 
<A NAME="669"></A>to the foremost of those that fled, he led them forward, choosing rather 
<A NAME="670"></A>that the disgrace should fall upon himself than upon his country, and that 
<A NAME="671"></A>they should not seem to fly, but, following their captain, to make a retreat. 
<A NAME="672"></A>The barbarians assaulted and took the fortress on the other side the Adige; 
<A NAME="673"></A>where much admiring the few Romans there left, who had shown extreme courage, 
<A NAME="674"></A>and had fought worthily of their country, they dismissed them upon terms, 
<A NAME="675"></A>swearing them upon their brazen bull, which was afterwards taken in the 
<A NAME="676"></A>battle, and carried, they say, to Catulus's house, as the chief trophy 
<A NAME="677"></A>of victory.
<A NAME="678"></A><BR><BR>Thus falling in upon the country destitute of defence, they wasted 
<A NAME="679"></A>it on all sides. Marius was presently sent for to the city; where, when 
<A NAME="680"></A>he arrived, every one supposing he would triumph, the senate, too, unanimously 
<A NAME="681"></A>voting it, he himself did not think it convenient: whether that he were 
<A NAME="682"></A>not willing to deprive his soldiers and officers of their share of the 
<A NAME="683"></A>glory, or that, to encourage the people in this juncture, he would leave 
<A NAME="684"></A>the honour due to his past victory on trust, as it were, in the hands of 
<A NAME="685"></A>the city and its future fortune; deferring it now to receive it afterwards 
<A NAME="686"></A>with the greater splendour. Having left such orders as the occasion required, 
<A NAME="687"></A>he hastened to Catulus, whose drooping spirits he much raised, and sent 
<A NAME="688"></A>for his own army from Gaul; and as soon as it came, passing the river Po, 
<A NAME="689"></A>he endeavoured to keep the barbarians out of that part of Italy which lies 
<A NAME="690"></A>south of it.
<A NAME="691"></A><BR><BR>They professed they were in expectation of the Teutones, and saying 
<A NAME="692"></A>they wondered they were so long in coming deferred the battle; either that 
<A NAME="693"></A>they were really ignorant of their defeat or were willing to seem so. For 
<A NAME="694"></A>they certainly much maltreated those that brought them such news, and, 
<A NAME="695"></A>sending to Marius, required some part of the country for themselves and 
<A NAME="696"></A>their brethren, and cities fit for them to inhabit. When Marius inquired 
<A NAME="697"></A>of the ambassadors who their brethren were, upon their saying the Teutones, 
<A NAME="698"></A>all that were present began to laugh; and Marius scoffingly answered them, 
<A NAME="699"></A>"Do not trouble yourself for your brethren, for we have already provided 
<A NAME="700"></A>lands for them, which they shall possess for ever." The ambassadors, understanding 
<A NAME="701"></A>the mockery, broke into insults, and threatened that the Cimbri would make 
<A NAME="702"></A>him pay for this and the Teutones, too, when they came. "They are not far 
<A NAME="703"></A>off," replied Marius, "and it will be unkindly done of you to go away before 
<A NAME="704"></A>greeting your brethren." Saying so, he commanded the kings of the Teutones 
<A NAME="705"></A>to be brought out, as they were, in chains; for they were taken by the 
<A NAME="706"></A>Sequani among the Alps, before they could make their escape. This was no 
<A NAME="707"></A>sooner made known to the Cimbri, but they with all expedition came against 
<A NAME="708"></A>Marius, who then lay still and guarded his camp.
<A NAME="709"></A><BR><BR>It is said that, against this battle Marius first altered the construction 
<A NAME="710"></A>of the Roman javelins. For before at the place where the wood was joined 
<A NAME="711"></A>to the iron it was made fast with two iron pins; but now Marius let one 
<A NAME="712"></A>of them alone as it was, and pulling out the other, put a weak wooden peg 
<A NAME="713"></A>in its place, thus contriving that when it was driven into the enemy's 
<A NAME="714"></A>shield, it should not stand right out, but the wooden peg breaking, the 
<A NAME="715"></A>iron should bend, and so the javelin should hold fast by its crooked point 
<A NAME="716"></A>and drag. Boeorix, King of the Cimbri, came with a small party of horse 
<A NAME="717"></A>to the Roman camp, and challenged Marius to appoint the time and place 
<A NAME="718"></A>where they might meet and fight for the country. Marius answered that the 
<A NAME="719"></A>Romans never consulted their enemies when to fight, however, he would gratify 
<A NAME="720"></A>the Cimbri so far; and so they fixed upon the third day after and for the 
<A NAME="721"></A>place, the plain near Vercellae, which was convenient enough for the Roman 
<A NAME="722"></A>horse, and afforded room for the enemy to display their 
<A NAME="723"></A>numbers.
<A NAME="724"></A><BR><BR>They observed the time appointed, and drew out their forces against 
<A NAME="725"></A>each other. Catulus commanded twenty thousand three hundred, and Marius 
<A NAME="726"></A>thirty-two thousand, who were placed in the two wings, leaving Catulus 
<A NAME="727"></A>the centre. Sylla, who was present at the fight, gives this account; saying, 
<A NAME="728"></A>also, that Marius drew up his army in this order, because he expected that 
<A NAME="729"></A>the armies would meet on the wings since it generally happens that in such 
<A NAME="730"></A>extensive fronts the centre falls back, and thus he would have the whole 
<A NAME="731"></A>victory to himself and his soldiers, and Catulus would not be even engaged. 
<A NAME="732"></A>They tell us, also, that Catulus himself alleged this in vindication of 
<A NAME="733"></A>his honour, accusing, in various ways, the enviousness of Marius. The infantry 
<A NAME="734"></A>of the Cimbri marched quietly out of their fortifications, having their 
<A NAME="735"></A>flanks equal to their front; every side of the army taking up thirty furlongs. 
<A NAME="736"></A>Their horse, that were in number fifteen thousand, made a very splendid 
<A NAME="737"></A>appearance. They wore helmets, made to resemble the head and jaws of wild 
<A NAME="738"></A>beasts, and other strange shapes, and heightening these with plumes of 
<A NAME="739"></A>feathers, they made themselves appear taller than they were. They had breastplates 
<A NAME="740"></A>of iron and white glittering shields; and for their offensive arms every 
<A NAME="741"></A>one had two darts, and when they came hand to hand, they used large and 
<A NAME="742"></A>heavy swords.
<A NAME="743"></A><BR><BR>The cavalry did not fall directly upon the front of the Romans, 
<A NAME="744"></A>but, turning to the right, they endeavoured to draw them on in that direction 
<A NAME="745"></A>by little and little, so as to get them between themselves and their infantry, 
<A NAME="746"></A>who were placed in the left wing. The Roman commanders soon perceived the 
<A NAME="747"></A>design, but could not contain the soldiers; for one happening to shout 
<A NAME="748"></A>out that the enemy fled, they all rushed to pursue them, while the whole 
<A NAME="749"></A>barbarian foot came on, moving like a great ocean. Here Marius, having 
<A NAME="750"></A>washed his hands, and lifting them up towards heaven, vowed an hecatomb 
<A NAME="751"></A>to the gods; and Catulus, too, in the same posture, solemnly promised to 
<A NAME="752"></A>consecrate a temple to the "Fortune of that day." They say, too, that Marius, 
<A NAME="753"></A>having the victim shown to him as he was sacrificing, cried out with a 
<A NAME="754"></A>loud voice, "The victory is mine."
<A NAME="755"></A><BR><BR>However, in the engagement, according to the accounts of Sylla 
<A NAME="756"></A>and his friends, Marius met with what might be called a mark of divine 
<A NAME="757"></A>displeasure. For a great dust being raised, which (as it might very probably 
<A NAME="758"></A>happen) almost covered both the armies, he, leading on his forces to the 
<A NAME="759"></A>pursuit, missed the enemy, and having passed by their array, moved for 
<A NAME="760"></A>a good space, up and down the field; meanwhile the enemy, by chance, engaged 
<A NAME="761"></A>with Catulus, and the heat of the battle was chiefly with him and his men, 
<A NAME="762"></A>among whom Sylla says he was; adding, that the Romans had great advantage 
<A NAME="763"></A>of the heat and sun that shone in the faces of the Cimbri. For they, well 
<A NAME="764"></A>able to endure cold, and having been bred up (as we observed before) in 
<A NAME="765"></A>cold and shady countries, were overcome with the excessive heat; they sweated 
<A NAME="766"></A>extremely, and were much out of breath, being forced to hold their shields 
<A NAME="767"></A>before their faces; for the battle was fought not long after the summer 
<A NAME="768"></A>solstice, or, as the Romans reckon, upon the third day before the new moon 
<A NAME="769"></A>of the month now called August and then Sextilis. The dust, too, gave the 
<A NAME="770"></A>Romans no small addition to their courage, inasmuch as it hid the enemy. 
<A NAME="771"></A>For afar off they could not discover their number; but every one advancing 
<A NAME="772"></A>to encounter those that were nearest to them, came to fight hand to hand 
<A NAME="773"></A>before the sight of so vast a multitude had struck terror into them. They 
<A NAME="774"></A>were so much used to labour, and so well exercised, that in all the heat 
<A NAME="775"></A>and toil of the encounter, not one of them was observed either to sweat 
<A NAME="776"></A>or to be out of breath; so much so, that Catulus himself, they say, recorded 
<A NAME="777"></A>it in commendation of his soldiers.
<A NAME="778"></A><BR><BR>Here the greatest part and most valiant of the enemies were cut 
<A NAME="779"></A>in pieces; for those that fought in the front, that they might not break 
<A NAME="780"></A>their ranks, were fast tied to one another, with long chains put through 
<A NAME="781"></A>their belts. But as they pursued those that fled to their camp they witnessed 
<A NAME="782"></A>a most fearful tragedy; the women, standing in black clothes on their wagons, 
<A NAME="783"></A>slew all that fled, some their husbands, some their brethren, others their 
<A NAME="784"></A>fathers; and strangling their little children with their own hands, threw 
<A NAME="785"></A>them under the wheels and the feet of the cattle, and then killed themselves. 
<A NAME="786"></A>They tell of one who hung herself from the end of the pole of a wagon, 
<A NAME="787"></A>with her children tied dangling at her heels. The men, for want of trees, 
<A NAME="788"></A>tied themselves, some to the horns of the oxen, others by the neck to their 
<A NAME="789"></A>legs, that so pricking them on, by the starting and springing of the beasts, 
<A NAME="790"></A>they might be torn and trodden to pieces. Yet for all they thus massacred 
<A NAME="791"></A>themselves, above sixty thousand were taken prisoners, and those that were 
<A NAME="792"></A>slain were said to be twice as many.
<A NAME="793"></A><BR><BR>The ordinary plunder was taken by Marius's soldiers, but the other 
<A NAME="794"></A>spoils, as ensigns, trumpets, and the like, they say, were brought to Catulus's 
<A NAME="795"></A>camp; which he used for the best argument that the victory was obtained 
<A NAME="796"></A>by himself and his army. Some dissensions arising, as was natural, among 
<A NAME="797"></A>the soldiers, the deputies from Parma, being then present, were made judges 
<A NAME="798"></A>of the controversy; whom Catulus's men carried about among their slain 
<A NAME="799"></A>enemies and manifestly showed them that they were slain by their javelins, 
<A NAME="800"></A>which were known by the inscriptions, having Catulus's name cut in the 
<A NAME="801"></A>wood. Nevertheless the whole glory of the action was ascribed to Marius, 
<A NAME="802"></A>on account of his former victory, and under colour of his present authority; 
<A NAME="803"></A>the populace more especially styling him the third founder of their city, 
<A NAME="804"></A>as having diverted a danger no less threatening than was that when the 
<A NAME="805"></A>Gauls sacked Rome; and every one, in their feasts and rejoicings at home 
<A NAME="806"></A>with their wives and children, made offerings and libations in honour of 
<A NAME="807"></A>"The Gods and Marius;" and would have had him solely have the honour of 
<A NAME="808"></A>both the triumphs. However, he did not do so, but triumphed together with 
<A NAME="809"></A>Catulus, being desirous to show his moderation even in such great circumstances 
<A NAME="810"></A>of good fortune; besides he was not a little afraid of the soldiers in 
<A NAME="811"></A>Catulus's army, lest, if he should wholly bereave their general of the 
<A NAME="812"></A>honour, they should endeavour to hinder him of his triumph.
<A NAME="813"></A><BR><BR>Marius was now in his fifth consulship, and he sued for his sixth 
<A NAME="814"></A>in such a manner as never any man before him had done, even for his first; 
<A NAME="815"></A>he courted the people's favour and ingratiated himself with the multitude 
<A NAME="816"></A>by every sort of complaisance; not only derogating from the state and dignity 
<A NAME="817"></A>of his office, but also belying his own character, by attempting to seem 
<A NAME="818"></A>popular and obliging, for which nature had never designed him. His passion 
<A NAME="819"></A>for distinction did, indeed, they say, make him exceedingly timorous in 
<A NAME="820"></A>any political matters, or in confronting public assemblies; and that undaunted 
<A NAME="821"></A>presence of mind he always showed in battle against the enemy forsook him 
<A NAME="822"></A>when he was to address the people; he was easily upset by the most ordinary 
<A NAME="823"></A>commendation or dispraise. It is told of him, that having at one time given 
<A NAME="824"></A>the freedom of the city to one thousand men of Camerinum who had behaved 
<A NAME="825"></A>valiantly in this war, and this seeming to be illegally done, upon some 
<A NAME="826"></A>one or other calling him to an account for it, he answered, that the law 
<A NAME="827"></A>spoke too softly to be heard in such a noise of war; yet he himself appeared 
<A NAME="828"></A>to be more disconcerted and overcome by the clamour made in the assemblies. 
<A NAME="829"></A>The need they had of him in time of war procured him power and dignity; 
<A NAME="830"></A>but in civil affairs, when he despaired of getting the first place, he 
<A NAME="831"></A>was forced to betake himself to the favour of the people, never caring 
<A NAME="832"></A>to be a good man so that he were but a great one.
<A NAME="833"></A><BR><BR>He thus became very odious to all the nobility; and above all, 
<A NAME="834"></A>he feared Metellus, who had been so ungratefully used by him, and whose 
<A NAME="835"></A>true virtue made him naturally an enemy to those that sought influence 
<A NAME="836"></A>with the people, not by the honourable course, but by subservience and 
<A NAME="837"></A>complaisance. Marius, therefore, endeavoured to banish him from the city, 
<A NAME="838"></A>and for this purpose he contracted a close alliance with Glaucia and Saturninus 
<A NAME="839"></A>a couple of daring fellows, who had the great mass of the indigent and 
<A NAME="840"></A>seditious multitude at their control; and by their assistance he enacted 
<A NAME="841"></A>various laws, and bringing the soldiers, also, to attend the assembly, 
<A NAME="842"></A>he was enabled to overpower Metellus. And as Rutilius relates (in all other 
<A NAME="843"></A>respects a fair and faithful authority, but, indeed, privately an enemy 
<A NAME="844"></A>to Marius), he obtained his sixth consulship by distributing vast sums 
<A NAME="845"></A>of money among the tribes, and by this bribery kept out Metellus, and had 
<A NAME="846"></A>Valerius Flaccus given him as his instrument, rather than his colleague, 
<A NAME="847"></A>in the consulship. The people had never before bestowed so many consulships 
<A NAME="848"></A>on any one man, except on Valerius Corvinus only, and he, too, they say, 
<A NAME="849"></A>was forty-five years between his first and last; but Marius, from his first, 
<A NAME="850"></A>ran through five more, with one current of good fortune.
<A NAME="851"></A><BR><BR>In the last, especially, he contracted a great deal of hatred, 
<A NAME="852"></A>by committing several gross misdemeanours in compliance with the desires 
<A NAME="853"></A>of Saturninus; among which was the murder of Nonius whom Saturninus slew 
<A NAME="854"></A>because he stood in competition with him for the tribuneship. And when, 
<A NAME="855"></A>afterwards, Saturninus, on becoming tribune, brought forward his law for 
<A NAME="856"></A>the division of lands, with a clause enacting that the senate publicly 
<A NAME="857"></A>swear to confirm whatever the people should vote, and not to oppose them 
<A NAME="858"></A>in anything, Marius, in the senate, cunningly feigned to be against this 
<A NAME="859"></A>provision, and said that he would not take any such oath, nor would any 
<A NAME="860"></A>man, he thought, who was wise; for if there were no ill design in the law, 
<A NAME="861"></A>still it would be an affront to the senate to be compelled to give their 
<A NAME="862"></A>approbation, and not to do it willingly and upon persuasion. This he said, 
<A NAME="863"></A>not that it was agreeable to his own sentiments, but that he might entrap 
<A NAME="864"></A>Metellus beyond any possibility of escape. For Marius, in whose ideas virtue 
<A NAME="865"></A>and capacity consisted largely in deceit, made very little account of what 
<A NAME="866"></A>he had openly professed to the senate; and knowing that Metellus was one 
<A NAME="867"></A>of a fixed resolution, and, as Pindar has it, esteemed "truth the first 
<A NAME="868"></A>principle of heroic virtue," he hoped to ensnare him into a declaration 
<A NAME="869"></A>before the senate, and on his refusing, as he was sure to do, afterwards 
<A NAME="870"></A>to take the oath, he expected to bring him into such odium with the people 
<A NAME="871"></A>as should never be wiped off. The design succeeded to his wish. As soon 
<A NAME="872"></A>as Metellus had declared that he would not swear to it, the senate adjourned. 
<A NAME="873"></A>A few days after on Saturninus citing the senators to make their appearance, 
<A NAME="874"></A>and take the oath before the people, Marius stepped forth amidst a profound 
<A NAME="875"></A>silence, every one being intent to hear him, and bidding farewell to those 
<A NAME="876"></A>fine speeches he had before made in the senate, said, that his back was 
<A NAME="877"></A>not so broad that he should think himself bound, once for all, by any opinion 
<A NAME="878"></A>once given on so important a matter; he would willingly swear and submit 
<A NAME="879"></A>to the law, if so be it were one, a proviso which he added as a mere cover 
<A NAME="880"></A>for his effrontery. The people, in great joy at his taking the oath, loudly 
<A NAME="881"></A>clapped and applauded him, while the nobility stood by ashamed and vexed 
<A NAME="882"></A>at his inconstancy; but they submitted out of fear of the people, and all 
<A NAME="883"></A>in order took the oath, till it came to Metellus's turn. But he, though 
<A NAME="884"></A>his friends begged and entreated him to take it, and not to plunge himself 
<A NAME="885"></A>irrecoverably into the penalties which Saturninus had provided for those 
<A NAME="886"></A>that should refuse it, would not flinch from his resolution, nor swear; 
<A NAME="887"></A>but, according to his fixed custom, being ready to suffer anything rather 
<A NAME="888"></A>than do a base, unworthy action, he left the forum, telling those that 
<A NAME="889"></A>were with him that to do wrong things is base, and to do well where there 
<A NAME="890"></A>is no danger, common; the good man's characteristic is to do so where there 
<A NAME="891"></A>is danger.
<A NAME="892"></A><BR><BR>Hereupon Saturninus put it to the vote, that the consuls should 
<A NAME="893"></A>place Metellus under their interdict, and forbid him fire, water, and lodging. 
<A NAME="894"></A>There were enough, too, of the basest of people ready to kill him. Nevertheless, 
<A NAME="895"></A>when many of the better sort were extremely concerned, and gathered about 
<A NAME="896"></A>Metellus, he would not suffer them to raise a sedition upon his account, 
<A NAME="897"></A>but with this calm reflection left the city, "Either when the posture of 
<A NAME="898"></A>affairs is mended and the people repent, I shall be recalled, or if things 
<A NAME="899"></A>remain in their present condition, it will be best to be absent." But what 
<A NAME="900"></A>great favour and honour Metellus received in his banishment, and in what 
<A NAME="901"></A>manner he spent his time at Rhodes, in philosophy, will be more fitly our 
<A NAME="902"></A>subject when we write his life.
<A NAME="903"></A><BR><BR>Marius, in return for this piece of service, was forced to connive 
<A NAME="904"></A>at Saturninus now proceeding to the very height of insolence and violence, 
<A NAME="905"></A>and was, without knowing it, the instrument of mischief beyond endurance, 
<A NAME="906"></A>the only course of which was through outrages and massacres to tyranny 
<A NAME="907"></A>and the subversion of the government. Standing in some awe of the nobility, 
<A NAME="908"></A>and, at the same time, eager to court the commonalty, he was guilty of 
<A NAME="909"></A>a most mean and dishonest action. When some of the great men came to him 
<A NAME="910"></A>at night to stir him up against Saturninus, at the other door, unknown 
<A NAME="911"></A>to them, he let him in; then making the same pretence of some disorder 
<A NAME="912"></A>of body to both, he ran from one party to the other, and staying at one 
<A NAME="913"></A>time with them and another with him, he instigated and exasperated them 
<A NAME="914"></A>one against another. At length when the senate and equestrian order concerted 
<A NAME="915"></A>measures together, and openly manifested their resentment, he did bring 
<A NAME="916"></A>his soldiers into the forum, and driving the insurgents into the capitol, 
<A NAME="917"></A>and then cutting off the conduits, forced them to surrender by want of 
<A NAME="918"></A>water. They, in this distress, addressing themselves to him, surrendered, 
<A NAME="919"></A>at it is termed, on the public faith. He did his utmost to save their lives, 
<A NAME="920"></A>but so wholly in vain, that when they came down into the forum they were 
<A NAME="921"></A>all basely murdered. Thus he had made himself equally odious both to the 
<A NAME="922"></A>nobility and commons, and when the time was come to create censors, though 
<A NAME="923"></A>he was the most obvious man, yet he did not petition for it; but fearing 
<A NAME="924"></A>the disgrace of being repulsed, permitted others, his inferiors, to be 
<A NAME="925"></A>elected, though he pleased himself by giving out that he was not willing 
<A NAME="926"></A>to disoblige too many by undertaking a severe inspection into their lives 
<A NAME="927"></A>and conduct.
<A NAME="928"></A><BR><BR>There was now an edict preferred to recall Metellus from banishment; 
<A NAME="929"></A>this he vigorously, but in vain, opposed both by word and deed, and was 
<A NAME="930"></A>at length obliged to desist. The people unanimously voted for it; and he, 
<A NAME="931"></A>not able to endure the sight of Metellus's return, made a voyage to Cappadocia 
<A NAME="932"></A>and Galatia; giving out that he had to perform the sacrifices which he 
<A NAME="933"></A>had vowed to Cybele; but actuated really by other less apparent reasons. 
<A NAME="934"></A>For, in fact, being a man altogether ignorant of civil life and ordinary 
<A NAME="935"></A>politics, he received all his advancement from war; and supposing his power 
<A NAME="936"></A>and glory would by little and little decrease by his lying quietly out 
<A NAME="937"></A>of action, he was eager by every means to excite some new commotions, and 
<A NAME="938"></A>hoped that by setting at variance some of the kings, and by exasperating 
<A NAME="939"></A>Mithridates, especially, who was then apparently making preparations for 
<A NAME="940"></A>war, he himself should be chosen general against him, and so furnish the 
<A NAME="941"></A>city with new matter of triumph, and his own house with the plunder of 
<A NAME="942"></A>Pontus and the riches of its king. Therefore, though Mithridates entertained 
<A NAME="943"></A>him with all imaginable attention and respect, yet he was not at all wrought 
<A NAME="944"></A>upon or softened by it; but said, "O king, either endeavour to be stronger 
<A NAME="945"></A>than the Romans, or else quietly submit to their commands." With which 
<A NAME="946"></A>he left Mithridates as he indeed had often heard the fame of the bold speaking 
<A NAME="947"></A>of the Romans, but now for the first time experienced 
<A NAME="948"></A>it.
<A NAME="949"></A><BR><BR>When Marius returned again to Rome, he built a house close by the 
<A NAME="950"></A>forum, either, as he himself gave out, that he was not willing his clients 
<A NAME="951"></A>should be tried with going far, or that he imagined distance was the reason 
<A NAME="952"></A>why more did not come. This, however, was not so; the real reason was, 
<A NAME="953"></A>that, being inferior to others in agreeableness of conversation and the 
<A NAME="954"></A>arts of political life, like a mere tool and implement of war, he was thrown 
<A NAME="955"></A>aside in time of peace. Amongst all those whose brightness eclipsed his 
<A NAME="956"></A>glory, he was most incensed against Sylla, who had owed his rise to the 
<A NAME="957"></A>hatred which the nobility bore Marius; and had made his disagreement with 
<A NAME="958"></A>him the one principle of his political life. When Bocchus, King of Numidia, 
<A NAME="959"></A>who was styled the associate of the Romans, dedicated some figures of Victory 
<A NAME="960"></A>in the capitol, and with them a representation in gold of himself delivering 
<A NAME="961"></A>Jugurtha to Sylla, Marius upon this was almost distracted with rage and 
<A NAME="962"></A>ambition, as though Sylla had arrogated this honour to himself, and endeavoured 
<A NAME="963"></A>forcibly to pull down these presents; Sylla, on the other side, as vigorously 
<A NAME="964"></A>resisted him; but the Social War, then on a sudden threatening the city, 
<A NAME="965"></A>put a stop to this sedition when just ready to break out. For the most 
<A NAME="966"></A>warlike and best-peopled countries of all Italy formed a confederacy together 
<A NAME="967"></A>against Rome, and were within a little of subverting the empire; as they 
<A NAME="968"></A>were indeed strong, not only in their weapons and the valour of their soldiers, 
<A NAME="969"></A>but stood nearly upon equal terms with the Romans as to the skill and daring 
<A NAME="970"></A>of their commanders.
<A NAME="971"></A><BR><BR>As much glory and power as this war, so various in its events and 
<A NAME="972"></A>so uncertain as to its success, conferred upon Sylla, so much it took away 
<A NAME="973"></A>from Marius, who was thought tardy, unenterprising, and timid, whether 
<A NAME="974"></A>it were that his age was now quenching his former heat and vigour (for 
<A NAME="975"></A>he was above sixty-five years old), or that having, as he himself said, 
<A NAME="976"></A>some distemper that affected his muscles, and his body being unfit for 
<A NAME="977"></A>action, he did service above his strength. Yet, for all this, he came off 
<A NAME="978"></A>victor in a considerable battle, wherein he slew six thousand of the enemies, 
<A NAME="979"></A>and never once gave them any advantage over him; and when he was surrounded 
<A NAME="980"></A>by the works of the enemy, he contained himself, and though insulted over, 
<A NAME="981"></A>and challenged, did not yield to the provocation. The story is told that 
<A NAME="982"></A>when Publius Silo, a man of the greatest repute and authority among the 
<A NAME="983"></A>enemies, said to him, "If you are indeed a great general, Marius, leave 
<A NAME="984"></A>your camp and fight a battle," he replied, "If you are one, make me do 
<A NAME="985"></A>so." And another time, when the enemy gave them a good opportunity of a 
<A NAME="986"></A>battle, and the Romans through fear durst not charge, so that both parties 
<A NAME="987"></A>retreated, he called an assembly of his soldiers, and said, "It is no small 
<A NAME="988"></A>question whether I should call the enemies or you the greater cowards, 
<A NAME="989"></A>for neither did they dare to face your backs, nor you to confront theirs." 
<A NAME="990"></A>At length, professing to be worn out with the infirmity of his body, he 
<A NAME="991"></A>laid down his command.
<A NAME="992"></A><BR><BR>Afterwards when the Italians were worsted, there were several candidates 
<A NAME="993"></A>suing with the aid of the popular leaders for the chief command in the 
<A NAME="994"></A>war with Mithridates. Sulpicius, tribune of the people, a bold and confident 
<A NAME="995"></A>man, contrary to everybody's expectation, brought forward Marius, and proposed 
<A NAME="996"></A>him as proconsul and general in that war. The people were divided; some 
<A NAME="997"></A>were on Marius's side, others voted for Sylla, and jeeringly bade Marius 
<A NAME="998"></A>go to the baths at Baiae, to cure his body, worn out, as himself confessed, 
<A NAME="999"></A>with age and catarrhs. Marius had indeed, there, about Misenum, a villa 
<A NAME="1000"></A>more effeminately and luxuriously furnished than seemed to become one that 
<A NAME="1001"></A>had seen service in so many and great wars and expeditions. This same house 
<A NAME="1002"></A>Cornelia bought for seventy-five thousand drachmas, and not long after 
<A NAME="1003"></A>Lucius Lucullus, for two million five hundred thousand; so rapid and so 
<A NAME="1004"></A>great was the growth of Roman sumptuosity. Yet, in spite of all this, out 
<A NAME="1005"></A>of a mere boyish passion for distinction, affecting to shake off his age 
<A NAME="1006"></A>and weakness, he went down daily to the Campus Martius, and exercising 
<A NAME="1007"></A>himself with the youth, showed himself still nimble in his armour, and 
<A NAME="1008"></A>expert in riding; though he was undoubtedly grown bulky in his old age, 
<A NAME="1009"></A>and inclining to excessive faintness and corpulency.
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR><BR>Some people were pleased with this, and went continually to see 
<A NAME="1011"></A>him competing and displaying himself in these exercises; but the better 
<A NAME="1012"></A>sort that saw him pitied the cupidity and ambition that made one who had 
<A NAME="1013"></A>risen from utter poverty to extreme wealth, and out of nothing into greatness, 
<A NAME="1014"></A>unwilling to admit any limit to his high fortune, or to be content with 
<A NAME="1015"></A>being admired, and quietly enjoying what he had already got; why, as if 
<A NAME="1016"></A>he still were indigent, should he at so great an age leave his glory and 
<A NAME="1017"></A>his triumphs to go into Cappadocia and the Euxine Sea, to fight Archelaus 
<A NAME="1018"></A>and Neoptolemus, Mithridates's generals? Marius's pretences for this action 
<A NAME="1019"></A>of his seemed very ridiculous; for he said he wanted to go and teach his 
<A NAME="1020"></A>son to be a general.
<A NAME="1021"></A><BR><BR>The condition of the city, which had long been unsound and diseased 
<A NAME="1022"></A>became hopeless now that Marius found so opportune an instrument for the 
<A NAME="1023"></A>public destruction as Sulpicius's insolence. This man professed, in all 
<A NAME="1024"></A>other respects, to admire and imitate Saturninus; only he found fault with 
<A NAME="1025"></A>him for backwardness and want of spirit in his designs. He, therefore, 
<A NAME="1026"></A>to avoid this fault, got six hundred of the equestrian order about him 
<A NAME="1027"></A>as his guard, whom he named anti-senators; and with these confederates 
<A NAME="1028"></A>he set upon the consuls, whilst they were at the assembly, and took the 
<A NAME="1029"></A>son of one of them who fled from the forum and slew him. Sylla, being hotly 
<A NAME="1030"></A>pursued, took refuge in Marius's house, which none could suspect, by that 
<A NAME="1031"></A>means escaping those that sought him, who hastily passed by there, and, 
<A NAME="1032"></A>it is said, was safely conveyed by Marius himself out at the other door, 
<A NAME="1033"></A>and came to the camp. Yet Sylla, in his memoirs, positively denies that 
<A NAME="1034"></A>he fled to Marius, saying he was carried thither to consult upon the matters 
<A NAME="1035"></A>to which Sulpicius would have forced him, against his will, to consent; 
<A NAME="1036"></A>that he, surrounding him with drawn swords, hurried him to Marius, and 
<A NAME="1037"></A>constrained him thus, till he went thence to the forum and removed, as 
<A NAME="1038"></A>they required him to do, the interdict on business.
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR><BR>Sulpicius, having thus obtained the mastery, decreed the command 
<A NAME="1040"></A>of the army to Marius, who proceeded to make preparations for his march, 
<A NAME="1041"></A>and sent two tribunes to receive the charge of the army from Sylla. Sylla 
<A NAME="1042"></A>hereupon exasperating his soldiers, who were about thirty-five thousand 
<A NAME="1043"></A>full-armed men, led them towards Rome. First falling upon the tribunes 
<A NAME="1044"></A>Marius had sent, they slew them; Marius having done as much for several 
<A NAME="1045"></A>of Sylla's friends in Rome, and now offering their freedom to the slaves 
<A NAME="1046"></A>on condition of their assistance in the war; of whom, however, they say, 
<A NAME="1047"></A>there were but three who accepted his proposal. For some small time he 
<A NAME="1048"></A>made head against Sylla's assault, but was soon overpowered and fled; those 
<A NAME="1049"></A>that were with him, as soon as he had escaped out of the city, were dispersed, 
<A NAME="1050"></A>and night coming on, he hastened to a country-house of his, called Solonium. 
<A NAME="1051"></A>Hence he sent his son to some neighbouring farms of his father-in-law, 
<A NAME="1052"></A>Mucius, to provide necessaries; he went himself to Ostia, where his friend 
<A NAME="1053"></A>Numerius had prepared him a ship, and hence, not staying for his son, he 
<A NAME="1054"></A>took with him his son-in-law Granius, and weighed anchor.
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR><BR>Young Marius, coming to Mucius's farms, made his preparations; 
<A NAME="1056"></A>and the day breaking, was almost discovered by the enemy. For there came 
<A NAME="1057"></A>thither a party of horse that suspected some such matter; but the farm 
<A NAME="1058"></A>steward, foreseeing their approach, hid Marius in a cart full of beans, 
<A NAME="1059"></A>then yoking in his team and driving toward the city, met those that were 
<A NAME="1060"></A>in search of him. Marius, thus conveyed home to his wife, took with him 
<A NAME="1061"></A>some necessaries, and came at night to the seaside; where, going on board 
<A NAME="1062"></A>a ship that was bound for Africa, he went away thither. Marius, the father, 
<A NAME="1063"></A>when he had put to sea, with a strong gale passing along the coast of Italy, 
<A NAME="1064"></A>was in no small apprehension of one Geminius, a great man at Terracina, 
<A NAME="1065"></A>and his enemy; and therefore bade the seamen hold off from that place. 
<A NAME="1066"></A>They were indeed willing to gratify him, but the wind now blowing in from 
<A NAME="1067"></A>the sea and making the waves swell to a great height, they were afraid 
<A NAME="1068"></A>the ship would not be able to weather out the storm, and Marius, too, being 
<A NAME="1069"></A>indisposed and sea-sick, they made for land, and not without some difficulty 
<A NAME="1070"></A>reached the shore near Circeium.
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR><BR>The storm now increasing and their victuals failing, they left 
<A NAME="1072"></A>their ship, and wandered up and down without any certain purpose, simply 
<A NAME="1073"></A>as in great distresses people shun the present as the greatest evil, and 
<A NAME="1074"></A>rely upon the hopes of uncertainties. For the land and sea were both equally 
<A NAME="1075"></A>unsafe for them; it was dangerous to meet with people, and it was no less 
<A NAME="1076"></A>so to meet with none, on account of their want of necessaries. At length, 
<A NAME="1077"></A>though late, they lighted upon a few poor shepherds, that had not anything 
<A NAME="1078"></A>to relieve them; but knowing Marius, advised him to depart as soon as might 
<A NAME="1079"></A>he, for they had seen a little beyond that place a party of horse that 
<A NAME="1080"></A>were gone in search of him. Finding himself in a great strait, especially 
<A NAME="1081"></A>because those that attended him were not able to go further, being spent 
<A NAME="1082"></A>with their long fasting, for the present he turned aside out of the road, 
<A NAME="1083"></A>and hid himself in a
