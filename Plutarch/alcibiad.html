<BR>(died 404 B.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Alcibiades, as it is supposed, was anciently descended from Eurysaces, 
<A NAME="11"></A>the son of Ajax, by his father's side; and by his mother's side from Alcmaeon. 
<A NAME="12"></A>Dinomache, his mother, was the daughter of Megacles. His father, Clinias, 
<A NAME="13"></A>having fitted out a galley at his own expense, gained great honour in the 
<A NAME="14"></A>sea-fight at Artemisium, and was afterwards slain in the battle of Coronea, 
<A NAME="15"></A>fighting against the Boeotians. Pericles and Ariphron, the sons of Xanthippus, 
<A NAME="16"></A>nearly related to him, became the guardians of Alcibiades. It has been 
<A NAME="17"></A>said not untruly that the friendship which Socrates felt for him has much 
<A NAME="18"></A>contributed to his fame; and certain it is, that, though we have no account 
<A NAME="19"></A>from any writer concerning the mother of Nicias or Demosthenes, of Lamachus 
<A NAME="20"></A>or Phormion, of Thrasybulus or Theramenes, notwithstanding these were all 
<A NAME="21"></A>illustrious men of the same period, yet we know even the nurse of Alcibiades, 
<A NAME="22"></A>that her country was Lacedaemon, and her name Amycla; and that Zopyrus 
<A NAME="23"></A>was his teacher and attendant; the one being recorded by Antisthenes, and 
<A NAME="24"></A>the other by Plato.
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><BR>It is not, perhaps, material to say anything of the beauty of Alcibiades, 
<A NAME="26"></A>only that it bloomed with him in all the ages of his life, in his infancy, 
<A NAME="27"></A>in his youth, and in his manhood; and, in the peculiar character becoming 
<A NAME="28"></A>to each of these periods, gave him, in every one of them, a grace and a 
<A NAME="29"></A>charm. What Euripides says, that-
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>"Of all fair things the autumn, too, is fair," is by no means universally 
<A NAME="31"></A>true. But it happened so with Alcibiades, amongst few others, by reason 
<A NAME="32"></A>of his happy constitution and natural vigour of body. It is said that his 
<A NAME="33"></A>lisping, when he spoke, became him well, and gave a grace and persuasiveness 
<A NAME="34"></A>to his rapid speech. Aristophanes takes notice of it in the verses in which 
<A NAME="35"></A>he jests at Theorus; "How like a colax he is," says Alcibiades, meaning 
<A NAME="36"></A>a corax; on which it is remarked,-
<A NAME="37"></A><BR><BR>"How very happily he lisped the truth." Archippus also alludes 
<A NAME="38"></A>to it in a passage where he ridicules the son of Alcibiades:-
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR>"That people may believe him like his father,
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>He walks like one dissolved in luxury,
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>Lets his robe trail behind him on the ground,
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>Carelessly leans his head, and in his talk
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>Affects to lisp."
<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR>His conduct displayed many great inconsistencies and variations, 
<A NAME="45"></A>not unnaturally, in accordance with the many and wonderful vicissitudes 
<A NAME="46"></A>of his fortunes; but among the many strong passions of his real character, 
<A NAME="47"></A>the one most prevailing of all was his ambition and desire of superiority, 
<A NAME="48"></A>which appears in several anecdotes told of his sayings whilst he was a 
<A NAME="49"></A>child. Once being hard pressed in wrestling, and fearing to be thrown, 
<A NAME="50"></A>he got the hand of his antagonist to his mouth, and bit it with all his 
<A NAME="51"></A>force; and when the other loosed his hold presently, and said, "You bite, 
<A NAME="52"></A>Alcibiades, like a woman." "No," replied he, "like a lion." Another time 
<A NAME="53"></A>as he played at dice in the street, being then but a child, a loaded cart 
<A NAME="54"></A>came that way, when it was his turn to throw; at first he called to the 
<A NAME="55"></A>driver to stop, because he was to throw in the way over which the cart 
<A NAME="56"></A>was to pass; but the man giving him no attention and driving on, when the 
<A NAME="57"></A>rest of the boys divided and gave way, Alcibiades threw himself on his 
<A NAME="58"></A>face before the cart and, stretching himself out, bade the carter pass 
<A NAME="59"></A>on now if he would; which so startled the man, that he put back his horses, 
<A NAME="60"></A>while all that saw it were terrified, and, crying out, ran to assist Alcibiades. 
<A NAME="61"></A>When he began to study, he obeyed all his other masters fairly well, but 
<A NAME="62"></A>refused to learn upon the flute, as a sordid thing, and not becoming a 
<A NAME="63"></A>free citizen; saying that to play on the lute or the harp does not in any 
<A NAME="64"></A>way disfigure a man's body or face, but one is hardly to be known by the 
<A NAME="65"></A>most intimate friends when playing on the flute. Besides, one who plays 
<A NAME="66"></A>on the harp may speak or sing at the same time; but the use of the flute 
<A NAME="67"></A>stops the mouth, intercepts the voice, and prevents all articulation. "Therefore," 
<A NAME="68"></A>said he, "let the Theban youths pipe, who do not know how to speak, but 
<A NAME="69"></A>we Athenians, as our ancestors have told us, have Minerva for our patroness, 
<A NAME="70"></A>and Apollo for our protector, one of whom threw away the flute, and the 
<A NAME="71"></A>other stripped the Flute-player of his skin." Thus, between raillery and 
<A NAME="72"></A>good earnest, Alcibiades kept not only himself but others from learning, 
<A NAME="73"></A>as it presently became the talk of the young boys, how Alcibiades despised 
<A NAME="74"></A>playing on the flute, and ridiculed those who studied it. In consequence 
<A NAME="75"></A>of which, it ceased to be reckoned amongst the liberal accomplishments, 
<A NAME="76"></A>and became generally neglected.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>It is stated in the invective which Antiphon wrote against Alcibiades, 
<A NAME="78"></A>that once, when he was a boy, he ran away to the house of Democrates, one 
<A NAME="79"></A>of those who made a favourite of him, and that Ariphon had determined to 
<A NAME="80"></A>cause proclamation to be made for him, had not Pericles diverted him from 
<A NAME="81"></A>it, by saying, that if he were dead, the proclaiming of him could only 
<A NAME="82"></A>cause it to be discovered one day sooner, and if he were safe, it would 
<A NAME="83"></A>be a reproach to him as long as he lived. Antiphon also says, that he killed 
<A NAME="84"></A>one of his own servants with the blow of a staff in Sibyrtius's wrestling 
<A NAME="85"></A>ground. But it is unreasonable to give credit to all that is objected by 
<A NAME="86"></A>an enemy, who makes open profession of his design to defame 
<A NAME="87"></A>him.
<A NAME="88"></A><BR><BR>It was manifest that the many well-born persons who were continually 
<A NAME="89"></A>seeking his company, and making their court to him, were attracted and 
<A NAME="90"></A>captivated by his brilliant and extraordinary beauty only. But the affection 
<A NAME="91"></A>which Socrates entertained for him is a great evidence of the natural noble 
<A NAME="92"></A>qualities and good disposition of the boy, which Socrates, indeed, detected 
<A NAME="93"></A>both in and under his personal beauty; and, hearing that his wealth and 
<A NAME="94"></A>station, and the great number both of strangers and Athenians who flattered 
<A NAME="95"></A>and caressed him, might at last corrupt him, resolved, if possible, to 
<A NAME="96"></A>interpose, and preserve hopeful a plant from perishing in the flower, before 
<A NAME="97"></A>its fruit came to perfection. For never did fortune surround and enclose 
<A NAME="98"></A>a man with so many of those things which we vulgarly call goods, or so 
<A NAME="99"></A>protect him from every weapon of philosophy, and fence him from every access 
<A NAME="100"></A>of free and searching words, as she did Alcibiades; who, from the beginning, 
<A NAME="101"></A>was exposed to the flatteries of those who sought merely his gratification, 
<A NAME="102"></A>such as might well unnerve him, and indispose him to listen to any real 
<A NAME="103"></A>adviser or instructor. Yet such was the happiness of his genius, that he 
<A NAME="104"></A>discerned Socrates from the rest, and admitted him, whilst he drove away 
<A NAME="105"></A>the wealthy and the noble who made court to him. And, in a little time, 
<A NAME="106"></A>they grew intimate, and Alcibiades, listening now to language entirely 
<A NAME="107"></A>free from every thought of unmanly fondness and silly displays of affection, 
<A NAME="108"></A>finding himself with one who sought to lay open to him the deficiencies 
<A NAME="109"></A>of his mind, and repress his vain and foolish arrogance-
<A NAME="110"></A><BR><BR>"Dropped like the craven cock his conquered 
<A NAME="111"></A>wing."
<A NAME="112"></A><BR><BR>He esteemed these endeavours of Socrates as most truly a means 
<A NAME="113"></A>which the gods made use of for the care and preservation of youth, and 
<A NAME="114"></A>began to think meanly of himself and to admire him; to be pleased with 
<A NAME="115"></A>his kindness, and to stand in awe of his virtue; and, unawares to himself, 
<A NAME="116"></A>there became formed in his mind that reflex image and reciprocation of 
<A NAME="117"></A>Love, or Anteros, that Plato talks of. It was a matter of general wonder, 
<A NAME="118"></A>when people saw him joining Socrates in his meals and his exercises, living 
<A NAME="119"></A>with him in the same tent, whilst he was reserved and rough to all others 
<A NAME="120"></A>who made their addresses to him, and acted, indeed, with great insolence 
<A NAME="121"></A>to some of them. As in particular to Anytus, the son of Anthemion, one 
<A NAME="122"></A>who was very fond of him, and invited him to an entertainment which he 
<A NAME="123"></A>had prepared for some strangers. Alcibiades refused the invitation; but, 
<A NAME="124"></A>having drunk to excess at his own house with some of his companions, went 
<A NAME="125"></A>thither with them to play some frolic; and, standing at the door of the 
<A NAME="126"></A>room where the guests were enjoying themselves, and seeing the tables covered 
<A NAME="127"></A>with gold and silver cups, he commanded his servants to take away the one-half 
<A NAME="128"></A>of them, and carry them to his own house; and then, disdaining so much 
<A NAME="129"></A>as to enter into the room himself, as soon as he had done this, went away. 
<A NAME="130"></A>The company was indignant, and exclaimed at his rude and insulting conduct; 
<A NAME="131"></A>Anytus, however, said, on the contrary, he had shown great consideration 
<A NAME="132"></A>and tenderness in taking only a part when he might have taken 
<A NAME="133"></A>all.
<A NAME="134"></A><BR><BR>He behaved in the same manner to all others who courted him except 
<A NAME="135"></A>only one stranger, who, as the story is told, having but a small estate, 
<A NAME="136"></A>sold it all for about a hundred staters, which he presented to Alcibiades, 
<A NAME="137"></A>and besought him to accept. Alcibiades, smiling and well pleased at the 
<A NAME="138"></A>thing, invited him to supper, and, after a very kind entertainment, gave 
<A NAME="139"></A>him his gold again, requiring him, moreover, not to fail to be present 
<A NAME="140"></A>the next day, when the public revenue was offered to farm, and to outbid 
<A NAME="141"></A>all others. The man would have excused himself, because the contract was 
<A NAME="142"></A>so large, and would cost many talents; but Alcibiades, who had at that 
<A NAME="143"></A>time a private pique against the existing farmers of the revenue, threatened 
<A NAME="144"></A>to have him beaten if he refused. The next morning, the stranger, coming 
<A NAME="145"></A>to the market-place, offered a talent more than the existing rate; upon 
<A NAME="146"></A>which the farmers, enraged and consulting together, called upon him to 
<A NAME="147"></A>name his sureties, concluding that he could find none. The poor man, being 
<A NAME="148"></A>startled at the proposal, began to retire; but Alcibiades, standing at 
<A NAME="149"></A>a distance, cried out to the magistrates, "Set my name down, he is a friend 
<A NAME="150"></A>of mine; I will be security for him." When the other bidders heard this, 
<A NAME="151"></A>they perceived that all their contrivance was defeated; for their way was, 
<A NAME="152"></A>with the profits of the second year to pay the rent for the year preceding; 
<A NAME="153"></A>so that, not seeing any other way to extricate themselves out of the difficulty, 
<A NAME="154"></A>they began to entreat the stranger, and offered him a sum of money. Alcibiades 
<A NAME="155"></A>would not suffer him to accept of less than a talent; but when that was 
<A NAME="156"></A>paid down, he commanded him to relinquish the bargain, having by this device 
<A NAME="157"></A>relieved his necessity.
<A NAME="158"></A><BR><BR>Though Socrates had many and powerful rivals, yet the natural good 
<A NAME="159"></A>qualities of Alcibiades gave his affection the mastery. His words overcame 
<A NAME="160"></A>him so much, as to draw tears from his eyes, and to disturb his very soul. 
<A NAME="161"></A>Yet sometimes he would abandon himself to flatterers, when they proposed 
<A NAME="162"></A>to him varieties of pleasure, and would desert Socrates; who, then, would 
<A NAME="163"></A>pursue him, as if he had been a fugitive slave. He despised every one else, 
<A NAME="164"></A>and had no reverence or awe for any one but him. Cleanthes the philosopher, 
<A NAME="165"></A>speaking of one to whom he was attached, says his only hold on him was 
<A NAME="166"></A>by his ears, while his rivals had all the others offered them; and there 
<A NAME="167"></A>is no question that Alcibiades was very easily caught by pleasure; and 
<A NAME="168"></A>the expression used by Thucydides about the excesses of his habitual course 
<A NAME="169"></A>of living gives occasion to believe so. But those who endeavoured to corrupt 
<A NAME="170"></A>Alcibiades took advantage chiefly of his vanity and ambition, and thrust 
<A NAME="171"></A>him on unseasonably to undertake great enterprises, persuading him, that 
<A NAME="172"></A>as soon as he began to concern himself in public affairs, he would not 
<A NAME="173"></A>only obscure the rest of the generals and statesmen, but outdo the authority 
<A NAME="174"></A>and the reputation which Pericles himself had gained in Greece. But in 
<A NAME="175"></A>the same manner as iron which is softened by the fire grows hard with the 
<A NAME="176"></A>cold and all its parts are closed again, so, as often as Socrates observed 
<A NAME="177"></A>Alcibiades to be misled by luxury or pride, he reduced and corrected him 
<A NAME="178"></A>by his addresses, and made him humble and modest, by showing him in how 
<A NAME="179"></A>many things he was deficient, and how very far from perfection in 
<A NAME="180"></A>virtue.
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR>When he was past his childhood, he went once to a grammar-school, 
<A NAME="182"></A>and asked the master for one of Homer's books; and he making answer that 
<A NAME="183"></A>he had nothing of Homer's, Alcibiades gave him a blow with his fist and 
<A NAME="184"></A>went away. Another schoolmaster telling him that he had Homer corrected 
<A NAME="185"></A>by himself; "How?" said Alcibiades, "and do you employ your time in teaching 
<A NAME="186"></A>children to read? You, who are able to amend Homer, may well undertake 
<A NAME="187"></A>to instruct men." Being once desirous to speak with Pericles, he went to 
<A NAME="188"></A>his house and was told there that he was not at leisure, but busied in 
<A NAME="189"></A>considering how to give up his accounts to the Athenians; Alcibiades, as 
<A NAME="190"></A>he went away, said, it "were better for him to consider how he might avoid 
<A NAME="191"></A>giving up his accounts at all."
<A NAME="192"></A><BR><BR>Whilst he was very young, he was a soldier in the expedition against 
<A NAME="193"></A>Potidaea, where Socrates lodged in the same tent with him, and stood next 
<A NAME="194"></A>to him in battle. Once there happened a sharp skirmish, in which they both 
<A NAME="195"></A>behaved with signal bravery; but Alcibiades receiving a wound, Socrates 
<A NAME="196"></A>threw himself before him to defend him, and beyond any question saved him 
<A NAME="197"></A>and his arms from the enemy, and so in all justice might have challenged 
<A NAME="198"></A>the prize of valour. But the generals appearing eager to adjudge the honour 
<A NAME="199"></A>to Alcibiades, because of his rank, Socrates, who desired to increase his 
<A NAME="200"></A>thirst after glory of a noble kind, was the first to give evidence for 
<A NAME="201"></A>him, and pressed them to crown him, and to decree to him the complete suit 
<A NAME="202"></A>of armour. Afterwards, in the battle of Delium, when the Athenians were 
<A NAME="203"></A>routed, and Socrates with a few others was retreating on foot, Alcibiades, 
<A NAME="204"></A>who was on horseback, observing it, would not pass on, but stayed to shelter 
<A NAME="205"></A>him from the danger, and brought him safe off, though the enemy pressed 
<A NAME="206"></A>hard upon them, and cut off many. But this happened some time 
<A NAME="207"></A>after.
<A NAME="208"></A><BR><BR>He gave a box on the ear to Hipponicus, the father of Callias, 
<A NAME="209"></A>whose birth and wealth made him a person of great influence and repute. 
<A NAME="210"></A>And this he did unprovoked by any passion or quarrel between them, but 
<A NAME="211"></A>only because, in a frolic, he had agreed with his companions to do it. 
<A NAME="212"></A>People were justly offended at this insolence when it became known through 
<A NAME="213"></A>the city; but early the next morning, Alcibiades went to his house and 
<A NAME="214"></A>knocked at the door and being admitted to him, took off his outer garment, 
<A NAME="215"></A>and presenting his naked body, desired him to scourge and chastise him 
<A NAME="216"></A>as he pleased. Upon this Hipponicus forgot all his resentment, and not 
<A NAME="217"></A>only pardoned him, but soon after gave him his daughter Hipparete in marriage. 
<A NAME="218"></A>Some say that it was not Hipponicus, but his son Callias, who gave Hipparete 
<A NAME="219"></A>to Alcibiades, together with a portion of ten talents, and that after, 
<A NAME="220"></A>when she had a child, Alcibiades forced him to give ten talents more, upon 
<A NAME="221"></A>pretence that such was the agreement if she brought him any children. Afterwards, 
<A NAME="222"></A>Callias, for fear of coming to his death by his means, declared, in a full 
<A NAME="223"></A>assembly of the people, that, if he should happen to die without children, 
<A NAME="224"></A>the state should inherit his house and all his goods. Hipparete was a virtuous 
<A NAME="225"></A>and dutiful wife, but, at last, growing impatient of the outrages done 
<A NAME="226"></A>to her by her husband's continual entertaining of courtesans, as well strangers 
<A NAME="227"></A>as Athenians, she departed from him and retired to her brother's house. 
<A NAME="228"></A>Alcibiades seemed not at all concerned at this, and lived on still in the 
<A NAME="229"></A>same luxury; but the law requiring that she should deliver to the archon 
<A NAME="230"></A>in person, and not by proxy, the instrument by which she claimed a divorce, 
<A NAME="231"></A>when, in obedience to the law, she presented herself before him to perform 
<A NAME="232"></A>this, Alcibiades came in, caught her up, and carried her home through the 
<A NAME="233"></A>market-place, no one daring to oppose him nor to take her from him. She 
<A NAME="234"></A>continued with him till her death, which happened not long after, when 
<A NAME="235"></A>Alcibiades had gone to Ephesus. Nor is this violence to be thought so very 
<A NAME="236"></A>enormous or unmanly. For the law, in making her who desires to be divorced 
<A NAME="237"></A>appear in public, seems to design to give her husband an opportunity of 
<A NAME="238"></A>treating with her, and endeavouring to retain her.
<A NAME="239"></A><BR><BR>Alcibiades had a dog which cost him seventy minas, and was a very 
<A NAME="240"></A>large one, and very handsome. His tail, which was his principal ornament, 
<A NAME="241"></A>he caused to be cut off, and his acquaintances exclaiming at him for it, 
<A NAME="242"></A>and telling him that all Athens was sorry for the dog, and cried out upon 
<A NAME="243"></A>him for this action, he laughed, and said, "Just what I wanted has happened 
<A NAME="244"></A>then. I wished the Athenians to talk about this, that they might not say 
<A NAME="245"></A>something worse of me."
<A NAME="246"></A><BR><BR>It is said that the first time he came into the assembly was upon 
<A NAME="247"></A>occasion of a largess of money which he made to the people. This was not 
<A NAME="248"></A>done by design, but as he passed along he heard a shout, and inquiring 
<A NAME="249"></A>the cause, and having learned that there was a donative making to the people, 
<A NAME="250"></A>he went in amongst them and gave money also. The multitude thereupon applauding 
<A NAME="251"></A>him, and shouting, he was so transported at it, that he forgot a quail 
<A NAME="252"></A>which he had under his robe, and the bird, being frightened with the noise, 
<A NAME="253"></A>flew off; upon which the people made louder acclamations than before, and 
<A NAME="254"></A>many of them started up to pursue the bird; and one Antiochus, a pilot, 
<A NAME="255"></A>caught it and restored it to him, for which he was ever after a favourite 
<A NAME="256"></A>with Alcibiades.
<A NAME="257"></A><BR><BR>He had great advantages for entering public life; his noble birth, 
<A NAME="258"></A>his riches, the personal courage he had shown in divers battles, and the 
<A NAME="259"></A>multitude of his friends and dependents, threw open, so to say, folding-doors 
<A NAME="260"></A>for his admittance. But he did not consent to let his power with the people 
<A NAME="261"></A>rest on anything, rather than on his own gift of eloquence. That he was 
<A NAME="262"></A>a master in the art of speaking, the comic poets bear him witness; and 
<A NAME="263"></A>the most eloquent of public speakers, in his oration against Midias, allows 
<A NAME="264"></A>that Alcibiades, among other perfections, was a most accomplished orator. 
<A NAME="265"></A>If, however, we give credit to Theophrastus, who of all philosophers was 
<A NAME="266"></A>the most curious inquirer, and the greatest lover of history, we are to 
<A NAME="267"></A>understand that Alcibiades had the highest capacity for inventing, for 
<A NAME="268"></A>discerning what was the right thing to be said for any purpose, and on 
<A NAME="269"></A>any occasion; but aiming not only at saying what was required, but also 
<A NAME="270"></A>at saying it well, in respect, that is, of words and phrases, when these 
<A NAME="271"></A>did not readily occur, he would often pause in the middle of his discourse 
<A NAME="272"></A>for want of the apt word, and would be silent and stop till he could recollect 
<A NAME="273"></A>himself, and had considered what to say.
<A NAME="274"></A><BR><BR>His expenses in horses kept for the public games, and in the number 
<A NAME="275"></A>of his chariots, were matter of great observation; never did any one but 
<A NAME="276"></A>he, either private person or king, send seven chariots to the Olympic games. 
<A NAME="277"></A>And to have carried away at once the first, the second, and the fourth 
<A NAME="278"></A>prize, as Thucydides says, or the third, as Euripides relates it, outdoes 
<A NAME="279"></A>far away every distinction that ever was known or thought of in that kind. 
<A NAME="280"></A>Euripides celebrates his success in this manner:-
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR>"-But my song to you,
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>Son of Clinias, is due.
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>Victory is noble; how much more
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>To do as never Greek before;
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>To obtain in the great chariot race
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>The first, the second, and third place;
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>With easy step advanced to fame
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>To bid the herald three times claim
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>The olive for one victor's name." The emulation displayed by the deputations 
<A NAME="290"></A>of various states in the presents which they made to him, rendered this 
<A NAME="291"></A>success yet more illustrious. The Ephesians erected a tent for him, adorned 
<A NAME="292"></A>magnificently; the city of Chios furnished him with provender for his horses 
<A NAME="293"></A>and with great numbers of beasts for sacrifice; and the Lesbians sent him 
<A NAME="294"></A>wine and other provisions for the many great entertainments which he made. 
<A NAME="295"></A>Yet in the midst of all this he escaped not without censure, occasioned 
<A NAME="296"></A>either by the ill-nature of his enemies or by his own misconduct. For it 
<A NAME="297"></A>is said, that one Diomedes, an Athenian, a worthy man and a friend to Alcibiades, 
<A NAME="298"></A>passionately desiring to obtain the victory at the Olympic games, and having 
<A NAME="299"></A>heard much of a chariot which belonged to the state at Argos, where he 
<A NAME="300"></A>knew that Alcibiades had great power and many friends, prevailed with him 
<A NAME="301"></A>to undertake to buy the chariot. Alcibiades did indeed buy it, but then 
<A NAME="302"></A>claimed it for his own, leaving Diomedes to rage at him, and to call upon 
<A NAME="303"></A>the gods and men to bear witness to the injustice. It would seem there 
<A NAME="304"></A>was a suit at law commenced upon this occasion, and there is yet extant 
<A NAME="305"></A>an oration concerning the chariot, written by Isocrates in defence of the 
<A NAME="306"></A>son of Alcibiades. But the plaintiff in this action is named Tisias, and 
<A NAME="307"></A>not Diomedes.
<A NAME="308"></A><BR><BR>As soon as he began to intermeddle in the government, which was 
<A NAME="309"></A>when he was very young, he quickly lessened the credit of all who aspired 
<A NAME="310"></A>to the confidence of the people except Phaeax, the son of Erasistratus, 
<A NAME="311"></A>and Nicias the son of Niceratus, who alone could contest it with him. Nicias 
<A NAME="312"></A>was arrived at a mature age, and was esteemed their first general. Phaeax 
<A NAME="313"></A>was but a rising statesman like Alcibiades; he was descended from noble 
<A NAME="314"></A>ancestors, but was his inferior, as in many other things, so, principally, 
<A NAME="315"></A>in eloquence. He possessed rather the art of persuading in private conversation 
<A NAME="316"></A>than of debate before the people, and was, as Eupolis said of 
<A NAME="317"></A>him-
<A NAME="318"></A><BR><BR>"The best of talkers, and of speakers worst." There is extant an 
<A NAME="319"></A>oration written by Phaeax against Alcibiades, in which, amongst other things, 
<A NAME="320"></A>it is said, that Alcibiades made daily use at his table of many gold and 
<A NAME="321"></A>silver vessels, which belonged to the commonwealth, as if they had been 
<A NAME="322"></A>his own.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR><BR>There was a certain Hyperbolus, of the township of Perithoedae, 
<A NAME="324"></A>whom Thucydides also speaks of as a man of bad character, a general butt 
<A NAME="325"></A>for the mockery of all the comic writers of the time, but quite unconcerned 
<A NAME="326"></A>at the worst things they could say, and, being careless of glory, also 
<A NAME="327"></A>insensible of shame; a temper which some people call boldness and courage, 
<A NAME="328"></A>whereas it is indeed impudence and recklessness. He was liked by nobody, 
<A NAME="329"></A>yet the people made frequent use of him, when they had a mind to disgrace 
<A NAME="330"></A>or calumniate any persons in authority. At this time, the people, by his 
<A NAME="331"></A>persuasions, were ready to proceed to pronounce the sentence of ten years' 
<A NAME="332"></A>banishment, called ostracism. This they made use of to humiliate and drive 
<A NAME="333"></A>out of the city such citizens as outdid the rest in credit and power, indulging 
<A NAME="334"></A>not so much perhaps their apprehensions as their jealousies in this way. 
<A NAME="335"></A>And when, at this time, there was no doubt but that the ostracism would 
<A NAME="336"></A>fall upon one of those three, Alcibiades contrived to form a coalition 
<A NAME="337"></A>of parties, and, communicating his project to Nicias, turned the sentence 
<A NAME="338"></A>upon Hyperbolus himself. Others say, that it was not with Nicias, but Phaeax, 
<A NAME="339"></A>that he consulted, and by help of his party procured the banishment of 
<A NAME="340"></A>Hyperbolus, when he suspected nothing less. For, before that time, no mean 
<A NAME="341"></A>or obscure person had ever fallen under the punishment, so that Plato, 
<A NAME="342"></A>the comic poet, speaking of Hyperbolus, might well say-
<A NAME="343"></A><BR><BR>"The man deserved the fate; deny't who can?
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>Yes, but the fate did not deserve the man;
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>Not for the like of him and his slave-brands
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>Did Athens put the sherd into our hands." But we have given elsewhere 
<A NAME="347"></A>a fuller statement of what is known to us of the matter.
<A NAME="348"></A><BR><BR>Alcibiades was not less disturbed at the distinctions which Nicias 
<A NAME="349"></A>gained amongst the enemies of Athens than at the honours which the Athenians 
<A NAME="350"></A>themselves paid to him. For though Alcibiades was the proper appointed 
<A NAME="351"></A>person to receive all Lacedaemonians when they came to Athens, and had 
<A NAME="352"></A>taken particular care of those that were made prisoners at Pylos, yet, 
<A NAME="353"></A>after they had obtained the peace and restitution of the captives, by the 
<A NAME="354"></A>procurement chiefly of Nicias, they paid him very special attentions. And 
<A NAME="355"></A>it was commonly said in Greece, that the war was begun by Pericles, and 
<A NAME="356"></A>that Nicias made an end of it, and the peace was generally called the peace 
<A NAME="357"></A>of Nicias. Alcibiades was extremely annoyed at this, and being full of 
<A NAME="358"></A>envy, set himself to break the league. First, therefore, observing that 
<A NAME="359"></A>the Argives, as well out of fear as hatred to the Lacedaemonians, sought 
<A NAME="360"></A>for protection against them, he gave them a secret assurance of alliance 
<A NAME="361"></A>with Athens. And communicating, as well in person as by letters, with the 
<A NAME="362"></A>chief advisers of the people there, he encouraged them not to fear the 
<A NAME="363"></A>Lacedaemonians, nor make concessions to them, but to wait a little, and 
<A NAME="364"></A>keep their eyes on the Athenians, who, already, were all but sorry they 
<A NAME="365"></A>had made peace, and would soon give it up. And afterwards, when the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="366"></A>had made a league with the Boeotians, and had not delivered up Panactum 
<A NAME="367"></A>entire, as they ought to have done by the treaty, but only after first 
<A NAME="368"></A>destroying it, which gave great offence to the people of Athens, Alcibiades 
<A NAME="369"></A>laid hold of that opportunity to exasperate them more highly. He exclaimed 
<A NAME="370"></A>fiercely against Nicias, and accused him of many things, which seemed probable 
<A NAME="371"></A>enough: as that, when he was general, he made no attempt himself to capture 
<A NAME="372"></A>their enemies that were shut up in the isle of Sphacteria, but, when they 
<A NAME="373"></A>were afterwards made prisoners by others, he procured their release and 
<A NAME="374"></A>sent them back to the Lacedaemonians, only to get favour with them; that 
<A NAME="375"></A>he would not make use of his credit with them to prevent their entering 
<A NAME="376"></A>into this confederacy with the Boeotians and Corinthians, and yet, on the 
<A NAME="377"></A>other side, that he sought to stand in the way of those Greeks who were 
<A NAME="378"></A>inclined to make an alliance and friendship with Athens, if the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="379"></A>did not like it.
<A NAME="380"></A><BR><BR>It happened, at the very time when Nicias was by these arts brought 
<A NAME="381"></A>into disgrace with the people, that ambassadors arrived from Lacedaemon, 
<A NAME="382"></A>who, at their first coming, said what seemed very satisfactory, declaring 
<A NAME="383"></A>that they had full powers to arrange all matters in dispute upon fair and 
<A NAME="384"></A>equal terms. The council received their propositions, and the people were 
<A NAME="385"></A>to assemble on the morrow to give them audience. Alcibiades grew very apprehensive 
<A NAME="386"></A>of this, and contrived to gain a secret conference with the ambassadors. 
<A NAME="387"></A>When they were met, he said: "What is it you intend, you men of Sparta? 
<A NAME="388"></A>Can you be ignorant that the council always act with moderation and respect 
<A NAME="389"></A>towards ambassadors, but that the people are full of ambition and great 
<A NAME="390"></A>designs? So that, if you let them know what full powers your commission 
<A NAME="391"></A>gives you, they will urge and press you to unreasonable conditions. Quit, 
<A NAME="392"></A>therefore, this indiscreet simplicity, if you expect to obtain equal terms 
<A NAME="393"></A>from the Athenians, and would not have things extorted from you contrary 
<A NAME="394"></A>to your inclinations, and begin to treat with the people upon some reasonable 
<A NAME="395"></A>articles, not avowing yourselves plenipotentiaries; and I will be ready 
<A NAME="396"></A>to assist you, out of good-will to the Lacedaemonians." When he had said 
<A NAME="397"></A>thus, he gave them his oath for the performance of what he promised, and 
<A NAME="398"></A>by this way drew them from Nicias to rely entirely upon himself, and left 
<A NAME="399"></A>them full of admiration of the discernment and sagacity they had seen in 
<A NAME="400"></A>him. The next day, when the people were assembled and the ambassadors introduced, 
<A NAME="401"></A>Alcibiades, with great apparent courtesy, demanded of them, With what powers 
<A NAME="402"></A>they were come? They made answer that they were not come as 
<A NAME="403"></A>plenipotentiaries.
<A NAME="404"></A><BR><BR>Instantly upon that, Alcibiades, with a loud voice, as though he 
<A NAME="405"></A>had received and not done the wrong, began to call them dishonest prevaricators, 
<A NAME="406"></A>and to urge that such men could not possibly come with a purpose to say 
<A NAME="407"></A>or do anything that was sincere. The council was incensed, the people were 
<A NAME="408"></A>in a rage, and Nicias, who knew nothing of the deceit and the imposture, 
<A NAME="409"></A>was in the greatest confusion, equally surprised and ashamed at such a 
<A NAME="410"></A>change in the men. So thus the Lacedaemonian ambassadors were utterly rejected, 
<A NAME="411"></A>and Alcibiades was declared general, who presently united the Argives, 
<A NAME="412"></A>the Eleans, and the people of Mantinea, into a confederacy with the 
<A NAME="413"></A>Athenians.
<A NAME="414"></A><BR><BR>No man commended the method by which Alcibiades effected all this, 
<A NAME="415"></A>yet it was a great political feat thus to divide and shake almost all Peloponnesus, 
<A NAME="416"></A>and to combine so many men in arms against the Lacedaemonians in one day 
<A NAME="417"></A>before Mantinea; and, moreover, to remove the war and the danger so far 
<A NAME="418"></A>from the frontier of the Athenians, that even success would profit the 
<A NAME="419"></A>enemy but little, should they be conquerors, whereas, if they were defeated, 
<A NAME="420"></A>Sparta itself was hardly safe.
<A NAME="421"></A><BR><BR>After this battle at Mantinea, the select thousand of the army 
<A NAME="422"></A>of the Argives attempted to overthrow the government of the people in Argos, 
<A NAME="423"></A>and make themselves masters of the city; and the Lacedaemonians came to 
<A NAME="424"></A>their aid and abolished the democracy. But the people took arms again, 
<A NAME="425"></A>and gained the advantage, and Alcibiades came in to their aid and completed 
<A NAME="426"></A>the victory, and persuaded them to build long walls, and by that means 
<A NAME="427"></A>to join their city to the sea, and so to bring it wholly within reach of 
<A NAME="428"></A>the Athenian power. To this purpose he procured them builders and masons 
<A NAME="429"></A>from Athens, and displayed the greatest zeal for their service, and gained 
<A NAME="430"></A>no less honour and power to himself than to the commonwealth of Athens. 
<A NAME="431"></A>He also persuaded the people of Patrae to join their city to the sea, by 
<A NAME="432"></A>building long walls; and when some one told them, by way of warning, that 
<A NAME="433"></A>the Athenians would swallow them up at last, Alcibiades made answer, "Possibly 
<A NAME="434"></A>it may be so, but it will be by little and little, and beginning at the 
<A NAME="435"></A>feet, whereas the Lacedaemonians will begin at the head and devour you 
<A NAME="436"></A>all at once." Nor did he neglect either to advise the Athenians to look 
<A NAME="437"></A>to their interests by land, and often put the young men in mind of the 
<A NAME="438"></A>oath which they had made at Agraulos, to the effect that they would account 
<A NAME="439"></A>wheat and barley, and vines and olives, to be the limits of Attica; by 
<A NAME="440"></A>which they were taught to claim a title to all land that was cultivated 
<A NAME="441"></A>and productive.
<A NAME="442"></A><BR><BR>But with all these words and deeds, and with all this sagacity 
<A NAME="443"></A>and eloquence, he intermingled exorbitant luxury and wantonness, in his 
<A NAME="444"></A>eating and drinking and dissolute living; wore long purple robes like a 
<A NAME="445"></A>woman, which dragged after him as he went through the market-place; caused 
<A NAME="446"></A>the planks of his galley to be cut away, that so he might lie the softer, 
<A NAME="447"></A>his bed not being placed on the boards, but hanging upon girths. His shield, 
<A NAME="448"></A>again, which was richly gilded, had not the usual ensigns of the Athenians, 
<A NAME="449"></A>but a Cupid, holding a thunderbolt in his hand, was painted upon it. The 
<A NAME="450"></A>sight of all this made the people of good repute in the city feel disgust 
<A NAME="451"></A>and abhorrence, and apprehension also, at his free living, and his contempt 
<A NAME="452"></A>of law, as things monstrous in themselves, and indicating designs of usurpation. 
<A NAME="453"></A>Aristophanes has well expressed the people's feelings toward 
<A NAME="454"></A>him-
<A NAME="455"></A><BR><BR>"They love, and hate, and cannot do without him." And still more 
<A NAME="456"></A>strongly, under a figurative expression,-
<A NAME="457"></A><BR><BR>"Best rear no lion in your state, 'tis true;
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>But treat him like a lion if you do."
<A NAME="459"></A><BR><BR>The truth is, his liberalities, his public shows, and other munificence 
<A NAME="460"></A>to the people, which were such as nothing could exceed, the glory of his 
<A NAME="461"></A>ancestors, the force of his eloquence, the grace of his person, his strength 
<A NAME="462"></A>of body, joined with his great courage and knowledge in military affairs, 
<A NAME="463"></A>prevailed upon the Athenians to endure patiently his excesses, to indulge 
<A NAME="464"></A>many things to him, and, according to their habit, to give the softest 
<A NAME="465"></A>names to his faults, attributing them to youth and good nature. As, for 
<A NAME="466"></A>example, he kept Agatharcus, the painter, a prisoner till he had painted 
<A NAME="467"></A>his whole house, but then dismissed him with a reward. He publicly struck 
<A NAME="468"></A>Taureas, who exhibited certain shows in opposition to him and contended 
<A NAME="469"></A>with him for the prize. He selected for himself one of the captive Melian 
<A NAME="470"></A>women, and had a son by her, whom he took care to educate. This the Athenians 
<A NAME="471"></A>styled great humanity, and yet he was the principal cause of the slaughter 
<A NAME="472"></A>of all the inhabitants of the isle of Melos who were of age to bear arms, 
<A NAME="473"></A>having spoken in favour of that decree. When Aristophon, the painter, had 
<A NAME="474"></A>drawn Nemea sitting and holding Alcibiades in her arms, the multitudes 
<A NAME="475"></A>seemed pleased with the piece, and thronged to see it, but older people 
<A NAME="476"></A>disliked and disrelished it, and looked on these things as enormities, 
<A NAME="477"></A>and movements towards tyranny. So that it was not said amiss by Archestratus, 
<A NAME="478"></A>that Greece could not support a second Alcibiades. Once, when Alcibiades 
<A NAME="479"></A>succeeded well in an oration which he made, and the whole assembly attended 
<A NAME="480"></A>upon him to do him honour, Timon the misanthrope did not pass slightly 
<A NAME="481"></A>by him, nor avoid him, as did others, but purposely met him, and taking 
<A NAME="482"></A>him by the hand, said, "Go on boldly, my son, and increase in credit with 
<A NAME="483"></A>the people, for thou wilt one day bring them calamities enough." Some that 
<A NAME="484"></A>were present laughed at the saying, and some reviled Timon; but there were 
<A NAME="485"></A>others upon whom it made a deep impression; so various was the judgment 
<A NAME="486"></A>which was made of him, and so irregular his own character.
<A NAME="487"></A><BR><BR>The Athenians, even in the lifetime of Pericles, had already cast 
<A NAME="488"></A>a longing eye upon Sicily; but did not attempt anything till after his 
<A NAME="489"></A>death. Then, under pretence of aiding their confederates, they sent succours 
<A NAME="490"></A>upon all occasions to those who were oppressed by the Syracusans, preparing 
<A NAME="491"></A>the way for sending over a greater force. But Alcibiades was the person 
<A NAME="492"></A>who inflamed this desire of theirs to the height, and prevailed with them 
<A NAME="493"></A>no longer to proceed secretly, and by little and little, in their design, 
<A NAME="494"></A>but to sail out with a great fleet, and undertake at once to make themselves 
<A NAME="495"></A>masters of the island. He possessed the people with great hopes, and he 
<A NAME="496"></A>himself entertained yet greater; and the conquest of Sicily, which was 
<A NAME="497"></A>the utmost bound of their ambition, was but the mere outset of his expectation. 
<A NAME="498"></A>Nicias endeavoured to divert the people from the expedition, by representing 
<A NAME="499"></A>to them that the taking of Syracuse would be a work of great difficulty; 
<A NAME="500"></A>but Alcibiades dreamed of nothing less than the conquest of Carthage and 
<A NAME="501"></A>Libya, and by the accession of these conceiving himself at once made master 
<A NAME="502"></A>of Italy and Peloponnesus, seemed to look upon Sicily as little more than 
<A NAME="503"></A>a magazine for the war. The young men were soon elevated with these hopes 
<A NAME="504"></A>and listened gladly to those of riper years, who talked wonders of the 
<A NAME="505"></A>countries they were going to; so that you might see great numbers sitting 
<A NAME="506"></A>in the wrestling grounds and public places, drawing on the ground the figure 
<A NAME="507"></A>of the island and the situation of Libya and Carthage. Socrates the philosopher 
<A NAME="508"></A>and Meton the astrologer are said, however, never to have hoped for any 
<A NAME="509"></A>good to the commonwealth from this war; the one, it is to be supposed, 
<A NAME="510"></A>presaging what would ensue, by the intervention of his attendant Genius; 
<A NAME="511"></A>and the other, either upon rational consideration of the project or by 
<A NAME="512"></A>use of the art of divination, conceived fears for its issue, and, feigning 
<A NAME="513"></A>madness, caught up a burning torch, and seemed as if he would have set 
<A NAME="514"></A>his own house on fire. Others report, that he did not take upon him to 
<A NAME="515"></A>act the madman, but secretly in the night set his house on fire, and the 
<A NAME="516"></A>next morning besought the people, that for his comfort, after such a calamity, 
<A NAME="517"></A>they would spare his son from the expedition. By which artifice he deceived 
<A NAME="518"></A>his fellow citizens, and obtained of them what he desired.
<A NAME="519"></A><BR><BR>Together with Alcibiades, Nicias, much against his will, was appointed 
<A NAME="520"></A>general; and he endeavoured to avoid the command, not the less on account 
<A NAME="521"></A>of his colleague. But the Athenians thought the war would proceed more 
<A NAME="522"></A>prosperously, if they did not send Alcibiades free from all restraint, 
<A NAME="523"></A>but tempered his heat with the caution of Nicias. This they chose the rather 
<A NAME="524"></A>to do, because Lamachus, the third general, though he was of mature years, 
<A NAME="525"></A>yet in several battles had appeared no less hot and rash than Alcibiades 
<A NAME="526"></A>himself. When they began to deliberate of the number of forces, and of 
<A NAME="527"></A>the manner of making the necessary provisions, Nicias made another attempt 
<A NAME="528"></A>to oppose the design, and to prevent the war; but Alcibiades contradicted 
<A NAME="529"></A>him, and carried his point with the people. And one Demostratus, an orator, 
<A NAME="530"></A>proposing to give the generals absolute power over the preparations and 
<A NAME="531"></A>the whole management of the war, it was presently decreed so. When all 
<A NAME="532"></A>things were fitted for the voyage, many unlucky omens appeared. At that 
<A NAME="533"></A>very time the feast of Adonis happened in which the women were used to 
<A NAME="534"></A>expose, in all parts of the city, images resembling dead men carried out 
<A NAME="535"></A>to their burial, and to represent funeral solemnities by lamentations and 
<A NAME="536"></A>mournful songs. The mutilation, however, of the images of Mercury, most 
<A NAME="537"></A>of which, in one night, had their faces all disfigured, terrified many 
<A NAME="538"></A>persons who were wont to despise most things of that nature. It was given 
<A NAME="539"></A>out that it was done by the Corinthians, for the sake of the Syracusans, 
<A NAME="540"></A>who were their colony, in hopes that the Athenians, by such prodigies, 
<A NAME="541"></A>might be induced to delay or abandon the war. But the report gained no 
<A NAME="542"></A>credit with the people, nor yet the opinion of those who would not believe 
<A NAME="543"></A>that there was anything ominous in the matter, but that it was only an 
<A NAME="544"></A>extravagant action, committed, in that sort of sport which runs into licence, 
<A NAME="545"></A>by wild young men coming from a debauch. Alike enraged and terrified at 
<A NAME="546"></A>the thing, looking upon it to proceed from a conspiracy of persons who 
<A NAME="547"></A>designed some commotions in the state, the council, as well as the assembly 
<A NAME="548"></A>of the people, which were held frequently in a few days' space, examined 
<A NAME="549"></A>diligently everything that might administer ground for suspicion. During 
<A NAME="550"></A>this examination, Androcles, one of the demagogues, produced certain slaves 
<A NAME="551"></A>and strangers before them, who accused Alcibiades and some of his friends 
<A NAME="552"></A>of defacing other images in the same manner, and of having profanely acted 
<A NAME="553"></A>the sacred mysteries at a drunken meeting, where one Theodorus represented 
<A NAME="554"></A>the herald, Polytion the torch-bearer, and Alcibiades the chief priest, 
<A NAME="555"></A>while the rest of the party appeared as candidates for initiation, and 
<A NAME="556"></A>received the title of Initiates. These were the matters contained in the 
<A NAME="557"></A>articles of information which Thessalus, the son of Cimon, exhibited against 
<A NAME="558"></A>Alcibiades, for his impious mockery of the goddesses Ceres and Proserpine. 
<A NAME="559"></A>The people were highly exasperated and incensed against Alcibiades upon 
<A NAME="560"></A>this accusation, which being aggravated by Androcles, the most malicious 
<A NAME="561"></A>of all his enemies, at first disturbed his friends exceedingly. But when 
<A NAME="562"></A>they perceived that all the seamen designed for Sicily were for him, and 
<A NAME="563"></A>the soldiers also, and when the Argive and Mantinean auxiliaries, a thousand 
<A NAME="564"></A>men at arms, openly declared that they had undertaken this distant maritime 
<A NAME="565"></A>expedition for the sake of Alcibiades, and that, if he was ill-used, they 
<A NAME="566"></A>would all go home, they recovered their courage, and became eager to make 
<A NAME="567"></A>use of the present opportunity for justifying him. At this his enemies 
<A NAME="568"></A>were again discouraged, fearing lest the people should be more gentle to 
<A NAME="569"></A>him in their sentence, because of the occasion they had for his service. 
<A NAME="570"></A>Therefore, to obviate this, they contrived that some other orators, who 
<A NAME="571"></A>did not appear to be enemies to Alcibiades, but really hated him no less 
<A NAME="572"></A>than those who avowed it, should stand up in the assembly and say that 
<A NAME="573"></A>it was a very absurd thing that one who was created general of such an 
<A NAME="574"></A>army with absolute power, after his troops were assembled, and the confederates 
<A NAME="575"></A>were come, should lose the opportunity, whilst the people were choosing 
<A NAME="576"></A>his judges by lot, and appointing times for the hearing of the cause. And, 
<A NAME="577"></A>therefore, let him set sail at once, good fortune attend him; and when 
<A NAME="578"></A>the war should be at an end, he might then in person make his defence according 
<A NAME="579"></A>to the laws.
<A NAME="580"></A><BR><BR>Alcibiades perceived the malice of this postponement, and, appearing 
<A NAME="581"></A>in the assembly, represented that it was monstrous for him to be sent with 
<A NAME="582"></A>the command of so large an army, when he lay under such accusations and 
<A NAME="583"></A>calumnies; that he deserved to die, if he could not clear himself of the 
<A NAME="584"></A>crimes objected to him; but when he had so done, and had proved his innocence, 
<A NAME="585"></A>he should then cheerfully apply himself to the war, as standing no longer 
<A NAME="586"></A>in fear of false accusers. But he could not prevail with the people, who 
<A NAME="587"></A>commanded him to sail immediately. So he departed, together with the other 
<A NAME="588"></A>generals, having with them near 140 galleys, 5,100 men at arms, and about 
<A NAME="589"></A>1,300 archers, slingers, and light-armed men, and all the other provisions 
<A NAME="590"></A>corresponding.
<A NAME="591"></A><BR><BR>Arriving on the coast of Italy, he landed at Rhegium, and there 
<A NAME="592"></A>stated his views of the manner in which they ought to conduct the war. 
<A NAME="593"></A>He was opposed by Nicias; but Lamachus being of his opinion, they sailed 
<A NAME="594"></A>for Sicily forthwith, and took Catana. This was all that was done while 
<A NAME="595"></A>he was there, for he was soon after recalled by the Athenians to abide 
<A NAME="596"></A>his trial. At first, as we before said, there were only some slight suspicions 
<A NAME="597"></A>advanced against Alcibiades, and accusations by certain slaves and strangers. 
<A NAME="598"></A>But afterwards, in his absence, his enemies attacked him more violently, 
<A NAME="599"></A>and confounded together the breaking the images with the profanation of 
<A NAME="600"></A>the mysteries, as though both had been committed in pursuance of the same 
<A NAME="601"></A>conspiracy for changing the government. The people proceeded to imprison 
<A NAME="602"></A>all that were accused, without distinction, and without hearing them, and 
<A NAME="603"></A>repented now, considering the importance of the charge, that they had not 
<A NAME="604"></A>immediately brought Alcibiades to his trial, and given judgment against 
<A NAME="605"></A>him. Any of his friends or acquaintance who fell into the people's hands, 
<A NAME="606"></A>whilst they were in this fury, did not fail to meet with very severe usage. 
<A NAME="607"></A>Thucydides has omitted to name the informers, but others mention Dioclides 
<A NAME="608"></A>and Teucer. Amongst whom is Phrynichus, the comic poet, in whom we find 
<A NAME="609"></A>the following:-
<A NAME="610"></A><BR><BR>"O dearest Hermes! only do take care,
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>And mind you do not miss your footing there;
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>Should you get hurt, occasion may arise
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>For a new Dioclides to tell lies." To which he makes Mercury return 
<A NAME="614"></A>this answer:-
<A NAME="615"></A><BR><BR>"will so, for I feel no inclination
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>To reward Teucer for more information." The truth is, his accusers 
<A NAME="617"></A>alleged nothing that was certain or solid against him. One of them, being 
<A NAME="618"></A>asked how he knew the men who defaced the images, replying, that he saw 
<A NAME="619"></A>them by the light of the moon, made a palpable misstatement, for it was 
<A NAME="620"></A>just new moon when the fact was committed. This made all men of understanding 
<A NAME="621"></A>cry out upon the thing; but the people were as eager as ever to receive 
<A NAME="622"></A>further accusations, nor was their first heat at all abated, but they instantly 
<A NAME="623"></A>seized and imprisoned every one that was accused. Amongst those who were 
<A NAME="624"></A>detained in prison for their trials was Andocides the orator, whose descent 
<A NAME="625"></A>the historian Hellanicus deduces from Ulysses. He was always supposed to 
<A NAME="626"></A>hate popular government, and to support oligarchy. The chief ground of 
<A NAME="627"></A>his being suspected of defacing the images was because the great Mercury, 
<A NAME="628"></A>which stood near his house, and was an ancient monument of the tribe Aegeis, 
<A NAME="629"></A>was almost the only statute of all the remarkable ones which remained entire. 
<A NAME="630"></A>For this cause, it is now called the Mercury of Andocides, all men giving 
<A NAME="631"></A>it that name, though the inscription is evidence to the contrary. It happened 
<A NAME="632"></A>that Andocides, amongst the rest who were prisoners upon the same account, 
<A NAME="633"></A>contracted particular acquaintance and intimacy with one Timaeus, a person 
<A NAME="634"></A>inferior to him in repute, but of remarkable dexterity and boldness. He 
<A NAME="635"></A>persuaded Andocides to accuse him and some few others of this crime, urging 
<A NAME="636"></A>to him that, upon his confession, he would be, by the decree of the people, 
<A NAME="637"></A>secure of his pardon, whereas the event of judgment is uncertain to all 
<A NAME="638"></A>men, but to great persons, such as he was, most formidable. So that it 
<A NAME="639"></A>was better for him, if he regarded himself, to save his life by falsity, 
<A NAME="640"></A>than to suffer an infamous death, as really guilty of the crime. And if 
<A NAME="641"></A>he had regard to the public good, it was commendable to sacrifice a few 
<A NAME="642"></A>suspected men, by that means to rescue many excellent persons from the 
<A NAME="643"></A>fury of the people. Andocides was prevailed upon, and accused himself and 
<A NAME="644"></A>some others, and, by the terms of the decree, obtained his pardon, while 
<A NAME="645"></A>all the persons named by him, except some few who had saved themselves 
<A NAME="646"></A>by flight, suffered death. To gain the greater credit to his information, 
<A NAME="647"></A>he accused his own servants amongst others. But notwithstanding this, the 
<A NAME="648"></A>people's anger was not wholly appeased; and being now no longer diverted 
<A NAME="649"></A>by the mutilators, they were at leisure to pour out their whole rage upon 
<A NAME="650"></A>Alcibiades. And, in conclusion, they sent the galley named Salaminian to 
<A NAME="651"></A>recall him. But they expressly commanded those that were sent to use no 
<A NAME="652"></A>violence, nor seize upon his person, but address themselves to him in the 
<A NAME="653"></A>mildest terms, requiring him to follow them to Athens in order to abide 
<A NAME="654"></A>his trial, and clear himself before the people. For they feared mutiny 
<A NAME="655"></A>and sedition in the army in an enemy's country, which indeed it would have 
<A NAME="656"></A>been easy for Alcibiades to effect, if he had wished it. For the soldiers 
<A NAME="657"></A>were dispirited upon his departure, expecting for the future tedious delays, 
<A NAME="658"></A>and that the war would be drawn out into a lazy length by Nicias, when 
<A NAME="659"></A>Alcibiades, who was the spur to action, was taken away. For though Lamachus 
<A NAME="660"></A>was a soldier, and a man of courage, poverty deprived him of authority 
<A NAME="661"></A>and respect in the army. Alcibiades, just upon his departure, prevented 
<A NAME="662"></A>Messena from falling into the hands of the Athenians. There were some in 
<A NAME="663"></A>that city who were upon the point of delivering it up, but he, knowing 
<A NAME="664"></A>the persons, gave information to some friends of the Syracusans, and so 
<A NAME="665"></A>defeated the whole contrivance. When he arrived at Thurii, he went on shore, 
<A NAME="666"></A>and, concealing himself there, escaped those who searched after him. But 
<A NAME="667"></A>to one who knew him, and asked him if he durst not trust his own native 
<A NAME="668"></A>country, he made answer, "In everything else, yes; but in a matter that 
<A NAME="669"></A>touches my life, I would not even my own mother, lest she might by mistake 
<A NAME="670"></A>throw in the black ball instead of the white." When, afterwards, he was 
<A NAME="671"></A>told that the assembly had pronounced judgment of death against him, all 
<A NAME="672"></A>he said was, "I will make them feel that I am alive."
<A NAME="673"></A><BR><BR>The information against him was conceived in this 
<A NAME="674"></A>form:-
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>"Thessalus, the son of Cimon, of the township of Lacia, lays information 
<A NAME="676"></A>that Alcibiades, the son of Clinias of the township of the Scambonidae, 
<A NAME="677"></A>has committed a crime against the goddesses Ceres and Proserpine, by representing 
<A NAME="678"></A>in derision the holy mysteries, and showing them to his companions in his 
<A NAME="679"></A>own house. Where, being habited in such robes as are used by the chief 
<A NAME="680"></A>priest when he shows the holy things, he named himself the chief priest, 
<A NAME="681"></A>Polytion the torch-bearer, and Theodorus, of the township of Phegaea, the 
<A NAME="682"></A>herald; and saluted the rest of his company as Initiates and Novices, all 
<A NAME="683"></A>which was done contrary to the laws and institutions of the Eumolpidae, 
<A NAME="684"></A>and the heralds and priests of the temple at Eleusis."
<A NAME="685"></A><BR><BR>He was condemned as contumacious upon his not appearing, his property 
<A NAME="686"></A>confiscated, and it was decreed that all the priests and priestesses should 
<A NAME="687"></A>solemnly curse him. But one of them, Theano, the daughter of Menon, of 
<A NAME="688"></A>the township of Agraule, is said to have opposed that part of the decree, 
<A NAME="689"></A>saying that her holy office obliged her to make prayers, but not 
<A NAME="690"></A>execrations.
<A NAME="691"></A><BR><BR>Alcibiades, lying under these heavy decrees and sentences, when 
<A NAME="692"></A>first he fled from Thurii, passed over into Peloponnesus and remained some 
<A NAME="693"></A>time at Argos. But being there in fear of his enemies, and seeing himself 
<A NAME="694"></A>utterly hopeless of return to his native country, he sent to Sparta, desiring 
<A NAME="695"></A>safe conduct, and assuring them that he would make them amends by his future 
<A NAME="696"></A>services for all the mischief he had done them while he was their enemy. 
<A NAME="697"></A>The Spartans giving him the security he desired, he went eagerly, was well 
<A NAME="698"></A>received, and, at his very first coming, succeeded in inducing them, without 
<A NAME="699"></A>any further caution or delay, to send aid to the Syracusans; and so roused 
<A NAME="700"></A>and excited them, that they forthwith despatched Gylippus into Sicily to 
<A NAME="701"></A>crush the forces which the Athenians had in Sicily. A second point was 
<A NAME="702"></A>to renew the war upon the Athenians at home. But the third thing, and the 
<A NAME="703"></A>most important of all, was to make them fortify Decelea, which above everything 
<A NAME="704"></A>reduced and wasted the resources of the Athenians.
<A NAME="705"></A><BR><BR>The renown which he earned by these public services was equalled 
<A NAME="706"></A>by the admiration he attracted to his private life; he captivated and won 
<A NAME="707"></A>over everybody by his conformity to Spartan habits. People who saw him 
<A NAME="708"></A>wearing his hair close cut, bathing in cold water, eating coarse meal, 
<A NAME="709"></A>and dining on black broth, doubted, or rather could not believe, that he 
<A NAME="710"></A>ever had a cook in his house, or had ever seen a perfumer, or had worn 
<A NAME="711"></A>a mantle of Milesian purple. For he had, as it was observed, this peculiar 
<A NAME="712"></A>talent and artifice for gaining men's affections, that he could at once 
<A NAME="713"></A>comply with and really embrace and enter into their habits and ways of 
<A NAME="714"></A>life, and change faster than the chameleon. One colour, indeed, they say 
<A NAME="715"></A>the chameleon cannot assume: it cannot itself appear white; but Alcibiades, 
<A NAME="716"></A>whether with good men or with bad, could adapt himself to his company, 
<A NAME="717"></A>and equally wear the appearance of virtue or vice. At Sparta, he was devoted 
<A NAME="718"></A>to athletic exercises, was frugal and reserved; in Ionia, luxurious, gay, 
<A NAME="719"></A>and indolent; in Thrace, always drinking; in Thessaly, ever on horseback; 
<A NAME="720"></A>and when he lived with Tisaphernes the Persian satrap, he exceeded the 
<A NAME="721"></A>Persians themselves in magnificence and pomp. Not that his natural disposition 
<A NAME="722"></A>changed so easily, nor that his real character was so variable, but, whether 
<A NAME="723"></A>he was sensible that by pursuing his own inclinations he might give offence 
<A NAME="724"></A>to those with whom he had occasion to converse, he transformed himself 
<A NAME="725"></A>into any shape, and adopted any fashion, that he observed to be most agreeable 
<A NAME="726"></A>to them. So that to have seen him at Lacedaemon, a man, judging by the 
<A NAME="727"></A>outward appearance, would have said, "'Tis not Achilles's son, but he himself; 
<A NAME="728"></A>the very man" that Lycurgus designed to form; while his real feeling and 
<A NAME="729"></A>acts would have rather provoked the exclamation, "'Tis the same woman still." 
<A NAME="730"></A>For while king Agis was absent, and abroad with the army, he corrupted 
<A NAME="731"></A>his wife Timaea, and had a child born by her. Nor did she even deny it, 
<A NAME="732"></A>but when she was brought to bed of a son, called him in public Leotychides, 
<A NAME="733"></A>but, amongst her confidants and attendants, would whisper that his name 
<A NAME="734"></A>was Alcibiades, to such a degree was she transported by her passion for 
<A NAME="735"></A>him. He, on the other side, would say, in his vain way, he had not done 
<A NAME="736"></A>this thing out of mere wantonness of insult, nor to gratify a passion, 
<A NAME="737"></A>but that his race might one day be kings over the Lacedaemonians.
<A NAME="738"></A><BR><BR>There were many who told Agis that this was so, but time itself 
<A NAME="739"></A>gave the greatest confirmation to the story. For Agis, alarmed by an earthquake, 
<A NAME="740"></A>had quitted his wife, and for ten months after was never with her; Leotychides, 
<A NAME="741"></A>therefore, being born after these ten months, he would not acknowledge 
<A NAME="742"></A>him for his son which was the reason that afterwards he was not admitted 
<A NAME="743"></A>to the succession.
<A NAME="744"></A><BR><BR>After the defeat which the Athenians received in Sicily, ambassadors 
<A NAME="745"></A>were despatched to Sparta at once from Chios and Lesbos and Cyzicus, to 
<A NAME="746"></A>signify their purpose of revolting from the Athenians. The Boeotians interposed 
<A NAME="747"></A>in favour of the Lesbians, and Pharnabazus of the Cyzicenes, but the Lacedaemonians, 
<A NAME="748"></A>at the persuasion of Alcibiades, chose to assist Chios before all others. 
<A NAME="749"></A>He himself, also, went instantly to sea, procured the immediate revolt 
<A NAME="750"></A>of almost all Ionia, and, co-operating with the Lacedaemonian generals, 
<A NAME="751"></A>did great mischief to the Athenians. But Agis was his enemy, hating him 
<A NAME="752"></A>for having dishonoured his wife, and also impatient of his glory, as almost 
<A NAME="753"></A>every enterprise and every success was ascribed to Alcibiades. Others, 
<A NAME="754"></A>also, of the most powerful and ambitious amongst the Spartans were possessed 
<A NAME="755"></A>with jealousy of him, and at last prevailed with the magistrates in the 
<A NAME="756"></A>city to send orders into Ionia that he should be killed. Alcibiades, however, 
<A NAME="757"></A>had secret intelligence of this, and in apprehension of the result, while 
<A NAME="758"></A>he communicated all affairs to the Lacedaemonians, yet took care not to 
<A NAME="759"></A>put himself into their power. At last he retired to Tisaphernes, the King 
<A NAME="760"></A>of Persia's satrap, for his security, and immediately became the first 
<A NAME="761"></A>and most influential person about him. For this barbarian, not being himself 
<A NAME="762"></A>sincere, but a lover of guile and wickedness, admired his address and wonderful 
<A NAME="763"></A>subtlety. And, indeed, the charm of daily intercourse with him was more 
<A NAME="764"></A>than any character could resist or any disposition escape. Even those who 
<A NAME="765"></A>feared and envied him could not but take delight, and have a sort of kindness 
<A NAME="766"></A>for him, when they saw him and were in his company. So that Tisaphernes, 
<A NAME="767"></A>otherwise a cruel character, and, above all other Persians, a hater of 
<A NAME="768"></A>the Greeks, was yet so won by the flatteries of Alcibiades, that he set 
<A NAME="769"></A>himself even to exceed him in responding to them. The most beautiful of 
<A NAME="770"></A>his parks, containing salubrious streams and meadows, where he had built 
<A NAME="771"></A>pavilions, and places of retirement royally and exquisitely adorned, received 
<A NAME="772"></A>by his direction the name of Alcibiades, and was always so called and so 
<A NAME="773"></A>spoken of.
<A NAME="774"></A><BR><BR>Thus Alcibiades, quitting the interests of the Spartans, whom he 
<A NAME="775"></A>could no longer trust, because he stood in fear of Agis, endeavoured to 
<A NAME="776"></A>do them ill offices, and render them odious to Tisaphernes, who by his 
<A NAME="777"></A>means was hindered from assisting them vigorously, and from finally ruining 
<A NAME="778"></A>the Athenians. For his advice was to furnish them but sparingly with money, 
<A NAME="779"></A>and so wear them out, and consume them insensibly; when they had wasted 
<A NAME="780"></A>their strength upon one another, they would both become ready to submit 
<A NAME="781"></A>to the king. Tisaphernes readily pursued his counsel, and so openly expressed 
<A NAME="782"></A>the liking and admiration which he had for him, that Alcibiades was looked 
<A NAME="783"></A>up to by the Greeks of both parties, and the Athenians, now in their misfortunes, 
<A NAME="784"></A>repented them of their severe sentence against him. And he, on the other 
<A NAME="785"></A>side, began to be troubled for them, and to fear lest, if that commonwealth 
<A NAME="786"></A>were utterly destroyed, he should fall into the hands of the Lacedaemonians, 
<A NAME="787"></A>his enemies.
<A NAME="788"></A><BR><BR>At that time the whole strength of the Athenians was in Samos. 
<A NAME="789"></A>Their fleet maintained itself here, and issued from these headquarters 
<A NAME="790"></A>to reduce such as had revolted, and protect the rest of their territories; 
<A NAME="791"></A>in one way or other still contriving to be a match for their enemies at 
<A NAME="792"></A>sea. What they stood in fear of was Tisaphernes and the Phoenician fleet 
<A NAME="793"></A>of one hundred and fifty alleys, which was said to be already under sail; 
<A NAME="794"></A>if those came, there remained then no hopes for the commonwealth of Athens. 
<A NAME="795"></A>Understanding this, Alcibiades sent secretly to the chief men of the Athenians, 
<A NAME="796"></A>who were then at Samos, giving them hopes that he would make Tisaphernes 
<A NAME="797"></A>their friend; he was willing, he implied, to do some favour, not to the 
<A NAME="798"></A>people, not in reliance upon them, but to the better citizens, if only, 
<A NAME="799"></A>like brave men, they would make the attempt to put down the insolence of 
<A NAME="800"></A>the people, and, by taking upon them the government, would endeavour to 
<A NAME="801"></A>save the city from ruin. All of them gave a ready ear to the proposal made 
<A NAME="802"></A>by Alcibiades, except only Phrynichus, of the township of Dirades one of 
<A NAME="803"></A>the generals, who suspected, as the truth was, that Alcibiades concerned 
<A NAME="804"></A>not himself whether the government were in the people or the better citizens, 
<A NAME="805"></A>but only sought by any means to make way for his return into his native 
<A NAME="806"></A>country, and to that end inveighed against the people, thereby to gain 
<A NAME="807"></A>the others, and to insinuate himself into their good opinion. But when 
<A NAME="808"></A>Phrynichus found his counsel to be rejected and that he was himself become 
<A NAME="809"></A>a declared enemy of Alcibiades, he gave secret intelligence to Astyochus, 
<A NAME="810"></A>the enemy's admiral, cautioning him to beware of Alcibiades and to seize 
<A NAME="811"></A>him as a double dealer, unaware that one traitor was making discoveries 
<A NAME="812"></A>to another. For Astyochus, who was eager to gain the favour of Tisaphernes, 
<A NAME="813"></A>observing the credit Alcibiades had with him, revealed to Alcibiades all 
<A NAME="814"></A>that Phrynichus had said against him. Alcibiades at once despatched messengers 
<A NAME="815"></A>to Samos, to accuse Phrynichus of the treachery. Upon this, all the commanders 
<A NAME="816"></A>were enraged with Phrynichus, and set themselves against him; he, seeing 
<A NAME="817"></A>no other way to extricate himself from the present danger, attempted to 
<A NAME="818"></A>remedy one evil by a greater. He sent to Astyochus to reproach him for 
<A NAME="819"></A>betraying him, and to make an offer to him at the same time to deliver 
<A NAME="820"></A>into his hands both the army and the navy of the Athenians. This occasioned 
<A NAME="821"></A>no damage to the Athenians, because Astyochus repeated his treachery and 
<A NAME="822"></A>revealed also this proposal to Alcibiades. But this again was foreseen 
<A NAME="823"></A>by Phrynichus, who, expecting a second accusation from Alcibiades to anticipate 
<A NAME="824"></A>him, advertised the Athenians beforehand that the enemy was ready to sail 
<A NAME="825"></A>in order to surprise them, and therefore advised them to fortify their 
<A NAME="826"></A>camp, and be in a readiness to go aboard their ships. While the Athenians 
<A NAME="827"></A>were intent upon doing these things, they received other letters from Alcibiades, 
<A NAME="828"></A>admonishing them to beware of Phrynichus, as one who designed to betray 
<A NAME="829"></A>their fleet to the enemy, to which they then gave no credit at all, conceiving 
<A NAME="830"></A>that Alcibiades, who knew perfectly the counsels and preparations of the 
<A NAME="831"></A>enemy, was merely making use of that knowledge, in order to impose upon 
<A NAME="832"></A>them in this false accusation of Phrynichus. Yet, afterwards, when Phrynichus 
<A NAME="833"></A>was stabbed with a dagger in the market-place by Hermon, one of the guards, 
<A NAME="834"></A>the Athenians, entering into an examination of the cause, solemnly condemned 
<A NAME="835"></A>Phrynichus of treason, and decreed crowns to Hermon and his associates. 
<A NAME="836"></A>And now the friends of Alcibiades, carrying all before them at Samos, despatched 
<A NAME="837"></A>Pisander to Athens, to attempt a change of government, and to encourage 
<A NAME="838"></A>the aristocratical citizens to take upon themselves the government, and 
<A NAME="839"></A>overthrow the democracy, representing to them, that upon these terms, Alcibiades 
<A NAME="840"></A>would procure them the friendship and alliance of Tisaphernes.
<A NAME="841"></A><BR><BR>This was the colour and pretence made use of by those who desired 
<A NAME="842"></A>to change the government of Athens to an oligarchy. But as soon as they 
<A NAME="843"></A>prevailed, and had got the administration of affairs into their hands, 
<A NAME="844"></A>under the name of the Five Thousand (whereas, indeed, they were but four 
<A NAME="845"></A>hundred), they slighted Alcibiades altogether, and prosecuted the war with 
<A NAME="846"></A>less vigour; partly because they durst not yet trust the citizens, who 
<A NAME="847"></A>secretly detested this change, and partly because they thought the Lacedaemonians, 
<A NAME="848"></A>who always befriended the government of the few, would be inclined to give 
<A NAME="849"></A>them favourable terms.
<A NAME="850"></A><BR><BR>The people in the city were terrified into submission, many of 
<A NAME="851"></A>those who had dared openly to oppose the four hundred having been put to 
<A NAME="852"></A>death. But those who were at Samos, indignant when they heard this news, 
<A NAME="853"></A>were eager to set sail instantly for the Piraeus; sending for Alcibiades, 
<A NAME="854"></A>they declared him general, requiring him to lead them on to put down the 
<A NAME="855"></A>tyrants. He, however, in that juncture, did not, as it might have been 
<A NAME="856"></A>thought a man would, on being suddenly exalted by the favour of a multitude, 
<A NAME="857"></A>think himself under an obligation to gratify and submit to all the wishes 
<A NAME="858"></A>of those who, from a fugitive and an exile, had created him general of 
<A NAME="859"></A>so great an army, and given him the command of such a fleet. But, as became 
<A NAME="860"></A>a great captain, he opposed himself to the precipitate resolutions which 
<A NAME="861"></A>their rage led them to, and, by restraining them from the great error they 
<A NAME="862"></A>were about to commit, unequivocally saved the commonwealth. For if they 
<A NAME="863"></A>then sailed to Athens, all Ionia and the islands and the Hellespont would 
<A NAME="864"></A>have fallen into the enemies' hands without opposition, while the Athenians, 
<A NAME="865"></A>involved in civil war, would have been fighting with one another within 
<A NAME="866"></A>the circuit of their own walls. It was Alcibiades, alone, or, at least, 
<A NAME="867"></A>principally, who prevented all this mischief; for he not only used persuasion 
<A NAME="868"></A>to the whole army, and showed them the danger, but applied himself to them, 
<A NAME="869"></A>one by one, entreating some, and constraining others. He was much assisted, 
<A NAME="870"></A>however, by Thrasybulus of Stiria, who having the loudest voice, as we 
<A NAME="871"></A>are told, of all the Athenians, went along with him, and cried out to those 
<A NAME="872"></A>who were ready to be gone. A second great service which Alcibiades did 
<A NAME="873"></A>for them was, his undertaking that the Phoenician fleet, which the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="874"></A>expected to be sent to them by the King of Persia, should either come in 
<A NAME="875"></A>aid of the Athenians or otherwise should not come at all. He sailed off 
<A NAME="876"></A>with all expedition in order to perform this, and the ships, which had 
<A NAME="877"></A>already been seen as near as Aspendus, were not brought any further by 
<A NAME="878"></A>Tisaphernes, who thus deceived the Lacedaemonians; and it was by both sides 
<A NAME="879"></A>believed that they had been diverted by the procurement of Alcibiades. 
<A NAME="880"></A>The Lacedaemonians, in particular, accused him, that he had advised the 
<A NAME="881"></A>Barbarian to stand still, and suffer the Greeks to waste and destroy one 
<A NAME="882"></A>another, as it was evident that the accession of so great a force to either 
<A NAME="883"></A>party would enable them to take away the entire dominion of the sea from 
<A NAME="884"></A>the other side.
<A NAME="885"></A><BR><BR>Soon after this, the four hundred usurpers were driven out, the 
<A NAME="886"></A>friends of Alcibiades vigorously assisting those who were for the popular 
<A NAME="887"></A>government. And now the people in the city not only desired, but commanded 
<A NAME="888"></A>Alcibiades to return home from his exile. He, however, desired not to owe 
<A NAME="889"></A>his return to the mere grace and commiseration of the people, and resolved 
<A NAME="890"></A>to come back, not with empty hands, but with glory, and after some service 
<A NAME="891"></A>done. To this end, he sailed from Samos with a few ships, and cruised on 
<A NAME="892"></A>the sea of Cnidos, and about the isle of Cos; but receiving intelligence 
<A NAME="893"></A>there that Mindarus, the Spartan admiral, had sailed with his whole army 
<A NAME="894"></A>into the Hellespont, and that the Athenians had followed him, he hurried 
<A NAME="895"></A>back to succour the Athenian commanders, and, by good fortune, arrived 
<A NAME="896"></A>with eighteen galleys at a critical time. For both the fleets having engaged 
<A NAME="897"></A>near Abydos, the fight between them had lasted till night, the one side 
<A NAME="898"></A>having the advantage on one quarter, and the other on another. Upon his 
<A NAME="899"></A>first appearance, both sides formed a false impression; the enemy was encouraged 
<A NAME="900"></A>and the Athenians terrified. But Alcibiades suddenly raised the Athenian 
<A NAME="901"></A>ensign in the admiral ship, and fell upon those galleys of the Peloponnesians 
<A NAME="902"></A>which had the advantage and were in pursuit. He soon put these to flight, 
<A NAME="903"></A>and followed them so close that he forced them on shore, and broke the 
<A NAME="904"></A>ships in pieces, the sailors abandoning them and swimming away in spite 
<A NAME="905"></A>of all the efforts of Pharnabazus, who had come down to their assistance 
<A NAME="906"></A>by land and did what he could to protect them from the shore. In fine, 
<A NAME="907"></A>the Athenians, having taken thirty of the enemy's ships, and recovered 
<A NAME="908"></A>all their own, erected a trophy. After the gaining of so glorious a victory, 
<A NAME="909"></A>his vanity made him eager to show himself to Tisaphernes, and, having furnished 
<A NAME="910"></A>himself with gifts and presents, and an equipage suitable to his dignity, 
<A NAME="911"></A>he set out to visit him. But the thing did not succeed as he had imagined, 
<A NAME="912"></A>for Tisaphernes had been long suspected by the Lacedaemonians, and was 
<A NAME="913"></A>afraid to fall into disgrace with his king upon that account, and therefore 
<A NAME="914"></A>thought that Alcibiades arrived very opportunely, and immediately caused 
<A NAME="915"></A>him to be seized, and sent away prisoner to Sardis; fancying, by this act 
<A NAME="916"></A>of injustice, to clear himself from all former imputations.
<A NAME="917"></A><BR><BR>But about thirty days after, Alcibiades escaped from his keeping, 
<A NAME="918"></A>and having got a horse, fled to Clazomenae, where he procured Tisaphernes 
<A NAME="919"></A>additional disgrace by professing he was a party to his escape. From there 
<A NAME="920"></A>he sailed to the Athenian camp, and, being informed there that Mindarus 
<A NAME="921"></A>and Pharnabazus were together at Cyzicus, he made a speech to the soldiers, 
<A NAME="922"></A>telling them that sea-fighting, land-fighting, and, by the gods, fighting 
<A NAME="923"></A>against fortified cities too, must be all one for them, as unless they 
<A NAME="924"></A>conquered everywhere, there was no money for them. As soon as ever he got 
<A NAME="925"></A>them on shipboard, he hastened to Proconnesus, and gave command to seize 
<A NAME="926"></A>all the small vessels they met, and guard them safely in the interior of 
<A NAME="927"></A>the fleet, that the enemy might have no notice of his coming; and a great 
<A NAME="928"></A>storm of rain, accompanied with thunder and darkness, which happened at 
<A NAME="929"></A>the same time, contributed much to the concealment of his enterprise. Indeed, 
<A NAME="930"></A>it was not only undiscovered by the enemy, but the Athenians themselves 
<A NAME="931"></A>were ignorant of it, for he commanded them suddenly on board, and set sail 
<A NAME="932"></A>when they had abandoned all intention of it. As the darkness presently 
<A NAME="933"></A>passed away, the Peloponnesian fleet was seen riding out at sea in front 
<A NAME="934"></A>of the harbour of Cyzicus. Fearing, if they discovered the number of his 
<A NAME="935"></A>ships, they might endeavour to save themselves by land, he commanded the 
<A NAME="936"></A>rest of the captains to slacken, and follow him slowly, whilst he, advancing 
<A NAME="937"></A>with forty ships, showed himself to the enemy, and provoked them to fight. 
<A NAME="938"></A>The enemy, being deceived as to their numbers, despised them, and, supposing 
<A NAME="939"></A>they were to contend with those only, made themselves ready and began the 
<A NAME="940"></A>fight. But as soon as they were engaged, they perceived the other part 
<A NAME="941"></A>of the fleet coming down upon them, at which they were so terrified that 
<A NAME="942"></A>they fled immediately. Upon that, Alcibiades, breaking through the midst 
<A NAME="943"></A>of them with twenty of his best ships, hastened to the shore, disembarked, 
<A NAME="944"></A>and pursued those who abandoned their ships and fled to land, and made 
<A NAME="945"></A>a great slaughter of them. Mindarus and Pharnabazus, coming to their succour, 
<A NAME="946"></A>were utterly defeated. Mindarus was slain upon the place, fighting valiantly; 
<A NAME="947"></A>Pharnabazus saved himself by flight. The Athenians slew great numbers of 
<A NAME="948"></A>their enemies, won much spoil, and took all their ships. They also made 
<A NAME="949"></A>themselves masters of Cyzicus which was deserted by Pharnabazus, and destroyed 
<A NAME="950"></A>its Peloponnesian garrison, and thereby not only secured to themselves 
<A NAME="951"></A>the Hellespont, but by force drove the Lacedaemonians from out of the rest 
<A NAME="952"></A>of the sea. They intercepted some letters written to the ephors, which 
<A NAME="953"></A>gave an account of this fatal overthrow, after their short laconic manner. 
<A NAME="954"></A>"Our hopes are at an end. Mindarus is slain. The men starve. We know not 
<A NAME="955"></A>what to do."
<A NAME="956"></A><BR><BR>The soldiers who followed Alcibiades in this last fight were so 
<A NAME="957"></A>exalted with their success, and felt that degree of pride, that, looking 
<A NAME="958"></A>on themselves as invincible, they disdained to mix with the other soldiers, 
<A NAME="959"></A>who had been often overcome. For it happened not long before, Thrasyllus 
<A NAME="960"></A>had received a defeat near Ephesus, and, upon that occasion, the Ephesians 
<A NAME="961"></A>erected their brazen trophy to the disgrace of the Athenians. The soldiers 
<A NAME="962"></A>of Alcibiades reproached those who were under the command of Thrasyllus 
<A NAME="963"></A>with this misfortune, at the same time magnifying themselves and their 
<A NAME="964"></A>own commander, and it went so far that they would not exercise with them, 
<A NAME="965"></A>nor lodge in the same quarters. But soon after, Pharnabazus, with a great 
<A NAME="966"></A>force of horse and foot, falling upon the soldiers of Thrasyllus, as they 
<A NAME="967"></A>were laying waste the territory of Abydos, Alcibiades came to their aid, 
<A NAME="968"></A>routed Pharnabazus, and together with Thrasyllus pursued him till it was 
<A NAME="969"></A>night; and in this action the troops united, and returned together to the 
<A NAME="970"></A>camp, rejoicing and congratulating one another. The next day he erected 
<A NAME="971"></A>a trophy, and then proceeded to lay waste with fire and sword the whole 
<A NAME="972"></A>province which was under Pharnabazus, where none ventured to resist; and 
<A NAME="973"></A>he took divers priests and priestesses, but released them without ransom. 
<A NAME="974"></A>He prepared next to attack the Chalcedonians, who had revolted from the 
<A NAME="975"></A>Athenians, and had received a Lacedaemonian governor and garrison. But 
<A NAME="976"></A>having intelligence that they had removed their corn and cattle out of 
<A NAME="977"></A>the fields, and were conveying it all to the Bithynians, who were their 
<A NAME="978"></A>friends, he drew down his army to the frontier of the Bithynians, and then 
<A NAME="979"></A>sent a herald to charge them with this proceeding. The Bithynians, terrified 
<A NAME="980"></A>at his approach, delivered up to him the booty, and entered into alliance 
<A NAME="981"></A>with him.
<A NAME="982"></A><BR><BR>Afterwards he proceeded to the siege of Chalcedon, and enclosed 
<A NAME="983"></A>it with a wall from sea to sea. Pharnabazus advanced with his forces to 
<A NAME="984"></A>raise the siege, and Hypocrites, the governor of the town, at the same 
<A NAME="985"></A>time, gathering together all the strength he had, made a sally upon the 
<A NAME="986"></A>Athenians. Alcibiades divided his army so as to engage both at once, and 
<A NAME="987"></A>not only forced Pharnabazus to a dishonourable flight, but defeated Hypocrites, 
<A NAME="988"></A>and killed him and a number of the soldiers with him. After this he sailed 
<A NAME="989"></A>into the Hellespont, in order to raise supplies of money, and took the 
<A NAME="990"></A>city of Selymbria, in which action, through his precipitation, he exposed 
<A NAME="991"></A>himself to great danger. For some within the town had undertaken to betray 
<A NAME="992"></A>it into his hands, and, by agreement, were to give him a signal by a lighted 
<A NAME="993"></A>torch about midnight. But one of the conspirators beginning to repent himself 
<A NAME="994"></A>of the design, the rest, for fear of being discovered, were driven to give 
<A NAME="995"></A>the signal before the appointed hour. Alcibiades, as soon as he saw the 
<A NAME="996"></A>torch lifted up in the air, though his army was not in readiness to march, 
<A NAME="997"></A>ran instantly towards the walls, taking with him about thirty men only, 
<A NAME="998"></A>and commanding the rest of the army to follow him with all possible speed. 
<A NAME="999"></A>When he came hither, he found the gate opened for him and entered with 
<A NAME="1000"></A>his thirty men, and about twenty more light-armed men, who were come up 
<A NAME="1001"></A>to them. They were no sooner in the city, but he perceived the Selymbrians 
<A NAME="1002"></A>all armed, coming down upon him; so that there was no hope of escaping 
<A NAME="1003"></A>if he stayed to receive them; and, on the other hand, having been always 
<A NAME="1004"></A>successful till that day, wherever he commanded, he could not endure to 
<A NAME="1005"></A>be defeated and fly. So, requiring silence by sound of a trumpet, he commanded 
<A NAME="1006"></A>one of his men to make proclamation that the Selymbrians should not take 
<A NAME="1007"></A>arms against the Athenians. This cooled such of the inhabitants as were 
<A NAME="1008"></A>fiercest for the fight, for they supposed that all their enemies were within 
<A NAME="1009"></A>the walls, and it raised the hopes of others who were disposed to an accommodation. 
<A NAME="1010"></A>Whilst they were parleying, and propositions making on one side and the 
<A NAME="1011"></A>other, Alcibiades's whole army came up to the town. And now, conjecturing 
<A NAME="1012"></A>rightly that the Selymbrians were well inclined to peace, and fearing lest 
<A NAME="1013"></A>the city might be sacked by the Thracians, who came in great numbers to 
<A NAME="1014"></A>his army to serve as volunteers, out of kindness for him, he commanded 
<A NAME="1015"></A>them all to retreat without the walls. And upon the submission of the Selymbrians, 
<A NAME="1016"></A>he saved them from being pillaged, only taking of them a sum of money, 
<A NAME="1017"></A>and, after placing an Athenian garrison in the town, 
<A NAME="1018"></A>departed.
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR><BR>During this action, the Athenian captains who besieged Chalcedon 
<A NAME="1020"></A>concluded a treaty with Pharnabazus upon these articles: That he should 
<A NAME="1021"></A>give them a sum of money; that the Chalcedonians should return to the subjection 
<A NAME="1022"></A>of Athens, and that the Athenians should make no inroad into the province 
<A NAME="1023"></A>whereof Pharnabazus was governor; and Pharnabazus was also to provide safe 
<A NAME="1024"></A>conducts for the Athenian ambassadors to the King of Persia. Afterwards, 
<A NAME="1025"></A>when Alcibiades returned thither, Pharnabazus required that he also should 
<A NAME="1026"></A>be sworn to the treaty; but he refused it, unless Pharnabazus would swear 
<A NAME="1027"></A>at the same time. When the treaty was sworn to on both sides, Alcibiades 
<A NAME="1028"></A>went against the Byzantines, who had revolted from the Athenians, and drew 
<A NAME="1029"></A>a line of circumvallation about the city. But Anaxilaus and Lycurgus, together 
<A NAME="1030"></A>with some others, having undertaken to betray the city to him upon his 
<A NAME="1031"></A>engagement to preserve the lives and property of the inhabitants, he caused 
<A NAME="1032"></A>a report to be spread abroad, as if by reason of some unexpected movement 
<A NAME="1033"></A>in Ionia, he should be obliged to raise the siege. And, accordingly, that 
<A NAME="1034"></A>day he made a show to depart with his whole fleet; but returned the same 
<A NAME="1035"></A>night, and went ashore with all his men at arms, and, silently and undiscovered, 
<A NAME="1036"></A>marched up to the walls. At the same time, his ships rowed into the harbour 
<A NAME="1037"></A>with all possible violence coming on with much fury, and with great shouts 
<A NAME="1038"></A>and outcries. The Byzantines, thus surprised and astonished, while they 
<A NAME="1039"></A>all hurried to the defence of their port and shipping, gave opportunity 
<A NAME="1040"></A>to those who favoured the Athenians securely to receive Alcibiades into 
<A NAME="1041"></A>the city. Yet the enterprise was not accomplished without fighting, for 
<A NAME="1042"></A>the Peloponnesians, Boeotians, and Megarians, not only repulsed those who 
<A NAME="1043"></A>came out of the ships, and forced them on board again, but, hearing that 
<A NAME="1044"></A>the Athenians were entered on the other side, drew up in order, and went 
<A NAME="1045"></A>to meet them. Alcibiades, however, gained the victory after some sharp 
<A NAME="1046"></A>fighting, in which he himself had the command of the right wing, and Theramenes 
<A NAME="1047"></A>of the left, and took about three hundred, who survived of the enemy, prisoners 
<A NAME="1048"></A>of war. After the battle, not one of the Byzantines was slain, or driven 
<A NAME="1049"></A>out of the city, according to the terms upon which the city was put into 
<A NAME="1050"></A>his hands, that they should receive no prejudice in life or property. And 
<A NAME="1051"></A>thus Anaxilaus, being afterwards accused at Lacedaemon for this treason, 
<A NAME="1052"></A>neither disowned nor professed to be ashamed of the action; for he urged 
<A NAME="1053"></A>that he was not a Lacedaemonian, but a Byzantine, and saw not Sparta but 
<A NAME="1054"></A>Byzantium, in extreme danger; the city so blockaded that it was not possible 
<A NAME="1055"></A>to bring in any new provisions, and the Peloponnesians and Boeotians, who 
<A NAME="1056"></A>were in garrison, devouring the old stores, whilst the Byzantines, with 
<A NAME="1057"></A>their wives and children, were starving, that he had not therefore, betrayed 
<A NAME="1058"></A>his country to enemies, but had delivered it from the calamities of war, 
<A NAME="1059"></A>and had but followed the example of the most worthy Lacedaemonians, who 
<A NAME="1060"></A>esteemed nothing to be honourable and just, but what was profitable for 
<A NAME="1061"></A>their country. The Lacedaemonians, upon hearing his defence, respected 
<A NAME="1062"></A>it, and discharged all that were accused.
<A NAME="1063"></A><BR><BR>And now Alcibiades began to desire to see his native country again, 
<A NAME="1064"></A>or rather to show his fellow-citizens a person who had gained so many victories 
<A NAME="1065"></A>for them. He set sail for Athens, the ships that accompanied him being 
<A NAME="1066"></A>adorned with great numbers of shields and other spoils, and towing after 
<A NAME="1067"></A>them many galleys taken from the enemy, and the ensigns and ornaments of 
<A NAME="1068"></A>many others which he had sunk and destroyed; all of them together amounting 
<A NAME="1069"></A>to two hundred. Little credit, perhaps, can be given to what Duris the 
<A NAME="1070"></A>Samian, who professed to be descended from Alcibiades, adds, that Chrysogonus, 
<A NAME="1071"></A>who had gained a victory at the Pythian games, played upon his flute for 
<A NAME="1072"></A>the galleys, whilst the oars kept time with the music; and that Callippides, 
<A NAME="1073"></A>the tragedian, attired in his buskins, his purple robes, and other ornaments 
<A NAME="1074"></A>used in the theatre, gave the word to the rowers, and that the admiral 
<A NAME="1075"></A>galley entered into the port with a purple sail. Neither Theopompus, nor 
<A NAME="1076"></A>Ephorus, nor Xenophon, mention them. Nor, indeed, is it credible, that 
<A NAME="1077"></A>one who returned from so long an exile, and such variety of misfortunes, 
<A NAME="1078"></A>should come home to his countrymen in the style of revellers breaking up 
<A NAME="1079"></A>from a drinking-party. On the contrary, he ventured the harbour full of 
<A NAME="1080"></A>fear, nor would he venture to go on shore, till, standing on the deck, 
<A NAME="1081"></A>he saw Euryptolemus, his cousin, and others of his friends and acquaintance, 
<A NAME="1082"></A>who were ready to receive him, and invited him to land. As soon as he was 
<A NAME="1083"></A>landed, the multitude who came out to meet him scarcely seemed so much 
<A NAME="1084"></A>as to see any of the other captains, but came in throngs about Alcibiades, 
<A NAME="1085"></A>and saluted him with loud acclamations, and still followed him; those who 
<A NAME="1086"></A>could press near him crowned him with garlands, and they who could not 
<A NAME="1087"></A>come up so close yet stayed to behold him afar off, and the old men pointed 
<A NAME="1088"></A>him out, and showed him to the
