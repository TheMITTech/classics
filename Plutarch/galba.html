<BR>(legendary, died 69 A.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>IPHICRATES the Athenian used to say that it is best to have a mercenary 
<A NAME="11"></A>soldier fond of money and of pleasures, for thus he will fight the more 
<A NAME="12"></A>boldly, to procure the means to gratify his desires. But most have been 
<A NAME="13"></A>of opinion, that the body of an army, as well as the natural one, when 
<A NAME="14"></A>in its healthy condition, should make no efforts apart, but in compliance 
<A NAME="15"></A>with its head. Wherefore they tell us that Paulus Aemilius, on taking command 
<A NAME="16"></A>of the forces in Macedonia, and finding them talkative and impertinently 
<A NAME="17"></A>busy, as though they were all commanders, issued out his orders that they 
<A NAME="18"></A>should have only ready hands and keen swords, and leave the rest to him. 
<A NAME="19"></A>And Plato, who can discern use of a good ruler or general if his men are 
<A NAME="20"></A>not on their part obedient and conformable (the virtue of obeying, as of 
<A NAME="21"></A>ruling, being, in his opinion, one that does not exist without first a 
<A NAME="22"></A>noble nature, and then a philosophic education, where the eager and active 
<A NAME="23"></A>powers are allayed with the gentler and humaner sentiments), may claim 
<A NAME="24"></A>in confirmation of his doctrine sundry mournful instances elsewhere, and, 
<A NAME="25"></A>in particular, the events that followed among the Romans upon the death 
<A NAME="26"></A>of Nero, in which plain proofs were given that nothing is more terrible 
<A NAME="27"></A>than a military force moving about in an empire upon uninstructed and unreasoning 
<A NAME="28"></A>impulses. Demades, after the death of Alexander, compared the Macedonian 
<A NAME="29"></A>army to the Cyclops after his eye was out, seeing their many disorderly 
<A NAME="30"></A>and unsteady motions. But the calamities of the Roman government might 
<A NAME="31"></A>be likened to the motions of the giants that assailed heaven, convulsed 
<A NAME="32"></A>as it was, and distracted, and from every side recoiling, as it were, upon 
<A NAME="33"></A>itself, not so much by the ambition of those who were proclaimed emperors, 
<A NAME="34"></A>as by the covetousness and licence of the soldiery, who drove commander 
<A NAME="35"></A>after commander out, like nails one upon another.
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR>Dionysius, in raillery, said of the Pheraean who enjoyed the government 
<A NAME="37"></A>of Thessaly only ten months, that he had been a tragedy-king, but the Caesars' 
<A NAME="38"></A>house in Rome, the Palatium, received in a shorter space of time no less 
<A NAME="39"></A>than four emperors, passing, as it were, across the stage, and one making 
<A NAME="40"></A>room for another to enter.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR><BR>This was the only satisfaction of the distressed, that they need 
<A NAME="42"></A>not require any other justice on their oppressors, seeing them thus murder 
<A NAME="43"></A>each other, and first of all, and that most justly, the one that ensnared 
<A NAME="44"></A>them first, and taught them to expect such happy results from a change 
<A NAME="45"></A>of emperors, sullying a good word by the pay he gave for its being done 
<A NAME="46"></A>and turning revolt against Nero into nothing better than 
<A NAME="47"></A>treason.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>For, as already related, Nymphidius Sabinus, captain of the guards, 
<A NAME="49"></A>together with Tigellinus, after Nero's circumstances were now desperate, 
<A NAME="50"></A>and it was perceived that he designed to fly into Egypt, persuaded the 
<A NAME="51"></A>troops to declare Galba emperor, as if Nero had been already gone, promising 
<A NAME="52"></A>to all the court and praetorian soldiers, as they are called, seven thousand 
<A NAME="53"></A>five hundred drachmas apiece, and to those in service abroad twelve hundred 
<A NAME="54"></A>and fifty drachmas each; so vast a sum for a largess as it was impossible 
<A NAME="55"></A>any one could raise, but he must be infinitely more exacting and oppressive 
<A NAME="56"></A>than ever Nero was. This quickly brought Nero to his grave, and soon after 
<A NAME="57"></A>Galba too; they murdered the first in expectation of the promised gift, 
<A NAME="58"></A>and not long after the other because they did not obtain it from him; and 
<A NAME="59"></A>then, seeking about to find some one who would purchase at such a rate, 
<A NAME="60"></A>they consumed themselves in a succession of treacheries and rebellions 
<A NAME="61"></A>before they obtained their demands. But to give a particular relation of 
<A NAME="62"></A>all that passed would require a history in full form; I have only to notice 
<A NAME="63"></A>what is properly to my purpose, namely, what the Caesars did and 
<A NAME="64"></A>suffered.
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR>Sulpicius Galba is owned by all to have been the richest private 
<A NAME="66"></A>person that ever came to the imperial seat. And besides the additional 
<A NAME="67"></A>honour of being of the Servii, he valued himself more especially for his 
<A NAME="68"></A>relationship to Catulus, the most eminent citizen of his time both for 
<A NAME="69"></A>virtue and renown, however he may have voluntarily yielded to others as 
<A NAME="70"></A>regards power and authority. Galba was also akin to Livia, the wife of 
<A NAME="71"></A>Augustus, by whose interest he was preferred to the consulship by the emperor. 
<A NAME="72"></A>It is said of him that he commanded the troops well in Germany, and, being 
<A NAME="73"></A>made proconsul in Libya, gained a reputation that few ever had. But his 
<A NAME="74"></A>quiet manner of living and his sparingness in expenses and his disregard 
<A NAME="75"></A>of appearances gave him, when he became emperor, an ill-name for meanness, 
<A NAME="76"></A>being, in fact, his worn-out credit for regularity and moderation. He was 
<A NAME="77"></A>entrusted by Nero with the government of Spain, before Nero had yet learned 
<A NAME="78"></A>to be apprehensive of men of great repute. To the opinion, moreover, entertained 
<A NAME="79"></A>of his mild natural temper, his old age added a belief that he would never 
<A NAME="80"></A>act incautiously. There while Nero's iniquitous agents savagely and cruelly 
<A NAME="81"></A>harassed the provinces under Nero's authority, he could afford no succour, 
<A NAME="82"></A>but merely offer this only ease and consolation, that he seemed plainly 
<A NAME="83"></A>to sympathize, as a fellow-sufferer, with those who were condemned upon 
<A NAME="84"></A>suits and sold. And when lampoons were made upon Nero and circulated and 
<A NAME="85"></A>sung everywhere about, he neither prohibited them, nor showed any indignation 
<A NAME="86"></A>on behalf of the emperor's agents, and for this was the more beloved; as 
<A NAME="87"></A>also that he was now well acquainted with them, having been in chief power 
<A NAME="88"></A>there eight years at the time when Junius Vindex, general of the forces 
<A NAME="89"></A>in Gaul, began his insurrection against Nero. And it is reported that letters 
<A NAME="90"></A>came to Galba before it fully broke out into an open rebellion, which he 
<A NAME="91"></A>neither seemed to give credit to, nor on the other hand to take means to 
<A NAME="92"></A>let Nero know; as other officers did, sending to him the letters which 
<A NAME="93"></A>came to them, and so spoiled the design, as much as in them lay, who yet 
<A NAME="94"></A>afterwards shared in the conspiracy, and confessed they had been treacherous 
<A NAME="95"></A>to themselves as well as him. At last Vindex, plainly declaring war, wrote 
<A NAME="96"></A>to Galba, encouraging him to take the government upon him, and give a head 
<A NAME="97"></A>to this strong body, the Gaulish provinces, which could already count a 
<A NAME="98"></A>hundred thousand men in arms, and were able to arm a yet greater number 
<A NAME="99"></A>if occasion were. Galba laid the matter before his friends, some of whom 
<A NAME="100"></A>thought it fit to wait, and see what movement there might be and what inclinations 
<A NAME="101"></A>displayed at Rome for the revolution. But Titus Vinius, captain of his 
<A NAME="102"></A>praetorian guard, spoke thus: "Galba, what means this inquiry? To question 
<A NAME="103"></A>whether we shall continue faithful to Nero is, in itself, to cease to be 
<A NAME="104"></A>faithful. Nero is our enemy, and we must by no means decline the help of 
<A NAME="105"></A>Vindex: or else we must at once denounce him, and march to attack him, 
<A NAME="106"></A>because he wishes you to be the governor of the Romans, rather than Nero 
<A NAME="107"></A>their tyrant." Thereupon Galba, by an edict, appointed a day when he would 
<A NAME="108"></A>receive manumissions, and general rumour and talk beforehand about his 
<A NAME="109"></A>purpose brought together a great crowd of men so ready for a change, that 
<A NAME="110"></A>he scarcely appeared, stepping up to the tribunal, but they with one consent 
<A NAME="111"></A>saluted him emperor. That title he refused at present to take upon him; 
<A NAME="112"></A>but after he had a while inveighed against Nero and bemoaned the loss of 
<A NAME="113"></A>the more conspicuous of those that had been destroyed by him, he offered 
<A NAME="114"></A>himself and service to his country, not by the titles of Caesar or emperor, 
<A NAME="115"></A>but as the lieutenant of the Roman senate and people.
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR>Now that Vindex did wisely in inviting Galba to the empire, Nero 
<A NAME="117"></A>himself bore testimony; who, though he seemed to despise Vindex and altogether 
<A NAME="118"></A>to slight the Gauls and their concerns, yet when he heard of Galba (as 
<A NAME="119"></A>by chance he had just bathed and sat down to his morning meal), at this 
<A NAME="120"></A>news he overturned the table. But the senate having voted Galba an enemy, 
<A NAME="121"></A>presently, to make his jest, and likewise to personate a confidence among 
<A NAME="122"></A>his friends, "This is a very happy opportunity," he said, "for me, who 
<A NAME="123"></A>sadly want such a booty as that of the Gauls, which must all fall in as 
<A NAME="124"></A>lawful prize; and Galba's estate I can use or sell at once, he being now 
<A NAME="125"></A>an open enemy." And accordingly he had Galba's property exposed to sale, 
<A NAME="126"></A>which when Galba heard of, he sequestered all that was Nero's in Spain, 
<A NAME="127"></A>and found far readier bidders.
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR>Many now began to revolt from Nero, and pretty nearly all adhered 
<A NAME="129"></A>to Galba; only Clodius Macer in Africa, and Virginius Rufus, commander 
<A NAME="130"></A>of the German forces in Gaul, followed counsel of their own; yet these 
<A NAME="131"></A>two were not of one and the same advice, for Clodius, being sensible of 
<A NAME="132"></A>the rapines and murders to which he had been led by cruelty and covetousness, 
<A NAME="133"></A>was in perplexity, and felt it was not safe for him either to retain or 
<A NAME="134"></A>quit his command. But Virginius, who had the command of the strongest legions, 
<A NAME="135"></A>by whom he was many repeated times saluted emperor and pressed to take 
<A NAME="136"></A>the title upon him, declared that he neither would assume that honour himself, 
<A NAME="137"></A>nor see it given to any other than whom the senate should 
<A NAME="138"></A>elect.
<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR>These things at first did not a little disturb Galba, but when 
<A NAME="140"></A>presently Virginius and Vindex were in a manner forced by their armies, 
<A NAME="141"></A>having got the reins, as it were, out of their hands, to a great encounter 
<A NAME="142"></A>and battle, in which Vindex, having seen twenty thousand of the Gauls destroyed, 
<A NAME="143"></A>died by his own hand, and when the report straight spread abroad, that 
<A NAME="144"></A>all desired Virginius, after this great victory, to take the empire upon 
<A NAME="145"></A>him, or else they would return to Nero again, Galba, in great alarm at 
<A NAME="146"></A>this, wrote to Virginius, exhorting him to join with him for the preservation 
<A NAME="147"></A>of the empire and the liberty of the Romans, and so retiring with his friends 
<A NAME="148"></A>into Clunia, a town in Spain, he passed away his time, rather repenting 
<A NAME="149"></A>his former rashness, and wishing for his wonted ease and privacy, than 
<A NAME="150"></A>setting about what was fit to be done.
<A NAME="151"></A><BR><BR>It was now summer, when on a sudden, a little before dusk, comes 
<A NAME="152"></A>a freedman Icelus by name, having arrived in seven days from Rome; and 
<A NAME="153"></A>being informed where Galba was reposing himself in private, he went straight 
<A NAME="154"></A>on, and pushing by the servants of the chamber, opened the door and entered 
<A NAME="155"></A>the room, and told him, that Nero being yet alive but not appearing, first 
<A NAME="156"></A>the army, and then the people and senate, declared Galba emperor; not long 
<A NAME="157"></A>after, it was reported that Nero was dead; "but I," said he, "not giving 
<A NAME="158"></A>credit to common fame, went myself to the body and saw him lying dead, 
<A NAME="159"></A>and only then set out to bring you word." This news at once made Galba 
<A NAME="160"></A>great again, and a crowd of people came hastening to the door, all very 
<A NAME="161"></A>confident of the truth of his tidings, though the speed of the man was 
<A NAME="162"></A>almost incredible. Two days after came Titus Vinius with sundry others 
<A NAME="163"></A>from the camp, who gave an account in detail of the orders of the senate, 
<A NAME="164"></A>and for this service was considerably advanced. On the freedman, Galba 
<A NAME="165"></A>conferred the honour of the gold ring, and Icelus, as he had been before, 
<A NAME="166"></A>now taking the name of Marcianus, held the first place of the 
<A NAME="167"></A>freedmen.
<A NAME="168"></A><BR><BR>But at Rome, Nymphidius Sabinus, not gently, and little by little, 
<A NAME="169"></A>but at once, and without exception, engrossed all power to himself; Galba, 
<A NAME="170"></A>being an old man (seventy-three years of age), would scarcely, he thought, 
<A NAME="171"></A>live long enough to be carried in a litter to Rome; and the troops in the 
<A NAME="172"></A>city were from old time attached to him, and now bound by the vastness 
<A NAME="173"></A>of the promised gift, for which they regarded him as their benefactor, 
<A NAME="174"></A>and Galba as their debtor. Thus presuming on his interest, he straightway 
<A NAME="175"></A>commanded Tigellinus, who was in joint commission with himself, to lay 
<A NAME="176"></A>down his sword; and giving entertainments, he invited the former consuls 
<A NAME="177"></A>and commanders, making use of Galba's name for the invitation; but at the 
<A NAME="178"></A>same time prepared many in the camp to propose that a request should be 
<A NAME="179"></A>sent to Galba that he should appoint Nymphidius sole prefect for life without 
<A NAME="180"></A>a colleague. And the modes which the senate took to show him honour and 
<A NAME="181"></A>increase his power, styling him their benefactor, and attending daily at 
<A NAME="182"></A>his gates, and giving him the compliment of heading with his own name and 
<A NAME="183"></A>confirming all their acts, carried him on to a yet greater degree of arrogance, 
<A NAME="184"></A>so that in a short time he became an object, not only of dislike, but of 
<A NAME="185"></A>terror, to those that sought his favour. When the consuls themselves had 
<A NAME="186"></A>despatched their couriers with the decrees of the senate to the emperor, 
<A NAME="187"></A>together with the sealed diplomas, which the authorities in all the towns 
<A NAME="188"></A>where horses or carriages are changed look at, and on that certificate 
<A NAME="189"></A>hasten the courtiers forward with all their means, he was highly displeased 
<A NAME="190"></A>that his seal had not been used, and none of his soldiers employed on the 
<A NAME="191"></A>errand. Nay, he even deliberated what course to take with the consuls themselves, 
<A NAME="192"></A>but upon their submission and apology he was at last pacified. To gratify 
<A NAME="193"></A>the people, he did not interfere with their beating to death any that fell 
<A NAME="194"></A>into their hands of Nero's party. Amongst others, Spiclus, the gladiator, 
<A NAME="195"></A>was killed in the forum by being thrown under Nero's statues, which they 
<A NAME="196"></A>dragged about the place over his body. Aponius, one of those who had been 
<A NAME="197"></A>concerned in accusations, they knocked to the ground, and drove carts loaded 
<A NAME="198"></A>with stones over him. And many others they tore in pieces, some of them 
<A NAME="199"></A>no way guilty, insomuch that Mauriscus, a person of great account and character, 
<A NAME="200"></A>told the senate that he feared, in a short time, they might wish for Nero 
<A NAME="201"></A>again.
<A NAME="202"></A><BR><BR>Nymphidius, now advancing towards the consummation of his hopes, 
<A NAME="203"></A>did not refuse to let it be said that he was the son of Caius Caesar, Tiberius's 
<A NAME="204"></A>successor; who, it is told, was well acquainted with his mother in his 
<A NAME="205"></A>early youth, a woman indeed handsome enough, the offspring of Callistus, 
<A NAME="206"></A>one of Caesar's freedmen, and a certain sempstress. But it is plain that 
<A NAME="207"></A>Caius's familiarity with his mother was of too late date to give him any 
<A NAME="208"></A>pretensions, and it was suspected he might, if he pleased, claim a father 
<A NAME="209"></A>in Martianus, the gladiator, whom his mother, Nymphidia, took a passion 
<A NAME="210"></A>for, being a famous man in his way, whom also he much more resembled. However, 
<A NAME="211"></A>though he certainly owned Nymphidia for his mother, he ascribed meantime 
<A NAME="212"></A>the downfall of Nero to himself alone, and thought he was not sufficiently 
<A NAME="213"></A>rewarded with the honours and riches he enjoyed (nay, though to all was 
<A NAME="214"></A>added the company of Sporus, whom he immediately sent for while Nero's 
<A NAME="215"></A>body was yet burning on the pile, and treated as his consort with the name 
<A NAME="216"></A>of Poppaea), but he must also aspire to the empire. And at Rome he had 
<A NAME="217"></A>friends who took measures for him secretly, as well as some women and some 
<A NAME="218"></A>members of the senate also, who worked underhand to assist him. And into 
<A NAME="219"></A>Spain he despatched one of his friends, named Gellianus, to view the posture 
<A NAME="220"></A>of affairs.
<A NAME="221"></A><BR><BR>But all things succeeded well with Galba after Nero's death; only 
<A NAME="222"></A>Virginius Rufus, still standing doubtful, gave him some anxiety, lest he 
<A NAME="223"></A>should listen to the suggestions of some who encouraged him to take the 
<A NAME="224"></A>government upon him, having, at present, besides the command of a large 
<A NAME="225"></A>and warlike army, the new honours of the defeat of Vindex and the subjugation 
<A NAME="226"></A>of one considerable part of the Roman empire, namely, the entire Gaul, 
<A NAME="227"></A>which had seemed shaking about upon the verge of open revolt. Nor had any 
<A NAME="228"></A>man indeed a greater name and reputation than Virginius, who had taken 
<A NAME="229"></A>a part of so much consequence in the deliverance of the empire at once 
<A NAME="230"></A>from a cruel tyranny and a Gallic war. But he, standing to his first resolves, 
<A NAME="231"></A>reserved to the senate the power of electing an emperor. Yet when it was 
<A NAME="232"></A>now manifest that Nero was dead, the soldiers pressed him hard to it, and 
<A NAME="233"></A>one of the tribunes, entering his tent with his drawn sword, bade him either 
<A NAME="234"></A>take the government or that. But after Fabius Valens, having the command 
<A NAME="235"></A>of one legion, had first sworn fealty to Galba, and letters from Rome came 
<A NAME="236"></A>with tidings of the resolves of the senate, at last with much ado he persuaded 
<A NAME="237"></A>the army to declare Galba emperor. And when Flaccus Hordeonius came by 
<A NAME="238"></A>Galba's commission as Galba successor, he handed over to him his forces, 
<A NAME="239"></A>and went himself to meet Galba on his way, and having met him turned back 
<A NAME="240"></A>to attend him; in all which no apparent displeasure nor yet honour was 
<A NAME="241"></A>shown him. Galba's feelings of respect for him prevented the former; the 
<A NAME="242"></A>latter was checked by the envy of his friends, and particularly of Titus 
<A NAME="243"></A>Vinius, who, acting in the desire of hindering Virginius's promotion, unwittingly 
<A NAME="244"></A>aided his happy genius in rescuing him from those hazards and hardships 
<A NAME="245"></A>which other commanders were involved in, and securing him the safe enjoyment 
<A NAME="246"></A>of a quiet life and peaceable old age.
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR>Near Narbo, a city in Gaul, the deputation of the senate met Galba, 
<A NAME="248"></A>and after they had delivered their compliments, begged him to make what 
<A NAME="249"></A>haste he could to appear to the people that impatiently expected him. He 
<A NAME="250"></A>discoursed with them courteously and unassumingly, and in his entertainment, 
<A NAME="251"></A>though Nymphidius had sent him royal furniture and attendance of Nero's, 
<A NAME="252"></A>he put all aside, and made use of nothing but his own, for which he was 
<A NAME="253"></A>well spoken of, as one who had a great mind, and was superior to little 
<A NAME="254"></A>vanities. But in a short time, Vinius, by declaring to him that these noble, 
<A NAME="255"></A>unpompous, citizen-like ways were a mere affectation of popularity and 
<A NAME="256"></A>a petty bashfulness at assuming his proper greatness, induced him to make 
<A NAME="257"></A>use of Nero's supplies, and in his entertainments not to be afraid of a 
<A NAME="258"></A>regal sumptuosity. And in more than one way the old man let it gradually 
<A NAME="259"></A>appear that he had put himself under Vinius's disposal.
<A NAME="260"></A><BR><BR>Vinius was a person of an excessive covetousness, and not quite 
<A NAME="261"></A>free from blame in respect to women. For being a young man, newly entered 
<A NAME="262"></A>into the service under Calvisius Sabinus, upon his first campaign, he brought 
<A NAME="263"></A>his commander's wife, a licentious woman, in a soldier's dress, by night 
<A NAME="264"></A>into the camp, and was found with her in the very general's quarters, the 
<A NAME="265"></A>principia, as the Romans call them. For which insolence Caius Caesar cast 
<A NAME="266"></A>him into prison, from whence he was fortunately delivered by Caius's death. 
<A NAME="267"></A>Afterwards, being invited by Claudius Caesar to supper, he privily conveyed 
<A NAME="268"></A>away a silver cup, which Caesar hearing of, invited him again the next 
<A NAME="269"></A>day, and gave order to his servants to set before him no silver plate, 
<A NAME="270"></A>but only earthenware. And this offence, through the comic mildness of Caesar's 
<A NAME="271"></A>reprimand, was treated rather as a subject of jest than as a crime. But 
<A NAME="272"></A>the acts to which now, when Galba was in his hands and his power was so 
<A NAME="273"></A>extensive, his covetous temper led him were the causes, in part, and in 
<A NAME="274"></A>part the provocation, of tragical and fatal mischiefs.
<A NAME="275"></A><BR><BR>Nymphidius became very uneasy upon the return out of Spain of Gellianus 
<A NAME="276"></A>whom he had sent to pry into Galba's actions, understanding that Cornelius 
<A NAME="277"></A>Laco was appointed commander of the court guards, and that Vinius was the 
<A NAME="278"></A>great favourite, and that Gellianus had not been able so much as to come 
<A NAME="279"></A>nigh, much less have any opportunity to offer any words in private, so 
<A NAME="280"></A>narrowly had he been watched and observed. Nymphidius, therefore, called 
<A NAME="281"></A>together the officers of the troops, and declared to them that Galba of 
<A NAME="282"></A>himself was a good, well-meaning old man, but did not act by his own counsel, 
<A NAME="283"></A>and was ill-guided by Vinius and Laco; and lest, before they were aware, 
<A NAME="284"></A>they should engross the authority Tigellinus had with the troops, he proposed 
<A NAME="285"></A>to them to send deputies from the camp acquainting him that if he pleased 
<A NAME="286"></A>to remove only these two from his counsel and presence, he would be much 
<A NAME="287"></A>more welcome to all at his arrival. Wherein, when he saw he did not prevail 
<A NAME="288"></A>(it seeming absurd and unmannerly to give rules to an old commander what 
<A NAME="289"></A>friends to retain or displace, as if he had been a youth newly taking the 
<A NAME="290"></A>reins of authority into his hands), adopting another course, he wrote himself 
<A NAME="291"></A>to Galba letters in alarming terms, one while as if the city were unsettled, 
<A NAME="292"></A>and had not yet recovered its tranquillity; then that Clodius Macer withheld 
<A NAME="293"></A>the corn-ships from Africa; that the legions in Germany began to be mutinous, 
<A NAME="294"></A>and that he heard the like of those in Syria and Judaea. But Galba not 
<A NAME="295"></A>minding him much or giving credit to his stories, he resolved to make his 
<A NAME="296"></A>attempt beforehand, though Clodius Celsus, a native of Antioch, a person 
<A NAME="297"></A>of sense, and friendly and faithful to Nymphidius, told him he was wrong, 
<A NAME="298"></A>saying he did not believe one single street in Rome would ever give him 
<A NAME="299"></A>the title of Caesar. Nevertheless many also derided Galba, amongst the 
<A NAME="300"></A>rest Mithridates of Pontus, saying, that as soon as this wrinkled, baldheaded 
<A NAME="301"></A>man should be seen publicly at Rome, they would think it an utter disgrace 
<A NAME="302"></A>even to have had such a Caesar.
<A NAME="303"></A><BR><BR>At last it was resolved, about midnight, to bring Nymphidius into 
<A NAME="304"></A>the camp, and declare him emperor. But Antonius Honoratus, who was first 
<A NAME="305"></A>among the tribunes, summoning together in the evening those under his command, 
<A NAME="306"></A>charged himself and them severely with their many and unreasonable turns 
<A NAME="307"></A>and alterations, made without any purpose or regard to merit, simply as 
<A NAME="308"></A>if some evil genius hurried them from one reason to another. "What though 
<A NAME="309"></A>Nero's miscarriages," said he, "gave some colour to your former acts, can 
<A NAME="310"></A>you say you have any plea for betraying Galba in the death of a mother, 
<A NAME="311"></A>the blood of a wife, or the degradation of the imperial power upon the 
<A NAME="312"></A>stage and amongst players? Neither did we desert Nero for all this, until 
<A NAME="313"></A>Nymphidius had persuaded us that he had first left us and fled into Egypt. 
<A NAME="314"></A>Shall we, therefore, send Galba after, to appease Nero's shade, and, for 
<A NAME="315"></A>the sake of making the son of Nymphidia emperor, take off one of Livia's 
<A NAME="316"></A>family, as we have already the son of Agrippina? Rather, doing justice 
<A NAME="317"></A>on him, let us revenge Nero's death, and show ourselves true and faithful 
<A NAME="318"></A>by preserving Galba."
<A NAME="319"></A><BR><BR>The tribune having ended his harangue, the soldiers assented, and 
<A NAME="320"></A>encouraged all they met with to persist in their fidelity to the emperor, 
<A NAME="321"></A>and, indeed, brought over the greatest part. But presently hearing a great 
<A NAME="322"></A>shout, Nymphidius, imagining, as some say, that the soldiers called for 
<A NAME="323"></A>him, or hastening to be in time to check any opposition and gain the doubtful, 
<A NAME="324"></A>came on with many lights, carrying in his hand a speech in writing, made 
<A NAME="325"></A>by Cingonius Varro, which he had got by heart, to deliver to the soldiers. 
<A NAME="326"></A>But seeing the gates of the camp shut up, and large numbers standing armed 
<A NAME="327"></A>about the walls, he began to be afraid. Yet drawing nearer he demanded 
<A NAME="328"></A>what they meant, and by whose orders they were then in arms; but hearing 
<A NAME="329"></A>a general acclamation, all with one consent crying out that Galba was their 
<A NAME="330"></A>emperor, advancing towards them, he joined in the cry, and likewise commanded 
<A NAME="331"></A>those that followed him to do the same. The guard notwithstanding permitted 
<A NAME="332"></A>him to enter the camp only with a few, where he was presently struck with 
<A NAME="333"></A>a dart, which Septimius, being before him, received on his shield; others, 
<A NAME="334"></A>however, assaulted him with their naked swords, and on his flying, pursued 
<A NAME="335"></A>him into a soldier's cabin, where they slew him. And dragging his body 
<A NAME="336"></A>thence, they placed a railing about it, and exposed it next day to public 
<A NAME="337"></A>view. When Galba heard of the end which Nymphidius had thus come to, he 
<A NAME="338"></A>commanded that all his confederates who had not at once killed themselves 
<A NAME="339"></A>should immediately be despatched; amongst whom were Cingonius, who made 
<A NAME="340"></A>his oration, and Mithridates, formerly mentioned. It was, however, regarded 
<A NAME="341"></A>as arbitrary and illegal, and though it might be just, yet by no means 
<A NAME="342"></A>popular, to take off men of their rank and equality without a hearing. 
<A NAME="343"></A>For every one expected another scheme of government, being deceived, as 
<A NAME="344"></A>is usual, by the first plausible pretences; and the death of Petronius 
<A NAME="345"></A>Turpilianus, who was of consular dignity, and had remained faithful to 
<A NAME="346"></A>Nero, was yet more keenly resented. Indeed, the taking off of Macer in 
<A NAME="347"></A>Africa by Trebonius, and Fonteius by Valens in Germany, had a fair pretence, 
<A NAME="348"></A>they being dreaded as armed commanders, having their soldiers at their 
<A NAME="349"></A>bidding; but why refuse Turpilianus, an old man and unarmed, permission 
<A NAME="350"></A>to try to clear himself, if any part of the moderation and equity at first 
<A NAME="351"></A>promised were really to come to a performance? Such were the comments to 
<A NAME="352"></A>which these actions exposed him. When he came within five-and-twenty furlongs 
<A NAME="353"></A>or thereabouts of the city, he happened to light on a disorderly rabble 
<A NAME="354"></A>of the seamen, who beset him as he passed. These were they whom Nero made 
<A NAME="355"></A>soldiers, forming them into a legion. They so rudely crowded to have their 
<A NAME="356"></A>commission confirmed that they did not let Galba either be seen or heard 
<A NAME="357"></A>by those that had come out to meet their new emperor; but tumultuously 
<A NAME="358"></A>pressed on with loud shouts to have colours to their legion, and quarters 
<A NAME="359"></A>assigned them. Galba put them off until another time, which they interpreted 
<A NAME="360"></A>as a denial, grew more insolent and mutinous, following and crying out, 
<A NAME="361"></A>some with their drawn swords in their hands. Upon seeing which, Galba commanded 
<A NAME="362"></A>the horse to ride over them, when they were soon routed, not a man standing 
<A NAME="363"></A>his ground, and many of them were slain, both there and in the pursuit; 
<A NAME="364"></A>an ill-omen, that Galba should make his first entry through so much blood 
<A NAME="365"></A>and among dead bodies. And now he was looked upon with terror and alarm 
<A NAME="366"></A>by any one who had entertained contempt of him at the sight of his age 
<A NAME="367"></A>and apparent infirmities.
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR>But when he desired presently to let it appear what a change would 
<A NAME="369"></A>be made from Nero's profuseness and sumptuosity in giving presents, he 
<A NAME="370"></A>much missed his aim, and fell so short of magnificence, that he scarcely 
<A NAME="371"></A>came within the limits of decency. When Canus, who was a famous musician, 
<A NAME="372"></A>played at supper for him, he expressed his approbation, and bade the bag 
<A NAME="373"></A>he brought to him; and taking a few gold pieces, put them in with this 
<A NAME="374"></A>remark, that it was out of his own purse, and not on the public account. 
<A NAME="375"></A>He ordered the largess which Nero had made to actors and wrestlers and 
<A NAME="376"></A>such like to be strictly required again, allowing only the tenth part to 
<A NAME="377"></A>be retained; though it turned to very small account, most of those persons 
<A NAME="378"></A>expending their daily income as fast as they received it, being rude, improvident 
<A NAME="379"></A>livers; upon which he had further inquiry made as to those who had bought 
<A NAME="380"></A>or received from them, and called upon these people to refund. The trouble 
<A NAME="381"></A>was infinite, the exactions being prosecuted far, touching a great number 
<A NAME="382"></A>of persons, bringing disrepute on Galba, and general hatred on Vinius, 
<A NAME="383"></A>who made the emperor appear base-hearted and mean to the world, whilst 
<A NAME="384"></A>he himself was spending profusely, taking whatever he could get, and selling 
<A NAME="385"></A>to any buyer. Hesiod tells us to drink without stinting 
<A NAME="386"></A>of-
<A NAME="387"></A><BR><BR>"The end and the beginning of the cask." And Vinius, seeing his 
<A NAME="388"></A>patron old and decaying, made the most of what he considered to be at once 
<A NAME="389"></A>the first of his fortune and the last of it.
<A NAME="390"></A><BR><BR>Thus the aged man suffered in two ways, first, through the evil 
<A NAME="391"></A>deeds which Vinius did himself, and, next, by his preventing or bringing 
<A NAME="392"></A>into disgrace those just acts which he himself designed. Such was the punishing 
<A NAME="393"></A>Nero's adherents. When he destroyed the bad, amongst whom were Helius, 
<A NAME="394"></A>Polycletus, Petinus, and Patrobius, the people mightily applauded the act, 
<A NAME="395"></A>crying out, as they were dragged through the forum, that it was a goodly 
<A NAME="396"></A>sight, grateful to the gods themselves, adding, however, that the gods 
<A NAME="397"></A>and men alike demanded justice on Tigellinus, the very tutor and prompter 
<A NAME="398"></A>of all the tyranny. This good man, however, had taken his measures beforehand, 
<A NAME="399"></A>in the shape of a present and a promise to Vinius. Turpilianus could not 
<A NAME="400"></A>be allowed to escape with life, though his one and only crime had been 
<A NAME="401"></A>that he had not betrayed or shown hatred to such a ruler as Nero. But he 
<A NAME="402"></A>who had made Nero what he became, and afterwards deserted and betrayed 
<A NAME="403"></A>him whom he had so corrupted, was allowed to survive as an instance that 
<A NAME="404"></A>Vinius could do anything, and an advertisement that those that had money 
<A NAME="405"></A>to give him need despair of nothing. The people, however, were so possessed 
<A NAME="406"></A>with the desire of seeing Tigellinus dragged to execution, that they never 
<A NAME="407"></A>ceased to require it at the theatre, and in the race-course, till they 
<A NAME="408"></A>were checked by an edict from the emperor himself, announcing that Tigellinus 
<A NAME="409"></A>could not live long, being wasted with a consumption, and requesting them 
<A NAME="410"></A>not to seek to make his government appear cruel and tyrannical. So the 
<A NAME="411"></A>dissatisfied populace were laughed at, and Tigellinus made a splendid feast, 
<A NAME="412"></A>and sacrificed in thanksgiving for his deliverance; and after supper, Vinius, 
<A NAME="413"></A>rising from the emperor's table, went to revel with Tigellinus, taking 
<A NAME="414"></A>his daughter, a widow, with him; to whom Tigellinus presented his compliments, 
<A NAME="415"></A>with a gift of twenty-five myriads of money, and bade the superintendent 
<A NAME="416"></A>of his concubines take off a rich necklace from her own neck and tie it 
<A NAME="417"></A>about hers, the value of it being estimated at fifteen 
<A NAME="418"></A>myriads.
<A NAME="419"></A><BR><BR>After this, even reasonable acts were censured; as, for example, 
<A NAME="420"></A>the treatment of the Gauls who had been in the conspiracy with Vindex. 
<A NAME="421"></A>For people looked upon their abatement of tribute and admission to citizenship 
<A NAME="422"></A>as a piece, not of clemency on the part of Galba, but of money-making on 
<A NAME="423"></A>that of Vinius. And thus the mass of the people began to look with dislike 
<A NAME="424"></A>upon the government. The soldiers were kept on a while in expectation of 
<A NAME="425"></A>the promised donative, supposing that if they did not receive the full, 
<A NAME="426"></A>yet they should have at least as much as Nero gave them. But when Galba, 
<A NAME="427"></A>on hearing they began to complain, declared greatly, and like a general, 
<A NAME="428"></A>that he was used to enlist and not to buy his soldiers, when they heard 
<A NAME="429"></A>of this, they conceived an implacable hatred against him; for he did not 
<A NAME="430"></A>seem to defraud them merely himself in their present expectations, but 
<A NAME="431"></A>to give an ill precedent, and instruct his successors to do the like. This 
<A NAME="432"></A>heart-burning, however, was as yet at Rome a thing undeclared, and a certain 
<A NAME="433"></A>respect for Galba's personal presence somewhat retarded their motions, 
<A NAME="434"></A>and took off their edge, and their having no obvious occasion for beginning 
<A NAME="435"></A>a revolution curbed and kept under, more or less, their resentments. But 
<A NAME="436"></A>those forces that had been formerly under Virginius, and now were under 
<A NAME="437"></A>Flaccus in Germany, valuing themselves much upon the battle they had fought 
<A NAME="438"></A>with Vindex, and finding now no advantage of it, grew very refractory and 
<A NAME="439"></A>intractable towards their officers; and Flaccus they wholly disregarded, 
<A NAME="440"></A>being incapacitated in body by unintermitted gout, and, besides, a man 
<A NAME="441"></A>of little experience in affairs. So at one of their festivals, when it 
<A NAME="442"></A>was customary for the officers of the army to wish all health and happiness 
<A NAME="443"></A>to the emperor, the common soldiers began to murmur loudly, and on their 
<A NAME="444"></A>officers persisting in the ceremony, responded with the words, "If he deserves 
<A NAME="445"></A>it."
<A NAME="446"></A><BR><BR>When some similar insolence was committed by the legions under 
<A NAME="447"></A>Vitellius, frequent letters with the information came to Galba from his 
<A NAME="448"></A>agents; and taking alarm at this, and fearing that he might be despised 
<A NAME="449"></A>not only for his old age, but also for want of issue, he determined to 
<A NAME="450"></A>adopt some young man of distinction, and declare him his successor. There 
<A NAME="451"></A>was at this time in the city Marcus Otho, a person of fair extraction, 
<A NAME="452"></A>but from his childhood one of the few most debauched, voluptuous, and luxurious 
<A NAME="453"></A>livers in Rome. And as Homer gives Paris in several places the title of 
<A NAME="454"></A>"fair Helen's love," making a woman's name the glory and addition to his, 
<A NAME="455"></A>as if he had nothing else to distinguish him, so Otho was renowned in Rome 
<A NAME="456"></A>for nothing more than his marriage with Poppaea, whom Nero had a passion 
<A NAME="457"></A>for when she was Crispinus's wife. But being as yet respectful to his own 
<A NAME="458"></A>wife, and standing in awe of his mother, he engaged Otho underhand to solicit 
<A NAME="459"></A>her. For Nero lived familiarly with Otho, whose prodigality won his favour, 
<A NAME="460"></A>and he was well pleased when he took the freedom to jest upon him as mean 
<A NAME="461"></A>and penurious. Thus when Nero one day perfumed himself with some rich essence 
<A NAME="462"></A>and favoured Otho with a sprinkle of it, he, entertaining Nero next day, 
<A NAME="463"></A>ordered gold and silver pipes to disperse the like on a sudden freely, 
<A NAME="464"></A>like water, throughout the room. As to Poppaea, he was beforehand with 
<A NAME="465"></A>Nero, and first seducing her himself, then, with the hope of Nero's favour, 
<A NAME="466"></A>he prevailed with her to part with her husband, and brought her to his 
<A NAME="467"></A>own house as his wife, and was not content afterwards to have a share in 
<A NAME="468"></A>her, but grudged to have Nero for a claimant, Poppaea herself, they say, 
<A NAME="469"></A>being rather pleased than otherwise with this jealousy; she sometimes excluded 
<A NAME="470"></A>Nero, even when Otho was not present, either to prevent his getting tired 
<A NAME="471"></A>with her, or, as some say, not liking the prospect of an imperial marriage, 
<A NAME="472"></A>though willing enough to have the emperor as her lover. So that Otho ran 
<A NAME="473"></A>the risk of his life, and strange it was he escaped, when Nero, for this 
<A NAME="474"></A>very marriage, killed his wife and sister. But he was beholden to Seneca's 
<A NAME="475"></A>friendship, by whose persuasions and entreaty Nero was prevailed with to 
<A NAME="476"></A>despatch him as praetor into Lusitania, on the shores of the Ocean; where 
<A NAME="477"></A>he behaved himself very agreeably and indulgently to those he had to govern, 
<A NAME="478"></A>well knowing this command was but to colour and disguise his 
<A NAME="479"></A>banishment.
<A NAME="480"></A><BR><BR>When Galba revolted from Nero, Otho was the first governor of any 
<A NAME="481"></A>of the provinces that came over to him, bringing all the gold and silver 
<A NAME="482"></A>he possessed in the shape of cups and tables, to be coined into money, 
<A NAME="483"></A>and also what servants he had fitly qualified to wait upon a prince. In 
<A NAME="484"></A>all other points, too, he was faithful to him, and gave him sufficient 
<A NAME="485"></A>proof that he was inferior to none in managing public business. And he 
<A NAME="486"></A>so far ingratiated himself, that he rode in the same carriage with him 
<A NAME="487"></A>during the whole journey, several days together. And in this journey and 
<A NAME="488"></A>familiar companionship he won over Vinius also, both by his conversation 
<A NAME="489"></A>and presents, but especially by conceding to him the first place securing 
<A NAME="490"></A>the second, by his interest, for himself. And he had the advantage of him 
<A NAME="491"></A>in avoiding all odium and jealousy, assisting all petitioners, without 
<A NAME="492"></A>asking for any reward, and appearing courteous and of easy access towards 
<A NAME="493"></A>all especially to the military men, for many of whom he obtained commands, 
<A NAME="494"></A>some immediately from the emperor, others by Vinius's means, and by the 
<A NAME="495"></A>assistance of the two favourite freedmen, Icelus and Asiaticus, these being 
<A NAME="496"></A>the men in chief power in the court. As often as he entertained Galba, 
<A NAME="497"></A>he gave the cohort on duty, in addition to their pay, a piece of gold for 
<A NAME="498"></A>every man there, upon pretence of respect to the emperor, while really 
<A NAME="499"></A>he undermined him, and stole away his popularity with the 
<A NAME="500"></A>soldiers.
<A NAME="501"></A><BR><BR>So Galba consulting about a successor, Vinius introduced Otho, 
<A NAME="502"></A>yet not even this gratis, but upon promise that he would marry his daughter 
<A NAME="503"></A>if Galba should make him his adopted son and successor to the empire. But 
<A NAME="504"></A>Galba, in all his actions, showed clearly that he preferred the public 
<A NAME="505"></A>good before his own private interest, not aiming so much to pleasure himself 
<A NAME="506"></A>as to advantage the Romans by his selection. Indeed he does not seem to 
<A NAME="507"></A>have been so much as inclined to make choice of Otho had it been but to 
<A NAME="508"></A>inherit his own private fortune, knowing his extravagant and luxurious 
<A NAME="509"></A>character, and that he was already plunged in debt five thousand myriads 
<A NAME="510"></A>deep. So he listened to Vinius, and made no reply, but mildly suspended 
<A NAME="511"></A>his determination. Only he appointed himself consul, and Vinius his colleague, 
<A NAME="512"></A>and it was the general expectation that he would declare his successor 
<A NAME="513"></A>at the beginning of the new year. And the soldiers desired nothing more 
<A NAME="514"></A>than that Otho should be the person.
<A NAME="515"></A><BR><BR>But the forces in Germany broke out into their mutiny whilst he 
<A NAME="516"></A>was yet deliberating, and anticipated his design. All the soldiers in general 
<A NAME="517"></A>felt much resentment against Galba for not having given them their expected 
<A NAME="518"></A>largess, but these troops made a pretence of a more particular concern, 
<A NAME="519"></A>that Virginius Rufus was cast off dishonourably, and that the bad who had 
<A NAME="520"></A>fought with them were well rewarded, while those who had refused to take 
<A NAME="521"></A>part with Vindex were punished; and Galba's thanks seemed all to be for 
<A NAME="522"></A>him, to whose memory he had done honour after his death with public solemnities 
<A NAME="523"></A>as though he had been made emperor by his means only. Whilst these discourses 
<A NAME="524"></A>passed openly throughout the army, on the first day of the first month 
<A NAME="525"></A>of the year, the Calends, as they call it, of January, Flaccus summoning 
<A NAME="526"></A>them to take the usual anniversary oath of fealty to the emperor, they 
<A NAME="527"></A>overturned and pulled down Galba's statues, and having sworn in the name 
<A NAME="528"></A>of the senate and people of Rome, departed. But the officers now feared 
<A NAME="529"></A>anarchy and confusion, as much as rebellion; and one of them came forward 
<A NAME="530"></A>and said: "What will become of us, my fellow-soldiers, if we neither set 
<A NAME="531"></A>up another general, nor retain the present one? This will be not so much 
<A NAME="532"></A>to desert from Galba as to decline all subjection and command. It is useless 
<A NAME="533"></A>to try and maintain Flaccus Hordeonius, who is but a mere shadow and image 
<A NAME="534"></A>of Galba. But Vitellius, commander of the other Germany, is but one day's 
<A NAME="535"></A>march distant, whose father was censor and thrice consul, and in a manner 
<A NAME="536"></A>co-emperor with Claudius Caesar; and he himself has the best proof to show 
<A NAME="537"></A>of his bounty and largeness of mind, in the poverty with which some reproach 
<A NAME="538"></A>him. Him let us make choice of, that all may see we know how to choose 
<A NAME="539"></A>an emperor better than either Spaniards or Lusitanians." Which motion whilst 
<A NAME="540"></A>some assented to, and others gainsaid, a certain standard-bearer slipped 
<A NAME="541"></A>out and carried the news to Vitellius, who was entertaining much company 
<A NAME="542"></A>by night. This taking air, soon passed through the troops, and Fabius Valens, 
<A NAME="543"></A>who commanded one legion, riding up next day with a large body of horse, 
<A NAME="544"></A>saluted Vitellius emperor. He had hitherto seemed to decline it, professing 
<A NAME="545"></A>a dread he had to undertake the weight of the government; but on this day, 
<A NAME="546"></A>being fortified, they say, by wine and a plentiful noon-day repast, he 
<A NAME="547"></A>began to yield, and submitted to take on him the title of Germanicus they 
<A NAME="548"></A>gave him, but desired to be excused as to that of Caesar. And immediately 
<A NAME="549"></A>the army under Flaccus also, putting away their fine and popular oaths 
<A NAME="550"></A>in the name of the senate, swore obedience to Vitellius as emperor, to 
<A NAME="551"></A>observe whatever he commanded.
<A NAME="552"></A><BR><BR>Thus Vitellius was publicly proclaimed emperor in Germany; which 
<A NAME="553"></A>news coming to Galba's ear, he no longer deferred his adoption; yet knowing 
<A NAME="554"></A>that some of his friends were using their interest for Dolabella, and the 
<A NAME="555"></A>greatest number of them for Otho, neither of whom he approved of, on a 
<A NAME="556"></A>sudden, without any one's privity, he sent for Piso, the son of Crassus 
<A NAME="557"></A>and Scribonia, whom Nero slew, a young man in general of excellent disposition 
<A NAME="558"></A>for virtue, but his most eminent qualities those of steadiness and austere 
<A NAME="559"></A>gravity. And so he set out to go to the camp to declare him Caesar and 
<A NAME="560"></A>successor to the empire. But at his very first going forth many signs appeared 
<A NAME="561"></A>in the heavens, and when he began to make a speech to the soldiers, partly 
<A NAME="562"></A>extempore, and partly reading it, the frequent claps of thunder and flashes 
<A NAME="563"></A>of lightning, and the violent storm of rain that burst on both the camp 
<A NAME="564"></A>and the city, were plain discoveries that the divine powers did not look 
<A NAME="565"></A>with favour or satisfaction on this act of adoption that would come to 
<A NAME="566"></A>no good result. The soldiers, also, showed symptoms of hidden discontent, 
<A NAME="567"></A>and wore sullen looks, no distribution of money being even now made to 
<A NAME="568"></A>them. However, those that were present and observed Piso's countenance 
<A NAME="569"></A>and voice could not but feel admiration to see him so little overcome by 
<A NAME="570"></A>so great a favour, of the magnitude of which at the same time he seemed 
<A NAME="571"></A>not at all insensible. Otho's aspect, on the other hand, did not fail to 
<A NAME="572"></A>let many marks appear of his bitterness and anger at his disappointment; 
<A NAME="573"></A>since to have been the first man thought of for it, and to have come to 
<A NAME="574"></A>the very point of being chosen, and now to be put by, was in his feelings 
<A NAME="575"></A>a sign of the displeasure and ill-will of Galba towards him. This filled 
<A NAME="576"></A>him with fears and apprehensions, and sent him home with a mind full of 
<A NAME="577"></A>various passions, whilst he dreaded Piso, hated Galba, and was full of 
<A NAME="578"></A>wrath and indignation against Vinius. And the Chaldeans and soothsayers 
<A NAME="579"></A>about him would not permit him to lay aside his hopes or quit his design, 
<A NAME="580"></A>chiefly Ptolemaeus, insisting much on a prediction he had made, that Nero 
<A NAME="581"></A>should not murder Otho, but he himself should die first, and Otho succeed 
<A NAME="582"></A>as emperor; for the first proving true, he thought he could not distrust 
<A NAME="583"></A>the rest. But none perhaps stimulated him more than those that professed 
<A NAME="584"></A>privately to pity his hard fate and compassionate him for being thus ungratefully 
<A NAME="585"></A>dealt with by Galba; especially Nymphidius's and Tigellinus's creatures, 
<A NAME="586"></A>who, being now cast off and reduced to low estate, were eager to put themselves 
<A NAME="587"></A>upon him, exclaiming at the indignity he had suffered, and provoking him 
<A NAME="588"></A>to revenge himself.
<A NAME="589"></A><BR><BR>Amongst these were Viturius and Barbius, the one an optio, the 
<A NAME="590"></A>other a tesserarius (these are men who have the duties of messengers and 
<A NAME="591"></A>scouts), with whom Onomastus, one of Otho's freedmen, went to the camp, 
<A NAME="592"></A>to tamper with the army, and brought over some with money, others with 
<A NAME="593"></A>fair promises, which was no hard matter, they being already corrupted, 
<A NAME="594"></A>and only wanting a fair pretence. It had been otherwise more than the work 
<A NAME="595"></A>of four days (which elapsed between the adoption and murder), so completely 
<A NAME="596"></A>to infect them as to cause a general revolt. On the sixth day ensuing, 
<A NAME="597"></A>the eighteenth, as the Romans call it, before the Calends of February, 
<A NAME="598"></A>the murder was done. On that day, in the morning, Galba sacrificed in the 
<A NAME="599"></A>Palatium in the presence of his friends, when Umbricius, the priest, taking 
<A NAME="600"></A>up the entrails, and speaking not ambiguously, but in plain words, said 
<A NAME="601"></A>that there were signs of great troubles ensuing, and dangerous snares laid 
<A NAME="602"></A>for the life of the emperor. Thus Otho had even been discovered by the 
<A NAME="603"></A>finger of the god; being there just behind Galba, bearing all that was 
<A NAME="604"></A>said, and seeing what was pointed out to them by Umbricius. His countenance 
<A NAME="605"></A>changed to every colour in his fear, and he was betraying no small discomposure, 
<A NAME="606"></A>when Onomastus, his freedman, came up and acquainted him that the master 
<A NAME="607"></A>builders had come, and were waiting for him at home. Now that was the signal 
<A NAME="608"></A>for Otho to meet the soldiers. Pretending then that he had purchased an 
<A NAME="609"></A>old house, and was going to show the defects to those that had sold it 
<A NAME="610"></A>to him, he departed; and passing through what is called Tiberius's house, 
<A NAME="611"></A>he went on into the forum, near the spot where a golden pillar stands, 
<A NAME="612"></A>at which all the several roads through Italy terminate.
<A NAME="613"></A><BR><BR>Here, it is related, no more than twenty-three received and saluted 
<A NAME="614"></A>him emperor; so that, although he was not in mind as in body enervated 
<A NAME="615"></A>with soft living and effeminacy, being in his nature bold and fearless 
<A NAME="616"></A>enough in danger, nevertheless, he was afraid to go on. But the soldiers 
<A NAME="617"></A>that were present would not suffer him to recede, but came with their swords 
<A NAME="618"></A>drawn around his chair, commanding the bearers to take him up, whom he 
<A NAME="619"></A>hastened on, saying several times over to himself, "I am a lost man." Several 
<A NAME="620"></A>persons overheard the words, who stood by wondering, rather than alarmed, 
<A NAME="621"></A>because of the small number that attempted such an enterprise. But as they 
<A NAME="622"></A>marched on through the forum, about as many more met him, and here and 
<A NAME="623"></A>there three or four at a time joined in. Thus returning towards the camp, 
<A NAME="624"></A>with their bare swords in their hands, they saluted him as Caesar; whereupon 
<A NAME="625"></A>Martialis, the tribune in charge of the watch, who was, they say, noways 
<A NAME="626"></A>privy to it, but was simply surprised at the unexpectedness of the thing, 
<A NAME="627"></A>and afraid to refuse, permitted him entrance. And after this, no man made 
<A NAME="628"></A>any resistance; for they that knew nothing of the design, being purposely 
<A NAME="629"></A>encompassed by the conspirators, as they were straggling here and there, 
<A NAME="630"></A>first submitted for fear, and afterwards were persuaded into compliance. 
<A NAME="631"></A>Tidings came immediately to Galba in the Palatium, whilst the priests were 
<A NAME="632"></A>still present and the sacrifices at hand, so that persons who were most 
<A NAME="633"></A>entirely incredulous about such things, and most positive in their neglect 
<A NAME="634"></A>of them, were astonished, and began to marvel at the divine event. A multitude 
<A NAME="635"></A>of all sorts of people now began to run together out of the forum; Vinius 
<A NAME="636"></A>and Laco and some of Galba's freedmen drew their swords and placed themselves 
<A NAME="637"></A>beside him; Piso went forth and addressed himself to the guards on duty 
<A NAME="638"></A>in the court; and Marius Celsus, a brave man, was despatched to the Illyrian 
<A NAME="639"></A>legion, stationed in what is called the Vipsanian chamber, to secure 
<A NAME="640"></A>them.
<A NAME="641"></A><BR><BR>Galba now consulting whether he should go out, Vinius dissuaded 
<A NAME="642"></A>him, but Celsus and Laco encouraged him by all means to do so, and sharply 
<A NAME="643"></A>reprimanded Vinius. But on a sudden a rumour came hot that Otho was slain 
<A NAME="644"></A>in the camp; and presently appeared one Julius Atticus, a man of some distinction 
<A NAME="645"></A>in the guards, running up with his drawn sword, crying out that he had 
<A NAME="646"></A>slain Caesar's enemy; and pressing through the crowd that stood in his 
<A NAME="647"></A>way, he presented himself before Galba with his bloody weapon, who, looking 
<A NAME="648"></A>on him, demanded, "Who gave you your orders?" And on his answering that 
<A NAME="649"></A>it had been his duty and the obligation of the oath he had taken the people 
<A NAME="650"></A>applauded, giving loud acclamations, and Galba got into his chair and was 
<A NAME="651"></A>carried out to sacrifice to Jupiter, and so to show himself publicly. But 
<A NAME="652"></A>coming into the forum, there met him there, like a turn of wind, the opposite 
<A NAME="653"></A>story, that Otho had made himself master of the camp. And as usual in a 
<A NAME="654"></A>crowd of such a size, some called to him to return back, others to move 
<A NAME="655"></A>forwards; some encouraged him to be bold and fear nothing, others bade 
<A NAME="656"></A>him to be cautious and distrust. And thus whilst his chair was tossed to 
<A NAME="657"></A>and fro, as it were on the waves, often tottering, there appeared first 
<A NAME="658"></A>horse, and straightway heavy-armed foot coming through Paulus's court, 
<A NAME="659"></A>and all with one accord crying out, "Down with this private man." Upon 
<A NAME="660"></A>this, the crowd of people set off running, not to fly and disperse, but 
<A NAME="661"></A>to possess themselves of the colonnades and elevated places of the forum, 
<A NAME="662"></A>as it might be to get places to see a spectacle. And as soon as Atillius 
<A NAME="663"></A>Vergilio knocked down one of Galba's statues, this was taken as the declaration 
<A NAME="664"></A>of war, and they sent a discharge of darts upon Galba's litter, and missing 
<A NAME="665"></A>their aim, came up and attacked him nearer hand with their naked swords. 
<A NAME="666"></A>No man resisted or offered to stand up in his defence, save one only, a 
<A NAME="667"></A>centurion, Sempronius Densus, the single man among so many thousands that 
<A NAME="668"></A>the sun beheld that day act worthily of the Roman empire, who, though he 
<A NAME="669"></A>had never received any favour from Galba, yet out of bravery and allegiance 
<A NAME="670"></A>endeavoured to defend the litter. First, lifting up his switch of vine, 
<A NAME="671"></A>with which the centurions correct the soldiers when disorderly, he called 
<A NAME="672"></A>aloud to the aggressors, charging them not to touch their emperor. And 
<A NAME="673"></A>when they came upon him hand-to-hand, he drew his sword, and made a defence 
<A NAME="674"></A>for a long time, until at last he was cut under the knees and brought to 
<A NAME="675"></A>the ground.
<A NAME="676"></A><BR><BR>Galba's chair was upset at the spot called the Lacus Curtius, where 
<A NAME="677"></A>they ran up and struck at him as he lay in his corselet. He, however, offered 
<A NAME="678"></A>his throat, bidding them "Strike, if it be for the Romans' good." He received 
<A NAME="679"></A>several wounds on his legs and arms, and at last was struck in the throat, 
<A NAME="680"></A>as most say, by one Camurius, a soldier of the fifteenth legion. Some name 
<A NAME="681"></A>Terentius, others Lecanius; and there are others that say it was Fabius 
<A NAME="682"></A>Fabulus, who it is reported cut off the head and carried it away in the 
<A NAME="683"></A>skirt of his coat, the baldness making it a difficult thing to take hold 
<A NAME="684"></A>of. But those that were with him would not allow him to keep it covered 
<A NAME="685"></A>up, but bade him let every one see the brave deed he had done; so that 
<A NAME="686"></A>after a while he stuck upon the lance the head of the aged man that had 
<A NAME="687"></A>been their grave and temperate ruler, their supreme priest and consul, 
<A NAME="688"></A>and, tossing it up in the air, ran like a bacchanal, twirling and flourishing 
<A NAME="689"></A>with it, while the blood ran down the spear. But when they brought the 
<A NAME="690"></A>head to Otho, "Fellow-soldiers," he cried out, "this is nothing, unless 
<A NAME="691"></A>you show me Piso's too," which was presented him not long after. The young 
<A NAME="692"></A>man, retreating upon a wound received, was pursued by one Murcus, and slain 
<A NAME="693"></A>at the temple of Vesta. Titus Vinius was also despatched, avowing himself 
<A NAME="694"></A>to have been privy to the conspiracy against Galba by calling out that 
<A NAME="695"></A>they were killing him contrary to Otho's pleasure. However, they cut off 
<A NAME="696"></A>his head, and Laco's too, and brought them to Otho, requesting a 
<A NAME="697"></A>boon.
<A NAME="698"></A><BR><BR>And as Archilochus says-
<A NAME="699"></A><BR><BR>"When six or seven lie breathless on the ground,
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>'Twas I, 'twas I, say thousands, gave the wound." Thus many that had 
<A NAME="701"></A>no share in the murder wetted their hands and swords in blood, and came 
<A NAME="702"></A>and showed them to Otho, presenting memorials suing for a gratuity. Not 
<A NAME="703"></A>less than one hundred and twenty were identified afterwards from their 
<A NAME="704"></A>written petitions; all of whom Vitellius sought out and put to death. There 
<A NAME="705"></A>came also into the camp Marius Celsus, and was accused by many voices of 
<A NAME="706"></A>encouraging the soldiers to assist Galba, and was demanded to death by 
<A NAME="707"></A>the multitude. Otho had no desire for this, yet, fearing an absolute denial, 
<A NAME="708"></A>he professed that he did not wish to take him off so soon, having many 
<A NAME="709"></A>matters yet to learn from him; and so committed him safe to the custody 
<A NAME="710"></A>of those he most confided in.
<A NAME="711"></A><BR><BR>Forthwith a senate was convened, and as if they were not the same 
<A NAME="712"></A>men, or had other gods to swear by, they took that oath in Otho's name 
<A NAME="713"></A>which he himself had taken in Galba's and had broken; and withal conferred 
<A NAME="714"></A>on him the titles of Caesar and Augustus; whilst the dead carcasses of 
<A NAME="715"></A>the slain lay yet in their consular robes in the market-place. As for their 
<A NAME="716"></A>heads, when they could make no other use of them, Vinius's they sold to 
<A NAME="717"></A>his daughter for two thousand five hundred drachmas; Piso's was begged 
<A NAME="718"></A>by his wife, Verania; Galba's they gave to Patrobius's servants; who when 
<A NAME="719"></A>they had it, after all sorts of abuse and indignities, tumbled it into 
<A NAME="720"></A>the place where those that suffer death by the emperor's orders are usually 
<A NAME="721"></A>cast, called Sessorium. Galba's body was conveyed away by Priscus Helvidius 
<A NAME="722"></A>by Otho's permission, and buried in the night by Argius, his 
<A NAME="723"></A>freedman.
<A NAME="724"></A><BR><BR>Thus you have the history of Galba, a person inferior to few Romans, 
<A NAME="725"></A>either for birth or riches, rather exceeding all of his time in both, having 
<A NAME="726"></A>lived in great honour and reputation in the reigns of five emperors, insomuch 
<A NAME="727"></A>that he overthrew Nero rather by his fame and repute in the world than 
<A NAME="728"></A>by actual force and power. Of all the others that joined in Nero's deposition, 
<A NAME="729"></A>some were by general consent regarded as unworthy, others had only themselves 
<A NAME="730"></A>to vote them deserving of the empire. To him the title was offered, and 
<A NAME="731"></A>by him it was accepted; and simply lending his name to Vindex's attempt, 
<A NAME="732"></A>he gave to what had been called rebellion before, the name of a civil war, 
<A NAME="733"></A>by the presence of one that was accounted fit to govern. And therefore, 
<A NAME="734"></A>as he considered that he had not so much sought the position as the position 
<A NAME="735"></A>had sought him, he proposed to command those whom Nymphidius and Tigellinus 
<A NAME="736"></A>had wheedled into obedience no otherwise than Scipio formerly and Fabricius 
<A NAME="737"></A>and Camillus had commanded the Romans of their times. But being now overcome 
<A NAME="738"></A>with age, he was indeed among the troops and legions an upright ruler upon 
<A NAME="739"></A>the antique model; but for the rest, giving himself up to Vinius, Laco, 
<A NAME="740"></A>and his freedmen, who make their gain of all things, no otherwise than 
<A NAME="741"></A>Nero had done to his insatiate favourites, he left none behind him to wish 
<A NAME="742"></A>him still in power, though many to compassionate his 
<A NAME="743"></A>death.
