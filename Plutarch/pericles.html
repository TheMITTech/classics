<BR>(legendary, died 429 B.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>CAESAR once, seeing some wealthy strangers at Rome, carrying up and down 
<A NAME="11"></A>with them in their arms and bosoms young puppy-dogs and monkeys, embracing 
<A NAME="12"></A>and making much of them, took occasion not unnaturally to ask whether the 
<A NAME="13"></A>women in their country were not used to bear children; by that prince-like 
<A NAME="14"></A>reprimand gravely reflecting upon persons who spend and lavish upon brute 
<A NAME="15"></A>beasts that affection and kindness which nature has implanted in us to 
<A NAME="16"></A>be bestowed on those of our own kind. With like reason may we blame those 
<A NAME="17"></A>who misuse that love of inquiry and observation which nature has implanted 
<A NAME="18"></A>in our souls, by expending it on objects unworthy of the attention either 
<A NAME="19"></A>of their eyes or their ears, while they disregard such as are excellent 
<A NAME="20"></A>in themselves, and would do them good.
<A NAME="21"></A><BR><BR>The mere outward sense, being passive in responding to the impression 
<A NAME="22"></A>of the objects that come in its way and strike upon it, perhaps cannot 
<A NAME="23"></A>help entertaining and taking notice of everything that addresses it, be 
<A NAME="24"></A>it what it will, useful or unuseful; but, in the exercise of his mental 
<A NAME="25"></A>perception, every man, if he chooses, has a natural power to turn himself 
<A NAME="26"></A>upon all occasions, and to change and shift with the greatest ease to what 
<A NAME="27"></A>he shall himself judge desirable. So that it becomes a man's duty to pursue 
<A NAME="28"></A>and make after the best and choicest of everything, that he may not only 
<A NAME="29"></A>employ his contemplation, but may also be improved by it. For as that colour 
<A NAME="30"></A>is more suitable to the eye whose freshness and pleasantness stimulates 
<A NAME="31"></A>and strengthens the sight, so a man ought to apply his intellectual perception 
<A NAME="32"></A>to such objects as, with the sense of delight, are apt to call it forth, 
<A NAME="33"></A>and allure it to its own proper good and advantage.
<A NAME="34"></A><BR><BR>Such objects we find in the acts of virtue, which also produce 
<A NAME="35"></A>in the minds of mere readers about them an emulation and eagerness that 
<A NAME="36"></A>may lead them on to imitation. In other things there does not immediately 
<A NAME="37"></A>follow upon the admiration and liking of the thing done any strong desire 
<A NAME="38"></A>of doing the like. Nay, many times, on the very contrary, when we are pleased 
<A NAME="39"></A>with the work, we slight and set little by the workman or artist himself, 
<A NAME="40"></A>as for instance, in perfumes and purple dyes, we are taken with the things 
<A NAME="41"></A>themselves well enough, but do not think dyers and perfumers otherwise 
<A NAME="42"></A>than low and sordid people. It was not said amiss by Antisthenes, when 
<A NAME="43"></A>people told him that one Ismenias was an excellent piper. "It may be so," 
<A NAME="44"></A>said he, "but he is but a wretched human being, otherwise he would not 
<A NAME="45"></A>have been an excellent piper." And King Philip, to the same purpose, told 
<A NAME="46"></A>his son Alexander, who once at a merry-meeting played a piece of music 
<A NAME="47"></A>charmingly and skilfully, "Are you not ashamed, son, to play so well?" 
<A NAME="48"></A>For it is enough for a king or prince to find leisure sometimes to hear 
<A NAME="49"></A>others sing, and he does the muses quite honour enough when he pleases 
<A NAME="50"></A>to be but present, while others engage in such exercises and trials of 
<A NAME="51"></A>skill.
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR>He who busies himself in mean occupations produces, in the very 
<A NAME="53"></A>pains he takes about things of little or no use, an evidence against himself 
<A NAME="54"></A>of his negligence and indisposition to what is really good. Nor did any 
<A NAME="55"></A>generous and ingenuous young man, at the sight of the statue of Jupiter 
<A NAME="56"></A>at Pisa, ever desire to be a Phidias, or on seeing that of Juno at Argos, 
<A NAME="57"></A>long to be a Polycletus, or feel induced by his pleasure in their poems 
<A NAME="58"></A>to wish to be an Anacreon or Philetas or Archilochus. For it does not necessarily 
<A NAME="59"></A>follow, that, if a piece of work please for its gracefulness, therefore 
<A NAME="60"></A>he that wrought it deserves our admiration. Whence it is that neither do 
<A NAME="61"></A>such things really profit or advantage the beholders, upon the sight of 
<A NAME="62"></A>which no zeal arises for the imitation of them, nor any impulse or inclination, 
<A NAME="63"></A>which may prompt any desire or endeavour of doing the like. But virtue, 
<A NAME="64"></A>by the bare statement of its actions, can so affect men's minds as to create 
<A NAME="65"></A>at once both admiration of the things done and desire to imitate the doers 
<A NAME="66"></A>of them. The goods of fortune we would possess and would enjoy; those of 
<A NAME="67"></A>virtue we long to practise and exercise: we are content to receive the 
<A NAME="68"></A>former from others, the latter we wish others to experience from us. Moral 
<A NAME="69"></A>good is a practical stimulus; it is no sooner seen, than it inspires an 
<A NAME="70"></A>impulse to practice, and influences the mind and character not by a mere 
<A NAME="71"></A>imitation which we look at, but by the statement of the fact creates a 
<A NAME="72"></A>moral purpose which we form.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>And so we have thought fit to spend our time and pains in writing 
<A NAME="74"></A>of the lives of famous persons; and have composed this tenth book upon 
<A NAME="75"></A>that subject, containing the life of Pericles, and that of Fabius Maximus, 
<A NAME="76"></A>who carried on the war against Hannibal, men alike, as in their other virtues 
<A NAME="77"></A>and good parts, so especially in their mind and upright temper and demeanour, 
<A NAME="78"></A>and in that capacity to bear the cross-grained humours of their fellow-citizens 
<A NAME="79"></A>and colleagues in office, which made them both most useful and serviceable 
<A NAME="80"></A>to the interests of their countries. Whether we take a right aim at our 
<A NAME="81"></A>intended purpose, it is left to the reader to judge by what he shall here 
<A NAME="82"></A>find.
<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR>Pericles was of the tribe Acamantis, and the township Cholargus, 
<A NAME="84"></A>of the noblest birth both on his father's and mother's side. Xanthippus, 
<A NAME="85"></A>his father, who defeated the King of Persia's generals in the battle of 
<A NAME="86"></A>Mycale, took to wife Agariste, the grandchild of Clisthenes, who drove 
<A NAME="87"></A>out the sons of Pisistratus, and nobly put an end to their tyrannical usurpation, 
<A NAME="88"></A>and, moreover, made a body of laws, and settled a model of government admirably 
<A NAME="89"></A>tempered and suited for the harmony and safety of the 
<A NAME="90"></A>people.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR>His mother, being near her time, fancied in a dream that she was 
<A NAME="92"></A>brought to bed of a lion, and a few days after was delivered of Pericles, 
<A NAME="93"></A>in other respects perfectly formed, only his head was somewhat longish 
<A NAME="94"></A>and out of proportion. For which reason almost all the images and statues 
<A NAME="95"></A>that were made of him have the head covered with a helmet, the workmen 
<A NAME="96"></A>apparently being willing not to expose him. The poets of Athens called 
<A NAME="97"></A>him Schinocephalos, or squill-head, from schinos, a squill, or sea-onion. 
<A NAME="98"></A>One of the comic poets, Cratinus, in the Chirons, tells us 
<A NAME="99"></A>that-
<A NAME="100"></A><BR><BR>"Old Chronos once took queen Sedition to wife:
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>Which two brought to life
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>That tyrant far-famed,
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>Whom the gods the supreme skull-compeller have named; and, in the Nemesis, 
<A NAME="104"></A>addresses him-
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR>"Come, Jove, thou head of Gods." And a second, Teleclides, says, 
<A NAME="106"></A>that now, in embarrassment with political difficulties, he sits in the 
<A NAME="107"></A>city-
<A NAME="108"></A><BR><BR>"Fainting underneath the load
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>Of his own head: and now abroad
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>From his huge gallery of a pate
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>Sends forth trouble to the state." And a third, Eupolis, in the comedy 
<A NAME="112"></A>called the Demi, in a series of questions about each of the demagogues, 
<A NAME="113"></A>whom he makes in the play to come up from hell, upon Pericles being named 
<A NAME="114"></A>last, exclaims-
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR>"And here by way of summary, now we've done,
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>Behold, in brief, the heads of all in one."
<A NAME="117"></A><BR><BR>The master that taught him music, most authors are agreed, was 
<A NAME="118"></A>Damon (whose name, they say, ought to be pronounced with the first syllable 
<A NAME="119"></A>short). Though Aristotle tells us that he was thoroughly practised in all 
<A NAME="120"></A>accomplishments of this kind by Pythoclides. Damon, it is not unlikely, 
<A NAME="121"></A>being a sophist, out of policy sheltered himself under the profession of 
<A NAME="122"></A>music to conceal from people in general his skill in other things, and 
<A NAME="123"></A>under this pretence attended Pericles, the young athlete of politics, so 
<A NAME="124"></A>to say, as his training-master in these exercises. Damon's lyre, however, 
<A NAME="125"></A>did not prove altogether a successful blind; he was banished the country 
<A NAME="126"></A>by ostracism for ten years, as a dangerous intermeddler and a favourer 
<A NAME="127"></A>of arbitrary power, and, by this means, gave the stage occasion to play 
<A NAME="128"></A>upon him. As, for instance, Plato, the comic poet, introduces a character 
<A NAME="129"></A>who questions him-
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR>"Tell me, if you please,
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>Since you're the Chiron who taught Pericles."
<A NAME="132"></A><BR><BR>Pericles, also, was a hearer of Zeno, the Eleatic, who treated 
<A NAME="133"></A>of natural philosophy in the same manner as Parmenides did, but had also 
<A NAME="134"></A>perfected himself in an art of his own for refuting and silencing opponents 
<A NAME="135"></A>in argument; as Timon of Phlius describes it-
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>"Also the two-edged tongue of mighty Zeno, who,
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>Say what one would, could argue it untrue."
<A NAME="138"></A><BR><BR>But he that saw most of Pericles, and furnished him most especially 
<A NAME="139"></A>with a weight and grandeur of sense, superior to all arts of popularity, 
<A NAME="140"></A>and in general gave him his elevation and sublimity of purpose and of character, 
<A NAME="141"></A>was Anaxagoras of Clazomenae; whom the men of those times called by the 
<A NAME="142"></A>name of Nous, that is, mind, or intelligence, whether in admiration of 
<A NAME="143"></A>the great and extraordinary gift he had displayed for the science of nature, 
<A NAME="144"></A>or because that he was the first of the philosophers who did not refer 
<A NAME="145"></A>the first ordering of the world to fortune or chance, nor to necessity 
<A NAME="146"></A>or compulsion, but to a pure, unadulterated intelligence, which in all 
<A NAME="147"></A>other existing mixed and compound things acts as a principle of discrimination, 
<A NAME="148"></A>and of combination of like with like.
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR>For this man, Pericles entertained an extraordinary esteem and 
<A NAME="150"></A>admiration, and filling himself with this lofty and, as they call it, up-in-the-air 
<A NAME="151"></A>sort of thought, derived hence not merely, as was natural, elevation of 
<A NAME="152"></A>purpose and dignity of language, raised far above the base and dishonest 
<A NAME="153"></A>buffooneries of mob eloquence, but, besides this, a composure of countenance, 
<A NAME="154"></A>and a serenity and calmness in all his movements, which no occurrence whilst 
<A NAME="155"></A>he was speaking could disturb, a sustained and even tone of voice, and 
<A NAME="156"></A>various other advantages of a similar kind, which produced the greatest 
<A NAME="157"></A>effect on his hearers. Once, after being reviled and ill-spoken of all 
<A NAME="158"></A>day long in his own hearing by some vile and abandoned fellow in the open 
<A NAME="159"></A>market-place, where he was engaged in the despatch of some urgent affair. 
<A NAME="160"></A>He continued his business in perfect silence, and in the evening returned 
<A NAME="161"></A>home composedly, the man still dogging him at the heels, and pelting him 
<A NAME="162"></A>all the way with abuse and foul language; and stepping into his house, 
<A NAME="163"></A>it being by this time dark, he ordered one of his servants to take a light, 
<A NAME="164"></A>and to go along with the man and see him safe home. Ion, it is true, the 
<A NAME="165"></A>dramatic poet, says that Pericles's manner in company was somewhat over-assuming 
<A NAME="166"></A>and pompous; and that into his high-bearing there entered a good deal of 
<A NAME="167"></A>slightingness and scorn of others; he reserves his commendation for Cimon's 
<A NAME="168"></A>ease and pliancy and natural grace in society. Ion, however, who must needs 
<A NAME="169"></A>make virtue, like a show of tragedies, include some comic scenes, we shall 
<A NAME="170"></A>not altogether rely upon; Zeno used to bid those who called Pericles's 
<A NAME="171"></A>gravity the affectation of a charlatan, to go and affect the like themselves; 
<A NAME="172"></A>inasmuch as this mere counterfeiting might in time insensibly instil into 
<A NAME="173"></A>them a real love and knowledge of those noble qualities.
<A NAME="174"></A><BR><BR>Nor were these the only advantages which Pericles derived from 
<A NAME="175"></A>Anaxagoras's acquaintance; he seems also to have become, by his instructions, 
<A NAME="176"></A>superior to that superstition with which an ignorant wonder at appearances, 
<A NAME="177"></A>for example, in the heavens, possesses the minds of people unacquainted 
<A NAME="178"></A>with their causes, eager for the supernatural, and excitable through an 
<A NAME="179"></A>inexperience which the knowledge of natural causes removes, replacing wild 
<A NAME="180"></A>and timid superstition by the good hope and assurance of an intelligent 
<A NAME="181"></A>piety.
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>There is a story, that once Pericles had brought to him from a 
<A NAME="183"></A>country farm of his a ram's head with one horn, and that Lampon, the diviner, 
<A NAME="184"></A>upon seeing the horn grow strong and solid out of the midst of the forehead, 
<A NAME="185"></A>gave it as his judgment, that, there being at that time two potent factions, 
<A NAME="186"></A>parties, or interests in the city, the one of Thucydides and the other 
<A NAME="187"></A>of Pericles, the government would come about to that one of them in whose 
<A NAME="188"></A>ground or estate this token or indication of fate had shown itself. But 
<A NAME="189"></A>that Anaxagoras, cleaving the skull in sunder, showed to the bystanders 
<A NAME="190"></A>that the brain had not filled up its natural place, but being oblong, like 
<A NAME="191"></A>an egg, had collected from all parts of the vessel which contained it in 
<A NAME="192"></A>a point to that place from whence the root of the horn took its rise. And 
<A NAME="193"></A>that, for that time, Anaxagoras was much admired for his explanation by 
<A NAME="194"></A>those that were present; and Lampon no less a little while after, when 
<A NAME="195"></A>Thucydides was overpowered, and the whole affairs of the state and government 
<A NAME="196"></A>came into the hands of Pericles.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>And yet, in my opinion, it is no absurdity to say that they were 
<A NAME="198"></A>both in the right, both natural philosopher and diviner, one justly detecting 
<A NAME="199"></A>the cause of this event, by which it was produced, the other the end for 
<A NAME="200"></A>which it was designed. For it was the business of the one to find out and 
<A NAME="201"></A>give an account of what it was made, and in what manner and by what means 
<A NAME="202"></A>it grew as it did; and of the other to foretell to what end and purpose 
<A NAME="203"></A>it was so made, and what it might mean or portend. Those who say that to 
<A NAME="204"></A>find out the cause of a prodigy is in effect to destroy its supposed signification 
<A NAME="205"></A>as such, do not take notice, that, at the same time, together with divine 
<A NAME="206"></A>prodigies, they also do away with signs and signals of human art and concert, 
<A NAME="207"></A>as, for instance, the clashings of quoits, fire-beacons, and the shadows 
<A NAME="208"></A>of sun-dials, every one of which has its cause, and by that cause and contrivance 
<A NAME="209"></A>is a sign of something else. But these are subjects, perhaps, that would 
<A NAME="210"></A>better befit another place.
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR>Pericles, while yet but a young man, stood in considerable apprehension 
<A NAME="212"></A>of the people, as he was thought in face and figure to be very like the 
<A NAME="213"></A>tyrant Pisistratus, and those of great age remarked upon the sweetness 
<A NAME="214"></A>of his voice, and his volubility and rapidity in speaking, and were struck 
<A NAME="215"></A>with amazement at the resemblance. Reflecting, too, that he had a considerable 
<A NAME="216"></A>estate, and was descended of a noble family, and had friends of great influence, 
<A NAME="217"></A>he was fearful all this might bring him to be banished as a dangerous person, 
<A NAME="218"></A>and for this reason meddled not at all with state affairs, but in military 
<A NAME="219"></A>service showed himself of a brave and intrepid nature. But when Aristides 
<A NAME="220"></A>was now dead, and Themistocles driven out, and Cimon was for the most part 
<A NAME="221"></A>kept abroad by the expeditions he made in parts out of Greece, Pericles, 
<A NAME="222"></A>seeing things in this posture, now advanced and took his side, not with 
<A NAME="223"></A>the rich and few, but with the many and poor, contrary to his natural bent, 
<A NAME="224"></A>which was far from democratical; but, most likely fearing he might fall 
<A NAME="225"></A>under suspicion of aiming at arbitrary power, and seeing Cimon on the side 
<A NAME="226"></A>of the aristocracy, and much beloved by the better and more distinguished 
<A NAME="227"></A>people, he joined the party of the people, with a view at once both to 
<A NAME="228"></A>secure himself and procure means against Cimon.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR><BR>He immediately entered, also, on quite a new course of life and 
<A NAME="230"></A>management of his time. For he was never seen to walk in any street but 
<A NAME="231"></A>that which led to the market-place and council-hall, and he avoided invitations 
<A NAME="232"></A>of friends to supper, and all friendly visiting and intercourse whatever; 
<A NAME="233"></A>in all the time he had to do with the public, which was not a little, he 
<A NAME="234"></A>was never known to have gone to any of his friends to a supper, except 
<A NAME="235"></A>that once when his near kinsman Euryptolemus married, he remained present 
<A NAME="236"></A>till the ceremony of the drink-offering, and then immediately rose from 
<A NAME="237"></A>table and went his way. For these friendly meetings are very quick to defeat 
<A NAME="238"></A>any assumed superiority, and in intimate familiarity an exterior of gravity 
<A NAME="239"></A>is hard to maintain. Real excellence, indeed, is most recognized when most 
<A NAME="240"></A>openly looked into; and in really good men, nothing which meets the eyes 
<A NAME="241"></A>of external observers so truly deserves their admiration, as their daily 
<A NAME="242"></A>common life does that of their nearer friends. Pericles, however, to avoid 
<A NAME="243"></A>any feeling of commonness, or any satiety on the part of the people, presented 
<A NAME="244"></A>himself at intervals only, not speaking to every business, nor at all times 
<A NAME="245"></A>coming into the assembly, but, as Critolaus says, reserving himself, like 
<A NAME="246"></A>the Salaminian galley, for great occasions, while matters of lesser importance 
<A NAME="247"></A>were despatched by friends or other speakers under his direction. And of 
<A NAME="248"></A>this number we are told Ephialtes made one, who broke the power of the 
<A NAME="249"></A>council of Areopagus, giving the people, according to Plato's expression, 
<A NAME="250"></A>so copious and so strong a draught of liberty, that growing wild and unruly, 
<A NAME="251"></A>like an unmanageable horse, it, as the comic poets say"-
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR>"-got beyond all keeping in,
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>Champing at Euboea, and among the islands leaping 
<A NAME="254"></A>in."
<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR>The style of speaking most consonant to his form of life and the 
<A NAME="256"></A>dignity of his views he found, so to say, in the tones of that instrument 
<A NAME="257"></A>with which Anaxagoras had furnished him; of his teaching he continually 
<A NAME="258"></A>availed himself, and deepened the colours of rhetoric with the dye of natural 
<A NAME="259"></A>science. For having, in addition to his great natural genius, attained, 
<A NAME="260"></A>by the study of nature, to use the words of the divine Plato, this height 
<A NAME="261"></A>of intelligence, and this universal consummating power, and drawing hence 
<A NAME="262"></A>whatever might be of advantage to him in the art of speaking, he showed 
<A NAME="263"></A>himself far superior to all others. Upon which account, they say, he had 
<A NAME="264"></A>his nickname given him; though some are of opinion he was named the Olympian 
<A NAME="265"></A>from the public buildings with which he adorned the city; and others again, 
<A NAME="266"></A>from his great power in public affairs, whether of war or peace. Nor is 
<A NAME="267"></A>it unlikely that the confluence of many attributes may have conferred it 
<A NAME="268"></A>on him. However, the comedies represented at the time, which, both in good 
<A NAME="269"></A>earnest and in merriment, let fly many hard words at him, plainly show 
<A NAME="270"></A>that he got that appellation especially from his speaking; they speak of 
<A NAME="271"></A>his "thundering and lightning" when he harangued the people, and of his 
<A NAME="272"></A>wielding a dreadful thunderbolt in his tongue.
<A NAME="273"></A><BR><BR>A saying also of Thucydides, the son of Melesias, stands on record, 
<A NAME="274"></A>spoken by him by way of pleasantry upon Pericles's dexterity. Thucydides 
<A NAME="275"></A>was one of the noble and distinguished citizens, and had been his greatest 
<A NAME="276"></A>opponent; and, when Archidamus, the King of the Lacedaemonians, asked him 
<A NAME="277"></A>whether he or Pericles were the better wrestler, he made this answer: "When 
<A NAME="278"></A>I," said he, "have thrown him and given him a fair fall, by persisting 
<A NAME="279"></A>that he had no fall, he gets the better of me, and makes the bystanders, 
<A NAME="280"></A>in spite of their own eyes, believe him." The truth, however, is, that 
<A NAME="281"></A>Pericles himself was very careful what and how he was to speak, insomuch 
<A NAME="282"></A>that, whenever he went up to the hustings, he prayed the gods that no one 
<A NAME="283"></A>word might unawares slip from him unsuitable to the matter and the 
<A NAME="284"></A>occasion.
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>He has left nothing in writing behind him, except some decrees; 
<A NAME="286"></A>and there are but very few of his sayings recorded; one, for example, is, 
<A NAME="287"></A>that he said Aegina must, like a gathering in a man's eye, be removed from 
<A NAME="288"></A>Piraeus; and another, that he said he saw already war moving on its way 
<A NAME="289"></A>towards them out of Peloponnesus. Again, when on a time Sophocles, who 
<A NAME="290"></A>was his fellow-commissioner in the generalship, was going on board with 
<A NAME="291"></A>him, and praised the beauty of a youth they met with in the way to the 
<A NAME="292"></A>ship, "Sophocles," said he, "a general ought not only to have clean hands 
<A NAME="293"></A>but also clean eyes." And Stesimbrotus tells us that, in his encomium on 
<A NAME="294"></A>those who fell in battle at Samos, he said they were become immortal, as 
<A NAME="295"></A>the gods were. "For," said he, "we do not see them themselves, but only 
<A NAME="296"></A>by the honours we pay them, and by the benefits they do us, attribute to 
<A NAME="297"></A>them immortality; and the like attributes belong also to those that die 
<A NAME="298"></A>in the service of their country."
<A NAME="299"></A><BR><BR>Since Thucydides describes the rule of Pericles as an aristocratical 
<A NAME="300"></A>government, that went by the name of a democracy, but was, indeed, the 
<A NAME="301"></A>supremacy of a single great man, while many others say, on the contrary, 
<A NAME="302"></A>that by him the common people were first encouraged and led on to such 
<A NAME="303"></A>evils as appropriations of subject territory, allowances for attending 
<A NAME="304"></A>theatres, payments for performing public duties, and by these bad habits 
<A NAME="305"></A>were, under the influence of his public measures, changed from a sober, 
<A NAME="306"></A>thrifty people, that maintained themselves by their own labours, to lovers 
<A NAME="307"></A>of expense, intemperance, and licence, let us examine the cause of this 
<A NAME="308"></A>change by the actual matters of fact.
<A NAME="309"></A><BR><BR>At the first, as has been said, when he set himself against Cimon's 
<A NAME="310"></A>great authority, he did caress the people. Finding himself come short of 
<A NAME="311"></A>his competitor in wealth and money, by which advantages the other was enabled 
<A NAME="312"></A>to take care of the poor, inviting every day some one or other of the citizens 
<A NAME="313"></A>that was in want to supper, and bestowing clothes on the aged people, and 
<A NAME="314"></A>breaking down the hedges and enclosures of his grounds, that all that would 
<A NAME="315"></A>might freely gather what fruit they pleased, Pericles, thus outdone in 
<A NAME="316"></A>popular arts, by the advice of one Damonides of Oea, as Aristotle states, 
<A NAME="317"></A>turned to the distribution of the public moneys; and in a short time having 
<A NAME="318"></A>bought the people over, what with moneys allowed for shows and for service 
<A NAME="319"></A>on juries, and what with other forms of pay and largess, he made use of 
<A NAME="320"></A>them against the council of Areopagus of which he himself was no member, 
<A NAME="321"></A>as having never been appointed by lot- either chief archon, or lawgiver, 
<A NAME="322"></A>or king, or captain. For from of old these offices were conferred on persons 
<A NAME="323"></A>by lot, and they who had acquitted themselves duly in the discharge of 
<A NAME="324"></A>them were advanced to the court of Areopagus. And so Pericles, having secured 
<A NAME="325"></A>his power in interest with the populace, directed the exertions of his 
<A NAME="326"></A>party against this council with such success, that most of these causes 
<A NAME="327"></A>and matters which had been used to be tried there were, by the agency of 
<A NAME="328"></A>Ephialtes, removed from its cognisance; Cimon, also, was banished by ostracism 
<A NAME="329"></A>as a favourer of the Lacedaemonians and a hater of the people, though in 
<A NAME="330"></A>wealth and noble birth he was among the first, and had won several most 
<A NAME="331"></A>glorious victories over the barbarians, and had filled the city with money 
<A NAME="332"></A>and spoils of war; as is recorded in the history of his life. So vast an 
<A NAME="333"></A>authority had Pericles obtained among the people.
<A NAME="334"></A><BR><BR>The ostracism was limited by law to ten years; but the Lacedaemonians, 
<A NAME="335"></A>in the meantime, entering with a great army into the territory of Tanagra, 
<A NAME="336"></A>and the Athenians going out against them, Cimon, coming from his banishment 
<A NAME="337"></A>before his time was out, put himself in arms and array with those of his 
<A NAME="338"></A>fellow-citizens that were of his own tribe, and desired by his deeds to 
<A NAME="339"></A>wipe off the suspicion of his favouring the Lacedaemonians, by venturing 
<A NAME="340"></A>his own person along with his countrymen. But Pericles's friends, gathering 
<A NAME="341"></A>in a body, forced him to retire as a banished man. For which cause also 
<A NAME="342"></A>Pericles seems to have exerted himself more in that than in any battle, 
<A NAME="343"></A>and to have been conspicuous above all for his exposure of himself to danger. 
<A NAME="344"></A>All Cimon's friends, also, to a man, fell together side by side, whom Pericles 
<A NAME="345"></A>had accused with him of taking part with the Lacedaemonians. Defeated in 
<A NAME="346"></A>this battle on their own frontiers, and expecting a new and perilous attack 
<A NAME="347"></A>with return of spring, the Athenians now felt regret and sorrow for the 
<A NAME="348"></A>loss of Cimon, and repentance for their expulsion of him. Pericles, being 
<A NAME="349"></A>sensible of their feelings, did not hesitate or delay to gratify it, and 
<A NAME="350"></A>himself made the motion for recalling him home. He, upon his return, concluded 
<A NAME="351"></A>a peace betwixt the two cities; for the Lacedaemonians entertained as kindly 
<A NAME="352"></A>feelings towards him as they did the reverse towards Pericles and the other 
<A NAME="353"></A>popular leaders.
<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR>Yet some there are who say that Pericles did not propose the order 
<A NAME="355"></A>for Cimon's return till some private articles of agreement had been made 
<A NAME="356"></A>between them, and this by means of Elpinice, Cimon's sister; that Cimon, 
<A NAME="357"></A>namely, should go out to sea with a fleet of two hundred ships, and be 
<A NAME="358"></A>commander-in-chief abroad, with a design to reduce the King of Persia's 
<A NAME="359"></A>territories, and that Pericles should have the power at 
<A NAME="360"></A>home.
<A NAME="361"></A><BR><BR>This Elpinice, it was thought, had before this time procured some 
<A NAME="362"></A>favour for her brother Cimon at Pericles's hands, and induced him to be 
<A NAME="363"></A>more remiss and gentle in urging the charge when Cimon was tried for his 
<A NAME="364"></A>life; for Pericles was one of the committee appointed by the commons to 
<A NAME="365"></A>plead against him. And when Elpinice came and besought him in her brother's 
<A NAME="366"></A>behalf, he answered, with a smile, "O Elpinice, you are too old a woman 
<A NAME="367"></A>to undertake such business as this." But, when he appeared to impeach him, 
<A NAME="368"></A>he stood up but once to speak, merely to acquit himself of his commission, 
<A NAME="369"></A>and went out of court, having done Cimon the least prejudice of any of 
<A NAME="370"></A>his accusers.
<A NAME="371"></A><BR><BR>How, then, can one believe Idomeneus, who charges Pericles as if 
<A NAME="372"></A>he had by treachery procured the murder of Ephialtes, the popular statesman, 
<A NAME="373"></A>one who was his friend, and of his own party in all his political course, 
<A NAME="374"></A>out of jealousy, forsooth, and envy of his great reputation? This historian, 
<A NAME="375"></A>it seems, having raked up these stories, I know not whence, has befouled 
<A NAME="376"></A>with them a man who, perchance, was not altogether free from fault or blame, 
<A NAME="377"></A>but yet had a noble spirit, and a soul that was bent on honour; and where 
<A NAME="378"></A>such qualities are, there can no such cruel and brutal passion find harbour 
<A NAME="379"></A>or gain admittance. As to Ephialtes, the truth of the story, as Aristotle 
<A NAME="380"></A>has told it, is this: that having made himself formidable to the oligarchical 
<A NAME="381"></A>party, by being an uncompromising asserter of the people's rights in calling 
<A NAME="382"></A>to account and prosecuting those who any way wronged them, his enemies, 
<A NAME="383"></A>lying in wait for him, by the means of Aristodicus the Tanagraean, privately 
<A NAME="384"></A>despatched him.
<A NAME="385"></A><BR><BR>Cimon, while he was admiral, ended his days in the Isle of Cyprus. 
<A NAME="386"></A>And the aristocratical party, seeing that Pericles was already before this 
<A NAME="387"></A>grown to be the greatest and foremost man of all the city, but nevertheless 
<A NAME="388"></A>wishing there should be somebody set up against him, to blunt and turn 
<A NAME="389"></A>the edge of his power, that it might not altogether prove a monarchy, put 
<A NAME="390"></A>forward Thucydides of Alopece, a discreet person, and a near kinsman of 
<A NAME="391"></A>Cimon's, to conduct the opposition against him; who, indeed, though less 
<A NAME="392"></A>skilled in warlike affairs than Cimon was, yet was better versed in speaking 
<A NAME="393"></A>and political business and keeping close guard in the city, and, engaging 
<A NAME="394"></A>with Pericles on the hustings, in a short time brought the government to 
<A NAME="395"></A>an equality of parties. For he would not suffer those who were called the 
<A NAME="396"></A>honest and good (persons of worth and distinction) to be scattered up and 
<A NAME="397"></A>down and mix themselves and be lost among the populace, as formerly, diminishing 
<A NAME="398"></A>and obscuring their superiority amongst the masses; but taking them apart 
<A NAME="399"></A>by themselves and uniting them in one body, by their combined weight he 
<A NAME="400"></A>was able, as it were upon the balance, to make a counterpoise to the other 
<A NAME="401"></A>party.
<A NAME="402"></A><BR><BR>For, indeed, there was from the beginning a sort of concealed split, 
<A NAME="403"></A>or seam, as it might be in a piece of iron, marking the different popular 
<A NAME="404"></A>and aristocratical tendencies; but the open rivalry and contention of these 
<A NAME="405"></A>two opponents made the gash deep, and severed the city into the two parties 
<A NAME="406"></A>of the people and the few. And so Pericles, at that time, more than at 
<A NAME="407"></A>any other, let loose the reins to the people, and made his policy subservient 
<A NAME="408"></A>to their pleasure, contriving continually to have some great public show 
<A NAME="409"></A>or solemnity, some banquet, or some procession or other in the town to 
<A NAME="410"></A>please them, coaxing his countrymen like children with such delights and 
<A NAME="411"></A>pleasures as were not, however, unedifying. Besides that every year he 
<A NAME="412"></A>sent out threescore galleys, on board of which there were numbers of the 
<A NAME="413"></A>citizens, who were in pay eight months, learning at the same time and practising 
<A NAME="414"></A>the art of seamanship.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR><BR>He sent, moreover, a thousand of them into the Chersonese as planters, 
<A NAME="416"></A>to share the land among them by lot, and five hundred more into the isle 
<A NAME="417"></A>of Naxos, and half that number to Andros, a thousand into Thrace to dwell 
<A NAME="418"></A>among the Bisaltae, and others into Italy, when the city Sybaris, which 
<A NAME="419"></A>now was called Thurii, was to be repeopled. And this he did to ease and 
<A NAME="420"></A>discharge the city of an idle, and, by reason of their idleness, a busy 
<A NAME="421"></A>meddling crowd of people; and at the same time to meet the necessities 
<A NAME="422"></A>and restore the fortunes of the poor townsmen, and to intimidate, also, 
<A NAME="423"></A>and check their allies from attempting any change, by posting such garrisons, 
<A NAME="424"></A>as it were, in the midst of them.
<A NAME="425"></A><BR><BR>That which gave most pleasure and ornament to the city of Athens, 
<A NAME="426"></A>and the greatest admiration and even astonishment to all strangers, and 
<A NAME="427"></A>that which now is Greece's only evidence that the power she boasts of and 
<A NAME="428"></A>her ancient wealth are no romance or idle story, was his construction of 
<A NAME="429"></A>the public and sacred buildings. Yet this was that of all his actions in 
<A NAME="430"></A>the government which his enemies most looked askance upon and cavilled 
<A NAME="431"></A>at in the popular assemblies, crying out how that the commonwealth of Athens 
<A NAME="432"></A>had lost its reputation and was ill-spoken of abroad for removing the common 
<A NAME="433"></A>treasure of the Greeks from the isle of Delos into their own custody; and 
<A NAME="434"></A>how that their fairest excuse for so doing, namely, that they took it away 
<A NAME="435"></A>for fear the barbarians should seize it, and on purpose to secure it in 
<A NAME="436"></A>a safe place, this Pericles had made unavailable, and how that "Greece 
<A NAME="437"></A>cannot but resent it as an insufferable affront, and consider herself to 
<A NAME="438"></A>be tyrannized over openly, when she sees the treasure, which was contributed 
<A NAME="439"></A>by her upon a necessity for the war, wantonly lavished out by us upon our 
<A NAME="440"></A>city, to gild her all over, and to adorn and set her forth, as it were 
<A NAME="441"></A>some vain woman, hung round with precious stones and figures and temples, 
<A NAME="442"></A>which cost a world of money."
<A NAME="443"></A><BR><BR>Pericles, on the other hand, informed the people, that they were 
<A NAME="444"></A>in no way obliged to give any account of those moneys to their allies, 
<A NAME="445"></A>so long as they maintained their defence, and kept off the barbarians from 
<A NAME="446"></A>attacking them; while in the meantime they did not so much as supply one 
<A NAME="447"></A>horse or man or ship, but only found money for the service; "which money," 
<A NAME="448"></A>said he, "is not theirs that give it, but theirs that receive it, if so 
<A NAME="449"></A>be they perform the conditions upon which they receive it." And that it 
<A NAME="450"></A>was good reason, that, now the city was sufficiently provided and stored 
<A NAME="451"></A>with all things necessary for the war, they should convert the overplus 
<A NAME="452"></A>of its wealth to such undertakings as would hereafter, when completed, 
<A NAME="453"></A>give them eternal honour, and, for the present, while in process, freely 
<A NAME="454"></A>supply all the inhabitants with plenty. With their variety of workmanship 
<A NAME="455"></A>and of occasions for service, which summon all arts and trades and require 
<A NAME="456"></A>all hands to be employed about them, they do actually put the whole city, 
<A NAME="457"></A>in a manner, into state-pay; while at the same time she is both beautiful 
<A NAME="458"></A>and maintained by herself. For as those who are of age and strength for 
<A NAME="459"></A>war are provided for and maintained in the armaments abroad by their pay 
<A NAME="460"></A>out of the public stock, so, it being his desire and design that the undisciplined 
<A NAME="461"></A>mechanic multitude that stayed at home should not go without their share 
<A NAME="462"></A>of public salaries, and yet should not have them given them for sitting 
<A NAME="463"></A>still and doing nothing, to that end he thought fit to bring in among them, 
<A NAME="464"></A>with the approbation of the people, these vast projects of buildings and 
<A NAME="465"></A>designs of work, that would be of some continuance before they were finished, 
<A NAME="466"></A>and would give employment to numerous arts, so that the part of the people 
<A NAME="467"></A>that stayed at home might, no less than those that were at sea or in garrisons 
<A NAME="468"></A>or on expeditions, have a fair and just occasion of receiving the benefit 
<A NAME="469"></A>and having their share of the public moneys.
<A NAME="470"></A><BR><BR>The materials were stone, brass, ivory, gold, ebony, cypresswood; 
<A NAME="471"></A>and the arts or trades that wrought and fashioned them were smiths and 
<A NAME="472"></A>carpenters, moulders, founders and braziers, stone-cutters, dyers, goldsmiths, 
<A NAME="473"></A>ivory-workers, painters, embroiderers, turners; those again that conveyed 
<A NAME="474"></A>them to the town for use, merchants and mariners and ship-masters by sea, 
<A NAME="475"></A>and by land, cartwrights, cattle-breeders, wagoners, rope-makers, flax-workers, 
<A NAME="476"></A>shoemakers and leather-dressers, road-makers, miners. And every trade in 
<A NAME="477"></A>the same nature, as a captain in an army has his particular company of 
<A NAME="478"></A>soldiers under him, had its own hired company of journeymen and labourers 
<A NAME="479"></A>belonging to it banded together as in array, to be as it were the instrument 
<A NAME="480"></A>and body for the performance of the service. Thus, to say all in a word, 
<A NAME="481"></A>the occasions and services of these public works distributed plenty through 
<A NAME="482"></A>every age and condition.
<A NAME="483"></A><BR><BR>As then grew the works up, no less stately in size than exquisite 
<A NAME="484"></A>in form, the workmen striving to outvie the material and the design with 
<A NAME="485"></A>the beauty of their workmanship, yet the most wonderful thing of all was 
<A NAME="486"></A>the rapidity of their execution.
<A NAME="487"></A><BR><BR>Undertakings, any one of which singly might have required, they 
<A NAME="488"></A>thought, for their completion, several successions and ages of men, were 
<A NAME="489"></A>every one of them accomplished in the height and prime of one man's political 
<A NAME="490"></A>service. Although they say, too, that Zeuxis once, having heard Agatharchus 
<A NAME="491"></A>the painter boast of despatching his work with speed and ease, replied, 
<A NAME="492"></A>"I take a long time." For ease and speed in doing a thing do not give the 
<A NAME="493"></A>work lasting solidity or exactness of beauty; the expenditure of time allowed 
<A NAME="494"></A>to a man's pains beforehand for the production of a thing is repaid by 
<A NAME="495"></A>way of interest with a vital force for the preservation when once produced. 
<A NAME="496"></A>For which reason Pericles's works are especially admired, as having been 
<A NAME="497"></A>made quickly, to last long. For every particular piece of his work was 
<A NAME="498"></A>immediately, even at that time, for its beauty and elegance, antique; and 
<A NAME="499"></A>yet in its vigour and freshness looks to this day as if it were just executed. 
<A NAME="500"></A>There is a sort of bloom of newness upon those works of his, preserving 
<A NAME="501"></A>them from the touch of time, as if they had some perennial spirit and undying 
<A NAME="502"></A>vitality mingled in the composition of them.
<A NAME="503"></A><BR><BR>Phidias had the oversight of all the works, and was surveyor-general, 
<A NAME="504"></A>though upon the various portions other great masters and workmen were employed. 
<A NAME="505"></A>For Callicrates and Ictinus built the Parthenon; the chapel at Eleusis, 
<A NAME="506"></A>where the mysteries were celebrated, was begun by Coroebus, who erected 
<A NAME="507"></A>the pillars that stand upon the floor or pavement, and joined them to the 
<A NAME="508"></A>architraves; and after his death Metagenes of Xypete added the frieze and 
<A NAME="509"></A>the upper line of columns; Xenocles of Cholargus roofed or arched the lantern 
<A NAME="510"></A>on top of the temple of Castor and Pollux; and the long wall, which Socrates 
<A NAME="511"></A>says he himself heard Pericles propose to the people, was undertaken by 
<A NAME="512"></A>Callicrates. This work Cratinus ridicules, as long in 
<A NAME="513"></A>finishing-
<A NAME="514"></A><BR><BR>"'Tis long since Pericles, if words would do 
<A NAME="515"></A>it,
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>Talked up the wall; yet adds not one mite to it."
<A NAME="517"></A><BR><BR>The Odeum, or music-room, which in its interior was full of seats 
<A NAME="518"></A>and ranges of pillars, and outside had its roof made to slope and descend 
<A NAME="519"></A>from one single point at the top, was constructed, we are told, in imitation 
<A NAME="520"></A>of the King of Persia's Pavilion; this likewise by Pericles's order; which 
<A NAME="521"></A>Cratinus again, in his comedy called the Thracian Women, made an occasion 
<A NAME="522"></A>of raillery-
<A NAME="523"></A><BR><BR>"So, we see here,
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>Jupiter Long-pate Pericles appear,
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>Since ostracism time, he's laid aside his head,
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>And wears the new Odeum in its stead."
<A NAME="527"></A><BR><BR>Pericles, also eager for distinction, then first obtained the decree 
<A NAME="528"></A>for a contest in musical skill to be held yearly at the Panathenaea, and 
<A NAME="529"></A>he himself, being chosen judge, arranged the order and method in which 
<A NAME="530"></A>the competitors should sing and play on the flute and on the harp. And 
<A NAME="531"></A>both at that time, and at other times also, they sat in this music-room 
<A NAME="532"></A>to see and hear all such trials of skill.
<A NAME="533"></A><BR><BR>The propylaea, or entrances to the Acropolis, were finished in 
<A NAME="534"></A>five years' time, Mnesicles being the principal architect. A strange accident 
<A NAME="535"></A>happened in the course of building, which showed that the goddess was not 
<A NAME="536"></A>averse to the work, but was aiding and co-operating to bring it to perfection. 
<A NAME="537"></A>One of the artificers, the quickest and the handiest workman among them 
<A NAME="538"></A>all, with a slip of his foot fell down from a great height, and lay in 
<A NAME="539"></A>a miserable condition, the physicians having no hope of his recovery. When 
<A NAME="540"></A>Pericles was in distress about this, Minerva appeared to him at night in 
<A NAME="541"></A>a dream, and ordered a course of treatment, which he applied, and in a 
<A NAME="542"></A>short time and with great ease cured the man. And upon this occasion it 
<A NAME="543"></A>was that he set up a brass statue of Minerva, surnamed Health, in the citadel 
<A NAME="544"></A>near the altar, which they say was there before. But it was Phidias who 
<A NAME="545"></A>wrought the goddess's image in gold, and he has his name inscribed on the 
<A NAME="546"></A>pedestal as the workman of it; and indeed the whole work in a manner was 
<A NAME="547"></A>under his charge, and he had, as we have said already, the oversight over 
<A NAME="548"></A>all the artists and workmen, through Pericles's friendship for him; and 
<A NAME="549"></A>this, indeed, made him much envied, and his patron shamefully slandered 
<A NAME="550"></A>with stories, as if Phidias were in the habit of receiving, for Pericles's 
<A NAME="551"></A>use, freeborn women that came to see the works. The comic writers of the 
<A NAME="552"></A>town, when they had got hold of this story, made much of it, and bespattered 
<A NAME="553"></A>him with all the ribaldry they could invent, charging him falsely with 
<A NAME="554"></A>the wife of Menippus, one who was his friend and served as lieutenant under 
<A NAME="555"></A>him in the wars; and with the birds kept by Pyrilampes, an acquaintance 
<A NAME="556"></A>of Pericles, who, they pretended, used to give presents of peacocks to 
<A NAME="557"></A>Pericles's female friends. And how can one wonder at any number of strange 
<A NAME="558"></A>assertions from men whose whole lives were devoted to mockery, and who 
<A NAME="559"></A>were ready at any time to sacrifice the reputation of their superiors to 
<A NAME="560"></A>vulgar envy and spite, as to some evil genius, when even Stesimbrotus the 
<A NAME="561"></A>Thracian has dared to lay to the charge of Pericles a monstrous and fabulous 
<A NAME="562"></A>piece of criminality with his son's wife? So very difficult a matter is 
<A NAME="563"></A>it to trace and find out the truth of anything by history, when, on the 
<A NAME="564"></A>one hand, those who afterwards write it find long periods of time intercepting 
<A NAME="565"></A>their view, and, on the other hand, the contemporary records of any actions 
<A NAME="566"></A>and lives, partly through envy and ill-will, partly through favour and 
<A NAME="567"></A>flattery, pervert and distort truth.
<A NAME="568"></A><BR><BR>When the orators, who sided with Thucydides and his party, were 
<A NAME="569"></A>at one time crying out, as their custom was, against Pericles, as one who 
<A NAME="570"></A>squandered away the public money, and made havoc of the state revenues, 
<A NAME="571"></A>he rose in the open assembly and put the question to the people, whether 
<A NAME="572"></A>they thought that he had laid out much; and they saying, "Too much, a great 
<A NAME="573"></A>deal," "Then," said he, "since it is so, let the cost not go to your account, 
<A NAME="574"></A>but to mine; and let the inscription upon the buildings stand in my name." 
<A NAME="575"></A>When they heard him say thus, whether it were out of a surprise to see 
<A NAME="576"></A>the greatness of his spirit or out of emulation of the glory of the works, 
<A NAME="577"></A>they cried aloud, bidding him to spend on, and lay out what he thought 
<A NAME="578"></A>fit from the public purse, and to spare no cost, till all were 
<A NAME="579"></A>finished.
<A NAME="580"></A><BR><BR>At length, coming to a final contest with Thucydides which of the 
<A NAME="581"></A>two should ostracism the other out of the country, and having gone through 
<A NAME="582"></A>this peril, he threw his antagonist out, and broke up the confederacy that 
<A NAME="583"></A>had been organized against him. So that now all schism and division being 
<A NAME="584"></A>at an end, and the city brought to evenness and unity, he got all Athens 
<A NAME="585"></A>and all affairs that pertained to the Athenians into his own hands, their 
<A NAME="586"></A>tributes, their armies, and their galleys, the islands, the sea, and their 
<A NAME="587"></A>wide-extended power, partly over other Greeks and partly over barbarians, 
<A NAME="588"></A>and all that empire, which they possessed, founded and fortified upon subject 
<A NAME="589"></A>nations and royal friendships and alliance.
<A NAME="590"></A><BR><BR>After this he was no longer the same man he had been before, nor 
<A NAME="591"></A>as tame and gentle and familiar as formerly with the populace, so as readily 
<A NAME="592"></A>to yield to their pleasures and to comply with the desires of the multitude, 
<A NAME="593"></A>as a steersman shifts with the winds. Quitting that loose, remiss, and, 
<A NAME="594"></A>in some cases, licentious court of the popular will, he turned those soft 
<A NAME="595"></A>and flowery modulations to the austerity of aristocratical and regal rule; 
<A NAME="596"></A>and employing this uprightly and undeviatingly for the country's best interests, 
<A NAME="597"></A>he was able generally to lead the people along, with their own wills and 
<A NAME="598"></A>consents, by persuading and showing them what was to be done; and sometimes, 
<A NAME="599"></A>too, urging and pressing them forward extremely against their will, he 
<A NAME="600"></A>made them, whether they would or no, yield submission to what was for their 
<A NAME="601"></A>advantage. In which, to say the truth, he did but like a skilful physician, 
<A NAME="602"></A>who, in a complicated and chronic disease, as he sees occasion, at one 
<A NAME="603"></A>while allows his patient the moderate use of such things as please him, 
<A NAME="604"></A>at another while gives him keen pains and drug to work the cure. For there 
<A NAME="605"></A>arising and growing up, as was natural, all manner of distempered feelings 
<A NAME="606"></A>among a people which had so vast a command and dominion, he alone, as a 
<A NAME="607"></A>great master, knowing how to handle and deal fitly with each one of them, 
<A NAME="608"></A>and, in an especial manner, making that use of hopes and fears, as his 
<A NAME="609"></A>two chief rudders, with the one to check the career of their confidence 
<A NAME="610"></A>at any time, with the other to raise them up and cheer them when under 
<A NAME="611"></A>any discouragement, plainly showed by this, that rhetoric, or the art of 
<A NAME="612"></A>speaking, is, in Plato's language, the government of the souls of men, 
<A NAME="613"></A>and that her chief business is to address the affections and passions, 
<A NAME="614"></A>which are as it were the strings and keys to the soul, and require a skilful 
<A NAME="615"></A>and careful touch to be played on as they should be. The source of this 
<A NAME="616"></A>predominance was not barely his power of language, but, as Thucydides assures 
<A NAME="617"></A>us, the reputation of his life, and the confidence felt in his character; 
<A NAME="618"></A>his manifest freedom from every kind of corruption, and superiority to 
<A NAME="619"></A>all considerations of money. Notwithstanding he had made the city of Athens, 
<A NAME="620"></A>which was great of itself, as great and rich as can be imagined, and though 
<A NAME="621"></A>he were himself in power and interest more than equal to many kings and 
<A NAME="622"></A>absolute rulers, who some of them also bequeathed by will their power to 
<A NAME="623"></A>their children, he, for his part, did not make the patrimony his father 
<A NAME="624"></A>left him greater than it was by one drachma.
<A NAME="625"></A><BR><BR>Thucydides, indeed, gives a plain statement of the greatness of 
<A NAME="626"></A>his power; and the comic poets, in their spiteful manner, more than hint 
<A NAME="627"></A>at it, styling his companions and friends the new Pisistratidae, and calling 
<A NAME="628"></A>on him to abjure any intention of usurpation, as one whose eminence was 
<A NAME="629"></A>too great to be any longer proportionable to and compatible with a democracy 
<A NAME="630"></A>or popular government. And Teleclides says the Athenians had surrendered 
<A NAME="631"></A>up to him-
<A NAME="632"></A><BR><BR>"The tribute of the cities, and with them, the cities 
<A NAME="633"></A>too,
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>to do with them as he pleases, and undo;
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>To build up, if he likes, stone walls around a town; and 
<A NAME="636"></A>again,
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>if so he likes, to pull them down;
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>Their treaties and alliances, power, empire, peace, and 
<A NAME="639"></A>war,
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>their wealth and their success forever more."
<A NAME="641"></A><BR><BR>Nor was all this the luck of some happy occasion; nor was it the 
<A NAME="642"></A>mere bloom and grace of a policy that flourished for a season; but having 
<A NAME="643"></A>for forty years together maintained the first place among statesmen such 
<A NAME="644"></A>as Ephialtes and Leocrates and Myronides and Cimon and Tolmides and Thucydides 
<A NAME="645"></A>were, after the defeat and banishment of Thucydides, for no less than fifteen 
<A NAME="646"></A>years longer, in the exercise of one continuous unintermitted command in 
<A NAME="647"></A>the office, to which he was annually re-elected, of General, he preserved 
<A NAME="648"></A>his integrity unspotted; though otherwise he was not altogether idle or 
<A NAME="649"></A>careless in looking after his pecuniary advantage; his paternal estate, 
<A NAME="650"></A>which of right belonged to him, he so ordered that it might neither through 
<A NAME="651"></A>negligence he wasted or lessened, nor yet, being so full of business as 
<A NAME="652"></A>he was, cost him any great trouble or time with taking care of it; and 
<A NAME="653"></A>put it into such a way of management as he thought to be the most easy 
<A NAME="654"></A>for himself, and the most exact. All his yearly products and profits he 
<A NAME="655"></A>sold together in a lump, and supplied his household needs afterwards by 
<A NAME="656"></A>buying everything that he or his family wanted out of the market. Upon 
<A NAME="657"></A>which account, his children, when they grew to age, were not well pleased 
<A NAME="658"></A>with his management, and the women that lived with him were treated with 
<A NAME="659"></A>little cost, and complained of his way of housekeeping, where everything 
<A NAME="660"></A>was ordered and set down from day to day, and reduced to the greatest exactness; 
<A NAME="661"></A>since there was not there, as is usual in a great family and a plentiful 
<A NAME="662"></A>estate, anything to spare, or over and above; but all that went out or 
<A NAME="663"></A>came in, all disbursements and all receipts, proceeded as it were by number 
<A NAME="664"></A>and measure. His manager in all this was a single servant, Evangelus by 
<A NAME="665"></A>name, a man either naturally gifted or instructed by Pericles so as to 
<A NAME="666"></A>excel every one in this art of domestic economy.
<A NAME="667"></A><BR><BR>All this, in truth, was very little in harmony with Anaxagoras's 
<A NAME="668"></A>wisdom; if, indeed, it be true that he, by a kind of divine impulse and 
<A NAME="669"></A>greatness of spirit, voluntarily quitted his house, and left his land to 
<A NAME="670"></A>lie fallow and to be grazed by sheep like a common. But the life of a contemplative 
<A NAME="671"></A>philosopher and that of an active statesman are, I presume, not the same 
<A NAME="672"></A>thing; for the one merely employs, upon great and good objects of thought, 
<A NAME="673"></A>an intelligence that requires no aid of instruments nor supply of any external 
<A NAME="674"></A>materials; whereas the other, who tempers and applies his virtue to human 
<A NAME="675"></A>uses, may have occasion for affluence, not as a matter of necessity, but 
<A NAME="676"></A>as a noble thing; which was Pericles's case, who relieved numerous poor 
<A NAME="677"></A>citizens.
<A NAME="678"></A><BR><BR>However, there is a story that Anaxagoras himself, while Pericles 
<A NAME="679"></A>was taken up with public affairs, lay neglected, and that, now being grown 
<A NAME="680"></A>old, he wrapped himself up with a resolution to die for want of food; which 
<A NAME="681"></A>being by chance brought to Pericles's ear, he was horror-struck, and instantly 
<A NAME="682"></A>ran thither, and used all the arguments and entreaties he could to him, 
<A NAME="683"></A>lamenting not so much Anaxagoras's condition as his own, should he lose 
<A NAME="684"></A>such a counsellor as he had found him to be; and that, upon this, Anaxagoras 
<A NAME="685"></A>unfolded his robe, and showing himself, made answer: "Pericles," said he, 
<A NAME="686"></A>"even those who have occasion for a lamp supply it with 
<A NAME="687"></A>oil."
<A NAME="688"></A><BR><BR>The Lacedaemonians beginning to show themselves troubled at the 
<A NAME="689"></A>growth of the Athenian power, Pericles, on the other hand, to elevate the 
<A NAME="690"></A>people's spirit yet more, and to raise them to the thought of great actions, 
<A NAME="691"></A>proposed a decree, to summon all the Greeks in what, part soever, whether 
<A NAME="692"></A>of Europe or Asia, every city, little as well as great, to send their deputies 
<A NAME="693"></A>to Athens to a general assembly, or convention, there to consult and advise 
<A NAME="694"></A>concerning the Greek temples which the barbarians had burnt down, and the 
<A NAME="695"></A>sacrifices which were due from them upon vows they had made to their gods 
<A NAME="696"></A>for the safety of Greece when they fought against the barbarians; and also 
<A NAME="697"></A>concerning the navigation of the sea, that they might henceforward pass 
<A NAME="698"></A>to and fro and trade securely and be at peace among 
<A NAME="699"></A>themselves.
<A NAME="700"></A><BR><BR>Upon this errand there were twenty men, of such as were above fifty 
<A NAME="701"></A>years of age, sent by commission; five to summon the Ionians and Dorians 
<A NAME="702"></A>in Asia, and the islanders as far as Lesbos and Rhodes; five to visit all 
<A NAME="703"></A>the places in the Hellespont and Thrace, up to Byzantium; and other five 
<A NAME="704"></A>besides these to go to Boeotia and Phocis and Peloponnesus, and from hence 
<A NAME="705"></A>to pass through the Locrians over to the neighbouring continent as far 
<A NAME="706"></A>as Acarnania and Ambracia; and the rest to take their course through Euboea 
<A NAME="707"></A>to the Oetaeans and the Malian Gulf, and to the Achaeans of Phthiotis and 
<A NAME="708"></A>the Thessalians; all of them to treat with the people as they passed, and 
<A NAME="709"></A>persuade them to come and take their part in the debates for settling the 
<A NAME="710"></A>peace and jointly regulating the affairs of Greece.
<A NAME="711"></A><BR><BR>Nothing was effected, nor did the cities meet by their deputies, 
<A NAME="712"></A>as was desired; the Lacedaemonians, as it is said, crossing the design 
<A NAME="713"></A>underhand, and the attempt being disappointed and baffled first in Peloponnesus. 
<A NAME="714"></A>I thought fit, however, to introduce the mention of it, to show the spirit 
<A NAME="715"></A>of the man and the greatness of his thoughts.
<A NAME="716"></A><BR><BR>In his military conduct, he gained a great reputation for wariness; 
<A NAME="717"></A>he would not by his good-will engage in any fight which had much uncertainty 
<A NAME="718"></A>or hazard; he did not envy the glory of generals whose rash adventures 
<A NAME="719"></A>fortune favoured with brilliant success, however they were admired by others; 
<A NAME="720"></A>nor did he think them worthy his imitation, but always used to say to his 
<A NAME="721"></A>citizens that, so far as lay in his power, they should continue immortal, 
<A NAME="722"></A>and live for ever. Seeing Tolmides, the son of Tolmaeus, upon the confidence 
<A NAME="723"></A>of his former successes, and flushed with the honour his military actions 
<A NAME="724"></A>had procured him, making preparations to attack the Boeotians in their 
<A NAME="725"></A>own country when there was no likely opportunity, and that he had prevailed 
<A NAME="726"></A>with the bravest and most enterprising of the youth to enlist themselves 
<A NAME="727"></A>as volunteers in the service, who besides his other force made up a thousand, 
<A NAME="728"></A>he endeavoured to withhold him and to advise him from it in the public 
<A NAME="729"></A>assembly, telling him in a memorable saying of his, which still goes about, 
<A NAME="730"></A>that, if he would not take Pericles's advice, yet he would not do amiss 
<A NAME="731"></A>to wait and be ruled by time, the wisest counsellor of all. This saying, 
<A NAME="732"></A>at that time, was but slightly commended; but within a few days after, 
<A NAME="733"></A>when news was brought that Tolmides himself had been defeated and slain 
<A NAME="734"></A>in battle near Coronea, and that many brave citizens had fallen with him, 
<A NAME="735"></A>it gained him great repute as well as good-will among the people, for wisdom 
<A NAME="736"></A>and for love of his countrymen.
<A NAME="737"></A><BR><BR>But of all his expeditions, that to the Chersonese gave most satisfaction 
<A NAME="738"></A>and pleasure, having proved the safety of the Greeks who inhabited there. 
<A NAME="739"></A>For not only by carrying along with him a thousand fresh citizens of Athens 
<A NAME="740"></A>he gave new strength and vigour to the cities, but also by belting the 
<A NAME="741"></A>neck of land, which joins the peninsula to the continent, with bulwarks 
<A NAME="742"></A>and forts from sea to sea, he put a stop to the inroads of the Thracians, 
<A NAME="743"></A>who lay all about the Chersonese, and closed the door against a continual 
<A NAME="744"></A>and grievous war, with which that country had been long harassed, lying 
<A NAME="745"></A>exposed to the encroachments and influx of barbarous neighbours, and groaning 
<A NAME="746"></A>under the evils of a predatory population both upon and within its 
<A NAME="747"></A>borders.
<A NAME="748"></A><BR><BR>Nor was he less admired and talked of abroad for his sailing around 
<A NAME="749"></A>the Peloponnesus, having set out from Pegae, or The Fountains, the port 
<A NAME="750"></A>of Megara, with a hundred galleys. For he not only laid waste the sea-coast, 
<A NAME="751"></A>as Tolmides had done before, but also, advancing far up into the mainland 
<A NAME="752"></A>with the soldiers he had on board, by the terror of his appearance drove 
<A NAME="753"></A>many within their walls; and at Nemea, with main force, routed and raised 
<A NAME="754"></A>a trophy over the Sicyonians, who stood their ground and joined battle 
<A NAME="755"></A>with him. And having taken on board a supply of soldiers into the galleys 
<A NAME="756"></A>out of Achaia, then in league with Athens, he crossed with the fleet to 
<A NAME="757"></A>the opposite continent, and, sailing along by the mouth of the river Achelous, 
<A NAME="758"></A>overran Acarnania and shut up the Oeniadae within their city walls, and 
<A NAME="759"></A>having ravaged and wasted their country, weighed anchor for home with the 
<A NAME="760"></A>double advantage of having shown himself formidable to his enemies, and 
<A NAME="761"></A>at the same time safe and energetic to his fellow citizens; for there was 
<A NAME="762"></A>not so much as any chance miscarriage that happened, the whole voyage through, 
<A NAME="763"></A>to those who were under his charge.
<A NAME="764"></A><BR><BR>Entering also the Euxine Sea with a large and finely equipped fleet, 
<A NAME="765"></A>he obtained for the Greek cities any new arrangements they wanted, and 
<A NAME="766"></A>entered into friendly relations with them; and to the barbarous nations, 
<A NAME="767"></A>and kings and chiefs round about them, displayed the greatness of the power 
<A NAME="768"></A>of the Athenians, their perfect ability avid confidence to sail where-ever 
<A NAME="769"></A>they had a mind, and to bring the whole sea under their control. He left 
<A NAME="770"></A>the Sinopians thirteen ships of war, with soldiers under the command of 
<A NAME="771"></A>Lamachus, to assist them against Timesileus the tyrant; and when he and 
<A NAME="772"></A>his accomplices had been thrown out, obtained a decree that six hundred 
<A NAME="773"></A>of the Athenians that were willing should sail to Sinope and plant themselves 
<A NAME="774"></A>there with the Sinopians, sharing among them the houses and land which 
<A NAME="775"></A>the tyrant and his party had previously held.
<A NAME="776"></A><BR><BR>But in other things he did not comply with the giddy impulses of 
<A NAME="777"></A>the citizens, nor quit his own resolutions to follow their fancies, when, 
<A NAME="778"></A>carried away with the thought of their strength and great success, they 
<A NAME="779"></A>were eager to interfere again in Egypt, and to disturb the King of Persia's 
<A NAME="780"></A>maritime dominions. Nay, there were a good many who were, even then, possessed 
<A NAME="781"></A>with that unblest and inauspicious passion for Sicily, which afterward 
<A NAME="782"></A>the orators of Alcibiades's party blew up into a flame. There were some 
<A NAME="783"></A>also who dreamt of Tuscany and Carthage, and not without plausible reason 
<A NAME="784"></A>in their present large dominion and prosperous course of their 
<A NAME="785"></A>affairs.
<A NAME="786"></A><BR><BR>But Pericles curbed this passion for foreign conquest, and unsparingly 
<A NAME="787"></A>pruned and cut down their ever busy fancies for a multitude of undertakings; 
<A NAME="788"></A>and directed their power for the most part to securing and consolidating 
<A NAME="789"></A>what they had already got, supposing it would be quite enough for them 
<A NAME="790"></A>to do, if they could keep the Lacedaemonians in check; to whom he entertained 
<A NAME="791"></A>all along a sense of opposition; which, as upon many other occasions, so 
<A NAME="792"></A>he particularly showed by what he did in the time of the holy war. The 
<A NAME="793"></A>Lacedaemonians, having gone with an army to Delphi, restored Apollo's temple, 
<A NAME="794"></A>which the Phocians had got into their possession, to the Delphians; immediately 
<A NAME="795"></A>after their departure, Pericles, with another army, came and restored the 
<A NAME="796"></A>Phocians. And the Lacedaemonians, having engraven the record of their privilege 
<A NAME="797"></A>of consulting the oracle before others, which the Delphians gave them, 
<A NAME="798"></A>upon the forehead of the brazen wolf which stands there, he, also, having 
<A NAME="799"></A>received from the Phocians the like privilege for the Athenians, had it 
<A NAME="800"></A>cut upon the same wolf of brass on his right side.
<A NAME="801"></A><BR><BR>That he did well and wisely in thus restraining the exertions of 
<A NAME="802"></A>the Athenians within the compass of Greece, the events themselves that 
<A NAME="803"></A>happened afterward bore sufficient witness. For, in the first place, the 
<A NAME="804"></A>Euboeans revolted, against whom he passed over with forces; and then, immediately 
<A NAME="805"></A>after, news came that the Megarians were turned their enemies; and a hostile 
<A NAME="806"></A>army was upon the borders of Attica, under the conduct of Plistoanax, King 
<A NAME="807"></A>of the Lacedaemonians. Wherefore Pericles came with his army back again 
<A NAME="808"></A>in all haste out of Euboea, to meet the war which threatened at home; and 
<A NAME="809"></A>did not venture to engage a numerous and brave army eager for battle; but 
<A NAME="810"></A>perceiving that Plistoanax was a very young man, and governed himself mostly 
<A NAME="811"></A>by the counsel and advice of Cleandrides, whom the ephors had sent with 
<A NAME="812"></A>him, by reason of his youth, to be a kind of guardian and assistant to 
<A NAME="813"></A>him, he privately made trial of this man's integrity, and, in a short time, 
<A NAME="814"></A>having corrupted him with money, prevailed with him to withdraw the Peloponnesians 
<A NAME="815"></A>out of Attica. When the army had retired and dispersed into their several 
<A NAME="816"></A>states, the Lacedaemonians in anger fined their king in so large a sum 
<A NAME="817"></A>of money, that, unable to pay it, he quitted Lacedaemon; while Cleandrides 
<A NAME="818"></A>fled, and had sentence of death passed upon him in his absence. This was 
<A NAME="819"></A>the father of Gylippus, who overpowered the Athenians in Sicily. And it 
<A NAME="820"></A>seems that this covetousness was an hereditary disease transmitted from 
<A NAME="821"></A>father to son; for Gylippus also afterwards was caught in foul practices, 
<A NAME="822"></A>and expelled from Sparta for it. But this we have told at large in the 
<A NAME="823"></A>account of Lysander.
<A NAME="824"></A><BR><BR>When Pericles, in giving up his accounts of this expedition, stated 
<A NAME="825"></A>a disbursement of ten talents, as laid out upon fit occasion, the people, 
<A NAME="826"></A>without any question, nor troubling themselves to investigate the mystery, 
<A NAME="827"></A>freely allowed of it. And some historians, in which number is Theophrastus 
<A NAME="828"></A>the philosopher, have given it as a truth that Pericles every year used 
<A NAME="829"></A>to send privately the sum of ten talents to Sparta, with which he complimented 
<A NAME="830"></A>those in office, to keep off the war; not to purchase peace neither, but 
<A NAME="831"></A>time, that he might prepare at leisure, and be the better able to carry 
<A NAME="832"></A>on war hereafter.
<A NAME="833"></A><BR><BR>Immediately after this, turning his forces against the revolters, 
<A NAME="834"></A>and passing over into the island of Euboea with fifty sail of ships and 
<A NAME="835"></A>five thousand men in arms, he reduced their cities, and drove out the citizens 
<A NAME="836"></A>of the Chalcidians, called Hippobotae, horse-feeders, the chief persons 
<A NAME="837"></A>for wealth and reputation among them; and removing all the Histiaeans out 
<A NAME="838"></A>of the country, brought in a plantation of Athenians in their room; making 
<A NAME="839"></A>them his one example of severity, because they had captured an Attic ship 
<A NAME="840"></A>and killed all on board.
<A NAME="841"></A><BR><BR>After this, having made a truce between the Athenians and Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="842"></A>for thirty years, he ordered, by public decree, the expedition against 
<A NAME="843"></A>the isle of Samos, on the ground, that, when they were bid to leave off 
<A NAME="844"></A>their war with the Milesians they had not complied. And as these measures 
<A NAME="845"></A>against the Samians are thought to have been taken to please Aspasia, this 
<A NAME="846"></A>may be a fit point for inquiry about the woman, what art or charming faculty 
<A NAME="847"></A>she had that enabled her to captivate, as she did, the greatest statesmen, 
<A NAME="848"></A>and to give the philosophers occasion to speak so much about her, and that, 
<A NAME="849"></A>too, not to her disparagement. That she was a Milesian by birth, the daughter 
<A NAME="850"></A>of Axiochus, is a thing acknowledged. And they say it was in emulation 
<A NAME="851"></A>of Thargelia, a courtesan of the old Ionian times, that she made her addresses 
<A NAME="852"></A>to men of great power. Thargelia was a great beauty, extremely charming, 
<A NAME="853"></A>and at the same time sagacious; she had numerous suitors among the Greeks, 
<A NAME="854"></A>and brought all who had to do with her over to the Persian interest, and 
<A NAME="855"></A>by their means, being men of the greatest power and station, sowed the 
<A NAME="856"></A>seeds of the Median faction up and down in several cities. Aspasia, some 
<A NAME="857"></A>say, was courted and caressed by Pericles upon account of her knowledge 
<A NAME="858"></A>and skill in politics. Socrates himself would sometimes go to visit her, 
<A NAME="859"></A>and some of his acquaintance with him; and those who frequented her company 
<A NAME="860"></A>would carry their wives with them to listen to her. Her occupation was 
<A NAME="861"></A>anything but creditable, her house being a home for young courtesans. Aeschines 
<A NAME="862"></A>tells us, also, that Lysicles, a sheep-dealer, a man of low birth and character, 
<A NAME="863"></A>by keeping Aspasia company after Pericles's death, came to be a chief man 
<A NAME="864"></A>in Athens. And in Plato's Menexenus, though we do not take the introduction 
<A NAME="865"></A>as quite serious, still thus much seems to be historical, that she had 
<A NAME="866"></A>the repute of being resorted to by many of the Athenians for instruction 
<A NAME="867"></A>in the art of speaking. Pericles's inclination for her seems, however, 
<A NAME="868"></A>to have rather proceeded from the passion of love. He had a wife that was 
<A NAME="869"></A>near of kin to him, who had been married first to Hipponicus, by whom she 
<A NAME="870"></A>had Callias, surnamed the Rich; and also she brought Pericles, while she 
<A NAME="871"></A>lived with him, two sons, Xanthippus and Paralus. Afterwards, when they 
<A NAME="872"></A>did not well agree, nor like to live together, he parted with her, with 
<A NAME="873"></A>her own consent, to another man, and himself took Aspasia, and loved her 
<A NAME="874"></A>with wonderful affection; every day, both as he went out and as he came 
<A NAME="875"></A>in from the market-place, he saluted and kissed her.
<A NAME="876"></A><BR><BR>In the comedies she goes by the nicknames of the new Omphale and 
<A NAME="877"></A>Deianira, and again is styled Juno. Cratinus, in downright terms, calls 
<A NAME="878"></A>her a harlot.
<A NAME="879"></A><BR><BR>"To find him a Juno the goddess of lust
<A NAME="880"></A><BR>Bore that harlot past shame,
<A NAME="881"></A><BR>Aspasia by name." It should seem also that he had a son by her; Eupolis, 
<A NAME="882"></A>in his Demi, introduced Pericles asking after his safety, and Myronides 
<A NAME="883"></A>replying-
<A NAME="884"></A><BR><BR>"My son?" "He lives: a man he had been long,
<A NAME="885"></A><BR>But that the harlot-mother did him wrong." Aspasia, they say, became 
<A NAME="886"></A>so celebrated and renowned, that Cyrus, also who made war against Artaxerxes 
<A NAME="887"></A>for the Persian monarchy, gave her whom he loved the best of all his concubines 
<A NAME="888"></A>the name of Aspasia, who before that was called Milto. She was a Phocaean 
<A NAME="889"></A>by birth, the daughter of one Hermotimus, and, when Cyrus fell in battle, 
<A NAME="890"></A>was carried to the king, and had great influence at court. These things 
<A NAME="891"></A>coming into my memory as I am writing this story, it would be unnatural 
<A NAME="892"></A>for me to omit them.
<A NAME="893"></A><BR><BR>Pericles, however, was particularly charged with having proposed 
<A NAME="894"></A>to the assembly the war against the Samians, from favour to the Milesians, 
<A NAME="895"></A>upon the entreaty of Aspasia. For the two states were at war for the possession 
<A NAME="896"></A>of Priene; and the Samians, getting the better, refused to lay down their 
<A NAME="897"></A>arms and to have the controversy betwixt them decided by arbitration before 
<A NAME="898"></A>the Athenians. Pericles, therefore, fitting out a fleet, went and broke 
<A NAME="899"></A>up the oligarchical government at Samos, and taking fifty of the principal 
<A NAME="900"></A>men of the town as hostages, and as many of their children, sent them to 
<A NAME="901"></A>the isle of Lemnos, there to be kept, though he had offers, as some relate, 
<A NAME="902"></A>of a talent apiece for himself from each one of the hostages, and of many 
<A NAME="903"></A>other presents from those who were anxious not to have a democracy. Moreover, 
<A NAME="904"></A>Pisuthnes the Persian, one of the king's lieutenants, bearing some good-will 
<A NAME="905"></A>to the Samians, sent him ten thousand pieces of gold to excuse the city. 
<A NAME="906"></A>Pericles, however, would receive none of all this; but after he had taken 
<A NAME="907"></A>that course with the Samians which he thought fit, and set up a democracy 
<A NAME="908"></A>among them, sailed back to Athens.
<A NAME="909"></A><BR><BR>But they, however, immediately revolted, Pisuthnes having privily 
<A NAME="910"></A>got away their hostages for them, and provided them with means for the 
<A NAME="911"></A>war. Whereupon Pericles came out with a fleet a second time against them, 
<A NAME="912"></A>and found them not idle nor slinking away, but manfully resolved to try 
<A NAME="913"></A>for the dominion of the sea. The issue was, that after a sharp sea-fight 
<A NAME="914"></A>about the island called Tragia, Pericles obtained a decisive victory, having 
<A NAME="915"></A>with forty-four ships routed seventy of the enemy's, twenty of which were 
<A NAME="916"></A>carrying soldiers.
<A NAME="917"></A><BR><BR>Together with his victory and pursuit, having made himself master 
<A NAME="918"></A>of the port, he laid siege to the Samians, and blocked them up, who yet, 
<A NAME="919"></A>one way or another, still ventured to make sallies, and fight under the 
<A NAME="920"></A>city walls. But after that another greater fleet from Athens was arrived, 
<A NAME="921"></A>and that the Samians were now shut up with a close leaguer on every side, 
<A NAME="922"></A>Pericles, taking with him sixty galleys, sailed out into the main sea, 
<A NAME="923"></A>with the intention, as most authors give the account, to meet a squadron 
<A NAME="924"></A>of Phoenician ships that were coming for the Samians' relief, and to fight 
<A NAME="925"></A>them at as great distance as could be from the island; but, as Stesimbrotus 
<A NAME="926"></A>says, with a design of putting over to Cyprus, which does not seem to be 
<A NAME="927"></A>probable. But, whichever of the two was his intention, it seems to have 
<A NAME="928"></A>been a miscalculation. For on his departure, Melissus, the son of Ithagenes, 
<A NAME="929"></A>a philosopher, being at that time the general in Samos, despising either 
<A NAME="930"></A>the small number of the ships that were left or the inexperience of the 
<A NAME="931"></A>commanders, prevailed with the citizens to attack the Athenians. And the 
<A NAME="932"></A>Samians having won the battle, and taken several of the men prisoners, 
<A NAME="933"></A>and disabled several of the ships, were masters of the sea, and brought 
<A NAME="934"></A>into port all necessaries they wanted for the war, which they had not before. 
<A NAME="935"></A>Aristotle says, too, that Pericles had been once before this worsted by 
<A NAME="936"></A>this Melissus in a sea-fight.
<A NAME="937"></A><BR><BR>The Samians, that they might requite an affront which had before 
<A NAME="938"></A>been put upon them, branded the Athenians, whom they took prisoners, in 
<A NAME="939"></A>their foreheads, with the figure of an owl. For so the Athenians had marked 
<A NAME="940"></A>them before with a Samaena, which is a sort of ship, low and flat in the 
<A NAME="941"></A>prow, so as to look snub-nosed, but wide and large and well-spread in the 
<A NAME="942"></A>hold, by which it both carries a large cargo and sails well. And it was 
<A NAME="943"></A>so called, because the first of that kind was seen at Samos, having been 
<A NAME="944"></A>built by order of Polycrates the tyrant. These brands upon the Samians' 
<A NAME="945"></A>foreheads, they say, are the allusion in the passage of Aristophanes, where 
<A NAME="946"></A>he says-
<A NAME="947"></A><BR><BR>"For, oh, the Samians are a lettered people."
<A NAME="948"></A><BR><BR>Pericles, as soon as news was brought him of the disaster that 
<A NAME="949"></A>had befallen his army, made all the haste he could to come in to their 
<A NAME="950"></A>relief, and having defeated Melissus, who bore up against him, and put 
<A NAME="951"></A>the enemy to flight, he immediately proceeded to hem them in with a wall, 
<A NAME="952"></A>resolving to master them and take the town, rather with some cost and time 
<A NAME="953"></A>than with the wounds and hazards of his citizens. But as it was a hard 
<A NAME="954"></A>matter to keep back the Athenians, who were vexed at the delay, and were 
<A NAME="955"></A>eagerly bent to fight, he divided the whole multitude into eight parts, 
<A NAME="956"></A>and arranged by lot that that part which had the white bean should have 
<A NAME="957"></A>leave to feast and take their ease while the other seven were fighting. 
<A NAME="958"></A>And this is the reason, they say, that people, when at any time they have 
<A NAME="959"></A>been merry, and enjoyed themselves, called it white day, in allusion to 
<A NAME="960"></A>this white bean.
<A NAME="961"></A><BR><BR>Ephorus the historian tells us besides, that Pericles made use 
<A NAME="962"></A>of engines of battery in this siege, being much taken with the curiousness 
<A NAME="963"></A>of the invention, with the aid and presence of Artemon himself, the engineer, 
<A NAME="964"></A>who, being lame, used to be carried about in a litter, where the works 
<A NAME="965"></A>required his attendance, and for that reason was called Periphoretus. But 
<A NAME="966"></A>Heraclides Ponticus disproves this out of Anacreon's poems, where mention 
<A NAME="967"></A>is made of this Artemon Periphoretus several ages before the Samian war, 
<A NAME="968"></A>or any of these occurrences. And he says that Artemon, being a man who 
<A NAME="969"></A>loved his ease, and had a great apprehension of danger, for the most part 
<A NAME="970"></A>kept close within doors, having two of his servants to hold a brazen shield 
<A NAME="971"></A>over his head, that nothing might fall upon him from above; and if he were 
<A NAME="972"></A>at any time forced upon necessity to go abroad, that he was carried about 
<A NAME="973"></A>in a little hanging bed, close to the very ground, and that for this reason 
<A NAME="974"></A>he was called Periphoretus.
<A NAME="975"></A><BR><BR>In the ninth month, the Samians surrendering themselves and delivering 
<A NAME="976"></A>up the town, Pericles pulled down their walls, and seized their shipping, 
<A NAME="977"></A>and set a fine of a large sum of money upon them, part of which they paid 
<A NAME="978"></A>down at once, and they agreed to bring in the rest by a certain time, and 
<A NAME="979"></A>gave hostages for security. Duris the Samian makes a tragical drama out 
<A NAME="980"></A>of these events, charging the Athenians and Pericles with a great deal 
<A NAME="981"></A>of cruelty, which neither Thucydides, nor Ephorus, nor Aristotle have given 
<A NAME="982"></A>any relation of, and probably with little regard to truth; how, for example, 
<A NAME="983"></A>he brought the captains and soldiers of the alleys into the market-place 
<A NAME="984"></A>at Miletus, and there having bound them fast to boards for ten days, then, 
<A NAME="985"></A>when they were already all but half dead, gave order to have them killed 
<A NAME="986"></A>by beating out their brains with clubs, and their dead bodies to be flung 
<A NAME="987"></A>out into the open streets and fields, unburied. Duris however, who, even 
<A NAME="988"></A>where he has no private feeling concerned, is not wont to keep his narratives 
<A NAME="989"></A>within the limits of truth, is the more likely upon this occasion to have 
<A NAME="990"></A>exaggerated the calamities which befell his country, to create odium against 
<A NAME="991"></A>the Athenians. Pericles however, after the reduction of Samos, returning 
<A NAME="992"></A>back to Athens, took care that those who died in the war should be honourably 
<A NAME="993"></A>buried, and made a funeral harangue, as the custom is, in their commendation 
<A NAME="994"></A>at their graves, for which he gained great admiration. As he came down 
<A NAME="995"></A>from the stage on which he spoke, the rest of the women came and complimented 
<A NAME="996"></A>him, taking him by the hand, and crowning him with garlands and ribbons, 
<A NAME="997"></A>like a victorious athlete in the games; but Elpinice, coming near to him, 
<A NAME="998"></A>said, "These are brave deeds, Pericles, that you have done, and such as 
<A NAME="999"></A>deserve our chaplets; who have lost us many a worthy citizen, not in a 
<A NAME="1000"></A>war with Phoenicians or Medes, like my brother Cimon, but for the overthrow 
<A NAME="1001"></A>of an allied and kindred city." As Elpinice spoke these words, he, smiling 
<A NAME="1002"></A>quietly, as it is said, returned her answer with this 
<A NAME="1003"></A>verse:-
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR><BR>"Old women should not seek to be perfumed." Ion says of him, that 
<A NAME="1005"></A>upon this exploit of his, conquering the Samians, he indulged very high 
<A NAME="1006"></A>and proud thoughts of himself: whereas Agamemnon was ten years taking a 
<A NAME="1007"></A>barbarous city, he had in nine months' time vanquished and taken the greatest 
<A NAME="1008"></A>and most powerful of the Ionians. And indeed it was not without reason 
<A NAME="1009"></A>that he assumed this glory to himself, for, in real truth, there was much 
<A NAME="1010"></A>uncertainty and great hazard in this great war, if so be, as Thucydides 
<A NAME="1011"></A>tells us, the Samian state were within a very little of wresting the whole 
<A NAME="1012"></A>power and dominion of the sea out of the Athenians' 
<A NAME="1013"></A>hands.
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR><BR>After this was over, the Peloponnesian war beginning to break out 
<A NAME="1015"></A>in full tide, he advised the people to send help to the Corcyraeans, who 
<A NAME="1016"></A>were attacked by the Corinthians, and to secure to themselves an island 
<A NAME="1017"></A>possessed of great naval resources, since the Peloponnesians were already 
<A NAME="1018"></A>all but in actual hostilities against them. The people readily consenting 
<A NAME="1019"></A>to the motion, and voting an aid and succour for them, he despatched Lacedaemonius, 
<A NAME="1020"></A>Cimon's son, having only ten ships with him, as it were out of a design 
<A NAME="1021"></A>to affront him; for there was a great kindness and friendship betwixt Cimon's 
<A NAME="1022"></A>family and the Lacedaemonians; so, in order that Lacedaemonius might lie 
<A NAME="1023"></A>the more open to a charge, or suspicion at least, of favouring the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="1024"></A>and playing false, if he performed no considerable exploit in this service, 
<A NAME="1025"></A>he allowed him a small number of ships, and sent him out against his will; 
<A NAME="1026"></A>and indeed he made it somewhat his business to hinder Cimon's sons from 
<A NAME="1027"></A>rising in the state, professing that by their very names they were not 
<A NAME="1028"></A>to be looked upon as native and true Athenians, but foreigners and strangers, 
<A NAME="1029"></A>one being called Lacedaemonius, another Thessalus, and the third Eleus 
<A NAME="1030"></A>and they were all three of them, it was thought, born of an Arcadian woman. 
<A NAME="1031"></A>Being, however, ill spoken of on account of these ten galleys, as having 
<A NAME="1032"></A>afforded but a small supply to the people that were in need, and yet given 
<A NAME="1033"></A>a great advantage to those who might complain of the act of intervention, 
<A NAME="1034"></A>Pericles sent out a larger force afterwards to Corcyra, which arrived after 
<A NAME="1035"></A>the fight was over. And when now the Corinthians, angry and indignant with 
<A NAME="1036"></A>the Athenians, accused them publicly at Lacedaemon, the Megarians joined 
<A NAME="1037"></A>with them, complaining that they were, contrary to common right and the 
<A NAME="1038"></A>articles of peace sworn to among the Greeks, kept out and driven away from 
<A NAME="1039"></A>every market and from all ports under the control of the Athenians. The 
<A NAME="1040"></A>Aeginetans, also, professing to be ill-used and treated with violence, 
<A NAME="1041"></A>made supplications in private to the Lacedaemonians for redress, though 
<A NAME="1042"></A>not daring openly to call the Athenians in question. In the meantime, also, 
<A NAME="1043"></A>the city Potidaea, under the dominion of the Athenians, but a colony formerly 
<A NAME="1044"></A>of the Corinthians, had revolted, and was beset with a formal siege, and 
<A NAME="1045"></A>was a further occasion of precipitating the war.
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR><BR>Yet notwithstanding all this, there being embassies sent to Athens, 
<A NAME="1047"></A>and Archidamus, the King of the Lacedaemonians, endeavouring to bring the 
<A NAME="1048"></A>greater part of the complaints and matters in dispute to a fair determination, 
<A NAME="1049"></A>and to pacify and allay the heats of the allies, it is very likely that 
<A NAME="1050"></A>the war would not upon any other grounds of quarrel have fallen upon the 
<A NAME="1051"></A>Athenians, could they have been prevailed with to repeal the ordinance 
<A NAME="1052"></A>against the Megarians, and to be reconciled to them. Upon which account, 
<A NAME="1053"></A>since Pericles was the man who mainly opposed it, and stirred up the people's 
<A NAME="1054"></A>passions to persist in their contention with the Megarians, he was regarded 
<A NAME="1055"></A>as the sole cause of the war.
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR><BR>They say, moreover, that ambassadors went, by order, from Lacedaemon 
<A NAME="1057"></A>to Athens about this very business, and that when Pericles was urging a 
<A NAME="1058"></A>certain law which made it illegal to take down or withdraw the tablet of 
<A NAME="1059"></A>the decree, one of the ambassadors, Polyalces by name, said, "Well, do 
<A NAME="1060"></A>not take it down then, but turn it; there is no law, I suppose, which forbids 
<A NAME="1061"></A>that;" which, though prettily said, did not move Pericles from his resolution. 
<A NAME="1062"></A>There may have been, in all likelihood, something of a secret grudge and 
<A NAME="1063"></A>private animosity which he had against the Megarians. Yet, upon a public 
<A NAME="1064"></A>and open charge against them, that they had appropriated part of the sacred 
<A NAME="1065"></A>land on the frontier, he proposed a decree that a herald should be sent 
<A NAME="1066"></A>to them, and the same also to the Lacedaemonians, with an accusation of 
<A NAME="1067"></A>the Megarians; an order which certainly shows equitable and friendly proceeding 
<A NAME="1068"></A>enough. And after that the herald who was sent, by name Anthemocritus, 
<A NAME="1069"></A>died, and it was believed that the Megarians had contrived his death, then 
<A NAME="1070"></A>Charinus proposed a decree against them, that there should be an irreconcilable 
<A NAME="1071"></A>and implacable enmity thenceforward betwixt the two commonwealths; and 
<A NAME="1072"></A>that if any one of the Megarians should but set his foot in Attica, he 
<A NAME="1073"></A>should be put to death; and that the commanders, when they take the usual 
<A NAME="1074"></A>oath, should, over and above that, swear that they will twice every year 
<A NAME="1075"></A>make an inroad into the Megarian country; and that Anthemocritus should 
<A NAME="1076"></A>be buried near the Thracian Gates, which are now called the Dipylon, or 
<A NAME="1077"></A>Double Gate.
<A NAME="1078"></A><BR><BR>On the other hand, the Megarians, utterly denying and disowning 
<A NAME="1079"></A>the murder of Anthemocritus, throw the whole matter upon Aspasia and Pericles, 
<A NAME="1080"></A>availing themselves of the famous verses in the Acharnians-
<A NAME="1081"></A><BR><BR>"To Megara some of our madcaps ran,
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR>And stole Simaetha thence, their courtesan.
<A NAME="1083"></A><BR>Which exploit the Megarians to outdo,
<A NAME="1084"></A><BR>Came to Aspasia's house, and took off two."
<A NAME="1085"></A><BR><BR>The true occasion of the quarrel is not so easy to find out. But 
<A NAME="1086"></A>of inducing the refusal to annul the decree, all alike charge Pericles. 
<A NAME="1087"></A>Some say he met the request with a positive refusal, out of high spirit 
<A NAME="1088"></A>and a view of the state's best interest, accounting that the demand made 
<A NAME="1089"></A>in those embassies was designed for a trial of their compliance, and that 
<A NAME="1090"></A>a concession would be taken for a confession of weakness as if they durst 
<A NAME="1091"></A>not do otherwise; while other some there are who say that it was rather 
<A NAME="1092"></A>out of arrogance and a willful spirit of contention, to show his own strength, 
<A NAME="1093"></A>that he took occasion to slight the Lacedaemonians. The worst motive of 
<A NAME="1094"></A>all, which is confirmed by most witnesses, is to the following effect: 
<A NAME="1095"></A>Phidias the Moulder had, as has before been said, undertaken to make the 
<A NAME="1096"></A>statue of Minerva. Now he, being admitted to friendship with Pericles, 
<A NAME="1097"></A>and a great favourite of his, had many enemies upon this account, who envied 
<A NAME="1098"></A>and maligned him; who also, to make trial in a case of his, what kind of 
<A NAME="1099"></A>judges the commons would prove, should there be occasion to bring Pericles 
<A NAME="1100"></A>himself before them, having tampered with Menon, one who had been a workman 
<A NAME="1101"></A>with Phidias, stationed him in the market-place, with a petition desiring 
<A NAME="1102"></A>public security upon his discovery and impeachment of Phidias. The people 
<A NAME="1103"></A>admitting the man to tell his story, and the prosecution proceeding in 
<A NAME="1104"></A>the assembly, there was nothing of theft or cheat proved against him; for 
<A NAME="1105"></A>Phidias, from the very first beginning, by the advice of Pericles, had 
<A NAME="1106"></A>so wrought and wrapt the gold that was used in the work

<a></a>about the statue, that they might take it all off, and make out the
<a></a>just weight of it, which Pericles at that time bade the accuser do.
<a></a>But the reputation of his works was what brought envy upon Phidias,
<a></a>especially that where he represents the fight of the Amazons upon
<a></a>the goddess's shield, he had introduced a likeness of himself as a
<a></a>bald old man holding up a great stone with both hands, and had put
<a></a>in a very fine representation of Pericles fighting with an Amazon.
<a></a>And the position of the hand which holds out the spear in front of
<a></a>the face, was ingeniously contrived to conceal in some degree the
<a></a>likeness, which meantime showed itself on either side. 
<br><br><a></a>Phidias then was carried away to prison, and there died of a disease;
<a></a>but, as some say, of poison, administered by the enemies of Pericles,
<a></a>to raise a slander, or a suspicion at least, as though he had procured
<a></a>it. The informer Menon, upon Glycon's proposal, the people made free
<a></a>from payment of taxes and customs, and ordered the generals to take
<a></a>care that nobody should do him any hurt. About the same time, Aspasia
<a></a>was indicted of impiety, upon the complaint of Hermippus the comedian,
<a></a>who also laid further to her charge that she received into her house
<a></a>freeborn women for the uses of Pericles. And Diopithes proposed a
<a></a>decree, that public accusations should be laid against persons who
<a></a>neglected religion, or taught new doctrines about things above, directing
<a></a>suspicion, by means of Anaxagoras, against Pericles himself. The people
<a></a>receiving and admitting these accusations and complaints, at length,
<a></a>by this means, they came to enact a decree, at the motion of Dracontides,
<a></a>that Pericles should bring in the accounts of the moneys he had expended,
<a></a>and lodge them with the Prytanes; and that the judges, carrying their
<a></a>suffrage from the altar in the Acropolis, should examine and determine
<a></a>the business in the city. This last clause Hagnon took out of the
<a></a>decree, and moved that the causes should be tried before fifteen hundred
<a></a>jurors, whether they should be styled prosecutions for robbery, or
<a></a>bribery, or any kind of malversation. Aspasia, Pericles begged off,
<a></a>shedding, as Aeschines says, many tears at the trial, and personally
<a></a>entreating the jurors. But fearing how it might go with Anaxagoras,
<a></a>he sent him out of the city. And finding that in Phidias's case he
<a></a>had miscarried with the people, being afraid of impeachment, he kindled
<a></a>the war, which hitherto had lingered and smothered, and blew it up
<a></a>into a flame; hoping, by that means, to disperse and scatter these
<a></a>complaints and charges, and to allay their jealousy; the city usually
<a></a>throwing herself upon him alone, and trusting to his sole conduct,
<a></a>upon the urgency of great affairs and public dangers, by reason of
<a></a>his authority and the sway he bore. 
<br><br><a></a>These are given out to have been the reasons which induced Pericles
<a></a>not to suffer the people of Athens to yield to the proposals of the
<a></a>Lacedaemonians; but their truth is uncertain. 
<br><br><a></a>The Lacedaemonians, for their part, feeling sure that if they could
<a></a>once remove him, they might be at what terms they pleased with the
<a></a>Athenians, sent them word that they should expel the "Pollution" with
<a></a>which Pericles on the mother's side was tainted, as Thucydides tells
<a></a>us. But the issue proved quite contrary to what those who sent the
<a></a>message expected; instead of bringing Pericles under suspicion and
<a></a>reproach, they raised him into yet greater credit and esteem with
<a></a>the citizens, as a man whom their enemies most hated and feared. In
<a></a>the same way, also, before Archidamus, who was at the head of the
<a></a>Peloponnesians, made his invasion into Attica, he told the Athenians
<a></a>beforehand, that if Archidamus, while he laid waste the rest of the
<a></a>country, should forbear and spare his estate, either on the ground
<a></a>of friendship or right of hospitality that was betwixt them, or on
<a></a>purpose to give his enemies an occasion of traducing him; that then
<a></a>he did freely bestow upon the state all his land and the buildings
<a></a>upon it for the public use. The Lacedaemonians, therefore, and their
<a></a>allies, with a great army, invaded the Athenian territories, under
<a></a>the conduct of King Archidamus, and laying waste the country, marched
<a></a>on as far as Acharnae, and there pitched their camp, presuming that
<a></a>the Athenians would never endure that, but would come out and fight
<a></a>them for their country's and their honour's sake. But Pericles looked
<a></a>upon it as dangerous to engage in battle, to the risk of the city
<a></a>itself, against sixty thousand men-at-arms of Peloponnesians and Boeotians;
<a></a>for so many they were in number that made the inroad at first; and
<a></a>he endeavoured to appease those who were desirous to fight, and were
<a></a>grieved and discontented to see how things went, and gave them good
<a></a>words, saying, that "trees, when they are lopped and cut, grow up
<a></a>again in a short time, but men, being once lost, cannot easily be
<a></a>recovered." He did not convene the people into an assembly, for fear
<a></a>lest they should force him to act against his judgment; but, like
<a></a>a skilful steersman or pilot of a ship, who, when a sudden squall
<a></a>comes on, out at sea, makes all his arrangements, sees that all is
<a></a>tight and fast, and then follows the dictates of his skill, and minds
<a></a>the business of the ship, taking no notice of the tears and entreaties
<a></a>of the sea-sick and fearful passengers, so he, having shut up the
<a></a>city gates, and placed guards at all posts for security, followed
<a></a>his own reason and judgment, little regarding those that cried out
<a></a>against him and were angry at his management, although there were
<a></a>a great many of his friends that urged him with requests, and many
<a></a>of his enemies threatened and accused him for doing as he did, and
<a></a>many made songs and lampoons upon him, which were sung about the town
<a></a>to his disgrace, reproaching him with the cowardly exercise of his
<a></a>office of general, and the tame abandonment of everything to the enemy's
<a></a>hands. 
<br><br><a></a>Cleon, also, already was among his assailants, making use of the feeling
<a></a>against him as a step to the leadership of the people, as appears
<a></a>in the anapaestic verses of Hermippus- 
<br><br><a></a>"Satyr-king, instead of swords, 
<a></a>Will you always handle words? 
<a></a>Very brave indeed we find them, 
<a></a>But a Teles lurks behind them. 
<br><br><a></a>"Yet to gnash your teeth you're seen, 
<a></a>When the little dagger keen, 
<a></a>Whetted every day anew, 
<a></a>Of sharp Cleon touches you." 
<br><br><a></a>Pericles, however, was not at all moved by any attacks, but took all
<a></a>patiently, and submitted in silence to the disgrace they threw upon
<a></a>him and the ill-will they bore him; and, sending out a fleet of a
<a></a>hundred galleys to Peloponnesus, he did not go along with it in person,
<a></a>but stayed behind, that he might watch at home and keep the city under
<a></a>his own control, till the Peloponnesians broke up their camp and were
<a></a>gone. Yet to soothe the common people, jaded and distressed with the
<a></a>war, he relieved them with distributions of public moneys, and ordained
<a></a>new divisions of subject land. For having turned out all the people
<a></a>of Aegina, he parted the island among the Athenians according to lot.
<a></a>Some comfort also, and ease in their miseries, they might receive
<a></a>from what their enemies endured. For the fleet, sailing round the
<a></a>Peloponnese, ravaged a great deal of the country, and pillaged and
<a></a>plundered the towns and smaller cities; and by land he himself entered
<a></a>with an army the Megarian country, and made havoc of it all. Whence
<a></a>it is clear that the Peloponnesians, though they did the Athenians
<a></a>much mischief by land, yet suffering as much themselves from them
<a></a>by sea, would not have protracted the war to such a length, but would
<a></a>quickly have given it over, as Pericles at first foretold they would,
<a></a>had not some divine power crossed human purposes. 
<br><br><a></a>In the first place, the pestilential disease, or plague, seized upon
<a></a>the city, and ate up all the flower and prime of their youth and strength.
<a></a>Upon occasion of which, the people, distempered and afflicted in their
<a></a>souls, as well as in their bodies, were utterly enraged like madmen
<a></a>against Pericles, and, like patients grown delirious, sought to lay
<a></a>violent hands on their physician, or, as it were, their father. They
<a></a>had been possessed, by his enemies, with the belief that the occasion
<a></a>of the plague was the crowding of the country people together into
<a></a>the town forced as they were now, in the heat of the summer-weather,
<a></a>to dwell many of them together even as they could, in small tenements
<a></a>and stifling hovels, and to be tied to a lazy course of life within
<a></a>doors, whereas before they lived in a pure, open, and free air. The
<a></a>cause and author of all this, said they, is he who on account of the
<a></a>war has poured a multitude of people in upon us within the walls,
<a></a>and uses all these men that he has here upon no employ or service,
<a></a>but keeps them pent up like cattle, to be overrun with infection from
<a></a>one another, affording them neither shift of quarters nor any refreshment.
<br><br><a></a>With the design to remedy these evils, and do the enemy some inconvenience,
<a></a>Pericles got a hundred and fifty galleys ready, and having embarked
<a></a>many tried soldiers, both foot and horse, was about to sail out, giving
<a></a>great hope to his citizens, and no less alarm to his enemies, upon
<a></a>the sight of so great a force. And now the vessels having their complement
<a></a>of men, and Pericles being gone aboard his own galley, it happened
<a></a>that the sun was eclipsed, and it grew dark on a sudden, to the affright
<a></a>of all, for this was looked upon as extremely ominous. Pericles, therefore,
<a></a>perceiving the steersman seized with fear and at a loss what to do,
<a></a>took his cloak and held it up before the man's face, and screening
<a></a>him with it so that he could not see, asked him whether he imagined
<a></a>there was any great hurt, or the sign of any great hurt in this, and
<a></a>he answering No, "Why," said he, "and what does that differ from this,
<a></a>only that what has caused that darkness there, is something greater
<a></a>than a cloak?" This is a story which philosophers tell their scholars.
<a></a>Pericles, however, after putting out to sea, seems not to have done
<a></a>any other exploit befitting such preparations, and when he had laid
<a></a>siege to the holy city Epidaurus, which gave him some hope of surrender,
<a></a>miscarried in his design by reason of the sickness. For it not only
<a></a>seized upon the Athenians, but upon all others, too, that held any
<a></a>sort of communication with the army. Finding after this the Athenians
<a></a>ill-affected and highly displeased with him, he tried and endeavoured
<a></a>what he could to appease and re-encourage them. But he could not pacify
<a></a>or allay their anger, nor persuade or prevail with them any way, till
<a></a>they freely passed their votes upon him, resumed their power, took
<a></a>away his command from him, and fined him in a sum of money; which
<a></a>by their account that say least, was fifteen talents, while they who
<a></a>reckon most, name fifty. The name prefixed to the accusation was Cleon,
<a></a>as Idomeneus tells us; Simmias, according to Theophrastus; and Heraclides
<a></a>Ponticus gives it as Lacratidas. 
<br><br><a></a>After this, public troubles were soon to leave him unmolested; the
<a></a>people, so to say, discharged their passion in their stroke, and lost
<a></a>their stings in the wound. But his domestic concerns were in an unhappy
<a></a>condition, many of his friends and acquaintance having died in the
<a></a>plague time, and those of his family having long since been in disorder
<a></a>and in a kind of mutiny against him. For the eldest of his lawfully
<a></a>begotten sons, Xanthippus by name, being naturally prodigal, and marrying
<a></a>a young and expensive wife, the daughter of Tisander, son of Epilycus,
<a></a>was highly offended at his father's economy in making him but a scanty
<a></a>allowance, by little and little at a time. He sent, therefore, to
<a></a>a friend one day and borrowed some money of him in his father Pericles's
<a></a>name, pretending it was by his order. The man coming afterward to
<a></a>demand the debt, Pericles was so far from yielding to pay it, that
<a></a>he entered an action against him. Upon which the young man, Xanthippus,
<a></a>thought himself so ill-used and disobliged that he openly reviled
<a></a>his father; telling first, by way of ridicule, stories about his conversations
<a></a>at home, and the discourses he had with the sophists and scholars
<a></a>that came to his house. As, for instance, how one who was a practicer
<a></a>of the five games of skill, having with a dart or javelin unawares
<a></a>against his will struck and killed Epitimus the Pharsalian, his father
<a></a>spent a whole day with Protagoras in a serious dispute, whether the
<a></a>javelin, or the man that threw it, or the masters of the games who
<a></a>appointed these sports, were, according to the strictest and best
<a></a>reason, to be accounted the cause of this mischance. Besides this,
<a></a>Stesimbrotus tells us that it was Xanthippus who spread abroad among
<a></a>the people the infamous story concerning his own wife; and in general
<a></a>that this difference of the young man's with his father, and the breach
<a></a>betwixt them, continued never to be healed or made up till his death.
<a></a>For Xanthippus died in the plague time of the sickness. At which time
<a></a>Pericles also lost his sister, and the greatest part of his relations
<a></a>and friends, and those who had been most useful and serviceable to
<a></a>him in managing the affairs of state. However, he did not shrink or
<a></a>give in upon these occasions, nor betray or lower his high spirit
<a></a>and the greatness of his mind under all his misfortunes; he was not
<a></a>even so much as seen to weep or to mourn, or even attend the burial
<a></a>of any of his friends or relations, till at last he lost his only
<a></a>remaining legitimate son. Subdued by this blow, and yet striving still,
<a></a>as far as he could, to maintain his principle, and to preserve and
<a></a>keep up the greatness of his soul, when he came, however, to perform
<a></a>the ceremony of putting a garland of flowers upon the head of the
<a></a>corpse, he was vanquished by his passion at the sight, so that he
<a></a>burst into exclamations, and shed copious tears, having never done
<a></a>any such thing in his life before. 
<br><br><a></a>The city having made trial of other generals for the conduct of war,
<a></a>and orators for business of state, when they found there was no one
<a></a>who was of weight enough for such a charge, or of authority sufficient
<a></a>to be trusted with so great a command regretted the loss of him, and
<a></a>invited him again to address and advise them, and to reassume the
<a></a>office of general. He, however, lay at home in dejection and mourning;
<a></a>but was persuaded by Alcibiades and others of his friends to come
<a></a>abroad and show himself to the people; who having, upon his appearance,
<a></a>made their acknowledgments, and apologized for their untowardly treatment
<a></a>of him he undertook the public affairs once more; and, being chosen
<a></a>general, requested that the statute concerning base-born children,
<a></a>which he himself had formerly caused to be made, might be suspended;
<a></a>that so the name and race of his family might not, for absolute want
<a></a>of a lawful heir to succeed, be wholly lost and extinguished. The
<a></a>case of the statute was thus: Pericles, when long ago at the height
<a></a>of his power in the state, having then, as has been said, children
<a></a>lawfully begotten, proposed a law that those only should be reputed
<a></a>true citizens of Athens who were born of such parents as were both
<a></a>Athenians. After this, the King of Egypt having sent to the people,
<a></a>by way of present, forty thousand bushels of wheat, which were to
<a></a>be shared out among the citizens, a great many actions and suits about
<a></a>legitimacy occurred, by virtue of that edict; cases which, till that
<a></a>time, had not been known nor taken notice of; and several persons
<a></a>suffered by false accusations. There were little less than five thousand
<a></a>who were convicted and sold for slaves; those who, enduring the test,
<a></a>remained in the government and passed muster for true Athenians were
<a></a>found upon the poll to be fourteen thousand and forty persons in number.
<br><br><a></a>It looked strange, that a law, which had been carried so far against
<a></a>so many people, should be cancelled again by the same man that made
<a></a>it; yet the present calamity and distress which Pericles laboured
<a></a>under in his family broke through all objections, and prevailed with
<a></a>the Athenians to pity him, as one whose losses and misfortunes had
<a></a>sufficiently punished his former arrogance and haughtiness. His sufferings
<a></a>deserved, they thought, their pity, and even indignation, and his
<a></a>request was such as became a man to ask and men to grant; they gave
<a></a>him permission to enrol his son in the register of his fraternity,
<a></a>giving him his own name. This son afterward, after having defeated
<a></a>the Peloponnesians at Arginusae, was, with his fellow-generals, put
<a></a>to death by the people. 
<br><br><a></a>About the time when his son was enrolled, it should seem the plague
<a></a>seized Pericles, not with sharp and violent fits, as it did others
<a></a>that had it, but with a dull and lingering distemper, attended with
<a></a>various changes and alterations, leisurely, by little and little,
<a></a>wasting the strength of his body, and undermining the noble faculties
<a></a>of his soul. So that Theophrastus, in his Morals, when discussing
<a></a>whether men's characters change with their circumstances, and their
<a></a>moral habits, disturbed by the ailings of their bodies, start aside
<a></a>from the rules of virtue, has left it upon record, that Pericles,
<a></a>when he was sick, showed one of his friends that came to visit him
<a></a>an amulet or charm that the women had hung about his neck; as much
<a></a>as to say, that he was very sick indeed when he would admit of such
<a></a>a foolery as that was. 
<br><br><a></a>When he was now near his end, the best of the citizens and those of
<a></a>his friends who were left alive, sitting about him, were speaking
<a></a>of the greatness of his merit, and his power, and reckoning up his
<a></a>famous actions and the number of his victories; for there were no
<a></a>less than nine trophies, which, as their chief commander and conqueror
<a></a>of their enemies, he had set up for the honour of the city. They talked
<a></a>thus together among themselves, as though he were unable to understand
<a></a>or mind what they said, but had now lost his consciousness. He had
<a></a>listened, however, all the while, and attended to all, and, speaking
<a></a>out among them, said that he wondered they should commend and take
<a></a>notice of things which were as much owing to fortune as to anything
<a></a>else, and had happened to many other commanders, and, at the same
<a></a>time, should not speak or make mention of that which was the most
<a></a>excellent and greatest thing of all. "For," said he, "no Athenian,
<a></a>through my means, ever wore mourning." 
<br><br><a></a>He was indeed a character deserving our high admiration not only for
<a></a>his equitable and mild temper, which all along in the many affairs
<a></a>of his life, and the great animosities which he incurred, he constantly
<a></a>maintained; but also for the high spirit and feeling which made him
<a></a>regard it, the noblest of all his honours that, in the exercise of
<a></a>such immense power, he never had gratified his envy or his passion,
<a></a>nor ever had treated any enemy as irreconcilably opposed to him. And
<a></a>to me it appears that this one thing gives that otherwise childish
<a></a>and arrogant title a fitting and becoming significance; so dispassionate
<a></a>a temper, a life so pure and unblemished, in the height of power and
<a></a>place, might well be called Olympian, in accordance with our conceptions
<a></a>of the divine beings, to whom, as the natural authors of all good
<a></a>and of nothing evil, we ascribe the rule and government of the world.
<a></a>Not as the poets represent, who, while confounding us with their ignorant
<a></a>fancies, are themselves confuted by their own poems and fictions,
<a></a>and call the place, indeed, where they say the gods make their abode,
<a></a>a secure and quiet seat, free from all hazards and commotions, untroubled
<a></a>with winds or with clouds, and equally through all time illumined
<a></a>with a soft serenity and a pure light as though such were a home most
<a></a>agreeable for a blessed and immortal nature; and yet, in the meanwhile,
<a></a>affirm that the gods themselves are full of trouble and enmity and
<a></a>anger and other passions, which no way become or belong to even men
<a></a>that have any understanding. But this will, perhaps seem a subject
<a></a>fitter for some other consideration, and that ought to be treated
<a></a>of in some other place. 
<br><br><a></a>The course of public affairs after his death produced a quick and
<a></a>speedy sense of the loss of Pericles. Those who, while he lived, resented
<a></a>his great authority, as that which eclipsed themselves, presently
<a></a>after his quitting the stage, making trial of other orators and demagogues,
<a></a>readily acknowledged that there never had been in nature such a disposition
<a></a>as his was, more moderate and reasonable in the height of that state
<a></a>he took upon him, or more grave and impressive in the mildness which
<a></a>he used. And that invidious arbitrary power, to which formerly they
<a></a>gave the name of monarchy and tyranny, did then appear to have been
<a></a>the chief bulwark of public safety; so great a corruption and such
<a></a>a flood of mischief and vice followed which he, by keeping weak and
<a></a>low, had withheld from notice, and had prevented from attaining incurable
<a></a>height through a licentious impunity.
