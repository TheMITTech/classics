<A NAME="2"></A><BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>IN the comparison of these two, first, if we compare the estate of Nicias 
<A NAME="11"></A>with that of Crassus, we must acknowledge Nicias's to have been more honestly 
<A NAME="12"></A>got. In itself, indeed, one cannot much approve of gaining riches by working 
<A NAME="13"></A>mines, the greatest part of which is done by malefactors and barbarians, 
<A NAME="14"></A>some of them, too, bound, and perishing in those close and unwholesome 
<A NAME="15"></A>places. But if we compare this with the sequestrations of Sylla, and the 
<A NAME="16"></A>contracts for houses ruined by fire, we shall then think Nicias came very 
<A NAME="17"></A>honestly by his money. For Crassus publicly and avowedly made use of these 
<A NAME="18"></A>arts, as other men do of husbandry, and putting out money to interest; 
<A NAME="19"></A>while as for other matters which he used to deny, when taxed with them, 
<A NAME="20"></A>as, namely, selling his voice in the senate for gain's sake, and injuring 
<A NAME="21"></A>allies, and courting women, and conniving at criminals, these are things 
<A NAME="22"></A>which Nicias was never so much as falsely accused of; nay, he was rather 
<A NAME="23"></A>laughed at for giving money to those who made a trade of impeachments, 
<A NAME="24"></A>merely out of timorousness, a course, indeed, that would by no means become 
<A NAME="25"></A>Pericles and Aristides, but necessary for him who by nature was wanting 
<A NAME="26"></A>in assurance, even as Lycurgus, the orator, frankly acknowledged to the 
<A NAME="27"></A>people; for when he was accused for buying off an evidence, he said that 
<A NAME="28"></A>he was very much pleased that, having administered their affairs for so 
<A NAME="29"></A>long a time; he was at last accused, rather for giving than receiving. 
<A NAME="30"></A>Again, Nicias, in his expenses, was a more public spirit than Crassus, 
<A NAME="31"></A>priding himself much on the dedication of gifts in temples, on presiding 
<A NAME="32"></A>at gymnastic games, and furnishing choruses for the plays, and adorning 
<A NAME="33"></A>processions, while the expenses of Crassus, in feasting and afterwards 
<A NAME="34"></A>providing food for so many myriads of people, were much greater than all 
<A NAME="35"></A>that Nicias possessed as well as spent put together. So that one might 
<A NAME="36"></A>wonder at any one's failing to see that vice is a certain inconsistency 
<A NAME="37"></A>and incongruity of habit, after such an example of money dishonourably 
<A NAME="38"></A>obtained and wastefully lavished away.
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR>Let so much be said of their estates; as for their management of 
<A NAME="40"></A>public affairs, I see not that any dishonesty, injustice, or arbitrary 
<A NAME="41"></A>action can be objected to Nicias, who was rather the victim of Alcibiades's 
<A NAME="42"></A>tricks, and was always careful and scrupulous in his dealings with the 
<A NAME="43"></A>people. But Crassus is very generally blamed for his changeableness in 
<A NAME="44"></A>his friendships and enmities, for his unfaithfulness, and his mean and 
<A NAME="45"></A>underhand proceedings; since he himself could not deny that to compass 
<A NAME="46"></A>the consulship he hired men to lay violent hands upon Domitius and Cato. 
<A NAME="47"></A>Then at the assembly held for assigning the provinces, many were wounded 
<A NAME="48"></A>and four actually killed, and he himself, which I had omitted in the narrative 
<A NAME="49"></A>of his life, struck with his fist one Lucius Analius, a senator, for contradicting 
<A NAME="50"></A>him, so that he left the place bleeding. But as Crassus was to be blamed 
<A NAME="51"></A>for his violent and arbitrary courses, so is Nicias no less to be blamed 
<A NAME="52"></A>for his timorousness and meanness of spirit, which made him submit and 
<A NAME="53"></A>give in to the basest people, whereas in this respect Crassus showed himself 
<A NAME="54"></A>lofty-spirited and magnanimous, who having to do not with such as Cleon 
<A NAME="55"></A>or Hyperbolus, but with the splendid acts of Caesar and the three triumphs 
<A NAME="56"></A>of Pompey, would not stoop, but bravely bore up against their joint interests, 
<A NAME="57"></A>and in obtaining the office of censor, surpassed even Pompey himself. For 
<A NAME="58"></A>a statesman ought not to regard how invidious the thing is, but how noble, 
<A NAME="59"></A>and by his greatness to overpower envy; but if he will be always aiming 
<A NAME="60"></A>at security and quiet, and dread Alcibiades upon the hustings, and the 
<A NAME="61"></A>Lacedaemonians at Pylos, and Perdiccas in Thrace, there is room and opportunity 
<A NAME="62"></A>enough for retirement, and he may sit out of the noise of business, and 
<A NAME="63"></A>weave himself, as one of the sophists says, his triumphal garland of inactivity. 
<A NAME="64"></A>His desire of peace, indeed, and of finishing the war was a divine and 
<A NAME="65"></A>truly Grecian ambition, nor in this respect would Crassus deserve to be 
<A NAME="66"></A>compared to him, though he had enlarged the Roman empire to the Caspian 
<A NAME="67"></A>Sea or the Indian Ocean.
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR>In a state where there is a sense of virtue, a powerful man ought 
<A NAME="69"></A>not to give way to the ill-affected, or expose the government to those 
<A NAME="70"></A>that are incapable of it, nor suffer high trusts to be committed to those 
<A NAME="71"></A>who want common honesty. Yet Nicias, by his connivance, raised Cleon, a 
<A NAME="72"></A>fellow remarkable for nothing but his loud voice and brazen face, to the 
<A NAME="73"></A>command of an army. Indeed, I do not commend Crassus, who in the war with 
<A NAME="74"></A>Spartacus was more forward to fight than became a discreet general, though 
<A NAME="75"></A>he was urged into it by a point of honour, lest Pompey by his coming should 
<A NAME="76"></A>rob him of the glory of the action, as Mummius did Metellus at the taking 
<A NAME="77"></A>of Corinth, but Nicias's proceedings are inexcusable. For he did not yield 
<A NAME="78"></A>up a mere opportunity of getting honour and advantage to his competitor, 
<A NAME="79"></A>but believing that the expedition would be very hazardous, was thankful 
<A NAME="80"></A>to take care of himself, and left the commonwealth to shift for itself. 
<A NAME="81"></A>And whereas Themistocles, lest a mean and incapable fellow should ruin 
<A NAME="82"></A>the state by holding command in the Persian war, bought him off, and Cato, 
<A NAME="83"></A>in a most dangerous and critical conjuncture, stood for the tribuneship 
<A NAME="84"></A>for the sake of his country, Nicias, reserving himself for trifling expeditions 
<A NAME="85"></A>against Minoa and Cythera, and the miserable Melians, if there be occasion 
<A NAME="86"></A>to come to blows with the Lacedaemonians, slips off his general's cloak 
<A NAME="87"></A>and hands over to the unskillfulness and rashness of Cleon, fleet, men, 
<A NAME="88"></A>and arms, and the whole command, where the utmost possible skill was called 
<A NAME="89"></A>for. Such conduct, I say, is not to be thought so much carelessness of 
<A NAME="90"></A>his own fame, as of the interest and preservation of his country. By this 
<A NAME="91"></A>means it came to pass he was compelled to the Sicilian war, men generally 
<A NAME="92"></A>believing that he was so much honestly convinced of the difficulty of the 
<A NAME="93"></A>enterprise, as ready out of mere love of ease and cowardice to lose the 
<A NAME="94"></A>city the conquest of Sicily. But yet it is a great sign of his integrity, 
<A NAME="95"></A>that though he was always averse from war, and unwilling to command, yet 
<A NAME="96"></A>they always continued to appoint him as the best experienced and ablest 
<A NAME="97"></A>general they had. On the other hand Crassus, though always ambitious of 
<A NAME="98"></A>command, never attained to it, except by mere necessity in the servile 
<A NAME="99"></A>war, Pompey and Metellus and the two brothers Lucullus being absent, although 
<A NAME="100"></A>at that time he was at his highest pitch of interest and reputation. Even 
<A NAME="101"></A>those who thought most of him seem to have thought him, as the comic poet 
<A NAME="102"></A>says-
<A NAME="103"></A><BR><BR>"A brave man anywhere but in the field." There was no help, however, 
<A NAME="104"></A>for the Romans, against his passion for command and for distinction. The 
<A NAME="105"></A>Athenians sent out Nicias against his will to the war, and Crassus led 
<A NAME="106"></A>out the Romans against theirs; Crassus brought misfortune on Rome, as Athens 
<A NAME="107"></A>brought it on Nicias.
<A NAME="108"></A><BR><BR>Still this is rather ground for praising Nicias, than for finding 
<A NAME="109"></A>fault with Crassus. His experience and sound judgment as a general saved 
<A NAME="110"></A>him from being carried away by the delusive hopes of his fellow-citizens, 
<A NAME="111"></A>and made him refuse to entertain any prospect of conquering Sicily. Crassus, 
<A NAME="112"></A>on the other hand, mistook, in entering on a Parthian war as an easy matter. 
<A NAME="113"></A>He was eager, while Caesar was subduing the west, Gaul, Germany, and Britain, 
<A NAME="114"></A>to advance for his part to the east and the Indian Sea, by the conquest 
<A NAME="115"></A>of Asia, to complete the incursion of Pompey and the attempts of Lucullus, 
<A NAME="116"></A>men of prudent temper and of unimpeachable worth, who nevertheless entertained 
<A NAME="117"></A>the same projects as Crassus, and acted under the same convictions. When 
<A NAME="118"></A>Pompey was appointed to the like command, the senate was opposed to it; 
<A NAME="119"></A>and after Caesar had routed three hundred thousand Germans, Cato recommended 
<A NAME="120"></A>that he should be surrendered to the defeated enemy, to expiate in his 
<A NAME="121"></A>own person the guilt of breach of faith. The people, meantime (their service 
<A NAME="122"></A>to Cato!), kept holiday for fifteen days, and were overjoyed. What would 
<A NAME="123"></A>have been their feelings, and how many holidays would they have celebrated, 
<A NAME="124"></A>if Crassus had sent news from Babylon of victory, and thence marching onward 
<A NAME="125"></A>had converted Media and Persia, the Hyrcanians, Susa and Bactra, into Roman 
<A NAME="126"></A>provinces?
<A NAME="127"></A><BR><BR>If wrong we must do, as Euripides says, and cannot be content with 
<A NAME="128"></A>peace and present good things, let it not be for such results as destroying 
<A NAME="129"></A>Mende or Scandea, or beating up the exiled Aeginetans in the coverts to 
<A NAME="130"></A>which like hunted birds they had fled, when expelled from their homes, 
<A NAME="131"></A>but let it be for some really great remuneration: nor let us part with 
<A NAME="132"></A>justice, like a cheap and common thing, for a small and trifling price. 
<A NAME="133"></A>Those who praise Alexander's enterprise and blame that of Crassus, judge 
<A NAME="134"></A>of the beginning unfairly by the results.
<A NAME="135"></A><BR><BR>In actual service, Nicias did much that deserves high praise. He 
<A NAME="136"></A>frequently defeated the enemy in battle, and was on the very point of capturing 
<A NAME="137"></A>Syracuse; nor should he bear the whole blame of the disaster, which may 
<A NAME="138"></A>fairly be ascribed in part to his want of health and to the jealousy entertained 
<A NAME="139"></A>of him at home. Crassus, on the other hand, committed so many errors as 
<A NAME="140"></A>not to leave fortune room to show him favour. It is no surprise to find 
<A NAME="141"></A>such imbecility fall a victim to the power of Parthia; the only wonder 
<A NAME="142"></A>is to see it prevailing over the wonted good fortune of Rome. One scrupulously 
<A NAME="143"></A>observed, the other entirely slighted the arts of divination: and as both 
<A NAME="144"></A>equally perished, it is difficult to see what inference we should draw. 
<A NAME="145"></A>Yet the fault of over-caution, supported by old and general opinion, better 
<A NAME="146"></A>deserves forgiveness than that of self-willed and lawless 
<A NAME="147"></A>transgression.
<A NAME="148"></A><BR><BR>In his death, however, Crassus had the advantage, as he did not 
<A NAME="149"></A>surrender himself, nor submit to bondage, nor let himself be taken in by 
<A NAME="150"></A>trickery, but was the victim only of the entreaties of his friends and 
<A NAME="151"></A>the perfidy of his enemies; whereas Nicias enhanced the shame of his death 
<A NAME="152"></A>by yielding himself up in the hope of disgraceful and inglorious 
<A NAME="153"></A>escape.
