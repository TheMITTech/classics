<A NAME="2"></A>
<BR>(legendary, died 353 B.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>IF it be true, Sosius Senecio, that, as Simonides tells 
<A NAME="11"></A>us-
<A NAME="12"></A><BR><BR>"Of the Corinthians Troy does not complain" for having taken part 
<A NAME="13"></A>with the Achaeans in the siege, because the Trojans also had Corinthians 
<A NAME="14"></A>(Glaucus, who sprang from Corinth) fighting bravely on their side, so also 
<A NAME="15"></A>it may be fairly said that neither Romans nor Greeks can quarrel with the 
<A NAME="16"></A>Academy, each nation being equally represented in the following pair of 
<A NAME="17"></A>lives, which will give an account of Brutus and of Dion,- Dion, who was 
<A NAME="18"></A>Plato's own hearer, and Brutus, who was brought up in his philosophy. They 
<A NAME="19"></A>came from one and the self-same school, where they had been trained alike 
<A NAME="20"></A>to run the race of honour; nor need we wonder that in the performance of 
<A NAME="21"></A>actions often most nearly allied and akin, they both bore evidence to the 
<A NAME="22"></A>truth of what their guide and teacher said, that, without the concurrence 
<A NAME="23"></A>of power and success, with justice and prudence, public actions do not 
<A NAME="24"></A>attain their proper, great, and noble character. For as Hippomachus the 
<A NAME="25"></A>wrestling-master affirmed, he could distinguish his scholars at a distance, 
<A NAME="26"></A>though they were but carrying meat from the shambles, so it is very probable 
<A NAME="27"></A>that the principles of those who have had the same good education should 
<A NAME="28"></A>appear with a resemblance in all their actions, creating in them a certain 
<A NAME="29"></A>harmony and proportion, at once agreeable and becoming.
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>We may also draw a close parallel of the lives of the two men from 
<A NAME="31"></A>their fortunes, wherein chance, even more than their own designs, made 
<A NAME="32"></A>them nearly alike. For they were both cut off by an untimely death, not 
<A NAME="33"></A>being able to accomplish those ends which through many risks and difficulties 
<A NAME="34"></A>they aimed at. But, above all, this is most wonderful; that by preternatural 
<A NAME="35"></A>interposition both of them had notice given of their approaching death 
<A NAME="36"></A>by an unpropitious form, which visibly appeared to them. Although there 
<A NAME="37"></A>are people who utterly deny any such thing, and say that no man in his 
<A NAME="38"></A>right senses ever yet saw any supernatural phantom or apparition, but that 
<A NAME="39"></A>children only, and silly women, or men disordered by sickness, in some 
<A NAME="40"></A>aberration of the mind or distemperature of the body, have had empty and 
<A NAME="41"></A>extravagant imaginations, whilst the real evil genius, superstition, was 
<A NAME="42"></A>in themselves. Yet if Dion and Brutus' men of solid understanding, and 
<A NAME="43"></A>philosophers, not to be easily deluded by fancy or discomposed by any sudden 
<A NAME="44"></A>apprehension, were thus affected by visions that they forthwith declared 
<A NAME="45"></A>to their friends what they had seen, I know not how we can avoid admitting 
<A NAME="46"></A>again the utterly exploded opinion of the oldest times, that evil and beguiling 
<A NAME="47"></A>spirits, out of envy to good men, and a desire of impeding their good deeds, 
<A NAME="48"></A>make efforts to excite in them feelings of terror and distraction, to make 
<A NAME="49"></A>them shake and totter in their virtue, lest by a steady and unbiased perseverance 
<A NAME="50"></A>they should obtain a happier condition than these beings after death. But 
<A NAME="51"></A>I shall leave these things for another opportunity, and in this twelfth 
<A NAME="52"></A>book of the lives of great men compared one with another, begin with his 
<A NAME="53"></A>who was the elder.
<A NAME="54"></A><BR><BR>Dionysius the First, having possessed himself of the government, 
<A NAME="55"></A>at once took to wife the daughter of Hermocrates, the Syracusan. She, in 
<A NAME="56"></A>an outbreak which the citizens made before the new power was well settled, 
<A NAME="57"></A>was abused in such a barbarous and outrageous manner that for shame she 
<A NAME="58"></A>put an end to her own life. But Dionysius, when he was re-established and 
<A NAME="59"></A>confirmed in his supremacy, married two wives together, one named Doris, 
<A NAME="60"></A>of Locri, the other Aristomache, a native of Sicily, and daughter of Hipparinus, 
<A NAME="61"></A>a man of the first quality in Syracuse, and colleague with Dionysius when 
<A NAME="62"></A>he was first chosen general with unlimited powers for the war. It is said 
<A NAME="63"></A>he married them both in one day, and no one ever knew which of the two 
<A NAME="64"></A>he first made his wife; and ever after he divided his kindness equally 
<A NAME="65"></A>between them, both accompanying him together at his table, and in his bed 
<A NAME="66"></A>by turns. Indeed, the Syracusans were urgent that their own countrywoman 
<A NAME="67"></A>might be preferred before the stranger; but Doris, to compensate her for 
<A NAME="68"></A>her foreign extraction, had the good fortune to be the mother of the son 
<A NAME="69"></A>and heir of the family, whilst Aristomache continued a long time without 
<A NAME="70"></A>issue, though Dionysius was very desirous to have children by her, and, 
<A NAME="71"></A>indeed, caused Doris's mother to be put to death, laying to her charge 
<A NAME="72"></A>that she had given drugs to Aristomache to prevent her being with 
<A NAME="73"></A>child.
<A NAME="74"></A><BR><BR>Dion, Aristomache's brother, at first found an honourable reception 
<A NAME="75"></A>for his sister's sake; but his own worth and parts soon procured him a 
<A NAME="76"></A>nearer place in his brother-in-law's affection, who, among other favours, 
<A NAME="77"></A>gave special command to his treasurers to furnish Dion with whatever money 
<A NAME="78"></A>he demanded, only telling him on the same day what they had delivered out. 
<A NAME="79"></A>Now, though Dion was before reputed a person of lofty character, of a noble 
<A NAME="80"></A>mind, and daring courage, yet these excellent qualifications all received 
<A NAME="81"></A>a great development from the happy chance which conducted Plato into Sicily; 
<A NAME="82"></A>not assuredly by any human device or calculation, but some supernatural 
<A NAME="83"></A>power, designing that this remote cause should hereafter occasion the recovery 
<A NAME="84"></A>of the Sicilians' lost liberty and the subversion of the tyrannical government, 
<A NAME="85"></A>brought the philosopher out of Italy to Syracuse, and made acquaintance 
<A NAME="86"></A>between him and Dion. Dion was, indeed, at this time extremely young in 
<A NAME="87"></A>years, but of all the scholars that attended Plato he was the quickest 
<A NAME="88"></A>and aptest to learn, and the most prompt and eager to practise, the lessons 
<A NAME="89"></A>of virtue, as Plato himself reports of him and his own actions sufficiently 
<A NAME="90"></A>testify. For though he had been bred up under a tyrant in habits of submission, 
<A NAME="91"></A>accustomed to a life on the one hand of servility and intimidation, and 
<A NAME="92"></A>yet on the other of vulgar display and luxury, the mistaken happiness of 
<A NAME="93"></A>people that knew no better thing than pleasure and self-indulgence, yet, 
<A NAME="94"></A>at the first taste of reason and a philosophy that demands obedience to 
<A NAME="95"></A>virtue, his soul was set in a flame, and in the simple innocence of youth, 
<A NAME="96"></A>concluding, from his own disposition, that the same reason would work the 
<A NAME="97"></A>same effects upon Dionysius, he made it his business, and at length obtained 
<A NAME="98"></A>the favour of him, at a leisure hour, to hear Plato.
<A NAME="99"></A><BR><BR>At this their meeting, the subject-matter of their discourse in 
<A NAME="100"></A>general was human virtue, but, more particularly, they disputed concerning 
<A NAME="101"></A>fortitude, which Plato proved tyrants, of all men, had the least pretence 
<A NAME="102"></A>to; and thence proceeding to treat of justice, asserted the happy estate 
<A NAME="103"></A>of the just and the miserable condition of the unjust; arguments which 
<A NAME="104"></A>Dionysius would not hear out, but, feeling himself, as it were, convicted 
<A NAME="105"></A>by his words, and much displeased to see the rest of the auditors full 
<A NAME="106"></A>of admiration for the speaker and captivated with his doctrine, at last, 
<A NAME="107"></A>exceedingly exasperated, he asked the philosopher in a rage, what business 
<A NAME="108"></A>he had in Sicily. To which Plato answered, "I came to seek a virtuous man." 
<A NAME="109"></A>"It seems, then," replied Dionysius, "you have lost your labour." Dion, 
<A NAME="110"></A>supposing that this was all, and that nothing further could come of his 
<A NAME="111"></A>anger, at Plato's request, conveyed him aboard a galley, which was conveying 
<A NAME="112"></A>Pollis, the Spartan, into Greece. But Dionysius privately dealt with Pollis, 
<A NAME="113"></A>by all means to kill Plato in the voyage; if not, to be sure to sell him 
<A NAME="114"></A>for a slave: he would, of course, take no harm of it, being the same just 
<A NAME="115"></A>man as before; he would enjoy that happiness, though he lost his liberty. 
<A NAME="116"></A>Pollis, therefore, it is stated, carried Plato to Aegina, and there sold 
<A NAME="117"></A>him; the, Aeginetans, then at war with Athens, having made a decree that 
<A NAME="118"></A>whatever Athenian was taken on their coasts should forthwith be exposed 
<A NAME="119"></A>to sale. Notwithstanding, Dion was not in less favour and credit with Dionysius 
<A NAME="120"></A>than formerly, but was intrusted with the most considerable employments, 
<A NAME="121"></A>and sent on important embassies to Carthage, in the management of which 
<A NAME="122"></A>he gained very great reputation. Besides, the usurper bore with the liberty 
<A NAME="123"></A>he took to speak his mind freely, he being the only man who, upon any occasion, 
<A NAME="124"></A>durst boldly say what he thought, as, for example, in the rebuke he gave 
<A NAME="125"></A>him about Gelon. Dionysius was ridiculing Gelon's government, and, alluding 
<A NAME="126"></A>to his name, said he had been the laughingstock of Sicily. While others 
<A NAME="127"></A>seemed to admire and applaud the quibble, Dion very warmly replied, "Nevertheless, 
<A NAME="128"></A>it is certain that you are sole governor here, because you were trusted 
<A NAME="129"></A>for Gelon's sake; but for your sake no man will ever hereafter be trusted 
<A NAME="130"></A>again." For, indeed, Gelon had made a monarchy appear the best, whereas 
<A NAME="131"></A>Dionysius had convinced men that it was the worst of 
<A NAME="132"></A>governments.
<A NAME="133"></A><BR><BR>Dionysius had three children by Doris, and by Aristomache four, 
<A NAME="134"></A>two of which were daughters, Sophrosyne and Arete. Sophrosyne was married 
<A NAME="135"></A>to his son Dionysius; Arete, to his brother Thearides, after whose death 
<A NAME="136"></A>Dion received his niece Arete to wife. Now when Dionysius was sick and 
<A NAME="137"></A>like to die, Dion endeavoured to speak with him in behalf of the children 
<A NAME="138"></A>he had by Aristomache, but was still prevented by the physicians, who wanted 
<A NAME="139"></A>to ingratiate themselves with the next successor, who also, as Timaeus 
<A NAME="140"></A>reports, gave him a sleeping potion which he asked for, which produced 
<A NAME="141"></A>an insensibility only followed by his death.
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR>Nevertheless, at the first council which the young Dionysius held 
<A NAME="143"></A>with his friends, Dion discoursed so well of the present state of affairs 
<A NAME="144"></A>that he made all the rest appear in their politics but children, and in 
<A NAME="145"></A>their votes rather slaves than counsellors, who timorously and disingenuously 
<A NAME="146"></A>advised what would please the young man, rather than what would advance 
<A NAME="147"></A>his interest. But that which startled them most was the proposal he made 
<A NAME="148"></A>to avert the imminent danger they feared of a war with the Carthaginians, 
<A NAME="149"></A>undertaking, if Dionysius wanted peace, to sail immediately over into Africa, 
<A NAME="150"></A>and conclude it there upon honourable terms; but, if he rather preferred 
<A NAME="151"></A>war, then he would fit out and maintain at his own cost and charges fifty 
<A NAME="152"></A>galleys ready for the service.
<A NAME="153"></A><BR><BR>Dionysius wondered much at his greatness of mind, and received 
<A NAME="154"></A>his offer with satisfaction. But the other courtiers, thinking his generosity 
<A NAME="155"></A>reflected upon them, and jealous of being lessened by his greatness, from 
<A NAME="156"></A>hence took all occasions by private slanders to render him obnoxious to 
<A NAME="157"></A>the young man's displeasure; as if he designed, by his power at sea, to 
<A NAME="158"></A>surprise the government, and by the help of those naval forces confer the 
<A NAME="159"></A>supreme authority upon his sister Aristomache's children. But, indeed, 
<A NAME="160"></A>the most apparent and the strongest grounds for dislike and hostility existed 
<A NAME="161"></A>already in the difference of his habits, and his reserved and separate 
<A NAME="162"></A>way of living. For they, who, from the beginning by flatteries and all 
<A NAME="163"></A>unworthy artifices, courted the favour and familiarity of the prince, youthful 
<A NAME="164"></A>and voluptuously bred, ministered to his pleasures, and sought how to find 
<A NAME="165"></A>him daily some new amours and occupy him in vain amusements, with wine 
<A NAME="166"></A>or with women, and in other dissipations; by which means, the tyranny, 
<A NAME="167"></A>like iron softened in the fire, seemed, indeed, to the subject, to be more 
<A NAME="168"></A>moderate and gentle, and to abate somewhat of its extreme severity; the 
<A NAME="169"></A>edge of it being blunted, not by the clemency, but rather the sloth and 
<A NAME="170"></A>degeneracy of the sovereign, whose dissoluteness, gaining ground daily, 
<A NAME="171"></A>and growing upon him, soon weakened and broke those "adamantine chains," 
<A NAME="172"></A>with which his father, Dionysius, said he had left the monarchy fastened 
<A NAME="173"></A>and secured. It is reported of him that, having begun a drunken debauch, 
<A NAME="174"></A>he continued it ninety days without intermission; in all which time no 
<A NAME="175"></A>person on business was allowed to appear, nor was any serious conversation 
<A NAME="176"></A>heard at court, but drinking, singing, dancing, and buffoonery reigned 
<A NAME="177"></A>there without control.
<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR>It is likely then they had little kindness for Dion, who never 
<A NAME="179"></A>indulged himself in any youthful pleasure or diversion. And so his very 
<A NAME="180"></A>virtues were the matter of their calumnies, and were represented under 
<A NAME="181"></A>one or other plausible name as vices; they called his gravity pride, his 
<A NAME="182"></A>plain-dealing self-will, the good advice he gave was all construed into 
<A NAME="183"></A>reprimand, and he was censured for neglecting and scorning those in whose 
<A NAME="184"></A>misdemeanours he declined to participate. And to say the truth, there was 
<A NAME="185"></A>in his natural character something stately, austere, reserved, and unsociable 
<A NAME="186"></A>in conversation, which made his company unpleasant and disagreeable not 
<A NAME="187"></A>only to the young tyrant, whose ears had been corrupted by flatteries; 
<A NAME="188"></A>many also of Dion's own intimate friends, though they loved the integrity 
<A NAME="189"></A>and generosity of his temper, yet blamed his manner, and thought he treated 
<A NAME="190"></A>those with whom he had to do less courteously and affably than became a 
<A NAME="191"></A>man engaged in civil business. Of which Plato also afterwards wrote to 
<A NAME="192"></A>him; and, as it were, prophetically advised him carefully to avoid an arbitrary 
<A NAME="193"></A>temper, whose proper helpmate was a solitary life. And, indeed, at this 
<A NAME="194"></A>very time, though circumstances made him so important, and in the danger 
<A NAME="195"></A>of the tottering government he was recognized as the only or the ablest 
<A NAME="196"></A>support of it, yet he well understood that he owed not his high position 
<A NAME="197"></A>to any good-will or kindness, but to the mere necessities of the 
<A NAME="198"></A>usurper.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR>And, supposing the cause of this to be ignorance and want of education, 
<A NAME="200"></A>he endeavoured to induce the young man into a course of liberal studies, 
<A NAME="201"></A>and to give him some knowledge of moral truths and reasonings, hoping he 
<A NAME="202"></A>might thus lose his fear of virtuous living, and learn to take pleasure 
<A NAME="203"></A>in laudable actions. Dionysius, in his own nature, was not one of the worst 
<A NAME="204"></A>kind of tyrants, but his father, fearing that if he should come to understand 
<A NAME="205"></A>himself better, and converse with wise and reasonable men, he might enter 
<A NAME="206"></A>into some design against him, and dispossess him of his power, kept him 
<A NAME="207"></A>closely shut up at home; where, for want of other company, and ignorant 
<A NAME="208"></A>how to spend his time better, he busied himself in making little chariots, 
<A NAME="209"></A>candlesticks, stools, tables, and other things of wood. For the elder Dionysius 
<A NAME="210"></A>was so diffident and suspicious, and so continually on his guard against 
<A NAME="211"></A>all men, that he would not so much as let his hair be trimmed with any 
<A NAME="212"></A>barber's or haircutter's instruments, but made one of his artificers singe 
<A NAME="213"></A>him with a live coal. Neither were his brother or his son allowed to come 
<A NAME="214"></A>into his apartment in the dress they wore, but they, as all others, were 
<A NAME="215"></A>stript to their skins by some of the guard, and, after being seen naked, 
<A NAME="216"></A>put on other clothes before they were admitted into the presence. When 
<A NAME="217"></A>his brother Leptines was once describing the situation of a place, and 
<A NAME="218"></A>took a javelin from one of the guard to draw the plan of it, he was extremely 
<A NAME="219"></A>angry with him, and had the soldier who gave him the weapon put to death. 
<A NAME="220"></A>He declared the more judicious his friends were the more he suspected them; 
<A NAME="221"></A>because he knew that, were it in their choice, they would rather be tyrants 
<A NAME="222"></A>themselves than the subjects of a tyrant. He slew Marsyas, one of his captains 
<A NAME="223"></A>whom he had preferred to a considerable command, for dreaming that he killed 
<A NAME="224"></A>him: without some previous waking thought and purpose of the kind, he could 
<A NAME="225"></A>not, he supposed, have had that fancy in his sleep. So timorous was he, 
<A NAME="226"></A>and so miserable a slave to his fears, yet very angry with Plato, because 
<A NAME="227"></A>he would not allow him to be the valiantest man alive.
<A NAME="228"></A><BR><BR>Dion, as we said before, seeing the son thus deformed and spoilt 
<A NAME="229"></A>in character for want of teaching, exhorted him to study, and to use all 
<A NAME="230"></A>his entreaties to persuade Plato, the first of philosophers, to visit him 
<A NAME="231"></A>in Sicily, and when he came, to submit himself to his direction and advice; 
<A NAME="232"></A>by whose instructions he might conform his nature to the truths of virtue, 
<A NAME="233"></A>and, living after the likeness of the Divine and glorious Model of Being, 
<A NAME="234"></A>out of obedience to whose control the general confusion is changed into 
<A NAME="235"></A>the beautiful order of the universe, so he in like manner might be the 
<A NAME="236"></A>cause of great happiness to himself and to all his subjects, who, obliged 
<A NAME="237"></A>by his justice and moderation, would then willingly pay him obedience as 
<A NAME="238"></A>their father, which now grudgingly, and upon necessity, they are forced 
<A NAME="239"></A>to yield him as their master. Their usurping tyrant he would then no longer 
<A NAME="240"></A>be, but their lawful king. For fear and force, a great navy and standing 
<A NAME="241"></A>army of ten thousand hired barbarians are not, as his father had said, 
<A NAME="242"></A>the adamantine chains which secure the regal power, but the love, zeal, 
<A NAME="243"></A>and affection inspired by clemency and justice; which, though they seem 
<A NAME="244"></A>more pliant than the stiff and hard bonds of severity, are nevertheless 
<A NAME="245"></A>the strongest and most durable ties to sustain a lasting government. Moreover, 
<A NAME="246"></A>it is mean and dishonourable that a ruler, while careful to be splendid 
<A NAME="247"></A>in his dress, and luxurious and magnificent in his habitation, should, 
<A NAME="248"></A>in reason and power of speech, make no better show than the commonest of 
<A NAME="249"></A>his subjects, nor have the princely palace of his mind adorned according 
<A NAME="250"></A>to his royal dignity.
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR>Dion frequently entertaining the king upon this subject, and, as 
<A NAME="252"></A>occasion offered, repeating some of the philosopher's sayings, Dionysius 
<A NAME="253"></A>grew impatiently desirous to have Plato's company, and to hear him discourse. 
<A NAME="254"></A>Forthwith, therefore, he sent letter upon letter to him to Athens, to which 
<A NAME="255"></A>Dion added his entreaties; also several philosophers of the Pythagorean 
<A NAME="256"></A>sect from Italy sent their recommendations, urging him to come and obtain 
<A NAME="257"></A>a hold upon this pliant, youthful soul, which his solid and weighty reasonings 
<A NAME="258"></A>might steady, as it were, upon the seas of absolute power and authority. 
<A NAME="259"></A>Plato, as he tells us himself, out of shame more than any other feeling, 
<A NAME="260"></A>lest it should seem that he was all mere theory, and that of his own good-will 
<A NAME="261"></A>he would never venture into action, hoping withal, that if he could work 
<A NAME="262"></A>a cure upon one man, the head and guide of the rest, he might remedy the 
<A NAME="263"></A>distempers of the whole island of Sicily, yielded to their 
<A NAME="264"></A>requests.
<A NAME="265"></A><BR><BR>But Dion's enemies, fearing an alteration in Dionysius, persuaded 
<A NAME="266"></A>him to recall from banishment Philistus, a man of learned education, and 
<A NAME="267"></A>at the same time of great experience in the ways of tyrants, and who might 
<A NAME="268"></A>serve as a counterpoise to Plato and his philosophy. For Philistus from 
<A NAME="269"></A>the beginning had been a great instrument in establishing the tyranny, 
<A NAME="270"></A>and for a long time had held the office of captain of the citadel. There 
<A NAME="271"></A>was a report that he had been intimate with the mother of Dionysius the 
<A NAME="272"></A>first, and not without his privity. And when Leptines, having two daughters 
<A NAME="273"></A>by a married woman who he had debauched, gave one of them in marriage to 
<A NAME="274"></A>Philistus, without acquainting Dionysius, he, in great anger, put Leptines's 
<A NAME="275"></A>mistress in prison, and banished Philistus from Sicily. Whereupon, he fled 
<A NAME="276"></A>to some of his friends on the Adriatic coast, in which retirement and leisure 
<A NAME="277"></A>it is probable he wrote the greatest part of his history; for he returned 
<A NAME="278"></A>not into his country during the reign of that Dionysius.
<A NAME="279"></A><BR><BR>But after his death, as is just related, Dion's enemies occasioned 
<A NAME="280"></A>him to be recalled home, as fitted for their purpose, and a firm friend 
<A NAME="281"></A>to the arbitrary government. And this, indeed, immediately upon his return 
<A NAME="282"></A>he set himself to maintain; and at the same time various calumnies and 
<A NAME="283"></A>accusations against Dion were by others brought to the king: as that he 
<A NAME="284"></A>held correspondence with Theodotes and Heraclides, to subvert the government; 
<A NAME="285"></A>as, doubtless, it is likely enough, that Dion had entertained hopes, by 
<A NAME="286"></A>the coming of Plato, to mitigate the rigid and despotic severity of the 
<A NAME="287"></A>tyranny, and to give Dionysius the character of a fair and lawful governor; 
<A NAME="288"></A>and had determined, if he should continue averse to that, and were not 
<A NAME="289"></A>to be reclaimed, to depose him, and restore the commonwealth to the Syracusans; 
<A NAME="290"></A>not that he approved a democratic government, but thought it altogether 
<A NAME="291"></A>preferable to a tyranny, when a sound and good aristocracy could not be 
<A NAME="292"></A>procured.
<A NAME="293"></A><BR><BR>This was the state of affairs when Plato came into Sicily, who, 
<A NAME="294"></A>at his first arrival, was received with wonderful demonstration of kindness 
<A NAME="295"></A>and respect. For one of the royal chariots, richly ornamented, was in attendance 
<A NAME="296"></A>to receive him when he came on shore; Dionysius himself sacrificed to the 
<A NAME="297"></A>gods in thankful acknowledgment for the great happiness which had befallen 
<A NAME="298"></A>his government. The citizens, also, began to entertain marvellous hopes 
<A NAME="299"></A>of a speedy reformation, when they observed the modesty which now ruled 
<A NAME="300"></A>in the banquets, and the general decorum which prevailed in all the court, 
<A NAME="301"></A>their tyrant himself also behaving with gentleness and humanity in all 
<A NAME="302"></A>their matters of business that came before him. There was a general passion 
<A NAME="303"></A>for reasoning and philosophy, insomuch that the very palace, it is reported, 
<A NAME="304"></A>was filled with dust by the concourse of the students in mathematics who 
<A NAME="305"></A>were working their problems there. Some few days after, it was the time 
<A NAME="306"></A>of one of the Syracusan sacrifices, and when the priest, as he was wont, 
<A NAME="307"></A>prayed for the long and safe continuance of the tyranny, Dionysius, it 
<A NAME="308"></A>is said, as he stood by, cried out, "Leave off praying for evil upon us." 
<A NAME="309"></A>This sensibly vexed Philistus and his party, who conjectured, that if Plato, 
<A NAME="310"></A>upon such brief acquaintance, had so far transformed and altered the young 
<A NAME="311"></A>man's mind, longer converse and greater intimacy would give him such influence 
<A NAME="312"></A>and authority that it would be impossible to withstand 
<A NAME="313"></A>him.
<A NAME="314"></A><BR><BR>Therefore, no longer privately and apart, but jointly and in public, 
<A NAME="315"></A>all of them, they began to slander Dion, noising it about that he had charmed 
<A NAME="316"></A>and bewitched Dionysius by Plato's sophistry, to the end that when he was 
<A NAME="317"></A>persuaded voluntarily to part with his power, and lay down his authority, 
<A NAME="318"></A>Dion might take it up, and settle it upon his sister Aristomache's children. 
<A NAME="319"></A>Others professed to be indignant that the Athenians, who formerly had come 
<A NAME="320"></A>to Sicily with a great fleet and a numerous land army, and perished miserably 
<A NAME="321"></A>without being able to take the city of Syracuse, should now, by means of 
<A NAME="322"></A>one sophister, overturn the sovereignty of Dionysius; inveighing him to 
<A NAME="323"></A>cashier his guard of ten thousand lances, dismiss a navy of four hundred 
<A NAME="324"></A>galleys, disband an army of ten thousand horse and many times over that 
<A NAME="325"></A>number of foot, and go seek in the schools an unknown and imaginary bliss, 
<A NAME="326"></A>and learn by the mathematics how to be happy; while, in the meantime, the 
<A NAME="327"></A>substantial enjoyments of absolute power, riches, and pleasure would be 
<A NAME="328"></A>handed over to Dion and his sister's children.
<A NAME="329"></A><BR><BR>By these means, Dion began to incur at first suspicion, and by 
<A NAME="330"></A>degrees more apparent displeasure and hostility. A letter, also, was intercepted 
<A NAME="331"></A>and brought to the young prince which Dion had written to the Carthaginian 
<A NAME="332"></A>agents, advising them that, when they treated with Dionysius concerning 
<A NAME="333"></A>the peace, they should not come to their audience without communicating 
<A NAME="334"></A>with him: they would not fail to obtain by this means all that they wanted. 
<A NAME="335"></A>When Dionysius had shown this to Philistus, and consulted with him, as 
<A NAME="336"></A>Timaeus relates, about it, he overreached Dion by a feigned reconciliation, 
<A NAME="337"></A>professing, after some fair and reasonable expression of his feelings, 
<A NAME="338"></A>that he was at friends with him, and thus, leading him alone to the seaside, 
<A NAME="339"></A>under the castle wall, he showed him the letter, and taxed him with conspiring 
<A NAME="340"></A>with the Carthaginians against him. And when Dion essayed to speak in his 
<A NAME="341"></A>own defence, Dionysius suffered him not; but immediately forced him aboard 
<A NAME="342"></A>a boat, which lay there for that purpose, and commanded the sailors to 
<A NAME="343"></A>set him ashore on the coast of Italy.
<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR>When this was publicly known, and was thought very hard usage, 
<A NAME="345"></A>there was much lamentation in the tyrant's own household on account of 
<A NAME="346"></A>the women, but the citizens of Syracuse encouraged themselves, expecting 
<A NAME="347"></A>that for his sake some disturbance would ensue; which, together with the 
<A NAME="348"></A>mistrust others would now feel, might occasion a general change and revolution 
<A NAME="349"></A>in the state. Dionysius seeing this, took alarm, and endeavoured to pacify 
<A NAME="350"></A>the women and others of Dion's kindred and friends, assuring them that 
<A NAME="351"></A>he had not banished, but only sent him out of the way for a time, for fear 
<A NAME="352"></A>of his own passion, which might be provoked some day by Dion's self-will 
<A NAME="353"></A>into some act which he should be sorry for. He gave also two ships to his 
<A NAME="354"></A>relations, with liberty to send into Peloponnesus for him whatever of his 
<A NAME="355"></A>property or servants they thought fit.
<A NAME="356"></A><BR><BR>Dion was very rich, and had his house furnished with little less 
<A NAME="357"></A>than royal splendour and magnificence. These valuables his friends packed 
<A NAME="358"></A>up and conveyed to him, besides many rich presents which were sent him 
<A NAME="359"></A>by the women and his adherents. So that, so far as wealth and riches went, 
<A NAME="360"></A>he made a noble appearance among the Greeks, and they might judge, by the 
<A NAME="361"></A>affluence of the exile, what was the power of the tyrant.
<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR>Dionysius immediately removed Plato into the castle, designing, 
<A NAME="363"></A>under colour of an honourable and kind reception, to set a guard upon him, 
<A NAME="364"></A>lest he should follow Dion, and declare to the world, in his behalf, how 
<A NAME="365"></A>injuriously he had been dealt with. And, moreover, time and conversation 
<A NAME="366"></A>(as wild beasts by use grow tame and tractable) had brought Dionysius to 
<A NAME="367"></A>endure Plato's company and discourse, so that he began to love the philosopher, 
<A NAME="368"></A>but with such an affection as had something of the tyrant in it, requiring 
<A NAME="369"></A>of Plato that he should, in return of his kindness, love him only, and 
<A NAME="370"></A>attend to him above all other men; being ready to permit to his care the 
<A NAME="371"></A>chief management of affairs, and even the government, too, upon condition 
<A NAME="372"></A>that he would not prefer Dion's friendship before his. This extravagant 
<A NAME="373"></A>affection was a great trouble to Plato, for it was accompanied with petulant 
<A NAME="374"></A>and jealous humours, like the fond passions of those that are desperately 
<A NAME="375"></A>in love; frequently he was angry and fell out with him, and presently begged 
<A NAME="376"></A>and entreated to be friends again. He was beyond measure desirous to be 
<A NAME="377"></A>Plato's scholar, and to proceed in the study of philosophy, and yet he 
<A NAME="378"></A>was ashamed of it with those who spoke against it and professed to think 
<A NAME="379"></A>it would ruin him.
<A NAME="380"></A><BR><BR>But a war about this time breaking out, he sent Plato away, promising 
<A NAME="381"></A>him in the summer to recall Dion, though in this he broke his word at once; 
<A NAME="382"></A>nevertheless, he remitted to him his revenues, desiring Plato to excuse 
<A NAME="383"></A>him as to the time appointed, because of the war, but, as soon as he had 
<A NAME="384"></A>settled a peace, he would immediately send for Dion, requiring him in the 
<A NAME="385"></A>interim to be quiet, and not raise any disturbance, nor speak ill of him 
<A NAME="386"></A>among the Grecians. This Plato endeavoured to effect, by keeping Dion with 
<A NAME="387"></A>him in the academy, and busying him in philosophical 
<A NAME="388"></A>studies.
<A NAME="389"></A><BR><BR>Dion sojourned in the Upper Town of Athens, with Callippus, one 
<A NAME="390"></A>of his acquaintance; but for his pleasure he bought a seat in the country, 
<A NAME="391"></A>which afterwards, when he went into Sicily, he gave to Speusippus, who 
<A NAME="392"></A>had been his most frequent companion while he was at Athens, Plato so arranging 
<A NAME="393"></A>it, with the hope that Dion's austere temper might be softened by agreeable 
<A NAME="394"></A>company, with an occasional mixture of seasonable mirth. For Speusippus 
<A NAME="395"></A>was of the character to afford him this; we find him spoken of in Timon's 
<A NAME="396"></A>Silli, as "good at a jest." And Plato himself, as it happened, being called 
<A NAME="397"></A>upon to furnish a chorus of boys, Dion took upon him the ordering and management 
<A NAME="398"></A>of it, and defrayed the whole expense, Plato giving him this opportunity 
<A NAME="399"></A>to oblige the Athenians, which was likely to procure his friend more kindness 
<A NAME="400"></A>than himself credit. Dion went also to see several other cities, visiting 
<A NAME="401"></A>the noblest and most statesmanlike persons in Greece, and joining in their 
<A NAME="402"></A>recreations and entertainments in their times of festival. In all which, 
<A NAME="403"></A>no sort of vulgar ignorance, or tyrannic assumption, or luxuriousness was 
<A NAME="404"></A>remarked in him; but, on the contrary, a great deal of temperance, generosity, 
<A NAME="405"></A>and courage, and a well-becoming taste for reasoning and philosophic discourses. 
<A NAME="406"></A>By which means he gained the love and admiration of all men, and in many 
<A NAME="407"></A>cities had public honours decreed him; the Lacedaemonians making him a 
<A NAME="408"></A>citizen of Sparta, without regard to the displeasure of Dionysius, though 
<A NAME="409"></A>at that time he was aiding them in their wars against the 
<A NAME="410"></A>Thebans.
<A NAME="411"></A><BR><BR>It is related that once, upon invitation, he went to pay a visit 
<A NAME="412"></A>to Ptoeodorus, the Megarian, a man, it would seem, of wealth and importance; 
<A NAME="413"></A>and when, on account of the concourse of people about his door, and the 
<A NAME="414"></A>press of business, it was very troublesome and difficult to get access 
<A NAME="415"></A>to him, turning about to his friends, who seemed concerned and angry at 
<A NAME="416"></A>it, "What reason," said he, "have we to blame Ptoeodorus, when we ourselves 
<A NAME="417"></A>used to do no better when we were at Syracuse?"
<A NAME="418"></A><BR><BR>After some little time, Dionysius, envying Dion, and jealous of 
<A NAME="419"></A>the favour and interest he had among the Grecians, put a stop upon his 
<A NAME="420"></A>incomes, and no longer sent him his revenues, making his own commissioners 
<A NAME="421"></A>trustees of the estate. But, endeavouring to obviate the ill-will and discredit 
<A NAME="422"></A>which, upon Plato's account, might accrue to him among the philosophers, 
<A NAME="423"></A>he collected in his court many reputed learned men; and ambitiously desiring 
<A NAME="424"></A>to surpass them in their debates, he was forced to make use, often incorrectly, 
<A NAME="425"></A>of arguments he had picked up from Plato. And now he wished for his company 
<A NAME="426"></A>again, repenting he had not made better use of it when he had it, and had 
<A NAME="427"></A>given no greater heed to his admirable lessons. Like a tyrant, therefore, 
<A NAME="428"></A>inconsiderate in his desires, headstrong and violent in whatever he took 
<A NAME="429"></A>a will to, on a sudden he was eagerly set on the design of recalling him, 
<A NAME="430"></A>and left no stone unturned, but addressed himself to Archytas, the Pythagorean 
<A NAME="431"></A>(his acquaintance and friendly relations with whom owed their origin to 
<A NAME="432"></A>Plato), and persuaded him to stand as surety for his engagements, and to 
<A NAME="433"></A>request Plato to revisit Sicily.
<A NAME="434"></A><BR><BR>Archytas, therefore, sent Archedemus and Dionysius, some galleys, 
<A NAME="435"></A>with divers friends, to entreat his return; moreover, he wrote to himself 
<A NAME="436"></A>expressly and in plain terms, that Dion must never look for any favour 
<A NAME="437"></A>or kindness if Plato would not be prevailed with to come into Sicily; but 
<A NAME="438"></A>if Plato as often declined, Aristippus, the Cyrenaean, then present, said 
<A NAME="439"></A>that received letters full of solicitations from his sister and his wife, 
<A NAME="440"></A>urging him to beg Plato to gratify Dionysius in this request, and not give 
<A NAME="441"></A>him an excuse for further ill-doing. So that, as Plato says to himself, 
<A NAME="442"></A>the third time he set sail for the Strait of Scylla-
<A NAME="443"></A><BR><BR>"Venturing again Charybdis's dangerous gulf." This arrival brought 
<A NAME="444"></A>great joy to Dionysius, and no less hopes to the Sicilians, who were earnest 
<A NAME="445"></A>in their prayers and good wishes that Plato might get the better of Philistus, 
<A NAME="446"></A>and philosophy triumph over tyranny. Neither was he unbefriended by the 
<A NAME="447"></A>women, who studied to oblige him; and he had with Dionysius that peculiar 
<A NAME="448"></A>credit which no man else ever obtained, namely, liberty to come into his 
<A NAME="449"></A>presence without being examined or searched. When he would have given him 
<A NAME="450"></A>a considerable sum of money, and, on several repeated occasions, made fresh 
<A NAME="451"></A>offers, which Plato did come Dion should be assured of whatever he desired. 
<A NAME="452"></A>Dion also Dionysius was very safe in his munificence, he gave little to 
<A NAME="453"></A>those who were ready to take all they could get, and a great deal to Plato, 
<A NAME="454"></A>who would accept of nothing.
<A NAME="455"></A><BR><BR>After the first compliments of kindness were over, when Plato began 
<A NAME="456"></A>to discourse of Dion, he was at first diverted by excuses for delay, followed 
<A NAME="457"></A>soon after by complaints and disgusts, though not as yet observable to 
<A NAME="458"></A>others, Dionysius endeavouring to conceal them, and, by other civilities 
<A NAME="459"></A>and honourable usage, to draw him off from his affection to Dion. And for 
<A NAME="460"></A>some time Plato himself was careful not to let anything of this dishonesty 
<A NAME="461"></A>and breach of promise appear, but bore with it, and dissembled his annoyance. 
<A NAME="462"></A>While matters stood thus between them, and, as they thought, they were 
<A NAME="463"></A>unobserved and undiscovered, Helicon, the Cyzicenian, one of Plato's followers, 
<A NAME="464"></A>foretold an eclipse of the sun, which happened according to his prediction; 
<A NAME="465"></A>for which he was much admired by the tyrant, and rewarded with a talent 
<A NAME="466"></A>of silver; whereupon Aristippus, jesting with some others of the philosophers, 
<A NAME="467"></A>told them, he also could predict something extraordinary; and on their 
<A NAME="468"></A>entreating him to declare it, "I foretell," said he, "that before long 
<A NAME="469"></A>there will be a quarrel between Dionysius and Plato."
<A NAME="470"></A><BR><BR>At length, Dionysius made sale of Dion's estate, and converted 
<A NAME="471"></A>the money to his own use, and removed Plato from an apartment he had in 
<A NAME="472"></A>the gardens of the palace to lodgings among the guards he kept in pay, 
<A NAME="473"></A>who from the first had hated Plato, and sought opportunity to make away 
<A NAME="474"></A>with him, supposing he advised Dionysius to lay down the government and 
<A NAME="475"></A>disband his soldiers.
<A NAME="476"></A><BR><BR>When Archytas understood the danger he was in, he immediately sent 
<A NAME="477"></A>a galley with messengers to demand him of Dionysius; alleging that he stood 
<A NAME="478"></A>engaged for his safety, upon the confidence of which Plato had come to 
<A NAME="479"></A>Sicily. Dionysius, to palliate his secret hatred, before Plato came away, 
<A NAME="480"></A>treated him with great entertainments and all seeming demonstrations of 
<A NAME="481"></A>kindness, but could not forbear breaking out one day into the expression, 
<A NAME="482"></A>"No doubt, Plato, when you are at home among the philosophers, your companions, 
<A NAME="483"></A>you will complain of me, and reckon up a great many of my faults." To which 
<A NAME="484"></A>Plato answered with a smile, "The Academy will never, I trust, be at such 
<A NAME="485"></A>a loss for subjects to discuss as to seek one in you." Thus, they say, 
<A NAME="486"></A>Plato was dismissed; but his own writings do not altogether agree with 
<A NAME="487"></A>this account.
<A NAME="488"></A><BR><BR>Dion was angry at all this, and not long after declared open enmity 
<A NAME="489"></A>to Dionysius, on hearing what had been done with his wife; on which matter 
<A NAME="490"></A>Plato, also, had had some confidential correspondence with Dionysius. Thus 
<A NAME="491"></A>it was. After Dion's banishment, Dionysius, when he sent Plato back, had 
<A NAME="492"></A>desired him to ask Dion privately, if he would be averse to his wife's 
<A NAME="493"></A>marrying another man. For there went a report, whether true, or raised 
<A NAME="494"></A>by Dion's enemies, that his marriage was not pleasing to him, and that 
<A NAME="495"></A>he lived with his wife on uneasy terms. When Plato therefore came to Athens, 
<A NAME="496"></A>and had mentioned the subject to Dion, he wrote a letter to Dionysius speaking 
<A NAME="497"></A>of other matters openly, but on this in language expressly designed to 
<A NAME="498"></A>be understood by him alone, to the effect that he had talked with Dion 
<A NAME="499"></A>about the business, and that it was evident he would highly resent the 
<A NAME="500"></A>affront, if it should be put into execution. At that time, therefore, while 
<A NAME="501"></A>there were yet great hopes of an accommodation, he took no new steps with 
<A NAME="502"></A>his sister, suffering her to live with Dion's child. But when things were 
<A NAME="503"></A>come to that pass, that no reconciliation could be expected, and Plato, 
<A NAME="504"></A>after his second visit, was again sent away in displeasure, he then forced 
<A NAME="505"></A>Arete, against her will, to marry Timocrates, one of his favourites; in 
<A NAME="506"></A>this action coming short even of his father's justice and lenity; for he, 
<A NAME="507"></A>when Polyxenus, the husband of his sister, Theste, became his enemy, and 
<A NAME="508"></A>fled in alarm out of Sicily, sent for his sister, and taxed her, that, 
<A NAME="509"></A>being privy to her husband's flight, she had not declared it to him. But 
<A NAME="510"></A>the lady, confident and fearless, made him this reply: "Do you believe 
<A NAME="511"></A>me, brother, so bad a wife, or so timorous a woman, that having known my 
<A NAME="512"></A>husband's flight, I would not have borne his company, and shared his fortunes? 
<A NAME="513"></A>I knew nothing of it; since otherwise it had been my better lot to be called 
<A NAME="514"></A>the wife of the exile Polyxenus than the sister of the tyrant Dionysius." 
<A NAME="515"></A>It is said, he admired her free and ready answer, as did the Syracusans 
<A NAME="516"></A>also her courage and virtue, insomuch that she retained her dignity and 
<A NAME="517"></A>princely retinue after the dissolution of the tyranny, and when she died, 
<A NAME="518"></A>the citizens, by public decree, attended the solemnity of her funeral. 
<A NAME="519"></A>And the story, though a digression from the present purpose, was well worth 
<A NAME="520"></A>the telling.
<A NAME="521"></A><BR><BR>From this time, Dion set his mind upon warlike measures; with which 
<A NAME="522"></A>Plato, out of respect for past hospitalities, and because of his age, would 
<A NAME="523"></A>have nothing to do. But Speusippus and the rest of his friends assisted 
<A NAME="524"></A>and encouraged him, bidding him deliver Sicily, which with lift-up hands 
<A NAME="525"></A>implored his help, and with open arms was ready to receive him. For when 
<A NAME="526"></A>Plato was staying at Syracuse, Speusippus, being oftener than he in company 
<A NAME="527"></A>with the citizens, had more thoroughly made out how they were inclined; 
<A NAME="528"></A>and though at first they had been on their guard, suspecting his bold language, 
<A NAME="529"></A>as though he had been set on by the tyrant to trepan them, yet at length 
<A NAME="530"></A>they trusted him. There was but one mind and one wish or prayer among them 
<A NAME="531"></A>all, that Dion would undertake the design, and come, though without either 
<A NAME="532"></A>navy, men, horse, or arms; that he would simply put himself aboard any 
<A NAME="533"></A>ship, and lend the Sicilians his person and name against Dionysius. This 
<A NAME="534"></A>information from Speusippus encouraged Dion, who, concealing his real purpose, 
<A NAME="535"></A>employed his friends privately to raise what men they could; and many statesmen 
<A NAME="536"></A>and philosophers were assisting him, as, for instance, Eudemus the Cyprian, 
<A NAME="537"></A>on whose death Aristotle wrote his Dialogue of the Soul, and Timonides 
<A NAME="538"></A>the Leucadian. They also engaged on his side Miltas the Thessalian, who 
<A NAME="539"></A>was a prophet, and had studied in the Academy. But of all that were banished 
<A NAME="540"></A>by Dionysius, who were not fewer than a thousand, five and twenty only 
<A NAME="541"></A>joined in the enterprise; the rest were afraid, and abandoned it. The rendezvous 
<A NAME="542"></A>was in the island Zacynthus, where a small force of not quite eight hundred 
<A NAME="543"></A>men came together, all of them, however, persons already distinguished 
<A NAME="544"></A>in plenty of previous hard service, their bodies well trained and practised, 
<A NAME="545"></A>and their experience and courage amply sufficient to animate and embolden 
<A NAME="546"></A>to action the numbers whom Dion expected to join in 
<A NAME="547"></A>Sicily.
<A NAME="548"></A><BR><BR>Yet these men, when they first understood the expedition was against 
<A NAME="549"></A>Dionysius, were troubled and disheartened, blaming Dion, that, hurried 
<A NAME="550"></A>on like a madman by mere passion and despair, he rashly threw both himself 
<A NAME="551"></A>and them into certain ruin. Nor were they less angry with their commanders 
<A NAME="552"></A>and muster-masters that they had not in the beginning let them know the 
<A NAME="553"></A>design. But when Dion in his address to them had set forth the unsafe and 
<A NAME="554"></A>weak condition of arbitrary government, and declared that he carried them 
<A NAME="555"></A>rather for commanders than soldiers, the citizens of Syracuse and the rest 
<A NAME="556"></A>of the Sicilians having been long ready for a revolt, and when, after him, 
<A NAME="557"></A>Alcimenes, an Achaean of the highest birth and reputation, who accompanied 
<A NAME="558"></A>the expedition, harangued them to the same effect, they were 
<A NAME="559"></A>contented.
<A NAME="560"></A><BR><BR>It was now the middle of summer, and the Etesian winds blowing 
<A NAME="561"></A>steadily on the seas the moon was at the full, when Dion prepared a magnificent 
<A NAME="562"></A>sacrifice to Apollo, and with great solemnity marched his soldiers to the 
<A NAME="563"></A>temple in all their arms and accoutrements. And after the sacrifice, he 
<A NAME="564"></A>feasted them all in the race-course of the Zacynthians, where he had made 
<A NAME="565"></A>provisions for their entertainment. And when here they beheld with wonder 
<A NAME="566"></A>the quantity and the richness of the gold and silver plate, and the tables 
<A NAME="567"></A>laid to entertain them, all far exceeding the fortunes of a private man, 
<A NAME="568"></A>they concluded with themselves that a man now past the prime of life, who 
<A NAME="569"></A>was master of so much treasure, would not engage himself in so hazardous 
<A NAME="570"></A>an enterprise without good reason of hope, and certain and sufficient assurances 
<A NAME="571"></A>of aid from friends over there. Just after the libations were made, and 
<A NAME="572"></A>the accompanying prayers offered, the moon was eclipsed; which was no wonder 
<A NAME="573"></A>to Dion, who understood the revolutions of eclipses, and the way in which 
<A NAME="574"></A>the moon is overshadowed and the earth interposed between her and the sun. 
<A NAME="575"></A>But because it was necessary that the soldiers, who were surprised and 
<A NAME="576"></A>troubled at it, should be satisfied and encouraged, Miltas the diviner, 
<A NAME="577"></A>standing up in the midst of the assembly, bade them be of good cheer, and 
<A NAME="578"></A>expect all happy success, for that the divine powers foreshowed that something 
<A NAME="579"></A>at present glorious and resplendent should be eclipsed and obscured; nothing 
<A NAME="580"></A>at this time being more splendid than the sovereignty of Dionysius, their 
<A NAME="581"></A>arrival in Sicily should dim this glory, and extinguish this brightness. 
<A NAME="582"></A>Thus Miltas, in public, descanted upon the incident. But concerning a swarm 
<A NAME="583"></A>of bees which settled on the poop of Dion's ship, he privately told him 
<A NAME="584"></A>and his friends that he feared the great actions they were like to perform, 
<A NAME="585"></A>though for a time they should thrive and flourish, would be of short continuance, 
<A NAME="586"></A>and soon suffer a decay. It is reported, also, that many prodigies happened 
<A NAME="587"></A>to Dionysius at that time. An eagle, snatching a javelin from one of the 
<A NAME="588"></A>guard, carried it aloft, and from thence let it fall into the sea. The 
<A NAME="589"></A>water of the sea that washed the castle walls was for a whole day sweet 
<A NAME="590"></A>and potable, as many that tasted it experienced. Pigs were farrowed perfect 
<A NAME="591"></A>in all their other parts, but without ears. This the diviners declared 
<A NAME="592"></A>to portend revolt and rebellion, for that the subjects would no longer 
<A NAME="593"></A>give ear to the commands of their superiors. They expounded the sweetness 
<A NAME="594"></A>of the water to signify to the Syracusans a change from hard and grievous 
<A NAME="595"></A>times into easier and more happy circumstances. The eagle being the bird 
<A NAME="596"></A>of Jupiter, and the spear an emblem of power and command, this prodigy 
<A NAME="597"></A>was to denote that the chief of the gods designed the end and dissolution 
<A NAME="598"></A>of the present government. These things Theopompus relates in his 
<A NAME="599"></A>history.
<A NAME="600"></A><BR><BR>Two ships of burden carried all Dion's men; a third vessel, of 
<A NAME="601"></A>no great size, and two galleys of thirty oars attended them. In addition 
<A NAME="602"></A>to his soldiers' own arms, he carried two thousand shields, a very great 
<A NAME="603"></A>number of darts and lances, and abundant stores of all manner of provisions, 
<A NAME="604"></A>that there might be no want of anything in their voyage; their purpose 
<A NAME="605"></A>being to keep out at sea during the whole voyage, and use the winds, since 
<A NAME="606"></A>all the land was hostile to them, and Philistus, they had been told, was 
<A NAME="607"></A>in Iapygia with a fleet, looking out for them. Twelve days they sailed 
<A NAME="608"></A>with a fresh and gentle breeze; on the thirteenth, they made Pachynus, 
<A NAME="609"></A>the Sicilian cape. There Protus, the chief pilot, advised them to land 
<A NAME="610"></A>at once and without delay, for if they were forced again from the shore, 
<A NAME="611"></A>and did not take advantage of the headland, they might ride out at sea 
<A NAME="612"></A>many nights and days, waiting for a southerly wind in the summer season. 
<A NAME="613"></A>But Dion, fearing a descent too near his enemies, and desirous to begin 
<A NAME="614"></A>at a greater distance, and further on in the country, sailed on past Pachynus. 
<A NAME="615"></A>They had not gone far, before stress of weather, the wind blowing hard 
<A NAME="616"></A>at north, drove the fleet from the coast; and it being now about the time 
<A NAME="617"></A>that Arcturus rises, a violent storm of wind and rain came on, with thunder 
<A NAME="618"></A>and lightning; the mariners were at their wits' end, and ignorant what 
<A NAME="619"></A>course they ran, until on a sudden they found they were driving with the 
<A NAME="620"></A>sea on Cercina, the island on the coast of Africa, just where it is most 
<A NAME="621"></A>craggy and dangerous to run upon. Upon the cliffs there they escaped narrowly 
<A NAME="622"></A>of being forced and staved to pieces; but, labouring hard at their oars, 
<A NAME="623"></A>with much difficulty they kept clear until the storm ceased. Then, lighting 
<A NAME="624"></A>by chance upon a vessel, they understood they were upon the Heads, as it 
<A NAME="625"></A>is called, of the Great Syrtis; and when they were now again disheartened 
<A NAME="626"></A>by a sudden calm, and beating to and fro without making any way, a soft 
<A NAME="627"></A>air began to blow from the land, when they expected anything rather than 
<A NAME="628"></A>wind from the south, and scarce believed the happy change of their fortune. 
<A NAME="629"></A>The gale gradually increasing, and beginning to blow fresh, they clapped 
<A NAME="630"></A>on all their sails, and, praying to the gods, put out again into the open 
<A NAME="631"></A>seas, steering right from Africa for Sicily. And, running steady before 
<A NAME="632"></A>the wind, the fifth day they arrived at Minoa, a little town of Sicily, 
<A NAME="633"></A>in the dominion of the Carthaginians, of which Synalus, an acquaintance 
<A NAME="634"></A>and friend of Dion's, happened at that time to be governor; who, not knowing 
<A NAME="635"></A>it was Dion and his fleet, endeavoured to hinder his men from landing; 
<A NAME="636"></A>but they rushed on shore with their swords in their hands, not slaying 
<A NAME="637"></A>any of their opponents (for this Dion had forbidden, because of his friendship 
<A NAME="638"></A>with the Carthaginians), but forced them to retreat, and, following close, 
<A NAME="639"></A>pressed in a body with them into the place, and took it. As soon as the 
<A NAME="640"></A>two commanders met, they mutually saluted each other; Dion delivered up 
<A NAME="641"></A>the place again to Synalus, without the least damage done to any one therein, 
<A NAME="642"></A>and Synalus quartered and entertained the soldiers, and supplied Dion with 
<A NAME="643"></A>what he wanted.
<A NAME="644"></A><BR><BR>They were most of all encouraged by the happy accident of Dionysius' 
<A NAME="645"></A>absence at this nick of time; for it appeared that he was lately gone with 
<A NAME="646"></A>eighty sail of ships to Italy. Therefore, when Dion was desirous that the 
<A NAME="647"></A>soldiers should refresh themselves there, after their tedious and troublesome 
<A NAME="648"></A>voyage, they would not be prevailed with, but earnest to make the best 
<A NAME="649"></A>use of that opportunity, they urged Dion to lead them straight on to Syracuse. 
<A NAME="650"></A>Leaving, therefore, their baggage, and the arms they did not use, Dion 
<A NAME="651"></A>desired Synalus to convey them to him as he had occasion, and marched directly 
<A NAME="652"></A>to Syracuse.
<A NAME="653"></A><BR><BR>The first that came in to him upon his march were two hundred horse 
<A NAME="654"></A>of the Agrigentines who were settled near Ecnomum, and, after them, the 
<A NAME="655"></A>Geloans. But the news soon flying to Syracuse, Timocrates, who had married 
<A NAME="656"></A>Dion's wife, the sister of Dionysius, and was the principal man among his 
<A NAME="657"></A>friends now remaining in the city, immediately despatched a courier to 
<A NAME="658"></A>Dionysius, with letters announcing Dion's arrival; while he himself took 
<A NAME="659"></A>all possible care to prevent any stir or tumult in the city, where all 
<A NAME="660"></A>were in great excitement, but as yet continued quiet, fearing to give too 
<A NAME="661"></A>much credit to what was reported. A very strange accident happened to the 
<A NAME="662"></A>messenger who was sent with the letters; for being arrived in Italy, as 
<A NAME="663"></A>he travelled through the land of Rhegium, hastening to Dionysius at Caulonia, 
<A NAME="664"></A>he met one of his acquaintance, who was carrying home part of a sacrifice. 
<A NAME="665"></A>He accepted a piece of the flesh, which his friend offered him, and proceeded 
<A NAME="666"></A>on his journey with all speed; having travelled a good part of the night, 
<A NAME="667"></A>and being, through weariness, forced to take a little rest, he laid himself 
<A NAME="668"></A>down in the next convenient place he came to, which was in a wood near 
<A NAME="669"></A>the road. A wolf, scenting the flesh, came and seized it as it lay fastened 
<A NAME="670"></A>to the letter-bag, and with the flesh carried away the bag also, in which 
<A NAME="671"></A>were the letters to Dionysius. The man, awaking and missing his bag, sought 
<A NAME="672"></A>for it up and down a great while, and, not finding it, resolved not to 
<A NAME="673"></A>go to the king without his letters, but to conceal himself, and keep out 
<A NAME="674"></A>of the way.
<A NAME="675"></A><BR><BR>Dionysius, therefore, came to hear of the war in Sicily from other 
<A NAME="676"></A>hands, and that a good while after. In the meantime, as Dion proceeded 
<A NAME="677"></A>in his march, the Camarineans joined his forces, and the country people 
<A NAME="678"></A>in the territory of Syracuse rose and joined him in a large body. The Leontines 
<A NAME="679"></A>and Campanians, who, with Timocrates, guarded the Epipolae, receiving a 
<A NAME="680"></A>false alarm which was spread on purpose by Dion, as if he intended to attack 
<A NAME="681"></A>their cities first, left Timocrates, and hastened off to carry succour 
<A NAME="682"></A>to their own homes. News of which being brought to Dion, where he lay near 
<A NAME="683"></A>Macrae, he raised his camp by night, and came to the river Anapus which 
<A NAME="684"></A>is distant from the city about ten furlongs; there he made a halt, and 
<A NAME="685"></A>sacrificed by the river, offering vows to the rising sun. The soothsayers 
<A NAME="686"></A>declared that the gods promised him victory; and they that were present, 
<A NAME="687"></A>seeing him assisting at the sacrifice with a garland on his head, one and 
<A NAME="688"></A>all crowned themselves with garlands. There were about five thousand that 
<A NAME="689"></A>had joined his forces in their march; who, though but ill-provided, with 
<A NAME="690"></A>such weapons as came next to hand, made up by zeal and courage for the 
<A NAME="691"></A>want of better arms; and when once they were told to advance, as if Dion 
<A NAME="692"></A>were already conqueror, they ran forward with shouts and acclamations, 
<A NAME="693"></A>encouraging each other with the hopes of liberty.
<A NAME="694"></A><BR><BR>The most considerable men and better sort of the citizens of Syracuse, 
<A NAME="695"></A>clad all in white, met him at the gates. The populace set upon all that 
<A NAME="696"></A>were of Dionysius's party, and principally searched for those they called 
<A NAME="697"></A>setters or informers, a number of wicked and hateful wretches, who made 
<A NAME="698"></A>it their business to go up and down the city, thrusting themselves into 
<A NAME="699"></A>all companies, that they might inform Dionysius what men said, and how 
<A NAME="700"></A>they stood affected. These were the first that suffered, being beaten to 
<A NAME="701"></A>death by the crowd.
<A NAME="702"></A><BR><BR>Timocrates, not being able to force his way to the garrison that 
<A NAME="703"></A>kept the castle, took horse, and fled out of the city, filling all the 
<A NAME="704"></A>places where he came with fear and confusion, magnifying the amount of 
<A NAME="705"></A>Dion's forces that he might not be supposed to have deserted his charge 
<A NAME="706"></A>without good reason for it. By this time, Dion was come up, and appeared 
<A NAME="707"></A>in the sight of the people; he marched first in a rich suit of arms, and 
<A NAME="708"></A>by him on one hand his brother, Megacles, on the other, Callippus the Athenian, 
<A NAME="709"></A>crowned with garlands. Of the foreign soldiers, a hundred followed as his 
<A NAME="710"></A>guard, and their several officers led the rest in good order; the Syracusans 
<A NAME="711"></A>looking on and welcoming them, as if they believed the whole to be a sacred 
<A NAME="712"></A>and religious procession, to celebrate the solemn entrance, after an absence 
<A NAME="713"></A>of forty-eight years, of liberty and popular government.
<A NAME="714"></A><BR><BR>Dion entered by the Menitid gate, and having by sound of trumpet 
<A NAME="715"></A>quieted the noise of the people, he caused proclamation to be made, that 
<A NAME="716"></A>Dion and Megacles, who were come to overthrow the tyrannical government, 
<A NAME="717"></A>did declare the Syracusans and all other Sicilians to be free from the 
<A NAME="718"></A>tyrant. But, being desirous to harangue the people himself, he went up 
<A NAME="719"></A>through the Achradina. The citizens on each side the way brought victims 
<A NAME="720"></A>for sacrifice, set out their tables and goblets, and as he passed by each 
<A NAME="721"></A>door threw flowers and ornaments upon him, with vows and acclamations, 
<A NAME="722"></A>honouring him as a god. There was under the castle and the Pentapyla a 
<A NAME="723"></A>lofty and conspicuous sun-dial, which Dionysius had set up. Getting up 
<A NAME="724"></A>upon the top of that, he made an oration to the people, calling upon them 
<A NAME="725"></A>to maintain and defend their liberty; who, with great expressions of joy 
<A NAME="726"></A>and acknowledgment, created Dion and Megacles generals, with plenary powers, 
<A NAME="727"></A>joining in commission with them, at their desire and entreaty, twenty colleagues, 
<A NAME="728"></A>of whom half were of those that had returned with them out of banishment. 
<A NAME="729"></A>It seemed also to the diviners a most happy omen that Dion, when he made 
<A NAME="730"></A>his address to the people, had under his feet the stately monument which 
<A NAME="731"></A>Dionysius had been at such pains to erect; but because it was a sun-dial 
<A NAME="732"></A>on which he stood when he was made general, they expressed some fears that 
<A NAME="733"></A>the great actions he had performed might be subject to change, and admit 
<A NAME="734"></A>some rapid turn and declination of fortune.
<A NAME="735"></A><BR><BR>After this, Dion, taking the Epipolae, released the citizens who 
<A NAME="736"></A>were imprisoned there, and then raised a wall to invest the castle. Seven 
<A NAME="737"></A>days after, Dionysius arrived by sea, and got into the citadel, and about 
<A NAME="738"></A>the same time came carriages, bringing the arms and ammunition which Dion 
<A NAME="739"></A>had left with Synalus. These he distributed among the citizens; and the 
<A NAME="740"></A>rest that wanted furnished themselves as well as they could, and put themselves 
<A NAME="741"></A>in the condition of zealous and serviceable men-at-arms.
<A NAME="742"></A><BR><BR>Dionysius sent agents, at first privately, to Dion, to try what 
<A NAME="743"></A>terms they could make with him. But he declaring that any overtures they 
<A NAME="744"></A>had to make must be made in public to the Syracusans as a free people, 
<A NAME="745"></A>envoys now went and came between the tyrant and the people, with fair proposals, 
<A NAME="746"></A>and assurances that they should have abatements of their tributes and taxes, 
<A NAME="747"></A>and freedom from the burdens of military expeditions, all which should 
<A NAME="748"></A>be made according to their own approbation and consent with him. The Syracusans 
<A NAME="749"></A>laughed at these offers, and Dion returned answer to the envoys, that Dionysius 
<A NAME="750"></A>must not think to treat with them upon any other terms but resigning the 
<A NAME="751"></A>government; which if he would actually do, he would not forget how nearly 
<A NAME="752"></A>he was related to him, or be wanting to assist him in procuring oblivion 
<A NAME="753"></A>for the past, and whatever else was reasonable and just. Dionysius seemed 
<A NAME="754"></A>to consent to this, and sent his agents again, desiring some of the Syracusans 
<A NAME="755"></A>to come into the citadel and discuss with him in person the terms to which 
<A NAME="756"></A>on each side they might be willing, after fair debate, to consent. There 
<A NAME="757"></A>were, therefore, some deputed, such as Dion approved of; and the general 
<A NAME="758"></A>rumour from the castle was, that Dionysius would voluntarily resign his 
<A NAME="759"></A>authority, and rather do it himself as his own good deed than let it be 
<A NAME="760"></A>the act of Dion. But this profession was a mere trick to amuse the Syracusans. 
<A NAME="761"></A>For he put the deputies that were sent to him in custody, and by break 
<A NAME="762"></A>of day, having first to encourage his men made them drink plentifully of 
<A NAME="763"></A>raw wine, he sent the garrison of mercenaries out to make a sudden sally 
<A NAME="764"></A>against Dion's works. The attack was quite unexpected, and the barbarians 
<A NAME="765"></A>set to work boldly with loud cries to pull down the cross-wall, and assailed 
<A NAME="766"></A>the Syracusans so furiously that they were not able to maintain their post. 
<A NAME="767"></A>Only a party of Dion's hired soldiers, on first taking the alarm, advanced 
<A NAME="768"></A>to the rescue; neither did they at first know what to do, or how to employ 
<A NAME="769"></A>the aid they brought, not being able to hear the commands of their officers, 
<A NAME="770"></A>amidst the noise and confusion of the Syracusans, who fled from the enemy 
<A NAME="771"></A>and ran in among them, breaking through their ranks, until Dion, seeing 
<A NAME="772"></A>none of his orders could be heard, resolved to let them see by example 
<A NAME="773"></A>what they ought to do, and charged into the thickest of the enemy. The 
<A NAME="774"></A>fight about him was fierce and bloody, he being as well known by the enemy 
<A NAME="775"></A>as by his own party, and all running with loud cries to the quarters where 
<A NAME="776"></A>he fought. Though his time of life was no longer that of the bodily strength 
<A NAME="777"></A>and agility for such a combat, still his determination and courage were 
<A NAME="778"></A>sufficient to maintain him against all that attacked him; but, while bravely 
<A NAME="779"></A>driving them back, he was wounded in the hand with a lance, his body armour 
<A NAME="780"></A>also had been much battered, and was scarcely any longer serviceable to 
<A NAME="781"></A>protect him, either against missiles or blows hand-to-hand. Many spears 
<A NAME="782"></A>and javelins had passed into it through the shield, and, on these being 
<A NAME="783"></A>broken back, he fell to the ground, but was immediately rescued, and carried 
<A NAME="784"></A>off by his soldiers. The command-in-chief he left to Timonides, and, mounting 
<A NAME="785"></A>a horse, rode about the city, rallying the Syracusans that fled; and, ordering 
<A NAME="786"></A>up a detachment of the foreign soldiers out of Achradina, where they were 
<A NAME="787"></A>posted on guard, he brought them as a fresh reserve, eager for battle, 
<A NAME="788"></A>upon the tired and failing enemy, who were already well inclined to give 
<A NAME="789"></A>up their design. For having hopes at their first sally to take the whole 
<A NAME="790"></A>city, when beyond their expectation they found themselves engaged with 
<A NAME="791"></A>bold and practised fighters, they fell back towards the castle. As soon 
<A NAME="792"></A>as they gave ground, the Greek soldiers pressed the harder upon them, till 
<A NAME="793"></A>they turned and fled within the walls. There were lost in this action seventy-four 
<A NAME="794"></A>of Dion's men, and a very great number of the enemy. This being a signal 
<A NAME="795"></A>victory, and principally obtained by the valour of the foreign soldiers, 
<A NAME="796"></A>the Syracusans rewarded them in honour of it with a hundred minae, and 
<A NAME="797"></A>the soldiers on their part presented Dion with a crown of 
<A NAME="798"></A>gold.
<A NAME="799"></A><BR><BR>Soon after, there came heralds from Dionysius bringing Dion letters 
<A NAME="800"></A>from the women of his family, and one addressed outside, "To his father, 
<A NAME="801"></A>from Hipparinus;" this was the name of Dion's son, though Timaeus says, 
<A NAME="802"></A>he was, from his mother Arete's name, called Aretaeus; but I think credit 
<A NAME="803"></A>is rather to be given to Timonides's report, who was his father's fellow-soldier 
<A NAME="804"></A>and confidant. The rest of the letters were read publicly, containing many 
<A NAME="805"></A>solicitations and humble requests of the women; that professing to be from 
<A NAME="806"></A>his son, the heralds would not have them open publicly, but Dion, putting 
<A NAME="807"></A>force upon them, broke the seal. It was from Dionysius, written in the 
<A NAME="808"></A>terms of it to Dion, but in effect to the Syracusans, and so worded that, 
<A NAME="809"></A>under a plausible justification of himself and entreaty to him, means were 
<A NAME="810"></A>taken for rendering him suspected by the people. It reminded him of the 
<A NAME="811"></A>good service he had formerly done the usurping government, it added threats 
<A NAME="812"></A>to his dearest relations, his sister, son, and wife, if he did not comply 
<A NAME="813"></A>with the contents, also passionate demands mingled with lamentations, and, 
<A NAME="814"></A>most to the purpose of all, urgent recommendations to him not to destroy 
<A NAME="815"></A>the government, and put the power into the hands of men who always hated 
<A NAME="816"></A>him, and would never forget their old piques and quarrels; let him take 
<A NAME="817"></A>the sovereignty himself, and so secure the safety of his family and his 
<A NAME="818"></A>friends.
<A NAME="819"></A><BR><BR>When this letter was read, the Syracusans were not, as they should 
<A NAME="820"></A>have been, transported with admiration at the unmovable constancy and magnanimity 
<A NAME="821"></A>of Dion, who withstood all his dearest interests to be true to virtue and 
<A NAME="822"></A>justice, but, on the contrary, they saw in this their reason for fearing 
<A NAME="823"></A>and suspecting that he lay under an invincible necessity to be favourable 
<A NAME="824"></A>to Dionysius; and they began, therefore, to look out for other leaders, 
<A NAME="825"></A>and the rather because to their great joy they received the news that Heraclides 
<A NAME="826"></A>was on his way. This Heraclides was one of those whom Dionysius had banished, 
<A NAME="827"></A>a very good soldier, and well known for the commands he had formerly had 
<A NAME="828"></A>under the tyrant; yet a man of no constant purpose, of a fickle temper, 
<A NAME="829"></A>and least of all to be relied upon when he had to act with a colleague 
<A NAME="830"></A>in any honourable command. He had had a difference formerly with Dion in 
<A NAME="831"></A>Peloponnesus, and had resolved, upon his own means, with what ships and 
<A NAME="832"></A>soldiers he had, to make an attack upon Dionysius. When he arrived at Syracuse, 
<A NAME="833"></A>with seven galleys and three small vessels, he found Dionysius already 
<A NAME="834"></A>close besieged, and the Syracusans high and proud of their victories. Forthwith, 
<A NAME="835"></A>therefore, he endeavoured by all ways to make himself popular; and, indeed, 
<A NAME="836"></A>he had in him naturally something that was very insinuating and taking 
<A NAME="837"></A>with a populace that loves to be courted. He gained his end, also, the 
<A NAME="838"></A>easier, and drew the people over to his side, because of the dislike they 
<A NAME="839"></A>had taken to Dion's grave and stately manner, which they thought overbearing 
<A NAME="840"></A>and assuming; their successes having made them so careless and confident 
<A NAME="841"></A>that they expected popular arts and flatteries from their leaders before 
<A NAME="842"></A>they had in reality secured a popular government.
<A NAME="843"></A><BR><BR>Getting, therefore, together in an irregular assembly, they chose 
<A NAME="844"></A>Heraclides their admiral; but when Dion came forward, and told them that 
<A NAME="845"></A>conferring this trust upon Heraclides was in effect to withdraw that which 
<A NAME="846"></A>they had granted him, for he was no longer their generalissimo if another 
<A NAME="847"></A>had the command of the navy, they repealed their order, and, though much 
<A NAME="848"></A>against their wills, cancelled the new appointment. When this business 
<A NAME="849"></A>was over, Dion invited Heraclides to his house, and pointed out to him, 
<A NAME="850"></A>in gentle terms, that he had not acted wisely or well to quarrel with him 
<A NAME="851"></A>upon a punctilio of honour, at a time when the least false step might be 
<A NAME="852"></A>the ruin of all; and then, calling a fresh assembly of the people, he there 
<A NAME="853"></A>named Heraclides admiral, and prevailed with the citizens to allow him 
<A NAME="854"></A>a life-guard, as he himself had.
<A NAME="855"></A><BR><BR>Heraclides openly professed the highest respect for Dion, and made 
<A NAME="856"></A>him great acknowledgments for this favour, attending him with all deference, 
<A NAME="857"></A>as ready to receive his commands but underhand he kept up his dealings 
<A NAME="858"></A>with the populace and the unrulier citizens, unsettling their minds and 
<A NAME="859"></A>disturbing them with his complaints, and putting Dion into the utmost perplexity 
<A NAME="860"></A>and disquiet. For if he advised to give Dionysius leave to quit the castle, 
<A NAME="861"></A>he would be exposed to the imputation of sparing and protecting him; if, 
<A NAME="862"></A>to avoid giving offence or suspicion, he simply continued the siege, they 
<A NAME="863"></A>would say he protracted the war to keep his office of general the longer 
<A NAME="864"></A>and overawe the citizens.
<A NAME="865"></A><BR><BR>There was one Sosis, notorious in the city for his bad conduct 
<A NAME="866"></A>and his impudence, yet a favourite with the people, for the very reason 
<A NAME="867"></A>that they liked to see it made a part of popular privileges to carry free 
<A NAME="868"></A>speech to this excess of licence. This man, out of a design against Dion, 
<A NAME="869"></A>stood up one day in an assembly, and, having sufficiently railed at the 
<A NAME="870"></A>citizens as a set of fools that could not see how they had made an exchange 
<A NAME="871"></A>of a dissolute and drunken for a sober and watchful despotism, and thus 
<A NAME="872"></A>having publicly declared himself Dion's enemy, took his leave. The next 
<A NAME="873"></A>day he was seen running through the streets, as if he fled from some that 
<A NAME="874"></A>pursued him, almost naked, wounded in the head, and bloody all over. In 
<A NAME="875"></A>this condition, getting people about him in the market-place, he told them 
<A NAME="876"></A>that he had been assaulted by Dion's men; and, to confirm what he said, 
<A NAME="877"></A>showed them the wounds he had received in his head. And a good many took 
<A NAME="878"></A>his part, exclaiming loudly against Dion for his cruel and tyrannical conduct, 
<A NAME="879"></A>stopping the mouths of the people by bloodshed and peril of life. Just 
<A NAME="880"></A>as an assembly was gathering in this unsettled and tumultuous state of 
<A NAME="881"></A>mind, Dion came before them, and made it appear how this Sosis was brother 
<A NAME="882"></A>to one of Dionysius's guard, and that he was set on by him to embroil the 
<A NAME="883"></A>city in tumult and confusion; Dionysius having now no way left for his 
<A NAME="884"></A>security but to make his advantage of their dissensions and distractions. 
<A NAME="885"></A>The surgeons, also, having searched the wound, found it was rather raised 
<A NAME="886"></A>than cut with a downright blow; for the wounds made with a sword are, from 
<A NAME="887"></A>their mere weight, most commonly deepest in the middle, but this was very 
<A NAME="888"></A>slight, and all along of an equal depth; and it was not one continued wound, 
<A NAME="889"></A>as if cut at once, but several incisions, in all probability made at several 
<A NAME="890"></A>times, as he was able to endure the pain. There were credible persons, 
<A NAME="891"></A>also, who brought a razor, and showed it in the assembly, stating that 
<A NAME="892"></A>they met Sosis, running in the street, all bloody, who told them that he 
<A NAME="893"></A>was flying from Dion's soldiers, who had just attacked and wounded him; 
<A NAME="894"></A>they ran at once to look after them, and met no one, but spied this razor 
<A NAME="895"></A>lying under a hollow stone near the place from which they observed he 
<A NAME="896"></A>came.
<A NAME="897"></A><BR><BR>Sosis was now likely to come by the worst of it. But, when to back 
<A NAME="898"></A>all this, his own servants came in, and gave evidence that he had left 
<A NAME="899"></A>his house alone before break of day, with the razor in his hand, Dion's 
<A NAME="900"></A>accusers withdrew themselves, and the people by a general vote condemned 
<A NAME="901"></A>Sosis to die, being once again well satisfied with Dion and his 
<A NAME="902"></A>proceedings.
<A NAME="903"></A><BR><BR>Yet they were still as jealous as before of his soldiers, and the 
<A NAME="904"></A>rather because the war was now carried on principally by sea; Philistus 
<A NAME="905"></A>being come from Iapygia with a great fleet to Dionysius's assistance. They 
<A NAME="906"></A>supposed, therefore, that there would be no longer need of the soldiers, 
<A NAME="907"></A>who were all landsmen and armed accordingly; these were rather, indeed, 
<A NAME="908"></A>they thought, in a condition to be protected by themselves, who were seamen, 
<A NAME="909"></A>and had their power in their shipping. Their good opinion of themselves 
<A NAME="910"></A>was also much enhanced by an advantage they got in an engagement by sea, 
<A NAME="911"></A>in which they took Philistus prisoner, and used him in a barbarous and 
<A NAME="912"></A>cruel manner. Ephorus relates that when he saw his ship was taken, he slew 
<A NAME="913"></A>himself. But Timonides, who was with Dion from the very first, and was 
<A NAME="914"></A>present at all the events as they occurred, writing to Speusippus the philosopher, 
<A NAME="915"></A>relates the story thus: that Philistus's galley running aground, he was 
<A NAME="916"></A>taken prisoner alive, and first disarmed, then stripped of his corselet, 
<A NAME="917"></A>and exposed naked, being now an old man, to every kind of contumely; after 
<A NAME="918"></A>which they cut off his head, and gave his body to the boys of the town, 
<A NAME="919"></A>bidding them drag it through the Achradina, and then throw it into the 
<A NAME="920"></A>Quarries. Timaeus, to increase the mockery, adds further, that the boys 
<A NAME="921"></A>tied him by his lame leg, and so drew him through the streets, while the 
<A NAME="922"></A>Syracusans stood by laughing and jesting at the sight of that very man 
<A NAME="923"></A>thus tied and dragged about by the leg, who had told Dionysius that, so 
<A NAME="924"></A>far from flying on horseback from Syracuse, he ought to wait till he should 
<A NAME="925"></A>be dragged out by the heels. Philistus, however, has stated that this was 
<A NAME="926"></A>said to Dionysius by another, and not by himself.
<A NAME="927"></A><BR><BR>Timaeus avails himself of this advantage, which Philistus truly 
<A NAME="928"></A>enough affords against himself in his zealous and constant adherence to 
<A NAME="929"></A>the tyranny, to vent his own spleen and malice against him, They, indeed, 
<A NAME="930"></A>who were injured by him at the time, are perhaps excusable, if they carried 
<A NAME="931"></A>their resentment to the length of indignities to his dead body; but they 
<A NAME="932"></A>who write history afterwards, and were noways wronged by him in his lifetime, 
<A NAME="933"></A>and have received assistance from his writings, in honour should not with 
<A NAME="934"></A>opprobrious and scurrilous language upbraid him for those misfortunes which 
<A NAME="935"></A>may well enough befall even the best of men. On the other side, Ephorus 
<A NAME="936"></A>is as much out of the way in his encomiums. For, however ingenious he is 
<A NAME="937"></A>in supplying unjust acts and wicked conduct with fair and worthy motives, 
<A NAME="938"></A>and in selecting decorous and honourable terms, yet when he does his best, 
<A NAME="939"></A>he does not himself stand clear of the charge of being the greatest lover 
<A NAME="940"></A>of tyrants, and the fondest admirer of luxury and power and rich estates 
<A NAME="941"></A>and alliances of marriage with absolute princes. He that neither praises 
<A NAME="942"></A>Philistus for his conduct, nor insults over his misfortunes, seems to me 
<A NAME="943"></A>to take the fittest course.
<A NAME="944"></A><BR><BR>After Philistus's death, Dionysius sent to Dion, offering to surrender 
<A NAME="945"></A>the castle, all the arms, provisions, and garrison soldiers, with full 
<A NAME="946"></A>pay for them for five months, demanding in return that he might have safe 
<A NAME="947"></A>conduct to go unmolested into Italy, and there to continue, and also to 
<A NAME="948"></A>enjoy the revenues of Gyarta, a large and fruitful territory belonging 
<A NAME="949"></A>to Syracuse, reaching from the seaside to the middle of the country. Dion 
<A NAME="950"></A>rejected these proposals, and referred him to the Syracusans. They, hoping 
<A NAME="951"></A>in a short time to take Dionysius alive, dismissed his ambassadors summarily. 
<A NAME="952"></A>But he, leaving his eldest son, Apollocrates, to defend the castle, and 
<A NAME="953"></A>putting on board his ships the persons and the property that he set most 
<A NAME="954"></A>value upon, took the opportunity of a fair wind, and made his escape, undiscovered 
<A NAME="955"></A>by the admiral Heraclides and his fleet.
<A NAME="956"></A><BR><BR>The citizens loudly exclaimed against Heraclides for this neglect; 
<A NAME="957"></A>but he got one of their public speakers, Hippo by name, to go among them, 
<A NAME="958"></A>and make proposals to the assembly for a redivision of lands, alleging 
<A NAME="959"></A>that the first beginning of liberty was equality, and that poverty and 
<A NAME="960"></A>slavery were inseparable companions. In support of this, Heraclides spoke, 
<A NAME="961"></A>and used the faction in favour of it to overpower Dion, who opposed it; 
<A NAME="962"></A>and in fine, he persuaded the people to ratify it by their vote, and further 
<A NAME="963"></A>to decree that the foreign soldiers should receive no pay, and that they 
<A NAME="964"></A>would elect new commanders, and so be rid of Dion's oppression. The people, 
<A NAME="965"></A>attempting, as it were, after their long sickness of despotism, all at 
<A NAME="966"></A>once to stand on their legs, and to do their part, for which they were 
<A NAME="967"></A>yet unfit, of freemen, stumbled in all their actions; and yet hated Dion, 
<A NAME="968"></A>who, like a good physician, endeavoured to keep the city to a strict and 
<A NAME="969"></A>temperate regimen.
<A NAME="970"></A><BR><BR>When they met in the assembly to choose their commanders, about 
<A NAME="971"></A>the middle of summer, unusual and terrible thunders, with other inauspicious 
<A NAME="972"></A>appearances, for fifteen days together, dispersed the people, deterring 
<A NAME="973"></A>them, on grounds of religious fear, from creating new generals. But, at 
<A NAME="974"></A>last, the popular leaders, having found a fair and clear day, and having 
<A NAME="975"></A>got their party together, were proceeding to an election, when a draught-ox, 
<A NAME="976"></A>who was used to the crowd and noise of the streets, but for some reason 
<A NAME="977"></A>or other grew unruly to his driver, breaking from his yoke, ran furiously 
<A NAME="978"></A>into the theatre where they were assembled, and set the people flying and 
<A NAME="979"></A>running in all directions before him in the greatest disorder and confusion; 
<A NAME="980"></A>and from thence went on, leaping and rushing about, over all that part 
<A NAME="981"></A>of the city which the enemies afterwards made themselves masters of. However, 
<A NAME="982"></A>the Syracusans, not regarding all this, elected five-and-twenty captains, 
<A NAME="983"></A>and, among the rest, Heraclides, and underhand tampered with Dion's men, 
<A NAME="984"></A>promising, if they would desert him, and enlist themselves in their service, 
<A NAME="985"></A>to make them citizens of Syracuse, with all the privileges of natives. 
<A NAME="986"></A>But they would not hear the proposals, but, to show their fidelity and 
<A NAME="987"></A>courage, with their swords in their hands, placing Dion for his security 
<A NAME="988"></A>in the midst of their battalion, conveyed him out of the city, not offering 
<A NAME="989"></A>violence to any one, but upbraiding those they met with their baseness 
<A NAME="990"></A>and ingratitude. The citizens, seeing they were but few, and did not offer 
<A NAME="991"></A>any violence, despised them; and, supposing that with their large numbers 
<A NAME="992"></A>they might with ease overpower and cut them off before they got out of 
<A NAME="993"></A>the city, fell upon them in the rear.
<A NAME="994"></A><BR><BR>Here Dion was in a great strait, being necessitated either to fight 
<A NAME="995"></A>against his own countrymen or tamely suffer himself and his faithful soldiers 
<A NAME="996"></A>to be cut in pieces. He used many entreaties to the Syracusans, stretching 
<A NAME="997"></A>out his hands towards the castle that was full of their enemies, and showing 
<A NAME="998"></A>them the soldiers, who in great numbers appeared on the walls and watched 
<A NAME="999"></A>what was doing. But when no persuasions could divert the impulse of the 
<A NAME="1000"></A>multitude, and the whole mass, like the sea in a storm, seemed to be driven 
<A NAME="1001"></A>before the breath of the demagogues, he commanded his men, not to charge 
<A NAME="1002"></A>them, but to advance with shouts and clashing of their arms; which being 
<A NAME="1003"></A>done, not a man of them stood his ground; all fled at once through the 
<A NAME="1004"></A>streets, though none pursued them. For Dion immediately commanded his men 
<A NAME="1005"></A>to face about, and led them towards the city of the 
<A NAME="1006"></A>Leontines.
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR><BR>The very women laughed at the new captains for this retreat; so, 
<A NAME="1008"></A>to redeem their credit, they bid the citizens arm themselves again, and 
<A NAME="1009"></A>followed after Dion, and came up with him as he was passing a river. Some 
<A NAME="1010"></A>of the light-horse rode up and began to skirmish. But when they saw Dion 
<A NAME="1011"></A>no more tame and calm, and no signs in his face of any fatherly tenderness 
<A NAME="1012"></A>towards his countrymen, but with an angry countenance, as resolved not 
<A NAME="1013"></A>to suffer their indignities any longer, bidding his men face round and 
<A NAME="1014"></A>form in their ranks for the onset, they presently turned their backs more 
<A NAME="1015"></A>basely than before, and fled to the city, with the loss of some few of 
<A NAME="1016"></A>their men.
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR><BR>The Leontines received Dion very honourably, gave money to his 
<A NAME="1018"></A>men, and made them free of their city; sending envoys to the Syracusans, 
<A NAME="1019"></A>to require them to do the soldiers justice, who, in return, sent back other 
<A NAME="1020"></A>agents to accuse Dion. But when a general meeting of the confederates met 
<A NAME="1021"></A>in the town of the Leontines, and the matter was heard and debated, the 
<A NAME="1022"></A>Syracusans were held to be in fault. They, however, refused to stand to 
<A NAME="1023"></A>the award of their allies, following their own conceit, and making it their 
<A NAME="1024"></A>pride to listen to no one, and not to have any commanders but those who 
<A NAME="1025"></A>would fear and obey the people.
<A NAME="1026"></A><BR><BR>About this time, Dionysius sent in a fleet, under the command of 
<A NAME="1027"></A>Nypsius the Neapolitan, with provisions and pay for the garrison. The Syracusans 
<A NAME="1028"></A>fought him, had the better, and took four of his ships; but they made very 
<A NAME="1029"></A>ill use of their good success, and for want of good discipline, fell in 
<A NAME="1030"></A>their joy to drinking and feasting in an extravagant manner, with so little 
<A NAME="1031"></A>regard to their main interest that, when they thought themselves sure of 
<A NAME="1032"></A>taking the castle, they actually lost their city. Nypsius, seeing the citizens 
<A NAME="1033"></A>in this general disorder, spending day and night in their drunken singing 
<A NAME="1034"></A>and revelling, and their commanders well pleased with the frolic, or at 
<A NAME="1035"></A>least not daring to try and give any orders to men in their drink, took 
<A NAME="1036"></A>advantage of this opportunity, made a sally, and stormed their works; and 
<A NAME="1037"></A>having made his way through these, let his barbarians loose upon the city, 
<A NAME="1038"></A>giving up it and all that were in it to their pleasure.
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR><BR>The Syracusans quickly saw their folly and misfortune, but could 
<A NAME="1040"></A>not, in the distraction they were in, so soon redress it. The city was 
<A NAME="1041"></A>in actual process of being sacked, the enemy putting the men to the sword, 
<A NAME="1042"></A>demolishing the fortifications, and dragging the women and children, with 
<A NAME="1043"></A>lamentable shrieks and cries, prisoners into the castle. The commanders, 
<A NAME="1044"></A>giving all for lost, were not able to put the citizens in any tolerable 
<A NAME="1045"></A>posture of defence, finding them confusedly mixed up and scattered among 
<A NAME="1046"></A>the enemy. While they were in this condition, and the Achradina in danger 
<A NAME="1047"></A>to be taken, every one was sensible who he was in whom all their remaining 
<A NAME="1048"></A>hopes rested, but no man for shame durst name Dion, whom they had so ungratefully 
<A NAME="1049"></A>and foolishly dealt with. Necessity at last forcing them, some of the auxiliary 
<A NAME="1050"></A>troops and horsemen cried out, "Send for Dion and his Peloponnesians from 
<A NAME="1051"></A>the Leontines." No sooner was the venture made and the name heard among 
<A NAME="1052"></A>the people, but they gave a shout for joy, and, with tears in their eyes, 
<A NAME="1053"></A>wished him there, that they might once again see that leader at the head 
<A NAME="1054"></A>of them, whose courage and bravery in the worst of dangers they well remembered, 
<A NAME="1055"></A>calling to mind not only with what an undaunted spirit he always behaved 
<A NAME="1056"></A>himself, but also with what courage and confidence he inspired them when 
<A NAME="1057"></A>he led them against the enemy. They immediately, therefore, despatched 
<A NAME="1058"></A>Archonides and Telesides of the confederate troops, and of the horsemen 
<A NAME="1059"></A>Hellanicus and four others. These, traversing the road between at their 
<A NAME="1060"></A>horses' full speed, reached the town of the Leontines in the evening. The 
<A NAME="1061"></A>first thing they did was to leap from their horses and fall at Dion's feet, 
<A NAME="1062"></A>relating with tears the sad condition the Syracusans were in. Many of the 
<A NAME="1063"></A>Leontines and Peloponnesians began to throng about them, guessing by their 
<A NAME="1064"></A>speed and the manner of their address that something extraordinary had 
<A NAME="1065"></A>occurred.
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR><BR>Dion at once led the way to the assembly, and the people being 
<A NAME="1067"></A>gathered together in a very little time, Archonides and Hellanicus and 
<A NAME="1068"></A>the others came in among them, and in short declared the misery and distress 
<A NAME="1069"></A>of the Syracusans, begging the foreign soldiers to forget the injuries 
<A NAME="1070"></A>they had received, and assist the afflicted, who had suffered more for 
<A NAME="1071"></A>the wrong they had done than they themselves who received it would (had 
<A NAME="1072"></A>it been in their power) have inflicted upon them. When they had made an 
<A NAME="1073"></A>end, there was a profound silence in the theatre; Dion then stood up, and 
<A NAME="1074"></A>began to speak, but tears stopped his words; his soldiers were troubled 
<A NAME="1075"></A>at his grief, but bade him take good courage and proceed. When he had recovered 
<A NAME="1076"></A>himself a little, therefore, "Men of Peloponnesus," he said, "and of the 
<A NAME="1077"></A>confederacy, I asked for your presence here, that you might consider your 
<A NAME="1078"></A>own interests. For myself, I have no interests to consult while Syracuse 
<A NAME="1079"></A>is perishing, and though I may not save it from destruction, I will nevertheless 
<A NAME="1080"></A>hasten thither, and be buried in the ruins of my country. Yet if you can 
<A NAME="1081"></A>find in your hearts to assist us, the most inconsiderate and unfortunate 
<A NAME="1082"></A>of men, you may to your eternal honour again retrieve this unhappy city. 
<A NAME="1083"></A>But if the Syracusans can obtain no more pity nor relief from you, may 
<A NAME="1084"></A>the gods reward you for what you have formerly valiantly done for them, 
<A NAME="1085"></A>and for your kindness to Dion, of whom speak hereafter as one who deserted 
<A NAME="1086"></A>you not when you were injured and abu
