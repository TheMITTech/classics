<BR>(legendary, reigned 197 B.C.E. - ca. 160 B.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Duris reports that Eumenes, the Cardian, was the son of a poor wagoner 
<A NAME="11"></A>in the Thracian Chersonesus, yet liberally educated, both as a scholar 
<A NAME="12"></A>and a soldier; and that while he was but young, Philip, passing through 
<A NAME="13"></A>Cardia, diverted himself with a sight of the wrestling matches and other 
<A NAME="14"></A>exercises of the youth of that place, among whom Eumenes performing with 
<A NAME="15"></A>success, and showing signs of intelligence and bravery, Philip was so pleased 
<A NAME="16"></A>with him as to take him into his service. But they seem to speak more probably 
<A NAME="17"></A>who tell us that Philip advanced Eumenes for the friendship he bore to 
<A NAME="18"></A>his father, whose guest he had sometime been. After the death of Philip, 
<A NAME="19"></A>he continued in the service of Alexander, with the title of his principal 
<A NAME="20"></A>secretary, but in as great favour as the most intimate of his familiars, 
<A NAME="21"></A>being esteemed as wise and faithful as any person about him, so that he 
<A NAME="22"></A>went with troops under his immediate command as general in the expedition 
<A NAME="23"></A>against India, and succeeded to the post of Perdiccas, when Perdiccas was 
<A NAME="24"></A>advanced to that of Hephaestion, then newly deceased. And therefore, after 
<A NAME="25"></A>the death of Alexander, when Neoptolemus, who had been captain of his life-guard, 
<A NAME="26"></A>said that he had followed Alexander with shield and spear, but Eumenes 
<A NAME="27"></A>only with pen and paper, the Macedonians laughed at him, as knowing very 
<A NAME="28"></A>well that, besides other marks of favour, the king had done him the honour 
<A NAME="29"></A>to make him a kind of kinsman to himself by marriage. For Alexander's first 
<A NAME="30"></A>mistress in Asia, by whom he had his son Hercules, was Barsine the daughter 
<A NAME="31"></A>of Artabazus; and in the distribution of the Persian ladies amongst his 
<A NAME="32"></A>captains, Alexander gave Apame, one of his sisters, to Ptolemy, and another, 
<A NAME="33"></A>also called Barsine, to Eumenes.
<A NAME="34"></A><BR><BR>Notwithstanding, he frequently incurred Alexander's displeasure, 
<A NAME="35"></A>and put himself into some danger, through Hephaestion. The quarters that 
<A NAME="36"></A>had been taken up for Eumenes, Hephaestion assigned to Euius, the flute-player. 
<A NAME="37"></A>Upon which, in great anger, Eumenes and Mentor came to Alexander and loudly 
<A NAME="38"></A>complained, saying that the way to be regarded was to throw away their 
<A NAME="39"></A>arms and turn flute-players or tragedians; so much so that Alexander took 
<A NAME="40"></A>their part and chid Hephaestion; but soon after changed his mind again, 
<A NAME="41"></A>and was angry with Eumenes, and accounted the freedom he had taken to be 
<A NAME="42"></A>rather an affront to the king than a reflection upon Hephaestion. Afterwards, 
<A NAME="43"></A>when Nearchus, with a fleet, was to be sent to the Southern Sea, Alexander 
<A NAME="44"></A>borrowed money of his friends, his own treasury being exhausted, and would 
<A NAME="45"></A>have had three hundred talents of Eumenes, but he sent a hundred only, 
<A NAME="46"></A>pretending that it was not without great difficulty he had raised so much 
<A NAME="47"></A>from his stewards. Alexander neither complained nor took the money, but 
<A NAME="48"></A>gave private orders to set Eumenes's tent on fire, designing to take him 
<A NAME="49"></A>in a manifest lie, when his money was carried out. But before that could 
<A NAME="50"></A>be done the tent was consumed, and Alexander repented of his orders, all 
<A NAME="51"></A>his papers being burnt; the gold and silver, however, which was melted 
<A NAME="52"></A>down in the fire, being afterwards collected, was found to be more than 
<A NAME="53"></A>one thousand talents; yet Alexander took none of it, and only wrote to 
<A NAME="54"></A>the several governors and generals to send new copies of the papers that 
<A NAME="55"></A>were burnt, and ordered them to be delivered to Eumenes.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR>Another difference happened between him and Hephaestion concerning 
<A NAME="57"></A>a gift, and a great deal of ill language passed between them, yet Eumenes 
<A NAME="58"></A>still continued in favour. But Hephaestion dying soon after, the king, 
<A NAME="59"></A>in his grief, presuming all those that differed with Hephaestion in his 
<A NAME="60"></A>lifetime were now rejoicing at his death, showed much harshness and severity 
<A NAME="61"></A>in his behaviour with them, especially towards Eumenes, whom he often upbraided 
<A NAME="62"></A>with his quarrels and ill language to Hephaestion. But he, being a wise 
<A NAME="63"></A>and dexterous courtier, made advantage of what had done him prejudice, 
<A NAME="64"></A>and struck in with the king's passion for glorifying his friend's memory, 
<A NAME="65"></A>suggesting various plans to do him honour, and contributing largely and 
<A NAME="66"></A>readily towards erecting his monument.
<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR>After Alexander's death, when the quarrel broke out between the 
<A NAME="68"></A>troops of the phalanx and the officers, his companions, Eumenes, though 
<A NAME="69"></A>in his judgment he inclined to the latter, yet in his professions stood 
<A NAME="70"></A>neuter, as if he thought it unbecoming him, who was a stranger, to interpose 
<A NAME="71"></A>in the private quarrels of the Macedonians. When the rest of Alexander's 
<A NAME="72"></A>friends left Babylon, he stayed behind, and did much to pacify the foot-soldiers, 
<A NAME="73"></A>and to dispose them towards an accommodation. And when the officers had 
<A NAME="74"></A>agreed among themselves, and, recovering from the first disorder proceeded 
<A NAME="75"></A>to share out the several commands and provinces, they made Eumenes governor 
<A NAME="76"></A>of Cappadocia and Paphlagonia, and all the coast upon the Pontic Sea as 
<A NAME="77"></A>far as Trebizond, which at that time was not subject to the Macedonians, 
<A NAME="78"></A>for Ariarathes kept it as king, but Leonnatus and Antigonus, with a large 
<A NAME="79"></A>army, were to put him in possession of it.
<A NAME="80"></A><BR><BR>Antigonus, already filled with hopes of his own, and despising 
<A NAME="81"></A>all men, took no notice of Perdiccas's letter; but Leonnatus with his army 
<A NAME="82"></A>came down into Phrygia to the service of Eumenes. But being visited by 
<A NAME="83"></A>Hecataeus, the tyrant of the Cardians, and requested rather to relieve 
<A NAME="84"></A>Antipater and the Macedonians that were besieged in Lamia, he resolved 
<A NAME="85"></A>upon that expedition, inviting Eumenes to a share in it, and endeavouring 
<A NAME="86"></A>to reconcile him to Hecataeus. For there was an hereditary feud between 
<A NAME="87"></A>them, arising out of political differences, and Eumenes had more than once 
<A NAME="88"></A>been known to denounce Hecataeus as a tyrant, and to exhort Alexander to 
<A NAME="89"></A>restore the Cardians their liberty. Therefore at this time, also, he declined 
<A NAME="90"></A>the expedition proposed, pretending that he feared lest Antipater, who 
<A NAME="91"></A>already hated him, should for that reason, and to gratify Hecataeus, kill 
<A NAME="92"></A>him. Leonnatus so far believed as to impart to Eumenes his whole design, 
<A NAME="93"></A>which, as he had pretended and given out, was to aid Antipater, but in 
<A NAME="94"></A>truth was to seize the kingdom of Macedon; and he showed him letters from 
<A NAME="95"></A>Cleopatra, in which, it appeared, she invited him to Pella, with promises 
<A NAME="96"></A>to marry him. But Eumenes, whether fearing Antipater, or looking upon Leonnatus 
<A NAME="97"></A>as a rash, headstrong, and unsafe man, stole away from him by night, taking 
<A NAME="98"></A>with him all his men, namely, three hundred horse, and two hundred of his 
<A NAME="99"></A>own servants armed, and all his gold, to the value of five thousand talents 
<A NAME="100"></A>of silver, and fled to Perdiccas, discovered to him Leonnatus's design, 
<A NAME="101"></A>and thus gained great interest with him, and was made of the council. Soon 
<A NAME="102"></A>after, Perdiccas, with a great army, which he led himself, conducted Eumenes 
<A NAME="103"></A>into Cappadocia, and, having taken Ariarathes prisoner, and subdued the 
<A NAME="104"></A>whole country, declared him governor of it. He accordingly proceeded to 
<A NAME="105"></A>dispose of the chief cities among his own friends, and made captains of 
<A NAME="106"></A>garrisons, judges, receivers, and other officers, of such as he thought 
<A NAME="107"></A>fit himself, Perdiccas not at all interposing. Eumenes, however, still 
<A NAME="108"></A>continued to attend upon Perdiccas, both out of respect to him, and a desire 
<A NAME="109"></A>not to be absent from the royal family.
<A NAME="110"></A><BR><BR>But Perdiccas, believing he was able enough to attain his own further 
<A NAME="111"></A>objects without assistance, and that the country he left behind him might 
<A NAME="112"></A>stand in need of an active and faithful governor, when he came into Cilicia 
<A NAME="113"></A>dismissed Eumenes, under colour of sending him to his command, but in truth 
<A NAME="114"></A>to secure Armenia, which was on its frontier, and was unsettled through 
<A NAME="115"></A>the practices of Neoptolemus. Him, a proud and vain man, Eumenes exerted 
<A NAME="116"></A>himself to gain by personal attentions; but to balance the Macedonian foot, 
<A NAME="117"></A>whom he found insolent and self-willed, he contrived to raise an army of 
<A NAME="118"></A>horse, excusing from tax and contribution all those of the country that 
<A NAME="119"></A>were able to serve on horseback, and buying up a number of horses, which 
<A NAME="120"></A>he distributed among such of his own men as he most confided in, stimulating 
<A NAME="121"></A>the courage of his new soldiers by gifts and honours, and inuring their 
<A NAME="122"></A>bodies to service by frequent marching and exercising; so that the Macedonians 
<A NAME="123"></A>were some of them astonished, others overjoyed to see that in so short 
<A NAME="124"></A>a time he had got together a body of no less than six thousand three hundred 
<A NAME="125"></A>horsemen.
<A NAME="126"></A><BR><BR>But when Craterus and Antipater, having subdued the Greeks, advanced 
<A NAME="127"></A>into Asia, with intentions to quell the power of Perdiccas, and were reported 
<A NAME="128"></A>to design an invasion of Cappadocia, Perdiccas, resolving himself to march 
<A NAME="129"></A>against Ptolemy, made Eumenes commander-in-chief of all the forces of Armenia 
<A NAME="130"></A>and Cappadocia, and to that purpose wrote letters, requiring Alcetas and 
<A NAME="131"></A>Neoptolemus to be obedient to Eumenes, and giving full commission to Eumenes 
<A NAME="132"></A>to dispose and order all things as he thought fit. Alcetas flatly refused 
<A NAME="133"></A>to serve, because his Macedonians, he said were ashamed to fight against 
<A NAME="134"></A>Antipater, and loved Craterus so well, they were ready to receive him for 
<A NAME="135"></A>their commander. Neoptolemus designed treachery against Eumenes, but was 
<A NAME="136"></A>discovered; and being summoned, refused to obey, and put himself in a posture 
<A NAME="137"></A>of defence. Here Eumenes first found the benefit of his own foresight and 
<A NAME="138"></A>contrivance, for his foot being beaten, he routed Neoptolemus with his 
<A NAME="139"></A>horse, and took all his baggage; and coming up with his whole force upon 
<A NAME="140"></A>the phalanx while broken and disordered in its flight, obliged the men 
<A NAME="141"></A>to lay down their arms and take an oath to serve under him. Neoptolemus, 
<A NAME="142"></A>with some few stragglers whom he rallied, fled to Craterus and Antipater. 
<A NAME="143"></A>From them had come an embassy to Eumenes, inviting him over to their side, 
<A NAME="144"></A>offering to secure him in his present government and to give him additional 
<A NAME="145"></A>command, both of men and of territory, with the advantage of gaining his 
<A NAME="146"></A>enemy Antipater to become his friend, and keeping Craterus his friend from 
<A NAME="147"></A>turning to be his enemy. To which Eumenes replied that he could not so 
<A NAME="148"></A>suddenly be reconciled to his old enemy Antipater, especially at a time 
<A NAME="149"></A>when he saw him use his friends like enemies, but was ready to reconcile 
<A NAME="150"></A>Craterus to Perdiccas, upon any and equitable terms; but in case of any 
<A NAME="151"></A>aggression, he would resist the injustice to his last breath, and would 
<A NAME="152"></A>rather lose his life than betray his word.
<A NAME="153"></A><BR><BR>Antipater, receiving this answer, took time to consider upon the 
<A NAME="154"></A>whole matter; when Neoptolemus arrived from his defeat and acquainted them 
<A NAME="155"></A>with the ill success of his arms, and urged them to give him assistance, 
<A NAME="156"></A>to come, both of them if possible, but Craterus at any rate, for the Macedonians 
<A NAME="157"></A>loved him so excessively, that if they saw but his hat, or heard his voice, 
<A NAME="158"></A>they would all pass over in a body with their arms. And in truth Craterus 
<A NAME="159"></A>had a mighty name among them, and the soldiers after Alexander's death 
<A NAME="160"></A>were extremely fond of him, remembering how he had often for their sakes 
<A NAME="161"></A>incurred Alexander's displeasure, doing his best to withhold him when he 
<A NAME="162"></A>began to follow the Persian fashions, and always maintaining the customs 
<A NAME="163"></A>of his country, when, through pride and luxuriousness, they began to be 
<A NAME="164"></A>disregarded. Craterus, therefore, sent on Antipater into Cilicia, and himself 
<A NAME="165"></A>and Neoptolemus marched with a large division of the army against Eumenes; 
<A NAME="166"></A>expecting to come upon him unawares, and to find his army disordered with 
<A NAME="167"></A>revelling after the late victory. Now that Eumenes should suspect his coming, 
<A NAME="168"></A>and be prepared to receive him, is an argument of his vigilance, but not 
<A NAME="169"></A>perhaps a proof of any extraordinary sagacity, but that he should contrive 
<A NAME="170"></A>both to conceal from his enemies the disadvantages of his position, and 
<A NAME="171"></A>from his own men whom they were to fight with, so that he led them on against 
<A NAME="172"></A>Craterus himself, without their knowing that he commanded the enemy, this, 
<A NAME="173"></A>indeed, seems to show peculiar address and skill in the general. He gave 
<A NAME="174"></A>out that Neoptolemus and Pigres were approaching with some Cappadocian 
<A NAME="175"></A>and Paphlagonian horse. And at night, having resolved on marching, he fell 
<A NAME="176"></A>asleep, and had an extraordinary dream. For he thought he saw two Alexanders 
<A NAME="177"></A>ready to engage, each commanding his several phalanx, the one assisted 
<A NAME="178"></A>by Minerva, the other by Ceres; and that after a hot dispute, he on whose 
<A NAME="179"></A>side Minerva was, was beaten, and Ceres, gathering ears of corn, wove them 
<A NAME="180"></A>into a crown for the victor.
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR>This vision Eumenes interpreted at once as boding success to himself, 
<A NAME="182"></A>who was to fight for a fruitful country, and at that very time covered 
<A NAME="183"></A>with the young ears, the whole being sown with corn, and the fields so 
<A NAME="184"></A>thick with it that they made a beautiful show of a long peace. And he was 
<A NAME="185"></A>further emboldened when he understood that the enemy's password was Minerva 
<A NAME="186"></A>and Alexander. Accordingly he also gave out as his Ceres and Alexander, 
<A NAME="187"></A>and gave his men orders to make garlands for themselves, and to dress their 
<A NAME="188"></A>arms with wreaths of corn. He found himself under many temptations to discover 
<A NAME="189"></A>to his captains and officers whom they were to engage with, and not to 
<A NAME="190"></A>conceal a secret of such moment in his own breast alone, yet he kept to 
<A NAME="191"></A>his first resolutions, and ventured to run the hazard of his own 
<A NAME="192"></A>judgment.
<A NAME="193"></A><BR><BR>When he came to give battle, he would not trust any Macedonian 
<A NAME="194"></A>to engage Craterus, but appointed two troops of foreign horse, commanded 
<A NAME="195"></A>by Pharnabazus, son to Artabazus, and Phoenix of Tenedos, with order to 
<A NAME="196"></A>charge as soon as ever they saw the enemy, without giving them leisure 
<A NAME="197"></A>to speak or retire, or receiving any herald or trumpet from them. For he 
<A NAME="198"></A>was exceedingly afraid about his Macedonians, lest, if they found out Craterus 
<A NAME="199"></A>to be there, they should go over to his side. He himself, with three hundred 
<A NAME="200"></A>of his best horse, led the right wing against Neoptolemus. When having 
<A NAME="201"></A>passed a little hill they came in view, and were seen advancing with more 
<A NAME="202"></A>than ordinary briskness, Craterus was amazed, and bitterly reproached Neoptolemus 
<A NAME="203"></A>for deceiving him with hopes of the Macedonians' revolt, but he encouraged 
<A NAME="204"></A>his men to do bravely, and forthwith charged.
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR>The first engagement was very fierce, and the spears being soon 
<A NAME="206"></A>broken to pieces, they came to close fighting with their swords; and here 
<A NAME="207"></A>Craterus did by no means dishonour Alexander, but slew many of his enemies 
<A NAME="208"></A>and repulsed many assaults, but at last received a wound in his side from 
<A NAME="209"></A>a Thracian, and fell off his horse. Being down, many not knowing him went 
<A NAME="210"></A>past him, but Gorgias, one of Eumenes's captains, knew him, and alighting 
<A NAME="211"></A>from his horse kept guard over him as he lay badly wounded and slowly dying. 
<A NAME="212"></A>In the meantime Neoptolemus and Eumenes were engaged; who, being inveterate 
<A NAME="213"></A>and mortal enemies, sought for one another, but missed for the two first 
<A NAME="214"></A>courses, but in the third discovering one another, they drew their swords, 
<A NAME="215"></A>and with loud shouts immediately charged. And their horses striking against 
<A NAME="216"></A>one another like two galleys, they quitted their reins, and taking mutual 
<A NAME="217"></A>hold pulled at one another's helmets, and at the armour from their shoulders. 
<A NAME="218"></A>While they were thus struggling, their horses went from under them, and 
<A NAME="219"></A>they fell together to the ground, there again still keeping their hold 
<A NAME="220"></A>and wrestling. Neoptolemus was getting up first, but Eumenes wounded him 
<A NAME="221"></A>in the ham, and got upon his feet before him. Neoptolemus supporting himself 
<A NAME="222"></A>upon one knee, the other leg being disabled, and himself undermost, fought 
<A NAME="223"></A>courageously, though his blows were not mortal, but receiving a stroke 
<A NAME="224"></A>in the neck he fell and ceased to resist. Eumenes, transported with passion 
<A NAME="225"></A>and his inveterate hatred to him, fell to reviling and stripping him, and 
<A NAME="226"></A>perceived not that his sword was still in his hand. And with this he wounded 
<A NAME="227"></A>Eumenes under the bottom of his corslet in the groin, but in truth more 
<A NAME="228"></A>frightened than hurt him; his blow being faint for want of strength. Having 
<A NAME="229"></A>stript the dead body, ill as he was with the wounds he had received in 
<A NAME="230"></A>his legs and arms, he took horse again, and hurried towards the left wing 
<A NAME="231"></A>of his army, which he supposed to be still engaged. Hearing of the death 
<A NAME="232"></A>of Craterus, he rode up to him, and finding there was yet some life in 
<A NAME="233"></A>him, alighted from his horse and wept, and laying his right hand upon him, 
<A NAME="234"></A>inveighed bitterly against Neoptolemus, and lamented both Craterus's misfortune 
<A NAME="235"></A>and his own hard fate, that he should be necessitated to engage against 
<A NAME="236"></A>an old friend and acquaintance, and either do or suffer so much 
<A NAME="237"></A>mischief.
<A NAME="238"></A><BR><BR>This victory Eumenes obtained about ten days after the former, 
<A NAME="239"></A>and got great reputation alike for his conduct and his valour in achieving 
<A NAME="240"></A>it. But, on the other hand, it created him great envy both among his own 
<A NAME="241"></A>troops and his enemies that he, a stranger and a foreigner, should employ 
<A NAME="242"></A>the forces and arms of Macedon to cut off the bravest and most approved 
<A NAME="243"></A>man among them. Had the news of this defeat come timely enough to Perdiccas, 
<A NAME="244"></A>he had doubtless been the greatest of all the Macedonians; but now, he 
<A NAME="245"></A>being slain in a mutiny in Egypt, two days before the news arrived, the 
<A NAME="246"></A>Macedonians in a rage decreed Eumenes's death, giving joint commission 
<A NAME="247"></A>to Antigonus and Antipater to prosecute the war against 
<A NAME="248"></A>him.
<A NAME="249"></A><BR><BR>Passing by Mount Ida, where there was a royal establishment of 
<A NAME="250"></A>horses, Eumenes took as many as he had occasion for, and sent an account 
<A NAME="251"></A>of his doing so to the overseers, at which Antipater is said to have laughed, 
<A NAME="252"></A>calling it truly laudable in Eumenes thus to hold himself prepared for 
<A NAME="253"></A>giving in to them (or would it be taking from them?) strict account of 
<A NAME="254"></A>all matters of administration. Eumenes had designed to engage in the plains 
<A NAME="255"></A>of Lydia, near Sardis, both because his chief strength lay in horse, and 
<A NAME="256"></A>to let Cleopatra see how powerful he was. But at her particular request, 
<A NAME="257"></A>for she was afraid to give any umbrage to Antipater, he marched into the 
<A NAME="258"></A>upper Phrygia, and wintered in Celaenae; when Alcetas, Polemon, and Docimus 
<A NAME="259"></A>disputing with him who should command in chief, "You know," said he, "the 
<A NAME="260"></A>old saying: That destruction regards no punctilios." Having promised his 
<A NAME="261"></A>soldiers pay within three days, he sold them all the farms and castles 
<A NAME="262"></A>in the country, together with the men and beasts with which they were filled; 
<A NAME="263"></A>every captain or officer that bought received from Eumenes the use of his 
<A NAME="264"></A>engines to storm the place, and divided the spoils among his company, proportionably 
<A NAME="265"></A>to every man's arrears. By this Eumenes came again to be popular, so that 
<A NAME="266"></A>when letters were found thrown about the camp by the enemy promising one 
<A NAME="267"></A>hundred talents, besides great honours, to any one that should kill Eumenes, 
<A NAME="268"></A>the Macedonians were extremely offended, and made an order that from that 
<A NAME="269"></A>time forward one thousand of their best men should continually guard his 
<A NAME="270"></A>person, and keep strict watch about him by night in their several turns. 
<A NAME="271"></A>This order was cheerfully obeyed, and they gladly received of Eumenes the 
<A NAME="272"></A>same honours which the kings used to confer upon their favourites. He now 
<A NAME="273"></A>had leave to bestow purple hats and cloaks, which among the Macedonians 
<A NAME="274"></A>is one of the greatest honours the king can give.
<A NAME="275"></A><BR><BR>Good fortune will elevate even petty minds, and give them the appearance 
<A NAME="276"></A>of a certain greatness and stateliness, as from their high place they look 
<A NAME="277"></A>down upon the world; but the truly noble and resolved spirit raises itself, 
<A NAME="278"></A>and becomes more conspicuous in times of disaster and ill fortune, as was 
<A NAME="279"></A>now the case with Eumenes. For having by the treason of one of his own 
<A NAME="280"></A>men lost the field to Antigonus at Orcynii, in Cappadocia, in his flight 
<A NAME="281"></A>he gave the traitor no opportunity to escape to the enemy, but immediately 
<A NAME="282"></A>seized and hanged him. Then in his flight, taking a contrary course to 
<A NAME="283"></A>his pursuers, he stole by them unawares, returned to the place where the 
<A NAME="284"></A>battle had been fought, and encamped. There he gathered up the dead bodies 
<A NAME="285"></A>and burnt them with the doors and windows of the neighbouring villages, 
<A NAME="286"></A>and raised heaps of earth upon their graves; insomuch that Antigonus, who 
<A NAME="287"></A>came thither soon after, expressed his astonishment at his courage and 
<A NAME="288"></A>firm resolution. Falling afterwards upon the baggage of Antigonus, he might 
<A NAME="289"></A>easily have taken many captives, both bond and freemen, and much wealth 
<A NAME="290"></A>collected from the spoils of so many wars; but he feared lest his men, 
<A NAME="291"></A>overladen with so much booty, might become unfit for rapid retreat, and 
<A NAME="292"></A>too fond of their ease to sustain the continual marches and endure the 
<A NAME="293"></A>long waiting on which he depended for success, expecting to tire Antigonus 
<A NAME="294"></A>into some other course. But then considering it would be extremely difficult 
<A NAME="295"></A>to restrain the Macedonians from plunder, when it seemed to offer itself, 
<A NAME="296"></A>he gave them order to refresh themselves, and bait their horses, and then 
<A NAME="297"></A>attack the enemy. In the meantime he sent privately to Menander, who had 
<A NAME="298"></A>care of all this baggage, professing a concern for him upon the score of 
<A NAME="299"></A>old friendship and acquaintance; and therefore advising him to quit the 
<A NAME="300"></A>plain and secure himself upon the sides of the neighbouring hills, where 
<A NAME="301"></A>the horse might not be able to hem him in. When Menander, sensible of his 
<A NAME="302"></A>danger, had speedily packed up his goods and decamped, Eumenes openly sent 
<A NAME="303"></A>his scouts to discover the enemy's posture, and commanded his men to arm 
<A NAME="304"></A>and bridle their horses, as designing immediately to give battle; but the 
<A NAME="305"></A>scouts returning with news that Menander had secured so difficult a post 
<A NAME="306"></A>it was impossible to take him, Eumenes, pretending to be grieved with the 
<A NAME="307"></A>disappointment, drew off his men another way. It is said that when Menander 
<A NAME="308"></A>reported this afterwards to Antigonus, and the Macedonians commended Eumenes, 
<A NAME="309"></A>imputing it to his singular good-nature, that having it in his power to 
<A NAME="310"></A>make slaves of their children and outrage their wives he forbore and spared 
<A NAME="311"></A>them all, Antigonus replied, "Alas, good friends, he had no regard to us, 
<A NAME="312"></A>but to himself, being loath to wear so many shackles when he designed to 
<A NAME="313"></A>fly."
<A NAME="314"></A><BR><BR>From this time Eumenes, daily flying and wandering about, persuaded 
<A NAME="315"></A>many of his men to disband, whether out of kindness to them, or unwillingness 
<A NAME="316"></A>to lead about such a body of men as were too few to engage and too many 
<A NAME="317"></A>to fly undiscovered. Taking refuge at Nora, a place on the confines of 
<A NAME="318"></A>Lycaonia and Cappadocia, with five hundred horse and two hundred heavy-armed 
<A NAME="319"></A>foot, he again dismissed as many of his friends as desired it, through 
<A NAME="320"></A>fear of the probable hardships to be encountered there, and embracing them 
<A NAME="321"></A>with all demonstrations of kindness gave them licence to depart. Antigonus, 
<A NAME="322"></A>when he came before this fort, desired to have an interview with Eumenes 
<A NAME="323"></A>before the siege; but he returned answer that Antigonus had many friends 
<A NAME="324"></A>who might command in his room; but they whom Eumenes defended had nobody 
<A NAME="325"></A>to substitute if he should miscarry; therefore, if Antigonus thought it 
<A NAME="326"></A>worth while to treat with him, he should first send him hostages. And when 
<A NAME="327"></A>Antigonus required that Eumenes should first address himself to him as 
<A NAME="328"></A>his superior, he replied, "While I am able to wield a sword, I shall think 
<A NAME="329"></A>no man greater than myself." At last, when, according to Eumenes's demand, 
<A NAME="330"></A>Antigonus sent his own nephew Ptolemy to the fort, Eumenes went out to 
<A NAME="331"></A>him, and they mutually embraced with great tenderness and friendship, as 
<A NAME="332"></A>having formerly been very intimate. After long conversation, Eumenes making 
<A NAME="333"></A>no mention of his own pardon and security, but requiring that he should 
<A NAME="334"></A>be confirmed in his several governments, and restitution be made him of 
<A NAME="335"></A>the rewards of his service, all that were present were astonished at his 
<A NAME="336"></A>courage and gallantry. And many of the Macedonians flocked to see what 
<A NAME="337"></A>sort of person Eumenes was, for since the death of Craterus no man had 
<A NAME="338"></A>been so much talked of in the army. But Antigonus, being afraid lest he 
<A NAME="339"></A>might suffer some violence, first commanded the soldiers to keep off, calling 
<A NAME="340"></A>out and throwing stones at those who pressed forwards. At last, taking 
<A NAME="341"></A>Eumenes in his arms, and keeping off the crowd with his guards, not without 
<A NAME="342"></A>great difficulty, he returned him safe into the fort.
<A NAME="343"></A><BR><BR>Then Antigonus, having built a wall round Nora, left a force sufficient 
<A NAME="344"></A>to carry on the siege, and drew off the rest of his army; and Eumenes was 
<A NAME="345"></A>beleaguered and kept garrison, having plenty of corn and water and salt, 
<A NAME="346"></A>but no other thing, either for food or delicacy; yet with such as he had, 
<A NAME="347"></A>he kept a cheerful table for his friends, inviting them severally in their 
<A NAME="348"></A>turns, and seasoning his entertainment with a gentle and affable behaviour. 
<A NAME="349"></A>For he had a pleasant countenance, and looked not like an old and practised 
<A NAME="350"></A>soldier, but was smooth and florid, and his shape as delicate as if his 
<A NAME="351"></A>limbs had been carved by art in the most accurate proportions. He was not 
<A NAME="352"></A>a great orator, but winning and persuasive, as may be seen in his 
<A NAME="353"></A>letters.
<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR>The greatest distress of the besieged was the narrowness of the 
<A NAME="355"></A>place they were in, their quarters being very confined, and the whole place 
<A NAME="356"></A>but two furlongs in compass; so that both they and their horses fed without 
<A NAME="357"></A>exercise. Accordingly, not only to prevent the listlessness of such inactive 
<A NAME="358"></A>living, but to have them in condition to fly if occasion required, he assigned 
<A NAME="359"></A>a room one-and-twenty feet long, the largest in all the fort, for the men 
<A NAME="360"></A>to walk in, directing them to begin their walk gently, and so gradually 
<A NAME="361"></A>mend their pace. And for the horses, he tied them to the roof with great 
<A NAME="362"></A>halters, fastening which about their necks, with a pulley he gently raised 
<A NAME="363"></A>them, till standing upon the ground with their hinder feet, they just touched 
<A NAME="364"></A>it with the very ends of their forefeet. In this posture the grooms plied 
<A NAME="365"></A>them with whips and shouts, provoking them to curvet and kick out with 
<A NAME="366"></A>their hind legs, struggling and stamping at the same time to find support 
<A NAME="367"></A>for their forefeet, and thus their whole body was exercised, till they 
<A NAME="368"></A>were all in a foam and sweat; excellent exercise, whether for strength 
<A NAME="369"></A>or speed; and then he gave them their corn already coarsely ground, that 
<A NAME="370"></A>they might sooner despatch and better digest it.
<A NAME="371"></A><BR><BR>The siege continuing long, Antigonus received advice that Antipater 
<A NAME="372"></A>was dead in Macedon, and that affairs were embroiled by the differences 
<A NAME="373"></A>of Cassander and Polysperchon, upon which he conceived no mean hopes, purposing 
<A NAME="374"></A>to make himself master of all, and, in order to his design, thought to 
<A NAME="375"></A>bring over Eumenes, that he might have his advice and assistance. He, therefore, 
<A NAME="376"></A>sent Hieronymus to treat with him, proposing a certain oath, which Eumenes 
<A NAME="377"></A>first corrected, and then referred himself to the Macedonians themselves 
<A NAME="378"></A>that besieged him, to be judged by them, which of the two forms was the 
<A NAME="379"></A>most equitable. Antigonus in the beginning of his had slightly mentioned 
<A NAME="380"></A>the kings as by way of ceremony, while all the sequel referred to himself 
<A NAME="381"></A>alone; but Eumenes changed the form of it to Olympias and the kings, and 
<A NAME="382"></A>proceeded to swear not to be true to Antigonus, only, but to them, and 
<A NAME="383"></A>have the same friends and enemies, not with Antigonus, but with Olympias 
<A NAME="384"></A>and the kings. This form the Macedonians thinking the more reasonable, 
<A NAME="385"></A>swore Eumenes according to it, and raised the siege, sending also to Antigonus 
<A NAME="386"></A>that he should swear in the same form to Eumenes. Meantime, all the hostages 
<A NAME="387"></A>of the Cappadocians Eumenes had in Nora he returned, obtaining from their 
<A NAME="388"></A>friends war-horses, beasts of carriage, and tents in exchange. And collecting 
<A NAME="389"></A>again all the soldiers who had dispersed at the time of his flight, and 
<A NAME="390"></A>were now wandering about the country, he got together a body of near a 
<A NAME="391"></A>thousand horse, and with them fled from Antigonus, whom he justly feared. 
<A NAME="392"></A>For he had sent orders not only to have him blocked up and besieged again, 
<A NAME="393"></A>but had given a very sharp answer to the Macedonians for admitting Eumenes's 
<A NAME="394"></A>amendment of the oath.
<A NAME="395"></A><BR><BR>While Eumenes was flying, he received letters from those in Macedonia, 
<A NAME="396"></A>who were jealous of Antigonus's greatness, from Olympias, inviting him 
<A NAME="397"></A>thither to take the charge and protection of Alexander's infant son, whose 
<A NAME="398"></A>person was in danger, and other letters from Polysperchon and Philip the 
<A NAME="399"></A>king, requiring him to make war upon Antigonus, as general of the forces 
<A NAME="400"></A>in Cappadocia, and empowering him out of the treasure at Quinda to take 
<A NAME="401"></A>five hundred talents' compensation for his own losses, and to levy as much 
<A NAME="402"></A>as he thought necessary to carry on the war. They wrote also to the same 
<A NAME="403"></A>effect to Antigenes and Teutamus, the chief officers of the Argyraspids; 
<A NAME="404"></A>who, on receiving these letters, treated Eumenes with a show of respect 
<A NAME="405"></A>and kindness; but it was apparent enough that they were full of envy and 
<A NAME="406"></A>emulation, disdaining to give place to him. Their envy Eumenes moderated 
<A NAME="407"></A>by refusing to accept the money, as if he had not needed it; and their 
<A NAME="408"></A>ambition and emulation, who were neither able to govern nor willing to 
<A NAME="409"></A>obey, he conquered by help of superstition. For he told them that Alexander 
<A NAME="410"></A>had appeared to him in a dream, and showed him a regal pavilion richly 
<A NAME="411"></A>furnished, with a throne in it; and told him if they would sit in council 
<A NAME="412"></A>there, he himself would be present, and prosper all the consultations and 
<A NAME="413"></A>actions upon which they should enter in his name. Antigenes and Teutamus 
<A NAME="414"></A>were easily prevailed upon to believe this, being as little willing to 
<A NAME="415"></A>come and consult Eumenes as he himself was to be seen waiting at other 
<A NAME="416"></A>men's doors. Accordingly, they erected a tent royal, and a throne, called 
<A NAME="417"></A>Alexander's, and there they met to consult upon all affairs of 
<A NAME="418"></A>moment.
<A NAME="419"></A><BR><BR>Afterwards they advanced into the interior of Asia, and in their 
<A NAME="420"></A>march met with Peucestes, who was friendly to them and with the other satraps, 
<A NAME="421"></A>who joined forces with them, and greatly encouraged the Macedonians with 
<A NAME="422"></A>the number and appearance of their men. But they themselves, having since 
<A NAME="423"></A>Alexander's decease become imperious and ungoverned in their tempers, and 
<A NAME="424"></A>luxurious in their daily habits, imagining themselves great princes, and 
<A NAME="425"></A>pampered in their conceit by the flattery of the barbarians, when all these 
<A NAME="426"></A>conflicting pretensions now came together, were soon found to be exacting 
<A NAME="427"></A>and quarrelsome one with another, while all alike unmeasurably flattered 
<A NAME="428"></A>the Macedonians, giving them money for revels and sacrifices, till in a 
<A NAME="429"></A>short time they brought the camp to be a dissolute place of entertainment, 
<A NAME="430"></A>and the army a mere multitude of voters, canvassed as in a democracy for 
<A NAME="431"></A>the election of this or that commander. Eumenes, perceiving they despised 
<A NAME="432"></A>one another, and all of them feared him, and sought an opportunity to kill 
<A NAME="433"></A>him, pretended to be in want of money, and borrowed many talents, of those 
<A NAME="434"></A>especially who most hated him, to make them at once confide in him and 
<A NAME="435"></A>forbear all violence to him for fear of losing their own money. Thus his 
<A NAME="436"></A>enemies' estates were the guard of his person, and by receiving money he 
<A NAME="437"></A>purchased safety, for which it is more common to give 
<A NAME="438"></A>it.
<A NAME="439"></A><BR><BR>The Macedonians, also, while there was no show of danger, allowed 
<A NAME="440"></A>themselves to be corrupted, and made all their court to those who gave 
<A NAME="441"></A>them presents, who had their body-guards, and affected to appear generals-in-chief. 
<A NAME="442"></A>But when Antigonus came upon them with a great army, and their affairs 
<A NAME="443"></A>themselves seemed to call out for a true general, then not only the common 
<A NAME="444"></A>soldiers cast their eyes upon Eumenes, but these men, who had appeared 
<A NAME="445"></A>so great in a peaceful time of ease, submitted all of them to him, and 
<A NAME="446"></A>quietly posted themselves severally as he appointed them. And when Antigonus 
<A NAME="447"></A>attempted to pass the river Pasitigris, all the rest that were appointed 
<A NAME="448"></A>to guard the passes were not so much as aware of his march; only Eumenes 
<A NAME="449"></A>met and encountered him, slew many of his men, and filled the river with 
<A NAME="450"></A>the dead, and took four thousand prisoners. But it was most particularly 
<A NAME="451"></A>when Eumenes was sick that the Macedonians let it be seen how in their 
<A NAME="452"></A>judgment, while others could feast them handsomely and make entertainments, 
<A NAME="453"></A>he alone knew how to fight and lead an army. For Peucestes, having made 
<A NAME="454"></A>a splendid entertainment in Persia, and given each of the soldiers a sheep 
<A NAME="455"></A>to sacrifice with, made himself sure of being commander-in-chief. Some 
<A NAME="456"></A>few days after the army was to march, and Eumenes having been dangerously 
<A NAME="457"></A>ill was carried in a litter apart from the body of the army, that any rest 
<A NAME="458"></A>he got might not be disturbed. But when they were a little advanced, unexpectedly 
<A NAME="459"></A>they had a view of the enemy, who had passed the hills that lay between 
<A NAME="460"></A>them, and was marching down into the plain. At the sight of the golden 
<A NAME="461"></A>armour glittering in the sun as they marched down in their order, the elephants 
<A NAME="462"></A>with their castles on their backs, and the men in their purple, as their 
<A NAME="463"></A>manner was when they were going to give battle, the front stopped their 
<A NAME="464"></A>march, and called out for Eumenes, for they would not advance a step but 
<A NAME="465"></A>under his conduct; and fixing their arms in the ground gave the word among 
<A NAME="466"></A>themselves to stand, requiring their officers also not to stir or engage 
<A NAME="467"></A>or hazard themselves without Eumenes. News of this being brought to Eumenes, 
<A NAME="468"></A>he hastened those that carried his litter, and drawing back the curtains 
<A NAME="469"></A>on both sides, joyfully put forth his right hand. As soon as the soldiers 
<A NAME="470"></A>saw him they saluted him in their Macedonian dialect, and took up their 
<A NAME="471"></A>shields, and striking them with their pikes, gave a great shout; inviting 
<A NAME="472"></A>the enemy to come on, for now they had a leader.
<A NAME="473"></A><BR><BR>Antigonus understanding by some prisoners he had taken that Eumenes 
<A NAME="474"></A>was out of health, to that degree that he was carried in a litter, presumed 
<A NAME="475"></A>it would be no hard matter to crush the rest of them, since he was ill. 
<A NAME="476"></A>He therefore made the greater haste to come up with them and engage. But 
<A NAME="477"></A>being come so near as to discover how the enemy was drawn up and appointed, 
<A NAME="478"></A>he was astonished, and paused for some time; at last he saw the litter 
<A NAME="479"></A>carrying from one wing of the army to the other, and, as his manner was, 
<A NAME="480"></A>laughing aloud, he said to his friends, "That litter there, it seems, is 
<A NAME="481"></A>the thing that offers us battle;" and immediately wheeled about, retired 
<A NAME="482"></A>with all his army, and pitched his camp. The men on the other side, finding 
<A NAME="483"></A>a little respite, returned to their former habits, and allowing themselves 
<A NAME="484"></A>to be flattered, and making the most of the indulgence of their generals, 
<A NAME="485"></A>took up for their winter quarters near the whole country of the Gabeni, 
<A NAME="486"></A>so that the front was quartered nearly a thousand furlongs from the rear; 
<A NAME="487"></A>which Antigonus understanding, marched suddenly towards them, taking the 
<A NAME="488"></A>most difficult road through a country that wanted water; but the way was 
<A NAME="489"></A>short though uneven; hoping, if he should surprise them thus scattered 
<A NAME="490"></A>in their winter quarters, the soldiers would not easily be able to come 
<A NAME="491"></A>up in time enough and join with their officers. But having to pass through 
<A NAME="492"></A>a country uninhabited, where he met with violent winds and severe frosts, 
<A NAME="493"></A>he was much checked in his march, and his men suffered exceedingly. The 
<A NAME="494"></A>only possible relief was making numerous fires, by which his enemies got 
<A NAME="495"></A>notice of his coming. For the barbarians who dwelt on the mountains overlooking 
<A NAME="496"></A>the desert, amazed at the multitude of fires they saw, sent messengers 
<A NAME="497"></A>upon dromedaries to acquaint Peucestes. He being astonished and almost 
<A NAME="498"></A>out of his senses with the news, and finding the rest in no less disorder, 
<A NAME="499"></A>resolved to fly, and collect what men he could by the way. But Eumenes 
<A NAME="500"></A>relieved him from his fear and trouble, undertaking so to stop the enemy's 
<A NAME="501"></A>advance that he should arrive three days later than he was expected. Having 
<A NAME="502"></A>persuaded them, he immediately despatched expresses to all the officers 
<A NAME="503"></A>to draw the men out of their winter quarters and muster them with all speed. 
<A NAME="504"></A>He himself, with some of the chief officers, rode out, and chose an elevated 
<A NAME="505"></A>tract within view, at a distance, of such as travelled the desert; this 
<A NAME="506"></A>he occupied and quartered out, and commanded many fires to be made in it, 
<A NAME="507"></A>as the custom is in a camp. This done, and the enemies seeing the fire 
<A NAME="508"></A>upon the mountains, Antigonus was filled with vexation and despondency, 
<A NAME="509"></A>supposing that his enemies had been long since advertised of his march, 
<A NAME="510"></A>and were prepared to receive him. Therefore, lest his army, now tired and 
<A NAME="511"></A>wearied out with their march, should be immediately forced to encounter 
<A NAME="512"></A>with fresh men, who had wintered well and were ready for him, quitting 
<A NAME="513"></A>the near way, he marched slowly through the towns and villages to refresh 
<A NAME="514"></A>his men. But meeting with no such skirmishes as are usual when two armies 
<A NAME="515"></A>lie near one another, and being assured by the people of the country that 
<A NAME="516"></A>no army had been seen, but only continual fires at that place, he concluded 
<A NAME="517"></A>he had been outwitted by a stratagem of Eumenes, and, much troubled, advanced 
<A NAME="518"></A>to give open battle.
<A NAME="519"></A><BR><BR>By this time, the greater part of the forces were come together 
<A NAME="520"></A>to Eumenes, and admiring his sagacity, declared him alone commander-in-chief 
<A NAME="521"></A>of the whole army; upon which Antigenes and Teutamus, the commanders of 
<A NAME="522"></A>the Argyraspids, being very much offended, and envying Eumenes, formed 
<A NAME="523"></A>a conspiracy against him; and assembling the greater part of the satraps 
<A NAME="524"></A>and officers, consulted when and how to cut him off. When they had unanimously 
<A NAME="525"></A>agreed, first to use his service in the next battle, and then to take an 
<A NAME="526"></A>occasion to destroy him, Eudamus, the master of the elephants, and Phaedimus 
<A NAME="527"></A>gave Eumenes private advice of this design, not out of kindness or good-will 
<A NAME="528"></A>to him, but lest they should lose the money they had lent him. Eumenes, 
<A NAME="529"></A>having commended them, retired to his tent, and telling his friends he 
<A NAME="530"></A>lived among a herd of wild beasts, made his will, and tore up all his letters, 
<A NAME="531"></A>lest his correspondents after his death should be questioned or punished 
<A NAME="532"></A>on account of anything in his secret papers.
<A NAME="533"></A><BR><BR>Having thus disposed of his affairs, he thought of letting the 
<A NAME="534"></A>enemy win the field, or of flying through Media and Armenia and seizing 
<A NAME="535"></A>Cappadocia, but came to no resolution while his friends stayed with him. 
<A NAME="536"></A>After turning to many expedients in his mind, which his changeable fortune 
<A NAME="537"></A>had made versatile, he at last put his men in array, and encouraged the 
<A NAME="538"></A>Greeks and barbarians; as for the phalanx and the Argyraspids, they encouraged 
<A NAME="539"></A>him, and bade him be of good heart, for the enemy would never be able to 
<A NAME="540"></A>stand them. For indeed they were the oldest of Philip's and Alexander's 
<A NAME="541"></A>soldiers, tried men, that had long made war their exercise, that had never 
<A NAME="542"></A>been beaten or foiled; most of them seventy, none less than sixty years 
<A NAME="543"></A>old. And so when they charged Antigonus's men, they cried out, "You fight 
<A NAME="544"></A>against your fathers, you rascals," and furiously falling on, routed the 
<A NAME="545"></A>whole phalanx at once, nobody being able to stand them, and the greatest 
<A NAME="546"></A>part dying by their hands. So that Antigonus's foot was routed, but his 
<A NAME="547"></A>horse got the better, and he became master of the baggage through the cowardice 
<A NAME="548"></A>of Peucestes, who behaved himself negligently and basely; while Antigonus 
<A NAME="549"></A>used his judgment calmly in the danger, being aided moreover by the ground. 
<A NAME="550"></A>For the place where they fought was a large plain, neither deep nor hard 
<A NAME="551"></A>under foot, but, like the seashore, covered with a fine soft sand which 
<A NAME="552"></A>the treading of so many men and horses in the time of battle reduced to 
<A NAME="553"></A>a small white dust, that like a cloud of lime darkened the air, so that 
<A NAME="554"></A>one could not see clearly at any distance, and so made it easy for Antigonus 
<A NAME="555"></A>to take the baggage unperceived.
<A NAME="556"></A><BR><BR>After the battle, Teutamus sent a message to Antigonus to demand 
<A NAME="557"></A>the baggage. He made answer, he would not only restore it to the Argyraspids, 
<A NAME="558"></A>but serve them further in the other things if they would but deliver up 
<A NAME="559"></A>Eumenes. Upon which the Argyraspids took a villainous resolution to deliver 
<A NAME="560"></A>him up alive into the hands of his enemies. So they came to wait upon him, 
<A NAME="561"></A>being unsuspected by him, but watching their opportunity, some lamenting 
<A NAME="562"></A>the loss of the baggage, some encouraging him as if he had been victor, 
<A NAME="563"></A>some accusing the other commanders, till at last they all fell upon him, 
<A NAME="564"></A>and seizing his sword, bound his hands behind him with his own 
<A NAME="565"></A>girdle.
<A NAME="566"></A><BR><BR>When Antigonus had sent Nicanor to receive him he begged he might 
<A NAME="567"></A>be led through the body of the Macedonians, and have liberty to speak to 
<A NAME="568"></A>them, neither to request nor deprecate anything, but only to advise them 
<A NAME="569"></A>what would be for their interest. A silence being made, as he stood upon 
<A NAME="570"></A>a rising ground, he stretched out his hands bound, and said, "What trophy, 
<A NAME="571"></A>O ye basest of all the Macedonians, could Antigonus have wished for so 
<A NAME="572"></A>great as you yourselves have erected for him in delivering up your general 
<A NAME="573"></A>captive into his hands? You are not ashamed, when you are conquerors, to 
<A NAME="574"></A>own yourselves conquered, for the sake only of your baggage, as if it were 
<A NAME="575"></A>wealth, not arms, wherein victory consisted; nay, you deliver up your general 
<A NAME="576"></A>to redeem your stuff. As for me I am unvanquished, though a captive, conqueror 
<A NAME="577"></A>of my enemies, and betrayed by my fellow-soldiers. For you, I adjure you 
<A NAME="578"></A>by Jupiter, the protector of arms, and by all the gods that are the avengers 
<A NAME="579"></A>of perjury, to kill me here with your own hands; for it is all one; and 
<A NAME="580"></A>if I am murdered yonder it will be esteemed your act, nor will Antigonus 
<A NAME="581"></A>complain, for he desires not Eumenes alive, but dead. Or if you withhold 
<A NAME="582"></A>your own hands, release but one of mine, it shall suffice to do the work; 
<A NAME="583"></A>and if you dare not trust me with a sword, throw me bound as I am under 
<A NAME="584"></A>the feet of the wild beasts. This if you do I shall freely acquit you from 
<A NAME="585"></A>the guilt of my death, as the most just and kind of men to their 
<A NAME="586"></A>general."
<A NAME="587"></A><BR><BR>While Eumenes was thus speaking, the rest of the soldiers wept 
<A NAME="588"></A>for grief, but the Argyraspids shouted out to lead him on, and give no 
<A NAME="589"></A>attention to his trifling. For it was no such great matter if this Chersonesian 
<A NAME="590"></A>pest should meet his death, who in thousands of battles had annoyed and 
<A NAME="591"></A>wasted the Macedonians; it would be a much more grievous thing for the 
<A NAME="592"></A>choicest of Philip's and Alexander's soldiers to be defrauded of the fruits 
<A NAME="593"></A>of so long service, and in their old age to come to beg their bread, and 
<A NAME="594"></A>to leave their wives three nights in the power of their enemies. So they 
<A NAME="595"></A>hurried him on with violence. But Antigonus, fearing the multitude, for 
<A NAME="596"></A>nobody was left in the camp, sent ten of his strongest elephants with divers 
<A NAME="597"></A>of his Mede and Parthian lances to keep off the press. Then he could not 
<A NAME="598"></A>endure to have Eumenes brought into his presence, by reason of their former 
<A NAME="599"></A>intimacy and friendship; but when they that had taken him inquired how 
<A NAME="600"></A>he would have him kept, "As I would," said he, "an elephant, or a lion." 
<A NAME="601"></A>A little after, being moved with compassion, he commanded the heaviest 
<A NAME="602"></A>of his irons to be knocked off, one of his servants to be admitted to anoint 
<A NAME="603"></A>him, and that any of his friends that were willing should have liberty 
<A NAME="604"></A>to visit him, and bring him what he wanted. Long time he deliberated what 
<A NAME="605"></A>to do with him, sometimes inclining to the advice and promises of Nearchus 
<A NAME="606"></A>of Crete and Demetrius his son, who were very earnest to preserve Eumenes, 
<A NAME="607"></A>whilst all the rest were unanimously instant and importunate to have him 
<A NAME="608"></A>taken off. It is related that Eumenes inquired of Onomarchus, his keeper, 
<A NAME="609"></A>why Antigonus, now he had his enemy in his hands, would not forthwith despatch 
<A NAME="610"></A>or generously release him? And that Onomarchus contumeliously answered 
<A NAME="611"></A>him, that the field had been a more proper place than this to show his 
<A NAME="612"></A>contempt of death. To whom Eumenes replied, "And, by heavens, I showed 
<A NAME="613"></A>it there; ask the men else that engaged me, but I could never meet a man 
<A NAME="614"></A>that was my superior." "Therefore," rejoined Onomarchus, "now you have 
<A NAME="615"></A>found such a man, why don't you submit quietly to his 
<A NAME="616"></A>pleasure?"
<A NAME="617"></A><BR><BR>When Antigonus resolved to kill Eumenes, he commanded to keep his 
<A NAME="618"></A>food from him, and so with two or three days' fasting he began to draw 
<A NAME="619"></A>near his end; but the camp being on a sudden to remove, an executioner 
<A NAME="620"></A>was sent to despatch him. Antigonus granted his body to his friends, permitted 
<A NAME="621"></A>them to burn it, and having gathered his ashes into a silver urn, to send 
<A NAME="622"></A>them to his wife and children.
<A NAME="623"></A><BR><BR>Eumenes was thus taken off and Divine Providence assigned to no 
<A NAME="624"></A>other man the chastisement of the commanders and soldiers that had betrayed 
<A NAME="625"></A>him; but Antigonus himself, abominating the Argyraspids as wicked and inhuman 
<A NAME="626"></A>villains, delivered them up to Sibyrtius, the governor of Arachosia, commanding 
<A NAME="627"></A>him by all ways and means to destroy and exterminate them, so that not 
<A NAME="628"></A>a man of them might ever come to Macedon, or so much as within sight of 
<A NAME="629"></A>the Greek Sea.
