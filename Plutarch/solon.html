<BR>(legendary, died 539 B.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Didymus, the grammarian, in his answer to Asclepiades concerning Solon's 
<A NAME="11"></A>Tables of Law, mentions a passage of one Philocles, who states that Solon's 
<A NAME="12"></A>father's name was Euphorion, contrary to the opinion of all others who 
<A NAME="13"></A>have written concerning him; for they generally agree that he was the son 
<A NAME="14"></A>of Execestides, a man of moderate wealth and power in the city, but of 
<A NAME="15"></A>a most noble stock, being descended from Codrus; his mother, as Heraclides 
<A NAME="16"></A>Ponticus affirms, was cousin to Pisistratus's mother, and the two at first 
<A NAME="17"></A>were great friends, partly because they were akin, and partly because of 
<A NAME="18"></A>Pisistratus's noble qualities and beauty. And they say Solon loved him; 
<A NAME="19"></A>and that is the reason, I suppose, that when afterwards they differed about 
<A NAME="20"></A>the government, their enmity never produced any hot and violent passion, 
<A NAME="21"></A>they remembered their old kindnesses, and retained-
<A NAME="22"></A><BR><BR>"Still in its embers living the strong fire" of their love and 
<A NAME="23"></A>dear affection. For that Solon was not proof against beauty, nor of courage 
<A NAME="24"></A>to stand up to passion and meet it-
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><BR>"Hand to hand as in the ring," we may conjecture by his poems, 
<A NAME="26"></A>and one of his laws, in which there are practices forbidden to slaves, 
<A NAME="27"></A>which he would appear, therefore, to recommend to freemen. Pisistratus, 
<A NAME="28"></A>it is stated, was similarly attached to one Charmus; he it was who dedicated 
<A NAME="29"></A>the future of Love in the Academy, where the runners in the sacred torch 
<A NAME="30"></A>race light their torches. Solon, as Hermippus writes, when his father had 
<A NAME="31"></A>ruined his estate in doing benefits and kindnesses to other men, though 
<A NAME="32"></A>he had friends enough that were willing to contribute to his relief, yet 
<A NAME="33"></A>was ashamed to be beholden to others, since he was descended from a family 
<A NAME="34"></A>who were accustomed to do kindnesses rather than receive them; and therefore 
<A NAME="35"></A>applied himself to merchandise in his youth; though others assure us that 
<A NAME="36"></A>he travelled rather to get learning and experience than to make money. 
<A NAME="37"></A>It is certain that he was a lover of knowledge, for when he was old he 
<A NAME="38"></A>would say, that he-
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR>"Each day grew older, and learnt something new;" and yet no admirer 
<A NAME="40"></A>of riches, esteeming as equally wealthy the man-
<A NAME="41"></A><BR><BR>"Who hath both gold and silver in his hand,
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>Horses and mules, and acres of wheat-land,
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>And him whose all is decent food to eat,
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>Clothes to his back and shoes upon his feet,
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>And a young wife and child, since so 'twill be,
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>And no more years than will with that agree;" and in another 
<A NAME="47"></A>place-
<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>"Wealth I would have, but wealth by wrong procure
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>I would not; justice, e'en if slow, is sure." And it is perfectly possible 
<A NAME="50"></A>for a good man and a statesman, without being solicitous for superfluities, 
<A NAME="51"></A>to show some concern for competent necessaries. In his time, as Hesiod 
<A NAME="52"></A>says,- "Work was a shame to none," nor was distinction made with respect 
<A NAME="53"></A>to trade, but merchandise was a noble calling, which brought home the good 
<A NAME="54"></A>things which the barbarous nations enjoyed, was the occasion of friendship 
<A NAME="55"></A>with their kings, and a great source of experience. Some merchants have 
<A NAME="56"></A>built great cities, as Protis, the founder of Massilia, to whom the Gauls, 
<A NAME="57"></A>near the Rhone, were much attached. Some report also, that Thales and Hippocrates 
<A NAME="58"></A>the mathematician traded; and that Plato defrayed the charges of his travels 
<A NAME="59"></A>by selling oil in Egypt. Solon's softness and profuseness, his popular 
<A NAME="60"></A>rather than philosophical tone about pleasure in his poems, have been ascribed 
<A NAME="61"></A>to his trading life; for, having suffered a thousand dangers, it was natural 
<A NAME="62"></A>they should be recompensed with some gratifications and enjoyments; but 
<A NAME="63"></A>that he accounted himself rather poor than rich is evident from the 
<A NAME="64"></A>lines-
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR>"Some wicked men are rich, some good are poor,
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>We will not change our virtue for their store:
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>Virtue's a thing that none can take away;
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>But money changes owners all the day."
<A NAME="69"></A><BR><BR>At first he used his poetry only in trifles, not for any serious 
<A NAME="70"></A>purpose, but simply to pass away his idle hours; but afterwards he introduced 
<A NAME="71"></A>moral sentences and state matters, which he did, not to record them merely 
<A NAME="72"></A>as an historian, but to justify his own actions, and sometimes to correct, 
<A NAME="73"></A>chastise, and stir up the Athenians to noble performances. Some report 
<A NAME="74"></A>that he designed to put his laws into heroic verse, and that they began 
<A NAME="75"></A>thus:-
<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR>"We humbly beg a blessing on our laws
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>From mighty jove, and honour, and applause."
<A NAME="78"></A><BR><BR>In philosophy, as most of the wise men then, he chiefly esteemed 
<A NAME="79"></A>the political part of morals; in physics, he was very plain and antiquated, 
<A NAME="80"></A>as appears by this:-
<A NAME="81"></A><BR><BR>"It is the clouds that make the snow and hail,
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>And thunder comes from lightning without fail;
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>The sea is stormy when the winds have blown,
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>But it deals fairly when 'tis left alone." And, indeed, it is probable 
<A NAME="85"></A>that at that time Thales alone had raised philosophy above mere practice 
<A NAME="86"></A>into speculation; and the rest of the wise men were so called from prudence 
<A NAME="87"></A>in political concerns. It is said, that they had an interview at Delphi, 
<A NAME="88"></A>and another at Corinth, by the procurement of Periander, who made a meeting 
<A NAME="89"></A>for them, and a supper. But their reputation was chiefly raised by sending 
<A NAME="90"></A>the tripod to them all, by their modest refusal, and complaisant yielding 
<A NAME="91"></A>to one another. For, as the story goes, some of the Coans fishing with 
<A NAME="92"></A>a net, some strangers, Milesians, bought the draught at a venture; the 
<A NAME="93"></A>net brought up a golden tripod, which, they say, Helen, at her return from 
<A NAME="94"></A>Troy, upon the remembrance of an old prophecy, threw in there. Now, the 
<A NAME="95"></A>strangers at first contesting with the fishers about the tripod, and the 
<A NAME="96"></A>cities espousing the quarrel so far as to engage themselves in a war, Apollo 
<A NAME="97"></A>decided the controversy by commanding to present it to the wisest man; 
<A NAME="98"></A>and first it was sent to Miletus to Thales, the Coans freely presenting 
<A NAME="99"></A>him with that for which they fought against the whole body of the Milesians; 
<A NAME="100"></A>but Thales declaring Bias the wiser person, it was sent to him; from him 
<A NAME="101"></A>to another; and so, going round them all, it came to Thales a second time; 
<A NAME="102"></A>and, at last, being carried from Miletus to Thebes, was there dedicated 
<A NAME="103"></A>to Apollo Ismenius. Theophrastus writes that it was first presented to 
<A NAME="104"></A>Bias at Priene; and next to Thales at Miletus, and so through all it returned 
<A NAME="105"></A>to Bias, and was afterwards sent to Delphi. This is the general report, 
<A NAME="106"></A>only some, instead of a tripod, say this present was a cup sent by Croesus; 
<A NAME="107"></A>others, a piece of plate that one Bathycles had left. It is stated, that 
<A NAME="108"></A>Anacharsis and Solon, and Solon and Thales, were familiarly acquainted 
<A NAME="109"></A>and some have delivered parts of their discourse; for, they say, Anacharsis, 
<A NAME="110"></A>coming to Athens, knocked at Solon's door, and told him, that he, being 
<A NAME="111"></A>a stranger, was come to be his guest, and contract a friendship with him; 
<A NAME="112"></A>and Solon replying, "It is better to make friends at home," Anacharsis 
<A NAME="113"></A>replied, "Then you that are at home make friendship with me." Solon, somewhat 
<A NAME="114"></A>surprised at the readiness of the repartee, received him kindly, and kept 
<A NAME="115"></A>him some time with him, being already engaged in public business and the 
<A NAME="116"></A>compilation of his laws; which, when Anacharsis understood, he laughed 
<A NAME="117"></A>at him for imagining the dishonesty and covetousness of his countrymen 
<A NAME="118"></A>could be restrained by written laws, which were like spiders' webs, and 
<A NAME="119"></A>would catch, it is true, the weak and poor, but easily be broken by the 
<A NAME="120"></A>mighty and rich. To this Solon rejoined that men keep their promises when 
<A NAME="121"></A>neither side can get anything by the breaking of them; and he would so 
<A NAME="122"></A>fit his laws to the citizens, that all should understand it was more eligible 
<A NAME="123"></A>to be just than to break the laws. But the event rather agreed with the 
<A NAME="124"></A>conjecture of Anacharsis than Solon's hope. Anacharsis, being once at the 
<A NAME="125"></A>Assembly, expressed his wonder at the fact that in Greece wise men spoke 
<A NAME="126"></A>and fools decided.
<A NAME="127"></A><BR><BR>Solon went, they say, to Thales, at Miletus, and wondered that 
<A NAME="128"></A>Thales took no care to get him a wife and children. To this, Thales made 
<A NAME="129"></A>no answer for the present; but a few days after procured a stranger to 
<A NAME="130"></A>pretend that he had left Athens ten days ago; and Solon inquiring what 
<A NAME="131"></A>news there, the man, according to his instructions, replied, "None but 
<A NAME="132"></A>a young man's funeral, which the whole city attended; for he was the son, 
<A NAME="133"></A>they said, of an honourable man, the most virtuous of the citizens, who 
<A NAME="134"></A>was not then at home, but had been travelling a long time." Solon replied, 
<A NAME="135"></A>"What a miserable man is he! But what was his name?" "I have heard it," 
<A NAME="136"></A>says the man, "but have now forgotten it, only there was a great talk of 
<A NAME="137"></A>his wisdom and his justice." Thus Solon was drawn on by every answer, and 
<A NAME="138"></A>his fears heightened, till at last, being extremely concerned, he mentioned 
<A NAME="139"></A>his own name, and asked the stranger if that young man was called Solon's 
<A NAME="140"></A>son; and the stranger assenting, he began to beat his head, and to do and 
<A NAME="141"></A>say all that is usual with men in transports of grief. But Thales took 
<A NAME="142"></A>his hand, and, with a smile, said, "These things, Solon, keep me from marriage 
<A NAME="143"></A>and rearing children, which are too great for even your constancy to support; 
<A NAME="144"></A>however, be not concerned at the report, for it is a fiction." This Hermippus 
<A NAME="145"></A>relates, from Pataecus, who boasted that he had Aesop's 
<A NAME="146"></A>soul.
<A NAME="147"></A><BR><BR>However, it is irrational and poor-spirited not to seek conveniences 
<A NAME="148"></A>for fear of losing them, for upon the same account we should not allow 
<A NAME="149"></A>ourselves to like wealth, glory, or wisdom, since we may fear to be deprived 
<A NAME="150"></A>of all these; nay, even virtue itself, than which there is no greater nor 
<A NAME="151"></A>more desirable possession, is often suspended by sickness or drugs. Now 
<A NAME="152"></A>Thales, though unmarried, could not be free from solicitude unless he likewise 
<A NAME="153"></A>felt no care for his friends, his kinsman, or his country; yet we are told 
<A NAME="154"></A>be adopted Cybisthus, his sister's son. For the soul, having a principle 
<A NAME="155"></A>of kindness in itself, and being born to love, as well as perceive, think, 
<A NAME="156"></A>or remember, inclines and fixes upon some stranger, when a man has none 
<A NAME="157"></A>of his own to embrace. And alien or illegitimate objects insinuate themselves 
<A NAME="158"></A>into his affections, as into some estate that lacks lawful heirs; and with 
<A NAME="159"></A>affection come anxiety and care; insomuch that you may see men that use 
<A NAME="160"></A>the strongest language against the marriage-bed and the fruit of it, when 
<A NAME="161"></A>some servant's or concubine's child is sick or dies, almost killed with 
<A NAME="162"></A>grief, and abjectly lamenting. Some have given way to shameful and desperate 
<A NAME="163"></A>sorrow at the loss of a dog or horse; others have borne the death of virtuous 
<A NAME="164"></A>children without any extravagant or unbecoming grief, have passed the rest 
<A NAME="165"></A>of their lives like men, and according to the principles of reason. It 
<A NAME="166"></A>is not affection, it is weakness that brings men, unarmed against fortune 
<A NAME="167"></A>by reason, into these endless pains and terrors; and they indeed have not 
<A NAME="168"></A>even the present enjoyment of what they dote upon, the possibility of the 
<A NAME="169"></A>future loss causing them continual pangs, tremors, and distresses. We must 
<A NAME="170"></A>not provide against the loss of wealth by poverty, or of friends by refusing 
<A NAME="171"></A>all acquaintance, or of children by having none, but by morality and reason. 
<A NAME="172"></A>But of this too much.
<A NAME="173"></A><BR><BR>Now, when the Athenians were tired with a tedious and difficult 
<A NAME="174"></A>war that they conducted against the Megarians for the island Salamis and 
<A NAME="175"></A>made a law that it should be death for any man, by writing or speaking, 
<A NAME="176"></A>to assert that the city ought to endeavour to recover it, Solon, vexed 
<A NAME="177"></A>at the disgrace, and perceiving thousands of the youth wished for somebody 
<A NAME="178"></A>to begin, but did not dare to stir first for fear of the law, counterfeited 
<A NAME="179"></A>a distraction, and by his own family it was spread about the city that 
<A NAME="180"></A>he was mad. He then secretly composed some elegiac verses, and getting 
<A NAME="181"></A>them by heart, that it might seem extempore, ran out into the market-place 
<A NAME="182"></A>with a cap upon his head, and, the people gathering about him, got upon 
<A NAME="183"></A>the herald's stand, and sang that elegy which begins 
<A NAME="184"></A>thus-
<A NAME="185"></A><BR><BR>"I am a herald come from Salamis the fair,
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>My news from thence my verses shall declare." The poem is called Salamis; 
<A NAME="187"></A>it contains an hundred verses very elegantly written; when it had been 
<A NAME="188"></A>sung, his friends commended it, and especially Pisistratus exhorted the 
<A NAME="189"></A>citizens to obey his directions; insomuch that they recalled the law, and 
<A NAME="190"></A>renewed the war under Solon's conduct. The popular tale is, that with Pisistratus 
<A NAME="191"></A>he sailed to Colias, and, finding the women, according to the custom of 
<A NAME="192"></A>the country there, sacrificing to Ceres, he sent a trusty friend to Salamis, 
<A NAME="193"></A>who should pretend himself a renegade, and advise them, if they desired 
<A NAME="194"></A>to seize the chief Athenian women, to come with him at once to Colias; 
<A NAME="195"></A>the Megarians presently sent off men in the vessel with him; and Solon, 
<A NAME="196"></A>seeing it put off from the island, commanded the women to be gone, and 
<A NAME="197"></A>some beardless youths, dressed in their clothes, their shoes and caps, 
<A NAME="198"></A>and privately armed with daggers, to dance and play near the shore till 
<A NAME="199"></A>the enemies had landed and the vessel was in their power. Things being 
<A NAME="200"></A>thus ordered, the Megarians were lured with the appearance, and, coming 
<A NAME="201"></A>to the shore, jumped out, eager who should first seize a prize, so that 
<A NAME="202"></A>not one of them escaped; and the Athenians set sail for the island and 
<A NAME="203"></A>took it.
<A NAME="204"></A><BR><BR>Others say that it was not taken this way, but that he first received 
<A NAME="205"></A>this oracle from Delphi:-
<A NAME="206"></A><BR><BR>"Those heroes that in fair Asopia rest,
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>All buried with their faces to the west,
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>Go and appease with offerings of the best; and that Solon, sailing 
<A NAME="209"></A>by night to the island, sacrificed to the heroes Periphemus and Cychreus, 
<A NAME="210"></A>and then taking five hundred Athenian volunteers (a law having passed that 
<A NAME="211"></A>those that took the island should be highest in the government), with a 
<A NAME="212"></A>number of fisher-boats and one thirty-oared ship, anchored in a bay of 
<A NAME="213"></A>Salamis that looks towards Nisaea; and the Megarians that were then in 
<A NAME="214"></A>the island, hearing only an uncertain report, hurried to their arms, and 
<A NAME="215"></A>sent a ship to reconnoiter the enemies. This ship Solon took, and, securing 
<A NAME="216"></A>the Megarians, manned it with Athenians, and gave them orders to sail to 
<A NAME="217"></A>the island with as much privacy as possible; meantime he, with the other 
<A NAME="218"></A>soldiers, marched against the Megarians by land, and whilst they were fighting, 
<A NAME="219"></A>those from the ship took the city. And this narrative is confirmed by the 
<A NAME="220"></A>following solemnity, that was afterwards observed: An Athenian ship used 
<A NAME="221"></A>to sail silently at first to the island, then, with noise and a great shout, 
<A NAME="222"></A>one leapt out armed, and with a loud cry ran to the promontory Sciradium 
<A NAME="223"></A>to meet those that approached upon the land. And just by there stands a 
<A NAME="224"></A>temple which Solon dedicated to Mars. For he beat the Megarians, and as 
<A NAME="225"></A>many as were not killed in the battle he sent away upon 
<A NAME="226"></A>conditions.
<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR>The Megarians, however, still contending, and both sides having 
<A NAME="228"></A>received considerable losses, they chose the Spartans for arbitrators. 
<A NAME="229"></A>Now, many affirm that Homer's authority did Solon a considerable kindness, 
<A NAME="230"></A>and that, introducing a line into the Catalogue of Ships, when the matter 
<A NAME="231"></A>was to be determined, he read the passage as follows:-
<A NAME="232"></A><BR><BR>"Twelve ships from Salamis stout Ajax brought,
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>And ranked his men where the Athenians fought." The Athenians, however, 
<A NAME="234"></A>call this but an idle story, and report that Solon made it appear to the 
<A NAME="235"></A>judges, that Philaeus and Eurysaces, the sons of Ajax, being made citizens 
<A NAME="236"></A>of Athens, gave them the island, and that one of them dwelt at Brauron 
<A NAME="237"></A>in Attica, the other at Melite; and they have a township of Philaidae, 
<A NAME="238"></A>to which Pisistratus belonged, deriving its name from this Philaeus. Solon 
<A NAME="239"></A>took a farther argument against the Megarians from the dead bodies, which, 
<A NAME="240"></A>he said, were not buried after their fashion, but according to the Athenian; 
<A NAME="241"></A>for the Megarians turn the corpse to the east, the Athenians to the west. 
<A NAME="242"></A>But Hereas the Megarian denies this, and affirms that they likewise turn 
<A NAME="243"></A>the body to the west, and also that the Athenians have a separate tomb 
<A NAME="244"></A>for everybody, but the Megarians put two or three into one. However, some 
<A NAME="245"></A>of Apollo's oracles, where he calls Salamis Ionian, made much for Solon. 
<A NAME="246"></A>This matter was determined by five Spartans, Critolaidas, Amompharetus, 
<A NAME="247"></A>Hypsechidas, Anaxilas, and Cleomenes.
<A NAME="248"></A><BR><BR>For this, Solon grew famed and powerful; but his advice in favour 
<A NAME="249"></A>of defending the oracle at Delphi, to give aid, and not to suffer the Cirrhaeans 
<A NAME="250"></A>to profane it, but to maintain the honour of the god, got him most repute 
<A NAME="251"></A>among the Greeks; for upon his persuasion the Amphictyons undertook the 
<A NAME="252"></A>war, as amongst others, Aristotle affirms, in his enumeration of the victors 
<A NAME="253"></A>at the Pythian games, where he makes Solon the author of this counsel. 
<A NAME="254"></A>Solon, however, was not general in that expedition, as Hermippus states, 
<A NAME="255"></A>out of Evanthes the Samian; for Aeschines the orator says no such thing, 
<A NAME="256"></A>and, in the Delphian register, Alcmaeon, not Solon, is named as commander 
<A NAME="257"></A>of the Athenians.
<A NAME="258"></A><BR><BR>Now the Cylonian pollution had a long while disturbed the commonwealth, 
<A NAME="259"></A>ever since the time when Megacles the archon persuaded the conspirators 
<A NAME="260"></A>with Cylon that took sanctuary in Minerva's temple to come down and stand 
<A NAME="261"></A>to a fair trial. And they, tying a thread to the image, and holding one 
<A NAME="262"></A>end of it, went down to the tribunal; but when they came to the temple 
<A NAME="263"></A>of the Furies, the thread broke of its own accord, upon which, as if the 
<A NAME="264"></A>goddess had refused them protection, they were seized by Megacles and the 
<A NAME="265"></A>other magistrates as many as were without the temples were stoned, these 
<A NAME="266"></A>that fled for sanctuary were butchered at the altar, and only those escaped 
<A NAME="267"></A>who made supplication to the wives of the magistrates. But they from that 
<A NAME="268"></A>time were considered under pollution, and regarded with hatred. The remainder 
<A NAME="269"></A>of the faction of Cylon grew strong again, and had continual quarrels with 
<A NAME="270"></A>the family of Megacles; and now the quarrel being at its height, and the 
<A NAME="271"></A>people divided, Solon, being in reputation, interposed with the chiefest 
<A NAME="272"></A>of the Athenians, and by entreaty and admonition persuaded the polluted 
<A NAME="273"></A>to submit to a trial and the decision of three hundred noble citizens. 
<A NAME="274"></A>And Myron of Phlya being their accuser, they were found guilty, and as 
<A NAME="275"></A>many as were then alive were banished, and the bodies of the dead were 
<A NAME="276"></A>dug up, and scattered beyond the confines of the country. In the midst 
<A NAME="277"></A>of these distractions, the Megarians falling upon them, they lost Nisaea 
<A NAME="278"></A>and Salamis again; besides, the city was disturbed with superstitious fears 
<A NAME="279"></A>and strange appearances, and the priests declared that the sacrifices intimated 
<A NAME="280"></A>some villainies and pollutions that were to be expiated. Upon this, they 
<A NAME="281"></A>sent for Epimenides the Phaestian from Crete, who is counted the seventh 
<A NAME="282"></A>wise man by those that will not admit Periander into the number. He seems 
<A NAME="283"></A>to have been thought a favourite of heaven, possessed of knowledge in all 
<A NAME="284"></A>the supernatural and ritual parts of religion; and, therefore, the men 
<A NAME="285"></A>of his age called him a new Curies, and son of a nymph named Balte. When 
<A NAME="286"></A>he came to Athens, and grew acquainted with Solon, he served him in many 
<A NAME="287"></A>instances, and prepared the way for his legislation. He made them moderate 
<A NAME="288"></A>in their forms of worship, and abated their mourning by ordering some sacrifices 
<A NAME="289"></A>presently after the funeral, and taking off those severe and barbarous 
<A NAME="290"></A>ceremonies which the women usually practised; but the greatest benefit 
<A NAME="291"></A>was his purifying and sanctifying the city, by certain propitiatory and 
<A NAME="292"></A>expiatory lustrations, and foundations of sacred buildings, by that means 
<A NAME="293"></A>making them more submissive to justice, and more inclined to harmony. It 
<A NAME="294"></A>is reported that, looking upon Munychia, and considering a long while. 
<A NAME="295"></A>he said to those that stood by, "How blind is man in future things! for 
<A NAME="296"></A>did the Athenians foresee what mischief this would do their city, they 
<A NAME="297"></A>would even eat it with their own teeth to be rid of it." A similar anticipation 
<A NAME="298"></A>is ascribed to Thales; they say he commanded his friends to bury him in 
<A NAME="299"></A>an obscure and contemned quarter of the territory of Mileteus, saying that 
<A NAME="300"></A>it should some day be the market-place of the Milesians. Epimenides, being 
<A NAME="301"></A>much honoured, and receiving from the city rich offers of large gifts and 
<A NAME="302"></A>privileges, requested but one branch of the sacred olive, and, on that 
<A NAME="303"></A>being granted, returned.
<A NAME="304"></A><BR><BR>The Athenians, now the Cylonian sedition was over and the polluted 
<A NAME="305"></A>gone into banishment fell into their old quarrels about the government, 
<A NAME="306"></A>there being as many different parties as there were diversities in the 
<A NAME="307"></A>country. The Hill quarter favoured democracy, the Plain, oligarchy, and 
<A NAME="308"></A>those that lived by the Seaside stood for a mixed sort of government, and 
<A NAME="309"></A>so hindered either of the other parties from prevailing. And the disparity 
<A NAME="310"></A>of fortune between the rich and the poor, at that time, also reached its 
<A NAME="311"></A>height; so that the city seemed to be in a truly dangerous condition, and 
<A NAME="312"></A>no other means for freeing it from disturbances and settling it to be possible 
<A NAME="313"></A>but a despotic power. All the people were indebted to the rich; and either 
<A NAME="314"></A>they tilled their land for their creditors, paying them a sixth part of 
<A NAME="315"></A>the increase, and were, therefore, called Hectemorii and Thetes, or else 
<A NAME="316"></A>they engaged their body for the debt, and might be seized, and either sent 
<A NAME="317"></A>into slavery at home, or sold to strangers; some (for no law forbade it) 
<A NAME="318"></A>were forced to sell their children, or fly their country to avoid the cruelty 
<A NAME="319"></A>of their creditors; but the most part and the bravest of them began to 
<A NAME="320"></A>combine together and encourage one another to stand to it, to choose a 
<A NAME="321"></A>leader, to liberate the condemned debtors, divide the land, and change 
<A NAME="322"></A>the government.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR><BR>Then the wisest of the Athenians, perceiving Solon was of all men 
<A NAME="324"></A>the only one not implicated in the troubles, that he had not joined in 
<A NAME="325"></A>the exactions of the rich and was not involved in the necessities of the 
<A NAME="326"></A>poor, pressed him to succour the commonwealth and compose the differences. 
<A NAME="327"></A>Though Phanias the Lesbian affirms, that Solon, to save his country' put 
<A NAME="328"></A>a trick upon both parties, and privately promised the poor a division of 
<A NAME="329"></A>the lands, and the rich security for their debts. Solon, however, himself 
<A NAME="330"></A>says, that it was reluctantly at first that he engaged in state affairs, 
<A NAME="331"></A>being afraid of the pride of one party and the greediness of the other; 
<A NAME="332"></A>he was chosen archon, however, after Philombrotus, and empowered to be 
<A NAME="333"></A>an arbitrator and lawgiver; the rich consenting because he was wealthy, 
<A NAME="334"></A>the poor because he was honest. There was a saying of his current before 
<A NAME="335"></A>the election, that when things are even there never can be war, and this 
<A NAME="336"></A>pleased both parties, the wealthy and the poor; the one conceiving him 
<A NAME="337"></A>to mean, when all have their fair proportion; the others, when all are 
<A NAME="338"></A>absolutely equal. Thus, there being great hopes on both sides, the chief 
<A NAME="339"></A>men pressed Solon to take the government into his own hands, and, when 
<A NAME="340"></A>he was once settled, manage the business freely and according to his pleasure; 
<A NAME="341"></A>and many of the commons, perceiving it would be a difficult change to be 
<A NAME="342"></A>effected by law and reason, were willing to have one wise and just man 
<A NAME="343"></A>set over the affairs; and some say that Solon had this oracle from 
<A NAME="344"></A>Apollo-
<A NAME="345"></A><BR><BR>"Take the mid-seat, and be the vessel's guide;
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>Many in Athens are upon your side." But chiefly his familiar friends 
<A NAME="347"></A>chid him for disaffecting monarchy only because of the name, as if the 
<A NAME="348"></A>virtue of the ruler could not make it a lawful form; Euboea had made this 
<A NAME="349"></A>experiment when it chose Tynnondas, and Mitylene, which had made Pittacus 
<A NAME="350"></A>its prince; yet this could not shake Solon's resolution; but, as they say, 
<A NAME="351"></A>he replied to his friends, that it was true a tyranny was a very fair spot, 
<A NAME="352"></A>but it had no way down from it; and in a copy of verses to Phocus he 
<A NAME="353"></A>writes"-
<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR>that I spared my land,
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>And withheld from usurpation and from violence my 
<A NAME="356"></A>hand,
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>And forbore to fix a stain and a disgrace on my good 
<A NAME="358"></A>name,
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>I regret not; I believe that it will be my chiefest fame." From which 
<A NAME="360"></A>it is manifest that he was a man of great reputation before he gave his 
<A NAME="361"></A>laws. The several mocks that were put upon him for refusing the power, 
<A NAME="362"></A>he records in these words:-
<A NAME="363"></A><BR><BR>"Solon surely was a dreamer, and a man of simple 
<A NAME="364"></A>mind;
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>When the gods would give him fortune, he of his own will 
<A NAME="366"></A>declined;
<A NAME="367"></A><BR><BR>When the net was full of fishes, over-heavy thinking 
<A NAME="368"></A>it,
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>He declined to haul it up, through want of heart and want of 
<A NAME="370"></A>wit.
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>Had but I that chance of riches and of kingship, for one 
<A NAME="372"></A>day,
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>I would give my skin for flaying, and my house to die 
<A NAME="374"></A>away."
<A NAME="375"></A><BR><BR>Thus he makes the many and the low people speak of him. Yet, though 
<A NAME="376"></A>he refused the government, he was not too mild in the affair; he did not 
<A NAME="377"></A>show himself mean and submissive to the powerful, nor make his laws to 
<A NAME="378"></A>pleasure those that chose him. For where it was well before, he applied 
<A NAME="379"></A>no remedy, nor altered anything, for fear lest-
<A NAME="380"></A><BR><BR>"Overthrowing altogether and disordering the state," he should 
<A NAME="381"></A>be too weak to new-model and recompose it to a tolerable condition; but 
<A NAME="382"></A>what he thought he could effect by persuasion upon the pliable, and by 
<A NAME="383"></A>force upon the stubborn, this he did, as he himself 
<A NAME="384"></A>says-
<A NAME="385"></A><BR><BR>"With force and justice working both in one." And, therefore, when 
<A NAME="386"></A>he was afterwards asked if he had left the Athenians the best laws that 
<A NAME="387"></A>could be given, he replied, "The best they could receive." The way which, 
<A NAME="388"></A>the moderns say, the Athenians have of softening the badness of a thing, 
<A NAME="389"></A>by ingeniously giving it some pretty and innocent appellation, calling 
<A NAME="390"></A>harlots, for example, mistresses, tributes customs, a garrison a guard, 
<A NAME="391"></A>and the jail the chamber, seem originally to have been Solon's contrivance, 
<A NAME="392"></A>who called cancelling debts Seisacthea, a relief, or disencumbrance. For 
<A NAME="393"></A>the first thing which he settled was, that what debts remained should be 
<A NAME="394"></A>forgiven, and no man, for the future, should engage the body of his debtor 
<A NAME="395"></A>for security. Though some, as Androtion, affirm that the debts were not 
<A NAME="396"></A>cancelled, but the interest only lessened, which sufficiently pleased the 
<A NAME="397"></A>people; so that they named this benefit the Seisacthea, together with the 
<A NAME="398"></A>enlarging their measures and raising the value of their money; for he made 
<A NAME="399"></A>a pound, which before passed for seventy-three drachmas, go for a hundred; 
<A NAME="400"></A>so that, though the number of pieces in the payment was equal, the value 
<A NAME="401"></A>was less; which proved a considerable benefit to those that were to discharge 
<A NAME="402"></A>great debts, and no loss to the creditors. But most agree that it was the 
<A NAME="403"></A>taking off the debts that was called Seisacthea, which is confirmed by 
<A NAME="404"></A>some places in his poem, where he takes honour to himself, 
<A NAME="405"></A>that-
<A NAME="406"></A><BR><BR>"The mortgage-stones that covered her, by me
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>Removed,- the land that was a slave is free: that some who had been 
<A NAME="408"></A>seized for their debts he had brought back from other countries, 
<A NAME="409"></A>where-
<A NAME="410"></A><BR><BR>"-so far their lot to roam,
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>They had forgot the language of their home; and some he had set at 
<A NAME="412"></A>liberty-
<A NAME="413"></A><BR><BR>"Who here in shameful servitude were held."
<A NAME="414"></A><BR><BR>While he was designing this, a most vexatious thing happened; for 
<A NAME="415"></A>when he had resolved to take off the debts, and was considering the proper 
<A NAME="416"></A>form and fit beginning for it, he told some of his friends, Conon, Clinias, 
<A NAME="417"></A>and Hipponicus, in whom he had a great deal of confidence, that he would 
<A NAME="418"></A>not meddle with the lands, but only free the people from their debts; upon 
<A NAME="419"></A>which they, using their advantage, made haste and borrowed some considerable 
<A NAME="420"></A>sums of money, and purchased some large farms; and when the law was enacted, 
<A NAME="421"></A>they kept the possessions, and would not return the money; which brought 
<A NAME="422"></A>Solon into great suspicion and dislike, as if he himself had not been abused, 
<A NAME="423"></A>but was concerned in the contrivance. But he presently stopped this suspicion, 
<A NAME="424"></A>by releasing his debtors of five talents (for he had lent so much), according 
<A NAME="425"></A>to the law; others, as Polyzelus the Rhodian, say fifteen; his friends, 
<A NAME="426"></A>however, were ever afterward called Chreocopidae, repudiators.
<A NAME="427"></A><BR><BR>In this he pleased neither party, for the rich were angry for their 
<A NAME="428"></A>money, and the poor that the land was not divided, and, as Lycurgus ordered 
<A NAME="429"></A>in his commonwealth, all men reduced to equality. He, it is true, being 
<A NAME="430"></A>the eleventh from Hercules, and having reigned many years in Lacedaemon, 
<A NAME="431"></A>had got a great reputation and friends and power, which he could use in 
<A NAME="432"></A>modelling his state; and applying force more than persuasion, insomuch 
<A NAME="433"></A>that he lost his eye in the scuffle, was able to employ the most effectual 
<A NAME="434"></A>means for the safety and harmony of a state, by not permitting any to be 
<A NAME="435"></A>poor or rich in his commonwealth. Solon could not rise to that in his polity, 
<A NAME="436"></A>being but a citizen of the middle classes; yet he acted fully up to the 
<A NAME="437"></A>height of his power, having nothing but the good-will and good opinion 
<A NAME="438"></A>of his citizens to rely on; and that he offended the most part, who looked 
<A NAME="439"></A>for another result, he declares in the words-
<A NAME="440"></A><BR><BR>"Formerly they boasted of me vainly; with averted 
<A NAME="441"></A>eyes
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>Now they look askance upon me; friends no more, but enemies." And yet 
<A NAME="443"></A>had any other man, he says, received the same power-
<A NAME="444"></A><BR><BR>"He would not have forborne, nor let alone,
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>But made the fattest of the milk his own." Soon, however, becoming 
<A NAME="446"></A>sensible of the good that was done, they laid by their grudges, made a 
<A NAME="447"></A>public sacrifice, calling it Seisacthea, and chose Solon to new-model and 
<A NAME="448"></A>make laws for the commonwealth, giving him the entire power over everything, 
<A NAME="449"></A>their magistracies, their assemblies, courts, and councils; that he should 
<A NAME="450"></A>appoint the number, times of meeting, and what estate they must have that 
<A NAME="451"></A>could be capable of these, and dissolve or continue any of the present 
<A NAME="452"></A>constitutions, according to his pleasure.
<A NAME="453"></A><BR><BR>First, then, he repealed all Draco's laws, except those concerning 
<A NAME="454"></A>homicide, because they were too severe, and the punishment too great; for 
<A NAME="455"></A>death was appointed for almost all offences, insomuch that those that were 
<A NAME="456"></A>convicted of idleness were to die, and those that stole a cabbage or an 
<A NAME="457"></A>apple to suffer even as villains that committed sacrilege or murder. So 
<A NAME="458"></A>that Demades, in after time, was thought to have said very happily, that 
<A NAME="459"></A>Draco's laws were written not with ink but blood; and he himself, being 
<A NAME="460"></A>once asked why be made death the punishment of most offences, replied, 
<A NAME="461"></A>"Small ones deserve that, and I have no higher for the greater 
<A NAME="462"></A>crimes."
<A NAME="463"></A><BR><BR>Next, Solon, being willing to continue the magistracies in the 
<A NAME="464"></A>hands of the rich men, and yet receive the people into the other part of 
<A NAME="465"></A>the government, took an account of the citizens' estates, and those that 
<A NAME="466"></A>were worth five hundred measures of fruit, dry and liquid, he placed in 
<A NAME="467"></A>the first rank, calling them Pentacosiomedimni; those that could keep an 
<A NAME="468"></A>horse, or were worth three hundred measures, were named Hippada Teluntes, 
<A NAME="469"></A>and made the second class; the Zeugitae, that had two hundred measures, 
<A NAME="470"></A>were in the third; and all the others were called Thetes, who were not 
<A NAME="471"></A>admitted to any office, but could come to the assembly, and act as jurors; 
<A NAME="472"></A>which at first seemed nothing, but afterwards was found an enormous privilege, 
<A NAME="473"></A>as almost every matter of dispute came before them in this latter capacity. 
<A NAME="474"></A>Even in the cases which he assigned to the archon's cognisance, he allowed 
<A NAME="475"></A>an appeal to the courts. Besides, it is said that he was obscure and ambiguous 
<A NAME="476"></A>in the wording of his laws, on purpose to increase the honour of his courts; 
<A NAME="477"></A>for since their differences could not be adjusted by the letter, they would 
<A NAME="478"></A>have to bring all their causes to the judges, who thus were in a manner 
<A NAME="479"></A>masters of the laws. Of this equalisation he himself makes mention in this 
<A NAME="480"></A>manner:-
<A NAME="481"></A><BR><BR>"Such power I gave the people as might do,
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>Abridged not what they had, now lavished new,
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>Those that were great in wealth and high in place
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>My counsel likewise kept from all disgrace.
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>Before them both I held my shield of might,
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>And let not either touch the other's right." And for the greater security 
<A NAME="487"></A>of the weak commons, he gave general liberty of indicting for an act of 
<A NAME="488"></A>injury; if any one was beaten, maimed, or suffered any violence, any man 
<A NAME="489"></A>that would and was able might prosecute the wrong-doer; intending by this 
<A NAME="490"></A>to accustom the citizens, like members of the same body, to resent and 
<A NAME="491"></A>be sensible of one another's injuries. And there is a saying of his agreeable 
<A NAME="492"></A>to his law, for, being asked what city was best modelled, "That," said 
<A NAME="493"></A>he, "where those that are not injured try and punish the unjust as much 
<A NAME="494"></A>as those that are."
<A NAME="495"></A><BR><BR>When he had constituted the Areopagus of those who had been yearly 
<A NAME="496"></A>archons, of which he himself was a member therefore, observing that the 
<A NAME="497"></A>people, now free from their debts, were unsettled and imperious, he formed 
<A NAME="498"></A>another council of four hundred, a hundred out of each of the four tribes, 
<A NAME="499"></A>which was to inspect all matters before they were propounded to the people, 
<A NAME="500"></A>and to take care that nothing but what had been first examined should be 
<A NAME="501"></A>brought before the general assembly. The upper council, or Areopagus, he 
<A NAME="502"></A>made inspectors and keepers of the laws, conceiving that the commonwealth, 
<A NAME="503"></A>held by these two councils, like anchors, would be less liable to be tossed 
<A NAME="504"></A>by tumults, and the people be more quiet. Such is the general statement, 
<A NAME="505"></A>that Solon instituted the Areopagus; which seems to be confirmed, because 
<A NAME="506"></A>Draco makes no mention of the Areopagites, but in all causes of blood refers 
<A NAME="507"></A>to the Ephetae; yet Solon's thirteenth table contains the eighth law set 
<A NAME="508"></A>down in these very words: "Whoever before Solon's archonship were disfranchised, 
<A NAME="509"></A>let them be restored, except those that, being condemned by the Areopagus, 
<A NAME="510"></A>Ephetae, or in the Prytaneum by the kings, for homicide, murder, or designs 
<A NAME="511"></A>against the government, were in banishment when this law was made; and 
<A NAME="512"></A>these words seem to show that the Areopagus existed before Solon's laws, 
<A NAME="513"></A>for who could be condemned by that council before his time, if he was the 
<A NAME="514"></A>first that instituted the court? unless, which is probable, there is some 
<A NAME="515"></A>ellipsis, or want of precision in the language, and it should run thus:- 
<A NAME="516"></A>"Those that are convicted of such offences as belong to the cognisance 
<A NAME="517"></A>of the Areopagites, Ephetae, or the Prytanes, when this law was made," 
<A NAME="518"></A>shall remain still in disgrace, whilst others are restored; of this the 
<A NAME="519"></A>reader must judge.
<A NAME="520"></A><BR><BR>Amongst his other laws, one is very peculiar and surprising, which 
<A NAME="521"></A>disfranchises all who stand neuter in a sedition; for it seems he would 
<A NAME="522"></A>not have any one remain insensible and regardless of the public good, and 
<A NAME="523"></A>securing his private affairs, glory that he has no feeling of the distempers 
<A NAME="524"></A>of his country; but at once join with the good party and those that have 
<A NAME="525"></A>the right upon their side, assist and venture with them, rather than keep 
<A NAME="526"></A>out of harm's way and watch who would get the better. It seems an absurd 
<A NAME="527"></A>and foolish law which permits an heiress, if her lawful husband fail her, 
<A NAME="528"></A>to take his nearest kinsman; yet some say this law was well contrived against 
<A NAME="529"></A>those who, conscious of their own unfitness, yet, for the sake of the portion, 
<A NAME="530"></A>would match with heiresses, and make use of law to put a violence upon 
<A NAME="531"></A>nature; for now, since she can quit him for whom she pleases, they would 
<A NAME="532"></A>either abstain from such marriages, or continue them with disgrace, and 
<A NAME="533"></A>suffer for their covetousness and designed affront; it is well done, moreover, 
<A NAME="534"></A>to confine her to her husband's nearest kinsman, that the children may 
<A NAME="535"></A>be of the same family. Agreeable to this is the law that the bride and 
<A NAME="536"></A>bridegroom shall be shut into a chamber, and eat a quince together; and 
<A NAME="537"></A>that the husband of an heiress shall consort with her thrice a month; for 
<A NAME="538"></A>though there be no children, yet it is an honour and due affection which 
<A NAME="539"></A>an husband ought to pay to a virtuous, chaste wife; it takes off all petty 
<A NAME="540"></A>differences, and will not permit their little quarrels to proceed to a 
<A NAME="541"></A>rupture.
<A NAME="542"></A><BR><BR>In all other marriages he forbade dowries to be given; the wife 
<A NAME="543"></A>was to have three suits of clothes, a little inconsiderable household stuff, 
<A NAME="544"></A>and that was all; for he would not have marriages contracted for gain or 
<A NAME="545"></A>an estate, but for pure love, kind affection, and birth of children. When 
<A NAME="546"></A>the mother of Dionysius desired him to marry her to one of his citizens, 
<A NAME="547"></A>"Indeed," said he, "by my tyranny I have broken my country's laws, but 
<A NAME="548"></A>cannot put a violence upon those of nature by an unseasonable marriage." 
<A NAME="549"></A>Such disorder is never to be suffered in a commonwealth, nor such unseasonable 
<A NAME="550"></A>and unloving and unperforming marriages, which attain no due end or fruit; 
<A NAME="551"></A>any provident governor or lawgiver might say to an old man that takes a 
<A NAME="552"></A>young wife what is said to Philoctetes in the tragedy-
<A NAME="553"></A><BR><BR>"Truly, in a fit state thou to marry! and if he find a young man, 
<A NAME="554"></A>with a rich and elderly wife, growing fat in his place, like the partridges, 
<A NAME="555"></A>remove him to a young woman of proper age. And of this 
<A NAME="556"></A>enough.
<A NAME="557"></A><BR><BR>Another commendable law of Solon's is that which forbids men to 
<A NAME="558"></A>speak evil of the dead; for it is pious to think the deceased sacred, and 
<A NAME="559"></A>just, not to meddle with those that are gone, and politic, to prevent the 
<A NAME="560"></A>perpetuity of discord. He likewise forbade them to speak evil of the living 
<A NAME="561"></A>in the temples, the courts of justice, the public offices, or at the games, 
<A NAME="562"></A>or else to pay three drachmas to the person, and two to the public. For 
<A NAME="563"></A>never to be able to control passion shows a weak nature and ill-breeding; 
<A NAME="564"></A>and always to moderate it is very hard, and to some impossible. And laws 
<A NAME="565"></A>must look to possibilities, if the maker designs to punish few in order 
<A NAME="566"></A>to their amendment, and not many to no purpose.
<A NAME="567"></A><BR><BR>He is likewise much commended for his law concerning wills; before 
<A NAME="568"></A>him none could be made, but all the wealth and estate of the deceased belonged 
<A NAME="569"></A>to his family; but he by permitting them, if they had no children to bestow 
<A NAME="570"></A>it on whom they pleased, showed that he esteemed friendship a stronger 
<A NAME="571"></A>tie than kindred, affection than necessity; and made every man's estate 
<A NAME="572"></A>truly his own. Yet he allowed not all sorts of legacies, but those only 
<A NAME="573"></A>which were not extorted by the frenzy of a disease, charms, imprisonment, 
<A NAME="574"></A>force, or the persuasions of a wife; with good reason thinking that being 
<A NAME="575"></A>seduced into wrong was as bad as being forced, and that between deceit 
<A NAME="576"></A>and necessity, flattery and compulsion, there was little difference, since 
<A NAME="577"></A>both may equally suspend the exercise of reason.
<A NAME="578"></A><BR><BR>He regulated the walks, feasts, and mourning of the women and took 
<A NAME="579"></A>away everything that was either unbecoming or immodest; when they walked 
<A NAME="580"></A>abroad, no more than three articles of dress were allowed them; an obol's 
<A NAME="581"></A>worth of meat and drink; and no basket above a cubit high; and at night 
<A NAME="582"></A>they were not to go about unless in a chariot with a torch before them. 
<A NAME="583"></A>Mourners tearing themselves to raise pity, and set wailings, and at one 
<A NAME="584"></A>man's funeral to lament for another, he forbade. To offer an ox at the 
<A NAME="585"></A>grave was not permitted, nor to bury above three pieces of dress with the 
<A NAME="586"></A>body, or visit the tombs of any besides their own family, unless at the 
<A NAME="587"></A>very funeral; most of which are likewise forbidden by our laws, but this 
<A NAME="588"></A>is further added in ours, that those that are convicted of extravagance 
<A NAME="589"></A>in their mournings are to be punished as soft and effeminate by the censors 
<A NAME="590"></A>of women.
<A NAME="591"></A><BR><BR>Observing the city to be filled with persons that flocked from 
<A NAME="592"></A>all parts into Attica for security of living, and that most of the country 
<A NAME="593"></A>was barren and unfruitful, and that traders at sea import nothing to those 
<A NAME="594"></A>that could give them nothing in exchange, he turned his citizens to trade, 
<A NAME="595"></A>and made a law that no son be obliged to relieve a father who had not bred 
<A NAME="596"></A>him up to any calling. It is true, Lycurgus, having a city free from all 
<A NAME="597"></A>strangers, and land, according to Euripides-
<A NAME="598"></A><BR><BR>"Large for large hosts, for twice their number much," and, above 
<A NAME="599"></A>all, an abundance of labourers about Sparta, who should not be left idle, 
<A NAME="600"></A>but be kept down with continual toil and work, did well to take off his 
<A NAME="601"></A>citizens from laborious and mechanical occupations, and keep them to their 
<A NAME="602"></A>arms, and teach them only the art of war. But Solon, fitting his laws to 
<A NAME="603"></A>the state of things, and not making things to suit his laws, and finding 
<A NAME="604"></A>the ground scarce rich enough to maintain the husbandmen, and altogether 
<A NAME="605"></A>incapable of feeding an unoccupied and leisured multitude, brought trades 
<A NAME="606"></A>into credit, and ordered the Areopagites to examine how every man got his 
<A NAME="607"></A>living, and chastise the idle. But that law was yet more rigid which, as 
<A NAME="608"></A>Heraclides Ponticus delivers, declared the sons of unmarried mothers not 
<A NAME="609"></A>obliged to relieve their fathers; for he that avoids the honourable form 
<A NAME="610"></A>of union shows that he does not take a woman for children, but for pleasure, 
<A NAME="611"></A>and thus gets his just reward, and has taken away from himself every title 
<A NAME="612"></A>to upbraid his children, to whom he has made their very birth a scandal 
<A NAME="613"></A>and reproach.
<A NAME="614"></A><BR><BR>Solon's laws in general about women are his strangest; for he permitted 
<A NAME="615"></A>any one to kill an adulterer that found him in the act- but if any one 
<A NAME="616"></A>forced a free woman, a hundred drachmas was the fine; if he enticed her, 
<A NAME="617"></A>twenty; except those that sell themselves openly, that is, harlots, who 
<A NAME="618"></A>go openly to those that hire them. He made it unlawful to sell a daughter 
<A NAME="619"></A>or a sister, unless, being yet unmarried, she was found wanton. Now it 
<A NAME="620"></A>is irrational to punish the same crime sometimes very severely and without 
<A NAME="621"></A>remorse, and sometimes very lightly, and as it were in sport, with a trivial 
<A NAME="622"></A>fine; unless there being little money then in Athens, scarcity made those 
<A NAME="623"></A>mulcts the more grievous punishment. In the valuation for sacrifices, a 
<A NAME="624"></A>sheep and a bushel were both estimated at a drachma; the victor in the 
<A NAME="625"></A>Isthmian games was to have for reward an hundred drachmas; the conqueror 
<A NAME="626"></A>in the Olympian, five hundred; he that brought a wolf, five drachmas; for 
<A NAME="627"></A>a whelp, one; the former sum, as Demetrius the Phalerian asserts, was the 
<A NAME="628"></A>value of an ox, the latter, of a sheep. The prices which Solon, in his 
<A NAME="629"></A>sixteenth table, sets on choice victims, were naturally far greater; yet 
<A NAME="630"></A>they, too, are very low in comparison of the present. The Athenians were, 
<A NAME="631"></A>from the beginning, great enemies to wolves, their fields being better 
<A NAME="632"></A>for pasture than corn. Some affirm their tribes did not take their names 
<A NAME="633"></A>from the sons of Ion, but from the different sorts of occupation that they 
<A NAME="634"></A>followed; the soldiers were called Hoplitae, the craftsmen Ergades, and, 
<A NAME="635"></A>of the remaining two, the farmers Gedeontes, and the shepherds and graziers 
<A NAME="636"></A>Aegicores.
<A NAME="637"></A><BR><BR>Since the country has but few rivers, lakes, or large springs, 
<A NAME="638"></A>and many used wells which they had dug, there was a law made, that, where 
<A NAME="639"></A>there was a public well within a hippicon, that is, four furlongs, all 
<A NAME="640"></A>should draw at that; but when it was farther off, they should try and procure 
<A NAME="641"></A>a well of their own; and if they had dug ten fathoms deep and could find 
<A NAME="642"></A>no water, they had liberty to fetch a pitcherful of four gallons and a 
<A NAME="643"></A>half in a day from their neighbours'; for he thought it prudent to make 
<A NAME="644"></A>provision against want, but not to supply laziness. He showed skill in 
<A NAME="645"></A>his orders about planting, for any one that would plant another tree was 
<A NAME="646"></A>not to set it within five feet of his neighbour's field; but if a fig or 
<A NAME="647"></A>an olive not within nine; for their roots spread farther, nor can they 
<A NAME="648"></A>be planted near all sorts of trees without damage, for they draw away the 
<A NAME="649"></A>nourishment, and in some cases are noxious by their effluvia. He that would 
<A NAME="650"></A>dig a pit or a ditch was to dig it at the distance of its own depth from 
<A NAME="651"></A>his neighbour's ground; and he that would raise stocks of bees was not 
<A NAME="652"></A>to place them within three hundred feet of those which another had already 
<A NAME="653"></A>raised.
<A NAME="654"></A><BR><BR>He permitted only oil to be exported, and those that exported any 
<A NAME="655"></A>other fruit, the archon was solemnly to curse, or else pay an hundred drachmas 
<A NAME="656"></A>himself; and this law was written in his first table, and, therefore, let 
<A NAME="657"></A>none think it incredible, as some affirm, that the exportation of figs 
<A NAME="658"></A>was once unlawful, and the informer against the delinquents called a sycophant. 
<A NAME="659"></A>He made a law, also, concerning hurts and injuries from beasts, in which 
<A NAME="660"></A>he commands the master of any dog that bit a man to deliver him up with 
<A NAME="661"></A>a log about his neck, four and a half feet long; a happy device for men's 
<A NAME="662"></A>security. The law concerning naturalizing strangers is of doubtful character; 
<A NAME="663"></A>he permitted only those to be made free of Athens who were in perpetual 
<A NAME="664"></A>exile from their own country, or came with their whole family to trade 
<A NAME="665"></A>there; this he did, not to discourage strangers, but rather to invite them 
<A NAME="666"></A>to a permanent participation in the privileges of the government; and, 
<A NAME="667"></A>besides, he thought those would prove the more faithful citizens who had 
<A NAME="668"></A>been forced from their own country, or voluntarily forsook it. The law 
<A NAME="669"></A>of public entertainment (parasitein is his name for it) is also peculiarly 
<A NAME="670"></A>Solon's; for if any man came often, or if he that was invited refused, 
<A NAME="671"></A>they were punished, for he concluded that one was greedy, the other a contemner 
<A NAME="672"></A>of the state.
<A NAME="673"></A><BR><BR>All his laws he established for an hundred years, and wrote them 
<A NAME="674"></A>on wooden tables or rollers, named axones, which might be turned round 
<A NAME="675"></A>in oblong cases; some of their relics were in my time still to be seen 
<A NAME="676"></A>in the Prytaneum, or common hall at Athens. These, as Aristotle states, 
<A NAME="677"></A>were called cyrbes, and there is a passage of Cratinus the 
<A NAME="678"></A>comedian-
<A NAME="679"></A><BR><BR>"By Solon, and by Draco, if you please,
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>Whose Cyrbes make the fires that parch our peas." But some say those 
<A NAME="681"></A>are properly cyrbes, which contain laws concerning sacrifices and the rites 
<A NAME="682"></A>of religion, and all the others axones. The council all jointly swore to 
<A NAME="683"></A>confirm the laws, and every one of the Thesmothetae vowed for himself at 
<A NAME="684"></A>the stone in the market-place, that if he broke any of the statutes, he 
<A NAME="685"></A>would dedicate a golden statue, as big as himself, at 
<A NAME="686"></A>Delphi.
<A NAME="687"></A><BR><BR>Observing the irregularity of the months, and that the moon does 
<A NAME="688"></A>not always rise and set with the sun, but often in the same day overtakes 
<A NAME="689"></A>and gets before him, he ordered the day should be named the Old and New, 
<A NAME="690"></A>attributing that part of it which was before the conjunction to the old 
<A NAME="691"></A>moon, and the rest to the new, he being the first, it seems, that understood 
<A NAME="692"></A>that verse of Homer-
<A NAME="693"></A><BR><BR>"The end and the beginning of the month," and the following day 
<A NAME="694"></A>he called the new moon. After the twentieth he did not count by addition, 
<A NAME="695"></A>but, like the moon itself in its wane, by subtraction; thus up to the 
<A NAME="696"></A>thirtieth.
<A NAME="697"></A><BR><BR>Now when these laws were enacted, and some came to Solon every 
<A NAME="698"></A>day, to commend or dispraise them, and to advise, if possible, to leave 
<A NAME="699"></A>out or put in something, and many criticized and desired him to explain, 
<A NAME="700"></A>and tell the meaning of such and such a passage, he, knowing that to do 
<A NAME="701"></A>it was useless, and not to do it would get him ill-will, and desirous to 
<A NAME="702"></A>bring himself out of all straits, and to escape all displeasure and exceptions, 
<A NAME="703"></A>it being a hard thing, as he himself says-
<A NAME="704"></A><BR><BR>"In great affairs to satisfy all sides," as an excuse for travelling, 
<A NAME="705"></A>bought a trading vessel, and, having leave for ten years' absence, departed, 
<A NAME="706"></A>hoping that by that time his laws would have become 
<A NAME="707"></A>familiar.
<A NAME="708"></A><BR><BR>His first voyage was for Egypt, and he lived, as he himself 
<A NAME="709"></A>says-
<A NAME="710"></A><BR><BR>"Near Nilus' mouth, by fair Canopus' shore," and spent some time 
<A NAME="711"></A>in study with Psenophis of Heliopolis, and Sonchis the Saite, the most 
<A NAME="712"></A>learned of all the priests; from whom, as Plato says, getting knowledge 
<A NAME="713"></A>of the Atlantic story, he put it into a poem, and proposed to bring it 
<A NAME="714"></A>to the knowledge of the Greeks. From thence he sailed to Cyprus, where 
<A NAME="715"></A>he was made much of by Philocyprus, one of the kings there, who had a small 
<A NAME="716"></A>city built by Demophon, Theseus's son, near the river Clarius, in a strong 
<A NAME="717"></A>situation, but incommodious and uneasy of access. Solon persuaded him, 
<A NAME="718"></A>since there lay a fair plain below, to remove, and build there a pleasanter 
<A NAME="719"></A>and more spacious city. And he stayed himself, and assisted in gathering 
<A NAME="720"></A>inhabitants, and in fitting it both for defence and convenience of living; 
<A NAME="721"></A>insomuch that many flocked to Philocyprus, and the other kings imitated 
<A NAME="722"></A>the design; and, therefore, to honour Solon, he called the city Soli, which 
<A NAME="723"></A>was formerly named Aepea. And Solon himself, in his Elegies, addressing 
<A NAME="724"></A>Philocyprus, mentions this foundation in these words:-
<A NAME="725"></A><BR><BR>"Long may you live, and fill the Solian throne,
<A NAME="726"></A><BR>Succeeded still by children of your own;
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>And from your happy island while I sail,
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>Let Cyprus send for me a favouring gale;
<A NAME="729"></A><BR>May she advance, and bless your new command,
<A NAME="730"></A><BR>Prosper your town, and send me safe to land."
<A NAME="731"></A><BR><BR>That Solon should discourse with Croesus, some think not agreeable 
<A NAME="732"></A>with chronology; but I cannot reject so famous and well-attested a narrative, 
<A NAME="733"></A>and, what is more, so agreeable to Solon's temper, and so worthy his wisdom 
<A NAME="734"></A>and greatness of mind, because, forsooth, it does not agree with some chronological 
<A NAME="735"></A>canons, which thousands have endeavoured to regulate, and yet, to this 
<A NAME="736"></A>day, could never bring their differing opinions to any agreement. They 
<A NAME="737"></A>say, therefore, that Solon, coming to Croesus at his request, was in the 
<A NAME="738"></A>same condition as an inland man when first he goes to see the sea; for 
<A NAME="739"></A>as he fancies every river he meets with to be the ocean, so Solon, as he 
<A NAME="740"></A>passed through the court, and saw a great many nobles richly dressed, and 
<A NAME="741"></A>proudly attended with a multitude of guards and footboys, thought every 
<A NAME="742"></A>one had been the king, till he was brought to Croesus, who was decked with 
<A NAME="743"></A>every possible rarity and curiosity, in ornaments of jewels, purple, and 
<A NAME="744"></A>gold, that could make a grand and gorgeous spectacle of him. Now when Solon 
<A NAME="745"></A>came before him, and seemed not at all surprised, nor gave Croesus those 
<A NAME="746"></A>compliments he expected, but showed himself to all discerning eyes to be 
<A NAME="747"></A>a man that despised the gaudiness and petty ostentation of it, he commanded 
<A NAME="748"></A>them to open all his treasure houses, and carry him to see his sumptuous 
<A NAME="749"></A>furniture and luxuries, though he did not wish it; Solon could judge of 
<A NAME="750"></A>him well enough by the first sight of him; and, when he returned from viewing 
<A NAME="751"></A>all, Croesus asked him if ever he had known a happier man than he. And 
<A NAME="752"></A>when Solon answered that he had known one Tellus, a fellow-citizen of his 
<A NAME="753"></A>own, and told him that this Tellus had been an honest man, had had good 
<A NAME="754"></A>children, a competent estate, and died bravely in battle for his country, 
<A NAME="755"></A>Croesus took him for an ill-bred fellow and a fool, for not measuring happiness 
<A NAME="756"></A>by the abundance of gold and silver, and preferring the life and death 
<A NAME="757"></A>of a private and mean man before so much power and empire. He asked him, 
<A NAME="758"></A>however, again, if, besides Tellus, he knew any other man more happy. And 
<A NAME="759"></A>Solon replying, Yes, Cleobis and Biton, who were loving brothers, and extremely 
<A NAME="760"></A>dutiful sons to their mother, and, when the oxen delayed her, harnessed 
<A NAME="761"></A>themselves to the wagon, and drew her to Juno's temple, her neighbours 
<A NAME="762"></A>all calling her happy, and she herself rejoicing; then, after sacrificing 
<A NAME="763"></A>and feasting, they went to rest, and never rose again, but died in the 
<A NAME="764"></A>midst of their honour a painless and tranquil death. "What," said Croesus, 
<A NAME="765"></A>angrily, "and dost not thou reckon us amongst the happy men at all?" Solon, 
<A NAME="766"></A>unwilling either to flatter or exasperate him more, replied, "The gods, 
<A NAME="767"></A>O king, have given the Greeks all other gifts in moderate degree; and so 
<A NAME="768"></A>our wisdom, too, is a cheerful and a homely, not a noble and kingly wisdom; 
<A NAME="769"></A>and this, observing the numerous misfortunes that attend all conditions, 
<A NAME="770"></A>forbids us to grow insolent upon our present enjoyments, or to admire any 
<A NAME="771"></A>man's happiness that may yet, in course of time, suffer change. For the 
<A NAME="772"></A>uncertain future has yet to come, with every possible variety of fortune; 
<A NAME="773"></A>and him only to whom the divinity has continued happiness unto the end 
<A NAME="774"></A>we call happy; to salute as happy one that is still in the midst of life 
<A NAME="775"></A>and hazard, we think as little safe and conclusive as to crown and proclaim 
<A NAME="776"></A>as victorious the wrestler that is yet in the ring." After this, he was 
<A NAME="777"></A>dismissed, having given Croesus some pain, but no instruction.
<A NAME="778"></A><BR><BR>Aesop, who wrote the fables, being then at Sardis upon Croesus's 
<A NAME="779"></A>invitation, and very much esteemed, was concerned that Solon was so ill 
<A NAME="780"></A>received, and gave him this advice: "Solon, let your converse with kings 
<A NAME="781"></A>be either short or seasonable." "Nay, rather," replied Solon, "either short 
<A NAME="782"></A>or reasonable." So at this time Croesus despised Solon; but when he was 
<A NAME="783"></A>overcome by Cyrus, had lost his city, was taken alive, condemned to be 
<A NAME="784"></A>burnt, and laid bound upon the pile before all the Persians and Cyrus himself, 
<A NAME="785"></A>he cried out as loud as possibly he could three times, "O Solon!" and Cyrus 
<A NAME="786"></A>being surprised, and sending some to inquire what man or god this Solon 
<A NAME="787"></A>was, who alone he invoked in this extremity, Croesus told him the whole 
<A NAME="788"></A>story, saying, "He was one of the wise men of Greece, whom I sent for, 
<A NAME="789"></A>not to be instructed, or to learn anything that I wanted, but that he should 
<A NAME="790"></A>see and be a witness of my happiness; the loss of which was, it seems, 
<A NAME="791"></A>to be a greater evil than the enjoyment was a good; for when I had them 
<A NAME="792"></A>they were goods only in opinion, but now the loss of them has brought upon 
<A NAME="793"></A>me intolerable and real evils. And he, conjecturing from what then was, 
<A NAME="794"></A>this that now is, bade look to the end of my life, and not rely and grow 
<A NAME="795"></A>proud upon uncertainties." When this was told Cyrus, who was a wiser man 
<A NAME="796"></A>than Croesus, and saw in the present example Solon's maxim confirmed, he 
<A NAME="797"></A>not only freed Croesus from punishment, but honoured him as long as he 
<A NAME="798"></A>lived; and Solon had the glory, by the same saying, to save one king and 
<A NAME="799"></A>instruct another.
<A NAME="800"></A><BR><BR>When Solon was gone, the citizens began to quarrel; Lycurgus headed 
<A NAME="801"></A>the Plain; Megacles, the son of Alcmaeon, those to the Seaside; and Pisistratus 
<A NAME="802"></A>the Hill-party, in which were the poorest people, the Thetes, and greatest 
<A NAME="803"></A>enemies to the rich; insomuch that, though the city still used the new 
<A NAME="804"></A>laws, yet all looked for and desired a change of government, hoping severally 
<A NAME="805"></A>that the change would be better for them, and put them above the contrary 
<A NAME="806"></A>faction. Affairs standing thus, Solon returned, and was reverenced by all, 
<A NAME="807"></A>and honoured; but his old age would not permit him to be as active, and 
<A NAME="808"></A>to speak in public, as formerly; yet, by privately conferring with the 
<A NAME="809"></A>heads of the factions, he endeavoured to compose the differences, Pisistratus 
<A NAME="810"></A>appearing the most tractable; for he was extremely smooth and engaging 
<A NAME="811"></A>in his language, a great friend to the poor, and moderate in his resentments; 
<A NAME="812"></A>and what nature had not given him, he had the skill to imitate; so that 
<A NAME="813"></A>he was trusted more than the others, being accounted a prudent and orderly 
<A NAME="814"></A>man, one that loved equality, and would be an enemy to any that moved against 
<A NAME="815"></A>the present settlement. Thus he deceived the majority of people; but Solon 
<A NAME="816"></A>quickly discovered his character, and found out his design before any one 
<A NAME="817"></A>else; yet did not hate him upon this, but endeavoured to humble him, and 
<A NAME="818"></A>bring him off from his ambition, and often told him and others, that if 
<A NAME="819"></A>any one could banish the passion for pre-eminence from his mind, and cure 
<A NAME="820"></A>him of his desire of absolute power, none would make a more virtuous man 
<A NAME="821"></A>or a more excellent citizen. Thespis, at this time, beginning to act tragedies, 
<A NAME="822"></A>and the thing, because it was new, taking very much with the multitude, 
<A NAME="823"></A>though it was not yet made a matter of competition, Solon, being by nature 
<A NAME="824"></A>fond of hearing and learning something new, and now, in his old age, living 
<A NAME="825"></A>idly, and enjoying himself, indeed, with music and with wine, went to see 
<A NAME="826"></A>Thespis himself, as the ancient custom was, act: and after the play was 
<A NAME="827"></A>done, he addressed him, and asked him if he was not ashamed to tell so 
<A NAME="828"></A>many lies before such a number of people; and Thespis replying that it 
<A NAME="829"></A>was no harm to say or do so in play, Solon vehemently struck his staff 
<A NAME="830"></A>against the ground: "Ah," said he, "if we honour and commend such play 
<A NAME="831"></A>as this, we shall find it some day in our business."
<A NAME="832"></A><BR><BR>Now when Pisistratus, having wounded himself, was brought into 
<A NAME="833"></A>the market-place in a chariot, and stirred up the people, as if he had 
<A NAME="834"></A>been thus treated by his opponents because of his political conduct, and 
<A NAME="835"></A>a great many were enraged and cried out, Solon, coming close to him, said, 
<A NAME="836"></A>"This, O son of Hippocrates, is a bad copy of Homer's Ulysses; you do, 
<A NAME="837"></A>to trick your countrymen, what he did to deceive his enemies." After this, 
<A NAME="838"></A>the people were eager to protect Pisistratus, and met in an assembly, where 
<A NAME="839"></A>one Ariston making a motion that they should allow Pisistratus fifty clubmen 
<A NAME="840"></A>for a guard to his person, Solon opposed it, and said much to the same 
<A NAME="841"></A>purport as what he has left us in his poems-
<A NAME="842"></A><BR><BR>"You dote upon his words and taking phrase;" and 
<A NAME="843"></A>again-
<A NAME="844"></A><BR><BR>"True, you are singly each a crafty soul,
<A NAME="845"></A><BR>But all together make one empty fool." But observing the poor men bent 
<A NAME="846"></A>to gratify Pisistratus, and tumultuous, and the rich fearful and getting 
<A NAME="847"></A>out of harm's way, he departed, saying he was wiser than some and stouter 
<A NAME="848"></A>than others; wiser than those that did not understand the design, stouter 
<A NAME="849"></A>than those that, though they understood it, were afraid to oppose the tyranny. 
<A NAME="850"></A>Now, the people, having passed the law, were not nice with Pisistratus 
<A NAME="851"></A>about the number of his clubmen, but took no notice of it, though he enlisted 
<A NAME="852"></A>and kept as many as he would, until he seized the Acropolis. When that 
<A NAME="853"></A>was done, and the city in an uproar, Megacles, with all his family, at 
<A NAME="854"></A>once fled; but Solon, though he was now very old, and had none to back 
<A NAME="855"></A>him, yet came into the marketplace and made a speech to the citizens, partly 
<A NAME="856"></A>blaming their inadvertency and meanness of spirit, and in part urging and 
<A NAME="857"></A>exhorting them not thus tamely to lose their liberty; and likewise then 
<A NAME="858"></A>spoke that memorable saying, that, before, it was an easier task to stop 
<A NAME="859"></A>the rising tyranny, but now the great and more glorious action to destroy 
<A NAME="860"></A>it, when it was begun already, and had gathered strength. But all being 
<A NAME="861"></A>afraid to side with him, he returned home, and, taking his arms, he brought 
<A NAME="862"></A>them out and laid them in the porch before his door, with these words: 
<A NAME="863"></A>"I have done my part to maintain my country and my laws," and then he busied 
<A NAME="864"></A>himself no more. His friends advising him to fly, he refused, but wrote 
<A NAME="865"></A>poems, and thus reproached the Athenians in them:-
<A NAME="866"></A><BR><BR>"If now you suffer, do not blame the Powers,
<A NAME="867"></A><BR>For they are good, and all the fault was ours,
<A NAME="868"></A><BR>All the strongholds you put into his hands,
<A NAME="869"></A><BR>And now his slaves must do what he commands." And many telling him 
<A NAME="870"></A>that the tyrant would take his life for this, and asking what he trusted 
<A NAME="871"></A>to, that he ventured to speak so boldly, he replied, "To my old age." But 
<A NAME="872"></A>Pisistratus, having got the command, so extremely courted Solon, so honoured 
<A NAME="873"></A>him, obliged him, and sent to see him, that Solon gave him his advice, 
<A NAME="874"></A>and approved many of his actions; for he retained most of Solon's laws, 
<A NAME="875"></A>observed them himself, and compelled his friends to obey. And he himself, 
<A NAME="876"></A>though already absolute ruler, being accused of murder before the Areopagus, 
<A NAME="877"></A>came quietly to clear himself; but his accuser did not appear. And he added 
<A NAME="878"></A>other laws, one of which is that the maimed in the wars should be maintained 
<A NAME="879"></A>at the public charge; this Heraclides Ponticus records, and that Pisistratus 
<A NAME="880"></A>followed Solon's example in this, who had decreed it in the case of one 
<A NAME="881"></A>Thersippus, that was maimed; and Theophrastus asserts that it was Pisistratus, 
<A NAME="882"></A>not Solon, that made that law against laziness, which was the reason that 
<A NAME="883"></A>the country was more productive, and the city tranquiller.
<A NAME="884"></A><BR><BR>Now Solon, having begun the great work in verse, the history or 
<A NAME="885"></A>fable of the Atlantic Island, which he had learned from the wise men in 
<A NAME="886"></A>Sais, and thought convenient for the Athenians to know, abandoned it; not, 
<A NAME="887"></A>as Plato says, by reason of want of time, but because of his age, and being 
<A NAME="888"></A>discouraged at the greatness of the task; for that he had leisure enough, 
<A NAME="889"></A>such verses testify, as-
<A NAME="890"></A><BR><BR>"Each day grow older, and learn something new;" and 
<A NAME="891"></A>again-
<A NAME="892"></A><BR><BR>"But now the Powers, of Beauty, Song, and Wine,
<A NAME="893"></A><BR>Which are most men's delights, are also mine." Plato, willing to improve 
<A NAME="894"></A>the story of the Atlantic Island, as if it were a fair estate that wanted 
<A NAME="895"></A>an heir and came with some title to him, formed, indeed, stately entrances, 
<A NAME="896"></A>noble enclosures, large courts, such as never yet introduced any story, 
<A NAME="897"></A>fable, or poetic fiction; but, beginning it late, ended his life before 
<A NAME="898"></A>his work; and the reader's regret for the unfinished part is the greater, 
<A NAME="899"></A>as the satisfaction he takes in that which is complete is extraordinary. 
<A NAME="900"></A>For as the city of Athens left only the temple of Jupiter Olympius unfinished, 
<A NAME="901"></A>so Plato, amongst all his excellent works, left this only piece about the 
<A NAME="902"></A>Atlantic Island imperfect. Solon lived after Pisistratus seized the government, 
<A NAME="903"></A>as Heraclides Ponticus asserts, a long time; but Phanias the Eresian says 
<A NAME="904"></A>not two full years; for Pisistratus began his tyranny when Comias was archon, 
<A NAME="905"></A>and Phanias says Solon died under Hegestratus, who succeeded Comias. The 
<A NAME="906"></A>story that his ashes were scattered about the island Salamis is too strange 
<A NAME="907"></A>to be easily believed, or be thought anything but a mere fable; and yet 
<A NAME="908"></A>it is given, amongst other good authors, by Aristotle, the 
<A NAME="909"></A>philosopher.
