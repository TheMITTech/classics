<BR>(died 449 B.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Peripoltas the prophet, having brought the King Opheltas, and those under 
<A NAME="11"></A>his command, from Thessaly into Boeotia, left there a family, which flourished 
<A NAME="12"></A>a long time after; the greater part of them inhabiting Chaeronea, the first 
<A NAME="13"></A>city out of which they expelled the barbarians. The descendants of this 
<A NAME="14"></A>race, being men of bold attempts and warlike habits, exposed themselves 
<A NAME="15"></A>to so many danger's in the invasions of the Mede, and in battles against 
<A NAME="16"></A>the Gauls, that at last they were almost wholly consumed.
<A NAME="17"></A><BR><BR>There was left one orphan of this house, called Damon, surnamed 
<A NAME="18"></A>Peripoltas, in beauty and greatness of spirit surpassing all of his age, 
<A NAME="19"></A>but rude and undisciplined in temper. A Roman captain of a company that 
<A NAME="20"></A>wintered in Chaeronea became passionately fond of this youth, who was now 
<A NAME="21"></A>pretty nearly grown a man. And finding all his approaches, his gifts, his 
<A NAME="22"></A>entreaties, alike repulsed, he showed violent inclinations to assault Damon. 
<A NAME="23"></A>Our native Chaeronea was then in a distressed condition, too small and 
<A NAME="24"></A>too poor to meet with anything but neglect. Damon, being sensible of this, 
<A NAME="25"></A>and looking upon himself as injured already, resolved to inflict punishment. 
<A NAME="26"></A>Accordingly, he and sixteen of his companions conspired against the captain; 
<A NAME="27"></A>but that the design might be managed without any danger of being discovered, 
<A NAME="28"></A>they all daubed their faces at night with soot. Thus disguised and inflamed 
<A NAME="29"></A>with wine, they set upon him by break of day, as he was sacrificing in 
<A NAME="30"></A>the market-place; and having killed him, and several others that were with 
<A NAME="31"></A>him, they fled out of the city, which was extremely alarmed and troubled 
<A NAME="32"></A>at the murder. The council assembled immediately, and pronounced sentence 
<A NAME="33"></A>of death against Damon and his accomplices. This they did to justify the 
<A NAME="34"></A>city to the Romans. But that evening, as the magistrates were at supper 
<A NAME="35"></A>together, according to the custom, Damon and his confederates, breaking 
<A NAME="36"></A>into the hall, killed them, and then fled again out of the town. About 
<A NAME="37"></A>this time, Lucius Lucullus chanced to be passing that way with a body of 
<A NAME="38"></A>troops, upon some expedition, and this disaster having but recently happened, 
<A NAME="39"></A>he stayed to examine the matter. Upon inquiry, he found the city was in 
<A NAME="40"></A>no wise faulty, but rather that they themselves had suffered; therefore 
<A NAME="41"></A>he drew out the soldiers, and carried them away with him. Yet Damon continuing 
<A NAME="42"></A>to ravage the country all about, the citizens, by messages and decrees, 
<A NAME="43"></A>in appearance favourable, enticed him into the city, and upon his return, 
<A NAME="44"></A>made him Gymnasiarch; but afterwards as he was anointing himself in the 
<A NAME="45"></A>vapour baths, they set upon him and killed him. For a long while after 
<A NAME="46"></A>apparitions continuing to be seen, and groans to be heard in that place, 
<A NAME="47"></A>so our fathers have told us, they ordered the gates of the baths to be 
<A NAME="48"></A>built up; and even to this day those who live in the neighbourhood believe 
<A NAME="49"></A>that they sometimes see spectres and hear alarming sounds. The posterity 
<A NAME="50"></A>of Damon, of whom some still remain, mostly in Phocis, near the town of 
<A NAME="51"></A>Stiris, are called Asbolomeni, that is, in the Aeolian idiom, men daubed 
<A NAME="52"></A>with soot: because Damon was thus besmeared when he committed this 
<A NAME="53"></A>murder.
<A NAME="54"></A><BR><BR>But there being a quarrel between the people of Chaeronea and the 
<A NAME="55"></A>Orchomenians, their neighbours, these latter hired an informer, a Roman, 
<A NAME="56"></A>to accuse the community of Chaeronea as if it had been a single person 
<A NAME="57"></A>of the murder of the Romans, of which only Damon and his companions were 
<A NAME="58"></A>guilty; accordingly, the process was commenced, and the cause pleaded before 
<A NAME="59"></A>the Praetor of Macedon, since the Romans as yet had not sent governors 
<A NAME="60"></A>into Greece.
<A NAME="61"></A><BR><BR>The advocates who defended the inhabitants appealed to the testimony 
<A NAME="62"></A>of Lucullus, who, in answer to a letter the praetor wrote to him, returned 
<A NAME="63"></A>a true account of the matter-of-fact. By this means the town obtained its 
<A NAME="64"></A>acquittal, and escaped a most serious danger. The citizens, thus preserved, 
<A NAME="65"></A>erected a statue to Lucullus in the market-place, near that of the god 
<A NAME="66"></A>Bacchus.
<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR>We also have the same impressions of gratitude; and though removed 
<A NAME="68"></A>from the events by the distance of several generations, we yet feel the 
<A NAME="69"></A>obligation to extend to ourselves: and as we think an image of the character 
<A NAME="70"></A>and habits to be a greater honour than one merely representing the face 
<A NAME="71"></A>and the person, we will put Lucullus's life amongst our parallels of illustrious 
<A NAME="72"></A>men, and without swerving from the truth, will record his actions. The 
<A NAME="73"></A>commemoration will be itself a sufficient proof of our grateful feeling, 
<A NAME="74"></A>and he himself would not thank us, if in recompense for a service which 
<A NAME="75"></A>consisted in speaking the truth, we should abuse his memory with a false 
<A NAME="76"></A>and counterfeit narration. For as we would wish that a painter who is to 
<A NAME="77"></A>draw a beautiful face, in which there is yet some imperfection, should 
<A NAME="78"></A>neither wholly leave out, nor yet too pointedly express what is defective, 
<A NAME="79"></A>because this would deform it, and that spoil the resemblance; so since 
<A NAME="80"></A>it is hard, or indeed perhaps impossible, to show the life of a man wholly 
<A NAME="81"></A>free from blemish, in all that is excellent we must follow truth exactly, 
<A NAME="82"></A>and give it fully; any lapses or faults that occur, through human passions 
<A NAME="83"></A>or political necessities, we may regard rather as the shortcomings of some 
<A NAME="84"></A>particular virtue, than as the natural effects of vice; and may be content 
<A NAME="85"></A>without introducing them, curiously and officiously, into our narrative, 
<A NAME="86"></A>if it be but out of tenderness to the weakness of nature, which has never 
<A NAME="87"></A>succeeded in producing any human character so perfect in virtue as to be 
<A NAME="88"></A>pure from all admixture and open to no criticism. On considering with myself 
<A NAME="89"></A>to whom I should compare Lucullus I find none so exactly his parallel as 
<A NAME="90"></A>Cimon.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR>They were both valiant in war, and successful against the barbarians; 
<A NAME="92"></A>both gentle in political life, and more than any others gave their countrymen 
<A NAME="93"></A>a respite from civil troubles at home, while abroad each of them raised 
<A NAME="94"></A>trophies and gained famous victories. No Greek before Cimon, nor Roman 
<A NAME="95"></A>before Lucullus, ever carried the scene of war so far from their own country; 
<A NAME="96"></A>putting out of the question the acts of Bacchus and Hercules, and any exploit 
<A NAME="97"></A>of Perseus against the Ethiopians, Medes, and Armenians, or again of Jason, 
<A NAME="98"></A>of which any record that deserves credit can be said to have come down 
<A NAME="99"></A>to our days. Moreover in this they were alike, that they did not finish 
<A NAME="100"></A>the enterprises they undertook. They brought their enemies near their ruin, 
<A NAME="101"></A>but never entirely conquered them. There was yet a great conformity in 
<A NAME="102"></A>the free good-will and lavish abundance of their entertainments and general 
<A NAME="103"></A>hospitalities, and in the youthful laxity of their habits. Other points 
<A NAME="104"></A>of resemblance, which we have failed to notice, may be easily collected 
<A NAME="105"></A>from our narrative itself.
<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR>Cimon was the son of Miltiades and Hegesipyle, who was by birth 
<A NAME="107"></A>a Thracian, and daughter to the King Olorus, as appears from the poems 
<A NAME="108"></A>of Melanthius and Archelaus, written in praise of Cimon. By this means 
<A NAME="109"></A>the historian Thucydides was his kinsman by the mother's side; for his 
<A NAME="110"></A>father's name also, in remembrance of this common ancestor, was Olorus, 
<A NAME="111"></A>and he was the owner of the gold mines in Thrace, and met his death, it 
<A NAME="112"></A>is said, by violence, in Scapte Hyle, a district of Thrace; and his remains 
<A NAME="113"></A>having afterwards been brought into Attica, a monument is shown as his 
<A NAME="114"></A>among those of the family of Cimon, near the tomb of Elpinice, Cimon's 
<A NAME="115"></A>sister. But Thucydides was of the township of Halimus, and Miltiades and 
<A NAME="116"></A>his family were Laciadae. Miltiades, being condemned in a fine of fifty 
<A NAME="117"></A>talents of the state, and unable to pay it, was cast into prison, and there 
<A NAME="118"></A>died. Thus Cimon was left an orphan very young, with his sister Elpinice, 
<A NAME="119"></A>who was also young and unmarried. And at first he had but an indifferent 
<A NAME="120"></A>reputation, being looked upon as disorderly in his habits, fond of drinking, 
<A NAME="121"></A>and resembling his grandfather, also called Cimon, in character, whose 
<A NAME="122"></A>simplicity got him the surname of Coalemus. Stesimbrotus of Thasos, who 
<A NAME="123"></A>lived near about the same time with Cimon, reports of him that he had little 
<A NAME="124"></A>acquaintance either with music, or any of the other liberal studies and 
<A NAME="125"></A>accomplishments, then common among the Greeks; that he had nothing whatever 
<A NAME="126"></A>of the quickness and the ready speech of his countrymen in Attica; that 
<A NAME="127"></A>he had great nobleness and candour in his disposition, and in his character 
<A NAME="128"></A>in general resembled rather a native of Peloponnesus than of Athens; as 
<A NAME="129"></A>Euripides describes Hercules-
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR>"----Rude
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>And unrefined, for great things well endued:" for this may fairly be 
<A NAME="132"></A>added to the character which Stesimbrotus has given of 
<A NAME="133"></A>him.
<A NAME="134"></A><BR><BR>They accused him, in his younger years, of cohabiting with his 
<A NAME="135"></A>own sister Elpinice, who, indeed, otherwise had no very clear reputation, 
<A NAME="136"></A>but was reported to have been over-intimate with Polygnotus the painter; 
<A NAME="137"></A>and hence, when he painted the Trojan women in the porch, then called the 
<A NAME="138"></A>Plesianactium, and now the Poecile, he made Laodice a portrait of her. 
<A NAME="139"></A>Polygnotus was not an ordinary mechanic, nor was he paid for his work, 
<A NAME="140"></A>but out of a desire to please the Athenians painted the portico for nothing. 
<A NAME="141"></A>So it is stated by the historians, and in the following verses by the poet 
<A NAME="142"></A>Melanthius:-
<A NAME="143"></A><BR><BR>"Wrought by his hand the deeds of heroes grace
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>At his own charge our temples and our place." Some affirm that Elpinice 
<A NAME="145"></A>lived with her brother, not secretly, but as his married wife, her poverty 
<A NAME="146"></A>excluding her from any suitable match. But afterwards, when Callias, one 
<A NAME="147"></A>of the richest men of Athens, fell in love with her, and proffered to pay 
<A NAME="148"></A>the fine the father was condemned in, if he could obtain the daughter in 
<A NAME="149"></A>marriage, with Elpinice's own consent, Cimon betrothed her to Callias. 
<A NAME="150"></A>There is no doubt but that Cimon was, in general, of an amorous temper. 
<A NAME="151"></A>For Melanthius, in his elegies, rallies him on his attachment for Asteria 
<A NAME="152"></A>of Salamis, and again for a certain Mnestra. And there can be no doubt 
<A NAME="153"></A>of his unusually passionate affection for his lawful wife Isodice, the 
<A NAME="154"></A>daughter of Euryptolemus, the son of Megacles; nor of his regret, even 
<A NAME="155"></A>to impatience, at her death, if any conclusion may be drawn from those 
<A NAME="156"></A>elegies of condolence, addressed to him upon his loss of her. The philosopher 
<A NAME="157"></A>Panaetius is of opinion that Archelaus, the writer on physics, was the 
<A NAME="158"></A>author of them, and indeed the time seems to favour that conjecture. All 
<A NAME="159"></A>the other points of Cimon's character were noble and good. He was as daring 
<A NAME="160"></A>as Miltiades, and not inferior to Themistocles in judgment, and was incomparably 
<A NAME="161"></A>more just and honest than either of them. Fully their equal in all military 
<A NAME="162"></A>virtues, in the ordinary duties of a citizen at home he was immeasurably 
<A NAME="163"></A>their superior. And this, too, when he was very young, his years not yet 
<A NAME="164"></A>strengthened by any experience. For when Themistocles, upon the Median 
<A NAME="165"></A>invasion, advised the Athenians to forsake their city and their country, 
<A NAME="166"></A>and to carry all their arms on shipboard and fight the enemy by sea, in 
<A NAME="167"></A>the straits of Salamis; when all the people stood amazed at the confidence 
<A NAME="168"></A>and rashness of this advice, Cimon was seen, the first of all men, passing 
<A NAME="169"></A>with a cheerful countenance through the Ceramicus, on his way with his 
<A NAME="170"></A>companions to the citadel, carrying a bridle in his hand to offer to the 
<A NAME="171"></A>goddess, intimating that there was no more need of horsemen now, but of 
<A NAME="172"></A>mariners. There, after he had paid his devotions to the goddess, and offered 
<A NAME="173"></A>up the bridle, he took down one of the bucklers that hung upon the walls 
<A NAME="174"></A>of the temple, and went down to the port; by this example giving confidence 
<A NAME="175"></A>to many of the citizens. He was also of a fairly handsome person, according 
<A NAME="176"></A>to the poet Ion, tall and large, and let his thick and curly hair grow 
<A NAME="177"></A>long. After he had acquitted himself gallantly in this battle of Salamis, 
<A NAME="178"></A>he obtained great repute among the Athenians, and was regarded with affection, 
<A NAME="179"></A>as well as admiration. He had many who followed after him, and bade him 
<A NAME="180"></A>aspire to actions not less famous than his father's battle of Marathon. 
<A NAME="181"></A>And when he came forward in political life, the people welcomed him gladly, 
<A NAME="182"></A>being now weary of Themistocles; in opposition to whom, and because of 
<A NAME="183"></A>the frankness and easiness of his temper, which was agreeable to every 
<A NAME="184"></A>one, they advanced Cimon to the highest employments in the government. 
<A NAME="185"></A>The man that contributed most to his promotion was Aristides, who early 
<A NAME="186"></A>discerned in his character his natural capacity, and purposely raised him, 
<A NAME="187"></A>that he might be a counterpoise to the craft and boldness of 
<A NAME="188"></A>Themistocles.
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR>After the Medes had been driven out of Greece, Cimon was sent out 
<A NAME="190"></A>as an admiral, when the Athenians had not yet attained their dominion by 
<A NAME="191"></A>sea, but still followed Pausanias and the Lacedaemonians; and his fellow-citizens 
<A NAME="192"></A>under his command were highly distinguished, both for the excellence of 
<A NAME="193"></A>their discipline, and for their extraordinary zeal and readiness. And further, 
<A NAME="194"></A>perceiving that Pausanias was carrying on secret communications with the 
<A NAME="195"></A>barbarians, and writing letters to the King of Persia to betray Greece, 
<A NAME="196"></A>and puffed up with authority and success, was treating the allies haughtily, 
<A NAME="197"></A>and committing many wanton injustices, Cimon, taking this advantage, by 
<A NAME="198"></A>acts of kindness to those who were suffering wrong, and by his general 
<A NAME="199"></A>humane bearing, robbed him of the command of the Greeks, before he was 
<A NAME="200"></A>aware, not by arms, but by his mere language and character. The greatest 
<A NAME="201"></A>part of the allies, no longer able to endure the harshness and pride of 
<A NAME="202"></A>Pausanias, revolted from him to Cimon and Aristides, who accepted the duty, 
<A NAME="203"></A>and wrote to the Ephors of Sparta, desiring them to recall a man who was 
<A NAME="204"></A>causing dishonour to Sparta and trouble to Greece. They tell of Pausanias, 
<A NAME="205"></A>that when he was in Byzantium, he solicited a young lady of a noble family 
<A NAME="206"></A>in the city, whose name was Cleonice, to debauch her. Her parents, dreading 
<A NAME="207"></A>his cruelty, were forced to consent, and so abandoned their daughter to 
<A NAME="208"></A>his wishes. The daughter asked the servants outside the chamber to put 
<A NAME="209"></A>out all the lights; so that approaching silently and in the dark towards 
<A NAME="210"></A>his bed, she stumbled upon the lamp, which she overturned. Pausanias, who 
<A NAME="211"></A>was fallen asleep, awakened and, startled with the noise, thought an assassin 
<A NAME="212"></A>had taken that dead time of night to murder him, so that hastily snatching 
<A NAME="213"></A>up his poniard that lay by him, he struck the girl, who fell with the blow, 
<A NAME="214"></A>and died. After this, he never had rest, but was continually haunted by 
<A NAME="215"></A>her, and saw an apparition visiting him in his sleep, and addressing him 
<A NAME="216"></A>with these angry words:-
<A NAME="217"></A><BR><BR>"Go on thy way, unto the evil end,
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>That doth on lust and violence attend." This was one of the chief occasions 
<A NAME="219"></A>of indignation against him among the confederates, who now, joining their 
<A NAME="220"></A>resentments and forces with Cimon's, besieged him in Byzantium. He escaped 
<A NAME="221"></A>out of their hands, and, continuing, as it is said, to be disturbed by 
<A NAME="222"></A>the apparition, fled to the oracle of the dead at Heraclea, raised the 
<A NAME="223"></A>ghost of Cleonice, and entreated her to be reconciled. Accordingly she 
<A NAME="224"></A>appeared to him, and answered that, as soon as he came to Sparta, he should 
<A NAME="225"></A>speedily be freed from all evils; obscurely foretelling, it would seem, 
<A NAME="226"></A>his imminent death. This story is related by many authors.
<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR>Cimon, strengthened with the accession of the allies, went as general 
<A NAME="228"></A>into Thrace. For he was told that some great men among the Persians, of 
<A NAME="229"></A>the king's kindred, being in possession of Eion, a city situated upon the 
<A NAME="230"></A>river Strymon, infested the neighbouring Greeks. First he defeated these 
<A NAME="231"></A>Persians in battle, and shut them up within the walls of their town. Then 
<A NAME="232"></A>he fell upon the Thracians of the country beyond the Strymon, because they 
<A NAME="233"></A>supplied Eion with victuals, and driving them entirely out of the country, 
<A NAME="234"></A>took possession of it as conqueror, by which means he reduced the besieged 
<A NAME="235"></A>to such straits, that Butes, who commanded there for the king, in desperation 
<A NAME="236"></A>set fire to the town, and burned himself, his goods, and all his relations, 
<A NAME="237"></A>in one common flame. By this means, Cimon got the town, but no great booty; 
<A NAME="238"></A>as the barbarians had not only consumed themselves in the fire, but the 
<A NAME="239"></A>richest of their effects. However, he put the country about into the hands 
<A NAME="240"></A>of the Athenians, a most advantageous and desirable situation for a settlement. 
<A NAME="241"></A>For this action, the people permitted him to erect the stone Mercuries, 
<A NAME="242"></A>upon the first of which was this inscription:-
<A NAME="243"></A><BR><BR>"Of bold and patient spirit, too, were those,
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>Who, where the Strymon under Eion flows,
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>With famine and the sword, to utmost need,
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>Reduced at last the children of the Mede." Upon the second stood 
<A NAME="247"></A>this:-
<A NAME="248"></A><BR><BR>"The Athenians to their leaders this reward
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>For great and useful service did accord;
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>Others hereafter shall, from their applause,
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>Learn to be valiant in their country's cause." And upon the third the 
<A NAME="252"></A>following:-
<A NAME="253"></A><BR><BR>"With Atreus' sons, this city sent of yore
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>Divine Menestheus to the Trojan shore;
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>Of all the Greeks, so Homer's verses say,
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>The ablest man an army to array:
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>So old the title of her sons the name
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>Of chiefs and champions in the field to claim."
<A NAME="259"></A><BR><BR>Though the name of Cimon is not mentioned in these inscriptions, 
<A NAME="260"></A>yet his contemporaries considered them to be the very highest honours to 
<A NAME="261"></A>him; as neither Miltiades nor Themistocles ever received the like. When 
<A NAME="262"></A>Miltiades claimed a garland, Sochares of Decelea stood up in the midst 
<A NAME="263"></A>of the assembly and opposed it, using words which, though ungracious, were 
<A NAME="264"></A>received with applause by the people: "When you have gained a victory by 
<A NAME="265"></A>yourself, Miltiades, then you may ask to triumph so too." What then induced 
<A NAME="266"></A>them so particularly to honour Cimon? Was it that under other commanders 
<A NAME="267"></A>they stood upon the defensive? but by his conduct, they not only attacked 
<A NAME="268"></A>their enemies, but invaded them in their own country, and acquired new 
<A NAME="269"></A>territory, becoming masters of Eion and Amphipolis, where they planted 
<A NAME="270"></A>colonies, as also they did in the isle of Scyros, which Cimon had taken 
<A NAME="271"></A>on the following occasion. The Dolopians were the inhabitants of this isle, 
<A NAME="272"></A>a people who neglected all husbandry, and had, for many generations, been 
<A NAME="273"></A>devoted to piracy; this they practised to that degree, that at last they 
<A NAME="274"></A>began to plunder foreigners that brought merchandise into their ports. 
<A NAME="275"></A>Some merchants of Thessaly, who had come to shore near to Ctesium, were 
<A NAME="276"></A>not only spoiled of their goods, but themselves put into confinement. These 
<A NAME="277"></A>men afterwards escaping from their prison, went and obtained sentence against 
<A NAME="278"></A>the Scyrians in a court of Amphictyons, and when the Scyrian people declined 
<A NAME="279"></A>to make public restitution, and called upon the individuals who had got 
<A NAME="280"></A>the plunder to give it up, these persons, in alarm, wrote to Cimon to succour 
<A NAME="281"></A>them, with his fleet, and declared themselves ready to deliver the town 
<A NAME="282"></A>into his hands. Cimon, by these means, got the town, expelled the Dolopian 
<A NAME="283"></A>pirates, and so opened the traffic of the Aegean sea. And, understanding 
<A NAME="284"></A>that the ancient Theseus, the son of Aegeus, when he fled from Athens and 
<A NAME="285"></A>took refuge in this isle, was here treacherously slain by King Lycomedes, 
<A NAME="286"></A>who feared him, Cimon endeavoured to find out where he was buried. For 
<A NAME="287"></A>an oracle had commanded the Athenians to bring home his ashes, and pay 
<A NAME="288"></A>him all due honours as a hero; but hitherto they had not been able to learn 
<A NAME="289"></A>where he was interred, as the people of Scyros dissembled the knowledge 
<A NAME="290"></A>of it, and were not willing to allow a search. But now, great inquiry being 
<A NAME="291"></A>made, with some difficulty he found out the tomb and carried the relics 
<A NAME="292"></A>into his own galley, and with great pomp and show brought them to Athens, 
<A NAME="293"></A>four hundred years, or thereabouts, after his expulsion. This act got Cimon 
<A NAME="294"></A>great favour with the people, one mark of which was the judgment, afterwards 
<A NAME="295"></A>so famous, upon the tragic poets. Sophocles, still a young man, had just 
<A NAME="296"></A>brought forward his first plays; opinions were much divided, and the spectators 
<A NAME="297"></A>had taken sides with some heat. So, to determine the case, Apsephion, who 
<A NAME="298"></A>was at that time archon, would not cast lots who should be judges; but 
<A NAME="299"></A>when Cimon and his brother commanders with him came into the theatre, after 
<A NAME="300"></A>they had performed the usual rites to the god of the festival, he would 
<A NAME="301"></A>not allow them to retire, but came forward and made them swear (being ten 
<A NAME="302"></A>in all, one from each tribe) the usual oath; and so being sworn judges, 
<A NAME="303"></A>he made them sit down to give sentence. The eagerness for victory grew 
<A NAME="304"></A>all the warmer from the ambition to get the suffrages of such honourable 
<A NAME="305"></A>judges. And the victory was at last adjudged to Sophocles, which Aeschylus 
<A NAME="306"></A>is said to have taken so ill, that he left Athens shortly after, and went 
<A NAME="307"></A>in anger to Sicily, where he died, and was buried near the city of 
<A NAME="308"></A>Gela.
<A NAME="309"></A><BR><BR>Ion relates that when he was a young man, and recently come from 
<A NAME="310"></A>Chios to Athens, he chanced to sup with Cimon at Laomedon's house. After 
<A NAME="311"></A>supper, when they had, according to custom, poured out wine to the honour 
<A NAME="312"></A>of the gods, Cimon was desired by the company to give them a song, which 
<A NAME="313"></A>he did with sufficient success, and received the commendations of the company, 
<A NAME="314"></A>who remarked on his superiority to Themistocles, who, on a like occasion, 
<A NAME="315"></A>had declared he had never learnt to sing, nor to play, and only knew how 
<A NAME="316"></A>to make a city rich and powerful. After talking of things incident to such 
<A NAME="317"></A>entertainments, they entered upon the particulars of the several actions 
<A NAME="318"></A>for which Cimon had been famous. And when they were mentioning the most 
<A NAME="319"></A>signal, he told them they had omitted one, upon which he valued himself 
<A NAME="320"></A>most for address and good contrivance. He gave this account of it. When 
<A NAME="321"></A>the allies had taken a great number of the barbarians prisoners in Sestos 
<A NAME="322"></A>and Byzantium, they gave him the preference to divide the booty; he accordingly 
<A NAME="323"></A>put the prisoners in one lot, and the spoils of their rich attire and jewels 
<A NAME="324"></A>in the other. This the allies complained of as an unequal division; but 
<A NAME="325"></A>he gave them their choice to take which lot they would, for that the Athenians 
<A NAME="326"></A>should be content with that which they refused. Herophytus of Samos advised 
<A NAME="327"></A>them to take the ornaments for their share, and leave the slaves to the 
<A NAME="328"></A>Athenians; and Cimon went away, and was much laughed at for his ridiculous 
<A NAME="329"></A>division. For the allies carried away the golden bracelets, and armlets, 
<A NAME="330"></A>and collars, and purple robes, and the Athenians had only the naked bodies 
<A NAME="331"></A>of the captives, which they could make no advantage of, being unused to 
<A NAME="332"></A>labour. But a little while after, the friends and kinsmen of the prisoners 
<A NAME="333"></A>coming from Lydia and Phrygia, redeemed everyone his relations at a high 
<A NAME="334"></A>ransom; so that by this means Cimon got so much treasure that he maintained 
<A NAME="335"></A>his whole fleet of galleys with the money for four months; and yet there 
<A NAME="336"></A>was some left to lay up in the treasury at Athens.
<A NAME="337"></A><BR><BR>Cimon now grew rich, and what he gained from the barbarians with 
<A NAME="338"></A>honour, he spent yet more honourably upon the citizens. For he pulled down 
<A NAME="339"></A>all the enclosures of his gardens and grounds, that strangers, and the 
<A NAME="340"></A>needy of his fellow-citizens, might gather of his fruits freely. At home 
<A NAME="341"></A>he kept a table, plain, but sufficient for a considerable number; to which 
<A NAME="342"></A>any poor townsman had free access, and so might support himself without 
<A NAME="343"></A>labour, with his whole time left free for public duties. Aristotle states, 
<A NAME="344"></A>however, that this reception did not extend to all the Athenians, but only 
<A NAME="345"></A>to his own fellow-townsmen, the Laciadae. Besides this, he always went 
<A NAME="346"></A>attended by two or three young companions, very well clad; and if he met 
<A NAME="347"></A>with an elderly citizen in a poor habit, one of these would change clothes 
<A NAME="348"></A>with the decayed citizen, which was looked upon as very nobly done. He 
<A NAME="349"></A>enjoined them, likewise, to carry a considerable quantity of coin about 
<A NAME="350"></A>them, which they were to convey silently into the hands of the better class 
<A NAME="351"></A>of poor men, as they stood by them in the market-place. This, Cratinus 
<A NAME="352"></A>the poet speaks of in one of his comedies, the Archilochi-
<A NAME="353"></A><BR><BR>"For I, Metrobius too, the scrivener poor,
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>Of ease and comfort in my age secure
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>By Greece's noblest son in life's decline,
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>Cimon, the generous-hearted, the divine,
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>Well-fed and feasted hoped till death to be,
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>Death which, alas! has taken him ere me."
<A NAME="359"></A><BR><BR>Gorgias the Leontine gives him this character, that he got riches 
<A NAME="360"></A>that he might use them, and used them that he might get honour by them. 
<A NAME="361"></A>And Critias, one of the thirty tyrants, makes it, in his elegies, his wish 
<A NAME="362"></A>to have-
<A NAME="363"></A><BR><BR>"The Scopads' wealth, and Cimon's nobleness,
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>And King Agesilaus's success."
<A NAME="365"></A><BR><BR>Lichas, we know, became famous in Greece, only because on the days 
<A NAME="366"></A>of the sports, when the young boys run naked, he used to entertain the 
<A NAME="367"></A>strangers that came to see these diversions. But Cimon's generosity outdid 
<A NAME="368"></A>all the old Athenian hospitality and good-nature. For though it is the 
<A NAME="369"></A>city's just boast that their forefathers taught the rest of Greece to sow 
<A NAME="370"></A>corn, and how to use springs of water, and to kindle fire, yet Cimon, by 
<A NAME="371"></A>keeping open house for his fellow-citizens, and giving travellers liberty 
<A NAME="372"></A>to eat the fruits which the several seasons produced in his land, seemed 
<A NAME="373"></A>to restore to the world that community of goods, which mythology says existed 
<A NAME="374"></A>in the reign of Saturn. Those who object to him, that he did this to be 
<A NAME="375"></A>popular and gain the applause of the vulgar, are confuted by the constant 
<A NAME="376"></A>tenor of the rest of his actions, which all tended to uphold the interests 
<A NAME="377"></A>of the nobility and the Spartan policy, of which he gave instances, when 
<A NAME="378"></A>together with Aristides he opposed Themistocles, who was advancing the 
<A NAME="379"></A>authority of the people beyond its just limits, and resisted Ephialtes, 
<A NAME="380"></A>who, to please the multitude, was for abolishing the jurisdiction of the 
<A NAME="381"></A>court of Areopagus. And when all of this time, except Aristides and Ephialtes, 
<A NAME="382"></A>enriched themselves out of the public money, he still kept his hands clean 
<A NAME="383"></A>and untainted, and to his last day never acted or spoke for his own private 
<A NAME="384"></A>gain or emolument. They tell us that Rhoesaces, a Persian, who had traitorously 
<A NAME="385"></A>revolted from the king his master, fled to Athens, and there, being harassed 
<A NAME="386"></A>by sycophants, who were still accusing him to the people, he applied himself 
<A NAME="387"></A>to Cimon for redress, and, to gain his favour, laid down in his doorway 
<A NAME="388"></A>two cups, the one full of gold and the other of silver Darics. Cimon smiled 
<A NAME="389"></A>and asked him whether he wished to have Cimon's hired service or his friendship. 
<A NAME="390"></A>He replied, his friendship. "If so," said he, "take away these pieces, 
<A NAME="391"></A>for, being your friend, when I shall have occasion for them, I will send 
<A NAME="392"></A>and ask for them."
<A NAME="393"></A><BR><BR>The allies of the Athenians began now to be weary of war and military 
<A NAME="394"></A>service, willing to have repose, and to look after their husbandry and 
<A NAME="395"></A>traffic. For they saw their enemies driven out of the country, and did 
<A NAME="396"></A>not fear any new vexations from them. They still paid the tax they were 
<A NAME="397"></A>assessed at, but did not send men and galleys, as they had done before. 
<A NAME="398"></A>This the other Athenian generals wished to constrain them to, and by judicial 
<A NAME="399"></A>proceedings against defaulters, and penalties which they inflicted on them, 
<A NAME="400"></A>made the government uneasy, and even odious. But Cimon practised a contrary 
<A NAME="401"></A>method; he forced no man to go that was not willing, but of those that 
<A NAME="402"></A>desired to be excused from service he took money and vessels unmanned, 
<A NAME="403"></A>and let them yield to the temptation of staying at home, to attend to their 
<A NAME="404"></A>private business. Thus they lost their military habits and luxury, and 
<A NAME="405"></A>their own folly quickly changed them into unwarlike husbandmen and traders; 
<A NAME="406"></A>while Cimon, continually embarking large numbers of Athenians on board 
<A NAME="407"></A>his galleys, thoroughly disciplined them in his expeditions, and ere long 
<A NAME="408"></A>made them the lords of their own paymasters. The allies, whose indolence 
<A NAME="409"></A>maintained them, while they thus went sailing about everywhere, and incessantly 
<A NAME="410"></A>bearing arms and acquiring skill, began to fear and flatter them, and found 
<A NAME="411"></A>themselves after a while allies no longer, but unwittingly become tributaries 
<A NAME="412"></A>and slaves.
<A NAME="413"></A><BR><BR>Nor did any man ever do more than Cimon did to humble the pride 
<A NAME="414"></A>of the Persian king. He was not content with getting rid of him out of 
<A NAME="415"></A>Greece; but following close at his heels, before the barbarians could take 
<A NAME="416"></A>breath and recover themselves, he was already at work, and what with his 
<A NAME="417"></A>devastations, and his forcible reduction of some places, and the revolts 
<A NAME="418"></A>and voluntary accession of others, in the end, from Ionia to Pamphylia, 
<A NAME="419"></A>all Asia was clear of Persian soldiers. Word being brought him that the 
<A NAME="420"></A>royal commanders were lying in wait upon the coast of Pamphylia with a 
<A NAME="421"></A>numerous land army and a large fleet, he determined to make the whole sea 
<A NAME="422"></A>on his side the Chelidonian islands so formidable to them that they should 
<A NAME="423"></A>never dare to show themselves in it; and setting off from Cnidos and the 
<A NAME="424"></A>Triopian headland with two hundred galleys, which had been originally built 
<A NAME="425"></A>with particular care by Themistocles, for speed and rapid evolutions, and 
<A NAME="426"></A>to which he now gave greater width and roomier decks along the sides to 
<A NAME="427"></A>move to and fro upon, so as to allow a great number of full-armed soldiers 
<A NAME="428"></A>to take part in the engagements and fight from them, he shaped his course 
<A NAME="429"></A>first of all against the town of Phaselis, which though inhabited by Greeks, 
<A NAME="430"></A>yet would not quit the interests of Persia, but denied his galleys entrance 
<A NAME="431"></A>into their port. Upon this he wasted the country, and drew up his army 
<A NAME="432"></A>to their very walls; but the soldiers of Chios, who were then serving under 
<A NAME="433"></A>him, being ancient friends to the Phaselites, endeavouring to propitiate 
<A NAME="434"></A>the general in their behalf, at the same time shot arrows into the town, 
<A NAME="435"></A>to which were fastened letters conveying intelligence. At length he concluded 
<A NAME="436"></A>peace with them, upon the conditions that they should pay down ten talents, 
<A NAME="437"></A>and follow him against the barbarians. Ephorus says the admiral of the 
<A NAME="438"></A>Persian fleet was Tithraustes, and the general of the land army Pherendates; 
<A NAME="439"></A>but Callisthenes is positive that Ariomandes, the son of Gobryas, had the 
<A NAME="440"></A>supreme command of all the forces. He lay waiting with the whole fleet 
<A NAME="441"></A>at the mouth of the river Eurymedon, with no design to fight, but expecting 
<A NAME="442"></A>a reinforcement of eighty Phoenician ships on their way from Cyprus. Cimon, 
<A NAME="443"></A>aware of this, put out to sea, resolved, if they would not fight a battle 
<A NAME="444"></A>willingly, to force them to it. The barbarians, seeing this, retired within 
<A NAME="445"></A>the mouth of the river to avoid being attacked; but when they saw the Athenians 
<A NAME="446"></A>come upon them, notwithstanding their retreat, they met them with six hundred 
<A NAME="447"></A>ships, as Phanodemus relates, but, according to Ephorus, only with three 
<A NAME="448"></A>hundred and fifty. However, they did nothing worthy such mighty forces, 
<A NAME="449"></A>but immediately turned the prows of their galleys toward the shore, where 
<A NAME="450"></A>those that came first threw themselves upon the land, and fled to their 
<A NAME="451"></A>army drawn up thereabout, while the rest perished with their vessel or 
<A NAME="452"></A>were taken. By this, one may guess at their number, for though a great 
<A NAME="453"></A>many escaped out of the fight, and a great many others were sunk, yet two 
<A NAME="454"></A>hundred galleys were taken by the Athenians.
<A NAME="455"></A><BR><BR>When their land army drew toward the seaside, Cimon was in suspense 
<A NAME="456"></A>whether he should venture to try and force his way on shore; as he should 
<A NAME="457"></A>thus expose his Greeks, wearied with slaughter in the first engagement, 
<A NAME="458"></A>to the swords of the barbarians, who were all fresh men, and many times 
<A NAME="459"></A>their number. But seeing his men resolute, and flushed with victory, he 
<A NAME="460"></A>bade them land, though they were not yet cool from their first battle. 
<A NAME="461"></A>As soon as they touched ground, they set up a shout and ran upon the enemy, 
<A NAME="462"></A>who stood firm and sustained the first shock with great courage, so that 
<A NAME="463"></A>the fight was a hard one, and some principal men of the Athenians in rank 
<A NAME="464"></A>and courage were slain. At length, though with much ado, they routed the 
<A NAME="465"></A>barbarians, and killing some, took others prisoners, and plundered all 
<A NAME="466"></A>their tents and pavilions, which were full of rich spoil. Cimon, like a 
<A NAME="467"></A>skilled athlete at the games, having in one day carried off two victories 
<A NAME="468"></A>wherein he surpassed that of Salamis by sea and that of Plataea by land, 
<A NAME="469"></A>was encouraged to try for yet another success. News being brought that 
<A NAME="470"></A>the Phoenician succours, in number eighty sail, had come in sight at Hydrum, 
<A NAME="471"></A>he set off with all speed to find them, while they as yet had not received 
<A NAME="472"></A>any certain account of the larger fleet, and were in doubt what to think; 
<A NAME="473"></A>so that, thus surprised, they lost all their vessels and most of their 
<A NAME="474"></A>men with them. This success of Cimon so daunted the King of Persia that 
<A NAME="475"></A>he presently made that celebrated peace, by which he engaged that his armies 
<A NAME="476"></A>should come no nearer the Grecian sea than the length of a horse's course, 
<A NAME="477"></A>and that none of his galleys or vessels of war should appear between the 
<A NAME="478"></A>Cyanean and Chelidonian isles. Callisthenes, however, says that he did 
<A NAME="479"></A>not agree to any such articles, but that, upon the fear this victory gave 
<A NAME="480"></A>him, he did in reality thus act, and kept off so far from Greece, that 
<A NAME="481"></A>when Pericles with fifty and Ephialtes with thirty galleys cruised beyond 
<A NAME="482"></A>the Chelidonian isles, they did not discover one Persian vessel. But in 
<A NAME="483"></A>the collection which Craterus made of the public acts of the people, there 
<A NAME="484"></A>is a draft of this treaty given. And it is told, also, that at Athens they 
<A NAME="485"></A>erected the altar of Peace upon this occasion, and decreed particular honours 
<A NAME="486"></A>to Callias, who was employed as ambassador to procure the 
<A NAME="487"></A>treaty.
<A NAME="488"></A><BR><BR>The people of Athens raised so much money from the spoils of this 
<A NAME="489"></A>war, which were publicly sold, that besides other expenses, and raising 
<A NAME="490"></A>the south wall of the citadel, they laid the foundation of the long walls, 
<A NAME="491"></A>not, indeed, finished till at a later time, which were called the Legs. 
<A NAME="492"></A>And the place where they built them being soft and marshy ground, they 
<A NAME="493"></A>were forced to sink great weights of stone and rubble to secure the foundation, 
<A NAME="494"></A>and did all this out of the money Cimon supplied them with. It was he, 
<A NAME="495"></A>likewise, who first embellished the upper city with those fine and ornamental 
<A NAME="496"></A>places of exercise and resort, which they afterwards so much frequented 
<A NAME="497"></A>and delighted in. He set the market-place with plane-trees; and the Academy, 
<A NAME="498"></A>which was before a bare, dry, and dirty spot, he converted into a well-watered 
<A NAME="499"></A>grove, with shady alleys to walk in, and open courses for 
<A NAME="500"></A>races.
<A NAME="501"></A><BR><BR>When the Persians who had made themselves masters of the Chersonese, 
<A NAME="502"></A>so far from quitting it, called in the people of the interior of Thrace 
<A NAME="503"></A>to help them against Cimon, whom they despised for the smallness of his 
<A NAME="504"></A>forces, he set upon them with only four galleys, and took thirteen of theirs; 
<A NAME="505"></A>and having driven out the Persians, and subdued the Thracians, he made 
<A NAME="506"></A>the whole Chersonese the property of Athens. Next he attacked the people 
<A NAME="507"></A>of Thasos, who had revolted from the Athenians; and, having defeated them 
<A NAME="508"></A>in a fight at sea, where he took thirty-three of their vessels, he took 
<A NAME="509"></A>their town by siege, and acquired for the Athenians all the mines of gold 
<A NAME="510"></A>on the opposite coast, and the territory dependent on Thasos. This opened 
<A NAME="511"></A>him a fair passage into Macedon, so that he might, it was thought, have 
<A NAME="512"></A>acquired a good portion of that country; and because he neglected the opportunity, 
<A NAME="513"></A>he was suspected of corruption, and of having been bribed off by King Alexander. 
<A NAME="514"></A>So, by the combination of his adversaries, he was accused of being false 
<A NAME="515"></A>to his country. In his defence he told the judges that he had always shown 
<A NAME="516"></A>himself in his public life the friend, not, like other men, of rich Ionians 
<A NAME="517"></A>and Thessalians, to be courted, and to receive presents, but of the Lacedaemonians; 
<A NAME="518"></A>for as he admired, so he wished to imitate, the plainness of their habits, 
<A NAME="519"></A>their temperance, and simplicity of living, which he preferred to any sort 
<A NAME="520"></A>of riches: but that he always had been, and still was, proud to enrich 
<A NAME="521"></A>his country with the spoils of her enemies. Stesimbrotus, making mention 
<A NAME="522"></A>of this trial, states that Elpinice, in behalf of her brother, addressed 
<A NAME="523"></A>herself to Pericles, the most vehement of his accusers, to whom Pericles 
<A NAME="524"></A>answered, with a smile, "You are old, Elpinice, to meddle with affairs 
<A NAME="525"></A>of this nature." However, he proved the mildest of his prosecutors, and 
<A NAME="526"></A>rose up but once all the while, almost as a matter of form, to plead against 
<A NAME="527"></A>him. Cimon was acquitted.
<A NAME="528"></A><BR><BR>In his public life after this he continued, whilst at home, to 
<A NAME="529"></A>control and restrain the common people, who would have trampled upon the 
<A NAME="530"></A>nobility. and drawn all the power and sovereignty to themselves. But when 
<A NAME="531"></A>he afterwards was sent out to war, the multitude broke loose, as it were, 
<A NAME="532"></A>and overthrew all the ancient laws and customs they had hitherto observed, 
<A NAME="533"></A>and, chiefly at the instigation of Ephialtes, withdrew the cognisance of 
<A NAME="534"></A>almost all causes from the Areopagus; so that all jurisdiction now being 
<A NAME="535"></A>transferred to them, the government was reduced to a perfect democracy, 
<A NAME="536"></A>and this by the help of Pericles, who was already powerful, and had pronounced 
<A NAME="537"></A>in favour of the common people. Cimon, when he returned, seeing the authority 
<A NAME="538"></A>of this great council so upset, was exceedingly troubled, and endeavoured 
<A NAME="539"></A>to remedy these disorders by bringing the courts of law to their former 
<A NAME="540"></A>state, and restoring the old aristocracy of the time of Clisthenes. This 
<A NAME="541"></A>the others declaimed against with all the vehemence possible, and began 
<A NAME="542"></A>to revive those stories concerning him and his sister, and cried out against 
<A NAME="543"></A>him as the partisan of the Lacedaemonians. To these calumnies the famous 
<A NAME="544"></A>verses of Eupolis the poet upon Cimon refer:-
<A NAME="545"></A><BR><BR>"He was as good as others that one sees,
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>But he was fond of drinking and of ease;
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>And would at nights to Sparta often roam,
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>Leaving his sister desolate at home."
<A NAME="549"></A><BR><BR>But if, though slothful and a drunkard, he could capture so many 
<A NAME="550"></A>towns and gain so many victories, certainly if he had been sober and minded 
<A NAME="551"></A>his business, there had been no Grecian commander, either before or after 
<A NAME="552"></A>him, that could have surpassed him for exploits of war.
<A NAME="553"></A><BR><BR>He was, indeed, a favourer of the Lacedaemonians, even from his 
<A NAME="554"></A>youth, and he gave the names of Lacedaemonius and Eleus to two sons, twins, 
<A NAME="555"></A>whom he had, as Stesimbrotus says, by a woman of Clitorium, whence Pericles 
<A NAME="556"></A>often upbraided them with their mother's blood. But Diodorus the geographer 
<A NAME="557"></A>asserts that both these, and another son of Cimon's, whose name was Thessalus, 
<A NAME="558"></A>were born of Isodice, the daughter of Euryptolemus, the son of 
<A NAME="559"></A>Megacles.
<A NAME="560"></A><BR><BR>However, this is certain, that Cimon was countenanced by the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="561"></A>in opposition to Themistocles, whom they disliked; and while he was yet 
<A NAME="562"></A>very young, they endeavoured to raise and increase his credit in Athens. 
<A NAME="563"></A>This the Athenians perceived at first with pleasure, and the favour the 
<A NAME="564"></A>Lacedaemonians showed him was in various ways advantageous to them and 
<A NAME="565"></A>their affairs; as at that time they were just rising to power, and were 
<A NAME="566"></A>occupied in winning the allies to their side. So they seemed not at all 
<A NAME="567"></A>offended with the honour and kindness shown to Cimon, who then had the 
<A NAME="568"></A>chief management of all the affairs of Greece, and was acceptable to the 
<A NAME="569"></A>Lacedaemonians, and courteous to the allies. But afterwards the Athenians, 
<A NAME="570"></A>grown more powerful, when they saw Cimon so entirely devoted to the Lacedaemonians, 
<A NAME="571"></A>began to be angry, for he would always in his speeches prefer them to the 
<A NAME="572"></A>Athenians, and upon every occasion, when he would reprimand them for a 
<A NAME="573"></A>fault, or incite them to emulation, he would exclaim, "The Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="574"></A>would not do thus." This raised the discontent, and got him in some degree 
<A NAME="575"></A>the hatred of the citizens; but that which ministered chiefly to the accusation 
<A NAME="576"></A>against him fell out upon the following occasion.
<A NAME="577"></A><BR><BR>In the fourth year of the reign of Archidamus, the son of Zeuxidamus, 
<A NAME="578"></A>King of Sparta, there happened in the country of Lacedaemon the greatest 
<A NAME="579"></A>earthquake that was known in the memory of man; the earth opened into chasms, 
<A NAME="580"></A>and the mountain Taygetus was so shaken, that some of the rocky points 
<A NAME="581"></A>of it fell down, and except five houses, all the town of Sparta was shattered 
<A NAME="582"></A>to pieces. They say that a little before any motion was perceived, as the 
<A NAME="583"></A>young men and the boys just grown up were exercising themselves together 
<A NAME="584"></A>in the middle of the portico, a hare, of a sudden, started out just by 
<A NAME="585"></A>them, which the young men, though all naked and daubed with oil, ran after 
<A NAME="586"></A>for sport. No sooner were they gone from the place, than the gymnasium 
<A NAME="587"></A>fell down upon the boys who had stayed behind, and killed them all. Their 
<A NAME="588"></A>tomb is to this day called Sismatias. Archidamus, by the present danger 
<A NAME="589"></A>made apprehensive of what might follow, and seeing the citizens intent 
<A NAME="590"></A>upon removing the most valuable of their goods out of their houses, commanded 
<A NAME="591"></A>an alarm to be sounded, as if an enemy were coming upon them, in order 
<A NAME="592"></A>that they should collect about him in a body, with arms. It was this alone 
<A NAME="593"></A>that saved Sparta at that time, for the Helots were got together from the 
<A NAME="594"></A>country about, with design to surprise the Spartans, and overpower those 
<A NAME="595"></A>whom the earthquake had spared. But finding them armed and well prepared, 
<A NAME="596"></A>they retired into the towns and openly made war with them, gaining over 
<A NAME="597"></A>a number of the Laconians of the country districts; while at the same time 
<A NAME="598"></A>the Messenians, also, made an attack upon the Spartans, who therefore despatched 
<A NAME="599"></A>Periclidas to Athens to solicit succours, of whom Aristophanes says in 
<A NAME="600"></A>mockery that he came and-
<A NAME="601"></A><BR><BR>"In a red jacket, at the altars seated,
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>With a white face, for men and arms entreated."
<A NAME="603"></A><BR><BR>This Ephialtes opposed, protesting that they ought not to raise 
<A NAME="604"></A>up or assist a city that was a rival to Athens; but that being down, it 
<A NAME="605"></A>were best to keep her so, and let the pride and arrogance of Sparta be 
<A NAME="606"></A>trodden under. But Cimon, as Critias says, preferring the safety of Lacedaemon 
<A NAME="607"></A>to the aggrandisement of his own country, so persuaded the people, that 
<A NAME="608"></A>he soon marched out with a large army to their relief. Ion records, also, 
<A NAME="609"></A>the most successful expression which he used to move the Athenians. "They 
<A NAME="610"></A>ought not to suffer Greece to be lamed, nor their own city to be deprived 
<A NAME="611"></A>of her yoke-fellow."
<A NAME="612"></A><BR><BR>In his return from aiding the Lacedaemonians, he passed with his 
<A NAME="613"></A>army through the territory of Corinth; whereupon Lachartus reproached him 
<A NAME="614"></A>for bringing his army into the country without first asking leave of the 
<A NAME="615"></A>people. For he that knocks at another man's door ought not to enter the 
<A NAME="616"></A>house till the master gives him leave. "But you Corinthians, O Lachartus," 
<A NAME="617"></A>said Cimon, "did not knock at the gates of the Cleonaeans and Megarians, 
<A NAME="618"></A>but broke them down, and entered by force, thinking that all places should 
<A NAME="619"></A>be open to the stronger." And having thus rallied the Corinthian, he passed 
<A NAME="620"></A>on with his army. Some time after this, the Lacedaemonians sent a second 
<A NAME="621"></A>time to desire succours of the Athenians against the Messenians and Helots, 
<A NAME="622"></A>who had seized upon Ithome. But when they came, fearing their boldness 
<A NAME="623"></A>and gallantry, of all that came to their assistance, they sent them only 
<A NAME="624"></A>back, alleging they were designing innovations. The Athenians returned 
<A NAME="625"></A>home, enraged at this usage, and vented their anger upon all those who 
<A NAME="626"></A>were favourers of the Lacedaemonians, and seizing some slight occasion, 
<A NAME="627"></A>they banished Cimon for ten years, which is the time prescribed to those 
<A NAME="628"></A>that are banished by the ostracism. In the meantime, the Lacedaemonians, 
<A NAME="629"></A>on their return after freeing Delphi from the Phocians, encamped their 
<A NAME="630"></A>army at Tanagra, whither the Athenians presently marched with design to 
<A NAME="631"></A>fight them.
<A NAME="632"></A><BR><BR>Cimon, also, came thither armed, and ranged himself among those 
<A NAME="633"></A>of his own tribe which was the Oeneis, desirous of fighting with the rest 
<A NAME="634"></A>against the Spartans; but the council of five hundred being informed of 
<A NAME="635"></A>this, and frighted at it, his adversaries crying out he would disorder 
<A NAME="636"></A>the army, and bring the Lacedaemonians to Athens, commanded the officers 
<A NAME="637"></A>not to receive him. Wherefore Cimon left the army, conjuring Euthippus, 
<A NAME="638"></A>the Anaphlystian, and the rest of his companions, who were most suspected 
<A NAME="639"></A>as favouring the Lacedaemonians, to behave themselves bravely against their 
<A NAME="640"></A>enemies, and by their actions make their innocence evident to their countrymen. 
<A NAME="641"></A>These, being in all a hundred, took the arms of Cimon, and followed his 
<A NAME="642"></A>advice; and making a body by themselves, fought so desperately with the 
<A NAME="643"></A>enemy, that they were all cut off, leaving the Athenians deep regret for 
<A NAME="644"></A>the loss of such brave men, and repentance for having so unjustly suspected 
<A NAME="645"></A>them. Accordingly, they did not long retain their severity toward Cimon, 
<A NAME="646"></A>partly upon remembrance of his former services, and partly, perhaps, induced 
<A NAME="647"></A>by the juncture of the times. For being defeated at Tanagra in a great 
<A NAME="648"></A>battle, and fearing the Peloponnesians would come upon them at the opening 
<A NAME="649"></A>of the spring, they recalled Cimon by a decree, of which Pericles himself 
<A NAME="650"></A>was author. So reasonable were men's resentments in those times, and so 
<A NAME="651"></A>moderate their anger, that it always gave way to the public good. Even 
<A NAME="652"></A>ambition, the least governable of all human passions, could then yield 
<A NAME="653"></A>to the necessities of the state.
<A NAME="654"></A><BR><BR>Cimon, as soon as he returned, put an end to the war, and reconciled 
<A NAME="655"></A>the two cities. Peace thus established, seeing the Athenians impatient 
<A NAME="656"></A>of being idle, and eager after the honour and aggrandisement of war, lest 
<A NAME="657"></A>they should set upon the Greeks themselves, or with so many ships cruising 
<A NAME="658"></A>about the isles and Peloponnesus they should give occasions to intestine 
<A NAME="659"></A>wars, or complaining of their allies against them, he equipped two hundred 
<A NAME="660"></A>galleys, with design to make an attempt upon Egypt and Cyprus; purposing, 
<A NAME="661"></A>by this means, to accustom the Athenians to fight against the barbarians, 
<A NAME="662"></A>and enrich themselves honestly by spoiling those who were the natural enemies 
<A NAME="663"></A>of Greece. But when all things were prepared, and the army ready to embark, 
<A NAME="664"></A>Cimon had this dream. It seemed to him that there was a furious bitch barking 
<A NAME="665"></A>at him, and mixed with the barking a kind of human voice uttered these 
<A NAME="666"></A>words:-
<A NAME="667"></A><BR><BR>"Come on, for thou shalt shortly be,
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>A pleasure to my whelps and me." This dream was hard to interpret, 
<A NAME="669"></A>yet Astyphilus of Posidonia, a man skilled in divinations, and intimate 
<A NAME="670"></A>with Cimon, told him that his death was presaged by this vision, which 
<A NAME="671"></A>he thus explained. A dog is enemy to him he barks at; and one is always 
<A NAME="672"></A>most a pleasure to one's enemies when one is dead; the mixture of human 
<A NAME="673"></A>voice with barking signifies the Medes, for the army of the Medes is mixed 
<A NAME="674"></A>up of Greeks and barbarians. After this dream, as he was sacrificing to 
<A NAME="675"></A>Bacchus, and the priest cutting up the victim, a number of ants, taking 
<A NAME="676"></A>up the congealed particles of the blood, laid them about Cimon's great 
<A NAME="677"></A>toe. This was not observed for a good while, but at the very time when 
<A NAME="678"></A>Cimon spied it, the priest came and showed him the liver of the sacrifice 
<A NAME="679"></A>imperfect, wanting that part of it called the head. But he could not then 
<A NAME="680"></A>recede from the enterprise, so he set sail. Sixty of his ships he sent 
<A NAME="681"></A>toward Egypt; with the rest he went and fought the King of Persia's fleet, 
<A NAME="682"></A>composed of Phoenician and Cilician galleys, recovered all the cities thereabout, 
<A NAME="683"></A>and threatened Egypt; designing no less than the entire ruin of the Persian 
<A NAME="684"></A>empire. And the rather, for that he was informed Themistocles was in great 
<A NAME="685"></A>repute among the barbarians, having promised the king to lead his army, 
<A NAME="686"></A>whenever he should make war upon Greece. But Themistocles, it is said, 
<A NAME="687"></A>abandoning all hopes of compassing his designs, very much out of the despair 
<A NAME="688"></A>of overcoming the valour and good fortune of Cimon, died a voluntary death. 
<A NAME="689"></A>Cimon, intent on great designs, which he was now to enter upon, keeping 
<A NAME="690"></A>his navy about the isle of Cyprus, sent messengers to consult the oracle 
<A NAME="691"></A>of Jupiter Ammon upon some secret matter. For it is not known about what 
<A NAME="692"></A>they were sent, and the god would give them no answer, but commanded them 
<A NAME="693"></A>to return again, for that Cimon was already with him. Hearing this, they 
<A NAME="694"></A>returned to sea, and as soon as they came to the Grecian army, which was 
<A NAME="695"></A>then about Egypt, they understood that Cimon was dead; and computing the 
<A NAME="696"></A>time of the oracle, they found that his death had been signified, he being 
<A NAME="697"></A>then already with the gods.
<A NAME="698"></A><BR><BR>He died, some say, of sickness, while besieging Citium, in Cyprus; 
<A NAME="699"></A>according to others, of a wound he received in a skirmish with the barbarians. 
<A NAME="700"></A>When he perceived he should die he commanded those under his charge to 
<A NAME="701"></A>return, and by no means to let the news of his death be known by the way; 
<A NAME="702"></A>this they did with such secrecy that they all came home safe, and neither 
<A NAME="703"></A>their enemies nor the allies knew what had happened. Thus, as Phanodemus 
<A NAME="704"></A>relates, the Grecian army was, as it were, conducted by Cimon thirty days 
<A NAME="705"></A>after he was dead. But after his death there was not one commander among 
<A NAME="706"></A>the Greeks that did anything considerable against the barbarians, and instead 
<A NAME="707"></A>of uniting against their common enemies, the popular leaders and partisans 
<A NAME="708"></A>of war animated them against one another to that degree, that none could 
<A NAME="709"></A>interpose their good offices to reconcile them. And while, by their mutual 
<A NAME="710"></A>discord, they ruined the power of Greece, they gave the Persians time to 
<A NAME="711"></A>recover breath, and repair all their losses. It is true, indeed, Agesilaus 
<A NAME="712"></A>carried the arms of Greece into Asia, but it was a long time after; there 
<A NAME="713"></A>were, indeed, some brief appearances of a war against the king's lieutenants 
<A NAME="714"></A>in the maritime provinces, but they all quickly vanished; before he could 
<A NAME="715"></A>perform anything of moment, he was recalled by fresh civil dissensions 
<A NAME="716"></A>and disturbances at home. So that he was forced to leave the Persian king's 
<A NAME="717"></A>officers to impose what tribute they pleased on the Greek cities in Asia, 
<A NAME="718"></A>the confederates and allies of the Lacedaemonians. Whereas, in the time 
<A NAME="719"></A>of Cimon, not so much as a letter-carrier, or a single horseman, was ever 
<A NAME="720"></A>seen to come within four hundred furlongs of the sea.
<A NAME="721"></A><BR><BR>The monuments, called Cimonian to this day, in Athens, show that 
<A NAME="722"></A>his remains were conveyed home, yet the inhabitants of the city Citium 
<A NAME="723"></A>pay particular honour to a certain tomb which they call the tomb of Cimon, 
<A NAME="724"></A>according to Nausicrates the rhetorician, who states that in a time of 
<A NAME="725"></A>famine, when the crops of their land all failed, they sent to the oracle, 
<A NAME="726"></A>which commanded them not to forget Cimon, but give him the honours of a 
<A NAME="727"></A>superior being. Such was the Greek commander.
