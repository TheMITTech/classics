<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>There is so much uncertainty in the accounts which historians have left 
<A NAME="11"></A>us of Lycurgus, the lawgiver of Sparta, that scarcely anything is asserted 
<A NAME="12"></A>by one of them which is not called into question or contradicted by the 
<A NAME="13"></A>rest. Their sentiments are quite different as to the family he came of, 
<A NAME="14"></A>the voyages he undertook, the place and manner of his death, but most of 
<A NAME="15"></A>all when they speak of the laws he made and the commonwealth which he founded. 
<A NAME="16"></A>They cannot, by any means, be brought to an agreement as to the very age 
<A NAME="17"></A>in which he lived; for some of them say that he flourished in the time 
<A NAME="18"></A>of Iphitus, and that they two jointly contrived the ordinance for the cessation 
<A NAME="19"></A>of arms during the solemnity of the Olympic games. Of this opinion was 
<A NAME="20"></A>Aristotle; and for confirmation of it, he alleges an inscription upon one 
<A NAME="21"></A>of the copper quoits used in those sports, upon which the name of Lycurgus 
<A NAME="22"></A>continued uneffaced to his time. But Eratosthenes and Apollodorus and other 
<A NAME="23"></A>chronologers, computing the time by the successions of the Spartan kings, 
<A NAME="24"></A>pretend to demonstrate that he was much more ancient than the institution 
<A NAME="25"></A>of the Olympic games. Timaeus conjectures that there were two of this name, 
<A NAME="26"></A>and in diverse times, but that the one of them being much more famous than 
<A NAME="27"></A>the other, men gave to him the glory of the exploits of both; the elder 
<A NAME="28"></A>of the two, according to him, was not long after Homer; and some are so 
<A NAME="29"></A>particular as to say that he had seen him. But that he was of great antiquity 
<A NAME="30"></A>may be gathered from a passage in Xenophon, where he makes him contemporary 
<A NAME="31"></A>with the Heraclidae. By descent, indeed, the very last kings of Sparta 
<A NAME="32"></A>were Heraclidae too; but he seems in that place to speak of the first and 
<A NAME="33"></A>more immediate successors of Hercules. But notwithstanding this confusion 
<A NAME="34"></A>and obscurity, we shall endeavour to compose the history of his life, adhering 
<A NAME="35"></A>to those statements which are least contradicted, and depending upon those 
<A NAME="36"></A>authors who are most worthy of credit.
<A NAME="37"></A><BR><BR>The poet Simonides will have it that Lycurgus was the son of Prytanis, 
<A NAME="38"></A>and not of Eunomus; but in this opinion he is singular, for all the rest 
<A NAME="39"></A>deduce the genealogy of them both as follows:-
<A NAME="40"></A><BR><BR>Aristodemus.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>to
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>Patrocles.
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>to
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>Sous.
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>to
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>Eurypon.
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>to
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>Eunomus
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>/ \
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>Polydectes by his first wife.  Lycurgus by Dionassa his second. Dieuchidas 
<A NAME="51"></A>says he was the sixth from Patrocles and the eleventh from Hercules. Be 
<A NAME="52"></A>this as it will, Sous certainly was the most renowned of all his ancestors, 
<A NAME="53"></A>under whose conduct the Spartans made slaves of the Helots, and added to 
<A NAME="54"></A>their dominions, by conquest, a good part of Arcadia. There goes a story 
<A NAME="55"></A>of this king Sous, that, being besieged by the Clitorians in a dry and 
<A NAME="56"></A>stony place so that he could come at no water, he was at last constrained 
<A NAME="57"></A>to agree with them upon these terms, that he would restore to them all 
<A NAME="58"></A>his conquests, provided that himself and all his men should drink of the 
<A NAME="59"></A>nearest spring. After the usual oaths and ratifications, he called his 
<A NAME="60"></A>soldiers together, and offered to him that would forbear drinking his kingdom 
<A NAME="61"></A>for a reward; and when not a man of them was able to forbear, in short, 
<A NAME="62"></A>when they had all drunk their fill, at last comes King Sous himself to 
<A NAME="63"></A>the spring, and, having sprinkled his face only, without swallowing one 
<A NAME="64"></A>drop, marches off in the face of his enemies, refusing to yield up his 
<A NAME="65"></A>conquests, because himself and all his men had not, according to the articles, 
<A NAME="66"></A>drunk of their water.
<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR>Although he was justly had in admiration on this account, yet his 
<A NAME="68"></A>family was not surnamed from him, but from his son Eurypon (of whom they 
<A NAME="69"></A>were called Eurypontids); the reason of which was that Eurypon relaxed 
<A NAME="70"></A>the rigour of the monarchy, seeking favour and popularity with the many. 
<A NAME="71"></A>They, after this first step, grew bolder; and the succeeding kings partly 
<A NAME="72"></A>incurred hatred with their people by trying to use force, or, for popularity's 
<A NAME="73"></A>sake and through weakness, gave way; and anarchy and confusion long prevailed 
<A NAME="74"></A>in Sparta, causing, moreover, the death of the father of Lycurgus. For 
<A NAME="75"></A>as he was endeavouring to quell a riot, he was stabbed with a butcher's 
<A NAME="76"></A>knife, and left the title of king to his eldest son, 
<A NAME="77"></A>Polydectes.
<A NAME="78"></A><BR><BR>He, too, dying soon after, the right of succession (as every one 
<A NAME="79"></A>thought) rested in Lycurgus; and reign he did, until it was found that 
<A NAME="80"></A>the queen, his sister-in-law, was with child; upon which he immediately 
<A NAME="81"></A>declared that the kingdom belonged to her issue, provided it were male, 
<A NAME="82"></A>and that he himself exercised the regal jurisdiction only as his guardian; 
<A NAME="83"></A>the Spartan name for which office is prodicus. Soon after, an overture 
<A NAME="84"></A>was made to him by the queen, that she would herself in some way destroy 
<A NAME="85"></A>the infant, upon condition that he would marry her when he came to the 
<A NAME="86"></A>crown. Abhorring the woman's wickedness, he nevertheless did not reject 
<A NAME="87"></A>her proposal, but, making show of closing with her, despatched the messenger 
<A NAME="88"></A>with thanks and expressions of joy, but dissuaded her earnestly from procuring 
<A NAME="89"></A>herself to miscarry, which would impair her health, if not endanger her 
<A NAME="90"></A>life; he himself, he said, would see to it, that the child, as soon as 
<A NAME="91"></A>born, should be taken out of the way. By such artifices having drawn on 
<A NAME="92"></A>the woman to the time of her lying-in, as soon as he heard that she was 
<A NAME="93"></A>in labour, he sent persons to be by and observe all that passed, with orders 
<A NAME="94"></A>that if it were a girl they should deliver it to the women, but if a boy, 
<A NAME="95"></A>should bring it to him wheresoever he were, and whatsoever doing. It fell 
<A NAME="96"></A>out that when he was at supper with the principal magistrates the queen 
<A NAME="97"></A>was brought to bed of a boy, who was soon after presented to him as he 
<A NAME="98"></A>was at the table; he, taking him into his arms, said to those about him, 
<A NAME="99"></A>"Men of Sparta, here is a king born unto us;" this said, he laid him down 
<A NAME="100"></A>in the king's place, and named him Charilaus, that is, the joy of the people; 
<A NAME="101"></A>because that all were transported with joy and with wonder at his noble 
<A NAME="102"></A>and just spirit. His reign had lasted only eight months, but he was honoured 
<A NAME="103"></A>on other accounts by the citizens, and there were more who obeyed him because 
<A NAME="104"></A>of his eminent virtues, than because he was regent to the king and had 
<A NAME="105"></A>the royal power in his hands. Some, however, envied and sought to impede 
<A NAME="106"></A>his growing influence while he was still young; chiefly the kindred and 
<A NAME="107"></A>friends of the queen-mother, who pretended to have been dealt with injuriously. 
<A NAME="108"></A>Her brother Leonidas, in a warm debate which fell out betwixt him and Lycurgus, 
<A NAME="109"></A>went so far as to tell him to his face that he was well assured that ere 
<A NAME="110"></A>long he should see him king; suggesting suspicions and preparing the way 
<A NAME="111"></A>for an accusation of him, as though he had made away with his nephew, if 
<A NAME="112"></A>the child should chance to fail, though by a natural death. Words of the 
<A NAME="113"></A>like import were designedly cast abroad by the queen-mother and her 
<A NAME="114"></A>adherents.
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR>Troubled at this, and not knowing what it might come to, he thought 
<A NAME="116"></A>it his wisest course to avoid their envy by a voluntary exile, and to travel 
<A NAME="117"></A>from place to place until his nephew came to marriageable years, and, by 
<A NAME="118"></A>having a son, had secured the succession; setting sail, therefore, with 
<A NAME="119"></A>this resolution, he first arrived at Crete, where, having considered their 
<A NAME="120"></A>several forms of government, and got an acquaintance with the principal 
<A NAME="121"></A>men among them, some of their laws he very much approved of, and resolved 
<A NAME="122"></A>to make use of them in his own country; a good part he rejected as useless. 
<A NAME="123"></A>Among the persons there the most renowned for their learning and their 
<A NAME="124"></A>wisdom in state matters was one Thales, whom Lycurgus, by importunities 
<A NAME="125"></A>and assurances of friendship, persuaded to go over to Lacedaemon; where, 
<A NAME="126"></A>though by his outward appearance and his own profession he seemed to be 
<A NAME="127"></A>no other than a lyric poet, in reality he performed the part of one of 
<A NAME="128"></A>the ablest lawgivers in the world. The very songs which he composed were 
<A NAME="129"></A>exhortations to obedience and concord, and the very measure and cadence 
<A NAME="130"></A>of the verse, conveying impressions of order and tranquillity, had so great 
<A NAME="131"></A>an influence on the minds of the listeners, that they were insensibly softened 
<A NAME="132"></A>and civilized, insomuch that they renounced their private feuds and animosities, 
<A NAME="133"></A>and were reunited in a common admiration of virtue. So that it may truly 
<A NAME="134"></A>be said that Thales prepared the way for the discipline introduced by 
<A NAME="135"></A>Lycurgus.
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>From Crete he sailed to Asia, with design, as is said, to examine 
<A NAME="137"></A>the difference betwixt the manners and rules of life of the Cretans, which 
<A NAME="138"></A>were very sober and temperate, and those of the Ionians, a people of sumptuous 
<A NAME="139"></A>and delicate habits, and so to form a judgment; just as physicians do by 
<A NAME="140"></A>comparing healthy and diseased bodies. Here he had the first sight of Homer's 
<A NAME="141"></A>works, in the hands, we may suppose, of the posterity of Creophylus; and, 
<A NAME="142"></A>having observed that the few loose expressions and actions of ill example 
<A NAME="143"></A>which are to be found in his poems were much outweighed by serious lessons 
<A NAME="144"></A>of state and rules of morality, he set himself eagerly to transcribe and 
<A NAME="145"></A>digest them into order, as thinking they would be of good use in his own 
<A NAME="146"></A>country. They had, indeed, already obtained some slight repute among the 
<A NAME="147"></A>Greeks, and scattered portions, as chance conveyed them, were in the hands 
<A NAME="148"></A>of individuals; but Lycurgus first made them really 
<A NAME="149"></A>known.
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR>The Egyptians say that he took a voyage into Egypt, and that, being 
<A NAME="151"></A>much taken with their way of separating the soldiery from the rest of the 
<A NAME="152"></A>nation, he transferred it from them to Sparta, a removal from contact with 
<A NAME="153"></A>those employed in low and mechanical occupations giving high refinement 
<A NAME="154"></A>and beauty to the state. Some Greek writers also record this. But as for 
<A NAME="155"></A>his voyages into Spain, Africa and the Indies, and his conferences there 
<A NAME="156"></A>with the Gymnosophists, the whole relation, as far as I can find, rests 
<A NAME="157"></A>on the single credit of the Spartan Aristocrates, the son of 
<A NAME="158"></A>Hipparchus.
<A NAME="159"></A><BR><BR>Lycurgus was much missed at Sparta, and often sent for, "for kings 
<A NAME="160"></A>indeed we have," they said, "who wear the marks and assume the titles of 
<A NAME="161"></A>royalty, but as for the qualities of their minds, they have nothing by 
<A NAME="162"></A>which they are to be distinguished from their subjects; adding, that in 
<A NAME="163"></A>him alone was the true foundation of sovereignty to be seen, a nature made 
<A NAME="164"></A>to rule, and a genius to gain obedience. Nor were the kings themselves 
<A NAME="165"></A>averse to see him back, for they looked upon his presence as a bulwark 
<A NAME="166"></A>against the insolence of the people.
<A NAME="167"></A><BR><BR>Things being in this posture at his return, he applied himself, 
<A NAME="168"></A>without loss of time, to a thorough reformation, and resolved to change 
<A NAME="169"></A>the whole face of the commonwealth; for what could a few particular laws 
<A NAME="170"></A>and a partial alteration avail? He must act as wise physicians do, in the 
<A NAME="171"></A>case of one who labours under a complication of diseases, by force of medicines 
<A NAME="172"></A>reduce and exhaust him, change his whole temperament, and then set him 
<A NAME="173"></A>upon a totally new regimen of diet. Having thus projected things, away 
<A NAME="174"></A>he goes to Delphi to consult Apollo there; which having done, and offered 
<A NAME="175"></A>his sacrifice, he returned with that renowned oracle, in which he is called 
<A NAME="176"></A>beloved of God, and rather God than man; that his prayers were heard, that 
<A NAME="177"></A>his laws should be the best, and the commonwealth which observed them the 
<A NAME="178"></A>most famous in the world. Encouraged by these things he set himself to 
<A NAME="179"></A>bring over to his side the leading men of Sparta, exhorting them to give 
<A NAME="180"></A>him a helping hand in his great undertaking; he broke it first to his particular 
<A NAME="181"></A>friends, and then by degrees, gained others, and animated them all to put 
<A NAME="182"></A>his design in execution. When things were ripe for action, he gave orders 
<A NAME="183"></A>to thirty of the principal men of Sparta to be ready armed at the market-place 
<A NAME="184"></A>by break of day, to the end that he might strike a terror into the opposite 
<A NAME="185"></A>party. Hermippus hath set down the names of twenty of the most eminent 
<A NAME="186"></A>of them; but the name of him whom Lycurgus most confided in, and who was 
<A NAME="187"></A>of most use to him, both in making his laws and putting them in execution 
<A NAME="188"></A>was Arthmiadas. Things growing to a tumult, King Charilaus, apprehending 
<A NAME="189"></A>that it was a conspiracy against his person, took sanctuary in the temple 
<A NAME="190"></A>of Minerva of the Brazen House; but, being soon after undeceived, and having 
<A NAME="191"></A>taken an oath of them that they had no designs against him, he quitted 
<A NAME="192"></A>his refuge, and himself also entered into the confederacy with them; of 
<A NAME="193"></A>so gentle and flexible a disposition he was, to which Archelaus, his brother-king, 
<A NAME="194"></A>alluded, when, hearing him extolled for his goodness, he said, "Who can 
<A NAME="195"></A>say he is anything but good? he is so even to the bad."
<A NAME="196"></A><BR><BR>Amongst the many changes and alterations which Lycurgus made, the 
<A NAME="197"></A>first and of greatest importance was the establishment of the senate, which 
<A NAME="198"></A>having a power equal to the king's in matters of great consequence, and, 
<A NAME="199"></A>as Plato expresses it, allaying and qualifying the fiery genius of the 
<A NAME="200"></A>royal office, gave steadiness and safety to the commonwealth. For the state, 
<A NAME="201"></A>which before had no firm basis to stand upon, but leaned one while towards 
<A NAME="202"></A>an absolute monarchy, when the kings had the upper hand, and another while 
<A NAME="203"></A>towards a pure democracy, when the people had the better, found in this 
<A NAME="204"></A>establishment of the senate a central weight, like ballast in a ship, which 
<A NAME="205"></A>always kept things in a just equilibrium; the twenty-eight always adhering 
<A NAME="206"></A>to the kings so far as to resist democracy, and on the other hand, supporting 
<A NAME="207"></A>the people against the establishment of absolute monarchy. As for the determinate 
<A NAME="208"></A>number of twenty-eight, Aristotle states, that it so fell out because two 
<A NAME="209"></A>of the original associates, for want of courage, fell off from the enterprise; 
<A NAME="210"></A>but Sphaerus assures us that there were but twenty-eight of the confederates 
<A NAME="211"></A>at first; perhaps there is some mystery in the number, which consists of 
<A NAME="212"></A>seven multiplied by four, and is the first of perfect numbers after six, 
<A NAME="213"></A>being, as that is, equal to all its parts. For my part, I believe Lycurgus 
<A NAME="214"></A>fixed upon the number of twenty-eight, that, the two kings being reckoned 
<A NAME="215"></A>amongst them, they might be thirty in all. So eagerly set was he upon this 
<A NAME="216"></A>establishment, that he took the trouble to obtain an oracle about it from 
<A NAME="217"></A>Delphi, the Rhetra, which runs thus: "After that you have built a temple 
<A NAME="218"></A>to Jupiter Helianius, and to Minerva Hellania, and after that you have 
<A NAME="219"></A>phyle'd the people into phyles, and obe'd them into obes, you shall establish 
<A NAME="220"></A>a council of thirty elders, the leaders included, and shall, from time 
<A NAME="221"></A>to time, apellazein the people betwixt Babyca and Cnacion, there propound 
<A NAME="222"></A>and put to the vote. The commons have the final voice and decision." By 
<A NAME="223"></A>phyles and obes are meant the divisions of the people; by the leaders, 
<A NAME="224"></A>the two kings; apellazein, referring to the Pythian Apollo, signifies to 
<A NAME="225"></A>assemble; Babyca and Cnacion they now call Oenus; Aristotle says Cnacion 
<A NAME="226"></A>is a river, and Babyca a bridge. Betwixt this Babyca and Cnacion, their 
<A NAME="227"></A>assemblies were held, for they had no council-house or building to meet 
<A NAME="228"></A>in. Lycurgus was of opinion that ornaments were so far from advantaging 
<A NAME="229"></A>them in their counsels, that they were rather an hindrance, by diverting 
<A NAME="230"></A>their attention from the business before them to statues and pictures, 
<A NAME="231"></A>and roofs curiously fretted, the usual embellishments of such places amongst 
<A NAME="232"></A>the other Greeks. The people then being thus assembled in the open air, 
<A NAME="233"></A>it was not allowed to any one of their order to give his advice, but only 
<A NAME="234"></A>either to ratify or reject what should be propounded to them by the king 
<A NAME="235"></A>or senate. But because it fell out afterwards that the people, by adding 
<A NAME="236"></A>or omitting words, distorted and perverted the sense of propositions, Kings 
<A NAME="237"></A>Polydorus and Theopompus inserted into the Rhetra, or grand covenant, the 
<A NAME="238"></A>following clause: "That if the people decide crookedly it should be lawful 
<A NAME="239"></A>for the elders and leaders to dissolve;" that is to say, refuse ratification, 
<A NAME="240"></A>and dismiss the people as depravers and perverters of their counsel. It 
<A NAME="241"></A>passed among the people, by their management, as being equally authentic 
<A NAME="242"></A>with the rest of the Rhetra, as appears by these verses of 
<A NAME="243"></A>Tyrtaeus,-
<A NAME="244"></A><BR><BR>"These oracles they from Apollo heard,
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>And brought from Pytho home the perfect word:
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>The heaven-appointed kings, who love the land,
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>Shall foremost in the nation's council stand;
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>The elders next to them; the commons last;
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>Let a straight Rhetra among all be passed."
<A NAME="250"></A><BR><BR>Although Lycurgus had, in this manner, used all the qualifications 
<A NAME="251"></A>possible in the constitution of his commonwealth, yet those who succeeded 
<A NAME="252"></A>him found the oligarchical element still too strong and dominant, and to 
<A NAME="253"></A>check its high temper and its violence, put, as Plato says, a bit in its 
<A NAME="254"></A>mouth, which was the power of the ephori, established an hundred and thirty 
<A NAME="255"></A>years after the death of Lycurgus. Elatus and his colleagues were the first 
<A NAME="256"></A>who had this dignity conferred upon them in the reign of King Theopompus, 
<A NAME="257"></A>who, when his queen upbraided him one day that he would leave the regal 
<A NAME="258"></A>power to his children less than he had received it from his ancestors, 
<A NAME="259"></A>said in answer, "No, greater; for it will last longer." For, indeed, their 
<A NAME="260"></A>prerogative being thus reduced within reasonable bounds, the Spartan kings 
<A NAME="261"></A>were at once freed from all further jealousies and consequent danger, and 
<A NAME="262"></A>never experienced the calamities of their neighbours at Messene and Argos, 
<A NAME="263"></A>who, by maintaining their prerogative too strictly for want of yielding 
<A NAME="264"></A>a little to the populace, lost it all.
<A NAME="265"></A><BR><BR>Indeed, whosoever shall look at the sedition and misgovernment 
<A NAME="266"></A>which befell these bordering nations to whom they were as near related 
<A NAME="267"></A>in blood as situation, will find in them the best reason to admire the 
<A NAME="268"></A>wisdom and foresight of Lycurgus. For these three states, in their first 
<A NAME="269"></A>rise, were equal, or, if there were any odds, they lay on the side of the 
<A NAME="270"></A>Messenians and Argives, who, in the first allotment, were thought to have 
<A NAME="271"></A>been luckier than the Spartans; yet was their happiness of but small continuance, 
<A NAME="272"></A>partly the tyrannical temper of their kings and partly the ungovernableness 
<A NAME="273"></A>of the people quickly bringing upon them such disorders, and so complete 
<A NAME="274"></A>an overthrow of all existing institutions, as clearly to show how truly 
<A NAME="275"></A>divine a blessing the Spartans had had in that wise lawgiver who gave their 
<A NAME="276"></A>government its happy balance and temper. But of this I shall say more in 
<A NAME="277"></A>its due place.
<A NAME="278"></A><BR><BR>After the creation of the thirty senators, his next task, and, 
<A NAME="279"></A>indeed, the most hazardous he ever undertook, was the making a new division 
<A NAME="280"></A>of their lands. For there was an extreme inequality amongst them, and their 
<A NAME="281"></A>state was overloaded with a multitude of indigent and necessitous persons, 
<A NAME="282"></A>while its whole wealth had centred upon a very few. To the end, therefore, 
<A NAME="283"></A>that he might expel from the state arrogance and envy, luxury and crime, 
<A NAME="284"></A>and those yet more inveterate diseases of want and superfluity, he obtained 
<A NAME="285"></A>of them to renounce their properties, and to consent to a new division 
<A NAME="286"></A>of the land, and that they should live all together on an equal footing; 
<A NAME="287"></A>merit to be their only road to eminence, and the disgrace of evil, and 
<A NAME="288"></A>credit of worthy acts, their one measure of difference between man and 
<A NAME="289"></A>man.
<A NAME="290"></A><BR><BR>Upon their consent to these proposals, proceeding at once to put 
<A NAME="291"></A>them into execution, he divided the country of Laconia in general into 
<A NAME="292"></A>thirty thousand equal shares, and the part attached to the city of Sparta 
<A NAME="293"></A>into nine thousand; these he distributed among the Spartans, as he did 
<A NAME="294"></A>the others to the country citizens. Some authors say that he made but six 
<A NAME="295"></A>thousand lots for the citizens of Sparta, and that King Polydorus added 
<A NAME="296"></A>three thousand more. Others say that Polydorus doubled the number Lycurgus 
<A NAME="297"></A>had made, which, according to them, was but four thousand five hundred. 
<A NAME="298"></A>A lot was so much as to yield, one year with another, about seventy bushels 
<A NAME="299"></A>of grain for the master of the family, and twelve for his wife, with a 
<A NAME="300"></A>suitable proportion of oil and wine. And this he thought sufficient to 
<A NAME="301"></A>keep their bodies in good health and strength; superfluities they were 
<A NAME="302"></A>better without. It is reported, that, as he returned from a journey shortly 
<A NAME="303"></A>after the division of the lands, in harvest time, the ground being newly 
<A NAME="304"></A>reaped, seeing the stacks all standing equal and alike, he smiled, and 
<A NAME="305"></A>said to those about him, "Methinks all Laconia looks like one family estate 
<A NAME="306"></A>just divided among a number of brothers."
<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR>Not contented with this, he resolved to make a division of their 
<A NAME="308"></A>movables too, that there might be no odious distinction or inequality left 
<A NAME="309"></A>amongst them; but finding that it would be very dangerous to go about it 
<A NAME="310"></A>openly, he took another course, and defeated their avarice by the following 
<A NAME="311"></A>stratagem: he commanded that all gold and silver coin should be called 
<A NAME="312"></A>in, and that only a sort of money made of iron should be current, a great 
<A NAME="313"></A>weight and quantity of which was very little worth; so that to lay up twenty 
<A NAME="314"></A>or thirty pounds there was required a pretty large closet, and, to remove 
<A NAME="315"></A>it, nothing less than a yoke of oxen. With the diffusion of this money, 
<A NAME="316"></A>at once a number of vices were banished from Lacedaemon; for who would 
<A NAME="317"></A>rob another of such a coin? Who would unjustly detain or take by force, 
<A NAME="318"></A>or accept as a bribe, a thing which it was not easy to hide, nor a credit 
<A NAME="319"></A>to have, nor indeed of any use to cut in pieces? For when it was just red 
<A NAME="320"></A>hot, they quenched it in vinegar, and by that means spoilt it, and made 
<A NAME="321"></A>it almost incapable of being worked.
<A NAME="322"></A><BR><BR>In the next place, he declared an outlawry of all needless and 
<A NAME="323"></A>superfluous arts; but here he might almost have spared his proclamation; 
<A NAME="324"></A>for they of themselves would have gone after the gold and silver, the money 
<A NAME="325"></A>which remained being not so proper payment for curious work; for, being 
<A NAME="326"></A>of iron, it was scarcely portable, neither, if they should take the means 
<A NAME="327"></A>to export it, would it pass amongst the other Greeks, who ridiculed it. 
<A NAME="328"></A>So there was now no more means of purchasing foreign goods and small wares; 
<A NAME="329"></A>merchants sent no shiploads into Laconian ports; no rhetoric-master, no 
<A NAME="330"></A>itinerate fortune-teller, no harlot-monger, or gold or silversmith, engraver, 
<A NAME="331"></A>or jeweller, set foot in a country which had no money; so that luxury, 
<A NAME="332"></A>deprived little by little of that which fed and fomented it, wasted to 
<A NAME="333"></A>nothing and died away of itself. For the rich had no advantage here over 
<A NAME="334"></A>the poor, as their wealth and abundance had no road to come abroad by but 
<A NAME="335"></A>were shut up at home doing nothing. And in this way they became excellent 
<A NAME="336"></A>artists in common, necessary things; bedsteads, chairs, and tables, and 
<A NAME="337"></A>such like staple utensils in a family, were admirably well made there; 
<A NAME="338"></A>their cup, particularly, was very much in fashion, and eagerly bought up 
<A NAME="339"></A>by soldiers, as Critias reports; for its colour was such as to prevent 
<A NAME="340"></A>water, drunk upon necessity and disagreeable to look at, from being noticed; 
<A NAME="341"></A>and the shape of it was such that the mud stuck to the sides, so that only 
<A NAME="342"></A>the purer part came to the drinker's mouth. For this also, they had to 
<A NAME="343"></A>thank their lawgiver, who, by relieving the artisans of the trouble of 
<A NAME="344"></A>making useless things, set them to show their skill in giving, beauty to 
<A NAME="345"></A>those of daily and indispensable use.
<A NAME="346"></A><BR><BR>The third and most masterly stroke of this great lawgiver, by which 
<A NAME="347"></A>he struck a yet more effectual blow against luxury and the desire of riches, 
<A NAME="348"></A>was the ordinance he made, that they should all eat in common, of the same 
<A NAME="349"></A>bread and same meat, and of kinds that were specified, and should not spend 
<A NAME="350"></A>their lives at home, laid on costly couches at splendid tables, delivering 
<A NAME="351"></A>themselves up into the hands of their tradesmen and cooks, to fatten them 
<A NAME="352"></A>in corners, like greedy brutes, and to ruin not their minds only but their 
<A NAME="353"></A>very bodies which, enfeebled by indulgence and excess, would stand in need 
<A NAME="354"></A>of long sleep, warm bathing, freedom from work, and, in a word, of as much 
<A NAME="355"></A>care and attendance as if they were continually sick. It was certainly 
<A NAME="356"></A>an extraordinary thing to have brought about such a result as this, but 
<A NAME="357"></A>a greater yet to have taken away from wealth, as Theophrastus observes, 
<A NAME="358"></A>not merely the property of being coveted, but its very nature of being 
<A NAME="359"></A>wealth. For the rich, being obliged to go to the same table with the poor, 
<A NAME="360"></A>could not make use of or enjoy their abundance, nor so much as please their 
<A NAME="361"></A>vanity by looking at or displaying it. So that the common proverb, that 
<A NAME="362"></A>Plutus, the god of riches, is blind, was nowhere in all the world literally 
<A NAME="363"></A>verified but in Sparta. There, indeed, he was not only blind, but like 
<A NAME="364"></A>a picture, without either life or motion. Nor were they allowed to take 
<A NAME="365"></A>food at home first, and then attend the public tables, for every one had 
<A NAME="366"></A>an eye upon those who did not eat and drink like the rest, and reproached 
<A NAME="367"></A>them with being dainty and effeminate.
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR>This last ordinance in particular exasperated the wealthier men. 
<A NAME="369"></A>They collected in a body against Lycurgus, and from ill words came to throwing 
<A NAME="370"></A>stones, so that at length he was forced to run out of the market-place, 
<A NAME="371"></A>and make to sanctuary to save his life; by good-hap he outran all, excepting 
<A NAME="372"></A>one Alcander, a young man otherwise not ill accomplished, but hasty and 
<A NAME="373"></A>violent, who came up so close to him, that when he turned to see who was 
<A NAME="374"></A>so near him, he struck him upon the face with his stick, and put out one 
<A NAME="375"></A>of his eyes. Lycurgus, so far from being daunted and discouraged by this 
<A NAME="376"></A>accident, stopped short and showed his disfigured face and eye beat out 
<A NAME="377"></A>to his countrymen; they, dismayed and ashamed at the sight, delivered Alcander 
<A NAME="378"></A>into his hands to be punished, and escorted him home, with expressions 
<A NAME="379"></A>of great concern for his ill-usage. Lycurgus, having thanked them for their 
<A NAME="380"></A>care of his person, dismissed them all, excepting only Alcander; and, taking 
<A NAME="381"></A>him with him into his house, neither did nor said anything severely to 
<A NAME="382"></A>him, but, dismissing those whose place it was, bade Alcander to wait upon 
<A NAME="383"></A>him at table. The young man, who was of an ingenuous temper, without murmuring 
<A NAME="384"></A>did as he was commanded; and being thus admitted to live with Lycurgus, 
<A NAME="385"></A>he had an opportunity to observe in him, besides his gentleness and calmness 
<A NAME="386"></A>of temper, an extraordinary sobriety and an indefatigable industry, and 
<A NAME="387"></A>so, from an enemy, became one of his most zealous admirers, and told his 
<A NAME="388"></A>friends and relations that Lycurgus was not that morose and ill-natured 
<A NAME="389"></A>man they had formerly taken him for, but the one mild and gentle character 
<A NAME="390"></A>of the world. And thus did Lycurgus, for chastisement of his fault, make 
<A NAME="391"></A>of a wild and passionate young man one of the discreetest citizens of 
<A NAME="392"></A>Sparta.
<A NAME="393"></A><BR><BR>In memory of this accident, Lycurgus built a temple to Minerva, 
<A NAME="394"></A>surnamed Optiletis; optilus being the Doric of these parts for ophthalmus, 
<A NAME="395"></A>the eye. Some authors, however, of whom Dioscorides is one (who wrote a 
<A NAME="396"></A>treatise on the commonwealth of Sparta), say that he was wounded, indeed, 
<A NAME="397"></A>but did not lose his eye with the blow; but that he built the temple in 
<A NAME="398"></A>gratitude for the cure. Be this as it will, certain it is, that, after 
<A NAME="399"></A>this misadventure, the Lacedaemonians made it a rule never to carry so 
<A NAME="400"></A>much as a staff into their public assemblies.
<A NAME="401"></A><BR><BR>But to return to their public repast;- these had several names 
<A NAME="402"></A>in Greek; the Cretans called them andria, because the men only came to 
<A NAME="403"></A>them. The Lacedaemonians called them phiditia, that is, by changing l into 
<A NAME="404"></A>d, the same as philitia, love feasts, because that, by eating and drinking 
<A NAME="405"></A>together, they had opportunity of making friends. Or perhaps from phido, 
<A NAME="406"></A>parsimony, because they were so many schools of sobriety; or perhaps the 
<A NAME="407"></A>first letter is an addition, and the word at first was editia, from edode, 
<A NAME="408"></A>eating. They met by companies of fifteen, more or less, and each of them 
<A NAME="409"></A>stood bound to bring in monthly a bushel of meal, eight gallons of wine, 
<A NAME="410"></A>five pounds of cheese, two pounds and a half of figs, and a very  small 
<A NAME="411"></A>sum of money to buy flesh or fish with. Besides this, when any of them 
<A NAME="412"></A>made sacrifice to the gods, they always sent a dole to the common hall; 
<A NAME="413"></A>and, likewise, when any of them had been a hunting, he sent thither a part 
<A NAME="414"></A>of the venison he had killed; for these two occasions were the only excuses 
<A NAME="415"></A>allowed for supping at home. The custom of eating together was observed 
<A NAME="416"></A>strictly for a great while afterwards; insomuch that King Agis himself, 
<A NAME="417"></A>after having vanquished the Athenians, sending for his commons at his return 
<A NAME="418"></A>home, because he desired to eat privately with his queen, was refused them 
<A NAME="419"></A>by the polemarchs; which refusal when he resented so much as to omit next 
<A NAME="420"></A>day the sacrifice due for a war happily ended, they made him pay a 
<A NAME="421"></A>fine.
<A NAME="422"></A><BR><BR>They used to send their children to these tables as to schools 
<A NAME="423"></A>of temperance; here they were instructed in state affairs by listening 
<A NAME="424"></A>to experienced statesmen; here they learned to converse with pleasantry, 
<A NAME="425"></A>to make jests without scurrility and take them without ill humour. In this 
<A NAME="426"></A>point of good breeding, the Lacedaemonians excelled particularly, but if 
<A NAME="427"></A>any man were uneasy under it, upon the least hint given, there was no more 
<A NAME="428"></A>to be said to him. It was customary also for the eldest man in the company 
<A NAME="429"></A>to say to each of them, as they came in, "Through this" (pointing to the 
<A NAME="430"></A>door), "no words go out." When any one had a desire to be admitted into 
<A NAME="431"></A>any of these little societies, he was to go through the following probation: 
<A NAME="432"></A>each man in the company took a little ball of soft bread, which they were 
<A NAME="433"></A>to throw into a deep basin, which a waiter carried round upon his head; 
<A NAME="434"></A>those that liked the person to be chosen dropped their ball into the basin 
<A NAME="435"></A>without altering its figure, and those who disliked him pressed it betwixt 
<A NAME="436"></A>their fingers, and made it flat; and this signified as much as a negative 
<A NAME="437"></A>voice. And if there were but one of these flattened pieces in the basin, 
<A NAME="438"></A>the suitor was rejected, so desirous were they that all the members of 
<A NAME="439"></A>the company should be agreeable to each other. The basin was called caddichus, 
<A NAME="440"></A>and the rejected candidate had a name thence derived. Their most famous 
<A NAME="441"></A>dish was the black broth, which was so much valued that the elderly men 
<A NAME="442"></A>fed only upon that, leaving what flesh there was to the 
<A NAME="443"></A>younger.
<A NAME="444"></A><BR><BR>They say that a certain king of Pontus, having heard much of this 
<A NAME="445"></A>black broth of theirs, sent for a Lacedaemonian cook on purpose to make 
<A NAME="446"></A>him some, but had no sooner tasted it than he found it extremely bad, which 
<A NAME="447"></A>the cook observing, told him, "Sir, to make this broth relish, you should 
<A NAME="448"></A>have bathed yourself first in the river Eurotas."
<A NAME="449"></A><BR><BR>After drinking moderately, every man went to his home without lights, 
<A NAME="450"></A>for the use of them was, on all occasions, forbid to the end that they 
<A NAME="451"></A>might accustom themselves to march boldly in the dark. Such was the common 
<A NAME="452"></A>fashion of their meals.
<A NAME="453"></A><BR><BR>Lycurgus would never reduce his laws into writing; nay there is 
<A NAME="454"></A>a Rhetra expressly to forbid it. For he thought that the most material 
<A NAME="455"></A>points, and such as most directly tended to the public welfare, being imprinted 
<A NAME="456"></A>on the hearts of their youth by a good discipline, would be sure to remain, 
<A NAME="457"></A>and would find a stronger security, than any compulsion would be in the 
<A NAME="458"></A>principles of action formed in them by their best lawgiver, education. 
<A NAME="459"></A>And as for things of lesser importance, as pecuniary contracts, and such 
<A NAME="460"></A>like, the forms of which have to be changed as occasion requires, he thought 
<A NAME="461"></A>it the best way to prescribe no positive rule or inviolable usage in such 
<A NAME="462"></A>cases, willing that their manner and form should be altered according to 
<A NAME="463"></A>the circumstances of time, and determinations of men of sound judgment. 
<A NAME="464"></A>Every end and object of law and enactment it was his design education should 
<A NAME="465"></A>effect.
<A NAME="466"></A><BR><BR>One, then, of the Rhetras was, that their laws should not be written; 
<A NAME="467"></A>another is particularly levelled against luxury and expensiveness, for 
<A NAME="468"></A>by it was ordained that the ceilings of their houses should only be wrought 
<A NAME="469"></A>by the axe, and their gates and doors smoothed only by the saw. Epaminondas's 
<A NAME="470"></A>famous dictum about his own table, that "Treason and a dinner like this 
<A NAME="471"></A>do not keep company together," may be said to have been anticipated by 
<A NAME="472"></A>Lycurgus. Luxury and a house of this kind could not well be companions. 
<A NAME="473"></A>For a man might have a less than ordinary share of sense that would furnish 
<A NAME="474"></A>such plain and common rooms with silver-footed couches and purple coverlets 
<A NAME="475"></A>and gold and silver plate. Doubtless he had good reason to think that they 
<A NAME="476"></A>would proportion their beds to their houses, and their coverlets to their 
<A NAME="477"></A>houses, and their coverlets to their beds, and the rest of their goods 
<A NAME="478"></A>and furniture to these. It is reported that king Leotychides, the first 
<A NAME="479"></A>of that name, was so little used to the sight of any other kind of work, 
<A NAME="480"></A>that, being entertained at Corinth in a stately room, he was much surprised 
<A NAME="481"></A>to see the timber and ceiling so finely carved and panelled, and asked 
<A NAME="482"></A>his host whether the trees grew so in his country.
<A NAME="483"></A><BR><BR>A third ordinance of Rhetra was, that they should not make war 
<A NAME="484"></A>often, or long, with the same enemy, lest that they should train and instruct 
<A NAME="485"></A>them in war, by habituating them to defend themselves. And this is what 
<A NAME="486"></A>Agesilaus was much blamed for, a long time after; it being thought, that, 
<A NAME="487"></A>by his continual incursions into Boeotia, he made the Thebans a match for 
<A NAME="488"></A>the Lacedaemonians; and therefore Antalcidas, seeing him wounded one day, 
<A NAME="489"></A>said to him, that he was very well paid for taking such pains to make the 
<A NAME="490"></A>Thebans good soldiers, whether they would or no. These laws were called 
<A NAME="491"></A>the Rhetras, to intimate that they were divine sanctions and 
<A NAME="492"></A>revelations.
<A NAME="493"></A><BR><BR>In order to the good education of their youth (which, as I said 
<A NAME="494"></A>before, he thought the most important and noblest work of a lawgiver), 
<A NAME="495"></A>he went so far back as to take into consideration their very conception 
<A NAME="496"></A>and birth, by regulating their marriages. For Aristotle is wrong in saying, 
<A NAME="497"></A>that, after he had tried all ways to reduce the women to more modesty and 
<A NAME="498"></A>sobriety, he was at last forced to leave them as they were, because that 
<A NAME="499"></A>in the absence of their husbands, who spent the best part of their lives 
<A NAME="500"></A>in the wars, their wives, whom they were obliged to leave absolute mistresses 
<A NAME="501"></A>at home, took great liberties and assumed the superiority; and were treated 
<A NAME="502"></A>with overmuch respect and called by the title of lady or queen. The truth 
<A NAME="503"></A>is, he took in their case, also, all the care that was possible; he ordered 
<A NAME="504"></A>the maidens to exercise themselves with wrestling, running, throwing, the 
<A NAME="505"></A>quoit, and casting the dart, to the end that the fruit they conceived might, 
<A NAME="506"></A>in strong and healthy bodies, take firmer root and find better growth, 
<A NAME="507"></A>and withal that they, with this greater vigour, might be the more able 
<A NAME="508"></A>to undergo the pains of child-bearing. And to the end he might take away 
<A NAME="509"></A>their overgreat tenderness and fear of exposure to the air, and all acquired 
<A NAME="510"></A>womanishness, he ordered that the young women should go naked in the processions, 
<A NAME="511"></A>as well as the young men, and dance, too, in that condition, at certain 
<A NAME="512"></A>solemn feasts, singing certain songs, whilst the young men stood around, 
<A NAME="513"></A>seeing and hearing them. On these occasions they now and then made, by 
<A NAME="514"></A>jests, a befitting reflection upon those who had misbehaved themselves 
<A NAME="515"></A>in the wars; and again sang encomiums upon those who had done any gallant 
<A NAME="516"></A>action, and by these means inspired the younger sort with an emulation 
<A NAME="517"></A>of their glory. Those that were thus commended went away proud, elated, 
<A NAME="518"></A>and gratified with their honour among the maidens; and those who were rallied 
<A NAME="519"></A>were as sensibly touched with it as if they had been formally reprimanded; 
<A NAME="520"></A>and so much the more, because the kings and the elders, as well as the 
<A NAME="521"></A>rest of the city, saw and heard all that passed. Nor was there anything 
<A NAME="522"></A>shameful in this nakedness of the young women; modesty attended them, and 
<A NAME="523"></A>all wantonness was excluded. It taught them simplicity and a care for good 
<A NAME="524"></A>health, and gave them some taste of higher feelings, admitted as they thus 
<A NAME="525"></A>were to the field of noble action and glory. Hence it was natural for them 
<A NAME="526"></A>to think and speak as Gorgo, for example, the wife of Leonidas, is said 
<A NAME="527"></A>to have done, when some foreign lady, as it would seem, told her that the 
<A NAME="528"></A>women of Lacedaemon were the only women in the world who could rule men; 
<A NAME="529"></A>"With good reason," she said, "for we are the only women who bring forth 
<A NAME="530"></A>men."
<A NAME="531"></A><BR><BR>These public processions of the maidens, and their appearing naked 
<A NAME="532"></A>in their exercises and dancings, were incitements to marriage, operating 
<A NAME="533"></A>upon the young with the rigour and certainty, as Plato says, of love, if 
<A NAME="534"></A>not of mathematics. But besides all this, to promote it yet more effectually, 
<A NAME="535"></A>those who continued bachelors were in a degree disfranchised by law; for 
<A NAME="536"></A>they were excluded from the sight those public processions in which the 
<A NAME="537"></A>young men and maidens danced naked, and, in winter-time, the officers compelled 
<A NAME="538"></A>them to march naked themselves round the marketplace, singing as they went 
<A NAME="539"></A>a certain song to their own disgrace, that they justly suffered this punishment 
<A NAME="540"></A>for disobeying the laws. Moreover, they were denied that respect and observance 
<A NAME="541"></A>which the younger men paid their elders; and no man, for example, found 
<A NAME="542"></A>fault with what was said to Dercyllidas, though so eminent a commander; 
<A NAME="543"></A>upon whose approach one day, a young man, instead of rising, retained his 
<A NAME="544"></A>seat, remarking, "No child of yours will make room for 
<A NAME="545"></A>me."
<A NAME="546"></A><BR><BR>In their marriages, the husband carried off his bride by a sort 
<A NAME="547"></A>of force; nor were their brides ever small and of tender years, but in 
<A NAME="548"></A>their full bloom and ripeness. After this, she who superintended the wedding 
<A NAME="549"></A>comes and clips the hair of the bride close round her head, dresses her 
<A NAME="550"></A>up in man's clothes, and leaves her upon a mattress in the dark; afterwards 
<A NAME="551"></A>comes the bridegroom, in his everyday clothes, sober and composed, as having 
<A NAME="552"></A>supped at the common table, and, entering privately into the room where 
<A NAME="553"></A>the bride lies, unties her virgin zone, and takes her to himself; and, 
<A NAME="554"></A>after staying some time together, he returns composedly to his own apartment, 
<A NAME="555"></A>to sleep as usual with the other young men. And so he continues to do, 
<A NAME="556"></A>spending his days, and, indeed, his nights, with them, visiting his bride 
<A NAME="557"></A>in fear and shame, and with circumspection, when he thought he should not 
<A NAME="558"></A>be observed she, also, on her part, using her wit to help and find favourable 
<A NAME="559"></A>opportunities for their meeting, when company was out of the way. In this 
<A NAME="560"></A>manner they lived a long time, insomuch that they sometimes had children 
<A NAME="561"></A>by their wives before ever they saw their faces by daylight. Their interviews, 
<A NAME="562"></A>being thus difficult and rare, served not only for continual exercise of 
<A NAME="563"></A>their self-control, but brought them together with their bodies healthy 
<A NAME="564"></A>and vigorous, and their affections fresh and lively, unsated and undulled 
<A NAME="565"></A>by easy access and long continuance with each other; while their partings 
<A NAME="566"></A>were always early enough to leave behind unextinguished in each of them 
<A NAME="567"></A>some remaining fire of longing and mutual delight. After guarding marriage 
<A NAME="568"></A>with this modesty and reserve, he was equally careful to banish empty and 
<A NAME="569"></A>womanish jealousy. For this object, excluding all licentious disorders, 
<A NAME="570"></A>he made it, nevertheless, honourable for men to give the use of their wives 
<A NAME="571"></A>to those whom they should think fit, that so they might have children by 
<A NAME="572"></A>them; ridiculing those in whose opinion such favours are so unfit for participation 
<A NAME="573"></A>as to fight and shed blood and go to war about it. Lycurgus allowed a man 
<A NAME="574"></A>who was advanced in years and had a young wife to recommend some virtuous 
<A NAME="575"></A>and approved young man, that she might have a child by him, who might inherit 
<A NAME="576"></A>the good qualities of the father, and be a son to himself. On the other 
<A NAME="577"></A>side, an honest man who had love for a married woman upon account of her 
<A NAME="578"></A>modesty and the well-favouredness of her children, might, without formality, 
<A NAME="579"></A>beg her company of her husband, that he might raise, as it were, from this 
<A NAME="580"></A>plot of good ground, worthy and well-allied children for himself. And indeed, 
<A NAME="581"></A>Lycurgus was of a persuasion that children were not so much the property 
<A NAME="582"></A>of their parents as of the whole commonwealth, and, therefore, would not 
<A NAME="583"></A>have his citizens begot by the first-comers, but by the best men that could 
<A NAME="584"></A>be found; the laws of other nations seemed to him very absurd and inconsistent, 
<A NAME="585"></A>where people would be so solicitous for their dogs and horses as to exert 
<A NAME="586"></A>interest and to pay money to procure fine breeding, and yet kept their 
<A NAME="587"></A>wives shut up, to be made mothers only by themselves, who might be foolish, 
<A NAME="588"></A>infirm, or diseased; as if it were not apparent that children of a bad 
<A NAME="589"></A>breed would prove their bad qualities first upon those who kept and were 
<A NAME="590"></A>rearing them, and well-born children, in like manner, their good qualities. 
<A NAME="591"></A>These regulations, founded on natural and social grounds, were certainly 
<A NAME="592"></A>so far from that scandalous liberty which was afterwards charged upon their 
<A NAME="593"></A>women, that they knew not what adultery meant. It is told, for instance, 
<A NAME="594"></A>of Geradas, a very ancient Spartan, that, being asked by a stranger what 
<A NAME="595"></A>punishment their law had appointed for adulterers, he answered, "There 
<A NAME="596"></A>are no adulterers in our country." "But," replied the stranger, "suppose 
<A NAME="597"></A>there were?" "Then," answered he, "the offender would have to give the 
<A NAME="598"></A>plaintiff a bull with a neck so long as that he might drink from the top 
<A NAME="599"></A>of Taygetus of the Eurotas river below it." The man, surprised at this, 
<A NAME="600"></A>said, "Why, 'tis impossible to find such a bull." Geradas smilingly replied, 
<A NAME="601"></A>"'Tis as possible as to find an adulterer in Sparta." So much I had to 
<A NAME="602"></A>say of their marriages.
<A NAME="603"></A><BR><BR>Nor was it in the power of the father to dispose of the child as 
<A NAME="604"></A>he thought fit; he was obliged to carry it before certain triers at a place 
<A NAME="605"></A>called Lesche; these were some of the elders of the tribe to which the 
<A NAME="606"></A>child belonged; their business it was carefully to view the infant, and, 
<A NAME="607"></A>if they found it stout and well made, they gave order for its rearing, 
<A NAME="608"></A>and allotted to it one of the nine thousand shares of land above mentioned 
<A NAME="609"></A>for its maintenance, but, if they found it puny and ill-shaped, ordered 
<A NAME="610"></A>it to be taken to what was called the Apothetae, a sort of chasm under 
<A NAME="611"></A>Taygetus; as thinking it neither for the good of the child itself, nor 
<A NAME="612"></A>for the public interest, that it should be brought up, if it did not, from 
<A NAME="613"></A>the very outset, appear made to be healthy and vigorous. Upon the same 
<A NAME="614"></A>account, the women did not bathe the new-born children with water, as is 
<A NAME="615"></A>the custom in all other countries, but with wine, to prove the temper and 
<A NAME="616"></A>complexion of their bodies; from a notion they had that epileptic and weakly 
<A NAME="617"></A>children faint and waste away upon their being thus bathed while, on the 
<A NAME="618"></A>contrary, those of a strong and vigorous habit acquire firmness and get 
<A NAME="619"></A>a temper by it, like steel. There was much care and art, too, used by the 
<A NAME="620"></A>nurses; they had no swaddling bands; the children grew up free and unconstrained 
<A NAME="621"></A>in limb and form, and not dainty and fanciful about their food; not afraid 
<A NAME="622"></A>in the dark, or of being left alone; and without peevishness, or ill-humour, 
<A NAME="623"></A>or crying. Upon this account Spartan nurses were often bought up, or hired 
<A NAME="624"></A>by people of other countries; and it is recorded that she who suckled Alcibiades 
<A NAME="625"></A>was a Spartan; who, however, if fortunate in his nurse, was not so in his 
<A NAME="626"></A>preceptor; his guardian, Pericles, as Plato tells us, chose a servant for 
<A NAME="627"></A>that office called Zopyrus, no better than any common 
<A NAME="628"></A>slave.
<A NAME="629"></A><BR><BR>Lycurgus was of another mind; he would not have masters bought 
<A NAME="630"></A>out of the market for his young Spartans, nor such as should sell their 
<A NAME="631"></A>pains; nor was it lawful, indeed, for the father himself to breed up the 
<A NAME="632"></A>children after his own fancy; but as soon as they were seven years old 
<A NAME="633"></A>they were to be enrolled in certain companies and classes, where they all 
<A NAME="634"></A>lived under the same order and discipline, doing their exercises and taking 
<A NAME="635"></A>their play together. Of these, he who showed the most conduct and courage 
<A NAME="636"></A>was made captain; they had their eyes always upon him, obeyed his orders, 
<A NAME="637"></A>and underwent patiently whatsoever punishment he inflicted; so that the 
<A NAME="638"></A>whole course of their education was one continued exercise of a ready and 
<A NAME="639"></A>perfect obedience. The old men, too, were spectators of their performances, 
<A NAME="640"></A>and often raised quarrels and disputes among them, to have a good opportunity 
<A NAME="641"></A>of finding out their different characters, and of seeing which would be 
<A NAME="642"></A>valiant, which a coward, when they should come to more dangerous encounters. 
<A NAME="643"></A>Reading and writing they gave them, just enough to serve their turn; their 
<A NAME="644"></A>chief care was to make them good subjects, and to teach them to endure 
<A NAME="645"></A>pain and conquer in battle. To this end, as they grew in years, their discipline 
<A NAME="646"></A>was proportionately increased; their heads were close-clipped, they were 
<A NAME="647"></A>accustomed to go barefoot, and for the most part to play 
<A NAME="648"></A>naked.
<A NAME="649"></A><BR><BR>After they were twelve years old, they were no longer allowed to 
<A NAME="650"></A>wear any undergarments, they had one coat to serve them a year; their bodies 
<A NAME="651"></A>were hard and dry, with but little acquaintance of baths and unguents; 
<A NAME="652"></A>these human indulgences they were allowed only on some few particular days 
<A NAME="653"></A>in the year. They lodged together in little bands upon beds made of the 
<A NAME="654"></A>rushes which grew by the banks of the river Eurotas, which they were to 
<A NAME="655"></A>break off with their hands without a knife; if it were winter, they mingled 
<A NAME="656"></A>some thistle-down with their rushes, which it was thought had the property 
<A NAME="657"></A>of giving warmth. By the time they were come to this age there was not 
<A NAME="658"></A>any of the more hopeful boys who had not a lover to bear him company. The 
<A NAME="659"></A>old men, too, had an eye upon them, coming often to the grounds to hear 
<A NAME="660"></A>and see them contend either in wit or strength with one another, and this 
<A NAME="661"></A>as seriously and with as much concern as if they were their fathers, their 
<A NAME="662"></A>tutors, or their magistrates; so that there scarcely was any time or place 
<A NAME="663"></A>without some one present to put them in mind of their duty, and punish 
<A NAME="664"></A>them if they had neglected it.
<A NAME="665"></A><BR><BR>Besides all this, there was always one of the best and honestest 
<A NAME="666"></A>men in the city appointed to undertake the charge and governance of them; 
<A NAME="667"></A>he again arranged them into their several bands, and set over each of them 
<A NAME="668"></A>for their captain the most temperate and boldest of those they called Irens, 
<A NAME="669"></A>who were usually twenty years old, two years out of the boys; and the oldest 
<A NAME="670"></A>of the boys, again, were Mell-Irens, as much as to say, who would shortly 
<A NAME="671"></A>be men. This young man, therefore, was their captain when they fought and 
<A NAME="672"></A>their master at home, using them for the offices of his house; sending 
<A NAME="673"></A>the eldest of them to fetch wood, and the weaker and less able to gather 
<A NAME="674"></A>salads and herbs, and these they must either go without or steal; which 
<A NAME="675"></A>they did by creeping into the gardens, or conveying themselves cunningly 
<A NAME="676"></A>and closely into the eating-houses; if they were taken in the fact, they 
<A NAME="677"></A>were whipped without mercy, for thieving so ill and awkwardly. They stole, 
<A NAME="678"></A>too, all other meat they could lay their hands on, looking out and watching 
<A NAME="679"></A>all opportunities, when people were asleep or more careless than usual. 
<A NAME="680"></A>If they were caught, they were not only punished with whipping, but hunger, 
<A NAME="681"></A>too, being reduced to their ordinary allowance, which was but very slender, 
<A NAME="682"></A>and so contrived on purpose, that they might set about to help themselves, 
<A NAME="683"></A>and be forced to exercise their energy and address. This was the principal 
<A NAME="684"></A>design of their hard fare; there was another not inconsiderable, that they 
<A NAME="685"></A>might grow taller; for the vital spirits, not being overburdened and oppressed 
<A NAME="686"></A>by too great a quantity of nourishment, which necessarily discharges itself 
<A NAME="687"></A>into thickness and breadth, do, by their natural lightness, rise; and the 
<A NAME="688"></A>body, giving and yielding because it is pliant, grows in height. The same 
<A NAME="689"></A>thing seems, also, to conduce to beauty of shape; a dry and lean habit 
<A NAME="690"></A>is a better subject for nature's configuration, which the gross and over-fed 
<A NAME="691"></A>are too heavy to submit to properly. Just as we find that women who take 
<A NAME="692"></A>physic whilst they are with child, bear leaner and smaller but better-shaped 
<A NAME="693"></A>and prettier children; the material they come of having been more pliable 
<A NAME="694"></A>and easily moulded. The reason, however, I leave others to 
<A NAME="695"></A>determine.
<A NAME="696"></A><BR><BR>To return from whence we have digressed. So seriously did the Lacedaemonian 
<A NAME="697"></A>children go about their stealing, that a youth, having stolen a young fox 
<A NAME="698"></A>and hid it under his coat, suffered it to tear out his very bowels with 
<A NAME="699"></A>its teeth and claws and died upon the place, rather than let it be seen. 
<A NAME="700"></A>What is practised to this very day in Lacedaemon is enough to gain credit 
<A NAME="701"></A>to this story, for I myself have seen several of the youths endure whipping 
<A NAME="702"></A>to death at the foot of the altar of Diana surnamed 
<A NAME="703"></A>Orthia.
<A NAME="704"></A><BR><BR>The Iren, or under-master, used to stay a little with them after 
<A NAME="705"></A>supper, and one of them he bade to sing a song, to another he put a question 
<A NAME="706"></A>which required an advised and deliberate answer; for example, Who was the 
<A NAME="707"></A>best man in the city? What he thought of such an action of such a man? 
<A NAME="708"></A>They used them thus early to pass a right judgment upon persons and things, 
<A NAME="709"></A>and to inform themselves of the abilities or defects of their countrymen. 
<A NAME="710"></A>If they had not an answer ready to the question, Who was a good or who 
<A NAME="711"></A>an ill-reputed citizen, they were looked upon as of a dull and careless 
<A NAME="712"></A>disposition, and to have little or no sense of virtue and honour; besides 
<A NAME="713"></A>this, they were to give a good reason for what they said, and in as few 
<A NAME="714"></A>words and as comprehensive as might be; he that failed of this, or answered 
<A NAME="715"></A>not to the purpose, had his thumb bit by the master. Sometimes the Iren 
<A NAME="716"></A>did this in the presence of the old men and magistrates, that they might 
<A NAME="717"></A>see whether he punished them justly and in due measure or not, and when 
<A NAME="718"></A>he did amiss, they would not reprove him before the boys, but, when they 
<A NAME="719"></A>were gone, he was called to an account and underwent correction, if he 
<A NAME="720"></A>had run far into either of the extremes of indulgence or 
<A NAME="721"></A>severity.
<A NAME="722"></A><BR><BR>Their lovers and favourers, too, had a share in the young boy's 
<A NAME="723"></A>honour or disgrace; and there goes a story that one of them was fined by 
<A NAME="724"></A>the magistrate, because the lad whom he loved cried out effeminately as 
<A NAME="725"></A>he was fighting. And though this sort of love was so approved among them, 
<A NAME="726"></A>that the most virtuous matrons would make professions of it to young girls, 
<A NAME="727"></A>yet rivalry did not exist, and if several men's fancies met in one person, 
<A NAME="728"></A>it was rather the beginning of an intimate friendship, whilst they all 
<A NAME="729"></A>jointly conspired to render the object of their effection as accomplished 
<A NAME="730"></A>as possible.
<A NAME="731"></A><BR><BR>They taught them, also, to speak with a natural and graceful raillery, 
<A NAME="732"></A>and to comprehend much matter of thought in few words. For Lycurgus, who 
<A NAME="733"></A>ordered, as we saw, that a great piece of money should be but of an inconsiderable 
<A NAME="734"></A>value, on the contrary would allow no discourse to be current which did 
<A NAME="735"></A>not contain in few words a great deal of useful and curious sense; children 
<A NAME="736"></A>in Sparta, by a habit of long silence, came to give just and sententious 
<A NAME="737"></A>answers; for, indeed, as loose and incontinent livers are seldom fathers 
<A NAME="738"></A>of many children, so loose and incontinent talkers seldom originate many 
<A NAME="739"></A>sensible words. King Agis, when some Athenian laughed at their short swords, 
<A NAME="740"></A>and said that the jugglers on the stage swallowed them with ease, answered 
<A NAME="741"></A>him, "We find them long enough to reach our enemies with;" and as their 
<A NAME="742"></A>swords were short and sharp, so, it seems to me, were their sayings. They 
<A NAME="743"></A>reach the point and arrest the attention of the hearers better than any. 
<A NAME="744"></A>Lycurgus himself seems to have been short and sententious, if we may trust 
<A NAME="745"></A>the anecdotes of him; as appears by his answer to one who by all means 
<A NAME="746"></A>would set up a democracy in Lacedaemon. "Begin, friend," said he, "and 
<A NAME="747"></A>set it up in your family." Another asked him why he allowed of such mean 
<A NAME="748"></A>and trivial sacrifices to the gods. He replied, "That we may always have 
<A NAME="749"></A>something to offer to them." Being asked what sort of martial exercises 
<A NAME="750"></A>or combats he approved of, he answered, "All sorts, except that in which 
<A NAME="751"></A>you stretch out your hands." Similar answers, addressed to his countrymen 
<A NAME="752"></A>by letter, are ascribed to him; as, being consulted how they might best 
<A NAME="753"></A>oppose an invasion of their enemies, he returned this answer, "By continuing 
<A NAME="754"></A>poor, and not coveting each man to be greater than his fellow." Being consulted 
<A NAME="755"></A>again whether it were requisite to enclose the city with a wall, he sent 
<A NAME="756"></A>them word, "The city is well fortified which hath a wall of men instead 
<A NAME="757"></A>of brick." But whether these letters are counterfeit or not is not easy 
<A NAME="758"></A>to determine.
<A NAME="759"></A><BR><BR>Of their dislike to talkativeness, the following apophthegms are 
<A NAME="760"></A>evidence. King Leonidas said to one who held him in discourse upon some 
<A NAME="761"></A>useful matter, but not in due time and place, "Much to the purpose, Sir, 
<A NAME="762"></A>elsewhere." King Charilaus, the nephew of Lycurgus, being asked why his 
<A NAME="763"></A>uncle had made so few laws, answered, "Men of few words require but few 
<A NAME="764"></A>laws." When one, named Hecataeus the sophist, because that, being invited 
<A NAME="765"></A>to the public table, he had not spoken one word all supper-time, Archidamidas 
<A NAME="766"></A>answered in his vindication, "He who knows how to speak, knows also 
<A NAME="767"></A>when."
<A NAME="768"></A><BR><BR>The sharp and yet not ungraceful retorts which I mentioned may 
<A NAME="769"></A>be instanced as follows. Demaratus, being asked in a troublesome manner 
<A NAME="770"></A>by an importunate fellow, Who was the best man in Lacedaemon? answered 
<A NAME="771"></A>at last, "He, Sir, that is the least like you." Some, in company where 
<A NAME="772"></A>Agis was, much extolled the Eleans for their just and honourable management 
<A NAME="773"></A>of the Olympic games; "Indeed," said Agis, "they are highly to be commended 
<A NAME="774"></A>if they can do justice one day in five years." Theopompus answered a stranger 
<A NAME="775"></A>who talked much of his affection to the Lacedaemonians, and said that his 
<A NAME="776"></A>countrymen called him Philolacon (a lover of the Lacedaemonians), that 
<A NAME="777"></A>it had been more for his honour if they had called him Philopolites (a 
<A NAME="778"></A>lover of his own countrymen). And Plistoanax, the son of Pausanias, when 
<A NAME="779"></A>an orator of Athens said the Lacedaemonians had no learning, told him, 
<A NAME="780"></A>"You say true, Sir; we alone of all the Greeks have learned none of your 
<A NAME="781"></A>bad qualities." One asked Archidamidas what number there might be of the 
<A NAME="782"></A>Spartans, he answered: "Enough, Sir, to keep out wicked 
<A NAME="783"></A>men."
<A NAME="784"></A><BR><BR>We may see their character, too, in their very jests. For they 
<A NAME="785"></A>did not throw them out at random, but the very wit of them was grounded 
<A NAME="786"></A>upon something or other worth thinking about. For instance, one, being 
<A NAME="787"></A>asked to go hear a man who exactly counterfeited the voice of a nightingale, 
<A NAME="788"></A>answered, "Sir, I have heard the nightingale itself." Another, having read 
<A NAME="789"></A>the following inscription upon a tomb-
<A NAME="790"></A><BR><BR>"Seeking to quench a cruel tyranny,
<A NAME="791"></A><BR>They, at Selinus, did in battle die," said, it served them right; for 
<A NAME="792"></A>instead of trying to quench the tyranny, they should have let it burn out. 
<A NAME="793"></A>A lad, being offered some game-cocks that would die upon the spot, said 
<A NAME="794"></A>that he cared not for cocks that would die, but for such that would live 
<A NAME="795"></A>and kill others. Another, seeing people easing themselves on seats, said, 
<A NAME="796"></A>"God forbid I should sit where I could not get up to salute my elders." 
<A NAME="797"></A>In short, their answers were so sententious and pertinent, that one said 
<A NAME="798"></A>well that intellectual much more truly than athletic exercise was the Spartan 
<A NAME="799"></A>characteristic.
<A NAME="800"></A><BR><BR>Nor was their instruction in music and verse less carefully attended 
<A NAME="801"></A>to than their habits of grace and good-breeding in conversation. And their 
<A NAME="802"></A>very songs had a life and spirit in them that inflamed and possessed men's 
<A NAME="803"></A>minds with an enthusiasm and ardour for action; the style of them was plain 
<A NAME="804"></A>and without affectation; the subject always serious and moral; most usually, 
<A NAME="805"></A>it was in praise of such men as had died in defence of their country, or 
<A NAME="806"></A>in derision of those that had been cowards; the former they declared happy 
<A NAME="807"></A>and glorified; the life of the latter they described as most miserable 
<A NAME="808"></A>and abject. There were also vaunts of what they would do, and boasts of 
<A NAME="809"></A>what they had done, varying with the various ages, as, for example, they 
<A NAME="810"></A>had three choirs in their solemn festivals, the first of the old men, the 
<A NAME="811"></A>second of the young men, and the last of the children; the old men began 
<A NAME="812"></A>thus:-
<A NAME="813"></A><BR><BR>"We once were young, and brave, and strong;" the young men answered 
<A NAME="814"></A>them, singing:-
<A NAME="815"></A><BR><BR>"And we're so now, come on and try;" the children came last and 
<A NAME="816"></A>said:-
<A NAME="817"></A><BR><BR>"But we'll be strongest by and by."
<A NAME="818"></A><BR><BR>Indeed, if we will take the pains to consider their compositions, 
<A NAME="819"></A>some of which were still extant in our days, and the airs on the flute 
<A NAME="820"></A>to which they marched when going to battle, we shall find that Terpander 
<A NAME="821"></A>and Pindar had reason to say that musing and valour were allied. The first 
<A NAME="822"></A>says of Lacedaemon-
<A NAME="823"></A><BR><BR>"The spear and song in her do meet,
<A NAME="824"></A><BR>And justice walks about her street; And Pindar-
<A NAME="825"></A><BR><BR>"Councils of wise elders here,
<A NAME="826"></A><BR>And the young men's conquering spear,
<A NAME="827"></A><BR>And dance, and song, and joy appear; both describing the Spartans as 
<A NAME="828"></A>no less musical than warlike; in the words of one of their own 
<A NAME="829"></A>poets-
<A NAME="830"></A><BR><BR>"With the iron stern and sharp,
<A NAME="831"></A><BR>Comes the playing on the harp." For, indeed, before they engaged in 
<A NAME="832"></A>battle, the king first did sacrifice to the Muses, in all likelihood to 
<A NAME="833"></A>put them in mind of the manner of their education, and of the judgment 
<A NAME="834"></A>that would be passed upon their actions, and thereby to animate them to 
<A NAME="835"></A>the performance of exploits that should deserve a record. At such times, 
<A NAME="836"></A>too, the Lacedaemonians abated a little the severity of their manners in 
<A NAME="837"></A>favour of their young men, suffering them to curl and adorn their hair, 
<A NAME="838"></A>and to have costly arms and fine clothes; and were well pleased to see 
<A NAME="839"></A>them, like proud horses, neighing and pressing to the course. And, therefore, 
<A NAME="840"></A>as soon as they came to be well-grown, they took a great deal of care of 
<A NAME="841"></A>their hair, to have it parted and trimmed, especially against a day of 
<A NAME="842"></A>battle, pursuant to a saying recorded of their lawgiver, that a large head 
<A NAME="843"></A>of hair added beauty to a good face, and terror to an ugly 
<A NAME="844"></A>one.
<A NAME="845"></A><BR><BR>When they were in the field, their exercises were generally more 
<A NAME="846"></A>moderate, their fare not so hard, nor so strict a hand held over them by 
<A NAME="847"></A>their officers, so that they were the only people in the world to whom 
<A NAME="848"></A>war gave repose. When their army was drawn up in battle array, and the 
<A NAME="849"></A>enemy near, the king sacrificed a goat, commanded the soldiers to set their 
<A NAME="850"></A>garlands upon their heads, and the pipers to play the tune of the hymn 
<A NAME="851"></A>to Castor, and himself began the paean of advance. It was at once a magnificent 
<A NAME="852"></A>and a terrible sight to see them march on to the tune of their flutes, 
<A NAME="853"></A>without any disorder in their ranks, any discomposure in their minds, or 
<A NAME="854"></A>change in their countenances, calmly and cheerfully moving with the music 
<A NAME="855"></A>to the deadly fight. Men, in this temper, were not likely to be possessed 
<A NAME="856"></A>with fear or any transport of fury, but with the deliberate valour of hope 
<A NAME="857"></A>and assurance, as if some divinity were attending and conducting them. 
<A NAME="858"></A>The king had always about his person some one who had been crowned in the 
<A NAME="859"></A>Olympic games; and upon this account a Lacedaemonian is said to have refused 
<A NAME="860"></A>a considerable present, which was offered to him upon condition that he 
<A NAME="861"></A>would not come into the lists; and when he had with much to-do thrown his 
<A NAME="862"></A>antagonist, some of the spectators saying to him, "And now, Sir Lacedaemonian, 
<A NAME="863"></A>what are you the better for your victory?" he answered, smiling, "I shall 
<A NAME="864"></A>fight next the king." After they had routed an enemy, they pursued him 
<A NAME="865"></A>till they were well assured of the victory, and then they sounded a retreat, 
<A NAME="866"></A>thinking it base and unworthy of a Grecian people to cut men in pieces, 
<A NAME="867"></A>who had given up and abandoned all resistance. This manner of dealing with 
<A NAME="868"></A>their enemies did not only show magnanimity, but was politic too; for, 
<A NAME="869"></A>knowing that they killed only those who made resistance, and gave quarter 
<A NAME="870"></A>to the rest, men generally thought it their best way to consult their safety 
<A NAME="871"></A>by flight.
<A NAME="872"></A><BR><BR>Hippius the sophist says that Lycurgus himself was a great soldier 
<A NAME="873"></A>and an experienced commander. Philostephanus attributes to him the first 
<A NAME="874"></A>division of the cavalry into troops of fifties in a square body; but Demetrius 
<A NAME="875"></A>the Phalerian says quite the contrary, and that he made all his laws in 
<A NAME="876"></A>a continued peace. And, indeed, the Olympic holy truce, or cessation of 
<A NAME="877"></A>arms, that was procured by his means and management, inclines me to think 
<A NAME="878"></A>him a kind-natured man, and one that loved quietness and peace. Notwithstanding 
<A NAME="879"></A>all this, Hermippus tells us that he had no hand in the ordinance, that 
<A NAME="880"></A>Iphitus made it, and Lycurgus came only as a spectator, and that by mere 
<A NAME="881"></A>accident too. Being there, he heard as it were a man's voice behind him, 
<A NAME="882"></A>blaming and wondering at him that he did not encourage his countrymen to 
<A NAME="883"></A>resort to the assembly, and, turning about and seeing no man, concluded 
<A NAME="884"></A>that it was a voice from heaven, and upon this immediately went to Iphitus 
<A NAME="885"></A>and assisted him in ordering the ceremonies of that feast, which, by his 
<A NAME="886"></A>means, were better established, and with more repute than 
<A NAME="887"></A>before.
<A NAME="888"></A><BR><BR>To return to the Lacedaemonians. Their discipline continued still 
<A NAME="889"></A>after they were full-grown men. No one was allowed to live after his own 
<A NAME="890"></A>fancy; but the city was a sort of camp, in which every man had his share 
<A NAME="891"></A>of provisions and business set out, and looked upon himself not so much 
<A NAME="892"></A>born to serve his own ends as the interest of his country. Therefore if 
<A NAME="893"></A>they were commanded nothing else, they went to see the boys perform their 
<A NAME="894"></A>exercises, to teach them something useful or to learn it themselves of 
<A NAME="895"></A>those who knew better. And indeed one of the greatest and highest blessings 
<A NAME="896"></A>Lycurgus procured his people was the abundance of leisure which proceeded 
<A NAME="897"></A>from his forbidding to them the exercise of any mean and mechanical trade. 
<A NAME="898"></A>Of the money-making that depends on troublesome going about and seeing 
<A NAME="899"></A>people and doing business, they had no need at all in a state where wealth 
<A NAME="900"></A>obtained no honour or respect. The Helots tilled their ground for them, 
<A NAME="901"></A>and paid them yearly in kind the appointed quantity, without any trouble 
<A NAME="902"></A>of theirs. To this purpose there goes a story of a Lacedaemonian who, happening 
<A NAME="903"></A>to be at Athens when the courts were sitting, was told of a citizen that 
<A NAME="904"></A>had been fined for living an idle life, and was being escorted home in 
<A NAME="905"></A>much distress of mind by his condoling friends; the Lacedaemonian was much 
<A NAME="906"></A>surprised at it and desired his friend to show him the man who was condemned 
<A NAME="907"></A>for living like a freeman. So much beneath them did they esteem the frivolous 
<A NAME="908"></A>devotion of time and attention to the mechanical arts and to 
<A NAME="909"></A>moneymaking.
<A NAME="910"></A><BR><BR>It need not be said that upon the prohibition of gold and silver, 
<A NAME="911"></A>all lawsuits immediately ceased, for there was now neither avarice nor 
<A NAME="912"></A>poverty amongst them, but equality, where every one's wants were supplied, 
<A NAME="913"></A>and independence, because those wants were so small. All their time, except 
<A NAME="914"></A>when they were in the field, was taken up by the choral dances and the 
<A NAME="915"></A>festivals, in hunting, and in attendance on the exercise-grounds and the 
<A NAME="916"></A>places of public conversation. Those who were under thirty years of age 
<A NAME="917"></A>were not allowed to go into the market-place, but had the necessaries of 
<A NAME="918"></A>their family supplied by the care of their relations and lovers; nor was 
<A NAME="919"></A>it for the credit of elderly men to be seen too often in the market-place; 
<A NAME="920"></A>it was esteemed more suitable for them to frequent the exercise-grounds 
<A NAME="921"></A>and places of conversation, where they spent their leisure rationally in 
<A NAME="922"></A>conversation, not on money-making and marketprices, but for the most part 
<A NAME="923"></A>in passing judgment on some action worth considering; extolling the good, 
<A NAME="924"></A>and censuring those who were otherwise, and that in a light and sportive 
<A NAME="925"></A>manner, conveying, without too much gravity, lessons of advice and improvement. 
<A NAME="926"></A>Nor was Lycurgus himself unduly austere; it was he who dedicated, says 
<A NAME="927"></A>Sosibius, the little statue of Laughter. Mirth, introduced seasonably at 
<A NAME="928"></A>their suppers and places of common entertainment, was to serve as a sort 
<A NAME="929"></A>of sweetmeat to accompany their strict and hard life. To conclude, he bred 
<A NAME="930"></A>up his citizens in such a way that they neither would nor could live by 
<A NAME="931"></A>themselves; they were to make themselves one with the public good, and, 
<A NAME="932"></A>clustering like bees around their commander, be by their zeal and public 
<A NAME="933"></A>spirit carried all but out of themselves, and devoted wholly to their country. 
<A NAME="934"></A>What their sentiments were will better appear by a few of their sayings. 
<A NAME="935"></A>Paedaretus, not being admitted into the list of the three hundred, returned 
<A NAME="936"></A>home with a joyful face, well pleased to find that there were in Sparta 
<A NAME="937"></A>three hundred better men than himself. And Polycratidas, being sent with 
<A NAME="938"></A>some others ambassador to the lieutenants of the king of Persia, being 
<A NAME="939"></A>asked by them whether they came in a private or in a public character, 
<A NAME="940"></A>answered, "In a public, if we succeed; if not, in a private character." 
<A NAME="941"></A>Argileonis, asking some who came from Amphipolis if her son Brasidas died 
<A NAME="942"></A>courageously and as became a Spartan, on their beginning to praise him 
<A NAME="943"></A>to a high degree, and saying there was not such another left in Sparta, 
<A NAME="944"></A>answered, "Do not say so; Brasidas was a good and brave man, but there 
<A NAME="945"></A>are in Sparta many better than he."
<A NAME="946"></A><BR><BR>The senate, as I said before, consisted of those who were Lycurgus's 
<A NAME="947"></A>chief aiders and assistants in his plans. The vacancies he ordered to be 
<A NAME="948"></A>supplied out of the best and most deserving men past sixty years old, and 
<A NAME="949"></A>we need not wonder if there was much striving for it; for what more glorious 
<A NAME="950"></A>competition could there be amongst men, than one in which it was not contested 
<A NAME="951"></A>who was swiftest among the swift or strongest of the strong, but who of 
<A NAME="952"></A>many wise and good was wisest and best, and fittest to be intrusted for 
<A NAME="953"></A>ever after, as the reward of his merits, with the supreme authority of 
<A NAME="954"></A>the commonwealth, and with power over the lives, franchises, and highest 
<A NAME="955"></A>interests of all his countrymen? The manner of their election was as follows: 
<A NAME="956"></A>The people being called together, some selected persons were locked up 
<A NAME="957"></A>in a room near the place of election, so contrived that they could neither 
<A NAME="958"></A>see nor be seen, but could only hear the noise of the assembly without; 
<A NAME="959"></A>for they decided this, as most other affairs of moment, by the shouts of 
<A NAME="960"></A>the people. This done, the competitors were not brought in and presented 
<A NAME="961"></A>all together, but one after another by lot, and passed in order through 
<A NAME="962"></A>the assembly without speaking a word. Those who were locked up had writing-tables 
<A NAME="963"></A>with them, in which they recorded and marked each shout by its loudness, 
<A NAME="964"></A>without knowing in favour of which candidate each of them was made, but 
<A NAME="965"></A>merely that they came first, second, third, and so forth. He who was found 
<A NAME="966"></A>to have the most and loudest acclamations was declared senator duly elected. 
<A NAME="967"></A>Upon this he had a garland set upon his head, and went in procession to 
<A NAME="968"></A>all the temples to give thanks to the gods; a great number of young men 
<A NAME="969"></A>followed him with applauses, and women, also, singing verses in his honour, 
<A NAME="970"></A>and extolling the virtue and happiness of his life. As he went round the 
<A NAME="971"></A>city in this manner, each of his relations and friends set a table before 
<A NAME="972"></A>him, saying "The city honours you with this banquet;" but he, instead of 
<A NAME="973"></A>accepting, passed round to the common table where he formerly used to eat, 
<A NAME="974"></A>and was served as before, excepting that now he had a second allowance, 
<A NAME="975"></A>which he took and put by. By the time supper was ended, the women who were 
<A NAME="976"></A>of kin to him had come about the door; and he, beckoning to her whom he 
<A NAME="977"></A>most esteemed, presented to her the portion he had saved, saying, that 
<A NAME="978"></A>it had been a mark of esteem to him, and was so now to her; upon which 
<A NAME="979"></A>she was triumphantly waited upon home by the women.
<A NAME="980"></A><BR><BR>Touching burials, Lycurgus made very wise regulations; for, first 
<A NAME="981"></A>of all, to cut off all superstition, he allowed them to bury their dead 
<A NAME="982"></A>within the city, and even round about their temples, to the end that their 
<A NAME="983"></A>youth might be accustomed to such spectacles, and not be afraid to see 
<A NAME="984"></A>a dead body, or imagine that to touch a corpse or to tread upon a grave 
<A NAME="985"></A>would defile a man. In the next place, he commanded them to put nothing 
<A NAME="986"></A>into the ground with them, except, if they pleased, a few olive leaves, 
<A NAME="987"></A>and the scarlet cloth that they were wrapped in. He would not suffer the 
<A NAME="988"></A>names to be inscribed, except only of men who fell in the wars, or women 
<A NAME="989"></A>who died in a sacred office. The time, too, appointed for mourning, was 
<A NAME="990"></A>very short, eleven days; on the twelfth, they were to do sacrifice to Ceres, 
<A NAME="991"></A>and leave it off; so that we may see, that as he cut off all superfluity, 
<A NAME="992"></A>so in things necessary there was nothing so small and trivial which did 
<A NAME="993"></A>not express some homage of virtue or scorn of vice. He filled Lacedaemon 
<A NAME="994"></A>all through with proofs and examples of good conduct; with the constant 
<A NAME="995"></A>sight of which from their youth up the people would hardly fail to be gradually 
<A NAME="996"></A>formed and advanced in virtue.
<A NAME="997"></A><BR><BR>And this was the reason why he forbade them to travel abroad, and 
<A NAME="998"></A>go about acquainting themselves with foreign rules of morality, the habits 
<A NAME="999"></A>of ill-educated people, and different views of government. Withal he banished 
<A NAME="1000"></A>from Lacedaemon all strangers who would not give a very good reason for 
<A NAME="1001"></A>their coming thither; not because he was afraid lest they should inform 
<A NAME="1002"></A>themselves of and imitate his manner of government (as Thucydides says), 
<A NAME="1003"></A>or learn anything to their good; but rather lest they should introduce 
<A NAME="1004"></A>something contrary to good manners. With strange people, strange words 
<A NAME="1005"></A>must be admitted; these novelties produce novelties in thought; and on 
<A NAME="1006"></A>these follow views and feelings whose discordant character destroys the 
<A NAME="1007"></A>harmony of the state. He was as careful to save his city from the infection 
<A NAME="1008"></A>of foreign bad habits, as men usually are to prevent the introduction of 
<A NAME="1009"></A>a pestilence.
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR><BR>Hitherto I, for my part, see no sign of injustice or want of equity 
<A NAME="1011"></A>in the laws of Lycurgus, though some who admit them to be well contrived 
<A NAME="1012"></A>to make good soldiers, pronounce them defective in point of justice. The 
<A NAME="1013"></A>Cryptia, perhaps (if it were one of Lycurgus's ordinances, as Aristotle 
<A NAME="1014"></A>says it was), gave both him and Plato, too, this opinion alike of the lawgiver 
<A NAME="1015"></A>and his government. By this ordinance, the magistrates despatched privately 
<A NAME="1016"></A>some of the ablest of the young men into the country, from time to time, 
<A NAME="1017"></A>armed only with their daggers, and taking a little necessary provision 
<A NAME="1018"></A>with them; in the daytime, they hid themselves in out-of-the-way places, 
<A NAME="1019"></A>and there lay close, but in the night issued out into the highways, and 
<A NAME="1020"></A>killed all the Helots they could light upon; sometimes they set upon them 
<A NAME="1021"></A>by day, as they were at work in the fields, and murdered them. As, also, 
<A NAME="1022"></A>Thucydides, in his history of the Peloponnesian war, tells us, that a good 
<A NAME="1023"></A>number of them, after being singled out for their bravery by the Spartans, 
<A NAME="1024"></A>garlanded, as enfranchised persons, and led about to all the temples in 
<A NAME="1025"></A>token of honours, shortly after disappeared all of a sudden, being about 
<A NAME="1026"></A>the number of two thousand; and no man either then or since could give 
<A NAME="1027"></A>an account how they came by their deaths. And Aristotle, in particular, 
<A NAME="1028"></A>adds, that the ephori, so soon as they were entered into their office, 
<A NAME="1029"></A>used to declare war against them, that they might be massacred without 
<A NAME="1030"></A>a breach of religion. It is confessed, on all hands, that the Spartans 
<A NAME="1031"></A>dealt with them very hardly; for it was a common thing to force them to 
<A NAME="1032"></A>drink to excess, and to lead them in that condition into their public halls, 
<A NAME="1033"></A>that the children might see what a sight a drunken man is; they made them 
<A NAME="1034"></A>to dance low dances, and sing ridiculous songs, forbidding them expressly 
<A NAME="1035"></A>to meddle with any of a better kind. And accordingly, when the Thebans 
<A NAME="1036"></A>made their invasion into Laconia, and took a great number of the Helots, 
<A NAME="1037"></A>they could by no means persuade them to sing the verses of Terpander, Alcman, 
<A NAME="1038"></A>or Spendon, "For," said they, "the masters do not like it." So that it 
<A NAME="1039"></A>was truly observed by one, that in Sparta he who was free was most so, 
<A NAME="1040"></A>and he that was a slave there, the greatest slave in the world. For my 
<A NAME="1041"></A>part, I am of opinion that these outrages and cruelties began to be exercised 
<A NAME="1042"></A>in Sparta at a later time, especially after the great earthquake, when 
<A NAME="1043"></A>the Helots made a general insurrection, and, joining with the Messenians, 
<A NAME="1044"></A>laid the country waste, and brought the greatest danger upon the city. 
<A NAME="1045"></A>For I cannot persuade myself to ascribe to Lycurgus so wicked and barbarous 
<A NAME="1046"></A>a course, judging of him from the gentleness of his disposition and justice 
<A NAME="1047"></A>upon all other occasions; to which the oracle also testified.
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR><BR>When he perceived that his more important institutions had taken 
<A NAME="1049"></A>root in the minds of his countrymen, that custom had rendered them familiar 
<A NAME="1050"></A>and easy, that his commonwealth was now grown up and able to go alone, 
<A NAME="1051"></A>then, as Plato somewhere tells us, the Maker of the world, when first he 
<A NAME="1052"></A>saw it existing and beginning its motion, felt joy, even so Lycurgus, viewing 
<A NAME="1053"></A>with joy and satisfaction the greatness and beauty of his political structure, 
<A NAME="1054"></A>now fairly at work and in motion, conceived the thought to make it immortal 
<A NAME="1055"></A>too, and, as far as human forecast could reach to deliver it down unchangeable 
<A NAME="1056"></A>to posterity. He called an extraordinary assembly of all the people, and 
<A NAME="1057"></A>told them that he now thought everything reasonably well established, both 
<A NAME="1058"></A>for the happiness and the virtue of the state; but that there was one thing 
<A NAME="1059"></A>still behind, of the greatest importance, which he thought not fit to impart 
<A NAME="1060"></A>until he had consulted the oracle; in the meantime, his desire was that 
<A NAME="1061"></A>they would observe the laws without any the least alteration until his 
<A NAME="1062"></A>return, and then he would do as the god should direct him. They all consented 
<A NAME="1063"></A>readily, and bade him hasten his journey; but, before he departed, he administered 
<A NAME="1064"></A>an oath to the two kings, the senate, and the whole commons, to abide by 
<A NAME="1065"></A>and maintain the established form of polity until Lycurgus should be come 
<A NAME="1066"></A>back. This done, he set out for Delphi, and, having sacrificed to Apollo, 
<A NAME="1067"></A>asked him whether the laws he had established were good, and sufficient 
<A NAME="1068"></A>for a people's happiness and virtue. The oracle answered that the laws 
<A NAME="1069"></A>were excellent, and that the people, while it observed them, should live 
<A NAME="1070"></A>in the height of renown. Lycurgus took the oracle in writing, and sent 
<A NAME="1071"></A>it over to Sparta; and, having sacrificed the second time to Apollo, and 
<A NAME="1072"></A>taken leave of his friends and his son, he resolved that the Spartans should 
<A NAME="1073"></A>not be released from the oath they had taken, and that he would, of his 
<A NAME="1074"></A>own act, close his life where he was. He was now about that age in which 
<A NAME="1075"></A>life was still tolerable, and yet might be quitted without regret. Everything, 
<A NAME="1076"></A>moreover, about him was in a sufficiently prosperous condition. He therefore 
<A NAME="1077"></A>made an end of himself by a total abstinence from food, thinking it a statesman's 
<A NAME="1078"></A>duty to make his very death, if possible, an act of service to the state, 
<A NAME="1079"></A>and even in the end of his life to give some example of virtue and effect 
<A NAME="1080"></A>some useful purpose. He would, on the one hand, crown and consummate his 
<A NAME="1081"></A>own happiness by a death suitable to so honourable a life, and on the other 
<A NAME="1082"></A>hand, would secure to his countrymen the enjoyment of the advantages he 
<A NAME="1083"></A>had spent his life in obtaining for them, since they had solemnly sworn 
<A NAME="1084"></A>the maintenance of his institutions until his return. Nor was he deceived 
<A NAME="1085"></A>in his expectations, for the city of Lacedaemon continued the chief city 
<A NAME="1086"></A>of all Greece for the space of five hundred years, in strict observance 
<A NAME="1087"></A>of Lycurgus's laws; in all which time there was no manner of alteration 
<A NAME="1088"></A>made, during the reign of fourteen kings down to the time of Agis, the 
<A NAME="1089"></A>son of Archidamus. For the new creation of the ephori, though thought to 
<A NAME="1090"></A>be in favour of the people, was so far from diminishing, that it very much 
<A NAME="1091"></A>heightened, the aristocratical character of the government.
<A NAME="1092"></A><BR><BR>In the time of Agis, gold and silver first flowed into Sparta, 
<A NAME="1093"></A>and with them all those mischiefs which attend the immoderate desire of 
<A NAME="1094"></A>riches. Lysander promoted this disorder; for by bringing in rich spoils 
<A NAME="1095"></A>from the wars, although himself incorrupt, he yet by this means filled 
<A NAME="1096"></A>his country with avarice and luxury, and subverted the laws and ordinances 
<A NAME="1097"></A>of Lycurgus; so long as which were in force, the aspect presented by Sparta 
<A NAME="1098"></A>was rather that of a rule of life followed by one wise and temperate man, 
<A NAME="1099"></A>than of the political government of a nation. And as the poets feign of 
<A NAME="1100"></A>Hercules, that, with his lion's skin
