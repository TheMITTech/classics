<BR>(legendary, died 53 B.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Marcus CRASSUS, whose father had borne the office of a censor, and received 
<A NAME="11"></A>the honour of a triumph, was educated in a little house together with his 
<A NAME="12"></A>two brothers, who both married in their parents' lifetime; they kept but 
<A NAME="13"></A>one table amongst them; all which, perhaps, was not the least reason of 
<A NAME="14"></A>his own temperance and moderation in diet. One of his brothers dying, he 
<A NAME="15"></A>married his widow, by whom he had his children; neither was there in these 
<A NAME="16"></A>respects any of the Romans who lived a more orderly life than he did, though 
<A NAME="17"></A>later in life he was suspected to have been too familiar with one of the 
<A NAME="18"></A>vestal virgins, named Licinia, who was, nevertheless, acquitted, upon an 
<A NAME="19"></A>impeachment brought against her by one Plotinus. Licinia stood possessed 
<A NAME="20"></A>of a beautiful property in the suburbs, which Crassus desiring to purchase 
<A NAME="21"></A>at a low price, for this reason was frequent in his attentions to her, 
<A NAME="22"></A>which gave occasion to the scandal, and his avarice, so to say, serving 
<A NAME="23"></A>to clear him of the crime, he was acquitted. Nor did he leave the lady 
<A NAME="24"></A>till he had got the estate.
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><BR>People were wont to say that the many virtues of Crassus were darkened 
<A NAME="26"></A>by the one vice of avarice, and indeed he seemed to have no other but that; 
<A NAME="27"></A>for it being the most predominant, obscured others to which he was inclined. 
<A NAME="28"></A>The arguments in proof of his avarice were the vastness of his estate, 
<A NAME="29"></A>and the manner of raising it; for whereas at first he was not worth above 
<A NAME="30"></A>three hundred talents, yet, though in the course of his political life 
<A NAME="31"></A>he dedicated the tenth of all he had to Hercules, and feasted the people, 
<A NAME="32"></A>and gave to every citizen corn enough to serve him three months, upon casting 
<A NAME="33"></A>up his accounts, before he went upon his Parthian expedition, he found 
<A NAME="34"></A>his possessions to amount to seven thousand one hundred talents; most of 
<A NAME="35"></A>which, if we may scandal him with a truth, he got by fire and rapine, making 
<A NAME="36"></A>his advantages of the public calamities. For when Sylla seized the city, 
<A NAME="37"></A>and exposed to sale the goods of those that he had caused to be slain, 
<A NAME="38"></A>accounting them booty and spoils, and, indeed, calling them so too, and 
<A NAME="39"></A>was desirous of making as many, and as eminent men as he could, partakers 
<A NAME="40"></A>in the crime, Crassus never was the man that refused to accept, or give 
<A NAME="41"></A>money for them. Moreover, observing how extremely subject the city was 
<A NAME="42"></A>to fire and falling down of houses, by reason of their height and their 
<A NAME="43"></A>standing so near together, he bought slaves that were builders and architects, 
<A NAME="44"></A>and when he had collected these to the number of more than five hundred, 
<A NAME="45"></A>he made it his practice to buy houses that were on fire, and those in the 
<A NAME="46"></A>neighbourhood, which, in the immediate danger and uncertainty the proprietors 
<A NAME="47"></A>were willing to part with for little or nothing, so that the greatest part 
<A NAME="48"></A>of Rome, at one time or other, came into his hands. Yet for all he had 
<A NAME="49"></A>so many workmen, he never built anything but his own house, and used to 
<A NAME="50"></A>say that those that were addicted to building would undo themselves soon 
<A NAME="51"></A>enough without the help of other enemies. And though he had many silver 
<A NAME="52"></A>mines, and much valuable land, and labourers to work in it, yet all this 
<A NAME="53"></A>was nothing in comparison of his slaves, such a number and variety did 
<A NAME="54"></A>he possess of excellent readers, amanuenses, silversmiths, stewards and 
<A NAME="55"></A>table-waiters, whose instruction he always attended to himself, superintending 
<A NAME="56"></A>in persons, while they learned, and teaching them himself, accounting it 
<A NAME="57"></A>the main duty of a master to look over the servants that are, indeed, the 
<A NAME="58"></A>living tools of housekeeping; and in this, indeed, he was in the right, 
<A NAME="59"></A>in thinking, that is, as he used to say, that servants ought to look after 
<A NAME="60"></A>all other things, and the master after them. For economy, which in things 
<A NAME="61"></A>inanimate is but money-making, when exercised over men becomes policy. 
<A NAME="62"></A>But it was surely a mistaken judgment, when he said no man was to be accounted 
<A NAME="63"></A>rich that could not maintain an army at his own cost and charges, for war, 
<A NAME="64"></A>as Archidamus well observed, is not fed at a fixed allowance, so that there 
<A NAME="65"></A>is no saying what wealth suffices for it, and certainly it was one very 
<A NAME="66"></A>far removed from that of Marius; for when he had distributed fourteen acres 
<A NAME="67"></A>of land a man, and understood that some desired more, "God forbid," said 
<A NAME="68"></A>he, "that any Roman should think that too little which is enough to keep 
<A NAME="69"></A>him alive and well."
<A NAME="70"></A><BR><BR>Crassus, however, was very eager to be hospitable to strangers; 
<A NAME="71"></A>he kept open house, and to his friends he would lend money without interest, 
<A NAME="72"></A>but called it in precisely at the time; so that his kindness was often 
<A NAME="73"></A>thought worse than the paying the interest would have been. His entertainments 
<A NAME="74"></A>were, for the most part, plain and citizen-like, the company general and 
<A NAME="75"></A>popular; good taste and kindness made them pleasanter than sumptuosity 
<A NAME="76"></A>would have done. As for learning he chiefly cared for rhetoric, and what 
<A NAME="77"></A>would be serviceable with large numbers; he became one of the best speakers 
<A NAME="78"></A>at Rome, and by his pains and industry outdid the best natural orators. 
<A NAME="79"></A>For there was no trial how mean and contemptible soever that he came to 
<A NAME="80"></A>unprepared; nay, several times he undertook and concluded a cause when 
<A NAME="81"></A>Pompey and Caesar and Cicero refused to stand up, upon which account particularly 
<A NAME="82"></A>he got the love of the people, who looked upon him as a diligent and careful 
<A NAME="83"></A>man, ready to help and succour his fellow citizens. Besides, the people 
<A NAME="84"></A>were pleased with his courteous and unpretending salutations and greetings, 
<A NAME="85"></A>for he never met any citizen however humble and low, but he returned him 
<A NAME="86"></A>his salute by name. He was looked upon as a man well-read in history, and 
<A NAME="87"></A>pretty well versed in Aristotle's philosophy, in which one Alexander instructed 
<A NAME="88"></A>him, a man whose intercourse with Crassus gave a sufficient proof of his 
<A NAME="89"></A>good nature and gentle disposition; for it is hard to say whether he was 
<A NAME="90"></A>poorer when he entered into his service, or while he continued in it; for 
<A NAME="91"></A>being his only friend that used to accompany him when travelling, he used 
<A NAME="92"></A>to receive from him a cloak for the journey, and when he came home had 
<A NAME="93"></A>it demanded from him again; poor, patient sufferer, when even the philosophy 
<A NAME="94"></A>he professed did not look upon poverty as a thing indifferent. But of this 
<A NAME="95"></A>hereafter.
<A NAME="96"></A><BR><BR>When Cinna and Marius got the power in their hands it was soon 
<A NAME="97"></A>perceived that they had not come back for any good they intended to their 
<A NAME="98"></A>country, but to effect the ruin and utter destruction of the nobility. 
<A NAME="99"></A>And as many as they could lay their hands on they slew, amongst whom were 
<A NAME="100"></A>Crassus's father and brother; he himself, being very young, for the moment 
<A NAME="101"></A>escaped the danger; but understanding that he was every way beset and hunted 
<A NAME="102"></A>after by the tyrants, taking with him three friends and ten servants, with 
<A NAME="103"></A>all possible speed he fled into Spain, having formerly been there and secured 
<A NAME="104"></A>a great number of friends, while his father was praetor of that country. 
<A NAME="105"></A>But finding all people in a consternation, and trembling at the cruelty 
<A NAME="106"></A>of Marius, as if he was already standing over them in person, he durst 
<A NAME="107"></A>not discover himself to anybody, but hid himself in a large cave which 
<A NAME="108"></A>was by the seashore, and belonged to Vibius Pacianus, to whom he sent one 
<A NAME="109"></A>of his servants to sound him, his provisions, also, beginning to fail. 
<A NAME="110"></A>Vibius was well pleased at his escape, and inquiring the place of his abode 
<A NAME="111"></A>and the number of his companions, he went not to him himself, but commanded 
<A NAME="112"></A>his steward to provide every day a good meal's meat, and carry it and leave 
<A NAME="113"></A>it near such a rock, and to return without taking any further notice or 
<A NAME="114"></A>being inquisitive, promising him his liberty if he did as he commanded 
<A NAME="115"></A>and that he would kill him if he intermeddled. The cave is not far from 
<A NAME="116"></A>the sea; a small and insignificant looking opening in the cliffs conducts 
<A NAME="117"></A>you in; when you are entered, a wonderfully high roof spreads above you, 
<A NAME="118"></A>and large chambers open out one beyond another, nor does it lack either 
<A NAME="119"></A>water or light, for a very pleasant and wholesome spring runs at the foot 
<A NAME="120"></A>of the cliffs, and natural chinks, in the most advantageous place, let 
<A NAME="121"></A>in the light all day long, and the thickness of the rock makes the air 
<A NAME="122"></A>within pure and clear, all the wet and moisture being carried off into 
<A NAME="123"></A>the spring.
<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR>While Crassus remained here, the steward brought them what was 
<A NAME="125"></A>necessary, but never saw them, nor knew anything of the matter, though 
<A NAME="126"></A>they within saw, and expected him at the customary times. Neither was their 
<A NAME="127"></A>entertainment such as just to keep them alive, but given them in abundance 
<A NAME="128"></A>and for their enjoyment; for Pacianus resolved to treat him with all imaginable 
<A NAME="129"></A>kindness, and considering that he was a young man, thought it well to gratify 
<A NAME="130"></A>a little his youthful inclinations; for to give just what is needful seems 
<A NAME="131"></A>rather to come from necessity than from a hearty friendship. Once taking 
<A NAME="132"></A>with him two female servants, he showed them the place and bade them go 
<A NAME="133"></A>in boldly, whom when Crassus and his friends saw, they were afraid of being 
<A NAME="134"></A>betrayed and demanded what they were, and what they would have. They, according 
<A NAME="135"></A>as they were instructed, answered, they came to wait upon their master, 
<A NAME="136"></A>who was hid in that cave. And so Crassus perceiving it was a piece of pleasantry 
<A NAME="137"></A>and of good-will on the part of Vibius, took them in and kept them there 
<A NAME="138"></A>with him as long as he stayed, and employed them to give information to 
<A NAME="139"></A>Vibius of what they wanted, and how they were. Fenestella says he saw one 
<A NAME="140"></A>of them, then very old, and often heard her speak of the time and repeat 
<A NAME="141"></A>the story with pleasure.
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR>After Crassus had lain concealed there eight months, on hearing 
<A NAME="143"></A>that Cinna was dead, he appeared abroad, and a great number of people flocking 
<A NAME="144"></A>to him, out of whom he selected a body of two thousand five hundred, he 
<A NAME="145"></A>visited many cities, and, as some write, sacked Malaca, which he himself, 
<A NAME="146"></A>however, always denied, and contradicted all who said so. Afterwards, getting 
<A NAME="147"></A>together some ships, he passed into Africa, and joined with Metellus Pius, 
<A NAME="148"></A>an eminent person that had raised a very considerable force; but upon some 
<A NAME="149"></A>difference between him and Metellus, he stayed not long there, but went 
<A NAME="150"></A>over to Sylla, by whom he was very much esteemed. When Sylla passed over 
<A NAME="151"></A>into Italy, he was anxious to put all the young men that were with him 
<A NAME="152"></A>in employment; and as he despatched some one way, and some another, Crassus, 
<A NAME="153"></A>on its falling to his share to raise men among the Marsians, demanded a 
<A NAME="154"></A>guard, being to pass through the enemy's country, upon which Sylla replied 
<A NAME="155"></A>sharply, "I give you for guard your father, your brother, your friends 
<A NAME="156"></A>and kindred, whose unjust and cruel murder I am now going to revenge;" 
<A NAME="157"></A>and Crassus, being nettled, went his way, broke boldly through the enemy, 
<A NAME="158"></A>collected a considerable force, and in all Sylla's wars acted with great 
<A NAME="159"></A>zeal and courage. And in these times and occasions, they say, began the 
<A NAME="160"></A>emulation and rivalry for glory between him and Pompey; for though Pompey 
<A NAME="161"></A>was the younger man, and had the disadvantage to be descended of a father 
<A NAME="162"></A>that was disesteemed by the citizens, and hated as much as ever man was, 
<A NAME="163"></A>yet in these actions he shone out and was proved so great that Sylla always 
<A NAME="164"></A>used, when he came in, to stand up and uncover his head, an honour which 
<A NAME="165"></A>he seldom showed to older men and his own equals, and always saluted him 
<A NAME="166"></A>Imperator. This fired and stung Crassus, though, indeed, he could not with 
<A NAME="167"></A>any fairness claim to be preferred; for he both wanted experience, and 
<A NAME="168"></A>his two innate vices, sordidness and avarice, tarnished all the lustre 
<A NAME="169"></A>of his actions. For when he had taken Tudertia, a town of the Umbrians, 
<A NAME="170"></A>he converted, it was said, all the spoils to his own use, for which he 
<A NAME="171"></A>was complained of to Sylla. But in the last and greatest battle before 
<A NAME="172"></A>Rome itself when Sylla was worsted, some of his battalions giving ground, 
<A NAME="173"></A>and others being quite broken, Crassus got the victory on the right wing, 
<A NAME="174"></A>which he commanded, and pursued the enemy till night, and then sent to 
<A NAME="175"></A>Sylla to acquaint him with his success, and demand provision for his soldiers. 
<A NAME="176"></A>In the time, however, of the proscriptions and sequestrations, he lost 
<A NAME="177"></A>his repute again, by making great purchases for little or nothing, and 
<A NAME="178"></A>asking for grants. Nay, they say he proscribed one of the Bruttians without 
<A NAME="179"></A>Sylla's order, only for his own profit, and that, on discovering this, 
<A NAME="180"></A>Sylla never after trusted him in any public affairs. As no man was more 
<A NAME="181"></A>cunning than Crassus to ensnare others by flattery, so no man lay more 
<A NAME="182"></A>open to it, or swallowed it more greedily than himself. And this particularly 
<A NAME="183"></A>was observed of him, that though he was the most covetous man in the world, 
<A NAME="184"></A>yet he habitually disliked and cried out against others who were 
<A NAME="185"></A>so.
<A NAME="186"></A><BR><BR>It troubled him to see Pompey so successful in all his undertakings; 
<A NAME="187"></A>that he had had a triumph before he was capable to sit in the senate, and 
<A NAME="188"></A>that the people had surnamed him Magnus, or the great. When somebody was 
<A NAME="189"></A>saying Pompey the Great was coming, he smiled, and asked him, "How big 
<A NAME="190"></A>is he?" Despairing to equal him by feats of arms, he betook himself to 
<A NAME="191"></A>civil life, where by doing kindnesses, pleading, lending money, by speaking 
<A NAME="192"></A>and canvassing among the people for those who had objects to obtain from 
<A NAME="193"></A>them, he gradually gained as great honour and power as Pompey had from 
<A NAME="194"></A>his many famous expeditions. And it was a curious thing in their rivalry, 
<A NAME="195"></A>that Pompey's name and interests in the city was greatest when he was absent, 
<A NAME="196"></A>for his renown in war, but when present he was often less successful than 
<A NAME="197"></A>Crassus, by reason of his superciliousness and haughty way of living, shunning 
<A NAME="198"></A>crowds of people, and appearing rarely in the forum, and assisting only 
<A NAME="199"></A>some few, and that not readily, that his interests might be the stronger 
<A NAME="200"></A>when he came to use it for himself. Whereas Crassus, being a friend always 
<A NAME="201"></A>at hand, ready to be had and easy of access, and always with his hands 
<A NAME="202"></A>full of other people's business, with his freedom and courtesy, got the 
<A NAME="203"></A>better of Pompey's formality. In point of dignity of person, eloquence 
<A NAME="204"></A>of language, and attractiveness of countenance, they were pretty equally 
<A NAME="205"></A>excellent. But, however, this emulation never transported Crassus so far 
<A NAME="206"></A>as to make him bear enmity or any ill-will; for though he was vexed to 
<A NAME="207"></A>see Pompey and Caesar preferred to him, yet he never mingled any hostility 
<A NAME="208"></A>or malice with his jealousy; though Caesar, when he was taken captive by 
<A NAME="209"></A>the corsairs in Asia, cried out, "O Crassus, how glad you will be at the 
<A NAME="210"></A>news of my captivity!" Afterwards they lived together on friendly terms, 
<A NAME="211"></A>for when Caesar was going praetor into Spain, and his creditors, he being 
<A NAME="212"></A>then in want of money, came upon him and seized his equipage, Crassus then 
<A NAME="213"></A>stood by him and relieved him, and was his security for eight hundred and 
<A NAME="214"></A>thirty talents. And in general, Rome being divided into three great interests, 
<A NAME="215"></A>those of Pompey, Caesar, and Crassus (for as for Cato, his fame was greater 
<A NAME="216"></A>than his power, and he was rather admired than followed), the sober and 
<A NAME="217"></A>quiet part were for Pompey, the restless and hot-headed followed Caesar's 
<A NAME="218"></A>ambition, but Crassus trimmed between them, making advantages of both, 
<A NAME="219"></A>and changed sides continually, being neither a trusty friend nor an implacable 
<A NAME="220"></A>enemy, and easily abandoned both his attachments and his animosities, as 
<A NAME="221"></A>he found it for his advantage, so that in short spaces of time the same 
<A NAME="222"></A>men and the same measures had him both as their supporter and as their 
<A NAME="223"></A>opponent. He was much liked, but was feared as much or even more. At any 
<A NAME="224"></A>rate, when Sicinius, who was the greatest troubler of the magistrates and 
<A NAME="225"></A>ministers of his time, was asked how it was he let Crassus alone, "Oh," 
<A NAME="226"></A>said he, "he carries hay on his horns," alluding to the custom of tying 
<A NAME="227"></A>hay to the horns of the bull that used to butt, that people might keep 
<A NAME="228"></A>out of his way.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR><BR>The insurrection of the gladiators and the devastation of Italy, 
<A NAME="230"></A>commonly called the war of Spartacus, began upon this occasion. One Lentulus 
<A NAME="231"></A>Batiates trained up a great many gladiators in Capua, most of them Gauls 
<A NAME="232"></A>and Thracians, who, not for any fault by them committed, but simply through 
<A NAME="233"></A>the cruelty of their master, were kept in confinement for this object of 
<A NAME="234"></A>fighting one with another. Two hundred of these formed a plan to escape, 
<A NAME="235"></A>but being discovered, those of them who became aware of it in time to anticipate 
<A NAME="236"></A>their master, being seventy-eight, got out of a cook's shop chopping-knives 
<A NAME="237"></A>and spits, and made their way through the city, and lighting by the way 
<A NAME="238"></A>on several wagons that were carrying gladiators' arms to another city, 
<A NAME="239"></A>they seized upon them and armed themselves. And seizing upon a defensible 
<A NAME="240"></A>place, they chose three captains, of whom Spartacus was chief, a Thracian 
<A NAME="241"></A>of one of the nomad tribes, and a man not only of high spirit and valiant, 
<A NAME="242"></A>but in understanding, also, and in gentleness superior to his condition, 
<A NAME="243"></A>and more of a Grecian than the people of his country usually are. When 
<A NAME="244"></A>he first came to be sold at Rome, they say a snake coiled itself upon his 
<A NAME="245"></A>face as he lay asleep, and his wife, who at this latter time also accompanied 
<A NAME="246"></A>him in his flight, his countrywoman, a kind of prophetess, and one of those 
<A NAME="247"></A>possessed with the bacchanal frenzy, declared that it was a sign portending 
<A NAME="248"></A>great and formidable power to him with no happy event.
<A NAME="249"></A><BR><BR>First, then, routing those that came out of Capua against them, 
<A NAME="250"></A>and thus procuring a quantity of proper soldiers' arms, they gladly threw 
<A NAME="251"></A>away their own as barbarous and dishonourable. Afterwards Clodius, the 
<A NAME="252"></A>praetor, took the command against them with a body of three thousand men 
<A NAME="253"></A>from Rome, and besieged them within a mountain, accessible only by one 
<A NAME="254"></A>narrow and difficult passage, which Clodius kept guarded, encompassed on 
<A NAME="255"></A>all other sides with steep and slippery precipices. Upon the top, however, 
<A NAME="256"></A>grew a great many wild vines, and cutting down as many of their boughs 
<A NAME="257"></A>as they had need of, they twisted them into strong ladders long enough 
<A NAME="258"></A>to reach from thence to the bottom, by which, without any danger, they 
<A NAME="259"></A>got down all but one, who stayed there to throw them down their arms, and 
<A NAME="260"></A>after this succeeded in saving himself. The Romans were ignorant of all 
<A NAME="261"></A>this, and, therefore, coming upon them in the rear, they assaulted them 
<A NAME="262"></A>unawares and took their camp. Several, also, of the shepherds and herdsmen 
<A NAME="263"></A>that were there, stout and nimble fellows, revolted over to them, to some 
<A NAME="264"></A>of whom they gave complete arms, and made use of others as scouts and light-armed 
<A NAME="265"></A>soldiers. Publius Varinus, the praetor, was now sent against them, whose 
<A NAME="266"></A>lieutenant, Furius, with two thousand men, they fought and routed. Then 
<A NAME="267"></A>Cossinius was sent with considerable forces, to give his assistance and 
<A NAME="268"></A>advice, and him Spartacus missed but very little of capturing in person, 
<A NAME="269"></A>as he was bathing at Salinae; for he with great difficulty made his escape, 
<A NAME="270"></A>while Spartacus possessed himself of his baggage, and following the chase 
<A NAME="271"></A>with a great slaughter, stormed his camp and took it, where Cossinius himself 
<A NAME="272"></A>was slain. After many successful skirmishes with the praetor himself, in 
<A NAME="273"></A>one of which he took his lictors and his own horse, he began to be great 
<A NAME="274"></A>and terrible; but wisely considering that he was not to expect to match 
<A NAME="275"></A>the force of the empire, he marched his army towards the Alps, intending, 
<A NAME="276"></A>when he had passed them, that every man should go to his own home, some 
<A NAME="277"></A>to Thrace, some to Gaul. But they, grown confident in their numbers, and 
<A NAME="278"></A>puffed up with their success, would give no obedience to him, but went 
<A NAME="279"></A>about and ravaged Italy; so that now the senate was not only moved at the 
<A NAME="280"></A>indignity and baseness, both of the enemy and of the insurrection, but, 
<A NAME="281"></A>looking upon it as a matter of alarm and of dangerous consequence, sent 
<A NAME="282"></A>out both the consuls to it, as to a great and difficult enterprise. The 
<A NAME="283"></A>consul Gellius, falling suddenly upon a party of Germans, who through contempt, 
<A NAME="284"></A>and confidence had straggled from Spartacus, cut them all to pieces. But 
<A NAME="285"></A>when Lentulus with a large army besieged Spartacus, he sallied out upon 
<A NAME="286"></A>him, and, joining battle, defeated his chief officers, and captured all 
<A NAME="287"></A>his baggage. As he made toward the Alps, Cassius, who was praetor of that 
<A NAME="288"></A>part of Gaul that lies about the Po, met him with ten thousand men, but 
<A NAME="289"></A>being overcome in the battle, he had much ado to escape himself, with the 
<A NAME="290"></A>loss of a great many of his men.
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR>When the senate understood this, they were displeased at the consuls, 
<A NAME="292"></A>and ordering them to meddle no further, they appointed Crassus general 
<A NAME="293"></A>of the war, and a great many of the nobility went volunteers with him, 
<A NAME="294"></A>partly out of friendship, and partly to get honour. He stayed himself on 
<A NAME="295"></A>the borders of Picenum, expecting Spartacus would come that way, and sent 
<A NAME="296"></A>his lieutenant, Mummius, with two legions, to wheel about and observe the 
<A NAME="297"></A>enemy's motions, but upon no account to engage or skirmish. But he, upon 
<A NAME="298"></A>the first opportunity, joined battle, and was routed, having a great many 
<A NAME="299"></A>of his men slain, and a great many only saving their lives with the loss 
<A NAME="300"></A>of their arms. Crassus rebuked Mummius severely, and arming the soldiers 
<A NAME="301"></A>again, he made them find sureties for their arms, that they would part 
<A NAME="302"></A>with them no more, and five hundred that were the beginners of the flight 
<A NAME="303"></A>he divided into fifty tens, and one of each was to die by lot, thus reviving 
<A NAME="304"></A>the ancient Roman punishment of decimation, where ignominy is added to 
<A NAME="305"></A>the penalty of death, with a variety of appalling and terrible circumstances, 
<A NAME="306"></A>presented before the eyes of the whole army, assembled as spectators. When 
<A NAME="307"></A>he had thus reclaimed his men, he led them against the enemy; but Spartacus 
<A NAME="308"></A>retreated through Lucania toward the sea, and in the straits meeting with 
<A NAME="309"></A>some Cilician pirate ships, he had thoughts of attempting Sicily, where, 
<A NAME="310"></A>by landing two thousand men, he hoped to new kindle the war of the slaves, 
<A NAME="311"></A>which was but lately extinguished, and seemed to need but little fuel to 
<A NAME="312"></A>set it burning again. But after the pirates had struck a bargain with him, 
<A NAME="313"></A>and received his earnest they deceived him and sailed away. He thereupon 
<A NAME="314"></A>retired again from the sea, and established his army in the peninsula of 
<A NAME="315"></A>Rhegium; there Crassus came upon him, and considering the nature of the 
<A NAME="316"></A>place, which of itself suggested the undertaking, he set to work to build 
<A NAME="317"></A>a wall across the isthmus; thus keeping his soldiers at once from idleness 
<A NAME="318"></A>and his foes from forage. This great and difficult work he perfected in 
<A NAME="319"></A>a space of time short beyond all expectation, making a ditch from one sea 
<A NAME="320"></A>to the other, over the neck of land, three hundred furlongs long, fifteen 
<A NAME="321"></A>feet broad, and as much in depth, and above it built a wonderfully high 
<A NAME="322"></A>and strong wall. All which Spartacus at first slighted and despised, but 
<A NAME="323"></A>when provisions began to fail, and on his proposing to pass further, he 
<A NAME="324"></A>found he was walled in, and no more was to be had in the peninsula, taking 
<A NAME="325"></A>the opportunity of a snowy, stormy night, he filled up part of the ditch 
<A NAME="326"></A>with earth and boughs of trees, and so passed the third part of his army 
<A NAME="327"></A>over.
<A NAME="328"></A><BR><BR>Crassus was afraid lest he should march directly to Rome, but was 
<A NAME="329"></A>soon eased of that fear when he saw many of his men break out in a mutiny 
<A NAME="330"></A>and quit him, and encamped by themselves upon the Lucanian lake. This lake 
<A NAME="331"></A>they say changes at intervals of time, and is sometimes sweet, and sometimes 
<A NAME="332"></A>so salt that it cannot be drunk. Crassus falling upon these beat them from 
<A NAME="333"></A>the lake, but he could not pursue the slaughter, because of Spartacus suddenly 
<A NAME="334"></A>coming up and checking the flight. Now he began to repent that he had previously 
<A NAME="335"></A>written to the senate to call Lucullus out of Thrace, and Pompey out of 
<A NAME="336"></A>Spain; so that he did all he could to finish the war before they came, 
<A NAME="337"></A>knowing that the honour of the action would redound to him that came to 
<A NAME="338"></A>his assistance. Resolving, therefore, first to set upon those that had 
<A NAME="339"></A>mutinied and encamped apart, whom Caius Cannicius and Castus commanded, 
<A NAME="340"></A>he sent six thousand men before to secure a little eminence, and to do 
<A NAME="341"></A>it as privately as possible, which that they might do they covered their 
<A NAME="342"></A>helmets, but being discovered by two women that were sacrificing for the 
<A NAME="343"></A>enemy, they had been in great hazard, had not Crassus immediately appeared, 
<A NAME="344"></A>and engaged in a battle which proved a most bloody one. Of twelve thousand 
<A NAME="345"></A>three hundred whom he killed, two only were found wounded in their backs, 
<A NAME="346"></A>the rest all having died standing in their ranks and fighting bravely. 
<A NAME="347"></A>Spartacus, after this discomfiture, retired to the mountains of Petelia, 
<A NAME="348"></A>but Quintius, one of Crassus's officers, and Scrofa, the quaestor, pursued 
<A NAME="349"></A>and overtook him. But when Spartacus rallied and faced them, they were 
<A NAME="350"></A>utterly routed and fled, and had much ado to carry off their quaestor, 
<A NAME="351"></A>who was wounded. This success, however, ruined Spartacus, because it encouraged 
<A NAME="352"></A>the slaves, who now disdained any longer to avoid fighting, or to obey 
<A NAME="353"></A>their officers, but as they were upon the march, they came to them with 
<A NAME="354"></A>their swords in their hands, and compelled them to lead them back again 
<A NAME="355"></A>through Lucania, against the Romans, the very thing which Crassus was eager 
<A NAME="356"></A>for. For news was already brought that Pompey was at hand; and people began 
<A NAME="357"></A>to talk openly that the honour of this war was reserved to him, who would 
<A NAME="358"></A>come and at once oblige the enemy to fight and put an end to the war. Crassus, 
<A NAME="359"></A>therefore, eager to fight a decisive battle, encamped very near the enemy, 
<A NAME="360"></A>and began to make lines of circumvallation; but the slaves made a sally 
<A NAME="361"></A>and attacked the pioneers. As fresh supplies came in on either side, Spartacus, 
<A NAME="362"></A>seeing there was no avoiding it, set all his army in array, and when his 
<A NAME="363"></A>horse was brought him, he drew out his sword and killed him, saying, if 
<A NAME="364"></A>he got the day he should have a great many better horses of the enemies', 
<A NAME="365"></A>and if he lost it he should have no need of this. And so making directly 
<A NAME="366"></A>towards Crassus himself, through the midst of arms and wounds, he missed 
<A NAME="367"></A>him, but slew two centurions that fell upon him together. At last being 
<A NAME="368"></A>deserted by those that were about him, he himself stood his ground, and, 
<A NAME="369"></A>surrounded by the enemy, bravely defending himself, was cut in pieces. 
<A NAME="370"></A>But though Crassus had good fortune, and not only did the part of a good 
<A NAME="371"></A>general, but gallantly exposed his person, yet Pompey had much of the credit 
<A NAME="372"></A>of the action. For he met with many of the fugitives, and slew them, and 
<A NAME="373"></A>wrote to the senate that Crassus indeed had vanquished the slaves in a 
<A NAME="374"></A>pitched battle, but that he had put an end to the war, Pompey was honoured 
<A NAME="375"></A>with a magnificent triumph for his conquest over Sertorius and Spain, while 
<A NAME="376"></A>Crassus could not himself so much as desire a triumph in its full form, 
<A NAME="377"></A>and indeed it was thought to look but meanly in him to accept of the lesser 
<A NAME="378"></A>honour, called the ovation, for a servile war, and perform a procession 
<A NAME="379"></A>on foot. The difference between this and the other, and the origin of the 
<A NAME="380"></A>name, are explained in the life of Marcellus.
<A NAME="381"></A><BR><BR>And Pompey being immediately invited to the consulship, Crassus, 
<A NAME="382"></A>who had hoped to be joined with him, did not scruple to request his assistance. 
<A NAME="383"></A>Pompey most readily seized the opportunity, as he desired by all means 
<A NAME="384"></A>to lay some obligation upon Crassus, and zealously promoted his interest; 
<A NAME="385"></A>and at last he declared in one of his speeches to the people that he should 
<A NAME="386"></A>be not less beholden to them for his colleague than for the honour of his 
<A NAME="387"></A>own appointment. But once entered upon the employment, this amity continued 
<A NAME="388"></A>not long; but differing almost in everything, disagreeing, quarrelling, 
<A NAME="389"></A>and contending, they spent the time of their consulship without effecting 
<A NAME="390"></A>any measure of consequence, except that Crassus made a great sacrifice 
<A NAME="391"></A>to Hercules, and feasted the people at ten thousand tables, and measured 
<A NAME="392"></A>them out corn for three months. When their command was now ready to expire, 
<A NAME="393"></A>and they were, as it happened, addressing the people, a Roman knight, one 
<A NAME="394"></A>Onatius Aurelius, an ordinary private person, living in the country, mounted 
<A NAME="395"></A>the hustings, and declared a vision he had in his sleep. "Jupiter," said 
<A NAME="396"></A>he, "appeared to me, and commanded me to tell you, that you should not 
<A NAME="397"></A>suffer your consuls to lay down their charge before they are made friends." 
<A NAME="398"></A>When he had spoken, the people cried out that they should be reconciled. 
<A NAME="399"></A>Pompey stood still and said nothing, but Crassus, first offering him his 
<A NAME="400"></A>hand, said, "I cannot think, my countrymen, that I do anything humiliating 
<A NAME="401"></A>or unworthy of myself, if I make the first offers of accommodation and 
<A NAME="402"></A>friendship with Pompey, whom you yourselves styled the Great before he 
<A NAME="403"></A>was of man's estate, and decreed him a triumph before he was capable of 
<A NAME="404"></A>sitting in the senate."
<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR>This is what was memorable in Crassus's consulship, but as for 
<A NAME="406"></A>his censorship, that was altogether idle and inactive, for he neither made 
<A NAME="407"></A>a scrutiny of the senate, nor took a review of the horsemen, nor a census 
<A NAME="408"></A>of the people, though he had as mild a man as could be desired for his 
<A NAME="409"></A>colleague, Lutatius Catulus. It is said, indeed, that when Crassus intended 
<A NAME="410"></A>a violent and unjust measure, which was the reducing Egypt to be tributary 
<A NAME="411"></A>to Rome, Catulus strongly opposed it, and falling out about it, they laid 
<A NAME="412"></A>down their office by consent. In the great conspiracy of Catiline, which 
<A NAME="413"></A>was very near subverting the government, Crassus was not without some suspicion 
<A NAME="414"></A>of being concerned, and one man came forward and declared him to be in 
<A NAME="415"></A>the plot; but nobody credited him. Yet Cicero, in one of his orations, 
<A NAME="416"></A>clearly charges both Crassus and Caesar with the guilt of it, though that 
<A NAME="417"></A>speech was not published till they were both dead. But in his speech upon 
<A NAME="418"></A>his consulship, he declares that Crassus came to him by night, and brought 
<A NAME="419"></A>a letter concerning Catiline, stating the details of the conspiracy. Crassus 
<A NAME="420"></A>hated him ever after, but was hindered by his son from doing him any injury; 
<A NAME="421"></A>for Publius was a great lover of learning and eloquence, and a constant 
<A NAME="422"></A>follower of Cicero, insomuch that he put himself into mourning when he 
<A NAME="423"></A>was accused, and induced the other young men to do the same. And at last 
<A NAME="424"></A>he reconciled him to his father.
<A NAME="425"></A><BR><BR>Caesar now returning from his command, and designing to get the 
<A NAME="426"></A>consulship, and seeing that Crassus and Pompey were again at variance, 
<A NAME="427"></A>was unwilling to disoblige one by making application to the other, and 
<A NAME="428"></A>despaired of success without the help of one of them; he therefore made 
<A NAME="429"></A>it his business to reconcile them, making it appear that by weakening each 
<A NAME="430"></A>other's influence they were promoting the interest of the Ciceros, the 
<A NAME="431"></A>Catuli, and the Catos, who would really be of no account if they would 
<A NAME="432"></A>join their interests and their factions, and act together in public with 
<A NAME="433"></A>one policy and one united power. And so reconciling them by his persuasions, 
<A NAME="434"></A>out of the three parties he set up one irresistible power, which utterly 
<A NAME="435"></A>subverted the government both of senate and people. Not that he made either 
<A NAME="436"></A>Pompey or Crassus greater than they were before, but by their means made 
<A NAME="437"></A>himself greatest of all; for by the help of the adherents of both, he was 
<A NAME="438"></A>at once gloriously declared consul, which office when he administered with 
<A NAME="439"></A>credit, they decreed him the command of an army, and allotted him Gaul 
<A NAME="440"></A>for his province, and so placed him as it were in the citadel, not doubting 
<A NAME="441"></A>but they should divide the rest at their pleasure between themselves, when 
<A NAME="442"></A>they had confirmed him in his allotted command. Pompey was actuated in 
<A NAME="443"></A>all this by an immoderate desire of ruling, but Crassus, adding to his 
<A NAME="444"></A>old disease of covetousness, a new passion after trophies and triumphs, 
<A NAME="445"></A>emulous of Caesar's exploits, not content to be beneath him in these points, 
<A NAME="446"></A>though above him in all others, could not be at rest, till it ended in 
<A NAME="447"></A>an ignominious overthrow and a public calamity. When Caesar came out of 
<A NAME="448"></A>Gaul to Lucca, a great many went thither from Rome to meet him. Pompey 
<A NAME="449"></A>and Crassus had various conferences with him in secret, in which they came 
<A NAME="450"></A>to the resolution to proceed to still more decisive steps, and to get the 
<A NAME="451"></A>whole management of affairs into their hands, Caesar to keep his army, 
<A NAME="452"></A>and Pompey and Crassus to obtain new ones and new provinces. To effect 
<A NAME="453"></A>all which there was but one way, the getting the consulate a second time, 
<A NAME="454"></A>which they were to stand for, and Caesar to assist them by writing to his 
<A NAME="455"></A>friends and sending many of his soldiers to vote.
<A NAME="456"></A><BR><BR>But when they returned to Rome, their design was presently suspected, 
<A NAME="457"></A>and a report was soon spread that this interview had been for no good. 
<A NAME="458"></A>When Marcellinus and Domitius asked Pompey in the senate if he intended 
<A NAME="459"></A>to stand for the consulship, he answered, perhaps he would, perhaps not; 
<A NAME="460"></A>and being urged again, replied, he would ask it of the honest citizens, 
<A NAME="461"></A>but not of the dishonest. Which answer appearing too haughty and arrogant, 
<A NAME="462"></A>Crassus said, more modestly, that he would desire it if it might be for 
<A NAME="463"></A>the advantage of the public, otherwise he would decline it. Upon this some 
<A NAME="464"></A>others took confidence and came forward as candidates, among them Domitius. 
<A NAME="465"></A>But when Pompey and Crassus now openly appeared for it, the rest were afraid 
<A NAME="466"></A>and drew back; only Cato encouraged Domitius, who was his friend and relation, 
<A NAME="467"></A>to proceed, exciting him to persist, as though he was now defending the 
<A NAME="468"></A>public liberty, as these men, he said, did not so much aim at the consulate 
<A NAME="469"></A>as at arbitrary government, and it was not a petition for office, but a 
<A NAME="470"></A>seizure of provinces and armies. Thus spoke and thought Cato, and almost 
<A NAME="471"></A>forcibly compelled Domitius to appear in the forum, where many sided with 
<A NAME="472"></A>them. For there was, indeed, much wonder and question among the people, 
<A NAME="473"></A>"Why should Pompey and Crassus want another consulship? and why they two 
<A NAME="474"></A>together, and not with some third person? We have a great many men not 
<A NAME="475"></A>unworthy to be fellow-consuls with either the one or the other." Pompey's 
<A NAME="476"></A>party, being apprehensive of this, committed all manner of indecencies 
<A NAME="477"></A>and violences, and amongst other things lay in wait for Domitius, as he 
<A NAME="478"></A>was coming thither before daybreak with his friends; his torch-bearer they 
<A NAME="479"></A>killed, and wounded several others, of whom Cato was one. And these being 
<A NAME="480"></A>beaten back and driven into a house, Pompey and Crassus were proclaimed 
<A NAME="481"></A>consuls. Not long after, they surrounded the house with armed men, thrust 
<A NAME="482"></A>Cato out of the forum, killed some that made resistance, and decreed Caesar 
<A NAME="483"></A>his command for five years longer, and provinces for themselves, Syria 
<A NAME="484"></A>and both the Spains, which being divided by lots, Syria fell to Crassus, 
<A NAME="485"></A>and the Spains to Pompey.
<A NAME="486"></A><BR><BR>All were well pleased with the change, for the people were desirous 
<A NAME="487"></A>that Pompey should go far from the city, and he, being extremely fond of 
<A NAME="488"></A>his wife, was very glad to continue there; but Crassus was so transported 
<A NAME="489"></A>with his fortune, that it was manifest he thought he had never had such 
<A NAME="490"></A>good luck befall him as now, so that he had much to do to contain himself 
<A NAME="491"></A>before company and strangers; but amongst his private friends he let fall 
<A NAME="492"></A>many vain and childish words, which were unworthy of his age, and contrary 
<A NAME="493"></A>to his usual character, for he had been very little given to boasting hitherto. 
<A NAME="494"></A>But then being strangely puffed up, and his head heated, he would not limit 
<A NAME="495"></A>his fortune with Parthia and Syria; but looking on the actions of Lucullus 
<A NAME="496"></A>against Tigranes and the exploits of Pompey against Mithridates as but 
<A NAME="497"></A>child's play, he proposed to himself in his hopes to pass as far as Bactria 
<A NAME="498"></A>and India, and the utmost ocean. Not that he was called upon by the decree 
<A NAME="499"></A>which appointed him to his office to undertake any expedition against the 
<A NAME="500"></A>Parthians, but it was well known that he was eager for it, and Caesar wrote 
<A NAME="501"></A>to him out of Gaul commending his resolution, and inciting him to the war. 
<A NAME="502"></A>And when Ateius, the tribune of the people, designed to stop his journey, 
<A NAME="503"></A>and many others murmured that one man should undertake a war against a 
<A NAME="504"></A>people that had done them no injury, and were at amity with them, he desired 
<A NAME="505"></A>Pompey to stand by him and accompany him out of the town, as he had a great 
<A NAME="506"></A>name amongst the common people. And when several were ready prepared to 
<A NAME="507"></A>interfere and raise an outcry, Pompey appeared with a pleasing countenance, 
<A NAME="508"></A>and so mollified the people, that they let Crassus pass quietly. Ateius, 
<A NAME="509"></A>however, met him, and first by word of mouth warned and conjured him not 
<A NAME="510"></A>to proceed, and then commanded his attendant officer to seize him and detain 
<A NAME="511"></A>him; but the other tribunes not permitting it, the officer released Crassus. 
<A NAME="512"></A>Ateius, therefore, running to the gate, when Crassus was come thither, 
<A NAME="513"></A>set down a chafing-dish with lighted fire in it, and burning incense and 
<A NAME="514"></A>pouring libations on it, cursed him with dreadful imprecations, calling 
<A NAME="515"></A>upon and naming several strange and horrible deities. In the Roman belief 
<A NAME="516"></A>there is so much virtue in these sacred and ancient rites, that no man 
<A NAME="517"></A>can escape the effects of them, and that the utterer himself seldom prospers; 
<A NAME="518"></A>so that they are not often made use of, and but upon a great occasion. 
<A NAME="519"></A>And Ateius was blamed at the time for resorting to them, as the city itself, 
<A NAME="520"></A>in whose cause he used them, would be the first to feel the ill effects 
<A NAME="521"></A>of these curses and supernatural terrors.
<A NAME="522"></A><BR><BR>Crassus arrived at Brundusium, and though the sea was very rough, 
<A NAME="523"></A>he had not patience to wait, but went on board, and lost many of his ships. 
<A NAME="524"></A>With the remnant of his army he marched rapidly through Galatia, where 
<A NAME="525"></A>meeting with King Deiotarus, who, though he was very old, was about building 
<A NAME="526"></A>a new city, Crassus scoffingly told him, "Your majesty begins to build 
<A NAME="527"></A>at the twelfth hour." "Neither do you," said he, "O general, undertake 
<A NAME="528"></A>your Parthian expedition very early." For Crassus was then sixty years 
<A NAME="529"></A>old, and he seemed older than he was. At his first coming, things went 
<A NAME="530"></A>as he would have them, for he made a bridge over the Euphrates, without 
<A NAME="531"></A>much difficulty, and passed over his army in safety, and occupied many 
<A NAME="532"></A>cities of Mesopotamia, which yielded voluntarily. But a hundred of his 
<A NAME="533"></A>men were killed in one, in which Apollonius was tyrant; therefore, bringing 
<A NAME="534"></A>his forces against it, he took it by storm, plundered the goods, and sold 
<A NAME="535"></A>the inhabitants. The Greeks call this city Zenodotia, upon the taking of 
<A NAME="536"></A>which he permitted the army to salute him Imperator, but this was very 
<A NAME="537"></A>ill thought of, and it looked as if he despaired a nobler achievement, 
<A NAME="538"></A>that he made so much of this little success. Putting garrisons of seven 
<A NAME="539"></A>thousand foot and one thousand horse in the new conquests, he returned 
<A NAME="540"></A>to take up his winter quarters in Syria, where his son was to meet him 
<A NAME="541"></A>coming from Caesar out of Gaul, decorated with rewards for his valour, 
<A NAME="542"></A>and bringing with him one thousand select horse. Here Crassus seemed to 
<A NAME="543"></A>commit his first error, and except, indeed, the whole expedition, his greatest; 
<A NAME="544"></A>for, whereas he ought to have gone forward and seized Babylon and Seleucia, 
<A NAME="545"></A>cities that were ever at enmity with the Parthians, he gave the enemy time 
<A NAME="546"></A>to provide against him. Besides, he spent his time in Syria more like an 
<A NAME="547"></A>usurer than a general, not in taking an account of the arms, and in improving 
<A NAME="548"></A>the skill and discipline of his soldiers, but in computing the revenue 
<A NAME="549"></A>of the cities, wasting many days in weighing by scale and balance the treasure 
<A NAME="550"></A>that was in the temple of Hierapolis, issuing requisitions for levies of 
<A NAME="551"></A>soldiers upon particular towns and kingdoms, and then again withdrawing 
<A NAME="552"></A>them on payment of sums of money, by which he lost his credit and became 
<A NAME="553"></A>despised. Here, too, he met with the first ill-omen from that goddess, 
<A NAME="554"></A>whom some call Venus, others Juno, others Nature, or the Cause that produces 
<A NAME="555"></A>out of moisture the first principles and seeds of all things, and gives 
<A NAME="556"></A>mankind their earliest knowledge of all that is good for them. For as they 
<A NAME="557"></A>were going out of the temple young Crassus stumbled and his father fell 
<A NAME="558"></A>upon him.
<A NAME="559"></A><BR><BR>When he drew his army out of winter quarters, ambassadors came 
<A NAME="560"></A>to him from Arsaces, with this short speech: If the army was sent by the 
<A NAME="561"></A>people of Rome, he denounced mortal war, but if, as he understood was the 
<A NAME="562"></A>case, against the consent of his country, Crassus for his own private profit 
<A NAME="563"></A>had invaded his territory, then their king would be more merciful, and 
<A NAME="564"></A>taking pity upon Crassus's dotage, would send those soldiers back who had 
<A NAME="565"></A>been left not so truly to keep guard on him as to be his prisoners. Crassus 
<A NAME="566"></A>boastfully told them he would return his answer at Seleucia, upon which 
<A NAME="567"></A>Vagises, the eldest of them, laughed and showed the palm of his hand, saying, 
<A NAME="568"></A>"Hair will grow here before you will see Seleucia;" so they returned to 
<A NAME="569"></A>their king, Hyrodes, telling him it was war. Several of the Romans that 
<A NAME="570"></A>were in garrison in Mesopotamia with great hazard made their escape, and 
<A NAME="571"></A>brought word that the danger was worth consideration, urging their own 
<A NAME="572"></A>eye-witness of the numbers of the enemy, and the manner of their fighting, 
<A NAME="573"></A>when they assaulted their towns; and, as men's manner is, made all seem 
<A NAME="574"></A>greater than really it was. By flight it was impossible to escape them, 
<A NAME="575"></A>and as impossible to overtake them when they fled, and they had a new and 
<A NAME="576"></A>strange sort of darts, as swift as sight, for they pierced whatever they 
<A NAME="577"></A>met with, before you could see who threw them; their men-at-arms were so 
<A NAME="578"></A>provided that their weapons would cut through anything, and their armour 
<A NAME="579"></A>give way to nothing. All which when the soldiers heard their hearts failed 
<A NAME="580"></A>them; for till now they thought there was no difference between the Parthians 
<A NAME="581"></A>and the Armenians or Cappadocians, whom Lucullus grew weary with plundering, 
<A NAME="582"></A>and had been persuaded that the main difficulty of the war consisted only 
<A NAME="583"></A>in the tediousness of the march and the trouble of chasing men that durst 
<A NAME="584"></A>not come to blows, so that the danger of a battle was beyond their expectation; 
<A NAME="585"></A>accordingly, some of the officers advised Crassus to proceed no further 
<A NAME="586"></A>at present, but reconsider the whole enterprise, amongst whom in particular 
<A NAME="587"></A>was Cassius, the quaestor. The soothsayers, also, told him privately the 
<A NAME="588"></A>signs found in the sacrifices were continually adverse and unfavourable. 
<A NAME="589"></A>But he paid no heed to them, or to anybody who gave any other advice than 
<A NAME="590"></A>to proceed. Nor did Artabazes, King of Armenia, confirm him a little, who 
<A NAME="591"></A>came to his aid with six thousand horse; who, however, were said to be 
<A NAME="592"></A>only the king's life-guard and suit, for he promised ten thousand cuirassiers 
<A NAME="593"></A>more, and thirty thousand foot, at his own charge. He urged Crassus to 
<A NAME="594"></A>invade Parthia by the way of Armenia, for not only would he be able there 
<A NAME="595"></A>to supply his army with abundant provision, which he would give him, but 
<A NAME="596"></A>his passage would be more secure in the mountains and hills, with which 
<A NAME="597"></A>the whole country was covered, making it almost impassable to horse, in 
<A NAME="598"></A>which the main strength of the Parthians consisted. Crassus returned him 
<A NAME="599"></A>but cold thanks for his readiness to serve him, and for the splendour of 
<A NAME="600"></A>his assistance, and told him he was resolved to pass through Mesopotamia, 
<A NAME="601"></A>where he had left a great many brave Roman soldiers; whereupon the Armenian 
<A NAME="602"></A>went his way. As Crassus was taking the army over the river at Zeugma, 
<A NAME="603"></A>he encountered preternaturally violent thunder, and the lightning flashed 
<A NAME="604"></A>in the faces of the troops, and during the storm a hurricane broke upon 
<A NAME="605"></A>the bridge, and carried part of it away; two thunderbolts fell upon the 
<A NAME="606"></A>very place where the army was going to encamp; and one of the general's 
<A NAME="607"></A>horses, magnificently caparisoned, dragged away the groom into the river 
<A NAME="608"></A>and was drowned. It is said, too, that when they went to take up the first 
<A NAME="609"></A>standard, the eagle of itself turned its head backward; and after he had 
<A NAME="610"></A>passed over his army, as they were distributing provisions, the first thing 
<A NAME="611"></A>they gave was lentils and salt, which with the Romans are the food proper 
<A NAME="612"></A>to funerals, and are offered to the dead. And as Crassus was haranguing 
<A NAME="613"></A>his soldiers, he let fall a word which was thought very ominous in the 
<A NAME="614"></A>army; for "I am going," he said, "to break down the bridge, that none of 
<A NAME="615"></A>you may return;" and whereas he ought, when he had perceived his blunder, 
<A NAME="616"></A>to have corrected himself, and explained his meaning, seeing the men alarmed 
<A NAME="617"></A>at the expression, he would not do it out of mere stubbornness. And when 
<A NAME="618"></A>at the last general sacrifice the priest gave him the entrails, they slipped 
<A NAME="619"></A>out of his hand, and when he saw the standers-by concerned at it, he laughed 
<A NAME="620"></A>and said, "See what it is to be an old man; but I shall hold my sword fast 
<A NAME="621"></A>enough."
<A NAME="622"></A><BR><BR>So he marched his army along the river with seven legions, little 
<A NAME="623"></A>less than four thousand horse, and as many light-armed soldiers, and the 
<A NAME="624"></A>scouts returning declared that not one man appeared, but that they saw 
<A NAME="625"></A>the footing of a great many horses which seemed to be retiring in flight, 
<A NAME="626"></A>whereupon Crassus conceived great hopes, and the Romans began to despise 
<A NAME="627"></A>the Parthians, as men that would not come to combat, hand to hand. But 
<A NAME="628"></A>Cassius spoke with him again, and advised him to refresh his army in some 
<A NAME="629"></A>of the garrison towns, and remain there till they could get some certain 
<A NAME="630"></A>intelligence of the enemy, or at least to make toward Seleucia, and keep 
<A NAME="631"></A>by the river, that so they might have the convenience of having provision 
<A NAME="632"></A>constantly supplied by the boats, which might always accompany the army, 
<A NAME="633"></A>and the river would secure them from being environed, and, if they should 
<A NAME="634"></A>fight, it might be upon equal terms.
<A NAME="635"></A><BR><BR>While Crassus was still considering, and as yet undetermined, there 
<A NAME="636"></A>came to the camp an Arab chief named Ariamnes, a cunning and wily fellow, 
<A NAME="637"></A>who, of all the evil chances which combined to lead them on to destruction, 
<A NAME="638"></A>was the chief and the most fatal. Some of Pompey's old soldiers knew him, 
<A NAME="639"></A>and remembered him to have received some kindnesses of Pompey, and to have 
<A NAME="640"></A>been looked upon as a friend to the Romans, but he was now suborned by 
<A NAME="641"></A>the king's generals, and sent to Crassus to entice him if possible from 
<A NAME="642"></A>the river and hills into the wide open plain, where he might be surrounded. 
<A NAME="643"></A>For the Parthians desired anything rather than to be obliged to meet the 
<A NAME="644"></A>Romans face to face. He, therefore, coming to Crassus (and he had a persuasive 
<A NAME="645"></A>tongue), highly commended Pompey as his benefactor, and admired the forces 
<A NAME="646"></A>that Crassus had with him, but seemed to wonder why he delayed and made 
<A NAME="647"></A>preparations, as if he should not use his feet more than any arms, against 
<A NAME="648"></A>men that, taking with them their best goods and chattels, had designed 
<A NAME="649"></A>long ago to fly for refuge to the Scythians or Hyrcanians. "If you meant 
<A NAME="650"></A>to fight, you should have made all possible haste, before the king should 
<A NAME="651"></A>recover courage, and collect his forces together; at present you see Surena 
<A NAME="652"></A>and Sillaces opposed to you, to draw you off in pursuit of them, while 
<A NAME="653"></A>the king himself keeps out of the way." But this was all a lie, for Hyrodes 
<A NAME="654"></A>had divided his army in two parts; with one he in person wasted Armenia, 
<A NAME="655"></A>revenging himself upon Artavasdes, and sent Surena against the Romans, 
<A NAME="656"></A>not out of contempt, as some pretend, for there is no likelihood that he 
<A NAME="657"></A>should despise Crassus, one of the chiefest men of Rome, to go and fight 
<A NAME="658"></A>with Artavasdes, and invade Armenia; but much more probably he really apprehended 
<A NAME="659"></A>the danger, and therefore waited to see the event, intending that Surena 
<A NAME="660"></A>should first run the hazard of a battle, and draw the enemy on. Nor was 
<A NAME="661"></A>this Surena an ordinary person, but in wealth, family, and reputation, 
<A NAME="662"></A>the second man in the kingdom, and in courage and prowess the first, and 
<A NAME="663"></A>for bodily stature and beauty no man like him. Whenever he travelled privately, 
<A NAME="664"></A>he had one thousand camels to carry his baggage, two hundred chariots for 
<A NAME="665"></A>his concubines, one thousand completely armed men for life-guards, and 
<A NAME="666"></A>a great many more light-armed; and he had at least ten thousand horsemen 
<A NAME="667"></A>altogether, of his servants and retinue. The honour had long belonged to 
<A NAME="668"></A>his family, that at the king's coronation he put the crown upon his head, 
<A NAME="669"></A>and when this very king Hyrodes had been exiled, he brought him in; it 
<A NAME="670"></A>was he, also, that took the great city of Seleucia, was the first man that 
<A NAME="671"></A>scaled the walls, and with his own hand beat off the defenders. And though 
<A NAME="672"></A>at this time he was not above thirty years old, he had a great name for 
<A NAME="673"></A>wisdom and sagacity, and, indeed, by these qualities chiefly, he overthrew 
<A NAME="674"></A>Crassus, who first through his overweening confidence, and afterwards because 
<A NAME="675"></A>he was cowed by his calamities, fell a ready victim to his subtlety. When 
<A NAME="676"></A>Ariamnes had thus worked upon him, he drew him from the river into vast 
<A NAME="677"></A>plains, by a way that at first was pleasant and easy but afterwards very 
<A NAME="678"></A>troublesome by reason of the depth of the sand; no tree, nor any water, 
<A NAME="679"></A>and no end of this to be seen; so that they were not only spent with thirst, 
<A NAME="680"></A>and the difficulty of the passage, but were dismayed with the uncomfortable 
<A NAME="681"></A>prospect of not a bough, not a stream, not a hillock, not a green herb, 
<A NAME="682"></A>but in fact a sea of sand, which encompassed the army with its waves. They 
<A NAME="683"></A>began to suspect some treachery, and at the same time came messengers from 
<A NAME="684"></A>Artavasdes, that he was fiercely attacked by Hyrodes, who had invaded his 
<A NAME="685"></A>country, so that now it was impossible for him to send any succours, and 
<A NAME="686"></A>that he therefore advised Crassus to turn back, and with joint forces to 
<A NAME="687"></A>give Hyrodes battle, or at least that he should march and encamp where 
<A NAME="688"></A>horses could not easily come, and keep to the mountains. Crassus, out of 
<A NAME="689"></A>anger and perverseness, wrote him no answer, but told them, at present 
<A NAME="690"></A>he was not at leisure to mind the Armenians, but he would call upon them 
<A NAME="691"></A>another time, and revenge himself upon Artavasdes for his treachery. Cassius 
<A NAME="692"></A>and his friends began again to complain, but when they perceived that it 
<A NAME="693"></A>merely displeased Crassus, they gave over, but privately railed at the 
<A NAME="694"></A>barbarian, "What evil genius, O thou worst of men, brought thee to our 
<A NAME="695"></A>camp, and with what charms and potions hast thou bewitched Crassus, that 
<A NAME="696"></A>he should march his army through a vast and deep desert, through ways which 
<A NAME="697"></A>are rather fit for a captain of Arabian robbers, than for the general of 
<A NAME="698"></A>a Roman army?" But the barbarian, being a wily fellow, very submissively 
<A NAME="699"></A>exhorted them, and encouraged them to sustain it a little further, and 
<A NAME="700"></A>ran about the camp, and professing to cheer up the soldiers, asked them, 
<A NAME="701"></A>jokingly, "What, do you think you march through Campania, expecting everywhere 
<A NAME="702"></A>to find springs, and shady trees, and baths, and inns of entertainment? 
<A NAME="703"></A>Consider you now travel through the confines of Arabia and Assyria." Thus 
<A NAME="704"></A>he managed them like children, and before the cheat was discovered, he 
<A NAME="705"></A>rode away; not but that Crassus was aware of his going, but he had persuaded 
<A NAME="706"></A>him that he would go and contrive how to disorder the affairs of the 
<A NAME="707"></A>enemy.
<A NAME="708"></A><BR><BR>It is related that Crassus came abroad that day not in his scarlet 
<A NAME="709"></A>robe, which Roman generals usually wear, but in a black one, which, as 
<A NAME="710"></A>soon as he perceived, he changed. And the standard-bearers had much ado 
<A NAME="711"></A>to take up their eagles, which seemed to be fixed to the place. Crassus 
<A NAME="712"></A>laughed at it, and hastened their march, and compelled his infantry to 
<A NAME="713"></A>keep pace with his cavalry, till some few of the scouts returned and told 
<A NAME="714"></A>them that their fellows were slain and they hardly escaped, that the enemy 
<A NAME="715"></A>was at hand in full force, and resolved to give them battle. On this all 
<A NAME="716"></A>was in an uproar; Crassus was struck with amazement, and for haste could 
<A NAME="717"></A>scarcely put his army in good order. First, as Cassius advised, he opened 
<A NAME="718"></A>their ranks and files that they might take up as much space as could be, 
<A NAME="719"></A>to prevent their being surrounded, and distributed the horse upon the wings, 
<A NAME="720"></A>but afterwards changing his mind, he drew up his army in a square, and 
<A NAME="721"></A>made a front every way, each of which consisted of twelve cohorts, to every 
<A NAME="722"></A>one of which he allotted a troop of horse, that no part might be destitute 
<A NAME="723"></A>of the assistance that the horse might give, and that they might be ready 
<A NAME="724"></A>to assist everywhere, as need should require. Cassius commanded one of 
<A NAME="725"></A>the wings, young Crassus the other, and he himself was in the middle. Thus 
<A NAME="726"></A>they marched on till they came to a little river named Balissus, a very 
<A NAME="727"></A>inconsiderable one in itself, but very grateful to the soldiers, who had 
<A NAME="728"></A>suffered so much by drouth and heat all along their march. Most of the 
<A NAME="729"></A>commanders were of the opinion that they ought to remain there that night, 
<A NAME="730"></A>and to inform themselves as much as possible of the number of the enemies, 
<A NAME="731"></A>and their order, and so march against them at break of day; but Crassus 
<A NAME="732"></A>was so carried away by the eagerness of his son, and the horsemen that 
<A NAME="733"></A>were with him, who desired and urged him to lead them on and engage, that 
<A NAME="734"></A>he commanded those that had a mind to it to eat and drink as they stood 
<A NAME="735"></A>in their ranks, and before they had all well done, he led them on, not 
<A NAME="736"></A>leisurely and with halts to take breath, as if he was going to battle, 
<A NAME="737"></A>but kept on his pace as if he had been in haste, till they saw the enemy, 
<A NAME="738"></A>contrary to their expectation, neither so many nor so magnificently armed 
<A NAME="739"></A>as the Romans expected. For Surena had hid his main force behind the first 
<A NAME="740"></A>ranks, and ordered them to hide the glittering of their armour with coats 
<A NAME="741"></A>and skins. But when they approached and the general gave the signal, immediately 
<A NAME="742"></A>all the field rung with a hideous noise and terrible clamour. For the Parthians 
<A NAME="743"></A>do not encourage themselves to war with cornets and trumpets, but with 
<A NAME="744"></A>a kind of kettle-drum, which they strike all at once in various quarters. 
<A NAME="745"></A>With these they make a dead, hollow noise, like the bellowing of beasts, 
<A NAME="746"></A>mixed with sounds resembling thunder, having, it would seem, very correctly 
<A NAME="747"></A>observed that of all our senses hearing most confounds and disorders us, 
<A NAME="748"></A>and that the feelings excited through it most quickly disturb and most 
<A NAME="749"></A>entirely overpower the understanding.
<A NAME="750"></A><BR><BR>When they had sufficiently terrified the Romans with their noise, 
<A NAME="751"></A>they threw off the covering of their armour, and shone like lightning in 
<A NAME="752"></A>their breastplates and helmets of polished Margianian steel, and with their 
<A NAME="753"></A>horses covered with brass and steel trappings. Surena was the tallest and 
<A NAME="754"></A>finest looking man himself, but the delicacy of his looks and effeminacy 
<A NAME="755"></A>of his dress did not promise so much manhood as he really was master of; 
<A NAME="756"></A>for his face was painted, and his hair parted after the fashion of the 
<A NAME="757"></A>Medes, whereas the other Parthians made a more terrible appearance, with 
<A NAME="758"></A>their shaggy hair gathered in a mass upon their foreheads after the Scythian 
<A NAME="759"></A>mode. Their first design was with their lances to beat down and force back 
<A NAME="760"></A>the first ranks of the Romans, but when they perceived the depth of their 
<A NAME="761"></A>battle, and that the soldiers firmly kept their ground, they made a retreat, 
<A NAME="762"></A>and pretending to break their order and disperse, they encompassed the 
<A NAME="763"></A>Roman square before they were aware of it. Crassus commanded his light-armed 
<A NAME="764"></A>soldiers to charge, but they had not gone far before they were received 
<A NAME="765"></A>with such a shower of arrows that they were glad to retire amongst the 
<A NAME="766"></A>heavy-armed, with whom this was the first occasion of disorder and terror, 
<A NAME="767"></A>when they perceived the strength and force of their darts, which pierced 
<A NAME="768"></A>their arms, and passed through every kind of covering, hard and soft alike. 
<A NAME="769"></A>The Parthians now placing themselves at distances began to shoot from all 
<A NAME="770"></A>sides, not aiming at any particular mark (for, indeed, the order of the 
<A NAME="771"></A>Romans was so close, that they could not miss if they would), but simply 
<A NAME="772"></A>sent their arrows with great force out of strong bent bows, the strokes 
<A NAME="773"></A>from which came with extreme violence. The position of the Romans was a 
<A NAME="774"></A>very bad one from the first; for if they kept their ranks, they were wounded, 
<A NAME="775"></A>and if they tried to charge, they hurt the enemy none the more, and themselves 
<A NAME="776"></A>suffered none the less. For the Parthians threw their darts as they fled, 
<A NAME="777"></A>an art in which none but the Scythians excel them, and it is, indeed, a 
<A NAME="778"></A>cunning practice, for while they thus fight to make their escape, they 
<A NAME="779"></A>avoid the dishonour of a flight.
<A NAME="780"></A><BR><BR>However, the Romans had some comfort to think that when they had 
<A NAME="781"></A>spent all their arrows, they would either give over or come to blows but 
<A NAME="782"></A>when they presently understood that there were numerous camels loaded with 
<A NAME="783"></A>arrows, and that when the first ranks had discharged those they had, they 
<A NAME="784"></A>wheeled off and took more, Crassus seeing no end of it, was out of all 
<A NAME="785"></A>heart, and sent to his son that he should endeavour to fall in upon them 
<A NAME="786"></A>before he was quite surrounded; for the enemy advanced most upon that quarter, 
<A NAME="787"></A>and seemed to be trying to ride around and come upon the rear. Therefore 
<A NAME="788"></A>the young man, taking with him thirteen hundred horse, one thousand of 
<A NAME="789"></A>which he had from Caesar, five hundred archers, and eight cohorts of the 
<A NAME="790"></A>full-armed soldiers that stood next him, led them up with design to charge 
<A NAME="791"></A>the Parthians. Whether it was that they found themselves in a piece of 
<A NAME="792"></A>marshy ground, as some think, or else designing to entice young Crassus 
<A NAME="793"></A>as far as they could from his father, they turned and began to fly whereupon 
<A NAME="794"></A>he crying out that they durst not stand, pursued them, and with him Censorinus 
<A NAME="795"></A>and Megabacchus, both famous, the latter for his courage and prowess, the 
<A NAME="796"></A>other for being of a senator's family, and an excellent orator, both intimates 
<A NAME="797"></A>of Crassus, and of about the same age. The horse thus pushing on, the infantry 
<A NAME="798"></A>stayed a little behind, being exalted with hopes and joy, for they supposed 
<A NAME="799"></A>they had already conquered, and now were only pursuing; till when they 
<A NAME="800"></A>were gone too far, they perceived the deceit, for they that seemed to fly 
<A NAME="801"></A>now turned again, and a great many fresh ones came on. Upon this they made 
<A NAME="802"></A>a halt, for they doubted not but now the enemy would attack them, because 
<A NAME="803"></A>they were so few. But they merely placed their cuirassiers to face the 
<A NAME="804"></A>Romans, and with the rest of their horse rode about scouring the field, 
<A NAME="805"></A>and thus stirring up the sand, they raised such a dust that the Romans 
<A NAME="806"></A>could neither see nor speak to one another, and being driven in upon one 
<A NAME="807"></A>another in one close body, they were thus hit and killed, dying, not by 
<A NAME="808"></A>a quick and easy death, but with miserable pains and convulsions; for writhing 
<A NAME="809"></A>upon the darts in their bodies, they broke them in their wounds, and when 
<A NAME="810"></A>they would by force pluck out the barbed points, they caught the nerves 
<A NAME="811"></A>and veins, so that they tore and tortured themselves. Many of them died 
<A NAME="812"></A>thus, and those that survived were disabled for any service, and when Publius 
<A NAME="813"></A>exhorted them to charge the cuirassiers, they showed him their hands nailed 
<A NAME="814"></A>to their shields, and their feet stuck to the ground, so that they could 
<A NAME="815"></A>neither fly nor fight. He charged in himself boldly, however, with his 
<A NAME="816"></A>horse, and came to close quarters with them, but was very unequal, whether 
<A NAME="817"></A>as to the offensive or defensive part; for with his weak and little javelins, 
<A NAME="818"></A>he struck against targets that were of tough raw hides and iron, whereas, 
<A NAME="819"></A>the lightly-clad bodies of his Gaulish horsemen were exposed to the strong 
<A NAME="820"></A>spears of the enemy. For upon these he mostly depended, and with them he 
<A NAME="821"></A>wrought wonders; for they would catch hold of the great spears, and close 
<A NAME="822"></A>upon the enemy, and so pull them off from their horses, where they could 
<A NAME="823"></A>scarce stir by reason of the heaviness of their armour, and many of the 
<A NAME="824"></A>Gauls quitting their own horses, would creep under those of the enemy, 
<A NAME="825"></A>and stick them in the belly; which, growing unruly with the pain, trampled 
<A NAME="826"></A>upon their riders and upon the enemies promiscuously. The Gauls were chiefly 
<A NAME="827"></A>tormented by the heat and drouth, being not accustomed to either, and most 
<A NAME="828"></A>of their horses were slain by being spurred on against the spears, so that 
<A NAME="829"></A>they were forced to retire among the foot, bearing off Publius grievously 
<A NAME="830"></A>wounded. Observing a sandy hillock not far off, they made to it, and tying 
<A NAME="831"></A>their horses to one another, and placing them in the midst, and joining 
<A NAME="832"></A>all their shields together before them, they thought they might make some 
<A NAME="833"></A>defence against the barbarians. But it fell out quite contrary, for when 
<A NAME="834"></A>they were drawn up in a plain, the front in some measure secured those 
<A NAME="835"></A>that were behind; but when they were upon the hill, one being of necessity 
<A NAME="836"></A>higher up than another, none were in shelter, but all alike stood equally 
<A NAME="837"></A>exposed, bewailing their inglorious and useless fate. There were with Publius 
<A NAME="838"></A>two Greeks that lived near there at Carrhae, Hieronymus and Nicomachus; 
<A NAME="839"></A>these men urged him to retire with them and fly to Ichnae, a town not far 
<A NAME="840"></A>from thence, and friendly to the Romans. "No," said he, "there is no death 
<A NAME="841"></A>so terrible, for the fear of which Publius would leave his friends that 
<A NAME="842"></A>die upon his account;" and bidding them to take care of themselves, he 
<A NAME="843"></A>embraced them and sent them away, and, because he could not use his arm, 
<A NAME="844"></A>for he was run through with a dart, he opened his side to his armour-bearer, 
<A NAME="845"></A>and commanded him to run him through. It is said Censorinus fell in the 
<A NAME="846"></A>same manner. Megabacchus slew himself, as did also the rest of best note. 
<A NAME="847"></A>The Parthians coming upon the rest with their lances, killed them fighting, 
<A NAME="848"></A>nor were there above five hundred taken prisoners. Cutting off the head 
<A NAME="849"></A>of Publius, they rode off directly towards Crassus.
<A NAME="850"></A><BR><BR>His condition was thus. When he had commanded his son to fall upon 
<A NAME="851"></A>the enemy, and word was brought him that they fled and that there was a 
<A NAME="852"></A>distant pursuit, and perceiving also that the enemy did not press upon 
<A NAME="853"></A>him so hard as formerly, for they were mostly gone to fall upon Publius, 
<A NAME="854"></A>he began to take heart a little; and drawing his army towards some sloping 
<A NAME="855"></A>ground, expected when his son would return from the pursuit. Of the messengers 
<A NAME="856"></A>whom Publius sent to him (as soon as he saw his danger), the first were 
<A NAME="857"></A>intercepted by the enemy, and slain; the last, hardly escaping, came and 
<A NAME="858"></A>declared that Publius was lost, unless he had speedy succours. Crassus 
<A NAME="859"></A>was terribly distracted, not knowing what counsel to take, and indeed no 
<A NAME="860"></A>longer capable of taking any; overpowered now by fear for the whole army, 
<A NAME="861"></A>now by desire to help his son. At last he resolved to move with his forces. 
<A NAME="862"></A>Just upon this, up came the enemy with their shouts and noises more terrible 
<A NAME="863"></A>than before, their drums sounding again in the ears of the Romans, who 
<A NAME="864"></A>now feared a fresh engagement. And they who brought Publius's head upon 
<A NAME="865"></A>the point of a spear, riding up near enough that it could be known, scoffingly 
<A NAME="866"></A>inquired where were his parents, and what family he was of, for it was 
<A NAME="867"></A>impossible that so brave and gallant a warrior should be the son of so 
<A NAME="868"></A>pitiful a coward as Crassus. This sight above all the rest dismayed the 
<A NAME="869"></A>Romans, for it did not incite them to anger as it might have done, but 
<A NAME="870"></A>to horror and trembling, though they say Crassus outdid himself in this 
<A NAME="871"></A>calamity, for he passed through the ranks and cried out to them, "This, 
<A NAME="872"></A>O my countrymen, is my own peculiar loss, but the fortune and the glory 
<A NAME="873"></A>of Rome is safe and untainted so long as you are safe. But if any one be 
<A NAME="874"></A>concerned for my loss of the best of sons, let him show it in revenging 
<A NAME="875"></A>him upon the enemy. Take away their joy, revenge their cruelty, nor be 
<A NAME="876"></A>dismayed at what is past; for whoever tries for great objects must suffer 
<A NAME="877"></A>something. Neither did Lucullus overthrow Tigranes without bloodshed, nor 
<A NAME="878"></A>Scipio Antiochus; our ancestors lost one thousand ships about Sicily, and 
<A NAME="879"></A>how many generals and captains in Italy? no one of which losses hindered 
<A NAME="880"></A>them from overthrowing their conquerors; for the State of Rome did not 
<A NAME="881"></A>arrive to this height by fortune, but by perseverance and virtue in confronting 
<A NAME="882"></A>danger."
<A NAME="883"></A><BR><BR>While Crassus thus spoke exhorting them, he saw but few that gave 
<A NAME="884"></A>much heed to him, and when he ordered them to shout for battle, he could 
<A NAME="885"></A>no longer mistake the despondency of his army, which made but a faint and 
<A NAME="886"></A>unsteady noise, while the shout of the enemy was clear and bold. And when 
<A NAME="887"></A>they came to the business, the Parthian servants and dependents riding 
<A NAME="888"></A>about shot their arrows, and the horsemen in the foremost ranks with their 
<A NAME="889"></A>spears drove the Romans close together, except those who rushed upon them 
<A NAME="890"></A>for fear of being killed by their arrows. Neither did these do much execution, 
<A NAME="891"></A>being quickly despatched; for the strong, thick spear made large and mortal 
<A NAME="892"></A>wounds, and often run through two men at once. As they were thus fighting, 
<A NAME="893"></A>the night coming on parted them, the Parthians boasting that they would 
<A NAME="894"></A>indulge Crassus with one night to mourn his son, unless upon better consideration 
<A NAME="895"></A>he would rather go to Arsaces than be carried to him. These, therefore, 
<A NAME="896"></A>took up their quarters near them, being flushed with their victory. But 
<A NAME="897"></A>the Romans had a sad night of it; for neither taking care for the burial 
<A NAME="898"></A>of their dead, nor the cure of the wounded, nor the groans of the expiring, 
<A NAME="899"></A>every one bewailed his own fate. For there was no means of escaping, whether 
<A NAME="900"></A>they should stay for the light, or venture to retreat into the vast desert 
<A NAME="901"></A>in the dark. And now the wounded men have them new trouble, since to take 
<A NAME="902"></A>them with them would retard their flight, and if they should leave them, 
<A NAME="903"></A>they might serve as guides to the enemy by their cries. However, they were 
<A NAME="904"></A>all desirous to see and hear Crassus, though they were sensible that he 
<A NAME="905"></A>was the cause of all their mischief. But he wrapped his cloak around him, 
<A NAME="906"></A>and hid himself, where he lay as an example, to ordinary minds, of the 
<A NAME="907"></A>caprice of fortune, but to the wise, of inconsiderateness and ambition; 
<A NAME="908"></A>who, not content to be superior to so many millions of men, being inferior 
<A NAME="909"></A>to two, esteemed himself as the lowest of all. Then came Octavius, his 
<A NAME="910"></A>lieutenant, and Cassius, to comfort him, but he being altogether past helping, 
<A NAME="911"></A>they themselves called together the centurions and tribunes, and agreeing 
<A NAME="912"></A>that the best way was to fly, they ordered the army out, without sound 
<A NAME="913"></A>of trumpet, and at first with silence. But before long, when the disabled 
<A NAME="914"></A>men found they were left behind, strange confusion and disorder, with an 
<A NAME="915"></A>outcry and lamentation, seized the camp, and a trembling and dread presently 
<A NAME="916"></A>fell upon them, as if the enemy were at their heels. By which means, now 
<A NAME="917"></A>and then turning out of their way, now and then standing to their ranks, 
<A NAME="918"></A>sometimes taking up the wounded that followed, sometimes laying them down, 
<A NAME="919"></A>they wasted the time, except three hundred horse, whom Egnatius brought 
<A NAME="920"></A>safe to Carrhae about midnight; where calling, in the Roman tongue, to 
<A NAME="921"></A>the watch, as soon as they heard him, he bade them tell Coponius, the governor, 
<A NAME="922"></A>that Crassus had fought a very great battle with the Parthians; and having 
<A NAME="923"></A>said but this, and not so much as telling his name, he rode away at full 
<A NAME="924"></A>speed to Zeugma. And by this means he saved himself and his men, but lost 
<A NAME="925"></A>his reputation by deserting his general. However, his message to Coponius 
<A NAME="926"></A>was for the advantage of Crassus; for he, suspecting by this hasty and 
<A NAME="927"></A>confused delivery of the message that all was not well, immediately ordered 
<A NAME="928"></A>the garrison to be in arms, and as soon as he understood that Crassus was 
<A NAME="929"></A>upon the way towards him, he went out to meet him, and received him with 
<A NAME="930"></A>his army into the town.
<A NAME="931"></A><BR><BR>The Parthians, although they perceived their dislodgment in the 
<A NAME="932"></A>night, yet did not pursue them, but as soon as it was day, they came upon 
<A NAME="933"></A>those that were left in the camp, and put no less than four thousand to 
<A NAME="934"></A>the sword and with their light horse picked up a great many stragglers. 
<A NAME="935"></A>Varguntinus, the lieutenant, while it was yet dark, had broken off from 
<A NAME="936"></A>the main body with four cohorts which had strayed out of the way; and the 
<A NAME="937"></A>Parthians encompassing these on a small hill, slew every man of them excepting 
<A NAME="938"></A>twenty, who with their drawn swords forced their way through the thickest, 
<A NAME="939"></A>and they admiring their courage, opened their ranks to the right and left, 
<A NAME="940"></A>and let them pass without molestation to Carrhae.
<A NAME="941"></A><BR><BR>Soon after a false report was brought to Surena, that Crassus, 
<A NAME="942"></A>with his principal officers, had escaped, and that those who were got into 
<A NAME="943"></A>Carrhae were but a confused rout of insignificant people, not worth further 
<A NAME="944"></A>pursuit. Supposing, therefore, that he had lost the very crown and glory 
<A NAME="945"></A>of his victory, and yet being uncertain whether it were so or not, and 
<A NAME="946"></A>anxious to ascertain the fact, that so he should either stay and besiege 
<A NAME="947"></A>Carrhae or follow Crassus, he sent one of his interpreters to the walls, 
<A NAME="948"></A>commanding him in Latin to call for Crassus or Cassius, for that the general, 
<A NAME="949"></A>Surena, desired a conference. As soon as Crassus heard this, he embraced 
<A NAME="950"></A>the proposal, and soon after there came up a band of Arabians, who very 
<A NAME="951"></A>well knew the faces of Crassus and Cassius, as having been frequently in 
<A NAME="952"></A>the Roman camp before the battle. They having espied Cassius from the wall, 
<A NAME="953"></A>told him that Surena desired a peace, and would give them safe convoy, 
<A NAME="954"></A>if they would make a treaty with the king his master, and withdraw all 
<A NAME="955"></A>their troops out of Mesopotamia; and this he thought most advisable for 
<A NAME="956"></A>them both, before things came to the last extremity; Cassius, embracing 
<A NAME="957"></A>the proposal, desired that a time and place might be appointed where Crassus 
<A NAME="958"></A>and Surena might have an interview. The Arabians, having charged themselves 
<A NAME="959"></A>with the message, went back to Surena, who was not a little rejoiced that 
<A NAME="960"></A>Crassus was there to be besieged.
<A NAME="961"></A><BR><BR>Next day, therefore, he came up with his army, insulting over the 
<A NAME="962"></A>Romans, and haughtily demanded of them Crassus and Cassius, bound, if they 
<A NAME="963"></A>expected any mercy. The Romans, seeing themselves deluded and mocked, were 
<A NAME="964"></A>much troubled at it, but advising Crassus to lay aside his distant and 
<A NAME="965"></A>empty hopes of aid from the Armenians, resolved to fly for it; and this 
<A NAME="966"></A>design ought to have been kept private, till they were upon their way, 
<A NAME="967"></A>and not have been told to any of the people of Carrhae. But Crassus let 
<A NAME="968"></A>this also be known to Andromachus, the most faithless of men, nay, he was 
<A NAME="969"></A>so infatuated as to choose him for his guide. The Parthians then, to be 
<A NAME="970"></A>sure, had punctual intelligence of all that passed; but it being contrary 
<A NAME="971"></A>to their usage, and also difficult for them to fight by night, and Crassus 
<A NAME="972"></A>having chosen that time to set out, Andromachus, lest he should get the 
<A NAME="973"></A>start too far of his pursuers, led him hither and thither, and at last 
<A NAME="974"></A>conveyed him into the midst of morasses and places full of ditches, so 
<A NAME="975"></A>that the Romans had a troublesome and perplexing journey of it, and some 
<A NAME="976"></A>were who, supposing by these windings and turnings of Andromachus that 
<A NAME="977"></A>no good was intended, resolved to follow him no further. And at last Cassius 
<A NAME="978"></A>himself returned to Carrhae, and his guides, the Arabians, advising him 
<A NAME="979"></A>to tarry there till the moon was got out of Scorpio, he told them that 
<A NAME="980"></A>he was most afraid of Sagittarius, and so with five hundred horse went 
<A NAME="981"></A>off to Syria. Others there were who, having got honest guides, took their 
<A NAME="982"></A>way by the mountains called Sinnaca, and got into places of security by 
<A NAME="983"></A>daybreak; these were five thousand under the command of Octavius, a very 
<A NAME="984"></A>gallant man. But Crassus fared worse; day overtook him still deceived by 
<A NAME="985"></A>Andromachus, and entangled in the fens and the difficult country. There 
<A NAME="986"></A>were with him four cohorts of legionary soldiers, a very few horsemen, 
<A NAME="987"></A>and five lictors, with whom having with great difficulty got into the way, 
<A NAME="988"></A>and not being a mile and a half from Octavius, instead of going to join 
<A NAME="989"></A>him, although the enemy were already upon him, he retreated to another 
<A NAME="990"></A>hill, neither so defensible nor impassable for the horse, but lying under 
<A NAME="991"></A>the hills at Sinnaca, and continued so as to join them in a long ridge 
<A NAME="992"></A>through the plain. Octavius could see in what danger the general was, and 
<A NAME="993"></A>himself, at first but slenderly followed, hurried to the rescue. Soon after, 
<A NAME="994"></A>the rest, upbraiding one another with baseness in forsaking their officers, 
<A NAME="995"></A>marched down, and falling upon the Parthians, drove them from the hill, 
<A NAME="996"></A>and compassing Crassus about, and fencing him with their shields, declared 
<A NAME="997"></A>proudly, that no arrow in Parthia should ever touch their general, so long 
<A NAME="998"></A>as there was a man of them left alive to protect him.
<A NAME="999"></A><BR><BR>Surena, therefore, perceiving his soldiers less inclined to expose 
<A NAME="1000"></A>themselves, and knowing that if the Romans should prolong the battle till 
<A NAME="1001"></A>night, they might then gain the mountains and be out of his reach, betook 
<A NAME="1002"></A>himself to his usual craft. Some of the prisoners were set free, who had, 
<A NAME="1003"></A>as it was contrived, been in hearing, while some of the barbarians spoke 
<A NAME="1004"></A>a set purpose in the camp to the effect that the king did not design the 
<A NAME="1005"></A>war to be pursued to extremity against the Romans, but rather desired, 
<A NAME="1006"></A>by his general treatment of Crassus, to make a step towards reconciliation. 
<A NAME="1007"></A>And the barbarians desisted from fighting, and Surena himself, with his 
<A NAME="1008"></A>chief officers, riding gently to the hill, unbent his bow and held out 
<A NAME="1009"></A>his hand, inviting Crassus to an agreement, and saying that it was beside 
<A NAME="1010"></A>the king's intentions, that they had thus had experience of the courage 
<A NAME="1011"></A>and the strength of his soldiers; that now he desired no other contention 
<A NAME="1012"></A>but that of kindness and friendship, by making a truce, and permitting 
<A NAME="1013"></A>them to go away in safety. These words of Surena the rest received joyfully, 
<A NAME="1014"></A>and were eager to accept the offer, but Crassus, who had sufficient experience 
<A NAME="1015"></A>of their perfidiousness, and was unable to see any reason for the sudden 
<A NAME="1016"></A>change, would give no ear to them, and only took time to consider. But 
<A NAME="1017"></A>the soldiers cried out and advised him to treat, and then went on to upbraid 
<A NAME="1018"></A>and affront him, saying that it was very unreasonable that he should bring 
<A NAME="1019"></A>them to fight with such men armed, whom himself, without their arms, durst 
<A NAME="1020"></A>not look in the face. He tried first to prevail with them by entreaties, 
<A NAME="1021"></A>and told them that if they would have patience till evening, they might 
<A NAME="1022"></A>get into the mountains and passes, inaccessible for horse, and be out of 
<A NAME="1023"></A>danger, and withal he pointed out the way with his hand, entreating them 
<A NAME="1024"></A>not to abandon their preservation, now close before them. But when they 
<A NAME="1025"></A>mutinied and clashed their targets in a threatening manner, he was overpowered 
<A NAME="1026"></A>and forced to go, and only turning about at parting, said, "You, Octavius 
<A NAME="1027"></A>and Petronius, and the rest of the officers who are present, see the necessity 
<A NAME="1028"></A>of going which I lie under, and cannot but be sensible of the indignities 
<A NAME="1029"></A>and violence offered to me. Tell all men when you have escaped, that Crassus 
<A NAME="1030"></A>perished rather by the subtlety of his enemies, than by the disobedience 
<A NAME="1031"></A>of his countrymen."
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR><BR>Octavius, however, would not stay there, but with Petronius went 
<A NAME="1033"></A>down from the hill; as for the lictors, Crassus bade them be gone. The 
<A NAME="1034"></A>first that met him were two half-blood Greeks, who, leaping from their 
<A NAME="1035"></A>horses, made a profound reverence to Crassus, and desired him, in Greek, 
<A NAME="1036"></A>to send some before him, who might see that Surena himself was coming towards 
<A NAME="1037"></A>them, his retinue disarmed, and not having so much as their wearing swords 
<A NAME="1038"></A>along with them. But Crassus answered, that if he had the least concern 
<A NAME="1039"></A>for his life, he would never have intrusted himself in their hands, but 
<A NAME="1040"></A>sent two brothers of the name of Roscius to inquire on what terms and in 
<A NAME="1041"></A>what numbers they should meet. These Surena ordered immediately to be seized, 
<A NAME="1042"></A>and himself with his principal officers came up on horseback, and greeting 
<A NAME="1043"></A>him, said, "How is this, then? A Roman commander is on foot, whilst I and 
<A NAME="1044"></A>my train are mounted." But Crassus replied, that there was no error committed 
<A NAME="1045"></A>on either side, for they both met according to the custom of their own 
<A NAME="1046"></A>country. Surena told him that from that time there was a league between 
<A NAME="1047"></A>the king his master and the Romans, but that Crassus must go with him to 
<A NAME="1048"></A>the river to sign it, "for you Romans," said he, "have not good memories 
<A NAME="1049"></A>for conditions," and so saying, reached out his hand to him. Crassus, therefore, 
<A NAME="1050"></A>gave order that one of his horses should be brought; but Surena told him 
<A NAME="1051"></A>there was no need, "the king, my master, presents you with this;" and immediately 
<A NAME="1052"></A>a horse with a golden bit was brought up to him, and himself was forcibly 
<A NAME="1053"></A>put into the saddle by the grooms, who ran by the side and struck the horse 
<A NAME="1054"></A>to make the more haste. But Octavius running up, got hold of the bridle, 
<A NAME="1055"></A>and soon after one of the officers, Petronius, and the rest of the company 
<A NAME="1056"></A>came up, striving to stop the horse, and pulling back those who on both 
<A NAME="1057"></A>sides of him forced Crassus forward. Thus from pulling and thrusting one 
<A NAME="1058"></A>another, they came to a tumult, and soon after to blows. Octavius, drawing 
<A NAME="1059"></A>his sword, killed a groom of one of the barbarians, and one of them, getting 
<A NAME="1060"></A>behind Octavius, killed him. Petronius was not armed, but being struck 
<A NAME="1061"></A>on the breastplate, fell down from his horse, though without hurt. Crassus 
<A NAME="1062"></A>was killed by a Parthian, called Pomaxathres; others say by a different 
<A NAME="1063"></A>man, and that Pomaxathres only cut off his head and right hand after he 
<A NAME="1064"></A>had fallen. But this is conjecture rather than certain knowledge, for those 
<A NAME="1065"></A>that were by had not leisure to observe particulars, and were either killed 
<A NAME="1066"></A>fighting about Crassus, or ran off at once to get to their comrades on 
<A NAME="1067"></A>the hill. But the Parthians coming up to them, and saying that Crassus 
<A NAME="1068"></A>had the punishment he justly deserved, and that Surena bade the rest come 
<A NAME="1069"></A>down from the hill without fear, some of them came down and surrendered 
<A NAME="1070"></A>themselves, others were scattered
