<A NAME="2"></A>
<BR>(died 365 B.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Among the many remarkable things that are related of Furius Camillus, it 
<A NAME="11"></A>seems singular and strange above all, that he, who continually was in the 
<A NAME="12"></A>highest commands, and obtained the greatest successes, was five times chosen 
<A NAME="13"></A>dictator, triumphed four times, and was styled a second founder of Rome, 
<A NAME="14"></A>yet never was so much as once consul. The reason of which was the state 
<A NAME="15"></A>and temper of the commonwealth at that time; for the people, being at dissension 
<A NAME="16"></A>with the senate, refused to return consuls, but in their stead elected 
<A NAME="17"></A>other magistrates, called military tribunes, who acted, indeed, with full 
<A NAME="18"></A>consular power, but were thought to exercise a less obnoxious amount of 
<A NAME="19"></A>authority, because it was divided among a larger number; for to have the 
<A NAME="20"></A>management of affairs intrusted to the hands of six persons rather than 
<A NAME="21"></A>two was some satisfaction to the opponents of oligarchy. This was the condition 
<A NAME="22"></A>of the times when Camillus was in the height of his actions and glory, 
<A NAME="23"></A>and, although the government in the meantime had often proceeded to consular 
<A NAME="24"></A>elections, yet he could never persuade himself to be consul against the 
<A NAME="25"></A>inclination of the people. In all his other administrations, which were 
<A NAME="26"></A>many and various, he so behaved himself, that, when alone in authority, 
<A NAME="27"></A>he exercised his power as in common, but the honour of all actions redounded 
<A NAME="28"></A>entirely to himself, even when in joint commission with others; the reason 
<A NAME="29"></A>of the former was his moderation in command; of the latter, his great judgment 
<A NAME="30"></A>and wisdom, which gave him without controversy the first 
<A NAME="31"></A>place.
<A NAME="32"></A><BR><BR>The house of the Furii was not, at that time, of any considerable 
<A NAME="33"></A>distinction; he, by his own acts, first raised himself to honour, serving 
<A NAME="34"></A>under Postumius Tubertis, dictator, in the great battle against the Aequians 
<A NAME="35"></A>and Volscians. For riding out from the rest of the army, and in the charge 
<A NAME="36"></A>receiving a wound in his thigh, he for all that did not quit the fight, 
<A NAME="37"></A>but, letting the dart drag in the wound, and engaging with the bravest 
<A NAME="38"></A>of the enemy, put them to flight; for which action, among other rewards 
<A NAME="39"></A>bestowed on him, he was created censor, an office in those days of great 
<A NAME="40"></A>repute and authority. During his censorship one very good act of his is 
<A NAME="41"></A>recorded, that, whereas the wars had made many widows, he obliged such 
<A NAME="42"></A>as had no wives, some by fair persuasion, others by threatening to set 
<A NAME="43"></A>fines on their heads, to take them in marriage; another necessary one, 
<A NAME="44"></A>in causing orphans to be rated, who before were exempted from taxes, the 
<A NAME="45"></A>frequent wars requiring more than ordinary expenses to maintain them. What, 
<A NAME="46"></A>however, pressed them most was the siege of Veii. Some call this people 
<A NAME="47"></A>Veientani. This was the head city of Tuscany, not inferior to Rome, either 
<A NAME="48"></A>in number of arms or multitude of soldiers, insomuch that, presuming on 
<A NAME="49"></A>her wealth and luxury, and priding herself upon her refinement and sumptuousness, 
<A NAME="50"></A>she engaged in many honourable contests with the Romans for glory and empire. 
<A NAME="51"></A>But now they abandoned their former ambitious hopes, having been weakened 
<A NAME="52"></A>by great defeats, so that, having fortified themselves with high and strong 
<A NAME="53"></A>walls, and furnished the city with all sorts of weapons offensive and defensive, 
<A NAME="54"></A>as likewise with corn and all manner of provisions, they cheerfully endured 
<A NAME="55"></A>a siege, which, though tedious to them, was no less troublesome and distressing 
<A NAME="56"></A>to the besiegers. For the Romans, having never been accustomed to stay 
<A NAME="57"></A>away from home except in summer, and for no great length of time, and constantly 
<A NAME="58"></A>to winter at home, were then first compelled by the tribunes to build forts 
<A NAME="59"></A>in the enemy's country, and raising strong works about their camp, to join 
<A NAME="60"></A>winter and summer together. And now, the seventh year of the war drawing 
<A NAME="61"></A>to an end, the commanders began to be suspected as too slow and remiss 
<A NAME="62"></A>in driving on the siege, insomuch that they were discharged and others 
<A NAME="63"></A>chosen for the war, among whom was Camillus, then second time tribune. 
<A NAME="64"></A>But at present he had no hand in the siege, the duties that fell by lot 
<A NAME="65"></A>to him being to make war upon the Faliscans and Capenates, who, taking 
<A NAME="66"></A>advantage of the Romans being occupied on all hands, had carried ravages 
<A NAME="67"></A>into their country, and, through all the Tuscan war, given them much annoyance, 
<A NAME="68"></A>but were now reduced by Camillus, and with great loss shut up within their 
<A NAME="69"></A>walls.
<A NAME="70"></A><BR><BR>And now, in the very heat of the war, a strange phenomenon in the 
<A NAME="71"></A>Alban lake, which, in the absence of any known cause and explanation by 
<A NAME="72"></A>natural reasons, seemed as great a prodigy as the most incredible that 
<A NAME="73"></A>are reported, occasioned great alarm. It was the beginning of autumn, and 
<A NAME="74"></A>the summer now ending had, to all observation, been neither rainy nor much 
<A NAME="75"></A>troubled with southern winds; and many of the lakes, brooks, and springs 
<A NAME="76"></A>of all sorts with which Italy abounds, some were wholly dried up, others 
<A NAME="77"></A>drew very little water with them; all the rivers, as is usual in summer, 
<A NAME="78"></A>ran in a very low and hollow channel. But the Alban lake, that is fed by 
<A NAME="79"></A>no other waters but its own, and is on all sides encircled with fruitful 
<A NAME="80"></A>mountains, without any cause, unless it were divine, began visibly to rise 
<A NAME="81"></A>and swell, increasing to the feet of the mountains, and by degrees reaching 
<A NAME="82"></A>the level of the very tops of them, and all this without any waves or agitation. 
<A NAME="83"></A>At first it was the wonder of shepherds and herdsmen; but when the earth, 
<A NAME="84"></A>which, like a great dam, held up the lake from falling into the lower grounds, 
<A NAME="85"></A>through the quantity and weight of water was broken down, and in a violent 
<A NAME="86"></A>stream it ran through the ploughed fields and plantations to discharge 
<A NAME="87"></A>itself in the sea, it not only struck terror into the Romans, but was thought 
<A NAME="88"></A>by all the inhabitants of Italy to portend some extraordinary event. But 
<A NAME="89"></A>the greatest talk of it was in the camp that besieged Veii, so that in 
<A NAME="90"></A>the town itself, also, the occurrence became known.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR>As in long sieges it commonly happens that parties on both sides 
<A NAME="92"></A>meet often and converse with one another, so it chanced that a Roman had 
<A NAME="93"></A>gained much confidence and familiarity with one of the besieged, a man 
<A NAME="94"></A>versed in ancient prophecies, and of repute for more than ordinary skill 
<A NAME="95"></A>in divination. The Roman, observing, him to be overjoyed at the story of 
<A NAME="96"></A>the lake, and to mock at the siege, told him that this was not the only 
<A NAME="97"></A>prodigy that of late had happened to the Romans; others more wonderful 
<A NAME="98"></A>yet than this had befallen them, which he was willing to communicate to 
<A NAME="99"></A>him, that he might the better provide for his private interests in these 
<A NAME="100"></A>public distempers. The man greedily embraced the proposal, expecting to 
<A NAME="101"></A>hear some wonderful secrets; but when, by little and little, he had led 
<A NAME="102"></A>him on in conversation and insensibly drawn him a good way from the gates 
<A NAME="103"></A>of the city, he snatched him up by the middle, being stronger than he, 
<A NAME="104"></A>and, by the assistance of others that came running from the camp, seized 
<A NAME="105"></A>and delivered him to the commanders. The man, reduced to this necessity, 
<A NAME="106"></A>and sensible now that destiny was not to be avoided, discovered to them 
<A NAME="107"></A>the secret oracles of Veii; that it was not possible the city should be 
<A NAME="108"></A>taken, until the Alban lake, which now broke forth and had found out new 
<A NAME="109"></A>passages, was drawn back from that course, and so diverted that it could 
<A NAME="110"></A>not mingle with the sea. The senate, having heard and satisfied themselves 
<A NAME="111"></A>about the matter, decreed to send to Delphi, to ask counsel of the god. 
<A NAME="112"></A>The messengers were persons of the highest repute, Licinius Cossus, Valerius 
<A NAME="113"></A>Potitus, and Fabius Ambustus; who, having made their voyage by sea and 
<A NAME="114"></A>consulted the god, returned with other answers, particularly that there 
<A NAME="115"></A>had been a neglect of some of their national rites relating to the Latin 
<A NAME="116"></A>feasts; but the Alban water the oracle commanded, if it were possible, 
<A NAME="117"></A>they should keep from the sea, and shut it up in its ancient bounds; but 
<A NAME="118"></A>if that was not to be done, then they should carry it off by ditches and 
<A NAME="119"></A>trenches into the lower grounds, and so dry it up; which message being 
<A NAME="120"></A>delivered, the priests performed what related to the sacrifices, and the 
<A NAME="121"></A>people went to work and turned the water.
<A NAME="122"></A><BR><BR>And now the senate, in the tenth year of the war, taking away all 
<A NAME="123"></A>other commands, created Camillus dictator, who chose Cornelius Scipio for 
<A NAME="124"></A>his general of horse. And in the first place he made vows unto the gods, 
<A NAME="125"></A>that, if they would grant a happy conclusion of the war, he would celebrate 
<A NAME="126"></A>to their honour the great games, and dedicate a temple to the goddess whom 
<A NAME="127"></A>the Romans call Matuta, the Mother, though, from the ceremonies which are 
<A NAME="128"></A>used, one would think she was Leucothea. For they take a servant-maid into 
<A NAME="129"></A>the secret part of the temple, and there cuff her, and drive her out again, 
<A NAME="130"></A>and they embrace their brothers' children in place of their own; and, in 
<A NAME="131"></A>general, the ceremonies of the sacrifice remind one of the nursing of Bacchus 
<A NAME="132"></A>by Ino, and the calamities occasioned by her husband's concubine. Camillus, 
<A NAME="133"></A>having made these vows, marched into the country of the Faliscans, and 
<A NAME="134"></A>in a great battle overthrew them and the Capenates, their confederates; 
<A NAME="135"></A>afterwards he turned to the siege of Veii, and, finding that to take it 
<A NAME="136"></A>by assault would prove a difficult and hazardous attempt, proceeded to 
<A NAME="137"></A>cut mines underground, the earth about the city being easy to break up, 
<A NAME="138"></A>and allowing such depth for the works as would prevent their being discovered 
<A NAME="139"></A>by the enemy. This design going on in a hopeful way, he openly gave assaults 
<A NAME="140"></A>to the enemy, to keep them to the walls, whilst they that worked underground 
<A NAME="141"></A>in the mines were, without being perceived, arrived within the citadel, 
<A NAME="142"></A>close to the temple of Juno, which was the greatest and most honoured in 
<A NAME="143"></A>all the city. It is said that the prince of the Tuscans was at that very 
<A NAME="144"></A>time at sacrifice, and that the priest, after he had looked into the entrails 
<A NAME="145"></A>of the beast, cried out with a loud voice that the gods would give victory 
<A NAME="146"></A>to those that should complete those offerings; and that the Romans who 
<A NAME="147"></A>were in the mines, hearing the words, immediately pulled down the floor, 
<A NAME="148"></A>and, ascending with noise and clashing weapons, frightened away the enemy, 
<A NAME="149"></A>and, snatching up the entrails, carried them to Camillus. But this may 
<A NAME="150"></A>look like a fable. The city, however, being taken by storm, and the soldiers 
<A NAME="151"></A>busied in pillaging and gathering an infinite quantity of riches and spoils, 
<A NAME="152"></A>Camillus, from the high tower, viewing what was done, at first wept for 
<A NAME="153"></A>pity; and when they that were by congratulated his success, he lifted up 
<A NAME="154"></A>his hands to heaven, and broke out into this prayer: "O most mighty Jupiter, 
<A NAME="155"></A>and ye gods that are judges of good and evil actions ye know that not without 
<A NAME="156"></A>just cause, but constrained by necessity, we have been forced to revenge 
<A NAME="157"></A>ourselves on the city of our unrighteous and wicked enemies. But if, in 
<A NAME="158"></A>the vicissitude of things, there may be any calamity due, to counterbalance 
<A NAME="159"></A>this great felicity, I beg that it may be diverted from the city and army 
<A NAME="160"></A>of the Romans, and fall, with as little hurt as may be, upon my own head." 
<A NAME="161"></A>Having said these words, and just turning about (as the custom of the Romans 
<A NAME="162"></A>is to turn to the right after adoration or prayer), he stumbled and fell, 
<A NAME="163"></A>to the astonishment of all that were present. But, recovering himself presently 
<A NAME="164"></A>from the fall, he told them that he had received what he had prayed for, 
<A NAME="165"></A>a small mischance, in compensation for the greatest good 
<A NAME="166"></A>fortune.
<A NAME="167"></A><BR><BR>Having sacked the city, he resolved, according as he had vowed, 
<A NAME="168"></A>to carry Juno's image to Rome; and, the workmen being ready for that purpose, 
<A NAME="169"></A>he sacrificed to the goddess, and made his supplications that she would 
<A NAME="170"></A>be pleased to accept of their devotion toward her, and graciously vouchsafe 
<A NAME="171"></A>to accept of a place among the gods that presided at Rome; and the statue, 
<A NAME="172"></A>they say, answered in a low voice that she was ready and willing to go. 
<A NAME="173"></A>Livy writes, that, in praying, Camillus touched the goddess, and invited 
<A NAME="174"></A>her, and that some of the standers-by cried out that she was willing and 
<A NAME="175"></A>would come. They who stand up for the miracle and endeavour to maintain 
<A NAME="176"></A>it have one great advocate on their side in the wonderful fortune of the 
<A NAME="177"></A>city, which, from a small and contemptible beginning, could never have 
<A NAME="178"></A>attained to that greatness and power without many signal manifestations 
<A NAME="179"></A>of the divine presence and co-operation. Other wonders of the like nature, 
<A NAME="180"></A>drops of sweat seen to stand on statues, groans heard from them, the figures 
<A NAME="181"></A>seen to turn round and to close their eyes, are recorded by many ancient 
<A NAME="182"></A>historians; and we ourselves could relate divers wonderful things, which 
<A NAME="183"></A>we have been told by men of our own time, that are not lightly to be rejected; 
<A NAME="184"></A>but to give too easy credit to such things, or wholly to disbelieve them, 
<A NAME="185"></A>is equally dangerous, so incapable is human infirmity of keeping any bounds, 
<A NAME="186"></A>or exercising command over itself, running off sometimes to superstition 
<A NAME="187"></A>and dotage, at other times to the contempt and neglect of all that is supernatural. 
<A NAME="188"></A>But moderation is best, and to avoid all extremes.
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR>Camillus, however, whether puffed up with the greatness of his 
<A NAME="190"></A>achievement in conquering a city that was the rival of Rome, and had held 
<A NAME="191"></A>out a ten years' siege, or exalted with the felicitations of those that 
<A NAME="192"></A>were about him, assumed to himself more than became a civil and legal magistrate; 
<A NAME="193"></A>among other things, in the pride and haughtiness of his triumph, driving 
<A NAME="194"></A>through Rome in a chariot drawn with four white horses, which no general 
<A NAME="195"></A>either before or since ever did; for the Romans consider such a mode of 
<A NAME="196"></A>conveyance to be sacred and specially set apart to the king, and father 
<A NAME="197"></A>of the gods. This alienated the hearts of his fellow-citizens, who were 
<A NAME="198"></A>not accustomed to such pomp and display.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR>The second pique they had against him was his opposing the law 
<A NAME="200"></A>by which the city was to be divided; for the tribunes of the people brought 
<A NAME="201"></A>forward a motion that the people and senate should be divided into two 
<A NAME="202"></A>parts, one of which should remain at home, the other as the lot should 
<A NAME="203"></A>decide, remove to the new-taken city. By which means they should not only 
<A NAME="204"></A>have much more room, but, by the advantage of two great and magnificent 
<A NAME="205"></A>cities, be better able to maintain their territories and their fortunes 
<A NAME="206"></A>in general. The people, therefore, who were numerous and indigent, greedily 
<A NAME="207"></A>embraced it, and crowded continually to the forum, with tumultuous demands 
<A NAME="208"></A>to have it put to the vote. But the senate and the noblest citizens, judging 
<A NAME="209"></A>the proceedings of the tribunes to tend rather to a destruction than a 
<A NAME="210"></A>division of Rome, greatly averse to it, went to Camillus for assistance, 
<A NAME="211"></A>who, fearing the result if it came to a direct contest, contrived to occupy 
<A NAME="212"></A>the people with other business, and so staved it off. He thus became unpopular. 
<A NAME="213"></A>But the greatest and most apparent cause of their dislike against him arose 
<A NAME="214"></A>from the tenths of the spoil; the multitude having here, if not a just, 
<A NAME="215"></A>yet a plausible case against him. For it seems, as he went to the siege 
<A NAME="216"></A>of Veii, he had vowed to Apollo that if he took the city he would dedicate 
<A NAME="217"></A>to him the tenth of the spoil. The city being taken and sacked, whether 
<A NAME="218"></A>he was loth to trouble the soldiers at that time, or that through the multitude 
<A NAME="219"></A>of business he had forgotten his vow, he suffered them to enjoy that part 
<A NAME="220"></A>of the spoils also. Some time afterwards, when his authority was laid down, 
<A NAME="221"></A>he brought the matter before the senate, and the priests, at the same time, 
<A NAME="222"></A>reported, out of the sacrifices, that there were intimations of divine 
<A NAME="223"></A>anger, requiring propitiations and offerings. The senate decreed the obligations 
<A NAME="224"></A>to be in force.
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR>But seeing it was difficult for every one to produce the very same 
<A NAME="226"></A>things they had taken, to be divided anew, they ordained that every one 
<A NAME="227"></A>upon oath should bring into the public the tenth part of his gains. This 
<A NAME="228"></A>occasioned many annoyances and hardships to the soldiers, who were poor 
<A NAME="229"></A>men, and had endured much in the war, and now were forced, out of what 
<A NAME="230"></A>they had gained and spent, to bring in so great a proportion. Camillus, 
<A NAME="231"></A>being assaulted by their clamour and tumults, for want of a better excuse, 
<A NAME="232"></A>betook himself to the poorest of defences, confessing he had forgotten 
<A NAME="233"></A>his vow; they in turn complained that he had vowed the tenth of the enemy's 
<A NAME="234"></A>goods, and now levied it out of the tenth of the citizens'. Nevertheless, 
<A NAME="235"></A>every one having brought in his due proportion, it was decreed that out 
<A NAME="236"></A>of it a bowl of massy gold should be made, and sent to Delphi. And when 
<A NAME="237"></A>there was great scarcity of gold in the city, and the magistrates were 
<A NAME="238"></A>considering where to get it, the Roman ladies, meeting together and consulting 
<A NAME="239"></A>among themselves, out of the golden ornaments they wore contributed as 
<A NAME="240"></A>much as went to the making of the offering, which in weight came to eight 
<A NAME="241"></A>talents of gold. The senate, to give them the honour they had deserved, 
<A NAME="242"></A>ordained that funeral orations should be used at the obsequies of women 
<A NAME="243"></A>as well as men, it having never before been a custom that any women after 
<A NAME="244"></A>death should receive any public eulogy. Choosing out, therefore, three 
<A NAME="245"></A>of the noblest citizens as a deputation, they sent them in a vessel of 
<A NAME="246"></A>war, well manned and sumptuously adorned. Storm and calm at sea may both, 
<A NAME="247"></A>they say, alike be dangerous; as they at this time experienced, being brought 
<A NAME="248"></A>almost to the very brink of destruction, and, beyond all expectation, escaping. 
<A NAME="249"></A>For near the isles of Aeolus the wind slacking, galleys of the Lipareans 
<A NAME="250"></A>came upon them, taking them for pirates; and, when they held up their hands 
<A NAME="251"></A>as suppliants, forbore indeed from violence, but took their ship in tow, 
<A NAME="252"></A>and carried her into the harbour, where they exposed to sale their goods 
<A NAME="253"></A>and persons as lawful prize, they being pirates; and scarcely, at last, 
<A NAME="254"></A>by the virtue and interest of one man, Timasitheus by name, who was in 
<A NAME="255"></A>office as general, and used his utmost persuasion, they were, with much 
<A NAME="256"></A>ado, dismissed. He, however, himself sent out some of his own vessels with 
<A NAME="257"></A>them, to accompany them in their voyage and assist them at the dedication; 
<A NAME="258"></A>for which he received honours at Rome, as he had deserved.
<A NAME="259"></A><BR><BR>And now the tribunes of the people again resuming their motion 
<A NAME="260"></A>for the division of the city, the war against the Faliscans luckily broke 
<A NAME="261"></A>out, giving liberty to the chief citizens to choose what magistrates they 
<A NAME="262"></A>pleased, and to appoint Camillus military tribune, with five colleagues; 
<A NAME="263"></A>affairs then requiring a commander of authority and reputation, as well 
<A NAME="264"></A>as experience. And when the people had ratified the election, he marched 
<A NAME="265"></A>with his forces into the territories of the Faliscans, and laid siege to 
<A NAME="266"></A>Falerii, a well-fortified city, and plentifully stored with all necessaries 
<A NAME="267"></A>of war. And although he perceived it would be no small work to take it, 
<A NAME="268"></A>and no little time would be required for it, yet he was willing to exercise 
<A NAME="269"></A>the citizens and keep them abroad, that they might have no leisure, idling 
<A NAME="270"></A>at home, to follow the tribunes in factions and seditions; a very common 
<A NAME="271"></A>remedy, indeed, with the Romans, who thus carried off, like good physicians, 
<A NAME="272"></A>the ill humours of their commonwealth. The Falerians, trusting in the strength 
<A NAME="273"></A>of their city, which was well fortified on all sides, made so little account 
<A NAME="274"></A>of the siege, that all, with the exception of those that guarded the walls, 
<A NAME="275"></A>as in times of peace, walked about the streets in their common dress; the 
<A NAME="276"></A>boys went to school, and were led by their master to play and exercise 
<A NAME="277"></A>about the town walls; for the Falerians, like the Greeks, used to have 
<A NAME="278"></A>a single teacher for many pupils, wishing their children to live and be 
<A NAME="279"></A>brought up from the beginning in each other's company.
<A NAME="280"></A><BR><BR>This schoolmaster, designing to betray the Falerians by their children, 
<A NAME="281"></A>led them out every day under the town wall, at first but a little way, 
<A NAME="282"></A>and, when they had exercised, brought them home again. Afterwards by degrees 
<A NAME="283"></A>he drew them farther and farther, till by practice he had made them bold 
<A NAME="284"></A>and fearless, as if no danger was about them; and at last, having got them 
<A NAME="285"></A>all together, he brought them to the outposts of the Romans, and delivered 
<A NAME="286"></A>them up, demanding to be led to Camillus. Where being come, and standing 
<A NAME="287"></A>in the middle, he said that he was the master and teacher of these children, 
<A NAME="288"></A>but preferring his favour before all other obligations, he was come to 
<A NAME="289"></A>deliver up his charge to him, and, in that, the whole city. When Camillus 
<A NAME="290"></A>had heard him out, he was astounded at the treachery of the act, and, turning 
<A NAME="291"></A>to the standers-by, observed that "war, indeed, is of necessity attended 
<A NAME="292"></A>with much injustice and violence! Certain laws, however, all good men observe 
<A NAME="293"></A>even in war itself, nor is victory so great an object as to induce us to 
<A NAME="294"></A>incur for its sake obligations for base and impious acts. A great general 
<A NAME="295"></A>should rely on his own virtue, and not on other men's vices." Which said, 
<A NAME="296"></A>he commanded the officers to tear off the man's clothes, and bind his hands 
<A NAME="297"></A>behind him, and give the boys rods and scourges, to punish the traitor 
<A NAME="298"></A>and drive him back to the city. By this time the Falerians had discovered 
<A NAME="299"></A>the treachery of the schoolmaster, and the city, as was likely, was full 
<A NAME="300"></A>of lamentations and cries for their calamity, men and women of worth running 
<A NAME="301"></A>in distraction about the walls and gates; when, behold, the boys came whipping 
<A NAME="302"></A>their master on naked and bound, calling Camillus their preserver and god 
<A NAME="303"></A>and father. Insomuch that it struck not only into the parents, but the 
<A NAME="304"></A>rest of the citizens that saw what was done, such admiration and love of 
<A NAME="305"></A>Camillus's justice, that, immediately meeting in assembly, they sent ambassadors 
<A NAME="306"></A>to him, to resign whatever they had to his disposal. Camillus sent them 
<A NAME="307"></A>to Rome, where, being brought into the senate, they spoke to this purpose: 
<A NAME="308"></A>that the Romans, preferring justice before victory, had taught them rather 
<A NAME="309"></A>to embrace submission than liberty; they did not so much confess themselves 
<A NAME="310"></A>to be inferior in strength, as they must acknowledge them to be superior 
<A NAME="311"></A>in virtue. The senate remitted the whole matter to Camillus, to judge and 
<A NAME="312"></A>order as he thought fit; who, taking a sum of money of the Falerians, and, 
<A NAME="313"></A>making a peace with the whole nation of the Faliscans, returned 
<A NAME="314"></A>home.
<A NAME="315"></A><BR><BR>But the soldiers, who had expected to have the pillage of the city, 
<A NAME="316"></A>when they came to Rome empty-handed, railed against Camillus among their 
<A NAME="317"></A>fellow-citizens, as a hater of the people, and one that grudged all advantage 
<A NAME="318"></A>to the poor. Afterwards, when the tribunes of the people again brought 
<A NAME="319"></A>their motion for dividing the city to the vote, Camillus appeared openly 
<A NAME="320"></A>against it, shrinking from no unpopularity, and inveighing boldly against 
<A NAME="321"></A>the promoters of it, and so urging and constraining the multitude that 
<A NAME="322"></A>contrary to their inclinations they rejected the proposal but yet hated 
<A NAME="323"></A>Camillus. Insomuch that though a great misfortune befell him in his family 
<A NAME="324"></A>(one of his two sons dying of a disease), commiseration for this could 
<A NAME="325"></A>not in the least make them abate their malice. And indeed he took this 
<A NAME="326"></A>loss with immoderate sorrow being a man naturally of a mild and tender 
<A NAME="327"></A>disposition and when the accusation was preferred against him, kept his 
<A NAME="328"></A>house, and mourned amongst the women of his family.
<A NAME="329"></A><BR><BR>His accuser was Lucius Apuleius; the charge, appropriation of the 
<A NAME="330"></A>Tuscan spoils; certain brass gates, part of those spoils, were said to 
<A NAME="331"></A>be in his possession. The people were exasperated against him, and it was 
<A NAME="332"></A>plain they would take hold of any occasion to condemn him. Gathering, therefore, 
<A NAME="333"></A>together his friends and fellow-soldiers, and such as had borne command 
<A NAME="334"></A>with him, a considerable number in all, he besought them that they would 
<A NAME="335"></A>not suffer him to be unjustly overborne by shameful accusations, and left 
<A NAME="336"></A>the mock and scorn of his enemies. His friends, having advised and consulted 
<A NAME="337"></A>among themselves, made answer, that, as to the sentence, they did not see 
<A NAME="338"></A>how they could help him, but that they would contribute to whatsoever fine 
<A NAME="339"></A>should be set upon him. Not able to endure so great an indignity, he resolved, 
<A NAME="340"></A>in his anger, to leave the city, and go into exile; and so, having taken 
<A NAME="341"></A>leave of his wife and his son, he went silently to the gate of the city, 
<A NAME="342"></A>and there stopping and turning round, stretched out his hands to the Capitol, 
<A NAME="343"></A>and prayed to the gods, that if, without any fault of his own, but merely 
<A NAME="344"></A>through the malice and violence of the people, he was driven out into banishment, 
<A NAME="345"></A>the Romans might quickly repent of it; and that all mankind might witness 
<A NAME="346"></A>their need for the assistance, and desire for the return of 
<A NAME="347"></A>Camillus.
<A NAME="348"></A><BR><BR>Thus, like Achilles, having left his imprecations on the citizens, 
<A NAME="349"></A>he went into banishment; so that, neither appearing nor making defence, 
<A NAME="350"></A>he was condemned in the sum of fifteen thousand ases, which, reduced to 
<A NAME="351"></A>silver, make one thousand five hundred drachmas; for the as was the money 
<A NAME="352"></A>of the time, ten of such copper pieces making the denarius, or piece of 
<A NAME="353"></A>ten. And there is not a Roman but believes that immediately upon the prayers 
<A NAME="354"></A>of Camillus, a sudden judgment followed, and that he received a revenge 
<A NAME="355"></A>for the injustice done unto him; which though we cannot think was pleasant, 
<A NAME="356"></A>but rather grievous and bitter to him, yet was very remarkable, and noised 
<A NAME="357"></A>over the whole world; such a punishment visited the city of Rome, an era 
<A NAME="358"></A>of such loss and danger and disgrace so quickly succeeded; whether it thus 
<A NAME="359"></A>fell out by fortune, or it be the office of some god not to see injured 
<A NAME="360"></A>virtue go unavenged.
<A NAME="361"></A><BR><BR>The first token that seemed to threaten some mischief to ensue 
<A NAME="362"></A>was the death of the censor Julius; for the Romans have a religious reverence 
<A NAME="363"></A>for the office of a censor, and esteem it sacred. The second was that, 
<A NAME="364"></A>just before Camillus went into exile, Marcus Caedicius, a person of no 
<A NAME="365"></A>great distinction, nor of the rank of senator, but esteemed a good and 
<A NAME="366"></A>respectable man, reported to the military tribunes a thing worthy their 
<A NAME="367"></A>consideration; that, going along the night before in the street called 
<A NAME="368"></A>the New Way, and being called by somebody in a loud voice, he turned about, 
<A NAME="369"></A>but could see no one, but heard a voice greater than human, which said 
<A NAME="370"></A>these words, "Go, Marcus Caedicius, and early in the morning tell the military 
<A NAME="371"></A>tribunes that they are shortly to expect the Gauls." But the tribunes made 
<A NAME="372"></A>a mock and sport with the story, and a little after came Camillus's 
<A NAME="373"></A>banishment.
<A NAME="374"></A><BR><BR>The Gauls are of the Celtic race, and are reported to have been 
<A NAME="375"></A>compelled by their numbers to leave their country, which was insufficient 
<A NAME="376"></A>to sustain them all, and to have gone in search of other homes. And being, 
<A NAME="377"></A>many thousands of them, young men and able to bear arms, and carrying with 
<A NAME="378"></A>them a still greater number of women and young children, some of them, 
<A NAME="379"></A>passing the Riphaean mountains, fell upon the Northern Ocean, and possessed 
<A NAME="380"></A>themselves of the farthest parts of Europe; others, seating themselves 
<A NAME="381"></A>between the Pyrenean mountains and the Alps, lived there a considerable 
<A NAME="382"></A>time, nearer to the Senones and Celtorii; but, afterwards tasting wine 
<A NAME="383"></A>which was then first brought them out of Italy, they were all so much taken 
<A NAME="384"></A>with the liquor, and transported with the hitherto unknown delight, that, 
<A NAME="385"></A>snatching up their arms and taking their families along with them, they 
<A NAME="386"></A>marched directly to the Alps, to find out the country which yielded such 
<A NAME="387"></A>fruit, pronouncing all others barren and useless. He that first brought 
<A NAME="388"></A>wine among them and was the chief instigator of their coming into Italy 
<A NAME="389"></A>is said to have been one Aruns, a Tuscan, a man of noble extraction, and 
<A NAME="390"></A>not of bad natural character, but involved in the following misfortune. 
<A NAME="391"></A>He was guardian to an orphan, one of the richest of the country, and much 
<A NAME="392"></A>admired for his beauty, whose name was Lucumo. From his childhood he had 
<A NAME="393"></A>been bred up with Aruns in his family, and when now grown up did not leave 
<A NAME="394"></A>his house, professing to wish for the enjoyment of his society. And thus 
<A NAME="395"></A>for a great while he secretly enjoyed Aruns's wife, corrupting her, and 
<A NAME="396"></A>himself corrupted by her. But when they were both so far gone in their 
<A NAME="397"></A>passion that they could neither refrain their lust nor conceal it, the 
<A NAME="398"></A>young man seized the woman and openly sought to carry her away. The husband, 
<A NAME="399"></A>going to law, and finding himself overpowered by the interest and money 
<A NAME="400"></A>of his opponent, left his country and, hearing of the state of the Gauls, 
<A NAME="401"></A>went to them, and was the conductor of their expedition into 
<A NAME="402"></A>Italy.
<A NAME="403"></A><BR><BR>At their first coming they at once possessed themselves of all 
<A NAME="404"></A>that country which anciently the Tuscans inhabited, reaching from the Alps 
<A NAME="405"></A>to both the seas, as the names themselves testify; for the North or Adriatic 
<A NAME="406"></A>Sea is named from the Tuscan city Adria, and that to the south the Tuscan 
<A NAME="407"></A>Sea simply. The whole country is rich in fruit-trees, has excellent pasture, 
<A NAME="408"></A>and is well watered with rivers. It had eighteen large and beautiful cities, 
<A NAME="409"></A>well provided with all the means for industry and wealth, and all the enjoyments 
<A NAME="410"></A>and pleasures of life. The Gauls cast out the Tuscans, and seated themselves 
<A NAME="411"></A>in them. But this was long before.
<A NAME="412"></A><BR><BR>The Gauls at this time were besieging Clusium, a Tuscan city. The 
<A NAME="413"></A>Clusinians sent to the Romans for succour, desiring them to interpose with 
<A NAME="414"></A>the barbarians by letters and ambassadors. There were sent three of the 
<A NAME="415"></A>family of the Fabii, persons of high rank and distinction in the city. 
<A NAME="416"></A>The Gauls received them courteously, from respect to the name of Rome, 
<A NAME="417"></A>and, giving over the assault which was then making upon the walls, came 
<A NAME="418"></A>to conference with them; when the ambassadors asking what injury they had 
<A NAME="419"></A>received of the Clusinians that they thus invaded their city, Brennus, 
<A NAME="420"></A>King of the Gauls, laughed and made answer: "The Clusinians do us injury, 
<A NAME="421"></A>in that, being able only to till a small parcel of ground, they must needs 
<A NAME="422"></A>possess a great territory, and will not yield any part to us who are strangers, 
<A NAME="423"></A>many in number, and poor. In the same nature, O Romans, formerly the Albans, 
<A NAME="424"></A>Fidenates, and Ardeates, and now lately the Veientines and Capenates, and 
<A NAME="425"></A>many of the Faliscans and Volscians, did you injury; upon whom ye make 
<A NAME="426"></A>war if they do not yield you part of what they possess, make slaves of 
<A NAME="427"></A>them, waste and spoil their country, and ruin their cities; neither in 
<A NAME="428"></A>so doing are cruel or unjust, but follow that most ancient of all laws, 
<A NAME="429"></A>which gives the possessions of the feeble to the strong; which begins with 
<A NAME="430"></A>God and ends in the beasts; since all these, by nature, seek the stronger 
<A NAME="431"></A>to have advantage over the weaker. Cease, therefore, to pity the Clusinians 
<A NAME="432"></A>whom we besiege, lest ye teach the Gauls to be kind and compassionate to 
<A NAME="433"></A>those that are oppressed by you." By this answer the Romans, perceiving 
<A NAME="434"></A>that Brennus was not to be treated with, went into Clusium, and encouraged 
<A NAME="435"></A>and stirred up the inhabitants to make a sally with them upon the barbarians, 
<A NAME="436"></A>which they did either to try their strength or to show their own. The sally 
<A NAME="437"></A>being made, and the fight growing hot about the walls, one of the Fabii, 
<A NAME="438"></A>Quintus Ambustus, being well mounted, and setting spurs to his horse, made 
<A NAME="439"></A>full against a Gaul, a man of huge bulk and stature, whom he saw riding 
<A NAME="440"></A>out at a distance from the rest. At the first he was not recognized, through 
<A NAME="441"></A>the quickness of the conflict and the glittering of his armour, that precluded 
<A NAME="442"></A>any view of him; but when he had overthrown the Gaul, and was going to 
<A NAME="443"></A>gather the spoils, Brennus knew him; and, invoking the gods to be witness, 
<A NAME="444"></A>that, contrary to the known and common law of nations, which is holily 
<A NAME="445"></A>observed by all mankind, he who had come as an ambassador had now engaged 
<A NAME="446"></A>in hostility against him, he drew off his men, and bidding Clusium farewell, 
<A NAME="447"></A>led his army directly to Rome. But not wishing that it should look as if 
<A NAME="448"></A>they took advantage of that injury, and were ready to embrace any occasion 
<A NAME="449"></A>of quarrel, he sent a herald to demand the man in punishment, and in the 
<A NAME="450"></A>meantime marched leisurely on.
<A NAME="451"></A><BR><BR>The senate being met at Rome, among many others that spoke against 
<A NAME="452"></A>the Fabii, the priests called fecials were the most decided, who, on the 
<A NAME="453"></A>religious ground, urged the senate that they should lay the whole guilt 
<A NAME="454"></A>and penalty of the fact upon him that committed it, and so exonerate the 
<A NAME="455"></A>rest. These fecials Numa Pompilius, the mildest and justest of kings, constituted 
<A NAME="456"></A>guardians of peace, and the judges and determiners of all causes by which 
<A NAME="457"></A>war may justifiably be made. The senate referring the whole matter to the 
<A NAME="458"></A>people, and the priests there, as well as in the senate, pleading against 
<A NAME="459"></A>Fabius, the multitude, however, so little regarded their authority, that 
<A NAME="460"></A>in scorn and contempt of it they chose Fabius and the rest of his brothers 
<A NAME="461"></A>military tribunes. The Gauls, on hearing this, in great rage threw aside 
<A NAME="462"></A>every delay, and hastened on with all the speed they could make. The places 
<A NAME="463"></A>through which they marched, terrified with their numbers and the splendour 
<A NAME="464"></A>of their preparations for war, and in alarm at their violence and fierceness, 
<A NAME="465"></A>began to give up their territories as already lost, with little doubt but 
<A NAME="466"></A>their cities would quickly follow; contrary, however, to expectation, they 
<A NAME="467"></A>did no injury as they passed, nor took anything from the fields; and, as 
<A NAME="468"></A>they went by any city, cried out that they were going to Rome; that the 
<A NAME="469"></A>Romans only were their enemies, and that they took all others for their 
<A NAME="470"></A>friends.
<A NAME="471"></A><BR><BR>Whilst the barbarians were thus hastening with all speed, the military 
<A NAME="472"></A>tribunes brought the Romans into the field to be ready to engage them, 
<A NAME="473"></A>being not inferior to the Gauls in number (for they were no less than forty 
<A NAME="474"></A>thousand foot), but most of them raw soldiers, and such as had never handled 
<A NAME="475"></A>a weapon before. Besides, they had wholly neglected all religious usages, 
<A NAME="476"></A>had not obtained favourable sacrifices, nor made inquiries of the prophets, 
<A NAME="477"></A>natural in danger and before battle. No less did the multitude commanders 
<A NAME="478"></A>distract and confound their proceedings; frequently before, upon less occasions, 
<A NAME="479"></A>they had chosen a single leader, with the title of dictator, being sensible 
<A NAME="480"></A>of what great importance it is in critical times to have the soldiers united 
<A NAME="481"></A>under one general with the entire and absolute control placed in his hands. 
<A NAME="482"></A>Add to all, the remembrance of Camillus's treatment, which made it now 
<A NAME="483"></A>seem a dangerous thing for officers to command without humouring their 
<A NAME="484"></A>soldiers. In this condition they left the city, and encamped by the river 
<A NAME="485"></A>Allia, about ten miles from Rome; and not far from the place where it falls 
<A NAME="486"></A>into the Tiber; and here the Gauls came upon them, and, after a disgraceful 
<A NAME="487"></A>resistance, devoid of order and discipline, they were miserably defeated. 
<A NAME="488"></A>The left wing was immediately driven into the river, and there destroyed; 
<A NAME="489"></A>the right had less damage by declining the shock, and from the low grounds 
<A NAME="490"></A>getting to the tops of the hills, from whence most of them afterwards dropped 
<A NAME="491"></A>into the city; the rest, as many as escaped, the enemy being weary of the 
<A NAME="492"></A>slaughter, stole by night to Veii, giving up Rome and all that was in it 
<A NAME="493"></A>for lost.
<A NAME="494"></A><BR><BR>This battle was fought about the summer solstice, the moon being 
<A NAME="495"></A>at full, the very same day in which the sad disaster of the Fabii had happened, 
<A NAME="496"></A>when three hundred of that name were at one time cut off by the Tuscans. 
<A NAME="497"></A>But from this second loss and defeat the day got the name of Alliensis 
<A NAME="498"></A>from the river Allia, and still retains it. The question of unlucky days, 
<A NAME="499"></A>whether we should consider any to be so, and whether Heraclitus did well 
<A NAME="500"></A>in upbraiding Hesiod for distinguishing them into fortunate and unfortunate, 
<A NAME="501"></A>as ignorant that the nature of every day is the same, I have examined in 
<A NAME="502"></A>another place; but upon occasion of the present subject, I think it will 
<A NAME="503"></A>not be amiss to annex a few examples relating to this matter. On the fifth 
<A NAME="504"></A>of their month Hippodromius, which corresponds to the Athenian Hecatombaeon, 
<A NAME="505"></A>the Boeotians gained two signal victories, the one at Leuctra, the other 
<A NAME="506"></A>at Ceressus, about three hundred years before, when they overcame Lattamyas 
<A NAME="507"></A>and the Thessalians, both which asserted the liberty of Greece. Again, 
<A NAME="508"></A>on the sixth of Boedromion, the Persians were worsted by the Greeks at 
<A NAME="509"></A>Marathon; on the third, at Plataea, as also at Mycale; on the twenty-fifth, 
<A NAME="510"></A>at Arbela. The Athenians, about the full moon in Boedromion, gained their 
<A NAME="511"></A>sea-victory at Naxos under the conduct of Chabrias; on the twentieth, at 
<A NAME="512"></A>Salamis, as we have shown in our treatise on Days. Thargelion was a very 
<A NAME="513"></A>unfortunate month to the barbarians, for in it Alexander overcame Darius's 
<A NAME="514"></A>generals on the Granicus; and the Carthaginians, on the twenty-fourth, 
<A NAME="515"></A>were beaten by Timoleon in Sicily, on which same day and month Troy seems 
<A NAME="516"></A>to have been taken, as Ephorus, Callisthenes, Damastes, and Phylarchus 
<A NAME="517"></A>state. On the other hand, the month Metagitnion, which in Boeotia is called 
<A NAME="518"></A>Panemus, was not very lucky to the Greeks; for on its seventh day they 
<A NAME="519"></A>were defeated by Antipater, at the battle in Cranon, and utterly ruined; 
<A NAME="520"></A>and before, at Chaeronea, were defeated by Philip; and on the very same 
<A NAME="521"></A>day, same month, and same year, those that went with Archidamus into Italy 
<A NAME="522"></A>were there cut off by the barbarians. The Carthaginians also observe the 
<A NAME="523"></A>twenty-first of the same month, as bringing with it the largest number 
<A NAME="524"></A>and the severest of their losses. I am not ignorant that, about the Feast 
<A NAME="525"></A>of Mysteries, Thebes was destroyed the second time by Alexander; and after 
<A NAME="526"></A>that, upon the very twentieth of Boedromion, on which day they lead forth 
<A NAME="527"></A>the mystic Iacchus, the Athenians received a garrison of the Macedonians. 
<A NAME="528"></A>On the selfsame day the Romans lost their army under Caepio by the Cimbrians, 
<A NAME="529"></A>and in a subsequent year, under the conduct of Lucullus, overcame the Armenians 
<A NAME="530"></A>and Tigranes. King Attalus and Pompey died both on their birthdays. One 
<A NAME="531"></A>could reckon up several that have had variety of fortune on the same day. 
<A NAME="532"></A>This day, meantime, is one of the unfortunate ones to the Romans, and for 
<A NAME="533"></A>its sake two others in every month; fear and superstition, as the custom 
<A NAME="534"></A>of it is, more and more prevailing. But I have discussed this more accurately 
<A NAME="535"></A>in my Roman Questions.
<A NAME="536"></A><BR><BR>And now, after the battle, had the Gauls immediately pursued those 
<A NAME="537"></A>that fled, there had been no remedy but Rome must have wholly been ruined, 
<A NAME="538"></A>and those who remained in it utterly destroyed; such was the terror that 
<A NAME="539"></A>those who escaped the battle brought with them into the city, and with 
<A NAME="540"></A>such distraction and confusion were themselves in turn infected. But the 
<A NAME="541"></A>Gauls, not imagining their victory to be so considerable, and overtaken 
<A NAME="542"></A>with the present joy, fell to feasting and dividing the spoil, by which 
<A NAME="543"></A>means they gave leisure to those who were for leaving the city to make 
<A NAME="544"></A>their escape, and to those that remained to anticipate and prepare for 
<A NAME="545"></A>their coming. For they who resolved to stay at Rome, abandoning the rest 
<A NAME="546"></A>of the city, betook themselves to the Capitol, which they fortified with 
<A NAME="547"></A>the help of missiles and new works. One of their principal cares was of 
<A NAME="548"></A>their holy things, most of which they conveyed into the Capitol. But the 
<A NAME="549"></A>consecrated fire the vestal virgins took, and fled with it, as likewise 
<A NAME="550"></A>their other sacred things. Some write that they have nothing in their charge 
<A NAME="551"></A>but the ever-living fire which Numa had ordained to be worshipped as the 
<A NAME="552"></A>principle of all things; for fire is the most active thing in nature, and 
<A NAME="553"></A>all production is either motion, or attended with motion; all the other 
<A NAME="554"></A>parts of matter, so long as they are without warmth, lie sluggish and dead, 
<A NAME="555"></A>and require the accession of a sort of soul or vitality in the principle 
<A NAME="556"></A>of heat; and upon that accession, in whatever way, immediately receive 
<A NAME="557"></A>a capacity either of acting or being acted upon. And thus Numa, a man curious 
<A NAME="558"></A>in such things, and whose wisdom made it thought that he conversed with 
<A NAME="559"></A>the Muses, consecrated fire, and ordained it to be kept ever burning, as 
<A NAME="560"></A>an image of that eternal power which orders and actuates all things. Others 
<A NAME="561"></A>say that this fire was kept burning in front of the holy things, as in 
<A NAME="562"></A>Greece, for purification, and that there were other things hid in the most 
<A NAME="563"></A>secret part of the temple, which were kept from the view of all, except 
<A NAME="564"></A>those virgins whom they call vestals. The most common opinion was, that 
<A NAME="565"></A>the image of Pallas, brought into Italy by Aeneas, was laid up there; others 
<A NAME="566"></A>say that the Samothracian images lay there, telling a story how that Dardanus 
<A NAME="567"></A>carried them to Troy, and when he had built the city, celebrated those 
<A NAME="568"></A>rites, and dedicated those images there; that after Troy was taken, Aeneas 
<A NAME="569"></A>stole them away, and kept them till his coming into Italy. But they who 
<A NAME="570"></A>profess to know more of the matter affirm that there are two barrels, not 
<A NAME="571"></A>of any great size, one of which stands open and has nothing in it, the 
<A NAME="572"></A>other full and sealed up; but that neither of them may be seen but by the 
<A NAME="573"></A>most holy virgins. Others think that they who say this are misled by the 
<A NAME="574"></A>fact that the virgins put most of their holy things into two barrels at 
<A NAME="575"></A>this time of the Gaulish invasion, and hid them underground in the temple 
<A NAME="576"></A>of Quirinus; and that from hence that place to this day bears the name 
<A NAME="577"></A>of Barrels.
<A NAME="578"></A><BR><BR>However it be, taking the most precious and important things they 
<A NAME="579"></A>had, they fled away with them, shaping their course along the river-side, 
<A NAME="580"></A>where Lucius Albinius, a simple citizen of Rome, who among others was making 
<A NAME="581"></A>his escape, overtook them, having his wife, children, and goods in a cart; 
<A NAME="582"></A>and, seeing the virgins, dragging along in their arms the holy things of 
<A NAME="583"></A>the gods, in a helpless and weary condition, he caused his wife and children 
<A NAME="584"></A>to get down, and, taking out his goods, put the virgins in the cart, that 
<A NAME="585"></A>they might make their escape to some of the Greek cities. This devout act 
<A NAME="586"></A>of Albinius, and the respect he showed thus signally to the gods at a time 
<A NAME="587"></A>of such extremity, deserved not to be passed over in silence. But the priests 
<A NAME="588"></A>that belonged to other gods, and the most elderly of the senators, men 
<A NAME="589"></A>who had been consuls and had enjoyed triumphs, could not endure to leave 
<A NAME="590"></A>the city; but, putting on their sacred and splendid robes, Fabius the high 
<A NAME="591"></A>priest performing the office, they made their prayers to the gods, and, 
<A NAME="592"></A>devoting themselves, as it were, for their country, sate themselves down 
<A NAME="593"></A>in their ivory chairs in the forum, and in that posture expected the 
<A NAME="594"></A>event.
<A NAME="595"></A><BR><BR>On the third day after the battle, Brennus appeared with his army 
<A NAME="596"></A>at the city, and, finding the gates wide open and no guards upon the walls, 
<A NAME="597"></A>first began to suspect it was some design or stratagem, never dreaming 
<A NAME="598"></A>that the Romans were in so desperate a condition. But when he found it 
<A NAME="599"></A>to be so indeed, he entered at the Colline gate, and took Rome, in the 
<A NAME="600"></A>three hundred and sixtieth year, or a little more, after it was built; 
<A NAME="601"></A>if, indeed, it can be supposed probable that an exact chronological statement 
<A NAME="602"></A>has been preserved of events which were themselves the cause of chronological 
<A NAME="603"></A>difficulties about things of later date; of the calamity itself, however, 
<A NAME="604"></A>and of the fact of the capture, some faint rumours seem to have passed 
<A NAME="605"></A>at the time into Greece. Heraclides Ponticus, who lived not long after 
<A NAME="606"></A>these times, in his hook upon the Soul, relates that a certain report came 
<A NAME="607"></A>from the west, that an army, proceeding from the Hyperboreans, had taken 
<A NAME="608"></A>a Greek city called Rome, seated somewhere upon the great sea. But I do 
<A NAME="609"></A>not wonder that so fabulous and high-flown an author as Heraclides should 
<A NAME="610"></A>embellish the truth of the story with expressions about Hyperboreans and 
<A NAME="611"></A>the great sea. Aristotle the philosopher appears to have heard a correct 
<A NAME="612"></A>statement of the taking of the city by the Gauls, but he calls its deliverer 
<A NAME="613"></A>Lucius; whereas Camillus's surname was not Lucius, but Marcus. But this 
<A NAME="614"></A>is a matter of conjecture.
<A NAME="615"></A><BR><BR>Brennus, having taken possession of Rome, set a strong guard about 
<A NAME="616"></A>the Capitol and, going himself down into the forum, was there struck with 
<A NAME="617"></A>amazement at the sight of so many men sitting in that order and silence 
<A NAME="618"></A>observing that they neither rose at his coming, nor so much as changed 
<A NAME="619"></A>colour or countenance, but remained without fear or concern leaning upon 
<A NAME="620"></A>their staves, and sitting quietly, looking at each other. The Gauls, for 
<A NAME="621"></A>a great while, stood wondering at the strangeness of the sight, not daring 
<A NAME="622"></A>to approach or touch them, taking them for an assembly of superior beings. 
<A NAME="623"></A>But when one, bolder than the rest, drew near to Marcus Papirius, and, 
<A NAME="624"></A>putting forth his hand, gently touched his chin and stroked his long beard, 
<A NAME="625"></A>Papirius with his staff struck him a severe blow on the head; upon which 
<A NAME="626"></A>the barbarian drew his sword and slew him. This was the introduction to 
<A NAME="627"></A>the slaughter; for the rest, following his example, set upon them all and 
<A NAME="628"></A>killed them, and despatched all others that came in their way; and so went 
<A NAME="629"></A>on to the sacking and pillaging the houses, which they continued for many 
<A NAME="630"></A>days ensuing. Afterwards, they burnt them down to the ground and demolished 
<A NAME="631"></A>them, being incensed at those who kept the Capitol, because they would 
<A NAME="632"></A>not yield to summons; but, on the contrary, when assailed, had repelled 
<A NAME="633"></A>them, with some loss, from their defences. This provoked them to ruin the 
<A NAME="634"></A>whole city, and to put to the sword all that came to their hands, young 
<A NAME="635"></A>and old, men, women, and children.
<A NAME="636"></A><BR><BR>And now, the siege of the Capitol having lasted a good while, the 
<A NAME="637"></A>Gauls began to be in want of provision; and dividing their forces, part 
<A NAME="638"></A>of them stayed with their king at the siege, the rest went to forage the 
<A NAME="639"></A>country, ravaging the towns and villages where they came, but not all together 
<A NAME="640"></A>in a body, but in different squadrons and parties; and to such a confidence 
<A NAME="641"></A>had success raised them, that they carelessly rambled about without the 
<A NAME="642"></A>least fear or apprehension of danger. But the greatest and best ordered 
<A NAME="643"></A>body of their forces went to the city of Ardea, where Camillus then sojourned, 
<A NAME="644"></A>having, ever since his leaving Rome, sequestered himself from all business, 
<A NAME="645"></A>and taken to a private life; but now he began to rouse up himself, and 
<A NAME="646"></A>consider not how to avoid or escape the enemy, but to find out an opportunity 
<A NAME="647"></A>to be revenged upon them. And perceiving that the Ardeatians wanted not 
<A NAME="648"></A>men, but rather enterprise, through the inexperience and timidity of their 
<A NAME="649"></A>officers, he began to speak with the young men, first to the effect that 
<A NAME="650"></A>they ought not to ascribe the misfortune of the Romans to the courage of 
<A NAME="651"></A>their enemy, nor attribute the losses they sustained by rash counsel to 
<A NAME="652"></A>the conduct of men who had no title to victory; the event had been only 
<A NAME="653"></A>an evidence of the power of fortune; that it was a brave thing even with 
<A NAME="654"></A>danger to repel a foreign and barbarous invader whose end in conquering 
<A NAME="655"></A>was, like fire, to lay waste and destroy, but if they would be courageous 
<A NAME="656"></A>and resolute he was ready to put an opportunity into their hands to gain 
<A NAME="657"></A>a victory, without hazard at all. When he found the young men embraced 
<A NAME="658"></A>the thing, he went to the magistrates and council of the city, and, having 
<A NAME="659"></A>persuaded them also, he mustered all that could bear arms, and drew them 
<A NAME="660"></A>up within the walls, that they might not be perceived by the enemy, who 
<A NAME="661"></A>was near; who, having scoured the country, and returned heavy-laden with 
<A NAME="662"></A>booty, lay encamped in the plains in a careless and negligent posture, 
<A NAME="663"></A>so that, with the night ensuing upon debauch and drunkenness, silence prevailed 
<A NAME="664"></A>through all the camp. When Camillus learned this from his scouts, he drew 
<A NAME="665"></A>out the Ardeatians, and in the dead of the night, passing in silence over 
<A NAME="666"></A>the ground that lay between, came up to their works, and, commanding his 
<A NAME="667"></A>trumpets to sound and his men to shout and halloo, he struck terror into 
<A NAME="668"></A>them from all, quarters; while drunkenness impeded and sleep retarded their 
<A NAME="669"></A>movements. A few, whom fear had sobered, getting into some order, for a 
<A NAME="670"></A>while resisted; and so died with their weapons in their hands. But the 
<A NAME="671"></A>greatest part of them, buried in wine and sleep, were surprised without 
<A NAME="672"></A>their arms, and despatched; and as many of them as by the advantage of 
<A NAME="673"></A>the night got out of the camp were the next day found scattered abroad 
<A NAME="674"></A>and wandering in the fields, and were picked up by the horse that pursued 
<A NAME="675"></A>them.
<A NAME="676"></A><BR><BR>The fame of this action soon fled through the neighbouring cities, 
<A NAME="677"></A>and stirred up the young men from various quarters to come and join themselves 
<A NAME="678"></A>with him. But none were so much concerned as those Romans who escaped in 
<A NAME="679"></A>the battle of Allia, and were now at Veii, thus lamenting with themselves, 
<A NAME="680"></A>"O heavens, what a commander has Providence bereaved Rome of, to honour 
<A NAME="681"></A>Ardea with his actions! And that city, which brought forth and nursed so 
<A NAME="682"></A>great a man, is lost and gone, and we, destitute of a leader and shut up 
<A NAME="683"></A>within strange walls, sit idle, and see Italy ruined before our eyes. Come, 
<A NAME="684"></A>let us send to the Ardeatians to have back our general, or else, with weapons 
<A NAME="685"></A>in our hands, let us go thither to him; for he is no longer a banished 
<A NAME="686"></A>man, nor we citizens, having no country but what is in the possession of 
<A NAME="687"></A>the enemy." To this they all agreed, and sent to Camillus to desire him 
<A NAME="688"></A>to take the command; but he answered, that he would not, until they that 
<A NAME="689"></A>were in the Capitol should legally appoint him; for he esteemed them, so 
<A NAME="690"></A>long as they were in being, to be his country; that if they should command 
<A NAME="691"></A>him he would readily obey; but against their consent he would intermeddle 
<A NAME="692"></A>with nothing. When this answer was returned, they admired the modesty and 
<A NAME="693"></A>temper of Camillus; but they could not tell how to find a messenger to 
<A NAME="694"></A>carry the intelligence to the Capitol, or rather, indeed, it seemed altogether 
<A NAME="695"></A>impossible for any one to get to the citadel whilst the enemy was in full 
<A NAME="696"></A>possession of the city. But among the young men there was one Pontius Cominius, 
<A NAME="697"></A>of ordinary birth, but ambitious of honour, who proffered himself to run 
<A NAME="698"></A>the hazard, and took no letters with him to those in the Capitol, lest, 
<A NAME="699"></A>if he were intercepted, the enemy might learn the intentions of Camillus; 
<A NAME="700"></A>but, putting on a poor dress and carrying corks under it, he boldly travelled 
<A NAME="701"></A>the greatest part of the way by day, and came to the city when it was dark; 
<A NAME="702"></A>the bridge he could not pass, as it was guarded by the barbarians; so that 
<A NAME="703"></A>taking his clothes, which were neither many nor heavy, and binding them 
<A NAME="704"></A>about his head, he laid his body upon the corks, and swimming with them, 
<A NAME="705"></A>got over to the city. And avoiding those quarters where he perceived the 
<A NAME="706"></A>enemy was awake, which he guessed at by the lights and noise, he went to 
<A NAME="707"></A>the Carmental gate, where there was greatest silence, and where the hill 
<A NAME="708"></A>of the Capitol is steepest and rises with craggy and broken rock. By this 
<A NAME="709"></A>way he got up, though with much difficulty, by the hollow of the cliff, 
<A NAME="710"></A>and presented himself to the guards, saluting them, and telling them his 
<A NAME="711"></A>name; he was taken in, and carried to the commanders. And a senate being 
<A NAME="712"></A>immediately called, he related to them in order the victory of Camillus, 
<A NAME="713"></A>which they had not heard of before, and the proceedings of the soldiers, 
<A NAME="714"></A>urging them to confirm Camillus in the command, as on him alone all their 
<A NAME="715"></A>fellow-countrymen outside the city would rely. Having heard and consulted 
<A NAME="716"></A>of the matter, the senate declared Camillus dictator, and sent back Pontius 
<A NAME="717"></A>the same way that he came, who, with the same success as before, got through 
<A NAME="718"></A>the enemy without being discovered, and delivered to the Romans outside 
<A NAME="719"></A>the decision of the senate, who joyfully received it. Camillus, on his 
<A NAME="720"></A>arrival, found twenty thousand of them ready in arms; with which forces, 
<A NAME="721"></A>and those confederates he brought along with him, he prepared to set upon 
<A NAME="722"></A>the enemy.
<A NAME="723"></A><BR><BR>But at Rome some of the barbarians, passing by chance near the 
<A NAME="724"></A>place at which Pontius by night had got into the Capitol, spied in several 
<A NAME="725"></A>places marks of feet and hands, where he had laid hold and clambered, and 
<A NAME="726"></A>places where the plants that grew to the rock had been rubbed off, and 
<A NAME="727"></A>the earth had slipped, and went accordingly and reported it to the king, 
<A NAME="728"></A>who, coming in person, and viewing it, for the present said nothing, but 
<A NAME="729"></A>in the evening, picking out such of the Gauls as were nimblest of body, 
<A NAME="730"></A>and by living in the mountains were accustomed to climb, he said to them, 
<A NAME="731"></A>"The enemy themselves have shown us a way how to come at them, which we 
<A NAME="732"></A>knew not of before, and have taught us that it is not so difficult and 
<A NAME="733"></A>impossible but that men may overcome it. It would be a great shame, having 
<A NAME="734"></A>begun well, to fail in the end, and to give up a place as impregnable, 
<A NAME="735"></A>when the enemy himself lets us see the way by which it may be taken; for 
<A NAME="736"></A>where it was easy for one man to get up, it will not be hard for many, 
<A NAME="737"></A>one after another; nay, when many shall undertake it, they will be aid 
<A NAME="738"></A>and strength to each other. Rewards and honours shall be bestowed on every 
<A NAME="739"></A>man as he shall acquit himself."
<A NAME="740"></A><BR><BR>When the king had thus spoken, the Gauls cheerfully undertook to 
<A NAME="741"></A>perform it, and in the dead of night a good party of them together, with 
<A NAME="742"></A>great silence, began to climb the rock, clinging to the precipitous and 
<A NAME="743"></A>difficult ascent, which yet upon trial offered a way to them, and proved 
<A NAME="744"></A>less difficult than they had expected. So that the foremost of them having 
<A NAME="745"></A>gained the top of all, and put themselves into order, they all but surprised 
<A NAME="746"></A>the outworks, and mastered the watch, who were fast asleep; for neither 
<A NAME="747"></A>man nor dog perceived their coming. But there were sacred geese kept near 
<A NAME="748"></A>the temple of Juno, which at other times were plentifully fed, but now, 
<A NAME="749"></A>by reason that corn and other provisions were grown scarce for all, were 
<A NAME="750"></A>but in a poor condition. The creature is by nature of quick sense, and 
<A NAME="751"></A>apprehensive of the least noise, so that these, being moreover watchful 
<A NAME="752"></A>through hunger, and restless, immediately discovered the coming of the 
<A NAME="753"></A>Gauls, and, running up and down with their noise and cackling, they raised 
<A NAME="754"></A>the whole camp, while the barbarians on the other side, perceiving themselves 
<A NAME="755"></A>discovered, no longer endeavoured to conceal their attempt, but with shouting 
<A NAME="756"></A>and violence advanced to the assault. The Romans, every one in haste snatching 
<A NAME="757"></A>up the next weapon that came to hand, did what they could on the sudden 
<A NAME="758"></A>occasion. Manlius, a man of consular dignity, of strong body and great 
<A NAME="759"></A>spirit, was the first that made head against them, and, engaging with two 
<A NAME="760"></A>of the enemy at once, with his sword cut off the right arm of one just 
<A NAME="761"></A>as he was lifting up his blade to strike, and, running his target full 
<A NAME="762"></A>in the face of the other, tumbled him headlong down the steep rock; then 
<A NAME="763"></A>mounting the rampart, and there standing with others that came running 
<A NAME="764"></A>to his assistance, drove down the rest of them, who, indeed, to begin, 
<A NAME="765"></A>had not been many, and did nothing worthy of so bold an attempt. The Romans, 
<A NAME="766"></A>having thus escaped this danger, early in the morning took the captain 
<A NAME="767"></A>of the watch and flung him down the rock upon the heads of their enemies, 
<A NAME="768"></A>and to Manlius for his victory voted a reward, intended more for honour 
<A NAME="769"></A>than advantage, bringing him, each man of them as much as he received for 
<A NAME="770"></A>his daily allowance, which was half a pound of bread and one eighth of 
<A NAME="771"></A>a pint of wine.
<A NAME="772"></A><BR><BR>Henceforward, the affairs of the Gauls were daily in a worse and 
<A NAME="773"></A>worse condition; they wanted provisions, being withheld from foraging through 
<A NAME="774"></A>fear of Camillus, and sickness also was amongst them, occasioned by the 
<A NAME="775"></A>number of carcasses that lay in heaps unburied. Being lodged among the 
<A NAME="776"></A>ruins, the ashes, which were very deep, blown about by the winds and combining 
<A NAME="777"></A>with the sultry heats, breathed up, so to say, a dry and searching air, 
<A NAME="778"></A>the inhalation of which was destructive to their health. But the chief 
<A NAME="779"></A>cause was the change from their natural climate, coming as they did out 
<A NAME="780"></A>of shady and hilly countries, abounding in means of shelter from the heat, 
<A NAME="781"></A>to lodge in low, and, in the autumn season, very unhealthy ground; added 
<A NAME="782"></A>to which was the length and tediousness of the siege, as they had now sate 
<A NAME="783"></A>seven months before the Capitol. There was, therefore, a great destruction 
<A NAME="784"></A>among them, and the number of the dead grew so great that the living gave 
<A NAME="785"></A>up burying them. Neither, indeed, were things on that account any better 
<A NAME="786"></A>with the besieged, for famine increased upon them, and despondency with 
<A NAME="787"></A>not hearing anything of Camillus, it being impossible to send any one to 
<A NAME="788"></A>him, the city was so guarded by the barbarians. Things being in this sad 
<A NAME="789"></A>condition on both sides, a motion of treaty was made at first by some of 
<A NAME="790"></A>the outposts, as they happened to speak with one another; which being embraced 
<A NAME="791"></A>by the leading men, Sulpicius, tribune of the Romans, came to a parley 
<A NAME="792"></A>with Brennus, in which it was agreed, that the Romans laying down a thousand 
<A NAME="793"></A>weight of gold, the Gauls upon the receipt of it should immediately quit 
<A NAME="794"></A>the city and territories. The agreement being confirmed by oath on both 
<A NAME="795"></A>sides, and the gold brought forth, the Gauls used false dealing in the 
<A NAME="796"></A>weight, secretly at first, but afterwards openly pulled back and disturbed 
<A NAME="797"></A>the balance; at which the Romans indignantly complaining, Brennus, in a 
<A NAME="798"></A>scoffing and insulting manner, pulled off his sword and belt, and threw 
<A NAME="799"></A>them both into the scales; and when Sulpicius asked what that meant, "What 
<A NAME="800"></A>should it mean," says he, "but woe to the conquered?" which afterwards 
<A NAME="801"></A>became a proverbial saying. As for the Romans, some were so incensed that 
<A NAME="802"></A>they were for taking their gold back again and returning to endure the 
<A NAME="803"></A>siege. Others were for passing by and dissembling a petty injury, and not 
<A NAME="804"></A>to account that the indignity of the thing lay in paying more than was 
<A NAME="805"></A>due, since the paying anything at all was itself a dishonour only submitted 
<A NAME="806"></A>to as a necessity of the times.
<A NAME="807"></A><BR><BR>Whilst this difference remained still unsettled, both amongst themselves 
<A NAME="808"></A>and with the Gauls, Camillus was at the gates with his army; and having 
<A NAME="809"></A>learned what was going on, commanded the main body of his forces to follow 
<A NAME="810"></A>slowly after him in good order, and himself with the choicest of his men 
<A NAME="811"></A>hastening on, went at once to the Romans; where, all giving way to him, 
<A NAME="812"></A>and receiving him as their sole magistrate, with profound silence and order, 
<A NAME="813"></A>he took the gold out of the scales, and delivered it to his officers, and 
<A NAME="814"></A>commanded the Gauls to take their weights and scales and depart; saying 
<A NAME="815"></A>that it was customary with the Romans to deliver their country with iron, 
<A NAME="816"></A>not with gold. And when Brennus began to rage, and say that he was unjustly 
<A NAME="817"></A>dealt with in such a breach of contract, Camillus answered that it was 
<A NAME="818"></A>never legally made, and the agreement of no force or obligation; for that 
<A NAME="819"></A>himself being declared dictator, and there being no other magistrate by 
<A NAME="820"></A>law, the engagement had been made with men who had no power to enter into 
<A NAME="821"></A>it; but now they might say anything they had to urge, for he was come with 
<A NAME="822"></A>full power by law to grant pardon to such as should ask it, or inflict 
<A NAME="823"></A>punishment on the guilty, if they did not repent. At this, Brennus broke 
<A NAME="824"></A>into violent anger, and an immediate quarrel ensued; both sides drew their 
<A NAME="825"></A>swords and attacked, but in confusion, as could not be otherwise amongst 
<A NAME="826"></A>houses, and in narrow lanes and places where it was impossible to form 
<A NAME="827"></A>in any order. But Brennus, presently recollecting himself, called off his 
<A NAME="828"></A>men, and, with the loss of a few only, brought them to their camp; and 
<A NAME="829"></A>rising in the night with all his forces, left the city, and, advancing 
<A NAME="830"></A>about eight miles, encamped upon the way to Gabii. As soon as day appeared, 
<A NAME="831"></A>Camillus came up with him, splendidly armed himself, and his soldiers full 
<A NAME="832"></A>of courage and confidence; and there engaging with him in a sharp conflict, 
<A NAME="833"></A>which lasted a long while, overthrew his army with great slaughter, and 
<A NAME="834"></A>took their camp. Of those that fled, some were presently cut off by the 
<A NAME="835"></A>pursuers; others, and these were the greatest number, dispersed hither 
<A NAME="836"></A>and thither, and were despatched by the people that came sallying out from 
<A NAME="837"></A>the neighbouring towns and villages.
<A NAME="838"></A><BR><BR>Thus Rome was strangely taken, and more strangely recovered, having 
<A NAME="839"></A>been seven whole months in the possession of the barbarians, who entered 
<A NAME="840"></A>her a little after the Ides of July, and were driven out about the Ides 
<A NAME="841"></A>of February following. Camillus triumphed, as he deserved, having saved 
<A NAME="842"></A>his country that was lost, and brought the city, so to say, back again 
<A NAME="843"></A>to itself. For those that had fled abroad, together with their wives and 
<A NAME="844"></A>children, accompanied him as he rode in; and those who had been shut up 
<A NAME="845"></A>in the Capitol, and were reduced almost to the point of perishing with 
<A NAME="846"></A>hunger, went out to meet him, embracing each other as they met, and weeping 
<A NAME="847"></A>for joy, and, through the excess of the present pleasure, scarce believing 
<A NAME="848"></A>in its truth. And when the priests and ministers of the gods appeared bearing 
<A NAME="849"></A>the sacred things, which in their flight they had either hid on the spot, 
<A NAME="850"></A>or conveyed away with them, and now openly showed in safety, the citizens 
<A NAME="851"></A>who saw the blessed sight felt as if with these the gods themselves were 
<A NAME="852"></A>again returned unto Rome. After Camillus had sacrificed to the gods, and 
<A NAME="853"></A>purified the city according to the directions of those properly instructed, 
<A NAME="854"></A>he restored the existing temples, and erected a new one to Rumour, or Voice, 
<A NAME="855"></A>informing himself of the spot in which that voice from heaven came by night 
<A NAME="856"></A>to Marcus Caedicius, foretelling the coming of the barbarian 
<A NAME="857"></A>army.
<A NAME="858"></A><BR><BR>It was a matter of difficulty, and a hard task, amidst so much 
<A NAME="859"></A>rubbish, to discover and re-determine the consecrated places; but by the 
<A NAME="860"></A>zeal of Camillus, and the incessant labour of the priests, it was at last 
<A NAME="861"></A>accomplished. But when it came also to rebuilding the city, which was wholly 
<A NAME="862"></A>demolished, despondency seized the multitude, and a backwardness to engage 
<A NAME="863"></A>in a work for which they had no materials; at a time, too, when they rather 
<A NAME="864"></A>needed relief and repose from their past labours, than any new demands 
<A NAME="865"></A>upon their exhausted strength and impaired fortunes. Thus insensibly they 
<A NAME="866"></A>turned their thoughts again towards Veii, a city ready-built and well-provided, 
<A NAME="867"></A>and gave an opening to the arts of flatterers eager to gratify their desires, 
<A NAME="868"></A>and lent their ears to seditious language flung out against Camillus; as 
<A NAME="869"></A>that, out of ambition and self-glory, he withheld them from a city fit 
<A NAME="870"></A>to receive them, forcing them to live in the midst of ruins, and to re-erect 
<A NAME="871"></A>a pile of burnt rubbish, that he might be esteemed not the chief magistrate 
<A NAME="872"></A>only and general of Rome, but, to the exclusion of Romulus, its founder 
<A NAME="873"></A>also. The senate, therefore, fearing a sedition, would not suffer Camillus, 
<A NAME="874"></A>though desirous, to lay down his authority within the year, though no dictator 
<A NAME="875"></A>had ever held it above six months.
<A NAME="876"></A><BR><BR>They themselves, meantime, used their best endeavours, by kind 
<A NAME="877"></A>persuasions and familiar addresses, to encourage and appease the people, 
<A NAME="878"></A>showing them the shrines and tombs of their ancestors, calling to their 
<A NAME="879"></A>remembrance the sacred spots and holy places which Romulus and Numa or 
<A NAME="880"></A>any other of their kings had consecrated and left to their keeping; and 
<A NAME="881"></A>among the strongest religious arguments, urged the head, newly separated 
<A NAME="882"></A>from the body, which was found in laying the foundation of the Capitol, 
<A NAME="883"></A>marking it as a place destined by fate to be the head of all Italy; and 
<A NAME="884"></A>the holy fire which had just been rekindled again, since the end of the 
<A NAME="885"></A>war, by the vestal virgins; "What a disgrace it would be to them to lose 
<A NAME="886"></A>and extinguish this, leaving the city it belonged to, to be either inhabited 
<A NAME="887"></A>by strangers and new-comers, or left a wild pasture for cattle to graze 
<A NAME="888"></A>on?" Such reasons as these, urged with complaint and expostulation, sometimes 
<A NAME="889"></A>in private upon individuals, and sometimes in their public assemblies, 
<A NAME="890"></A>were met, on the other hand, by laments and protestations of distress and 
<A NAME="891"></A>helplessness; entreaties that, reunited as they just were, after a sort 
<A NAME="892"></A>of shipwreck, naked and destitute, they would not constrain them to patch 
<A NAME="893"></A>up the pieces of a ruined and shattered city, when they had another at 
<A NAME="894"></A>hand ready-built and prepared.
<A NAME="895"></A><BR><BR>Camillus thought good to refer it to general deliberation, and 
<A NAME="896"></A>himself spoke largely and earnestly in behalf of his country, as also many 
<A NAME="897"></A>others. At last, calling to Lucius Lucretius, whose place it was to speak 
<A NAME="898"></A>first, he commanded him to give his sentence, and the rest as they followed, 
<A NAME="899"></A>in order. Silence being made, and Lucretius just about to begin, by chance 
<A NAME="900"></A>a centurion passing by outside with his company of the day-guard called 
<A NAME="901"></A>out with a loud voice to the ensign-bearer to halt and fix his standard, 
<A NAME="902"></A>for this was the best place to stay in. This voice, coming in that moment 
<A NAME="903"></A>of time, and at that crisis of uncertainty and anxiety for the future, 
<A NAME="904"></A>was taken as a direction what was to be done; so that Lucretius, assuming 
<A NAME="905"></A>an attitude of devotion, gave sentence in concurrence with the gods, as 
<A NAME="906"></A>he said, as likewise did all that followed. Even among the common people 
<A NAME="907"></A>it created a wonderful change of feeling; every one now cheered and encouraged 
<A NAME="908"></A>his neighbour, and set himself to the work, proceeding in it, however, 
<A NAME="909"></A>not by any regular lines or divisions, but every one pitching upon that 
<A NAME="910"></A>plot of ground which came next to hand, or best pleased his fancy; by which 
<A NAME="911"></A>haste and hurry in building, they constructed their city in narrow and 
<A NAME="912"></A>ill-designed lanes, and with houses huddled together one upon another; 
<A NAME="913"></A>for it is said that within the compass of the year the whole city was built 
<A NAME="914"></A>up anew, both in its public walls and private buildings. The persons, however, 
<A NAME="915"></A>appointed by Camillus to resume and mark out, in this general confusion, 
<A NAME="916"></A>all consecrated places, coming, in their way round the Palatium, to the 
<A NAME="917"></A>chapel of Mars, found the chapel itself indeed destroyed and burnt to the 
<A NAME="918"></A>ground, like everything else, by the barbarians; but whilst they were clearing 
<A NAME="919"></A>the place, and carrying away the rubbish, lit upon Romulus's augural staff, 
<A NAME="920"></A>buried under a great heap of ashes. This sort of staff is crooked at one 
<A NAME="921"></A>end, and is called lituus; they make use of it in quartering out the regions 
<A NAME="922"></A>of the heavens when engaged in divination from the flight of birds; Romulus, 
<A NAME="923"></A>who was himself a great diviner, made use of it. But when he disappeared 
<A NAME="924"></A>from the earth, the priests took his staff and kept it, as other holy things, 
<A NAME="925"></A>from the touch of man; and when they now found that, whereas all other 
<A NAME="926"></A>things were consumed, this staff had altogether escaped the flames, they 
<A NAME="927"></A>began to conceive happier hopes of Rome, and to augur from this token its 
<A NAME="928"></A>future everlasting safety.
<A NAME="929"></A><BR><BR>And now they had scarcely got a breathing time from their trouble, 
<A NAME="930"></A>when a new war came upon them; and the Aequians, Volscians, and Latins 
<A NAME="931"></A>all at once invaded their territories, and the Tuscans besieged Sutrium, 
<A NAME="932"></A>their confederate city. The military tribunes who commanded the army, and 
<A NAME="933"></A>were encamped about the hill Maecius, being closely besieged by the Latins, 
<A NAME="934"></A>and the camp in danger to be lost, sent to Rome, where Camillus was a third 
<A NAME="935"></A>time chosen dictator. Of this war two different accounts are given; I shall 
<A NAME="936"></A>begin with the more fabulous. They say that the Latins (whether out of 
<A NAME="937"></A>pretence, or real design to revive the ancient relationship of the two 
<A NAME="938"></A>nations) sent to desire of the Romans some free-born maidens in marriage; 
<A NAME="939"></A>that when the Romans were at a loss how to determine (for on one hand they 
<A NAME="940"></A>dreaded a war, having scarcely yet settled and recovered themselves, and 
<A NAME="941"></A>on the other side suspected that this asking of wives was, in plain terms, 
<A NAME="942"></A>nothing else but a demand for hostages, though covered over with the specious 
<A NAME="943"></A>name of intermarriage and alliance), a certain handmaid, by name Tutula, 
<A NAME="944"></A>or, as some call her, Philotis, persuaded the magistrates to send with 
<A NAME="945"></A>her some of the most youthful and best-looking maid-servants, in the bridal 
<A NAME="946"></A>dress of noble virgins, and leave the rest to her care and management; 
<A NAME="947"></A>that the magistrates, consenting, chose out as many as she thought necessary 
<A NAME="948"></A>for her purpose, and adorning them with gold and rich clothes, delivered 
<A NAME="949"></A>them to the Latins, who were encamped not far from the city; that at night 
<A NAME="950"></A>the rest stole away the enemy's swords, but Tutula or Philotis, getting 
<A NAME="951"></A>to the top of a wild fig-tree, and spreading out a thick woollen cloth 
<A NAME="952"></A>behind her, held out a torch towards Rome, which was the signal concerted 
<A NAME="953"></A>between her and the commanders, without the knowledge, however, of any 
<A NAME="954"></A>other of the citizens, which was the reason that their issuing out from 
<A NAME="955"></A>the city was tumultuous, the officers pushing their men on, and they calling 
<A NAME="956"></A>upon one another's names, and scarce able to bring themselves into order; 
<A NAME="957"></A>that setting upon the enemy's works, who either were asleep or expected 
<A NAME="958"></A>no such matter, they took the camp and destroyed most of them; and that 
<A NAME="959"></A>this was done on the Nones of July, which was then called Quintilis, and 
<A NAME="960"></A>that the feast that is observed on that day is a commemoration of what 
<A NAME="961"></A>was then done. For in it, first, they run out of the city in great crowds, 
<A NAME="962"></A>and call out aloud several familiar and common names, Caius, Marcus, Lucius, 
<A NAME="963"></A>and the like in representation of the way in which they called to one another 
<A NAME="964"></A>when they went out in such haste. In the next place, the maid-servants, 
<A NAME="965"></A>gaily dressed, run about, playing and jesting upon all they meet, and amongst 
<A NAME="966"></A>themselves, also, use a kind of skirmishing, to show they helped in the 
<A NAME="967"></A>conflict against the Latins; and while eating and drinking, they sit shaded 
<A NAME="968"></A>over with boughs of wild fig-tree, and the day they call Nonae Caprotinae, 
<A NAME="969"></A>as some think from that wild fig-tree on which the maid-servant held up 
<A NAME="970"></A>her torch, the Roman name for a wild fig-tree being caprificus. Others 
<A NAME="971"></A>refer most of what is said or done at this feast to the fate of Romulus, 
<A NAME="972"></A>for, on this day, he vanished outside the gates in a sudden darkness and 
<A NAME="973"></A>storm (some think it an eclipse of the sun), and from this the day was 
<A NAME="974"></A>called Nonae Caprotinae, the Latin for a goat being capra, and the place 
<A NAME="975"></A>where he disappeared having the name of Goat's Marsh, as is stated in his 
<A NAME="976"></A>life.
<A NAME="977"></A><BR><BR>But the general stream of writers prefer the other account of this 
<A NAME="978"></A>war, which they thus relate. Camillus, being the third time chosen dictator, 
<A NAME="979"></A>and learning that the army under the tribunes was besieged by the Latins 
<A NAME="980"></A>and Volscians, was constrained to arm, not only those under, but also those 
<A NAME="981"></A>over, the age of service; and taking a large circuit round the mountain 
<A NAME="982"></A>Maecius, undiscovered by the enemy, lodged his army on their rear, and 
<A NAME="983"></A>then by many fires gave notice of his arrival. The besieged, encouraged 
<A NAME="984"></A>by this, prepared to sally forth and join battle; but the Latins and Volscians, 
<A NAME="985"></A>fearing this exposure to an enemy on both sides, drew themselves within 
<A NAME="986"></A>their works, and fortified their camp with a strong palisade of trees on 
<A NAME="987"></A>every side, resolving to wait for more supplies from home, and expecting, 
<A NAME="988"></A>also, the assistance of the Tuscans, their confederates. Camillus, detecting 
<A NAME="989"></A>their object, and fearing to be reduced to the same position to which he 
<A NAME="990"></A>had brought them, namely, to be besieged himself, resolved to lose no time: 
<A NAME="991"></A>and finding their rampart was all of timber, and observing that a strong 
<A NAME="992"></A>wind constantly at sun-rising blew off from the mountains, after having 
<A NAME="993"></A>prepared a quantity of combustibles, about break of day he drew forth his 
<A NAME="994"></A>forces, commanding a part with their missiles to assault the enemy with 
<A NAME="995"></A>noise and shouting on the other quarter, whilst he, with those that were 
<A NAME="996"></A>to fling in the fire, went to that side of the enemy's camp to which the 
<A NAME="997"></A>wind usually blew, and there waited his opportunity. When the skirmish 
<A NAME="998"></A>was begun, and the sun risen, and a strong wind set in from the mountains, 
<A NAME="999"></A>he gave the signal of onset; and heaving in an infinite quantity of fiery 
<A NAME="1000"></A>matter, filled all their rampart with it, so that the flame being fed by 
<A NAME="1001"></A>the close timber and wooden palisades, went on and spread into all quarters. 
<A NAME="1002"></A>The Latins, having nothing ready to keep it off or extinguish it, when 
<A NAME="1003"></A>the camp was now almost full of fire, were driven back within a very small 
<A NAME="1004"></A>compass, and at last forced by necessity to come into their enemy's hands, 
<A NAME="1005"></A>who stood before the works ready armed and prepared to receive them; of 
<A NAME="1006"></A>these very few escaped, while those that stayed in the camp were all a 
<A NAME="1007"></A>prey to the fire, until the Romans, to gain the pillage, extinguished 
<A NAME="1008"></A>it.
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR><BR>These things performed, Camillus, leaving his son Lucius in the 
<A NAME="1010"></A>camp to guard the prisoners and secure the booty, passed into the enemy's 
<A NAME="1011"></A>country, where, having taken the city of the Aequians and reduced the Volscians 
<A NAME="1012"></A>to obedience, he then immediately led his army to Sutrium, not having heard 
<A NAME="1013"></A>what had befallen the Sutrians, but making haste to assist them, as if 
<A NAME="1014"></A>they were still in danger and besieged by the Tuscans. They, however, had 
<A NAME="1015"></A>already surrendered their city to their enemies, and destitute of all things, 
<A NAME="1016"></A>with nothing left but their clothes, met Camillus on the way, leading their 
<A NAME="1017"></A>wives and children, and bewailing their misfortune. Camillus himself was 
<A NAME="1018"></A>struck with compassion, and perceiving the soldiers weeping, and commiserating 
<A NAME="1019"></A>their case, while the Sutrians hung about and clung to them, resolved not 
<A NAME="1020"></A>to defer revenge, but that very day to lead his army to Sutrium; conjecturing 
<A NAME="1021"></A>that the enemy, having just taken a rich and plentiful city, without an 
<A NAME="1022"></A>enemy left within it, nor any from without to be expected, would be found 
<A NAME="1023"></A>abandoned to enjoyment and unguarded. Neither did his opinion fail him; 
<A NAME="1024"></A>he not only passed through their country without discovery, but came up 
<A NAME="1025"></A>to their very gates and possessed himself of the walls, not a man being 
<A NAME="1026"></A>left to guard them, but their whole army scattered about in the houses, 
<A NAME="1027"></A>drinking and making merry. Nay, when at last they did perceive that the 
<A NAME="1028"></A>enemy had seized the city, they were so overloaded with meat and wine, 
<A NAME="1029"></A>that few were able so much as to endeavour to escape, but either waited 
<A NAME="1030"></A>shamefully for their death within doors, or surrendered themselves to the 
<A NAME="1031"></A>conqueror. Thus the city of the Sutrians was twice taken in one day; and 
<A NAME="1032"></A>they who were in possession lost it, and they who had lost regained it, 
<A NAME="1033"></A>alike by the means of Camillus. For all which actions he received a triumph, 
<A NAME="1034"></A>which brought him no less honour and reputation than the two former ones; 
<A NAME="1035"></A>for those citizens who before most regarded him with an evil eye, and ascribed 
<A NAME="1036"></A>his successes to a certain luck rather than real merit, were compelled 
<A NAME="1037"></A>by these last acts of his to allow the whole honour to his great abilities 
<A NAME="1038"></A>and energy.
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR><BR>Of all the adversaries and enviers of his glory, Marcus Manlius 
<A NAME="1040"></A>was the most distinguished, he who first drove back the Gauls when they 
<A NAME="1041"></A>made their night attack upon the Capitol, and who for that reason had been 
<A NAME="1042"></A>named Capitolinus. This man, affecting the first place in the commonwealth, 
<A NAME="1043"></A>and not able by noble ways to outdo Camillus's reputation, took that ordinary 
<A NAME="1044"></A>course towards usurpation of absolute power, namely, to gain the multitude, 
<A NAME="1045"></A>those of them especially that were in debt; defending some by pleading 
<A NAME="1046"></A>their causes against their creditors, rescuing others by force, and not 
<A NAME="1047"></A>suffering the law to proceed against them; insomuch that in a short time 
<A NAME="1048"></A>he got great numbers of indigent people about him, whose tumults and uproars 
<A NAME="1049"></A>in the forum struck terror into the principal citizens. After that Quintius 
<A NAME="1050"></A>Capitolinus, who was made dictator to suppress these disorders, had committed 
<A NAME="1051"></A>Manlius to prison, the people immediately changed their apparel, a thing 
<A NAME="1052"></A>never done but in great and public calamities, and the senate, fearing 
<A NAME="1053"></A>some tumult, ordered him to be released. He, however, when set at liberty, 
<A NAME="1054"></A>changed not his course, but was rather the more insolent in his proceedings, 
<A NAME="1055"></A>filling the whole city with faction and sedition. They chose, therefore, 
<A NAME="1056"></A>Camillus again military tribune; and a day being appointed for Manlius 
<A NAME="1057"></A>to answer to his charge, the prospect from the place where his trial was 
<A NAME="1058"></A>held proved a great impediment to his accusers, for the very spot where 
<A NAME="1059"></A>Manlius by night fought with the Gauls overlooked the forum from the Capitol, 
<A NAME="1060"></A>so that, stretching forth his hands that way, and weeping, he called to 
<A NAME="1061"></A>their remembrance his past actions, raising compassion in all that beheld 
<A NAME="1062"></A>him. Insomuch that the judges were at a loss what to do, and several times 
<A NAME="1063"></A>adjourned the trial, unwilling to acquit him of the crime, which was sufficiently 
<A NAME="1064"></A>proved, and yet unable to execute the law while his noble action remained, 
<A NAME="1065"></A>as it were, before their eyes. Camillus, considering this, transferred 
<A NAME="1066"></A>the court outside the gate to the Peteline Grove, from whence there is 
<A NAME="1067"></A>no prospect of the Capitol. Here his accuser went on with his charge, and 
<A NAME="1068"></A>his judges were capable of remembering and duly resenting his guilty deeds. 
<A NAME="1069"></A>He was convicted, carried to the Capitol, and flung headlong from the rock; 
<A NAME="1070"></A>so that one and the same spot was thus the witness of his greatest glory, 
<A NAME="1071"></A>and monument of his most unfortunate end. The Romans, besides, razed his 
<A NAME="1072"></A>house, and built there a temple to the goddess they call Moneta, ordaining 
<A NAME="1073"></A>for the future that none of the patrician order should ever dwell on the 
<A NAME="1074"></A>Capitoline.
<A NAME="1075"></A><BR><BR>And now Camillus, being called to his sixth tribuneship, desired 
<A NAME="1076"></A>to be excused, as being aged, and perhaps not
