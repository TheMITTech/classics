<BR>(died 359 B.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>The first Artaxerxes, among all the kings of Persia the most remarkable 
<A NAME="11"></A>for a gentle and noble spirit, was surnamed the Long-handed, his right 
<A NAME="12"></A>hand being longer than his left, and was the son of Xerxes. The second, 
<A NAME="13"></A>whose story I am now writing, who had the surname of the Mindful, was the 
<A NAME="14"></A>grandson of the former, by his daughter Parysatis, who brought Darius four 
<A NAME="15"></A>sons, the eldest Artaxerxes, the next Cyrus, and two younger than these, 
<A NAME="16"></A>Ostanes and Oxathres. Cyrus took his name of the ancient Cyrus, as he, 
<A NAME="17"></A>they say, had his from the sun, which, in the Persian language, is called 
<A NAME="18"></A>Cyrus. Artaxerxes was at first called Arsicas; Dinon says Oarses; but it 
<A NAME="19"></A>is utterly improbable that Ctesias (however otherwise he may have filled 
<A NAME="20"></A>his books with a perfect farrago of incredible and senseless fables) should 
<A NAME="21"></A>be ignorant of the name of the king with whom he lived as his physician, 
<A NAME="22"></A>attending upon himself, his wife, his mother, and his 
<A NAME="23"></A>children.
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR>Cyrus, from his earliest youth, showed something of a headstrong 
<A NAME="25"></A>and vehement character; Artaxerxes, on the other side, was gentler in everything, 
<A NAME="26"></A>and of a nature more yielding and soft in its action. He married a beautiful 
<A NAME="27"></A>and virtuous wife, at the desire of his parents, but kept her as expressly 
<A NAME="28"></A>against their wishes. For King Darius, having put her brother to death, 
<A NAME="29"></A>was purposing likewise to destroy her. But Arsicas, throwing himself at 
<A NAME="30"></A>his mother's feet, by many tears, at last, with much ado, persuaded her 
<A NAME="31"></A>that they should neither put her to death nor divorce her from him. However, 
<A NAME="32"></A>Cyrus, was his mother's favourite, and the son whom she most desired to 
<A NAME="33"></A>settle in the throne. And therefore, his father Darius now lying ill, he, 
<A NAME="34"></A>being sent for from the sea to the court, set out thence with full hopes 
<A NAME="35"></A>that by her means he was to be declared the successor to the kingdom. For 
<A NAME="36"></A>Parysatis had the specious plea in his behalf, which Xerxes on the advice 
<A NAME="37"></A>of Demaratus had of old made use of, that she had borne him Arsicas when 
<A NAME="38"></A>he was a subject, but Cyrus, when a king. Notwithstanding, she prevailed 
<A NAME="39"></A>not with Darius, but the eldest son, Arsicas, was proclaimed king, his 
<A NAME="40"></A>name being changed into Artaxerxes; and Cyrus remained satrap of Lydia, 
<A NAME="41"></A>and commander in the maritime provinces.
<A NAME="42"></A><BR><BR>It was not long after the decease of Darius that the king, his 
<A NAME="43"></A>successor, went to Pasargadae, to have the ceremony of his inauguration 
<A NAME="44"></A>consummated by the Persian priests. There is a temple dedicated to a warlike 
<A NAME="45"></A>goddess, whom one might liken to Minerva, into which when the royal person 
<A NAME="46"></A>to be initiated has passed, he must strip himself of his own robe, and 
<A NAME="47"></A>put on that which Cyrus the first wore before he was king; then, having 
<A NAME="48"></A>devoured a frail of figs, he must eat turpentine, and drink a cup of sour 
<A NAME="49"></A>milk. To which if they superadd any other rites, it is unknown to any but 
<A NAME="50"></A>those that are present at them. Now Artaxerxes being about to address himself 
<A NAME="51"></A>to this solemnity, Tisaphernes came to him, bringing a certain priest, 
<A NAME="52"></A>who, having trained up Cyrus in his youth in the established discipline 
<A NAME="53"></A>of Persia, and having taught him the Magian philosophy, was likely to be 
<A NAME="54"></A>as much disappointed as any man that his pupil did not succeed to the throne. 
<A NAME="55"></A>And for that reason his veracity was the less questioned when he charged 
<A NAME="56"></A>Cyrus as though he had been about to lie in wait for the king in the temple, 
<A NAME="57"></A>and to assault and assassinate him as he was putting off his garment. Some 
<A NAME="58"></A>affirm that he was apprehended upon this impeachment, others that he had 
<A NAME="59"></A>entered the temple and was pointed out there, as he lay lurking by the 
<A NAME="60"></A>priest. But as he was on the point of being put to death, his mother clasped 
<A NAME="61"></A>him in her arms, and, entwining him with the tresses of her hair, joined 
<A NAME="62"></A>his neck close to her own, and by her bitter lamentation and intercession 
<A NAME="63"></A>to Artaxerxes for him, succeeded in saving his life; and sent him away 
<A NAME="64"></A>again to the sea and to his former province. This, however, could no longer 
<A NAME="65"></A>content him; nor did he so well remember his delivery as his arrest, his 
<A NAME="66"></A>resentment for which made him more eagerly desirous of the kingdom than 
<A NAME="67"></A>before.
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR>Some say that he revolted from his brother, because he had not 
<A NAME="69"></A>a revenue allowed him sufficient for his daily meals; but this is on the 
<A NAME="70"></A>face of it absurd. For had he had nothing else, yet he had a mother ready 
<A NAME="71"></A>to supply him with whatever he could desire out of her own means. But the 
<A NAME="72"></A>great number of soldiers who were hired from all quarters and maintained, 
<A NAME="73"></A>as Xenophon informs us, for his service, by his friends and connections, 
<A NAME="74"></A>is in itself a sufficient proof of his riches. He did not assemble them 
<A NAME="75"></A>together in a body, desiring as yet to conceal his enterprise; but he had 
<A NAME="76"></A>agents everywhere, enlisting foreign soldiers upon various pretences; and, 
<A NAME="77"></A>in the meantime, Parysatis, who was with the king, did her best to put 
<A NAME="78"></A>aside all suspicions, and Cyrus himself always wrote in a humble and dutiful 
<A NAME="79"></A>manner to him, sometimes soliciting favour, and sometimes making countercharges 
<A NAME="80"></A>against Tisaphernes, as if his jealousy and contest had been wholly with 
<A NAME="81"></A>him. Moreover, there was a certain natural dilatoriness in the king, which 
<A NAME="82"></A>was taken by many for clemency. And, indeed, in the beginning of his reign, 
<A NAME="83"></A>he did seem really to emulate the gentleness of the first Artaxerxes, being 
<A NAME="84"></A>very accessible in his person, and liberal to a fault in the distribution 
<A NAME="85"></A>of honours and favours. Even in his punishments, no contumely or vindictive 
<A NAME="86"></A>pleasure could be seen; and those who offered him presents were as much 
<A NAME="87"></A>pleased with his manner of accepting, as were those who received gifts 
<A NAME="88"></A>from him with his graciousness and amiability in giving them. Nor truly 
<A NAME="89"></A>was there anything, however inconsiderable, given him, which he did not 
<A NAME="90"></A>deign kindly to accept of; insomuch that when one Omises had presented 
<A NAME="91"></A>him with a very large pomegranate, "By city Mithras," said he, "this man, 
<A NAME="92"></A>were he intrusted with it, would turn a small city into a great 
<A NAME="93"></A>one."
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR>Once when some were offering him one thing, some another, as he 
<A NAME="95"></A>was on a progress, a certain poor labourer, having got nothing at hand 
<A NAME="96"></A>to bring him, ran to the river side, and, taking up water in his hands, 
<A NAME="97"></A>offered it to him; with which Artaxerxes was so well pleased that he sent 
<A NAME="98"></A>him a goblet of gold and a thousand darics. To Euclidas, the Lacedaemonian, 
<A NAME="99"></A>who had made a number of bold and arrogant speeches to him, he sent word 
<A NAME="100"></A>by one of his officers. "You have leave to say what you please to me, and 
<A NAME="101"></A>I, you should remember, may both say and do what I please to you." Teribazus 
<A NAME="102"></A>once, when they were hunting, came up and pointed out to the king that 
<A NAME="103"></A>his royal robe was torn; the king asked him what he wished him to do; and 
<A NAME="104"></A>when Teribazus replied, "May it please you to put on another and give me 
<A NAME="105"></A>that," the king did so, saying withal, "I give it you, Teribazus, but I 
<A NAME="106"></A>charge you not to wear it." He, little regarding the injunction, being 
<A NAME="107"></A>not a bad, but a lightheaded, thoughtless man, immediately the king took 
<A NAME="108"></A>it off, put it on, and bedecked himself further with royal golden necklaces 
<A NAME="109"></A>and women's ornaments, to the great scandal of everybody, the thing being 
<A NAME="110"></A>quite unlawful. But the king laughed and told him, "You have my leave to 
<A NAME="111"></A>wear the trinkets as a woman, and the robe of state as a fool." And whereas 
<A NAME="112"></A>none usually sat down to eat with the king besides his mother and his wedded 
<A NAME="113"></A>wife, the former being placed above, the other below him, Artaxerxes invited 
<A NAME="114"></A>also to his table his two younger brothers, Ostanes and Oxathres. But what 
<A NAME="115"></A>was the most popular thing of all among the Persians was the sight of his 
<A NAME="116"></A>wife Statira's chariot, which always appeared with its curtains down, allowing 
<A NAME="117"></A>her country-women to salute and approach her, which made the queen a great 
<A NAME="118"></A>favourite with the people.
<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR>Yet busy, factious men, that delighted in change, professed it 
<A NAME="120"></A>to be their opinion that the times needed Cyrus, a man of great spirit, 
<A NAME="121"></A>an excellent warrior, and a lover of his friends, and that the largeness 
<A NAME="122"></A>of their empire absolutely required a bold and enterprising prince. Cyrus, 
<A NAME="123"></A>then, not only relying upon those of his own province near the sea, but 
<A NAME="124"></A>upon many of those in the upper countries near the king, commenced the 
<A NAME="125"></A>war against him. He wrote to the Lacedaemonians, bidding them come to his 
<A NAME="126"></A>assistance and supply him with men, assuring them that to those who came 
<A NAME="127"></A>to him on foot he would give horses, and to the horsemen chariots; that 
<A NAME="128"></A>upon those who had farms he would bestow villages, and those who were lords 
<A NAME="129"></A>of villages he would make so of cities; and that those who would be his 
<A NAME="130"></A>soldiers should receive their pay, not by count, but by weight. And among 
<A NAME="131"></A>many other high praises of himself, he said he had the stronger soul; was 
<A NAME="132"></A>more a philosopher and a better Magian; and could drink and bear more wine 
<A NAME="133"></A>than his brother, who, as he averred, was such a coward and so little like 
<A NAME="134"></A>a man, that he could neither sit his horse in hunting nor his throne in 
<A NAME="135"></A>time of danger. The Lacedaemonians, his letter being read, sent a staff 
<A NAME="136"></A>to Clearchus, commanding him to obey Cyrus in all things. So Cyrus marched 
<A NAME="137"></A>towards the king, having under his conduct a numerous host of barbarians, 
<A NAME="138"></A>and but little less than thirteen thousand stipendiary Grecians; alleging 
<A NAME="139"></A>first one cause, then another, for his expedition. Yet the true reason 
<A NAME="140"></A>lay not long concealed, but Tisaphernes went to the king in person to declare 
<A NAME="141"></A>it. Thereupon, the court was all in an uproar and tumult, the queen-mother 
<A NAME="142"></A>bearing almost the whole blame of the enterprise, and her retainers being 
<A NAME="143"></A>suspected and accused. Above all, Statira angered her by bewailing the 
<A NAME="144"></A>war and passionately demanding where were now the pledges and the intercession 
<A NAME="145"></A>which saved the life of him that conspired against his brother; "to the 
<A NAME="146"></A>end," she said, "that he might plunge us all into war and trouble." For 
<A NAME="147"></A>which words Parysatis hating Statira, and being naturally implacable and 
<A NAME="148"></A>savage in her anger and revenge, consulted how she might destroy her. But 
<A NAME="149"></A>since Dinon tells us that her purpose took effect in the time of the war, 
<A NAME="150"></A>and Ctesias says it was after it, I shall keep the story for the place 
<A NAME="151"></A>to which the latter assigns it, as it is very unlikely that he, who was 
<A NAME="152"></A>actually present, should not know the time when it happened, and there 
<A NAME="153"></A>was no motive to induce him designedly to misplace its date in his narrative 
<A NAME="154"></A>of it, though it is not infrequent with him in his history to make excursions 
<A NAME="155"></A>from truth into mere fiction and romance.
<A NAME="156"></A><BR><BR>As Cyrus was upon the march, rumours and reports were brought him, 
<A NAME="157"></A>as though the king still deliberated, and were not minded to fight and 
<A NAME="158"></A>presently to join battle with him; but to wait in the heart of his kingdom 
<A NAME="159"></A>until his forces should have come in thither from all parts of his dominions. 
<A NAME="160"></A>He had cut a trench through the plain ten fathoms in breadth, and as many 
<A NAME="161"></A>in depth the length of it being no less than four hundred furlongs, he 
<A NAME="162"></A>be allowed Cyrus to pass across it, and to advance almost to the city of 
<A NAME="163"></A>Babylon. Then Teribazus, as the report goes, was the first that had the 
<A NAME="164"></A>boldness to tell the king that he ought not to avoid the conflict, nor 
<A NAME="165"></A>to abandon Media, Babylon, and even Susa, and hide himself in Persis, when 
<A NAME="166"></A>all the while he had an army many times over more numerous than his enemies, 
<A NAME="167"></A>and an infinite company of governors and captains that were better soldiers 
<A NAME="168"></A>and politicians than Cyrus. So at last he resolved to fight, as soon as 
<A NAME="169"></A>it was possible for him. Making, therefore, his first appearance, all on 
<A NAME="170"></A>a sudden, at the head of nine hundred thousand well-marshalled men, he 
<A NAME="171"></A>so startled and surprised the enemy, who with the confidence of contempt 
<A NAME="172"></A>were marching on their way in no order, and with their arms not ready for 
<A NAME="173"></A>use, that Cyrus, in the midst of such noise and tumult, was scarcely able 
<A NAME="174"></A>to form them for battle. Moreover, the very manner in which he led on his 
<A NAME="175"></A>men, silently and slowly, made the Grecians stand amazed at his good discipline; 
<A NAME="176"></A>who had expected irregular shouting and leaping, much confusion and separation 
<A NAME="177"></A>between one body of men and another, in so vast a multitude of troops. 
<A NAME="178"></A>He also placed the choicest of his armed chariots in the front of his own 
<A NAME="179"></A>phalanx over against the Grecian troops, that a violent charge with these 
<A NAME="180"></A>might cut open their ranks before they closed with them.
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR>But as this battle is described by many historians, and Xenophon 
<A NAME="182"></A>in particular as good as shows it us by eyesight, not as a past event, 
<A NAME="183"></A>but as a present action, and by his vivid account makes his hearers feel 
<A NAME="184"></A>all the passions and join in all the dangers of it, it would be folly in 
<A NAME="185"></A>me to give any larger account of it than barely to mention any things omitted 
<A NAME="186"></A>by him which yet deserve to be recorded. The place, then, in which the 
<A NAME="187"></A>two armies were drawn out is called Cunaxa, being about five hundred furlongs 
<A NAME="188"></A>distant from Babylon. And here Clearchus beseeching Cyrus before the fight 
<A NAME="189"></A>to retire behind the combatants, and not expose himself to hazard, they 
<A NAME="190"></A>say he replied, "What is this, Clearchus? Would you have me, who aspire 
<A NAME="191"></A>to empire, show myself unworthy of it?" But if Cyrus committed a great 
<A NAME="192"></A>fault in entering headlong into the midst of danger, and not paying any 
<A NAME="193"></A>regard to his own safety, Clearchus was as much to blame, if not more, 
<A NAME="194"></A>in refusing to lead the Greeks against the main body of the enemy, where 
<A NAME="195"></A>the king stood, and in keeping his right wing close to the river, for fear 
<A NAME="196"></A>of being surrounded. For if he wanted, above all other things, to be safe, 
<A NAME="197"></A>and considered it his first object to sleep in a whole skin, it had been 
<A NAME="198"></A>his best way not to have stirred from home. But, after marching in arms 
<A NAME="199"></A>ten thousand furlongs from the sea-coast, simply on his choosing, for the 
<A NAME="200"></A>purpose of placing Cyrus on the throne, to look about and select a position 
<A NAME="201"></A>which would enable him, not to preserve him under whose pay and conduct 
<A NAME="202"></A>he was, but himself to engage with more ease and security, seemed much 
<A NAME="203"></A>like one that through fear of present dangers had abandoned the purpose 
<A NAME="204"></A>of his actions, and been false to the design of his expedition. For it 
<A NAME="205"></A>is evident from the very event of the battle that none of those who were 
<A NAME="206"></A>in array around the king's person could have stood the shock of the Grecian 
<A NAME="207"></A>charge; and had they been beaten out of the field, and Artaxerxes either 
<A NAME="208"></A>fled or fallen, Cyrus would have gained by the victory, not only safety, 
<A NAME="209"></A>but a crown. And, therefore, Clearchus by his caution must be considered 
<A NAME="210"></A>more to blame for the result in the destruction of the life and fortune 
<A NAME="211"></A>of Cyrus, than he by his heat and rashness. For had the king made it his 
<A NAME="212"></A>business to discover a place, where having posted the Grecians, he might 
<A NAME="213"></A>encounter them with the least hazard, he would never have found out any 
<A NAME="214"></A>other but that which was most remote from himself and those near him; of 
<A NAME="215"></A>his defeat in which he was insensible, and, though Clearchus had the victory, 
<A NAME="216"></A>yet Cyrus could not know of it, and could take no advantage of it before 
<A NAME="217"></A>his fall. Cyrus knew well enough what was expedient to be done, and commanded 
<A NAME="218"></A>Clearchus with his men to take their place in the centre. Clearchus replied 
<A NAME="219"></A>that he would take care to have all arranged as was best, and then spoiled 
<A NAME="220"></A>all.
<A NAME="221"></A><BR><BR>For the Grecians, where they were, defeated the barbarians till 
<A NAME="222"></A>they were weary, and chased them successfully a very great way. But Cyrus 
<A NAME="223"></A>being mounted upon a noble but a headstrong and hard-mouthed horse, bearing 
<A NAME="224"></A>the name, as Ctesias tells us, of Pasacas, Artagerses, the leader of the 
<A NAME="225"></A>Cadusians, galloped up to him, crying aloud, "O most unjust and senseless 
<A NAME="226"></A>of men, who are the disgrace of the honoured name of Cyrus, are you come 
<A NAME="227"></A>here leading the wicked Greeks on a wicked journey, to plunder the good 
<A NAME="228"></A>things of the Persians, and this with the intent of slaying your lord and 
<A NAME="229"></A>brother, the master of ten thousand times ten thousand servants that are 
<A NAME="230"></A>better men than you? as you shall see this instant; for you shall lose 
<A NAME="231"></A>your head here, before you look upon the face of the king." Which when 
<A NAME="232"></A>he had said, he cast his javelin at him. But his coat of mail stoutly repelled 
<A NAME="233"></A>it, and Cyrus was not wounded; yet the stroke falling heavy upon him, he 
<A NAME="234"></A>reeled under it. Then Artagerses turning his horse, Cyrus threw his weapon, 
<A NAME="235"></A>and sent the head of it through his neck near the shoulder bone. So that 
<A NAME="236"></A>it is almost universally agreed to by all the authors that Artagerses was 
<A NAME="237"></A>slain by him.
<A NAME="238"></A><BR><BR>But as to the death of Cyrus, since Xenophon, as being himself 
<A NAME="239"></A>no eyewitness of it, has stated it simply and in few words, it may not 
<A NAME="240"></A>be amiss perhaps to run over on the one hand what Dinon, and on the other, 
<A NAME="241"></A>what Ctesias has said of it.
<A NAME="242"></A><BR><BR>Dinon then affirms that, after the death of Artagerses, Cyrus, 
<A NAME="243"></A>furiously attacking the guard of Artaxerxes, wounded the king's horse, 
<A NAME="244"></A>and so dismounted him, and when Teribazus had quickly lifted him up upon 
<A NAME="245"></A>another, and said to him, "O king, remember this day, which is not one 
<A NAME="246"></A>to be forgotten," Cyrus, again spurring up his horse, struck down Artaxerxes. 
<A NAME="247"></A>But at the third assault the king being enraged, and saying to those near 
<A NAME="248"></A>him that death was more eligible, made up to Cyrus, who furiously and blindly 
<A NAME="249"></A>rushed in the face of the weapons opposed to him. So the king struck him 
<A NAME="250"></A>with a javelin, as likewise did those that were about him. And thus Cyrus 
<A NAME="251"></A>falls, as some say, by the hand of the king; as others by the dart of a 
<A NAME="252"></A>Carian, to whom Artaxerxes for a reward of his achievement gave the privilege 
<A NAME="253"></A>of carrying ever after a golden cock upon his spear before the first ranks 
<A NAME="254"></A>of the army in all expeditions. For the Persians call the men of Caria 
<A NAME="255"></A>cocks, because of the crests with which they adorn their 
<A NAME="256"></A>helmets.
<A NAME="257"></A><BR><BR>But the account of Ctesias, to put it shortly, omitting many details, 
<A NAME="258"></A>is as follows: Cyrus, after the death of Artagerses, rode up against the 
<A NAME="259"></A>king, as he did against him, neither exchanging a word with the other. 
<A NAME="260"></A>But Ariaeus, Cyrus's friend, was beforehand with him, and darted first 
<A NAME="261"></A>at the king, yet wounded him not. Then the king cast his lance at his brother, 
<A NAME="262"></A>but missed him, though he both hit and slew Satiphernes, a noble man and 
<A NAME="263"></A>a faithful friend to Cyrus. Then Cyrus directed his lance against the king, 
<A NAME="264"></A>and pierced his breast with it quite through his armour, two inches deep, 
<A NAME="265"></A>so that he fell from his horse with the stroke. At which those that attended 
<A NAME="266"></A>him being put to flight and disorder, he, rising with a few, among whom 
<A NAME="267"></A>was Ctesias, and making his way to a little hill not far off, rested himself. 
<A NAME="268"></A>But Cyrus, who was in the thick enemy, was carried off a great way by the 
<A NAME="269"></A>wildness of his horse, the darkness which was now coming on making it hard 
<A NAME="270"></A>for them to know him, and for his followers to find him. However, being 
<A NAME="271"></A>made elate with victory, and full of confidence and force, he passed through 
<A NAME="272"></A>them, crying out, and that more than once, in the Persian language, "Clear 
<A NAME="273"></A>the way, villains, clear the way;" which they indeed did, throwing themselves 
<A NAME="274"></A>down at his feet. But his tiara dropped off his head, and a young Persian, 
<A NAME="275"></A>by name Mithridates, running by, struck a dart into one of his temples 
<A NAME="276"></A>near his eye, not knowing who he was; out of which wound much blood gushed, 
<A NAME="277"></A>so that Cyrus, swooning and senseless, fell off his horse. The horse escaped, 
<A NAME="278"></A>and ran about the field; but the companion of Mithridates took the trappings 
<A NAME="279"></A>which fell off, soaked with blood. And as Cyrus slowly began to come to 
<A NAME="280"></A>himself, some eunuchs who were there tried to put him on another horse, 
<A NAME="281"></A>and so convey him safe away. And when he was not able to ride, and desired 
<A NAME="282"></A>to walk on his feet, they led and supported him, being indeed dizzy in 
<A NAME="283"></A>the head and reeling, but convinced of his being victorious, hearing, as 
<A NAME="284"></A>he went, the fugitives saluting Cyrus as king, and praying for grace and 
<A NAME="285"></A>mercy. In the meantime, some wretched, poverty-stricken Caunians, who in 
<A NAME="286"></A>some pitiful employment as camp followers had accompanied the king's army, 
<A NAME="287"></A>by chance joined these attendants of Cyrus, supposing them to be of their 
<A NAME="288"></A>own party. But when, after a while, they made out that their coats over 
<A NAME="289"></A>their breastplates were red, whereas all the king's people wore white ones, 
<A NAME="290"></A>they knew that they were enemies. One of them, therefore, not dreaming 
<A NAME="291"></A>that it was Cyrus, ventured to strike him behind with a dart. The vein 
<A NAME="292"></A>under the knee was cut open, and Cyrus fell, and at the same time struck 
<A NAME="293"></A>his wounded temple against a stone, and so died. Thus runs Ctesias's account, 
<A NAME="294"></A>tardily, with the slowness of a blunt weapon effecting the victim's 
<A NAME="295"></A>death.
<A NAME="296"></A><BR><BR>When he was now dead, Artasyras, the king's eye, passed by on horseback, 
<A NAME="297"></A>and, having observed the eunuchs lamenting, he asked the most trusty of 
<A NAME="298"></A>them, "Who is this, Pariscas, whom you sit here deploring?" He replied, 
<A NAME="299"></A>"Do not you see, O Artasyras, that it is my master, Cyrus?" Then Artasyras 
<A NAME="300"></A>wondering, bade the eunuch be of good cheer, and keep the dead body safe. 
<A NAME="301"></A>And going in all haste to Artaxerxes, who had now given up all hope of 
<A NAME="302"></A>his affairs, and was in great suffering also with his thirst and his wound, 
<A NAME="303"></A>he with much joy assured him that he had seen Cyrus dead. Upon this, at 
<A NAME="304"></A>first, he set out to go in person to the place, and commanded Artasyras 
<A NAME="305"></A>to conduct him where he lay. But when there was a great noise made about 
<A NAME="306"></A>the Greeks, who were said to be in full pursuit, conquering and carrying 
<A NAME="307"></A>all before them, he thought it best to send a number of persons to see; 
<A NAME="308"></A>and accordingly thirty men went with torches in their hands. Meantime, 
<A NAME="309"></A>as he seemed to be almost at the point of dying from thirst, his eunuch 
<A NAME="310"></A>Satibarzanes ran about seeking drink for him; for the place had no water 
<A NAME="311"></A>in it and he was at a good distance from his camp. After a long search 
<A NAME="312"></A>he at last met one of those poor Caunian camp-followers, who had in a wretched 
<A NAME="313"></A>skin about four pints of foul and stinking water, which he took and gave 
<A NAME="314"></A>to the king; and when he had drunk all off, he asked him if he did not 
<A NAME="315"></A>dislike the water; but he declared by all the gods that he never so much 
<A NAME="316"></A>relished either wine, or water out of the lightest or purest stream. "And 
<A NAME="317"></A>therefore," said he, "if I fail myself to discover and reward him who gave 
<A NAME="318"></A>it to you, I beg of heaven to make him rich and prosperous."
<A NAME="319"></A><BR><BR>Just after this, came back the thirty messengers, with joy and 
<A NAME="320"></A>triumph in their looks, bringing him the tidings of his unexpected fortune. 
<A NAME="321"></A>And now he was also encouraged by the number of soldiers that again began 
<A NAME="322"></A>to flock in and gather about him; so that he presently descended into the 
<A NAME="323"></A>plain with many lights and flambeaux round about him. And when he had come 
<A NAME="324"></A>near the dead body, and, according to a certain law of the Persians, the 
<A NAME="325"></A>right hand and head had been lopped off from the trunk, he gave orders 
<A NAME="326"></A>that the latter should be brought to him, and, grasping the hair of it, 
<A NAME="327"></A>which was long and bushy, he showed it to those who were still uncertain 
<A NAME="328"></A>and disposed to fly. They were amazed at it, and did him homage; so that 
<A NAME="329"></A>there were presently seventy thousand of them got about him, and entered 
<A NAME="330"></A>the camp again with him. He had led out to the fight, as Ctesias affirms, 
<A NAME="331"></A>four hundred thousand men. But Dinon and Xenophon aver that there were 
<A NAME="332"></A>many more than forty myriads actually engaged. As to the number of the 
<A NAME="333"></A>slain, as the catalogue of them was given up to Artaxerxes, Ctesias says, 
<A NAME="334"></A>they were nine thousand, but that they appeared to him no fewer than twenty 
<A NAME="335"></A>thousand. Thus far there is something to be said on both sides. But it 
<A NAME="336"></A>is a flagrant untruth on the part of Ctesias to say that he was sent along 
<A NAME="337"></A>with Phalinus the Zacynthian and some others to the Grecians. For Xenophon 
<A NAME="338"></A>knew well enough that Ctesias was resident at court; for he makes mention 
<A NAME="339"></A>of him, and had evidently met with his writings. And, therefore, had he 
<A NAME="340"></A>come, and been deputed the interpreter of such momentous words, Xenophon 
<A NAME="341"></A>surely would not have struck his name out of the embassy to mention only 
<A NAME="342"></A>Phalinus. But Ctesias, as is evident, being excessively vainglorious and 
<A NAME="343"></A>no less a favourer of the Lacedaemonians and Clearchus, never fails to 
<A NAME="344"></A>assume to himself some province in his narrative, taking opportunity, in 
<A NAME="345"></A>these situations, to introduce abundant high praise of Clearchus and 
<A NAME="346"></A>Sparta.
<A NAME="347"></A><BR><BR>When the battle was over, Artaxerxes sent goodly and magnificent 
<A NAME="348"></A>gifts to the son of Artagerses, whom Cyrus slew. He conferred likewise 
<A NAME="349"></A>high honours upon Ctesias and others, and, having found out the Caunian 
<A NAME="350"></A>who gave him the bottle of water, he made him- a poor, obscure man- a rich 
<A NAME="351"></A>and an honourable person. As for the punishments he inflicted upon delinquents, 
<A NAME="352"></A>there was a kind of harmony betwixt them and the crimes. He gave order 
<A NAME="353"></A>that one Arbaces, a Mede, that had fled in the fight to Cyrus and again 
<A NAME="354"></A>at his fall had come back, should, as a mark that he was considered a dastardly 
<A NAME="355"></A>and effeminate, not a dangerous or treasonable man, have a common harlot 
<A NAME="356"></A>set upon his back, and carry her about for a whole day in the market-place. 
<A NAME="357"></A>Another, besides that he had deserted to them, having falsely vaunted that 
<A NAME="358"></A>he had killed two of the rebels, he decreed that three needles should be 
<A NAME="359"></A>struck through his tongue. And both supposing that with his own hand he 
<A NAME="360"></A>had cut off Cyrus, and being willing that all men should think and say 
<A NAME="361"></A>so, he sent rich presents to Mithridates, who first wounded him, and charged 
<A NAME="362"></A>those by whom he conveyed the gifts to him to tell him, that "the king 
<A NAME="363"></A>has honoured you with these his favours, because you found and brought 
<A NAME="364"></A>him the horse-trappings of Cyrus."
<A NAME="365"></A><BR><BR>The Carian, also, from whose wound in the ham Cyrus died, suing 
<A NAME="366"></A>for his reward, he commanded those that brought it him to say that "the 
<A NAME="367"></A>king presents you with this as a second remuneration of the good news told 
<A NAME="368"></A>him; for first Artasyras, and, next to him, you assured him of the decease 
<A NAME="369"></A>of Cyrus." Mithridates retired without complaint, though not without resentment. 
<A NAME="370"></A>But the unfortunate Carian was fool enough to give way to a natural infirmity. 
<A NAME="371"></A>For being ravished with the sight of the princely gifts that were before 
<A NAME="372"></A>him, and being tempted thereupon to challenge and aspire to things above 
<A NAME="373"></A>him, he deigned not to accept the king's present as a reward for good news, 
<A NAME="374"></A>but indignantly crying out and appealing to witnesses, he protested that 
<A NAME="375"></A>he, and none but he, had killed Cyrus, and that he was unjustly deprived 
<A NAME="376"></A>of the glory. These words, when they came to his ear, much offended the 
<A NAME="377"></A>king, so that forthwith he sentenced him to be beheaded. But the queen 
<A NAME="378"></A>mother, being in the king's presence, said, "Let not the king so lightly 
<A NAME="379"></A>discharge this pernicious Carian; let him receive from me the fitting punishment 
<A NAME="380"></A>of what he dares to say." So when the king had consigned him over to Parysatis, 
<A NAME="381"></A>she charged the executioners to take up the man, and stretch him upon the 
<A NAME="382"></A>rack for ten days, then, tearing out his eyes, to drop molten brass into 
<A NAME="383"></A>his ears till he expired.
<A NAME="384"></A><BR><BR>Mithridates, also, within a short time after, miserably perished 
<A NAME="385"></A>by the like folly; for being invited to a feast where were the eunuchs 
<A NAME="386"></A>both of the king and of the queen mother, he came arrayed in the dress 
<A NAME="387"></A>and the golden ornaments which he had received from the king. After they 
<A NAME="388"></A>began to drink, the eunuch that was the greatest in power with Parysatis 
<A NAME="389"></A>thus speaks to him: "A magnificent dress, indeed, O Mithridates, is this 
<A NAME="390"></A>which the king has given you; the chains and bracelets are glorious, and 
<A NAME="391"></A>your scymetar of invaluable worth; how happy has he made you, the object 
<A NAME="392"></A>of every eye!" To whom he, being a little overcome with the wine, replied, 
<A NAME="393"></A>"What are these things, Sparamizes? Sure I am, I showed myself to the king 
<A NAME="394"></A>in that day of trial to be one deserving greater and costlier gifts than 
<A NAME="395"></A>these." At which Sparamizes smiling, said, "I do not grudge them to you, 
<A NAME="396"></A>Mithridates; but since the Grecians tell us that wine and truth go together, 
<A NAME="397"></A>let me hear now, my friend, what glorious or mighty matter was it to find 
<A NAME="398"></A>some trappings that had slipped off a horse, and to bring them to the king?" 
<A NAME="399"></A>And this he spoke, not as ignorant of the truth, but desiring to unbosom 
<A NAME="400"></A>him to the company, irritating the vanity of the man, whom drink had now 
<A NAME="401"></A>made eager to talk and incapable of controlling himself. So he forbore 
<A NAME="402"></A>nothing, but said out, "Talk you what you please of horse-trappings and 
<A NAME="403"></A>such trifles; I tell you plainly, that this hand was the death of Cyrus. 
<A NAME="404"></A>For I threw not my darts as Artagerses did, in vain and to no purpose, 
<A NAME="405"></A>but only just missing his eye, and hitting him right on the temple, and 
<A NAME="406"></A>piercing him through. I brought him to the ground; and of that wound he 
<A NAME="407"></A>died." The rest of the company, who saw the end and the hapless fate of 
<A NAME="408"></A>Mithridates as if it were already completed, bowed their heads to the ground; 
<A NAME="409"></A>and he who entertained them said, "Mithridates, my friend, let us eat and 
<A NAME="410"></A>drink now, revering the fortune of our prince, and let us waive discourse 
<A NAME="411"></A>which is too weighty for us."
<A NAME="412"></A><BR><BR>Presently after, Sparamizes told Parysatis what he said, and she 
<A NAME="413"></A>told the king, who was greatly enraged at it, as having the lie given him, 
<A NAME="414"></A>and being in danger to forfeit the most glorious and most pleasant circumstance 
<A NAME="415"></A>of his victory. For it was his desire that every one, whether Greek or 
<A NAME="416"></A>barbarian, should believe that in the mutual assaults and conflicts between 
<A NAME="417"></A>him and his brother, he, giving and receiving a blow, was himself indeed 
<A NAME="418"></A>wounded, but that the other lost his life. And, therefore, he decreed that 
<A NAME="419"></A>Mithridates should be put to death in boats; which execution is after the 
<A NAME="420"></A>following manner: Taking two boats framed exactly to fit and answer each 
<A NAME="421"></A>other, they lay down in one of them the malefactor that suffers, upon his 
<A NAME="422"></A>back; then, covering it with the other, and so setting them together that 
<A NAME="423"></A>the head, hands, and feet of him are left outside, and the rest of his 
<A NAME="424"></A>body lies shut up within, they offer him food, and if he refuse to eat 
<A NAME="425"></A>it, they force him to do it by pricking his eyes; then, after he has eaten, 
<A NAME="426"></A>they drench him with a mixture of milk and honey, pouring it not only into 
<A NAME="427"></A>his mouth, but all over his face. They then keep his face continually turned 
<A NAME="428"></A>towards the sun: and it becomes completely covered up and hidden by the 
<A NAME="429"></A>multitude of flies that settle on it. And as within the boats he does what 
<A NAME="430"></A>those that eat and drink must needs do, creeping things and vermin spring 
<A NAME="431"></A>out of the corruption and rottenness of the excrement, and these entering 
<A NAME="432"></A>into the bowels of him, his body is consumed. When the man is manifestly 
<A NAME="433"></A>dead, the uppermost boat being taken off, they find his flesh devoured, 
<A NAME="434"></A>and swarms of such noisome creatures preying upon and, as it were, growing 
<A NAME="435"></A>to his inwards. In this way Mithridates, after suffering for seventeen 
<A NAME="436"></A>days, at last expired.
<A NAME="437"></A><BR><BR>Masabates, the king's eunuch, who had cut off the hand and head 
<A NAME="438"></A>of Cyrus, remained still as a mark for Parysatis's vengeance. Whereas, 
<A NAME="439"></A>therefore, he was so circumspect, that he gave her no advantage against 
<A NAME="440"></A>him, she framed this kind of snare for him. She was a very ingenious woman 
<A NAME="441"></A>in other ways, and was an excellent player at dice, and, before the war, 
<A NAME="442"></A>had often played with the king. After the war, too, when she had been reconciled 
<A NAME="443"></A>to him, she joined readily in all amusements with him, played at dice with 
<A NAME="444"></A>him, was his confidant in his love matters, and in every way did her best 
<A NAME="445"></A>to leave him as little as possible in the company of Statira, both because 
<A NAME="446"></A>she hated her more than any other person, and because she wished to have 
<A NAME="447"></A>no one so powerful as herself. And so once when Artaxerxes was at leisure, 
<A NAME="448"></A>and inclined to divert himself, she challenged him to play at dice with 
<A NAME="449"></A>her for a thousand darics, and purposely let him win them, and paid him 
<A NAME="450"></A>down in gold. Yet, pretending to be concerned for her loss, and that she 
<A NAME="451"></A>would gladly have her revenge for it, she pressed him to begin a new game 
<A NAME="452"></A>for a eunuch; to which he consented. But first they agreed that each of 
<A NAME="453"></A>them might except five of their most trusty eunuchs, and that out of the 
<A NAME="454"></A>rest of them the loser should yield up any the winner should make choice 
<A NAME="455"></A>of. Upon these conditions they played. Thus being bent upon her design, 
<A NAME="456"></A>and thoroughly in earnest with her game, and the dice also running luckily 
<A NAME="457"></A>for her, when she had got the game, she demanded Masabates, who was not 
<A NAME="458"></A>in the number of the five excepted. And before the king could suspect the 
<A NAME="459"></A>matter, having delivered him up to the tormentors, she enjoined them to 
<A NAME="460"></A>flay him alive, to set his body upon three stakes, and to stretch his skin 
<A NAME="461"></A>upon stakes separately from it.
<A NAME="462"></A><BR><BR>These things being done, and the king taking them ill, and being 
<A NAME="463"></A>incensed against her, she with raillery and laughter told him, "You are 
<A NAME="464"></A>a comfortable and happy man indeed, if you are so much disturbed for the 
<A NAME="465"></A>sake of an old rascally eunuch, when I, though I have thrown away a thousand 
<A NAME="466"></A>darics, hold my peace and acquiesce in my fortune." So the king, vexed 
<A NAME="467"></A>with himself for having been thus deluded, hushed up all. But Statira both 
<A NAME="468"></A>in other matters openly opposed her, and was angry with her for thus, against 
<A NAME="469"></A>all law and humanity, sacrificing to the memory of Cyrus the king's faithful 
<A NAME="470"></A>friend and eunuch.
<A NAME="471"></A><BR><BR>Now after that Tisaphernes had circumvented and by a false oath 
<A NAME="472"></A>had betrayed Clearchus and the other commanders, and, taking them, had 
<A NAME="473"></A>sent them bound in chains to the king, Ctesias says that he was asked by 
<A NAME="474"></A>Clearchus to supply him with a comb; and that when he had it, and had combed 
<A NAME="475"></A>his head with it, he was much pleased with this good office, and gave him 
<A NAME="476"></A>a ring, which might be a token of the obligation to his relatives and friends 
<A NAME="477"></A>in Sparta; and that the engraving upon this signet was a set of Caryatides 
<A NAME="478"></A>dancing. He tells us that the soldiers, his fellow-captives, used to purloin 
<A NAME="479"></A>a part of the allowance of food sent to Clearchus, giving him but little 
<A NAME="480"></A>of it; which thing Ctesias says he rectified, causing a better allowance 
<A NAME="481"></A>to be conveyed to him, and that a separate share should be distributed 
<A NAME="482"></A>to the soldiers by themselves; adding that he ministered to and supplied 
<A NAME="483"></A>him thus by the interest and at the instance of Parysatis. And there being 
<A NAME="484"></A>a portion of ham sent daily with his other food to Clearchus, she, he says, 
<A NAME="485"></A>advised and instructed him, that he ought to bury a small knife in the 
<A NAME="486"></A>meat, and thus send it to his friend, and not leave his fate to be determined 
<A NAME="487"></A>by the king's cruelty; which he, however, he says, was afraid to do. However, 
<A NAME="488"></A>Artaxerxes consented to the entreaties of his mother, and promised her 
<A NAME="489"></A>with an oath that he would spare Clearchus; but afterwards, at the instigation 
<A NAME="490"></A>of Statira, he put every one of them to death except Menon. And thenceforward, 
<A NAME="491"></A>he says, Parysatis watched her advantage against Statira and made up poison 
<A NAME="492"></A>for her; not a very probable story, or a very likely motive to account 
<A NAME="493"></A>for her conduct, if indeed he means that out of respect to Clearchus she 
<A NAME="494"></A>dared to attempt the life of the lawful queen, that was mother of those 
<A NAME="495"></A>who were heirs of the empire. But it is evident enough, that this part 
<A NAME="496"></A>of his history is a sort of funeral exhibition in honour of Clearchus. 
<A NAME="497"></A>For he would have us believe that, when the generals were executed, the 
<A NAME="498"></A>rest of them were torn in pieces by dogs and birds; but as for the remains 
<A NAME="499"></A>of Clearchus, that a violent gust of wind, bearing before it a vast heap 
<A NAME="500"></A>of earth, raised a mound to cover his body, upon which, after a short time, 
<A NAME="501"></A>some dates having fallen there, a beautiful grove of trees grew up and 
<A NAME="502"></A>overshadowed the place, so that the king himself declared his sorrow, concluding 
<A NAME="503"></A>that in Clearchus he put to death a man beloved of the 
<A NAME="504"></A>gods.
<A NAME="505"></A><BR><BR>Parysatis, therefore, having from the first entertained a secret 
<A NAME="506"></A>hatred and jealousy against Statira, seeing that the power she herself 
<A NAME="507"></A>had with Artaxerxes was founded upon feelings of honour and respect for 
<A NAME="508"></A>her, but that Statira's influence was firmly and strongly based upon love 
<A NAME="509"></A>and confidence, was resolved to contrive her ruin, playing at hazard, as 
<A NAME="510"></A>she thought, for the greatest stake in the world. Among her attendant women 
<A NAME="511"></A>there was one that was trusty and in the highest esteem with her, whose 
<A NAME="512"></A>name was Gigis; who, as Dinon avers, assisted in making up the poison. 
<A NAME="513"></A>Ctesias allows her only to have been conscious of it, and that against 
<A NAME="514"></A>her will; charging Belitaras with actually giving the drug, whereas Dinon 
<A NAME="515"></A>says it was Melantas. The two women had begun again to visit each other 
<A NAME="516"></A>and to eat together; but though they had thus far relaxed their former 
<A NAME="517"></A>habits of jealousy and variance, still, out of fear and as a matter of 
<A NAME="518"></A>caution, they always ate of the same dishes and of the same parts of them. 
<A NAME="519"></A>Now there is a small Persian bird, in the inside of which no excrement 
<A NAME="520"></A>is found, only a mass of fat, so that they suppose the little creatures 
<A NAME="521"></A>lives upon air and dew. It is called rhyntaces. Ctesias affirms, that Parysatis, 
<A NAME="522"></A>cutting a bird of this kind into two pieces with a knife one side of which 
<A NAME="523"></A>had been smeared with the drug, the other side being clear of it, ate the 
<A NAME="524"></A>untouched and wholesome part herself, and gave Statira that which was thus 
<A NAME="525"></A>infected; but Dinon will not have it to be Parysatis, but Melantas, that 
<A NAME="526"></A>cut up the bird and presented the envenomed part of it to Statira; who, 
<A NAME="527"></A>dying with dreadful agonies and convulsions, was herself sensible of what 
<A NAME="528"></A>had happened to her, and aroused in the king's mind suspicion of his mother, 
<A NAME="529"></A>whose savage and implacable temper he knew. And therefore proceeding instantly 
<A NAME="530"></A>to an inquest, he seized upon his mother's domestic servants that attended 
<A NAME="531"></A>at her table and put them upon the rack. Parysatis kept Gigis at home with 
<A NAME="532"></A>her a long time, and though the king commanded her, she would not produce 
<A NAME="533"></A>her. But she, at last herself desiring that she might be dismissed to her 
<A NAME="534"></A>own home by night, Artaxerxes had intimation of it, and lying in wait for 
<A NAME="535"></A>her, hurried her away, and adjudged her to death. Now poisoners in Persia 
<A NAME="536"></A>suffer thus by law. There is a broad stone, on which they place the head 
<A NAME="537"></A>of the culprit, and then with another stone beat and press it, until the 
<A NAME="538"></A>face and the head itself are all pounded to pieces; which was the punishment 
<A NAME="539"></A>Gigis lost her life by. But to his mother, Artaxerxes neither said nor 
<A NAME="540"></A>did any other hurt, save that he banished and confined her, not much against 
<A NAME="541"></A>her will, to Babylon, protesting that while she lived he would not come 
<A NAME="542"></A>near that city. Such was the condition of the king's affairs in his own 
<A NAME="543"></A>house.
<A NAME="544"></A><BR><BR>But when all his attempts to capture the Greeks that had come with 
<A NAME="545"></A>Cyrus, though he desired to do so no less than he had desired to overcome 
<A NAME="546"></A>Cyrus and maintain his throne, proved unlucky, and they, though they had 
<A NAME="547"></A>lost both Cyrus and their own generals, nevertheless escaped, as it were, 
<A NAME="548"></A>out of his very palace, making it plain to all men that the Persian king 
<A NAME="549"></A>and his empire were mighty indeed in gold and luxury and women, but otherwise 
<A NAME="550"></A>were a mere show and vain display, upon this all Greece took courage and 
<A NAME="551"></A>despised the barbarians; and especially the Lacedaemonians thought it strange 
<A NAME="552"></A>if they should not now deliver their countrymen that dwelt in Asia from 
<A NAME="553"></A>their subjection to the Persians, nor put an end to the contumelious usage 
<A NAME="554"></A>of them. And first having an army under the conduct of Thimbron, then under 
<A NAME="555"></A>Dercyllidas, but doing nothing memorable, they at last committed the war 
<A NAME="556"></A>to the management of their King Agesilaus, who, when he had arrived with 
<A NAME="557"></A>his men in Asia, as soon as he had landed them, fell actively to work, 
<A NAME="558"></A>and got himself great renown. He defeated Tisaphernes in a pitched battle, 
<A NAME="559"></A>and set many cities in revolt. Upon this, Artaxerxes, perceiving what was 
<A NAME="560"></A>his wisest way of waging the war, sent Timocrates the Rhodian into Greece, 
<A NAME="561"></A>with large sums of gold, commanding him by a free distribution of it to 
<A NAME="562"></A>corrupt the leading men in the cities, and to excite a Greek war against 
<A NAME="563"></A>Sparta. So Timocrates following his instructions, the most considerable 
<A NAME="564"></A>cities conspiring together, and Peloponnesus being in disorder, the ephors 
<A NAME="565"></A>remanded Agesilaus from Asia. At which time, they gay, as he was upon his 
<A NAME="566"></A>return, he told his friends that Artaxerxes had driven him out of Asia 
<A NAME="567"></A>with thirty thousand archers; the Persian coin having an archer stamped 
<A NAME="568"></A>upon it.
<A NAME="569"></A><BR><BR>Artaxerxes scoured the seas, too, of the Lacedaemonians, Conon 
<A NAME="570"></A>the Athenian and Pharnabazus being his admirals. For Conon, after the battle 
<A NAME="571"></A>of Aegospotami, resided in Cyprus; not that he consulted his own mere security, 
<A NAME="572"></A>but looking for a vicissitude of affairs with no less hope than men wait 
<A NAME="573"></A>for a change of wind at sea. And perceiving that his skill wanted power, 
<A NAME="574"></A>and that the king's power wanted a wise man to guide it, he sent him an 
<A NAME="575"></A>account of his projects, and charged the bearer to hand it to the king, 
<A NAME="576"></A>if possible, by the mediation of Zeno the Cretan or Polycritus the Mendaean 
<A NAME="577"></A>(the former being a dancing-master, the latter a physician), or, in the 
<A NAME="578"></A>absence of them both, by Ctesias; who is said to have taken Conon's letter, 
<A NAME="579"></A>and foisted into the contents of it a request, that the king would also 
<A NAME="580"></A>be pleased to send over Ctesias to him, who was likely to be of use on 
<A NAME="581"></A>the sea-coast. Ctesias, however, declares that the king, of his accord, 
<A NAME="582"></A>deputed him to his service. Artaxerxes, however, defeating the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="583"></A>in a sea-fight at Cnidos, under the conduct of Pharnabazus and Conon, after 
<A NAME="584"></A>he had stripped them of their sovereignty by sea, at the same time brought, 
<A NAME="585"></A>so to say, the whole of Greece over to him, so that upon his own terms 
<A NAME="586"></A>he dictated the celebrated peace among them, styled the peace of Antalcidas. 
<A NAME="587"></A>This Antalcidas was a Spartan, the son of one Leon, who, acting for the 
<A NAME="588"></A>king's interest, induced the Lacadaemonians to covenant to let all the 
<A NAME="589"></A>Greek cities in Asia and the islands adjacent to it become subject and 
<A NAME="590"></A>tributary to him, peace being upon these conditions established among the 
<A NAME="591"></A>Greeks, if indeed the honourable name of peace can fairly be given to what 
<A NAME="592"></A>was in fact the disgrace and betrayal of Greece, a treaty more inglorious 
<A NAME="593"></A>than had ever been the result of any war to those defeated in 
<A NAME="594"></A>it.
<A NAME="595"></A><BR><BR>And therefore Artaxerxes, though always abominating other Spartans, 
<A NAME="596"></A>and looking upon them, as Dinon says, to be the most impudent men living, 
<A NAME="597"></A>gave wonderful honour to Antalcidas when he came to him into Persia; so 
<A NAME="598"></A>much so that one day, taking a garland of flowers and dipping it in the 
<A NAME="599"></A>most precious ointment, he sent it to him after supper, a favour which 
<A NAME="600"></A>all were amazed at. Indeed he was a person fit to be thus delicately treated, 
<A NAME="601"></A>and to have such a crown, who had among the Persians thus made fools of 
<A NAME="602"></A>Leonidas and Callicratidas. Agesilaus, it seems, on some one having said, 
<A NAME="603"></A>"O the deplorable fate of Greece, now that the Spartans turn Medes!" replied, 
<A NAME="604"></A>"Nay, rather it is the Medes who become Spartans." But the subtlety of 
<A NAME="605"></A>the repartee did not wipe off the infamy of the action. The Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="606"></A>soon after lost their sovereignty in Greece by their defeat at Leuctra; 
<A NAME="607"></A>but they had already lost their honour by this treaty. So long then as 
<A NAME="608"></A>Sparta continued to be the first state in Greece, Artaxerxes continued 
<A NAME="609"></A>to Antalcidas the honour of being called his friend and his guest; but 
<A NAME="610"></A>when, routed and humbled at the battle of Leuctra, being under great distress 
<A NAME="611"></A>for money, they had despatched Agesilaus into Egypt, and Antalcidas went 
<A NAME="612"></A>up to Artaxerxes, beseeching him to supply their necessities, he so despised, 
<A NAME="613"></A>slighted, and rejected him, that finding himself, on his return, mocked 
<A NAME="614"></A>and insulted by his enemies, and fearing also the ephors, he starved himself 
<A NAME="615"></A>to death. Ismenias, also, the Theban, and Pelopidas, who had already gained 
<A NAME="616"></A>the victory at Leuctra, arrived at the Persian court; where the latter 
<A NAME="617"></A>did nothing unworthy of himself. But Ismenias, being commanded to do obeisance 
<A NAME="618"></A>to the king, dropped his ring before him upon the ground, and so, stooping 
<A NAME="619"></A>to take it up, made a show of doing him homage. He was so gratified with 
<A NAME="620"></A>some secret intelligence which Timagoras the Athenian sent in to him by 
<A NAME="621"></A>the hand of his secretary Beluris, that he bestowed upon him ten thousand 
<A NAME="622"></A>darics, and because he was ordered, on account of some sickness, to drink 
<A NAME="623"></A>cow's milk, there were fourscore milch kine driven after him; also, he 
<A NAME="624"></A>sent him a bed, furniture, and servants for it, the Grecians not having 
<A NAME="625"></A>skill enough to make it, as also chairmen to carry him, being infirm in 
<A NAME="626"></A>body, to the seaside. Not to mention the feast made for him at court, which 
<A NAME="627"></A>was so princely and splendid that Ostanes, the king's brother, said to 
<A NAME="628"></A>him, "O Timagoras, do not forget the sumptuous table you have sat at here; 
<A NAME="629"></A>it was not put before you for nothing;" was indeed rather a reflection 
<A NAME="630"></A>upon his treason than to remind him of the king's bounty. And indeed the 
<A NAME="631"></A>Athenians condemned Timagoras to death for taking bribes.
<A NAME="632"></A><BR><BR>But Artaxerxes gratified the Grecians in one thing in lieu of the 
<A NAME="633"></A>many wherewith he plagued them, and that was by taking off Tisaphernes, 
<A NAME="634"></A>their most hated and malicious enemy, whom he put to death; Parysatis adding 
<A NAME="635"></A>her influence to the charges made against him. For the king did not persist 
<A NAME="636"></A>long in his wrath with his mother, but was reconciled to her, and sent 
<A NAME="637"></A>for her, being assured that she had wisdom and courage fit for royal power, 
<A NAME="638"></A>and there being now no cause discernible but that they might converse together 
<A NAME="639"></A>without suspicion or offence. And from thenceforward humouring the king 
<A NAME="640"></A>in all things according to his heart's desire, and finding fault with nothing 
<A NAME="641"></A>that he did, she obtained great power with him, and was gratified in all 
<A NAME="642"></A>her requests. She perceived he was desperately in love with Atossa, one 
<A NAME="643"></A>of his own two daughters, and that he concealed and checked his passion 
<A NAME="644"></A>chiefly for fear of herself, though, if we may believe some writers, he 
<A NAME="645"></A>had privately given way to it with the young girl already. As soon as Parysatis 
<A NAME="646"></A>suspected it, she displayed a greater fondness for the young girl than 
<A NAME="647"></A>before, and extolled both her virtue and beauty to him, as being truly 
<A NAME="648"></A>imperial and majestic. In fine she persuaded him to marry her and declare 
<A NAME="649"></A>her to be his lawful wife, overriding all the principles and the laws by 
<A NAME="650"></A>which the Greeks hold themselves bound, and regarding himself as divinely 
<A NAME="651"></A>appointed for a law to the Persians, and the supreme arbitrator of good 
<A NAME="652"></A>and evil. Some historians further affirm, in which number is Heraclides 
<A NAME="653"></A>of Cuma, that Artaxerxes married not only this one, but a second daughter 
<A NAME="654"></A>also, Amestris, of whom we shall speak by and by. But he so loved Atossa 
<A NAME="655"></A>when she became his consort, that when leprosy had run through her whole 
<A NAME="656"></A>body, he was not in the least offended at it; but putting up his prayers 
<A NAME="657"></A>to Juno for her, to this one alone of all the deities he made obeisance, 
<A NAME="658"></A>by laying his hands upon the earth; and his satraps and favourites made 
<A NAME="659"></A>such offerings to the goddess by his direction, that all along for sixteen 
<A NAME="660"></A>furlongs, betwixt the court and her temple, the road was filled up with 
<A NAME="661"></A>gold and silver, purple and horses, devoted to her.
<A NAME="662"></A><BR><BR>He waged war out of his own kingdom with the Egyptians, under the 
<A NAME="663"></A>conduct of Pharnabazus and Iphicrates, but was unsuccessful by reason of 
<A NAME="664"></A>their dissensions. In his expedition against the Cadusians, he went himself 
<A NAME="665"></A>in person with three hundred thousand footmen and ten thousand horse, and 
<A NAME="666"></A>making an incursion into their country, which was so mountainous as scarcely 
<A NAME="667"></A>to be passable, and withal very misty, producing no sort of harvest of 
<A NAME="668"></A>corn or the like, but with pears, apples, and other tree-fruits feeding 
<A NAME="669"></A>a war-like and valiant breed of men, he unawares fell into great distresses 
<A NAME="670"></A>and dangers. For there was nothing to be got, fit for his men to eat, of 
<A NAME="671"></A>the growth of that place, nor could anything be imported from any other. 
<A NAME="672"></A>All they could do was to kill their beasts of burden, and thus an ass's 
<A NAME="673"></A>head could scarcely be bought for sixty drachmas. In short, the king's 
<A NAME="674"></A>own table failed; and there were but few horses left; the rest they had 
<A NAME="675"></A>spent for food. Then Teribazus, a man often in great favour with his prince 
<A NAME="676"></A>for his valour and as often out of it for his buffoonery, and particularly 
<A NAME="677"></A>at that time in humble estate and neglected, was the deliverer of the king 
<A NAME="678"></A>and his army. There being two kings amongst the Cadusians, and each of 
<A NAME="679"></A>them encamping separately, Teribazus, after he had made his application 
<A NAME="680"></A>to Artaxerxes and imparted his design to him, went to one of the princes, 
<A NAME="681"></A>and sent away his son privately to the other. So each of them deceived 
<A NAME="682"></A>his man, assuring him that the other prince had deputed an ambassador to 
<A NAME="683"></A>Artaxerxes, suing for friendship and alliance for himself alone; and, therefore, 
<A NAME="684"></A>if he were wise, he told him, he must apply himself to his master before 
<A NAME="685"></A>he had decreed anything, and he, he said, would lend him his assistance 
<A NAME="686"></A>in all things. Both of them gave credit to these words, and because they 
<A NAME="687"></A>supposed they were each intrigued against by the other, they both sent 
<A NAME="688"></A>their envoys, one along with Teribazus, and the other with his son. All 
<A NAME="689"></A>this taking some time to transact, fresh surmises and suspicions of Teribazus 
<A NAME="690"></A>were expressed to the king, who began to be out of heart, sorry that he 
<A NAME="691"></A>had confided in him, and ready to give ear to his rivals who impeached 
<A NAME="692"></A>him. But at last he came, and so did his son, bringing the Cadusian agents 
<A NAME="693"></A>along with them, and so there was a cessation of arms and a peace signed 
<A NAME="694"></A>with both the princes. And Teribazus, in great honour and distinction, 
<A NAME="695"></A>set out homewards in the company of the king; who, indeed, upon this journey 
<A NAME="696"></A>made it appear plainly that cowardice and effeminacy are the effects, not 
<A NAME="697"></A>of delicate and sumptuous living, as many suppose, but of a base and vicious 
<A NAME="698"></A>nature, actuated by false and bad opinions. For notwithstanding his golden 
<A NAME="699"></A>ornaments, his robe of state, and the rest of that costly attire, worth 
<A NAME="700"></A>no less than twelve thousand talents, with which the royal person was constantly 
<A NAME="701"></A>clad, his labours and toils were not a whit inferior to those of the meanest 
<A NAME="702"></A>persons in his army. With his quiver by his side and his shield on his 
<A NAME="703"></A>arm, he led them on foot, quitting his horse, through craggy and steep 
<A NAME="704"></A>ways, insomuch that the sight of his cheerfulness and unwearied strength 
<A NAME="705"></A>gave wings to the soldiers, and so lightened the journey, that they made 
<A NAME="706"></A>daily marches of above two hundred furlongs.
<A NAME="707"></A><BR><BR>After they had arrived at one of his own mansions, which had beautiful 
<A NAME="708"></A>ornamented parks in the midst of a region naked and without trees, the 
<A NAME="709"></A>weather being very cold, he gave full commission to his soldiers to provide 
<A NAME="710"></A>themselves with wood by cutting down any, without exception, even the pine 
<A NAME="711"></A>and cypress. And when they hesitated and were for sparing them, being large 
<A NAME="712"></A>and goodly trees, he, taking up an axe himself, felled the greatest and 
<A NAME="713"></A>most beautiful of them. After which his men used their hatchets, and piling 
<A NAME="714"></A>up many fires, passed away the night at their ease. Nevertheless, he returned 
<A NAME="715"></A>not without the loss of many and valiant subjects, and of almost all his 
<A NAME="716"></A>horses. And supposing that his misfortunes and the ill-success of his expedition 
<A NAME="717"></A>made him despised in the eyes of his people, he looked jealously on his 
<A NAME="718"></A>nobles, many of whom he slew in anger, and yet more out of fear. As, indeed, 
<A NAME="719"></A>fear is the bloodiest passion in princes; confidence, on the other hand, 
<A NAME="720"></A>being merciful, gentle, and unsuspicious. So we see among wild beasts, 
<A NAME="721"></A>the intractable and least tamable are the most timorous and most easily 
<A NAME="722"></A>startled; the nobler creatures, whose courage makes them trustful, are 
<A NAME="723"></A>ready to respond to the advances of men.
<A NAME="724"></A><BR><BR>Artaxerxes, now being an old man, perceived that his sons were 
<A NAME="725"></A>in controversy about his kingdom, and that they made parties among his 
<A NAME="726"></A>favourites and peers. Those that were equitable among them thought it fit, 
<A NAME="727"></A>that as he had received it, so he should bequeath it, by right of age, 
<A NAME="728"></A>to Darius. The younger brother, Ochus, who was hot and violent, had indeed 
<A NAME="729"></A>a considerable number of the courtiers that espoused his interest, but 
<A NAME="730"></A>his chief hope was that by Atossa's means he should win his father. For 
<A NAME="731"></A>he flattered her with the thoughts of being his wife and partner in the 
<A NAME="732"></A>kingdom after the death of Artaxerxes. And truly it was rumoured that already 
<A NAME="733"></A>Ochus maintained a too intimate correspondence with her. This, however, 
<A NAME="734"></A>was quite unknown to the king; who, being willing to put down in good time 
<A NAME="735"></A>his son Ochus's hopes, lest, by his attempting the same things his uncle 
<A NAME="736"></A>Cyrus did, wars and contentions might again afflict his kingdom, proclaimed 
<A NAME="737"></A>Darius, then twenty-five years old, his successor, and gave him leave to 
<A NAME="738"></A>wear the upright hat, as they called it. It was a rule and usage of Persia, 
<A NAME="739"></A>that the heir apparent to the crown should beg a boon, and that he that 
<A NAME="740"></A>declared him so should give whatever he asked, provided it were within 
<A NAME="741"></A>the sphere of his power. Darius therefore requested Aspasia, in former 
<A NAME="742"></A>time the most prized of the concubines of Cyrus, and now belonging to the 
<A NAME="743"></A>king. She was by birth a Phocaean, of Ionia, born of free parents, and 
<A NAME="744"></A>well educated. Once when Cyrus was at supper, she was led in to him with 
<A NAME="745"></A>other women, who, when they were sat down by him, and he began to sport 
<A NAME="746"></A>and dally and talk jestingly with them, gave way freely to his advances. 
<A NAME="747"></A>But she stood by in silence, refusing to come when Cyrus called her, and 
<A NAME="748"></A>when his chamberlains were going to force her towards him, said, "Whosoever 
<A NAME="749"></A>lays hands on me shall rue. it;" so that she seemed to the company a sullen 
<A NAME="750"></A>and rude-mannered person. However, Cyrus was well pleased, and laughed, 
<A NAME="751"></A>saying to the man that brought the women, "Do you not see to a certainty 
<A NAME="752"></A>that this woman alone of all that came with you is truly noble and pure 
<A NAME="753"></A>in character?" After which time he began to regard her, and loved her, 
<A NAME="754"></A>above all of her sex, and called her the Wise. But Cyrus being slain in 
<A NAME="755"></A>the fight, she was taken among the spoils of his camp.
<A NAME="756"></A><BR><BR>Darius, in demanding her, no doubt much offended his father, for 
<A NAME="757"></A>the barbarian people keep a very jealous and watchful eye over their carnal 
<A NAME="758"></A>pleasures, so that it is death for a man not only to come near and touch 
<A NAME="759"></A>any concubine of his prince, but likewise on a journey to ride forward 
<A NAME="760"></A>and pass by the carriages in which they are conveyed. And though, to gratify 
<A NAME="761"></A>his passion, he had against all law married his daughter Atossa, and had 
<A NAME="762"></A>besides her no less than three hundred and sixty concubines selected for 
<A NAME="763"></A>their beauty, yet being importuned for that one by Darius, he urged that 
<A NAME="764"></A>she was a free-woman, and allowed him to take her, if she had an inclination 
<A NAME="765"></A>to go with him, but by no means to force her away against it. Aspasia, 
<A NAME="766"></A>therefore, being sent for, and, contrary to the king's expectation, making 
<A NAME="767"></A>choice of Darius, he gave him her indeed, being constrained by law, but 
<A NAME="768"></A>when he had done so, a little after he took her from him. For he consecrated 
<A NAME="769"></A>her priestess to Diana of Ecbatana, whom they name Anaitis, that she might 
<A NAME="770"></A>spend the remainder of her days in strict chastity, thinking thus to punish 
<A NAME="771"></A>his son, not rigorously, but with moderation, by a revenge checkered with 
<A NAME="772"></A>jest and earnest. But he took it heinously, either that he was passionately 
<A NAME="773"></A>fond of Aspasia, or because he looked upon himself as affronted and scorned 
<A NAME="774"></A>by his father. Teribazus, perceiving him thus minded, did his best to exasperate 
<A NAME="775"></A>him yet further, seeing in his injuries a representation of his own, of 
<A NAME="776"></A>which the following is the account: Artaxerxes, having many daughters, 
<A NAME="777"></A>promised to give Apama to Pharnabazus to wife, Rhodogune to Orontes, and 
<A NAME="778"></A>Amestris to Teribazus; whom alone of the three he disappointed, by marrying 
<A NAME="779"></A>Amestris himself. However, to make him amends, he betrothed his youngest 
<A NAME="780"></A>daughter Atossa to him. But after he had, being enamoured of her too, as 
<A NAME="781"></A>has been said, married her, Teribazus entertained an irreconcilable enmity 
<A NAME="782"></A>against him. As indeed he was seldom at any other time steady in his temper, 
<A NAME="783"></A>but uneven and inconsiderate; so that whether he were in the number of 
<A NAME="784"></A>the choicest favourites of his prince, or whether he were offensive and 
<A NAME="785"></A>odious to him, he demeaned himself in neither condition with moderation, 
<A NAME="786"></A>but if he was advanced he was intolerably insolent, and in his degradation 
<A NAME="787"></A>not submissive and peaceable in his deportment, but fierce and 
<A NAME="788"></A>haughty.
<A NAME="789"></A><BR><BR>And therefore Teribazus was to the young prince flame added upon 
<A NAME="790"></A>flame, ever urging him, and saying, that in vain those wear their hats 
<A NAME="791"></A>upright who consult not the real success of their affairs, and that he 
<A NAME="792"></A>was ill-befriended of reason if he imagined, whilst he had a brother, who, 
<A NAME="793"></A>through the women's apartments, was seeking a way to the supremacy, and 
<A NAME="794"></A>a father of so rash and fickle a humour, that he should by succession infallibly 
<A NAME="795"></A>step up into the throne. For he that out of fondness to an Ionian girl 
<A NAME="796"></A>has eluded a law sacred and inviolable among the Persians is not likely 
<A NAME="797"></A>to be faithful in the performance of the most important promises. He added, 
<A NAME="798"></A>too, that it was not all one for Ochus not to attain to, and for him to 
<A NAME="799"></A>be put by his crown; since Ochus as a subject might live happily, and nobody 
<A NAME="800"></A>could hinder him; but he, being proclaimed king, must either take up his 
<A NAME="801"></A>sceptre or lay down his life. These words presently inflamed Darius: what 
<A NAME="802"></A>Sophocles says being indeed generally true:-
<A NAME="803"></A><BR><BR>"Quick travels the persuasion to what's wrong." For the path is 
<A NAME="804"></A>smooth, and upon an easy descent, that leads us to our own will; and the 
<A NAME="805"></A>most part of us desire what is evil through our strangeness to and ignorance 
<A NAME="806"></A>of good. And in this case, no doubt, the greatness of the empire and the 
<A NAME="807"></A>jealousy Darius had of Ochus furnished Teribazus with material for his 
<A NAME="808"></A>persuasions. Nor was Venus wholly unconcerned in the matter, in regard, 
<A NAME="809"></A>namely, of his loss of Aspasia.
<A NAME="810"></A><BR><BR>Darius, therefore, resigned himself up to the dictates of Teribazus; 
<A NAME="811"></A>and many now conspiring with them, a eunuch gave information to the king 
<A NAME="812"></A>of their plot and the way how it was to be managed, having discovered the 
<A NAME="813"></A>certainty of it, that they had resolved to break into his bed-chamber by 
<A NAME="814"></A>night, and there to kill him as he lay. After Artaxerxes had been thus 
<A NAME="815"></A>advertised, he did not think fit, by disregarding the discovery, to despise 
<A NAME="816"></A>so great a danger, nor to believe it when there was little or no proof 
<A NAME="817"></A>of it. Thus then he did: he charged the eunuch constantly to attend and 
<A NAME="818"></A>accompany the conspirators wherever they were; in the meanwhile, he broke 
<A NAME="819"></A>down the party-wall of the chamber behind his bed, and placed a door in 
<A NAME="820"></A>it to open and shut, which he covered up with tapestry; so the hour approaching, 
<A NAME="821"></A>and the eunuch having told him the precise time in which the traitors designed 
<A NAME="822"></A>to assassinate him, he waited for them in his bed, and rose not up till 
<A NAME="823"></A>he had seen the faces of his assailants and recognized every man of them. 
<A NAME="824"></A>But as soon as he saw them with their swords drawn and coming up to him, 
<A NAME="825"></A>throwing up the hanging, he made his retreat into the inner chamber, and, 
<A NAME="826"></A>bolting the door, raised a cry. Thus when the murderers had been seen by 
<A NAME="827"></A>him, and had attempted him in vain, they with speed went back through the 
<A NAME="828"></A>same doors they came in by, enjoining Teribazus and his friends to fly, 
<A NAME="829"></A>as their plot had been certainly detected. They, therefore, made their 
<A NAME="830"></A>escape different ways; but Teribazus was seized by the king's guards, and 
<A NAME="831"></A>after slaying many, while they were laying hold on him, at length being 
<A NAME="832"></A>struck through with a dart at a distance, fell. As for Darius, who was 
<A NAME="833"></A>brought to trial with his children, the king appointed the royal judges 
<A NAME="834"></A>to sit over him, and because he was not himself present, but accused Darius 
<A NAME="835"></A>by proxy, he commanded his scribes to write down the opinion of every one 
<A NAME="836"></A>of the judges, and show it to him. And after they had given their sentences, 
<A NAME="837"></A>all as one man, and condemned Darius to death, the officers seized on him, 
<A NAME="838"></A>and hurried him to a chamber not far off. To which place the executioner, 
<A NAME="839"></A>when summoned, came with a razor in his hand, with which men of his employment 
<A NAME="840"></A>cut off the heads of offenders. But when he saw that Darius was the person 
<A NAME="841"></A>thus to be punished he was appalled and started back, offering to go out, 
<A NAME="842"></A>as one that had neither power nor courage enough to behead a king; yet 
<A NAME="843"></A>at the threats and commands of the judges who stood at the prison door, 
<A NAME="844"></A>he returned and grasping the hair of his head and bringing his face to 
<A NAME="845"></A>the ground with one hand, he cut through his neck with the razor he had 
<A NAME="846"></A>in the other. Some affirm that sentence was passed in the presence of Artaxerxes; 
<A NAME="847"></A>that Darius, after he had been convicted by clear evidence, falling prostrate 
<A NAME="848"></A>before him, did humbly beg his pardon; that instead of giving it, he rising 
<A NAME="849"></A>up in rage and drawing his scymetar, smote him till he had killed him; 
<A NAME="850"></A>and then, going forth into the court, he worshipped the sun, and said, 
<A NAME="851"></A>"Depart in peace, ye Persians, and declare to your fellow-subjects how 
<A NAME="852"></A>the mighty Oromasdes hath dealt out vengeance to the contrivers of unjust 
<A NAME="853"></A>and unlawful things."
<A NAME="854"></A><BR><BR>Such, then, was the issue of this conspiracy. And now Ochus was 
<A NAME="855"></A>high in his hopes, being confident in the influence of Atossa; but yet 
<A NAME="856"></A>was afraid of Ariaspes, the only male surviving, besides himself, of the 
<A NAME="857"></A>legitimate offspring of his father, and of Arsames, one of his natural 
<A NAME="858"></A>sons. For indeed Ariaspes was already claimed as their prince by the wishes 
<A NAME="859"></A>of the Persians, not because he was the elder brother, but because he excelled 
<A NAME="860"></A>Ochus in gentleness, plain dealing, and good-nature; and on the other hand 
<A NAME="861"></A>Arsames appeared, by his wisdom, fitted for the throne, and that he was 
<A NAME="862"></A>dear to his father Ochus well knew. So he laid snares for them both, and 
<A NAME="863"></A>being no less treacherous than bloody, he made use of the cruelty of his 
<A NAME="864"></A>nature against Arsames, and of his craft and wiliness against Ariaspes. 
<A NAME="865"></A>For he suborned the king's eunuchs and favourites to convey to him menacing 
<A NAME="866"></A>and harsh expressions from his father, as though he had decreed to put 
<A NAME="867"></A>him to a cruel and ignominious death. When they daily communicated these 
<A NAME="868"></A>things as secrets, and told him at one time that the king would do so to 
<A NAME="869"></A>him ere long, and at another, that the blow was actually close impending, 
<A NAME="870"></A>they so alarmed the young man, struck such a terror into him, and cast 
<A NAME="871"></A>such a confusion and anxiety upon his thoughts, that, having prepared some 
<A NAME="872"></A>poisonous drugs, he drank them, that he might be delivered from his life. 
<A NAME="873"></A>The king, on hearing what kind of death he died, heartily lamented him, 
<A NAME="874"></A>and was not without a suspicion of the cause of it. But being disabled 
<A NAME="875"></A>by his age to search into and prove it, he was, after the loss of this 
<A NAME="876"></A>son, more affectionate than before to Arsames, did manifestly place his 
<A NAME="877"></A>greatest confidence in him, and made him privy to his counsels. Whereupon 
<A NAME="878"></A>Ochus had no longer patience to defer the execution of his purpose, but 
<A NAME="879"></A>having procured Arpates, Teribazus's son, for the undertaking, he killed 
<A NAME="880"></A>Arsames by his hand. Artaxerxes at that time had but a little hold on life, 
<A NAME="881"></A>by reason of his extreme age, and so, when he heard of the fate of Arsames, 
<A NAME="882"></A>he could not sustain it at all, but sinking at once under the weight of 
<A NAME="883"></A>his grief and distress, expired, after a life of ninety-four years, and 
<A NAME="884"></A>a reign of sixty-two. And then he seemed a moderate and gracious governor, 
<A NAME="885"></A>more especially as compared to his son Ochus, who outdid all his predecessors 
<A NAME="886"></A>in blood-thirstiness and cruelty.
