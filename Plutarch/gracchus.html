<BR>(legendary, died 121 B.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>CAIUS Gracchus at first, either for fear of his brother's enemies, or designing 
<A NAME="11"></A>to render them more odious to the people, absented himself from the public 
<A NAME="12"></A>assemblies, and lived quietly in his own house, as if he were not only 
<A NAME="13"></A>reduced for the present to live unambitiously, but was disposed in general 
<A NAME="14"></A>to pass his life in inaction. And some indeed, went so far as to say that 
<A NAME="15"></A>he disliked his brother's measures, and had wholly abandoned the defence 
<A NAME="16"></A>of them. However, he was not but very young, being not so old as Tiberius 
<A NAME="17"></A>by nine years; and he was not yet thirty when he was 
<A NAME="18"></A>slain.
<A NAME="19"></A><BR><BR>In some little time, however, he quietly let his temper appear, 
<A NAME="20"></A>which was one of an utter antipathy to a lazy retirement and effeminacy, 
<A NAME="21"></A>and not the least likely to be contented with a life of eating, drinking, 
<A NAME="22"></A>and money-getting. He gave great pains to the study of eloquence, as wings 
<A NAME="23"></A>upon which he might aspire to public business; and it was very apparent 
<A NAME="24"></A>that he did not intend to pass his days in obscurity. When Vettius, a friend 
<A NAME="25"></A>of his, was on his trial, he defended his cause, and the people were in 
<A NAME="26"></A>an ecstasy, and transported with joy, finding him master of such eloquence 
<A NAME="27"></A>that the other orators seemed like children in comparison, and jealousies 
<A NAME="28"></A>and fears on the other hand began to be felt by the powerful citizens; 
<A NAME="29"></A>and it was generally spoken of amongst them that they must hinder Caius 
<A NAME="30"></A>from being made tribune.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR>But soon after, it happened that he was elected quaestor, and obliged 
<A NAME="32"></A>to attend Orestes, the consul, into Sardinia. This, as it pleased his enemies, 
<A NAME="33"></A>so it was not ungrateful to him, being naturally of a warlike character, 
<A NAME="34"></A>and as well trained in the art of war as in that of pleading. And, besides, 
<A NAME="35"></A>as yet he very much dreaded meddling with state affairs, and appearing 
<A NAME="36"></A>publicly in the rostra, which, because of the importunity of the people 
<A NAME="37"></A>and his friends, he could not otherwise avoid than by taking this journey. 
<A NAME="38"></A>He was therefore most thankful for the opportunity of absenting himself. 
<A NAME="39"></A>Notwithstanding which, it is the prevailing opinion that Caius was a far 
<A NAME="40"></A>more thorough demagogue, and more ambitious than ever Tiberius had been, 
<A NAME="41"></A>of popular applause; yet it is certain that he was borne rather by a sort 
<A NAME="42"></A>of necessity than by any purpose of his own into public business. And Cicero, 
<A NAME="43"></A>the orator, relates, that when he declined all such concerns, and would 
<A NAME="44"></A>have lived privately, his brother appeared to him in a dream, and calling 
<A NAME="45"></A>him by his name, said, "Why do you tarry, Caius? There is no escape; one 
<A NAME="46"></A>life and one death is appointed for us both, to spend the one and to meet 
<A NAME="47"></A>the other in the service of the people."
<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>Caius was no sooner arrived in Sardinia, but he gave exemplary 
<A NAME="49"></A>proofs of his hight merit; he not only excelled all the young men of his 
<A NAME="50"></A>age in his actions against his enemies, in doing justice to his inferiors, 
<A NAME="51"></A>and in showing all obedience and respect to his superior officer; but likewise 
<A NAME="52"></A>in temperance, frugality, and industry, he surpassed even those who were 
<A NAME="53"></A>much older than himself. It happened to be a sharp and sickly winter in 
<A NAME="54"></A>Sardinia, insomuch that the general was forced to lay an imposition upon 
<A NAME="55"></A>several towns to supply the soldiers with necessary clothes. The cities 
<A NAME="56"></A>sent to Rome, petitioning to be excused from that burden; the senate found 
<A NAME="57"></A>their request reasonable, and ordered the general to find some other way 
<A NAME="58"></A>of new clothing the army. While he was at a loss what course to take in 
<A NAME="59"></A>this affair, the soldiers were reduced to great distress; but Caius went 
<A NAME="60"></A>from one city to another, and by his mere representations he prevailed 
<A NAME="61"></A>with them, that of their own accord they clothed the Roman army. This again 
<A NAME="62"></A>being reported to Rome, and seeming to be only an intimation of what was 
<A NAME="63"></A>to be expected of him as a popular leader hereafter, raised new jealousies 
<A NAME="64"></A>amongst the senators. And, besides, there came ambassadors out of Africa 
<A NAME="65"></A>from King Micipsa to acquaint the senate that their master, out of respect 
<A NAME="66"></A>to Caius Gracchus, had sent a considerable quantity of corn to the general 
<A NAME="67"></A>in Sardinia; at which the senators were so much offended that they turned 
<A NAME="68"></A>the ambassadors out of the senate-house and made an order that the soldiers 
<A NAME="69"></A>should be relieved by sending others in their room; but that Orestes should 
<A NAME="70"></A>continue at his post, with whom Caius, also, as they presumed, being his 
<A NAME="71"></A>quaestor, would remain. But he, finding how things were carried, immediately 
<A NAME="72"></A>in anger took ship for Rome, where his unexpected appearance obtained him 
<A NAME="73"></A>the censure not only of his enemies, but also of the people; who thought 
<A NAME="74"></A>it strange that a quaestor should leave before his commander. Nevertheless, 
<A NAME="75"></A>when some accusation upon this ground was made against him to the censors, 
<A NAME="76"></A>he desired leave to defend himself, and did it so effectually, that, when 
<A NAME="77"></A>he ended, he was regarded as one who had been very much injured. He made 
<A NAME="78"></A>it then appear that he had served twelve years in the army whereas others 
<A NAME="79"></A>are obliged to serve only ten; that he had continued quaestor to the general 
<A NAME="80"></A>three years, whereas he might by law have returned at the end of one year; 
<A NAME="81"></A>and alone of all who went on the expedition, he had carried out a full 
<A NAME="82"></A>and had brought home an empty purse, while others, after drinking up the 
<A NAME="83"></A>wine they had carried out with them, brought back the wine-jars filled 
<A NAME="84"></A>again with gold and silver from the war.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>After this they brought other accusations and writs against him, 
<A NAME="86"></A>for exciting insurrection amongst the allies, and being engaged in the 
<A NAME="87"></A>conspiracy that was discovered about Fregellae. But having cleared himself 
<A NAME="88"></A>of every suspicion, and proved his entire innocence, he now at once came 
<A NAME="89"></A>forward to ask for the tribuneship; in which, though he was universally 
<A NAME="90"></A>opposed by all persons of distinction, yet there came such infinite numbers 
<A NAME="91"></A>of people from all parts of Italy to vote for Caius, that lodgings for 
<A NAME="92"></A>them could not be supplied in the city; and the Field being not large enough 
<A NAME="93"></A>to contain the assembly, there were numbers who climbed upon the roofs 
<A NAME="94"></A>and the tilings of the houses to use their voices in his favour. However, 
<A NAME="95"></A>the nobility so far forced the people to their pleasure and disappointed 
<A NAME="96"></A>Caius's hope, that he was not returned the first, as was expected, but 
<A NAME="97"></A>the fourth tribune. But when he came to the execution of his office, it 
<A NAME="98"></A>was seen presently who was really first tribune, as he was a better orator 
<A NAME="99"></A>than any of his contemporaries, and the passion with which he still lamented 
<A NAME="100"></A>his brother's death made him the bolder in speaking. He used on all occasions 
<A NAME="101"></A>to remind the people of what had happened in that tumult, and laid before 
<A NAME="102"></A>them the examples of their ancestors, how they declared war against the 
<A NAME="103"></A>Faliscans, only for giving scurrilous language to one Genucius, a tribune 
<A NAME="104"></A>of the people; and sentenced Caius Veturius to death, for refusing to give 
<A NAME="105"></A>way in the forum to a tribune; "Whereas," said he, "these men did, in the 
<A NAME="106"></A>presence of you all, murder Tiberius with clubs, and dragged the slaughtered 
<A NAME="107"></A>body through the middle of the city, to be cast into the river. Even his 
<A NAME="108"></A>friends, as many as could be taken, were put to death immediately, without 
<A NAME="109"></A>any trial, notwithstanding that just and ancient custom, which has always 
<A NAME="110"></A>been observed in our city, that whenever any one is accused of a capital 
<A NAME="111"></A>crime, and does not make his personal appearance in court, a trumpeter 
<A NAME="112"></A>is sent in the morning to his lodging, to summon him by sound of trumpet 
<A NAME="113"></A>to appear; and before this ceremony is performed, the judges do not proceed 
<A NAME="114"></A>to the vote; so cautious and reserved were our ancestors about business 
<A NAME="115"></A>of life and death."
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR>Having moved the people's passion with such addresses (and his 
<A NAME="117"></A>voice was of the loudest and strongest), he proposed two laws. The first 
<A NAME="118"></A>was, that whoever was turned out of any public office by the people, should 
<A NAME="119"></A>be thereby rendered incapable of bearing any office afterwards; the second, 
<A NAME="120"></A>that if any magistrate condemn a Roman to be banished without a legal trial, 
<A NAME="121"></A>the people be authorized to take cognizance thereof.
<A NAME="122"></A><BR><BR>One of these laws was manifestly levelled at Marcus Octavius, who, 
<A NAME="123"></A>at the instigation of Tiberius, had been deprived of his tribuneship. The 
<A NAME="124"></A>other touched Popilius, who, in his praetorship, had banished all Tiberius's 
<A NAME="125"></A>friends; whereupon Popilius, being unwilling to stand the hazard of a trial, 
<A NAME="126"></A>fled out of Italy. As for the former law, it was withdrawn by Caius himself, 
<A NAME="127"></A>who said he yielded in the case of Octavius, at the request of his mother 
<A NAME="128"></A>Cornelia. This was very acceptable and pleasing to the people, who had 
<A NAME="129"></A>a great veneration for Cornelia, not more for the sake of her father than 
<A NAME="130"></A>for that of her children; and they afterwards erected a statue of brass 
<A NAME="131"></A>in honour of her, with this inscription, Cornelia, the mother of the Gracchi. 
<A NAME="132"></A>There are several expressions recorded, in which he used her name perhaps 
<A NAME="133"></A>with too much rhetoric, and too little self-respect, in his attacks upon 
<A NAME="134"></A>his adversaries. "How," said he, "dare you presume to reflect upon Cornelia, 
<A NAME="135"></A>the mother of Tiberius?" And because the person who made the reflections 
<A NAME="136"></A>had been suspected of effeminate courses, "With what face," said he, "can 
<A NAME="137"></A>you compare Cornelia with yourself? Have you brought forth children as 
<A NAME="138"></A>she has done? And yet all Rome knows that she has refrained from the conversation 
<A NAME="139"></A>of men longer than you yourself have done." Such was the bitterness he 
<A NAME="140"></A>used in his language; and numerous similar expressions might be adduced 
<A NAME="141"></A>from his written remains.
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR>Of the laws which he now proposed, with the object of gratifying 
<A NAME="143"></A>the people and abridging the power of the senate, the first was concerning 
<A NAME="144"></A>the public lands, which were to be divided amongst the poor citizens; another 
<A NAME="145"></A>was concerning the common soldiers, that they should be clothed at the 
<A NAME="146"></A>public charge, without any diminution of their pay, and that none should 
<A NAME="147"></A>be obliged to serve in the army who was not full seventeen years old; another 
<A NAME="148"></A>gave the same right to all the Italians in general, of voting at elections, 
<A NAME="149"></A>as was enjoyed by the citizens of Rome; a fourth related to the price of 
<A NAME="150"></A>corn, which was to be sold at a lower rate than formerly to the poor; and 
<A NAME="151"></A>a fifth regulated the courts of justice, greatly reducing the power of 
<A NAME="152"></A>the senators. For hitherto, in all causes, senators only sat as judges, 
<A NAME="153"></A>and were therefore much dreaded by the Roman knights and the people. But 
<A NAME="154"></A>Caius joined three hundred ordinary citizens of equestrian rank with the 
<A NAME="155"></A>senators, who were three hundred likewise in number, and ordained that 
<A NAME="156"></A>the judicial authority should be equally invested in the six hundred. While 
<A NAME="157"></A>he was arguing for the ratification of this law, his behaviour was observed 
<A NAME="158"></A>to show in many respects unusual earnestness, and whereas other popular 
<A NAME="159"></A>leaders had always hitherto, when speaking, turned their faces towards 
<A NAME="160"></A>the senate-house, and the place called the comitium, he, on the contrary, 
<A NAME="161"></A>was the first man that in his harangue to the people turned himself the 
<A NAME="162"></A>other way, towards them, and continued after that time to do so. An insignificant 
<A NAME="163"></A>movement and change of posture, yet it marked no small revolution in state 
<A NAME="164"></A>affairs, the conversion, in a manner, of the whole government from an aristocracy 
<A NAME="165"></A>to a democracy, his action intimating that public speakers should address 
<A NAME="166"></A>themselves to the people, not the senate.
<A NAME="167"></A><BR><BR>When the commonalty ratified this law, and gave him power to select 
<A NAME="168"></A>those of the knights whom he approved of, to be judges, he was invested 
<A NAME="169"></A>with a sort of a kingly power, and the senate itself submitted to receive 
<A NAME="170"></A>his advice in matters of difficulty; nor did he advise anything that might 
<A NAME="171"></A>derogate from the honour of that body. As, for example, his resolution 
<A NAME="172"></A>about the corn which Fabius the propraetor sent from Spain, was very just 
<A NAME="173"></A>and honourable; for he persuaded the senate to sell the corn, and return 
<A NAME="174"></A>the money to the same provinces which had furnished them with it; and also 
<A NAME="175"></A>that Fabius should be censured for rendering the Roman government odious 
<A NAME="176"></A>and insupportable. This got him extraordinary respect and favour among 
<A NAME="177"></A>the provinces. Besides all this, he proposed measures for the colonization 
<A NAME="178"></A>of several cities, for making roads, and for building public granaries; 
<A NAME="179"></A>of all which works he himself undertook the management and superintendence, 
<A NAME="180"></A>and was never wanting to give necessary orders for the despatch of all 
<A NAME="181"></A>these different and great undertakings; and that with such wonderful expedition 
<A NAME="182"></A>and diligence, as if he had been but engaged upon one of them; insomuch 
<A NAME="183"></A>that all persons, even those who hated or feared him, stood amazed to see 
<A NAME="184"></A>what a capacity he had for effecting and completing all he undertook. As 
<A NAME="185"></A>for the people themselves, they were transported at the very sight, when 
<A NAME="186"></A>they saw him surrounded with a crowd of contractors, artificers, public 
<A NAME="187"></A>deputies, military officers, soldiers, and scholars. All these he treated 
<A NAME="188"></A>with an easy familiarity, yet without abandoning his dignity in his gentleness; 
<A NAME="189"></A>and so accommodated his nature to the wants and occasions of every one 
<A NAME="190"></A>who addressed him, that those were looked upon as no better than envious 
<A NAME="191"></A>detractors, who had represented him as a terrible, assuming, and violent 
<A NAME="192"></A>character. He was even a greater master of the popular leader's art in 
<A NAME="193"></A>his common talk and his actions, than he was in his public 
<A NAME="194"></A>addresses.
<A NAME="195"></A><BR><BR>His most especial exertions were given to constructing the roads, 
<A NAME="196"></A>which he was careful to make beautiful and pleasant, as well as convenient. 
<A NAME="197"></A>They were drawn by his directions through the fields, exactly in a straight 
<A NAME="198"></A>line, partly paved with hewn stone, and partly laid with solid masses of 
<A NAME="199"></A>gravel. When he met with any valleys or deep watercourses crossing the 
<A NAME="200"></A>line, he either caused them to be filled up with rubbish, or bridges to 
<A NAME="201"></A>be built over them, so well levelled, that all being of an equal height 
<A NAME="202"></A>on both sides, the work presented one uniform and beautiful prospect. Besides 
<A NAME="203"></A>this, he caused the roads to be all divided into miles (each mile containing 
<A NAME="204"></A>little less than eight furlongs), and erected pillars of stone to signify 
<A NAME="205"></A>the distance from one place to another. He likewise placed other stones 
<A NAME="206"></A>at small distances from one another, on both sides of the way, by the help 
<A NAME="207"></A>of which travellers might get easily on horseback without wanting a 
<A NAME="208"></A>groom.
<A NAME="209"></A><BR><BR>For these reasons, the people highly extolled him, and were ready 
<A NAME="210"></A>upon all occasions to express their affection towards him. One day, in 
<A NAME="211"></A>an oration to them, he declared that he had only one favour to request, 
<A NAME="212"></A>which if they granted, he should think the greatest obligation in the world; 
<A NAME="213"></A>yet if it were denied, he would never blame them for the refusal. This 
<A NAME="214"></A>expression made the world believe that his ambition was to be consul; and 
<A NAME="215"></A>it was generally expected that he wished to be both consul and tribune 
<A NAME="216"></A>at the same time. When the day for election of consuls was at hand, and 
<A NAME="217"></A>all in great expectation, he appeared in the Field with Caius Fannius, 
<A NAME="218"></A>canvassing together with his friends for his election. This was of great 
<A NAME="219"></A>effect in Fannius's favour. He was chosen consul, and Caius elected tribune 
<A NAME="220"></A>the second time, without his own seeking or petitioning for it, but at 
<A NAME="221"></A>the voluntary motion of the people. But when he understood that the senators 
<A NAME="222"></A>were his declared enemies, and that Fannius himself was none of the most 
<A NAME="223"></A>zealous of friends, he began again to rouse the people with other new laws. 
<A NAME="224"></A>He proposed that a colony of Roman citizens might be sent to re-people 
<A NAME="225"></A>Tarentum and Capua, and that the Latins should enjoy the same privileges 
<A NAME="226"></A>with the citizens fo Rome. But the senate, apprehending that he would at 
<A NAME="227"></A>last grow too powerful and dangerous, took a new and unusual course to 
<A NAME="228"></A>alienate the people's affections from him, by playing the demagogue in 
<A NAME="229"></A>opposition to him, and offering favours contrary to all good policy. Livius 
<A NAME="230"></A>Drusus was fellow-tribune with Caius, a person of as good a family and 
<A NAME="231"></A>as well educated as any amongst the Romans, and noways inferior to those 
<A NAME="232"></A>who for their eloquence and riches were the most honoured and most powerful 
<A NAME="233"></A>men of that time. To him, therefore, the chief senators made their application, 
<A NAME="234"></A>exhorting him to attack Caius, and join in their confederacy against him; 
<A NAME="235"></A>which they designed to carry on, not by using any force, or opposing the 
<A NAME="236"></A>common people, but by gratifying and obliging them with such unreasonable 
<A NAME="237"></A>things as otherwise they would have felt it honourable for them to incur 
<A NAME="238"></A>the greatest unpopularity in resisting.
<A NAME="239"></A><BR><BR>Livius offered to serve the senate with his authority in this business; 
<A NAME="240"></A>and proceeded accordingly to bring forward such laws as were in reality 
<A NAME="241"></A>neither honourable nor advantageous for the public; his whole design being 
<A NAME="242"></A>to outdo Caius in pleasing and cajoling the populace (as if it had been 
<A NAME="243"></A>in some comedy), with obsequious flattery and every kind of gratifications; 
<A NAME="244"></A>the senate thus letting it be seen plainly that they were not angry with 
<A NAME="245"></A>Caius's public measures, but only desirous to ruin him utterly, or at least 
<A NAME="246"></A>to lessen his reputation. For when Caius proposed the settlement of only 
<A NAME="247"></A>two colonies, and mentioned the better class of citizens for that purpose, 
<A NAME="248"></A>they accused him of abusing the people; and yet, on the contrary, were 
<A NAME="249"></A>pleased with Drusus, when he proposed the sending out of twelve colonies, 
<A NAME="250"></A>each to consist of three thousand persons, and those, too, the most needy 
<A NAME="251"></A>that he could find. When Caius divided the public land amongst the poor 
<A NAME="252"></A>citizens, and charged them with a small rent, annually to be paid into 
<A NAME="253"></A>the exchequer, they were angry at him, as one who sought to gratify the 
<A NAME="254"></A>people only for his own interest; yet afterwards they commended Livius, 
<A NAME="255"></A>though he exempted them from paying even that little acknowledgment. They 
<A NAME="256"></A>were displeased with Caius for offering the Latins an equal right with 
<A NAME="257"></A>the Romans of voting at the election of magistrates; but when Livius proposed 
<A NAME="258"></A>that it might not be lawful for a Roman captain to scourge a Latin soldier, 
<A NAME="259"></A>they promoted the passing of that law. And Livius, in all his speeches 
<A NAME="260"></A>to the people, always told them that he proposed no laws but such as were 
<A NAME="261"></A>agreeable to the senate, who had a particular regard to the people's advantage. 
<A NAME="262"></A>And this truly was the only point in all his proceedings which was of any 
<A NAME="263"></A>real service, as it created more kindly feelings towards the senate in 
<A NAME="264"></A>the people; and whereas they formerly suspected and hated the principal 
<A NAME="265"></A>senators, Livius appeased and mitigated this perverseness and animosity, 
<A NAME="266"></A>by his profession that he had done nothing in favour and for the benefit 
<A NAME="267"></A>of the commons without their advice and approbation.
<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR>But the greatest credit which Drusus got for kindness and justice 
<A NAME="269"></A>towards the people was, that he never seemed to propose any law for his 
<A NAME="270"></A>own sake, or his own advantage; he committed the charge of seeing the colonies 
<A NAME="271"></A>rightly settled to other commissioners; neither did he ever concern himself 
<A NAME="272"></A>with the distribution of the moneys; whereas Caius always took the principal 
<A NAME="273"></A>part in any important transactions of this kind. Rubrius, another tribune 
<A NAME="274"></A>of the people, had proposed to have Carthage again inhabited, which had 
<A NAME="275"></A>been demolished by Scipio, and it fell to Caius's lot to see this performed, 
<A NAME="276"></A>and for that purpose he sailed to Africa. Drusus took this opportunity 
<A NAME="277"></A>of his absence to insinuate himself still more into the people's affections, 
<A NAME="278"></A>which he did chiefly by accusing Fulvius, who was a particular friend to 
<A NAME="279"></A>Caius, and was appointed a commissioner with him for the division of the 
<A NAME="280"></A>lands. Fulvius was a man of a turbulent spirit; and notoriously hated by 
<A NAME="281"></A>the senate; and besides, he was suspected by others to have fomented the 
<A NAME="282"></A>difference between the citizens and their confederates, and underhand to 
<A NAME="283"></A>be inciting the Italians to rebel; though there was little other evidence 
<A NAME="284"></A>of the truth of these accusations than his being an unsettled character 
<A NAME="285"></A>and of a well-known seditious temper. This was one principal cause of Caius's 
<A NAME="286"></A>ruin; for part of the envy which fell upon Fulvius was extended to him. 
<A NAME="287"></A>And when Scipio Africanus died suddenly, and no cause of such an unexpected 
<A NAME="288"></A>death could be assigned, only some marks of blows upon his body seemed 
<A NAME="289"></A>to intimate that he had suffered violence, as is related in the history 
<A NAME="290"></A>of his life, the greatest part of the odium attached to Fulvius, because 
<A NAME="291"></A>he was his enemy, and that very day had reflected upon Scipio in a public 
<A NAME="292"></A>address to the people. Nor was Caius himself clear from suspicion. However, 
<A NAME="293"></A>this great outrage, committed too upon the person of the greatest and most 
<A NAME="294"></A>considerable man in Rome, was never either punished or inquired into thoroughly, 
<A NAME="295"></A>for the populace opposed and hindered any judicial investigation, for fear 
<A NAME="296"></A>that Caius should be implicated in the charge if proceedings were carried 
<A NAME="297"></A>on. This, however, had happened some time before.
<A NAME="298"></A><BR><BR>But in Africa, where at present Caius was engaged in the re-peopling 
<A NAME="299"></A>of Carthage, which he named Junonia, many ominous appearances, which presaged 
<A NAME="300"></A>mischief, are reported to have been sent from the gods. For a sudden gust 
<A NAME="301"></A>of wind falling upon the first standard, and the standard-bearer holding 
<A NAME="302"></A>it fast, the staff broke; another sudden storm blew away the sacrifices, 
<A NAME="303"></A>which were laid upon the altars, and carried them beyond the bounds laid 
<A NAME="304"></A>out for the city, and the wolves came and carried away the very marks that 
<A NAME="305"></A>were set up to show the boundary. Caius, notwithstanding all this, ordered 
<A NAME="306"></A>and despatched the whole business in the space of seventy days, and then 
<A NAME="307"></A>returned to Rome, understanding how Fulvius was prosecuted by Drusus, and 
<A NAME="308"></A>that the present juncture of affairs would not suffer him to be absent. 
<A NAME="309"></A>For Lucius Opimius, one who sided with the nobility, and was of no small 
<A NAME="310"></A>authority in the senate, who had formerly sued to be consul, but was repulsed 
<A NAME="311"></A>by Caius's interest, at the time when Fannius was elected, was in a fair 
<A NAME="312"></A>way now of being chosen consul, having a numerous company of supporters. 
<A NAME="313"></A>And it was generally believed, if he did obtain it, that he would wholly 
<A NAME="314"></A>ruin Caius, whose power was already in a declining condition; and the people 
<A NAME="315"></A>were not so apt to admire his actions as formerly, because there were so 
<A NAME="316"></A>many others who every day contrived new ways to please them, with which 
<A NAME="317"></A>the senate readily complied.
<A NAME="318"></A><BR><BR>After his return to Rome, he quitted his house on the Palatine 
<A NAME="319"></A>Mount, and went to live near the market-place, endeavouring to make himself 
<A NAME="320"></A>more popular in those parts, where most of the humble and poorer citizens 
<A NAME="321"></A>lived. He then brought forward the remainder of his proposed laws, as intending 
<A NAME="322"></A>to have them ratified by the popular vote; to support which a vast number 
<A NAME="323"></A>of people collected from all quarters. But the senate persuaded Fannius, 
<A NAME="324"></A>the consul, to command all persons who were not born Romans to depart the 
<A NAME="325"></A>city. A new and unusual proclamation was thereupon made, prohibiting any 
<A NAME="326"></A>of the allies or Confederates to appear at Rome during that time. Caius, 
<A NAME="327"></A>on the contrary, published an edict, accusing the consul for what he had 
<A NAME="328"></A>done, and setting forth to the Confederates, that if they would continue 
<A NAME="329"></A>upon the place, they might be assured of his assistance and protection. 
<A NAME="330"></A>However, he was not so good as his word; for though he saw one of his own 
<A NAME="331"></A>familiar friends and companions dragged to prison by Fannius's officers, 
<A NAME="332"></A>he, notwithstanding, passed by without assisting him; either because he 
<A NAME="333"></A>was afraid to stand the test of his power, which was already decreased, 
<A NAME="334"></A>or because, as he himself reported, he was unwilling to give his enemies 
<A NAME="335"></A>an opportunity, which they very much desired, of coming to actual violence 
<A NAME="336"></A>and fighting. About that time there happened likewise a difference between 
<A NAME="337"></A>him and his fellow-officers upon this occasion. A show of gladiators was 
<A NAME="338"></A>to be exhibited before the people in the market-place, and most of the 
<A NAME="339"></A>magistrates erected scaffolds round about, with an intention of letting 
<A NAME="340"></A>them for advantage. Caius commanded them to take down their scaffolds, 
<A NAME="341"></A>that the poor people might see the sport without paying anything. But nobody 
<A NAME="342"></A>obeying these orders of his, he gathered together a body of labourers, 
<A NAME="343"></A>who worked for him, and overthrew all the scaffolds the very night before 
<A NAME="344"></A>the contest was to take place. So that by the next morning the market-place 
<A NAME="345"></A>was cleared, and the common people had an opportunity of seeing the pastime. 
<A NAME="346"></A>In this, the populace thought he had acted the part of a man; but he much 
<A NAME="347"></A>disobliged the tribunes his colleagues, who regarded it as a piece of violent 
<A NAME="348"></A>and presumptuous interference.
<A NAME="349"></A><BR><BR>This was thought to be the chief reason that he failed of being 
<A NAME="350"></A>the third time elected tribune; not but that he had the most votes, but 
<A NAME="351"></A>because his, colleagues out of revenge caused false returns to be made. 
<A NAME="352"></A>But as to this matter there was a controversy. Certain it is, he very much 
<A NAME="353"></A>resented this repulse, and behaved with unusual arrogance towards some 
<A NAME="354"></A>of his adversaries who were joyful at his defeat, telling them that all 
<A NAME="355"></A>this was but a false sardonic mirth, as they little knew how much his actions 
<A NAME="356"></A>threw them into obscurity.
<A NAME="357"></A><BR><BR>As soon as Opimius also was chosen consul, they presently cancelled 
<A NAME="358"></A>several of Caius's laws, and especially called in question his proceedings 
<A NAME="359"></A>at Carthage, omitting nothing that was likely to irritate him, that from 
<A NAME="360"></A>some effect of his passion they might find out a tolerable pretence to 
<A NAME="361"></A>put him to death. Caius at first bore these things very patiently; but 
<A NAME="362"></A>afterwards, at the instigation of his friends, especially Fulvius, he resolved 
<A NAME="363"></A>to put himself at the head of a body of supporters, to oppose the consul 
<A NAME="364"></A>by force. They say also that on this occasion his mother, Cornelia, joined 
<A NAME="365"></A>in the sedition, and assisted him by sending privately several strangers 
<A NAME="366"></A>into Rome, under pretence as if they came to be hired there for harvest-men; 
<A NAME="367"></A>for that intimations of this are given in her letters to him. However, 
<A NAME="368"></A>it is confidently affirmed by others that Cornelia did not in the least 
<A NAME="369"></A>approve of these actions.
<A NAME="370"></A><BR><BR>When the day came in which Opimius designed to abrogate the laws 
<A NAME="371"></A>of Caius, both parties met very early at the capitol; and the consul having 
<A NAME="372"></A>performed all the rites usual in their sacrifices, one Quintus Antyllius, 
<A NAME="373"></A>an attendant on the consul, carrying out the entrails of the victim, spoke 
<A NAME="374"></A>to Fulvius, and his friends who stood about him, "Ye factious citizens, 
<A NAME="375"></A>make way for honest men." Some report that, besides this provoking language, 
<A NAME="376"></A>he extended his naked arm towards them, as a piece of scorn and contempt. 
<A NAME="377"></A>Upon this he was presently killed with the strong stiles which are commonly 
<A NAME="378"></A>used in writing, though some say that on this occasion they had been manufactured 
<A NAME="379"></A>for this purpose only. This murder caused a sudden consternation in the 
<A NAME="380"></A>whole assembly, and the heads of each faction had their different sentiments 
<A NAME="381"></A>about it. As for Caius, he was much grieved, and severely reprimanded his 
<A NAME="382"></A>own party, because they had given their adversaries a reasonable pretence 
<A NAME="383"></A>to proceed against them, which they had so long hoped for. Opimius, immediately 
<A NAME="384"></A>seizing the occasion thus offered, was in great delight, and urged the 
<A NAME="385"></A>people to revenge; but there happening a great shower of rain on a sudden, 
<A NAME="386"></A>it put an end to the business of that day.
<A NAME="387"></A><BR><BR>Early the next morning, the consul summoned the senate, and whilst 
<A NAME="388"></A>he advised with the senators in the senate-house, the corpse of Antyllius 
<A NAME="389"></A>was laid upon a bier, and brought through the market-place there exposed 
<A NAME="390"></A>to open view, just before the senate-house, with a great deal of crying 
<A NAME="391"></A>and lamentation. Opimius was not at all ignorant that this was designed 
<A NAME="392"></A>to be done; however, he seemed to be surprised, and wondered what the meaning 
<A NAME="393"></A>of it should be; the senators, therefore, presently went out to know the 
<A NAME="394"></A>occasion of it, and, standing about the corpse, uttered exclamations against 
<A NAME="395"></A>the inhuman and barbarous act. The people, meantime, could not but feel 
<A NAME="396"></A>resentment and hatred for the senators, remembering how they themselves 
<A NAME="397"></A>had not only assassinated Tiberius Gracchus, as he was executing his office 
<A NAME="398"></A>in the very capitol, but had also thrown his mangled body into the river; 
<A NAME="399"></A>yet now they could honour with their presence and their public lamentations 
<A NAME="400"></A>in the forum the corpse of an ordinary hired attendant (who, though he 
<A NAME="401"></A>might perhaps die wrongfully, was, however, in a great measure the occasion 
<A NAME="402"></A>of it himself), by these means hoping to undermine him who was the only 
<A NAME="403"></A>remaining defender and safeguard of the people.
<A NAME="404"></A><BR><BR>The senators, after some time, withdrew, and presently ordered 
<A NAME="405"></A>that Opimius, the consul, should be invested with extraordinary power to 
<A NAME="406"></A>protect the commonwealth and suppress all tyrants. This being decreed, 
<A NAME="407"></A>he presently commanded the senators to arm themselves, and the Roman knights 
<A NAME="408"></A>to be in readiness very early the next morning, and every one of them to 
<A NAME="409"></A>be attended with two servants well armed Fulvius, on the other side, made 
<A NAME="410"></A>his preparations and collected the populace. Caius at that time returning 
<A NAME="411"></A>from the market-place, made a stop just before his father's statue, and 
<A NAME="412"></A>fixing his eyes for some time upon it, remained in a deep contemplation; 
<A NAME="413"></A>at length he sighed, shed tears, and departed. This made no small impression 
<A NAME="414"></A>upon those who saw it, and they began to upbraid themselves that they should 
<A NAME="415"></A>desert and betray so worthy a man as Caius. They therefore went directly 
<A NAME="416"></A>to his house, remaining there as a guard about it all night, though in 
<A NAME="417"></A>a different manner from those who were a guard to Fulvius; for they passed 
<A NAME="418"></A>away the night with shouting and drinking, and Fulvius himself, being the 
<A NAME="419"></A>first to get drunk, spoke and acted many things very unbecoming a man of 
<A NAME="420"></A>his age and character. On the other side, the party which guarded Caius, 
<A NAME="421"></A>were quiet and diligent, relieving one another by turns, and forecasting, 
<A NAME="422"></A>as in a public what the issue of things might be. As soon as daylight appeared, 
<A NAME="423"></A>they Fulvius, who had not yet slept off the effects of his drinking; and 
<A NAME="424"></A>armed themselves with the weapons hung up in his house, that were formerly 
<A NAME="425"></A>taken from the Gauls, whom he conquered in the time of his consulship, 
<A NAME="426"></A>they presently, with threats and loud acclamations, made their way towards 
<A NAME="427"></A>the Aventine Mount.
<A NAME="428"></A><BR><BR>Caius could not be persuaded to arm himself, but put on his gown, 
<A NAME="429"></A>as if he had been going to the assembly of the people, only with this difference, 
<A NAME="430"></A>that under it he had then a short dagger by his side. As he was going out, 
<A NAME="431"></A>his wife came running to him at the gate, holding him with one hand, and 
<A NAME="432"></A>with the other a young child of his. She bespoke him: "Alas, Caius, I do 
<A NAME="433"></A>not now part with you to let you address the people either as a tribune 
<A NAME="434"></A>or a lawgiver, nor as if you were going to some honourable war, when, though 
<A NAME="435"></A>you might perhaps have encountered that fate which all must some time or 
<A NAME="436"></A>other submit to, yet you had left me this mitigation of my sorrow, that 
<A NAME="437"></A>my mourning was respected and honoured. You go now to expose your person 
<A NAME="438"></A>to the murderers of Tiberius, unarmed indeed, and rightly so, choosing 
<A NAME="439"></A>rather to suffer the worst of injuries than do the least yourself. But 
<A NAME="440"></A>even your very death at this time will not be serviceable to the public 
<A NAME="441"></A>good. Faction prevails; power and arms are now the only measures of justice. 
<A NAME="442"></A>Had your brother fallen before Numantia, the enemy would have given back 
<A NAME="443"></A>what then had remained of Tiberius; but such is my hard fate, that I probably 
<A NAME="444"></A>must be an humble suppliant to the floods or the waves, that they would 
<A NAME="445"></A>somewhere restore to me your relics; for since Tiberius was not spared, 
<A NAME="446"></A>what trust can we place either on the laws, or in the Gods?" Licinia, thus 
<A NAME="447"></A>bewailing, Caius, by degrees getting loose from her embraces, silently 
<A NAME="448"></A>withdrew himself, being accompanied by his friends; she, endeavouring to 
<A NAME="449"></A>catch him by the gown, fell prostrate upon the earth, lying there for some 
<A NAME="450"></A>time speechless. Her servants took her up for dead, and conveyed her to 
<A NAME="451"></A>her brother Crassus.
<A NAME="452"></A><BR><BR>Fulvius, when the people were gathered together in a full body, 
<A NAME="453"></A>by the advice of Caius sent his youngest son into the market-place, with 
<A NAME="454"></A>a herald's rod in his hand. He, being a very handsome youth, and modestly 
<A NAME="455"></A>addressing himself, with tears in his eyes and a becoming bashfulness, 
<A NAME="456"></A>offered proposals of agreement to the consul and the whole senate. The 
<A NAME="457"></A>greatest part of the assembly were inclinable to accept of the proposals; 
<A NAME="458"></A>but Opimius said, that it did not become them to send messengers and capitulate 
<A NAME="459"></A>with the senate, but to surrender at discretion to the laws, like loyal 
<A NAME="460"></A>citizens, and endeavour to merit their pardon by submission. He commanded 
<A NAME="461"></A>the youth not to return, unless they would comply with these conditions. 
<A NAME="462"></A>Caius, as it is reported, was very forward to go and clear himself before 
<A NAME="463"></A>the senate; but none of his friends consenting to it, Fulvius sent his 
<A NAME="464"></A>son a second time to intercede for them, as before. But Opimius, who was 
<A NAME="465"></A>resolved that a battle should ensue, caused the youth to be apprehended 
<A NAME="466"></A>and committed into custody; and then with a company of his foot-soldiers 
<A NAME="467"></A>and some Cretan archers set upon the party under Fulvius. These archers 
<A NAME="468"></A>did such execution, and inflicted so many wounds, that a rout and flight 
<A NAME="469"></A>quickly ensued. Fulvius fled into an obscure bathing-house; but shortly 
<A NAME="470"></A>after being discovered, he and his eldest son were slain together. Caius 
<A NAME="471"></A>was not observed to use any violence against any one; but extremely disliking 
<A NAME="472"></A>all these outrages, retired to Diana's temple. There he attempted to kill 
<A NAME="473"></A>himself, but was hindered by his faithful friends, Pomponius and Licinius; 
<A NAME="474"></A>they took his sword away from him, and were very urgent that he would endeavour 
<A NAME="475"></A>to make his escape. It is reported that, falling upon his knee and lifting 
<A NAME="476"></A>up his hands, he prayed the goddess that the Roman people, as a punishment 
<A NAME="477"></A>for their ingratitude and treachery, might always remain in slavery. For 
<A NAME="478"></A>as soon as a proclamation was made of a pardon, the greater part openly 
<A NAME="479"></A>deserted him.
<A NAME="480"></A><BR><BR>Caius, therefore, endeavoured now to make his escape, but was pursued 
<A NAME="481"></A>so close by his enemies, as far as the wooden bridge, that from thence 
<A NAME="482"></A>he narrowly escaped. There his two trusty friends begged of him to preserve 
<A NAME="483"></A>his own person by flight, whilst they in the meantime would keep their 
<A NAME="484"></A>post, and maintain the passage; neither could their enemies, until they 
<A NAME="485"></A>were both slain, pass the bridge. Caius had no other companion in his flight 
<A NAME="486"></A>but one Philocrates, a servant of his. As he ran along, everybody encouraged 
<A NAME="487"></A>him, and wished him success, as standers-by may do to those who are engaged 
<A NAME="488"></A>in a race, but nobody either lent him any assistance, or would furnish 
<A NAME="489"></A>him with a horse, though he asked for one; for his enemies had gained ground, 
<A NAME="490"></A>and got very near him. However, he had still time enough to hide himself 
<A NAME="491"></A>in a little grove, consecrated to the Furies. In that place, his servant 
<A NAME="492"></A>Philocrates having first slain him, presently afterwards killed himself 
<A NAME="493"></A>also, and fell dead upon his master. Though some affirm it for a truth, 
<A NAME="494"></A>that they were both taken alive by their enemies, and that Philocrates 
<A NAME="495"></A>embraced his master so close, that they could not wound Caius until his 
<A NAME="496"></A>servant was slain.
<A NAME="497"></A><BR><BR>They say that when Caius's head was cut off, and carried away by 
<A NAME="498"></A>one of his murderers, Septimuleius, Opimius's friend, met him, and forced 
<A NAME="499"></A>it from him; because, before the battle began, they had made proclamation, 
<A NAME="500"></A>that whoever should bring the head either of Caius or Fulvius, should, 
<A NAME="501"></A>as a reward, receive its weight in gold. Septimuleius, therefore, having 
<A NAME="502"></A>fixed Caius's head upon the top of his spear, came and presented it to 
<A NAME="503"></A>Opimius. They presently brought the scales, and it was found to weigh above 
<A NAME="504"></A>seventeen pounds. But in this affair, Septimuleius gave as great signs 
<A NAME="505"></A>of his knavery as he had done before of his cruelty; for having taken out 
<A NAME="506"></A>the brains, he had filled the skull with lead. There were others who brought 
<A NAME="507"></A>the head of Fulvius, too, but, being mean, inconsiderable persons, were 
<A NAME="508"></A>turned away without the promised reward. The bodies of these two persons, 
<A NAME="509"></A>as well as of the rest who were slain, to the number of three thousand 
<A NAME="510"></A>men, were all thrown into the river; their goods were confiscated, and 
<A NAME="511"></A>their widows forbidden to put themselves into mourning. They dealt even 
<A NAME="512"></A>more severely with Licinia, Caius's wife, and deprived her even of her 
<A NAME="513"></A>jointure; and as in addition still to all their inhumanity, they barbarously 
<A NAME="514"></A>murdered Fulvius's youngest son; his only crime being, not that he took 
<A NAME="515"></A>up arms against them, or that he was present in the battle, but merely 
<A NAME="516"></A>that he had come with articles of agreement; for this he was first imprisoned, 
<A NAME="517"></A>then slain.
<A NAME="518"></A><BR><BR>But that which angered the common people most was, that at this 
<A NAME="519"></A>time, in memory of his success, Opimius built the Temple of Concord, as 
<A NAME="520"></A>if he gloried and triumphed in the slaughter of so many citizens. Somebody 
<A NAME="521"></A>in the night time, under the inscription of the temple added this 
<A NAME="522"></A>verse:-
<A NAME="523"></A><BR><BR>"Folly and Discord Concord's temple built."
<A NAME="524"></A><BR><BR>Yet this Opimius, the first who, being consul, presumed to usurp 
<A NAME="525"></A>the power of a dictator, condemning, without any trial, with three thousand 
<A NAME="526"></A>other citizens, Caius Gracchus and Fulvius Flaccus, one of whom had triumphed 
<A NAME="527"></A>and been consul, the other far excelled all his contemporaries in virtue 
<A NAME="528"></A>and honour, afterwards was found incapable of keeping his hands from thieving: 
<A NAME="529"></A>and when he was sent ambassador to Jugurtha, King of Numidia, he was there 
<A NAME="530"></A>corrupted by presents, and at his return, being shamefully convicted of 
<A NAME="531"></A>it, lost all his honours, and grew old amidst the hatred and the insults 
<A NAME="532"></A>of the people; who, though humble, and affrighted at the time, did not 
<A NAME="533"></A>fail before long to let everybody see what respect and veneration they 
<A NAME="534"></A>had for the memory of the Gracchi. They ordered their statues to be made 
<A NAME="535"></A>and set up in public view; they consecrated the places where they were 
<A NAME="536"></A>slain, and thither brought the first-fruits of everything, according to 
<A NAME="537"></A>the season of the year, to make their offerings. Many came likewise thither 
<A NAME="538"></A>to their devotions, and daily worshipped there, as at the temple of the 
<A NAME="539"></A>gods.
<A NAME="540"></A><BR><BR>It is reported that as Cornelia, their mother, bore the loss of 
<A NAME="541"></A>her two sons with a noble and undaunted spirit, so, in reference to the 
<A NAME="542"></A>holy places in which they were slain, she said, their dead bodies were 
<A NAME="543"></A>well worthy of such sepulchres. She removed afterwards, and dwelt near 
<A NAME="544"></A>the place called Misenum, not at all altering her former way of living. 
<A NAME="545"></A>She had many friends, and hospitably received many strangers at her house; 
<A NAME="546"></A>many Greeks and learned men were continually about her; nor was there any 
<A NAME="547"></A>foreign prince but received gifts from her and presented her again. Those 
<A NAME="548"></A>who were conversant with her, were much interested, when she pleased to 
<A NAME="549"></A>entertain them with her recollections of her father Scipio Africanus, and 
<A NAME="550"></A>of his habits and way of living. But it was most admirable to hear her 
<A NAME="551"></A>make mention of her sons, without any tears or sign of grief, and give 
<A NAME="552"></A>the full account of all their deeds and misfortunes, as if she had been 
<A NAME="553"></A>relating the history of some ancient heroes. This made some imagine, that 
<A NAME="554"></A>age, or the greatness of her afflictions, had made her senseless and devoid 
<A NAME="555"></A>of natural feelings. But they who so thought were themselves more truly 
<A NAME="556"></A>insensible not to see how much a noble nature and education avail to conquer 
<A NAME="557"></A>any affliction; and though fortune may often be more successful, and may 
<A NAME="558"></A>defeat the efforts of virtue to avert misfortunes, it cannot, when we incur 
<A NAME="559"></A>them, prevent our hearing them reasonably.
