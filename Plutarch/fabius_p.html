<A NAME="2"></A><BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>We have here had two lives rich in examples, both of civil and military 
<A NAME="11"></A>excellence. Let us first compare the two men in their warlike capacity. 
<A NAME="12"></A>Pericles presided in his commonwealth when it was in its most flourishing 
<A NAME="13"></A>and opulent condition, great and growing in power; so that it may be thought 
<A NAME="14"></A>it was rather the common success and fortune that kept him from any fall 
<A NAME="15"></A>or disaster. But the task of Fabius, who undertook the government in the 
<A NAME="16"></A>worst and most difficult times, was not to preserve and maintain the well-established 
<A NAME="17"></A>felicity of a prosperous state, but to raise and uphold a sinking and ruinous 
<A NAME="18"></A>commonwealth. Besides, the victories of Cimon, the trophies of Myronides 
<A NAME="19"></A>and Leocrates, with the many famous exploits of Tolmides, were employed 
<A NAME="20"></A>by Pericles rather to fill the city with festive entertainments and solemnities 
<A NAME="21"></A>than to enlarge and secure its empire. Whereas, Fabius, when he took upon 
<A NAME="22"></A>him the government, had the frightful object before his eyes of Roman armies 
<A NAME="23"></A>destroyed, of their generals and consuls slain, of lakes and plains and 
<A NAME="24"></A>forests strewed with the dead bodies, and rivers stained with the blood 
<A NAME="25"></A>of his fellow-citizens; and yet, with his mature and solid counsels, with 
<A NAME="26"></A>the firmness of his resolution, he, as it were, put his shoulder to the 
<A NAME="27"></A>falling commonwealth, and kept it up from foundering through the failings 
<A NAME="28"></A>and weaknesses of others. Perhaps it may be more easy to govern a city 
<A NAME="29"></A>broken and tamed with calamities and adversity, and compelled by danger 
<A NAME="30"></A>and necessity to listen to wisdom, than to set a bridle on wantonness and 
<A NAME="31"></A>temerity, and rule a people pampered and restive with long prosperity as 
<A NAME="32"></A>were the Athenians when Pericles held the reins of government. But then 
<A NAME="33"></A>again, not to be daunted nor discomposed with the vast heap of calamities 
<A NAME="34"></A>under which the people of Rome at that time groaned and succumbed, argues 
<A NAME="35"></A>a courage in Fabius and a strength of purpose more than 
<A NAME="36"></A>ordinary.
<A NAME="37"></A><BR><BR>We may set Tarentum retaken against Samos won by Pericles, and 
<A NAME="38"></A>the conquest of Euboea we may well balance with the towns of Campania; 
<A NAME="39"></A>though Capua itself was reduced by the consuls Fulvius and Appius. I do 
<A NAME="40"></A>not find that Fabius won any set battle but that against the Ligurians, 
<A NAME="41"></A>for which he had his triumph; whereas Pericles erected nine trophies for 
<A NAME="42"></A>as many victories obtained by land and by sea. But no action of Pericles 
<A NAME="43"></A>can be compared to that memorable rescue of Minucius, when Fabius redeemed 
<A NAME="44"></A>both him and his army from utter destruction; a noble act combining the 
<A NAME="45"></A>highest valour, wisdom, and humanity. On the other side, it does not appear 
<A NAME="46"></A>that Pericles was ever so overreached as Fabius was by Hannibal with his 
<A NAME="47"></A>flaming oxen. His enemy there had, without his agency, put himself accidentally 
<A NAME="48"></A>into his power, yet Fabius let him slip in the night, and, when day came, 
<A NAME="49"></A>was worsted by him, was anticipated in the moment of success, and mastered 
<A NAME="50"></A>by his prisoner. If it is the part of a good general, not only to provide 
<A NAME="51"></A>for the present, but also to have a clear foresight of things to come, 
<A NAME="52"></A>in this point Pericles is the superior; for he admonished the Athenians, 
<A NAME="53"></A>and told them beforehand the ruin the war would bring upon them, by their 
<A NAME="54"></A>grasping more than they were able to manage. But Fabius was not so good 
<A NAME="55"></A>a prophet, when he denounced to the Romans that the undertaking of Scipio 
<A NAME="56"></A>would be the destruction of the commonwealth. So that Pericles was a good 
<A NAME="57"></A>prophet of bad success, and Fabius was a bad prophet of success that was 
<A NAME="58"></A>good. And, indeed, to lose an advantage through diffidence is no less blamable 
<A NAME="59"></A>in a general than to fall into danger for want of foresight; for both these 
<A NAME="60"></A>faults, though of a contrary nature, spring from the same root, want of 
<A NAME="61"></A>judgment and experience.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR>As for their civil policy, it is imputed to Pericles that he occasioned 
<A NAME="63"></A>the war, since no terms of peace, offered by the Lacedaemonians, would 
<A NAME="64"></A>content him. It is true, I presume, that Fabius, also, was not for yielding 
<A NAME="65"></A>any point to the Carthaginians, but was ready to hazard all, rather than 
<A NAME="66"></A>lessen the empire of Rome. The mildness of Fabius towards his colleague 
<A NAME="67"></A>Minucius does, by way of comparison, rebuke and condemn the exertions of 
<A NAME="68"></A>Pericles to banish Cimon and Thucydides, noble, aristocratic men, who by 
<A NAME="69"></A>his means suffered ostracism. The authority of Pericles in Athens was much 
<A NAME="70"></A>greater than that of Fabius in Rome. Hence it was more easy for him to 
<A NAME="71"></A>prevent miscarriages arising from the mistakes and insufficiency of other 
<A NAME="72"></A>officers; only Tolmides broke loose from him, and, contrary to his persuasions, 
<A NAME="73"></A>unadvisedly fought with the Boeotians, and was slain. The greatness of 
<A NAME="74"></A>his influence made all others submit and conform themselves to his judgment. 
<A NAME="75"></A>Whereas Fabius, sure and unerring himself, for want of that general power, 
<A NAME="76"></A>had not the means to obviate the miscarriages of others; but it had been 
<A NAME="77"></A>happy for the Romans if his authority had been greater, for so, we may 
<A NAME="78"></A>presume, their disasters had been fewer.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>As to liberality and public spirit, Pericles was eminent in never 
<A NAME="80"></A>taking any gifts, and Fabius, for giving his own money to ransom his soldiers, 
<A NAME="81"></A>though the sum did not exceed six talents. Than Pericles, meantime, no 
<A NAME="82"></A>man had ever greater opportunities to enrich himself, having had presents 
<A NAME="83"></A>offered him from so many kings and princes and allies, yet no man was ever 
<A NAME="84"></A>more free from corruption. And for the beauty and magnificence of temples 
<A NAME="85"></A>and public edifices with which he adorned his country, it must be confessed, 
<A NAME="86"></A>that all the ornaments and structures of Rome, to the time of the Caesars, 
<A NAME="87"></A>had nothing to compare, either in greatness of design or of expense, with 
<A NAME="88"></A>the lustre of those which Pericles only erected at Athens.
