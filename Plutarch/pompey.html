<BR>(legendary, died 48 B.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>The people of Rome seem to have entertained for Pompey from his childhood 
<A NAME="11"></A>the same affection that Prometheus, in the tragedy of Aeschylus, expresses 
<A NAME="12"></A>for Hercules, speaking of him as the author of his deliverance, in these 
<A NAME="13"></A>words:-
<A NAME="14"></A><BR><BR>"Ah cruel Sire! how dear thy son to me!
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>The generous offspring of my enemy!" For on the one hand, never did 
<A NAME="16"></A>the Romans give such demonstrations of a vehement and fierce hatred against 
<A NAME="17"></A>any of their generals as they did against Strabo, the father of Pompey; 
<A NAME="18"></A>during whose lifetime, it is true, they stood in awe of his military power, 
<A NAME="19"></A>as indeed he was a formidable warrior, but immediately upon his death, 
<A NAME="20"></A>which happened by a stroke of thunder, they treated him with the utmost 
<A NAME="21"></A>contumely, dragging his corpse from the bier, as it was carried to his 
<A NAME="22"></A>funeral. On the other side, never had any Roman the people's good-will 
<A NAME="23"></A>and devotion more zealous throughout all the changes of fortune, more early 
<A NAME="24"></A>in its first springing up, or more steadily rising with his prosperity, 
<A NAME="25"></A>or more constant in his adversity than Pompey had. In Strabo, there was 
<A NAME="26"></A>one great cause of their hatred, his insatiable covetousness; in Pompey, 
<A NAME="27"></A>there were many that helped to make him the object of their love; his temperance, 
<A NAME="28"></A>his skill and exercise in war, his eloquence of speech, integrity of mind, 
<A NAME="29"></A>and affability in conversation and address; insomuch that no man ever asked 
<A NAME="30"></A>a favour with less offence, or conferred one with a better grace. When 
<A NAME="31"></A>he gave, it was without assumption; when he received, it was with dignity 
<A NAME="32"></A>and honour.
<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR>In his youth, his countenance pleaded for him, seeming to anticipate 
<A NAME="34"></A>his eloquence, and win upon the affections of the people before he spoke. 
<A NAME="35"></A>His beauty even in his bloom of youth had something in it at once of gentleness 
<A NAME="36"></A>and dignity; and when his prime of manhood came, the majesty and kingliness 
<A NAME="37"></A>of his character at once became visible in it. His hair sat somewhat hollow 
<A NAME="38"></A>or rising a little; and this, with the languishing motion of his eyes, 
<A NAME="39"></A>seemed to form a resemblance in his face, though perhaps more talked of 
<A NAME="40"></A>than really apparent, to the statues of the King Alexander. And because 
<A NAME="41"></A>many applied that name to him in his youth, Pompey himself did not decline 
<A NAME="42"></A>it, insomuch that some called him so in derision. And Lucius Philippus, 
<A NAME="43"></A>a man of consular dignity, when he was pleading in favour of him, thought 
<A NAME="44"></A>it not unfit to say, that people could not be surprised if Philip was a 
<A NAME="45"></A>lover of Alexander.
<A NAME="46"></A><BR><BR>It is related of Flora, the courtesan, that when she was now pretty 
<A NAME="47"></A>old, she took great delight in speaking of her early familiarity with Pompey, 
<A NAME="48"></A>and was wont to say that she could never part after being with him without 
<A NAME="49"></A>a bite. She would further tell, that Geminius, a companion of Pompey's, 
<A NAME="50"></A>fell in love with her, and made his court with great importunity; and on 
<A NAME="51"></A>her refusing, and telling him, however her inclinations were, yet she could 
<A NAME="52"></A>not gratify his desires for Pompey's sake, he therefore made his request 
<A NAME="53"></A>to Pompey, and Pompey frankly gave his consent, but never afterwards would 
<A NAME="54"></A>have any converse with her, notwithstanding that he seemed to have a great 
<A NAME="55"></A>passion for her; and Flora, on this occasion, showed none of the levity 
<A NAME="56"></A>that might have been expected of her, but languished for some time after 
<A NAME="57"></A>under a sickness brought on by grief and desire. This Flora, we are told, 
<A NAME="58"></A>was such a celebrated beauty, that Caecilius Metellus, when he adorned 
<A NAME="59"></A>the temple of Castor and Pollux with paintings and statues, among the rest 
<A NAME="60"></A>dedicated hers for her singular beauty. In his conduct also to the wife 
<A NAME="61"></A>of Demetrius, his freed servant (who had great influence with him in his 
<A NAME="62"></A>lifetime, and left an estate of four thousand talents), Pompey acted contrary 
<A NAME="63"></A>to his usual habits, not quite fairly or generously, fearing lest he should 
<A NAME="64"></A>fall under the common censure of being enamoured and charmed with her beauty, 
<A NAME="65"></A>which was irresistible, and became famous everywhere. Nevertheless, though 
<A NAME="66"></A>he seemed to be so extremely circumspect and cautious, yet even in matters 
<A NAME="67"></A>of this nature he could not avoid the calumnies of his enemies, but upon 
<A NAME="68"></A>the score of married women, they accused him, as if he had connived at 
<A NAME="69"></A>many things, and embezzled the public revenue to gratify their 
<A NAME="70"></A>luxury.
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>Of his easiness of temper and plainness, in what related to eating 
<A NAME="72"></A>and drinking, the story is told that, once in a sickness, when his stomach 
<A NAME="73"></A>nauseated common meats, his physician prescribed him a thrush to eat; but 
<A NAME="74"></A>upon search, there was none to be bought, for they were not then in season, 
<A NAME="75"></A>and one telling him they were to be had at Lucullus's, who kept them all 
<A NAME="76"></A>the year round, "So then," said he, "if it were not for Lucullus's luxury, 
<A NAME="77"></A>Pompey should not live;" and thereupon, not minding the prescription of 
<A NAME="78"></A>the physician, he contented himself with such meat as could easily be procured. 
<A NAME="79"></A>But this was at a later time.
<A NAME="80"></A><BR><BR>Being as yet a very young man, and upon an expedition in which 
<A NAME="81"></A>his father was commanding against Cinna, he had in his tent with him one 
<A NAME="82"></A>Lucius Terentius, as his companion and comrade, who, being corrupted by 
<A NAME="83"></A>Cinna, entered into an engagement to kill Pompey, as others had done to 
<A NAME="84"></A>set the general's tent on fire. This conspiracy being discovered to Pompey 
<A NAME="85"></A>at supper, he showed no discomposure at it, but on the contrary drank more 
<A NAME="86"></A>liberally than usual, and expressed great kindness to Terentius; but about 
<A NAME="87"></A>bedtime, pretending to go to his repose, he stole away secretly out of 
<A NAME="88"></A>the tent, and setting a guard about his father, quietly expected the event. 
<A NAME="89"></A>Terentius, when he thought the proper time come, rose with his naked sword, 
<A NAME="90"></A>and coming to Pompey's bedside stabbed several strokes through the bedclothes, 
<A NAME="91"></A>as if he were lying there. Immediately after this there was a great uproar 
<A NAME="92"></A>throughout all the camp, arising from the hatred they bore to the general, 
<A NAME="93"></A>and an universal movement of the soldiers to revolt, all tearing down their 
<A NAME="94"></A>tents and betaking themselves to their arms. The general himself all this 
<A NAME="95"></A>while durst not venture out because of the tumult; but Pompey, going about 
<A NAME="96"></A>in the midst of them, besought them with tears; and at last threw himself 
<A NAME="97"></A>prostrate upon his face before the gate of the camp, and lay there in the 
<A NAME="98"></A>passage at their feet shedding tears, and bidding those that were marching 
<A NAME="99"></A>off, if they would go, trample upon him. Upon which, none could help going 
<A NAME="100"></A>back again, and all, except eight hundred, either through shame or compassion, 
<A NAME="101"></A>repented, and were reconciled to the general.
<A NAME="102"></A><BR><BR>Immediately upon the death of Strabo, there was an action commenced 
<A NAME="103"></A>against Pompey, as his heir, for that his father had embezzled the public 
<A NAME="104"></A>treasure. But Pompey, having traced the principal thefts, charged them 
<A NAME="105"></A>upon one Alexander, a freed slave of his father's, and proved before the 
<A NAME="106"></A>judges that he had been the appropriator. But he himself was accused of 
<A NAME="107"></A>having in his possession some hunting tackle, and books, that were taken 
<A NAME="108"></A>at Asculum. To this he confessed thus far, that he received them from his 
<A NAME="109"></A>father when he took Asculum, but pleaded further, that he had lost them 
<A NAME="110"></A>since, upon Cinna's return to Rome, when his house was broken open and 
<A NAME="111"></A>plundered by Cinna's guards. In this cause he had a great many preparatory 
<A NAME="112"></A>pleadings against his accuser, in which he showed in activity and steadfastness 
<A NAME="113"></A>beyond his years, and gained great reputation and favour, insomuch that 
<A NAME="114"></A>Antistius, the praetor and judge of the cause, took a great liking to him, 
<A NAME="115"></A>and offered him his daughter in marriage, having had some communications 
<A NAME="116"></A>with his friends about it. Pompey accepted the proposal, and they were 
<A NAME="117"></A>privately contracted; however, the secret was not so closely kept as to 
<A NAME="118"></A>escape the multitude, but it was discernible enough, from the favour shown 
<A NAME="119"></A>him by Antistius in his cause. And at last, when Antistius pronounced the 
<A NAME="120"></A>absolutory sentence of the judges, the people, as if it had been upon a 
<A NAME="121"></A>signal given, made the acclamation used according to ancient custom at 
<A NAME="122"></A>marriages, Talasio. The origin of which custom is related to be this. At 
<A NAME="123"></A>the time when the daughters of the Sabines came to Rome, to see the shows 
<A NAME="124"></A>and sports there, and were violently seized upon by the most distinguished 
<A NAME="125"></A>and bravest of the Romans for wives, it happened that some goatswains and 
<A NAME="126"></A>herdsmen of the meaner rank were carrying off a beautiful and tall maiden; 
<A NAME="127"></A>and lest any of their betters should meet them, and take her away, as they 
<A NAME="128"></A>ran, they cried out with one voice, Talasio, Talasius being a well-known 
<A NAME="129"></A>and popular person among them, insomuch that all that heard the name clapped 
<A NAME="130"></A>their hands for joy, and joined with them in the shout, as applauding and 
<A NAME="131"></A>congratulating the chance. Now, say they, because this proved a fortunate 
<A NAME="132"></A>match to Talasius, hence it is that this acclamation is sportively used 
<A NAME="133"></A>as a nuptial cry at all weddings. This is the most credible of the accounts 
<A NAME="134"></A>that are given of the Talasio. And some few days after this judgment, Pompey 
<A NAME="135"></A>married Antistia.
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>After this he went to Cinna's camp, where, finding some false suggestions 
<A NAME="137"></A>and calumnies prevailing against him, he began to be afraid, and presently 
<A NAME="138"></A>withdrew himself secretly which sudden disappearance occasioned great suspicion. 
<A NAME="139"></A>And there went a rumour and speech through all the camp that Cinna had 
<A NAME="140"></A>murdered the young man; upon which all that had been anyways disobliged, 
<A NAME="141"></A>and bore any malice to him, resolved to make an assault upon him. He, endeavouring 
<A NAME="142"></A>to make his escape, was seized by a centurion, who pursued him with his 
<A NAME="143"></A>naked sword. Cinna, in this distress, fell upon his knees, and offered 
<A NAME="144"></A>him his seal-ring, of great value, for his ransom; but the centurion repulsed 
<A NAME="145"></A>him insolently, saying, "I did not come to seal a covenant, but to be revenged 
<A NAME="146"></A>upon a lawless and wicked tyrant;" and so despatched him 
<A NAME="147"></A>immediately.
<A NAME="148"></A><BR><BR>Thus Cinna being slain, Carbo, a tyrant yet more senseless than 
<A NAME="149"></A>he, took the command and exercised it, while Sylla meantime was approaching, 
<A NAME="150"></A>much to the joy and satisfaction of most people, who in their present evils 
<A NAME="151"></A>were ready to find some comfort if it were but in the exchange of a master. 
<A NAME="152"></A>For the city was brought to that pass by oppression and calamities that, 
<A NAME="153"></A>being utterly in despair of liberty, men were only anxious for the mildest 
<A NAME="154"></A>and most tolerable bondage. At that time Pompey was in Picenum in Italy, 
<A NAME="155"></A>where he spent some time amusing himself, as he had estates in the country 
<A NAME="156"></A>there, though the chief motive of his stay was the liking he felt for the 
<A NAME="157"></A>towns of that district, which all regarded him with hereditary feelings 
<A NAME="158"></A>of kindness and attachment. But when he now saw that the noblest and best 
<A NAME="159"></A>of the city began to forsake their homes and property, and fly from all 
<A NAME="160"></A>quarters to Sylla's camp, as to their haven, he likewise was desirous to 
<A NAME="161"></A>go; not, however, as a fugitive, alone and with nothing to offer, but as 
<A NAME="162"></A>a friend rather than a suppliant, in a way that would gain him honour, 
<A NAME="163"></A>bringing help along with him, and at the head of a body of troops. Accordingly 
<A NAME="164"></A>he solicited the Picentines for their assistance, who as cordially embraced 
<A NAME="165"></A>his motion, and rejected the messengers sent from Carbo; insomuch that 
<A NAME="166"></A>a certain Vindius taking upon him to say that Pompey was come from the 
<A NAME="167"></A>school-room to put himself at the head of the people, they were so incensed 
<A NAME="168"></A>that they fell forthwith upon this Vindius and killed 
<A NAME="169"></A>him.
<A NAME="170"></A><BR><BR>From henceforward Pompey, finding a spirit of government upon him, 
<A NAME="171"></A>though not above twenty-three years of age, nor deriving an authority by 
<A NAME="172"></A>commission from any man, took the privilege to grant himself full power, 
<A NAME="173"></A>and, causing a tribunal to be erected in the market-place of Auximum, a 
<A NAME="174"></A>populous city, expelled two of their principal men, brothers, of the name 
<A NAME="175"></A>of Ventidius, who were acting against him in Carbo's interest, commanding 
<A NAME="176"></A>them by a public edict to depart the city; and then proceeding to levy 
<A NAME="177"></A>soldiers, issuing out commissions to centurions and other officers, according 
<A NAME="178"></A>to the form of military discipline. And in this manner he went round all 
<A NAME="179"></A>the rest of the cities in the district. So that those of Carbo's faction 
<A NAME="180"></A>flying, and all others cheerfully submitting to his command, in a little 
<A NAME="181"></A>time he mustered three entire legions, having supplied himself besides 
<A NAME="182"></A>with all manner of provisions, beasts of burden, carriages, and other necessaries 
<A NAME="183"></A>of war. And with this equipage he set forward on his march toward Sylla, 
<A NAME="184"></A>not as if he were in haste, or desirous of escaping observation, but by 
<A NAME="185"></A>small journeys, making several halts upon the road, to distress and annoy 
<A NAME="186"></A>the enemy, and exerting himself to detach from Carbo's interest every part 
<A NAME="187"></A>of Italy that he passed through.
<A NAME="188"></A><BR><BR>Three commanders of the enemy encountered him at once, Carinna, 
<A NAME="189"></A>Cloelius, and Brutus, and drew up their forces, not all in the front, nor 
<A NAME="190"></A>yet together on any one part, but encamping three several armies in a circle 
<A NAME="191"></A>about him, they resolved to encompass and overpower him. Pompey was noway 
<A NAME="192"></A>alarmed at this, but collecting all his troops into one body, and placing 
<A NAME="193"></A>his horse in the front of the battle, where he himself was in person, he 
<A NAME="194"></A>singled out and bent all his forces against Brutus, and when the Celtic 
<A NAME="195"></A>horsemen from the enemy's side rode out to meet him, Pompey himself encountering 
<A NAME="196"></A>hand to hand with the foremost and stoutest among them, killed him with 
<A NAME="197"></A>his spear. The rest seeing this turned their backs and fled, and breaking 
<A NAME="198"></A>the ranks of their own foot, presently caused a general rout; whereupon 
<A NAME="199"></A>the commanders fell out among themselves, and marched off, some one way, 
<A NAME="200"></A>some another, as their fortunes led them, and the town; round about came 
<A NAME="201"></A>in and surrendered themselves to Pompey, concluding that the enemy was 
<A NAME="202"></A>dispersed for fear. Next after these, Scipio, the consul, came to attack 
<A NAME="203"></A>him, and with as little success; for before the armies could join, or be 
<A NAME="204"></A>within the throw of their javelins, Scipio's soldiers saluted Pompey's, 
<A NAME="205"></A>and came over to them, while Scipio made his escape by flight. Last of 
<A NAME="206"></A>all, Carbo himself sent down several troops of horse against him by the 
<A NAME="207"></A>river Arsis, which Pompey assailed with the same courage and success as 
<A NAME="208"></A>before; and having routed and put them to flight, he forced them in the 
<A NAME="209"></A>pursuit into difficult ground, unpassable for horse, where, seeing no hopes 
<A NAME="210"></A>of escape, they yielded themselves with their horses and armour, all to 
<A NAME="211"></A>his mercy.
<A NAME="212"></A><BR><BR>Sylla was hitherto unacquainted with all these actions; and on 
<A NAME="213"></A>the first intelligence he received of his movements was in great anxiety 
<A NAME="214"></A>about him, fearing lest he should be cut off among so many and such experienced 
<A NAME="215"></A>commanders of the enemy, and marched therefore with all speed to his aid. 
<A NAME="216"></A>Now Pompey, having advice of his approach, sent out orders to his officers 
<A NAME="217"></A>to marshal and draw up all his forces in full array, that they might make 
<A NAME="218"></A>the finest and noblest appearance before the commander-in-chief; for he 
<A NAME="219"></A>expected indeed great honours from him, but met with even greater. For 
<A NAME="220"></A>as soon as Sylla saw him thus advancing, his army so well appointed, his 
<A NAME="221"></A>men so young and strong, and their spirits so high and hopeful with their 
<A NAME="222"></A>successes, he alighted from his horse, and being first, as was his due, 
<A NAME="223"></A>saluted by them with the title of Imperator, he returned the salutation 
<A NAME="224"></A>upon Pompey, in the same term and style of Imperator, which might well 
<A NAME="225"></A>cause surprise, as none could have ever anticipated that he would have 
<A NAME="226"></A>imparted, to one so young in years and not yet a senator, a title which 
<A NAME="227"></A>was the object of contention between him and the Scipios and Marii. And 
<A NAME="228"></A>indeed all the rest of his deportment was agreeable to this first compliment; 
<A NAME="229"></A>whenever Pompey came into his presence, he paid some sort of respect to 
<A NAME="230"></A>him, either in rising and being uncovered, or the like, which he was rarely 
<A NAME="231"></A>seen to do with any one else, notwithstanding that there were many about 
<A NAME="232"></A>him of great rank and honour. Yet Pompey was not puffed up at all, or exalted 
<A NAME="233"></A>with these favours. And when Sylla would have sent him with all expedition 
<A NAME="234"></A>into Gaul, a province in which it was thought Metellus, who commanded in 
<A NAME="235"></A>it, had done nothing worthy of the large forces at his disposal, Pompey 
<A NAME="236"></A>urged that it could not be fair or honourable for him to take a province 
<A NAME="237"></A>out of the hands of his senior in command and his superior in reputation; 
<A NAME="238"></A>however, if Metellus were willing, and should request his service, he should 
<A NAME="239"></A>be very ready to accompany and assist him in the war, which when Metellus 
<A NAME="240"></A>came to understand, he approved of the proposal, and invited him over by 
<A NAME="241"></A>letter. On this Pompey fell immediately into Gaul, where he not only achieved 
<A NAME="242"></A>wonderful exploits of himself, but also fired up and kindled again that 
<A NAME="243"></A>bold and warlike spirit, which old age had in a manner extinguished in 
<A NAME="244"></A>Metellus, into a new heat; just as molten copper, they say, when poured 
<A NAME="245"></A>upon that which is cold and solid, will dissolve and melt it faster than 
<A NAME="246"></A>fire itself. But as when a famous wrestler has gained the first place among 
<A NAME="247"></A>men, and borne away the prizes at all the games, it is not usual to take 
<A NAME="248"></A>account of his victories as a boy, or to enter them upon record among the 
<A NAME="249"></A>rest; so with the exploits of Pompey in his youth, though they were extraordinary 
<A NAME="250"></A>in themselves, yet because they were obscured and buried in the multitude 
<A NAME="251"></A>and greatness of his later wars and conquests, I dare not be particular 
<A NAME="252"></A>in them, lest, by trifling away time in the lesser moments of his youth, 
<A NAME="253"></A>we should be driven to omit those greater actions and fortunes which best 
<A NAME="254"></A>illustrate his character.
<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR>Now, when Sylla had brought all Italy under his dominion, and was 
<A NAME="256"></A>proclaimed dictator, he began to reward the rest of his followers, by giving 
<A NAME="257"></A>them wealth, appointing them to offices in the state, and granting them 
<A NAME="258"></A>freely and without restriction any favours they asked for. But as for Pompey, 
<A NAME="259"></A>admiring his valour and conduct, and thinking that he might prove a great 
<A NAME="260"></A>stay and support to him hereafter in his affairs, he sought means to attach 
<A NAME="261"></A>him to himself by some personal alliance, and his wife Metella joining 
<A NAME="262"></A>in his wishes, they two persuaded Pompey to put away Antistia, and marry 
<A NAME="263"></A>Aemilia, the step-daughter of Sylla, born by Metella to Scaurus, her former 
<A NAME="264"></A>husband, she being at that very time the wife of another man, living with 
<A NAME="265"></A>him, and with child by him. These were the very tyrannies of marriage, 
<A NAME="266"></A>and much more agreeable to the times under Sylla than to the nature and 
<A NAME="267"></A>habits of Pompey; that Aemilia great with child should be, as it were, 
<A NAME="268"></A>ravished from the embraces of another for him, and that Antistia should 
<A NAME="269"></A>be divorced with dishonour and misery by him, for whose sake she had been 
<A NAME="270"></A>but just before bereft of her father. For Antistius was murdered in the 
<A NAME="271"></A>senate, because he was suspected to be a favourer of Sylla for Pompey's 
<A NAME="272"></A>sake; and her mother, likewise, after she had seen all these indignities, 
<A NAME="273"></A>made away with herself, a new calamity to be added to the tragic accompaniments 
<A NAME="274"></A>of this marriage, and that there might be nothing wanting to complete them, 
<A NAME="275"></A>Aemilia herself died, almost immediately after entering Pompey's house, 
<A NAME="276"></A>in childbed.
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR>About this time news came to Sylla that Perpenna was fortifying 
<A NAME="278"></A>himself in Sicily, that the island was now become a refuge and receptacle 
<A NAME="279"></A>for the relics of the adverse party, that Carbo was hovering about those 
<A NAME="280"></A>seas with a navy, that Domitius had fallen in upon Africa, and that many 
<A NAME="281"></A>of the exiled men of note who had escaped from the proscriptions were daily 
<A NAME="282"></A>flocking into those parts. Against these, therefore, Pompey was sent with 
<A NAME="283"></A>a large force; and no sooner was he arrived in Sicily, but Perpenna immediately 
<A NAME="284"></A>departed, leaving the whole island to him. Pompey received the distressed 
<A NAME="285"></A>cities into favour, and treated all with great humanity, except the Mamertines 
<A NAME="286"></A>in Messena; for when they protested against his court and jurisdiction, 
<A NAME="287"></A>alleging their privilege and exemption founded upon an ancient charter 
<A NAME="288"></A>or grant of the Romans, he replied sharply, "What! will you never cease 
<A NAME="289"></A>prating of laws to us that have swords by our sides?" It was thought, likewise, 
<A NAME="290"></A>that he showed some inhumanity to Carbo, seeming rather to insult over 
<A NAME="291"></A>his misfortunes than to chastise his crimes. For if there had been a necessity, 
<A NAME="292"></A>as perhaps there was, that he should be taken off, that might have been 
<A NAME="293"></A>done at first, as soon as he was taken prisoner, for then it would have 
<A NAME="294"></A>been the act of him that commanded it. But here Pompey commanded a man 
<A NAME="295"></A>that had been thrice consul of Rome to be brought in fetters to stand at 
<A NAME="296"></A>the bar, he himself sitting upon the bench in judgment, examining the cause 
<A NAME="297"></A>with the formalities of law, to the offence and indignation of all that 
<A NAME="298"></A>were present, and afterwards ordered him to be taken away and put to death. 
<A NAME="299"></A>It is related, by the way, of Carbo, that as soon as he was brought to 
<A NAME="300"></A>the place, and saw the sword drawn for execution, he was suddenly seized 
<A NAME="301"></A>with a looseness or pain in his bowels, and desired a little respite of 
<A NAME="302"></A>the executioner, and a convenient place to relieve himself. And yet further, 
<A NAME="303"></A>Caius Oppius, the friend of Caesar, tells us, that Pompey dealt cruelly 
<A NAME="304"></A>with Quintus Valerius, a man of singular learning and science. For when 
<A NAME="305"></A>he was brought to him, he walked aside, and drew him into conversation, 
<A NAME="306"></A>and after putting a variety of questions to him, and receiving answers 
<A NAME="307"></A>from him, he ordered his officers to take him away and put him to death. 
<A NAME="308"></A>But we must not be too credulous in the case of narratives told by Oppius, 
<A NAME="309"></A>especially when he undertakes to relate anything touching the friends or 
<A NAME="310"></A>foes of Caesar. This is certain, that there lay a necessity upon Pompey 
<A NAME="311"></A>to be severe upon many of Sylla's enemies, those at least that were eminent 
<A NAME="312"></A>persons in themselves, and notoriously known to be taken; but for the rest, 
<A NAME="313"></A>he acted with all the clemency possible for him, conniving at the concealment 
<A NAME="314"></A>of some, and himself being the instrument in the escape of others. So in 
<A NAME="315"></A>the case of the Himeraeans; for when Pompey had determined on severely 
<A NAME="316"></A>punishing their city, as they had been abettors of the enemy, Sthenis, 
<A NAME="317"></A>the leader of the people there, craving liberty of speech, told him that 
<A NAME="318"></A>what he was about to do was not at all consistent with justice, for that 
<A NAME="319"></A>he would pass by the guilty and destroy the innocent; and on Pompey demanding 
<A NAME="320"></A>who that guilty person was that would assume the offences of them all, 
<A NAME="321"></A>Sthenis replied it was himself, who had engaged his friends by persuasion 
<A NAME="322"></A>to what they had done, and his enemies by force; whereupon Pompey, being 
<A NAME="323"></A>much taken with the frank speech and noble spirit of the man, first forgave 
<A NAME="324"></A>his crime, and then pardoned all the rest of the Himeraeans. Hearing, likewise, 
<A NAME="325"></A>that his soldiers were very disorderly in their march, doing violence upon 
<A NAME="326"></A>the roads, he ordered their swords to be sealed up in their scabbards, 
<A NAME="327"></A>and whosoever kept them not so were severely punished.
<A NAME="328"></A><BR><BR>Whilst Pompey was thus busy in the affairs and government of Sicily, 
<A NAME="329"></A>he received a decree of the senate, and a commission from Sylla, commanding 
<A NAME="330"></A>him forthwith to sail into Africa, and make war upon Domitius with all 
<A NAME="331"></A>his forces: for Domitius had rallied up a far greater army than Marius 
<A NAME="332"></A>had had not long since, when he sailed out of Africa into Italy, and caused 
<A NAME="333"></A>a revolution in Rome, and himself, of a fugitive outlaw, became a tyrant. 
<A NAME="334"></A>Pompey, therefore, having prepared everything with the utmost speed, left 
<A NAME="335"></A>Memmius, his sister's husband, governor of Sicily, and set sail with one 
<A NAME="336"></A>hundred and twenty galleys, and eight hundred other vessels laden with 
<A NAME="337"></A>provisions, money, ammunition, and engines of battery. He arrived with 
<A NAME="338"></A>his fleet, part at the port of Utica, part at Carthage; and no sooner was 
<A NAME="339"></A>he landed, but seven thousand of the enemy revolted and came over to him, 
<A NAME="340"></A>while his own forces that he brought with him consisted of six entire legions. 
<A NAME="341"></A>Here they tell us of a pleasant incident that happened to him at his first 
<A NAME="342"></A>arrival.
<A NAME="343"></A><BR><BR>Some of his soldiers having by accident stumbled upon a treasure, 
<A NAME="344"></A>by which they got a good sum of money, the rest of the army hearing this, 
<A NAME="345"></A>began to fancy that the field was full of gold and silver, which had been 
<A NAME="346"></A>hid there of old by the Carthaginians in the time of their calamities, 
<A NAME="347"></A>and thereupon fell to work, so that the army was useless to Pompey for 
<A NAME="348"></A>many days, being totally engaged in digging for the fancied treasure, he 
<A NAME="349"></A>himself all the while walking up and down only, and laughing to see so 
<A NAME="350"></A>many thousands together, digging and turning up the earth. Until at last, 
<A NAME="351"></A>growing weary and hopeless, they came to themselves and returned to their 
<A NAME="352"></A>general, begging him to lead them where he pleased, for that they had already 
<A NAME="353"></A>received the punishment of their folly.
<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR>By this time Domitius had prepared himself and drawn out his army 
<A NAME="355"></A>in array against Pompey; but there was a watercourse betwixt them, craggy, 
<A NAME="356"></A>and difficult to pass over; and this, together with a great storm of wind 
<A NAME="357"></A>and rain pouring down even from break of day, seemed to leave but little 
<A NAME="358"></A>possibility of their coming together; so that Domitius, not expecting any 
<A NAME="359"></A>engagement that day, commanded his forces to draw off and retire to the 
<A NAME="360"></A>camp. Now Pompey, who was watchful upon every occasion, making use of the 
<A NAME="361"></A>opportunity, ordered a march forthwith, and having passed over the torrent, 
<A NAME="362"></A>fell in immediately upon their quarters. The enemy was in great disorder 
<A NAME="363"></A>and tumult, and in that confusion attempted a resistance; but they neither 
<A NAME="364"></A>were all there, nor supported one another; besides, the wind having veered 
<A NAME="365"></A>about beat the rain full in their faces. Neither indeed was the storm less 
<A NAME="366"></A>troublesome to the Romans, for that they could not clearly discern one 
<A NAME="367"></A>another, insomuch that even Pompey himself, being unknown, escaped narrowly; 
<A NAME="368"></A>for when one of his soldiers demanded of him the word of battle, it happened 
<A NAME="369"></A>that he was somewhat slow in his answer, which might have cost him his 
<A NAME="370"></A>life.
<A NAME="371"></A><BR><BR>The enemy being routed with a great slaughter (for it is said that 
<A NAME="372"></A>of twenty thousand there escaped but three thousand), the army saluted 
<A NAME="373"></A>Pompey by the name of Imperator; but he declined if, telling them that 
<A NAME="374"></A>he could not by any means accept of that title as long as he saw the camp 
<A NAME="375"></A>of the enemy standing; but if they designed to make him worthy of the honour, 
<A NAME="376"></A>they must first demolish that. The soldiers on hearing this went at once 
<A NAME="377"></A>and made an assault upon the works and trenches, and there Pompey fought 
<A NAME="378"></A>without his helmet, in memory of his former danger, and to avoid the like. 
<A NAME="379"></A>The camp was thus taken by storm, and among the rest Domitius was slain. 
<A NAME="380"></A>After that overthrow, the cities of the country thereabouts were all either 
<A NAME="381"></A>secured by surrender, or taken by storm. King Iarbas, likewise, a confederate 
<A NAME="382"></A>and auxiliary of Domitius, was taken prisoner, and his kingdom was given 
<A NAME="383"></A>to Hiempsal.
<A NAME="384"></A><BR><BR>Pompey could not rest here, but being ambitious to follow the good 
<A NAME="385"></A>fortune and use the valour of his army, entered Numidia; and marching forward 
<A NAME="386"></A>many days' journey up into the country, he conquered all where-ever he 
<A NAME="387"></A>came. And having revived the terror of the Roman power, which was now almost 
<A NAME="388"></A>obliterated among the barbarous nations, he said likewise, that the wild 
<A NAME="389"></A>beasts of Africa ought not to be left without some experience of the courage 
<A NAME="390"></A>and success of the Romans, and therefore he bestowed some few days in hunting 
<A NAME="391"></A>lions and elephants. And it is said that it was not above the space of 
<A NAME="392"></A>forty days at the utmost in which he gave a total overthrow to the enemy, 
<A NAME="393"></A>reduced Africa, and established the affairs of the kings and kingdoms of 
<A NAME="394"></A>all that country, being then in the twenty-fourth year of his 
<A NAME="395"></A>age.
<A NAME="396"></A><BR><BR>When Pompey returned back to the city of Utica, there were presented 
<A NAME="397"></A>to him letters and orders from Sylla, commanding him to disband the rest 
<A NAME="398"></A>of his army, and himself with one legion only to wait there the coming 
<A NAME="399"></A>of another general, to succeed him in the government. This, inwardly, was 
<A NAME="400"></A>extremely grievous to Pompey, though he made no show of it. But the army 
<A NAME="401"></A>resented it openly, and when Pompey besought them to depart and go home 
<A NAME="402"></A>before him, they began to revile Sylla, and declared broadly that they 
<A NAME="403"></A>were resolved not to forsake him, neither did they think it safe for him 
<A NAME="404"></A>to trust the tyrant. Pompey at first endeavoured to appease and pacify 
<A NAME="405"></A>them by fair speeches; but when he saw that his persuasions were vain, 
<A NAME="406"></A>he left the bench, and retired to his tent with tears in his eyes. But 
<A NAME="407"></A>the soldiers followed him, and seizing upon him, by force brought him again, 
<A NAME="408"></A>and placed him in his tribunal; where great part of that day was spent 
<A NAME="409"></A>in dispute, they on their part persuading him to stay and command them, 
<A NAME="410"></A>he, on the other side, pressing upon them obedience and the danger of mutiny. 
<A NAME="411"></A>At last, when they grew yet more importunate and clamorous, he swore that 
<A NAME="412"></A>he would kill himself if they attempted to force him; and scarcely even 
<A NAME="413"></A>thus appeased them. Nevertheless, the first tidings brought to Sylla were 
<A NAME="414"></A>that Pompey was up in rebellion; on which he remarked to some of his friends, 
<A NAME="415"></A>"I see, then, it is my destiny to contend with children in my old age;" 
<A NAME="416"></A>alluding at the same time to Marius, who, being but a mere youth, had given 
<A NAME="417"></A>him great trouble, and brought him into extreme danger. But being undeceived 
<A NAME="418"></A>afterwards by better intelligence, and finding the whole city prepared 
<A NAME="419"></A>to meet Pompey, and receive him with every display of kindness and honour, 
<A NAME="420"></A>he resolved to exceed them all. And, therefore, going out foremost to meet 
<A NAME="421"></A>him and embracing him with great cordiality, he gave him his welcome aloud 
<A NAME="422"></A>in the title of Magnus, or the Great, and bade all that were present call 
<A NAME="423"></A>him by that name. Others say that he had this title first given him by 
<A NAME="424"></A>a general acclamation of all the army in Africa, but that it was fixed 
<A NAME="425"></A>upon him by this ratification of Sylla. It is certain that he himself was 
<A NAME="426"></A>the last that owned the title; for it was a long time after, when he was 
<A NAME="427"></A>sent proconsul into Spain against Sertorius, that he began to write himself 
<A NAME="428"></A>in his letters and commissions by the name of Pompeius Magnus; common and 
<A NAME="429"></A>familiar use having then worn off the invidiousness of the title. And one 
<A NAME="430"></A>cannot but accord respect and admiration to the ancient Romans, who did 
<A NAME="431"></A>not reward the successes of action and conduct in war alone with such honourable 
<A NAME="432"></A>titles, but adorned likewise the virtue and services of eminent men in 
<A NAME="433"></A>civil government with the same distinctions and marks of honour. Two persons 
<A NAME="434"></A>received from the people the name of Maximus, or the Greatest, Valerius 
<A NAME="435"></A>for reconciling the senate and people, and Fabius Rullus, because he put 
<A NAME="436"></A>out of the senate certain sons of freed slaves who had been admitted into 
<A NAME="437"></A>it because of their wealth.
<A NAME="438"></A><BR><BR>Pompey now desired the honour of a triumph, which Sylla opposed, 
<A NAME="439"></A>alleging that the law allowed that honour to none but consuls and praetors, 
<A NAME="440"></A>and therefore Scipio the elder, who subdued the Carthaginians in Spain 
<A NAME="441"></A>in far greater and nobler conflicts, never petitioned for a triumph, because 
<A NAME="442"></A>he had never been consul or praetor; and if Pompey, who had scarcely yet 
<A NAME="443"></A>fully grown a beard, and was not of age to be a senator, should enter the 
<A NAME="444"></A>city in triumph, what a weight of envy would it bring, he said, at once 
<A NAME="445"></A>upon his government and Pompey's honour. This was his language to Pompey, 
<A NAME="446"></A>intimating that he could not by any means yield to his request, but if 
<A NAME="447"></A>he would persist in his ambition, that he was resolved to interpose his 
<A NAME="448"></A>power to humble him. Pompey, however, was not daunted; but bade Sylla recollect 
<A NAME="449"></A>that more worshipped the rising than the setting sun; as if to tell him 
<A NAME="450"></A>that his power was increasing and Sylla's in the wane. Sylla did not perfectly 
<A NAME="451"></A>hear the words, but observing a sort of amazement and wonder in the looks 
<A NAME="452"></A>and gestures of those that did hear them, he asked what it was that he 
<A NAME="453"></A>said. When it was told him, he seemed astounded at Pompey's boldness, and 
<A NAME="454"></A>cried out twice together, "Let him triumph," and when others began to show 
<A NAME="455"></A>their disapprobation and offence at it, Pompey, it is said, to gall and 
<A NAME="456"></A>vex them the more, designed to have his triumphant chariot drawn with four 
<A NAME="457"></A>elephants (having brought over several which belonged to the African kings), 
<A NAME="458"></A>but the gates of the city being too narrow, he was forced to desist from 
<A NAME="459"></A>that project, and be content with horses. And when his soldiers, who had 
<A NAME="460"></A>not received as large rewards as they had expected, began to clamour, and 
<A NAME="461"></A>interrupt the triumph, Pompey regarded these as little as the rest, and 
<A NAME="462"></A>plainly told them that he had rather lose the honour of his triumph than 
<A NAME="463"></A>flatter them. Upon which Servilius, a man of great distinction, and at 
<A NAME="464"></A>first one of the chief opposers of Pompey's triumph, said, he now perceived 
<A NAME="465"></A>that Pompey was truly great and worthy of a triumph. It is clear that he 
<A NAME="466"></A>might easily have been a senator, also, if he had wished, but he did not 
<A NAME="467"></A>sue for that, being ambitious, it seems, only of unusual honours. For what 
<A NAME="468"></A>wonder had it been for Pompey to sit in the senate before his time? But 
<A NAME="469"></A>to triumph before he was in the senate was really an excess of 
<A NAME="470"></A>glory.
<A NAME="471"></A><BR><BR>And, moreover, it did not a little ingratiate him with the people, 
<A NAME="472"></A>who were much pleased to see him after his triumph take his place again 
<A NAME="473"></A>among the Roman knights. On the other side, it was no less distasteful 
<A NAME="474"></A>to Sylla to see how fast he came on, and to what a height of glory and 
<A NAME="475"></A>power he was advancing; yet being ashamed to hinder him, he kept quiet. 
<A NAME="476"></A>But when, against his direct wishes, Pompey got Lepidus made consul, having 
<A NAME="477"></A>openly joined in the canvass and, by the good-will the people felt for 
<A NAME="478"></A>himself, conciliated their favour for Lepidus, Sylla could forbear no longer; 
<A NAME="479"></A>but when he saw him coming away from the election through the forum with 
<A NAME="480"></A>a great train after him, cried out to him, "Well, young man, I see you 
<A NAME="481"></A>rejoice in your victory. And, indeed, is it not a most generous and worthy 
<A NAME="482"></A>act, that the consulship should be given to Lepidus, the vilest of men, 
<A NAME="483"></A>in preference to Catulus, the best and most deserving in the city, and 
<A NAME="484"></A>all by your influence with the people? It will be well, however, for you 
<A NAME="485"></A>to be wakeful and look to your interests; as you have been making your 
<A NAME="486"></A>enemy stronger than yourself." But that which gave the clearest demonstration 
<A NAME="487"></A>of Sylla's ill-will to Pompey was his last will and testament; for whereas 
<A NAME="488"></A>he bequeathed several legacies to all the rest of his friends, and appointed 
<A NAME="489"></A>some of them guardians to his son, he passed by Pompey without the least 
<A NAME="490"></A>remembrance. However, Pompey bore this with great moderation and temper; 
<A NAME="491"></A>and when Lepidus and others were disposed to obstruct his interment in 
<A NAME="492"></A>the Campus Martius, and to prevent any public funeral taking place, came 
<A NAME="493"></A>forward in support of it, and saw his obsequies performed with all honour 
<A NAME="494"></A>and security.
<A NAME="495"></A><BR><BR>Shortly after the death of Sylla, his prophetic words were fulfilled; 
<A NAME="496"></A>and Lepidus proposing to be the successor to all his power and authority, 
<A NAME="497"></A>without any ambiguities or pretences, immediately appeared in arms, rousing 
<A NAME="498"></A>once more and gathering about him all the long dangerous remains of the 
<A NAME="499"></A>old factions, which had escaped the hand of Sylla. Catulus, his colleague, 
<A NAME="500"></A>who was followed by the sounder part of the senate and people, was a man 
<A NAME="501"></A>of the greatest esteem among the Romans for wisdom and justice; but his 
<A NAME="502"></A>talent lay in the government of the city rather than the camp, whereas 
<A NAME="503"></A>the exigency required the skill of Pompey. Pompey, therefore, was not long 
<A NAME="504"></A>in suspense which way to dispose of himself, but joining with the nobility, 
<A NAME="505"></A>was presently appointed general of the army against Lepidus, who had already 
<A NAME="506"></A>raised up war in great part of Italy, and held Cisalpine Gaul in subjection 
<A NAME="507"></A>with an army under Brutus. As for the rest of his garrisons, Pompey subdued 
<A NAME="508"></A>them with ease in his march, but Mutina in Gaul resisted in a formal siege, 
<A NAME="509"></A>and he lay here a long time encamped against Brutus. In the meantime Lepidus 
<A NAME="510"></A>marched in all haste against Rome, and sitting down before it with a crowd 
<A NAME="511"></A>of followers, to the terror of those within, demanded a second consulship. 
<A NAME="512"></A>But that fear quickly vanished upon letters sent from Pompey, announcing 
<A NAME="513"></A>that he had ended the war without a battle; for Brutus, either betraying 
<A NAME="514"></A>his army, or being betrayed by their revolt, surrendered himself to Pompey, 
<A NAME="515"></A>and receiving a guard of horse, was conducted to a little town upon the 
<A NAME="516"></A>river Po, where he was slain the next day by Geminius, in execution of 
<A NAME="517"></A>Pompey's commands. And for this Pompey was much censured; for, having at 
<A NAME="518"></A>the beginning of the revolt written to the senate that Brutus had voluntarily 
<A NAME="519"></A>surrendered himself, immediately afterward he sent other letters, with 
<A NAME="520"></A>matter of accusation against the man after he was taken off. Brutus, who, 
<A NAME="521"></A>with Cassius, slew Caesar, was son to this Brutus; neither in war nor in 
<A NAME="522"></A>his death like his father, as appears at large in his life. Lepidus, upon 
<A NAME="523"></A>this being driven out of Italy, fled to Sardinia, where he fell sick and 
<A NAME="524"></A>died of sorrow, not for his public misfortunes, as they say, but upon the 
<A NAME="525"></A>discovery of a letter proving his wife to have been unfaithful to 
<A NAME="526"></A>him.
<A NAME="527"></A><BR><BR>There yet remained Sertorius, a very different general from Lepidus, 
<A NAME="528"></A>in possession of Spain, and making himself formidable to Rome; the final 
<A NAME="529"></A>disease, as it were, in which the scattered evils of the civil wars had 
<A NAME="530"></A>now collected. He had already cut off various inferior commanders, and 
<A NAME="531"></A>was at this time coping with Metellus Pius, a man of repute and a good 
<A NAME="532"></A>soldier, though perhaps he might now seem too slow, by reason of his age, 
<A NAME="533"></A>to second and improve the happier moments of war, and might be sometimes 
<A NAME="534"></A>wanting to those advantages which Sertorius, by his quickness and dexterity, 
<A NAME="535"></A>would wrest out of his hands. For Sertorius was always hovering about, 
<A NAME="536"></A>and coming upon him unawares, like a captain of thieves rather than soldiers, 
<A NAME="537"></A>disturbing him perpetually with ambuscades and light skirmishes; whereas 
<A NAME="538"></A>Metellus was accustomed to regular conduct, and fighting in battle array 
<A NAME="539"></A>with full-armed soldiers. Pompey, therefore, keeping his army in readiness, 
<A NAME="540"></A>made it his object to be sent in aid to Metellus; neither would he be induced 
<A NAME="541"></A>to disband his forces, notwithstanding that Catulus called upon him to 
<A NAME="542"></A>do so, but by some colourable device or other he still kept them in arms 
<A NAME="543"></A>about the city, until the senate at last thought fit, upon the report of 
<A NAME="544"></A>Lucius Philippus, to decree him that government. At that time, they say, 
<A NAME="545"></A>one of the senators there expressing his wonder and demanding of Philippus 
<A NAME="546"></A>whether his meaning was that Pompey should be sent into Spain as proconsul, 
<A NAME="547"></A>"No," replied Philippus, "but as proconsuls," as if both consuls for that 
<A NAME="548"></A>year were in his opinion wholly useless.
<A NAME="549"></A><BR><BR>When Pompey was arrived in Spain, as is usual upon the fame of 
<A NAME="550"></A>a new leader, men began to be inspired with new hopes, and those nations 
<A NAME="551"></A>that had not entered into a very strict alliance with Sertorius began to 
<A NAME="552"></A>waver and revolt; whereupon Sertorius uttered various arrogant and scornful 
<A NAME="553"></A>speeches against Pompey, saying, in derision, that he should want no other 
<A NAME="554"></A>weapon but a ferula and rod to chastise this boy with, if he were not afraid 
<A NAME="555"></A>of that old woman, meaning Metellus. Yet in deed and reality he stood in 
<A NAME="556"></A>awe of Pompey, and kept on his guard against him, as appeared by his whole 
<A NAME="557"></A>management of the war, which he was observed to conduct much more warily 
<A NAME="558"></A>than before: for Metellus, which one would not have imagined, was grown 
<A NAME="559"></A>excessively luxurious in his habits, having given himself over to self-indulgence 
<A NAME="560"></A>and pleasure, and from a moderate and temperate became suddenly a sumptuous 
<A NAME="561"></A>and ostentatious liver, so that this very thing gained Pompey great reputation 
<A NAME="562"></A>and good-will, as he made himself somewhat specially an example of frugality, 
<A NAME="563"></A>although that virtue was habitual in him, and required no great industry 
<A NAME="564"></A>to exercise it, as he was naturally inclined to temperance, and no ways 
<A NAME="565"></A>inordinate in his desires. The fortune of the war was very various; nothing, 
<A NAME="566"></A>however, annoyed Pompey so much as the taking of the town of Lauron by 
<A NAME="567"></A>Sertorius. For when Pompey thought he had him safe enclosed, and had boasted 
<A NAME="568"></A>somewhat largely of raising the siege, he found himself all of a sudden 
<A NAME="569"></A>encompassed; insomuch that he durst not move out of his camp; but was forced 
<A NAME="570"></A>to sit still whilst the city was taken and burnt before his face. However, 
<A NAME="571"></A>afterwards, in a battle near Valentia, he gave a great defeat to Herennius 
<A NAME="572"></A>and Perpenna, two commanders among the refugees who had fled to Sertorius, 
<A NAME="573"></A>and now lieutenants under him, in which he slew above ten thousand 
<A NAME="574"></A>men.
<A NAME="575"></A><BR><BR>Pompey, being elated and filled with confidence by this victory, 
<A NAME="576"></A>made all haste to engage Sertorius himself, and the rather lest Metellus 
<A NAME="577"></A>should come in for a share in the honour of the victory. Late in the day 
<A NAME="578"></A>towards sunset they joined battle near the river Sucro, both being in fear 
<A NAME="579"></A>lest Metellus should come: Pompey, that he might engage alone, Sertorius, 
<A NAME="580"></A>that he might have one alone to engage with. The issue of the battle proved 
<A NAME="581"></A>doubtful, for a wing of each side had the better, but of the generals Sertorius 
<A NAME="582"></A>had the greater honour, for that he maintained his post, having put to 
<A NAME="583"></A>flight the entire division that was opposed to him, whereas Pompey was 
<A NAME="584"></A>himself almost made a prisoner; for being set upon by a strong man-at-arms 
<A NAME="585"></A>that fought on foot (he being on horseback), as they were closely engaged 
<A NAME="586"></A>hand to hand the strokes of their swords chanced to light upon their hands, 
<A NAME="587"></A>but with a different success; for Pompey's was a slight wound only, whereas 
<A NAME="588"></A>he cut off the other's hand. However, it happened so, that many now falling 
<A NAME="589"></A>upon Pompey together, and his own forces there being put to the rout, he 
<A NAME="590"></A>made his escape beyond expectation, by quitting his horse, and turning 
<A NAME="591"></A>him out among the enemy. For the horse being richly adorned with golden 
<A NAME="592"></A>trappings, and having a caparison of great value, the soldiers quarrelled 
<A NAME="593"></A>among themselves for the booty, so that while they were fighting with one 
<A NAME="594"></A>another, and dividing the spoil, Pompey made his escape. By break of day 
<A NAME="595"></A>the next morning each drew out his forces into the field to claim the victory; 
<A NAME="596"></A>but Metellus coming up, Sertorius vanished, having broken up and dispersed 
<A NAME="597"></A>his army. For this was the way in which he used to raise and disband his 
<A NAME="598"></A>armies, so that sometimes he would be wandering up and down all alone, 
<A NAME="599"></A>and at other times again he would come pouring into the field at the head 
<A NAME="600"></A>of no less than one hundred and fifty thousand fighting men, swelling of 
<A NAME="601"></A>a sudden like a winter torrent.
<A NAME="602"></A><BR><BR>When Pompey was going, after the battle, to meet and welcome Metellus, 
<A NAME="603"></A>and when they were near one another, he commanded his attendants to lower 
<A NAME="604"></A>their rods in honour of Metellus, as his senior and superior. But Metellus 
<A NAME="605"></A>on the other side forbade it, and behaved himself in general very obligingly 
<A NAME="606"></A>to him, not claiming any prerogative either in respect of his consular 
<A NAME="607"></A>rank or seniority; excepting only that when they encamped together, the 
<A NAME="608"></A>watchword was given to the whole camp by Metellus. But generally they had 
<A NAME="609"></A>their camps asunder, being divided and distracted by the enemy, who took 
<A NAME="610"></A>all shapes, and being always in motion, would by some skilful artifice 
<A NAME="611"></A>appear in a variety of places almost in the same instant, drawing them 
<A NAME="612"></A>from one attack to another, and at last keeping them from foraging, wasting 
<A NAME="613"></A>the country, and holding the dominion of the sea, Sertorius drove them 
<A NAME="614"></A>both out of that part of Spain which was under his control, and forced 
<A NAME="615"></A>them, for want of necessaries, to retreat into provinces that did not belong 
<A NAME="616"></A>to them.
<A NAME="617"></A><BR><BR>Pompey, having made use of and expended the greatest part of his 
<A NAME="618"></A>own private revenues upon the war, sent and demanded moneys of the senate, 
<A NAME="619"></A>adding that, in case they did not furnish him speedily, he should be forced 
<A NAME="620"></A>to return into Italy with his army. Lucullus being consul at that time, 
<A NAME="621"></A>though at variance with Pompey, yet in consideration that he himself was 
<A NAME="622"></A>a candidate for the command against Mithridates, procured and hastened 
<A NAME="623"></A>these supplies, fearing lest there should be any pretence or occasion given 
<A NAME="624"></A>to Pompey of returning home, who of himself was no less desirous of leaving 
<A NAME="625"></A>Sertorius and of undertaking the war against Mithridates, as an enterprise 
<A NAME="626"></A>which by all appearance would prove much more honourable and not so dangerous. 
<A NAME="627"></A>In the meantime Sertorius died, being treacherously murdered by some of 
<A NAME="628"></A>his own party; and Perpenna, the chief among them, took the command and 
<A NAME="629"></A>attempted to carry on the same enterprises with Sertorius, having indeed 
<A NAME="630"></A>the same forces and the same means, only wanting the same skill and conduct 
<A NAME="631"></A>in the use of them. Pompey therefore marched directly against Perpenna, 
<A NAME="632"></A>and finding him acting merely at random in his affairs, had a decoy ready 
<A NAME="633"></A>for him, and sent out a detachment of ten cohorts into the level country 
<A NAME="634"></A>with orders to range up and down and disperse themselves abroad. The bait 
<A NAME="635"></A>took accordingly, and no sooner had Perpenna turned upon the prey and had 
<A NAME="636"></A>them in chase, but Pompey appeared suddenly with all his army, and joining 
<A NAME="637"></A>battle, gave him a total overthrow. Most of his officers were slain in 
<A NAME="638"></A>the field, and he himself being brought prisoner to Pompey, was by his 
<A NAME="639"></A>order put to death. Neither was Pompey guilty in this of ingratitude or 
<A NAME="640"></A>unmindfulness of what had occurred in Sicily, which some have laid to his 
<A NAME="641"></A>charge, but was guided by a high-minded policy and a deliberate counsel 
<A NAME="642"></A>for the security of his country. For Perpenna, having in his custody all 
<A NAME="643"></A>Sertorius's papers, offered to produce several letters from the greatest 
<A NAME="644"></A>men in Rome, who, desirous of a change and subversion of the government, 
<A NAME="645"></A>had invited Sertorius into Italy. And Pompey, fearing that these might 
<A NAME="646"></A>be the occasion of worse wars than those which were now ended, thought 
<A NAME="647"></A>it advisable to put Perpenna to death, and burnt the letters without reading 
<A NAME="648"></A>them.
<A NAME="649"></A><BR><BR>Pompey continued in Spain after this so long a time as was necessary 
<A NAME="650"></A>for the suppression of all the greatest disorders in the province; and 
<A NAME="651"></A>after moderating and allaying the more violent heats of affairs there, 
<A NAME="652"></A>returned with his army into Italy, where he arrived, as chance would have 
<A NAME="653"></A>it, in the height of the servile war. Accordingly, upon his arrival, Crassus, 
<A NAME="654"></A>the commander in that war, at some hazard, precipitated a battle, in which 
<A NAME="655"></A>he had great success, and slew upon the place twelve thousand three hundred 
<A NAME="656"></A>of the insurgents. Nor yet was he so quick, but that fortune reserved to 
<A NAME="657"></A>Pompey some share of honour in the success of this war, for five thousand 
<A NAME="658"></A>of those that had escaped out of the battle fell into his hands; and when 
<A NAME="659"></A>he had totally cut them off, he wrote to the senate, that Crassus had overthrown 
<A NAME="660"></A>the slaves in battle, but that he had plucked up the whole war by the roots. 
<A NAME="661"></A>And it was agreeable in Rome both thus to say, and thus to hear said, because 
<A NAME="662"></A>of the general favour of Pompey. But of the Spanish war and the conquest 
<A NAME="663"></A>of Sertorius, no one, even in jest, could have ascribed the honour to any 
<A NAME="664"></A>one else. Nevertheless, all this high respect for him, and this desire 
<A NAME="665"></A>to see him come home, were not unmixed with apprehensions and suspicions 
<A NAME="666"></A>that he might perhaps not disband his army, but take his way by force of 
<A NAME="667"></A>arms and a supreme command to the seat of Sylla. And so in the number of 
<A NAME="668"></A>all those that ran out to meet him and congratulate his return, as many 
<A NAME="669"></A>went out of fear as affection. But after Pompey had removed this alarm, 
<A NAME="670"></A>by declaring beforehand that he would discharge the army after his triumph, 
<A NAME="671"></A>those that envied him could now only complain that he affected popularity, 
<A NAME="672"></A>courting the common people more than the nobility, and that whereas Sylla 
<A NAME="673"></A>had abolished the tribuneship of the people, he designed to gratify the 
<A NAME="674"></A>people by restoring that office, which was indeed the fact. For there was 
<A NAME="675"></A>not any one thing that the people of Rome were more wildly eager for, or 
<A NAME="676"></A>more passionately desired, than the restoration of that office, insomuch 
<A NAME="677"></A>that Pompey thought himself extremely fortunate in this opportunity, despairing 
<A NAME="678"></A>(if he were anticipated by some one else in this) of ever meeting with 
<A NAME="679"></A>any other sufficient means of expressing his gratitude for the favours 
<A NAME="680"></A>which he had received from the people.
<A NAME="681"></A><BR><BR>Though a second triumph was decreed him, and he was declared consul, 
<A NAME="682"></A>yet all these honours did not seem so great an evidence of his power and 
<A NAME="683"></A>glory as the ascendant which he had over Crassus; for he, the wealthiest 
<A NAME="684"></A>among all the statesmen of his time, and the most eloquent and greatest 
<A NAME="685"></A>too, who had looked down on Pompey himself and on all others beneath him, 
<A NAME="686"></A>durst not appear a candidate for the consulship before he had applied to 
<A NAME="687"></A>Pompey. The request was made accordingly, and was eagerly embraced by Pompey, 
<A NAME="688"></A>who had long sought an occasion to oblige him in some friendly office; 
<A NAME="689"></A>so that he solicited for Crassus, and entreated the people heartily, declaring 
<A NAME="690"></A>that their favour would be no less to him in choosing Crassus his colleague, 
<A NAME="691"></A>than in making himself consul. Yet for all this, when they were created 
<A NAME="692"></A>consuls, they were always at variance, and opposing one another. Crassus 
<A NAME="693"></A>prevailed most in the senate, and Pompey's power was no less with the people, 
<A NAME="694"></A>he having restored to them the office of tribune, and having allowed the 
<A NAME="695"></A>courts of judicature to be transferred back to the knights by a new law. 
<A NAME="696"></A>He himself in person, too, afforded them a most grateful spectacle, when 
<A NAME="697"></A>he appeared and craved his discharge from the military service. For it 
<A NAME="698"></A>is an ancient custom among the Romans that the knights, when they had served 
<A NAME="699"></A>out their legal time in the wars, should lead their horses into the market-place 
<A NAME="700"></A>before the two officers, called censors, and having given an account of 
<A NAME="701"></A>the commanders and generals under whom they served, as also of the places 
<A NAME="702"></A>and actions of their service, should be discharged, every man with honour 
<A NAME="703"></A>or disgrace, according to his deserts. There were then sitting in state 
<A NAME="704"></A>upon the bench two censors, Gellius and Lentulus, inspecting the knights, 
<A NAME="705"></A>who were passing by in muster before them, when Pompey was seen coming 
<A NAME="706"></A>down into the forum, with all the ensigns of a consul, but leading his 
<A NAME="707"></A>horse in his hand. When he came up, he bade his lictors make way for him, 
<A NAME="708"></A>and so he led his horse to the bench; the people being all this while in 
<A NAME="709"></A>a sort of amaze, and all in silence, and the censors themselves regarding 
<A NAME="710"></A>the sight with a mixture of respect and gratification. Then the senior 
<A NAME="711"></A>censor examined him: "Pompeius Magnus, I demand of you whether you have 
<A NAME="712"></A>served the full time in the wars that is prescribed by the law?" "Yes," 
<A NAME="713"></A>replied Pompey, with a loud voice, "I have served all, and all under myself 
<A NAME="714"></A>as general." The people hearing this gave a great shout, and made such 
<A NAME="715"></A>an outcry for delight, that there was no appeasing it; and the censors 
<A NAME="716"></A>rising from their judgment seat accompanied him home to gratify the multitude 
<A NAME="717"></A>who followed after, clapping their hands and shouting.
<A NAME="718"></A><BR><BR>Pompey's consulship was now expiring, and yet his difference with 
<A NAME="719"></A>Crassus increasing, when one Caius Aurelius, a knight, a man who had declined 
<A NAME="720"></A>public business all his lifetime, mounted the hustings, and addressed himself 
<A NAME="721"></A>in an oration to the assembly, declaring that Jupiter had appeared to him 
<A NAME="722"></A>in a dream, commanding him to tell the consuls that they should not give 
<A NAME="723"></A>up office until they were friends. After this was said, Pompey stood silent, 
<A NAME="724"></A>but Crassus took him by the hand, and spoke in this manner: "I do not think, 
<A NAME="725"></A>fellow-citizens, that I shall do anything mean or dishonourable in yielding 
<A NAME="726"></A>first to Pompey, whom you were pleased to ennoble with the title of Great, 
<A NAME="727"></A>when as yet he scarce had a hair on his face; and granted the honour of 
<A NAME="728"></A>two triumphs before he had a place in the senate." Hereupon they were reconciled 
<A NAME="729"></A>and laid down their office. Crassus resumed the manner of life which he 
<A NAME="730"></A>had always pursued before; but Pompey in the great generality of causes 
<A NAME="731"></A>for judgment declined appearing on either side, and by degrees withdrew 
<A NAME="732"></A>himself totally from the forum, showing himself but seldom in public; and, 
<A NAME="733"></A>whenever he did, it was with a great train after him. Neither was it easy 
<A NAME="734"></A>to meet or visit him without a crowd of people about him; he was most pleased 
<A NAME="735"></A>to make his appearance before large numbers at once, as though he wished 
<A NAME="736"></A>to maintain in this way his state and majesty, and as if he held himself 
<A NAME="737"></A>bound to preserve his dignity from contact with the addresses and conversation 
<A NAME="738"></A>of common people. And life in the robe of peace is only too apt to lower 
<A NAME="739"></A>the reputation of men that have grown great by arms, who naturally find 
<A NAME="740"></A>difficulty in adapting themselves to the habits of civil equality. They 
<A NAME="741"></A>expect to be treated as the first in the city, even as they were in the 
<A NAME="742"></A>camp; and on the other hand, men who in war were nobody, think it intolerable 
<A NAME="743"></A>if in the city at any rate they are not to take the lead. And so when a 
<A NAME="744"></A>warrior renowned for victories and triumphs shall turn advocate and appear 
<A NAME="745"></A>among them in the forum, they endeavour their utmost to obscure and depress 
<A NAME="746"></A>him; whereas, if he gives up any pretensions here and retires, they will 
<A NAME="747"></A>maintain his military honour and authority beyond the reach of envy. Events 
<A NAME="748"></A>themselves not long after showed the truth of this.
<A NAME="749"></A><BR><BR>The power of the pirates first commenced in Cilicia, having in 
<A NAME="750"></A>truth but a precarious and obscure beginning, but gained life and boldness 
<A NAME="751"></A>afterwards in the wars of Mithridates, where they hired themselves out 
<A NAME="752"></A>and took employment in the king's service. Afterwards, whilst the Romans 
<A NAME="753"></A>were embroiled in their civil wars, being engaged against one another even 
<A NAME="754"></A>before the very gates of Rome, the seas lay waste and unguarded, and by 
<A NAME="755"></A>degrees enticed and drew them on not only to seize upon and spoil the merchants 
<A NAME="756"></A>and ships upon the seas, but also to lay waste the islands and seaport 
<A NAME="757"></A>towns. So that now there embarked with these pirates men of wealth and 
<A NAME="758"></A>noble birth and superior abilities, as if it had been a natural occupation 
<A NAME="759"></A>to gain distinction in. They had divers arsenals, or piratic harbours, 
<A NAME="760"></A>as likewise watch-towers and beacons, all along the sea-coast; and fleets 
<A NAME="761"></A>were here received that were well manned with the finest mariners, and 
<A NAME="762"></A>well served with the expertest pilots, and composed of swift-sailing and 
<A NAME="763"></A>light-built vessels adapted for their special purpose. Nor was it merely 
<A NAME="764"></A>their being thus formidable that excited indignation; they were even more 
<A NAME="765"></A>odious for their ostentation than they were feared for their force. Their 
<A NAME="766"></A>ships had gilded masts at their stems; the sails woven of purple, and the 
<A NAME="767"></A>oars plated with silver, as if their delight were to glory in their iniquity. 
<A NAME="768"></A>There was nothing but music and dancing, banqueting and revels, all along 
<A NAME="769"></A>the shore. Officers in command were taken prisoners, and cities put under 
<A NAME="770"></A>contribution, to the reproach and dishonour of the Roman 
<A NAME="771"></A>supremacy.
<A NAME="772"></A><BR><BR>There were of these corsairs above one thousand sail, and they 
<A NAME="773"></A>had taken no less than four hundred cities, committing sacrilege upon the 
<A NAME="774"></A>temples of the gods, and enriching themselves with the spoils of many never 
<A NAME="775"></A>violated before, such as were those of Claros, Didyma, and Samothrace; 
<A NAME="776"></A>and the temple of the Earth in Hermione, and that of Aesculapius in Epidaurus, 
<A NAME="777"></A>those of Neptune at the Isthmus, at Taenarus, and at Calauria; those of 
<A NAME="778"></A>Apollo at Actium and Leucas, and those of Juno in Samos, at Argos, and 
<A NAME="779"></A>at Lacinium. They themselves offered strange sacrifices upon Mount Olympus, 
<A NAME="780"></A>and performed certain secret rites or religious mysteries, among which 
<A NAME="781"></A>those of Mithras have been preserved to our own time having received their 
<A NAME="782"></A>previous institution from them. But besides these insolencies by sea, they 
<A NAME="783"></A>were also injurious to the Romans by land; for they would often go inland 
<A NAME="784"></A>up the roads, plundering and destroying their villages and country-houses. 
<A NAME="785"></A>Once they seized upon two Roman praetors, Sextilius and Bellinus, in their 
<A NAME="786"></A>purple-edged robes, and carried them off together with their officers and 
<A NAME="787"></A>lictors. The daughter also of Antonius. a man that had had the honour of 
<A NAME="788"></A>a triumph, taking a journey into the country, was seized, and redeemed 
<A NAME="789"></A>upon payment of a large ransom. But it was most abusive of all that, when 
<A NAME="790"></A>any of the captives declared himself to be a Roman, and told his name, 
<A NAME="791"></A>they affected to be surprised, and feigning fear, smote their thighs and 
<A NAME="792"></A>fell down at his feet humbly beseeching him to be gracious and forgive 
<A NAME="793"></A>them.
<A NAME="794"></A><BR><BR>The captives, seeing them so humble and suppliant, believed them 
<A NAME="795"></A>to be in earnest; and some of them now would proceed to put Roman shoes 
<A NAME="796"></A>on his feet, and to dress him in a Roman gown, to prevent, they said, his 
<A NAME="797"></A>being mistaken another time. After all this pageantry, when they had thus 
<A NAME="798"></A>deluded and mocked him long enough, at last putting out a ship's ladder, 
<A NAME="799"></A>when they were in the midst of the sea, they told him he was free to go, 
<A NAME="800"></A>and wished him a pleasant journey; and if he resisted they themselves threw 
<A NAME="801"></A>him overboard and drowned him.
<A NAME="802"></A><BR><BR>This piratic power having got the dominion and control of all the 
<A NAME="803"></A>Mediterranean, there was left no place for navigation or commerce. And 
<A NAME="804"></A>this it was which most of all made the Romans, finding themselves to be 
<A NAME="805"></A>extremely straitened in their markets, and considering that if it should 
<A NAME="806"></A>continue, there would be a dearth and famine in the land, determined at 
<A NAME="807"></A>last to send out Pompey to recover the seas from the pirates. Gabinius, 
<A NAME="808"></A>one of Pompey's friends, preferred a law, whereby there was granted to 
<A NAME="809"></A>him, not only the government of the seas as admiral, but, in direct words, 
<A NAME="810"></A>sole and irresponsible sovereignty over all men. For the decree gave him 
<A NAME="811"></A>absolute power and authority in all the seas within the pillars of Hercules, 
<A NAME="812"></A>and in the adjacent mainland for the space of four hundred furlongs from 
<A NAME="813"></A>the sea. Now there were but few regions in the Roman empire out of that 
<A NAME="814"></A>compass; and the greatest of the nations and most powerful of the kings 
<A NAME="815"></A>were included in the limit. Moreover, by this decree he had a power of 
<A NAME="816"></A>selecting fifteen lieutenants out of the senate, and of assigning to each 
<A NAME="817"></A>his province in charge; then he might take likewise out of the treasury 
<A NAME="818"></A>and out of the hands of the revenue-farmers what moneys he pleased; as 
<A NAME="819"></A>also two hundred sail of ships, with a power to press and levy what soldiers 
<A NAME="820"></A>and seamen he thought fit.
<A NAME="821"></A><BR><BR>When this law was read, the common people approved of it exceedingly, 
<A NAME="822"></A>but the chief men and most important among the senators looked upon it 
<A NAME="823"></A>as an exorbitant power, even beyond the reach of envy, but well deserving 
<A NAME="824"></A>their fears. Therefore concluding with themselves that such unlimited authority 
<A NAME="825"></A>was dangerous, they agreed unanimously to oppose the bill, and all went 
<A NAME="826"></A>against it, except Caesar, who gave his vote for the law, not to gratify 
<A NAME="827"></A>Pompey, but the people, whose favour he had courted underhand from the 
<A NAME="828"></A>beginning, and hoped to compass for himself. The rest inveighed bitterly 
<A NAME="829"></A>against Pompey, insomuch that one of the consuls told him that, if he was 
<A NAME="830"></A>ambitious of the place of Romulus, he would scarce avoid his end, but he 
<A NAME="831"></A>was in danger of being torn to pieces by the multitude for his speech. 
<A NAME="832"></A>Yet when Catulus stood up to speak against the law, the people in reverence 
<A NAME="833"></A>to him were silent and attentive. And when, after saying much in the most 
<A NAME="834"></A>honourable terms in favour of Pompey, he proceeded to advise the people 
<A NAME="835"></A>in kindness to spare him, and not to expose a man of his value to such 
<A NAME="836"></A>a succession of dangers and wars, "For," said he, "where could you find 
<A NAME="837"></A>another Pompey, or whom would you have in case you should chance to lose 
<A NAME="838"></A>him?" they all cried out with one voice, "Yourself." And so Catulus, finding 
<A NAME="839"></A>all his rhetoric ineffectual, desisted. Then Roscius attempted to speak, 
<A NAME="840"></A>but could obtain no hearing, and made signs with his fingers, intimating, 
<A NAME="841"></A>"Not him alone," but that there might be a second Pompey or colleague in 
<A NAME="842"></A>authority with him. Upon this, it is said, the multitude, being extremely 
<A NAME="843"></A>incensed, made such a loud outcry, that a crow flying over the market-place 
<A NAME="844"></A>at that instant was struck, and dropped down among the crowd; whence it 
<A NAME="845"></A>would appear that the cause of birds falling down to the ground is not 
<A NAME="846"></A>any rupture or division of the air causing a vacuum, but purely the actual 
<A NAME="847"></A>stroke of the voice, which, when carried up in a great mass and with violence, 
<A NAME="848"></A>raises a sort of tempest and billow, as it were, in the 
<A NAME="849"></A>air.
<A NAME="850"></A><BR><BR>The assembly broke up for that day; and when the day was come on 
<A NAME="851"></A>which the bill was to pass by suffrage into a decree, Pompey went privately 
<A NAME="852"></A>into the country; but hearing that it was passed and confirmed, he returned 
<A NAME="853"></A>again into the city by night, to avoid the envy that might be occasioned 
<A NAME="854"></A>by the concourse of people that would meet and congratulate him. The next 
<A NAME="855"></A>morning he came abroad and sacrificed to the gods, and having audience 
<A NAME="856"></A>at an open assembly, so handled the matter that they enlarged his power, 
<A NAME="857"></A>giving him many things besides what was already granted, and almost doubling 
<A NAME="858"></A>the preparation appointed in the former decree. Five hundred ships were 
<A NAME="859"></A>manned for him, and an army raised of one hundred and twenty thousand foot 
<A NAME="860"></A>and five thousand horse. Twenty-four senators that had been generals of 
<A NAME="861"></A>armies were appointed to serve as lieutenants under him, and to these were 
<A NAME="862"></A>added two quaestors. Now it happened within this time that the prices of 
<A NAME="863"></A>provisions were much reduced which gave an occasion to the joyful people 
<A NAME="864"></A>of saying that the very name of Pompey had ended the war. However, Pompey, 
<A NAME="865"></A>in pursuance of his charge, divided all the seas and the whole Mediterranean 
<A NAME="866"></A>into thirteen parts, allotting a squadron to each, under the command of 
<A NAME="867"></A>his officers; and having thus dispersed his power into all quarters, and 
<A NAME="868"></A>encompassed the pirates everywhere, they began to fall into his hands by 
<A NAME="869"></A>whole shoals, which he seized and brought into his harbours. As for those 
<A NAME="870"></A>that withdrew themselves betimes, or otherwise escaped his general chase, 
<A NAME="871"></A>they all made to Cilicia, where they bid themselves as in their hives; 
<A NAME="872"></A>against whom Pompey now proceeded in person with sixty of his best ships, 
<A NAME="873"></A>not, however, until he had first scoured and cleared all the seas near 
<A NAME="874"></A>Rome, the Tyrrhenian, and the African, and all the waters of Sardinia, 
<A NAME="875"></A>Corsica, and Sicily; all which he performed in the space of forty days 
<A NAME="876"></A>by his own indefatigable industry and the zeal of his 
<A NAME="877"></A>lieutenants.
<A NAME="878"></A><BR><BR>Pompey met with some interruption in Rome, through the malice and 
<A NAME="879"></A>envy of Piso, the consul, who had given some check to his proceedings by 
<A NAME="880"></A>withholding his stores and discharging his seamen; whereupon he sent his 
<A NAME="881"></A>fleet round to Brundusium, himself going the nearest way by land through 
<A NAME="882"></A>Tuscany to Rome; which was no sooner known by the people than they all 
<A NAME="883"></A>flocked out to meet him upon the way as if they had not sent him out but 
<A NAME="884"></A>a few days before. What chiefly excited their joy was the unexpectedly 
<A NAME="885"></A>rapid change in the markets, which abounded now with the greatest plenty, 
<A NAME="886"></A>so that Piso was in great danger to have been deprived of his consulship, 
<A NAME="887"></A>Gabinius having a law ready prepared for that purpose but Pompey forbade 
<A NAME="888"></A>it, behaving himself as in that, so in all things else, with great moderation, 
<A NAME="889"></A>and when he had made sure of all that he wanted or desired, he departed 
<A NAME="890"></A>for Brundusium, whence he set sail in pursuit of the pirates. And though 
<A NAME="891"></A>he was straitened in time, and his hasty voyage forced him to sail by several 
<A NAME="892"></A>cities without touching, yet he would not pass by the city of Athens unsaluted; 
<A NAME="893"></A>but landing there, after he had sacrificed to the gods, and made an address 
<A NAME="894"></A>to the people, as he was returning out of the city, he read at the gates 
<A NAME="895"></A>two epigrams, each in a single line, written in his own praise; one within 
<A NAME="896"></A>the gate:-
<A NAME="897"></A><BR><BR>"Thy humbler thoughts make thee a god the more;" the other 
<A NAME="898"></A>without:-
<A NAME="899"></A><BR><BR>"Adieu we bid, who welcome bade before." Now because Pompey had 
<A NAME="900"></A>shown himself merciful to some of these pirates that were yet roving in 
<A NAME="901"></A>bodies about the seas, having upon their supplication ordered a seizure 
<A NAME="902"></A>of their ships and persons only, without any further process or severity, 
<A NAME="903"></A>therefore the rest of their comrades, in hopes of mercy too, made their 
<A NAME="904"></A>escape from his other commanders, and surrendered themselves with their 
<A NAME="905"></A>wives and children into his protection. He continued to pardon all that 
<A NAME="906"></A>came in, and the rather because by them he might make discovery of those 
<A NAME="907"></A>who fled from his justice, as conscious that their crimes were beyond an 
<A NAME="908"></A>act of indemnity. The most numerous and important part of these conveyed 
<A NAME="909"></A>their families and treasures, with all their people that were unfit for 
<A NAME="910"></A>war, into castles and strong forts about Mount Taurus; but they themselves, 
<A NAME="911"></A>having well manned their galleys, embarked for Coracesium in Cilicia, where 
<A NAME="912"></A>they received Pompey and gave him battle. Here they had a final overthrow, 
<A NAME="913"></A>and retired to the land, where they were besieged. At last, having despatched 
<A NAME="914"></A>their heralds to him with a submission, they delivered up to his mercy 
<A NAME="915"></A>themselves, their towns, islands, and strongholds, all which they had so 
<A NAME="916"></A>fortified that they were almost impregnable, and scarcely even 
<A NAME="917"></A>accessible.
<A NAME="918"></A><BR><BR>Thus was this war ended, and the whole power of the pirates at 
<A NAME="919"></A>sea dissolved everywhere in the space of three months, wherein, besides 
<A NAME="920"></A>a great number of other vessels, he took ninety men-of-war with brazen 
<A NAME="921"></A>beaks and likewise prisoners of war to the number of no less than twenty 
<A NAME="922"></A>thousand.
<A NAME="923"></A><BR><BR>As regarded the disposal of these prisoners, he never so much as 
<A NAME="924"></A>entertained the thought of putting them to death; and yet it might be no 
<A NAME="925"></A>less dangerous on the other hand to disperse them, as they might reunite 
<A NAME="926"></A>and make head again, being numerous, poor, and warlike. Therefore wisely 
<A NAME="927"></A>weighing with himself that man by nature is not a wild or unsocial creature, 
<A NAME="928"></A>neither was he born so, but makes himself what he naturally is not by vicious 
<A NAME="929"></A>habit; and that again, on the other side, he is civilized and grows gentle 
<A NAME="930"></A>by a change of place, occupation, and manner of life, as beasts themselves 
<A NAME="931"></A>that are wild by nature become tame and tractable by housing and gentler 
<A NAME="932"></A>usage, upon this consideration he determined to translate these pirates 
<A NAME="933"></A>from sea to land, and give them a taste of an honest and innocent course 
<A NAME="934"></A>of life by living in towns and tilling the ground. Some therefore were 
<A NAME="935"></A>admitted into the small and half-peopled towns of the Cilicians, who, for 
<A NAME="936"></A>an enlargement of their territories, were willing to receive them. Others 
<A NAME="937"></A>he planted in the city of the Solians, which had been lately laid waste 
<A NAME="938"></A>by Tigranes, King of Armenia, and which he now restored. But the largest 
<A NAME="939"></A>number were settled in Dyme, the town of Achaea, at that time extremely 
<A NAME="940"></A>depopulated, and possessing an abundance of good land.
<A NAME="941"></A><BR><BR>However, these proceedings could not escape the envy and censure 
<A NAME="942"></A>of his enemies; and the course he took against Metellus in Crete was disapproved 
<A NAME="943"></A>of even by the chiefest of his friends. For Metellus, a relation of Pompey's 
<A NAME="944"></A>former colleague in Spain, had been sent praetor into Crete, before this 
<A NAME="945"></A>province of the seas was assigned to Pompey. Now Crete was the second source 
<A NAME="946"></A>of pirates next to Cilicia, and Metellus having shut up a number of them 
<A NAME="947"></A>in their strongholds there was engaged in reducing and extirpating them. 
<A NAME="948"></A>Those that were yet remaining and besieged sent their supplications to 
<A NAME="949"></A>Pompey, and invited him into the island as a part of his province, alleging 
<A NAME="950"></A>it to fall, every part of it, within the distance from the sea specified 
<A NAME="951"></A>in his commission, and so within the precincts of his charge. Pompey receiving 
<A NAME="952"></A>the submission, sent letters to Metellus, commanding him to leave off the 
<A NAME="953"></A>war; and others in like manner to the cities, in which he charged them 
<A NAME="954"></A>not to yield any obedience to the commands of Metellus. And after these 
<A NAME="955"></A>he sent Lucius Octavius, one of his lieutenants, to act as general, who 
<A NAME="956"></A>entering the besieged fortifications, and fighting in defence of the pirates, 
<A NAME="957"></A>rendered Pompey not odious only, but even ridiculous too; that he should 
<A NAME="958"></A>lend his name as a guard to a nest of thieves, that knew neither god nor 
<A NAME="959"></A>law, and made his reputation serve as a sanctuary to them, only out of 
<A NAME="960"></A>pure envy and emulation to Metellus. For neither was Achilles thought to 
<A NAME="961"></A>act the part of a man, but rather of a mere boy, mad after glory, when 
<A NAME="962"></A>by signs he forbade the rest of the Greeks to strike at 
<A NAME="963"></A>Hector-
<A NAME="964"></A><BR><BR>"For fear
<A NAME="965"></A><BR>Some other hand should give the blow, and he
<A NAME="966"></A><BR>Lose the first honour of the victory." Whereas Pompey even sought to 
<A NAME="967"></A>preserve the common enemies of the world only that he might deprive a Roman 
<A NAME="968"></A>praetor, after all his labours of the honour of a triumph. Metellus, however, 
<A NAME="969"></A>was not daunted, but prosecuted the war against the pirates, expelled them 
<A NAME="970"></A>from their strongholds and punished them; and dismissed Octavius with the 
<A NAME="971"></A>insults and reproaches of the whole camp.
<A NAME="972"></A><BR><BR>When the news came to Rome that the war with the pirates was at 
<A NAME="973"></A>an end, and that Pompey was unoccupied, diverting himself in visits to 
<A NAME="974"></A>the cities for want of employment, one Manlius, a tribune of the people, 
<A NAME="975"></A>preferred a law that Pompey should have all the forces of Lucullus, and 
<A NAME="976"></A>the provinces under his government, together with Bithynia, which was under 
<A NAME="977"></A>the command of Glabrio; and that he should forthwith conduct the war against 
<A NAME="978"></A>the two kings, Mithridates and Tigranes, retaining still the same naval 
<A NAME="979"></A>forces and the sovereignty of the seas as before. But this was nothing 
<A NAME="980"></A>less than to constitute one absolute monarch of all the Roman empire. For 
<A NAME="981"></A>the provinces which seemed to be exempt from his commission by the former 
<A NAME="982"></A>decree, such as were Phrygia, Lycaonia, Galatia, Cappadocia, Cilicia, the 
<A NAME="983"></A>upper Colchis, and Armenia, were all added in by this latter law, together 
<A NAME="984"></A>with all the troops and forces with which Lucullus had defeated Mithridates 
<A NAME="985"></A>and Tigranes. And though Lucullus was thus simply robbed of the glory of 
<A NAME="986"></A>his achievements in having a successor assigned him, rather to the honour 
<A NAME="987"></A>of his triumph than the danger of the war; yet this was of less moment 
<A NAME="988"></A>in the eyes of the aristocratical party, though they could not but admit 
<A NAME="989"></A>the injustice and ingratitude to Lucullus. But their great grievance was 
<A NAME="990"></A>that the power of Pompey should be converted into a manifest tyranny; and 
<A NAME="991"></A>they therefore exhorted and encouraged one another privately to bend all 
<A NAME="992"></A>their forces in opposition to this law, and not tamely to cast away their 
<A NAME="993"></A>liberty; yet when the day came on which it was to pass into a decree, their 
<A NAME="994"></A>hearts failed them for fear of the people, and all were silent except Catulus, 
<A NAME="995"></A>who boldly inveighed against the law and its proposer, and when he found 
<A NAME="996"></A>that he could do nothing with the people, turned to the senate, crying 
<A NAME="997"></A>out and bidding them seek out some mountain as their forefathers had done, 
<A NAME="998"></A>and fly to the rocks where they might preserve their liberty. The law passed 
<A NAME="999"></A>into a decree, as it is said, by the suffrages of all the tribes. And Pompey, 
<A NAME="1000"></A>in his absence, was made lord of almost all that power which Sylla only 
<A NAME="1001"></A>obtained by force of arms, after a conquest of the very city 
<A NAME="1002"></A>itself.
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR><BR>When Pompey had advice by letters of the decree, it is said that 
<A NAME="1004"></A>in the presence of his friends, who came to give him joy of his honour, 
<A NAME="1005"></A>he seemed displeased, frowning and smiting his thigh, and exclaimed as 
<A NAME="1006"></A>ore over-burdened and weary of government, "Alas, what a series of labours 
<A NAME="1007"></A>upon labours! If I am never to end my service as a soldier, nor to escape 
<A NAME="1008"></A>from this invidious greatness and live at home in the country with my wife, 
<A NAME="1009"></A>I had better have been an unknown man." But all this was looked upon as 
<A NAME="1010"></A>mere trifling, neither indeed could the best of his friends call it anything 
<A NAME="1011"></A>else, well knowing that his enmity with Lucullus, setting a flame just 
<A NAME="1012"></A>now to his natural passion for glory and empire, made him feel more than 
<A NAME="1013"></A>usually gratified.
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR><BR>As indeed appeared not long afterwards by his actions, which clearly 
<A NAME="1015"></A>unmasked him; for, in the first place, he sent out his proclamations into 
<A NAME="1016"></A>all quarters, commanding the soldiers to join him, and summoned all the 
<A NAME="1017"></A>tributary kings and princes within his charge; and in short, as soon as 
<A NAME="1018"></A>he had entered upon his province, he left nothing unaltered that had been 
<A NAME="1019"></A>done and established by Lucullus. To some he remitted their penalties, 
<A NAME="1020"></A>and deprived others of their rewards, and acted in all respects as if with 
<A NAME="1021"></A>the express design that the admirers of Lucullus might know that all his 
<A NAME="1022"></A>authority was at an end.
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR><BR>Lucullus expostulated by friends, and it was thought fitting that 
<A NAME="1024"></A>there should be a meeting betwixt them; and accordingly they met in the 
<A NAME="1025"></A>country of Galatia. As they were both great and successful generals, their 
<A NAME="1026"></A>officers bore their rods before them all wreathed with branches of laurel; 
<A NAME="1027"></A>Lucullus came through a country full of green trees and shady woods, but 
<A NAME="1028"></A>Pompey's march was through a cold and barren district. Therefore the lictors 
<A NAME="1029"></A>of Lucullus, perceiving that Pompey's laurels were withered and dry, helped 
<A NAME="1030"></A>him to some of their own, and adorned and crowned his rods with fresh laurels. 
<A NAME="1031"></A>This was thought ominous, and looked as if Pompey came to take away the 
<A NAME="1032"></A>reward and honour of Lucullus's victories. Lucullus had the priority in 
<A NAME="1033"></A>the order of consulships, and also in age; but Pompey's two triumphs made 
<A NAME="1034"></A>him the greater man. Their first addresses in this interview were dignified 
<A NAME="1035"></A>and friendly, each magnifying the other's actions, and offering congratulations 
<A NAME="1036"></A>upon his success. But when they came to the matter of their conference 
<A NAME="1037"></A>or treaty, they could agree on no fair or equitable terms of any kind, 
<A NAME="1038"></A>but even came to harsh words against each other, Pompey upbraiding Lucullus 
<A NAME="1039"></A>with avarice, and Lucullus retorting ambition upon Pompey, so that their 
<A NAME="1040"></A>friends could hardly part them. Lucullus remaining in Galatia, made a distribution 
<A NAME="1041"></A>of the lands within his conquests, and gave presents to whom he pleased; 
<A NAME="1042"></A>and Pompey encamping not far distant from him, sent out his prohibitions, 
<A NAME="1043"></A>forbidding the execution of any of the orders of Lucullus, and commanded 
<A NAME="1044"></A>away all his soldiers, except sixteen hundred, whom he thought likely to 
<A NAME="1045"></A>be unserviceable to himself, being disorderly and mutinous, and whom he 
<A NAME="1046"></A>knew to be hostile to Lucullus; and to these acts he added satirical speeches, 
<A NAME="1047"></A>detracting openly from the glory of his actions, and giving out that the 
<A NAME="1048"></A>battles of Lucullus had been but with the mere stage-shows and idle pictures 
<A NAME="1049"></A>of royal pomp, whereas the real war against a genuine army, disciplined 
<A NAME="1050"></A>by defeat, was reserved to him, Mithridates having now begun to be in earnest, 
<A NAME="1051"></A>and having betaken himself to his shields, swords, and horses. Lucullus, 
<A NAME="1052"></A>on the other side, to be even with him, replied, that Pompey came to fight 
<A NAME="1053"></A>with the mere image and shadow of war, it being his usual practice, like 
<A NAME="1054"></A>a lazy bird of prey, to come upon the carcass when others had slain the 
<A NAME="1055"></A>dead, and to tear in pieces the relics of a war.
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR><BR>Thus he had appropriated to himself the victories over Sertorius, 
<A NAME="1057"></A>over Lepidus, and over the insurgents under Spartacus; whereas this last 
<A NAME="1058"></A>had been achieved by Crassus, that obtained by Catulus, and the first won 
<A NAME="1059"></A>by Metellus. And therefore it was no great wonder that the glory of the 
<A NAME="1060"></A>Pontic and Armenian war should be usurped by a man who had condescended 
<A NAME="1061"></A>to any artifices to work himself into the honour of a triumph over a few 
<A NAME="1062"></A>runaway slaves.
<A NAME="1063"></A><BR><BR>After this Lucullus went away, and Pompey having placed his whole 
<A NAME="1064"></A>navy in guard upon the seas betwixt Phoenicia and Bosphorus, himself marched 
<A NAME="1065"></A>against Mithridates, who had a phalanx of thirty thousand foot, with two 
<A NAME="1066"></A>thousand horse, yet durst not bid him battle. He had encamped upon a strong 
<A NAME="1067"></A>mountain where it would have been hard to attack him, but abandoned it 
<A NAME="1068"></A>in no long time as destitute of water. No sooner was be gone but Pompey 
<A NAME="1069"></A>occupied it, and observing the plants that were thriving there, together 
<A NAME="1070"></A>with the hollows which he found in several places, conjectured that such 
<A NAME="1071"></A>a plot could not be without springs, and therefore ordered his men to sink 
<A NAME="1072"></A>wells in every corner. After which there was, in a little time, great plenty 
<A NAME="1073"></A>of water throughout all the camp, insomuch that he wondered how it was 
<A NAME="1074"></A>possible for Mithridates to be ignorant of this, during all that time of 
<A NAME="1075"></A>his encampment there. After this Pompey followed him to his next camp, 
<A NAME="1076"></A>and there drawing lines round about him, shut him in. But he, after having 
<A NAME="1077"></A>endured a siege of forty-five days, made his escape secretly, and fled 
<A NAME="1078"></A>away with all the best part of his army, having first put to death all 
<A NAME="1079"></A>the sick and unserviceable. Not long after Pompey overtook him again near 
<A NAME="1080"></A>the banks of the river Euphrates, and encamped close by him; but fearing 
<A NAME="1081"></A>lest he should pass over the river and give him the slip there too, he 
<A NAME="1082"></A>drew up his army to attack him at midnight. And at that very time Mithridates, 
<A NAME="1083"></A>it is said, saw a vision in his dream foreshowing what should come to pass. 
<A NAME="1084"></A>For he seemed to be under sail in the Euxine Sea with a prosperous gale, 
<A NAME="1085"></A>and just in
