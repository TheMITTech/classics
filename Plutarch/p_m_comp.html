<A NAME="2"></A><BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>These are the memorable things I have found in historians concerning Marcellus 
<A NAME="11"></A>and Pelopidas. Betwixt which two great men, though in natural character 
<A NAME="12"></A>and manners they nearly resemble each other, because both were valiant 
<A NAME="13"></A>and diligent, daring and high-spirited, there was yet some diversity in 
<A NAME="14"></A>the one point, that Marcellus in many cities which he reduced under his 
<A NAME="15"></A>power committed great slaughter; but Epaminondas and Pelopidas never after 
<A NAME="16"></A>any victory put men to death, or reduced citizens to slavery. And we are 
<A NAME="17"></A>told, too, that the Thebans would not, had these been present, have taken 
<A NAME="18"></A>the measures they did against the Orchomenians. Marcellus's exploits against 
<A NAME="19"></A>the Gauls are admirable and ample; when, accompanied by a few horse, he 
<A NAME="20"></A>defeated and put to flight a vast number of horse and foot together (an 
<A NAME="21"></A>action you cannot easily in historians find to have been done by any other 
<A NAME="22"></A>captain), and took their king prisoner. To which honour Pelopidas aspired, 
<A NAME="23"></A>but did not attain; he was killed by the tyrant in the attempt. But to 
<A NAME="24"></A>these you may perhaps oppose those two most glorious battles at Leuctra 
<A NAME="25"></A>and Tegyrae; and we have no statement of any achievement of Marcellus, 
<A NAME="26"></A>by stealth or ambuscade, such as were those of Pelopidas, when he returned 
<A NAME="27"></A>from exile, and killed the tyrants at Thebes; which, indeed, may claim 
<A NAME="28"></A>to be called the first in rank of all achievements ever performed by secrecy 
<A NAME="29"></A>and cunning. Hannibal was, indeed, a most formidable enemy for the Romans; 
<A NAME="30"></A>but so for that matter were the Lacedaemonians for the Thebans. And that 
<A NAME="31"></A>these were, in the fights of Leuctra and Tegyrae, beaten and put to flight 
<A NAME="32"></A>by Pelopidas is confessed; whereas Polybius writes that Hannibal was never 
<A NAME="33"></A>so much as once vanquished by Marcellus, but remained invincible in all 
<A NAME="34"></A>encounters till Scipio came. I myself, indeed, have followed rather Livy, 
<A NAME="35"></A>Caesar, Cornelius Nepos and among the Greeks, King Juba, in stating that 
<A NAME="36"></A>the troops of Hannibal were in some encounters routed and put to flight 
<A NAME="37"></A>by Marcellus; but certainly these defeats conducted little to the sum of 
<A NAME="38"></A>the war. It would seem as if they had been merely feints of some sort on 
<A NAME="39"></A>the part of the Carthaginians. What was indeed truly and really admirable 
<A NAME="40"></A>was, that the Romans, after the defeat of so many armies, the slaughter 
<A NAME="41"></A>of so many captains, and, in fine, the confusion of almost the whole Roman 
<A NAME="42"></A>empire, still showed a courage equal to their losses, and were as willing 
<A NAME="43"></A>as their enemies to engage in new battles. And Marcellus was the one man 
<A NAME="44"></A>who overcame the great and inveterate fear and dread, and revived, raised, 
<A NAME="45"></A>and confirmed the spirits of the soldiers to that degree of emulation and 
<A NAME="46"></A>bravery that would not let them easily yield the victory, but made them 
<A NAME="47"></A>contend for it to the last. For the same men, whom continual defeats had 
<A NAME="48"></A>accustomed to think themselves happy, if they could but save themselves 
<A NAME="49"></A>by running from Hannibal, were by him taught to esteem it base and ignominious 
<A NAME="50"></A>to return safe but unsuccessful; to be ashamed to confess that they had 
<A NAME="51"></A>yielded one step in the terrors of the fight and to grieve to extremity 
<A NAME="52"></A>if they were not victorious.
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR>In short, as Pelopidas was never overcome in any battle, where 
<A NAME="54"></A>himself was present and commanded in chief, and as Marcellus gained more 
<A NAME="55"></A>victories than any of his contemporaries, truly he that could not be easily 
<A NAME="56"></A>overcome, considering his many successes, may fairly be compared with him 
<A NAME="57"></A>who was undefeated. Marcellus took Syracuse; whereas Pelopidas was frustrated 
<A NAME="58"></A>of his hope of capturing Sparta. But in my judgment it was more difficult 
<A NAME="59"></A>to advance his standard even to the walls of Sparta, and to be the first 
<A NAME="60"></A>of mortals that ever passed the river Eurotas in arms, than it was to reduce 
<A NAME="61"></A>Sicily; unless, indeed, we say that that adventure is with more of right 
<A NAME="62"></A>to be attributed to Epaminondas, as was also the Leuctrian battle; whereas 
<A NAME="63"></A>Marcellus's renown, and the glory of his brave actions, came entire and 
<A NAME="64"></A>undiminished to him alone. For he alone took Syracuse; and without his 
<A NAME="65"></A>colleague's help defeated the Gauls, and, when all others declined, alone, 
<A NAME="66"></A>without one companion, ventured to engage with Hannibal; and changing the 
<A NAME="67"></A>aspect of the war first showed the example of daring to attack 
<A NAME="68"></A>him.
<A NAME="69"></A><BR><BR>I cannot commend the death of either of these great men; the suddenness 
<A NAME="70"></A>and strangeness of their ends gives me a feeling rather of pain and distress. 
<A NAME="71"></A>Hannibal has my admiration who, in so many severe conflicts, more than 
<A NAME="72"></A>can be reckoned in one day, never received so much as one wound. I honour 
<A NAME="73"></A>Chrysantes also (in Xenophon's Cyropaedia), who, having raised his sword 
<A NAME="74"></A>in the act of striking his enemy, so soon as a retreat was sounded, left 
<A NAME="75"></A>him, and retired sedately and modestly. Yet the anger which provoked Pelopidas 
<A NAME="76"></A>to pursue revenge in the heat of fight may excuse him.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>"The first thing for a captain is to gain
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>Safe victory; the next to be with honour slain," as Euripides says. 
<A NAME="79"></A>For then he cannot be said to suffer death; it is rather to be called an 
<A NAME="80"></A>action. The very object, too, of Pelopidas's victory, which consisted in 
<A NAME="81"></A>the slaughter of the tyrant, presenting itself to his eyes, did not wholly 
<A NAME="82"></A>carry him away unadvisedly: he could not easily expect again to have another 
<A NAME="83"></A>equally glorious occasion for the exercise of his courage in a noble and 
<A NAME="84"></A>honourable cause. But Marcellus, when it made little to his advantage, 
<A NAME="85"></A>and when no such violent ardour as present danger naturally calls out transported 
<A NAME="86"></A>him to passion, throwing himself into danger, fell to an unexplored ambush; 
<A NAME="87"></A>he, namely, who had borne five consulates, led three triumphs, won the 
<A NAME="88"></A>spoils and glories of kings and victories, to act the part of a mere scout, 
<A NAME="89"></A>or sentinel, and to expose all his achievements to be trod under foot by 
<A NAME="90"></A>the mercenary Spaniards and Numidians, who sold themselves and their lives 
<A NAME="91"></A>to the Carthaginians, so that even they themselves felt unworthy, and almost 
<A NAME="92"></A>grudged themselves the unhoped-for success of having cut off, among a few 
<A NAME="93"></A>Fregellan scouts, the most valiant, the most potent, and most renowned 
<A NAME="94"></A>of the Romans. Let no man think that we have thus spoken out of a design 
<A NAME="95"></A>to accuse these noble men; it is merely an expression of frank indignation 
<A NAME="96"></A>in their own behalf, at seeing them thus wasting all their other virtues 
<A NAME="97"></A>upon that of bravery, and throwing away their lives, as if the loss would 
<A NAME="98"></A>be only felt by themselves, and not by their country, allies, and 
<A NAME="99"></A>friends.
<A NAME="100"></A><BR><BR>After Pelopidas's death, his friends, for whom he died, made a 
<A NAME="101"></A>funeral for him; the enemies, by whom he had been killed, made one for 
<A NAME="102"></A>Marcellus. A noble and happy lot indeed the former; yet there is something 
<A NAME="103"></A>higher and greater in the admiration rendered by enemies to the virtue 
<A NAME="104"></A>that had been their own obstacle, than in the grateful acknowledgments 
<A NAME="105"></A>of friends. Since, in the one case, it is virtue alone that challenges 
<A NAME="106"></A>itself the honour; while, in the other, it may be rather men's personal 
<A NAME="107"></A>profit and advantage that is the real origin of what they 
<A NAME="108"></A>do.
