Themistocles
By Plutarch

(legendary, died 365 B.C.E.)


Translated by John Dryden

The birth of Themistocles was somewhat too obscure to do him honour.
His father, Neocles, was not of the distinguished people of Athens,
but of the township Phrearrhi, and of the tribe Leontis; and by his
mother's side, as it is reported, he was base-born- 

"I am not of the noble Grecian race, 
I'm poor Abrotonon, and born in Thrace; 
Let the Greek women scorn me, if they please, 
I was the mother of Themistocles." 

Yet Phanias writes that the mother of Themistocles was not of Thrace,
but of Caria, and that her name was not Abrotonon, but Euterpe; and
Neanthes adds farther that she was of Halicarnassus in Caria. And,
as illegitimate children, including those that were of half-blood
or had but one parent an Athenian, had to attend at the Cynosarges
(a wrestling-place outside the gates, dedicated to Hercules, who was
also of half-blood amongst the gods, having had a mortal woman for
his mother), Themistocles persuaded several of the young men of high
birth to accompany him to anoint and exercise themselves together
at Cynosarges; an ingenious device for destroying the distinction
between the noble and the base-born, and between those of the whole
and those of the half-blood of Athens. However, it is certain that
he was related to the house of Lycomedae; for Simonides records that
he rebuilt the chapel of Phlya, belonging to that family, and beautified
it with pictures and other ornaments, after it had been burnt by the
Persians. 

It is confessed by all that from his youth he was of a vehement and
impetuous nature, of a quick apprehension, and a strong and aspiring
bent for action and great affairs. The holidays and intervals in his
studies he did not spend in play or idleness, as other children, but
would be always inventing or arranging some oration or declamation
to himself, the subject of which was generally the excusing or accusing
his companions, so that his master would often say to him, "You, my
boy, will be nothing small, but great one way or other, for good or
else for bad." He received reluctantly and carelessly instructions
given him to improve his manners and behaviour, or to teach him any
pleasing or graceful accomplishment, but whatever was said to improve
him in sagacity, or in management of affairs, he would give attention
to, beyond one of his years, from confidence in his natural capacities
for such things. And thus afterwards, when in company where people
engaged themselves in what are commonly thought the liberal and elegant
amusements, he was obliged to defend himself against the observations
of those who considered themselves highly accomplished, by the somewhat
arrogant retort, that he certainly could not make use of any stringed
instrument, could only, were a small and obscure city put into his
hands, make it great and glorious. Notwithstanding this, Stesimbrotus
says that Themistocles was a hearer of Anaxagoras, and that he studied
natural philosophy under Melissus, contrary to chronology; Melissus
commanded the Samians in the siege by Pericles, who was much Themistocles's
junior; and with Pericles, also, Anaxagoras was intimate. They, therefore,
might rather be credited who report, that Themistocles was an admirer
of Mnesiphilus the Phrearrhian, who was neither rhetorican nor natural
philosopher, but a professor of that which was then called wisdom,
consisting in a sort of political shrewdness and practical sagacity,
which had begun and continued, almost like a sect of philosophy, from
Solon: but those who came afterwards, and mixed it with pleadings
and legal artifices, and transformed the practical part of it into
a mere art of speaking and an exercise of words, were generally called
sophists. Themistocles resorted to Mnesiphilus when he had already
embarked in politics. 

In the first essays of his youth he was not regular nor happily balanced;
he allowed himself to follow mere natural character, which, without
the control of reason and instruction, is apt to hurry, upon either
side, into sudden and violent courses, and very often to break away
and determine upon the worst; as he afterwards owned himself, saying,
that the wildest colts make the best horses, if they only get properly
trained and broken in. But those who upon this fasten stories of their
own invention, as of his being disowned by his father, and that his
mother died for grief of her son's ill-fame, certainly calumniate
him; and there are others who relate, on the contrary, how that to
deter him from public business, and to let him see how the vulgar
behave themselves towards their leaders when they have at last no
farther use of them, his father showed him the old galleys as they
lay forsaken and cast about upon the sea-shore. 

Yet it is evident that his mind was early imbued with the keenest
interest in public affairs, and the most passionate ambition for distinction.
Eager from the first to obtain the highest place, he unhesitatingly
accepted the hatred of the most powerful and influential leaders in
the city, but more especially of Aristides, the son of Lysimachus,
who always opposed him. And yet all this great enmity between them
arose, it appears, from a very boyish occasion, both being attached
to the beautiful Stesilaus of Ceos, as Ariston the philosopher tells
us; ever after which they took opposite sides, and were rivals in
politics. Not but that the incompatibility of their lives and manners
may seem to have increased the difference, for Aristides was of a
mild nature, and of a nobler sort of character, and, in public matters,
acting always with a view, not to glory or popularity, but to the
best interest of the state consistently with safety and honesty, he
was often forced to oppose Themistocles, and interfere against the
increase of his influence, seeing him stirring up the people to all
kinds of enterprises, and introducing various innovations. For it
is said that Themistocles was so transported with the thoughts of
glory and so inflamed with the passion for great actions, that, though
he was still young when the battle of Marathon was fought against
the Persians, upon the skilful conduct of the general, Miltiades,
being everywhere talked about, he was observed to be thoughtful and
reserved, alone by himself; he passed the nights without sleep, and
avoided all his usual places of recreation, and to those who wondered
at the change, and inquired the reason of it, he gave the answer,
that "the trophy of Miltiades would not let him sleep." And when others
were of opinion that the battle of Marathon would be an end to the
war, Themistocles thought that it was but the beginning for far greater
conflicts, and for these, to the benefit of all Greece, he kept himself
in continual readiness, and his city also in proper training, foreseeing
from far before what would happen. 

And, first of all, the Athenians being accustomed to divide amongst
themselves the revenue proceeding from the silver mines at Laurium,
he was the only man that durst propose to the people that this distribution
should cease, and that with the money ships should be built to make
war against the Aeginetans, who were the most flourishing people in
all Greece, and by the number of their ships held the sovereignty
of the sea; and Themistocles thus was more easily able to persuade
them, avoiding all mention of danger from Darius or the Persians,
who were at a great distance, and their coming very uncertain, and
at that time not much to be feared; but by a seasonable employment
of the emulation and anger felt by the Athenians against the Aeginetans,
he induced them to preparation. So that with this money an hundred
ships were built, with which they afterwards fought against Xerxes.
And henceforward, little by little, turning and drawing the city down
towards the sea, in the belief that, whereas by land they were not
a fit match for their next neighbours, with their ships they might
be able to repel the Persians and command Greece, thus, as Plato says,
from steady soldiers he turned them into mariners and seamen tossed
about the sea, and gave occasion for the reproach against him, that
he took away from the Athenians the spear and the shield, and bound
them to the bench and the oar. These measures he carried in the assembly,
against the opposition, as Stesimbrotus relates, of Miltiades; and
whether or no be hereby injured the purity and true balance of government
may be a question for philosophers, but that the deliverance of Greece
came at that time from the sea, and that these galleys restored Athens
again after it was destroyed, were others wanting, Xerxes himself
would be sufficient evidence, who, though his land-forces were still
entire, after his defeat at sea, fled away, and thought himself no
longer able to encounter the Greeks; and, as it seems to me, left
Mardonius behind him, not out of any hopes he could have to bring
them into subjection, but to hinder them from pursuing him.

Themistocles is said to have been eager in the acquisition of riches,
according to some, that he might be the more liberal; for loving to
sacrifice often, and to be splendid in his entertainment of strangers,
he required a plentiful revenue; yet he is accused by others of having
been parsimonious and sordid to that degree that he would sell provisions
which were sent to him as a present. He desired Diphilides, who was
a breeder of horses, to give him a colt, and when he refused it, threatened
that in a short time he would turn his house into a wooden horse,
intimating that he would stir up dispute and litigation between him
and some of his relations. 

He went beyond all men in the passion for distinction. When he was
still young and unknown in the world, he entreated Episcles of Hermione,
who had a good hand at the lute and was much sought after by the Athenians,
to come and practise at home with him, being ambitious of having people
inquire after his house and frequent his company. When he came to
the Olympic games, and was so splendid in his equipage and entertainments,
in his rich tents and furniture, that he strove to outdo Cimon, he
displeased the Greeks, who thought that such magnificence might be
allowed in one who was a young man and of a great family, but was
a great piece of insolence in one as yet undistinguished, and without
title or means for making any such display. In a dramatic contest,
the play he paid for won the price, which was then a matter that excited
much emulation; he put up a tablet in record of it, with the inscription:
"Themistocles of Phrearrhi was at the charge of it; Phrynichus made
it; Adimantus was archon." He was well liked by the common people,
would salute every particular citizen by his own name, and always
show himself a just judge in questions of business between private
men; he said to Simonides, the poet of Ceos, who desired something
of him, when he was commander of the army, that was not reasonable,
"Simonides, you would be no good poet if you wrote false measure,
nor should I be a good magistrate if for favour I made false law."
and at another time, laughing at Simonides, he said, that he was a
man of little judgment to speak against the Corinthians, who were
inhabitants of a great city, and to have his own picture drawn so
often, having so ill-looking a face. 

Gradually growing to be great, and winning the favour of the people,
he at last gained the day with his faction over that of Aristides,
and procured his banishment by ostracism. When the king of Persia
was now advancing against Greece, and the Athenians were in consultation
who should be general, and many withdrew themselves of their own accord,
being terrified with the greatness of the danger, there was one Epicydes,
a popular speaker, son to Euphemides a man of an elegant tongue, but
of a faint heart, and a slave to riches who was desirous of the command,
and was looked upon to be in a fair way to carry it by the number
of votes; but Themistocles, fearing that, if the command should fall
into such hands, all would be lost, bought off Epicydes and his pretensions,
it is said, for a sum of money. 

When the king of Persia sent messengers into Greece, with an interpreter,
to demand earth and water, as an acknowledgment of subjection, Themistocles,
by the consent of the people, seized upon the interpreter, and put
him to death, for presuming to publish the barbarian orders and decrees
in the Greek language; this is one of the actions he is commended
for, as also for what he did to Arthmius of Zelea, who brought gold
from the king of Persia to corrupt the Greeks, and was, by an order
from Themistocles, degraded and disfranchised, he and his children
and his posterity; but that which most of all redounded to his credit
was, that he put an end to all the civil wars of Greece, composed
their differences, and persuaded them to lay aside all enmity during
the war with the Persians; and in this great work, Chileus the Arcadian
was, it is said, of great assistance to him. 

Having taken upon himself the command of the Athenian forces, he immediately
endeavoured to persuade the citizens to leave the city, and to embark
upon their galleys, and meet with the Persians at a great distance
from Greece; but many being against this, he led a large force, together
with the Lacedaemonians, into Tempe, that in this pass they might
maintain the safety of Thessaly, which had not as yet declared for
the king; but when they returned without performing anything, and
it was known that not only the Thessalians, but all as far as Boeotia,
was going over to Xerxes, then the Athenians more willingly hearkened
to the advice of Themistocles to fight by sea, and sent him with a
fleet to guard the straits of Artemisium. 

When the contingents met here, the Greeks would have the Lacedaemonians
to command, and Eurybiades to be their admiral; but the Athenians,
who surpassed all the rest together in number of vessels, would not
submit to come after any other, till Themistocles, perceiving the
danger of the contest, yielded his own command to Eurybiades, and
got the Athenians to submit, extenuating the loss by persuading them,
that if in this war they behaved themselves like men, he would answer
for it after that, that the Greeks, of their own will, would submit
to their command. And by this moderation of his, it is evident that
he was the chief means of the deliverance of Greece, and gained the
Athenians the glory of alike surpassing their enemies in valour, and
their confederates in wisdom. 

As soon as the Persian armada arrived at Aphetae, Eurybiades was astonished
to see such a vast number of vessels before him, and being informed
that two hundred more were sailing around behind the island of Sciathus,
he immediately determined to retire farther into Greece, and to sail
back into some part of Peloponnesus, where their land army and their
fleet might join, for he looked upon the Persian forces to be altogether
unassailable by sea. But the Euboeans, fearing that the Greeks would
forsake them, and leave them to the mercy of the enemy, sent Pelagon
to confer privately with Themistocles, taking with him a good sum
of money, which, as Herodotus reports, he accepted and gave to Eurybiades.
In this affair none of his own countrymen opposed him so much as Architeles,
captain of the sacred galley, who, having no money to supply his seamen,
was eager to go home; but Themistocles so incensed the Athenians against
them, that they set upon him and left him not so much as his supper,
at which Architeles was much surprised, and took it very ill; but
Themistocles immediately sent him in a chest a service of provisions,
and at the bottom of it a talent of silver, desiring him to sup tonight,
and to-morrow provide for his seamen; if not, he would report it among
the Athenians that he had received money from the enemy. So Phanias
the Lesbian tells the story. 

Though the fights between the Greeks and Persians in the straits of
Euboea were not so important as to make any final decision of the
war, yet the experience which the Greeks obtained in them was of great
advantage; for thus, by actual trial and in real danger, they found
out that neither number of ships, nor riches and ornaments, nor boasting
shouts, nor barbarous songs of victory, were any way terrible to men
that knew how to fight, and were resolved to come hand to hand with
their enemies; these things they were to despise, and to come up close
and grapple with their foes. This Pindar appears to have seen, and
says justly enough of the fight at Artemisium, that- 

"There the sons of Athens set 
The stone that freedom stands on yet." For the first step towards
victory undoubtedly is to gain courage, Artemisium is in Euboea, beyond
the city of Histiaea, a sea-beach open to the north; most nearly opposite
to it stands Olizon, in the country which formally was under Philoctetes;
there is a small temple there, dedicated to Diana, surnamed of the
Dawn, and trees about it, around which again stand pillars of white
marble; and if you rub them with your hand, they send forth both the
smell and colour of saffron. On one of these pillars these verses
are engraved:- 

"With numerous tribes from Asia's region brought 
The sons of Athens on these waters fought; 
Erecting, after they had quelled the Mede, 
To Artemis this record of the deed." There is a place still to be
seen upon this shore, where, in the middle of a great heap of sand,
they take out from the bottom a dark powder like ashes, or something
that has passed the fire; and here, it is supposed, the shipwrecks
and bodies of the dead were burnt. 

But when news came from Thermopylae to Artemisium informing them that
king Leonidas was slain, and that Xerxes had made himself master of
all the passages by land, they returned back to the interior of Greece,
the Athenians having the command of the rear, the place of honour
and danger, and much elated by what had been done. 

As Themistocles sailed along the coasts, he took notice of the harbours
and fit places for the enemy's ships to come to land at, and engraved
large letters in such stones as he found there by chance, as also
in others which he set up on purpose near to the landing-places, or
where they were to water; in which inscriptions he called upon the
Ionians to forsake the Medes, if it were possible, and to come over
to the Greeks, who were their proper founders and fathers, and were
now hazarding all for their liberties; but, if this could not be done,
at any rate to impede and disturb the Persians in all engagements.
He hoped that these writings would prevail with the Ionians to revolt,
or raise some trouble by making their fidelity doubtful to the Persians.

Now, though Xerxes has already passed through Doris and invaded the
country of Phocis, and was burning and destroying the cities of the
Phocians, yet the Greeks sent them no relief; and, though the Athenians
earnestly desired them to meet the Persians in Boeotia, before they
could come into Attica, as they themselves had come forward by sea
at Artemisium, they gave no ear to their requests, being wholly intent
upon Peloponnesus, and resolved to gather all their forces together
within the Isthmus, and to build a wall from sea to sea in that narrow
neck of land; so that the Athenians were enraged to see themselves
betrayed, and at the same time afflicted and dejected at their own
destitution. For to fight alone against such a numerous army was to
no purpose, and the only expedient now left them was to leave their
city and cling to their ships; which the people were very unwilling
to submit to, imagining that it would signify little now to gain a
victory, and not understanding how there could be deliverance any
longer after they had once forsaken the temples of their gods and
exposed the tombs and monuments of their ancestors to the fury of
their enemies. 

Themistocles, being at a loss, and not able to draw the people over
to his opinion by any human reason, set his machines to work, as in
a theatre, and employed prodigies and oracles. The serpent of Minerva,
kept in the inner part of her temple, disappeared; the priest gave
it out to the people that the offerings which were set for it were
found untouched, and declared, by the suggestion of Themistocles,
that the goddess had left the city, and taken her flight before them
towards the sea. And he often urged them with the oracle which bade
them trust to walls of wood, showing them that walls of wood could
signify nothing else but ships- and that the island of Salamis was
termed in it, not miserable or unhappy, but had the epithet of divine,
for that it should one day be associated with a great good fortune
of the Greeks. At length his opinion prevailed, and he obtained a
decree that the city should be committed to the protection of Minerva,
"Queen of Athens;" that they who were of age to bear arms should embark,
and that each should see to sending away his children, women, and
slaves where he could. This decree being confirmed, most of the Athenians
removed their parents, wives, and children to Troezen, where they
were received with eager good-will by the Troezenians, who passed
a vote that they should be maintained at the public charge, by a daily
payment of two obols to every one, and leave be given to the children
to gather fruit where they pleased, and schoolmasters paid to instruct
them. This vote was proposed by Nicagoras. 

There was no public treasure at that time in Athens; but the council
of Areopagus, as Aristotle says, distributed to every one that served
eight drachmas, which was a great help to the manning of the fleet;
but Clidemus ascribes this also to the art of Themistocles. When the
Athenians were on their way down to the haven of Piraeus, the shield
with the head of Medusa was missing; and be, under the pretext of
searching for it, ransacked all places, and found among their goods
considerable sums of money concealed, which he applied to the public
use; and with this the soldiers and seamen were well provided for
their voyage. 

When the whole city of Athens were going on board, it afforded a spectacle
worthy alike of pity and admiration, to see them thus send away their
fathers and children before them, and, unmoved with their cries and
tears, passed over into the island. But that which stirred compassion
most of all was, that many old men, by reason of their great age,
were left behind; and even the tame domestic animals could not be
seen without some pity, running about the town and howling, as desirous
to be carried along with their masters that had kept them; among which
it is reported that Xanthippus, the father of Pericles, had a dog
that would not endure to stay behind, but leaped into the sea, and
swam along by the galley's side till he came to the island of Salamis,
where he fainted away and died, and that spot in the island, which
is still called the Dog's Grave, is said to be his. 

Among the great actions of Themistocles at this crisis, the recall
of Aristides was not the least, for, before the war, he had been ostracized
by the party which Themistocles headed, and was in banishment; but
now, perceiving that the people regretted his absence, and were fearful
that he might go over to the Persians to revenge himself, and thereby
ruin the affairs of Greece, Themistocles proposed a decree that those
who were banished for a time might return again, to give assistance
by word and deed to the cause of Greece with the rest of their fellow-citizens.

Eurybiades, by reason of the greatness of Sparta, was admiral of the
Greek fleet, but yet was faint-hearted in time of danger, and willing
to weigh anchor and set sail for the isthmus of Corinth, near which
the land army lay encamped; which Themistocles resisted; and this
was the occasion of the well-known words, when Eurybiades, to check
his impatience, told him that at the Olympic games they that start
up before the rest are lashed; "And they," replied Themistocles, "that
are left behind are not crowned." Again, Eurybiades lifting up his
staff as if he were going to strike, Themistocles said, "Strike if
you will, but hear;" Eurybiades, wondering much at his moderation,
desired him to speak, and Themistocles now brought him to a better
understanding. And when one who stood by him told him that it did
not become those who had neither city nor house to lose, to persuade
others to relinquish their habitations and forsake their countries,
Themistocles gave this reply: "We have indeed left our houses and
our walls, base fellow, not thinking it fit to become slaves for the
sake of things that have no life nor soul; and yet our city is the
greatest of all Greece, consisting of two hundred galleys, which are
here to defend you, if you please; but if you run away and betray
us, as you did once before, the Greeks shall soon hear news of the
Athenians possessing as fair a country, and as large and free a city,
as that they have lost." These expressions of Themistocles made Eurybiades
suspect that if he retreated the Athenians would fall off from him.
When one of Eretria began to oppose him, he said, "Have you anything
to say of war, that are like an inkfish? you have a sword, but no
heart." Some say that while Themistocles was thus speaking upon the
deck, an owl was seen flying to the right hand of the fleet, which
came and sate upon the top of the mast; and this happy omen so far
disposed the Greeks to follow his advice, that they presently prepared
to fight. Yet, when the enemy's fleet was arrived at the haven of
Phalerum, upon the coast of Attica, and with the number of their ships
concealed all the shore, and when they saw the king himself in person
come down with his land army to the seaside, with all his forces united,
then the good counsel of Themistocles was soon forgotten, and the
Peloponnesians cast their eyes again towards the isthmus, and took
it very ill if any one spoke against their returning home; and, resolving
to depart that night, the pilots had orders what course to steer.

Themistocles, in great distress that the Greeks should retire, and
lose the advantage of the narrow seas and strait passage, and slip
home every one to his own city, considered with himself, and contrived
that stratagem that was carried out by Sicinnus. This Sicinnus was
a Persian captive, but a great lover of Themistocles, and the attendant
of his children. Upon this occasion, he sent him privately to Xerxes,
commanding him to tell the king that Themistocles, the admiral of
the Athenians, having espoused his interest, wished to be the first
to inform him that the Greeks were ready to make their escape, and
that he counselled him to hinder their flight, to set upon them while
they were in this confusion and at a distance from their land army,
and hereby destroy all their forces by sea. Xerxes was very joyful
at this message, and received it as from one who wished him all that
was good, and immediately issued instructions to the commanders of
his ships, that they should instantly set out with two hundred galleys
to encompass all the islands, and enclose all the straits and passages,
that none of the Greeks might escape, and that they should afterwards
follow with the rest of their fleet at leisure. This being done, Aristides,
the son of Lysimachus, was the first man that perceived it, and went
to the tent of Themistocles, not out of any friendship, for he had
been formerly banished by his means, as has been related, but to inform
him how they were encompassed by their enemies. Themistocles, knowing
the generosity of Aristides, and much struck by his visit at that
time, imparted to him all that he had transacted by Sicinnus, and
entreated him that, as he would be more readily believed among the
Greeks, he would make use of his credit to help to induce them to
stay and fight their enemies in the narrow seas. Aristides applauded
Themistocles, and went to the other commanders and captains of the
galleys, and encouraged them to engage; yet they did not perfectly
assent to him, till a galley of Tenos, which deserted from the Persians,
of which Panaetius was commander, came in, while they were still doubting,
and confirmed the news that all the straits and passages were beset;
and then their rage and fury, as well as their necessity, provoked
them all to fight. 

As soon as it was day, Xerxes placed himself high up, to view his
fleet, and how it was set in order. Phanodemus says, he sat upon a
promontory above the temple of Hercules, where the coast of Attica
is separated from the island by a narrow channel; but Acestodorus
writes, that it was in the confines of Megara, upon those hills which
are called the Horns, where he sat in a chair of gold, with many secretaries
about him to write down all that was done in the fight. 

When Themistocles was about to sacrifice, close to the admiral's galley,
there were three prisoners brought to him, fine looking men, and richly
dressed in ornamented clothing and gold, said to be the children of
Artayctes and Sandauce, sister to Xerxes. As soon as the prophet Euphrantides
saw them, and observed that at the same time the fire blazed out from
the offerings with a more than ordinary flame, and a man sneezed on
the right, which was an intimation of a fortunate event, he took Themistocles
by the hand, and bade him consecrate the three young men for sacrifice,
and offer them up with prayers for victory to Bacchus the Devourer;
so should the Greeks not only save themselves, but also obtain victory.
Themistocles was much disturbed at this strange and terrible prophecy,
but the common people, who in any difficult crisis and great exigency
ever look for relief rather to strange and extravagant than to reasonable
means, calling upon Bacchus with one voice, led the captives to the
altar, and compelled the execution of the sacrifice as the prophet
had commanded. This is reported by Phanias the Lesbian, a philosopher
well read in history. 

The number of the enemy's ships the poet Aeschylus gives in his tragedy
called the Persians, as on his certain knowledge, in the following
words:- 

"Xerxes, I know, did into battle lead 
One thousand ships; of more than usual speed 
Seven and two hundred. So it is agreed." 

The Athenians had a hundred and eighty; in every ship eighteen men
fought upon the deck, four of whom were archers and the rest men at
arms. 

As Themistocles had fixed upon the most advantageous place, so, with
no less sagacity, he chose the best time of fighting; for he would
not run the prows of his galleys against the Persians, nor begin the
fight till the time of day was come, when there regularly blows in
a fresh breeze from the open sea, and brings in with it a strong swell
into the channel; which was no inconvenience to the Greek ships, which
were low-built, and little above the water, but did much to hurt the
Persians, which had high sterns and lofty decks, and were heavy and
cumbrous in their movements as it presented them broadside to the
quick charges of the Greeks, who kept their eyes upon the motions
of Themistocles, as their best example, and more particularly because,
opposed to his ship, Ariamenes, admiral to Xerxes, a brave man and
by far the best and worthiest of the king's brothers, was seen throwing
darts and shooting arrows from his huge galley, as from the walls
of a castle. Aminias the Decelean and Sosicles the Pedian, who sailed
in the same vessel, upon the ships meeting stem to stem, and transfixing
each the other with their brazen prows, so that they were fastened
together, when Ariamenes attempted to board theirs, ran at him with
their pikes, and thrust him into the sea; his body, as it floated
amongst other shipwrecks, was known to Artemisia, and carried to Xerxes.

It is reported that, in the middle of the fight, a great flame rose
into the air above the city of Eleusis, and that sounds and voices
were heard through all the Thriasian plain, as far as the sea, sounding
like a number of men accompanying and escorting the mystic Iacchus,
and that a mist seemed to form and rise from the place from whence
the sounds came, and, passing forward, fell upon the galleys. Others
believed that they saw apparitions, in the shape of armed men, reaching
out their hands from the island of Aegina before the Grecian galleys;
and supposed they were the Aeacidae, whom they had invoked to their
aid before the battle. The first man that took a ship was Lycomedes
the Athenian, captain of the galley, who cut down its ensign, and
dedicated it to Apollo the Laurel-crowned. And as the Persians fought
in a narrow arm of the sea, and could bring but part of their fleet
to fight and fell foul of one another, the Greeks thus equalled them
in strength, and fought with them till the evening forced them back,
and obtained, as says Simonides, that noble and famous victory, than
which neither amongst the Greeks nor barbarians was ever known more
glorious exploit on the seas; by the joint valour, indeed, and zeal
of all who fought, but by the wisdom and sagacity of Themistocles.

After this sea-fight, Xerxes, enraged at his ill-fortune, attempted,
by casting great heaps of earth and stones into the sea, to stop up
the channel and make a dam, upon which he might lead his land-forces
over into the island of Salamis. 

Themistocles, being desirous to try the opinion of Aristides, told
him that he proposed to set sail for the Hellespont, to break the
bridge of ships so as to shut up, he said, Asia a prisoner within
Europe; but Aristides, disliking the design, said: "We have hitherto
fought with an enemy who has regarded little else but his pleasure
and luxury; but if we shut him up within Greece, and drive him to
necessity, he that is master of such great forces will no longer sit
quietly with an umbrella of gold over his head, looking upon the fight
for his pleasure; but in such a strait will attempt all things; he
will be resolute, and appear himself in person upon all occasions,
he will soon correct his errors, and supply what he has formerly omitted
through remissness, and will be better advised in all things. Therefore,
it is noways our interest, Themistocles," he said, "to take away the
bridge that is already made, but rather to build another, if it were
possible, that he might make his retreat with the more expedition."
To which Themistocles answered: "If this be requisite, we must immediately
use all diligence, art, and industry, to rid ourselves of him as soon
as may be;" and to this purpose he found out among the captives one
of the King of Persia's eunuchs, named Arnaces, whom he sent to the
king, to inform him that the Greeks, being now victorious by sea,
had decreed to sail to the Hellespont, where the boats were fastened
together, and destroy the bridge; but that Themistocles, being concerned
for the king, revealed this to him, that he might hasten towards the
Asiatic seas, and pass over into his own dominions; and in the meantime
would cause delays and hinder the confederates from pursuing him.
Xerxes no sooner heard this, but, being very much terrified, he proceeded
to retreat out of Greece with all speed. The prudence of Themistocles
and Aristides in this was afterwards more fully understood at the
battle of Plataea, where Mardonius, with a very small fraction of
the forces of Xerxes, put the Greeks in danger of losing all.

Herodotus writes, that of all the cities of Greece, Aegina was held
to have performed the best service in the war; while all single men
yielded to Themistocles, though, out of envy, unwillingly; and when
they returned to the entrance of Peloponnesus, where the several commanders
delivered their suffrages at the altar, to determine who was most
worthy, every one gave the first vote for himself and the second for
Themistocles. The Lacedaemonians carried him with them to Sparta,
where, giving the rewards of valour to Eurybiades, and of wisdom and
conduct to Themistocles, they crowned him with olive, presented him
with the best chariot in the city, and sent three hundred young men
to accompany him to the confines of their country. And at the next
Olympic games, when Themistocles entered the course, the spectators
took no farther notice of those who were contesting the prizes, but
spent the whole day in looking upon him, showing him to the strangers,
admiring him, and applauding him by clapping their hands, and other
expressions of joy, so that he himself, much gratified, confessed
to his friends that he then reaped the fruit of all his labours for
the Greeks. 

He was, indeed, by nature, a great lover of honour, as is evident
from the anecdotes recorded of him. When chosen admiral by the Athenians,
he would not quite conclude any single matter of business, either
public or private, but deferred all till the day they were to set
sail, that, by despatching a great quantity of business all at once,
and having to meet a great variety of people, he might make an appearance
of greatness and power. Viewing the dead bodies cast up by the sea,
he perceived bracelets and necklaces of gold about them, yet passed
on, only showing them to a friend that followed him, saying, "Take
you these things, for you are not Themistocles." He said to Antiphates,
a handsome young man, who had formerly avoided, but now in his glory
courted him, "Time, young man, has taught us both a lesson." He said
that the Athenians did not honour him or admire him, but made, as
it were, a sort of plane-tree of him; sheltered themselves under him
in bad weather, and as soon as it was fine, plucked his leaves and
cut his branches. When the Seriphian told him that he had not obtained
this honour by himself, but by the greatness of the city, he replied,
"You speak truth; I should never have been famous if I had been of
Seriphus; nor you, had you been of Athens." When another of the generals,
who thought he had performed considerable service for the Athenians,
boastingly compared his action with those of Themistocles, he told
him that once upon a time the Day after the Festival found fault with
the Festival: "On you there is nothing but hurry and trouble and preparation,
but, when I come, everybody sits down quietly and enjoys himself;"
which the Festival admitted was true, but "if I had not come first,
you would not have come at all." "Even so," he said, "if Themistocles
had not come before, where had you been now?" Laughing at his own
son, who got his mother, and, by his mother's means, his father also,
to indulge him, he told him that he had the most power of any one
in Greece: "For the Athenians command the rest of Greece, I command
the Athenians, your mother commands me, and you command your mother."
Loving to be singular in all things, when he had land to sell, he
ordered the crier to give notice that there were good neighbours near
it. Of two who made love to his daughter, he preferred the man of
worth to the one who was rich, saying he desired a man without riches,
rather than riches without a man. Such was the character of his sayings.

After these things, he began to rebuild and fortify the city of Athens,
bribing, as Theopompus reports, the Lacedaemonian ephors not to be
against it, but, as most relate it, overreaching and deceiving them.
For, under the pretext of an embassy, he went to Sparta, whereupon
the Lacedaemonians' charging him with rebuilding the walls, and Poliarchus
coming on purpose from Aegina to denounce it, he denied the fact,
bidding them to send people to Athens to see whether it were so or
no; by which delay he got time for the building of the wall, and also
placed these ambassadors in the hands of his countrymen as hostages
for him; and so, when the Lacedaemonians knew the truth, they did
him no hurt, but, suppressing all display of their anger for the present,
sent him away. 

Next he proceeded to establish the harbour of Piraeus, observing the
great natural advantages of the locality, and desirous to unite the
whole city with the sea, and to reverse, in a manner, the policy of
ancient Athenian kings, who, endeavouring to withdraw their subjects
from the sea, and to accustom them to live, not by sailing about,
but by planting and tilling the earth, spread the story of the dispute
between Minerva and Neptune for the sovereignty of Athens, in which
Minerva, by producing to the judges an olive-tree, was declared to
have won; whereas Themistocles did not only knead up, as Aristophanes
says, the port and the city into one, but made the city absolutely
the dependant and the adjunct of the port, and the land of the sea,
which increased the power and confidence of the people against the
nobility; the authority coming into the hands of sailors and boatswains
and pilots. Thus it was one of the orders of the thirty tyrants, that
the hustings in the assembly, which had faced towards the sea, should
be turned round towards the land; implying their opinion that the
empire by sea had been the origin of the democracy, and that the farming
population were not so much opposed to oligarchy. 

Themistocles, however, formed yet higher designs with a view to naval
supremacy. For, after the departure of Xerxes, when the Grecian fleet
was arrived at Pagasae, where they wintered, Themistocles, in a public
oration to the people of Athens, told them that he had a design to
perform something that would tend greatly to their interests and safety,
but was of such a nature that it could not be made generally public.
The Athenians ordered him to impart it to Aristides only; and, if
he approved of it, to put it in practice. And when Themistocles had
discovered to him that his design was to burn the Grecian fleet in
the haven of Pagasae, Aristides coming out to the people, gave this
report of the stratagem contrived by Themistocles, that no proposal
could be more politic, or more dishonourable; on which the Athenians
commanded Themistocles to think no farther of it. 

When the Lacedaemonians proposed, at the general council of the Amphictyonians,
that the representatives of those cities which were not in the league,
nor had fought against the Persians, should be excluded, Themistocles,
fearing that the Thessalians, with those of Thebes, Argos, and others,
being thrown out of the council, the Lacedaemonians would become wholly
masters of the votes, and do what they pleased, supported the deputies
of the cities, and prevailed with the members then sitting to alter
their opinion on this point, showing them that there were but one-and-thirty
cities which had partaken in the war, and that most of these, also,
were very small; how intolerable would it be, if the rest of Greece
should be excluded, and the general council should come to be ruled
by two or three great cities. By this, chiefly, he incurred the displeasure
of the Lacedaemonians, whose honours and favours were now shown to
Cimon, with a view to making him the opponent of the state policy
of Themistocles. 

He was also burdensome to the confederates, sailing about the islands
and collecting money from them. Herodotus says, that, requiring money
of those of the island of Andros, he told them that he had brought
with him two goddesses, Persuasion and Force; and they answered him
that they had also two great goddesses, which prohibited them from
giving him any money, Poverty and Impossibility. Timocreon, the Rhodian
poet, reprehends him somewhat bitterly for being wrought upon by money
to let some who were banished return, while abandoning himself, who
was his guest and friend. The verses are these:- 

"Pausanias you may praise, and Xanthippus, he be for, 
For Leutychidas, a third; Aristides, I proclaim, 
From the sacred Athens came. 
The one true man of all; for Themistocles Latona doth abhor,

The liar, traitor, cheat, who to gain his filthy pay, 
Timocreon, his friend, neglected to restore 
To his native Rhodian shore; 
Three silver talents took and departed (curses with him) on his

way, 
Restoring people here, expelling there, and killing here,

Filling evermore his purse: and at the Isthmus gave a treat,

To be laughed at, of cold meat, 
Which they ate, and prayed the gods some one else might 
give the feast another year." But after the sentence and banishment
of Themistocles, Timocreon reviles him yet more immoderately and wildly
in a poem that begins thus:- 

"Unto all the Greeks repair, 
O Muse, and tell these verses there, 
As is fitting and is fair." The story is, that it was put to the question
whether Timocreon should be banished for siding with the Persians,
and Themistocles gave his vote against him. So when Themistocles was
accused of intriguing with the Medes, Timocreon made these lines upon
him:- 

"So now Timocreon, indeed, is not the sole friend of the Mede,

There are some knaves besides; nor is it only mine that fails,

But other foxes have lost tails.-" When the citizens of Athens began
to listen willingly to those who traduced and reproached him, he was
forced, with somewhat obnoxious frequency, to put them in mind of
the great services he had performed, and ask those who were offended
with him whether they were weary with receiving benefits often from
the same person, so rendering himself more odious. And he yet more
provoked the people by building a temple to Diana with the epithet
of Aristobule, or Diana of Best Counsel; intimating thereby, that
he had given the best counsel, not only to the Athenians, but to all
Greece. He built this temple near his own house, in the district called
Melite, where now the public officers carry out the bodies of such
as are executed, and throw the halters and clothes of those that are
strangled or otherwise put to death. There is to this day a small
figure of Themistocles in the temple of Diana of Best Counsel, which
represents him to be a person not only of a noble mind, but also of
a most heroic aspect. At length the Athenians banished him, making
use of the ostracism to humble his eminence and authority, as they
ordinarily did with all whom they thought too powerful, or, by their
greatness, disproportional to the equality thought requisite in a
popular government. For the ostracism was instituted, not so much
to punish the offender, as to mitigate and pacify the violence of
the envious, who delighted to humble eminent men, and who, by fixing
this disgrace upon them, might vent some part of their rancour.

Themistocles being banished from Athens, while he stayed at Argos
the detection of Pausanias happened, which gave such advantage to
his enemies, that Leobotes of Agraule, son of Alcmaeon, indicted him
of treason, the Spartans supporting him in the accusation.

When Pausanias went about this treasonable design, he concealed it
at first from Themistocles, though he were his intimate friend; but
when he saw him expelled out of the commonwealth, and how impatiently
he took his banishment, he ventured to communicate it to him, and
desired his assistance, showing him the king of Persia's letters,
and exasperating him against the Greeks, as a villainous, ungrateful
people. However, Themistocles immediately rejected the proposals of
Pausanias, and wholly refused to be a party in the enterprise, though
he never revealed his communications, nor disclosed the conspiracy
to any man, either hoping that Pausanias would desist from his intentions,
or expecting that so inconsiderate an attempt after such chimerical
objects would be discovered by other means. 

After that Pausanias was put to death, letters and writings being
found concerning this matter, which rendered Themistocles suspected,
the Lacedaemonians were clamorous against him, and his enemies among
the Athenians accused him; when, being absent from Athens, he made
his defence by letters, especially against the points that had been
previously alleged against him. In answer to the malicious detractions
of his enemies, he merely wrote to the citizens, urging that he who
was always ambitious to govern, and not of a character or a disposition
to serve, would never sell himself and his country into slavery to
a barbarous and hostile nation. 

Notwithstanding this, the people, being persuaded by his accusers,
sent officers to take him and bring him away to be tried before a
council of the Greeks, but, having timely notice of it, he passed
over into the island of Corcyra, where the state was under obligations
to him; for, being chosen as arbitrator in a difference between them
and the Corinthians, he decided the controversy by ordering the Corinthians
to pay down twenty talents, and declaring the town and island of Leucas
a joint colony from both cities. From thence he fled into Epirus,
and, the Athenians and Lacedaemonians still pursuing him, he threw
himself upon chances of safety that seemed all but desperate. For
he fled for refuge to Admetus, king of the Molossians, who had formerly
made some request to the Athenians, when Themistocles was in the height
of his authority, and had been disdainfully used and insulted by him,
and had let it appear plain enough, that, could he lay hold of him,
he would take his revenge. Yet in this misfortune Themistocles, fearing
the recent hatred of his neighbours and fellow-citizens more than
the old displeasure of the king, put himself at his mercy and became
an humble suppliant to Admetus, after a peculiar manner different
from the custom of other countries. For taking the king's son, who
was then a child, in his arms, he laid himself down at his hearth,
this being the most sacred and only manner of supplication among the
Molossians, which was not to be refused. And some say that his wife,
Phthia, intimated to Themistocles this way of petitioning, and placed
her young son with him before the hearth; others, that king Admetus,
that he might be under a religious obligation not to deliver him up
to his pursuers, prepared and enacted with him a sort of stage-play
to this effect. At this time Epicrates of Acharnae privately conveyed
his wife and children out of Athens, and sent them hither, for which
afterwards Cimon condemned him and put him to death; as Stesimbrotus
reports, and yet somehow, either forgetting this himself, or making
Themistocles to be little mindful of it, says presently that he sailed
into Sicily, and desired in marriage the daughter of Hiero, tyrant
of Syracuse, promising to bring the Greeks under his power; and, on
Hiero refusing him, departed thence into Asia; but this is not probable.

For Theophrastus writes, in his work on Monarchy, that when Hiero
sent race-horses to the Olympian games, and erected a pavilion sumptuously
furnished, Themistocles made an oration to the Greeks, inciting them
to pull down the tyrant's tent, and not to suffer his horses to run.
Thucydides says, that, passing overland to the Aegaean Sea, he took
ship at Pydna in the bay Therme, not being known to any one in the
ship, till, being terrified to see the vessel driven by the winds
near to Naxos, which was then besieged by the Athenians, he made himself
known to the master and pilot, and partly entreating them, partly
threatening that if they went on shore he would accuse them, and make
the Athenians to believe that they did not take him in out of ignorance,
but that he had corrupted them with money from the beginning, he compelled
them to bear off and stand out to sea, and sail forward towards the
coast of Asia. 

A great part of his estate was privately conveyed away by his friends,
and sent after him by sea into Asia; besides which, there was discovered
and confiscated to the value of fourscore talents, as Theophrastus
writes; Theopompus says an hundred; though Themistocles was never
worth three talents before he was concerned in public affairs.

When he arrived at Cyme, and understood that all along the coast there
were many laid wait for him, and particularly Ergoteles and Pythodorus
(for the game was worth the hunting for such as were thankful to make
money by any means, the king of Persia having offered by public proclamation
two hundred talents to him that should take him), he fled to Aegae,
a small city of the Aeolians, where no one knew him but only his host
Nicogenes, who was the richest man in Aeolia, and well known to the
great men of Inner Asia. While Themistocles lay bid for some days
in his house, one night, after a sacrifice and supper ensuing, Olbius,
the attendant upon Nicogenes's children, fell into a sort of frenzy
and fit of inspiration, and cried out in verse- 

"Night shall speak, and night instruct thee, 
By the voice of night conduct thee." After this, Themistocles, going
to bed, dreamed that he saw a snake coil itself up upon his belly,
and so creep to his neck; then, as soon as it touched his face, it
turned into an eagle, which spread its wings over him, and took him
up and flew away with him a great distance; then there appeared a
herald's golden wand, and upon this at last it set him down securely,
after infinite terror and disturbance. 

His departure was effected by Nicogenes by the following artifice:
The barbarous nations, and amongst them the Persians especially, are
extremely jealous, severe, and suspicious about their women, not only
their wives, but also their bought slaves and concubines, whom they
keep so strictly that no one ever sees them abroad; they spend their
lives shut up within doors, and, when they take a journey, are carried
in close tents, curtained in on all sides, and set upon a wagon. Such
a travelling carriage being prepared for Themistocles, they hid him
in it, and carried him on his journey, and told those whom they met
or spoke with upon the road that they were conveying a young Greek
woman out of Ionia to a nobleman at court. 

Thucydides and Charon of Lampsacus say that Xerxes was dead, and that
Themistocles had an interview with his son; but Ephorus, Dinon, Clitarchus,
Heraclides, and many others, write that he came to Xerxes. The chronological
tables better agree with the account of Thucydides, and yet neither
can their statements be said to be quite set at rest. 

When Themistocles was come to the critical point, he applied himself
first to Artabanus, commander of a thousand men, telling him that
he was a Greek, and desired to speak with the king about important
affairs concerning which the king was extremely solicitous. Artabanus
answered him: "O stranger, the laws of men are different, and one
thing is honourable to one man, and to others another; but it is honourable
for all to honour and observe their own laws. It is the habit of the
Greeks, we are told, to honour, above all things, liberty and equality;
but amongst our many excellent laws, we account this the most excellent,
to honour the king, and to worship him, as the image of the great
preserver of the universe; if, then, you shall consent to our laws,
and fall down before the king and worship him, you may both see him
and speak to him; but if your mind be otherwise, you must make use
of others to intercede for you, for it is not the national custom
here for the king to give audience to any one that doth not fall down
before him." Themistocles, hearing this, replied: "Artabanus, I, that
come hither to increase the power and glory of the king, will not
only submit myself to his laws, since so it hath pleased the god who
exalteth the Persian empire to this greatness, but will also cause
many more to be worshippers and adorers of the king. Let not this,
therefore, be an impediment why I should not communicate to the king
what I have to impart." Artabanus asking him, "Who must we tell him
that you are? for your words signify you to be no ordinary person."
Themistocles answered, "No man, O Artabanus, must be informed of this
before the king himself." Thus Phanias relates; to which Eratosthenes,
in his treatise on Riches, adds, that it was by the means of a woman
of Eretria, who was kept by Artabanus, that he obtained this audience
and interview with him. 

When he was introduced to the king, and had paid his reverence to
him, he stood silent, till the king commanding the interpreter to
ask him who he was, he replied, "O king, I am Themistocles the Athenian,
driven into banishment by the Greeks. The evils that I have done to
the Persians are numerous; but my benefits to them yet greater, in
withholding the Greeks from pursuit, so soon as the deliverance of
my own country allowed me to show kindness also to you. I come with
a mind suited to my present calamities; prepared alike for favours
and for anger; to welcome your gracious reconciliation, and to deprecate
your wrath. Take my own countrymen for witnesses of the services I
have done for Persia, and make use of this occasion to show the world
your virtue, rather than to satisfy your indignation. If you save
me, you will save your suppliant; if otherwise, will destroy an enemy
of the Greeks." He talked also of divine admonitions, such as the
vision which he saw at Nicogenes's house, and the direction given
him by the oracle of Dodona, where Jupiter commanded him to go to
him that had a name like his, by which he understood that he was sent
from Jupiter to him, seeing that they both were great, and had the
name of kings. 

The king heard him attentively, and, though he admired his temper
and courage, gave him no answer at that time; but, when he was with
his intimate friends, rejoiced in his great good fortune, and esteemed
himself very happy in this, and prayed to his god Arimanius, that
all his enemies might be ever of the same mind with the Greeks, to
abuse and expel the bravest men amongst them. Then he sacrificed to
the gods, and presently fell to drinking, and was so well pleased,
that in the night, in the middle of his sleep, he cried out for joy
three times, "I have Themistocles the Athenian." 

In the morning, calling together the chief of his court, he had Themistocles
brought before him, who expected no good of it, when he saw, for example,
the guards fiercely set against him as soon as they learnt his name,
and giving him ill language. As he came forward towards the king,
who was seated, the rest keeping silence, passing by Roxanes, a commander
of a thousand men, he heard him, with a slight groan, say, without
stirring out of his place, "You subtle Greek serpent, the king's good
genius hath brought thee thither." Yet, when he came into the presence,
and again fell down, the king saluted him, and spake to him kindly,
telling him he was now indebted to him two hundred talents; for it
was just and reasonable that he should receive the reward which was
proposed to whosoever should bring Themistocles; and promising much
more, and encouraging him, he commanded him to speak freely what he
would concerning the affairs of Greece. Themistocles replied, that
a man's discourse was like to a rich Persian carpet, the beautiful
figures and patterns of which can only be shown by spreading and extending
it out; when it is contracted and folded up, they are obscure and
lost; and, therefore, he desired time. The king being pleased with
the comparison, and bidding him take what time he would, he desired
a year; in which time, having learnt the Persian language sufficiently,
he spoke with the king by himself without the help of an interpreter,
it being supposed that he discoursed only about the affairs of Greece;
but there happening, at the same time, great alterations at court,
and removals of the king's favourites, he drew upon himself the envy
of the great people, who imagined that he had taken the boldness to
speak concerning them. For the favours shown to other strangers were
nothing in comparison with the honours conferred on him; the king
invited him to partake of his own pastimes and recreations both at
home and abroad, carrying him with him a-hunting, and made him his
intimate so far that he permitted him to see the queen-mother, and
converse frequently with her. By the king's command, he also was made
acquainted with the Magian learning. 

When Demaratus the Lacedaemonian, being ordered by the king to ask
whatsoever he pleased, that it should immediately be granted him,
desired that he might make his public entrance, and be carried in
state through the city of Sardis, with the tiara set in the royal
manner upon his head, Mithropaustes, cousin to the king, touched him
on the head, and told him that he had no brains for the royal tiara
to cover, and if Jupiter should give him his lightning and thunder,
he would not any the more be Jupiter for that; the king also repulsed
him with anger, resolving never to be reconciled to him, but to be
inexorable to all supplications on his behalf. Yet Themistocles pacified
him, and prevailed with him to forgive him. And it is reported that
the succeeding kings, in whose reigns there was a greater communication
between the Greeks and Persians, when they invited any considerable
Greek into their service, to encourage him, would write, and promise
him that he should be as great with them as Themistocles had been.
They relate, also, how Themistocles, when he was in great prosperity,
and courted by many, seeing himself splendidly served at his table,
turned to his children and said, "Children, we had been undone if
we had not been undone." Most writers say that he had three cities
given him, Magnesia, Myus, and Lampsacus, to maintain him in bread,
meat, and wine. Neanthes of Cyzicus, and Phanias, add two more, the
city of Palaescepsis, to provide him with clothes, and Percote, with
bedding and furniture for his house. 

As he was going down towards the sea-coast to take measures against
Greece, a Persian whose name was Epixyes, governor of the upper Phrygia,
laid wait to kill him, having for that purpose provided a long time
before a number of Pisidians, who were to set upon him when he should
stop to rest at a city that is called Lion's-head. But Themistocles,
sleeping in the middle of the day, saw the Mother of the gods appear
to him in a dream and say unto him, "Themistocles, keep back from
the Lion's-head, for fear you fall into the lion's jaws; for this
advice I expect that your daughter Mnesiptolema should be my servant."
Themistocles was much astonished, and when he had made his vows to
the goddess, left the broad road, and, making a circuit, went another
way, changing his intended station to avoid that place, and at night
took up his rest in the fields. But one of the sumpter-horses, which
carried the furniture for his tent, having fallen that day into the
river, his servants spread out the tapestry, which was wet, and hung
it up to dry; in the meantime the Pisidians made towards them with
their swords drawn, and, not discerning exactly by the moon what it
was that was stretched out, thought it to be the tent of Themistocles,
and that they should find him resting himself within it; but when
they came near, and lifted up the hangings, those who watched there
fell upon them and took them. Themistocles, having escaped this great
danger, in admiration of the goodness of the goddess that appeared
to him, built, in memory of it, a temple in the city of Magnesia,
which is dedicated to Dindymene, Mother of the gods, in which he consecrated
and devoted his daughter Mnesiptolema to her service. 

When he came to Sardis, he visited the temples of the gods, and observing,
at his leisure, their buildings, ornaments, and the number of their
offerings, he saw in the temple of the Mother of the gods the statue
of a virgin in brass, two cubits high, called the water-bringer. Themistocles
had caused this to be made and set up when he was surveyor of the
waters at Athens out of the fines of those whom he detected in drawing
off and diverting the public water by pipes for their private use;
and whether he had some regret to see this image in captivity, or
was desirous to let the Athenians see in what great credit and authority
he was with the king, he entered into a treaty with the governor to
persuade him to send this statue back to Athens, which so enraged
the Persian officer, that he told him he would write the king word
of it. Themistocles, being affrighted hereat, got access to his wives
and concubines, by presents of money to whom he appeased the fury
of the governor; and afterwards behaved with more reserve and circumspection,
fearing the envy of the Persians, and did not, as Theopompus writes,
continue to travel about Asia, but lived quietly in his own house
in Magnesia, where for a long time he passed his days in great security,
being courted by all, and enjoying rich presents, and honoured equally
with the greatest persons in the Persian empire; the king, at that
time, not minding his concerns with Greece, being taken up with the
affairs of inner Asia. 

But when Egypt revolted, being assisted by the Athenians, and the
Greek galleys roved about as far as Cyprus and Cilicia, and Cimon
had made himself master of the seas, the king turned his thoughts
thither, and, bending his mind chiefly to resist the Greeks, and to
check the growth of their power against him, began to raise forces,
and send out commanders, and to despatch messengers to Themistocles
at Magnesia, to put him in mind of his promise, and to summon him
to act against the Greeks. Yet this did not increase his hatred nor
exasperate him against the Athenians, neither was he in any way elevated
with the thoughts of the honour and powerful command he was to have
in this war; but judging, perhaps, that the object would not be attained,
the Greeks having at that time, beside other great commanders, Cimon,
in particular, who was gaining wonderful military successes; but chiefly
being ashamed to sully the glory of his former great actions, and
of his many victories and trophies, he determined to put a conclusion
to his life, agreeable to its previous course. He sacrificed to the
gods, and invited his friends; and, having entertained them and shaken
hands with them, drank bull's blood, as is the usual story; as others
state, a poison producing instant death; and ended his days in the
city of Magnesia, having lived sixty-five years, most of which he
had spent in politics and in wars, in government and command. The
king being informed of the cause and manner of his death, admired
him more than ever, and continued to show kindness to his friends
and relations. 

Themistocles left three sons by Archippe, daughter to Lysander of
Alopece,- Archeptolis, Poleuctus, and Cleophantus. Plato, the philosopher,
mentions the last as a most excellent horseman, but otherwise insignificant
person; of two sons yet older than these, Neocles and Diocles, Neocles
died when he was young by the bite of a horse, and Diocles was adopted
by his grandfather, Lysander. He had many daughters, of whom Mnesiptolema,
whom he had by a second marriage, was wife to Archeptolis, her brother
by another mother; Italia was married to Panthoides, of the island
of Chios; Sybaris to Nicomedes the Athenian. After the death of Themistocles,
his nephew, Phrasicles, went to Magnesia, and married, with her brothers'
consent, another daughter, Nicomache, and took charge of her sister
Asia, the youngest of all the children. 

The Magnesians possess a splendid sepulchre of Themistocles, placed
in the middle of their market-place. It is not worth while taking
notice of what Andocides states in his address to his Friends concerning
his remains, how the Athenian robbed his tomb, and threw his ashes
into the air; for he feigns this, to exasperate the oligarchical faction
against the people; and there is no man living but knows that Phylarchus
simply invents in his history, where he all but uses an actual stage
machine, and brings in Neocles and Demopolis as the sons of Themistocles,
to incite or move compassion, as if he were writing a tragedy. Diodorus
the cosmographer says, in his work on Tombs, but by conjecture rather
than of certain knowledge, that near to the haven of Piraeus where
the land runs out like an elbow from the promontory of Alcimus, when
you have doubled the cape and passed inward where the sea is always
calm, there is a large piece of masonry, and upon this the Tomb of
Themistocles, in the shape of an altar; and Plato the comedian confirms
this, he believes, in these verses:- 

"Thy tomb is fairly placed upon the strand, 
Where merchants still shall greet it with the land; 
Still in and out 'twill see them come and go, 
And watch the galleys as they race below." 

Various honours also and privileges were granted to the kindred of
Themistocles at Magnesia, which were observed down to our times, and
were enjoyed by another Themistocles of Athens, with whom I had an
intimate acquaintance and friendship in the house of Ammonius the
philosopher.
