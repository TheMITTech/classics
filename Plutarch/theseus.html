<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>As geographers, Sosius, crowd into the edges of their maps parts of the 
<A NAME="11"></A>world which they do not know about, adding notes in the margin to the effect, 
<A NAME="12"></A>that beyond this lies nothing but the sandy deserts full of wild beasts, 
<A NAME="13"></A>unapproachable bogs, Scythian ice, or a frozen sea, so in this work of 
<A NAME="14"></A>mine, in which I have compared the lives of the greatest men with one another, 
<A NAME="15"></A>after passing through those periods which probable reasoning can reach 
<A NAME="16"></A>to and real history find a footing in, I might very well say of those that 
<A NAME="17"></A>are farther off: "Beyond this there is nothing but prodigies and fictions, 
<A NAME="18"></A>the only inhabitants are the poets and inventors of fables; there is no 
<A NAME="19"></A>credit, or certainty any farther." Yet, after publishing an account of 
<A NAME="20"></A>Lycurgus the lawgiver and Numa the king, I thought I might, not without 
<A NAME="21"></A>reason, ascend as high as to Romulus, being brought by my history so near 
<A NAME="22"></A>to his time. Considering therefore with myself-
<A NAME="23"></A><BR><BR>"Whom shall I set so great a man to face?
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>Or whom oppose? Who's equal to the place?" (as Aeschylus expresses 
<A NAME="25"></A>it), I found none so fit as him that peopled the beautiful and far-famed 
<A NAME="26"></A>city of Athens, to be set in opposition with the father of the invincible 
<A NAME="27"></A>and renowned city of Rome. Let us hope that Fable may, in what shall follow, 
<A NAME="28"></A>so submit to the purifying processes of Reason as to take the character 
<A NAME="29"></A>of exact history. In any case, however, where it shall be found contumaciously 
<A NAME="30"></A>slighting credibility and refusing to be reduced to anything like probable 
<A NAME="31"></A>fact, we shall beg that we may meet with candid readers, and such as will 
<A NAME="32"></A>receive with indulgence the stories of antiquity.
<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR>Theseus seemed to me to resemble Romulus in many particulars. Both 
<A NAME="34"></A>of them, born out of wedlock and of uncertain parentage, had the repute 
<A NAME="35"></A>of being sprung from the gods.
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR>"Both warriors; that by all the world's allowed." Both of them 
<A NAME="37"></A>united with strength of body an equal vigour of mind; and of the two most 
<A NAME="38"></A>famous cities of the world, the one built Rome, and the other made Athens 
<A NAME="39"></A>be inhabited. Both stand charged with the rape of women; neither of them 
<A NAME="40"></A>could avoid domestic misfortunes nor jealousy at home; but towards the 
<A NAME="41"></A>close of their lives are both of them said to have incurred great odium 
<A NAME="42"></A>with their countrymen, if, that is, we may take the stories least like 
<A NAME="43"></A>poetry as our guide to the truth.
<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR>The lineage of Theseus, by his father's side, ascends as high as 
<A NAME="45"></A>to Erectheus and the first inhabitants of Attica. By his mother's side 
<A NAME="46"></A>he was descended of Pelops. For Pelops was the most powerful of all the 
<A NAME="47"></A>kings of Peloponnesus, not so much by the greatness of his riches as the 
<A NAME="48"></A>multitude of his children, having married many daughters to chief men, 
<A NAME="49"></A>and put many sons in places of command in the towns round about him. One 
<A NAME="50"></A>of whom named Pittheus, grandfather to Theseus, was governor of the small 
<A NAME="51"></A>city of the Troezenians and had the repute of a man of the greatest knowledge 
<A NAME="52"></A>and wisdom of his time; which then, it seems, consisted chiefly in grave 
<A NAME="53"></A>maxims, such as the poet Hesiod got his great fame by, in his book of Works 
<A NAME="54"></A>and Days. And, indeed, among these is one that they ascribe to 
<A NAME="55"></A>Pittheus,-
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR>"Unto a friend suffice
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>A stipulated price;" which, also, Aristotle mentions. And Euripides, 
<A NAME="58"></A>by calling Hippolytus "scholar of the holy Pittheus," shows the opinion 
<A NAME="59"></A>that the world had of him. Aegeus, being desirous of children, and consulting 
<A NAME="60"></A>the oracle of Delphi, received the celebrated answer which forbade him 
<A NAME="61"></A>the company of any woman before his return to Athens. But the oracle being 
<A NAME="62"></A>so obscure as not to satisfy him that he was clearly forbid this, he went 
<A NAME="63"></A>to Troezen, and communicated to Pittheus the voice of the god, which was 
<A NAME="64"></A>in this manner,-
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR>"Loose not the wine-skin foot, thou chief of 
<A NAME="66"></A>men,
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>Until to Athens thou art come again."
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR>Pittheus, therefore, taking advantage from the obscurity of the 
<A NAME="69"></A>oracle, prevailed upon him, it is uncertain whether by persuasion or deceit, 
<A NAME="70"></A>to lie with his daughter Aethra. Aegeus afterwards, knowing her whom he 
<A NAME="71"></A>had lain with to be Pittheus's daughter, and suspecting her to be with 
<A NAME="72"></A>child by him, left a sword and a pair of shoes, hiding them under a great 
<A NAME="73"></A>stone that had a hollow in it exactly fitting them; and went away making 
<A NAME="74"></A>her only privy to it, and commanding her, if she brought forth a son who, 
<A NAME="75"></A>when he came to man's estate, should be able to lift up the stone and take 
<A NAME="76"></A>away what he had left there, she should send him way to him with those 
<A NAME="77"></A>things with all secrecy, and with injunctions to him as much as possible 
<A NAME="78"></A>to conceal his journey from every one; for he greatly feared the Pallantidae, 
<A NAME="79"></A>who were continually mutinying against him, and despised him for his want 
<A NAME="80"></A>of children, they themselves being fifty brothers, all sons of 
<A NAME="81"></A>Pallas.
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR>When Aethra was delivered of a son, some say that he was immediately 
<A NAME="83"></A>named Theseus, from the tokens which his father had put under the stone; 
<A NAME="84"></A>others that he had received his name afterwards at Athens, when Aegeus 
<A NAME="85"></A>acknowledged him for his son. He was brought up under his grandfather Pittheus, 
<A NAME="86"></A>and had a tutor and attendant set over him named Connidas, to whom the 
<A NAME="87"></A>Athenians even to this time, the day before the feast that is dedicated 
<A NAME="88"></A>to Theseus, sacrifice a ram, giving this honour to his memory upon much 
<A NAME="89"></A>juster grounds than to Silanio and Parrhasius for making, pictures and 
<A NAME="90"></A>statues of Theseus. There being then a custom for the Grecian youth, upon 
<A NAME="91"></A>their first coming to man's estate, to go to Delphi and offer first-fruits 
<A NAME="92"></A>of their hair to the god, Theseus also went thither, and a place there 
<A NAME="93"></A>to this day is yet named Thesea, as it is said, from him. He clipped only 
<A NAME="94"></A>the fore part of his head, as Homer says the Abantes did. And this sort 
<A NAME="95"></A>of tonsure was from him named Theseus. The Abantes first used it, not in 
<A NAME="96"></A>imitation of the Arabians, as some imagine, nor of the Mysians, but because 
<A NAME="97"></A>they were a warlike people, and used to close fighting, and above all other 
<A NAME="98"></A>nations accustomed to engage hand to hand; as Archilochus testifies in 
<A NAME="99"></A>these verses:-
<A NAME="100"></A><BR><BR>"Slings shall not whirl, nor many arrows fly,
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>When on the plain the battle joins; but swords,
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>Man against man, the deadly conflict try
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>As is the practice of Euboea's lords
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>Skilled with the spear.-"
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR>Therefore that they might not give their enemies a hold by their 
<A NAME="106"></A>hair, they cut it in this manner. They write also that this was the reason 
<A NAME="107"></A>why Alexander gave command to his captains that all the beards of the Macedonians 
<A NAME="108"></A>should be shaved, as being the readiest hold for an 
<A NAME="109"></A>enemy.
<A NAME="110"></A><BR><BR>Aethra for some time concealed the true parentage of Theseus, and 
<A NAME="111"></A>a report was given out by Pittheus that he was begotten by Neptune; for 
<A NAME="112"></A>the Troezenians pay Neptune the highest veneration. He is their tutelar 
<A NAME="113"></A>god; to him they offer all their first-fruits, and in his honour stamp 
<A NAME="114"></A>their money with a trident.
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR>Theseus displaying not only great strength of body, but equal bravery, 
<A NAME="116"></A>and a quickness alike and force of understanding, his mother Aethra conducting 
<A NAME="117"></A>him to the stone, and informing him who was his true father, commanded 
<A NAME="118"></A>him to take from thence the tokens that Aegeus had left, and sail to Athens. 
<A NAME="119"></A>He without any difficulty set himself to the stone and lifted it up; but 
<A NAME="120"></A>refused to take his journey by sea, though it was much the safer way, and 
<A NAME="121"></A>though his mother and grandfather begged him to do so. For it was at that 
<A NAME="122"></A>time very dangerous to go by land on the road to Athens, no part of it 
<A NAME="123"></A>being free from robbers and murderers. That age produced a sort of men, 
<A NAME="124"></A>in force of hand, and swiftness of foot, and strength of body, excelling 
<A NAME="125"></A>the ordinary rate and wholly incapable of fatigue; making use, however, 
<A NAME="126"></A>of these gifts of nature to no good or profitable purpose for mankind, 
<A NAME="127"></A>but rejoicing and priding themselves in insolence, and taking the benefit 
<A NAME="128"></A>of their superior strength in the exercise of inhumanity and cruelty, and 
<A NAME="129"></A>in seizing, forcing, and committing all manner of outrages upon everything 
<A NAME="130"></A>that fell into their hands; all respect for others, all justice, they thought, 
<A NAME="131"></A>all equity and humanity, though naturally lauded by common people, either 
<A NAME="132"></A>out of want of courage to commit injuries or fear to receive them, yet 
<A NAME="133"></A>no way concerned those who were strong enough to win for themselves. Some 
<A NAME="134"></A>of these, Hercules destroyed and cut off in his passage through these countries; 
<A NAME="135"></A>but some escaping his notice while he was passing by, fled and hid themselves, 
<A NAME="136"></A>or else were spared by him in contempt of their abject submission: and 
<A NAME="137"></A>after that Hercules fell into misfortune, and, having slain Iphitus, retired 
<A NAME="138"></A>to Lydia, and for a long time was there slave to Omphale, a punishment 
<A NAME="139"></A>which he had imposed upon himself for the murder: then, indeed, Lydia enjoyed 
<A NAME="140"></A>high peace and security, but in Greece and the countries about it the like 
<A NAME="141"></A>villainies again revived and broke out, there being none to repress or 
<A NAME="142"></A>chastise them. It was therefore a very hazardous journey to travel by land 
<A NAME="143"></A>from Athens to Peloponnesus; and Pittheus giving him an exact account of 
<A NAME="144"></A>each of the robbers and villains, their strength, and the cruelty they 
<A NAME="145"></A>used to all strangers, tried to persuade Theseus to go by sea. But he, 
<A NAME="146"></A>it seems, had long since been secretly fired by the glory of Hercules, 
<A NAME="147"></A>held him in the highest estimation, and was never more satisfied than in 
<A NAME="148"></A>listening to any that gave an account of him; especially those that had 
<A NAME="149"></A>seen him or had been present at any action or saying of his. So that he 
<A NAME="150"></A>was altogether in the same state of feeling as, in after ages, Themistocles 
<A NAME="151"></A>was, when he said that he could not sleep for the trophy of Miltiades; 
<A NAME="152"></A>entertaining such admiration for the virtue of Hercules, that in the night 
<A NAME="153"></A>his dreams were all of that hero's actions, and in the day a continual 
<A NAME="154"></A>emulation stirred him up to perform the like. Besides, they were related, 
<A NAME="155"></A>being born of cousins-german. For Aethra was daughter of Pittheus, and 
<A NAME="156"></A>Alcmena of Lysidice; and Lysidice and Pittheus were brother and sister, 
<A NAME="157"></A>children of Hippodamia and Pelops. He thought it therefore a dishonourable 
<A NAME="158"></A>thing, and not to be endured, that Hercules should go out everywhere, and 
<A NAME="159"></A>purge both land and sea from wicked men, and he himself should fly from 
<A NAME="160"></A>the like adventures that actually came in his way; disgracing his reputed 
<A NAME="161"></A>father by a mean flight by sea, and not showing his true one as good evidence 
<A NAME="162"></A>of the greatness of his birth by noble and worthy actions, as by the token 
<A NAME="163"></A>that he brought with him the shoes and the sword.
<A NAME="164"></A><BR><BR>With this mind and these thoughts, he set forward with a design 
<A NAME="165"></A>to do injury to nobody, but to repel and revenge himself of all those that 
<A NAME="166"></A>should offer any. And first of all, in a set combat, he slew Periphetes, 
<A NAME="167"></A>in the neighbourhood of Epidaurus, who used a club for his arms, and from 
<A NAME="168"></A>thence had the name of Corynetes, or the club-bearer; who seized upon him, 
<A NAME="169"></A>and forbade him to go forward in his journey. Being pleased with the club, 
<A NAME="170"></A>he took it, and made it his weapon, continuing to use it as Hercules did 
<A NAME="171"></A>the lion's skin, on whose shoulders that served to prove how huge a beast 
<A NAME="172"></A>he had killed; and to the same end Theseus carried about him this club; 
<A NAME="173"></A>overcome indeed by him, but now in his hands, invincible.
<A NAME="174"></A><BR><BR>Passing on further towards the Isthmus of Peloponnesus, he slew 
<A NAME="175"></A>Sinnis, often surnamed the Bender of Pines, after the same manner in which 
<A NAME="176"></A>he himself had destroyed many others before. And this he did without having 
<A NAME="177"></A>either practised or ever learnt the art of bending these trees, to show 
<A NAME="178"></A>that natural strength is above all art. This Sinnis had a daughter of remarkable 
<A NAME="179"></A>beauty and stature, called Perigune, who, when her father was killed, fled, 
<A NAME="180"></A>and was sought after everywhere by Theseus; and coming into a place overgrown 
<A NAME="181"></A>with brushwood, shrubs, and asparagus-thorn, there, in a childlike innocent 
<A NAME="182"></A>manner, prayed and begged them, as if they understood her, to give her 
<A NAME="183"></A>shelter, with vows that if she escaped she would never cut them down nor 
<A NAME="184"></A>burn them. But Theseus calling upon her, and giving her his promise that 
<A NAME="185"></A>he would use her with respect, and offer her no injury, she came forth, 
<A NAME="186"></A>and in due time bore him a son, named Melanippus; but afterwards was married 
<A NAME="187"></A>to Deioneus, the son of Eurytus, the Oechalian, Theseus himself giving 
<A NAME="188"></A>her to him. Ioxus, the son of this Melanippus, who was born to Theseus, 
<A NAME="189"></A>accompanied Ornytus in the colony that he carried with him into Caria, 
<A NAME="190"></A>whence it is a family usage amongst the people called Ioxids, both male 
<A NAME="191"></A>and female, never to burn either shrubs or asparagus-thorn, but to respect 
<A NAME="192"></A>and honour them.
<A NAME="193"></A><BR><BR>The Crommyonian sow, which they called Phaea, was a savage and 
<A NAME="194"></A>formidable wild beast, by no means an enemy to be despised. Theseus killed 
<A NAME="195"></A>her, going out of his way on purpose to meet and engage her, so that he 
<A NAME="196"></A>might not seem to perform all his great exploits out of mere necessity; 
<A NAME="197"></A>being also of opinion that it was the part of a brave man to chastise villainous 
<A NAME="198"></A>and wicked men when attacked by them, but to seek out and overcome the 
<A NAME="199"></A>more noble wild beasts. Others relate that Phaea was a woman, a robber 
<A NAME="200"></A>full of cruelty and lust, that lived in Crommyon, and had the name of Sow 
<A NAME="201"></A>given her from the foulness of her life and manners, and afterwards was 
<A NAME="202"></A>killed by Theseus. He slew also Sciron, upon the borders of Megara, casting 
<A NAME="203"></A>him down from the rocks, being, as most report, a notorious robber of all 
<A NAME="204"></A>passengers, and, as others add, accustomed, out of insolence and wantonness, 
<A NAME="205"></A>to stretch forth his feet to strangers commanding them to wash them, and 
<A NAME="206"></A>then while they did it, with a kick to send them down the rock into the 
<A NAME="207"></A>sea. The writers of Megara, however, in contradiction to the received report, 
<A NAME="208"></A>and, as Simonides expresses it, "fighting with all antiquity," contend 
<A NAME="209"></A>that Sciron was neither a robber nor doer of violence, but a punisher of 
<A NAME="210"></A>all such, and the relative and friend of good and just men; for Aeacus, 
<A NAME="211"></A>they say, was ever esteemed a man of the greatest sanctity of all the Greeks; 
<A NAME="212"></A>and Cychreus, the Salaminian, was honoured at Athens with divine worship; 
<A NAME="213"></A>and the virtues of Peleus and Telamon were not unknown to any one. Now 
<A NAME="214"></A>Sciron was son-in-law to Cychreus, father-in-law to Aeacus, and grandfather 
<A NAME="215"></A>to Peleus and Telamon, who were both of them sons of Endeis, the daughter 
<A NAME="216"></A>of Sciron and Chariclo; it was not probable, therefore, that the best of 
<A NAME="217"></A>men should make these alliances with one who was worst, giving and receiving 
<A NAME="218"></A>mutually what was of greatest value and most dear to them. Theseus, by 
<A NAME="219"></A>their account, did not slay Sciron in his first journey to Athens, but 
<A NAME="220"></A>afterwards, when he took Eleusis, a city of the Megarians, having circumvented 
<A NAME="221"></A>Diocles, the governor. Such are the contradictions in this story. In Eleusis 
<A NAME="222"></A>he killed Cercyon, the Arcadian, in a wrestling match. And going on a little 
<A NAME="223"></A>farther, in Erineus, he slew Damastes, otherwise called Procrustes, forcing 
<A NAME="224"></A>his body to the size of his own bed, as he himself was used to do with 
<A NAME="225"></A>all strangers; this he did in imitation of Hercules, who always returned 
<A NAME="226"></A>upon his assailants the same sort of violence that they offered to him; 
<A NAME="227"></A>sacrificed Busiris, killed Antaeus in wrestling, and Cycnus in single combat, 
<A NAME="228"></A>and Termerus by breaking his skull in pieces (whence, they say, comes the 
<A NAME="229"></A>proverb of "a Termerian mischief"), for it seems Termerus killed passengers 
<A NAME="230"></A>that he met by running with his head against them. And so also Theseus 
<A NAME="231"></A>proceeded in the punishment of evil men, who underwent the same violence 
<A NAME="232"></A>from him which they had inflicted upon others, justly suffering after the 
<A NAME="233"></A>manner of their own injustice.
<A NAME="234"></A><BR><BR>As he went forward on his journey, and was come as far as the river 
<A NAME="235"></A>Cephisus, some of the race of the Phytalidae met him and saluted him, and 
<A NAME="236"></A>upon his desire to use the purifications, then in custom, they performed 
<A NAME="237"></A>them with all the usual ceremonies, and, having offered propitiatory sacrifices 
<A NAME="238"></A>to the gods, invited him and entertained him at their house, a kindness 
<A NAME="239"></A>which, in all his journey hitherto, he had not met.
<A NAME="240"></A><BR><BR>On the eighth day of Cronius, now called Hecatombaeon, he arrived 
<A NAME="241"></A>at Athens, where he found the public affairs full of all confusion, and 
<A NAME="242"></A>divided into parties and factions, Aegeus also, and his whole private family, 
<A NAME="243"></A>labouring under the same distemper; for Medea, having fled from Corinth, 
<A NAME="244"></A>and promised Aegeus to make him, by her art, capable of having children, 
<A NAME="245"></A>was living with him. She first was aware of Theseus, whom as yet Aegeus 
<A NAME="246"></A>did not know, and he being in years, full of jealousies and suspicions, 
<A NAME="247"></A>and fearing everything by reason of the faction that was then in the city, 
<A NAME="248"></A>she easily persuaded him to kill him by poison at a banquet, to which he 
<A NAME="249"></A>was to be invited as a stranger. He, coming to the entertainment, thought 
<A NAME="250"></A>it not fit to discover himself at once, but willing to give his father 
<A NAME="251"></A>the occasion of first finding him out, the meat being on the table, he 
<A NAME="252"></A>drew his sword as if he designed to cut with it; Aegeus, at once recognising 
<A NAME="253"></A>the token, threw down the cup of poison, and, questioning his son, embraced 
<A NAME="254"></A>him, and having gathered together all his citizens, owned him publicly 
<A NAME="255"></A>before them, who, on their part, received him gladly for the fame of his 
<A NAME="256"></A>greatness and bravery; and it is said, that when the cup fell, the poison 
<A NAME="257"></A>was spilt there where now is the enclosed space in the Delphinium; for 
<A NAME="258"></A>in that place stood Aegeus's house, and the figure of Mercury on the east 
<A NAME="259"></A>side of the temple is called the Mercury of Aegeus's 
<A NAME="260"></A>gate.
<A NAME="261"></A><BR><BR>The sons of Pallas, who before were quiet upon expectation of recovering 
<A NAME="262"></A>the kingdom after Aegeus's death, who was without issue, as soon as Theseus 
<A NAME="263"></A>appeared and was acknowledged the successor, highly resenting that Aegeus 
<A NAME="264"></A>first, an adopted son only of Pandion, and not at all related to the family 
<A NAME="265"></A>of Erechtheus, should be holding the kingdom, and that after him, Theseus, 
<A NAME="266"></A>a visitor and stranger, should be destined to succeed to it, broke out 
<A NAME="267"></A>into open war. And dividing themselves into two companies, one part of 
<A NAME="268"></A>them marched openly from Sphettus, with their father, against the city, 
<A NAME="269"></A>the other, hiding themselves in the village of Gargettus, lay in ambush, 
<A NAME="270"></A>with a design to set upon the enemy on both sides. They had with them a 
<A NAME="271"></A>crier of the township of Agnus, named Leos, who discovered to Theseus all 
<A NAME="272"></A>the designs of the Pallantidae. He immediately fell upon those that lay 
<A NAME="273"></A>in ambuscade, and cut them all off; upon tidings of which Pallas and his 
<A NAME="274"></A>company fled and were dispersed.
<A NAME="275"></A><BR><BR>From hence they say is derived the custom among the people of the 
<A NAME="276"></A>township of Pallene to have no marriages or any alliance with the people 
<A NAME="277"></A>of Agnus, nor to suffer the criers to pronounce in their proclamations 
<A NAME="278"></A>the words used in all other parts of the country, Acouete Leoi (Hear ye 
<A NAME="279"></A>people), hating the very sound of Leo, because of the treason of 
<A NAME="280"></A>Leos.
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR>Theseus, longing to be in action, and desirous also to make himself 
<A NAME="282"></A>popular, left Athens to fight with the bull of Marathon, which did no small 
<A NAME="283"></A>mischief to the inhabitants of Tetrapolis. And having overcome it, he brought 
<A NAME="284"></A>it alive in triumph through the city, and afterwards sacrificed it to the 
<A NAME="285"></A>Delphinian Apollo. The story of Hecale, also, of her receiving and entertaining 
<A NAME="286"></A>Theseus in this expedition, seems to be not altogether void of truth; for 
<A NAME="287"></A>the townships round about, meeting upon a certain day, used to offer a 
<A NAME="288"></A>sacrifice which they called Hecalesia, to Jupiter Hecaleius, and to pay 
<A NAME="289"></A>honour to Hecale, whom, by a diminutive name, they called Hecalene, because 
<A NAME="290"></A>she, while entertaining Theseus, who was quite a youth, addressed him, 
<A NAME="291"></A>as old people do, with similar endearing diminutives; and having made a 
<A NAME="292"></A>vow to Jupiter for him as he was going to the fight, that, if he returned 
<A NAME="293"></A>in safety, she would offer sacrifices in thanks of it, and dying before 
<A NAME="294"></A>he came back, she had these honours given her by way of return for her 
<A NAME="295"></A>hospitality, by the command of Theseus, as Philochorus tells 
<A NAME="296"></A>us.
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR>Not long after arrived the third time from Crete the collectors 
<A NAME="298"></A>of the tribute which the Athenians paid them upon the following occasion. 
<A NAME="299"></A>Androgeus having been treacherously murdered in the confines of Attica, 
<A NAME="300"></A>not only Minos, his father, put the Athenians to extreme distress by a 
<A NAME="301"></A>perpetual war, but the gods also laid waste their country; both famine 
<A NAME="302"></A>and pestilence lay heavy upon them, and even their rivers were dried up. 
<A NAME="303"></A>Being told by the oracle that, if they appeased and reconciled Minos, the 
<A NAME="304"></A>anger of the gods would cease and they should enjoy rest from the miseries 
<A NAME="305"></A>they laboured under, they sent heralds, and with much supplication were 
<A NAME="306"></A>at last reconciled, entering into an agreement to send to Crete every nine 
<A NAME="307"></A>years a tribute of seven young men and as many virgins, as most writers 
<A NAME="308"></A>agree in stating; and the most poetical story adds, that the Minotaur destroyed 
<A NAME="309"></A>them, or that, wandering in the labyrinth, and finding no possible means 
<A NAME="310"></A>of getting out, they miserably ended their lives there; and that this Minotaur 
<A NAME="311"></A>was (as Euripides hath it)-
<A NAME="312"></A><BR><BR>"A mingled form where two strange shapes combined,
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>And different natures, bull and man, were joined." But Philochorus 
<A NAME="314"></A>says that the Cretans will by no means allow the truth of this, but say 
<A NAME="315"></A>that the labyrinth was only an ordinary prison, having no other bad quality 
<A NAME="316"></A>but that it secured the prisoners from escaping, and that Minos, having 
<A NAME="317"></A>instituted games in honour of Androgeus, gave, as a reward to the victors, 
<A NAME="318"></A>these youths, who in the meantime were kept in the labyrinth; and that 
<A NAME="319"></A>the first that overcame in those games was one of the greatest power and 
<A NAME="320"></A>command among them, named Taurus, a man of no merciful or gentle disposition, 
<A NAME="321"></A>who treated the Athenians that were made his prize in a proud and cruel 
<A NAME="322"></A>manner. Also Aristotle himself, in the account that he gives of the form 
<A NAME="323"></A>of government of the Bottiaeans, is manifestly of opinion that the youths 
<A NAME="324"></A>were not slain by Minos, but spent the remainder of their days in slavery 
<A NAME="325"></A>in Crete; that the Cretans, in former times, to acquit themselves of an 
<A NAME="326"></A>ancient vow which they had made, were used to send an offering of the first-fruits 
<A NAME="327"></A>of their men to Delphi, and that some descendants of these Athenian slaves 
<A NAME="328"></A>were mingled with them and sent amongst them, and, unable to get their 
<A NAME="329"></A>living there, removed from thence, first into Italy, and settled about 
<A NAME="330"></A>Japygia; from thence again, that they removed to Thrace, and were named 
<A NAME="331"></A>Bottiaeans; and that this is the reason why, in a certain sacrifice, the 
<A NAME="332"></A>Bottiaean girls sing a hymn beginning Let us go to Athens. This may show 
<A NAME="333"></A>us how dangerous it is to incur the hostility of a city that is mistress 
<A NAME="334"></A>of eloquence and song. For Minos was always ill spoken of, and represented 
<A NAME="335"></A>ever as a very wicked man, in the Athenian theatres; neither did Hesiod 
<A NAME="336"></A>avail him by calling him "the most royal Minos," nor Homer, who styles 
<A NAME="337"></A>him "Jupiter's familiar friend;" the tragedians got the better, and from 
<A NAME="338"></A>the vantage ground of the stage showered down obloquy upon him, as a man 
<A NAME="339"></A>of cruelty and violence; whereas, in fact, he appears to have been a king 
<A NAME="340"></A>and a law-giver, and Rhadamanthus, a judge under him, administering the 
<A NAME="341"></A>statutes that he ordained.
<A NAME="342"></A><BR><BR>Now, when the time of the third tribute was come, and the fathers 
<A NAME="343"></A>who had any young men for their sons were to proceed by lot to the choice 
<A NAME="344"></A>of those that were to be sent, there arose fresh discontents and accusations 
<A NAME="345"></A>against Aegeus among the people, who were full of grief and indignation 
<A NAME="346"></A>that he who was the cause of all their miseries was the only person exempt 
<A NAME="347"></A>from the punishment; adopting and settling his kingdom upon a bastard and 
<A NAME="348"></A>foreign son, he took no thought, they said, of their destitution and loss, 
<A NAME="349"></A>not of bastards, but lawful children. These things sensibly affected Theseus, 
<A NAME="350"></A>who, thinking it but just not to disregard, but rather partake of, the 
<A NAME="351"></A>sufferings of his fellow-citizens, offered himself for one without any 
<A NAME="352"></A>lot. All else were struck with admiration for the nobleness and with love 
<A NAME="353"></A>for the goodness of the act; and Aegeus, after prayers and entreaties, 
<A NAME="354"></A>finding him inflexible and not to be persuaded, proceeded to the choosing 
<A NAME="355"></A>of the rest by lot. Hellanicus, however, tells us that the Athenians did 
<A NAME="356"></A>not send the young men and virgins by lot, but that Minos himself used 
<A NAME="357"></A>to come and make his own choice, and pitched upon Theseus before all others; 
<A NAME="358"></A>according to the conditions agreed upon between them, namely, that the 
<A NAME="359"></A>Athenians should furnish them with a ship and that the young men that were 
<A NAME="360"></A>to sail with him should carry no weapons of war; but that if the Minotaur 
<A NAME="361"></A>was destroyed, the tribute should cease.
<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR>On the two former occasions of the payment of the tribute, entertaining 
<A NAME="363"></A>no hopes of safety or return, they sent out the ship with a black sail, 
<A NAME="364"></A>as to unavoidable destruction; but now, Theseus encouraging his father, 
<A NAME="365"></A>and speaking greatly of himself, as confident that he should kill the Minotaur, 
<A NAME="366"></A>he gave the pilot another sail, which was white, commanding him, as he 
<A NAME="367"></A>returned, if Theseus were safe, to make use of that; but if not, to sail 
<A NAME="368"></A>with the black one, and to hang out that sign of his misfortune. Simonides 
<A NAME="369"></A>says that the sail which Aegeus delivered to the pilot was not white, 
<A NAME="370"></A>but-
<A NAME="371"></A><BR><BR>"Scarlet, in the juicy bloom
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>Of the living oak-tree steeped," and that this was to be the sign of 
<A NAME="373"></A>their escape. Phereclus, son of Amarsyas, according to Simonides, was pilot 
<A NAME="374"></A>of the ship. But Philochorus says Theseus had sent him by Scirus, from 
<A NAME="375"></A>Salamis, Nausithous to be his steersman, and Phaeax his look-out-man in 
<A NAME="376"></A>the prow, the Athenians having as yet not applied themselves to navigation; 
<A NAME="377"></A>and that Scirus did this because one of the young men, Menesthes, was his 
<A NAME="378"></A>daughter's son; and this the chapels of Nausithous and Phaeax, built by 
<A NAME="379"></A>Theseus near the temple of Scirus, confirm. He adds, also, that the feast 
<A NAME="380"></A>named Cybernesia was in honour of them. The lot being cast, and Theseus 
<A NAME="381"></A>having received out of the Prytaneum those upon whom it fell, he went to 
<A NAME="382"></A>the Delphinium, and made an offering for them to Apollo of his suppliant's 
<A NAME="383"></A>badge, which was a bough of a consecrated olive tree, with white wool tied 
<A NAME="384"></A>about it.
<A NAME="385"></A><BR><BR>Having thus performed his devotion, he went to sea, the sixth day 
<A NAME="386"></A>of Munychion, on which day even to this time the Athenians send their virgins 
<A NAME="387"></A>to the same temple to make supplication to the gods. It is farther reported 
<A NAME="388"></A>that he was commanded by the oracle of Delphi to make Venus his guide, 
<A NAME="389"></A>and to invoke her as the companion and conductress of his voyage and that, 
<A NAME="390"></A>as he was sacrificing a she goat to her by the sea-side, it was suddenly 
<A NAME="391"></A>changed into a he, and for this cause that goddess had the name of 
<A NAME="392"></A>Epitragia.
<A NAME="393"></A><BR><BR>When he arrived at Crete, as most of the ancient historians as 
<A NAME="394"></A>well as poets tell us, having a clue of thread given him by Ariadne, who 
<A NAME="395"></A>had fallen in love with him, and being instructed by her how to use it 
<A NAME="396"></A>so as to conduct him through the windings of the labyrinth, he escaped 
<A NAME="397"></A>out of it and slew the Minotaur, and sailed back, taking along with him 
<A NAME="398"></A>Ariadne and the young Athenian captives. Phercydes adds that he bored holes 
<A NAME="399"></A>in the bottom of the Cretan ships to hinder their pursuit. Demon writes 
<A NAME="400"></A>that Taurus, the chief captain of Minos, was slain by Theseus at the mouth 
<A NAME="401"></A>of the port, in a naval combat as he was sailing out for Athens. But Philochorus 
<A NAME="402"></A>gives us the story thus: That at the setting forth of the yearly games 
<A NAME="403"></A>by King Minos, Taurus was expected to carry away the prize, as he had done 
<A NAME="404"></A>before; and was much grudged the honour. His character and manners made 
<A NAME="405"></A>his power hateful, and he was accused moreover of too near familiarity 
<A NAME="406"></A>with Pasiphae, for which reason, when Theseus desired the combat, Minos 
<A NAME="407"></A>readily complied. And as it was a custom in Crete that the women also should 
<A NAME="408"></A>be admitted to the sight of these games, Ariadne, being present, was struck 
<A NAME="409"></A>with admiration of the manly beauty of Theseus, and the vigour and address 
<A NAME="410"></A>which he showed in the combat, overcoming all that encountered with him. 
<A NAME="411"></A>Minos, too, being extremely pleased with him, especially because he had 
<A NAME="412"></A>overthrown and disgraced Taurus, voluntarily gave up the young captives 
<A NAME="413"></A>to Theseus, and remitted the tribute to the Athenians. Clidemus gives an 
<A NAME="414"></A>account peculiar to himself, very ambitiously, and beginning a great way 
<A NAME="415"></A>back: That it was a decree consented to by all Greece, that no vessel from 
<A NAME="416"></A>any place, containing above five persons, should be permitted to sail, 
<A NAME="417"></A>Jason only excepted, who was made captain of the great ship Argo, to sail 
<A NAME="418"></A>about and scour the sea of pirates. But Daedalus having escaped from Crete, 
<A NAME="419"></A>and flying by sea to Athens, Minos, contrary to this decree, pursued him 
<A NAME="420"></A>with his ships of war, was forced by a storm upon Sicily, and there ended 
<A NAME="421"></A>his life. After his decease, Deucalion, his son, desiring a quarrel with 
<A NAME="422"></A>the Athenians, sent to them, demanding that they should deliver up Daedalus 
<A NAME="423"></A>to him, threatening upon their refusal, to put to death all the young Athenians 
<A NAME="424"></A>whom his father had received as hostages from the city. To this angry message 
<A NAME="425"></A>Theseus returned a very gentle answer excusing himself that he could not 
<A NAME="426"></A>deliver up Daedalus, who was nearly related to him, being his cousin-german, 
<A NAME="427"></A>his mother being Merope, the daughter of Erechtheus. In the meanwhile he 
<A NAME="428"></A>secretly prepared a navy, part of it at home near the village of the Thymoetadae, 
<A NAME="429"></A>a place of no resort, and far from any common roads, the other part by 
<A NAME="430"></A>his grandfather Pittheus's means at Troezen, that so his design might be 
<A NAME="431"></A>carried on with the greatest secrecy. As soon as ever his fleet was in 
<A NAME="432"></A>readiness, he set sail, having with him Daedalus and other exiles from 
<A NAME="433"></A>Crete for his guides; and none of the Cretans having any knowledge of his 
<A NAME="434"></A>coming, but imagining when they saw his fleet that they were friends and 
<A NAME="435"></A>vessels of their own, he soon made himself master of the port, and immediately 
<A NAME="436"></A>making a descent, reached Gnossus before any notice of his coming, and, 
<A NAME="437"></A>in a battle before the gates of the labyrinth, put Deucalion and all his 
<A NAME="438"></A>guards to the sword. The government by this means falling to Ariadne, he 
<A NAME="439"></A>made a league with her, and received the captives of her, and ratified 
<A NAME="440"></A>a perpetual friendship between the Athenians and the Cretans, whom he engaged 
<A NAME="441"></A>under an oath never again to commence any war with Athens.
<A NAME="442"></A><BR><BR>There are yet many other traditions about these things, and as 
<A NAME="443"></A>many concerning Ariadne, all inconsistent with each other. Some relate 
<A NAME="444"></A>that she hung herself, being deserted by Theseus. Others that she was carried 
<A NAME="445"></A>away by his sailors to the isle of Naxos, and married to Oenarus, priest 
<A NAME="446"></A>of Bacchus; and that Theseus left her because he fell in love with 
<A NAME="447"></A>another-
<A NAME="448"></A><BR><BR>"For Aegle's love was burning in his breast; a verse which Hereas, 
<A NAME="449"></A>the Megarian, says was formerly in the poet Hesiod's works, but put out 
<A NAME="450"></A>by Pisistratus, in like manner as he added in Homer's Raising of the Dead, 
<A NAME="451"></A>to gratify the Athenians, the line-
<A NAME="452"></A><BR><BR>"Theseus, Pirithous, mighty son of gods." Others say Ariadne had 
<A NAME="453"></A>sons also by Theseus, Oenopion and Staphylus; and among these is the poet 
<A NAME="454"></A>Ion of Chios, who writes of his own native city-
<A NAME="455"></A><BR><BR>"Which once Oenopion, son of Theseus built." But the more famous 
<A NAME="456"></A>of the legendary stories everybody (as I may say) has in his mouth. In 
<A NAME="457"></A>Paeon, however, the Amathusian, there is a story given, differing from 
<A NAME="458"></A>the rest. For he writes that Theseus, being driven by a storm upon the 
<A NAME="459"></A>isle of Cyprus, and having aboard with him Ariadne, big with child, and 
<A NAME="460"></A>extremely discomposed with the rolling of the sea, set her on shore, and 
<A NAME="461"></A>left her there alone, to return himself and help the ship, when, on a sudden, 
<A NAME="462"></A>a violent wind carried him again out to sea. That the women of the island 
<A NAME="463"></A>received Ariadne very kindly, and did all they could to console and alleviate 
<A NAME="464"></A>her distress at being left behind. That they counterfeited kind letters, 
<A NAME="465"></A>and delivered them to her, as sent from Theseus, and, when she fell in 
<A NAME="466"></A>labour, were diligent in performing to her every needful service; but that 
<A NAME="467"></A>she died before she could be delivered, and was honourably interred. That 
<A NAME="468"></A>soon after Theseus returned, and was greatly afflicted for her loss, and 
<A NAME="469"></A>at his departure left a sum of money among the people of the island, ordering 
<A NAME="470"></A>them to do sacrifice to Ariadne; and caused two little images to be made 
<A NAME="471"></A>and dedicated to her, one of silver and the other of brass. Moreover, that 
<A NAME="472"></A>on the second day of Gorpiaeus, which is sacred to Ariadne, they have this 
<A NAME="473"></A>ceremony among their sacrifices, to have a youth lie down and with his 
<A NAME="474"></A>voice and gesture represent the pains of a woman in travail; and that the 
<A NAME="475"></A>Amathusians call the grove in which they show her tomb, the grove of Venus 
<A NAME="476"></A>Ariadne.
<A NAME="477"></A><BR><BR>Differing yet from this account, some of the Naxians write that 
<A NAME="478"></A>there were two Minoses and two Ariadnes, one of whom, they say, was married 
<A NAME="479"></A>to Bacchus, in the isle of Naxos, and bore the children Staphylus and his 
<A NAME="480"></A>brother; but that the other, of a later age, was carried off by Theseus, 
<A NAME="481"></A>and, being afterwards deserted by him, retired to Naxos, with her nurse 
<A NAME="482"></A>Corcyna, whose grave they yet show. That this Ariadne also died there, 
<A NAME="483"></A>and was worshipped by the island, but in a different manner from the former; 
<A NAME="484"></A>for her day is celebrated with general joy and revelling, but all the sacrifices 
<A NAME="485"></A>performed to the latter are attended with mourning and 
<A NAME="486"></A>gloom.
<A NAME="487"></A><BR><BR>Now Theseus, in his return from Crete, put in at Delos, and having 
<A NAME="488"></A>sacrificed to the god of the island, dedicated to the temple the image 
<A NAME="489"></A>of Venus which Ariadne had given him, and danced with the young Athenians 
<A NAME="490"></A>a dance that, in memory of him, they say is still preserved among the inhabitants 
<A NAME="491"></A>of Delos, consisting in certain measured turnings and returnings, imitative 
<A NAME="492"></A>of the windings and twistings of the labyrinth. And this dance, as Dicaearchus 
<A NAME="493"></A>writes, is called among the Delians the Crane. This he danced around the 
<A NAME="494"></A>Ceratonian Altar, so called from its consisting of horns taken from the 
<A NAME="495"></A>left side of the head. They say also that he instituted games in Delos, 
<A NAME="496"></A>where he was the first that began the custom of giving a palm to the 
<A NAME="497"></A>victors.
<A NAME="498"></A><BR><BR>When they were come near the coast of Attica, so great was the 
<A NAME="499"></A>joy for the happy success of their voyage, that neither Theseus himself 
<A NAME="500"></A>nor the pilot remembered to hang out the sail which should have been the 
<A NAME="501"></A>token of their safety to Aegeus, who, in despair at the sight, threw himself 
<A NAME="502"></A>headlong from a rock, and perished in the sea. But Theseus being arrived 
<A NAME="503"></A>at the port of Phalerum, paid there the sacrifices which he had vowed to 
<A NAME="504"></A>the gods at his setting out to sea, and sent a herald to the city to carry 
<A NAME="505"></A>the news of his safe return. At his entrance, the herald found the people 
<A NAME="506"></A>for the most part full of grief for the loss of their king; others, as 
<A NAME="507"></A>may well be believed, as full of joy for the tidings that he brought, and 
<A NAME="508"></A>eager to welcome him and crown him with garlands for his good news, which 
<A NAME="509"></A>he indeed accepted of, but hung them upon his herald's staff; and thus 
<A NAME="510"></A>returning to the seaside before Theseus had finished his libation to the 
<A NAME="511"></A>gods, he stayed apart for fear of disturbing the holy rites; but, as soon 
<A NAME="512"></A>as the libation was ended, went up and related the king's death, upon the 
<A NAME="513"></A>hearing of which, with great lamentations and a confused tumult of grief, 
<A NAME="514"></A>they ran with all haste to the city. And from hence, they say, it comes 
<A NAME="515"></A>that at this day, in the feast of Oschophoria, the herald is not crowned, 
<A NAME="516"></A>but his staff, and all who are present at the libation cry out eleleu, 
<A NAME="517"></A>iou, iou, the first of which confused sounds is commonly used by men in 
<A NAME="518"></A>haste, or at a triumph, the other is proper to people in consternation 
<A NAME="519"></A>or disorder of mind.
<A NAME="520"></A><BR><BR>Theseus, after the funeral of his father, paid his vows to Apollo 
<A NAME="521"></A>the seventh day of Pyanepsion; for on that day the youth that returned 
<A NAME="522"></A>with him safe from Crete made their entry into the city. They say, also, 
<A NAME="523"></A>that the custom of boiling pulse at this feast is derived from hence; because 
<A NAME="524"></A>the young men that escaped put all that was left of their provision together, 
<A NAME="525"></A>and, boiling it in one common pot, feasted themselves with it, and ate 
<A NAME="526"></A>it all up together. Hence, also, they carry in procession an olive branch 
<A NAME="527"></A>bound about with wool (such as they then made use of in their supplications), 
<A NAME="528"></A>which they call Eiresione, crowned with all sorts of fruits, to signify 
<A NAME="529"></A>that scarcity and barrenness was ceased, singing in their procession this 
<A NAME="530"></A>song:-
<A NAME="531"></A><BR><BR>"Eiresione bring figs, and Eiresione bring loaves;
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>Bring us boney in pints, and oil to rub on our bodies,
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>And a strong flagon of wine, for all to go mellow to bed on." Although 
<A NAME="534"></A>some hold opinion that this ceremony is retained in memory of the Heraclidae, 
<A NAME="535"></A>who were thus entertained and brought up by the Athenians. But most are 
<A NAME="536"></A>of the opinion which we have given above.
<A NAME="537"></A><BR><BR>The ship wherein Theseus and the youth of Athens returned had thirty 
<A NAME="538"></A>oars, and was preserved by the Athenians down even to the time of Demetrius 
<A NAME="539"></A>Phalereus, for they took away the old planks as they decayed, putting in 
<A NAME="540"></A>new and stronger timber in their place, insomuch that this ship became 
<A NAME="541"></A>a standing example among the philosophers, for the logical question of 
<A NAME="542"></A>things that grow; one side holding that the ship remained the same, and 
<A NAME="543"></A>the other contending that it was not the same.
<A NAME="544"></A><BR><BR>The feast called Oschophoria, or the feast of boughs, which to 
<A NAME="545"></A>this day the Athenians celebrate, was then first instituted by Theseus. 
<A NAME="546"></A>For he took not with him the full number of virgins which by lot were to 
<A NAME="547"></A>be carried away, but selected two youths of his acquaintance, of fair and 
<A NAME="548"></A>womanish faces, but of a manly and forward spirit, and having, by frequent 
<A NAME="549"></A>baths, and avoiding the heat and scorching of the sun, with a constant 
<A NAME="550"></A>use of all the ointments and washes and dresses that serve to the adorning 
<A NAME="551"></A>of the head or smoothing the skin or improving the complexion, in a manner 
<A NAME="552"></A>changed them from what they were before, and having taught them farther 
<A NAME="553"></A>to counterfeit the very voice and carriage and gait of virgins so that 
<A NAME="554"></A>there could not be the least difference perceived, he, undiscovered by 
<A NAME="555"></A>any, put them into the number of the Athenian maids designed for Crete. 
<A NAME="556"></A>At his return, he and these two youths led up a solemn procession, in the 
<A NAME="557"></A>same habit that is now worn by those who carry the vine-branches. Those 
<A NAME="558"></A>branches they carry in honour of Bacchus and Ariadne, for the sake of their 
<A NAME="559"></A>story before related; or rather because they happened to return in autumn, 
<A NAME="560"></A>the time of gathering the grapes. The women, whom they call Deipnopherae, 
<A NAME="561"></A>or supper-carriers, are taken into these ceremonies, and assist at the 
<A NAME="562"></A>sacrifice, in remembrance and imitation of the mothers of the young men 
<A NAME="563"></A>and virgins upon whom the lot fell, for thus they ran about bringing bread 
<A NAME="564"></A>and meat to their children; and because the women then told their sons 
<A NAME="565"></A>and daughters many tales and stories, to comfort and encourage them under 
<A NAME="566"></A>the danger they were going upon, it has still continued a custom that at 
<A NAME="567"></A>this feast old fables and tales should be told. For these particularities 
<A NAME="568"></A>we are indebted to the history of Demon. There was then a place chosen 
<A NAME="569"></A>out, and a temple erected in it to Theseus, and those families out of whom 
<A NAME="570"></A>the tribute of the youth was gathered were appointed to pay tax to the 
<A NAME="571"></A>temple for sacrifices to him. And the house of the Phytalidae had the overseeing 
<A NAME="572"></A>of these sacrifices, Theseus doing them that honour in recompense of their 
<A NAME="573"></A>former hospitality.
<A NAME="574"></A><BR><BR>Now, after the death of his father Aegeus, forming in his mind 
<A NAME="575"></A>a great and wonderful design, he gathered together all the inhabitants 
<A NAME="576"></A>of Attica into one town, and made them one people of one city, whereas 
<A NAME="577"></A>before they lived dispersed, and were not easy to assemble upon any affair 
<A NAME="578"></A>for the common interest. Nay, differences and even wars often occurred 
<A NAME="579"></A>between them, which he by his persuasions appeased, going from township 
<A NAME="580"></A>to township, and from tribe to tribe. And those of a more private and mean 
<A NAME="581"></A>condition readily embracing such good advice, to those of greater power 
<A NAME="582"></A>he promised a commonwealth without monarchy, a democracy, or people's government, 
<A NAME="583"></A>in which he should only be continued as their commander in war and the 
<A NAME="584"></A>protector of their laws, all things else being equally distributed among 
<A NAME="585"></A>them;- and by this means brought a part of them over to his proposal. The 
<A NAME="586"></A>rest, fearing his power, which was already grown very formidable, and knowing 
<A NAME="587"></A>his courage and resolution, chose rather to be persuaded than forced into 
<A NAME="588"></A>a compliance. He then dissolved all the distinct statehouses, council halls, 
<A NAME="589"></A>and magistracies, and built one common state-house and council hall on 
<A NAME="590"></A>the site of the present upper town, and gave the name of Athens to the 
<A NAME="591"></A>whole state, ordaining a common feast and sacrifice, which he called Panathenaea, 
<A NAME="592"></A>or the sacrifice of all the united Athenians. He instituted also another 
<A NAME="593"></A>sacrifice called Metoecia, or Feast of Migration, which is yet celebrated 
<A NAME="594"></A>on the sixteenth day of        Hecatombaeon. Then, as he had promised, 
<A NAME="595"></A>he laid down his regal power and proceeded to order a commonwealth, entering 
<A NAME="596"></A>upon this great work not without advice from the gods. For having sent 
<A NAME="597"></A>to consult the oracle of Delphi concerning the fortune of his new government 
<A NAME="598"></A>and city, he received this answer:-
<A NAME="599"></A><BR><BR>"Son of the Pitthean maid,
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>To your town the terms and fates,
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>My father gives of many states.
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>Be not anxious nor afraid;
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>The bladder will not fail to swim
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>On the waves that compass him." Which oracle, they say, one of the 
<A NAME="605"></A>sibyls long after did in a manner repeat to the Athenians, in this 
<A NAME="606"></A>verse:-
<A NAME="607"></A><BR><BR>"The bladder may be dipt, but not be drowned." Farther yet designing 
<A NAME="608"></A>to enlarge his city, he invited all strangers to come and enjoy equal privileges 
<A NAME="609"></A>with the natives, and it is said that the common form, Come hither, all 
<A NAME="610"></A>ye people, was the words that Theseus proclaimed when he thus set up a 
<A NAME="611"></A>commonwealth, in a manner, for all nations. Yet he did not suffer his state, 
<A NAME="612"></A>by the promiscuous multitude that flowed in, to be turned into confusion 
<A NAME="613"></A>and he left without any order or degree, but was the first that divided 
<A NAME="614"></A>the Commonwealth into three distinct ranks, the noblemen, the husbandmen, 
<A NAME="615"></A>and artificers. To the nobility he committed the care of religion, the 
<A NAME="616"></A>choice of magistrates, the teaching and dispensing of the laws, and interpretation 
<A NAME="617"></A>and direction in all sacred matters; the whole city being, as it were, 
<A NAME="618"></A>reduced to an exact equality, the nobles excelling the rest in honour, 
<A NAME="619"></A>the husbandmen in profit, and the artificers in number. And that Theseus 
<A NAME="620"></A>was the first, who, as Aristotle says, out of an inclination to popular 
<A NAME="621"></A>government, parted with the regal power, Homer also seems to testify, in 
<A NAME="622"></A>his catalogue of the ships, where he gives the name of People to the Athenians 
<A NAME="623"></A>only.
<A NAME="624"></A><BR><BR>He also coined money, and stamped it with the image of an ox, either 
<A NAME="625"></A>in memory of the Marathonian bull, or of Taurus, whom he vanquished, or 
<A NAME="626"></A>else to put his people in mind to follow husbandry; and from this coin 
<A NAME="627"></A>came the expression so frequent among the Greeks, of a thing being worth 
<A NAME="628"></A>ten or a hundred oxen. After this he joined Megara to Attica, and erected 
<A NAME="629"></A>that famous pillar on the Isthmus, which bears an inscription of two lines, 
<A NAME="630"></A>showing the bounds of the two countries that meet there. On the east side 
<A NAME="631"></A>the inscription is,-
<A NAME="632"></A><BR><BR>"Peloponnesus there, Ionia here" and on the west 
<A NAME="633"></A>side,-
<A NAME="634"></A><BR><BR>"Peloponnesus here, Ionia there." He also instituted the games, 
<A NAME="635"></A>in emulation of Hercules, being ambitious that as the Greeks, by that hero's 
<A NAME="636"></A>appointment, celebrated the Olympian games to the honour of Jupiter, so 
<A NAME="637"></A>by his institution, they should celebrate the Isthmian to the honour of 
<A NAME="638"></A>Neptune. For those that were there before observed, dedicated to Melicerta, 
<A NAME="639"></A>were performed privately in the night, and had the form rather of a religious 
<A NAME="640"></A>rite than of an open spectacle or public feast. There are some who say 
<A NAME="641"></A>that the Isthmian games were first instituted in memory of Sciron, Theseus 
<A NAME="642"></A>thus making expiation for his death, upon account of the nearness of kindred 
<A NAME="643"></A>between them, Sciron being the son of Canethus and Heniocha, the daughter 
<A NAME="644"></A>of Pittheus; though others write that Sinnis, not Sciron, was their son, 
<A NAME="645"></A>and that to his honour, and not to the other's, these games were ordained 
<A NAME="646"></A>by Theseus. At the same time he made an agreement with the Corinthians, 
<A NAME="647"></A>that they should allow those that came from Athens to the celebration of 
<A NAME="648"></A>the Isthmian games as much space of honour before the rest to behold the 
<A NAME="649"></A>spectacle in, as the sail of the ship that brought them thither stretched 
<A NAME="650"></A>to its full extent, could cover; so Hellanicus and Andro of Halicarnassus 
<A NAME="651"></A>have established.
<A NAME="652"></A><BR><BR>Concerning his voyage into the Euxine Sea, Philochorus and some 
<A NAME="653"></A>others write that he made it with Hercules, offering him his service in 
<A NAME="654"></A>the war against the Amazons, and had Antiope given him for the reward of 
<A NAME="655"></A>his valour; but the greater number, of whom are Pherecydes, Hellanicus, 
<A NAME="656"></A>and Herodorus, write that he made this voyage many years after Hercules, 
<A NAME="657"></A>with a navy under his own command, and took the Amazon prisoner- the more 
<A NAME="658"></A>probable story, for we do not read that any other, of all those that accompanied 
<A NAME="659"></A>him in this action, took any Amazon prisoner. Bion adds, that, to take 
<A NAME="660"></A>her, he had to use deceit and fly away; for the Amazons, he says, being 
<A NAME="661"></A>naturally lovers of men, were so far from avoiding Theseus when he touched 
<A NAME="662"></A>upon their coasts, that they sent him presents to his ship; but he, having 
<A NAME="663"></A>invited Antiope, who brought them, to come aboard, immediately set sail 
<A NAME="664"></A>and carried her away. An author named Menecrates, that wrote the History 
<A NAME="665"></A>of Nicae in Bithynia, adds, that Theseus, having Antiope aboard his vessel, 
<A NAME="666"></A>cruised for some time about those coasts, and that there were in the same 
<A NAME="667"></A>ship three young men of Athens, that accompanied him in this voyage, all 
<A NAME="668"></A>brothers, whose names were Euneos, Thoas, and soloon. The last of these 
<A NAME="669"></A>fell desperately in love with Antiope, and, escaping the notice of the 
<A NAME="670"></A>rest, revealed the secret only to one of his most intimate acquaintances, 
<A NAME="671"></A>and employed him to disclose his passion to Antiope; she rejected his pretences 
<A NAME="672"></A>with a very positive denial, yet treated the matter with much gentleness 
<A NAME="673"></A>and discretion, and made no complaint to Theseus of anything that had happened; 
<A NAME="674"></A>but Soloon, the thing being desperate, leaped into a river near the seaside 
<A NAME="675"></A>and drowned himself. As soon as Theseus was acquainted with his death, 
<A NAME="676"></A>and his unhappy love that was the cause of it, he was extremely distressed, 
<A NAME="677"></A>and, in the height of his grief, an oracle which he had formerly received 
<A NAME="678"></A>at Delphi came into his mind; for he had been commanded by the priestess 
<A NAME="679"></A>of Apollo Pythius, that wherever in a strange land he was most sorrowful 
<A NAME="680"></A>and under the greatest affliction, he should build a city there, and leave 
<A NAME="681"></A>some of his followers to be governors of the place. For this cause he there 
<A NAME="682"></A>founded a city, which he called, from the name of Apollo, Pythopolis, and, 
<A NAME="683"></A>in honour of the unfortunate youth, he named the river that runs by it 
<A NAME="684"></A>Soloon, and left the two surviving brothers intrusted with the care of 
<A NAME="685"></A>the government and laws, joining with them Hermus, one of the nobility 
<A NAME="686"></A>of Athens, from whom a place in the city is called the House of Hermus; 
<A NAME="687"></A>though by an error in the accent it has been taken for the House of Hermes, 
<A NAME="688"></A>or Mercury, and the honour that was designed to the hero, transferred to 
<A NAME="689"></A>the god.
<A NAME="690"></A><BR><BR>This was the origin and cause of the Amazonian invasion of Attica, 
<A NAME="691"></A>which would seem to have been no slight or womanish enterprise. For it 
<A NAME="692"></A>is impossible that they should have placed their camp in the very city, 
<A NAME="693"></A>and joined battle close by the Pnyx and the hill called Museum, unless, 
<A NAME="694"></A>having first conquered the country around about, they had thus with impunity 
<A NAME="695"></A>advanced to the city. That they made so long a journey by land, and passed 
<A NAME="696"></A>the Cimmerian Bosphorus, when frozen, as Hellanicus writes, is difficult 
<A NAME="697"></A>to be believed. That they encamped all but in the city is certain, and 
<A NAME="698"></A>may be sufficiently confirmed by the names that the places hereabout yet 
<A NAME="699"></A>retain, and the graves and monuments of those that fell in the battle. 
<A NAME="700"></A>Both armies being in sight, there was a long pause and doubt on each side 
<A NAME="701"></A>which should give the first onset; at last Theseus, having sacrificed to 
<A NAME="702"></A>Fear, in obedience to the command of an oracle he had received, gave them 
<A NAME="703"></A>battle; and this happened in the month of Boedromion, in which to this 
<A NAME="704"></A>very day the Athenians celebrate the Feast Boedromia. Clidemus, desirous 
<A NAME="705"></A>to be very circumstantial, writes that the left wing of the Amazons moved 
<A NAME="706"></A>towards the place which is yet called Amazonium and the right towards the 
<A NAME="707"></A>Pnyx, near Chrysa, that with this wing the Athenians, issuing from behind 
<A NAME="708"></A>the Museum, engaged, and that the graves of those that were slain are to 
<A NAME="709"></A>be seen in the street that leads to the gate called the Piraic, by the 
<A NAME="710"></A>chapel of the hero Chalcodon; and that here the Athenians were routed, 
<A NAME="711"></A>and gave way before the women, as far as to the temple of the Furies, but, 
<A NAME="712"></A>fresh supplies coming in from the Palladium, Ardettus, and the Lyceum, 
<A NAME="713"></A>they charged their right wing, and beat them back into their tents, in 
<A NAME="714"></A>which action a great number of the Amazons were slain. At length, after 
<A NAME="715"></A>four months, a peace was concluded between them by the mediation of Hippolyta 
<A NAME="716"></A>(for so this historian calls the Amazon whom Theseus married, and not Antiope), 
<A NAME="717"></A>though others write that she was slain with a dart by Molpadia, while fighting 
<A NAME="718"></A>by Theseus's side, and that the pillar which stands by the temple of Olympian 
<A NAME="719"></A>Earth was erected to her honour. Nor is it to be wondered at, that in events 
<A NAME="720"></A>of such antiquity, history should be in disorder. For indeed we are also 
<A NAME="721"></A>told that those of the Amazons that were wounded were privately sent away 
<A NAME="722"></A>by Antiope to Chalcis, where many by her care recovered, but some that 
<A NAME="723"></A>died were buried there in the place that is to this time called Amazonium. 
<A NAME="724"></A>That this war, however, was ended by a treaty is evident, both from the 
<A NAME="725"></A>name of the place adjoining to the temple of Theseus, called, from the 
<A NAME="726"></A>solemn oath there taken, Horcomosium; and also from the ancient sacrifice 
<A NAME="727"></A>which used to be celebrated to the Amazons the day before the Feast of 
<A NAME="728"></A>Theseus. The Megarians also show a spot in their city where some Amazons 
<A NAME="729"></A>were buried, on the way from the market to a place called Rhus, where the 
<A NAME="730"></A>building in the shape of a lozenge stands. It is said, likewise, that others 
<A NAME="731"></A>of them were slain near Chaeronea, and buried near the little rivulet formerly 
<A NAME="732"></A>called Thermodon, but now Haemon, of which an account is given in the life 
<A NAME="733"></A>of Demosthenes. It appears further that the passage of the Amazons through 
<A NAME="734"></A>Thessaly was not without opposition, for there are yet shown many tombs 
<A NAME="735"></A>of them near Scotussa and Cynoscephalae.
<A NAME="736"></A><BR><BR>This is as much as is worth telling concerning the Amazons. For 
<A NAME="737"></A>the account which the author of the poem called the Theseid gives of this 
<A NAME="738"></A>rising of the Amazons, how Antiope, to revenge herself upon Theseus for 
<A NAME="739"></A>refusing her and marrying Phaedra, came down upon the city with her train 
<A NAME="740"></A>of Amazons, whom Hercules slew, is manifestly nothing else but fable and 
<A NAME="741"></A>invention. It is true, indeed, that Theseus married Phaedra, but that was 
<A NAME="742"></A>after the death of Antiope, by whom he had a son called Hippolytus, or, 
<A NAME="743"></A>as Pindar writes, Demophon. The calamities which befell Phaedra and this 
<A NAME="744"></A>son, since none of the historians have contradicted the tragic poets that 
<A NAME="745"></A>have written of them, we must suppose happened as represented uniformly 
<A NAME="746"></A>by them.
<A NAME="747"></A><BR><BR>There are also other traditions of the marriages of Theseus, neither 
<A NAME="748"></A>honourable in their occasions nor fortunate in their events, which yet 
<A NAME="749"></A>were never represented in the Greek plays. For he is said to have carried 
<A NAME="750"></A>off Anaxo, a Troezenian, and having slain Sinnis and Cercyon, to have ravished 
<A NAME="751"></A>their daughters; to have married Periboea, the mother of Ajax, and then 
<A NAME="752"></A>Phereboea, and then Iope, the daughter of Iphicles. And further, he is 
<A NAME="753"></A>accused of deserting Ariadne (as is before related), being in love with 
<A NAME="754"></A>Aegle, the daughter of Panopeus, neither justly nor honourably; and lastly, 
<A NAME="755"></A>of the rape of Helen, which filled all Attica with war and blood, and was 
<A NAME="756"></A>in the end the occasion of his banishment and death, as will presently 
<A NAME="757"></A>be related.
<A NAME="758"></A><BR><BR>Herodorus is of opinion, that though there were many famous expeditions 
<A NAME="759"></A>undertaken by the bravest men of his time, yet Theseus never joined in 
<A NAME="760"></A>any of them, once only excepted, with the Lapithae, in their war against 
<A NAME="761"></A>the Centaurs; but others say that he accompanied Jason to Colchis and Meleager 
<A NAME="762"></A>to the slaying of the Calydonian boar, and that hence it came to be a proverb, 
<A NAME="763"></A>Not without Theseus; that he himself, however, without aid of any one, 
<A NAME="764"></A>performed many glorious exploits, and that from him began the saying, He 
<A NAME="765"></A>is a second Hercules. He also joined Adrastus in recovering the bodies 
<A NAME="766"></A>of those that were slain before Thebes, but not as Euripides in his tragedy 
<A NAME="767"></A>says, by force of arms, but by persuasion and mutual agreement and composition, 
<A NAME="768"></A>for so the greater part of the historians write; Philochorus adds further 
<A NAME="769"></A>that this was the first treaty that ever was made for the recovering the 
<A NAME="770"></A>bodies of the dead, but in the history of Hercules, it is shown that it 
<A NAME="771"></A>was he who first gave leave to his enemies to carry off their slain. The 
<A NAME="772"></A>burying-places of the most part are yet to be seen in the villa called 
<A NAME="773"></A>Eleutherae; those of the commanders, at Eleusis, where Theseus allotted 
<A NAME="774"></A>them a place, to oblige Adrastus. The story of Euripides in his suppliants 
<A NAME="775"></A>is disproved by Aeschylus in his Eleusinians, where Theseus himself relates 
<A NAME="776"></A>the facts as here told.
<A NAME="777"></A><BR><BR>The celebrated friendship between Theseus and Pirithous is said 
<A NAME="778"></A>to have been thus began; the fame of the strength and valour of Theseus 
<A NAME="779"></A>being spread through Greece, Pirithous was desirous to make a trial and 
<A NAME="780"></A>proof of it himself, and to this end seized a herd of oxen which belonged 
<A NAME="781"></A>to Theseus, and was driving them away from Marathon, and, when the news 
<A NAME="782"></A>was brought that Theseus pursued him in arms, he did not fly, but turned 
<A NAME="783"></A>back and went to meet him. But as soon as they had viewed one another, 
<A NAME="784"></A>each so admired the gracefulness and beauty, and was seized with such respect 
<A NAME="785"></A>for the courage of the other, that they forgot all thoughts of fighting; 
<A NAME="786"></A>and Pirithous, first stretching out his hand to Theseus, bade him be judge 
<A NAME="787"></A>in this case himself, and promised to submit willingly to any penalty he 
<A NAME="788"></A>should impose. But Theseus not only forgave him all, but entreated him 
<A NAME="789"></A>to be his friend and brother in arms; and they ratified their friendship 
<A NAME="790"></A>by oaths. After this Pirithous married Deidamia, and invited Theseus to 
<A NAME="791"></A>the wedding, entreating him to come and see his country, and make acquaintance 
<A NAME="792"></A>with the Lapithae; he had at the same time invited the Centaurs to the 
<A NAME="793"></A>feast, who growing hot with wine and beginning to be insolent and wild, 
<A NAME="794"></A>and offering violence to the women, the Lapithae took immediate revenge 
<A NAME="795"></A>upon them, slaying many of them upon the place, and afterwards, having 
<A NAME="796"></A>overcome them in battle, drove the whole race of them out of their country, 
<A NAME="797"></A>Theseus all along taking their part and fighting on their side. But Herodorus 
<A NAME="798"></A>gives a different relation of these things; that Theseus came not to the 
<A NAME="799"></A>assistance of the Lapithae till the war was already begun; and that it 
<A NAME="800"></A>was in this journey that he had his first sight of Hercules, having made 
<A NAME="801"></A>it his business to find him out at Trachis, where he had chosen to rest 
<A NAME="802"></A>himself after all his wanderings and his labours; and that this interview 
<A NAME="803"></A>was honourably performed on each part, with extreme respect, and good-will, 
<A NAME="804"></A>and admiration of each other. Yet it is more credible, as others write, 
<A NAME="805"></A>that there were, before, frequent interviews between them, and that it 
<A NAME="806"></A>was by the means of Theseus that Hercules was initiated at Eleusis, and 
<A NAME="807"></A>purified before initiation, upon account of several rash actions of his 
<A NAME="808"></A>former life.
<A NAME="809"></A><BR><BR>Theseus was now fifty years old, as Hellanicus states, when he 
<A NAME="810"></A>carried off Helen, who was yet too young to be married. Some writers, to 
<A NAME="811"></A>take away this accusation of one of the greatest crimes laid to his charge, 
<A NAME="812"></A>say, that he did not steal away Helen himself, but that Idas and Lynceus 
<A NAME="813"></A>were the ravishers, who brought her to him, and committed her to his charge, 
<A NAME="814"></A>and that, therefore, he refused to restore her at the demand of Castor 
<A NAME="815"></A>and Pollux; or, indeed, they say her own father, Tyndarus, had sent her 
<A NAME="816"></A>to be kept by him, for fear of Enarophorus, the son of Hippocoon, who would 
<A NAME="817"></A>have carried her away by force when she was yet a child. But the most probable 
<A NAME="818"></A>account, and that which has most witnesses on its side, is this: Theseus 
<A NAME="819"></A>and Pirithous went both together to Sparta, and, having seized the young 
<A NAME="820"></A>lady as she was dancing in the temple Diana Orthia, fled away with her. 
<A NAME="821"></A>There were presently men sent in arms to pursue, but they followed no further 
<A NAME="822"></A>than to Tegea; and Theseus and Pirithous, being now out of danger, having 
<A NAME="823"></A>passed through Peloponnesus, made an agreement between themselves, that 
<A NAME="824"></A>he to whom the lot should fall should have Helen to his wife, but should 
<A NAME="825"></A>be obliged to assist in procuring another for his friend. The lot fell 
<A NAME="826"></A>upon Theseus, who conveyed her to Aphidnae, not being yet marriageable, 
<A NAME="827"></A>and delivered her to one of his allies, called Aphidnus, and, having sent 
<A NAME="828"></A>his mother, Aethra, after to take care of her, desired him to keep them 
<A NAME="829"></A>so secretly, that none might know where they were; which done, to return 
<A NAME="830"></A>the same service to his friend Pirithous, he accompanied him in his journey 
<A NAME="831"></A>to Epirus, in order to steal away the king of the Molossians' daughter. 
<A NAME="832"></A>The king, his own name being Aidoneus, or Pluto, called his wife Proserpina, 
<A NAME="833"></A>and his daughter Cora, and a great dog, which he kept, Cerberus, with whom 
<A NAME="834"></A>he ordered all that came as suitors to his daughter to fight, and promised 
<A NAME="835"></A>her to him that should overcome the beast. But having been informed that 
<A NAME="836"></A>the design of Pirithous and his companion was not to court his daughter, 
<A NAME="837"></A>but to force her away, he caused them both to be seized, and threw Pirithous 
<A NAME="838"></A>to be torn in pieces by his dog, and put Theseus into prison, and kept 
<A NAME="839"></A>him.
<A NAME="840"></A><BR><BR>About this time, Menestheus, the son of Peteus, grandson of Orneus, 
<A NAME="841"></A>and great-grandson of Erechtheus, the first man that is recorded to have 
<A NAME="842"></A>affected popularity and ingratiated himself with the multitude, stirred 
<A NAME="843"></A>up and exasperated the most eminent men of the city, who had long borne 
<A NAME="844"></A>a secret grudge to Theseus, conceiving that he had robbed them of their 
<A NAME="845"></A>several little kingdoms and lordships, and having pent them all up in one 
<A NAME="846"></A>city, was using them as his subjects and slaves. He put also the meaner 
<A NAME="847"></A>people into commotion, telling them, that, deluded with a mere dream of 
<A NAME="848"></A>liberty, though indeed they were deprived of both that and of their proper 
<A NAME="849"></A>homes and religious usages, instead of many good and gracious kings of 
<A NAME="850"></A>their own, they had given themselves up to be lorded over by a new-comer 
<A NAME="851"></A>and a stranger. Whilst he was thus busied in infecting the minds of the 
<A NAME="852"></A>citizens, the war that Castor and Pollux brought against Athens came very 
<A NAME="853"></A>opportunely to further the sedition he had been promoting, and some say 
<A NAME="854"></A>that by his persuasions was wholly the cause of their invading the city. 
<A NAME="855"></A>At their first approach, they committed no acts of hostility, but peaceably 
<A NAME="856"></A>demanded their sister Helen; but the Athenians returning answer that they 
<A NAME="857"></A>neither had her there nor knew where she was disposed of, they prepared 
<A NAME="858"></A>to assault the city, when Academus, having, by whatever means, found it 
<A NAME="859"></A>out, disclosed to them that she was secretly kept at Aphidnae. For which 
<A NAME="860"></A>reason he was both highly honoured during his life by Castor and Pollux, 
<A NAME="861"></A>and the Lacedaemonians, when often in aftertimes they made incursions into 
<A NAME="862"></A>Attica, and destroyed all the country round about, spared the Academy for 
<A NAME="863"></A>the sake of Academus. But Dicaearchus writes that there were two Arcadians 
<A NAME="864"></A>in the army of Castor and Pollux, the one called Echedemus, and the other 
<A NAME="865"></A>Marathus; from the first that which is now called Academia was then named 
<A NAME="866"></A>Echedemia, and the village Marathon had its name from the other, who, to 
<A NAME="867"></A>fulfil some oracle, voluntarily offered himself to be made a sacrifice 
<A NAME="868"></A>before battle. As soon as they were arrived at Aphidnae, they overcame 
<A NAME="869"></A>their enemies in a set battle, and then assaulted and took the town. And 
<A NAME="870"></A>here, they say, Alycus, the son of Sciron, was slain, of the party of the 
<A NAME="871"></A>Dioscuri (Castor and Pollux), from whom a place in Megara, where he was 
<A NAME="872"></A>buried, is called Alycus to this day. And Hereas writes that it was Theseus 
<A NAME="873"></A>himself that killed him, in witness of which he cites these verses concerning 
<A NAME="874"></A>Alycus-
<A NAME="875"></A><BR><BR>"And Alycus upon Aphidnae's plain,
<A NAME="876"></A><BR>By Theseus in the cause of Helen slain." Though it is not at all probable 
<A NAME="877"></A>that Theseus himself was there when both the city and his mother were 
<A NAME="878"></A>taken.
<A NAME="879"></A><BR><BR>Aphidnae being won by Castor and Pollux, and the city of Athens 
<A NAME="880"></A>being in consternation, Menestheus persuaded the people to open their gates, 
<A NAME="881"></A>and receive them with all manner of friendship, for they were, he told 
<A NAME="882"></A>them, at enmity with none but Theseus, who had first injured them, and 
<A NAME="883"></A>were benefactors and saviours to all mankind beside. And their behviour 
<A NAME="884"></A>gave credit to those promises; for, having made themselves absolute masters 
<A NAME="885"></A>of the place, they demanded no more than to be initiated, since they were 
<A NAME="886"></A>as nearly related to the city as Hercules was, who had received the same 
<A NAME="887"></A>honour. This their desire they easily obtained, and were adopted by Aphidnus, 
<A NAME="888"></A>as Hercules had been by Pylius. They were honoured also like gods, and 
<A NAME="889"></A>were called by a new name, Anaces, either from the cessation of the war, 
<A NAME="890"></A>or from the care they took that none should suffer any injury, though there 
<A NAME="891"></A>was so great an army within the walls; for the phrase anakos ekhein is 
<A NAME="892"></A>used of those who look to or care for anything; kings for this reason, 
<A NAME="893"></A>perhaps, are called anactes. Others say, that from the appearance of their 
<A NAME="894"></A>star in the heavens, they were thus called, for in the Attic dialect this 
<A NAME="895"></A>name comes very near the words that signify above.
<A NAME="896"></A><BR><BR>Some say that Aethra, Theseus's mother, was here taken prisoner, 
<A NAME="897"></A>and carried to Lacedaemon, and from thence went away with Helen to Troy, 
<A NAME="898"></A>alleging this verse of Homer to prove that she waited upon 
<A NAME="899"></A>Helen-
<A NAME="900"></A><BR><BR>"Aethra of Pittheus born, and large eyed Clymene." Others reject 
<A NAME="901"></A>this verse as none of Homer's, as they do likewise the whole fable of Munychus, 
<A NAME="902"></A>who, the story says, was the son of Demophon and Laodice, born secretly, 
<A NAME="903"></A>and brought up by Aethra at Troy. But Ister, in the thirteenth book of 
<A NAME="904"></A>his Attic History, gives us an account of Aethra, different yet from all 
<A NAME="905"></A>the rest: that Achilles and Patroclus overcame Paris in Thessaly, near 
<A NAME="906"></A>the river Sperchius, but that Hector took and plundered the city of the 
<A NAME="907"></A>Troezenians. and made Aethra prisoner there. But this seems a groundless 
<A NAME="908"></A>tale.
<A NAME="909"></A><BR><BR>Now Hercules, passing by the Molossians, was entertained in his 
<A NAME="910"></A>way to Aidoneus the king, who, in conversation, accidentally spoke of the 
<A NAME="911"></A>journey of Theseus and Pirithous into his country, of what they had designed 
<A NAME="912"></A>to do, and what they were forced to suffer. Hercules was much grieved for 
<A NAME="913"></A>the inglorious death of the one and the miserable condition of the other. 
<A NAME="914"></A>As for Pirithous, he thought it useless to complain; but begged to have 
<A NAME="915"></A>Theseus released for his sake, and obtained that favour from the king. 
<A NAME="916"></A>Theseus, being thus set at liberty, returned to Athens, where his friends 
<A NAME="917"></A>were not yet wholly suppressed, and dedicated to Hercules all the sacred 
<A NAME="918"></A>places which the city had set apart for himself, changing their names from 
<A NAME="919"></A>Thesea to Heraclea, four only excepted, as Philochorus writes. And wishing 
<A NAME="920"></A>immediately to resume the first place in the commonwealth, and manage the 
<A NAME="921"></A>state as before, he soon found himself involved in factions and troubles; 
<A NAME="922"></A>those who long had hated him had now added to their hatred contempt; and 
<A NAME="923"></A>the minds of the people were so generally corrupted, that, instead of obeying 
<A NAME="924"></A>commands with silence, they expected to be flattered into their duty. He 
<A NAME="925"></A>had some thoughts to have reduced them by force, but was overpowered by 
<A NAME="926"></A>demagogues and factions. And at last, despairing of any good success of 
<A NAME="927"></A>his affairs in Athens, he sent away his children privately to Euboea, commending 
<A NAME="928"></A>them to the care of Elephenor, the son of Chalcodon; and he himself having 
<A NAME="929"></A>solemnly cursed the people of Athens in the village of Gargettus, in which 
<A NAME="930"></A>there yet remains the place called Araterion, or the place of cursing, 
<A NAME="931"></A>sailed to Scyros, where he had lands left him by his father, and friendship, 
<A NAME="932"></A>as he thought, with those of the island. Lycomedes was then king of Scyros. 
<A NAME="933"></A>Theseus, therefore, addressed himself to him and desired to have his lands 
<A NAME="934"></A>put into his possession, as designing to settle and to dwell there, though 
<A NAME="935"></A>others say that he came to beg his assistance against the Athenians. But 
<A NAME="936"></A>Lycomedes, either jealous of the glory of so great a man, or to gratify 
<A NAME="937"></A>Menestheus, having led him up to the highest cliff of the island, on pretence 
<A NAME="938"></A>of showing him from thence the lands that be desired, threw him headlong 
<A NAME="939"></A>down from the rock, and killed him. Others say he fell down of himself 
<A NAME="940"></A>by a slip of his foot, as he was walking there, according to his custom, 
<A NAME="941"></A>after supper. At that time there was no notice taken, nor were any concerned 
<A NAME="942"></A>for his death, but Menestheus quietly possessed the kingdom of Athens. 
<A NAME="943"></A>His sons were brought up in a private condition, and accompanied Elephenor 
<A NAME="944"></A>to the Trojan war, but, after the decease of Menestheus in that expedition, 
<A NAME="945"></A>returned to Athens, and recovered the government. But in succeeding ages, 
<A NAME="946"></A>besides several other circumstances that moved the Athenians to honour 
<A NAME="947"></A>Theseus as a demigod, in the battle which was fought at Marathon against 
<A NAME="948"></A>the Medes, many of the soldiers believed they saw an apparition of Theseus 
<A NAME="949"></A>in arms, rushing on at the head of them against the barbarians. And after 
<A NAME="950"></A>the Median war, Phaedo being archon of Athens, the Athenians, consulting 
<A NAME="951"></A>the oracle at Delphi, were commanded to gather together the bones of Theseus, 
<A NAME="952"></A>and, laying them in some honourable place, keep them as sacred in the city. 
<A NAME="953"></A>But it was very difficult to recover those relics, or so much as to find 
<A NAME="954"></A>out the place where they lay, on account of the inhospitable and savage 
<A NAME="955"></A>temper of the barbarous people that inhabited the island. Nevertheless, 
<A NAME="956"></A>afterwards, when Cimon took the island (as is related in his life), and 
<A NAME="957"></A>had a great ambition to find out the place where Theseus was buried, he, 
<A NAME="958"></A>by chance, spied an eagle upon a rising ground pecking with her beak and 
<A NAME="959"></A>tearing up the earth with her talons, when on the sudden it came into his 
<A NAME="960"></A>mind, as it were by some divine inspiration, to dig there, and search for 
<A NAME="961"></A>the bones of Theseus. There were found in that place a coffin of a man 
<A NAME="962"></A>of more than ordinary size, and a brazen spear-head, and a sword lying 
<A NAME="963"></A>by it, all which he took aboard his galley and brought with him to Athens. 
<A NAME="964"></A>Upon which the Athenians, greatly delighted, went out to meet and receive 
<A NAME="965"></A>the relics with splendid processions and sacrifices, as if it were Theseus 
<A NAME="966"></A>himself returning alive to the city. He lies interred in the middle of 
<A NAME="967"></A>the city, near the present gymnasium. His tomb is a sanctuary and refuge 
<A NAME="968"></A>for slaves, and all those of mean condition that fly from the persecution 
<A NAME="969"></A>of men in power, in memory that Theseus while he lived was an assister 
<A NAME="970"></A>and protector of the distressed, and never refused the petitions of the 
<A NAME="971"></A>afflicted that fled to him. The chief and most solemn sacrifice which they 
<A NAME="972"></A>celebrate to him is kept on the eighth day of Pyanepsion, on which he returned 
<A NAME="973"></A>with the Athenian young men from Crete. Besides which they sacrifice to 
<A NAME="974"></A>him on the eighth day of every month, either because he returned from Troezen 
<A NAME="975"></A>the eighth day of Hecatombaeon, as Diodorus the geographer writes, or else 
<A NAME="976"></A>thinking that number to be proper to him, because he was reputed to be 
<A NAME="977"></A>born of Neptune, because they sacrifice to Neptune on the eighth day of 
<A NAME="978"></A>every month. The number eight being the first cube of an even number, and 
<A NAME="979"></A>the double of the first square, seemed to be an emblem of the steadfast 
<A NAME="980"></A>and immovable power of this god, who from thence has the names of Asphalius 
<A NAME="981"></A>and Gaeiochus, that is, the establisher and stayer of the 
<A NAME="982"></A>earth.
