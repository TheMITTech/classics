<BR>(legendary, died 7th century B.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Though the pedigrees of noble families of Rome go back in exact form as 
<A NAME="11"></A>far as Numa Pompilius, yet there is great diversity amongst historians 
<A NAME="12"></A>concerning the time in which he reigned; a certain writer called Clodius, 
<A NAME="13"></A>in a book of his entitled Strictures on Chronology, avers that the ancient 
<A NAME="14"></A>registers of Rome were lost when the city was sacked by the Gauls, and 
<A NAME="15"></A>that those which are now extant were counterfeited, to flatter and serve 
<A NAME="16"></A>the humour of some men who wished to have themselves derived from some 
<A NAME="17"></A>ancient and noble lineage, though in reality with no claim to it. And though 
<A NAME="18"></A>it be commonly reported that Numa was a scholar and a familiar acquaintance 
<A NAME="19"></A>of Pythagoras, yet it is again contradicted by others, who affirm that 
<A NAME="20"></A>he was acquainted with neither the Greek language nor learning, and that 
<A NAME="21"></A>he was a person of that natural talent and ability as of himself to attain 
<A NAME="22"></A>to virtue, or else that he found some barbarian instructor superior to 
<A NAME="23"></A>Pythagoras. Some affirm, also, that Pythagoras was not contemporary with 
<A NAME="24"></A>Numa, but lived at least five generations after him; and that some other 
<A NAME="25"></A>Pythagoras, a native of Sparta, who, in the sixteenth Olympiad, in the 
<A NAME="26"></A>third year of which Numa became king, won a prize at the Olympic race, 
<A NAME="27"></A>might, in his travel through Italy, have gained acquaintance with Numa, 
<A NAME="28"></A>and assisted him in the constitution of his kingdom; whence it comes that 
<A NAME="29"></A>many Laconian laws and customs appear amongst the Roman institutions. Yet, 
<A NAME="30"></A>in any case, Numa was descended of the Sabines, who declare themselves 
<A NAME="31"></A>to be a colony of the Lacedaemonians. And chronology, in general, is uncertain; 
<A NAME="32"></A>especially when fixed by the lists of victors in the Olympic games, which 
<A NAME="33"></A>were published at a late period by Hippias the Elean, and rest on no positive 
<A NAME="34"></A>authority. Commencing, however, at a convenient point, we will proceed 
<A NAME="35"></A>to give the most noticeable events that are recorded of the life of 
<A NAME="36"></A>Numa.
<A NAME="37"></A><BR><BR>It was the thirty-seventh year, counted from the foundation of 
<A NAME="38"></A>Rome, when Romulus, then reigning, did, on the fifth day of the month of 
<A NAME="39"></A>July, called the Caprotine Nones, offer a public sacrifice at the Goat's 
<A NAME="40"></A>Marsh, in presence of the senate and people of Rome. Suddenly the sky was 
<A NAME="41"></A>darkened, a thick cloud of storm and rain settled on the earth; the common 
<A NAME="42"></A>people fled in affright, and were dispersed; and in this whirlwind Romulus 
<A NAME="43"></A>disappeared, his body being never found either living or dead. A foul suspicion 
<A NAME="44"></A>presently attached to the patricians, and rumours were current among the 
<A NAME="45"></A>people as if that they, weary of kingly government, and exasperated of 
<A NAME="46"></A>late by the imperious deportment of Romulus towards them, had plotted against 
<A NAME="47"></A>his life and made him away, that so they might assume the authority and 
<A NAME="48"></A>government into their own hands. This suspicion they sought to turn aside 
<A NAME="49"></A>by decreeing divine honours to Romulus, as to one not dead but translated 
<A NAME="50"></A>to a higher condition. And Proculus, a man of note, took oath that he saw 
<A NAME="51"></A>Romulus caught up into heaven in his arms and vestments, and heard him, 
<A NAME="52"></A>as he ascended, cry out that they should hereafter style him by the name 
<A NAME="53"></A>of Quirinus.
<A NAME="54"></A><BR><BR>This trouble, being appeased, was followed by another, about the 
<A NAME="55"></A>election of a new king; for the minds of the original Romans and the new 
<A NAME="56"></A>inhabitants were not as yet grown into that perfect unity of temper, but 
<A NAME="57"></A>that there were diversities of factions amongst the commonalty and jealousies 
<A NAME="58"></A>and emulations amongst the senators; for though all agreed that it was 
<A NAME="59"></A>necessary to have a king, yet what person or of which nation was matter 
<A NAME="60"></A>of dispute. For those who had been builders of the city with Romulus, and 
<A NAME="61"></A>had already yielded a share of their lands and dwellings to the Sabines, 
<A NAME="62"></A>were indignant at any pretension on their part to rule over their benefactors. 
<A NAME="63"></A>On the other side, the Sabines could plausibly allege, that, at their king 
<A NAME="64"></A>Tatius's decease, they had peaceably submitted to the sole command of Romulus; 
<A NAME="65"></A>so now their turn was come to have a king chosen out of their own nation; 
<A NAME="66"></A>nor did they esteem themselves to have combined with the Romans as inferiors, 
<A NAME="67"></A>nor to have contributed less than they to the increase of Rome, which, 
<A NAME="68"></A>without their numbers and association, could scarcely have merited the 
<A NAME="69"></A>name of a city.
<A NAME="70"></A><BR><BR>Thus did both parties argue and dispute their cause; but lest meanwhile 
<A NAME="71"></A>discord, in the absence of all command, should occasion general confusion, 
<A NAME="72"></A>it was agreed that the hundred and fifty senators should interchangeably 
<A NAME="73"></A>execute the office of supreme magistrate, and each in succession, with 
<A NAME="74"></A>the ensigns of royalty, should offer the solemn sacrifices and despatch 
<A NAME="75"></A>public business for the space of six hours by day and six by night; which 
<A NAME="76"></A>vicissitude and equal distribution of power would preclude all rivalry 
<A NAME="77"></A>amongst the senators and envy from the people, when they should behold 
<A NAME="78"></A>one, elevated to the degree of a king, levelled within the space of a day 
<A NAME="79"></A>to the condition of a private citizen. This form of government is termed, 
<A NAME="80"></A>by the Romans, interregnum. Nor yet could they, by this plausible and modest 
<A NAME="81"></A>way of rule, escape suspicion and clamour of the vulgar, as though they 
<A NAME="82"></A>were changing the form of government to an oligarchy, and designing to 
<A NAME="83"></A>keep the supreme power in a sort of wardship under themselves, without 
<A NAME="84"></A>ever proceeding to choose a king. Both parties came at length to the conclusion 
<A NAME="85"></A>that the one should choose a king out of the body of the other; the Romans 
<A NAME="86"></A>make a choice of a Sabine, or the Sabines name a Roman; this was esteemed 
<A NAME="87"></A>the best expedient to put an end to all party spirit, and the prince who 
<A NAME="88"></A>should be chosen would have an equal affection to the one party as his 
<A NAME="89"></A>electors and to the other as his kinsmen. The Sabines remitted the choice 
<A NAME="90"></A>to the original Romans, and they, too, on their part, were more inclinable 
<A NAME="91"></A>to receive a Sabine king elected by themselves than to see a Roman exalted 
<A NAME="92"></A>by the Sabines. Consultations being accordingly held, they named Numa Pompilius, 
<A NAME="93"></A>of the Sabine race, a person of that high reputation for excellence, that, 
<A NAME="94"></A>though he were not actually residing at Rome, yet he was no sooner nominated 
<A NAME="95"></A>than accepted by the Sabines, with acclamation almost greater than that 
<A NAME="96"></A>of the electors themselves.
<A NAME="97"></A><BR><BR>The choice being declared and made known to the people, principal 
<A NAME="98"></A>men of both parties were appointed to visit and entreat him, that he would 
<A NAME="99"></A>accept the administration of the government. Numa resided at a famous city 
<A NAME="100"></A>of the Sabines called Cures, whence the Romans and Sabines gave themselves 
<A NAME="101"></A>the joint name of Quirites. Pomponius, an illustrious person, was his father, 
<A NAME="102"></A>and he the youngest of his four sons, being (as it had been divinely ordered) 
<A NAME="103"></A>born on the twenty-first day of April, the day of the foundation of Rome. 
<A NAME="104"></A>He was endued with a soul rarely tempered by nature, and disposed to virtue, 
<A NAME="105"></A>which he had yet more subdued by discipline, a severe life, and the study 
<A NAME="106"></A>of philosophy; means which had not only succeeded in expelling the baser 
<A NAME="107"></A>passions, but also the violent and rapacious temper which barbarians are 
<A NAME="108"></A>apt to think highly of; true bravery, in his judgment, was regarded as 
<A NAME="109"></A>consisting in the subjugation of our passions by reason.
<A NAME="110"></A><BR><BR>He banished all luxury and softness from his own home, and while 
<A NAME="111"></A>citizens alike and strangers found in him an incorruptible judge and counsellor, 
<A NAME="112"></A>in private he devoted himself not to amusement or lucre, but to the worship 
<A NAME="113"></A>of the immortal gods, and rational contemplation of their divine power 
<A NAME="114"></A>and nature. So famous was he, that Tatius, the colleague of Romulus, chose 
<A NAME="115"></A>him for his son-in-law, and gave him his only daughter, which, however, 
<A NAME="116"></A>did not stimulate his vanity to desire to dwell with his father-in-law 
<A NAME="117"></A>at Rome; he rather chose to inhabit with his Sabines, and cherish his own 
<A NAME="118"></A>father in his old age; and Tatia, also, preferred the private conditions 
<A NAME="119"></A>of her husband before the honours and splendour she might have enjoyed 
<A NAME="120"></A>with her father. She is said to have died after she had been married thirteen 
<A NAME="121"></A>years, and then Numa, leaving the conversation of the town, betook himself 
<A NAME="122"></A>to a country life, and in a solitary manner frequented the groves and fields 
<A NAME="123"></A>consecrated to the gods, passing his life in desert places. And this in 
<A NAME="124"></A>particular gave occasion to the story about the goddess, namely, that Numa 
<A NAME="125"></A>did not retire from human society out of any melancholy or disorder of 
<A NAME="126"></A>mind, but because he had tasted the joys of more elevated intercourse, 
<A NAME="127"></A>and, admitted to celestial wedlock in the love and converse of the goddess 
<A NAME="128"></A>Egeria, had attained to blessedness, and to a divine 
<A NAME="129"></A>wisdom.
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR>The story evidently resembles those very ancient fables which the 
<A NAME="131"></A>Phrygians have received and still recount of Attis, the Bithynians of Herodotus, 
<A NAME="132"></A>the Arcadians of Endymion, not to mention several others who were thought 
<A NAME="133"></A>blessed and beloved of the gods; nor does it seem strange if God, a lover, 
<A NAME="134"></A>not of horses or birds, but men, should not disdain to dwell with the virtuous 
<A NAME="135"></A>and converse with the wise and temperate soul, though it be altogether 
<A NAME="136"></A>hard, indeed, to believe, that any god or daemon is capable of a sensual 
<A NAME="137"></A>or bodily love and passion for any human form or beauty. Though, indeed, 
<A NAME="138"></A>the wise Egyptians do not plausibly make the distinction, that it may be 
<A NAME="139"></A>possible for a divine spirit so to apply itself to the nature of a woman, 
<A NAME="140"></A>as to imbreed in her the first beginnings of generation, while on the other 
<A NAME="141"></A>side they conclude it impossible for the male kind to have any intercourse 
<A NAME="142"></A>or mixture by the body with any divinity, not considering, however, that 
<A NAME="143"></A>what takes place on the one side must also take place on the other; intermixture, 
<A NAME="144"></A>by force of terms, is reciprocal. Not that it is otherwise than befitting 
<A NAME="145"></A>to suppose that the gods feel towards men affection, and love, in the sense 
<A NAME="146"></A>of affection, and in the form of care and solicitude for their virtue and 
<A NAME="147"></A>their good dispositions. And, therefore, it was no error of those who feigned, 
<A NAME="148"></A>that Phorbas, Hyacinthus, and Admetus were beloved by Apollo; or that Hippolytus 
<A NAME="149"></A>the Sicyonian was so much in his favour, that, as often as he sailed from 
<A NAME="150"></A>Sicyon to Cirrha, the Pythian prophetess uttered this heroic verse expressive 
<A NAME="151"></A>of the god's attention and joy:
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR>"Now doth Hippolytus return again,
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>And venture his dear life upon the main."
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR>It is reported, also, that Pan became enamoured of Pindar for his 
<A NAME="155"></A>verses, and the divine power rendered honour to Hesiod and Archilochus 
<A NAME="156"></A>after their death for the sake of the Muses; there is a statement, also, 
<A NAME="157"></A>that Aesculapius sojourned with Sophocles in his lifetime, of which many 
<A NAME="158"></A>proofs still exist, and that, when he was dead, another deity took care 
<A NAME="159"></A>for his funeral rites. And so if any credit may be given to these instances, 
<A NAME="160"></A>why should we judge it incongruous, that a like spirit of the gods should 
<A NAME="161"></A>visit Zaleucus, Minos, Zoroaster, Lycurgus, and Numa, the controllers of 
<A NAME="162"></A>kingdoms, and the legislators for commonwealths? Nay, it may be reasonable 
<A NAME="163"></A>to believe, that the gods, with a serious purpose, assist at the councils 
<A NAME="164"></A>and serious debates of such men, to inspire and direct them; and visit 
<A NAME="165"></A>poets and musicians, if at all in their more sportive moods; but for difference 
<A NAME="166"></A>of opinion here, as Bacchylides said, "the road is broad." For there is 
<A NAME="167"></A>no absurdity in the account also given, that Lycurgus and Numa, and other 
<A NAME="168"></A>famous lawgivers, having the task of subduing perverse and refractory multitudes, 
<A NAME="169"></A>and of introducing great innovations, themselves made this pretension to 
<A NAME="170"></A>divine authority, which, if not true, assuredly was expedient for the interests 
<A NAME="171"></A>of those it imposed upon.
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR>Numa was about forty years of age when the ambassadors came to 
<A NAME="173"></A>make him offers of the kingdom; the speakers were Proculus and Velesus, 
<A NAME="174"></A>one or other of whom it had been thought the people would elect as their 
<A NAME="175"></A>new king; the original Romans being for Proculus, and the Sabines for Velesus. 
<A NAME="176"></A>Their speech was very short, supposing that, when they came to tender a 
<A NAME="177"></A>kingdom, there needed little to persuade to an acceptance; but, contrary 
<A NAME="178"></A>to their expectations, they found that they had to use many reasons and 
<A NAME="179"></A>entreaties to induce one, that lived in peace and quietness, to accept 
<A NAME="180"></A>the government of a city whose foundation and increase had been made, in 
<A NAME="181"></A>a manner, in war. In presence of his father and his kinsman Marcius he 
<A NAME="182"></A>returned answer that "Every alteration of a man's life is dangerous to 
<A NAME="183"></A>him; but madness only could induce one who needs nothing, and is satisfied 
<A NAME="184"></A>with everything, to quit a life he is accustomed to; which, whatever else 
<A NAME="185"></A>it is deficient in, at any rate has the advantage of certainty over one 
<A NAME="186"></A>wholly doubtful and unknown. Though, indeed, the difficulties of this government 
<A NAME="187"></A>cannot even be called unknown; Romulus, who first held it, did not escape 
<A NAME="188"></A>the suspicion of having plotted against the life of his colleague Tatius; 
<A NAME="189"></A>nor the senate the like accusation, of having treasonably murdered Romulus. 
<A NAME="190"></A>Yet Romulus had the advantage to be thought divinely born and miraculously 
<A NAME="191"></A>preserved and nurtured. My birth was mortal; I was reared and instructed 
<A NAME="192"></A>by men that are known to you. The very points of my character that are 
<A NAME="193"></A>most commended mark me as unfit to reign, love of retirement and of studies 
<A NAME="194"></A>inconsistent with business, a passion that has become inveterate in me 
<A NAME="195"></A>for peace, for unwarlike occupations, and for the society of men whose 
<A NAME="196"></A>meetings are but those of worship and of kindly intercourse, whose lives 
<A NAME="197"></A>in general are spent upon their farms and their pastures. I should but 
<A NAME="198"></A>be, methinks, a laughingstock, while I should go about to inculcate the 
<A NAME="199"></A>worship of the gods and give lessons in the love of justice and the abhorrence 
<A NAME="200"></A>of violence and war, to a city whose needs are rather for a captain than 
<A NAME="201"></A>for a king."
<A NAME="202"></A><BR><BR>The Romans, perceiving by these words that he was declining to 
<A NAME="203"></A>accept the kingdom, were the more instant and urgent with him that he would 
<A NAME="204"></A>not forsake and desert them in this condition, and suffer them to relapse, 
<A NAME="205"></A>as they must, into their former sedition and civil discord, there being 
<A NAME="206"></A>no person on whom both parties could accord but on himself. And, at length, 
<A NAME="207"></A>his father and Marcius, taking him aside, persuaded him to accept a gift 
<A NAME="208"></A>so noble in itself, and tendered to him rather from heaven than from men. 
<A NAME="209"></A>"Though," said they, "you neither desire riches, being content with what 
<A NAME="210"></A>you have, nor court the fame of authority, as having already the more valuable 
<A NAME="211"></A>fame of virtue, yet you will consider that government itself is a service 
<A NAME="212"></A>of God, who now calls out into action your qualities of justice and wisdom, 
<A NAME="213"></A>which were not meant to be left useless and unemployed. Cease, therefore, 
<A NAME="214"></A>to avoid and turn your back upon an office which, to a wise man, is a field 
<A NAME="215"></A>for great and honourable actions, for the magnificent worship of the gods, 
<A NAME="216"></A>and for the introduction of habits of piety, which authority alone can 
<A NAME="217"></A>effect amongst a people. Tatius, though a foreigner, was beloved, and the 
<A NAME="218"></A>memory of Romulus has received divine honours; and who knows but that this 
<A NAME="219"></A>people, being victorious, may be satiated with war, and, content with the 
<A NAME="220"></A>trophies and spoils they have acquired, may be, above all things, desirous 
<A NAME="221"></A>to have a pacific and justice-loving prince to lead them to good order 
<A NAME="222"></A>and quiet? But if, indeed, their desires are uncontrollably and madly set 
<A NAME="223"></A>on war, were it not better, then, to have the reins held by such a moderating 
<A NAME="224"></A>hand as is able to divert the fury another way, and that your native city 
<A NAME="225"></A>and the whole Sabine nation should possess in you a bond of goodwill and 
<A NAME="226"></A>friendship with this young and growing power?"
<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR>With these reasons and persuasions several auspicious omens are 
<A NAME="228"></A>said to have concurred, and the zeal, also, of his fellow-citizens, who, 
<A NAME="229"></A>on understanding what message the Roman ambassadors had brought him, entreated 
<A NAME="230"></A>him to accompany them, and to accept the kingdom as a means to unanimity 
<A NAME="231"></A>and concord between the nations.
<A NAME="232"></A><BR><BR>Numa, yielding to these inducements, having first performed divine 
<A NAME="233"></A>sacrifice, proceeded to Rome, being met in his way by the senate and people, 
<A NAME="234"></A>who, with an impatient desire, came forth to receive him; the women, also, 
<A NAME="235"></A>welcomed him with joyful acclamations, and sacrifices were offered for 
<A NAME="236"></A>him in all the temples, and so universal was the joy, that they seemed 
<A NAME="237"></A>to be receiving, not a new king, but a new kingdom. In this manner he descended 
<A NAME="238"></A>into the forum, where Spurius Vettius, whose turn it was to be interrex 
<A NAME="239"></A>at that hour, put it to the vote; and all declared him king. Then the regalities 
<A NAME="240"></A>and robes of authority were brought to him; but he refused to be invested 
<A NAME="241"></A>with them until he had first consulted and been confirmed by the gods; 
<A NAME="242"></A>so being accompanied by the priests and augurs, he ascended the Capitol, 
<A NAME="243"></A>which at that time the Romans called the Tarpeian Hill. Then the chief 
<A NAME="244"></A>of the augurs covered Numa's head, and turned his face towards the south, 
<A NAME="245"></A>and, standing behind him, laid his right hand on his head, and prayed, 
<A NAME="246"></A>turning his eyes every way, in expectation of some auspicious signal from 
<A NAME="247"></A>the gods. It was wonderful, meantime, with what silence and devotion the 
<A NAME="248"></A>multitude stood assembled in the forum, in similar expectation and suspense, 
<A NAME="249"></A>till auspicious birds appeared and passed on the right. Then Numa, apparelling 
<A NAME="250"></A>himself in his royal robes, descended from the hill to the people, by whom 
<A NAME="251"></A>he was received and congratulated with shouts and acclamations of welcome, 
<A NAME="252"></A>as a holy king, and beloved of all the gods.
<A NAME="253"></A><BR><BR>The first thing he did at his entrance into government was to dismiss 
<A NAME="254"></A>the band of three hundred men which had been Romulus's life-guard, called 
<A NAME="255"></A>by him Celeres, saying that he would not distrust those who put confidence 
<A NAME="256"></A>in him; nor rule over a people that distrusted him. The next thing he did 
<A NAME="257"></A>was to add to the two priests of Jupiter and Mars a third, in honour of 
<A NAME="258"></A>Romulus, whom he called the Flamen Quirinalis. The Romans anciently called 
<A NAME="259"></A>their priests Flamines, by corruption of the word Pilamines, from a certain 
<A NAME="260"></A>cap which they wore, called Pileus. In those times Greek words were more 
<A NAME="261"></A>mixed with the Latin than at present; thus also the royal robe, which is 
<A NAME="262"></A>called, Laena, Juba says, is the same as the Greek Chlaena; and that the 
<A NAME="263"></A>name of Camillus, given to the boy with both his parents living, who serves 
<A NAME="264"></A>in the temple of Jupiter, was taken from the name given by some Greeks 
<A NAME="265"></A>to Mercury, denoting his office of attendance on the 
<A NAME="266"></A>gods.
<A NAME="267"></A><BR><BR>When Numa had, by such measures, won the favour and affection of 
<A NAME="268"></A>the people, he set himself without delay to the task of bringing the hard 
<A NAME="269"></A>and iron Roman temper to somewhat more of gentleness and equity. Plato's 
<A NAME="270"></A>expression of a city in high fever was never more applicable than to Rome 
<A NAME="271"></A>at that time; in its origin formed by daring and warlike spirits, whom 
<A NAME="272"></A>bold and desperate adventure brought thither from every quarter, it had 
<A NAME="273"></A>found in perpetual wars and incursions on its neighbours its after sustenance 
<A NAME="274"></A>and means of growth, and in conflict with danger the source of new strength; 
<A NAME="275"></A>like piles, which the blows of the hammer serve to fix into the ground. 
<A NAME="276"></A>Wherefore Numa, judging it no slight undertaking to mollify and bend to 
<A NAME="277"></A>peace the presumptuous and stubborn spirits of this people, began to operate 
<A NAME="278"></A>upon them with the sanctions of religion. He sacrificed often and used 
<A NAME="279"></A>processions and religious dances, in which most commonly he officiated 
<A NAME="280"></A>in person; by such combinations of solemnity with refined and humanizing 
<A NAME="281"></A>pleasures, seeking to win over and mitigate their fiery and warlike tempers. 
<A NAME="282"></A>At times, also, he filled their imaginations with religious terrors, professing 
<A NAME="283"></A>that strange apparitions had been seen, and dreadful voices heard; thus 
<A NAME="284"></A>subduing and humbling their minds by a sense of supernatural 
<A NAME="285"></A>fears.
<A NAME="286"></A><BR><BR>This method which Numa used made it believed that he had been much 
<A NAME="287"></A>conversant with Pythagoras; for in the philosophy of the one, as in the 
<A NAME="288"></A>policy of the other, man's relations to the deity occupy a great place. 
<A NAME="289"></A>It is said, also, that the solemnity of his exterior garb and gestures 
<A NAME="290"></A>was adopted by him from the same feeling with Pythagoras. For it is said 
<A NAME="291"></A>of Pythagoras, that he had taught an eagle to come at his call, and stoop 
<A NAME="292"></A>down to him in his flight; and that, as he passed among the people assembled 
<A NAME="293"></A>at the Olympic games, he showed them his golden thigh; besides many other 
<A NAME="294"></A>strange and miraculous seeming practices, on which Timon the Philasian 
<A NAME="295"></A>wrote the distich-
<A NAME="296"></A><BR><BR>"Who, of the glory of a juggler proud,
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>With solemn talk imposed upon the crowd."
<A NAME="298"></A><BR><BR>In like manner Numa spoke of a certain goddess or mountain nymph 
<A NAME="299"></A>that was in love with him, and met him in secret, as before related; and 
<A NAME="300"></A>professed that he entertained familiar conversation with the Muses, to 
<A NAME="301"></A>whose teaching he ascribed the greatest part of his revelations; and amongst 
<A NAME="302"></A>them, above all, he recommended to the veneration of the Romans one in 
<A NAME="303"></A>particular, whom he named Tacita, the silent; which he did perhaps in imitation 
<A NAME="304"></A>and honour of the Pythagorean silence. His opinion, also, of images is 
<A NAME="305"></A>very agreeable to the doctrine of Pythagoras; who conceived of the first 
<A NAME="306"></A>principle of being as transcending sense and passion, invisible and incorrupt, 
<A NAME="307"></A>and only to be apprehended by abstract intelligence. So Numa forbade the 
<A NAME="308"></A>Romans to represent God in the form of man or beast, nor was there any 
<A NAME="309"></A>painted or graven image of a deity admitted amongst them for the space 
<A NAME="310"></A>of the first hundred and seventy years, all of which time their temples 
<A NAME="311"></A>and chapels were kept free and pure from images; to such baser objects 
<A NAME="312"></A>they deemed it impious to liken the highest, and all access to God impossible, 
<A NAME="313"></A>except by the pure act of the intellect. His sacrifices, also, had great 
<A NAME="314"></A>similitude to the ceremonial of Pythagoras, for they were not celebrated 
<A NAME="315"></A>with effusion of blood, but consisted of flour, wine, and the least costly 
<A NAME="316"></A>offerings. Other external proofs, too, are urged to show the connection 
<A NAME="317"></A>Numa had with Pythagoras. The comic writer Epicharmus, an ancient author, 
<A NAME="318"></A>and of the school of Pythagoras, in a book of his dedicated to Antenor, 
<A NAME="319"></A>records that Pythagoras was made a freeman of Rome. Again, Numa gave to 
<A NAME="320"></A>one of his four sons the name of Mamercus, which was the name of one of 
<A NAME="321"></A>the sons of Pythagoras; from whence, as they say, sprang that ancient patrician 
<A NAME="322"></A>family of the Aemilli, for that the king gave him in sport the surname 
<A NAME="323"></A>of Aemilius, for his engaging and graceful manner in speaking. I remember, 
<A NAME="324"></A>too, that when I was at Rome, I heard many say, that, when the oracle directed 
<A NAME="325"></A>two statues to be raised, one to the wisest and another to the most valiant 
<A NAME="326"></A>man in Greece, they erected two of brass, one representing Alcibiades, 
<A NAME="327"></A>and the other Pythagoras.
<A NAME="328"></A><BR><BR>But to pass by these matters, which are full of uncertainty and 
<A NAME="329"></A>not so important as to be worth our time to insist on them, the original 
<A NAME="330"></A>constitution of the priests, called Pontifices, is ascribed unto Numa, 
<A NAME="331"></A>and he himself was, it is said, the first of them; and that they have the 
<A NAME="332"></A>name of Pontifices from potens, powerful, because they attend the service 
<A NAME="333"></A>of the gods, who have power to command over all. Others make the word refer 
<A NAME="334"></A>to exceptions of impossible cases; the priests were to perform all the 
<A NAME="335"></A>duties possible to them; if anything lay beyond their power, the exception 
<A NAME="336"></A>was not to be cavilled at. The most common opinion is the most absurd, 
<A NAME="337"></A>which derives this word from pons, and assigns the priests the title of 
<A NAME="338"></A>bridge-makers. The sacrifices performed on the bridge were amongst the 
<A NAME="339"></A>most sacred and ancient, and the keeping and repairing of the bridge attached, 
<A NAME="340"></A>like any other public sacred office, to the priesthood. It was accounted 
<A NAME="341"></A>not simply unlawful, but a positive sacrilege, to pull down the wooden 
<A NAME="342"></A>bridge; which moreover is said, in obedience to an oracle, to have been 
<A NAME="343"></A>built entirely of timber and fastened with wooden pins, without nails or 
<A NAME="344"></A>cramps of iron. The stone bridge was built a very long time after when 
<A NAME="345"></A>Aemilius was quaestor, and they do, indeed, say also that the wooden bridge 
<A NAME="346"></A>was not so old as Numa's time, but was finished by Ancus Marcius, when 
<A NAME="347"></A>he was king, who was the grandson of Numa by his daughter.
<A NAME="348"></A><BR><BR>The office of Pontifex Maximus, or chief priest, was to declare 
<A NAME="349"></A>and interpret the divine law, or, rather, to preside over sacred rites; 
<A NAME="350"></A>he not only prescribed rules for public ceremony, but regulated the sacrifices 
<A NAME="351"></A>of private persons, not suffering them to vary from established custom, 
<A NAME="352"></A>and giving information to every one of what was requisite for purposes 
<A NAME="353"></A>of worship or supplication. He was also guardian of the vestal virgins, 
<A NAME="354"></A>the institution of whom, and of their perpetual fire, was attributed to 
<A NAME="355"></A>Numa, who, perhaps, fancied the charge of pure and uncorrupted flames would 
<A NAME="356"></A>be fitly intrusted to chaste and unpolluted persons, or that fire, which 
<A NAME="357"></A>consumes, but produces nothing, bears an analogy to the virgin estate. 
<A NAME="358"></A>In Greece, wherever a perpetual holy fire is kept, as at Delphi and Athens 
<A NAME="359"></A>the charge of it is committed, not to virgins, but widows past the time 
<A NAME="360"></A>of marriage. And in case by any accident it should happen that this fire 
<A NAME="361"></A>became extinct, as the holy lamp was at Athens under the tyranny of Aristion, 
<A NAME="362"></A>and at Delphi, when that temple was burnt by the Medes, as also in the 
<A NAME="363"></A>time of the Mithridatic and Roman civil war, when not only the fire was 
<A NAME="364"></A>extinguished, but the altar demolished, then, afterwards, in kindling this 
<A NAME="365"></A>fire again, it was esteemed an impiety to light it from common sparks or 
<A NAME="366"></A>flame, or from anything but the pure and unpolluted rays of the sun, which 
<A NAME="367"></A>they usually effect by concave mirrors, of a figure formed by the revolution 
<A NAME="368"></A>of an isosceles rectangular triangle, all the lines from the circumference 
<A NAME="369"></A>of which meeting in a centre, by holding it in the light of the sun they 
<A NAME="370"></A>can collect and concentrate all its rays at this one point of convergence; 
<A NAME="371"></A>where the air will now become rarefied, and any light, dry, combustible 
<A NAME="372"></A>matter will kindle as soon as applied, under the effect of the rays, which 
<A NAME="373"></A>here acquired the substance and active force of fire. Some are of opinion 
<A NAME="374"></A>that these vestals had no other business than the preservation of this 
<A NAME="375"></A>fire; but others conceive that they were keepers of other divine secrets 
<A NAME="376"></A>concealed from all but themselves, of which we have told all that may lawfully 
<A NAME="377"></A>be asked or told, in the life of Camillus. Gegania and Verenia, it is recorded, 
<A NAME="378"></A>were the names of the first two virgins consecrated and ordained by Numa; 
<A NAME="379"></A>Canuleia and Tarpeia succeeded: Servius afterwards added two, and the number 
<A NAME="380"></A>of four has continued the present time.
<A NAME="381"></A><BR><BR>The statutes prescribed by Numa for the vestals were these: that 
<A NAME="382"></A>they should take a vow of virginity for the space of thirty years, the 
<A NAME="383"></A>first ten of which they were to spend in learning their duties, the second 
<A NAME="384"></A>ten in performing them, and the remaining ten in teaching and instructing 
<A NAME="385"></A>others. Thus the whole term being completed, it was lawful for them to 
<A NAME="386"></A>marry, and, leaving the sacred order, to choose any condition of life that 
<A NAME="387"></A>pleased them; but this permission few, as they say, made use of; and in 
<A NAME="388"></A>cases where they did so, it was observed that their change was not a happy 
<A NAME="389"></A>one, but accompanied ever after with regret and melancholy; so that the 
<A NAME="390"></A>greater number, from religious fears and scruples, forbore, and continued 
<A NAME="391"></A>to old age and death in the strict observance of a single 
<A NAME="392"></A>life.
<A NAME="393"></A><BR><BR>For this condition he compensated by great privileges and prerogatives; 
<A NAME="394"></A>as that they had power to make a will in the lifetime of their father; 
<A NAME="395"></A>that they had a free administration of their own affairs without guardian 
<A NAME="396"></A>or tutor, which was the privilege of women who were the mothers of three 
<A NAME="397"></A>children; when they go abroad, they have the fasces carried before them; 
<A NAME="398"></A>and if in their walks they chance to meet a criminal on his way to execution, 
<A NAME="399"></A>it saves his life, upon oath made that the meeting was an accidental one, 
<A NAME="400"></A>and not concerted or of set purpose. Any one who presses upon the chair 
<A NAME="401"></A>on which they are carried, is put to death. If these vestals commit any 
<A NAME="402"></A>minor fault, they are punishable by the high priest only, who scourges 
<A NAME="403"></A>the offender, sometimes with her clothes off, in a dark place, with a curtain 
<A NAME="404"></A>drawn between; but she that has broken her vow is buried alive near the 
<A NAME="405"></A>gate called Collina, where a little mound of earth stands inside the city, 
<A NAME="406"></A>reaching some little distance, called in Latin agger; under it a narrow 
<A NAME="407"></A>room is constructed, to which a descent is made by stairs; here they prepare 
<A NAME="408"></A>a bed, and light a lamp, and leave a small quantity of victuals, such as 
<A NAME="409"></A>bread, water, a pail of milk, and some oil; that so that body which had 
<A NAME="410"></A>been consecrated and devoted to the most sacred service of religion might 
<A NAME="411"></A>not be said to perish by such a death as famine. The culprit herself is 
<A NAME="412"></A>put in a litter, which they cover over, and tie her down with cords on 
<A NAME="413"></A>it, so that nothing she utters may be heard. They then take her to the 
<A NAME="414"></A>forum; all people silently go out of the way as she passes, and such as 
<A NAME="415"></A>follow accompany the bier with solemn and speechless sorrow; and indeed, 
<A NAME="416"></A>there is not any spectacle more appalling, nor any day observed by the 
<A NAME="417"></A>city with greater appearance of gloom and sadness. When they come to the 
<A NAME="418"></A>place of execution, the officers loose the cords, and then the high priest, 
<A NAME="419"></A>lifting his hands to heaven, pronounces certain prayers to himself before 
<A NAME="420"></A>the act; then he brings out the prisoner, being still covered, and placing 
<A NAME="421"></A>her upon the steps that lead down to the cell, turns away his face with 
<A NAME="422"></A>the rest of the priests; the stairs are drawn up after she has gone down, 
<A NAME="423"></A>and a quantity of earth is heaped up over the entrance to the cell, so 
<A NAME="424"></A>as to prevent it from being distinguished from the rest of the mound. This 
<A NAME="425"></A>is the punishment of those who break their vow of virginity.
<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR>It is said, also, that Numa built the temple of Vesta, which was 
<A NAME="427"></A>intended for a repository of the holy fire, of a circular form, not to 
<A NAME="428"></A>represent the figure of the earth, as if that were the same as Vesta, but 
<A NAME="429"></A>that of the general universe, in the centre of which the Pythagoreans place 
<A NAME="430"></A>the element of fire, and give it the name of Vesta and the unit; and do 
<A NAME="431"></A>not hold that the earth is immovable, or that it is situated in the centre 
<A NAME="432"></A>of the globe, but that it keeps a circular motion about the seat of fire, 
<A NAME="433"></A>and is not in the number of the primary elements; in this agreeing with 
<A NAME="434"></A>the opinion of Plato, who, they say, in his later life, conceived that 
<A NAME="435"></A>the earth held a lateral position, and that the central and sovereign space 
<A NAME="436"></A>was reserved for some nobler body.
<A NAME="437"></A><BR><BR>There was yet a farther use of the priests, and that was to give 
<A NAME="438"></A>people directions in the national usages at funeral rites. Numa taught 
<A NAME="439"></A>them to regard these offices, not as a pollution, but as a duty paid to 
<A NAME="440"></A>the gods below, into whose hands the better part of us is transmitted; 
<A NAME="441"></A>especially they were to worship the goddess Libitina, who presided over 
<A NAME="442"></A>all the ceremonies performed at burials; whether they meant hereby Proserpina, 
<A NAME="443"></A>or, as the most learned of the Romans conceive, Venus, not inaptly attributing 
<A NAME="444"></A>the beginning and end of man's life to the agency of one and the same diety. 
<A NAME="445"></A>Numa also prescribed rules for regulating the days of mourning, according 
<A NAME="446"></A>to certain times and ages. As, for example, a child of three years was 
<A NAME="447"></A>not to be mourned for at all; one older, up to ten years, for as many months 
<A NAME="448"></A>as it was years old; and the longest time of mourning for any person whatsoever 
<A NAME="449"></A>was not to exceed the term of ten months; which was the time appointed 
<A NAME="450"></A>for women that lost their husbands to continue in widowhood. If any married 
<A NAME="451"></A>again before that time, by the laws of Numa, she was to sacrifice a cow 
<A NAME="452"></A>big with calf.
<A NAME="453"></A><BR><BR>Numa, also, was founder of several other orders of priests, two 
<A NAME="454"></A>of which I shall mention, the Salii and the Fecials, which are among the 
<A NAME="455"></A>clearest proofs of the devoutness and sanctity of his character. These 
<A NAME="456"></A>Fecials, or guardians of peace, seem to have had their name from their 
<A NAME="457"></A>office, which was to put a stop to disputes by conference and speech; for 
<A NAME="458"></A>it was not allowable to take up arms until they had declared all hopes 
<A NAME="459"></A>of accommodation to be at an end, for in Greek, too, we call it peace when 
<A NAME="460"></A>disputes are settled by words, and not by force. The Romans commonly despatched 
<A NAME="461"></A>the Fecials, or heralds, to those who had offered them injury, requesting 
<A NAME="462"></A>satisfaction; and, in case they refused, they then called the gods to witness, 
<A NAME="463"></A>and, with imprecations upon themselves and their country should they be 
<A NAME="464"></A>acting unjustly, so declared war; against their will, or without their 
<A NAME="465"></A>consent, it was lawful neither for soldier nor king to take up arms; the 
<A NAME="466"></A>war was begun with them, and when they had first handed it over to the 
<A NAME="467"></A>commander as a just quarrel, then his business was to deliberate of the 
<A NAME="468"></A>manner and ways to carry it on. It is believed that the slaughter and destruction 
<A NAME="469"></A>which the Gauls made of the Romans was a judgment on the city for neglect 
<A NAME="470"></A>of this religious proceeding; for that when these barbarians besieged the 
<A NAME="471"></A>Clusinians, Fabius Ambustus was despatched to their camp to negotiate peace 
<A NAME="472"></A>for the besieged; and, on their returning a rude refusal, Fabius imagined 
<A NAME="473"></A>that his office of ambassador was at an end, and, rashly engaging on the 
<A NAME="474"></A>side of the Clusinians, challenged the bravest of the enemy to a single 
<A NAME="475"></A>combat. It was the fortune of Fabius to kill his adversary, and to take 
<A NAME="476"></A>his spoils; but when the Gauls discovered it, they sent a herald to Rome 
<A NAME="477"></A>to complain against him; since, before war was declared, he had, against 
<A NAME="478"></A>the law of nations, made a breach of the peace. The matter being debated 
<A NAME="479"></A>in the senate, the Fecials were of opinion that Fabius ought to be consigned 
<A NAME="480"></A>into the hands of the Gauls; but he, being forewarned of their judgment, 
<A NAME="481"></A>fled to the people, by whose protection and favour he escaped the sentence. 
<A NAME="482"></A>On this, the Gauls marched with their army to Rome, where having taken 
<A NAME="483"></A>the capitol, they sacked the city. The particulars of all which are fully 
<A NAME="484"></A>given in the history of Camillus.
<A NAME="485"></A><BR><BR>The origin of the Salii is this. In the eighth year of the reign 
<A NAME="486"></A>of Numa, a terrible pestilence, which traversed all Italy, ravaged likewise 
<A NAME="487"></A>the city of Rome; and the citizens being in distress and despondent, a 
<A NAME="488"></A>brazen target, they say, fell from heaven into hands of Numa, who gave 
<A NAME="489"></A>them this marvellous account of it: that Egeria and the Muses had assured 
<A NAME="490"></A>him it was sent from heaven for the cure and safety of the city, and that, 
<A NAME="491"></A>to keep it secure, he was ordered by them to make eleven others, so like 
<A NAME="492"></A>in dimensions and form to the original that no thief should be able to 
<A NAME="493"></A>distinguish the true from the counterfeit. He farther declared, that he 
<A NAME="494"></A>was commanded to consecrate to the Muses the place, and the fields about 
<A NAME="495"></A>it, where they had been chiefly wont to meet with him, and that the spring 
<A NAME="496"></A>which watered the fields should be hallowed for the use of the vestal virgins, 
<A NAME="497"></A>who were to wash and cleanse the penetralia of their sanctuary with those 
<A NAME="498"></A>holy waters. The truth of all which was speedily verified by the cessation 
<A NAME="499"></A>of the pestilence. Numa displayed the target to the artificers and bade 
<A NAME="500"></A>them show their skill in making others like it; all despaired, until at 
<A NAME="501"></A>length one Mamurius Veturius, an excellent workman, happily hit upon it, 
<A NAME="502"></A>and made all so exactly the same that Numa himself was at a loss and could 
<A NAME="503"></A>not distinguish. The keeping of these targets was committed to the charge 
<A NAME="504"></A>of certain priests, called Salii, who did not receive their name, as some 
<A NAME="505"></A>tell the story, from Salius, a dancing-master, born in Samothrace, or at 
<A NAME="506"></A>Mantinea who taught the way of dancing in arms; but more truly from that 
<A NAME="507"></A>jumping dance which the Salii themselves use, when in the month of March 
<A NAME="508"></A>they carry the sacred targets through the city; at which procession they 
<A NAME="509"></A>are habited in short frocks of purple, girt with a broad belt studded with 
<A NAME="510"></A>brass; on their heads they wear a brass helmet and carry in their hands 
<A NAME="511"></A>short daggers, which they clash every now and then against the targets. 
<A NAME="512"></A>But the chief thing is the dance itself. They move with much grace, performing, 
<A NAME="513"></A>in quick time and close order, various intricate figures, with a great 
<A NAME="514"></A>display of strength and agility. The targets were called Ancilia from their 
<A NAME="515"></A>form; for they are not made round, nor like proper targets, of a complete 
<A NAME="516"></A>circumference, but are cut out into a wavy line, the ends of which are 
<A NAME="517"></A>rounded off and turned in at the thickest part towards each other; so that 
<A NAME="518"></A>their shape is curvilinear, or, in Greek, ancylon; or the name may come 
<A NAME="519"></A>from ancon, the elbow, on which they are carried. Thus Juba writes, who 
<A NAME="520"></A>is eager to make it Greek. But it might be, for that matter, from its having 
<A NAME="521"></A>come down anecathen, from above; or from its akesis, or cure of diseases; 
<A NAME="522"></A>or auchmon lysis, because it put an end to a drought; or from its anaschesis, 
<A NAME="523"></A>or relief from calamities, which is the origin of the Athenian name Anaces, 
<A NAME="524"></A>given to Castor and Pollux; if we must, that is, reduce it to Greek. The 
<A NAME="525"></A>reward which Mamurius received for his art was to be mentioned and commemorated 
<A NAME="526"></A>in the verses which the Salii sang, as they danced in their arms through 
<A NAME="527"></A>the city; though some will have it that they do not say Veturium Mamuium, 
<A NAME="528"></A>but Veterem Memoriam, ancient remembrance.
<A NAME="529"></A><BR><BR>After Numa had in this manner instituted these several orders of 
<A NAME="530"></A>priests, he erected, near the temple of Vesta, what is called to this day 
<A NAME="531"></A>Regia, or king's house, where he spent the most part of his time performing 
<A NAME="532"></A>divine service, instructing the priests, or conversing with them on sacred 
<A NAME="533"></A>subjects. He had another house upon the Mount Quirinalis, the site of which 
<A NAME="534"></A>they show to this day. In all public processions and solemn prayers, criers 
<A NAME="535"></A>were sent before to give notice to the people that they should forbear 
<A NAME="536"></A>their work, and rest. They say that the Pythagoreans did not allow people 
<A NAME="537"></A>to worship and pray to their gods by the way, but would have them go out 
<A NAME="538"></A>from their houses direct, with their minds set upon the duty, and Numa, 
<A NAME="539"></A>in like manner, wished that his citizens should neither see nor hear any 
<A NAME="540"></A>religious service in a perfunctory and inattentive manner, but, laying 
<A NAME="541"></A>aside all other occupations, should apply their minds to religion as to 
<A NAME="542"></A>a most serious business; and that the streets should be free from all noises 
<A NAME="543"></A>and cries that accompany manual labour, and clear for the sacred solemnity. 
<A NAME="544"></A>Some traces of this custom remain at Rome to this day, for, when the consul 
<A NAME="545"></A>begins to take auspices or do sacrifice, they call out to the people, Hoc 
<A NAME="546"></A>age, Attend to this, whereby the auditors then present are admonished to 
<A NAME="547"></A>compose and recollect themselves. Many other of his precepts resemble those 
<A NAME="548"></A>of the Pythagoreans. The Pythagoreans said, for example, "Thou shalt not 
<A NAME="549"></A>make a peck-measure thy seat to sit on. Thou shalt not stir the fire with 
<A NAME="550"></A>a sword. When thou goest out upon a journey, look not behind thee. When 
<A NAME="551"></A>thou sacrificest to the celestial gods, let it be with an odd number, and 
<A NAME="552"></A>when to the terrestrial, with even." The significance of each of which 
<A NAME="553"></A>precepts they would not commonly disclose. So some of Numa's traditions 
<A NAME="554"></A>have no obvious meaning. "Thou shalt not make libation to the gods of wine 
<A NAME="555"></A>from an unpruned vine. No sacrifices shall be performed without meal. Turn 
<A NAME="556"></A>round to pay adoration to the gods; sit after you have worshipped." The 
<A NAME="557"></A>first two directions seem to denote the cultivation and subduing of the 
<A NAME="558"></A>earth as a part of religion; and as to the turning which the worshippers 
<A NAME="559"></A>are to use in divine adoration, it is said to represent the rotatory motion 
<A NAME="560"></A>of the world. But, in my opinion, the meaning rather is, that the worshipper, 
<A NAME="561"></A>since the temples front the east, enters with his back to the rising sun; 
<A NAME="562"></A>there, faces round to the east, and so turns back to the god of the temple, 
<A NAME="563"></A>by this circular movement referring the fulfilment of his prayers to both 
<A NAME="564"></A>divinities. Unless, indeed, this change of posture may have a mystical 
<A NAME="565"></A>meaning, like the Egyptian wheels, and signify to us the instability of 
<A NAME="566"></A>human fortune, and that, in whatever way God changes and turns our lot 
<A NAME="567"></A>and condition, we should rest contented, and accept it as right and fitting. 
<A NAME="568"></A>They say, also, that the sitting after worship was to be by way of omen 
<A NAME="569"></A>of their petitions being granted, and the blessing they asked assured to 
<A NAME="570"></A>them. Again, as different courses of actions are divided by intervals of 
<A NAME="571"></A>rest, they might seat themselves after the completion of what they had 
<A NAME="572"></A>done, to seek favour of the gods for beginning something else. And this 
<A NAME="573"></A>would very well suit with what we had before; the lawgiver wants to habituate 
<A NAME="574"></A>us to make our petitions to the deity not by the way, and, as it were, 
<A NAME="575"></A>in a hurry, when we have other things to do, but with time and leisure 
<A NAME="576"></A>to attend to it. By such discipline and schooling in religion, the city 
<A NAME="577"></A>passed insensibly into such a submissiveness of temper, and stood in such 
<A NAME="578"></A>awe and reverence of the virtue of Numa, that they received, with an undoubted 
<A NAME="579"></A>assurance, whatever he delivered though never so fabulous, and thought 
<A NAME="580"></A>nothing incredible or impossible from him.
<A NAME="581"></A><BR><BR>There goes a story that he once invited a great number of citizens 
<A NAME="582"></A>to an entertainment, at which the dishes in which the meat was served were 
<A NAME="583"></A>very homely and plain, and the repast itself poor and ordinary fare; the 
<A NAME="584"></A>guests seated, he began to tell them that the goddess that consulted with 
<A NAME="585"></A>him was then at that time come to him; when on a sudden the room was furnished 
<A NAME="586"></A>with all sorts of costly drinking-vessels, and the tables loaded with rich 
<A NAME="587"></A>meats, and a most sumptuous entertainment. But the dialogue which is reported 
<A NAME="588"></A>to have passed between him and Jupiter surpasses all the fabulous legends 
<A NAME="589"></A>that were ever invented. They say that before Mount Aventine was inhabited 
<A NAME="590"></A>or enclosed within the walls of the city, two demigods, Picus and Faunus, 
<A NAME="591"></A>frequented the springs and thick shades of that place; which might be two 
<A NAME="592"></A>satyrs, or Pans except that they went about Italy playing the same sorts 
<A NAME="593"></A>of tricks, by skill in drugs and magic, as are ascribed by the Greeks to 
<A NAME="594"></A>the Dactyli of Mount Ida. Numa contrived one day to surprise these demigods, 
<A NAME="595"></A>by mixing wine and honey in the waters of the spring of which they usually 
<A NAME="596"></A>drank. On finding themselves ensnared, they changed themselves into various 
<A NAME="597"></A>shapes, dropping their own form and assuming every kind of unusual and 
<A NAME="598"></A>hideous appearance; but when they saw they were safely entrapped, and in 
<A NAME="599"></A>no possibility of getting free, they revealed to him many secrets and future 
<A NAME="600"></A>events; and particularly a charm for thunder and lightning, still in use, 
<A NAME="601"></A>performed with onions and hair and pilchards. Some say they did not tell 
<A NAME="602"></A>him the charm, but by their magic brought down Jupiter out of heaven; and 
<A NAME="603"></A>that he then, in an angry manner answering the inquiries, told Numa, that, 
<A NAME="604"></A>if he would charm the thunder and lightning, he must do it with heads. 
<A NAME="605"></A>"How," said Numa, "with the heads of onions?" "No," replied Jupiter, "of 
<A NAME="606"></A>men." But Numa, willing to elude the cruelty of this receipt, turned it 
<A NAME="607"></A>another way, saying, "Your meaning is, the hairs of men's heads." "No," 
<A NAME="608"></A>replied Jupiter, "with living"- "pilchards," said Numa, interrupting him. 
<A NAME="609"></A>These answers he had learnt from Egeria. Jupiter returned again to heaven, 
<A NAME="610"></A>pacified and ileos, or propitious. The place was, in remembrance of him, 
<A NAME="611"></A>called Ilicium, from this Greek word; and the spell in this manner 
<A NAME="612"></A>effected.
<A NAME="613"></A><BR><BR>These stories, laughable as they are, show us the feelings which 
<A NAME="614"></A>people then, by force of habit, entertained towards the deity. And Numa's 
<A NAME="615"></A>own thoughts are said to have been fixed to that degree on divine objects, 
<A NAME="616"></A>that he once, when a message was brought to him that "Enemies are approaching," 
<A NAME="617"></A>answered with a smile, "And I am sacrificing." It was he, also, that built 
<A NAME="618"></A>the temples of Faith and Terminus, and taught the Romans that the name 
<A NAME="619"></A>of Faith was the most solemn oath that they could swear. They still use 
<A NAME="620"></A>it; and to the god Terminus, or Boundary, they offer to this day both public 
<A NAME="621"></A>and private sacrifices, upon the borders and stone-marks of their land; 
<A NAME="622"></A>living victims now, though anciently those sacrifices were solemnized without 
<A NAME="623"></A>blood; for Numa reasoned that the god of boundaries, who watched over peace, 
<A NAME="624"></A>and testified to fair dealing, should have no concern with blood. It is 
<A NAME="625"></A>very clear that it was this king who first prescribed bounds to the territory 
<A NAME="626"></A>of Rome; for Romulus would but have openly betrayed how much he had encroached 
<A NAME="627"></A>on his neighbours' lands, had he ever set limits to his own; for boundaries 
<A NAME="628"></A>are, indeed, a defence to those who choose to observe them, but are only 
<A NAME="629"></A>a testimony against the dishonesty of those who break through them. The 
<A NAME="630"></A>truth is, the portion of lands which the Romans possessed at the beginning 
<A NAME="631"></A>was very narrow, until Romulus enlarged them by war; all those acquisitions 
<A NAME="632"></A>Numa now divided amongst the indigent commonalty, wishing to do away with 
<A NAME="633"></A>that extreme want which is a compulsion to dishonesty, and, by turning 
<A NAME="634"></A>the people to husbandry, to bring them, as well as their lands, into better 
<A NAME="635"></A>order. For there is no employment that gives so keen and quick a relish 
<A NAME="636"></A>for peace as husbandry and a country life, which leave in men all that 
<A NAME="637"></A>kind of courage that makes them ready to fight in defence of their own, 
<A NAME="638"></A>while it destroys the licence that breaks out into acts of injustice and 
<A NAME="639"></A>rapacity. Numa, therefore, hoping agriculture would be a sort of charm 
<A NAME="640"></A>to captivate the affections of his people to peace, and viewing it rather 
<A NAME="641"></A>as a means to moral than to economical profit, divided all the lands into 
<A NAME="642"></A>several parcels, to which he gave the name of pagus, or parish, and over 
<A NAME="643"></A>every one of them he ordained chief overseers; and, taking a delight sometimes 
<A NAME="644"></A>to inspect his colonies in person, he formed his judgment of every man's 
<A NAME="645"></A>habits by the results; of which being witness himself, he preferred those 
<A NAME="646"></A>to honours and employments who had done well, and by rebukes and reproaches 
<A NAME="647"></A>incited the indolent and careless to improvement. But of all his measures 
<A NAME="648"></A>the most commended was his distribution of the people by their trades into 
<A NAME="649"></A>companies or guilds; for as the city consisted, or rather did not consist 
<A NAME="650"></A>of, but was divided into, two different tribes, the diversity between which 
<A NAME="651"></A>could not be effaced and in the meantime prevented all unity and caused 
<A NAME="652"></A>perpetual tumult and ill-blood, reflecting how hard substances that do 
<A NAME="653"></A>not readily mix when in the lump may, by being beaten into powder, in that 
<A NAME="654"></A>minute form he combined, he resolved to divide the whole population into 
<A NAME="655"></A>a number of small divisions, and thus hoped, by introducing other distinctions, 
<A NAME="656"></A>to obliterate the original and great distinction, which would be lost among 
<A NAME="657"></A>the smaller. So, distinguishing the whole people by the several arts and 
<A NAME="658"></A>trades, he formed the companies of musicians, goldsmiths, carpenters, dyers, 
<A NAME="659"></A>shoemakers, skinners, braziers, and potters; and all other handicraftsmen 
<A NAME="660"></A>he composed and reduced into a single company, appointing every one their 
<A NAME="661"></A>proper courts, councils, and religious observances. In this manner all 
<A NAME="662"></A>factious distinctions began, for the first time, to pass out of use, no 
<A NAME="663"></A>person any longer being either thought of or spoken of under the notion 
<A NAME="664"></A>of a Sabine or a Roman, a Romulian or a Tatian; and the new division became 
<A NAME="665"></A>a source of general harmony and intermixture.
<A NAME="666"></A><BR><BR>He is also much to be commended for the repeal, or rather amendment, 
<A NAME="667"></A>of that law which gives power to fathers to sell their children; he exempted 
<A NAME="668"></A>such as were married, conditionally that it had been with the liking and 
<A NAME="669"></A>consent of their parents; for it seemed a hard thing that a woman who had 
<A NAME="670"></A>given herself in marriage to a man whom she judged free should afterwards 
<A NAME="671"></A>find herself living with a slave.
<A NAME="672"></A><BR><BR>He attempted, also, the formation of a calendar, not with absolute 
<A NAME="673"></A>exactness, yet not without some scientific knowledge. During the reign 
<A NAME="674"></A>of Romulus, they had let their months run on without any certain or equal 
<A NAME="675"></A>term; some of them contained twenty days, others thirty-five, others more; 
<A NAME="676"></A>they had no sort of knowledge of the inequality in the motions of the sun 
<A NAME="677"></A>and moon; they only kept to the one rule that the whole course of the year 
<A NAME="678"></A>contained three hundred and sixty days. Numa, calculating the difference 
<A NAME="679"></A>between the lunar and the solar year at eleven days, for that the moon 
<A NAME="680"></A>completed her anniversary course in three hundred and fifty-four days, 
<A NAME="681"></A>and the sun in three hundred and sixty-five, to remedy this incongruity 
<A NAME="682"></A>doubled the eleven days, and every other year added an intercalary month, 
<A NAME="683"></A>to follow February, consisting of twenty-two days, and called by the Romans 
<A NAME="684"></A>the month Mercedinus. This amendment, however, itself, in course of time, 
<A NAME="685"></A>came to need other amendments. He also altered the order of the months; 
<A NAME="686"></A>for March, which was reckoned the first he put into the third place; and 
<A NAME="687"></A>January, which was the eleventh, he made the first; and February, which 
<A NAME="688"></A>was the twelfth and last, the second. Many will have it, that it was Numa, 
<A NAME="689"></A>also, who added the two months of January and February; for in the beginning 
<A NAME="690"></A>they had had a year of ten months; as there are barbarians who count only 
<A NAME="691"></A>three; the Arcadians, in Greece, had but four; the Acarnanians, six. The 
<A NAME="692"></A>Egyptian year at first, they say, was of one month; afterwards, of four; 
<A NAME="693"></A>and so, though they live in the newest of all countries, they have the 
<A NAME="694"></A>credit of being a more ancient nation than any, and reckon, in their genealogies, 
<A NAME="695"></A>a prodigious number of years, counting months, that is, as years. That 
<A NAME="696"></A>the Romans, at first, comprehended the whole year within ten, and not twelve 
<A NAME="697"></A>months, plainly appears by the name of the last, December, meaning the 
<A NAME="698"></A>tenth month; and that March was the first is likewise evident, for the 
<A NAME="699"></A>fifth month after it was called Quintilis, and the sixth Sextilis, and 
<A NAME="700"></A>so the rest; whereas, if January and February had, in this account, preceded 
<A NAME="701"></A>March, Quintilis would have been fifth in name and seventh in reckoning. 
<A NAME="702"></A>It was also natural that March, dedicated to Mars, should be Romulus's 
<A NAME="703"></A>first and April, named from Venus, or Aphrodite, his second month; in it 
<A NAME="704"></A>they sacrifice to Venus, and the women bathe on the calends, or first day 
<A NAME="705"></A>of it, with myrtle garlands on their heads. But others, because of its 
<A NAME="706"></A>being p and not ph, will not allow of the derivation of this word from 
<A NAME="707"></A>Aphrodite, but say it is called April from aperio, Latin for to open, because 
<A NAME="708"></A>that this month is high spring, and opens and discloses the buds and flowers. 
<A NAME="709"></A>The next is called May, from Maia, the mother of Mercury, to whom it is 
<A NAME="710"></A>sacred; then June follows, so called from Juno; some, however, derive them 
<A NAME="711"></A>from the two ages, old and young, majores, being their name for older, 
<A NAME="712"></A>and juniores for younger men. To the other months they gave denominations 
<A NAME="713"></A>according to their order; so the fifth was called Quintilis, Sextilis the 
<A NAME="714"></A>sixth, and the rest, September, October, November, and December. Afterwards 
<A NAME="715"></A>Quintilis received the name of Julius, from Caesar, who defeated Pompey; 
<A NAME="716"></A>as also Sextilis that of Augustus, from the second Caesar, who had that 
<A NAME="717"></A>title. Domitian, also, in imitation, gave the two other following months 
<A NAME="718"></A>his own names, of Germanicus and Domitianus; but, on his being slain, they 
<A NAME="719"></A>recovered their ancient denominations of September and October. The two 
<A NAME="720"></A>last are the only ones that have kept their names throughout without any 
<A NAME="721"></A>alteration. Of the months which were added or transposed in their order 
<A NAME="722"></A>by Numa, February comes from februa; and is as much a Purification month; 
<A NAME="723"></A>in it they make offerings to the dead, and celebrate the Lupercalia, which, 
<A NAME="724"></A>in most points, resembles a purification. January was also called from 
<A NAME="725"></A>janus, and precedence given to it by Numa before March, which was dedicated 
<A NAME="726"></A>to the god Mars; because, as I conceive, he wished to take every opportunity 
<A NAME="727"></A>of intimating that the arts and studies of peace are to be preferred before 
<A NAME="728"></A>those of war. For this Janus, whether in remote antiquity he were a demigod 
<A NAME="729"></A>or a king, was certainly a great lover of civil and social unity, and one 
<A NAME="730"></A>who reclaimed men from brutal and savage living; for which reason they 
<A NAME="731"></A>figure him with two faces, to represent the two states and conditions out 
<A NAME="732"></A>of the one of which he brought mankind, to lead them into the other. His 
<A NAME="733"></A>temple at Rome has two gates, which they call the gates of war, because 
<A NAME="734"></A>they stand open in the time of war, and shut in the times of peace; of 
<A NAME="735"></A>which latter there was very seldom an example, for, as the Roman empire 
<A NAME="736"></A>was enlarged and extended, it was so encompassed with barbarous nations 
<A NAME="737"></A>and enemies to be resisted, that it was seldom or never at peace. Only 
<A NAME="738"></A>in the time of Augustus Caesar, after he had overcome Antony, this temple 
<A NAME="739"></A>was shut; as likewise once before, when Marcus Atilius and Titus Manlius 
<A NAME="740"></A>were consuls; but then it was not long before, wars breaking out, the gates 
<A NAME="741"></A>were again opened. But, during the reign of Numa, those gates were never 
<A NAME="742"></A>seen open a single day, but continued constantly shut for a space of forty-three 
<A NAME="743"></A>years together; such an entire and universal cessation of war existed. 
<A NAME="744"></A>For not only had the people of Rome itself been softened and charmed into 
<A NAME="745"></A>a peaceful temper by the just and mild rule of a pacific prince, but even 
<A NAME="746"></A>the neighbouring cities, as if some salubrious and gentle air had blown 
<A NAME="747"></A>from Rome upon them, began to experience a change of feeling, and partook 
<A NAME="748"></A>in the general longing for the sweets of peace and order, and for life 
<A NAME="749"></A>employed in the quiet tillage of soil, bringing up of children, and worship 
<A NAME="750"></A>of the gods. Festival days and sports, and the secure and peaceful interchange 
<A NAME="751"></A>of friendly visits and hospitalities prevailed all through the whole of 
<A NAME="752"></A>Italy. The love of virtue and justice flowed from Numa's wisdom as from 
<A NAME="753"></A>a fountain, and the serenity of his spirit diffused itself, like a calm, 
<A NAME="754"></A>on all sides; so that the hyperboles of poets were flat and tame to express 
<A NAME="755"></A>what then existed; as that-
<A NAME="756"></A><BR><BR>"Over the iron shield the spiders hang their threads," or 
<A NAME="757"></A>that-
<A NAME="758"></A><BR><BR>"Rust eats the pointed spear and double-edged 
<A NAME="759"></A>sword.
<A NAME="760"></A><BR>No more is heard the trumpet's brazen roar,
<A NAME="761"></A><BR>Sweet sleep is banished from our eyes no more."
<A NAME="762"></A><BR><BR>For during the whole reign of Numa, there was neither war, nor 
<A NAME="763"></A>sedition, nor innovation in the state, nor any envy or ill-will to his 
<A NAME="764"></A>person, nor plot or conspiracy from views of ambition. Either fear of the 
<A NAME="765"></A>gods that were thought to watch over him, or reverence for his virtue, 
<A NAME="766"></A>or divine felicity of fortune that in his days preserved human innocence, 
<A NAME="767"></A>made his reign, by whatever means, a living example and verification of 
<A NAME="768"></A>that saying which Plato, long afterwards, ventured to pronounce, that the 
<A NAME="769"></A>sole and only hope of respite or remedy for human evils was in some happy 
<A NAME="770"></A>conjunction of events which should unite in a single person the power of 
<A NAME="771"></A>a king and the wisdom of a philosopher, so as to elevate virtue to control 
<A NAME="772"></A>and mastery over vice. The wise man is blessed in himself, and blessed 
<A NAME="773"></A>also are the auditors who can bear and receive those words which flow from 
<A NAME="774"></A>his mouth; and perhaps, too, there is no need of compulsion or menaces 
<A NAME="775"></A>to affect the multitude, for the mere sight itself of a shining and conspicuous 
<A NAME="776"></A>example of virtue in the life of their prince will bring them spontaneously 
<A NAME="777"></A>to virtue, and to a conformity with that blameless and blessed life of 
<A NAME="778"></A>good-will and mutual concord, supported by temperance and justice, which 
<A NAME="779"></A>is the highest benefit that human means can confer; and he is the truest 
<A NAME="780"></A>ruler who can best introduce it into the hearts and practice of his subjects. 
<A NAME="781"></A>It is the praise of Numa that no one seems ever to have discerned this 
<A NAME="782"></A>so clearly as he.
<A NAME="783"></A><BR><BR>As to his children and wives, there is a diversity of reports by 
<A NAME="784"></A>several authors; some will have it that he never had any other wife than 
<A NAME="785"></A>Tatia; nor more children than one daughter called Pompilia; others will 
<A NAME="786"></A>have it that he left also four sons, namely, Pompo, Pinus, Calpus, and 
<A NAME="787"></A>Mamercus, every one of whom had issue, and from them descended the noble 
<A NAME="788"></A>and illustrious families of Pomponii, Pinarii, Calpurnii, and Mamerci, 
<A NAME="789"></A>which for this reason took also the surname of Rex, or King. But there 
<A NAME="790"></A>is a third set of writers who say that these pedigrees are but a piece 
<A NAME="791"></A>of flattery used by writers who, to gain favour with these great families, 
<A NAME="792"></A>made them fictitious genealogies from the lineage of Numa; and that Pompilia 
<A NAME="793"></A>was not the daughter of Tatia, but Lucretia, another wife whom he married 
<A NAME="794"></A>after he came to his kingdom; however, all of them agree in opinion that 
<A NAME="795"></A>she was married to the son of that Marcius who persuaded him to accept 
<A NAME="796"></A>the government, and accompanied him to Rome, where, as a mark of honour, 
<A NAME="797"></A>he was chosen into the senate, and after the death of Numa, standing in 
<A NAME="798"></A>competition with Tullus Hostilius for the kingdom, and being disappointed 
<A NAME="799"></A>of the election, in discontent killed himself; his son Marcius, however, 
<A NAME="800"></A>who had married Pompilia, continuing at Rome, was the father of Ancus Marcius, 
<A NAME="801"></A>who succeeded Tullus Hostilius in the kingdom, and was but five years of 
<A NAME="802"></A>age when Numa died.
<A NAME="803"></A><BR><BR>Numa lived something above eighty years, and then, as Piso writes, 
<A NAME="804"></A>was not taken out of the world by a sudden or acute disease, but died of 
<A NAME="805"></A>old age and by a gradual and gentle decline. At his funeral all the glories 
<A NAME="806"></A>of his life were consummated, when all the neighbouring states in alliance 
<A NAME="807"></A>and amity with Rome met to honour and grace the rites of his interment 
<A NAME="808"></A>with garlands and public presents; the senators carried the bier on which 
<A NAME="809"></A>his corpse was laid, and the priests followed and accompanied the solemn 
<A NAME="810"></A>procession; while a general crowd, in which women and children took part, 
<A NAME="811"></A>followed with such cries and weeping as if they had bewailed the death 
<A NAME="812"></A>and loss of some most dear relation taken away in the flower of age, and 
<A NAME="813"></A>not an old and worn-out king. It is said that his body, by his particular 
<A NAME="814"></A>command, was not burnt, but that they made, in conformity with his order, 
<A NAME="815"></A>two stone coffins, and buried both under the hill Janiculum, in one of 
<A NAME="816"></A>which his body was laid, and the other his sacred books, which, as the 
<A NAME="817"></A>Greek legislators their tables, he had written out for himself, but had 
<A NAME="818"></A>so long inculcated the contents of them, whilst he lived, into the minds 
<A NAME="819"></A>and hearts of the priests, that their understandings became fully possessed 
<A NAME="820"></A>with the whole spirit and purpose of them; and he therefore bade that they 
<A NAME="821"></A>should be buried with his body, as though such holy precepts could not 
<A NAME="822"></A>without irreverence he left to circulate in mere lifeless writings. For 
<A NAME="823"></A>this very reason, they say, the Pythagoreans bade that their precepts should 
<A NAME="824"></A>not be committed to paper, but rather preserved in the living memories 
<A NAME="825"></A>of those who were worthy to receive them; and when some of their out-of-the-way 
<A NAME="826"></A>and abstruse geometrical processes had been divulged to an unworthy person, 
<A NAME="827"></A>they said the gods threatened to punish this wickedness and profanity by 
<A NAME="828"></A>a signal and wide-spreading calamity. With these several instances concurring 
<A NAME="829"></A>to show a similarity in the lives of Numa and Pythagoras, we may easily 
<A NAME="830"></A>pardon those who seek to establish the fact of a real acquaintance between 
<A NAME="831"></A>them.
<A NAME="832"></A><BR><BR>Valerius Antias writes that the books which were buried in the 
<A NAME="833"></A>aforesaid chest or coffin of stone were twelve volumes of holy writ and 
<A NAME="834"></A>twelve others of Greek philosophy, and that about four hundred years afterwards, 
<A NAME="835"></A>when P. Cornelius and M. Baebius were consuls, in a time of heavy rains, 
<A NAME="836"></A>a violent torrent washed away the earth, and dislodged the chests of stone; 
<A NAME="837"></A>and, their covers falling off, one of them was found wholly empty, without 
<A NAME="838"></A>the least relic of any human body; in the other were the books before mentioned, 
<A NAME="839"></A>which the praetor Petilius having read and perused, made oath in the senate, 
<A NAME="840"></A>that, in his opinion, it was not fit for their contents to be made public 
<A NAME="841"></A>to the people; whereupon the volumes were all carried to the Comitium, 
<A NAME="842"></A>and there burnt.
<A NAME="843"></A><BR><BR>It is the fortune of all good men that their virtue rises in glory 
<A NAME="844"></A>after their deaths, and that the envy which evil men conceive against them 
<A NAME="845"></A>never outlives them long; some have the happiness even to see it die before 
<A NAME="846"></A>them; but in Numa's case, also, the fortunes of the succeeding kings served 
<A NAME="847"></A>as foils to set off the brightness of his reputation. For after him there 
<A NAME="848"></A>were five kings, the last of whom ended his old age in banishment, being 
<A NAME="849"></A>deposed from his crown; of the other four, three were assassinated and 
<A NAME="850"></A>murdered by treason; the other, who was Tullus Hostilius, that immediately 
<A NAME="851"></A>succeeded Numa, derided his virtues, and especially his devotion to religious 
<A NAME="852"></A>worship, as a cowardly and mean-spirited occupation, and diverted the minds 
<A NAME="853"></A>of the people to war; but was checked in these youthful insolences, and 
<A NAME="854"></A>was himself driven by an acute and tormenting disease into superstitions 
<A NAME="855"></A>wholly different from Numa's piety, and left others also to participate 
<A NAME="856"></A>in these terrors when he died by the stroke of a thunderbolt.
