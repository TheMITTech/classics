<A NAME="2"></A>
<BR>(legendary, died 160 B.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Almost all agree that the Aemilii were one of the ancient and patrician 
<A NAME="11"></A>houses in Rome; and those authors who affirm that King Numa was pupil to 
<A NAME="12"></A>Pythagoras tell us that the first who gave name to his posterity was Mamercus, 
<A NAME="13"></A>the son of Pythagoras, who, for his grace and address in speaking, was 
<A NAME="14"></A>called Aemilius. Most of this race that have risen through their merit 
<A NAME="15"></A>to reputation also enjoyed good fortune: and even the misfortune to Lucius 
<A NAME="16"></A>Paulus at the battle of Cannae gave testimony to his wisdom and valour. 
<A NAME="17"></A>For not being able to persuade his colleague not to hazard the battle, 
<A NAME="18"></A>he, though against his judgment, joined with him in the contest, but was 
<A NAME="19"></A>no companion in his flight: on the contrary, when he that was so resolute 
<A NAME="20"></A>to engage deserted him in the midst of danger he kept the field and died 
<A NAME="21"></A>fighting. This Aemilius had a daughter named Aemilia, who was married to 
<A NAME="22"></A>Scipio the Great, and a son Paulus, who is the subject of my present 
<A NAME="23"></A>history.
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR>In his early manhood, which fell at a time when Rome was flourishing 
<A NAME="25"></A>with illustrious characters, he was distinguished for not attaching himself 
<A NAME="26"></A>to the studies usual with the young men of mark of that age, nor treading 
<A NAME="27"></A>the same paths to fame. For he did not practise oratory with a view to 
<A NAME="28"></A>pleading causes, nor would he stoop to salute, embrace, and entertain the 
<A NAME="29"></A>vulgar, which were the usual insinuating arts by which many grew popular. 
<A NAME="30"></A>Not that he was incapable of either, but he chose to purchase a much more 
<A NAME="31"></A>lasting glory by his valour, justice, and integrity, and in these virtues 
<A NAME="32"></A>he soon oustripped all his equals.
<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR>The first honourable office he aspired to was that of aedile, which 
<A NAME="34"></A>he carried against twelve competitors of such merit that all of them in 
<A NAME="35"></A>process of time were consuls. Being afterwards chosen into the number of 
<A NAME="36"></A>priests called augurs, appointed amongst the Romans to observe and register 
<A NAME="37"></A>divinations made by the flight of birds or prodigies in the air, he so 
<A NAME="38"></A>carefully studied the ancient customs of his country, and so thoroughly 
<A NAME="39"></A>understood the religion of his ancestors, that this office which was before 
<A NAME="40"></A>only esteemed a title of honour and merely upon that account sought after, 
<A NAME="41"></A>by this means rose to the rank of one of the highest arts, and gave a confirmation 
<A NAME="42"></A>to the correctness of the definition, which some philosophers have given 
<A NAME="43"></A>of religion, that it is the science of worshipping the gods. When he performed 
<A NAME="44"></A>any part of his duty, he did it with great skill and utmost care, making 
<A NAME="45"></A>it, when he was engaged in it, his only business, not omitting any one 
<A NAME="46"></A>ceremony, or adding the least circumstance, but always insisting, with 
<A NAME="47"></A>his companions of the same order, even on points that might seem inconsiderable, 
<A NAME="48"></A>and urging upon them, that though they might think the Deity was easily 
<A NAME="49"></A>pacified, and ready to forgive faults of inadvertency, yet any such laxity 
<A NAME="50"></A>was a very dangerous thing for a commonwealth to allow; because no man 
<A NAME="51"></A>ever began the disturbance of his country's peace by a notorious breach 
<A NAME="52"></A>of its laws; and those who are careless in trifles give a precedent for 
<A NAME="53"></A>remissness in important duties. Nor was he less severe in requiring and 
<A NAME="54"></A>observing the ancient Roman discipline in military affairs; not endeavouring, 
<A NAME="55"></A>when he had the command, to ingratiate himself with his soldiers by popular 
<A NAME="56"></A>flattery, though this custom prevailed at that time amongst many, who, 
<A NAME="57"></A>by favour and gentleness to those that were under them in their first employment, 
<A NAME="58"></A>sought to be promoted to a second; but, by instructing them in the laws 
<A NAME="59"></A>of military discipline with the same care and exactness a priest would 
<A NAME="60"></A>use in teaching ceremonies and dreadful mysteries, and by severity to such 
<A NAME="61"></A>as transgressed and contemned those laws, he maintained his country in 
<A NAME="62"></A>its former greatness, esteeming victory over enemies itself but as an accessory 
<A NAME="63"></A>to the proper training and disciplining of the citizens.
<A NAME="64"></A><BR><BR>Whilst the Romans were engaged in war with Antiochus the Great, 
<A NAME="65"></A>against whom their most experienced commanders were employed, there arose 
<A NAME="66"></A>another war in the west, and they were all up in arms in Spain. Thither 
<A NAME="67"></A>they sent Aemilius, in the quality of praetor, not with six axes, which 
<A NAME="68"></A>number other praetors were accustomed to have carried before them, but 
<A NAME="69"></A>with twelve; so that in his praetorship he was honoured with the dignity 
<A NAME="70"></A>of a consul. He twice overcame the barbarians in battle, thirty thousand 
<A NAME="71"></A>of whom were slain: successes chiefly to be ascribed to the wisdom and 
<A NAME="72"></A>conduct of the commander, who by his great skill in choosing the advantage 
<A NAME="73"></A>of the ground, and making the onset at the passage of a river, gave his 
<A NAME="74"></A>soldiers an easy victory. Having made himself master of two hundred and 
<A NAME="75"></A>fifty cities, whose inhabitants voluntarily yielded, and bound themselves 
<A NAME="76"></A>by oath to fidelity, he left the province in peace, and returned to Rome, 
<A NAME="77"></A>not enriching himself a drachma by the war. And, indeed, in general, he 
<A NAME="78"></A>was but remiss in making money; though he always lived freely and generously 
<A NAME="79"></A>on what he had, which was so far from being excessive, that after his death 
<A NAME="80"></A>there was barely enough left to answer his wife's dowry.
<A NAME="81"></A><BR><BR>His first wife was Papiria, the daughter of Maso, who had formerly 
<A NAME="82"></A>been consul. With her he lived a considerable time in wedlock, and then 
<A NAME="83"></A>divorced her, though she had made him the father of noble children; being 
<A NAME="84"></A>mother of the renowned Scipio and Fabius Maximus. The reason of this separation 
<A NAME="85"></A>has not come to our knowledge; but there seems to be a truth conveyed in 
<A NAME="86"></A>the account of another Roman's being divorced from his wife, which may 
<A NAME="87"></A>be applicable here. This person being highly blamed by his friends, who 
<A NAME="88"></A>demanded, Was she not chaste? was she not fair? was she not fruitful? holding 
<A NAME="89"></A>out his shoe, asked them, Whether it was not new? and well made? Yet, added 
<A NAME="90"></A>he, none of you can tell where it pinches me. Certain it is, that great 
<A NAME="91"></A>and open faults have often led to no separation; while mere petty repeated 
<A NAME="92"></A>annoyances, arising from unpleasantness or incongruity of character, have 
<A NAME="93"></A>been the occasion of such estrangement as to make it impossible for man 
<A NAME="94"></A>and wife to live together with any content.
<A NAME="95"></A><BR><BR>Aemilius, having thus put away Papiria, married a second wife, 
<A NAME="96"></A>by whom he had two sons, whom he brought up in his own house, transferring 
<A NAME="97"></A>the two former into the greatest and the most noble families of Rome. The 
<A NAME="98"></A>elder was adopted into the house of Fabius Maximus, who was five times 
<A NAME="99"></A>consul; the younger by the son of Scipio Africanus, his cousin-german, 
<A NAME="100"></A>and was by him named Scipio.
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR>Of the daughters of Aemilius, one was married to the son of Cato, 
<A NAME="102"></A>the other to Aelius Tubero, a most worthy man, and the one Roman who best 
<A NAME="103"></A>succeeded in combining liberal habits with poverty. For there were sixteen 
<A NAME="104"></A>near relations, all of them of the family of the Aelii, possessed of but 
<A NAME="105"></A>one farm, which sufficed them all, whilst one small house, or rather cottage, 
<A NAME="106"></A>contained them, their numerous offspring, and their wives; amongst whom 
<A NAME="107"></A>was the daughter of our Aemilius, who, although her father had been twice 
<A NAME="108"></A>consul, and had twice triumphed, was not ashamed of her husband's poverty, 
<A NAME="109"></A>but proud of his virtue that kept him poor. Far otherwise it is with the 
<A NAME="110"></A>brothers and relations of this age, who, unless whole tracts of land, or 
<A NAME="111"></A>at least walls and rivers, part their inheritances, and keep them at a 
<A NAME="112"></A>distance, never cease from mutual quarrels. History suggests a variety 
<A NAME="113"></A>of good counsel of this sort, by the way, to those who desire to learn 
<A NAME="114"></A>and improve.
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR>To proceed: Aemilius, being chosen consul, waged war with the Ligurians, 
<A NAME="116"></A>or Ligustines, a people near the Alps. They were a bold and warlike nation, 
<A NAME="117"></A>and their neighbourhood to the Romans had begun to give them skill in the 
<A NAME="118"></A>arts of war. They occupy the further parts of Italy ending under the Alps, 
<A NAME="119"></A>and those parts of the Alps themselves which are washed by the Tuscan sea 
<A NAME="120"></A>and face toward Africa, mingled there with Gauls and Iberians of the coast. 
<A NAME="121"></A>Besides, at that time they had turned their thoughts to the seas and sailing 
<A NAME="122"></A>as far as the Pillars of Hercules in light vessels fitted for that purpose, 
<A NAME="123"></A>robbed and destroyed all that trafficked in those parts. They, with an 
<A NAME="124"></A>army of forty thousand, waited the coming of Aemilius, who brought with 
<A NAME="125"></A>him not above eight thousand, so that the enemy was five to one when they 
<A NAME="126"></A>engaged; yet he vanquished and put them to flight, forcing them to retire 
<A NAME="127"></A>into their walled towns, and in this condition offered them fair conditions 
<A NAME="128"></A>of accommodation; it being the policy of the Romans not utterly to destroy 
<A NAME="129"></A>the Ligurians, because they were a sort of guard and bulwark against the 
<A NAME="130"></A>frequent attempts of the Gauls to overrun Italy. Trusting wholly therefore 
<A NAME="131"></A>to Aemilius, they delivered up their towns and shipping into his hands. 
<A NAME="132"></A>He, at the utmost, razed only the fortifications and delivered their towns 
<A NAME="133"></A>to them again, but took away all their shipping with him, leaving them 
<A NAME="134"></A>no vessels bigger than those of three oars, and set at liberty great numbers 
<A NAME="135"></A>of prisoners they had taken both by sea and land, strangers as well as 
<A NAME="136"></A>Romans. These were the acts most worthy of remark in his first 
<A NAME="137"></A>consulship.
<A NAME="138"></A><BR><BR>Afterwards he frequently intimated his desire of being a second 
<A NAME="139"></A>time consul, and was once candidate; but meeting with a repulse and being 
<A NAME="140"></A>passed by, he gave up all thought of it, and devoted himself to his duties 
<A NAME="141"></A>as augur, and to the education of his children, whom he not only brought 
<A NAME="142"></A>up, as he himself had been, in the Roman and ancient discipline, but also 
<A NAME="143"></A>with unusual zeal in that of Greece. To this purpose he not only procured 
<A NAME="144"></A>masters to teach them grammar, logic, and rhetoric, but had for them also 
<A NAME="145"></A>preceptors in modelling and drawing, managers of horses and dogs, and instructors 
<A NAME="146"></A>in field sports, all from Greece. And, if he was not hindered by public 
<A NAME="147"></A>affairs, he himself would be with them at their studies, and see them perform 
<A NAME="148"></A>their exercises, being the most affectionate father in 
<A NAME="149"></A>Rome.
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR>This was the time, in public matters, when the Romans were engaged 
<A NAME="151"></A>in war with Perseus, King of the Macedonians, and great complaints were 
<A NAME="152"></A>made of their commanders, who, either through their want of skill or courage, 
<A NAME="153"></A>were conducting matters so shamefully, that they did less hurt to the enemy 
<A NAME="154"></A>than they received from him. They that not long before had forced Antiochus 
<A NAME="155"></A>the Great to quit the rest of Asia, to retire beyond Mount Taurus, and 
<A NAME="156"></A>confine himself to Syria, glad to buy his peace with fifteen thousand talents; 
<A NAME="157"></A>they that not long since had vanquished King Philip in Thessaly, and freed 
<A NAME="158"></A>the Greeks from the Macedonian yoke; nay, had overcome Hannibal himself, 
<A NAME="159"></A>who far surpassed all kings in daring and power- thought it scorn that 
<A NAME="160"></A>Perseus should think himself an enemy fit to match the Romans, and to be 
<A NAME="161"></A>able to wage war with them so long on equal terms, with the remainder only 
<A NAME="162"></A>of his father's routed forces; not being aware that Philip after his defeat 
<A NAME="163"></A>had greatly improved both the strength and discipline of the Macedonian 
<A NAME="164"></A>army. To make which appear, I shall briefly recount the story from the 
<A NAME="165"></A>beginning.
<A NAME="166"></A><BR><BR>Antigonus, the most powerful amongst the captains and successors 
<A NAME="167"></A>of Alexander, having obtained for himself and his posterity the title of 
<A NAME="168"></A>king, had a son named Demetrius, father to Antigonus, called Gonatas, and 
<A NAME="169"></A>he had a son Demetrius, who, reigning some short time, died and left a 
<A NAME="170"></A>young son called Philip. The chief men of Macedon, fearing great confusion 
<A NAME="171"></A>might arise in his minority, called in Antigonus, cousin-german to the 
<A NAME="172"></A>late king, and married him to the widow, the mother of Philip. At first 
<A NAME="173"></A>they only styled him regent and general, but when they found by experience 
<A NAME="174"></A>that he governed the kingdom with moderation and to general advantage, 
<A NAME="175"></A>gave him the title of king. This was he that was surnamed Doson, as if 
<A NAME="176"></A>he was a great promiser and a bad performer. To him succeeded Philip, who 
<A NAME="177"></A>in his youth gave great hopes of equalling the best of kings, and that 
<A NAME="178"></A>he one day would restore Macedon to its former state and dignity, and prove 
<A NAME="179"></A>himself the one man able to check the power of the Romans, now rising and 
<A NAME="180"></A>extending over the whole world. But, being vanquished in a pitched battle 
<A NAME="181"></A>by Titus Flaminius near Scotussa, his resolution failed, and he yielded 
<A NAME="182"></A>himself and all that he had to the mercy of the Romans, well contented 
<A NAME="183"></A>that he could escape with paying a small tribute. Yet afterwards, recollecting 
<A NAME="184"></A>himself, he bore it with great impatience, and though he lived rather like 
<A NAME="185"></A>a slave that was pleased with ease, than a man of sense and courage, whilst 
<A NAME="186"></A>he held his kingdom at the pleasure of his conquerors; which made him turn 
<A NAME="187"></A>his whole mind to war, and prepare himself with as much cunning and privacy 
<A NAME="188"></A>as possible. To this end, he left his cities on the high roads and sea-coast 
<A NAME="189"></A>ungarrisoned, and almost desolate, that they might seem inconsiderable; 
<A NAME="190"></A>in the meantime, collecting large forces up the country, and furnishing 
<A NAME="191"></A>his inland posts, strongholds, and towns, with arms, money, and men fit 
<A NAME="192"></A>for service, he thus provided himself for war, and yet kept his preparations 
<A NAME="193"></A>close. He had in his armoury arms for thirty thousand men; in granaries, 
<A NAME="194"></A>in places of strength, eight millions of bushels of corn, and as much ready 
<A NAME="195"></A>money as would defray the charge of maintaining ten thousand mercenary 
<A NAME="196"></A>soldiers for ten years in defence of the country. But before he could put 
<A NAME="197"></A>these things into motion, and carry his designs into effect, he died for 
<A NAME="198"></A>griefs and anguish of mind, being sensible he had put his innocent son 
<A NAME="199"></A>Demetrius to death, upon the calumnies of one that was far more guilty. 
<A NAME="200"></A>Perseus, his son that survived, inherited his hatred to the Romans as well 
<A NAME="201"></A>as his kingdom, but was incompetent to carry out his designs, through want 
<A NAME="202"></A>of courage and the viciousness of a character in which, among faults and 
<A NAME="203"></A>diseases of various sorts, covetousness bore the chief place. There is 
<A NAME="204"></A>a statement also of his not being true-born; that the wife of King Philip 
<A NAME="205"></A>took him from his mother, Gnathaenion (a woman of Argos, that earned her 
<A NAME="206"></A>living as a seamstress), as soon as he was born, and passed him upon her 
<A NAME="207"></A>husband as her own. And this might be the chief cause of his contriving 
<A NAME="208"></A>the death of Demetrius, as he might well fear that, so long as there was 
<A NAME="209"></A>a lawful successor in the family, there was no security that his spurious 
<A NAME="210"></A>birth might not be revealed.
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR>Notwithstanding all this, and though his spirit was so mean and 
<A NAME="212"></A>temper so sordid, yet trusting to the strength of his resources, he engaged 
<A NAME="213"></A>in a war with the Romans, and for a long time maintained it; repulsing 
<A NAME="214"></A>and even vanquishing some generals of consular dignity, and some great 
<A NAME="215"></A>armies and fleets. He routed Publius Licinius, who was the first that invaded 
<A NAME="216"></A>Macedonia, in a cavalry battle, slew twenty-five hundred practiced soldiers, 
<A NAME="217"></A>and took six hundred prisoners; and surprising their fleet as they rode 
<A NAME="218"></A>at anchor before Orens he took twenty ships of burden with all their lading, 
<A NAME="219"></A>sunk the rest that were freighted with corn, and, besides this, made himself 
<A NAME="220"></A>master of four galleys with five banks of oars. He fought a second battle 
<A NAME="221"></A>with Hostilius, a consular officer, as he was making his way into the country 
<A NAME="222"></A>at Elimiae, and forced him to retreat; and, when he afterwards by stealth 
<A NAME="223"></A>designed an invasion through Thessaly challenged him to fight, which the 
<A NAME="224"></A>other feared to accept. Nay more, to show his contempt to the Romans, and 
<A NAME="225"></A>that he wanted employment, as a war by the by, he made an expedition against 
<A NAME="226"></A>the Dardanians, in which he slew ten thousand of those barbarian people, 
<A NAME="227"></A>and brought a great spoil away. He privately, moreover, solicited the Gauls 
<A NAME="228"></A>(also called Basternae), a warlike nation and famous for horsemen, dwelling 
<A NAME="229"></A>near the Danube; and incited the Illyrians, by the means of Genthius their 
<A NAME="230"></A>king, to join with him in the war. It was also reported that the barbarians, 
<A NAME="231"></A>allured by promise of rewards, were to make an irruption into Italy, through 
<A NAME="232"></A>the lower Gaul by the shore of the Adriatic Sea.
<A NAME="233"></A><BR><BR>The Romans, being advertised of these things, thought it necessary 
<A NAME="234"></A>no longer to choose their commanders by favour or solicitation, but of 
<A NAME="235"></A>their own motion to select a general of wisdom and capacity for the management 
<A NAME="236"></A>of great affairs. And such was Paulus Aemilius, advanced in years, being 
<A NAME="237"></A>nearly threescore, yet vigorous in his own person, and rich in valiant 
<A NAME="238"></A>sons and sons-in-law, besides a great number of influential relations and 
<A NAME="239"></A>friends, all of whom joined in urging him to yield to the desires of the 
<A NAME="240"></A>people, who called him to the consulship. He at first manifested some shyness 
<A NAME="241"></A>of the people and withdrew himself from their importunity, professing reluctance 
<A NAME="242"></A>to hold office; but, when they daily came to his doors, urging him to come 
<A NAME="243"></A>forth to the place of election, and pressing him with noise and clamour, 
<A NAME="244"></A>he acceded to their request. When he appeared amongst the candidates, it 
<A NAME="245"></A>did not look as if it were to sue for the consulship, but to bring victory 
<A NAME="246"></A>and success, that he came down into the Campus; they all received him there 
<A NAME="247"></A>with such hopes and such gladness, unanimously choosing him a second time 
<A NAME="248"></A>consul; nor would they suffer the lots to be cast, as was usual, to determine 
<A NAME="249"></A>which province should fall to his share, but immediately decreed him the 
<A NAME="250"></A>command of the Macedonian war. It is told, that when he had been proclaimed 
<A NAME="251"></A>general against Perseus, and was honourably accompanied home by great numbers 
<A NAME="252"></A>of people, he found his daughter Tertia, a very little girl, weeping, and 
<A NAME="253"></A>taking her to him asked her why she was crying. She, catching him about 
<A NAME="254"></A>the neck and kissing him, said, "O father, do you not know that Perseus 
<A NAME="255"></A>is dead?" meaning a little dog of that name that was brought up in the 
<A NAME="256"></A>house with her; to which Aemilius replied, "Good fortune, my daughter; 
<A NAME="257"></A>I embrace the omen." This Cicero, the orator, relates in his book on 
<A NAME="258"></A>divination.
<A NAME="259"></A><BR><BR>It was the custom for such as were chosen consuls, from a stage 
<A NAME="260"></A>designed for such purposes, to address the people, and return them thanks 
<A NAME="261"></A>for their favour. Aemilius, therefore, having gathered an assembly, spoke 
<A NAME="262"></A>and said that he sued for the first consulship, because he himself stood 
<A NAME="263"></A>in need of such honour; but for the second, because they wanted a general; 
<A NAME="264"></A>upon which account he thought there was no thanks due: if they judged they 
<A NAME="265"></A>could manage the war by any other to more advantage, he would willingly 
<A NAME="266"></A>yield up his charge; but, if they confided in him, they were not to make 
<A NAME="267"></A>themselves his colleagues in his office, or raise reports, and criticize 
<A NAME="268"></A>his actions, but, without talking, supply him with means and assistance 
<A NAME="269"></A>necessary to the carrying on of the war; for if they proposed to command 
<A NAME="270"></A>their own commander they would render this expedition more ridiculous than 
<A NAME="271"></A>the former. By this speech he inspired great reverence for him amongst 
<A NAME="272"></A>the citizens and great expectations of future success; all were well pleased 
<A NAME="273"></A>that they had passed by such as sought to be preferred by flattery, and 
<A NAME="274"></A>fixed upon a commander endued with wisdom and courage to tell them the 
<A NAME="275"></A>truth. So entirely did the people of Rome, that they might rule, and become 
<A NAME="276"></A>masters of the world, yield obedience and service to reason and superior 
<A NAME="277"></A>virtue.
<A NAME="278"></A><BR><BR>That Aemilius, setting forward to the war, by a prosperous voyage 
<A NAME="279"></A>and successful journey, arrived with speed and safety at his camp I attribute 
<A NAME="280"></A>to good fortune; but, when I see how the war under his command was brought 
<A NAME="281"></A>to a happy issue, partly by his own daring boldness, partly by his good 
<A NAME="282"></A>counsel, partly by the ready administration of his friends, partly by his 
<A NAME="283"></A>presence of mind and skill to embrace the most proper advice in the extremity 
<A NAME="284"></A>of danger, I cannot ascribe any of his remarkable and famous actions (as 
<A NAME="285"></A>I can those of other commanders) to his so much celebrated good fortune; 
<A NAME="286"></A>unless you will say that the covetousness of Perseus was the good fortune 
<A NAME="287"></A>of Aemilius. The truth is, Perseus' fear of spending his money was the 
<A NAME="288"></A>destruction and utter ruin of all those splendid and great preparations 
<A NAME="289"></A>with which the Macedonians were in high hopes to carry on the war with 
<A NAME="290"></A>success. For there came at his request ten thousand horsemen of the Basternae, 
<A NAME="291"></A>and as many foot, who were to keep pace with them, and supply their places 
<A NAME="292"></A>in case of failure; all of them professed soldiers, men skilled neither 
<A NAME="293"></A>in tilling of land, nor in navigation of ships, nor able to get their living 
<A NAME="294"></A>by grazing, but whose only business and single art and trade it was to 
<A NAME="295"></A>fight and conquer all that resisted them. When these came into the district 
<A NAME="296"></A>of Maedica, and encamped and mixed with the king's soldiers, being men 
<A NAME="297"></A>of great stature, admirable at their exercises, great boasters, and loud 
<A NAME="298"></A>in their threats against their enemies, they gave new courage to the Macedonians, 
<A NAME="299"></A>who were ready to think the Romans would not be able to confront them, 
<A NAME="300"></A>but would be struck with terror at their looks and motions, they were so 
<A NAME="301"></A>strange and so formidable to behold. When Perseus had thus encouraged his 
<A NAME="302"></A>men, and elevated them with these great hopes, as soon as a thousand gold 
<A NAME="303"></A>pieces were demanded for each captain, he was so amazed and beside himself 
<A NAME="304"></A>at the vastness of the amount, that out of mere stinginess he drew back 
<A NAME="305"></A>and let himself lose their assistance, as if he had been some steward, 
<A NAME="306"></A>not the enemy of the Romans, and would have to give an exact account of 
<A NAME="307"></A>the expenses of the war to those with whom he waged it. Nay, when he had 
<A NAME="308"></A>his foes as tutors, to instruct him what he had to do, who, besides their 
<A NAME="309"></A>other preparations, had a hundred thousand men drawn together and in readiness 
<A NAME="310"></A>for their service; yet he that was to engage against so considerable a 
<A NAME="311"></A>force, and in a war that was maintaining such numbers as this, nevertheless 
<A NAME="312"></A>doled out his money, and put seals on his bags, and was as fearful of touching 
<A NAME="313"></A>it, as if it had belonged to some one else. And all this was done by one, 
<A NAME="314"></A>not descended from Lydians or Phoenicians, but who could pretend to some 
<A NAME="315"></A>share of the virtues of Alexander and Philip, whom he was allied to by 
<A NAME="316"></A>birth; men who conquered the world by judging that empire was to be purchased 
<A NAME="317"></A>by money, not money by empire. Certainly it became a proverb, that not 
<A NAME="318"></A>Philip, but his gold, took the cities of Greece. And Alexander, when he 
<A NAME="319"></A>undertook his expedition against the Indians, and found his Macedonians 
<A NAME="320"></A>encumbered and appear to march heavily with their Persian spoils, first 
<A NAME="321"></A>set fire to his own carriages, and thence persuaded the rest to imitate 
<A NAME="322"></A>his example, that thus freed they might proceed to the war without hindrance. 
<A NAME="323"></A>Whereas Perseus, abounding in wealth, would not preserve himself, his children, 
<A NAME="324"></A>and his kingdom, at the expense of a small part of his treasure; but chose 
<A NAME="325"></A>rather to be carried away with numbers of his subjects with the name of 
<A NAME="326"></A>the wealthy captive, and show the Romans what great riches he had husbanded 
<A NAME="327"></A>and preserved for them. For he not only played false with the Gauls, and 
<A NAME="328"></A>sent them away, but also, after alluring Genthius, King of the Illyrians, 
<A NAME="329"></A>by the hopes of three hundred talents, to assist him in the war, he caused 
<A NAME="330"></A>the money to be counted out in the presence of his messengers, and to be 
<A NAME="331"></A>sealed up. Upon which Genthius, thinking himself possessed of what he desired, 
<A NAME="332"></A>committed a wicked and shameful act: he seized and imprisoned the ambassadors 
<A NAME="333"></A>sent to him from the Romans. Whence Perseus, concluding that there was 
<A NAME="334"></A>no need of money to make Genthius an enemy to the Romans, but that he had 
<A NAME="335"></A>given a lasting earnest of his enmity, and by his flagrant injustice sufficiently 
<A NAME="336"></A>involved himself in the war, defrauded the unfortunate king of his three 
<A NAME="337"></A>hundred talents, and without any concern beheld him, his wife, and children, 
<A NAME="338"></A>in a short time after, carried out of their kingdom, as from their nest, 
<A NAME="339"></A>by Lucius Anicius, who was sent against him with an 
<A NAME="340"></A>army.
<A NAME="341"></A><BR><BR>Aemilius, coming against such an adversary, made light indeed of 
<A NAME="342"></A>him, but admired his preparation and power. For he had four thousand horse, 
<A NAME="343"></A>and not much fewer than forty thousand full-armed foot of the phalanx; 
<A NAME="344"></A>and planting himself along the seaside, at the foot of Mount Olympus, in 
<A NAME="345"></A>ground with no access on any side, and on all sides fortified with fences 
<A NAME="346"></A>and bulwarks of wood, remained in great security, thinking by delay and 
<A NAME="347"></A>expense to weary out Aemilius. But he, in the meantime, busy in thought, 
<A NAME="348"></A>weighed all counsels and all means of attack, and perceiving his soldiers, 
<A NAME="349"></A>from their former want of discipline, to be impatient of delay, and ready 
<A NAME="350"></A>on all occasions to teach their general his duty, rebuked them, and bade 
<A NAME="351"></A>them not meddle with what was not their concern, but only take care that 
<A NAME="352"></A>they and their arms were in readiness, and to use their swords like Romans 
<A NAME="353"></A>when their commander should think fit to employ them. Further, he ordered 
<A NAME="354"></A>that the sentinels by night should watch without javelins, that thus they 
<A NAME="355"></A>might be more careful and surer to resist sleep, having no arms to defend 
<A NAME="356"></A>themselves against any attacks of an enemy.
<A NAME="357"></A><BR><BR>What most annoyed the army was the want of water; for only a little, 
<A NAME="358"></A>and that foul, flowed out, or rather came by drops from a spring adjoining 
<A NAME="359"></A>the sea; but Aemilius, considering that he was at the foot of the high 
<A NAME="360"></A>and woody mountain Olympus, and conjecturing by the flourishing growth 
<A NAME="361"></A>of the trees that there were springs that had their course underground, 
<A NAME="362"></A>dug a great many holes and wells along the foot of the mountain, which 
<A NAME="363"></A>were presently filled with pure water escaping from its confinement into 
<A NAME="364"></A>the vacuum they afforded. Although there are some, indeed, who deny that 
<A NAME="365"></A>there are reservoirs of water lying ready provided out of sight, in the 
<A NAME="366"></A>places from whence springs flow, and that when they appear, they merely 
<A NAME="367"></A>issue and run out; on the contrary, they say, they are then formed and 
<A NAME="368"></A>come into existence for the first time, by the liquefaction of the surrounding 
<A NAME="369"></A>matter; and that this change is caused by density and cold, when the moist 
<A NAME="370"></A>vapour, by being closely pressed together, becomes fluid. As women's breasts 
<A NAME="371"></A>are not like vessels full of milk always prepared and ready to flow from 
<A NAME="372"></A>them; but their nourishment being changed in their breasts, is there made 
<A NAME="373"></A>milk, and from thence is pressed out. In like manner, places of the earth 
<A NAME="374"></A>that are cold and full of springs, do not contain any hidden waters or 
<A NAME="375"></A>receptacles which are capable, as from a source always ready and furnished, 
<A NAME="376"></A>of supplying all the brooks and deep rivers; but by compressing and condensing 
<A NAME="377"></A>the vapours and air they turn them into that substance. And thus places 
<A NAME="378"></A>that are dug open, flow by that pressure, and afford the more water (as 
<A NAME="379"></A>the breasts of women do milk by their being sucked), the vapour thus moistening 
<A NAME="380"></A>and becoming fluid; whereas ground that remains idle and undug is not capable 
<A NAME="381"></A>of producing any water, whilst it wants the motion which is the cause of 
<A NAME="382"></A>liquefaction. But those that assert this opinion give occasion to the doubtful 
<A NAME="383"></A>to argue, that on the same ground there should be no blood in living creatures, 
<A NAME="384"></A>but that it must be formed by the wound, some sort of spirit or flesh being 
<A NAME="385"></A>changed into a liquid and flowing matter. Moreover, they are refuted by 
<A NAME="386"></A>the fact that men who dig mines, either in sieges or for metals, meet with 
<A NAME="387"></A>rivers, which are not collected by little and little (as must necessarily 
<A NAME="388"></A>be, if they had their being at the very instant the earth was opened), 
<A NAME="389"></A>but break out at once with violence; and upon the cutting through a rock, 
<A NAME="390"></A>there often gush out great quantities of water, which then as suddenly 
<A NAME="391"></A>cease. But of this enough.
<A NAME="392"></A><BR><BR>Aemilius lay still for some days, and it is said that there were 
<A NAME="393"></A>never two great armies so nigh that enjoyed so much quiet. When he had 
<A NAME="394"></A>tried and considered all things, he was informed that there was yet one 
<A NAME="395"></A>passage left unguarded, through Perrhaebia by the temple of Apollo and 
<A NAME="396"></A>the Rock. Gathering, therefore, more hope from the place being left defenceless 
<A NAME="397"></A>than fear from the roughness and difficulty of the passage, he proposed 
<A NAME="398"></A>it for consultation. Amongst those that were present at the council, Scipio, 
<A NAME="399"></A>surnamed Nasica, son-in-law to Scipio Africanus, who afterwards was so 
<A NAME="400"></A>powerful in the senate-house, was the first that offered himself to command 
<A NAME="401"></A>those that should be sent to encompass the enemy. Next to him, Fabius Maximus, 
<A NAME="402"></A>eldest son of Aemilius, although yet very young, offered himself with great 
<A NAME="403"></A>zeal. Aemilius, rejoicing, gave them, not so many as Polybius states, but, 
<A NAME="404"></A>as Nasica himself tells us in a brief letter which he wrote to one of the 
<A NAME="405"></A>kings with an account of the expedition, three thousand Italians that were 
<A NAME="406"></A>not Romans, and his left wing consisting of five thousand. Taking with 
<A NAME="407"></A>him, besides these, one hundred and twenty horsemen, and two hundred Thracians 
<A NAME="408"></A>and Cretans intermixed that Harpalus had sent, he began his journey towards 
<A NAME="409"></A>the sea, and encamped near the temple of Hercules, as if he designed to 
<A NAME="410"></A>embark, and so to sail round and environ the enemy. But when the soldiers 
<A NAME="411"></A>had supped and it was dark, he made the captains acquainted with his real 
<A NAME="412"></A>intentions, and marching all night in the opposite directions away from 
<A NAME="413"></A>the sea, till he came under the temple of Apollo, there rested his army. 
<A NAME="414"></A>At this place Mount Olympus rises in height more than ten furlongs, as 
<A NAME="415"></A>appears by the epigram made by the man that measured 
<A NAME="416"></A>it:-
<A NAME="417"></A><BR><BR>"The summit of Olympus, at the site
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>Where stands Apollo's temple, has a height
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>Of full ten furlongs by the line, and more,
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>Ten furlongs, and one hundred feet, less four.
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>Eumelus's son, Xenagoras, reached the place.
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>Adieu, O king, and do thy pilgrim grace."
<A NAME="423"></A><BR><BR>It is allowed, say the geometricians, that no mountain in height 
<A NAME="424"></A>or sea in depth exceeds ten furlongs, and yet it seems probable that Xenagoras 
<A NAME="425"></A>did not take his admeasurement carelessly, but according to the rules of 
<A NAME="426"></A>art, and with instruments for the purpose. Here it was that Nasica passed 
<A NAME="427"></A>the night.
<A NAME="428"></A><BR><BR>A Cretan deserted, who fled to the enemy during the march, discovered 
<A NAME="429"></A>to Perseus the design which the Romans had to encompass him: for he, seeing 
<A NAME="430"></A>that Aemilius lay still, had not suspected any such attempt. He was startled 
<A NAME="431"></A>at the news, yet did not put his army in motion, but sent ten thousand 
<A NAME="432"></A>mercenary soldiers, and two thousand Macedonians, under command of Milo, 
<A NAME="433"></A>with order to hasten and possess themselves of the passes. Polybius relates 
<A NAME="434"></A>that the Romans found these men asleep when they attacked them; but Nasica 
<A NAME="435"></A>says there was a sharp and severe conflict on the top of the mountain, 
<A NAME="436"></A>that he himself encountered a mercenary Thracian, pierced him through with 
<A NAME="437"></A>his javelin, and slew him; and that the enemy being forced to retreat, 
<A NAME="438"></A>Milo stripped to his coat and fled shamefully without his armour, while 
<A NAME="439"></A>he followed without danger, and conveyed the whole army down into the 
<A NAME="440"></A>country.
<A NAME="441"></A><BR><BR>After this event, Perseus, now grown fearful, and fallen from his 
<A NAME="442"></A>hopes, removed his camp in all haste; he was under the necessity either 
<A NAME="443"></A>to stop before Pydna, and there run the hazard of a battle, or disperse 
<A NAME="444"></A>his army into cities, and there expect the event of the war, which, having 
<A NAME="445"></A>once made its way into his country, could not be driven out without great 
<A NAME="446"></A>slaughter and bloodshed. But Perseus, being told by his friends that he 
<A NAME="447"></A>was much superior in number, and that men fighting in the defence of their 
<A NAME="448"></A>wives and children must needs feel all the more courage, especially when 
<A NAME="449"></A>all was done in the sight of their king, who himself was engaged in equal 
<A NAME="450"></A>danger, was thus again encouraged; and, pitching his camp, prepared himself 
<A NAME="451"></A>to fight, viewed the country, and gave out the commands, as if he designed 
<A NAME="452"></A>to set upon the Romans as soon as they approached. The place was a field 
<A NAME="453"></A>fit for the action of a phalanx, which requires smooth standing and even 
<A NAME="454"></A>ground, and also had divers little hills, one joining another, fit for 
<A NAME="455"></A>the motions whether in retreat or advance of light troops and skirmishers. 
<A NAME="456"></A>Through the middle ran the rivers Aeson and Leucus, which though not very 
<A NAME="457"></A>deep, it being the latter end of summer, yet were likely enough to give 
<A NAME="458"></A>the Romans some trouble.
<A NAME="459"></A><BR><BR>As soon as Aemilius had rejoined Nasica, he advanced in battle 
<A NAME="460"></A>array against the enemy; but when he found how they were drawn up, and 
<A NAME="461"></A>the number of their forces, he regarded them with admiration and surprise, 
<A NAME="462"></A>and halted, considering within himself. The young commanders, eager to 
<A NAME="463"></A>fight, riding along by his side, pressed him not to delay, and most of 
<A NAME="464"></A>all Nasica, flushed with his late success on Olympus. To whom Aemilius 
<A NAME="465"></A>answered with a smile: "So would I do were I of your age; but many victories 
<A NAME="466"></A>have taught me the ways in which men are defeated, and forbid me to engage 
<A NAME="467"></A>soldiers weary with a long march against an army drawn up and prepared 
<A NAME="468"></A>for battle."
<A NAME="469"></A><BR><BR>Then he gave command that the front of his army, and such as were 
<A NAME="470"></A>in sight of the enemy, should form as if ready to engage, and those in 
<A NAME="471"></A>the rear should cast up the trenches and fortify the camp; so that the 
<A NAME="472"></A>hindmost in succession wheeling off by degrees and withdrawing, their whole 
<A NAME="473"></A>order was insensibly broken up, and the army encamped without noise or 
<A NAME="474"></A>trouble.
<A NAME="475"></A><BR><BR>When it was night, and, supper being over, all were turning to 
<A NAME="476"></A>sleep and rest, on a sudden the moon, which was then at full and high in 
<A NAME="477"></A>the heavens, grew dark, and by degrees losing her light, passed through 
<A NAME="478"></A>various colours, and at length was totally eclipsed. The Romans, according 
<A NAME="479"></A>to their custom, clattering brass pans and lifting up fire-brands and torches 
<A NAME="480"></A>into the air, invoked the return of her light; the Macedonians behaved 
<A NAME="481"></A>far otherwise: terror and amazement seized their whole army, and a rumour 
<A NAME="482"></A>crept by degrees into their camp that this eclipse portended even that 
<A NAME="483"></A>of their king. Aemilius was no novice in these things, nor was ignorant 
<A NAME="484"></A>of the nature of the seeming irregularities of eclipses- that in a certain 
<A NAME="485"></A>revolution of time, the moon in her course enters the shadow of the earth 
<A NAME="486"></A>and is there obscured, till, passing the region of darkness, she is again 
<A NAME="487"></A>enlightened by the sun. Yet being a devout man, a religious observer of 
<A NAME="488"></A>sacrifices and the art of divination, as soon as he perceived the moon 
<A NAME="489"></A>beginning to regain her former lustre, he offered up to her eleven heifers. 
<A NAME="490"></A>At the break of day he sacrificed as many as twenty in succession to Hercules, 
<A NAME="491"></A>without any token that his offering was accepted; but at the one-and-twentieth, 
<A NAME="492"></A>the signs promised victory to defenders. He then vowed a hecatomb and solemn 
<A NAME="493"></A>sports to Hercules, and commanded his captains to make ready for battle, 
<A NAME="494"></A>staying only till the sun should decline and come round to the west, lest, 
<A NAME="495"></A>being in their faces in the morning, it should dazzle the eyes of his soldiers. 
<A NAME="496"></A>Thus he whiled away the time in his tent, which was open towards the plain 
<A NAME="497"></A>where his enemies were encamped.
<A NAME="498"></A><BR><BR>When it grew towards evening, some tell us, Aemilius himself used 
<A NAME="499"></A>a stratagem to induce the enemy to begin the fight; that he turned loose 
<A NAME="500"></A>a horse without a bridle, and sent some of the Romans to catch him, upon 
<A NAME="501"></A>whose following the beast the battle began. Others relate that the Thracians, 
<A NAME="502"></A>under the command of one Alexander, set upon the Roman beasts of burden 
<A NAME="503"></A>that were bringing forage to the camp; that to oppose these, a party of 
<A NAME="504"></A>seven hundred Ligurians were immediately detached; and that, relief coming 
<A NAME="505"></A>still from both armies, the main bodies at last engaged. Aemilius, like 
<A NAME="506"></A>a wise pilot, foreseeing by the present waves and motion of the armies 
<A NAME="507"></A>the greatness of the following storm, came out of his tent, went through 
<A NAME="508"></A>the legions, and encouraged his soldiers. Nasica, in the meantime, who 
<A NAME="509"></A>had ridden out to the skirmishers, saw the whole force of the enemy on 
<A NAME="510"></A>the point of engaging. First marched the Thracians, who, he himself tells 
<A NAME="511"></A>us, inspired him with most terror; they were of great stature, with bright 
<A NAME="512"></A>and glittering shields and black frocks under them, their legs armed with 
<A NAME="513"></A>greaves, and they brandished, as they moved, straight and heavily-ironed 
<A NAME="514"></A>spears over their right shoulders. Next the Thracians marched the mercenary 
<A NAME="515"></A>soldiers, armed after different fashions; with these Paeonians were mingled. 
<A NAME="516"></A>These were succeeded by a third division, of picked men, native Macedonians, 
<A NAME="517"></A>the choicest for courage and strength, in the prime of life, gleaming with 
<A NAME="518"></A>gilt armour and scarlet coats. As these were taking their places they were 
<A NAME="519"></A>followed from the camp by the troops in phalanx called the Brazen Shields, 
<A NAME="520"></A>so that the whole plain seemed alive with the flashing of steel and the 
<A NAME="521"></A>glistening of brass; and the hills also with their shouts, as they cheered 
<A NAME="522"></A>each other on. In this order they marched, and with such boldness and speed, 
<A NAME="523"></A>that those that were first slain died at but two furlongs distance from 
<A NAME="524"></A>the Roman camp.
<A NAME="525"></A><BR><BR>The battle being begun, Aemilius came in and found that the foremost 
<A NAME="526"></A>of the Macedonians had already fixed the ends of their spears into the 
<A NAME="527"></A>shields of his Romans, so that it was impossible to come near them with 
<A NAME="528"></A>their swords. When he saw this, and observed that the rest of the Macedonians 
<A NAME="529"></A>took the targets that hung on their left shoulders, and brought them round 
<A NAME="530"></A>before them, and all at once stooped their pikes against their enemies' 
<A NAME="531"></A>shields, and considered the great strength of this wall of shields, and 
<A NAME="532"></A>the formidable appearance of a front thus bristling with arms, he was seized 
<A NAME="533"></A>with amazement and alarm; nothing he had ever seen before had been equal 
<A NAME="534"></A>to it; and in aftertimes he frequently used to speak both of the sight 
<A NAME="535"></A>and of his own sensations. These, however, he dissembled, and rode through 
<A NAME="536"></A>his army without either breastplate or helmet, with a serene and cheerful 
<A NAME="537"></A>countenance.
<A NAME="538"></A><BR><BR>On the contrary, as Polybius relates, no sooner was the battle 
<A NAME="539"></A>begun, but the Macedonian king basely withdrew to the city Pydna, under 
<A NAME="540"></A>a pretence of sacrificing to Hercules; a god that is not wont to regard 
<A NAME="541"></A>the faint offerings of cowards, or to fulfil unsanctioned vows. For truly 
<A NAME="542"></A>it can hardly be a thing that heaven would sanction, that he that never 
<A NAME="543"></A>shoots should carry away the prize; he triumph that slinks from the battle; 
<A NAME="544"></A>he that takes no pains meet with success, or the wicked man prosper. But 
<A NAME="545"></A>to Aemilius's petitions the god listened; he prayed for victory with his 
<A NAME="546"></A>sword in his hand, and fought while entreating divine 
<A NAME="547"></A>assistance.
<A NAME="548"></A><BR><BR>A certain Posidonius, who has at some length written a history 
<A NAME="549"></A>of Perseus, and professes to have lived at the time, and to have been himself 
<A NAME="550"></A>engaged in these events, denies that Perseus left the field either through 
<A NAME="551"></A>fear or pretence of sacrificing, but that, the very day before the fight, 
<A NAME="552"></A>he received a kick from a horse on his thigh; that though very much disabled, 
<A NAME="553"></A>and dissuaded by all his friends, he commanded one of his riding-horses 
<A NAME="554"></A>to be brought, and entered the field unarmed; that amongst an infinite 
<A NAME="555"></A>number of darts that flew about on all sides, one of iron lighted on him, 
<A NAME="556"></A>and though not with the point, yet by a glance struck him with such force 
<A NAME="557"></A>on his left side that it tore his clothes and so bruised his flesh that 
<A NAME="558"></A>the mark remained a long time after. This is what Posidonius says in defence 
<A NAME="559"></A>of Perseus.
<A NAME="560"></A><BR><BR>The Romans not being able to make a breach in the phalanx, one 
<A NAME="561"></A>Salius, a commander of the Pelignians, snatched the ensign of his company 
<A NAME="562"></A>and threw it amongst the enemies; on seeing which, the Pelignians (as amongst 
<A NAME="563"></A>the Italians it is always thought the greatest breach of honour to abandon 
<A NAME="564"></A>a standard) rushed with great violence towards the place, where the conflict 
<A NAME="565"></A>grew very fierce and the slaughter terrible on both sides. For these endeavoured 
<A NAME="566"></A>to cut the spears asunder with their swords, or to beat them back with 
<A NAME="567"></A>their shields, or put them by with their hands; and, on the other side, 
<A NAME="568"></A>the Macedonians held their long sarissas in both hands, and pierced those 
<A NAME="569"></A>that came in their way quite through their armour, no shield or corslet 
<A NAME="570"></A>being able to resist the force of that weapon. The Pelignians and Marrucinians 
<A NAME="571"></A>were thrown headlong to the ground, having without consideration, with 
<A NAME="572"></A>mere animal fury, rushed upon a certain death. Their first ranks being 
<A NAME="573"></A>slain, those that were behind were forced to give back; it cannot be said 
<A NAME="574"></A>they fled, but they retreated towards Mount Olocrus. When, Aemilius saw 
<A NAME="575"></A>this, Posidonius relates, he rent his clothes, some of his men being ready 
<A NAME="576"></A>to fly, and the rest not willing to engage with a phalanx into which they 
<A NAME="577"></A>could not hope to make any entrance- a sort of palisade, as it were, impregnable 
<A NAME="578"></A>and unapproachable, with its close array of long spears everywhere meeting 
<A NAME="579"></A>the assailant. Nevertheless, the unequalness of the ground would not permit 
<A NAME="580"></A>a widely extended front to be so exactly drawn up as to have their shields 
<A NAME="581"></A>everywhere joined; and Aemilius perceived that there were a great many 
<A NAME="582"></A>interstices and breaches in the Macedonian phalanx, as it usually happens 
<A NAME="583"></A>in all great armies, according to the different efforts of the combatants, 
<A NAME="584"></A>who in one part press forward with eagerness, and in another are forced 
<A NAME="585"></A>to fall back. Taking, therefore, this occasion, with all speed he broke 
<A NAME="586"></A>up his men into their cohorts, and gave them order to fall into the intervals 
<A NAME="587"></A>and openings of the enemy's body, and not to make one general attack upon 
<A NAME="588"></A>them all, but to engage, as they were divided, in several partial battles. 
<A NAME="589"></A>These commands Aemilius gave to his captains, and they to their soldiers; 
<A NAME="590"></A>and no sooner had they entered the spaces and separated their enemies, 
<A NAME="591"></A>but they charged them, some on their sides where they were naked and exposed, 
<A NAME="592"></A>and others, making a circuit, behind; and thus destroyed the force of the 
<A NAME="593"></A>phalanx, which consists in common action and close union. And now, come 
<A NAME="594"></A>to fight man to man, or in small parties, the Macedonians smote in vain 
<A NAME="595"></A>upon firm and long shields with their little swords, whilst their slight 
<A NAME="596"></A>bucklers were not able to sustain the weight and force of the Roman swords, 
<A NAME="597"></A>which pierced through all their armour to their bodies; they turned, in 
<A NAME="598"></A>fine, and fled.
<A NAME="599"></A><BR><BR>The conflict was obstinate. And here Marcus, the son of Cato, and 
<A NAME="600"></A>son-in-law of Aemilius, whilst he showed all possible courage, let fall 
<A NAME="601"></A>his sword. Being a young man carefully brought up and disciplined, and, 
<A NAME="602"></A>son of so renowned a father, bound to give proof of more than ordinary 
<A NAME="603"></A>virtue, he thought his life but a burden, should he live and permit his 
<A NAME="604"></A>enemies to enjoy this spoil. He hurried hither and thither, and wherever 
<A NAME="605"></A>he espied a friend or companion, declared his misfortune, and begged their 
<A NAME="606"></A>assistance; a considerable number of brave men being thus collected, with 
<A NAME="607"></A>one accord they made their way through their fellows after their leader, 
<A NAME="608"></A>and fell upon the enemy; whom after a sharp conflict, many wounds, and 
<A NAME="609"></A>much slaughter, they repulsed, possessed the place that was now deserted 
<A NAME="610"></A>and free, and set themselves to search for the sword, which at last they 
<A NAME="611"></A>found covered with a great heap of arms and dead bodies. Overjoyed with 
<A NAME="612"></A>this success, they raised the song of triumph, and, with more eagerness 
<A NAME="613"></A>than ever, charged the foes that yet remained firm and unbroken. In the 
<A NAME="614"></A>end, three thousand of the chosen men, who kept their ground and fought 
<A NAME="615"></A>valiantly to the last, were all cut in pieces, while the slaughter of such 
<A NAME="616"></A>as fled was also very great. The plain and the lower part of the hills 
<A NAME="617"></A>were filled with dead bodies, and the water of the river Leucus, which 
<A NAME="618"></A>the Romans did not pass till the next day after the battle, was then mingled 
<A NAME="619"></A>with blood. For it is said there fell more than twenty-five thousand of 
<A NAME="620"></A>the enemy; of the Romans, as Posidonius relates, a hundred; as Nasica, 
<A NAME="621"></A>only fourscore. This battle, though so great, was very quickly decided, 
<A NAME="622"></A>it being three in the afternoon when they first engaged, and not four when 
<A NAME="623"></A>the enemy was vanquished; the rest of the day was spent in pursuit of the 
<A NAME="624"></A>fugitives, whom they followed about thirteen or fourteen miles, so that 
<A NAME="625"></A>it was far in the night when they returned.
<A NAME="626"></A><BR><BR>All the others were met by their servants with torches, and brought 
<A NAME="627"></A>back with joy and great triumph to their tents, which were set out with 
<A NAME="628"></A>lights, and decked with wreaths of ivy and laurel. But the general himself 
<A NAME="629"></A>was in great grief. Of the two sons that served under him in the war, the 
<A NAME="630"></A>youngest was missing, whom he held most dear, and whose courage and good 
<A NAME="631"></A>qualities he perceived much to excel those of his brothers. Bold and eager 
<A NAME="632"></A>for distinction, and still a mere child in age, he concluded that he had 
<A NAME="633"></A>perished, whilst for want of experience he had engaged himself too far 
<A NAME="634"></A>amongst his enemies. His sorrow and fears became known to the army; the 
<A NAME="635"></A>soldiers, quitting their suppers, ran about with lights, some to Aemilius's 
<A NAME="636"></A>tent, some out of the trenches, to seek him amongst such as were slain 
<A NAME="637"></A>in the first onset. There was nothing but grief in the camp, and the plain 
<A NAME="638"></A>was filled with the cries of men calling out for Scipio; for, from his 
<A NAME="639"></A>very youth, he was an object of admiration; endowed above any of his equals 
<A NAME="640"></A>with the good qualities requisite either for command or counsel. At length, 
<A NAME="641"></A>when it was late, and they almost despaired, he returned from the pursuit 
<A NAME="642"></A>with only two or three of his companions all covered with the fresh blood 
<A NAME="643"></A>of his enemies, having been, like some dog of noble breed, carried away 
<A NAME="644"></A>by the pleasure, greater than he could control, of his first victory. This 
<A NAME="645"></A>was that Scipio that afterwards destroyed Carthage and Numantia, and was, 
<A NAME="646"></A>without dispute, the first of the Romans in merit, and had the greatest 
<A NAME="647"></A>authority amongst them. Thus Fortune, deferring her displeasure and jealousy 
<A NAME="648"></A>of such great success to some other time, let Aemilius at present enjoy 
<A NAME="649"></A>this victory, without any detraction or diminution.
<A NAME="650"></A><BR><BR>As for Perseus, from Pydna he fled to Pella with his cavalry, which 
<A NAME="651"></A>was as yet almost entire. But when the foot came up with them, and, upbraiding 
<A NAME="652"></A>them as cowards and traitors, tried to pull them off their horses, and 
<A NAME="653"></A>fell to blows, Perseus, fearing the tumult, forsook the common road, and, 
<A NAME="654"></A>lest he should be known, pulled off his purple, and carried it before him, 
<A NAME="655"></A>and took his crown in his hand and, that he might the better converse with 
<A NAME="656"></A>his friends, alighted from his horse and led him. Of those that were about 
<A NAME="657"></A>him, one stopped, pretending to tie his shoe that was loose, another to 
<A NAME="658"></A>water his horse, a third to drink himself; and thus lagging behind, by 
<A NAME="659"></A>degrees left him, they having not so much reason to fear their enemies 
<A NAME="660"></A>as his cruelty; for he, disordered by his misfortune, sought to clear himself 
<A NAME="661"></A>by laying the cause of the overthrow upon everybody else. He arrived at 
<A NAME="662"></A>Pella in the night, where Euctus and Eudaeus, two of his treasurers, came 
<A NAME="663"></A>to him, and, what with their reflecting on his former faults, and their 
<A NAME="664"></A>free and ill-timed admonitions and counsels, so exasperated him, that he 
<A NAME="665"></A>killed them both, stabbing them with his own dagger. After this, nobody 
<A NAME="666"></A>stuck to him but Evander the Cretan, Archedemus the Aetolian, and Neon 
<A NAME="667"></A>the Boeotian. Of the common soldiers there followed him only those from 
<A NAME="668"></A>Crete, not out of any good-will, but because they were as constant to his 
<A NAME="669"></A>riches as the bees to their hive. For he carried a great treasure with 
<A NAME="670"></A>him, out of which he had suffered them to take cups, bowls, and other vessels 
<A NAME="671"></A>of silver and gold, to the value of fifty talents. But when he was come 
<A NAME="672"></A>to Amphipolis, and afterwards to Galepsus, and his fears were a little 
<A NAME="673"></A>abated, he relapsed into his old and constitutional disease of covetousness, 
<A NAME="674"></A>and lamented to his friends that he had, through inadvertency, allowed 
<A NAME="675"></A>some gold plate which had belonged to Alexander the Great to go into the 
<A NAME="676"></A>hands of the Cretans, and besought those that had it, with tears in his 
<A NAME="677"></A>eyes, to exchange with him again for money. Those that understood him thoroughly 
<A NAME="678"></A>knew very well that he only played the Cretan with the Cretans, but those 
<A NAME="679"></A>that believed him, and restored what they had, were cheated; as he not 
<A NAME="680"></A>only did not pay the money, but by craft got thirty talents more of his 
<A NAME="681"></A>friends into his hands (which in a short time after fell to the enemy), 
<A NAME="682"></A>and with them sailed to Samothrace, and there fled to the temple of Castor 
<A NAME="683"></A>and Pollux for refuge.
<A NAME="684"></A><BR><BR>The Macedonians were always accounted great lovers of their kings, 
<A NAME="685"></A>but now, as if their chief prop was broken, they all gave way together, 
<A NAME="686"></A>and submitted to Aemilius, and in two days made him master of their whole 
<A NAME="687"></A>country. This seems to confirm the opinion which ascribes whatever he did 
<A NAME="688"></A>to good fortune. The omen, also, that happened at Amphipolis has a supernatural 
<A NAME="689"></A>character. When he was. sacrificing there, and the holy rites were just 
<A NAME="690"></A>begun, on a sudden, lightning fell upon the altar, set the wood on fire, 
<A NAME="691"></A>and completed the immolation of the sacrifice. The most signal manifestation, 
<A NAME="692"></A>however, of preternatural agency appears in the story of the rumour of 
<A NAME="693"></A>his success. For on the fourth day after Perseus was vanquished at Pydna, 
<A NAME="694"></A>whilst the people at Rome were seeing the horse-races, a report suddenly 
<A NAME="695"></A>rose at the entrance of the theatre that Aemilius had defeated Perseus 
<A NAME="696"></A>in a great battle, and was reducing all Macedonia under his power; and 
<A NAME="697"></A>from thence it spread amongst the people, and created general joy, with 
<A NAME="698"></A>shoutings and acclamations for that whole day through the city. But when 
<A NAME="699"></A>no certain author was found of the news, and every one alike had taken 
<A NAME="700"></A>it at random, it was abandoned for the present and thought no more of, 
<A NAME="701"></A>until, a few days after, certain intelligence came, and then the first 
<A NAME="702"></A>was looked upon as no less than a miracle, having, under an appearance 
<A NAME="703"></A>of fiction, contained what was real and true. It is reported also, that 
<A NAME="704"></A>the news of the battle fought in Italy, near the river Sagra, was conveyed 
<A NAME="705"></A>into Peloponnesus the same day, and of that at Mycale against the Medes, 
<A NAME="706"></A>to Plataea. When the Romans had defeated the Tarquins, who were combined 
<A NAME="707"></A>with the Latins, a little after there were seen at Rome two tall and comely 
<A NAME="708"></A>men, who professed to bring the news from the camp. They were conjectured 
<A NAME="709"></A>to be Castor and Pollux. The first man that spoke to them in the forum, 
<A NAME="710"></A>near the fountain where they were cooling their horses, which were all 
<A NAME="711"></A>of a foam, expressed surprise at the report of the victory, when, it is 
<A NAME="712"></A>said, they smiled, and gently touched his beard with their hands, the hair 
<A NAME="713"></A>of which from being black was, on the spot, changed to yellow. This gave 
<A NAME="714"></A>credit to what they said, and fixed the name of Ahenobarbus, or Brazen-beard, 
<A NAME="715"></A>on the man. And a thing which happened in our own time will make all these 
<A NAME="716"></A>credible. For when Antonius rebelled against Domitian, and Rome was in 
<A NAME="717"></A>consternation, expecting great wars from the quarter of Germany, all on 
<A NAME="718"></A>a sudden, and nobody knows upon what account, the people spontaneously 
<A NAME="719"></A>gave out a rumour of victory, and the news ran current through the city, 
<A NAME="720"></A>that Antonius himself was slain, his whole army destroyed, and not so much 
<A NAME="721"></A>as a part of it escaped; nay, this belief was so strong and positive, that 
<A NAME="722"></A>many of the magistrates offered up sacrifice. But when, at length, the 
<A NAME="723"></A>author was sought for, and none was to be found, it vanished by degrees, 
<A NAME="724"></A>every one shifting it off from himself to another, and, at last, was lost 
<A NAME="725"></A>in the numberless crowd, as in a vast ocean, and, having no solid ground 
<A NAME="726"></A>to support its credit, was in a short time not so much as named in the 
<A NAME="727"></A>city. Nevertheless, when Domitian marched out with his forces to the war, 
<A NAME="728"></A>he met with messengers and letters that gave him a relation of the victory; 
<A NAME="729"></A>and the rumour, it was found, had come the very day it was gained, though 
<A NAME="730"></A>the distance between the places was more than twenty-five hundred miles. 
<A NAME="731"></A>The truth of this no man of our time is ignorant of.
<A NAME="732"></A><BR><BR>But to proceed. Cnaeus Octavius, who was joined in command with 
<A NAME="733"></A>Aemilius, came to an anchor with his fleet under Samothrace, where, out 
<A NAME="734"></A>of respect to the gods, he permitted Perseus to enjoy the benefit of refuge, 
<A NAME="735"></A>but took care that he should not escape by sea. Notwithstanding, Perseus 
<A NAME="736"></A>secretly persuaded Oroandes of Crete, master of a small vessel, to convey 
<A NAME="737"></A>him and his treasure away. He, however, playing the true Cretan, took in 
<A NAME="738"></A>the treasure, and bade him come, in the night, with his children and most 
<A NAME="739"></A>necessary attendants, to the port by the temple of Ceres; but, as soon 
<A NAME="740"></A>as it was evening, set sail without him. It had been sad enough for Perseus 
<A NAME="741"></A>to be forced to let down himself, his wife, and children through a narrow 
<A NAME="742"></A>window by a wall- people altogether unaccustomed to hardship and flying; 
<A NAME="743"></A>but that which drew a far sadder sigh from his heart was, when he was told 
<A NAME="744"></A>by a man, as he wandered on the shore, that he had seen Oroandes under 
<A NAME="745"></A>sail in the main sea, it being now about daybreak. So, there being no hopes 
<A NAME="746"></A>left of escaping, he fled back again to the wall, which he and his wife 
<A NAME="747"></A>recovered, though they were seen by the Romans, before they could reach 
<A NAME="748"></A>them. His children he himself had delivered into the hands of Ion, one 
<A NAME="749"></A>that had been his favourite, but now proved his betrayer, and was the chief 
<A NAME="750"></A>cause that forced him (beasts themselves will do so when their young ones 
<A NAME="751"></A>are taken) to come and yield himself up to those that had them in their 
<A NAME="752"></A>power. His greatest confidence was in Nasica, and it was for him he called, 
<A NAME="753"></A>but he not being there, he bewailed his misfortune, and, seeing there was 
<A NAME="754"></A>no possible remedy, surrendered himself to Octavius. And here, in particular, 
<A NAME="755"></A>he made it manifest that he was possessed with a vice more sordid than 
<A NAME="756"></A>covetousness itself, namely, the fondness of life; by which he deprived 
<A NAME="757"></A>himself even of pity, the only thing that fortune never takes away from 
<A NAME="758"></A>the most wretched. He desired to be brought to Aemilius, who arose from 
<A NAME="759"></A>his seat, and, accompanied with his friends, went to receive him, with 
<A NAME="760"></A>tears in his eyes, as a great man fallen by the anger of the gods and his 
<A NAME="761"></A>own ill-fortune; when Perseus- the most shameful of sights- threw himself 
<A NAME="762"></A>at his feet, embraced his knees, and uttered unmanly cries and petitions, 
<A NAME="763"></A>such as Aemilius was not able to bear, nor would vouchsafe to hear: but 
<A NAME="764"></A>looking on him with a sad and angry countenance he said, "Why, unhappy 
<A NAME="765"></A>man, do you thus take pains to exonerate fortune of your heaviest charge 
<A NAME="766"></A>against her, by conduct that will make it seem that you are not unjustly 
<A NAME="767"></A>in calamity, and that it is not your present condition, but your former 
<A NAME="768"></A>happiness, that was more than your deserts? And why depreciate also my 
<A NAME="769"></A>victory, and make my conquests insignificant, by proving yourself a coward, 
<A NAME="770"></A>and a foe beneath a Roman? Distressed valour challenges great respect, 
<A NAME="771"></A>even from enemies; but cowardice, though never so successful, from the 
<A NAME="772"></A>Romans has always met with scorn." Yet for all this he took him up, gave 
<A NAME="773"></A>him his hand, and delivered him into the custody of Tubero. Meantime, he 
<A NAME="774"></A>himself carried his sons, his sons-in-law, and others of chief rank, especially 
<A NAME="775"></A>of the younger sort, back with him into his tent, where for a long time 
<A NAME="776"></A>he sat down without speaking one word, insomuch that they all wondered 
<A NAME="777"></A>at him. At last, he began to discourse of fortune and human affairs. "Is 
<A NAME="778"></A>it meet," said he, "for him that knows he is but man, in his greatest prosperity 
<A NAME="779"></A>to pride himself, and be exalted at the conquest of a city, nation, or 
<A NAME="780"></A>kingdom, and not rather well to weigh this change of fortune, in which 
<A NAME="781"></A>all warriors may see an example of their common frailty, and learn a lesson 
<A NAME="782"></A>that there is nothing durable or constant? For what time can men select 
<A NAME="783"></A>to think themselves secure, when that of victory itself forces us more 
<A NAME="784"></A>than any to dread our own fortune? and a very little consideration on the 
<A NAME="785"></A>law of things, and how all are hurried round, and each man's station changed, 
<A NAME="786"></A>will introduce sadness in the midst of the greatest joy. Or can you, when 
<A NAME="787"></A>you see before your eyes the succession of Alexander himself, who arrived 
<A NAME="788"></A>at the height of power and ruled the greatest empire, in the short space 
<A NAME="789"></A>of an hour trodden underfoot- when you behold a king, that was but even 
<A NAME="790"></A>now surrounded with so numerous an army, receiving nourishment to support 
<A NAME="791"></A>his life from the hands of his conquerors- can you, I say, believe there 
<A NAME="792"></A>is any certainty in what we now possess whilst there is such a thing as 
<A NAME="793"></A>chance? No, young men, cast off that vain pride and empty boast of victory; 
<A NAME="794"></A>sit down with humility, looking always for what is yet to come, and the 
<A NAME="795"></A>possible future reverses which the divine displeasure may eventually make 
<A NAME="796"></A>the end of our present happiness." It is said that Aemilius, having spoken 
<A NAME="797"></A>much more to the same purpose, dismissed the young men properly humbled, 
<A NAME="798"></A>and with their vainglory and insolence thoroughly chastened and curbed 
<A NAME="799"></A>by his address.
<A NAME="800"></A><BR><BR>When this was done, he put his army into garrisons, to refresh 
<A NAME="801"></A>themselves, and went himself to visit Greece, and to spend a short time 
<A NAME="802"></A>in relaxations equally honourable and humane. For as he passed, he eased 
<A NAME="803"></A>the people's grievances, reformed their governments, and bestowed gifts 
<A NAME="804"></A>upon them; to some corn, to others oil out of the king's storehouses, in 
<A NAME="805"></A>which, they report, there were such vast quantities laid up, that receivers 
<A NAME="806"></A>and petitioners were lacking before they could be exhausted. In Delphi 
<A NAME="807"></A>he found a great square pillar of white marble, designed for the pedestal 
<A NAME="808"></A>of King Perseus's golden statue, on which he commanded his own to be placed, 
<A NAME="809"></A>alleging that it was but just that the conquered should give place to the 
<A NAME="810"></A>conquerors. In Olympia he is said to have uttered the saying everybody 
<A NAME="811"></A>has heard, that Phidias had carved Homer's Jupiter. When the ten commissioners 
<A NAME="812"></A>arrived from Rome, he delivered up again to the Macedonians their cities 
<A NAME="813"></A>and country, granting them to live at liberty, and according to their own 
<A NAME="814"></A>laws, only paying the Romans the tribute of a hundred talents, double which 
<A NAME="815"></A>sum they had been wont to pay to their kings. Then he celebrated all manner 
<A NAME="816"></A>of shows and games, and sacrifices to the gods, and made great entertainments 
<A NAME="817"></A>and feasts; the charge of all which he liberally defrayed out of the king's 
<A NAME="818"></A>treasury; and showed that he understood the ordering and placing of his 
<A NAME="819"></A>guests, and how every man should be received, answerably to their rank 
<A NAME="820"></A>and quality, with such nice exactness, that the Greeks were full of wonder, 
<A NAME="821"></A>finding the care of these matters of pleasure did not escape him, and that 
<A NAME="822"></A>though involved in such important business, he could observe correctness 
<A NAME="823"></A>in these trifles. Nor was it least gratifying to him, that, amidst all 
<A NAME="824"></A>the magnificent and splendid preparations, he himself was always the most 
<A NAME="825"></A>grateful sight, and greatest pleasure to those he entertained. And he told 
<A NAME="826"></A>those that seemed to wonder at his diligence, that there was the same spirit 
<A NAME="827"></A>shown in marshalling, a banquet as an army; in rendering the one formidable 
<A NAME="828"></A>to the enemy, the other acceptable to the guests. Nor did men less praise 
<A NAME="829"></A>his liberality, and the greatness of his soul, than his other virtues; 
<A NAME="830"></A>for he would not so much as see those great quantities of silver and gold, 
<A NAME="831"></A>which were heaped together out of the king's palaces, but delivered them 
<A NAME="832"></A>to the quaestors, to be put into the public treasury. He only permitted 
<A NAME="833"></A>his own sons, who were great lovers of learning, to take the king's books; 
<A NAME="834"></A>and when he distributed rewards due to extraordinary valour, he gave his 
<A NAME="835"></A>son-in-law, Aelius Tubero, a bowl that weighed five pounds. This is that 
<A NAME="836"></A>Tubero we have already mentioned, who was one of sixteen relations that 
<A NAME="837"></A>lived together, and were all maintained out of one little farm; and it 
<A NAME="838"></A>is said that this was the first plate that ever entered the house of the 
<A NAME="839"></A>Aelii, brought thither as an honour and reward of virtue; before this time, 
<A NAME="840"></A>neither they nor their wives ever made use either of silver or 
<A NAME="841"></A>gold.
<A NAME="842"></A><BR><BR>Having thus settled everything well, taking his leave of the Greeks, 
<A NAME="843"></A>and exhorting the Macedonians, that, mindful of the liberty they had received 
<A NAME="844"></A>from the Romans, they should endeavour to maintain it by their obedience 
<A NAME="845"></A>to the laws, and concord amongst themselves, he departed for Epirus, having 
<A NAME="846"></A>orders from the senate to give the soldiers that followed him in the war 
<A NAME="847"></A>against Perseus the pillage of the cities of that country. That he might 
<A NAME="848"></A>set upon them all at once by surprise and unawares, he summoned ten of 
<A NAME="849"></A>the principal men out of each, whom he commanded, on such an appointed 
<A NAME="850"></A>day, to bring all the gold and silver they had either in their private 
<A NAME="851"></A>houses or temples; and, with every one of these, as if it were for this 
<A NAME="852"></A>very purpose, and under a pretence of searching for and receiving the gold, 
<A NAME="853"></A>he sent a centurion and a guard of soldiers; who, the set day being come, 
<A NAME="854"></A>rose all at once, and at the very self-same time fell upon them, and proceeded 
<A NAME="855"></A>to ransack the cities; so that in one hour a hundred and fifty thousand 
<A NAME="856"></A>persons were made slaves, and threescore and ten cities sacked. Yet what 
<A NAME="857"></A>was given to each soldier, out of so vast a destruction and utter ruin, 
<A NAME="858"></A>amounted to no more than eleven drachmas; so that men could only shudder 
<A NAME="859"></A>at the issue of a war, where the wealth of a whole nation thus divided 
<A NAME="860"></A>turned to so little advantage and profit to each particular 
<A NAME="861"></A>man.
<A NAME="862"></A><BR><BR>When Aemilius had done this- an action perfectly contrary to his 
<A NAME="863"></A>gentle and mild nature- he went down to Oricus, where he embarked his army 
<A NAME="864"></A>for Italy. He sailed up the river Tiber in the king's galley, that had 
<A NAME="865"></A>sixteen banks of oars, and was richly adorned with captured arms and with 
<A NAME="866"></A>cloths of purple and scarlet; so that, the vessel rowing slowly against 
<A NAME="867"></A>the stream, the Romans that crowded on the shore to meet him had a foretaste 
<A NAME="868"></A>of his following triumph. But the soldiers, who had cast a covetous eye 
<A NAME="869"></A>on the treasures of Perseus, when they did not obtain as much as they thought 
<A NAME="870"></A>they deserved, were secretly enraged and angry with Aemilius for this, 
<A NAME="871"></A>but openly complained that he had been a severe and tyrannical commander 
<A NAME="872"></A>over them; nor were they ready to show their desire of his triumph. When 
<A NAME="873"></A>Servius Galba, who was Aemilius's enemy, though he commanded as tribune 
<A NAME="874"></A>under him, understood this, he had the boldness plainly to affirm that 
<A NAME="875"></A>a triumph was not to be allowed him; and sowed various calumnies amongst 
<A NAME="876"></A>the soldiers, which yet further increased their ill-will. Nay more, he 
<A NAME="877"></A>desired the tribunes of the people, because the four hours that were remaining 
<A NAME="878"></A>of the day could not suffice for the accusation, to let him put it off 
<A NAME="879"></A>till another. But when the tribunes commanded him to speak then, if he 
<A NAME="880"></A>had anything to say, he began a long oration, filled with all manner of 
<A NAME="881"></A>reproaches, in which he spent the remaining part of the time, and the tribunes, 
<A NAME="882"></A>when it was dark, dismissed the assembly. The soldiers growing more vehement 
<A NAME="883"></A>on this, thronged all to Galba, and entering into a conspiracy, early in 
<A NAME="884"></A>the morning beset the capitol, where the tribunes had appointed the following 
<A NAME="885"></A>assembly to be held.
<A NAME="886"></A><BR><BR>As soon as it was day it was put to the vote, and the first tribe 
<A NAME="887"></A>was proceeding to refuse the triumph; and the news spread amongst the people 
<A NAME="888"></A>and to the senate. The people were indeed much grieved that Aemilius should 
<A NAME="889"></A>meet with such ignominy; but this was only in words, which had no effect. 
<A NAME="890"></A>The chief of the senate exclaimed against it as a base action, and excited 
<A NAME="891"></A>one another to repress the boldness and insolence of the soldiers, which 
<A NAME="892"></A>would ere long become altogether ungovernable and violent, were they now 
<A NAME="893"></A>permitted to deprive Aemilius of his triumph. Forcing a passage through 
<A NAME="894"></A>the crowd, they came up in great numbers, and desired the tribunes to defer 
<A NAME="895"></A>polling till they had spoken what they had to say to the people. All things 
<A NAME="896"></A>thus suspended, and silence being made, Marcus Servilius stood up, a man 
<A NAME="897"></A>of consular dignity, and who had killed twenty-three of his enemies that 
<A NAME="898"></A>had challenged him in single combat. "It is now more than ever," said he, 
<A NAME="899"></A>"clear to my mind how great a commander our Aemilius Paulus is, when I 
<A NAME="900"></A>see he was able to perform such famous and great exploits with an army 
<A NAME="901"></A>so full of sedition and baseness; nor can I sufficiently wonder, that a 
<A NAME="902"></A>people that seemed to glory in the triumphs over Illyrians and Ligurians, 
<A NAME="903"></A>should now through envy refuse to see the Macedonian king led alive, and 
<A NAME="904"></A>all the glory of Philip and Alexander, in captivity to the Roman power. 
<A NAME="905"></A>For is it not a strange thing for you, who upon a slight rumour of victory 
<A NAME="906"></A>that came by chance into the city, did offer sacrifices and put up your 
<A NAME="907"></A>requests unto the gods that you might see the report verified, now, when 
<A NAME="908"></A>the general is returned with an undoubted conquest, to defraud the gods 
<A NAME="909"></A>of honour, and yourselves of joy, as if you feared to behold the greatness 
<A NAME="910"></A>of his warlike deed, or were resolved to spare your enemy? And of the two, 
<A NAME="911"></A>much better were it to put a stop to the triumph, out of pity to him, than 
<A NAME="912"></A>out of envy to your general; yet to such a height of power is malice arrived 
<A NAME="913"></A>amongst you, that a man without one scar to show on his skin, that is smooth 
<A NAME="914"></A>and sleek with ease and homekeeping habits, will undertake to define the 
<A NAME="915"></A>office and duties of a general before us, who with our own wounds have 
<A NAME="916"></A>been taught how to judge of the valour or the cowardice of commanders." 
<A NAME="917"></A>And, at the same time, putting aside his garment, he showed an infinite 
<A NAME="918"></A>number of scars upon his breast, and, turning about, he exposed some parts 
<A NAME="919"></A>of his person which it is usual to conceal; and, addressing Galba, said: 
<A NAME="920"></A>"You deride me for these, in which I glory before my fellow-citizens, for 
<A NAME="921"></A>it is in their service, in which I have ridden night and day, that I received 
<A NAME="922"></A>them; but go collect the votes, whilst I follow after, and note the base 
<A NAME="923"></A>and ungrateful, and such as choose rather to be flattered and courted than 
<A NAME="924"></A>commanded by their general." It is said this speech so stopped the soldiers' 
<A NAME="925"></A>mouths, and altered their minds, that all the tribes decreed a triumph 
<A NAME="926"></A>for Aemilius; which was performed after this manner.
<A NAME="927"></A><BR><BR>The people erected scaffolds in the forum, in the circuses, as 
<A NAME="928"></A>they call their buildings for horse-races, and in all other parts of the 
<A NAME="929"></A>city where they could best behold the show. The spectators were clad in 
<A NAME="930"></A>white garments; all the temples were open, and full of garlands and perfumes; 
<A NAME="931"></A>the ways were cleared and kept open by numerous officers, who drove back 
<A NAME="932"></A>all who crowded into or ran across the main avenue. This triumph lasted 
<A NAME="933"></A>three days. On the first, which was scarcely long enough for the sight, 
<A NAME="934"></A>were to be seen the statues, pictures, and colossal images which were taken 
<A NAME="935"></A>from the enemy, drawn upon two hundred and fifty chariots. On the second 
<A NAME="936"></A>was carried in a great many wagons the finest and richest armour of the 
<A NAME="937"></A>Macedonians, both of brass and steel, all newly polished and glittering 
<A NAME="938"></A>the pieces of which were piled up and arranged purposely with the greatest 
<A NAME="939"></A>art, so as to seem to be tumbled in heaps carelessly and by chance: helmets 
<A NAME="940"></A>were thrown upon shields, coats of mail upon greaves; Cretan targets, and 
<A NAME="941"></A>Thracian bucklers and quivers of arrows, lay huddled amongst horses' bits, 
<A NAME="942"></A>and through these there appeared the points of naked swords, intermixed 
<A NAME="943"></A>with long Macedonian sarissas. All these arms were fastened together with 
<A NAME="944"></A>just so much looseness that they struck against one another as they were 
<A NAME="945"></A>drawn along, and made a harsh and alarming noise, so that, even as spoils 
<A NAME="946"></A>of a conquered enemy, they could not be beheld without dread. After these 
<A NAME="947"></A>wagons loaded with armour there followed three thousand men who carried 
<A NAME="948"></A>the silver that was coined, in seven hundred and fifty vessels, each of 
<A NAME="949"></A>which weighed three talents, and was carried by four men. Others brought 
<A NAME="950"></A>silver bowls and goblets and cups, all disposed in such order as to make 
<A NAME="951"></A>the best show, and all curious as well for their size as the solidity of 
<A NAME="952"></A>their embossed work.
<A NAME="953"></A><BR><BR>On the third day, early in the morning, first came the trumpeters, 
<A NAME="954"></A>who did not sound as they were wont in a procession or solemn entry, but 
<A NAME="955"></A>such a charge as the Romans use when they encourage the soldiers to fight. 
<A NAME="956"></A>Next followed young men wearing frocks with ornamented borders, who led 
<A NAME="957"></A>to the sacrifice a hundred and twenty stalled oxen, with their horns gilded, 
<A NAME="958"></A>and their heads adorned with ribbons and garlands; and with these were 
<A NAME="959"></A>boys that carried basins for libation, of silver and gold. After this was 
<A NAME="960"></A>brought the gold coin, which was divided into vessels that weighed three 
<A NAME="961"></A>talents, like those that contained the silver; they were in number seventy-seven. 
<A NAME="962"></A>These were followed by those that brought the consecrated bowl which Aemilius 
<A NAME="963"></A>had caused to be made, that weighed ten talents, and was set with precious 
<A NAME="964"></A>stones. Then were exposed to view the cups of Antigonus and Seleucus, and 
<A NAME="965"></A>those of the Thericlean make, and all the gold plate that was used at Perseus's 
<A NAME="966"></A>table. Next to these came Perseus's chariot, in which his armour was placed, 
<A NAME="967"></A>and on that his diadem. And, after a little intermission, the king's children 
<A NAME="968"></A>were led captives, and with them a train of their attendants, masters, 
<A NAME="969"></A>and teachers, all shedding tears, and stretching out hands to the spectators, 
<A NAME="970"></A>and making the children themselves also beg and entreat their compassion. 
<A NAME="971"></A>There were two sons and a daughter, whose tender age made them but little 
<A NAME="972"></A>sensible of the greatness of their misery, which very insensibility of 
<A NAME="973"></A>their condition rendered it the more deplorable; insomuch that Perseus 
<A NAME="974"></A>himself was scarcely regarded as he went along, whilst pity fixed the eyes 
<A NAME="975"></A>of the Romans upon the infants; and many of them could not forbear tears, 
<A NAME="976"></A>and all beheld the sight with a mixture of sorrow and pleasure, until the 
<A NAME="977"></A>children were passed.
<A NAME="978"></A><BR><BR>After his children and their attendants came Perseus himself, clad 
<A NAME="979"></A>all in black, and wearing the boots of his country, and looking like one 
<A NAME="980"></A>altogether stunned and deprived of reason, through the greatness of his 
<A NAME="981"></A>misfortunes. Next followed a great company of his friends and familiars, 
<A NAME="982"></A>whose countenances were disfigured with grief, and who let the spectators 
<A NAME="983"></A>see, by their tears and their continual looking upon Perseus, that it was 
<A NAME="984"></A>his fortune they so much lamented, and that they were regardless of their 
<A NAME="985"></A>own. Perseus sent to Aemilius to entreat that he might not be led in pomp, 
<A NAME="986"></A>but be left out of the triumph; who, deriding, as was but just, his cowardice 
<A NAME="987"></A>and fondness of life, sent him this answer, that as for that, it had been 
<A NAME="988"></A>before, and was now, in his own power; giving him to understand that the 
<A NAME="989"></A>disgrace could be avoided by death; which the faint-hearted man not having 
<A NAME="990"></A>the spirit for, and made effeminate by I know not what hopes, allowed himself 
<A NAME="991"></A>to appear as a part of his own spoils. After these were carried four hundred 
<A NAME="992"></A>crowns, all made of gold, sent from the cities by their respective deputations 
<A NAME="993"></A>to Aemilius, in honour of his victory. Then he himself came, seated on 
<A NAME="994"></A>a chariot magnificently adorned (a man well worthy to be looked at, even 
<A NAME="995"></A>without these ensigns of power), dressed in a robe of purple, interwoven 
<A NAME="996"></A>with gold, and holding a laurel branch in his right hand. All the army, 
<A NAME="997"></A>in like manner, with boughs of laurel in their hands, divided into their 
<A NAME="998"></A>hands and companies, followed the chariot of their commander; some singing 
<A NAME="999"></A>verses, according to the usual custom, mingled with raillery; others, songs 
<A NAME="1000"></A>of triumph and the praise of Aemilius's deeds; who, indeed, was admired 
<A NAME="1001"></A>and accounted happy by all men, and unenvied by every one that was good; 
<A NAME="1002"></A>except so far as it seems the province of some god to lessen that happiness 
<A NAME="1003"></A>which is too great and inordinate, and so to mingle the affairs of human 
<A NAME="1004"></A>life that no one should be entirely free and exempt from calamities; but, 
<A NAME="1005"></A>as we read in Homer, that those should think themselves truly blessed whom 
<A NAME="1006"></A>fortune has given an equal share of good and evil.
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR><BR>Aemilius had four sons, of whom Scipio and Fabius, as is already 
<A NAME="1008"></A>related, were adopted into other families; the other two, whom he had by 
<A NAME="1009"></A>a second wife, and who were yet but young, he brought up in his own house. 
<A NAME="1010"></A>One of these died at fourteen years of age, five days before his father's 
<A NAME="1011"></A>triumph, the other at twelve, three days after; so that there was no Roman 
<A NAME="1012"></A>without a deep sense of his suffering, and who did not shudder at the cruelty 
<A NAME="1013"></A>of fortune, that had not scrupled to bring so much sorrow into a house 
<A NAME="1014"></A>replenished with happiness, rejoicing, and sacrifices, and to intermingle 
<A NAME="1015"></A>tears and laments with songs of victory and triumph.
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR><BR>Aemilius, however, reasoning justly that courage and resolution 
<A NAME="1017"></A>was not merely to resist armour and spears, but all the shocks of ill-fortune, 
<A NAME="1018"></A>so met and so adapted himself to these mingled and contrasting circumstances, 
<A NAME="1019"></A>as to outbalance the evil with the good, and his private concerns with 
<A NAME="1020"></A>those of the public; and thus did not allow anything either to take away 
<A NAME="1021"></A>from the grandeur, or sully the dignity of his victory. For as soon as 
<A NAME="1022"></A>he had buried the first of his sons (as we have already said), he triumphed; 
<A NAME="1023"></A>and the second dying almost as soon as his triumph was over, he gathered 
<A NAME="1024"></A>together an assembly of the people, and made an oration to them, not like 
<A NAME="1025"></A>a man that stood in need of comfort from others, but one that undertook 
<A NAME="1026"></A>to support his fellow-citizens in their grief for the sufferings he himself 
<A NAME="1027"></A>underwent.
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR><BR>"I," he said, "who never yet feared anything that was human, have, 
<A NAME="1029"></A>amongst such as were divine, always had a dread of Fortune as faithless 
<A NAME="1030"></A>and inconstant; and, for the very reason that in this war she had been 
<A NAME="1031"></A>as a favourable gale in all my affairs, I still expected some change and 
<A NAME="1032"></A>reflux of things. In one day I passed the Ionian sea, and reached Corcyra 
<A NAME="1033"></A>from Brundisium; thence in five more I sacrificed at Delphi, and in other 
<A NAME="1034"></A>five days came to my forces in Macedonia, where, after I had finished the 
<A NAME="1035"></A>usual sacrifices for the purifying of the army, I entered on my duties, 
<A NAME="1036"></A>and, in space of fifteen days, put an honourable period to the war. Still 
<A NAME="1037"></A>retaining a jealousy of Fortune, even from the smooth current of my affairs, 
<A NAME="1038"></A>and seeing myself secure and free from the danger of any enemy, I chiefly 
<A NAME="1039"></A>dreaded the change of the goddess at sea, whilst conveying home my victorious 
<A NAME="1040"></A>army, vast spoils, and a captive king. Nay, indeed, after I was returned 
<A NAME="1041"></A>to you safe, and saw the city full of joy, congratulating, and sacrifices, 
<A NAME="1042"></A>yet still I distrusted, well knowing that Fortune never conferred any great 
<A NAME="1043"></A>benefits that were unmixed and unattended with probabilities of reverse. 
<A NAME="1044"></A>Nor could my mind, that was still as it were in labour, and always foreseeing 
<A NAME="1045"></A>something to befall this city, free itself from this fear, until this great 
<A NAME="1046"></A>misfortune befell me in my own family, and till, in the midst of those 
<A NAME="1047"></A>days set apart for triumph, I carried two of the best sons, my only destined 
<A NAME="1048"></A>successors, one after another to their funerals. Now, therefore, I am myself 
<A NAME="1049"></A>safe from danger, at least as to what was my greatest care; and I trust 
<A NAME="1050"></A>and am verily persuaded that for the time to come Fortune will prove constant 
<A NAME="1051"></A>and harmless unto you; since she has sufficiently wreaked her jealousy 
<A NAME="1052"></A>at our great success on me and mine, and has made the conqueror as marked 
<A NAME="1053"></A>an example of human instability as the captive whom he led in triumph, 
<A NAME="1054"></A>with this only difference, that Perseus, though conquered, does yet enjoy 
<A NAME="1055"></A>his children, while the conqueror, Aemilius, is deprived of his." This 
<A NAME="1056"></A>was the generous and magnanimous oration Aemilius is said to have spoken 
<A NAME="1057"></A>to the people, from a heart truly sincere and free from all 
<A NAME="1058"></A>artifice.
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR><BR>Although he very much pitied the condition of Perseus, and studied 
<A NAME="1060"></A>to befriend him in what he was able, yet he could procure no other favour 
<A NAME="1061"></A>than his removal from the common prison, the Carcer, into a more cleanly 
<A NAME="1062"></A>and humane place of security, where, whilst he was guarded, it is said, 
<A NAME="1063"></A>he starved himself to death. Others state his death to be of the strangest 
<A NAME="1064"></A>and most unusual character: that the soldiers who were his guard, having 
<A NAME="1065"></A>conceived a spite and hatred against him for some reason, and finding no 
<A NAME="1066"></A>other way to grieve and afflict him, kept him from sleep, took pains to 
<A NAME="1067"></A>disturb him when he was disposed to rest, and found out contrivances to 
<A NAME="1068"></A>keep him continually awake, by which means at length he was utterly worn 
<A NAME="1069"></A>out, and expired. Two of his children, also, died soon after him; the third, 
<A NAME="1070"></A>who was named Alexander, they say proved an exquisite artist in turning 
<A NAME="1071"></A>and graving small figures, and learned so perfectly to speak and write 
<A NAME="1072"></A>the Roman language, that he became clerk to the magistrates, and behaved 
<A NAME="1073"></A>himself in his office with great skill and conduct.
<A NAME="1074"></A><BR><BR>They ascribed to Aemilius's conquest of Macedonia this most acceptable 
<A NAME="1075"></A>benefit to the people, that he brought so vast a quantity of money into 
<A NAME="1076"></A>the public treasury, that they never paid any taxes, until Hirtius and 
<A NAME="1077"></A>Pansa were consuls, which was in the first war between Antony and Caesar. 
<A NAME="1078"></A>This also was peculiar and remarkable in Aemilius, that though he was extremely 
<A NAME="1079"></A>beloved and honoured by the people, yet he always sided with the nobles; 
<A NAME="1080"></A>nor would he either say or do anything to ingratiate himself with the multitude, 
<A NAME="1081"></A>but constantly adhered to the nobility, in all political matters, which 
<A NAME="1082"></A>in aftertimes was cast i
