<A NAME="2"></A>
<BR>(legendary, died 322 B.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Whoever it was, Sosius, that wrote the poem in honour of Alcibiades, upon 
<A NAME="11"></A>his winning the chariot-race at the Olympian Games, whether it were Euripides, 
<A NAME="12"></A>as is most commonly thought, or some other person, he tells us that to 
<A NAME="13"></A>a man's being happy it is in the first place requisite he should be born 
<A NAME="14"></A>in "some famous city." But for him that would attain to true happiness, 
<A NAME="15"></A>which for the most part is placed in the qualities and disposition of the 
<A NAME="16"></A>mind, it is, in my opinion, of no other disadvantage to be of a mean, obscure 
<A NAME="17"></A>country, than to be born of a small or plain-looking woman. For it were 
<A NAME="18"></A>ridiculous to think that Iulis, a little part of Ceos, which itself is 
<A NAME="19"></A>no great island, and Aegina, which an Athenian once said ought to be removed, 
<A NAME="20"></A>like a small eyesore, from the port of Piraeus should breed good actors 
<A NAME="21"></A>and poets, and yet should never be able to produce a just, temperate, wise, 
<A NAME="22"></A>and high-minded man. Other arts, whose end it is to acquire riches or honour, 
<A NAME="23"></A>are likely enough to wither and decay in poor and undistinguished towns; 
<A NAME="24"></A>but virtue, like a strong and durable plant, may take root and thrive in 
<A NAME="25"></A>any place where it can lay hold of an ingenuous nature, and a mind that 
<A NAME="26"></A>is industrious. I, for my part, shall desire that for any deficiency of 
<A NAME="27"></A>mine in right judgment or action, I myself may be, as in fairness, held 
<A NAME="28"></A>accountable, and shall not attribute it to the obscurity of my 
<A NAME="29"></A>birthplace.
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>But if any man undertake to write a history that has to be collected 
<A NAME="31"></A>from materials gathered by observation and the reading of works not easy 
<A NAME="32"></A>to be got in all places, nor written always in his own language, but many 
<A NAME="33"></A>of them foreign and dispersed in other hands, for him, undoubtedly, it 
<A NAME="34"></A>is in the first place and above all things most necessary to reside in 
<A NAME="35"></A>some city of good note, addicted to liberal arts, and populous; where he 
<A NAME="36"></A>may have plenty of all sorts of books, and upon inquiry may hear and inform 
<A NAME="37"></A>himself of such particulars as, having escaped the pens of writers, are 
<A NAME="38"></A>more faithfully preserved in the memories of men, lest his work be deficient 
<A NAME="39"></A>in many things, even those which it can least dispense 
<A NAME="40"></A>with.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR><BR>But for me, I live in a little town, where I am willing to continue, 
<A NAME="42"></A>lest it should grow less; and having had no leisure, while I was in Rome 
<A NAME="43"></A>and other parts of Italy, to exercise myself in the Roman language, on 
<A NAME="44"></A>account of public business and of those who came to be instructed by me 
<A NAME="45"></A>in philosophy, it was very late, and in the decline of my age, before I 
<A NAME="46"></A>applied myself to the reading of Latin authors. Upon which that which happened 
<A NAME="47"></A>to me may seem strange, though it be true; for it was not so much by the 
<A NAME="48"></A>knowledge of words that I came to the understanding of things, as by my 
<A NAME="49"></A>experience of things I was enabled to follow the meaning of words. But 
<A NAME="50"></A>to appreciate the graceful and ready pronunciation of the Roman tongue, 
<A NAME="51"></A>to understand the various figures and connection of words, and such other 
<A NAME="52"></A>ornaments, in which the beauty of speaking consists, is, I doubt not, an 
<A NAME="53"></A>admirable and delightful accomplishment; but it requires a degree of practice 
<A NAME="54"></A>and study which is not easy, and will better suit those who have more leisure, 
<A NAME="55"></A>and time enough yet before them for the occupation.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR>And so in this fifth book of my Parallel Lives, in giving an account 
<A NAME="57"></A>of Demosthenes and Cicero, my comparison of their natural dispositions 
<A NAME="58"></A>and their characters will be formed upon their actions and their lives 
<A NAME="59"></A>as statesmen, and I shall not pretend to criticize their orations one against 
<A NAME="60"></A>the other, to show which of the two was the more charming or the more powerful 
<A NAME="61"></A>speaker. For there, as Ion says-
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR>"We are but like a fish upon dry land;" a proverb which Caecilius 
<A NAME="63"></A>perhaps forgot, when he employed his always adventurous talents in so ambitious 
<A NAME="64"></A>an attempt as a comparison of Demosthenes and Cicero; and, possibly, if 
<A NAME="65"></A>it were a thing obvious and easy for every man to know himself, the precept 
<A NAME="66"></A>had not passed for an oracle.
<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR>The divine power seems originally to have designed Demosthenes 
<A NAME="68"></A>and Cicero upon the same plan, giving them many similarities in their natural 
<A NAME="69"></A>characters, as their passion for distinction and their love of liberty 
<A NAME="70"></A>in civil life, and their want of courage in dangers and war, and at the 
<A NAME="71"></A>same time also to have added many accidental resemblances. I think there 
<A NAME="72"></A>can hardly be found two other orators, who, from small and obscure beginnings, 
<A NAME="73"></A>became so great and mighty; who both contested with kings and tyrants; 
<A NAME="74"></A>both lost their daughters, were driven out of their country, and returned 
<A NAME="75"></A>with honour; who, flying from thence again, were both seized upon by their 
<A NAME="76"></A>enemies, and at last ended their lives with the liberty of their countrymen. 
<A NAME="77"></A>So that if we were to suppose there had been a trial of skill between nature 
<A NAME="78"></A>and fortune, as there is sometimes between artists, it would be hard to 
<A NAME="79"></A>judge whether that succeeded best in making them alike in their dispositions 
<A NAME="80"></A>and manners, or this in the coincidences of their lives. We will speak 
<A NAME="81"></A>of the eldest first.
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR>Demosthenes, the father of Demosthenes, was a citizen of good rank 
<A NAME="83"></A>and quality, as Theopompus informs us, surnamed the Sword-maker, because 
<A NAME="84"></A>he had a large workhouse, and kept servants skilful in that art at work. 
<A NAME="85"></A>But of that which Aeschines the orator said of his mother, that she was 
<A NAME="86"></A>descended of one Gylon, who fled his country upon an accusation of treason, 
<A NAME="87"></A>and of a barbarian woman, I can affirm nothing, whether he spoke true, 
<A NAME="88"></A>or slandered and maligned her. This is certain, that Demosthenes, being 
<A NAME="89"></A>as yet but seven years old was left by his father in affluent circumstances, 
<A NAME="90"></A>the whole value of his estate being little short of fifteen talents, and 
<A NAME="91"></A>that he was wronged by his guardians, part of his fortune being embezzled 
<A NAME="92"></A>by them, and the rest neglected; insomuch that even his teachers were defrauded 
<A NAME="93"></A>of their salaries. This was the reason that he did not obtain the liberal 
<A NAME="94"></A>education that he should have had; besides that, on account of weakness 
<A NAME="95"></A>and delicate health, his mother would not let him exert himself, and his 
<A NAME="96"></A>teachers forbore to urge him. He was meagre and sickly from the first, 
<A NAME="97"></A>and hence had his nickname of Batalus given him, it is said, by the boys, 
<A NAME="98"></A>in derision of his appearance; Batalus being, as some tell us, a certain 
<A NAME="99"></A>enervated flute-player, in ridicule of whom Antiphanes wrote a play. Others 
<A NAME="100"></A>speak of Batalus as a writer of wanton verses and drinking songs. And it 
<A NAME="101"></A>would seem that some part of the body, not decent to be named, was at that 
<A NAME="102"></A>time called batalus by the Athenians. But the name of Argas, which also 
<A NAME="103"></A>they say was a nickname of Demosthenes, was given him for his behaviour, 
<A NAME="104"></A>as being savage and spiteful, argas being one of the poetical words for 
<A NAME="105"></A>a snake; or for his disagreeable way of speaking, Argas being the name 
<A NAME="106"></A>of a poet who composed very harshly and disagreeably. So much, as Plato 
<A NAME="107"></A>says, for such matters.
<A NAME="108"></A><BR><BR>The first occasion of his eager inclination to oratory, they say, 
<A NAME="109"></A>was this. Callistratus, the orator, being to plead in open court for Oropus, 
<A NAME="110"></A>the expectation of the issue of that cause was very great, as well for 
<A NAME="111"></A>the ability of the orator, who was then at the height of his reputation, 
<A NAME="112"></A>as also for the fame of the action itself. Therefore, Demosthenes, having 
<A NAME="113"></A>heard the tutors and school-masters agreeing among themselves to be present 
<A NAME="114"></A>at this trial, with much importunity persuades his tutor to take him along 
<A NAME="115"></A>with him to the hearing; who, having some acquaintance with the doorkeepers, 
<A NAME="116"></A>procured a place where the boy might sit unseen, and hear what was said. 
<A NAME="117"></A>Callistratus having got the day, and being much admired, the boy began 
<A NAME="118"></A>to look upon his glory with a kind of emulation, observing how he was courted 
<A NAME="119"></A>on all hands, and attended on his way by the multitude; but his wonder 
<A NAME="120"></A>was more than all excited by the power of his eloquence, which seemed able 
<A NAME="121"></A>to subdue and win over anything. From this time, therefore, bidding farewell 
<A NAME="122"></A>to other sorts of learning and study, he now began to exercise himself, 
<A NAME="123"></A>and to take pains in declaiming, as one that meant to be himself also an 
<A NAME="124"></A>orator. He made use of Isaeus as his guide to the art of speaking, though 
<A NAME="125"></A>Isocrates at that time was giving lessons; whether, as some say, because 
<A NAME="126"></A>he was an orphan, and was not able to pay Isocrates his appointed fee of 
<A NAME="127"></A>ten minae or because he preferred Isaeus's speaking, as being more businesslike 
<A NAME="128"></A>and effective in actual use. Hermippus says that he met with certain memoirs 
<A NAME="129"></A>without any author's name, in which it was written that Demosthenes was 
<A NAME="130"></A>a scholar to Plato, and learnt much of his eloquence from him; and he also 
<A NAME="131"></A>mentions Ctesibius, as reporting from Callias of Syracuse and some others, 
<A NAME="132"></A>that Demosthenes secretly obtained a knowledge of the systems of Isocrates 
<A NAME="133"></A>and Alcidamas, and mastered them thoroughly.
<A NAME="134"></A><BR><BR>As soon, therefore, as he was grown up to man's estate, he began 
<A NAME="135"></A>to go to law with his guardians, and to write orations against them; who, 
<A NAME="136"></A>in the meantime, had recourse to various subterfuges and pleas for new 
<A NAME="137"></A>trials, and Demosthenes, though he was thus, as Thucydides says, taught 
<A NAME="138"></A>his business in dangers, and by his own exertions was successful in his 
<A NAME="139"></A>suit, was yet unable for all this to recover so much as a small fraction 
<A NAME="140"></A>of his patrimony. He only attained some degree of confidence in speaking, 
<A NAME="141"></A>and some competent experience in it. And having got a taste of the honour 
<A NAME="142"></A>and power which are acquired by pleadings, he now ventured to come forth, 
<A NAME="143"></A>and to undertake public business. And, as it is said of Laomedon, the Orchomenian, 
<A NAME="144"></A>that, by advice of his physician, he used to run long distances to keep 
<A NAME="145"></A>off some disease of his spleen, and by that means having, through labour 
<A NAME="146"></A>and exercise, framed the habit of his body, he betook himself to the great 
<A NAME="147"></A>garland games, and became one of the best runners at the long race; so 
<A NAME="148"></A>it happened to Demosthenes, who, first venturing upon oratory for the recovery 
<A NAME="149"></A>of his own private property, by this acquired ability in speaking, and 
<A NAME="150"></A>at length, in public business, as it were in the great games, came to have 
<A NAME="151"></A>the pre-eminence of all competitors in the assembly. But when he first 
<A NAME="152"></A>addressed himself to the people, he met with great discouragements, and 
<A NAME="153"></A>was derided for his strange and uncouth style, which was cumbered with 
<A NAME="154"></A>long sentences and tortured with formal arguments to a most harsh and disagreeable 
<A NAME="155"></A>excess. Besides, he had, it seems, a weakness in his voice, a perplexed 
<A NAME="156"></A>and indistinct utterance and a shortness of breath, which, by breaking 
<A NAME="157"></A>and disjointing his sentences, much obscured the sense and meaning of what 
<A NAME="158"></A>he spoke. So that in the end being quite disheartened, he forsook the assembly; 
<A NAME="159"></A>and as he was walking carelessly and sauntering about the Piraeus, Eunomus, 
<A NAME="160"></A>the Thriasian, then a very old man, seeing him, upbraided him, saying that 
<A NAME="161"></A>his diction was very much like that of Pericles, and that he was wanting 
<A NAME="162"></A>to himself through cowardice and meanness of spirit, neither bearing up 
<A NAME="163"></A>with courage against popular outcry, nor fitting his body for action, but 
<A NAME="164"></A>suffering it to languish through mere sloth and negligence.
<A NAME="165"></A><BR><BR>Another time, when the assembly had refused to hear him, and he 
<A NAME="166"></A>was going home with his head muffled up, taking it very heavily, they relate 
<A NAME="167"></A>that Satyrus, the actor, followed him, and being his familiar acquaintance, 
<A NAME="168"></A>entered into conversation with him. To whom, when Demosthenes bemoaned 
<A NAME="169"></A>himself, that having been the most industrious of all the pleaders, and 
<A NAME="170"></A>having almost spent the whole strength and vigour of his body in that employment, 
<A NAME="171"></A>he could not yet find any acceptance with the people, that drunken sots, 
<A NAME="172"></A>mariners, and illiterate fellows were heard, and had the husting's for 
<A NAME="173"></A>their own, while he himself was despised, "You say true, Demosthenes," 
<A NAME="174"></A>replied Satyrus, "but I will quickly remedy the cause of all this, if you 
<A NAME="175"></A>will repeat to me some passage out of Euripides or Sophocles." Which when 
<A NAME="176"></A>Demosthenes had pronounced, Satyrus presently taking it up after him, gave 
<A NAME="177"></A>the same passage, in his rendering of it, such a new form, by accompanying 
<A NAME="178"></A>it with the proper mien and gesture, that to Demosthenes it seemed quite 
<A NAME="179"></A>another thing. By this, being convinced how much grace and ornament language 
<A NAME="180"></A>acquires from action, he began to esteem it a small matter, and as good 
<A NAME="181"></A>as nothing for a man to exercise himself in declaiming, if he neglected 
<A NAME="182"></A>enunciation and delivery. Hereupon he built himself a place to study in 
<A NAME="183"></A>under ground (which was still remaining in our time), and hither he would 
<A NAME="184"></A>come constantly every day to form his action and to exercise his voice; 
<A NAME="185"></A>and here he would continue, oftentimes without intermission, two or three 
<A NAME="186"></A>months together, shaving one half of his head, that so for shame he might 
<A NAME="187"></A>not go abroad, though he desired it ever so much.
<A NAME="188"></A><BR><BR>Nor was this all, but he also made his conversation with people 
<A NAME="189"></A>abroad, his common speech, and his business, subservient to his studies, 
<A NAME="190"></A>taking from hence occasions and arguments as matter to work upon. For as 
<A NAME="191"></A>soon as he was parted from his company, down he would go at once into his 
<A NAME="192"></A>study, and run over everything in order that had passed, and the reasons 
<A NAME="193"></A>that might be alleged for and against it. Any speeches, also, that he was 
<A NAME="194"></A>present at, he would go over again with himself, and reduce into periods; 
<A NAME="195"></A>and whatever others spoke to him, or he to them, he would correct, transform, 
<A NAME="196"></A>and vary several ways. Hence it was that he was looked upon as a person 
<A NAME="197"></A>of no great natural genius, but one who owed all the power and ability 
<A NAME="198"></A>he had in speaking to labour and industry. Of the truth of which it was 
<A NAME="199"></A>thought to be no small sign that he was very rarely heard to speak upon 
<A NAME="200"></A>the occasion, but though he were by name frequently called upon by the 
<A NAME="201"></A>people, as he sat in the assembly, yet he would not rise unless he had 
<A NAME="202"></A>previously considered the subject, and came prepared for it. So that many 
<A NAME="203"></A>of the popular pleaders used to make it a jest against him; and Pytheas 
<A NAME="204"></A>once, scoffing at him, said that his arguments smelt of the lamp. To which 
<A NAME="205"></A>Demosthenes gave the sharp answer, "It is true, indeed, Pytheas, that your 
<A NAME="206"></A>lamp and mine are not conscious of the same things." To others, however, 
<A NAME="207"></A>he would not much deny it, but would admit frankly enough, that he neither 
<A NAME="208"></A>entirely wrote his speeches beforehand, nor yet spoke wholly extempore. 
<A NAME="209"></A>And he would affirm that it was the more truly popular act to use premeditation, 
<A NAME="210"></A>such preparation being a kind of respect to the people; whereas, to slight 
<A NAME="211"></A>and take no care how what is said is likely to be received by the audience, 
<A NAME="212"></A>shows something of an oligarchical temper, and is the course of one that 
<A NAME="213"></A>intends force rather than persuasion. Of his want of courage and assurance 
<A NAME="214"></A>to speak offhand, they make it also another argument that, when he was 
<A NAME="215"></A>at a loss and discomposed, Demades would often rise up on the sudden to 
<A NAME="216"></A>support him, but he was never observed to do the same for 
<A NAME="217"></A>Demades.
<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR>Whence then, may some say, was it, that Aeschines speaks of him 
<A NAME="219"></A>as a person so much to be wondered at for his boldness in speaking? Or, 
<A NAME="220"></A>how could it be, when Python, the Byzantine, with so much confidence and 
<A NAME="221"></A>such a torrent of words inveighed against the Athenians, that Demosthenes 
<A NAME="222"></A>alone stood up to oppose him? Or when Lamarchus, the Myrinaean, had written 
<A NAME="223"></A>a panegyric upon King Philip and Alexander, in which he uttered many things 
<A NAME="224"></A>in reproach of the Thebans and Olynthians, and at the Olympic Games recited 
<A NAME="225"></A>it publicly, how was it that he, rising up, and recounting historically 
<A NAME="226"></A>and demonstratively what benefits and advantages all Greece had received 
<A NAME="227"></A>from the Thebans and Chalcidians, and, on the contrary, what mischiefs 
<A NAME="228"></A>the flatterers of the Macedonians had brought upon it, so turned the minds 
<A NAME="229"></A>of all that were present that the sophist, in alarm at the outcry against 
<A NAME="230"></A>him, secretly made his way out of the assembly? But Demosthenes, it should 
<A NAME="231"></A>seem, regarded other points in the character of Pericles to be unsuited 
<A NAME="232"></A>to him; but his reserve and his sustained manner, and his forbearing to 
<A NAME="233"></A>speak on the sudden, or upon every occasion, as being the things to which 
<A NAME="234"></A>principally he owed his greatness, these he followed, and endeavoured to 
<A NAME="235"></A>imitate, neither wholly neglecting the glory which present occasion offered, 
<A NAME="236"></A>nor yet willing too often to expose his faculty to the mercy of chance. 
<A NAME="237"></A>For, in fact, the orations which were spoken by him had much more of boldness 
<A NAME="238"></A>and confidence in them than those that he wrote, if we may believe Eratosthenes, 
<A NAME="239"></A>Demetrius the Phalerian, and the Comedians. Eratosthenes says that often 
<A NAME="240"></A>in his speaking he would be transported into a kind of ecstasy, and Demetrius, 
<A NAME="241"></A>that he uttered the famous metrical adjuration to the 
<A NAME="242"></A>people-
<A NAME="243"></A><BR><BR>"By the earth, the springs, the rivers, and the streams," as a 
<A NAME="244"></A>man inspired and beside himself. One of the comedians calls him a rhopoperperethras, 
<A NAME="245"></A>and another scoffs at him for his use of antithesis:-
<A NAME="246"></A><BR><BR>"And what he took, took back; a phrase to please,
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>The very fancy of Demosthenes." Unless, indeed, this also is meant 
<A NAME="248"></A>by Antiphanes for a jest upon the speech on Halonesus, which Demosthenes 
<A NAME="249"></A>advised the Athenians not to take at Philip's hands, but to take 
<A NAME="250"></A>back.
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR>All, however, used to consider Demades, in the mere use of his 
<A NAME="252"></A>natural gifts, an orator impossible to surpass, and that in what he spoke 
<A NAME="253"></A>on the sudden, he excelled all the study and preparation of Demosthenes. 
<A NAME="254"></A>And Ariston, the Chian, has recorded a judgment which Theophrastus passed 
<A NAME="255"></A>upon the orators; for being asked what kind of orator he accounted Demosthenes, 
<A NAME="256"></A>he answered, "Worthy of the city of Athens;" and then what he thought of 
<A NAME="257"></A>Demades, he answered, "Above it." And the same philosopher reports that 
<A NAME="258"></A>Polyeuctus, the Sphettian, one of the Athenian politicians about that time, 
<A NAME="259"></A>was wont to say that Demosthenes was the greatest orator, but Phocion the 
<A NAME="260"></A>ablest; as he expressed the most sense in the fewest words. And, indeed, 
<A NAME="261"></A>it is related that Demosthenes himself, as often as Phocion stood up to 
<A NAME="262"></A>plead against him, would say to his acquaintance, "Here comes the knife 
<A NAME="263"></A>to my speech." Yet it does not appear whether he had this feeling for his 
<A NAME="264"></A>powers of speaking, or for his life and character, and meant to say that 
<A NAME="265"></A>one word or nod from a man who was really trusted would go further than 
<A NAME="266"></A>a thousand lengthy periods from others.
<A NAME="267"></A><BR><BR>Demetrius, the Phalerian, tells us that he was informed by Demosthenes 
<A NAME="268"></A>himself, now grown old, that the ways he made use of to remedy his natural 
<A NAME="269"></A>bodily infirmities and defects were such as these; his inarticulate and 
<A NAME="270"></A>stammering pronunciation he overcame and rendered more distinct by speaking 
<A NAME="271"></A>with pebbles in his mouth; his voice he disciplined by declaiming and reciting 
<A NAME="272"></A>speeches or verses when he was out of breath, while running or going up 
<A NAME="273"></A>steep places; and that in his house he had a large looking-glass, before 
<A NAME="274"></A>which he would stand and go through his exercises. It is told that some 
<A NAME="275"></A>one once came to request his assistance as a pleader, and related how he 
<A NAME="276"></A>had been assaulted and beaten. "Certainly," said Demosthenes, "nothing 
<A NAME="277"></A>of the kind can have happened to you." Upon which the other, raising his 
<A NAME="278"></A>voice, exclaimed loudly, "What, Demosthenes, nothing has been done to me?" 
<A NAME="279"></A>"Ah," replied Demosthenes, "now I hear the voice of one that has been injured 
<A NAME="280"></A>and beaten." Of so great consequence towards the gaining of belief did 
<A NAME="281"></A>he esteem the tone and action of the speaker. The action which he used 
<A NAME="282"></A>himself was wonderfully pleasing to the common people, but by well-educated 
<A NAME="283"></A>people, as, for example, by Demetrius, the Phalerian, it was looked upon 
<A NAME="284"></A>as mean, humiliating, and unmanly. And Hermippus says of Aesion, that, 
<A NAME="285"></A>being asked his opinion concerning the ancient orators, and those of his 
<A NAME="286"></A>own time, he answered that it was admirable to see with what composure 
<A NAME="287"></A>and in what high style they addressed themselves to the people; but that 
<A NAME="288"></A>the orations of Demosthenes, when they are read, certainly appear to be 
<A NAME="289"></A>superior in point of construction, and more effective. His written speeches, 
<A NAME="290"></A>beyond all question, are characterized by austere tone and by their severity. 
<A NAME="291"></A>In his extempore retorts and rejoinders, he allowed himself the use of 
<A NAME="292"></A>jest and mockery. When Demades said, "Demosthenes teach me! So might the 
<A NAME="293"></A>sow teach Minerva!" he replied, "Was it this Minerva, that was lately found 
<A NAME="294"></A>playing the harlot in Collytus?" When a thief, who had the nickname of 
<A NAME="295"></A>the Brazen, was attempting to upbraid him for sitting up late, and writing 
<A NAME="296"></A>by candle-light, "I know very well," said he, "that you had rather have 
<A NAME="297"></A>all lights out; and wonder not, O ye men of Athens, at the many robberies 
<A NAME="298"></A>which are committed, since we have thieves of brass and walls of clay." 
<A NAME="299"></A>But on these points, though we have much more to mention, we will add nothing 
<A NAME="300"></A>at present. We will proceed to take an estimate of his character from his 
<A NAME="301"></A>actions and his life as a statesmen.
<A NAME="302"></A><BR><BR>His first entering into public business was much about the time 
<A NAME="303"></A>of the Phocian war, as himself affirms, and may be collected from his Philippic 
<A NAME="304"></A>orations. For of these, some were made after that action was over, and 
<A NAME="305"></A>the earliest of them refer to its concluding events. It is certain that 
<A NAME="306"></A>he engaged in the accusation of Midias when he was but two-and-thirty years 
<A NAME="307"></A>old, having as yet no interest or reputation as a politician. And this 
<A NAME="308"></A>it was, I consider, that induced him to withdraw the action, and accept 
<A NAME="309"></A>a sum of money as a compromise. For of himself-
<A NAME="310"></A><BR><BR>"He was no easy or good-natured man," but of a determined disposition, 
<A NAME="311"></A>and resolute to see himself righted; however, finding it a hard matter 
<A NAME="312"></A>and above his strength to deal with Midias, a man so well secured on all 
<A NAME="313"></A>sides with money, eloquence, and friends, he yielded to the entreaties 
<A NAME="314"></A>of those who interceded for him. But had he seen any hopes or possibility 
<A NAME="315"></A>of prevailing, I cannot believe that three thousand drachmas could have 
<A NAME="316"></A>taken off the edge of his revenge. The object which he chose for himself 
<A NAME="317"></A>in the commonwealth was noble and just, the defence of the Grecians against 
<A NAME="318"></A>Philip; and in this he behaved himself so worthily that he soon grew famous, 
<A NAME="319"></A>and excited attention everywhere for his eloquence and courage in speaking. 
<A NAME="320"></A>He was admired through all Greece, the King of Persia courted him, and 
<A NAME="321"></A>by Philip himself he was more esteemed than all the other orators. His 
<A NAME="322"></A>very enemies were forced to confess that they had to do with a man of mark; 
<A NAME="323"></A>for such a character even Aeschines and Hyperides give him, where they 
<A NAME="324"></A>accuse and speak against him.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR>So that I cannot imagine what ground Theopompus had to say that 
<A NAME="326"></A>Demosthenes was of a fickle, unsettled disposition, and could not long 
<A NAME="327"></A>continue firm either to the same men or the same affairs; whereas the contrary 
<A NAME="328"></A>is most apparent, for the same party and post in politics which he held 
<A NAME="329"></A>from the beginning, to these he kept constant to the end; and was so far 
<A NAME="330"></A>from leaving them while he lived that he chose rather to forsake his life 
<A NAME="331"></A>than his purpose. He was never heard to apologize for shifting sides like 
<A NAME="332"></A>Demades, who would say he often spoke against himself, but never against 
<A NAME="333"></A>the city; nor as Melanopus, who being generally against Callistratus, but 
<A NAME="334"></A>being often bribed off with money, was wont to tell the people, "The man 
<A NAME="335"></A>indeed is my enemy, but we must submit for the good of our country;" nor 
<A NAME="336"></A>again as Nicodemus, the Messenian, who having first appeared on Cassander's 
<A NAME="337"></A>side, and afterwards taken part with Demetrius, said the two things were 
<A NAME="338"></A>not in themselves contrary, it being always most advisable to obey the 
<A NAME="339"></A>conqueror. We have nothing of this kind to say against Demosthenes, as 
<A NAME="340"></A>one who would turn aside or prevaricate, either in word or deed. There 
<A NAME="341"></A>could not have been less variation in his public acts if they had all been 
<A NAME="342"></A>played, so to say, from first to last, from the same score. Panaetius, 
<A NAME="343"></A>the philosopher, said that most of his orations are so written as if they 
<A NAME="344"></A>were to prove this one conclusion, that what is honest and virtuous is 
<A NAME="345"></A>for itself only to be chosen; as that of the Crown, that against Aristocrates, 
<A NAME="346"></A>that for the Immunities, and the Philippics; in all which he persuades 
<A NAME="347"></A>his fellow-citizens to pursue not that which seems most pleasant, easy, 
<A NAME="348"></A>or profitable; but declares, over and over again, that they ought in the 
<A NAME="349"></A>first place to prefer that which is just and honourable before their own 
<A NAME="350"></A>safety and preservation. So that if he had kept his hands clean, if his 
<A NAME="351"></A>courage for the wars had been answerable to the generosity of his principles, 
<A NAME="352"></A>and the dignity of his orations, he might deservedly have his name placed, 
<A NAME="353"></A>not in the number of such orators as Moerocles, Polyeuctus, and Hyperides, 
<A NAME="354"></A>but in the highest rank with Cimon, Thucydides, and 
<A NAME="355"></A>Pericles.
<A NAME="356"></A><BR><BR>Certainly amongst those who were contemporary with him, Phocion, 
<A NAME="357"></A>though he appeared on the less commendable side in the commonwealth, and 
<A NAME="358"></A>was counted as one of the Macedonian party, nevertheless, by his courage 
<A NAME="359"></A>and his honesty, procured himself a name not inferior to these of Ephialtes, 
<A NAME="360"></A>Aristides, and Cimon. But Demosthenes, being neither fit to be relied on 
<A NAME="361"></A>for courage in arms, as Demetrius says, nor on all sides inaccessible to 
<A NAME="362"></A>bribery (for how invincible soever he was against the gifts of Philip and 
<A NAME="363"></A>the Macedonians, yet elsewhere he lay open to assault, and was overpowered 
<A NAME="364"></A>by the gold which came down from Susa and Ecbatana), was therefore esteemed 
<A NAME="365"></A>better able to recommend than to imitate the virtues of past times. And 
<A NAME="366"></A>yet (excepting only Phocion), even in his life and manners, he far surpassed 
<A NAME="367"></A>the other orators of his time. None of them addressed the people so boldly; 
<A NAME="368"></A>he attacked the faults, and opposed himself to the unreasonable desires 
<A NAME="369"></A>of the multitude, as may be seen in his orations. Theopompus writes, that 
<A NAME="370"></A>the Athenians having by name selected Demosthenes, and called upon him 
<A NAME="371"></A>to accuse a certain person, he refused to do it; upon which the assembly 
<A NAME="372"></A>being all in an uproar, he rose up and said, "Your counsellor, whether 
<A NAME="373"></A>you will or no, O ye men of Athens, you shall always have me; but a sycophant 
<A NAME="374"></A>or false accuser, though you would have me, I shall never be." And his 
<A NAME="375"></A>conduct in the case of Antiphon was perfectly aristocratical; whom, after 
<A NAME="376"></A>he had been acquitted in the assembly, he took and brought before the court 
<A NAME="377"></A>of Areopagus, and, setting at naught the displeasure of the people, convicted 
<A NAME="378"></A>him there of having promised Philip to burn the arsenal; whereupon the 
<A NAME="379"></A>man was condemned by that court, and suffered for it. He accused, also, 
<A NAME="380"></A>Theoris, the priestess, amongst other misdemeanours, of having instructed 
<A NAME="381"></A>and taught the slaves to deceive and cheat their masters, for which the 
<A NAME="382"></A>sentence of death was passed upon her, and she was executed.
<A NAME="383"></A><BR><BR>The oration which Apollodorus made use of, and by it carried the 
<A NAME="384"></A>cause against Timotheus, the general, in an action of debt, it is said 
<A NAME="385"></A>was written for him by Demosthenes; as also those against Phormion and 
<A NAME="386"></A>Stephanus, in which latter case he was thought to have acted dishonourably, 
<A NAME="387"></A>for the speech which Phormion used against Apollodorus was also of his 
<A NAME="388"></A>making; he, as it were, having simply furnished two adversaries out of 
<A NAME="389"></A>the same shop with weapons to wound one another. Of his orations addressed 
<A NAME="390"></A>to the public assemblies, that against Androtion and those against Timocrates 
<A NAME="391"></A>and Aristocrates, were written for others, before he had come forward himself 
<A NAME="392"></A>as a politician. They were composed, it seems, when he was but seven or 
<A NAME="393"></A>eight and twenty years old. That against Aristogiton, and that for the 
<A NAME="394"></A>Immunities, he spoke himself, at the request, as he says, of Ctesippus, 
<A NAME="395"></A>the son of Chabrias, but, as some say, out of courtship to the young man's 
<A NAME="396"></A>mother. Though, in fact, he did not marry her, for his wife was a woman 
<A NAME="397"></A>of Samos, as Demetrius, the Magnesian, writes, in his book on Persons of 
<A NAME="398"></A>the same Name. It is not certain whether his oration against Aeschines, 
<A NAME="399"></A>for Misconduct as Ambassador, was ever spoken; although Idomeneus says 
<A NAME="400"></A>that Aeschines wanted only thirty voices to condemn him. But this seems 
<A NAME="401"></A>not to be correct, at least so far as may be conjectured from both their 
<A NAME="402"></A>orations concerning the Crown; for in these, neither of them speaks clearly 
<A NAME="403"></A>or directly of it, as a cause that ever came to trial. But let others decide 
<A NAME="404"></A>this controversy.
<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR>It was evident, even in time of peace, what course Demosthenes 
<A NAME="406"></A>would steer in the commonwealth; for whatever was done by the Macedonian, 
<A NAME="407"></A>he criticized and found fault with, and upon all occasions was stirring 
<A NAME="408"></A>up the people of Athens, and inflaming them against him. Therefore, in 
<A NAME="409"></A>the court of Philip, no man was so much talked of, or of so great account 
<A NAME="410"></A>as he; and when he came thither, one of the ten ambassadors who were sent 
<A NAME="411"></A>into Macedonia, though all had audience given them, yet his speech was 
<A NAME="412"></A>answered with most care and exactness. But in other respects, Philip entertained 
<A NAME="413"></A>him not so honourably as the rest, neither did he show him the same kindness 
<A NAME="414"></A>and civility with which he applied himself to the party of Aeschines and 
<A NAME="415"></A>Philocrates. So that, when the others commended Philip for his able speaking, 
<A NAME="416"></A>his beautiful person, nay, and also for his good companionship in drinking, 
<A NAME="417"></A>Demosthenes could not refrain from cavilling at these praises; the first, 
<A NAME="418"></A>he said, was a quality which might well enough become a rhetorician, the 
<A NAME="419"></A>second a woman, and the last was only the property of a sponge; no one 
<A NAME="420"></A>of them was the proper commendation of a prince.
<A NAME="421"></A><BR><BR>But when things came at last to war, Philip on the one side being 
<A NAME="422"></A>not able to live in peace, and the Athenians, on the other side, being 
<A NAME="423"></A>stirred up by Demosthenes, the first action he put them upon was the reducing 
<A NAME="424"></A>of Euboea, which, by the treachery of the tyrants, was brought under subjection 
<A NAME="425"></A>to Philip. And on his proposition, the decree was voted, and they crossed 
<A NAME="426"></A>over thither and chased the Macedonians out of the island. The next was 
<A NAME="427"></A>the relief of the Byzantines and Perinthians, whom the Macedonians at that 
<A NAME="428"></A>time were attacking. He persuaded the people to lay aside their enmity 
<A NAME="429"></A>against these cities, to forget the offences committed by them in the Confederate 
<A NAME="430"></A>War, and to send them such succours as eventually saved and secured them. 
<A NAME="431"></A>Not long after, he undertook an embassy through the states of Greece, which 
<A NAME="432"></A>he solicited and so far incensed against Philip that, a few only excepted, 
<A NAME="433"></A>he brought them all into a general league. So that, besides the forces 
<A NAME="434"></A>composed of the citizens themselves, there was an army consisting of fifteen 
<A NAME="435"></A>thousand foot and two thousand horse, and the money to pay these strangers 
<A NAME="436"></A>was levied and brought in with great cheerfulness. On which occasion it 
<A NAME="437"></A>was, says Theophrastus, on the allies requesting that their contributions 
<A NAME="438"></A>for the war might be ascertained and stated, Crobylus, the orator, made 
<A NAME="439"></A>use of the saying, "War can't be fed at so much a day." Now was all Greece 
<A NAME="440"></A>up in arms, and in great expectation what would be the event. The Euboeans, 
<A NAME="441"></A>the Achaeans, the Corinthians, the Megarians, the Leucadians, and Corcyraeans, 
<A NAME="442"></A>their people and their cities, were all joined together in a league. But 
<A NAME="443"></A>the hardest task was yet behind, left for Demosthenes, to draw the Thebans 
<A NAME="444"></A>into this confederacy with the rest. Their country bordered next upon Attica, 
<A NAME="445"></A>they had great forces for the war, and at that time they were accounted 
<A NAME="446"></A>the best soldiers of all Greece, but it was no easy matter to make them 
<A NAME="447"></A>break with Philip, who, by many good offices, had so lately obliged them 
<A NAME="448"></A>in the Phocian war; especially considering how the subjects of dispute 
<A NAME="449"></A>and variance between the two cities were continually renewed and exasperated 
<A NAME="450"></A>by petty quarrels, arising out of the proximity of their 
<A NAME="451"></A>frontiers.
<A NAME="452"></A><BR><BR>But after Philip, being now grown high and puffed up with his good 
<A NAME="453"></A>success at Amphissa, on a sudden surprised Elatea and possessed himself 
<A NAME="454"></A>of Phocis, and the Athenians were in a great consternation, none durst 
<A NAME="455"></A>venture to rise up to speak, no one knew what to say, all were at a loss, 
<A NAME="456"></A>and the whole assembly in silence and perplexity, in this extremity of 
<A NAME="457"></A>affairs Demosthenes was the only man who appeared, his counsel to them 
<A NAME="458"></A>being alliance with the Thebans. And having in other ways encouraged the 
<A NAME="459"></A>people, and, as his manner was, raised their spirits up with hopes, he, 
<A NAME="460"></A>with some others, was sent ambassador to Thebes. To oppose him, as Marsyas 
<A NAME="461"></A>says, Philip also sent thither his envoys, Amyntas and Clearchus, two Macedonians, 
<A NAME="462"></A>besides Daochus, a Thessalian, and Thrasydaeus. Now the Thebans, in their 
<A NAME="463"></A>consultations, were well enough aware what suited best with their own interest, 
<A NAME="464"></A>but every one had before his eyes the terrors of war, and their losses 
<A NAME="465"></A>in the Phocian troubles were still recent: but such was the force and power 
<A NAME="466"></A>of the orator, fanning up, as Theopompus says, their courage, and firing 
<A NAME="467"></A>their emulation, that, casting away every thought of prudence, fear, or 
<A NAME="468"></A>obligation, in a sort of divine possession, they chose the path of honour, 
<A NAME="469"></A>to which his words invited them. And this success, thus accomplished by 
<A NAME="470"></A>an orator, was thought to be so glorious and of such consequence, that 
<A NAME="471"></A>Philip immediately sent heralds to treat and petition for a peace: all 
<A NAME="472"></A>Greece was aroused, and up in arms to help. And the commanders-in-chief, 
<A NAME="473"></A>not only of Attica, but of Boeotia, applied themselves to Demosthenes, 
<A NAME="474"></A>and observed his directions. He managed all the assemblies of the Thebans, 
<A NAME="475"></A>no less than those of the Athenians; he was beloved both by the one and 
<A NAME="476"></A>by the other, and exercised the same supreme authority with both; and that 
<A NAME="477"></A>not by unfair means, or without just cause, as Theopompus professes, but 
<A NAME="478"></A>indeed it was no more than was due to his merit.
<A NAME="479"></A><BR><BR>But there was, it would seem, some divinely ordered fortune, commissioned, 
<A NAME="480"></A>in the revolution of things, to put a period at this time to the liberty 
<A NAME="481"></A>of Greece, which opposed and thwarted all their actions, and by many signs 
<A NAME="482"></A>foretold what should happen. Such were the sad predictions uttered by the 
<A NAME="483"></A>Pythian priestess, and this old oracle cited out of the Sibyl's 
<A NAME="484"></A>verses:-
<A NAME="485"></A><BR><BR>"The battle on Thermodon that shall be
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>Safe at a distance I desire to see,
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>Far, like an eagle, watching in the air,
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>Conquered shall weep, and conqueror perish there."
<A NAME="489"></A><BR><BR>This Thermodon, they say, is a little rivulet here in our country 
<A NAME="490"></A>in Chaeronea, running into the Cephisus. But we know of none that is so 
<A NAME="491"></A>called at the present time, and can only conjecture that the streamlet 
<A NAME="492"></A>which is now called Haemon, and runs by the Temple of Hercules, where the 
<A NAME="493"></A>Grecians were encamped, might perhaps in those days be called Thermodon, 
<A NAME="494"></A>and after the fight, being filled with blood and dead bodies, upon this 
<A NAME="495"></A>occasion, as we guess, might change its old name for that which it now 
<A NAME="496"></A>bears. Yet Duris says that this Thermodon was no river, but that some of 
<A NAME="497"></A>the soldiers, as they were pitching their tents and digging trenches about 
<A NAME="498"></A>them, found a small stone statue, which, by the inscription, appeared to 
<A NAME="499"></A>be the figure of Thermodon, carrying a wounded Amazon in his arms; and 
<A NAME="500"></A>that there was another oracle current about it, as follows:-
<A NAME="501"></A><BR><BR>"The battle on Thermodon that shall be,
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>Fail not, black raven, to attend and see;
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>The flesh of men shall there abound for thee."
<A NAME="504"></A><BR><BR>In fine, it is not easy to determine what is the truth. But of 
<A NAME="505"></A>Demosthenes it is said that he had such great confidence in the Grecian 
<A NAME="506"></A>forces, and was so excited by the sight of the courage and resolution of 
<A NAME="507"></A>so many brave men ready to engage the enemy, that he would by no means 
<A NAME="508"></A>endure they should give any heed to oracles, or hearken to prophecies, 
<A NAME="509"></A>but gave out that he suspected even the prophetess herself, as if she had 
<A NAME="510"></A>been tampered with to speak in favour of Philip. The Thebans he put in 
<A NAME="511"></A>mind of Epaminondas, the Athenians of Pericles, who always took their own 
<A NAME="512"></A>measures and governed their actions by reason, looking upon things of this 
<A NAME="513"></A>kind as mere pretexts for cowardice. Thus far, therefore, Demosthenes acquitted 
<A NAME="514"></A>himself like a brave man. But in the fight he did nothing honourable, nor 
<A NAME="515"></A>was his performance answerable to his speeches. For he fled, deserting 
<A NAME="516"></A>his place disgracefully, and throwing away his arms, not ashamed, as Pytheas 
<A NAME="517"></A>observed, to belie the inscription written on his shield, in letters of 
<A NAME="518"></A>gold, "With good fortune."
<A NAME="519"></A><BR><BR>In the meantime Philip, in the first moment of victory, was so 
<A NAME="520"></A>transported with joy, that he grew extravagant, and going out after he 
<A NAME="521"></A>had drunk largely to visit the dead bodies, he chanted the first words 
<A NAME="522"></A>of the decree that had been passed on the motion of 
<A NAME="523"></A>Demosthenes-
<A NAME="524"></A><BR><BR>"The motion of Demosthenes, Demosthenes's son," dividing it metrically 
<A NAME="525"></A>into feet, and marking the beats.
<A NAME="526"></A><BR><BR>But when he came to himself, and had well considered the danger 
<A NAME="527"></A>he was lately under, he could not forbear from shuddering at the wonderful 
<A NAME="528"></A>ability and power of an orator who had made him hazard his life and empire 
<A NAME="529"></A>on the issue of a few brief hours. The fame of it also reached even to 
<A NAME="530"></A>the court of Persia, and the king sent letters to his lieutenants commanding 
<A NAME="531"></A>them to supply Demosthenes with money, and to pay every attention to him, 
<A NAME="532"></A>as the only man of all the Grecians who was able to give Philip occupation 
<A NAME="533"></A>and find employment for his forces near home, in the troubles of Greece. 
<A NAME="534"></A>This, afterwards came to the knowledge of Alexander, by certain letters 
<A NAME="535"></A>of Demosthenes which he found at Sardis, and by other papers of the Persian 
<A NAME="536"></A>officers, stating the large sums which had been given 
<A NAME="537"></A>him.
<A NAME="538"></A><BR><BR>At this time, however, upon the ill-success which now happened 
<A NAME="539"></A>to the Grecians, those of the contrary faction in the commonwealth fell 
<A NAME="540"></A>foul upon Demosthenes and took the opportunity to frame several informations 
<A NAME="541"></A>and indictments against him. But the people not only acquitted him of these 
<A NAME="542"></A>accusations, but continued towards him their former respect, and still 
<A NAME="543"></A>invited him, as a man that meant well, to take a part in public affairs. 
<A NAME="544"></A>Insomuch that when the bones of those who had been slain at Chaeronea were 
<A NAME="545"></A>brought home to be solemnly interred, Demosthenes was the man they chose 
<A NAME="546"></A>to make the funeral oration. They did not show, under the misfortunes which 
<A NAME="547"></A>befell them, a base or ignoble mind, as Theopompus writes in his exaggerated 
<A NAME="548"></A>style, but on the contrary, by the honour and respect paid to their counsellor, 
<A NAME="549"></A>they made it appear that they were noway dissatisfied with the counsels 
<A NAME="550"></A>he had given them. The speech, therefore, was spoken by Demosthenes. But 
<A NAME="551"></A>the subsequent decrees he would not allow to be passed in his own name, 
<A NAME="552"></A>but made use of those of his friends, one after another, looking upon his 
<A NAME="553"></A>own as unfortunate and inauspicious; till at length he took courage again 
<A NAME="554"></A>after the death of Philip, who did not long outlive his victory at Chaeronea. 
<A NAME="555"></A>And this, it seems, was that which was foretold in the last verse of the 
<A NAME="556"></A>oracle-
<A NAME="557"></A><BR><BR>"Conquered shall weep, and conqueror perish there." Demosthenes 
<A NAME="558"></A>had secret intelligence of the death of Philip, and laying hold of this 
<A NAME="559"></A>opportunity to prepossess the people with courage and better hopes for 
<A NAME="560"></A>the future, he came into the assembly with a cheerful countenance, pretending 
<A NAME="561"></A>to have had a dream that presaged some great good fortune for Athens; and, 
<A NAME="562"></A>not long after, arrived the messengers who brought the news of Philip's 
<A NAME="563"></A>death. No sooner had the people received it, but immediately they offered 
<A NAME="564"></A>sacrifice to the gods, and decreed that Pausanias should be presented with 
<A NAME="565"></A>a crown. Demosthenes appeared publicly in a rich dress, with a chaplet 
<A NAME="566"></A>on his head, though it were but the seventh day since the death of his 
<A NAME="567"></A>daughter, as is said by Aeschines, who upbraids him upon this account, 
<A NAME="568"></A>and rails at him as one void of natural affection towards his children. 
<A NAME="569"></A>Whereas, indeed, he rather betrays himself to be of a poor, low spirit, 
<A NAME="570"></A>and effeminate mind, if he really means to make wailings and lamentation 
<A NAME="571"></A>the only signs of a gentle and affectionate nature, and to condemn those 
<A NAME="572"></A>who bear such accidents with more temper and less passion. For my own part, 
<A NAME="573"></A>I cannot say that the behaviour of the Athenians on this occasion was wise 
<A NAME="574"></A>or honourable, to crown themselves with garlands and to sacrifice to the 
<A NAME="575"></A>gods for the death of a prince who, in the midst of his success and victories, 
<A NAME="576"></A>when they were a conquered people, had used them with so much clemency 
<A NAME="577"></A>and humanity. For besides provoking fortune, it was a base thing, and unworthy 
<A NAME="578"></A>in itself, to make him a citizen of Athens, and pay him honours while he 
<A NAME="579"></A>lived, and yet as soon as he fell by another's hand, to set no bounds to 
<A NAME="580"></A>their jollity, to insult over him dead, and to sing triumphant songs of 
<A NAME="581"></A>victory, as if by their own valour they had vanquished him. I must at the 
<A NAME="582"></A>same time commend the behaviour of Demosthenes, who, leaving tears and 
<A NAME="583"></A>lamentations and domestic sorrows to the women, made it his business to 
<A NAME="584"></A>attend to the interests of the commonwealth. And I think it the duty of 
<A NAME="585"></A>him who would be accounted to have a soul truly valiant, and fit for government, 
<A NAME="586"></A>that, standing always firm to the common good, and letting private griefs 
<A NAME="587"></A>and troubles find their compensation in public blessings, he should maintain 
<A NAME="588"></A>the dignity of his character and station, much more than actors who represent 
<A NAME="589"></A>the persons of kings and tyrants, who, we see, when they either laugh or 
<A NAME="590"></A>weep on the stage, follow, not their own private inclinations, but the 
<A NAME="591"></A>course consistent with the subject and with their position. And if, moreover, 
<A NAME="592"></A>when our neighbour is in misfortune, it is not our duty to forbear offering 
<A NAME="593"></A>any consolation, but rather to say whatever may tend to cheer him, and 
<A NAME="594"></A>to invite his attention to any agreeable objects, just as we tell people 
<A NAME="595"></A>who are troubled with sore eyes to withdraw their sight from bright and 
<A NAME="596"></A>offensive colours to green, and those of a softer mixture, from whence 
<A NAME="597"></A>can a man seek, in his own case, better arguments of consolation for afflictions 
<A NAME="598"></A>in his family, than from the prosperity of his country, by making public 
<A NAME="599"></A>and domestic chances count, so to say, together, and the better fortune 
<A NAME="600"></A>of the state obscure and conceal the less happy circumstances of the individual. 
<A NAME="601"></A>I have been induced to say so much, because I have known many readers melted 
<A NAME="602"></A>by Aeschines's language into a soft and unmanly tenderness.
<A NAME="603"></A><BR><BR>But now to turn to my narrative. The cities of Greece were inspirited 
<A NAME="604"></A>once more by the efforts of Demosthenes to form a league together. The 
<A NAME="605"></A>Thebans, whom he had provided with arms, set upon their garrison, and slew 
<A NAME="606"></A>many of them; the Athenians made preparations to join their forces with 
<A NAME="607"></A>them; Demosthenes ruled supreme in the popular assembly, and wrote letters 
<A NAME="608"></A>to the Persian officers who commanded under the king in Asia, inciting 
<A NAME="609"></A>them to make war upon the Macedonian, calling him child and simpleton. 
<A NAME="610"></A>But as soon as Alexander had settled matters in his own country, and came 
<A NAME="611"></A>in person with his army into Boeotia, down fell the courage of the Athenians, 
<A NAME="612"></A>and Demosthenes was hushed; the Thebans, deserted by them, fought by themselves, 
<A NAME="613"></A>and lost their city. After which, the people of Athens, all in distress 
<A NAME="614"></A>and great perplexity, resolved to send ambassadors to Alexander, and amongst 
<A NAME="615"></A>others, made choice of Demosthenes for one; but his heart failing him for 
<A NAME="616"></A>fear of the king's anger, he returned back from Cithaeron, and left the 
<A NAME="617"></A>embassy. In the meantime, Alexander sent to Athens, requiring ten of their 
<A NAME="618"></A>orators to be delivered up to him, as Idomeneus and Duris have reported, 
<A NAME="619"></A>but as the most and best historians say, he demanded these eight only,- 
<A NAME="620"></A>Demosthenes, Polyeuctus, Ephialtes, Lycurgus, Moerocles, Demon, Callisthenes, 
<A NAME="621"></A>and Charidemus. It was upon this occasion that Demosthenes related to them 
<A NAME="622"></A>the fable in which the sheep are said to deliver up their dogs to the wolves; 
<A NAME="623"></A>himself and those who with him contended for the people's safety being, 
<A NAME="624"></A>in his comparison, the dogs that defended the flock, and Alexander "the 
<A NAME="625"></A>Macedonian arch-wolf." He further told them, "As we see corn-masters sell 
<A NAME="626"></A>their whole stock by a few grains of wheat which they carry about with 
<A NAME="627"></A>them in a dish, as a sample of the rest, so you by delivering up us, who 
<A NAME="628"></A>are but a few, do at the same time unawares surrender up yourselves all 
<A NAME="629"></A>together with us so we find it related in the history of Aristobulus, the 
<A NAME="630"></A>Cassandrian. The Athenians were deliberating, and at a loss what to do, 
<A NAME="631"></A>when Demades, having agreed with the persons whom Alexander had demanded, 
<A NAME="632"></A>for five talents, undertook to go ambassador, and to intercede with the 
<A NAME="633"></A>king for them; and, whether it was that he relied on his friendship and 
<A NAME="634"></A>kindness, or that he hoped to find him satiated, as a lion glutted with 
<A NAME="635"></A>slaughter, he certainly went, and prevailed with him both to pardon the 
<A NAME="636"></A>men, and to be reconciled to the city.
<A NAME="637"></A><BR><BR>So he and his friends, when Alexander went away, were great men, 
<A NAME="638"></A>and Demosthenes was quite put aside. Yet when Agis, the Spartan, made his 
<A NAME="639"></A>insurrection, he also for a short time attempted a movement in his favour; 
<A NAME="640"></A>but he soon shrunk back again, as the Athenians would not take any part 
<A NAME="641"></A>in it, and, Agis being slain, the Lacedaemonians were vanquished. During 
<A NAME="642"></A>this time it was that the indictment against Ctesiphon, concerning the 
<A NAME="643"></A>crown, was brought to trial. The action was commenced a little before the 
<A NAME="644"></A>battle in Chaeronea, when Chaerondas was archon, but it was not proceeded 
<A NAME="645"></A>with till about ten years after, Aristophon being then archon. Never was 
<A NAME="646"></A>any public cause more celebrated than this, alike for the fame of the orators, 
<A NAME="647"></A>and for the generous courage of the judges, who, though at that time the 
<A NAME="648"></A>accusers of Demosthenes were in the height of power, and supported by all 
<A NAME="649"></A>the favour of the Macedonians, yet would not give judgment against him, 
<A NAME="650"></A>but acquitted him so honourably, that Aeschines did not obtain the fifth 
<A NAME="651"></A>part of their suffrages on his side, so that, immediately after, he left 
<A NAME="652"></A>the city, and spent the rest of his life in teaching rhetoric about the 
<A NAME="653"></A>island of Rhodes, and upon the continent in Ionia.
<A NAME="654"></A><BR><BR>It was not long after that Harpalus fled from Alexander, and came 
<A NAME="655"></A>to Athens out of Asia; knowing himself guilty of many misdeeds into which 
<A NAME="656"></A>his love of luxury had led him, and fearing the king, who was now grown 
<A NAME="657"></A>terrible even to his best friends. Yet this man had no sooner addressed 
<A NAME="658"></A>himself to the people, and delivered up his goods, his ships, and himself 
<A NAME="659"></A>to their disposal, but the other orators of the town had their eyes quickly 
<A NAME="660"></A>fixed upon his money, and came in to his assistance, persuading the Athenians 
<A NAME="661"></A>to receive and protect their suppliant. Demosthenes at first gave advice 
<A NAME="662"></A>to chase him out of the country, and to beware lest they involved their 
<A NAME="663"></A>city in a war upon an unnecessary and unjust occasion. But some few days 
<A NAME="664"></A>after, as they were taking an account of the treasure, Harpalus, perceiving 
<A NAME="665"></A>how much he was pleased with a cup of Persian manufacture, and how curiously 
<A NAME="666"></A>he surveyed the sculpture and fashion of it, desired him to poise it in 
<A NAME="667"></A>his hand, and consider the weight of the gold. Demosthenes, being amazed 
<A NAME="668"></A>to feel how heavy it was, asked him what weight it came to. "To you," said 
<A NAME="669"></A>Harpalus, smiling, "it shall come with twenty talents." And presently after, 
<A NAME="670"></A>when night drew on, he sent him the cup with so many talents. Harpalus, 
<A NAME="671"></A>it seems, was a person of singular skill to discern a man's covetousness 
<A NAME="672"></A>by the air of his countenance, and the look and movements of his eyes. 
<A NAME="673"></A>For Demosthenes could not resist the temptation, but admitting the present, 
<A NAME="674"></A>like an armed garrison, into the citadel of his house, he surrendered himself 
<A NAME="675"></A>up to the interest of Harpalus. The next day, he came into the assembly 
<A NAME="676"></A>with his neck swathed about with wool and rollers, and when they called 
<A NAME="677"></A>on him to rise up and speak, he made signs as if he had lost his voice. 
<A NAME="678"></A>But the wits, turning the matter to ridicule, said that certainly the orator 
<A NAME="679"></A>had been seized that night with no other than a silver quinsy. And soon 
<A NAME="680"></A>after, the people, becoming aware of the bribery, grew angry, and would 
<A NAME="681"></A>not suffer him to speak, or make any apology for himself, but ran him down 
<A NAME="682"></A>with noise; and one man stood up, and cried out, "What, ye men of Athens, 
<A NAME="683"></A>will you not hear the cup-bearer?" So at length they banished Harpalus 
<A NAME="684"></A>out of the city; and fearing lest they should be called to account for 
<A NAME="685"></A>the treasure which the orators had purloined, they made a strict inquiry, 
<A NAME="686"></A>going from house to house; only Callicles, the son of Arrhenidas, who was 
<A NAME="687"></A>newly married, they would not suffer to be searched, out of respects, as 
<A NAME="688"></A>Theopompus writes, to the bride, who was within.
<A NAME="689"></A><BR><BR>Demosthenes resisted the inquisition, and proposed a decree to 
<A NAME="690"></A>refer the business to the court of Areopagus, and to punish those whom 
<A NAME="691"></A>that court should find guilty. But being himself one of the first whom 
<A NAME="692"></A>the court condemned, when he came to the bar, he was fined fifty talents, 
<A NAME="693"></A>and committed to prison; where, out of shame of the crime for which he 
<A NAME="694"></A>was condemned, and through the weakness of his body, growing incapable 
<A NAME="695"></A>of supporting the confinement, he made his escape, by the carelessness 
<A NAME="696"></A>of some and by the contrivance of others of the citizens. We are told, 
<A NAME="697"></A>at least, that he had not fled far from the city when, finding that he 
<A NAME="698"></A>was pursued by some of those who had been his adversaries, he endeavoured 
<A NAME="699"></A>to hide himself. But when they called him by his name, and coming up nearer 
<A NAME="700"></A>to him, desired he would accept from them some money which they had brought 
<A NAME="701"></A>from home as a provision for his journey, and to that purpose only had 
<A NAME="702"></A>followed him, when they entreated him to take courage, and to bear up against 
<A NAME="703"></A>his misfortune, he burst out into much greater lamentation, saying, "But 
<A NAME="704"></A>how is it possible to support myself under so heavy an affliction, since 
<A NAME="705"></A>I leave a city in which I have such enemies, as in any other it is not 
<A NAME="706"></A>easy to find friends." He did not show much fortitude in his banishment, 
<A NAME="707"></A>spending his time for the most part in Aegina and Troezen, and, with tears 
<A NAME="708"></A>in his eyes, looking towards the country of Attica. And there remain upon 
<A NAME="709"></A>record some sayings of his, little resembling those sentiments of generosity 
<A NAME="710"></A>and bravery which he used to express when he had the management of the 
<A NAME="711"></A>commonwealth. For, as he was departing out of the city, it is reported, 
<A NAME="712"></A>he lifted up his hands towards the Acropolis, and said, "O Lady Minerva, 
<A NAME="713"></A>how is it that thou takest delight in three such fierce untractable beasts, 
<A NAME="714"></A>the owl, the snake, and the people?" The young men that came to visit and 
<A NAME="715"></A>converse with him, he deterred from meddling with state affairs, telling 
<A NAME="716"></A>them, that if at first two ways had been proposed to him, the one leading 
<A NAME="717"></A>to the speaker's stand and the assembly, the other going direct to destruction, 
<A NAME="718"></A>and he could have foreseen the many evils which attend those who deal in 
<A NAME="719"></A>public business, such as fears, envies, calumnies, and contentions, he 
<A NAME="720"></A>would certainly have taken that which led straight on to his 
<A NAME="721"></A>death.
<A NAME="722"></A><BR><BR>But now happened the death of Alexander, while Demosthenes was 
<A NAME="723"></A>in this banishment which we have been speaking of. And the Grecians were 
<A NAME="724"></A>once again up in arms, encouraged by the brave attempts of Leosthenes, 
<A NAME="725"></A>who was then drawing a circumvallation about Antipater, whom he held close 
<A NAME="726"></A>besieged in Lamia. Pytheas, therefore, the orator, and Callimedon, called 
<A NAME="727"></A>the Crab, fled from Athens, and taking sides with Antipater, went about 
<A NAME="728"></A>with his friends and ambassadors to keep the Grecians from revolting and 
<A NAME="729"></A>taking part with the Athenians. But, on the other side, Demosthenes, associating 
<A NAME="730"></A>himself with the ambassadors that came from Athens, used his utmost endeavours 
<A NAME="731"></A>and gave them his best assistance in persuading the cities to fall unanimously 
<A NAME="732"></A>upon the Macedonians, and to drive them out of Greece. Phylarchus says 
<A NAME="733"></A>that in Arcadia there happened a rencounter between Pytheas and Demosthenes, 
<A NAME="734"></A>which came at last to downright railing, while the one pleaded for the 
<A NAME="735"></A>Macedonians, and the other for the Grecians. Pytheas said, that as we always 
<A NAME="736"></A>suppose there is some disease in the family to which they bring asses' 
<A NAME="737"></A>milk, so wherever there comes an embassy from Athens that city must needs 
<A NAME="738"></A>be indisposed. And Demosthenes answered him, retorting the comparison: 
<A NAME="739"></A>"Asses' milk is brought to restore health and the Athenians come for the 
<A NAME="740"></A>safety and recovery of the sick." With this conduct the people of Athens 
<A NAME="741"></A>were so well pleased that they decreed the recall of Demosthenes from banishment. 
<A NAME="742"></A>The decree was brought in by Demon the Paeanian, cousin to Demosthenes. 
<A NAME="743"></A>So they sent him a ship to Aegina, and he landed at the port of Piraeus, 
<A NAME="744"></A>where he was met and joyfully received by all the citizens, not so much 
<A NAME="745"></A>as an archon or a priest staying behind. And Demetrius, the Magnesian, 
<A NAME="746"></A>says that he lifted up his hands towards heaven, and blessed this day of 
<A NAME="747"></A>his happy return, as far more honourable than that of Alcibiades; since 
<A NAME="748"></A>he was recalled by his countrymen, not through any force or constraint 
<A NAME="749"></A>put upon them, but by their own good-will and free inclinations. There 
<A NAME="750"></A>remained only his pecuniary fine, which, according to law, could not be 
<A NAME="751"></A>remitted by the people. But they found out a way to elude the law. It was 
<A NAME="752"></A>a custom with them to allow a certain quantity of silver to those who were 
<A NAME="753"></A>to furnish and adorn the altar for the sacrifice of Jupiter Soter. This 
<A NAME="754"></A>office, for that turn, they bestowed on Demosthenes, and for the performance 
<A NAME="755"></A>of it ordered him fifty talents, the very sum in which he was 
<A NAME="756"></A>condemned.
<A NAME="757"></A><BR><BR>Yet it was no long time that he enjoyed his country after his return, 
<A NAME="758"></A>the attempts of the Greeks being soon all utterly defeated. For the battle 
<A NAME="759"></A>of Cranon happened in Metagitnion, in Boedromion the garrison entered into 
<A NAME="760"></A>Munychia, and in the Pyanepsion following died Demosthenes after this 
<A NAME="761"></A>manner.
<A NAME="762"></A><BR><BR>Upon the report that Antipater and Craterus were coming to Athens, 
<A NAME="763"></A>Demosthenes with his party took their opportunity to escape privily out 
<A NAME="764"></A>of the city; but sentence of death was, upon the motion of Demades, passed 
<A NAME="765"></A>upon them by the people. They dispersed themselves, flying some to one 
<A NAME="766"></A>place, some to another; and Antipater sent about his soldiers into all 
<A NAME="767"></A>quarters to apprehend them. Archias was their captain, and was thence called 
<A NAME="768"></A>the exile-hunter. He was a Thurian born, and is reported to have been an 
<A NAME="769"></A>actor of tragedies, and they say that Polus, of Aegina, the best actor 
<A NAME="770"></A>of his time, was his scholar; but Hermippus reckons Archias among the disciples 
<A NAME="771"></A>of Lacritus, the orator, and Demetrius says he spent some time with Anaximenes. 
<A NAME="772"></A>This Archias finding Hyperides the orator, Aritonicus of Marathon, and 
<A NAME="773"></A>Himeraeus, the brother of Demetrius the Phalerian, in Aegina, took them 
<A NAME="774"></A>by force out of the temple of Aecus, whither they were fled for safety, 
<A NAME="775"></A>and sent them to Antipater, then at Cleonae where they were all put to 
<A NAME="776"></A>death; and Hyperides, they say, had his tongue cut out.
<A NAME="777"></A><BR><BR>Demosthenes, he heard, had taken sanctuary at the temple of Neptune 
<A NAME="778"></A>in Calauria and, crossing over thither in some light vessels, as soon as 
<A NAME="779"></A>he had landed himself, and the Thracian spearmen that came with him, he 
<A NAME="780"></A>endeavoured to persuade Demosthenes to accompany him to Antipater, as if 
<A NAME="781"></A>he should meet with no hard usage from him. But Demosthenes, in his sleep 
<A NAME="782"></A>the night before, had a strange dream. It seemed to him that he was acting 
<A NAME="783"></A>a tragedy, and contended with Archias for the victory; and though he acquitted 
<A NAME="784"></A>himself well, and gave good satisfaction to the spectators, yet for want 
<A NAME="785"></A>of better furniture and provision for the stage, he lost the day. And so, 
<A NAME="786"></A>while Archias was discoursing to him with many expressions of kindness, 
<A NAME="787"></A>he sate still in the same posture, and looking up steadfastly upon him, 
<A NAME="788"></A>"O Archias," said he, "I am as little affected by your promises now as 
<A NAME="789"></A>I used formerly to be by your acting." Archias at this beginning to grow 
<A NAME="790"></A>angry and to threaten him, "Now," said Demosthenes, "you speak like the 
<A NAME="791"></A>genuine Macedonian oracle; before you were but acting a part. Therefore 
<A NAME="792"></A>forbear only a little, while I write a word or two home to my family." 
<A NAME="793"></A>Having thus spoken, he withdrew into the temple and taking a scroll as 
<A NAME="794"></A>if he meant to write, he put the reed into his mouth, and biting it as 
<A NAME="795"></A>he was wont to do when he was thoughtful or writing, he held it there some 
<A NAME="796"></A>time. Then he bowed down his head and covered it. The soldiers that stood 
<A NAME="797"></A>at the door, supposing all this to proceed from want of courage and fear 
<A NAME="798"></A>of death, in derision called him effeminate, and faint-hearted, and coward. 
<A NAME="799"></A>And Archias drawing near, desired him to rise up, and repeating the same 
<A NAME="800"></A>kind of thing he had spoken before, he once more promised to make his peace 
<A NAME="801"></A>with Antipater. But Demosthenes, perceiving that now the poison had pierced, 
<A NAME="802"></A>and seized his vitals, uncovered his head, and fixing his eyes upon Archias, 
<A NAME="803"></A>"Now," said he, "as soon as you please, you may commence the part of Creon 
<A NAME="804"></A>in the tragedy, and cast out this body of mine unburied. But, O gracious 
<A NAME="805"></A>Neptune, I, for my part while I am yet alive will rise up and depart out 
<A NAME="806"></A>of this sacred place; though Antipater and the Macedonians have not left 
<A NAME="807"></A>so much as thy temple unpolluted." After he had thus spoken and desired 
<A NAME="808"></A>to be held up, because already he began to tremble and stagger, as he was 
<A NAME="809"></A>going forward, and passing by the altar, he fell down, and with a groan 
<A NAME="810"></A>gave up the ghost.
<A NAME="811"></A><BR><BR>Ariston says that he took the poison out of a reed, as we have 
<A NAME="812"></A>shown before. But Pappus, a certain historian whose history was recovered 
<A NAME="813"></A>by Hermippus, says, that as he fell near the altar, there was found in 
<A NAME="814"></A>his scroll this beginning only of a letter, and nothing more, "Demosthenes 
<A NAME="815"></A>to Antipater." And that when his sudden death was much wondered at, the 
<A NAME="816"></A>Thracians who guarded the doors reported that he took the poison into his 
<A NAME="817"></A>hand out of a rag, and put it in his mouth, and that they imagined it had 
<A NAME="818"></A>been gold which he swallowed, but the maid that served him, being examined 
<A NAME="819"></A>by the followers of Archias, affirmed that he had worn it in a bracelet 
<A NAME="820"></A>for a long time, as an amulet. And Eratosthenes also says that he kept 
<A NAME="821"></A>the poison in a hollow ring, and that that ring was the bracelet which 
<A NAME="822"></A>he wore about his arm. There are various other statements made by the many 
<A NAME="823"></A>authors who have related the story, but there is no need to enter into 
<A NAME="824"></A>their discrepancies; yet I must not omit what is said by Demochares the 
<A NAME="825"></A>relation of Demosthenes, who is of opinion it was not by the help of poison 
<A NAME="826"></A>that he met with so sudden and so easy a death, but that by the singular 
<A NAME="827"></A>favour and providence of the gods he was thus rescued from the cruelty 
<A NAME="828"></A>of the Macedonians. He died on the sixteenth of Pyanepsion, the most sad 
<A NAME="829"></A>and solemn day of the Thesmophoria, which the women observe by fasting 
<A NAME="830"></A>in the temple of the goddess.
<A NAME="831"></A><BR><BR>Soon after his death, the people of Athens bestowed on him such 
<A NAME="832"></A>honours as he had deserved. They erected his statue of brass; they decreed 
<A NAME="833"></A>that the eldest of his family should be maintained in the Prytaneum; and 
<A NAME="834"></A>on the base of his statue was engraven the famous inscription-
<A NAME="835"></A><BR><BR>"Had you for Greece been strong, as wise you 
<A NAME="836"></A>were,
<A NAME="837"></A><BR>The Macedonian had not conquered her." For it is simply ridiculous 
<A NAME="838"></A>to say, as some have related, that Demosthenes made these verses himself 
<A NAME="839"></A>in Calauria, as he was about to take the poison.
<A NAME="840"></A><BR><BR>A little before he went to Athens, the following incident was said 
<A NAME="841"></A>to have happened. A soldier, being summoned to appear before his superior 
<A NAME="842"></A>officer, and answer to an accusation brought against him, put that little 
<A NAME="843"></A>gold which he had into the hands of Demosthenes's statue. The fingers of 
<A NAME="844"></A>this statue were folded one within another, and near it grew a small plane-tree, 
<A NAME="845"></A>from which many leaves, either accidently blown thither by the wind, or 
<A NAME="846"></A>placed so on purpose by the man himself, falling together and lying round 
<A NAME="847"></A>about the gold, concealed it for a long time. In the end, the soldier returned 
<A NAME="848"></A>and found his treasure entire, and the fame of this incident was spread 
<A NAME="849"></A>abroad. And many ingenious persons of the city competed with each other, 
<A NAME="850"></A>on this occasion, to vindicate the integrity of Demosthenes in several 
<A NAME="851"></A>epigrams which they made on the subject.
<A NAME="852"></A><BR><BR>As for Demades, he did not long enjoy the new honours he now came 
<A NAME="853"></A>in for, divine vengeance for the death of Demosthenes pursuing him into 
<A NAME="854"></A>Macedonia, where he was justly put to death by those whom he had basely 
<A NAME="855"></A>flattered. They were weary of him before, but at this time the guilt he 
<A NAME="856"></A>lay under was manifest and undeniable. For some of his letters were intercepted, 
<A NAME="857"></A>in which he had encouraged Perdiccas to fall upon Macedonia, and to save 
<A NAME="858"></A>the Grecians, who, he said, hung only by an old rotten thread meaning Antipater. 
<A NAME="859"></A>Of this he was accused by Dinarchus, the Corinthian, and Cassander was 
<A NAME="860"></A>so enraged, that he first slew his son in his bosom, and then gave orders 
<A NAME="861"></A>to execute him; who might now at last, by his own extreme misfortunes, 
<A NAME="862"></A>learn the lesson that traitors who made sale of their country sell themselves 
<A NAME="863"></A>first; a truth which Demosthenes had often foretold him, and he would never 
<A NAME="864"></A>believe. Thus, Sosius, you have the life of Demosthenes from such accounts 
<A NAME="865"></A>as we have either read or heard concerning him.
