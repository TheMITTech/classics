<A NAME="2"></A><BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>These are the most memorable circumstances recorded in history of Demosthenes 
<A NAME="11"></A>and Cicero which have come to our knowledge. But omitting an exact comparison 
<A NAME="12"></A>of their respective faculties in speaking, yet thus much seems fit to be 
<A NAME="13"></A>said; that Demosthenes, to make himself a master in rhetoric, applied all 
<A NAME="14"></A>the faculties he had, natural or acquired, wholly that way that he far 
<A NAME="15"></A>surpassed in force and strength of eloquence all his contemporaries in 
<A NAME="16"></A>political and judicial speaking, in grandeur and majesty all the panegyrical 
<A NAME="17"></A>orators, and in accuracy and science all the logicians and rhetoricians 
<A NAME="18"></A>of his day; that Cicero was highly educated, and by his diligent study 
<A NAME="19"></A>became a most accomplished general scholar in all these branches, having 
<A NAME="20"></A>left behind him numerous philosophical treatises of his own on Academic 
<A NAME="21"></A>principles as, indeed, even in his written speeches, both political and 
<A NAME="22"></A>judicial, we see him continually trying to show his learning by the way. 
<A NAME="23"></A>And one may discover the different temper of each of them in their speeches. 
<A NAME="24"></A>For Demosthenes's oratory was without all embellishment and jesting, wholly 
<A NAME="25"></A>composed for real effect and seriousness; not smelling of the lamp, as 
<A NAME="26"></A>Pytheas scoffingly said, but of the temperance, thoughtfulness, austerity, 
<A NAME="27"></A>and grave earnestness of his temper. Whereas Cicero's love of mockery often 
<A NAME="28"></A>ran him into scurrility; and in his love of laughing away serious arguments 
<A NAME="29"></A>in judicial cases by jests and facetious remarks, with a view to the advantage 
<A NAME="30"></A>of his clients, he paid too little regard to what was decent: saying, for 
<A NAME="31"></A>example, in his defence of Caelius, that he had done no absurd thing in 
<A NAME="32"></A>such plenty and affluence to indulge himself in pleasures, it being a kind 
<A NAME="33"></A>of madness not to enjoy the things we possess, especially since the most 
<A NAME="34"></A>eminent philosophers have asserted pleasures to be the chiefest good. So 
<A NAME="35"></A>also we are told that when Cicero, being consul, undertook the defence 
<A NAME="36"></A>of Murena against Cato's prosecution, by way of bantering Cato, he made 
<A NAME="37"></A>a long series of jokes upon the absurd paradoxes, as they are called, of 
<A NAME="38"></A>the Stoic set; so that a loud laughter passing from the crowd to the judges, 
<A NAME="39"></A>Cato, with a quiet smile, said to those that sat next him, "My friends, 
<A NAME="40"></A>what an amusing consul we have."
<A NAME="41"></A><BR><BR>And, indeed, Cicero was by natural temper very much disposed to 
<A NAME="42"></A>mirth and pleasantry, and always appeared with a smiling and serene countenance. 
<A NAME="43"></A>But Demosthenes had constant care and thoughtfulness in his look, and a 
<A NAME="44"></A>serious anxiety, which he seldom, if ever, laid aside; and therefore, was 
<A NAME="45"></A>accounted by his enemies, as he himself confessed, morose and 
<A NAME="46"></A>ill-mannered.
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR>Also, it is very evident, out of their several writings, that Demosthenes 
<A NAME="48"></A>never touched upon his own praises but decently and without offence when 
<A NAME="49"></A>there was need of it and for some weightier end; but upon other occasions 
<A NAME="50"></A>modestly and sparingly. But Cicero's immeasurable boasting of himself in 
<A NAME="51"></A>his orations argues him guilty of an uncontrollable appetite for distinction, 
<A NAME="52"></A>his cry being evermore that arms should give place to the gown, and the 
<A NAME="53"></A>soldier's laurel to the tongue. And at last we find him extolling not only 
<A NAME="54"></A>his deeds and actions, but his orations also, as well those that were only 
<A NAME="55"></A>spoken, as those that were published; as if he were engaged in a boyish 
<A NAME="56"></A>trial of skill, who should speak best, with the rhetoricians, Isocrates 
<A NAME="57"></A>and Anaximenes, not as one who could claim the task to guide and instruct 
<A NAME="58"></A>the Roman nation, the-
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR>"Soldier full-armed, terrific to the foe."
<A NAME="60"></A><BR><BR>It is necessary, indeed, for a political leader to be an able speaker; 
<A NAME="61"></A>but it is an ignoble thing for any man to admire and relish the glory of 
<A NAME="62"></A>his own eloquence. And, in this matter, Demosthenes had a more than ordinary 
<A NAME="63"></A>gravity and magnificence of mind, accounting his talent in speaking nothing 
<A NAME="64"></A>more than a mere accomplishment and matter of practice, the success of 
<A NAME="65"></A>which must depend greatly on the good-will and candour of his hearers, 
<A NAME="66"></A>and regarding those who pride themselves on such accounts to be men of 
<A NAME="67"></A>a low and petty disposition.
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR>The power of persuading and governing the people did, indeed, equally 
<A NAME="69"></A>belong to both, so that those who had armies and camps at command stood 
<A NAME="70"></A>in need of their assistance; as Charas, Diopithes, and Leosthenes of Demosthenes's, 
<A NAME="71"></A>Pompey and young Caesar of Cicero's, as the latter himself admits in his 
<A NAME="72"></A>Memoirs addressed to Agrippa and Maecenas. But what are thought and commonly 
<A NAME="73"></A>said most to demonstrate and try the tempers of men, namely, authority 
<A NAME="74"></A>and place, by moving every passion, and discovering every frailty, these 
<A NAME="75"></A>are things which Demosthenes never received; nor was he ever in a position 
<A NAME="76"></A>to give such proof of himself, having never obtained any eminent office, 
<A NAME="77"></A>nor led any of those armies into the field against Philip which he raised 
<A NAME="78"></A>by his eloquence. Cicero, on the other hand, was sent quaestor into Sicily, 
<A NAME="79"></A>and proconsul into Cilicia and Cappadocia, at a time when avarice was at 
<A NAME="80"></A>the height, and the commanders and governors who were employed abroad, 
<A NAME="81"></A>as though they thought it a mean thing to steal, set themselves to seize 
<A NAME="82"></A>by open force; so that it seemed no heinous matter to take bribes, but 
<A NAME="83"></A>he that did it most moderately was in good esteem. And yet he, at this 
<A NAME="84"></A>time, gave the most abundant proofs alike of his contempt of riches and 
<A NAME="85"></A>of his humanity and good-nature. And at Rome, when he was created consul 
<A NAME="86"></A>in name, but indeed received sovereign and dictatorial authority against 
<A NAME="87"></A>Catiline and his conspirators, he attested the truth of Plato's prediction, 
<A NAME="88"></A>that then the miseries of states would be at an end when, by a happy fortune, 
<A NAME="89"></A>supreme power, wisdom, and justice should be united in 
<A NAME="90"></A>one.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR>It is said, to the reproach of Demosthenes, that his eloquence 
<A NAME="92"></A>was mercenary that he privately made orations for Phormion and Apollodorus, 
<A NAME="93"></A>though adversaries in the same cause; that he was charged with moneys received 
<A NAME="94"></A>from the King of Persia, and condemned for bribes from Harpalus. And should 
<A NAME="95"></A>we grant that all those (and they are not few) who have made these statements 
<A NAME="96"></A>against him have spoken what is untrue, yet that Demosthenes was not the 
<A NAME="97"></A>character to look without desire on the presents offered him out of respect 
<A NAME="98"></A>and gratitude by royal persons, and that one who lent money on maritime 
<A NAME="99"></A>usury was likely to be thus indifferent, is what we cannot assert. But 
<A NAME="100"></A>that Cicero refused, from the Sicilians when he was quaestor, from the 
<A NAME="101"></A>King of Cappadocia when he was proconsul, and from his friends at Rome 
<A NAME="102"></A>when he was in exile, many presents, though urged to receive them, has 
<A NAME="103"></A>been said already.
<A NAME="104"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, Demosthenes's banishment was infamous, upon conviction 
<A NAME="105"></A>for bribery; Cicero's very honourable, for ridding his country of a set 
<A NAME="106"></A>of villains. Therefore, when Demosthenes fled his country, no man regarded 
<A NAME="107"></A>it; for Cicero's sake the senate changed their habit, and put on mourning, 
<A NAME="108"></A>and would not be persuaded to make any act before Cicero's return was decreed. 
<A NAME="109"></A>Cicero, however, passed his exile idly in Macedonia. But the very exile 
<A NAME="110"></A>of Demosthenes made up a great part of the services he did for his country; 
<A NAME="111"></A>for he went through the cities of Greece, and everywhere, as we have said, 
<A NAME="112"></A>joined in the conflict on behalf of the Grecians, driving out the Macedonian 
<A NAME="113"></A>ambassadors, and approving himself a much better citizen than Themistocles 
<A NAME="114"></A>and Alcibiades did in the like fortune. And, after his return, he again 
<A NAME="115"></A>devoted himself to the same public service, and continued firm to his opposition 
<A NAME="116"></A>to Antipater and the Macedonians. Whereas Laelius reproached Cicero in 
<A NAME="117"></A>the senate for sitting silent when Caesar, a beardless youth, asked leave 
<A NAME="118"></A>to come forward, contrary to the law, as a candidate for the consulship; 
<A NAME="119"></A>and Brutus, in his epistles, charges him with nursing and rearing a greater 
<A NAME="120"></A>and more heavy tyranny than that they had removed.
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR>Finally, Cicero's death excites our pity; for an old man to be 
<A NAME="122"></A>miserably carried up and down by his servants, flying and hiding himself 
<A NAME="123"></A>from that death which was, in the course of nature, so near at hand; and 
<A NAME="124"></A>yet at last to be murdered. Demosthenes, though he seemed at first a little 
<A NAME="125"></A>to supplicate, yet, by his preparing and keeping the poison by him, demands 
<A NAME="126"></A>our admiration; and still more admirable was his using it. When the temple 
<A NAME="127"></A>of the god no longer afforded him a sanctuary, he took refuge, as it were, 
<A NAME="128"></A>at a mightier altar, freeing himself from arms and soldiers, and laughing 
<A NAME="129"></A>to scorn the cruelty of Antipater.
