<A NAME="2"></A>
<BR>(legendary, died 56 B.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>The grandfather of Lucullus had been consul; his uncle by the mother's 
<A NAME="11"></A>side was Metellus, surnamed Numidicus. As for his parents, his father was 
<A NAME="12"></A>convicted of extortion, and his mother Caecilia's reputation was bad. The 
<A NAME="13"></A>first thing that Lucullus did before ever he stood for any office, or meddled 
<A NAME="14"></A>with the affairs of state, being then but a youth, was to accuse the accuser 
<A NAME="15"></A>of his father, Servilius the augur, having caught him in offence against 
<A NAME="16"></A>the state. This thing was much taken notice of among the Romans, who commended 
<A NAME="17"></A>it as an act of high merit. Even without the provocation the accusation 
<A NAME="18"></A>was esteemed no unbecoming action, for they delighted to see young men 
<A NAME="19"></A>as eagerly attacking injustice as good dogs do wild beasts. But when great 
<A NAME="20"></A>animosities ensued, insomuch that some were wounded and killed in the fray, 
<A NAME="21"></A>Servilius escaped. Lucullus followed his studies and became a competent 
<A NAME="22"></A>speaker, in both Greek and Latin, insomuch that Sylla, when composing the 
<A NAME="23"></A>commentaries of his own life and actions, dedicated them to him, as one 
<A NAME="24"></A>who could have performed the task better himself. His speech was not only 
<A NAME="25"></A>elegant and ready for purposes of mere business, like the ordinary oratory 
<A NAME="26"></A>which will in the public market-place-
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR>"Lash as a wounded tunny does the sea," but on every other occasion 
<A NAME="28"></A>shows itself-
<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR>"Dried up and perished with the want of wit;" but even in his younger 
<A NAME="30"></A>days he addicted himself to the study, simply for its own sake, of the 
<A NAME="31"></A>liberal arts; and when advanced in years, after a life of conflicts, he 
<A NAME="32"></A>gave his mind, as it were, its liberty, to enjoy in full leisure the refreshment 
<A NAME="33"></A>of philosophy; and summoning up his contemplative faculties, administered 
<A NAME="34"></A>a timely check, after his difference with Pompey, to his feelings of emulation 
<A NAME="35"></A>and ambition. Besides what has been said of his love of learning already, 
<A NAME="36"></A>one instance more was, that in his youth, upon a suggestion of writing 
<A NAME="37"></A>the Marsian war in Greek and Latin verse and prose, arising out of some 
<A NAME="38"></A>pleasantry that passed into a serious proposal, he agreed with Hortensius 
<A NAME="39"></A>the lawyer and Sisenna the historian, that he would take his lot; and it 
<A NAME="40"></A>seems that the lot directed him to the Greek tongue, for a Greek history 
<A NAME="41"></A>of that war is still extant.
<A NAME="42"></A><BR><BR>Among the many signs of the great love which he bore to his brother 
<A NAME="43"></A>Marcus, one in particular is commemorated by the Romans. Though he was 
<A NAME="44"></A>elder brother, he would not step into authority without him, but deferred 
<A NAME="45"></A>his own advance until his brother was qualified to bear a share with him, 
<A NAME="46"></A>and so won upon the people as, when absent, to be chosen Aedile with 
<A NAME="47"></A>him.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>He gave many and early proofs of his valour and conduct in the 
<A NAME="49"></A>Marsian war, and was admired by Sylla for his constancy and mildness, and 
<A NAME="50"></A>always employed in affairs of importance, especially in the mint; most 
<A NAME="51"></A>of the money for carrying on the Mithridatic war being coined by him in 
<A NAME="52"></A>Peloponnesus, which, by the soldiers' wants, was brought into rapid circulation 
<A NAME="53"></A>and long continued current under the name of Lucullean coin. After this, 
<A NAME="54"></A>when Sylla conquered Athens, and was victorious by land but found the supplies 
<A NAME="55"></A>for his army cut off, the enemy being master at sea, Lucullus was the man 
<A NAME="56"></A>whom he sent into Libya and Egypt to procure him shipping. It was the depth 
<A NAME="57"></A>of winter when he ventured with but three small Greek vessels, and as many 
<A NAME="58"></A>Rhodian galleys, not only into the main sea, but also among multitudes 
<A NAME="59"></A>of vessels belonging to the enemies who were cruising about as absolute 
<A NAME="60"></A>masters. Arriving at Crete he gained it, and finding the Cyrenians harassed 
<A NAME="61"></A>by long tyrannies and wars, he composed their troubles, and settled their 
<A NAME="62"></A>government; putting the city in mind of that saying which Plato once had 
<A NAME="63"></A>oracularly uttered of them, who, being requested to prescribe laws to them, 
<A NAME="64"></A>and mould them into some sound form of government, made answer that it 
<A NAME="65"></A>was a hard thing to give laws to the Cyrenians, abounding, as they did, 
<A NAME="66"></A>in wealth and plenty. For nothing is more intractable than man when in 
<A NAME="67"></A>felicity, nor anything more docile, when he has been reduced and humbled 
<A NAME="68"></A>by fortune. This made the Cyrenians so willingly submit to the laws which 
<A NAME="69"></A>Lucullus imposed upon them. From thence sailing into Egypt, and pressed 
<A NAME="70"></A>by pirates, he lost most of his vessels; but he himself narrowly escaping, 
<A NAME="71"></A>made a magnificent entry into Alexandria. The whole fleet, a compliment 
<A NAME="72"></A>due only to royalty, met him in full array, and the young Ptolemy showed 
<A NAME="73"></A>wonderful kindness to him, appointing him lodging and diet in the palace, 
<A NAME="74"></A>where no foreign commander before him had been received. Besides, he gave 
<A NAME="75"></A>him gratuities and presents, not such as were usually given to men of his 
<A NAME="76"></A>condition, but four times as much; of which, however, he took nothing more 
<A NAME="77"></A>than served his necessity and accepted of no gift, though what was worth 
<A NAME="78"></A>eighty talents was offered him. It is reported he neither went to see Memphis, 
<A NAME="79"></A>nor any of the celebrated wonders of Egypt. It was for a man of no business 
<A NAME="80"></A>and much curiosity to see such things, not for him who had left his commander 
<A NAME="81"></A>in the field lodging under the ramparts of his enemies.
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR>Ptolemy, fearing the issue of that war, deserted the confederacy, 
<A NAME="83"></A>but nevertheless sent a convoy with him as far as Cyprus, and at parting, 
<A NAME="84"></A>with much ceremony, wishing him a good voyage, gave him a very precious 
<A NAME="85"></A>emerald set in gold. Lucullus at first refused it, but when the king showed 
<A NAME="86"></A>him his own likeness cut upon it, he thought he could not persist in a 
<A NAME="87"></A>denial, for had he parted with such open offence, it might have endangered 
<A NAME="88"></A>his passage. Drawing a considerable squadron together, which he summoned 
<A NAME="89"></A>as he sailed by out of all the maritime towns except those suspected of 
<A NAME="90"></A>piracy, he sailed for Cyprus, and there understanding that the enemy lay 
<A NAME="91"></A>in wait under the promontories for him, he laid up his fleet, and sent 
<A NAME="92"></A>to the cities to send in provisions for his wintering among them. But when 
<A NAME="93"></A>time served, he launched his ships suddenly, and went off and hoisting 
<A NAME="94"></A>all his sails in the night, while he kept them down in the day, thus came 
<A NAME="95"></A>safe to Rhodes. Being furnished with ships at Rhodes, he also prevailed 
<A NAME="96"></A>upon the inhabitants of Cos and Cnidus to leave the king's side, and join 
<A NAME="97"></A>in an expedition against the Samians. Out of Chios he himself drove the 
<A NAME="98"></A>king's party, and set the Colophonians at liberty, having seized Epigonus 
<A NAME="99"></A>the tyrant, who oppressed them.
<A NAME="100"></A><BR><BR>About this time Mithridates left Pergamus, and retired to Pitane, 
<A NAME="101"></A>where being closely besieged by Fimbria on the land. and not daring to 
<A NAME="102"></A>engage with so bold and victorious a commander, he was concerting means 
<A NAME="103"></A>for escape by sea, and sent for all his fleets from every quarter to attend 
<A NAME="104"></A>him. Which when Fimbria perceived, having no ships of his own, he sent 
<A NAME="105"></A>to Lucullus, entreating him to assist him with his, in subduing the most 
<A NAME="106"></A>odious and warlike of kings, lest the opportunity of humbling Mithridates, 
<A NAME="107"></A>the prize which the Romans had pursued with so much blood and trouble, 
<A NAME="108"></A>should now at last be lost, when he was within the net and easily to be 
<A NAME="109"></A>taken. And were he caught, no one would be more highly commended than Lucullus, 
<A NAME="110"></A>who stopped his passage and seized him in his flight. Being driven from 
<A NAME="111"></A>the land by the one, and met in the sea by the other, he would give matter 
<A NAME="112"></A>of renown and glory to them both, and the much applauded actions of Sylla 
<A NAME="113"></A>at Orchomenus and about Chaeronea would no longer be thought of by the 
<A NAME="114"></A>Romans. The proposal was no unreasonable thing; it being obvious to all 
<A NAME="115"></A>men, that if Lucullus had hearkened to Fimbria, and with his navy, which 
<A NAME="116"></A>was then near at hand, had blocked up the haven, the war soon had been 
<A NAME="117"></A>brought to an end, and infinite numbers of mischiefs prevented thereby. 
<A NAME="118"></A>But he, whether from the sacredness of friendship between himself and Sylla, 
<A NAME="119"></A>reckoning all other considerations of public or of private advantage inferior 
<A NAME="120"></A>to it, or out of detestation of the wickedness of Fimbria, whom he abhorred 
<A NAME="121"></A>for advancing himself by the late death of his friend and the general of 
<A NAME="122"></A>the army, or by a divine fortune sparing Mithridates then, that he might 
<A NAME="123"></A>have him an adversary for a time to come, for whatever reason, refused 
<A NAME="124"></A>to comply, and suffered Mithridates to escape and laugh at the attempts 
<A NAME="125"></A>of Fimbria. He himself alone first, near Lectum, in Troas, in a sea-fight, 
<A NAME="126"></A>overcame the king's ships; and afterwards, discovering Neoptolemus lying 
<A NAME="127"></A>in wait for him near Tenedos, with a greater fleet, he went aboard a Rhodian 
<A NAME="128"></A>quinquereme galley, commanded by Damagoras, a man of great experience at 
<A NAME="129"></A>sea, and friendly to the Romans, and sailed before the rest. Neoptolemus 
<A NAME="130"></A>made up furiously at him, and commanded the master, with all imaginable 
<A NAME="131"></A>might, to charge; but Damagoras, fearing the bulk and massy stem of the 
<A NAME="132"></A>admiral, thought it dangerous to meet him prow to prow, and, rapidly wheeling 
<A NAME="133"></A>round, bid his men back water, and so received him astern; in which place, 
<A NAME="134"></A>though violently borne upon, he received no manner of harm, the blow being 
<A NAME="135"></A>defeated by falling on those parts of the ship which lay under water. By 
<A NAME="136"></A>which time, the rest of the fleet coming up to him, Lucullus gave order 
<A NAME="137"></A>to turn again, and vigorously falling upon the enemy, put them to flight, 
<A NAME="138"></A>and pursued Neoptolemus. After this he came to Sylla, in Chersonesus, as 
<A NAME="139"></A>he was preparing to pass the strait, and brought timely assistance for 
<A NAME="140"></A>the safe transportation of the army.
<A NAME="141"></A><BR><BR>Peace being presently made, Mithridates sailed off to the Euxine 
<A NAME="142"></A>sea, but Sylla taxed the inhabitants of Asia twenty thousand talents, and 
<A NAME="143"></A>ordered Lucullus to gather and coin the money. And it was no small comfort 
<A NAME="144"></A>to the cities under Sylla's severity, that a man of not only incorrupt 
<A NAME="145"></A>and just behaviour, but also of moderation, should be employed in so heavy 
<A NAME="146"></A>and odious an office. The Mitylenaeans, who absolutely revolted, he was 
<A NAME="147"></A>willing should return to their duty, and submit to a moderate penalty for 
<A NAME="148"></A>the offence they had given in the case of Marius. But finding them bent 
<A NAME="149"></A>upon their own destruction, he came up to them, defeated them at sea, blocked 
<A NAME="150"></A>them up in their city and besieged them; then sailing off from them openly 
<A NAME="151"></A>in the day to Elaea, he returned privately, and posting an ambush near 
<A NAME="152"></A>the city, lay quiet himself. And on the Mitylenaeans coming out eagerly 
<A NAME="153"></A>and in disorder to plunder the deserted camp, he fell upon them, took many 
<A NAME="154"></A>of them, and slew five hundred, who stood upon their defence. He gained 
<A NAME="155"></A>six thousand slaves and a very rich booty.
<A NAME="156"></A><BR><BR>He was no way engaged in the great and general troubles of Italy 
<A NAME="157"></A>which Sylla and Marius created, a happy providence at that time detaining 
<A NAME="158"></A>him in Asia upon business. He was as much in Sylla's favour, however, as 
<A NAME="159"></A>any of his other friends; Sylla, as was said before, dedicated his Memoirs 
<A NAME="160"></A>to him as a token of kindness, and at his death, passing by Pompey, made 
<A NAME="161"></A>him guardian to his son; which seems, indeed, to have been the rise of 
<A NAME="162"></A>the quarrel and jealousy between them two, being both young men, and passionate 
<A NAME="163"></A>for honour.
<A NAME="164"></A><BR><BR>A little after Sylla's death, he was made consul with Marcus Cotta, 
<A NAME="165"></A>about the one hundred and seventy-sixth Olympiad. The Mithridatic war being 
<A NAME="166"></A>then under debate, Marcus declared that it was not finished, but only respited 
<A NAME="167"></A>for a time, and therefore, upon choice of provinces, the lot falling to 
<A NAME="168"></A>Lucullus to have Gaul within the Alps, a province where no great action 
<A NAME="169"></A>was to be done, he was ill-pleased. But chiefly, the success of Pompey 
<A NAME="170"></A>in Spain fretted him, as, with the renown he got there, if the Spanish 
<A NAME="171"></A>war were finished in time, he was likely to be chosen general before any 
<A NAME="172"></A>one else against Mithridates. So that when Pompey sent for money, and signified 
<A NAME="173"></A>by letter that, unless it were sent him, he would leave the country and 
<A NAME="174"></A>Sertorius, and bring his forces home to Italy, Lucullus most zealously 
<A NAME="175"></A>supported his request, to prevent any pretence of his returning home during 
<A NAME="176"></A>his own consulship; for all things would have been at his disposal, at 
<A NAME="177"></A>the head of so great an army. For Cethegus, the most influential popular 
<A NAME="178"></A>leader at that time, owing to his always both acting and speaking to please 
<A NAME="179"></A>the people, had, as it happened, a hatred to Lucullus, who had not concealed 
<A NAME="180"></A>his disgust at his debauched, insolent, and lawless life. Lucullus, therefore, 
<A NAME="181"></A>was at open warfare with him. And Lucius Quintius, also, another demagogue, 
<A NAME="182"></A>who was taking steps against Sylla's constitution, and endeavouring to 
<A NAME="183"></A>put things out of order, by private exhortations and public admonitions 
<A NAME="184"></A>he checked in his designs, and repressed his ambition, wisely and safely 
<A NAME="185"></A>remedying a great evil at the very outset.
<A NAME="186"></A><BR><BR>At this time news came that Octavius, the governor of Cilicia, 
<A NAME="187"></A>was dead, and many were eager for the place, courting Cethegus, as the 
<A NAME="188"></A>man best able to serve them. Lucullus set little value upon Cilicia itself, 
<A NAME="189"></A>no otherwise than as he thought, by his acceptance of it, no other man 
<A NAME="190"></A>besides himself might be employed in the war against Mithridates, by reason 
<A NAME="191"></A>of its nearness to Cappadocia. This made him strain every effort that that 
<A NAME="192"></A>province might be allotted to himself, and to none other; which led him 
<A NAME="193"></A>at last into an expedient not so honest or commendable, as it was serviceable 
<A NAME="194"></A>for compassing his design, submitting to necessity against his own inclination. 
<A NAME="195"></A>There was one Praecia, a celebrated wit and beauty, but in other respects 
<A NAME="196"></A>nothing better than an ordinary harlot; who, however, to the charms of 
<A NAME="197"></A>her person adding the reputation of one that loved and served her friends, 
<A NAME="198"></A>by making use of those who visited her to assist their designs and promote 
<A NAME="199"></A>their interests, had thus gained great power. She had seduced Cethegus, 
<A NAME="200"></A>the first man at that time in reputation and authority of all the city, 
<A NAME="201"></A>and enticed him to her love, and so had made all authority follow her. 
<A NAME="202"></A>For nothing of moment was done in which Cethegus was not concerned, and 
<A NAME="203"></A>nothing by Cethegus without Praecia. This woman Lucullus gained to his 
<A NAME="204"></A>side by gifts and flattery (and a great price it was in itself to so stately 
<A NAME="205"></A>and magnificent a dame, to be seen engaged in the same cause with Lucullus), 
<A NAME="206"></A>and thus he presently found Cethegus his friend, using his utmost interest 
<A NAME="207"></A>to procure Cilicia for him; which when once obtained, there was no more 
<A NAME="208"></A>need of applying himself either of Praecia or Cethegus; for all unanimously 
<A NAME="209"></A>voted him to the Mithridatic war, by no hands likely to be so successfully 
<A NAME="210"></A>managed as his. Pompey was still contending with Sertorius, and Metellus 
<A NAME="211"></A>by age unfit for service; which two alone were the competitors who could 
<A NAME="212"></A>prefer any claim with Lucullus for that command. Cotta, his colleague, 
<A NAME="213"></A>after much ado in the senate, was sent away with a fleet to guard the Propontis, 
<A NAME="214"></A>and defend Bithynia.
<A NAME="215"></A><BR><BR>Lucullus carried with him a legion under his own orders, and crossed 
<A NAME="216"></A>over into Asia and took the command of the forces there, composed of men 
<A NAME="217"></A>who were all thoroughly disabled by dissoluteness and rapine, and the Fimbrians, 
<A NAME="218"></A>as they were called, utterly unmanageable by long want of any sort of discipline. 
<A NAME="219"></A>For these were they who under Fimbria had slain Flaccus, the consul and 
<A NAME="220"></A>general, and afterwards betrayed Fimbria to Sylla; a willful and lawless 
<A NAME="221"></A>set of men, but warlike, expert and hardy in the field. Lucullus in a short 
<A NAME="222"></A>time took down the courage of these, and disciplined the others, who then 
<A NAME="223"></A>first, in all probability, knew what a true commander and governor was; 
<A NAME="224"></A>whereas in former times they had been courted to service, and took up arms 
<A NAME="225"></A>at nobody's command, but their own wills.
<A NAME="226"></A><BR><BR>The enemy's provisions for war stood thus: Mithridates, like the 
<A NAME="227"></A>Sophists, boastful and haughty at first, set upon the Romans, with a very 
<A NAME="228"></A>inefficient army, such, indeed, as made a good show, but was nothing for 
<A NAME="229"></A>use; but being shamefully routed, and taught a lesson for a second engagement, 
<A NAME="230"></A>he reduced his forces to a proper, serviceable shape. Dispensing with the 
<A NAME="231"></A>mixed multitudes, and the noisy menaces of barbarous tribes of various 
<A NAME="232"></A>languages, and with the ornaments of gold and precious stones, a greater 
<A NAME="233"></A>temptation to the victors than security to the bearers, he gave his men 
<A NAME="234"></A>broad swords like the Romans', and massy shields; chose horses better for 
<A NAME="235"></A>service than show, drew up an hundred and twenty thousand foot in the figure 
<A NAME="236"></A>of the Roman phalanx, and had sixteen thousand horse, besides chariots 
<A NAME="237"></A>armed with scythes, no less than a hundred. Besides which, he set out a 
<A NAME="238"></A>fleet not at all cumbered with gilded cabins, luxurious baths, and women's 
<A NAME="239"></A>furniture, but stored with weapons and darts, and other necessaries, and 
<A NAME="240"></A>thus made a descent upon Bithynia. Not only did these parts willingly receive 
<A NAME="241"></A>him again, but almost all Asia regarded him as their salvation from the 
<A NAME="242"></A>intolerable miseries which they were suffering from the Roman money-lenders 
<A NAME="243"></A>and revenue farmers. These, afterwards, who like harpies stole away their 
<A NAME="244"></A>very nourishment, Lucullus drove away, and at this time, by reproving them, 
<A NAME="245"></A>did what he could to make them more moderate, and to prevent a general 
<A NAME="246"></A>secession, then breaking out in all parts. While Lucullus was detained 
<A NAME="247"></A>in rectifying these matters, Cotta, finding affairs ripe for action, prepared 
<A NAME="248"></A>for battle with Mithridates; and news coming from all hands that Lucullus 
<A NAME="249"></A>had already entered Phrygia, on his march against the enemy, he, thinking 
<A NAME="250"></A>he had a triumph all but actually in his hands, lest his colleague should 
<A NAME="251"></A>share in the glory of it, hasted to battle without him. But being routed, 
<A NAME="252"></A>both by sea and land, he lost sixty ships with their men, and four thousand 
<A NAME="253"></A>foot, and himself was forced into and besieged in Chalcedon, there waiting 
<A NAME="254"></A>for relief from Lucullus. There were those about Lucullus who would have 
<A NAME="255"></A>had him leave Cotta, and go forward, in hope of surprising the defenceless 
<A NAME="256"></A>kingdom of Mithridates. And this was the feeling of the soldiers in general, 
<A NAME="257"></A>who were indignant that Cotta should by his ill-counsel not only lose his 
<A NAME="258"></A>own army, but hinder them also from conquest, which at that time, without 
<A NAME="259"></A>the hazard of a battle, they might have obtained. But Lucullus, in a public 
<A NAME="260"></A>address, declared to them that he would rather save one citizen from the 
<A NAME="261"></A>enemy, than be master of all that they had.
<A NAME="262"></A><BR><BR>Archelaus, the former commander in Boeotia under Mithridates, who 
<A NAME="263"></A>afterwards deserted him and accompanied the Romans, protested to Lucullus 
<A NAME="264"></A>that, upon his bare coming, he would possess himself of all Pontus. But 
<A NAME="265"></A>he answered, that it did not become him to be more cowardly than huntsmen, 
<A NAME="266"></A>to leave the wild beasts abroad and seek after sport in their deserted 
<A NAME="267"></A>dens. Having so said, he made towards Mithridates with thirty thousand 
<A NAME="268"></A>foot and two thousand five hundred horse. But on being come in sight of 
<A NAME="269"></A>his enemies, he was astonished at their numbers, and thought to forbear 
<A NAME="270"></A>fighting, and wear out time. But Marius, whom Sertorius had sent out of 
<A NAME="271"></A>Spain to Mithridates with forces under him, stepping out and challenging 
<A NAME="272"></A>him, he prepared for battle. In the very instant before joining battle, 
<A NAME="273"></A>without any perceptible alteration preceding, on a sudden the sky opened, 
<A NAME="274"></A>and a large luminous body fell down in the midst between the armies, in 
<A NAME="275"></A>shape like a hogshead, but in colour like melted silver, insomuch that 
<A NAME="276"></A>both armies in alarm withdrew. This wonderful prodigy happened in Phrygia, 
<A NAME="277"></A>near Otryae. Lucullus after this began to think with himself that no human 
<A NAME="278"></A>power and wealth could suffice to sustain such great numbers as Mithridates 
<A NAME="279"></A>had for any long time in the face of an enemy, and commanded one of the 
<A NAME="280"></A>captives to be brought before him, and first of all asked him how many 
<A NAME="281"></A>companions had been quartered with him and how much provision he had left 
<A NAME="282"></A>behind him, and when he had answered him, commanded him to stand aside; 
<A NAME="283"></A>then asked a second and a third the same question; after which, comparing 
<A NAME="284"></A>the quantity of provision with the men, he found that in three or four 
<A NAME="285"></A>days' time his enemies would be brought to want. This all the more determined 
<A NAME="286"></A>him to trust to time, and he took measures to store his camp with all sorts 
<A NAME="287"></A>of provision, and thus living in plenty, trusted to watch the necessities 
<A NAME="288"></A>of his hungry enemy.
<A NAME="289"></A><BR><BR>This made Mithridates set out against the Cyzicenians, miserably 
<A NAME="290"></A>shattered in the fight at Chalcedon, where they lost no less than three 
<A NAME="291"></A>thousand citizens and ten ships. And that he might the safer steal away 
<A NAME="292"></A>unobserved by Lucullus, immediately after supper, by the help of a dark 
<A NAME="293"></A>and wet night, he went off, and by the morning gained the neighbourhood 
<A NAME="294"></A>of the city, and sat down with his forces upon the Adrastean mount. Lucullus, 
<A NAME="295"></A>on finding him gone, pursued, but was well pleased not to over-take him 
<A NAME="296"></A>with his own forces in disorder; and he sat down near what is called the 
<A NAME="297"></A>Thracian village, an admirable position for commanding all the roads and 
<A NAME="298"></A>the places whence, and through which, the provisions for Mithridates's 
<A NAME="299"></A>camp must of necessity come. And judging now of the event, he no longer 
<A NAME="300"></A>kept his mind from his soldiers, but when the camp was fortified and their 
<A NAME="301"></A>work finished, called them together, and with great assurance told them 
<A NAME="302"></A>that in a few days, without the expense of blood, he would give them 
<A NAME="303"></A>victory.
<A NAME="304"></A><BR><BR>Mithridates besieged the Cyzicenians with ten camps by land, and 
<A NAME="305"></A>with his ships occupied the strait that was betwixt their city and the 
<A NAME="306"></A>mainland, and so blocked them up on all sides; they, however, were fully 
<A NAME="307"></A>prepared stoutly to receive him, and resolved to endure the utmost extremity, 
<A NAME="308"></A>rather than forsake the Romans. That which troubled them most was, that 
<A NAME="309"></A>they knew not where Lucullus was, and heard nothing of him, though at that 
<A NAME="310"></A>time his army was visible before them. But they were imposed upon by the 
<A NAME="311"></A>Mithridatians, who, showing them the Romans encamped on the hills, said, 
<A NAME="312"></A>"Do you see those? those are the auxiliary Armenians and Medes, whom Tigranes 
<A NAME="313"></A>has sent to Mithridates." They were thus overwhelmed with thinking of the 
<A NAME="314"></A>vast numbers round them, and could not believe any way of relief was left 
<A NAME="315"></A>them, even if Lucullus should come up to their assistance. Demonax, a messenger 
<A NAME="316"></A>sent in by Archelaus, was the first who told them of Lucullus's arrival; 
<A NAME="317"></A>but they disbelieved his report, and thought he came with a story invented 
<A NAME="318"></A>merely to encourage them. At which time it happened that a boy, a prisoner 
<A NAME="319"></A>who had run away from the enemy, was brought before them; who, being asked 
<A NAME="320"></A>where Lucullus was, laughed at their jesting, as he thought, but, finding 
<A NAME="321"></A>them in earnest, with his finger pointed to the Roman camp; upon which 
<A NAME="322"></A>they took courage. The lake Dascylitis was navigated with vessels of some 
<A NAME="323"></A>little size; one, the biggest of them, Lucullus drew ashore, and carrying 
<A NAME="324"></A>her across in a wagon to the sea, filled her with soldiers, who, sailing 
<A NAME="325"></A>along unseen in the dead of the night, came safe into the 
<A NAME="326"></A>city.
<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR>The gods themselves, too, in admiration of the constancy of the 
<A NAME="328"></A>Cyzicenians, seem to have animated them with manifest signs, more especially 
<A NAME="329"></A>now in the festival of Proserpine, where a black heifer being wanting for 
<A NAME="330"></A>sacrifice, they supplied it by a figure made of dough, which they set before 
<A NAME="331"></A>the altar. But the holy heifer set apart for the goddess, and at that time 
<A NAME="332"></A>grazing with the other herds of the Cyzicenians, on the other side of the 
<A NAME="333"></A>strait, left the herd and swam over to the city alone, and offered herself 
<A NAME="334"></A>for sacrifice. By night, also, the goddess appearing to Aristagoras, the 
<A NAME="335"></A>town clerk, "I am come," said she, "and have brought the Libyan piper against 
<A NAME="336"></A>the Pontic trumpeter; bid the citizens, therefore, be of good courage." 
<A NAME="337"></A>While the Cyzicenians were wondering what the words could mean, a sudden 
<A NAME="338"></A>wind sprung up and caused a considerable motion on the sea. The king's 
<A NAME="339"></A>battering engines, the wonderful contrivance of Niconides of Thessaly, 
<A NAME="340"></A>then under the walls, by their cracking and rattling soon demonstrated 
<A NAME="341"></A>what would follow; after which an extraordinarily tempestuous south wind 
<A NAME="342"></A>succeeding shattered, in a short space of time, all the rest of the works, 
<A NAME="343"></A>and, by a violent concussion, threw down the wooden tower a hundred cubits 
<A NAME="344"></A>high. It is said that in Ilium Minerva appeared to many that night in their 
<A NAME="345"></A>sleep, with the sweat running down her person, and showed them her robe 
<A NAME="346"></A>torn in one place, telling them that she had just arrived from relieving 
<A NAME="347"></A>the Cyzicenians; and the inhabitants to this day show a monument, with 
<A NAME="348"></A>an inscription, including a public decree, referring to the 
<A NAME="349"></A>fact.
<A NAME="350"></A><BR><BR>Mithridates, through the knavery of his officers, not knowing for 
<A NAME="351"></A>some time the want of provision in his camp, was troubled in mind that 
<A NAME="352"></A>the Cyzicenians should hold out against him. But his ambition and anger 
<A NAME="353"></A>fell, when he saw his soldiers in the extremity of want, and feeding on 
<A NAME="354"></A>men's flesh; as, in truth, Lucullus was not carrying on the war as mere 
<A NAME="355"></A>matter of show and stage-play, but, according to the proverb, made the 
<A NAME="356"></A>seat of war in the belly, and did everything to cut off their supplies 
<A NAME="357"></A>of food. Mithridates, therefore, took advantage of the time while Lucullus 
<A NAME="358"></A>was storming a fort, and sent away almost all his horse to Bithynia, with 
<A NAME="359"></A>the sumpter cattle, and as many of the foot as were unfit for service. 
<A NAME="360"></A>On intelligence of which, Lucullus, while it was yet night, came to his 
<A NAME="361"></A>camp, and in the morning, though it was stormy weather, took with him ten 
<A NAME="362"></A>cohorts of foot, and the horse, and pursued them under falling snow and 
<A NAME="363"></A>in cold so severe that many of his soldiers were unable to proceed; and 
<A NAME="364"></A>with the rest coming upon the enemy, near the river Rhyndacus, he overthrew 
<A NAME="365"></A>them with so great a slaughter that the very women of Apollonia came out 
<A NAME="366"></A>to seize on the booty and strip the slain. Great numbers, as we may suppose, 
<A NAME="367"></A>were slain; six thousand horses were taken, with an infinite number of 
<A NAME="368"></A>beasts of burden, and no less than fifteen thousand men. All which he led 
<A NAME="369"></A>along by the enemy's camp. I cannot but wonder on this occasion at Sallust, 
<A NAME="370"></A>who says that this was the first time camels were seen by the Romans, as 
<A NAME="371"></A>if he thought those who, long before, under Scipio defeated Antiochus, 
<A NAME="372"></A>or those who lately had fought against Archelaus near Orchomenus and Chaeronea, 
<A NAME="373"></A>had not known what a camel was. Mithridates himself, fully determined upon 
<A NAME="374"></A>flight, as mere delays and diversions for Lucullus, sent his admiral Aristonicus 
<A NAME="375"></A>to the Greek sea; who, however, was betrayed in the very instant of going 
<A NAME="376"></A>off, and Lucullus became master of him, and ten thousand pieces of gold 
<A NAME="377"></A>which he was carrying with him to corrupt some of the Roman army. After 
<A NAME="378"></A>which, Mithridates himself made for the sea, leaving the foot officers 
<A NAME="379"></A>to conduct the army, upon whom Lucullus fell, near the river Granicus, 
<A NAME="380"></A>where he took a vast number alive, and slew twenty thousand. It is reported 
<A NAME="381"></A>that the total number killed, of fighting men and of others who followed 
<A NAME="382"></A>the camp, amounted to something not far short of three hundred 
<A NAME="383"></A>thousand.
<A NAME="384"></A><BR><BR>Lucullus first went to Cyzicus, where he was received with all 
<A NAME="385"></A>the joy and gratitude suiting the occasion, and then collected a navy, 
<A NAME="386"></A>visiting the shores of the Hellespont. And arriving at Troas, he lodged 
<A NAME="387"></A>in the temple of Venus, where, in the night, he thought he saw the goddess 
<A NAME="388"></A>coming to him, and saying-
<A NAME="389"></A><BR><BR>"Sleep'st thou, great lion, when the fawns are nigh?" Rising up 
<A NAME="390"></A>hereupon, he called his friends to him, it being yet night, and told them 
<A NAME="391"></A>his vision; at which instant some Ilians came up and acquainted him that 
<A NAME="392"></A>thirteen of the king's quinqueremes were seen off the Achaean harbour, 
<A NAME="393"></A>sailing for Lemnos. He at once put to sea, took these, and slew their admiral 
<A NAME="394"></A>Isidorus. And then he made after another squadron, who were just come into 
<A NAME="395"></A>port, and were hauling their vessels ashore, but fought from the decks, 
<A NAME="396"></A>and sorely galled Lucullus's men; there being neither room to sail round 
<A NAME="397"></A>them, nor to bear upon them for any damage, his ships being afloat, while 
<A NAME="398"></A>their stood secure and fixed on the sand. After much ado, at the only landing-place 
<A NAME="399"></A>of the island, he disembarked the choicest of his men, who, falling upon 
<A NAME="400"></A>the enemy behind, killed some, and forced others to cut their cables, and 
<A NAME="401"></A>thus making from the shore, they fell foul upon one another, or came within 
<A NAME="402"></A>the reach of Lucullus's fleet. Many were killed in the action. Among the 
<A NAME="403"></A>captives was Marius, the commander sent by Sertorius, who had but one eye. 
<A NAME="404"></A>And it was Lucullus's strict command to his men before the engagement, 
<A NAME="405"></A>that they should kill no man who had but one eye, that he might rather 
<A NAME="406"></A>die under disgrace and reproach.
<A NAME="407"></A><BR><BR>This being over, he hastened his pursuit after Mithridates, whom 
<A NAME="408"></A>he hoped to still find in Bithynia, intercepted by Voconius, whom he sent 
<A NAME="409"></A>out before to Nicomedia with part of the fleet to stop his flight. But 
<A NAME="410"></A>Voconius, loitering in Samothrace to get initiated and celebrate a feast, 
<A NAME="411"></A>let slip his opportunity, Mithridates being passed by with all his fleet. 
<A NAME="412"></A>He, hastening into Pontus before Lucullus should come up to him, was caught 
<A NAME="413"></A>in a storm, which dispersed his fleet and sunk several ships. The wrecks 
<A NAME="414"></A>floated on all the neighbouring shore for many days after. The merchant 
<A NAME="415"></A>ship, in which he himself was, could not well in that heavy swell be brought 
<A NAME="416"></A>ashore by the masters for its bigness, and it being heavy with water and 
<A NAME="417"></A>ready to sink, he left it and went aboard a pirate vessel, delivering himself 
<A NAME="418"></A>into the hands of pirates, and thus unexpectedly and wonderfully came safe 
<A NAME="419"></A>to Heraclea, in Pontus.
<A NAME="420"></A><BR><BR>Thus the proud language Lucullus had used to the senate ended without 
<A NAME="421"></A>any mischance. For they having decreed him three thousand talents to furnish 
<A NAME="422"></A>out a navy, he himself was against it, and sent them word that without 
<A NAME="423"></A>any such great and costly supplies, by the confederate shipping alone, 
<A NAME="424"></A>he did not in the least doubt but to rout Mithridates from the sea. And 
<A NAME="425"></A>so he did, by divine assistance, for it is said that the wrath of Diana 
<A NAME="426"></A>of Priapus brought the great tempest upon the men of Pontus, because they 
<A NAME="427"></A>had robbed her temple and removed her image.
<A NAME="428"></A><BR><BR>Many were persuading Lucullus to defer the war, but he rejected 
<A NAME="429"></A>their counsel, and marched through Bithynia and Galatia into the king's 
<A NAME="430"></A>country, in such great scarcity of provision at first, that thirty thousand 
<A NAME="431"></A>Galatians followed, every man carrying a bushel of wheat at his back. But 
<A NAME="432"></A>subduing all in his progress before him, he at last found himself in such 
<A NAME="433"></A>great plenty that an ox was sold in the camp for a single drachma, and 
<A NAME="434"></A>a slave for four. The other booty they made no account of, but left it 
<A NAME="435"></A>behind or destroyed it; there being no disposing of it, where all had such 
<A NAME="436"></A>abundance. But when they had made frequent incursions with their cavalry, 
<A NAME="437"></A>and had advanced as far as Themiscyra, and the plains of the Thermodon, 
<A NAME="438"></A>merely laying waste the country before them, they began to find fault with 
<A NAME="439"></A>Lucullus, asking "why he took so many towns by surrender, and never one 
<A NAME="440"></A>by storm, which might enrich them with the plunder? and now, forsooth, 
<A NAME="441"></A>leaving Amisus behind, a rich and wealthy city, of easy conquest, if closely 
<A NAME="442"></A>besieged, he will carry us into the Tibarenian and Chaldean wilderness, 
<A NAME="443"></A>to fight with Mithridates." Lucullus, little thinking this would be of 
<A NAME="444"></A>such dangerous consequence as it afterwards proved, took no notice and 
<A NAME="445"></A>slighted it; and was rather anxious to excuse himself to those who blamed 
<A NAME="446"></A>his tardiness, in losing time about small, pitiful places not worth the 
<A NAME="447"></A>while, and allowing Mithridates opportunity to recruit. "That is what I 
<A NAME="448"></A>design," said he, "and sit here contriving by my delay, that he may grow 
<A NAME="449"></A>great again, and gather a considerable army, which may induce him to stand, 
<A NAME="450"></A>and not fly away before us. For do you not see the wide and unknown wilderness 
<A NAME="451"></A>behind? Caucasus is not far off, and a multitude of vast mountains, enough 
<A NAME="452"></A>to conceal ten thousand kings that wished to avoid a battle. Besides this, 
<A NAME="453"></A>a journey but of few days leads from Cabira to Armenia, where Tigranes 
<A NAME="454"></A>reigns, king of kings, and holds in his hands a power that has enabled 
<A NAME="455"></A>him to keep the Parthians in narrow bounds, to remove Greek cities bodily 
<A NAME="456"></A>into Media, to conquer Syria and Palestine, to put to death the kings of 
<A NAME="457"></A>the royal line of Seleucus, and carry away their wives and daughters by 
<A NAME="458"></A>violence. This same is relation and son-in-law to Mithridates, and cannot 
<A NAME="459"></A>but receive him upon entreaty, and enter into war with us to defend him; 
<A NAME="460"></A>so that, while we endeavour to dispose Mithridates, we shall endanger the 
<A NAME="461"></A>bringing in of Tigranes against us, who already has sought occasion to 
<A NAME="462"></A>fall out with us, but can never find one so justifiable as the succour 
<A NAME="463"></A>of a friend and prince in his necessity. Why, therefore, should we put 
<A NAME="464"></A>Mithridates upon this resource, who as yet does not see how he may best 
<A NAME="465"></A>fight with us, and disdains to stoop to Tigranes; and not rather allow 
<A NAME="466"></A>him time to gather a new army and grow confident again, that we may thus 
<A NAME="467"></A>fight with Colchians and Tibarenians whom we have often defeated already, 
<A NAME="468"></A>and not with Medes and Armenians."
<A NAME="469"></A><BR><BR>Upon these motives, Lucullus sat down before Amisus, and slowly 
<A NAME="470"></A>carried on the siege. But the winter being well spent, he left Murena in 
<A NAME="471"></A>charge of it, and went himself against Mithridates, then rendezvousing 
<A NAME="472"></A>at Cabira, and resolving to await the Romans, with forty thousand foot 
<A NAME="473"></A>about him and fourteen thousand horse, on whom he chiefly confided. Passing 
<A NAME="474"></A>the river Lycus, he challenged the Romans into the plains, where the cavalry 
<A NAME="475"></A>engaged, and the Romans were beaten. Pomponius, a man of some note, was 
<A NAME="476"></A>taken wounded; and sore, and in pain as he was, was carried before Mithridates, 
<A NAME="477"></A>and asked by the king if he would become his friend if he saved his life. 
<A NAME="478"></A>He answered, "Yes, if you become reconciled to the Romans; if not, your 
<A NAME="479"></A>enemy." Mithridates wondered at him, and did him no hurt. The enemy being 
<A NAME="480"></A>with their cavalry master of the plains, Lucullus was something afraid, 
<A NAME="481"></A>and hesitated to enter the mountains, being very large, woody, and almost 
<A NAME="482"></A>inaccessible, when by good-luck, some Greeks who had fled into a cave were 
<A NAME="483"></A>taken, the eldest of whom, Artemidorus by name, promised to bring Lucullus, 
<A NAME="484"></A>and seat him in a place of safety for his army, where there was a fort 
<A NAME="485"></A>that overlooked Cabira. Lucullus, believing him, lighted his fires, and 
<A NAME="486"></A>marched in the night; and safely passing the defile, gained the place, 
<A NAME="487"></A>and in the morning was seen above the enemy, pitching his camp in a place 
<A NAME="488"></A>advantageous to descend upon them if he desired to fight, and secure from 
<A NAME="489"></A>being forced if he preferred to lie still. Neither side was willing to 
<A NAME="490"></A>engage at present. But it is related that some of the king's party were 
<A NAME="491"></A>hunting a stag, and some Romans wanting to cut them off, came out and met 
<A NAME="492"></A>them. Whereupon they skirmished, more still drawing together to each side, 
<A NAME="493"></A>and at last the king's party prevailed, on which the Romans, from their 
<A NAME="494"></A>camp seeing their companions fly, were enraged, and ran to Lucullus with 
<A NAME="495"></A>entreaties to lead them out, demanding that the sign might be given for 
<A NAME="496"></A>battle. But he, that they might know of what consequence the presence and 
<A NAME="497"></A>appearance of a wise commander is in time of conflict and danger, ordered 
<A NAME="498"></A>them to stand still. But he went down himself into the plains, and meeting 
<A NAME="499"></A>with the foremost that fled, commanded them to stand and turn back with 
<A NAME="500"></A>him. These obeying, the rest also turned and formed again in a body, and 
<A NAME="501"></A>thus, with no great difficulty, drove back the enemies, and pursued them 
<A NAME="502"></A>to their camp. After his return, Lucullus inflicted the customary punishment 
<A NAME="503"></A>upon the fugitives, and made them dig a trench of twelve foot, working 
<A NAME="504"></A>in their frocks unfastened, while the rest stood by and looked 
<A NAME="505"></A>on.
<A NAME="506"></A><BR><BR>There was in Mithridates's camp one Olthacus, a chief of the Dandarians, 
<A NAME="507"></A>a barbarous people living near the lake Maeotis, a man remarkable for strength 
<A NAME="508"></A>and courage in fight, wise in council, and pleasant and ingratiating in 
<A NAME="509"></A>conversation. He, out of emulation, and a constant eagerness which possessed 
<A NAME="510"></A>him to outdo one of the other chiefs of his country, promised a great piece 
<A NAME="511"></A>of service to Mithridates, no less than the death of Lucullus. The king 
<A NAME="512"></A>commended his resolution, and, according to agreement, counterfeited anger, 
<A NAME="513"></A>and put some disgrace upon him; whereupon he took horse, and fled to Lucullus, 
<A NAME="514"></A>who kindly received him, being a man of great name in the army. After some 
<A NAME="515"></A>short trial of his sagacity and perseverance, he found way to Lucullus's 
<A NAME="516"></A>board and council. The Dandarian, thinking he had a fair opportunity, commanded 
<A NAME="517"></A>his servants to lead his horse out of the camp, while he himself, as the 
<A NAME="518"></A>soldiers were refreshing and resting themselves, it being then high noon, 
<A NAME="519"></A>went to the general's tent, not at all expecting that entrance would be 
<A NAME="520"></A>denied to one who was so familiar with him, and came under pretence of 
<A NAME="521"></A>extraordinary business with him. He had certainly been admitted had not 
<A NAME="522"></A>sleep, which has destroyed many captains, saved Lucullus. For so it was, 
<A NAME="523"></A>and Menedemus, one of the bedchamber, was standing at the door, who told 
<A NAME="524"></A>Olthacus that it was altogether unseasonable to see the general, since, 
<A NAME="525"></A>after long watching and hard labour, he was but just before laid down to 
<A NAME="526"></A>repose himself. Olthacus would not go away upon this denial, but still 
<A NAME="527"></A>persisted, saying that he must go in to speak of some necessary affairs, 
<A NAME="528"></A>whereupon Menedemus grew angry, and replied that nothing was more necessary 
<A NAME="529"></A>than the safety of Lucullus, and forced him away with both hands. Upon 
<A NAME="530"></A>which, out of fear, he straightway left the camp, took horse, and without 
<A NAME="531"></A>effect returned to Mithridates. Thus in action as in physic, it is the 
<A NAME="532"></A>critical moment that gives both the fortunate and the fatal 
<A NAME="533"></A>effect.
<A NAME="534"></A><BR><BR>After this, Sornatius being sent out with ten companies for forage, 
<A NAME="535"></A>and pursued by Menander, one of Mithridates's captains, stood his ground, 
<A NAME="536"></A>and after a sharp engagement, routed and slew a considerable number of 
<A NAME="537"></A>the enemy. Adrianus being sent afterward, with some forces, to procure 
<A NAME="538"></A>food enough and to spare for the camp, Mithridates did not let the opportunity 
<A NAME="539"></A>slip, but despatched Menemachus and Myro, with a great force, both horse 
<A NAME="540"></A>and foot, against him, all which except two men, it is stated, were cut 
<A NAME="541"></A>off by the Romans. Mithridates concealed the loss, giving it out that it 
<A NAME="542"></A>was a small defeat, nothing near so great as reported, and occasioned by 
<A NAME="543"></A>the unskillfulness of the leaders. But Adrianus in great pomp passed by 
<A NAME="544"></A>his camp, having many wagons full of corn and other booty, filling Mithridates 
<A NAME="545"></A>with distress, and the army with confusion and consternation. It was resolved, 
<A NAME="546"></A>therefore, to stay no longer. But when the king's servants sent away their 
<A NAME="547"></A>own goods quietly, and hindered others from doing so too, the soldiers 
<A NAME="548"></A>in great fury thronged and crowded to the gates, seized on the king's servants 
<A NAME="549"></A>and killed them, and plundered the baggage. Dorylaus, the general, in this 
<A NAME="550"></A>confusion, having nothing else besides his purple cloak, lost his life 
<A NAME="551"></A>for that, and Hermaeus the priest was trod underfoot in the 
<A NAME="552"></A>gate.
<A NAME="553"></A><BR><BR>Mithridates, having not one of his guards, nor even a groom remaining 
<A NAME="554"></A>with him, got out of the camp in the throng, but had none of his horses 
<A NAME="555"></A>with him; until Ptolemy, the eunuch, some little time after, seeing him 
<A NAME="556"></A>in the press making his way among the others, dismounted and gave his horse 
<A NAME="557"></A>to the king. The Romans were already close upon him in their pursuit, nor 
<A NAME="558"></A>was it through want of speed that they failed to catch him, but they were 
<A NAME="559"></A>as near as possible doing so. But greediness and a petty military avarice 
<A NAME="560"></A>hindered them from acquiring that booty which in so many fights and hazards 
<A NAME="561"></A>they had sought after, and lost Lucullus the prize of his victory. For 
<A NAME="562"></A>the horse which carried the king was within reach, but one of the mules 
<A NAME="563"></A>that carried the treasure either by accident stepping in, or by order of 
<A NAME="564"></A>the king so appointed to go between him and the pursuers, they seized and 
<A NAME="565"></A>pilfered the gold, and falling out among themselves about the prey, let 
<A NAME="566"></A>slip the great prize. Neither was their greediness prejudicial to Lucullus 
<A NAME="567"></A>in this only, but also they slew Callistratus, the king's confidential 
<A NAME="568"></A>attendant, under suspicion of having five hundred pieces of gold in his 
<A NAME="569"></A>girdle; whereas Lucullus had specially ordered that he should be conveyed 
<A NAME="570"></A>safe into the camp. Notwithstanding all which, he gave them leave to plunder 
<A NAME="571"></A>the camp.
<A NAME="572"></A><BR><BR>After this, in Cabira, and other strongholds which he took, he 
<A NAME="573"></A>found great treasures, and private prisons, in which many Greeks and many 
<A NAME="574"></A>of the king's relations had been confined, who, having long since counted 
<A NAME="575"></A>themselves no other than dead men, by the favour of Lucullus met not with 
<A NAME="576"></A>relief so truly as with a new life and second birth. Nyssa, also, sister 
<A NAME="577"></A>of Mithridates, enjoyed the like fortunate captivity; while those who seemed 
<A NAME="578"></A>to be most out of danger, his wives and sisters at Phernacia, placed in 
<A NAME="579"></A>safety as they thought, miserably perished, Mithridates in his flight sending 
<A NAME="580"></A>Bacchides the eunuch to them. Among others there were two sisters of the 
<A NAME="581"></A>king, Roxana and Statira, unmarried women forty years old, and two Ionian 
<A NAME="582"></A>wives. Berenice of Chios and Monime of Biletus. This latter was the most 
<A NAME="583"></A>celebrated among the Greeks, because she so long withstood the king in 
<A NAME="584"></A>his courtship to her, though he presented her with fifteen thousand pieces 
<A NAME="585"></A>of gold, until a covenant of marriage was made, and a crown was sent her, 
<A NAME="586"></A>and she was saluted queen. She had been a sorrowful woman before, and often 
<A NAME="587"></A>bewailed her beauty, that had procured her a keeper, instead of a husband, 
<A NAME="588"></A>and a watch of barbarians, instead of the home and attendance of a wife; 
<A NAME="589"></A>and, removed far from Greece, she enjoyed the pleasure which she proposed 
<A NAME="590"></A>to herself only in a dream, being in the meantime robbed of that which 
<A NAME="591"></A>is real. And when Bacchides came and bade them prepare for death, as every 
<A NAME="592"></A>one thought most easy and painless, she took the diadem from her head, 
<A NAME="593"></A>and fastening the string to her neck, suspended herself with it; which 
<A NAME="594"></A>soon breaking, "O wretched headband!" said she, "not able to help me even 
<A NAME="595"></A>in this small thing!" And throwing it away she spat on it, and offered 
<A NAME="596"></A>her throat to Bacchides. Berenice had prepared a potion for herself, but 
<A NAME="597"></A>at her mother's entreaty, who stood by, she gave her part of it. Both drank 
<A NAME="598"></A>the potion, which prevailed over the weaker body. But Berenice, having 
<A NAME="599"></A>drunk too little, was not released by it, but lingering on unable to die, 
<A NAME="600"></A>was strangled by Bacchides for haste. It is said that one of the unmarried 
<A NAME="601"></A>sisters drank the poison, with bitter execrations and curses; but Statira 
<A NAME="602"></A>uttered nothing ungentle or reproachful, but, on the contrary, commended 
<A NAME="603"></A>her brother, who in his own danger neglected not theirs, but carefully 
<A NAME="604"></A>provided that they might go out of the world without shame or 
<A NAME="605"></A>disgrace.
<A NAME="606"></A><BR><BR>Lucullus, being a good and humane man, was concerned at these things. 
<A NAME="607"></A>However, going on, he came to Talaura, from whence four days before his 
<A NAME="608"></A>arrival Mithridates had fled, and was got to Tigranes in Armenia. He turned 
<A NAME="609"></A>off, therefore, and subdued the Chaldeans and Tibarenians, with the lesser 
<A NAME="610"></A>Armenia, and having reduced all their forts and cities, he sent Appius 
<A NAME="611"></A>to Tigranes to demand Mithridates. He himself went to Amisus, which still 
<A NAME="612"></A>held out under the command of Callimachus, who, by his great engineering 
<A NAME="613"></A>skill, and his dexterity at all the shifts and subtleties of a siege, had 
<A NAME="614"></A>greatly incommoded the Romans. For which afterward he paid dear enough, 
<A NAME="615"></A>and was now outmanoeuvred by Lucullus, who, unexpectedly coming upon him 
<A NAME="616"></A>at the time of the day when the soldiers used to withdraw and rest themselves, 
<A NAME="617"></A>gained part of the wall, and forced him to leave the city, in doing which 
<A NAME="618"></A>he fired it; either envying the Romans the booty, or to secure his own 
<A NAME="619"></A>escape the better. No man looked after those who went off in the ships, 
<A NAME="620"></A>but as soon as the fire had seized on most part of the wall, the soldiers 
<A NAME="621"></A>prepared themselves for plunder; while Lucullus, pitying the ruin of the 
<A NAME="622"></A>city, brought assistance from without, and encouraged his men to extinguish 
<A NAME="623"></A>the flames. But all, being intent upon the prey, and giving no heed to 
<A NAME="624"></A>him, with loud outcries, beat and clashed their arms together, until he 
<A NAME="625"></A>was compelled to let them plunder, that by that means he might at least 
<A NAME="626"></A>save the city from fire. But they did quite the contrary, for in searching 
<A NAME="627"></A>the houses with lights and torches everywhere, they were themselves the 
<A NAME="628"></A>cause of the destruction of most of the buildings, inasmuch that when Lucullus 
<A NAME="629"></A>the next day went in, he shed tears, and said to his friends, that he had 
<A NAME="630"></A>often before blessed the fortune of Sylla, but never so much admired it 
<A NAME="631"></A>as then, because when he was willing he was also able to save Athens, "but 
<A NAME="632"></A>my infelicity is such, that while I endeavour to imitate him, I become 
<A NAME="633"></A>like Mummius." Nevertheless, he endeavoured to save as much of the city 
<A NAME="634"></A>as he could, and at the same time, also, by a happy providence a fall of 
<A NAME="635"></A>rain concurred to extinguish the fire. He himself while present repaired 
<A NAME="636"></A>the ruins as much as he could, receiving back the inhabitants who had fled, 
<A NAME="637"></A>and settling as many other Greeks as were willing to live there, adding 
<A NAME="638"></A>a hundred furlongs of ground to the place.
<A NAME="639"></A><BR><BR>This city was a colony of Athens, built at that time when she flourished 
<A NAME="640"></A>and was powerful at sea, upon which account many who fled from Aristion's 
<A NAME="641"></A>tyranny settled here, and were admitted as citizens, but had the ill-luck 
<A NAME="642"></A>to fly from evils at home into greater abroad. As many of these as survived 
<A NAME="643"></A>Lucullus furnished every one with clothes, and two hundred drachmas, and 
<A NAME="644"></A>sent them away into their own country. On this occasion Tyrannion the grammarian 
<A NAME="645"></A>was taken. Murena begged him of Lucullus, and took him and made him a freedman; 
<A NAME="646"></A>but in this he abused Lucullus's favour, who by no means liked that a man 
<A NAME="647"></A>of high repute for learning should be first made a slave and then freed; 
<A NAME="648"></A>for freedom thus speciously granted again was a real deprivation of what 
<A NAME="649"></A>he had before. But not in this case alone Murena showed himself far inferior 
<A NAME="650"></A>in generosity to the general.
<A NAME="651"></A><BR><BR>Lucullus was now busy in looking after the cities of Asia, and 
<A NAME="652"></A>having no war to divert his time, spent it in the administration of law 
<A NAME="653"></A>and justice, the want of which had for a long time left the province a 
<A NAME="654"></A>prey to unspeakable and incredible miseries; so plundered and enslaved 
<A NAME="655"></A>by tax-farmers and usurers that private people were compelled to sell their 
<A NAME="656"></A>sons in the flower of their youth, and their daughters in their virginity, 
<A NAME="657"></A>and the states publicly to sell their consecrated gifts, pictures, and 
<A NAME="658"></A>statues. In the end their lot was to yield themselves up slaves to their 
<A NAME="659"></A>creditors, but before this worse troubles befell them, tortures, inflicted 
<A NAME="660"></A>with ropes and by horses, standing abroad to be scorched when the sun was 
<A NAME="661"></A>hot, and being driven into ice and clay in the cold; insomuch that slavery 
<A NAME="662"></A>was no less than a redemption and joy to them. Lucullus in a short time 
<A NAME="663"></A>freed the cities from all these evils and oppressions; for, first of all, 
<A NAME="664"></A>he ordered there should be no more taken than one per cent. Secondly, where 
<A NAME="665"></A>the interest exceeded the principal, he struck it off. The third and most 
<A NAME="666"></A>considerable order was, that the creditor should receive the fourth part 
<A NAME="667"></A>of the debtor's income; but if any lender had added the interest to the 
<A NAME="668"></A>principal, it was utterly disallowed. Insomuch, that in the space of four 
<A NAME="669"></A>years all debts were paid and lands returned to their right owners. The 
<A NAME="670"></A>public debt was contracted when Asia was fined twenty thousand talents 
<A NAME="671"></A>by Sylla, but twice as much was paid to the collectors, who by their usury 
<A NAME="672"></A>had by this time advanced it to a hundred and twenty thousand talents. 
<A NAME="673"></A>And accordingly they inveighed against Lucullus at Rome, as grossly injured 
<A NAME="674"></A>by him, and by their money's help (as, indeed, they were very powerful, 
<A NAME="675"></A>and had many of the statesmen in their debt), they stirred up several leading 
<A NAME="676"></A>senators against him. But Lucullus was not only beloved by the cities which 
<A NAME="677"></A>he obliged, but was also wished for by other provinces, who blessed the 
<A NAME="678"></A>good-luck of those who had such a governor over them.
<A NAME="679"></A><BR><BR>Appius Clodius, who was sent to Tigranes (the same Clodius was 
<A NAME="680"></A>brother to Lucullus's wife), being led by the king's guides a roundabout 
<A NAME="681"></A>way, unnecessarily long and tedious, through the upper country, being informed 
<A NAME="682"></A>by his freedman, a Syrian by nation, of the direct road, left that lengthy 
<A NAME="683"></A>and fallacious one; and bidding the barbarians, his guides, adieu, in a 
<A NAME="684"></A>few days passed over Euphrates, and came to Antioch upon Daphne. There 
<A NAME="685"></A>being commanded to wait for Tigranes, who at that time was reducing some 
<A NAME="686"></A>towns in Phoenicia, he won over many chiefs to his side, who unwillingly 
<A NAME="687"></A>submitted to the King of Armenia, among whom was Zarbienus, King of the 
<A NAME="688"></A>Gordyenians; also many of the conquered cities corresponded privately with 
<A NAME="689"></A>him, whom he assured of relief from Lucullus, but ordered them to lie still 
<A NAME="690"></A>at present. The Armenian government was an oppressive one, and intolerable 
<A NAME="691"></A>to the Greeks, especially that of the present king, who, growing insolent 
<A NAME="692"></A>and overbearing with his success, imagined all things valuable and esteemed 
<A NAME="693"></A>among men not only were his in fact, but had been purposely created for 
<A NAME="694"></A>him alone. From a small and inconsiderable beginning, he had gone on to 
<A NAME="695"></A>be the conqueror of many nations, had humbled the Parthian power more than 
<A NAME="696"></A>any before him, and filled Mesopotamia with Greeks, whom he carried in 
<A NAME="697"></A>numbers out of Cilicia and Cappadocia. He transplanted also the Arabs, 
<A NAME="698"></A>who lived in tents, from their country and home, and settled them near 
<A NAME="699"></A>him, that by their means he might carry on the trade.
<A NAME="700"></A><BR><BR>He had many kings waiting on him, but four he always carried with 
<A NAME="701"></A>him as servants and guards, who, when he rode, ran by his horse's side 
<A NAME="702"></A>in ordinary under-frocks, and attended him, when sitting on his throne, 
<A NAME="703"></A>and publishing his decrees to the people, with their hands folded together; 
<A NAME="704"></A>which posture of all others was that which most expressed slavery, it being 
<A NAME="705"></A>that of men who had bidden adieu to liberty, and had prepared their bodies 
<A NAME="706"></A>more for chastisement than the service of their masters. Appius, nothing 
<A NAME="707"></A>dismayed or surprised at this theatrical display, as soon as audience was 
<A NAME="708"></A>granted him, said he came to demand Mithridates for Lucullus's triumph, 
<A NAME="709"></A>otherwise to denounce war against Tigranes: insomuch that though Tigranes 
<A NAME="710"></A>endeavoured to receive him with a smooth countenance and a forced smile, 
<A NAME="711"></A>he could not dissemble his discomposure to those who stood about him at 
<A NAME="712"></A>the bold language of the young man; for it was the first time, perhaps, 
<A NAME="713"></A>in twenty-five years, the length of his reign, or, more truly, of his tyranny, 
<A NAME="714"></A>that any free speech had been uttered to him. However, he made answer to 
<A NAME="715"></A>Appius, that he would not desert Mithridates, and would defend himself, 
<A NAME="716"></A>if the Romans attacked him. He was angry, also, with Lucullus for calling 
<A NAME="717"></A>him only king in his letter, and not king of kings, and, in his answer, 
<A NAME="718"></A>would not give him his title of imperator. Great gifts were sent to Appius, 
<A NAME="719"></A>which he refused; but on their being sent again and augmented, that he 
<A NAME="720"></A>might not seem to refuse in anger, he took one goblet and sent the rest 
<A NAME="721"></A>back, and without delay went off to the general.
<A NAME="722"></A><BR><BR>Tigranes before this neither vouchsafed to see nor speak with Mithridates, 
<A NAME="723"></A>though a near kinsman, and forced out of so considerable a kingdom, but 
<A NAME="724"></A>proudly and scornfully kept him at a distance, as a sort of prisoner, in 
<A NAME="725"></A>a marshy and unhealthy district; but now, with much profession of respect 
<A NAME="726"></A>and kindness, he sent for him, and at a private conference between them 
<A NAME="727"></A>in the palace, they healed up all private jealousies between them, punishing 
<A NAME="728"></A>their favourites, who bore all the blame; among whom Metrodorus of Scepsis 
<A NAME="729"></A>was one, an eloquent and learned man, and so close an intimate as commonly 
<A NAME="730"></A>to be called the king's father. This man, as it happened, being employed 
<A NAME="731"></A>in an embassy by Mithridates to solicit help against the Romans, Tigranes 
<A NAME="732"></A>asked him, "What would you, Metrodorus, advise me to in this affair?" In 
<A NAME="733"></A>return to which, either out of good-will to Tigranes, or a want of solicitude 
<A NAME="734"></A>for Mithridates, he made answer, that as ambassador he counselled him to 
<A NAME="735"></A>it, but as a friend dissuaded him from it. This Tigranes reported and affirmed 
<A NAME="736"></A>to Mithridates, thinking that no irreparable harm would come of it to Metrodorus. 
<A NAME="737"></A>But upon this he was presently taken off, and Tigranes was sorry for what 
<A NAME="738"></A>he had done, though he had not, indeed, been absolutely the cause of his 
<A NAME="739"></A>death; yet he had given the fatal turn to the anger of Mithridates, who 
<A NAME="740"></A>had privately hated him before, as appeared from his cabinet papers when 
<A NAME="741"></A>taken, among which there was an order that Metrodorus should die. Tigranes 
<A NAME="742"></A>buried him splendidly, sparing no cost to his dead body, whom he betrayed 
<A NAME="743"></A>when alive. In Tigranes's court died, also, Amphicrates the orator (if, 
<A NAME="744"></A>for the sake of Athens, we may also mention him), of whom it is told that 
<A NAME="745"></A>he left his country and fled to Seleucia, upon the river Tigris, and, being 
<A NAME="746"></A>desired to teach logic among them, arrogantly replied, that the dish was 
<A NAME="747"></A>too little to hold a dolphin. He, therefore, came to Cleopatra, daughter 
<A NAME="748"></A>of Mithridates, and queen to Tigranes, but, being accused of misdemeanours, 
<A NAME="749"></A>prohibited all commerce with his countrymen, ended his days by starving 
<A NAME="750"></A>himself. He, in like manner, received from Cleopatra an honourable burial, 
<A NAME="751"></A>near Sapha, a place so called in that country.
<A NAME="752"></A><BR><BR>Lucullus, when he had re-established law and a lasting peace in 
<A NAME="753"></A>Asia, did not altogether forget pleasure and mirth, but, during his residence 
<A NAME="754"></A>at Ephesus, gratified the cities with sports, festival triumphs, wrestling 
<A NAME="755"></A>games, and single combats of gladiators. And they, in requital, instituted 
<A NAME="756"></A>others, called Lucullean games, in honour to him, thus manifesting their 
<A NAME="757"></A>love to him, which was of more value to him than all the honour. But when 
<A NAME="758"></A>Appius came to him and told him he must prepare for war with Tigranes, 
<A NAME="759"></A>he went again into Pontus, and, gathering together his army, besieged Sinope, 
<A NAME="760"></A>or rather the Cilicians of the king's side who held it; who thereupon killed 
<A NAME="761"></A>a number of the Sinopians, and set the city on fire, and by night endeavoured 
<A NAME="762"></A>to escape. Which when Lucullus perceived, he entered the city, and killed 
<A NAME="763"></A>eight thousand of them who were still left behind; but restored to the 
<A NAME="764"></A>inhabitants what was their own, and took special care for the welfare of 
<A NAME="765"></A>the city. To which he was chiefly prompted by this vision. One seemed to 
<A NAME="766"></A>come to him in his sleep, and say, "Go on a little further, Lucullus, for 
<A NAME="767"></A>Autolycus is coming to see thee." When he arose he could not imagine what 
<A NAME="768"></A>the vision meant. The same day he took the city, and as he was pursuing 
<A NAME="769"></A>the Cilicians, who were flying by sea, he saw a statue lying on the shore, 
<A NAME="770"></A>which the Cilicians carried so far, but had not time to carry aboard. It 
<A NAME="771"></A>was one of the masterpieces of Sthenis. And one told him that it was the 
<A NAME="772"></A>statue of Autolycus, the founder of the city. This Autolycus is reported 
<A NAME="773"></A>to have been son to Deimachus, and one of those who, under Hercules, went 
<A NAME="774"></A>on the expedition out of Thessaly against the Amazons; from whence in his 
<A NAME="775"></A>return with Demoleon and Phlogius, he lost his vessel on a point of the 
<A NAME="776"></A>Chersonesus, called Pedalium. He himself, with his companions and their 
<A NAME="777"></A>weapons, being saved, came to Sinope, and dispossessed the Syrians there. 
<A NAME="778"></A>The Syrians held it, descended from Syrus, as is the story, the son of 
<A NAME="779"></A>Apollo and Sinope, the daughter of Asopus. Which as soon as Lucullus heard 
<A NAME="780"></A>he remembered the admonition of Sylla, whose advice it is in his Memoirs 
<A NAME="781"></A>to treat nothing as so certain and so worthy of reliance as an intimation 
<A NAME="782"></A>given in dreams.
<A NAME="783"></A><BR><BR>When it was now told him that Mithridates and Tigranes were just 
<A NAME="784"></A>ready to transport their forces into Lycaonia and Cilicia, with the object 
<A NAME="785"></A>of entering Asia before him, he wondered much why the Armenian, supposing 
<A NAME="786"></A>him to entertain any real intentions to fight with the Romans, did not 
<A NAME="787"></A>assist Mithridates in his flourishing condition, and join forces when he 
<A NAME="788"></A>was fit for service, instead of suffering him to be vanquished and broken 
<A NAME="789"></A>in pieces, and now at last beginning the war, when its hopes were grown 
<A NAME="790"></A>cold, and throwing himself down headlong with them, who were irrevocably 
<A NAME="791"></A>fallen already. But when Machares, the son of Mithridates, and governor 
<A NAME="792"></A>of Bosporus, sent him a crown, valued at a thousand pieces of gold, and 
<A NAME="793"></A>desired to be enrolled as a friend and confederate of the Romans, he fairly 
<A NAME="794"></A>reputed that war at an end, and left Sornatius, his deputy, with six thousand 
<A NAME="795"></A>soldiers, to take care of Pontus. He himself, with twelve thousand foot 
<A NAME="796"></A>and a little less than three thousand horse, went forth to the second war, 
<A NAME="797"></A>advancing, it seemed very plain, with too great and ill-advised speed, 
<A NAME="798"></A>into the midst of warlike nations and many thousands upon thousands of 
<A NAME="799"></A>horse, into an unknown extent of country, every way inclosed with deep 
<A NAME="800"></A>rivers and mountains, never free from snow; which made the soldiers, already 
<A NAME="801"></A>far from orderly, follow him with great unwillingness and opposition. For 
<A NAME="802"></A>the same reason, also, the popular leaders at home publicly inveighed and 
<A NAME="803"></A>declaimed against him, as one that raised up war after war, not so much 
<A NAME="804"></A>for the interest of the republic, as that he himself, being still in commission, 
<A NAME="805"></A>might not lay down arms, but go on enriching himself by the public dangers. 
<A NAME="806"></A>These men, in the end, effected their purpose. But Lucullus, by long journeys, 
<A NAME="807"></A>came to the Euphrates, where, finding the waters high and rough from the 
<A NAME="808"></A>winter, he was much troubled for fear of delay and difficulty while he 
<A NAME="809"></A>should procure boats and make a bridge of them. But in the evening the 
<A NAME="810"></A>flood beginning to retire, and decreasing all through the night, the next 
<A NAME="811"></A>day they saw the river far down within his banks, so much so that the inhabitants, 
<A NAME="812"></A>discovering the little islands in the river, and the water stagnating among 
<A NAME="813"></A>them, a thing which had rarely happened before, made obeisance to Lucullus, 
<A NAME="814"></A>before whom the very river was humble and submissive, and yielded an easy 
<A NAME="815"></A>and swift passage. Making use of the opportunity, he carried over his army, 
<A NAME="816"></A>and met with a lucky sign at landing. Holy heifers are pastured on purpose 
<A NAME="817"></A>for Diana Persia, whom, of all the gods, the barbarians beyond Euphrates 
<A NAME="818"></A>chiefly adore. They use these heifers only for her sacrifices. At other 
<A NAME="819"></A>times they wander up and down undisturbed, with the mark of the goddess, 
<A NAME="820"></A>a torch, branded on them; and it is no such light or easy thing, when occasion 
<A NAME="821"></A>requires, to seize one of them. But one of these, when the army had passed 
<A NAME="822"></A>the Euphrates, coming to a rock consecrated to the goddess, stood upon 
<A NAME="823"></A>it, and then, laying down her neck, like others that are forced down with 
<A NAME="824"></A>a rope, offered herself to Lucullus for sacrifice. Besides which, he offered 
<A NAME="825"></A>also a bull to Euphrates, for safe passage. That day he tarried there, 
<A NAME="826"></A>but on the next, and those that followed, he travelled through Sophene, 
<A NAME="827"></A>using no manner of violence to the people who came to him and willingly 
<A NAME="828"></A>received his army. And when the soldiers were desirous to plunder a castle 
<A NAME="829"></A>that seemed to be well stored within, "That is the castle," said he, "that 
<A NAME="830"></A>we must storm," showing them Taurus at a distance; "the rest is reserved 
<A NAME="831"></A>for those who conquer there." Wherefore hastening his march, and passing 
<A NAME="832"></A>the Tigris, he came over into Armenia.
<A NAME="833"></A><BR><BR>The first messenger that gave notice of Lucullus's coming was so 
<A NAME="834"></A>far from pleasing Tigranes that he had his head cut off for his pains; 
<A NAME="835"></A>and no man daring to bring further information, without any intelligence 
<A NAME="836"></A>at all, Tigranes sat while war was already blazing around him, giving ear 
<A NAME="837"></A>only to those who flattered him, by saying that Lucullus would show himself 
<A NAME="838"></A>a great commander if he ventured to wait for Tigranes at Ephesus, and did 
<A NAME="839"></A>not at once fly out of Asia at the mere sight of the many thousands that 
<A NAME="840"></A>were come against him. He is a man of a strong body that can carry off 
<A NAME="841"></A>a great quantity of wine, and of a powerful constitution of mind that can 
<A NAME="842"></A>sustain felicity. Mithrobarzanes, one of his chief favourites, first dared 
<A NAME="843"></A>to tell him the truth, but had no more thanks for his freedom of speech 
<A NAME="844"></A>than to be immediately sent out against Lucullus with three thousand horse, 
<A NAME="845"></A>and a great number of foot, with peremptory demands to bring him alive 
<A NAME="846"></A>and trample down his army. Some of Lucullus's men were then pitching their 
<A NAME="847"></A>camp, and the rest were coming up to them, when the scouts gave notice 
<A NAME="848"></A>that the enemy was approaching, whereupon he was in fear lest they should 
<A NAME="849"></A>fall upon him, while his men were divided and unarranged; which made him 
<A NAME="850"></A>stay to pitch the camp himself, and send out Sextilius the legate, with 
<A NAME="851"></A>sixteen hundred horse, and about as many heavy and light arms, with orders 
<A NAME="852"></A>to advance towards the enemy, and wait until intelligence came to him that 
<A NAME="853"></A>the camp was finished. Sextilius designed to have kept this order; but 
<A NAME="854"></A>Mithrobarzanes coming furiously upon him, he was forced to fight. In the 
<A NAME="855"></A>engagement, Mithrobarzanes himself was slain, fighting, and all his men, 
<A NAME="856"></A>except a few who ran away, were destroyed. After this, Tigranes left Tigranocerta, 
<A NAME="857"></A>a great city built by himself, and retired to Taurus, and called all his 
<A NAME="858"></A>forces about him.
<A NAME="859"></A><BR><BR>But Lucullus, giving him no time to rendezvous, sent out Murena 
<A NAME="860"></A>to harass and cut off those who marched to Tigranes, and Sextilius, also, 
<A NAME="861"></A>to disperse a great company of Arabians then on the way to the king. Sextilius 
<A NAME="862"></A>fell upon the Arabians in their camp, and destroyed most of them, and also 
<A NAME="863"></A>Murena, in his pursuit after Tigranes through a craggy and narrow pass, 
<A NAME="864"></A>opportunely fell upon him. Upon which Tigranes, abandoning all his baggage, 
<A NAME="865"></A>fled; many of the Armenians were killed and more taken. After this success, 
<A NAME="866"></A>Lucullus went to Tigranocerta, and sitting down before the city, besieged 
<A NAME="867"></A>it. In it were many Greeks carried away out of Cilicia, and many barbarians 
<A NAME="868"></A>in like circumstances with the Greeks, Adiabenians, Assyrians, Gordyenians, 
<A NAME="869"></A>and Cappadocians, whose native cities he had destroyed, and forced away 
<A NAME="870"></A>the inhabitants to settle here. It was a rich and beautiful city, every 
<A NAME="871"></A>common man, and every man of rank, in imitation of the king, studied to 
<A NAME="872"></A>enlarge and adorn it. This made Lucullus more vigorously press the siege, 
<A NAME="873"></A>in the belief that Tigranes would not patiently endure it, but even against 
<A NAME="874"></A>his own judgment would come down in anger to force him away; in which he 
<A NAME="875"></A>was not mistaken. Mithridates earnestly dissuaded him from it, sending 
<A NAME="876"></A>messengers and letters to him not to engage, but rather with his horse 
<A NAME="877"></A>to try and cut off the supplies. Taxiles, also, who came from Mithridates, 
<A NAME="878"></A>and who stayed with his army, very much entreated the king to forbear, 
<A NAME="879"></A>and to avoid the Roman arms, things it was not safe to meddle with. To 
<A NAME="880"></A>this he hearkened at first, but when the Armenians and Gordyenians in a 
<A NAME="881"></A>full body, and the whole force of Medes and Adiabenians, under their respective 
<A NAME="882"></A>kings, joined him; when many Arabians came up from the sea beyond Babylon; 
<A NAME="883"></A>and from the Caspian sea, the Albanians and the Iberians their neighbours, 
<A NAME="884"></A>and not a few of the free people, without kings, living about the Araxes, 
<A NAME="885"></A>by entreaty and hire also came together to him; and all the king's feasts 
<A NAME="886"></A>and councils rang of nothing but expectations, boastings, and barbaric 
<A NAME="887"></A>threatenings, Taxiles went in danger of his life for giving council against 
<A NAME="888"></A>fighting, and it was imputed to envy in Mithridates thus to discourage 
<A NAME="889"></A>him from so glorious an enterprise. Therefore Tigranes would by no means 
<A NAME="890"></A>tarry for him, for fear he should share in the glory, but marched on with 
<A NAME="891"></A>all his army, lamenting to his friends, as it is said, that he should fight 
<A NAME="892"></A>with Lucullus alone and not with all the Roman generals together. Neither 
<A NAME="893"></A>was his boldness to be accounted wholly frantic or unreasonable when he 
<A NAME="894"></A>had so many nations and kings attending him, and so many tens of thousands 
<A NAME="895"></A>of well-armed foot and horse about him. He had twenty thousand archers 
<A NAME="896"></A>and slingers, fifty-five thousand horse, of which seventeen thousand were 
<A NAME="897"></A>in complete armour, as Lucullus wrote to the senate, a hundred and fifty 
<A NAME="898"></A>thousand heavy-armed men, drawn up partly into cohorts, partly into phalanxes, 
<A NAME="899"></A>besides various divisions of men appointed to make roads and lay bridges, 
<A NAME="900"></A>to drain off waters and cut wood, and to perform other necessary services, 
<A NAME="901"></A>to the number of thirty-five thousand, who, being quartered behind the 
<A NAME="902"></A>army, added to its strength, and made it the more formidable to 
<A NAME="903"></A>behold.
<A NAME="904"></A><BR><BR>As soon as he had passed Taurus, and appeared with his forces, 
<A NAME="905"></A>and saw the Romans beleaguering Tigranocerta, the barbarous people within, 
<A NAME="906"></A>with shoutings and acclamations, received the sight, and threatening the 
<A NAME="907"></A>Romans from the walls, pointed to the Armenians. In a council of war, some 
<A NAME="908"></A>advised Lucullus to leave the siege, and march up to Tigranes, others that 
<A NAME="909"></A>it would not be safe to leave the siege, and so many enemies behind. He 
<A NAME="910"></A>answered that neither side by itself was right, but together both gave 
<A NAME="911"></A>sound advice; and accordingly he divided his army, and left Murena with 
<A NAME="912"></A>six thousand foot in charge of the siege, and himself went out with twenty-four 
<A NAME="913"></A>cohorts, in which were no more than ten thousand men-at-arms, and with 
<A NAME="914"></A>all the horse and slingers and archers and about a thousand sitting down 
<A NAME="915"></A>by the river in a large plain, he appeared, indeed, very inconsiderable 
<A NAME="916"></A>to Tigranes, and a fit subject for the flattering wits about him. Some 
<A NAME="917"></A>of whom jeered, others cast lots for the spoil, and every one of the kings 
<A NAME="918"></A>and commanders came and desired to undertake the engagement alone, and 
<A NAME="919"></A>that he would be pleased to sit still and behold. Tigranes himself, wishing 
<A NAME="920"></A>to be witty and pleasant upon the occasion, made use of the well-known 
<A NAME="921"></A>saying, that they were too many for ambassadors, and too few for soldiers. 
<A NAME="922"></A>Thus they continued sneering and scoffing. As soon as day came, Lucullus 
<A NAME="923"></A>brought out his forces under arms. The barbarian army stood on the eastern 
<A NAME="924"></A>side of the river, and there being a bend of the river westward in that 
<A NAME="925"></A>part of it, where it was easiest forded, Lucullus, while he led his army 
<A NAME="926"></A>on in haste, seemed to Tigranes to be flying; who thereupon called Taxiles, 
<A NAME="927"></A>and in derision said, "Do you not see these invincible Romans flying?" 
<A NAME="928"></A>But Taxiles replied, "Would, indeed, O king, that some such unlikely piece 
<A NAME="929"></A>of fortune might be destined you; but the Romans do not, when going on 
<A NAME="930"></A>a march, put on their best clothes, nor use bright shields, and naked headpieces, 
<A NAME="931"></A>as now you see them, with the leathern coverings all taken off, but this 
<A NAME="932"></A>is a preparation for war of men just ready to engage with their enemies." 
<A NAME="933"></A>While Taxiles was thus speaking, as Lucullus wheeled about, the first eagle 
<A NAME="934"></A>appeared, and the cohorts, according to their divisions and companies, 
<A NAME="935"></A>formed in order to pass over, when with much ado, and like a man that is 
<A NAME="936"></A>just recovering from a drunken fit, Tigranes cried out twice or thrice, 
<A NAME="937"></A>"What, are they upon us?" In great confusion, therefore, the army got in 
<A NAME="938"></A>array, the king keeping the main body to himself, while the left wing giving 
<A NAME="939"></A>in charge to the Adiabenian, and the right to the Mede, in front of which 
<A NAME="940"></A>latter were posted most of the heavy-armed cavalry. Some officers advised 
<A NAME="941"></A>Lucullus, just as he was going to cross the river, to lie still, that day 
<A NAME="942"></A>being one of the unfortunate ones which they call black days, for on it 
<A NAME="943"></A>the army under Caepio, engaging with the Cimbrians was destroyed. But he 
<A NAME="944"></A>returned the famous answer, "I will make it a happy day to the Romans." 
<A NAME="945"></A>It was the day before the Nones of October.
<A NAME="946"></A><BR><BR>Having so said, he bade them take courage, passed over the river, 
<A NAME="947"></A>and himself first of all led them against the enemy, clad in a coat of 
<A NAME="948"></A>mail, with shining steel scales and a fringed mantle; and his sword might 
<A NAME="949"></A>already be seen out of the scabbard, as if to signify that they must without 
<A NAME="950"></A>delay come to a hand-to-hand combat with an enemy whose skill was in distant 
<A NAME="951"></A>fighting, and by the speed of their advance curtail the space that exposed 
<A NAME="952"></A>them to the archery. But when he saw the heavy-armed horse, the flower 
<A NAME="953"></A>of the army, drawn up under a hill, on the top of which was a broad and 
<A NAME="954"></A>open plain about four furlongs distant, and of no very difficult or troublesome 
<A NAME="955"></A>access, he commanded his Thracian and Galatian horse to fall upon their 
<A NAME="956"></A>flank, and beat down their lances with their swords. The only defence of 
<A NAME="957"></A>these horsemen-at-arms are their lances; they have nothing else that they 
<A NAME="958"></A>can use to protect themselves or annoy their enemy, on account of the weight 
<A NAME="959"></A>and stiffness of their armour, with which they are, as it were, built up. 
<A NAME="960"></A>He himself, with two cohorts, made to the mountain, the soldiers briskly 
<A NAME="961"></A>following, when they saw him in arms afoot first toiling and climbing up. 
<A NAME="962"></A>Being on the top and standing in an open place, with a loud voice he cried 
<A NAME="963"></A>out, "We have overcome, we have overcome, fellow-soldiers!" And having 
<A NAME="964"></A>so said, he marched against the armed horsemen, commanding his men not 
<A NAME="965"></A>to throw their javelins, but coming up hand-to-hand with the enemy, to 
<A NAME="966"></A>hack their shins and thighs, which parts alone were unguarded in these 
<A NAME="967"></A>heavy-armed horsemen. But there was no need of this way of fighting, for 
<A NAME="968"></A>they stood not to receive the Romans, but with great clamour and worse 
<A NAME="969"></A>flight they and their heavy horses threw themselves upon the ranks of the 
<A NAME="970"></A>foot, before ever these could so much as begin the fight, insomuch that 
<A NAME="971"></A>without a wound or bloodshed, so many thousands were overthrown. The greatest 
<A NAME="972"></A>slaughter was made in the flight, or rather in the endeavouring to fly 
<A NAME="973"></A>away, which they could not well do by reason of the depth and closeness 
<A NAME="974"></A>of their own ranks, which hindered them. Tigranes at first fled with a 
<A NAME="975"></A>few, but seeing his son in the same misfortune, he took the diadem from 
<A NAME="976"></A>his head, and with tears gave it him, bidding him save himself by some 
<A NAME="977"></A>other road if he could. But the young man, not daring to put it on, gave 
<A NAME="978"></A>it to one of his trustiest servants to keep for him. This man, as it happened, 
<A NAME="979"></A>being taken, was brought to Lucullus, and so, among the captives, the crown 
<A NAME="980"></A>of Tigranes was also taken. It is stated that above a hundred thousand 
<A NAME="981"></A>foot were lost, and that of the horse but very few escaped at all. Of the 
<A NAME="982"></A>Romans, a hundred were wounded and five killed. Antiochus the philosopher, 
<A NAME="983"></A>making mention of this fight in his book about the gods, says that the 
<A NAME="984"></A>sun never saw the like. Strabo, a second philosopher, in his historical 
<A NAME="985"></A>collection, says that the Romans could not but blush and deride themselves 
<A NAME="986"></A>for putting on armour against such pitiful slaves. Livy also says that 
<A NAME="987"></A>the Romans never fought an enemy with such unequal forces, for the conquerors 
<A NAME="988"></A>were not so much as one-twentieth part of the number of the conquered. 
<A NAME="989"></A>The most sagacious and experienced Roman commanders made it a chief commendation 
<A NAME="990"></A>of Lucullus that he had conquered two great and potent kings by two most 
<A NAME="991"></A>opposite ways, haste and delay. For he wore out the flourishing power of 
<A NAME="992"></A>Mithridates by delay and time, and crushed that of Tigranes by haste; being 
<A NAME="993"></A>one of the rare examples of generals who made use of delay for active achievement 
<A NAME="994"></A>and speed for security.
<A NAME="995"></A><BR><BR>On this account it was that Mithridates had made no haste to come 
<A NAME="996"></A>up to fight, imagining Lucullus would, as he had done before, use caution 
<A NAME="997"></A>and delay, which made him march at his leisure to join Tigranes. And first, 
<A NAME="998"></A>as he began to meet some straggling Armenians in the way, making off in 
<A NAME="999"></A>great fear and consternation, he suspected the worst, and when greater 
<A NAME="1000"></A>numbers of stripped and wounded men met him and assured him of the defeat, 
<A NAME="1001"></A>he set out to seek for Tigranes. And finding him destitute and humiliated, 
<A NAME="1002"></A>he by no means requited him with insolence, but alighting from his horse, 
<A NAME="1003"></A>and condoling with him on their common loss, he gave him his own royal 
<A NAME="1004"></A>guard to attend him, and animated him for the future. And they together 
<A NAME="1005"></A>gathered fresh forces about them. In the city Tigranocerta, the Greeks 
<A NAME="1006"></A>meantime, dividing from the barbarians, sought to deliver it up to Lucullus, 
<A NAME="1007"></A>and he attacked and took it. He seized on the treasure himself, but gave 
<A NAME="1008"></A>the city to be plundered by the soldiers, in which were found, amongst 
<A NAME="1009"></A>other property, eight thousand talents of coined money. Besides this, also, 
<A NAME="1010"></A>he distributed eight hundred drachmas to each man out of the spoils. When 
<A NAME="1011"></A>he understood that many players were taken in the city, whom Tigranes had 
<A NAME="1012"></A>invited from all parts for opening the theatre which he had built, he made 
<A NAME="1013"></A>use of them for celebrating his triumphal games and spectacles. The Greeks 
<A NAME="1014"></A>he sent home, allowing them money for their journey, and the barbarians 
<A NAME="1015"></A>also, as many as had been forced away from their own dwellings. So that 
<A NAME="1016"></A>by this one city being dissolved, many, by the restitution of their former 
<A NAME="1017"></A>inhabitants, were restored. By all of which Lucullus was beloved as a benefactor 
<A NAME="1018"></A>and founder. Other successes, also, attended him, such as he well deserved, 
<A NAME="1019"></A>desirous as he was far more of praise for acts of justice and clemency, 
<A NAME="1020"></A>than for feats in war, these being due partly to the soldiers, and very 
<A NAME="1021"></A>greatly to fortune, while those are the sure proofs of a gentle and liberal 
<A NAME="1022"></A>soul; and by such aids Lucullus, at that time, even without the help of 
<A NAME="1023"></A>arms, succeeded in reducing the barbarians. For the kings of the Arabians 
<A NAME="1024"></A>came to him, tendering what they had, and with them the Sophenians also 
<A NAME="1025"></A>submitted. And he so dealt with the Gordyenians, that they were willing 
<A NAME="1026"></A>to leave their own habitations, and to follow him with their wives and 
<A NAME="1027"></A>children. Which was for this cause. Zarbienus, King of the Gordyenians, 
<A NAME="1028"></A>as has been told, being impatient under the tyranny of Tigranes, had by 
<A NAME="1029"></A>Appius secretly made overtures of confederacy with Lucullus, but, being 
<A NAME="1030"></A>discovered, was executed, and his wife and children with him, before the 
<A NAME="1031"></A>Romans entered Armenia. Lucullus forgot not this, but coming to the Gordyenians 
<A NAME="1032"></A>made a solemn interment in honour of Zarbienus, and adorning the funeral 
<A NAME="1033"></A>pile with royal robes, and gold, and the spoils of Tigranes, he himself 
<A NAME="1034"></A>in person kindled the fire, and poured in perfumes with the friends and 
<A NAME="1035"></A>relations of the deceased, calling him his companion and the confederate 
<A NAME="1036"></A>of the Romans. He ordered, also, a costly monument to be built for him. 
<A NAME="1037"></A>There was a large treasure of gold and silver found in Zarbienus's palace, 
<A NAME="1038"></A>and no less than three million measures of corn, so that the soldiers were 
<A NAME="1039"></A>provided for, and Lucullus had the high commendation of maintaining the 
<A NAME="1040"></A>war at its own charge, without receiving one drachma from the public 
<A NAME="1041"></A>treasury.
<A NAME="1042"></A><BR><BR>After this came an embassy from the King of Parthia to him, desiring 
<A NAME="1043"></A>amity and confederacy; which being readily embraced by Lucullus, another 
<A NAME="1044"></A>was sent by him in return to the Parthian, the members of which discovered 
<A NAME="1045"></A>him to be a double-minded man, and to be dealing privately at the same 
<A NAME="1046"></A>time with Tigranes, offering to take part with him, upon condition Mesopotamia 
<A NAME="1047"></A>were delivered up to him. Which as soon as Lucullus understood, he resolved 
<A NAME="1048"></A>to pass by Tigranes and Mithridates as antagonists already overcome, and 
<A NAME="1049"></A>to try the power of Parthia, by leading his army against them, thinking 
<A NAME="1050"></A>it would be a glorious result, thus in one current of war, like an athlete 
<A NAME="1051"></A>in the games, to throw down three kings one after another, and successively 
<A NAME="1052"></A>to deal as a conqueror with three of the greatest power under heaven. He 
<A NAME="1053"></A>sent, therefore, into Pontus to Sornatius and his colleagues, bidding them 
<A NAME="1054"></A>bring the army thence, and join with him in his expedition out of Gordyene. 
<A NAME="1055"></A>The soldiers there, however, who had been restive and unruly before, now 
<A NAME="1056"></A>openly displayed their mutinous temper. No manner of entreaty or force 
<A NAME="1057"></A>availed with them, but they protested and cried out that they would stay 
<A NAME="1058"></A>no longer even there, but would go away and desert Pontus. The news of 
<A NAME="1059"></A>which, when reported to Lucullus, did no small harm to the soldiers about 
<A NAME="1060"></A>him, who were already corrupted with wealth and plenty, and desirous of 
<A NAME="1061"></A>ease. And on hearing the boldness of the others, they called them men, 
<A NAME="1062"></A>and declared they themselves ought to follow their example, for the actions 
<A NAME="1063"></A>which they had done did now well deserve release from service and 
<A NAME="1064"></A>repose.
<A NAME="1065"></A><BR><BR>Upon these and worse words, Lucullus gave up the thoughts of invading 
<A NAME="1066"></A>Parthia, and in the height of summer-time went against Tigranes. Passing 
<A NAME="1067"></A>over Taurus, he was filled with apprehension at the greenness of the fields 
<A NAME="1068"></A>before him, so long is the season deferred in this region by the coldness 
<A NAME="1069"></A>of the air. But nevertheless, he went down, and twice or thrice putting 
<A NAME="1070"></A>to flight the Armenians who dared to come out against him, he plundered 
<A NAME="1071"></A>and burnt their villages, and seizing on the provision designed for Tigranes, 
<A NAME="1072"></A>reduced his enemies to the necessity which he had feared for himself. But 
<A NAME="1073"></A>when, after doing all he could to provoke the enemy to fight, by drawing 
<A NAME="1074"></A>entrenchments round their camp and by burning the country before them, 
<A NAME="1075"></A>he could by no means bring them to venture out, after their frequent defeats 
<A NAME="1076"></A>before, he rose up and marched to Artaxata, the royal city of Tigranes, 
<A NAME="1077"></A>where his wives and young children were kept, judging that Tigranes would 
<A NAME="1078"></A>never suffer that to go without the hazard of a battle. It is related that 
<A NAME="1079"></
