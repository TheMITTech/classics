The Comparison of Lucullus with Cimon
By Plutarch


Translated by John Dryden

One might bless the end of Lucullus, which was so timed as to let
him die before the great revolution, which fate, by intestine wars,
was already effecting against the established government, and to close
his life in a free though troubled commonwealth. And in this, above
all other things, Cimon and he are alike. For he died also when Greece
was as yet undisordered, in its highest felicity; though in the field
at the head of his army, not recalled, nor out of his mind, nor sullying
the glory of his wars, engagements, and conquests, by making feastings
and debauches seem the apparent end and aim of them all; as Plato
says scornfully of Orpheus, that he makes an eternal debauch hereafter
the reward of those who lived well here. Indeed, ease and quiet, and
the study of pleasant and speculative learning, to an old man retiring
from command and office, is a most suitable and becoming solace; but
to misguide virtuous actions to pleasure as their utmost end, and
as the conclusion of campaigns and commands, to keep the feast of
Venus, did not become the noble Academy, and the follower of Xenocrates,
but rather one that inclined to Epicurus. And this is one surprising
point of contrast between them; Cimon's youth was ill reputed and
intemperate, Lucullus's well disciplined and sober. Undoubtedly we
must give the preference to the change for good, for it argues the
better nature, where vice declines and virtue grows. Both had great
wealth, but employed it in different ways; and there is no comparison
between the south wall of the acropolis built by Cimon, and the chambers
and galleries, with their sea-views, built at Naples by Lucullus,
out of the spoils of the barbarians. Neither can we compare Cimon's
popular and liberal table with the sumptuous oriental one of Lucullus,
the former receiving a great many guests every day at small cost,
and the latter expensively spread for a few men of pleasure, unless
you will say that different times made the alteration. For who can
tell but that Cimon, if he had retired in his old age from business
and war to quiet and solitude, might have lived a more luxurious and
self-indulgent life, as he was fond of wine and company, and accused,
as has been said, of laxity with women? The better pleasures gained
in successful action and effort leave the baser appetites no time
or place, and make active and heroic men forget them. Had but Lucullus
ended his days in the field, and in command, envy and detraction itself
could never have accused him. So much for their manner of life.

In war, it is plain they were both soldiers of excellent conduct,
both at land and sea. But as in the games they honour those champions
who on the same day gain the garland, both in wrestling and in the
pancratium, with the name of "Victors and more," so Cimon, honouring
Greece with a sea and land victory on the same day, may claim a certain
pre-eminence among commanders. Lucullus received command from his
country, whereas Cimon brought it to his. He annexed the territories
of enemies to her, who ruled over confederates before, but Cimon made
his country, which when he began was a mere follower of others, both
rule over confederates, and conquer enemies too, forcing the Persians
to relinquish the sea, and inducing the Lacedaemonians to surrender
their command. If it be the chiefest thing in a general to obtain
the obedience of his soldiers by good-will, Lucullus was despised
by his own army, but Cimon highly prized even by others. His soldiers
deserted the one, the confederates came over to the other. Lucullus
came home without the forces which he led out; Cimon, sent out at
first to serve as one confederate among others, returned home with
authority even over these also, having successfully effected for his
city three most difficult services, establishing peace with the enemy,
dominion over confederates, and concord with Lacedaemon. Both aiming
to destroy great kingdoms, and subdue all Asia, failed in their enterprise,
Cimon by a simple piece of ill-fortune, for he died when general,
in the height of success; but Lucullus no man can wholly acquit of
being in fault with his soldiers, whether it were he did not know,
or would not comply with, the distastes and complaints of his army,
which brought him at last into such extreme unpopularity among them.
But did not Cimon also suffer like him in this? For the citizens arraigned
him, and did not leave off till they had banished him, that, as Plato
says, they might not hear him for the space of ten years. For high
and noble minds seldom please the vulgar, or are acceptable to them;
for the force they use to straighten their distorted actions gives
the same pain as surgeons' bandages do in bringing dislocated bones
to their natural position. Both of them, perhaps, come off pretty
much with an equal acquittal on this count. 

Lucullus very much outwent him in war, being the first Roman who carried
an army over Taurus, passed the Tigris, took and burned the royal
palaces of Asia in the sight of the kings, Tigranocerta, Cabira, Sinope,
and Nisibis, seizing and overwhelming the northern parts as far as
the Phasis, the east as far as Media, and making the South and Red
Sea his own through the kings of the Arabians. He shattered the power
of the kings, and narrowly missed their persons, while like wild beasts
they fled away into deserts and thick and impassable woods. In demonstration
of this superiority, we see that the Persians, as if no great harm
had befallen them under Cimon, soon after appeared in arms against
the Greeks, and overcame and destroyed their numerous forces in Egypt.
But after Lucullus, Tigranes and Mithridates were able to do nothing;
the latter, being disabled and broken in the former wars, never dared
to show his army to Pompey outside the camp, but fled away to Bosporus,
and there died. Tigranes threw himself, naked and unarmed, down before
Pompey, and taking his crown from his head laid it at his feet, complimenting
Pompey with what was not his own, but, in real truth, the conquest
already effected by Lucullus. And when he received the ensigns of
majesty again, he was well pleased, evidently because he had forfeited
them before. And the commander, as the wrestler, is to be accounted
to have done most who leaves an adversary almost conquered for his
successor. Cimon moreover, when he took the command, found the power
of the king broken, and the spirits of the Persians humbled by their
great defeats and incessant routs under Themistocles, Pausanias, and
Leontychides, and thus easily overcame the bodies of men whose souls
were quelled and defeated beforehand. But Tigranes had never yet in
many combats been beaten, and was flushed with success when he engaged
with Lucullus. There is no comparison between the numbers which came
against Lucullus and those subdued by Cimon. All which things being
rightly considered, it is a hard matter to give judgment. For supernatural
favour also appears to have attended both of them, directing the one
what to do, the other what to avoid, and thus they have, both of them,
so to say, the vote of the gods, to declare them noble and divine
characters.
