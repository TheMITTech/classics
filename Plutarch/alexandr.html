<A NAME="2"></A>
<BR>(died 323 B.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>IT being my purpose to write the lives of Alexander the king, and of Caesar, 
<A NAME="11"></A>by whom Pompey was destroyed, the multitude of their great actions affords 
<A NAME="12"></A>so large a field that I were to blame if I should not by way of apology 
<A NAME="13"></A>forewarn my reader that I have chosen rather to epitomize the most celebrated 
<A NAME="14"></A>parts of their story, than to insist at large on every particular circumstance 
<A NAME="15"></A>of it. It must be borne in mind that my design is not to write histories, 
<A NAME="16"></A>but lives. And the most glorious exploits do not always furnish us with 
<A NAME="17"></A>the clearest discoveries of virtue or vice in men; sometimes a matter of 
<A NAME="18"></A>less moment, an expression or a jest, informs us better of their characters 
<A NAME="19"></A>and inclinations, than the most famous sieges, the greatest armaments, 
<A NAME="20"></A>or the bloodiest battles whatsoever. Therefore as portrait-painters are 
<A NAME="21"></A>more exact in the lines and features of the face, in which the character 
<A NAME="22"></A>is seen, than in the other parts of the body, so I must be allowed to give 
<A NAME="23"></A>my more particular attention to the marks and indications of the souls 
<A NAME="24"></A>of men, and while I endeavour by these to portray their lives, may be free 
<A NAME="25"></A>to leave more weighty matters and great battles to be treated of by 
<A NAME="26"></A>others.
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR>It is agreed on by all hands, that on the father's side, Alexander 
<A NAME="28"></A>descended from Hercules by Caranus, and from Aeacus by Neoptolemus on the 
<A NAME="29"></A>mother's side. His father Philip, being in Samothrace, when he was quite 
<A NAME="30"></A>young, fell in love there with Olympias, in company with whom he was initiated 
<A NAME="31"></A>in the religious ceremonies of the country, and her father and mother being 
<A NAME="32"></A>both dead, soon after, with the consent of her brother, Arymbas, he married 
<A NAME="33"></A>her. The night before the consummation of their marriage, she dreamed that 
<A NAME="34"></A>a thunderbolt fell upon her body, which kindled a great fire, whose divided 
<A NAME="35"></A>flames dispersed themselves all about, and then were extinguished. And 
<A NAME="36"></A>Philip, some time after he was married, dreamt that he sealed up his wife's 
<A NAME="37"></A>body with a seal, whose impression, as be fancied, was the figure of a 
<A NAME="38"></A>lion. Some of the diviners interpreted this as a warning to Philip to look 
<A NAME="39"></A>narrowly to his wife; but Aristander of Telmessus, considering how unusual 
<A NAME="40"></A>it was to seal up anything that was empty, assured him the meaning of his 
<A NAME="41"></A>dream was that the queen was with child of a boy, who would one day prove 
<A NAME="42"></A>as stout and courageous as a lion. Once, moreover, a serpent was found 
<A NAME="43"></A>lying by Olympias as she slept, which more than anything else, it is said, 
<A NAME="44"></A>abated Philip's passion for her; and whether he feared her as an enchantress, 
<A NAME="45"></A>or thought she had commerce with some god, and so looked on himself as 
<A NAME="46"></A>excluded, he was ever after less fond of her conversation. Others say, 
<A NAME="47"></A>that the women of this country having always been extremely addicted to 
<A NAME="48"></A>the enthusiastic Orphic rites, and the wild worship of Bacchus (upon which 
<A NAME="49"></A>account they were called Clodones, and Mimallones), imitated in many things 
<A NAME="50"></A>the practices of the Edonian and Thracian women about Mount Haemus, from 
<A NAME="51"></A>whom the word threskeuein seems to have been derived, as a special term 
<A NAME="52"></A>for superfluous and over-curious forms of adoration; and that Olympias, 
<A NAME="53"></A>zealously, affecting these fanatical and enthusiastic inspirations, to 
<A NAME="54"></A>perform them with more barbaric dread, was wont in the dances proper to 
<A NAME="55"></A>these ceremonies to have great tame serpents about her, which sometimes 
<A NAME="56"></A>creeping out of the ivy in the mystic fans, sometimes winding themselves 
<A NAME="57"></A>about the sacred spears, and the women's chaplets, made a spectacle which 
<A NAME="58"></A>men could not look upon without terror.
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR>Philip, after this vision, sent Chaeron of Megalopolis to consult 
<A NAME="60"></A>the oracle of Apollo at Delphi, by which he was commanded to perform sacrifice, 
<A NAME="61"></A>and henceforth pay particular honour, above all other gods, to Ammon; and 
<A NAME="62"></A>was told he should one day lose that eye with which he presumed to peep 
<A NAME="63"></A>through that chink of the door, when he saw the god, under the form of 
<A NAME="64"></A>a serpent, in the company of his wife. Eratosthenes says that Olympias, 
<A NAME="65"></A>when she attended Alexander on his way to the army in his first expedition, 
<A NAME="66"></A>told him the secret of his birth, and bade him behave himself with courage 
<A NAME="67"></A>suitable to his divine extraction. Others again affirm that she wholly 
<A NAME="68"></A>disclaimed any pretensions of the kind, and was wont to say, "When will 
<A NAME="69"></A>Alexander leave off slandering me to Juno?"
<A NAME="70"></A><BR><BR>Alexander was born the sixth of Hecatombaeon, which month the Macedonians 
<A NAME="71"></A>call Lous, the same day that the temple of Diana at Ephesus was burnt; 
<A NAME="72"></A>which Hegesias of Magnesia makes the occasion of a conceit, frigid enough 
<A NAME="73"></A>to have stopped the conflagration. The temple, he says, took fire and was 
<A NAME="74"></A>burnt while its mistress was absent, assisting at the birth of Alexander. 
<A NAME="75"></A>And all the Eastern soothsayers who happened to be then at Ephesus, looking 
<A NAME="76"></A>upon the ruin of this temple to be the forerunner of some other calamity, 
<A NAME="77"></A>ran about the town, beating their faces, and crying that this day had brought 
<A NAME="78"></A>forth something that would prove fatal and destructive to all 
<A NAME="79"></A>Asia.
<A NAME="80"></A><BR><BR>Just after Philip had taken Potidaea, he received these three messages 
<A NAME="81"></A>at one time, that Parmenio had overthrown the Illyrians in a great battle, 
<A NAME="82"></A>that his race-horse had won the course at the Olympic games, and that his 
<A NAME="83"></A>wife had given birth to Alexander; with which being naturally well pleased, 
<A NAME="84"></A>as an addition to his satisfaction, he was assured by the diviners that 
<A NAME="85"></A>a son, whose birth was accompanied with three such successes, could not 
<A NAME="86"></A>fail of being invincible.
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR>The statues that gave the best representation of Alexander's person 
<A NAME="88"></A>were those of Lysippus (by whom alone he would suffer his image to be made), 
<A NAME="89"></A>those peculiarities which many of his successors afterwards and his friends 
<A NAME="90"></A>used to affect to imitate, the inclination of his head a little on one 
<A NAME="91"></A>side towards his left shoulder, and his melting eye, having been expressed 
<A NAME="92"></A>by this artist with great exactness. But Apelles, who drew him with thunderbolts 
<A NAME="93"></A>in his hand, made his complexion browner and darker than it was naturally; 
<A NAME="94"></A>for he was fair and of a light colour, passing into ruddiness in his face 
<A NAME="95"></A>and upon his breast. Aristoxenus in his Memoirs tells us that a most agreeable 
<A NAME="96"></A>odour exhaled from his skin, and that his breath and body all over was 
<A NAME="97"></A>so fragrant as to perfume the clothes which he wore next him; the cause 
<A NAME="98"></A>of which might probably be the hot and adust temperament of his body. For 
<A NAME="99"></A>sweet smells, Theophrastus conceives, are produced by the concoction of 
<A NAME="100"></A>moist humours by heat, which is the reason that those parts of the world 
<A NAME="101"></A>which are driest and most burnt up afford spices of the best kind and in 
<A NAME="102"></A>the greatest quantity; for the heat of the sun exhausts all the superfluous 
<A NAME="103"></A>moisture which lies in the surface of bodies, ready to generate putrefaction. 
<A NAME="104"></A>And this hot constitution, it may be, rendered Alexander so addicted to 
<A NAME="105"></A>drinking, and so choleric. His temperance, as to the pleasures of the body, 
<A NAME="106"></A>was apparent in him in his very childhood, as he was with much difficulty 
<A NAME="107"></A>incited to them, and always used them with great moderation; though in 
<A NAME="108"></A>other things be was extremely eager and vehement, and in his love of glory, 
<A NAME="109"></A>and the pursuit of it, he showed a solidity of high spirit and magnanimity 
<A NAME="110"></A>far above his age. For he neither sought nor valued it upon every occasion, 
<A NAME="111"></A>as his father Philip did (who affected to show his eloquence almost to 
<A NAME="112"></A>a degree of pedantry, and took care to have the victories of his racing 
<A NAME="113"></A>chariots at the Olympic games engraven on his coin), but when he was asked 
<A NAME="114"></A>by some about him, whether he would run a race in the Olympic games, as 
<A NAME="115"></A>he was very swift-footed, he answered, he would, if he might have kings 
<A NAME="116"></A>to run with him. Indeed, he seems in general to have looked with indifference, 
<A NAME="117"></A>if not with dislike, upon the professed athletes. He often appointed prizes, 
<A NAME="118"></A>for which not only tragedians and musicians, pipers and harpers, but rhapsodists 
<A NAME="119"></A>also, strove to outvie one another; and delighted in all manner of hunting 
<A NAME="120"></A>and cudgel-playing, but never gave any encouragement to contests either 
<A NAME="121"></A>of boxing or of the pancratium.
<A NAME="122"></A><BR><BR>While he was yet very young, he entertained the ambassadors from 
<A NAME="123"></A>the King of Persia, in the absence of his father, and entering much into 
<A NAME="124"></A>conversation with them, gained so much upon them by his affability, and 
<A NAME="125"></A>the questions he asked them, which were far from being childish or trifling 
<A NAME="126"></A>(for he inquired of them the length of the ways, the nature of the road 
<A NAME="127"></A>into inner Asia, the character of their king, how he carried himself to 
<A NAME="128"></A>his enemies, and what forces he was able to bring into the field), that 
<A NAME="129"></A>they were struck with admiration of him, and looked upon the ability so 
<A NAME="130"></A>much famed of Philip to be nothing in comparison with the forwardness and 
<A NAME="131"></A>high purpose that appeared thus early in his son. Whenever he heard Philip 
<A NAME="132"></A>had taken any town of importance, or won any signal victory, instead of 
<A NAME="133"></A>rejoicing at it altogether, he would tell his companions that his father 
<A NAME="134"></A>would anticipate everything, and leave him and them no opportunities of 
<A NAME="135"></A>performing great and illustrious actions. For being more bent upon action 
<A NAME="136"></A>and glory than either upon pleasure or riches, he esteemed all that he 
<A NAME="137"></A>should receive from his father as a diminution and prevention of his own 
<A NAME="138"></A>future achievements; and would have chosen rather to succeed to a kingdom 
<A NAME="139"></A>involved in troubles and wars, which would have afforded him frequent exercise 
<A NAME="140"></A>of his courage, and a large field of honour, than to one already flourishing 
<A NAME="141"></A>and settled, where his inheritance would be an inactive life, and the mere 
<A NAME="142"></A>enjoyment of wealth and luxury.
<A NAME="143"></A><BR><BR>The care of his education, as it might be presumed, was committed 
<A NAME="144"></A>to a great many attendants, preceptors, and teachers, over the whole of 
<A NAME="145"></A>whom Leonidas, a near kinsman of Olympias, a man of an austere temper, 
<A NAME="146"></A>presided, who did not indeed himself decline the name of what in reality 
<A NAME="147"></A>is a noble and honourable office, but in general his dignity, and his near 
<A NAME="148"></A>relationship, obtained him from other people the title of Alexander's foster-father 
<A NAME="149"></A>and governor. But he who took upon him the actual place and style of his 
<A NAME="150"></A>pedagogue was Lysimachus the Acarnanian, who, though he had nothing to 
<A NAME="151"></A>recommend him, but his lucky fancy of calling himself Phoenix, Alexander 
<A NAME="152"></A>Achilles and Philip Peleus, was therefore well enough esteemed, and ranked 
<A NAME="153"></A>in the next degree after Leonidas.
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR>Philonicus the Thessalian brought the horse Bucephalus to Philip, 
<A NAME="155"></A>offering to sell him for thirteen talents; but when they went into the 
<A NAME="156"></A>field to try him, they found him so very vicious and unmanageable, that 
<A NAME="157"></A>he reared up when they endeavoured to mount him, and would not so much 
<A NAME="158"></A>as endure the voice of any of Philip's attendants. Upon which, as they 
<A NAME="159"></A>were leading him away as wholly useless and untractable, Alexander, who 
<A NAME="160"></A>stood by, said, "What an excellent horse do they lose for want of address 
<A NAME="161"></A>and boldness to manage him!" Philip at first took no notice of what he 
<A NAME="162"></A>said; but when he heard him repeat the same thing several times, and saw 
<A NAME="163"></A>he was much vexed to see the horse sent away, "Do you reproach," said he 
<A NAME="164"></A>to him, "those who are older than yourself, as if you knew more, and were 
<A NAME="165"></A>better able to manage him than they?" "I could manage this horse," replied 
<A NAME="166"></A>he, "better than others do." "And if you do not," said Philip, "what will 
<A NAME="167"></A>you forfeit for your rashness?" "I will pay," answered Alexander, "the 
<A NAME="168"></A>whole price of the horse." At this the whole company fell a-laughing; and 
<A NAME="169"></A>as soon as the wager was settled amongst them, he immediately ran to the 
<A NAME="170"></A>horse, and taking hold of the bridle, turned him directly towards the sun, 
<A NAME="171"></A>having, it seems, observed that he was disturbed at and afraid of the motion 
<A NAME="172"></A>of his own shadow; then letting him go forward a little, still keeping 
<A NAME="173"></A>the reins in his hands, and stroking him gently when he found him begin 
<A NAME="174"></A>to grow eager and fiery, he let fall his upper garment softly, and with 
<A NAME="175"></A>one nimble leap securely mounted him, and when he was seated, by little 
<A NAME="176"></A>and little drew in the bridle, and curbed him without either striking or 
<A NAME="177"></A>spurring him. Presently, when he found him free from all rebelliousness, 
<A NAME="178"></A>and only impatient for the course, he let him go at full speed, inciting 
<A NAME="179"></A>him now with a commanding voice, and urging him also with his heel. Philip 
<A NAME="180"></A>and his friends looked on at first in silence and anxiety for the result, 
<A NAME="181"></A>till seeing him turn at the end of his career, and come back rejoicing 
<A NAME="182"></A>and triumphing for what he had performed, they all burst out into acclamations 
<A NAME="183"></A>of applause; and his father shedding tears, it is said, for joy, kissed 
<A NAME="184"></A>him as he came down from his horse, and in his transport said, "O my son, 
<A NAME="185"></A>look thee out a kingdom equal to and worthy of thyself, for Macedonia is 
<A NAME="186"></A>too little for thee."
<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR>After this, considering him to be of a temper easy to be led to 
<A NAME="188"></A>his duty by reason, but by no means to be compelled, he always endeavoured 
<A NAME="189"></A>to persuade rather than to command or force him to anything; and now looking 
<A NAME="190"></A>upon the instruction and tuition of his youth to be of greater difficulty 
<A NAME="191"></A>and importance than to be wholly trusted to the ordinary masters in music 
<A NAME="192"></A>and poetry, and the common school subjects, and to require, as Sophocles 
<A NAME="193"></A>says-
<A NAME="194"></A><BR><BR>"The bridle and the rudder too," he sent for Aristotle, the most 
<A NAME="195"></A>learned and most celebrated philosopher of his time, and rewarded him with 
<A NAME="196"></A>a munificence proportionable to and becoming the care he took to instruct 
<A NAME="197"></A>his son. For he repeopled his native city Stagira, which he had caused 
<A NAME="198"></A>to be demolished a little before, and restored all the citizens, who were 
<A NAME="199"></A>in exile or slavery, to their habitations. As a place for the pursuit of 
<A NAME="200"></A>their studies and exercise, he assigned the temple of the Nymphs, near 
<A NAME="201"></A>Mieza, where, to this very day, they show you Aristotle's stone seats, 
<A NAME="202"></A>and the shady walks which he was wont to frequent. It would appear that 
<A NAME="203"></A>Alexander received from him not only his doctrines of Morals and of Politics, 
<A NAME="204"></A>but also something of those more abstruse and profound theories which these 
<A NAME="205"></A>philosophers, by the very names they gave them, professed to reserve for 
<A NAME="206"></A>oral communication to the initiated, and did not allow many to become acquainted 
<A NAME="207"></A>with. For when he was in Asia, and heard Aristotle had published some treatises 
<A NAME="208"></A>of that kind, he wrote to him, using very plain language to him in behalf 
<A NAME="209"></A>of philosophy, the following letter. "Alexander to Aristotle, greeting. 
<A NAME="210"></A>You have not done well to publish your books of oral doctrine; for what 
<A NAME="211"></A>is there now that we excel others in, if those things which we have been 
<A NAME="212"></A>particularly instructed in be laid open to all? For my part, I assure you, 
<A NAME="213"></A>I had rather excel others in the knowledge of what is excellent, than in 
<A NAME="214"></A>the extent of my power and dominion. Farewell." And Aristotle, soothing 
<A NAME="215"></A>this passion for pre-eminence, speaks, in his excuse for himself, of these 
<A NAME="216"></A>doctrines as in fact both published and not published: as indeed, to say 
<A NAME="217"></A>the truth, his books on metaphysics are written in a style which makes 
<A NAME="218"></A>them useless for ordinary teaching, and instructive only, in the way of 
<A NAME="219"></A>memoranda, for those who have been already conversant in that sort of 
<A NAME="220"></A>learning.
<A NAME="221"></A><BR><BR>Doubtless also it was to Aristotle that he owed the inclination 
<A NAME="222"></A>he had, not to the theory only, but likewise to the practice of the art 
<A NAME="223"></A>of medicine. For when any of his friends were sick, he would often prescribe 
<A NAME="224"></A>them their course of diet, and medicines proper to their disease, as we 
<A NAME="225"></A>may find in his epistles. He was naturally a great lover of all kinds of 
<A NAME="226"></A>learning and reading; and Onesicritus informs us that he constantly laid 
<A NAME="227"></A>Homer's Iliads, according to the copy corrected by Aristotle, called the 
<A NAME="228"></A>casket copy, with his dagger under his pillow, declaring that he esteemed 
<A NAME="229"></A>it a perfect portable treasure of all military virtue and knowledge. When 
<A NAME="230"></A>he was in the upper Asia, being destitute of other books, he ordered Harpalus 
<A NAME="231"></A>to send him some; who furnished him with Philistus's History, a great many 
<A NAME="232"></A>of the plays of Euripides, Sophocles, and Aeschylus, and some dithyrambic 
<A NAME="233"></A>odes, composed by Telestes and Philoxenus. For a while he loved and cherished 
<A NAME="234"></A>Aristotle no less, as he was wont to say himself, than if he had been his 
<A NAME="235"></A>father, giving this reason for it, that as he had received life from the 
<A NAME="236"></A>one, so the other had taught him to live well. But afterwards, upon some 
<A NAME="237"></A>mistrust of him, yet not so great as to make him do him any hurt, his familiarity 
<A NAME="238"></A>and friendly kindness to him abated so much of its former force and affectionateness, 
<A NAME="239"></A>as to make it evident he was alienated from him. However, his violent thirst 
<A NAME="240"></A>after and passion for learning, which were once implanted, still grew up 
<A NAME="241"></A>with him, and never decayed; as appears by his veneration of Anaxarchus, 
<A NAME="242"></A>by the present of fifty talents which he sent to Xenocrates, and his particular 
<A NAME="243"></A>care and esteem of Dandamis and Calanus.
<A NAME="244"></A><BR><BR>While Philip went on his expedition against the Byzantines, he 
<A NAME="245"></A>left Alexander, then sixteen years old, his lieutenant in Macedonia, committing 
<A NAME="246"></A>the charge of his seal to him; who, not to sit idle, reduced the rebellious 
<A NAME="247"></A>Maedi, and having taken their chief town by storm, drove out the barbarous 
<A NAME="248"></A>inhabitants, and planting a colony of several nations in their room, called 
<A NAME="249"></A>the place after his own name, Alexandropolis. At the battle of Chaeronea, 
<A NAME="250"></A>which his father fought against the Grecians, he is said to have been the 
<A NAME="251"></A>first man that charged the Thebans' sacred band. And even in my remembrance, 
<A NAME="252"></A>there stood an old oak near the river Cephisus, which people called Alexander's 
<A NAME="253"></A>oak, because his tent was pitched under it. And not far off are to be seen 
<A NAME="254"></A>the graves of the Macedonians who fell in that battle. This early bravery 
<A NAME="255"></A>made Philip so fond of him, that nothing pleased him more than to hear 
<A NAME="256"></A>his subjects call himself their general and Alexander their 
<A NAME="257"></A>king.
<A NAME="258"></A><BR><BR>But the disorders of his family, chiefly caused by his new marriages 
<A NAME="259"></A>and attachments (the troubles that began in the women's chambers spreading, 
<A NAME="260"></A>so to say, to the whole kingdom), raised various complaints and differences 
<A NAME="261"></A>between them, which the violence of Olympias, a woman of a jealous and 
<A NAME="262"></A>implacable temper, made wider, by exasperating Alexander against his father. 
<A NAME="263"></A>Among the rest, this accident contributed most to their falling out. At 
<A NAME="264"></A>the wedding of Cleopatra, whom Philip fell in love with and married, she 
<A NAME="265"></A>being much too young for him, her uncle Attalus in his drink desired the 
<A NAME="266"></A>Macedonians would implore the gods to give them a lawful successor to the 
<A NAME="267"></A>kingdom by his niece. This so irritated Alexander, that throwing one of 
<A NAME="268"></A>the cups at his head, "You villain," said he, "what, am I then a bastard?" 
<A NAME="269"></A>Then Philip, taking Attalus's part, rose up and would have run his son 
<A NAME="270"></A>through; but by good fortune for them both, either his over-hasty rage, 
<A NAME="271"></A>or the wine he had drunk, made his foot slip, so that he fell down on the 
<A NAME="272"></A>floor. At which Alexander reproachfully insulted over him: "See there," 
<A NAME="273"></A>said he, "the man who makes preparations to pass out of Europe into Asia, 
<A NAME="274"></A>overturned in passing from one seat to another." After this debauch, he 
<A NAME="275"></A>and his mother Olympias withdrew from Philip's company, and when he had 
<A NAME="276"></A>placed her in Epirus, he himself retired into Illyria.
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR>About this time, Demaratus the Corinthian, an old friend of the 
<A NAME="278"></A>family, who had the freedom to say anything among them without offence, 
<A NAME="279"></A>coming to visit Philip, after the first compliments and embraces were over, 
<A NAME="280"></A>Philip asked him whether the Grecians were at amity with one another. "It 
<A NAME="281"></A>ill becomes you," replied Demaratus, "to be so solicitous about Greece, 
<A NAME="282"></A>when you have involved your own house in so many dissensions and calamities." 
<A NAME="283"></A>He was so convinced by this seasonable reproach, that he immediately sent 
<A NAME="284"></A>for his son home, and by Demaratus's mediation prevailed with him to return. 
<A NAME="285"></A>But this reconciliation lasted not long; for when Pixodorus, viceroy of 
<A NAME="286"></A>Caria, sent Aristocritus to treat for a match between his eldest daughter 
<A NAME="287"></A>and Philip's son, Arrhidaeus, hoping by this alliance to secure his assistance 
<A NAME="288"></A>upon occasion, Alexander's mother, and some who pretended to be his friends, 
<A NAME="289"></A>presently filled his head with tales and calumnies, as if Philip, by a 
<A NAME="290"></A>splendid marriage and important alliance, were preparing the way for settling 
<A NAME="291"></A>the kingdom upon Arrhidaeus. In alarm at this, he despatched Thessalus, 
<A NAME="292"></A>the tragic actor, into Caria, to dispose Pixodorus to slight Arrhidaeus, 
<A NAME="293"></A>both illegitimate and a fool, and rather to accept of himself for his son-in-law. 
<A NAME="294"></A>This proposition was much more agreeable to Pixodorus than the former. 
<A NAME="295"></A>But Philip, as soon as he was made acquainted with this transaction, went 
<A NAME="296"></A>to his son's apartment, taking with him Philotas, the son of Parmenio, 
<A NAME="297"></A>one of Alexander's intimate friends and companions, and there reproved 
<A NAME="298"></A>him severely, and reproached him bitterly, that he should be so degenerate, 
<A NAME="299"></A>and unworthy of the power he was to leave him, as to desire the alliance 
<A NAME="300"></A>of a mean Carian, who was at best but the slave of a barbarous prince. 
<A NAME="301"></A>Nor did this satisfy his resentment, for he wrote to the Corinthians to 
<A NAME="302"></A>send Thessalus to him in chains, and banished Harpalus, Nearchus, Erigyius, 
<A NAME="303"></A>and Ptolemy, his son's friends and favourites, whom Alexander afterwards 
<A NAME="304"></A>recalled and raised to great honour and preferment.
<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR>Not long after this, Pausanias, having had an outrage done to him 
<A NAME="306"></A>at the instance of Attalus and Cleopatra, when he found he could get no 
<A NAME="307"></A>reparation for his disgrace at Philip's hands, watched his opportunity 
<A NAME="308"></A>and murdered him. The guilt of which fact was laid for the most part upon 
<A NAME="309"></A>Olympias, who was said to have encouraged and exasperated the enraged youth 
<A NAME="310"></A>to revenge; and some sort of suspicion attached even to Alexander himself, 
<A NAME="311"></A>who, it was said, when Pausanias came and complained to him of the injury 
<A NAME="312"></A>he had received, repeated the verse out of Euripides's 
<A NAME="313"></A>Medea-
<A NAME="314"></A><BR><BR>"On husband, and on father, and on bride." However, he took care 
<A NAME="315"></A>to find out and punish the accomplices of the conspiracy severely, and 
<A NAME="316"></A>was very angry with Olympias for treating Cleopatra inhumanly in his 
<A NAME="317"></A>absence.
<A NAME="318"></A><BR><BR>Alexander was but twenty years old when his father was murdered, 
<A NAME="319"></A>and succeeded to a kingdom, beset on all sides with great dangers and rancorous 
<A NAME="320"></A>enemies. For not only the barbarous nations that bordered on Macedonia 
<A NAME="321"></A>were impatient of being governed by any but their own native princes, but 
<A NAME="322"></A>Philip likewise, though he had been victorious over the Grecians, yet, 
<A NAME="323"></A>as the time had not been sufficient for him to complete his conquest and 
<A NAME="324"></A>accustom them to his sway, had simply left all things in a general disorder 
<A NAME="325"></A>and confusion. It seemed to the Macedonians a very critical time; and some 
<A NAME="326"></A>would have persuaded Alexander to give up all thought of retaining the 
<A NAME="327"></A>Grecians in subjection by force of arms, and rather to apply himself to 
<A NAME="328"></A>win back by gentle means the allegiance of the tribes who were designing 
<A NAME="329"></A>revolt, and try the effect of indulgence in arresting the first motions 
<A NAME="330"></A>towards revolution. But he rejected this counsel as weak and timorous, 
<A NAME="331"></A>and looked upon it to be more prudence to secure himself by resolution 
<A NAME="332"></A>and magnanimity, than, by seeming to truckle to any, to encourage all to 
<A NAME="333"></A>trample on him. In pursuit of this opinion, he reduced the barbarians to 
<A NAME="334"></A>tranquillity, and put an end to all fear of war from them, he gave rapid 
<A NAME="335"></A>expedition into their country as far as the river Danube, where he gave 
<A NAME="336"></A>Syrmus, King of the Triballians, an entire overthrow. And hearing the Thebans 
<A NAME="337"></A>were in revolt, and the Athenians in correspondence with them, he immediately 
<A NAME="338"></A>marched through the pass of Thermopylae, saying that to Demosthenes, who 
<A NAME="339"></A>had called him a child while he was in Illyria and in the country of the 
<A NAME="340"></A>Triballians, and a youth when he was in Thessaly, he would appear a man 
<A NAME="341"></A>before the walls of Athens.
<A NAME="342"></A><BR><BR>When he came to Thebes, to show how willing he was to accept of 
<A NAME="343"></A>their repentance for what was past, he only demanded of them Phoenix and 
<A NAME="344"></A>Prothytes, the authors of the rebellion, and proclaimed a general pardon 
<A NAME="345"></A>to those who would come over to him. But when the Thebans merely retorted 
<A NAME="346"></A>by demanding Philotas and Antipater to be delivered into their hands, and 
<A NAME="347"></A>by a proclamation on their part invited all who would assert the liberty 
<A NAME="348"></A>of Greece to come over to them, he presently applied himself to make them 
<A NAME="349"></A>feel the last extremities of war. The Thebans indeed defended themselves 
<A NAME="350"></A>with a zeal and courage beyond their strength, being much outnumbered by 
<A NAME="351"></A>their enemies. But when the Macedonian garrison sallied out upon them from 
<A NAME="352"></A>the citadel, they were so hemmed in on all sides that the greater part 
<A NAME="353"></A>of them fell in the battle; the city itself being taken by storm, was sacked 
<A NAME="354"></A>and razed. Alexander's hope being that so severe an example might terrify 
<A NAME="355"></A>the rest of Greece into obedience, and also in order to gratify the hostility 
<A NAME="356"></A>of his confederates, the Phocians and Plataeans. So that, except the priests, 
<A NAME="357"></A>and some few who had heretofore been the friends and connections of the 
<A NAME="358"></A>Macedonians, the family of the poet Pindar, and those who were known to 
<A NAME="359"></A>have opposed the public vote for the war, all the rest, to the number of 
<A NAME="360"></A>thirty thousand, were publicly sold for slaves; and it is computed that 
<A NAME="361"></A>upwards of six thousand were put to the sword.
<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR>Among the other calamities that befell the city, it happened that 
<A NAME="363"></A>some Thracian soldiers, having broken into the house of a matron of high 
<A NAME="364"></A>character and repute, named Timoclea, their captain, after he had used 
<A NAME="365"></A>violence with her, to satisfy his avarice as well as lust, asked her, if 
<A NAME="366"></A>she knew of any money concealed; to which she readily answered she did, 
<A NAME="367"></A>and bade him follow her into a garden, where she showed him a well, into 
<A NAME="368"></A>which, she told him, upon the taking of the city, she had thrown what she 
<A NAME="369"></A>had of most value. The greedy Thracian presently stooping down to view 
<A NAME="370"></A>the place where he thought the treasure lay, she came behind him and pushed 
<A NAME="371"></A>him into the well, and then flung great stones in upon him, till she had 
<A NAME="372"></A>killed him. After which, when the soldiers led her away bound to Alexander, 
<A NAME="373"></A>her very mien and gait showed her to be a woman of dignity, and of a mind 
<A NAME="374"></A>no less elevated, not betraying the least sign of fear or astonishment. 
<A NAME="375"></A>And when the king asked her who she was, "I am," said she, "the sister 
<A NAME="376"></A>of Theagenes, who fought the battle of Chaeronea with your father Philip, 
<A NAME="377"></A>and fell there in command for the liberty of Greece." Alexander was so 
<A NAME="378"></A>surprised, both at what she had done and what she said, that he could not 
<A NAME="379"></A>choose but give her and her children their freedom to go whither they 
<A NAME="380"></A>pleased.
<A NAME="381"></A><BR><BR>After this he received the Athenians into favour, although they 
<A NAME="382"></A>had shown themselves so much concerned at the calamity of Thebes that out 
<A NAME="383"></A>of sorrow they omitted the celebration of the Mysteries, and entertained 
<A NAME="384"></A>those who escaped with all possible humanity. Whether it were, like the 
<A NAME="385"></A>lion, that his passion was now satisfied, or that, after an example of 
<A NAME="386"></A>extreme cruelty, he had a mind to appear merciful, it happened well for 
<A NAME="387"></A>the Athenians; for he not only forgave them all past offences, but bade 
<A NAME="388"></A>them look to their affairs with vigilance, remembering that if he should 
<A NAME="389"></A>miscarry, they were likely to be the arbiters of Greece. Certain it is, 
<A NAME="390"></A>too, that in aftertime he often repented of his severity to the Thebans, 
<A NAME="391"></A>and his remorse had such influence on his temper as to make him ever after 
<A NAME="392"></A>less rigorous to all others. He imputed also the murder of Clitus, which 
<A NAME="393"></A>he committed in his wine, and the unwillingness of the Macedonians to follow 
<A NAME="394"></A>him against the Indians, by which his enterprise and glory was left imperfect, 
<A NAME="395"></A>to the wrath and vengeance of Bacchus, the protector of Thebes. And it 
<A NAME="396"></A>was observed that whatsoever any Theban, who had the good fortune to survive 
<A NAME="397"></A>this victory, asked of him, he was sure to grant without the least 
<A NAME="398"></A>difficulty.
<A NAME="399"></A><BR><BR>Soon after, the Grecians, being assembled at the Isthmus, declared 
<A NAME="400"></A>their resolution of joining with Alexander in the war against the Persians, 
<A NAME="401"></A>and proclaimed him their general. While he stayed here, many public ministers 
<A NAME="402"></A>and philosophers came from all parts to visit him and congratulated him 
<A NAME="403"></A>on his election, but contrary to his expectation, Diogenes of Sinope, who 
<A NAME="404"></A>then was living at Corinth, thought so little of him, that instead of coming 
<A NAME="405"></A>to compliment him, he never so much as stirred out of the suburb called 
<A NAME="406"></A>the Cranium, where Alexander found him lying along in the sun. When he 
<A NAME="407"></A>saw so much company near him, he raised himself a little, and vouchsafed 
<A NAME="408"></A>to look upon Alexander; and when he kindly asked him whether he wanted 
<A NAME="409"></A>anything, "Yes," said he, "I would have you stand from between me and the 
<A NAME="410"></A>sun." Alexander was so struck at this answer, and surprised at the greatness 
<A NAME="411"></A>of the man, who had taken so little notice of him, that as he went away 
<A NAME="412"></A>he told his followers, who were laughing at the moroseness of the philosopher, 
<A NAME="413"></A>that if he were not Alexander, he would choose to be 
<A NAME="414"></A>Diogenes.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR><BR>Then he went to Delphi, to consult Apollo concerning the success 
<A NAME="416"></A>of the war he had undertaken, and happening to come on one of the forbidden 
<A NAME="417"></A>days, when it was esteemed improper to give any answer from the oracle, 
<A NAME="418"></A>he sent messengers to desire the priestess to do her office; and when she 
<A NAME="419"></A>refused, on the plea of a law to the contrary, he went up himself, and 
<A NAME="420"></A>began to draw her by force into the temple, until tired and overcome with 
<A NAME="421"></A>his importunity, "My son," said she, "thou art invincible." Alexander taking 
<A NAME="422"></A>hold of what she spoke, declared he had received such an answer as he wished 
<A NAME="423"></A>for, and that it was needless to consult the god any further. Among other 
<A NAME="424"></A>prodigies that attended the departure of his army, the image of Orpheus 
<A NAME="425"></A>at Libethra, made of cypress-wood, was seen to sweat in great abundance, 
<A NAME="426"></A>to the discouragement of many. But Aristander told him that, far from presaging 
<A NAME="427"></A>any ill to him, it signified he should perform acts so important and glorious 
<A NAME="428"></A>as would make the poets and musicians of future ages labour and sweat to 
<A NAME="429"></A>describe and celebrate them.
<A NAME="430"></A><BR><BR>His army, by their computation who make the smallest amount, consisted 
<A NAME="431"></A>of thirty thousand foot and four thousand horse; and those who make the 
<A NAME="432"></A>most of it, speak but of forty-three thousand foot and three thousand horse. 
<A NAME="433"></A>Aristobulus says, he had not a fund of above seventy talents for their 
<A NAME="434"></A>pay, nor had he more than thirty days' provision, if we may believe Duris; 
<A NAME="435"></A>Onesicritus tells us he was two hundred talents in debt. However narrow 
<A NAME="436"></A>and disproportionable the beginnings of so vast an undertaking might seem 
<A NAME="437"></A>to be, yet he would not embark his army until he had informed himself particularly 
<A NAME="438"></A>what means his friends had to enable them to follow him, and supplied what 
<A NAME="439"></A>they wanted, by giving good farms to some, a village to one, and the revenue 
<A NAME="440"></A>of some hamlet or harbour-town to another. So that at last he had portioned 
<A NAME="441"></A>out or engaged almost all the royal property; which giving Perdiccas an 
<A NAME="442"></A>occasion to ask him what he would leave himself, he replied, his hopes. 
<A NAME="443"></A>"Your soldiers," replied Perdiccas, "will be your partners in those," and 
<A NAME="444"></A>refused to accept of the estate he had assigned him. Some others of his 
<A NAME="445"></A>friends did the like, but to those who willingly received or desired assistance 
<A NAME="446"></A>of him, he liberally granted it, as far as his patrimony in Macedonia would 
<A NAME="447"></A>reach, the most part of which was spent in these donations.
<A NAME="448"></A><BR><BR>With such vigorous resolutions, and his mind thus disposed, he 
<A NAME="449"></A>passed the Hellespont, and at Troy sacrificed to Minerva, and honoured 
<A NAME="450"></A>the memory of the heroes who were buried there, with solemn libations; 
<A NAME="451"></A>especially Achilles, whose gravestone he anointed, and with his friends, 
<A NAME="452"></A>as the ancient custom is, ran naked about his sepulchre, and crowned it 
<A NAME="453"></A>with garlands, declaring how happy he esteemed him, in having while he 
<A NAME="454"></A>lived so faithful a friend, and when he was dead, so famous a poet to proclaim 
<A NAME="455"></A>his actions. While he was viewing the rest of the antiquities and curiosities 
<A NAME="456"></A>of the place, being told he might see Paris's harp, if he pleased, he said 
<A NAME="457"></A>he thought it not worth looking on, but he should be glad to see that of 
<A NAME="458"></A>Achilles, to which he used to sing the glories and great actions of brave 
<A NAME="459"></A>men.
<A NAME="460"></A><BR><BR>In the meantime, Darius's captains, having collected large forces, 
<A NAME="461"></A>were encamped on the further bank of the river Granicus, and it was necessary 
<A NAME="462"></A>to fight, as it were, in the gate of Asia for an entrance into it. The 
<A NAME="463"></A>depth of the river, with the unevenness and difficult ascent of the opposite 
<A NAME="464"></A>bank, which was to be gained by main force, was apprehended by most, and 
<A NAME="465"></A>some pronounced it an improper time to engage, because it was unusual for 
<A NAME="466"></A>the kings of Macedonia to march with their forces in the month called Daesius. 
<A NAME="467"></A>But Alexander broke through these scruples, telling them they should call 
<A NAME="468"></A>it a second Artemisius. And when Parmenio advised him not to attempt anything 
<A NAME="469"></A>that day, because it was late, he told him that he should disgrace the 
<A NAME="470"></A>Hellespont should he fear the Granicus. And so, without more saying, he 
<A NAME="471"></A>immediately took the river with thirteen troops of horse, and advanced 
<A NAME="472"></A>against whole showers of darts thrown from the steep opposite side, which 
<A NAME="473"></A>was covered with armed multitudes of the enemy's horse and foot, notwithstanding 
<A NAME="474"></A>the disadvantage of the ground and the rapidity of the stream; so that 
<A NAME="475"></A>the action seemed to have more frenzy and desperation in it, than of prudent 
<A NAME="476"></A>conduct. However, he persisted obstinately to gain the passage, and at 
<A NAME="477"></A>last with much ado making his way up the banks, which were extremely muddy 
<A NAME="478"></A>and slippery, he had instantly to join in a mere confused hand-to-hand 
<A NAME="479"></A>combat with the enemy, before he could draw up his men, who were still 
<A NAME="480"></A>passing over, into any order. For the enemy pressed upon him with loud 
<A NAME="481"></A>and warlike outcries; and charging horse against horse, with their lances, 
<A NAME="482"></A>after they had broken and spent these, they fell to it with their swords. 
<A NAME="483"></A>And Alexander, being easily known by his buckler, and a large plume of 
<A NAME="484"></A>white feathers on each side of his helmet, was attacked on all sides, yet 
<A NAME="485"></A>escaped wounding, though his cuirass was pierced by a javelin in one of 
<A NAME="486"></A>the joinings. And Rhoesaces and Spithridates, two Persian commanders, falling 
<A NAME="487"></A>upon him at once, he avoided one of them, and struck at Rhoesaces, who 
<A NAME="488"></A>had a good cuirass on, with such force that, his spear breaking in his 
<A NAME="489"></A>hand, he was glad to betake himself to his dagger. While they were thus 
<A NAME="490"></A>engaged, Spithridates came up on one side of him, and raising himself upon 
<A NAME="491"></A>his horse, gave him such a blow with his battle-axe on the helmet that 
<A NAME="492"></A>he cut off the crest of it, with one of his plumes, and the helmet was 
<A NAME="493"></A>only just so far strong enough to save him, that the edge of the weapon 
<A NAME="494"></A>touched the hair of his head. But as he was about to repeat his stroke, 
<A NAME="495"></A>Clitus, called the black Clitus, prevented him, by running him through 
<A NAME="496"></A>the body with his spear. At the same time Alexander despatched Rhoesaces 
<A NAME="497"></A>with his sword. While the horse were thus dangerously engaged, the Macedonian 
<A NAME="498"></A>phalanx passed the river, and the foot on each side advanced to fight. 
<A NAME="499"></A>But the enemy hardly sustaining the first onset soon gave ground and fled, 
<A NAME="500"></A>all but the mercenary Greeks, who, making a stand upon a rising ground, 
<A NAME="501"></A>desired quarter, which Alexander, guided rather by passion than judgment, 
<A NAME="502"></A>refused to grant, and charging them himself first, had his horse (not Bucephalus, 
<A NAME="503"></A>but another) killed under him. And this obstinacy of his to cut off these 
<A NAME="504"></A>experienced desperate men cost him the lives of more of his own soldiers 
<A NAME="505"></A>than all the battle before, besides those who were wounded. The Persians 
<A NAME="506"></A>lost in this battle twenty thousand foot and two thousand five hundred 
<A NAME="507"></A>horse. On Alexander's side, Aristobulus says there were not wanting above 
<A NAME="508"></A>four-and-thirty, of whom nine were foot-soldiers; and in memory of them 
<A NAME="509"></A>he caused so many statues of brass, of Lysippus's making, to be erected. 
<A NAME="510"></A>And that the Grecians might participate in the honour of his victory he 
<A NAME="511"></A>sent a portion of the spoils home to them particularly to the Athenians 
<A NAME="512"></A>three hundred bucklers, and upon all the rest he ordered this inscription 
<A NAME="513"></A>to be set: "Alexander the son of Philip, and the Grecians, except the Lacedaemonians, 
<A NAME="514"></A>won these from the barbarians who inhabit Asia." All the plate and purple 
<A NAME="515"></A>garments, and other things of the same kind that he took from the Persians, 
<A NAME="516"></A>except a very small quantity which he reserved for himself, he sent as 
<A NAME="517"></A>a present to his mother.
<A NAME="518"></A><BR><BR>This battle presently made a great change of affairs to Alexander's 
<A NAME="519"></A>advantage. For Sardis itself, the chief seat of the barbarian's power in 
<A NAME="520"></A>the maritime provinces, and many other considerable places, were surrendered 
<A NAME="521"></A>to him; only Halicarnassus and Miletus stood out, which he took by force, 
<A NAME="522"></A>together with the territory about them. After which he was a little unsettled 
<A NAME="523"></A>in his opinion how to proceed. Sometimes he thought it best to find out 
<A NAME="524"></A>Darius as soon as he could, and put all to the hazard of a battle; another 
<A NAME="525"></A>while he looked upon it as a more prudent course to make an entire reduction 
<A NAME="526"></A>of the sea-coast, and not to seek the enemy till he had first exercised 
<A NAME="527"></A>his power here and made himself secure of the resources of these provinces. 
<A NAME="528"></A>While he was thus deliberating what to do, it happened that a spring of 
<A NAME="529"></A>water near the city of Xanthus in Lycia, of its own accord, swelled over 
<A NAME="530"></A>its banks, and threw up a copper plate, upon the margin of which was engraven 
<A NAME="531"></A>in ancient characters, that the time would come when the Persian empire 
<A NAME="532"></A>should be destroyed by the Grecians. Encouraged by this accident, he proceeded 
<A NAME="533"></A>to reduce the maritime parts of Cilicia and Phoenicia, and passed his army 
<A NAME="534"></A>along the sea-coasts of Pamphylia with such expedition that many historians 
<A NAME="535"></A>have described and extolled it with that height of admiration, as if it 
<A NAME="536"></A>were no less than a miracle, and an extraordinary effect of divine favour, 
<A NAME="537"></A>that the waves which usually come rolling in violently from the main, and 
<A NAME="538"></A>hardly ever leave so much as a narrow beach under the steep, broken cliffs 
<A NAME="539"></A>at any time uncovered, should on a sudden retire to afford him passage. 
<A NAME="540"></A>Menander, in one of his comedies, alludes to this marvel when he 
<A NAME="541"></A>says-
<A NAME="542"></A><BR><BR>"Was Alexander ever favoured more?
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>Each man I wish for meets me at my door,
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>And should I ask for passage through the sea,
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>The sea I doubt not would retire for me."
<A NAME="546"></A><BR><BR>But Alexander himself in his epistles mentions nothing unusual 
<A NAME="547"></A>in this at all, but says he went from Phaselis, and passed through what 
<A NAME="548"></A>they call the Ladders. At Phaselis he stayed some time, and finding the 
<A NAME="549"></A>statue of Theodectes, who was a native of this town and was now dead, erected 
<A NAME="550"></A>in the market-place, after he had supped, having drunk pretty plentifully, 
<A NAME="551"></A>he went and danced about it, and crowned it with garlands, honouring not 
<A NAME="552"></A>ungracefully, in his sport, the memory of a philosopher whose conversation 
<A NAME="553"></A>he had formerly enjoyed when he was Aristotle's scholar.
<A NAME="554"></A><BR><BR>Then he subdued the Pisidians who made head against him, and conquered 
<A NAME="555"></A>the Phrygians, at whose chief city, Gordium, which is said to be the seat 
<A NAME="556"></A>of the ancient Midas, he saw the famous chariot fastened with cords made 
<A NAME="557"></A>of the rind of the cornel-tree, which whosoever should untie, the inhabitants 
<A NAME="558"></A>had a tradition, that for him was reserved the empire of the world. Most 
<A NAME="559"></A>authors tell the story that Alexander finding himself unable to untie the 
<A NAME="560"></A>knot, the ends of which were secretly twisted round and folded up within 
<A NAME="561"></A>it, cut it asunder with his sword. But Aristobulus tells us it was easy 
<A NAME="562"></A>for him to undo it, by only pulling the pin out of the pole, to which the 
<A NAME="563"></A>yoke was tied, and afterwards drawing off the yoke itself from below. From 
<A NAME="564"></A>hence he advanced into Paphlagonia and Cappadocia, both which countries 
<A NAME="565"></A>he soon reduced to obedience, and then hearing of the death of Memnon, 
<A NAME="566"></A>the best commander Darius had upon the sea-coasts, who, if he had lived, 
<A NAME="567"></A>might, it was supposed, have put many impediments and difficulties in the 
<A NAME="568"></A>way of the progress of his arms, he was the rather encouraged to carry 
<A NAME="569"></A>the war into the upper provinces of Asia.
<A NAME="570"></A><BR><BR>Darius was by this time upon his march from Susa, very confident, 
<A NAME="571"></A>not only in the number of his men, which amounted to six hundred thousand, 
<A NAME="572"></A>but likewise in a dream, which the Persian soothsayers interpreted rather 
<A NAME="573"></A>in flattery to him than according to the natural probability. He dreamed 
<A NAME="574"></A>that he saw the Macedonian phalanx all on fire, and Alexander waiting on 
<A NAME="575"></A>him, clad in the same dress which he himself had been used to wear when 
<A NAME="576"></A>he was courier to the late king; after which, going into the temple of 
<A NAME="577"></A>Belus, he vanished out of his sight. The dream would appear to have supernaturally 
<A NAME="578"></A>signified to him the illustrious actions the Macedonians were to perform, 
<A NAME="579"></A>and that as he, from a courier's place, had risen to the throne, so Alexander 
<A NAME="580"></A>should come to be master of Asia, and not long surviving his conquests, 
<A NAME="581"></A>conclude his life with glory. Darius's confidence increased the more, because 
<A NAME="582"></A>Alexander spent so much time in Cilicia, which he imputed to his cowardice. 
<A NAME="583"></A>But it was sickness that detained him there, which some say he contracted 
<A NAME="584"></A>from his fatigues, others from bathing in the river Cydnus, whose waters 
<A NAME="585"></A>were exceedingly cold. However it happened, none of his physicians would 
<A NAME="586"></A>venture to give him any remedies, they thought his case so desperate, and 
<A NAME="587"></A>were so afraid of the suspicions and ill-will of the Macedonians if they 
<A NAME="588"></A>should fail in the cure; till Philip, the Acarnanian, seeing how critical 
<A NAME="589"></A>his case was, but relying on his own well-known friendship for him, resolved 
<A NAME="590"></A>to try the last efforts of his art, and rather hazard his own credit and 
<A NAME="591"></A>life than suffer him to perish for want of physic, which he confidently 
<A NAME="592"></A>administered to him, encouraging him to take it boldly, if he desired a 
<A NAME="593"></A>speedy recovery, in order to prosecute the war. At this very time, Parmenio 
<A NAME="594"></A>wrote to Alexander from the camp, bidding him have a care of Philip, as 
<A NAME="595"></A>one who was bribed by Darius to kill him, with great sums of money, and 
<A NAME="596"></A>a promise of his daughter in marriage. When he had perused the letter, 
<A NAME="597"></A>he put it under his pillow, without showing it so much as to any of his 
<A NAME="598"></A>most intimate friends, and when Philip came in with the potion, he took 
<A NAME="599"></A>it with great cheerfulness and assurance, giving him meantime the letter 
<A NAME="600"></A>to read. This was a spectacle well worth being present at, to see Alexander 
<A NAME="601"></A>take the draught and Philip read the letter at the same time, and then 
<A NAME="602"></A>turn and look upon one another, but with different sentiments; for Alexander's 
<A NAME="603"></A>looks were cheerful and open, to show his kindness to and confidence in 
<A NAME="604"></A>his physician, while the other was full of surprise and alarm at the accusation, 
<A NAME="605"></A>appealing to the gods to witness his innocence, sometimes lifting up his 
<A NAME="606"></A>hands to heaven, and then throwing himself down by the bedside, and beseeching 
<A NAME="607"></A>Alexander to lay aside all fear, and follow his directions without apprehension. 
<A NAME="608"></A>For the medicine at first worked so strongly as to drive, so to say, the 
<A NAME="609"></A>vital forces into the interior; he lost his speech, and falling into a 
<A NAME="610"></A>swoon, had scarce any sense or pulse left. However in no long time, by 
<A NAME="611"></A>Philip's means, his health and strength returned, and he showed himself 
<A NAME="612"></A>in public to the Macedonians, who were in continual fear and dejection 
<A NAME="613"></A>until they saw him abroad again.
<A NAME="614"></A><BR><BR>There was at this time in Darius's army a Macedonian refugee, named 
<A NAME="615"></A>Amyntas, one who was pretty well acquainted with Alexander's character. 
<A NAME="616"></A>This man, when he saw Darius intended to fall upon the enemy in the passes 
<A NAME="617"></A>and defiles, advised him earnestly to keep where he was, in the open and 
<A NAME="618"></A>extensive plains, it being the advantage of a numerous army to have field-room 
<A NAME="619"></A>enough when it engaged with a lesser force. Darius, instead of taking his 
<A NAME="620"></A>counsel, told him he was afraid the enemy would endeavour to run away, 
<A NAME="621"></A>and so Alexander would escape out of his hands. "That fear," replied Amyntas, 
<A NAME="622"></A>"is needless, for assure yourself that far from avoiding you, he will make 
<A NAME="623"></A>all the speed he can to meet you, and is now most likely on his march toward 
<A NAME="624"></A>you." But Amyntas's counsel was to no purpose, for Darius immediately decamping, 
<A NAME="625"></A>marched into Cilicia at the same time that Alexander advanced into Syria 
<A NAME="626"></A>to meet him; and missing one another in the night, they both turned back 
<A NAME="627"></A>again. Alexander, greatly pleased with the event, made all the haste he 
<A NAME="628"></A>could to fight in the defiles, and Darius to recover his former ground, 
<A NAME="629"></A>and draw his army out of so disadvantageous a place. For now he began to 
<A NAME="630"></A>perceive his error in engaging himself too far in a country in which the 
<A NAME="631"></A>sea, the mountains, and the river Pinarus running through the midst of 
<A NAME="632"></A>it, would necessitate him to divide his forces, render his horse almost 
<A NAME="633"></A>unserviceable, and only cover and support the weakness of the enemy. Fortune 
<A NAME="634"></A>was not kinder to Alexander in the choice of the ground, than he was careful 
<A NAME="635"></A>to improve it to his advantage. For being much inferior in numbers, so 
<A NAME="636"></A>far from allowing himself to be outflanked, he stretched his right wing 
<A NAME="637"></A>much further out than the left wing of his enemies, and fighting there 
<A NAME="638"></A>himself in the very foremost ranks, put the barbarians to flight. In this 
<A NAME="639"></A>battle he was wounded in the thigh, Chares says, by Darius, with whom he 
<A NAME="640"></A>fought hand-to-hand. But in the account which he gave Antipater of the 
<A NAME="641"></A>battle, though indeed he owns he was wounded in the thigh with a sword, 
<A NAME="642"></A>though not dangerously, yet he takes no notice who it was that wounded 
<A NAME="643"></A>him.
<A NAME="644"></A><BR><BR>Nothing was wanting to complete this victory, in which he overthrew 
<A NAME="645"></A>above an hundred and ten thousand of his enemies, but the taking the person 
<A NAME="646"></A>of Darius, who escaped very narrowly by flight. However, having taken his 
<A NAME="647"></A>chariot and his bow, he returned from pursuing him, and found his own men 
<A NAME="648"></A>busy in pillaging the barbarians' camp, which (though to disburden themselves 
<A NAME="649"></A>they had left most of their baggage at Damascus) was exceedingly rich. 
<A NAME="650"></A>But Darius's tent, which was full of splendid furniture and quantities 
<A NAME="651"></A>of gold and silver, they reserved for Alexander himself, who, after he 
<A NAME="652"></A>had put off his arms, went to bathe himself saying, "Let us now cleanse 
<A NAME="653"></A>ourselves from the toils of war in the bath of Darius." "Not so," replied 
<A NAME="654"></A>one of his followers, "but in Alexander's rather; for the property of the 
<A NAME="655"></A>conquered is and should be called the conqueror's." Here, when he beheld 
<A NAME="656"></A>the bathing vessels, the water-pots, the pans, and the ointment boxes, 
<A NAME="657"></A>all of gold curiously wrought, and smelt the fragrant odours with which 
<A NAME="658"></A>the whole place was exquisitely perfumed, and from thence passed into a 
<A NAME="659"></A>pavilion of great size and height, where the couches and tables and preparations 
<A NAME="660"></A>for an entertainment were perfectly magnificent, he turned to those about 
<A NAME="661"></A>him and said, "This, it seems, is royalty."
<A NAME="662"></A><BR><BR>But as he was going to supper, word was brought him that Darius's 
<A NAME="663"></A>mother and wife and two unmarried daughters, being taken among the rest 
<A NAME="664"></A>of the prisoners, upon the sight of his chariot and bow, were all in mourning 
<A NAME="665"></A>and sorrow, imagining him to be dead. After a little pause, more lively 
<A NAME="666"></A>affected with their affliction than with his own success, he sent Leonnatus 
<A NAME="667"></A>to them, to let them know Darius was not dead, and that they need not fear 
<A NAME="668"></A>any harm from Alexander, who made war upon him only for dominion; they 
<A NAME="669"></A>should themselves be provided with everything they had been used to receive 
<A NAME="670"></A>from Darius. This kind message could not but be very welcome to the captive 
<A NAME="671"></A>ladies, especially being made good by actions no less humane and generous. 
<A NAME="672"></A>For he gave them leave to bury whom they pleased of the Persians, and to 
<A NAME="673"></A>make use for this purpose of what garments and furniture they thought fit 
<A NAME="674"></A>out of the booty. He diminished nothing of their equipage, or of the attentions 
<A NAME="675"></A>and respect formerly paid them, and allowed larger pensions for their maintenance 
<A NAME="676"></A>than they had before. But the noblest and most royal part of their usage 
<A NAME="677"></A>was, that he treated these illustrious prisoners according to their virtue 
<A NAME="678"></A>and character, not suffering them to hear, or receive, or so much as to 
<A NAME="679"></A>apprehend anything that was unbecoming. So that they seemed rather lodged 
<A NAME="680"></A>in some temple, or some holy virgin chambers, where they enjoyed their 
<A NAME="681"></A>privacy sacred and uninterrupted, than in the camp of an enemy. Nevertheless 
<A NAME="682"></A>Darius's wife was accounted the most beautiful princess then living, as 
<A NAME="683"></A>her husband the tallest and handsomest man of his time, and the daughters 
<A NAME="684"></A>were not unworthy of their parents. But Alexander, esteeming it more kingly 
<A NAME="685"></A>to govern himself than to conquer his enemies, sought no intimacy with 
<A NAME="686"></A>any one of them, nor indeed with any other women before marriage, except 
<A NAME="687"></A>Barsine, Memnon's widow, who was taken prisoner at Damascus. She had been 
<A NAME="688"></A>instructed in the Grecian learning, was of a gentle temper, and by her 
<A NAME="689"></A>father, Artabazus, royally descended, with good qualities, added to the 
<A NAME="690"></A>solicitations and encouragement of Parmenio, as Aristobulus tells us, made 
<A NAME="691"></A>him the more willing to attach himself to so agreeable and illustrious 
<A NAME="692"></A>a woman. Of the rest of the female captives, though remarkably handsome 
<A NAME="693"></A>and well proportioned, he took no further notice than to say jestingly 
<A NAME="694"></A>that Persian women were terrible eyesores. And he himself, retaliating, 
<A NAME="695"></A>as it were, by the display of the beauty of his own temperance and self-control, 
<A NAME="696"></A>bade them be removed, as he would have done so many lifeless images. When 
<A NAME="697"></A>Philoxenus, his lieutenant on the sea-coast, wrote to him to know if he 
<A NAME="698"></A>would buy two young boys of great beauty, whom one Theodorus, a Tarentine, 
<A NAME="699"></A>had to sell, he was so offended that he often expostulated with his friends 
<A NAME="700"></A>what baseness Philoxenus had ever observed in him that he should presume 
<A NAME="701"></A>to make him such a reproachful offer. And he immediately wrote him a very 
<A NAME="702"></A>sharp letter, telling him Theodorus and his merchandise might go with his 
<A NAME="703"></A>good-will to destruction. Nor was he less severe to Hagnon, who sent him 
<A NAME="704"></A>word he would buy a Corinthian youth named Crobylus, as a present for him. 
<A NAME="705"></A>And hearing that Damon and Timotheus, two of Parmenio's Macedonian soldiers, 
<A NAME="706"></A>had abused the wives of some strangers who were in his pay, he wrote to 
<A NAME="707"></A>Parmenio, charging him strictly, if he found them guilty, to put them to 
<A NAME="708"></A>death, as wild beasts that were only made for the mischief of mankind. 
<A NAME="709"></A>In the same letter he added, that he had not so much as seen or desired 
<A NAME="710"></A>to see the wife of Darius, nor suffered anybody to speak of her beauty 
<A NAME="711"></A>before him. He was wont to say that sleep and the act of generation chiefly 
<A NAME="712"></A>made him sensible that he was mortal; as much as to say, that weariness 
<A NAME="713"></A>and pleasure proceed both from the same frailty and imbecility of human 
<A NAME="714"></A>nature.
<A NAME="715"></A><BR><BR>In his diet, also, he was most temperate, as appears, omitting 
<A NAME="716"></A>many other circumstances, by what he said to Ada, whom he adopted, with 
<A NAME="717"></A>the title of mother, and afterwards created Queen of Caria. For when she, 
<A NAME="718"></A>out of kindness, sent him every day many curious dishes and sweetmeats, 
<A NAME="719"></A>and would have furnished him with some cooks and pastry-men, who were thought 
<A NAME="720"></A>to have great skill, he told her he wanted none of them, his preceptor, 
<A NAME="721"></A>Leonidas, having already given him the best, which were a night march to 
<A NAME="722"></A>prepare for breakfast, and a moderate breakfast to create an appetite for 
<A NAME="723"></A>supper. Leonidas also, he added, used to open and search the furniture 
<A NAME="724"></A>of his chamber and his wardrobe, to see if his mother had left him anything 
<A NAME="725"></A>that was delicate or superfluous. He was much less addicted to wine than 
<A NAME="726"></A>was generally believed; that which gave people occasion to think so of 
<A NAME="727"></A>him was, that when he had nothing else to do, he loved to sit long and 
<A NAME="728"></A>talk, rather than drink, and over every cup hold a long conversation. For 
<A NAME="729"></A>when his affairs called upon him, he would not be detained, as other generals 
<A NAME="730"></A>often were, either by wine, or sleep, nuptial solemnities, spectacles, 
<A NAME="731"></A>or any other diversion whatsoever; a convincing argument of which is, that 
<A NAME="732"></A>in the short time he lived, he accomplished so many and so great actions. 
<A NAME="733"></A>When he was free from employment, after he was up, and had sacrificed to 
<A NAME="734"></A>the gods he used to sit down to breakfast, and then spend the rest of the 
<A NAME="735"></A>day in hunting, or writing memoirs, giving decisions on some military questions, 
<A NAME="736"></A>or reading. In marches that required no great haste, he would practise 
<A NAME="737"></A>shooting as he went along, or to mount a chariot and alight from it in 
<A NAME="738"></A>full speed. Sometimes, for sport's sake, as his journals tell us, he would 
<A NAME="739"></A>hunt foxes and go fowling. When he came in for the evening, after he had 
<A NAME="740"></A>bathed and was anointed, he would call for his bakers and chief cooks, 
<A NAME="741"></A>to know if they had his dinner ready. He never cared to dine till it was 
<A NAME="742"></A>pretty late and beginning to be dark, and was wonderfully circumspect at 
<A NAME="743"></A>meals that every one who sat with him should be served alike and with proper 
<A NAME="744"></A>attention: and his love of talking, as was said before, made him delight 
<A NAME="745"></A>to sit long at his wine. And then, though otherwise no prince's conversation 
<A NAME="746"></A>was ever so agreeable, he would fall into a temper of ostentation and soldierly 
<A NAME="747"></A>boasting, which gave his flatterers a great advantage to ride him, and 
<A NAME="748"></A>made his better friends very uneasy. For though they thought it too base 
<A NAME="749"></A>to strive who should flatter him most, yet they found it hazardous not 
<A NAME="750"></A>to do it; so that between the shame and the danger, they were in a great 
<A NAME="751"></A>strait how to behave themselves. After such an entertainment, he was wont 
<A NAME="752"></A>to bathe, and then perhaps he would sleep till noon, and sometimes all 
<A NAME="753"></A>day long. He was so very temperate in his eating, that when any rare fish 
<A NAME="754"></A>or fruits were sent him, he would distribute them among his friends, and 
<A NAME="755"></A>often reserve nothing for himself. His table, however, was always magnificent, 
<A NAME="756"></A>the expense of it still increasing with his good fortune, till it amounted 
<A NAME="757"></A>to ten thousand drachmas a day, to which sum he limited it, and beyond 
<A NAME="758"></A>this he would suffer none to lay out in any entertainment where he himself 
<A NAME="759"></A>was the guest.
<A NAME="760"></A><BR><BR>After the battle of Issus, he sent to Damascus to seize upon the 
<A NAME="761"></A>money and baggage, the wives and children, of the Persians, of which spoil 
<A NAME="762"></A>the Thessalian horsemen had the greatest share; for he had taken particular 
<A NAME="763"></A>notice of their gallantry in the fight, and sent them thither on purpose 
<A NAME="764"></A>to make their reward suitable to their courage. Not but that the rest of 
<A NAME="765"></A>the army had so considerable a part of the booty as was sufficient to enrich 
<A NAME="766"></A>them all. This first gave the Macedonians such a taste of the Persian wealth 
<A NAME="767"></A>and women and barbaric splendour of living, that they were ready to pursue 
<A NAME="768"></A>and follow upon it with all the eagerness of hounds upon a scent. But Alexander, 
<A NAME="769"></A>before he proceeded any further, thought it necessary to assure himself 
<A NAME="770"></A>of the sea-coast. Those who governed in Cyprus put that island into his 
<A NAME="771"></A>possession, and Phoenicia, Tyre only excepted, was surrendered to him. 
<A NAME="772"></A>During the siege of this city, which, with mounds of earth cast up, and 
<A NAME="773"></A>battering engines, and two hundred galleys by sea, was carried on for seven 
<A NAME="774"></A>months together, he dreamt that he saw Hercules upon the walls, reaching 
<A NAME="775"></A>out his hands, and calling to him. And many of the Tyrians in their sleep 
<A NAME="776"></A>fancied that Apollo told them he was displeased with their actions, and 
<A NAME="777"></A>was about to leave them and go over to Alexander. Upon which, as if the 
<A NAME="778"></A>god had been a deserting soldier, they seized him, so to say, in the act, 
<A NAME="779"></A>tied down the statue with ropes, and nailed it to the pedestal, reproaching 
<A NAME="780"></A>him that he was a favourer of Alexander. Another time Alexander dreamed 
<A NAME="781"></A>he saw a satyr mocking him at a distance, and when he endeavoured to catch 
<A NAME="782"></A>him, he still escaped from him, till at last with much perseverance, and 
<A NAME="783"></A>running about after him, he got him into his power. The soothsayers, making 
<A NAME="784"></A>two words of Satyrus, assured him that Tyre should be his own. The inhabitants 
<A NAME="785"></A>at this time show a spring of water, near which they say Alexander slept 
<A NAME="786"></A>when he fancied the satyr appeared to him.
<A NAME="787"></A><BR><BR>While the body of the army lay before Tyre, he made an excursion 
<A NAME="788"></A>against the Arabians who inhabit the Mount Antilibanus, in which he hazarded 
<A NAME="789"></A>his life extremely to bring off his master Lysimachus, who would needs 
<A NAME="790"></A>go along with him, declaring he was neither older nor inferior in courage 
<A NAME="791"></A>to Phoenix, Achilles's guardian. For when, quitting their horses, they 
<A NAME="792"></A>began to march up the hills on foot, the rest of the soldiers outwent them 
<A NAME="793"></A>a great deal, so that night drawing on, and the enemy near, Alexander was 
<A NAME="794"></A>fain to stay behind so long, to encourage and help up the lagging and tired 
<A NAME="795"></A>old man, that before he was aware he was left behind, a great way from 
<A NAME="796"></A>his soldiers, with a slender attendance, and forced to pass an extremely 
<A NAME="797"></A>cold night in the dark, and in a very inconvenient place; till seeing a 
<A NAME="798"></A>great many scattered fires of the enemy at some distance, and trusting 
<A NAME="799"></A>to his agility of body, and as he was always wont by undergoing toils and 
<A NAME="800"></A>labours himself to cheer and support the Macedonians in any distress, he 
<A NAME="801"></A>ran straight to one of the nearest fires, and with his dagger despatching 
<A NAME="802"></A>two of the barbarians that sat by it, snatched up a lighted brand, and 
<A NAME="803"></A>returned with it to his own men. They immediately made a great fire, which 
<A NAME="804"></A>so alarmed the enemy that most of them fled, and those that assaulted them 
<A NAME="805"></A>were soon routed and thus they rested securely the remainder of the night. 
<A NAME="806"></A>Thus Chares writes.
<A NAME="807"></A><BR><BR>But to return to the siege, it had this issue. Alexander, that 
<A NAME="808"></A>he might refresh his army, harassed with many former encounters, had led 
<A NAME="809"></A>only a small party towards the walls, rather to keep the enemy busy than 
<A NAME="810"></A>with any prospect of much advantage. It happened at this time that Aristander, 
<A NAME="811"></A>the soothsayer, after he had sacrificed, upon view of the entrails, affirmed 
<A NAME="812"></A>confidently to those who stood by that the city should be certainly taken 
<A NAME="813"></A>that very month, upon which there was a laugh and some mockery among the 
<A NAME="814"></A>soldiers, as this was the last day of it. The king, seeing him in perplexity, 
<A NAME="815"></A>and always anxious to support the credit of the predictions, gave order 
<A NAME="816"></A>that they should not count it as the thirtieth, but as the twenty-third 
<A NAME="817"></A>of the month, and ordering the trumpets to sound, attacked the walls more 
<A NAME="818"></A>seriously than he at first intended. The sharpness of the assault so inflamed 
<A NAME="819"></A>the rest of his forces who were left in the camp, that they could not hold 
<A NAME="820"></A>from advancing to second it, which they performed with so much vigour that 
<A NAME="821"></A>the Tyrians retired, and the town was carried that very day. The next place 
<A NAME="822"></A>he sat down before was Gaza, one of the largest cities of Syria, when this 
<A NAME="823"></A>accident befell him. A large bird flying over him let a clod of earth fall 
<A NAME="824"></A>upon his shoulder, and then settling upon one of the battering engines, 
<A NAME="825"></A>was suddenly entangled and caught in the nets, composed of sinews, which 
<A NAME="826"></A>protected the ropes with which the machine was managed. This fell out exactly 
<A NAME="827"></A>according to Aristander's prediction, which was, that Alexander should 
<A NAME="828"></A>be wounded and the city reduced.
<A NAME="829"></A><BR><BR>From hence he sent great part of the spoils to Olympias, Cleopatra, 
<A NAME="830"></A>and the rest of his friends, not omitting his preceptor Leonidas, on whom 
<A NAME="831"></A>he bestowed five hundred talents' weight of frankincense and an hundred 
<A NAME="832"></A>of myrrh, in remembrance of the hopes he had once expressed of him when 
<A NAME="833"></A>he was but a child. For Leonidas, it seems, standing by him one day while 
<A NAME="834"></A>he was sacrificing, and seeing him take both his hands full of incense 
<A NAME="835"></A>to throw into the fire, told him it became him to be more sparing in his 
<A NAME="836"></A>offerings, and not to be so profuse till he was master of the countries 
<A NAME="837"></A>which those sweet gums and saying, come from. So Alexander now wrote to 
<A NAME="838"></A>him, saying, "We have sent you abundance of myrrh and frankincense, that 
<A NAME="839"></A>for the future you may not be stingy to the gods." Among the treasures 
<A NAME="840"></A>and other booty that was taken from Darius, there was a very precious casket, 
<A NAME="841"></A>which being brought to Alexander for a great rarity, he asked those about 
<A NAME="842"></A>him what they thought fittest to be laid up in it; and when they had delivered 
<A NAME="843"></A>their various opinions, he told them he should keep Homer's Iliad in it. 
<A NAME="844"></A>This is attested by many credible authors, and if what those of Alexandria 
<A NAME="845"></A>tell us, relying upon the authority of Heraclides, be true, Homer was neither 
<A NAME="846"></A>an idle nor an unprofitable companion to him in his expedition. For when 
<A NAME="847"></A>he was master of Egypt, designing to settle a colony of Grecians there, 
<A NAME="848"></A>he resolved to build a large and populous city, and give it his own name. 
<A NAME="849"></A>In order to which, after he had measured and staked out the ground with 
<A NAME="850"></A>the advice of the best architects, he chanced one night in his sleep to 
<A NAME="851"></A>see a wonderful vision; a grey-headed old man, of a venerable aspect, appeared 
<A NAME="852"></A>to stand by him, and pronounce these verses:-
<A NAME="853"></A><BR><BR>"An island lies, where loud the billows roar,
<A NAME="854"></A><BR>Pharos they call it, on the Egyptian shore."
<A NAME="855"></A><BR><BR>Alexander upon this immediately rose up and went to Pharos, which, 
<A NAME="856"></A>at that time, was an island lying a little above the Canobic mouth of the 
<A NAME="857"></A>river Nile, though it has now been joined to the mainland by a mole. As 
<A NAME="858"></A>soon as he saw the commodious situation of the place, it being a long neck 
<A NAME="859"></A>of land, stretching like an isthmus between large lagoons and shallow waters 
<A NAME="860"></A>on one side and the sea on the other, the latter at the end of it making 
<A NAME="861"></A>a spacious harbour, he said, Homer, besides his other excellences, was 
<A NAME="862"></A>a very good architect, and ordered the plan of a city to be drawn out answerable 
<A NAME="863"></A>to the place. To do which, for want of chalk, the soil being black, they 
<A NAME="864"></A>laid out their lines with flour, taking in a pretty large compass of ground 
<A NAME="865"></A>in a semi-circular figure, and drawing into the inside of the circumference 
<A NAME="866"></A>equal straight lines from each end, thus giving it something of the form 
<A NAME="867"></A>of a cloak or cape; while he was pleasing himself with his design, on a 
<A NAME="868"></A>sudden an infinite number of great birds of several kinds, rising like 
<A NAME="869"></A>a black cloud out of the river and the lake, devoured every morsel of the 
<A NAME="870"></A>flour that had been used in setting out the lines; at which omen even Alexander 
<A NAME="871"></A>himself was troubled, till the augurs restored his confidence again by 
<A NAME="872"></A>telling him it was a sign the city he was about to build would not only 
<A NAME="873"></A>abound in all things within itself, but also be the nurse and feeder of 
<A NAME="874"></A>many nations. He commanded the workmen to proceed, while he went to visit 
<A NAME="875"></A>the temple of Ammon.
<A NAME="876"></A><BR><BR>This was a long and painful, and, in two respects, a dangerous 
<A NAME="877"></A>journey; first, if they should lose their provision of water, as for several 
<A NAME="878"></A>days none could be obtained; and, secondly, if a violent south wind should 
<A NAME="879"></A>rise upon them, while they were travelling through the wide extent of deep 
<A NAME="880"></A>sands, as it is said to have done when Cambyses led his army that way, 
<A NAME="881"></A>blowing the sand together in heaps, and raising, as it were, the whole 
<A NAME="882"></A>desert like a sea upon them, till fifty thousand were swallowed up and 
<A NAME="883"></A>destroyed by it. All these difficulties were weighed and represented to 
<A NAME="884"></A>him; but Alexander was not easily to be diverted from anything he was bent 
<A NAME="885"></A>upon. For fortune having hitherto seconded him in his designs, made him 
<A NAME="886"></A>resolute and firm in his opinions, and the boldness of his temper raised 
<A NAME="887"></A>a sort of passion in him for surmounting difficulties; as if it were not 
<A NAME="888"></A>enough to be always victorious in the field, unless places and seasons 
<A NAME="889"></A>and nature herself submitted to him. In this journey, the relief and assistance 
<A NAME="890"></A>the gods afforded him in his distresses were more remarkable, and obtained 
<A NAME="891"></A>greater belief than the oracles he received afterwards, which, however, 
<A NAME="892"></A>were valued and credited the more on account of those occurrences. For 
<A NAME="893"></A>first, plentiful rains that fell preserved them from any fear of perishing 
<A NAME="894"></A>by drought, and, allaying the extreme dryness of the sand, which now became 
<A NAME="895"></A>moist and firm to travel on, cleared and purified the air. Besides this, 
<A NAME="896"></A>when they were out of their way, and were wandering up and down, because 
<A NAME="897"></A>the marks which were wont to direct the guides were disordered and lost, 
<A NAME="898"></A>they were set right again by some ravens, which flew before them when on 
<A NAME="899"></A>their march, and waited for them when they lingered and fell behind; and 
<A NAME="900"></A>the greatest miracle, as Callisthenes tells us, was that if any of the 
<A NAME="901"></A>company went astray in the night, they never ceased croaking and making 
<A NAME="902"></A>a noise till by that means they had brought them into the right way again. 
<A NAME="903"></A>Having passed through the wilderness, they came to the place where the 
<A NAME="904"></A>high priest, at the first salutation, bade Alexander welcome from his father 
<A NAME="905"></A>Ammon. And being asked by him whether any of his father's murderers had 
<A NAME="906"></A>escaped punishment, he charged him to speak with more respect, since his 
<A NAME="907"></A>was not a mortal father. Then Alexander, changing his expression, desired 
<A NAME="908"></A>to know of him if any of those who murdered Philip were yet unpunished, 
<A NAME="909"></A>and further concerning dominion, whether the empire of the world was reserved 
<A NAME="910"></A>for him? This, the god answered, he should obtain, and that Philip's death 
<A NAME="911"></A>was fully revenged, which gave him so much satisfaction that he made splendid 
<A NAME="912"></A>offerings to Jupiter, and gave the priests very rich presents. This is 
<A NAME="913"></A>what most authors write concerning the oracles. But Alexander, in a letter 
<A NAME="914"></A>to his mother, tells her there were some secret answers, which at his return 
<A NAME="915"></A>he would communicate to her only. Others say that the priest, desirous 
<A NAME="916"></A>as a piece of courtesy to address him in Greek, "O Paidion," by a slip 
<A NAME="917"></A>in pronunciation ended with the s instead of the n, and said "O Paidios," 
<A NAME="918"></A>which mistake Alexander was well enough pleased with, and it went for current 
<A NAME="919"></A>that the oracle had called him so.
<A NAME="920"></A><BR><BR>Among the sayings of one Psammon, a philosopher, whom he heard 
<A NAME="921"></A>in Egypt, he most approved of this, that all men are governed by God, because 
<A NAME="922"></A>in everything, that which is chief and commands is divine. But what he 
<A NAME="923"></A>pronounced himself upon this subject was even more like a philosopher, 
<A NAME="924"></A>for he said God was the common father of us all, but more particularly 
<A NAME="925"></A>of the best of us. To the barbarians he carried himself very haughtily, 
<A NAME="926"></A>as if he were fully persuaded of his divine birth and parentage; but to 
<A NAME="927"></A>the Grecians more moderately, and with less affectation of divinity, except 
<A NAME="928"></A>it were once in writing to the Athenians about Samos, when he tells them 
<A NAME="929"></A>that he should not himself have bestowed upon them that free and glorious 
<A NAME="930"></A>city; "You received it," he says, "from the bounty of him who at that time 
<A NAME="931"></A>was called my lord and father," meaning Philip. However, afterwards being 
<A NAME="932"></A>wounded with an arrow, and feeling much pain, he turned to those about 
<A NAME="933"></A>him, and told them, "This, my friends, is real flowing blood, not 
<A NAME="934"></A>Ichor-
<A NAME="935"></A><BR><BR>"Such as immortal gods are wont to shed." And another time, when 
<A NAME="936"></A>it thundered so much that everybody was afraid, and Anaxarchus, the sophist, 
<A NAME="937"></A>asked him if he who was Jupiter's son could do anything like this, "Nay," 
<A NAME="938"></A>said Alexander, laughing, "I have no desire to be formidable to my friends, 
<A NAME="939"></A>as you would have me, who despised my table for being furnished with fish, 
<A NAME="940"></A>and not with the heads of governors of provinces." For in fact it is related 
<A NAME="941"></A>as true, that Anaxarchus, seeing a present of small fishes, which the king 
<A NAME="942"></A>sent to Hephaestion, had used this expression, in a sort of irony, and 
<A NAME="943"></A>disparagement of those who undergo vast labours and encounter great hazards 
<A NAME="944"></A>in pursuit of magnificent objects which after all bring them little more 
<A NAME="945"></A>pleasure or enjoyment than what others have. From what I have said upon 
<A NAME="946"></A>this subject, it is apparent that Alexander in himself was not foolishly 
<A NAME="947"></A>affected, or had the vanity to think himself really a god, but merely used 
<A NAME="948"></A>his claims to divinity as a means of maintaining among other people the 
<A NAME="949"></A>sense of his superiority.
<A NAME="950"></A><BR><BR>At his return out of Egypt into Phoenicia, he sacrificed and made 
<A NAME="951"></A>solemn processions, to which were added shows of lyric dances and tragedies, 
<A NAME="952"></A>remarkable not merely for the splendour of the equipage and decorations, 
<A NAME="953"></A>but for the competition among those who exhibited them. For the kings of 
<A NAME="954"></A>Cyprus were here the exhibitors, just in the same manner as at Athens those 
<A NAME="955"></A>who are chosen by lot out of the tribes. And, indeed, they showed the greatest 
<A NAME="956"></A>emulation to outvie each other; especially Nicocreon, King of Salamis, 
<A NAME="957"></A>and Pasicrates of Soli, who furnished the chorus, and defrayed the expenses 
<A NAME="958"></A>of the two most celebrated actors, Athenodorus and Thessalus, the former 
<A NAME="959"></A>performing for Pasicrates, and the latter for Nicocrean. Thessalus was 
<A NAME="960"></A>most favoured by Alexander, though it did not appear till Athenodorus was 
<A NAME="961"></A>declared victor by the plurality of votes. For then at his going away, 
<A NAME="962"></A>he said the judges deserved to be commended for what they had done, but 
<A NAME="963"></A>that he would willingly have lost part of his kingdom rather than to have 
<A NAME="964"></A>seen Thessalus overcome. However, when he understood Athenodorus was fined 
<A NAME="965"></A>by the Athenians for being absent at the festivals of Bacchus, though he 
<A NAME="966"></A>refused his request that he would write a letter in his behalf, he gave 
<A NAME="967"></A>him a sufficient sum to satisfy the penalty. Another time, when Lycon of 
<A NAME="968"></A>Scarphia happened to act with great applause in the theatre, and in a verse 
<A NAME="969"></A>which he introduced into the comic part which he was acting, begged for 
<A NAME="970"></A>a present of ten talents, he laughed and gave him the 
<A NAME="971"></A>money.
<A NAME="972"></A><BR><BR>Darius wrote him a letter, and sent friends to intercede with him, 
<A NAME="973"></A>requesting him to accept as a ransom of his captives the sum of a thousand 
<A NAME="974"></A>talents, and offering him in exchange for his amity and alliance all the 
<A NAME="975"></A>countries on this side the river Euphrates, together with one of his daughters 
<A NAME="976"></A>in marriage. These propositions he communicated to his friends, and when 
<A NAME="977"></A>Parmenio told him that, for his part, if he were Alexander, he should readily 
<A NAME="978"></A>embrace them, "So would I," said Alexander, "if I were Parmenio." Accordingly, 
<A NAME="979"></A>his answer to Darius was, that if he would come and yield himself up into 
<A NAME="980"></A>his power he would treat him with all possible kindness; if not, he was 
<A NAME="981"></A>resolved immediately to go himself and seek him. But the death of Darius's 
<A NAME="982"></A>wife in childbirth made him soon after regret one part of this answer, 
<A NAME="983"></A>and he showed evident marks of grief at thus deprived of a further opportunity 
<A NAME="984"></A>of exercising his clemency and good nature, which he manifested, however, 
<A NAME="985"></A>as far as he could, by giving her a most sumptuous funeral.
<A NAME="986"></A><BR><BR>Among the eunuchs who waited in the queen's chamber, and were taken 
<A NAME="987"></A>prisoners with the women, there was one Tireus, who, getting out of the 
<A NAME="988"></A>camp, fled away on horseback to Darius, to inform him of his wife's death. 
<A NAME="989"></A>He, when he heard it, beating his head, and bursting into tears and lamentations, 
<A NAME="990"></A>said, "Alas! how great is the calamity of the Persians! Was it not enough 
<A NAME="991"></A>that their king's consort and sister was a prisoner in her lifetime, but 
<A NAME="992"></A>she must, now she is dead, also be but meanly and obscurely buried?" "O 
<A NAME="993"></A>king," replied the eunuch, "as to her funeral rites, or any respect or 
<A NAME="994"></A>honour that should have been shown in them, you have not the least reason 
<A NAME="995"></A>to accuse the ill fortune of your country; for to my knowledge neither 
<A NAME="996"></A>your queen Statira when alive, nor your mother, nor children, wanted anything 
<A NAME="997"></A>of their former happy condition, unless it were the light of your countenance, 
<A NAME="998"></A>which I doubt not but the lord Oromasdes will yet restore to its former 
<A NAME="999"></A>glory. And after her decease, I assure you, she had not only all due funeral 
<A NAME="1000"></A>ornaments, but was honoured also with the tears of your very enemies; for 
<A NAME="1001"></A>Alexander is as gentle after victory as he is terrible in the field." At 
<A NAME="1002"></A>the bearing of these words, such was the grief and emotion of Darius's 
<A NAME="1003"></A>mind, that they carried him into extravagant suspicions; and taking Tireus 
<A NAME="1004"></A>aside into a more private part of his tent, "Unless thou likewise," said 
<A NAME="1005"></A>he to him, "hast deserted me, together with the good fortune of Persia, 
<A NAME="1006"></A>and art become a Macedonian in thy heart; if thou yet ownest me for thy 
<A NAME="1007"></A>master Darius, tell me, I charge thee, by the veneration thou payest the 
<A NAME="1008"></A>light of Mithras, and this right hand of thy king, do I not lament the 
<A NAME="1009"></A>least of Statira's misfortunes in her captivity and death? Have I not suffered 
<A NAME="1010"></A>something more injurious and deplorable in her lifetime? And had I not 
<A NAME="1011"></A>been miserable with less dishonour if I had met with a more severe and 
<A NAME="1012"></A>inhuman enemy? For how is it possible a young man as he is should treat 
<A NAME="1013"></A>the wife of his opponent with so much distinction, were it not from some 
<A NAME="1014"></A>motive that does me disgrace?" Whilst he was yet speaking, Tireus threw 
<A NAME="1015"></A>himself at his feet, and besought him neither to wrong Alexander so much, 
<A NAME="1016"></A>nor his dead wife and sister, as to give utterance to any such thoughts, 
<A NAME="1017"></A>which deprived him of the greatest consolation left him in his adversity, 
<A NAME="1018"></A>the belief that he was overcome by a man whose virtues raised him above 
<A NAME="1019"></A>human nature; that he ought to look upon Alexander with love and admiration, 
<A NAME="1020"></A>who had given no less proofs of his continence towards the Persian women, 
<A NAME="1021"></A>than of his valour among the men. The eunuch confirmed all he said with 
<A NAME="1022"></A>solemn and dreadful oaths, and was further enlarging upon Alexander's moderation 
<A NAME="1023"></A>and magnanimity on other occasions, when Darius, breaking away from him 
<A NAME="1024"></A>into the other division of the tent, where his friends and courtiers were, 
<A NAME="1025"></A>lifted up his hands to heaven and uttered this prayer, "Ye gods," said 
<A NAME="1026"></A>he, "of my family, and of my kingdom, if it be possible, I beseech you 
<A NAME="1027"></A>to restore the declining affairs of Persia, that I may leave them in as 
<A NAME="1028"></A>flourishing a condition as I found them, and have it in my power to make 
<A NAME="1029"></A>a grateful return to Alexander for the kindness which in my adversity he 
<A NAME="1030"></A>has shown to those who are dearest to me. But if, indeed, the fatal time 
<A NAME="1031"></A>be come, which is to give a period to the Persian monarchy, if our ruin 
<A NAME="1032"></A>be a debt that must be paid to the divine jealousy and the vicissitude 
<A NAME="1033"></A>of things, then I beseech you grant that no other man but Alexander may 
<A NAME="1034"></A>sit upon the throne of Cyrus." Such is the narrative given by the greater 
<A NAME="1035"></A>number of the historians.
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR><BR>But to return to Alexander. After he had reduced all Asia on this 
<A NAME="1037"></A>side the Euphrates, he advanced towards Darius, who was coming down against 
<A NAME="1038"></A>him with a million of men. In his march a very ridiculous passage happened. 
<A NAME="1039"></A>The servants who followed the camp for sport's sake divided themselves 
<A NAME="1040"></A>into two parties, and named the commander of one of them Alexander, and 
<A NAME="1041"></A>the other Darius. At first they only pelted one another with clods of earth, 
<A NAME="1042"></A>but presently took to their fists, and at last, heated with contention, 
<A NAME="1043"></A>they fought in good earnest with stones and clubs, so that they had much 
<A NAME="1044"></A>ado to part them; till Alexander, upon hearing of it, ordered the two captains 
<A NAME="1045"></A>to decide the quarrel by single combat, and armed him who bore his name 
<A NAME="1046"></A>himself, while Philotas did the same to him who represented Darius. The 
<A NAME="1047"></A>whole army were spectators of this encounter, willing from the event of 
<A NAME="1048"></A>it to derive an omen of their own future success. After they had fought 
<A NAME="1049"></A>stoutly a pretty long while, at last he who was called Alexander had the 
<A NAME="1050"></A>better, and for a reward of his prowess had twelve villages given him, 
<A NAME="1051"></A>with leave to wear the Persian dress. So we are told by 
<A NAME="1052"></A>Eratosthenes.
<A NAME="1053"></A><BR><BR>But the great battle of all that was fought with Darius was not, 
<A NAME="1054"></A>as most writers tell us, at Arbela, but at Gaugamela, which, in their language, 
<A NAME="1055"></A>signifies the camel's house, forasmuch as one of their ancient kings having 
<A NAME="1056"></A>escaped the pursuit of his enemies on a swift camel, in gratitude to his 
<A NAME="1057"></A>beast, settled him at this place, with an allowance of certain villages 
<A NAME="1058"></A>and rents for his maintenance. It came to pass that in the month Boedromion, 
<A NAME="1059"></A>about the beginning of the feast of Mysteries at Athens, there was an eclipse 
<A NAME="1060"></A>of the moon, the eleventh night after which, the two armies being now in 
<A NAME="1061"></A>view of one another, Darius kept his men in arms, and by torchlight took 
<A NAME="1062"></A>a general review of them. But Alexander, while his soldiers slept, spent 
<A NAME="1063"></A>the night before his tent with his diviner, Aristander, performing certain 
<A NAME="1064"></A>mysterious ceremonies, and sacrificing to the god Fear. In the meanwhile 
<A NAME="1065"></A>the oldest of his commanders, and chiefly Parmenio, when they beheld all 
<A NAME="1066"></A>the plain between Niphates and the Gordyaean mountains shining with the 
<A NAME="1067"></A>lights and fires which were made by the barbarians, and heard the uncertain 
<A NAME="1068"></A>and confused sounds of voices out of their camp, like the distant roaring 
<A NAME="1069"></A>of a vast ocean, were so amazed at the thoughts of such a multitude, that 
<A NAME="1070"></A>after some conference among themselves, they concluded it an enterprise 
<A NAME="1071"></A>too difficult and hazardous for them to engage so numerous an enemy in 
<A NAME="1072"></A>the day, and therefore meeting the king as he came from sacrificing, besought 
<A NAME="1073"></A>him to attack Darius by night, that the darkness might conceal the danger 
<A NAME="1074"></A>of the ensuing battle. To this he gave them the celebrated answer, "I will 
<A NAME="1075"></A>not steal a victory," which though some at the time thought a boyish and 
<A NAME="1076"></A>inconsiderate speech, as if he played with danger, others, however, regarded 
<A NAME="1077"></A>as an evidence that he confided in his present condition, and acted on 
<A NAME="1078"></A>a true judgment of the future, not wishing to leave Darius, in case he 
<A NAME="1079"></A>were worsted, the pretext of trying his fortune again, which he might suppose 
<A NAME="1080"></A>himself to have, if he could im
