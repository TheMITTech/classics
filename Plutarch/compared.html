<A NAME="2"></A><BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Having described all their actions that seem to deserve commemoration, 
<A NAME="11"></A>their military ones, we may say, incline the balance very decidedly upon 
<A NAME="12"></A>neither side. They both, in pretty equal measure, displayed on numerous 
<A NAME="13"></A>occasions the daring and courage of the soldier, and the skill and foresight 
<A NAME="14"></A>of the general; unless, indeed, the fact that Alcibiades was victorious 
<A NAME="15"></A>and successful in many contests both by sea and land, ought to gain him 
<A NAME="16"></A>the title of a more complete commander. That so long as they remained and 
<A NAME="17"></A>held command in their respective countries they eminently sustained, and 
<A NAME="18"></A>when they were driven into exile yet more eminently damaged, the fortunes 
<A NAME="19"></A>of those countries, is common to both. All the sober citizens felt disgust 
<A NAME="20"></A>at the petulance, the low flattery, and base seductions which Alcibiades, 
<A NAME="21"></A>in his public life, allowed himself to employ with the view of winning 
<A NAME="22"></A>the people's favour; and the ungraciousness, pride, and oligarchical haughtiness 
<A NAME="23"></A>which Marcius, on the other hand, displayed in his, were the abhorrence 
<A NAME="24"></A>of the Roman populace. Neither of these courses can be called commendable; 
<A NAME="25"></A>but a man who ingratiates himself by indulgence and flattery is hardly 
<A NAME="26"></A>so censurable as one who, to avoid the appearance of flattering, insults. 
<A NAME="27"></A>To seek power by servility to the people is a disgrace, but to maintain 
<A NAME="28"></A>it by terror, violence, and oppression is not a disgrace only, but an 
<A NAME="29"></A>injustice.
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>Marcius, according to our common conceptions of his character, 
<A NAME="31"></A>was undoubtedly simple and straightforward; Alcibiades, unscrupulous as 
<A NAME="32"></A>a public man, and false. He is more especially blamed for the dishonourable 
<A NAME="33"></A>and treacherous way in which, as Thucydides relates, he imposed upon the 
<A NAME="34"></A>Lacedaemonian ambassadors, and disturbed the continuance of the peace. 
<A NAME="35"></A>Yet this policy, which engaged the city again in war, nevertheless placed 
<A NAME="36"></A>it in a powerful and formidable position, by the accession, which Alcibiades 
<A NAME="37"></A>obtained for it, of the alliance of Argos and Mantinea. And Coriolanus 
<A NAME="38"></A>also, Dionysius relates, used unfair means to excite war between the Romans 
<A NAME="39"></A>and the Volscians, in the false report which he spread about the visitors 
<A NAME="40"></A>at the Games; and the motive of this action seems to make it the worse 
<A NAME="41"></A>of the two; since it was not done, like the other, out of ordinary political 
<A NAME="42"></A>jealousy, strife, and competition. Simply to gratify anger from which, 
<A NAME="43"></A>as Ion says, no one ever yet got any return, he threw whole districts of 
<A NAME="44"></A>Italy into confusion, and sacrificed to his passion against his country 
<A NAME="45"></A>numerous innocent cities. It is true, indeed, that Alcibiades also, by 
<A NAME="46"></A>his resentment, was the occasion of great disasters to his country, but 
<A NAME="47"></A>he relented as soon as he found their feelings to be changed; and after 
<A NAME="48"></A>he was driven out a second time, so far from taking pleasure in the errors 
<A NAME="49"></A>and inadvertencies of their commanders, or being indifferent to the danger 
<A NAME="50"></A>they were thus incurring, he did the very thing that Aristides is so highly 
<A NAME="51"></A>commended for doing to Themistocles; he came to the generals who were his 
<A NAME="52"></A>enemies, and pointed out to them what they ought to do. Coriolanus, on 
<A NAME="53"></A>the other hand, first of all attacked the whole body of his countrymen, 
<A NAME="54"></A>though only one portion of them had done him any wrong, while the other, 
<A NAME="55"></A>the better and nobler portion, had actually suffered, as well as sympathized, 
<A NAME="56"></A>with him. And, secondly, by the obduracy with which he resisted numerous 
<A NAME="57"></A>embassies and supplications, addressed in propitiation of his single anger 
<A NAME="58"></A>and offence, he showed that it had been to destroy and overthrow, not to 
<A NAME="59"></A>recover and regain his country, that he had excited bitter and implacable 
<A NAME="60"></A>hostilities against it. There is, indeed, one distinction that may be drawn. 
<A NAME="61"></A>Alcibiades, it may be said, was not safe among the Spartans, and had the 
<A NAME="62"></A>inducements at once of fear and of hatred to lead him again to Athens; 
<A NAME="63"></A>whereas Marcius could not honourably have left the Volscians, when they 
<A NAME="64"></A>were behaving so well to him: he, in the command of their forces and the 
<A NAME="65"></A>enjoyment of their entire confidence, was in a very different position 
<A NAME="66"></A>from Alcibiades, whom the Lacedaemonians did not so much wish to adopt 
<A NAME="67"></A>into their service, as to use and then abandon. Driven about from house 
<A NAME="68"></A>to house in the city, and from general to general in the camp, the latter 
<A NAME="69"></A>had no resort but to place himself in the hands of Tisaphernes; unless, 
<A NAME="70"></A>indeed, we are to suppose that his object in courting favour with him was 
<A NAME="71"></A>to avert the entire destruction of his native city, whither he wished himself 
<A NAME="72"></A>to return.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>As regards money, Alcibiades, we are told, was often guilty of 
<A NAME="74"></A>procuring it by accepting bribes, and spent it ill in luxury and dissipation. 
<A NAME="75"></A>Coriolanus declined to receive it, even when pressed upon him by his commanders 
<A NAME="76"></A>as an honour; and one great reason for the odium he incurred with the populace 
<A NAME="77"></A>in the discussions about their debts was, that he trampled upon the poor, 
<A NAME="78"></A>not for money's sake, but out of pride and insolence.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>Antipater, in a letter written upon the death of Aristotle the 
<A NAME="80"></A>philosopher, observes, "Amongst his other gifts he had that of persuasiveness;" 
<A NAME="81"></A>and the absence of this in the character of Marcius made all his great 
<A NAME="82"></A>actions and noble qualities unacceptable to those whom they benefited: 
<A NAME="83"></A>pride, and self-will, the consort, as Plato calls it, of solitude, made 
<A NAME="84"></A>him insufferable. With the skill which Alcibiades, on the contrary, possessed 
<A NAME="85"></A>to treat every one in the way most agreeable to him, we cannot wonder that 
<A NAME="86"></A>all his successes were attended with the most exuberant favour and honour; 
<A NAME="87"></A>his very errors, at times, being accompanied by something of grace and 
<A NAME="88"></A>felicity. And so in spite of great and frequent hurt that he had done the 
<A NAME="89"></A>city, he was repeatedly appointed to office and command; while Coriolanus 
<A NAME="90"></A>stood in vain for a place which his great services had made his due. The 
<A NAME="91"></A>one, in spite of the harm he occasioned, could not make himself hated, 
<A NAME="92"></A>nor the other, with all the admiration he attracted, succeeded in being 
<A NAME="93"></A>beloved by his countrymen.
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR>Coriolanus, moreover, it should be said, did not as a general obtain 
<A NAME="95"></A>any successes for his country, but only for his enemies against his country. 
<A NAME="96"></A>Alcibiades was often of service to Athens, both as a soldier and as a commander. 
<A NAME="97"></A>So long as he was personally present, he had the perfect mastery of his 
<A NAME="98"></A>political adversaries; calumny only succeeded in his absence. Coriolanus 
<A NAME="99"></A>was condemned in person at Rome; and in like manner killed by the Volscians, 
<A NAME="100"></A>not indeed with any right or justice, yet not without some pretext occasioned 
<A NAME="101"></A>by his own acts; since, after rejecting all conditions of peace in public, 
<A NAME="102"></A>in private he yielded to the solicitations of the women and, without establishing 
<A NAME="103"></A>peace, threw up the favourable chances of war. He ought, before retiring, 
<A NAME="104"></A>to have obtained the consent of those who had placed their trust in him; 
<A NAME="105"></A>if indeed he considered their claims on him to be the strongest. Or, if 
<A NAME="106"></A>we say that he did not care about the Volscians, but merely had prosecuted 
<A NAME="107"></A>the war, which he now abandoned, for the satisfaction of his own resentment, 
<A NAME="108"></A>then the noble thing would have been, not to spare his country for his 
<A NAME="109"></A>mother's sake, but his mother in and with his country; since both his mother 
<A NAME="110"></A>and his wife were part and parcel of that endangered country. After harshly 
<A NAME="111"></A>repelling public supplications, the entreaties of ambassadors, and the 
<A NAME="112"></A>prayers of priests, to concede all as a private favour to his mother was 
<A NAME="113"></A>less an honour to her than a dishonour to the city which thus escaped, 
<A NAME="114"></A>in spite, it would seem, of its own demerits through the intercession of 
<A NAME="115"></A>a single woman. Such a grace could, indeed, seem merely invidious, ungracious, 
<A NAME="116"></A>and unreasonable in the eyes of both parties; he retreated without listening 
<A NAME="117"></A>to the persuasions of his opponents or asking the consent of his friends. 
<A NAME="118"></A>The origin of all lay in his unsociable, supercilious, and self-willed 
<A NAME="119"></A>disposition, which, in all cases, is offensive to most people; and when 
<A NAME="120"></A>combined with a passion for distinction passes into absolute savageness 
<A NAME="121"></A>and mercilessness. Men decline to ask favours of the people, professing 
<A NAME="122"></A>not to need any honours from them; and then are indignant if they do not 
<A NAME="123"></A>obtain them. Metellus, Aristides, and Epaminondas certainly did not beg 
<A NAME="124"></A>favours of the multitude; but that was because they, in real truth, did 
<A NAME="125"></A>not value the gifts which a popular body can either confer or refuse; and 
<A NAME="126"></A>when they were more than once driven into exile, rejected at elections, 
<A NAME="127"></A>and condemned in courts of justice, they showed no resentment at the ill-humour 
<A NAME="128"></A>of their fellow-citizens, but were willing and contented to return and 
<A NAME="129"></A>be reconciled when the feeling altered and they were wished for. He who 
<A NAME="130"></A>least likes courting favour, ought also least to think of resenting neglect; 
<A NAME="131"></A>to feel wounded at being refused a distinction can only arise from an overweening 
<A NAME="132"></A>appetite to have it.
<A NAME="133"></A><BR><BR>Alcibiades never professed to deny that it was pleasant to him 
<A NAME="134"></A>to be honoured, and distasteful to him to be overlooked; and, accordingly, 
<A NAME="135"></A>he always tried to place himself upon good terms with all that he met; 
<A NAME="136"></A>Coriolanus's pride forbade him to pay attentions to those who could have 
<A NAME="137"></A>promoted his advancement, and yet his love of distinction made him feel 
<A NAME="138"></A>hurt and angry when he was disregarded. Such are the faulty parts of his 
<A NAME="139"></A>character, which in all other respects was a noble one. For his temperance, 
<A NAME="140"></A>continence, and probity he claims to be compared with the best and purest 
<A NAME="141"></A>of the Greeks; not in any sort or kind with Alcibiades, the least scrupulous 
<A NAME="142"></A>and most entirely and most entirely careless of human beings in all these 
<A NAME="143"></A>points.
