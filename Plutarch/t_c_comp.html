<A NAME="1"></A><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>The Comparison of Tiberius and Caius Gracchus with Agis and Cleomenes</B></FONT>
<A NAME="2"></A><BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Having given an account severally of these persons, it remains only that 
<A NAME="11"></A>we should take a view of them in comparison with one 
<A NAME="12"></A>another.
<A NAME="13"></A><BR><BR>As for the Gracchi, the greatest detractors and their worst enemies 
<A NAME="14"></A>could not but allow that they had a genius to virtue beyond all other Romans, 
<A NAME="15"></A>which was improved also by a generous education. Agis and Cleomenes may 
<A NAME="16"></A>be supposed to have had stronger natural gifts, since, though they wanted 
<A NAME="17"></A>all the advantages of good education, and were bred up in those very customs, 
<A NAME="18"></A>manners, and habits of living which had for a long time corrupted others, 
<A NAME="19"></A>yet they were public examples of temperance and frugality. Besides, the 
<A NAME="20"></A>Gracchi, happening to live when Rome had her greatest repute for honour 
<A NAME="21"></A>and virtuous actions, might justly have been ashamed, if they had not also 
<A NAME="22"></A>left to the next generation the noble inheritance of the virtues of their 
<A NAME="23"></A>ancestors. Whereas the other two had parents of different morals, and though 
<A NAME="24"></A>they found their country in a sinking condition, and debauched, yet that 
<A NAME="25"></A>did not quench their forward zeal to what was just and 
<A NAME="26"></A>honourable.
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR>The integrity of the two Romans, and their superiority to money, 
<A NAME="28"></A>was chiefly remarkable in this: that in office and the administration of 
<A NAME="29"></A>public affairs, they kept themselves from the imputation of unjust gain; 
<A NAME="30"></A>whereas Agis might justly be offended if he had only that mean commendation 
<A NAME="31"></A>given him, that he took nothing wrongfully from any man, seeing he distributed 
<A NAME="32"></A>his own fortunes which, in ready money only, amounted to the value of six 
<A NAME="33"></A>hundred talents, amongst his fellow-citizens. Extortion would have appeared 
<A NAME="34"></A>a crime of a strange nature to him, who esteemed it a piece of covetousness 
<A NAME="35"></A>to possess, though never so justly gotten, greater riches than his 
<A NAME="36"></A>neighbours.
<A NAME="37"></A><BR><BR>Their political actions, also, and the state revolutions they attempted, 
<A NAME="38"></A>were very different in magnitude. The chief things in general that the 
<A NAME="39"></A>two Romans commonly aimed at, were the settlement of cities and mending 
<A NAME="40"></A>of highways; and, in particular, the boldest design which Tiberius is famed 
<A NAME="41"></A>for, was the recovery of the public lands; and Caius gained his greatest 
<A NAME="42"></A>reputation by the addition, for the exercise of judiciary powers, of three 
<A NAME="43"></A>hundred of the order of knights to the same number of senators. Whereas 
<A NAME="44"></A>the alteration which Agis and Cleomenes made was in a quite different kind. 
<A NAME="45"></A>They did not set about removing partial evils and curing petty incidents 
<A NAME="46"></A>of disease, which would have been (as Plato says) like cutting off one 
<A NAME="47"></A>of the Hydra's heads, the very means to increase the number; but they instituted 
<A NAME="48"></A>a thorough reformation, such as would free the country from all its grievances, 
<A NAME="49"></A>or rather, to speak more truly, they reversed that former change which 
<A NAME="50"></A>had been the cause of all their calamities, and so restored their city 
<A NAME="51"></A>to its ancient state.
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR>However, this must be confessed in the behalf of the Gracchi, that 
<A NAME="53"></A>their undertakings were always opposed by men of the greatest influence. 
<A NAME="54"></A>On the other side, those things which were first attempted by Agis, and 
<A NAME="55"></A>afterwards consummated by Cleomenes, were supported by the great and glorious 
<A NAME="56"></A>precedent of those ancient laws concerning frugality and levelling which 
<A NAME="57"></A>they had themselves received upon the authority of Lycurgus, and he had 
<A NAME="58"></A>instituted on that of Apollo. It is also further observable, that from 
<A NAME="59"></A>the actions of the Gracchi, Rome received no additions to her former greatness; 
<A NAME="60"></A>whereas, under the conduct of Cleomenes, Greece presently saw Sparta exert 
<A NAME="61"></A>her sovereign power over all Peloponnesus, and contest the supreme command 
<A NAME="62"></A>with the most powerful princes of the time; success in which would have 
<A NAME="63"></A>freed Greece from Illyrian and Gaulish violence, and placed her once again 
<A NAME="64"></A>under the orderly rule of the sons of Hercules.
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR>From the circumstances of their deaths, also, we may infer some 
<A NAME="66"></A>difference in the quality of their courage. The Gracchi, fighting with 
<A NAME="67"></A>their fellow-citizens, were both slain as they endeavoured to make, their 
<A NAME="68"></A>escape; Agis willingly submitted to his fate, rather than any citizen should 
<A NAME="69"></A>be in danger of his life. Cleomenes, being shamefully and unjustly treated, 
<A NAME="70"></A>made an effort toward revenge, but failing of that, generously fell by 
<A NAME="71"></A>his own hand.
<A NAME="72"></A><BR><BR>On the other side it must be said, that Agis never did a great 
<A NAME="73"></A>action worthy a commander, being prevented by an untimely death. And as 
<A NAME="74"></A>for those heroic actions of Cleomenes, we may justly compare with them 
<A NAME="75"></A>that of Tiberius, when he was the first who attempted to scale the walls 
<A NAME="76"></A>of Carthage, which was no mean exploit. We may add the peace which he concluded 
<A NAME="77"></A>with the Numantines, by which he saved the lives of twenty thousand Romans, 
<A NAME="78"></A>who otherwise had certainly been cut off. And Caius, not only at home, 
<A NAME="79"></A>but in war in Sardinia, displayed distinguished courage. So that their 
<A NAME="80"></A>early actions were no small argument that afterwards they might have rivalled 
<A NAME="81"></A>the best of the Roman commanders, if they had not died so 
<A NAME="82"></A>young.
<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR>In civil life, Agis showed a lack of determination; he let himself 
<A NAME="84"></A>be baffled by the craft of Agesilaus, disappointed the expectations of 
<A NAME="85"></A>the citizens as to the division of the lands, and generally left all the 
<A NAME="86"></A>designs, which he had deliberately formed and publicly announced, unperformed 
<A NAME="87"></A>and unfulfilled through a young man's want of resolution. Cleomenes, on 
<A NAME="88"></A>the other hand, proceeded to effect the revolution with only too much boldness 
<A NAME="89"></A>and violence, and unjustly slew the Ephors whom he might, by superiority 
<A NAME="90"></A>in arms, have gained over to his party, or else might easily have banished, 
<A NAME="91"></A>as he did several others of the city. For to use the knife, unless in the 
<A NAME="92"></A>extremest necessity, is neither good surgery nor wise policy, but in both 
<A NAME="93"></A>cases mere unskillfulness; and in the latter, unjust as well as unfeeling. 
<A NAME="94"></A>Of the Gracchi, neither the one nor the other was the first to shed the 
<A NAME="95"></A>blood of his fellow-citizens; and Caius is reported to have avoided all 
<A NAME="96"></A>manner of resistance, even when his life was aimed at, showing himself 
<A NAME="97"></A>always valiant against a foreign enemy, but wholly inactive in a sedition. 
<A NAME="98"></A>This was the reason that he went from his own house unarmed, and withdrew 
<A NAME="99"></A>when the battle began, and in all respects showed himself anxious rather 
<A NAME="100"></A>not to do any harm to others, than not to suffer any himself. Even the 
<A NAME="101"></A>very flight of the Gracchi must not be looked upon as an argument of their 
<A NAME="102"></A>mean spirit, but an honourable retreat from endangering of others. For 
<A NAME="103"></A>if they had stayed, they must either have yielded to those who assailed 
<A NAME="104"></A>them, or else have fought them in their own defence.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR>The greatest crime that can be laid to Tiberius's charge was the 
<A NAME="106"></A>deposing of his fellow tribune, and seeking afterwards a second tribuneship 
<A NAME="107"></A>for himself. As for the death of Antyllius, it is falsely and unjustly 
<A NAME="108"></A>attributed to Caius, for he was slain unknown to him, and much to his grief. 
<A NAME="109"></A>On the contrary, Cleomenes (not to mention the murder of the Ephors) set 
<A NAME="110"></A>all the slaves at liberty, and governed by himself alone in reality, having 
<A NAME="111"></A>a partner only for show; having made choice of his brother Euclidas, who 
<A NAME="112"></A>was one of the same family. He prevailed upon Archidamus, who was the right 
<A NAME="113"></A>heir to the kingdom of the other line, to venture to return home from Messene; 
<A NAME="114"></A>but after his being slain, by not doing anything to revenge his death, 
<A NAME="115"></A>confirmed the suspicion that he was privy to it himself. Lycurgus, whose 
<A NAME="116"></A>example he professed to imitate, after he had voluntarily settled his kingdom 
<A NAME="117"></A>upon Charillus, his brother's son, fearing lest, if the youth should chance 
<A NAME="118"></A>to die by accident, he might be suspected for it, travelled a long time, 
<A NAME="119"></A>and would not return again to Sparta until Charillus had a son, and an 
<A NAME="120"></A>heir to his kingdom. But we have indeed no other Grecian who is worthy 
<A NAME="121"></A>to be compared with Lycurgus, and it is clear enough that in the public 
<A NAME="122"></A>measures of Cleomenes various acts of considerable audacity and lawlessness 
<A NAME="123"></A>may be found.
<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR>Those, therefore, who incline to blame their characters may observe, 
<A NAME="125"></A>that the two Grecians were disturbers even from their youth, lovers of 
<A NAME="126"></A>contest, and aspirants to despotic power; that Tiberius and Caius by nature 
<A NAME="127"></A>had an excessive desire after glory and honours. Beyond this, their enemies 
<A NAME="128"></A>could find nothing to bring against them; but as soon as the contention 
<A NAME="129"></A>began with their adversaries, their heat and passions would so far prevail 
<A NAME="130"></A>beyond their natural temper, that by them, as by ill winds, they were driven 
<A NAME="131"></A>afterwards to all their rash undertakings. What could be more just and 
<A NAME="132"></A>honourable than their first design, had not the power and the faction of 
<A NAME="133"></A>the rich, by endeavouring to abrogate that law, engaged them both in those 
<A NAME="134"></A>fatal quarrels, the one, for his own preservation, the other, to revenge 
<A NAME="135"></A>his brother's death, who was murdered without any law or 
<A NAME="136"></A>justice?
<A NAME="137"></A><BR><BR>From the account, therefore, which has been given, you yourself 
<A NAME="138"></A>may perceive the difference; which if it were to be pronounced of every 
<A NAME="139"></A>one singly, I should affirm Tiberius to have excelled them all in virtue; 
<A NAME="140"></A>that young Agis had been guilty of the fewest misdeeds; and that in action 
<A NAME="141"></A>and boldness Caius came far short of Cleomenes.
