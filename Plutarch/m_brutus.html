<A NAME="2"></A>
<BR>(legendary, died 42 B.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Marcus Brutus was descended from that Junius Brutus to whom the ancient 
<A NAME="11"></A>Romans erected a statue of brass in the capitol among the images of their 
<A NAME="12"></A>kings with a drawn sword in his hand, in remembrance of his courage and 
<A NAME="13"></A>resolution in expelling the Tarquins and destroying the monarchy. But that 
<A NAME="14"></A>ancient Brutus was of a severe and inflexible nature, like steel of too 
<A NAME="15"></A>hard a temper, and having never had his character softened by study and 
<A NAME="16"></A>thought, he let himself be so far transported with his rage and hatred 
<A NAME="17"></A>against tyrants that, for conspiring with them, he proceeded to the execution 
<A NAME="18"></A>even of his own sons. But this Brutus, whose life we now write, having 
<A NAME="19"></A>to the goodness of his disposition added the improvements of learning and 
<A NAME="20"></A>the study of philosophy, and having stirred up his natural parts, of themselves 
<A NAME="21"></A>grave and gentle, by applying himself to business and public affairs, seems 
<A NAME="22"></A>to have been of a temper exactly framed for virtue; insomuch that they 
<A NAME="23"></A>who were most his enemies upon account of his conspiracy against Caesar, 
<A NAME="24"></A>if in that whole affair there was any honourable or generous part, referred 
<A NAME="25"></A>it wholly to Brutus, and laid whatever was barbarous and cruel to the charge 
<A NAME="26"></A>of Cassius, Brutus's connection and familiar friend, but not his equal 
<A NAME="27"></A>in honesty and pureness of purpose. His mother, Servilia, was of the family 
<A NAME="28"></A>of Servilius Ahala, who when Spurius Maelius worked the people into a rebellion 
<A NAME="29"></A>and designed to make himself king, taking a dagger under his arm, went 
<A NAME="30"></A>forth into the market-place, and upon pretence of having some private business 
<A NAME="31"></A>with him, came up close to him, and, as he bent his head to hear what he 
<A NAME="32"></A>had to say, struck him with his dagger and slew him. And thus much, as 
<A NAME="33"></A>concerns his descent by the mother's side, is confessed by all; but as 
<A NAME="34"></A>for his father's family, they who for Caesar's murder bore any hatred or 
<A NAME="35"></A>ill-will to Brutus say that he came not from that Brutus who expelled the 
<A NAME="36"></A>Tarquins, there being none of his race left after the execution of his 
<A NAME="37"></A>two sons; but that his ancestor was a plebeian, son of one Brutus, a steward, 
<A NAME="38"></A>and only rose in the latest times to office or dignity in the commonwealth. 
<A NAME="39"></A>But Posidonius the philosopher writes that it is true indeed what the history 
<A NAME="40"></A>relates, that two of the sons of Brutus who were of men's estate were put 
<A NAME="41"></A>to death, but that a third, yet an infant, was left alive, from whom the 
<A NAME="42"></A>family was propagated down to Marcus Brutus; and further, that there were 
<A NAME="43"></A>several famous persons of this house in his time whose looks very much 
<A NAME="44"></A>resembled the statue of Junius Brutus. But of this subject 
<A NAME="45"></A>enough.
<A NAME="46"></A><BR><BR>Cato the philosopher was brother to Servilia, the mother of Brutus, 
<A NAME="47"></A>and he it was whom of all the Romans his nephew most admired and studied 
<A NAME="48"></A>to imitate, and he afterwards married his daughter Porcia. Of all the sects 
<A NAME="49"></A>of the Greek philosophers, though there was none of which he had not been 
<A NAME="50"></A>a hearer, and in which he had not made some proficiency, yet he chiefly 
<A NAME="51"></A>esteemed the Platonists; and not much approving of the modern and middle 
<A NAME="52"></A>Academy, as it is called, he applied himself to the study of the ancient. 
<A NAME="53"></A>He was all his lifetime a great admirer of Antiochus of the city of Ascalon, 
<A NAME="54"></A>and took his brother Aristus into his own house for his friend and companion, 
<A NAME="55"></A>a man for his learning inferior indeed to many of the philosophers, but 
<A NAME="56"></A>for the evenness of his temper and steadiness of his conduct equal to the 
<A NAME="57"></A>best. As for Empylus, of whom he himself and his friends often make mention 
<A NAME="58"></A>in their epistles, as one that lived with Brutus, he was a rhetorician, 
<A NAME="59"></A>and has left behind him a short but well-written history of the death of 
<A NAME="60"></A>Caesar, entitled Brutus.
<A NAME="61"></A><BR><BR>In Latin, he had by exercise attained a sufficient skill to be 
<A NAME="62"></A>able to make public addresses and to plead a cause; but in Greek, he must 
<A NAME="63"></A>be noted for affecting the sententious and short Laconic way of speaking 
<A NAME="64"></A>in sundry passages of his epistles; as when, in the beginning of the war, 
<A NAME="65"></A>he wrote thus to the Pergamenians: "I hear you have given Dolabella money; 
<A NAME="66"></A>if willingly, you must own you have injured me; if unwillingly, show it 
<A NAME="67"></A>by giving willingly to me." And another time to the Samians: "Your counsels 
<A NAME="68"></A>are remiss and your performances slow; what think ye will be the end?" 
<A NAME="69"></A>And of the Patareans thus: "The Xanthians, suspecting my kindness, have 
<A NAME="70"></A>made their country the grave of their despair; the Patareans, trusting 
<A NAME="71"></A>themselves to me, enjoy in all points their former liberty; it is in your 
<A NAME="72"></A>power to choose the judgment of the Patareans on the pretence of the Xanthians." 
<A NAME="73"></A>And this is the style for which some of his letters are to be 
<A NAME="74"></A>noted.
<A NAME="75"></A><BR><BR>When he was but a very young man, he accompanied his uncle Cato 
<A NAME="76"></A>to Cyprus, when he was sent there against Ptolemy. But when Ptolemy killed 
<A NAME="77"></A>himself, Cato, being by some necessary business detained in the isle of 
<A NAME="78"></A>Rhodes, had already sent one of his friends, named Canidius, to take into 
<A NAME="79"></A>his care and keeping the treasure of the king; but presently, not feeling 
<A NAME="80"></A>sure of his honesty, he wrote to Brutus to sail immediately for Cyprus 
<A NAME="81"></A>out of Pamphylia, where he then was staying to refresh himself, being but 
<A NAME="82"></A>just recovered of a fit of sickness. He obeyed his orders, but with a great 
<A NAME="83"></A>deal of unwillingness, as well out of respect to Canidius, who was thrown 
<A NAME="84"></A>out of this employment by Cato with so much disgrace, as also because he 
<A NAME="85"></A>esteemed such a commission mean and unsuitable to him, who was in the prime 
<A NAME="86"></A>of his youth, and given to books and study. Nevertheless, applying himself 
<A NAME="87"></A>to the business, he behaved himself so well in it that he was highly commended 
<A NAME="88"></A>by Cato, and having turned all the goods of Ptolemy into ready money, he 
<A NAME="89"></A>sailed with the greatest part of it in his own ship to 
<A NAME="90"></A>Rome.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR>But upon the general separation into two factions, when, Pompey 
<A NAME="92"></A>and Caesar taking up arms against one another, the whole empire was turned 
<A NAME="93"></A>into confusion, it was commonly believed that he would take Caesar's side; 
<A NAME="94"></A>for his father in past time had been put to death by Pompey. But he, thinking 
<A NAME="95"></A>it his duty to prefer the interest of the public to his own private feelings, 
<A NAME="96"></A>and judging Pompey's to be the better cause, took part with him; though 
<A NAME="97"></A>formerly he used not so much as to salute or take any notice of Pompey, 
<A NAME="98"></A>if he happened to meet him, esteeming it a pollution to have the least 
<A NAME="99"></A>conversation with the murderer of his father. But now, looking upon him 
<A NAME="100"></A>as the general of his country, he placed himself under his command, and 
<A NAME="101"></A>set sail for Cilicia in quality of lieutenant to Sestius, who had the government 
<A NAME="102"></A>of that province. But finding no opportunity there of doing any great service, 
<A NAME="103"></A>and hearing that Pompey and Caesar were now near one another and preparing 
<A NAME="104"></A>for the battle upon which all depended, he came of his own accord to Macedonia 
<A NAME="105"></A>to partake in the danger. At his coming it is said that Pompey was so surprised 
<A NAME="106"></A>and so pleased that, rising from his chair in the sight of all who were 
<A NAME="107"></A>about him, he saluted and embraced him, as one of the chiefest of his party. 
<A NAME="108"></A>All the time that he was in the camp, excepting that which he spent in 
<A NAME="109"></A>Pompey's company, he employed in reading and in study, which he did not 
<A NAME="110"></A>neglect even the day before the great battle. It was the middle of summer, 
<A NAME="111"></A>and the heat was very great, the camp having been pitched near some marshy 
<A NAME="112"></A>ground, and the people that carried Brutus's tent were a long while before 
<A NAME="113"></A>they came. Yet though upon these accounts he was extremely harassed and 
<A NAME="114"></A>out of order, having scarcely by the middle of the day anointed himself 
<A NAME="115"></A>and eaten a sparing meal, whilst most others were either laid to sleep 
<A NAME="116"></A>or taken up with the thoughts and apprehensions of what would be the issue 
<A NAME="117"></A>of the fight, he spent his time until the evening in writing an epitome 
<A NAME="118"></A>of Polybius.
<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR>It is said that Caesar had so great a regard for him that he ordered 
<A NAME="120"></A>his commanders by no means to kill Brutus in the battle, but to spare him, 
<A NAME="121"></A>if possible, and bring him safe to him, if he would willingly surrender 
<A NAME="122"></A>himself; but if he made any resistance, to suffer him to escape rather 
<A NAME="123"></A>than do him any violence. And this he is believed to have done out of a 
<A NAME="124"></A>tenderness to Servilia, the mother of Brutus; for Caesar had, it seems, 
<A NAME="125"></A>in his youth been very intimate with her, and she passionately in love 
<A NAME="126"></A>with him; and, considering that Brutus was born about that time in which 
<A NAME="127"></A>their loves were at the highest, Caesar had a belief that he was his own 
<A NAME="128"></A>child. The story is told that, when the great question of the conspiracy 
<A NAME="129"></A>of Catiline, which had like to have been the destruction of the commonwealth, 
<A NAME="130"></A>was debated in the senate, Cato and Caesar were both standing up, contending 
<A NAME="131"></A>together on the decision to be come to; at which time a little note was 
<A NAME="132"></A>delivered to Caesar from without, which he took and read silently to himself. 
<A NAME="133"></A>Upon this, Cato cried out aloud, and accused Caesar of holding correspondence 
<A NAME="134"></A>with and receiving letters from the enemies of the commonwealth; and when 
<A NAME="135"></A>many other senators exclaimed against it, Caesar delivered the note as 
<A NAME="136"></A>he had received it to Cato, who reading it found it to be a love-letter 
<A NAME="137"></A>from his own sister Servilia, and threw it back again to Caesar with the 
<A NAME="138"></A>words, "Keep it, you drunkard," and returned to the subject of the debate. 
<A NAME="139"></A>So public and notorious was Servilia's love to Caesar.
<A NAME="140"></A><BR><BR>After the great overthrow at Pharsalia, Pompey himself having made 
<A NAME="141"></A>his escape to the sea, and Caesar's army storming the camp, Brutus stole 
<A NAME="142"></A>privately out by one of the gates leading to marshy ground full of water 
<A NAME="143"></A>and covered with reeds, and, travelling through the night, got safe to 
<A NAME="144"></A>Larissa. From Larissa he wrote to Caesar who expressed a great deal of 
<A NAME="145"></A>joy to hear that he was safe, and, bidding him come, not only forgave him 
<A NAME="146"></A>freely, but honoured and esteemed him among his chiefest friends. Now when 
<A NAME="147"></A>nobody could give any certain account which way Pompey had fled, Caesar 
<A NAME="148"></A>took a little journey along with Brutus, and tried what was his opinion 
<A NAME="149"></A>herein, and after some discussion which passed between them, believing 
<A NAME="150"></A>that Brutus's conjecture was the right one, laying aside all other thoughts, 
<A NAME="151"></A>he set out directly to pursue him towards Egypt. But Pompey, having reached 
<A NAME="152"></A>Egypt, as Brutus guessed his design was to do, there met his 
<A NAME="153"></A>fate.
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR>Brutus in the meantime gained Caesar's forgiveness for his friend 
<A NAME="155"></A>Cassius; and pleading also in defence of the king of the Lybians, though 
<A NAME="156"></A>he was overwhelmed with the greatness of the crimes alleged against him, 
<A NAME="157"></A>yet by his entreaties and deprecations to Caesar in his behalf, he preserved 
<A NAME="158"></A>to him a great part of his kingdom. It is reported that Caesar, when he 
<A NAME="159"></A>first heard Brutus speak in public, said to his friends, "I know not what 
<A NAME="160"></A>this young man intends, but, whatever he intends, he intends vehemently." 
<A NAME="161"></A>For his natural firmness of mind, not easily yielding, or complying in 
<A NAME="162"></A>favour of every one that entreated his kindness, once set into action upon 
<A NAME="163"></A>motives of right reason and deliberate moral choice, whatever direction 
<A NAME="164"></A>it thus took, it was pretty sure to take effectively, and to work in such 
<A NAME="165"></A>a way as not to fail in its object. No flattery could ever prevail with 
<A NAME="166"></A>him to listen to unjust petitions: and he held that to be overcome by the 
<A NAME="167"></A>importunities of shameless and fawning entreaties, though some compliment 
<A NAME="168"></A>it with the name of modesty and bashfulness, was the worst disgrace a great 
<A NAME="169"></A>man could suffer. And he used to say that he always felt as if they who 
<A NAME="170"></A>could deny nothing could not have behaved well in the flower of their 
<A NAME="171"></A>youth.
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, being about to make his expedition into Africa against 
<A NAME="173"></A>Cato and Scipio, committed to Brutus the government of Cisalpine Gaul, 
<A NAME="174"></A>to the great happiness and advantage of that province. For while people 
<A NAME="175"></A>in other provinces were in distress with the violence and avarice of their 
<A NAME="176"></A>governors, and suffered as much oppression as if they had been slaves and 
<A NAME="177"></A>captives of war, Brutus, by his easy government, actually made them amends 
<A NAME="178"></A>for their calamities under former rulers, directing moreover all their 
<A NAME="179"></A>gratitude for his good deeds to Caesar himself; insomuch that it was a 
<A NAME="180"></A>most welcome and pleasant spectacle to Caesar, when in his return he passed 
<A NAME="181"></A>through Italy, to see the cities that were under Brutus's command, and 
<A NAME="182"></A>Brutus himself increasing his honour and joining agreeably in his 
<A NAME="183"></A>progress.
<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR>Now several praetorships being vacant, it was all men's opinion 
<A NAME="185"></A>that that of the chiefest dignity, which is called the praetorship of the 
<A NAME="186"></A>city, would be conferred either upon Brutus or Cassius; and some say that, 
<A NAME="187"></A>there having been some little difference upon former accounts between them, 
<A NAME="188"></A>this competition set them much more at variance, though they were connected 
<A NAME="189"></A>in their families, Cassius having married Junia, the sister of Brutus. 
<A NAME="190"></A>Others say that the contention was raised between them by Caesar's doing, 
<A NAME="191"></A>who had privately given each of them such hopes of his favour as led them 
<A NAME="192"></A>on, and provoked them at last into this open competition and trial of their 
<A NAME="193"></A>interest. Brutus had only the reputation of his honour and virtue to oppose 
<A NAME="194"></A>to the many and gallant actions performed by Cassius against the Parthians. 
<A NAME="195"></A>But Caesar, having heard each side, and deliberating about the matter among 
<A NAME="196"></A>his friends, said, "Cassius has the stronger plea, but we must let Brutus 
<A NAME="197"></A>be first praetor." So another praetorship was given to Cassius; the gaining 
<A NAME="198"></A>of which could not so much oblige him, as he was incensed for the loss 
<A NAME="199"></A>of the other. And in all other things Brutus was partaker of Caesar's power 
<A NAME="200"></A>as much as he desired: for he might, if he had pleased, have been the chief 
<A NAME="201"></A>of all his friends, and had authority and command beyond them all, but 
<A NAME="202"></A>Cassius and the company he met with him drew him off from Caesar. Indeed, 
<A NAME="203"></A>he was not yet wholly reconciled to Cassius, since that competition which 
<A NAME="204"></A>was between them: but yet he gave ear to Cassius's friends, who were perpetually 
<A NAME="205"></A>advising him not to be so blind as to suffer himself to be softened and 
<A NAME="206"></A>won over by Caesar, but to shun the kindness and favours of a tyrant, which 
<A NAME="207"></A>they intimated that Caesar showed him, not to express any honour to his 
<A NAME="208"></A>merit or virtue, but to unbend his strength, and undermine his vigour of 
<A NAME="209"></A>purpose.
<A NAME="210"></A><BR><BR>Neither was Caesar wholly without suspicion of him, nor wanted 
<A NAME="211"></A>informers that accused Brutus to him; but he feared, indeed, the high spirit 
<A NAME="212"></A>and the great character and the friends that he had, but thought himself 
<A NAME="213"></A>secure in his moral disposition. When it was told him that Antony and Dolabella 
<A NAME="214"></A>designed some disturbance, "It is not," said he, "the fat and the long-haired 
<A NAME="215"></A>men that I fear, but the pale and the lean," meaning Brutus and Cassius. 
<A NAME="216"></A>And when some maligned Brutus to him, and advised him to beware of him, 
<A NAME="217"></A>taking hold of his flesh with his hand, "What," he said, "do you think 
<A NAME="218"></A>that Brutus will not wait out the time of this little body?" as if he thought 
<A NAME="219"></A>none so fit to succeed him in his power as Brutus. And indeed it seems 
<A NAME="220"></A>to be without doubt that Brutus might have been the first man in the commonwealth, 
<A NAME="221"></A>if he had had patience but a little time to be second to Caesar, and would 
<A NAME="222"></A>have suffered his power to decline after it was come to its highest pitch, 
<A NAME="223"></A>and the fame of his great actions to die away by degrees. But Cassius, 
<A NAME="224"></A>a man of a fierce disposition, and one that out of private malice, rather 
<A NAME="225"></A>than love of the public, hated Caesar, not the tyrant, continually fired 
<A NAME="226"></A>and stirred him up. Brutus felt the rule an oppression, but Cassius hated 
<A NAME="227"></A>the ruler; and, among other reasons on which he grounded his quarrel against 
<A NAME="228"></A>Caesar, the loss of his lions which he had procured when he was aedile-elect 
<A NAME="229"></A>was one; for Caesar, finding these in Megara, when that city was taken 
<A NAME="230"></A>by Calenus, seized them to himself. These beasts, they say, were a great 
<A NAME="231"></A>calamity to the Megarians; for, when their city was just taken, they broke 
<A NAME="232"></A>open the lions' dens, and pulled off their chains and let them loose that 
<A NAME="233"></A>they might run upon the enemy that was entering the city; but the lions 
<A NAME="234"></A>turned upon them themselves, and tore to pieces a great many unarmed persons 
<A NAME="235"></A>running about, so that it was a miserable spectacle even to their enemies 
<A NAME="236"></A>to behold.
<A NAME="237"></A><BR><BR>And this, some say, was the chief provocation that stirred up Cassius 
<A NAME="238"></A>to conspire against Caesar; but they are much in the wrong. For Cassius 
<A NAME="239"></A>had from his youth a natural hatred and rancour against the whole race 
<A NAME="240"></A>of tyrants, which he showed when he was but a boy, and went to the same 
<A NAME="241"></A>school with Faustus, the son of Sylla; for, on his boasting himself amongst 
<A NAME="242"></A>the boys, and extolling the sovereign power of his father, Cassius rose 
<A NAME="243"></A>up and struck him two or three boxes on the ear; which when the guardians 
<A NAME="244"></A>and relations of Faustus designed to inquire into and to prosecute, Pompey 
<A NAME="245"></A>forbade them, and, sending for both the boys together, examined the matter 
<A NAME="246"></A>himself. And Cassius is then reported to have said thus, "Come, then, Faustus, 
<A NAME="247"></A>dare to speak here those words that provoked me, that I may strike you 
<A NAME="248"></A>again as I did before." Such was the disposition of 
<A NAME="249"></A>Cassius.
<A NAME="250"></A><BR><BR>But Brutus was roused up and pushed on to the undertaking by many 
<A NAME="251"></A>persuasions of his familiar friends, and letters and invitations from unknown 
<A NAME="252"></A>citizens. For under the statue of his ancestor Brutus, that overthrew the 
<A NAME="253"></A>kingly government, they wrote the words, "O that we had a Brutus now!" 
<A NAME="254"></A>and, "O that Brutus were alive!" And Brutus's own tribunal, on which he 
<A NAME="255"></A>sat as praetor, was filled each morning with writings such as these: "You 
<A NAME="256"></A>are asleep, Brutus," and, "You are not a true Brutus." Now the flatterers 
<A NAME="257"></A>of Caesar were the occasion of all this, who, among other invidious honours 
<A NAME="258"></A>which they strove to fasten upon Caesar, crowned his statues by night with 
<A NAME="259"></A>diadems, wishing to incite the people to salute him king instead of dictator. 
<A NAME="260"></A>But quite the contrary came to pass, as I have more particularly related 
<A NAME="261"></A>in the life of Caesar.
<A NAME="262"></A><BR><BR>When Cassius went about soliciting friends to engage in this design 
<A NAME="263"></A>against Caesar, all whom he tried readily consented, if Brutus would be 
<A NAME="264"></A>head of it; for their opinion was that the enterprise wanted not hands 
<A NAME="265"></A>or resolution, but the reputation and authority of a man such as he was, 
<A NAME="266"></A>to give as it were the first religious sanction, and by his presence, if 
<A NAME="267"></A>by nothing else, to justify the undertaking; that without him they should 
<A NAME="268"></A>go about this action with less heart, and should lie under greater suspicions 
<A NAME="269"></A>when they had done it; for if their cause had been just and honourable, 
<A NAME="270"></A>people would be sure that Brutus would not have refused it. Cassius, having 
<A NAME="271"></A>considered these things with himself, went to Brutus and made him the first 
<A NAME="272"></A>visit after their falling out; and after the compliments of reconciliation 
<A NAME="273"></A>had passed, and former kindnesses were renewed between them, he asked him 
<A NAME="274"></A>if he designed to be present on the calends of March, for it was discoursed, 
<A NAME="275"></A>he said, that Caesar's friends intended then to move that he might be made 
<A NAME="276"></A>king. When Brutus answered, that he would not be there, "But what," says 
<A NAME="277"></A>Cassius, "if they should send for us?" "It will be my business, then," 
<A NAME="278"></A>replied Brutus, "not to hold my peace, but to stand up boldly, and die 
<A NAME="279"></A>for the liberty of my country." To which Cassius with some emotion answered, 
<A NAME="280"></A>"But what Roman will suffer you to die? What, do you not know yourself, 
<A NAME="281"></A>Brutus? Or do you think that those writings that you find upon your praetor's 
<A NAME="282"></A>seat were put there by weavers and shopkeepers, and not by the first and 
<A NAME="283"></A>most powerful men of Rome? From other praetors, indeed, they expect largesses 
<A NAME="284"></A>and shows and gladiators, but from you they claim, as an hereditary debt, 
<A NAME="285"></A>the exurpation of tyranny; they are all ready to suffer anything on your 
<A NAME="286"></A>account, if you will but show yourself such as they think you are and expect 
<A NAME="287"></A>you should be." Which said, he fell upon Brutus, and embraced him; and 
<A NAME="288"></A>after this, they parted each to try their several friends.
<A NAME="289"></A><BR><BR>Among the friends of Pompey there was one Caius Ligarius, whom 
<A NAME="290"></A>Caesar had pardoned, though accused for having been in arms against him. 
<A NAME="291"></A>This man, not feeling so thankful for having been forgiven as he felt oppressed 
<A NAME="292"></A>by that power which made him need a pardon, hated Caesar, and was one of 
<A NAME="293"></A>Brutus's most intimate friends. Him Brutus visited, and finding him sick, 
<A NAME="294"></A>"O Ligarius," says he, "what a time you have found out to be sick in!" 
<A NAME="295"></A>At which words Ligarius, raising himself and leaning on his elbow, took 
<A NAME="296"></A>Brutus by the hand, and said, "But, O Brutus, if you are on any design 
<A NAME="297"></A>worthy of yourself, I am well."
<A NAME="298"></A><BR><BR>From this time they tried the inclinations of all their acquaintances 
<A NAME="299"></A>that they durst trust, and communicated the secret to them, and took into 
<A NAME="300"></A>the design not only their familiar friends, but as many as they believed 
<A NAME="301"></A>bold and brave and despisers of death. For which reason they concealed 
<A NAME="302"></A>the plot from Cicero, though he was very much trusted and as well beloved 
<A NAME="303"></A>by them all, lest, to his own disposition, which was naturally timorous, 
<A NAME="304"></A>adding now the weariness and caution of old age, by his weighing, as he 
<A NAME="305"></A>would do, every particular, that he might not make one step without the 
<A NAME="306"></A>greatest security, he should blunt the edge of their forwardness and resolution 
<A NAME="307"></A>in a business which required all the despatch imaginable. As indeed there 
<A NAME="308"></A>were also two others that were companions of Brutus, Statilius the Epicurean, 
<A NAME="309"></A>and Favonius the admirer of Cato, whom he left out for this reason: as 
<A NAME="310"></A>he was conversing one day with them, trying them at a distance, and proposing 
<A NAME="311"></A>some such question to be disputed of as among philosophers, to see what 
<A NAME="312"></A>opinion they were of, Favonius declared his judgment to be that a civil 
<A NAME="313"></A>war was worse than the most illegal monarchy; and Statilius held, that 
<A NAME="314"></A>to bring himself into troubles and danger upon the account of evil or foolish 
<A NAME="315"></A>men did not become a man that had any wisdom or discretion. But Labeo, 
<A NAME="316"></A>who was present, contradicted them both and Brutus, as if it had been an 
<A NAME="317"></A>intricate dispute, and difficult to be decided, held his peace for that 
<A NAME="318"></A>time, but afterwards discovered the whole design to Labeo, who readily 
<A NAME="319"></A>undertook it. The next thing that was thought convenient was to gain the 
<A NAME="320"></A>other Brutus surnamed Albinus, a man of himself of no great bravery or 
<A NAME="321"></A>courage, but considerable for the number of gladiators that he was maintaining 
<A NAME="322"></A>for a public show, and the great confidence that Caesar put in him. When 
<A NAME="323"></A>Cassius and Labeo spoke with him concerning the matter, he gave them no 
<A NAME="324"></A>answer; but, seeking an interview with Brutus himself alone, and finding 
<A NAME="325"></A>that he was their captain, he readily consented to partake in the action. 
<A NAME="326"></A>And among the others, also, the most and best were gained by the name of 
<A NAME="327"></A>Brutus. And, though they neither gave nor took any oath of secrecy, nor 
<A NAME="328"></A>used any other sacred rite to assure their fidelity to each other, yet 
<A NAME="329"></A>all kept their design so close, were so wary, and held it so silently among 
<A NAME="330"></A>themselves that, though by prophecies and apparitions and signs in the 
<A NAME="331"></A>sacrifices the gods gave warning of it, yet could it not be 
<A NAME="332"></A>believed.
<A NAME="333"></A><BR><BR>Now Brutus, feeling that the noblest spirits of Rome for virtue 
<A NAME="334"></A>birth, or courage were depending upon him, and surveying with himself all 
<A NAME="335"></A>the circumstances of the dangers they were to encounter, strove indeed, 
<A NAME="336"></A>as much as possible, when abroad, to keep his uneasiness of mind to himself, 
<A NAME="337"></A>and to compose his thoughts; but at home, and especially at night, he was 
<A NAME="338"></A>not the same man, but sometimes against his will his working care would 
<A NAME="339"></A>make him start out of his sleep, and other times he was taken up with further 
<A NAME="340"></A>reflection and consideration of his difficulties, so that his wife that 
<A NAME="341"></A>lay with him could not choose but take notice that he was full of unusual 
<A NAME="342"></A>trouble, and had in agitation some dangerous and perplexing question. Porcia, 
<A NAME="343"></A>as was said before, was the daughter of Cato, and Brutus, her cousin-german, 
<A NAME="344"></A>had married her very young, though not a maid, but after the death of her 
<A NAME="345"></A>former husband, by whom she had one son that was named Bibulus; and there 
<A NAME="346"></A>is a little book, called Memoirs of Brutus, written by him, yet extant. 
<A NAME="347"></A>This Porcia, being addicted to philosophy, a great lover of her husband, 
<A NAME="348"></A>and full of an understanding courage, resolved not to inquire into Brutus's 
<A NAME="349"></A>secrets before she had made this trial of herself. She turned all her attendants 
<A NAME="350"></A>out of her chamber, and taking a little knife, such as they use to cut 
<A NAME="351"></A>nails with, she gave herself a deep gash in the thigh; upon which followed 
<A NAME="352"></A>a great flow of blood, and soon after, violent pains and a shivering fever, 
<A NAME="353"></A>occasioned by the wound. Now when Brutus was extremely anxious and afflicted 
<A NAME="354"></A>for her, she, in the height of all her pain, spoke thus to him: "I, Brutus, 
<A NAME="355"></A>being the daughter of Cato, was given to you in marriage, not like a concubine, 
<A NAME="356"></A>to partake only in the common intercourse of bed and board, but to bear 
<A NAME="357"></A>a part in all your good and all your evil fortunes; and for your part, 
<A NAME="358"></A>as regards your care for me, I find no reason to complain; but from me, 
<A NAME="359"></A>what evidence of my love, what satisfaction can you receive, if I may not 
<A NAME="360"></A>share with you in bearing your hidden griefs, nor to be admitted to any 
<A NAME="361"></A>of your counsels that require secrecy and trust? I know very well that 
<A NAME="362"></A>women seem to be of too weak a nature to be trusted with secrets; but certainly, 
<A NAME="363"></A>Brutus, a virtuous birth and education, and the company of the good and 
<A NAME="364"></A>honourable, are of some force to the forming our manners; and I can boast 
<A NAME="365"></A>that I am the daughter of Cato, and the wife of Brutus, in which two titles 
<A NAME="366"></A>though before I put less confidence, yet now I have tried myself, and find 
<A NAME="367"></A>that I can bid defiance to pain." Which words having spoken, she showed 
<A NAME="368"></A>him her wound, and related to him the trial that she had made of her constancy; 
<A NAME="369"></A>at which he being astonished, lifted up his hands to heaven, and begged 
<A NAME="370"></A>the assistance of the gods in his enterprise, that he might show himself 
<A NAME="371"></A>a husband worthy of such a wife as Porcia. So then he comforted his 
<A NAME="372"></A>wife.
<A NAME="373"></A><BR><BR>But a meeting of the senate being appointed, at which it was believed 
<A NAME="374"></A>that Caesar would be present, they agreed to make use of that opportunity; 
<A NAME="375"></A>for then they might appear all together without suspicion; and, besides, 
<A NAME="376"></A>they hoped that all the noblest and leading men of the commonwealth, being 
<A NAME="377"></A>then assembled as soon as the great deed was done, would immediately stand 
<A NAME="378"></A>forward and assert the common liberty. The very place too where the senate 
<A NAME="379"></A>was to meet seemed to be by divine appointment favourable to their purpose. 
<A NAME="380"></A>It was a portico, one of those joining the theatre, with a large recess, 
<A NAME="381"></A>in which there stood a statue of Pompey, erected to him by the commonwealth, 
<A NAME="382"></A>when he adorned that part of the city with the porticos and the theatre. 
<A NAME="383"></A>To this place it was that the senate was summoned for the middle of March 
<A NAME="384"></A>(the Ides of March is the Roman name for the day); as if some more than 
<A NAME="385"></A>human power were leading the man thither, there to meet his punishment 
<A NAME="386"></A>for the death of Pompey.
<A NAME="387"></A><BR><BR>As soon as it was day, Brutus, taking with him a dagger, which 
<A NAME="388"></A>none but his wife knew of, went out. The rest met together at Cassius's 
<A NAME="389"></A>house, and brought forth his son that was that day to put on the manly 
<A NAME="390"></A>gown, as it is called, into the forum; and from thence, going all to Pompey's 
<A NAME="391"></A>porch, stayed there, expecting Caesar to come without delay to the senate. 
<A NAME="392"></A>Here it was chiefly that any one who had known what they had purposed, 
<A NAME="393"></A>would have admired the unconcerned temper and the steady resolution of 
<A NAME="394"></A>these men in their most dangerous undertaking; for many of them, being 
<A NAME="395"></A>praetors, and called upon by their office to judge and determine causes, 
<A NAME="396"></A>did not only hear calmly all that made application to them and pleaded 
<A NAME="397"></A>against each other before them, as if they were free from all other thoughts, 
<A NAME="398"></A>but decided causes with as much accuracy and judgment as they had heard 
<A NAME="399"></A>them with attention and patience. And when one person refused to stand 
<A NAME="400"></A>to the award of Brutus, and with great clamour and many attestations appealed 
<A NAME="401"></A>to Caesar, Brutus, looking round about him upon those that were present, 
<A NAME="402"></A>said, "Caesar does not hinder me, nor will he hinder me, from doing according 
<A NAME="403"></A>to the laws."
<A NAME="404"></A><BR><BR>Yet there were many unusual accidents that disturbed them and by 
<A NAME="405"></A>mere chance were thrown in their way. The first and chiefest was the long 
<A NAME="406"></A>stay of Caesar, though the day was spent, and he being detained at home 
<A NAME="407"></A>by his wife, and forbidden by the soothsayers to go forth, upon some defect 
<A NAME="408"></A>that appeared in his sacrifice. Another was this: There came a man up to 
<A NAME="409"></A>Casca, one of the company, and, taking him by the hand, "You concealed," 
<A NAME="410"></A>said he, "the secret from us, but Brutus has told me all." At which words 
<A NAME="411"></A>when Casca was surprised, the other said laughing, "How came you to be 
<A NAME="412"></A>so rich of a sudden, that you should stand to be chosen aedile?" So near 
<A NAME="413"></A>was Casca to let out the secret, upon the mere ambiguity of the other's 
<A NAME="414"></A>expression. Then Popilius Laenas, a senator, having saluted Brutus and 
<A NAME="415"></A>Cassius more earnestly than usual, whispered them softly in the ear, and 
<A NAME="416"></A>said, "My wishes are with you, that you may accomplish what you design, 
<A NAME="417"></A>and I advise you to make no delay, for the thing is now no secret." This 
<A NAME="418"></A>said, he departed, and left them in great suspicion that the design had 
<A NAME="419"></A>taken wind. In the meanwhile, there came one in haste from Brutus's house 
<A NAME="420"></A>and brought him news that his wife was dying. For Porcia, being extremely 
<A NAME="421"></A>disturbed with expectation of the event, and not able to bear the greatness 
<A NAME="422"></A>of her anxiety, could scarce keep herself within doors; and at every little 
<A NAME="423"></A>noise or voice she heard, starting up suddenly, like those possessed with 
<A NAME="424"></A>the bacchic frenzy, she asked every one that came in from the forum what 
<A NAME="425"></A>Brutus was doing, and sent one messenger after another to inquire. At last, 
<A NAME="426"></A>after long expectation and waiting, the strength of her constitution could 
<A NAME="427"></A>hold out no longer; her mind was overcome with her doubts and fears, and 
<A NAME="428"></A>she lost the control of herself, and began to faint away. She had not time 
<A NAME="429"></A>to betake herself to her chamber, but, sitting as she was amongst her women, 
<A NAME="430"></A>a sudden swoon and a great stupor seized her, and her colour changed, and 
<A NAME="431"></A>her speech was quite lost. At this sight her women made a loud cry, and 
<A NAME="432"></A>many of the neighbours running to Brutus's door to know what was the matter, 
<A NAME="433"></A>the report was soon spread abroad that Porcia was dead; though with her 
<A NAME="434"></A>women's help she recovered in a little while, and came to herself again. 
<A NAME="435"></A>When Brutus received this news, he was extremely troubled, not without 
<A NAME="436"></A>reason, yet was not so carried away by his private grief as to quit his 
<A NAME="437"></A>public purpose.
<A NAME="438"></A><BR><BR>For now news was brought that Caesar was coming, carried in a litter. 
<A NAME="439"></A>For, being discouraged by the ill-omens that attended his sacrifice, he 
<A NAME="440"></A>had determined to undertake no affairs of any great importance that day, 
<A NAME="441"></A>but to defer them till another time, excusing himself that he was sick. 
<A NAME="442"></A>As soon as he came out of his litter, Popilius Laenas, he who but a little 
<A NAME="443"></A>before had wished Brutus good success in his undertaking, coming up to 
<A NAME="444"></A>him, conversed a great while with him, Caesar standing still all the while, 
<A NAME="445"></A>and seeming to be very attentive. The conspirators (to give them this name), 
<A NAME="446"></A>not being able to hear what he said, but guessing by what themselves were 
<A NAME="447"></A>conscious of that this conference was the discovery of their treason, were 
<A NAME="448"></A>again disheartened, and, looking upon one another, agreed from each other's 
<A NAME="449"></A>countenances that they should not stay to be taken, but should all kill 
<A NAME="450"></A>themselves. And now when Cassius and some others were laying hands upon 
<A NAME="451"></A>their daggers under their robes, and were drawing them out, Brutus, viewing 
<A NAME="452"></A>narrowly the looks and gesture of Laenas, and finding that he was earnestly 
<A NAME="453"></A>petitioning and not accusing, said nothing, because there were many strangers 
<A NAME="454"></A>to the conspiracy mingled amongst them: but by a cheerful countenance encouraged 
<A NAME="455"></A>Cassius. And after a little while, Laenas, having kissed Caesar's hand, 
<A NAME="456"></A>went away, showing plainly that all his discourse was about some particular 
<A NAME="457"></A>business relating to himself.
<A NAME="458"></A><BR><BR>Now when the senate was gone in before to the chamber where they 
<A NAME="459"></A>were to sit, the rest of the company placed themselves close about Caesar's 
<A NAME="460"></A>chair, as if they had some suit to make to him, and Cassius, turning his 
<A NAME="461"></A>face to Pompey's statue, is said to have invoked it, as if it had been 
<A NAME="462"></A>sensible of his prayers. Trebonius, in the meanwhile, engaged Antony's 
<A NAME="463"></A>attention at the door, and kept him in talk outside. When Caesar entered, 
<A NAME="464"></A>the whole senate rose up to him. As soon as he was sat down, the men all 
<A NAME="465"></A>crowded round about him, and set Tillius Cimber, one of their own number, 
<A NAME="466"></A>to intercede in behalf of his brother that was banished; they all joined 
<A NAME="467"></A>their prayers with his, and took Caesar by the hand, and kissed his head 
<A NAME="468"></A>and his breast. But he putting aside at first their supplications, and 
<A NAME="469"></A>afterwards, when he saw they would not desist, violently rising up, Tillius 
<A NAME="470"></A>with both hands caught hold of his robe and pulled it off from his shoulders, 
<A NAME="471"></A>and Casca, that stood behind him, drawing his dagger, gave him the first, 
<A NAME="472"></A>but a slight wound, about the shoulder. Caesar snatching hold of the handle 
<A NAME="473"></A>of the dagger, and crying out aloud in Latin, "Villain Casca, what do you?" 
<A NAME="474"></A>he, calling in Greek to his brother, bade him come and help. And by this 
<A NAME="475"></A>time, finding himself struck by a great many hands, and looking around 
<A NAME="476"></A>about him to see if he could force his way out, when he saw Brutus with 
<A NAME="477"></A>his dagger drawn against him, he let go Casca's hand, that he had hold 
<A NAME="478"></A>of and covering his head with his robe, gave up his body to their blows. 
<A NAME="479"></A>And they so eagerly pressed towards the body, and so many daggers were 
<A NAME="480"></A>hacking together, that they cut one another; Brutus, particularly, received 
<A NAME="481"></A>a wound in his hand, and all of them were besmeared with the 
<A NAME="482"></A>blood.
<A NAME="483"></A><BR><BR>Caesar being thus slain, Brutus, stepping forth into the midst, 
<A NAME="484"></A>intended to have made a speech, and called back and encouraged the senators 
<A NAME="485"></A>to stay; but they all affrighted ran away in great disorder, and there 
<A NAME="486"></A>was a great confusion and press at the door, though none pursued or followed. 
<A NAME="487"></A>For they had come to an express resolution to kill nobody beside Caesar, 
<A NAME="488"></A>but to call and invite all the rest to liberty. It was indeed the opinion 
<A NAME="489"></A>of all the others, when they consulted about the execution of their design, 
<A NAME="490"></A>that it was necessary to cut off Antony with Caesar, looking upon him as 
<A NAME="491"></A>an insolent man, an affecter of monarchy, and one that, by his familiar 
<A NAME="492"></A>intercourse, had gained a powerful interest with the soldiers. And this 
<A NAME="493"></A>they urged the rather, because at that time to the natural loftiness and 
<A NAME="494"></A>ambition of his temper there was added the dignity of being counsel and 
<A NAME="495"></A>colleague to Caesar. But Brutus opposed this consul, insisting first upon 
<A NAME="496"></A>the injustice of it, and afterwards giving them hopes that a change might 
<A NAME="497"></A>be worked in Antony. For he did not despair but that so highly gifted and 
<A NAME="498"></A>honourable a man, and such a lover of glory as Antony, stirred up with 
<A NAME="499"></A>emulation of their great attempt, might, if Caesar were once removed, lay 
<A NAME="500"></A>hold of the occasion to be joint restorer with them of the liberty of his 
<A NAME="501"></A>country. Thus did Brutus save Antony's life. But he, in the general consternation, 
<A NAME="502"></A>put himself into a plebeian habit, and fled. But Brutus and his party marched 
<A NAME="503"></A>up to the capitol, in their way showing their hands all bloody, and their 
<A NAME="504"></A>naked swords, and proclaiming liberty to the people. At first all places 
<A NAME="505"></A>were filled with cries and shouts; and the wild running to and fro, occasioned 
<A NAME="506"></A>by the sudden surprise and passion that every one was in, increased the 
<A NAME="507"></A>tumult in the city. But no other bloodshed following, and no plundering 
<A NAME="508"></A>of the goods in the streets, the senators and many of the people took courage 
<A NAME="509"></A>and went up to the men in the capitol; and a multitude being gathered together, 
<A NAME="510"></A>Brutus made an oration to them, very popular, and proper for the state 
<A NAME="511"></A>that affairs were then in. Therefore, when they applauded his speech, and 
<A NAME="512"></A>cried out to him to come down, they all took confidence and descended into 
<A NAME="513"></A>the forum; the rest promiscuously mingled with one another, but many of 
<A NAME="514"></A>the most eminent persons, attending Brutus, conducted him in the midst 
<A NAME="515"></A>of them with great honour from the capitol, and placed him in the rostra. 
<A NAME="516"></A>At the sight of Brutus, the crowd, though consisting of a confused mixture 
<A NAME="517"></A>and all disposed to make a tumult, were struck with reverence, and expected 
<A NAME="518"></A>what he would say with order and with silence, and, when he began to speak, 
<A NAME="519"></A>heard him with quiet and attention. But that all were not pleased with 
<A NAME="520"></A>this action they plainly showed when, Cinna beginning to speak and accuse 
<A NAME="521"></A>Caesar, they broke out into a sudden rage, and railed at him in such language 
<A NAME="522"></A>that the whole party thought fit again to withdraw to the capitol. And 
<A NAME="523"></A>there Brutus, expecting to be besieged, dismissed the most eminent of those 
<A NAME="524"></A>that had accompanied them thither, not thinking it just that they who were 
<A NAME="525"></A>not partakers of the fact should share in the danger.
<A NAME="526"></A><BR><BR>But the next day, the senate being assembled in the temple of the 
<A NAME="527"></A>Earth, and Antony and Plancus and Cicero having made orations recommending 
<A NAME="528"></A>concord in general and an act of oblivion, it was decreed that the men 
<A NAME="529"></A>should not only be put out of all fear or danger, but that the consuls 
<A NAME="530"></A>should see what honours and dignities were proper to be conferred upon 
<A NAME="531"></A>them. After which done, the senate broke up; and, Antony having sent his 
<A NAME="532"></A>son as an hostage to the capitol, Brutus and his company came down, and 
<A NAME="533"></A>mutual salutes and invitations passed amongst them, the whole of them being 
<A NAME="534"></A>gathered together. Antony invited and entertained Cassius, Lepidus did 
<A NAME="535"></A>the same to Brutus, and the rest were invited and entertained by others, 
<A NAME="536"></A>as each of them had acquaintance or friends. And as soon as it was day, 
<A NAME="537"></A>the senate met again, and voted thanks to Antony for having stifled the 
<A NAME="538"></A>beginning of a civil war; afterwards Brutus and his associates that were 
<A NAME="539"></A>present received encomiums, and had provinces assigned and distributed 
<A NAME="540"></A>among them. Crete was allotted to Brutus, Africa to Cassius, Asia to Trebonius, 
<A NAME="541"></A>Bithynia to Cimber, and to the other Brutus Gaul about the 
<A NAME="542"></A>Po.
<A NAME="543"></A><BR><BR>After these things, they began to consider of Caesar's will, and 
<A NAME="544"></A>the ordering of his funeral. Antony desired that the will might be read, 
<A NAME="545"></A>and that the body should not have a private or dishonourable interment, 
<A NAME="546"></A>lest that should further exasperate the people. This Cassius violently 
<A NAME="547"></A>opposed, but Brutus yielded to it, and gave leave; in which he seems to 
<A NAME="548"></A>have a second time committed a fault. For as before in sparing the life 
<A NAME="549"></A>of Antony he could not be without some blame from his party, as thereby 
<A NAME="550"></A>setting up against the conspiracy a dangerous and difficult enemy, so now, 
<A NAME="551"></A>in suffering him to have the ordering of the funeral, he fell into a total 
<A NAME="552"></A>and irrevocable error. For first, it appearing by the will that Caesar 
<A NAME="553"></A>had bequeathed to the Roman people seventy-five drachmas a man, and given 
<A NAME="554"></A>to the public his gardens beyond Tiber (where now the temple of Fortune 
<A NAME="555"></A>stands), the whole city was fired with a wonderful affection for him, and 
<A NAME="556"></A>a passionate sense of the loss of him. And when the body was brought forth 
<A NAME="557"></A>into the forum, Antony, as the custom was, making a funeral oration in 
<A NAME="558"></A>the praise of Caesar, and finding the multitude moved with his speech, 
<A NAME="559"></A>passing into the pathetic tone, unfolded the bloody garment of Caesar, 
<A NAME="560"></A>showed them in how many places it was pierced, and the number of his wounds. 
<A NAME="561"></A>Now there was nothing to be seen but confusion, some cried out to kill 
<A NAME="562"></A>the murderers, others (as was formerly done when Clodius led the people) 
<A NAME="563"></A>tore away the benches and tables out of the shops round about, and, heaping 
<A NAME="564"></A>them altogether, built a great funeral pile, and having put the body of 
<A NAME="565"></A>Caesar upon it, set it on fire, the spot where this was done being moreover 
<A NAME="566"></A>surrounded with a great many temples and other consecrated places, so that 
<A NAME="567"></A>they seemed to burn the body in a kind of sacred solemnity. As soon as 
<A NAME="568"></A>the fire flamed out, the multitude, flocking in some from one part and 
<A NAME="569"></A>some from another, snatched the brands that were half burnt out of the 
<A NAME="570"></A>pile, and ran about the city to fire the houses of the murderers of Caesar. 
<A NAME="571"></A>But they, having beforehand well fortified themselves, repelled this 
<A NAME="572"></A>danger.
<A NAME="573"></A><BR><BR>There was, however, a kind of poet, one Cinna, not at all concerned 
<A NAME="574"></A>in the guilt of the conspiracy, but on the contrary one of Caesar's friends. 
<A NAME="575"></A>This man dreamed that he was invited to supper by Caesar, and that he declined 
<A NAME="576"></A>to go, but that Caesar entreated and pressed him to it very earnestly; 
<A NAME="577"></A>and at last, taking him by the hand, led him into a very deep and dark 
<A NAME="578"></A>place, whither he was forced against his will to follow in great consternation 
<A NAME="579"></A>and amazement. After this vision, he had a fever the most part of the night; 
<A NAME="580"></A>nevertheless in the morning, hearing that the body of Caesar was to be 
<A NAME="581"></A>carried forth to be interred, he was ashamed not to be present at the solemnity, 
<A NAME="582"></A>and came abroad and joined the people, when they were already infuriated 
<A NAME="583"></A>by the speech of Antony. And perceiving him, and taking him not for that 
<A NAME="584"></A>Cinna who indeed he was, but for him that a little before in a speech to 
<A NAME="585"></A>the people had reproached and inveighed against Caesar, they fell upon 
<A NAME="586"></A>him and tore him to pieces.
<A NAME="587"></A><BR><BR>This action chiefly, and the alteration that Antony had wrought, 
<A NAME="588"></A>so alarmed Brutus and his party that for their safety they retired from 
<A NAME="589"></A>the city. The first stay they made was at Antium, with a design to return 
<A NAME="590"></A>again as soon as the fury of the people had spent itself and was abated, 
<A NAME="591"></A>which they expected would soon and easily come to pass in an unsettled 
<A NAME="592"></A>multitude, apt to be carried away with any sudden and impetuous passion, 
<A NAME="593"></A>especially since they had the senate favourable to them; which, though 
<A NAME="594"></A>it took no notice of those that had torn Cinna to pieces, yet made a strict 
<A NAME="595"></A>search and apprehended in order to punishment those that had assaulted 
<A NAME="596"></A>the houses of the friends of Brutus and Cassius. By this time, also, the 
<A NAME="597"></A>people began to be dissatisfied with Antony, who they perceived was setting 
<A NAME="598"></A>up a kind of monarchy for himself; they longed for the return of Brutus, 
<A NAME="599"></A>whose presence they expected and hoped for at the games and spectacles 
<A NAME="600"></A>which he, as praetor, was to exhibit to the public. But he having intelligence 
<A NAME="601"></A>that many of the old soldiers that had borne arms under Caesar, by whom 
<A NAME="602"></A>they had had lands and cities given them, lay in wait for him, and by small 
<A NAME="603"></A>parties at a time had stolen into the city, would not venture to come himself; 
<A NAME="604"></A>however, in his absence there were most magnificent and costly shows exhibited 
<A NAME="605"></A>to the people; for, having brought up a great number of all sorts of wild 
<A NAME="606"></A>beasts, he gave order that not any of them should be returned or saved, 
<A NAME="607"></A>but that all should be spent freely at the public spectacles. He himself 
<A NAME="608"></A>made a journey to Naples to procure considerable number of players, and 
<A NAME="609"></A>hearing of one Canutius that was very much praised for his acting upon 
<A NAME="610"></A>the stage, he wrote to his friends to use all their entreaties to bring 
<A NAME="611"></A>him to Rome (for, being a Grecian, he could not be compelled); he wrote 
<A NAME="612"></A>also to Cicero, begging him by no means to omit being present at the 
<A NAME="613"></A>shows.
<A NAME="614"></A><BR><BR>This was the posture of affairs when another sudden alteration 
<A NAME="615"></A>was made upon the young Caesar's coming to Rome. He was son to the niece 
<A NAME="616"></A>of Caesar, who adopted him, and left him his heir by his will. At the time 
<A NAME="617"></A>when Caesar was killed, he was following his studies at Apollonia, where 
<A NAME="618"></A>he was expecting also to meet Caesar on his way to the expedition which 
<A NAME="619"></A>he had determined on against the Parthians; but, hearing of his death, 
<A NAME="620"></A>he immediately came to Rome, and to ingratiate himself with the people, 
<A NAME="621"></A>taking upon himself the name of Caesar, and punctually distributing among 
<A NAME="622"></A>the citizens the money that was left them by the will, he soon got the 
<A NAME="623"></A>better of Antony; and by money and largesses, which he liberally dispersed 
<A NAME="624"></A>amongst the soldiers, he gathered together and brought over to his party 
<A NAME="625"></A>a great number of those that had served under Caesar. Cicero himself, out 
<A NAME="626"></A>of the hatred which he bore to Antony, sided with young Caesar; which Brutus 
<A NAME="627"></A>took so ill that he treated with him very sharply in his letters, telling 
<A NAME="628"></A>him that he perceived Cicero could well enough endure a tyrant, but was 
<A NAME="629"></A>afraid that he who hated him should be the man; that in writing and speaking 
<A NAME="630"></A>so well of Caesar, he showed that his aim was to have an easy slavery. 
<A NAME="631"></A>"But our forefathers," said Brutus, "could not brook even gentle masters." 
<A NAME="632"></A>Further he added, that for his own part he had not as yet fully resolved 
<A NAME="633"></A>whether he should make war or peace; but that as to one point he was fixed 
<A NAME="634"></A>and settled, which was, never to be a slave; that he wondered Cicero should 
<A NAME="635"></A>fear the dangers of a civil war, and not be much more afraid of a dishonourable 
<A NAME="636"></A>and infamous peace; that the very reward that was to be given him for subverting 
<A NAME="637"></A>Antony's tyranny was the privilege of establishing Caesar as tyrant in 
<A NAME="638"></A>his place. This is the tone of Brutus's first letters to 
<A NAME="639"></A>Cicero.
<A NAME="640"></A><BR><BR>The city being now divided into two factions, some betaking themselves 
<A NAME="641"></A>to Caesar and others to Antony, the soldiers selling themselves, as it 
<A NAME="642"></A>were, by public outcry, and going over to him that would give them most, 
<A NAME="643"></A>Brutus began to despair of any good event of such proceedings, and, resolving 
<A NAME="644"></A>to leave Italy, passed by land through Lucania and came to Elea by the 
<A NAME="645"></A>seaside. From hence it was thought convenient that Porcia should return 
<A NAME="646"></A>to Rome. She was overcome with grief to part from Brutus, but strove as 
<A NAME="647"></A>much as was possible to conceal it; but, in spite of all her constancy, 
<A NAME="648"></A>a picture which she found there accidentally betrayed it. It was a Greek 
<A NAME="649"></A>subject, Hector parting from Andromache when he went to engage the Greeks, 
<A NAME="650"></A>giving his young son Astyanax into her arms, and she fixing her eyes upon 
<A NAME="651"></A>him. When she looked at this piece, the resemblance it bore to her own 
<A NAME="652"></A>condition made her burst into tears, and several times a day she went to 
<A NAME="653"></A>see the picture, and wept before it. Upon this occasion, when Acilius, 
<A NAME="654"></A>one of Brutus's friends, repeated out of Homer the verses, where Andromache 
<A NAME="655"></A>speaks to Hector:-
<A NAME="656"></A><BR><BR>"But Hector, you
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>To me are father and are mother too,
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>My brother, and my loving husband true." Brutus, smiling, replied, 
<A NAME="659"></A>"But I must not answer Porcia, as Hector did Andromache:-
<A NAME="660"></A><BR><BR>"Mind you your loom, and to your maids give law." "For though the 
<A NAME="661"></A>natural weakness of her body hinders her from doing what only the strength 
<A NAME="662"></A>of men can perform, yet she has a mind as valiant and as active for the 
<A NAME="663"></A>good of her country as the best of us." This narrative is in the memoirs 
<A NAME="664"></A>of Brutus written by Bibulus, Porcia's son.
<A NAME="665"></A><BR><BR>Brutus took ship from hence, and sailed to Athens, where he was 
<A NAME="666"></A>received by the people with great demonstrations of kindness, expressed 
<A NAME="667"></A>in their acclamation and the honours that were decreed him. He lived there 
<A NAME="668"></A>with a private friend, and was a constant auditor of Theomnestus, the Academic, 
<A NAME="669"></A>and Cratippus, the Peripatetic, with whom he so engaged in philosophical 
<A NAME="670"></A>pursuits that he seemed to have laid aside all thoughts of public business, 
<A NAME="671"></A>and to be wholly at leisure for study. But all this while, being unsuspected, 
<A NAME="672"></A>he was secretly making preparations for war; in order to which he sent 
<A NAME="673"></A>Herostratus into Macedonia to secure the commanders there to his side, 
<A NAME="674"></A>and he himself won over and kept at his disposal all the young Romans that 
<A NAME="675"></A>were then students at Athens. Of this number was Cicero's son whom he everywhere 
<A NAME="676"></A>highly extols, and says that whether sleeping or waking he could not choose 
<A NAME="677"></A>but admire a young man of so great a spirit and such a hater of 
<A NAME="678"></A>tyranny.
<A NAME="679"></A><BR><BR>At length he began to act openly, and to appear in public business, 
<A NAME="680"></A>and, being informed that there were several Roman ships full of treasure 
<A NAME="681"></A>that in their course from Asia were to come that way, and that they were 
<A NAME="682"></A>commanded by one of his friends, he went to meet him about Carystus. Finding 
<A NAME="683"></A>him there, and having persuaded him to deliver lip the ships, he made a 
<A NAME="684"></A>more than usually splendid entertainment, for it happened also to be his 
<A NAME="685"></A>birthday. Now when they came to drink, and were filling their cups with 
<A NAME="686"></A>hopes for victory to Brutus and liberty to Rome, Brutus, to animate them 
<A NAME="687"></A>the more, called for a larger bowl, and holding it in his hand, on a sudden, 
<A NAME="688"></A>upon no occasion or forethought, pronounced aloud this 
<A NAME="689"></A>verse:-
<A NAME="690"></A><BR><BR>"But fate my death and Leto's son have wrought." And some writers 
<A NAME="691"></A>add that in the last battle which he fought at Philippi, the word that 
<A NAME="692"></A>he gave to his soldiers was Apollo, and from thence conclude that this 
<A NAME="693"></A>sudden unaccountable exclamation of his was a presage of the overthrow 
<A NAME="694"></A>that he suffered there.
<A NAME="695"></A><BR><BR>Antistius, the commander of these ships, at his parting, gave him 
<A NAME="696"></A>fifty thousand myriads of the money that he was conveying to Italy; and 
<A NAME="697"></A>all the soldiers yet remaining of Pompey's army, who after their general's 
<A NAME="698"></A>defeat wandered about Thessaly, readily and joyfully flocked together to 
<A NAME="699"></A>join him. Besides this, he took from Cinna five hundred horse that he was 
<A NAME="700"></A>carrying to Dolabella into Asia. After that, he sailed to Demetrias, and 
<A NAME="701"></A>there seized a great quantity of arms that had been provided by the command 
<A NAME="702"></A>of the deceased Caesar for the Parthian war, and were now to be sent to 
<A NAME="703"></A>Antony. Then Macedonia was put into his hands and delivered up by Hortensius 
<A NAME="704"></A>the praetor, and all the kings and potentates round about came and offered 
<A NAME="705"></A>their services. So when news was brought that Caius, the brother of Antony, 
<A NAME="706"></A>having passed over from Italy, was marching on directly to join the forces 
<A NAME="707"></A>that Vatinius commanded in Dyrrhachium and Apollonia, Brutus resolved to 
<A NAME="708"></A>anticipate him, and to seize them first, and in all haste moved forwards 
<A NAME="709"></A>with those that he had about him. His march was very difficult, through 
<A NAME="710"></A>rugged places and in a great snow, but so swift that he left those that 
<A NAME="711"></A>were to bring his provisions for the morning meal a great way behind. And 
<A NAME="712"></A>now, being very near to Dyrrhachium, with fatigue and cold he fell into 
<A NAME="713"></A>the distemper called Bulimia. This is a disease that seizes both men and 
<A NAME="714"></A>cattle after much labour, and especially in a great snow; whether it is 
<A NAME="715"></A>caused by the natural heat when the body is seized with cold, being forced 
<A NAME="716"></A>all inwards, and consuming at once all the nourishment laid in, or whether 
<A NAME="717"></A>the sharp and subtle vapour which comes from the snow as it dissolves cuts 
<A NAME="718"></A>the body, as it were, and destroys the heat which issues through the pores; 
<A NAME="719"></A>for the sweatings seem to arise from the heat meeting with the cold, and 
<A NAME="720"></A>being quenched by it on the surface of the body. But this I have in another 
<A NAME="721"></A>place discussed more at large.
<A NAME="722"></A><BR><BR>Brutus growing very faint, and there being none in the whole army 
<A NAME="723"></A>that had anything for him to eat, his servants were forced to have recourse 
<A NAME="724"></A>to the enemy, and, going as far as to the gates of the city, begged bread 
<A NAME="725"></A>of the sentinels that were upon duty. As soon as they heard of the condition 
<A NAME="726"></A>of Brutus, they came themselves, and brought both meat and drink along 
<A NAME="727"></A>with them; in return for which Brutus, when he took the city, showed the 
<A NAME="728"></A>greatest kindness, not to them only, but to all the inhabitants, for their 
<A NAME="729"></A>sakes. Caius Antonius, in the meantime, coming to Apollonia, summoned all 
<A NAME="730"></A>the soldiers that were near that city to join him there; but finding that 
<A NAME="731"></A>they nevertheless went all to Brutus, and suspecting that even those of 
<A NAME="732"></A>Apollonia were inclined to the same party, he quitted that city, and came 
<A NAME="733"></A>to Buthrotum, having first lost three cohorts of his men, that in their 
<A NAME="734"></A>march thither were cut to pieces by Brutus. After this, attempting to make 
<A NAME="735"></A>himself master of some strong places about Byllis which the enemy had first 
<A NAME="736"></A>seized, he was overcome in a set battle by young Cicero, to whom Brutus 
<A NAME="737"></A>gave the command, and whose conduct he made use of often and with much 
<A NAME="738"></A>success. Caius himself was surprised in a marshy place, at a distance from 
<A NAME="739"></A>his support; and Brutus having him in his power would not suffer his soldiers 
<A NAME="740"></A>to attack, but maneuvering about the enemy with his horse, gave command 
<A NAME="741"></A>that none of them should be killed, for that in a little time they would 
<A NAME="742"></A>all be of his side; which accordingly came to pass, for they surrendered 
<A NAME="743"></A>both themselves and their general. So that Brutus had by this time a very 
<A NAME="744"></A>great and considerable army. He showed all marks of honour and esteem to 
<A NAME="745"></A>Caius for a long time, and left him the use of the ensigns of his office, 
<A NAME="746"></A>though, as some report, he had several letters from Rome, and particularly 
<A NAME="747"></A>from Cicero, advising him to put him to death. But at last, perceiving 
<A NAME="748"></A>that he began to corrupt his officers, and was trying to raise a mutiny 
<A NAME="749"></A>amongst the soldiers, he put him aboard a ship and kept him close prisoner. 
<A NAME="750"></A>In the meantime, the soldiers that had been corrupted by Caius retired 
<A NAME="751"></A>to Apollonia, and sent word to Brutus, desiring him to come to them thither. 
<A NAME="752"></A>He answered that this was not the custom of the Romans, but that it became 
<A NAME="753"></A>those who had offended to come themselves to their general and beg forgiveness 
<A NAME="754"></A>of their offences; which they did, and accordingly received their 
<A NAME="755"></A>pardon.
<A NAME="756"></A><BR><BR>As he was preparing to pass into Asia, tidings reached him of the 
<A NAME="757"></A>alteration that had happened at Rome; where the young Caesar, assisted 
<A NAME="758"></A>by the senate, in opposition to Antony, and having driven his competitor 
<A NAME="759"></A>out of Italy, had begun himself to be very formidable, suing for the consulship 
<A NAME="760"></A>contrary to law, and maintaining large bodies of troops of which the commonwealth 
<A NAME="761"></A>had no manner of need. And then, perceiving that the senate, dissatisfied 
<A NAME="762"></A>with the proceedings, began to cast their eyes abroad upon Brutus, and 
<A NAME="763"></A>decreed and confirmed the government of several provinces to him, he had 
<A NAME="764"></A>taken the alarm. Therefore despatching messengers to Antony, he desired 
<A NAME="765"></A>that there might be a reconciliation, and a friendship between them. Then, 
<A NAME="766"></A>drawing all his forces about the city, he made himself to be chosen consul, 
<A NAME="767"></A>though he was but a boy, being scarce twenty years old, as he himself writes 
<A NAME="768"></A>in his memoirs. At the first entry upon the consulship he immediately ordered 
<A NAME="769"></A>a judicial process to be issued out against Brutus and his accomplices 
<A NAME="770"></A>for having murdered a principal man of the city, holding the highest magistracies 
<A NAME="771"></A>of Rome, without being heard or condemned; and appointed Lucius Cornificus 
<A NAME="772"></A>to accuse Brutus, and Marcus Agrippa to accuse Cassius. None appearing 
<A NAME="773"></A>to the accusation, the judges were forced to pass sentence and condemn 
<A NAME="774"></A>them both. It is reported that when the crier from the tribunal, as the 
<A NAME="775"></A>custom was, with a loud voice cried Brutus to appear, the people groaned 
<A NAME="776"></A>audibly, and the noble citizens hung down their heads for grief. Publicus 
<A NAME="777"></A>Silicius was seen to burst out into tears, which was the cause that not 
<A NAME="778"></A>long after he was put down in the list of those that were proscribed. After 
<A NAME="779"></A>this, the three men, Caesar, Antony, and Lepidus, being perfectly reconciled, 
<A NAME="780"></A>shared the provinces among themselves, and made up the catalogue of proscription, 
<A NAME="781"></A>wherein were set those that were designed for slaughter, amounting to two 
<A NAME="782"></A>hundred men, in which number Cicero was slain.
<A NAME="783"></A><BR><BR>The news being brought to Brutus in Macedonia, he was under a compulsion, 
<A NAME="784"></A>and sent orders to Hortensius that he should kill Caius Antonius in revenge 
<A NAME="785"></A>of the death of Cicero his friend, and Brutus his kinsman, who also was 
<A NAME="786"></A>proscribed and slain. Upon this account it was that Antony, having afterwards 
<A NAME="787"></A>taken Hortensius in the battle of Philippi, slew him upon his brother's 
<A NAME="788"></A>tomb. But Brutus expresses himself as more ashamed for the cause of Cicero's 
<A NAME="789"></A>death than grieved for the misfortune of it, and says he cannot help accusing 
<A NAME="790"></A>his friends at Rome, that they were slaves more through their own doing 
<A NAME="791"></A>than that of those who now were their tyrants; they could be present and 
<A NAME="792"></A>see and yet suffer those things which even to hear related ought to them 
<A NAME="793"></A>to have been insufferable.
<A NAME="794"></A><BR><BR>Having made his army, that was already very considerable, pass 
<A NAME="795"></A>into Asia, he ordered a fleet to be prepared in Bithynia and about Cyzicus. 
<A NAME="796"></A>But going himself through the country by land, he made it his business 
<A NAME="797"></A>to settle and confirm all the cities, and gave audience to the princes 
<A NAME="798"></A>of the parts through which he passed. And he sent orders into Syria to 
<A NAME="799"></A>Cassius to come to him, and leave his intended journey into Egypt; letting 
<A NAME="800"></A>him understand that it was not to gain an empire for themselves, but to 
<A NAME="801"></A>free their country, that they went thus wandering about and had got an 
<A NAME="802"></A>army together whose business it was to destroy the tyrants; that therefore, 
<A NAME="803"></A>if they remembered and resolved to persevere in their first purpose, they 
<A NAME="804"></A>ought not to be too far from Italy, but make what haste they could thither, 
<A NAME="805"></A>and endeavour to relieve their fellow-citizens from 
<A NAME="806"></A>oppression.
<A NAME="807"></A><BR><BR>Cassius obeyed his summons, and returned, and Brutus went to meet 
<A NAME="808"></A>him; and at Smyrna they met, which was the first time they had seen one 
<A NAME="809"></A>another since they parted at the Piraeus in Athens, one for Syria, and 
<A NAME="810"></A>the other for Macedonia. They were both extremely joyful and had great 
<A NAME="811"></A>confidence of their success at the sight of the forces that each of them 
<A NAME="812"></A>had got together, since they who had fled from Italy, like the most despicable 
<A NAME="813"></A>exiles, without money, without arms, without a ship or a soldier or a city 
<A NAME="814"></A>to rely on, in a little time after had met together so well furnished with 
<A NAME="815"></A>shipping and money, and an army both of horse and foot, that they were 
<A NAME="816"></A>in a condition to contend for the empire of Rome.
<A NAME="817"></A><BR><BR>Cassius was desirous to show no less respect and honour to Brutus 
<A NAME="818"></A>than Brutus did to him; but Brutus was still beforehand with him, coming 
<A NAME="819"></A>for the most part to him, both because he was the elder man, and of a weaker 
<A NAME="820"></A>constitution than himself. Men generally reckoned Cassius a very expert 
<A NAME="821"></A>soldier, but of a harsh and angry nature, and one that desired to command 
<A NAME="822"></A>rather by fear than love, though, on the other side, among his familiar 
<A NAME="823"></A>acquaintance he would easily give way to jesting and play the buffoon. 
<A NAME="824"></A>But Brutus, for his virtue, was esteemed by the people, beloved by his 
<A NAME="825"></A>friends, admired by the best men, and hated not by his enemies themselves. 
<A NAME="826"></A>For he was a man of a singularly gentle nature, of a great spirit, insensible 
<A NAME="827"></A>of the passions of anger or pleasure or covetousness; steady and inflexible 
<A NAME="828"></A>to maintain his purpose for what he thought right and honest. And that 
<A NAME="829"></A>which gained him the greatest affection and reputation was the entire faith 
<A NAME="830"></A>in his intentions. For it had not ever been supposed that Pompey the Great 
<A NAME="831"></A>himself, if he had overcome Caesar, would have submitted his power to the 
<A NAME="832"></A>laws, instead of taking the management of the state upon himself, soothing 
<A NAME="833"></A>the people with the specious name of consul or dictator, or some other 
<A NAME="834"></A>milder title than king. And they were well persuaded that Cassius, being 
<A NAME="835"></A>a man governed by anger and passion, and carried often, for his interest's 
<A NAME="836"></A>sake, beyond the bounds of justice, endured all these hardships of war 
<A NAME="837"></A>and travel and danger most assuredly to obtain dominion to himself, and 
<A NAME="838"></A>not liberty to the people. And as for the former disturbers of the peace 
<A NAME="839"></A>of Rome, whether a Cinna, a Marius, or a Carbo, it is manifest that they, 
<A NAME="840"></A>having set their country as a stake for him that should win, did almost 
<A NAME="841"></A>own in express terms that they fought for empire. But even the enemies 
<A NAME="842"></A>of Brutus did not, they tell us, lay this accusation to his charge; nay, 
<A NAME="843"></A>many heard Antony himself say that Brutus was the only man that conspired 
<A NAME="844"></A>against Caesar out of a sense of the glory and the apparent justice of 
<A NAME="845"></A>the action, but that all the rest rose up against the man himself, from 
<A NAME="846"></A>private envy and malice of their own. And it is plain by what he writes 
<A NAME="847"></A>himself, that Brutus did not so much rely upon his forces, as upon his 
<A NAME="848"></A>own virtue. For thus he speaks in a letter to Atticus, shortly before he 
<A NAME="849"></A>was to engage with the enemy: that his affairs were in the best state of 
<A NAME="850"></A>fortune that he could wish; for that either he should overcome, and restore 
<A NAME="851"></A>liberty to the people of Rome, or die, and be himself out of the reach 
<A NAME="852"></A>of slavery; that other things being certain and beyond all hazard, one 
<A NAME="853"></A>thing was yet in doubt, whether they should live or die free men. He adds 
<A NAME="854"></A>further, that Mark Antony had received a just punishment for his folly, 
<A NAME="855"></A>who, when he might have been numbered with Brutus and Cassius and Cato, 
<A NAME="856"></A>would join himself to Octavius; that though they should not now be both 
<A NAME="857"></A>overcome, they soon would fight between themselves. And in this he seems 
<A NAME="858"></A>to have been no ill-prophet.
<A NAME="859"></A><BR><BR>Now when they were at Smyrna, Brutus desired of Cassius that he 
<A NAME="860"></A>might have part of the great treasure that he had heaped up, because all 
<A NAME="861"></A>his own was expended in furnishing out such a fleet of ships as was sufficient 
<A NAME="862"></A>to keep the whole interior sea in their power. But Cassius's friends dissuaded 
<A NAME="863"></A>him from this; "for," said they, "it is not just that the money which you 
<A NAME="864"></A>with so much parsimony keep, and with so much envy have got, should be 
<A NAME="865"></A>given to him to be disposed of in making himself popular, and gaining the 
<A NAME="866"></A>favour of the soldiers." Notwithstanding this, Cassius gave him a third 
<A NAME="867"></A>part of all that he had; and then they parted each to their several commands. 
<A NAME="868"></A>Cassius, having taken Rhodes, behaved himself there with no clemency; though 
<A NAME="869"></A>at his first entry, when some had called him lord and king, he answered 
<A NAME="870"></A>that he was neither king nor lord, but the destroyer and punisher of a 
<A NAME="871"></A>king and lord. Brutus, on the other part, sent to the Lycians to demand 
<A NAME="872"></A>from them a supply of money and men, but Laucrates, their popular leader, 
<A NAME="873"></A>persuaded the cities to resist, and they occupied several little mountains 
<A NAME="874"></A>and hills with a design to hinder Brutus's passage. Brutus at first sent 
<A NAME="875"></A>out a party of horse which, surprising them as they were eating, killed 
<A NAME="876"></A>six hundred of them, and afterward, having taken all their small towns 
<A NAME="877"></A>and villages round about, he set all his prisoners free without ransom, 
<A NAME="878"></A>hoping to win the whole nation by good-will. But they continued obstinate, 
<A NAME="879"></A>taking in anger what they had suffered, and despising his goodness and 
<A NAME="880"></A>humanity; until, having forced the most warlike of them into the city of 
<A NAME="881"></A>Xanthus, he besieged them there. They endeavoured to make their escape 
<A NAME="882"></A>by swimming and diving through the river that flows by the town, but were 
<A NAME="883"></A>taken by nets let down for that purpose in the channel, which had little 
<A NAME="884"></A>bells at the top, which gave present notice of any that were taken in them. 
<A NAME="885"></A>After that, they made a sally in the night, and seizing several of the 
<A NAME="886"></A>battering engines, set them on fire; but being perceived by the Romans, 
<A NAME="887"></A>were beaten back to their walls, and there being a strong wind, it carried 
<A NAME="888"></A>the flames to the battlements of the city with such fierceness that several 
<A NAME="889"></A>of the adjoining houses took fire. Brutus, fearing lest the whole city 
<A NAME="890"></A>should be destroyed, commanded his own soldiers to assist and quench the 
<A NAME="891"></A>fire.
<A NAME="892"></A><BR><BR>But the Lycians were on a sudden possessed with a strange and incredible 
<A NAME="893"></A>desperation; such a frenzy as cannot be better expressed than by calling 
<A NAME="894"></A>it a violent appetite to die, for both women and children, the bondmen 
<A NAME="895"></A>and the free, those of all ages and of all conditions strove to force away 
<A NAME="896"></A>the soldiers that came in to their assistance from the walls; and themselves 
<A NAME="897"></A>gathering together reeds and wood, and whatever combustible matter they 
<A NAME="898"></A>found, spread the fire over the whole city, feeding it with whatever fuel 
<A NAME="899"></A>they could, and by all possible means exciting its fury, so that the flame, 
<A NAME="900"></A>having dispersed itself and encircled the whole city, blazed out in so 
<A NAME="901"></A>terrible a manner that Brutus, extremely afflicted at their calamity, got 
<A NAME="902"></A>on horseback and rode round the walls, earnestly desirous to preserve the 
<A NAME="903"></A>city, and stretching forth his hands to the Xanthians, begged of them that 
<A NAME="904"></A>they would spare themselves and save the town. Yet none regarded his entreaties, 
<A NAME="905"></A>but, by all manner of ways, strove to destroy themselves; not only men 
<A NAME="906"></A>and women, but even boys and little children, with a hideous outcry, leaped 
<A NAME="907"></A>some into the fire, others from the walls, others fell upon their parents' 
<A NAME="908"></A>swords, baring their throats and desiring to be struck. After the destruction 
<A NAME="909"></A>of the city, there was found a woman who had hanged herself with her young 
<A NAME="910"></A>child hanging from her neck, and the torch in her hand with which she had 
<A NAME="911"></A>fired her own house.
<A NAME="912"></A><BR><BR>It was so tragical a sight that Brutus could not endure to see 
<A NAME="913"></A>it, but wept at the very relation of it and proclaimed a reward to any 
<A NAME="914"></A>soldier that could save a Xanthian. And it is said that an hundred and 
<A NAME="915"></A>fifty only were found, to have their lives saved against their wills. Thus 
<A NAME="916"></A>the Xanthians after a long space of years, the fated period of their destruction 
<A NAME="917"></A>having, as it were, run its course, repeated by their desperate deed the 
<A NAME="918"></A>former calamity of their forefathers, who after the very same manner in 
<A NAME="919"></A>the Persian war had fired their city and destroyed themselves.
<A NAME="920"></A><BR><BR>Brutus, after this, finding the Patareans resolved to make resistance 
<A NAME="921"></A>and hold out their city against him, was very unwilling to besiege it, 
<A NAME="922"></A>and was in great perplexity lest the same frenzy might seize them too. 
<A NAME="923"></A>But having in his power some of their women, who were his prisoners, he 
<A NAME="924"></A>dismissed them all without any ransom; who, returning and giving an account 
<A NAME="925"></A>to their husbands and fathers, who were of the greatest rank, what an excellent 
<A NAME="926"></A>man Brutus was, how temperate and how just, persuaded them to yield themselves 
<A NAME="927"></A>and put their city into his hands. From this time all the cities round 
<A NAME="928"></A>about came into his power, submitting themselves to him, and found him 
<A NAME="929"></A>good and merciful even beyond their hopes. For though Cassius at the same 
<A NAME="930"></A>time had compelled the Rhodians to bring in all the silver and gold that 
<A NAME="931"></A>each of them privately was possessed of, by which he raised a sum of eight 
<A NAME="932"></A>thousand talents, and besides this had condemned the public to pay the 
<A NAME="933"></A>sum of five hundred talents more, Brutus, not having taken above a hundred 
<A NAME="934"></A>and fifty talents from the Lycians, and having done them no other manner 
<A NAME="935"></A>of injury, parted from thence with his army to go into 
<A NAME="936"></A>Ionia.
<A NAME="937"></A><BR><BR>Through the whole course of this expedition, Brutus did many memorable 
<A NAME="938"></A>acts of justice in dispensing rewards and punishments to such as had deserved 
<A NAME="939"></A>either; but one in particular I will relate, because he himself, and all 
<A NAME="940"></A>the noblest Romans, were gratified with it above all the rest. When Pompey 
<A NAME="941"></A>the Great, being overthrown from his great power by Caesar, had fled to 
<A NAME="942"></A>Egypt, and landed near Pelusium, the protectors of the young king consulted 
<A NAME="943"></A>among themselves what was fit to be done on that occasion, nor could they 
<A NAME="944"></A>all agree in the same opinion, some being for receiving him, others for 
<A NAME="945"></A>driving him from Egypt. But Theodotus, a Chian by birth, and then attending 
<A NAME="946"></A>upon the king as a paid teacher of rhetoric, and for want of better men 
<A NAME="947"></A>admitted into the council, undertook to prove to them that both parties 
<A NAME="948"></A>were in the wrong, those that counselled to receive Pompey, and those that 
<A NAME="949"></A>advised to send him away; that in their present case one thing only was 
<A NAME="950"></A>truly expedient, to seize him and to kill him; and ended his argument with 
<A NAME="951"></A>the proverb, that "dead men don't bite." The council agreed to his opinion, 
<A NAME="952"></A>and Pompey the Great (an example of incredible and unforeseen events) was 
<A NAME="953"></A>slain, as the sophister himself had the impudence to boast, through the 
<A NAME="954"></A>rhetoric and cleverness of Theodotus. Not long after, when Caesar came 
<A NAME="955"></A>to Egypt, some of the murderers received their just reward and suffered 
<A NAME="956"></A>the evil death they deserved. But Theodotus, though he had borrowed on 
<A NAME="957"></A>from fortune a little further time for a poor, despicable, and wandering 
<A NAME="958"></A>life, yet did not lie hid from Brutus as he passed through Asia; but being 
<A NAME="959"></A>seized by him and executed, had his death made more memorable than was 
<A NAME="960"></A>his life.
<A NAME="961"></A><BR><BR>About this time, Brutus sent to Cassius to come to him at the city 
<A NAME="962"></A>of Sardis, and, when he was on his journey, went forth with his friends 
<A NAME="963"></A>to meet him; and the whole army in array saluted each of them with the 
<A NAME="964"></A>name of Imperator. Now (as it usually happens in business of great concern, 
<A NAME="965"></A>and where many friends and many commanders are engaged), several jealousies 
<A NAME="966"></A>of each other and matters of private accusation having passed between Brutus 
<A NAME="967"></A>and Cassius, they resolved, before they entered upon any other business, 
<A NAME="968"></A>immediately to withdraw into some apartment; where, the door being shut 
<A NAME="969"></A>and they two alone, they began first to expostulate, then to dispute hotly, 
<A NAME="970"></A>and accuse each other; and finally were so transported into passion as 
<A NAME="971"></A>to fall to hard words, and at last burst out into tears. Their friends 
<A NAME="972"></A>who stood without were amazed, hearing them loud and angry, and feared 
<A NAME="973"></A>lest some mischief might follow, but yet durst not interrupt them, being 
<A NAME="974"></A>commanded not to enter the room. However, Marcus Favonius, who had been 
<A NAME="975"></A>an ardent admirer of Cato, and, not so much by his learning or wisdom as 
<A NAME="976"></A>by his wild, vehement manner, maintained the character of a philosopher, 
<A NAME="977"></A>was rushing in upon them, but was hindered by the attendants. But it was 
<A NAME="978"></A>a hard matter to stop Favonius, wherever his wildness hurried him; for 
<A NAME="979"></A>he was fierce in all his behaviour, and ready to do anything to get his 
<A NAME="980"></A>will. And though he was a senator, yet, thinking that one of the least 
<A NAME="981"></A>of his excellences, he valued himself more upon a sort of cynical liberty 
<A NAME="982"></A>of speaking what he pleased, which sometimes, indeed, did away with the 
<A NAME="983"></A>rudeness and unseasonableness of his addresses with those that would interpret 
<A NAME="984"></A>it in jest. This Favonius, breaking by force through those that kept the 
<A NAME="985"></A>doors, entered into the chamber, and with a set voice declaimed the verses 
<A NAME="986"></A>that Homer makes Nestor use-
<A NAME="987"></A><BR><BR>"Be ruled, for I am older than ye both." At this Cassius laughed; 
<A NAME="988"></A>but Brutus thrust him out, calling him impudent dog and counterfeit Cynic; 
<A NAME="989"></A>but yet for the present they let it put an end to their dispute, and parted. 
<A NAME="990"></A>Cassius made a supper that night, and Brutus invited the guests; and when 
<A NAME="991"></A>they were set down, Favonius, having bathed, came in among them. Brutus 
<A NAME="992"></A>called out aloud and told him he was not invited, and bade him go to the 
<A NAME="993"></A>upper couch; but he violently thrust himself in, and lay down on the middle 
<A NAME="994"></A>one; and the entertainment passed in sportive talk, not wanting either 
<A NAME="995"></A>wit or philosophy.
<A NAME="996"></A><BR><BR>The next day after, upon the accusation of the Sardians, Brutus 
<A NAME="997"></A>publicly disgraced and condemned Lucius Pella, one that had been censor 
<A NAME="998"></A>of Rome, and employed in offices of trust by himself, for having embezzled 
<A NAME="999"></A>the public money. This action did not a little vex Cassius; for but a few 
<A NAME="1000"></A>days before, two of his own friends being accused of the same crime, he 
<A NAME="1001"></A>only admonished them in private, but in public absolved them, and continued 
<A NAME="1002"></A>them in his service; and upon this occasion he accused Brutus of too much 
<A NAME="1003"></A>rigour and severity of justice in a time which required them to use more 
<A NAME="1004"></A>policy and favour. But Brutus bade him remember the Ides of March, the 
<A NAME="1005"></A>day when they killed Caesar, who himself neither plundered nor pillaged 
<A NAME="1006"></A>mankind, but was only the support and strength of those that did; and bade 
<A NAME="1007"></A>him consider that if there was any colour for justice to be neglected, 
<A NAME="1008"></A>it had been better to suffer the injustice of Caesar's friends than to 
<A NAME="1009"></A>give impunity to their own; "for then," said he, "we would have been accused 
<A NAME="1010"></A>of cowardice only; whereas now we are liable to the accusation of injustice, 
<A NAME="1011"></A>after all our pain and dangers which we endure." By which we may perceive 
<A NAME="1012"></A>what was Brutus's purpose, and the rule of his actions.
<A NAME="1013"></A><BR><BR>About the time that they were going to pass out of Asia into Europe, 
<A NAME="1014"></A>it is said that a wonderful sign was seen by Brutus. He was naturally given 
<A NAME="1015"></A>to much watching, and by practice and moderation in his diet had reduced 
<A NAME="1016"></A>his allowance of sleep to a very small amount of time. He never slept in 
<A NAME="1017"></A>the daytime, and in the night then only when all his business was finished, 
<A NAME="1018"></A>and when, every one else being gone to rest, he had nobody to discourse 
<A NAME="1019"></A>with him. But at this time, the war being begun, having the whole state 
<A NAME="1020"></A>of it to consider, and being solicitous of the event, after his first sleep, 
<A NAME="1021"></A>which he let himself take after his supper, he spent all the rest of the 
<A NAME="1022"></A>night in settling his most urgent affairs; which if he could despatch early 
<A NAME="1023"></A>and so make a saving of any leisure, he employed himself in reading until 
<A NAME="1024"></A>the third watch, at which time the centurions and tribunes were used to 
<A NAME="1025"></A>come to him for orders. Thus one night before he passed out of Asia, he 
<A NAME="1026"></A>was very late all alone in his tent, with a dim light burning by him, all 
<A NAME="1027"></A>the rest of the camp being bushed and silent; and reasoning about something 
<A NAME="1028"></A>with himself and very thoughtful, he fancied some one came in, and, looking 
<A NAME="1029"></A>up towards the door, he saw a terrible and strange appearance of an unnatural 
<A NAME="1030"></A>and frightful body standing by him without speaking. Brutus boldly asked 
<A NAME="1031"></A>it, "What are you, of men or gods, and upon what business come to me?" 
<A NAME="1032"></A>The figure answered "I am your evil genius, Brutus; you shall see me at 
<A NAME="1033"></A>Philippi." To which Brutus, not at all disturbed, replied, "Then I shall 
<A NAME="1034"></A>see you."
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR><BR>As soon as the apparition vanished, he called his servants to him, 
<A NAME="1036"></A>who all told him that they had neither heard any voice nor seen any vision. 
<A NAME="1037"></A>So then he continued watching till the morning, when he went to Cassius, 
<A NAME="1038"></A>and told him of what he had seen. He, who followed the principles of Epicurus's 
<A NAME="1039"></A>philosophy, and often used to dispute with Brutus concerning matters of 
<A NAME="1040"></A>this nature, spoke to him thus upon this occasion: "It is the opinion of 
<A NAME="1041"></A>our sect, Brutus, that not all that we feel or see is real and true; but 
<A NAME="1042"></A>that the sense is a most slippery and deceitful thing, and the mind yet 
<A NAME="1043"></A>more quick and subtle to put the sense in motion and affect it with every 
<A NAME="1044"></A>kind of change upon no real occasion of fact; just as an impression is 
<A NAME="1045"></A>made upon wax; and the soul of man, which has in itself both what imprints, 
<A NAME="1046"></A>and what is imprinted on, may most easily, by its own operations, produce 
<A NAME="1047"></A>and assume every variety of shape and figure. This is evident from the 
<A NAME="1048"></A>sudden changes of our dreams; in which the imaginative principle, once 
<A NAME="1049"></A>started by any trifling matter, goes through a whole series of most diverse 
<A NAME="1050"></A>emotions and appearances. It is its nature to be ever in motion, and its 
<A NAME="1051"></A>motion is fantasy or conception. But besides all this, in your case, the 
<A NAME="1052"></A>body, being tired and distressed with continual toil, naturally works upon 
<A NAME="1053"></A>the mind and keeps it in an excited and unusual condition. But that there 
<A NAME="1054"></A>should be any such thing as supernatural beings, or, if there were, that 
<A NAME="1055"></A>they should have human shape or voice or power that can reach to us, there 
<A NAME="1056"></A>is no reason for believing; though I confess I could wish that there were 
<A NAME="1057"></A>such beings, that we might not rely upon our arms only, and our horses 
<A NAME="1058"></A>and our navy, all which are so numerous and powerful, but might be confident 
<A NAME="1059"></A>of the assistance of gods also, in this our most sacred and honourable 
<A NAME="1060"></A>attempt." With such discourses as these Cassius soothed the mind of Brutus. 
<A NAME="1061"></A>But just as the troops were going on board, two eagles flew and lighted 
<A NAME="1062"></A>on the first two ensigns, and crossed over the water with them, and never 
<A NAME="1063"></A>ceased following the soldiers and being fed by them till they came to Philippi, 
<A NAME="1064"></A>and there, but one day before the fight, they both flew 
<A NAME="1065"></A>away.
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR><BR>Brutus had already reduced most of the places and people of these 
<A NAME="1067"></A>parts; but they now marched on as far as to the coast opposite Thasos, 
<A NAME="1068"></A>and, if there were any city or man of power that yet stood out, brought 
<A NAME="1069"></A>them all to subjection. At this point Norbanus was encamped, in a place 
<A NAME="1070"></A>called the Straits, near Symbolum. Him they surrounded in such sort that 
<A NAME="1071"></A>they forced him to dislodge and quit the place; and Norbanus narrowly escaped 
<A NAME="1072"></A>losing his whole army, Caesar by reason of sickness being too far behind; 
<A NAME="1073"></A>only Antony came to his relief with such wonderful swiftness that Brutus 
<A NAME="1074"></A>and those with him did not believe when they heard he was come. Caesar 
<A NAME="1075"></A>came up ten days after, and encamped over against Brutus, and Antony over 
<A NAME="1076"></A>against Cassius.
<A NAME="1077"></A><BR><BR>The space between the two armies is called by the Romans the Campi 
<A NAME="1078"></A>Philippi. Never had two such large Roman armies come together to engage 
<A NAME="1079"></A>each other. That of Brutus was somewhat less in number than that of Caesar, 
<A NAME="1080"></A>but in the splendidness of the men's arms and richness of their equipage 
<A NAME="1081"></A>it wonderfully exceeded; for most of their arms were of gold and silver, 
<A NAME="1082"></A>which Brutus had lavishly bestowed among them. For though in other things 
<A NAME="1083"></A>he had accustomed his commanders to use all frugality and self-control, 
<A NAME="1084"></A>yet he thought that the riches which soldiers carried about them in their 
<A NAME="1085"></A>hands and on their bodies would add something of spirit to those that were 
<A NAME="1086"></A>desirous of glory, and would make those that were covetous and
