<BR>(legendary, died 413 B.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>CRASSUS, in my opinion, may most properly be set against Nicias, and the 
<A NAME="11"></A>Parthian disaster compared with that in Sicily. But here it will be well 
<A NAME="12"></A>for me to entreat the reader, in all courtesy, not to think that I contend 
<A NAME="13"></A>with Thucydides in matters so pathetically, vividly, and eloquently, beyond 
<A NAME="14"></A>all imitation, and even beyond himself, expressed by him; nor to believe 
<A NAME="15"></A>me guilty of the like folly with Timaeus, who, hoping in his history to 
<A NAME="16"></A>surpass Thucydides in art, and to make Philistus appear a trifler and a 
<A NAME="17"></A>novice, pushes on in his descriptions, through all the battles, sea-fights, 
<A NAME="18"></A>and public speeches, in recording which they have been most successful, 
<A NAME="19"></A>without meriting so much as to be compared, in Pindar's phrase, 
<A NAME="20"></A>to-
<A NAME="21"></A><BR><BR>"One that on his feet
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>Would with the Lydian cars compete." He simply shows himself all along 
<A NAME="23"></A>a half-lettered, childish writer; in the words of Diphilus-
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR>" ---of wit obese,
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>O'erlarded with Sicilian grease." Often he sinks to the very level 
<A NAME="26"></A>of Xenarchus, telling us that he thinks it ominous to the Athenians that 
<A NAME="27"></A>their general, who had victory in his name, was unwilling to take command 
<A NAME="28"></A>in the expedition; and that the defacing of the Hermae was a divine intimation 
<A NAME="29"></A>that they should suffer much in the war by Hermocrates, the son of Hermon; 
<A NAME="30"></A>and, moreover, how it was likely that Hercules should aid the Syracusans 
<A NAME="31"></A>for the sake of Proserpine, by whose means he took Cerberus, and should 
<A NAME="32"></A>be angry with the Athenians for protecting the Egesteans, descended from 
<A NAME="33"></A>Trojan ancestors, whose city he, for an injury of their king Laomedon, 
<A NAME="34"></A>had overthrown. However, all these may be merely other instances of the 
<A NAME="35"></A>same happy taste that makes him correct the diction of Philistus, and abuse 
<A NAME="36"></A>Plato and Aristotle. This sort of contention and rivalry with others in 
<A NAME="37"></A>matter of style, to my mind, in any case, seems petty and pedantic, but 
<A NAME="38"></A>when its objects are works of inimitable excellence, it is absolutely senseless. 
<A NAME="39"></A>Such actions in Nicias's life as Thucydides and Philistus have related, 
<A NAME="40"></A>since they cannot be passed by, illustrating as they do most especially 
<A NAME="41"></A>his character and temper, under his many and great troubles, that I may 
<A NAME="42"></A>not seem altogether negligent, I shall briefly run over. And such things 
<A NAME="43"></A>as are not commonly known, and lie scattered here and there in other men's 
<A NAME="44"></A>writings, or are found amongst the old monuments and archives, I shall 
<A NAME="45"></A>endeavour to bring together; not collecting mere useless pieces of learning, 
<A NAME="46"></A>but adducing what may make his disposition and habit of mind 
<A NAME="47"></A>understood.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>First of all, I would mention what Aristotle has said of Nicias, 
<A NAME="49"></A>that there had been three good citizens eminent above the rest for their 
<A NAME="50"></A>hereditary affection and love to the people, Nicias the son of Niceratus, 
<A NAME="51"></A>Thucydides the son of Melesias, and Theramenes the son of Hagnon, but the 
<A NAME="52"></A>last less than the others; for he had his dubious extraction cast in his 
<A NAME="53"></A>teeth, as a foreigner from Ceos, and his inconstancy, which made him side 
<A NAME="54"></A>sometimes with one party, sometimes with another, in public life, and which 
<A NAME="55"></A>obtained him the nickname of the Buskin.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR>Thucydides came earlier, and, on the behalf of the nobility, was 
<A NAME="57"></A>a great opponent of the measures by which Pericles courted the favour of 
<A NAME="58"></A>the people.
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR>Nicias was a younger man, yet was in some reputation even whilst 
<A NAME="60"></A>Pericles lived; so much so as to have been his colleague in the office 
<A NAME="61"></A>of general, and to have held command by himself more than once. But on 
<A NAME="62"></A>the death of Pericles, he presently rose to the highest place, chiefly 
<A NAME="63"></A>by the favour of the rich and eminent citizens, who set him up for their 
<A NAME="64"></A>bulwark against the presumption and insolence of Cleon nevertheless, he 
<A NAME="65"></A>did not forfeit the good-will of the commonalty, who, likewise, contributed 
<A NAME="66"></A>to his advancement. For though Cleon got great influence by his 
<A NAME="67"></A>exertions-
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR>"---to please
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>The old men, who trusted him to find them fees," yet even those, for 
<A NAME="70"></A>whose interest and to gain whose favour he acted, nevertheless observing 
<A NAME="71"></A>the avarice, the arrogance, and the presumption of the man, many of them 
<A NAME="72"></A>supported Nicias. For his was not that sort of gravity which is harsh and 
<A NAME="73"></A>offensive, but he tempered it with a certain caution and deference, winning 
<A NAME="74"></A>upon the people, by seeming afraid of them. And being naturally diffident 
<A NAME="75"></A>and unhopeful in war, his good-fortune supplied his want of courage, and 
<A NAME="76"></A>kept it from being detected, as in all his commands he was constantly successful. 
<A NAME="77"></A>And his timorousness in civil life, and his extreme dread of accusers, 
<A NAME="78"></A>was thought very suitable in a citizen of a free state; and from the people's 
<A NAME="79"></A>good-will towards him, got him no small power over them, they being fearful 
<A NAME="80"></A>of all that despised them, but willing to promote one who seemed to be 
<A NAME="81"></A>afraid of them; the greatest compliment their betters could pay them being 
<A NAME="82"></A>not to contemn them.
<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR>Pericles, who by solid virtue and the pure force of argument ruled 
<A NAME="84"></A>the commonwealth, had stood in need of no disguises nor persuasions with 
<A NAME="85"></A>the people. Nicias, inferior in these respects, used his riches, of which 
<A NAME="86"></A>he had abundance, to gain popularity. Neither had he the nimble wit of 
<A NAME="87"></A>Cleon to win the Athenians to his purposes by amusing them with bold jests; 
<A NAME="88"></A>unprovided with such qualities, he courted them with dramatic exhibitions, 
<A NAME="89"></A>gymnastic games, and other public shows, more sumptuous and more splendid 
<A NAME="90"></A>than had been ever known in his or in former ages. Amongst his religious 
<A NAME="91"></A>offerings, there was extant, even in our days, the small figure of Minerva 
<A NAME="92"></A>in the citadel, having lost the gold that covered it; and a shrine in the 
<A NAME="93"></A>temple of Bacchus, under the tripods, that were presented by those who 
<A NAME="94"></A>won the prize in the shows or plays. For at these he had often carried 
<A NAME="95"></A>off the prize, and never once failed. We are told that on one of these 
<A NAME="96"></A>occasions, a slave of his appeared in the character of Bacchus, of a beautiful 
<A NAME="97"></A>person and noble stature, and with as yet no beard upon his chin; and on 
<A NAME="98"></A>the Athenians being pleased with the sight, and applauding a long time, 
<A NAME="99"></A>Nicias stood up, and said he could not in piety keep as a slave one whose 
<A NAME="100"></A>person had been consecrated to represent a god. And forthwith he set the 
<A NAME="101"></A>young man free. His performances at Delos are, also, on record, as noble 
<A NAME="102"></A>and magnificent works of devotion. For whereas the choruses which the cities 
<A NAME="103"></A>sent to sing hymns to the god were wont to arrive in no order, as it might 
<A NAME="104"></A>happen, and, being there met by a crowd of people crying out to them to 
<A NAME="105"></A>sing, in their hurry to begin, used to disembark confusedly, putting on 
<A NAME="106"></A>their garlands, and changing their dresses as they left the ships, he, 
<A NAME="107"></A>when he had to convoy the sacred company, disembarked the chorus at Rhenea, 
<A NAME="108"></A>together with the sacrifice, and other holy appurtenances. And having brought 
<A NAME="109"></A>along with him from Athens a bridge fitted by measurement for the purpose, 
<A NAME="110"></A>and magnificently adorned with gilding and colouring, and with garlands 
<A NAME="111"></A>and tapestries: this he laid in the night over the channel betwixt Rhenea 
<A NAME="112"></A>and Delos, being no great distance. And at break of day he marched forth 
<A NAME="113"></A>with all the procession to the god, and led the chorus, sumptuously ornamented, 
<A NAME="114"></A>and singing their hymns, along over the bridge. The sacrifices, the games, 
<A NAME="115"></A>and the feast being over, he set up a palm-tree of brass for a present 
<A NAME="116"></A>to the god, and bought a parcel of land with ten thousand drachmas which 
<A NAME="117"></A>he consecrated; with the revenue the inhabitants of Delos were to sacrifice 
<A NAME="118"></A>and to feast, and to pray the gods for many good things to Nicias. This 
<A NAME="119"></A>he engraved on a pillar, which he left in Delos to be a record of his bequest. 
<A NAME="120"></A>This same palm-tree, afterwards broken down by the wind, fell on the great 
<A NAME="121"></A>statue which the men of Naxos presented, and struck it to the 
<A NAME="122"></A>ground.
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>It is plain that much of this might be vainglory, and the mere 
<A NAME="124"></A>desire of popularity and applause; yet from other qualities and carriages 
<A NAME="125"></A>of the man one might believe all this cost and public display to be the 
<A NAME="126"></A>effect of devotion. For he was one of those who dreaded the divine powers 
<A NAME="127"></A>extremely, and, as Thucydides tells us, was much given to arts of divination. 
<A NAME="128"></A>In one of Pasiphon's dialogues, it is stated that he daily sacrificed to 
<A NAME="129"></A>the gods, and keeping a diviner at his house, professed to be consulting 
<A NAME="130"></A>always about the commonwealth, but for the most part inquired about his 
<A NAME="131"></A>own private affairs, more especially concerning his silver mines; for he 
<A NAME="132"></A>owned many works at Laurium, of great value, but somewhat hazardous to 
<A NAME="133"></A>carry on. He maintained there a multitude of slaves, and his wealth consisted 
<A NAME="134"></A>chiefly in silver. Hence he had many hangers-on about him, begging and 
<A NAME="135"></A>obtaining. For he gave to those who could do him mischief no less than 
<A NAME="136"></A>to those who deserved well. In short, his timidity was a revenue to rogues, 
<A NAME="137"></A>and his humanity to honest men. We find testimony in the comic writers, 
<A NAME="138"></A>as when Teleclides, speaking of one of the professed informers, 
<A NAME="139"></A>says-
<A NAME="140"></A><BR><BR>"Charicles gave the man a pound, the matter not to 
<A NAME="141"></A>name,
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>That from inside a money-bag into the world he came;
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>And Nicias, also, paid him four; I know the reason 
<A NAME="144"></A>well,
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>But Nicias is a worthy man, and so I will not tell." So, also, the 
<A NAME="146"></A>informer whom Eupolis introduces in his Maricas, attacking a good, simple, 
<A NAME="147"></A>poor man:-
<A NAME="148"></A><BR><BR>"How long ago did you and Nicias meet?
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>I did but see him just now in the street.
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR>The man has seen him and denies it not,
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>'Tis evident that they are in a plot.
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR>See you, O citizens! 'tis fact,
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>Nicias is taken in the act.
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR>Taken, Fools! take so good a man
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>In aught that's wrong none will or can."
<A NAME="156"></A><BR><BR>Cleon, in Aristophanes, makes it one of his 
<A NAME="157"></A>threats:-
<A NAME="158"></A><BR><BR>"I'll outscream all the speakers, and make Nicias stand aghast." 
<A NAME="159"></A>Phrynichus also implies his want of spirit and his easiness to be intimated 
<A NAME="160"></A>in the verses-
<A NAME="161"></A><BR><BR>"A noble man he was, I well can say,
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>Nor walked like Nicias, cowering on his way."
<A NAME="163"></A><BR><BR>So cautious was he of informers, and so reserved, that he never 
<A NAME="164"></A>would dine out with any citizen, nor allowed himself to indulge in talk 
<A NAME="165"></A>and conversation with his friends, nor give himself any leisure for such 
<A NAME="166"></A>amusements; but when he was general he used to stay at the office till 
<A NAME="167"></A>night, and was the first that came to the council-house, and the last that 
<A NAME="168"></A>left it. And if no public business engaged him, it was very hard to have 
<A NAME="169"></A>access, or to speak with him, he being retired at home and locked up. And 
<A NAME="170"></A>when any came to the door, some friend of his gave them good words, and 
<A NAME="171"></A>begged them to excuse him, Nicias was very busy; as if affairs of state 
<A NAME="172"></A>and public duties still kept him occupied. He who principally acted this 
<A NAME="173"></A>part for him, and contributed most to this state and show, was Hiero, a 
<A NAME="174"></A>man educated in Nicias's family, and instructed by him in letters and music. 
<A NAME="175"></A>He professed to be the son of Dionysius, surnamed Chalcus, whose poems 
<A NAME="176"></A>are yet extant, and had led out the colony to Italy and founded Thurii. 
<A NAME="177"></A>This Hiero transacted all his secrets for Nicias with the diviners; and 
<A NAME="178"></A>gave out to the people what a toilsome and miserable life he led for the 
<A NAME="179"></A>sake of the commonwealth. "He," said Hiero, "can never be either at the 
<A NAME="180"></A>bath or at his meat but some public business interferes. Careless of his 
<A NAME="181"></A>own and zealous for the public good, he scarcely ever goes to bed till 
<A NAME="182"></A>after others have had their first sleep. So that his health is impaired 
<A NAME="183"></A>and his body out of order, nor is he cheerful or affable with his friends, 
<A NAME="184"></A>but loses them as well as his money in the service of the state, while 
<A NAME="185"></A>other men gain friends by public speaking, enrich themselves, fare delicately 
<A NAME="186"></A>and make government their amusement." And in fact this was Nicias's manner 
<A NAME="187"></A>of life, so that he well might apply to himself the words of 
<A NAME="188"></A>Agamemnon:-
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR>"Vain pomp's the ruler of the life we live,
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>And a slave's service to the crowd we give."
<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR>He observed that the people, in the case of men of eloquence, or 
<A NAME="192"></A>of eminent parts, make use of their talents upon occasion, but were always 
<A NAME="193"></A>jealous of their abilities, and held a watchful eye upon them, taking all 
<A NAME="194"></A>opportunities to humble their pride and abate their reputation; as was 
<A NAME="195"></A>manifest in their condemnation of Pericles, their banishment of Damon, 
<A NAME="196"></A>their distrust of Antiphon the Rhamnusian, but especially in the case of 
<A NAME="197"></A>Paches who took Lesbos, who having to give an account of his conduct, in 
<A NAME="198"></A>the very court of justice unsheathed his sword and slew himself. Upon such 
<A NAME="199"></A>considerations, Nicias declined all difficult and lengthy enterprises; 
<A NAME="200"></A>if he took a command, he was for doing what was safe; and if, as thus was 
<A NAME="201"></A>likely, he had for the most part success, he did not attribute it to any 
<A NAME="202"></A>wisdom, conduct, or courage of his own, but, to avoid envy, he thanked 
<A NAME="203"></A>fortune for all, and gave the glory to the divine powers. And the actions 
<A NAME="204"></A>themselves bore testimony in his favour; the city met at that time with 
<A NAME="205"></A>several considerable reverses, but he had not a hand in any of them. The 
<A NAME="206"></A>Athenians were routed in Thrace by the Chalcidians, Calliades and Xenophon 
<A NAME="207"></A>commanding in chief. Demosthenes was the general when they were unfortunate 
<A NAME="208"></A>in Aetolia. At Delium they lost a thousand citizens under the conduct of 
<A NAME="209"></A>Hippocrates; the plague was principally laid to the charge of Pericles, 
<A NAME="210"></A>he, to carry on the war, having shut up close together in the town the 
<A NAME="211"></A>crowd of people from the country who, by the change of place, and of their 
<A NAME="212"></A>usual course of living, bred the pestilence. Nicias stood clear of all 
<A NAME="213"></A>this; under his conduct was taken Cythera, an island most commodious against 
<A NAME="214"></A>Laconia, and occupied by the Lacedaemonian settlers; many places, likewise, 
<A NAME="215"></A>in Thrace, which had revolted, were taken or won over by him; he shutting 
<A NAME="216"></A>up the Megarians within their town, seized upon the isle of Minoa; and 
<A NAME="217"></A>soon after, advancing from thence to Nisaea, made himself master there, 
<A NAME="218"></A>and then making a descent upon the Corinthian territory, fought a successful 
<A NAME="219"></A>battle, and slew a great number of the Corinthians with their captain Lycophron. 
<A NAME="220"></A>There it happened that two of his men were left by an oversight, when they 
<A NAME="221"></A>carried off the dead, which when he understood, he stopped the fleet, and 
<A NAME="222"></A>sent a herald to the enemy for leave to carry off the dead; though by law 
<A NAME="223"></A>and custom, he that by a truce craved leave to carry off the dead was hereby 
<A NAME="224"></A>supposed to give up all claim to the victory. Nor was it lawful for him 
<A NAME="225"></A>that did this to erect a trophy, for his is the victory who is master of 
<A NAME="226"></A>the field, and he is not master who asks leave, as wanting power to take. 
<A NAME="227"></A>But he chose rather to renounce his victory and his glory than to let two 
<A NAME="228"></A>citizens lie unburied. He scoured the coast of Laconia all along, and beat 
<A NAME="229"></A>the Lacedaemonians that made head against him. He took Thyrea, occupied 
<A NAME="230"></A>by the Aeginetans, and carried the prisoners to Athens.
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR>When Demosthenes had fortified Pylos, and the Peloponnesians brought 
<A NAME="232"></A>together both their sea and land-forces before it, after the fight, about 
<A NAME="233"></A>the number of four hundred native Spartans were left ashore in the isle 
<A NAME="234"></A>Sphacteria. The Athenians thought it a great prize, as indeed it was, to 
<A NAME="235"></A>take these men prisoners. But the siege, in places that wanted water, being 
<A NAME="236"></A>very difficult and untoward, and to convey necessaries about by sea in 
<A NAME="237"></A>summer tedious and expensive, in winter doubtful, or plainly impossible, 
<A NAME="238"></A>they began to be annoyed, and to repent their having rejected the embassy 
<A NAME="239"></A>of the Lacedaemonians, that had been sent to propose a treaty of peace, 
<A NAME="240"></A>which had been done at the importunity of Cleon, who opposed it chiefly 
<A NAME="241"></A>out of a pique to Nicias; for, being his enemy, and observing him to be 
<A NAME="242"></A>extremely solicitous to support the offers of the Lacedaemonians, he persuaded 
<A NAME="243"></A>the people to refuse them.
<A NAME="244"></A><BR><BR>Now, therefore, that the siege was protracted, and they heard of 
<A NAME="245"></A>the difficulties that pressed their army, they grew enraged against Cleon. 
<A NAME="246"></A>But he turned all the blame upon Nicias, charging it on his softness and 
<A NAME="247"></A>cowardice, that the besieged were not yet taken. "Were I general," said 
<A NAME="248"></A>he, "they should not hold out so long." The Athenians not unnaturally asked 
<A NAME="249"></A>the question, "Why, then, as it is, do not you go with a squadron against 
<A NAME="250"></A>them?" And Nicias standing up resigned his command at Pylos to him, and 
<A NAME="251"></A>bade him take what forces he pleased along with him, and not be bold in 
<A NAME="252"></A>words, out of harm's way, but go forth and perform some real service for 
<A NAME="253"></A>the commonwealth. Cleon, at the first, tried to draw back, disconcerted 
<A NAME="254"></A>at the proposal, which he had never expected; but the Athenians insisting, 
<A NAME="255"></A>and Nicias loudly upbraiding him, he thus provoked, and fired with ambition, 
<A NAME="256"></A>took upon him the charge, and said further, that within twenty days after 
<A NAME="257"></A>he embarked, he would either kill the enemy, upon the place, or bring them 
<A NAME="258"></A>alive to Athens. This the Athenians were readier to launch at than to believe, 
<A NAME="259"></A>as on other occasions, also, his bold assertions and extravagances used 
<A NAME="260"></A>to make them sport, and were pleasant enough. As, for instance, it is reported 
<A NAME="261"></A>that once when the people were assembled, and had waited his coming a long 
<A NAME="262"></A>time, at last he appeared with a garland on his head, and prayed them to 
<A NAME="263"></A>adjourn to the next day. "For," said he, "I am not at leisure to-day; I 
<A NAME="264"></A>have sacrificed to the gods, and am to entertain some strangers." Whereupon 
<A NAME="265"></A>the Athenians, laughing, rose up, and dissolved the assembly. However, 
<A NAME="266"></A>at this time he had good-fortune, and in conjunction with Demosthenes, 
<A NAME="267"></A>conducted the enterprise so well that, within the time he had limited, 
<A NAME="268"></A>he carried captive to Athens all the Spartans that had not fallen in 
<A NAME="269"></A>battle.
<A NAME="270"></A><BR><BR>This brought great disgrace on Nicias; for this was not to throw 
<A NAME="271"></A>away his shield, but something yet more shameful and ignominious, to quit 
<A NAME="272"></A>his charge voluntarily out of cowardice, and voting himself, as it were, 
<A NAME="273"></A>out of his command of his own accord, to put into his enemy's hand the 
<A NAME="274"></A>opportunity of achieving so brave an action. Aristophanes has a jest against 
<A NAME="275"></A>him on this occasion in the Birds:-
<A NAME="276"></A><BR><BR>"Indeed, not now the word that must be said
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>Is, do like Nicias, or retire to bed." And, again, in his 
<A NAME="278"></A>Husbandmen:-
<A NAME="279"></A><BR><BR>"I wish to stay at home and farm,
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>What then?
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>Who should prevent you?
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>You, my countrymen;
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>Whom I would pay a thousand drachmas down,
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>To let me give up office and leave town.
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>Enough; content; the sum two thousand is,
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>With those that Nicias paid to give up his."
<A NAME="287"></A><BR><BR>Besides all this, he did great mischief to the city by suffering 
<A NAME="288"></A>the accession of so much reputation and power to Cleon, who now assumed 
<A NAME="289"></A>such lofty airs, and allowed himself in such intolerable audacity, as led 
<A NAME="290"></A>to many unfortunate results, a sufficient part of which fell to his own 
<A NAME="291"></A>share. Amongst other things, he destroyed all the decorum of public speaking; 
<A NAME="292"></A>he was the first who ever broke out into exclamations, flung open his dress, 
<A NAME="293"></A>smote his thigh, and ran up and down whilst he was speaking, things which 
<A NAME="294"></A>soon after introduced, amongst those who managed the affairs of state, 
<A NAME="295"></A>such licence and contempt of decency as brought all into 
<A NAME="296"></A>confusion.
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR>Already, too, Alcibiades was beginning to show his strength at 
<A NAME="298"></A>Athens, a popular leader, not, indeed, as utterly violent as Cleon, but 
<A NAME="299"></A>as the land of Egypt, through the richness of its soil, is 
<A NAME="300"></A>said-
<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR>"---great plenty to produce,
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>Both wholesome herbs, and drugs of deadly juice," so the nature of 
<A NAME="303"></A>Alcibiades was strong and luxuriant in both kinds, and made way for many 
<A NAME="304"></A>serious innovations. Thus it fell out that after Nicias had got his hands 
<A NAME="305"></A>clear of Cleon, he had not opportunity to settle the city perfectly into 
<A NAME="306"></A>quietness. For having brought matters to a pretty hopeful condition, he 
<A NAME="307"></A>found everything carried away and plunged again into confusion by Alcibiades, 
<A NAME="308"></A>through the wildness and vehemence of his ambition, and all embroiled again 
<A NAME="309"></A>in war worse than ever. Which fell out thus. The persons who had principally 
<A NAME="310"></A>hindered the peace were Cleon and Brasidas. War setting off the virtue 
<A NAME="311"></A>of the one and hiding the villainy of the other, gave to the one occasions 
<A NAME="312"></A>of achieving brave actions, to the other opportunity of committing equal 
<A NAME="313"></A>dishonesties. Now when these two were in one battle both slain near Amphipolis, 
<A NAME="314"></A>Nicias was aware that the Spartans had long been desirous of a peace, and 
<A NAME="315"></A>that the Athenians had no longer the same confidence in the war. Both being 
<A NAME="316"></A>alike tired, and, as it were by consent, letting fall their hands, he, 
<A NAME="317"></A>therefore, in this nick of time, employed his efforts to make a friendship 
<A NAME="318"></A>betwixt the two cities, and to deliver the other states of Greece from 
<A NAME="319"></A>the evils and calamities they laboured under, and so establish his own 
<A NAME="320"></A>good name for success as a statesman for all future time. He found the 
<A NAME="321"></A>men of substance, the elder men, and the land-owners and farmers pretty 
<A NAME="322"></A>generally all inclined to peace. And when, in addition to these, by conversing 
<A NAME="323"></A>and reasoning, he had cooled the wishes of a good many others for war, 
<A NAME="324"></A>he now encouraged the hopes of the Lacedaemonians, and counselled them 
<A NAME="325"></A>to seek peace. They confided in him, as on account of his general character 
<A NAME="326"></A>for moderation and equity, so, also, because of the kindness and care he 
<A NAME="327"></A>had shown to the prisoners taken at Pylos and kept in confinement, making 
<A NAME="328"></A>their misfortune the more easy to them.
<A NAME="329"></A><BR><BR>The Athenians and the Spartans had before this concluded a truce 
<A NAME="330"></A>for a year, and during this, by associating with one another, they had 
<A NAME="331"></A>tasted again the sweets of peace and security and unimpeded intercourse 
<A NAME="332"></A>with friends and connections, and thus longed for an end of that fighting 
<A NAME="333"></A>and bloodshed, and heard with delight the chorus sing such verses 
<A NAME="334"></A>as-
<A NAME="335"></A><BR><BR>"----my lance I'll leave
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>Laid by, for spiders to o'erweave," and remembered with joy the saying, 
<A NAME="337"></A>In peace, they who sleep are awaked by the cock-crow, not by the trumpet. 
<A NAME="338"></A>So shutting their ears, with loud reproaches, to the forebodings of those 
<A NAME="339"></A>who said that the Fates decreed this to be a war of thrice nine years, 
<A NAME="340"></A>the whole question having been debated, they made a peace. And most people 
<A NAME="341"></A>thought, now, indeed, they had got an end of all their evils. And Nicias 
<A NAME="342"></A>was in every man's mouth, as one especially beloved of the gods, who, for 
<A NAME="343"></A>his piety and devotion, had been appointed to give a name to the fairest 
<A NAME="344"></A>and greatest of all blessings. For in fact they considered the peace Nicias's 
<A NAME="345"></A>work, as the war the work of Pericles; because he, on light occasions, 
<A NAME="346"></A>seemed to have plunged the Greeks into great calamities, while Nicias had 
<A NAME="347"></A>induced them to forget all the evils they had done each other and to be 
<A NAME="348"></A>friends again; and so to this day it is called the Peace of 
<A NAME="349"></A>Nicias.
<A NAME="350"></A><BR><BR>The articles being, that the garrisons and towns taken or, either 
<A NAME="351"></A>side and the prisoners should be restored, and they to restore the first 
<A NAME="352"></A>to whom it should fall by lot. Nicias, as Theophrastus tells us, by a sum 
<A NAME="353"></A>of money procured that the lot should fall for the Lacedaemonians to deliver 
<A NAME="354"></A>the first. Afterwards, when the Corinthians and the Boeotians showed their 
<A NAME="355"></A>dislike of what was done, and by their complaints and accusations were 
<A NAME="356"></A>well-nigh bringing the war back again, Nicias persuaded the Athenians and 
<A NAME="357"></A>the Lacedaemonians, besides the peace, to make a treaty of alliance, offensive 
<A NAME="358"></A>and defensive, as a tie and confirmation of the peace, which would make 
<A NAME="359"></A>them more terrible to those that held out, and the firmer to each other. 
<A NAME="360"></A>Whilst these matters were on foot, Alcibiades, who was no lover of tranquillity, 
<A NAME="361"></A>and who was offended with the Lacedaemonians because of their applications 
<A NAME="362"></A>and attentions to Nicias, while they overlooked and despised himself, from 
<A NAME="363"></A>first to last, indeed, had opposed the peace, though all in vain, but now 
<A NAME="364"></A>finding that the Lacedaemonians did not altogether continue to please the 
<A NAME="365"></A>Athenians, but were thought to have acted unfairly in having made a league 
<A NAME="366"></A>with the Boeotians, and had not given up Panactum, as they should have 
<A NAME="367"></A>done, with its fortifications unrazed, nor yet Amphipolis, he laid hold 
<A NAME="368"></A>on these occasions for his purpose, and availed himself of every one of 
<A NAME="369"></A>them to irritate the people. And, at length, sending for ambassadors from 
<A NAME="370"></A>the Argives, he exerted himself to effect a confederacy between the Athenians 
<A NAME="371"></A>and them. And now, when Lacedaemonian ambassadors were come with full powers, 
<A NAME="372"></A>and at their preliminary audience by the council seemed to come in all 
<A NAME="373"></A>points with just proposals, he, fearing that the general assembly, also, 
<A NAME="374"></A>would be won to their offers, overreached them with false professions and 
<A NAME="375"></A>oaths of assistance, on the condition that they would not avow that they 
<A NAME="376"></A>came with full powers; this, he said, being the only way for them to attain 
<A NAME="377"></A>their desires. They being over-persuaded and decoyed from Nicias to follow 
<A NAME="378"></A>him, he introduced them to the assembly, and asked them presently whether 
<A NAME="379"></A>or no they came in all points with full powers, which, when they denied, 
<A NAME="380"></A>he, contrary to their expectation, changing his countenance, called the 
<A NAME="381"></A>council to witness their words, and now bade the people beware how they 
<A NAME="382"></A>trust or transact anything with such manifest liars, who say at one time 
<A NAME="383"></A>one thing, and at another the very opposite upon the same subject. These 
<A NAME="384"></A>plenipotentiaries were, as well they might be, confounded at this, and 
<A NAME="385"></A>Nicias, also being at a loss what to say, and struck with amazement and 
<A NAME="386"></A>wonder, the assembly resolved to send immediately for the Argives, to enter 
<A NAME="387"></A>into a league with them. An earthquake, which interrupted the assembly, 
<A NAME="388"></A>made for Nicias's advantage; and the next day the people being again assembled, 
<A NAME="389"></A>after much speaking and soliciting, with great ado he brought it about 
<A NAME="390"></A>that the treaty with the Argives should be deferred, and he be sent to 
<A NAME="391"></A>the Lacedaemonians, in full expectation that so all would go 
<A NAME="392"></A>well.
<A NAME="393"></A><BR><BR>When he arrived at Sparta, they received him there as a good man, 
<A NAME="394"></A>and one well inclined towards them; yet he effected nothing, but, baffled 
<A NAME="395"></A>by the party that favoured the Boeotians, he returned home, not only dishonoured 
<A NAME="396"></A>and hardly spoken of, but likewise in fear of the Athenians, who were vexed 
<A NAME="397"></A>and enraged that through his persuasions they had released so many and 
<A NAME="398"></A>such considerable persons, their prisoners, for the men who had been brought 
<A NAME="399"></A>from Pylos were of the chiefest families of Sparta, and had those who were 
<A NAME="400"></A>highest there in place and power for their friends and kindred. Yet did 
<A NAME="401"></A>they not in their heat proceed against him, otherwise than that they chose 
<A NAME="402"></A>Alcibiades general, and took the Mantineans and Eleans, who had thrown 
<A NAME="403"></A>up their alliance with the Lacedaemonians, into the league, together with 
<A NAME="404"></A>the Argives, and sent to Pylos freebooters to infest Laconia, whereby the 
<A NAME="405"></A>war began to break out afresh.
<A NAME="406"></A><BR><BR>But the enmity betwixt Nicias and Alcibiades running higher and 
<A NAME="407"></A>higher, and the time being at hand for decreeing the ostracism or banishment, 
<A NAME="408"></A>for ten years, which the people, putting the name on a sherd, were wont 
<A NAME="409"></A>to inflict at certain times on some person suspected or regarded with jealousy 
<A NAME="410"></A>for his popularity or wealth, both were now in alarm and apprehension, 
<A NAME="411"></A>one of them, in all likelihood, being to undergo this ostracism; as the 
<A NAME="412"></A>people abominated the life of Alcibiades, and stood in fear of his boldness 
<A NAME="413"></A>and resolution, as is shown particularly in the history of him; while as 
<A NAME="414"></A>for Nicias, his riches made him envied, and his habits of living, in particular 
<A NAME="415"></A>his unsociable and exclusive ways, not like those of a fellow-citizen, 
<A NAME="416"></A>or even a fellow-man, went against him, and having many times opposed their 
<A NAME="417"></A>inclinations, forcing them against their feelings to do what was their 
<A NAME="418"></A>interest, he had got himself disliked.
<A NAME="419"></A><BR><BR>To speak plainly, it was a contest of the young men who were eager 
<A NAME="420"></A>for war, against the men of years and lovers of peace, they turning the 
<A NAME="421"></A>ostracism upon the one, these upon the other. But-
<A NAME="422"></A><BR><BR>"In civil strife e'en villains rise to fame." And so now it happened 
<A NAME="423"></A>that the city, distracted into two factions, allowed free course to the 
<A NAME="424"></A>most impudent and profligate persons, among whom was Hyperbolus of the 
<A NAME="425"></A>Perithoedae, one who could not, indeed, be said to be presuming upon any 
<A NAME="426"></A>power, but rather by his presumption rose into power, and by the honour 
<A NAME="427"></A>he found in the city, became the scandal of it. He, at this time, thought 
<A NAME="428"></A>himself far enough from the ostracism, as more properly deserving, the 
<A NAME="429"></A>slave's gallows, and made account, that one of these men being, despatched 
<A NAME="430"></A>out of the way he might be able to play a part against the other that should 
<A NAME="431"></A>be left, and openly showed his pleasure at the dissension, and his desire 
<A NAME="432"></A>to inflame the people against both of them. Nicias and Alcibiades, perceiving 
<A NAME="433"></A>his malice, secretly combined together, and setting both their interests 
<A NAME="434"></A>jointly at work, succeeded in fixing the ostracism not on either of them, 
<A NAME="435"></A>but even on Hyperbolus. This, indeed, at the first made sport, and raised 
<A NAME="436"></A>laughter among the people; but afterwards it was felt as an affront, that 
<A NAME="437"></A>the thing should be dishonoured by being employed upon so unworthy a subject; 
<A NAME="438"></A>punishment, also, having its proper dignity, and ostracism being one that 
<A NAME="439"></A>was appropriate rather for Thucydides, Aristides, and such like persons; 
<A NAME="440"></A>whereas for Hyperbolus it was a glory, and a fair ground for boasting on 
<A NAME="441"></A>his part, when for his villainy he suffered the same with the best men. 
<A NAME="442"></A>As Plato, the comic poet, said of him:-
<A NAME="443"></A><BR><BR>"The man deserved the fate, deny who can;
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>Yes, but the fate did not deserve the man;
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>Not for the like of him and his slave-brands,
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>Did Athens put the sherd into our hands."
<A NAME="447"></A><BR><BR>And, in fact, none ever afterwards suffered this sort of punishment, 
<A NAME="448"></A>but Hyperbolus was the last, as Hipparchus the Cholargian, who was kin 
<A NAME="449"></A>to the tyrant, was the first.
<A NAME="450"></A><BR><BR>There is no judgment to be made of fortune; nor can any reasoning 
<A NAME="451"></A>bring us to a certainty about it. If Nicias had run the risk with Alcibiades 
<A NAME="452"></A>whether of the two should undergo the ostracism, he had either prevailed, 
<A NAME="453"></A>and, his rival being expelled the city, he had remained secure; or, being 
<A NAME="454"></A>overcome, he had avoided the utmost disasters, and preserved the reputation 
<A NAME="455"></A>of a most excellent commander. Meantime I am not ignorant that Theophrastus 
<A NAME="456"></A>says, that when Hyperbolus was banished, Phaeax, not Nicias, contested 
<A NAME="457"></A>it with Alcibiades; but most authors differ from him.
<A NAME="458"></A><BR><BR>It was Alcibiades, at any rate, whom when the Aegestean and Leontine 
<A NAME="459"></A>ambassadors arrived and urged the Athenians to make an expedition against 
<A NAME="460"></A>Sicily, Nicias opposed, and by whose persuasions and ambition he found 
<A NAME="461"></A>himself overborne, who, even before the people could be assembled, had 
<A NAME="462"></A>preoccupied and corrupted their judgment with hopes and with speeches; 
<A NAME="463"></A>insomuch that the young men at their sports, and the old men in their workshops, 
<A NAME="464"></A>and sitting together on the benches, would be drawing maps of Sicily, and 
<A NAME="465"></A>making charts showing the seas, the harbours, and general character of 
<A NAME="466"></A>the coast of the island opposite Africa. For they made not Sicily the end 
<A NAME="467"></A>of the war but rather its starting-point and headquarters from whence they 
<A NAME="468"></A>might carry it to the Carthaginians, and possess themselves of Africa, 
<A NAME="469"></A>and of the seas as far as the pillars of Hercules. The bulk of the people, 
<A NAME="470"></A>therefore, pressing this way, Nicias, who opposed them, found but few supporters, 
<A NAME="471"></A>nor those of much influence; for the men of substance, fearing lest they 
<A NAME="472"></A>should seem to shun the public charges and ship-money, were quiet against 
<A NAME="473"></A>their inclination; nevertheless he did not tire nor give it up, but even 
<A NAME="474"></A>after the Athenians decreed a war and chose him in the first place general, 
<A NAME="475"></A>together with Alcibiades and Lamachus, when they were again assembled, 
<A NAME="476"></A>he stood up, dissuaded them, and protested against the decision, and laid 
<A NAME="477"></A>the blame on Alcibiades, charging him with going about to involve the city 
<A NAME="478"></A>in foreign dangers and difficulties, merely with a view to his own private 
<A NAME="479"></A>lucre and ambition. Yet it came to nothing. Nicias, because of his experience, 
<A NAME="480"></A>was looked upon as the fitter for the employment, and his wariness with 
<A NAME="481"></A>the bravery of Alcibiades, and the easy temper of Lamachus, all compounded 
<A NAME="482"></A>together, promised such security, that he did but confirm the resolution. 
<A NAME="483"></A>Demostratus, who, of the popular leaders, was the one who chiefly pressed 
<A NAME="484"></A>the Athenians to the expedition, stood up and said he would stop the mouth 
<A NAME="485"></A>of Nicias from urging any more excuses, and moved that the generals should 
<A NAME="486"></A>have absolute power, both at home and abroad, to order and to act as they 
<A NAME="487"></A>thought best; and this vote the people passed.
<A NAME="488"></A><BR><BR>The priests, however, are said to have very earnestly opposed the 
<A NAME="489"></A>enterprise. But Alcibiades had his diviners of another sort, who from some 
<A NAME="490"></A>old prophecies announced that "there shall be great fame of the Athenians 
<A NAME="491"></A>in Sicily," and messengers came back to him from Jupiter Ammon with oracles 
<A NAME="492"></A>importing that "the Athenians shall take all the Syracusans." Those, meanwhile, 
<A NAME="493"></A>who knew anything that boded ill, concealed it lest they might seem to 
<A NAME="494"></A>fore-speak ill-luck. For even prodigies that were obvious and plain would 
<A NAME="495"></A>not deter them; not the defacing of the Hermae, all maimed in one night 
<A NAME="496"></A>except one, called the Hermes of Andocides, erected by the tribe of Aegeus, 
<A NAME="497"></A>placed directly before the house then occupied by Andocides; or what was 
<A NAME="498"></A>perpetrated on the altar of the twelve gods, upon which a certain man leaped 
<A NAME="499"></A>suddenly up, and then turning round mutilated himself with a stone. Likewise 
<A NAME="500"></A>at Delphi there stood a golden image of Minerva, set on a palm-tree of 
<A NAME="501"></A>brass, erected by the city of Athens from the spoils they won from the 
<A NAME="502"></A>Medes; this was pecked at several days together by crows flying upon it, 
<A NAME="503"></A>who also plucked off and knocked down the fruit, made of gold, upon the 
<A NAME="504"></A>palm-tree. But the Athenians said these were all but inventions of the 
<A NAME="505"></A>Delphians, corrupted by the men of Syracuse. A certain oracle bade them 
<A NAME="506"></A>bring from Clazomenae the priestess of Minerva there; they sent for the 
<A NAME="507"></A>woman and found her named Hesychia, Quietness, this being, it would seem, 
<A NAME="508"></A>what the divine powers advised the city at this time, to be quiet. Whether, 
<A NAME="509"></A>therefore, the astrologer Meton feared these presages, or that from human 
<A NAME="510"></A>reason he doubted its success (for he was appointed to a command in it), 
<A NAME="511"></A>feigning himself mad, he set his house on fire. Others say he did not counterfeit 
<A NAME="512"></A>madness, but set his house on fire in the night, and the next morning came 
<A NAME="513"></A>before the assembly in great distress, and besought the people, in consideration 
<A NAME="514"></A>of the sad disaster, to release his son from the service, who was about 
<A NAME="515"></A>to go captain of a galley for Sicily. The genius, also, of the philosopher 
<A NAME="516"></A>Socrates, on this occasion, too, gave him intimation by the usual tokens, 
<A NAME="517"></A>that the expedition would prove the ruin of the commonwealth; this he imparted 
<A NAME="518"></A>to his friends and familiars, and by them it was mentioned to a number 
<A NAME="519"></A>of people. Not a few were troubled because the days on which the fleet 
<A NAME="520"></A>set sail happened to be the time when the women celebrated the death of 
<A NAME="521"></A>Adonis; there being everywhere then exposed to view images of dead men, 
<A NAME="522"></A>carried about with mourning and lamentation, and women beating their breasts. 
<A NAME="523"></A>So that such as laid any stress on these matters were extremely troubled, 
<A NAME="524"></A>and feared lest that all this warlike preparation, so splendid and so glorious, 
<A NAME="525"></A>should suddenly, in a little time, be blasted in its very prime of magnificence, 
<A NAME="526"></A>and come to nothing.
<A NAME="527"></A><BR><BR>Nicias, in opposing the voting of this expedition, and neither 
<A NAME="528"></A>being puffed up with hopes, nor transported with the honour of his high 
<A NAME="529"></A>command so as to modify his judgment, showed himself a man of virtue and 
<A NAME="530"></A>constancy. But when his endeavours could not diverge the people from the 
<A NAME="531"></A>war, nor get leave for himself to be discharged of the command, but the 
<A NAME="532"></A>people, as it were, violently him took up and carried him, and against 
<A NAME="533"></A>his will put him in the office of general, this was no longer now a time 
<A NAME="534"></A>for his excessive caution and his delays, nor was it for him, like a child, 
<A NAME="535"></A>to look back from the ship, often repeating and reconsidering over and 
<A NAME="536"></A>over again how that his advice had not been over-ruled by fair arguments, 
<A NAME="537"></A>thus blunting the courage of his fellow-commanders and spoiling the season 
<A NAME="538"></A>of action. Whereas, he ought speedily to have closed with the enemy and 
<A NAME="539"></A>brought the matter to an issue, and put fortune immediately to the test 
<A NAME="540"></A>in battle. But, on the contrary, when Lamachus counselled to sail directly 
<A NAME="541"></A>to Syracuse, and fight the enemy under their city walls, and Alcibiades 
<A NAME="542"></A>advised to secure the friendship of the other towns, and then to march 
<A NAME="543"></A>against them, Nicias dissented from them both, and insisted that they should 
<A NAME="544"></A>cruise quietly around the island and display their armament, and having 
<A NAME="545"></A>landed a small supply of men for the Egesteans, return to Athens, weakening 
<A NAME="546"></A>at once the resolution and casting down the spirits of the men. And while, 
<A NAME="547"></A>a little while after, the Athenians called home Alcibiades in order to 
<A NAME="548"></A>his trial, he being, though joined nominally with another in commission, 
<A NAME="549"></A>in effect the only general, made now no end of loitering, of cruising, 
<A NAME="550"></A>and considering, till their hopes were grown stale, and all the disorder 
<A NAME="551"></A>and consternation which the first approach and view of their forces had 
<A NAME="552"></A>cast amongst the enemy was worn off and had left them.
<A NAME="553"></A><BR><BR>Whilst yet Alcibiades was with the fleet, they went before Syracuse 
<A NAME="554"></A>with a squadron of sixty galleys, fifty of them lying in array without 
<A NAME="555"></A>the harbour, while the other ten rowed in to reconnoitre, and by a herald 
<A NAME="556"></A>called upon the citizens of Leontini to return to their own country. These 
<A NAME="557"></A>scouts took a galley of the enemy's, in which they found certain tablets, 
<A NAME="558"></A>on which was set down a list of all the Syracusans, according to their 
<A NAME="559"></A>tribes. These were wont to be laid up at a distance from the city, in the 
<A NAME="560"></A>temple of Jupiter Olympius, but were now brought forth for examination 
<A NAME="561"></A>to furnish a muster-roll of young men for the war. These being so taken 
<A NAME="562"></A>by the Athenians, and carried to the officers, and the multitude of names 
<A NAME="563"></A>appearing, the diviners thought it unpropitious, and were in apprehension 
<A NAME="564"></A>lest this should be the only destined fulfillment of the prophecy, that 
<A NAME="565"></A>"the Athenians shall take all the Syracusans." Yet, indeed, this was said 
<A NAME="566"></A>to be accomplished by the Athenians at another time, when Callippus the 
<A NAME="567"></A>Athenian, having slain Dion, became master of Syracuse, But when Alcibiades 
<A NAME="568"></A>shortly after sailed away from Sicily, the command fell wholly to Nicias. 
<A NAME="569"></A>Lamachus was, indeed, a brave and honest man, and ready to fight fearlessly 
<A NAME="570"></A>with his own hand in battle, but so poor and ill-off that, whenever he 
<A NAME="571"></A>was appointed general, he used always, in accounting for his outlay of 
<A NAME="572"></A>public money, to bring some little reckoning or other of money for his 
<A NAME="573"></A>very clothes and shoes. On the contrary, Nicias, as on other accounts, 
<A NAME="574"></A>so, also, because of his wealth and station, was very much thought of. 
<A NAME="575"></A>The story is told that once upon a time the commission of generals being 
<A NAME="576"></A>in consultation together in their public office, he bade Sophocles the 
<A NAME="577"></A>poet give his opinion first, as the senior of the board. "I," replied Sophocles, 
<A NAME="578"></A>"am the older, but you are the senior." And so now, also, Lamachus, who 
<A NAME="579"></A>better understood military affairs, being quite his subordinate, he himself, 
<A NAME="580"></A>evermore delaying and avoiding risk, and faintly employing his forces, 
<A NAME="581"></A>first by his sailing about Sicily at the greatest distance aloof from the 
<A NAME="582"></A>enemy, gave them confidence, then by afterwards attacking Hybla, a petty 
<A NAME="583"></A>fortress, and drawing off before he could take it, make himself utterly 
<A NAME="584"></A>despised. At the last he retreated to Catana without having achieved anything, 
<A NAME="585"></A>save that he demolished Hyccara, an humble town of the barbarians, out 
<A NAME="586"></A>of which, the story goes, that Lais the courtesan, yet a mere girl, was 
<A NAME="587"></A>sold amongst the other prisoners, and carried thence away to 
<A NAME="588"></A>Peloponnesus.
<A NAME="589"></A><BR><BR>But when the summer was spent, after reports began to reach him 
<A NAME="590"></A>that the Syracusans were grown so confident that they would come first 
<A NAME="591"></A>to attack him, and troopers skirmishing to the very camp twitted his soldiers, 
<A NAME="592"></A>asking whether they came to settle with the Catanians, or to put the Leontines 
<A NAME="593"></A>in possession of their city, at last, with much ado, Nicias resolved to 
<A NAME="594"></A>sail against Syracuse. And wishing to form his camp safely and without 
<A NAME="595"></A>molestation, he procured a man to carry from Catana intelligence to the 
<A NAME="596"></A>Syracusans that they might seize the camp of the Athenians unprotected, 
<A NAME="597"></A>and all their arms, if on such a day they should march with all their forces 
<A NAME="598"></A>to Catana; and that, the Athenians living mostly in the town, the friends 
<A NAME="599"></A>of the Syracusans had concerted, as soon as they should perceive them coming, 
<A NAME="600"></A>to possess themselves of one of the gates, and to fire the arsenal; that 
<A NAME="601"></A>many now were in the conspiracy and awaited their arrival. This was the 
<A NAME="602"></A>ablest thing Nicias did in the whole of his conduct of the expedition. 
<A NAME="603"></A>For having drawn out all the strength of the enemy, and made the city destitute 
<A NAME="604"></A>of men, he set out from Catana, entered the harbour, and chose a fit place 
<A NAME="605"></A>for his camp, where the enemy could least incommode him with the means 
<A NAME="606"></A>in which they were superior to him, while with the means in which he was 
<A NAME="607"></A>superior to them he might expect to carry on the war without 
<A NAME="608"></A>impediment.
<A NAME="609"></A><BR><BR>When the Syracusans returned from Catana, and stood in battle array 
<A NAME="610"></A>before the city gates, he rapidly led up the Athenians and fell on them 
<A NAME="611"></A>and defeated them, but did not kill many, their horse hindering the pursuit. 
<A NAME="612"></A>And his cutting and breaking down the bridges that lay over the river gave 
<A NAME="613"></A>Hermocrates, when cheering up the Syracusans, occasion to say that Nicias 
<A NAME="614"></A>was ridiculous, whose great aim seemed to be to avoid fighting, as if fighting 
<A NAME="615"></A>were not the thing he came for. However, he put the Syracusans into a very 
<A NAME="616"></A>great alarm and consternation, so that instead of fifteen generals then 
<A NAME="617"></A>in service, they chose three others, to whom the people engaged by oath 
<A NAME="618"></A>to allow absolute authority.
<A NAME="619"></A><BR><BR>There stood near them the temple of Jupiter Olympius, which the 
<A NAME="620"></A>Athenians (there being in it many consecrated things of gold and silver) 
<A NAME="621"></A>were eager to take, but were purposely withheld from it by Nicias, who 
<A NAME="622"></A>let the opportunity slip, and allowed a garrison of the Syracusans to enter 
<A NAME="623"></A>it, judging that if the soldiers should make booty of that wealth it would 
<A NAME="624"></A>be no advantage to the public, and he should bear the guilt of the impiety. 
<A NAME="625"></A>Not improving in the least this success, which was everywhere famous, after 
<A NAME="626"></A>a few days' stay, away he goes to Naxos, and there winters, spending largely 
<A NAME="627"></A>for the maintenance of so great an army, and not doing anything except 
<A NAME="628"></A>some matters of little consequence with some native Sicilians that revolted 
<A NAME="629"></A>to him. Insomuch that the Syracusans took heart again, made excursions 
<A NAME="630"></A>to Catana, wasted the country, and fired the camp of the Athenians. For 
<A NAME="631"></A>which everybody blamed Nicias, who, with his long reflection, his deliberateness, 
<A NAME="632"></A>and his caution, had let slip the time for action. None ever found fault 
<A NAME="633"></A>with the man when once at work, for in the brunt he showed vigour and activity 
<A NAME="634"></A>enough, but was slow and wanted assurance to engage.
<A NAME="635"></A><BR><BR>When, therefore, he brought again the army to Syracuse, such was 
<A NAME="636"></A>his conduct, and with such celerity, and at the same time security, he 
<A NAME="637"></A>came upon them, that nobody knew of his approach, when already he, had 
<A NAME="638"></A>come to shore with his galleys at Thapsus, and had landed his men; and 
<A NAME="639"></A>before any could help it, he had surprised Epipolae, had defeated the body 
<A NAME="640"></A>of picked men that came to its succour, took three hundred prisoners, and 
<A NAME="641"></A>routed the cavalry of the enemy, which had been thought invincible. But 
<A NAME="642"></A>what chiefly astonished the Syracusans, and seemed incredible to the Greeks, 
<A NAME="643"></A>was in so short a space of time the walling about of Syracuse, a town not 
<A NAME="644"></A>less than Athens, and far more difficult, by the unevenness of the ground, 
<A NAME="645"></A>and the nearness of the sea and the marshes adjacent, to have such a wall 
<A NAME="646"></A>drawn in a circle round it; yet this, all within a very little, finished 
<A NAME="647"></A>by a man that had not even his health for such weighty cares, but lay ill 
<A NAME="648"></A>of the stone, which may justly bear the blame for what was left undone. 
<A NAME="649"></A>I admire the industry of the general, and the bravery of the soldiers for 
<A NAME="650"></A>what they succeeded in. Euripides, after their ruin and disaster, writing 
<A NAME="651"></A>their funeral elegy, said that-
<A NAME="652"></A><BR><BR>"Eight victories over Syracuse they gained,
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>While equal yet to both the gods remained." And in truth one shall 
<A NAME="654"></A>not find eight, but many more victories, won by these men against the Syracusans, 
<A NAME="655"></A>till the gods, in real truth, or fortune intervened to check the Athenians 
<A NAME="656"></A>in this advance to the height of power and greatness.
<A NAME="657"></A><BR><BR>Nicias, therefore, doing violence to his body, was present in most 
<A NAME="658"></A>actions. But once, when his disease was the sharpest upon him, he lay in 
<A NAME="659"></A>the camp with some few servants to attend him. And Lamachus having the 
<A NAME="660"></A>command fought the Syracusans, who were bringing a cross-wall from the 
<A NAME="661"></A>city along to that of the Athenians, to hinder them from carrying it round; 
<A NAME="662"></A>and in the victory, the Athenians hurrying in some disorder to the pursuit, 
<A NAME="663"></A>Lamachus getting separated from his men, had to resist the Syracusan horse 
<A NAME="664"></A>that came upon him. Before the rest advanced Callicrates, a man of good 
<A NAME="665"></A>courage and skill in war. Lamachus, upon a challenge, engaged with him 
<A NAME="666"></A>in single combat, and receiving the first wound, returned it so home to 
<A NAME="667"></A>Callicrates, that they both fell and died together. The Syracusans took 
<A NAME="668"></A>away his body and arms, and at full speed advanced to the wall of the Athenians, 
<A NAME="669"></A>where Nicias lay without any troops to oppose to them, yet roused by this 
<A NAME="670"></A>necessity, and seeing the danger, he bade those about him go and set on 
<A NAME="671"></A>fire all the wood and materials that lay provided before the wall for the 
<A NAME="672"></A>engines, and the engines themselves; this put a stop to the Syracusans, 
<A NAME="673"></A>saved Nicias, saved the walls and all the money of the Athenians. For when 
<A NAME="674"></A>the Syracusans saw such a fire blazing up between them and the wall, they 
<A NAME="675"></A>retired.
<A NAME="676"></A><BR><BR>Nicias now remained sole general, and with great prospects; for 
<A NAME="677"></A>cities began to come over to alliance with him, and ships laden with corn 
<A NAME="678"></A>from every coast came to the camp, every one favouring when matters went 
<A NAME="679"></A>well. And some proposals from among the Syracusans despairing to defend 
<A NAME="680"></A>the city, about a capitulation, were already conveyed to him. And in fact 
<A NAME="681"></A>Gylippus, who was on his way with a squadron to their aid from Lacedaemon, 
<A NAME="682"></A>hearing on his voyage of the wall surrounding them, and of their distress, 
<A NAME="683"></A>only continued his enterprise thenceforth, that, giving Sicily up for lost, 
<A NAME="684"></A>he might, if even that should be possible, secure the Italians their cities. 
<A NAME="685"></A>For a strong report was everywhere spread about that the Athenians carried 
<A NAME="686"></A>all before them, and had a general alike for conduct and for fortune 
<A NAME="687"></A>invincible.
<A NAME="688"></A><BR><BR>And Nicias himself, too, now against his nature grown bold in his 
<A NAME="689"></A>present strength and success, especially from the intelligence he received 
<A NAME="690"></A>underhand of the Syracusans, believing they would almost immediately surrender 
<A NAME="691"></A>the town upon terms, paid no manner of regard to Gylippus coming to their 
<A NAME="692"></A>assistance, nor kept any watch of his approach, so that, neglected altogether 
<A NAME="693"></A>and despised, Gylippus went in a long-boat ashore without the knowledge 
<A NAME="694"></A>of Nicias, and, having landed in the remotest parts from Syracuse, mustered 
<A NAME="695"></A>up a considerable force, the Syracusans not so much as knowing of his arrival 
<A NAME="696"></A>nor expecting him; so that an assembly was summoned to consider the terms 
<A NAME="697"></A>to be arranged with Nicias, and some were actually on the way, thinking 
<A NAME="698"></A>it essential to have all despatched before the town should be quite walled 
<A NAME="699"></A>round, for now there remained very little to be done, and the materials 
<A NAME="700"></A>for the building lay all ready along the line.
<A NAME="701"></A><BR><BR>In this very nick of time and danger arrived Gongylus in one galley 
<A NAME="702"></A>from Corinth, and every one, as may be imagined, flocking about him, he 
<A NAME="703"></A>told them that Gylippus would be with them speedily, and that other ships 
<A NAME="704"></A>were coming to relieve them. And, ere yet they could perfectly believe 
<A NAME="705"></A>Gongylus, an express was brought from Gylippus, to bid them go forth to 
<A NAME="706"></A>meet him. So now taking good heart, they armed themselves; and Gylippus 
<A NAME="707"></A>at once led on his men from their march in battle array against the Athenians, 
<A NAME="708"></A>as Nicias also embattled these. And Gylippus, piling his arms in view of 
<A NAME="709"></A>the Athenians, sent a herald to tell them he would give them leave to depart 
<A NAME="710"></A>from Sicily without molestation. To this Nicias would not vouchsafe any 
<A NAME="711"></A>answer, but some of his soldiers laughing, asked if with the sight of one 
<A NAME="712"></A>coarse coat and Laconian staff the Syracusan prospects had become so brilliant 
<A NAME="713"></A>that they could despise the Athenians, who had released to the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="714"></A>three hundred, whom they held in chains, bigger men than Gylippus, and 
<A NAME="715"></A>longer-haired? Timaeus, also, writes that even the Syracusans made no account 
<A NAME="716"></A>of Gylippus, at the first sight mocking at his staff and long hair, as 
<A NAME="717"></A>afterwards they found reason to blame his covetousness and meanness. The 
<A NAME="718"></A>same author, however, adds that on Gylippus's first appearance, as it might 
<A NAME="719"></A>have been at the sight of an owl abroad in the air, there was a general 
<A NAME="720"></A>flocking together of men to serve in the war. And this is the truer saying 
<A NAME="721"></A>of the two; for in the staff and the cloak they saw the badge and authority 
<A NAME="722"></A>of Sparta, and crowded to him accordingly. And not only Thucydides affirms 
<A NAME="723"></A>that the whole thing was done by him alone, but so, also, does Philistus, 
<A NAME="724"></A>who was a Syracusan and an actual witness of what happened.
<A NAME="725"></A><BR><BR>However, the Athenians had the better in the first encounter, and 
<A NAME="726"></A>slew some few of the Syracusans, and amongst them Gongylus of Corinth. 
<A NAME="727"></A>But on the next day Gylippus, showed what it is to be a man of experience; 
<A NAME="728"></A>for with the same arms, the same horses, and on the same spot of ground, 
<A NAME="729"></A>only employing them otherwise, he overcame the Athenians; and they fleeing 
<A NAME="730"></A>to their camp, he set the Syracusans to work, and with the stone and materials 
<A NAME="731"></A>that had been brought together for finishing the wall of the Athenians, 
<A NAME="732"></A>he built a cross-wall to intercept theirs and break it off, so that even 
<A NAME="733"></A>if they were successful in the field, they would not be able to do anything. 
<A NAME="734"></A>And after this the Syracusans taking courage manned their galleys, and 
<A NAME="735"></A>with their horse and followers ranging about took a good many prisoners; 
<A NAME="736"></A>and Gylippus going himself to the cities, called upon them to join with 
<A NAME="737"></A>him, and was listened to and supported vigorously by them. So that Nicias 
<A NAME="738"></A>fell back again to his old views, and, seeing the face of affairs change, 
<A NAME="739"></A>desponded, and wrote to Athens, bidding them either send another army, 
<A NAME="740"></A>or recall this out of Sicily, and that he might, in any case, he wholly 
<A NAME="741"></A>relieved of the command, because of his disease.
<A NAME="742"></A><BR><BR>Before this the Athenians had been intending to send another army 
<A NAME="743"></A>to Sicily, but envy of Nicias's early achievements and high fortune had 
<A NAME="744"></A>occasioned, up to this time, many delays; but now they were all eager to 
<A NAME="745"></A>send off succours. Eurymedon went before, in midwinter, with money, and 
<A NAME="746"></A>to announce that Euthydemus and Menander were chosen out of those that 
<A NAME="747"></A>served there under Nicias to be joint commanders with him. Demosthenes 
<A NAME="748"></A>was to go after in the spring with a great armament. In the meantime Nicias 
<A NAME="749"></A>was briskly attacked, both by sea and land; in the beginning he had the 
<A NAME="750"></A>disadvantage on the water, but in the end repulsed and sunk many galleys 
<A NAME="751"></A>of the enemy. But by land he could not provide succour in time, so Gylippus 
<A NAME="752"></A>surprised and captured Plemmyrium, in which the stores for the navy, and 
<A NAME="753"></A>a great sum of money being there kept, all fell into his hands, and many 
<A NAME="754"></A>were slain, and many taken prisoners. And what was of greatest importance, 
<A NAME="755"></A>he now cut off Nicias's supplies, which had been safely and readily conveyed 
<A NAME="756"></A>to him under Plemmyrium, while the Athenians still held it, but now that 
<A NAME="757"></A>they were beaten out, he could only procure them with great difficulty, 
<A NAME="758"></A>and with opposition from the enemy, who lay in wait with their ships under 
<A NAME="759"></A>that fort. Moreover, it seemed manifest to the Syracusans that their navy 
<A NAME="760"></A>had not been beaten by strength, but by their disorder in the pursuit. 
<A NAME="761"></A>Now, therefore, all hands went to work to prepare for a new attempt that 
<A NAME="762"></A>should succeed better than the former. Nicias had no wish for a sea-fight, 
<A NAME="763"></A>but said it was mere folly for them, when Demosthenes was coming in all 
<A NAME="764"></A>haste with so great a fleet and fresh forces to their succour, to engage 
<A NAME="765"></A>the enemy with a less number of ships and ill provided. But, on the other 
<A NAME="766"></A>hand, Menander and Euthydemus, who were just commencing their new command, 
<A NAME="767"></A>prompted by a feeling of rivalry and emulation of both the generals, were 
<A NAME="768"></A>eager to gain some great success before Demosthenes came, and to prove 
<A NAME="769"></A>themselves superior to Nicias. They urged the honour of the city, which, 
<A NAME="770"></A>said they, would be blemished and utterly lost if they should decline a 
<A NAME="771"></A>challenge from the Syracusans. Thus they forced Nicias to a sea-fight; 
<A NAME="772"></A>and by the stratagem of Ariston, the Corinthian pilot (his trick, described 
<A NAME="773"></A>by Thucydides, about the men's dinners), they were worsted, and lost many 
<A NAME="774"></A>of their men, causing the greatest dejection to Nicias, who had suffered 
<A NAME="775"></A>so much from having the sole command, and now again miscarried through 
<A NAME="776"></A>his colleagues.
<A NAME="777"></A><BR><BR>But now by this time Demosthenes with his splendid fleet came in 
<A NAME="778"></A>sight outside the harbour, a terror to the enemy. He brought along, in 
<A NAME="779"></A>seventy-three galleys, five thousand men-at-arms; of darters, archers, 
<A NAME="780"></A>and slingers, not less than three thousand with the glittering of their 
<A NAME="781"></A>armour, the flags waving from the galleys, the multitude of coxswains and 
<A NAME="782"></A>flute-players giving time to the rowers, setting off the whole with all 
<A NAME="783"></A>possible warlike pomp and ostentation to dismay the enemy. Now one may 
<A NAME="784"></A>believe the Syracusans were again in extreme alarm, seeing no end or prospect 
<A NAME="785"></A>of release before them, toiling, as it seemed, in vain, and perishing to 
<A NAME="786"></A>no purpose. Nicias, however, was not long overjoyed with the reinforcement; 
<A NAME="787"></A>for the first time he conferred with Demosthenes, who advised forthwith 
<A NAME="788"></A>to attack the Syracusans, and to put all to the speediest hazard, to win 
<A NAME="789"></A>Syracuse, or else return home, afraid, and wondering at his promptness 
<A NAME="790"></A>and audacity, he besought him to do nothing rashly and, desperately, since 
<A NAME="791"></A>delay would be the ruin of the enemy, whose money would not hold out, nor 
<A NAME="792"></A>their confederates be long kept together; that when once they came to be 
<A NAME="793"></A>pinched with want, they would presently come again to him for terms, as 
<A NAME="794"></A>formerly. For, indeed, many in Syracuse held secret correspondence with 
<A NAME="795"></A>him, and urged him to stay, declaring that even now the people were quite 
<A NAME="796"></A>worn out with the war and weary of Gylippus. And if their necessities should 
<A NAME="797"></A>the least sharpen upon them they would give up all.
<A NAME="798"></A><BR><BR>Nicias glancing darkly at these matters, and unwilling to speak 
<A NAME="799"></A>out plainly, made his colleagues imagine that it was cowardice which made 
<A NAME="800"></A>him talk in this manner. And saying that this was the old story over again, 
<A NAME="801"></A>the well-known procrastinations and delays and refinements with which at 
<A NAME="802"></A>first he let slip the opportunity in not immediately falling on the enemy, 
<A NAME="803"></A>but suffering the armament to become a thing of yesterday, that nobody 
<A NAME="804"></A>was alarmed with, they took the side of Demosthenes, and with ado forced 
<A NAME="805"></A>Nicias to comply. And so Demosthenes, taking the land-forces, by night 
<A NAME="806"></A>made an assault upon Epipolae; part of the enemy he slew ere they took 
<A NAME="807"></A>the alarm, the rest defending themselves he put to flight. Nor was he content 
<A NAME="808"></A>with this victory there, but pushed on further, till he met the Boeotians. 
<A NAME="809"></A>For these were the first that made head against the Athenians, and charged 
<A NAME="810"></A>them with a shout, spear against spear, and killed many on the place. And 
<A NAME="811"></A>now at once there ensued a panic and confusion throughout the whole army; 
<A NAME="812"></A>the victorious portion got infected with the fears of the flying part, 
<A NAME="813"></A>and those who were still disembarking and coming forward falling foul of 
<A NAME="814"></A>the retreaters, came into conflict with their own party, taking the fugitives 
<A NAME="815"></A>for pursuers, and treating their friends as if they were the 
<A NAME="816"></A>enemy.
<A NAME="817"></A><BR><BR>Thus huddled together in disorder, distracted with fear and uncertainties, 
<A NAME="818"></A>and unable to be sure of seeing anything, the night not being absolutely 
<A NAME="819"></A>dark, nor yielding any steady light, the moon then towards setting, shadowed 
<A NAME="820"></A>with the many weapons and bodies that moved to and fro, and glimmering 
<A NAME="821"></A>so as not to show an object plain, but to make friends through fear suspected 
<A NAME="822"></A>for foes, the Athenians fell into utter perplexity and desperation. For, 
<A NAME="823"></A>moreover, they had the moon at their backs, and consequently their own 
<A NAME="824"></A>shadows fell upon them, and both hid the number and the glittering of their 
<A NAME="825"></A>arms; while the reflection of the moon from the shields of the enemy made 
<A NAME="826"></A>them show more numerous and better appointed than, indeed, they were. At 
<A NAME="827"></A>last, being pressed on every side, when once they had given way, they took 
<A NAME="828"></A>to rout, and in their flight were destroyed, some by the enemy, some by 
<A NAME="829"></A>the hand of their friends, and some tumbling down the rocks, while those 
<A NAME="830"></A>that were dispersed and straggled about were picked off in the morning 
<A NAME="831"></A>by the horsemen and put to the sword. The slain were two thousand; and 
<A NAME="832"></A>of the rest few came off safe with their arms.
<A NAME="833"></A><BR><BR>Upon this disaster, which to him was not wholly an unexpected one, 
<A NAME="834"></A>Nicias accused the rashness of Demosthenes; but he, making his excuses 
<A NAME="835"></A>for the past, now advised to be gone in all haste, for neither were other 
<A NAME="836"></A>forces to come, nor could the enemy be beaten with the present. And, indeed, 
<A NAME="837"></A>even supposing they were yet too hard for the enemy in any case, they ought 
<A NAME="838"></A>to remove and quit a situation which they understood to be always accounted 
<A NAME="839"></A>a sickly one, and dangerous for an army, and was more particularly unwholesome 
<A NAME="840"></A>now, as they could see themselves, because of the time of year. It was 
<A NAME="841"></A>the beginning of autumn, and many now lay sick, and all were out of 
<A NAME="842"></A>heart.
<A NAME="843"></A><BR><BR>It grieved Nicias to hear of flight and departing home, not that 
<A NAME="844"></A>he did not fear the Syracusans, but he was worse afraid of the Athenians, 
<A NAME="845"></A>their impeachments and sentences; he professed that he apprehended no further 
<A NAME="846"></A>harm there, or if it must be, he would rather die by the hand of an enemy 
<A NAME="847"></A>than by his fellow-citizens. He was not of the opinion which Leo of Byzantium 
<A NAME="848"></A>declared to his fellow-citizens: "I had rather," said he, "perish by you, 
<A NAME="849"></A>than with you." As to the matter of place and quarter whither to remove 
<A NAME="850"></A>their camp, that, he said, might be debated at leisure. And Demosthenes, 
<A NAME="851"></A>his former counsel having succeeded so ill, ceased to press him further; 
<A NAME="852"></A>others thought Nicias had reasons for expectation, and relied on some assurance 
<A NAME="853"></A>from people within the city, and that this made him so strongly oppose 
<A NAME="854"></A>their retreat, so they acquiesced. But fresh forces now coming to the Syracusans 
<A NAME="855"></A>and the sickness growing worse in his camp, he, also, now approved of their 
<A NAME="856"></A>retreat, and commanded the soldiers to make ready to go 
<A NAME="857"></A>aboard.
<A NAME="858"></A><BR><BR>And when all were in readiness, and none of the enemy had observed 
<A NAME="859"></A>them, not expecting such a thing, the moon was eclipsed in the night, to 
<A NAME="860"></A>the great fright of Nicias and others, who, for want of experience, or 
<A NAME="861"></A>out of superstition, felt alarm at such appearances. That the sun might 
<A NAME="862"></A>be darkened about the close of the month, this even ordinary people now 
<A NAME="863"></A>understood pretty well to be the effect of the moon; but the moon itself 
<A NAME="864"></A>to be darkened, how that could come about, and how, on the sudden, a broad 
<A NAME="865"></A>full moon should lose her light, and show such various colours, was not 
<A NAME="866"></A>easy to be comprehended; they concluded it to be ominous, and a divine 
<A NAME="867"></A>intimation of some heavy calamities. For he who the first, and the most 
<A NAME="868"></A>plainly of any, and with the greatest assurance committed to writing how 
<A NAME="869"></A>the moon is enlightened and overshadowed, was Anaxagoras; and he was as 
<A NAME="870"></A>yet but recent, nor was his argument much known, but was rather kept secret, 
<A NAME="871"></A>passing only amongst a few, under some kind of caution and confidence. 
<A NAME="872"></A>People would not then tolerate natural philosophers, and theorists, as 
<A NAME="873"></A>they then called them, about things above; as lessening the divine power, 
<A NAME="874"></A>by explaining away its agency into the operation of irrational causes and 
<A NAME="875"></A>senseless forces acting by necessity, without anything of Providence or 
<A NAME="876"></A>a free agent. Hence it was that Protagoras was banished, and Anaxagoras 
<A NAME="877"></A>cast in prison, so that Pericles had much difficulty to procure his liberty; 
<A NAME="878"></A>and Socrates, though he had no concern whatever with this sort of learning, 
<A NAME="879"></A>yet was put to death for philosophy. It was only afterwards that the reputation 
<A NAME="880"></A>of Plato, shining forth by his life, and because he subjected natural necessity 
<A NAME="881"></A>to divine and more excellent principles, took away the obloquy and scandal 
<A NAME="882"></A>that had attached to such contemplations, and obtained these studies currency 
<A NAME="883"></A>among all people. So his friend Dion, when the moon, at the time he was 
<A NAME="884"></A>to embark from Zacynthus to go against Dionysius, was eclipsed, was not 
<A NAME="885"></A>in the least disturbed, but went on, and arriving at Syracuse, expelled 
<A NAME="886"></A>the tyrant. But it so fell out with Nicias, that he had not at this time 
<A NAME="887"></A>a skilful diviner with him; his former habitual adviser who used to moderate 
<A NAME="888"></A>much of his superstition, Stilbides, had died a little before. For, in 
<A NAME="889"></A>fact, this prodigy, as Philochorus observes, was not unlucky for men wishing 
<A NAME="890"></A>to fly, but on the contrary very favourable; for things done in fear require 
<A NAME="891"></A>to be hidden, and the light is their foe. Nor was it usual to observe signs 
<A NAME="892"></A>in the sun or moon more than three days, as Autoclides states in his Commentaries. 
<A NAME="893"></A>But Nicias persuaded them to wait another full course of the moon, as if 
<A NAME="894"></A>he had not seen it clear again as soon as ever it had passed the region 
<A NAME="895"></A>of shadow where the light was obstructed by the earth.
<A NAME="896"></A><BR><BR>In a manner abandoning all other cares, he betook himself wholly 
<A NAME="897"></A>to his sacrifices, till the enemy came upon them with their infantry, besieging 
<A NAME="898"></A>the forts and camp, and placing their ships in a circle about the harbour. 
<A NAME="899"></A>Nor did the men in the galleys only, but the little boys everywhere got 
<A NAME="900"></A>into the fishing-boats and rowed up and challenged the Athenians, and insulted 
<A NAME="901"></A>over them. Amongst these a youth of noble parentage, Heraclides by name, 
<A NAME="902"></A>having ventured out beyond the rest, an Athenian ship pursued and well-nigh 
<A NAME="903"></A>took him. His uncle Pollichus, in fear for him, put out with ten galleys 
<A NAME="904"></A>which he commanded, and the rest, to relieve Pollichus, in like manner 
<A NAME="905"></A>drew forth; the result of it being a very sharp engagement, in which the 
<A NAME="906"></A>Syracusans had the victory, and slew Eurymedon, with many others. After 
<A NAME="907"></A>this the Athenian soldiers had no patience to stay longer, but raised an 
<A NAME="908"></A>outcry against their officers, requiring them to depart by land; for the 
<A NAME="909"></A>Syracusans, upon their victory, immediately shut and blocked up the entrance 
<A NAME="910"></A>of the harbour; but Nicias would not consent to this, as it was a shameful 
<A NAME="911"></A>thing to leave behind so many ships of burden, and galleys little less 
<A NAME="912"></A>than two hundred. Putting, therefore, on board the best of the foot, and 
<A NAME="913"></A>the most serviceable darters, they filled one hundred and ten galleys; 
<A NAME="914"></A>the rest wanted oars. The remainder of his army Nicias posted along by 
<A NAME="915"></A>the seaside, abandoning the great camp and the fortifications adjoining 
<A NAME="916"></A>the temple of Hercules; so the Syracusans, not having for a long time performed 
<A NAME="917"></A>their usual sacrifice to Hercules, went up now, both priests and captains, 
<A NAME="918"></A>to sacrifice.
<A NAME="919"></A><BR><BR>And their galleys being manned, the diviners predicted from their 
<A NAME="920"></A>sacrifices victory and glory to the Syracusans, provided they would not 
<A NAME="921"></A>be the aggressors, but fight upon the defensive; for so Hercules overcame 
<A NAME="922"></A>all, by only defending himself when set upon. In this confidence they set 
<A NAME="923"></A>out; and this proved the hottest and fiercest of all their sea-fights, 
<A NAME="924"></A>raising no less concern and passion in the beholders than in the actors; 
<A NAME="925"></A>as they could oversee the whole action with all the various and unexpected 
<A NAME="926"></A>turns of fortune which, in a short space, occurred in it; the Athenians 
<A NAME="927"></A>suffering no less from their own preparations, than from the enemy; for 
<A NAME="928"></A>they fought against light and nimble ships, that could attack from any 
<A NAME="929"></A>quarter, with theirs laden and heavy. And they were thrown at with stones 
<A NAME="930"></A>that fly indifferently any way, for which they could only return darts 
<A NAME="931"></A>and arrows, the direct aim of which the motion of the water disturbed, 
<A NAME="932"></A>preventing their coming true, point foremost to their mark. This the Syracusans 
<A NAME="933"></A>had learned from Ariston the Corinthian pilot, who, fighting stoutly, fell 
<A NAME="934"></A>himself in this very engagement, when the victory had already declared 
<A NAME="935"></A>for the Syracusans.
<A NAME="936"></A><BR><BR>The Athenians, their loss and slaughter being very great, their 
<A NAME="937"></A>flight by sea cut off, their safety by land so difficult, did not attempt 
<A NAME="938"></A>to hinder the enemy towing away their ships, under their eyes, nor demanded 
<A NAME="939"></A>their dead, as, indeed, their want of burial seemed a less calamity than 
<A NAME="940"></A>the leaving behind the sick and wounded which they now had before them. 
<A NAME="941"></A>Yet more miserable still than those did they reckon themselves, who were 
<A NAME="942"></A>to work on yet, through more such sufferings, after all to reach the same 
<A NAME="943"></A>end.
<A NAME="944"></A><BR><BR>They prepared to dislodge that night. And Gylippus and his friends 
<A NAME="945"></A>seeing the Syracusans engaged in their sacrifices and at their cups, for 
<A NAME="946"></A>their victories, and it being also a holiday, did not expect either by 
<A NAME="947"></A>persuasion or by force to rouse them up and carry them against the Athenians 
<A NAME="948"></A>as they decamped. But Hermocrates, of his own head, put a trick upon Nicias, 
<A NAME="949"></A>and sent some of his companions to him, who pretended they came from those 
<A NAME="950"></A>that were wont to hold secret intelligence with him, and advised him not 
<A NAME="951"></A>to stir that night, the Syracusans having laid ambushes and beset the ways. 
<A NAME="952"></A>Nicias, caught with this stratagem, remained, to encounter presently in 
<A NAME="953"></A>reality what he had feared when there was no occasion. For they, the next 
<A NAME="954"></A>morning, marching before, seized the defiles, fortified the passes where 
<A NAME="955"></A>the rivers were fordable, cut down the bridges, and ordered their horsemen 
<A NAME="956"></A>to range the plains and ground that lay open, so as to leave no part of 
<A NAME="957"></A>the country where the Athenians could move without fighting. They stayed 
<A NAME="958"></A>both that day and another night, and then went along as if they were leaving 
<A NAME="959"></A>their own, not an enemy's country, lamenting and bewailing for want of 
<A NAME="960"></A>necessaries, and for their parting from friends and companions that were 
<A NAME="961"></A>not able to help themselves; and, nevertheless, judging the present evils 
<A NAME="962"></A>lighter than those they expected to come. But among the many miserable 
<A NAME="963"></A>spectacles that appeared up and down in the camp, the saddest sight of 
<A NAME="964"></A>all was Nicias himself, labouring under his malady, and unworthily reduced 
<A NAME="965"></A>to the scantiest supply of all the accommodations necessary for human wants, 
<A NAME="966"></A>of which he in his condition required more than ordinary, because of his 
<A NAME="967"></A>sickness, yet bearing up under all this illness, and doing and undergoing 
<A NAME="968"></A>more than many in perfect health. And it was plainly evident that all this 
<A NAME="969"></A>toil was not for himself, or from any regard to his own life, but that 
<A NAME="970"></A>purely for the sake of those under his command he would not abandon hope. 
<A NAME="971"></A>And, indeed, the rest were given over to weeping and lamentation through 
<A NAME="972"></A>fear or sorrow, but he, whenever he yielded to anything of the kind, did 
<A NAME="973"></A>so, it was evident, from reflection upon the shame and dishonour of the 
<A NAME="974"></A>enterprise, contrasted with the greatness and glory of the success he had 
<A NAME="975"></A>anticipated, and not only the sight of his person, but, also, the recollection 
<A NAME="976"></A>of the arguments and the dissuasions he used to prevent this expedition 
<A NAME="977"></A>enhanced their sense of the undeservedness of his sufferings, nor had they 
<A NAME="978"></A>any heart to put their trust in the gods, considering that a man so religious, 
<A NAME="979"></A>who had performed to the divine powers so many and so great acts of devotion, 
<A NAME="980"></A>should have no more favourable treatment than the wickedest and meanest 
<A NAME="981"></A>of the army.
<A NAME="982"></A><BR><BR>Nicias, however, endeavoured all the while by his voice, his countenance, 
<A NAME="983"></A>and his carriage, to show himself undefeated by these misfortunes. And 
<A NAME="984"></A>all along the way shot at, and receiving wounds eight days continually 
<A NAME="985"></A>from the enemy, he yet preserved the forces with him in a body entire, 
<A NAME="986"></A>till that Demosthenes was taken prisoner with the party that he led, whilst 
<A NAME="987"></A>they fought and made a resistance, and so got behind and were surrounded 
<A NAME="988"></A>near the country house of Polyzelus. Demosthenes thereupon drew his sword, 
<A NAME="989"></A>and wounded but did not kill himself, the enemy speedily running in and 
<A NAME="990"></A>seizing upon him. So soon as the Syracusans had gone and informed Nicias 
<A NAME="991"></A>of this, and he had sent some horsemen, and by them knew the certainty 
<A NAME="992"></A>of the defeat of that division, he then vouchsafed to sue to Gylippus for 
<A NAME="993"></A>a truce for the Athenians to depart out of Sicily, leaving hostages for 
<A NAME="994"></A>payment of money that the Syracusans had expended in the 
<A NAME="995"></A>war.
<A NAME="996"></A><BR><BR>But now they would not hear of these proposals, but threatening 
<A NAME="997"></A>and reviling them, angrily and insultingly continued to ply their missiles 
<A NAME="998"></A>at them, now destitute of every necessary. Yet Nicias still made good his 
<A NAME="999"></A>retreat all that night, and the next day, through all their darts, made 
<A NAME="1000"></A>his way to the river Asinarus. There, however, the enemy encountering them, 
<A NAME="1001"></A>drove some into the stream, while others, ready to die for thirst, plunged 
<A NAME="1002"></A>in headlong, while they drank at the same time, and were cut down by their 
<A NAME="1003"></A>enemies. And here was the cruellest and the most immoderate slaughter. 
<A NAME="1004"></A>Till at last Nicias falling down to Gylippus, "Let pity, O Gylippus," said 
<A NAME="1005"></A>he, "move you in your victory; not for me, who was destined, it seems, 
<A NAME="1006"></A>to bring the glory I once had to this end but for the other Athenians; 
<A NAME="1007"></A>as you well know that the chances of war are common to all, and the Athenians 
<A NAME="1008"></A>used them moderately and mildly towards you in their 
<A NAME="1009"></A>prosperity."
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR><BR>At these words, and at the sight of Nicias, Gylippus was somewhat 
<A NAME="1011"></A>troubled, for he was sensible that the Lacedaemonians had received good 
<A NAME="1012"></A>offices from Nicias in the late treaty, and he thought it would be a great 
<A NAME="1013"></A>and glorious thing for him to carry off the chief commanders of the Athenians 
<A NAME="1014"></A>alive. He therefore raised Nicias with respect, and bade him be of good 
<A NAME="1015"></A>cheer, and commanded his men to spare the lives of the rest. But the word 
<A NAME="1016"></A>of command being communicated slowly, the slain were a far greater number 
<A NAME="1017"></A>than the prisoners. Many, however, were privately conveyed away by particular 
<A NAME="1018"></A>soldiers. Those taken openly were hurried together in a mass; their arms 
<A NAME="1019"></A>and spoils hung up on the finest and largest trees along the river. The 
<A NAME="1020"></A>conquerors, with garlands on their heads, with their own horses splendidly 
<A NAME="1021"></A>adorned, and cropping short the manes and tails of those of their enemies, 
<A NAME="1022"></A>entered the city, having, in the most signal conflict ever waged by Greeks 
<A NAME="1023"></A>against Greeks, and with the greatest strength and the utmost effort of 
<A NAME="1024"></A>valour and manhood won a most entire victory.
<A NAME="1025"></A><BR><BR>And a general assembly of the people of Syracuse and their confederates 
<A NAME="1026"></A>sitting, Eurycles, the popular leader, moved, first, that the day on which 
<A NAME="1027"></A>they took Nicias should from thenceforward be kept holiday by sacrificing 
<A NAME="1028"></A>and forbearing all manner of work, and from the river he called the Asinarian 
<A NAME="1029"></A>Feast. This was the twenty-sixth day of the month Carneus, the Athenian 
<A NAME="1030"></A>Metagitnion. And that the servants of the Athenians with the other confederates 
<A NAME="1031"></A>be sold for slaves, and they themselves and the Sicilian auxiliaries be 
<A NAME="1032"></A>kept and employed in the quarries, except the generals, who should be put 
<A NAME="1033"></A>to death. The Syracusans favoured the proposals, and when Hermocrates said, 
<A NAME="1034"></A>that to use well a victory was better than to gain a victory, he was met 
<A NAME="1035"></A>with great clamour and outcry. When Gylippus, also, demanded the Athenian 
<A NAME="1036"></A>generals to be delivered to him, that he might carry them to the Lacedaemonians, 
<A NAME="1037"></A>the Syracusans, now insolent with their good-fortune, gave him ill words. 
<A NAME="1038"></A>Indeed, before this, even in the war, they had been impatient at his rough 
<A NAME="1039"></A>behaviour and Lacedaemonian haughtiness, and had, as Timaeus tells us, 
<A NAME="1040"></A>discovered sordidness and avarice in his character, vices which may have 
<A NAME="1041"></A>descended to him from his father Cleandrides, who was convicted of bribery 
<A NAME="1042"></A>and banished. And the very man himself, of the one thousand talents which 
<A NAME="1043"></A>Lysander sent to Sparta, embezzled thirty, and hid them under the tiles 
<A NAME="1044"></A>of his house, and was detected and shamefully fled his country. But this 
<A NAME="1045"></A>is related more at large in the life of Lysander. Timaeus says that Demosthenes 
<A NAME="1046"></A>and Nicias did not die, as Thucydides and Philistus have written, by the 
<A NAME="1047"></A>order of the Syracusans, but that upon a message sent them from Hermocrates, 
<A NAME="1048"></A>whilst yet the assembly were sitting, by the connivance of some of their 
<A NAME="1049"></A>guards, they were enabled to put an end to themselves. Their bodies, however, 
<A NAME="1050"></A>were thrown out before the gates and offered for a public spectacle. And 
<A NAME="1051"></A>I have heard that to this day in a temple at Syracuse is shown a shield, 
<A NAME="1052"></A>said to have been Nicias's, curiously wrought and embroidered with gold 
<A NAME="1053"></A>and purple intermixed. Most of the Athenians perished in the quarries by 
<A NAME="1054"></A>diseases and ill diet, being allowed only one pint of barley every day, 
<A NAME="1055"></A>and one half pint of water. Many of them, however, were carried off by 
<A NAME="1056"></A>stealth, or, from the first, were supposed to be servants, and were sold 
<A NAME="1057"></A>as slaves. These latter were branded on their foreheads with the figure 
<A NAME="1058"></A>of a horse. There were, however, Athenians who, in addition to slavery, 
<A NAME="1059"></A>had to endure even this. But their discreet and orderly conduct was an 
<A NAME="1060"></A>advantage to them; they were either soon set free, or won the respect of 
<A NAME="1061"></A>their masters with whom they continued to live. Several were saved for 
<A NAME="1062"></A>the sake of Euripides, whose poetry, it appears, was in request among the 
<A NAME="1063"></A>Sicilians more than among any of the settlers out of Greece. And when any 
<A NAME="1064"></A>travellers arrived that could tell them some passage, or give them any 
<A NAME="1065"></A>specimen of his verses, they were delighted to be able to communicate them 
<A NAME="1066"></A>to one another. Many of the captives who got safe back to Athens are said, 
<A NAME="1067"></A>after they reached home, to have gone and made their acknowledgments to 
<A NAME="1068"></A>Euripides, relating how that some of them had been released from their 
<A NAME="1069"></A>slavery by teaching what they could remember of his poems, and others, 
<A NAME="1070"></A>when straggling after the fight, been relieved with meat and drink for 
<A NAME="1071"></A>repeating some of his lyrics. Nor need this be any wonder, for it is told 
<A NAME="1072"></A>that a ship of Caunus fleeing into one of their harbours for protection, 
<A NAME="1073"></A>pursued by pirates, was not received, but forced back, till one asked if 
<A NAME="1074"></A>they knew any of Euripides's verses, and on their saying they did, they 
<A NAME="1075"></A>were admitted, and their ship brought into harbour.
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR><BR>It is said that the Athenians would not believe their loss, in 
<A NAME="1077"></A>a great degree because of the person who first brought them news of it. 
<A NAME="1078"></A>For a certain stranger, it seems, coming to Piraeus, and there sitting 
<A NAME="1079"></A>in a barber's shop, began to talk of what had happened, as if the Athenians 
<A NAME="1080"></A>already knew all that had passed; which the barber hearing, before he acquainted 
<A NAME="1081"></A>anybody else, ran as fast as he could up into the city, addressed himself 
<A NAME="1082"></A>to the Archons, and presently spread it about in the public Place. On which, 
<A NAME="1083"></A>there being everywhere, as may be imagined, terror and consternation, the 
<A NAME="1084"></A>Archons summoned a general assembly, and there brought in the man and questioned 
<A NAME="1085"></A>him how he came to know. And he, giving no satisfactory account, was taken 
<A NAME="1086"></A>for a spreader of false intelligence and a disturber of the city, and was, 
<A NAME="1087"></A>therefore, fastened to the wheel and racked a long time, till other messengers 
<A NAME="1088"></A>arrived that related the whole disaster particularly. So hardly was Nicias 
<A NAME="1089"></A>believed to have suffered the calamity which he had often 
<A NAME="1090"></A>predicted.
