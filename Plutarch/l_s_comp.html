<A NAME="1"></A><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>The Comparison of Lysander with Sylla</B></FONT>
<A NAME="2"></A><BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Having completed this Life also, come we now to the comparison. That which 
<A NAME="11"></A>was common to them both was that they were founders of their own greatness, 
<A NAME="12"></A>with this difference, that Lysander had the consent of his fellow-citizens, 
<A NAME="13"></A>in times of sober judgment, for the honours he received; nor did he force 
<A NAME="14"></A>anything from them against their good-will, nor hold any power contrary 
<A NAME="15"></A>to the laws.
<A NAME="16"></A><BR><BR>"In civil strife e'en villains rise to fame." And so then at Rome, 
<A NAME="17"></A>when the people were distempered, and the government out of order, one 
<A NAME="18"></A>or other was still raised to despotic power; no wonder, then, if Sylla 
<A NAME="19"></A>reigned, when the Glauciae and Saturnini drove out the Metelli, when sons 
<A NAME="20"></A>of consuls were slain in the assemblies, when silver and gold purchased 
<A NAME="21"></A>men and arms, and fire and sword enacted new laws and put down lawful opposition. 
<A NAME="22"></A>Nor do I blame any one, in such circumstances, for working himself into 
<A NAME="23"></A>supreme power, only I would not have it thought a sign of great goodness 
<A NAME="24"></A>to be head of a state so wretchedly discomposed. Lysander, being employed 
<A NAME="25"></A>in the greatest commands and affairs of state, by a sober and well-governed 
<A NAME="26"></A>city, may be said to have had repute as the best and most virtuous man, 
<A NAME="27"></A>in the best and most virtuous commonwealth. And thus, often returning the 
<A NAME="28"></A>government into the hands of the citizens, he received it again as often, 
<A NAME="29"></A>the superiority of his merit still awarding him the first place. Sylla, 
<A NAME="30"></A>on the other hand, when he had once made himself general of an army, kept 
<A NAME="31"></A>his command for ten years together, creating himself sometimes consul, 
<A NAME="32"></A>sometimes proconsul, and sometimes dictator, but always remaining a 
<A NAME="33"></A>tyrant.
<A NAME="34"></A><BR><BR>It is true Lysander, as was said, designed to introduce a new form 
<A NAME="35"></A>of government; by milder methods, however, and more agreeable to law than 
<A NAME="36"></A>Sylla, not by force of arms, but persuasion, nor by subverting the whole 
<A NAME="37"></A>state at once, but simply by amending the succession of the kings; in a 
<A NAME="38"></A>way, moreover, which seemed the naturally just one, that the most deserving 
<A NAME="39"></A>should rule, especially in a city which itself exercised command in Greece, 
<A NAME="40"></A>upon account of virtue, not nobility. For as the hunter considers the whelp 
<A NAME="41"></A>itself, not the bitch, and the horsedealer the foal, not the mare (for 
<A NAME="42"></A>what if the foal should prove a mule?), so likewise were that politician 
<A NAME="43"></A>extremely out, who, in the choice of a chief magistrate, should inquire, 
<A NAME="44"></A>not what the man is, but how descended. The very Spartans themselves have 
<A NAME="45"></A>deposed several of their kings for want of kingly virtues, as degenerated 
<A NAME="46"></A>and good for nothing. As a vicious nature, though of an ancient stock, 
<A NAME="47"></A>is dishonourable, it must be virtue itself, and not birth, that makes virtue 
<A NAME="48"></A>honourable. Furthermore, the one committed his acts of injustice for the 
<A NAME="49"></A>sake of his friends; the other extended his to his friends themselves. 
<A NAME="50"></A>It is confessed on all hands, that Lysander offended most commonly for 
<A NAME="51"></A>the sake of his companions, committing several slaughters to uphold their 
<A NAME="52"></A>power and dominion; but as for Sylla, he, out of envy, reduced Pompey's 
<A NAME="53"></A>command by land and Dolabella's by sea, although he himself had given them 
<A NAME="54"></A>those places; and ordered Lucretius Ofella, who sued for the consulship 
<A NAME="55"></A>as the reward of many great services, to be slain before his eyes, exciting 
<A NAME="56"></A>horror and alarm in the minds of all men, by his cruelty to his dearest 
<A NAME="57"></A>friends.
<A NAME="58"></A><BR><BR>As regards the pursuit of riches and pleasures, we yet further 
<A NAME="59"></A>discover in one a princely, in the other a tyrannical, disposition. Lysander 
<A NAME="60"></A>did nothing that was intemperate or licentious, in that full command of 
<A NAME="61"></A>means and opportunity, but kept clear, as much as ever man did, of that 
<A NAME="62"></A>trite saying-
<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR>"Lions at home, but foxes out of doors;" and ever maintained a 
<A NAME="64"></A>sober, truly Spartan, and well-disciplined course of conduct. Whereas Sylla 
<A NAME="65"></A>could never moderate his unruly affections, either by poverty when young, 
<A NAME="66"></A>or by years when grown old, but would be still prescribing laws to the 
<A NAME="67"></A>citizens concerning chastity and sobriety, himself living all that time, 
<A NAME="68"></A>as Sallust affirms, in lewdness and adultery. By these ways he so improverished 
<A NAME="69"></A>and drained the city of her treasures, as to be forced to sell privileges 
<A NAME="70"></A>and immunities to allied and friendly cities for money, although he daily 
<A NAME="71"></A>gave up the wealthiest and the greatest families to public sale and confiscation. 
<A NAME="72"></A>There was no end of his favours vainly spent and thrown away on flatterers; 
<A NAME="73"></A>for what hope could there be, or what likelihood of forethought or economy, 
<A NAME="74"></A>in his more private moments over wine, when, in the open face of the people, 
<A NAME="75"></A>upon the auction of a large estate, which he would have passed over to 
<A NAME="76"></A>one of his friends at a small price, because another bid higher, and the 
<A NAME="77"></A>officer announced the advance, he broke out into a passion, saying: "What 
<A NAME="78"></A>a strange and unjust thing is this, O citizens, that I cannot dispose of 
<A NAME="79"></A>my own booty as I please!" But Lysander, on the contrary, with the rest 
<A NAME="80"></A>of the spoil, sent home for public use even the presents which were made 
<A NAME="81"></A>him. Nor do I comment him for it, for he, perhaps, by excessive liberality, 
<A NAME="82"></A>did Sparta more harm than ever the other did Rome by rapine; I only use 
<A NAME="83"></A>it as an argument of his indifference to riches. They exercised a strange 
<A NAME="84"></A>influence on their respective cities. Sylla, a profuse debauchee, endeavoured 
<A NAME="85"></A>to restore sober living amongst the citizens; Lysander, temperate himself, 
<A NAME="86"></A>filled Sparta with the luxury he disregarded. So that both were blameworthy, 
<A NAME="87"></A>the one for raising himself above his own laws, the other for causing his 
<A NAME="88"></A>fellow-citizens to fall beneath his own example. He taught Sparta to want 
<A NAME="89"></A>the very things which he himself had learned to do without. And thus much 
<A NAME="90"></A>of their civil administration.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR>As for feats of arms, wise conduct in war, innumerable victories, 
<A NAME="92"></A>perilous adventures, Sylla was beyond compare. Lysander, indeed, came off 
<A NAME="93"></A>twice victorious in two battles by sea; I shall add to that the siege of 
<A NAME="94"></A>Athens, a work of greater fame than difficulty. What occurred in Boeotia, 
<A NAME="95"></A>and at Haliartus, was the result, perhaps, of ill fortune; yet it certainly 
<A NAME="96"></A>looks like ill counsel, not to wait for the king's forces, which had all 
<A NAME="97"></A>but arrived from Plataea, but out of ambition and eagerness to fight, to 
<A NAME="98"></A>approach the walls at disadvantage, and so to be cut off by a sally of 
<A NAME="99"></A>inconsiderable men. He received his death-wound, not as Cleombrotus, at 
<A NAME="100"></A>Leuctra, resisting manfully the assault of an enemy in the field; not as 
<A NAME="101"></A>Cyrus or Epaminondas, sustaining the declining battle, or making sure the 
<A NAME="102"></A>victory; all these died the death of kings and generals; but he, as it 
<A NAME="103"></A>had been some common skirmisher or scout, cast away his life ingloriously, 
<A NAME="104"></A>giving testimony to the wisdom of the ancient Spartan maxim, to avoid attacks 
<A NAME="105"></A>on walled cities, in which the stoutest warrior may chance to fall by the 
<A NAME="106"></A>hand, not only of a man utterly his inferior, but by that of a boy or woman, 
<A NAME="107"></A>as Achilles, they say, was slain by Paris in the gates. As for Sylla, it 
<A NAME="108"></A>were hard to reckon up how many set battles he won, or how many thousand 
<A NAME="109"></A>he slew; he took Rome itself twice, as also the Athenian Piraeus, not by 
<A NAME="110"></A>famine, as Lysander did, but by a series of great battles, driving Archelaus 
<A NAME="111"></A>into the sea. And what is most important, there was a vast difference between 
<A NAME="112"></A>the commanders they had to deal with. For I look upon it as an easy task, 
<A NAME="113"></A>or rather sport, to beat Antiochus, Alcibiades's pilot, or to circumvent 
<A NAME="114"></A>Philocles, the Athenian demagogue-
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR>"Sharp only at the inglorious point of tongue," whom Mithridates 
<A NAME="116"></A>would have scorned to compare with his groom, or Marius with his lictor. 
<A NAME="117"></A>But of the potentates, consuls, commanders, and demagogues, to pass by 
<A NAME="118"></A>all the rest who opposed themselves to Sylla, who amongst the Romans so 
<A NAME="119"></A>formidable as Marius, what king more powerful than Mithridates? who of 
<A NAME="120"></A>the Italians more warlike than Lamponius and Telesinus? yet of these, one 
<A NAME="121"></A>he drove into banishment, one he quelled, and the others he 
<A NAME="122"></A>slew.
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>And what is more important, in my judgment, than anything yet adduced, 
<A NAME="124"></A>is that Lysander had the assistance of the state in all his achievements; 
<A NAME="125"></A>whereas Sylla, besides that he was a banished person, and overpowered by 
<A NAME="126"></A>a faction, at a time when his wife was driven from home, his houses demolished, 
<A NAME="127"></A>adherents slain, himself then in Boeotia, stood embattled against countless 
<A NAME="128"></A>numbers of the public enemy, and, endangering himself for the sake of his 
<A NAME="129"></A>country, raised a trophy of victory; and not even when Mithridates came 
<A NAME="130"></A>with proposals of alliance and aid against his enemies would he show any 
<A NAME="131"></A>sort of compliance, or even clemency; did not so much as address him, or 
<A NAME="132"></A>vouchsafe him his hand, until he had it from the king's own mouth that 
<A NAME="133"></A>he was willing to quit Asia, surrender the navy, and restore Bithynia and 
<A NAME="134"></A>Cappadocia to the two kings. Than which action Sylla never performed a 
<A NAME="135"></A>braver, or with a nobler spirit, when preferring the public good to the 
<A NAME="136"></A>private, and like good hounds, where he had once fixed, never letting go 
<A NAME="137"></A>his hold, till the enemy yielded, then, and not until then, he set himself 
<A NAME="138"></A>to revenge his own private quarrels. We may perhaps let ourselves be influenced, 
<A NAME="139"></A>moreover, in our comparison of their characters, by considering their treatment 
<A NAME="140"></A>of Athens. Sylla, when he had made himself master of the city, which then 
<A NAME="141"></A>upheld the dominion and power of Mithridates in opposition to him, restored 
<A NAME="142"></A>her to liberty and the free exercise of her own laws; Lysander, on the 
<A NAME="143"></A>contrary, when she had fallen from a vast height of dignity and rule, showed 
<A NAME="144"></A>her no compassion, but abolishing her democratic government, imposed on 
<A NAME="145"></A>her the most cruel and lawless tyrants. We are now qualified to consider 
<A NAME="146"></A>whether we should go far from the truth or no in pronouncing that Sylla 
<A NAME="147"></A>performed the more glorious deeds, but Lysander committed the fewer faults, 
<A NAME="148"></A>as, likewise, by giving to one the pre-eminence for moderation and self-control, 
<A NAME="149"></A>to the other for conduct and valour.
