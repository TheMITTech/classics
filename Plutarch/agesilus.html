<A NAME="2"></A>
<BR>(died 401 B.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Archidamus, the son of Zeuxidamus, having reigned gloriously over the Lacedaemonians, 
<A NAME="11"></A>left behind him two sons, Agis the elder, begotten of Lampido, a noble 
<A NAME="12"></A>lady, Agesilaus, much the younger, born of Eupolia, the daughter of Melesippidas. 
<A NAME="13"></A>Now the succession belonging to Agis by law, Agesilaus, who in all probability 
<A NAME="14"></A>was to be but a private man, was educated according to the usual discipline 
<A NAME="15"></A>of the country, hard and severe, and meant to teach young men to obey their 
<A NAME="16"></A>superiors. Whence it was that, men say, Simonides called Sparta "the tamer 
<A NAME="17"></A>of men," because by early strictness of education they, more than any nation, 
<A NAME="18"></A>trained the citizens to obedience to the laws, and made them tractable 
<A NAME="19"></A>and patient of subjection, as horses that are broken in while colts. The 
<A NAME="20"></A>law did not impose this harsh rule on the heirs apparent of the kingdom. 
<A NAME="21"></A>But Agesilaus, whose good fortune it was to be born a younger brother, 
<A NAME="22"></A>was consequently bred to all the arts of obedience, and so the better fitted 
<A NAME="23"></A>for the government, when it fell to his share; hence it was that he proved 
<A NAME="24"></A>the most popular-tempered of the Spartan kings, his early life having added 
<A NAME="25"></A>to his natural kingly and commanding qualities the gentle and humane feelings 
<A NAME="26"></A>of a citizen.
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR>While he was yet a boy, bred up in one of what are called the flocks, 
<A NAME="28"></A>or classes, he attracted the attachment of Lysander, who was particularly 
<A NAME="29"></A>struck with the orderly temper that he manifested. For though he was one 
<A NAME="30"></A>of the highest spirits, emulous above any of his companions, ambitious 
<A NAME="31"></A>of pre-eminence in everything, and showed an impetuosity and fervour of 
<A NAME="32"></A>mind which irresistibly carried him through all opposition or difficulty 
<A NAME="33"></A>he could meet with; yet, on the other side, he was so easy and gentle in 
<A NAME="34"></A>his nature, and so apt to yield to authority, that though he would do nothing 
<A NAME="35"></A>on compulsion, upon ingenuous motives he would obey any commands, and was 
<A NAME="36"></A>more hurt by the least rebuke or disgrace than he was distressed by any 
<A NAME="37"></A>toil or hardship.
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR>He had one leg shorter than the other, but this deformity was little 
<A NAME="39"></A>observed in the general beauty of his person in youth. And the easy way 
<A NAME="40"></A>in which he bore (he being the first always to pass a jest upon himself) 
<A NAME="41"></A>went far to make it disregarded. And indeed his high spirit and eagerness 
<A NAME="42"></A>to distinguish himself were all the more conspicuous by it, since he never 
<A NAME="43"></A>let his lameness withhold him from any toil or any brave action. Neither 
<A NAME="44"></A>his statue nor picture are extant, he never allowing them in his life, 
<A NAME="45"></A>and utterly forbidding them to be made after his death. He is said to have 
<A NAME="46"></A>been a little man, of a contemptible presence; but the goodness of his 
<A NAME="47"></A>humour, and his constant cheerfulness and playfulness of temper, always 
<A NAME="48"></A>free from anything of moroseness or haughtiness, made him more attractive, 
<A NAME="49"></A>even to his old age, than the most beautiful and youthful men of the nation. 
<A NAME="50"></A>Theophrastus writes that the Ephors laid a fine upon Archidamus for marrying 
<A NAME="51"></A>a little wife, "For," said they, "she will bring us a race of kinglets, 
<A NAME="52"></A>instead of kings."
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR>Whilst Agis, the elder brother, reigned, Alcibiades, being then 
<A NAME="54"></A>an exile from Athens, came from Sicily to Sparta; nor had he stayed long 
<A NAME="55"></A>there before his familiarity with Timaea, the king's wife, grew suspected, 
<A NAME="56"></A>insomuch that Agis refused to own a child of hers, which, he said, was 
<A NAME="57"></A>Alcibiades's, not his. Nor, if we may believe Duris, the historian, was 
<A NAME="58"></A>Timaea much concerned at it, being herself forward enough to whisper among 
<A NAME="59"></A>her helot maid-servants that the infant's true name was Alcibiades, not 
<A NAME="60"></A>Leotychides. Meanwhile it was believed that the amour he had with her was 
<A NAME="61"></A>not the effect of his love but of his ambition, that he might have Spartan 
<A NAME="62"></A>kings of his posterity. This affair being grown public, it became needful 
<A NAME="63"></A>for Alcibiades to withdraw from Sparta. But the child Leotychides had not 
<A NAME="64"></A>the honours due to a legitimate son paid him, nor was he ever owned by 
<A NAME="65"></A>Agis, till by his prayers and tears he prevailed with him to declare him 
<A NAME="66"></A>his son before several witnesses upon his deathbed. But this did not avail 
<A NAME="67"></A>to fix him in the throne of Agis, after whose death Lysander, who had lately 
<A NAME="68"></A>achieved his conquest of Athens by sea, and was of the greatest power in 
<A NAME="69"></A>Sparta, promoted Agesilaus, urging Leotychides's bastardy as a bar to his 
<A NAME="70"></A>pretensions. Many of the other citizens, also, were favourable to Agesilaus, 
<A NAME="71"></A>and zealously joined his party, induced by the opinion they had of his 
<A NAME="72"></A>merits, of which they themselves had been spectators, in the time that 
<A NAME="73"></A>he had been bred up among them. But there was a man, named Diopithes, at 
<A NAME="74"></A>Sparta, who had a great knowledge of ancient oracles, and was thought particularly 
<A NAME="75"></A>skilful and clever in all points of religion and divination. He alleged, 
<A NAME="76"></A>that it was unlawful to make a lame man king of Lacedaemon, citing in the 
<A NAME="77"></A>debate the following oracle:-
<A NAME="78"></A><BR><BR>"Beware, great Sparta, lest there come of thee,
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>Though sound thyself, an halting sovereignty:
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>Troubles, both long and unexpected too,
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>And storms of deadly warfare shall ensue." But Lysander was not wanting 
<A NAME="82"></A>with an evasion, alleging that if the Spartans were really apprehensive 
<A NAME="83"></A>of the oracle, they must have a care of Leotychides; for it was not the 
<A NAME="84"></A>limping foot of a king that the gods cared about, but the purity of the 
<A NAME="85"></A>Herculean family, into whose rights, if a spurious issue were admitted, 
<A NAME="86"></A>it would make the kingdom to halt indeed, Agesilaus likewise alleged that 
<A NAME="87"></A>the bastardy of Leotychides was witnessed to by Neptune, who threw Agis 
<A NAME="88"></A>out of bed by a violent earthquake, after which time he ceased to visit 
<A NAME="89"></A>his wife, yet Leotychides was born above ten months after 
<A NAME="90"></A>this.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR>Agesilaus was upon these allegations declared king, and soon possessed 
<A NAME="92"></A>himself of the private estate of Agis, as well as his throne, Leotychides 
<A NAME="93"></A>being wholly rejected as a bastard. He now turned his attention to his 
<A NAME="94"></A>kindred by the mother's side, persons of worth and virtue, but miserably 
<A NAME="95"></A>poor. To them he gave half his brother's estate, and by this popular act 
<A NAME="96"></A>gained general good-will and reputation, in the place of the envy and ill-feeling 
<A NAME="97"></A>which the inheritance might otherwise have procured him. What Xenophon 
<A NAME="98"></A>tells us of him, that by complying with, and, as it were, being ruled by 
<A NAME="99"></A>his country, he grew into such great power with them, that he could do 
<A NAME="100"></A>what he pleased, is meant to apply to the power he gained in the following 
<A NAME="101"></A>manner with the Ephors and Elders. These were at that time of the greatest 
<A NAME="102"></A>authority in the state; the former, officers annually chosen; the Elders, 
<A NAME="103"></A>holding their places during life; both instituted, as already told in the 
<A NAME="104"></A>life of Lycurgus, to restrain the power of the kings. Hence it was that 
<A NAME="105"></A>there was always from generation to generation a feud and contention between 
<A NAME="106"></A>them and the kings. But Agesilaus took another course. Instead of contending 
<A NAME="107"></A>with them, he courted them in all proceedings he commenced by taking their 
<A NAME="108"></A>advice, was always ready to go, nay almost run, when they called him; if 
<A NAME="109"></A>he were upon his royal seat, hearing causes, and the Ephors came in, he 
<A NAME="110"></A>rose to them; whenever any man was elected into the Council of Elders he 
<A NAME="111"></A>presented him with a gown and an ox. Thus, whilst he made a show of deference 
<A NAME="112"></A>to them, and of a desire to extend their authority, he secretly advanced 
<A NAME="113"></A>his own, and enlarged the prerogatives of the kings by several liberties 
<A NAME="114"></A>which their friendship to his person conceded.
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR>To other citizens he so behaved himself as to be less blamable 
<A NAME="116"></A>in his enmities than in his friendships; for against his enemy he forbore 
<A NAME="117"></A>to take any unjust advantage, but his friends he would assist, even in 
<A NAME="118"></A>what was unjust. If an enemy had done anything praiseworthy, he felt it 
<A NAME="119"></A>shameful to detract from his due, but his friends he knew not how to reprove 
<A NAME="120"></A>when they did ill, nay, he would eagerly join with them, and assist them 
<A NAME="121"></A>in their misdeed, and thought all offices of friendship commendable, let 
<A NAME="122"></A>the matter in which they were employed be what it would. Again, when any 
<A NAME="123"></A>of his adversaries was overtaken in a fault, he would be the first to pity 
<A NAME="124"></A>him; and he soon entreated to procure his pardon, by which he won the hearts 
<A NAME="125"></A>of all men. Insomuch that his popularity grew at last suspected by the 
<A NAME="126"></A>Ephors, who laid a fine on him, professing that he was appropriating the 
<A NAME="127"></A>citizens to himself who ought to be the common property of the state. For 
<A NAME="128"></A>as it is the opinion of philosophers, that could you take away strife and 
<A NAME="129"></A>opposition out of the universe, all the heavenly bodies would stand still, 
<A NAME="130"></A>generation and motion would cease in the mutual concord and agreement of 
<A NAME="131"></A>all things, so the Spartan legislator seems to have admitted ambition and 
<A NAME="132"></A>emulation among the ingredients of his commonwealth, as the incentives 
<A NAME="133"></A>of virtue, distinctly wishing that there should be some dispute and competition 
<A NAME="134"></A>among his men of worth, and pronouncing the mere idle, uncontested, mutual 
<A NAME="135"></A>compliance to unproved deserts to be but a false sort of concord. And some 
<A NAME="136"></A>think Homer had an eye to this when he introduces Agamemnon well pleased 
<A NAME="137"></A>with the quarrel arising between Ulysses and Achilles, and with the "terrible 
<A NAME="138"></A>words" that passed between them, which he would never have done, unless 
<A NAME="139"></A>he had thought emulation and dissensions between the noblest men to be 
<A NAME="140"></A>of great public benefit. Yet this maxim is not simply to be granted, without 
<A NAME="141"></A>restriction, for if animosities go too far they are very dangerous to cities 
<A NAME="142"></A>and of most pernicious consequence.
<A NAME="143"></A><BR><BR>When Agesilaus was newly entered upon the government, there came 
<A NAME="144"></A>news from Asia that the Persian king was making great naval preparations, 
<A NAME="145"></A>resolving with a high hand to dispossess the Spartans of their maritime 
<A NAME="146"></A>supremacy. Lysander was eager for the opportunity of going over and succouring 
<A NAME="147"></A>his friends in Asia, whom he had there left governors and masters of the 
<A NAME="148"></A>cities, whose maladministration and tyrannical behaviour was causing them 
<A NAME="149"></A>to be driven out, and in some cases put to death. He therefore persuaded 
<A NAME="150"></A>Agesilaus to claim the command of the expedition, and by carrying the war 
<A NAME="151"></A>from Greece into Persia, to anticipate the designs of the barbarian. He 
<A NAME="152"></A>also wrote to his friends in Asia, that by embassy they should demand Agesilaus 
<A NAME="153"></A>for their captain. Agesilaus, therefore, coming into the public assembly, 
<A NAME="154"></A>offered his service, upon condition that he might have thirty Spartans 
<A NAME="155"></A>for captains and counsellors; two thousand chosen men of the newly enfranchised 
<A NAME="156"></A>helots, and allies to the number of six thousand. Lysander's authority 
<A NAME="157"></A>and assistance soon obtained his request, so that he was sent away with 
<A NAME="158"></A>the thirty Spartans, of whom Lysander was at once the chief, not only because 
<A NAME="159"></A>of his power and reputation, but also on account of his friendship with 
<A NAME="160"></A>Agesilaus, who esteemed his procuring him this charge a greater obligation 
<A NAME="161"></A>than that of preferring him to the kingdom.
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR>Whilst the army was collecting to the rendezvous at Geraestus, 
<A NAME="163"></A>Agesilaus went with some of his friends to Aulis, where in a dream he saw 
<A NAME="164"></A>a man approach him, and speak to him after this manner: "O king of the 
<A NAME="165"></A>Lacedaemonians, you cannot but know that, before yourself, there hath been 
<A NAME="166"></A>but one general captain of the whole of the Greeks, namely, Agamemnon; 
<A NAME="167"></A>now, since you succeed him in the same office and command the same men, 
<A NAME="168"></A>since you war against the same enemies, and begin your expedition from 
<A NAME="169"></A>the same place, you ought also to offer such a sacrifice as he offered 
<A NAME="170"></A>before he weighed anchor." Agesilaus at the same moment remembered that 
<A NAME="171"></A>the sacrifice which Agamemnon offered was his own daughter, he being so 
<A NAME="172"></A>directed by the oracle. Yet was he not at all disturbed by it, but as soon 
<A NAME="173"></A>as he arose, he told his dream to his friends, adding that he would propitiate 
<A NAME="174"></A>the goddess with the sacrifices a goddess must delight in, and would not 
<A NAME="175"></A>follow the ignorant example of his predecessor. He therefore ordered an 
<A NAME="176"></A>hind to be crowned with chaplets, and bade his own soothsayer perform the 
<A NAME="177"></A>rite, not the usual person whom the Boeotians, in ordinary course, appointed 
<A NAME="178"></A>to that office. When the Boeotian magistrates understood it, they were 
<A NAME="179"></A>much offended, and sent officers to Agesilaus to forbid his sacrificing 
<A NAME="180"></A>contrary to the laws of the country. These, having delivered their message 
<A NAME="181"></A>to him, immediately went to the altar and threw down the quarters of the 
<A NAME="182"></A>hind that lay upon it. Agesilaus took this very ill, and without further 
<A NAME="183"></A>sacrifice immediately sailed away, highly displeased with the Boeotians, 
<A NAME="184"></A>and much discouraged in his mind at the omen, boding to himself an unsuccessful 
<A NAME="185"></A>voyage and an imperfect issue of the whole expedition.
<A NAME="186"></A><BR><BR>When he came to Ephesus, he found the power and interest of Lysander, 
<A NAME="187"></A>and the honours paid to him, insufferably great; all applications were 
<A NAME="188"></A>made to him, crowds of suitors attended at his door, and followed upon 
<A NAME="189"></A>his steps, as if nothing but the mere name of commander belonged, to satisfy 
<A NAME="190"></A>the usage, to Agesilaus, the whole power of it being devolved upon Lysander. 
<A NAME="191"></A>None of all the commanders that had been sent into Asia was either so powerful 
<A NAME="192"></A>or so formidable as he; no one had rewarded his friends better, or had 
<A NAME="193"></A>been more severe against his enemies; which things having been lately done, 
<A NAME="194"></A>made the greater impression on men's minds, especially when they compared 
<A NAME="195"></A>the simple and popular behaviour of Agesilaus with the harsh and violent 
<A NAME="196"></A>and brief-spoken demeanour which Lysander still retained. Universal preference 
<A NAME="197"></A>was yielded to this, and little regard shown to Agesilaus. This first occasioned 
<A NAME="198"></A>offence to the other Spartan captains, who resented that they should rather 
<A NAME="199"></A>seem the attendants of Lysander, than the councillors of Agesilaus. And 
<A NAME="200"></A>at length Agesilaus himself, though not perhaps an envious man in his nature, 
<A NAME="201"></A>nor apt to be troubled at the honours redounding upon other men, yet eager 
<A NAME="202"></A>for honour and jealous of his glory, began to apprehend that Lysander's 
<A NAME="203"></A>greatness would carry away from him the reputation of whatever great action 
<A NAME="204"></A>should happen. He therefore went this way to work. He first opposed him 
<A NAME="205"></A>in all his counsels; whatever Lysander specially advised was rejected, 
<A NAME="206"></A>and other proposals followed. Then whoever made any address to him, if 
<A NAME="207"></A>he found him attached to Lysander, certainly lost his suit. So also in 
<A NAME="208"></A>judicial cases, any one whom he spoke strongly against was sure to come 
<A NAME="209"></A>off with success, and any man whom he was particularly solicitous to procure 
<A NAME="210"></A>some benefit for might think it well if he got away without an actual 
<A NAME="211"></A>loss.
<A NAME="212"></A><BR><BR>These things being clearly not done by chance, but constantly and 
<A NAME="213"></A>of a set purpose, Lysander was soon sensible of them, and hesitated not 
<A NAME="214"></A>to tell his friends, that they suffered for his sake, bidding them apply 
<A NAME="215"></A>themselves to the king, and such as were more powerful with him than he 
<A NAME="216"></A>was. Such sayings of his seeming to be designed purposely to excite ill-feeling, 
<A NAME="217"></A>Agesilaus went on to offer himself a more open affront, appointing him 
<A NAME="218"></A>his meat-carver, and would in public companies, scornfully say, "Let them 
<A NAME="219"></A>go now and pay their court to my carver." Lysander, no longer able to brook 
<A NAME="220"></A>these indignities, complained at last to Agesilaus himself, telling him 
<A NAME="221"></A>that he knew very well how to humble his friends. Agesilaus answered, "I 
<A NAME="222"></A>know certainly how to humble those who pretend to more power than myself." 
<A NAME="223"></A>"That," replied Lysander, "is perhaps rather said by you, than done by 
<A NAME="224"></A>me: I desire only that you will assign me some office and place in which 
<A NAME="225"></A>I may serve you without incurring your displeasure."
<A NAME="226"></A><BR><BR>Upon this Agesilaus sent him to the Hellespont, whence he procured 
<A NAME="227"></A>Spithridates, a Persian of the province of Pharnabazus, to come to the 
<A NAME="228"></A>assistance of the Greeks with two hundred horse and a great supply of money. 
<A NAME="229"></A>Yet his anger did not so come down, but he thenceforward pursued the design 
<A NAME="230"></A>of wresting the kingdom out of the hands of the two families which then 
<A NAME="231"></A>enjoyed it, and making it wholly elective; and it is thought that he would 
<A NAME="232"></A>on account of his quarrel have excited a great commotion in Sparta, if 
<A NAME="233"></A>he had not died in the Boeotian war. Thus ambitious spirits in a commonwealth, 
<A NAME="234"></A>when they transgress their bounds, are apt to do more harm than good. For 
<A NAME="235"></A>though Lysander's pride and assumption was most ill-timed and insufferable 
<A NAME="236"></A>in its display, yet Agesilaus surely could have found some other way of 
<A NAME="237"></A>setting him right, less offensive to a man of his reputation and ambitious 
<A NAME="238"></A>temper. Indeed they were both blinded with the same passion, so as one 
<A NAME="239"></A>not to recognize the authority of his superior, the other not to bear with 
<A NAME="240"></A>the imperfections of his friend.
<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR>Tisaphernes, being at first afraid of Agesilaus, treated with him 
<A NAME="242"></A>about setting the Grecian cities at liberty, which was agreed on. But soon 
<A NAME="243"></A>after finding a sufficient force drawn together, he resolved upon war, 
<A NAME="244"></A>for which Agesilaus was not sorry. For the expectation of this expedition 
<A NAME="245"></A>was great, and he did not think it for his honour that Xenophon with ten 
<A NAME="246"></A>thousand men should march through the heart of Asia to the sea, beating 
<A NAME="247"></A>the Persian forces when and how he pleased, and that he at the head of 
<A NAME="248"></A>the Spartans, then sovereigns both at sea and land, should not achieve 
<A NAME="249"></A>some memorable action for Greece. And so to be even with Tisaphernes, he 
<A NAME="250"></A>requites his perjury by a fair stratagem. He pretends to march into Caria, 
<A NAME="251"></A>whither, when he has drawn Tisaphernes and his army, he suddenly turns 
<A NAME="252"></A>back, and falls upon Phrygia, takes many of their cities, and carries away 
<A NAME="253"></A>great booty, showing his allies that to break a solemn league was a downright 
<A NAME="254"></A>contempt of the gods, but the circumvention of an enemy in war was not 
<A NAME="255"></A>only just but glorious, a gratification at once and an 
<A NAME="256"></A>advantage.
<A NAME="257"></A><BR><BR>Being weak in horse, and discouraged by ill-omens in the sacrifices, 
<A NAME="258"></A>he retired to Ephesus, and there raised cavalry. He obliged the rich men, 
<A NAME="259"></A>that were not inclined to serve in person, to find each of them a horseman 
<A NAME="260"></A>armed and mounted, and there being many who preferred doing this, the army 
<A NAME="261"></A>was quickly reinforced by a body, not of unwilling recruits for the infantry, 
<A NAME="262"></A>but of brave and numerous horsemen. For those that were not good at fighting 
<A NAME="263"></A>themselves hired such as were more military in their inclinations, and 
<A NAME="264"></A>such as loved not horse-service substituted in their places such as did. 
<A NAME="265"></A>Agamemnon's example had been a good one, when he took the present of an 
<A NAME="266"></A>excellent mare to dismiss a rich coward from the army.
<A NAME="267"></A><BR><BR>When by Agesilaus's order the prisoners he had taken in Phrygia 
<A NAME="268"></A>were exposed to sale, they were first stripped of their garments and then 
<A NAME="269"></A>sold naked. The clothes found many customers to buy them, but the bodies 
<A NAME="270"></A>being, from the want of all exposure and exercise, white and tender-skinned, 
<A NAME="271"></A>were derided and scorned as unserviceable, Agesilaus, who stood by at the 
<A NAME="272"></A>auction, told his Greeks, "These are the men against whom ye fight, and 
<A NAME="273"></A>these the things you will gain by it."
<A NAME="274"></A><BR><BR>The season of the year being come, he boldly gave out that he would 
<A NAME="275"></A>invade Lydia; and this plain dealing of his was now mistaken for a stratagem 
<A NAME="276"></A>by Tisaphernes, who by not believing Agesilaus, having been already deceived 
<A NAME="277"></A>by him, overreached himself. He expected that he should have made choice 
<A NAME="278"></A>of Caria, as a rough country, not fit for horse, in which he deemed Agesilaus 
<A NAME="279"></A>to be weak, and directed his own marches accordingly. But when he found 
<A NAME="280"></A>him to be as good as his word, and to have entered into the country of 
<A NAME="281"></A>Sardis, he made great haste after him, and by great marches of his horse, 
<A NAME="282"></A>overtaking the loose stragglers who were pillaging the country, he cut 
<A NAME="283"></A>them off. Agesilaus meanwhile, considering that the horse had outridden 
<A NAME="284"></A>the foot, but that he himself had the whole body of his own army entire, 
<A NAME="285"></A>made haste to engage them. He mingled his light-armed foot, carrying targets, 
<A NAME="286"></A>with the horse, commanding them to advance at full speed and begin the 
<A NAME="287"></A>battle, whilst he brought up the heavier-armed men in the rear. The success 
<A NAME="288"></A>was answerable to the design; the barbarians were put to the rout, the 
<A NAME="289"></A>Grecians pursued hard, took their camp, and put many of them to the sword. 
<A NAME="290"></A>The consequence of this victory was very great; for they had not only the 
<A NAME="291"></A>liberty of foraging the Persian country, and plundering at pleasure, but 
<A NAME="292"></A>also saw Tisaphernes pay dearly for all the cruelty he had showed the Greeks, 
<A NAME="293"></A>to whom he was a professed enemy. For the King of Persia sent Tithraustes, 
<A NAME="294"></A>who took off his head, and presently dealt with Agesilaus about his return 
<A NAME="295"></A>into Greece, sending to him ambassadors to that purpose with commission 
<A NAME="296"></A>to offer him great sums of money. Agesilaus's answer was that the making 
<A NAME="297"></A>of peace belonged to the Lacedaemonians, not to him; as for wealth, he 
<A NAME="298"></A>had rather see it in his soldiers' hands than his own; that the Grecians 
<A NAME="299"></A>thought it not honourable to enrich themselves with the bribes of their 
<A NAME="300"></A>enemies, but with their spoils only. Yet, that he might gratify Tithraustes 
<A NAME="301"></A>for the justice he had done upon Tisaphernes, the common enemy of the Greeks, 
<A NAME="302"></A>he removed his quarters into Phrygia, accepting thirty talents for his 
<A NAME="303"></A>expenses. Whilst he was upon his march, he received a staff from the government 
<A NAME="304"></A>at Sparta, appointing him admiral as well as general. This was an honour 
<A NAME="305"></A>which was never done to any but Agesilaus, who being now undoubtedly the 
<A NAME="306"></A>greatest and most illustrious man of his time, still, as Theopompus had 
<A NAME="307"></A>said, gave himself more occasion of glory in his own virtue and merit than 
<A NAME="308"></A>was given him in this authority and power. Yet he committed a fault in 
<A NAME="309"></A>preferring Pisander to the command of the navy, when there were others 
<A NAME="310"></A>at hand both older and more experienced; in this not so much consulting 
<A NAME="311"></A>the public good as the gratification of his kindred, and especially his 
<A NAME="312"></A>wife, whose brother Pisander was.
<A NAME="313"></A><BR><BR>Having removed his camp into Pharnabazus's province, he not only 
<A NAME="314"></A>met with great plenty of provisions, but also raised great sums of money, 
<A NAME="315"></A>and marching on to the bounds of Paphlagonia, he soon drew Cotys, the king 
<A NAME="316"></A>of it, into a league, to which he of his own accord inclined, out of the 
<A NAME="317"></A>opinion he had of Agesilaus's honour and virtue. Spithridates, from the 
<A NAME="318"></A>time of his abandoning Pharnabazus, constantly attended Agesilaus in the 
<A NAME="319"></A>camp whithersoever he went. This Spithridates had a son, a very handsome 
<A NAME="320"></A>boy, called Megabates, of whom Agesilaus was extremely fond, and also a 
<A NAME="321"></A>very beautiful daughter that was marriageable. Her Agesilaus matched to 
<A NAME="322"></A>Cotys, and taking of him a thousand horse, with two thousand light-armed 
<A NAME="323"></A>foot, he returned into Phrygia, and there pillaged the country of Pharnabazus, 
<A NAME="324"></A>who durst not meet him in the field, nor yet trust to his garrisons, but 
<A NAME="325"></A>getting his valuables together, got out of the way and moved about up and 
<A NAME="326"></A>down with a flying army, till Spithridates, joining with Herippidas the 
<A NAME="327"></A>Spartan, took his camp and all his property. Herippidas being too severe 
<A NAME="328"></A>an inquirer into the plunder with which the barbarian soldiers had enriched 
<A NAME="329"></A>themselves, and forcing them to deliver it up with too much strictness, 
<A NAME="330"></A>so disobliged Spithridates with his questioning and examining that he changed 
<A NAME="331"></A>sides again, and went off with the Paphlagonians to Sardis. This was a 
<A NAME="332"></A>very great vexation to Agesilaus, not only that he had lost the friendship 
<A NAME="333"></A>of a gallant commander, and with him a considerable part of his army, but 
<A NAME="334"></A>still more that it had been done with the disrepute of a sordid and petty 
<A NAME="335"></A>covetousness, of which he always had made it a point of honour to keep 
<A NAME="336"></A>both himself and his country clear. Besides these public causes, he had 
<A NAME="337"></A>a private one, his excessive fondness for the son, which touched him to 
<A NAME="338"></A>the quick, though he endeavoured to master it, and, especially in presence 
<A NAME="339"></A>of the boy, to suppress all appearance of it; so much so that when Megabates, 
<A NAME="340"></A>for that was his name, came once to receive a kiss from him, he declined 
<A NAME="341"></A>it. At which, when the young boy blushed and drew back, and afterward saluted 
<A NAME="342"></A>him at a more reserved distance, Agesilaus soon repenting his coldness, 
<A NAME="343"></A>and changing his mind, pretended to wonder why he did not salute him with 
<A NAME="344"></A>the same familiarity as formerly. His friends about him answered, "You 
<A NAME="345"></A>are in the fault, who would not accept the kiss of the boy, but turned 
<A NAME="346"></A>away in alarm; he would come to you again if you would have the courage 
<A NAME="347"></A>to let him do so." Upon this Agesilaus paused a while, and at length answered, 
<A NAME="348"></A>"You need not encourage him to it; I think I had rather be master of myself 
<A NAME="349"></A>in that refusal, than see all things that are now before my eyes turned 
<A NAME="350"></A>into gold." Thus he demeaned himself to Megabates when present, but he 
<A NAME="351"></A>had so great a passion for him in his absence, that it may be questioned 
<A NAME="352"></A>whether, if the boy had returned again, all the courage he had would have 
<A NAME="353"></A>sustained him in such another refusal.
<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR>After this Pharnabazus sought an opportunity of conferring with 
<A NAME="355"></A>Agesilaus, which Apollophanes of Cyzicus, the common host of them both, 
<A NAME="356"></A>procured for him. Agesilaus coming first to the appointed place, threw 
<A NAME="357"></A>himself down upon the grass under a tree, lying there in expectation of 
<A NAME="358"></A>Pharnabazus, who, bringing with him soft skins and wrought carpets to lie 
<A NAME="359"></A>down upon, when he saw Agesilaus's posture, grew ashamed of his luxuries, 
<A NAME="360"></A>and made no use of them, but laid himself down upon the grass also, without 
<A NAME="361"></A>regard for his delicate and richly dyed clothing. Pharnabazus had matter 
<A NAME="362"></A>enough of complaint against Agesilaus, and therefore, after the mutual 
<A NAME="363"></A>civilities were over, he put him in mind of the great services he had done 
<A NAME="364"></A>the Lacedaemonians in the Attic war, of which he thought it an ill recompense 
<A NAME="365"></A>to have his country thus harassed and spoiled by those men who owed so 
<A NAME="366"></A>much to him. The Spartans that were present hung down their heads, as conscious 
<A NAME="367"></A>of the wrong they had done to their ally. But Agesilaus said, "We, O Pharnabazus, 
<A NAME="368"></A>when we were in amity with your master the king, behaved ourselves like 
<A NAME="369"></A>friends, and now that we are at war with him, we behave ourselves as enemies. 
<A NAME="370"></A>As for you, we must look upon you as a part of his property, and must do 
<A NAME="371"></A>these outrages upon you, not intending the harm to you, but to him whom 
<A NAME="372"></A>we wound through you. But whenever you will choose rather to be a friend 
<A NAME="373"></A>to the Grecians than a slave of the King of Persia, you may then reckon 
<A NAME="374"></A>this army and navy to be all at your command, to defend both you, your 
<A NAME="375"></A>country, and your liberties, without which there is nothing honourable 
<A NAME="376"></A>or indeed desirable among men." Upon this Pharnabazus discovered his mind, 
<A NAME="377"></A>and answered, "If the king sends another governor in my room, I will certainly 
<A NAME="378"></A>come over to you, but as long as he trusts me with the government I shall 
<A NAME="379"></A>be just to him, and not fail to do my utmost endeavours in opposing you." 
<A NAME="380"></A>Agesilaus was taken with the answer and shook hands with him; and rising, 
<A NAME="381"></A>said, "How much rather had I have so brave a man my friend than my 
<A NAME="382"></A>enemy."
<A NAME="383"></A><BR><BR>Pharnabazus being gone off, his son staying behind, ran up to Agesilaus, 
<A NAME="384"></A>and smilingly said, "Agesilaus, I make you my guest;" and thereupon presented 
<A NAME="385"></A>him with a javelin which he had in his hand. Agesilaus received it, and 
<A NAME="386"></A>being much taken with the good mien and courtesy of the youth, looked about 
<A NAME="387"></A>to see if there were anything in his train fit to offer him in return; 
<A NAME="388"></A>and observing the horse of Idaeus, the secretary, to have very fine trappings 
<A NAME="389"></A>on, he took them off, and bestowed them upon the young gentleman. Nor did 
<A NAME="390"></A>his kindness rest there, but he continued ever after to be mindful of him, 
<A NAME="391"></A>so that when he was driven out of his country by his brothers, and lived 
<A NAME="392"></A>in exile in Peloponnesus, he took great care of him and condescended even 
<A NAME="393"></A>to assist him in some love matters. He had an attachment for a youth of 
<A NAME="394"></A>Athenian birth, who was bred up as an athlete; and when at the Olympic 
<A NAME="395"></A>games this boy, on account of his great size and general strong and full-grown 
<A NAME="396"></A>appearance, was in some danger of not being admitted into the list, the 
<A NAME="397"></A>Persian betook himself to Agesilaus, and made use of his friendship. Agesilaus 
<A NAME="398"></A>readily assisted him, and not without a great deal of difficulty effected 
<A NAME="399"></A>his desires. He was in all other things a man of great and exact justice, 
<A NAME="400"></A>but when the case concerned a friend, to be strait-laced in point of justice, 
<A NAME="401"></A>he said, was only a colourable pretence of denying him. There is an epistle 
<A NAME="402"></A>written to Idrieus, Prince of Caria, that is ascribed to Agesilaus; it 
<A NAME="403"></A>is this: "If Nicias be innocent, absolve him; if he be guilty, absolve 
<A NAME="404"></A>him upon my account; however, be sure to absolve him." This was his usual 
<A NAME="405"></A>character in his deportment towards his friends. Yet his rule was not without 
<A NAME="406"></A>exception; for sometimes he considered the necessity of his affairs more 
<A NAME="407"></A>than his friend, of which he once gave an example, when upon a sudden and 
<A NAME="408"></A>disorderly removal of his camp, he left a sick friend behind him, and when 
<A NAME="409"></A>he called loudly after him, and implored his help, turned his back, and 
<A NAME="410"></A>said it was hard to be compassionate and wise too. This story is related 
<A NAME="411"></A>by Hieronymus, the philosopher.
<A NAME="412"></A><BR><BR>Another year of the war being spent, Agesilaus's fame still increased, 
<A NAME="413"></A>insomuch that the Persian king received daily information concerning his 
<A NAME="414"></A>many virtues, and the great esteem the world had of his temperance, his 
<A NAME="415"></A>plain living, and his moderation. When he made any journey, he would usually 
<A NAME="416"></A>take up his lodging in a temple, and there make the gods witnesses of his 
<A NAME="417"></A>most private actions, which others would scarce permit men to be acquainted 
<A NAME="418"></A>with. In so great an army you should scarce find a common soldier lie on 
<A NAME="419"></A>a coarser mattress than Agesilaus: he was so indifferent to the varieties 
<A NAME="420"></A>of heat and cold that all the seasons, as the gods sent them, seemed natural 
<A NAME="421"></A>to him. The Greeks that inhabited Asia were much pleased to see the great 
<A NAME="422"></A>lords and governors of Persia, with all the pride, cruelty, and luxury 
<A NAME="423"></A>in which they lived, trembling and bowing before a man in a poor threadbare 
<A NAME="424"></A>cloak, and, at one laconic word out of his mouth, obsequiously deferring 
<A NAME="425"></A>and changing their wishes and purposes. So that it brought to the minds 
<A NAME="426"></A>of many the verses of Timotheus-
<A NAME="427"></A><BR><BR>"Mars is the tyrant, gold Greece does not fear."
<A NAME="428"></A><BR><BR>Many parts of Asia now revolting from the Persians, Agesilaus restored 
<A NAME="429"></A>order in the cities, and without bloodshed or banishment of any of their 
<A NAME="430"></A>members re-established the proper constitution in the governments, and 
<A NAME="431"></A>now resolved to carry away the war from the seaside, and to march further 
<A NAME="432"></A>up into the country, and to attack the King of Persia himself in his own 
<A NAME="433"></A>home in Susa and Ecbatana; not willing to let the monarch sit idle in his 
<A NAME="434"></A>chair, playing umpire in the conflicts of the Greeks, and bribing their 
<A NAME="435"></A>popular leaders. But these great thoughts were interrupted by unhappy news 
<A NAME="436"></A>from Sparta; Epicydidas is from thence sent to remand him home, to assist 
<A NAME="437"></A>his own country, which was then involved in a great 
<A NAME="438"></A>war:-
<A NAME="439"></A><BR><BR>"Greece to herself doth a barbarian grow,
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>Others could not, she doth herself o'erthrow." What better can we say 
<A NAME="441"></A>of those jealousies, and that league and conspiracy of the Greeks for their 
<A NAME="442"></A>own mischief, which arrested fortune in full career, and turned back arms 
<A NAME="443"></A>that were already uplifted against the barbarians, to be used upon themselves, 
<A NAME="444"></A>and recalled into Greece the war which had been banished out of her? I 
<A NAME="445"></A>by no means assent to Demaratus of Corinth, who said that those Greeks 
<A NAME="446"></A>lost a great satisfaction that did not live to see Alexander sit in the 
<A NAME="447"></A>throne of Darius. That sight should rather have drawn tears from them, 
<A NAME="448"></A>when they considered that they had left that glory to Alexander and the 
<A NAME="449"></A>Macedonians, whilst they spent all their own great commanders in playing 
<A NAME="450"></A>them against each other in the fields of Leuctra, Coronea, Corinth, and 
<A NAME="451"></A>Arcadia.
<A NAME="452"></A><BR><BR>Nothing was greater or nobler than the behaviour of Agesilaus on 
<A NAME="453"></A>this occasion, nor can a nobler instance be found in story of a ready obedience 
<A NAME="454"></A>and just deference to orders. Hannibal, though in a bad condition himself 
<A NAME="455"></A>and, almost driven out of Italy, could scarcely be induced to obey when 
<A NAME="456"></A>he was called home to serve his country. Alexander made a jest of the battle 
<A NAME="457"></A>between Agis and Antipater, laughing and saying, "So, whilst we were conquering 
<A NAME="458"></A>Darius in Asia, it seems there was a battle of mice in Arcadia." Happy 
<A NAME="459"></A>Sparta, meanwhile, in the justice and modesty of Agesilaus, and in the 
<A NAME="460"></A>deference he paid to the laws of his country; who, immediately upon receipt 
<A NAME="461"></A>of his orders, though in the midst of his high fortune and power, and in 
<A NAME="462"></A>full hope of great and glorious success, gave all up and instantly departed, 
<A NAME="463"></A>"his object unachieved," leaving many regrets behind him among his allies 
<A NAME="464"></A>in Asia, and proving by his example the falseness of that saying of Demostratus. 
<A NAME="465"></A>the son of Phaeax, "That the Lacedaemonians were better in public, but 
<A NAME="466"></A>the Athenians in private." For while approving himself an excellent king 
<A NAME="467"></A>and general, he likewise showed himself in private an excellent friend 
<A NAME="468"></A>and a most agreeable companion.
<A NAME="469"></A><BR><BR>The coin of Persia was stamped with the figure of an archer; Agesilaus 
<A NAME="470"></A>said, That a thousand Persian archers had driven him out of Asia meaning, 
<A NAME="471"></A>the money that had been laid out in bribing the demagogues and the orators 
<A NAME="472"></A>in Thebes and Athens, and thus inciting those two states to hostility against 
<A NAME="473"></A>Sparta.
<A NAME="474"></A><BR><BR>Having passed the Hellespont, he marched by land through Thrace, 
<A NAME="475"></A>not begging or entreating a passage anywhere, only he sent his messengers 
<A NAME="476"></A>to them to demand whether they would have him pass as a friend or as an 
<A NAME="477"></A>enemy. All the rest received him as a friend, and assisted him on his journey. 
<A NAME="478"></A>But the Trallians, to whom Xerxes is also said to have given money, demanded 
<A NAME="479"></A>a price of him, namely, one hundred talents of silver and one hundred women. 
<A NAME="480"></A>Agesilaus in scorn asked, Why they were not ready to receive them? He marched 
<A NAME="481"></A>on, and finding the Trallians in arms to oppose him, fought them, and slew 
<A NAME="482"></A>great numbers of them. He sent the like embassy to the King of Macedonia, 
<A NAME="483"></A>who replied, He would take time to deliberate. "Let him deliberate," said 
<A NAME="484"></A>Agesilaus, "we will go forward in the meantime." The Macedonian, being 
<A NAME="485"></A>surprised and daunted the resolution of the Spartan, gave orders to let 
<A NAME="486"></A>him pass as a friend.
<A NAME="487"></A><BR><BR>When he came into Thessaly he wasted the country, because they 
<A NAME="488"></A>were in league with the enemy. To Larissa, the chief city of Thessaly, 
<A NAME="489"></A>he sent Xenocles and Scythes to treat of a peace, whom when the Larissaeans 
<A NAME="490"></A>had laid hold of, and put into custody, others were enraged, and advised 
<A NAME="491"></A>siege of the town; but he answered, That he valued either of those men 
<A NAME="492"></A>at more than the whole country of Thessaly. He therefore made terms with 
<A NAME="493"></A>them, and received his men again upon composition. Nor need wonder at this 
<A NAME="494"></A>saying of Agesilaus, since when he had news brought him from Sparta, of 
<A NAME="495"></A>several great captains in a battle near Corinth, in which the slaughter 
<A NAME="496"></A>fell upon other Greeks, and the Lacedaemonians obtained a great victory 
<A NAME="497"></A>with small loss, he did not appear at all satisfied; but with a great sigh 
<A NAME="498"></A>cried out, "O Greece, how many brave men hast thou destroyed; who, if they 
<A NAME="499"></A>had been preserved to so good an use, had sufficed to have conquered all 
<A NAME="500"></A>Persia!" Yet when the Pharsalians grew troublesome to him, by pressing 
<A NAME="501"></A>upon his army and incommoding his passage, he led out five hundred horse, 
<A NAME="502"></A>and in person fought and routed them, setting up a trophy under the mount 
<A NAME="503"></A>Narthacius. He valued himself very much upon that victory, that with so 
<A NAME="504"></A>small a number of his own training, he had vanquished a body of men that 
<A NAME="505"></A>thought themselves the best horsemen of Greece.
<A NAME="506"></A><BR><BR>Here Diphridas, the Ephor, met him, and delivered his message from 
<A NAME="507"></A>Sparta, which ordered him immediately to make an inroad into Boeotia; and 
<A NAME="508"></A>though he thought this fitter to have been done at another time, and with 
<A NAME="509"></A>greater force, he yet obeyed the magistrates. He thereupon told his soldiers 
<A NAME="510"></A>that the day had come on which they were to enter upon that employment 
<A NAME="511"></A>for the performance of which they were brought out of Asia. He sent for 
<A NAME="512"></A>two divisions of the army near Corinth to his assistance. The Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="513"></A>at home, in honour to him, made proclamations for volunteers that would 
<A NAME="514"></A>serve under the king to come in and be enlisted. Finding all the young 
<A NAME="515"></A>men in the city ready to offer themselves, they chose fifty of the strongest, 
<A NAME="516"></A>and sent them.
<A NAME="517"></A><BR><BR>Agesilaus having gained Thermopylae, and passed quietly through 
<A NAME="518"></A>Phocis, as soon as he had entered Boeotia, and pitched his camp near Chaeronea, 
<A NAME="519"></A>at once met with an eclipse of the sun, and with ill news from the navy, 
<A NAME="520"></A>Pisander, the Spartan admiral, being beaten and slain at Cnidos by Pharnabazus 
<A NAME="521"></A>and Conon. He was much moved at it, both upon his own and the public account. 
<A NAME="522"></A>Yet lest his army, being now near engaging, should meet with any discouragement, 
<A NAME="523"></A>he ordered the messengers to give out that the Spartans were the conquerors, 
<A NAME="524"></A>and he himself putting on garland, solemnly sacrificed for the good news, 
<A NAME="525"></A>and sent portions of the sacrifices to his friends.
<A NAME="526"></A><BR><BR>When he came near to Coronea, and was within view of the enemy, 
<A NAME="527"></A>he drew up his army, and giving the left wing to the Orchomenians, he himself 
<A NAME="528"></A>led the right. The Thebans took the right wing of their army, leaving the 
<A NAME="529"></A>left to the Argives. Xenophon, who was present, and fought on Agesilaus's 
<A NAME="530"></A>side, reports it to be the hardest-fought battle that he had seen. The 
<A NAME="531"></A>beginning of it was not so, for the Thebans soon put the Orchomenians to 
<A NAME="532"></A>rout, as also did Agesilaus the Argives. But both parties having news of 
<A NAME="533"></A>the misfortune of their left wings, they betook themselves to their relief. 
<A NAME="534"></A>Here Agesilaus might have been sure of his victory had he contented himself 
<A NAME="535"></A>not to charge them in the front, but in the flank or rear; but being angry 
<A NAME="536"></A>and heated in the fight he would not wait the opportunity, but fell on 
<A NAME="537"></A>at once, thinking to bear them down before him. The Thebans were not behind 
<A NAME="538"></A>him in courage, so that the battle was fiercely carried on on both sides, 
<A NAME="539"></A>especially near Agesilaus's person, whose new guard of fifty volunteers 
<A NAME="540"></A>stood him in great stead that day, and saved his life. They fought with 
<A NAME="541"></A>great valour, and interposed their bodies frequently between him and danger, 
<A NAME="542"></A>yet could they not so preserve him, but that he received many wounds through 
<A NAME="543"></A>his armour with lances and swords, and was with much difficulty gotten 
<A NAME="544"></A>off alive by their making a ring about him, and so guarding him, with the 
<A NAME="545"></A>slaughter of many of the enemy, and the loss of many of their own number. 
<A NAME="546"></A>At length, finding it too hard a task to break the front of the Theban 
<A NAME="547"></A>troops, they opened their own files, and let the enemy march through them 
<A NAME="548"></A>(an artifice which in the beginning they scorned), watching in the meantime 
<A NAME="549"></A>the posture of the enemy, who, having passed through, grew careless, as 
<A NAME="550"></A>esteeming themselves past danger, in which position they were immediately 
<A NAME="551"></A>set upon by the Spartans. Yet were they not then put to rout, but marched 
<A NAME="552"></A>on to Helicon, proud of what they had done, being able to say that they 
<A NAME="553"></A>themselves, as to their part of the army, were not worsted.
<A NAME="554"></A><BR><BR>Agesilaus, sore wounded as he was, would not be borne to his tent 
<A NAME="555"></A>till he had been first carried about the field, and had seen the dead conveyed 
<A NAME="556"></A>within his encampment. As many of his enemies as had taken sanctuary in 
<A NAME="557"></A>the temple he dismissed. For there stood near the battlefield the temple 
<A NAME="558"></A>of Minerva the Itonian, and before it a trophy erected by the Boeotians, 
<A NAME="559"></A>for or victory which, under the conduct of Sparton, their general, they 
<A NAME="560"></A>obtained over the Athenians under Tolmides, who himself fell in the battle. 
<A NAME="561"></A>Next morning early, to make trial of the Theban courage, whether they had 
<A NAME="562"></A>any mind to a second encounter, he commanded his soldiers to put on garlands 
<A NAME="563"></A>on their heads, and play with their flutes, and raise a trophy before their 
<A NAME="564"></A>faces; but when they, instead of fighting, sent for leave to bury their 
<A NAME="565"></A>dead, he gave it them; and having so assured himself of the victory, after 
<A NAME="566"></A>this he went to Delphi, to the Pythian games, which were then celebrating, 
<A NAME="567"></A>at which feast he assisted, and there solemnly offered the tenth part of 
<A NAME="568"></A>the spoils he had brought from Asia, which amounted to a hundred 
<A NAME="569"></A>talents.
<A NAME="570"></A><BR><BR>Thence he returned to his own country, where his way and habits 
<A NAME="571"></A>of life quickly excited the affection and admiration of the Spartans; for, 
<A NAME="572"></A>unlike other generals, he came home from foreign lands the same man that 
<A NAME="573"></A>he went out, having not so learned the fashions of other countries, as 
<A NAME="574"></A>to forget his own, much less to dislike or despise them. He followed and 
<A NAME="575"></A>respected all the Spartan customs, without any change either in the manner 
<A NAME="576"></A>of his supping, or bathing, or his wife's apparel, as if he had never travelled 
<A NAME="577"></A>over the river Eurotas. So also with his household furniture and his own 
<A NAME="578"></A>armour, nay, the very gates of his house were so old that they might well 
<A NAME="579"></A>be thought of Aristodemus's setting up. His daughter's Canathrum, says 
<A NAME="580"></A>Xenophon, was no richer than that of any one else. The Canathrum, as they 
<A NAME="581"></A>call it, is a chair or chariot made of wood, in the shape of a griffin, 
<A NAME="582"></A>or tragelaphus, on which the children and young virgins are carried in 
<A NAME="583"></A>processions. Xenophon has not left us the name of this daughter of Agesilaus; 
<A NAME="584"></A>and Dicaearchus expresses some indignation, because we do not know, he 
<A NAME="585"></A>says, the name of Agesilaus's daughter, nor of Epaminondas's mother. But 
<A NAME="586"></A>in the records of Laconia, we ourselves found his wife's name to have been 
<A NAME="587"></A>Cleora, and his two daughters to have been called Eupolia and Prolyta. 
<A NAME="588"></A>And you may also to this day see Agesilaus's spear kept in Sparta, nothing 
<A NAME="589"></A>differing from that of other men.
<A NAME="590"></A><BR><BR>there was a vanity he observed among the Spartans, about keeping 
<A NAME="591"></A>running horses for the Olympic games, upon which he found they much valued 
<A NAME="592"></A>themselves. Agesilaus regarded it as a display not of any real virtue, 
<A NAME="593"></A>but of wealth and expense; and to make this evident to the Greeks, induced 
<A NAME="594"></A>his sister, Cynisca, to send a chariot into the course. He kept with him 
<A NAME="595"></A>Xenophon, the philosopher, and made much of him, and proposed to him to 
<A NAME="596"></A>send for his children, and educate them at Sparta, where they would be 
<A NAME="597"></A>taught the best of all learning; how to obey, and how to command. Finding 
<A NAME="598"></A>on Lysander's death a large faction formed, which he on his return from 
<A NAME="599"></A>Asia had established against Agesilaus, he thought it advisable to expose 
<A NAME="600"></A>both him and it, by showing what manner of a citizen he had been whilst 
<A NAME="601"></A>he lived. To that end, finding among his writings an oration, composed 
<A NAME="602"></A>by Cleon the Halicarnassean, but to have been spoken by Lysander in a public 
<A NAME="603"></A>assembly, to excite the people to innovations and changes in the government, 
<A NAME="604"></A>he resolved to publish it as an evidence of Lysander's practices. But one 
<A NAME="605"></A>of the Elders having the perusal of it, and finding it powerfully written, 
<A NAME="606"></A>advised him to have a care of digging up Lysander again, and rather bury 
<A NAME="607"></A>that oration in the grave with him; and this advice he wisely hearkened 
<A NAME="608"></A>to, and hushed the whole thing up and ever after forbore publicly to affront 
<A NAME="609"></A>any of his adversaries, but took occasions of picking out the ringleaders, 
<A NAME="610"></A>and sending them away upon foreign services. He thus had means for exposing 
<A NAME="611"></A>the avarice and the injustice of many of them in their employments; and 
<A NAME="612"></A>again when they were by others brought into question, he made it his business 
<A NAME="613"></A>to bring them off, obliging them, by that means, of enemies to become his 
<A NAME="614"></A>friends, and so by degrees left none remaining.
<A NAME="615"></A><BR><BR>Agesipolis, his fellow-king, was under the disadvantage of being 
<A NAME="616"></A>born of an exiled father, and himself young, modest, and inactive, meddled 
<A NAME="617"></A>not much in affairs. Agesilaus took a course of gaining him over and making 
<A NAME="618"></A>him entirely tractable. According to the custom of Sparta, the kings, if 
<A NAME="619"></A>they were in town, always dined together. This was Agesilaus's opportunity 
<A NAME="620"></A>of dealing with Agesipolis, whom he found quick, as he himself was, in 
<A NAME="621"></A>forming attachments for young men, and accordingly talked with him always 
<A NAME="622"></A>on such subjects, joining and aiding him, and acting as his confidant, 
<A NAME="623"></A>such attachments in Sparta being entirely honourable, and attended always 
<A NAME="624"></A>with lively feelings of modesty, love of virtue, and a noble emulation; 
<A NAME="625"></A>of which more is said in Lycurgus's life.
<A NAME="626"></A><BR><BR>Having thus established his power in the city, he easily obtained 
<A NAME="627"></A>that his half-brother Teleutias might be chosen admiral, and thereupon 
<A NAME="628"></A>making an expedition against the Corinthians, he made himself master of 
<A NAME="629"></A>the long walls by land, through the assistance of his brother at sea. Coming 
<A NAME="630"></A>thus upon the Argives, who then held Corinth, in the midst of their Isthmian 
<A NAME="631"></A>festival, he made them fly from the sacrifice they had just commenced, 
<A NAME="632"></A>and leave all their festive provision behind them. The exiled Corinthians 
<A NAME="633"></A>that were in the Spartan army desired him to keep the feast, and to preside 
<A NAME="634"></A>in the celebration of it. This he refused, but gave them leave to carry 
<A NAME="635"></A>on the solemnity if they pleased, and he in the meantime stayed and guarded 
<A NAME="636"></A>them.
<A NAME="637"></A><BR><BR>When Agesilaus marched off, the Argives returned and celebrated 
<A NAME="638"></A>the games over again, when some who were victors before became victors 
<A NAME="639"></A>a second time; others lost the prizes which before they had gained. Agesilaus 
<A NAME="640"></A>thus made it clear to everybody that the Argives must in their own eyes 
<A NAME="641"></A>have been guilty of great cowardice since they set such a value on presiding 
<A NAME="642"></A>at the games, and yet had not dared to fight for it. He himself was of 
<A NAME="643"></A>opinion that to keep a mean in such things was best; he assisted at the 
<A NAME="644"></A>sports and dances usual in his own country, and was always ready and eager 
<A NAME="645"></A>to be present at the exercises either of the young men or of the girls, 
<A NAME="646"></A>but things that many men used to be highly taken with he seemed not at 
<A NAME="647"></A>all concerned about. Callippides, the tragic actor, who had a great name 
<A NAME="648"></A>in all Greece and was made much of once met and saluted him; of which when 
<A NAME="649"></A>he found no notice taken, he confidently thrust himself into his train, 
<A NAME="650"></A>expecting that Agesilaus would pay him some attention. When all that failed, 
<A NAME="651"></A>he boldly accosted him, and asked him whether he did not remember him? 
<A NAME="652"></A>Agesilaus turned, and looking him in the face, "Are you not," said he, 
<A NAME="653"></A>"Callippides the showman?" Being invited once to hear a man who admirably 
<A NAME="654"></A>imitated the nightingale, he declined, saying he had heard the nightingale 
<A NAME="655"></A>itself. Menecrates, the physician, having had great success in some desperate 
<A NAME="656"></A>diseases, was by way of flattery called Jupiter; he was so vain as to take 
<A NAME="657"></A>the name, and having occasion to write a letter to Agesilaus, thus addressed 
<A NAME="658"></A>it: "Jupiter Menecrates to King Agesilaus, greeting." The king returned 
<A NAME="659"></A>answer: "Agesilaus to Menecrates, health and a sound 
<A NAME="660"></A>mind."
<A NAME="661"></A><BR><BR>Whilst Agesilaus was in the Corinthian territories, having just 
<A NAME="662"></A>taken the Heraeum, he was looking on while his soldiers were carrying away 
<A NAME="663"></A>the prisoners and the plunder, when ambassadors from Thebes came to him 
<A NAME="664"></A>to treat of peace. Having a great aversion for that city, and thinking 
<A NAME="665"></A>it then advantageous to his affairs publicly to slight them, he took the 
<A NAME="666"></A>opportunity, and would not seem either to see them or hear them speak. 
<A NAME="667"></A>But as if on purpose to punish him in his pride, before they parted from 
<A NAME="668"></A>him, messengers came with news of the complete slaughter of one of the 
<A NAME="669"></A>Spartan divisions by Iphicrates, a greater disaster than had befallen them 
<A NAME="670"></A>for many years, and that the more grievous because it was a choice regiment 
<A NAME="671"></A>of full-armed Lacedaemonians overthrown by a parcel of mere mercenary targeteers. 
<A NAME="672"></A>Agesilaus leapt from his seat, to go at once to their rescue, but found 
<A NAME="673"></A>it too late, the business being over. He therefore returned to the Heraeum 
<A NAME="674"></A>and sent for the Theban ambassadors to give them audience. They now resolved 
<A NAME="675"></A>to be even with him for the affront he gave them, and without speaking 
<A NAME="676"></A>one word of the peace, only desired leave to go into Corinth. Agesilaus, 
<A NAME="677"></A>irritated with this proposal, told them in scorn, that if they were anxious 
<A NAME="678"></A>to go and see how proud their friends were of their success they should 
<A NAME="679"></A>do it to-morrow with safety. Next morning, taking the ambassadors with 
<A NAME="680"></A>him, he ravaged the Corinthian territories, up to the very gates of the 
<A NAME="681"></A>city, where, having made a stand, and let the ambassadors see that the 
<A NAME="682"></A>Corinthians durst not come out to defend themselves, he dismissed them. 
<A NAME="683"></A>Then gathering up the small remainders of the shattered regiment, he marched 
<A NAME="684"></A>homewards, always removing his camp before day, and always pitching his 
<A NAME="685"></A>tents after night, that he might prevent their enemies among the Arcadians 
<A NAME="686"></A>from taking any opportunity of insulting over their 
<A NAME="687"></A>loss.
<A NAME="688"></A><BR><BR>After this, at the request of the Achaeans, he marched with them 
<A NAME="689"></A>into Acarnania, and there collected great spoils, and defeated the Acarnanians 
<A NAME="690"></A>in battle. The Achaeans would have persuaded him to keep his winter quarters 
<A NAME="691"></A>there, to hinder the Acarnanians from sowing their corn; but he was of 
<A NAME="692"></A>the contrary opinion, alleging that they would be more afraid of a war 
<A NAME="693"></A>next summer, when their fields were sown, than they would be if they lay 
<A NAME="694"></A>fallow. The event justified his opinion; for next summer, when the Achaeans 
<A NAME="695"></A>began their expedition again, the Acarnanians immediately made peace with 
<A NAME="696"></A>them.
<A NAME="697"></A><BR><BR>When Conon and Pharnabazus with the Persian navy were grown masters 
<A NAME="698"></A>of the sea, and had not only infested the coast of Laconia, but also rebuilt 
<A NAME="699"></A>the walls of Athens at the cost of Pharnabazus, the Lacedaemonians thought 
<A NAME="700"></A>fit to treat of peace with the King of Persia. To that end, they sent Antalcidas 
<A NAME="701"></A>to Tiribazus, basely and wickedly betraying the Asiatic Greeks, on whose 
<A NAME="702"></A>behalf Agesilaus had made the war. But no part of this dishonour fell upon 
<A NAME="703"></A>Agesilaus, the whole being transacted by Antalcidas, who was his bitter 
<A NAME="704"></A>enemy, and was urgent for peace upon any terms, because war was sure to 
<A NAME="705"></A>increase his power and reputation. Nevertheless, once being told by way 
<A NAME="706"></A>of reproach that the Lacedaemonians had gone over to the Medes, he replied, 
<A NAME="707"></A>"No, the Medes had come over to the Lacedaemonians." And when the Greeks 
<A NAME="708"></A>were backward to submit to the agreement, he threatened them with war, 
<A NAME="709"></A>unless they fulfilled the King of Persia's conditions, his particular end 
<A NAME="710"></A>in this being to weaken the Thebans; for it was made one of the articles 
<A NAME="711"></A>of peace that the country of Boeotia should be left independent. This feeling 
<A NAME="712"></A>of his to Thebes appeared further afterwards, when Phoebidas, in full peace, 
<A NAME="713"></A>most unjustifiably seized upon the Cadmea. The thing was much resented 
<A NAME="714"></A>by all Greece, and not well liked by the Lacedaemonians themselves; those 
<A NAME="715"></A>especially who were enemies to Agesilaus required an account of the action, 
<A NAME="716"></A>and by whose authority it was done, laying the suspicion of it at his door. 
<A NAME="717"></A>Agesilaus resolutely answered, on the behalf of Phoebidas, that the profitableness 
<A NAME="718"></A>of the act was chiefly to be considered; if it were for the advantage of 
<A NAME="719"></A>the commonwealth, it was no matter whether it were done with or without 
<A NAME="720"></A>authority. This was the more remarkable in him, because in his ordinary 
<A NAME="721"></A>language he was always observed to be a great maintainer of justice, and 
<A NAME="722"></A>would commend it as the chief of virtues, saying, that valour without justice 
<A NAME="723"></A>was useless, and if all the world were just, there would be no need of 
<A NAME="724"></A>valour. When any would say to him, the Great King will have it so, he would 
<A NAME="725"></A>reply, "How is he greater than I, unless he be juster?" nobly and rightly 
<A NAME="726"></A>taking, as a sort of royal measure of greatness, justice and not force. 
<A NAME="727"></A>And thus when, on the conclusion of the peace, the King of Persia wrote 
<A NAME="728"></A>to Agesilaus, desiring a private friendship and relations of hospitality, 
<A NAME="729"></A>he refused it, saying that the public friendship was enough; whilst that 
<A NAME="730"></A>lasted there was no need of private. Yet in his acts he was not constant 
<A NAME="731"></A>to his doctrine, but sometimes out of ambition, and sometimes out of private 
<A NAME="732"></A>pique, he let himself be carried away; and particularly in this case of 
<A NAME="733"></A>the Thebans, he not only saved Phoebidas, but persuaded the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="734"></A>to take the fault upon themselves, and to retain the Cadmea, putting a 
<A NAME="735"></A>garrison into it, and to put the government of Thebes into the hands of 
<A NAME="736"></A>Archias and Leontidas, who had been betrayers of the castle to 
<A NAME="737"></A>them.
<A NAME="738"></A><BR><BR>This excited strong suspicion that what Phoebidas did was by Agesilaus's 
<A NAME="739"></A>order, which was corroborated by after-occurrences. For when the Thebans 
<A NAME="740"></A>had expelled the garrison, and asserted their liberty, he, accusing them 
<A NAME="741"></A>of the murder of Archias and Leontidas, who indeed were tyrants, though 
<A NAME="742"></A>in name holding the office of Polemarchs, made war upon them. He sent Cleombrotus 
<A NAME="743"></A>on that errand, who was now his fellow-king, in the place of Agesipolis, 
<A NAME="744"></A>who was dead, excusing himself by reason of his age for it was forty years 
<A NAME="745"></A>since he had first borne arms, and he was consequently exempt by the law; 
<A NAME="746"></A>meanwhile the true reason was, that he was ashamed, having so lately fought 
<A NAME="747"></A>against tyranny in behalf of the Phliasians, to fight now in defence of 
<A NAME="748"></A>a tyranny against the Thebans.
<A NAME="749"></A><BR><BR>One Sphodrias, of Lacedaemon, of the contrary faction to Agesilaus, 
<A NAME="750"></A>was governor in Thespiae, a bold and enterprising man, though he had perhaps 
<A NAME="751"></A>more of confidence than wisdom. This action of Phoebidas fired him, and 
<A NAME="752"></A>incited his ambition to attempt some great enterprise, which might render 
<A NAME="753"></A>him as famous as he perceived the taking of the Cadmea had made Phoebidas. 
<A NAME="754"></A>He thought the sudden capture of the Piraeus, and the cutting off thereby 
<A NAME="755"></A>the Athenians from the sea, would be a matter of far more glory. It is 
<A NAME="756"></A>said, too, that Pelopidas and Melon, the chief captains of Boeotia, put 
<A NAME="757"></A>him upon it; that they privately sent men to him, pretending to be of the 
<A NAME="758"></A>Spartan faction, who, highly commending Sphodrias, filled him with a great 
<A NAME="759"></A>opinion of himself, protesting him to be the only man in the world that 
<A NAME="760"></A>was fit for so great an enterprise. Being thus stimulated, he could hold 
<A NAME="761"></A>no longer, but hurried into an attempt as dishonourable and treacherous 
<A NAME="762"></A>as that of the Cadmea, but executed with less valour and less success; 
<A NAME="763"></A>for the day broke whilst he was yet in the Thriasian plain, whereas he 
<A NAME="764"></A>designed the whole exploit to have been done in the night. As soon as the 
<A NAME="765"></A>soldiers perceived the rays of light reflecting from the temples of Eleusis, 
<A NAME="766"></A>upon the first rising of the sun, it is said that their hearts failed them; 
<A NAME="767"></A>nay, he himself, when he saw that he could not have the benefit of the 
<A NAME="768"></A>night, had not courage enough to go on with his enterprise; but having 
<A NAME="769"></A>pillaged the country, he returned with shame to Thespiae. An embassy was 
<A NAME="770"></A>upon this sent from Athens to Sparta, to complain of the breach of peace; 
<A NAME="771"></A>but the ambassadors found their journey needless, Sphodrias being then 
<A NAME="772"></A>under process by the magistrates of Sparta. Sphodrias durst not stay to 
<A NAME="773"></A>expect judgment, which he found would be capital, the city being highly 
<A NAME="774"></A>incensed against him, out of the shame they felt at the business, and their 
<A NAME="775"></A>desire to appear in the eyes of the Athenians as fellow-sufferers in the 
<A NAME="776"></A>wrong, rather than accomplices in its being done.
<A NAME="777"></A><BR><BR>This Sphodrias had a son of great beauty named Cleonymus, to whom 
<A NAME="778"></A>Archidamus, the son of Agesilaus, was extremely attached. Archidamus, as 
<A NAME="779"></A>became him, was concerned for the danger of his friend's father, but yet 
<A NAME="780"></A>he durst not do anything openly for his assistance, he being one of the 
<A NAME="781"></A>professed enemies of Agesilaus. But Cleonymus having solicited him with 
<A NAME="782"></A>tears about it, as knowing Agesilaus to be of all his father's enemies 
<A NAME="783"></A>the most formidable, the young man for two or three days followed after 
<A NAME="784"></A>his father with such fear and confusion that he durst not speak to him. 
<A NAME="785"></A>At last, the day of sentence being at hand, he ventured to tell him that 
<A NAME="786"></A>Cleonymus had entreated him to intercede for his father. Agesilaus, though 
<A NAME="787"></A>well aware of the love between the two young men, yet did not prohibit 
<A NAME="788"></A>it, because Cleonymus from his earliest years had been looked upon as a 
<A NAME="789"></A>youth of very great promise; yet he gave not his son any kind or hopeful 
<A NAME="790"></A>answer in the case, but coldly told him that he would consider what he 
<A NAME="791"></A>could honestly and honourably do in it, and so dismissed him. Archidamus 
<A NAME="792"></A>being ashamed of his want of success, forbore the company of Cleonymus, 
<A NAME="793"></A>whom he usually saw several times every day. This made the friends of Sphodrias 
<A NAME="794"></A>to think his case desperate, till Etymocles, one of Agesilaus's friends, 
<A NAME="795"></A>discovered to them the king's mind; namely, that he abhorred the fact, 
<A NAME="796"></A>but yet he thought Sphodrias a gallant man such as the commonwealth much 
<A NAME="797"></A>wanted at that time. For Agesilaus used to talk thus concerning the cause, 
<A NAME="798"></A>out of a desire to gratify his son. And now Cleonymus quickly understood 
<A NAME="799"></A>that Archidamus had been true to him, in using all his interests with his 
<A NAME="800"></A>father; and Sphodrias's friend ventured to be forward in his defence. The 
<A NAME="801"></A>truth is, that Agesilaus was excessively fond of his children; and it is 
<A NAME="802"></A>to him the story belongs, that when they were little ones, he used to make 
<A NAME="803"></A>a horse of a stick, and ride with them; and being caught at this sport 
<A NAME="804"></A>by a friend, he desired him not to mention it till he himself were the 
<A NAME="805"></A>father of children.
<A NAME="806"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile, Sphodrias being acquitted, the Athenians betook themselves 
<A NAME="807"></A>to arms, and Agesilaus fell into disgrace with the people; since to gratify 
<A NAME="808"></A>the whims of a boy he had been willing to pervert justice, and make the 
<A NAME="809"></A>city accessory to the crimes of private men, whose most unjustifiable actions 
<A NAME="810"></A>had broken the peace of Greece. He also found his colleague, Cleombrotus, 
<A NAME="811"></A>little inclined to the Theban war; so that it became necessary for him 
<A NAME="812"></A>to waive the privilege of his age, which he before had claimed, and to 
<A NAME="813"></A>lead the army himself into Boeotia; which he did with variety of success, 
<A NAME="814"></A>sometimes conquering, and sometimes conquered; insomuch that receiving 
<A NAME="815"></A>a wound in a battle, he was reproached by Antalcidas, that the Thebans 
<A NAME="816"></A>had paid him well for the lessons he had given them in fighting. And, indeed, 
<A NAME="817"></A>they were now grown far better soldiers than ever they had been, being 
<A NAME="818"></A>so continually kept in training by the frequency of the Lacedaemonian expeditions 
<A NAME="819"></A>against them. Out of the foresight of which it was that anciently Lycurgus, 
<A NAME="820"></A>in three several laws, forbade them to make any wars with the same nation, 
<A NAME="821"></A>as this would be to instruct their enemies in the art of it. Meanwhile, 
<A NAME="822"></A>the allies of Sparta were not a little discontented at Agesilaus, because 
<A NAME="823"></A>this war was commenced not upon any fair public ground of quarrel, but 
<A NAME="824"></A>merely out of his private hatred to the Thebans; and they complained with 
<A NAME="825"></A>indignation that they, being the majority of the army, should from year 
<A NAME="826"></A>to year be thus exposed to danger and hardship here and there, at the will 
<A NAME="827"></A>of a few persons. It was at this time, we are told, that Agesilaus, to 
<A NAME="828"></A>obviate the objection, devised this expedient, to show the allies were 
<A NAME="829"></A>not the greater number. He gave orders that all the allies, of whatever 
<A NAME="830"></A>country, should sit down promiscuously on one side, and all the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="831"></A>on the other: which being done, he commanded a herald to proclaim, that 
<A NAME="832"></A>all the potters of both divisions should stand out; then all the blacksmiths; 
<A NAME="833"></A>then all the masons; next the carpenters; and so he went through all the 
<A NAME="834"></A>handicrafts. By this time almost all the allies were risen, but of the 
<A NAME="835"></A>Lacedaemonians not a man, they being by law forbidden to learn any mechanical 
<A NAME="836"></A>business; and now Agesilaus laughed and said, "You see my friends, how 
<A NAME="837"></A>many more soldiers we send out than you do."
<A NAME="838"></A><BR><BR>When he brought back his army from Boeotia through Megara, as he 
<A NAME="839"></A>was going up to the magistrate's office in the Acropolis, he was suddenly 
<A NAME="840"></A>seized with pain and cramp in his sound leg, and great swelling and inflammation 
<A NAME="841"></A>ensued. He was treated by a Syracusan physician, who let him blood below 
<A NAME="842"></A>the ankle; this soon eased his pain, but then the blood could not be stopped, 
<A NAME="843"></A>till the loss of it brought on fainting and swooning; at length, with much 
<A NAME="844"></A>trouble, he stopped it. Agesilaus was carried home to Sparta in a very 
<A NAME="845"></A>weak condition, and did not recover strength enough to appear in the field 
<A NAME="846"></A>for a long time after.
<A NAME="847"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile, the Spartan fortune was but ill; they received many 
<A NAME="848"></A>losses both by sea and land; but the greatest was that at Tegyrae, when 
<A NAME="849"></A>for the first time they were beaten by the Thebans in a set 
<A NAME="850"></A>battle.
<A NAME="851"></A><BR><BR>All the Greeks were, accordingly, disposed to a general peace, 
<A NAME="852"></A>and to that end ambassadors came to Sparta. Among these was Epaminondas, 
<A NAME="853"></A>the Theban, famous at that time for his philosophy and learning, but he 
<A NAME="854"></A>had not yet given proof of his capacity as a general. He, seeing all the 
<A NAME="855"></A>others crouch to Agesilaus, and court favour with him, alone maintained 
<A NAME="856"></A>the dignity of an ambassador, and with that freedom that became his character 
<A NAME="857"></A>made a speech in behalf not of Thebes only, from whence he came, but of 
<A NAME="858"></A>all Greece, remonstrating that Sparta alone grew great by war, to the distress 
<A NAME="859"></A>and suffering of all her neighbours. He urged that a peace should be made 
<A NAME="860"></A>upon just and equal terms, such as alone would be a lasting one, which 
<A NAME="861"></A>could not otherwise be done than by reducing all to equality. Agesilaus, 
<A NAME="862"></A>perceiving all the other Greeks to give much attention to this discourse, 
<A NAME="863"></A>and to be pleased with it, presently asked him whether he thought it a 
<A NAME="864"></A>part of this justice and equality that the Boeotian towns should enjoy 
<A NAME="865"></A>their independence. Epaminondas instantly and without wavering asked him 
<A NAME="866"></A>in return, whether he thought it just and equal that the Laconian towns 
<A NAME="867"></A>should enjoy theirs. Agesilaus started from his seat and bade him once 
<A NAME="868"></A>for all speak out and say whether or not Boeotia should be independent. 
<A NAME="869"></A>And when Epaminondas replied once again with the same inquiry, whether 
<A NAME="870"></A>Laconia should be so, Agesilaus was so enraged that, availing himself of 
<A NAME="871"></A>the pretext, he immediately struck the name of the Thebans out of the league, 
<A NAME="872"></A>and declared war against them. With the rest of the Greeks he made a peace, 
<A NAME="873"></A>and dismissed them with this saying, that what could be peaceably adjusted, 
<A NAME="874"></A>should; what was otherwise incurable, must be committed to the success 
<A NAME="875"></A>of war, it being a thing of too great difficulty to provide for all things 
<A NAME="876"></A>by treaty.
<A NAME="877"></A><BR><BR>The Ephors upon this despatched their orders to Cleombrotus, who 
<A NAME="878"></A>was at that time in Phocis, to march directly into Boeotia, and at the 
<A NAME="879"></A>same time sent to their allies for aid. The confederates were very tardy 
<A NAME="880"></A>in their business and unwilling to engage, but as yet they feared the Spartans 
<A NAME="881"></A>too much to dare to refuse. And although many portents and prodigies of 
<A NAME="882"></A>ill-presage, which I have mentioned in the life of Epaminondas, had appeared, 
<A NAME="883"></A>and though Prothous, the Laconian, did all he could to hinder it, yet Agesilaus 
<A NAME="884"></A>would needs go forward, and prevailed so, that the war was decreed. He 
<A NAME="885"></A>thought the present juncture of affairs very advantageous for their revenge, 
<A NAME="886"></A>the rest of Greece being wholly free, and the Thebans excluded from the 
<A NAME="887"></A>peace. But that this war was undertaken more upon passion than judgment 
<A NAME="888"></A>the event may prove; for the treaty was finished but the fourteenth of 
<A NAME="889"></A>Scirophorion, and the Lacedaemonians received their great overthrow at 
<A NAME="890"></A>Leuctra on the fifth of Hecatombaeon, within twenty days. There fell at 
<A NAME="891"></A>that time a thousand Spartans, and Cleombrotus their king, and around him 
<A NAME="892"></A>the bravest men of the nation; particularly the beautiful youth, Cleonymus, 
<A NAME="893"></A>the son of Sphodrias, who was thrice struck down at the feet of the king, 
<A NAME="894"></A>and as often rose, but was slain at the last.
<A NAME="895"></A><BR><BR>This unexpected blow, which fell so heavy upon the Lacedaemonians, 
<A NAME="896"></A>brought greater glory to Thebes than ever was acquired by any other of 
<A NAME="897"></A>the Grecian republics in their civil wars against each other. The behaviour, 
<A NAME="898"></A>notwithstanding, of the Spartans, though beaten, was as great, and as highly 
<A NAME="899"></A>to be admired, as that of the Thebans. And indeed, if, as Xenophon says, 
<A NAME="900"></A>in conversation good men even in their sports and at their wine let fall 
<A NAME="901"></A>many sayings that are worth the preserving, how much more worthy to be 
<A NAME="902"></A>recorded is an exemplary constancy of mind, as shown both in the words 
<A NAME="903"></A>and in the acts of brave men when they are pressed by adverse fortune! 
<A NAME="904"></A>It happened that the Spartans were celebrating a solemn feast, at which 
<A NAME="905"></A>many strangers were present from other countries, and the town full of 
<A NAME="906"></A>them, when this news of the overthrow came. It was the gymnopaediae, and 
<A NAME="907"></A>the boys were dancing in the theatre, when the messengers arrived from 
<A NAME="908"></A>Leuctra. The Ephors, though they were sufficiently aware that this blow 
<A NAME="909"></A>had ruined the Spartan power, and that their primacy over the rest of Greece 
<A NAME="910"></A>was gone for ever, yet gave orders that the dances should not break off, 
<A NAME="911"></A>nor any of the celebration of the festival abate; but privately sending 
<A NAME="912"></A>the names of the slain to each family, out of which they were lost, they 
<A NAME="913"></A>continued the public spectacles. The next morning when they had full intelligence 
<A NAME="914"></A>concerning it, and everybody knew who were slain, and who survived, the 
<A NAME="915"></A>fathers, relatives, and friends of the slain came out rejoicing in the 
<A NAME="916"></A>market-place, saluting each other with a kind of exultation; on the contrary, 
<A NAME="917"></A>the fathers of the survivors hid themselves at home among the women. If 
<A NAME="918"></A>necessity drove any of them abroad they went very dejectedly, with downcast 
<A NAME="919"></A>looks and sorrowful countenances. The women outdid the men in it; those 
<A NAME="920"></A>whose sons were slain openly rejoicing, cheerfully making visits to one 
<A NAME="921"></A>another, and meeting triumphantly in the temples; they who expected their 
<A NAME="922"></A>children home being very silent and much troubled.
<A NAME="923"></A><BR><BR>But the people in general, when their allies now began to desert 
<A NAME="924"></A>them, and Epaminondas, in all the confidence of victory, was expected with 
<A NAME="925"></A>an invading army in Peloponnesus, began to think again of Agesilaus's lameness, 
<A NAME="926"></A>and to entertain feelings of religious fear and despondency, as if their 
<A NAME="927"></A>having rejected the sound-footed, and having chosen the halting king, which 
<A NAME="928"></A>the oracle had specially warned them against, was the occasion of all their 
<A NAME="929"></A>distresses. Yet the regard they had to the merit and reputation of Agesilaus 
<A NAME="930"></A>so far stilled this murmuring of the people that, notwithstanding it, they 
<A NAME="931"></A>intrusted themselves to him in this distress, as the only man that was 
<A NAME="932"></A>fit to heal the public malady, the arbiter of all their difficulties, whether 
<A NAME="933"></A>relating to the affairs of war or peace. One great one was then before 
<A NAME="934"></A>them concerning the runaways (as their name is for them) that had fled 
<A NAME="935"></A>out of the battle, who being many and powerful, it was feared that they 
<A NAME="936"></A>might make some commotion in the republic, to prevent the execution of 
<A NAME="937"></A>the law upon them for their cowardice. The law in that case was very severe; 
<A NAME="938"></A>for they were not only to be debarred from all honours, but also it was 
<A NAME="939"></A>a disgrace to intermarry with them; whoever met any of them in the streets 
<A NAME="940"></A>might beat him if he chose, nor was it lawful for him to resist; they, 
<A NAME="941"></A>in the meanwhile, were obliged to go about unwashed and meanly dressed, 
<A NAME="942"></A>with their clothes patched with divers colours, and to wear their beards 
<A NAME="943"></A>half shaved, half unshaven. To execute so rigid a law as this, in a case 
<A NAME="944"></A>where the offenders were so many, and many of them of such distinction, 
<A NAME="945"></A>and that in a time when the commonwealth wanted soldiers so much as then 
<A NAME="946"></A>it did, was of dangerous consequence. Therefore they chose Agesilaus as 
<A NAME="947"></A>a sort of new lawgiver for the occasion. But he, without adding to or diminishing 
<A NAME="948"></A>from or any way changing the law, came out into the public assembly, and 
<A NAME="949"></A>said that the law should sleep for to-day, but from this day forth be vigorously 
<A NAME="950"></A>executed. By this means he at once preserved the law from abrogation and 
<A NAME="951"></A>the citizens from infamy; and that he might alleviate the despondency and 
<A NAME="952"></A>self-distrust of the young men, he made an inroad into Arcadia, where, 
<A NAME="953"></A>carefully avoiding all fighting, he contended himself with spoiling the 
<A NAME="954"></A>territory, and taking a small town belonging to the Mantineans, thus reviving 
<A NAME="955"></A>the hearts of the people, letting them see that they were not everywhere 
<A NAME="956"></A>unsuccessful.
<A NAME="957"></A><BR><BR>Epaminondas now invaded Laconia with an army of forty thousand, 
<A NAME="958"></A>besides light-armed men and others that followed the camp only for plunder, 
<A NAME="959"></A>so that in all they were at least seventy thousand. It was now six hundred 
<A NAME="960"></A>years since the Dorians had possessed Laconia, and in all that time the 
<A NAME="961"></A>face of an enemy had not been seen within their territories, no man daring 
<A NAME="962"></A>to invade them; but now they made their entrance, and burnt and plundered 
<A NAME="963"></A>without resistance the hitherto untouched and sacred territory up to Eurotas 
<A NAME="964"></A>and the very suburbs of Sparta; for Agesilaus would not permit them to 
<A NAME="965"></A>encounter so impetuous a torrent, as Theopompus calls it, of war. He contented 
<A NAME="966"></A>himself with fortifying the chief parts of the city, and with placing guards 
<A NAME="967"></A>in convenient places, enduring meanwhile the taunts of the Thebans, who 
<A NAME="968"></A>reproached him by name as the kindler of the war, and the author of all 
<A NAME="969"></A>that mischief to his country, bidding him defend himself if he could. But 
<A NAME="970"></A>this was not all; he was equally disturbed at home with the tumults of 
<A NAME="971"></A>the city, the outcries and running about of the old men, who were enraged 
<A NAME="972"></A>at their present condition, and the women yet worse, out of their senses 
<A NAME="973"></A>with the clamours, and the fires of the enemy in the field. He was also 
<A NAME="974"></A>himself afflicted by the sense of his lost glory; who, having come to the 
<A NAME="975"></A>throne of Sparta when it was in its most flourishing and powerful condition, 
<A NAME="976"></A>now lived to see it laid low in esteem, and all its great vaunts cut down, 
<A NAME="977"></A>even that which he himself had been accustomed to use, that the women of 
<A NAME="978"></A>Sparta had never seen the smoke of the enemy's fire. As it is said, also, 
<A NAME="979"></A>that when Antalcidas, once being in dispute with an Athenian about the 
<A NAME="980"></A>valour of the two nations, the Athenian boasted that they had often driven 
<A NAME="981"></A>the Spartans from the river Cephisus, "Yes," said Antalcidas, "but we never 
<A NAME="982"></A>had occasion to drive you from Eurotas." And a common Spartan of less note, 
<A NAME="983"></A>being in company with an Argive, who was bragging how many Spartans lay 
<A NAME="984"></A>buried in the fields of Argos, replied, "None of you are buried in the 
<A NAME="985"></A>country of Laconia." Yet now the case was so altered that Antalcidas, being 
<A NAME="986"></A>one of the Ephors, out of fear sent away his children privately to the 
<A NAME="987"></A>island of Cythera.
<A NAME="988"></A><BR><BR>When the enemy essayed to get over the river, and thence to attack 
<A NAME="989"></A>the town, Agesilaus, abandoning the rest, betook himself to the high places 
<A NAME="990"></A>and strongholds of it. But it happened Eurotas at that time was swollen 
<A NAME="991"></A>to a great height with snow that had fallen and made the passage very difficult 
<A NAME="992"></A>to the Thebans, not only by its depth, but much more by its extreme coldness. 
<A NAME="993"></A>Whilst this was doing, Epaminondas was seen in the front of the phalanx, 
<A NAME="994"></A>and was pointed out to Agesilaus, who looked long at him, and said but 
<A NAME="995"></A>these words, "O bold man!" But when he came to the city, and would have 
<A NAME="996"></A>fain attempted something within the limits of it that might raise him a 
<A NAME="997"></A>trophy there, he could not tempt Agesilaus out of his hold, but was forced 
<A NAME="998"></A>to march off again, wasting the country as he went.
<A NAME="999"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile, a body of long discontented and bad citizens, about 
<A NAME="1000"></A>two hundred in number, having got into a strong part of the town called 
<A NAME="1001"></A>the Issorion, where the temple of Diana stands, seized and garrisoned it. 
<A NAME="1002"></A>The Spartans would have fallen upon them instantly; but Agesilaus, not 
<A NAME="1003"></A>knowing how far the sedition might reach, bade them forbear, and going 
<A NAME="1004"></A>himself in his ordinary dress, with but one servant, when he came near 
<A NAME="1005"></A>the rebels, called out, and told them that they mistook their orders; this 
<A NAME="1006"></A>was not the right place; they were to go, one part of them thither, showing 
<A NAME="1007"></A>them another place in the city, and part to another, which he also showed. 
<A NAME="1008"></A>The conspirators gladly heard this, thinking themselves unsuspected of 
<A NAME="1009"></A>treason, and readily went off to the places which he showed them. Whereupon 
<A NAME="1010"></A>Agesilaus placed in their room a guard of his own; and of the conspirators 
<A NAME="1011"></A>he apprehended fifteen, and put them to death in the night. But after this 
<A NAME="1012"></A>a much more dangerous conspiracy was discovered of Spartan citizens, who 
<A NAME="1013"></A>had privately met in each other's houses, plotting a revolution. These 
<A NAME="1014"></A>were men whom it was equally dangerous to prosecute publicly according 
<A NAME="1015"></A>to law and to connive at. Agesilaus took council with the Ephors, and put 
<A NAME="1016"></A>these also to death privately without process; a thing never before known 
<A NAME="1017"></A>in the case of any born Spartan.
<A NAME="1018"></A><BR><BR>At this time, also, many of the helots and country people, who 
<A NAME="1019"></A>were in the army, ran away to the enemy, which was a matter of great consternation 
<A NAME="1020"></A>to the city. He therefore caused some officers of his, every morning, before 
<A NAME="1021"></A>day, to search the quarters of the soldiers, and where any man was gone, 
<A NAME="1022"></A>to hide his arms, that so the greatness of the number might not 
<A NAME="1023"></A>appear.
<A NAME="1024"></A><BR><BR>Historians differ about the cause of the Thebans' departure from 
<A NAME="1025"></A>Sparta. Some say the winter forced them; as also that the Arcadian soldiers 
<A NAME="1026"></A>disbanding, made it necessary for the rest to retire. Others say that they 
<A NAME="1027"></A>stayed there three months, till they had laid the whole country waste. 
<A NAME="1028"></A>Theopompus is the only author who says that when the Boeotian generals 
<A NAME="1029"></A>had already resolved upon the retreat, Phrixus, the Spartan, came to them, 
<A NAME="1030"></A>and offered them from Agesilaus ten talents to be gone, so hiring them 
<A NAME="1031"></A>to do what they were already doing of their own accord. How he alone should 
<A NAME="1032"></A>come to be aware of this I know not; only in this all authors agree, that 
<A NAME="1033"></A>the saving of Sparta from ruin was wholly due to the wisdom of Agesilaus, 
<A NAME="1034"></A>who in this extremity of affairs quitted all his ambition and his haughtiness, 
<A NAME="1035"></A>and resolved to play a saving game. But all his wisdom and courage was 
<A NAME="1036"></A>not sufficient to recover the glory of it, and to raise it to its ancient 
<A NAME="1037"></A>greatness. For as we see in human bodies, long used to a very strict and 
<A NAME="1038"></A>too exquisitely regular diet, any single great disorder is usually fatal; 
<A NAME="1039"></A>so here one stroke overthrew the whole state's long prosperity. Nor can 
<A NAME="1040"></A>we be surprised at this. Lycurgus had formed a polity admirably designed 
<A NAME="1041"></A>for the peace, harmony, and virtuous life of the citizens; and their fall 
<A NAME="1042"></A>came from their assuming foreign dominion and arbitrary sway, things wholly 
<A NAME="1043"></A>undesirable, in the judgment of Lycurgus, for a well-conducted and happy 
<A NAME="1044"></A>state.
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR><BR>Agesilaus being now in years, gave over all military employments; 
<A NAME="1046"></A>but his son, Archidamus, having received help from Dionysius of Sicily, 
<A NAME="1047"></A>gave a great defeat to the Arcadians, in the fight known by the name of 
<A NAME="1048"></A>the Tearless Battle, in which there was a great slaughter of the enemy 
<A NAME="1049"></A>without the loss of one Spartan. Yet this victory, more than anything else, 
<A NAME="1050"></A>discovered the present weakness of Sparta; for heretofore victory was esteemed 
<A NAME="1051"></A>so usual a thing with them that for their greatest successes they merely 
<A NAME="1052"></A>sacrificed a cock to the gods. The soldiers never vaunted, nor did the 
<A NAME="1053"></A>citizens display any great joy at the news; even when the great victory, 
<A NAME="1054"></A>described by Thucydides, was obtained at Mantinea, the messenger that brought 
<A NAME="1055"></A>the news had no other reward than a piece of meat, sent by the magistrates 
<A NAME="1056"></A>from the common table. But at the news of this Arcadian victory they were 
<A NAME="1057"></A>not able to contain themselves; Agesilaus went out in procession with tears 
<A NAME="1058"></A>of joy in his eyes to meet and embrace his son, and all the magistrates 
<A NAME="1059"></A>and public officers attended him. The old men and the women marched out 
<A NAME="1060"></A>as far as the river Eurotas, lifting up their hands, and thanking the gods 
<A NAME="1061"></A>that Sparta was now cleared again of the disgrace and indignity that had 
<A NAME="1062"></A>befallen her, and once more saw the light of day. Since before, they tell 
<A NAME="1063"></A>us, the Spartan men, out of shame at their disasters, did not dare so much 
<A NAME="1064"></A>as to look their wives in the face.
<A NAME="1065"></A><BR><BR>When Epaminondas restored Messene, and recalled from all quarters 
<A NAME="1066"></A>the ancient citizens to inhabit it, they were not able to obstruct the 
<A NAME="1067"></A>design, being not in condition of appearing in the field against them. 
<A NAME="1068"></A>But it went greatly against Agesilaus in the minds of his countrymen, when 
<A NAME="1069"></A>they found so large a territory, equal to their own in compass, and for 
<A NAME="1070"></A>fertility the richest of all Greece, which they had enjoyed so long, taken 
<A NAME="1071"></A>from them in his reign. Therefore it was that the king broke off treaty 
<A NAME="1072"></A>with the Thebans when they offered him peace, rather than set his hand 
<A NAME="1073"></A>to the passing away of that country, though it was already taken from him. 
<A NAME="1074"></A>Which point of honour had like to have cost him dear; for not long after 
<A NAME="1075"></A>he was overreached by a stratagem, which had almost amounted to the loss 
<A NAME="1076"></A>of Sparta. For when the Mantineans again revolted from Thebes to Sparta, 
<A NAME="1077"></A>and Epaminondas understood that Agesilaus was come to their assistance 
<A NAME="1078"></A>with a powerful army, he privately in the night quitted his quarters of 
<A NAME="1079"></A>Tegea, and, unknown to the Mantineans, passing by Agesilaus, marched toward 
<A NAME="1080"></A>Sparta, insomuch that he failed very little of taking it empty and 
<A NAME="1081"></A>unarmed.
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR><BR>Agesilaus had intelligence sent him by Euthynus, the Thespian, 
<A NAME="1083"></A>as Callisthenes says, but Xenophon says by a Cretan; and immediately despatched 
<A NAME="1084"></A>a horseman to Lacedaemon to apprise them of it, and to let them know that 
<A NAME="1085"></A>he was hastening to them. Shortly after his arrival the Thebans
