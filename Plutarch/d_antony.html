<A NAME="1"></A><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>The Comparison of Demetrius and Antony</B></FONT>
<A NAME="2"></A><BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>As both are great examples of the vicissitudes of fortune, let us first 
<A NAME="11"></A>consider in what way they attained their power and glory. Demetrius hired 
<A NAME="12"></A>a kingdom already won for him by Antigonus, the most powerful of the Successors, 
<A NAME="13"></A>who, before Demetrius grew to be a man, traversed with his armies and subdued 
<A NAME="14"></A>the greater part of Asia. Antony's father was well enough in other respects, 
<A NAME="15"></A>but was no warrior, and could bequeath no great legacy of reputation to 
<A NAME="16"></A>his son, who had the boldness, nevertheless, to take upon him the government, 
<A NAME="17"></A>to which birth give him no claim, which had been held by Caesar, and became 
<A NAME="18"></A>the inheritor of his great labours. And such power did he attain, with 
<A NAME="19"></A>only himself to thank for it, that, in a division of the whole empire into 
<A NAME="20"></A>two portions, he took and received the nobler one; and, absent himself, 
<A NAME="21"></A>by his mere subalterns and lieutenants often defeated the Parthians, and 
<A NAME="22"></A>drove the barbarous nations of the Caucasus back to the Caspian Sea. Those 
<A NAME="23"></A>very things that procured him ill-repute bear witness to his greatness. 
<A NAME="24"></A>Antigonus considered Antipater's daughter Phila, in spite of the disparity 
<A NAME="25"></A>of her years, an advantageous match for Demetrius. Antony was thought disgraced 
<A NAME="26"></A>by his marriage with Cleopatra, a queen superior in power and glory to 
<A NAME="27"></A>all, except Arsaces, who were kings in her time. Antony was so great as 
<A NAME="28"></A>to be thought by others worthy of higher things than his own 
<A NAME="29"></A>desires.
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>As regards the right and justice of their aims at empire, Demetrius 
<A NAME="31"></A>need not be blamed for seeking to rule a people that had always had a king 
<A NAME="32"></A>to rule them. Antony, who enslaved the Roman people, just liberated from 
<A NAME="33"></A>the rule of Caesar, followed a cruel and tyrannical object. His greatest 
<A NAME="34"></A>and most illustrious work, his successful war with Brutus and Cassius, 
<A NAME="35"></A>was done to crush the liberties of his country and of his fellow-citizens. 
<A NAME="36"></A>Demetrius, till he was driven to extremity, went on, without intermission, 
<A NAME="37"></A>maintaining liberty in Greece, and expelling the foreign garrisons from 
<A NAME="38"></A>the cities; not like Antony, whose boast was to have slain in Macedonia 
<A NAME="39"></A>those who had set up liberty in Rome. As for the profusion and magnificence 
<A NAME="40"></A>of his gifts, one point for which Antony is lauded, Demetrius so far outdid 
<A NAME="41"></A>them that what he gave to his enemies was far more than Antony ever gave 
<A NAME="42"></A>to his friends. Antony was renowned for giving Brutus honourable burial; 
<A NAME="43"></A>Demetrius did so to all the enemy's dead, and sent the prisoners back to 
<A NAME="44"></A>Ptolemy with money and presents.
<A NAME="45"></A><BR><BR>Both were insolent in prosperity, and abandoned themselves to luxuries 
<A NAME="46"></A>and enjoyments. Yet it cannot be said that Demetrius, in his revellings 
<A NAME="47"></A>and dissipations, ever let slip the time for action; pleasures with him 
<A NAME="48"></A>attended only the superabundance of his ease, and his Lamia, like that 
<A NAME="49"></A>of the fable, belonging only to his playful, half-waking, half-sleeping 
<A NAME="50"></A>hours. When war demanded his attention, his spear was not wreathed with 
<A NAME="51"></A>ivy, nor his helmet redolent of unguents; he did not come out to battle 
<A NAME="52"></A>from the women's chamber, but, bushing the bacchanal shouts and putting 
<A NAME="53"></A>an end to the orgies, he became at once, as Euripides calls it, "the minister 
<A NAME="54"></A>of the unpriestly Mars; and, in short, he never once incurred disaster 
<A NAME="55"></A>through indolence or self-indulgence. Whereas Antony, like Hercules in 
<A NAME="56"></A>the picture where Omphale is seen removing his club and stripping him of 
<A NAME="57"></A>his lion's skin, was over and over again disarmed by Cleopatra, and beguiled 
<A NAME="58"></A>away, while great actions and enterprises of the first necessity fell, 
<A NAME="59"></A>as it were, from his hands, to go with her to the seashore of Canopus and 
<A NAME="60"></A>Taphosiris, and play about. And in the end, like another Paris, he left 
<A NAME="61"></A>the battle to fly to her arms; or rather, to say the truth, Paris fled 
<A NAME="62"></A>when he was already beaten; Antony fled first, and, following Cleopatra, 
<A NAME="63"></A>abandoned his victory.
<A NAME="64"></A><BR><BR>There was no law to prevent Demetrius from marrying several wives; 
<A NAME="65"></A>from the time of Philip and Alexander it had become usual with Macedonian 
<A NAME="66"></A>kings, and he did no more than was done by Lysimachus and Ptolemy. And 
<A NAME="67"></A>those he married he treated honourably. But Antony, first of all, in marrying 
<A NAME="68"></A>two wives at once, did a thing which no Roman had ever allowed himself; 
<A NAME="69"></A>and then he drove away his lawful Roman wife to please the foreign and 
<A NAME="70"></A>unlawful woman. And so Demetrius incurred no harm at all; Antony procured 
<A NAME="71"></A>his ruin by his marriage. On the other hand, no licentious act of Antony's 
<A NAME="72"></A>can be charged with that impiety which marks those of Demetrius. Historical 
<A NAME="73"></A>writers tell us that the very dogs are excluded from the whole Acropolis 
<A NAME="74"></A>because of their gross, uncleanly habits. The very Parthenon itself saw 
<A NAME="75"></A>Demetrius consorting with harlots and debauching free women of Athens. 
<A NAME="76"></A>The vice of cruelty, also, remote as it seems from the indulgence of voluptuous 
<A NAME="77"></A>desires, must be attributed to him, who, in the pursuit of his pleasures, 
<A NAME="78"></A>allowed or, to say more truly, compelled the death of the most beautiful 
<A NAME="79"></A>and most chaste of the Athenians, who found no way but this to escape his 
<A NAME="80"></A>violence. In one word, Antony himself suffered by his excesses, and other 
<A NAME="81"></A>people by those of Demetrius.
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR>In his conduct to his parents, Demetrius was irreproachable. Antony 
<A NAME="83"></A>gave up his mother's brother, in order that he might have leave to kill 
<A NAME="84"></A>Cicero, this itself being so cruel and shocking an act that Antony would 
<A NAME="85"></A>hardly be forgiven if Cicero's death had been the price of this uncle's 
<A NAME="86"></A>safety. In respect of breaches of oaths and treaties, the seizure of Artabazes, 
<A NAME="87"></A>and the assassination of Alexander, Antony may urge the plea which no one 
<A NAME="88"></A>denies to be true, that Artabazes first abandoned and betrayed him in Media; 
<A NAME="89"></A>Demetrius is alleged by many to have invented false pretexts for his act, 
<A NAME="90"></A>and not to have retaliated for injuries, but to have accused one whom he 
<A NAME="91"></A>injured himself.
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR>The achievements of Demetrius are all his own work. Antony's noblest 
<A NAME="93"></A>and greatest victories were won in his absence by his lieutenants. For 
<A NAME="94"></A>their final disasters they have both only to thank themselves; not, however, 
<A NAME="95"></A>in an equal degree. Demetrius was deserted, the Macedonians revolted from 
<A NAME="96"></A>him; Antony deserted others, and ran away while men were fighting for him 
<A NAME="97"></A>at the risk of their lives. The fault to be found with the one is that 
<A NAME="98"></A>he had thus entirely alienated the affections of his soldiers; the other's 
<A NAME="99"></A>condemnation is that he abandoned so much love and faith as he still possessed. 
<A NAME="100"></A>We cannot admire the death of either, but that of Demetrius excites our 
<A NAME="101"></A>greater contempt. He let himself become a prisoner, and was thankful to 
<A NAME="102"></A>gain a three years' accession of life in captivity. He was tamed like a 
<A NAME="103"></A>wild beast by his belly, and by wine; Antony took himself out of the world 
<A NAME="104"></A>in a cowardly, pitiful, and ignoble manner, but still in time to prevent 
<A NAME="105"></A>the enemy having his person in their power.
