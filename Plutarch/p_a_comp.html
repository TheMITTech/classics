<A NAME="2"></A><BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Thus having drawn out the history of the lives of Agesilaus and Pompey, 
<A NAME="11"></A>the next thing is to compare them; and in order to this, to take a cursory 
<A NAME="12"></A>view, and bring together the points in which they chiefly disagree; which 
<A NAME="13"></A>are these. In the first place, Pompey attained to all his greatness and 
<A NAME="14"></A>glory by the fairest and justest means, owing his advancement to his own 
<A NAME="15"></A>efforts, and to the frequent and important aid which he rendered Sylla, 
<A NAME="16"></A>in delivering Italy from its tyrants. But Agesilaus appears to have obtained 
<A NAME="17"></A>his kingdom, not without offence both towards gods and towards men, towards 
<A NAME="18"></A>these, by procuring judgment of bastardy against Leotychides, whom his 
<A NAME="19"></A>brother had declared his lawful son, and towards those, by putting a false 
<A NAME="20"></A>gloss upon the oracle, and eluding its sentence against his lameness. Secondly, 
<A NAME="21"></A>Pompey never ceased to display his respect for Sylla during his lifetime, 
<A NAME="22"></A>and expressed it also after his death, by enforcing the honourable interment 
<A NAME="23"></A>of his corpse, in despite of Lepidus, and by giving his daughter in marriage 
<A NAME="24"></A>to his son Faustus. But Agesilaus, upon a slight pretence, cast off Lysander 
<A NAME="25"></A>with reproach and dishonour. Yet Sylla in fact had owed to Pompey services 
<A NAME="26"></A>as much as Pompey ever received from him, whereas Lysander made Agesilaus 
<A NAME="27"></A>King of Sparta and general of all Greece. Thirdly, Pompey's transgressions 
<A NAME="28"></A>of right and justice in his political life were occasioned chiefly by his 
<A NAME="29"></A>relations with other people, and most of his errors had some affinity, 
<A NAME="30"></A>as well as himself to Caesar and Scipio, his fathers-in-law. But Agesilaus, 
<A NAME="31"></A>to gratify the fondness of his son, saved the life of Sphodrias by a sort 
<A NAME="32"></A>of violence, when he deserved death for the wrong he had done to the Athenians; 
<A NAME="33"></A>and when Phoebidas treacherously broke the peace with Thebes, zealously 
<A NAME="34"></A>abetted him for the sake, it was clear, of the unjust act itself. In short, 
<A NAME="35"></A>what mischief soever Pompey might be said to have brought on Rome through 
<A NAME="36"></A>compliance with the wishes of his friends or through inadvertency, Agesilaus 
<A NAME="37"></A>may be said to have brought on Sparta out of obstinacy and malice, by kindling 
<A NAME="38"></A>the Boeotian war. And if, moreover, we are to attribute any part of these 
<A NAME="39"></A>disasters to some personal ill-fortune, attaching to the men themselves, 
<A NAME="40"></A>in the case of Pompey, certainly the Romans had no reason to anticipate 
<A NAME="41"></A>it. Whereas Agesilaus would not suffer the Lacedaemonians to avoid what 
<A NAME="42"></A>they foresaw and were forewarned must attend the "lame sovereignty." For 
<A NAME="43"></A>had Leotychides been chargeable ten thousand times as foreign and spurious, 
<A NAME="44"></A>yet the race of the Eurypontidae was still in being, and could easily have 
<A NAME="45"></A>furnished Sparta with a lawful king that was sound in his limbs, had not 
<A NAME="46"></A>Lysander darkened and disguised the true sense of the oracle in favour 
<A NAME="47"></A>of Agesilaus.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>Such a politic piece of sophistry as was devised by Agesilaus, 
<A NAME="49"></A>in that great perplexity of the people as to the treatment to be given 
<A NAME="50"></A>to those who had played the coward at the battle of Leuctra, when after 
<A NAME="51"></A>that unhappy defeat he decreed that the laws should sleep for that day, 
<A NAME="52"></A>it would be hard to find any parallel to; neither have we the fellow of 
<A NAME="53"></A>it in all Pompey's story. But on the contrary, Pompey for a friend thought 
<A NAME="54"></A>it no sin to break those very laws which he himself had made, as if to 
<A NAME="55"></A>show at once the force of his friendship, and the greatness of his power; 
<A NAME="56"></A>whereas Agesilaus, under the necessity, as it seemed, of either rescinding 
<A NAME="57"></A>the laws, or not saving the citizens, contrived an expedient by the help 
<A NAME="58"></A>of which the laws should not touch these citizens, and yet should not, 
<A NAME="59"></A>to avoid it, be overthrown. Then I must commend it as an incomparable act 
<A NAME="60"></A>of civil virtue and obedience in Agesilaus, that immediately upon the receipt 
<A NAME="61"></A>of the scytala, he left the wars in Asia and returned into his country. 
<A NAME="62"></A>For he did not, like Pompey, merely advance his country's interest by acts 
<A NAME="63"></A>that contributed at the same time to promote his own greatness, but looking 
<A NAME="64"></A>to his country's good, for its sake laid aside as great authority and honour 
<A NAME="65"></A>as ever any man had before or since, except Alexander the 
<A NAME="66"></A>Great.
<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR>But now to take another point of view, if we sum up Pompey's military 
<A NAME="68"></A>expeditions and exploits of war, the number of his trophies, and the greatness 
<A NAME="69"></A>of the powers which he subdued, and the multitude of battles in which he 
<A NAME="70"></A>triumphed, I am persuaded even Xenophon himself would not put the victories 
<A NAME="71"></A>of Agesilaus in balance with his, though Xenophon has this privilege allowed 
<A NAME="72"></A>him, as a sort of special reward for his other excellences, that he may 
<A NAME="73"></A>write and speak, in favour of his hero, whatever he pleases. Methinks, 
<A NAME="74"></A>too, there is  a great deal of difference betwixt these men in their clemency 
<A NAME="75"></A>and moderation towards their enemies. For Agesilaus, while attempting to 
<A NAME="76"></A>enslave Thebes and exterminate Messene, the latter, his country's ancient 
<A NAME="77"></A>associate, and Thebes, the mother-city of his own royal house, almost lost 
<A NAME="78"></A>Sparta itself, and did really lose the government of Greece; whereas Pompey 
<A NAME="79"></A>gave cities to those of the pirates who were willing to change their manner 
<A NAME="80"></A>of life; and when it was in his power to lead Tigranes, King of Armenia, 
<A NAME="81"></A>in triumph, he chose rather to make him a confederate of the Romans, saying, 
<A NAME="82"></A>that a single day was worth less than all future time. But if the pre-eminence 
<A NAME="83"></A>in that which relates to the office and virtues of a general should be 
<A NAME="84"></A>determined by the greatest and most important acts and counsels of war, 
<A NAME="85"></A>the Lacedaemonian would not a little exceed the Roman. For Agesilaus never 
<A NAME="86"></A>deserted his city, though it was besieged by an army of seventy thousand 
<A NAME="87"></A>men, when there were very few soldiers within to defend it, and those had 
<A NAME="88"></A>been defeated too, but a little before, at the battle of Leuctra. But Pompey, 
<A NAME="89"></A>when Caesar, with a body only of fifty-three hundred men, had taken but 
<A NAME="90"></A>one town in Italy, departed in a panic out of Rome, either through cowardice, 
<A NAME="91"></A>when there were so few, or at least through a false and mistaken belief 
<A NAME="92"></A>that there were more; and having conveyed away his wife and children, he 
<A NAME="93"></A>left all the rest of the citizens defenceless, and fled; whereas he ought 
<A NAME="94"></A>either to have conquered in fight for the defence of his country, or yielded 
<A NAME="95"></A>upon terms to the conqueror, who was, moreover, his fellow-citizen and 
<A NAME="96"></A>allied to him; but now to the same man to whom he refused a prolongation 
<A NAME="97"></A>of the terms of his government, and thought it intolerable to grant another 
<A NAME="98"></A>consulship, to him he gave the power, by letting him take the city, to 
<A NAME="99"></A>tell Metellus, together with all the rest, that they were his 
<A NAME="100"></A>prisoners.
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR>That which is chiefly the office of a general, to force the enemy 
<A NAME="102"></A>into fighting when he finds himself the stronger, and to avoid being driven 
<A NAME="103"></A>into it himself when he is the weaker, this excellence Agesilaus always 
<A NAME="104"></A>displayed, and by it kept himself invincible; whereas in contending with 
<A NAME="105"></A>Pompey, Caesar, who was the weaker, successfully declined the danger, and 
<A NAME="106"></A>his own strength being in his land-forces, drove him into putting the conflict 
<A NAME="107"></A>to issue with these, and thus made himself master of the treasure, stores, 
<A NAME="108"></A>and the sea too, which were all in his enemy's hands, and by the help of 
<A NAME="109"></A>which the victory could have been secured without fighting. And what is 
<A NAME="110"></A>alleged as an apology in vindication of Pompey, is to a general of his 
<A NAME="111"></A>age and standing the greatest of disgraces. For, granting that a young 
<A NAME="112"></A>commander might by clamour and outcry be deprived of his fortitude and 
<A NAME="113"></A>strength of mind, and weakly forsake his better judgment, and the thing 
<A NAME="114"></A>be neither strange nor altogether unpardonable, yet for Pompey the Great, 
<A NAME="115"></A>whose camp the Romans called their country, and his tent the senate, styling 
<A NAME="116"></A>the consuls, praetors, and all other magistrates who were conducting the 
<A NAME="117"></A>government at Rome by no better title than that of rebels and traitors, 
<A NAME="118"></A>for him, whom they well knew never to have been under the command of any 
<A NAME="119"></A>but himself, having served all his campaigns under himself as sole general, 
<A NAME="120"></A>for him upon so small a provocation as the scoffs of Favonius and Domitius, 
<A NAME="121"></A>and lest he should bear the nickname of Agamemnon, to be wrought upon, 
<A NAME="122"></A>and even forced to hazard the whole empire and liberty of Rome upon the 
<A NAME="123"></A>cast of a die, was surely indeed intolerable. Who, if he had so much regarded 
<A NAME="124"></A>a present infamy, should have guarded the city at first with his arms, 
<A NAME="125"></A>and fought the battle in defence of Rome, not have left it as he did: nor 
<A NAME="126"></A>while declaring his flight from Italy an artifice in the manner of Themistocles, 
<A NAME="127"></A>nevertheless be ashamed in Thessaly of a prudent delay before engaging. 
<A NAME="128"></A>Heaven had not appointed the Pharsalian fields to be the stage and theatre 
<A NAME="129"></A>upon which they should contend for the empire of Rome, neither was he summoned 
<A NAME="130"></A>thither by any herald upon challenge, with intimation that he must either 
<A NAME="131"></A>undergo the combat or surrender the prize to another. There were many other 
<A NAME="132"></A>fields, thousands of cities, and even the whole earth placed at his command, 
<A NAME="133"></A>by the advantage of his fleet and his superiority at sea, if he would but 
<A NAME="134"></A>have followed the examples of Maximus, Marius, Lucullus, and even Agesilaus 
<A NAME="135"></A>himself, who endured no less tumults within the city of Sparta, when the 
<A NAME="136"></A>Thebans provoked him to come out and fight in defence of the land, and 
<A NAME="137"></A>sustained in Egypt also numerous calumnies, slanders, and suspicions on 
<A NAME="138"></A>the part of the king, whom he counselled to abstain from a battle. And 
<A NAME="139"></A>thus following always what he had determined in his own judgment upon mature 
<A NAME="140"></A>advice, by that means he not only preserved the Egyptians against their 
<A NAME="141"></A>wills, not only kept Sparta, in those desperate convulsions, by his sole 
<A NAME="142"></A>act, safe from overthrow, but even was able to set up trophies likewise 
<A NAME="143"></A>in the city over the Thebans, having given his countrymen an occasion of 
<A NAME="144"></A>being victorious afterwards by not at first leading them out, as they tried 
<A NAME="145"></A>to force him to do, to their own destruction. The consequence was that 
<A NAME="146"></A>in the end Agesilaus was commended by the very men, when they found themselves 
<A NAME="147"></A>saved, upon whom he had put this compulsion, whereas Pompey, whose error 
<A NAME="148"></A>had been occasioned by others, found those his accusers whose advice had 
<A NAME="149"></A>misled him. Some indeed profess that he was deceived by his father-in-law 
<A NAME="150"></A>Scipio, who, designing to conceal and keep to himself the greatest part 
<A NAME="151"></A>of that treasure which he had brought out of Asia, pressed Pompey to battle, 
<A NAME="152"></A>upon the pretence that there would be a want of money. Yet admitting he 
<A NAME="153"></A>was deceived, one in his place ought not to have been so, nor should have 
<A NAME="154"></A>allowed so slight an artifice to cause the hazard of such mighty interests. 
<A NAME="155"></A>And thus we have taken a view of each, by comparing together their conduct 
<A NAME="156"></A>and actions in war.
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR>As to their voyages into Egypt, one steered his course thither 
<A NAME="158"></A>out of necessity in flight; the other neither honourably, nor of necessity, 
<A NAME="159"></A>but as a mercenary soldier, having enlisted himself into the service of 
<A NAME="160"></A>a barbarous nation for pay, that he might be able afterwards to wage war 
<A NAME="161"></A>upon the Greeks. And secondly, what we charge upon the Egyptians in the 
<A NAME="162"></A>name of Pompey, the Egyptians lay to the charge of Agesilaus. Pompey trusted 
<A NAME="163"></A>them and was betrayed and murdered by them; Agesilaus accepted their confidence 
<A NAME="164"></A>and deserted them, transferring his aid to the very enemies who were now 
<A NAME="165"></A>attacking those whom he had been brought over to assist.
