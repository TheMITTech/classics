<A NAME="2"></A>
<BR>(legendary, lived 500 B.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Such was Solon. To him we compare Poplicola, who received this later title 
<A NAME="11"></A>from the Roman people for his merit, as a noble accession to his former 
<A NAME="12"></A>name, Publius Valerius. He descended from Valerius, a man amongst the early 
<A NAME="13"></A>citizens, reputed the principal reconciler of the differences betwixt the 
<A NAME="14"></A>Romans and Sabines, and one that was most instrumental in persuading their 
<A NAME="15"></A>kings to assent to peace and union. Thus descended, Publius Valerius, as 
<A NAME="16"></A>it is said, whilst Rome remained under its kingly government, obtained 
<A NAME="17"></A>as great a name from his eloquence as from his riches, charitably employing 
<A NAME="18"></A>the one in liberal aid to the poor, the other with integrity and freedom 
<A NAME="19"></A>in the service of justice thereby giving assurance, that, should the government 
<A NAME="20"></A>fall into a republic, he would become a chief man in the community. The 
<A NAME="21"></A>illegal and wicked accession of Tarquinius Superbus to the crown, with 
<A NAME="22"></A>his making it, instead of kingly rule, the instrument of insolence and 
<A NAME="23"></A>tyranny, having inspired the people with a hatred to his reign, upon the 
<A NAME="24"></A>death of Lucretia (she killing herself after violence had been done to 
<A NAME="25"></A>her), they took an occasion of revolt; and Lucius Brutus, engaging in the 
<A NAME="26"></A>change, came to Valerius before all others, and, with his zealous assistance, 
<A NAME="27"></A>deposed the kings. And whilst the people inclined towards the electing 
<A NAME="28"></A>one leader instead of their king, Valerius acquiesced, that to rule was 
<A NAME="29"></A>rather Brutus's due, as the author of the democracy. But when the name 
<A NAME="30"></A>of monarchy was odious to the people, and a divided power appeared more 
<A NAME="31"></A>grateful in the prospect, and two were chosen to hold it, Valerius, entertaining 
<A NAME="32"></A>hopes that he might be elected consul with Brutus, was disappointed; for, 
<A NAME="33"></A>instead of Valerius, notwithstanding the endeavours of Brutus, Tarquinius 
<A NAME="34"></A>Collatinus was chosen, the husband of Lucretia, a man noways his superior 
<A NAME="35"></A>in merit. But the nobles dreading the return of their kings, who still 
<A NAME="36"></A>used all endeavours abroad and solicitations at home, were resolved upon 
<A NAME="37"></A>a chieftain of an intense hatred to them, and noways likely to 
<A NAME="38"></A>yield.
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR>Now Valerius was troubled that his desire to serve his country 
<A NAME="40"></A>should be doubted, because he had sustained no private injury from the 
<A NAME="41"></A>insolence of the tyrants. He withdrew from the senate and practice of the 
<A NAME="42"></A>bar, quitting all public concerns; which gave an occasion of discourse, 
<A NAME="43"></A>and fear, too, lest his anger should reconcile him to the king's side, 
<A NAME="44"></A>and he should prove the ruin of the state, tottering as yet under the uncertainties 
<A NAME="45"></A>of a change. But Brutus being doubtful of some others, and determined to 
<A NAME="46"></A>give the test to the senate upon the altars, upon the day appointed Valerius 
<A NAME="47"></A>came with cheerfulness into the forum, and was the first man that took 
<A NAME="48"></A>the oath, in no way to submit or yield to Tarquin's propositions, but rigorously 
<A NAME="49"></A>to maintain liberty; which gave great satisfaction to the senate and assurance 
<A NAME="50"></A>to the consuls, his action soon after showing the sincerity of his oath. 
<A NAME="51"></A>For ambassadors came from Tarquin, with popular and specious proposals, 
<A NAME="52"></A>whereby they thought to seduce the people, as though the king had cast 
<A NAME="53"></A>off all insolence, and made moderation the only measure of his desires. 
<A NAME="54"></A>To this embassy the consuls thought fit to give public audience, but Valerius 
<A NAME="55"></A>opposed it, and would not permit that the poorer people, who entertained 
<A NAME="56"></A>more fear of war than of tyranny, should have any occasion offered them, 
<A NAME="57"></A>or any temptations to new designs. Afterwards other ambassadors arrived, 
<A NAME="58"></A>who declared their king would recede from his crown, and lay down his arms, 
<A NAME="59"></A>only capitulating for a restitution to himself, his friends, and allies, 
<A NAME="60"></A>of their moneys and estates to support them in their banishment. Now, several 
<A NAME="61"></A>inclining to the request, and Collatinus in particular favouring it, Brutus, 
<A NAME="62"></A>a man of vehement and unbending nature, rushed into the forum, there proclaiming 
<A NAME="63"></A>his fellow-consul to be a traitor, in granting subsidies to tyranny, and 
<A NAME="64"></A>supplies for a war to those to whom it was monstrous to allow so much as 
<A NAME="65"></A>subsistence in exile. This caused an assembly of the citizens, amongst 
<A NAME="66"></A>whom the first that spake was Caius Minucius, a private man, who advised 
<A NAME="67"></A>Brutus, and urged the Romans to keep the property, and employ it against 
<A NAME="68"></A>the tyrants, rather than to remit it to the tyrants, to be used against 
<A NAME="69"></A>themselves. The Romans, however, decided that whilst they had enjoyed the 
<A NAME="70"></A>liberty they had fought for, they should not sacrifice peace for the sake 
<A NAME="71"></A>of money, but send out the tyrants' property after them. This question, 
<A NAME="72"></A>however, of his property was the least part of Tarquin's design; the demand 
<A NAME="73"></A>sounded the feelings of the people, and was preparatory to a conspiracy 
<A NAME="74"></A>which the ambassadors endeavoured to excite, delaying their return, under 
<A NAME="75"></A>pretence of selling some of the goods and reserving others to be sent away, 
<A NAME="76"></A>till, in fine, they corrupted two of the most eminent families in Rome, 
<A NAME="77"></A>the Aquillian, which had three, and the Vitellian, which had two senators. 
<A NAME="78"></A>These all were, by the mother's side, nephews to Collatinus; besides which 
<A NAME="79"></A>Brutus had a special alliance to the Vitellii from his marriage with their 
<A NAME="80"></A>sister, by whom he had several children; two of whom, of their own age, 
<A NAME="81"></A>their near relations and daily companions, the Vitellii seduced to join 
<A NAME="82"></A>in the plot, to ally themselves to the great house and royal hopes of the 
<A NAME="83"></A>Tarquins, and gain emancipation from the violence and imbecility united 
<A NAME="84"></A>of their father, whose austerity to offenders they termed violence, while 
<A NAME="85"></A>the imbecility which he had long feigned, to protect himself from the tyrants, 
<A NAME="86"></A>still, it appears, was, in name at least, ascribed to him. When upon these 
<A NAME="87"></A>inducements the youths came to confer with the Aquillii, and thought it 
<A NAME="88"></A>convenient to bind themselves in a solemn and dreadful oath, by tasting 
<A NAME="89"></A>the blood of a murdered man, and touching his entrails. For which design 
<A NAME="90"></A>they met at the house of the Aquillii. The building chosen for the transaction 
<A NAME="91"></A>was, as was natural, dark and unfrequented, and a slave named Vindicius 
<A NAME="92"></A>had, as it chanced, concealed himself there, not out of design or any intelligence 
<A NAME="93"></A>of the affair, but, accidentally being within, seeing with how much haste 
<A NAME="94"></A>and concern they came in, he was afraid to be discovered, and placed himself 
<A NAME="95"></A>behind a chest, where he was able to observe their actions and overhear 
<A NAME="96"></A>their debates. Their resolutions were to kill the consuls, and they wrote 
<A NAME="97"></A>letters to Tarquin to this effect, and gave them to the ambassadors, who 
<A NAME="98"></A>were lodging upon the spot with the Aquillii, and were present at the 
<A NAME="99"></A>consultation.
<A NAME="100"></A><BR><BR>Upon their departure, Vindicius secretly quitted the house, but 
<A NAME="101"></A>was at a loss what to do in the matter, for to arraign the sons before 
<A NAME="102"></A>the father Brutus, or the nephews before the uncle Collatinus, seemed equally 
<A NAME="103"></A>(as indeed it was) shocking; yet he knew no private Roman to whom he could 
<A NAME="104"></A>intrust secrets of such importance. Unable, however, to keep silence, and 
<A NAME="105"></A>burdened with his knowledge, he went and addressed himself to Valerius, 
<A NAME="106"></A>whose known freedom and kindness of temper were an inducement; as he was 
<A NAME="107"></A>a person to whom the needy had easy access, and who never shut his gates 
<A NAME="108"></A>against the petitions or indigences of humble people. But when Vindicius 
<A NAME="109"></A>came and made a complete discovery to him, his brother Marcus and his own 
<A NAME="110"></A>wife being present, Valerius was struck with amazement, and by no means 
<A NAME="111"></A>would dismiss the discoverer, but confined him to the room, and placed 
<A NAME="112"></A>his wife as a guard to the door, sending his brother in the interim to 
<A NAME="113"></A>beset the king's palace, and seize, if possible, the writings there, and 
<A NAME="114"></A>secure the domestics, whilst he, with his constant attendance of clients 
<A NAME="115"></A>and friends, and a great retinue of attendants, repaired to the house of 
<A NAME="116"></A>the Aquillii, who were, as it chanced, absent from home; and so, forcing 
<A NAME="117"></A>an entrance through the gates, they lit upon the letters then lying in 
<A NAME="118"></A>the lodgings of the ambassadors. Meantime the Aquillii returned in all 
<A NAME="119"></A>haste, and, coming to blows about the gate, endeavoured a recovery of the 
<A NAME="120"></A>letters. The other party made a resistance, and throwing their gowns around 
<A NAME="121"></A>their opponents' necks, at last, after much struggling on both sides, made 
<A NAME="122"></A>their way with them their prisoners through the streets into the forum. 
<A NAME="123"></A>The like engagement happened about the king's palace, where Marcus seized 
<A NAME="124"></A>some other letters which it was designed should be conveyed away in the 
<A NAME="125"></A>goods, and, laying hands on such of the king's people as he could find, 
<A NAME="126"></A>dragged them also into the forum. When the consuls had quieted the tumult, 
<A NAME="127"></A>Vindicius was brought out by the orders of Valerius, and the accusation 
<A NAME="128"></A>stated, and the letters were opened, to which the traitors could make no 
<A NAME="129"></A>plea. Most of the people standing mute and sorrowful, some only, out of 
<A NAME="130"></A>kindness to Brutus, mentioning banishment, the tears of Collatinus, attended 
<A NAME="131"></A>with Valerius's silence, gave some hopes of mercy. But Brutus, calling 
<A NAME="132"></A>his two sons by their names, "Canst not thou," said he, "O Titus, or thou, 
<A NAME="133"></A>Tiberius, make any defence against the indictment?" The question being 
<A NAME="134"></A>thrice proposed, and no reply made, he turned himself to the lictors and 
<A NAME="135"></A>cried, "What remains is your duty." They immediately seized the youths, 
<A NAME="136"></A>and, stripping them of their clothes, bound their hands behind them and 
<A NAME="137"></A>scourged their bodies with their rods; too tragical a scene for others 
<A NAME="138"></A>to look at; Brutus, however, is said not to have turned aside his face, 
<A NAME="139"></A>nor allowed the least glance of pity to soften and smooth his aspect of 
<A NAME="140"></A>rigour and austerity, but sternly watched his children suffer, even till 
<A NAME="141"></A>the lictors, extending them on the ground, cut off their heads with an 
<A NAME="142"></A>axe; then departed, committing the rest to the judgment of his colleague. 
<A NAME="143"></A>An action truly open alike to the highest commendation and the strongest 
<A NAME="144"></A>censure; for either the greatness of his virtue raised him above the impressions 
<A NAME="145"></A>of sorrow, or the extravagance of his misery took away all sense of it; 
<A NAME="146"></A>but neither seemed common, or the result of humanity, but either divine 
<A NAME="147"></A>or brutish. Yet it is more reasonable that our judgment should yield to 
<A NAME="148"></A>his reputation, than that his merit should suffer detraction by the weakness 
<A NAME="149"></A>of our judgment; in the Roman's opinion, Brutus did a greater work in the 
<A NAME="150"></A>establishment of the government than Romulus in the foundation of the 
<A NAME="151"></A>city.
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR>Upon Brutus's departure out of the forum, consternation, horror, 
<A NAME="153"></A>and silence for some time possessed all that reflected on what was done; 
<A NAME="154"></A>the easiness and tardiness, however, of Collatinus gave confidence to the 
<A NAME="155"></A>Aquillii to request some time to answer their charge, and that Vindicius, 
<A NAME="156"></A>their servant, should be remitted into their hands, and no longer harboured 
<A NAME="157"></A>amongst their accusers. The consul seemed inclined to their proposal, and 
<A NAME="158"></A>was proceeding to dissolve the assembly; but Valerius would not suffer 
<A NAME="159"></A>Vindicius, who was surrounded by his people, to be surrendered, nor the 
<A NAME="160"></A>meeting to withdraw without punishing the traitors; and at length laid 
<A NAME="161"></A>violent hands upon the Aquillii, and, calling Brutus to his assistance, 
<A NAME="162"></A>exclaimed against the unreasonable course of Collatinus, to impose upon 
<A NAME="163"></A>his colleague the necessity of taking away the lives of his own sons, and 
<A NAME="164"></A>yet have thoughts of gratifying some women with the lives of traitors and 
<A NAME="165"></A>public enemies. Collatinus, displeased at this, and commanding Vindicius 
<A NAME="166"></A>to be taken away, the lictors made their way through the crowd and seized 
<A NAME="167"></A>their man, and struck all who endeavoured a rescue. Valerius's friends 
<A NAME="168"></A>headed the resistance, and the people cried out for Brutus, who, returning, 
<A NAME="169"></A>on silence being made, told them he had been competent to pass sentence 
<A NAME="170"></A>by himself upon his own sons, but left the rest to the suffrages of the 
<A NAME="171"></A>free citizens: "Let every man speak that wishes, and persuade whom he can." 
<A NAME="172"></A>But there was no need of oratory, for, it being referred to the vote, they 
<A NAME="173"></A>were returned condemned by all the suffrages, and were accordingly 
<A NAME="174"></A>beheaded.
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR>Collatinus's relationship to the kings had, indeed, already rendered 
<A NAME="176"></A>him suspicious, and his second name, too, had made him obnoxious to the 
<A NAME="177"></A>people, who were loth to hear the very sound of Tarquin; but after this 
<A NAME="178"></A>had happened, perceiving himself an offence to every one, he relinquished 
<A NAME="179"></A>his charge and departed from the city. At the new elections in his room, 
<A NAME="180"></A>Valerius obtained, with high honour, the consulship, as a just reward of 
<A NAME="181"></A>his zeal; of which he thought Vindicius deserved a share, whom he made, 
<A NAME="182"></A>first of all freedmen, a citizen of Rome, and gave him the privilege of 
<A NAME="183"></A>voting in what tribe soever he was pleased to be enrolled; other freedmen 
<A NAME="184"></A>received the right of suffrage a long time after from Appius, who thus 
<A NAME="185"></A>courted popularity; and from this Vindicius, a perfect manumission is called 
<A NAME="186"></A>to this day vindicta. This done, the goods of the kings were exposed to 
<A NAME="187"></A>plunder, and the palace to ruin.
<A NAME="188"></A><BR><BR>The pleasantest part of the field of Mars, which Tarquin had owned, 
<A NAME="189"></A>was devoted to the service of that god; but, it happening to be harvest 
<A NAME="190"></A>season, and the sheaves yet being on the ground, they thought it not proper 
<A NAME="191"></A>to commit them to the flail, or unsanctify them with any use; and, therefore, 
<A NAME="192"></A>carrying them to the river-side, and trees withal that were cut down, they 
<A NAME="193"></A>cast all into the water, dedicating the soil, free from all occupation, 
<A NAME="194"></A>to the deity. Now, these thrown in, one upon another, and closing together, 
<A NAME="195"></A>the stream did not bear them far, but where the first were carried down 
<A NAME="196"></A>and came to a bottom, the remainder, finding no farther conveyance, were 
<A NAME="197"></A>stopped and interwoven one with another; the stream working the mass into 
<A NAME="198"></A>a firmness, and washing down fresh mud. This, settling there, became an 
<A NAME="199"></A>accession of matter, as well as cement, to the rubbish, insomuch that the 
<A NAME="200"></A>violence of the waters could not remove it, but forced and compressed it 
<A NAME="201"></A>all together. Thus its bulk and solidity gained it new subsidies, which 
<A NAME="202"></A>gave it extension enough to stop on its way most of what the stream brought 
<A NAME="203"></A>down. This is now a sacred island, lying by the city, adorned with the 
<A NAME="204"></A>temples of the gods, and walks, and is called in the Latin tongue inter 
<A NAME="205"></A>duos pontes. Though some say this did not happen at the dedication of Tarquin's 
<A NAME="206"></A>field, but in aftertimes, when Tarquinia, a vestal priestess, gave an adjacent 
<A NAME="207"></A>field to the public, and obtained great honours in consequence, as, amongst 
<A NAME="208"></A>the rest, that of all women her testimony alone should be received; she 
<A NAME="209"></A>had also the liberty to marry, but refused it; thus some tell the 
<A NAME="210"></A>story.
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR>Tarquin, despairing of a return to his kingdom by the conspiracy, 
<A NAME="212"></A>found a kind reception amongst the Tuscans, who, with a great army, proceeded 
<A NAME="213"></A>to restore him. The consuls headed the Romans against them, and made their 
<A NAME="214"></A>rendezvous in certain holy places, the one called the Arsian grove, the 
<A NAME="215"></A>other the Aesuvian meadow. When they came into action, Aruns, the son of 
<A NAME="216"></A>Tarquin, and Brutus, the Roman consul, not accidentally encountering each 
<A NAME="217"></A>other, but out of hatred and rage, the one to avenge tyranny and enmity 
<A NAME="218"></A>to his country, the other his banishment, set spurs to their horses, and, 
<A NAME="219"></A>engaging with more fury than forethought, disregarding their own security, 
<A NAME="220"></A>fell together in the combat. This dreadful onset hardly was followed by 
<A NAME="221"></A>a more favourable end; both armies, doing and receiving equal damage, were 
<A NAME="222"></A>separated by a storm. Valerius was much concerned, not knowing what the 
<A NAME="223"></A>result of the day was, and seeing his men as well dismayed at the sight 
<A NAME="224"></A>of their own dead, as rejoiced at the loss of the enemy; so apparently 
<A NAME="225"></A>equal in the number was the slaughter on either side. Each party, however, 
<A NAME="226"></A>felt surer of defeat from the actual sight of their own dead, than they 
<A NAME="227"></A>could feel of victory from conjecture about those of their adversaries. 
<A NAME="228"></A>The night being come (and such as one may presume must follow such a battle), 
<A NAME="229"></A>and the armies laid to rest, they say that the grove shook, and uttered 
<A NAME="230"></A>a voice, saying that the Tuscans had lost one man more than the Romans; 
<A NAME="231"></A>clearly a divine announcement; and the Romans at once received it with 
<A NAME="232"></A>shouts and expressions of joy; whilst the Tuscans, through fear and amazement, 
<A NAME="233"></A>deserted their tents, and were for the most part dispersed. The Romans, 
<A NAME="234"></A>falling upon the remainder, amounting to nearly five thousand, took them 
<A NAME="235"></A>prisoners, and plundered the camp; when they numbered the dead, they found 
<A NAME="236"></A>on the Tuscans' side eleven thousand and three hundred, exceeding their 
<A NAME="237"></A>own loss but by one man. This fight happened upon the last of February, 
<A NAME="238"></A>and Valerius triumphed in honour of it, being the first consul that drove 
<A NAME="239"></A>in with a four-horse chariot; which sight both appeared magnificent, and 
<A NAME="240"></A>was received with an admiration free from envy or offence (as some suggest) 
<A NAME="241"></A>on the part of the spectators; it would not otherwise have been continued 
<A NAME="242"></A>with so much eagerness and emulation through all the after ages. The people 
<A NAME="243"></A>applauded likewise the honours he did to his colleague, in adding to his 
<A NAME="244"></A>obsequies a funeral oration: which was so much liked by the Romans, and 
<A NAME="245"></A>found so good a reception, that it became customary for the best men to 
<A NAME="246"></A>celebrate the funerals of great citizens with speeches in their commendation; 
<A NAME="247"></A>and their antiquity in Rome is affirmed to be greater than in Greece, unless, 
<A NAME="248"></A>with the orator Anaximenes, we make Solon the first 
<A NAME="249"></A>author.
<A NAME="250"></A><BR><BR>Yet some part of Valerius's behaviour did give offence and disgust 
<A NAME="251"></A>to the people, because Brutus, whom they esteemed the father of their liberty, 
<A NAME="252"></A>had not presumed to rule without a colleague, but united one and then another 
<A NAME="253"></A>to him in his commission; while Valerius, they said, centering all authority 
<A NAME="254"></A>in himself, seemed not in any sense a successor to Brutus in the consulship, 
<A NAME="255"></A>but to Tarquin in the tyranny; he might make verbal harangues to Brutus's 
<A NAME="256"></A>memory, yet when he was attended with all the rods and axes, proceeding 
<A NAME="257"></A>down from a house than which the king's house that he had demolished had 
<A NAME="258"></A>not been statelier, those actions showed him an imitator of Tarquin. For, 
<A NAME="259"></A>indeed, his dwelling-house on the Velia was somewhat imposing in appearance, 
<A NAME="260"></A>hanging over the forum, and overlooking all transactions there; the access 
<A NAME="261"></A>to it was hard, and to see him far off coming down, a stately and royal 
<A NAME="262"></A>spectacle. But Valerius showed how well it were for men in power and great 
<A NAME="263"></A>offices to have ears that give admittance to truth before flattery; for 
<A NAME="264"></A>upon his friends telling him that he displeased the people, he contended 
<A NAME="265"></A>not, neither resented it, but while it was still night, sending for a number 
<A NAME="266"></A>of work-people, pulled down his house and levelled it with the ground; 
<A NAME="267"></A>so that in the morning the people, seeing and flocking together, expressed 
<A NAME="268"></A>their wonder and their respect for his magnanimity, and their sorrow, as 
<A NAME="269"></A>though it had been a human being, for the large and beautiful house which 
<A NAME="270"></A>was thus lost to them by an unfounded jealousy, while its owner, their 
<A NAME="271"></A>consul, without a roof of his own, had to beg a lodging with his friends. 
<A NAME="272"></A>For his friends received him, till a place the people gave him was furnished 
<A NAME="273"></A>with a house, though less stately than his own, where now stands the temple, 
<A NAME="274"></A>as it is called, of Vica Pota.
<A NAME="275"></A><BR><BR>He resolved to render the government, as well as himself, instead 
<A NAME="276"></A>of terrible, familiar and pleasant to the people, and parted the axes from 
<A NAME="277"></A>the rods, and always, upon his entrance into the assembly, lowered these 
<A NAME="278"></A>also to the people, to show, in the strongest way, the republican foundation 
<A NAME="279"></A>of the government; and this the consuls observe to this day. But the humility 
<A NAME="280"></A>of the man was but a means, not, as they thought, of lessening himself, 
<A NAME="281"></A>but merely to abate their envy by this moderation; for whatever he detracted 
<A NAME="282"></A>from his authority he added to his real power, the people still submitting 
<A NAME="283"></A>with satisfaction, which they expressed by calling him Poplicola, or people-lover, 
<A NAME="284"></A>which name had the pre-eminence of the rest, and, therefore, in the sequel 
<A NAME="285"></A>of his narrative we shall use no other.
<A NAME="286"></A><BR><BR>He gave free leave to any to sue for the consulship; but before 
<A NAME="287"></A>the admittance of a colleague, mistrusting the chances, lest emulation 
<A NAME="288"></A>or ignorance should cross his designs, by his sole authority enacted his 
<A NAME="289"></A>best and most important measures. First, he supplied the vacancies of the 
<A NAME="290"></A>senators, whom either Tarquin long before had put to death, or the war 
<A NAME="291"></A>lately cut off; those that he enrolled, they write, amounted to a hundred 
<A NAME="292"></A>and sixty-four; afterwards he made several laws which added much to the 
<A NAME="293"></A>people's liberty, in particular one granting offenders the liberty of appealing 
<A NAME="294"></A>to the people from the judgment of the consuls; a second, that made it 
<A NAME="295"></A>death to usurp any magistracy without the people's consent; a third, for 
<A NAME="296"></A>the relief of poor citizens, which, taking off their taxes, encouraged 
<A NAME="297"></A>their labours; another, against disobedience to the consuls, which was 
<A NAME="298"></A>no less popular than the rest, and rather to the benefit of the commonalty 
<A NAME="299"></A>than to the advantage of the nobles, for it imposed upon disobedience the 
<A NAME="300"></A>penalty of ten oxen and two sheep; the price of a sheep being ten obols, 
<A NAME="301"></A>of an ox, an hundred. For the use of money was then infrequent amongst 
<A NAME="302"></A>the Romans, but their wealth in cattle great; even now pieces of property 
<A NAME="303"></A>are called peculia from pecus, cattle; and they had stamped upon their 
<A NAME="304"></A>most ancient money an ox, a sheep, or a hog; and surnamed their sons Suillii, 
<A NAME="305"></A>Bubulci, Caprarii, and Porcii, from caproe, goats, and porci, 
<A NAME="306"></A>hogs.
<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR>Amidst this mildness and moderation, for one excessive fault he 
<A NAME="308"></A>instituted one excessive punishment; for he made it lawful without trial 
<A NAME="309"></A>to take away any man's life that aspired to a tyranny, and acquitted the 
<A NAME="310"></A>slayer, if he produced evidence of the crime; for though it was not probable 
<A NAME="311"></A>for a man, whose designs were so great, to escape all notice; yet because 
<A NAME="312"></A>it was possible he might, although observed, by force anticipate judgment, 
<A NAME="313"></A>which the usurpation itself would then preclue, he gave a licence to any 
<A NAME="314"></A>to anticipate the usurper. He was honoured likewise for the law touching 
<A NAME="315"></A>the treasury; for because it was necessary for the citizens to contribute 
<A NAME="316"></A>out of their estates to the maintenance of wars, and he was unwilling himself 
<A NAME="317"></A>to be concerned in the care of it, or to permit his friends or indeed to 
<A NAME="318"></A>let the public money pass into any private house, he allotted the temple 
<A NAME="319"></A>of Saturn for the treasury, in which to this day they deposit the tribute-money, 
<A NAME="320"></A>and granted the people the liberty of choosing two young men as quaestors, 
<A NAME="321"></A>or treasurers. The first were Publius Veturius and Marcus Minucius; and 
<A NAME="322"></A>a large sum was collected, for they assessed one hundred and thirty thousand, 
<A NAME="323"></A>excusing orphans and widows from the payment. After these dispositions, 
<A NAME="324"></A>he admitted Lucretius, the father of Lucretia, as his colleague, and gave 
<A NAME="325"></A>him the precedence in the government, by resigning the fasces to him, as 
<A NAME="326"></A>due to his years, which privilege of seniority continued to our time. But 
<A NAME="327"></A>within a few days Lucretius died, and in a new election Marcus Horatius 
<A NAME="328"></A>succeeded in that honour, and continued consul for the remainder of the 
<A NAME="329"></A>year.
<A NAME="330"></A><BR><BR>Now, whilst Tarquin was making preparations in Tuscany for a second 
<A NAME="331"></A>war against the Romans, it is said a great portent occurred. When Tarquin 
<A NAME="332"></A>was king, and had all but completed the buildings of the Capitol, designing, 
<A NAME="333"></A>whether from oracular advice or his own pleasure, to erect an earthen chariot 
<A NAME="334"></A>upon the top, he intrusted the workmanship to Tuscans of the city Veii, 
<A NAME="335"></A>but soon after lost his kingdom. The work thus modelled, the Tuscans set 
<A NAME="336"></A>in a furnace, but the clay showed not those passive qualities which usually 
<A NAME="337"></A>attend its nature, to subside and be condensed upon the evaporation of 
<A NAME="338"></A>the moisture, but rose and swelled out to that bulk, that, when solid and 
<A NAME="339"></A>firm, notwithstanding the removal of the roof and opening the walls of 
<A NAME="340"></A>the furnace, it could not be taken out without much difficulty. The soothsayers 
<A NAME="341"></A>looked upon this as a divine prognostic of success and power to those that 
<A NAME="342"></A>should possess it; and the Tuscans resolved not to deliver it to the Roman, 
<A NAME="343"></A>who demanded it, but answered that it rather belonged to Tarquin than to 
<A NAME="344"></A>those who had sent him into exile. A few days after, they had a horse-race 
<A NAME="345"></A>there, with the usual shows and solemnities, and as the charioteer with 
<A NAME="346"></A>his garland on his head was quietly driving the victorious chariot out 
<A NAME="347"></A>of the ring, the horses, upon no apparent occasion, taking fright, either 
<A NAME="348"></A>by divine instigation or by accident, hurried away their driver at full 
<A NAME="349"></A>speed to Rome; neither did his holding them in prevail, nor his voice, 
<A NAME="350"></A>but he was forced along with violence till, coming to the Capitol, he was 
<A NAME="351"></A>thrown out by the gate called Ratumena. This occurrence raised wonder and 
<A NAME="352"></A>fear in the Veientines, who now permitted the delivery of the 
<A NAME="353"></A>chariot.
<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR>The building of the temple of the Capitoline Jupiter had been vowed 
<A NAME="355"></A>by Tarquin, the son of Demaratus, when warring with the Sabines; Tarquinius 
<A NAME="356"></A>Superbus, his son or grandson, built but could not dedicate it, because 
<A NAME="357"></A>he lost his kingdom before it was quite finished. And now that it was completed 
<A NAME="358"></A>with all its ornaments, Poplicola was ambitious to dedicate it; but the 
<A NAME="359"></A>nobility envied him that honour, as, indeed, also, in some degree, those 
<A NAME="360"></A>his prudence in making laws and conduct in wars entitled him to. Grudging 
<A NAME="361"></A>him, at any rate, the addition of this, they urged Horatius to sue for 
<A NAME="362"></A>the dedication, and, whilst Poplicola was engaged in some military expedition, 
<A NAME="363"></A>voted it to Horatius, and conducted him to the Capitol, as though, were 
<A NAME="364"></A>Poplicola present, they could not have carried it. Yet, some write, Poplicola 
<A NAME="365"></A>was by lot destined against his will to the expedition, the other to the 
<A NAME="366"></A>dedication; and what happened in the performance seems to intimate some 
<A NAME="367"></A>ground for this conjecture; for, upon the Ides of September, which happens 
<A NAME="368"></A>about the full moon of the month Metagitnion, the people having assembled 
<A NAME="369"></A>at the Capitol and silence being enjoined, Horatius, after the performance 
<A NAME="370"></A>of other ceremonies, holding the doors, according to custom, was proceeding 
<A NAME="371"></A>to pronounce the words of dedication, when Marcus, the brother of Poplicola, 
<A NAME="372"></A>who had got a place on purpose beforehand near the door, observing his 
<A NAME="373"></A>opportunity, cried, "O consul, thy son lies dead in the camp;" which made 
<A NAME="374"></A>a great impression upon all others who heard it, yet in nowise discomposed 
<A NAME="375"></A>Horatius, who returned merely the reply, "Cast the dead out whither you 
<A NAME="376"></A>please; I am not a mourner;" and so completed the dedication. The news 
<A NAME="377"></A>was not true, but Marcus thought the he might avert him from his performance; 
<A NAME="378"></A>but it argues him a man of wonderful self-possession, whether he at once 
<A NAME="379"></A>saw through the cheat, or, believing it as true, showed no 
<A NAME="380"></A>discomposure.
<A NAME="381"></A><BR><BR>The same fortune attended the dedication of the second temple; 
<A NAME="382"></A>the first, as has been said, was built by Tarquin, and dedicated by Horatius; 
<A NAME="383"></A>it was burnt down in the civil wars. The second, Sylla built, and, dying 
<A NAME="384"></A>before the dedication, left that honour to Catulus; and when this was demolished 
<A NAME="385"></A>in the Vitellian sedition, Vespasian, with the same success that attended 
<A NAME="386"></A>him in other things, began a third and lived to see it finished, but did 
<A NAME="387"></A>not live to see it again destroyed, as it presently was; but was as fortunate 
<A NAME="388"></A>in dying before its destruction, as Sylla was the reverse in dying before 
<A NAME="389"></A>the dedication of his. For immediately after Vespasian's death it was consumed 
<A NAME="390"></A>by fire. The fourth, which now exists, was both built and dedicated by 
<A NAME="391"></A>Domitian. It is said Tarquin expended forty thousand pounds of silver in 
<A NAME="392"></A>the very foundations; but the whole wealth of the richest private man in 
<A NAME="393"></A>Rome would not discharge the cost of the gilding of this temple in our 
<A NAME="394"></A>days, it amounting to above twelve thousand talents; the pillars were cut 
<A NAME="395"></A>out of Pentelican marble, of a length most happily proportioned to their 
<A NAME="396"></A>thickness; these we saw at Athens; but when they were cut anew at Rome 
<A NAME="397"></A>and polished, they did not gain so much in embellishment as they lost in 
<A NAME="398"></A>symmetry, being rendered too taper and slender. Should any one who wonders 
<A NAME="399"></A>at the costliness of the Capitol visit any one gallery in Domitian's palace, 
<A NAME="400"></A>or hall, or bath, or the apartments of his concubines, Epicharmus's remark 
<A NAME="401"></A>upon the prodigal, that-
<A NAME="402"></A><BR><BR>"'Tis not beneficence, but truth to say,
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>A mere disease of giving things away," would be in his mouth in application 
<A NAME="404"></A>to Domitian. It is neither piety, he would say, nor magnificence, but, 
<A NAME="405"></A>indeed, a mere disease of building, and a desire, like Midas, of converting 
<A NAME="406"></A>everything into gold or stone. And thus much for this 
<A NAME="407"></A>matter.
<A NAME="408"></A><BR><BR>Tarquin, after the great battle wherein he lost his son in combat 
<A NAME="409"></A>with Brutus, fled to Clusium, and sought aid from Lars Porsenna, then one 
<A NAME="410"></A>of those most powerful princes of Italy, and a man of worth and generosity; 
<A NAME="411"></A>who assured him of assistance, immediately sending his commands to Rome 
<A NAME="412"></A>that they should receive Tarquin as their king, and, upon the Romans' refusal, 
<A NAME="413"></A>proclaimed war, and, having signified the time and place where he intended 
<A NAME="414"></A>his attack, approached with a great army. Poplicola was, in his absence, 
<A NAME="415"></A>chosen consul a second time, and Titus Lucretius his colleague, and, returning 
<A NAME="416"></A>to Rome, to show a spirit yet loftier than Porsenna's, built the city Sigliura 
<A NAME="417"></A>when Porsenna was already in the neighbourhood; and walling it at great 
<A NAME="418"></A>expense, there placed a colony of seven hundred men, as being little concerned 
<A NAME="419"></A>at the war. Nevertheless, Porsenna, making a sharp assault, obliged the 
<A NAME="420"></A>defendants to retire to Rome, who had almost in their entrance admitted 
<A NAME="421"></A>the enemy into the city with them; only Poplicola by sallying out at the 
<A NAME="422"></A>gate prevented them, and, joining battle by Tiber side, opposed the enemy, 
<A NAME="423"></A>that pressed on with their multitude, but at last, sinking under desperate 
<A NAME="424"></A>wounds, was carried out of the fight. The same fortune fell upon Lucretius, 
<A NAME="425"></A>so that the Romans, being dismayed, retreated into the city for their security, 
<A NAME="426"></A>and Rome was in great hazard of being taken, the enemy forcing their way 
<A NAME="427"></A>on to the wooden bridge, where Horatius Cocles, seconded by two of the 
<A NAME="428"></A>first men in Rome, Herminius and Lartius, made head against them. Horatius 
<A NAME="429"></A>obtained this name from the loss of one of his eyes in the war, or, as 
<A NAME="430"></A>others write, from the depressure of his nose, which, leaving nothing in 
<A NAME="431"></A>the middle to separate them, made both eyes appear but as one; and hence, 
<A NAME="432"></A>intending to say Cyclops, by a mispronunciation they called him Cocles. 
<A NAME="433"></A>This Cocles kept the bridge, and held back the enemy, till his own party 
<A NAME="434"></A>broke it down behind, and then with his armour dropped into the river, 
<A NAME="435"></A>and swam to the hither side, with a wound in his hip from a Tuscan spear. 
<A NAME="436"></A>Poplicola, admiring his courage, proposed at once that the Romans should 
<A NAME="437"></A>every one make him a present of a day's provisions, and afterwards give 
<A NAME="438"></A>him as much land as he could plough round in one day, and besides erected 
<A NAME="439"></A>a brazen statute to his honour in the temple of Vulcan, as a requital for 
<A NAME="440"></A>the lameness caused by his wound.
<A NAME="441"></A><BR><BR>But Porsenna laying close siege to the city, and a famine raging 
<A NAME="442"></A>amongst the Romans, also a new army of the Tuscans making incursions into 
<A NAME="443"></A>the country, Poplicola, a third time chosen consul, designed to make, without 
<A NAME="444"></A>sallying out, his defence against Porsenna, but, privately stealing forth 
<A NAME="445"></A>against the new army of the Tuscans, put them to flight and slew five thousand. 
<A NAME="446"></A>The story of Mucius is variously given; we, like others, must follow the 
<A NAME="447"></A>commonly received statement. He was a man endowed with every virtue, but 
<A NAME="448"></A>most eminent in war; and, resolving to kill Porsenna, attired himself in 
<A NAME="449"></A>the Tuscan habit, and using the Tuscan language, came to the camp, and 
<A NAME="450"></A>approaching the seat where the king sat amongst his nobles, but not certainly 
<A NAME="451"></A>knowing the king, and fearful to inquire, drew out his sword, and stabbed 
<A NAME="452"></A>one who he thought had most the appearance of king. Mucius was taken in 
<A NAME="453"></A>the act, and whilst he was under examination, a pan of fire was brought 
<A NAME="454"></A>to the king, who intended to sacrifice; Mucius thrust his right hand into 
<A NAME="455"></A>the flame, and whilst it burnt stood looking at Porsenna with a steadfast 
<A NAME="456"></A>and undaunted countenance; Porsenna at last in admiration dismissed him, 
<A NAME="457"></A>and returned his sword, reaching it from his seat; Mucius received it in 
<A NAME="458"></A>his left hand, which occasioned the name of Scaevola, left-handed, and 
<A NAME="459"></A>said, "I have overcome the terrors of Porsenna, yet am vanquished by his 
<A NAME="460"></A>generosity, and gratitude obliges me to disclose what no punishment could 
<A NAME="461"></A>extort; and assured him then, that three hundred Romans, all of the same 
<A NAME="462"></A>resolution, lurked about his camp, only waiting for an opportunity; he, 
<A NAME="463"></A>by lot appointed to the enterprise, was not sorry that he had miscarried 
<A NAME="464"></A>in it, because so brave and good a man deserved rather to be a friend to 
<A NAME="465"></A>the Romans than an enemy. To this Porsenna gave credit, and thereupon expressed 
<A NAME="466"></A>an inclination to a truce, not, I presume, so much out of fear of the three 
<A NAME="467"></A>hundred Romans, as in admiration of the Roman courage. All other writers 
<A NAME="468"></A>call this man Mucius Scaevola, yet Athendrous, son of Sandon, in a book 
<A NAME="469"></A>addressed to Octavia, Caesar's sister, avers he was also called 
<A NAME="470"></A>Postumus.
<A NAME="471"></A><BR><BR>Poplicola, not so much esteeming Porsenna's enmity dangerous to 
<A NAME="472"></A>Rome as his friendship and alliance serviceable, was induced to refer the 
<A NAME="473"></A>controversy with Tarquin to his arbitration, and several times undertook 
<A NAME="474"></A>to prove Tarquin the worst of men, and justly deprived of his kingdom. 
<A NAME="475"></A>But Tarquin proudly replied he would admit no judge, much less Porsenna, 
<A NAME="476"></A>that had fallen away from his engagements; and Porsenna, resenting this 
<A NAME="477"></A>answer, and mistrusting the equity of his cause, moved also by the solicitations 
<A NAME="478"></A>of his son Aruns, who was earnest for the Roman interest, made a peace 
<A NAME="479"></A>on these conditions, that they should resign the land they had taken from 
<A NAME="480"></A>the Tuscans, and restore all prisoners and receive back their deserters. 
<A NAME="481"></A>To confirm the peace, the Romans gave as hostages ten sons of patrician 
<A NAME="482"></A>parents, and as many daughters, amongst whom was Valeria, the daughter 
<A NAME="483"></A>of Poplicola.
<A NAME="484"></A><BR><BR>Upon these assurances, Porsenna ceased from all acts of hostility, 
<A NAME="485"></A>and the young girls went down to the river to bathe at that part where 
<A NAME="486"></A>the winding of the bank formed a bay and made the waters stiller and quieter; 
<A NAME="487"></A>and, seeing no guard, nor any one coming or going over, they were encouraged 
<A NAME="488"></A>to swim over, notwithstanding the depth and violence of the stream. Some 
<A NAME="489"></A>affirm that one of them, by name Cloelia, passing over on horseback, persuaded 
<A NAME="490"></A>the rest to swim after; but, upon their safe arrival, presenting themselves 
<A NAME="491"></A>to Poplicola, he neither praised nor approved their return, but was concerned 
<A NAME="492"></A>lest he should appear less faithful than Porsenna, and this boldness in 
<A NAME="493"></A>the maidens should argue treachery in the Romans; so that, apprehending 
<A NAME="494"></A>them, he sent them back to Porsenna. But Tarquin's men, having intelligence 
<A NAME="495"></A>of this, laid a strong ambuscade on the other side for those that conducted 
<A NAME="496"></A>them; and while these were skirmishing together, Valeria, the daughter 
<A NAME="497"></A>of Poplicola, rushed through the enemy, and fled, and with the assistance 
<A NAME="498"></A>of three of her attendants made good her escape, whilst the rest were dangerously 
<A NAME="499"></A>hedged in by the soldiers; but Aruns, Porsenna's son, upon tidings of it, 
<A NAME="500"></A>hastened to their rescue, and, putting the enemy to flight, delivered the 
<A NAME="501"></A>Romans. When Porsenna saw the maiden returned, demanding who was the author 
<A NAME="502"></A>and adviser of the act, and understanding Cloelia to be the person, he 
<A NAME="503"></A>looked on her with a cheerful and benignant countenance, and, commanding 
<A NAME="504"></A>one of his horses to be brought, sumptuously adorned, made her a present 
<A NAME="505"></A>of it. This is produced as evidence by those who affirm that only Cloelia 
<A NAME="506"></A>passed the river on horseback; those who deny it call it only the honour 
<A NAME="507"></A>the Tuscan did to her courage; a figure, however, on horseback, stands 
<A NAME="508"></A>in the Via Sacra, as you go to the Palatium, which some say is the statue 
<A NAME="509"></A>of Cloelia, others of Valeria. Porsenna, thus reconciled to the Romans, 
<A NAME="510"></A>gave them a fresh instance of his generosity, and commanded his soldiers 
<A NAME="511"></A>to quit the camp merely with their arms, leaving their tents, full of corn 
<A NAME="512"></A>and other stores, as a gift to the Romans. Hence, even down to our time, 
<A NAME="513"></A>when there is a public sale of goods, they cry Porsenna's first, by way 
<A NAME="514"></A>of perpetual commemoration of his kindness. There stood also, by the senate-house, 
<A NAME="515"></A>a brazen statue of him, of plain and antique workmanship.
<A NAME="516"></A><BR><BR>Afterwards, the Sabines, making incursions upon the Romans, Marcus 
<A NAME="517"></A>Valerius, brother to Poplicola, was made consul, and with him Postumius 
<A NAME="518"></A>Tubertus. Marcus, through the management of affairs by the conduct and 
<A NAME="519"></A>direct assistance of Poplicola, obtained two great victories, in the latter 
<A NAME="520"></A>of which he slew thirteen thousand Sabines without the loss of one Roman, 
<A NAME="521"></A>and was honoured, as an accession to his triumph, with an house built in 
<A NAME="522"></A>the Palatium at the public charge; and whereas the doors of other houses 
<A NAME="523"></A>opened inward into the house, they made this to open outward into the street, 
<A NAME="524"></A>to intimate their perpetual public recognition of his merit by thus continually 
<A NAME="525"></A>making way for him. The same fashion in their doors the Greeks, they say, 
<A NAME="526"></A>had of old universally, which appears from their comedies, where those 
<A NAME="527"></A>that are going out make a noise at the door within, to give notice to those 
<A NAME="528"></A>that pass by or stand near the door, that the opening the door into the 
<A NAME="529"></A>street might occasion no surprisal.
<A NAME="530"></A><BR><BR>The year after, Poplicola was made consul the fourth time, when 
<A NAME="531"></A>a confederacy of the Sabines and Latins threatened a war; a superstitious 
<A NAME="532"></A>fear also overran the city on the occasion of general miscarriages of their 
<A NAME="533"></A>women, no single birth coming to its due time. Poplicola, upon consultation 
<A NAME="534"></A>of the Sibylline books, sacrificing to Pluto, and renewing certain games 
<A NAME="535"></A>commanded by Apollo, restored the city to more cheerful assurance in the 
<A NAME="536"></A>gods, and then prepared against the menaces of men. There were appearances 
<A NAME="537"></A>of great preparation, and of a formidable confederacy. Amongst the Sabines 
<A NAME="538"></A>there was one Appius Clausus, a man of a great wealth and strength of body, 
<A NAME="539"></A>but most eminent for his high character and for his eloquence; yet, as 
<A NAME="540"></A>is usually the fate of great men, he could not escape the envy of others, 
<A NAME="541"></A>which was much occasioned by his dissuading the war, and seeming to promote 
<A NAME="542"></A>the Roman interest, with a view, it is thought, to obtaining absolute power 
<A NAME="543"></A>in his own country for himself. Knowing how welcome these reports would 
<A NAME="544"></A>be to the multitude, and how offensive to the army and the abettors of 
<A NAME="545"></A>the war, he was afraid to stand a trial, but, having a considerable body 
<A NAME="546"></A>of friends and allies to assist him, raised a tumult amongst the Sabines, 
<A NAME="547"></A>which delayed the war. Neither was Poplicola wanting, not only to understand 
<A NAME="548"></A>the grounds of the sedition, but to promote and increase it, and he despatched 
<A NAME="549"></A>emissaries with instructions to Clausus, that Poplicola was assured of 
<A NAME="550"></A>his goodness and justice, and thought it indeed unworthy in any man, however 
<A NAME="551"></A>injured, to seek revenge upon his fellow citizens; yet if he pleased, for 
<A NAME="552"></A>his own security, to leave his enemies and come to Rome, he should be received, 
<A NAME="553"></A>both in public and private, with the honour his merit deserved, and their 
<A NAME="554"></A>own glory required. Appius, seriously weighing the matter, came to the 
<A NAME="555"></A>conclusion that it was the best resource which necessity left him, and 
<A NAME="556"></A>advising with his friends, and they inviting others in the same manner, 
<A NAME="557"></A>he came to Rome, bringing five thousand families, with their wives and 
<A NAME="558"></A>children; people of the quietest and steadiest temper of all the Sabines. 
<A NAME="559"></A>Poplicola, informed of their approach, received them with all the kind 
<A NAME="560"></A>offices of a friend, and admitted them at once to the franchise allotting 
<A NAME="561"></A>to every one two acres of land by the river Anio, but to Clausus twenty-five 
<A NAME="562"></A>acres, and gave him a place in the senate; a commencement of political 
<A NAME="563"></A>power which he used so wisely, that he rose to the highest reputation, 
<A NAME="564"></A>was very influential, and left the Claudian house behind him, inferior 
<A NAME="565"></A>to none in Rome.
<A NAME="566"></A><BR><BR>The departure of these men rendered things quiet amongst the Sabines; 
<A NAME="567"></A>yet the chief of the community would not suffer them to settle into peace, 
<A NAME="568"></A>but resented that Clausus now, by turning deserter, should disappoint that 
<A NAME="569"></A>revenge upon the Romans, which, while at home, he had unsuccessfully opposed. 
<A NAME="570"></A>Coming with a great army, they sat down before Fidenae, and placed an ambuscade 
<A NAME="571"></A>of two thousand men near Rome, in wooded and hollow spots, with a design 
<A NAME="572"></A>that some few horsemen, as soon as it was day, should go out and ravage 
<A NAME="573"></A>the country, commanding them upon their approach to the town so to retreat 
<A NAME="574"></A>as to draw the enemy into the ambush. Poplicola, however, soon advertised 
<A NAME="575"></A>of these designs by deserters, disposed his forces to their respective 
<A NAME="576"></A>charges. Postumius Balbus, his son-in-law, going out with three thousand 
<A NAME="577"></A>men in the evening, was ordered to take the hills, under which the ambush 
<A NAME="578"></A>lay, there to observe their motions; his colleague, Lucretius, attended 
<A NAME="579"></A>with a body of the lightest and boldest men, was appointed to meet the 
<A NAME="580"></A>Sabine horse; whilst he, with the rest of the army, encompassed the enemy. 
<A NAME="581"></A>And a thick mist rising accidentally, Postumius, early in the morning, 
<A NAME="582"></A>with shouts from the hills, assailed the ambuscade, Lucretius charged the 
<A NAME="583"></A>light-horse, and Poplicola besieged the camp; so that on all sides defeat 
<A NAME="584"></A>and ruin came upon the Sabines, and without any resistance the Romans killed 
<A NAME="585"></A>them in their flight, their very hopes leading them to their death, for 
<A NAME="586"></A>each division, presuming that the other was safe, gave up all thought of 
<A NAME="587"></A>fighting or keeping their ground; and these quitting the camp to retire 
<A NAME="588"></A>to the ambuscade, and the ambuscade flying to the camp, fugitives thus 
<A NAME="589"></A>met fugitives, and found those from whom they expected succour as much 
<A NAME="590"></A>in need of succour from themselves. The nearness, however, of the city 
<A NAME="591"></A>Fidenae was the preservation of the Sabines, especially those that fled 
<A NAME="592"></A>from the camp; those that could not gain the city either perished in the 
<A NAME="593"></A>field, or were taken prisoners. This victory, the Romans, though usually 
<A NAME="594"></A>ascribing such success to some god, attributed to the conduct of one captain; 
<A NAME="595"></A>and it was observed to be heard amongst the soldiers, that Poplicola had 
<A NAME="596"></A>delivered their enemies lame and blind, and only not in chains, to be despatched 
<A NAME="597"></A>by their swords. From the spoil and prisoners great wealth accrued to the 
<A NAME="598"></A>people.
<A NAME="599"></A><BR><BR>Poplicola, having completed his triumph, and bequeathed the city 
<A NAME="600"></A>to the care of the succeeding consuls, died; thus closing a life which, 
<A NAME="601"></A>so far as human life may be, had been full of all that is good and honourable. 
<A NAME="602"></A>The people, as though they had not duly rewarded his deserts when alive, 
<A NAME="603"></A>but still were in his debt, decreed him a public interment, every one contributing 
<A NAME="604"></A>his quadrans towards the charge; the women, besides, by private consent, 
<A NAME="605"></A>mourned a whole year, a signal mark of honour to his memory. He was buried, 
<A NAME="606"></A>by the people's desire, within the city, in the part called Velia, where 
<A NAME="607"></A>his posterity had likewise privilege of burial; now, however, none of the 
<A NAME="608"></A>family are interred there, but the body is carried thither and set down, 
<A NAME="609"></A>and some one places a burning torch under it and immediately takes it away, 
<A NAME="610"></A>as an attestation of the deceased's privilege, and his receding from his 
<A NAME="611"></A>honour; after which the body is removed.
