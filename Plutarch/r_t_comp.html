<A NAME="1"></A><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>The Comparison of Romulus with Theseus</B></FONT>
<A NAME="2"></A><BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>This is what I have learned of Romulus and Theseus, worthy of memory. It 
<A NAME="11"></A>seems, first of all, that Theseus, out of his own free-will, without any 
<A NAME="12"></A>compulsion, when he might have reigned in security at Troezen in the enjoyment 
<A NAME="13"></A>of no inglorious empire, of his own motion affected great actions, whereas 
<A NAME="14"></A>the other, to escape present servitude and a punishment that threatened 
<A NAME="15"></A>him (according to Plato's phrase), grew valiant purely out of fear, and 
<A NAME="16"></A>dreading the extremest inflictions, attempted great enterprises out of 
<A NAME="17"></A>mere necessity. Again, his greatest action was only the killing of one 
<A NAME="18"></A>King of Alba; while, as mere by-adventures and preludes, the other can 
<A NAME="19"></A>name Sciron, Sinnis, Procrustes, and Corynetes; by reducing and killing 
<A NAME="20"></A>of whom, he rid Greece of terrible oppressors, before any of them that 
<A NAME="21"></A>were relieved knew who did it; moreover, he might without any trouble as 
<A NAME="22"></A>well have gone to Athens by sea, considering he himself never was in the 
<A NAME="23"></A>least injured by those robbers; whereas Romulus could not but be in trouble 
<A NAME="24"></A>whilst Amulius lived. Add to this, the fact that Theseus, for no wrong 
<A NAME="25"></A>done to himself, but for the sake of others, fell upon these villains; 
<A NAME="26"></A>but Romulus and Remus, as long as they themselves suffered no ill by the 
<A NAME="27"></A>tyrant, permitted him to oppress all others. And if it be a great thing 
<A NAME="28"></A>to have been wounded in battle by the Sabines, to have killed King Acron, 
<A NAME="29"></A>and to have conquered many enemies, we may oppose to these actions the 
<A NAME="30"></A>battle with the Centaurs and the feats done against the Amazons. But what 
<A NAME="31"></A>Theseus adventured, in offering himself voluntarily with young boys and 
<A NAME="32"></A>virgins, as part of the tribute unto Crete, either to be a prey to a monster 
<A NAME="33"></A>or a victim upon the tomb of Androgeus, or, according to the mildest form 
<A NAME="34"></A>of the story, to live vilely and dishonourably in slavery to insulting 
<A NAME="35"></A>and cruel men; it is not to be expressed what an act of courage, magnanimity, 
<A NAME="36"></A>or justice to the public, or of love for honour and bravery, that was. 
<A NAME="37"></A>So what methinks the philosophers did not ill define love to be the provision 
<A NAME="38"></A>of the gods for the care and preservation of the young; for the love of 
<A NAME="39"></A>Ariadne, above all, seems to have been the proper work and design of some 
<A NAME="40"></A>god in order to preserve Theseus; and, indeed, we ought not to blame her 
<A NAME="41"></A>for loving him, but rather wonder all men and women were not alike affected 
<A NAME="42"></A>towards him; and if she alone were so, truly I dare pronounce her worthy 
<A NAME="43"></A>of the love of a god, who was herself so great a lover of virtue and goodness, 
<A NAME="44"></A>and the bravest man.
<A NAME="45"></A><BR><BR>Both Theseus and Romulus were by nature meant for governors; yet 
<A NAME="46"></A>neither lived up to the true character of a king, but fell off, and ran, 
<A NAME="47"></A>the one into popularity, the other into tyranny, falling both into the 
<A NAME="48"></A>same fault out of different passions. For a ruler's first aim is to maintain 
<A NAME="49"></A>his office, which is done no less by avoiding what is unfit than by observing 
<A NAME="50"></A>what is suitable. Whoever is either too remiss or too strict is no more 
<A NAME="51"></A>a king or a governor, but either a demagogue or a despot, and so becomes 
<A NAME="52"></A>either odious or contemptible to his subjects. Though certainly the one 
<A NAME="53"></A>seems to be the fault of easiness and good-nature, the other of pride and 
<A NAME="54"></A>severity.
<A NAME="55"></A><BR><BR>If men's calamities, again, are not to be wholly imputed to fortune, 
<A NAME="56"></A>but refer themselves to differences of character, who will acquit either 
<A NAME="57"></A>Theseus of rash and unreasonable anger against his son, or Romulus against 
<A NAME="58"></A>his brother? Looking at motives, we more easily excuse the anger which 
<A NAME="59"></A>a stronger cause, like a severer blow, provoked. Romulus, having disagreed 
<A NAME="60"></A>with his brother advisedly and deliberately on public matters, one would 
<A NAME="61"></A>think could not on a sudden have been put into so great a passion; but 
<A NAME="62"></A>love and jealousy and the complaints of his wife, which few men can avoid 
<A NAME="63"></A>being moved by, seduced Theseus to commit that outrage upon his son. And 
<A NAME="64"></A>what is more, Romulus, in his anger, committed an action of unfortunate 
<A NAME="65"></A>consequence; but that of Theseus ended only in words, some evil speaking, 
<A NAME="66"></A>and an old man's curse; the rest of the youth's disasters seem to have 
<A NAME="67"></A>proceeded from fortune; so that, so far, a man would give his vote on Theseus's 
<A NAME="68"></A>part.
<A NAME="69"></A><BR><BR>But Romulus has, first of all, one great plea, that his performances 
<A NAME="70"></A>proceeded from very small beginnings; for both the brothers being thought 
<A NAME="71"></A>servants and the sons of swine-herds, before becoming freemen themselves, 
<A NAME="72"></A>gave liberty to almost all the Latins, obtaining at once all the most honourable 
<A NAME="73"></A>titles, as destroyers of their country's enemies, preservers of their friends 
<A NAME="74"></A>and kindred, princes of the people, founders of cities, not removers, like 
<A NAME="75"></A>Theseus, who raised and compiled only one house out of many, demolishing 
<A NAME="76"></A>many cities bearing the names of ancient kings and heroes. Romulus, indeed, 
<A NAME="77"></A>did the same afterwards, forcing his enemies to deface and ruin their own 
<A NAME="78"></A>dwellings, and to sojourn with their conquerors; but at first, not by removal, 
<A NAME="79"></A>or increase of an existing city, but by foundation of a new one, he obtained 
<A NAME="80"></A>himself lands, a country, a kingdom, wives, children, and relations. And, 
<A NAME="81"></A>in so doing, he killed or destroyed nobody, but benefited those that wanted 
<A NAME="82"></A>houses and homes and were willing to be of a society and become citizens. 
<A NAME="83"></A>Robbers and malefactors he slew not; but he subdued nations, he overthrew 
<A NAME="84"></A>cities, he triumphed over kings and commanders. As to Remus, it is doubtful 
<A NAME="85"></A>by whose hand he fell; it is generally imputed to others. His mother he 
<A NAME="86"></A>clearly retrieved from death, and placed his grandfather, who was brought 
<A NAME="87"></A>under base and dishonourable vassalage, on the ancient throne of Aeneas, 
<A NAME="88"></A>to whom he did voluntarily many good offices, but never did him harm even 
<A NAME="89"></A>inadvertently. But Theseus, in his forgetfulness and neglect of the command 
<A NAME="90"></A>concerning the flag, can scarcely, methinks, by any excuses, or before 
<A NAME="91"></A>the most indulgent judges, avoid the imputation of parricide. And, indeed, 
<A NAME="92"></A>one of the Attic writers, perceiving it to be very hard to make an excuse 
<A NAME="93"></A>for this, feigns that Aegeus, at the approach of the ship, running hastily 
<A NAME="94"></A>to the Acropolis to see what news, slipped and fell down, as if he had 
<A NAME="95"></A>no servants, or none would attend him on his way to the 
<A NAME="96"></A>shore.
<A NAME="97"></A><BR><BR>And, indeed, the faults committed in the rapes of women admit of 
<A NAME="98"></A>no plausible excuse in Theseus. First, because of the often repetition 
<A NAME="99"></A>of the crime; for he stole Ariadne, Antiope, Anaxo the Troezenian, at last 
<A NAME="100"></A>Helen, when he was an old man, and she not marriageable; she a child, and 
<A NAME="101"></A>he at an age past even lawful wedlock. Then, on account of the cause; for 
<A NAME="102"></A>the Troezenian, Lacedaemonian, and Amazonian virgins, beside that they 
<A NAME="103"></A>were not betrothed to him, were not worthier to raise children by then 
<A NAME="104"></A>the Athenian women, derived from Erechtheus and Cecrops; but it is to be 
<A NAME="105"></A>suspected these things were done out of wantonness and lust. Romulus, when 
<A NAME="106"></A>he had taken near eight hundred women, chose not all, but only Hersilia, 
<A NAME="107"></A>as they say, for himself; the rest he divided among the chief of the city; 
<A NAME="108"></A>and afterwards, by the respect and tenderness and justice shown towards 
<A NAME="109"></A>them, he made it clear that this violence and injury was a commendable 
<A NAME="110"></A>and politic exploit to establish a society; by which he intermixed and 
<A NAME="111"></A>united both nations, and made it the foundation of after friendship and 
<A NAME="112"></A>public stability. And to the reverence and love and constancy he established 
<A NAME="113"></A>in matrimony, time can witness, for in two hundred and thirty years, neither 
<A NAME="114"></A>any husband deserted his wife, nor any wife her husband; but, as the curious 
<A NAME="115"></A>among the Greeks can name the first case of parricide or matricide, so 
<A NAME="116"></A>the Romans all well know that Spurius Carvilius was the first who put away 
<A NAME="117"></A>his wife, accusing her of barrenness. The immediate results were similar; 
<A NAME="118"></A>for upon those marriages the two princes shared in the dominion, and both 
<A NAME="119"></A>nations fell under the same government. But from the marriages of Theseus 
<A NAME="120"></A>proceeded nothing of friendship or correspondence for the advantage of 
<A NAME="121"></A>commerce, but enmities and wars and the slaughter of citizens, and, at 
<A NAME="122"></A>last, the loss of the city Aphidnae, when only out of the compassion of 
<A NAME="123"></A>the enemy, whom they entreated and caressed like gods, they escaped suffering 
<A NAME="124"></A>what Troy did by Paris. Theseus's mother, however, was not only in danger, 
<A NAME="125"></A>but suffered actually what Hecuba did, deserted and neglected by her son, 
<A NAME="126"></A>unless her captivity be not a fiction, as I could wish both that and other 
<A NAME="127"></A>things were. The circumstances of the divine intervention, said to have 
<A NAME="128"></A>preceded or accompanied their births, are also in contrast; for Romulus 
<A NAME="129"></A>was preserved by the special favour of the gods; but the oracle given to 
<A NAME="130"></A>Aegeus commanding him to abstain, seems to demonstrate that the birth of 
<A NAME="131"></A>Theseus was not agreeable to the will of the gods.
