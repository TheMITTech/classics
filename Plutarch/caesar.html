<A NAME="2"></A>
<BR>(died 44 B.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>After Sylla became master of Rome, he wished to make Caesar put away his 
<A NAME="11"></A>wife Cornelia, daughter of Cinna, the late sole ruler of the commonwealth, 
<A NAME="12"></A>but was unable to effect it either by promises or intimidation, and so 
<A NAME="13"></A>contented himself with confiscating her dowry. The ground of Sylla's hostility 
<A NAME="14"></A>to Caesar was the relationship between him and Marius; for Marius, the 
<A NAME="15"></A>elder, married Julia, the sister of Caesar's father, and had by her the 
<A NAME="16"></A>younger Marius, who consequently was Caesar's first cousin. And though 
<A NAME="17"></A>at the beginning, while so many were to be put to death, and there was 
<A NAME="18"></A>so much to do, Caesar was overlooked by Sylla, yet he would not keep quiet, 
<A NAME="19"></A>but presented himself to the people as a candidate for the priesthood, 
<A NAME="20"></A>though he was yet a mere boy. Sylla, without any open opposition, took 
<A NAME="21"></A>measures to have him rejected, and in consultation whether he should be 
<A NAME="22"></A>put to death, when it was urged by some that it was not worth his while 
<A NAME="23"></A>to contrive the death of a boy, he answered, that they knew little who 
<A NAME="24"></A>did not see more than one Marius in that boy. Caesar, on being informed 
<A NAME="25"></A>of this saying, concealed himself, and for a considerable time kept out 
<A NAME="26"></A>of the way in the country of the Sabines, often changing his quarters, 
<A NAME="27"></A>till one night, as he was removing from one house to another on account 
<A NAME="28"></A>of his health, he fell into the hands of Sylla's soldiers, who were searching 
<A NAME="29"></A>those parts in order to apprehend any who had absconded. Caesar, by a bribe 
<A NAME="30"></A>of two talents, prevailed with Cornelius, their captain, to let him go, 
<A NAME="31"></A>and was no sooner dismissed but he put to sea and made for Bithynia. After 
<A NAME="32"></A>a short stay there with Nicomedes, the king, in his passage back he was 
<A NAME="33"></A>taken near the island of Pharmacusa by some of the pirates, who, at that 
<A NAME="34"></A>time, with large fleets of ships and innumerable smaller vessels, infested 
<A NAME="35"></A>the seas everywhere.
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR>When these men at first demanded of him twenty talents for his 
<A NAME="37"></A>ransom, he laughed at them for not understanding the value of their prisoner, 
<A NAME="38"></A>and voluntarily engaged to give them fifty. He presently despatched those 
<A NAME="39"></A>about him to several places to raise the money, till at last he was left 
<A NAME="40"></A>among a set of the most bloodthirsty people in the world, the Cilicians, 
<A NAME="41"></A>only with one friend and two attendants. Yet he made so little of them, 
<A NAME="42"></A>that when he had a mind to sleep, he would send to them, and order them 
<A NAME="43"></A>to make no noise. For thirty-eight days, with all the freedom in the world, 
<A NAME="44"></A>he amused himself with joining in their exercises and games, as if they 
<A NAME="45"></A>had not been his keepers, but his guards. He wrote verses and speeches, 
<A NAME="46"></A>and made them his auditors, and those who did not admire them, he called 
<A NAME="47"></A>to their faces illiterate and barbarous, and would often, in raillery, 
<A NAME="48"></A>threaten to hang them. They were greatly taken with this, and attributed 
<A NAME="49"></A>his free talking to a kind of simplicity and boyish playfulness. As soon 
<A NAME="50"></A>as his ransom was come from Miletus, he paid it, and was discharged, and 
<A NAME="51"></A>proceeded at once to man some ships at the port of Miletus, and went in 
<A NAME="52"></A>pursuit of the pirates, whom he surprised with their ships still stationed 
<A NAME="53"></A>at the island, and took most of them. Their money he made his prize, and 
<A NAME="54"></A>the men he secured in prison at Pergamus, and he made application to Junius, 
<A NAME="55"></A>who was then governor of Asia, to whose office it belonged, as praetor, 
<A NAME="56"></A>to determine their punishment. Junius, having his eye upon the money, for 
<A NAME="57"></A>the sum was considerable, said he would think at his leisure what to do 
<A NAME="58"></A>with the prisoners, upon which Caesar took his leave of him, and went off 
<A NAME="59"></A>to Pergamus, where he ordered the pirates to be brought forth and crucified; 
<A NAME="60"></A>the punishment he had often threatened them with whilst he was in their 
<A NAME="61"></A>hands, and they little dreamt he was in earnest.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR>In the meantime Sylla's power being now on the decline, Caesar's 
<A NAME="63"></A>friends advised him to return to Rome, but he went to Rhodes, and entered 
<A NAME="64"></A>himself in the school of Apollonius, Molon's son, a famous rhetorician, 
<A NAME="65"></A>one who had the reputation of a worthy man, and had Cicero for one of his 
<A NAME="66"></A>scholars. Caesar is said to have been admirably fitted by nature to make 
<A NAME="67"></A>a great statesman and orator, and to have taken such pains to improve his 
<A NAME="68"></A>genius this way that without dispute he might challenge the second place. 
<A NAME="69"></A>More he did not aim at, as choosing to be first rather amongst men of arms 
<A NAME="70"></A>and power, and, therefore, never rose to that height of eloquence to which 
<A NAME="71"></A>nature would have carried him, his attention being diverted to those expeditions 
<A NAME="72"></A>and designs which at length gained him the empire. And he himself, in his 
<A NAME="73"></A>answer to Cicero's panegyric on Cato, desires his reader not to compare 
<A NAME="74"></A>the plain discourse of a soldier with the harangues of an orator who had 
<A NAME="75"></A>not only fine parts, but had employed his life in this 
<A NAME="76"></A>study.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>When he was returned to Rome, he accused Dolabella of mal-administration, 
<A NAME="78"></A>and many cities of Greece came in to attest it. Dolabella was acquitted, 
<A NAME="79"></A>and Caesar, in return for the support he had received from the Greeks, 
<A NAME="80"></A>assisted them in their prosecution of Publius Antonius for corrupt practices, 
<A NAME="81"></A>before Marcus Lucullus, praetor of Macedonia. In this course he so far 
<A NAME="82"></A>succeeded, that Antonius was forced to appeal to the tribunes at Rome, 
<A NAME="83"></A>alleging that in Greece he could not have fair play against Grecians. In 
<A NAME="84"></A>his pleadings at Rome, his eloquence soon obtained him great credit and 
<A NAME="85"></A>favour, and he won no less upon the affections of the people by affability 
<A NAME="86"></A>of his manners and address, in which he showed a tact and consideration 
<A NAME="87"></A>beyond what could have been expected at his age; and the open house he 
<A NAME="88"></A>kept, the entertainments he gave, and the general splendour of his manner 
<A NAME="89"></A>of life contributed little by little to create and increase his political 
<A NAME="90"></A>influence. His enemies slighted the growth of it at first, presuming it 
<A NAME="91"></A>would soon fail when his money was gone; whilst in the meantime it was 
<A NAME="92"></A>growing up and flourishing among the common people. When his power at last 
<A NAME="93"></A>was established and not to be overthrown, and now openly tended to the 
<A NAME="94"></A>altering of the whole constitution, they were aware too late that there 
<A NAME="95"></A>is no beginning so mean, which continued application will not make considerable, 
<A NAME="96"></A>and that despising a danger at first will make it at last irresistible. 
<A NAME="97"></A>Cicero was the first who had any suspicions of his designs upon the government, 
<A NAME="98"></A>and as a good pilot is apprehensive of a storm when the sea is most smiling, 
<A NAME="99"></A>saw the designing temper of the man through this disguise of good humour 
<A NAME="100"></A>and affability, and said that, in general, in all he did and undertook, 
<A NAME="101"></A>he detected the ambition for absolute power, "but when I see his hair so 
<A NAME="102"></A>carefully arranged, and observe him adjusting it with one finger, I cannot 
<A NAME="103"></A>imagine it should enter into such a man's thoughts to subvert the Roman 
<A NAME="104"></A>state." But of this more hereafter.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR>The first proof he had of the people's good-will to him was when 
<A NAME="106"></A>he received by their suffrages a tribuneship in the army, and came out 
<A NAME="107"></A>on the list with a higher place than Caius Popilius. A second and clearer 
<A NAME="108"></A>instance of their favour appeared upon his making a magnificent oration 
<A NAME="109"></A>in praise of his aunt Julia, wife to Marius, publicly in the forum, at 
<A NAME="110"></A>whose funeral he was so bold as to bring forth the images of Marius, which 
<A NAME="111"></A>nobody had dared to produce since the government came into Sylla's hands, 
<A NAME="112"></A>Marius's party having from that time been declared enemies of the state. 
<A NAME="113"></A>When some who were present had begun to raise a cry against Caesar, the 
<A NAME="114"></A>people answered with loud shouts and clapping in his favour, expressing 
<A NAME="115"></A>their joyful surprise and satisfaction at his having, as it were, brought 
<A NAME="116"></A>up again from the grave those honours of Marius, which for so long a time 
<A NAME="117"></A>had been lost to the city. It had always been the custom at Rome to make 
<A NAME="118"></A>funeral orations in praise of elderly matrons, but there was no precedent 
<A NAME="119"></A>of any upon young women till Caesar first made one upon the death of his 
<A NAME="120"></A>own wife. This also procured him favour, and by this show of affection 
<A NAME="121"></A>he won upon the feelings of the people, who looked upon him as a man of 
<A NAME="122"></A>great tenderness and kindness of heart. After he had buried his wife, he 
<A NAME="123"></A>went as quaestor into Spain under one of the praetors, named Vetus, whom 
<A NAME="124"></A>he honoured ever after, and made his son his own quaestor, when he himself 
<A NAME="125"></A>came to be praetor. After this employment was ended, he married Pompeia, 
<A NAME="126"></A>his third wife, having then a daughter by Cornelia, his first wife, whom 
<A NAME="127"></A>he afterwards married to Pompey the Great. He was so profuse in his expenses 
<A NAME="128"></A>that, before he had any public employment, he was in debt thirteen hundred 
<A NAME="129"></A>talents, and many thought that by incurring such expense to be popular 
<A NAME="130"></A>he changed a solid good for what would prove but a short and uncertain 
<A NAME="131"></A>return; but in truth he was purchasing what was of the greatest value at 
<A NAME="132"></A>an inconsiderable rate. When he was made surveyor of the Appian Way, he 
<A NAME="133"></A>disbursed, besides the public money, a great sum out of his private purse; 
<A NAME="134"></A>and when he was aedile, he provided such a number of gladiators, that he 
<A NAME="135"></A>entertained the people with three hundred and twenty single combats, and 
<A NAME="136"></A>by his great liberality and magnificence in theatrical shows, in processions, 
<A NAME="137"></A>and public feastings, he threw into the shade all the attempts that had 
<A NAME="138"></A>been made before him, and gained so much upon the people, that every one 
<A NAME="139"></A>was eager to find out new offices and new honours for him in return for 
<A NAME="140"></A>his munificence.
<A NAME="141"></A><BR><BR>There being two factions in the city, one that of Sylla, which 
<A NAME="142"></A>was very powerful, the other that of Marius, which was then broken and 
<A NAME="143"></A>in a low condition, he undertook to revive this and to make it his own. 
<A NAME="144"></A>And to this end, whilst he was in the height of his repute with the people 
<A NAME="145"></A>for the magnificent shows he gave as aedile, he ordered images of Marius 
<A NAME="146"></A>and figures of Victory, with trophies in their hands, to be carried privately 
<A NAME="147"></A>in the night and placed in the capitol. Next morning when some saw them 
<A NAME="148"></A>bright with gold and beautifully made, with inscriptions upon them, referring 
<A NAME="149"></A>them to Marius's exploits over the Cimbrians, they were surprised at the 
<A NAME="150"></A>boldness of him who had set them up, nor was it difficult to guess who 
<A NAME="151"></A>it was. The fame of this soon spread and brought together a great concourse 
<A NAME="152"></A>of people. Some cried out that it was an open attempt against the established 
<A NAME="153"></A>government thus to revive those honours which had been buried by the laws 
<A NAME="154"></A>and decrees of the senate; that Caesar had done it to sound the temper 
<A NAME="155"></A>of the people whom he had prepared before, and to try whether they were 
<A NAME="156"></A>tame enough to bear his humour, and would quietly give way to his innovations. 
<A NAME="157"></A>On the other hand, Marius's party took courage, and it was incredible how 
<A NAME="158"></A>numerous they were suddenly seen to be, and what a multitude of them appeared 
<A NAME="159"></A>and came shouting into the capitol. Many, when they saw Marius's likeness, 
<A NAME="160"></A>cried for joy, and Caesar was highly extolled as the one man, in the place 
<A NAME="161"></A>of all others, who was a relation worthy of Marius. Upon this the senate 
<A NAME="162"></A>met, and Catulus Lutatius, one of the most eminent Romans of that time, 
<A NAME="163"></A>stood up and inveighed against Caesar, closing his speech with the remarkable 
<A NAME="164"></A>saying that Caesar was now not working mines, but planting batteries to 
<A NAME="165"></A>overthrow the state. But when Caesar had made an apology for himself, and 
<A NAME="166"></A>satisfied the senate, his admirers were very much animated, and advised 
<A NAME="167"></A>him not to depart from his own thoughts for any one, since with the people's 
<A NAME="168"></A>good favour he would ere long get the better of them all, and be the first 
<A NAME="169"></A>man in the commonwealth.
<A NAME="170"></A><BR><BR>At this time, Metellus, the high priest, died, and Catulus and 
<A NAME="171"></A>Isauricus, persons of the highest reputation, and who had great influence 
<A NAME="172"></A>in the senate, were competitors for the office, yet Caesar would not give 
<A NAME="173"></A>way to them, but presented himself to the people as a candidate against 
<A NAME="174"></A>them. The several parties seeming very equal, Catulus, who, because he 
<A NAME="175"></A>had the most honour to lose, was the most apprehensive of the event, sent 
<A NAME="176"></A>to Caesar to buy him off, with offers of a great sum of money. But his 
<A NAME="177"></A>answer was, that he was ready to borrow a larger sum than that to carry 
<A NAME="178"></A>on the contest. Upon the day of election, as his mother conducted him out 
<A NAME="179"></A>of doors with tears after embracing her, "My mother," he said, "to-day 
<A NAME="180"></A>you will see me either high priest or an exile." When the votes were taken, 
<A NAME="181"></A>after a great struggle, he carried it, and excited among the senate and 
<A NAME="182"></A>nobility great alarm lest he might now urge on the people to every kind 
<A NAME="183"></A>of insolence. And Piso and Catulus found fault with Cicero for having let 
<A NAME="184"></A>Caesar escape, when in the conspiracy of Catiline he had given the government 
<A NAME="185"></A>such advantage against him. For Catiline, who had designed not only to 
<A NAME="186"></A>change the present state of affairs, but to subvert the whole empire and 
<A NAME="187"></A>confound all, had himself taken to flight, while the evidence was yet incomplete 
<A NAME="188"></A>against him, before his ultimate purposes had been properly discovered. 
<A NAME="189"></A>But he had left Lentulus and Cethegus in the city to supply his place in 
<A NAME="190"></A>the conspiracy, and whether they received any secret encouragement and 
<A NAME="191"></A>assistance from Caesar is uncertain; all that is certain is, that they 
<A NAME="192"></A>were fully convicted in the senate, and when Cicero, the consul, asked 
<A NAME="193"></A>the several opinions of the senators, how they would have them punished, 
<A NAME="194"></A>all who spoke before Caesar sentenced them to death; but Caesar stood up 
<A NAME="195"></A>and made a set speech, in which he told them that he thought it without 
<A NAME="196"></A>precedent and not just to take away the lives of persons of their birth 
<A NAME="197"></A>and distinction before they were fairly tried, unless there was an absolute 
<A NAME="198"></A>necessity for it; but that if they were kept confined in any towns of Italy 
<A NAME="199"></A>Cicero himself should choose till Catiline was defeated, then the senate 
<A NAME="200"></A>might in peace and at their leisure determine what was best to be 
<A NAME="201"></A>done.
<A NAME="202"></A><BR><BR>This sentence of his carried so much appearance of humanity, and 
<A NAME="203"></A>he gave it such advantage by the eloquence with which he urged it, that 
<A NAME="204"></A>not only those who spoke after him closed with it, but even they who had 
<A NAME="205"></A>before given a contrary opinion now came over to his, till it came about 
<A NAME="206"></A>to Catulus's and Cato's turn to speak. They warmly opposed it, and Cato 
<A NAME="207"></A>intimated in his speech the suspicion of Caesar himself, and pressed the 
<A NAME="208"></A>matter so strongly that the criminals were given up to suffer execution. 
<A NAME="209"></A>As Caesar was going out of the senate, many of the young men who at that 
<A NAME="210"></A>time acted as guards to Cicero ran in with their naked swords to assault 
<A NAME="211"></A>him. But Curio, it is said, threw his gown over him, and conveyed him away, 
<A NAME="212"></A>and Cicero himself, when the young men looked up to see his wishes, gave 
<A NAME="213"></A>a sign not to kill him, either for fear of the people or because he thought 
<A NAME="214"></A>the murder unjust and illegal. If this be true, I wonder how Cicero came 
<A NAME="215"></A>to omit all mention of it in his book about his consulship. He was blamed, 
<A NAME="216"></A>however, afterwards, for not having made use of so fortunate an opportunity 
<A NAME="217"></A>against Caesar, as if he had let it escape him out of fear of the populace, 
<A NAME="218"></A>who, indeed, showed remarkable solicitude about Caesar, and some time after, 
<A NAME="219"></A>when he went into the senate to clear himself of the suspicions he lay 
<A NAME="220"></A>under, and found great clamours raised against him, upon the senate in 
<A NAME="221"></A>consequence sitting longer than ordinary, they went up to the house in 
<A NAME="222"></A>a tumult, and beset it, demanding Caesar, and requiring them to dismiss 
<A NAME="223"></A>him. Upon this, Cato, much fearing some movement among the poor citizens, 
<A NAME="224"></A>who were always the first to kindle the flame among the people, and placed 
<A NAME="225"></A>all their hopes in Caesar, persuaded the senate to give them a monthly 
<A NAME="226"></A>allowance of corn, an expedient which put the commonwealth to the extraordinary 
<A NAME="227"></A>charge of seven million five hundred thousand drachmas in the year, but 
<A NAME="228"></A>quite succeeded in removing the great cause of terror for the present, 
<A NAME="229"></A>and very much weakened Caesar's power, who at that time was just going 
<A NAME="230"></A>to be made praetor, and consequently would have been more formidable by 
<A NAME="231"></A>his office.
<A NAME="232"></A><BR><BR>But there was no disturbance during his praetorship, only what 
<A NAME="233"></A>misfortune he met with in his own domestic affairs. Publius Clodius was 
<A NAME="234"></A>a patrician by descent, eminent both for his riches and eloquence, but 
<A NAME="235"></A>in licentiousness of life and audacity exceeded the most noted profligates 
<A NAME="236"></A>of the day. He was in love with Pompeia, Caesar's wife, and she had no 
<A NAME="237"></A>aversion to him. But there was strict watch kept on her apartment, and 
<A NAME="238"></A>Caesar's mother, Aurelia, who was a discreet woman, being continually about 
<A NAME="239"></A>her, made any interview very dangerous and difficult. The Romans have a 
<A NAME="240"></A>goddess whom they call Bona, the same whom the Greeks call Gynaecea. The 
<A NAME="241"></A>Phrygians, who claim a peculiar title to her, say she was mother to Midas. 
<A NAME="242"></A>The Romans profess she was one of the Dryads, and married to Faunus. The 
<A NAME="243"></A>Grecians affirm that she is that mother of Bacchus whose name is not to 
<A NAME="244"></A>be uttered, and, for this reason, the women who celebrate her festival 
<A NAME="245"></A>cover the tents with vine-branches, and, in accordance with the fable, 
<A NAME="246"></A>a consecrated serpent is placed by the goddess. It is not lawful for a 
<A NAME="247"></A>man to be by, nor so much as in the house, whilst the rites are celebrated, 
<A NAME="248"></A>but the women by themselves perform the sacred offices, which are said 
<A NAME="249"></A>to be much the same with those used in the solemnities of Orpheus. When 
<A NAME="250"></A>the festival comes, the husband, who is either consul or praetor, and with 
<A NAME="251"></A>him every male creature, quits the house. The wife then taking it under 
<A NAME="252"></A>her care sets it in order, and the principal ceremonies are performed during 
<A NAME="253"></A>the night, the women playing together amongst themselves as they keep watch, 
<A NAME="254"></A>and music of various kinds going on.
<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR>As Pompeia was at that time celebrating this feast, Clodius, who 
<A NAME="256"></A>as yet had no beard, and so thought to pass undiscovered, took upon him 
<A NAME="257"></A>the dress and ornaments of a singing woman, and so came thither, having 
<A NAME="258"></A>the air of a young girl. Finding the doors open, he was without any stop 
<A NAME="259"></A>introduced by the maid, who was in the intrigue. She presently ran to tell 
<A NAME="260"></A>Pompeia, but as she was away a long time, he grew uneasy in waiting for 
<A NAME="261"></A>her, and left his post and traversed the house from one room to another, 
<A NAME="262"></A>still taking care to avoid the lights, till at last Aurelia's woman met 
<A NAME="263"></A>him, and invited him to play with her, as the women did among themselves. 
<A NAME="264"></A>He refused to comply, and she presently pulled him forward, and asked him 
<A NAME="265"></A>who he was and whence he Clodius told her he was waiting for Pompeia's 
<A NAME="266"></A>own maid, Abra, being in fact her own name also, and as he said so, betrayed 
<A NAME="267"></A>himself by his voice. Upon which the woman shrieking, ran into the company 
<A NAME="268"></A>where there were lights, and cried out she had discovered a man. The women 
<A NAME="269"></A>were all in a fright. Aurelia covered up the sacred things and stopped 
<A NAME="270"></A>the proceedings, and having ordered the doors to be shut, went about with 
<A NAME="271"></A>lights to find Clodius, who was got into the maid's room that he had come 
<A NAME="272"></A>in with, and was seized there. The women knew him, and drove him out of 
<A NAME="273"></A>doors, and at once, that same night, went home and told their husbands 
<A NAME="274"></A>the story. In the morning, it was all about the town, what an impious attempt 
<A NAME="275"></A>Clodius had made, and how he ought to be punished as an offender, not only 
<A NAME="276"></A>against those whom he had offended, but also against the public and the 
<A NAME="277"></A>gods. Upon which one of the tribunes impeached him for profaning the holy 
<A NAME="278"></A>rites, and some of the principal senators combined together and gave evidence 
<A NAME="279"></A>against him, that besides many other horrible crimes, he had been guilty 
<A NAME="280"></A>of incest with his own sister, who was married to Lucullus. But the people 
<A NAME="281"></A>set themselves against this combination of the nobility, and defended Clodius, 
<A NAME="282"></A>which was of great service to him with the judges, who took alarm and were 
<A NAME="283"></A>afraid to provoke the multitude. Caesar at once dismissed Pompeia, but 
<A NAME="284"></A>being summoned as a witness against Clodius, said he had nothing to charge 
<A NAME="285"></A>him with. This looking like a paradox, the accuser asked him why he parted 
<A NAME="286"></A>with his wife. Caesar replied, "I wished my wife to be not so much as suspected." 
<A NAME="287"></A>Some say that Caesar spoke this as his real thought, others, that he did 
<A NAME="288"></A>it to gratify the people, who were very earnest to save Clodius. Clodius, 
<A NAME="289"></A>at any rate, escaped; most of the judges giving their opinions so written 
<A NAME="290"></A>as to be illegible that they might not be in danger from the people by 
<A NAME="291"></A>condemning him, nor in disgrace with the nobility by acquitting 
<A NAME="292"></A>him.
<A NAME="293"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, in the meantime, being out of his praetorship, had got 
<A NAME="294"></A>the province of Spain, but was in great embarrassment with his creditors, 
<A NAME="295"></A>who, as he was going off, came upon him, and were very pressing and importunate. 
<A NAME="296"></A>This led him to apply himself to Crassus, who was the richest man in Rome, 
<A NAME="297"></A>but wanted Caesar's youthful vigour and heat to sustain the opposition 
<A NAME="298"></A>against Pompey. Crassus took upon him to satisfy those creditors who were 
<A NAME="299"></A>most uneasy to him, and would not be put off any longer, and engaged himself 
<A NAME="300"></A>to the amount of eight hundred and thirty talents, upon which Caesar was 
<A NAME="301"></A>now at liberty to go to his province. In his journey, as he was crossing 
<A NAME="302"></A>the Alps, and passing by a small village of the barbarians with but few 
<A NAME="303"></A>inhabitants, and those wretchedly poor, his companions asked the question 
<A NAME="304"></A>among themselves by way of mockery, if there were any canvassing for offices 
<A NAME="305"></A>there; any contention which should be uppermost, or feuds of great men 
<A NAME="306"></A>one against another. To which Caesar made answer seriously, "For my part, 
<A NAME="307"></A>I had rather be the first man among these fellows than the second man in 
<A NAME="308"></A>Rome." It is said that another time, when free from business in Spain, 
<A NAME="309"></A>after reading some part of the history of Alexander, he sat a great while 
<A NAME="310"></A>very thoughtful, and at last burst out into tears. His friends were surprised, 
<A NAME="311"></A>and asked him the reason of it. "Do you think," said he, "I have not just 
<A NAME="312"></A>cause to weep, when I consider that Alexander at my age had conquered so 
<A NAME="313"></A>many nations, and I have all this time done nothing that is memorable." 
<A NAME="314"></A>As soon as he came into Spain he was very active, and in a few days had 
<A NAME="315"></A>got together ten new cohorts of foot in addition to the twenty which were 
<A NAME="316"></A>there before. With these he marched against the Calaici and Lusitani and 
<A NAME="317"></A>conquered them, and advancing as far as the ocean, subdued the tribes which 
<A NAME="318"></A>never before had been subject to the Romans. Having managed his military 
<A NAME="319"></A>affairs with good success, he was equally happy, in the course of his civil 
<A NAME="320"></A>government. He took pains to establish a good understanding amongst the 
<A NAME="321"></A>several states, and no less care to heal the differences between debtors 
<A NAME="322"></A>and creditors. He ordered that the creditor should receive two parts of 
<A NAME="323"></A>the debtor's yearly income, and that the other part should be managed by 
<A NAME="324"></A>the debtor himself, till by this method the whole debt was at last discharged. 
<A NAME="325"></A>This conduct made him leave his province with a fair reputation; being 
<A NAME="326"></A>rich himself, and having enriched his soldiers, and having received from 
<A NAME="327"></A>them the honourable name of Imperator.
<A NAME="328"></A><BR><BR>There is a law among the Romans, that whoever desires the honour 
<A NAME="329"></A>of a triumph must stay without the city and expect his answer. And another, 
<A NAME="330"></A>that those who stand for the consulship shall appear personally upon the 
<A NAME="331"></A>place. Caesar was come home at the very time of choosing consuls, and being 
<A NAME="332"></A>in a difficulty between these two opposite laws, sent to the senate to 
<A NAME="333"></A>desire that, since he was obliged to be absent, he might sue for the consulship 
<A NAME="334"></A>by his friends. Cato, being backed by the law, at first opposed his request; 
<A NAME="335"></A>afterwards perceiving that Caesar had prevailed with a great part of the 
<A NAME="336"></A>senate to comply with it, he made it his business to gain time, and went 
<A NAME="337"></A>on wasting the whole day in speaking. Upon which Caesar thought fit to 
<A NAME="338"></A>let the triumph fall, and pursued the consulship. Entering the town and 
<A NAME="339"></A>coming forward immediately, he had recourse to a piece of state policy 
<A NAME="340"></A>by which everybody was deceived but Cato. This was the reconciling of Crassus 
<A NAME="341"></A>and Pompey, the two men who then were most powerful in Rome. There had 
<A NAME="342"></A>been a quarrel between them, which he now succeeded in making up, and by 
<A NAME="343"></A>this means strengthened himself by the united power of both, and so under 
<A NAME="344"></A>the cover of an action which carried all the appearance of a piece of kindness 
<A NAME="345"></A>and good-nature, caused what was in effect a revolution in the government. 
<A NAME="346"></A>For it was not the quarrel between Pompey and Caesar, as most men imagine, 
<A NAME="347"></A>which was the origin of the civil wars, but their union, their conspiring 
<A NAME="348"></A>together at first to subvert the aristocracy, and so quarrelling afterwards 
<A NAME="349"></A>between themselves. Cato, who often foretold what the consequence of this 
<A NAME="350"></A>alliance would be, had then the character of a sullen, interfering man, 
<A NAME="351"></A>but in the end the reputation of a wise but unsuccessful 
<A NAME="352"></A>counsellor.
<A NAME="353"></A><BR><BR>Thus Caesar, being doubly supported by the interests of Crassus 
<A NAME="354"></A>and Pompey, was promoted to the consulship, and triumphantly proclaimed 
<A NAME="355"></A>with Calpurnius Bibulus. When he entered on his office he brought in bills 
<A NAME="356"></A>which would have been preferred with better grace by the most audacious 
<A NAME="357"></A>of the tribunes than by a consul, in which he proposed the plantation of 
<A NAME="358"></A>colonies and the division of lands, simply to please the commonalty. The 
<A NAME="359"></A>best and most honourable of the senators opposed it, upon which, as he 
<A NAME="360"></A>had long wished for nothing more than for such a colourable pretext, he 
<A NAME="361"></A>loudly protested how much it was against his will to be driven to seek 
<A NAME="362"></A>support from the people, and how the senate's insulting and harsh conduct 
<A NAME="363"></A>left no other course possible for him than to devote himself henceforth 
<A NAME="364"></A>to the popular cause and interest. And so he hurried out of the senate, 
<A NAME="365"></A>and presenting himself to the people, and there placing Crassus and Pompey, 
<A NAME="366"></A>one on each side of him, he asked them whether they consented to the bills 
<A NAME="367"></A>he had proposed. They owned their assent, upon which he desired them to 
<A NAME="368"></A>assist him against those who had threatened to oppose him with their swords. 
<A NAME="369"></A>They engaged they would, and Pompey added further, that he would meet their 
<A NAME="370"></A>swords with a sword and buckler too. These words the nobles much resented, 
<A NAME="371"></A>as neither suitable to his own dignity, nor becoming the reverence due 
<A NAME="372"></A>to the senate, but resembling rather the vehemence of a boy or the fury 
<A NAME="373"></A>of a madman. But the people were pleased with it. In order to get a yet 
<A NAME="374"></A>firmer hold upon Pompey, Caesar having a daughter, Julia, who had been 
<A NAME="375"></A>before contracted to Servilius Caepio, now betrothed her to Pompey, and 
<A NAME="376"></A>told Servilius he should have Pompey's daughter, who was not unengaged 
<A NAME="377"></A>either, but promised to Sylla's son, Faustus. A little time after, Caesar 
<A NAME="378"></A>married Calpurnia, the daughter of Piso, and got Piso made consul for the 
<A NAME="379"></A>year following. Cato exclaimed loudly against this, and protested, with 
<A NAME="380"></A>a great deal of warmth, that it was intolerable the government should be 
<A NAME="381"></A>prostituted by marriages, and that they should advance one another to the 
<A NAME="382"></A>commands of armies, provinces, and other great posts, by means of women. 
<A NAME="383"></A>Bibulus, Caesar's colleague, finding it was to no purpose to oppose his 
<A NAME="384"></A>bills, but that he was in danger of being murdered in the forum, as also 
<A NAME="385"></A>was Cato, confined himself to his house, and there let the remaining part 
<A NAME="386"></A>of his consulship expire. Pompey, when he was married, at once filled the 
<A NAME="387"></A>forum with soldiers, and gave the people his help in passing the new laws, 
<A NAME="388"></A>and secured Caesar the government of all Gaul, both on this and the other 
<A NAME="389"></A>side of the Alps, together with Illyricum, and the command of four legions 
<A NAME="390"></A>for five years. Cato made some attempts against these proceedings, but 
<A NAME="391"></A>was seized and led off on the way to prison by Caesar, who expected that 
<A NAME="392"></A>he would appeal to the tribunes. But when he saw that Cato went along without 
<A NAME="393"></A>speaking a word, and not only the nobility were indignant, but the people 
<A NAME="394"></A>also, out of respect for Cato's virtue, were following in silence, and 
<A NAME="395"></A>with dejected looks, he himself privately desired one of the tribunes to 
<A NAME="396"></A>rescue Cato. As for the other senators, some few of them attended the house, 
<A NAME="397"></A>the rest, being disgusted, absented themselves. Hence Considius, a very 
<A NAME="398"></A>old man, took occasion one day to tell Caesar that the senators did not 
<A NAME="399"></A>meet because they were afraid of his soldiers. Caesar asked, "Why don't 
<A NAME="400"></A>you, then, out of the same fear, keep at home?" To which Considius replied, 
<A NAME="401"></A>that age was his guard against fear, and that the small remains of his 
<A NAME="402"></A>life were not worth much caution. But the most disgraceful thing that was 
<A NAME="403"></A>done in Caesar's consulship was his assisting to gain the tribuneship for 
<A NAME="404"></A>the same Clodius who had made the attempt on his wife's chastity and intruded 
<A NAME="405"></A>upon the secret vigils. He was elected on purpose to effect Cicero's downfall; 
<A NAME="406"></A>nor did Caesar leave the city to join his army till they two had overpowered 
<A NAME="407"></A>Cicero and driven him out of Italy.
<A NAME="408"></A><BR><BR>Thus far have we followed Caesar's actions before the wars of Gaul. 
<A NAME="409"></A>After this, he seems to begin his course afresh, and to enter upon a new 
<A NAME="410"></A>life and scene of action. And the period of those wars which he now fought, 
<A NAME="411"></A>and those many expeditions in which he subdued Gaul, showed him to be a 
<A NAME="412"></A>soldier and general not in the least inferior to any of the greatest and 
<A NAME="413"></A>most admired commanders who had ever appeared at the head of armies. For 
<A NAME="414"></A>if we compare him with the Fabii, the Metelli, the Scipios, and with those 
<A NAME="415"></A>who were his contemporaries, or not long before him, Sylla, Marius, the 
<A NAME="416"></A>Luculli, or even Pompey himself, whose glory, it may be said, went up at 
<A NAME="417"></A>that time to heaven for every excellence in war, we shall find Caesar's 
<A NAME="418"></A>actions to have surpassed them all. One he may be held to have outdone 
<A NAME="419"></A>in consideration of the difficulty of the country in which he fought, another 
<A NAME="420"></A>in the extent of territory which he conquered; some, in the number and 
<A NAME="421"></A>strength of the enemy whom he defeated; one man, because of the wildness 
<A NAME="422"></A>and perfidiousness of the tribes whose good-will he conciliated, another 
<A NAME="423"></A>in his humanity and clemency to those he overpowered; others, again, in 
<A NAME="424"></A>his gifts and kindnesses to his soldiers; all alike in the number of the 
<A NAME="425"></A>battles which he fought and the enemies whom he killed. For he had not 
<A NAME="426"></A>pursued the wars in Gaul full ten years when he had taken by storm above 
<A NAME="427"></A>eight hundred towns, subdued three hundred states, and of the three millions 
<A NAME="428"></A>of men, who made up the gross sum of those with whom at several times he 
<A NAME="429"></A>engaged, he had killed one million and taken captive a 
<A NAME="430"></A>second.
<A NAME="431"></A><BR><BR>He was so much master of the good-will and hearty service of his 
<A NAME="432"></A>soldiers that those who in other expeditions were but ordinary men displayed 
<A NAME="433"></A>a courage past defeating or withstanding when they went upon any danger 
<A NAME="434"></A>where Caesar's glory was concerned. Such a one was Acilius, who, in the 
<A NAME="435"></A>sea-fight before Marseilles, had his right hand struck off with a sword, 
<A NAME="436"></A>yet did not quit his buckler out of his left, but struck the enemies in 
<A NAME="437"></A>the face with it, till he drove them off and made himself master of the 
<A NAME="438"></A>vessel. Such another was Cassius Scaeva, who, in a battle near Dyrrhachium, 
<A NAME="439"></A>had one of his eyes shot out with an arrow, his shoulder pierced with one 
<A NAME="440"></A>javelin, and his thigh with another; and having received one hundred and 
<A NAME="441"></A>thirty darts upon his target, called to the enemy, as though he would surrender 
<A NAME="442"></A>himself. But when two of them came up to him, he cut off the shoulder of 
<A NAME="443"></A>one with a sword, and by a blow over the face forced the other to retire, 
<A NAME="444"></A>and so with the assistance of his friends, who now came up, made his escape. 
<A NAME="445"></A>Again, in Britain, when some of the foremost officers had accidentally 
<A NAME="446"></A>got into a morass full of water, and there were assaulted by the enemy, 
<A NAME="447"></A>a common soldier, whilst Caesar stood and looked on, threw himself in the 
<A NAME="448"></A>midst of them, and after many signal demonstrations of his valour, rescued 
<A NAME="449"></A>the officers and beat off the barbarians. He himself, in the end, took 
<A NAME="450"></A>to the water, and with much difficulty, partly by swimming, partly by wading, 
<A NAME="451"></A>passed it, but in the passage lost his shield. Caesar and his officers 
<A NAME="452"></A>saw it and admired, and went to meet him with joy and acclamation. But 
<A NAME="453"></A>the soldier, much dejected and in tears, threw himself down at Caesar's 
<A NAME="454"></A>feet and begged his pardon for having let go his buckler. Another time 
<A NAME="455"></A>in Africa, Scipio having taken a ship of Caesar's in which Granius Petro, 
<A NAME="456"></A>lately appointed quaestor, was sailing, gave the other passengers as free 
<A NAME="457"></A>prize to his soldiers, but thought fit to offer the quaestor his life. 
<A NAME="458"></A>But he said it was not usual for Caesar's soldiers to take but give mercy, 
<A NAME="459"></A>and having said so, fell upon his sword and killed himself.
<A NAME="460"></A><BR><BR>This love of honour and passion for distinction were inspired into 
<A NAME="461"></A>them and cherished in them by Caesar himself, who, by his unsparing distribution 
<A NAME="462"></A>of money and honours, showed them that he did not heap up wealth from the 
<A NAME="463"></A>wars for his own luxury, or the gratifying his private pleasures, but that 
<A NAME="464"></A>all he received was but a public fund laid by the reward and encouragement 
<A NAME="465"></A>of valour, and that he looked upon all he gave to deserving soldiers as 
<A NAME="466"></A>so much increase to his own riches. Added to this also, there was no danger 
<A NAME="467"></A>to which he did not willingly expose himself, no labour from which he pleaded 
<A NAME="468"></A>an exemption. His contempt of danger was not so much wondered at by his 
<A NAME="469"></A>soldiers because they knew how much he coveted honour. But his enduring 
<A NAME="470"></A>so much hardship, which he did to all appearance beyond his natural strength, 
<A NAME="471"></A>very much astonished them. For he was a spare man, had a soft and white 
<A NAME="472"></A>skin, was distempered in the head and subject to an epilepsy, which, it 
<A NAME="473"></A>is said, first seized him at Corduba. But he did not make the weakness 
<A NAME="474"></A>of his constitution a pretext for his ease, but rather used war as the 
<A NAME="475"></A>best physic against his indispositions; whilst, by indefatigable journeys, 
<A NAME="476"></A>coarse diet, frequent lodging in the field, and continual laborious exercise, 
<A NAME="477"></A>he struggled with his diseases and fortified his body against all attacks. 
<A NAME="478"></A>He slept generally in his chariots or litters, employing even his rest 
<A NAME="479"></A>in pursuit of action. In the day he was thus carried to the forts, garrisons, 
<A NAME="480"></A>and camps, one servant sitting with him, who used to write down what he 
<A NAME="481"></A>dictated as he went, and a soldier attending behind him with his sword 
<A NAME="482"></A>drawn. He drove so rapidly that when he first left Rome he arrived at the 
<A NAME="483"></A>river Rhone within eight days. He had been an expert rider from his childhood; 
<A NAME="484"></A>for it was usual with him to sit with his hands joined together behind 
<A NAME="485"></A>his back, and so to put his horse to its full speed. And in this war he 
<A NAME="486"></A>disciplined himself so far as to be able to dictate letters from on horseback, 
<A NAME="487"></A>and to give directions to two who took notes at the same time or, as Oppius 
<A NAME="488"></A>says, to more. And it is thought that he was the first who contrived means 
<A NAME="489"></A>for communicating with friends by cipher, when either press of business, 
<A NAME="490"></A>or the large extent of the city, left him no time for a personal conference 
<A NAME="491"></A>about matters that required despatch. How little nice he was in his diet 
<A NAME="492"></A>may be seen in the following instance. When at the table of Valerius Leo, 
<A NAME="493"></A>who entertained him at supper at Milan, a dish of asparagus was put before 
<A NAME="494"></A>him on which his host instead of oil had poured sweet ointment, Caesar 
<A NAME="495"></A>partook of it without any disgust, and reprimanded his friends for finding 
<A NAME="496"></A>fault with it. "For it was enough," said he, "not to eat what you did not 
<A NAME="497"></A>like; but he who reflects on another man's want of breeding, shows he wants 
<A NAME="498"></A>it as much himself." Another time upon the road he was driven by a storm 
<A NAME="499"></A>into a poor man's cottage, where he found but one room, and that such as 
<A NAME="500"></A>would afford but a mean reception to a single person, and therefore told 
<A NAME="501"></A>his companions places of honour should be given up to the greater men, 
<A NAME="502"></A>and necessary accommodations to the weaker, and accordingly ordered that 
<A NAME="503"></A>Oppius, who was in bad health, should lodge within, whilst he and the rest 
<A NAME="504"></A>slept under a shed at the door.
<A NAME="505"></A><BR><BR>His first war in Gaul was against the Helvetians and Tigurini, 
<A NAME="506"></A>who having burnt their own towns, twelve in number, and four hundred villages, 
<A NAME="507"></A>would have marched forward through that part of Gaul which was included 
<A NAME="508"></A>in the Roman province, as the Cimbrians and Teutons formerly had done. 
<A NAME="509"></A>Nor were they inferior to these in courage; and in numbers they were equal, 
<A NAME="510"></A>being in all three hundred thousand, of which one hundred and ninety thousand 
<A NAME="511"></A>were fighting men. Caesar did not engage the Tigurini in person, but Labienus, 
<A NAME="512"></A>under his directions, routed them near the rivet Arar. The Helvetians surprised 
<A NAME="513"></A>Caesar, and unexpectedly set upon him as he was conducting his army to 
<A NAME="514"></A>a confederate town. He succeeded, however, in making his retreat into a 
<A NAME="515"></A>strong position, where, when he had mustered and marshalled his men, his 
<A NAME="516"></A>horse was brought to him; upon which he said, "When I have won the battle, 
<A NAME="517"></A>I will use my horse for the chase, but at present let us go against the 
<A NAME="518"></A>enemy," and accordingly charged them on foot. After a long and severe combat, 
<A NAME="519"></A>he drove the main army out of the field, but found the hardest work at 
<A NAME="520"></A>their carriages and ramparts, where not only the men stood and fought, 
<A NAME="521"></A>but the women also and children defended themselves till they were cut 
<A NAME="522"></A>to pieces; insomuch that the fight was scarcely ended till midnight. This 
<A NAME="523"></A>action, glorious in itself, Caesar crowned with another yet more noble, 
<A NAME="524"></A>by gathering in a body all the barbarians that had escaped out of the battle, 
<A NAME="525"></A>above one hundred thousand in number, and obliging them to re-occupy the 
<A NAME="526"></A>country which they had deserted and the cities which they had burnt. This 
<A NAME="527"></A>he did for fear the Germans should pass it and possess themselves of the 
<A NAME="528"></A>land whilst it lay uninhabited.
<A NAME="529"></A><BR><BR>His second war was in defence of the Gauls against the Germans, 
<A NAME="530"></A>though some time before he had made Ariovistus, their king, recognized 
<A NAME="531"></A>at Rome as an ally. But they were very insufferable neighbours to those 
<A NAME="532"></A>under his government; and it was probable, when occasion offered, they 
<A NAME="533"></A>would renounce the present arrangements, and march on to occupy Gaul. But 
<A NAME="534"></A>finding his officers timorous, and especially those of the young nobility 
<A NAME="535"></A>who came along with him in hopes of turning their campaigns with him into 
<A NAME="536"></A>a means for their own pleasure or profit, he called them together, and 
<A NAME="537"></A>advised them to march off, and not run the hazard of a battle against their 
<A NAME="538"></A>inclinations, since they had such weak unmanly feelings; telling them that 
<A NAME="539"></A>he would take only the tenth legion and march against the barbarians, whom 
<A NAME="540"></A>he did not expect to find an enemy more formidable than the Cimbri, nor, 
<A NAME="541"></A>he added, should they find him a general inferior to Marius. Upon this, 
<A NAME="542"></A>the tenth legion deputed some of their body to pay him their acknowledgments 
<A NAME="543"></A>and thanks, and the other legions blamed their officers, and all, with 
<A NAME="544"></A>great vigour and zeal, followed him many days' journey, till they encamped 
<A NAME="545"></A>within two hundred furlongs of the enemy. Ariovistus's courage to some 
<A NAME="546"></A>extent was cooled upon their very approach; for never expecting the Romans 
<A NAME="547"></A>would attack the Germans, whom he had thought it more likely they would 
<A NAME="548"></A>not venture to withstand even in defence of their own subjects, he was 
<A NAME="549"></A>the more surprised at conduct, and saw his army to be in consternation. 
<A NAME="550"></A>They were still more discouraged by the prophecies of their holy women, 
<A NAME="551"></A>who foretell the future by observing the eddies of rivers, and taking signs 
<A NAME="552"></A>from the windings and noise of streams, and who now warned them not to 
<A NAME="553"></A>engage before the next new moon appeared. Caesar having had intimation 
<A NAME="554"></A>of this, and seeing the Germans lie still, thought it expedient to attack 
<A NAME="555"></A>them whilst they were under these apprehensions, rather than sit still 
<A NAME="556"></A>and wait their time. Accordingly he made his approaches to the strongholds 
<A NAME="557"></A>and hills on which they lay encamped, and so galled and fretted them that 
<A NAME="558"></A>at last they came down with great fury to engage. But he gained a signal 
<A NAME="559"></A>victory, and pursued them for four hundred furlongs, as far as the Rhine; 
<A NAME="560"></A>all which space was covered with spoils and bodies of the slain. Ariovistus 
<A NAME="561"></A>made shift to pass the Rhine with the small remains of an army, for it 
<A NAME="562"></A>is said the number of the slain amounted to eighty thousand.
<A NAME="563"></A><BR><BR>After this action, Caesar left his army at their winter quarters 
<A NAME="564"></A>in the country of the Sequani, and, in order to attend to affairs at Rome, 
<A NAME="565"></A>went into that part of Gaul which lies on the Po, and was part of his province; 
<A NAME="566"></A>for the river Rubicon divides Gaul, which is on this side the Alps, from 
<A NAME="567"></A>the rest of Italy. There he sat down and employed himself in courting people's 
<A NAME="568"></A>favour; great numbers coming to him continually, and always finding their 
<A NAME="569"></A>requests answered; for he never failed to dismiss all with present pledges 
<A NAME="570"></A>of his kindness in hand, and further hopes for the future. And during all 
<A NAME="571"></A>this time of the war in Gaul, Pompey never observed how Caesar was on the 
<A NAME="572"></A>one hand using the arms of Rome to effect his conquests, and on the other 
<A NAME="573"></A>was gaining over and securing to himself the favour of the Romans with 
<A NAME="574"></A>the wealth which those conquests obtained him. But when he heard that the 
<A NAME="575"></A>Belgae, who were the most powerful of all the Gauls, and inhabited a third 
<A NAME="576"></A>part of the country, were revolted, and had got together a great many thousand 
<A NAME="577"></A>men in arms, he immediately set out and took his way hither with great 
<A NAME="578"></A>expedition, and falling upon the enemy as they were ravaging the Gauls, 
<A NAME="579"></A>his allies, he soon defeated and put to flight the largest and least scattered 
<A NAME="580"></A>division of them. For though their numbers were great, yet they made but 
<A NAME="581"></A>a slender defence, and the marshes and deep rivers were made passable to 
<A NAME="582"></A>the Roman foot by the vast quantity of dead bodies. Of those who revolted, 
<A NAME="583"></A>all the tribes that lived near the ocean came over without fighting, and 
<A NAME="584"></A>he, therefore, led his army against the Nervii, the fiercest and most warlike 
<A NAME="585"></A>people of all in those parts. These live in a country covered with continuous 
<A NAME="586"></A>woods, and having lodged their children and property out of the way in 
<A NAME="587"></A>the depth of the forest, fell upon Caesar with a body of sixty thousand 
<A NAME="588"></A>men, before he was prepared for them, while he was making his encampment. 
<A NAME="589"></A>They soon routed his cavalry, and having surrounded the twelfth and seventh 
<A NAME="590"></A>legions, killed all the officers, and had not Caesar himself snatched up 
<A NAME="591"></A>a buckler and forced his way through his own men to come up to the barbarians, 
<A NAME="592"></A>or had not the tenth legion, when they saw him in danger, run in from the 
<A NAME="593"></A>tops of the hills, where they lay, and broken through the enemy's ranks 
<A NAME="594"></A>to rescue him, in all probability not a Roman would have been saved. But 
<A NAME="595"></A>now, under the influence of Caesar's bold example, they fought a battle, 
<A NAME="596"></A>as the phrase is, of more than human courage, and yet with their utmost 
<A NAME="597"></A>efforts they were not able to drive the enemy out of the field, but cut 
<A NAME="598"></A>them down fighting in their defence. For out of sixty thousand men, it 
<A NAME="599"></A>is stated that not above five hundred survived the battle, and of four 
<A NAME="600"></A>hundred of their senators not above three.
<A NAME="601"></A><BR><BR>When the Roman senate had received news of this, they voted sacrifices 
<A NAME="602"></A>and festivals to the gods, to be strictly observed for the space of fifteen 
<A NAME="603"></A>days, a longer space than ever was observed for any victory before. The 
<A NAME="604"></A>danger to which they had been exposed by the joint outbreak of such a number 
<A NAME="605"></A>of nations was felt to have been great; and the people's fondness for Caesar 
<A NAME="606"></A>gave additional lustre to successes achieved by him. He now, after settling 
<A NAME="607"></A>everything in Gaul, came back again, and spent the winter by the Po, in 
<A NAME="608"></A>order to carry on the designs he had in hand at Rome. All who were candidates 
<A NAME="609"></A>for offices used his assistance, and were supplied with money from him 
<A NAME="610"></A>to corrupt the people and buy their votes, in return of which, when they 
<A NAME="611"></A>were chosen, they did all things to advance his power. But what was more 
<A NAME="612"></A>considerable, the most eminent and powerful men in Rome in great numbers 
<A NAME="613"></A>came to visit him at Lucca, Pompey, and Crassus, and Appius, the governor 
<A NAME="614"></A>of Sardinia, and Nepos, the pro-consul of Spain, so that there were in 
<A NAME="615"></A>the place at one time one hundred and twenty lictors and more than two 
<A NAME="616"></A>hundred senators. In deliberation here held, it was determined that Pompey 
<A NAME="617"></A>and Crassus should be consuls again for the following year; that Caesar 
<A NAME="618"></A>should have a fresh supply of money, and that his command should be renewed 
<A NAME="619"></A>to him for five years more. It seemed very extravagant to all thinking 
<A NAME="620"></A>men that those very persons who had received so much money from Caesar 
<A NAME="621"></A>should persuade the senate to grant him more, as if he were in want. Though 
<A NAME="622"></A>in truth it was not so much upon persuasion as compulsion that, with sorrow 
<A NAME="623"></A>and groans for their own acts, they passed the measure. Cato was not present, 
<A NAME="624"></A>for they had sent him seasonably out of the way into Cyprus; but Favonius, 
<A NAME="625"></A>who was a zealous imitator of Cato, when he found he could do no good by 
<A NAME="626"></A>opposing it, broke out of the house, and loudly declaimed against these 
<A NAME="627"></A>proceedings to the people, but none gave him any hearing; some slighting 
<A NAME="628"></A>him out of respect to Crassus and Pompey, and the greater part to gratify 
<A NAME="629"></A>Caesar, on whom depended their hopes.
<A NAME="630"></A><BR><BR>After this, Caesar returned again to his forces in Gaul, when he 
<A NAME="631"></A>found that country involved in a dangerous war, two strong nations of the 
<A NAME="632"></A>Germans having lately passed the Rhine to conquer it; one of them called 
<A NAME="633"></A>the Usipes. the other the Tenteritae. Of the war with the people, Caesar 
<A NAME="634"></A>himself has given this account in his commentaries, that the barbarians, 
<A NAME="635"></A>having sent ambassadors to treat with him, did, during the treaty, set 
<A NAME="636"></A>upon him in his march, by which means with eight hundred men they routed 
<A NAME="637"></A>five thousand of his horse, who did not suspect their coming; that afterwards 
<A NAME="638"></A>they sent other ambassadors to renew the same fraudulent practices, whom 
<A NAME="639"></A>he kept in custody, and led on his army against the barbarians, as judging 
<A NAME="640"></A>it mere simplicity to keep faith with those who had so faithlessly broken 
<A NAME="641"></A>the terms they had agreed to. But Tanusius states that when the senate 
<A NAME="642"></A>decreed festivals and sacrifices for this victory, Cato declared it to 
<A NAME="643"></A>be his opinion that Caesar ought to be given into the hands of the barbarians, 
<A NAME="644"></A>that so the guilt which this breach of faith might otherwise bring upon 
<A NAME="645"></A>the state might be expiated by transferring the curse on him, who was the 
<A NAME="646"></A>occasion of it. Of those who passed the Rhine, there were four hundred 
<A NAME="647"></A>thousand cut off; those few who escaped were sheltered by the Sugambri, 
<A NAME="648"></A>a people of Germany. Caesar took hold of this pretence to invade the Germans, 
<A NAME="649"></A>being at the same time ambitious of the honour of being the first man that 
<A NAME="650"></A>should pass the Rhine with an army. He carried a bridge across it, though 
<A NAME="651"></A>it was very wide, and the current at that particular point very full, strong, 
<A NAME="652"></A>and violent, bringing down with its waters trunks of trees, and other lumber, 
<A NAME="653"></A>which much shook and weakened the foundations of his bridge. But he drove 
<A NAME="654"></A>great piles of wood into the bottom of the river above the passage, to 
<A NAME="655"></A>catch and stop these as they floated down, and thus fixing his bridle upon 
<A NAME="656"></A>the stream, successfully finished his bridge, which no one who saw could 
<A NAME="657"></A>believe to be the work but of ten days.
<A NAME="658"></A><BR><BR>In the passage of his army over it he met with no opposition; the 
<A NAME="659"></A>Suevi themselves, who are the most warlike people of all Germany, flying 
<A NAME="660"></A>with their effects into the deepest and most densely wooded valleys. When 
<A NAME="661"></A>he had burnt all the enemy's country, and encouraged those who embraced 
<A NAME="662"></A>the Roman interest, he went back into Gaul, after eighteen days' stay in 
<A NAME="663"></A>Germany. But his expedition into Britain was the most famous testimony 
<A NAME="664"></A>of his courage. For he was the first who brought a navy into the western 
<A NAME="665"></A>ocean, or who sailed into the Atlantic with an army to make war; and by 
<A NAME="666"></A>invading an island, the reported extent of which had made its existence 
<A NAME="667"></A>a matter of controversy among historians, many of whom questioned whether 
<A NAME="668"></A>it were not a mere name and fiction, not a real place, he might be said 
<A NAME="669"></A>to have carried the Roman empire beyond the limits of the known world. 
<A NAME="670"></A>He passed thither twice from that part of Gaul which lies over against 
<A NAME="671"></A>it, and in several battles which he fought did more hurt to the enemy than 
<A NAME="672"></A>service to himself, for the islanders were so miserably poor that they 
<A NAME="673"></A>had nothing worth being plundered of. When he found himself unable to put 
<A NAME="674"></A>such an end to the war as he wished, he was content to take hostages from 
<A NAME="675"></A>the king, and to impose a tribute, and then quitted the island. At his 
<A NAME="676"></A>arrival in Gaul, he found letters which lay ready to be conveyed over the 
<A NAME="677"></A>water to him from his friends at Rome, announcing his daughter's death, 
<A NAME="678"></A>who died in labour of a child by Pompey. Caesar and Pompey both were much 
<A NAME="679"></A>afflicted with her death, nor were their friends less disturbed, believing 
<A NAME="680"></A>that the alliance was now broken which had hitherto kept the sickly commonwealth 
<A NAME="681"></A>in peace, for the child also died within a few days after the mother. The 
<A NAME="682"></A>people took the body of Julia, in spite of the opposition of the tribunes, 
<A NAME="683"></A>and carried it into the field of Mars, and there her funeral rites were 
<A NAME="684"></A>performed, and her remains are laid.
<A NAME="685"></A><BR><BR>Caesar's army was now grown very numerous, so that he was forced 
<A NAME="686"></A>to disperse them into various camps for their winter quarters, and he having 
<A NAME="687"></A>gone himself to Italy as he used to do, in his absence a general outbreak 
<A NAME="688"></A>throughout the whole of Gaul commenced, and large armies marched about 
<A NAME="689"></A>the country, and attacked the Roman quarters, and attempted to make themselves 
<A NAME="690"></A>masters of the forts where they lay. The greatest and strongest party of 
<A NAME="691"></A>the rebels, under the command of Abriorix, cut off Cotta and Titurius with 
<A NAME="692"></A>all their men, while a force sixty thousand strong besieged the legion 
<A NAME="693"></A>under the command of Cicero, and had almost taken it by storm, the Roman 
<A NAME="694"></A>soldiers being all wounded, and having quite spent themselves by a defence 
<A NAME="695"></A>beyond their natural strength. But Caesar, who was at a great distance, 
<A NAME="696"></A>having received the news, quickly got together seven thousand men, and 
<A NAME="697"></A>hastened to relieve Cicero. The besiegers were aware of it, and went to 
<A NAME="698"></A>meet him, with great confidence that they should easily overpower such 
<A NAME="699"></A>a handful of men. Caesar, to increase their presumption, seemed to avoid 
<A NAME="700"></A>fighting, and still marched off, till he found a place conveniently situated 
<A NAME="701"></A>for a few to engage against many, where he encamped. He kept his soldiers 
<A NAME="702"></A>from making any attack upon the enemy, and commanded them to raise the 
<A NAME="703"></A>ramparts higher and barricade the gates, that by show of fear they might 
<A NAME="704"></A>heighten the enemy's contempt of them. Till at last they came without any 
<A NAME="705"></A>order in great security to make an assault, when he issued forth and put 
<A NAME="706"></A>them in flight with the loss of many men.
<A NAME="707"></A><BR><BR>This quieted the greater part of the commotions in these parts 
<A NAME="708"></A>of Gaul, and Caesar, in the course of the winter, visited every part of 
<A NAME="709"></A>the country, and with great vigilance took precautions against all innovations. 
<A NAME="710"></A>For there were three legions now come to him to supply the place of the 
<A NAME="711"></A>men he had lost, of which Pompey furnished him with two out of those under 
<A NAME="712"></A>his command; the other was newly raised in the part of Gaul by the Po. 
<A NAME="713"></A>But in a while the seeds of war, which had long since been secretly sown 
<A NAME="714"></A>and scattered by the most powerful men in those warlike nations, broke 
<A NAME="715"></A>forth into the greatest and most dangerous war that was in those parts, 
<A NAME="716"></A>both as regards the number of men in the vigour of their youth who were 
<A NAME="717"></A>gathered and armed from all quarters, the vast funds of money collected 
<A NAME="718"></A>to maintain it, the strength of the towns, and the difficulty of the country 
<A NAME="719"></A>where it carried on. It being winter, the rivers were frozen, the woods 
<A NAME="720"></A>covered with snow, and the level country flooded, so that in some places 
<A NAME="721"></A>the ways were lost through the depth of the snow; in others, the overflowing 
<A NAME="722"></A>of marshes and streams made every kind of passage uncertain. All which 
<A NAME="723"></A>difficulties made it seem impracticable for Caesar to make any attempt 
<A NAME="724"></A>upon the insurgents. Many tribes had revolted together, the chief of them 
<A NAME="725"></A>being the Arverni and Carnutini; the general who had the supreme command 
<A NAME="726"></A>in war was Vergentorix, whose father the Gauls had put to death on suspicion 
<A NAME="727"></A>of his aiming at absolute government.
<A NAME="728"></A><BR><BR>He having disposed his army in several bodies, and set officers 
<A NAME="729"></A>over them, drew over to him all the country round about as far as those 
<A NAME="730"></A>that lie upon the Arar, and having intelligence of the opposition which 
<A NAME="731"></A>Caesar now experienced at Rome, thought to engage all Gaul in the war. 
<A NAME="732"></A>Which if he had done a little later, when Caesar was taken up with the 
<A NAME="733"></A>civil wars, Italy had been put into as great a terror as before it was 
<A NAME="734"></A>by the Cimbri. But Caesar, who above all men was gifted with the faculty 
<A NAME="735"></A>of making the right use of everything in war, and most especially of seizing 
<A NAME="736"></A>the right moment, as soon as he heard of the revolt, returned immediately 
<A NAME="737"></A>the same way he went, and showed the barbarians, by the quickness of his 
<A NAME="738"></A>march in such a severe season, that an army was advancing against them 
<A NAME="739"></A>which was invincible. For in the time that one would have thought it scarce 
<A NAME="740"></A>credible that a courier or express should have come with a message from 
<A NAME="741"></A>him, he himself appeared with all his army, ravaging the country, reducing 
<A NAME="742"></A>their posts, subduing their towns, receiving into his protection those 
<A NAME="743"></A>who declared for him. Till at last the Edui, who hitherto had styled themselves 
<A NAME="744"></A>brethren to the Romans, and had been much honoured by them, declared against 
<A NAME="745"></A>him, and joined the rebels, to the great discouragement of his army. Accordingly 
<A NAME="746"></A>he removed thence, and passed the country of the Ligones, desiring to reach 
<A NAME="747"></A>the territories of the Sequani, who were his friends, and who lay like 
<A NAME="748"></A>a bulwark in front of Italy against the other tribes of Gaul. There the 
<A NAME="749"></A>enemy came upon him, and surrounded him with many myriads, whom he also 
<A NAME="750"></A>was eager to engage; and at last, after some time and with much slaughter, 
<A NAME="751"></A>gained on the whole a complete victory; though at first he appears to have 
<A NAME="752"></A>met with some reverse, and the Aruveni show you a small sword hanging up 
<A NAME="753"></A>in a temple, which they say was taken from Caesar. Caesar saw this afterwards 
<A NAME="754"></A>himself, and smiled, and when his friends advised it should be taken down, 
<A NAME="755"></A>would not permit it, because he looked upon it as consecrated.
<A NAME="756"></A><BR><BR>After the defeat, a great part of those who had escaped fled with 
<A NAME="757"></A>their king into a town called Alesia, which Caesar besieged, though the 
<A NAME="758"></A>height of the walls, and number of those who defended them, made it appear 
<A NAME="759"></A>impregnable; and meantime, from without the walls, he was assailed by a 
<A NAME="760"></A>greater danger than can be expressed. For the choice men of Gaul, picked 
<A NAME="761"></A>out of each nation, and well armed, came to relieve Alesia, to the number 
<A NAME="762"></A>of three hundred thousand; nor were there in the town less than one hundred 
<A NAME="763"></A>and seventy thousand. So that Caesar being shut up betwixt two such forces, 
<A NAME="764"></A>was compelled to protect himself by two walls, one towards the town, the 
<A NAME="765"></A>other against the relieving army, as knowing if these forces should join, 
<A NAME="766"></A>his affairs would be entirely ruined. The danger that he underwent before 
<A NAME="767"></A>Alesia justly gained him great honour on many accounts, and gave him an 
<A NAME="768"></A>opportunity of showing greater instances of his valour and conduct than 
<A NAME="769"></A>any other contest had done. One wonders much how he should be able to engage 
<A NAME="770"></A>and defeat so many thousands of men without the town, and not be perceived 
<A NAME="771"></A>by those within, but yet more, that the Romans themselves, who guarded 
<A NAME="772"></A>their wall which was next to the town, should be strangers to it. For even 
<A NAME="773"></A>they knew nothing of the victory, till they heard the cries of the men 
<A NAME="774"></A>and lamentations of the women who were in the town, and had from thence 
<A NAME="775"></A>seen the Romans at a distance carrying into their camp a great quantity 
<A NAME="776"></A>of bucklers, adorned with gold and silver, many breastplates stained with 
<A NAME="777"></A>blood, besides cups and tents made in the Gallic fashion. So soon did so 
<A NAME="778"></A>vast an army dissolve and vanish like a ghost or dream, the greatest part 
<A NAME="779"></A>of them being killed upon the spot. Those who were in Alesia, having given 
<A NAME="780"></A>themselves and Caesar much trouble, surrendered at last; and Vergentorix, 
<A NAME="781"></A>who was the chief spring of all the war, putting his best armour on, and 
<A NAME="782"></A>adorning his horse, rode out of the gates, and made a turn about Caesar 
<A NAME="783"></A>as he was sitting, then quitting his horse, threw off his armour, and remained 
<A NAME="784"></A>quietly sitting at Caesar's feet until he was led away to be reserved for 
<A NAME="785"></A>the triumph.
<A NAME="786"></A><BR><BR>Caesar had long ago resolved upon the overthrow of Pompey, as had 
<A NAME="787"></A>Pompey, for that matter, upon his. For Crassus, the fear of whom had hitherto 
<A NAME="788"></A>kept them in peace, having now been killed in Parthia, if the one of them 
<A NAME="789"></A>wished to make himself the greatest man in Rome, he had only to overthrow 
<A NAME="790"></A>the other; and if he again wished to prevent his own fall, he had nothing 
<A NAME="791"></A>for it but to be beforehand with him whom he feared. Pompey had not been 
<A NAME="792"></A>long under any such apprehensions, having till lately despised Caesar, 
<A NAME="793"></A>as thinking it no difficult matter to put down him whom he himself had 
<A NAME="794"></A>advanced. But Caesar had entertained this design from the beginning against 
<A NAME="795"></A>his rivals, and had retired, like an expert wrestler, to prepare himself 
<A NAME="796"></A>apart for the combat. Making the Gallic wars his exercise-ground, he had 
<A NAME="797"></A>at once improved the strength of his soldiery, and had heightened his own 
<A NAME="798"></A>glory by his great actions, so that he was looked on as one who might challenge 
<A NAME="799"></A>comparison with Pompey. Nor did he let go any of those advantages which 
<A NAME="800"></A>were now given him both by Pompey himself and the times, and the ill-government 
<A NAME="801"></A>of Rome, where all who were candidates for offices publicly gave money, 
<A NAME="802"></A>and without any shame bribed the people, who, having received their pay, 
<A NAME="803"></A>did not contend for their benefactors with their bare suffrages, but with 
<A NAME="804"></A>bows, swords, and slings. So that after having many times stained the place 
<A NAME="805"></A>of election with blood of men killed upon the spot, they left the city 
<A NAME="806"></A>at last without a government at all, to be carried about like a ship without 
<A NAME="807"></A>a pilot to steer her; while all who had any wisdom could only be thankful 
<A NAME="808"></A>if a course of such wild and stormy disorder and madness might end no worse 
<A NAME="809"></A>than in a monarchy. Some were so bold as to declare openly that the government 
<A NAME="810"></A>was incurable but by a monarchy, and that they ought to take that remedy 
<A NAME="811"></A>from the hands of the gentlest physician, meaning Pompey, who, though in 
<A NAME="812"></A>words he pretended to decline it, yet in reality made his utmost efforts 
<A NAME="813"></A>to be declared dictator. Cato, perceiving his design, prevailed with the 
<A NAME="814"></A>senate to make him sole consul, that with the offer of a more legal sort 
<A NAME="815"></A>of monarchy he might be withheld from demanding the dictatorship. They 
<A NAME="816"></A>over and above voted him the continuance of his provinces, for he had two, 
<A NAME="817"></A>Spain and all Africa, which he governed by his lieutenants, and maintained 
<A NAME="818"></A>armies under him, at the yearly charge of a thousand talents out of the 
<A NAME="819"></A>public treasury.
<A NAME="820"></A><BR><BR>Upon this Caesar also sent and petitioned for the consulship and 
<A NAME="821"></A>the continuance of his provinces. Pompey at first did not stir in it, but 
<A NAME="822"></A>Marcellus and Lentulus opposed it, who had always hated Caesar, and now 
<A NAME="823"></A>did everything, whether fit or unfit, which might disgrace and affront 
<A NAME="824"></A>him. For they took away the privilege of Roman citizens from the people 
<A NAME="825"></A>of New Comum, who were a colony that Caesar had lately planted in Gaul, 
<A NAME="826"></A>and Marcellus, who was then consul, ordered one of the senators of that 
<A NAME="827"></A>town, then at Rome, to be whipped, and told him he laid that mark upon 
<A NAME="828"></A>him to signify he was no citizen of Rome, bidding him, when he went back 
<A NAME="829"></A>again, to show it to Caesar. After Marcellus's consulship, Caesar began 
<A NAME="830"></A>to lavish gifts upon all the public men out of the riches he had taken 
<A NAME="831"></A>from the Gauls; discharged Curio, the tribune, from his great debts; gave 
<A NAME="832"></A>Paulus, then consul, fifteen hundred talents, with which he built the noble 
<A NAME="833"></A>court of justice adjoining the forum, to supply the place of that called 
<A NAME="834"></A>the Fulvian. Pompey, alarmed at these preparations, now openly took steps, 
<A NAME="835"></A>both by himself and his friends, to have a successor appointed in Caesar's 
<A NAME="836"></A>room, and sent to demand back the soldiers whom he had lent him to carry 
<A NAME="837"></A>on the wars in Gaul. Caesar returned them, and made each soldier a present 
<A NAME="838"></A>of two hundred and fifty drachmas. The officer who brought them home to 
<A NAME="839"></A>Pompey spread amongst the people no very fair or favourable report of Caesar, 
<A NAME="840"></A>and flattered Pompey himself with false suggestions that he was wished 
<A NAME="841"></A>for by Caesar's army; and though his affairs here were in some embarrassment 
<A NAME="842"></A>through the envy of some, and the ill state of the government, yet there 
<A NAME="843"></A>the army was at his command, and if they once crossed into Italy would 
<A NAME="844"></A>presently declare for him; so weary were they of Caesar's endless expeditions, 
<A NAME="845"></A>and so suspicious of his designs for a monarchy. Upon this Pompey grew 
<A NAME="846"></A>presumptuous, and neglected all warlike preparations as fearing no danger, 
<A NAME="847"></A>and used no other means against him than mere speeches and votes, for which 
<A NAME="848"></A>Caesar cared nothing. And one of his captains, it is said, who was sent 
<A NAME="849"></A>by him to Rome, standing before the senate-house one day, and being told 
<A NAME="850"></A>that the senate would not give Caesar longer time in his government, clapped 
<A NAME="851"></A>his hand on the hilt of his sword and said, "But this 
<A NAME="852"></A>shall."
<A NAME="853"></A><BR><BR>Yet the demands which Caesar made had the fairest colours of equity 
<A NAME="854"></A>imaginable. For he proposed to lay down his arms, and that Pompey should 
<A NAME="855"></A>do the same, and both together should become private men, and each expect 
<A NAME="856"></A>a reward of his services from the public. For that those who proposed to 
<A NAME="857"></A>disarm him, and at the same time to confirm Pompey in all the power he 
<A NAME="858"></A>held, were simply establishing the one in the tyranny which they accused 
<A NAME="859"></A>the other of aiming at. When Curio made these proposals to the people in 
<A NAME="860"></A>Caesar's name, he was loudly applauded, and some threw garlands towards 
<A NAME="861"></A>him, and dismissed him as they do successful wrestlers, crowned with flowers. 
<A NAME="862"></A>Antony, being tribune, produced a letter sent from Caesar on this occasion, 
<A NAME="863"></A>and read it though the consuls did what they could to oppose it. But Scipio, 
<A NAME="864"></A>Pompey's father-in-law, proposed in the senate, that if Caesar did not 
<A NAME="865"></A>lay down his arms within such a time he should be voted an enemy; and the 
<A NAME="866"></A>consuls putting it to the question, whether Pompey should dismiss his soldiers, 
<A NAME="867"></A>and again, whether Caesar should disband his, very few assented to the 
<A NAME="868"></A>first, but almost all to the latter. But Antony proposing again, that both 
<A NAME="869"></A>should lay down their commissions, all but a very few agreed to it. Scipio 
<A NAME="870"></A>was upon this very violent, and Lentulus, the consul, cried aloud, that 
<A NAME="871"></A>they had need of arms, and not of suffrages, against a robber; so that 
<A NAME="872"></A>the senators for the present adjourned, and appeared in mourning as a mark 
<A NAME="873"></A>of their grief for the dissension.
<A NAME="874"></A><BR><BR>Afterwards there came other letters from Caesar, which seemed yet 
<A NAME="875"></A>more moderate, for he proposed to quit everything else, and only to retain 
<A NAME="876"></A>Gaul within the Alps, Illyricum, and two legions, till he should stand 
<A NAME="877"></A>a second time for consul. Cicero, the orator, who was lately returned from 
<A NAME="878"></A>Cilicia, endeavoured to reconcile differences, and softened Pompey, who 
<A NAME="879"></A>was willing to comply in other things, but not to allow him the soldiers. 
<A NAME="880"></A>At last Cicero used his persuasions with Caesar's friends to accept of 
<A NAME="881"></A>the provinces and six thousand soldiers only, and so to make up the quarrel. 
<A NAME="882"></A>And Pompey was inclined to give way to this, but Lentulus, the consul, 
<A NAME="883"></A>would not hearken to it, but drove Antony and Curio out of the senate-house 
<A NAME="884"></A>with insults, by which he afforded Caesar the most plausible pretence that 
<A NAME="885"></A>could be, and one which he could readily use to inflame the soldiers, by 
<A NAME="886"></A>showing them two persons of such repute and authority who were forced to 
<A NAME="887"></A>escape in a hired carriage in the dress of slaves. For so they were glad 
<A NAME="888"></A>to disguise themselves when they fled out of Rome.
<A NAME="889"></A><BR><BR>There were not about him at that time above three hundred horse 
<A NAME="890"></A>and five thousand foot; for the rest of his army, which was left behind 
<A NAME="891"></A>the Alps, was to be brought after him by officers who had received orders 
<A NAME="892"></A>for that purpose. But he thought the first motion towards the design which 
<A NAME="893"></A>he had on foot did not require large forces at present, and that what was 
<A NAME="894"></A>wanted was to make this first step suddenly, and so to astound his enemies 
<A NAME="895"></A>with the boldness of it; as it would be easier, he thought, to throw them 
<A NAME="896"></A>into consternation by doing what they never anticipated than fairly to 
<A NAME="897"></A>conquer them, if he had alarmed them by his preparations. And therefore 
<A NAME="898"></A>he commanded his captains and other officers to go only with their swords 
<A NAME="899"></A>in their hands, without any other arms, and make themselves masters of 
<A NAME="900"></A>Ariminum, a large city of Gaul, with as little disturbance and bloodshed 
<A NAME="901"></A>as possible. He committed the care of these forces to Hortensius, and himself 
<A NAME="902"></A>spent the day in public as a stander-by and spectator of the gladiators, 
<A NAME="903"></A>who exercised before him. A little before night he attended to his person, 
<A NAME="904"></A>and then went into the hall, and conversed for some time with those be 
<A NAME="905"></A>had invited to supper, till it began to grow dusk, when he rose from table 
<A NAME="906"></A>and made his excuses to the company, begging them to stay till he came 
<A NAME="907"></A>back, having already given private directions to a few immediate friends 
<A NAME="908"></A>that they should follow him, not all the same way, but some one way, some 
<A NAME="909"></A>another. He himself got into one of the hired carriages, and drove at first 
<A NAME="910"></A>another way, but presently turned towards Ariminum. When he came to the 
<A NAME="911"></A>river Rubicon, which parts Gaul within the Alps from the rest of Italy, 
<A NAME="912"></A>his thoughts began to work, now he was just entering upon the danger, and 
<A NAME="913"></A>he wavered much in his mind when he considered the greatness of the enterprise 
<A NAME="914"></A>into which he was throwing himself. He checked his course and ordered a 
<A NAME="915"></A>halt, while he revolved with himself, and often changed his opinion one 
<A NAME="916"></A>way and the other, without speaking a word. This was when his purposes 
<A NAME="917"></A>fluctuated most; presently he also discussed the matter with his friends 
<A NAME="918"></A>who were about him (of which number Asinius Pollio was one), computing 
<A NAME="919"></A>how many calamities his passing that river would bring upon mankind, and 
<A NAME="920"></A>what a relation of it would be transmitted to posterity. At last, in a 
<A NAME="921"></A>sort of passion, casting aside calculation, and abandoning himself to what 
<A NAME="922"></A>might come, and using the proverb frequently in their mouths who enter 
<A NAME="923"></A>upon dangerous and bold attempts, "The die is cast," with these words he 
<A NAME="924"></A>took the river. Once over, he used all expedition possible, and before 
<A NAME="925"></A>it was day reached Ariminum and took it. It is said that the night before 
<A NAME="926"></A>he passed the river he had an impious dream, that he was unnaturally familiar 
<A NAME="927"></A>with his own mother.
<A NAME="928"></A><BR><BR>As soon as Ariminum was taken, wide gates, so to say, were thrown 
<A NAME="929"></A>open, to let in war upon every land alike and sea, and with the limits 
<A NAME="930"></A>of the province, the boundaries of the laws were transgressed. Nor would 
<A NAME="931"></A>one have thought that, as at other times, the mere men and women fled from 
<A NAME="932"></A>one town of Italy to another in their consternation, but that the very 
<A NAME="933"></A>towns themselves left their sites and fled for succour to each other. The 
<A NAME="934"></A>city of Rome was overrun, as it were, with a deluge, by the conflux of 
<A NAME="935"></A>people flying in from all the neighbouring places. Magistrates could not 
<A NAME="936"></A>longer govern, nor the eloquence of any orator quiet it; it was all but 
<A NAME="937"></A>suffering shipwreck by the violence of its own tempestuous agitation. The 
<A NAME="938"></A>most vehement contrary passions and impulses were at work everywhere. Nor 
<A NAME="939"></A>did those who rejoiced at the prospect of the change altogether conceal 
<A NAME="940"></A>their feelings, but when they met, as in so great a city they frequently 
<A NAME="941"></A>must, with the alarmed and dejected of the other party, they provoked quarrels 
<A NAME="942"></A>by their bold expressions of confidence in the event. Pompey, sufficiently 
<A NAME="943"></A>disturbed of himself, was yet more perplexed by the clamours of others; 
<A NAME="944"></A>some telling him that he justly suffered for having armed Caesar against 
<A NAME="945"></A>himself and the government; others blaming him for permitting Caesar to 
<A NAME="946"></A>be insolently used by Lentulus, when he made such ample concessions, and 
<A NAME="947"></A>offered such reasonable proposals towards an accommodation. Favonius bade 
<A NAME="948"></A>him now stamp upon the ground; for once talking big in the senate, he desired 
<A NAME="949"></A>them not to trouble themselves about making any preparations for the war, 
<A NAME="950"></A>for that he himself, with one stamp of his foot, would fill all Italy with 
<A NAME="951"></A>soldiers. Yet still Pompey at that time had more forces than Caesar; but 
<A NAME="952"></A>he was not permitted to pursue his own thoughts, but, being continually 
<A NAME="953"></A>disturbed with false reports and alarms, as if the enemy was close upon 
<A NAME="954"></A>him and carrying all before him, he gave way and let himself be borne down 
<A NAME="955"></A>by the general cry. He put forth an edict declaring the city to be in a 
<A NAME="956"></A>state of anarchy, and left it with orders that the senate should follow 
<A NAME="957"></A>him, and that no one should stay behind who did not prefer tyranny to their 
<A NAME="958"></A>country and liberty.
<A NAME="959"></A><BR><BR>The consuls at once fled, without making even the usual sacrifices; 
<A NAME="960"></A>so did most of the senators, carrying off their own goods in as much haste 
<A NAME="961"></A>as if they had been robbing their neighbours. Some, who had formerly much 
<A NAME="962"></A>favoured Caesar's cause, in the prevailing alarm quitted their own sentiments, 
<A NAME="963"></A>and without any prospect of good to themselves were carried along by the 
<A NAME="964"></A>common stream. It was a melancholy thing to see the city tossed in these 
<A NAME="965"></A>tumults, like a ship given up by her pilots, and left to run, as chance 
<A NAME="966"></A>guides her, upon any rock in her way. Yet, in spite of their sad condition 
<A NAME="967"></A>people still esteemed the place of their exile to be their country for 
<A NAME="968"></A>Pompey's sake, and fled from Rome, as if it had been Caesar's camp. Labienus 
<A NAME="969"></A>even, who had been one of Caesar's nearest friends, and his lieutenant, 
<A NAME="970"></A>and who had fought by him zealously in the Gallic wars, now deserted him, 
<A NAME="971"></A>and went over to Pompey. Caesar sent all his money and equipage after him, 
<A NAME="972"></A>and then sat down before Corfinium, which was garrisoned with thirty cohorts 
<A NAME="973"></A>under the command of Domitius. He, in despair of maintaining the defence, 
<A NAME="974"></A>requested a physician, whom he had among his attendants, to give him poison; 
<A NAME="975"></A>and taking the dose, drank it, in hopes of being despatched by it. But 
<A NAME="976"></A>soon after, when he was told that Caesar showed the utmost clemency towards 
<A NAME="977"></A>those he took prisoners, he lamented his misfortune, and blamed the hastiness 
<A NAME="978"></A>of his resolution. His physician consoled him by informing him that he 
<A NAME="979"></A>had taken a sleeping draught, not a poison; upon which, much rejoiced, 
<A NAME="980"></A>and rising from his bed, he went presently to Caesar and gave him the pledge 
<A NAME="981"></A>of his hand, yet afterwards again went over to Pompey. The report of these 
<A NAME="982"></A>actions at Rome quieted those who were there, and some who had fled thence 
<A NAME="983"></A>returned.
<A NAME="984"></A><BR><BR>Caesar took into his army Domitius's soldiers, as he did all those 
<A NAME="985"></A>whom he found in any town enlisted for Pompey's service. Being now strong 
<A NAME="986"></A>and formidable enough, he advanced against Pompey himself, who did not 
<A NAME="987"></A>stay to receive him, but fled to Brundusium, having sent the consuls before 
<A NAME="988"></A>with a body of troops to Dyrrhachium. Soon after, upon Caesar's approach, 
<A NAME="989"></A>he set to sea, as shall be more particularly related in his Life. Caesar 
<A NAME="990"></A>would have immediately pursued him, but wanted shipping, and therefore 
<A NAME="991"></A>went back to Rome, having made himself master of all Italy without bloodshed 
<A NAME="992"></A>in the space of sixty days. When he came thither, he found the city more 
<A NAME="993"></A>quiet than he expected, and many senators present, to whom he addressed 
<A NAME="994"></A>himself with courtesy and deference, desiring them to send to Pompey about 
<A NAME="995"></A>any reasonable accommodation towards a peace. But nobody complied with 
<A NAME="996"></A>this proposal; whether out of fear of Pompey, whom they had deserted, or 
<A NAME="997"></A>that they thought Caesar did not mean what he said, but thought it his 
<A NAME="998"></A>interest to talk plausibly. Afterwards, when Metellus, the tribune, would 
<A NAME="999"></A>have hindered him from taking money out of the public treasure, and adduced 
<A NAME="1000"></A>some laws against it, Caesar replied that arms and laws had each their 
<A NAME="1001"></A>own time; "If what I do displeases you, leave the place; war allows no 
<A NAME="1002"></A>free talking. When I have laid down my arms, and made peace, come back 
<A NAME="1003"></A>and make what speeches you please. And this," he added, "I tell you in 
<A NAME="1004"></A>diminution of my own just right, as indeed you and all others who have 
<A NAME="1005"></A>appeared against me and are now in my power may be treated as I please." 
<A NAME="1006"></A>Having said this to Metellus, he went to the doors of the treasury, and 
<A NAME="1007"></A>the keys being not to be found, sent for smiths to force them open. Metellus 
<A NAME="1008"></A>again making resistance and some encouraging him in it, Caesar, in a louder 
<A NAME="1009"></A>tone, told him he would put him to death if he gave him any further disturbance. 
<A NAME="1010"></A>"And this," said he, "you know, young man, is more disagreeable for me 
<A NAME="1011"></A>to say than to do." These words made Metellus withdraw for fear, and obtained 
<A NAME="1012"></A>speedy execution henceforth for all orders that Caesar gave for procuring 
<A NAME="1013"></A>necessaries for the war.
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR><BR>He was now proceeding to Spain, with the determination of first 
<A NAME="1015"></A>crushing Afranius and Varro, Pompey's lieutenants, and making himself master 
<A NAME="1016"></A>of the armies and provinces under them, that he might then more securely 
<A NAME="1017"></A>advance against Pompey, when he had no enemy left behind him. In this expedition 
<A NAME="1018"></A>his person was often in danger from ambuscades, and his army by want of 
<A NAME="1019"></A>provisions, yet he did not desist from pursuing the enemy, provoking them 
<A NAME="1020"></A>to fight, and hemming them with his fortifications, till by main force 
<A NAME="1021"></A>he made himself master of their camps and their forces. Only the generals 
<A NAME="1022"></A>got off, and fled to Pompey.
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR><BR>When Caesar came back to Rome, Piso, his father-in-law, advised 
<A NAME="1024"></A>him to send men to Pompey to treat of a peace; but Isauricus, to ingratiate 
<A NAME="1025"></A>himself with Caesar, spoke against it. After this, being created dictator 
<A NAME="1026"></A>by the senate, he called home the exiles, and gave back their rights as 
<A NAME="1027"></A>citizens to the children of those who had suffered under Sylla; he relieved 
<A NAME="1028"></A>the debtors by an act remitting some part of the interest on their debts, 
<A NAME="1029"></A>and passed some other measures of the same sort, but not many. For within 
<A NAME="1030"></A>eleven days he resigned his dictatorship, and having declared himself consul, 
<A NAME="1031"></A>with Servilius Isauricus, hastened again to the war. He marched so fast 
<A NAME="1032"></A>that he left all his army behind him, except six hundred chosen horse and 
<A NAME="1033"></A>five legions, with which he put to sea in the very middle of winter, about 
<A NAME="1034"></A>the beginning of the month of January (which corresponds pretty nearly 
<A NAME="1035"></A>with the Athenian month Posideon), and having passed the Ionian Sea, took 
<A NAME="1036"></A>Oricum and Apollonia, and then sent back the ships to Brundusium, to bring 
<A NAME="1037"></A>over the soldiers who were left behind in the march. They, while yet on 
<A NAME="1038"></A>the march, their bodies now no longer in the full vigour, and they themselves 
<A NAME="1039"></A>weary with such a multitude of wars, could not but exclaim against Caesar, 
<A NAME="1040"></A>"When at last, and where, will this Caesar let us be quiet? He carries 
<A NAME="1041"></A>us from place to place, and uses us as if we were not to be worn out, and 
<A NAME="1042"></A>had no sense of labour. Even our iron itself is spent by blows, and we 
<A NAME="1043"></A>ought to have some pity on our bucklers, and breastplates, which have been 
<A NAME="1044"></A>used so long. Our wounds, if nothing else, should make him see that we 
<A NAME="1045"></A>are mortal men whom he commands, subject to the same pains and sufferings 
<A NAME="1046"></A>as other human beings. The very gods themselves cannot force the winter 
<A NAME="1047"></A>season, or hinder the storms in their time; yet he pushes forward, as if 
<A NAME="1048"></A>he were not pursuing, but flying from an enemy." So they talked as they 
<A NAME="1049"></A>marched leisurely towards Brundusium. But when they came thither, and found 
<A NAME="1050"></A>Caesar gone off before them, their feelings changed, and they blamed themselves 
<A NAME="1051"></A>as traitors to their general. They now railed at their officers for marching 
<A NAME="1052"></A>so slowly, and placing themselves on the heights overlooking the sea towards 
<A NAME="1053"></A>Epirus, they kept watch to see if they could espy the vessels which were 
<A NAME="1054"></A>to transport them to Caesar.
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR><BR>He in the meantime was posted in Apollonia, but had not an army 
<A NAME="1056"></A>with him able to fight the enemy, the forces from Brundusium being so long 
<A NAME="1057"></A>in coming, which put him to great suspense and embarrassment what to do. 
<A NAME="1058"></A>At last he resolved upon a most hazardous experiment, and embarked, without 
<A NAME="1059"></A>any one's knowledge, in a boat of twelve oars, to cross over to Brundusium, 
<A NAME="1060"></A>though the sea was at that time covered with a vast fleet of the enemies. 
<A NAME="1061"></A>He got on board in the night-time, in the dress of a slave, and throwing 
<A NAME="1062"></A>himself down like a person of no consequence lay along at the bottom of 
<A NAME="1063"></A>the vessel. The river Anius was to carry them down to sea, and there used 
<A NAME="1064"></A>to blow a gentle gale every morning from the land, which made it calm at 
<A NAME="1065"></A>the mouth of the river, by driving the waves forward; but this night there 
<A NAME="1066"></A>had blown a strong wind from the sea, which overpowered that from the land, 
<A NAME="1067"></A>so that where the river met the influx of the seawater and the opposition 
<A NAME="1068"></A>of the waves it was extremely rough and angry; and the current was beaten 
<A NAME="1069"></A>back with such a violent swell that the master of the boat could not make 
<A NAME="1070"></A>good his passage, but ordered his sailors to tack about and return. Caesar, 
<A NAME="1071"></A>upon this, discovers himself, and taking the man by the hand, who was surprised 
<A NAME="1072"></A>to see him there, said, "Go on, my friend, and fear nothing; you carry 
<A NAME="1073"></A>Caesar and his fortune in your boat." The mariners, when they heard that, 
<A NAME="1074"></A>forgot the storm, and laying all their strength to their oars
