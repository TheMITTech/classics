<A NAME="2"></A><BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Such being the story of these two great men's lives, without doubt in the 
<A NAME="11"></A>comparison very little difference will be found between them. They made 
<A NAME="12"></A>war with two powerful enemies: the one against the Macedonians, and the 
<A NAME="13"></A>other with the Carthaginians; and the success was in both cases glorious. 
<A NAME="14"></A>One conquered Macedon from the seventh succeeding heir of Antigonus; the 
<A NAME="15"></A>other freed Sicily from usurping tyrants, and restored the island to its 
<A NAME="16"></A>former liberty. Unless, indeed, it be made a point of Aemilius's side, 
<A NAME="17"></A>that he engaged with Perseus when his forces were entire, and composed 
<A NAME="18"></A>of men that had often successfully fought with the Romans; whereas Timoleon 
<A NAME="19"></A>found Dionysius in a despairing condition, his affairs being reduced to 
<A NAME="20"></A>the last extremity; or, on the contrary, it be urged in favour of Timoleon, 
<A NAME="21"></A>that he vanquished several tyrants, and a powerful Carthaginian army, with 
<A NAME="22"></A>which an inconsiderable number of men gathered together from all parts, 
<A NAME="23"></A>not with such an army as Aemilius had, of well-disciplined soldiers, experienced 
<A NAME="24"></A>in war, and accustomed to obey; but with such as through the hopes of gain 
<A NAME="25"></A>restored to them, unskilled in fighting and ungovernable. And when actions 
<A NAME="26"></A>are equally glorious, and the means to compass them unequal, the greatest 
<A NAME="27"></A>esteem is certainly due to that general who conquers with the small 
<A NAME="28"></A>power.
<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR>Both have the reputation of having behaved themselves with an uncorrupted 
<A NAME="30"></A>integrity in all the affairs they managed; but Aemilius had the advantage 
<A NAME="31"></A>of being, from his infancy, by the laws and customs of his country brought 
<A NAME="32"></A>up to the proper management of public affairs, which Timoleon brought himself 
<A NAME="33"></A>to by his own efforts. And this is plain; for at that time all the Romans 
<A NAME="34"></A>were uniformly orderly and obedient, respectful to the laws and to their 
<A NAME="35"></A>fellow-citizens: whereas it is remarkable that not one of the Greek generals 
<A NAME="36"></A>commanding in Sicily could keep himself uncorrupted, except Dion, and of 
<A NAME="37"></A>him many entertained a jealousy that he would establish a monarchy there, 
<A NAME="38"></A>after the Lacedaemonian manner. Timaeus writes, that the Syracusans sent 
<A NAME="39"></A>even Gylippus home dishonourably, and with a reputation lost by the unsatiable 
<A NAME="40"></A>covetousness he displayed when he commanded the army. And numerous historians 
<A NAME="41"></A>tell us of the wicked and perfidious acts committed by Pharax the Spartan 
<A NAME="42"></A>and Callippus the Athenian, with the view of making themselves kings of 
<A NAME="43"></A>Sicily. Yet what were these men, and what strength had they, to entertain 
<A NAME="44"></A>such a thought? The first of them was a follower of Dionysius, when he 
<A NAME="45"></A>was expelled from Syracuse, and the other a hired captain of foot under 
<A NAME="46"></A>Dion, and came into Sicily with him. But Timoleon, at the request and prayers 
<A NAME="47"></A>of the Syracusans, was sent to be their general, and had no need to seek 
<A NAME="48"></A>for power, but had a perfect title, founded on their own offers, to hold 
<A NAME="49"></A>it; and yet no sooner had he freed Sicily from her oppressors, but he willingly 
<A NAME="50"></A>surrendered it.
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR>It is truly worthy our admiration in Aemilius, that though he conquered 
<A NAME="52"></A>so great and so rich a realm as that of Macedon, yet he would not touch, 
<A NAME="53"></A>nor see any of the money, nor did he advantage himself one farthing by 
<A NAME="54"></A>it, though he was very generous of his own to others. I would not intend 
<A NAME="55"></A>any reflection on Timoleon for accepting of a house and handsome estate 
<A NAME="56"></A>in the country, which the Syracusans presented him with; there is no dishonour 
<A NAME="57"></A>in accepting; but yet there is greater glory in a refusal, and the supremest 
<A NAME="58"></A>virtue is shown in not wanting what it might fairly take. And as that body 
<A NAME="59"></A>is, without doubt, the most strong and healthful which can the easiest 
<A NAME="60"></A>support extreme cold and excessive heat in the change of seasons, and that 
<A NAME="61"></A>the most firm and collected mind which is not puffed up with prosperity 
<A NAME="62"></A>nor dejected with adversity; so the virtue of Aemilius was eminently seen 
<A NAME="63"></A>in his countenance and behaviour, continuing as noble and lofty upon the 
<A NAME="64"></A>loss of two dear sons, as when he achieved his greatest victories and triumphs. 
<A NAME="65"></A>But Timoleon, after he had justly punished his brother, a truly heroic 
<A NAME="66"></A>action, let his reason yield to a causeless sorrow, and humiliated with 
<A NAME="67"></A>grief and remorse, forbore for twenty years to appear in any public place, 
<A NAME="68"></A>or meddle with any affairs of the commonwealth. It is truly very commendable 
<A NAME="69"></A>to abhor and shun the doing any base action; but to stand in fear of every 
<A NAME="70"></A>kind of censure or disrepute may argue a gentle and open-hearted, but not 
<A NAME="71"></A>an heroic temper.
