<A NAME="2"></A>
<BR>(legendary, died 395 B.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>The treasure-chamber of the Acanthians at Delphi has this inscription: 
<A NAME="11"></A>"The spoils which Brasidas and the Acanthians took from the Athenians." 
<A NAME="12"></A>And, accordingly, many take the marble statue, which stands within the 
<A NAME="13"></A>building by the gates, to be Brasidas's; but, indeed, it is Lysander's, 
<A NAME="14"></A>representing him with his hair at full length, after the old fashion, and 
<A NAME="15"></A>with an ample beard. Neither is it true, as some give out, that because 
<A NAME="16"></A>the Argives, after their great defeat, shaved themselves for sorrow, that 
<A NAME="17"></A>the Spartans contrariwise triumphing in their achievements, suffered their 
<A NAME="18"></A>hair to grow; neither did the Spartans come to be ambitious of wearing 
<A NAME="19"></A>long hair, because the Bacchiadae, who fled from Corinth to Lacedaemon, 
<A NAME="20"></A>looked mean and unsightly, having their heads all close cut. But this, 
<A NAME="21"></A>also, is indeed one of the ordinances of Lycurgus, who, as it is reported, 
<A NAME="22"></A>was used to say, that long hair made good-looking men more beautiful, and 
<A NAME="23"></A>ill-looking men more terrible.
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR>Lysander's father is said to have been Aristoclitus, who was not 
<A NAME="25"></A>indeed of the royal family but yet of the stock of the Heraclidae. He was 
<A NAME="26"></A>brought up in poverty, and showed himself obedient and conformable, as 
<A NAME="27"></A>ever any one did, to the customs of his country; of a manly spirit, also, 
<A NAME="28"></A>and superior to all pleasures, excepting only that which their good actions 
<A NAME="29"></A>bring to those who are honoured and successful; and it is accounted no 
<A NAME="30"></A>base thing in Sparta for their young men to be overcome with this kind 
<A NAME="31"></A>of pleasure. For they are desirous, from the very first, to have their 
<A NAME="32"></A>youth susceptible to good and bad repute, to feel pain at disgrace, and 
<A NAME="33"></A>exultation at being commended; and any one who is insensible and unaffected 
<A NAME="34"></A>in these respects is thought poor-spirited and of no capacity for virtue. 
<A NAME="35"></A>Ambition and the passion for distinction were thus implanted in his character 
<A NAME="36"></A>by his Laconian education, nor, if they continued there, must we blame 
<A NAME="37"></A>his natural disposition much for this. But he was submissive to great men, 
<A NAME="38"></A>beyond what seems agreeable to the Spartan temper, and could easily bear 
<A NAME="39"></A>the haughtiness of those who were in power, when it was any way for his 
<A NAME="40"></A>advantage, which some are of opinion is no small part of political discretion. 
<A NAME="41"></A>Aristotle, who says all great characters are more or less atrabilious, 
<A NAME="42"></A>as Socrates and Plato and Hercules were, writes that Lysander, not indeed 
<A NAME="43"></A>early in life, but when he was old, became thus affected. What is singular 
<A NAME="44"></A>in his character is that he endured poverty very well and that he was not 
<A NAME="45"></A>at all enslaved or corrupted by wealth, and yet he filled his country with 
<A NAME="46"></A>riches and the love of them, and took away from them the glory of not admiring 
<A NAME="47"></A>money; importing amongst them an abundance of gold and silver after the 
<A NAME="48"></A>Athenian war, though keeping not one drachma for himself. When Dionysius, 
<A NAME="49"></A>the tyrant, sent his daughters some costly gowns of Sicilian manufacture, 
<A NAME="50"></A>he would not receive them, saying he was afraid they would make them look 
<A NAME="51"></A>more unhandsome. But a while after, being sent ambassador from the same 
<A NAME="52"></A>city to the same tyrant, when he had sent him a couple of robes, and bade 
<A NAME="53"></A>him choose which of them he would, and carry to his daughter: "She," said 
<A NAME="54"></A>he, "will be able to choose best for herself," and taking both of them, 
<A NAME="55"></A>went his way.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR>The Peloponnesian war having now been carried on a long time, and 
<A NAME="57"></A>it being expected, after the disaster of the Athenians in Sicily, that 
<A NAME="58"></A>they would at once lose the mastery of the sea, and ere long be routed 
<A NAME="59"></A>everywhere, Alcibiades, returning from banishment, and taking the command, 
<A NAME="60"></A>produced a great change, and made the Athenians again a match for their 
<A NAME="61"></A>opponents by sea; and the Lacedaemonians, in great alarm at this, and calling 
<A NAME="62"></A>up fresh courage and zeal for the conflict, feeling the want of an able 
<A NAME="63"></A>commander and of a powerful armament, sent out Lysander to be admiral of 
<A NAME="64"></A>the seas. Being at Ephesus, and finding the city well affected towards 
<A NAME="65"></A>him, and favourable to the Lacedaemonian party, but in ill condition, and 
<A NAME="66"></A>in danger to become barbarized by adopting the manners of the Persians, 
<A NAME="67"></A>who were much mingled among them, the country of Lydia bordering upon them, 
<A NAME="68"></A>and the king's generals being quartered there for a long time, he pitched 
<A NAME="69"></A>his camp there, and commanded the merchant ships all about to put in thither, 
<A NAME="70"></A>and proceeded to build ships of war there; and thus restored their ports 
<A NAME="71"></A>by the traffic he created, and their market by the employment he gave, 
<A NAME="72"></A>and filled their private houses and their workshops with wealth, so that 
<A NAME="73"></A>from that time the city began, first of all, by Lysander's means, to have 
<A NAME="74"></A>some hopes of growing to that stateliness and grandeur which now it is 
<A NAME="75"></A>at.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR>Understanding that Cyrus, the king's son, was come to Sardis, he 
<A NAME="77"></A>went up to talk with him, and to accuse Tisaphernes, who, receiving a command 
<A NAME="78"></A>to help the Lacedaemonians, and to drive the Athenians from the sea, was 
<A NAME="79"></A>thought, on account of Alcibiades, to have become remiss and unwilling, 
<A NAME="80"></A>and by paying the seamen slenderly to be ruining the fleet. Now Cyrus was 
<A NAME="81"></A>willing that Tisaphernes might be found in blame, and be ill reported of, 
<A NAME="82"></A>as being, indeed, a dishonest man, and privately at feud with himself. 
<A NAME="83"></A>By these means, and by their daily intercourse together, Lysander, especially 
<A NAME="84"></A>by the submissiveness of his conversation, won the affection of the young 
<A NAME="85"></A>prince, and greatly roused him to carry on and when he would depart, Cyrus 
<A NAME="86"></A>gave him a banquet, and desired him not to refuse his goodwill, but to 
<A NAME="87"></A>speak and ask whatever he had a mind to, and that he should not be refused 
<A NAME="88"></A>anything whatsoever: "Since you are so very kind," replied Lysander, "I 
<A NAME="89"></A>earnestly request you to add one penny to the seamen's pay, that instead 
<A NAME="90"></A>of three pence, they may now receive four pence." Cyrus, delighted with 
<A NAME="91"></A>his public spirit, gave him ten thousand darics, out of which he added 
<A NAME="92"></A>the penny to the seamen's pay, and by the renown of this in a short time 
<A NAME="93"></A>emptied the ships of the enemies, as many would come over to that side 
<A NAME="94"></A>which gave the most pay, and those who remained, being disheartened and 
<A NAME="95"></A>mutinous, daily created trouble to the captains. Yet for all Lysander had 
<A NAME="96"></A>so distracted and weakened his enemies, he was afraid to engage by sea, 
<A NAME="97"></A>Alcibiades being an energetic commander, and having the superior number 
<A NAME="98"></A>of ships, and having been hitherto, in all battles, unconquered both by 
<A NAME="99"></A>sea and land.
<A NAME="100"></A><BR><BR>But afterwards, when Alcibiades sailed from Samos to Phocaea, leaving 
<A NAME="101"></A>Antiochus, the pilot, in command of all his forces, this Antiochus, to 
<A NAME="102"></A>insult Lysander, sailed with two galleys into the port of the Ephesians, 
<A NAME="103"></A>and with mocking and laughter proudly rowed along before the place where 
<A NAME="104"></A>the ships lay drawn up. Lysander, in indignation, launched at first a few 
<A NAME="105"></A>ships only and pursued him, but as soon as he saw the Athenians come to 
<A NAME="106"></A>his help, he added some other ships, and, at last, they fell to a set battle 
<A NAME="107"></A>together; and Lysander won the victory, and taking fifteen of their ships, 
<A NAME="108"></A>erected a trophy. For this, the people in the city being angry, put Alcibiades 
<A NAME="109"></A>out of command, and finding himself despised by the soldiers in Samos, 
<A NAME="110"></A>and ill spoken of, he sailed from the army into the Chersonese. And this 
<A NAME="111"></A>battle, although not important in itself, was made remarkable by its consequences 
<A NAME="112"></A>to Alcibiades.
<A NAME="113"></A><BR><BR>Lysander, meanwhile, invited to Ephesus such persons in the various 
<A NAME="114"></A>cities as he saw to be bolder and haughtier-spirited than the rest, proceeded 
<A NAME="115"></A>to lay the foundations of that government by bodies of ten, and those revolutions 
<A NAME="116"></A>which afterwards came to pass, stirring up and urging them to unite in 
<A NAME="117"></A>clubs and apply themselves to public affairs, since as soon as ever the 
<A NAME="118"></A>Athenians should be put down, the popular government, he said, should be 
<A NAME="119"></A>suppressed and they should become supreme in their several countries. And 
<A NAME="120"></A>he made them believe these things by present deeds, promoting those who 
<A NAME="121"></A>were his friends already to great employments, honours, and offices, and, 
<A NAME="122"></A>to gratify their covetousness, making himself a partner in injustice and 
<A NAME="123"></A>wickedness. So much so, that all flocked to him, and courted and desired 
<A NAME="124"></A>him, hoping, if be remained in power, that the highest wishes they could 
<A NAME="125"></A>form would all be gratified. And therefore, from the very beginning, they 
<A NAME="126"></A>could not look pleasantly upon Callicratidas, when he came to succeed Lysander 
<A NAME="127"></A>as admiral; nor, afterwards, when he had given them experience that he 
<A NAME="128"></A>was a most noble and just person, were they pleased with the manner of 
<A NAME="129"></A>his government, and its straightforward, Dorian, honest character. They 
<A NAME="130"></A>did, indeed, admire his virtue, as they might the beauty of some hero's 
<A NAME="131"></A>image; but their wishes were for Lysander's zealous and profitable support 
<A NAME="132"></A>of the interests of his friends and partisans, and they shed tears, and 
<A NAME="133"></A>were much disheartened when he sailed from them. He himself made them yet 
<A NAME="134"></A>more disaffected to Callicratidas; for what remained of the money which 
<A NAME="135"></A>had been given him to pay the navy, he sent back again to Sardis, bidding 
<A NAME="136"></A>them, if they would, apply to Callicratidas himself, and see how he was 
<A NAME="137"></A>able to maintain the soldiers. And, at the last, sailing away, he declared 
<A NAME="138"></A>to him that he delivered up the fleet in possession and command of the 
<A NAME="139"></A>sea. But Callicratidas, to expose the emptiness of these high pretensions, 
<A NAME="140"></A>said, "In that case, leave Samos on the left hand, and sailing to Miletus, 
<A NAME="141"></A>there deliver up the ships to me; for if we are masters of the sea, we 
<A NAME="142"></A>need not fear sailing by our enemies in Samos." To which Lysander answering, 
<A NAME="143"></A>that not himself but he commanded the ships, sailed to Peloponnesus, leaving 
<A NAME="144"></A>Callicratidas in great perplexity. For neither had he brought any money 
<A NAME="145"></A>from home with him, nor could he endure to tax the towns or force them, 
<A NAME="146"></A>being in hardship enough. Therefore, the only course that was to be taken 
<A NAME="147"></A>was to go and beg at the doors of the king's commanders, as Lysander had 
<A NAME="148"></A>done; for which he was most unfit of any man, being of a generous and great 
<A NAME="149"></A>spirit, and one who thought it more becoming for the Greeks to suffer any 
<A NAME="150"></A>damage from one another than to flatter and wait at the gates of barbarians, 
<A NAME="151"></A>who, indeed, had gold enough, but nothing else that was commendable. But 
<A NAME="152"></A>being compelled by necessity, he proceeded to Lydia, and went at once to 
<A NAME="153"></A>Cyrus's house, and sent in word that Callicratidas, the admiral, was there 
<A NAME="154"></A>to speak with him; one of those who kept the gates replied, "Cyrus, O stranger, 
<A NAME="155"></A>is not now at leisure, for he is drinking." To which Callicratidas answered, 
<A NAME="156"></A>most innocently, "Very well, I will wait till he has done his draught." 
<A NAME="157"></A>This time, therefore, they took him for some clownish fellow, and he withdrew, 
<A NAME="158"></A>merely laughed at by the barbarians; but when, afterwards, he came a second 
<A NAME="159"></A>time to the gate, and was not admitted, he took it hardly and set off for 
<A NAME="160"></A>Ephesus, wishing a great many evils to those who first let themselves be 
<A NAME="161"></A>insulted over by these barbarians, and taught them to be insolent because 
<A NAME="162"></A>of their riches; and added vows to those who were present, that as soon 
<A NAME="163"></A>as ever he came back to Sparta, he would do all he could to reconcile the 
<A NAME="164"></A>Greeks, that they might be formidable to barbarians, and that they should 
<A NAME="165"></A>cease henceforth to need their aid against one another. But Callicratidas, 
<A NAME="166"></A>who entertained purposes worthy a Lacedaemonian, and showed himself worthy 
<A NAME="167"></A>to compete with the very best of Greece, for his justice, his greatness 
<A NAME="168"></A>of mind and courage, not long after, having been beaten in a sea fight 
<A NAME="169"></A>at Arginusae, died.
<A NAME="170"></A><BR><BR>And now, affairs going backwards, the associates in the war sent 
<A NAME="171"></A>an embassy to Sparta, requiring Lysander to be their admiral, professing 
<A NAME="172"></A>themselves ready to undertake the business much more zealously if he was 
<A NAME="173"></A>commander; and Cyrus also sent to request the same thing. But because they 
<A NAME="174"></A>had a law which would not suffer any one to be admiral twice, and wished, 
<A NAME="175"></A>nevertheless, to gratify their allies, they gave the title of admiral to 
<A NAME="176"></A>one Aracus, and sent Lysander nominally as vice-admiral, but, indeed, with 
<A NAME="177"></A>full powers. So he came out, long wished for by the greatest part of the 
<A NAME="178"></A>chief persons and leaders in the towns, who hoped to grow to greater power 
<A NAME="179"></A>still by his means, when the popular governments should be everywhere 
<A NAME="180"></A>destroyed.
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR>But to those who loved honest and noble behaviour in their commanders, 
<A NAME="182"></A>Lysander, compared with Callicratidas, seemed cunning and subtle, managing 
<A NAME="183"></A>most things in the war by deceit, extolling what was just when it was profitable, 
<A NAME="184"></A>and when it was not, using that which was convenient, instead of that which, 
<A NAME="185"></A>was good; and not judging truth to be in nature better than falsehood, 
<A NAME="186"></A>but setting a value upon both according to interest. He would laugh at 
<A NAME="187"></A>those who thought Hercules's posterity ought not to use deceit in war: 
<A NAME="188"></A>"For where the lion's skin will not reach, you must patch it out with the 
<A NAME="189"></A>fox's." Such is the conduct recorded of him in the business about Miletus 
<A NAME="190"></A>when his friends and connections, whom he had promised, raised to assist 
<A NAME="191"></A>in suppressing popular government, and expelling their political opponents, 
<A NAME="192"></A>had altered their minds, and were reconciled to their enemies, he pretended 
<A NAME="193"></A>openly as if he was pleased with it, and was desirous to further the reconciliation, 
<A NAME="194"></A>but privately he railed at and abused them, and provoked them to set upon 
<A NAME="195"></A>the multitude. And as soon as ever he perceived a new attempt to be commencing, 
<A NAME="196"></A>he at once came up, and entered into the city, and the first of the conspirators 
<A NAME="197"></A>he lit upon, he pretended to rebuke, and spoke roughly, as if he would 
<A NAME="198"></A>punish them; but the others, meantime, he bade be courageous, and to fear 
<A NAME="199"></A>nothing, now he was with them. And all this acting and dissembling was 
<A NAME="200"></A>with the object that the most considerable men of the popular party might 
<A NAME="201"></A>not fly away, but might stay in the city and be killed; which so fell out, 
<A NAME="202"></A>for all who believed him were put to death.
<A NAME="203"></A><BR><BR>There is a saying also, recorded by Androclides, which makes him 
<A NAME="204"></A>guilty of great indifference to the obligations of an oath. His recommendation, 
<A NAME="205"></A>according to this account, was to "cheat boys with dice, and men with oaths," 
<A NAME="206"></A>an imitation of Polycrates of Samos, not very honourable to a lawful commander, 
<A NAME="207"></A>to take example, namely, from a tyrant; nor in character with Laconian 
<A NAME="208"></A>usages, to treat gods as ill as enemies, or, indeed, even more injuriously 
<A NAME="209"></A>since he who overreaches by an oath admits that he fears his enemy, while 
<A NAME="210"></A>he despises his God.
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR>Cyrus now sent for Lysander to Sardis, and gave him some money, 
<A NAME="212"></A>and promised him some more, youthfully protesting in favour to him, that 
<A NAME="213"></A>if his father gave him nothing, he would supply him of his own; and if 
<A NAME="214"></A>he himself should be destitute of all, he would cut up, he said, to make 
<A NAME="215"></A>money, the very throne upon which he sat to do justice, it being made of 
<A NAME="216"></A>gold and silver; and, at last on going up into Media to his father, he 
<A NAME="217"></A>ordered that he should receive the tribute of the towns, and committed 
<A NAME="218"></A>his government to him, and so taking his leave, and desiring him not to 
<A NAME="219"></A>fight by sea before he returned, for he would come back with a great many 
<A NAME="220"></A>ships out of Phoenicia and Cilicia, departed to visit the 
<A NAME="221"></A>king.
<A NAME="222"></A><BR><BR>Lysander's ships were too few for him to venture to fight, and 
<A NAME="223"></A>yet too many to allow of his remaining idle; he set out, therefore, and 
<A NAME="224"></A>reduced some of the islands, and wasted Aegina and Salamis; and from thence 
<A NAME="225"></A>landing in Attica, and saluting Agis, who came from Decelea to meet him, 
<A NAME="226"></A>he made a display to the land-forces of the strength of the fleet as though 
<A NAME="227"></A>he could sail where he pleased, and were absolute master by sea. But hearing 
<A NAME="228"></A>the Athenians pursued him, he fled another way through the island into 
<A NAME="229"></A>Asia. And finding the Hellespont without any defence, he attacked Lampsacus 
<A NAME="230"></A>with his ships by sea; while Thorax, acting in concert with him with the 
<A NAME="231"></A>land army, made an assault on the walls; and so having taken the city by 
<A NAME="232"></A>storm, he gave it up to his soldiers to plunder. The fleet of the Athenians, 
<A NAME="233"></A>a hundred and eighty ships, had just arrived at Elaeus in the Chersonese; 
<A NAME="234"></A>and hearing the news, that Lampsacus was destroyed, they presently sailed 
<A NAME="235"></A>to Sestos; where, taking in victuals, they advanced to Aegos Potami, over 
<A NAME="236"></A>against their enemies, who were still stationed about Lampsacus. Amongst 
<A NAME="237"></A>other Athenian captains who were now in command was Philocles, he who persuaded 
<A NAME="238"></A>the people to pass a decree to cut off the right thumb of the captives 
<A NAME="239"></A>in the war, that they should not be able to hold the spear, though they 
<A NAME="240"></A>might the oar.
<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR>Then they all rested themselves, hoping they should have battle 
<A NAME="242"></A>the next morning. But Lysander had other things in his head; he commanded 
<A NAME="243"></A>the mariners and pilots to go on board at dawn, as if there should be a 
<A NAME="244"></A>battle as soon as it was day, and to sit there in order, and without any 
<A NAME="245"></A>noise, excepting what should be commanded, and in like manner that the 
<A NAME="246"></A>land army should remain quietly in their ranks by the sea. But the sun 
<A NAME="247"></A>rising, and the Athenians sailing up with their whole fleet in line, and 
<A NAME="248"></A>challenging them to battle, though he had had his ships all drawn up and 
<A NAME="249"></A>manned before daybreak, nevertheless did not stir. He merely sent some 
<A NAME="250"></A>boats to those who lay foremost, and bade them keep still and stay in their 
<A NAME="251"></A>order; not to be disturbed, and none of them to sail out and offer battle. 
<A NAME="252"></A>So about evening, the Athenians sailing back, he would not let the seamen 
<A NAME="253"></A>go out of the ships before two or three, which he had sent to espy, were 
<A NAME="254"></A>returned, after seeing the enemies disembark. And thus they did the next 
<A NAME="255"></A>day, and the third, and so to the fourth. So that the Athenians grew extremely 
<A NAME="256"></A>confident, and disdained their enemies as if they had been afraid and daunted. 
<A NAME="257"></A>At this time, Alcibiades, who was in his castle in the Chersonese, came 
<A NAME="258"></A>on horseback to the Athenian army, and found fault with their captains, 
<A NAME="259"></A>first of all that they had pitched their camp neither well nor safely on 
<A NAME="260"></A>an exposed and open beach, a very bad landing for the ships, and secondly, 
<A NAME="261"></A>that where they were they had to fetch all they wanted from Sestos, some 
<A NAME="262"></A>considerable way off; whereas if they sailed round a little way to the 
<A NAME="263"></A>town and harbour of Sestos, they would be at a safer distance from an enemy, 
<A NAME="264"></A>who lay watching their movements, at the command of a single general, terror 
<A NAME="265"></A>of whom made every order rapidly executed. This advice, however, they would 
<A NAME="266"></A>not listen to; and Tydeus answered disdainfully, that not he, but others, 
<A NAME="267"></A>were in office now. So Alcibiades, who even suspected there must be treachery, 
<A NAME="268"></A>departed.
<A NAME="269"></A><BR><BR>But on the fifth day, the Athenians having sailed towards them, 
<A NAME="270"></A>and gone back again as they were used to do, very proudly and full of contempt, 
<A NAME="271"></A>Lysander sending some ships, as usual, to look out, commanded the masters 
<A NAME="272"></A>of them that when they saw the Athenians go to land, they should row back 
<A NAME="273"></A>again with all their speed, and that when they were about half-way across, 
<A NAME="274"></A>they should lift up a brazen shield from the fore-deck, as the sign of 
<A NAME="275"></A>battle. And he himself sailing round, encouraged the pilots and masters 
<A NAME="276"></A>of the ships, and exhorted them to keep all their men to their places, 
<A NAME="277"></A>seamen and soldiers alike, and as soon as ever the sign should be given, 
<A NAME="278"></A>to row boldly to their enemies. Accordingly, when the shield had been lifted 
<A NAME="279"></A>up from the ships, and the trumpet from the admiral's vessel had sounded 
<A NAME="280"></A>for the battle, the ships rowed up, and the foot soldiers strove to get 
<A NAME="281"></A>along by the shore to the promontory. The distance there between the two 
<A NAME="282"></A>continents is fifteen furlongs, which, by zeal and eagerness of the rowers, 
<A NAME="283"></A>was quickly traversed. Conon, one of the Athenian commanders, was the first 
<A NAME="284"></A>who saw from the land the fleet advancing, and shouted out to embark, and 
<A NAME="285"></A>in the greatest distress bade some and entreated others, and some he forced 
<A NAME="286"></A>to man the ships. But all his diligence signified nothing, because the 
<A NAME="287"></A>men were scattered about; for as soon as they came out of the ships, expecting 
<A NAME="288"></A>no such matter, some went to market, others walked about the country, or 
<A NAME="289"></A>went to sleep in their tents, or got their dinners ready, being, through 
<A NAME="290"></A>their commanders' want of skill, as far as possible from any thought of 
<A NAME="291"></A>what was to happen; and the enemy now coming up with shouts and noise, 
<A NAME="292"></A>Conon, with eight ships, sailed out, and making his escape, passed from 
<A NAME="293"></A>thence to Cyprus, to Evagoras. The Peloponnesians falling upon the rest, 
<A NAME="294"></A>some they took quite empty, and some they destroyed while they were filling; 
<A NAME="295"></A>the men, meantime coming unarmed and scattered to help, died at their ships, 
<A NAME="296"></A>or, flying by land, were slain, their enemies disembarking and pursuing 
<A NAME="297"></A>them. Lysander took three thousand prisoners, with the generals, and the 
<A NAME="298"></A>whole fleet, excepting the sacred ship Paralus, and those which fled with 
<A NAME="299"></A>Conon. So taking their ships in tow, and having plundered their tents, 
<A NAME="300"></A>with pipe and songs of victory, he sailed back to Lampsacus, having accomplished 
<A NAME="301"></A>a great work with small pains, and having finished in one hour a war which 
<A NAME="302"></A>had been protracted in its continuance, and diversified in its incidents 
<A NAME="303"></A>and in its fortunes, to a degree exceeding belief, compared with all before 
<A NAME="304"></A>it. After altering its shape and character a thousand times, and after 
<A NAME="305"></A>having been the destruction of more commanders than all the previous wars 
<A NAME="306"></A>of Greece put together, it was now put an end to by the good counsel and 
<A NAME="307"></A>ready conduct of one man.
<A NAME="308"></A><BR><BR>Some, therefore, looked upon the result as a divine intervention, 
<A NAME="309"></A>and there were certain who affirmed that the stars of Castor and Pollux 
<A NAME="310"></A>were seen on each side of Lysander's ship, when he first set sail from 
<A NAME="311"></A>the haven toward his enemies, shining about the helm; and some say the 
<A NAME="312"></A>stone which fell down was a sign of this slaughter. For a stone of a great 
<A NAME="313"></A>size did fall, according to the common belief, from heaven, at Aegos Potami, 
<A NAME="314"></A>which is shown to this day, and held in great esteem by the Chersonites. 
<A NAME="315"></A>And it is said that Anaxagoras foretold that the occurrence of a slip or 
<A NAME="316"></A>shake among the bodies fixed in the heavens, dislodging any one of them, 
<A NAME="317"></A>would be followed by the fall of the whole of them. For no one of the stars 
<A NAME="318"></A>is now in the same place in which it was at first; for they, being, according 
<A NAME="319"></A>to him, like stones and heavy, shine by the refraction of the upper air 
<A NAME="320"></A>round about them, and are carried along forcibly by the violence of the 
<A NAME="321"></A>circular motion by which they were originally withheld from falling, when 
<A NAME="322"></A>cold and heavy bodies were first separated from the general universe. But 
<A NAME="323"></A>there is a more probable opinion than this maintained by some, who say 
<A NAME="324"></A>that falling stars are no effluxes, nor discharges of ethereal fire, extinguished 
<A NAME="325"></A>almost at the instant of its igniting by the lower air; neither are they 
<A NAME="326"></A>the sudden combustion and blazing up of a quantity of the lower air let 
<A NAME="327"></A>loose in great abundance into the upper region; but the heavenly bodies, 
<A NAME="328"></A>by a relaxation of the force of their circular movement, are carried by 
<A NAME="329"></A>an irregular course, not in general into the inhabited part of the earth, 
<A NAME="330"></A>but for the most part into the wide sea; which is the cause of their not 
<A NAME="331"></A>being observed. Daimachus, in his treatise on Religion, supports the view 
<A NAME="332"></A>of Anaxagoras. He says, that before this stone fell, for seventy-five days 
<A NAME="333"></A>continually, there was seen in the heavens a vast fiery body, as if it 
<A NAME="334"></A>had been a flaming cloud, not resting, but carried about with several intricate 
<A NAME="335"></A>and broken movements, so that the flaming pieces, which were broken off 
<A NAME="336"></A>by this commotion and running about, were carried in all directions, shining 
<A NAME="337"></A>as falling stars do. But when it afterwards came down to the ground in 
<A NAME="338"></A>this district, and the people of the place recovering from their fear and 
<A NAME="339"></A>astonishment came together, there was no fire to be seen, neither any sign 
<A NAME="340"></A>of it; there was only a stone lying, big indeed, but which bore no proportion, 
<A NAME="341"></A>to speak of, to that fiery compass. It is manifest that Daimachus needs 
<A NAME="342"></A>to have indulgent hearers; but if what he says be true, he altogether proves 
<A NAME="343"></A>those to be wrong who say that a rock broken off from the top of some mountain, 
<A NAME="344"></A>by winds and tempests, and caught and whirled about like a top, as soon 
<A NAME="345"></A>as this impetus began to slacken and cease, was precipitated and fell to 
<A NAME="346"></A>the ground. Unless, indeed, we choose to say that the phenomenon which 
<A NAME="347"></A>was observed for so many days was really fire, and that the change in the 
<A NAME="348"></A>atmosphere ensuing on its extinction was attended with violent winds and 
<A NAME="349"></A>agitations, which might be the cause of this stone being carried off. The 
<A NAME="350"></A>exacter treatment of this subject belongs, however, to a different kind 
<A NAME="351"></A>of writing.
<A NAME="352"></A><BR><BR>Lysander, after the three thousand Athenians whom he had taken 
<A NAME="353"></A>prisoners were condemned by the commissioners to die, called Philocles 
<A NAME="354"></A>the general, and asked him what punishment he considered himself to deserve, 
<A NAME="355"></A>for having advised the citizens, as he had done, against the Greeks; but 
<A NAME="356"></A>he, being nothing cast down at his calamity, bade him not to accuse him 
<A NAME="357"></A>of matters of which nobody was a judge, but to do to him, now he was a 
<A NAME="358"></A>conqueror, as he would have suffered, had he been overcome. Then washing 
<A NAME="359"></A>himself, and putting on a fine cloak, he led the citizens the way to the 
<A NAME="360"></A>slaughter, as Theophrastus writes in his history. After this Lysander, 
<A NAME="361"></A>sailing about to the various cities, bade all the Athenians he met go into 
<A NAME="362"></A>Athens, declaring that he would spare none, but kill every man whom he 
<A NAME="363"></A>found out of the city, intending thus to cause immediate famine and scarcity 
<A NAME="364"></A>there, that they might not make the siege laborious to him, having provisions 
<A NAME="365"></A>sufficient to endure it. And suppressing the popular governments and all 
<A NAME="366"></A>other constitutions, he left one Lacedaemonian chief officer in every city, 
<A NAME="367"></A>with ten rulers to act with him, selected out of the societies which he 
<A NAME="368"></A>had previously formed in the different towns. And doing thus as well in 
<A NAME="369"></A>the cities of his enemies as of his associates, he sailed leisurely on, 
<A NAME="370"></A>establishing, in a manner, for himself supremacy over the whole of Greece. 
<A NAME="371"></A>Neither did he make choice of rulers by birth or by wealth, but bestowed 
<A NAME="372"></A>the offices on his own friends and partisans, doing everything to please 
<A NAME="373"></A>them, and putting absolute power of reward and punishment into their hands. 
<A NAME="374"></A>And thus, personally appearing on many occasions of blood-shed and massacre, 
<A NAME="375"></A>and aiding his friends to expel their opponents, he did not give the Greeks 
<A NAME="376"></A>a favourable specimen of the Lacedaemonian government; and the expression 
<A NAME="377"></A>of Theopompus, the comic poet, seemed but poor, when he compared the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="378"></A>to tavern women, because when the Greeks had first tasted the sweet wine 
<A NAME="379"></A>of liberty, they then poured vinegar into the cup; for from the very first 
<A NAME="380"></A>it had a rough and bitter taste, all government by the people being suppressed 
<A NAME="381"></A>by Lysander, and the boldest and least scrupulous of the oligarchical party 
<A NAME="382"></A>selected to rule the cities.
<A NAME="383"></A><BR><BR>Having spent some little time about these things, and sent some 
<A NAME="384"></A>before to Lacedaemon to tell them he was arriving with two hundred ships, 
<A NAME="385"></A>he united his forces in Attica with those of the two kings Agis and Pausanias, 
<A NAME="386"></A>hoping to take the city without delay. But when the Athenians defended 
<A NAME="387"></A>themselves, he with his fleet passed again to Asia, and in like manner 
<A NAME="388"></A>destroyed the forms of government in all the other cities, and placed them 
<A NAME="389"></A>under the rule of ten chief persons, many in every one being killed, and 
<A NAME="390"></A>many driven into exile; and in Samos he expelled the whole people, and 
<A NAME="391"></A>gave their cities to the exiles whom he brought back. And the Athenians 
<A NAME="392"></A>still possessing Sestos, he took it from them, and suffered not the Sestians 
<A NAME="393"></A>themselves to dwell in it, but gave the city and country to be divided 
<A NAME="394"></A>out among the pilots and masters of the ships under him; which was his 
<A NAME="395"></A>first act that was disallowed by the Lacedaemonians, who brought the Sestians, 
<A NAME="396"></A>back again into their country. All Greece, however, rejoiced to see the 
<A NAME="397"></A>Aeginetans, by Lysander's aid, now again, after a long time, receiving 
<A NAME="398"></A>back their cities, and the Melians and Scionaeans restored, while the Athenians 
<A NAME="399"></A>were driven out, and delivered up the cities.
<A NAME="400"></A><BR><BR>But when he now understood they were in bad case in the city because 
<A NAME="401"></A>of the famine, he sailed to Piraeus, and reduced the city, which was compelled 
<A NAME="402"></A>to surrender on what conditions he demanded. One hears it said by Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="403"></A>that Lysander wrote to the Ephors thus: "Athens is taken;" and that these 
<A NAME="404"></A>magistrates wrote back to Lysander, "Taken is enough." But this saying 
<A NAME="405"></A>was invented for its neatness' sake; for the true decree of the magistrates 
<A NAME="406"></A>was on this manner: "The government of the Lacedaemonians has made these 
<A NAME="407"></A>orders; pull down the Piraeus and the long walls; quit all the towns, and 
<A NAME="408"></A>keep to your own land; if you do these things, you shall have peace, if 
<A NAME="409"></A>you wish it, restoring also your exiles. As concerning the number of the 
<A NAME="410"></A>ships, whatsoever there be judged necessary to appoint, that do." This 
<A NAME="411"></A>scroll of conditions the Athenians accepted, Theramenes, son of Hagnon, 
<A NAME="412"></A>supporting it. At which time, too, they say that when Cleomenes, one of 
<A NAME="413"></A>the young orators, asked him how he durst act and speak contrary to Themistocles, 
<A NAME="414"></A>delivering up the walls to the Lacedaemonians, which he had built against 
<A NAME="415"></A>the will of the Lacedaemonians, he said, "O young man, I do nothing contrary 
<A NAME="416"></A>to Themistocles; for he raised these walls for the safety of the citizens, 
<A NAME="417"></A>and we pull them down for their safety; and if walls make a city happy, 
<A NAME="418"></A>then Sparta must be the most wretched of all, as it has 
<A NAME="419"></A>none."
<A NAME="420"></A><BR><BR>Lysander, as soon as he had taken all the ships except twelve, 
<A NAME="421"></A>and the walls of the Athenians, on the sixteenth day of the month Munychion, 
<A NAME="422"></A>the same on which they had overcome the barbarians at Salamis, then proceeded 
<A NAME="423"></A>to take measures for altering the government. But the Athenians taking 
<A NAME="424"></A>that very unwillingly, and resisting, he sent to the people and informed 
<A NAME="425"></A>them that he found that the city had broken the terms, for the walls were 
<A NAME="426"></A>standing when the days were past within which they should have been pulled 
<A NAME="427"></A>down. He should, therefore, consider their case anew, they having broken 
<A NAME="428"></A>their first articles. And some state, in fact, the proposal was made in 
<A NAME="429"></A>the congress of the allies, that the Athenians should all be sold as slaves; 
<A NAME="430"></A>on which occasion, Erianthus, the Theban, gave his vote to pull down the 
<A NAME="431"></A>city, and turn the country into sheep-pasture; yet afterwards, when there 
<A NAME="432"></A>was a meeting of the captains together, a man of Phocis, singing the first 
<A NAME="433"></A>chorus in Euripides's Electra, which begins-
<A NAME="434"></A><BR><BR>"Electra, Agamemnon's child, I come
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>Unto thy desert home," they were all melted with compassion, and it 
<A NAME="436"></A>seemed to be a cruel deed to destroy and pull down a city which had been 
<A NAME="437"></A>so famous, and produced such men.
<A NAME="438"></A><BR><BR>Accordingly Lysander, the Athenians yielding up everything, sent 
<A NAME="439"></A>for a number of flute-women out of the city, and collected together all 
<A NAME="440"></A>that were in the camp, and pulled down the walls, and burnt the ships to 
<A NAME="441"></A>the sound of the flute, the allies being crowned with garlands, and making 
<A NAME="442"></A>merry together, as counting that day the beginning of their liberty. He 
<A NAME="443"></A>proceeded also at once to alter the government, placing thirty rulers in 
<A NAME="444"></A>the city and ten in the Piraeus: he put, also, a garrison into the Acropolis, 
<A NAME="445"></A>and made Callibius, a Spartan, the governor of it; who afterwards taking 
<A NAME="446"></A>up his staff to strike Autolycus, the athlete, about whom Xenophon wrote 
<A NAME="447"></A>his "Banquet," on his tripping up his heels and throwing him to the ground, 
<A NAME="448"></A>Lysander was not vexed at it, but chid Callibius, telling him he did not 
<A NAME="449"></A>know how to govern freemen. The thirty rulers, however, to gain Callibius's 
<A NAME="450"></A>favour, a little after killed Autolycus.
<A NAME="451"></A><BR><BR>Lysander, after this, sails out to Thrace, and what remained of 
<A NAME="452"></A>the public money, and the gifts and crowns which he had himself received, 
<A NAME="453"></A>numbers of people, as might be expected, being anxious to make presents 
<A NAME="454"></A>to a man of such great power, who was, in a manner, the lord of Greece, 
<A NAME="455"></A>he sends to Lacedaemon by Gylippus, who had commanded formerly in Sicily. 
<A NAME="456"></A>But he, it is reported, unsewed the sacks at the bottom, took a considerable 
<A NAME="457"></A>amount of silver out of every one of them, and sewed them up again, not 
<A NAME="458"></A>knowing there was a writing in every one stating how much there was. And 
<A NAME="459"></A>coming into Sparta, what he had thus stolen away he hid under the tiles 
<A NAME="460"></A>of his house, and delivered up the sacks to the magistrates, and showed 
<A NAME="461"></A>the seals were upon them. But afterwards, on their opening the sacks and 
<A NAME="462"></A>counting it, the quantity of the silver differed from what the writing 
<A NAME="463"></A>expressed; and the matter causing some perplexity to the magistrates, Gylippus's 
<A NAME="464"></A>servant tells them in a riddle, that under the tiles lay many owls; for, 
<A NAME="465"></A>as it seems, the greatest part of the money then current bore the Athenian 
<A NAME="466"></A>stamp of the owl. Gylippus having committed so foul and base a deed, after 
<A NAME="467"></A>such great and distinguished exploits before, removed himself from 
<A NAME="468"></A>Lacedaemon.
<A NAME="469"></A><BR><BR>But the wisest of the Spartans, very much on account of this occurrence, 
<A NAME="470"></A>dreading the influence of money, as being what had corrupted the greatest 
<A NAME="471"></A>citizens, exclaimed against Lysander's conduct, and declared to the Ephors 
<A NAME="472"></A>that all the silver and gold should be sent away, as mere "alien mischiefs." 
<A NAME="473"></A>These consulted about it; and Theopompus says it was Sciraphidas, but Ephorus 
<A NAME="474"></A>that it was Phlogidas, who declared they ought not to receive any gold 
<A NAME="475"></A>or silver into the city; but to use their own country coin, which was iron, 
<A NAME="476"></A>and was first of all dipped in vinegar when it was red-hot, that it might 
<A NAME="477"></A>not be worked up anew, but because of the dipping might be hard and unpliable. 
<A NAME="478"></A>It was also, of course, very heavy and troublesome to carry, and a great 
<A NAME="479"></A>deal of it in quantity and weight was but a little in value. And perhaps 
<A NAME="480"></A>all the old money was so, coin consisting of iron, or, in some countries, 
<A NAME="481"></A>copper skewers, whence it comes that we still find a great number of small 
<A NAME="482"></A>pieces of money retain the name of obolus, and the drachma is six of these, 
<A NAME="483"></A>because so much may be grasped in one's hand. But Lysander's friends being 
<A NAME="484"></A>against it, and endeavouring to keep the money in the city, it was resolved 
<A NAME="485"></A>to bring in this sort of money to be used publicly, enacting, at the same 
<A NAME="486"></A>time, that if any one was found in possession of any privately, he should 
<A NAME="487"></A>be put to death, as if Lycurgus had feared the coin, and not the covetousness 
<A NAME="488"></A>resulting from it, which they did not repress by letting no private man 
<A NAME="489"></A>keep any, so much as they encouraged it, by allowing the state to possess 
<A NAME="490"></A>it; attaching thereby a sort of dignity to it, over and above its ordinary 
<A NAME="491"></A>utility. Neither was it possible, that what they saw so much esteemed publicly 
<A NAME="492"></A>they should privately despise as unprofitable; and that every one should 
<A NAME="493"></A>think that thing could be nothing worth for his own personal use, which 
<A NAME="494"></A>was so extremely valued and desired for the use of the state. And moral 
<A NAME="495"></A>habits, induced by public practices, are far quicker in making their way 
<A NAME="496"></A>into men's private lives, than the failings and faults of individuals are 
<A NAME="497"></A>in infecting the city at large. For it is probable that the parts will 
<A NAME="498"></A>be rather corrupted by the whole if that grows bad; while the vices which 
<A NAME="499"></A>flow from a part into the whole find many correctives and remedies from 
<A NAME="500"></A>that which remains sound. Terror and the law were now to keep guard over 
<A NAME="501"></A>the citizens' houses, to prevent any money entering into them: but their 
<A NAME="502"></A>minds could no longer be expected to remain superior to the desire of it 
<A NAME="503"></A>when wealth in general was thus set up to be striven after, as a high and 
<A NAME="504"></A>noble object. On this point, however, we have given our censure of the 
<A NAME="505"></A>Lacedaemonians in one of our other writings.
<A NAME="506"></A><BR><BR>Lysander erected out of the spoils brazen statues at Delphi of 
<A NAME="507"></A>himself, and of every one of the masters of the ships, as also figures 
<A NAME="508"></A>of the golden stars of Castor and Pollux, which vanished before the battle 
<A NAME="509"></A>at Leuctra. In the treasury of Brasidas and the Acanthians there was a 
<A NAME="510"></A>trireme made of gold and ivory, of two cubits, which Cyrus sent Lysander 
<A NAME="511"></A>in honour of his victory. But Alexandrides of Delphi write's, in his history, 
<A NAME="512"></A>that there was also a deposit of Lysander's, a talent of silver, and fifty-two 
<A NAME="513"></A>minas, besides eleven staters; a statement not consistent with the generally 
<A NAME="514"></A>received account of his poverty. And at that time, Lysander, being in fact 
<A NAME="515"></A>of greater power than any Greek before, was yet thought to show a pride, 
<A NAME="516"></A>and to affect a superiority greater even than his power warranted. He was 
<A NAME="517"></A>the first, as Duris says in his history, among the Greeks to whom the cities 
<A NAME="518"></A>reared altars as to a god, and sacrificed; to him were songs of triumph 
<A NAME="519"></A>first sung, the beginning of one of which still remains 
<A NAME="520"></A>recorded:-
<A NAME="521"></A><BR><BR>"Great Greece's general from spacious Sparta 
<A NAME="522"></A>we
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>Will celebrate with songs of victory." And the Samians decreed that 
<A NAME="524"></A>their solemnities of Juno should be called the Lysandria; and out of the 
<A NAME="525"></A>poets he had Choerilus always with him, to extol his achievements in verse; 
<A NAME="526"></A>and to Antilochus, who had made some verses in his commendation, being 
<A NAME="527"></A>pleased with them, he gave a hat full of silver; and when Antimachus of 
<A NAME="528"></A>Colophon, and one Niceratus of Heraclea competed with each other in a poem 
<A NAME="529"></A>on the deeds of Lysander, he gave the garland to Niceratus; at which Antimachus, 
<A NAME="530"></A>in vexation, suppressed his poem; but Plato, being then a young man and 
<A NAME="531"></A>admiring Antimachus for his poetry, consoled him for his defeat by telling 
<A NAME="532"></A>him that it is the ignorant who are the sufferers by ignorance, as truly 
<A NAME="533"></A>as the blind by want of sight. Afterwards, when Aristonus, the musician, 
<A NAME="534"></A>who had been a conqueror six times at the Pythian games, told him as a 
<A NAME="535"></A>piece of flattery, that if he were successful again, he would proclaim 
<A NAME="536"></A>himself in the name of Lysander, "that is," he answered," as his 
<A NAME="537"></A>slave?"
<A NAME="538"></A><BR><BR>This ambitious temper was indeed only burdensome to the highest 
<A NAME="539"></A>personages and to his equals, but through having so many people devoted 
<A NAME="540"></A>to serve him, an extreme haughtiness and contemptuousness grew up, together 
<A NAME="541"></A>with ambition, in his character. He observed no sort of moderation, such 
<A NAME="542"></A>as befitted a private man, either in rewarding or in punishing; the recompense 
<A NAME="543"></A>of his friends and guests was absolute power over cities, and irresponsible 
<A NAME="544"></A>authority and the only satisfaction of his wrath was the destruction of 
<A NAME="545"></A>his enemy; banishment would not suffice. As for example, at a later period, 
<A NAME="546"></A>fearing lest the popular leaders of the Milesians should fly, and desiring 
<A NAME="547"></A>also to discover those who lay hid, he swore he would do them no harm, 
<A NAME="548"></A>and on their believing him coming forth, he delivered them up to the oligarchical 
<A NAME="549"></A>leaders to be slain, being in all no less than eight hundred. And, indeed, 
<A NAME="550"></A>the slaughter in general of those of the popular party in the towns exceeded 
<A NAME="551"></A>all computation as he did not kill only for offences against himself, but 
<A NAME="552"></A>granted these favours without sparing, and joined in the execution of them, 
<A NAME="553"></A>to gratify the many hatreds and the much cupidity of his friends everywhere 
<A NAME="554"></A>round about him. From whence the saying of Eteocles, the Lacedaemonian, 
<A NAME="555"></A>came to be famous, that "Greece could not have borne two Lysanders." Theophrastus 
<A NAME="556"></A>says, that Archestratus said the same thing concerning Alcibiades. But 
<A NAME="557"></A>in his case what had given most offence was a certain licentious and wanton 
<A NAME="558"></A>self-will; Lysander's power was, feared and hated because of his unmerciful 
<A NAME="559"></A>disposition. The Lacedaemonians did not at all concern themselves for any 
<A NAME="560"></A>other accusers; but afterwards, when Pharnabazus, having been injured by 
<A NAME="561"></A>him, he having pillaged and wasted his country, sent some to Sparta to 
<A NAME="562"></A>inform against him, the Ephors taking it very ill, put one of his friends 
<A NAME="563"></A>and fellow-captains, Thorax, to death, taking him with some silver privately 
<A NAME="564"></A>in his possession; and they sent him a scroll, commanding him to return 
<A NAME="565"></A>home. This scroll is made up thus: When the Ephors send an admiral or general 
<A NAME="566"></A>on his way, they take two round pieces of wood, both exactly of a length 
<A NAME="567"></A>and thickness, and cut even to one another; they keep one themselves, and 
<A NAME="568"></A>the other they give to the person they send forth; and these pieces of 
<A NAME="569"></A>wood they call Scytales. When, therefore, they have occasion to communicate 
<A NAME="570"></A>any secret or important matter, making a scroll of parchment long and narrow 
<A NAME="571"></A>like a leathern thong, they roll it about their own staff of wood, leaving 
<A NAME="572"></A>no space void between, but covering the surface of the staff with the scroll 
<A NAME="573"></A>all over. When they have done this, they write what they please on the 
<A NAME="574"></A>scroll, as it is wrapped about the staff; and when they have written, they 
<A NAME="575"></A>take off the scroll, and send it to the general without the wood. He, when 
<A NAME="576"></A>he has received it, can read nothing of the writing, because the words 
<A NAME="577"></A>and letters are not connected, but all broken up; but taking his own staff, 
<A NAME="578"></A>he winds the slip of the scroll about it, so that this folding, restoring 
<A NAME="579"></A>all the parts into the same order that they were in before, and putting 
<A NAME="580"></A>what comes first into connection with what follows, brings the whole consecutive 
<A NAME="581"></A>contents to view round the outside. And this scroll is called a staff, 
<A NAME="582"></A>after the name of the wood, as a thing measured is by the name of the 
<A NAME="583"></A>measure.
<A NAME="584"></A><BR><BR>But Lysander, when the staff came to him to the Hellespont, was 
<A NAME="585"></A>troubled, and fearing Pharnabazus's accusations most, made haste to confer 
<A NAME="586"></A>with him, hoping to end the difference by a meeting together. When they 
<A NAME="587"></A>met, he desired him to write another letter to the magistrates, stating 
<A NAME="588"></A>that he had not been wronged, and had no complaint to prefer. But he was 
<A NAME="589"></A>ignorant that Pharnabazus, as it is in the proverb, played Cretan against 
<A NAME="590"></A>Cretan; for pretending to do all that was desired, openly he wrote such 
<A NAME="591"></A>a letter as Lysander wanted, but kept by him another, written privately; 
<A NAME="592"></A>and when they came to put on the seals, changed the tablets, which differed 
<A NAME="593"></A>not at all to look upon, and gave him the letter which had been written 
<A NAME="594"></A>privately. Lysander, accordingly, coming to Lacedaemon, and going, as the 
<A NAME="595"></A>custom is, to the magistrates' office, gave Pharnabazus's letter to the 
<A NAME="596"></A>Ephors, being persuaded that the greatest accusation against him was now 
<A NAME="597"></A>withdrawn; for Pharnabazus was beloved by the Lacedaemonians, having been 
<A NAME="598"></A>the most zealous on their side in the war of all the king's captains. But 
<A NAME="599"></A>after the magistrates had read the letter they showed it him, and he understanding 
<A NAME="600"></A>now that-
<A NAME="601"></A><BR><BR>"Others beside Ulysses deep can be,
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>Not the one wise man of the world is he," in extreme confusion, left 
<A NAME="603"></A>them at the time. But a few days after, meeting the Ephors, he said he 
<A NAME="604"></A>must go to the temple of Ammon, and offer the god the sacrifices which 
<A NAME="605"></A>he had vowed in war. For some state it as a truth, that when he was besieging 
<A NAME="606"></A>the city of Aphytae in Thrace, Ammon stood by him in his sleep; whereupon 
<A NAME="607"></A>raising the siege, supposing the god had commanded it, he bade the Aphytaeans 
<A NAME="608"></A>sacrifice to Ammon, and resolved to make a journey into Libya to propitiate 
<A NAME="609"></A>the god. But most were of opinion that the god was but the pretence, and 
<A NAME="610"></A>that in reality he was afraid of the Ephors, and that impatience of the 
<A NAME="611"></A>yoke at home, and dislike of living under authority, made him long for 
<A NAME="612"></A>some travel and wandering, like a horse just brought in from open feeding 
<A NAME="613"></A>and pasture to the stable, and put again to his ordinary work. For that 
<A NAME="614"></A>which Ephorus states to have been the cause of this travelling about, I 
<A NAME="615"></A>shall relate by and by.
<A NAME="616"></A><BR><BR>And having hardly and with difficulty obtained leave of the magistrates 
<A NAME="617"></A>to depart, he set sail. But the kings, while he was on his voyage, considering 
<A NAME="618"></A>that keeping, as he did, the cities in possession by his own friends and 
<A NAME="619"></A>partisans, he was in fact their sovereign and the lord of Greece, took 
<A NAME="620"></A>measures for restoring the power to the people, and for throwing his friends 
<A NAME="621"></A>out. Disturbances commencing again about these things, and, first of all, 
<A NAME="622"></A>the Athenians from Phyle setting upon their thirty rulers and overpowering 
<A NAME="623"></A>them, Lysander, coming home in haste, persuaded the Lacedaemonians to support 
<A NAME="624"></A>the oligarchies and to put down the popular governments, and to the thirty 
<A NAME="625"></A>in Athens, first of all, they sent a hundred talents for the war, and Lysander 
<A NAME="626"></A>himself, as general, to assist them. But the kings envying him, and fearing 
<A NAME="627"></A>lest he should take Athens again, resolved that one of themselves should 
<A NAME="628"></A>take the command. Accordingly Pausanias went, and in words, indeed, professed 
<A NAME="629"></A>as if he had been for the tyrant against the people, but in reality exerted 
<A NAME="630"></A>himself for peace, that Lysander might not by the means of his friends 
<A NAME="631"></A>become lord of Athens again. This he brought easily to pass; for, reconciling 
<A NAME="632"></A>the Athenians, and quieting the tumults, he defeated the ambitious hope 
<A NAME="633"></A>of Lysander, though shortly after, on the Athenians rebelling again, he 
<A NAME="634"></A>was censured for having thus taken, as it were, the bit out of the mouth 
<A NAME="635"></A>of the people, which, being freed from the oligarchy, would now break out 
<A NAME="636"></A>again into affronts and insolence; and Lysander regained the reputation 
<A NAME="637"></A>of a person who employed his command not in gratification of others, not 
<A NAME="638"></A>for applause, but strictly for the good of Sparta.
<A NAME="639"></A><BR><BR>His speech, also, was bold and daunting to such as opposed him. 
<A NAME="640"></A>The Argives, for example, contended about the bounds of their land, and 
<A NAME="641"></A>thought they brought juster pleas than the Lacedaemonians; holding out 
<A NAME="642"></A>his sword, "He," said Lysander, "that is master of this, brings the best 
<A NAME="643"></A>argument about the bounds of territory." A man of Megara, at some conference, 
<A NAME="644"></A>taking freedom with him, "This language, my friend," said he, "should come 
<A NAME="645"></A>from a city." To the Boeotians, who were acting a doubtful part, he put 
<A NAME="646"></A>the question, whether he should pass through their country with spears 
<A NAME="647"></A>upright or levelled. After the revolt of the Corinthians, when, on coming 
<A NAME="648"></A>to their walls, he perceived the Lacedaemonians hesitating to make the 
<A NAME="649"></A>assault, and a hare was seen to leap through the ditch: "Are you not ashamed," 
<A NAME="650"></A>he said, "to fear an enemy, for whose laziness the very hares sleep upon 
<A NAME="651"></A>their walls?"
<A NAME="652"></A><BR><BR>When King Agis died, leaving a brother Agesilaus, and Leontychides, 
<A NAME="653"></A>who was supposed his son, Lysander, being attached to Agesilaus, persuaded 
<A NAME="654"></A>him to lay claim to the kingdom, as being a true descendant of Hercules; 
<A NAME="655"></A>Leontychides lying under the suspicion of being the soil of Alcibiades, 
<A NAME="656"></A>who lived privately in familiarity with Timaea, the wife of Agis, at the 
<A NAME="657"></A>time he was a fugitive in Sparta. Agis, they say, computing the time, satisfied 
<A NAME="658"></A>himself that she could not have conceived by him, and had hitherto always 
<A NAME="659"></A>neglected and manifestly disowned Leontychides; but now when he was carried 
<A NAME="660"></A>sick to Heraea, being ready to die, what by importunities of the young 
<A NAME="661"></A>man himself, and of his friends, in the presence of many he declared Leontychides 
<A NAME="662"></A>to be his; and desiring those who were present to bear witness to this 
<A NAME="663"></A>to the Lacedaemonians, died. They accordingly did so testify in favour 
<A NAME="664"></A>of Leontychides. And Agesilaus, being otherwise highly reputed of and strong 
<A NAME="665"></A>in the support of Lysander, was, on the other hand, prejudiced by Diopithes, 
<A NAME="666"></A>a man famous for his knowledge of oracles, who adduced this prophecy in 
<A NAME="667"></A>reference to Agesilaus's lameness:-
<A NAME="668"></A><BR><BR>"Beware, great Sparta, lest there come of thee,
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>Though sound thyself, an halting sovereignty;
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>Troubles, both long and unexpected too,
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>And storms of deadly warfare shall ensue." When many, therefore, yielded 
<A NAME="672"></A>to the oracle, and inclined to Leontychides, Lysander said that Diopithes 
<A NAME="673"></A>did not take the prophecy rightly; for it was not that the god would be 
<A NAME="674"></A>offended if any lame person ruled over the Lacedaemonians, but that the 
<A NAME="675"></A>kingdom would be a lame one if bastards and false-born should govern with 
<A NAME="676"></A>the posterity of Hercules. By this argument, and by his great influence 
<A NAME="677"></A>among them, he prevailed, and Agesilaus was made king.
<A NAME="678"></A><BR><BR>Immediately, therefore, Lysander spurred him on to make an expedition 
<A NAME="679"></A>into Asia, putting him in hopes that he might destroy the Persians, and 
<A NAME="680"></A>attain the height of greatness. And he wrote to his friends in Asia, bidding 
<A NAME="681"></A>them request to have Agesilaus appointed to command them in the war against 
<A NAME="682"></A>the barbarians; which they were persuaded to, and sent ambassadors to Lacedaemon 
<A NAME="683"></A>to entreat it. And this would seem to be a second favour done Agesilaus 
<A NAME="684"></A>by Lysander, not inferior to his first in obtaining him the kingdom. But 
<A NAME="685"></A>with ambitious natures, otherwise not ill qualified for command, the feeling 
<A NAME="686"></A>of jealousy of those near them in reputation continually stands in the 
<A NAME="687"></A>way of the performance of noble actions; they make those their rivals in 
<A NAME="688"></A>virtue, whom they ought to use as their helpers to it. Agesilaus took Lysander, 
<A NAME="689"></A>among the thirty counsellors that accompanied him, with intentions of using 
<A NAME="690"></A>him as his especial friend; but when they were come into Asia, the inhabitants 
<A NAME="691"></A>there, to whom he was but little known, addressed themselves to him but 
<A NAME="692"></A>little and seldom; whereas Lysander, because of their frequent previous 
<A NAME="693"></A>intercourse, was visited and attended by large numbers, by his friends 
<A NAME="694"></A>out of observance, and by others out of fear; and just as in tragedies 
<A NAME="695"></A>it not uncommonly is the case with the actors, the person who represents 
<A NAME="696"></A>a messenger or servant is much taken notice of, and plays the chief part, 
<A NAME="697"></A>while he who wears the crown and scepter is hardly heard to speak, even 
<A NAME="698"></A>so was it about the counsellor, he had all the real honours of the government, 
<A NAME="699"></A>and to the king was left the empty name of power. This disproportionate 
<A NAME="700"></A>ambition ought very likely to have been in some way softened down, and 
<A NAME="701"></A>Lysander should have been reduced to his proper second place, but wholly 
<A NAME="702"></A>to cast off and to insult and affront for glory's sake one who was his 
<A NAME="703"></A>benefactor and friend was not worthy Agesilaus to allow in himself. For, 
<A NAME="704"></A>first of all, he gave him no opportunity for any action, and never set 
<A NAME="705"></A>him in any place of command; then, for whomsoever he perceived him exerting 
<A NAME="706"></A>his interest, these persons he always sent away with a refusal, and with 
<A NAME="707"></A>less attention than any ordinary suitors, thus silently undoing and weakening 
<A NAME="708"></A>his influence.
<A NAME="709"></A><BR><BR>Lysander, miscarrying in everything, and perceiving that his diligence 
<A NAME="710"></A>for his friends was but a hindrance to them, forbore to help them, entreating 
<A NAME="711"></A>them that they would not address themselves to, nor observe him, but that 
<A NAME="712"></A>they would speak to the king, and to those who could be of more service 
<A NAME="713"></A>to friends than at present he could; most, on hearing this forbore to trouble 
<A NAME="714"></A>him about their concerns, but continued their observances to him, waiting 
<A NAME="715"></A>upon him in the walks and places of exercise; at which Agesilaus was more 
<A NAME="716"></A>annoyed than ever, envying him the honour; and, finally, when he gave many 
<A NAME="717"></A>of the officers places of command and the governments of cities, he appointed 
<A NAME="718"></A>Lysander carver at his table, adding, by way of insult to the Ionians, 
<A NAME="719"></A>"Let them go now, and pay their court to my carver." Upon this, Lysander 
<A NAME="720"></A>thought fit to come and speak with him; and a brief laconic dialogue passed 
<A NAME="721"></A>between them as follows: "Truly, you know very well, O Agesilaus, how to 
<A NAME="722"></A>depress your friends;" "Those friends," replied he, "who would be greater 
<A NAME="723"></A>than myself; but those who increase my power, it is just should share in 
<A NAME="724"></A>it." "Possibly, O Agesilaus," answered Lysander, "in all this there may 
<A NAME="725"></A>be more said on your part than done on mine, but I request you, for the 
<A NAME="726"></A>sake of observers from without, to place me in any command under you where 
<A NAME="727"></A>you may judge I shall be the least offensive, and most 
<A NAME="728"></A>useful."
<A NAME="729"></A><BR><BR>Upon this he was sent ambassador to the Hellespont; and though 
<A NAME="730"></A>angry with Agesilaus, yet did not neglect to perform his duty, and having 
<A NAME="731"></A>induced Spithridates the Persian, being offended with Pharnabazus, a gallant 
<A NAME="732"></A>man, and in command of some forces, to revolt, he brought him to Agesilaus. 
<A NAME="733"></A>He was not, however, employed in any other service, but having completed 
<A NAME="734"></A>his time returned to Sparta, without honour, angry with Agesilaus, and 
<A NAME="735"></A>hating more than ever the whole Spartan government, and resolved to delay 
<A NAME="736"></A>no longer, but while there was yet time, to put into execution the plans 
<A NAME="737"></A>which he appears some time before to have concerted for a revolution and 
<A NAME="738"></A>change in the constitution. These were as follows. The Heraclidae who joined 
<A NAME="739"></A>with the Dorians, and came into Peloponnesus, became a numerous and glorious 
<A NAME="740"></A>race in Sparta, but not every family belonging to it had the right of succession 
<A NAME="741"></A>in the kingdom, but the kings were chosen out of two only, called the Eurypontidae 
<A NAME="742"></A>and the Agiadae; the rest had no privilege in the government by their nobility 
<A NAME="743"></A>of birth, and the honours which followed from merit lay open to all who 
<A NAME="744"></A>could obtain them. Lysander who was born of one of these families, when 
<A NAME="745"></A>he had risen into great renown for his exploits, and had gained great friends 
<A NAME="746"></A>and power, was vexed to see the city, which had increased to what it was 
<A NAME="747"></A>by him, ruled by others not at all better descended than himself, and formed 
<A NAME="748"></A>a design to remove the government from the two families, and to give it 
<A NAME="749"></A>in common to all the Heraclidae; or, as some say, not to the Heraclidae 
<A NAME="750"></A>only, but to all Spartans; that the reward might not belong to the posterity 
<A NAME="751"></A>of Hercules, but to those who were like Hercules, judging by that personal 
<A NAME="752"></A>merit which raised even him to the honour of the Godhead; and he hoped 
<A NAME="753"></A>that when the kingdom was thus to be competed for, no Spartan would be 
<A NAME="754"></A>chosen before himself.
<A NAME="755"></A><BR><BR>Accordingly he first attempted and prepared to persuade the citizens 
<A NAME="756"></A>privately, and studied an oration composed for this purpose by Cleon, the 
<A NAME="757"></A>Halicarnassian. Afterwards perceiving so unexpected and great an innovation 
<A NAME="758"></A>required bolder means of support, he proceeded, as it might be on the stage, 
<A NAME="759"></A>to avail himself of machinery, and to try the effects of divine agency 
<A NAME="760"></A>upon his countrymen. He collected and arranged for his purpose answers 
<A NAME="761"></A>and oracles from Apollo, not expecting to get any benefit from Cleon's 
<A NAME="762"></A>rhetoric, unless he should first alarm and overpower the minds of his fellow-citizens 
<A NAME="763"></A>by religious and superstitious terrors, before bringing them to the consideration 
<A NAME="764"></A>of his arguments. Ephorus relates, after he had endeavoured to corrupt 
<A NAME="765"></A>the oracle of Apollo, and had again failed to persuade the priestess of 
<A NAME="766"></A>Dodona by means of Pherecles, that he went to Ammon, and discoursed with 
<A NAME="767"></A>the guardians of the oracle there, proffering them a great deal of gold, 
<A NAME="768"></A>and that they, taking this ill, sent some to Sparta to accuse Lysander; 
<A NAME="769"></A>and on his acquittal the Libyans, going away, said, "You will find us, 
<A NAME="770"></A>O Spartans, better judges, when you come to dwell with us in Libya," there 
<A NAME="771"></A>being a certain ancient oracle that the Lacedaemonians should dwell in 
<A NAME="772"></A>Libya. But as the whole intrigue and the course of the contrivance was 
<A NAME="773"></A>no ordinary one, nor lightly undertaken, but depended as it went on, like 
<A NAME="774"></A>some mathematical proposition, on a variety of important admissions, and 
<A NAME="775"></A>proceeded through a series of intricate and difficult steps to its conclusion, 
<A NAME="776"></A>we will go into it at length, following the account of one who was at once 
<A NAME="777"></A>an historian and a philosopher.
<A NAME="778"></A><BR><BR>There was a woman in Pontus who professed to be pregnant by Apollo, 
<A NAME="779"></A>which many, as was natural, disbelieved, and many also gave credit to, 
<A NAME="780"></A>and when she had brought forth a man-child, several, not unimportant persons, 
<A NAME="781"></A>took an interest in its rearing and bringing up. The name given the boy 
<A NAME="782"></A>was Silenus, for some reason or other. Lysander, taking this for the groundwork, 
<A NAME="783"></A>frames and devises the rest himself, making use of not a few, nor these 
<A NAME="784"></A>insignificant champions of his story, who brought the report of the child's 
<A NAME="785"></A>birth into credit without any suspicion. Another report, also, was procured 
<A NAME="786"></A>from Delphi and circulated in Sparta, that there were some very old oracles 
<A NAME="787"></A>which were kept by the priests in private writings; and they were not to 
<A NAME="788"></A>be meddled with, neither was it lawful to read them, till one in aftertimes 
<A NAME="789"></A>should come, descended from Apollo, and, on giving some known token to 
<A NAME="790"></A>the keepers, should take the books in which the oracles were. Things being 
<A NAME="791"></A>thus ordered beforehand, Silenus, it was intended, should come and ask 
<A NAME="792"></A>for the oracles, as being the child of Apollo, and those priests who were 
<A NAME="793"></A>privy to the design were to profess to search narrowly into all particulars, 
<A NAME="794"></A>and to question him concerning his birth; and finally, were to be convinced, 
<A NAME="795"></A>and, as to Apollo's son, to deliver up to him the writings. Then he, in 
<A NAME="796"></A>the presence of many witnesses, should read, amongst other prophecies, 
<A NAME="797"></A>that which was the object of the whole contrivance, relating to the office 
<A NAME="798"></A>of the kings, that it would be better and more desirable to the Spartans 
<A NAME="799"></A>to choose their kings out of the best citizens. And now, Silenus being 
<A NAME="800"></A>grown up to a youth, and being ready for the action, Lysander miscarried 
<A NAME="801"></A>in his drama through the timidity of one of his actors, or assistants, 
<A NAME="802"></A>who just as he came to the point lost heart and drew back. Yet nothing 
<A NAME="803"></A>was found out while Lysander lived, but only after his 
<A NAME="804"></A>death.
<A NAME="805"></A><BR><BR>He died before Agesilaus came back from Asia, being involved, or 
<A NAME="806"></A>perhaps more truly having himself involved Greece, in the Boeotian war. 
<A NAME="807"></A>For it is stated both ways; and the cause of it some make to be himself, 
<A NAME="808"></A>others the Thebans, and some both together; the Thebans, on the one hand, 
<A NAME="809"></A>being charged with casting away the sacrifices at Aulis, and that being 
<A NAME="810"></A>bribed with the king's money brought by Androclides and Amphitheus, they 
<A NAME="811"></A>had, with the object of entangling the Lacedaemonians in a Grecian war, 
<A NAME="812"></A>set upon the Phocians, and wasted their country; it being said, on the 
<A NAME="813"></A>other hand, that Lysander was angry that the Thebans had preferred a claim 
<A NAME="814"></A>to the tenth part of the spoils of the war, while the rest of the confederates 
<A NAME="815"></A>submitted without complaint; and because they expressed indignation about 
<A NAME="816"></A>the money which Lysander sent to Sparta, but more especially, because from 
<A NAME="817"></A>them the Athenians had obtained the first opportunity of freeing themselves 
<A NAME="818"></A>from the thirty tyrants, whom Lysander had made, and to support whom the 
<A NAME="819"></A>Lacedaemonians issued a decree that political refugees from Athens might 
<A NAME="820"></A>be arrested in whatever country they were found, and that those who impeded 
<A NAME="821"></A>their arrest should be excluded from the confederacy. In reply to this 
<A NAME="822"></A>the Thebans issued counter decrees of their own, truly in the spirit and 
<A NAME="823"></A>temper of the actions of Hercules and Bacchus, that every house and city 
<A NAME="824"></A>in Boeotia should be opened to the Athenians who required it, and that 
<A NAME="825"></A>he who did not help a fugitive who was seized should be fined a talent 
<A NAME="826"></A>for damages, and if any one should bear arms through Boeotia to Attica 
<A NAME="827"></A>against the tyrants, that none of the Thebans should either see or hear 
<A NAME="828"></A>of it. Nor did they pass these humane and truly Greek decrees without at 
<A NAME="829"></A>the same time making their acts conformable to their words. For Thrasybulus, 
<A NAME="830"></A>and those who with him occupied Phyle, set out upon that enterprise from 
<A NAME="831"></A>Thebes, with arms and money, and secrecy and a point to start from, provided 
<A NAME="832"></A>for them by the Thebans. Such were the causes of complaint Lysander had 
<A NAME="833"></A>against Thebes. And being now grown violent in his temper through the atrabilious 
<A NAME="834"></A>tendency which increased upon him in his old age, he urged the Ephors and 
<A NAME="835"></A>persuaded them to place a garrison in Thebes, and taking the commander's 
<A NAME="836"></A>place, he marched forth with a body of troops. Pausanias, also, the king, 
<A NAME="837"></A>was sent shortly after with an army. Now Pausanias, going round by Cithaeron, 
<A NAME="838"></A>was to invade Boeotia; Lysander, meantime, advanced through Phocis to meet 
<A NAME="839"></A>him, with a numerous body of soldiers. He took the city of the Orchomenians, 
<A NAME="840"></A>who came over to him of their own accord, and plundered Lebadea. He despatched 
<A NAME="841"></A>also letters to Pausanias, ordering him to move from Plataea to meet him 
<A NAME="842"></A>at Haliartus, and that himself would be at the walls of Haliartus by break 
<A NAME="843"></A>of day. These letters were brought to the Thebans, the carrier of them 
<A NAME="844"></A>falling into the hands of some Theban scouts. They, having received aid 
<A NAME="845"></A>from Athens, committed their city to the charge of the Athenian troops, 
<A NAME="846"></A>and sallying out about the first sleep, succeeded in reaching Haliartus 
<A NAME="847"></A>a little before Lysander, and part of them entered into the city. He upon 
<A NAME="848"></A>this first of all resolved, posting his army upon a hill, to stay for Pausanias; 
<A NAME="849"></A>then as the day advanced, not being able to rest, he bade his men take 
<A NAME="850"></A>up their arms, and encouraging the allies, led them in a column along the 
<A NAME="851"></A>road to the walls. But those Thebans who had remained outside, taking the 
<A NAME="852"></A>city on the left hand, advanced against the rear of their enemies, by the 
<A NAME="853"></A>fountain which is called Cissusa; here they tell the story that the nurses 
<A NAME="854"></A>washed the infant Bacchus after birth; the water of it is of a bright wine-colour, 
<A NAME="855"></A>clear, and most pleasant to drink; and not far off the Cretan storax grows 
<A NAME="856"></A>all about which the Haliartians adduce in token of Rhadamanthus having 
<A NAME="857"></A>dwelt there, and they show his sepulchre, calling it Alea. And the monument 
<A NAME="858"></A>also of Alcmena is hard by; for there, as they say, she was buried, having 
<A NAME="859"></A>married Rhadamanthus after Amphitryon's death. But the Thebans inside the 
<A NAME="860"></A>city, forming in order of battle with the Haliartians, stood still for 
<A NAME="861"></A>some time, but on seeing Lysander with a party of those who were foremost 
<A NAME="862"></A>approaching, on a sudden opening the gates and falling on, they killed 
<A NAME="863"></A>him with the soothsayer at his side, and a few others; for the greater 
<A NAME="864"></A>part immediately fled back to the main force. But the Thebans not slackening, 
<A NAME="865"></A>but closely pursuing them, the whole body turned to fly towards the hills. 
<A NAME="866"></A>There were one thousand of them slain; there died, also, of the Thebans 
<A NAME="867"></A>three hundred, who were killed with their enemies, while chasing them into 
<A NAME="868"></A>craggy and difficult places. These had been under suspicion of favouring 
<A NAME="869"></A>the Lacedaemonians, and in their eagerness to clear themselves in the eyes 
<A NAME="870"></A>of their fellow-citizens, exposed themselves in the pursuit, and so met 
<A NAME="871"></A>their death. News of the disaster reached Pausanias as he was on the way 
<A NAME="872"></A>from Plataea to Thespiae, and having set his army in order he came to Haliartus; 
<A NAME="873"></A>Thrasybulus, also, came from Thebes, leading the Athenians.
<A NAME="874"></A><BR><BR>Pausanias proposing to request the bodies of the dead under truce, 
<A NAME="875"></A>the elders of the Spartans took it ill, and were angry among themselves, 
<A NAME="876"></A>and coming to the king, declared that Lysander should not be taken away 
<A NAME="877"></A>upon any conditions; if they fought it out by arms about his body, and 
<A NAME="878"></A>conquered, then they might bury him; if they were overcome, it was glorious 
<A NAME="879"></A>to die upon the spot with their commander. When the elders had spoken these 
<A NAME="880"></A>things, Pausanias saw it would be a difficult business to vanquish the 
<A NAME="881"></A>Thebans, who had but just been conquerors; that Lysander's body also lay 
<A NAME="882"></A>near the walls, so that it would be hard for them, though they overcame, 
<A NAME="883"></A>to take it away without a truce; he therefore sent a herald, obtained a 
<A NAME="884"></A>truce, and withdrew his forces, and carrying away the body of Lysander, 
<A NAME="885"></A>they buried it in the first friendly soil they reached on crossing the 
<A NAME="886"></A>Boeotian frontier, in the country the Panopaeans; where the monument still 
<A NAME="887"></A>stands as you go on the road from Delphi to Chaeronea. Now the army quartering 
<A NAME="888"></A>there, it is said that a person of Phocis, relating the battle to one who 
<A NAME="889"></A>was not in it, said, the enemies fell upon them just after Lysander had 
<A NAME="890"></A>passed over the Hoplites; surprised at which a Spartan, a friend of Lysander, 
<A NAME="891"></A>asked what Hoplites he meant, for he did not know the name. "It was there," 
<A NAME="892"></A>answered the Phocian, "that the enemy killed the first of us; the rivulet 
<A NAME="893"></A>by the city is called Hoplites." On hearing which the Spartan shed tears 
<A NAME="894"></A>and observed how impossible it is for any man to avoid his appointed lot; 
<A NAME="895"></A>Lysander, it appears, having received an oracle as follows:-
<A NAME="896"></A><BR><BR>"Sounding Hoplites see thou bear in mind,
<A NAME="897"></A><BR>And the earthborn dragon following behind." Some, however, say that 
<A NAME="898"></A>Hoplites does not run by Haliartus, but is a watercourse near Coronea, 
<A NAME="899"></A>falling into the river Philarus, not far from the town in former times 
<A NAME="900"></A>called Hoplias, and now Isomantus.
<A NAME="901"></A><BR><BR>The man of Haliartus who killed Lysander, by name Neochorus, bore 
<A NAME="902"></A>on his shield the device of a dragon; and this, it was supposed, the oracle 
<A NAME="903"></A>signified. It is said also that at the time of the Peloponnesian war, the 
<A NAME="904"></A>Thebans received an oracle from the sanctuary of Ismenus, referring at 
<A NAME="905"></A>once to the battle at Delium, and to this which thirty years after took 
<A NAME="906"></A>solace at Haliartus. It ran thus:-
<A NAME="907"></A><BR><BR>"Hunting the wolf, observe the utmost bound,
<A NAME="908"></A><BR>And the hill Orchalides where foxes most are found." By the words, 
<A NAME="909"></A>"the utmost bound," Delium being intended, where Boeotia touches Attica, 
<A NAME="910"></A>and by Orchalides, the hill now called Alopecus, which lies in the parts 
<A NAME="911"></A>of Haliartus towards Helicon.
<A NAME="912"></A><BR><BR>But such a death befalling Lysander, the Spartans took it so grievously 
<A NAME="913"></A>at the time, that they put the king to a trial for his life, which he not 
<A NAME="914"></A>daring to await, fled to Tegea, and there lived out his life in the sanctuary 
<A NAME="915"></A>of Minerva. The poverty also of Lysander being discovered by his death 
<A NAME="916"></A>made his merit more manifest, since from so much wealth and power, from 
<A NAME="917"></A>all the homage of the cities, and of the Persian kingdom, he had not in 
<A NAME="918"></A>the least degree, so far as money goes, sought any private aggrandizement, 
<A NAME="919"></A>as Theopompus in his history relates, whom any one may rather give credit 
<A NAME="920"></A>to when he commends than when he finds fault, as it is more agreeable to 
<A NAME="921"></A>him to blame than to praise. But subsequently, Ephorus says, some controversy 
<A NAME="922"></A>arising among the allies at Sparta, which made it necessary to consult 
<A NAME="923"></A>the writings which Lysander had kept by him, Agesilaus came to his house, 
<A NAME="924"></A>and finding the book in which the oration on the Spartan constitution was 
<A NAME="925"></A>written at length, to the effect that the kingdom ought to be taken from 
<A NAME="926"></A>the Eurypontidae and Agiadae, and to be offered in common, and a choice 
<A NAME="927"></A>made out of the best citizens, at first he was eager to make it public, 
<A NAME="928"></A>and to show his countrymen the real character of Lysander. But Lacratidas, 
<A NAME="929"></A>a wise man, and at that time chief of the Ephors, hindered Agesilaus, and 
<A NAME="930"></A>said they ought not to dig up Lysander again, but rather to bury with him 
<A NAME="931"></A>a discourse, composed so plausibly and subtilely. Other honours, also, 
<A NAME="932"></A>were paid him, after his death; and amongst these they imposed a fine upon 
<A NAME="933"></A>those who had engaged themselves to marry his daughters, and then when 
<A NAME="934"></A>Lysander was found to be poor, after his decease, refused them; because 
<A NAME="935"></A>when they thought him rich they had been observant of him, but now his 
<A NAME="936"></A>poverty had proved him just and good, they forsook him. For there was, 
<A NAME="937"></A>it seems, in Sparta, a punishment for not marrying, for a late, and for 
<A NAME="938"></A>a bad marriage; and to the last penalty those were most especially liable 
<A NAME="939"></A>who sought alliances with the rich instead of with the good and with their 
<A NAME="940"></A>friends. Such is the account we have found given of 
<A NAME="941"></A>Lysander.
