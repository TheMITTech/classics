<BR>(legendary, died 317 B.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Demades, the orator, when in the height of the power which he obtained 
<A NAME="11"></A>at Athens, by advising the state in the interest of Antipater and the Macedonians, 
<A NAME="12"></A>being necessitated to write and speak many things below the dignity, and 
<A NAME="13"></A>contrary to the character, of the city, was wont to excuse himself by saying 
<A NAME="14"></A>he steered only the shipwrecks of the commonwealth. This hardy saying of 
<A NAME="15"></A>his might have some appearance of truth, if applied to Phocion's government. 
<A NAME="16"></A>For Demades, indeed, was himself the mere wreck of his country, living 
<A NAME="17"></A>and ruling so dissolutely, that Antipater took occasion to say of him, 
<A NAME="18"></A>when he was now grown old, that he was like a sacrificed beast, all consumed 
<A NAME="19"></A>except the tongue and the belly. But Phocion's was a real virtue, only 
<A NAME="20"></A>overmatched in the unequal contest with an adverse time, and rendered, 
<A NAME="21"></A>by the ill fortunes of Greece, inglorious and obscure. We must not, indeed, 
<A NAME="22"></A>allow ourselves to concur with Sophocles in so far diminishing the force 
<A NAME="23"></A>of virtue as to say that-
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR>"When fortune fails, the sense we had before
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>Deserts us also, and is ours no more."
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR>Yet thus much, indeed, must be allowed to happen in the conflicts 
<A NAME="27"></A>between good men and ill fortune, that instead of due returns of honour 
<A NAME="28"></A>and gratitude, obloquy and unjust surmises may often prevail, to weaken, 
<A NAME="29"></A>in a considerable degree, the credit of their virtue.
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>It is commonly said that public bodies are most insulting and contumelious 
<A NAME="31"></A>to a good man, when they are puffed up with prosperity and success. But 
<A NAME="32"></A>the contrary often happens; afflictions and public calamities naturally 
<A NAME="33"></A>embittering and souring the minds and tempers of men, and disposing them 
<A NAME="34"></A>to such peevishness and irritability that hardly any word or sentiment 
<A NAME="35"></A>of common vigour can be addressed to them, but they will be apt to take 
<A NAME="36"></A>offence. He that remonstrates with them on their errors is presumed to 
<A NAME="37"></A>be insulting over their misfortunes, and any free-spoken expostulation 
<A NAME="38"></A>is construed into contempt. Honey itself is searching in sore and ulcerated 
<A NAME="39"></A>parts; and the wisest and most judicious counsels prove provoking to distempered 
<A NAME="40"></A>minds, unless offered with those soothing and compliant approaches which 
<A NAME="41"></A>made the poet, for instance, characterize agreeable things in general by 
<A NAME="42"></A>a word expressive of a grateful and easy touch, exciting nothing of offence 
<A NAME="43"></A>or resistance. Inflamed eyes require a retreat into dusky places, amongst 
<A NAME="44"></A>colours of the deepest shades, and are unable to endure the brilliancy 
<A NAME="45"></A>of light. So fares it in the body politic, in times of distress and humiliation; 
<A NAME="46"></A>a certain sensitiveness and soreness of humour prevail, with a weak incapacity 
<A NAME="47"></A>of enduring any free and open advice, even when the necessity of affairs 
<A NAME="48"></A>most requires such plain dealing, and when the consequences of any single 
<A NAME="49"></A>error may be beyond retrieving. At such times the conduct of public affairs 
<A NAME="50"></A>is on all hands most hazardous. Those who humour the people are swallowed 
<A NAME="51"></A>up in the common ruin; those who endeavour to lead them aright perish the 
<A NAME="52"></A>first in their attempt.
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR>Astronomers tell us, the sun's motion is neither exactly parallel 
<A NAME="54"></A>with that of the heavens in general, nor yet directly and diametrically 
<A NAME="55"></A>opposite, but describing an oblique line, with insensible declination he 
<A NAME="56"></A>steers his course in such a gentle, easy curve, as to dispense his light 
<A NAME="57"></A>and influence, in his annual revolution, at several seasons in just proportions 
<A NAME="58"></A>to the whole creation. So it happens in political affairs; if the motions 
<A NAME="59"></A>of rulers be constantly opposite and cross to the tempers and inclinations 
<A NAME="60"></A>of the people, they will be resented as arbitrary and harsh; as, on the 
<A NAME="61"></A>other side, too much deference, or encouragement, as too often it has been, 
<A NAME="62"></A>to popular faults and errors, is full of danger and ruinous consequences. 
<A NAME="63"></A>But where concession is the response to willing obedience, and a statesman 
<A NAME="64"></A>gratifies his people, that he may the more imperatively recall them to 
<A NAME="65"></A>a sense of the common interest, then, indeed, human beings, who are ready 
<A NAME="66"></A>enough to serve well and submit to much, if they are not always ordered 
<A NAME="67"></A>about and roughly handled, like slaves, may be said to be guided and governed 
<A NAME="68"></A>upon the method that leads to safety. Though it must be confessed it is 
<A NAME="69"></A>a nice point, and extremely difficult, so to temper this lenity as to preserve 
<A NAME="70"></A>the authority of the government. But if such a blessed mixture and temperament 
<A NAME="71"></A>may be obtained, it seems to be of all concords and harmonies the most 
<A NAME="72"></A>concordant and most harmonious. For thus we are taught even God governs 
<A NAME="73"></A>the world, not by irresistible force, but persuasive argument and reason, 
<A NAME="74"></A>controlling it into compliance with his eternal purposes.
<A NAME="75"></A><BR><BR>Cato the younger is a similar instance. His manners were little 
<A NAME="76"></A>agreeable or acceptable to the people, and he received very slender marks 
<A NAME="77"></A>of their favour; witness his repulse when he sued for the consulship, which 
<A NAME="78"></A>he lost, as Cicero says, for acting rather like a citizen in Plato's commonwealth, 
<A NAME="79"></A>than among the dregs of Romulus's posterity, the same thing happening to 
<A NAME="80"></A>him, in my opinion, as we observe in fruits ripe before their season, which 
<A NAME="81"></A>we rather take pleasure in looking at and admiring than actually use; so 
<A NAME="82"></A>much was his old-fashioned virtue out of the present mode, among the depraved 
<A NAME="83"></A>customs which time and luxury had introduced, that it appeared, indeed, 
<A NAME="84"></A>remarkable and wonderful, but was too great and too good to suit the present 
<A NAME="85"></A>exigencies, being so out of all proportion to the times. Yet his circumstances 
<A NAME="86"></A>were not altogether like Phocion's, who came to the helm when the ship 
<A NAME="87"></A>of the state was just upon sinking. Cato's time was, indeed, stormy and 
<A NAME="88"></A>tempestuous, yet so, as he was able to assist in managing the sails, and 
<A NAME="89"></A>lend his helping hand to those who, which he was not allowed to do, commanded 
<A NAME="90"></A>at the helm, others were to blame for the result; yet his courage and virtue 
<A NAME="91"></A>made it in spite of all a hard task for fortune to ruin the commonwealth, 
<A NAME="92"></A>and it was only with long time and effort and by slow degrees, when he 
<A NAME="93"></A>himself had all but succeeded in averting it, that the catastrophe was 
<A NAME="94"></A>at last effected.
<A NAME="95"></A><BR><BR>Phocion and he may be well compared together, not for any mere 
<A NAME="96"></A>general resemblances, as though we should say both were good men and great 
<A NAME="97"></A>statesmen. For, assuredly, there is difference enough among virtues of 
<A NAME="98"></A>the same denomination, as between the bravery of Alcibiades and that of 
<A NAME="99"></A>Epaminondas, the prudence of Themistocles and that of Aristides, the justice 
<A NAME="100"></A>of Numa and that of Agesilaus. But these men's virtue, even looking to 
<A NAME="101"></A>the most minute points of difference, bear the same colour, stamp, and 
<A NAME="102"></A>character impressed upon them, so as not to be distinguishable. The mixture 
<A NAME="103"></A>is still made in the same exact proportions whether we look at the combination 
<A NAME="104"></A>to be found in them, both of lenity on the one hand, with austerity on 
<A NAME="105"></A>the other; their boldness upon some occasions, and caution on others; their 
<A NAME="106"></A>extreme solicitude for the public, and perfect neglect of themselves; their 
<A NAME="107"></A>fixed and immovable bent to all virtuous and honest actions, accompanied 
<A NAME="108"></A>with an extreme tenderness and scrupulosity as to doing anything which 
<A NAME="109"></A>might appear mean or unworthy; so that we should need a very nice and subtle 
<A NAME="110"></A>logic of discrimination to detect and establish the distinctions between 
<A NAME="111"></A>them.
<A NAME="112"></A><BR><BR>As to Cato's extraction, it is confessed by all to have been illustrious, 
<A NAME="113"></A>as will be said hereafter, nor was Phocion's, I feel assured, obscure or 
<A NAME="114"></A>ignoble. For had he been the son of a turner, as Idomeneus reports, it 
<A NAME="115"></A>had certainly not been forgotten to his disparagement by Glaucippus, the 
<A NAME="116"></A>son of Hyperides, when heaping up a thousand spiteful things to say against 
<A NAME="117"></A>him. Nor, indeed, had it been possible for him, in such circumstances, 
<A NAME="118"></A>to have had such a liberal breeding and education in his youth, as to be 
<A NAME="119"></A>first Plato's and afterwards Xenocrates's scholar in the Academy, and to 
<A NAME="120"></A>have devoted himself from the first to the pursuit of the noblest studies 
<A NAME="121"></A>and practices. His countenance was so composed that scarcely was he ever 
<A NAME="122"></A>seen by any Athenian either laughing or in tears. He was rarely known, 
<A NAME="123"></A>so Duris has recorded, to appear in the public baths, or was observed with 
<A NAME="124"></A>his hand exposed outside his cloak, when he wore one. Abroad, and in the 
<A NAME="125"></A>camp, he was so hardy in going always thin clad and barefoot, except in 
<A NAME="126"></A>a time of excessive and intolerable cold, that the soldiers used to say 
<A NAME="127"></A>in merriment, that it was like to be a hard winter when Phocion wore his 
<A NAME="128"></A>coat.
<A NAME="129"></A><BR><BR>Although he was most gentle and humane in his disposition, his 
<A NAME="130"></A>aspect was stern and forbidding, so that he was seldom accosted alone by 
<A NAME="131"></A>any who were not intimate with him. When Chares once made some remark on 
<A NAME="132"></A>his frowning looks, and the Athenians laughed at the jest, "My sullenness," 
<A NAME="133"></A>said Phocion, "never yet made any of you sad, but these men's jollities 
<A NAME="134"></A>have given you sorrow enough." In like manner Phocion's language, also, 
<A NAME="135"></A>was full of instruction, abounding in happy maxims and wise thoughts, but 
<A NAME="136"></A>admitted no embellishment to its austere and commanding brevity. Zeno said 
<A NAME="137"></A>a philosopher should never speak till his words had been steeped in meaning; 
<A NAME="138"></A>and such, it may be said, were Phocion's, crowding the greatest amount 
<A NAME="139"></A>of significance into the smallest allowance of space. And to this, probably, 
<A NAME="140"></A>Polyeuctus, the Sphettian, referred, when he said that Demosthenes was, 
<A NAME="141"></A>indeed, the best orator of his time, but Phocion the most powerful speaker. 
<A NAME="142"></A>His oratory, like small coin of great value, was to be estimated, not by 
<A NAME="143"></A>its bulk, but its intrinsic worth. He was once observed, it is said, when 
<A NAME="144"></A>the theatre was filling with the audience, to walk musing alone behind 
<A NAME="145"></A>the scenes, which one of his friends taking notice of said, "Phocion, you 
<A NAME="146"></A>seem to be thoughtful." "Yes," replied he, "I am considering how I may 
<A NAME="147"></A>shorten what I am going to say to the Athenians." Even Demosthenes himself, 
<A NAME="148"></A>who used to despise the rest of the haranguers, when Phocion stood up, 
<A NAME="149"></A>was wont to say quietly to those about him, "Here is the pruning-knife 
<A NAME="150"></A>of my periods." This, however, might refer, perhaps, not so much to his 
<A NAME="151"></A>eloquence as to the influence of his character, since not only a word, 
<A NAME="152"></A>but even a nod from a person who is esteemed, is of more force than a thousand 
<A NAME="153"></A>arguments or studied sentences from others.
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR>In his youth he followed Chabrias, the general, from whom he gained 
<A NAME="155"></A>many lessons in military knowledge, and in return did something to correct 
<A NAME="156"></A>his unequal and capricious humour. For whereas at other times Chabrias 
<A NAME="157"></A>was heavy and phlegmatic, in the heat of battle he used to be so fired 
<A NAME="158"></A>and transported that he threw himself headlong into danger beyond the forwardest, 
<A NAME="159"></A>which indeed, in the end, cost him his life in the island of Chios, he 
<A NAME="160"></A>having pressed his own ship foremost to force a landing. But Phocion, being 
<A NAME="161"></A>a man of temper as well as courage, had the dexterity at some times to 
<A NAME="162"></A>rouse the general, when in his procrastinating mood, to action, and at 
<A NAME="163"></A>others to moderate and cool the impetuousness of his unseasonable fury. 
<A NAME="164"></A>Upon which account Chabrias, who was a good-natured, kindly-tempered man, 
<A NAME="165"></A>loved him much, and procured him commands and opportunities for action, 
<A NAME="166"></A>giving him means to make himself known in Greece, and using his assistance 
<A NAME="167"></A>in all his affairs of moment. Particularly the sea-fight of Naxos added 
<A NAME="168"></A>not a little to Phocion's reputation, when he had the left squadron committed 
<A NAME="169"></A>to him by Chabrias, as in this quarter the battle was sharply contested, 
<A NAME="170"></A>and was decided by a speedy victory. And this being the first prosperous 
<A NAME="171"></A>sea-battle the city had engaged in with its own force since its captivity, 
<A NAME="172"></A>Chabrias won great popularity by it, and Phocion, also, got the reputation 
<A NAME="173"></A>of a good commander. The victory was gained at the time of the Great Mysteries, 
<A NAME="174"></A>and Chabrias used to keep the commemoration of it by distributing wine 
<A NAME="175"></A>among the Athenians, yearly, on the sixteenth day of 
<A NAME="176"></A>Boedromion.
<A NAME="177"></A><BR><BR>After this, Chabrias sent Phocion to demand their quota of the 
<A NAME="178"></A>charges of the war from the islanders, and offered him a guard of twenty 
<A NAME="179"></A>ships. Phocion told him, if he intended him to go against them as enemies, 
<A NAME="180"></A>that force was insignificant; if as to friends and allies, one vessel was 
<A NAME="181"></A>sufficient. So he took his own single galley, and having visited the cities, 
<A NAME="182"></A>and treated with the magistrates in an equitable and open manner, he brought 
<A NAME="183"></A>back a number of ships, sent by the confederates to Athens, to convey the 
<A NAME="184"></A>supplies. Neither did his friendship and attention close with Chabrias's 
<A NAME="185"></A>life, but after his decease he carefully maintained it to all that were 
<A NAME="186"></A>related to him, and chiefly to his son, Ctesippus, whom he laboured to 
<A NAME="187"></A>bring to some good, and although he was a stupid and intractable young 
<A NAME="188"></A>fellow, always endeavoured, so far as in him lay, to correct and cover 
<A NAME="189"></A>his faults and follies. Once, however, when the youngster was very impertinent 
<A NAME="190"></A>and troublesome to him in the camp, interrupting him with idle questions, 
<A NAME="191"></A>and putting forward his opinions and suggestions of how the war should 
<A NAME="192"></A>be conducted, he could not forbear exclaiming, "O Chabrias, Chabrias, how 
<A NAME="193"></A>grateful I show myself for your friendship, in submitting to endure your 
<A NAME="194"></A>son!"
<A NAME="195"></A><BR><BR>Upon looking into public matters, and the way in which they were 
<A NAME="196"></A>now conducted, he observed that the administration of affairs was cut and 
<A NAME="197"></A>parcelled out, like so much land by allotment, between the military men 
<A NAME="198"></A>and the public speakers, so that neither these nor those should interfere 
<A NAME="199"></A>with the claims of the others. As the one were to address the assemblies, 
<A NAME="200"></A>to draw up votes and prepare motions, men, for example, like Eubulus, Aristophon, 
<A NAME="201"></A>Demosthenes, Lycurgus, and Hyperides, and were to push their interests 
<A NAME="202"></A>here; so, in the meantime, Liopithes, Menestheus, Leosthenes, and Chares 
<A NAME="203"></A>were to make their profit by war and in military commands. Phocion, on 
<A NAME="204"></A>the other hand, was desirous to restore and carry out the old system, more 
<A NAME="205"></A>complete in itself, and more harmonious and uniform, which prevailed in 
<A NAME="206"></A>the times of Pericles, Aristides, and Solon; when statesmen showed themselves, 
<A NAME="207"></A>to use Archilochus's words-
<A NAME="208"></A><BR><BR>"Mars' and the Muses' friends alike designed,
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>To arts and arms indifferently inclined."
<A NAME="210"></A><BR><BR>and the presiding goddess of his country was, he did not fail to 
<A NAME="211"></A>see, the patroness and protectress of both civil and military wisdom. With 
<A NAME="212"></A>these views, while his advice at home was always for peace and quietness, 
<A NAME="213"></A>he nevertheless held the office of general more frequently than any of 
<A NAME="214"></A>the statesmen, not only of his own times, but of those preceding, never, 
<A NAME="215"></A>indeed, promoting or encouraging military expeditions, yet never, on the 
<A NAME="216"></A>other hand, shunning or declining, when he was called upon by the public 
<A NAME="217"></A>voice. Thus much is well known, that he was no less than forty-five several 
<A NAME="218"></A>times chosen general, he being never on any one of those occasions present 
<A NAME="219"></A>at the election, but having the command, in his absence, by common suffrage, 
<A NAME="220"></A>conferred on him, and he sent for on purpose to undertake it. Insomuch 
<A NAME="221"></A>that it amazed those who did not well consider to see the people always 
<A NAME="222"></A>prefer Phocion, who was so far from humouring them or courting their favour, 
<A NAME="223"></A>that be always thwarted and opposed them. But so it was, as great men and 
<A NAME="224"></A>princes are said to call in their flatterers when dinner has been served, 
<A NAME="225"></A>so the Athenians, upon slight occasions, entertained and diverted themselves 
<A NAME="226"></A>with their spruce speakers and trim orators, but when it came to action, 
<A NAME="227"></A>they were sober and considerate enough to single out the austerest and 
<A NAME="228"></A>wisest for public employment, however much he might be opposed to their 
<A NAME="229"></A>wishes and sentiments. This, indeed, he made no scruple to admit, when 
<A NAME="230"></A>the oracle from Delphi was read, which informed them that the Athenians 
<A NAME="231"></A>were all of one mind, a single dissentient only excepted, frankly coming 
<A NAME="232"></A>forward and declaring that they need look no further; he was the man; there 
<A NAME="233"></A>was no one but he who was dissatisfied with everything they did. And when 
<A NAME="234"></A>once he gave his opinion to the people, and was met with the general approbation 
<A NAME="235"></A>and applause of the assembly, turning to some of his friends, he asked 
<A NAME="236"></A>them, "Have I inadvertently said something foolish?"
<A NAME="237"></A><BR><BR>Upon occasion of a public festivity, being solicited for his contribution 
<A NAME="238"></A>by the example of others, and the people pressing him much, he bade them 
<A NAME="239"></A>apply themselves to the wealthy; for his part he should blush to make a 
<A NAME="240"></A>present here, rather than a repayment there, turning and pointing to Callicles, 
<A NAME="241"></A>the money-lender. Being still clamoured upon and importuned, he told them 
<A NAME="242"></A>this tale. A certain cowardly fellow setting out for the wars, hearing 
<A NAME="243"></A>the ravens croak in his passage, threw down his arms, resolving to wait. 
<A NAME="244"></A>Presently he took them and ventured out again, but hearing the same music, 
<A NAME="245"></A>once more made a stop. "For," said he "you may croak until you are tired, 
<A NAME="246"></A>but you shall make no dinner upon me."
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR>The Athenians urging him at an unseasonable time to lead them out 
<A NAME="248"></A>against the enemy, he peremptorily refused, and being upbraided by them 
<A NAME="249"></A>with cowardice and pusillanimity, he told them, "Just now, do what you 
<A NAME="250"></A>will, I shall not be brave; and do what I will, you will not be cowards. 
<A NAME="251"></A>Nevertheless, we know well enough what we are." And when again, in a time 
<A NAME="252"></A>of great danger, the people were very harsh upon him, demanding a strict 
<A NAME="253"></A>account how the public money had been employed, and the like, he bade them, 
<A NAME="254"></A>"First, good friends, make sure you are safe." After a war, during which 
<A NAME="255"></A>they had been very tractable and timorous, when, upon peace being made, 
<A NAME="256"></A>they began again to be confident and overbearing, and to cry out upon Phocion, 
<A NAME="257"></A>as having lost them the honour of victory, to all their clamour he made 
<A NAME="258"></A>only this answer, "My friends, you are fortunate in having a leader who 
<A NAME="259"></A>knows you; otherwise, you had long since been undone."
<A NAME="260"></A><BR><BR>Having a controversy with the Boeotians about boundaries, which 
<A NAME="261"></A>he counselled them to decide by negotiation, they inclined to blows. "You 
<A NAME="262"></A>had better," said he, "carry on the contest with the weapons in which you 
<A NAME="263"></A>excel (your tongues), and not by war, in which you are inferior." Once 
<A NAME="264"></A>when he was addressing them, and they would not hear him or let him go 
<A NAME="265"></A>on, said he, "You may compel me to act against my wishes, but you shall 
<A NAME="266"></A>never force me to speak against my judgment." Among the many public speakers 
<A NAME="267"></A>who opposed him, Demosthenes, for example, once told him, "The Athenians, 
<A NAME="268"></A>Phocion, will kill you some day when they once are in a rage." "And you," 
<A NAME="269"></A>said he, "if they once are in their senses." Polyeuctus, the Sphettian, 
<A NAME="270"></A>once on a hot day was urging war with Philip, and being a corpulent man, 
<A NAME="271"></A>and out of breath and in a great heat with speaking, took numerous draughts 
<A NAME="272"></A>of water as he went on. "Here, indeed," said Phocion, "is a fit man to 
<A NAME="273"></A>lead us into a war! What think you he will do when he is carrying his corselet 
<A NAME="274"></A>and his shield to meet the enemy, if even here, delivering a prepared speech 
<A NAME="275"></A>to you, has almost killed him with exhaustion?" When Lycurgus in the assembly 
<A NAME="276"></A>made many reflections on his past conduct, upbraiding him above all for 
<A NAME="277"></A>having advised them to deliver up the ten citizens whom Alexander had demanded, 
<A NAME="278"></A>he replied that he had been the author of much safe and wholesome counsel, 
<A NAME="279"></A>which had not been followed.
<A NAME="280"></A><BR><BR>There was a man called Archibiades, nicknamed the Lacedaemonian, 
<A NAME="281"></A>who used to go about with a huge, over-grown beard, wearing an old threadbare 
<A NAME="282"></A>cloak, and affecting a very stern countenance. Phocion once, when attacked 
<A NAME="283"></A>in council by the rest, appealed to this man for his support and testimony. 
<A NAME="284"></A>And when he got up and began to speak on the popular side, putting his 
<A NAME="285"></A>hand to his beard, "O Archibiades," said he, "it is time you should shave." 
<A NAME="286"></A>Aristogiton, a common accuser, was a terrible man of war within the assembly, 
<A NAME="287"></A>always inflaming the people to battle, but when the muster-roll came to 
<A NAME="288"></A>be produced, he appeared limping on a crutch, with a bandage on his leg; 
<A NAME="289"></A>Phocion descried him afar off, coming in, and cried out to the clerk, "Put 
<A NAME="290"></A>down Aristogiton, too, as lame and worthless."
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR>So that it is a little wonderful, how a man so severe and harsh 
<A NAME="292"></A>upon all occasions should, notwithstanding, obtain the name of the Good. 
<A NAME="293"></A>Yet, though difficult, it is not, I suppose, impossible for men's tempers, 
<A NAME="294"></A>any more than for wines, to be at the same time harsh and agreeable to 
<A NAME="295"></A>the taste; just as on the other hand many that are sweet at the first taste 
<A NAME="296"></A>are found, on further use, extremely disagreeable and unwholesome. Hyperides, 
<A NAME="297"></A>we are told, once said to the people, "Do not ask yourselves, men of Athens, 
<A NAME="298"></A>whether or not I am bitter, but whether or not I am paid for being so," 
<A NAME="299"></A>as though a covetous purpose were the only thing that should make a harsh 
<A NAME="300"></A>temper insupportable, and as if men might not even more justly render themselves 
<A NAME="301"></A>obnoxious to popular dislike and censure, by using their power and influence 
<A NAME="302"></A>in the indulgence of their own private passions of pride and jealousy, 
<A NAME="303"></A>anger and animosity. Phocion never allowed himself from any feeling of 
<A NAME="304"></A>personal hostility to do hurt to any fellow-citizen, nor, indeed, reputed 
<A NAME="305"></A>any man his enemy, except so far as he could not but contend sharply with 
<A NAME="306"></A>such as opposed the measures he urged for the public good; in which argument 
<A NAME="307"></A>he was, indeed, a rude, obstinate, and uncompromising adversary. For his 
<A NAME="308"></A>general conversation, it was easy, courteous, and obliging to all, to that 
<A NAME="309"></A>point that he would befriend his very opponents in their distress, and 
<A NAME="310"></A>espouse the cause of those who differed most from him, when they needed 
<A NAME="311"></A>his patronage. His friends reproaching him for pleading in behalf of a 
<A NAME="312"></A>man of indifferent character, he told them the innocent had no need of 
<A NAME="313"></A>an advocate. Aristogiton, the sycophant, whom we mentioned before, having, 
<A NAME="314"></A>after sentence passed upon him, sent earnestly to Phocion to speak with 
<A NAME="315"></A>him in the prison, his friends dissuaded him from going; "Nay, by your 
<A NAME="316"></A>favour," said he, "where should I rather choose to pay Aristogiton a 
<A NAME="317"></A>visit?"
<A NAME="318"></A><BR><BR>As for the allies of the Athenians, and the islanders, whenever 
<A NAME="319"></A>any admiral besides Phocion was sent, they treated him as an enemy suspect, 
<A NAME="320"></A>barricaded their gates, blocked up their havens, brought in from the country 
<A NAME="321"></A>their cattle, slaves, wives, and children, and put them in garrison; but 
<A NAME="322"></A>upon Phocion's arrival, they went out to welcome him in their private boats 
<A NAME="323"></A>and barges, with streamers and garlands, and received him at landing with 
<A NAME="324"></A>every demonstration of joy and pleasure.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR>When King Philip was effecting his entry into Euboea, and was bringing 
<A NAME="326"></A>over troops from Macedonia, and making himself master of the cities, by 
<A NAME="327"></A>means of the tyrants who ruled in them, Plutarch of Eretria sent to request 
<A NAME="328"></A>aid of the Athenians for the relief of the island, which was in imminent 
<A NAME="329"></A>danger of falling wholly into the hands of the Macedonians. Phocion was 
<A NAME="330"></A>sent thither with a handful of men in comparison, in expectation that the 
<A NAME="331"></A>Euboeans themselves would flock in and join him. But when he came, he found 
<A NAME="332"></A>all things in confusion, the country all betrayed, the whole ground, as 
<A NAME="333"></A>it were, undermined under his feet, by the secret pensioners of King Philip, 
<A NAME="334"></A>so that he was in the greatest risk imaginable. To secure himself as far 
<A NAME="335"></A>as he could, he seized a small rising ground, which was divided from the 
<A NAME="336"></A>level plains about Tamynae by a deep watercourse, and here he enclosed 
<A NAME="337"></A>and fortified the choicest of his army. As for the idle talkers and disorderly 
<A NAME="338"></A>bad citizens who ran off from his camp and made their way back, he bade 
<A NAME="339"></A>his officers not regard them, since here they would have been not only 
<A NAME="340"></A>useless and ungovernable themselves, but an actual hindrance to the rest: 
<A NAME="341"></A>and further, being conscious to themselves of the neglect of their duty, 
<A NAME="342"></A>they would be less ready to misrepresent the action, or raise a cry against 
<A NAME="343"></A>them at their return home. When the enemy drew nigh, he bade his men stand 
<A NAME="344"></A>to their arms, until he had finished the sacrifice, in which he spent a 
<A NAME="345"></A>considerable time, either by some difficulty of the thing itself, or on 
<A NAME="346"></A>purpose to invite the enemy nearer. Plutarch, interpreting this tardiness 
<A NAME="347"></A>as a failure in his courage, fell on alone with the mercenaries, which 
<A NAME="348"></A>the cavalry perceiving, could not be contained, but issuing also out of 
<A NAME="349"></A>the camp, confusedly and in disorder, spurred up to the enemy. The first 
<A NAME="350"></A>who came up were defeated, the rest were put to the rout. Plutarch himself 
<A NAME="351"></A>took to flight, and a body of the enemy advanced in the hope of carrying 
<A NAME="352"></A>the camp, supposing themselves to have secured the victory. But by this 
<A NAME="353"></A>time, the sacrifice being over, the Athenians within the camp came forward, 
<A NAME="354"></A>and falling upon them put them to flight, and killed the greater number 
<A NAME="355"></A>as they fled among the intrenchments, while Phocion, ordering his infantry 
<A NAME="356"></A>to keep on the watch and rally those who came in from the previous flight, 
<A NAME="357"></A>himself, with a body of his best men, engaged the enemy in a sharp and 
<A NAME="358"></A>bloody fight, in which all of them behaved with signal courage and gallantry. 
<A NAME="359"></A>Thallus, the son of Cineas, and Glaucus of Polymedes, who fought near the 
<A NAME="360"></A>general, gained the honours of the day. Cleophanes, also, did good service 
<A NAME="361"></A>in the battle. Recovering the cavalry from its defeat, and with his shouts 
<A NAME="362"></A>and encouragement bringing them up to succour the general, who was in danger, 
<A NAME="363"></A>he confirmed the victory obtained by the infantry. Phocion now expelled 
<A NAME="364"></A>Plutarch from Eretria, and possessed himself of the very important fort 
<A NAME="365"></A>of Zaretra, situated where the island is pinched in, as it were, by the 
<A NAME="366"></A>seas on each side, and its breadth most reduced to a narrow girth. He released 
<A NAME="367"></A>all the Greeks whom he took, out of fear of the public speakers at Athens, 
<A NAME="368"></A>thinking they might very likely persuade the people in their anger into 
<A NAME="369"></A>committing some act of cruelty.
<A NAME="370"></A><BR><BR>This affair thus despatched and settled, Phocion set sail homewards, 
<A NAME="371"></A>and the allies had soon as good reason to regret the loss of his just and 
<A NAME="372"></A>humane dealing as the Athenians that of his experience and courage. Molossus, 
<A NAME="373"></A>the commander who took his place, had no better success than to fall alive 
<A NAME="374"></A>into the enemy's hands.
<A NAME="375"></A><BR><BR>Philip, full of great thoughts and designs, now advanced with all 
<A NAME="376"></A>his forces into the Hellespont, to seize the Chersonesus and Perinthus, 
<A NAME="377"></A>and after them Byzantium. The Athenians raised a force to relieve them, 
<A NAME="378"></A>but the popular leaders made it their business to prefer Chares to be general, 
<A NAME="379"></A>who, sailing thither, effected nothing worthy of the means placed in his 
<A NAME="380"></A>hands. The cities were afraid, and would not receive his ships into their 
<A NAME="381"></A>harbours, so that he did nothing but wander about, raising money from their 
<A NAME="382"></A>friends, and despised by their enemies. When the people, chafed by the 
<A NAME="383"></A>orators, were extremely indignant, and repented having ever sent any help 
<A NAME="384"></A>to the Byzantines, Phocion rose and told them they ought not to be angry 
<A NAME="385"></A>with the allies for distrusting, but with their generals for being distrusted. 
<A NAME="386"></A>"They make you suspected," he said, "even by those who cannot possibly 
<A NAME="387"></A>subsist without your succour." The assembly being moved with this speech 
<A NAME="388"></A>of his, changed their minds on the sudden, and commanded him immediately 
<A NAME="389"></A>to raise another force, and go himself to assist their confederates in 
<A NAME="390"></A>the Hellespont; an appointment which, in effect, contributed more than 
<A NAME="391"></A>anything to the relief of Byzantium.
<A NAME="392"></A><BR><BR>For Phocion's name was already honourably known; and an old acquaintance 
<A NAME="393"></A>of his, who had been his fellow-student in the Academy, Leon, a man of 
<A NAME="394"></A>high renown for virtue among the Byzantines, having vouched for Phocion 
<A NAME="395"></A>to the city, they opened their gates to receive him, not permitting him, 
<A NAME="396"></A>though he desired it, to encamp without the walls, but entertained him 
<A NAME="397"></A>and all the Athenians with perfect reliance, while they, to requite their 
<A NAME="398"></A>confidence, behaved among their new hosts soberly and inoffensively, and 
<A NAME="399"></A>exerted themselves on all occasions with the greatest zeal and resolution 
<A NAME="400"></A>for their defence. Thus King Philip was driven out of the Hellespont, and 
<A NAME="401"></A>was despised to boot, whom, till now, it had been thought impossible to 
<A NAME="402"></A>match, or even to oppose. Phocion also took some of his ships, and recaptured 
<A NAME="403"></A>some of the places he had garrisoned, making besides several inroads into 
<A NAME="404"></A>the country, which he plundered and overran, until he received a wound 
<A NAME="405"></A>from some of the enemy who came to the defence, and, thereupon, sailed 
<A NAME="406"></A>away home.
<A NAME="407"></A><BR><BR>The Megarians at this time privately praying aid of the Athenians, 
<A NAME="408"></A>Phocion, fearing lest the Boeotians should hear of it, and anticipate them, 
<A NAME="409"></A>called an assembly at sunrise, and brought forward the petition of the 
<A NAME="410"></A>Megarians, and immediately after the vote had been put, and carried in 
<A NAME="411"></A>their favour, he sounded the trumpet, and led the Athenians straight from 
<A NAME="412"></A>the assembly, to arm and put themselves in posture. The Megarians received 
<A NAME="413"></A>them joyfully, and he proceeded to fortify Nisaea, and built two new long 
<A NAME="414"></A>walls from the city to the arsenal, and so joined it to the sea, so that 
<A NAME="415"></A>having now little reason to regard the enemies on the land side, it placed 
<A NAME="416"></A>its dependence entirely on the Athenians.
<A NAME="417"></A><BR><BR>When final hostilities with Philip were now certain, and in Phocion's 
<A NAME="418"></A>absence other generals had been nominated, he, on his arrival from the 
<A NAME="419"></A>islands, dealt earnestly with the Athenians, that since Philip showed peaceable 
<A NAME="420"></A>inclinations towards them, and greatly apprehended the danger, they would 
<A NAME="421"></A>consent to a treaty. Being contradicted in this by one of the ordinary 
<A NAME="422"></A>frequenters of the courts of justice, a common accuser, who asked him if 
<A NAME="423"></A>he durst presume to persuade the Athenians to peace, now their arms were 
<A NAME="424"></A>in their hands, "Yes," said he, "though I know that if there be war, I 
<A NAME="425"></A>shall be in office over you, and if peace, you over me." But when he could 
<A NAME="426"></A>not prevail, and Demosthenes's opinion carried it, advising them to make 
<A NAME="427"></A>war as far off from home as possible, and fight the battle out of Attica, 
<A NAME="428"></A>"Good friends," said Phocion, "let us not ask where we shall fight, but 
<A NAME="429"></A>how we may conquer in the war. That will be the way to keep it at a distance. 
<A NAME="430"></A>If we are beaten, it will be quickly at our doors." After the defeat, when 
<A NAME="431"></A>the clamourers and incendiaries in the town would have brought up Charidemus 
<A NAME="432"></A>to the hustings, to be nominated to the command, the best of the citizens 
<A NAME="433"></A>were in a panic, and supporting themselves with the aid of the council 
<A NAME="434"></A>of the Areopagus, with entreaties and tears, hardly prevailed upon the 
<A NAME="435"></A>people to have Phocion entrusted with the care of the city. He was of opinion, 
<A NAME="436"></A>in general, that the fair terms to be expected from Philip should be accepted, 
<A NAME="437"></A>yet after Demades had made a motion that the city should receive the common 
<A NAME="438"></A>conditions of peace in concurrence with the rest of the states of Greece, 
<A NAME="439"></A>he opposed it, till it were known what the particulars were which Philip 
<A NAME="440"></A>demanded. He was overborne in this advice, under the pressure of the time, 
<A NAME="441"></A>but almost immediately after the Athenians repented it, when they understood 
<A NAME="442"></A>that by these articles they were obliged to furnish Philip both with horse 
<A NAME="443"></A>and shipping. "It was the fear of this," said Phocion, "that occasioned 
<A NAME="444"></A>my opposition. But since the thing is done, let us make the best of it, 
<A NAME="445"></A>and not be discouraged. Our forefathers were sometimes in command, and 
<A NAME="446"></A>sometimes under it; and by doing their duty, whether as rulers or as subjects, 
<A NAME="447"></A>saved their own country and the rest of Greece."
<A NAME="448"></A><BR><BR>Upon the news of Philip's death, he opposed himself to any public 
<A NAME="449"></A>demonstrations of joy and jubilee, saying it would be ignoble to show malice 
<A NAME="450"></A>upon such an occasion, and that the army that had fought them at Chaeronea 
<A NAME="451"></A>was only diminished by a single man.
<A NAME="452"></A><BR><BR>When Demosthenes made his invectives against Alexander, now on 
<A NAME="453"></A>his way to attack Thebes, he repeated those verses of 
<A NAME="454"></A>Homer:-
<A NAME="455"></A><BR><BR>"Unwise one, wherefore to a second stroke
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>His anger be foolhardy to provoke?"
<A NAME="457"></A><BR><BR>and asked "Why stimulate his already eager passion for glory? Why 
<A NAME="458"></A>take pains to expose the city to the terrible conflagration now so near? 
<A NAME="459"></A>We, who accepted office to save our fellow-citizens, will not, however 
<A NAME="460"></A>they desire it, be consenting to their destruction."
<A NAME="461"></A><BR><BR>After Thebes was lost, and Alexander had demanded Demosthenes, 
<A NAME="462"></A>Lycurgus, Hyperides, and Charidemus to be delivered up, the whole assembly 
<A NAME="463"></A>turning their eyes to him, and calling on him by name to deliver his opinion, 
<A NAME="464"></A>at last he rose up, and showing them one of his most intimate friends, 
<A NAME="465"></A>whom he loved and confided in above all others, told them, "You have brought 
<A NAME="466"></A>things amongst you to that pass, that for my part, should he demand this 
<A NAME="467"></A>my friend Nicocles, I would not refuse to give him up. For as for myself, 
<A NAME="468"></A>to have it in my power to sacrifice my own life and fortune for the common 
<A NAME="469"></A>safety, I should think the greatest of good fortune. Truly," he added, 
<A NAME="470"></A>"it pierces my heart to see those who are fled hither for succour from 
<A NAME="471"></A>the desolation of Thebes. Yet it is enough for Greece to have Thebes to 
<A NAME="472"></A>deplore. It will be more for the interest of all that we should deprecate 
<A NAME="473"></A>the conqueror's anger, and intercede for both, than run the hazard of another 
<A NAME="474"></A>battle."
<A NAME="475"></A><BR><BR>When this was decreed by the people, Alexander is said to have 
<A NAME="476"></A>rejected their first address when it was presented, throwing it from him 
<A NAME="477"></A>scornfully, and turning his back upon the deputation, who left him in affright. 
<A NAME="478"></A>But the second, which was presented by Phocion, he received, understanding 
<A NAME="479"></A>from the older Macedonians how much Philip had admired and esteemed him. 
<A NAME="480"></A>And he not only gave him audience and listened to his memorial and petition, 
<A NAME="481"></A>but also permitted him to advise him, which he did to this effect, that 
<A NAME="482"></A>if his designs were for quietness, he should make peace at once; if glory 
<A NAME="483"></A>were his aim, he should make war, not upon Greece, but on the barbarians. 
<A NAME="484"></A>With various counsels and suggestions, happily designed to meet the genius 
<A NAME="485"></A>and feelings of Alexander, he so won upon him, and softened his temper, 
<A NAME="486"></A>that he bade the Athenians not forget their position, as if anything went 
<A NAME="487"></A>wrong with him, the supremacy belonged to them. And to Phocion himself, 
<A NAME="488"></A>whom he adopted as his friend and guest, he showed a respect, and admitted 
<A NAME="489"></A>him to distinctions, which few of those who were continually near his person 
<A NAME="490"></A>ever received. Duris, at any rate, tells us, that when he became great, 
<A NAME="491"></A>and had conquered Darius, in the heading of all his letters he left off 
<A NAME="492"></A>the word Greeting, except in those he wrote to Phocion. To him, and to 
<A NAME="493"></A>Antipater alone, he condescended to use it. This also is stated by 
<A NAME="494"></A>Chares.
<A NAME="495"></A><BR><BR>As for his munificence to him, it is well known he sent him a present 
<A NAME="496"></A>at one time of one hundred talents; and this being brought to Athens, Phocion 
<A NAME="497"></A>asked of the bearers how it came to pass that among all the Athenians he 
<A NAME="498"></A>alone should be the object of this bounty. Being told that Alexander esteemed 
<A NAME="499"></A>him alone a person of honour and worth, "Let him, then," said he, "permit 
<A NAME="500"></A>me to continue so and be still so reputed." Following him to his house, 
<A NAME="501"></A>and observing his simple and plain way of living, his wife employed in 
<A NAME="502"></A>kneading bread with her own hands, himself drawing water to wash his feet, 
<A NAME="503"></A>they pressed him to accept it, with some indignation, being ashamed, as 
<A NAME="504"></A>they said, that Alexander's friend should live so poorly and pitifully. 
<A NAME="505"></A>So Phocion, pointing out to them a poor old fellow, in a dirty worn-out 
<A NAME="506"></A>coat, passing by, asked them if they thought him in worse condition than 
<A NAME="507"></A>this man. They bade him not mention such a comparison. "Yet," said Phocion, 
<A NAME="508"></A>"he, with less to live upon than I, finds it sufficient, and in brief," 
<A NAME="509"></A>he continued, "if I do not use this money, what good is there in my having 
<A NAME="510"></A>it; and if I do use it, I shall procure an ill name, both for myself and 
<A NAME="511"></A>for Alexander, among my countrymen." So the treasure went back again from 
<A NAME="512"></A>Athens, to prove to Greece, by a signal example, that he who could afford 
<A NAME="513"></A>to give so magnificent a present, was yet not so rich as he who could afford 
<A NAME="514"></A>to refuse it. And when Alexander was displeased, and wrote back to him 
<A NAME="515"></A>to say that he could not esteem those his friends who would not be obliged 
<A NAME="516"></A>by him, not even would this induce Phocion to accept the money, but he 
<A NAME="517"></A>begged leave to intercede with him in behalf of Echecratides, the sophist, 
<A NAME="518"></A>and Athenodorus, the Imbrian, as also for Demaratus and Sparton, two Rhodians, 
<A NAME="519"></A>who had been arrested upon some charges, and were in custody at Sardis. 
<A NAME="520"></A>This was instantly granted by Alexander, and they were set at liberty. 
<A NAME="521"></A>Afterwards, when sending Craterus into Macedonia, he commanded him to make 
<A NAME="522"></A>him an offer of four cities in Asia, Cius, Gergithus, Mylasa, and Elaea, 
<A NAME="523"></A>any one of which, at his choice, should be delivered to him; insisting 
<A NAME="524"></A>yet more positively with him, and declaring he should resent it, should 
<A NAME="525"></A>he continue obstinate in his refusal. But Phocion was not to be prevailed 
<A NAME="526"></A>with at all, and shortly after, Alexander died.
<A NAME="527"></A><BR><BR>Phocion's house is shown to this day in Melita, ornamented with 
<A NAME="528"></A>small plates of copper, but otherwise plain and homely. Concerning his 
<A NAME="529"></A>wives, of the first of them there is little said, except that she was sister 
<A NAME="530"></A>of Cephisodotus, the statuary. The other was a matron of no less reputation 
<A NAME="531"></A>for her virtues and simple living among the Athenians than Phocion was 
<A NAME="532"></A>for his probity. It happened once when the people were entertained with 
<A NAME="533"></A>a new tragedy, that the actor, just as he was to enter the stage to perform 
<A NAME="534"></A>the part of a queen, demanded to have a number of attendants sumptuously 
<A NAME="535"></A>dressed, to follow in his train, and on their not being provided, was sullen 
<A NAME="536"></A>and refused to act, keeping the audience waiting, till at last Melanthius, 
<A NAME="537"></A>who had to furnish the chorus, pushed him on the stage, crying out, "What, 
<A NAME="538"></A>don't you know that Phocion's wife is never attended by more than a single 
<A NAME="539"></A>waiting-woman, but you must needs be grand, and fill our women's heads 
<A NAME="540"></A>with vanity?" This speech of his, spoken loud enough to be heard, was received 
<A NAME="541"></A>with great applause, and clapped all round the theatre. She herself, when 
<A NAME="542"></A>once entertaining a visitor out of Ionia, who showed her all her rich ornaments, 
<A NAME="543"></A>made of gold and set with jewels, her wreaths, necklaces, and the like, 
<A NAME="544"></A>"For my part," said she, "all my ornament is my husband, Phocion, now for 
<A NAME="545"></A>the twentieth year in office as general at Athens."
<A NAME="546"></A><BR><BR>He had a son named Phocus, who wished to take part in the games 
<A NAME="547"></A>at the great feast of Minerva. He permitted him so to do, in the contest 
<A NAME="548"></A>of leaping, not with any view to the victory, but in the hope that the 
<A NAME="549"></A>training and discipline for it would make him a better man, the youth being 
<A NAME="550"></A>in a general way a lover of drinking, and ill-regulated in his habits. 
<A NAME="551"></A>On his having succeeded in the sports, many were eager for the honour of 
<A NAME="552"></A>his company at banquets in celebration of the victory. Phocion declined 
<A NAME="553"></A>all these invitations but one, and when he came to this entertainment and 
<A NAME="554"></A>saw the costly preparations, even the water brought to wash the guests' 
<A NAME="555"></A>feet being mingled with wine and spices, he reprimanded his son, asking 
<A NAME="556"></A>him why he would so far permit his friend to sully the honour of his victory. 
<A NAME="557"></A>And in the hope of wholly weaning the young man from such habits and company, 
<A NAME="558"></A>he sent him to Lacedaemon, and placed him among the youths then under the 
<A NAME="559"></A>course of the Spartan discipline. This the Athenians took offence at, as 
<A NAME="560"></A>though he slighted and contemned the education at home: and Demades twitted 
<A NAME="561"></A>him with it publicly. "Suppose, Phocion, you and I advise the Athenians 
<A NAME="562"></A>to adopt the Spartan constitution. If you like, I am ready to introduce 
<A NAME="563"></A>a bill to that effect, and to speak in its favour." "Indeed," said Phocion, 
<A NAME="564"></A>"you, with that strong scent of perfumes about you, and with that mantle 
<A NAME="565"></A>on your shoulders, are just the very man to speak in honour of Lycurgus, 
<A NAME="566"></A>and recommend the Spartan table."
<A NAME="567"></A><BR><BR>When Alexander wrote to demand a supply of galleys, and the public 
<A NAME="568"></A>speakers objected to sending them, Phocion, on the council requesting his 
<A NAME="569"></A>opinion, told them freely, "Sirs, I would either have you victorious yourselves, 
<A NAME="570"></A>or friends of those who are so." He took up Pytheas, who about this time 
<A NAME="571"></A>first began to address the assembly, and already showed himself a confident, 
<A NAME="572"></A>talking fellow, by saying that a young slave whom the people had but bought 
<A NAME="573"></A>yesterday ought to have the manners to hold his tongue. And when Harpalus, 
<A NAME="574"></A>who had fled from Alexander out of Asia, carrying off a large sum of money, 
<A NAME="575"></A>came to Attica, and there was a perfect race among the ordinary public 
<A NAME="576"></A>men of the assembly who should be the first to take his pay, he distributed 
<A NAME="577"></A>amongst these some trifling sums by way of a bait and provocative, but 
<A NAME="578"></A>to Phocion he made an offer of no less than seven hundred talents and all 
<A NAME="579"></A>manner of other advantages he pleased to demand; with the compliment that 
<A NAME="580"></A>he would entirely commit himself and all his affairs to his disposal. Phocion 
<A NAME="581"></A>answered sharply, Harpalus should repent of it, if he did not quickly leave 
<A NAME="582"></A>off corrupting and debauching the city, which for the time silenced him, 
<A NAME="583"></A>and checked his proceedings. But afterwards, when the Athenians were deliberating 
<A NAME="584"></A>in council about him, he found those that had received money from him to 
<A NAME="585"></A>be his greatest enemies, urging and aggravating matters against him, to 
<A NAME="586"></A>prevent themselves being discovered, whereas Phocion, who had never touched 
<A NAME="587"></A>his pay, now, so far as the public interest would admit of it, showed some 
<A NAME="588"></A>regard to his particular security. This encouraged him once more to try 
<A NAME="589"></A>his inclinations, and upon further survey finding that he himself was a 
<A NAME="590"></A>fortress, inaccessible on every quarter to the approaches of corruption, 
<A NAME="591"></A>he professed a particular friendship to Phocion's son-in-law, Charicles. 
<A NAME="592"></A>And admitting him into his confidence in all his affairs, and continually 
<A NAME="593"></A>requesting his assistance, he brought him under some suspicion. Upon the 
<A NAME="594"></A>occasion, for example, of the death of Pythonice, who was Harpalus's mistress, 
<A NAME="595"></A>for whom he had a great fondness, and had a child by her, he resolved to 
<A NAME="596"></A>build her a sumptuous monument, and committed the care of it to his friend 
<A NAME="597"></A>Charicles. This commission, disreputable enough in itself, was yet further 
<A NAME="598"></A>disparaged by the figure the piece of workmanship made after it was finished. 
<A NAME="599"></A>It is yet to be seen in the Hermenum, as you go from Athens to Eleusis, 
<A NAME="600"></A>with nothing in its appearance answerable to the sum of thirty talents, 
<A NAME="601"></A>with which Charicles is said to have charged Harpalus for its erection. 
<A NAME="602"></A>After Harpalus's own decease, his daughter was educated by Phocion and 
<A NAME="603"></A>Charicles with great care. But when Charicles was called to account for 
<A NAME="604"></A>his dealings with Harpalus, and entreated his father-in-law's protection, 
<A NAME="605"></A>begging that he would appear for him in the court, Phocion refused, telling 
<A NAME="606"></A>him, "I did not choose you for my son-in-law for any but honourable 
<A NAME="607"></A>purposes."
<A NAME="608"></A><BR><BR>Asclepiades, the son of Hipparchus, brought the first tidings of 
<A NAME="609"></A>Alexander's death to Athens, which Demades told them was not to be credited; 
<A NAME="610"></A>for were it true, the whole world would ere this have stunk with the dead 
<A NAME="611"></A>body. But Phocion, seeing the people eager for an instant revolution, did 
<A NAME="612"></A>his best to quiet and repress them. And when numbers of them rushed up 
<A NAME="613"></A>to the hustings to speak, and cried out that the news was true, and Alexander 
<A NAME="614"></A>was dead, "If he is dead to-day," said, "he will be so to-morrow and the 
<A NAME="615"></A>day after to-morrow equally. So that there is no need to take counsel hastily 
<A NAME="616"></A>or before it is safe."
<A NAME="617"></A><BR><BR>When Leosthenes now had embarked the city in the Lamian war, greatly 
<A NAME="618"></A>against Phocion's wishes, to raise a laugh against Phocion, he asked him 
<A NAME="619"></A>scoffingly, what the state had been benefited by his having now so many 
<A NAME="620"></A>years been general. "It is not a little," said Phocion, "that the citizens 
<A NAME="621"></A>have been buried in their own sepulchres." And when Leosthenes continued 
<A NAME="622"></A>to speak boldly and boastfully in the assembly, "Young man," he said, "your 
<A NAME="623"></A>speeches are like cypress-trees, stately and tall, and no fruit to come 
<A NAME="624"></A>of them." When he was then attacked by Hyperides, who asked him when the 
<A NAME="625"></A>time would come that he would advise the Athenians to make war. "As soon," 
<A NAME="626"></A>said he, "as I find the young men keep their ranks, the rich men contribute 
<A NAME="627"></A>their money, and the orators leave off robbing the treasury." Afterwards, 
<A NAME="628"></A>when many admired the forces raised, and the preparations for war that 
<A NAME="629"></A>were made by Leosthenes, they asked Phocion how he approved of the new 
<A NAME="630"></A>levies. "Very well," said he, "for the short course; but what I fear is 
<A NAME="631"></A>the long race. Since, however late the war may last, the city has neither 
<A NAME="632"></A>money, ships, nor soldiers, but these." The event justified his prognostics. 
<A NAME="633"></A>At first all things appeared fair and promising. Leosthenes gained great 
<A NAME="634"></A>reputation by worsting the Boeotians in battle, and driving Antipater within 
<A NAME="635"></A>the walls of Lamia, and the citizens were so transported with the first 
<A NAME="636"></A>successes, that they kept solemn festivities for them, and offered public 
<A NAME="637"></A>sacrifices to the gods. So that some, thinking Phocion must now be convinced 
<A NAME="638"></A>of his error, asked him whether he would not willingly have been author 
<A NAME="639"></A>of these successful actions. "Yes," said he, "most gladly, but also of 
<A NAME="640"></A>the former counsel." And when one express after another came from the camp, 
<A NAME="641"></A>confirming and magnifying the victories, "When," said he, "will the end 
<A NAME="642"></A>of them come?"
<A NAME="643"></A><BR><BR>Leosthenes, soon after, was killed, and now those who feared lest 
<A NAME="644"></A>if Phocion obtained the command he would put an end to the war, arranged 
<A NAME="645"></A>with an obscure person in the assembly, who should stand up and profess 
<A NAME="646"></A>himself to be a friend and old confidant of Phocion's, and persuade the 
<A NAME="647"></A>people to spare him at this time, and reserve him (with whom none could 
<A NAME="648"></A>compare) for a more pressing occasion, and now to give Antiphilus the command 
<A NAME="649"></A>of the army. This pleased the generality, but Phocion made it appear he 
<A NAME="650"></A>was so far from having any friendship with him of old standing, that he 
<A NAME="651"></A>had not so much as the least familiarity with him; "Yet now, sir," says 
<A NAME="652"></A>he, "give me leave to put you down among the number of my friends and well-wishers, 
<A NAME="653"></A>as you have given a piece of advice so much to my advantage."
<A NAME="654"></A><BR><BR>When the people were eager to make an expedition against the Boeotians, 
<A NAME="655"></A>he at first opposed it; and on his friends telling him the people would 
<A NAME="656"></A>kill him for always running counter to them, "That will be unjust of them," 
<A NAME="657"></A>he said, "if I give them honest advice, if not, it will be just of them." 
<A NAME="658"></A>But when he found them persisting and shouting to him to lead them out, 
<A NAME="659"></A>he commanded the crier to make proclamation, that all the Athenians under 
<A NAME="660"></A>sixty should instantly provide themselves with five days' provision, and 
<A NAME="661"></A>follow him from the assembly. This caused a great tumult. Those in years 
<A NAME="662"></A>were startled, and clamoured against the order; he demanded wherein he 
<A NAME="663"></A>injured them, "For I," says he, "am now fourscore, and am ready to lead 
<A NAME="664"></A>you." This succeeded in pacifying them for the present.
<A NAME="665"></A><BR><BR>But when Micion, with a large force of Macedonians and mercenaries, 
<A NAME="666"></A>began to pillage the sea-coast, having made a descent upon Rhamnus, and 
<A NAME="667"></A>overrun the neighbouring country, Phocion led out the Athenians to attack 
<A NAME="668"></A>him. And when sundry private persons came, intermeddling with his dispositions, 
<A NAME="669"></A>and telling him that he ought to occupy such or such a hill, detach the 
<A NAME="670"></A>cavalry in this or that direction, engage the enemy on this point or that, 
<A NAME="671"></A>"Oh Hercules," said he, "how many generals have we here, and how few soldiers!" 
<A NAME="672"></A>Afterwards, having formed the battle, one who wished to show his bravery 
<A NAME="673"></A>advanced out of his post before the rest, but on the enemy's approaching, 
<A NAME="674"></A>lost heart, and retired back into his rank. "Young man," said Phocion, 
<A NAME="675"></A>"are you not ashamed twice in one day to desert your station, first that 
<A NAME="676"></A>on which I had placed you, and secondly that on which you had placed yourself?" 
<A NAME="677"></A>However, he entirely routed the enemy, killing Micion and many more on 
<A NAME="678"></A>the spot. The Grecian army, also, in Thessaly, after Leonnatus and the 
<A NAME="679"></A>Macedonians who came with him out of Asia had arrived and joined Antipater, 
<A NAME="680"></A>fought and beat them in a battle. Leonnatus was killed in the fight, Antiphilus 
<A NAME="681"></A>commanding the foot, and Menon, the Thessalian, the 
<A NAME="682"></A>horse.
<A NAME="683"></A><BR><BR>But not long after, Craterus crossed from Asia with numerous forces; 
<A NAME="684"></A>a pitched battle was fought at Cranon; the Greeks were beaten; though not, 
<A NAME="685"></A>indeed, in a signal defeat, nor with any great loss of men. But what with 
<A NAME="686"></A>their want of obedience to their commanders, who were young and over-indulgent 
<A NAME="687"></A>with them, and what with Antipater's tampering and treating with their 
<A NAME="688"></A>separate cities, one by one, the end of it was that the army was dissolved, 
<A NAME="689"></A>and the Greeks shamefully surrendered the liberty of their 
<A NAME="690"></A>country.
<A NAME="691"></A><BR><BR>Upon the news of Antipater's now advancing at once against Athens, 
<A NAME="692"></A>with all his force, Demosthenes and Hyperides deserted the city, and Demades, 
<A NAME="693"></A>who was altogether insolvent for any part of the fines that had been laid 
<A NAME="694"></A>upon him by the city, for he had been condemned no less than seven times 
<A NAME="695"></A>for introducing bills contrary to the laws, and who had been disfranchised, 
<A NAME="696"></A>and was no longer competent to vote in the assembly, laid hold of this 
<A NAME="697"></A>season of impunity to bring in a bill for sending ambassadors with plenipotentiary 
<A NAME="698"></A>power to Antipater, to treat about a peace. But the people distrusted him, 
<A NAME="699"></A>and called upon Phocion to give his opinion, as the person they only and 
<A NAME="700"></A>entirely confided in. He told them, "If my former counsels had been prevalent 
<A NAME="701"></A>with you, we had not been reduced to deliberate the question at all." However, 
<A NAME="702"></A>the vote passed; and a decree was made, and he with others deputed to go 
<A NAME="703"></A>to Antipater, who lay now encamped in the Theban territories, but intended 
<A NAME="704"></A>to dislodge immediately, and pass into Attica. Phocion's first request 
<A NAME="705"></A>was, that he would make the treaty without moving his camp. And when Craterus 
<A NAME="706"></A>declared that it was not fair to ask them to be burdensome to the country 
<A NAME="707"></A>of their friends and allies by their stay, when they might rather use that 
<A NAME="708"></A>of their enemies for provisions and the support of their army, Antipater, 
<A NAME="709"></A>taking him by the hand, said, "We must grant this favour to Phocion." For 
<A NAME="710"></A>the rest he bade them return to their principals, and acquaint them that 
<A NAME="711"></A>he could only offer them the same terms, namely, to surrender at discretion, 
<A NAME="712"></A>which Leosthenes had offered to him when he was shut up in 
<A NAME="713"></A>Lamia.
<A NAME="714"></A><BR><BR>When Phocion had returned to the city and acquainted them with 
<A NAME="715"></A>this answer, they made a virtue of necessity and complied, since it would 
<A NAME="716"></A>be no better. So Phocion returned to Thebes with the other ambassadors, 
<A NAME="717"></A>and among the rest Xenocrates, the philosopher, the reputation of whose 
<A NAME="718"></A>virtue and wisdom was so great and famous everywhere, that they conceived 
<A NAME="719"></A>there could not be any pride, cruelty, or anger arising in the heart of 
<A NAME="720"></A>man, which would not at the mere sight of him be subdued into something 
<A NAME="721"></A>of reverence and admiration. But the result, as it happened, was the very 
<A NAME="722"></A>opposite, Antipater showed such a want of feeling, and such a dislike of 
<A NAME="723"></A>goodness. He saluted every one else, but would not so much as notice Xenocrates. 
<A NAME="724"></A>Xenocrates, they tell us, observed upon it, that Antipater, when meditating 
<A NAME="725"></A>such cruelty to Athens, did well to be ashamed of seeing him. When he began 
<A NAME="726"></A>to speak, he would not hear him, but broke in and rudely interrupted him, 
<A NAME="727"></A>until at last he was obliged to be silent. But when Phocion had declared 
<A NAME="728"></A>the purport of their embassy, he replied shortly, that he would make peace 
<A NAME="729"></A>with the Athenians on these conditions, and no others; that Demosthenes 
<A NAME="730"></A>and Hyperides should be delivered up to him; that they should retain their 
<A NAME="731"></A>ancient form of government, the franchise being determined by a property 
<A NAME="732"></A>qualification; that they should receive a garrison into Munychia, and pay 
<A NAME="733"></A>a certain sum of the cost of the war. As things stood, these terms were 
<A NAME="734"></A>judged tolerable by the rest of the ambassadors; Xenocrates only said, 
<A NAME="735"></A>that if Antipater considered the Athenians slaves, he was treating them 
<A NAME="736"></A>fairly; but if free, severely. Phocion pressed him only to spare them the 
<A NAME="737"></A>garrison, and used many arguments and entreaties. Antipater replied, "Phocion, 
<A NAME="738"></A>we are ready to do you any favour, which will not bring ruin both on ourselves 
<A NAME="739"></A>and on you." Others report it differently; that Antipater asked Phocion, 
<A NAME="740"></A>supposing he remitted the garrison to the Athenians, would he, Phocion, 
<A NAME="741"></A>stand surety for the city's observing the terms and attempting no revolution? 
<A NAME="742"></A>And when he hesitated, and did not at once reply, Callimedon, the Carabus, 
<A NAME="743"></A>a hot partisan and professed enemy of free states, cried out, "And if he 
<A NAME="744"></A>should talk so idly, Antipater, will you be so much abused as to believe 
<A NAME="745"></A>him and not carry out your own purpose?" So the Athenians received the 
<A NAME="746"></A>garrison, and Menyllus for the governor, a fair-dealing man, and one of 
<A NAME="747"></A>Phocion's acquaintance.
<A NAME="748"></A><BR><BR>But the proceeding seemed sufficiently imperious and arbitrary, 
<A NAME="749"></A>indeed rather a spiteful and insulting ostentation of power, than that 
<A NAME="750"></A>the possession of the fortress would be of any great importance. The resentment 
<A NAME="751"></A>felt upon it was heightened by the time it happened in, for the garrison 
<A NAME="752"></A>was brought in on the twentieth of the month of Boedromion. Just at the 
<A NAME="753"></A>time of the great festival, when they carry forth Iacchus with solemn pomp 
<A NAME="754"></A>from the city to Eleusis; so that the solemnity being disturbed, many began 
<A NAME="755"></A>to call to mind instances, both ancient and modern, of divine interventions 
<A NAME="756"></A>and intimations. For in old time, upon the occasions of their happiest 
<A NAME="757"></A>successes, the presence of the shapes and voices of the mystic ceremonies 
<A NAME="758"></A>had been vouchsafed to them, striking terror and amazement into their enemies; 
<A NAME="759"></A>but now, at the very season of their celebration, the gods themselves stood 
<A NAME="760"></A>witnesses of the saddest oppressions of Greece, the most holy time being 
<A NAME="761"></A>profaned, and their greatest jubilee made the unlucky date of their most 
<A NAME="762"></A>extreme calamity. Not many years before, they had a warning from the oracle 
<A NAME="763"></A>at Dodona, that they should carefully guard the summits of Diana, lest 
<A NAME="764"></A>haply strangers should seize them. And about this very time, when they 
<A NAME="765"></A>dyed the ribbons and garlands with which they adorn the couches and cars 
<A NAME="766"></A>of the procession, instead of a purple, they received only a faint yellow 
<A NAME="767"></A>colour; and to make the omen yet greater, all the things that were dyed 
<A NAME="768"></A>for common use, took the natural colour. While a candidate for initiation 
<A NAME="769"></A>was washing a young pig in the haven of Cantharus, a shark seized him, 
<A NAME="770"></A>bit off his lower parts up to the belly, and devoured them, by which the 
<A NAME="771"></A>god gave them manifestly to understand, that having lost the lower town 
<A NAME="772"></A>and sea-coast, they should keep only the upper city.
<A NAME="773"></A><BR><BR>Menyllus was sufficient security that the garrison should behave 
<A NAME="774"></A>itself inoffensively. But those who were now excluded from the franchise 
<A NAME="775"></A>by property amounted to more than twelve thousand; so that both those that 
<A NAME="776"></A>remained in the city thought themselves oppressed and shamefully used, 
<A NAME="777"></A>and those who on this account left their homes and went away into Thrace, 
<A NAME="778"></A>where Antipater offered them a town and some territory to inhabit, regarded 
<A NAME="779"></A>themselves only as a colony of slaves and exiles. And when to this was 
<A NAME="780"></A>added the deaths of Demosthenes at Calauria, and of Hyperides at Clonae, 
<A NAME="781"></A>as we have elsewhere related, the citizens began to think with regret of 
<A NAME="782"></A>Philip and Alexander, and almost to wish the return of those times. And 
<A NAME="783"></A>as, after Antigonus was slain, when those that had taken him off were afflicting 
<A NAME="784"></A>and oppressing the people, a countryman in Phrygia, digging in the fields, 
<A NAME="785"></A>was asked what he was doing, "I am," said he, fetching a deep sigh, "searching 
<A NAME="786"></A>for Antigonus;" so said many that remembered those days, and the contests 
<A NAME="787"></A>they had with those kings, whose anger, however great, was yet generous 
<A NAME="788"></A>and placable; whereas Antipater, with the counterfeit humility of appearing 
<A NAME="789"></A>like a private man, in the meanness of his dress and his homely fare, merely 
<A NAME="790"></A>belied his real love of that arbitrary power, which he exercised, as a 
<A NAME="791"></A>cruel master and despot, to distress those under his command. Yet Phocion 
<A NAME="792"></A>had interest with him to recall many from banishment by his intercession, 
<A NAME="793"></A>and prevailed also for those who were driven out, that they might not, 
<A NAME="794"></A>like others, be hurried beyond Taenarus, and the mountains of Ceraunia, 
<A NAME="795"></A>but remain in Greece, and plant themselves in Peloponnesus, of which number 
<A NAME="796"></A>was Agnonides, the sycophant. He was no less studious to manage the affairs 
<A NAME="797"></A>within the city with equity and moderation, preferring constantly those 
<A NAME="798"></A>that were men of worth and good education to the magistracies, and recommending 
<A NAME="799"></A>the busy and turbulent talkers, to whom it was a mortal blow to be excluded 
<A NAME="800"></A>from office and public debating, to learn to stay at home, and be content 
<A NAME="801"></A>to till their land. And observing that Xenocrates paid his alien-tax as 
<A NAME="802"></A>a foreigner, he offered him the freedom of the city, which he refused, 
<A NAME="803"></A>saying he could not accept a franchise which he had been sent as an ambassador 
<A NAME="804"></A>to deprecate.
<A NAME="805"></A><BR><BR>Menyllus wished to give Phocion a considerable present of money, 
<A NAME="806"></A>who, thanking him, said, neither was Menyllus greater than Alexander, nor 
<A NAME="807"></A>his own occasions more urgent to receive it now, than when he refused it 
<A NAME="808"></A>from him. And on his pressing him to permit his son Phocus to receive it, 
<A NAME="809"></A>he replied, "If my son returns to a right mind, his patrimony is sufficient; 
<A NAME="810"></A>if not, all supplies will be insufficient." But to Antipater he answered 
<A NAME="811"></A>more sharply, who would have him engaged in something dishonourable. "Antipater," 
<A NAME="812"></A>said he, "cannot have me both as his friend and his flatterer." And, indeed, 
<A NAME="813"></A>Antipater was wont to say he had two friends at Athens, Phocion and Demades; 
<A NAME="814"></A>the one would never suffer him to gratify him at all, the other would never 
<A NAME="815"></A>be satisfied. Phocion might well think that poverty a virtue, in which, 
<A NAME="816"></A>after having so often been general of the Athenians, and admitted to the 
<A NAME="817"></A>friendship of potentates and princes, he had now grown old. Demades, meantime, 
<A NAME="818"></A>delighted in lavishing his wealth even in positive transgressions of the 
<A NAME="819"></A>law. For there having been an order that no foreigner should be hired to 
<A NAME="820"></A>dance in any chorus on the penalty of a fine of one thousand drachmas on 
<A NAME="821"></A>the exhibitor, he had the vanity to exhibit an entire chorus of a hundred 
<A NAME="822"></A>foreigners, and paid down the penalty of a thousand drachmas a head upon 
<A NAME="823"></A>the stage itself. Marrying his son Demeas, he told him with the like vanity, 
<A NAME="824"></A>"My son, when I married your mother, it was done so privately it was not 
<A NAME="825"></A>known to the next neighbours, but kings and princes give presents at your 
<A NAME="826"></A>nuptials."
<A NAME="827"></A><BR><BR>The garrison in Munychia continued to be felt as a great grievance, 
<A NAME="828"></A>and the Athenians did not cease to be importunate upon Phocion, to prevail 
<A NAME="829"></A>with Antipater for its removal; but whether he despaired of effecting it, 
<A NAME="830"></A>or perhaps observed the people to be more orderly, and public matters more 
<A NAME="831"></A>reasonably conducted by the awe that was thus created, he constantly declined 
<A NAME="832"></A>the office, and contented himself with obtaining from Antipater the postponement 
<A NAME="833"></A>for the present of the payment of the sum of money in which the city was 
<A NAME="834"></A>fined. So the people, leaving him off applied themselves to Demades, who 
<A NAME="835"></A>readily undertook the employment, and took along with him his son also 
<A NAME="836"></A>into Macedonia; and some superior power, as it seems, so ordering it, he 
<A NAME="837"></A>came just at that nick of time when Antipater was already seized with his 
<A NAME="838"></A>sickness, and Cassander, taking upon himself the command, had found a letter 
<A NAME="839"></A>of Demades's, formerly written by him to Antigonus in Asia recommending 
<A NAME="840"></A>him to come and possess himself of the empire of Greece and Macedon, now 
<A NAME="841"></A>hanging, he said (a scoff at Antipater), "by an old and rotten thread." 
<A NAME="842"></A>So when Cassander saw him come, he seized him; and first brought out the 
<A NAME="843"></A>son. and killed him so close before his face that the blood ran all over 
<A NAME="844"></A>his clothes and person, and then, after bitterly taunting and upbraiding 
<A NAME="845"></A>him with his ingratitude and treachery, despatched him 
<A NAME="846"></A>himself.
<A NAME="847"></A><BR><BR>Antipater being dead, after nominating Polysperchon general-in-chief 
<A NAME="848"></A>and Cassander commander of the cavalry, Cassander at once set up for himself, 
<A NAME="849"></A>and immediately despatched Nicanor to Menyllus, to succeed him in the command 
<A NAME="850"></A>of the garrison, commanding him to possess himself of Munychia before the 
<A NAME="851"></A>news of Antipater's death should be heard; which being done, and some days 
<A NAME="852"></A>after the Athenians hearing the report of it, Phocion was taxed as privy 
<A NAME="853"></A>to it before, and censured heavily for dissembling it, out of friendship 
<A NAME="854"></A>for Nicanor. But he slighted their talk, and making it his duty to visit 
<A NAME="855"></A>and confer continually with Nicanor, he succeeded in procuring his good-will 
<A NAME="856"></A>and kindness for the Athenians, and induced him even to put himself to 
<A NAME="857"></A>trouble and expense to seek popularity with them, by undertaking the office 
<A NAME="858"></A>of presiding at the games.
<A NAME="859"></A><BR><BR>In the meantime Polysperchon, who was intrusted with the charge 
<A NAME="860"></A>of the king, to countermine Cassander, sent a letter to the city, declaring, 
<A NAME="861"></A>in the name of the king, that he restored them their democracy, and that 
<A NAME="862"></A>the whole Athenian people were at liberty to conduct their commonwealth 
<A NAME="863"></A>according to their ancient customs and constitutions. The object of these 
<A NAME="864"></A>pretences was merely the overthrow of Phocion's influence, as the event 
<A NAME="865"></A>manifested. For Polysperchon's design being to possess himself of the city, 
<A NAME="866"></A>he despaired altogether of bringing it to pass whilst Phocion retained 
<A NAME="867"></A>his credit; and the most certain way to ruin him would be again to fill 
<A NAME="868"></A>the city with a crowd of disfranchised citizens, and let loose the tongues 
<A NAME="869"></A>of the demagogues and common accusers.
<A NAME="870"></A><BR><BR>With this prospect the Athenians were all in excitement, and Nicanor, 
<A NAME="871"></A>wishing to confer with them on the subject, at a meeting of the Council 
<A NAME="872"></A>in Piraeus, came himself, trusting for the safety of his person to Phocion. 
<A NAME="873"></A>And when Dercyllus, who commanded the guard there, made an attempt to seize 
<A NAME="874"></A>him, upon notice of it beforehand, he made his escape, and there was little 
<A NAME="875"></A>doubt he would now lose no time in righting himself upon the city for the 
<A NAME="876"></A>affront; and when Phocion was found fault with for letting him get off 
<A NAME="877"></A>and not securing him, he defended himself by saying that he had no mistrust 
<A NAME="878"></A>of Nicanor, nor the least reason to expect any mischief from him, but should 
<A NAME="879"></A>it prove otherwise, for his part he would have them all know, he would 
<A NAME="880"></A>rather receive than do the wrong. And so far as he spoke for himself alone, 
<A NAME="881"></A>the answer was honourable and high-minded enough, but he who hazards his 
<A NAME="882"></A>country's safety, and that, too, when he is her magistrate and chief commander, 
<A NAME="883"></A>can scarcely be acquitted, I fear, of transgressing a higher and more sacred 
<A NAME="884"></A>obligation of justice, which he owed to his fellow-citizens. For it will 
<A NAME="885"></A>not even do to say that he dreaded the involving the city in war, by seizing 
<A NAME="886"></A>Nicanor, and hoped by professions of confidence and just-dealing to retain 
<A NAME="887"></A>him in the observance of the like; but it was, indeed, his credulity and 
<A NAME="888"></A>confidence in him, and an overweening opinion of his sincerity, that imposed 
<A NAME="889"></A>upon him. So that notwithstanding the sundry intimations he had of his 
<A NAME="890"></A>making, preparations to attack Piraeus, sending soldiers over into Salamis, 
<A NAME="891"></A>and tampering with and endeavouring to corrupt various residents in Piraeus, 
<A NAME="892"></A>he would, notwithstanding all this evidence, never be persuaded to believe 
<A NAME="893"></A>it. And even when Philomedes of Lampra had got a decree passed, that all 
<A NAME="894"></A>the Athenians should stand to their arms, and be ready to follow Phocion 
<A NAME="895"></A>their general, he yet sat still and did nothing, until Nicanor actually 
<A NAME="896"></A>led his troops out from Munychia, and drew trenches about Piraeus; upon 
<A NAME="897"></A>which, when Phocion at last would have let out the Athenians, they cried 
<A NAME="898"></A>out against him, and slighted his orders.
<A NAME="899"></A><BR><BR>Alexander, the son of Polysperchon, was at hand with a considerable 
<A NAME="900"></A>force, and professed to come to give them succour against Nicanor, but 
<A NAME="901"></A>intended nothing less, if possible, than to surprise the city, whilst they 
<A NAME="902"></A>were in tumult and divided among themselves. For all that had previously 
<A NAME="903"></A>been expelled from the city, now coming back with him, made their way into 
<A NAME="904"></A>it, and were joined by a mixed multitude of foreigners and disfranchised 
<A NAME="905"></A>persons, and of these a motley and irregular public assembly came together, 
<A NAME="906"></A>in which they presently divested Phocion of all power, and chose other 
<A NAME="907"></A>generals; and if by chance Alexander had not been spied from the walls, 
<A NAME="908"></A>alone in close conference with Nicanor, and had not this, which was often 
<A NAME="909"></A>repeated, given the Athenians cause of suspicion, the city had not escaped 
<A NAME="910"></A>the snare. The orator Agnonides, however, at once fell foul upon Phocion, 
<A NAME="911"></A>and impeached him of treason; Callimedon and Charicles, fearing the worst, 
<A NAME="912"></A>consulted their own security by flying from the city. Phocion, with a few 
<A NAME="913"></A>of his friends that stayed with him went over to Polysperchon, and out 
<A NAME="914"></A>of respect for him, Solon of Plataea, and Dinarchus of Corinth, who were 
<A NAME="915"></A>reputed friends and confidants of Polysperchon, accompanied him. But on 
<A NAME="916"></A>account of Dinarchus falling ill, they remained several days in Elatea, 
<A NAME="917"></A>during which time, upon the persuasion of Agnonides and on the motion of 
<A NAME="918"></A>Archestratus, a decree passed that the people should send delegates thither 
<A NAME="919"></A>to accuse Phocion. So both parties reached Polysperchon at the same time, 
<A NAME="920"></A>who was going through the country with the king, and was then at a small 
<A NAME="921"></A>village of Phocis, Pharygae, under the mountain now called Galate, but 
<A NAME="922"></A>then Acrurium.
<A NAME="923"></A><BR><BR>There Polysperchon, having set up the golden canopy, and seated 
<A NAME="924"></A>the king and his company under it, ordered Dinarchus at once to be taken, 
<A NAME="925"></A>and tortured, and put to death; and that done, gave audience to the Athenians, 
<A NAME="926"></A>who filled the place with noise and tumult, accusing and recriminating 
<A NAME="927"></A>on one another, till at last Agnonides came forward, and requested they 
<A NAME="928"></A>might all be shut up together in one cage, and conveyed to Athens, there 
<A NAME="929"></A>to decide the controversy. At that the king could not forbear smiling, 
<A NAME="930"></A>but the company that attended, for their own amusement, Macedonians and 
<A NAME="931"></A>strangers, were eager to hear the altercation, and made signs to the delegates 
<A NAME="932"></A>to go on with their case at once. But it was no sort of fair hearing. Polysperchon 
<A NAME="933"></A>frequently interrupted Phocion, till at last Phocion struck his staff on 
<A NAME="934"></A>the ground and declined to speak further. And when Hegemon said, Polysperchon 
<A NAME="935"></A>himself could bear witness to his affection for the people, Polysperchon 
<A NAME="936"></A>called out fiercely, "Give over slandering me to the king," and the king 
<A NAME="937"></A>starting up was about to have run him through with his javelin, but Polysperchon 
<A NAME="938"></A>interposed and hindered him; so that the assembly dissolved.
<A NAME="939"></A><BR><BR>Phocion, then, and those about him, were seized; those of his friends 
<A NAME="940"></A>that were not immediately by him, on seeing this, hid their faces, and 
<A NAME="941"></A>saved themselves by flight. The rest Clitus took and brought to Athens, 
<A NAME="942"></A>to be submitted to trial; but, in truth, as men already sentenced to die. 
<A NAME="943"></A>The manner of conveying them was indeed extremely moving; they were carried 
<A NAME="944"></A>in chariots through the Ceramicus, straight to the place of judicature, 
<A NAME="945"></A>where Clitus secured them till they had convoked an assembly of the people, 
<A NAME="946"></A>which was open to all comers, neither foreigners, nor slaves, nor those 
<A NAME="947"></A>who had been punished with disfranchisement being refused admittance, but 
<A NAME="948"></A>all alike, both men and women, being allowed to come into the court, and 
<A NAME="949"></A>even upon the place of speaking. So having read the king's letters, in 
<A NAME="950"></A>which he declared he was satisfied himself that these men were traitors, 
<A NAME="951"></A>however, they being a free city, he willingly accorded them the grace of 
<A NAME="952"></A>trying and judging them according to their own laws, Clitus brought in 
<A NAME="953"></A>his prisoners. Every respectable citizen, at the sight of Phocion, covered 
<A NAME="954"></A>up his face, and stooped down to conceal his tears. And one of them had 
<A NAME="955"></A>the courage to say, that since the king had committed so important a cause 
<A NAME="956"></A>to the judgment of the people, it would be well that the strangers, and 
<A NAME="957"></A>those of servile condition, should withdraw. But the populace would not 
<A NAME="958"></A>endure it, crying out they were oligarchs, and enemies to the liberty of 
<A NAME="959"></A>the people, and deserved to be stoned; after which no man durst offer anything 
<A NAME="960"></A>further in Phocion's behalf. He was himself with difficulty heard at all, 
<A NAME="961"></A>when he put the question, "Do you wish to put us to death lawfully or unlawfully?" 
<A NAME="962"></A>Some answered, "According to law." He replied, "How can you, except we 
<A NAME="963"></A>have a fair hearing?" But when they were deaf to all he said, approaching 
<A NAME="964"></A>nearer, "As to myself," said he, "I admit my guilt, and pronounce my public 
<A NAME="965"></A>conduct to have deserved sentence of death. But why, O men of Athens, kill 
<A NAME="966"></A>others who have offended in nothing?" The rabble cried out they were his 
<A NAME="967"></A>friends, that was enough. Phocion therefore drew back, and said no 
<A NAME="968"></A>more.
<A NAME="969"></A><BR><BR>Then Agnonides read the bill, in accordance with which the people 
<A NAME="970"></A>should decide by show of hands whether they judged them guilty, and if 
<A NAME="971"></A>so it should be found, the penalty should be death. When this had been 
<A NAME="972"></A>read out, some desired it might be added to the sentence that Phocion should 
<A NAME="973"></A>be tortured also, and the rack should be produced with the executioners. 
<A NAME="974"></A>But Agnonides perceiving even Clitus to dislike this, and himself thinking 
<A NAME="975"></A>it horrid and barbarous, said, "When we catch that slave, Callimedon, men 
<A NAME="976"></A>of Athens, we will put him to the rack, but I shall make no motion of the 
<A NAME="977"></A>kind in Phocion's case." Upon which one of the better citizens remarked, 
<A NAME="978"></A>he was quite right; "If he should torture Phocion, what could we do to 
<A NAME="979"></A>you?" So the form of the bill was approved of, and the show of hands called 
<A NAME="980"></A>for; upon which, not one man retaining his seat, but all rising up, and 
<A NAME="981"></A>some with garlands on their heads, they condemned them all to 
<A NAME="982"></A>death.
<A NAME="983"></A><BR><BR>There were present with Phocion, Nicocles, Thudippus, Hegemon, 
<A NAME="984"></A>and Pythocles. Demetrius the Phalerian, Callimedon, Charicles, and some 
<A NAME="985"></A>others, were included in the condemnation, being absent.
<A NAME="986"></A><BR><BR>After the assembly was dismissed, they were carried to the prison; 
<A NAME="987"></A>the rest with cries and lamentations, their friends and relatives following 
<A NAME="988"></A>and clinging about them, but Phocion looking (as men observed with astonishment 
<A NAME="989"></A>at his calmness and magnanimity), just the same as when he had been used 
<A NAME="990"></A>to return to his home attended, as general, from the assembly. His enemies 
<A NAME="991"></A>ran along by his side, reviling and abusing him. And one of them coming 
<A NAME="992"></A>up to him, spat in his face; at which Phocion, turning to the officers, 
<A NAME="993"></A>only said, "You should stop this indecency." Thudippus, on their reaching 
<A NAME="994"></A>the prison, when he observed the executioner tempering the poison and preparing 
<A NAME="995"></A>it for them, gave away to his passion, and began to bemoan his condition 
<A NAME="996"></A>and the hard measure he received, thus unjustly to suffer with Phocion. 
<A NAME="997"></A>"You cannot be contented," said he, "to die with Phocion?" One of his friends 
<A NAME="998"></A>that stood by, asked him if he wished to have anything said to his son. 
<A NAME="999"></A>"Yes, by all means," said he, "bid him bear no grudge against the Athenians." 
<A NAME="1000"></A>Then Nicocles, the dearest and most faithful of his friends, begged to 
<A NAME="1001"></A>be allowed to drink the poison first. "My friend," said he, "you ask what 
<A NAME="1002"></A>I am loath and sorrowful to give, but as I never yet in all my life was 
<A NAME="1003"></A>so thankless as to refuse you, I must gratify you in this also." After 
<A NAME="1004"></A>they had all drunk of it, the poison ran short; and the executioner refused 
<A NAME="1005"></A>to prepare more, except they would pay him twelve drachmas, to defray the 
<A NAME="1006"></A>cost of the quantity required. Some delay was made, and time spent, when 
<A NAME="1007"></A>Phocion called one of his friends, and observing that a man could not even 
<A NAME="1008"></A>die at Athens without paying for it, requested him to give the 
<A NAME="1009"></A>sum.
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR><BR>It was the nineteenth day of the month Munychion, on which it was 
<A NAME="1011"></A>the usage to have a solemn procession in the city, in honour of Jupiter. 
<A NAME="1012"></A>The horsemen, as they passed by, some of them threw away their garlands, 
<A NAME="1013"></A>others stopped, weeping, and casting sorrowful looks towards the prison 
<A NAME="1014"></A>doors, and all the citizens whose minds were not absolutely debauched by 
<A NAME="1015"></A>spite and passion, or who had any humanity left, acknowledged it to have 
<A NAME="1016"></A>been most impiously done, not, at least, to let that day pass, and the 
<A NAME="1017"></A>city so be kept pure from death and a public execution at the solemn festival. 
<A NAME="1018"></A>But as if this triumph had been insufficient, the malice of Phocion's enemies 
<A NAME="1019"></A>went yet further; his dead body was excluded from burial within the boundaries 
<A NAME="1020"></A>of the country, and none of the Athenians could light a funeral pile to 
<A NAME="1021"></A>burn the corpse; neither durst any of his friends venture to concern themselves 
<A NAME="1022"></A>about it. A certain Conopion, a man who used to do these offices for hire, 
<A NAME="1023"></A>took the body and carried it beyond Eleusis, and procuring fire from over 
<A NAME="1024"></A>the frontier of Megara, burned it. Phocion's wife, with her servant-maids, 
<A NAME="1025"></A>being present and assisting at the solemnity, raised there an empty tomb, 
<A NAME="1026"></A>and performed the customary libations, and gathering up the bones in her 
<A NAME="1027"></A>lap, and bringing them home by night, dug a place for them by the fireside 
<A NAME="1028"></A>in her house, saying, "Blessed hearth, to your custody I commit the remains 
<A NAME="1029"></A>of a good and brave man, and, I beseech you, protect and restore them to 
<A NAME="1030"></A>the sepulchre of his fathers, when the Athenians return to their right 
<A NAME="1031"></A>minds."
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR><BR>And, indeed, a very little time and their own sad experience soon 
<A NAME="1033"></A>informed them what an excellent governor, and how great an example and 
<A NAME="1034"></A>guardian of justice and of temperance they had bereft themselves of. And 
<A NAME="1035"></A>now they decreed him a statue of brass, and his bones to be buried honourably 
<A NAME="1036"></A>at the public charge; and for his accusers, Agnonides they took themselves, 
<A NAME="1037"></A>and caused him to be put to death. Epicurus and Demophilus, who fled from 
<A NAME="1038"></A>the city for fear, his son met with, and took his revenge upon them. This 
<A NAME="1039"></A>son of his, we are told, was in general of an indifferent character, and 
<A NAME="1040"></A>once when enamoured of a slave girl kept by a common harlot merchant, happened 
<A NAME="1041"></A>to hear Theodorus, the atheist, arguing in the Lyceum, that if it were 
<A NAME="1042"></A>a good and honourable thing to buy the freedom of a friend in the masculine, 
<A NAME="1043"></A>why not also of a friend in the feminine, if, for example, a master, why 
<A NAME="1044"></A>not also a mistress? So putting the good argument and his passion together, 
<A NAME="1045"></A>he went off and purchased the girl's freedom. The death which was thus 
<A NAME="1046"></A>suffered by Phocion revived among the Greeks the memory of that of Socrates, 
<A NAME="1047"></A>the two cases being so similar, and both equally the sad fault and misfortune 
<A NAME="1048"></A>of the city.
