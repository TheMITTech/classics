<BR>(legendary, lived legendary, 8th century B.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>From whom, and for what reason, the city of Rome, a name so great in glory, 
<A NAME="11"></A>and famous in the mouths of all men, was so first called, authors do not 
<A NAME="12"></A>agree. Some are of opinion that the Pelasgians, wandering over the greater 
<A NAME="13"></A>part of the habitable world, and subduing numerous nations, fixed themselves 
<A NAME="14"></A>here, and, from their own great strength in war, called the city Rome. 
<A NAME="15"></A>Others, that at the taking of Troy, some few that escaped and met with 
<A NAME="16"></A>shipping, put to sea, and driven by winds, were carried upon the coasts 
<A NAME="17"></A>of Tuscany, and came to anchor off the mouth of the river Tiber, where 
<A NAME="18"></A>their women, out of heart and weary with the sea, on its being proposed 
<A NAME="19"></A>by one of the highest birth and best understanding amongst them, whose 
<A NAME="20"></A>name was Roma, burnt the ships. With which act the men at first were angry, 
<A NAME="21"></A>but afterwards, of necessity, seating themselves near Palatium, where things 
<A NAME="22"></A>in a short while succeeded far better than they could hope, in that they 
<A NAME="23"></A>found the country very good, and the people courteous, they not only did 
<A NAME="24"></A>the lady Roma other honours, but added also this, of calling after her 
<A NAME="25"></A>name the city which she had been the occasion of their founding. From this, 
<A NAME="26"></A>they say, has come down that custom at Rome for women to salute their kinsmen 
<A NAME="27"></A>and husbands with kisses; because these women, after they had burnt the 
<A NAME="28"></A>ships, made use of such endearments when entreating and pacifying their 
<A NAME="29"></A>husbands.
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>Some again say that Roma, from whom this city was so called, was 
<A NAME="31"></A>daughter of Italus and Leucaria; or, by another account, of Telaphus, Hercules's 
<A NAME="32"></A>son, and that she was married to Aeneas, or, according to others again, 
<A NAME="33"></A>to Ascanius, Aeneas's son. Some tell us that Romanus, the son of Ulysses 
<A NAME="34"></A>and Circe, built it; some, Romus, the son of Emathion, Diomede having sent 
<A NAME="35"></A>him from Troy; and others, Romus, king of the Latins, after driving out 
<A NAME="36"></A>the Tyrrhenians, who had come from Thessaly into Lydia, and from thence 
<A NAME="37"></A>into Italy. Those very authors, too, who, in accordance with the safest 
<A NAME="38"></A>account, make Romulus give the name of the city, yet differ concerning 
<A NAME="39"></A>his birth and family. For some say, he was son to Aeneas and Dexithea, 
<A NAME="40"></A>daughter of Phorbas, and was, with his brother Remus, in their infancy, 
<A NAME="41"></A>carried into Italy, and being on the river when the waters came down in 
<A NAME="42"></A>a flood, all the vessels were cast away except only that where the young 
<A NAME="43"></A>children were, which being gently landed on a level bank of the river, 
<A NAME="44"></A>they were both unexpectedly saved, and from them the place was called Rome. 
<A NAME="45"></A>Some say, Roma, daughter of the Trojan lady above mentioned, was married 
<A NAME="46"></A>to Latinus, Telemachus's son, and became mother to Romulus; others that 
<A NAME="47"></A>Aemilia, daughter of Aeneas and Lavinia, had him by the god Mars; and others 
<A NAME="48"></A>give you mere fables of his origin. For to Tarchetius, they say, king of 
<A NAME="49"></A>Alba, who was a most wicked and cruel man, there appeared in his own house 
<A NAME="50"></A>a strange vision, a male figure that rose out of a hearth, and stayed there 
<A NAME="51"></A>for many days. There was an oracle of Tethys in Tuscany which Tarchetius 
<A NAME="52"></A>consulted, and received an answer that a virgin should give herself to 
<A NAME="53"></A>the apparition, and that a son should be born of her, highly renowned, 
<A NAME="54"></A>eminent for valour, good fortune, and strength of body. Tarchetius told 
<A NAME="55"></A>the prophecy to one of his own daughters, and commanded her to do this 
<A NAME="56"></A>thing; which she avoiding as an indignity, sent her handmaid. Tarchetius, 
<A NAME="57"></A>hearing this, in great anger imprisoned them both, purposing to put them 
<A NAME="58"></A>to death, but being deterred from murder by the goddess Vesta in a dream, 
<A NAME="59"></A>enjoined them for their punishment the working a web of cloth, in their 
<A NAME="60"></A>chains as they were, which when they finished, they should be suffered 
<A NAME="61"></A>to marry; but whatever they worked by day, Tarchetius commanded others 
<A NAME="62"></A>to unravel in the night.
<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR>In the meantime, the waiting-woman was delivered of two boys, whom 
<A NAME="64"></A>Tarchetius gave into the hands of one Teratius, with command to destroy 
<A NAME="65"></A>them; he, however, carried and laid them by the river side, where a wolf 
<A NAME="66"></A>came and continued to suckle them, while birds of various sorts brought 
<A NAME="67"></A>little morsels of food, which they put into their mouths; till a cowherd, 
<A NAME="68"></A>spying them, was first strangely surprised, but, venturing to draw nearer, 
<A NAME="69"></A>took the children up in his arms. Thus they were saved, and when they grew 
<A NAME="70"></A>up, set upon Tarchetius and overcame him. This one Promathion says, who 
<A NAME="71"></A>compiled a history of Italy.
<A NAME="72"></A><BR><BR>But the story which is most believed and has the greatest number 
<A NAME="73"></A>of vouchers was first published, in its chief particulars, amongst the 
<A NAME="74"></A>Greeks by Diocles of Peparethus, whom Fabius Pictor also follows in most 
<A NAME="75"></A>points. Here again there are variations, but in general outline it runs 
<A NAME="76"></A>thus: the kings of Alba reigned in lineal descent from Aeneas, and the 
<A NAME="77"></A>succession devolved at length upon two brothers, Numitor and Amulius. Amulius 
<A NAME="78"></A>proposed to divide things into two equal shares, and set as equivalent 
<A NAME="79"></A>to the kingdom the treasure and gold that were brought from Troy. Numitor 
<A NAME="80"></A>chose the kingdom; but Amulius, having the money, and being able to do 
<A NAME="81"></A>more with that than Numitor, took his kingdom from him with great ease, 
<A NAME="82"></A>and, fearing lest his daughter might have children, made her a Vestal, 
<A NAME="83"></A>bound in that condition forever to live a single and maiden life. This 
<A NAME="84"></A>lady some call Ilia, others Rhea, and others Silvia; however, not long 
<A NAME="85"></A>after, she was, contrary to the established laws of the Vestals, discovered 
<A NAME="86"></A>to be with child, and should have suffered the most cruel punishment, had 
<A NAME="87"></A>not Antho, the king's daughter, mediated with her father for her; nevertheless, 
<A NAME="88"></A>she was confined, and debarred all company, that she might not be delivered 
<A NAME="89"></A>without the king's knowledge. In time she brought forth two boys, of more 
<A NAME="90"></A>than human size and beauty, whom Amulius, becoming yet more alarmed, commanded 
<A NAME="91"></A>a servant to take and cast away; this man some call Faustulus, others say 
<A NAME="92"></A>Faustulus was the man who brought them up. He put the children, however, 
<A NAME="93"></A>in a small trough, and. went towards the river with a design to cast them 
<A NAME="94"></A>in; but, seeing the waters much swollen and coming violently down, was 
<A NAME="95"></A>afraid to go nearer, and dropping the children near the bank, went away. 
<A NAME="96"></A>The river overflowing, the flood at last bore up the trough, and, gently 
<A NAME="97"></A>wafting it, landed them on a smooth piece of ground, which they now called 
<A NAME="98"></A>Cermanus, formerly Germanus, perhaps from Germani with signifies 
<A NAME="99"></A>brothers.
<A NAME="100"></A><BR><BR>Near this place grew a wild fig-tree, which they called Ruminalis, 
<A NAME="101"></A>either from Romulus (as it is vulgarly thought), or from ruminating, because 
<A NAME="102"></A>cattle did usually in the heat of the day seek cover under it, and there 
<A NAME="103"></A>chew the cud; or, better, from the suckling of these children there, for 
<A NAME="104"></A>the ancients called the dug or teat of any creature ruma; and there is 
<A NAME="105"></A>a tutelar goddess of the rearing of children whom they still call Rumilia, 
<A NAME="106"></A>in sacrificing to whom they use no wine, but make libations of milk. While 
<A NAME="107"></A>the infants lay here, history tells us, a she-wolf nursed them, and a woodpecker 
<A NAME="108"></A>constantly fed and watched them; these creatures are esteemed holy to the 
<A NAME="109"></A>god Mars; the woodpecker the Latins still especially worship and honour. 
<A NAME="110"></A>Which things, as much as any, gave credit to what the mother of the children 
<A NAME="111"></A>said, that their father was the god Mars; though some say that it was a 
<A NAME="112"></A>mistake put upon her by Amulius, who himself had come to her dressed up 
<A NAME="113"></A>in armour.
<A NAME="114"></A><BR><BR>Others think that the first rise of this fable came from the children's 
<A NAME="115"></A>nurse, through the ambiguity of her name; for the Latins not only called 
<A NAME="116"></A>wolves lupoe, but also women of loose life; and such an one was the wife 
<A NAME="117"></A>of Faustulus, who nurtured these children, Acca Larentia by name. To her 
<A NAME="118"></A>the Romans offer sacrifices, and in the month of April the priest of Mars 
<A NAME="119"></A>makes libations there; it is called the Larentian Feast. They honour also 
<A NAME="120"></A>another Larentia, for the following reason: the keeper of Hercules's temple 
<A NAME="121"></A>having, it seems, little else to do, proposed to his deity a game at dice, 
<A NAME="122"></A>laying down that, if he himself won, he would have something valuable of 
<A NAME="123"></A>the god; but if he were beaten, he would spread him a noble table, and 
<A NAME="124"></A>procure him a fair lady's company. Upon these terms, throwing first for 
<A NAME="125"></A>the god and then for himself, he found himself beaten. Wishing to pay his 
<A NAME="126"></A>stakes honourably, and holding himself bound by what he had said, he both 
<A NAME="127"></A>provided the diety a good supper, and giving money to Larentia, then in 
<A NAME="128"></A>her beauty, though not publicly known, gave her a feast in the temple, 
<A NAME="129"></A>where he had also laid a bed, and after supper locked her in, as if the 
<A NAME="130"></A>god were really to come to her. And indeed, it is said, the deity did truly 
<A NAME="131"></A>visit her, and commanded her in the morning to walk to the marketplace, 
<A NAME="132"></A>and, whatever man she met first, to salute him, and make him her friend. 
<A NAME="133"></A>She met one named Tarrutius, who was a man advanced in years, fairly rich, 
<A NAME="134"></A>without children, and had always lived a single life. He received Larentia, 
<A NAME="135"></A>and loved her well, and at his death left her sole heir of all his large 
<A NAME="136"></A>and fair possessions, most of which she, in her last will and testament, 
<A NAME="137"></A>bequeathed to the people. It was reported of her, being now celebrated 
<A NAME="138"></A>and esteemed the mistress of a god, that she suddenly disappeared near 
<A NAME="139"></A>the place where the first Larentia lay buried; the spot is at this day 
<A NAME="140"></A>called Velabrum, because, the river frequently overflowing, they went over 
<A NAME="141"></A>in ferry-boats somewhere hereabouts to the forum, the Latin word for ferrying 
<A NAME="142"></A>being velatura. Others derive the name from velum, a sail; because the 
<A NAME="143"></A>exhibitors of public shows used to hang the road that leads from the forum 
<A NAME="144"></A>to the Circus Maximus with sails, beginning at this spot. Upon these accounts 
<A NAME="145"></A>the second Larentia is honoured at Rome.
<A NAME="146"></A><BR><BR>Meantime Faustulus, Amulius's swineherd, brought up the children 
<A NAME="147"></A>without any man's knowledge; or, as those say who wish to keep closer to 
<A NAME="148"></A>probabilities, with the knowledge and secret assistance of Numitor; for 
<A NAME="149"></A>it is said, they went to school at Gabii, and were well instructed in letters, 
<A NAME="150"></A>and other accomplishments befitting their birth. And they were called Romulus 
<A NAME="151"></A>and Remus (from ruma, the dug), as we had before, because they were found 
<A NAME="152"></A>sucking the wolf. In their very infancy, the size and beauty of their bodies 
<A NAME="153"></A>intimated their natural superiority; and when they grew up, they both proved 
<A NAME="154"></A>brave and manly, attempting all enterprises that seemed hazardous, and 
<A NAME="155"></A>showing in them a courage altogether undaunted. But Romulus seemed rather 
<A NAME="156"></A>to act by counsel, and to show the sagacity of a statesman, and in all 
<A NAME="157"></A>his dealings with their neighbours, whether relating to feeding of flocks 
<A NAME="158"></A>or to hunting, gave the idea of being born rather to rule than to obey. 
<A NAME="159"></A>To their comrades and inferiors they were therefore dear; but the king's 
<A NAME="160"></A>servants, his bailiffs and overseers, as being in nothing better than themselves, 
<A NAME="161"></A>they despised and slighted, nor were the least concerned at their commands 
<A NAME="162"></A>and menaces. They used honest pastimes and liberal studies, not esteeming 
<A NAME="163"></A>sloth and idleness honest and liberal, but rather such exercises as hunting 
<A NAME="164"></A>and running, repelling robbers, taking of thieves, and delivering the wronged 
<A NAME="165"></A>and oppressed from injury. For doing such things they became 
<A NAME="166"></A>famous.
<A NAME="167"></A><BR><BR>A quarrel occurring betwixt Numitor's and Amulius's cowherds, the 
<A NAME="168"></A>latter, not enduring the driving away of their cattle by the others, fell 
<A NAME="169"></A>upon them and put them to flight, and rescued the greatest part of the 
<A NAME="170"></A>prey. At which Numitor being highly incensed, they little regarded it, 
<A NAME="171"></A>but collected and took into their company a number of needy men and runaway 
<A NAME="172"></A>slaves,- acts which looked like the first stages of rebellion. It so happened 
<A NAME="173"></A>that when Romulus was attending a sacrifice, being fond of sacred rites 
<A NAME="174"></A>and divination, Numitor's herdsmen, meeting with Remus on a journey with 
<A NAME="175"></A>few companions, fell upon him, and after some fighting, took him prisoner, 
<A NAME="176"></A>carried him before Numitor, and there accused him. Numitor would not punish 
<A NAME="177"></A>him himself, fearing his brother's anger, but went to Amulius, and desired 
<A NAME="178"></A>justice, as he was Amulius's brother and was affronted by Amulius's servants. 
<A NAME="179"></A>The men of Alba likewise resenting the thing, and thinking he had been 
<A NAME="180"></A>dishonourably used, Amulius was induced to deliver Remus up into Numitor's 
<A NAME="181"></A>hands, to use him as he thought fit. He therefore took and carried him 
<A NAME="182"></A>home, and, being struck with admiration of the youth's person, in stature 
<A NAME="183"></A>aid strength of body exceeding all men, and perceiving in his very countenance 
<A NAME="184"></A>the courage and force of his mind, which stood unsubdued and unmoved by 
<A NAME="185"></A>his present circumstances, and hearing further that all the enterprises 
<A NAME="186"></A>and actions of his life were answerable to what he saw of but chiefly, 
<A NAME="187"></A>as it seemed, a divine influence aiding and directing the first steps that 
<A NAME="188"></A>were to lead to great results, out of the mere thought of his mind and 
<A NAME="189"></A>casually, as it were, he put his hand upon the fact, and, in gentle terms 
<A NAME="190"></A>and with a kind aspect, to inspire him with confidence and hope, asked 
<A NAME="191"></A>him who he was, and whence he was derived. He, taking heart, spoke thus: 
<A NAME="192"></A>"I will hide nothing from you, for you seem to be of a more princely temper 
<A NAME="193"></A>than Amulius, in that you give a hearing and examine before you punish, 
<A NAME="194"></A>while he condemns before the cause is heard. Formerly, then, we (for we 
<A NAME="195"></A>are twins) thought ourselves the sons of Faustulus and Larentia, the king's 
<A NAME="196"></A>servants; but since we have been accused and aspersed with calumnies, and 
<A NAME="197"></A>brought in peril of our lives here before you, we hear great things of 
<A NAME="198"></A>ourselves, the truth of which my present danger is likely to bring to the 
<A NAME="199"></A>test. Our birth is said to have been secret, our fostering and nurture 
<A NAME="200"></A>in our infancy still more strange; by birds and beasts, to whom we were 
<A NAME="201"></A>cast out, we were fed, by the milk of a wolf and the morsels of a woodpecker, 
<A NAME="202"></A>as we lay in a little trough by the side of the river. The trough is still 
<A NAME="203"></A>in being, and is preserved, with brass plates round it, and an inscription 
<A NAME="204"></A>in letters almost effaced, which may prove hereafter unavailing tokens 
<A NAME="205"></A>to our parents when we are dead and gone." Numitor, upon these words, and 
<A NAME="206"></A>computing the dates by the young man's looks, slighted not the hope that 
<A NAME="207"></A>flattered him, but considered how to come at his daughter privately (for 
<A NAME="208"></A>she was still kept under restraint), to talk with her concerning these 
<A NAME="209"></A>matters.
<A NAME="210"></A><BR><BR>Faustulus, hearing Remus was taken and delivered up, called on 
<A NAME="211"></A>Romulus to assist in his rescue, informing him then plainly of the particulars 
<A NAME="212"></A>of his birth, not but he had before given hints of it, and told as much 
<A NAME="213"></A>as an attentive man might make no small conclusions from; he himself, full 
<A NAME="214"></A>of concern and fear of not coming in time, took the trough, and ran instantly 
<A NAME="215"></A>to Numitor; but giving a suspicion to some of the king's sentries at his 
<A NAME="216"></A>gate, and being gazed upon by them and perplexed with their questions, 
<A NAME="217"></A>he let it be seen that he was hiding the trough under his cloak. By chance 
<A NAME="218"></A>there was one among them who was at the exposing of the children, and was 
<A NAME="219"></A>employed in the office; he, seeing the trough and knowing it by its make 
<A NAME="220"></A>and inscription, guessed at the business, and, without further delay, telling 
<A NAME="221"></A>the king of it, brought in the man to be examined. Faustulus, hard beset, 
<A NAME="222"></A>did not show himself altogether proof against terror; nor yet was he wholly 
<A NAME="223"></A>forced out of all; confessed indeed the children were alive, but lived, 
<A NAME="224"></A>he said, as shepherds, a great way from Alba; he himself was going to carry 
<A NAME="225"></A>the trough to Ilia, who had often greatly desired to see and handle it, 
<A NAME="226"></A>for a confirmation of her hopes of her children. As men generally do who 
<A NAME="227"></A>are troubled in mind and act either in fear or passion, it so fell out 
<A NAME="228"></A>Amulius now did; for he sent in haste as a messenger, a man, otherwise 
<A NAME="229"></A>honest, and friendly to Numitor, with commands to learn from Numitor whether 
<A NAME="230"></A>any tidings were come to him of the children being alive. He, coming and 
<A NAME="231"></A>seeing how little Remus wanted of being received into the arms and embraces 
<A NAME="232"></A>of Numitor, both gave him surer confidence in his hope, and advised them, 
<A NAME="233"></A>with all expedition, to proceed to action; himself too joining and assisting 
<A NAME="234"></A>them, and indeed, had they wished it, the time would not have let them 
<A NAME="235"></A>demur. For Romulus was now come very near, and many of the citizens, out 
<A NAME="236"></A>of fear and hatred of Amulius, were running out to join him; besides, he 
<A NAME="237"></A>brought great forces with him, divided into companies each of an hundred 
<A NAME="238"></A>men, every captain carrying a small bundle of grass and shrubs tied to 
<A NAME="239"></A>a pole. The Latins call such bundles manipuli, and from hence it is that 
<A NAME="240"></A>in their armies they still call their captains manipulares. Remus rousing 
<A NAME="241"></A>the citizens within to revolt, and Romulus making attacks from without, 
<A NAME="242"></A>the tyrant, not knowing either what to do, or what expedient to think of 
<A NAME="243"></A>for his security, in this perplexity and confusion was taken and put to 
<A NAME="244"></A>death. This narrative for the most part given by Fabius and Diocles of 
<A NAME="245"></A>Peparethus, who seem to be the earliest historians of the foundation of 
<A NAME="246"></A>Rome, is suspected by some, because of its dramatic and fictitious appearance; 
<A NAME="247"></A>but it would not wholly be disbelieved, if men would remember what a poet 
<A NAME="248"></A>fortune sometimes shows herself, and consider that the Roman power would 
<A NAME="249"></A>hardly have reached so high a pitch without a divinely ordered origin, 
<A NAME="250"></A>attended with great and extraordinary circumstances.
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR>Amulius now being dead and matters quietly disposed, the two brothers 
<A NAME="252"></A>would neither dwell in Alba without governing there, nor take the government 
<A NAME="253"></A>into their own hands during the life of their grandfather. Having therefore 
<A NAME="254"></A>delivered the dominion up into his hands, and paid their mother befitting 
<A NAME="255"></A>honour, they resolved to live by themselves, and build a city in the same 
<A NAME="256"></A>place where they were in their infancy brought up. This seems the most 
<A NAME="257"></A>honourable reason for their departure; though perhaps it was necessary, 
<A NAME="258"></A>having such a body of slaves and fugitives collected about them, either 
<A NAME="259"></A>to come to nothing by dispersing them, or if not so, then to live with 
<A NAME="260"></A>them elsewhere. For that the inhabitants of Alba did not think fugitives 
<A NAME="261"></A>worthy of being received and incorporated as citizens among them plainly 
<A NAME="262"></A>appears from the matter of the women, an attempt made not wantonly but 
<A NAME="263"></A>of necessity, because they could not get wives by good-will. For they certainly 
<A NAME="264"></A>paid unusual respect and honour to those whom they thus forcibly 
<A NAME="265"></A>seized.
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR>Not long after the first foundation of the city, they opened a 
<A NAME="267"></A>sanctuary of refuge for all fugitives, which they called the temple of 
<A NAME="268"></A>the god Asylaeus, where they received and protected all, delivering none 
<A NAME="269"></A>back, neither the servant to his master, the debtor to his creditor, nor 
<A NAME="270"></A>the murderer into the hands of the magistrate, saying it was a privileged 
<A NAME="271"></A>place, and they could so maintain it by an order of the holy oracle; insomuch 
<A NAME="272"></A>that the city grew presently very populous, for they say, it consisted 
<A NAME="273"></A>at first of no more than a thousand houses. But of that 
<A NAME="274"></A>hereafter.
<A NAME="275"></A><BR><BR>Their minds being full bent upon building, there arose presently 
<A NAME="276"></A>a difference about the place. Romulus chose what was called Roma Quadrata, 
<A NAME="277"></A>or the Square Rome, and would have the city there. Remus laid out a piece 
<A NAME="278"></A>of ground on the Aventine Mount, well fortified by nature, which was from 
<A NAME="279"></A>him called Remonium, but now Rignarium. Concluding at last to decide the 
<A NAME="280"></A>contest by a divination from a flight of birds, and placing themselves 
<A NAME="281"></A>apart at some distance. Remus, they say, saw six vultures, and Romulus 
<A NAME="282"></A>double that number; others say, Remus did truly see his number, and that 
<A NAME="283"></A>Romulus feigned his, but when Remus came to him, that then he did indeed 
<A NAME="284"></A>see twelve. Hence it is that the Romans, in their divinations from birds, 
<A NAME="285"></A>chiefly regard the vulture, though Herodorus Ponticus relates that Hercules 
<A NAME="286"></A>was always very joyful when a vulture appeared to him upon any action. 
<A NAME="287"></A>For it is a creature the least hurtful of any, pernicious neither to corn, 
<A NAME="288"></A>fruit-tree, nor cattle; it preys only upon carrion, and never kills or 
<A NAME="289"></A>hurts any living thing; and as for birds, it touches not them, though they 
<A NAME="290"></A>are dead, as being of its own species, whereas eagles, owls, and hawks 
<A NAME="291"></A>mangle and kill their own fellow-creatures; yet, as Aeschylus 
<A NAME="292"></A>says,-
<A NAME="293"></A><BR><BR>"What bird is clean that preys on fellow bird?" Besides, all other 
<A NAME="294"></A>birds are, so to say, never out of our eyes; they let themselves be seen 
<A NAME="295"></A>of us continually; but a vulture is a very rare sight, and you can seldom 
<A NAME="296"></A>meet with a man that has seen their young; their rarity and infrequency 
<A NAME="297"></A>has raised a strange opinion in some, that they come to us from some other 
<A NAME="298"></A>world; as soothsayers ascribe a divine origination to all things not produced 
<A NAME="299"></A>either of nature or of themselves.
<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR>When Remus knew the cheat, he was much displeased; and as Romulus 
<A NAME="301"></A>was casting up a ditch, where he designed the foundation of the city-wall, 
<A NAME="302"></A>he turned some pieces of the work to ridicule, and obstructed others; at 
<A NAME="303"></A>last, as he was in contempt leaping over it, some say Romulus himself struck 
<A NAME="304"></A>him, others Celer, one of his companions; he fell, however, and in the 
<A NAME="305"></A>scuffle Faustulus also was slain, and Plistinus, who, being Faustulus's 
<A NAME="306"></A>brother, story tells us, helped to bring up Romulus. Celer upon this fled 
<A NAME="307"></A>instantly into Tuscany, and from him the Romans call all men that are swift 
<A NAME="308"></A>of feet Celeres; and because Quintus Metellus, at his father's funeral, 
<A NAME="309"></A>in a few days' time gave the people a show of gladiators, admiring his 
<A NAME="310"></A>expedition in getting it ready, they gave him the name of 
<A NAME="311"></A>Celer.
<A NAME="312"></A><BR><BR>Romulus, having buried his brother Remus, together with his two 
<A NAME="313"></A>foster-fathers, on the mount Remonia, set to building his city; and sent 
<A NAME="314"></A>for men out of Tuscany, who directed him by sacred usages and written rules 
<A NAME="315"></A>in all the ceremonies to be observed, as in a religious rite. First, they 
<A NAME="316"></A>dug a round trench about that which is now the Comitium, or Court of Assembly, 
<A NAME="317"></A>and into it solemnly threw the first-fruits of all things either good by 
<A NAME="318"></A>custom or necessary by nature; lastly, every man taking a small piece of 
<A NAME="319"></A>earth of the country from whence he came, they all threw in promiscuously 
<A NAME="320"></A>together. This trench they call, as they do the heavens, Mundus; making 
<A NAME="321"></A>which their centre, they described the city in a circle round it. Then 
<A NAME="322"></A>the founder fitted to a plough a brazen ploughshare, and, yoking together 
<A NAME="323"></A>a bull and a cow, drove himself a deep line or furrow round the bounds; 
<A NAME="324"></A>while the business of those that followed after was to see that whatever 
<A NAME="325"></A>earth was thrown up should be turned all inwards towards the city; and 
<A NAME="326"></A>not to let any clod lie outside. With this line they described the wall, 
<A NAME="327"></A>and called it, by a contraction, Pomoerium, that is, postmurum, after or 
<A NAME="328"></A>beside the wall; and where they designed to make a gate, there they took 
<A NAME="329"></A>out the share, carried the plough over, and left a space; for which reason 
<A NAME="330"></A>they consider the whole wall as holy, except where the gates are; for had 
<A NAME="331"></A>they adjudged them also sacred, they could not, without offence to religion, 
<A NAME="332"></A>have given free ingress and egress for the necessaries of human life, some 
<A NAME="333"></A>of which are in themselves unclean.
<A NAME="334"></A><BR><BR>As for the day they began to build the city, it is universally 
<A NAME="335"></A>agreed to have been the twenty-first of April, and that day the Romans 
<A NAME="336"></A>annually keep holy, calling it their country's birthday. At first, they 
<A NAME="337"></A>say, they sacrificed no living creature on this day, thinking it fit to 
<A NAME="338"></A>preserve the feast of their country's birthday pure and without stain of 
<A NAME="339"></A>blood. Yet before ever the city was built, there was a feast of herdsmen 
<A NAME="340"></A>and shepherds kept on this day, which went by the name of Palilia. The 
<A NAME="341"></A>Roman and Greek months have now little or no agreement; they say, however, 
<A NAME="342"></A>the day on which Romulus began to build was quite certainly the thirtieth 
<A NAME="343"></A>of the month, at which time there was an eclipse of the sun which they 
<A NAME="344"></A>conceived to be that seen by Antimachus, the Teian poet, in the third year 
<A NAME="345"></A>of the sixth Olympiad. In the times of Varro the philosopher, a man deeply 
<A NAME="346"></A>read in Roman history, lived one Tarrutius, his familiar acquaintance, 
<A NAME="347"></A>a good philosopher and mathematician, and one, too, that out of curiosity 
<A NAME="348"></A>had studied the way of drawing schemes and tables, and was thought to be 
<A NAME="349"></A>a proficient in the art; to him Varro propounded to cast Romulus's nativity, 
<A NAME="350"></A>even to the first day and hour, making his deductions from the several 
<A NAME="351"></A>events of the man's life which he should be informed of, exactly as in 
<A NAME="352"></A>working back a geometrical problem; for it belonged, he said, to the same 
<A NAME="353"></A>science both to foretell a man's life by knowing the time of his birth, 
<A NAME="354"></A>and also to find out his birth by the knowledge of his life. This task 
<A NAME="355"></A>Tarrutius undertook, and first looking into the actions and casualties 
<A NAME="356"></A>of the man, together with the time of his life and manner of his death, 
<A NAME="357"></A>and then comparing all these remarks together, he very confidently and 
<A NAME="358"></A>positively pronounced that Romulus was conceived in his mother's womb the 
<A NAME="359"></A>first year of the second Olympiad, the twenty-third day of the month the 
<A NAME="360"></A>Aegyptians call Choeac, and the third hour after sunset, at which time 
<A NAME="361"></A>there was a total eclipse of the sun; that he was born the twenty-first 
<A NAME="362"></A>day of the month Thoth, about sunrising; and that the first stone of Rome 
<A NAME="363"></A>was laid by him the ninth day of the month Pharmuthi, between the second 
<A NAME="364"></A>and third hour. For the fortunes of cities as well as of men, they think, 
<A NAME="365"></A>have their certain periods of time prefixed, which may be collected and 
<A NAME="366"></A>foreknown from the position of the stars at their first foundation. But 
<A NAME="367"></A>these and the like relations may perhaps not so much take and delight the 
<A NAME="368"></A>reader with their novelty and curiosity, as offend him by their 
<A NAME="369"></A>extravagance.
<A NAME="370"></A><BR><BR>The city now being built, Romulus enlisted all that were of age 
<A NAME="371"></A>to bear arms into military companies, each company consisting of three 
<A NAME="372"></A>thousand footmen and three hundred horse. These companies were called legions, 
<A NAME="373"></A>because they were the choicest and most select of the people for fighting 
<A NAME="374"></A>men. The rest of the multitude he called the people; an hundred of the 
<A NAME="375"></A>most eminent he chose for counsellors; these he styled patricians, and 
<A NAME="376"></A>their assembly the senate, which signifies a council of elders. The patricians, 
<A NAME="377"></A>some say, were so called because they were the fathers of lawful children; 
<A NAME="378"></A>others, because they could give a good account who their own fathers were, 
<A NAME="379"></A>which not every one of the rabble that poured into the city at first could 
<A NAME="380"></A>do; others, from patronage, their word for protection of inferiors, the 
<A NAME="381"></A>origin of which they attribute to Patron, one of those that came over with 
<A NAME="382"></A>Evander, who was a great protector and defender of the weak and needy. 
<A NAME="383"></A>But perhaps the most probable judgment might be, that Romulus, esteeming 
<A NAME="384"></A>it the duty of the chiefest and wealthiest men, with a fatherly care and 
<A NAME="385"></A>concern to look after the meaner, and also encouraging the commonalty not 
<A NAME="386"></A>to dread or be aggrieved at the honours of their superiors, but to love 
<A NAME="387"></A>and respect them, and to think and call them their fathers, might from 
<A NAME="388"></A>hence give them the name of patricians. For at this very time all foreigners 
<A NAME="389"></A>give senators the style of lords; but the Romans, making use of a more 
<A NAME="390"></A>honourable and less invidious name, call them Patres Conscripti; at first, 
<A NAME="391"></A>indeed, simply Patres, but afterwards, more being added, Patres Conscripti. 
<A NAME="392"></A>By this more imposing title he distinguished the senate from the populace; 
<A NAME="393"></A>and in other ways separated the nobles and the commons, calling them patrons, 
<A NAME="394"></A>and these their clients, by which means he created wonderful love and amity 
<A NAME="395"></A>betwixt them, productive of great justice in their dealings. For they were 
<A NAME="396"></A>always their clients' counsellors in law cases, their advocates in courts 
<A NAME="397"></A>of justice; in fine, their advisers and supporters in all affairs whatever. 
<A NAME="398"></A>These again faithfully served their patrons, not only paying them all respect 
<A NAME="399"></A>and deference, but also, in case of poverty, helping them to portion their 
<A NAME="400"></A>daughters and pay off their debts; and for a patron to witness against 
<A NAME="401"></A>his client, or a client against his patron, was what no law nor magistrate 
<A NAME="402"></A>could enforce. In aftertimes, all other duties subsisting still between 
<A NAME="403"></A>them, it was thought mean and dishonourable for the better sort to take 
<A NAME="404"></A>money from their inferiors. And so much of these matters.
<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR>In the fourth month, after the city was built, as Fabius writes, 
<A NAME="406"></A>the adventure of stealing the women was attempted and some say Romulus 
<A NAME="407"></A>himself, being naturally a martial man, and predisposed too, perhaps by 
<A NAME="408"></A>certain oracles, to believe the fates had ordained the future growth and 
<A NAME="409"></A>greatness of Rome should depend upon the benefit of war, upon these accounts 
<A NAME="410"></A>first offered violence to the Sabines, since he took away only thirty virgins, 
<A NAME="411"></A>more to give an occasion of war than out of any want of women. But this 
<A NAME="412"></A>is not very probable; it would seem rather that, observing his city to 
<A NAME="413"></A>be filled by a confluence of foreigners, a few of whom had wives, and that 
<A NAME="414"></A>the multitude in general, consisting of a mixture of mean and obscure men, 
<A NAME="415"></A>fell under contempt, and seemed to be of no long continuance together, 
<A NAME="416"></A>and hoping farther, after the women were appeased, to make this injury 
<A NAME="417"></A>in some measure an occasion of confederacy and mutual commerce with the 
<A NAME="418"></A>Sabines, he took in hand this exploit after this manner. First, he gave 
<A NAME="419"></A>it out as if he had found an altar of a certain god hid under ground; the 
<A NAME="420"></A>god they called Consus, either the god of counsel (for they still call 
<A NAME="421"></A>a consultation consilium, and their chief magistrates consules, namely, 
<A NAME="422"></A>counsellors), or else the equestrian Neptune, for the altar is kept covered 
<A NAME="423"></A>in the Circus Maximus at all other times, and only at horse-races is exposed 
<A NAME="424"></A>to public view; others merely say that this god had his altar hid under 
<A NAME="425"></A>ground because counsel ought to be secret and concealed. Upon discovery 
<A NAME="426"></A>of this altar, Romulus, by proclamation, appointed a day for a splendid 
<A NAME="427"></A>sacrifice, and for public games and shows, to entertain all sorts of people: 
<A NAME="428"></A>many flocked thither, and he himself sat in front, amidst his nobles clad 
<A NAME="429"></A>in purple. Now the signal for their falling on was to be whenever he rose 
<A NAME="430"></A>and gathered up his robe and threw it over his body; his men stood all 
<A NAME="431"></A>ready armed, with their eyes intent upon him, and when the sign was given, 
<A NAME="432"></A>drawing their swords and falling on with a great shout they ravished away 
<A NAME="433"></A>the daughters of the Sabines, they themselves flying without any let or 
<A NAME="434"></A>hindrance. They say there were but thirty taken, and from them the Curiae 
<A NAME="435"></A>or Fraternities were named; but Valerius Antias says five hundred and twenty-seven, 
<A NAME="436"></A>Juba, six hundred and eighty-three virgins: which was indeed the greatest 
<A NAME="437"></A>excuse Romulus could allege, namely, that they had taken no married woman, 
<A NAME="438"></A>save one only, Hersilia by name, and her too unknowingly; which showed 
<A NAME="439"></A>that they did not commit this rape wantonly, but with a design purely of 
<A NAME="440"></A>forming alliance with their neighbours by the greatest and surest bonds. 
<A NAME="441"></A>This Hersilia some say Hostilius married, a most eminent man among the 
<A NAME="442"></A>Romans; others, Romulus himself, and that she bore two children to him,- 
<A NAME="443"></A>a daughter, by reason of primogeniture called Prima, and one only son, 
<A NAME="444"></A>whom, from the great concourse of citizens to him at that time, he called 
<A NAME="445"></A>Aollius, but after ages Abillius. But Zenodotus the Troezenian, in giving 
<A NAME="446"></A>this account, is contradicted by many.
<A NAME="447"></A><BR><BR>Among those who committed this rape upon the virgins, there were, 
<A NAME="448"></A>they say, as it so then happened, some of the meaner sort of men, who were 
<A NAME="449"></A>carrying off a damsel, excelling all in beauty and comeliness and stature, 
<A NAME="450"></A>whom when some of superior rank that met them, attempted to take away, 
<A NAME="451"></A>they cried out they were carrying her to Talasius, a young man, indeed, 
<A NAME="452"></A>but brave and worthy; hearing that, they commended and applauded them loudly, 
<A NAME="453"></A>and also some, turning back, accompanied them with good-will and pleasure, 
<A NAME="454"></A>shouting out the name of Talasus. Hence the Romans to this very time, at 
<A NAME="455"></A>their weddings, sing Talasius for their nuptial word, as the Greeks do 
<A NAME="456"></A>Hymenaeus, because they say Talasius was very happy in his marriage. But 
<A NAME="457"></A>Sextius Sylla the Carthaginian, a man wanting neither learning nor ingenuity, 
<A NAME="458"></A>told me Romulus gave this word as a sign when to begin the onset; everybody, 
<A NAME="459"></A>therefore, who made prize of a maiden, cried out, Talasius; and for that 
<A NAME="460"></A>reason the custom continues so now at marriages. But most are of opinion 
<A NAME="461"></A>(of whom Juba particularly is one) that this word was used to new-married 
<A NAME="462"></A>women by way of incitement to good housewifery and talasia (spinning), 
<A NAME="463"></A>as we say in Greek, Greek words at that time not being as yet overpowered 
<A NAME="464"></A>by Italian. But if this be the case, and if the Romans did at the time 
<A NAME="465"></A>use the word talasia as we do, a man might fancy a more probable reason 
<A NAME="466"></A>of the custom. For when the Sabines, after the war against the Romans were 
<A NAME="467"></A>reconciled, conditions were made concerning their women, that they should 
<A NAME="468"></A>be obliged to do no other servile offices to their husbands but what concerned 
<A NAME="469"></A>spinning; it was customary, therefore, ever after, at weddings, for those 
<A NAME="470"></A>that gave the bride or escorted her or otherwise were present, sportingly 
<A NAME="471"></A>to say Talasius, intimating that she was henceforth to serve in spinning 
<A NAME="472"></A>and no more. It continues also a custom at this very day for the bride 
<A NAME="473"></A>not of herself to pass her husband's threshold, but to be lifted over, 
<A NAME="474"></A>in memory that the Sabine virgins were carried in by violence, and did 
<A NAME="475"></A>not go in of their own will. Some say, too, the custom of parting the bride's 
<A NAME="476"></A>hair with the head of a spear was in token their marriages began at first 
<A NAME="477"></A>by war and acts of hostility, of which I have spoken more fully in my book 
<A NAME="478"></A>of Questions.
<A NAME="479"></A><BR><BR>This rape was committed on the eighteenth day of the month Sextilis, 
<A NAME="480"></A>now called August, on which the solemnities of the Consualia are 
<A NAME="481"></A>kept.
<A NAME="482"></A><BR><BR>The Sabines were a numerous and martial people, but lived in small, 
<A NAME="483"></A>unfortified villages, as it befitted, they thought, a colony of the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="484"></A>to be bold and fearless; nevertheless, seeing themselves bound by such 
<A NAME="485"></A>hostages to their good behaviour, and being solicitous for their daughters, 
<A NAME="486"></A>they sent ambassadors to Romulus with fair and equitable requests, that 
<A NAME="487"></A>he would return their young women and recall that act of violence, and 
<A NAME="488"></A>afterwards, by persuasion and lawful means, seek friendly correspondence 
<A NAME="489"></A>between both nations. Romulus would not part with the young women, yet 
<A NAME="490"></A>proposed to the Sabines to enter into an alliance with them; upon which 
<A NAME="491"></A>point some consulted and demurred long, but Acron, king of the Ceninenses, 
<A NAME="492"></A>a man of high spirit and a good warrior, who had all along a jealousy of 
<A NAME="493"></A>Romulus's bold attempts, and considering particularly, from this exploit 
<A NAME="494"></A>upon the women, that he was growing formidable to all people, and indeed 
<A NAME="495"></A>insufferable, were he not chastised, first rose up in arms, and with a 
<A NAME="496"></A>powerful army advanced against him. Romulus likewise prepared to receive 
<A NAME="497"></A>him; but when they came within sight and viewed each other, they made a 
<A NAME="498"></A>challenge to fight a single duel, the armies standing by under arms, without 
<A NAME="499"></A>participation. And Romulus, making a vow to Jupiter, if he should conquer, 
<A NAME="500"></A>to carry himself, and dedicate his adversary's armour to his honour, overcame 
<A NAME="501"></A>him in combat, and a battle ensuing, routed his army also, and then took 
<A NAME="502"></A>his city; but did those he found in it no injury, only commanded them to 
<A NAME="503"></A>demolish the place and attend him to Rome, there to be admitted to all 
<A NAME="504"></A>the privileges of citizens. And indeed there was nothing did more advance 
<A NAME="505"></A>the greatness of Rome, than that she did always unite and incorporate those 
<A NAME="506"></A>whom she conquered into herself. Romulus, that he might perform his vow 
<A NAME="507"></A>in the most acceptable manner to Jupiter, and withal make the pomp of it 
<A NAME="508"></A>delightful to the eye of the city, cut down a tall oak which he saw growing 
<A NAME="509"></A>in the camp, which he trimmed to the shape of a trophy, and fastened on 
<A NAME="510"></A>it Acron's whole suit of armour disposed in proper form; then he himself, 
<A NAME="511"></A>girding his clothes about him, and crowning his head with a laurel garland, 
<A NAME="512"></A>his hair gracefully flowing, carried the trophy resting erect upon his 
<A NAME="513"></A>right shoulder, and so marched on, singing songs of triumph, and his whole 
<A NAME="514"></A>army following after, the citizens all receiving him with acclamations 
<A NAME="515"></A>of joy and wonder. The procession of this day was the origin and model 
<A NAME="516"></A>of all after triumphs. This trophy was styled an offering to Jupiter Feretrius, 
<A NAME="517"></A>from ferire, which in Latin is to smite; for Romulus prayed he might smite 
<A NAME="518"></A>and overthrow his enemy; and the spoils were called opima, or royal spoils, 
<A NAME="519"></A>says Varro, from their richness, which the word opes signifies; though 
<A NAME="520"></A>one would more probably conjecture from opus, an act; for it is only to 
<A NAME="521"></A>the general of an army who with his own hand kills his enemies' general 
<A NAME="522"></A>that this honour is granted of offering the opima spolia. And three only 
<A NAME="523"></A>of the Roman captains have had it conferred on them: first, Romulus, upon 
<A NAME="524"></A>killing Acron the Ceninensian; next, Cornelius Cossus, for slaying Tolumnius 
<A NAME="525"></A>the Tuscan; and lastly, Claudius Marcellus, upon his conquering Viridomarus, 
<A NAME="526"></A>king of the Gauls. The two latter, Cossus and Marcellus, made their entries 
<A NAME="527"></A>in triumphant chariots, bearing their trophies themselves; but that Romulus 
<A NAME="528"></A>made use of a chariot, Dionysius is wrong in asserting. History says, Tarquinius, 
<A NAME="529"></A>Damaratus's son, was the first that brought triumphs to this great pomp 
<A NAME="530"></A>and grandeur; others, that Publicola was the first that rode in triumph. 
<A NAME="531"></A>The statues of Romulus in triumph are, as may be seen in Rome, all on 
<A NAME="532"></A>foot.
<A NAME="533"></A><BR><BR>After the overthrow of the Ceninensians, the other Sabines still 
<A NAME="534"></A>protracting the time in preparations, the people of Fidenae, Crustumerium, 
<A NAME="535"></A>and Antemna joined their forces against the Romans; they in like manner 
<A NAME="536"></A>were defeated in battle, and surrendered up to Romulus their cities to 
<A NAME="537"></A>be seized, their lands and territories to be divided, and themselves to 
<A NAME="538"></A>be transplanted to Rome. All the lands which Romulus acquired, he distributed 
<A NAME="539"></A>among the citizens, except only what the parents of the stolen virgins 
<A NAME="540"></A>had; these he suffered to possess their own. The rest of the Sabines, enraged 
<A NAME="541"></A>hereat, choosing Tatius their captain, marched straight against Rome. The 
<A NAME="542"></A>city was almost inaccessible, having for its fortress that which is now 
<A NAME="543"></A>the Capitol, where a strong guard was placed, and Tarpeius their captain; 
<A NAME="544"></A>not Tarpeia the virgin, as some say who would make Romulus a fool. But 
<A NAME="545"></A>Tarpeia, daughter to the captain, coveting the golden bracelets she saw 
<A NAME="546"></A>them wear, betrayed the fort into the Sabines' hands, and asked, in reward 
<A NAME="547"></A>of her treachery, the things they wore on their left arms. Tatius conditioning 
<A NAME="548"></A>thus with her, in the night she opened one of the gates, and received the 
<A NAME="549"></A>Sabines. And truly Antigonus, it would seem, was not solitary in saying 
<A NAME="550"></A>he loved betrayers, but hated those who had betrayed; nor Caesar, who told 
<A NAME="551"></A>Rhymitalces the Thracian, that he loved the treason, but hated the traitor; 
<A NAME="552"></A>but it is the general feeling of all who have occasion for wicked men's 
<A NAME="553"></A>service, as people have for the poison of venomous beasts; they are glad 
<A NAME="554"></A>of them while they are of use, and abhor their baseness when it is over. 
<A NAME="555"></A>And so then did Tatius behave towards Tarpeia, for he commanded the Sabines, 
<A NAME="556"></A>in regard to their contract, not to refuse her the least part of what they 
<A NAME="557"></A>wore on their left arms; and he himself first took his bracelet off his 
<A NAME="558"></A>arm, and threw that, together with his buckler, at her; and all the rest 
<A NAME="559"></A>following, she, being borne down and quite buried with the multitude of 
<A NAME="560"></A>gold and their shields, died under the weight and pressure of them; Tarpeius 
<A NAME="561"></A>also himself, being prosecuted by Romulus, was found guilty of treason, 
<A NAME="562"></A>as Juba says Sulpicius Galba relates. Those who write otherwise concerning 
<A NAME="563"></A>Tarpeia, as that she was the daughter of Tatius, the Sabine captain, and 
<A NAME="564"></A>being forcibly detained by Romulus, acted and suffered thus by her father's 
<A NAME="565"></A>contrivance, speak very absurdly, of whom Antigonus is one. And Simylus, 
<A NAME="566"></A>the poet, who thinks Tarpeia betrayed the Capitol, not to the Sabines, 
<A NAME="567"></A>but the Gauls, having fallen in love with their king, talks mere folly, 
<A NAME="568"></A>saying thus:-
<A NAME="569"></A><BR><BR>"Tarpeia 'twas, who, dwelling close thereby,
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>Laid open Rome unto the enemy,
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>She, for the love of the besieging Gaul,
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>Betrayed the city's strength, the Capitol."
<A NAME="573"></A><BR><BR>And a little after, speaking of her death:-
<A NAME="574"></A><BR><BR>"The numerous nations of the Celtic foe
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>Bore her not living to the banks of Po;
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>Their heavy shields upon the maid they threw,
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>And with their splendid gifts entombed at once and 
<A NAME="578"></A>slew."
<A NAME="579"></A><BR><BR>Tarpeia afterwards was buried there, and the hill from her was 
<A NAME="580"></A>called Tarpeius, until the reign of King Tarquin, who dedicated the place 
<A NAME="581"></A>to Jupiter, at which time her bones were removed, and so it lost her name, 
<A NAME="582"></A>except only that part of the Capitol which they still called the Tarpeian 
<A NAME="583"></A>Rock, from which they used to cast down malefactors.
<A NAME="584"></A><BR><BR>The Sabines being possessed of the hill, Romulus, in great fury, 
<A NAME="585"></A>bade them battle, and Tatius was confident to accept it, perceiving, if 
<A NAME="586"></A>they were overpowered, that they had behind them a secure retreat. The 
<A NAME="587"></A>level in the middle, where they were to join battle, being surrounded with 
<A NAME="588"></A>many little hills seemed to enforce both parties to a sharp and desperate 
<A NAME="589"></A>conflict, by reason of the difficulties of the place, which had but a few 
<A NAME="590"></A>outlets, inconvenient either for refuge or pursuit. It happened, too, the 
<A NAME="591"></A>river having overflowed not many days before, there was left behind in 
<A NAME="592"></A>the plain, where now the forum stands, a deep blind mud and slime, which, 
<A NAME="593"></A>though it did not appear much to the eye, and was not easily avoided, at 
<A NAME="594"></A>bottom was deceitful and dangerous; upon which the Sabines being unwarily 
<A NAME="595"></A>about to enter, met with a piece of good fortune; for Curtius, a gallant 
<A NAME="596"></A>man, eager of honour, and of aspiring thoughts, being mounted on horseback, 
<A NAME="597"></A>was galloping on before the rest, and mired his horse here, and, endeavouring 
<A NAME="598"></A>for a while, by whip and spur and voice to disentangle him, but finding 
<A NAME="599"></A>it impossible, quitted him and saved himself; the place from him to this 
<A NAME="600"></A>very time is called the Curtian Lake. The Sabines, having avoided this 
<A NAME="601"></A>danger, began the fight very smartly, the fortune of the day being very 
<A NAME="602"></A>dubious, though many were slain; amongst whom was Hostilius, who, they 
<A NAME="603"></A>say, was husband to Hersilia, and grandfather to that Hostilius who reigned 
<A NAME="604"></A>after Numa. There were many other brief conflicts, we may suppose, but 
<A NAME="605"></A>the most memorable was the last, in which Romulus, having received a wound 
<A NAME="606"></A>on his head by a stone, and being almost felled to the ground by it, and 
<A NAME="607"></A>disabled, the Romans gave way, and, being driven out of the level ground, 
<A NAME="608"></A>fled towards the Palatium. Romulus, by this time recovering from his wound 
<A NAME="609"></A>a little, turned about to renew the battle, and, facing the fliers, with 
<A NAME="610"></A>a loud voice encouraged them to stand and fight. But being overborne with 
<A NAME="611"></A>numbers, and nobody daring to face about, stretching out his hands to heaven, 
<A NAME="612"></A>he prayed to Jupiter to stop the army, and not to neglect, but maintain 
<A NAME="613"></A>the Roman cause, now in extreme danger. The prayer was no sooner made, 
<A NAME="614"></A>than shame and respect for their king checked many; the fears of the fugitives 
<A NAME="615"></A>changed suddenly into confidence. The place they first stood at was where 
<A NAME="616"></A>now is the temple of Jupiter Stator (which may be translated the Stayer); 
<A NAME="617"></A>there they rallied again into ranks and repulsed the Sabines to the place 
<A NAME="618"></A>called now Regia, and to the temple of Vesta; where both parties, preparing 
<A NAME="619"></A>to begin a second battle, were prevented by a spectacle, strange to behold, 
<A NAME="620"></A>and defying description. For the daughters of the Sabines, who had been 
<A NAME="621"></A>carried off, came running, in great confusion, some on this side, some 
<A NAME="622"></A>on that, with miserable cries and lamentations, like creatures possessed, 
<A NAME="623"></A>in the midst of the army and among the dead bodies, to come at their husbands 
<A NAME="624"></A>and their fathers, some with their young babes in their arms, others their 
<A NAME="625"></A>hair loose about their ears, but all calling, now upon the Sabines, now 
<A NAME="626"></A>upon the Romans, in the most tender and endearing words. Hereupon both 
<A NAME="627"></A>melted into compassion, and fell back, to make room for them betwixt the 
<A NAME="628"></A>armies. The sight of the women carried sorrow and commiseration upon both 
<A NAME="629"></A>sides into the hearts of all, but still more their words, which began with 
<A NAME="630"></A>expostulation and upbraiding, and ended with entreaty and 
<A NAME="631"></A>supplication.
<A NAME="632"></A><BR><BR>"Wherein," say they, "have we injured or offended you, as to deserve 
<A NAME="633"></A>such sufferings past and present? We were ravished away unjustly and violently 
<A NAME="634"></A>by those whose now we are; that being done, we were so long neglected by 
<A NAME="635"></A>our fathers, our brothers and countrymen, that time, having now by the 
<A NAME="636"></A>strictest bonds united us to those we once mortally hated, has made it 
<A NAME="637"></A>impossible for us not to tremble at the danger and weep at the death of 
<A NAME="638"></A>the very men who once used violence to us. You did not come to vindicate 
<A NAME="639"></A>our honour, while we were virgins, against our assailants; but do come 
<A NAME="640"></A>now to force away wives from their husbands and mothers from their children, 
<A NAME="641"></A>a succour more grievous to its wretched objects than the former betrayal 
<A NAME="642"></A>and neglect of them. Which shall we call the worst, their love-making or 
<A NAME="643"></A>your compassion? If you were making war upon any other occasion, for our 
<A NAME="644"></A>sakes you ought to withhold your hands from those to whom we have made 
<A NAME="645"></A>you fathers-in-law and grandsires. If it be for our own cause, then take 
<A NAME="646"></A>us, and with us your sons-in-law and grandchildren. Restore to us our parents 
<A NAME="647"></A>and kindred, but do not rob us of our children and husbands. Make us not, 
<A NAME="648"></A>we entreat you, twice captives." Hersilia having spoken many such words 
<A NAME="649"></A>as these, and the others earnestly praying, a truce was made, and the chief 
<A NAME="650"></A>officers came to a parley; the women, in the meantime, brought and presented 
<A NAME="651"></A>their husbands and children to their fathers and brothers; gave those that 
<A NAME="652"></A>wanted meat and drink, and carried the wounded home to be cured, and showed 
<A NAME="653"></A>also how much they governed within doors, and how indulgent their husbands 
<A NAME="654"></A>were to them, in demeaning themselves towards them with all kindness and 
<A NAME="655"></A>respect imaginable. Upon this, conditions were agreed upon, that what women 
<A NAME="656"></A>pleased might stay where they were, exempt, as aforesaid, from all drudgery 
<A NAME="657"></A>and labour but spinning; that the Romans and Sabines should inhabit the 
<A NAME="658"></A>city together; that the city should be called Rome from Romulus; but the 
<A NAME="659"></A>Romans, Quirites, from the country of Tatius; and that they both should 
<A NAME="660"></A>govern and command in common. The place of the ratification is still called 
<A NAME="661"></A>Comitium, from come to meet.
<A NAME="662"></A><BR><BR>The city being thus doubled in number, an hundred of the Sabines 
<A NAME="663"></A>were elected senators, and the legions were increased to six thousand foot 
<A NAME="664"></A>and six hundred horse; then they divided the people into three tribes: 
<A NAME="665"></A>the first, from Romulus, named Ramnenses; the second from Tatius, Tatienses; 
<A NAME="666"></A>the third Luceres, from the lucus, or grove, where the Asylum stood, whither 
<A NAME="667"></A>many fled for sanctuary, and were received into the city. And that they 
<A NAME="668"></A>were just three, the very name of tribe and tribune seems to show; each 
<A NAME="669"></A>tribe contained ten curiae, or brotherhoods, which, some say, took their 
<A NAME="670"></A>names from the Sabine women; but that seems to be false, because many had 
<A NAME="671"></A>their names from various places. Though it is true, they then constituted 
<A NAME="672"></A>many things in honour to the women; as to give them the way wherever they 
<A NAME="673"></A>met them; to speak no ill word in their presence; not to appear naked before 
<A NAME="674"></A>them, or else be liable to prosecution before the judge, of homicide; that 
<A NAME="675"></A>their children should wear an ornament about their necks called the bulla 
<A NAME="676"></A>(because it was like a bubble), and the proetexta, a gown edged with 
<A NAME="677"></A>purple.
<A NAME="678"></A><BR><BR>The princes did not immediately join in council together, but at 
<A NAME="679"></A>first each met with his own hundred; afterwards all assembled together. 
<A NAME="680"></A>Tatius dwelt where now the temple of Moneta stands, and Romulus, close 
<A NAME="681"></A>by the steps, as they call them, of the Fair Shore, near the descent from 
<A NAME="682"></A>the Mount Palatine to the Circus Maximus. There, they say, grew the holy 
<A NAME="683"></A>cornel tree, of which they report, that Romulus once, to try his strength, 
<A NAME="684"></A>threw a dart from the Aventine Mount, the staff of which was made of cornel, 
<A NAME="685"></A>which struck so deep into the ground, that no one of many that tried could 
<A NAME="686"></A>pluck it up, and the soil being fertile, gave nourishment to the wood, 
<A NAME="687"></A>which sent forth branches, and produced a cornel stock of considerable 
<A NAME="688"></A>bigness. This did posterity preserve and worship as one of the most sacred 
<A NAME="689"></A>things; and therefore walled it about; and if to any one it appeared not 
<A NAME="690"></A>green nor flourishing, but inclining to pine and wither, he immediately 
<A NAME="691"></A>made outcry to all he met, and they, like people hearing of a house on 
<A NAME="692"></A>fire, with one accord would cry for water, and run from all parts with 
<A NAME="693"></A>buckets full to the place. But when Caius Caesar, they say, was repairing 
<A NAME="694"></A>the steps about it, some of the labourers digging too close, the roots 
<A NAME="695"></A>were destroyed, and the tree withered.
<A NAME="696"></A><BR><BR>The Sabines adopted the Roman months, of which whatever is remarkable 
<A NAME="697"></A>is mentioned in the Life of Numa. Romulus, on the other hand, adopted their 
<A NAME="698"></A>long shields, and changed his own armour and that of all the Romans, who 
<A NAME="699"></A>before wore round targets of the Argive pattern. Feasts and sacrifices 
<A NAME="700"></A>they partook of in common, not abolishing any which either nation observed 
<A NAME="701"></A>before, and instituting several new ones; of which one was the Matronalia, 
<A NAME="702"></A>instituted in honour of the women, for their extinction of the war; likewise 
<A NAME="703"></A>the Carmentalia. This Carmenta some think a deity presiding over human 
<A NAME="704"></A>birth; for which reason she is much honoured by mothers. Others say she 
<A NAME="705"></A>was the wife of Evander, the Arcadian, being a prophetess, and wont to 
<A NAME="706"></A>deliver her oracles in verse, and from carmen, a verse, was called Carmenta; 
<A NAME="707"></A>her proper name being Nicostrata. Others more probably derive Carmenta 
<A NAME="708"></A>from carens mente, or insane, in allusion to her prophetic frenzies. Of 
<A NAME="709"></A>the feast of Palilia we have spoken before. The Lupercalia, by the time 
<A NAME="710"></A>of its celebration, may seem to be a feast of purification, for it is solemnised 
<A NAME="711"></A>on the dies nefasti, or non-court days, of the month February, which name 
<A NAME="712"></A>signifies purification, and the very day of the feast was anciently called 
<A NAME="713"></A>Februata; but its name is equivalent to the Greek Lycaea; and it seems 
<A NAME="714"></A>thus to be of great antiquity, and brought in by the Arcadians who came 
<A NAME="715"></A>with Evander. Yet this is but dubious, for it may come as well from the 
<A NAME="716"></A>wolf that nursed Romulus; and we see the Luperci, the priests, begin their 
<A NAME="717"></A>course from the place where they say Romulus was exposed. But the ceremonies 
<A NAME="718"></A>performed in it render the origin of the thing more difficult to be guessed 
<A NAME="719"></A>at; for there are goats killed, then, two young noblemen's sons being brought, 
<A NAME="720"></A>some are to stain their foreheads with the bloody knife, others presently 
<A NAME="721"></A>to wipe it off with wool dipped in milk; then the young boys must laugh 
<A NAME="722"></A>after their foreheads are wiped; that done, having cut the goats' skins 
<A NAME="723"></A>into thongs, they run about naked, only with something about their middle, 
<A NAME="724"></A>lashing all they meet; and the young wives do not avoid their strokes, 
<A NAME="725"></A>fancying they will help conception and childbirth. Another thing peculiar 
<A NAME="726"></A>to this feast is for the Luperci to sacrifice a dog. But, as a certain 
<A NAME="727"></A>poet who wrote fabulous explanations of Roman customs in elegiac verses, 
<A NAME="728"></A>says, that Romulus and Remus, after the conquest of Amulius, ran joyfully 
<A NAME="729"></A>to the place where the wolf gave them suck; and that, in imitation of that, 
<A NAME="730"></A>this feast was held, and two young noblemen ran-
<A NAME="731"></A><BR><BR>"Striking at all, as when from Alba town,
<A NAME="732"></A><BR>With sword in hand, the twins came hurrying down;" and that the bloody 
<A NAME="733"></A>knife applied to their foreheads was a sign of the danger and bloodshed 
<A NAME="734"></A>of that day; the cleansing of them in milk, a remembrance of their food 
<A NAME="735"></A>and nourishment. Caius Acilius writes, that, before the city was built, 
<A NAME="736"></A>the cattle of Romulus and Remus one day going astray, they, praying to 
<A NAME="737"></A>the god Faunus, ran out to seek them naked, wishing not to be troubled 
<A NAME="738"></A>with sweat, and that this is why the Luperci run naked. If the sacrifice 
<A NAME="739"></A>be by way of purification, a dog might very well be sacrificed, for the 
<A NAME="740"></A>Greeks, in their illustrations, carry out young dogs, and frequently use 
<A NAME="741"></A>this ceremony of periscylacismus, as they call it. Or if again it is a 
<A NAME="742"></A>sacrifice of gratitude to the wolf that nourished and preserved Romulus, 
<A NAME="743"></A>there is good reason in killing a dog, as being an enemy to wolves. Unless, 
<A NAME="744"></A>indeed, after all, the creature is punished for hindering the Luperci in 
<A NAME="745"></A>their running.
<A NAME="746"></A><BR><BR>They say, too, Romulus was the first that consecrated holy fire, 
<A NAME="747"></A>and instituted holy virgins to keep it, called vestals; others ascribe 
<A NAME="748"></A>it to Numa Pompilius; agreeing, however, that Romulus was otherwise eminently 
<A NAME="749"></A>religious, and skilled in divination, and for that reason carried the lituus, 
<A NAME="750"></A>a crooked rod with which soothsayers describe the quarters of the heavens, 
<A NAME="751"></A>when they sit to observe the flights of birds. This of his, being kept 
<A NAME="752"></A>in the Palatium, was lost when the city was taken by the Gauls; and afterwards, 
<A NAME="753"></A>that barbarous people being driven out, was found in the ruins, under a 
<A NAME="754"></A>great heap of ashes, untouched by the fire, all things about it being consumed 
<A NAME="755"></A>and burnt. He instituted also certain laws, one of which is somewhat severe, 
<A NAME="756"></A>which suffers not a wife to leave her husband, but grants a husband power 
<A NAME="757"></A>to turn off his wife, either upon poisoning her children or counterfeiting 
<A NAME="758"></A>his keys, or for adultery; but if the husband upon any other occasion put 
<A NAME="759"></A>her away, he ordered one moiety of his estate to be given to the wife, 
<A NAME="760"></A>the other to fall to the goddess Ceres; and whoever cast off his wife, 
<A NAME="761"></A>to make an atonement by sacrifice to the gods of the dead. This, too, is 
<A NAME="762"></A>observable as a singular thing in Romulus, that he appointed no punishment 
<A NAME="763"></A>for real parricide, but called all murder so, thinking the one an accursed 
<A NAME="764"></A>thing, but the other a thing impossible; and, for a long time, his judgment 
<A NAME="765"></A>seemed to have been right; for in almost six hundred years together, nobody 
<A NAME="766"></A>committed the like in Rome; and Lucius Hostius, after the wars of Hannibal, 
<A NAME="767"></A>is recorded to have been the first parricide. Let this much suffice concerning 
<A NAME="768"></A>these matters.
<A NAME="769"></A><BR><BR>In the fifth year of the reign of Tatius, some of his friends and 
<A NAME="770"></A>kinsmen, meeting ambassadors coming from Laurentum to Rome, attempted on 
<A NAME="771"></A>the road to take away their money by force, and, upon their resistance, 
<A NAME="772"></A>killed them. So great a villainy having been committed Romulus thought 
<A NAME="773"></A>the malefactors ought at once to be punished, but Tatius shuffled off and 
<A NAME="774"></A>deferred the execution of it; and this one thing was the beginning of open 
<A NAME="775"></A>quarrel betwixt them; in all other respects they were very careful of their 
<A NAME="776"></A>conduct, and administered affairs together with great unanimity. The relations 
<A NAME="777"></A>of the slain, being debarred of lawful satisfaction by reason of Tatius, 
<A NAME="778"></A>fell upon him as he was sacrificing with Romulus at Lavinium and slew him; 
<A NAME="779"></A>but escorted Romulus home, commending and extolling him for a just prince. 
<A NAME="780"></A>Romulus took the body of Tatius, and buried it very splendidly in the Aventine 
<A NAME="781"></A>Mount, near the place called Armilustrium, but altogether neglected revenging 
<A NAME="782"></A>his murder. Some authors write, that the city of Laurentum, fearing the 
<A NAME="783"></A>consequences, delivered up the murderers of Tatius; but Romulus dismissed 
<A NAME="784"></A>them, saying one murder was requited with another. This gave occasion of 
<A NAME="785"></A>talk and jealousy, as if he were well pleased at the removal of his co-partner 
<A NAME="786"></A>in the government. Nothing of these things, however, raised any sort of 
<A NAME="787"></A>feud or disturbance among the Sabines; but some out of love to him, others 
<A NAME="788"></A>out of fear of his power, some again reverencing him as a god, they all 
<A NAME="789"></A>continued living peacefully in admiration and awe of him; many foreign 
<A NAME="790"></A>nations, too, showed respect to Romulus; the Ancient Latins sent and entered 
<A NAME="791"></A>into league and confederacy with him. Fidenae he took, a neighbouring city 
<A NAME="792"></A>to Rome, by a party of horse, as some say, whom he sent before with commands 
<A NAME="793"></A>to cut down the hinges of the gates, himself afterwards unexpectedly coming 
<A NAME="794"></A>up. Others say, they having first made the invasion, plundering and ravaging 
<A NAME="795"></A>the country and suburbs, Romulus lay in ambush for them, and having killed 
<A NAME="796"></A>many of their men, took the city; but, nevertheless, did not raze or demolish 
<A NAME="797"></A>it, but made it a Roman colony, and sent thither, on the Ides of April, 
<A NAME="798"></A>two thousand five hundred inhabitants.
<A NAME="799"></A><BR><BR>Soon after a plague broke out, causing sudden death without any 
<A NAME="800"></A>previous sickness; it infected also the corn with unfruitfulness, and cattle 
<A NAME="801"></A>with barrenness; there rained blood, too, in the city; so that, to their 
<A NAME="802"></A>actual sufferings, fear of the wrath of the gods was added. But when the 
<A NAME="803"></A>same mischiefs fell upon Laurentum, then everybody judged it was divine 
<A NAME="804"></A>vengeance that fell upon both cities, for the neglect of executing justice 
<A NAME="805"></A>upon the murder of Tatius and the ambassadors. But the murderers or, both 
<A NAME="806"></A>sides being delivered up and punished, the pestilence visibly abated; and 
<A NAME="807"></A>Romulus purified the cities with lustrations, which, they say, even now, 
<A NAME="808"></A>are performed at the wood called Ferentina. But before the plague ceased, 
<A NAME="809"></A>the Camertines invaded the Romans and overran the country, thinking them, 
<A NAME="810"></A>by reason of the distemper, unable to resist; but Romulus at once made 
<A NAME="811"></A>head against them, and gained the victory, with the slaughter of six thousand 
<A NAME="812"></A>men, then took their city, and brought half of those be found there to 
<A NAME="813"></A>Rome, sending from Rome to Camerium double the number he left there. This 
<A NAME="814"></A>was done on the first of August. So many citizens had he to spare, in sixteen 
<A NAME="815"></A>years' time from his first founding Rome. Among other spoils he took a 
<A NAME="816"></A>brazen four-horse chariot from Camerium, which he placed in the temple 
<A NAME="817"></A>of Vulcan, setting on it his own statue, with a figure of victory crowning 
<A NAME="818"></A>him.
<A NAME="819"></A><BR><BR>The Roman cause thus daily gathering strength, their weaker neighbours 
<A NAME="820"></A>shrunk away, and were thankful to be left untouched; but the stronger, 
<A NAME="821"></A>out of fear or envy, thought they ought not to give way to Romulus but 
<A NAME="822"></A>to curb and put a stop to his growing greatness. The first were the Veientes, 
<A NAME="823"></A>a people of Tuscany, who had large possessions, and dwelt in a spacious 
<A NAME="824"></A>city; they took occasion to commence a war, by claiming Fidenae as belonging 
<A NAME="825"></A>to them; a thing not only very unreasonable, but very ridiculous, that 
<A NAME="826"></A>they, who did not assist them in the greatest extremities, but permitted 
<A NAME="827"></A>them to be slain, should challenge their lands and houses when in the hands 
<A NAME="828"></A>of others. But being scornfully retorted upon by Romulus in his answers, 
<A NAME="829"></A>they divided themselves into two bodies; with one they attacked the garrison 
<A NAME="830"></A>of Fidenae, the other marched against Romulus; that which went against 
<A NAME="831"></A>Fidenae got the victory, and slew two thousand Romans; the other was worsted 
<A NAME="832"></A>by Romulus, with the loss of eight thousand men. A fresh battle was fought 
<A NAME="833"></A>near Fidenae, and here all men acknowledge the day's success to have been 
<A NAME="834"></A>chiefly the work of Romulus himself, who showed the highest skill as well 
<A NAME="835"></A>as courage, and seemed to manifest a strength and swiftness more than human. 
<A NAME="836"></A>But what some write, that of fourteen thousand that fell that day, above 
<A NAME="837"></A>half were slain by Romulus's own hand, verges too near to fable, and is, 
<A NAME="838"></A>indeed, simply incredible; since even the Messenians are thought to go 
<A NAME="839"></A>too far in saying that Aristomenes three times offered sacrifice for the 
<A NAME="840"></A>death of a hundred enemies, Lacedaemonians, slain by himself. The army 
<A NAME="841"></A>being thus routed, Romulus, suffering those that were left to make their 
<A NAME="842"></A>escape, led his forces against the city; they, having suffered such great 
<A NAME="843"></A>losses, did not venture to oppose, but, humbly suing to him, made a league 
<A NAME="844"></A>and friendship for an hundred years; surrendering also a large district 
<A NAME="845"></A>of land called Septempagium, that is, the seven parts, as also their salt-works 
<A NAME="846"></A>upon the river, and fifty noblemen for hostages. He made his triumph for 
<A NAME="847"></A>this on the Ides of October, leading, among the rest of his many captives, 
<A NAME="848"></A>the general of the Veientes, an elderly man, but who had not, it seemed, 
<A NAME="849"></A>acted with the prudence of age; whence even now, in sacrifices for victories, 
<A NAME="850"></A>they lead an old man through the marketplace to the Capitol, apparelled 
<A NAME="851"></A>in purple, with a bulla, or child's toy, tied to it, and the crier cries, 
<A NAME="852"></A>Sardians to be sold; for the Tuscans are said to be a colony of the Sardians, 
<A NAME="853"></A>and the Veientes are a city of Tuscany.
<A NAME="854"></A><BR><BR>This was the last battle Romulus ever fought; afterwards he, as 
<A NAME="855"></A>most, nay all men, very few excepted, do, who are raised by great and miraculous 
<A NAME="856"></A>good-haps of fortune to power and greatness, so, I say, did he; relying 
<A NAME="857"></A>upon his own great actions, and growing of an haughtier mind, he forsook 
<A NAME="858"></A>his popular behaviour for kingly arrogance, odious to the people; to whom 
<A NAME="859"></A>in particular the state which he assumed was hateful. For he dressed in 
<A NAME="860"></A>scarlet, with the purple-bordered robe over it; he gave audience on a couch 
<A NAME="861"></A>of state, having always about him some young men called Celeres, from their 
<A NAME="862"></A>swiftness in doing commissions; there went before him others with staves, 
<A NAME="863"></A>to make room, with leather thongs tied on their bodies, to bind on the 
<A NAME="864"></A>moment whoever he commanded. The Latins formerly used ligare in the same 
<A NAME="865"></A>sense as now alligare, to bind, whence the name lictors, for these officers, 
<A NAME="866"></A>and bacula, or staves, for their rods, because staves were then used. It 
<A NAME="867"></A>is probable, however, they were first called litores, afterwards, by putting 
<A NAME="868"></A>in a c, lictores, or, in Greek, liturgi, or people's officers, for leitos 
<A NAME="869"></A>is still Greek for the commons, and laos for the people in 
<A NAME="870"></A>general.
<A NAME="871"></A><BR><BR>But when, after the death of his grandfather Numitor in Alba, the 
<A NAME="872"></A>throne devolving upon Romulus, he, to court the people, put the government 
<A NAME="873"></A>into their own hands, and appointed an annual magistrate over the Albans, 
<A NAME="874"></A>this taught the great men of Rome to seek after a free and anti-monarchical 
<A NAME="875"></A>state, wherein all might in turn be subjects and rulers. For neither were 
<A NAME="876"></A>the patricians any longer admitted to state affairs, only had the name 
<A NAME="877"></A>and title left them, convening in council rather for fashion's sake than 
<A NAME="878"></A>advice, where they heard in silence the king's commands, and so departed, 
<A NAME="879"></A>exceeding the commonalty only in hearing first what was done. These and 
<A NAME="880"></A>the like were matters of small moment; but when he of his own accord parted 
<A NAME="881"></A>among his soldiers what lands were acquired by war, and restored the Veientes 
<A NAME="882"></A>their hostages, the senate neither consenting nor approving of it, then, 
<A NAME="883"></A>indeed, he seemed to put a great affront upon them; so that, on his sudden 
<A NAME="884"></A>and strange disappearance a short while after, the senate fell under suspicion 
<A NAME="885"></A>and calumny. He disappeared on the Nones of July, as they now call the 
<A NAME="886"></A>month which was then Quintilis, leaving nothing of certainty to be related 
<A NAME="887"></A>of his death; only the time, as just mentioned, for on that day many ceremonies 
<A NAME="888"></A>are sill performed in representation of what happened. Neither is this 
<A NAME="889"></A>uncertainty to be thought strange, seeing the manner of the death of Scipio 
<A NAME="890"></A>Africanus, who died at his own home after supper, has been found capable 
<A NAME="891"></A>neither of proof or disproof; for some say he died a natural death, being 
<A NAME="892"></A>of a sickly habit; others that he poisoned himself; others again, that 
<A NAME="893"></A>his enemies, breaking in upon him in the night stifled him. Yet Scipio's 
<A NAME="894"></A>dead body lay open to be seen of all, and any one, from his own observation, 
<A NAME="895"></A>might form his suspicions and conjectures, whereas Romulus, when he vanished, 
<A NAME="896"></A>left neither the least part of his body, nor any remnant of his clothes 
<A NAME="897"></A>to be seen. So that some fancied the senators, having fallen upon him in 
<A NAME="898"></A>the temple of Vulcan, cut his body into pieces, and took each a part away 
<A NAME="899"></A>in his bosom; others think his disappearance was neither in the temple 
<A NAME="900"></A>of Vulcan, nor with the senators only by, but that it came to pass that, 
<A NAME="901"></A>as he was haranguing the people without the city, near a place called the 
<A NAME="902"></A>Goat's Marsh, on a sudden strange and unaccountable disorders and alterations 
<A NAME="903"></A>took place in the air; the face of the sun was darkened, and the day turned 
<A NAME="904"></A>into night, and that, too, no quiet, peaceable night, but with terrible 
<A NAME="905"></A>thunderings, and boisterous winds from all quarters; during which the common 
<A NAME="906"></A>people dispersed and fled, but the senators kept close together. The tempest 
<A NAME="907"></A>being over and the light breaking out, when the people gathered again, 
<A NAME="908"></A>they missed and inquired for their king; the senators suffered them not 
<A NAME="909"></A>to search, or busy themselves about the matter, but commanded them to honour 
<A NAME="910"></A>and worship Romulus as one taken up to the gods, and about to be to them, 
<A NAME="911"></A>in the place of a good prince, now a propitious god. The multitude, hearing 
<A NAME="912"></A>this, went away believing and rejoicing in hopes of good things from him; 
<A NAME="913"></A>but there were some, who, canvassing the matter in a hostile temper, accused 
<A NAME="914"></A>and aspersed the patricians, as men that persuaded the people to believe 
<A NAME="915"></A>ridiculous tales, when they themselves were the murderers of the 
<A NAME="916"></A>king.
<A NAME="917"></A><BR><BR>Things being in this disorder, one, they say, of the patricians, 
<A NAME="918"></A>of noble family and approved good character, and a faithful and familiar 
<A NAME="919"></A>friend of Romulus himself, having come with him from Alba, Julius Proculus 
<A NAME="920"></A>by name, presented himself in the forum; and, taking a most sacred oath, 
<A NAME="921"></A>protested before them all, that, as he was travelling on the road, he had 
<A NAME="922"></A>seen Romulus coming to meet him, looking taller and comelier than ever, 
<A NAME="923"></A>dressed in shining and flaming armour; and he, being affrighted at the 
<A NAME="924"></A>apparition, said, "Why, O king, or for what purpose have you abandoned 
<A NAME="925"></A>us to unjust and wicked surmises, and the whole city to bereavement and 
<A NAME="926"></A>endless sorrow?" and that he made answer, "It pleased the gods, O Proculus, 
<A NAME="927"></A>that we, who came from them, should remain so long a time amongst men as 
<A NAME="928"></A>we did; and, having built a city to be the greatest in the world for empire 
<A NAME="929"></A>and glory, should again return to heaven. But farewell; and tell the Romans, 
<A NAME="930"></A>that, by the exercise of temperance and fortitude, they shall attain the 
<A NAME="931"></A>height of human power; we will be to you the propitious god Quirinus." 
<A NAME="932"></A>This seemed credible to the Romans, upon the honesty and oath of the relater, 
<A NAME="933"></A>and indeed, too, there mingled with it a certain divine passion, some preternatural 
<A NAME="934"></A>influence similar to possession by a divinity; nobody contradicted it, 
<A NAME="935"></A>but, laying aside all jealousies and detractions, they prayed to Quirinus 
<A NAME="936"></A>and saluted him as a god.
<A NAME="937"></A><BR><BR>This is like some of the Greek fables of Aristeas the Proconnesian, 
<A NAME="938"></A>and Cleomedes the Astypalaean; for they say Aristeas died in a fuller's 
<A NAME="939"></A>workshop, and his friends coming to look for him, found his body vanished; 
<A NAME="940"></A>and that some presently after, coming from abroad, said they met him travelling 
<A NAME="941"></A>towards Croton. And that Cleomedes, being an extraordinarily strong and 
<A NAME="942"></A>gigantic man, but also wild and mad, committed many desperate freaks; and 
<A NAME="943"></A>at last, in a school-house, striking a pillar that sustained the roof with 
<A NAME="944"></A>his fist, broke it in the middle, so that the house fell and destroyed 
<A NAME="945"></A>the children in it; and being pursued, he fled into a great chest, and, 
<A NAME="946"></A>shutting to the lid, held it so fast, that many men, with their united 
<A NAME="947"></A>strength, could not force it open; afterwards, breaking the chest to pieces, 
<A NAME="948"></A>they found no man in it alive or dead; in astonishment at which, they sent 
<A NAME="949"></A>to consult the oracle at Delphi; to whom the prophetess made this 
<A NAME="950"></A>answer,-
<A NAME="951"></A><BR><BR>"Of all the heroes, Cleomede is last."
<A NAME="952"></A><BR><BR>They say, too, the body of Alcmena, as they were carrying her to 
<A NAME="953"></A>her grave, vanished, and a stone was found lying on the bier. And many 
<A NAME="954"></A>such improbabilities do your fabulous writers relate, deifying creatures 
<A NAME="955"></A>naturally mortal; for though altogether to disown a divine nature in human 
<A NAME="956"></A>virtue were impious and base, so again, to mix heaven with earth is ridiculous. 
<A NAME="957"></A>Let us believe with Pindar, that-
<A NAME="958"></A><BR><BR>"All human bodies yield to Death's decree,
<A NAME="959"></A><BR>The soul survives to all eternity." For that alone is derived from 
<A NAME="960"></A>the gods, thence comes, and thither returns; not with the body, but when 
<A NAME="961"></A>most disengaged and separated from it, and when most entirely pure and 
<A NAME="962"></A>clean and free from the flesh: for the most perfect soul, says Heraclitus, 
<A NAME="963"></A>is a dry light, which flies out of the body as lightning breaks from a 
<A NAME="964"></A>cloud; but that which is clogged and surfeited with body is like gross 
<A NAME="965"></A>and humid incense, slow to kindle and ascend. We must not, therefore, contrary 
<A NAME="966"></A>to nature, send the bodies, too, of good men to heaven; but we must really 
<A NAME="967"></A>believe that, according to their divine nature and law, their virtue and 
<A NAME="968"></A>their souls are translated out of men into heroes, out of heroes into demi-gods, 
<A NAME="969"></A>out of demi-gods, after passing, as in the rite of initiation, through 
<A NAME="970"></A>a final cleansing and sanctification, and so freeing themselves from all 
<A NAME="971"></A>that pertains to mortality and sense, are thus, not by human decree, but 
<A NAME="972"></A>really and according to right reason, elevated into gods admitted thus 
<A NAME="973"></A>to the greatest and most blessed perfection.
<A NAME="974"></A><BR><BR>Romulus's surname Quirinus, some say, is equivalent to Mars; others, 
<A NAME="975"></A>that he was so called because the citizens were called Quirites; others, 
<A NAME="976"></A>because the ancients called a dart or spear Quiris; thus, the statue of 
<A NAME="977"></A>Juno resting on a spear is called Quiritis, and the dart in the Regia is 
<A NAME="978"></A>addressed as Mars, and those that were distinguished in war were usually 
<A NAME="979"></A>presented with a dart; that, therefore, Romulus being a martial god, or 
<A NAME="980"></A>a god of darts, was called Quirinus. A temple is certainly built to his 
<A NAME="981"></A>honour on the mount called from him Quirinalis.
<A NAME="982"></A><BR><BR>The day he vanished on is called the Flight of the People and the 
<A NAME="983"></A>Nones of the Goats, because they go then out of the city and sacrifice 
<A NAME="984"></A>at the Goat's Marsh, and, as they go, they shout out some of the Roman 
<A NAME="985"></A>names, as Marcus, Lucius, Caius, imitating the way in which they then fled 
<A NAME="986"></A>and called upon one another in that fright and hurry. Some, however, say 
<A NAME="987"></A>this was not in imitation of a flight, but of a quick and hasty onset, 
<A NAME="988"></A>referring it to the following occasion: After the Gauls who had taken Rome 
<A NAME="989"></A>were driven out by Camillus, and the city was scarcely as yet recovering 
<A NAME="990"></A>her strength, many of the Latins, under the command of Livius Postumius, 
<A NAME="991"></A>took this time to march against her. Postumius, halting not far from Rome, 
<A NAME="992"></A>sent a herald, signifying that the Latins were desirous to renew their 
<A NAME="993"></A>former alliance and affinity (that was now almost decayed) by contracting 
<A NAME="994"></A>new marriages between both nations; if, therefore, they would send forth 
<A NAME="995"></A>a good number of their virgins and widows, they should have peace and friendship, 
<A NAME="996"></A>such as the Sabines had formerly had on the like conditions. The Romans, 
<A NAME="997"></A>hearing this, dreaded a war, yet thought a surrender of their women little 
<A NAME="998"></A>better than mere captivity. Being in this doubt, a servant-maid called 
<A NAME="999"></A>Philotis (or, as some say, Tutola), advised them to do neither, but, by 
<A NAME="1000"></A>a stratagem, avoid both fighting and the giving up of such pledges. The 
<A NAME="1001"></A>stratagem was this, that they should send herself, with other welllooking 
<A NAME="1002"></A>servant-maids, to the enemy, in the dress of free-born virgins, and she 
<A NAME="1003"></A>should in the night light up a fire signal, at which the Romans should 
<A NAME="1004"></A>come armed and surprise them asleep. The Latins were thus deceived, and 
<A NAME="1005"></A>accordingly Philotis set up a torch in a wild fig-tree, screening it behind 
<A NAME="1006"></A>with curtains and coverlets from the sight of the enemy, while visible 
<A NAME="1007"></A>to the Romans. They, when they saw it, eagerly ran out of the gates, calling 
<A NAME="1008"></A>in their haste to each other as they went out, and so, falling in unexpectedly 
<A NAME="1009"></A>upon the enemy, they defeated them, and upon that made a feast of triumph, 
<A NAME="1010"></A>called the Nones of the Goats, because of the wild fig-tree, called by 
<A NAME="1011"></A>the Romans Caprificus, or the goat-fig. They feast the women without the 
<A NAME="1012"></A>city in arbours made of fig-tree boughs, and the maid-servants gather together 
<A NAME="1013"></A>and run about playing; afterwards they fight in sport, and throw stones 
<A NAME="1014"></A>one at another, in memory that they then aided and assisted the Roman men 
<A NAME="1015"></A>in fight. This only a few authors admit for true; for the calling upon 
<A NAME="1016"></A>one another's names by day and the going out to the Goat's Marsh to do 
<A NAME="1017"></A>sacrifice seem to agree more with the former story, unless, indeed, we 
<A NAME="1018"></A>shall say that both the actions might have happened on the same day in 
<A NAME="1019"></A>different years. It was in the fifty-fourth year of his age and the thirty-eighth 
<A NAME="1020"></A>of his reign that Romulus, they tell us, left the world.
