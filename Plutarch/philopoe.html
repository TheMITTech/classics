<A NAME="2"></A>
<BR>(legendary, died 183 B.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>CLEANDER was a man of high birth and great power in the city of Mantinea, 
<A NAME="11"></A>but by the chances of the time happened to be driven from thence. There 
<A NAME="12"></A>being an intimate friendship betwixt him and Craugis, the father of Philopoemen, 
<A NAME="13"></A>who was a person of great distinction, he settled at Megalopolis, where, 
<A NAME="14"></A>while his friend lived, he had all he could desire. When Craugis died, 
<A NAME="15"></A>he repaid the father's hospitable kindness in the care of the orphan son; 
<A NAME="16"></A>by which means Philopoemen was educated by him, as Homer says Achilles 
<A NAME="17"></A>was by Phoenix, and from his infancy moulded to lofty and noble inclinations. 
<A NAME="18"></A>But Ecdemus and Demophanes had the principal tuition of him, after he was 
<A NAME="19"></A>past the years of childhood. They were both Megalopolitans; they had been 
<A NAME="20"></A>scholars in the academic philosophy, and friends to Arcesilaus, and had, 
<A NAME="21"></A>more than any of their contemporaries, brought philosophy to bear upon 
<A NAME="22"></A>action and state affairs. They had freed their country from tyranny by 
<A NAME="23"></A>the death of Aristodemus, whom they caused to be killed; they had assisted 
<A NAME="24"></A>Aratus in driving out the tyrant Nicocles from Sicyon; and, at the request 
<A NAME="25"></A>of the Cyreneans, whose city was in a state of extreme disorder and confusion, 
<A NAME="26"></A>went thither by sea, and succeeded in establishing good government and 
<A NAME="27"></A>happily settling their commonwealth. And among their best actions they 
<A NAME="28"></A>themselves counted the education of Philopoemen, thinking they had done 
<A NAME="29"></A>a general good to Greece by giving him the nurture of philosophy. And indeed 
<A NAME="30"></A>all Greece (which looked upon him as a kind of latter birth brought forth, 
<A NAME="31"></A>after so many noble leaders, in her decrepit age) loved him wonderfully; 
<A NAME="32"></A>and, as his glory grew, increased his power. And one of the Romans, to 
<A NAME="33"></A>praise him, calls him the last of the Greeks; as if after him Greece had 
<A NAME="34"></A>produced no great man, nor who deserved the name of 
<A NAME="35"></A>Greek.
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR>His person was not, as some fancy, deformed; for his likeness is 
<A NAME="37"></A>yet to be seen at Delphi. The mistake of the hostess of Megara was occasioned, 
<A NAME="38"></A>it would seem, merely by his easiness of temper and his plain manners. 
<A NAME="39"></A>This hostess having word brought her that the general of the Achaeans was 
<A NAME="40"></A>coming to her house in the absence of her husband, was all in a hurry about 
<A NAME="41"></A>providing his supper. Philopoemen, in an ordinary cloak, arriving in this 
<A NAME="42"></A>point of time, she took him for one of his own train who had been sent 
<A NAME="43"></A>on before, and bid him lend her his hand in her household work. He forthwith 
<A NAME="44"></A>threw off his cloak, and fell to cutting up the firewood. The husband returning, 
<A NAME="45"></A>and seeing him at it, "What," says he, "may this mean, O Philopoemen?" 
<A NAME="46"></A>"I am," replied he in his Doric dialect, "paying the penalty of my ugly 
<A NAME="47"></A>looks." Titus Flamininus, jesting with him upon his figure, told him one 
<A NAME="48"></A>day he had well-shaped hands and feet, but no belly: and he was indeed 
<A NAME="49"></A>slender in the waist. But this raillery was meant to the poverty of his 
<A NAME="50"></A>fortune; for he had good horse and foot, but often wanted money to entertain 
<A NAME="51"></A>and play them. These are common anecdotes told of Philopoemen.
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR>The love of honour and distinction was, in his character, not unalloyed 
<A NAME="53"></A>with feelings of personal rivalry and resentment. He made Epaminondas his 
<A NAME="54"></A>great example, and came not far behind him in activity, sagacity, and incorruptible 
<A NAME="55"></A>integrity; but his hot contentious temper continually carried him out of 
<A NAME="56"></A>the bounds of that gentleness, composure, and humanity which had marked 
<A NAME="57"></A>Epaminondas, and this made him thought a pattern rather of military than 
<A NAME="58"></A>of civil virtue. He was strongly inclined to the life of a soldier even 
<A NAME="59"></A>from his childhood, and he studied and practised all that belonged to it, 
<A NAME="60"></A>taking great delight in managing of horses and handling of weapons. Because 
<A NAME="61"></A>he was naturally fitted to excel in wrestling, some of his friends and 
<A NAME="62"></A>tutors recommended his attention to athletic exercises. But he would first 
<A NAME="63"></A>be satisfied whether it would not interfere with his becoming a good soldier. 
<A NAME="64"></A>They told him, as was the truth, that the one life was directly opposite 
<A NAME="65"></A>to the other; the requisite state of body, the ways of living, and the 
<A NAME="66"></A>exercises all different: the professed athlete sleeping much and feeding 
<A NAME="67"></A>plentifully, punctually regular in his set times of exercise and rest, 
<A NAME="68"></A>and apt to spoil all by every little excess or breach of his usual method; 
<A NAME="69"></A>whereas the soldier ought to train himself in every variety of change and 
<A NAME="70"></A>irregularity, and, above all, to bring himself to endure hunger and loss 
<A NAME="71"></A>of sleep without difficulty. Philopoemen, hearing this, not only laid by 
<A NAME="72"></A>all thoughts of wrestling and contemned it then, but when he came to be 
<A NAME="73"></A>general, discouraged it by all marks of reproach and dishonour he could 
<A NAME="74"></A>imagine, as a thing which made men, otherwise excellently fit for war, 
<A NAME="75"></A>to be utterly useless and unable to fight on necessary 
<A NAME="76"></A>occasions.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>When he left off his masters and teachers, and began to bear arms 
<A NAME="78"></A>in the incursions which his citizens used to make upon the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="79"></A>for pillage and plunder, he would always march out the first and return 
<A NAME="80"></A>the last. When there was nothing to do, he sought to harden his body, and 
<A NAME="81"></A>make it strong and active by hunting, or labouring in his ground. He had 
<A NAME="82"></A>a good estate about twenty furlongs from the town, and thither he would 
<A NAME="83"></A>go every day after dinner and supper; and when night came, throw himself 
<A NAME="84"></A>upon the first mattress in his way, and there sleep as one of the labourers. 
<A NAME="85"></A>At break of day he would rise with the rest, and work either in the vineyard 
<A NAME="86"></A>or at the plough; from thence return again to the town, and employ his 
<A NAME="87"></A>time with his friends or the magistrates in public business. What he got 
<A NAME="88"></A>in the wars he laid out on horses, or arms, or in ransoming captives; but 
<A NAME="89"></A>endeavoured to improve his own property the justest way, by tillage; and 
<A NAME="90"></A>this not slightly, by way of diversion, but thinking it his strict duty 
<A NAME="91"></A>so to manage his own fortune as to be out of the temptation of wronging 
<A NAME="92"></A>others.
<A NAME="93"></A><BR><BR>He spent much time on eloquence and philosophy, but selected his 
<A NAME="94"></A>authors, and cared only for those by whom he might profit in virtue. In 
<A NAME="95"></A>Homer's fictions his attention was given to whatever he thought apt to 
<A NAME="96"></A>raise the courage. Of all other books he was most devoted to the commentaries 
<A NAME="97"></A>of Evangelus on military tactics, and took delight, at leisure hours, in 
<A NAME="98"></A>the histories of Alexander; thinking that such reading, unless undertaken 
<A NAME="99"></A>for mere amusement and idle conversation, was to the purpose for action. 
<A NAME="100"></A>Even in speculations on military subjects it was his habit to neglect maps 
<A NAME="101"></A>and diagrams, and to put the theorems to practical proof on the ground 
<A NAME="102"></A>itself. He would be exercising his thoughts and considering as he travelled, 
<A NAME="103"></A>and arguing with those about him of the difficulties of steep or broken 
<A NAME="104"></A>ground, what might happen at rivers, ditches, or mountain-passes, in marching 
<A NAME="105"></A>in close or in open, in this or in that particular form of battle. The 
<A NAME="106"></A>truth is, he indeed took an immoderate pleasure in military operations 
<A NAME="107"></A>and in warfare, to which he devoted himself, as the special means for exercising 
<A NAME="108"></A>all sorts of virtue, and utterly contemned those who were not soldiers, 
<A NAME="109"></A>as drones and useless in the commonwealth.
<A NAME="110"></A><BR><BR>When he was thirty years of age, Cleomenes, King of the Lacedaemonians, 
<A NAME="111"></A>surprised Megalopolis by night, forced the guards, broke in, and seized 
<A NAME="112"></A>the market-place. Philopoemen came out upon the alarm, and fought with 
<A NAME="113"></A>desperate courage, but could not beat the enemy out again; yet he succeeded 
<A NAME="114"></A>in effecting the escape of the citizens, who got away while he made head 
<A NAME="115"></A>against the pursuers, and amused Cleomenes, till, after losing his horse 
<A NAME="116"></A>and receiving several wounds, with much ado he came off himself, being 
<A NAME="117"></A>the last man in the retreat. The Megalopolitans escaped to Messene, whither 
<A NAME="118"></A>Cleomenes sent to offer them their town and goods again. Philopoemen perceiving 
<A NAME="119"></A>them to be only too glad at the news, and eager to return, checked them 
<A NAME="120"></A>with a speech, in which he made them sensible, that what Cleomenes called 
<A NAME="121"></A>restoring the city was, rather, possessing himself of the citizens; and 
<A NAME="122"></A>through their means securing also the city for the future. The mere solitude 
<A NAME="123"></A>would, of itself, ere long force him away, since there was no staying to 
<A NAME="124"></A>guard empty houses and naked walls. These reasons withheld the Megalopolitans, 
<A NAME="125"></A>but gave Cleomenes a pretext to pillage and destroy a great part of the 
<A NAME="126"></A>city, and carry away a great booty.
<A NAME="127"></A><BR><BR>Awhile after King Antigonus coming down to succour the Achaeans, 
<A NAME="128"></A>they marched with their united forces against Cleomenes; who, having seized 
<A NAME="129"></A>the avenues, lay advantageously posted on the hills of Sellasia. Antigonus 
<A NAME="130"></A>drew up close by him, with a resolution to force him in his strength. Philopoemen, 
<A NAME="131"></A>with his citizens, was that day placed among the horse, next to the Illyrian 
<A NAME="132"></A>foot, a numerous body of bold fighters who completed the line of battle, 
<A NAME="133"></A>forming, together with the Achaeans, the reserve. Their orders were to 
<A NAME="134"></A>keep their ground, and not engage till from the other wing, where the king 
<A NAME="135"></A>fought in person, they should see a red coat lifted up on the point of 
<A NAME="136"></A>a spear. The Achaeans obeyed their order and stood fast, but the Illyrians 
<A NAME="137"></A>were led on by their commanders to the attack. Euclides, the brother of 
<A NAME="138"></A>Cleomenes, seeing the foot thus severed from the horse, detached the best 
<A NAME="139"></A>of his light-armed men, commanding them to wheel about, and charge the 
<A NAME="140"></A>unprotected Illyrians in the rear. This charge putting things in confusion, 
<A NAME="141"></A>Philopoemen, considering those light-armed men would be easily repelled, 
<A NAME="142"></A>went first to the king's officers to make them sensible what the occasion 
<A NAME="143"></A>required. But they not minding what he said, but slighting him as a hare-brained 
<A NAME="144"></A>fellow (as indeed he was not yet of any repute sufficient to give credit 
<A NAME="145"></A>to a proposal of such importance), he charged with his own citizens, at 
<A NAME="146"></A>the first encounter disordered, and soon after put the troops to flight 
<A NAME="147"></A>with great slaughter. Then, to encourage the king's army further, to bring 
<A NAME="148"></A>them all upon the enemy while he was in confusion, he quitted his horse, 
<A NAME="149"></A>and fighting with extreme difficulty in his heavy horseman's dress, in 
<A NAME="150"></A>rough uneven ground, full of water-courses and hollows, had both his thighs 
<A NAME="151"></A>struck through with a thonged javelin. It was thrown with great force, 
<A NAME="152"></A>so that the head came out on the other side, and made a severe, though 
<A NAME="153"></A>not a mortal, wound. There he stood awhile, as if he had been shackled, 
<A NAME="154"></A>unable to move. The fastening which joined the thong to the javelin made 
<A NAME="155"></A>it difficult to get it drawn out, nor would any about him venture to do 
<A NAME="156"></A>it. But the fight being now at the hottest, and likely to be quickly decided, 
<A NAME="157"></A>he was transported with the desire of partaking in it, and struggled and 
<A NAME="158"></A>strained so violently, setting one leg forward, the other back, that at 
<A NAME="159"></A>last he broke the shaft in two; and thus, got the pieces pulled out. Being 
<A NAME="160"></A>in this manner set at liberty, he caught up his sword, and running through 
<A NAME="161"></A>the midst of those who were fighting in the first ranks, animated his men, 
<A NAME="162"></A>and set them afire with emulation. Antigonus after the victory asked the 
<A NAME="163"></A>Macedonians, to try them, how it happened the horse had charged without 
<A NAME="164"></A>orders before the signal? They answering, that they were against their 
<A NAME="165"></A>wills forced to it by a young man of Megalopolis, who had fallen in before 
<A NAME="166"></A>his time: "This young man," replied Antigonus, smiling, "did like an experienced 
<A NAME="167"></A>commander."
<A NAME="168"></A><BR><BR>This, as was natural, brought Philopoemen into great reputation. 
<A NAME="169"></A>Antigonus was earnest to have him in his service, and offered him very 
<A NAME="170"></A>advantageous conditions, both as to command and pay. But Philopoemen, who 
<A NAME="171"></A>knew that his nature brooked not to be under another, would not accept 
<A NAME="172"></A>them; yet not enduring to live idle, and hearing of wars in Crete for practice' 
<A NAME="173"></A>sake he passed over thither. He spent some time among those very warlike, 
<A NAME="174"></A>and, at the same time, sober and temperate men, improving much by experience 
<A NAME="175"></A>in all sorts of service; and then returned with so much fame that the Achaeans 
<A NAME="176"></A>presently chose him commander of the horse. These horsemen at that time 
<A NAME="177"></A>had neither experience nor bravery, it being the custom to take any common 
<A NAME="178"></A>horses, the first and cheapest they could procure, when they were to march; 
<A NAME="179"></A>and on almost all occasions they did not go themselves, but hired others 
<A NAME="180"></A>in their places, and stayed at home. Their former commanders winked at 
<A NAME="181"></A>this, because, it being an honour among the Achaeans to serve on horseback, 
<A NAME="182"></A>these men had great power in the commonwealth, and were able to gratify 
<A NAME="183"></A>or molest whom they pleased. Philopoemen, finding them in this condition, 
<A NAME="184"></A>yielded not to any such considerations, nor would pass it over as formerly; 
<A NAME="185"></A>but went himself from town to town, where, speaking with the young men, 
<A NAME="186"></A>one by one, he endeavoured to excite a spirit of ambition and love of honour 
<A NAME="187"></A>among them, using punishment also, where it was necessary. And then by 
<A NAME="188"></A>public exercises, reviews, and contests in the presence of numerous spectators, 
<A NAME="189"></A>in a little time he made them wonderfully strong and bold, and, which is 
<A NAME="190"></A>reckoned of greatest consequence in military service, light and agile. 
<A NAME="191"></A>With use and industry they grew so perfect, to such a command of their 
<A NAME="192"></A>horses, such a ready exactness in wheeling round in their troops, that 
<A NAME="193"></A>in any change of posture the whole body seemed to move with all the facility 
<A NAME="194"></A>and promptitude, and, as it were, with the single will of one man. In the 
<A NAME="195"></A>great battle which they fought with the Aetolians and Eleans by the river 
<A NAME="196"></A>Larissus, he set them an example himself. Damophantus, general of the Elean 
<A NAME="197"></A>horse, singled out Philopoemen, and rode with full speed at him. Philopoemen 
<A NAME="198"></A>awaited his charge, and, before receiving the stroke, with a violent blow 
<A NAME="199"></A>of his spear threw him dead to the ground: upon whose fall the enemy fled 
<A NAME="200"></A>immediately. And now Philopoemen was in everybody's mouth, as a man who 
<A NAME="201"></A>in actual fighting with his own hand yielded not to the youngest, nor in 
<A NAME="202"></A>good conduct to the oldest, and there came not into the field any better 
<A NAME="203"></A>soldier or commander.
<A NAME="204"></A><BR><BR>Aratus, indeed, was the first who raised the Achaeans, inconsiderable 
<A NAME="205"></A>till then, into reputation and power, by uniting their divided cities into 
<A NAME="206"></A>one commonwealth, and establishing amongst them a humane and truly Grecian 
<A NAME="207"></A>form of government; and hence it happened, as in running waters, where, 
<A NAME="208"></A>when a few little particles of matter once stop, others stick to them, 
<A NAME="209"></A>and one part strengthening another, the whole becomes firm and solid; so 
<A NAME="210"></A>in a general weakness, when every city relying only on itself, all Greece 
<A NAME="211"></A>was giving way to an easy dissolution, the Achaeans, first forming themselves 
<A NAME="212"></A>into a body, and then drawing in their neighbours round about, some by 
<A NAME="213"></A>protection, delivering them from their tyrants, others by peaceful consent 
<A NAME="214"></A>and by naturalization, designed at last to bring all Peloponnesus into 
<A NAME="215"></A>one community. Yet while Aratus lived, they depended much on the Macedonians, 
<A NAME="216"></A>courting first Ptolemy, then Antigonus and Philip, who all took part continually 
<A NAME="217"></A>in whatever concerned the affairs of Greece. But when Philopoemen came 
<A NAME="218"></A>to a command, the Achaeans, feeling themselves a match for the most powerful 
<A NAME="219"></A>of their enemies, declined foreign support. The truth is, Aratus, as we 
<A NAME="220"></A>have written in his life, was not of so warlike a temper, but did most 
<A NAME="221"></A>by policy and gentleness, and friendships with foreign princes; but Philopoemen 
<A NAME="222"></A>being a man both of execution and command, a great soldier, and fortunate 
<A NAME="223"></A>in his first attempts, wonderfully heightened both the power and courage 
<A NAME="224"></A>of the Achaeans, accustomed to victory under his conduct.
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR>But first he altered what he found amiss in their arms and form 
<A NAME="226"></A>of battle. Hitherto they had used light, thin bucklers, too narrow to cover 
<A NAME="227"></A>the body, and javelins much shorter than pikes. By which means they were 
<A NAME="228"></A>skilful in skirmishing at a distance, but in a close fight had much the 
<A NAME="229"></A>disadvantage. Then in drawing their forces up for battle, they were never 
<A NAME="230"></A>accustomed to form in regular divisions; and their line being unprotected 
<A NAME="231"></A>either by the thick array of projecting spears or by their shields, as 
<A NAME="232"></A>in the Macedonian phalanx, where the soldiers close and their shields touch, 
<A NAME="233"></A>they were easily opened and broken. Philopoemen reformed all this, persuading 
<A NAME="234"></A>them to change the narrow target and short javelin into a large shield 
<A NAME="235"></A>and long pike; to arm their heads, bodies, thighs, and legs; and instead 
<A NAME="236"></A>of loose skirmishing, fight firmly and foot to foot. After he had brought 
<A NAME="237"></A>them all to wear full armour, and by that means into the confidence of 
<A NAME="238"></A>thinking themselves now invincible, he turned what before had been idle 
<A NAME="239"></A>profusion and luxury into an honourable expense. For being long used to 
<A NAME="240"></A>vie with each other in their dress, and furniture of their houses, and 
<A NAME="241"></A>service of their tables, and to glory in outdoing one another, the disease 
<A NAME="242"></A>by custom was grown incurable, and there was no possibility of removing 
<A NAME="243"></A>it altogether. But he diverted the passion, and brought them, instead of 
<A NAME="244"></A>these superfluities, to love useful and more manly display, and reducing 
<A NAME="245"></A>their other expenses, to take delight in appearing magnificent in their 
<A NAME="246"></A>equipage of war. Nothing then was to be seen in the shops but plate breaking 
<A NAME="247"></A>up, or melting down, gilding of breastplate, and studding bucklers and 
<A NAME="248"></A>bits with silver; nothing in the places of exercise, but horses managing, 
<A NAME="249"></A>and young men exercising their arms; nothing in the hands of the women, 
<A NAME="250"></A>but helmets and crests of feathers to be dyed, and military cloaks and 
<A NAME="251"></A>riding-frocks to be embroidered; the very sight of all which, quickening 
<A NAME="252"></A>and raising their spirits, made them contemn dangers, and feel ready to 
<A NAME="253"></A>venture on any honourable dangers. Other kinds of sumptuosity give us pleasure, 
<A NAME="254"></A>but make us effeminate; the tickling of the sense slackening the vigour 
<A NAME="255"></A>of the mind; but magnificence of this kind strengthens and heightens the 
<A NAME="256"></A>courage; as Homer makes Achilles at the sight of his new arms exulting 
<A NAME="257"></A>with joy, and on fire to use them. When Philopoemen had obtained of them 
<A NAME="258"></A>to arm, and set themselves out in this manner, he proceeded to train them, 
<A NAME="259"></A>mustering and exercising them perpetually; in which they obeyed him with 
<A NAME="260"></A>great zeal and eagerness. For they were wonderfully pleased with their 
<A NAME="261"></A>new form of battle, which being so knit and cemented together, seemed almost 
<A NAME="262"></A>incapable of being broken. And then their arms, which for their riches 
<A NAME="263"></A>and beauty they wore with pleasure, becoming light and easy to them with 
<A NAME="264"></A>constant use, they longed for nothing more than to try them with an enemy, 
<A NAME="265"></A>and fight in earnest.
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR>The Achaeans at that time were at war with Machanidas, the tyrant 
<A NAME="267"></A>of Lacedaemon, who, having a strong army, watched all opportunities of 
<A NAME="268"></A>becoming entire master of Peloponnesus. When intelligence came that he 
<A NAME="269"></A>was fallen upon the Mantineans, Philopoemen forthwith took the field, and 
<A NAME="270"></A>marched towards him. They met near Mantinea, and drew up in sight of the 
<A NAME="271"></A>city. Both, besides the whole strength of their several cities, had a good 
<A NAME="272"></A>number of mercenaries in pay. When they came to fall on, Machanidas, with 
<A NAME="273"></A>his hired soldiers, beat the spearmen and the Tarentines whom Philopoemen 
<A NAME="274"></A>had placed in the front. But when he should have charged immediately into 
<A NAME="275"></A>the main battle, which stood close and firm, he hotly followed the chase; 
<A NAME="276"></A>and instead of attacking the Achaeans, passed on beyond them, while they 
<A NAME="277"></A>remained drawn up in their place. With so untoward a beginning the rest 
<A NAME="278"></A>of the confederates gave themselves up for lost; but Philopoemen, professing 
<A NAME="279"></A>to make it a matter of small consequence, and observing the enemy's oversight, 
<A NAME="280"></A>who had thus left an opening in their main body, and exposed their own 
<A NAME="281"></A>phalanx, made no sort of motion to oppose them, but let them pursue the 
<A NAME="282"></A>chase freely, till they had placed themselves at a great distance from 
<A NAME="283"></A>him. Then seeing the Lacedaemonians before him deserted by their horse, 
<A NAME="284"></A>with their flanks quite bare, he charged suddenly, and surprised them without 
<A NAME="285"></A>a commander, and not so much as expecting an encounter, as, when they saw 
<A NAME="286"></A>Machanidas driving the beaten enemy before him, they thought the victory 
<A NAME="287"></A>already gained. He overthrew them with great slaughter (they report above 
<A NAME="288"></A>four thousand killed in the place), and then faced about against Machanidas, 
<A NAME="289"></A>who was returning with his mercenaries from the pursuit. There happened 
<A NAME="290"></A>to be a broad deep ditch between them, alongside of which both rode their 
<A NAME="291"></A>horses for a while, the one trying to get over and fly, the other to hinder 
<A NAME="292"></A>him. It looked less like the contest between two generals than like the 
<A NAME="293"></A>last defence of some wild beast brought to bay by the keen huntsman Philopoemen, 
<A NAME="294"></A>and forced to fight for his life. The tyrant's horse was mettled and strong; 
<A NAME="295"></A>and feeling the bloody spurs in his sides, ventured to take the ditch. 
<A NAME="296"></A>He had already so far reached the other side, as to have planted his fore-feet 
<A NAME="297"></A>upon it, and was struggling to raise himself with these, when Simmias and 
<A NAME="298"></A>Polyaenus, who used to fight by the side of Philopoemen, came up on horseback 
<A NAME="299"></A>to his assistance. But Philopoemen, before either of them, himself met 
<A NAME="300"></A>Machanidas; and perceiving that the horse with his head high reared covered 
<A NAME="301"></A>his master's body, turned his own a little, and holding his javelin by 
<A NAME="302"></A>the middle, drove it against the tyrant with all his force, and tumbled 
<A NAME="303"></A>him dead into the ditch. Such is the precise posture in which he stands 
<A NAME="304"></A>at Delphi in the brazen statue which the Achaeans set up of him, in admiration 
<A NAME="305"></A>of his valour in this single combat, and conduct during the whole 
<A NAME="306"></A>day.
<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR>We are told that at the Nemean games, a little after this victory, 
<A NAME="308"></A>Philopoemen being then general the second time, and at leisure on the occasion 
<A NAME="309"></A>of the solemnity, first showed the Greeks his army drawn up in full array 
<A NAME="310"></A>as if they were to fight, and executed with it all the manoeuvres of a 
<A NAME="311"></A>battle with wonderful order, strength, and celerity. After which he went 
<A NAME="312"></A>into the theatre, while the musicians were singing for the prize, followed 
<A NAME="313"></A>by the young soldiers in their military cloaks and their scarlet frocks 
<A NAME="314"></A>under their armour, all in the very height of bodily vigour, and much alike 
<A NAME="315"></A>in age, showing a high respect to their general; yet breathing at the same 
<A NAME="316"></A>time a noble confidence in themselves, raised by success in many glorious 
<A NAME="317"></A>encounters. Just at their coming in, it so happened that the musician Pylades, 
<A NAME="318"></A>with a voice well suited to the lofty style of poet, was in the act of 
<A NAME="319"></A>commencing the Persians of Timotheus-
<A NAME="320"></A><BR><BR>"Under his conduct Greece was glorious and was free." The whole 
<A NAME="321"></A>theatre at once turned to look at Philopoemen, and clapped with delight; 
<A NAME="322"></A>their hopes venturing once more to return to their country's former reputation; 
<A NAME="323"></A>and their feelings almost rising to the height of their ancient 
<A NAME="324"></A>spirit.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR>It was with the Achaeans as with young horses, which go quietly 
<A NAME="326"></A>with their usual riders, but grow unruly and restive under strangers. The 
<A NAME="327"></A>soldiers, when any service was in hand, and Philopoemen not at their head, 
<A NAME="328"></A>grew dejected and looked about for him; but if he once appeared, came presently 
<A NAME="329"></A>to themselves, and recovered their confidence and courage, being sensible 
<A NAME="330"></A>that this was the only one of their commanders whom the enemy could not 
<A NAME="331"></A>endure to face; but, as appeared in several occasions, were frighted with 
<A NAME="332"></A>his very name. Thus we find that Philip, King of Macedon, thinking to terrify 
<A NAME="333"></A>the Achaeans into subjection again, if he could rid his hands of Philopoemen, 
<A NAME="334"></A>employed some persons privately to assassinate him. But the treachery coming 
<A NAME="335"></A>to light, he became infamous, and lost his character through Greece. The 
<A NAME="336"></A>Boeotians besieging Megara, and ready to carry the town by storm, upon 
<A NAME="337"></A>a groundless rumour that Philopoemen was at hand with succour, ran away, 
<A NAME="338"></A>and left their scaling ladders at the wall behind them. Nabis (who was 
<A NAME="339"></A>tyrant of Lacedaemon after Machanidas) had surprised Messene at a time 
<A NAME="340"></A>when Philopoemen was out of command. He tried to persuade Lysippus, then 
<A NAME="341"></A>general of the Achaeans, to succour Messene: but not prevailing with him, 
<A NAME="342"></A>because, he said, the enemy being now within it, the place was irrecoverably 
<A NAME="343"></A>lost, he resolved to go himself, without order or commission, followed 
<A NAME="344"></A>merely by his own immediate fellow-citizens, who went with him as their 
<A NAME="345"></A>general by commission from nature, which had made him fittest to command. 
<A NAME="346"></A>Nabis, hearing of his coming, thought it not convenient to stay; but stealing 
<A NAME="347"></A>out of the furthest gate with his men, marched away with all the speed 
<A NAME="348"></A>he could, thinking himself a happy man if he could get off with safety. 
<A NAME="349"></A>And he did escape but Messene was rescued.
<A NAME="350"></A><BR><BR>All hitherto makes for the praise and honour of Philopoemen. But 
<A NAME="351"></A>when at the request of the Gortynians he went away into Crete to command 
<A NAME="352"></A>for them, at a time when his own country was distressed by Nabis, he exposed 
<A NAME="353"></A>himself to the charge of either cowardice, or unseasonable ambition of 
<A NAME="354"></A>honour amongst foreigners. For the Megalopolitans were then so pressed, 
<A NAME="355"></A>that, the enemy being master of the field and encamping almost at their 
<A NAME="356"></A>gates, they were forced to keep themselves within their walls, and sow 
<A NAME="357"></A>their very streets. And in the meantime, across the seas, waging war and 
<A NAME="358"></A>commanding in chief in a foreign nation, furnished his ill-wishers with 
<A NAME="359"></A>matter enough for their reproaches. Some said he took the offer of the 
<A NAME="360"></A>Gortynians, because the Achaeans chose other generals, and left him but 
<A NAME="361"></A>a private man. For he could not endure to sit still, but looking upon war 
<A NAME="362"></A>and command in it as his great business, always coveted to be employed. 
<A NAME="363"></A>And this agrees with what he once aptly said of King Ptolemy. Somebody 
<A NAME="364"></A>was praising him for keeping his army and himself in an admirable state 
<A NAME="365"></A>of discipline and exercise: "And what praise," replied Philopoemen, "for 
<A NAME="366"></A>a king of his years, to be always preparing, and never performing?" However, 
<A NAME="367"></A>the Megalopolitans, thinking themselves betrayed, took it so ill that they 
<A NAME="368"></A>were about to banish him. But the Achaeans put an end to that design by 
<A NAME="369"></A>sending their general, Aristaeus, to Megalopolis, who, though he were at 
<A NAME="370"></A>difference with Philopoemen about affairs of the commonwealth, yet would 
<A NAME="371"></A>not suffer him to be banished. Philopoemen finding himself upon this account 
<A NAME="372"></A>out of favour with his citizens, induced divers of the little neighbouring 
<A NAME="373"></A>places to renounce obedience to them, suggesting to them to urge that from 
<A NAME="374"></A>the beginning they were not subject to their taxes or laws, or any way 
<A NAME="375"></A>under their command. In these pretences he openly took their part, and 
<A NAME="376"></A>fomented seditious movements amongst the Achaeans in general against Megalopolis. 
<A NAME="377"></A>But these things happened a while after.
<A NAME="378"></A><BR><BR>While he stayed in Crete, in the service of the Gortynians, he 
<A NAME="379"></A>made war not like a Peloponnesian and Arcanian, fairly in the open field, 
<A NAME="380"></A>but fought with them at their own weapon, and turning their stratagems 
<A NAME="381"></A>and tricks against themselves, showed them they played craft against skill, 
<A NAME="382"></A>and were but children to an experienced soldier. Having acted here with 
<A NAME="383"></A>great bravery, and great reputation to himself, he returned into Peloponnesus, 
<A NAME="384"></A>where he found Philip beaten by Titus Quintius, and Nabis at war both with 
<A NAME="385"></A>the Romans and Achaeans. He was at once chosen general against Nabis but 
<A NAME="386"></A>venturing to fight by sea, met, like Epaminondas, with a result very contrary 
<A NAME="387"></A>to the general expectation and his own former reputation. Epaminondas, 
<A NAME="388"></A>however, according to some statements, was backward by design, unwilling 
<A NAME="389"></A>to give his countrymen an appetite for the advantages of the sea, lest 
<A NAME="390"></A>from good soldiers they should by little and little turn, as Plato says, 
<A NAME="391"></A>to ill mariners. And therefore he returned from Asia and the Islands without 
<A NAME="392"></A>doing anything, on purpose. Whereas Philopoemen, thinking his skill in 
<A NAME="393"></A>land-service would equally avail at sea, learned how great a part of valour 
<A NAME="394"></A>experience is, and how much it imparts in the management of things to be 
<A NAME="395"></A>accustomed to them. For he was not only put to the worst in the fight for 
<A NAME="396"></A>want of skill, but having rigged up an old ship, which had been a famous 
<A NAME="397"></A>vessel forty years before, and shipped his citizens in her, she foundering, 
<A NAME="398"></A>he was in danger of losing them all. But finding the enemy, as if he had 
<A NAME="399"></A>been driving out of the sea, had, in contempt of him besieged Gythium, 
<A NAME="400"></A>he presently set sail again, and taking them unexpectedly, dispersed and 
<A NAME="401"></A>careless after their victory, landed in the night, burnt their camp, and 
<A NAME="402"></A>killed a great number.
<A NAME="403"></A><BR><BR>A few days after, as he was marching through a rough country, Nabis 
<A NAME="404"></A>came suddenly upon him. The Achaeans were dismayed, and in such difficult 
<A NAME="405"></A>ground where the enemy had secured the advantage, despaired to get off 
<A NAME="406"></A>with safety. Philopoemen made a little halt, and, viewing the ground, soon 
<A NAME="407"></A>made it appear that the one important thing in war is skill in drawing 
<A NAME="408"></A>up an army. For by advancing only a few paces, and, without any confusion 
<A NAME="409"></A>or trouble, altering his order according to the nature of the place, he 
<A NAME="410"></A>immediately relieved himself from every difficulty, and then charging, 
<A NAME="411"></A>put the enemy to flight. But when he saw they fled, not towards the city, 
<A NAME="412"></A>but dispersed every man a different way all over the field, which for wood 
<A NAME="413"></A>and hills, brooks and hollows, was not passable by horse, he sounded a 
<A NAME="414"></A>retreat, and encamped by broad daylight. Then foreseeing the enemy would 
<A NAME="415"></A>endeavour to steal scatteringly into the city in the dark, he posted strong 
<A NAME="416"></A>parties of the Achaeans all along the watercourses and sloping ground near 
<A NAME="417"></A>the walls. Many of Nabis's men fell into their hands. For returning not 
<A NAME="418"></A>in a body, but as the chance of flight had disposed of every one, they 
<A NAME="419"></A>were caught like birds ere they could enter into the 
<A NAME="420"></A>town.
<A NAME="421"></A><BR><BR>These actions obtained him distinguished marks of affection and 
<A NAME="422"></A>honour in all the theatres of Greece, but not without the secret ill-will 
<A NAME="423"></A>of Titus Flamininus, who was naturally eager for glory, and thought it 
<A NAME="424"></A>but reasonable a consul of Rome should be otherwise esteemed by the Achaeans 
<A NAME="425"></A>than a common Arcadian; especially as there was no comparison between what 
<A NAME="426"></A>he and what Philopoemen had done for them, he having by one proclamation 
<A NAME="427"></A>restored all Greece, as much as had been subject to Philip and the Macedonians, 
<A NAME="428"></A>to liberty. After this, Titus made peace with Nabis, and Nabis was circumvented 
<A NAME="429"></A>and slain by the Aetolians. Things being then in confusion at Sparta, Philopoemen 
<A NAME="430"></A>laid hold of the occasion, and coming upon them with an army, prevailed 
<A NAME="431"></A>with some by persuasion, with others by fear, till he brought the whole 
<A NAME="432"></A>city over to the Achaeans. As it was no small matter for Sparta to become 
<A NAME="433"></A>a member of Achaea, this action gained him infinite praise from the Achaeans, 
<A NAME="434"></A>for having strengthened their confederacy by the addition of so great and 
<A NAME="435"></A>powerful a city, and not a little good-will from the nobility of Sparta 
<A NAME="436"></A>itself, who hoped they had now procured an ally who would defend their 
<A NAME="437"></A>freedom. Accordingly, having raised a sum of one hundred and twenty silver 
<A NAME="438"></A>talents by the sale of the house and goods of Nabis, they decreed him the 
<A NAME="439"></A>money, and sent a deputation in the name of the city to present it. But 
<A NAME="440"></A>here the honesty of Philopoemen showed itself clearly to be a real, uncounterfeited 
<A NAME="441"></A>virtue. For, first of all, there was not a man among them who would undertake 
<A NAME="442"></A>to make him this offer of a present, but every one excusing himself, and 
<A NAME="443"></A>shifting it off upon his fellow, they laid the office at last on Timolaus, 
<A NAME="444"></A>with whom he had lodged at Sparta. Then Timolaus came to Megalopolis, and 
<A NAME="445"></A>was entertained by Philopoemen; but struck into admiration with the dignity 
<A NAME="446"></A>of his life and manners, and the simplicity of his habits, judging him 
<A NAME="447"></A>to be utterly inaccessible to any such considerations, he said nothing, 
<A NAME="448"></A>but pretending other business, returned without a word mentioned of the 
<A NAME="449"></A>present. He was sent again, and did just as formerly. But the third time 
<A NAME="450"></A>with much ado, and faltering in his words, he acquainted Philopoemen with 
<A NAME="451"></A>the good-will of the city of Sparta to him. Philopoemen listened obligingly 
<A NAME="452"></A>and gladly; and then went himself to Sparta, where he advised them, not 
<A NAME="453"></A>to bribe good men and their friends, of whose virtue they might be sure 
<A NAME="454"></A>without charge to themselves; but to buy off and silence ill citizens, 
<A NAME="455"></A>who disquieted the city with their seditious speeches in the public assemblies; 
<A NAME="456"></A>for it was better to bar liberty of speech in enemies than friends. Thus 
<A NAME="457"></A>it appeared how much Philopoemen was above bribery.
<A NAME="458"></A><BR><BR>Diophanes being afterwards general of the Achaeans, and hearing 
<A NAME="459"></A>the Lacedaemonians were bent on new commotions, resolved to chastise them; 
<A NAME="460"></A>they, on the other side, being set upon war, were embroiling all Peloponnesus. 
<A NAME="461"></A>Philopoemen on this occasion did all he could to keep Diophanes quiet and 
<A NAME="462"></A>to make him sensible that as the times went, while Antiochus and the Romans 
<A NAME="463"></A>were disputing their pretensions with vast armies in the heart of Greece, 
<A NAME="464"></A>it concerned a man in his position to keep a watchful eye over them, and 
<A NAME="465"></A>dissembling, and putting up with any less important grievances, to preserve 
<A NAME="466"></A>all quiet at home. Diophanes would not be ruled, but joined with Titus, 
<A NAME="467"></A>and both together falling into Daconia, marched directly to Sparta. Philopoemen, 
<A NAME="468"></A>upon this, took, in his indignation, a step which certainly was not lawful, 
<A NAME="469"></A>nor in the strictest sense just, but boldly and loftily conceived. Entering 
<A NAME="470"></A>into the town himself, he, a private man as he was, refused admission to 
<A NAME="471"></A>both the consul of Rome and the general of the Achaeans, quieted the disorders 
<A NAME="472"></A>in the city, and reunited it on the same terms as before to the Achaean 
<A NAME="473"></A>confederacy.
<A NAME="474"></A><BR><BR>Yet afterwards, when he was general himself, upon some new misdemeanour 
<A NAME="475"></A>of the Lacedaemonians, he brought back those who had been banished, put, 
<A NAME="476"></A>as Polybius writes, eighty, according to Aristocrates three hundred and 
<A NAME="477"></A>fifty, Spartans to death, razed the walls, took away a good part of their 
<A NAME="478"></A>territory and transferred it to the Megalopolitans, forced out of the country 
<A NAME="479"></A>and carried into Achaea all who had been made citizens of Sparta by tyrants, 
<A NAME="480"></A>except three thousand who would not submit to banishment. These he sold 
<A NAME="481"></A>for slaves, and with the money, as if to exult over them, built a colonnade 
<A NAME="482"></A>at Megalopolis. Lastly, unworthily trampling upon the Lacedaemonians in 
<A NAME="483"></A>their calamities, and gratifying his hostility by a most oppressive and 
<A NAME="484"></A>arbitrary action, he abolished the laws of Lycurgus, and forced them to 
<A NAME="485"></A>educate their children and live after the manner of the Achaeans; as though, 
<A NAME="486"></A>while they kept to the discipline of Lycurgus, there was no humbling their 
<A NAME="487"></A>haughty spirits. In their present distress and adversity they allowed Philopoemen 
<A NAME="488"></A>thus to cut the sinews of their commonwealth asunder, and behave themselves 
<A NAME="489"></A>humbly and submissively. But afterwards, in no long time, obtaining the 
<A NAME="490"></A>support of the Romans, they abandoned their new Achaean citizenship; and 
<A NAME="491"></A>as much as in so miserable and ruined a condition they could, re-established 
<A NAME="492"></A>their ancient discipline.
<A NAME="493"></A><BR><BR>When the war betwixt Antiochus and the Romans broke out in Greece, 
<A NAME="494"></A>Philopoemen was a private man. He repined grievously when he saw Antiochus 
<A NAME="495"></A>lay idle at Chalcis, spending his time in unreasonable courtship and weddings, 
<A NAME="496"></A>while his men lay dispersed in several towns, without order, or commanders, 
<A NAME="497"></A>and minding nothing but their pleasures. He complained much that he was 
<A NAME="498"></A>not himself in office, and said he envied the Romans their victory; and 
<A NAME="499"></A>that if he had had the fortune to be then in command, he would have surprised 
<A NAME="500"></A>and killed the whole army in the taverns.
<A NAME="501"></A><BR><BR>When Antiochus was overcome, the Romans pressed harder upon Greece, 
<A NAME="502"></A>and encompassed the Achaeans with their power; the popular leaders in the 
<A NAME="503"></A>several cities yielded before them; and their power speedily, under the 
<A NAME="504"></A>divine guidance, advanced to the consummation due to it in the revolutions 
<A NAME="505"></A>of fortune. Philopoemen, in this conjecture, carried himself like a good 
<A NAME="506"></A>pilot in a high sea, sometimes shifting sail, and sometimes yielding, but 
<A NAME="507"></A>still steering steady; and omitting no opportunity nor effort to keep all 
<A NAME="508"></A>who were considerable, whether for eloquence or riches, fast to the defence 
<A NAME="509"></A>of their common liberty.
<A NAME="510"></A><BR><BR>Aristaenus, a Megalopolitan of great credit among the Achaeans, 
<A NAME="511"></A>but always a favourer of the Romans, saying one day in the senate that 
<A NAME="512"></A>the Romans should not be opposed, or displeased in any way, Philopoemen 
<A NAME="513"></A>heard him with an impatient silence; but at last, not able to hold longer, 
<A NAME="514"></A>said angrily to him, "And why be in such haste, wretched man, to behold 
<A NAME="515"></A>the end of Greece?" Manius, the Roman consul, after the defeat of Antiochus, 
<A NAME="516"></A>requested the Achaeans to restore the banished Lacedaemonians to their 
<A NAME="517"></A>country, which motion was seconded and supported by all the interest of 
<A NAME="518"></A>Titus. But Philopoemen crossed it, not from ill-will to the men, but that 
<A NAME="519"></A>they might be beholden to him and the Achaeans, not to Titus and the Romans. 
<A NAME="520"></A>For when he came to be general himself, he restored them. So impatient 
<A NAME="521"></A>was his spirit of any subjection and so prone his nature to contest everything 
<A NAME="522"></A>with men in power.
<A NAME="523"></A><BR><BR>Being now three score and ten, and the eighth time general, he 
<A NAME="524"></A>was in hope to pass in quiet, not only the year of his magistracy, but 
<A NAME="525"></A>his remaining life. For as our diseases decline, as it is supposed with 
<A NAME="526"></A>our declining bodily strength, so the quarrelling humour of the Greeks 
<A NAME="527"></A>abated much with their failing political greatness. But fortune or some 
<A NAME="528"></A>divine retributive power threw him down in the close of his life, like 
<A NAME="529"></A>a successful runner who stumbles at the goal. It is reported, that being 
<A NAME="530"></A>in company where one was praised for a great commander, he replied, there 
<A NAME="531"></A>was no great account to be made of a man who had suffered himself to be 
<A NAME="532"></A>taken alive by his enemies.
<A NAME="533"></A><BR><BR>A few days after, news came that Dinocrates the Messenian, a particular 
<A NAME="534"></A>enemy to Philopoemen, and for his wickedness and villainies generally hated, 
<A NAME="535"></A>had induced Messene to revolt from the Achaeans, and was about to seize 
<A NAME="536"></A>upon a little place called Colonis. Philopoemen lay then sick of a fever 
<A NAME="537"></A>at Argos. Upon the news he hasted away, and reached Megalopolis, which 
<A NAME="538"></A>was distant above four hundred furlongs, in a day. From thence he immediately 
<A NAME="539"></A>led out the horse, the noblest of the city, young men in the vigour of 
<A NAME="540"></A>their age, and eager to proffer their service, both from attachment to 
<A NAME="541"></A>Philopoemen and zeal for the cause. As they marched towards Messene, they 
<A NAME="542"></A>met with Dinocrates, near the hill of Evander, charged and routed him. 
<A NAME="543"></A>But five hundred fresh men, who, being left for a guard to the country, 
<A NAME="544"></A>came in late, happening to appear, the flying enemy rallied again about 
<A NAME="545"></A>the hills. Philopoemen, fearing to be enclosed, and solicitous for his 
<A NAME="546"></A>men, retreated over ground extremely disadvantageous, bringing up the rear 
<A NAME="547"></A>himself. As he often faced, and made charges upon the enemy, he drew them 
<A NAME="548"></A>upon himself; though they merely made movements at a distance, and shouted 
<A NAME="549"></A>about him, nobody daring to approach him. In his care to save every single 
<A NAME="550"></A>man, he left his main body so often, that at last he found himself alone 
<A NAME="551"></A>among the thickest of his enemies. Yet even then none durst come up to 
<A NAME="552"></A>him, but being pelted at a distance, and driven to stony steep places, 
<A NAME="553"></A>he had great difficulty, with much spurring, to guide his horse aright. 
<A NAME="554"></A>His age was no hindrance to him, for with perpetual exercise it was both 
<A NAME="555"></A>strong and active; but being weakened with sickness, and tired with his 
<A NAME="556"></A>long journey, his horse stumbling, he fell encumbered with his arms, and 
<A NAME="557"></A>faint, upon a hard and rugged piece of ground. His head received such a 
<A NAME="558"></A>shock with the fall that he lay awhile speechless, so that the enemy, thinking 
<A NAME="559"></A>him dead, began to turn and strip him. But when they saw him lift up his 
<A NAME="560"></A>head and open his eyes, they threw themselves all together upon him, bound 
<A NAME="561"></A>his hands behind him, and carried him off, every kind of insult and contumely 
<A NAME="562"></A>being lavished on him who truly had never so much as dreamed of being led 
<A NAME="563"></A>in triumph by Dinocrates.
<A NAME="564"></A><BR><BR>The Messenians, wonderfully elated with the news, thronged in swarms 
<A NAME="565"></A>to the city gates. But when they saw Philopoemen in a posture so unsuitable 
<A NAME="566"></A>to the glory of his great actions and famous victories, most of them, struck 
<A NAME="567"></A>with grief and cursing the deceitful vanity of human fortune, even shed 
<A NAME="568"></A>tears of compassion at the spectacle. Such tears by little and little turned 
<A NAME="569"></A>to kind words, and it was almost in everybody's mouth that they ought to 
<A NAME="570"></A>remember what he had done for them, and how he had preserved the common 
<A NAME="571"></A>liberty, by driving away Nabis. Some few, to make their court to Dinocrates, 
<A NAME="572"></A>were for torturing and then putting him to death as a dangerous and irreconcilable 
<A NAME="573"></A>enemy; all the more formidable to Dinocrates, who had taken him a prisoner, 
<A NAME="574"></A>should he after this misfortune regain his liberty. They put him at last 
<A NAME="575"></A>into a dungeon underground, which they called the treasury, a place into 
<A NAME="576"></A>which there came no air nor light from abroad; and which, having no doors, 
<A NAME="577"></A>was closed with a great stone. This they rolled into the entrance and fixed, 
<A NAME="578"></A>and placing a guard about it, left him. In the meantime Philopoemen's soldiers, 
<A NAME="579"></A>recovering themselves after their flight, and fearing he was dead when 
<A NAME="580"></A>he appeared nowhere, made a stand, calling him with loud cries, and reproaching 
<A NAME="581"></A>one another with their unworthy and shameful escape; having betrayed their 
<A NAME="582"></A>general, who, to preserve their lives, had lost his own. Then returning 
<A NAME="583"></A>after much inquiry and search, hearing at last that he was taken they sent 
<A NAME="584"></A>away messengers round about with the news. The Achaeans resented the misfortune 
<A NAME="585"></A>deeply, and decreed to send and demand him; and in the meantime drew their 
<A NAME="586"></A>army together for his rescue.
<A NAME="587"></A><BR><BR>While these things passed in Achaea, Dinocrates, fearing that any 
<A NAME="588"></A>delay would save Philopoemen, and resolving to be beforehand with the Achaeans, 
<A NAME="589"></A>as soon as night had dispersed the multitude, sent in the executioner with 
<A NAME="590"></A>poison, with orders not to stir from him till he had taken it. Philopoemen 
<A NAME="591"></A>had then laid down, wrapt up in his cloak, not sleeping, but oppressed 
<A NAME="592"></A>with grief and trouble; but seeing light, and a man with poison by him, 
<A NAME="593"></A>struggled to sit up; and, taking the cup, asked the man if he heard anything 
<A NAME="594"></A>of the horsemen, particularly Lycortas? The fellow answering, that most 
<A NAME="595"></A>part had got off safe, he nodded, and looking cheerfully upon him, "It 
<A NAME="596"></A>is well," he said, "that we have not been every way unfortunate;" and without 
<A NAME="597"></A>a word more, drank it off, and laid him down again. His weakness offering 
<A NAME="598"></A>but little resistance to the poison, it despatched him 
<A NAME="599"></A>presently.
<A NAME="600"></A><BR><BR>The news of his death filled all Achaea with grief and lamentation. 
<A NAME="601"></A>The youth, with some of the chief of the several cities, met at Megalopolis 
<A NAME="602"></A>with a resolution to take revenge without delay. They chose Lycortas general, 
<A NAME="603"></A>and falling upon the Messenians, put all to fire and sword, till they all 
<A NAME="604"></A>with one consent made their submission. Dinocrates, with as many as had 
<A NAME="605"></A>voted for Philopoemen's death, anticipated their vengeance and killed themselves. 
<A NAME="606"></A>Those who would have had him tortured, Lycortas put in chains and reserved 
<A NAME="607"></A>for severer punishment. They burnt his body, and put the ashes into an 
<A NAME="608"></A>urn, and then marched homeward, not as in an ordinary march, but with a 
<A NAME="609"></A>kind of solemn pomp, half triumph, half funeral, crowns of victory on their 
<A NAME="610"></A>heads, and tears in their eyes, and their captive enemies in fetters by 
<A NAME="611"></A>them. Polybius, the general's son, carried the urn, so covered with garlands 
<A NAME="612"></A>and ribbons as scarcely to be visible; and the noblest of the Achaeans 
<A NAME="613"></A>accompanied him. The soldiers followed fully armed and mounted, with looks 
<A NAME="614"></A>neither altogether sad as in mourning, nor lofty as in victory. The people 
<A NAME="615"></A>from all towns and villages in their way flocked out to meet him, as at 
<A NAME="616"></A>his return from conquest, and, saluting the urn, fell in with the company 
<A NAME="617"></A>and followed on to Megalopolis; where, when the old men, the women and 
<A NAME="618"></A>children were mingled with the rest, the whole city was filled with sighs, 
<A NAME="619"></A>complaints and cries, the loss of Philopoemen seeming to them the loss 
<A NAME="620"></A>of their own greatness, and of their rank among the Achaeans. Thus he was 
<A NAME="621"></A>honourably buried according to his worth, and the prisoners were stoned 
<A NAME="622"></A>about his tomb.
<A NAME="623"></A><BR><BR>Many statues were set up, and many honours decreed to him by the 
<A NAME="624"></A>several cities. One of the Romans in the time of Greece's affliction, after 
<A NAME="625"></A>the destruction of Corinth, publicly accusing Philopoemen, as if he had 
<A NAME="626"></A>been still alive, of having been the enemy of Rome, proposed that these 
<A NAME="627"></A>memorials should be all removed. A discussion ensued, speeches were made, 
<A NAME="628"></A>and Polybius answered the sycophant at large. And neither Mummius nor the 
<A NAME="629"></A>lieutenants would suffer the honourable monuments of so great a man to 
<A NAME="630"></A>be defaced, though he had often crossed both Titus and Manius. They justly 
<A NAME="631"></A>distinguished, and as became honest men, betwixt usefulness and virtue- 
<A NAME="632"></A>what is good in itself, and what is profitable to particular parties- judging 
<A NAME="633"></A>thanks and reward due to him who does a benefit from him who receives it, 
<A NAME="634"></A>and honour never to be denied by the good to the good. And so much concerning 
<A NAME="635"></A>Philopoemen.
