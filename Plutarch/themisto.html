<A NAME="2"></A>
<BR>(legendary, died 365 B.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>The birth of Themistocles was somewhat too obscure to do him honour. His 
<A NAME="11"></A>father, Neocles, was not of the distinguished people of Athens, but of 
<A NAME="12"></A>the township Phrearrhi, and of the tribe Leontis; and by his mother's side, 
<A NAME="13"></A>as it is reported, he was base-born-
<A NAME="14"></A><BR><BR>"I am not of the noble Grecian race,
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>I'm poor Abrotonon, and born in Thrace;
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>Let the Greek women scorn me, if they please,
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>I was the mother of Themistocles."
<A NAME="18"></A><BR><BR>Yet Phanias writes that the mother of Themistocles was not of Thrace, 
<A NAME="19"></A>but of Caria, and that her name was not Abrotonon, but Euterpe; and Neanthes 
<A NAME="20"></A>adds farther that she was of Halicarnassus in Caria. And, as illegitimate 
<A NAME="21"></A>children, including those that were of half-blood or had but one parent 
<A NAME="22"></A>an Athenian, had to attend at the Cynosarges (a wrestling-place outside 
<A NAME="23"></A>the gates, dedicated to Hercules, who was also of half-blood amongst the 
<A NAME="24"></A>gods, having had a mortal woman for his mother), Themistocles persuaded 
<A NAME="25"></A>several of the young men of high birth to accompany him to anoint and exercise 
<A NAME="26"></A>themselves together at Cynosarges; an ingenious device for destroying the 
<A NAME="27"></A>distinction between the noble and the base-born, and between those of the 
<A NAME="28"></A>whole and those of the half-blood of Athens. However, it is certain that 
<A NAME="29"></A>he was related to the house of Lycomedae; for Simonides records that he 
<A NAME="30"></A>rebuilt the chapel of Phlya, belonging to that family, and beautified it 
<A NAME="31"></A>with pictures and other ornaments, after it had been burnt by the 
<A NAME="32"></A>Persians.
<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR>It is confessed by all that from his youth he was of a vehement 
<A NAME="34"></A>and impetuous nature, of a quick apprehension, and a strong and aspiring 
<A NAME="35"></A>bent for action and great affairs. The holidays and intervals in his studies 
<A NAME="36"></A>he did not spend in play or idleness, as other children, but would be always 
<A NAME="37"></A>inventing or arranging some oration or declamation to himself, the subject 
<A NAME="38"></A>of which was generally the excusing or accusing his companions, so that 
<A NAME="39"></A>his master would often say to him, "You, my boy, will be nothing small, 
<A NAME="40"></A>but great one way or other, for good or else for bad." He received reluctantly 
<A NAME="41"></A>and carelessly instructions given him to improve his manners and behaviour, 
<A NAME="42"></A>or to teach him any pleasing or graceful accomplishment, but whatever was 
<A NAME="43"></A>said to improve him in sagacity, or in management of affairs, he would 
<A NAME="44"></A>give attention to, beyond one of his years, from confidence in his natural 
<A NAME="45"></A>capacities for such things. And thus afterwards, when in company where 
<A NAME="46"></A>people engaged themselves in what are commonly thought the liberal and 
<A NAME="47"></A>elegant amusements, he was obliged to defend himself against the observations 
<A NAME="48"></A>of those who considered themselves highly accomplished, by the somewhat 
<A NAME="49"></A>arrogant retort, that he certainly could not make use of any stringed instrument, 
<A NAME="50"></A>could only, were a small and obscure city put into his hands, make it great 
<A NAME="51"></A>and glorious. Notwithstanding this, Stesimbrotus says that Themistocles 
<A NAME="52"></A>was a hearer of Anaxagoras, and that he studied natural philosophy under 
<A NAME="53"></A>Melissus, contrary to chronology; Melissus commanded the Samians in the 
<A NAME="54"></A>siege by Pericles, who was much Themistocles's junior; and with Pericles, 
<A NAME="55"></A>also, Anaxagoras was intimate. They, therefore, might rather be credited 
<A NAME="56"></A>who report, that Themistocles was an admirer of Mnesiphilus the Phrearrhian, 
<A NAME="57"></A>who was neither rhetorican nor natural philosopher, but a professor of 
<A NAME="58"></A>that which was then called wisdom, consisting in a sort of political shrewdness 
<A NAME="59"></A>and practical sagacity, which had begun and continued, almost like a sect 
<A NAME="60"></A>of philosophy, from Solon: but those who came afterwards, and mixed it 
<A NAME="61"></A>with pleadings and legal artifices, and transformed the practical part 
<A NAME="62"></A>of it into a mere art of speaking and an exercise of words, were generally 
<A NAME="63"></A>called sophists. Themistocles resorted to Mnesiphilus when he had already 
<A NAME="64"></A>embarked in politics.
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR>In the first essays of his youth he was not regular nor happily 
<A NAME="66"></A>balanced; he allowed himself to follow mere natural character, which, without 
<A NAME="67"></A>the control of reason and instruction, is apt to hurry, upon either side, 
<A NAME="68"></A>into sudden and violent courses, and very often to break away and determine 
<A NAME="69"></A>upon the worst; as he afterwards owned himself, saying, that the wildest 
<A NAME="70"></A>colts make the best horses, if they only get properly trained and broken 
<A NAME="71"></A>in. But those who upon this fasten stories of their own invention, as of 
<A NAME="72"></A>his being disowned by his father, and that his mother died for grief of 
<A NAME="73"></A>her son's ill-fame, certainly calumniate him; and there are others who 
<A NAME="74"></A>relate, on the contrary, how that to deter him from public business, and 
<A NAME="75"></A>to let him see how the vulgar behave themselves towards their leaders when 
<A NAME="76"></A>they have at last no farther use of them, his father showed him the old 
<A NAME="77"></A>galleys as they lay forsaken and cast about upon the 
<A NAME="78"></A>sea-shore.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>Yet it is evident that his mind was early imbued with the keenest 
<A NAME="80"></A>interest in public affairs, and the most passionate ambition for distinction. 
<A NAME="81"></A>Eager from the first to obtain the highest place, he unhesitatingly accepted 
<A NAME="82"></A>the hatred of the most powerful and influential leaders in the city, but 
<A NAME="83"></A>more especially of Aristides, the son of Lysimachus, who always opposed 
<A NAME="84"></A>him. And yet all this great enmity between them arose, it appears, from 
<A NAME="85"></A>a very boyish occasion, both being attached to the beautiful Stesilaus 
<A NAME="86"></A>of Ceos, as Ariston the philosopher tells us; ever after which they took 
<A NAME="87"></A>opposite sides, and were rivals in politics. Not but that the incompatibility 
<A NAME="88"></A>of their lives and manners may seem to have increased the difference, for 
<A NAME="89"></A>Aristides was of a mild nature, and of a nobler sort of character, and, 
<A NAME="90"></A>in public matters, acting always with a view, not to glory or popularity, 
<A NAME="91"></A>but to the best interest of the state consistently with safety and honesty, 
<A NAME="92"></A>he was often forced to oppose Themistocles, and interfere against the increase 
<A NAME="93"></A>of his influence, seeing him stirring up the people to all kinds of enterprises, 
<A NAME="94"></A>and introducing various innovations. For it is said that Themistocles was 
<A NAME="95"></A>so transported with the thoughts of glory and so inflamed with the passion 
<A NAME="96"></A>for great actions, that, though he was still young when the battle of Marathon 
<A NAME="97"></A>was fought against the Persians, upon the skilful conduct of the general, 
<A NAME="98"></A>Miltiades, being everywhere talked about, he was observed to be thoughtful 
<A NAME="99"></A>and reserved, alone by himself; he passed the nights without sleep, and 
<A NAME="100"></A>avoided all his usual places of recreation, and to those who wondered at 
<A NAME="101"></A>the change, and inquired the reason of it, he gave the answer, that "the 
<A NAME="102"></A>trophy of Miltiades would not let him sleep." And when others were of opinion 
<A NAME="103"></A>that the battle of Marathon would be an end to the war, Themistocles thought 
<A NAME="104"></A>that it was but the beginning for far greater conflicts, and for these, 
<A NAME="105"></A>to the benefit of all Greece, he kept himself in continual readiness, and 
<A NAME="106"></A>his city also in proper training, foreseeing from far before what would 
<A NAME="107"></A>happen.
<A NAME="108"></A><BR><BR>And, first of all, the Athenians being accustomed to divide amongst 
<A NAME="109"></A>themselves the revenue proceeding from the silver mines at Laurium, he 
<A NAME="110"></A>was the only man that durst propose to the people that this distribution 
<A NAME="111"></A>should cease, and that with the money ships should be built to make war 
<A NAME="112"></A>against the Aeginetans, who were the most flourishing people in all Greece, 
<A NAME="113"></A>and by the number of their ships held the sovereignty of the sea; and Themistocles 
<A NAME="114"></A>thus was more easily able to persuade them, avoiding all mention of danger 
<A NAME="115"></A>from Darius or the Persians, who were at a great distance, and their coming 
<A NAME="116"></A>very uncertain, and at that time not much to be feared; but by a seasonable 
<A NAME="117"></A>employment of the emulation and anger felt by the Athenians against the 
<A NAME="118"></A>Aeginetans, he induced them to preparation. So that with this money an 
<A NAME="119"></A>hundred ships were built, with which they afterwards fought against Xerxes. 
<A NAME="120"></A>And henceforward, little by little, turning and drawing the city down towards 
<A NAME="121"></A>the sea, in the belief that, whereas by land they were not a fit match 
<A NAME="122"></A>for their next neighbours, with their ships they might be able to repel 
<A NAME="123"></A>the Persians and command Greece, thus, as Plato says, from steady soldiers 
<A NAME="124"></A>he turned them into mariners and seamen tossed about the sea, and gave 
<A NAME="125"></A>occasion for the reproach against him, that he took away from the Athenians 
<A NAME="126"></A>the spear and the shield, and bound them to the bench and the oar. These 
<A NAME="127"></A>measures he carried in the assembly, against the opposition, as Stesimbrotus 
<A NAME="128"></A>relates, of Miltiades; and whether or no be hereby injured the purity and 
<A NAME="129"></A>true balance of government may be a question for philosophers, but that 
<A NAME="130"></A>the deliverance of Greece came at that time from the sea, and that these 
<A NAME="131"></A>galleys restored Athens again after it was destroyed, were others wanting, 
<A NAME="132"></A>Xerxes himself would be sufficient evidence, who, though his land-forces 
<A NAME="133"></A>were still entire, after his defeat at sea, fled away, and thought himself 
<A NAME="134"></A>no longer able to encounter the Greeks; and, as it seems to me, left Mardonius 
<A NAME="135"></A>behind him, not out of any hopes he could have to bring them into subjection, 
<A NAME="136"></A>but to hinder them from pursuing him.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR><BR>Themistocles is said to have been eager in the acquisition of riches, 
<A NAME="138"></A>according to some, that he might be the more liberal; for loving to sacrifice 
<A NAME="139"></A>often, and to be splendid in his entertainment of strangers, he required 
<A NAME="140"></A>a plentiful revenue; yet he is accused by others of having been parsimonious 
<A NAME="141"></A>and sordid to that degree that he would sell provisions which were sent 
<A NAME="142"></A>to him as a present. He desired Diphilides, who was a breeder of horses, 
<A NAME="143"></A>to give him a colt, and when he refused it, threatened that in a short 
<A NAME="144"></A>time he would turn his house into a wooden horse, intimating that he would 
<A NAME="145"></A>stir up dispute and litigation between him and some of his 
<A NAME="146"></A>relations.
<A NAME="147"></A><BR><BR>He went beyond all men in the passion for distinction. When he 
<A NAME="148"></A>was still young and unknown in the world, he entreated Episcles of Hermione, 
<A NAME="149"></A>who had a good hand at the lute and was much sought after by the Athenians, 
<A NAME="150"></A>to come and practise at home with him, being ambitious of having people 
<A NAME="151"></A>inquire after his house and frequent his company. When he came to the Olympic 
<A NAME="152"></A>games, and was so splendid in his equipage and entertainments, in his rich 
<A NAME="153"></A>tents and furniture, that he strove to outdo Cimon, he displeased the Greeks, 
<A NAME="154"></A>who thought that such magnificence might be allowed in one who was a young 
<A NAME="155"></A>man and of a great family, but was a great piece of insolence in one as 
<A NAME="156"></A>yet undistinguished, and without title or means for making any such display. 
<A NAME="157"></A>In a dramatic contest, the play he paid for won the price, which was then 
<A NAME="158"></A>a matter that excited much emulation; he put up a tablet in record of it, 
<A NAME="159"></A>with the inscription: "Themistocles of Phrearrhi was at the charge of it; 
<A NAME="160"></A>Phrynichus made it; Adimantus was archon." He was well liked by the common 
<A NAME="161"></A>people, would salute every particular citizen by his own name, and always 
<A NAME="162"></A>show himself a just judge in questions of business between private men; 
<A NAME="163"></A>he said to Simonides, the poet of Ceos, who desired something of him, when 
<A NAME="164"></A>he was commander of the army, that was not reasonable, "Simonides, you 
<A NAME="165"></A>would be no good poet if you wrote false measure, nor should I be a good 
<A NAME="166"></A>magistrate if for favour I made false law." and at another time, laughing 
<A NAME="167"></A>at Simonides, he said, that he was a man of little judgment to speak against 
<A NAME="168"></A>the Corinthians, who were inhabitants of a great city, and to have his 
<A NAME="169"></A>own picture drawn so often, having so ill-looking a 
<A NAME="170"></A>face.
<A NAME="171"></A><BR><BR>Gradually growing to be great, and winning the favour of the people, 
<A NAME="172"></A>he at last gained the day with his faction over that of Aristides, and 
<A NAME="173"></A>procured his banishment by ostracism. When the king of Persia was now advancing 
<A NAME="174"></A>against Greece, and the Athenians were in consultation who should be general, 
<A NAME="175"></A>and many withdrew themselves of their own accord, being terrified with 
<A NAME="176"></A>the greatness of the danger, there was one Epicydes, a popular speaker, 
<A NAME="177"></A>son to Euphemides a man of an elegant tongue, but of a faint heart, and 
<A NAME="178"></A>a slave to riches who was desirous of the command, and was looked upon 
<A NAME="179"></A>to be in a fair way to carry it by the number of votes; but Themistocles, 
<A NAME="180"></A>fearing that, if the command should fall into such hands, all would be 
<A NAME="181"></A>lost, bought off Epicydes and his pretensions, it is said, for a sum of 
<A NAME="182"></A>money.
<A NAME="183"></A><BR><BR>When the king of Persia sent messengers into Greece, with an interpreter, 
<A NAME="184"></A>to demand earth and water, as an acknowledgment of subjection, Themistocles, 
<A NAME="185"></A>by the consent of the people, seized upon the interpreter, and put him 
<A NAME="186"></A>to death, for presuming to publish the barbarian orders and decrees in 
<A NAME="187"></A>the Greek language; this is one of the actions he is commended for, as 
<A NAME="188"></A>also for what he did to Arthmius of Zelea, who brought gold from the king 
<A NAME="189"></A>of Persia to corrupt the Greeks, and was, by an order from Themistocles, 
<A NAME="190"></A>degraded and disfranchised, he and his children and his posterity; but 
<A NAME="191"></A>that which most of all redounded to his credit was, that he put an end 
<A NAME="192"></A>to all the civil wars of Greece, composed their differences, and persuaded 
<A NAME="193"></A>them to lay aside all enmity during the war with the Persians; and in this 
<A NAME="194"></A>great work, Chileus the Arcadian was, it is said, of great assistance to 
<A NAME="195"></A>him.
<A NAME="196"></A><BR><BR>Having taken upon himself the command of the Athenian forces, he 
<A NAME="197"></A>immediately endeavoured to persuade the citizens to leave the city, and 
<A NAME="198"></A>to embark upon their galleys, and meet with the Persians at a great distance 
<A NAME="199"></A>from Greece; but many being against this, he led a large force, together 
<A NAME="200"></A>with the Lacedaemonians, into Tempe, that in this pass they might maintain 
<A NAME="201"></A>the safety of Thessaly, which had not as yet declared for the king; but 
<A NAME="202"></A>when they returned without performing anything, and it was known that not 
<A NAME="203"></A>only the Thessalians, but all as far as Boeotia, was going over to Xerxes, 
<A NAME="204"></A>then the Athenians more willingly hearkened to the advice of Themistocles 
<A NAME="205"></A>to fight by sea, and sent him with a fleet to guard the straits of 
<A NAME="206"></A>Artemisium.
<A NAME="207"></A><BR><BR>When the contingents met here, the Greeks would have the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="208"></A>to command, and Eurybiades to be their admiral; but the Athenians, who 
<A NAME="209"></A>surpassed all the rest together in number of vessels, would not submit 
<A NAME="210"></A>to come after any other, till Themistocles, perceiving the danger of the 
<A NAME="211"></A>contest, yielded his own command to Eurybiades, and got the Athenians to 
<A NAME="212"></A>submit, extenuating the loss by persuading them, that if in this war they 
<A NAME="213"></A>behaved themselves like men, he would answer for it after that, that the 
<A NAME="214"></A>Greeks, of their own will, would submit to their command. And by this moderation 
<A NAME="215"></A>of his, it is evident that he was the chief means of the deliverance of 
<A NAME="216"></A>Greece, and gained the Athenians the glory of alike surpassing their enemies 
<A NAME="217"></A>in valour, and their confederates in wisdom.
<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR>As soon as the Persian armada arrived at Aphetae, Eurybiades was 
<A NAME="219"></A>astonished to see such a vast number of vessels before him, and being informed 
<A NAME="220"></A>that two hundred more were sailing around behind the island of Sciathus, 
<A NAME="221"></A>he immediately determined to retire farther into Greece, and to sail back 
<A NAME="222"></A>into some part of Peloponnesus, where their land army and their fleet might 
<A NAME="223"></A>join, for he looked upon the Persian forces to be altogether unassailable 
<A NAME="224"></A>by sea. But the Euboeans, fearing that the Greeks would forsake them, and 
<A NAME="225"></A>leave them to the mercy of the enemy, sent Pelagon to confer privately 
<A NAME="226"></A>with Themistocles, taking with him a good sum of money, which, as Herodotus 
<A NAME="227"></A>reports, he accepted and gave to Eurybiades. In this affair none of his 
<A NAME="228"></A>own countrymen opposed him so much as Architeles, captain of the sacred 
<A NAME="229"></A>galley, who, having no money to supply his seamen, was eager to go home; 
<A NAME="230"></A>but Themistocles so incensed the Athenians against them, that they set 
<A NAME="231"></A>upon him and left him not so much as his supper, at which Architeles was 
<A NAME="232"></A>much surprised, and took it very ill; but Themistocles immediately sent 
<A NAME="233"></A>him in a chest a service of provisions, and at the bottom of it a talent 
<A NAME="234"></A>of silver, desiring him to sup tonight, and to-morrow provide for his seamen; 
<A NAME="235"></A>if not, he would report it among the Athenians that he had received money 
<A NAME="236"></A>from the enemy. So Phanias the Lesbian tells the story.
<A NAME="237"></A><BR><BR>Though the fights between the Greeks and Persians in the straits 
<A NAME="238"></A>of Euboea were not so important as to make any final decision of the war, 
<A NAME="239"></A>yet the experience which the Greeks obtained in them was of great advantage; 
<A NAME="240"></A>for thus, by actual trial and in real danger, they found out that neither 
<A NAME="241"></A>number of ships, nor riches and ornaments, nor boasting shouts, nor barbarous 
<A NAME="242"></A>songs of victory, were any way terrible to men that knew how to fight, 
<A NAME="243"></A>and were resolved to come hand to hand with their enemies; these things 
<A NAME="244"></A>they were to despise, and to come up close and grapple with their foes. 
<A NAME="245"></A>This Pindar appears to have seen, and says justly enough of the fight at 
<A NAME="246"></A>Artemisium, that-
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR>"There the sons of Athens set
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>The stone that freedom stands on yet." For the first step towards victory 
<A NAME="249"></A>undoubtedly is to gain courage, Artemisium is in Euboea, beyond the city 
<A NAME="250"></A>of Histiaea, a sea-beach open to the north; most nearly opposite to it 
<A NAME="251"></A>stands Olizon, in the country which formally was under Philoctetes; there 
<A NAME="252"></A>is a small temple there, dedicated to Diana, surnamed of the Dawn, and 
<A NAME="253"></A>trees about it, around which again stand pillars of white marble; and if 
<A NAME="254"></A>you rub them with your hand, they send forth both the smell and colour 
<A NAME="255"></A>of saffron. On one of these pillars these verses are 
<A NAME="256"></A>engraved:-
<A NAME="257"></A><BR><BR>"With numerous tribes from Asia's region brought
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>The sons of Athens on these waters fought;
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>Erecting, after they had quelled the Mede,
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>To Artemis this record of the deed." There is a place still to be seen 
<A NAME="261"></A>upon this shore, where, in the middle of a great heap of sand, they take 
<A NAME="262"></A>out from the bottom a dark powder like ashes, or something that has passed 
<A NAME="263"></A>the fire; and here, it is supposed, the shipwrecks and bodies of the dead 
<A NAME="264"></A>were burnt.
<A NAME="265"></A><BR><BR>But when news came from Thermopylae to Artemisium informing them 
<A NAME="266"></A>that king Leonidas was slain, and that Xerxes had made himself master of 
<A NAME="267"></A>all the passages by land, they returned back to the interior of Greece, 
<A NAME="268"></A>the Athenians having the command of the rear, the place of honour and danger, 
<A NAME="269"></A>and much elated by what had been done.
<A NAME="270"></A><BR><BR>As Themistocles sailed along the coasts, he took notice of the 
<A NAME="271"></A>harbours and fit places for the enemy's ships to come to land at, and engraved 
<A NAME="272"></A>large letters in such stones as he found there by chance, as also in others 
<A NAME="273"></A>which he set up on purpose near to the landing-places, or where they were 
<A NAME="274"></A>to water; in which inscriptions he called upon the Ionians to forsake the 
<A NAME="275"></A>Medes, if it were possible, and to come over to the Greeks, who were their 
<A NAME="276"></A>proper founders and fathers, and were now hazarding all for their liberties; 
<A NAME="277"></A>but, if this could not be done, at any rate to impede and disturb the Persians 
<A NAME="278"></A>in all engagements. He hoped that these writings would prevail with the 
<A NAME="279"></A>Ionians to revolt, or raise some trouble by making their fidelity doubtful 
<A NAME="280"></A>to the Persians.
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR>Now, though Xerxes has already passed through Doris and invaded 
<A NAME="282"></A>the country of Phocis, and was burning and destroying the cities of the 
<A NAME="283"></A>Phocians, yet the Greeks sent them no relief; and, though the Athenians 
<A NAME="284"></A>earnestly desired them to meet the Persians in Boeotia, before they could 
<A NAME="285"></A>come into Attica, as they themselves had come forward by sea at Artemisium, 
<A NAME="286"></A>they gave no ear to their requests, being wholly intent upon Peloponnesus, 
<A NAME="287"></A>and resolved to gather all their forces together within the Isthmus, and 
<A NAME="288"></A>to build a wall from sea to sea in that narrow neck of land; so that the 
<A NAME="289"></A>Athenians were enraged to see themselves betrayed, and at the same time 
<A NAME="290"></A>afflicted and dejected at their own destitution. For to fight alone against 
<A NAME="291"></A>such a numerous army was to no purpose, and the only expedient now left 
<A NAME="292"></A>them was to leave their city and cling to their ships; which the people 
<A NAME="293"></A>were very unwilling to submit to, imagining that it would signify little 
<A NAME="294"></A>now to gain a victory, and not understanding how there could be deliverance 
<A NAME="295"></A>any longer after they had once forsaken the temples of their gods and exposed 
<A NAME="296"></A>the tombs and monuments of their ancestors to the fury of their 
<A NAME="297"></A>enemies.
<A NAME="298"></A><BR><BR>Themistocles, being at a loss, and not able to draw the people 
<A NAME="299"></A>over to his opinion by any human reason, set his machines to work, as in 
<A NAME="300"></A>a theatre, and employed prodigies and oracles. The serpent of Minerva, 
<A NAME="301"></A>kept in the inner part of her temple, disappeared; the priest gave it out 
<A NAME="302"></A>to the people that the offerings which were set for it were found untouched, 
<A NAME="303"></A>and declared, by the suggestion of Themistocles, that the goddess had left 
<A NAME="304"></A>the city, and taken her flight before them towards the sea. And he often 
<A NAME="305"></A>urged them with the oracle which bade them trust to walls of wood, showing 
<A NAME="306"></A>them that walls of wood could signify nothing else but ships- and that 
<A NAME="307"></A>the island of Salamis was termed in it, not miserable or unhappy, but had 
<A NAME="308"></A>the epithet of divine, for that it should one day be associated with a 
<A NAME="309"></A>great good fortune of the Greeks. At length his opinion prevailed, and 
<A NAME="310"></A>he obtained a decree that the city should be committed to the protection 
<A NAME="311"></A>of Minerva, "Queen of Athens;" that they who were of age to bear arms should 
<A NAME="312"></A>embark, and that each should see to sending away his children, women, and 
<A NAME="313"></A>slaves where he could. This decree being confirmed, most of the Athenians 
<A NAME="314"></A>removed their parents, wives, and children to Troezen, where they were 
<A NAME="315"></A>received with eager good-will by the Troezenians, who passed a vote that 
<A NAME="316"></A>they should be maintained at the public charge, by a daily payment of two 
<A NAME="317"></A>obols to every one, and leave be given to the children to gather fruit 
<A NAME="318"></A>where they pleased, and schoolmasters paid to instruct them. This vote 
<A NAME="319"></A>was proposed by Nicagoras.
<A NAME="320"></A><BR><BR>There was no public treasure at that time in Athens; but the council 
<A NAME="321"></A>of Areopagus, as Aristotle says, distributed to every one that served eight 
<A NAME="322"></A>drachmas, which was a great help to the manning of the fleet; but Clidemus 
<A NAME="323"></A>ascribes this also to the art of Themistocles. When the Athenians were 
<A NAME="324"></A>on their way down to the haven of Piraeus, the shield with the head of 
<A NAME="325"></A>Medusa was missing; and be, under the pretext of searching for it, ransacked 
<A NAME="326"></A>all places, and found among their goods considerable sums of money concealed, 
<A NAME="327"></A>which he applied to the public use; and with this the soldiers and seamen 
<A NAME="328"></A>were well provided for their voyage.
<A NAME="329"></A><BR><BR>When the whole city of Athens were going on board, it afforded 
<A NAME="330"></A>a spectacle worthy alike of pity and admiration, to see them thus send 
<A NAME="331"></A>away their fathers and children before them, and, unmoved with their cries 
<A NAME="332"></A>and tears, passed over into the island. But that which stirred compassion 
<A NAME="333"></A>most of all was, that many old men, by reason of their great age, were 
<A NAME="334"></A>left behind; and even the tame domestic animals could not be seen without 
<A NAME="335"></A>some pity, running about the town and howling, as desirous to be carried 
<A NAME="336"></A>along with their masters that had kept them; among which it is reported 
<A NAME="337"></A>that Xanthippus, the father of Pericles, had a dog that would not endure 
<A NAME="338"></A>to stay behind, but leaped into the sea, and swam along by the galley's 
<A NAME="339"></A>side till he came to the island of Salamis, where he fainted away and died, 
<A NAME="340"></A>and that spot in the island, which is still called the Dog's Grave, is 
<A NAME="341"></A>said to be his.
<A NAME="342"></A><BR><BR>Among the great actions of Themistocles at this crisis, the recall 
<A NAME="343"></A>of Aristides was not the least, for, before the war, he had been ostracized 
<A NAME="344"></A>by the party which Themistocles headed, and was in banishment; but now, 
<A NAME="345"></A>perceiving that the people regretted his absence, and were fearful that 
<A NAME="346"></A>he might go over to the Persians to revenge himself, and thereby ruin the 
<A NAME="347"></A>affairs of Greece, Themistocles proposed a decree that those who were banished 
<A NAME="348"></A>for a time might return again, to give assistance by word and deed to the 
<A NAME="349"></A>cause of Greece with the rest of their fellow-citizens.
<A NAME="350"></A><BR><BR>Eurybiades, by reason of the greatness of Sparta, was admiral of 
<A NAME="351"></A>the Greek fleet, but yet was faint-hearted in time of danger, and willing 
<A NAME="352"></A>to weigh anchor and set sail for the isthmus of Corinth, near which the 
<A NAME="353"></A>land army lay encamped; which Themistocles resisted; and this was the occasion 
<A NAME="354"></A>of the well-known words, when Eurybiades, to check his impatience, told 
<A NAME="355"></A>him that at the Olympic games they that start up before the rest are lashed; 
<A NAME="356"></A>"And they," replied Themistocles, "that are left behind are not crowned." 
<A NAME="357"></A>Again, Eurybiades lifting up his staff as if he were going to strike, Themistocles 
<A NAME="358"></A>said, "Strike if you will, but hear;" Eurybiades, wondering much at his 
<A NAME="359"></A>moderation, desired him to speak, and Themistocles now brought him to a 
<A NAME="360"></A>better understanding. And when one who stood by him told him that it did 
<A NAME="361"></A>not become those who had neither city nor house to lose, to persuade others 
<A NAME="362"></A>to relinquish their habitations and forsake their countries, Themistocles 
<A NAME="363"></A>gave this reply: "We have indeed left our houses and our walls, base fellow, 
<A NAME="364"></A>not thinking it fit to become slaves for the sake of things that have no 
<A NAME="365"></A>life nor soul; and yet our city is the greatest of all Greece, consisting 
<A NAME="366"></A>of two hundred galleys, which are here to defend you, if you please; but 
<A NAME="367"></A>if you run away and betray us, as you did once before, the Greeks shall 
<A NAME="368"></A>soon hear news of the Athenians possessing as fair a country, and as large 
<A NAME="369"></A>and free a city, as that they have lost." These expressions of Themistocles 
<A NAME="370"></A>made Eurybiades suspect that if he retreated the Athenians would fall off 
<A NAME="371"></A>from him. When one of Eretria began to oppose him, he said, "Have you anything 
<A NAME="372"></A>to say of war, that are like an inkfish? you have a sword, but no heart." 
<A NAME="373"></A>Some say that while Themistocles was thus speaking upon the deck, an owl 
<A NAME="374"></A>was seen flying to the right hand of the fleet, which came and sate upon 
<A NAME="375"></A>the top of the mast; and this happy omen so far disposed the Greeks to 
<A NAME="376"></A>follow his advice, that they presently prepared to fight. Yet, when the 
<A NAME="377"></A>enemy's fleet was arrived at the haven of Phalerum, upon the coast of Attica, 
<A NAME="378"></A>and with the number of their ships concealed all the shore, and when they 
<A NAME="379"></A>saw the king himself in person come down with his land army to the seaside, 
<A NAME="380"></A>with all his forces united, then the good counsel of Themistocles was soon 
<A NAME="381"></A>forgotten, and the Peloponnesians cast their eyes again towards the isthmus, 
<A NAME="382"></A>and took it very ill if any one spoke against their returning home; and, 
<A NAME="383"></A>resolving to depart that night, the pilots had orders what course to 
<A NAME="384"></A>steer.
<A NAME="385"></A><BR><BR>Themistocles, in great distress that the Greeks should retire, 
<A NAME="386"></A>and lose the advantage of the narrow seas and strait passage, and slip 
<A NAME="387"></A>home every one to his own city, considered with himself, and contrived 
<A NAME="388"></A>that stratagem that was carried out by Sicinnus. This Sicinnus was a Persian 
<A NAME="389"></A>captive, but a great lover of Themistocles, and the attendant of his children. 
<A NAME="390"></A>Upon this occasion, he sent him privately to Xerxes, commanding him to 
<A NAME="391"></A>tell the king that Themistocles, the admiral of the Athenians, having espoused 
<A NAME="392"></A>his interest, wished to be the first to inform him that the Greeks were 
<A NAME="393"></A>ready to make their escape, and that he counselled him to hinder their 
<A NAME="394"></A>flight, to set upon them while they were in this confusion and at a distance 
<A NAME="395"></A>from their land army, and hereby destroy all their forces by sea. Xerxes 
<A NAME="396"></A>was very joyful at this message, and received it as from one who wished 
<A NAME="397"></A>him all that was good, and immediately issued instructions to the commanders 
<A NAME="398"></A>of his ships, that they should instantly set out with two hundred galleys 
<A NAME="399"></A>to encompass all the islands, and enclose all the straits and passages, 
<A NAME="400"></A>that none of the Greeks might escape, and that they should afterwards follow 
<A NAME="401"></A>with the rest of their fleet at leisure. This being done, Aristides, the 
<A NAME="402"></A>son of Lysimachus, was the first man that perceived it, and went to the 
<A NAME="403"></A>tent of Themistocles, not out of any friendship, for he had been formerly 
<A NAME="404"></A>banished by his means, as has been related, but to inform him how they 
<A NAME="405"></A>were encompassed by their enemies. Themistocles, knowing the generosity 
<A NAME="406"></A>of Aristides, and much struck by his visit at that time, imparted to him 
<A NAME="407"></A>all that he had transacted by Sicinnus, and entreated him that, as he would 
<A NAME="408"></A>be more readily believed among the Greeks, he would make use of his credit 
<A NAME="409"></A>to help to induce them to stay and fight their enemies in the narrow seas. 
<A NAME="410"></A>Aristides applauded Themistocles, and went to the other commanders and 
<A NAME="411"></A>captains of the galleys, and encouraged them to engage; yet they did not 
<A NAME="412"></A>perfectly assent to him, till a galley of Tenos, which deserted from the 
<A NAME="413"></A>Persians, of which Panaetius was commander, came in, while they were still 
<A NAME="414"></A>doubting, and confirmed the news that all the straits and passages were 
<A NAME="415"></A>beset; and then their rage and fury, as well as their necessity, provoked 
<A NAME="416"></A>them all to fight.
<A NAME="417"></A><BR><BR>As soon as it was day, Xerxes placed himself high up, to view his 
<A NAME="418"></A>fleet, and how it was set in order. Phanodemus says, he sat upon a promontory 
<A NAME="419"></A>above the temple of Hercules, where the coast of Attica is separated from 
<A NAME="420"></A>the island by a narrow channel; but Acestodorus writes, that it was in 
<A NAME="421"></A>the confines of Megara, upon those hills which are called the Horns, where 
<A NAME="422"></A>he sat in a chair of gold, with many secretaries about him to write down 
<A NAME="423"></A>all that was done in the fight.
<A NAME="424"></A><BR><BR>When Themistocles was about to sacrifice, close to the admiral's 
<A NAME="425"></A>galley, there were three prisoners brought to him, fine looking men, and 
<A NAME="426"></A>richly dressed in ornamented clothing and gold, said to be the children 
<A NAME="427"></A>of Artayctes and Sandauce, sister to Xerxes. As soon as the prophet Euphrantides 
<A NAME="428"></A>saw them, and observed that at the same time the fire blazed out from the 
<A NAME="429"></A>offerings with a more than ordinary flame, and a man sneezed on the right, 
<A NAME="430"></A>which was an intimation of a fortunate event, he took Themistocles by the 
<A NAME="431"></A>hand, and bade him consecrate the three young men for sacrifice, and offer 
<A NAME="432"></A>them up with prayers for victory to Bacchus the Devourer; so should the 
<A NAME="433"></A>Greeks not only save themselves, but also obtain victory. Themistocles 
<A NAME="434"></A>was much disturbed at this strange and terrible prophecy, but the common 
<A NAME="435"></A>people, who in any difficult crisis and great exigency ever look for relief 
<A NAME="436"></A>rather to strange and extravagant than to reasonable means, calling upon 
<A NAME="437"></A>Bacchus with one voice, led the captives to the altar, and compelled the 
<A NAME="438"></A>execution of the sacrifice as the prophet had commanded. This is reported 
<A NAME="439"></A>by Phanias the Lesbian, a philosopher well read in history.
<A NAME="440"></A><BR><BR>The number of the enemy's ships the poet Aeschylus gives in his 
<A NAME="441"></A>tragedy called the Persians, as on his certain knowledge, in the following 
<A NAME="442"></A>words:-
<A NAME="443"></A><BR><BR>"Xerxes, I know, did into battle lead
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>One thousand ships; of more than usual speed
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>Seven and two hundred. So it is agreed."
<A NAME="446"></A><BR><BR>The Athenians had a hundred and eighty; in every ship eighteen 
<A NAME="447"></A>men fought upon the deck, four of whom were archers and the rest men at 
<A NAME="448"></A>arms.
<A NAME="449"></A><BR><BR>As Themistocles had fixed upon the most advantageous place, so, 
<A NAME="450"></A>with no less sagacity, he chose the best time of fighting; for he would 
<A NAME="451"></A>not run the prows of his galleys against the Persians, nor begin the fight 
<A NAME="452"></A>till the time of day was come, when there regularly blows in a fresh breeze 
<A NAME="453"></A>from the open sea, and brings in with it a strong swell into the channel; 
<A NAME="454"></A>which was no inconvenience to the Greek ships, which were low-built, and 
<A NAME="455"></A>little above the water, but did much to hurt the Persians, which had high 
<A NAME="456"></A>sterns and lofty decks, and were heavy and cumbrous in their movements 
<A NAME="457"></A>as it presented them broadside to the quick charges of the Greeks, who 
<A NAME="458"></A>kept their eyes upon the motions of Themistocles, as their best example, 
<A NAME="459"></A>and more particularly because, opposed to his ship, Ariamenes, admiral 
<A NAME="460"></A>to Xerxes, a brave man and by far the best and worthiest of the king's 
<A NAME="461"></A>brothers, was seen throwing darts and shooting arrows from his huge galley, 
<A NAME="462"></A>as from the walls of a castle. Aminias the Decelean and Sosicles the Pedian, 
<A NAME="463"></A>who sailed in the same vessel, upon the ships meeting stem to stem, and 
<A NAME="464"></A>transfixing each the other with their brazen prows, so that they were fastened 
<A NAME="465"></A>together, when Ariamenes attempted to board theirs, ran at him with their 
<A NAME="466"></A>pikes, and thrust him into the sea; his body, as it floated amongst other 
<A NAME="467"></A>shipwrecks, was known to Artemisia, and carried to Xerxes.
<A NAME="468"></A><BR><BR>It is reported that, in the middle of the fight, a great flame 
<A NAME="469"></A>rose into the air above the city of Eleusis, and that sounds and voices 
<A NAME="470"></A>were heard through all the Thriasian plain, as far as the sea, sounding 
<A NAME="471"></A>like a number of men accompanying and escorting the mystic Iacchus, and 
<A NAME="472"></A>that a mist seemed to form and rise from the place from whence the sounds 
<A NAME="473"></A>came, and, passing forward, fell upon the galleys. Others believed that 
<A NAME="474"></A>they saw apparitions, in the shape of armed men, reaching out their hands 
<A NAME="475"></A>from the island of Aegina before the Grecian galleys; and supposed they 
<A NAME="476"></A>were the Aeacidae, whom they had invoked to their aid before the battle. 
<A NAME="477"></A>The first man that took a ship was Lycomedes the Athenian, captain of the 
<A NAME="478"></A>galley, who cut down its ensign, and dedicated it to Apollo the Laurel-crowned. 
<A NAME="479"></A>And as the Persians fought in a narrow arm of the sea, and could bring 
<A NAME="480"></A>but part of their fleet to fight and fell foul of one another, the Greeks 
<A NAME="481"></A>thus equalled them in strength, and fought with them till the evening forced 
<A NAME="482"></A>them back, and obtained, as says Simonides, that noble and famous victory, 
<A NAME="483"></A>than which neither amongst the Greeks nor barbarians was ever known more 
<A NAME="484"></A>glorious exploit on the seas; by the joint valour, indeed, and zeal of 
<A NAME="485"></A>all who fought, but by the wisdom and sagacity of Themistocles.
<A NAME="486"></A><BR><BR>After this sea-fight, Xerxes, enraged at his ill-fortune, attempted, 
<A NAME="487"></A>by casting great heaps of earth and stones into the sea, to stop up the 
<A NAME="488"></A>channel and make a dam, upon which he might lead his land-forces over into 
<A NAME="489"></A>the island of Salamis.
<A NAME="490"></A><BR><BR>Themistocles, being desirous to try the opinion of Aristides, told 
<A NAME="491"></A>him that he proposed to set sail for the Hellespont, to break the bridge 
<A NAME="492"></A>of ships so as to shut up, he said, Asia a prisoner within Europe; but 
<A NAME="493"></A>Aristides, disliking the design, said: "We have hitherto fought with an 
<A NAME="494"></A>enemy who has regarded little else but his pleasure and luxury; but if 
<A NAME="495"></A>we shut him up within Greece, and drive him to necessity, he that is master 
<A NAME="496"></A>of such great forces will no longer sit quietly with an umbrella of gold 
<A NAME="497"></A>over his head, looking upon the fight for his pleasure; but in such a strait 
<A NAME="498"></A>will attempt all things; he will be resolute, and appear himself in person 
<A NAME="499"></A>upon all occasions, he will soon correct his errors, and supply what he 
<A NAME="500"></A>has formerly omitted through remissness, and will be better advised in 
<A NAME="501"></A>all things. Therefore, it is noways our interest, Themistocles," he said, 
<A NAME="502"></A>"to take away the bridge that is already made, but rather to build another, 
<A NAME="503"></A>if it were possible, that he might make his retreat with the more expedition." 
<A NAME="504"></A>To which Themistocles answered: "If this be requisite, we must immediately 
<A NAME="505"></A>use all diligence, art, and industry, to rid ourselves of him as soon as 
<A NAME="506"></A>may be;" and to this purpose he found out among the captives one of the 
<A NAME="507"></A>King of Persia's eunuchs, named Arnaces, whom he sent to the king, to inform 
<A NAME="508"></A>him that the Greeks, being now victorious by sea, had decreed to sail to 
<A NAME="509"></A>the Hellespont, where the boats were fastened together, and destroy the 
<A NAME="510"></A>bridge; but that Themistocles, being concerned for the king, revealed this 
<A NAME="511"></A>to him, that he might hasten towards the Asiatic seas, and pass over into 
<A NAME="512"></A>his own dominions; and in the meantime would cause delays and hinder the 
<A NAME="513"></A>confederates from pursuing him. Xerxes no sooner heard this, but, being 
<A NAME="514"></A>very much terrified, he proceeded to retreat out of Greece with all speed. 
<A NAME="515"></A>The prudence of Themistocles and Aristides in this was afterwards more 
<A NAME="516"></A>fully understood at the battle of Plataea, where Mardonius, with a very 
<A NAME="517"></A>small fraction of the forces of Xerxes, put the Greeks in danger of losing 
<A NAME="518"></A>all.
<A NAME="519"></A><BR><BR>Herodotus writes, that of all the cities of Greece, Aegina was 
<A NAME="520"></A>held to have performed the best service in the war; while all single men 
<A NAME="521"></A>yielded to Themistocles, though, out of envy, unwillingly; and when they 
<A NAME="522"></A>returned to the entrance of Peloponnesus, where the several commanders 
<A NAME="523"></A>delivered their suffrages at the altar, to determine who was most worthy, 
<A NAME="524"></A>every one gave the first vote for himself and the second for Themistocles. 
<A NAME="525"></A>The Lacedaemonians carried him with them to Sparta, where, giving the rewards 
<A NAME="526"></A>of valour to Eurybiades, and of wisdom and conduct to Themistocles, they 
<A NAME="527"></A>crowned him with olive, presented him with the best chariot in the city, 
<A NAME="528"></A>and sent three hundred young men to accompany him to the confines of their 
<A NAME="529"></A>country. And at the next Olympic games, when Themistocles entered the course, 
<A NAME="530"></A>the spectators took no farther notice of those who were contesting the 
<A NAME="531"></A>prizes, but spent the whole day in looking upon him, showing him to the 
<A NAME="532"></A>strangers, admiring him, and applauding him by clapping their hands, and 
<A NAME="533"></A>other expressions of joy, so that he himself, much gratified, confessed 
<A NAME="534"></A>to his friends that he then reaped the fruit of all his labours for the 
<A NAME="535"></A>Greeks.
<A NAME="536"></A><BR><BR>He was, indeed, by nature, a great lover of honour, as is evident 
<A NAME="537"></A>from the anecdotes recorded of him. When chosen admiral by the Athenians, 
<A NAME="538"></A>he would not quite conclude any single matter of business, either public 
<A NAME="539"></A>or private, but deferred all till the day they were to set sail, that, 
<A NAME="540"></A>by despatching a great quantity of business all at once, and having to 
<A NAME="541"></A>meet a great variety of people, he might make an appearance of greatness 
<A NAME="542"></A>and power. Viewing the dead bodies cast up by the sea, he perceived bracelets 
<A NAME="543"></A>and necklaces of gold about them, yet passed on, only showing them to a 
<A NAME="544"></A>friend that followed him, saying, "Take you these things, for you are not 
<A NAME="545"></A>Themistocles." He said to Antiphates, a handsome young man, who had formerly 
<A NAME="546"></A>avoided, but now in his glory courted him, "Time, young man, has taught 
<A NAME="547"></A>us both a lesson." He said that the Athenians did not honour him or admire 
<A NAME="548"></A>him, but made, as it were, a sort of plane-tree of him; sheltered themselves 
<A NAME="549"></A>under him in bad weather, and as soon as it was fine, plucked his leaves 
<A NAME="550"></A>and cut his branches. When the Seriphian told him that he had not obtained 
<A NAME="551"></A>this honour by himself, but by the greatness of the city, he replied, "You 
<A NAME="552"></A>speak truth; I should never have been famous if I had been of Seriphus; 
<A NAME="553"></A>nor you, had you been of Athens." When another of the generals, who thought 
<A NAME="554"></A>he had performed considerable service for the Athenians, boastingly compared 
<A NAME="555"></A>his action with those of Themistocles, he told him that once upon a time 
<A NAME="556"></A>the Day after the Festival found fault with the Festival: "On you there 
<A NAME="557"></A>is nothing but hurry and trouble and preparation, but, when I come, everybody 
<A NAME="558"></A>sits down quietly and enjoys himself;" which the Festival admitted was 
<A NAME="559"></A>true, but "if I had not come first, you would not have come at all." "Even 
<A NAME="560"></A>so," he said, "if Themistocles had not come before, where had you been 
<A NAME="561"></A>now?" Laughing at his own son, who got his mother, and, by his mother's 
<A NAME="562"></A>means, his father also, to indulge him, he told him that he had the most 
<A NAME="563"></A>power of any one in Greece: "For the Athenians command the rest of Greece, 
<A NAME="564"></A>I command the Athenians, your mother commands me, and you command your 
<A NAME="565"></A>mother." Loving to be singular in all things, when he had land to sell, 
<A NAME="566"></A>he ordered the crier to give notice that there were good neighbours near 
<A NAME="567"></A>it. Of two who made love to his daughter, he preferred the man of worth 
<A NAME="568"></A>to the one who was rich, saying he desired a man without riches, rather 
<A NAME="569"></A>than riches without a man. Such was the character of his 
<A NAME="570"></A>sayings.
<A NAME="571"></A><BR><BR>After these things, he began to rebuild and fortify the city of 
<A NAME="572"></A>Athens, bribing, as Theopompus reports, the Lacedaemonian ephors not to 
<A NAME="573"></A>be against it, but, as most relate it, overreaching and deceiving them. 
<A NAME="574"></A>For, under the pretext of an embassy, he went to Sparta, whereupon the 
<A NAME="575"></A>Lacedaemonians' charging him with rebuilding the walls, and Poliarchus 
<A NAME="576"></A>coming on purpose from Aegina to denounce it, he denied the fact, bidding 
<A NAME="577"></A>them to send people to Athens to see whether it were so or no; by which 
<A NAME="578"></A>delay he got time for the building of the wall, and also placed these ambassadors 
<A NAME="579"></A>in the hands of his countrymen as hostages for him; and so, when the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="580"></A>knew the truth, they did him no hurt, but, suppressing all display of their 
<A NAME="581"></A>anger for the present, sent him away.
<A NAME="582"></A><BR><BR>Next he proceeded to establish the harbour of Piraeus, observing 
<A NAME="583"></A>the great natural advantages of the locality, and desirous to unite the 
<A NAME="584"></A>whole city with the sea, and to reverse, in a manner, the policy of ancient 
<A NAME="585"></A>Athenian kings, who, endeavouring to withdraw their subjects from the sea, 
<A NAME="586"></A>and to accustom them to live, not by sailing about, but by planting and 
<A NAME="587"></A>tilling the earth, spread the story of the dispute between Minerva and 
<A NAME="588"></A>Neptune for the sovereignty of Athens, in which Minerva, by producing to 
<A NAME="589"></A>the judges an olive-tree, was declared to have won; whereas Themistocles 
<A NAME="590"></A>did not only knead up, as Aristophanes says, the port and the city into 
<A NAME="591"></A>one, but made the city absolutely the dependant and the adjunct of the 
<A NAME="592"></A>port, and the land of the sea, which increased the power and confidence 
<A NAME="593"></A>of the people against the nobility; the authority coming into the hands 
<A NAME="594"></A>of sailors and boatswains and pilots. Thus it was one of the orders of 
<A NAME="595"></A>the thirty tyrants, that the hustings in the assembly, which had faced 
<A NAME="596"></A>towards the sea, should be turned round towards the land; implying their 
<A NAME="597"></A>opinion that the empire by sea had been the origin of the democracy, and 
<A NAME="598"></A>that the farming population were not so much opposed to 
<A NAME="599"></A>oligarchy.
<A NAME="600"></A><BR><BR>Themistocles, however, formed yet higher designs with a view to 
<A NAME="601"></A>naval supremacy. For, after the departure of Xerxes, when the Grecian fleet 
<A NAME="602"></A>was arrived at Pagasae, where they wintered, Themistocles, in a public 
<A NAME="603"></A>oration to the people of Athens, told them that he had a design to perform 
<A NAME="604"></A>something that would tend greatly to their interests and safety, but was 
<A NAME="605"></A>of such a nature that it could not be made generally public. The Athenians 
<A NAME="606"></A>ordered him to impart it to Aristides only; and, if he approved of it, 
<A NAME="607"></A>to put it in practice. And when Themistocles had discovered to him that 
<A NAME="608"></A>his design was to burn the Grecian fleet in the haven of Pagasae, Aristides 
<A NAME="609"></A>coming out to the people, gave this report of the stratagem contrived by 
<A NAME="610"></A>Themistocles, that no proposal could be more politic, or more dishonourable; 
<A NAME="611"></A>on which the Athenians commanded Themistocles to think no farther of 
<A NAME="612"></A>it.
<A NAME="613"></A><BR><BR>When the Lacedaemonians proposed, at the general council of the 
<A NAME="614"></A>Amphictyonians, that the representatives of those cities which were not 
<A NAME="615"></A>in the league, nor had fought against the Persians, should be excluded, 
<A NAME="616"></A>Themistocles, fearing that the Thessalians, with those of Thebes, Argos, 
<A NAME="617"></A>and others, being thrown out of the council, the Lacedaemonians would become 
<A NAME="618"></A>wholly masters of the votes, and do what they pleased, supported the deputies 
<A NAME="619"></A>of the cities, and prevailed with the members then sitting to alter their 
<A NAME="620"></A>opinion on this point, showing them that there were but one-and-thirty 
<A NAME="621"></A>cities which had partaken in the war, and that most of these, also, were 
<A NAME="622"></A>very small; how intolerable would it be, if the rest of Greece should be 
<A NAME="623"></A>excluded, and the general council should come to be ruled by two or three 
<A NAME="624"></A>great cities. By this, chiefly, he incurred the displeasure of the Lacedaemonians, 
<A NAME="625"></A>whose honours and favours were now shown to Cimon, with a view to making 
<A NAME="626"></A>him the opponent of the state policy of Themistocles.
<A NAME="627"></A><BR><BR>He was also burdensome to the confederates, sailing about the islands 
<A NAME="628"></A>and collecting money from them. Herodotus says, that, requiring money of 
<A NAME="629"></A>those of the island of Andros, he told them that he had brought with him 
<A NAME="630"></A>two goddesses, Persuasion and Force; and they answered him that they had 
<A NAME="631"></A>also two great goddesses, which prohibited them from giving him any money, 
<A NAME="632"></A>Poverty and Impossibility. Timocreon, the Rhodian poet, reprehends him 
<A NAME="633"></A>somewhat bitterly for being wrought upon by money to let some who were 
<A NAME="634"></A>banished return, while abandoning himself, who was his guest and friend. 
<A NAME="635"></A>The verses are these:-
<A NAME="636"></A><BR><BR>"Pausanias you may praise, and Xanthippus, he be 
<A NAME="637"></A>for,
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>For Leutychidas, a third; Aristides, I proclaim,
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>From the sacred Athens came.
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>The one true man of all; for Themistocles Latona doth 
<A NAME="641"></A>abhor,
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>The liar, traitor, cheat, who to gain his filthy 
<A NAME="643"></A>pay,
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>Timocreon, his friend, neglected to restore
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>To his native Rhodian shore;
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>Three silver talents took and departed (curses with him) on 
<A NAME="647"></A>his
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>way,
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>Restoring people here, expelling there, and killing 
<A NAME="650"></A>here,
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>Filling evermore his purse: and at the Isthmus gave a 
<A NAME="652"></A>treat,
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>To be laughed at, of cold meat,
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>Which they ate, and prayed the gods some one else 
<A NAME="655"></A>might
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>give the feast another year." But after the sentence and banishment 
<A NAME="657"></A>of Themistocles, Timocreon reviles him yet more immoderately and wildly 
<A NAME="658"></A>in a poem that begins thus:-
<A NAME="659"></A><BR><BR>"Unto all the Greeks repair,
<A NAME="660"></A><BR>O Muse, and tell these verses there,
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>As is fitting and is fair." The story is, that it was put to the question 
<A NAME="662"></A>whether Timocreon should be banished for siding with the Persians, and 
<A NAME="663"></A>Themistocles gave his vote against him. So when Themistocles was accused 
<A NAME="664"></A>of intriguing with the Medes, Timocreon made these lines upon 
<A NAME="665"></A>him:-
<A NAME="666"></A><BR><BR>"So now Timocreon, indeed, is not the sole friend of the 
<A NAME="667"></A>Mede,
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>There are some knaves besides; nor is it only mine that 
<A NAME="669"></A>fails,
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>But other foxes have lost tails.-" When the citizens of Athens began 
<A NAME="671"></A>to listen willingly to those who traduced and reproached him, he was forced, 
<A NAME="672"></A>with somewhat obnoxious frequency, to put them in mind of the great services 
<A NAME="673"></A>he had performed, and ask those who were offended with him whether they 
<A NAME="674"></A>were weary with receiving benefits often from the same person, so rendering 
<A NAME="675"></A>himself more odious. And he yet more provoked the people by building a 
<A NAME="676"></A>temple to Diana with the epithet of Aristobule, or Diana of Best Counsel; 
<A NAME="677"></A>intimating thereby, that he had given the best counsel, not only to the 
<A NAME="678"></A>Athenians, but to all Greece. He built this temple near his own house, 
<A NAME="679"></A>in the district called Melite, where now the public officers carry out 
<A NAME="680"></A>the bodies of such as are executed, and throw the halters and clothes of 
<A NAME="681"></A>those that are strangled or otherwise put to death. There is to this day 
<A NAME="682"></A>a small figure of Themistocles in the temple of Diana of Best Counsel, 
<A NAME="683"></A>which represents him to be a person not only of a noble mind, but also 
<A NAME="684"></A>of a most heroic aspect. At length the Athenians banished him, making use 
<A NAME="685"></A>of the ostracism to humble his eminence and authority, as they ordinarily 
<A NAME="686"></A>did with all whom they thought too powerful, or, by their greatness, disproportional 
<A NAME="687"></A>to the equality thought requisite in a popular government. For the ostracism 
<A NAME="688"></A>was instituted, not so much to punish the offender, as to mitigate and 
<A NAME="689"></A>pacify the violence of the envious, who delighted to humble eminent men, 
<A NAME="690"></A>and who, by fixing this disgrace upon them, might vent some part of their 
<A NAME="691"></A>rancour.
<A NAME="692"></A><BR><BR>Themistocles being banished from Athens, while he stayed at Argos 
<A NAME="693"></A>the detection of Pausanias happened, which gave such advantage to his enemies, 
<A NAME="694"></A>that Leobotes of Agraule, son of Alcmaeon, indicted him of treason, the 
<A NAME="695"></A>Spartans supporting him in the accusation.
<A NAME="696"></A><BR><BR>When Pausanias went about this treasonable design, he concealed 
<A NAME="697"></A>it at first from Themistocles, though he were his intimate friend; but 
<A NAME="698"></A>when he saw him expelled out of the commonwealth, and how impatiently he 
<A NAME="699"></A>took his banishment, he ventured to communicate it to him, and desired 
<A NAME="700"></A>his assistance, showing him the king of Persia's letters, and exasperating 
<A NAME="701"></A>him against the Greeks, as a villainous, ungrateful people. However, Themistocles 
<A NAME="702"></A>immediately rejected the proposals of Pausanias, and wholly refused to 
<A NAME="703"></A>be a party in the enterprise, though he never revealed his communications, 
<A NAME="704"></A>nor disclosed the conspiracy to any man, either hoping that Pausanias would 
<A NAME="705"></A>desist from his intentions, or expecting that so inconsiderate an attempt 
<A NAME="706"></A>after such chimerical objects would be discovered by other 
<A NAME="707"></A>means.
<A NAME="708"></A><BR><BR>After that Pausanias was put to death, letters and writings being 
<A NAME="709"></A>found concerning this matter, which rendered Themistocles suspected, the 
<A NAME="710"></A>Lacedaemonians were clamorous against him, and his enemies among the Athenians 
<A NAME="711"></A>accused him; when, being absent from Athens, he made his defence by letters, 
<A NAME="712"></A>especially against the points that had been previously alleged against 
<A NAME="713"></A>him. In answer to the malicious detractions of his enemies, he merely wrote 
<A NAME="714"></A>to the citizens, urging that he who was always ambitious to govern, and 
<A NAME="715"></A>not of a character or a disposition to serve, would never sell himself 
<A NAME="716"></A>and his country into slavery to a barbarous and hostile 
<A NAME="717"></A>nation.
<A NAME="718"></A><BR><BR>Notwithstanding this, the people, being persuaded by his accusers, 
<A NAME="719"></A>sent officers to take him and bring him away to be tried before a council 
<A NAME="720"></A>of the Greeks, but, having timely notice of it, he passed over into the 
<A NAME="721"></A>island of Corcyra, where the state was under obligations to him; for, being 
<A NAME="722"></A>chosen as arbitrator in a difference between them and the Corinthians, 
<A NAME="723"></A>he decided the controversy by ordering the Corinthians to pay down twenty 
<A NAME="724"></A>talents, and declaring the town and island of Leucas a joint colony from 
<A NAME="725"></A>both cities. From thence he fled into Epirus, and, the Athenians and Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="726"></A>still pursuing him, he threw himself upon chances of safety that seemed 
<A NAME="727"></A>all but desperate. For he fled for refuge to Admetus, king of the Molossians, 
<A NAME="728"></A>who had formerly made some request to the Athenians, when Themistocles 
<A NAME="729"></A>was in the height of his authority, and had been disdainfully used and 
<A NAME="730"></A>insulted by him, and had let it appear plain enough, that, could he lay 
<A NAME="731"></A>hold of him, he would take his revenge. Yet in this misfortune Themistocles, 
<A NAME="732"></A>fearing the recent hatred of his neighbours and fellow-citizens more than 
<A NAME="733"></A>the old displeasure of the king, put himself at his mercy and became an 
<A NAME="734"></A>humble suppliant to Admetus, after a peculiar manner different from the 
<A NAME="735"></A>custom of other countries. For taking the king's son, who was then a child, 
<A NAME="736"></A>in his arms, he laid himself down at his hearth, this being the most sacred 
<A NAME="737"></A>and only manner of supplication among the Molossians, which was not to 
<A NAME="738"></A>be refused. And some say that his wife, Phthia, intimated to Themistocles 
<A NAME="739"></A>this way of petitioning, and placed her young son with him before the hearth; 
<A NAME="740"></A>others, that king Admetus, that he might be under a religious obligation 
<A NAME="741"></A>not to deliver him up to his pursuers, prepared and enacted with him a 
<A NAME="742"></A>sort of stage-play to this effect. At this time Epicrates of Acharnae privately 
<A NAME="743"></A>conveyed his wife and children out of Athens, and sent them hither, for 
<A NAME="744"></A>which afterwards Cimon condemned him and put him to death; as Stesimbrotus 
<A NAME="745"></A>reports, and yet somehow, either forgetting this himself, or making Themistocles 
<A NAME="746"></A>to be little mindful of it, says presently that he sailed into Sicily, 
<A NAME="747"></A>and desired in marriage the daughter of Hiero, tyrant of Syracuse, promising 
<A NAME="748"></A>to bring the Greeks under his power; and, on Hiero refusing him, departed 
<A NAME="749"></A>thence into Asia; but this is not probable.
<A NAME="750"></A><BR><BR>For Theophrastus writes, in his work on Monarchy, that when Hiero 
<A NAME="751"></A>sent race-horses to the Olympian games, and erected a pavilion sumptuously 
<A NAME="752"></A>furnished, Themistocles made an oration to the Greeks, inciting them to 
<A NAME="753"></A>pull down the tyrant's tent, and not to suffer his horses to run. Thucydides 
<A NAME="754"></A>says, that, passing overland to the Aegaean Sea, he took ship at Pydna 
<A NAME="755"></A>in the bay Therme, not being known to any one in the ship, till, being 
<A NAME="756"></A>terrified to see the vessel driven by the winds near to Naxos, which was 
<A NAME="757"></A>then besieged by the Athenians, he made himself known to the master and 
<A NAME="758"></A>pilot, and partly entreating them, partly threatening that if they went 
<A NAME="759"></A>on shore he would accuse them, and make the Athenians to believe that they 
<A NAME="760"></A>did not take him in out of ignorance, but that he had corrupted them with 
<A NAME="761"></A>money from the beginning, he compelled them to bear off and stand out to 
<A NAME="762"></A>sea, and sail forward towards the coast of Asia.
<A NAME="763"></A><BR><BR>A great part of his estate was privately conveyed away by his friends, 
<A NAME="764"></A>and sent after him by sea into Asia; besides which, there was discovered 
<A NAME="765"></A>and confiscated to the value of fourscore talents, as Theophrastus writes; 
<A NAME="766"></A>Theopompus says an hundred; though Themistocles was never worth three talents 
<A NAME="767"></A>before he was concerned in public affairs.
<A NAME="768"></A><BR><BR>When he arrived at Cyme, and understood that all along the coast 
<A NAME="769"></A>there were many laid wait for him, and particularly Ergoteles and Pythodorus 
<A NAME="770"></A>(for the game was worth the hunting for such as were thankful to make money 
<A NAME="771"></A>by any means, the king of Persia having offered by public proclamation 
<A NAME="772"></A>two hundred talents to him that should take him), he fled to Aegae, a small 
<A NAME="773"></A>city of the Aeolians, where no one knew him but only his host Nicogenes, 
<A NAME="774"></A>who was the richest man in Aeolia, and well known to the great men of Inner 
<A NAME="775"></A>Asia. While Themistocles lay bid for some days in his house, one night, 
<A NAME="776"></A>after a sacrifice and supper ensuing, Olbius, the attendant upon Nicogenes's 
<A NAME="777"></A>children, fell into a sort of frenzy and fit of inspiration, and cried 
<A NAME="778"></A>out in verse-
<A NAME="779"></A><BR><BR>"Night shall speak, and night instruct thee,
<A NAME="780"></A><BR>By the voice of night conduct thee." After this, Themistocles, going 
<A NAME="781"></A>to bed, dreamed that he saw a snake coil itself up upon his belly, and 
<A NAME="782"></A>so creep to his neck; then, as soon as it touched his face, it turned into 
<A NAME="783"></A>an eagle, which spread its wings over him, and took him up and flew away 
<A NAME="784"></A>with him a great distance; then there appeared a herald's golden wand, 
<A NAME="785"></A>and upon this at last it set him down securely, after infinite terror and 
<A NAME="786"></A>disturbance.
<A NAME="787"></A><BR><BR>His departure was effected by Nicogenes by the following artifice: 
<A NAME="788"></A>The barbarous nations, and amongst them the Persians especially, are extremely 
<A NAME="789"></A>jealous, severe, and suspicious about their women, not only their wives, 
<A NAME="790"></A>but also their bought slaves and concubines, whom they keep so strictly 
<A NAME="791"></A>that no one ever sees them abroad; they spend their lives shut up within 
<A NAME="792"></A>doors, and, when they take a journey, are carried in close tents, curtained 
<A NAME="793"></A>in on all sides, and set upon a wagon. Such a travelling carriage being 
<A NAME="794"></A>prepared for Themistocles, they hid him in it, and carried him on his journey, 
<A NAME="795"></A>and told those whom they met or spoke with upon the road that they were 
<A NAME="796"></A>conveying a young Greek woman out of Ionia to a nobleman at 
<A NAME="797"></A>court.
<A NAME="798"></A><BR><BR>Thucydides and Charon of Lampsacus say that Xerxes was dead, and 
<A NAME="799"></A>that Themistocles had an interview with his son; but Ephorus, Dinon, Clitarchus, 
<A NAME="800"></A>Heraclides, and many others, write that he came to Xerxes. The chronological 
<A NAME="801"></A>tables better agree with the account of Thucydides, and yet neither can 
<A NAME="802"></A>their statements be said to be quite set at rest.
<A NAME="803"></A><BR><BR>When Themistocles was come to the critical point, he applied himself 
<A NAME="804"></A>first to Artabanus, commander of a thousand men, telling him that he was 
<A NAME="805"></A>a Greek, and desired to speak with the king about important affairs concerning 
<A NAME="806"></A>which the king was extremely solicitous. Artabanus answered him: "O stranger, 
<A NAME="807"></A>the laws of men are different, and one thing is honourable to one man, 
<A NAME="808"></A>and to others another; but it is honourable for all to honour and observe 
<A NAME="809"></A>their own laws. It is the habit of the Greeks, we are told, to honour, 
<A NAME="810"></A>above all things, liberty and equality; but amongst our many excellent 
<A NAME="811"></A>laws, we account this the most excellent, to honour the king, and to worship 
<A NAME="812"></A>him, as the image of the great preserver of the universe; if, then, you 
<A NAME="813"></A>shall consent to our laws, and fall down before the king and worship him, 
<A NAME="814"></A>you may both see him and speak to him; but if your mind be otherwise, you 
<A NAME="815"></A>must make use of others to intercede for you, for it is not the national 
<A NAME="816"></A>custom here for the king to give audience to any one that doth not fall 
<A NAME="817"></A>down before him." Themistocles, hearing this, replied: "Artabanus, I, that 
<A NAME="818"></A>come hither to increase the power and glory of the king, will not only 
<A NAME="819"></A>submit myself to his laws, since so it hath pleased the god who exalteth 
<A NAME="820"></A>the Persian empire to this greatness, but will also cause many more to 
<A NAME="821"></A>be worshippers and adorers of the king. Let not this, therefore, be an 
<A NAME="822"></A>impediment why I should not communicate to the king what I have to impart." 
<A NAME="823"></A>Artabanus asking him, "Who must we tell him that you are? for your words 
<A NAME="824"></A>signify you to be no ordinary person." Themistocles answered, "No man, 
<A NAME="825"></A>O Artabanus, must be informed of this before the king himself." Thus Phanias 
<A NAME="826"></A>relates; to which Eratosthenes, in his treatise on Riches, adds, that it 
<A NAME="827"></A>was by the means of a woman of Eretria, who was kept by Artabanus, that 
<A NAME="828"></A>he obtained this audience and interview with him.
<A NAME="829"></A><BR><BR>When he was introduced to the king, and had paid his reverence 
<A NAME="830"></A>to him, he stood silent, till the king commanding the interpreter to ask 
<A NAME="831"></A>him who he was, he replied, "O king, I am Themistocles the Athenian, driven 
<A NAME="832"></A>into banishment by the Greeks. The evils that I have done to the Persians 
<A NAME="833"></A>are numerous; but my benefits to them yet greater, in withholding the Greeks 
<A NAME="834"></A>from pursuit, so soon as the deliverance of my own country allowed me to 
<A NAME="835"></A>show kindness also to you. I come with a mind suited to my present calamities; 
<A NAME="836"></A>prepared alike for favours and for anger; to welcome your gracious reconciliation, 
<A NAME="837"></A>and to deprecate your wrath. Take my own countrymen for witnesses of the 
<A NAME="838"></A>services I have done for Persia, and make use of this occasion to show 
<A NAME="839"></A>the world your virtue, rather than to satisfy your indignation. If you 
<A NAME="840"></A>save me, you will save your suppliant; if otherwise, will destroy an enemy 
<A NAME="841"></A>of the Greeks." He talked also of divine admonitions, such as the vision 
<A NAME="842"></A>which he saw at Nicogenes's house, and the direction given him by the oracle 
<A NAME="843"></A>of Dodona, where Jupiter commanded him to go to him that had a name like 
<A NAME="844"></A>his, by which he understood that he was sent from Jupiter to him, seeing 
<A NAME="845"></A>that they both were great, and had the name of kings.
<A NAME="846"></A><BR><BR>The king heard him attentively, and, though he admired his temper 
<A NAME="847"></A>and courage, gave him no answer at that time; but, when he was with his 
<A NAME="848"></A>intimate friends, rejoiced in his great good fortune, and esteemed himself 
<A NAME="849"></A>very happy in this, and prayed to his god Arimanius, that all his enemies 
<A NAME="850"></A>might be ever of the same mind with the Greeks, to abuse and expel the 
<A NAME="851"></A>bravest men amongst them. Then he sacrificed to the gods, and presently 
<A NAME="852"></A>fell to drinking, and was so well pleased, that in the night, in the middle 
<A NAME="853"></A>of his sleep, he cried out for joy three times, "I have Themistocles the 
<A NAME="854"></A>Athenian."
<A NAME="855"></A><BR><BR>In the morning, calling together the chief of his court, he had 
<A NAME="856"></A>Themistocles brought before him, who expected no good of it, when he saw, 
<A NAME="857"></A>for example, the guards fiercely set against him as soon as they learnt 
<A NAME="858"></A>his name, and giving him ill language. As he came forward towards the king, 
<A NAME="859"></A>who was seated, the rest keeping silence, passing by Roxanes, a commander 
<A NAME="860"></A>of a thousand men, he heard him, with a slight groan, say, without stirring 
<A NAME="861"></A>out of his place, "You subtle Greek serpent, the king's good genius hath 
<A NAME="862"></A>brought thee thither." Yet, when he came into the presence, and again fell 
<A NAME="863"></A>down, the king saluted him, and spake to him kindly, telling him he was 
<A NAME="864"></A>now indebted to him two hundred talents; for it was just and reasonable 
<A NAME="865"></A>that he should receive the reward which was proposed to whosoever should 
<A NAME="866"></A>bring Themistocles; and promising much more, and encouraging him, he commanded 
<A NAME="867"></A>him to speak freely what he would concerning the affairs of Greece. Themistocles 
<A NAME="868"></A>replied, that a man's discourse was like to a rich Persian carpet, the 
<A NAME="869"></A>beautiful figures and patterns of which can only be shown by spreading 
<A NAME="870"></A>and extending it out; when it is contracted and folded up, they are obscure 
<A NAME="871"></A>and lost; and, therefore, he desired time. The king being pleased with 
<A NAME="872"></A>the comparison, and bidding him take what time he would, he desired a year; 
<A NAME="873"></A>in which time, having learnt the Persian language sufficiently, he spoke 
<A NAME="874"></A>with the king by himself without the help of an interpreter, it being supposed 
<A NAME="875"></A>that he discoursed only about the affairs of Greece; but there happening, 
<A NAME="876"></A>at the same time, great alterations at court, and removals of the king's 
<A NAME="877"></A>favourites, he drew upon himself the envy of the great people, who imagined 
<A NAME="878"></A>that he had taken the boldness to speak concerning them. For the favours 
<A NAME="879"></A>shown to other strangers were nothing in comparison with the honours conferred 
<A NAME="880"></A>on him; the king invited him to partake of his own pastimes and recreations 
<A NAME="881"></A>both at home and abroad, carrying him with him a-hunting, and made him 
<A NAME="882"></A>his intimate so far that he permitted him to see the queen-mother, and 
<A NAME="883"></A>converse frequently with her. By the king's command, he also was made acquainted 
<A NAME="884"></A>with the Magian learning.
<A NAME="885"></A><BR><BR>When Demaratus the Lacedaemonian, being ordered by the king to 
<A NAME="886"></A>ask whatsoever he pleased, that it should immediately be granted him, desired 
<A NAME="887"></A>that he might make his public entrance, and be carried in state through 
<A NAME="888"></A>the city of Sardis, with the tiara set in the royal manner upon his head, 
<A NAME="889"></A>Mithropaustes, cousin to the king, touched him on the head, and told him 
<A NAME="890"></A>that he had no brains for the royal tiara to cover, and if Jupiter should 
<A NAME="891"></A>give him his lightning and thunder, he would not any the more be Jupiter 
<A NAME="892"></A>for that; the king also repulsed him with anger, resolving never to be 
<A NAME="893"></A>reconciled to him, but to be inexorable to all supplications on his behalf. 
<A NAME="894"></A>Yet Themistocles pacified him, and prevailed with him to forgive him. And 
<A NAME="895"></A>it is reported that the succeeding kings, in whose reigns there was a greater 
<A NAME="896"></A>communication between the Greeks and Persians, when they invited any considerable 
<A NAME="897"></A>Greek into their service, to encourage him, would write, and promise him 
<A NAME="898"></A>that he should be as great with them as Themistocles had been. They relate, 
<A NAME="899"></A>also, how Themistocles, when he was in great prosperity, and courted by 
<A NAME="900"></A>many, seeing himself splendidly served at his table, turned to his children 
<A NAME="901"></A>and said, "Children, we had been undone if we had not been undone." Most 
<A NAME="902"></A>writers say that he had three cities given him, Magnesia, Myus, and Lampsacus, 
<A NAME="903"></A>to maintain him in bread, meat, and wine. Neanthes of Cyzicus, and Phanias, 
<A NAME="904"></A>add two more, the city of Palaescepsis, to provide him with clothes, and 
<A NAME="905"></A>Percote, with bedding and furniture for his house.
<A NAME="906"></A><BR><BR>As he was going down towards the sea-coast to take measures against 
<A NAME="907"></A>Greece, a Persian whose name was Epixyes, governor of the upper Phrygia, 
<A NAME="908"></A>laid wait to kill him, having for that purpose provided a long time before 
<A NAME="909"></A>a number of Pisidians, who were to set upon him when he should stop to 
<A NAME="910"></A>rest at a city that is called Lion's-head. But Themistocles, sleeping in 
<A NAME="911"></A>the middle of the day, saw the Mother of the gods appear to him in a dream 
<A NAME="912"></A>and say unto him, "Themistocles, keep back from the Lion's-head, for fear 
<A NAME="913"></A>you fall into the lion's jaws; for this advice I expect that your daughter 
<A NAME="914"></A>Mnesiptolema should be my servant." Themistocles was much astonished, and 
<A NAME="915"></A>when he had made his vows to the goddess, left the broad road, and, making 
<A NAME="916"></A>a circuit, went another way, changing his intended station to avoid that 
<A NAME="917"></A>place, and at night took up his rest in the fields. But one of the sumpter-horses, 
<A NAME="918"></A>which carried the furniture for his tent, having fallen that day into the 
<A NAME="919"></A>river, his servants spread out the tapestry, which was wet, and hung it 
<A NAME="920"></A>up to dry; in the meantime the Pisidians made towards them with their swords 
<A NAME="921"></A>drawn, and, not discerning exactly by the moon what it was that was stretched 
<A NAME="922"></A>out, thought it to be the tent of Themistocles, and that they should find 
<A NAME="923"></A>him resting himself within it; but when they came near, and lifted up the 
<A NAME="924"></A>hangings, those who watched there fell upon them and took them. Themistocles, 
<A NAME="925"></A>having escaped this great danger, in admiration of the goodness of the 
<A NAME="926"></A>goddess that appeared to him, built, in memory of it, a temple in the city 
<A NAME="927"></A>of Magnesia, which is dedicated to Dindymene, Mother of the gods, in which 
<A NAME="928"></A>he consecrated and devoted his daughter Mnesiptolema to her 
<A NAME="929"></A>service.
<A NAME="930"></A><BR><BR>When he came to Sardis, he visited the temples of the gods, and 
<A NAME="931"></A>observing, at his leisure, their buildings, ornaments, and the number of 
<A NAME="932"></A>their offerings, he saw in the temple of the Mother of the gods the statue 
<A NAME="933"></A>of a virgin in brass, two cubits high, called the water-bringer. Themistocles 
<A NAME="934"></A>had caused this to be made and set up when he was surveyor of the waters 
<A NAME="935"></A>at Athens out of the fines of those whom he detected in drawing off and 
<A NAME="936"></A>diverting the public water by pipes for their private use; and whether 
<A NAME="937"></A>he had some regret to see this image in captivity, or was desirous to let 
<A NAME="938"></A>the Athenians see in what great credit and authority he was with the king, 
<A NAME="939"></A>he entered into a treaty with the governor to persuade him to send this 
<A NAME="940"></A>statue back to Athens, which so enraged the Persian officer, that he told 
<A NAME="941"></A>him he would write the king word of it. Themistocles, being affrighted 
<A NAME="942"></A>hereat, got access to his wives and concubines, by presents of money to 
<A NAME="943"></A>whom he appeased the fury of the governor; and afterwards behaved with 
<A NAME="944"></A>more reserve and circumspection, fearing the envy of the Persians, and 
<A NAME="945"></A>did not, as Theopompus writes, continue to travel about Asia, but lived 
<A NAME="946"></A>quietly in his own house in Magnesia, where for a long time he passed his 
<A NAME="947"></A>days in great security, being courted by all, and enjoying rich presents, 
<A NAME="948"></A>and honoured equally with the greatest persons in the Persian empire; the 
<A NAME="949"></A>king, at that time, not minding his concerns with Greece, being taken up 
<A NAME="950"></A>with the affairs of inner Asia.
<A NAME="951"></A><BR><BR>But when Egypt revolted, being assisted by the Athenians, and the 
<A NAME="952"></A>Greek galleys roved about as far as Cyprus and Cilicia, and Cimon had made 
<A NAME="953"></A>himself master of the seas, the king turned his thoughts thither, and, 
<A NAME="954"></A>bending his mind chiefly to resist the Greeks, and to check the growth 
<A NAME="955"></A>of their power against him, began to raise forces, and send out commanders, 
<A NAME="956"></A>and to despatch messengers to Themistocles at Magnesia, to put him in mind 
<A NAME="957"></A>of his promise, and to summon him to act against the Greeks. Yet this did 
<A NAME="958"></A>not increase his hatred nor exasperate him against the Athenians, neither 
<A NAME="959"></A>was he in any way elevated with the thoughts of the honour and powerful 
<A NAME="960"></A>command he was to have in this war; but judging, perhaps, that the object 
<A NAME="961"></A>would not be attained, the Greeks having at that time, beside other great 
<A NAME="962"></A>commanders, Cimon, in particular, who was gaining wonderful military successes; 
<A NAME="963"></A>but chiefly being ashamed to sully the glory of his former great actions, 
<A NAME="964"></A>and of his many victories and trophies, he determined to put a conclusion 
<A NAME="965"></A>to his life, agreeable to its previous course. He sacrificed to the gods, 
<A NAME="966"></A>and invited his friends; and, having entertained them and shaken hands 
<A NAME="967"></A>with them, drank bull's blood, as is the usual story; as others state, 
<A NAME="968"></A>a poison producing instant death; and ended his days in the city of Magnesia, 
<A NAME="969"></A>having lived sixty-five years, most of which he had spent in politics and 
<A NAME="970"></A>in wars, in government and command. The king being informed of the cause 
<A NAME="971"></A>and manner of his death, admired him more than ever, and continued to show 
<A NAME="972"></A>kindness to his friends and relations.
<A NAME="973"></A><BR><BR>Themistocles left three sons by Archippe, daughter to Lysander 
<A NAME="974"></A>of Alopece,- Archeptolis, Poleuctus, and Cleophantus. Plato, the philosopher, 
<A NAME="975"></A>mentions the last as a most excellent horseman, but otherwise insignificant 
<A NAME="976"></A>person; of two sons yet older than these, Neocles and Diocles, Neocles 
<A NAME="977"></A>died when he was young by the bite of a horse, and Diocles was adopted 
<A NAME="978"></A>by his grandfather, Lysander. He had many daughters, of whom Mnesiptolema, 
<A NAME="979"></A>whom he had by a second marriage, was wife to Archeptolis, her brother 
<A NAME="980"></A>by another mother; Italia was married to Panthoides, of the island of Chios; 
<A NAME="981"></A>Sybaris to Nicomedes the Athenian. After the death of Themistocles, his 
<A NAME="982"></A>nephew, Phrasicles, went to Magnesia, and married, with her brothers' consent, 
<A NAME="983"></A>another daughter, Nicomache, and took charge of her sister Asia, the youngest 
<A NAME="984"></A>of all the children.
<A NAME="985"></A><BR><BR>The Magnesians possess a splendid sepulchre of Themistocles, placed 
<A NAME="986"></A>in the middle of their market-place. It is not worth while taking notice 
<A NAME="987"></A>of what Andocides states in his address to his Friends concerning his remains, 
<A NAME="988"></A>how the Athenian robbed his tomb, and threw his ashes into the air; for 
<A NAME="989"></A>he feigns this, to exasperate the oligarchical faction against the people; 
<A NAME="990"></A>and there is no man living but knows that Phylarchus simply invents in 
<A NAME="991"></A>his history, where he all but uses an actual stage machine, and brings 
<A NAME="992"></A>in Neocles and Demopolis as the sons of Themistocles, to incite or move 
<A NAME="993"></A>compassion, as if he were writing a tragedy. Diodorus the cosmographer 
<A NAME="994"></A>says, in his work on Tombs, but by conjecture rather than of certain knowledge, 
<A NAME="995"></A>that near to the haven of Piraeus where the land runs out like an elbow 
<A NAME="996"></A>from the promontory of Alcimus, when you have doubled the cape and passed 
<A NAME="997"></A>inward where the sea is always calm, there is a large piece of masonry, 
<A NAME="998"></A>and upon this the Tomb of Themistocles, in the shape of an altar; and Plato 
<A NAME="999"></A>the comedian confirms this, he believes, in these verses:-
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR><BR>"Thy tomb is fairly placed upon the strand,
<A NAME="1001"></A><BR>Where merchants still shall greet it with the land;
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR>Still in and out 'twill see them come and go,
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR>And watch the galleys as they race below."
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR><BR>Various honours also and privileges were granted to the kindred 
<A NAME="1005"></A>of Themistocles at Magnesia, which were observed down to our times, and 
<A NAME="1006"></A>were enjoyed by another Themistocles of Athens, with whom I had an intimate 
<A NAME="1007"></A>acquaintance and friendship in the house of Ammonius the 
<A NAME="1008"></A>philosopher.
