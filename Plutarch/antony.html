<A NAME="2"></A>
<BR>(died 30 B.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>The grandfather of Antony was the famous pleader, whom Marius put to death 
<A NAME="11"></A>for having taken part with Sylla. His father was Antony, surnamed of Crete, 
<A NAME="12"></A>not very famous or distinguished in public life, but a worthy good man, 
<A NAME="13"></A>and particularly remarkable for his liberality, as may appear from a single 
<A NAME="14"></A>example. He was not very rich, and was for that reason checked in the exercise 
<A NAME="15"></A>of his good nature by his wife. A friend that stood in need of money came 
<A NAME="16"></A>to borrow of him. Money he had none, but he bade a servant bring him water 
<A NAME="17"></A>in a silver basin, with which, when it was brought, he wetted his face, 
<A NAME="18"></A>as if he meant to shave, and, sending away the servant upon another errand, 
<A NAME="19"></A>gave his, friend the basin, desiring him to turn it to his purpose. And 
<A NAME="20"></A>when there was, afterwards, a great inquiry for it in the house, and his 
<A NAME="21"></A>wife was in a very ill-humour, and was going to put the servants one by 
<A NAME="22"></A>one to the search, he acknowledged what he had done, and begged her 
<A NAME="23"></A>pardon.
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR>His wife was Julia, of the family of the Caesars, who, for her 
<A NAME="25"></A>discretion and fair was not inferior to any of her time. Under her, Antony 
<A NAME="26"></A>received his education, she being, after the death of his father, remarried 
<A NAME="27"></A>to Cornelius Lentulus, who was put to death by Cicero for having been of 
<A NAME="28"></A>Catiline's conspiracy. This, probably, was the first ground and occasion 
<A NAME="29"></A>of that mortal grudge that Antony bore Cicero. He says, even, that the 
<A NAME="30"></A>body of Lentulus was denied burial, till, by application made to Cicero's 
<A NAME="31"></A>wife, it was granted to Julia. But this seems to be a manifest error, for 
<A NAME="32"></A>none of those that suffered in the consulate of Cicero had the right of 
<A NAME="33"></A>burial denied them. Antony grew up a very beautiful youth, but by the worst 
<A NAME="34"></A>of misfortunes, he fell into the acquaintance and friendship of Curio, 
<A NAME="35"></A>a man abandoned to his pleasures, who, to make Antony's dependence upon 
<A NAME="36"></A>him a matter of greater necessity, plunged him into a life of drinking 
<A NAME="37"></A>and dissipation, and led him through a course of such extravagance that 
<A NAME="38"></A>he ran, at that early age, into debt to the amount of two hundred and fifty 
<A NAME="39"></A>talents. For this sum Curio became his surety; on hearing which, the elder 
<A NAME="40"></A>Curio, his father, drove Antony out of his house. After this, for some 
<A NAME="41"></A>short time he took part with Clodius, the most insolent and outrageous 
<A NAME="42"></A>demagogue of the time, in his course of violence and disorder; but getting 
<A NAME="43"></A>weary before long, of his madness, and apprehensive of the powerful party 
<A NAME="44"></A>forming against him, he left Italy and travelled into Greece, where he 
<A NAME="45"></A>spent his time in military exercises and in the study of eloquence. He 
<A NAME="46"></A>took most to what was called the Asiatic taste in speaking, which was then 
<A NAME="47"></A>at its height, and was, in many ways, suitable to his ostentatious, vaunting 
<A NAME="48"></A>temper, full of empty flourishes and unsteady efforts for 
<A NAME="49"></A>glory.
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR>After some stay in Greece, he was invited by Gabinius, who had 
<A NAME="51"></A>been consul, to make a campaign with him in Syria, which at first he refused, 
<A NAME="52"></A>not being willing to serve in a private character, but receiving a commission 
<A NAME="53"></A>to command the horse, he went along with him. His first-service was against 
<A NAME="54"></A>Aristobulus, who had prevailed with the Jews to rebel. Here he was himself 
<A NAME="55"></A>the first man to scale the largest of the works, and beat Aristobulus out 
<A NAME="56"></A>of all of them; after which he routed in a pitched battle, an army many 
<A NAME="57"></A>times over the number of his, killed almost all of them and took Aristobulus 
<A NAME="58"></A>and his son prisoners. This war ended, Gabinius was solicited by Ptolemy 
<A NAME="59"></A>to restore him to his kingdom of Egypt, and a promise made of ten thousand 
<A NAME="60"></A>talents reward. Most of the officers were against this enterprise, and 
<A NAME="61"></A>Gabinius himself did not much like it, though sorely tempted by the ten 
<A NAME="62"></A>thousand talents. But Antony, desirous of brave actions and willing to 
<A NAME="63"></A>please Ptolemy, joined in persuading Gabinius to go. And whereas all were 
<A NAME="64"></A>of opinion that the most dangerous thing before them was the march to Pelusium, 
<A NAME="65"></A>in which they would have to pass over a deep sand, where no fresh water 
<A NAME="66"></A>was to be hoped for, along the Acregma and the Serbonian marsh (which the 
<A NAME="67"></A>Egyptians call Typhon's breathing-hole, and which is, in probability, water 
<A NAME="68"></A>left behind by, or making its way through from, the Red Sea, which is here 
<A NAME="69"></A>divided from the Mediterranean by a narrow isthmus), Antony, being ordered 
<A NAME="70"></A>thither with the horse, not only made himself master of the passes, but 
<A NAME="71"></A>won Pelusium itself, a great city, took the garrison prisoners, and by 
<A NAME="72"></A>this means rendered the march secure to the army, and the way to victory 
<A NAME="73"></A>not difficult for the general to pursue. The enemy also reaped some benefit 
<A NAME="74"></A>of his eagerness for honour. For when Ptolemy, after he had entered Pelusium, 
<A NAME="75"></A>in his rage and spite against the Egyptians, designed to put them to the 
<A NAME="76"></A>sword, Antony withstood him, and hindered the execution. In all the great 
<A NAME="77"></A>and frequent skirmishes and battles he gave continual proofs of his personal 
<A NAME="78"></A>valour and military conduct; and once in particular, by wheeling about 
<A NAME="79"></A>and attacking the rear of the enemy, he gave the victory to the assailants 
<A NAME="80"></A>in the front, and received for this service signal marks of distinction. 
<A NAME="81"></A>Nor was his humanity towards the deceased Archelaus less taken notice of. 
<A NAME="82"></A>He had been formerly his guest and acquaintance, and, as he was now compelled, 
<A NAME="83"></A>he fought him bravely while alive, but on his death, sought out his body 
<A NAME="84"></A>and buried it with royal honours. The consequence was that he left behind 
<A NAME="85"></A>him a great name among the Alexandrians, and all who were serving in the 
<A NAME="86"></A>Roman army looked upon him as a most gallant soldier.
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR>He had also a very good and noble appearance; his beard was well 
<A NAME="88"></A>grown, his forehead large, and his nose aquiline, giving him altogether 
<A NAME="89"></A>a bold, masculine look that reminded people of the faces of Hercules in 
<A NAME="90"></A>paintings and sculptures. It was, moreover, an ancient tradition, that 
<A NAME="91"></A>the Antonys were descended from Hercules, by a son of his called Anton; 
<A NAME="92"></A>and this opinion he thought to give credit to by the similarity of his 
<A NAME="93"></A>person just mentioned, and also by the fashion of his dress. For, whenever 
<A NAME="94"></A>he had to appear before large numbers, he wore his tunic girt low about 
<A NAME="95"></A>the hips, a broadsword on his side, and over all a large coarse mantle. 
<A NAME="96"></A>What might seem to some very insupportable, his vaunting, his raillery, 
<A NAME="97"></A>his drinking in public, sitting down by the men as they were taking their 
<A NAME="98"></A>food, and eating, as he stood, off the common soldiers' tables, made him 
<A NAME="99"></A>the delight and pleasure of the army. In love affairs, also, he was very 
<A NAME="100"></A>agreeable: he gained many friends by the assistance he gave them in theirs, 
<A NAME="101"></A>and took other people's raillery upon his own with good-humour. And his 
<A NAME="102"></A>generous ways, his open and lavish hand in gifts and favours to his friends 
<A NAME="103"></A>and fellow-soldiers, did a great deal for him in his first advance to power, 
<A NAME="104"></A>and after he had become great, long maintained his fortunes, when a thousand 
<A NAME="105"></A>follies were hastening their overthrow. One instance of his liberality 
<A NAME="106"></A>I must relate. He had ordered payment to one of his friends of twenty-five 
<A NAME="107"></A>myriads of money or decies, as the Romans call it, and his steward wondering 
<A NAME="108"></A>at the extravagance of the sum, laid all the silver in a heap, as he should 
<A NAME="109"></A>pass by. Antony, seeing the heap, asked what it meant; his steward replied, 
<A NAME="110"></A>"The money you have ordered to be given to your friend." So, perceiving 
<A NAME="111"></A>the man's malice, said he, "I thought the decies had been much more; 'tis 
<A NAME="112"></A>too little; let it be doubled." This, however, was at a later 
<A NAME="113"></A>time.
<A NAME="114"></A><BR><BR>When the Roman state finally broke up into two hostile factions, 
<A NAME="115"></A>the aristocratical party joining Pompey, who was in the city, and the popular 
<A NAME="116"></A>side seeking help from Caesar, who was at the head of an army in Gaul, 
<A NAME="117"></A>Curio, the friend of Antony, having changed his party and devoted himself 
<A NAME="118"></A>to Caesar, brought over Antony also to his service. And the influence which 
<A NAME="119"></A>he gained with the people by his eloquence and by the money which was supplied 
<A NAME="120"></A>by Caesar, enabled him to make Antony, first, tribune of the people, and 
<A NAME="121"></A>then, augur. And Antony's accession to office was at once of the greatest 
<A NAME="122"></A>advantage to Caesar. In the first place, he resisted the consul Marcellus, 
<A NAME="123"></A>who was putting under Pompey's orders the troops who were already collected, 
<A NAME="124"></A>and was giving him power to raise new levies; he, on the other hand, making 
<A NAME="125"></A>an order that they should be sent into Syria to reinforce Bibulus, who 
<A NAME="126"></A>was making war with the Parthians, and that no one should give in his name 
<A NAME="127"></A>to serve under Pompey. Next, when the senators would not suffer Caesar's 
<A NAME="128"></A>letters to be received or read in the senate, by virtue of his office he 
<A NAME="129"></A>read them publicly, and succeeded so well, that many were brought to change 
<A NAME="130"></A>their mind; Caesar's demands, as they appeared in what he wrote, being 
<A NAME="131"></A>but just and reasonable. At length, two questions being put in the senate, 
<A NAME="132"></A>the one, whether Pompey should dismiss his army, the other, if Caesar his, 
<A NAME="133"></A>some were for the former, for the latter all, except some few, when Antony 
<A NAME="134"></A>stood up and put the question, if it would be agreeable to them that both 
<A NAME="135"></A>Pompey and Caesar should dismiss their armies. This proposal met with the 
<A NAME="136"></A>greatest approval, they gave him loud acclamations, and called for it to 
<A NAME="137"></A>be put to the vote. But when the consuls would not have it so, Caesar's 
<A NAME="138"></A>friends again made some few offers, very fair and equitable, but were strongly 
<A NAME="139"></A>opposed by Cato, and Antony himself was commanded to leave the senate by 
<A NAME="140"></A>the consul Lentulus. So, leaving them with execrations, and disguising 
<A NAME="141"></A>himself in a servant's dress, hiring a carriage with Quintus Cassius, he 
<A NAME="142"></A>went straight away to Caesar, declaring at once, when they reached the 
<A NAME="143"></A>camp, that affairs at Rome were conducted without any order or justice, 
<A NAME="144"></A>that the privilege of speaking in the senate was denied the tribunes, and 
<A NAME="145"></A>that he who spoke for common fair dealing was driven out and in danger 
<A NAME="146"></A>of his life.
<A NAME="147"></A><BR><BR>Upon this, Caesar set his army in motion, and marched into Italy; 
<A NAME="148"></A>and for this reason it is that Cicero writes in his Philippics that Antony 
<A NAME="149"></A>was as much the cause of the civil war as Helen was of the Trojan. But 
<A NAME="150"></A>this is but a calumny. For Caesar was not of so slight or weak a temper 
<A NAME="151"></A>as to suffer himself to be carried away, by the indignation of the moment, 
<A NAME="152"></A>into a civil war with his country, upon the sight of Antony and Cassius 
<A NAME="153"></A>seeking refuge in his camp meanly dressed and in a hired carriage, without 
<A NAME="154"></A>ever having thought of it or taken any such resolution long before. This 
<A NAME="155"></A>was to him, who wanted a pretence of declaring war, a fair and plausible 
<A NAME="156"></A>occasion; but the true motive that led him was the same that formerly led 
<A NAME="157"></A>Alexander and Cyrus against all mankind, the unquenchable thirst of empire, 
<A NAME="158"></A>and the distracted ambition of being the greatest man in the world, which 
<A NAME="159"></A>was impracticable for him, unless Pompey were put down. So soon, then, 
<A NAME="160"></A>as he had advanced and occupied Rome, and driven Pompey out of Italy, he 
<A NAME="161"></A>proposed first to go against the legions that Pompey had in Spain, and 
<A NAME="162"></A>then cross over and follow him with the fleet that should be prepared during 
<A NAME="163"></A>his absence, in the meantime leaving the government of Rome to Lepidus, 
<A NAME="164"></A>as praetor, and the command of the troops and of Italy to Antony, as tribune 
<A NAME="165"></A>of the people. Antony was not long in getting the hearts of the soldiers, 
<A NAME="166"></A>joining with them in their exercises, and for the most part living amongst 
<A NAME="167"></A>them and making them presents to the utmost of his abilities; but with 
<A NAME="168"></A>all others he was unpopular enough. He was too lazy to pay attention to 
<A NAME="169"></A>the complaints of persons who were injured; he listened impatiently to 
<A NAME="170"></A>petitions; and he had an ill name for familiarity with other people's wives. 
<A NAME="171"></A>In short, the government of Caesar (which, so far as he was concerned himself, 
<A NAME="172"></A>had the appearance of anything rather than a tyranny) got a bad repute 
<A NAME="173"></A>through his friends. And of these friends, Antony, as he had the largest 
<A NAME="174"></A>trust, and committed the greatest errors, was thought the most deeply in 
<A NAME="175"></A>fault.
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, however, at his return from Spain, overlooked the charges 
<A NAME="177"></A>against him, and had no reason ever to complain, in the employments he 
<A NAME="178"></A>gave him in the war, of any want of courage, energy, or military skill. 
<A NAME="179"></A>He himself, going aboard at Brundusium, sailed over the Ionian Sea with 
<A NAME="180"></A>a few troops and sent back the vessels with orders to Antony and Gabinius 
<A NAME="181"></A>to embark the army, and come over with all speed to Macedonia. Gabinius, 
<A NAME="182"></A>having no mind to put to sea in the rough, dangerous weather of the winter 
<A NAME="183"></A>season, was for marching the army round by the long land route; but Antony, 
<A NAME="184"></A>being more afraid lest Caesar might suffer from the number of his enemies, 
<A NAME="185"></A>who pressed him hard, beat back Libo, who was watching with a fleet at 
<A NAME="186"></A>the mouth of the haven of Brundusium, by attacking his galleys with a number 
<A NAME="187"></A>of small boats, and gaining thus an opportunity, put on board twenty thousand 
<A NAME="188"></A>foot and eight hundred horse, and so set out to sea. And, being espied 
<A NAME="189"></A>by the enemy and pursued, from this danger he was rescued by a strong south 
<A NAME="190"></A>wind, which sprang up and raised so high a sea that the enemy's galleys 
<A NAME="191"></A>could make little way. But his own ships were driving before it upon a 
<A NAME="192"></A>lee shore of cliffs and rocks running sheer to the water, where there was 
<A NAME="193"></A>no hope of escape, when all of a sudden the wind turned about to south-west, 
<A NAME="194"></A>and blew from land to the main sea, where Antony, now sailing in security, 
<A NAME="195"></A>saw the coast all covered with the wreck of the enemy's fleet. For hither 
<A NAME="196"></A>the galleys in pursuit had been carried by the gale, and not a few of them 
<A NAME="197"></A>dashed to pieces. Many men and much property fell into Antony's hands; 
<A NAME="198"></A>he took also the town of Lissus, and, by the seasonable arrival of so large 
<A NAME="199"></A>a reinforcement, gave Caesar great encouragement.
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR>There was not one of the many engagements that now took place one 
<A NAME="201"></A>after another in which he did not signalize himself; twice he stopped the 
<A NAME="202"></A>army in its full flight, led them back to a charge, and gained the victory. 
<A NAME="203"></A>So that now without reason his reputation, next to Caesar's, was greatest 
<A NAME="204"></A>in the army. And what opinion Caesar himself had of him well appeared when, 
<A NAME="205"></A>for the final battle in Pharsalia, which was to determine everything, he 
<A NAME="206"></A>himself chose to lead the right wing, committing the charge of the left 
<A NAME="207"></A>to Antony, as to the best officer of all that served under him. After the 
<A NAME="208"></A>battle, Caesar, being created dictator, went in pursuit of Pompey, and 
<A NAME="209"></A>sent Antony to Rome, with the character of Master of the Horse, who is 
<A NAME="210"></A>in office and power next to the dictator, when present, and in his absence 
<A NAME="211"></A>the first, and pretty nearly indeed the sole magistrate. For on the appointment 
<A NAME="212"></A>of a dictator, with the one exception of the tribunes, all other magistrates 
<A NAME="213"></A>cease to exercise any authority in Rome.
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR>Dolabella, however, who was tribune, being a young man and eager 
<A NAME="215"></A>for change, was now for bringing in a general measure for cancelling debts, 
<A NAME="216"></A>and wanted Antony, who was his friend, and forward enough to promote any 
<A NAME="217"></A>popular project, to take part with him in this step. Asinius and Trebellius 
<A NAME="218"></A>were of the contrary opinion, and it so happened, at the same time, Antony 
<A NAME="219"></A>was crossed by a terrible suspicion that Dolabella was too familiar with 
<A NAME="220"></A>his wife; and in great trouble at this, he parted with her (she being his 
<A NAME="221"></A>cousin, and daughter to Caius Antonius, colleague of Cicero), and, taking 
<A NAME="222"></A>part with Asinius, came to open hostilities with Dolabella, who had seized 
<A NAME="223"></A>on the forum, intending to pass his law by force. Antony, backed by a vote 
<A NAME="224"></A>of the senate that Dolabella should be put down by force of arms, went 
<A NAME="225"></A>down and attacked him, killing some of his, and losing some of his own 
<A NAME="226"></A>men; and by this action lost his favour with the commonalty, while with 
<A NAME="227"></A>the better class and with all well-conducted people his general course 
<A NAME="228"></A>of life made him, as Cicero says absolutely odious, utter disgust being 
<A NAME="229"></A>excited by his drinking bouts at all hours, his wild expenses, his gross 
<A NAME="230"></A>amours, the day spent in sleeping or walking off his debauches, and the 
<A NAME="231"></A>night in banquets and at theatres, and in celebrating the nuptials of some 
<A NAME="232"></A>comedian or buffoon. It is related that, drinking all night at the wedding 
<A NAME="233"></A>of Hippias, the comedian, on the morning, having to harangue the people, 
<A NAME="234"></A>he came forward, overcharged as he was, and vomited before them all, one 
<A NAME="235"></A>of his friends holding his gown for him. Sergius, the player, was one of 
<A NAME="236"></A>the friends who could do most with him; also Cytheris, a woman of the same 
<A NAME="237"></A>trade, whom he made much of, and who, when he went his progress, accompanied 
<A NAME="238"></A>him in a litter, and had her equipage not in anything inferior to his mother's; 
<A NAME="239"></A>while every one, moreover, was scandalized at the sight of the golden cups 
<A NAME="240"></A>that he took with him, fitter for the ornaments of a procession than the 
<A NAME="241"></A>uses of a journey, at his having pavilions set up, and sumptuous morning 
<A NAME="242"></A>repasts laid out by river sides and in groves, at his having chariots drawn 
<A NAME="243"></A>by lions, and common women and singing girls quartered upon the houses 
<A NAME="244"></A>of serious fathers and mothers of families. And it seemed very unreasonable 
<A NAME="245"></A>that Caesar, out of Italy, should lodge in the open field, and with great 
<A NAME="246"></A>fatigue and danger, pursue the remainder of a hazardous war, whilst others, 
<A NAME="247"></A>by favour of his authority, should insult the citizens with their impudent 
<A NAME="248"></A>luxury.
<A NAME="249"></A><BR><BR>All this appears to have aggravated party quarrels in Rome, and 
<A NAME="250"></A>to have encouraged the soldiers in acts of licence and rapacity. And, accordingly, 
<A NAME="251"></A>when Caesar came home, he acquitted Dolabella, and, being created the third 
<A NAME="252"></A>time consul, took not Antony, but Lepidus, for his colleague. Pompey's 
<A NAME="253"></A>house being offered for sale, Antony bought it, and when the price was 
<A NAME="254"></A>demanded of him, loudly complained. This, he tells us himself and because 
<A NAME="255"></A>he thought his former services had not been recompensed as they deserved, 
<A NAME="256"></A>made him not follow Caesar with the army into Libya. However, Caesar, by 
<A NAME="257"></A>dealing gently with his errors, seems to have succeeded in curing him of 
<A NAME="258"></A>a good deal of his folly and extravagance. He gave up his former courses, 
<A NAME="259"></A>and took a wife, Fulvia, the widow of Clodius the demagogue, a woman not 
<A NAME="260"></A>born for spinning or housewifery, nor one that could be content with ruling 
<A NAME="261"></A>a private husband, but prepared to govern a first magistrate, or give orders 
<A NAME="262"></A>to a commander-in-chief. So that Cleopatra had great obligations to her 
<A NAME="263"></A>for having taught Antony to be so good a servant, he coming to her hands 
<A NAME="264"></A>tame and broken into entire obedience to the commands of a mistress. He 
<A NAME="265"></A>used to play all sorts of sportive, boyish tricks, to keep Fulvia in good-humour. 
<A NAME="266"></A>As, for example, when Caesar, after his victory in Spain, was on his return, 
<A NAME="267"></A>Antony, among the rest, went out to meet him; and, a rumour being spread 
<A NAME="268"></A>that Caesar was killed and the enemy marching into Italy, he returned to 
<A NAME="269"></A>Rome, and, disguising himself, came to her by night muffled up as a servant 
<A NAME="270"></A>that brought letters from Antony. She, with great impatience, before received 
<A NAME="271"></A>the letter, asks if Antony were well, and instead of an answer he gives 
<A NAME="272"></A>her the letter; and, as she was opening it, took her about the neck and 
<A NAME="273"></A>kissed her. This little story, of many of the same nature, I give as a 
<A NAME="274"></A>specimen.
<A NAME="275"></A><BR><BR>There was nobody of any rank in Rome that did not go some days' 
<A NAME="276"></A>journey to meet Caesar on his return from Spain; but Antony was the best 
<A NAME="277"></A>received of any, admitted to ride the whole journey with him in his carriage, 
<A NAME="278"></A>while behind came Brutus Albinus and Octavian, his niece's son, who afterwards 
<A NAME="279"></A>bore his name and reigned so long over the Romans. Caesar being created, 
<A NAME="280"></A>the fifth time, consul, without delay chose Antony for his colleague, but 
<A NAME="281"></A>designing himself to give up his own consulate to Dolabella, he acquainted 
<A NAME="282"></A>the senate with his resolution. But Antony opposed it with all his might, 
<A NAME="283"></A>saying much that was bad against Dolabella, and receiving the like language 
<A NAME="284"></A>in return, till Caesar could bear with the indecency no longer, and deferred 
<A NAME="285"></A>the matter to another time. Afterwards, when he came before the people 
<A NAME="286"></A>to proclaim Dolabella, Antony cried out that the auspices were unfavourable, 
<A NAME="287"></A>so that at last Caesar, much to Dolabella's vexation, yielded and gave 
<A NAME="288"></A>it up. And it is credible that Caesar was about as much disgusted with 
<A NAME="289"></A>the one as the other. When some one was accusing them both to him, "It 
<A NAME="290"></A>is not," said he, "these well-fed, long-haired men that I fear, but the 
<A NAME="291"></A>pale and the hungry-looking;" meaning Brutus and Cassius, by whose conspiracy 
<A NAME="292"></A>he afterwards fell.
<A NAME="293"></A><BR><BR>And the fairest pretext for that conspiracy was furnished, without 
<A NAME="294"></A>his meaning it, by Antony himself. The Romans were celebrating their festival, 
<A NAME="295"></A>called the Lupercalia, when Caesar, in his triumphal habit, and seated 
<A NAME="296"></A>above the rostra in the market-place, was a spectator of the sports. The 
<A NAME="297"></A>custom is, that many young noblemen and of the magistracy, anointed with 
<A NAME="298"></A>oil and having straps of hide in their hands, run about and strike, in 
<A NAME="299"></A>sport, at every one they meet. Antony was running with the rest; but, omitting 
<A NAME="300"></A>the old ceremony, twining a garland of bay round a diadem, he ran up to 
<A NAME="301"></A>the rostra, and, being lifted up by his companions, would have put it upon 
<A NAME="302"></A>the head of Caesar, as if by that ceremony he was declared king. Caesar 
<A NAME="303"></A>seemingly refused, and drew aside to avoid it, and was applauded by the 
<A NAME="304"></A>people with great shouts. Again Antony pressed it, and again he declined 
<A NAME="305"></A>its acceptance. And so the dispute between them went on for some time, 
<A NAME="306"></A>Antony's solicitations receiving but little encouragement from the shouts 
<A NAME="307"></A>of a few friends, and Caesar's refusal being accompanied with the general 
<A NAME="308"></A>applause of the people; a curious thing enough, that they should submit 
<A NAME="309"></A>with patience to the fact, and yet at the same time dread the name as the 
<A NAME="310"></A>destruction of their liberty. Caesar, very much discomposed at what had 
<A NAME="311"></A>passed got up from his seat, and, laying bare his neck, said he was ready 
<A NAME="312"></A>to receive a stroke, if any one of them desired to give it. The crown was 
<A NAME="313"></A>at last put on one of his statues, but was taken down by some of the tribunes, 
<A NAME="314"></A>who were followed home by the people with shouts of applause. Caesar, however, 
<A NAME="315"></A>resented it, and deposed them.
<A NAME="316"></A><BR><BR>These passages gave great encouragement to Brutus and Cassius, 
<A NAME="317"></A>who in making choice of trusty friends for such an enterprise, were thinking 
<A NAME="318"></A>to engage Antony. The rest approved, except Trebonius, who told them that 
<A NAME="319"></A>Antony and he had lodged and travelled together in the last journey they 
<A NAME="320"></A>took to meet Caesar, and that he had let fall several words, in a cautious 
<A NAME="321"></A>way, on purpose to sound him; that Antony very well understood him, but 
<A NAME="322"></A>did not encourage it; however, he had said nothing of it to Caesar, but 
<A NAME="323"></A>had kept the secret faithfully. The conspirators then proposed that Antony 
<A NAME="324"></A>should die with him, which Brutus would not consent to, insisting that 
<A NAME="325"></A>an action undertaken in defence of right and the laws must be maintained 
<A NAME="326"></A>unsullied, and pure of injustice. It was settled that Antony, whose bodily 
<A NAME="327"></A>strength and high office made him formidable, should, at Caesar's entrance 
<A NAME="328"></A>into the senate, when the deed was to be done, be amused outside by some 
<A NAME="329"></A>of the party in a conversation about some pretended 
<A NAME="330"></A>business.
<A NAME="331"></A><BR><BR>So when all was proceeded with, according to their plan, and Caesar 
<A NAME="332"></A>had fallen in the senate-house, Antony, at the first moment, took a servant's 
<A NAME="333"></A>dress, and hid himself. But, understanding that the conspirators had assembled 
<A NAME="334"></A>in the Capitol, and had no further design upon any one, he persuaded them 
<A NAME="335"></A>to come down, giving them his son as a hostage. That night Cassius supped 
<A NAME="336"></A>at Antony's house, and Brutus with Lepidus. Antony then convened the senate, 
<A NAME="337"></A>and spoke in favour of an act of oblivion, and the appointment of Brutus 
<A NAME="338"></A>and Cassius to provinces. These measures the senate passed; and resolved 
<A NAME="339"></A>that all Caesar's acts should remain in force. Thus Antony went out of 
<A NAME="340"></A>the senate with the highest possible reputation and esteem; for it was 
<A NAME="341"></A>apparent that he had prevented a civil war, and had composed, in the wisest 
<A NAME="342"></A>and most statesmanlike way, questions of the greatest difficulty and embarrassment. 
<A NAME="343"></A>But these temperate counsels were soon swept away by the tide of popular 
<A NAME="344"></A>applause, and the prospect, if Brutus were overthrown, of being without 
<A NAME="345"></A>doubt the ruler-in-chief. As Caesar's body was conveying to the tomb, Antony, 
<A NAME="346"></A>according to the custom, was making his funeral oration in the market-place, 
<A NAME="347"></A>and perceiving the people to be infinitely affected with what he had said, 
<A NAME="348"></A>he began to mingle with his praises language of commiseration, and horror 
<A NAME="349"></A>at what had happened, and, as he was ending his speech, he took the under-clothes 
<A NAME="350"></A>of the dead, and held them up, showing them stains of blood and the holes 
<A NAME="351"></A>of the many stabs, calling those that had done this act villains and bloody 
<A NAME="352"></A>murderers. All which excited the people to such indignation, that they 
<A NAME="353"></A>would not defer the funeral, but, making a pile of tables and forms in 
<A NAME="354"></A>the very market-place, set fire to it; and every one, taking a brand, ran 
<A NAME="355"></A>to the conspirators' houses, to attack them.
<A NAME="356"></A><BR><BR>Upon this, Brutus and his whole party left the city, and Caesar's 
<A NAME="357"></A>friends joined themselves to Antony. Calpurnia, Caesar's wife, lodged with 
<A NAME="358"></A>him the best part of the property to the value of four thousand talents; 
<A NAME="359"></A>he got also into his hands all Caesar's papers wherein were contained journals 
<A NAME="360"></A>of all he had done, and draughts of what he designed to do, which Antony 
<A NAME="361"></A>made good use of; for by this means he appointed what magistrates he pleased, 
<A NAME="362"></A>brought whom he would into the senate, recalled some from exile, freed 
<A NAME="363"></A>others out of prison, and all this as ordered so by Caesar. The Romans, 
<A NAME="364"></A>in mockery, gave those who were thus benefited the name of Charonites, 
<A NAME="365"></A>since, if put to prove their patents, they must have recourse to the papers 
<A NAME="366"></A>of the dead. In short, Antony's behaviour in Rome was very absolute, he 
<A NAME="367"></A>himself being consul and his two brothers in great place; Caius, the one, 
<A NAME="368"></A>being praetor, and Lucius, the other, tribune of the 
<A NAME="369"></A>people.
<A NAME="370"></A><BR><BR>While matters went thus in Rome, the young Caesar, Caesar's niece's 
<A NAME="371"></A>son, and by testament left his heir, arrived at Rome from Apollonia, where 
<A NAME="372"></A>he was when his uncle was killed. The first thing he did was to visit Antony, 
<A NAME="373"></A>as his father's friend. He spoke to him concerning the money that was in 
<A NAME="374"></A>his hands, and reminded him of the legacy Caesar had made of seventy-five 
<A NAME="375"></A>drachmas of every Roman citizen. Antony, at first, laughing at such discourse 
<A NAME="376"></A>from so young a man, told him he wished he were in his health, and that 
<A NAME="377"></A>he wanted good counsel and good friends to tell him the burden of being 
<A NAME="378"></A>executor to Caesar would sit very uneasy upon his young shoulders. This 
<A NAME="379"></A>was no answer to him; and, when he persisted in demanding the property, 
<A NAME="380"></A>Antony went on treating him injuriously both in word and deed, opposed 
<A NAME="381"></A>him when he stood for the tribune's office, and, when he was taking steps 
<A NAME="382"></A>for the dedication of his father's golden chair, as had been enacted, he 
<A NAME="383"></A>threatened to send him to prison if he did not give over soliciting the 
<A NAME="384"></A>people. This made the young Caesar apply himself to Cicero, and all those 
<A NAME="385"></A>that hated Antony; by them he was recommended to the senate, while he himself 
<A NAME="386"></A>courted the people, and drew together the soldiers from their settlements, 
<A NAME="387"></A>till Antony got alarmed, and gave him a meeting in the Capitol, where, 
<A NAME="388"></A>after some words, they came to an accommodation.
<A NAME="389"></A><BR><BR>That night Antony had a very unlucky dream, fancying that his right 
<A NAME="390"></A>hand was thunderstruck. And, some few days after, he was informed that 
<A NAME="391"></A>Caesar was plotting to take his life. Caesar explained, but was not believed, 
<A NAME="392"></A>so that the breach was now made as wide as ever; each of them hurried about 
<A NAME="393"></A>all through Italy to engage, by great offers, the old soldiers that lay 
<A NAME="394"></A>scattered in their settlements, and to be the first to secure the troops 
<A NAME="395"></A>that still remained undischarged. Cicero was at this time the man of greatest 
<A NAME="396"></A>influence in Rome. He made use of all his art to exasperate the people 
<A NAME="397"></A>against Antony, and at length persuaded the senate to declare him a public 
<A NAME="398"></A>enemy, to send Caesar the rods and axes and other marks of honour usually 
<A NAME="399"></A>given to proctors, and to issue orders to Hirtius and Pansa, who were the 
<A NAME="400"></A>consuls, to drive Antony out of Italy. The armies engaged near Modena, 
<A NAME="401"></A>and Caesar himself was present and took part in the battle. Antony was 
<A NAME="402"></A>defeated, but both the consuls were slain. Antony, in his flight, was overtaken 
<A NAME="403"></A>by distresses of every kind, and the worst of all of them was famine. But 
<A NAME="404"></A>it was his character in calamities to be better than at any other time. 
<A NAME="405"></A>Antony, in misfortune, was most nearly a virtuous man. It is common enough 
<A NAME="406"></A>for people, when they fall into great disasters, to discern what is right, 
<A NAME="407"></A>and what they ought to do; but there are but few who in such extremities 
<A NAME="408"></A>have the strength to obey their judgment, either in doing what it approves 
<A NAME="409"></A>or avoiding what it condemns; and a good many are so weak as to give way 
<A NAME="410"></A>to their habits all the more, and are incapable of using their using minds. 
<A NAME="411"></A>Antony, on this occasion, was a most wonderful example to his soldiers. 
<A NAME="412"></A>He, who had just quitted so much luxury and sumptuous living, made no difficulty 
<A NAME="413"></A>now of drinking foul water and feeding on wild fruits and roots. Nay, it 
<A NAME="414"></A>is related they ate the very bark of trees, and, in passing over the Alps, 
<A NAME="415"></A>lived upon creatures that no one before had ever been willing to 
<A NAME="416"></A>touch.
<A NAME="417"></A><BR><BR>The design was to join the army on the other side the Alps, commanded 
<A NAME="418"></A>by Lepidus, who he imagined would stand his friend, he having done him 
<A NAME="419"></A>many good offices with Caesar. On coming up and encamping near at hand, 
<A NAME="420"></A>finding he had no sort of encouragement offered him, he resolved to push 
<A NAME="421"></A>his fortune and venture all. His hair was long and disordered, nor had 
<A NAME="422"></A>he shaved his beard since his defeat; in this guise, and with a dark coloured 
<A NAME="423"></A>cloak flung over him, he came into the trenches of Lepidus, and began to 
<A NAME="424"></A>address the army. Some were moved at his habit, others at his words, so 
<A NAME="425"></A>that Lepidus, not liking it, ordered the trumpets to sound, that he might 
<A NAME="426"></A>be heard no longer. This raised in the soldiers yet a greater pity, so 
<A NAME="427"></A>that they resolved to confer secretly with him, and dressed Laelius and 
<A NAME="428"></A>Clodius in women's clothes, and sent them to see him. They advised him 
<A NAME="429"></A>without delay to attack Lepidus's trenches, assuring him that a strong 
<A NAME="430"></A>party would receive him, and, if he wished it, would kill Lepidus. Antony, 
<A NAME="431"></A>however, had no wish for this, but next morning marched his army to pass 
<A NAME="432"></A>over the river that parted the two camps. He was himself the first man 
<A NAME="433"></A>that stepped in, and, as he went through towards the other bank, he saw 
<A NAME="434"></A>Lepidus's soldiers in great numbers reaching out their hands to help him, 
<A NAME="435"></A>and beating down the works to make him way. Being entered into the camp, 
<A NAME="436"></A>and finding himself absolute master, he nevertheless treated Lepidus with 
<A NAME="437"></A>the greatest civility, and gave him the title of Father, when he spoke 
<A NAME="438"></A>to him, and though he had everything at his own command, he left him the 
<A NAME="439"></A>honour of being called the general. This fair usage brought over to him 
<A NAME="440"></A>Munatius Plancus, who was not far off with a considerable force. Thus in 
<A NAME="441"></A>great strength he repassed the Alps, leading with him into Italy seventeen 
<A NAME="442"></A>legions and ten thousand horse, besides six legions which he left in garrison 
<A NAME="443"></A>under the command of Varius, one of his familiar friends and boon companions, 
<A NAME="444"></A>whom they used to call by the nickname of Cotylon.
<A NAME="445"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, perceiving that Cicero's wishes were for liberty, had ceased 
<A NAME="446"></A>to pay any further regard to him, and was now employing the mediation of 
<A NAME="447"></A>his friends to come to a good understanding with Antony. They both met 
<A NAME="448"></A>together with Lepidus in a small island, where the conference lasted three 
<A NAME="449"></A>days. The empire was soon determined of, it being divided amongst them 
<A NAME="450"></A>as if it had been their paternal inheritance. That which gave them all 
<A NAME="451"></A>the trouble was to agree who should be put to death, each of them desiring 
<A NAME="452"></A>to destroy his enemies and to save his friends. But, in the end, animosity 
<A NAME="453"></A>to those they hated carried the day against respect for relations and affection 
<A NAME="454"></A>for friends; and Caesar sacrificed Cicero to Antony, Antony gave up his 
<A NAME="455"></A>uncle Lucius Caesar, and Lepidus received permission to murder his brother 
<A NAME="456"></A>Paulus, or, as others say, yielded his brother to them. I do not believe 
<A NAME="457"></A>anything ever took place more truly savage or barbarous than this composition, 
<A NAME="458"></A>for, in this exchange of blood for blood, they were guilty of the lives 
<A NAME="459"></A>they surrendered and of those they took; or, indeed, more guilty in the 
<A NAME="460"></A>case of their friends for whose deaths they had not even the justification 
<A NAME="461"></A>of hatred. To complete the reconciliation, the soldiery, coming about them, 
<A NAME="462"></A>demanded that confirmation should be given to it by some alliance of marriage; 
<A NAME="463"></A>Caesar should marry Clodia, the daughter of Fulvia, wife to Antony. This 
<A NAME="464"></A>also being agreed to, three hundred persons were put to death by proscription. 
<A NAME="465"></A>Antony gave orders to those that were to kill Cicero to cut off his head 
<A NAME="466"></A>and right hand, with which he had written his invectives against him; and, 
<A NAME="467"></A>when they were brought before him, he regarded them joyfully, actually 
<A NAME="468"></A>bursting out more than once into laughter, and, when he had satiated himself 
<A NAME="469"></A>with the sight of them, ordered them to be hung up above the speaker's 
<A NAME="470"></A>place in the forum, thinking thus to insult the dead, while in fact he 
<A NAME="471"></A>only exposed his own wanton arrogance, and his unworthiness to hold the 
<A NAME="472"></A>power that fortune had given him. His uncle, Lucius Caesar, being closely 
<A NAME="473"></A>pursued, took refuge with his sister, who, when the murderers had broken 
<A NAME="474"></A>into her house and were pressing into her chamber, met them at the door, 
<A NAME="475"></A>and spreading out hands, cried out several times. "You shall not kill Lucius 
<A NAME="476"></A>Caesar till you first despatch me who gave your general his birth;" and 
<A NAME="477"></A>in this manner she succeeded in getting her brother out of the way, and 
<A NAME="478"></A>saving his life.
<A NAME="479"></A><BR><BR>This triumvirate was very hateful to the Romans, and Antony most 
<A NAME="480"></A>of all bore the blame, because he was older than Caesar, and had greater 
<A NAME="481"></A>authority than Lepidus, and withal he was no sooner settled in his affairs, 
<A NAME="482"></A>but he turned to his luxurious and dissolute way of living. Besides the 
<A NAME="483"></A>ill reputation he gained by his general behaviour, it was some considerable 
<A NAME="484"></A>disadvantage to him his living in the house of Pompey the Great, who had 
<A NAME="485"></A>been as much admired for his temperance and his sober, citizen-like habits 
<A NAME="486"></A>of life, as ever he was for having triumphed three times. They could not 
<A NAME="487"></A>without anger see the doors of that house shut against magistrates, officers, 
<A NAME="488"></A>and envoys, who were shamefully refused admittance, while it was filled 
<A NAME="489"></A>inside with players, jugglers, and drunken flatterers, upon whom were spent 
<A NAME="490"></A>the greatest part of the wealth which violence and cruelty procured. For 
<A NAME="491"></A>they did not limit themselves to the forfeiture of the estates of such 
<A NAME="492"></A>as were proscribed, defrauding the widows and families, nor were they contented 
<A NAME="493"></A>with laying on every possible kind of tax and imposition; but hearing that 
<A NAME="494"></A>several sums of money were, as well by strangers as citizens of Rome, deposited 
<A NAME="495"></A>in the hands of the vestal virgins, they went and took the money away by 
<A NAME="496"></A>force. When it was manifest that nothing would ever be enough for Antony, 
<A NAME="497"></A>Caesar at last called for a division of property. The army was also divided 
<A NAME="498"></A>between them, upon their march into Macedonia to make war with Brutus and 
<A NAME="499"></A>Cassius, Lepidus being left with the command of the 
<A NAME="500"></A>city.
<A NAME="501"></A><BR><BR>However, after they had crossed the sea and engaged in operations 
<A NAME="502"></A>of war, encamping in front of the enemy, Antony opposite Cassius, and Caesar 
<A NAME="503"></A>opposite Brutus, Caesar did nothing worth relating, and all the success 
<A NAME="504"></A>and victory were Antony's. In the first battle, Caesar was completely routed 
<A NAME="505"></A>by Brutus, his camp taken, he himself very narrowly escaping by flight. 
<A NAME="506"></A>As he himself writes in his Memoirs, he retired before the battle, on account 
<A NAME="507"></A>of a dream which one of his friends had. But Antony, on the other hand, 
<A NAME="508"></A>defeated Cassius; though some have written that he was not actually present 
<A NAME="509"></A>in the engagement, and only joined afterwards in the pursuit. Cassius was 
<A NAME="510"></A>killed, at his own entreaty and order, by one of his most trusted freedmen, 
<A NAME="511"></A>Pindarus, not being aware of Brutus's victory. After a few days' interval, 
<A NAME="512"></A>they fought another battle, in which Brutus lost the day, and slew himself; 
<A NAME="513"></A>and Caesar being sick, Antony had almost all the honour of the victory. 
<A NAME="514"></A>Standing over Brutus's dead body, he uttered a few words of reproach upon 
<A NAME="515"></A>him for the death of his brother Caius, who had been executed by Brutus's 
<A NAME="516"></A>order in Macedonia in revenge of Cicero; but, saying presently that Hortensius 
<A NAME="517"></A>was most to blame for it, he gave order for his being slain upon his brother's 
<A NAME="518"></A>tomb, and, throwing his own scarlet mantle, which was of great value, upon 
<A NAME="519"></A>the body of Brutus, he gave charge to one of his own freedmen to take care 
<A NAME="520"></A>of his funeral. This man, as Antony came to understand, did not leave the 
<A NAME="521"></A>mantle with the corpse, but kept both it and a good part of the money that 
<A NAME="522"></A>should have been spent in the funeral for himself; for which he had him 
<A NAME="523"></A>put to death.
<A NAME="524"></A><BR><BR>But Caesar was conveyed to Rome, no one expecting that he would 
<A NAME="525"></A>long survive. Antony, purposing to go to the eastern provinces to lay them 
<A NAME="526"></A>under contribution, entered Greece with a large force. The promise had 
<A NAME="527"></A>been made that every common soldier should receive for his pay five thousand 
<A NAME="528"></A>drachmas; so it was likely there would be need of pretty severe taxing 
<A NAME="529"></A>and levying to raise money. However, to the Greeks he showed at first reason 
<A NAME="530"></A>and moderation enough; he gratified his love of amusement by hearing the 
<A NAME="531"></A>learned men dispute, by seeing the games, and undergoing initiation; and 
<A NAME="532"></A>in judicial matters he was equitable, taking pleasure in being styled a 
<A NAME="533"></A>lover of Greece, but, above all, in being called a lover of Athens, to 
<A NAME="534"></A>which city he made very considerable presents. The people of Megara wished 
<A NAME="535"></A>to let him know that they also had something to show him, and invited him 
<A NAME="536"></A>to come and see their senate-house. So he went and examined it, and on 
<A NAME="537"></A>their asking him how he liked it, told them it was "not very large, but 
<A NAME="538"></A>extremely ruinous." At the same time, he had a survey made of the temple 
<A NAME="539"></A>of the Pythian Apollo as if he had designed to repair it, and indeed he 
<A NAME="540"></A>had declared to the senate his intention so to do.
<A NAME="541"></A><BR><BR>However, leaving Lucius Censorinus in Greece, he crossed over into 
<A NAME="542"></A>Asia, and there laid his hands on the stores of accumulated wealth, while 
<A NAME="543"></A>kings waited at his door, and queens were rivalling one another, who should 
<A NAME="544"></A>make him the greatest presents or appear most charming in his eyes. Thus, 
<A NAME="545"></A>whilst Caesar in Rome was wearing out his strength amidst seditions and 
<A NAME="546"></A>wars, Antony, with nothing to do amidst the enjoyments of peace, let his 
<A NAME="547"></A>passions carry him easily back to the old course of life that was familiar 
<A NAME="548"></A>to him. A set of harpers and pipers, Anaxenor and Xuthus, the dancing-man, 
<A NAME="549"></A>Metrodorus, and a whole Bacchic rout of the like Asiatic exhibitors, far 
<A NAME="550"></A>outdoing in licence and buffoonery the pests that had followed him out 
<A NAME="551"></A>of Italy, came in and possessed the court; the thing was past patience, 
<A NAME="552"></A>wealth of all kinds being wasted on objects like these. The whole of Asia 
<A NAME="553"></A>was like the city in Sophocles, loaded, at one time-
<A NAME="554"></A><BR><BR>"---------with incense in the air,
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>Jubilant songs, and outcries of despair."
<A NAME="556"></A><BR><BR>When he made his entry into Ephesus, the women met him dressed 
<A NAME="557"></A>up like Bacchantes, and the men and boys like satyrs and fauns, and throughout 
<A NAME="558"></A>the town nothing was to be seen but spears wreathed about with ivy, harps, 
<A NAME="559"></A>flutes, and psalteries, while Antony in their songs was Bacchus, the Giver 
<A NAME="560"></A>of joy, and the Gentle. And so indeed he was to some but to far more the 
<A NAME="561"></A>Devourer and the Savage; for he would deprive persons of worth and quality 
<A NAME="562"></A>of their fortunes to gratify villains and flatterers, who would sometimes 
<A NAME="563"></A>beg the estates of men yet living, pretending they were dead, and, obtaining 
<A NAME="564"></A>a grant, take possession. He gave his cook the house of a Magnesian citizen, 
<A NAME="565"></A>as a reward for a single highly successful supper, and, at last, when he 
<A NAME="566"></A>was proceeding to lay a second whole tribute on Asia, Hybreas, speaking 
<A NAME="567"></A>on behalf of the cities, took courage, and told him broadly, but aptly 
<A NAME="568"></A>enough for Antony's taste "if you can take two yearly tributes, you can 
<A NAME="569"></A>doubtless give us a couple of summers and a double harvest time;" and put 
<A NAME="570"></A>it to him in the plainest and boldest way, that Asia had raised two hundred 
<A NAME="571"></A>thousand talents for his service: "If this has not been paid to you, ask 
<A NAME="572"></A>your collectors for it; if it has, and is all gone, we are ruined men." 
<A NAME="573"></A>These words touched Antony to the quick, who was simply ignorant of most 
<A NAME="574"></A>things that were done in his name; not that he was so indolent, as he was 
<A NAME="575"></A>prone to trust frankly in all about him. For there was much simplicity 
<A NAME="576"></A>in his character; he was slow to see his faults, but when he did see them, 
<A NAME="577"></A>was extremely repentant, and ready to ask pardon of those he had injured 
<A NAME="578"></A>prodigal in his acts of reparation, and severe in his punishments, but 
<A NAME="579"></A>his generosity was much more extravagant than his severity; his raillery 
<A NAME="580"></A>was sharp and insulting, but the edge of it was taken off by his readiness 
<A NAME="581"></A>to submit to any kind of repartee; for he was as well contented to be rallied, 
<A NAME="582"></A>as he was pleased to rally others. And this freedom of speech was, indeed, 
<A NAME="583"></A>the cause of many of his disasters. He never imagined those who used so 
<A NAME="584"></A>much liberty in their mirth would flatter or deceive him in business of 
<A NAME="585"></A>consequence, not knowing how common it is with parasites to mix their flattery 
<A NAME="586"></A>with boldness, as confectioners do their sweetmeats with something biting, 
<A NAME="587"></A>to prevent the sense of satiety. Their freedoms and impertinences at table 
<A NAME="588"></A>were designed expressly to give to their obsequiousness in council the 
<A NAME="589"></A>air of being not complaisance, but conviction.
<A NAME="590"></A><BR><BR>Such being his temper, the last and crowning mischief that could 
<A NAME="591"></A>befall him came in the love of Cleopatra, to awaken and kindle to fury 
<A NAME="592"></A>passions that as yet lay still and dormant in his nature, and to stifle 
<A NAME="593"></A>and finally corrupt any elements that yet made resistance in him of goodness 
<A NAME="594"></A>and a sound judgment. He fell into the snare thus. When making preparation 
<A NAME="595"></A>for the Parthian war, he sent to command her to make her personal appearance 
<A NAME="596"></A>in Cilicia, to answer an accusation that she had given great assistance, 
<A NAME="597"></A>in the late wars, to Cassius. Dellius, who was sent on this message, had 
<A NAME="598"></A>no sooner seen her face, and remarked her adroitness and subtlety in speech, 
<A NAME="599"></A>but he felt convinced that Antony would not so much as think of giving 
<A NAME="600"></A>any molestation to a woman like this; on the contrary, she would be the 
<A NAME="601"></A>first in favour with him. So he set himself at once to pay his court to 
<A NAME="602"></A>the Egyptian, and gave her his advice, "to go," in the Homeric style, to 
<A NAME="603"></A>Cilicia, "in her best attire," and bade her fear nothing from Antony, the 
<A NAME="604"></A>gentlest and kindest of soldiers. She had some faith in the words of Dellius, 
<A NAME="605"></A>but more in her own attractions; which, having formerly recommended her 
<A NAME="606"></A>to Caesar and the young Cnaeus Pompey, she did not doubt might prove yet 
<A NAME="607"></A>more successful with Antony. Their acquaintance was with her when a girl, 
<A NAME="608"></A>young and ignorant of the world, but she was to meet Antony in the time 
<A NAME="609"></A>of life when women's beauty is most splendid, and their intellects are 
<A NAME="610"></A>in full maturity. She made great preparation for her journey, of money, 
<A NAME="611"></A>gifts, and ornaments of value, such as so wealthy a kingdom might afford, 
<A NAME="612"></A>but she brought with her her surest hopes in her own magic arts and 
<A NAME="613"></A>charms.
<A NAME="614"></A><BR><BR>She received several letters, both from Antony and from his friends, 
<A NAME="615"></A>to summon her, but she took no account of these orders; and at last, as 
<A NAME="616"></A>if in mockery of them, she came sailing up the river Cydnus, in a barge 
<A NAME="617"></A>with gilded stern and outspread sails of purple, while oars of silver beat 
<A NAME="618"></A>time to the music of flutes and fifes and harps. She herself lay all along 
<A NAME="619"></A>under a canopy of cloth of gold, dressed as Venus in a picture, and beautiful 
<A NAME="620"></A>young boys, like painted Cupids, stood on each side to fan her. Her maids 
<A NAME="621"></A>were dressed like sea nymphs and graces, some steering at the rudder, some 
<A NAME="622"></A>working at the ropes. The perfumes diffused themselves from the vessel 
<A NAME="623"></A>to the shore, which was covered with multitudes, part following the galley 
<A NAME="624"></A>up the river on either bank, part running out of the city to see the sight. 
<A NAME="625"></A>The market-place was quite emptied, and Antony at last was left alone sitting 
<A NAME="626"></A>upon the tribunal; while the word went through all the multitude, that 
<A NAME="627"></A>Venus was come to feast with Bacchus, for the common good of Asia. On her 
<A NAME="628"></A>arrival, Antony sent to invite her to supper. She thought it fitter he 
<A NAME="629"></A>should come to her; so, willing to show his good-humour and courtesy, he 
<A NAME="630"></A>complied, and went. He found the preparations to receive him magnificent 
<A NAME="631"></A>beyond expression, but nothing so admirable as the great number of lights; 
<A NAME="632"></A>for on a sudden there was let down altogether so great a number of branches 
<A NAME="633"></A>with lights in them so ingeniously disposed, some in squares, and some 
<A NAME="634"></A>in circles, that the whole thing was a spectacle that has seldom been equalled 
<A NAME="635"></A>for beauty.
<A NAME="636"></A><BR><BR>The next day, Antony invited her to supper, and was very desirous 
<A NAME="637"></A>to outdo her as well in magnificence as contrivance; but he found he was 
<A NAME="638"></A>altogether beaten in both, and was so well convinced of it that he was 
<A NAME="639"></A>himself the first to jest and mock at his poverty of wit and his rustic 
<A NAME="640"></A>awkwardness. She, perceiving that his raillery was broad and gross, and 
<A NAME="641"></A>savoured more of the soldier than the courtier, rejoined in the same taste, 
<A NAME="642"></A>and fell into it at once, without any sort of reluctance or reserve. For 
<A NAME="643"></A>her actual beauty, it is said, was not in itself so remarkable that none 
<A NAME="644"></A>could be compared with her, or that no one could see her without being 
<A NAME="645"></A>struck by it, but the contact of her presence, if you lived with her, was 
<A NAME="646"></A>irresistible; the attraction of her person, joining with the charm of her 
<A NAME="647"></A>conversation, and the character that attended all she said or did, was 
<A NAME="648"></A>something bewitching. It was a pleasure merely to hear the sound of her 
<A NAME="649"></A>voice, with which, like an instrument of many strings, she could pass from 
<A NAME="650"></A>one language to another; so that there were few of the barbarian nations 
<A NAME="651"></A>that she answered by an interpreter; to most of them she spoke herself, 
<A NAME="652"></A>as to the Ethiopians, Troglodytes, Hebrews, Arabians, Syrians, Medes, Parthians, 
<A NAME="653"></A>and many others, whose language she had learnt; which was all the more 
<A NAME="654"></A>surprising because most of the kings, her predecessors, scarcely gave themselves 
<A NAME="655"></A>the trouble to acquire the Egyptian tongue, and several of them quite abandoned 
<A NAME="656"></A>the Macedonian.
<A NAME="657"></A><BR><BR>Antony was so captivated by her that, while Fulvia his wife maintained 
<A NAME="658"></A>his quarrels in Rome against Caesar by actual force of arms, and the Parthian 
<A NAME="659"></A>troops, commanded by Labienus (the king's generals having made him commander-in-chief), 
<A NAME="660"></A>were assembled in Mesopotamia, and ready to enter Syria, he could yet suffer 
<A NAME="661"></A>himself to be carried away by her to Alexandria, there to keep holiday, 
<A NAME="662"></A>like a boy, in play and diversion, squandering and fooling away in enjoyments 
<A NAME="663"></A>that most costly, as Antiphon says, of all valuables, time. They had a 
<A NAME="664"></A>sort of company, to which they gave a particular name, calling it that 
<A NAME="665"></A>of the Inimitable Livers. The members entertained one another daily in 
<A NAME="666"></A>turn, with all extravagance of expenditure beyond measure or belief. Philotas, 
<A NAME="667"></A>a physician of Amphissa, who was at that time a student of medicine in 
<A NAME="668"></A>Alexandria, used to tell my grandfather Lamprias that, having some acquaintance 
<A NAME="669"></A>with one of the royal cooks, he was invited by him, being a young man, 
<A NAME="670"></A>to come and see the sumptuous preparations for supper. So he was taken 
<A NAME="671"></A>into the kitchen, where he admired the prodigious variety of all things; 
<A NAME="672"></A>but particularly, seeing eight wild boars roasting whole, says he, "Surely 
<A NAME="673"></A>you have a great number of guests." The cook laughed at his simplicity, 
<A NAME="674"></A>and told him there were not above twelve to sup, but that every dish was 
<A NAME="675"></A>to be served up just roasted to a turn, and if anything was but one minute 
<A NAME="676"></A>ill-timed, it was spoiled; "And," said he, "maybe Antony will sup just 
<A NAME="677"></A>now, maybe not this hour, maybe he will call for wine, or begin to talk, 
<A NAME="678"></A>and will put it off. So that," he continued, "it is not one, but many suppers 
<A NAME="679"></A>must be had in readiness, as it is impossible to guess at his hour." This 
<A NAME="680"></A>was Philotas's story; who related besides, that he afterwards came to be 
<A NAME="681"></A>one the medical attendants of Antony's eldest son by Fulvia, and used to 
<A NAME="682"></A>be invited pretty often, among other companions, to his table, when he 
<A NAME="683"></A>was not supping with his father. One day another physician had talked loudly, 
<A NAME="684"></A>and given great disturbance to the company, whose mouth Philotas stopped 
<A NAME="685"></A>with this sophistical syllogism: "In some states of fever the patient should 
<A NAME="686"></A>take cold water; every one who has a fever is in some state of fever; therefore 
<A NAME="687"></A>in a fever cold water should always be taken." The man was quite struck 
<A NAME="688"></A>dumb, and Antony's son, very much pleased, laughed aloud, and said, "Philotas, 
<A NAME="689"></A>I make you a present of all you see there," pointing to a sideboard covered 
<A NAME="690"></A>with plate. Philotas thanked him much, but was far enough from ever imagining 
<A NAME="691"></A>that a boy of his age could dispose of things of that value. Soon after, 
<A NAME="692"></A>however, the plate was all brought to him, and he was desired to get his 
<A NAME="693"></A>mark upon it; and when he put it away from him, and was afraid to accept 
<A NAME="694"></A>the present. "What ails the man?" said he that brought it; "do you know 
<A NAME="695"></A>that he who gives you this is Antony's son, who is free to give it, if 
<A NAME="696"></A>it were all gold? but if you will be advised by me, I would counsel you 
<A NAME="697"></A>to accept of the value in money from us; for there may be amongst the rest 
<A NAME="698"></A>some antique or famous piece of workmanship, which Antony would be sorry 
<A NAME="699"></A>to part with." These anecdotes, my grandfather told us, Philotas used frequently 
<A NAME="700"></A>to relate.
<A NAME="701"></A><BR><BR>To return to Cleopatra; Plato admits four sorts of flattery, but 
<A NAME="702"></A>she had a thousand. Were Antony serious or disposed to mirth, she had at 
<A NAME="703"></A>any moment some new delight or charm to meet his wishes; at every turn 
<A NAME="704"></A>she was upon him, and let him escape her neither by day nor by night. She 
<A NAME="705"></A>played at dice with him, drank with him, hunted with him; and when he exercised 
<A NAME="706"></A>in arms, she was there to see. At night she would go rambling with him 
<A NAME="707"></A>to disturb and torment people at their doors and windows, dressed like 
<A NAME="708"></A>a servant-woman, for Antony also went in servant's disguise, and from these 
<A NAME="709"></A>expeditions he often came home very scurvily answered, and sometimes even 
<A NAME="710"></A>beaten severely, though most people guessed who it was. However, the Alexandrians 
<A NAME="711"></A>in general liked it all well enough, and joined good-humouredly and kindly 
<A NAME="712"></A>in his frolic and play, saying they were much obliged to Antony for acting 
<A NAME="713"></A>his tragic parts at Rome, and keeping comedy for them. It would be trifling 
<A NAME="714"></A>without end to be particular in his follies, but his fishing must not be 
<A NAME="715"></A>forgotten. He went out one day to angle with Cleopatra, and, being so unfortunate 
<A NAME="716"></A>as to catch nothing in the presence of his mistress, he gave secret orders 
<A NAME="717"></A>to the fishermen to dive under water, and put fishes that had been already 
<A NAME="718"></A>taken upon his hooks; and these he drew so fast that the Egyptian perceived 
<A NAME="719"></A>it. But, feigning great admiration, she told everybody how dexterous Antony 
<A NAME="720"></A>was, and invited them next day to come and see him again. So, when a number 
<A NAME="721"></A>of them had come on board the fishing-boats, as soon as he had let down 
<A NAME="722"></A>his hook, one of her servants was beforehand with his divers and fixed 
<A NAME="723"></A>upon his hook a salted fish from Pontus. Antony, feeling his line give, 
<A NAME="724"></A>drew up the prey, and when, as may be imagined, great laughter ensued, 
<A NAME="725"></A>"Leave," said Cleopatra, "the fishing-rod, general, to us poor sovereigns 
<A NAME="726"></A>of Pharos and Canopus; your game is cities, provinces, and 
<A NAME="727"></A>kingdoms."
<A NAME="728"></A><BR><BR>Whilst he was thus diverting himself and engaged in this boy's 
<A NAME="729"></A>play, two despatches arrived; one from Rome, that his brother Lucius and 
<A NAME="730"></A>his wife Fulvia, after many quarrels among themselves, had joined in war 
<A NAME="731"></A>against Caesar, and having lost all, had fled out of Italy; the other bringing 
<A NAME="732"></A>little better news, that Labienus, at the head of the Parthians, was overrunning 
<A NAME="733"></A>Asia, from Euphrates and Syria as far as Lydia and Ionia. So, scarcely 
<A NAME="734"></A>at last rousing himself from sleep, and shaking off the fumes of wine, 
<A NAME="735"></A>he set out to attack the Parthians, and went as far as Phoenicia; but, 
<A NAME="736"></A>upon the receipt of lamentable letters from Fulvia, turned his course with 
<A NAME="737"></A>two hundred ships to Italy. And, in his way, receiving such of his friends 
<A NAME="738"></A>as fled from Italy, he was given to understand that Fulvia was the sole 
<A NAME="739"></A>cause of the war, a woman of a restless spirit and very bold, and withal 
<A NAME="740"></A>her hopes were that commotions in Italy would force Antony from Cleopatra. 
<A NAME="741"></A>But it happened that Fulvia as she was coming to meet her husband, fell 
<A NAME="742"></A>sick by the way, and died at Sicyon, so that an accommodation was the more 
<A NAME="743"></A>easily made. For when he reached Italy, and Caesar showed no intention 
<A NAME="744"></A>of laying anything to his charge, and he on his part shifted the blame 
<A NAME="745"></A>of everything on Fulvia, those that were friends to them would not suffer 
<A NAME="746"></A>that the time should be spent in looking narrowly into the plea, but made 
<A NAME="747"></A>a reconciliation first, and then a partition of the empire between them, 
<A NAME="748"></A>taking as their boundary the Ionian Sea, the eastern provinces falling 
<A NAME="749"></A>to Antony, to Caesar the western, and Africa being left to Lepidus. And 
<A NAME="750"></A>an agreement was made that everyone in their turn, as they thought fit, 
<A NAME="751"></A>should make their friends consuls, when they did not choose to take the 
<A NAME="752"></A>offices themselves.
<A NAME="753"></A><BR><BR>These terms were well approved of, but yet it was thought some 
<A NAME="754"></A>closer tie would be desirable; and for this, fortune offered occasion. 
<A NAME="755"></A>Caesar had an elder sister, not of the whole blood, for Attia was his mother's 
<A NAME="756"></A>name, hers Ancharia. This sister, Octavia, he was extremely attached to, 
<A NAME="757"></A>as indeed she was, it is said, quite a wonder of a woman. Her husband, 
<A NAME="758"></A>Caius Marcellus, had died not long before, and Antony was now a widower 
<A NAME="759"></A>by the death of Fulvia; for, though he did not disavow the passion he had 
<A NAME="760"></A>for Cleopatra, yet he disowned anything of marriage, reason as yet, upon 
<A NAME="761"></A>this point, still maintaining the debate against the charms of the Egyptian. 
<A NAME="762"></A>Everybody concurred in promoting this new alliance, fully expecting that 
<A NAME="763"></A>with the beauty, honour, and prudence of Octavia, when her company should, 
<A NAME="764"></A>as it was certain it would, have engaged his affections, all would be kept 
<A NAME="765"></A>in the safe and happy course of friendship. So, both parties being agreed, 
<A NAME="766"></A>they went to Rome to celebrate the nuptials, the senate dispensing with 
<A NAME="767"></A>the law by which a widow was not permitted to marry till ten months after 
<A NAME="768"></A>the death of her husband.
<A NAME="769"></A><BR><BR>Sextus Pompeius was in possession of Sicily, and with his ships, 
<A NAME="770"></A>under the command of Menas, the pirate, and Menecrates, so infested the 
<A NAME="771"></A>Italian coast that no vessels durst venture into those seas. Sextus had 
<A NAME="772"></A>behaved with much humanity towards Antony, having received his mother when 
<A NAME="773"></A>she fled with Fulvia, and it was therefore judged fit that he also should 
<A NAME="774"></A>be received into the peace. They met near the promontory of Misenum, by 
<A NAME="775"></A>the mole of the port, Pompey having his fleet at anchor close by, and Antony 
<A NAME="776"></A>and Caesar their troops drawn up all along the shore. There it was concluded 
<A NAME="777"></A>that Sextus should quietly enjoy the government of Sicily and Sardinia, 
<A NAME="778"></A>he conditioning to scour the seas of all pirates, and to send so much corn 
<A NAME="779"></A>every year to Rome.
<A NAME="780"></A><BR><BR>This agreed on, they invited one another to supper, and by lot 
<A NAME="781"></A>it fell to Pompey's turn to give the first entertainment, and Antony, asking 
<A NAME="782"></A>where it was to be, "There," said he, pointing to the admiral-galley, a 
<A NAME="783"></A>ship of six banks of oars. "that is the only house that Pompey is heir 
<A NAME="784"></A>to of his father's." And this he said, reflecting upon Antony, who was 
<A NAME="785"></A>then in possession of his father's house. Having fixed the ship on her 
<A NAME="786"></A>anchors, and formed a bridgeway from the promontory to conduct on board 
<A NAME="787"></A>of her, he gave them a cordial welcome. And when they began to grow warm, 
<A NAME="788"></A>and jests were passing freely on Antony and Cleopatra's loves, Menas, the 
<A NAME="789"></A>pirate, whispered Pompey, in the ear, "Shall I," said he, "cut the cables 
<A NAME="790"></A>and make you master not of Sicily only and Sardinia, but of the whole Roman 
<A NAME="791"></A>empire?" Pompey, having considered a little while, returned him answer, 
<A NAME="792"></A>"Menas, this might have been done without acquainting me; now we must rest 
<A NAME="793"></A>content; I do not break my word." And so, having been entertained by the 
<A NAME="794"></A>other two in their turns, he set sail for Sicily.
<A NAME="795"></A><BR><BR>After the treaty was completed, Antony despatched Ventidius into 
<A NAME="796"></A>Asia, to check the advance of the Parthians, while he, as a compliment 
<A NAME="797"></A>to Caesar, accepted the office of priest to the deceased Caesar. And in 
<A NAME="798"></A>any state affair and matter of consequence, they both behaved themselves 
<A NAME="799"></A>with much consideration and friendliness for each other. But it annoyed 
<A NAME="800"></A>Antony that in all their amusements, on any trial of skill or fortune, 
<A NAME="801"></A>Caesar should be constantly victorious. He had with him an Egyptian diviner, 
<A NAME="802"></A>one of those who calculate nativities, who, either to make his court to 
<A NAME="803"></A>Cleopatra, or that by the rules of his art he found it to be so, openly 
<A NAME="804"></A>declared to him that though the fortune that attended him was bright and 
<A NAME="805"></A>glorious, yet it was overshadowed by Caesar's; and advised him to keep 
<A NAME="806"></A>himself as far distant as he could from that young man; "for your Genius," 
<A NAME="807"></A>said he, "dreads his; when absent from him yours is proud and brave, but 
<A NAME="808"></A>in his presence unmanly and dejected;" and incidents that occurred appeared 
<A NAME="809"></A>to show that the Egyptian spoke truth. For whenever they cast lots for 
<A NAME="810"></A>any playful purpose, or threw dice, Antony was still the loser; and when 
<A NAME="811"></A>they fought game-cocks or quails, Caesar's had the victory. This gave Antony 
<A NAME="812"></A>a secret displeasure, and made him put the more confidence in the skill 
<A NAME="813"></A>of his Egyptian. So, leaving the management of his home affairs to Caesar, 
<A NAME="814"></A>he left Italy, and took Octavia, who had lately borne him a daughter, along 
<A NAME="815"></A>with him into Greece.
<A NAME="816"></A><BR><BR>Here, whilst he wintered in Athens, he received the first news 
<A NAME="817"></A>of Ventidius's successes over the Parthians, of his having defeated them 
<A NAME="818"></A>in a battle, having slain Labienus and Pharnapates, the best general their 
<A NAME="819"></A>king, Hyrodes, possessed. For the celebrating of which he made public feast 
<A NAME="820"></A>through Greece, and for the prizes which were contested at Athens he himself 
<A NAME="821"></A>acted as steward, and, leaving at home the ensigns that are carried before 
<A NAME="822"></A>the general, he made his public appearance in a gown and white shoes, with 
<A NAME="823"></A>the steward's wands marching before; and he performed his duty in taking 
<A NAME="824"></A>the combatants by the neck, to part them, when they had fought 
<A NAME="825"></A>enough.
<A NAME="826"></A><BR><BR>When the time came for him to set out for the war, he took a garland 
<A NAME="827"></A>from the sacred olive, and, in obedience to some oracle, he filled a vessel 
<A NAME="828"></A>with the water of the Clepsydra to carry along with him. In this interval, 
<A NAME="829"></A>Pacorus, the Parthian king's son, who was marching into Syria with a large 
<A NAME="830"></A>army, was met by Ventidius, who gave him battle in the country of Cyrrhestica, 
<A NAME="831"></A>slew a large number of his men, and Pacorus among the first. This victory 
<A NAME="832"></A>was one of the most renowned achievements of the Romans, and fully avenged 
<A NAME="833"></A>their defeats under Crassus, the Parthians being obliged, after the loss 
<A NAME="834"></A>of three battles successively, to keep themselves within the bounds of 
<A NAME="835"></A>Media and Mesopotamia. Ventidius was not willing to push his good fortune 
<A NAME="836"></A>further, for fear of raising some jealousy in Antony, but turning his aims 
<A NAME="837"></A>against those that had quitted the Roman interest, he reduced them to their 
<A NAME="838"></A>former obedience. Among the rest, he besieged Antiochus, King of Commagene, 
<A NAME="839"></A>in the city of Samosata, who made an offer of a thousand talents for his 
<A NAME="840"></A>pardon, and a promise of submission to Antony's commands. But Ventidius 
<A NAME="841"></A>told him that he must send to Antony, who was already on his march, and 
<A NAME="842"></A>had sent word to Ventidius to make no terms with Antiochus, wishing that 
<A NAME="843"></A>at any rate this one exploit might be ascribed to him, and that people 
<A NAME="844"></A>might not think that all his successes were won by his lieutenants. The 
<A NAME="845"></A>siege, however, was long protracted; for when those within found their 
<A NAME="846"></A>offers refused, they defended themselves stoutly, till, at last, Antony, 
<A NAME="847"></A>finding he was doing nothing, in shame and regret for having refused the 
<A NAME="848"></A>first offer, was glad to make an accommodation with Antiochus for three 
<A NAME="849"></A>hundred talents. And, having given some orders for the affairs of Syria, 
<A NAME="850"></A>he returned to Athens; and, paying Ventidius the honours he well deserved, 
<A NAME="851"></A>dismissed him to receive his triumph. He is the only man that has ever 
<A NAME="852"></A>yet triumphed for victories obtained over the Parthians; he was of obscure 
<A NAME="853"></A>birth, but, by means of Antony's friendship, obtained an opportunity of 
<A NAME="854"></A>showing his capacity, and doing great things; and his making such glorious 
<A NAME="855"></A>use of it gave new credit to the current observation about Caesar and Antony, 
<A NAME="856"></A>that they were more fortunate in what they did by their lieutenants than 
<A NAME="857"></A>in their own persons. For Sossius, also, had great success, and Canidius, 
<A NAME="858"></A>whom he left in Armenia, defeated the people there, and also the kings 
<A NAME="859"></A>of the Albanians and Iberians, and marched victorious as far as Caucasus, 
<A NAME="860"></A>by which means the fame of Antony's arms had become great among the barbarous 
<A NAME="861"></A>nations.
<A NAME="862"></A><BR><BR>He, however, once more, upon some unfavourable stories, taking 
<A NAME="863"></A>offence against Caesar, set sail with three hundred ships for Italy, and, 
<A NAME="864"></A>being refused admittance to the port of Brundusium, made for Tarentum. 
<A NAME="865"></A>There his wife Octavia, who came from Greece with him, obtained leave to 
<A NAME="866"></A>visit her brother, she being then great with child, having already borne 
<A NAME="867"></A>her husband a second daughter; and as she was on her way she met Caesar, 
<A NAME="868"></A>with his two friends Agrippa and Maecenas, and, taking these two aside, 
<A NAME="869"></A>with great entreaties and lamentations she told them, that of the most 
<A NAME="870"></A>fortunate woman upon earth, she was in danger of becoming the most unhappy; 
<A NAME="871"></A>for as yet every one's eyes were fixed upon her as the wife and sister 
<A NAME="872"></A>of the two great commanders, but, if rash counsels should prevail, and 
<A NAME="873"></A>war ensue, "I shall be miserable," said she, "without redress; for on what 
<A NAME="874"></A>side soever victory falls, I shall be sure to be a loser." Caesar was overcome 
<A NAME="875"></A>by these entreaties, and advanced in a peaceable temper to Tarentum, where 
<A NAME="876"></A>those that were present beheld a most stately spectacle; a vast army the 
<A NAME="877"></A>up by the shore, and as great a fleet in the harbour, all without the occurrence 
<A NAME="878"></A>of friends, and other expressions of joy and kindness, passing from one 
<A NAME="879"></A>armament to the other. Antony first entertained Caesar, this also being 
<A NAME="880"></A>a concession on Caesar's part to his sister; and when at length an agreement 
<A NAME="881"></A>was made between them, that Caesar should give Antony two of his legions 
<A NAME="882"></A>to serve him in the Parthian war, and that Antony should in return leave 
<A NAME="883"></A>with him a hundred armed galleys, Octavia further obtained of her husband, 
<A NAME="884"></A>besides this, twenty light ships for her brother, and of her brother, a 
<A NAME="885"></A>thousand foot for her husband. So, having parted good friends, Caesar went 
<A NAME="886"></A>immediately to make war with Pompey to conquer Sicily. And Antony, leaving 
<A NAME="887"></A>in Caesar's charge his wife and children, and his children by his former 
<A NAME="888"></A>wife Fulvia, set sail for Asia.
<A NAME="889"></A><BR><BR>But the mischief that thus long had lain still, the passion for 
<A NAME="890"></A>Cleopatra, which better thoughts had seemed to have lulled and charmed 
<A NAME="891"></A>into oblivion, upon his approach to Syria gathered strength again, and 
<A NAME="892"></A>broke out into a flame. And, in fine, like Plato's restive and rebellious 
<A NAME="893"></A>horse of the human soul, flinging off all good and wholesome counsel, and 
<A NAME="894"></A>breaking fairly loose, he sends Fonteius Capito to bring Cleopatra into 
<A NAME="895"></A>Syria. To whom at her arrival he made no small or trifling present, Phoenicia, 
<A NAME="896"></A>Coele-Syria, Cyprus, great part of Cilicia, that side of Judaea which produces 
<A NAME="897"></A>balm, that part of Arabia where the Nabathaeans extend to the outer sea; 
<A NAME="898"></A>profuse gifts which much displeased the Romans. For although he had invested 
<A NAME="899"></A>several private persons in great governments and kingdoms, and bereaved 
<A NAME="900"></A>many kings of theirs, as Antigonus of Judaea, whose head he caused to be 
<A NAME="901"></A>struck off (the first example of that punishment being inflicted on a king), 
<A NAME="902"></A>yet nothing stung the Romans like the shame of these honours paid to Cleopatra. 
<A NAME="903"></A>Their dissatisfaction was augmented also by his acknowledging as his own 
<A NAME="904"></A>the twin children he had by her, giving them the name of Alexander and 
<A NAME="905"></A>Cleopatra, and adding, as their surnames, the titles of Sun and Moon. But 
<A NAME="906"></A>he, who knew how to put a good colour on the most dishonest action, would 
<A NAME="907"></A>say that the greatness of the Roman empire consisted more in giving than 
<A NAME="908"></A>in taking kingdoms, and that the way to carry noble blood through the world 
<A NAME="909"></A>was by begetting in every place a new line and series of kings; his own 
<A NAME="910"></A>ancestor had thus been born of Hercules; Hercules had not limited his hopes 
<A NAME="911"></A>of progeny to a single womb, nor feared any law like Solon's or any audit 
<A NAME="912"></A>of procreation, but had freely let nature take her will in the foundation 
<A NAME="913"></A>and first commencement of many families.
<A NAME="914"></A><BR><BR>After Phraates had killed his father Hyrodes, and taken possession 
<A NAME="915"></A>of his kingdom, many of the Parthians left their country; among the rest 
<A NAME="916"></A>Monaeses, a man of great distinction and authority, sought refuge with 
<A NAME="917"></A>Antony, who, looking on his case as similar to that of Themistocles, and 
<A NAME="918"></A>likening his own opulence and magnanimity to those of the former Persian 
<A NAME="919"></A>kings, gave him three cities, Larissa, Arethusa, and Hierapolis, which 
<A NAME="920"></A>was formerly called Bambyce. But when the King of Parthia soon recalled 
<A NAME="921"></A>him, giving him his word and honour for his safety, Antony was not unwilling 
<A NAME="922"></A>to give him leave to return, hoping thereby to surprise Phraates, who would 
<A NAME="923"></A>believe that peace would continue; for he only made the demand of him that 
<A NAME="924"></A>he should send back the Roman ensigns which were taken when Crassus was 
<A NAME="925"></A>slain, and the prisoners that remained yet alive. This done, he sent Cleopatra 
<A NAME="926"></A>to Egypt, and marched through Arabia and Armenia; and, when his forces 
<A NAME="927"></A>came together, and were joined by those of his confederate kings (of whom 
<A NAME="928"></A>there were very many, and the most considerable, Artavasdes, King of Armenia, 
<A NAME="929"></A>who came at the head of six thousand horse and seven thousand foot), he 
<A NAME="930"></A>made a general muster. There appeared sixty thousand Roman foot, ten thousand 
<A NAME="931"></A>horse, Spaniards and Gauls, who counted as Romans; and, of other nations, 
<A NAME="932"></A>horse and foot thirty thousand. And these great preparations, that put 
<A NAME="933"></A>the Indians beyond Bactria into alarm, and made all Asia shake, were all 
<A NAME="934"></A>we are told rendered useless to him because of Cleopatra. For, in order 
<A NAME="935"></A>to pass the winter with her, the war was pushed on before its due time; 
<A NAME="936"></A>and all he did was done without perfect consideration, as by a man who 
<A NAME="937"></A>had no power of control over his faculties, who, under the effect of some 
<A NAME="938"></A>drug or magic, was still looking back elsewhere, and whose object was much 
<A NAME="939"></A>more to hasten his return than to conquer his enemies.
<A NAME="940"></A><BR><BR>For, first of all, when he should have taken up his winter-quarters 
<A NAME="941"></A>in Armenia, to refresh his men, who were tired with long marches, having 
<A NAME="942"></A>come at least eight thousand furlongs, and then having taken the advantage 
<A NAME="943"></A>in the beginning of the spring to invade Media, before the Parthians were 
<A NAME="944"></A>out of winter-quarters, he had not patience to expect his time, but marched 
<A NAME="945"></A>into the province of Atropatene, leaving Armenia on the left hand, and 
<A NAME="946"></A>laid waste all that country. Secondly, his haste was so great that he left 
<A NAME="947"></A>behind the engines absolutely required for any siege, which followed the 
<A NAME="948"></A>camp in three hundred wagons, and, among the rest, a ram eighty feet long; 
<A NAME="949"></A>none of which was it possible, if lost or damaged, to repair or to make 
<A NAME="950"></A>the like, as the provinces of the Upper Asia produce no trees long or hard 
<A NAME="951"></A>enough for such uses. Nevertheless, he left them all behind, as a mere 
<A NAME="952"></A>impediment to his speed, in the charge of a detachment under the command 
<A NAME="953"></A>of Statianus, the wagon officer. He himself laid siege to Phraata, a principal 
<A NAME="954"></A>city of the King of Media, wherein were that king's wife and children. 
<A NAME="955"></A>And when actual need proved the greatness of his error, in leaving the 
<A NAME="956"></A>siege-train behind him, he had nothing for it but to come up and raise 
<A NAME="957"></A>a mound against the walls, with infinite labour and great loss of time. 
<A NAME="958"></A>Meantime Phraates, coming down with a large army, and hearing that the 
<A NAME="959"></A>wagons were left behind with the battering engines, sent a strong party 
<A NAME="960"></A>of horse, by which Statianus was surprised, he himself and ten thousand 
<A NAME="961"></A>of his men slain, the engines all broken in pieces, many taken prisoners, 
<A NAME="962"></A>and among the rest King Polemon.
<A NAME="963"></A><BR><BR>This great miscarriage in the opening of the campaign much discouraged 
<A NAME="964"></A>Antony's army, and Artavasdes, King of Armenia, deciding that the Roman 
<A NAME="965"></A>prospects were bad, withdrew with all his forces from the camp, although 
<A NAME="966"></A>he had been the chief promoter of the war. The Parthians, encouraged by 
<A NAME="967"></A>their success, came up to the Romans at the siege, and gave them many affronts; 
<A NAME="968"></A>upon which Antony, fearing that the despondency and alarm of his soldiers 
<A NAME="969"></A>would only grow worse if he let them lie idle taking all the horse, ten 
<A NAME="970"></A>legions, and three praetorian cohorts of heavy infantry, resolved to go 
<A NAME="971"></A>out and forage, designing by this means to draw the enemy with more advantage 
<A NAME="972"></A>to a battle. To effect this, he marched a day's journey from his camp, 
<A NAME="973"></A>and finding the Parthians hovering about, in readiness to attack him while 
<A NAME="974"></A>he was in motion, he gave orders for the signal of battle to be hung out 
<A NAME="975"></A>in the encampment, but, at the same time, pulled down the tents, as if 
<A NAME="976"></A>he meant not to fight, but to lead his men home again; and so he proceeded 
<A NAME="977"></A>to lead them past the enemy, who were drawn up in a half-moon, his orders 
<A NAME="978"></A>being that the horse should charge as soon as the legions were come up 
<A NAME="979"></A>near enough to second them. The Parthians, standing still while the Romans 
<A NAME="980"></A>marched by them, were in great admiration of their army, and of the exact 
<A NAME="981"></A>discipline it observed, rank after rank passing on at equal distances in 
<A NAME="982"></A>perfect order and silence, their pikes all ready in their hands. But when 
<A NAME="983"></A>the signal was given, and the horse turned short upon the Parthians, and 
<A NAME="984"></A>with loud cries charged them, they bravely received them, though they were 
<A NAME="985"></A>at once too near for bowshot; but the legions coming up with loud shouts 
<A NAME="986"></A>and rattling of their arms so frightened their horses and indeed the men 
<A NAME="987"></A>themselves, that they kept their ground no longer. Antony pressed them 
<A NAME="988"></A>hard, in great hopes that this victory should put an end to the war; the 
<A NAME="989"></A>foot had them in pursuit for fifty furlongs, and the horse for thrice that 
<A NAME="990"></A>distance, and yet, the advantage summed up, they had but thirty prisoners, 
<A NAME="991"></A>and there were but fourscore slain. So that they were all filled with dejection 
<A NAME="992"></A>and discouragement, to consider that when they were victorious, their advantages 
<A NAME="993"></A>were so small, and that when they were beaten, they lost so great a number 
<A NAME="994"></A>of men as they had done when the carriages were taken.
<A NAME="995"></A><BR><BR>The next day, having put the baggage in order, they marched back 
<A NAME="996"></A>to the camp before Phraata, in the way meeting with some scattering troops 
<A NAME="997"></A>of the enemy, and, as they marched further, with greater parties, at length 
<A NAME="998"></A>with the body of the enemy's army, fresh and in good order, who defied 
<A NAME="999"></A>them to battle, and charged them on every side, and it was not without 
<A NAME="1000"></A>great difficulty that they reached the camp. There Antony, finding that 
<A NAME="1001"></A>his men had in a panic deserted the defence of the mound, upon a sally 
<A NAME="1002"></A>of the Medes, resolved to proceed against them by decimation, as it is 
<A NAME="1003"></A>called, which is done by dividing the soldiers into tens, and, out of every 
<A NAME="1004"></A>ten, putting one to death, as it happens by lot. The rest he gave orders 
<A NAME="1005"></A>should have, instead of wheat, their rations of corn in 
<A NAME="1006"></A>barley.
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR><BR>The war was now become grievous to both parties, and the prospect 
<A NAME="1008"></A>of its continuance yet more fearful to Antony, in respect that he was threatened 
<A NAME="1009"></A>with famine; for he could no longer forage without wounds and slaughter. 
<A NAME="1010"></A>And Phraates, on the other side, was full of apprehension that if the Romans 
<A NAME="1011"></A>were to persist in carrying on the siege, the autumnal equinox being past 
<A NAME="1012"></A>and the air already closing in for cold, he should be deserted by his soldiers, 
<A NAME="1013"></A>who would suffer anything rather than wintering in open field. To prevent 
<A NAME="1014"></A>which, he had recourse to the following deceit: he gave orders to those 
<A NAME="1015"></A>of his men who had made most acquaintance among the Roman soldiers, not 
<A NAME="1016"></A>to pursue too close when they met them foraging, but to suffer them to 
<A NAME="1017"></A>carry off some provision; moreover, that they should praise their valour, 
<A NAME="1018"></A>and declare that it was not without just reason that their king looked 
<A NAME="1019"></A>upon the Romans as the bravest men in the world. This done, upon further 
<A NAME="1020"></A>opportunity, they rode nearer in, and, drawing up their horses by the men, 
<A NAME="1021"></A>began to revile for his obstinacy; that whereas Phraates desired nothing 
<A NAME="1022"></A>more than peace, and an occasion to show how ready he was to save the lives 
<A NAME="1023"></A>of so many brave soldiers, he, on the contrary, gave no opening to any 
<A NAME="1024"></A>friendly offers, but sat awaiting the arrival of the two fiercest and worst 
<A NAME="1025"></A>enemies, winter and famine, from whom it would be hard for them to make 
<A NAME="1026"></A>their escape, even with all the good-will of the Parthians to help them. 
<A NAME="1027"></A>Antony, having these reports from many hands, began to indulge the hope; 
<A NAME="1028"></A>nevertheless, he would not send any message to the Parthian till he had 
<A NAME="1029"></A>put the question to these friendly talkers, whether what they said was 
<A NAME="1030"></A>said by order of their king. Receiving answer that it was, together with 
<A NAME="1031"></A>new encouragement to believe them, he sent some of his friends to demand 
<A NAME="1032"></A>once more the standards and prisoners, lest if he should ask nothing, he 
<A NAME="1033"></A>might be supposed to be too thankful to have leave to retreat in quiet. 
<A NAME="1034"></A>The Parthian king made answer that, as for the standards and prisoners, 
<A NAME="1035"></A>he need not trouble himself: but if he thought fit to retreat, he might 
<A NAME="1036"></A>do it when he pleased, in peace and safety. Some few days, therefore, being 
<A NAME="1037"></A>spent in collecting the baggage he set out upon his march. On which occasion, 
<A NAME="1038"></A>though there was no man of his time like him for addressing a multitude, 
<A NAME="1039"></A>or for carrying soldiers with him by the force of words, out of shame and 
<A NAME="1040"></A>sadness he could not find in his heart to speak himself but employed Domitius 
<A NAME="1041"></A>Aenobarbus. And some of the soldiers resented it, as an undervaluing of 
<A NAME="1042"></A>them; but the greater number saw the true cause, and pitied it, and thought 
<A NAME="1043"></A>it rather a reason why they on their side should treat their general with 
<A NAME="1044"></A>more respect and obedience than ordinary.
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR><BR>Antony had resolved to return by the same way he came, which was 
<A NAME="1046"></A>through a level country clear of all trees; but a certain Mardian came 
<A NAME="1047"></A>to him (one that was very conversant with the manners of the Parthians, 
<A NAME="1048"></A>and whose fidelity to the Romans had been tried at the battle where the 
<A NAME="1049"></A>machines were lost), and advised him to keep the mountains close on his 
<A NAME="1050"></A>right hand, and not to expose his men, heavily armed, in a broad, open, 
<A NAME="1051"></A>riding country, to the attacks of a numerous army of light horse and archers; 
<A NAME="1052"></A>that Phraates with fair promises had persuaded him from the siege on purpose 
<A NAME="1053"></A>that he might with more ease cut him off in his retreat; but if so he pleased, 
<A NAME="1054"></A>he would conduct him by a nearer route, on which moreover he should find 
<A NAME="1055"></A>the necessaries for his army in greater abundance. Antony upon this began 
<A NAME="1056"></A>to consider what was best to be done; he was unwilling to seem to have 
<A NAME="1057"></A>any mistrust of the Parthians after their treaty; but, holding it to be 
<A NAME="1058"></A>really best to march his army the shorter and more inhabited way, he demanded 
<A NAME="1059"></A>of the Mardian some assurance of his faith, who offered himself to be bound 
<A NAME="1060"></A>until the army came safe into Armenia. Two days he conducted the army bound, 
<A NAME="1061"></A>and, on the third, when Antony had given up all thought of the enemy, and 
<A NAME="1062"></A>was marching at his ease in no very good order, the Mardian, perceiving 
<A NAME="1063"></A>the bank of the river broken down, and the water let out and overflowing 
<A NAME="1064"></A>the road by which they were to pass, saw at once that this was the handiwork 
<A NAME="1065"></A>of the Parthians, done out of mischief, and to hinder their march: so he 
<A NAME="1066"></A>advised Antony to be upon his guard, for that the enemy was nigh at hand. 
<A NAME="1067"></A>And sooner had he begun to put his men in order, disposing the slingers 
<A NAME="1068"></A>and dart-men in convenient intervals for sallying out, but the Parthians 
<A NAME="1069"></A>came pouring in on all sides, fully expecting to encompass them, and throw 
<A NAME="1070"></A>the whole army into disorder. They were at once attacked by the light troops, 
<A NAME="1071"></A>whom they galled a good deal with their arrows; but being themselves as 
<A NAME="1072"></A>warmly entertained with the slings and darts, and many wounded, they made 
<A NAME="1073"></A>their retreat. Soon after, rallying up afresh, they were beat back by a 
<A NAME="1074"></A>battalion of Gallic horse, and appeared no more that 
<A NAME="1075"></A>day.
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR><BR>By their manner of attack Antony, seeing what to do, not only placed 
<A NAME="1077"></A>the slings and darts as a rear guard, but also lined both flanks with them, 
<A NAME="1078"></A>and so marched in a square battle, giving order to the horse to charge 
<A NAME="1079"></A>and beat off the
