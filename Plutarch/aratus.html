<A NAME="2"></A>
<BR>(died 213 B.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>
<A NAME="10"></A>The philosopher Chrysippus, O Polycrates, quotes an ancient proverb, not 
<A NAME="11"></A>as really it should be, apprehending, I suppose, that it sounded too harshly, 
<A NAME="12"></A>but so as he thought it would run best, in these words:-
<A NAME="13"></A>"Who praise their fathers but the generous sons?" But Dionysodorus the 
<A NAME="14"></A>Troezenian proves him to be wrong, and restores the true reading, which 
<A NAME="15"></A>is thus:-
<A NAME="16"></A><BR><BR>"Who praise their fathers but degenerate sons?" telling us that 
<A NAME="17"></A>the proverb is meant to stop the mouth of those who, having no merit of 
<A NAME="18"></A>their own, take refuge in the virtues of their ancestors, and make their 
<A NAME="19"></A>advantage of praising them. But, as Pindar hath it-
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><BR>"He that by nature doth inherit
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>From ancestors a noble spirit," as you do, who made your life the copy 
<A NAME="22"></A>of the fairest originals of your family- such, I say, may take great satisfaction 
<A NAME="23"></A>in being reminded, both by hearing others speak and speaking themselves, 
<A NAME="24"></A>of the best of their progenitors. For they assume not the glory of praises 
<A NAME="25"></A>earned by others out of any want of worth of their own, but affiliating 
<A NAME="26"></A>their own deeds to those of their ancestors, give them honour as the authors 
<A NAME="27"></A>both of their descent and manners. Therefore I have sent to you the life 
<A NAME="28"></A>which I have written of your fellow-citizen and forefather, Aratus, to 
<A NAME="29"></A>whom you are no discredit in point either of reputation or of authority, 
<A NAME="30"></A>not as though you had not been most diligently concerning to inform yourself 
<A NAME="31"></A>from the beginning concerning his actions, but that your sons, Polycrates 
<A NAME="32"></A>and Pythocles, may both by hearing and reading become familiar with those 
<A NAME="33"></A>family examples which it behooves them to follow and imitate. It is a piece 
<A NAME="34"></A>of self-love, and not of the love of virtue, to imagine one has already 
<A NAME="35"></A>attained to what is best.
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR>The city of Sicyon, from the time that it first fell off from the 
<A NAME="37"></A>pure and Doric aristocracy (its harmony being destroyed, and a mere series 
<A NAME="38"></A>of seditions and personal contests of popular leaders ensuing), continued 
<A NAME="39"></A>to be distempered and unsettled, changing from one tyrant to another, until, 
<A NAME="40"></A>Cleon being slain, Timoclides and Clinias, men of the most repute and power 
<A NAME="41"></A>amongst the citizens, were chosen to the magistracy. And the commonwealth 
<A NAME="42"></A>now seeming to be in a pretty settled condition, Timoclides died, and Abantidas, 
<A NAME="43"></A>the son of Paseas, to possess himself of the tyranny, killed Clinias, and, 
<A NAME="44"></A>of his kindred and friends, slew some and banished others. He sought also 
<A NAME="45"></A>to kill his son Aratus, whom he left behind him, being but seven years 
<A NAME="46"></A>old. This boy in the general disorder getting out of the house with those 
<A NAME="47"></A>that fled, and wandering about the city helpless and in great fear, by 
<A NAME="48"></A>chance got undiscovered into the house of a woman who was Abantidas's sister, 
<A NAME="49"></A>but married to Prophantus, the brother of Clinias, her name being Soso. 
<A NAME="50"></A>She, being of a generous temper, and believing the boy had by some supernatural 
<A NAME="51"></A>guidance fled to her for shelter, hid him in the house, and at night sent 
<A NAME="52"></A>him away to Argos.
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR>Aratus, being thus delivered and secured from this danger, conceived 
<A NAME="54"></A>from the first and ever after nourished a vehement and burning hatred against 
<A NAME="55"></A>tyrants, which strengthened with his years. Being therefore bred up amongst 
<A NAME="56"></A>his father's acquaintance and friends at Argos with a liberal education, 
<A NAME="57"></A>and perceiving his body to promise good health and stature, he addicted 
<A NAME="58"></A>himself to the exercises of the palaestra, to that degree that he competed 
<A NAME="59"></A>in the five games, and gained some crowns; and indeed in his statues one 
<A NAME="60"></A>may observe a certain kind of athletic cast, and the sagacity and majesty 
<A NAME="61"></A>of his countenance does not dissemble his full diet and the use of the 
<A NAME="62"></A>hoe. Whence it came to pass that he less studied eloquence than perhaps 
<A NAME="63"></A>became a statesman, and yet he was more accomplished in speaking than many 
<A NAME="64"></A>believe, judging by the commentaries which he left behind him, written 
<A NAME="65"></A>carelessly and, by the way, as fast as he could do it, and in such words 
<A NAME="66"></A>as first came to his mind.
<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR>In the course of time, Dinias and Aristoteles the logician killed 
<A NAME="68"></A>Abantidas, who used to be present in the market-place at their discussions, 
<A NAME="69"></A>and to make one in them; till they taking the occasion, insensibly accustomed 
<A NAME="70"></A>him to the practice, and so had opportunity to contrive and execute a plot 
<A NAME="71"></A>against him. After him Paseas, the father of Abantidas, taking upon him 
<A NAME="72"></A>the government, was assassinated by Nicocles, who himself set up for tyrant. 
<A NAME="73"></A>Of him it is related that he was strikingly like Periander, the son of 
<A NAME="74"></A>Cypselus, just as it is said that Orontes the Persian bore a great resemblance 
<A NAME="75"></A>to Alcmaeon, the son of Amphiaraus, and that Lacedaemonian youth, whom 
<A NAME="76"></A>Myrsilus relates to have been trodden to pieces by the crowd of those that 
<A NAME="77"></A>came to see him upon that report, to Hector.
<A NAME="78"></A><BR><BR>This Nicocles governed four months, in which, after he had done 
<A NAME="79"></A>all kinds of mischief to the city, he very nearly let it fall into the 
<A NAME="80"></A>hands of the Aetolians. By this time Aratus, being grown a youth, was in 
<A NAME="81"></A>much esteem, both for his noble birth, and his spirit and disposition, 
<A NAME="82"></A>which, while neither insignificant nor wanting in energy, were solid, and 
<A NAME="83"></A>tempered with a steadiness of judgment beyond his years. For which reason 
<A NAME="84"></A>the exiles had their eyes most upon him, nor did Nicocles less observe 
<A NAME="85"></A>his motions, but secretly spied and watched him, not out of apprehension 
<A NAME="86"></A>of any such considerable or utterly audacious attempt, but suspecting he 
<A NAME="87"></A>held correspondence with the kings, who were his father's friends and acquaintance. 
<A NAME="88"></A>And, indeed, Aratus first attempted this way; but finding that Antigonus, 
<A NAME="89"></A>who had promised fair, neglected him and delayed the time, and that his 
<A NAME="90"></A>hopes from Egypt and Ptolemy were long to wait for, he determined to cut 
<A NAME="91"></A>off the tyrant by himself.
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR>And first he broke his mind to Aristomachus and Ecdelus, the one 
<A NAME="93"></A>an exile of Sicyon, the other, Ecdelus, an Arcadian of Megalopolis, a philosopher, 
<A NAME="94"></A>and a man of action, having been the familiar friend of Arcesilaus the 
<A NAME="95"></A>Academic at Athens. These readily consenting, he communicated with the 
<A NAME="96"></A>other exiles, whereof some few, being ashamed to seem to despair of success, 
<A NAME="97"></A>engaged in the design; but most of them endeavoured to divert him from 
<A NAME="98"></A>his purpose, as one that for want of experience was too rash and 
<A NAME="99"></A>daring.
<A NAME="100"></A><BR><BR>Whilst he was consulting to seize upon some post in Sicyonia, from 
<A NAME="101"></A>whence he might make war upon the tyrant, there came to Argos a certain 
<A NAME="102"></A>Sicyonian, newly escaped out of prison, brother to Xenocles, one of the 
<A NAME="103"></A>exiles, who, being by him presented to Aratus, informed him that that part 
<A NAME="104"></A>of the wall over which he escaped was, inside, almost level with the ground, 
<A NAME="105"></A>adjoining a rocky and elevated place, and that from the outside it might 
<A NAME="106"></A>be scaled with ladders. Aratus, hearing this, despatches away Xenocles 
<A NAME="107"></A>with two of his own servants, Seuthas and Technon, to view the wall, resolving, 
<A NAME="108"></A>if possible, secretly and with one risk to hazard all on a single trial, 
<A NAME="109"></A>rather than carry on a contest as a private man against a tyrant by long 
<A NAME="110"></A>war and open force. Xenocles, therefore, with his companions, returning, 
<A NAME="111"></A>having taken the height of the wall, and declaring the place not to be 
<A NAME="112"></A>impossible or indeed difficult to get over, but that it was not easy to 
<A NAME="113"></A>approach it undiscovered by reason of some small but uncommonly savage 
<A NAME="114"></A>and noisy dogs belonging to a gardener hard by, he immediately undertook 
<A NAME="115"></A>the business.
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR>Now the preparation of arms gave no jealousy, because robberies 
<A NAME="117"></A>and petty forays were at that time common everywhere between one set of 
<A NAME="118"></A>people and another; and for the ladders, Euphranor, the machine-maker, 
<A NAME="119"></A>made them openly, his trade rendering him unsuspected, though one of the 
<A NAME="120"></A>exiles. As for men, each of his friends in Argos furnished him with ten 
<A NAME="121"></A>apiece out of those few they had, and he armed thirty of his own servants, 
<A NAME="122"></A>and hired some few soldiers of Xenophilus, the chief of the robber captains, 
<A NAME="123"></A>to whom it was given out that they were to march into the territory of 
<A NAME="124"></A>Sicyon to seize the king's stud; most of them were sent before, in small 
<A NAME="125"></A>parties, to the tower of Polygnotus, with orders to wait there; Caphisias 
<A NAME="126"></A>also was despatched beforehand lightly armed, with four others, who were, 
<A NAME="127"></A>as soon as it was dark, to come to the gardener's house, pretending to 
<A NAME="128"></A>be travellers, and procuring their lodging there, to shut up him and his 
<A NAME="129"></A>dogs; for there was no other way to getting past. And for the ladders, 
<A NAME="130"></A>they had been made to take in pieces, and were put into chests, and sent 
<A NAME="131"></A>before, hidden upon wagons. In the meantime, some of the spies of Nicocles 
<A NAME="132"></A>appearing in Argos, and being said to go privately about watching Aratus, 
<A NAME="133"></A>he came early in the morning into the market-place, showing himself openly 
<A NAME="134"></A>and conversing with his friends; then he anointed himself in the exercise 
<A NAME="135"></A>ground, and, taking with him thence some of the young men that used to 
<A NAME="136"></A>drink and spend their time with him, he went home; and presently after 
<A NAME="137"></A>several of his servants were seen about the market-place, one carrying 
<A NAME="138"></A>garlands, another buying flambeaux, and a third speaking to the women that 
<A NAME="139"></A>used to sing and play at banquets, all of which things the spies observing 
<A NAME="140"></A>were deceived, and said, laughing to one another. "Certainly nothing can 
<A NAME="141"></A>be more timorous than a tyrant, if Nicocles, being master of so great a 
<A NAME="142"></A>city and so numerous a force, stands in fear of a youth that spends what 
<A NAME="143"></A>he has to subsist upon in his banishment in pleasures and day-debauches;" 
<A NAME="144"></A>and, being thus imposed upon, they returned home.
<A NAME="145"></A><BR><BR>But Aratus, departing immediately after his morning meal, and coming 
<A NAME="146"></A>to his soldiers at Polygnotus's tower, led them to Nemea; where he disclosed 
<A NAME="147"></A>to most of them, for the first time, his true design, making them large 
<A NAME="148"></A>promises and fair speeches, and marched towards the city, giving for the 
<A NAME="149"></A>word Apollo victorious, proportioning his march to the motion of the moon, 
<A NAME="150"></A>so as to have the benefit of her light upon the way, and to be in the garden, 
<A NAME="151"></A>which was close to the wall, just as she was setting. Here Caphisias to 
<A NAME="152"></A>him, who had not secured the dogs, which had run away before he could catch 
<A NAME="153"></A>them, but had only made sure of the gardener. Upon which most of the company 
<A NAME="154"></A>being out of heart and desiring to retreat, Aratus encouraged them to go 
<A NAME="155"></A>on, promising to retire in case the dogs were too troublesome; at the same 
<A NAME="156"></A>time sending forward those that carried the ladders, conducted by Ecdelus 
<A NAME="157"></A>and Mnasitheus, he followed them himself leisurely, the dogs already barking 
<A NAME="158"></A>very loud and following the steps of Ecdelus and his companion. However, 
<A NAME="159"></A>they got to the wall, and reared the ladders with safety. But as the foremost 
<A NAME="160"></A>men were mounting them, the captain of the watch that was to be relieved 
<A NAME="161"></A>by the morning guard passed on his way with the bell; and there were many 
<A NAME="162"></A>lights, and a noise of people coming up. Hearing which, they clapt themselves 
<A NAME="163"></A>close to the ladders, and so were unobserved; but as the other watch also 
<A NAME="164"></A>was coming up to meet this, they were in extreme danger of being discovered. 
<A NAME="165"></A>But when this also went by without observing them, immediately Mnasitheus 
<A NAME="166"></A>and Ecdelus got upon the wall, and, possessing themselves of the approaches 
<A NAME="167"></A>inside and out, sent away Technon to Aratus, desiring him to make all the 
<A NAME="168"></A>haste he could.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>Now there was no great distance from the garden to the wall and 
<A NAME="170"></A>to the tower in which latter a large hound was kept. The hound did not 
<A NAME="171"></A>hear their steps of himself, whether that he were naturally drowsy, or 
<A NAME="172"></A>over-wearied the day before, but, the gardener's curs awaking him, he first 
<A NAME="173"></A>began to growl and grumble in response, and then as they passed by to bark 
<A NAME="174"></A>out aloud. And the barking was now so great, that the sentinel opposite 
<A NAME="175"></A>shouted out to the dog's keeper to know why the dog kept such a barking, 
<A NAME="176"></A>and whether anything was the matter; who answered, that it was nothing 
<A NAME="177"></A>but only that his dog had been set barking by the lights of the watch and 
<A NAME="178"></A>the noise of the bell. This reply much encouraged Aratus's soldiers, who 
<A NAME="179"></A>thought the dog's keeper was privy to their design, and wished to conceal 
<A NAME="180"></A>what was passing, and that many others in the city were of the conspiracy. 
<A NAME="181"></A>But when they came to scale the wall, the attempt then appeared both to 
<A NAME="182"></A>require time and to be full of danger, for the ladders shook and tottered 
<A NAME="183"></A>extremely unless they mounted them leisurely and one by one, and time pressed, 
<A NAME="184"></A>for the cocks began to crow, and the country people that used to bring 
<A NAME="185"></A>things to the market would be coming to the town directly. Therefore Aratus 
<A NAME="186"></A>made haste to get up himself, forty only of the company being already upon 
<A NAME="187"></A>the wall and, staying but for a few more of those that were below, he made 
<A NAME="188"></A>straight to the tyrant's house and the general's office, where the mercenary 
<A NAME="189"></A>soldiers passed the night, and, coming suddenly upon them, and taking them 
<A NAME="190"></A>prisoners without killing any one of them, he immediately sent to all his 
<A NAME="191"></A>friends in their houses to desire them to come to him, which they did from 
<A NAME="192"></A>all quarters. By this time the day began to break, and the theatre was 
<A NAME="193"></A>filled with a multitude that were held in suspense by uncertain reports 
<A NAME="194"></A>and knew nothing distinctly of what had happened, until a public crier 
<A NAME="195"></A>came forward and proclaimed that Aratus, the son of Clinias, invited the 
<A NAME="196"></A>citizens to recover their liberty.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>Then at last assured that what they had so long looked for was 
<A NAME="198"></A>come to pass, they pressed in throngs to the tyrant's gates to set them 
<A NAME="199"></A>on fire. And such a flame was kindled, the whole house catching fire, that 
<A NAME="200"></A>it was seen as far as Corinth; so that the Corinthians, wondering what 
<A NAME="201"></A>the matter could be, were upon the point of coming to their assistance. 
<A NAME="202"></A>Nicocles fled away secretly out of the city by means of certain underground 
<A NAME="203"></A>passages, and the soldiers helping the Sicyonians to quench the fire, plundered 
<A NAME="204"></A>the house. This Aratus hindered not, but divided also the rest of the riches 
<A NAME="205"></A>of the tyrant amongst the citizens. In this exploit, not one of these engaged 
<A NAME="206"></A>in it was slain, nor any of the contrary party, fortune so ordering the 
<A NAME="207"></A>action as to be clear and free from civil bloodshed. He restored eighty 
<A NAME="208"></A>exiles who had been expelled by Nicocles, and no less than five hundred 
<A NAME="209"></A>who had been driven out by former tyrants and had endured a long banishment, 
<A NAME="210"></A>pretty nearly, by this time, of fifty years' duration. These returning, 
<A NAME="211"></A>most of them very poor, were impatient to enter upon their former possessions, 
<A NAME="212"></A>and, proceeding to their several farms and houses, gave great perplexity 
<A NAME="213"></A>to Aratus, who considered that the city without was envied for its liberty 
<A NAME="214"></A>and aimed at by Antigonus, and within was full of disorder and sedition. 
<A NAME="215"></A>Wherefore, as things stood, he thought it best to associate it to the Achaean 
<A NAME="216"></A>community, and so, although Dorians, they of their own will took upon them 
<A NAME="217"></A>the name and citizenship of the Achaeans, who at that time had neither 
<A NAME="218"></A>great repute nor much power. For the most of them lived in small towns, 
<A NAME="219"></A>and their territory was neither large nor fruitful, and the neighbouring 
<A NAME="220"></A>sea was almost wholly without a harbour, breaking direct upon a rocky shore. 
<A NAME="221"></A>But yet these above others made it appear that the Grecian courage was 
<A NAME="222"></A>invincible, whensoever it could only have order and concord within itself 
<A NAME="223"></A>and a prudent general to direct it. For though they had scarcely been counted 
<A NAME="224"></A>as any part of the ancient Grecian power, and at this time it did not equal 
<A NAME="225"></A>the strength of one ordinary city, yet by prudence and unanimity, and because 
<A NAME="226"></A>they knew not how to envy and malign, but to obey and follow him amongst 
<A NAME="227"></A>them that was most eminent for virtue, they not only preserved their own 
<A NAME="228"></A>liberty in the midst of so many great cities, military powers, and monarchies, 
<A NAME="229"></A>but went on steadily saving and delivering from slavery great numbers of 
<A NAME="230"></A>the Greeks.
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR>As for Aratus, he was in his behaviour a true statesman, high-minded, 
<A NAME="232"></A>and more intent upon the public than his private concerns, a bitter hater 
<A NAME="233"></A>of tyrants, making the common good the rule and law of his friendships 
<A NAME="234"></A>and enmities. So that indeed he seems not to have been so faithful a friend, 
<A NAME="235"></A>as he was a reasonable and gentle enemy, ready, according to the needs 
<A NAME="236"></A>of the state, to suit himself on occasion to either side; concord between 
<A NAME="237"></A>nations, brotherhood between cities, the council and the assembly unanimous 
<A NAME="238"></A>in their votes, being the objects above all other blessings to which he 
<A NAME="239"></A>was passionately devoted; backward, indeed, and diffident in the use of 
<A NAME="240"></A>arms and often force, but in effecting a purpose underhand, and outwitting 
<A NAME="241"></A>cities and potentates without observation, most politic and dexterous. 
<A NAME="242"></A>Therefore, though he succeeded beyond hope in many enterprises which he 
<A NAME="243"></A>undertook, yet he seems to have left quite as many unattempted, though 
<A NAME="244"></A>feasible enough, for want of assurance. For it should seem, that as the 
<A NAME="245"></A>sight of certain beasts is strong in the night but dim by day, the tenderness 
<A NAME="246"></A>of the humours of their eyes not bearing the contact of the light, so there 
<A NAME="247"></A>is also one kind of human skill and sagacity which is easily daunted and 
<A NAME="248"></A>disturbed in actions done in the open day and before the world, and recovers 
<A NAME="249"></A>all its self-possession in secret and covert enterprises; which inequality 
<A NAME="250"></A>is occasioned in noble minds for want of philosophy, a mere wild and uncultivated 
<A NAME="251"></A>fruit of a virtue without true knowledge coming up; as might be made out 
<A NAME="252"></A>by examples.
<A NAME="253"></A><BR><BR>Aratus, therefore, having associated himself and his city to the 
<A NAME="254"></A>Achaeans, served in the cavalry, and made himself much beloved by his commanding 
<A NAME="255"></A>officers for his exact obedience; for though he had made so large an addition 
<A NAME="256"></A>to the common strength as that of his own credit and the power of his country, 
<A NAME="257"></A>yet he was as ready as the most ordinary person to be commanded by the 
<A NAME="258"></A>Achaean general of the time being, whether he were a man of Dynae, or of 
<A NAME="259"></A>Tritaea, or any yet meaner town than these. Having also a present of five-and-twenty 
<A NAME="260"></A>talents sent him from the king, he took them but gave them all to his fellow-citizens 
<A NAME="261"></A>who wanted money, amongst other purposes, for the redemption of those who 
<A NAME="262"></A>had been taken prisoners.
<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR>But the exiles being by no means to be satisfied, disturbing continually 
<A NAME="264"></A>those that were in possession of their estates, Sicyon was in great danger 
<A NAME="265"></A>of falling into perfect desolation; so that, having no hope left but in 
<A NAME="266"></A>the kindness of Ptolemy, he resolved to sail to him, and to beg so much 
<A NAME="267"></A>money of him as might reconcile all parties. So he set sail from Mothone 
<A NAME="268"></A>beyond Malea, designing to make the direct passage. But the pilot not being 
<A NAME="269"></A>able to keep the vessel up against a strong wind and high waves that came 
<A NAME="270"></A>in from the open sea, he was driven from his course, and with much ado 
<A NAME="271"></A>got to shore in Andros, an enemy's land, possessed by Antigonus, who had 
<A NAME="272"></A>a garrison there. To avoid which he immediately landed, and, leaving the 
<A NAME="273"></A>ship, went up into the country a good way from the sea, having along with 
<A NAME="274"></A>him only one friend, called Timanthes; and throwing themselves into some 
<A NAME="275"></A>ground thickly covered with wood, they had but an ill night's rest of it. 
<A NAME="276"></A>Not long after, the commander of the troops came, and, inquiring for Aratus, 
<A NAME="277"></A>was deceived by his servants, who had been instructed to say that he had 
<A NAME="278"></A>fled at once over into the island of Euboea. However, he declared the ship, 
<A NAME="279"></A>the property on board of her, and the servants, to be lawful prize, and 
<A NAME="280"></A>detained them accordingly. As for Aratus, after some few days in his extremity, 
<A NAME="281"></A>by good fortune a Roman ship happened to put in just at the spot in which 
<A NAME="282"></A>he made his abode, sometimes peeping out to seek his opportunity, sometimes 
<A NAME="283"></A>keeping close. She was bound for Syria; but going aboard, he agreed with 
<A NAME="284"></A>the master to land him in Caria. In which voyage he met with no less danger 
<A NAME="285"></A>on the sea than before. From Caria being after much time arrived in Egypt, 
<A NAME="286"></A>he immediately went to the king, who had a great kindness for him, and 
<A NAME="287"></A>had received from him many presents of drawings and paintings out of Greece. 
<A NAME="288"></A>Aratus had a very good judgment in them, and always took care to collect 
<A NAME="289"></A>and send him the most curious and finished works, especially those of Pamphilus 
<A NAME="290"></A>and Melanthus.
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR>For the Sicyonian pieces were still in the height of their reputation, 
<A NAME="292"></A>as being the only ones whose colours were lasting; so that Apelles himself, 
<A NAME="293"></A>even after he had become well known and admired, went thither, and gave 
<A NAME="294"></A>a talent to be admitted into the society of the painters there, not so 
<A NAME="295"></A>much to partake of their skill, which he wanted not, but of their credit. 
<A NAME="296"></A>And accordingly Aratus, when he freed the city, immediately took down the 
<A NAME="297"></A>representations of the rest of the tyrants, but demurred a long time about 
<A NAME="298"></A>that of Aristratus, who flourished in the time of Philip. For this Aristratus 
<A NAME="299"></A>was painted by Melanthus and his scholars, standing by a chariot, in which 
<A NAME="300"></A>a figure of Victory was carried, Apelles himself having had a hand in it, 
<A NAME="301"></A>as Polemon the geographer reports. It was an extraordinary piece, and therefore 
<A NAME="302"></A>Aratus was fain to spare it for the workmanship, and yet, instigated by 
<A NAME="303"></A>the hatred he bore the tyrants, commanded it to be taken down. But Neacles 
<A NAME="304"></A>the painter, one of Aratus's friends, entreated him, it is said, with tears 
<A NAME="305"></A>in his eyes, to spare it, and, finding he did not prevail with him, told 
<A NAME="306"></A>him at last he should carry on his war with the tyrants, but with the tyrants 
<A NAME="307"></A>alone: "Let therefore the chariot and the Victory stand, and I will take 
<A NAME="308"></A>means for the removal of Aristratus;" to which Aratus consenting, Neacles 
<A NAME="309"></A>blotted out Aristratus, and in his place painted a palm-tree, not daring 
<A NAME="310"></A>to add anything else of his own invention. The feet of the defaced figure 
<A NAME="311"></A>of Aristratus are said to have escaped notice, and to be hid under the 
<A NAME="312"></A>chariot. By these means Aratus got favour with the king, who, after he 
<A NAME="313"></A>was more fully acquainted with him, loved him so much the more, and gave 
<A NAME="314"></A>him for the relief of his city one hundred and fifty talents; forty of 
<A NAME="315"></A>which he immediately carried away with him, when he sailed to Peloponnesus, 
<A NAME="316"></A>but the rest the king divided into instalments, and sent them to him afterwards 
<A NAME="317"></A>at different times.
<A NAME="318"></A><BR><BR>Assuredly it was a great thing to procure for his fellow-citizens 
<A NAME="319"></A>a sum of money, a small portion of which had been sufficient, when presented 
<A NAME="320"></A>by a king to other captains and popular leaders, to induce them to turn 
<A NAME="321"></A>dishonest, and betray and give away their native countries to him. But 
<A NAME="322"></A>it was a much greater, that by means of this money he effected a reconciliation 
<A NAME="323"></A>and good understanding between the rich and poor, and created quiet and 
<A NAME="324"></A>security for the whole people. His moderation, also, amidst so great power 
<A NAME="325"></A>was very admirable. For being declared sole arbitrator and plenipotentiary 
<A NAME="326"></A>for settling the questions of property in the case of the exiles, he would 
<A NAME="327"></A>not accept the commission alone, but, associating with himself fifteen 
<A NAME="328"></A>of the citizens, with great pains and trouble he succeeded in adjusting 
<A NAME="329"></A>matters, and established peace and good-will in the city, for which good 
<A NAME="330"></A>service, not only all the citizens in general bestowed extraordinary honours 
<A NAME="331"></A>upon him, but the exiles, apart by themselves, erecting his statue in brass, 
<A NAME="332"></A>inscribed on it these elegiac verses:-
<A NAME="333"></A><BR><BR>"Your counsels, deeds, and skill for Greece in 
<A NAME="334"></A>war
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>Known beyond Hercules's pillars are;
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>But we this image, O Aratus, gave,
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>Of you who saved us, to the gods who save,
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>By you from exile to our homes restored,
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>That virtue and that justice to record,
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>To which the blessing Sicyon owes this day
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>Of wealth that's shared alike, and laws that all 
<A NAME="342"></A>obey."
<A NAME="343"></A><BR><BR>By his success in effecting these things, Aratus secured himself 
<A NAME="344"></A>from the envy of his fellow-citizens, on account of the benefits they felt 
<A NAME="345"></A>he had done them; but King Antigonus being troubled in his mind about him, 
<A NAME="346"></A>and designing either wholly to bring him over to his party, or else to 
<A NAME="347"></A>make him suspected by Ptolemy, besides other marks of his favour shown 
<A NAME="348"></A>to him, who had little mind to receive them, added this too, that, sacrificing 
<A NAME="349"></A>to the gods in Corinth, he sent portions to Aratus at Sicyon, and at the 
<A NAME="350"></A>feast, where were many guests, he said openly, "I thought this Sicyonian 
<A NAME="351"></A>youth had been only a lover of liberty and of his fellow-citizens, but 
<A NAME="352"></A>now I look upon him as a good judge of the manners and actions of kings. 
<A NAME="353"></A>For formerly he despised us, and, placing his hopes further off, admired 
<A NAME="354"></A>the Egyptian riches, hearing so much of their elephants, fleets, and palaces. 
<A NAME="355"></A>But after seeing all these at a nearer distance, perceiving them to be 
<A NAME="356"></A>but mere stage show and pageantry, he is now come over to us. And for my 
<A NAME="357"></A>part I willingly receive him, and, resolving to make great use of him myself, 
<A NAME="358"></A>command you to look upon him as a friend." These words were soon taken 
<A NAME="359"></A>hold of by those that envied and maligned him, who strove which of them 
<A NAME="360"></A>should, in their letters to Ptolemy, attack him with the worst calumnies, 
<A NAME="361"></A>so that Ptolemy sent to expostulate the matter with him; so much envy and 
<A NAME="362"></A>ill-will did there always attend the so much contended for, and so ardently 
<A NAME="363"></A>and passionately aspired to, friendships of princes and great 
<A NAME="364"></A>men.
<A NAME="365"></A><BR><BR>But Aratus, being now for the first time chosen general of the 
<A NAME="366"></A>Achaeans ravaged the country of Locris and Calydon, just over against Achaea 
<A NAME="367"></A>and then went to assist the Boeotians with ten thousand soldiers, but came 
<A NAME="368"></A>not up to them until after the battle near Chaeronea had been fought, in 
<A NAME="369"></A>which they were beaten by the Aetolians, with the loss of Aboeocritus the 
<A NAME="370"></A>Boeotarch, and a thousand men besides. A year after, being again elected 
<A NAME="371"></A>general, he resolved to attempt the capture of the Acro-Corinthus, not 
<A NAME="372"></A>so much for the advantage of the Sicyonians or Achaeans, as considering 
<A NAME="373"></A>that by expelling the Macedonian garrison he should free all Greece alike 
<A NAME="374"></A>from a tyranny which oppressed every part of her. Chares, the Athenian, 
<A NAME="375"></A>having the good fortune to get the better, in a certain battle, of the 
<A NAME="376"></A>king's generals, wrote to the people of Athens that this victory was "sister 
<A NAME="377"></A>to that at Marathon." And so may this action be very safely termed sister 
<A NAME="378"></A>to those of Pelopidas the Theban and Thrasybulus the Athenian, in which 
<A NAME="379"></A>they slew the tyrants; except, perhaps, it exceed them upon this account, 
<A NAME="380"></A>that it was not against natural Grecians, but against a foreign and stranger 
<A NAME="381"></A>domination. The Isthmus, rising like a bank between the seas, collects 
<A NAME="382"></A>into a single spot and compresses together the whole continent of Greece; 
<A NAME="383"></A>and Acro-Corinthus, being a high mountain springing up out of the very 
<A NAME="384"></A>middle of what here is Greece, whensoever it is held with a garrison, stands 
<A NAME="385"></A>in the way and cuts off all Peloponnesus from intercourse of every kind, 
<A NAME="386"></A>free passage of men and arms, and all traffic by sea and land, and makes 
<A NAME="387"></A>him lord of all that is master of it. Wherefore the younger Philip did 
<A NAME="388"></A>not jest, but said very true, when he called the city of Corinth "the fetters 
<A NAME="389"></A>of Greece." So that this post was always much contended for, especially 
<A NAME="390"></A>by the kings and tyrants; and so vehemently was it longed for by Antigonus, 
<A NAME="391"></A>that his passion for it came little short of that of frantic love; he was 
<A NAME="392"></A>continually occupied with devising how to take it by surprise from those 
<A NAME="393"></A>that were then masters of it, since he despaired to do it by open 
<A NAME="394"></A>force.
<A NAME="395"></A><BR><BR>Therefore Alexander, who held the place, being dead, poisoned by 
<A NAME="396"></A>him, as is reported, and his wife Nicaea succeeding in the government and 
<A NAME="397"></A>the possession of Acro-Corinthus, he immediately made use of his son, Demetrius, 
<A NAME="398"></A>and, giving her pleasing hopes of a royal marriage and of a happy life 
<A NAME="399"></A>with a youth, whom a woman now growing old might well find agreeable, with 
<A NAME="400"></A>this lure of his son he succeeded in taking her; but the place itself she 
<A NAME="401"></A>did not deliver up, but continued to hold it with a very strong garrison, 
<A NAME="402"></A>of which he seeming to take no notice, celebrated the wedding in Corinth, 
<A NAME="403"></A>entertaining them with shows and banquets every day, as one that had nothing 
<A NAME="404"></A>else in his mind but to give himself up for a while to indulgence in pleasure 
<A NAME="405"></A>and mirth. But when the moment came, and Amoebeus began to sing in the 
<A NAME="406"></A>theatre, he waited himself upon Nicaea to the play, she being carried in 
<A NAME="407"></A>a royally decorated chair, extremely pleased with her new honour, not dreaming 
<A NAME="408"></A>of what was intended. As soon, therefore, as they were come to the turning 
<A NAME="409"></A>which led up to the citadel, he desired her to go on before him to the 
<A NAME="410"></A>theatre, but for himself, bidding farewell to the music, farewell to the 
<A NAME="411"></A>wedding, he went on faster than one would have thought his age would have 
<A NAME="412"></A>admitted to the Acro-Corinthus, and, finding the gate shut, knocked with 
<A NAME="413"></A>his staff, commanding them to open, which they within, being amazed, did. 
<A NAME="414"></A>And having thus made himself master of the place, he could not contain 
<A NAME="415"></A>himself for joy; but, though an old man, and one that had seen so many 
<A NAME="416"></A>turns of fortune, he must needs revel it in the open streets and the midst 
<A NAME="417"></A>of the market-place, crowned with garlands and attended with flute-women, 
<A NAME="418"></A>inviting everybody he met to partake in his festivity. So much more does 
<A NAME="419"></A>joy without discretion transport and agitate the mind than either fear 
<A NAME="420"></A>or sorrow. Antigonus, therefore, having in this manner possessed himself 
<A NAME="421"></A>of Acro-Corinthus, put a garrison into it of those he trusted most, making 
<A NAME="422"></A>Persaeus the philosopher governor.
<A NAME="423"></A><BR><BR>Now Aratus, even in the lifetime of Alexander, had made an attempt, 
<A NAME="424"></A>but, a confederacy being made between Alexander and the Achaeans, he desisted. 
<A NAME="425"></A>But now he started afresh, with a new plan of effecting the thing, which 
<A NAME="426"></A>was this: there were in Corinth four brothers, Syrians born, one of whom, 
<A NAME="427"></A>called Diocles, served as a soldier in the garrison, but the three others, 
<A NAME="428"></A>having stolen some gold of the king's, came to Sicyon, to one Aegias, a 
<A NAME="429"></A>banker, whom Aratus made use of in his business. To him they immediately 
<A NAME="430"></A>sold part of their gold, and the rest, one of them, called Erginus, coming 
<A NAME="431"></A>often thither, exchanged by parcels. Becoming, by this means, familiarly 
<A NAME="432"></A>acquainted with Aegias, and being by him led into discourses concerning 
<A NAME="433"></A>the fortress, he told him that in going up to his brother he had observed, 
<A NAME="434"></A>in the face of the rock, a side cleft, leading to that part of the wall 
<A NAME="435"></A>of the castle which was lower than the rest. At which Aegias joking with 
<A NAME="436"></A>him and saying, "So, you wise man, for the sake of a little gold you have 
<A NAME="437"></A>broken into the king's treasure; when you might, if you chose, get money 
<A NAME="438"></A>in abundance for a single hour's work, burglary, you know, and treason 
<A NAME="439"></A>being punished with the same death." Erginus laughed and told him then, 
<A NAME="440"></A>he would break the thing to Diocles (for he did not altogether trust his 
<A NAME="441"></A>other brothers), and, returning within a few days, he bargained to conduct 
<A NAME="442"></A>Aratus to that part of the wall where it was no more than fifteen feet 
<A NAME="443"></A>high, and to do what else should be necessary, together with his brother 
<A NAME="444"></A>Diocles.
<A NAME="445"></A><BR><BR>Aratus, therefore, agreed to give them sixty talents if he succeeded, 
<A NAME="446"></A>but if he failed in his enterprise, and yet he and they came off safe, 
<A NAME="447"></A>then he would give each of them a house and a talent. Now the threescore 
<A NAME="448"></A>talents being to be deposited in the hands of Aegias for Erginus and his 
<A NAME="449"></A>partners, and Aratus neither having so much by him, nor willing, by borrowing 
<A NAME="450"></A>it from others, to give any one a suspicion of his design, he pawned his 
<A NAME="451"></A>plate and his wife's golden ornaments to Aegias for the money. For so high 
<A NAME="452"></A>was his temper, and so strong his passion for noble actions, that, even 
<A NAME="453"></A>as he had heard that Phocion and Epaminondas were the best and justest 
<A NAME="454"></A>of the Greeks, because they refused the greatest presents, and would not 
<A NAME="455"></A>surrender their duty for money, so he now chose to be at the expense of 
<A NAME="456"></A>this enterprise privately, and to advance all the cost out of his own property, 
<A NAME="457"></A>taking the whole hazard on himself for the sake of the rest that did not 
<A NAME="458"></A>so much as know what was doing. And who indeed can withhold, even now, 
<A NAME="459"></A>his admiration for and his sympathy with the generous mind of one, who 
<A NAME="460"></A>paid so largely to purchase so great a risk, and lent out his richest possessions 
<A NAME="461"></A>to have an opportunity to expose his own life, by entering among his enemies 
<A NAME="462"></A>in the dead of the night, without desiring any other security for them 
<A NAME="463"></A>than the hope of a noble success.
<A NAME="464"></A><BR><BR>Now the enterprise, though dangerous enough in itself, was made 
<A NAME="465"></A>much more so by an error happening through mistake in the very beginning. 
<A NAME="466"></A>For Technon, one of Aratus's servants, was sent away to Diocles, that they 
<A NAME="467"></A>might together view the wall. Now he had never seen Diocles, but made no 
<A NAME="468"></A>question of knowing him by the marks Erginus had given him of him; namely, 
<A NAME="469"></A>that he had curly hair, a swarthy complexion, and no beard. Being come, 
<A NAME="470"></A>therefore, to the appointed place, he stayed waiting for Erginus and Diocles 
<A NAME="471"></A>outside the town, in front of the place called Ornis. In the meantime, 
<A NAME="472"></A>Dionysius, elder brother to Erginus and Diocles, who knew nothing at all 
<A NAME="473"></A>of the matter, but much resembled Diocles, happened to pass by. Technon, 
<A NAME="474"></A>upon this likeness, all being in accordance with what he had been told, 
<A NAME="475"></A>asked him if he knew Erginus; and on his replying that he was his brother, 
<A NAME="476"></A>taking it for granted that he was speaking with Diocles, not so much as 
<A NAME="477"></A>asking his name or staying for any other token, he gave him his hand, and 
<A NAME="478"></A>began to discourse with him and ask him questions about matters agreed 
<A NAME="479"></A>upon with Erginus. Dionysius, cunningly taking the advantage of his mistake, 
<A NAME="480"></A>seemed to understand him very well, and returning towards the city, led 
<A NAME="481"></A>him on, still talking, without any suspicion. And being now near the gate, 
<A NAME="482"></A>he was just about to seize on him when by chance again Erginus met them, 
<A NAME="483"></A>and, apprehending the cheat and the danger beckoned to Technon to make 
<A NAME="484"></A>his escape, and immediately both of them, betaking themselves to their 
<A NAME="485"></A>heels, ran away as fast as they could to Aratus, who for all this despaired 
<A NAME="486"></A>not, but immediately sent away Erginus to Dionysius to bribe him to hold 
<A NAME="487"></A>his tongue. And he not only effected that, but also brought him along with 
<A NAME="488"></A>him to Aratus. But when they had him, they no longer left him at liberty, 
<A NAME="489"></A>but binding him, they kept him close shut up in a room, whilst they prepared 
<A NAME="490"></A>for executing their design.
<A NAME="491"></A><BR><BR>All things being now ready, he commanded the rest of his forces 
<A NAME="492"></A>to pass the night by their arms, and taking with him four hundred chosen 
<A NAME="493"></A>men, few of whom knew what they were going about, he led them to the gates 
<A NAME="494"></A>by the temple of Juno. It was the midst of summer and the moon was at full, 
<A NAME="495"></A>and the night so clear without any clouds, that there was danger lest the 
<A NAME="496"></A>arms glistening in the moonlight should discover them. But as the foremost 
<A NAME="497"></A>of them came near the city, a mist came off from the sea, and darkened 
<A NAME="498"></A>the city itself and the outskirts about it. Then the rest of them, sitting 
<A NAME="499"></A>down, put off their shoes, because men both make less noise and also climb 
<A NAME="500"></A>surer if they go up ladders barefooted, but Erginus, taking with him seven 
<A NAME="501"></A>young men dressed like travellers, got unobserved to the gate, and killed 
<A NAME="502"></A>the sentry with the other guards. And at the same time the ladders were 
<A NAME="503"></A>clapped to the walls, and Aratus, having in great haste got up a hundred 
<A NAME="504"></A>men, commanded the rest to follow as they could, and immediately drawing 
<A NAME="505"></A>up his ladders after him, he marched through the city with his hundred 
<A NAME="506"></A>men towards the castle, being already overjoyed that he was undiscovered, 
<A NAME="507"></A>and not doubting of the success. But while still they were some way off, 
<A NAME="508"></A>a watch of four men came with a light, who did not see them, because they 
<A NAME="509"></A>were still in the shade of the moon, but were seen plainly enough themselves 
<A NAME="510"></A>as they came on directly towards them. So withdrawing a little way amongst 
<A NAME="511"></A>some walls and plots for houses, they lay in wait for them; and three of 
<A NAME="512"></A>them they killed. But the fourth, being wounded in the head with a sword, 
<A NAME="513"></A>fled, crying out that the enemy was in the city. And immediately the trumpets 
<A NAME="514"></A>sounded, and all the city was in an uproar at what had happened, and the 
<A NAME="515"></A>streets were full of people running up and down, and many lights were seen 
<A NAME="516"></A>shining both below in the town, and above in the castle, and a confused 
<A NAME="517"></A>noise was to be heard in all parts.
<A NAME="518"></A><BR><BR>In the meantime, Aratus was hard at work struggling to get up the 
<A NAME="519"></A>rocks, at first slowly and with much difficulty, straying continually from 
<A NAME="520"></A>the path, which lay deep, and was overshadowed with the crags, leading 
<A NAME="521"></A>to the wall with many windings and turnings; but the moon immediately, 
<A NAME="522"></A>and as if by miracle, it is said, dispersing the clouds, shone out and 
<A NAME="523"></A>gave light to the most difficult part of the way, until he got to that 
<A NAME="524"></A>part of the wall he desired, and there she overshadowed and hid him, the 
<A NAME="525"></A>clouds coming together again. Those soldiers whom Aratus had left outside 
<A NAME="526"></A>the gate, near Juno's temple, to the number of three hundred, entering 
<A NAME="527"></A>the town, now full of tumult and lights, and not knowing the way by which 
<A NAME="528"></A>the former had gone, and finding no track of them, slunk aside, and crowded 
<A NAME="529"></A>together in one body under a flank of the cliff that cast a strong shadow, 
<A NAME="530"></A>and there stood and waited in great distress and perplexity. For, by this 
<A NAME="531"></A>time, those that had gone with Aratus were attacked with missiles from 
<A NAME="532"></A>the citadel, and were busy fighting, and a sound of cries of battle came 
<A NAME="533"></A>down from above, and a loud noise, echoed back and back from the mountain 
<A NAME="534"></A>sides, and therefore confused and uncertain whence it proceeded, was heard 
<A NAME="535"></A>on all sides. They being thus in doubt which way to turn themselves, Archelaus, 
<A NAME="536"></A>the commander of Antigonus's troops, having a great number of soldiers 
<A NAME="537"></A>with him, made up towards the castle with great shouts and noise of trumpets 
<A NAME="538"></A>to fall upon Aratus's people, and passed by the three hundred, who, as 
<A NAME="539"></A>if they had risen out of an ambush, immediately charged him, killing the 
<A NAME="540"></A>first they encountered, and so affrighted the rest, together with Archelaus, 
<A NAME="541"></A>that they put them to flight and pursued them until they had quite broken 
<A NAME="542"></A>and dispersed them about the city. No sooner were these defeated, but Erginus 
<A NAME="543"></A>came to them from those that were fighting above, to acquaint them that 
<A NAME="544"></A>Aratus was engaged with the enemy, who defended themselves very stoutly, 
<A NAME="545"></A>and there was a fierce conflict at the very wall, and need of speedy help. 
<A NAME="546"></A>They therefore desired him to lead them on without delay, and, marching 
<A NAME="547"></A>up, by their shouts made their friends understand who they were, and encouraged 
<A NAME="548"></A>them; and the full moon, shining on their arms, made them, in the long 
<A NAME="549"></A>line by which they advanced, appear more in number to the enemy than they 
<A NAME="550"></A>were; and the echo of the night multiplied their shouts. In short, falling 
<A NAME="551"></A>on with the rest, they made the enemy give way, and were masters of the 
<A NAME="552"></A>castle and garrison, day now beginning to be bright, and the rising sun 
<A NAME="553"></A>shining out upon their success. By this time, also, the rest of his army 
<A NAME="554"></A>came up to Aratus from Sicyon, the Corinthians joyfully receiving them 
<A NAME="555"></A>at the gates and helping them to secure the king's party.
<A NAME="556"></A><BR><BR>And now, having put all things into a safe posture, he came down 
<A NAME="557"></A>from the castle to the theatre, an infinite number of people crowding thither 
<A NAME="558"></A>to see him and to hear what he would say to the Corinthians. Therefore 
<A NAME="559"></A>drawing up the Achaeans on each side of the stage-passages, he came forward 
<A NAME="560"></A>himself upon the stage, with his corselet still on, and his face showing 
<A NAME="561"></A>the effects of all his hard work and want of sleep, so that his natural 
<A NAME="562"></A>exultation and joyfulness of mind were overborne by the weariness of his 
<A NAME="563"></A>body. The people, as soon as he came forth, breaking out into great applauses 
<A NAME="564"></A>and congratulations, he took his spear in his right hand, and, resting 
<A NAME="565"></A>his body upon it with his knee a little bent, stood a good while in that 
<A NAME="566"></A>posture, silently receiving their shouts and acclamations, while they extolled 
<A NAME="567"></A>his valour and wondered at his fortune; which being over, standing up, 
<A NAME="568"></A>he began an oration in the name of the Achaeans, suitable to the late action, 
<A NAME="569"></A>persuading the Corinthians to associate themselves to the Achaeans, and 
<A NAME="570"></A>withal delivered up to them the keys of their gates, which had never been 
<A NAME="571"></A>in their power since the time of King Philip. Of the captains of Antigonus, 
<A NAME="572"></A>he dismissed Archelaus, whom he had taken prisoner, and Theophrastus, who 
<A NAME="573"></A>refused to quit his post, he put to death. As for Persaeus, when he saw 
<A NAME="574"></A>the castle was lost, he had got away to Cenchreae, where, some time after, 
<A NAME="575"></A>discoursing with one that said to him that the wise man only is a true 
<A NAME="576"></A>general, "Indeed," he replied, "none of Zeno's maxims once pleased me better 
<A NAME="577"></A>than this, but I have been converted to another opinion by the young man 
<A NAME="578"></A>of Sicyon." This is told by many of Persaeus. Aratus immediately after 
<A NAME="579"></A>made himself master of the temple of Juno and haven of Lechaeum, seized 
<A NAME="580"></A>upon five-and-twenty of the king's ships, together with five hundred horses 
<A NAME="581"></A>and four hundred Syrians: these he sold. The Achaeans kept guard in the 
<A NAME="582"></A>Acro-Corinthus with a body of four hundred soldiers, and fifty dogs with 
<A NAME="583"></A>as many keepers.
<A NAME="584"></A><BR><BR>The Romans, extolling Philopoemen, called him the last of the Grecians, 
<A NAME="585"></A>as if no great man had ever since his time been bred amongst them. But 
<A NAME="586"></A>I should call this capture of the Acro-Corinthus the last of the Grecian 
<A NAME="587"></A>exploits, being comparable to the best of them, both for the daringness 
<A NAME="588"></A>of it, and the success, as was presently seen by the consequences. For 
<A NAME="589"></A>the Megarians, revolting from Antigonus, joined Aratus, and the Troezenians 
<A NAME="590"></A>and Epidaurians enrolled themselves in the Achaean community, and issuing 
<A NAME="591"></A>forth for the first time, he entered Attica, and passing over into Salamis, 
<A NAME="592"></A>he plundered the island, turning the Achaean force every way, as if it 
<A NAME="593"></A>were just let loose out of prison and set at liberty. All freemen whom 
<A NAME="594"></A>he took he sent back to the Athenians without ransom, as a sort of first 
<A NAME="595"></A>invitation to them to come over to the league. He made Ptolemy become a 
<A NAME="596"></A>confederate of the Achaeans, with the privilege of command both by sea 
<A NAME="597"></A>and land. And so great was his power with them, that since he could not 
<A NAME="598"></A>by law be chosen their general every year, yet every other year he was, 
<A NAME="599"></A>and by his counsels and actions was in effect always so. For they perceived 
<A NAME="600"></A>that neither riches nor reputation, nor the friendship of kings, nor the 
<A NAME="601"></A>private interest of his own country, nor anything else was so dear to him 
<A NAME="602"></A>as the increase of the Achaeans' power and greatness. For he believed that 
<A NAME="603"></A>the cities, weak individually, could be preserved by nothing else but a 
<A NAME="604"></A>mutual assistance under the closest bond of the common interest, and, as 
<A NAME="605"></A>the members of the body live and breathe by the union of all in a single 
<A NAME="606"></A>natural growth, and on the dissolution of this, when once they separate, 
<A NAME="607"></A>pine away and putrefy, in the same manner are cities ruined by being dissevered, 
<A NAME="608"></A>as well as preserved when, as the members of one great body, they enjoy 
<A NAME="609"></A>the benefit of that province and counsel that govern the 
<A NAME="610"></A>whole.
<A NAME="611"></A><BR><BR>Now being distressed to see that, whereas the chief neighbouring 
<A NAME="612"></A>cities enjoyed their own laws and liberties, the Argives were in bondage, 
<A NAME="613"></A>he took counsel for destroying their tyrant, Aristomachus, being very desirous 
<A NAME="614"></A>both to pay his debt of gratitude to the city where he had been bred up, 
<A NAME="615"></A>by restoring it its liberty, and to add so considerable a town to the Achaeans. 
<A NAME="616"></A>Nor were there some wanting who had the courage to undertake the thing, 
<A NAME="617"></A>of whom Aeschylus and Charimenes the soothsayer were the chief. But they 
<A NAME="618"></A>wanted swords; for the tyrant had prohibited the keeping of any under a 
<A NAME="619"></A>great penalty. Therefore Aratus, having provided some small daggers at 
<A NAME="620"></A>Corinth and hidden them in the pack-saddles of some pack-horses that carried 
<A NAME="621"></A>ordinary ware, sent them to Argos. But Charimenes letting another person 
<A NAME="622"></A>into the design, Aeschylus and his partners were angry at it, and henceforth 
<A NAME="623"></A>would have no more to do with him, and took their measures by themselves, 
<A NAME="624"></A>and Charimenes, on finding this, went, out of anger, and informed against 
<A NAME="625"></A>them, just as they were on their way to attack the tyrant; however, the 
<A NAME="626"></A>most of them made a shift to escape out of the market-place, and fled to 
<A NAME="627"></A>Corinth. Not long after, Aristomachus was slain by some slaves, and Aristippus, 
<A NAME="628"></A>a worse tyrant than he, seized the government. Upon this, Aratus, mustering 
<A NAME="629"></A>all the Achaeans present that were of age, hurried away to the aid of the 
<A NAME="630"></A>city, believing that he should find the people ready to join with him. 
<A NAME="631"></A>But the greater number being by this time habituated to slavery and content 
<A NAME="632"></A>to submit, and no one coming to join him, he was obliged to retire, having 
<A NAME="633"></A>moreover exposed the Achaeans to the charge of committing acts of hostility 
<A NAME="634"></A>in the midst of peace; upon which account they were sued before the Mantineans, 
<A NAME="635"></A>and, Aratus not making his appearance, Aristippus gained the cause, and 
<A NAME="636"></A>had damages allowed him to the value of thirty minae. And now hating and 
<A NAME="637"></A>fearing Aratus, he sought means to kill him, having the assistance herein 
<A NAME="638"></A>of King Antigonus; so that Aratus was perpetually dogged and watched by 
<A NAME="639"></A>those that waited for an opportunity to do this service. But there is no 
<A NAME="640"></A>such safeguard of a ruler as the sincere and steady good-will of his subjects, 
<A NAME="641"></A>for where both the common people and the principal citizens have their 
<A NAME="642"></A>fears not of, but for, their governor, he sees with many eyes and hears 
<A NAME="643"></A>with many ears whatsoever is doing. Therefore I cannot but here stop short 
<A NAME="644"></A>a little in the course of my narrative to describe the manner of life which 
<A NAME="645"></A>the so much envied arbitrary power and the so much celebrated and admired 
<A NAME="646"></A>pomp and pride of absolute government obliged Aristippus to 
<A NAME="647"></A>lead.
<A NAME="648"></A><BR><BR>For though Antigonus was his friend and ally, and though he maintained 
<A NAME="649"></A>numerous soldiers to act as his body-guard, and had not left one enemy 
<A NAME="650"></A>of his alive in the city, yet he was forced to make his guards encamp in 
<A NAME="651"></A>the colonnade about his house; and for his servants, he turned them all 
<A NAME="652"></A>out immediately after supper, and then shutting the doors upon them, he 
<A NAME="653"></A>crept up into a small upper chamber, together with his mistress, through 
<A NAME="654"></A>a trap-door, upon which he placed his bed, and there slept after such a 
<A NAME="655"></A>fashion, as one in his condition can be supposed to sleep, that is, interruptedly 
<A NAME="656"></A>and in fear. The ladder was taken away by the woman's mother, and locked 
<A NAME="657"></A>up in another room; in the morning she brought it again, and putting it 
<A NAME="658"></A>to, called up this brave and wonderful tyrant, who came crawling out like 
<A NAME="659"></A>some creeping thing out of its hole. Whereas Aratus, not by force of arms, 
<A NAME="660"></A>but lawfully and by his virtue, lived in possession of a firmly settled 
<A NAME="661"></A>command, wearing the ordinary coat and cloak, being the common and declared 
<A NAME="662"></A>enemy of all tyrants, and has left behind him a noble race of descendants 
<A NAME="663"></A>surviving among the Grecians to this day; while those occupiers of citadels 
<A NAME="664"></A>and maintainers of body-guards, who made all this use of arms and gates 
<A NAME="665"></A>and bolts to protect their lives, in some few cases perhaps escaped like 
<A NAME="666"></A>the bare from the hunters; but in no instance have we either house or family, 
<A NAME="667"></A>or so much as a tomb to which any respect is shown, remaining to preserve 
<A NAME="668"></A>the memory of any one of them.
<A NAME="669"></A><BR><BR>Against this Aristippus, therefore, Aratus made many open and many 
<A NAME="670"></A>secret attempts, whilst he endeavoured to take Argos, though without success; 
<A NAME="671"></A>once, particularly, clapping scaling ladders in the night to the walls, 
<A NAME="672"></A>he desperately got up upon it with a few of his soldiers, and killed the 
<A NAME="673"></A>guards that opposed him. But the day appearing, the tyrant set upon him 
<A NAME="674"></A>on all hands, whilst the Argives, as if it had not been their liberty that 
<A NAME="675"></A>was contended for, but some Nemean game going on for which it was their 
<A NAME="676"></A>privilege to assign the prize, like fair and impartial judges, sat looking 
<A NAME="677"></A>on in great quietness. Aratus, fighting bravely, was run through the thigh 
<A NAME="678"></A>with a lance, yet he maintained his ground against the enemy till night, 
<A NAME="679"></A>and, had he been able to go on and hold out that night also, he had gained 
<A NAME="680"></A>his point; for the tyrant thought of nothing but flying, and had already 
<A NAME="681"></A>shipped most of his goods. But Aratus, having no intelligence of this, 
<A NAME="682"></A>and wanting water, being disabled himself by his wound, retreated with 
<A NAME="683"></A>his soldiers.
<A NAME="684"></A><BR><BR>Despairing henceforth to do any good this way, he fell openly with 
<A NAME="685"></A>his army into Argolis, and plundered it, and in a fierce battle with Aristippus 
<A NAME="686"></A>near the river Chares, he was accused of having withdrawn out of the fight, 
<A NAME="687"></A>and thereby abandoned the victory. For whereas one part of his army had 
<A NAME="688"></A>unmistakably got the better, and was pursuing the enemy at a good distance 
<A NAME="689"></A>from him, he yet retreated in confusion into his camp, not so much because 
<A NAME="690"></A>he was overpressed by those with whom he was engaged, as out of mistrust 
<A NAME="691"></A>of success and through a panic fear. But when the other wing, returning 
<A NAME="692"></A>from the pursuit, showed themselves extremely vexed, that though they had 
<A NAME="693"></A>put the enemy to flight and killed many more of his men than they had lost, 
<A NAME="694"></A>yet those that were in a manner conquered should erect a trophy as conquerors, 
<A NAME="695"></A>being much ashamed he resolved to fight them again about the trophy, and 
<A NAME="696"></A>the next day but one drew up his army to give them battle. But, perceiving 
<A NAME="697"></A>that they were reinforced with fresh troops, and came on with better courage 
<A NAME="698"></A>than before, he durst not hazard a fight, but retired and sent to request 
<A NAME="699"></A>a truce to bury his dead. However, by his dexterity in dealing personally 
<A NAME="700"></A>with men and managing political affairs, and by his general favour, he 
<A NAME="701"></A>excused and obliterated this fault, and brought in Cleonae to the Achaean 
<A NAME="702"></A>association, and celebrated the Nemean games at Cleonae, as the proper 
<A NAME="703"></A>and more ancient place for them. The games were also celebrated by the 
<A NAME="704"></A>Argives at the same time, which gave the first occasion to the violation 
<A NAME="705"></A>of the privilege of safe conduct and immunity always granted to those that 
<A NAME="706"></A>came to compete for the prizes, the Achaeans at that time selling as enemies 
<A NAME="707"></A>all those they caught going through their country after joining in the 
<A NAME="708"></A>games at Argos. So vehement and implacable a hater was he of the 
<A NAME="709"></A>tyrants.
<A NAME="710"></A><BR><BR>Not long after, having notice that Aristippus had a design upon 
<A NAME="711"></A>Cleonae, but was afraid of him, because he then was staying in Corinth, 
<A NAME="712"></A>he assembled an army by public proclamation, and commanding them to take 
<A NAME="713"></A>along with them provisions for several days, he marched to Cenchreae, hoping 
<A NAME="714"></A>by this stratagem to entice Aristippus to fall upon Cleonae, when he supposed 
<A NAME="715"></A>him far enough off. And so it happened, for he immediately brought his 
<A NAME="716"></A>forces against it from Argos. But Aratus, returning from Cenchreae to Corinth 
<A NAME="717"></A>in the dusk of the evening, and setting posts of his troops in all the 
<A NAME="718"></A>roads, led on the Achaeans, who followed in such good order and with so 
<A NAME="719"></A>much speed and alacrity, that they were undiscovered by Aristippus, not 
<A NAME="720"></A>only whilst upon their march, but even when they got, still in the night, 
<A NAME="721"></A>into Cleonae, and drew up in order of battle. As soon as it was morning, 
<A NAME="722"></A>the gates being opened and the trumpets sounding, he fell upon the enemy 
<A NAME="723"></A>with great cries and fury, routed them at once, and kept close in pursuit, 
<A NAME="724"></A>following the course which he most imagined Aristippus would choose, there 
<A NAME="725"></A>being many turns that might be taken. And so the chase lasted as far as 
<A NAME="726"></A>Mycenae, where the tyrant was slain by a certain Cretan called Tragiscus, 
<A NAME="727"></A>as Dinias reports. Of the common soldiers, there fell above fifteen hundred. 
<A NAME="728"></A>Yet though Aratus had obtained so great a victory and that too without 
<A NAME="729"></A>the loss of a man, he could not make himself master of Argos, nor set it 
<A NAME="730"></A>at liberty, because Agias and the younger Aristomachus got into the town 
<A NAME="731"></A>with some of the king's forces, and seized upon the government. However, 
<A NAME="732"></A>by this exploit he spoiled the scoffs and jests of those that flattered 
<A NAME="733"></A>the tyrants, and in their raillery would say that the Achaean general was 
<A NAME="734"></A>usually troubled with a looseness when he was to fight a battle, that the 
<A NAME="735"></A>sound of a trumpet struck him with a drowsiness and a giddiness, and that 
<A NAME="736"></A>when he had drawn up his army and given the word, he used to ask his lieutenants 
<A NAME="737"></A>and officers whether there was any further need of his presence now the 
<A NAME="738"></A>die was cast, and then went aloof, to await the result at a distance. For 
<A NAME="739"></A>indeed these stories were so generally listened to, that, when the philosophers 
<A NAME="740"></A>disputed whether to have one's heart beat and to change colour upon any 
<A NAME="741"></A>apparent danger be an argument of fear, or rather of some distemperature 
<A NAME="742"></A>and chilliness of bodily constitution, Aratus was always quoted as a good 
<A NAME="743"></A>general who was always thus affected in time of battle.
<A NAME="744"></A><BR><BR>Having thus despatched Aristippus, he advised with himself how 
<A NAME="745"></A>to overthrow Lydiades, the Megalopolitan, who held usurped power over his 
<A NAME="746"></A>country. This person was naturally of a generous temper, and not insensible 
<A NAME="747"></A>of true honour, and had been led into this wickedness, not by the ordinary 
<A NAME="748"></A>motives of other tyrants, licentiousness and rapacity, but being young, 
<A NAME="749"></A>and stimulated with the desire of glory, he had let his mind be unwarily 
<A NAME="750"></A>prepossessed with the vain and false applauses given to tyranny, as some 
<A NAME="751"></A>happy and glorious thing. But he no sooner seized the government, than 
<A NAME="752"></A>he grew weary of the pomp and burden of it. And at once emulating the tranquillity 
<A NAME="753"></A>and fearing the policy of Aratus, he took the best resolutions, first, 
<A NAME="754"></A>to free himself from hatred and fear, from soldiers and guards, and, secondly, 
<A NAME="755"></A>to be the public benefactor of his country. And sending for Aratus, he 
<A NAME="756"></A>resigned the government, and incorporated his city into the Achaean community. 
<A NAME="757"></A>The Achaeans, applauding this generous action, chose him their general; 
<A NAME="758"></A>upon which, desiring to outdo Aratus in glory, amongst many other uncalled-for 
<A NAME="759"></A>things, he declared war against the Lacedaemonians; which Aratus opposing 
<A NAME="760"></A>was thought to do it out of envy; and Lydiades was the second time chosen 
<A NAME="761"></A>general, though Aratus acted openly against him, and laboured to have the 
<A NAME="762"></A>office conferred upon another. For Aratus himself had the command every 
<A NAME="763"></A>other year, as has been said. Lydiades, however, succeeded so well in his 
<A NAME="764"></A>pretensions, that he was thrice chosen general, governing alternately, 
<A NAME="765"></A>as did Aratus; but at last, declaring himself his professed enemy, and 
<A NAME="766"></A>accusing him frequently to the Achaeans, he was rejected, and fell into 
<A NAME="767"></A>contempt, people now seeing that it was a contest between a counterfeit 
<A NAME="768"></A>and a true, unadulterated virtue, and, as Aesop tells us that the cuckoo 
<A NAME="769"></A>once, asking the little birds why they flew away from her, was answered, 
<A NAME="770"></A>because they feared she would one day prove a hawk, so Lydiades's former 
<A NAME="771"></A>tyranny still cast a doubt upon the reality of his change.
<A NAME="772"></A><BR><BR>But Aratus gained new honour in the Aetolian war. For the Achaeans 
<A NAME="773"></A>resolving to fall upon the Aetolians on the Megarian confines, and Agis 
<A NAME="774"></A>also, the Lacedaemonian king, who came to their assistance with an army, 
<A NAME="775"></A>encouraging them to fight, Aratus opposed this determination. And patiently 
<A NAME="776"></A>enduring many reproaches, many scoffs and jeerings at his soft and cowardly 
<A NAME="777"></A>temper, he would not, for any appearance of disgrace, abandon what he judged 
<A NAME="778"></A>to be true common advantage, and suffered the enemy to pass over Geranea 
<A NAME="779"></A>into Peloponnesus without a battle. But when, after they passed by, news 
<A NAME="780"></A>came that they had suddenly captured Pellene, he was no longer the same 
<A NAME="781"></A>man, nor would he hear of any delay, or wait to draw together his whole 
<A NAME="782"></A>force, but marched towards the enemy, with such as he had about him, to 
<A NAME="783"></A>fall upon them, as they were indeed now much less formidable through the 
<A NAME="784"></A>intemperances and disorders committed in their success. For as soon as 
<A NAME="785"></A>they entered the city, the common soldiers dispersed and went hither and 
<A NAME="786"></A>thither into the houses, quarrelling and fighting with one another about 
<A NAME="787"></A>the plunder, and the officers and commanders were running about after the 
<A NAME="788"></A>wives and daughters of the Pellenians, on whose heads they put their own 
<A NAME="789"></A>helmets, to mark each man his prize, and prevent another from seizing it. 
<A NAME="790"></A>And in this posture were they when news came that Aratus was ready to fall 
<A NAME="791"></A>upon them. And in the midst of the consternation likely to ensue in the 
<A NAME="792"></A>confusion they were in before all of them heard of the danger, the outmost 
<A NAME="793"></A>of them, engaging at the gates and in the suburbs with the Achaeans, were 
<A NAME="794"></A>already beaten and put to flight, and as they came headlong back, filled 
<A NAME="795"></A>with their panic those who were collecting and advancing to their 
<A NAME="796"></A>assistance.
<A NAME="797"></A><BR><BR>In this confusion, one of the captives, daughter of Epigethes, 
<A NAME="798"></A>a citizen of repute, being extremely handsome and tall, happened to be 
<A NAME="799"></A>sitting in the temple of Diana, placed there by the commander of the band 
<A NAME="800"></A>of chosen men, who had taken her and put his crested helmet upon her. She, 
<A NAME="801"></A>hearing the noise, and running out to see what was the matter, stood in 
<A NAME="802"></A>the temple gates, looking down from above upon those that fought, having 
<A NAME="803"></A>the helmet upon her head; in which posture she seemed to the citizens to 
<A NAME="804"></A>be something more than human, and struck fear and dread into the enemy, 
<A NAME="805"></A>who believed it to be a divine apparition; so that they lost all courage 
<A NAME="806"></A>to defend themselves. But the Pellenians tell us that the image of Diana 
<A NAME="807"></A>stands usually untouched, and when the priestess happens at any time to 
<A NAME="808"></A>remove it to some other place, nobody dares look upon it, but all turn 
<A NAME="809"></A>their faces from it; for not only is the sight of it terrible and hurtful 
<A NAME="810"></A>to mankind, but it makes even the trees, by which it happens to be carried, 
<A NAME="811"></A>become barren and cast fruit. This image, therefore, they say, the priestess 
<A NAME="812"></A>produced at that time, and holding it directly in the faces of the Aetolians, 
<A NAME="813"></A>made them lose their reason and judgment. But Aratus mentions no such thing 
<A NAME="814"></A>in his commentaries, but saying that having put to flight the Aetolians, 
<A NAME="815"></A>and falling in pell-mell with them into the city, he drove them out by 
<A NAME="816"></A>main force, and killed seven hundred of them. And the action was extolled 
<A NAME="817"></A>as one of the most famous exploits, and Timanthes the painter made a picture 
<A NAME="818"></A>of the battle, giving by his composition a most lively representation of 
<A NAME="819"></A>it.
<A NAME="820"></A><BR><BR>But many great nations and potentates combining against the Achaeans, 
<A NAME="821"></A>Aratus immediately for friendly arrangements with the Aetolians, and, making 
<A NAME="822"></A>use of the assistance of Pantaleon, the most powerful man amongst them, 
<A NAME="823"></A>he not only made a peace, but an alliance between them and the Achaeans. 
<A NAME="824"></A>But being desirous to free the Athenians, he got into disgrace and ill-repute 
<A NAME="825"></A>among the Achaeans, because, notwithstanding the truce and suspension of 
<A NAME="826"></A>arms made between them and the Macedonians, he had attempted to take the 
<A NAME="827"></A>Piraeus. He denies this fact in his commentaries, and lays the blame on 
<A NAME="828"></A>Erginus, by whose assistance he took Acro-Corinthus, alleging that he upon 
<A NAME="829"></A>his own private account attacked the Piraeus, and his ladders happening 
<A NAME="830"></A>to break, being hotly pursued, he called out upon Aratus, as if present, 
<A NAME="831"></A>by which means deceiving the enemy he got safely off. This excuse, however, 
<A NAME="832"></A>sounds very improbable; for it is not in any way likely that Erginus, a 
<A NAME="833"></A>private man and a Syrian stranger, should conceive in his mind so great 
<A NAME="834"></A>an attempt, without Aratus at his back, to tell him how and when to make 
<A NAME="835"></A>it, and to supply him with the means. Nor was it twice or thrice, but very 
<A NAME="836"></A>often, that, like an obstinate lover, he repeated his attempts on the Piraeus, 
<A NAME="837"></A>and was so far from being discouraged by his disappointments, that his 
<A NAME="838"></A>missing his hopes but narrowly was an incentive to him to proceed the more 
<A NAME="839"></A>boldly in a new trial. One time amongst the rest, in making his escape 
<A NAME="840"></A>through the Thrasian plain, he put his leg out of joint, and was forced 
<A NAME="841"></A>to submit to many operations with the knife before he was cured, so that 
<A NAME="842"></A>for a long time he was carried in a litter to the wars.
<A NAME="843"></A><BR><BR>And when Antigonus was dead, and Demetrius succeeded him in the 
<A NAME="844"></A>kingdom, he was more bent than ever upon Athens, and in general quite despised 
<A NAME="845"></A>the Macedonians. And so, being overthrown in battle near Phylacia by Bithys, 
<A NAME="846"></A>Demetrius's general, and there being a very strong report that he was either 
<A NAME="847"></A>taken or slain, Diogenes, the governor of the Piraeus, sent letters to 
<A NAME="848"></A>Corinth, commanding the Achaeans to quit that city, seeing Aratus was dead. 
<A NAME="849"></A>When these letters came to Corinth, Aratus happened to be there in person, 
<A NAME="850"></A>so that Diogenes's messengers being sufficiently mocked and derided, were 
<A NAME="851"></A>forced to return to their master. King Demetrius himself also sent a ship, 
<A NAME="852"></A>wherein Aratus was to be brought to him in chains. And the Athenians, exceeding 
<A NAME="853"></A>all possible fickleness of flattery to the Macedonians, crowned themselves 
<A NAME="854"></A>with garlands upon the first news of his death. And so in anger he went 
<A NAME="855"></A>at once and invaded Attica, and penetrated as far as the Academy, but then 
<A NAME="856"></A>suffering himself to be pacified he did no further act of hostility. And 
<A NAME="857"></A>the Athenians afterwards, coming to a due sense of his virtue when upon 
<A NAME="858"></A>the death of Demetrius they attempted to recover their liberty, called 
<A NAME="859"></A>him to their assistance; although at that time another person was general 
<A NAME="860"></A>of the Achaeans, and he himself had long kept his bed with a sickness, 
<A NAME="861"></A>yet rather than fail the city in a time of need, he was carried thither 
<A NAME="862"></A>in a litter, and helped to persuade Diogenes the governor to deliver up 
<A NAME="863"></A>the Piraeus, Munychia, Salamis, and Sunium to the Athenians in consideration 
<A NAME="864"></A>of a hundred and fifty talents, of which Aratus himself contributed twenty 
<A NAME="865"></A>to the city. Upon this, the Aeginetans and the Hermionians immediately 
<A NAME="866"></A>joined the Achaeans, and the greatest part of Arcadia entered their confederacy; 
<A NAME="867"></A>and the Macedonians being occupied with various wars upon their own confines 
<A NAME="868"></A>and with their neighbours, the Achaean power, the Aetolians also being 
<A NAME="869"></A>in alliance with them, rose to great height.
<A NAME="870"></A><BR><BR>But Aratus, still bent on effecting his old project, and impatient 
<A NAME="871"></A>that tyranny should maintain itself in so near a city as Argos, sent to 
<A NAME="872"></A>Aristomachus to persuade him to restore liberty to that city, and to associate 
<A NAME="873"></A>it to the Achaeans, and that, following Lydiades's example, he should rather 
<A NAME="874"></A>choose to be the general of a great nation, with esteem and honour, than 
<A NAME="875"></A>the tyrant of one city, with continual hatred and danger. Aristomachus 
<A NAME="876"></A>slighted not the message, but desired Aratus to send him fifty talents, 
<A NAME="877"></A>with which he might pay off the soldiers. In the meantime, whilst the money 
<A NAME="878"></A>was providing, Lydiades, being then general, and extremely ambitious that 
<A NAME="879"></A>this advantage might seem to be of his procuring for the Achaeans, accused 
<A NAME="880"></A>Aratus to Aristomachus, as one that bore an irreconcilable hatred to the 
<A NAME="881"></A>tyrants, and, persuading him to commit the affair to his management, he 
<A NAME="882"></A>presented him to the Achaeans. But there the Achaean council gave a manifest 
<A NAME="883"></A>proof of the great credit Aratus had with them and the good-will they bore 
<A NAME="884"></A>him. For when he, in anger, spoke against Aristomachus's being admitted 
<A NAME="885"></A>into the association, they rejected the proposal, but when he was afterwards 
<A NAME="886"></A>pacified and came himself and spoke in its favour, they voted everything 
<A NAME="887"></A>cheerfully and readily, and decreed that the Argives and Phliasians should 
<A NAME="888"></A>be incorporated into their commonwealth, and the next year they chose Aristomachus 
<A NAME="889"></A>general. He, being in good credit with the Achaeans, was very desirous 
<A NAME="890"></A>to invade Laconia, and for that purpose sent for Aratus from Athens. Aratus 
<A NAME="891"></A>wrote to him to dissuade him as far as he could from that expedition, being 
<A NAME="892"></A>very unwilling the Achaeans should be engaged in a quarrel with Cleomenes, 
<A NAME="893"></A>who was a daring man, and making extraordinary advances to power. But Aristomachus 
<A NAME="894"></A>resolving to go on, he obeyed and served in person, on which occasion he 
<A NAME="895"></A>hindered Aristomachus from fighting a battle when Cleomenes came upon them 
<A NAME="896"></A>at Pallantium; and for this act was accused by Lydiades, and, coming to 
<A NAME="897"></A>an open conflict with him in a contest for the office of general, he carried 
<A NAME="898"></A>it by the show of hands, and was chosen general the twelfth 
<A NAME="899"></A>time.
<A NAME="900"></A><BR><BR>This year, being routed by Cleomenes, near the Lycaeum, he fled, 
<A NAME="901"></A>and, wandering out of the way in the night, was believed to be slain; and 
<A NAME="902"></A>once more it was confidently reported so throughout all Greece. He, however, 
<A NAME="903"></A>having escaped this danger and rallied his forces, was not content to march 
<A NAME="904"></A>off in safety, but making a happy use of the present conjuncture, when 
<A NAME="905"></A>nobody dreamed of any such thing, he fell suddenly upon the Mantineans, 
<A NAME="906"></A>allies of Cleomenes, and, taking the city, put a garrison into it, and 
<A NAME="907"></A>made the stranger inhabitants free of the city; procuring, by this means, 
<A NAME="908"></A>those advantages for the beaten Achaeans, which being conquerors, they 
<A NAME="909"></A>would not easily have obtained. The Lacedaemonians again invading the Megalopolitan 
<A NAME="910"></A>territories, he marched to the assistance of the city, but refused to give 
<A NAME="911"></A>Cleomenes, who did all he could to provoke him to it, opportunity of engaging 
<A NAME="912"></A>him in a battle, nor could be prevailed upon by the Megalopolitans, who 
<A NAME="913"></A>urged him to it extremely. For besides that by nature he was ill-suited 
<A NAME="914"></A>for set battles, he was then much inferior in numbers, and was to deal 
<A NAME="915"></A>with a daring leader, still in the heat of youth, while he himself, now 
<A NAME="916"></A>past the prime of courage and come to a chastised ambition, felt it his 
<A NAME="917"></A>business to maintain by prudence the glory which he had obtained, and the 
<A NAME="918"></A>other was only aspiring to by forwardness and daring.
<A NAME="919"></A><BR><BR>So that though the light-armed soldiers had sallied out and driven 
<A NAME="920"></A>the Lacedaemonians as far as their camp, and had come even to their tents, 
<A NAME="921"></A>yet would not Aratus lead his men forward, but, posting himself in a hollow 
<A NAME="922"></A>water-course in the way thither, stopped and prevented the citizens from 
<A NAME="923"></A>crossing this. Lydiades, extremely vexed at what was going on, and loading 
<A NAME="924"></A>Aratus with reproaches, entreated the horse that, together with him, they 
<A NAME="925"></A>would second them that had the enemy in chase, and not let a certain victory 
<A NAME="926"></A>slip out of their hands, nor forsake him that was going to venture his 
<A NAME="927"></A>life for his country. And being reinforced with many brave men that turned 
<A NAME="928"></A>after him, he charged the enemy's right wing, and routing it followed the 
<A NAME="929"></A>pursuit without measure or discretion, letting his eagerness and hopes 
<A NAME="930"></A>of glory tempt him on into broken ground, full of planted fruit-trees and 
<A NAME="931"></A>cut up with broad ditches, where, being engaged by Cleomenes, he fell, 
<A NAME="932"></A>fighting gallantly the noblest of battles, at the gate of his country. 
<A NAME="933"></A>The rest, flying back to their main body and troubling the ranks of the 
<A NAME="934"></A>full-armed infantry, put the whole army to the rout. Aratus was extremely 
<A NAME="935"></A>blamed, being suspected to have betrayed Lydiades, and was constrained 
<A NAME="936"></A>by the Achaeans, who withdrew in great anger, to accompany them to Aegium, 
<A NAME="937"></A>where they called a council, and decreed that he should no longer be furnished 
<A NAME="938"></A>with money, nor have any more soldiers hired for him, but that, if he would 
<A NAME="939"></A>make war, he should pay them himself.
<A NAME="940"></A><BR><BR>This affront he resented so far as to resolve to give up the seal 
<A NAME="941"></A>and lay down the office of general; but upon second thoughts he found it 
<A NAME="942"></A>best to have patience, and presently marched with the Achaeans to Orchomenus 
<A NAME="943"></A>and fought a battle with Megistonus, the stepfather of Cleomenes, where 
<A NAME="944"></A>he got the victory, killing three hundred men and taking Megistonus prisoner. 
<A NAME="945"></A>But whereas he used to be chosen general every other year, when his turn 
<A NAME="946"></A>came and he was called to take upon him that charge, he declined it, and 
<A NAME="947"></A>Timoxenus was chosen in his stead. The true cause of which was not the 
<A NAME="948"></A>pique he was alleged to have taken at the people, but the ill circumstances 
<A NAME="949"></A>of the Achaean affairs. For Cleomenes did not now invade them gently and 
<A NAME="950"></A>tenderly as hitherto, as one controlled by the civil authorities, but having 
<A NAME="951"></A>killed the Ephors, divided the lands, and made many of the stranger residents 
<A NAME="952"></A>free of the city, he was responsible to no one in his government; and therefore 
<A NAME="953"></A>fell in good earnest upon the Achaeans, and put forward his claim to the 
<A NAME="954"></A>supreme military command. Wherefore Aratus is much blamed, that in a stormy 
<A NAME="955"></A>and tempestuous time, like a cowardly pilot, he should forsake the helm 
<A NAME="956"></A>when it was even perhaps his duty to have insisted, whether they would 
<A NAME="957"></A>or no, on saving them; or if he thought the Achaean affairs desperate, 
<A NAME="958"></A>to have yielded all up to Cleomenes, and not to have let Peloponnesus fall 
<A NAME="959"></A>once again into barbarism with Macedonian garrisons, and Acro-Corinthus 
<A NAME="960"></A>be occupied with Illyric and Gaulish soldiers, and, under the specious 
<A NAME="961"></A>name of confederates, to have made those masters of the cities whom he 
<A NAME="962"></A>had held it his business by arms and by policy to baffle and defeat, and, 
<A NAME="963"></A>in the memoirs he left behind him, loaded with reproaches and insults. 
<A NAME="964"></A>And say that Cleomenes was arbitrary and tyrannical, yet was he descended 
<A NAME="965"></A>from the Heraclidae, and Sparta was his country, the obscurest citizens 
<A NAME="966"></A>of which deserved to be preferred to the generalship before the best of 
<A NAME="967"></A>the Macedonians by those that had any regard to the honour of Grecian birth. 
<A NAME="968"></A>Besides, Cleomenes sued for that command over the Achaeans as one that 
<A NAME="969"></A>would return the honour of that title with real kindnesses to the cities; 
<A NAME="970"></A>whereas Antigonus, being declared absolute general by sea and land, would 
<A NAME="971"></A>not accept the office unless Acro-Corinthus were by special agreement put 
<A NAME="972"></A>into his hands, following the example of Aesop's hunter; for he would not 
<A NAME="973"></A>get up and ride the Achaeans, who desired him so to do, and offered their 
<A NAME="974"></A>backs to him by embassies and popular decrees, till, by a garrison and 
<A NAME="975"></A>hostages, they had allowed him to bit and bridle them. Aratus exhausts 
<A NAME="976"></A>all his powers of speech to show the necessity that was upon him. But Polybius 
<A NAME="977"></A>writes, that long before this and before there was any necessity, apprehending 
<A NAME="978"></A>the daring temper of Cleomenes, he communicated secretly with Antigonus, 
<A NAME="979"></A>and that he had beforehand prevailed with the Megalopolitans to press the 
<A NAME="980"></A>Achaeans to crave aid from Antigonus. For they were the most harassed by 
<A NAME="981"></A>the war, Cleomenes continually plundering and ransacking their country. 
<A NAME="982"></A>And so writes also Phylarchus, who, unless seconded by the testimony of 
<A NAME="983"></A>Polybius, would not be altogether credited; for he is seized with enthusiasm 
<A NAME="984"></A>when he so much as speaks a word of Cleomenes, and as if he were pleading, 
<A NAME="985"></A>not writing a history, goes on throughout defending the one and accusing 
<A NAME="986"></A>the other.
<A NAME="987"></A><BR><BR>The Achaeans, therefore, lost Mantinea, which was recovered by 
<A NAME="988"></A>Cleomenes, and being beaten in a great fight near Hecatombaeum, so general 
<A NAME="989"></A>was the consternation, that they immediately sent to Cleomenes to desire 
<A NAME="990"></A>him to come to Argos and take the command upon him. But Aratus, as soon 
<A NAME="991"></A>as he understood that he was coming, and was got as far as Lerna with his 
<A NAME="992"></A>troops, fearing the result, sent ambassadors to him, to request him to 
<A NAME="993"></A>come accompanied with three hundred only, as to friends and confederates, 
<A NAME="994"></A>and, if he mistrusted anything, he should receive hostages. Upon which 
<A NAME="995"></A>Cleomenes, saying this was mere mockery and affront, went away, sending 
<A NAME="996"></A>a letter to the Achaeans full of reproaches and accusation against Aratus. 
<A NAME="997"></A>And Aratus also wrote letters against Cleomenes; and bitter revilings and 
<A NAME="998"></A>railleries were current on both hands, not sparing even their marriages 
<A NAME="999"></A>and wives. Hereupon Cleomenes sent a herald to declare war against the 
<A NAME="1000"></A>Achaeans, and in the meantime missed very narrowly of taking Sicyon by 
<A NAME="1001"></A>treachery. Turning off at a little distance, he attacked and took Pellene 
<A NAME="1002"></A>which the Achaean general abandoned, and not long after took also Pheneus 
<A NAME="1003"></A>and Penteleum. Then immediately the Argives voluntarily joined with him, 
<A NAME="1004"></A>and the Philiasians received a garrison, and in short nothing among all 
<A NAME="1005"></A>their new acquisitions held firm to the Achaeans. Aratus was encompassed 
<A NAME="1006"></A>on every side with clamour and confusion; he saw the whole of Peloponnesus 
<A NAME="1007"></A>shaking hands around him, and the cities everywhere set in revolt by men 
<A NAME="1008"></A>desirous of innovations.
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR><BR>Indeed no place remained quiet or satisfied with the present condition; 
<A NAME="1010"></A>even amongst the Sicyonians and Corinthians themselves, many were well 
<A NAME="1011"></A>known to have had private conferences with Cleomenes, who long since, out 
<A NAME="1012"></A>of desire to make themselves masters of their several cities, had been 
<A NAME="1013"></A>discontented with the present order of things. Aratus, having absolute 
<A NAME="1014"></A>power given him to bring these to consign punishment, executed as many 
<A NAME="1015"></A>of them as he could find at Sicyon, but going about to find them out and 
<A NAME="1016"></A>punish them at Corinth also, he irritated the people, already unsound in 
<A NAME="1017"></A>feeling and weary of the Achaean government. So collecting tumultuously 
<A NAME="1018"></A>in the temple of Apollo, they sent for Aratus, having determined to take 
<A NAME="1019"></A>or kill him before they broke out into open revolt. He came accordingly, 
<A NAME="1020"></A>leading his horse in his hand, as if he suspected nothing. Then several 
<A NAME="1021"></A>leaping up and accusing and reproaching him, with mild words and a settled 
<A NAME="1022"></A>countenance he bade them sit down, and not stand crying out upon him in 
<A NAME="1023"></A>a disorderly manner, desiring also, that those that were about the door 
<A NAME="1024"></A>might be let in, and saying so, he stepped out quietly, as if he would 
<A NAME="1025"></A>give his horse to somebody. Clearing himself thus of the crowd, and speaking 
<A NAME="1026"></A>without discomposure to the Corinthians that he met, commanding them to 
<A NAME="1027"></A>go to Apollo's temple, and being now, before they were aware, got near 
<A NAME="1028"></A>to the citadel, he leaped upon his horse, and commanding Cleopater, the 
<A NAME="1029"></A>governor of the garrison, to have a special care of his charge, he galloped 
<A NAME="1030"></A>to Sicyon, followed by thirty of his soldiers, the rest leaving him and 
<A NAME="1031"></A>shifting for themselves. And not long after, it being known that he was 
<A NAME="1032"></A>fled, the Corinthians pursued him, but not overtaking him, they immediately 
<A NAME="1033"></A>sent for Cleomenes and delivered up the city to him, who, however, thought 
<A NAME="1034"></A>nothing they could give was so great a gain, as was the loss of their having 
<A NAME="1035"></A>let Aratus get away. Nevertheless, being strengthened by the accession 
<A NAME="1036"></A>of the people of the Acte, as it is called, who put their towns into his 
<A NAME="1037"></A>hands, he proceeded to carry a palisade and lines of circumvallation around 
<A NAME="1038"></A>the Acro-Corinthus.
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR><BR>But Aratus being arrived at Sicyon, the body of the Achaeans there 
<A NAME="1040"></A>flocked to him, and, in an assembly there held, he was chosen general with 
<A NAME="1041"></A>absolute power, and he took about him a guard of his own citizens, it being 
<A NAME="1042"></A>now three-and-thirty years since he first took a part in public affairs 
<A NAME="1043"></A>among the Achaeans, having in that time been the chief man in credit and 
<A NAME="1044"></A>power of all Greece; but he was now deserted on all hands, helpless and 
<A NAME="1045"></A>overpowered, drifting about amidst the waves and danger on the shattered 
<A NAME="1046"></A>hulk of his native city. For the Aetolians, whom he applied to, declined 
<A NAME="1047"></A>to assist him in his distress, and the Athenians who were well affected 
<A NAME="1048"></A>to him were diverted from lending him any succour by the authority of Euclides 
<A NAME="1049"></A>and Micion. Now whereas he had a house and property in Corinth, Cleomenes 
<A NAME="1050"></A>meddled not with it, nor suffered anybody else to do so, but calling for 
<A NAME="1051"></A>his friends and agents, he bade them hold themselves responsible to Aratus 
<A NAME="1052"></A>for everything, as to him they would have to render their account; and 
<A NAME="1053"></A>privately he sent to him Tripylus, and afterwards Megistonus, his own stepfather, 
<A NAME="1054"></A>to offer him, besides several other things, a yearly pension of twelve 
<A NAME="1055"></A>talents, which was twice as much as Ptolemy allowed him, for he gave him 
<A NAME="1056"></A>six; and all that he demanded was to be declared commander of the Achaeans, 
<A NAME="1057"></A>and together with them to have the keeping of the citadel of Corinth. To 
<A NAME="1058"></A>which Aratus returning answer that affairs were not so properly in his 
<A NAME="1059"></A>power as he was in the power of them, Cleomenes, believing this a mere 
<A NAME="1060"></A>evasion, immediately entered the country of Sicyon, destroying all with 
<A NAME="1061"></A>fire and sword, and besieged the city three months, whilst Aratus held 
<A NAME="1062"></A>firm, and was in dispute with himself whether he should call in Antigonus 
<A NAME="1063"></A>upon condition of delivering up the citadel of Corinth to him; for he would 
<A NAME="1064"></A>not lend him assistance upon any other terms.
<A NAME="1065"></A><BR><BR>In the meantime the Achaeans assembled at Aegium, and called for 
<A NAME="1066"></A>Aratus; but it was very hazardous for him to pass thither, while Cleomenes 
<A NAME="1067"></A>was encamped before Sicyon; besides, the citizens endeavoured to stop him 
<A NAME="1068"></A>by their entreaties, protesting that they would not suffer him to expose 
<A NAME="1069"></A>himself to so evident danger, the enemy being so near; the women, also, 
<A NAME="1070"></A>and children hung about him, weeping and embracing him as their common 
<A NAME="1071"></A>father and defender. But he, having comforted and encouraged them as well 
<A NAME="1072"></A>as he could, got on horseback, and being accompanied with ten of his friends 
<A NAME="1073"></A>and his son, then a youth, got away to the seaside, and finding vessels 
<A NAME="1074"></A>there waiting off the shore, went on board of them and sailed to Aegium 
<A NAME="1075"></A>to the assembly; in which it was decreed that Antigonus should be called 
<A NAME="1076"></A>in to their aid, and should have the Acro-Corinthus delivered to him. Aratus 
<A NAME="1077"></A>also sent his son to him with the other hostages. The Corinthians, extremely 
<A NAME="1078"></A>angry at this proceeding, now plundered his property, and gave his house 
<A NAME="1079"></A>as a present to Cleomenes.
<A NAME="1080"></A><BR><BR>Antigonus being now near at hand with his army, consisting of twenty 
<A NAME="1081"></A>thousand Macedonian foot and one thousand three hundred horse, Aratus, 
<A NAME="1082"></A>with the members of council, went to meet him by sea, and got, unobserved 
<A NAME="1083"></A>by the enemy, to Pegae, having no great confidence either in
