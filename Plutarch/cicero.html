<A NAME="2"></A>
<BR>(died 43 B.C.E.)
<BR><BR>By Plutarch
<A NAME="3"></A><BR><BR>Written 75 A.C.E.
<BR><BR>Translated by John Dryden</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>IT is generally said, that Helvia, the mother of Cicero, was both well-born 
<A NAME="11"></A>and lived a fair life; but of his father nothing is reported but in extremes. 
<A NAME="12"></A>For whilst some would have him the son of a fuller, and educated in that 
<A NAME="13"></A>trade, others carry back the origin of his family to Tullus Attius, an 
<A NAME="14"></A>illustrious king of the Volscians, who waged war not without honour against 
<A NAME="15"></A>the Romans. However, he who first of that house was surnamed Cicero seems 
<A NAME="16"></A>to have been a person worthy to be remembered; since those who succeeded 
<A NAME="17"></A>him not only did not reject, but were fond of that name, though vulgarly 
<A NAME="18"></A>made a matter of reproach. For the Latins call a vetch Cicer, and a nick 
<A NAME="19"></A>or dent at the tip of his nose, which resembled the opening in a vetch, 
<A NAME="20"></A>gave him the surname of Cicero.
<A NAME="21"></A><BR><BR>Cicero, whose story I am writing, is said to have replied with 
<A NAME="22"></A>spirit to some of his friends, who recommended him to lay aside or change 
<A NAME="23"></A>the name when he first stood for office and engaged in politics, that he 
<A NAME="24"></A>would make it his endeavour to render the name of Cicero more glorious 
<A NAME="25"></A>than that of the Scauri and Catuli. And when he was quaestor in Sicily, 
<A NAME="26"></A>and was making an offering of silver plate to the gods, and had inscribed 
<A NAME="27"></A>his two names, Marcus and Tullius, instead of the third, he jestingly told 
<A NAME="28"></A>the artificer to engrave the figure of a vetch by them. Thus much is told 
<A NAME="29"></A>us about his name.
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>Of his birth it is reported that his mother was delivered, without 
<A NAME="31"></A>pain or labour, on the third of the new Calends, the same day on which 
<A NAME="32"></A>now the magistrates of Rome pray and sacrifice for the emperor. It is said 
<A NAME="33"></A>also, that a vision appeared to his nurse, and foretold the child she then 
<A NAME="34"></A>suckled should afterwards become a great benefit to the Roman states. To 
<A NAME="35"></A>such presages, which might in general be thought mere fancies and idle 
<A NAME="36"></A>talk, he himself ere long gave the credit of true prophecies. For as soon 
<A NAME="37"></A>as he was of an age to begin to have lessons, he became so distinguished 
<A NAME="38"></A>for his talent, and got such a name and reputation among the boys, that 
<A NAME="39"></A>their fathers would often visit the school that they might see young Cicero, 
<A NAME="40"></A>and might be able to say that they themselves had witnessed the quickness 
<A NAME="41"></A>and readiness in learning for which he was renowned. And the more rude 
<A NAME="42"></A>among them used to be angry with their children, to see them, as they walked 
<A NAME="43"></A>together, receiving Cicero with respect into the middle place. And being, 
<A NAME="44"></A>as Plato would have the scholar-like and philosophical temper, eager for 
<A NAME="45"></A>every kind of learning, and indisposed to no description of knowledge or 
<A NAME="46"></A>instruction, he showed, however, a more peculiar propensity to poetry; 
<A NAME="47"></A>and there is a poem now extant made by him when a boy, in tetrameter verse, 
<A NAME="48"></A>called Pontius Glaucus. And afterwards, when he applied himself more curiously 
<A NAME="49"></A>to these accomplishments, he had the name of being not only the best orator, 
<A NAME="50"></A>but also the best poet of Rome. And the glory of his rhetoric still remains, 
<A NAME="51"></A>notwithstanding the many new modes in speaking since his time; but his 
<A NAME="52"></A>verses are forgotten and out of all repute, so many ingenious poets have 
<A NAME="53"></A>followed him.
<A NAME="54"></A><BR><BR>Leaving his juvenile studies, he became an auditor of Philo the 
<A NAME="55"></A>Academic, whom the Romans, above all the other scholars of Clitomachus, 
<A NAME="56"></A>admired for his eloquence and loved for his character. He also sought the 
<A NAME="57"></A>company of the Mucii, who were eminent statesmen and leaders in the senate, 
<A NAME="58"></A>and acquired from them a knowledge of the laws. For some short time he 
<A NAME="59"></A>served in arms under Sylla, in the Marsian war. But perceiving the commonwealth 
<A NAME="60"></A>running into factions, and from faction all things tending to an absolute 
<A NAME="61"></A>monarchy, he betook himself to a retired and contemplative life, and conversing 
<A NAME="62"></A>with the learned Greeks, devoted himself to study, till Sylla had obtained 
<A NAME="63"></A>the government, and the commonwealth was in some kind of 
<A NAME="64"></A>settlement.
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR>At this time, Chrysogonus, Sylla's emancipated slave, having laid 
<A NAME="66"></A>an information about an estate belonging to one who was said to have been 
<A NAME="67"></A>put to death by proscription, had bought it himself for two thousand drachmas. 
<A NAME="68"></A>And when Roscius, the son and heir of the dead, complained, and demonstrated 
<A NAME="69"></A>the estate to be worth two hundred and fifty talents, Sylla took it angrily 
<A NAME="70"></A>to have his actions questioned, and preferred a process against Roscius 
<A NAME="71"></A>for the of his father, Chrysogonus managing the evidence. None of the advocates 
<A NAME="72"></A>durst assist him, but, fearing the cruelty of Sylla, avoided the cause. 
<A NAME="73"></A>The young man, being thus deserted, came for refuge to Cicero. Cicero's 
<A NAME="74"></A>friends encouraged him, saying he was not likely ever to have a fairer 
<A NAME="75"></A>and more honourable introduction to public life; he therefore undertook 
<A NAME="76"></A>the defence, carried the cause, and got much renown for 
<A NAME="77"></A>it.
<A NAME="78"></A><BR><BR>But fearing Sylla, he travelled into Greece, and gave it out that 
<A NAME="79"></A>he did so for the benefit of his health. And indeed he was lean and meagre, 
<A NAME="80"></A>and had such a weakness in his stomach that he could take nothing but a 
<A NAME="81"></A>spare and thin diet, and that not till late in the evening. His voice was 
<A NAME="82"></A>loud and good, but so harsh and unmanaged that in vehemence and heat of 
<A NAME="83"></A>speaking he always raised it to so high a tone that there seemed to be 
<A NAME="84"></A>reason to fear about his health.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>When he came to Athens he was a hearer of Antiochus of Ascalon, 
<A NAME="86"></A>with whose fluency and elegance of diction he was much taken, although 
<A NAME="87"></A>he did not approve of his innovations in doctrine. For Antiochus had now 
<A NAME="88"></A>fallen off from the New Academy, as they call it, and forsaken the sect 
<A NAME="89"></A>of Carneades, whether that he was moved by the argument of manifestness 
<A NAME="90"></A>and the senses, or, as some say, had been led by feelings of rivalry and 
<A NAME="91"></A>opposition to the followers of Clitomachus and Philo to change his opinions, 
<A NAME="92"></A>and in most things to embrace the doctrine of the Stoics. But Cicero rather 
<A NAME="93"></A>affected and adhered to the doctrines of the New Academy; and purposed 
<A NAME="94"></A>with himself, if he should be disappointed of any employment in the commonwealth, 
<A NAME="95"></A>to retire hither from pleading and political affairs, and to pass his life 
<A NAME="96"></A>with quiet in the study of philosophy.
<A NAME="97"></A><BR><BR>But after he had received the news of Sylla's death, and his body, 
<A NAME="98"></A>strengthened again by exercise, was come to a vigorous habit, his voice 
<A NAME="99"></A>managed and rendered sweet and full to the ear and pretty well brought 
<A NAME="100"></A>into keeping with his general constitution, his friends at Rome earnestly 
<A NAME="101"></A>soliciting him by letters, and Antiochus also urging him to return to public 
<A NAME="102"></A>affairs, he again prepared for use his orator's instrument of rhetoric, 
<A NAME="103"></A>and summoned into action his political faculties, diligently exercising 
<A NAME="104"></A>himself in declamations and attending the most celebrated rhetoricians 
<A NAME="105"></A>of the time. He sailed from Athens for Asia and Rhodes. Amongst the Asian 
<A NAME="106"></A>masters, he conversed with Xenocles of Adramyttium, Dionysius of Magnesia, 
<A NAME="107"></A>and Menippus of Caria; at Rhodes, he studied oratory with Apollonius, the 
<A NAME="108"></A>son of Molon, and philosophy with Posidonius. Apollonius, we are told, 
<A NAME="109"></A>not understanding Latin, requested Cicero to declaim in Greek. He complied 
<A NAME="110"></A>willingly, thinking that his faults would thus be better pointed out to 
<A NAME="111"></A>him. And after he finished, all his other hearers were astonished, and 
<A NAME="112"></A>contended who should praise him most, but Apollonius, who had shown no 
<A NAME="113"></A>signs of excitement whilst he was hearing him, so also now, when it was 
<A NAME="114"></A>over, sate musing for some considerable time, without any remark. And when 
<A NAME="115"></A>Cicero was discomposed at this, he said, "You have my praise and admiration, 
<A NAME="116"></A>Cicero, and Greece my pity and commiseration, since those arts and that 
<A NAME="117"></A>eloquence which are the only glories that remain to her, will now be transferred 
<A NAME="118"></A>by you to Rome."
<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR>And now when Cicero, full of expectation, was again bent upon political 
<A NAME="120"></A>affairs, a certain oracle blunted the edge of his inclination for consulting 
<A NAME="121"></A>the god of Delphi how he should attain most glory, the Pythoness answered, 
<A NAME="122"></A>by making his own genius and not the opinion of the people the guide of 
<A NAME="123"></A>his life; and therefore at first he passed his time in Rome cautiously, 
<A NAME="124"></A>and was very backward in pretending to public offices, so that he was at 
<A NAME="125"></A>that time in little esteem, and had got the names, so readily given by 
<A NAME="126"></A>low and ignorant people in Rome, of Greek and Scholar. But when his own 
<A NAME="127"></A>desire of fame and the eagerness of his father and relations had made him 
<A NAME="128"></A>take in earnest to pleading, he made no slow or gentle advance to the first 
<A NAME="129"></A>place, but shone out in full lustre at once, and far surpassed all the 
<A NAME="130"></A>advocates of the bar. At first, it is said, he, as well as Demosthenes, 
<A NAME="131"></A>was defective in his delivery, and on that account paid much attention 
<A NAME="132"></A>to the instructions sometimes of Roscius the comedian, and sometimes of 
<A NAME="133"></A>Aesop the tragedian. They tell of this Aesop, that whilst he was representing 
<A NAME="134"></A>on the theatre Atreus deliberating the revenge of Thyestes, he was so transported 
<A NAME="135"></A>beyond himself in the beat of action, that he struck with his sceptre one 
<A NAME="136"></A>of the servants, who was running across the stage, so violently that he 
<A NAME="137"></A>laid him dead upon the place. And such afterwards was Cicero's delivery 
<A NAME="138"></A>that it did not a little contribute to render his eloquence persuasive. 
<A NAME="139"></A>He used to ridicule loud speakers, saying that they shouted because they 
<A NAME="140"></A>could not speak, like lame men who get on horseback because they cannot 
<A NAME="141"></A>walk. And his readiness and address in sarcasm, and generally in witty 
<A NAME="142"></A>sayings, was thought to suit a pleader very well, and to be highly attractive, 
<A NAME="143"></A>but his using it to excess offended many, and gave him the repute of 
<A NAME="144"></A>ill-nature.
<A NAME="145"></A><BR><BR>He was appointed quaestor in a great scarcity of corn and had Sicily 
<A NAME="146"></A>for his province, where though at first he displeased many, by compelling 
<A NAME="147"></A>them to send in their provisions to Rome, yet after they had had experience 
<A NAME="148"></A>of his care, justice, and clemency, they honoured him more than ever they 
<A NAME="149"></A>did any of their governors before. It happened, also, that some young Romans 
<A NAME="150"></A>of good and noble families, charged with neglect of discipline and misconduct 
<A NAME="151"></A>in military service, were brought before the praetor in Sicily. Cicero 
<A NAME="152"></A>undertook their defence, which he conducted admirably, and got them acquitted. 
<A NAME="153"></A>So returning to Rome with a great opinion of himself for these things, 
<A NAME="154"></A>a ludicrous incident befell him, as he tells us himself. Meeting an eminent 
<A NAME="155"></A>citizen in Campania, whom he accounted his friend, he asked him what the 
<A NAME="156"></A>Romans said and thought of his actions, as if the whole city had been filled 
<A NAME="157"></A>with the glory of what he had done. His friend asked him in reply, "Where 
<A NAME="158"></A>is it you have been, Cicero?" This for the time utterly mortified and cast 
<A NAME="159"></A>him down to perceive that the report of his actions had sunk into the city 
<A NAME="160"></A>of Rome as into an immense ocean, without any visible effect or result 
<A NAME="161"></A>in reputation. And afterwards considering with himself that the glory he 
<A NAME="162"></A>contended for was an infinite thing, and that there was no fixed end nor 
<A NAME="163"></A>measure in its pursuit, he abated much of his ambitious thoughts. Nevertheless, 
<A NAME="164"></A>he was always excessively pleased with his own praise, and continued to 
<A NAME="165"></A>the very last to be passionately fond of glory; which often interfered 
<A NAME="166"></A>with the prosecution of his wisest resolutions.
<A NAME="167"></A><BR><BR>On beginning to apply himself more resolutely to public business, 
<A NAME="168"></A>he remarked it as an and absurd thing that artificers, using vessels and 
<A NAME="169"></A>instruments inanimate, should know the name, place, and use of every one 
<A NAME="170"></A>of them, and yet the statesman, whose instruments for carrying out public 
<A NAME="171"></A>measures are men, should be negligent and careless in the knowledge of 
<A NAME="172"></A>persons. And so be not only acquainted himself with the names, but also 
<A NAME="173"></A>knew the particular place where every one of the more eminent citizens 
<A NAME="174"></A>dwelt, what lands he possessed, the friends he made use of, and those that 
<A NAME="175"></A>were of his neighbourhood, and when he travelled on any road in Italy, 
<A NAME="176"></A>he could readily name and show the estates and seats of his friends and 
<A NAME="177"></A>acquaintance. Having so small an estate, though a sufficient competency 
<A NAME="178"></A>for his own expenses, it was much wondered at that he took neither fees 
<A NAME="179"></A>nor gifts from his clients, and more especially that he did not do so when 
<A NAME="180"></A>he undertook the prosecution of Verres. This Verres, who had been praetor 
<A NAME="181"></A>of Sicily, and stood charged by the Sicilians of many evil practices during 
<A NAME="182"></A>his government there, Cicero succeeded in getting condemned, not by speaking, 
<A NAME="183"></A>but in a manner by holding his tongue. For the praetors, favouring Verres, 
<A NAME="184"></A>had deferred the trial by several adjournments to the last day, in which 
<A NAME="185"></A>it was evident there could not be sufficient time for the advocates to 
<A NAME="186"></A>be heard, and the cause brought to an issue. Cicero, therefore, came forward, 
<A NAME="187"></A>and said there was no need of speeches; and after producing and examining 
<A NAME="188"></A>witnesses, he required the judges to proceed to sentence. However, many 
<A NAME="189"></A>witty sayings are on record, as having been used by Cicero on the occasion. 
<A NAME="190"></A>When a man named Caecilius, one of the freed slaves, who was said to be 
<A NAME="191"></A>given to Jewish practices, would have put by the Sicilians, and undertaken 
<A NAME="192"></A>the prosecution of Verres himself, Cicero asked, "What has a Jew to do 
<A NAME="193"></A>with swine?" verres being the Roman word for a boar. And when Verres began 
<A NAME="194"></A>to reproach Cicero with effeminate living, "You ought," replied he, "to 
<A NAME="195"></A>use this language at home, to your sons;" Verres having a son who had fallen 
<A NAME="196"></A>into disgraceful courses. Hortensius the orator, not daring directly to 
<A NAME="197"></A>undertake the defence of Verres, was yet persuaded to appear for him at 
<A NAME="198"></A>the laying on of the fine, and received an ivory sphinx for his reward; 
<A NAME="199"></A>and when Cicero in some passage of the speech, obliquely reflected on him, 
<A NAME="200"></A>and Hortensius told him he was not skilful in solving riddles, "No," said 
<A NAME="201"></A>Cicero, "and yet you have the sphinx in your house!"
<A NAME="202"></A><BR><BR>Verres was thus convicted; though Cicero, who set the fine at seventy-five 
<A NAME="203"></A>myriads, lay under the suspicion of being corrupted by bribery to lessen 
<A NAME="204"></A>the sum. But the Sicilians, in testimony of their gratitude, came and brought 
<A NAME="205"></A>him all sorts of presents from the island, when he was aedile; of which 
<A NAME="206"></A>he made no private profit himself, but used their generosity only to reduce 
<A NAME="207"></A>the public price of provisions.
<A NAME="208"></A><BR><BR>He had a very pleasant seat at Arpi, he had also a farm near Naples, 
<A NAME="209"></A>and another about Pompeii, but neither of any great value. The portion 
<A NAME="210"></A>of his wife, Terentia, amounted to ten myriads, and he had a bequest valued 
<A NAME="211"></A>at nine myriads of denarii; upon these he lived in a liberal but temperate 
<A NAME="212"></A>style with the learned Greeks and Romans that were his familiars. He rarely, 
<A NAME="213"></A>if at any time, sat down to meat till sunset, and that not so much on account 
<A NAME="214"></A>of business, as for his health and the weakness of his stomach. He was 
<A NAME="215"></A>otherwise in the care of his body nice and delicate, appointing himself, 
<A NAME="216"></A>for example, a set number of walks and rubbings. And after this manner 
<A NAME="217"></A>managing the habit of his body, he brought it in time to be healthful, 
<A NAME="218"></A>and capable of supporting many great fatigues and trials. His father's 
<A NAME="219"></A>house he made over to his brother, living himself near the Palatine hill, 
<A NAME="220"></A>that he might not give the trouble of long journeys to those that made 
<A NAME="221"></A>suit to him. And, indeed, there were not fewer daily appearing at his door, 
<A NAME="222"></A>to do their court to him, than there were that came to Crassus for his 
<A NAME="223"></A>riches, or to Pompey for his power amongst the soldiers, these being at 
<A NAME="224"></A>that time the two men of the greatest repute and influence in Rome. Nay, 
<A NAME="225"></A>even Pompey himself used to pay court to Cicero, and Cicero's public actions 
<A NAME="226"></A>did much to establish Pompey's authority and reputation in the 
<A NAME="227"></A>state.
<A NAME="228"></A><BR><BR>Numerous distinguished competitors stood with him for the praetor's 
<A NAME="229"></A>office; but he was chosen before them all, and managed the decision of 
<A NAME="230"></A>causes with justice and integrity. It is related that Licinius Macer, a 
<A NAME="231"></A>man himself of great power in the city, and supported also by the assistance 
<A NAME="232"></A>of Crassus, was accused before him of extortion, and that, in confidence 
<A NAME="233"></A>on his own interest and the diligence of his friends, whilst the judges 
<A NAME="234"></A>were debating about the sentence, he went to his house, where hastily trimming 
<A NAME="235"></A>his hair and putting on a clean gown as already acquitted, he was setting 
<A NAME="236"></A>off again to go to the Forum; but at his hall door meeting Crassus, who 
<A NAME="237"></A>told him that he was condemned by all the votes, he went in again, threw 
<A NAME="238"></A>himself upon his bed, and died immediately. This verdict was considered 
<A NAME="239"></A>very creditable to Cicero, as showing his careful management of the courts 
<A NAME="240"></A>of justice. On another occasion, Vatinius, a man of rude manners and often 
<A NAME="241"></A>insolent in court to the magistrates, who had large swellings on his neck, 
<A NAME="242"></A>came before his tribunal and made some request, and on Cicero's desiring 
<A NAME="243"></A>further time to consider it, told him that he himself would have made no 
<A NAME="244"></A>question about it had he been praetor. Cicero, turning quickly upon him, 
<A NAME="245"></A>answered, "But I, you see, have not the neck that you 
<A NAME="246"></A>have."
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR>When there were but two or three days remaining in his office, 
<A NAME="248"></A>Manilius was brought before him, and charged with peculation. Manilius 
<A NAME="249"></A>had the good opinion and favour of the common people, and was thought to 
<A NAME="250"></A>be prosecuted only for Pompey's sake, whose particular friend he was. And 
<A NAME="251"></A>therefore, when he asked a space of time before his trial, and Cicero allowed 
<A NAME="252"></A>him but one day, and that the next only, the common people grew highly 
<A NAME="253"></A>offended, because it had been the custom of the praetors to allow ten days 
<A NAME="254"></A>at least to the accused; and the tribunes of the people, having called 
<A NAME="255"></A>him before the people and accused him, he, desiring to be heard, said, 
<A NAME="256"></A>that as he had always treated the accused with equity and humanity, as 
<A NAME="257"></A>far as the law allowed, so he thought it hard to deny the same to Manilius, 
<A NAME="258"></A>and that he had studiously appointed that day of which alone, as praetor, 
<A NAME="259"></A>he was master, and that it was not the part of those that were desirous 
<A NAME="260"></A>to help him to cast the judgment of his cause upon another praetor. These 
<A NAME="261"></A>things being said made a wonderful change in the people, and commending 
<A NAME="262"></A>him much for it they desired that he himself would undertake the defence 
<A NAME="263"></A>of Manilius; which he willingly consented to, and that principally for 
<A NAME="264"></A>the sake of Pompey, who was absent. And, accordingly, taking his place 
<A NAME="265"></A>before the people again, he delivered a bold invective upon the oligarchical 
<A NAME="266"></A>party and on those who were jealous of Pompey.
<A NAME="267"></A><BR><BR>Yet he was preferred to the consulship no less by the nobles than 
<A NAME="268"></A>the common people, for the good of the city; and both parties jointly assisted 
<A NAME="269"></A>his promotion, upon the following reasons. The change of government made 
<A NAME="270"></A>by Sylla, which at first seemed a senseless one by time and usage had now 
<A NAME="271"></A>come to be considered by the people no unsatisfactory settlement. But there 
<A NAME="272"></A>were some that endeavoured to alter and subvert the whole present state 
<A NAME="273"></A>of affairs, not from any good motives, but for their own private gain; 
<A NAME="274"></A>and Pompey being at this time employed in the wars with the kings of Pontus 
<A NAME="275"></A>and Armenia, there was no sufficient force at Rome to suppress any attempts 
<A NAME="276"></A>at a revolution. These people had for their head a man of bold, daring, 
<A NAME="277"></A>and restless character, Lucius Catiline, who was accused, besides other 
<A NAME="278"></A>great offences, of deflowering his virgin daughter, and killing his own 
<A NAME="279"></A>brother; for which latter crime, fearing to be prosecuted at law, he persuaded 
<A NAME="280"></A>Sylla to set him down, as though he were yet alive, amongst those that 
<A NAME="281"></A>were to be put to death by proscription. This man the profligate citizens 
<A NAME="282"></A>choosing for their captain, gave faith to one another, amongst other pledges, 
<A NAME="283"></A>by sacrificing a man, and eating of his flesh; and a great part of the 
<A NAME="284"></A>young men of the city were corrupted by him, he providing for every one 
<A NAME="285"></A>pleasures, drink, and women, and profusely supplying the expense of these 
<A NAME="286"></A>debauches. Etruria, moreover, had all been excited to revolt, as well as 
<A NAME="287"></A>a great part of Gaul within the Alps. But Rome itself was in the most dangerous 
<A NAME="288"></A>inclination to change on account of the unequal distribution of wealth 
<A NAME="289"></A>and property, those of highest rank and greatest spirit having impoverished 
<A NAME="290"></A>themselves by shows, entertainments, ambition of offices, and sumptuous 
<A NAME="291"></A>buildings, and the riches of the city having thus fallen into the hands 
<A NAME="292"></A>of mean and low-born persons. So that there wanted but a slight impetus 
<A NAME="293"></A>to set all in motion, it being in the power of every daring man to overturn 
<A NAME="294"></A>a sickly commonwealth.
<A NAME="295"></A><BR><BR>Catiline, however, being desirous of procuring a strong position 
<A NAME="296"></A>to carry out his designs, stood for the consulship, and had great hopes 
<A NAME="297"></A>of success, thinking he should be appointed with Caius Antonius as his 
<A NAME="298"></A>colleague, who was a man fit to lead neither in a good cause nor in a bad 
<A NAME="299"></A>one, but might be a valuable accession to another's power. These things 
<A NAME="300"></A>the greatest part of the good and honest citizens apprehending, put Cicero 
<A NAME="301"></A>upon standing for the consulship; whom the people readily receiving Catiline 
<A NAME="302"></A>was put by, so that he and Caius Antonius were chosen, although amongst 
<A NAME="303"></A>the competitors he was the only man descended from a father of the equestrian 
<A NAME="304"></A>and not of the senatorial order.
<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR>Though the designs of Catiline were not yet publicly known, yet 
<A NAME="306"></A>considerable preliminary troubles immediately followed upon Cicero's entrance 
<A NAME="307"></A>upon the consulship. For, on the one side, those who were disqualified 
<A NAME="308"></A>by the laws of Sylla from holding any public offices, being neither inconsiderable 
<A NAME="309"></A>in power nor in number, came forward as candidates and caressed the people 
<A NAME="310"></A>for them; speaking many things truly and justly against the tyranny of 
<A NAME="311"></A>Sylla, only that they disturbed the government at an improper and unseasonable 
<A NAME="312"></A>time; on the other hand, the tribunes of the people proposed laws to the 
<A NAME="313"></A>same purpose, constituting a commission of ten persons, with unlimited 
<A NAME="314"></A>powers, in whom as supreme governors should be vested the right of selling 
<A NAME="315"></A>the public lands of all Italy and Syria and Pompey's new conquest, of judging 
<A NAME="316"></A>and banishing whom they pleased, of planting colonies, of taking moneys 
<A NAME="317"></A>out of the treasury, and of levying and paying what soldiers should be 
<A NAME="318"></A>thought needful. And several of the nobility favoured this law, but especially 
<A NAME="319"></A>Caius Antonius, Cicero's colleague, in hopes of being one of the ten. But 
<A NAME="320"></A>what gave the greatest fear to the nobles was, that he was thought privy 
<A NAME="321"></A>to the conspiracy of Catiline, and not to dislike it because of his great 
<A NAME="322"></A>debts.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR><BR>Cicero, endeavouring in the first place to provide a remedy against 
<A NAME="324"></A>this danger, procured a decree assigning to him the province of Macedonia, 
<A NAME="325"></A>he himself declining that of Gaul, which was offered to him. And this piece 
<A NAME="326"></A>of favour so completely won over Antonius, that he was ready to second 
<A NAME="327"></A>and respond to, like a hired player, whatever Cicero said for the good 
<A NAME="328"></A>of the country. And now, having made his colleague thus tame and tractable, 
<A NAME="329"></A>he could with greater courage attack the conspirators. And, therefore, 
<A NAME="330"></A>in the senate, making an oration against the law of the ten commissioners, 
<A NAME="331"></A>he so confounded those who proposed it, that they had nothing to reply. 
<A NAME="332"></A>And when they again endeavoured, and, having prepared things beforehand, 
<A NAME="333"></A>had called the consuls before the assembly of the people, Cicero, fearing 
<A NAME="334"></A>nothing, went first out, and commanded the senate to follow him, and not 
<A NAME="335"></A>only succeeded in throwing out the law, but so entirely overpowered the 
<A NAME="336"></A>tribunes by his oratory, that they abandoned all thought of their other 
<A NAME="337"></A>projects.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR>For Cicero, it may be said, was the one man, above all others who 
<A NAME="339"></A>made the Romans feel how great a charm eloquence lends to what is good, 
<A NAME="340"></A>and how invincible justice is, if it be well spoken; and that it is necessary 
<A NAME="341"></A>for him who would dexterously govern a commonwealth, in action, always 
<A NAME="342"></A>to prefer that which is honest before that which is popular, and in speaking, 
<A NAME="343"></A>to free the right and useful measure from everything that may occasion 
<A NAME="344"></A>offence. An incident occurred in the theatre, during his consulship, which 
<A NAME="345"></A>showed what his speaking could do. For whereas formerly the knights of 
<A NAME="346"></A>Rome were mingled in the theatre with the common people, and took their 
<A NAME="347"></A>places among them as it happened, Marcus Otho, when he was praetor, was 
<A NAME="348"></A>the first who distinguished them from the other citizens and appointed 
<A NAME="349"></A>them a proper seat, which they still enjoy as their special place in the 
<A NAME="350"></A>theatre. This the common people took as an indignity done to them, and, 
<A NAME="351"></A>therefore, when Otho appeared in the theatre they hissed him; the knights, 
<A NAME="352"></A>on the contrary, received him with loud clapping. The people repeated and 
<A NAME="353"></A>increased their hissing; the knights continued their clapping. Upon this, 
<A NAME="354"></A>turning upon one another, they broke out into insulting words, so that 
<A NAME="355"></A>the theatre was in great disorder. Cicero being informed of it, came himself 
<A NAME="356"></A>to the theatre, and summoning the people into the temple of Bellona, he 
<A NAME="357"></A>so effectually chid and chastised them for it, that again returning into 
<A NAME="358"></A>the theatre they received Otho with loud applause, contending with the 
<A NAME="359"></A>knights who should give him the greatest demonstrations of honour and 
<A NAME="360"></A>respect.
<A NAME="361"></A><BR><BR>The conspirators with Catiline, at first cowed and disheartened, 
<A NAME="362"></A>began presently to take courage again. And assembling themselves together, 
<A NAME="363"></A>they exhorted one another boldly to undertake the design before Pompey's 
<A NAME="364"></A>return, who, as it was said, was now on his march with his forces for Rome. 
<A NAME="365"></A>But the old soldiers of Sylla were Catiline's chief stimulus to action. 
<A NAME="366"></A>They had been disbanded all about Italy, but the greatest number and the 
<A NAME="367"></A>fiercest of them lay scattered among the cities of Etruria entertaining 
<A NAME="368"></A>themselves with dreams of new plunder and rapine amongst the hoarded riches 
<A NAME="369"></A>of Italy. These, having for their leader Manlius, who had served with distinction 
<A NAME="370"></A>in the wars under Sylla, joined themselves to Catiline, and came to Rome 
<A NAME="371"></A>to assist him with their suffrages at the election. For he again pretended 
<A NAME="372"></A>to the consulship, having resolved to kill Cicero in a tumult at the elections. 
<A NAME="373"></A>Also, the divine powers seemed to give intimation of the coming troubles, 
<A NAME="374"></A>by earthquakes, thunderbolts, and strange appearances. Nor was human evidence 
<A NAME="375"></A>wanting certain enough in itself, though not sufficient for the conviction 
<A NAME="376"></A>of the noble and powerful Catiline. Therefore Cicero, deferring the day 
<A NAME="377"></A>of election, summoned Catiline into the senate, and questioned him as to 
<A NAME="378"></A>the charges made against him. Catiline, believing there were many in the 
<A NAME="379"></A>senate desirous of change, and to give a specimen of himself to the conspirators 
<A NAME="380"></A>present, returned an audacious answer, "What harm," said he, "when I see 
<A NAME="381"></A>two bodies, the one lean and consumptive with a head, the other great and 
<A NAME="382"></A>strong without one, if I put a head to that body which wants one?" This 
<A NAME="383"></A>covert representation of the senate and the people excited yet greater 
<A NAME="384"></A>apprehensions in Cicero. He put on armour, and was attended from his house 
<A NAME="385"></A>by the noble citizens in a body; and a number of the young men went with 
<A NAME="386"></A>him into the Plain. Here designedly letting his tunic slip partly off from 
<A NAME="387"></A>his shoulders, he showed his armour underneath, and discovered his danger 
<A NAME="388"></A>to the spectators; who, being much moved at it, gathered round about him 
<A NAME="389"></A>for his defence. At length, Catiline was by a general suffrage again put 
<A NAME="390"></A>by, and Silanus and Murena chosen consuls.
<A NAME="391"></A><BR><BR>Not long after this, Catiline's soldiers got together in a body 
<A NAME="392"></A>in Etruria, and began to form themselves into companies, the day appointed 
<A NAME="393"></A>for the design being near at hand. About midnight, some of the principal 
<A NAME="394"></A>and most powerful citizens of Rome, Marcus Crassus, Marcus Marcellus, and 
<A NAME="395"></A>Scipio Metellus went to Cicero's house, where, knocking at the gate, and 
<A NAME="396"></A>calling up the porter, they commanded him to awake Cicero, and tell him 
<A NAME="397"></A>they were there. The business was this: Crassus's porter after supper had 
<A NAME="398"></A>delivered to him letters brought by an unknown person. Some of them were 
<A NAME="399"></A>directed to others, but one to Crassus, without a name; this only Crassus 
<A NAME="400"></A>read, which informed him that there was a great slaughter intended by Catiline, 
<A NAME="401"></A>and advised him to leave the city. The others he did not open, but went 
<A NAME="402"></A>with them immediately to Cicero, being affrighted at the danger, and to 
<A NAME="403"></A>free himself of the suspicion he lay under for his familiarity with Catiline. 
<A NAME="404"></A>Cicero, considering the matter, summoned the senate at break of day. The 
<A NAME="405"></A>letters he brought with him, and delivered them to those to whom they were 
<A NAME="406"></A>directed, commanding them to read them publicly; they all alike contained 
<A NAME="407"></A>an account of the conspiracy. And when Quintus Arrius a man of praetorian 
<A NAME="408"></A>dignity, recounted to them how soldiers were collecting in companies in 
<A NAME="409"></A>Etruria, and Manlius stated to be in motion with a large force, hovering 
<A NAME="410"></A>about those cities, in expectation of intelligence from Rome, the senate 
<A NAME="411"></A>made a decree to place all in the hands of the consuls, who should undertake 
<A NAME="412"></A>the conduct of everything, and do their best to save the state. This was 
<A NAME="413"></A>not a common thing, but only done by the senate in case of imminent 
<A NAME="414"></A>danger.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR><BR>After Cicero had received this power, he committed all affairs 
<A NAME="416"></A>outside to Quintus Metellus, but the management of the city he kept in 
<A NAME="417"></A>his own hands. Such a numerous attendance guarded him every day when he 
<A NAME="418"></A>went abroad, that the greatest part of the market-place was filled with 
<A NAME="419"></A>his train when he entered it. Catiline, impatient of further delay, resolved 
<A NAME="420"></A>himself to break forth and go to Manlius, but he commanded Marcius and 
<A NAME="421"></A>Cethegus to take their swords, and go early in the morning to Cicero's 
<A NAME="422"></A>gates, as if only intending to salute him, and then to fall upon him and 
<A NAME="423"></A>slay him. This a noble lady, Fulvia, coming by night, discovered to Cicero, 
<A NAME="424"></A>bidding him beware of Cethegus and Marcius. They came by break of day and 
<A NAME="425"></A>being denied entrance, made an outcry and disturbance at the gates, which 
<A NAME="426"></A>excited all the more suspicion. But Cicero, going forth, summoned the senate 
<A NAME="427"></A>into the temple of Jupiter Stator, which stands at the end of the Sacred 
<A NAME="428"></A>Street, going up to the Palatine. And when Catiline with others of his 
<A NAME="429"></A>party also came, as intending to make his defence, none of the senators 
<A NAME="430"></A>would sit by him, but all of them left the bench where he had placed himself. 
<A NAME="431"></A>And when he began to speak, they interrupted him with outcries. At length 
<A NAME="432"></A>Cicero, standing up, commanded him to leave the city, for since one governed 
<A NAME="433"></A>the commonwealth with words, the other with arms, it was necessary there 
<A NAME="434"></A>should be a wall betwixt them. Catiline, therefore, immediately left the 
<A NAME="435"></A>town, with three hundred armed men; and assuming, as if he had been a magistrate, 
<A NAME="436"></A>the rods, axes, and military ensigns, he went to Manlius, and having got 
<A NAME="437"></A>together a body of near twenty thousand men, with these he marched to the 
<A NAME="438"></A>several cities, endeavouring to persuade or force them to revolt. So it 
<A NAME="439"></A>being now come to open war, Antonius was sent forth to fight 
<A NAME="440"></A>him.
<A NAME="441"></A><BR><BR>The remainder of those in the city whom he had corrupted, Cornelius 
<A NAME="442"></A>Lentulus kept together and encouraged. He had the surname Sura, and was 
<A NAME="443"></A>a man of a noble family, but a dissolute liver, who for his debauchery 
<A NAME="444"></A>was formerly turned out of the senate, and was now holding the office of 
<A NAME="445"></A>praetor for the second time, as the custom is with those who desire to 
<A NAME="446"></A>regain the dignity of senator. It is said that he got the surname Sura 
<A NAME="447"></A>upon this occasion; being quaestor in the time of Sylla, he had lavished 
<A NAME="448"></A>away and consumed a great quantity of the public moneys, at which Sylla 
<A NAME="449"></A>being provoked, called him to give an account in the senate; he appeared 
<A NAME="450"></A>with great coolness and contempt, and said he had no account to give, but 
<A NAME="451"></A>they might take this, holding up the calf of his leg, as boys do at ball, 
<A NAME="452"></A>when they have missed. Upon which he was surnamed Sura, sura being the 
<A NAME="453"></A>Roman word for the calf of the leg. Being at another time prosecuted at 
<A NAME="454"></A>law, and having bribed some of the judges, he escaped only by two votes 
<A NAME="455"></A>and complained of the needless expense he had gone to in paying for a second, 
<A NAME="456"></A>as one would have sufficed to acquit him. This man, such in his own nature, 
<A NAME="457"></A>and now inflamed by Catiline, false prophets and fortune-tellers had also 
<A NAME="458"></A>corrupted with vain hopes, quoting to him fictitious verses and oracles, 
<A NAME="459"></A>and proving from the Sibylline prophecies that there were three of the 
<A NAME="460"></A>name Cornelius designed by fate to be monarchs of Rome; two of whom, Cinna 
<A NAME="461"></A>and Sylla, had already fulfilled the decree, and that divine fortune was 
<A NAME="462"></A>now advancing with the gift of monarchy for the remaining third Cornelius; 
<A NAME="463"></A>and that therefore he ought by all means to accept it, and not lose opportunity 
<A NAME="464"></A>by delay, as Catiline had done.
<A NAME="465"></A><BR><BR>Lentulus, therefore, designed no mean or trivial matter, for he 
<A NAME="466"></A>had resolved to kill the whole senate, and as many other citizens as he 
<A NAME="467"></A>could, to fire the city, and spare nobody, except only Pompey's children, 
<A NAME="468"></A>intending to seize and keep them as pledges of his reconciliation with 
<A NAME="469"></A>Pompey. For there was then a common and strong report that Pompey was on 
<A NAME="470"></A>his way homeward from his great expedition. The night appointed for the 
<A NAME="471"></A>design was one of the Saturnalia; swords, flax, and sulphur they carried 
<A NAME="472"></A>and hid in the house of Cethegus; and providing one hundred men, and dividing 
<A NAME="473"></A>the city into as many parts, they had allotted to every one singly his 
<A NAME="474"></A>proper place, so that in a moment, many kindling the fire, the city might 
<A NAME="475"></A>be in a flame all together. Others were appointed to stop up the aqueducts, 
<A NAME="476"></A>and to kill those who should endeavour to carry water to put it out. Whilst 
<A NAME="477"></A>these plans were preparing, it happened there were two ambassadors from 
<A NAME="478"></A>the Allobroges staying in Rome; a nation at that time in a distressed condition, 
<A NAME="479"></A>and very uneasy under the Roman government. These Lentulus and his party 
<A NAME="480"></A>judging useful instruments to move and seduce Gaul to revolt, admitted 
<A NAME="481"></A>into the conspiracy and they gave them letters to their own magistrates, 
<A NAME="482"></A>and letters to Catiline; in those they promised liberty, in these they 
<A NAME="483"></A>exhorted Catiline to set all slaves free, and to bring them along with 
<A NAME="484"></A>him to Rome. They sent also to accompany them to Catiline, one Titus, a 
<A NAME="485"></A>native of Croton, who was to carry those letters to 
<A NAME="486"></A>him.
<A NAME="487"></A><BR><BR>These counsels of inconsidering men, who conversed together over 
<A NAME="488"></A>wine and with women, Cicero watched with sober industry and forethought, 
<A NAME="489"></A>and with most admirable sagacity, having several emissaries abroad, who 
<A NAME="490"></A>observed and traced with him all that was done, and keeping also a secret 
<A NAME="491"></A>correspondence with many who pretended to join in the conspiracy. He thus 
<A NAME="492"></A>knew all the discourse which passed betwixt them and the strangers; and 
<A NAME="493"></A>lying in wait for them by night, he took the Crotonian with his letters, 
<A NAME="494"></A>the ambassadors of the Allobroges acting secretly in concert with 
<A NAME="495"></A>him.
<A NAME="496"></A><BR><BR>By break of day, he summoned the senate into the temple of Concord, 
<A NAME="497"></A>where he read the letters and examined the informers. Junius Silanus further 
<A NAME="498"></A>stated that several persons had heard Cethegus say that three consuls and 
<A NAME="499"></A>four praetors were to be slain. Piso, also, a person of consular dignity, 
<A NAME="500"></A>testified other matters of the like nature; and Caius Sulpicius, one of 
<A NAME="501"></A>the praetors, being sent to Cethegus's house, found there a quantity of 
<A NAME="502"></A>darts and of armour, and a still greater number of swords and daggers, 
<A NAME="503"></A>all recently whetted. At length, the senate decreeing indemnity to the 
<A NAME="504"></A>Crotonian upon his confession of the whole matter, Lentulus was convicted, 
<A NAME="505"></A>abjured his office (for he was then praetor), and put off his robe edged 
<A NAME="506"></A>with purple in the senate, changing it for another garment more agreeable 
<A NAME="507"></A>to his present circumstances. He thereupon, with the rest of his confederates 
<A NAME="508"></A>present, was committed to the charge of the praetors in free 
<A NAME="509"></A>custody.
<A NAME="510"></A><BR><BR>It being evening, and the common people in crowds expecting without, 
<A NAME="511"></A>Cicero went forth to them, and told them what was done, and then, attended 
<A NAME="512"></A>by them, went to the house of a friend and near neighbour; for his own 
<A NAME="513"></A>was taken up by the women who were celebrating, with secret rites the feast 
<A NAME="514"></A>of the goddess whom the Romans call the Good, and the Greeks the Women's 
<A NAME="515"></A>goddess. For a sacrifice is annually performed to her in the consul's house, 
<A NAME="516"></A>either by his wife or mother, in the presence of the vestal virgins. And 
<A NAME="517"></A>having got into his friend's house privately, a few only being present, 
<A NAME="518"></A>he began to deliberate how he should treat these men. The severest, and 
<A NAME="519"></A>the only punishment fit for such heinous crimes, he was somewhat shy and 
<A NAME="520"></A>fearful of inflicting, as well from the clemency of his nature, as also 
<A NAME="521"></A>lest he should be thought to exercise his authority too insolently, and 
<A NAME="522"></A>to treat too harshly men of the noblest birth and most powerful friendships 
<A NAME="523"></A>in the city; and yet, if he should use them more mildly, he had a dreadful 
<A NAME="524"></A>prospect of danger from them. For there was no likelihood, if they suffered 
<A NAME="525"></A>less than death, they would be reconciled, but rather, adding new rage 
<A NAME="526"></A>to their former wickedness, they would rush into every kind of audacity, 
<A NAME="527"></A>while he himself, whose character for courage already did not stand very 
<A NAME="528"></A>high with the multitude, would be thought guilty of the greatest cowardice 
<A NAME="529"></A>and want of manliness.
<A NAME="530"></A><BR><BR>Whilst Cicero was doubting what course to take, a portent happened 
<A NAME="531"></A>to the women in their sacrificing. For on the altar, where the fire seemed 
<A NAME="532"></A>wholly extinguished, a great and bright flame issued forth from the ashes 
<A NAME="533"></A>of the burnt wood; at which others were affrighted, but the holy virgins 
<A NAME="534"></A>called to Terentia, Cicero's wife, and bade her haste to her husband, and 
<A NAME="535"></A>command him to execute what he had resolved for the good of his country, 
<A NAME="536"></A>for the goddess had sent a great light to the increase of his safety and 
<A NAME="537"></A>glory. Terentia, therefore, as she was otherwise in her own nature neither 
<A NAME="538"></A>tender-hearted nor timorous, but a woman eager for distinction (who, as 
<A NAME="539"></A>Cicero himself says, would rather thrust herself into his public affairs, 
<A NAME="540"></A>than communicate her domestic matters to him), told him these things, and 
<A NAME="541"></A>excited him against the conspirators. So also did Quintus his brother, 
<A NAME="542"></A>and Publius Nigidius, one of his philosophical friends, whom he often made 
<A NAME="543"></A>use of in his greatest and most weighty affairs of state.
<A NAME="544"></A><BR><BR>The next day, a debate arising in the senate about the punishment 
<A NAME="545"></A>of the men, Silanus, being the first who was asked his opinion, said it 
<A NAME="546"></A>was fit they should be all sent to the prison, and there suffer the utmost 
<A NAME="547"></A>penalty. To him all consented in order till it came to Caius Caesar, who 
<A NAME="548"></A>was afterwards dictator. He was then but a young man, and only at the outset 
<A NAME="549"></A>of his career, but had already directed his hopes and policy to that course 
<A NAME="550"></A>by which he afterwards changed the Roman state into a monarchy. Of this 
<A NAME="551"></A>others foresaw nothing; but Cicero had seen reason for strong suspicion, 
<A NAME="552"></A>though without obtaining any sufficient means of proof. And there were 
<A NAME="553"></A>some indeed that said that he was very near being discovered, and only 
<A NAME="554"></A>just escaped him; others are of opinion that Cicero voluntarily overlooked 
<A NAME="555"></A>and neglected the evidence against him, for fear of his friends and power; 
<A NAME="556"></A>for it was very evident to everybody that if Caesar was to be accused with 
<A NAME="557"></A>the conspirators, they were more likely to be saved with him, than he to 
<A NAME="558"></A>be punished with them.
<A NAME="559"></A><BR><BR>When, therefore, it came to Caesar's turn to give his opinion, 
<A NAME="560"></A>he stood up and proposed that the conspirators should not be put to death, 
<A NAME="561"></A>but their estates confiscated, and their persons confined in such cities 
<A NAME="562"></A>in Italy as Cicero should approve, there to be kept in custody till Catiline 
<A NAME="563"></A>was conquered. To this sentence, as it was the most moderate, and he that 
<A NAME="564"></A>delivered it a most powerful speaker, Cicero himself gave no small weight, 
<A NAME="565"></A>for he stood up and, turning the scale on either side, spoke in favour 
<A NAME="566"></A>partly of the former, partly of Caesar's sentence. And all Cicero's friends, 
<A NAME="567"></A>judging Caesar's sentence most expedient for Cicero, because he would incur 
<A NAME="568"></A>the less blame if the conspirators were not put to death, chose rather 
<A NAME="569"></A>the latter; so that Silanus, also changing his mind, retracted his opinion, 
<A NAME="570"></A>and said he had not declared for capital, but only the utmost punishment, 
<A NAME="571"></A>which to a Roman senator is imprisonment. The first man who spoke Against 
<A NAME="572"></A>Caesar's motion was Catulus Lutatius. Cato followed, and so vehemently 
<A NAME="573"></A>urged in his speech the strong suspicion against Caesar himself, and so 
<A NAME="574"></A>filled the senate with anger and resolution, that a decree was passed for 
<A NAME="575"></A>the execution of the conspirators. But Caesar opposed the confiscation 
<A NAME="576"></A>of their goods, not thinking it fair that those who rejected the mildest 
<A NAME="577"></A>part of his sentence should avail themselves of the severest. And when 
<A NAME="578"></A>many insisted upon it, he appealed to the tribunes, but they would do nothing; 
<A NAME="579"></A>till Cicero himself yielding, remitted that part of the 
<A NAME="580"></A>sentence.
<A NAME="581"></A><BR><BR>After this, Cicero went out with the senate to the conspirators; 
<A NAME="582"></A>they were not all together in one place, but the several praetors had them, 
<A NAME="583"></A>some one, some another, in custody. And first he took Lentulus from the 
<A NAME="584"></A>Palatine, and brought him by the Sacred Street, through the middle of the 
<A NAME="585"></A>market-place, a circle of the most eminent citizens encompassing and protecting 
<A NAME="586"></A>him. The people, affrighted at what was doing, passed along in silence, 
<A NAME="587"></A>especially the young men; as if, with fear and trembling, they were undergoing 
<A NAME="588"></A>a rite of initiation into some ancient sacred mysteries of aristocratic 
<A NAME="589"></A>power. Thus passing from the market-place, and coming to the gaol, he delivered 
<A NAME="590"></A>Lentulus to the officer, and commanded him to execute him; and after him 
<A NAME="591"></A>Cethegus, and so all the rest in order, he brought and delivered up to 
<A NAME="592"></A>execution. And when he saw many of the conspirators in the market-place, 
<A NAME="593"></A>still standing together in companies, ignorant of what was done, and waiting 
<A NAME="594"></A>for the night, supposing the men were still alive and in a possibility 
<A NAME="595"></A>of being rescued, he called out in a loud voice, and said, "They did live;" 
<A NAME="596"></A>for so the Romans, to avoid inauspicious language, name those that are 
<A NAME="597"></A>dead.
<A NAME="598"></A><BR><BR>It was now evening, when he returned from the market-place to his 
<A NAME="599"></A>own house, the citizens no longer attending him with silence, nor in order, 
<A NAME="600"></A>but receiving him, as he passed, with acclamations and applauses, and saluting 
<A NAME="601"></A>him as the saviour and founder of his country. A bright light shone through 
<A NAME="602"></A>the streets from the lamps and torches set up at the doors, and the women 
<A NAME="603"></A>showed lights from the tops of the houses, to honour Cicero, and to behold 
<A NAME="604"></A>him returning home with a splendid train of the most principal citizens; 
<A NAME="605"></A>amongst whom were many who had conducted great wars, celebrated triumphs, 
<A NAME="606"></A>and added to the possessions of the Roman empire, both by sea and land. 
<A NAME="607"></A>These, as they passed along with him, acknowledged to one another, that 
<A NAME="608"></A>though the Roman people were indebted to several officers and commanders 
<A NAME="609"></A>of that age for riches, spoils, and power, yet to Cicero alone they owed 
<A NAME="610"></A>the safety and security of all these, for delivering them from so great 
<A NAME="611"></A>and imminent a danger. For though it might seem no wonderful thing to present 
<A NAME="612"></A>the design, and punish the conspirators, yet to defeat the greatest of 
<A NAME="613"></A>all conspiracies with so little disturbance, trouble, and commotion, was 
<A NAME="614"></A>very extraordinary. For the greater part of those who had flocked in to 
<A NAME="615"></A>Catiline, as soon as they heard the fate of Lentulus and Cethegus, left 
<A NAME="616"></A>and forsook him, and he himself, with his remaining forces, joining battle 
<A NAME="617"></A>with Antonius, was destroyed with his army.
<A NAME="618"></A><BR><BR>And yet there were some who were very ready both to speak ill of 
<A NAME="619"></A>Cicero, and to do him hurt for these actions; and they had for their leaders 
<A NAME="620"></A>some of the magistrates of the ensuing year, as Caesar, who was one of 
<A NAME="621"></A>the praetors, and Metellus and Bestia, the tribunes. These, entering upon 
<A NAME="622"></A>their office some few days before Cicero's consulate expired, would not 
<A NAME="623"></A>permit him to make any address to the people, but throwing the benches 
<A NAME="624"></A>before the rostra, hindered his speaking, telling him he might, if he pleased, 
<A NAME="625"></A>make the oath of withdrawal from office, and then come down again. Cicero, 
<A NAME="626"></A>accordingly, accepting the conditions, came forward to make his withdrawal; 
<A NAME="627"></A>and silence being made, he recited his oath, not in the usual, but in a 
<A NAME="628"></A>new and peculiar form, namely, that he had saved his country and preserved 
<A NAME="629"></A>the empire; the truth of which oath all the people confirmed with theirs. 
<A NAME="630"></A>Caesar and the tribunes, all the more exasperated by this, endeavoured 
<A NAME="631"></A>to create him further trouble, and for this purpose proposed a law for 
<A NAME="632"></A>calling Pompey home with his army, to put an end to Cicero's usurpation. 
<A NAME="633"></A>But it was a very great advantage for Cicero and the whole commonwealth 
<A NAME="634"></A>that Cato was at that time one of the tribunes. For he, being of (equal 
<A NAME="635"></A>power with the rest and of greater reputation, could oppose their designs. 
<A NAME="636"></A>He easily defeated their other projects, and in an oration to the people 
<A NAME="637"></A>so highly extolled Cicero's consulate, that the greatest honours were decreed 
<A NAME="638"></A>him, and he was publicly declared the Father of his Country, which title 
<A NAME="639"></A>he seems to have obtained, the first man who did so, when Cato gave it 
<A NAME="640"></A>to him in this address to the people.
<A NAME="641"></A><BR><BR>At this time, therefore, his authority was very great in the city; 
<A NAME="642"></A>but he treated himself much envy, and offended very many, not by any evil 
<A NAME="643"></A>action, but because he was always lauding and magnifying himself. For neither 
<A NAME="644"></A>senate, nor assembly of the people, nor court of judicature could meet, 
<A NAME="645"></A>in which he was not heard to talk of Catiline and Lentulus. Indeed, he 
<A NAME="646"></A>also filled his books and writings with his own praises, to such an excess 
<A NAME="647"></A>as to render a style, in itself most pleasant and delightful, nauseous 
<A NAME="648"></A>and irksome to his hearers; this ungrateful humour like a disease, always 
<A NAME="649"></A>cleaving to him. Nevertheless, though he was intemperately fond of his 
<A NAME="650"></A>own glory, he was very free from envying others, and was, on the contrary, 
<A NAME="651"></A>most liberally profuse in commending both the ancients and his contemporaries, 
<A NAME="652"></A>as any one may see in his writings. And many such sayings of his are also 
<A NAME="653"></A>remembered; as that he called Aristotle a river of flowing gold, and said 
<A NAME="654"></A>of Plato's Dialogues, that if Jupiter were to speak, it would be in language 
<A NAME="655"></A>like theirs. He used to call Theophrastus his special luxury. And being 
<A NAME="656"></A>asked which of Demosthenes's orations he liked best, he answered, the longest. 
<A NAME="657"></A>And yet some affected imitators of Demosthenes have complained of some 
<A NAME="658"></A>words that occur in one of his letters, to the effect that Demosthenes 
<A NAME="659"></A>sometimes falls asleep in his speeches; forgetting the many high encomiums 
<A NAME="660"></A>he continually passes upon him, and the compliment he paid him when he 
<A NAME="661"></A>named the most elaborate of all his orations, those he wrote against Antony, 
<A NAME="662"></A>Philippics. And as for the eminent men of his own time, either in eloquence 
<A NAME="663"></A>or philosophy, there was not one of them whom he did not, by writing or 
<A NAME="664"></A>speaking favourably of him, render more illustrious. He obtained of Caesar, 
<A NAME="665"></A>when in power, the Roman citizenship for Cratippus, the Peripatetic, and 
<A NAME="666"></A>got the court of Areopagus, by public decree, to request his stay at Athens, 
<A NAME="667"></A>for the instruction of their youth and the honour of their city. There 
<A NAME="668"></A>are letters extant from Cicero to Herodes, and others to his son, in which 
<A NAME="669"></A>he recommends the study of philosophy under Cratippus. There is one in 
<A NAME="670"></A>which he blames Gorgias, the rhetorician, for enticing his son into luxury 
<A NAME="671"></A>and drinking, and, therefore, forbids him his company. And this, and one 
<A NAME="672"></A>other to Pelops, the Byzantine, are the only two of his Greek epistles 
<A NAME="673"></A>which seem to be written in anger. In the first, he justly reflects on 
<A NAME="674"></A>Gorgias, if he were what he was thought to be, a dissolute and profligate 
<A NAME="675"></A>character; but in the other, he rather meanly expostulates and complains 
<A NAME="676"></A>with Pelops for neglecting to procure him a decree of certain honours from 
<A NAME="677"></A>the Byzantines.
<A NAME="678"></A><BR><BR>Another illustration of his love of praise is the way in which 
<A NAME="679"></A>sometimes, to make his orations more striking, he neglected decorum and 
<A NAME="680"></A>dignity. When Munatius, who had escaped conviction by his advocacy, immediately 
<A NAME="681"></A>prosecuted his friend Sabinus, he said in the warmth of his resentment, 
<A NAME="682"></A>"Do you suppose you were acquitted for your own merits, Munatius, and was 
<A NAME="683"></A>it not that I so darkened the case, that the court could not see your guilt?" 
<A NAME="684"></A>When from the rostra he had made a eulogy on Marcus Crassus, with much 
<A NAME="685"></A>applause, and within a few days after again as publicly reproached him, 
<A NAME="686"></A>Crassus called to him, and said, "Did not you yourself two days ago, in 
<A NAME="687"></A>this same place, commend me?" "Yes," said Cicero, "I exercised my eloquence 
<A NAME="688"></A>in declaiming upon a bad subject." At another time, Crassus had said that 
<A NAME="689"></A>no one of his family had ever lived beyond sixty years of age, and afterwards 
<A NAME="690"></A>denied it, and asked, "What should put it into my head to say so?" "It 
<A NAME="691"></A>was to gain the people's favour," answered Cicero; "you knew how glad they 
<A NAME="692"></A>would be to hear it." When Crassus expressed admiration of the Stoic doctrine, 
<A NAME="693"></A>that the good man is always rich, "Do you not mean," said Cicero, "their 
<A NAME="694"></A>doctrine that all things belong to the wise?" Crassus being generally accused 
<A NAME="695"></A>of covetousness. One of Crassus's sons, who was thought so exceedingly 
<A NAME="696"></A>like a man of the name of Axius as to throw some suspicion on his mother's 
<A NAME="697"></A>honour, made a successful speech in the senate. Cicero, on being asked 
<A NAME="698"></A>how he liked it, replied with the Greek words Axios 
<A NAME="699"></A>Crassou.
<A NAME="700"></A><BR><BR>When Crassus was about to go into Syria, he desired to leave Cicero 
<A NAME="701"></A>rather his friend than his enemy, and, therefore, one day saluting him, 
<A NAME="702"></A>told him he would come and sup with him, which the other as courteously 
<A NAME="703"></A>received. Within a few days after, on some of Cicero's acquaintances interceding 
<A NAME="704"></A>for Vatinius, as desirous of reconciliation and friendship, for he was 
<A NAME="705"></A>then his enemy, "What," he replied, "does Vatinius also wish to come and 
<A NAME="706"></A>sup with me?" Such was his way with Crassus. When Vatinius, who had swellings 
<A NAME="707"></A>in his neck, was pleading a cause he called him the tumid orator; and having 
<A NAME="708"></A>been told by some one that Vatinius was dead, on hearing, presently after, 
<A NAME="709"></A>that he was alive, "May the rascal perish," said he. "for his news not 
<A NAME="710"></A>being true."
<A NAME="711"></A><BR><BR>Upon Caesar's bringing forward a law for the division of the lands 
<A NAME="712"></A>in Campania amongst the soldiers, many in the senate opposed it; amongst 
<A NAME="713"></A>the rest, Lucius Gellius, one of the oldest men in the house, said it should 
<A NAME="714"></A>never pass whilst he lived. "Let us postpone it," said Cicero, "Gellius 
<A NAME="715"></A>does not ask us to wait long." There was a man of the name of Octavius, 
<A NAME="716"></A>suspected to be of African descent. He once said, when Cicero was pleading, 
<A NAME="717"></A>that he could not hear him; "Yet there are holes" said Cicero, "in your 
<A NAME="718"></A>ears." When Metellus Nepos told him that he had ruined more as a witness 
<A NAME="719"></A>than he had saved as an advocate, "I admit," said Cicero, "that I have 
<A NAME="720"></A>more truth than eloquence." To a young man who was suspected of having 
<A NAME="721"></A>given a poisoned cake to his father, and who talked largely of the invectives 
<A NAME="722"></A>he meant to deliver against Cicero, "Better these" replied he, "than your 
<A NAME="723"></A>cakes." Publius Sextius, having amongst others retained Cicero as his advocate 
<A NAME="724"></A>in a certain cause, was yet desirous to say all for himself, and would 
<A NAME="725"></A>not allow anybody to speak for him; when he was about to receive his acquittal 
<A NAME="726"></A>from the judges, and the ballots were passing, Cicero called to him, "Make 
<A NAME="727"></A>haste, Sextius, and use your time; to-morrow you will be nobody." He cited 
<A NAME="728"></A>Publius Cotta to bear testimony in a certain cause, one who affected to 
<A NAME="729"></A>be thought a lawyer, though ignorant and unlearned; to whom, when he had 
<A NAME="730"></A>said, "I know nothing of the matter," he answered "You think, perhaps, 
<A NAME="731"></A>we ask you about a point of law." To Metellus Nepos, who, in a dispute 
<A NAME="732"></A>between them, repeated several times, "Who was your father, Cicero?" he 
<A NAME="733"></A>replied, "Your mother has made the answer to such a question in your case 
<A NAME="734"></A>more difficult;" Nepos's mother having been of ill-repute. The son, also, 
<A NAME="735"></A>was of a giddy, uncertain temper. At one time he suddenly threw up his 
<A NAME="736"></A>office of tribune, and sailed off into Syria to Pompey; and immediately 
<A NAME="737"></A>after, with as little reason, came back again. He gave his tutor Philagrus, 
<A NAME="738"></A>a funeral with more than necessary attention, and then set up the stone 
<A NAME="739"></A>figure of a crow over his tomb. "This," said Cicero, "is really appropriate; 
<A NAME="740"></A>as he did not teach you to speak, but to fly about." When Marcus Appius, 
<A NAME="741"></A>in the opening of some speech in a court of justice said that his friend 
<A NAME="742"></A>had desired him to employ industry, eloquence, and fidelity in that cause, 
<A NAME="743"></A>Cicero answered, "And how have you had the heart not to accede to any one 
<A NAME="744"></A>of his requests?"
<A NAME="745"></A><BR><BR>To use this sharp raillery against opponents and antagonists in 
<A NAME="746"></A>judicial pleading seems allowable rhetoric. But he excited much ill-feeling 
<A NAME="747"></A>by his readiness to attack any one for the sake of a jest. A few anecdotes 
<A NAME="748"></A>of this kind may be added. Marcus Aquinius, who had two sons-in-law in 
<A NAME="749"></A>exile, received from him the name of King Adrastus. Lucius Cotta, an intemperate 
<A NAME="750"></A>lover of wine, was censor when Cicero stood for the consulship. Cicero, 
<A NAME="751"></A>being thirsty at the election, his friends stood round about him while 
<A NAME="752"></A>he was drinking. "You have reason to be afraid," he said, "lest the censor 
<A NAME="753"></A>should be angry with me for drinking water." Meeting one day Voconius with 
<A NAME="754"></A>his three very ugly daughters, he quoted the verse-
<A NAME="755"></A><BR><BR>"He reared a race without Apollo's leave." When Marcus Gellius, 
<A NAME="756"></A>who was reputed the son of a slave, had read several letters in the senate 
<A NAME="757"></A>with a very shrill and loud voice, "Wonder not," said Cicero, "he comes 
<A NAME="758"></A>of the criers." When Faustus Sylla, the son of Sylla the dictator, who 
<A NAME="759"></A>had, during his dictatorship, by public bills proscribed and condemned 
<A NAME="760"></A>so many citizens, had so far wasted his estate, and got into debt, that 
<A NAME="761"></A>he was forced to publish his bills of sale, Cicero told him that he liked 
<A NAME="762"></A>these bills much better than those of his father. By this habit he made 
<A NAME="763"></A>himself odious with many people.
<A NAME="764"></A><BR><BR>But Clodius's faction conspired against him upon the following 
<A NAME="765"></A>occasion. Clodius was a member of a noble family, in the flower of his 
<A NAME="766"></A>youth, and of a bold and resolute temper. He, being in love with Pompeia, 
<A NAME="767"></A>Caesar's wife, got privately into his house in the dress and attire of 
<A NAME="768"></A>a music-girl; the women being at that time offering there the sacrifice 
<A NAME="769"></A>which must not be seen by men, and there was no man present. Clodius, being 
<A NAME="770"></A>a youth and beardless, hoped to get to Pompeia among the women without 
<A NAME="771"></A>being taken notice of. But coming into a great house by night, he missed 
<A NAME="772"></A>his way in the passages, and a servant belonging to Aurelia, Caesar's mother, 
<A NAME="773"></A>spying him wandering up and down, inquired his name. Thus being necessitated 
<A NAME="774"></A>to speak, he told her he was seeking for one of Pompeia's maids, Abra by 
<A NAME="775"></A>name; and she, perceiving it not to be a woman's voice, shrieked out, and 
<A NAME="776"></A>called in the women; who shutting the gates, and searching every place, 
<A NAME="777"></A>at length found Clodius hidden in the chamber of the maid with whom he 
<A NAME="778"></A>had come in. This matter being much talked about, Caesar put away his wife, 
<A NAME="779"></A>Pompeia, and Clodius was prosecuted for profaning the holy 
<A NAME="780"></A>rites.
<A NAME="781"></A><BR><BR>Cicero was at this time his friend, for he had been useful to him 
<A NAME="782"></A>in the conspiracy of Catiline, as one of his forwardest assistants and 
<A NAME="783"></A>protectors. But when Clodius rested his defence upon this point, that he 
<A NAME="784"></A>was not then at Rome, but at a distance in the country, Cicero testified 
<A NAME="785"></A>that he had come to his house that day, and conversed with him on several 
<A NAME="786"></A>matters; which thing was indeed true, although Cicero was thought to testify 
<A NAME="787"></A>it not so much for the truth's sake as to preserve his quiet with Terentia 
<A NAME="788"></A>his wife. For she bore a grudge against Clodius on account of his sister 
<A NAME="789"></A>Clodia's wishing, as it was alleged, to marry Cicero, and having employed 
<A NAME="790"></A>for this purpose the intervention of Tullus, a very intimate friend of 
<A NAME="791"></A>Cicero's; and his frequent visits to Clodia, who lived in their neighbourhood, 
<A NAME="792"></A>and the attentions he paid to her had excited Terentia's suspicions, and, 
<A NAME="793"></A>being a woman of a violent temper and having the ascendant over Cicero, 
<A NAME="794"></A>she urged him on to taking a part against Clodius, and delivering his testimony. 
<A NAME="795"></A>Many other good and honest citizens also gave evidence against him, for 
<A NAME="796"></A>perjuries, disorders, bribing the people, and debauching women. Lucullus 
<A NAME="797"></A>proved, by his women-servants, that he had debauched his youngest sister 
<A NAME="798"></A>when she was Lucullus's wife; and there was a general belief that he had 
<A NAME="799"></A>done the same with his two other sisters, Tertia, whom Marcius Rex, and 
<A NAME="800"></A>Clodia, whom Metellus Celer had married; the latter of whom was called 
<A NAME="801"></A>Quadrantia, because one of her lovers had deceived her with a purse of 
<A NAME="802"></A>small copper money instead of silver, the smallest copper coin being called 
<A NAME="803"></A>a quadrant. Upon this sister's account, in particular, Clodius's character 
<A NAME="804"></A>was attacked. Notwithstanding all this, when the common people united against 
<A NAME="805"></A>the accusers and witnesses and the whole party, the judges were affrighted, 
<A NAME="806"></A>and a guard was placed about them for their defence; and most of them wrote 
<A NAME="807"></A>their sentences on the tablets in such a way that they could not well be 
<A NAME="808"></A>read. It was decided, however, that there was a majority for his acquittal, 
<A NAME="809"></A>and bribery was reported to have been employed; in reference to which Catulus 
<A NAME="810"></A>remarked, when he next met the judges, "You were very right to ask for 
<A NAME="811"></A>a guard, to prevent your money being taken from you." And when Clodius 
<A NAME="812"></A>upbraided Cicero that the judges had not believed his testimony, "Yes," 
<A NAME="813"></A>said he, "five-and-twenty of them trusted me and condemned you, and the 
<A NAME="814"></A>other thirty did not trust you, for they did not acquit you till they had 
<A NAME="815"></A>got your money."
<A NAME="816"></A><BR><BR>Caesar, though cited, did not give his testimony against Clodius, 
<A NAME="817"></A>and declared himself not convinced of his wife's adultery, but that he 
<A NAME="818"></A>had put her away because it was fit that Caesar's house should not be only 
<A NAME="819"></A>free of the evil fact, but of the fame too.
<A NAME="820"></A><BR><BR>Clodius, having escaped this danger, and having got himself chosen 
<A NAME="821"></A>one of the tribunes, immediately attacked Cicero, heaping up all matters 
<A NAME="822"></A>and inciting all persons against him. The common people he gained over 
<A NAME="823"></A>with popular laws; to each of the consuls he decreed large provinces, to 
<A NAME="824"></A>Piso, Macedonia, and to Gabinius, Syria; he made a strong party among the 
<A NAME="825"></A>indigent citizens, to support him in his proceedings, and had always a 
<A NAME="826"></A>body of armed slaves about him. Of the three men then in greatest power, 
<A NAME="827"></A>Crassus was Cicero's open enemy, Pompey indifferently made advances to 
<A NAME="828"></A>both, and Caesar was going with an army into Gaul. To him, though not his 
<A NAME="829"></A>friend (what had occurred in the time of the conspiracy having created 
<A NAME="830"></A>suspicions between them), Cicero applied, requesting an appointment as 
<A NAME="831"></A>one of his lieutenants in the province. Caesar accepted him, and Clodius, 
<A NAME="832"></A>perceiving that Cicero would thus escape his tribunician authority, professed 
<A NAME="833"></A>to be inclinable to a reconciliation, laid the greatest fault upon Terentia, 
<A NAME="834"></A>made always a favourable mention of him, and addressed him with kind expressions, 
<A NAME="835"></A>as one who felt no hatred or ill-will, but who merely wished to urge his 
<A NAME="836"></A>complaints in a moderate and friendly way. By these artifices, he so freed 
<A NAME="837"></A>Cicero of all his fears, that he resigned his appointment to Caesar, and 
<A NAME="838"></A>betook himself again to political affairs. At which Caesar, being exasperated, 
<A NAME="839"></A>joined the party of Clodius against him, and wholly alienated Pompey from 
<A NAME="840"></A>him; he also himself declared in a public assembly of the people, that 
<A NAME="841"></A>he did not think Lentulus and Cethegus, with their accomplices, were fairly 
<A NAME="842"></A>and legally put to death without being brought to trial. And this, indeed, 
<A NAME="843"></A>was the crime charged upon Cicero, and this impeachment he was summoned 
<A NAME="844"></A>to answer. And so, as an accused man, and in danger for the result, he 
<A NAME="845"></A>changed his dress, and went round with his hair untrimmed, in the attire 
<A NAME="846"></A>of a suppliant, to beg the people's grace. But Clodius met him in every 
<A NAME="847"></A>corner, having a band of abusive and daring fellows about him, who derided 
<A NAME="848"></A>Cicero for his change of dress and his humiliation, and often, by throwing 
<A NAME="849"></A>dirt and stones at him, interrupted his supplication to the 
<A NAME="850"></A>people.
<A NAME="851"></A><BR><BR>However, first of all, almost the whole equestrian order changed 
<A NAME="852"></A>their dress with him, and no less than twenty thousand young gentlemen 
<A NAME="853"></A>followed him with their hair untrimmed, and supplicating with him to the 
<A NAME="854"></A>people. And then the senate met, to pass a decree that the people should 
<A NAME="855"></A>change their dress as in time of public sorrow. But the consuls opposing 
<A NAME="856"></A>it, and Clodius with armed men besetting the senate-house, many of the 
<A NAME="857"></A>senators ran out, crying out and tearing their clothes. But this sight 
<A NAME="858"></A>moved neither shame nor pity; Cicero must either fly or determine it by 
<A NAME="859"></A>the sword with Clodius. He entreated Pompey to aid him, who was on purpose 
<A NAME="860"></A>gone out of the way, and was staying at his country-house in the Alban 
<A NAME="861"></A>hills; and first he sent his son-in-law Piso to intercede with him, and 
<A NAME="862"></A>afterwards set out to go himself. Of which Pompey being informed, would 
<A NAME="863"></A>not stay to see him, being ashamed at the remembrance of the many conflicts 
<A NAME="864"></A>in the commonwealth which Cicero had undergone in his behalf, and how much 
<A NAME="865"></A>of his policy he had directed for his advantage. But being now Caesar's 
<A NAME="866"></A>son-in-law, at his instance he had set aside all former kindness, and, 
<A NAME="867"></A>slipping out at another door, avoided the interview. Thus being forsaken 
<A NAME="868"></A>by Pompey, and left alone to himself, he fled to the consuls. Gabinius 
<A NAME="869"></A>was rough with him, as usual, but Piso spoke more courteously, desiring 
<A NAME="870"></A>him to yield and give place for a while to the fury of Clodius, and to 
<A NAME="871"></A>await a change of times, and to be now, as before, his country's saviour 
<A NAME="872"></A>from the peril of these troubles and commotions which Clodius was 
<A NAME="873"></A>exciting.
<A NAME="874"></A><BR><BR>Cicero, receiving this answer, consulted with his friends. Lucullus 
<A NAME="875"></A>advised him to stay, as being sure to prevail at last; others to fly, because 
<A NAME="876"></A>the people would soon desire him again, when they should have enough of 
<A NAME="877"></A>the rage and madness of Clodius. This last Cicero approved. But first he 
<A NAME="878"></A>took a statue of Minerva, which had been long set up and greatly honoured 
<A NAME="879"></A>in his house, and carrying it to the capitol, there dedicated it, with 
<A NAME="880"></A>the inscription, "To Minerva, Patroness of Rome." And receiving an escort 
<A NAME="881"></A>from his friends, about the middle of the night he left the city and went 
<A NAME="882"></A>by land through Lucania, intending to reach Sicily.
<A NAME="883"></A><BR><BR>But as soon as it was publicly known that he was fled, Clodius 
<A NAME="884"></A>proposed to the people a decree of exile, and by his own order interdicted 
<A NAME="885"></A>him fire and water, prohibiting any within five hundred miles in Italy 
<A NAME="886"></A>to receive him into their houses. Most people, out of respect for Cicero, 
<A NAME="887"></A>paid no regard to this edict, offering him every attention, and escorting 
<A NAME="888"></A>him on his way. But at Hipponium, a city of Lucania now called Vibo, one 
<A NAME="889"></A>Vibius, a Sicilian by birth, who, amongst many other instances of Cicero's 
<A NAME="890"></A>friendship, had been made head of the state engineers when he was consul, 
<A NAME="891"></A>would not receive him into his house, sending him word he would appoint 
<A NAME="892"></A>a place in the country for his reception. Caius Vergilius, the praetor 
<A NAME="893"></A>of Sicily, who had been on the most intimate terms with him, wrote to him 
<A NAME="894"></A>to forbear coming into Sicily. At these things Cicero, being disheartened, 
<A NAME="895"></A>went to Brundusium, whence putting forth with a prosperous wind, a contrary 
<A NAME="896"></A>gale blowing from the sea carried him back to Italy the next day. He put 
<A NAME="897"></A>again to sea, and having reached Dyrrachium, on his coming to shore there, 
<A NAME="898"></A>it is reported that an earthquake and a convulsion in the sea happened 
<A NAME="899"></A>at the same time, signs which the diviners said intimated that his exile 
<A NAME="900"></A>would not be long, for these were prognostics of change. Although many 
<A NAME="901"></A>visited him with respect, and the cities of Greece contended which should 
<A NAME="902"></A>honour him most, he yet continued disheartened and disconsolate, like an 
<A NAME="903"></A>unfortunate lover, often casting his looks back upon Italy; and, indeed, 
<A NAME="904"></A>he was become so poor-spirited, so humiliated and dejected by his misfortunes, 
<A NAME="905"></A>as none could have expected in a man who had devoted so much of his life 
<A NAME="906"></A>to study and learning. And yet he often desired his friends not to call 
<A NAME="907"></A>him orator, but philosopher, because he had made philosophy his business, 
<A NAME="908"></A>and had only used rhetoric as an instrument for attaining his objects in 
<A NAME="909"></A>public life. But the desire of glory has great power in washing the tinctures 
<A NAME="910"></A>of philosophy out of the souls of men, and in imprinting the passions of 
<A NAME="911"></A>the common people, by custom and conversation, in the minds of those that 
<A NAME="912"></A>take a part in governing them, unless the politician be very careful so 
<A NAME="913"></A>to engage in public affairs as to interest himself only in the affairs 
<A NAME="914"></A>themselves, but not participate in the passions that are consequent to 
<A NAME="915"></A>them.
<A NAME="916"></A><BR><BR>Clodius, having thus driven away Cicero, fell to burning his farms 
<A NAME="917"></A>and villas, and afterwards his city house, and built on the site of it 
<A NAME="918"></A>a temple to Liberty. The rest of his property he exposed to sale by daily 
<A NAME="919"></A>proclamation, but nobody came to buy. By these courses he became formidable 
<A NAME="920"></A>to the noble citizens, and being followed by the commonalty, whom he had 
<A NAME="921"></A>filled with insolence and licentiousness, he began at last to try his strength 
<A NAME="922"></A>against Pompey, some of whose arrangements in the countries he conquered, 
<A NAME="923"></A>he attacked. The disgrace of this made Pompey begin to reproach himself 
<A NAME="924"></A>for his cowardice in deserting Cicero, and changing his mind, he now wholly 
<A NAME="925"></A>set himself with his friends to contrive his return. And when Clodius opposed 
<A NAME="926"></A>it, the senate made a vote that no public measure should be ratified or 
<A NAME="927"></A>passed by them till Cicero was recalled. But when Lentulus was consul, 
<A NAME="928"></A>the commotions grew so high upon this matter, that the tribunes were wounded 
<A NAME="929"></A>in the Forum, and Quintus, Cicero's brother, was left as dead, lying unobserved 
<A NAME="930"></A>amongst the slain. The people began to change in their feelings, and Annius 
<A NAME="931"></A>Milo, one of their tribunes, was the first who took confidence to summon 
<A NAME="932"></A>Clodius to trial for acts of violence. Many of the common people out of 
<A NAME="933"></A>the neighbouring cities formed a party with Pompey, and he went with them, 
<A NAME="934"></A>and drove Clodius out of the Forum, and summoned the people to pass their 
<A NAME="935"></A>vote. And, it is said, the people never passed any suffrage more unanimously 
<A NAME="936"></A>than this. The senate, also, striving to outdo the people, sent letters 
<A NAME="937"></A>of thanks to those cities which had received Cicero with respect in his 
<A NAME="938"></A>exile, and decreed that his house and his country-places, which Clodius 
<A NAME="939"></A>had destroyed, should be rebuilt at the public charge.
<A NAME="940"></A><BR><BR>Thus Cicero returned sixteen months after his exile, and the cities 
<A NAME="941"></A>were so glad, and people so zealous to meet him, that what he boasted of 
<A NAME="942"></A>afterwards, that Italy had brought him on her shoulders home to Rome, was 
<A NAME="943"></A>rather less than the truth. And Crassus himself, who had been his enemy 
<A NAME="944"></A>before his exile, went then voluntarily to meet him, and was reconciled, 
<A NAME="945"></A>to please his son Publius, as he said, who was Cicero's affectionate 
<A NAME="946"></A>admirer.
<A NAME="947"></A><BR><BR>Cicero had not been long at Rome when, taking the opportunity of 
<A NAME="948"></A>Clodius's absence, he went with a great company to the capitol, and there 
<A NAME="949"></A>tore and defaced the tribunician tables, in which were recorded the acts 
<A NAME="950"></A>done in the time of Clodius. And on Clodius calling him in question for 
<A NAME="951"></A>this, he answered that he, being of the patrician order, had obtained the 
<A NAME="952"></A>office of tribune against law, and therefore nothing done by him was valid. 
<A NAME="953"></A>Cato was displeased at this, and opposed Cicero, not that he commended 
<A NAME="954"></A>Clodius, but rather disapproved of his whole administration; yet, he contended, 
<A NAME="955"></A>it was an irregular and violent course for the senate to vote the illegality 
<A NAME="956"></A>of so many decrees and acts, including those of Cato's own government in 
<A NAME="957"></A>Cyprus and at Byzantium. This occasioned a breach between Cato and Cicero, 
<A NAME="958"></A>which, though it came not to open enmity, yet made a more reserved friendship 
<A NAME="959"></A>between them.
<A NAME="960"></A><BR><BR>After this, Milo killed Clodius, and, being arraigned for the murder, 
<A NAME="961"></A>he procured Cicero as his advocate. The senate, fearing lest the questioning 
<A NAME="962"></A>of so eminent and high-spirited a citizen as Milo might disturb the peace 
<A NAME="963"></A>of the city, committed the superintendence of this and of the other trials 
<A NAME="964"></A>to Pompey, who should undertake to maintain the security alike of the city 
<A NAME="965"></A>and of the courts of justice. Pompey, therefore, went in the night, and 
<A NAME="966"></A>occupying the high grounds about it, surrounded the Forum with soldiers. 
<A NAME="967"></A>Milo, fearing lest Cicero, being disturbed by such an unusual sight, should 
<A NAME="968"></A>conduct his cause the less successfully, persuaded him to come in a litter 
<A NAME="969"></A>into the Forum, and there repose himself till the judges were set and the 
<A NAME="970"></A>court filled. For Cicero, it seems, not only wanted courage in arms, but, 
<A NAME="971"></A>in his speaking also, began with timidity, and in many cases scarcely left 
<A NAME="972"></A>off trembling and shaking when he had got thoroughly into the current and 
<A NAME="973"></A>the substance of his speech. Being to defend Licinius Murena against the 
<A NAME="974"></A>prosecution of Cato, and being eager to outdo Hortensius, who had made 
<A NAME="975"></A>his plea with great applause, he took so little rest that night, and was 
<A NAME="976"></A>so disordered with thought and overwatching, that he spoke much worse than 
<A NAME="977"></A>usual. And so now, on quitting his litter to commence the cause of Milo, 
<A NAME="978"></A>at the sight of Pompey, posted as it were, and encamped with his troops 
<A NAME="979"></A>above, and seeing arms shining round about the Forum, he was so confounded 
<A NAME="980"></A>that he could hardly begin his speech for the trembling of his body and 
<A NAME="981"></A>hesitance of his tongue; whereas Milo, meantime, was bold and intrepid 
<A NAME="982"></A>in his demeanour, disdaining either to let his hair grow or to put on the 
<A NAME="983"></A>mourning habit. And this, indeed, seems to have been one principal cause 
<A NAME="984"></A>of his condemnation. Cicero, however, was thought not so much to have shown 
<A NAME="985"></A>timidity for himself, as anxiety about his friend.
<A NAME="986"></A><BR><BR>He was made one of the priests, whom the Romans call Augurs, in 
<A NAME="987"></A>the room of Crassus the younger, dead in Parthia. Then he was appointed 
<A NAME="988"></A>by lot to the province of Cilicia, and set sail thither with twelve thousand 
<A NAME="989"></A>foot and two thousand six hundred horse. He had orders to bring back Cappadocia 
<A NAME="990"></A>to its allegiance to Ariobarzanes, its king; which settlement he effected 
<A NAME="991"></A>very completely without recourse to arms. And perceiving the Cilicians, 
<A NAME="992"></A>by the great loss the Romans had suffered in Parthia, and the commotions 
<A NAME="993"></A>in Syria, to have become disposed to attempt a revolt, by a gentle course 
<A NAME="994"></A>of government he soothed them back into fidelity. He would accept none 
<A NAME="995"></A>of the presents that were offered him by the kings; he remitted the charge 
<A NAME="996"></A>of public entertainments, but daily at his own house received the ingenious 
<A NAME="997"></A>and accomplished persons of the province, not sumptuously, but liberally. 
<A NAME="998"></A>His house had no porter, nor was he ever found in bed by any man, but early 
<A NAME="999"></A>in the morning, standing or walking before his door, he received those 
<A NAME="1000"></A>who came to offer their salutations. He is said never once to have ordered 
<A NAME="1001"></A>any of those under his command to be beaten with rods, or to have their 
<A NAME="1002"></A>garments rent. He never gave contumelious language in his anger, nor inflicted 
<A NAME="1003"></A>punishment with reproach. He detected an embezzlement, to a large amount, 
<A NAME="1004"></A>in the public money, and thus relieved the cities from their burdens, at 
<A NAME="1005"></A>the same time that he allowed those who made restitution to retain without 
<A NAME="1006"></A>further punishment their rights as citizens. He engaged too, in war, so 
<A NAME="1007"></A>far as to give a defeat to the banditti who infested Mount Amanus, for 
<A NAME="1008"></A>which he was saluted by his army Imperator. To Caecilius, the orator, who 
<A NAME="1009"></A>asked him to send him some panthers from Cilicia, to be exhibited on the 
<A NAME="1010"></A>theatre at Rome, he wrote, in commendation of his own actions, that there 
<A NAME="1011"></A>were no panthers in Cilicia, for they were all fled to Caria, in anger 
<A NAME="1012"></A>that in so general a peace they had become the sole objects of attack. 
<A NAME="1013"></A>On leaving his province, he touched at Rhodes, and tarried for some length 
<A NAME="1014"></A>of time at Athens, longing much to renew his old studies. He visited the 
<A NAME="1015"></A>eminent men of learning, and saw his former friends and companions; and 
<A NAME="1016"></A>after receiving in Greece the honours that were due to him, returned to 
<A NAME="1017"></A>the city, where everything was now just as it were in a flame, breaking 
<A NAME="1018"></A>out into a civil war.
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR><BR>When the senate would have decreed him a triumph, he told them 
<A NAME="1020"></A>he had rather, so differences were accommodated, follow the triumphal chariot 
<A NAME="1021"></A>of Caesar. In private, he gave advice to both, writing many letters to 
<A NAME="1022"></A>Caesar, and personally entreating Pompey; doing his best to soothe and 
<A NAME="1023"></A>bring to reason both the one and the other. But when matters became incurable, 
<A NAME="1024"></A>and Caesar was approaching Rome, and Pompey durst not abide it, but, with 
<A NAME="1025"></A>many honest citizens, left the city, Cicero as yet did not join in the 
<A NAME="1026"></A>flight, and was reputed to adhere to Caesar. And it is very evident he 
<A NAME="1027"></A>was in his thoughts much divided, and wavered painfully between both, for 
<A NAME="1028"></A>he writes in his epistles, "To which side should I turn? Pompey has the 
<A NAME="1029"></A>fair and honourable plea for war; and Caesar, on the other hand, has managed 
<A NAME="1030"></A>his affairs better, and is more able to secure himself and his friends. 
<A NAME="1031"></A>So that I know whom I should fly, not whom I should fly to." But when Trebatius, 
<A NAME="1032"></A>one of Caesar's friends, by letter signified to him that Caesar thought 
<A NAME="1033"></A>it was his most desirable course to join his party, and partake his hopes, 
<A NAME="1034"></A>but if he considered himself too old a man for this, then he should retire 
<A NAME="1035"></A>into Greece, and stay quietly there, out of the way of either party, Cicero, 
<A NAME="1036"></A>wondering that Caesar had not written himself, gave an angry reply, that 
<A NAME="1037"></A>he should not do anything unbecoming his past life. Such is the account 
<A NAME="1038"></A>to be collected from his letters.
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR><BR>But as soon as Caesar was marched into Spain, he immediately sailed 
<A NAME="1040"></A>away to join Pompey. And he was welcomed by all but Cato; who, taking him 
<A NAME="1041"></A>privately, chid him for coming to Pompey. As for himself, he said, it had 
<A NAME="1042"></A>been indecent to forsake that part in the commonwealth which he had chosen 
<A NAME="1043"></A>from the beginning; but Cicero might have been more useful to his country 
<A NAME="1044"></A>and friends, if, remaining neuter, he had attended and used his influence 
<A NAME="1045"></A>to moderate the result, instead of coming hither to make himself, without 
<A NAME="1046"></A>reason or necessity, an enemy to Caesar, and a partner in such great 
<A NAME="1047"></A>dangers.
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR><BR>By this language, partly, Cicero's feelings were altered, and partly, 
<A NAME="1049"></A>also, because Pompey made no great use of him. Although, indeed, he was 
<A NAME="1050"></A>himself the cause of it, by his not denying that he was sorry he had come, 
<A NAME="1051"></A>by his depreciating Pompey's resources, finding fault underhand with his 
<A NAME="1052"></A>counsels, and continually indulging in jests and sarcastic remarks on his 
<A NAME="1053"></A>fellow-soldiers. Though he went about in the camp with a gloomy and melancholy 
<A NAME="1054"></A>face himself, he was always trying to raise a laugh in others, whether 
<A NAME="1055"></A>they wished it or not. It may not be amiss to mention a few instances. 
<A NAME="1056"></A>To Domitius, on his preferring to a command one who was no soldier, and 
<A NAME="1057"></A>saying, in his defence, that he was a modest and prudent person, he replied, 
<A NAME="1058"></A>"Why did not you keep him for a tutor for or your children?" On hearing 
<A NAME="1059"></A>Theophanes, the Lesbian, who was master of the engineers in the army, praised 
<A NAME="1060"></A>for the admirable way in which he had consoled the Rhodians for the loss 
<A NAME="1061"></A>of their fleet, "What a thing it is," he said, "to have a Greek in command!" 
<A NAME="1062"></A>When Caesar had been acting successfully, and in a manner blockading Pompey, 
<A NAME="1063"></A>Lentulus was saying it was reported that Caesar's friends were out of heart; 
<A NAME="1064"></A>"Because," said Cicero, "they do not wish Caesar well." To one Marcius, 
<A NAME="1065"></A>who had just come from Italy, and told them that there was a strong report 
<A NAME="1066"></A>at Rome that Pompey was blocked up, he said, "And you sailed hither to 
<A NAME="1067"></A>see it with your own eyes." To Nonius, encouraging them after a defeat 
<A NAME="1068"></A>to be of good hope, because there were seven eagles still left in Pompey's 
<A NAME="1069"></A>camp, "Good reason for encouragement," said Cicero, "if we were going to 
<A NAME="1070"></A>fight with jackdaws." Labienus insisted on some prophecies to the effect 
<A NAME="1071"></A>that Pompey would gain the victory; "Yes," said Cicero; "and the first 
<A NAME="1072"></A>step in the campaign has been losing our camp."
<A NAME="1073"></A><BR><BR>After the battle of Pharsalia was over, at which he was not present 
<A NAME="1074"></A>for want of health, and Pompey was fled, Cato, having considerable forces 
<A NAME="1075"></A>and a great fleet at Dyrrachium, would have had Cicero commander-in-chief, 
<A NAME="1076"></A>according to law and the precedence of his consular dignity. And on his 
<A NAME="1077"></A>refusing the command, and wholly declining to take part in their plans 
<A NAME="1078"></A>for continuing the war, he was in the greatest danger of being killed, 
<A NAME="1079"></A>young Pompey and his friends calling him traitor, and drawing their swords 
<A NAME="1080"></A>upon him; only that Cato interposed, and hardly rescued and brought him 
<A NAME="1081"></A>out of the camp.
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR><BR>Afterwards, arriving at Brundusium, he tarried there some time 
<A NAME="1083"></A>in expectation of Caesar, who was delayed by his affairs in Asia and Egypt. 
<A NAME="1084"></A>And when it was told him that he was arrived at Tarentum, and was coming 
<A NAME="1085"></A>thence by land to Brundusium, he hastened towards him, not altogether without 
<A NAME="1086"></A>hope, and yet in some fear of making experiment of the temper of an enemy 
<A NAME="1087"></A>and conqueror in the presence of many witnesses. But there was no necessity 
<A NAME="1088"></
