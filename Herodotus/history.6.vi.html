<A NAME="10"></A><B>Erato</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>Aristagoras, the author of the Ionian revolt, perished in the way 
<A NAME="12"></A>which I have described. Meanwhile Histiaeus, tyrant of Miletus, who had 
<A NAME="13"></A>been allowed by Darius to leave Susa, came down to Sardis. On his arrival, 
<A NAME="14"></A>being asked by Artaphernes, the Sardian satrap, what he thought was the 
<A NAME="15"></A>reason that the Ionians had rebelled, he made answer that he could not 
<A NAME="16"></A>conceive, and it had astonished him greatly, pretending to be quite unconscious 
<A NAME="17"></A>of the whole business. Artaphernes, however, who perceived that he was 
<A NAME="18"></A>dealing dishonestly, and who had in fact full knowledge of the whole history 
<A NAME="19"></A>of the outbreak, said to him, "I will tell thee how the case stands, Histiaeus: 
<A NAME="20"></A>this shoe is of thy stitching; Aristagoras has but put it 
<A NAME="21"></A>on."
<A NAME="22"></A><BR><BR>Such was the remark made by Artaphernes concerning the rebellion. 
<A NAME="23"></A>Histiaeus, alarmed at the knowledge which he displayed, so soon as night 
<A NAME="24"></A>fell, fled away to the coast. Thus he forfeited his word to Darius; for 
<A NAME="25"></A>though he had pledged himself to bring Sardinia, the biggest island in 
<A NAME="26"></A>the whole world, under the Persian yoke, he in reality sought to obtain 
<A NAME="27"></A>the direction of the war against the king. Crossing over to Chios, he was 
<A NAME="28"></A>there laid in bonds by the inhabitants, who accused him of intending some 
<A NAME="29"></A>mischief against them in the interest of Darius. However, when the whole 
<A NAME="30"></A>truth was laid before them, and they found that Histiaeus was in reality 
<A NAME="31"></A>a foe to the king, they forthwith set him at large again.
<A NAME="32"></A><BR><BR>After this the Ionians inquired of him for what reason he had so 
<A NAME="33"></A>strongly urged Aristagoras to revolt from the king, thereby doing their 
<A NAME="34"></A>nation so ill a service. In reply, he took good care not to disclose to 
<A NAME="35"></A>them the real cause, but told them that King Darius had intended to remove 
<A NAME="36"></A>the Phoenicians from their own country, and place them in Ionia, while 
<A NAME="37"></A>he planted the Ionians in Phoenicia, and that it was for this reason he 
<A NAME="38"></A>sent Aristagoras the order. Now it was not true that the king had entertained 
<A NAME="39"></A>any such intention, but Histiaeus succeeded hereby in arousing the fears 
<A NAME="40"></A>of the Ionians.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR><BR>After this, Histiaeus, by means of a certain Hermippus, a native 
<A NAME="42"></A>of Atarneus, sent letters to many of the Persians in Sardis, who had before 
<A NAME="43"></A>held some discourse with him concerning a revolt. Hermippus, however, instead 
<A NAME="44"></A>of conveying them to the persons to whom they were addressed, delivered 
<A NAME="45"></A>them into the hands of Artaphernes, who, perceiving what was on foot, commanded 
<A NAME="46"></A>Hermippus to deliver the letters according to their addresses, and then 
<A NAME="47"></A>bring him back the answers which were sent to Histiaeus. The traitors being 
<A NAME="48"></A>in this way discovered, Artaphernes put a number of Persians to death, 
<A NAME="49"></A>and caused a commotion in Sardis.
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR>As for Histiaeus, when his hopes in this matter were disappointed, 
<A NAME="51"></A>he persuaded the Chians to carry him back to Miletus; but the Milesians 
<A NAME="52"></A>were too well pleased at having got quit of Aristagoras to be anxious to 
<A NAME="53"></A>receive another tyrant into their country; besides which they had now tasted 
<A NAME="54"></A>liberty. They therefore opposed his return; and when he endeavoured to 
<A NAME="55"></A>force an entrance during the night, one of the inhabitants even wounded 
<A NAME="56"></A>him in the thigh. Having been thus rejected from his country, he went back 
<A NAME="57"></A>to Chios; whence, after failing in an attempt to induce the Chians to give 
<A NAME="58"></A>him ships, he crossed over to Mytilene, where he succeeded in obtaining 
<A NAME="59"></A>vessels from the Lesbians. They fitted out a squadron of eight triremes, 
<A NAME="60"></A>and sailed with him to the Hellespont, where they took up their station, 
<A NAME="61"></A>and proceeded to seize all the vessels which passed out from the Euxine, 
<A NAME="62"></A>unless the crews declared themselves ready to obey his 
<A NAME="63"></A>orders.
<A NAME="64"></A><BR><BR>While Histiaeus and the Mytilenaeans were thus employed, Miletus 
<A NAME="65"></A>was expecting an attack from a vast armament, which comprised both a fleet 
<A NAME="66"></A>and also a land force. The Persian captains had drawn their several detachments 
<A NAME="67"></A>together, and formed them into a single army; and had resolved to pass 
<A NAME="68"></A>over all the other cities, which they regarded as of lesser account, and 
<A NAME="69"></A>to march straight on Miletus. Of the naval states, Phoenicia showed the 
<A NAME="70"></A>greatest zeal; but the fleet was composed likewise of the Cyprians (who 
<A NAME="71"></A>had so lately been brought under), the Cilicians, and also the 
<A NAME="72"></A>Egyptians.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>While the Persians were thus making preparations against Miletus 
<A NAME="74"></A>and Ionia, the Ionians, informed of their intent, sent their deputies to 
<A NAME="75"></A>the Panionium, and held a council upon the posture of their affairs. Hereat 
<A NAME="76"></A>it was determined that no land force should be collected to oppose the 
<A NAME="77"></A>Persians, but that the Milesians should be left to defend their own walls 
<A NAME="78"></A>as they could; at the same time they agreed that the whole naval force 
<A NAME="79"></A>of the states, not excepting a single ship, should be equipped, and should 
<A NAME="80"></A>muster at Lade, a small island lying off Miletus- to give battle on behalf 
<A NAME="81"></A>of the place.
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR>Presently the Ionians began to assemble in their ships, and with 
<A NAME="83"></A>them came the Aeolians of Lesbos; and in this way they marshalled their 
<A NAME="84"></A>line:- The wing towards the east was formed of the Milesians themselves, 
<A NAME="85"></A>who furnished eighty ships; next to them came the Prienians with twelve, 
<A NAME="86"></A>and the Myusians with three ships; after the Myusians were stationed the 
<A NAME="87"></A>Teians, whose ships were seventeen; then the Chians, who furnished a hundred. 
<A NAME="88"></A>The Erythraeans and Phocaeans followed, the former with eight, the latter 
<A NAME="89"></A>with three ships; beyond the Phocaeans were the Lesbians, furnishing seventy; 
<A NAME="90"></A>last of all came the Samians, forming the western wing, and furnishing 
<A NAME="91"></A>sixty vessels. The fleet amounted in all to three hundred and fifty-three 
<A NAME="92"></A>triremes. Such was the number on the Ionian side.
<A NAME="93"></A><BR><BR>On the side of the barbarians the number of vessels was six hundred. 
<A NAME="94"></A>These assembled off the coast of Milesia, while the land army collected 
<A NAME="95"></A>upon the shore; but the leaders, learning the strength of the Ionian fleet, 
<A NAME="96"></A>began to fear lest they might fail to defeat them, in which case, not having 
<A NAME="97"></A>the mastery at sea, they would be unable to reduce Miletus, and might in 
<A NAME="98"></A>consequence receive rough treatment at the hands of Darius. So when they 
<A NAME="99"></A>thought of all these things, they resolved on the following course:- Calling 
<A NAME="100"></A>together the Ionian tyrants, who had fled to the Medes for refuge when 
<A NAME="101"></A>Aristagoras deposed them from their governments, and who were now in camp, 
<A NAME="102"></A>having joined in the expedition against Miletus, the Persians addressed 
<A NAME="103"></A>them thus: "Men of Ionia, now is the fit time to show your zeal for the 
<A NAME="104"></A>house of the king. Use your best efforts, every one of you, to detach your 
<A NAME="105"></A>fellow-countrymen from the general body. Hold forth to them the promise 
<A NAME="106"></A>that, if they submit, no harm shall happen to them on account of their 
<A NAME="107"></A>rebellion; their temples shall not be burnt, nor any of their private buildings; 
<A NAME="108"></A>neither shall they be treated with greater harshness than before the outbreak. 
<A NAME="109"></A>But if they refuse to yield, and determine to try the chance of a battle, 
<A NAME="110"></A>threaten them with the fate which shall assuredly overtake them in that 
<A NAME="111"></A>case. Tell them, when they are vanquished in fight, they shall be enslaved; 
<A NAME="112"></A>their boys shall be made eunuchs, and their maidens transported to Bactra; 
<A NAME="113"></A>while their country shall be delivered into the hands of 
<A NAME="114"></A>foreigners."
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR>Thus spake the Persians. The Ionian tyrants sent accordingly by 
<A NAME="116"></A>night to their respective citizens, and reported the words of the Persians; 
<A NAME="117"></A>but the people were all staunch, and refused to betray their countrymen, 
<A NAME="118"></A>those of each state thinking that they alone had had made to them. Now 
<A NAME="119"></A>these events happened on the first appearance of the Persians before 
<A NAME="120"></A>Miletus.
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR>Afterwards, while the Ionian fleet was still assembled at Lade, 
<A NAME="122"></A>councils were held, and speeches made by divers persons- among the rest 
<A NAME="123"></A>by Dionysius, the Phocaean captain, who thus expressed himself:- "Our affairs 
<A NAME="124"></A>hang on the razor's edge, men of Ionia, either to be free or to be slaves; 
<A NAME="125"></A>and slaves, too, who have shown themselves runaways. Now then you have 
<A NAME="126"></A>to choose whether you will endure hardships, and so for the present lead 
<A NAME="127"></A>a life of toil, but thereby gain ability to overcome your enemies and establish 
<A NAME="128"></A>your own freedom; or whether you will persist in this slothfulness and 
<A NAME="129"></A>disorder, in which case I see no hope of your escaping the king's vengeance 
<A NAME="130"></A>for your rebellion. I beseech you, be persuaded by me, and trust yourselves 
<A NAME="131"></A>to my guidance. Then, if the gods only hold the balance fairly between 
<A NAME="132"></A>us, I undertake to say that our foes will either decline a battle, or, 
<A NAME="133"></A>if they fight, suffer complete discomfiture."
<A NAME="134"></A><BR><BR>These words prevailed with the Ionians, and forthwith they committed 
<A NAME="135"></A>themselves to Dionysius; whereupon he proceeded every day to make the ships 
<A NAME="136"></A>move in column, and the rowers ply their oars, and exercise themselves 
<A NAME="137"></A>in breaking the line; while the marines were held under arms, and the vessels 
<A NAME="138"></A>were kept, till evening fell, upon their anchors, so that the men had nothing 
<A NAME="139"></A>but toil from morning even to night. Seven days did the Ionians continue 
<A NAME="140"></A>obedient, and do whatsoever he bade them; but on the eighth day, worn out 
<A NAME="141"></A>by the hardness of the work and the heat of the sun, and quite unaccustomed 
<A NAME="142"></A>to such fatigues, they began to confer together, and to say one to another, 
<A NAME="143"></A>"What god have we offended to bring upon ourselves such a punishment as 
<A NAME="144"></A>this? Fools and distracted that we were, to put ourselves into the hands 
<A NAME="145"></A>of this Phocaean braggart, who does but furnish three ships to the fleet! 
<A NAME="146"></A>He, now that he has got us, plagues us in the most desperate fashion; many 
<A NAME="147"></A>of us, in consequence, have fallen sick already- many more expect to follow. 
<A NAME="148"></A>We had better suffer anything rather than these hardships; even the slavery 
<A NAME="149"></A>with which we are threatened, however harsh, can be no worse than our present 
<A NAME="150"></A>thraldom. Come, let us refuse him obedience." So saying, they forthwith 
<A NAME="151"></A>ceased to obey his orders, and pitched their tents, as if they had been 
<A NAME="152"></A>soldiers, upon the island, where they reposed under the shade all day, 
<A NAME="153"></A>and refused to go aboard the ships and train themselves.
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR>Now when the Samian captains perceived what was taking place, they 
<A NAME="155"></A>were more inclined than before to accept the terms which Aeaces, the son 
<A NAME="156"></A>of Syloson, had been authorised by the Persians to offer them, on condition 
<A NAME="157"></A>of their deserting from the confederacy. For they saw that all was disorder 
<A NAME="158"></A>among the Ionians, and they felt also that it was hopeless to contend with 
<A NAME="159"></A>the power of the king; since if they defeated the fleet which had been 
<A NAME="160"></A>sent against them, they knew that another would come five times as great. 
<A NAME="161"></A>So they took advantage of the occasion which now offered, and as soon as 
<A NAME="162"></A>ever they saw the Ionians refuse to work, hastened gladly to provide for 
<A NAME="163"></A>the safety of their temples and their properties. This Aeaces, who made 
<A NAME="164"></A>the overtures to the Samians, was the son of Syloson, and grandson of the 
<A NAME="165"></A>earlier Aeaces. He had formerly been tyrant of Samos, but was ousted from 
<A NAME="166"></A>his government by Aristagoras the Milesian, at the same time with the other 
<A NAME="167"></A>tyrants of the Ionians.
<A NAME="168"></A><BR><BR>The Phoenicians soon afterwards sailed to the attack; and the Ionians 
<A NAME="169"></A>likewise put themselves in line, and went out to meet them. When they had 
<A NAME="170"></A>now neared one another, and joined battle, which of the Ionians fought 
<A NAME="171"></A>like brave men and which like cowards, I cannot declare with any certainty, 
<A NAME="172"></A>for charges are brought on all sides; but the tale goes that the Samians, 
<A NAME="173"></A>according to the agreement which they had made with Aeaces, hoisted sail, 
<A NAME="174"></A>and quitting their post bore away for Samos, except eleven ships, whose 
<A NAME="175"></A>captains gave no heed to the orders of the commanders, but remained and 
<A NAME="176"></A>took part in the battle. The state of Samos, in consideration of this action, 
<A NAME="177"></A>granted to these men, as an acknowledgment if their bravery, the honour 
<A NAME="178"></A>of having their names, and the names of their fathers, inscribed upon a 
<A NAME="179"></A>pillar, which still stands in the market-place. The Lesbians also, when 
<A NAME="180"></A>they saw the Samians, who were drawn up next them, begin to flee, themselves 
<A NAME="181"></A>did the like; and the example, once set, was followed by the greater number 
<A NAME="182"></A>of the Ionians.
<A NAME="183"></A><BR><BR>Of those who remained and fought, none were so rudely handled as 
<A NAME="184"></A>the Chians, who displayed prodigies of valour, and disdained to play the 
<A NAME="185"></A>part of cowards. They furnished to the common fleet, as I mentioned above, 
<A NAME="186"></A>one hundred ships, having each of them forty armed citizens, and those 
<A NAME="187"></A>picked men, on board; and when they saw the greater portion of the allies 
<A NAME="188"></A>betraying the common cause, they for their part, scorning to imitate the 
<A NAME="189"></A>base conduct of these traitors, although they were left almost alone and 
<A NAME="190"></A>unsupported, a very few friends continuing to stand by them, notwithstanding 
<A NAME="191"></A>went on with the fight, and ofttimes cut the line of the enemy, until at 
<A NAME="192"></A>last, after they had taken very many of their adversaries' ships, they 
<A NAME="193"></A>ended by losing more than half of their own. Hereupon, with the remainder 
<A NAME="194"></A>of their vessels, the Chians fled away to their own 
<A NAME="195"></A>country.
<A NAME="196"></A><BR><BR>As for such of their ships as were damaged and disabled, these, 
<A NAME="197"></A>being pursued by the enemy, made straight for Mycale, where the crews ran 
<A NAME="198"></A>them ashore, and abandoning them began their march along the continent. 
<A NAME="199"></A>Happening in their way upon the territory of Ephesus, they essayed to cross 
<A NAME="200"></A>it; but here a dire misfortune befell them. It was night, and the Ephesian 
<A NAME="201"></A>women chanced to be engaged in celebrating the Thesmophoria- the previous 
<A NAME="202"></A>calamity of the Chians had not been heard of- so when the Ephesians saw 
<A NAME="203"></A>their country invaded by an armed band, they made no question of the new-comers 
<A NAME="204"></A>being robbers who purposed to carry off their women; and accordingly they 
<A NAME="205"></A>marched out against them in full force, and slew them all. Such were the 
<A NAME="206"></A>misfortunes which befell them of Chios.
<A NAME="207"></A><BR><BR>Dionysius, the Phocaean, when he perceived that all was lost, having 
<A NAME="208"></A>first captured three ships from the enemy, himself took to flight. He would 
<A NAME="209"></A>not, however, return to Phocaea, which he well knew must fall again, like 
<A NAME="210"></A>the rest of Ionia, under the Persian yoke; but straightway, as he was, 
<A NAME="211"></A>he set sail for Phoenicia, and there sunk a number of merchantmen, and 
<A NAME="212"></A>gained a great booty; after which he directed his course to Sicily, where 
<A NAME="213"></A>he established himself as a corsair, and plundered the Carthaginians and 
<A NAME="214"></A>Tyrrhenians, but did no harm to the Greeks.
<A NAME="215"></A><BR><BR>The Persians, when they had vanquished the Ionians in the sea-fight, 
<A NAME="216"></A>besieged Miletus both by land and sea, driving mines under the walls, and 
<A NAME="217"></A>making use of every known device, until at length they took both the citadel 
<A NAME="218"></A>and the town, six years from the time when the revolt first broke out under 
<A NAME="219"></A>Aristagoras. All the inhabitants of the city they reduced to slavery, and 
<A NAME="220"></A>thus the event tallied with the announcement which had been made by the 
<A NAME="221"></A>oracle.
<A NAME="222"></A><BR><BR>For once upon a time, when the Argives had sent to Delphi to consult 
<A NAME="223"></A>the god about the safety of their own city, a prophecy was given them, 
<A NAME="224"></A>in which others besides themselves were interested; for while it bore in 
<A NAME="225"></A>part upon the fortunes of Argos, it touched in a by-clause the fate of 
<A NAME="226"></A>the men of Miletus. I shall set down the portion which concerned the Argives 
<A NAME="227"></A>when I come to that part of my History, mentioning at present only the 
<A NAME="228"></A>passage in which the absent Milesians were spoken of. This passage was 
<A NAME="229"></A>as follows:-
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR>Then shalt thou, Miletus, so oft the contriver of 
<A NAME="231"></A>evil,
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>Be, thyself, to many a least and an excellent booty:
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>Then shall thy matrons wash the feet of long-haired 
<A NAME="234"></A>masters-
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>Others shall then possess our lov'd Didymian temple. Such a fate now 
<A NAME="236"></A>befell the Milesians; for the Persians, who wore their hair long, after 
<A NAME="237"></A>killing most of the men, made the women and children slaves; and the sanctuary 
<A NAME="238"></A>at Didyma, the oracle no less than the temple was plundered and burnt; 
<A NAME="239"></A>of the riches whereof I have made frequent mention in other parts of my 
<A NAME="240"></A>History.
<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR>Those of the Milesians whose lives were spared, being carried prisoners 
<A NAME="242"></A>to Susa, received no ill treatment at the hands of King Darius, but were 
<A NAME="243"></A>established by him in Ampe, a city on the shores of the Erythraean sea, 
<A NAME="244"></A>near the spot where the Tigris flows into it. Miletus itself, and the plain 
<A NAME="245"></A>about the city, were kept by the Persians for themselves, while the hill-country 
<A NAME="246"></A>was assigned to the Carians of Pedasus.
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR>And now the Sybarites, who after the loss of their city occupied 
<A NAME="248"></A>Laus and Scidrus, failed duly to return the former kindness of the Milesians. 
<A NAME="249"></A>For these last, when Sybaris was taken by the Crotoniats, made a great 
<A NAME="250"></A>mourning, all of them, youths as well as men, shaving their heads; since 
<A NAME="251"></A>Miletus and Sybaris were, of all the cities whereof we have any knowledge, 
<A NAME="252"></A>the two most closely united to one another. The Athenians, on the other 
<A NAME="253"></A>hand, showed themselves beyond measure afflicted at the fall of Miletus, 
<A NAME="254"></A>in many ways expressing their sympathy, and especially by their treatment 
<A NAME="255"></A>of Phrynichus. For when this poet brought out upon the stage his drama 
<A NAME="256"></A>of the Capture of Miletus, the whole theatre burst into tears; and the 
<A NAME="257"></A>people sentenced him to pay a fine of a thousand drachms, for recalling 
<A NAME="258"></A>to them their own misfortunes. They likewise made a law that no one should 
<A NAME="259"></A>ever again exhibit that piece.
<A NAME="260"></A><BR><BR>Thus was Miletus bereft of its inhabitants. In Samos the people 
<A NAME="261"></A>of the richer sort were much displeased with the doings of the captains, 
<A NAME="262"></A>and the dealings they had had the Medes; they therefore held a council, 
<A NAME="263"></A>very shortly after the sea-fight, and resolved that they would not remain 
<A NAME="264"></A>to become the slaves of Aeaces and the Persians, but before the tyrant 
<A NAME="265"></A>set foot in their country, would sail away and found a colony in another 
<A NAME="266"></A>land. Now it chanced that about this time the Zanclaeans of Sicily had 
<A NAME="267"></A>sent ambassadors to the Ionians, and invited them to Kale-Acte where they 
<A NAME="268"></A>wished an Ionian city to be founded. This place, Kale-Acte (or the Fair 
<A NAME="269"></A>Strand) as it is called, is in the country of the Sicilians, and is situated 
<A NAME="270"></A>in the part of Sicily which looks towards Tyrrhenia. The offer thus made 
<A NAME="271"></A>to all the Ionians was embraced only by the Samians, and by such of the 
<A NAME="272"></A>Milesians as had contrived to effect their escape.
<A NAME="273"></A><BR><BR>Hereupon this is what ensued. The Samians on their voyage reached 
<A NAME="274"></A>the country of the Epizephyrian Locrians, at a time when the Zanclaeans 
<A NAME="275"></A>and their king Scythas were engaged in the siege of a Sicilian town which 
<A NAME="276"></A>they hoped to take. Anaxilaus, tyrant of Rhegium, who was on ill terms 
<A NAME="277"></A>with the Zanclaeans knowing how matters stood, made application to the 
<A NAME="278"></A>Samians, and persuaded them to give up the thought of Kale-Acte the place 
<A NAME="279"></A>to which they were bound, and to seize Zancle itself, which was left without 
<A NAME="280"></A>men. The Samians followed this counsel and possessed themselves of the 
<A NAME="281"></A>town; which the Zanclaeans no sooner heard than they hurried to the rescue, 
<A NAME="282"></A>calling to their aid Hippocrates, tyrant of Gela, who was one of their 
<A NAME="283"></A>allies. Hippocrates came with his army to their assistance; but on his 
<A NAME="284"></A>arrival he seized Scythas, the Zanclaean king, who had just lost his city, 
<A NAME="285"></A>and sent him away in chains, together with his brother Pythogenes, to the 
<A NAME="286"></A>town of Inycus; after which he came to an understanding with the Samians, 
<A NAME="287"></A>exchanged oaths with them, and agreed to betray the people of Zancle. The 
<A NAME="288"></A>reward of his treachery was to be one-half of the goods and chattels, including 
<A NAME="289"></A>slaves, which the town contained, and all that he could find in the open 
<A NAME="290"></A>country. Upon this Hippocrates seized and bound the greater number of the 
<A NAME="291"></A>Zanclaeans as slaves; delivering, however, into the hands of the Samians 
<A NAME="292"></A>three hundred of the principal citizens, to be slaughtered; but the Samians 
<A NAME="293"></A>spared the lives of these persons.
<A NAME="294"></A><BR><BR>Scythas, the king of the Zanclaeans, made his escape from Inycus, 
<A NAME="295"></A>and fled to Himera; whence he passed into Asia, and went up to the court 
<A NAME="296"></A>of Darius. Darius thought him the most upright of all the Greeks to whom 
<A NAME="297"></A>he afforded a refuge; for with the king's leave he paid a visit to Sicily, 
<A NAME="298"></A>and thence returned back to Persia, where he lived in great comfort, and 
<A NAME="299"></A>died by a natural death at an advanced age.
<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR>Thus did the Samians escape the yoke of the Medes, and possess 
<A NAME="301"></A>themselves without any trouble of Zancle, a most beautiful city. At Samos 
<A NAME="302"></A>itself the Phoenicians, after the fight which had Miletus for its prize 
<A NAME="303"></A>was over, re-established Aeaces, the son of Syloson, upon his throne. This 
<A NAME="304"></A>they did by the command of the Persians, who looked upon Aeaces as one 
<A NAME="305"></A>who had rendered them a high service and therefore deserved well at their 
<A NAME="306"></A>hands. They likewise spared the Samians, on account of the desertion of 
<A NAME="307"></A>their vessels, and did not burn either their city or their temples, as 
<A NAME="308"></A>they did those of the other rebels. Immediately after the fall of Miletus 
<A NAME="309"></A>the Persians recovered Caria, bringing some of the cities over by force, 
<A NAME="310"></A>while others submitted of their own accord.
<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile tidings of what had befallen Miletus reached Histiaeus 
<A NAME="312"></A>the Milesian, who was still at Byzantium, employed in intercepting the 
<A NAME="313"></A>Ionian merchantmen as they issued from the Euxine. Histiaeus had no sooner 
<A NAME="314"></A>heard the news than he gave the Hellespont in charge to Bisaltes, son of 
<A NAME="315"></A>Apollophanes, a native of Abydos, and himself, at the head of his Lesbians, 
<A NAME="316"></A>set sail for Chios. One of the Chian garrisons which opposed him he engaged 
<A NAME="317"></A>at a place called "The Hollows," situated in the Chian territory, and of 
<A NAME="318"></A>these he slaughtered a vast number; afterwards, by the help of his Lesbians, 
<A NAME="319"></A>he reduced all the rest of the Chians, who were weakened by their losses 
<A NAME="320"></A>in the sea-fight, Polichne, a city of Chios, serving him as 
<A NAME="321"></A>head-quarters.
<A NAME="322"></A><BR><BR>It mostly happens that there is some warning when great misfortunes 
<A NAME="323"></A>are about to befall a state or nation; and so it was in this instance, 
<A NAME="324"></A>for the Chians had previously had some strange tokens sent to them. A choir 
<A NAME="325"></A>of a hundred of their youths had been despatched to Delphi; and of these 
<A NAME="326"></A>only two had returned; the remaining ninety-eight having been carried off 
<A NAME="327"></A>by a pestilence. Likewise, about the same time, and very shortly before 
<A NAME="328"></A>the sea-fight, the roof of a school-house had fallen in upon a number of 
<A NAME="329"></A>their boys, who were at lessons; and out of a hundred and twenty children 
<A NAME="330"></A>there was but one left alive. Such were the signs which God sent to warn 
<A NAME="331"></A>them. It was very shortly afterwards that the sea-fight happened, which 
<A NAME="332"></A>brought the city down upon its knees; and after the sea-fight came the 
<A NAME="333"></A>attack of Histiaeus and his Lesbians, to whom the Chians, weakened as they 
<A NAME="334"></A>were, furnished an easy conquest.
<A NAME="335"></A><BR><BR>Histiaeus now led a numerous army, composed of Ionians and Aelians, 
<A NAME="336"></A>against Thasos, and had laid siege to the place when news arrived that 
<A NAME="337"></A>the Phoenicians were about to quit Miletus and attack the other cities 
<A NAME="338"></A>of Ionia. On hearing this, Histiaeus raised the siege of Thasos, and hastened 
<A NAME="339"></A>to Lesbos with all his forces. There his army was in great straits for 
<A NAME="340"></A>want of food; whereupon Histiaeus left Lesbos and went across to the mainland, 
<A NAME="341"></A>intending to cut the crops which were growing in the Atarnean territory, 
<A NAME="342"></A>and likewise in the plain of the Caicus, which belonged to Mysia. Now it 
<A NAME="343"></A>chanced that a certain Persian named Harpagus was in these regions at the 
<A NAME="344"></A>head of an army of no little strength. He, when Histiaeus landed, marched 
<A NAME="345"></A>out to meet him, and engaging with his forces destroyed the greater number 
<A NAME="346"></A>of them, and took Histiaeus himself prisoner.
<A NAME="347"></A><BR><BR>Histiaeus fell into the hands of the Persians in the following 
<A NAME="348"></A>manner. The Greeks and Persians engaged at Malena, in the region of Atarneus; 
<A NAME="349"></A>and the battle was for a long time stoutly contested, till at length the 
<A NAME="350"></A>cavalry came up, and, charging the Greeks, decided the conflict. The Greeks 
<A NAME="351"></A>fled; and Histiaeus, who thought that Darius would not punish his fault 
<A NAME="352"></A>with death, showed how he loved his life by the following conduct. Overtaken 
<A NAME="353"></A>in his flight by one of the Persians, who was about to run him through, 
<A NAME="354"></A>he cried aloud in the Persian tongue that he was Histiaeus the 
<A NAME="355"></A>Milesian.
<A NAME="356"></A><BR><BR>Now, had he been taken straightway before King Darius, I verily 
<A NAME="357"></A>believe that he would have received no hurt, but the king would have freely 
<A NAME="358"></A>forgiven him. Artaphernes, however, satrap of Sardis, and his captor Harpagus, 
<A NAME="359"></A>on this very account- because they were afraid that, if he escaped, he 
<A NAME="360"></A>would be again received into high favour by the king- put him to death 
<A NAME="361"></A>as soon as he arrived at Sardis. His body they impaled at that place, while 
<A NAME="362"></A>they embalmed his head and sent it up to Susa to the king. Darius, when 
<A NAME="363"></A>he learnt what had taken place, found great fault with the men engaged 
<A NAME="364"></A>in this business for not bringing Histiaeus alive into his presence, and 
<A NAME="365"></A>commanded his servants to wash and dress the head with all care, and then 
<A NAME="366"></A>bury it, as the head of a man who had been a great benefactor to himself 
<A NAME="367"></A>and the Persians. Such was the sequel of the history of 
<A NAME="368"></A>Histiaeus.
<A NAME="369"></A><BR><BR>The naval armament of the Persians wintered at Miletus, and in 
<A NAME="370"></A>the following year proceeded to attack the islands off the coast, Chios, 
<A NAME="371"></A>Lesbos, and Tenedos, which were reduced without difficulty. Whenever they 
<A NAME="372"></A>became masters of an island, the barbarians, in every single instance, 
<A NAME="373"></A>netted the inhabitants. Now the mode in which they practise this netting 
<A NAME="374"></A>is the following. Men join hands, so as to form a line across from the 
<A NAME="375"></A>north coast to the south, and then march through the island from end to 
<A NAME="376"></A>end and hunt out the inhabitants. In like manner the Persians took also 
<A NAME="377"></A>the Ionian towns upon the mainland, not however netting the inhabitants, 
<A NAME="378"></A>as it was not possible.
<A NAME="379"></A><BR><BR>And now their generals made good all the threats wherewith they 
<A NAME="380"></A>had menaced the Ionians before the battle. For no sooner did they get possession 
<A NAME="381"></A>of the towns than they choose out all the best favoured boys and made them 
<A NAME="382"></A>eunuchs, while the most beautiful of the girls they tore from their homes 
<A NAME="383"></A>and sent as presents to the king, at the same time burning the cities themselves, 
<A NAME="384"></A>with their temples. Thus were the Ionians for the third time reduced to 
<A NAME="385"></A>slavery; once by the Lydians, and a second, and now a third time, by the 
<A NAME="386"></A>Persians.
<A NAME="387"></A><BR><BR>The sea force, after quitting Ionia, proceeded to the Hellespont, 
<A NAME="388"></A>and took all the towns which lie on the left shore as one sails into the 
<A NAME="389"></A>straits. For the cities on the right bank had already been reduced by the 
<A NAME="390"></A>land force of the Persians. Now these are the places which border the Hellespont 
<A NAME="391"></A>on the European side; the Chersonese, which contains a number of cities, 
<A NAME="392"></A>Perinthus, the forts in Thrace, Selybria, and Byzantium. The Byzantines 
<A NAME="393"></A>at this time, and their opposite neighbours, the Chalcedonians, instead 
<A NAME="394"></A>of awaiting the coming of the Phoenicians, quitted their country, and sailing 
<A NAME="395"></A>into the Euxine, took up their abode at the city of Mesembria. The Phoenicians, 
<A NAME="396"></A>after burning all the places above mentioned, proceeded to Proconnresus 
<A NAME="397"></A>and Artaca, which they likewise delivered to the flames; this done, they 
<A NAME="398"></A>returned to the Chersonese, being minded to reduce those cities which they 
<A NAME="399"></A>had not ravaged in their former cruise. Upon Cyzicus they made no attack 
<A NAME="400"></A>at all, as before their coming the inhabitants had made terms with Oebares, 
<A NAME="401"></A>the son of Megabazus, and satrap of Dascyleium, and had submitted themselves 
<A NAME="402"></A>to the king. In the Chersonese the Phoenicians subdued all the cities, 
<A NAME="403"></A>excepting Cardia.
<A NAME="404"></A><BR><BR>Up to this time the cities of the Chersonese had been under the 
<A NAME="405"></A>government of Miltiades, the son of Cimon, and grandson of Stesagoras, 
<A NAME="406"></A>to whom they had descended from Miltiades, the son of Cypselus, who obtained 
<A NAME="407"></A>possession of them in the following manner. The Dolonci, a Thracian tribe, 
<A NAME="408"></A>to whom the Chersonese at that time belonged, being harassed by a war in 
<A NAME="409"></A>which they were engaged with the Apsinthians, sent their princes to Delphi 
<A NAME="410"></A>to consult the oracle about the matter. The reply of the Pythoness bade 
<A NAME="411"></A>them "take back with them as a colonist into their country the man who 
<A NAME="412"></A>should first offer them hospitality after they quitted the temple." The 
<A NAME="413"></A>Dolonci, following the Sacred Road, passed through the regions of Phocis 
<A NAME="414"></A>and Boeotia; after which, as still no one invited them in, they turned 
<A NAME="415"></A>aside, and travelled to Athens.
<A NAME="416"></A><BR><BR>Now Pisistratus was at this time sole lord of Athens; but Miltiades, 
<A NAME="417"></A>the son of Cypselus, was likewise a person of much distinction. He belonged 
<A NAME="418"></A>to a family which was wont to contend in the four-horse-chariot races, 
<A NAME="419"></A>and traced its descent to Aeacus and Egina, but which, from the time of 
<A NAME="420"></A>Philaeas, the son of Ajax, who was the first Athenian citizen of the house, 
<A NAME="421"></A>had been naturalised at Athens. It happened that as the Dolonci passed 
<A NAME="422"></A>his door Miltiades was sitting in his vestibule, which caused him to remark 
<A NAME="423"></A>them, dressed as they were in outlandish garments, and armed moreover with 
<A NAME="424"></A>lances. He therefore called to them, and, on their approach, invited them 
<A NAME="425"></A>in, offering them lodging and entertainment. The strangers accepted his 
<A NAME="426"></A>hospitality, and, after the banquet was over, they laid before him in full 
<A NAME="427"></A>the directions of the oracle and besought him on their own part to yield 
<A NAME="428"></A>obedience to the god. Miltiades was persuaded ere they had done speaking; 
<A NAME="429"></A>for the government of Pisistratus was irksome to him, and he wanted to 
<A NAME="430"></A>be beyond the tyrant's reach. He therefore went straightway to Delphi, 
<A NAME="431"></A>and inquired of the oracle whether he should do as the Dolonci 
<A NAME="432"></A>desired.
<A NAME="433"></A><BR><BR>As the Pythoness backed their request, Miltiades, son of Cypselus 
<A NAME="434"></A>who had already won the four-horse chariot-race at Olympia, left Athens, 
<A NAME="435"></A>taking with him as many of the Athenians as liked to join in the enterprise, 
<A NAME="436"></A>and sailed away with the Dolonci. On his arrival at the Chersonese, he 
<A NAME="437"></A>was made king by those who had invited him. After this his first act was 
<A NAME="438"></A>to build a wall across the neck of the Chersonese from the city of Cardia 
<A NAME="439"></A>to Pactya, to protect the country from the incursions and ravages of the 
<A NAME="440"></A>Apsinthians. The breadth of the isthmus at this part is thirty-six furlongs, 
<A NAME="441"></A>the whole length of the peninsula within the isthmus being four hundred 
<A NAME="442"></A>and twenty furlongs.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR><BR>When he had finished carrying the wall across the isthmus, and 
<A NAME="444"></A>had thus secured the Chersonese against the Apsinthians, Miltiades proceeded 
<A NAME="445"></A>to engage in other wars, and first of all attacked the Lampsacenians; but 
<A NAME="446"></A>falling into an ambush which they had laid he had the misfortune to be 
<A NAME="447"></A>taken prisoner. Now it happened that Miltiades stood high in the favour 
<A NAME="448"></A>of Croesus, king of Lydia. When Croesus therefore heard of his calamity, 
<A NAME="449"></A>he sent and commanded the men of Lampsacus to give Miltiades his freedom; 
<A NAME="450"></A>"if they refused," he said, "he would destroy them like a fir." Then the 
<A NAME="451"></A>Lampsacenians were somewhile in doubt about this speech of Croesus, and 
<A NAME="452"></A>could not tell how to construe his threat "that he would destroy them like 
<A NAME="453"></A>a fir"; but at last one of their elders divined the true sense, and told 
<A NAME="454"></A>them that the fir is the only tree which, when cut down, makes no fresh 
<A NAME="455"></A>shoots, but forthwith dies outright. So the Lampsacenians, being greatly 
<A NAME="456"></A>afraid of Croesus, released Miltiades, and let him go 
<A NAME="457"></A>free.
<A NAME="458"></A><BR><BR>Thus did Miltiades, by the help of Croesus, escape this danger. 
<A NAME="459"></A>Some time afterwards he died childless, leaving his kingdom and his riches 
<A NAME="460"></A>to Stesagoras, who was the son of Cimon, his half-brother. Ever since his 
<A NAME="461"></A>death the people of the Chersonese have offered him the customary sacrifices 
<A NAME="462"></A>of a founder; and they have further established in his honour a gymnic 
<A NAME="463"></A>contest and a chariot-race, in neither of which is it lawful for any Lampsacenian 
<A NAME="464"></A>to contend. Before the war with Lampsacus was ended Stesagoras too died 
<A NAME="465"></A>childless: he was sitting in the hall of justice when he was struck upon 
<A NAME="466"></A>the head with a hatchet by a man who pretended to be a deserter, but was 
<A NAME="467"></A>in good sooth an enemy, and a bitter one.
<A NAME="468"></A><BR><BR>Thus died Stesagoras; and upon his death the Pisistratidae fitted 
<A NAME="469"></A>out a trireme, and sent Miltiades, the son of Cimon, and brother of the 
<A NAME="470"></A>deceased, to the Chersonese, that he might undertake the management of 
<A NAME="471"></A>affairs in that quarter. They had already shown him much favour at Athens, 
<A NAME="472"></A>as if, forsooth, they had been no parties to the death of his father Cimon- 
<A NAME="473"></A>a matter whereof I will give an account in another place. He upon his arrival 
<A NAME="474"></A>remained shut up within the house, pretending to do honour to the memory 
<A NAME="475"></A>of his dead brother; whereupon the chief people of the Chersonese gathered 
<A NAME="476"></A>themselves together from all the cities of the land, and came in a procession 
<A NAME="477"></A>to the place where Miltiades was, to condole with him upon his misfortune. 
<A NAME="478"></A>Miltiades commanded them to be seized and thrown into prison; after which 
<A NAME="479"></A>he made himself master of the Chersonese, maintained a body of five hundred 
<A NAME="480"></A>mercenaries, and married Hegesipyla, daughter of the Thracian king 
<A NAME="481"></A>Olorus.
<A NAME="482"></A><BR><BR>This Miltiades, the son of Cimon, had not been long in the country 
<A NAME="483"></A>when a calamity befell him yet more grievous than those in which he was 
<A NAME="484"></A>now involved: for three years earlier he had had to fly before an incursion 
<A NAME="485"></A>of the Scyths. These nomads, angered by the attack of Darius, collected 
<A NAME="486"></A>in a body and marched as far as the Chersonese. Miltiades did not await 
<A NAME="487"></A>their coming, but fled, and remained away until the Scyths retired, when 
<A NAME="488"></A>the Dolonci sent and fetched him back. All this happened three years before 
<A NAME="489"></A>the events which befell Miltiades at the present time.
<A NAME="490"></A><BR><BR>He now no sooner heard that the Phoenicians were attacking Tenedos 
<A NAME="491"></A>than he loaded five triremes with his goods and chattels, and set sail 
<A NAME="492"></A>for Athens. Cardia was the point from which he took his departure; and 
<A NAME="493"></A>as he sailed down the gulf of Melas, along the shore of the Chersonese, 
<A NAME="494"></A>he came suddenly upon the whole Phoenician fleet. However he himself escaped, 
<A NAME="495"></A>with four of his vessels, and got into Imbrus, one trireme only falling 
<A NAME="496"></A>into the hands of his pursuers. This vessel was under the command of his 
<A NAME="497"></A>eldest son Metiochus, whose mother was not the daughter of the Thracian 
<A NAME="498"></A>king Olorus, but a different woman. Metiochus and his ship were taken; 
<A NAME="499"></A>and when the Phoenicians found out that he was a son of Miltiades they 
<A NAME="500"></A>resolved to convey him to the king, expecting thereby to rise high in the 
<A NAME="501"></A>royal favour. For they remembered that it was Miltiades who counselled 
<A NAME="502"></A>the Ionians to hearken when the Scyths prayed them to break up the bridge 
<A NAME="503"></A>and return home. Darius, however, when the Phoenicians brought Metiochus 
<A NAME="504"></A>into his presence, was so far from doing him any hurt, that he loaded him 
<A NAME="505"></A>with benefits. He gave him a house and estate, and also a Persian wife, 
<A NAME="506"></A>by whom there were children born to him who were accounted Persians. As 
<A NAME="507"></A>for Miltiades himself, from Imbrus he made his way in safety to 
<A NAME="508"></A>Athens.
<A NAME="509"></A><BR><BR>At this time the Persians did no more hurt to the Ionians; but 
<A NAME="510"></A>on the contrary, before the year was out, they carried into effect the 
<A NAME="511"></A>following measures, which were greatly to their advantage. Artaphernes, 
<A NAME="512"></A>satrap of Sardis, summoned deputies from all the Ionian cities, and forced 
<A NAME="513"></A>them to enter into agreements with one another, not to harass each other 
<A NAME="514"></A>by force of arms, but to settle their disputes by reference. He likewise 
<A NAME="515"></A>took the measurement of their whole country in parasangs- such is the name 
<A NAME="516"></A>which the Persians give to a distance of thirty furlongs- and settled the 
<A NAME="517"></A>tributes which the several cities were to pay, at a rate that has continued 
<A NAME="518"></A>unaltered from the time when Artaphernes fixed it down to the present day. 
<A NAME="519"></A>The rate was very nearly the same as that which had been paid before the 
<A NAME="520"></A>revolt. Such were the peaceful dealings of the Persians with the 
<A NAME="521"></A>Ionians.
<A NAME="522"></A><BR><BR>The next spring Darius superseded all the other generals, and sent 
<A NAME="523"></A>down Mardonius, the son of Gobryas, to the coast, and with him a vast body 
<A NAME="524"></A>of men, some fit for sea, others for land service. Mardonius was a youth 
<A NAME="525"></A>at this time, and had only lately married Artazostra, the king's daughter. 
<A NAME="526"></A>When Mardonius, accompanied by this numerous host, reached Cilicia, he 
<A NAME="527"></A>took ship and proceeded along shore with his fleet, while the land army 
<A NAME="528"></A>marched under other leaders towards the Hellespont. In the course of his 
<A NAME="529"></A>voyage along the coast of Asia he came to Ionia; and here I have a marvel 
<A NAME="530"></A>to relate which will greatly surprise those Greeks who cannot believe that 
<A NAME="531"></A>Otanes advised the seven conspirators to make Persia a commonwealth. Mardonius 
<A NAME="532"></A>put down all the despots throughout Ionia, and in lieu of them established 
<A NAME="533"></A>democracies. Having so done, he hastened to the Hellespont, and when a 
<A NAME="534"></A>vast multitude of ships had been brought together, and likewise a powerful 
<A NAME="535"></A>land force, he conveyed his troops across the strait by means of his vessels, 
<A NAME="536"></A>and proceeded through Europe against Eretria and Athens.
<A NAME="537"></A><BR><BR>At least these towns served as a pretext for the expedition, the 
<A NAME="538"></A>real purpose of which was to subjugate as great a number as possible of 
<A NAME="539"></A>the Grecian cities; and this became plain when the Thasians, who did not 
<A NAME="540"></A>even lift a hand in their defence, were reduced by the sea force, while 
<A NAME="541"></A>the land army added the Macedonians to the former slaves of the king. All 
<A NAME="542"></A>the tribes on the hither side of Macedonia had been reduced previously. 
<A NAME="543"></A>From Thasos the fleet stood across to the mainland, and sailed along shore 
<A NAME="544"></A>to Acanthus, whence an attempt was made to double Mount Athos. But here 
<A NAME="545"></A>a violent north wind sprang up, against which nothing could contend, and 
<A NAME="546"></A>handled a large number of the ships with much rudeness, shattering them 
<A NAME="547"></A>and driving them aground upon Athos. 'Tis said the number of the ships 
<A NAME="548"></A>destroyed was little short of three hundred; and the men who perished were 
<A NAME="549"></A>more than twenty thousand. For the sea about Athos abounds in monsters 
<A NAME="550"></A>beyond all others; and so a portion were seized and devoured by these animals, 
<A NAME="551"></A>while others were dashed violently against the rocks; some, who did not 
<A NAME="552"></A>know how to swim, were engulfed; and some died of the 
<A NAME="553"></A>cold.
<A NAME="554"></A><BR><BR>While thus it fared with the fleet, on land Mardonius and his army 
<A NAME="555"></A>were attacked in their camp during the night by the Brygi, a tribe of Thracians; 
<A NAME="556"></A>and here vast numbers of the Persians were slain, and even Mardonius himself 
<A NAME="557"></A>received a wound. The Brygi, nevertheless, did not succeed in maintaining 
<A NAME="558"></A>their own freedom: for Mardonius would not leave the country till he had 
<A NAME="559"></A>subdued them and made them subjects of Persia. Still, though he brought 
<A NAME="560"></A>them under the yoke, the blow which his land force had received at their 
<A NAME="561"></A>hands, and the great damage done to his fleet off Athos, induced him to 
<A NAME="562"></A>set out upon his retreat; and so this armament, having failed disgracefully, 
<A NAME="563"></A>returned to Asia.
<A NAME="564"></A><BR><BR>The year after these events, Darius received information from certain 
<A NAME="565"></A>neighbours of the Thasians that those islanders were making preparations 
<A NAME="566"></A>for revolt; he therefore sent a herald, and bade them dismantle their walls, 
<A NAME="567"></A>and bring all their ships to Abdera. The Thasians, at the time when Histiaeus 
<A NAME="568"></A>the Milesian made his attack upon them, had resolved that, as their income 
<A NAME="569"></A>was very great, they would apply their wealth to building ships of war, 
<A NAME="570"></A>and surrounding their city with another and a stronger wall. Their revenue 
<A NAME="571"></A>was derived partly from their possessions upon the mainland, partly from 
<A NAME="572"></A>the mines which they owned. They were masters of the gold mines at Scapte-Hyle, 
<A NAME="573"></A>the yearly produce of which amounted in all to eighty talents. Their mines 
<A NAME="574"></A>in Thasos yielded less, but still were so far prolific that, besides being 
<A NAME="575"></A>entirely free from land-tax, they had a surplus income, derived from the 
<A NAME="576"></A>two sources of their territory on the main and their mines, in common years 
<A NAME="577"></A>of two hundred, and in the best years of three hundred 
<A NAME="578"></A>talents.
<A NAME="579"></A><BR><BR>I myself have seen the mines in question: by far the most curious 
<A NAME="580"></A>of them are those which the Phoenicians discovered at the time when they 
<A NAME="581"></A>went with Thasus and colonised the island, which afterwards took its name 
<A NAME="582"></A>from him. These Phoenician workings are in Thasos itself, between Coenyra 
<A NAME="583"></A>and a place called Aenyra, over against Samothrace: a huge mountain has 
<A NAME="584"></A>been turned upside down in the search for ores. Such then was the source 
<A NAME="585"></A>of their wealth. On this occasion no sooner did the Great King issue his 
<A NAME="586"></A>commands than straightway the Thasians dismantled their wall, and took 
<A NAME="587"></A>their whole fleet to Abdera.
<A NAME="588"></A><BR><BR>After this Darius resolved to prove the Greeks, and try the bent 
<A NAME="589"></A>of their minds, whether they were inclined to resist him in arms or prepared 
<A NAME="590"></A>to make their submission. He therefore sent out heralds in divers directions 
<A NAME="591"></A>round about Greece, with orders to demand everywhere earth and water for 
<A NAME="592"></A>the king. At the same time he sent other heralds to the various seaport 
<A NAME="593"></A>towns which paid him tribute, and required them to provide a number of 
<A NAME="594"></A>ships of war and horse-transports.
<A NAME="595"></A><BR><BR>These towns accordingly began their preparations; and the heralds 
<A NAME="596"></A>who had been sent into Greece obtained what the king had bid them ask from 
<A NAME="597"></A>a large number of the states upon the mainland, and likewise from all the 
<A NAME="598"></A>islanders whom they visited. Among these last were included the Eginetans, 
<A NAME="599"></A>who, equally with the rest, consented to give earth and water to the Persian 
<A NAME="600"></A>king.
<A NAME="601"></A><BR><BR>When the Athenians heard what the Eginetans had done, believing 
<A NAME="602"></A>that it was from enmity to themselves that they had given consent, and 
<A NAME="603"></A>that the Eginetans intended to join the Persian in his attack upon Athens, 
<A NAME="604"></A>they straightway took the matter in hand. In good truth it greatly rejoiced 
<A NAME="605"></A>them to have so fair a pretext; and accordingly they sent frequent embassies 
<A NAME="606"></A>to Sparta, and made it a charge against the Eginetans that their conduct 
<A NAME="607"></A>in this matter proved them to be traitors to Greece.
<A NAME="608"></A><BR><BR>Hereupon Cleomenes, the son of Anaxandridas, who was then king 
<A NAME="609"></A>of the Spartans, went in person to Egina, intending to seize those whose 
<A NAME="610"></A>guilt was the greatest. As soon however as he tried to arrest them, a number 
<A NAME="611"></A>of the Eginetins made resistance; a certain Crius, son of Polycritus, being 
<A NAME="612"></A>the foremost in violence. This person told him "he should not carry off 
<A NAME="613"></A>a single Eginetan without it costing him dear- the Athenians had bribed 
<A NAME="614"></A>him to make this attack, for which he had no warrant from his own government- 
<A NAME="615"></A>otherwise both the kings would have come together to make the seizure." 
<A NAME="616"></A>This he said in consequence of instructions which he had received from 
<A NAME="617"></A>Demaratus. Hereupon Cleomenes, finding that he must quit Egina, asked Crius 
<A NAME="618"></A>his name; and when Crius told him, "Get thy horns tipped with brass with 
<A NAME="619"></A>all speed, O Crius!" he said, "for thou wilt have to struggle with a great 
<A NAME="620"></A>danger."
<A NAME="621"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile Demaratus, son of Ariston, was bringing charges against 
<A NAME="622"></A>Cleomenes at Sparta. He too, like Cleomenes, was king of the Spartans, 
<A NAME="623"></A>but he belonged to the lower house- not indeed that his house was of any 
<A NAME="624"></A>lower origin than the other, for both houses are of one blood- but the 
<A NAME="625"></A>house of Eurysthenes is the more honoured of the two, inasmuch as it is 
<A NAME="626"></A>the elder branch.
<A NAME="627"></A><BR><BR>The Lacedaemonians declare, contradicting therein all the poets, 
<A NAME="628"></A>that it was king Aristodemus himself, son of Aristomachus, grandson of 
<A NAME="629"></A>Cleodaeus, and great-grandson of Hyllus, who conducted them to the land 
<A NAME="630"></A>which they now possess, and not the sons of Aristodemus. The wife of Aristodemus, 
<A NAME="631"></A>whose name (they say) was Argeia, and who was daughter of Autesion, son 
<A NAME="632"></A>of Tisamenus, grandson of Thersander, and great-grandson of Polynices, 
<A NAME="633"></A>within a little while after their coming into the country, gave birth to 
<A NAME="634"></A>twins. Aristodemus just lived to see his children, but died soon afterwards 
<A NAME="635"></A>of a disease. The Lacedaemonians of that day determined, according to custom, 
<A NAME="636"></A>to take for their king the elder of the two children; but they were so 
<A NAME="637"></A>alike, and so exactly of one size, that they could not possibly tell which 
<A NAME="638"></A>of the two to choose: so when they found themselves unable to make a choice, 
<A NAME="639"></A>or haply even earlier, they went to the mother and asked her to tell them 
<A NAME="640"></A>which was the elder, whereupon she declared that "she herself did not know 
<A NAME="641"></A>the children apart"; although in good truth she knew them very well, and 
<A NAME="642"></A>only feigned ignorance in order that, if it were possible, both of them 
<A NAME="643"></A>might be made kings of Sparta. The Lacedaemonians were now in a great strait; 
<A NAME="644"></A>so they sent to Delphi and inquired of the oracle how they should deal 
<A NAME="645"></A>with the matter. The Pythoness made answer, "Let both be taken to be kings; 
<A NAME="646"></A>but let the elder have the greater honour." So the Lacedaemonians were 
<A NAME="647"></A>in as great a strait as before, and could not conceive how they were to 
<A NAME="648"></A>discover which was the first-born, till at length a certain Messenian, 
<A NAME="649"></A>by name Panites, suggested to them to watch and see which of the two the 
<A NAME="650"></A>mother washed and fed first; if they found she always gave one the preference, 
<A NAME="651"></A>that fact would tell them all they wanted to know; if, on the contrary, 
<A NAME="652"></A>she herself varied, and sometimes took the one first, sometimes the other, 
<A NAME="653"></A>it would be plain that she knew as little as they; in which case they must 
<A NAME="654"></A>try some other plan. The Lacedaemonians did according to the advice of 
<A NAME="655"></A>the Messenian, and, without letting her know why, kept a watch upon the 
<A NAME="656"></A>mother; by which means they discovered that, whenever she either washed 
<A NAME="657"></A>or fed her children, she always gave the same child the preference. So 
<A NAME="658"></A>they took the boy whom the mother honoured the most, and regarding him 
<A NAME="659"></A>as the first-born, brought him up in the palace; and the name which they 
<A NAME="660"></A>gave to the elder boy was Eurysthenes, while his brother they called Procles. 
<A NAME="661"></A>When the brothers grew up, there was always, so long as they lived, enmity 
<A NAME="662"></A>between them; and the houses sprung from their loins have continued the 
<A NAME="663"></A>feud to this day.
<A NAME="664"></A><BR><BR>Thus much is related by the Lacedaemonians, but not by any of the 
<A NAME="665"></A>other Greeks; in what follows I give the tradition of the Greeks generally. 
<A NAME="666"></A>The kings of the Dorians (they say)- counting up to Perseus, son of Danae, 
<A NAME="667"></A>and so omitting the god- are rightly given in the common Greek lists, and 
<A NAME="668"></A>rightly considered to have been Greeks themselves; for even at this early 
<A NAME="669"></A>time they ranked among that people. I say "up to Perseus," and not further, 
<A NAME="670"></A>because Perseus has no mortal father by whose name he is called, as Hercules 
<A NAME="671"></A>has in Amphitryon; whereby it appears that I have reason on my side, and 
<A NAME="672"></A>am right in saying, "up to Perseus." If we follow the line of Danad, daughter 
<A NAME="673"></A>of Acrisius, and trace her progenitors, we shall find that the chiefs of 
<A NAME="674"></A>the Dorians are really genuine Egyptians. In the genealogies here given 
<A NAME="675"></A>I have followed the common Greek accounts.
<A NAME="676"></A><BR><BR>According to the Persian story, Perseus was an Assyrian who became 
<A NAME="677"></A>a Greek; his ancestors, therefore, according to them, were not Greeks. 
<A NAME="678"></A>They do not admit that the forefathers of Acrisius were in any way related 
<A NAME="679"></A>to Perseus, but say they were Egyptians, as the Greeks likewise 
<A NAME="680"></A>testify.
<A NAME="681"></A><BR><BR>Enough however of this subject. How it came to pass that Egyptians 
<A NAME="682"></A>obtained the kingdoms of the Dorians, and what they did to raise themselves 
<A NAME="683"></A>to such a position, these are questions concerning which, as they have 
<A NAME="684"></A>been treated by others, I shall say nothing. I proceed to speak of points 
<A NAME="685"></A>on which no other writer has touched.
<A NAME="686"></A><BR><BR>The prerogatives which the Spartans have allowed their kings are 
<A NAME="687"></A>the following. In the first place, two priesthoods, those (namely) of Lacedaemonian 
<A NAME="688"></A>and of Celestial Jupiter; also the right of making war on what country 
<A NAME="689"></A>soever they please, without hindrance from any of the other Spartans, under 
<A NAME="690"></A>pain of outlawry; on service the privilege of marching first in the advance 
<A NAME="691"></A>and last in the retreat, and of having a hundred picked men for their body 
<A NAME="692"></A>guard while with the army; likewise the liberty of sacrificing as many 
<A NAME="693"></A>cattle in their expeditions as it seems them good, and the right of having 
<A NAME="694"></A>the skins and the chines of the slaughtered animals for their own 
<A NAME="695"></A>use.
<A NAME="696"></A><BR><BR>Such are their privileges in war; in peace their rights are as 
<A NAME="697"></A>follows. When a citizen makes a public sacrifice the kings are given the 
<A NAME="698"></A>first seats at the banquet; they are served before any of the other guests, 
<A NAME="699"></A>and have a double portion of everything; they take the lead in the libations; 
<A NAME="700"></A>and the hides of the sacrificed beasts belong to them. Every month, on 
<A NAME="701"></A>the first day, and again on the seventh of the first decade, each king 
<A NAME="702"></A>receives a beast without blemish at the public cost, which he offers up 
<A NAME="703"></A>to Apollo; likewise a medimnus of meal, and of wine a Laconian quart. In 
<A NAME="704"></A>the contests of the Games they have always the seat of honour; they appoint 
<A NAME="705"></A>the citizens who have to entertain foreigners; they also nominate, each 
<A NAME="706"></A>of them, two of the Pythians, officers whose business it is to consult 
<A NAME="707"></A>the oracle at Delphi, who eat with the kings, and, like them, live at the 
<A NAME="708"></A>public charge. If the kings do not come to the public supper, each of them 
<A NAME="709"></A>must have two choenixes of meal and a cotyle of wine sent home to him at 
<A NAME="710"></A>his house; if they come, they are given a double quantity of each, and 
<A NAME="711"></A>the same when any private man invites them to his table. They have the 
<A NAME="712"></A>custody of all the oracles which are pronounced; but the Pythians must 
<A NAME="713"></A>likewise have knowledge of them. They have the whole decision of certain 
<A NAME="714"></A>causes, which are these, and these only:- When a maiden is left the heiress 
<A NAME="715"></A>of her father's estate, and has not been betrothed by him to any one, they 
<A NAME="716"></A>decide who is to marry her; in all matters concerning the public highways 
<A NAME="717"></A>they judge; and if a person wants to adopt a child, he must do it before 
<A NAME="718"></A>the kings. They likewise have the right of sitting in council with the 
<A NAME="719"></A>eight-and-twenty senators; and if they are not present, then the senators 
<A NAME="720"></A>nearest of kin to them have their privileges, and give two votes as the 
<A NAME="721"></A>royal proxies, besides a third vote, which is their 
<A NAME="722"></A>own.
<A NAME="723"></A><BR><BR>Such are the honours which the Spartan people have allowed their 
<A NAME="724"></A>kings during their lifetime; after they are dead other honours await them. 
<A NAME="725"></A>Horsemen carry the news of their death through all Laconia, while in the 
<A NAME="726"></A>city the women go hither and thither drumming upon a kettle. At this signal, 
<A NAME="727"></A>in every house two free persons, a man and a woman, must put on mourning, 
<A NAME="728"></A>or else be subject to a heavy fine. The Lacedaemonians have likewise a 
<A NAME="729"></A>custom at the demise of their kings which is common to them with the barbarians 
<A NAME="730"></A>of Asia- indeed with the greater number of the barbarians everywhere- namely, 
<A NAME="731"></A>that when one of their kings dies, not only the Spartans, but a certain 
<A NAME="732"></A>number of the country people from every part of Laconia are forced, whether 
<A NAME="733"></A>they will or no, to attend the funeral. So these persons and the helots, 
<A NAME="734"></A>and likewise the Spartans themselves, flock together to the number of several 
<A NAME="735"></A>thousands, men and women intermingled; and all of them smite their foreheads 
<A NAME="736"></A>violently, and weep and wall without stint, saying always that their last 
<A NAME="737"></A>king was the best. If a king dies in battle, then they make a statue of 
<A NAME="738"></A>him, and placing it upon a couch right bravely decked, so carry it to the 
<A NAME="739"></A>grave. After the burial, by the space of ten days there is no assembly, 
<A NAME="740"></A>nor do they elect magistrates, but continue mourning the whole 
<A NAME="741"></A>time.
<A NAME="742"></A><BR><BR>They hold with the Persians also in another custom. When a king 
<A NAME="743"></A>dies, and another comes to the throne, the newly-made monarch forgives 
<A NAME="744"></A>all the Spartans the debts which they owe either to the king or to the 
<A NAME="745"></A>public treasury. And in like manner among the Persians each king when he 
<A NAME="746"></A>begins to reign remits the tribute due from the provinces.
<A NAME="747"></A><BR><BR>In one respect the Lacedaemonians resemble the Egyptians. Their 
<A NAME="748"></A>heralds and flute-players, and likewise their cooks, take their trades 
<A NAME="749"></A>by succession from their fathers. A flute-player must be the son of a flute-player, 
<A NAME="750"></A>a cook of a cook, a herald of a herald; and other people cannot take advantage 
<A NAME="751"></A>of the loudness of their voice to come into the profession and shut out 
<A NAME="752"></A>the heralds' sons; but each follows his father's business. Such are the 
<A NAME="753"></A>customs of the Lacedaemonians.
<A NAME="754"></A><BR><BR>At the time of which we are speaking, while Cleomenes in Egina 
<A NAME="755"></A>was labouring for the general good of Greece, Demaratus at Sparta continued 
<A NAME="756"></A>to bring charges against him, moved not so much by love of the Eginetans 
<A NAME="757"></A>as by jealousy and hatred of his colleague. Cleomenes therefore was no 
<A NAME="758"></A>sooner returned from Egina than he considered with himself how he might 
<A NAME="759"></A>deprive Demaratus of his kingly office; and here the following circumstance 
<A NAME="760"></A>furnished a ground for him to proceed upon. Ariston, king of Sparta, had 
<A NAME="761"></A>been married to two wives, but neither of them had borne him any children; 
<A NAME="762"></A>as however he still thought it was possible he might have offspring, he 
<A NAME="763"></A>resolved to wed a third; and this was how the wedding was brought about. 
<A NAME="764"></A>He had a certain friend, a Spartan, with whom he was more intimate than 
<A NAME="765"></A>with any other citizen. This friend was married to a wife whose beauty 
<A NAME="766"></A>far surpassed that of all the other women in Sparta; and what was still 
<A NAME="767"></A>more strange, she had once been as ugly as she now was beautiful. For her 
<A NAME="768"></A>nurse, seeing how ill-favoured she was, and how sadly her parents, who 
<A NAME="769"></A>were wealthy people, took her bad looks to heart, bethought herself of 
<A NAME="770"></A>a plan, which was to carry the child every day to the temple of Helen at 
<A NAME="771"></A>Therapna, which stands above the Phoebeum, and there to place her before 
<A NAME="772"></A>the image, and beseech the goddess to take away the child's ugliness. One 
<A NAME="773"></A>day, as she left the temple, a woman appeared to her, and begged to know 
<A NAME="774"></A>what it was she held in her arms. The nurse told her it was a child, on 
<A NAME="775"></A>which she asked to see it; but the nurse refused; the parents, she said, 
<A NAME="776"></A>had forbidden her to show the child to any one. However the woman would 
<A NAME="777"></A>not take a denial; and the nurse, seeing how highly she prized a look, 
<A NAME="778"></A>at last let her see the child. Then the woman gently stroked its head, 
<A NAME="779"></A>and said, "One day this child shall be the fairest dame in Sparta." And 
<A NAME="780"></A>her looks began to change from that very day. When she was of marriageable 
<A NAME="781"></A>age, Agetus, son of Alcides, the same whom I have mentioned above as the 
<A NAME="782"></A>friend of Ariston, made her his wife.
<A NAME="783"></A><BR><BR>Now it chanced that Ariston fell in love with this person; and 
<A NAME="784"></A>his love so preyed upon his mind that at last he devised as follows. He 
<A NAME="785"></A>went to his friend, the lady's husband, and proposed to him that they should 
<A NAME="786"></A>exchange gifts, each taking that which pleased him best out of all the 
<A NAME="787"></A>possessions of the other. His friend, who felt no alarm about his wife, 
<A NAME="788"></A>since Ariston was also married, consented readily; and so the matter was 
<A NAME="789"></A>confirmed between them by an oath. Then Ariston gave Agetus the present, 
<A NAME="790"></A>whatever it was, of which he had made choice, and when it came to his turn 
<A NAME="791"></A>to name the present which he was to receive in exchange, required to be 
<A NAME="792"></A>allowed to carry home with him Agetus's wife. But the other demurred, and 
<A NAME="793"></A>said, "except his wife, he might have anything else": however, as he could 
<A NAME="794"></A>not resist the oath which he had sworn, or the trickery which had been 
<A NAME="795"></A>practised on him, at last he suffered Ariston to carry her away to his 
<A NAME="796"></A>house.
<A NAME="797"></A><BR><BR>Ariston hereupon put away his second wife and took for his third 
<A NAME="798"></A>this woman; and she, in less than the due time- when she had not yet reached 
<A NAME="799"></A>her full term of ten months- gave birth to a child, the Demaratus of whom 
<A NAME="800"></A>we have spoken. Then one of his servants came and told him the news, as 
<A NAME="801"></A>he sat in council with the Ephors; whereat, remembering when it was that 
<A NAME="802"></A>the woman became his wife, he counted the months upon his fingers, and 
<A NAME="803"></A>having so done, cried out with an oath, "The boy cannot be mine." This 
<A NAME="804"></A>was said in the hearing of the Ephors; but they made no account of it at 
<A NAME="805"></A>the time. The boy grew up; and Ariston repented of what he had said; for 
<A NAME="806"></A>he became altogether convinced that Demaratus was truly his son. The reason 
<A NAME="807"></A>why he named him Demaratus was the following. Some time before these events 
<A NAME="808"></A>the whole Spartan people, looking upon Ariston as a man of mark beyond 
<A NAME="809"></A>all the kings that had reigned at Sparta before him, had offered up a prayer 
<A NAME="810"></A>that he might have a son. On this account, therefore, the name Demaratus 
<A NAME="811"></A>was given.
<A NAME="812"></A><BR><BR>In course of time Ariston died; and Demaratus received the kingdom: 
<A NAME="813"></A>but it was fated, as it seems, that these words, when bruited abroad, should 
<A NAME="814"></A>strip him of his sovereignty. This was brought about by means of Cleomenes, 
<A NAME="815"></A>whom he had twice sorely vexed, once when he led the army home from Eleusis, 
<A NAME="816"></A>and a second time when Cleomenes was gone across to Egina against such 
<A NAME="817"></A>as had espoused the side of the Medes.
<A NAME="818"></A><BR><BR>Cleomenes now, being resolved to have his revenge upon Demaratus, 
<A NAME="819"></A>went to Leotychides, the son of Menares, and grandson of Agis, who was 
<A NAME="820"></A>of the same family as Demaratus, and made agreement with him to this tenor 
<A NAME="821"></A>following. Cleomenes was to lend his aid to make Leotychides king in the 
<A NAME="822"></A>room of Demaratus; and then Leotychides was to take part with Cleomenes 
<A NAME="823"></A>against the Eginetans. Now Leotychides hated Demaratus chiefly on account 
<A NAME="824"></A>of Percalus, the daughter of Chilon, son of Demarmenus: this lady had been 
<A NAME="825"></A>betrothed to Leotychides; but Demaratus laid a plot, and robbed him of 
<A NAME="826"></A>his bride, forestalling him in carrying her off, and marrying her. Such 
<A NAME="827"></A>was the origin of the enmity. At the time of which we speak, Leotychides 
<A NAME="828"></A>was prevailed upon by the earnest desire of Cleomenes to come forward against 
<A NAME="829"></A>Demaratus and make oath "that Demaratus was not rightful king of Sparta, 
<A NAME="830"></A>since he was not the true son of Ariston." After he had thus sworn, Leotychides 
<A NAME="831"></A>sued Demaratus, and brought up against him the phrase which Ariston had 
<A NAME="832"></A>let drop when, on the coming of his servant to announce to him the birth 
<A NAME="833"></A>of his son, he counted the months, and cried out with an oath that the 
<A NAME="834"></A>child was not his. It was on this speech of Ariston's that Leotychides 
<A NAME="835"></A>relied to prove that Demaratus was not his son, and therefore not rightful 
<A NAME="836"></A>king of Sparta; and he produced as witnesses the Ephors who were sitting 
<A NAME="837"></A>with Ariston at the time and heard what he said.
<A NAME="838"></A><BR><BR>At last, as there came to be much strife concerning this matter, 
<A NAME="839"></A>the Spartans made a decree that the Delphic oracle should be asked to say 
<A NAME="840"></A>whether Demaratus were Ariston's son or no. Cleomenes set them upon this 
<A NAME="841"></A>plan; and no sooner was the decree passed than he made a friend of Cobon, 
<A NAME="842"></A>the son of Aristophantus, a man of the greatest weight among the Delphians; 
<A NAME="843"></A>and this Cobon prevailed upon Perialla, the prophetess, to give the answer 
<A NAME="844"></A>which Cleomenes wished. Accordingly, when the sacred messengers came and 
<A NAME="845"></A>put their question, the Pythoness returned for answer "that Demaratus was 
<A NAME="846"></A>not Ariston's son." Some time afterwards all this became known; and Cobon 
<A NAME="847"></A>was forced to fly from Delphi; while Perialla the prophetess was deprived 
<A NAME="848"></A>of her office.
<A NAME="849"></A><BR><BR>Such were the means whereby the deposition of Demaratus was brought 
<A NAME="850"></A>about; but his flying from Sparta to the Medes was by reason of an affront 
<A NAME="851"></A>which was put upon him. On losing his kingdom he had been made a magistrate; 
<A NAME="852"></A>and in that office soon afterwards, when the feast of the Gymnopaediae 
<A NAME="853"></A>came around, he took his station among the lookers-on; whereupon Leotychides, 
<A NAME="854"></A>who was now king in his room, sent a servant to him and asked him, by way 
<A NAME="855"></A>of insult and mockery, "how it felt to be a magistrate after one had been 
<A NAME="856"></A>a king?" Demaratus, who was hurt at the question, made answer- "Tell him 
<A NAME="857"></A>I have tried them both, but he has not. Howbeit this speech will be the 
<A NAME="858"></A>cause to Sparta of infinite blessings or else of infinite woes." Having 
<A NAME="859"></A>thus spoken he wrapped his head in his robe, and, leaving the theatre, 
<A NAME="860"></A>went home to his own house, where he prepared an ox for sacrifice, and 
<A NAME="861"></A>offered it to Jupiter, after which he called for his 
<A NAME="862"></A>mother.
<A NAME="863"></A><BR><BR>When she appeared, he took of the entrails, and placing them in 
<A NAME="864"></A>her hand, besought her in these words following:-
<A NAME="865"></A><BR><BR>"Dear mother, I beseech you, by all the gods, and chiefly by our 
<A NAME="866"></A>own hearth-god Jupiter, tell me the very truth, who was really my father. 
<A NAME="867"></A>For Leotychides, in the suit which we had together, declared that when 
<A NAME="868"></A>thou becamest Ariston's wife thou didst already bear in thy womb a child 
<A NAME="869"></A>by thy former husband, and others repeat a yet more disgraceful tale, that 
<A NAME="870"></A>our groom found favour in thine eyes, and that I am his son. I entreat 
<A NAME="871"></A>thee therefore by the gods to tell me the truth. For if thou hast gone 
<A NAME="872"></A>astray, thou hast done no more than many a woman; and the Spartans remark 
<A NAME="873"></A>it as strange, if I am Ariston's son, that he had no children by his other 
<A NAME="874"></A>wives."
<A NAME="875"></A><BR><BR>Thus spake Demaratus; and his mother replied as follows: "Dear 
<A NAME="876"></A>son, since thou entreatest so earnestly for the truth, it shall indeed 
<A NAME="877"></A>be fully told to thee. When Ariston brought me to his house, on the third 
<A NAME="878"></A>night after my coming, there appeared to me one like to Ariston, who, after 
<A NAME="879"></A>staying with me a while, rose, and taking the garlands from his own brows 
<A NAME="880"></A>placed them upon my head, and so went away. Presently after Ariston entered, 
<A NAME="881"></A>and when he saw the garlands which I still wore, asked me who gave them 
<A NAME="882"></A>to me. I said, 'twas he; but this he stoutly denied; whereupon I solemnly 
<A NAME="883"></A>swore that it was none other, and told him he did not do well to dissemble 
<A NAME="884"></A>when he had so lately risen from my side and left the garlands with me. 
<A NAME="885"></A>Then Ariston, when he heard my oath, understood that there was something 
<A NAME="886"></A>beyond nature in what had taken place. And indeed it appeared that the 
<A NAME="887"></A>garlands had come from the hero-temple which stands by our court gates- 
<A NAME="888"></A>the temple of him they call Astrabacus- and the soothsayers, moreover, 
<A NAME="889"></A>declared that the apparition was that very person. And now, my son, I have 
<A NAME="890"></A>told thee all thou wouldest fain know. Either thou art the son of that 
<A NAME="891"></A>hero- either thou mayest call Astrabacus sire; or else Ariston was thy 
<A NAME="892"></A>father. As for that matter which they who hate thee urge the most, the 
<A NAME="893"></A>words of Ariston, who, when the messenger told him of thy birth, declared 
<A NAME="894"></A>before many witnesses that 'thou wert not his son, forasmuch as the ten 
<A NAME="895"></A>months were not fully out,' it was a random speech, uttered from mere ignorance. 
<A NAME="896"></A>The truth is, children are born not only at ten months, but at nine, and 
<A NAME="897"></A>even at seven. Thou wert thyself, my son, a seven months' child. Ariston 
<A NAME="898"></A>acknowledged, no long time afterwards, that his speech sprang from thoughtlessness. 
<A NAME="899"></A>Hearken not then to other tales concerning thy birth, my son: for be assured 
<A NAME="900"></A>thou hast the whole truth. As for grooms, pray Heaven Leotychides and all 
<A NAME="901"></A>who speak as he does may suffer wrong from them!" Such was the mother's 
<A NAME="902"></A>answer.
<A NAME="903"></A><BR><BR>Demaratus, having learnt all that he wished to know, took with 
<A NAME="904"></A>him provision for the journey, and went into Elis, pretending that he purposed 
<A NAME="905"></A>to proceed to Delphi, and there consult the oracle. The Lacedaemonians, 
<A NAME="906"></A>however, suspecting that he meant to fly his country, sent men in pursuit 
<A NAME="907"></A>of him; but Demaratus hastened, and leaving Elis before they arrived, sailed 
<A NAME="908"></A>across to Zacynthus. The Lacedaemonians followed, and sought to lay hands 
<A NAME="909"></A>upon him, and to separate him from his retinue; but the Zacynthians would 
<A NAME="910"></A>not give him up to them: so he escaping, made his way afterwards by sea 
<A NAME="911"></A>to Asia, and presented himself before King Darius, who received him generously, 
<A NAME="912"></A>and gave him both lands and cities. Such was the chance which drove Demaratus 
<A NAME="913"></A>to Asia, a man distinguished among the Lacedaemonians for many noble deeds 
<A NAME="914"></A>and wise counsels, and who alone of all the Spartan kings brought honour 
<A NAME="915"></A>to his country by winning at Olympia the prize in the four-horse 
<A NAME="916"></A>chariot-race.
<A NAME="917"></A><BR><BR>After Demaratus was deposed, Leotychides, the son of Menares, received 
<A NAME="918"></A>the kingdom. He had a son, Zeuxidamus, called Cyniscus by many of the Spartans. 
<A NAME="919"></A>This Zeuxidamus did not reign at Sparta, but died before his father, leaving 
<A NAME="920"></A>a son, Archidamus. Leotychides, when Zeuxidamus was taken from him, married 
<A NAME="921"></A>a second wife, named Eurydame, the sister of Menius and daughter of Diactorides. 
<A NAME="922"></A>By her he had no male offspring, but only a daughter called Lampito, whom 
<A NAME="923"></A>he gave in marriage to Archidamus, Zeuxidamus' son.
<A NAME="924"></A><BR><BR>Even Leotychides, however, did not spend his old age in Sparta, 
<A NAME="925"></A>but suffered a punishment whereby Demaratus was fully avenged. He commanded 
<A NAME="926"></A>the Lacedaemonians when they made war against Thessaly, and might have 
<A NAME="927"></A>conquered the whole of it, but was bribed by a large sum of money. It chanced 
<A NAME="928"></A>that he was caught in the fact, being found sitting in his tent on a gauntlet, 
<A NAME="929"></A>quite full of silver. Upon this he was brought to trial and banished from 
<A NAME="930"></A>Sparta; his house was razed to the ground; and he himself fled to Tegea, 
<A NAME="931"></A>where he ended his days. But these events took place long 
<A NAME="932"></A>afterwards.
<A NAME="933"></A><BR><BR>At the time of which we are speaking, Cleomenes, having carried 
<A NAME="934"></A>his proceedings in the matter of Demaratus to a prosperous issue, forthwith 
<A NAME="935"></A>took Leotychides with him, and crossed over to attack the Eginetans; for 
<A NAME="936"></A>his anger was hot against them on account of the affront which they had 
<A NAME="937"></A>formerly put upon him. Hereupon the Eginetans, seeing that both the kings 
<A NAME="938"></A>were come against them, thought it best to make no further resistance. 
<A NAME="939"></A>So the two kings picked out from all Egina the ten men who for wealth and 
<A NAME="940"></A>birth stood the highest, among whom were Crius, son of Polycritus, and 
<A NAME="941"></A>Casambus, son of Aristocrates, who wielded the chief power; and these men 
<A NAME="942"></A>they carried with them to Attica, and there deposited them in the hands 
<A NAME="943"></A>of the Athenians, the great enemies of the Eginetans.
<A NAME="944"></A><BR><BR>Afterwards, when it came to be known what evil arts had been used 
<A NAME="945"></A>against Demaratus, Cleomenes was seized with fear of his own countrymen, 
<A NAME="946"></A>and fled into Thessaly. From thence he passed into Arcadia, where he began 
<A NAME="947"></A>to stir up troubles, and endeavoured to unite the Arcadians against Sparta. 
<A NAME="948"></A>He bound them by various oaths to follow him whithersoever he should lead, 
<A NAME="949"></A>and was even desirous of taking their chief leaders with him to the city 
<A NAME="950"></A>of Nonacris, that he might swear them to his cause by the waters of the 
<A NAME="951"></A>Styx. For the waters of Styx, as the Arcadians say, are in that city, and 
<A NAME="952"></A>this is the appearance they present: you see a little water, dripping from 
<A NAME="953"></A>a rock into a basin, which is fenced round by a low wall. Nonacris, where 
<A NAME="954"></A>this fountain is to be seen, is a city of Arcadia near 
<A NAME="955"></A>Pheneus.
<A NAME="956"></A><BR><BR>When the Lacedaemonians heard how Cleomenes was engaged, they were 
<A NAME="957"></A>afraid, and agreed with him that he should come back to Sparta and be king 
<A NAME="958"></A>as before. So Cleomenes came back; but had no sooner returned than he, 
<A NAME="959"></A>who had never been altogether of sound mind, was smitten with downright 
<A NAME="960"></A>madness. This he showed by striking every Spartan he met upon the face 
<A NAME="961"></A>with his sceptre. On his behaving thus, and showing that he was gone quite 
<A NAME="962"></A>out of his mind, his kindred imprisoned him, and even put his feet in the 
<A NAME="963"></A>stocks. While so bound, finding himself left alone with a single keeper, 
<A NAME="964"></A>he asked the man for a knife. The keeper at first refused, whereupon Cleomenes 
<A NAME="965"></A>began to threaten him, until at last he was afraid, being only a helot, 
<A NAME="966"></A>and gave him what he required. Cleomenes had no sooner got the steel than, 
<A NAME="967"></A>beginning at his legs, he horribly disfigured himself, cutting gashes in 
<A NAME="968"></A>his flesh, along his legs, thighs, hips, and loins, until at last he reached 
<A NAME="969"></A>his belly, which he likewise began to gash, whereupon in a little time 
<A NAME="970"></A>he died. The Greeks generally think that this fate came upon him because 
<A NAME="971"></A>he induced the Pythoness to pronounce against Demaratus; the Athenians 
<A NAME="972"></A>differ from all others in saying that it was because he cut down the sacred 
<A NAME="973"></A>grove of the goddesses when he made his invasion by Eleusis; while the 
<A NAME="974"></A>Argives ascribe it to his having taken from their refuge and cut to pieces 
<A NAME="975"></A>certain argives who had fled from battle into a precinct sacred to Argus, 
<A NAME="976"></A>where Cleomenes slew them, burning likewise at the same time, through irreverence, 
<A NAME="977"></A>the grove itself.
<A NAME="978"></A><BR><BR>For once, when Cleomenes had sent to Delphi to consult the oracle, 
<A NAME="979"></A>it was prophesied to him that he should take Argos; upon which he went 
<A NAME="980"></A>out at the head of the Spartans, and led them to the river Erasinus. This 
<A NAME="981"></A>stream is reported to flow from the Stymphalian lake, the waters of which 
<A NAME="982"></A>empty themselves into a pitch-dark chasm, and then (as they say) reappear 
<A NAME="983"></A>in Argos, where the Argives call them the Erasinus. Cleomenes, having arrived 
<A NAME="984"></A>upon the banks of this river, proceeded to offer sacrifice to it, but, 
<A NAME="985"></A>in spite of all that he could do, the victims were not favourable to his 
<A NAME="986"></A>crossing. So he said that he admired the god for refusing to betray his 
<A NAME="987"></A>countrymen, but still the Argives should not escape him for all that. He 
<A NAME="988"></A>then withdrew his troops, and led them down to Thyrea, where he sacrificed 
<A NAME="989"></A>a bull to the sea, and conveyed his men on shipboard to Nauplia in the 
<A NAME="990"></A>Tirynthian territory.
<A NAME="991"></A><BR><BR>The Argives, when they heard of this, marched down to the sea to 
<A NAME="992"></A>defend their country; and arriving in the neighbourhood of Tiryns, at the 
<A NAME="993"></A>place which bears the name of Sepeia, they pitched their camp opposite 
<A NAME="994"></A>to the Lacedaemonians, leaving no great space between the hosts. And now 
<A NAME="995"></A>their fear was not so much lest they should be worsted in open fight as 
<A NAME="996"></A>lest some trick should be practised on them; for such was the danger which 
<A NAME="997"></A>the oracle given to them in common with the Milesians seemed to intimate. 
<A NAME="998"></A>The oracle ran as follows:-
<A NAME="999"></A><BR><BR>Time shall be when the female shall conquer the male, and shall 
<A NAME="1000"></A>chase him
<A NAME="1001"></A><BR>Far away- gaining so great praise and honour in 
<A NAME="1002"></A>Argos;
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR>Then full many an Argive woman her cheeks shall 
<A NAME="1004"></A>mangle
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR>Hence, in the times to come 'twill be said by the men who are 
<A NAME="1006"></A>unborn,
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR>"Tamed by the spear expired the coiled terrible serpent." At the coincidence 
<A NAME="1008"></A>of all these things the Argives were greatly cast down; and so they resolved 
<A NAME="1009"></A>that they would follow the signals of the enemy's herald. Having made this 
<A NAME="1010"></A>resolve, they proceeded to act as follows: whenever the herald of the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="1011"></A>gave an order to the soldiers of his own army, the Argives did the like 
<A NAME="1012"></A>on their side.
<A NAME="1013"></A><BR><BR>Now when Cleomenes heard that the Argives were acting thus, he 
<A NAME="1014"></A>commanded his troops that, so soon as the herald gave the word for the 
<A NAME="1015"></A>soldiers to go to dinner, they should instantly seize their arms and charge 
<A NAME="1016"></A>the host of the enemy. Which the Lacedaemonians did accordingly, and fell 
<A NAME="1017"></A>upon the Argives just as, following the signal, they had begun their repast; 
<A NAME="1018"></A>whereby it came to pass that vast numbers of the Argives were slain, while 
<A NAME="1019"></A>the rest, who were more than they which died in the fight, were driven 
<A NAME="1020"></A>to take refuge in the grove of Argus hard by, where they were surrounded, 
<A NAME="1021"></A>and watch kept upon them.
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR><BR>When things were at this pass Cleomenes acted as follows: Having 
<A NAME="1023"></A>learnt the names of the Argives who were shut up in the sacred precinct 
<A NAME="1024"></A>from certain deserters who had come over to him, he sent a herald to summon 
<A NAME="1025"></A>them one by one, on pretence of having received their ransoms. Now the 
<A NAME="1026"></A>ransom of prisoners among the Peloponnesians is fixed at two minae the 
<A NAME="1027"></A>man. So Cleomenes had these persons called forth severally, to the number 
<A NAME="1028"></A>of fifty, or thereabouts, and massacred them. All this while they who remained 
<A NAME="1029"></A>in the enclosure knew nothing of what was happening; for the grove was 
<A NAME="1030"></A>so thick that the people inside were unable to see what was taking place 
<A NAME="1031"></A>without. But at last one of their number climbed up into a tree and spied 
<A NAME="1032"></A>the treachery; after which none of those who were summoned would go 
<A NAME="1033"></A>forth.
<A NAME="1034"></A><BR><BR>Then Cleomenes ordered all the helots to bring brushwood, and heap 
<A NAME="1035"></A>it around the grove; which was done accordingly; and Cleomenes set the 
<A NAME="1036"></A>grove on fire. As the flames spread he asked a deserter "Who was the god 
<A NAME="1037"></A>of the grove?" whereto the other made answer, "Argus." So he, when he heard 
<A NAME="1038"></A>that, uttered a loud groan, and said:-
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR><BR>"Greatly hast thou deceived me, Apollo, god of prophecy, in saying 
<A NAME="1040"></A>that I should take Argos. I fear me thy oracle has now got its 
<A NAME="1041"></A>accomplishment."
<A NAME="1042"></A><BR><BR>Cleomenes now sent home the greater part of his army, while with 
<A NAME="1043"></A>a thousand of his best troops he proceeded to the temple of Juno, to offer 
<A NAME="1044"></A>sacrifice. When however he would have slain the victim on the altar himself, 
<A NAME="1045"></A>the priest forbade him, as it was not lawful (he said) for a foreigner 
<A NAME="1046"></A>to sacrifice in that temple. At this Cleomenes ordered his helots to drag 
<A NAME="1047"></A>the priest from the altar and scourge him, while he performed the sacrifice 
<A NAME="1048"></A>himself, after which he went back to Sparta.
<A NAME="1049"></A><BR><BR>Thereupon his enemies brought him up before the Ephors, and made 
<A NAME="1050"></A>it a charge against him that he had allowed himself to be bribed, and on 
<A NAME="1051"></A>that account had not taken Argos when he might have captured it easily. 
<A NAME="1052"></A>To this he answered- whether truly or falsely I cannot say with certainty- 
<A NAME="1053"></A>but at any rate his answer to the charge was that "so soon as he discovered 
<A NAME="1054"></A>the sacred precinct which he had taken to belong to Argos, he directly 
<A NAME="1055"></A>imagined that the oracle had received its accomplishment; he therefore 
<A NAME="1056"></A>thought it not good to attempt the town, at the least until he had inquired 
<A NAME="1057"></A>by sacrifice, and ascertained if the god meant to grant him the place, 
<A NAME="1058"></A>or was determined to oppose his taking it. So he offered in the temple 
<A NAME="1059"></A>of Juno, and when the omens were propitious, immediately there flashed 
<A NAME="1060"></A>forth a flame of fire from the breast of the image; whereby he knew of 
<A NAME="1061"></A>a surety that he was not to take Argos. For if the flash had come from 
<A NAME="1062"></A>the head, he would have gained the town, citadel and all; but as it shone 
<A NAME="1063"></A>from the breast, he had done so much as the god intended." And his words 
<A NAME="1064"></A>seemed to the Spartans so true and reasonable, that he came clear off from 
<A NAME="1065"></A>his adversaries.
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR><BR>Argos however was left so bare of men that the slaves managed the 
<A NAME="1067"></A>state, filled the offices, and administered everything until the sons of 
<A NAME="1068"></A>those who were slain by Cleomenes grew up. Then these latter cast out the 
<A NAME="1069"></A>slaves, and got the city back under their own rule; while the slaves who 
<A NAME="1070"></A>had been driven out fought a battle and won Tiryns. After this for a time 
<A NAME="1071"></A>there was peace between the two; but a certain man, a soothsayer, named 
<A NAME="1072"></A>Cleander, who was by race a Phigalean from Arcadia, joined himself to the 
<A NAME="1073"></A>slaves, and stirred them up to make a fresh attack upon their lords. Then 
<A NAME="1074"></A>were they at war with one another by the space of many years; but at length 
<A NAME="1075"></A>the Argives with much trouble gained the upper hand.
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR><BR>The Argives say that Cleomenes lost his senses, and died so miserably, 
<A NAME="1077"></A>on account of these doings. But his own countrymen declare that his madness 
<A NAME="1078"></A>proceeded not from any supernatural cause whatever, but only from the habit 
<A NAME="1079"></A>of drinking wine unmixed with water, which he learnt of the Scyths. These 
<A NAME="1080"></A>nomads, from the time that Darius made his inroad into their country, had 
<A NAME="1081"></A>always had a wish for revenge. They therefore sent ambassadors to Sparta 
<A NAME="1082"></A>to conclude a league, proposing to endeavour themselves to enter Media 
<A NAME="1083"></A>by the Phasis, while the Spartans should march inland from Ephesus, and 
<A NAME="1084"></A>then the two armies should join together in one. When the Scyths came to 
<A NAME="1085"></A>Sparta on this errand Cleomenes was with them continually; and growing 
<A NAME="1086"></A>somewhat too familiar, learnt of them to drink his wine without water, 
<A NAME="1087"></A>a practice which is thought by the Spartans to have caused his madness. 
<A NAME="1088"></A>From this distance of time the Spartans, according to their own account, 
<A NAME="1089"></A>have been accustomed, when they want to drink purer wine than common, to 
<A NAME="1090"></A>give the order to fill "Scythian fashion." The Spartans then speak thus 
<A NAME="1091"></A>concerning Cleomenes; but for my own part I think his death was a judgment 
<A NAME="1092"></A>on him for wronging Demaratus.
<A NAME="1093"></A><BR><BR>No sooner did the news of Cleomenes' death reach Egina than straightway 
<A NAME="1094"></A>the Eginetans sent ambassadors to Sparta to complain of the conduct of 
<A NAME="1095"></A>Leotychides in respect of their hostages, who were still kept at Athens. 
<A NAME="1096"></A>So they of Lacedaemon assembled a court of justice and gave sentence upon 
<A NAME="1097"></A>Leotychides, that whereas he had grossly affronted the people of Egina, 
<A NAME="1098"></A>he should be given up to the ambassadors, to be led away in place of the 
<A NAME="1099"></A>men whom the Athenians had in their keeping. Then the ambassadors were 
<A NAME="1100"></A>about to lead him away; but Theasides, the son of Leoprepes, who was a 
<A NAME="1101"></A>man greatly esteemed in Sparta, interfered, and said to 
<A NAME="1102"></A>them:-
