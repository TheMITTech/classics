<A NAME="start"></A>
<A NAME="10"></A><B>Clio</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>These are the researches of Herodotus of Halicarnassus, which he 
<A NAME="12"></A>publishes, in the hope of thereby preserving from decay the remembrance 
<A NAME="13"></A>of what men have done, and of preventing the great and wonderful actions 
<A NAME="14"></A>of the Greeks and the Barbarians from losing their due meed of glory; and 
<A NAME="15"></A>withal to put on record what were their grounds of feuds.  According to 
<A NAME="16"></A>the Persians best informed in history, the Phoenicians began to quarrel. 
<A NAME="17"></A>This people, who had formerly dwelt on the shores of the Erythraean Sea, 
<A NAME="18"></A>having migrated to the Mediterranean and settled in the parts which they 
<A NAME="19"></A>now inhabit, began at once, they say, to adventure on long voyages, freighting 
<A NAME="20"></A>their vessels with the wares of Egypt and Assyria. They landed at many 
<A NAME="21"></A>places on the coast, and among the rest at Argos, which was then preeminent 
<A NAME="22"></A>above all the states included now under the common name of Hellas. Here 
<A NAME="23"></A>they exposed their merchandise, and traded with the natives for five or 
<A NAME="24"></A>six days; at the end of which time, when almost everything was sold, there 
<A NAME="25"></A>came down to the beach a number of women, and among them the daughter of 
<A NAME="26"></A>the king, who was, they say, agreeing in this with the Greeks, Io, the 
<A NAME="27"></A>child of Inachus. The women were standing by the stern of the ship intent 
<A NAME="28"></A>upon their purchases, when the Phoenicians, with a general shout, rushed 
<A NAME="29"></A>upon them. The greater part made their escape, but some were seized and 
<A NAME="30"></A>carried off. Io herself was among the captives. The Phoenicians put the 
<A NAME="31"></A>women on board their vessel, and set sail for Egypt. Thus did Io pass into 
<A NAME="32"></A>Egypt, according to the Persian story, which differs widely from the Phoenician: 
<A NAME="33"></A>and thus commenced, according to their authors, the series of 
<A NAME="34"></A>outrages.
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR>At a later period, certain Greeks, with whose name they are unacquainted, 
<A NAME="36"></A>but who would probably be Cretans, made a landing at Tyre, on the Phoenician 
<A NAME="37"></A>coast, and bore off the king's daughter, Europe. In this they only retaliated; 
<A NAME="38"></A>but afterwards the Greeks, they say, were guilty of a second violence. 
<A NAME="39"></A>They manned a ship of war, and sailed to Aea, a city of Colchis, on the 
<A NAME="40"></A>river Phasis; from whence, after despatching the rest of the business on 
<A NAME="41"></A>which they had come, they carried off Medea, the daughter of the king of 
<A NAME="42"></A>the land. The monarch sent a herald into Greece to demand reparation of 
<A NAME="43"></A>the wrong, and the restitution of his child; but the Greeks made answer 
<A NAME="44"></A>that, having received no reparation of the wrong done them in the seizure 
<A NAME="45"></A>of Io the Argive, they should give none in this instance.
<A NAME="46"></A><BR><BR>In the next generation afterwards, according to the same authorities, 
<A NAME="47"></A>Alexander the son of Priam, bearing these events in mind, resolved to procure 
<A NAME="48"></A>himself a wife out of Greece by violence, fully persuaded, that as the 
<A NAME="49"></A>Greeks had not given satisfaction for their outrages, so neither would 
<A NAME="50"></A>he be forced to make any for his. Accordingly he made prize of Helen; upon 
<A NAME="51"></A>which the Greeks decided that, before resorting to other measures, they 
<A NAME="52"></A>would send envoys to reclaim the princess and require reparation of the 
<A NAME="53"></A>wrong. Their demands were met by a reference to the violence which had 
<A NAME="54"></A>been offered to Medea, and they were asked with what face they could now 
<A NAME="55"></A>require satisfaction, when they had formerly rejected all demands for either 
<A NAME="56"></A>reparation or restitution addressed to them.
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR>Hitherto the injuries on either side had been mere acts of common 
<A NAME="58"></A>violence; but in what followed the Persians consider that the Greeks were 
<A NAME="59"></A>greatly to blame, since before any attack had been made on Europe, they 
<A NAME="60"></A>led an army into Asia. Now as for the carrying off of women, it is the 
<A NAME="61"></A>deed, they say, of a rogue: but to make a stir about such as are carried 
<A NAME="62"></A>off, argues a man a fool. Men of sense care nothing for such women, since 
<A NAME="63"></A>it is plain that without their own consent they would never be forced away. 
<A NAME="64"></A>The Asiatics, when the Greeks ran off with their women, never troubled 
<A NAME="65"></A>themselves about the matter; but the Greeks, for the sake of a single Lacedaemonian 
<A NAME="66"></A>girl, collected a vast armament, invaded Asia, and destroyed the kingdom 
<A NAME="67"></A>of Priam. Henceforth they ever looked upon the Greeks as their open enemies. 
<A NAME="68"></A>For Asia, with all the various tribes of barbarians that inhabit it, is 
<A NAME="69"></A>regarded by the Persians as their own; but Europe and the Greek race they 
<A NAME="70"></A>look on as distinct and separate.
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>Such is the account which the Persians give of these matters. They 
<A NAME="72"></A>trace to the attack upon Troy their ancient enmity towards the Greeks. 
<A NAME="73"></A>The Phoenicians, however, as regards Io, vary from the Persian statements. 
<A NAME="74"></A>They deny that they used any violence to remove her into Egypt; she herself, 
<A NAME="75"></A>they say, having formed an intimacy with the captain, while his vessel 
<A NAME="76"></A>lay at Argos, and perceiving herself to be with child, of her own free 
<A NAME="77"></A>will accompanied the Phoenicians on their leaving the shore, to escape 
<A NAME="78"></A>the shame of detection and the reproaches of her parents. Whether this 
<A NAME="79"></A>latter account be true, or whether the matter happened otherwise, I shall 
<A NAME="80"></A>not discuss further. I shall proceed at once to point out the person who 
<A NAME="81"></A>first within my own knowledge inflicted injury on the Greeks, after which 
<A NAME="82"></A>I shall go forward with my history, describing equally the greater and 
<A NAME="83"></A>the lesser cities. For the cities which were formerly great have most of 
<A NAME="84"></A>them become insignificant; and such as are at present powerful, were weak 
<A NAME="85"></A>in the olden time. I shall therefore discourse equally of both, convinced 
<A NAME="86"></A>that human happiness never continues long in one stay.
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR>Croesus, son of Alyattes, by birth a Lydian, was lord of all the 
<A NAME="88"></A>nations to the west of the river Halys. This stream, which separates Syria 
<A NAME="89"></A>from Paphlagonia, runs with a course from south to north, and finally falls 
<A NAME="90"></A>into the Euxine. So far as our knowledge goes, he was the first of the 
<A NAME="91"></A>barbarians who had dealings with the Greeks, forcing some of them to become 
<A NAME="92"></A>his tributaries, and entering into alliance with others. He conquered the 
<A NAME="93"></A>Aeolians, Ionians, and Dorians of Asia, and made a treaty with the Lacedaemonians. 
<A NAME="94"></A>Up to that time all Greeks had been free. For the Cimmerian attack upon 
<A NAME="95"></A>Ionia, which was earlier than Croesus, was not a conquest of the cities, 
<A NAME="96"></A>but only an inroad for plundering.
<A NAME="97"></A><BR><BR>The sovereignty of Lydia, which had belonged to the Heraclides, 
<A NAME="98"></A>passed into the family of Croesus, who were called the Mermnadae, in the 
<A NAME="99"></A>manner which I will now relate. There was a certain king of Sardis, Candaules 
<A NAME="100"></A>by name, whom the Greeks called Myrsilus. He was a descendant of Alcaeus, 
<A NAME="101"></A>son of Hercules. The first king of this dynasty was Agron, son of Ninus, 
<A NAME="102"></A>grandson of Belus, and great-grandson of Alcaeus; Candaules, son of Myrsus, 
<A NAME="103"></A>was the last. The kings who reigned before Agron sprang from Lydus, son 
<A NAME="104"></A>of Atys, from whom the people of the land, called previously Meonians, 
<A NAME="105"></A>received the name of Lydians. The Heraclides, descended from Hercules and 
<A NAME="106"></A>the slave-girl of Jardanus, having been entrusted by these princes with 
<A NAME="107"></A>the management of affairs, obtained the kingdom by an oracle. Their rule 
<A NAME="108"></A>endured for two and twenty generations of men, a space of five hundred 
<A NAME="109"></A>and five years; during the whole of which period, from Agron to Candaules, 
<A NAME="110"></A>the crown descended in the direct line from father to 
<A NAME="111"></A>son.
<A NAME="112"></A><BR><BR>Now it happened that this Candaules was in love with his own wife; 
<A NAME="113"></A>and not only so, but thought her the fairest woman in the whole world. 
<A NAME="114"></A>This fancy had strange consequences. There was in his bodyguard a man whom 
<A NAME="115"></A>he specially favoured, Gyges, the son of Dascylus. All affairs of greatest 
<A NAME="116"></A>moment were entrusted by Candaules to this person, and to him he was wont 
<A NAME="117"></A>to extol the surpassing beauty of his wife. So matters went on for a while. 
<A NAME="118"></A>At length, one day, Candaules, who was fated to end ill, thus addressed 
<A NAME="119"></A>his follower: "I see thou dost not credit what I tell thee of my lady's 
<A NAME="120"></A>loveliness; but come now, since men's ears are less credulous than their 
<A NAME="121"></A>eyes, contrive some means whereby thou mayst behold her naked." At this 
<A NAME="122"></A>the other loudly exclaimed, saying, "What most unwise speech is this, master, 
<A NAME="123"></A>which thou hast uttered? Wouldst thou have me behold my mistress when she 
<A NAME="124"></A>is naked? Bethink thee that a woman, with her clothes, puts off her bashfulness. 
<A NAME="125"></A>Our fathers, in time past, distinguished right and wrong plainly enough, 
<A NAME="126"></A>and it is our wisdom to submit to be taught by them. There is an old saying, 
<A NAME="127"></A>'Let each look on his own.' I hold thy wife for the fairest of all womankind. 
<A NAME="128"></A>Only, I beseech thee, ask me not to do wickedly."
<A NAME="129"></A><BR><BR>Gyges thus endeavoured to decline the king's proposal, trembling 
<A NAME="130"></A>lest some dreadful evil should befall him through it. But the king replied 
<A NAME="131"></A>to him, "Courage, friend; suspect me not of the design to prove thee by 
<A NAME="132"></A>this discourse; nor dread thy mistress, lest mischief be. thee at her hands. 
<A NAME="133"></A>Be sure I will so manage that she shall not even know that thou hast looked 
<A NAME="134"></A>upon her. I will place thee behind the open door of the chamber in which 
<A NAME="135"></A>we sleep. When I enter to go to rest she will follow me. There stands a 
<A NAME="136"></A>chair close to the entrance, on which she will lay her clothes one by one 
<A NAME="137"></A>as she takes them off. Thou wilt be able thus at thy leisure to peruse 
<A NAME="138"></A>her person. Then, when she is moving from the chair toward the bed, and 
<A NAME="139"></A>her back is turned on thee, be it thy care that she see thee not as thou 
<A NAME="140"></A>passest through the doorway."
<A NAME="141"></A><BR><BR>Gyges, unable to escape, could but declare his readiness. Then 
<A NAME="142"></A>Candaules, when bedtime came, led Gyges into his sleeping-chamber, and 
<A NAME="143"></A>a moment after the queen followed. She entered, and laid her garments on 
<A NAME="144"></A>the chair, and Gyges gazed on her. After a while she moved toward the bed, 
<A NAME="145"></A>and her back being then turned, he glided stealthily from the apartment. 
<A NAME="146"></A>As he was passing out, however, she saw him, and instantly divining what 
<A NAME="147"></A>had happened, she neither screamed as her shame impelled her, nor even 
<A NAME="148"></A>appeared to have noticed aught, purposing to take vengeance upon the husband 
<A NAME="149"></A>who had so affronted her. For among the Lydians, and indeed among the barbarians 
<A NAME="150"></A>generally, it is reckoned a deep disgrace, even to a man, to be seen 
<A NAME="151"></A>naked.
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR>No sound or sign of intelligence escaped her at the time. But in 
<A NAME="153"></A>the morning, as soon as day broke, she hastened to choose from among her 
<A NAME="154"></A>retinue such as she knew to be most faithful to her, and preparing them 
<A NAME="155"></A>for what was to ensue, summoned Gyges into her presence. Now it had often 
<A NAME="156"></A>happened before that the queen had desired to confer with him, and he was 
<A NAME="157"></A>accustomed to come to her at her call. He therefore obeyed the summons, 
<A NAME="158"></A>not suspecting that she knew aught of what had occurred. Then she addressed 
<A NAME="159"></A>these words to him: "Take thy choice, Gyges, of two courses which are open 
<A NAME="160"></A>to thee. Slay Candaules, and thereby become my lord, and obtain the Lydian 
<A NAME="161"></A>throne, or die this moment in his room. So wilt thou not again, obeying 
<A NAME="162"></A>all behests of thy master, behold what is not lawful for thee. It must 
<A NAME="163"></A>needs be that either he perish by whose counsel this thing was done, or 
<A NAME="164"></A>thou, who sawest me naked, and so didst break our usages." At these words 
<A NAME="165"></A>Gyges stood awhile in mute astonishment; recovering after a time, he earnestly 
<A NAME="166"></A>besought the queen that she would not compel him to so hard a choice. But 
<A NAME="167"></A>finding he implored in vain, and that necessity was indeed laid on him 
<A NAME="168"></A>to kill or to be killed, he made choice of life for himself, and replied 
<A NAME="169"></A>by this inquiry: "If it must be so, and thou compellest me against my will 
<A NAME="170"></A>to put my lord to death, come, let me hear how thou wilt have me set on 
<A NAME="171"></A>him." "Let him be attacked," she answered, "on the spot where I was by 
<A NAME="172"></A>him shown naked to you, and let the assault be made when he is 
<A NAME="173"></A>asleep."
<A NAME="174"></A><BR><BR>All was then prepared for the attack, and when night fell, Gyges, 
<A NAME="175"></A>seeing that he had no retreat or escape, but must absolutely either slay 
<A NAME="176"></A>Candaules, or himself be slain, followed his mistress into the sleeping-room. 
<A NAME="177"></A>She placed a dagger in his hand and hid him carefully behind the self-same 
<A NAME="178"></A>door. Then Gyges, when the king was fallen asleep, entered privily into 
<A NAME="179"></A>the chamber and struck him dead. Thus did the wife and kingdom of Candaules 
<A NAME="180"></A>pass into the possession of Gyges, of whom Archilochus the Parian, who 
<A NAME="181"></A>lived about the same time, made mention in a poem written in iambic trimeter 
<A NAME="182"></A>verse.
<A NAME="183"></A><BR><BR>Gyges was afterwards confirmed in the possession of the throne 
<A NAME="184"></A>by an answer of the Delphic oracle. Enraged at the murder of their king, 
<A NAME="185"></A>the people flew to arms, but after a while the partisans of Gyges came 
<A NAME="186"></A>to terms with them, and it was agreed that if the Delphic oracle declared 
<A NAME="187"></A>him king of the Lydians, he should reign; if otherwise, he should yield 
<A NAME="188"></A>the throne to the Heraclides. As the oracle was given in his favour he 
<A NAME="189"></A>became king. The Pythoness, however, added that, in the fifth generation 
<A NAME="190"></A>from Gyges, vengeance should come for the Heraclides; a prophecy of which 
<A NAME="191"></A>neither the Lydians nor their princes took any account till it was fulfilled. 
<A NAME="192"></A>Such was the way in which the Mermnadae deposed the Heraclides, and themselves 
<A NAME="193"></A>obtained the sovereignty.
<A NAME="194"></A><BR><BR>When Gyges was established on the throne, he sent no small presents 
<A NAME="195"></A>to Delphi, as his many silver offerings at the Delphic shrine testify. 
<A NAME="196"></A>Besides this silver he gave a vast number of vessels of gold, among which 
<A NAME="197"></A>the most worthy of mention are the goblets, six in number, and weighing 
<A NAME="198"></A>altogether thirty talents, which stand in the Corinthian treasury, dedicated 
<A NAME="199"></A>by him. I call it the Corinthian treasury, though in strictness of speech 
<A NAME="200"></A>it is the treasury not of the whole Corinthian people, but of Cypselus, 
<A NAME="201"></A>son of Eetion. Excepting Midas, son of Gordias, king of Phrygia, Gyges 
<A NAME="202"></A>was the first of the barbarians whom we know to have sent offerings to 
<A NAME="203"></A>Delphi. Midas dedicated the royal throne whereon he was accustomed to sit 
<A NAME="204"></A>and administer justice, an object well worth looking at. It lies in the 
<A NAME="205"></A>same place as the goblets presented by Gyges. The Delphians call the whole 
<A NAME="206"></A>of the silver and the gold which Gyges dedicated, after the name of the 
<A NAME="207"></A>donor, Gygian.
<A NAME="208"></A><BR><BR>As soon as Gyges was king he made an in-road on Miletus and Smyrna, 
<A NAME="209"></A>and took the city of Colophon. Afterwards, however, though he reigned eight 
<A NAME="210"></A>and thirty years, he did not perform a single noble exploit. I shall therefore 
<A NAME="211"></A>make no further mention of him, but pass on to his son and successor in 
<A NAME="212"></A>the kingdom, Ardys.
<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR>Ardys took Priene and made war upon Miletus. In his reign the Cimmerians, 
<A NAME="214"></A>driven from their homes by the nomads of Scythia, entered Asia and captured 
<A NAME="215"></A>Sardis, all but the citadel. He reigned forty-nine years, and was succeeded 
<A NAME="216"></A>by his son, Sadyattes, who reigned twelve years. At his death his son Alyattes 
<A NAME="217"></A>mounted the throne.
<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR>This prince waged war with the Medes under Cyaxares, the grandson 
<A NAME="219"></A>of Deioces, drove the Cimmerians out of Asia, conquered Smyrna, the Colophonian 
<A NAME="220"></A>colony, and invaded Clazomenae. From this last contest he did not come 
<A NAME="221"></A>off as he could have wished, but met with a sore defeat; still, however, 
<A NAME="222"></A>in the course of his reign, he performed other actions very worthy of note, 
<A NAME="223"></A>of which I will now proceed to give an account.
<A NAME="224"></A><BR><BR>Inheriting from his father a war with the Milesians, he pressed 
<A NAME="225"></A>the siege against the city by attacking it in the following manner. When 
<A NAME="226"></A>the harvest was ripe on the ground he marched his army into Milesia to 
<A NAME="227"></A>the sound of pipes and harps, and flutes masculine and feminine. The buildings 
<A NAME="228"></A>that were scattered over the country he neither pulled down nor burnt, 
<A NAME="229"></A>nor did he even tear away the doors, but left them standing as they were. 
<A NAME="230"></A>He cut down, however, and utterly destroyed all the trees and all the corn 
<A NAME="231"></A>throughout the land, and then returned to his own dominions. It was idle 
<A NAME="232"></A>for his army to sit down before the place, as the Milesians were masters 
<A NAME="233"></A>of the sea. The reason that he did not demolish their buildings was that 
<A NAME="234"></A>the inhabitants might be tempted to use them as homesteads from which to 
<A NAME="235"></A>go forth to sow and till their lands; and so each time that he invaded 
<A NAME="236"></A>the country he might find something to plunder.
<A NAME="237"></A><BR><BR>In this way he carried on the war with the Milesians for eleven 
<A NAME="238"></A>years, in the course of which he inflicted on them two terrible blows; 
<A NAME="239"></A>one in their own country in the district of Limeneium, the other in the 
<A NAME="240"></A>plain of the Maeander. During six of these eleven years, Sadyattes, the 
<A NAME="241"></A>son of Ardys who first lighted the flames of this war, was king of Lydia, 
<A NAME="242"></A>and made the incursions. Only the five following years belong to the reign 
<A NAME="243"></A>of Alyattes, son of Sadyattes, who (as I said before) inheriting the war 
<A NAME="244"></A>from his father, applied himself to it unremittingly. The Milesians throughout 
<A NAME="245"></A>the contest received no help at all from any of the Ionians, excepting 
<A NAME="246"></A>those of Chios, who lent them troops in requital of a like service rendered 
<A NAME="247"></A>them in former times, the Milesians having fought on the side of the Chians 
<A NAME="248"></A>during the whole of the war between them and the people of 
<A NAME="249"></A>Erythrae.
<A NAME="250"></A><BR><BR>It was in the twelfth year of the war that the following mischance 
<A NAME="251"></A>occurred from the firing of the harvest-fields. Scarcely had the corn been 
<A NAME="252"></A>set alight by the soldiers when a violent wind carried the flames against 
<A NAME="253"></A>the temple of Minerva Assesia, which caught fire and was burnt to the ground. 
<A NAME="254"></A>At the time no one made any account of the circumstance; but afterwards, 
<A NAME="255"></A>on the return of the army to Sardis, Alyattes fell sick. His illness continued, 
<A NAME="256"></A>whereupon, either advised thereto by some friend, or perchance himself 
<A NAME="257"></A>conceiving the idea, he sent messengers to Delphi to inquire of the god 
<A NAME="258"></A>concerning his malady. On their arrival the Pythoness declared that no 
<A NAME="259"></A>answer should be given them until they had rebuilt the temple of Minerva, 
<A NAME="260"></A>burnt by the Lydians at Assesus in Milesia.
<A NAME="261"></A><BR><BR>Thus much I know from information given me by the Delphians; the 
<A NAME="262"></A>remainder of the story the Milesians add.
<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR>The answer made by the oracle came to the ears of Periander, son 
<A NAME="264"></A>of Cypselus, who was a very close friend to Thrasybulus, tyrant of Miletus 
<A NAME="265"></A>at that period. He instantly despatched a messenger to report the oracle 
<A NAME="266"></A>to him, in order that Thrasybulus, forewarned of its tenor, might the better 
<A NAME="267"></A>adapt his measures to the posture of affairs.
<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR>Alyattes, the moment that the words of the oracle were reported 
<A NAME="269"></A>to him, sent a herald to Miletus in hopes of concluding a truce with Thrasybulus 
<A NAME="270"></A>and the Milesians for such a time as was needed to rebuild the temple. 
<A NAME="271"></A>The herald went upon his way; but meantime Thrasybulus had been apprised 
<A NAME="272"></A>of everything; and conjecturing what Alyattes would do, he contrived this 
<A NAME="273"></A>artifice. He had all the corn that was in the city, whether belonging to 
<A NAME="274"></A>himself or to private persons, brought into the market-place, and issued 
<A NAME="275"></A>an order that the Milesians should hold themselves in readiness, and, when 
<A NAME="276"></A>he gave the signal, should, one and all, fall to drinking and 
<A NAME="277"></A>revelry.
<A NAME="278"></A><BR><BR>The purpose for which he gave these orders was the following. He 
<A NAME="279"></A>hoped that the Sardian herald, seeing so great store of corn upon the ground, 
<A NAME="280"></A>and all the city given up to festivity, would inform Alyattes of it, which 
<A NAME="281"></A>fell out as he anticipated. The herald observed the whole, and when he 
<A NAME="282"></A>had delivered his message, went back to Sardis. This circumstance alone, 
<A NAME="283"></A>as I gather, brought about the peace which ensued. Alyattes, who had hoped 
<A NAME="284"></A>that there was now a great scarcity of corn in Miletus, and that the people 
<A NAME="285"></A>were worn down to the last pitch of suffering, when he heard from the herald 
<A NAME="286"></A>on his return from Miletus tidings so contrary to those he had expected, 
<A NAME="287"></A>made a treaty with the enemy by which the two nations became close friends 
<A NAME="288"></A>and allies. He then built at Assesus two temples to Minerva instead of 
<A NAME="289"></A>one, and shortly after recovered from his malady. Such were the chief circumstances 
<A NAME="290"></A>of the war which Alyattes waged with Thrasybulus and the 
<A NAME="291"></A>Milesians.
<A NAME="292"></A><BR><BR>This Periander, who apprised Thrasybulus of the oracle, was son 
<A NAME="293"></A>of Cypselus, and tyrant of Corinth. In his time a very wonderful thing 
<A NAME="294"></A>is said to have happened. The Corinthians and the Lesbians agree in their 
<A NAME="295"></A>account of the matter. They relate that Arion of Methymna, who as a player 
<A NAME="296"></A>on the harp, was second to no man living at that time, and who was, so 
<A NAME="297"></A>far as we know, the first to invent the dithyrambic measure, to give it 
<A NAME="298"></A>its name, and to recite in it at Corinth, was carried to Taenarum on the 
<A NAME="299"></A>back of a dolphin.
<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR>He had lived for many years at the court of Periander, when a longing 
<A NAME="301"></A>came upon him to sail across to Italy and Sicily. Having made rich profits 
<A NAME="302"></A>in those parts, he wanted to recross the seas to Corinth. He therefore 
<A NAME="303"></A>hired a vessel, the crew of which were Corinthians, thinking that there 
<A NAME="304"></A>was no people in whom he could more safely confide; and, going on board, 
<A NAME="305"></A>he set sail from Tarentum. The sailors, however, when they reached the 
<A NAME="306"></A>open sea, formed a plot to throw him overboard and seize upon his riches. 
<A NAME="307"></A>Discovering their design, he fell on his knees, beseeching them to spare 
<A NAME="308"></A>his life, and making them welcome to his money. But they refused; and required 
<A NAME="309"></A>him either to kill himself outright, if he wished for a grave on the dry 
<A NAME="310"></A>land, or without loss of time to leap overboard into the sea. In this strait 
<A NAME="311"></A>Arion begged them, since such was their pleasure, to allow him to mount 
<A NAME="312"></A>upon the quarter-deck, dressed in his full costume, and there to play and 
<A NAME="313"></A>sing, and promising that, as soon as his song was ended, he would destroy 
<A NAME="314"></A>himself. Delighted at the prospect of hearing the very best harper in the 
<A NAME="315"></A>world, they consented, and withdrew from the stern to the middle of the 
<A NAME="316"></A>vessel: while Arion dressed himself in the full costume of his calling, 
<A NAME="317"></A>took his harp, and standing on the quarter-deck, chanted the Orthian. His 
<A NAME="318"></A>strain ended, he flung himself, fully attired as he was, headlong into 
<A NAME="319"></A>the sea. The Corinthians then sailed on to Corinth. As for Arion, a dolphin, 
<A NAME="320"></A>they say, took him upon his back and carried him to Taenarum, where he 
<A NAME="321"></A>went ashore, and thence proceeded to Corinth in his musician's dress, and 
<A NAME="322"></A>told all that had happened to him. Periander, however, disbelieved the 
<A NAME="323"></A>story, and put Arion in ward, to prevent his leaving Corinth, while he 
<A NAME="324"></A>watched anxiously for the return of the mariners. On their arrival he summoned 
<A NAME="325"></A>them before him and asked them if they could give him any tiding of Arion. 
<A NAME="326"></A>They returned for answer that he was alive and in good health in Italy, 
<A NAME="327"></A>and that they had left him at Tarentum, where he was doing well. Thereupon 
<A NAME="328"></A>Arion appeared before them, just as he was when he jumped from the vessel: 
<A NAME="329"></A>the men, astonished and detected in falsehood, could no longer deny their 
<A NAME="330"></A>guilt. Such is the account which the Corinthians and Lesbians give; and 
<A NAME="331"></A>there is to this day at Taenarum, an offering of Arion's at the shrine, 
<A NAME="332"></A>which is a small figure in bronze, representing a man seated upon a 
<A NAME="333"></A>dolphin.
<A NAME="334"></A><BR><BR>Having brought the war with the Milesians to a close, and reigned 
<A NAME="335"></A>over the land of Lydia for fifty-seven years, Alyattes died. He was the 
<A NAME="336"></A>second prince of his house who made offerings at Delphi. His gifts, which 
<A NAME="337"></A>he sent on recovering from his sickness, were a great bowl of pure silver, 
<A NAME="338"></A>with a salver in steel curiously inlaid, a work among all the offerings 
<A NAME="339"></A>at Delphi the best worth looking at. Glaucus, the Chian, made it, the man 
<A NAME="340"></A>who first invented the art of inlaying steel.
<A NAME="341"></A><BR><BR>On the death of Alyattes, Croesus, his son, who was thirty-five 
<A NAME="342"></A>years old, succeeded to the throne. Of the Greek cities, Ephesus was the 
<A NAME="343"></A>first that he attacked. The Ephesians, when he laid siege to the place, 
<A NAME="344"></A>made an offering of their city to Diana, by stretching a rope from the 
<A NAME="345"></A>town wall to the temple of the goddess, which was distant from the ancient 
<A NAME="346"></A>city, then besieged by Croesus, a space of seven furlongs. They were, as 
<A NAME="347"></A>I said, the first Greeks whom he attacked. Afterwards, on some pretext 
<A NAME="348"></A>or other, he made war in turn upon every Ionian and Aeolian state, bringing 
<A NAME="349"></A>forward, where he could, a substantial ground of complaint; where such 
<A NAME="350"></A>failed him, advancing some poor excuse.
<A NAME="351"></A><BR><BR>In this way he made himself master of all the Greek cities in Asia, 
<A NAME="352"></A>and forced them to become his tributaries; after which he began to think 
<A NAME="353"></A>of building ships, and attacking the islanders. Everything had been got 
<A NAME="354"></A>ready for this purpose, when Bias of Priene (or, as some say, Pittacus 
<A NAME="355"></A>the Mytilenean) put a stop to the project. The king had made inquiry of 
<A NAME="356"></A>this person, who was lately arrived at Sardis, if there were any news from 
<A NAME="357"></A>Greece; to which he answered, "Yes, sire, the islanders are gathering ten 
<A NAME="358"></A>thousand horse, designing an expedition against thee and against thy capital." 
<A NAME="359"></A>Croesus, thinking he spake seriously, broke out, "Ah, might the gods put 
<A NAME="360"></A>such a thought into their minds as to attack the sons of the Lydians with 
<A NAME="361"></A>cavalry!" "It seems, oh! king," rejoined the other, "that thou desirest 
<A NAME="362"></A>earnestly to catch the islanders on horseback upon the mainland,- thou 
<A NAME="363"></A>knowest well what would come of it. But what thinkest thou the islanders 
<A NAME="364"></A>desire better, now that they hear thou art about to build ships and sail 
<A NAME="365"></A>against them, than to catch the Lydians at sea, and there revenge on them 
<A NAME="366"></A>the wrongs of their brothers upon the mainland, whom thou holdest in slavery?" 
<A NAME="367"></A>Croesus was charmed with the turn of the speech; and thinking there was 
<A NAME="368"></A>reason in what was said, gave up his ship-building and concluded a league 
<A NAME="369"></A>of amity with the Ionians of the isles.
<A NAME="370"></A><BR><BR>Croesus afterwards, in the course of many years, brought under 
<A NAME="371"></A>his sway almost all the nations to the west of the Halys. The Lycians and 
<A NAME="372"></A>Cilicians alone continued free; all the other tribes he reduced and held 
<A NAME="373"></A>in subjection. They were the following: the Lydians, Phrygians, Mysians, 
<A NAME="374"></A>Mariandynians, Chalybians, Paphlagonians, Thynian and Bithynian Thracians, 
<A NAME="375"></A>Carians, Ionians, Dorians, Aeolians and Pamphylians.
<A NAME="376"></A><BR><BR>When all these conquests had been added to the Lydian empire, and 
<A NAME="377"></A>the prosperity of Sardis was now at its height, there came thither, one 
<A NAME="378"></A>after another, all the sages of Greece living at the time, and among them 
<A NAME="379"></A>Solon, the Athenian. He was on his travels, having left Athens to be absent 
<A NAME="380"></A>ten years, under the pretence of wishing to see the world, but really to 
<A NAME="381"></A>avoid being forced to repeal any of the laws which, at the request of the 
<A NAME="382"></A>Athenians, he had made for them. Without his sanction the Athenians could 
<A NAME="383"></A>not repeal them, as they had bound themselves under a heavy curse to be 
<A NAME="384"></A>governed for ten years by the laws which should be imposed on them by 
<A NAME="385"></A>Solon.
<A NAME="386"></A><BR><BR>On this account, as well as to see the world, Solon set out upon 
<A NAME="387"></A>his travels, in the course of which he went to Egypt to the court of Amasis, 
<A NAME="388"></A>and also came on a visit to Croesus at Sardis. Croesus received him as 
<A NAME="389"></A>his guest, and lodged him in the royal palace. On the third or fourth day 
<A NAME="390"></A>after, he bade his servants conduct Solon. over his treasuries, and show 
<A NAME="391"></A>him all their greatness and magnificence. When he had seen them all, and, 
<A NAME="392"></A>so far as time allowed, inspected them, Croesus addressed this question 
<A NAME="393"></A>to him. "Stranger of Athens, we have heard much of thy wisdom and of thy 
<A NAME="394"></A>travels through many lands, from love of knowledge and a wish to see the 
<A NAME="395"></A>world. I am curious therefore to inquire of thee, whom, of all the men 
<A NAME="396"></A>that thou hast seen, thou deemest the most happy?" This he asked because 
<A NAME="397"></A>he thought himself the happiest of mortals: but Solon answered him without 
<A NAME="398"></A>flattery, according to his true sentiments, "Tellus of Athens, sire." Full 
<A NAME="399"></A>of astonishment at what he heard, Croesus demanded sharply, "And wherefore 
<A NAME="400"></A>dost thou deem Tellus happiest?" To which the other replied, "First, because 
<A NAME="401"></A>his country was flourishing in his days, and he himself had sons both beautiful 
<A NAME="402"></A>and good, and he lived to see children born to each of them, and these 
<A NAME="403"></A>children all grew up; and further because, after a life spent in what our 
<A NAME="404"></A>people look upon as comfort, his end was surpassingly glorious. In a battle 
<A NAME="405"></A>between the Athenians and their neighbours near Eleusis, he came to the 
<A NAME="406"></A>assistance of his countrymen, routed the foe, and died upon the field most 
<A NAME="407"></A>gallantly. The Athenians gave him a public funeral on the spot where he 
<A NAME="408"></A>fell, and paid him the highest honours."
<A NAME="409"></A><BR><BR>Thus did Solon admonish Croesus by the example of Tellus, enumerating 
<A NAME="410"></A>the manifold particulars of his happiness. When he had ended, Croesus inquired 
<A NAME="411"></A>a second time, who after Tellus seemed to him the happiest, expecting that 
<A NAME="412"></A>at any rate, he would be given the second place. "Cleobis and Bito," Solon 
<A NAME="413"></A>answered; "they were of Argive race; their fortune was enough for their 
<A NAME="414"></A>wants, and they were besides endowed with so much bodily strength that 
<A NAME="415"></A>they had both gained prizes at the Games. Also this tale is told of them:- 
<A NAME="416"></A>There was a great festival in honour of the goddess Juno at Argos, to which 
<A NAME="417"></A>their mother must needs be taken in a car. Now the oxen did not come home 
<A NAME="418"></A>from the field in time: so the youths, fearful of being too late, put the 
<A NAME="419"></A>yoke on their own necks, and themselves drew the car in which their mother 
<A NAME="420"></A>rode. Five and forty furlongs did they draw her, and stopped before the 
<A NAME="421"></A>temple. This deed of theirs was witnessed by the whole assembly of worshippers, 
<A NAME="422"></A>and then their life closed in the best possible way. Herein, too, God showed 
<A NAME="423"></A>forth most evidently, how much better a thing for man death is than life. 
<A NAME="424"></A>For the Argive men, who stood around the car, extolled the vast strength 
<A NAME="425"></A>of the youths; and the Argive women extolled the mother who was blessed 
<A NAME="426"></A>with such a pair of sons; and the mother herself, overjoyed at the deed 
<A NAME="427"></A>and at the praises it had won, standing straight before the image, besought 
<A NAME="428"></A>the goddess to bestow on Cleobis and Bito, the sons who had so mightily 
<A NAME="429"></A>honoured her, the highest blessing to which mortals can attain. Her prayer 
<A NAME="430"></A>ended, they offered sacrifice and partook of the holy banquet, after which 
<A NAME="431"></A>the two youths fell asleep in the temple. They never woke more, but so 
<A NAME="432"></A>passed from the earth. The Argives, looking on them as among the best of 
<A NAME="433"></A>men, caused statues of them to be made, which they gave to the shrine at 
<A NAME="434"></A>Delphi."
<A NAME="435"></A><BR><BR>When Solon had thus assigned these youths the second place, Croesus 
<A NAME="436"></A>broke in angrily, "What, stranger of Athens, is my happiness, then, so 
<A NAME="437"></A>utterly set at nought by thee, that thou dost not even put me on a level 
<A NAME="438"></A>with private men?"
<A NAME="439"></A><BR><BR>"Oh! Croesus," replied the other, "thou askedst a question concerning 
<A NAME="440"></A>the condition of man, of one who knows that the power above us is full 
<A NAME="441"></A>of jealousy, and fond of troubling our lot. A long life gives one to witness 
<A NAME="442"></A>much, and experience much oneself, that one would not choose. Seventy years 
<A NAME="443"></A>I regard as the limit of the life of man. In these seventy years are contained, 
<A NAME="444"></A>without reckoning intercalary months, twenty-five thousand and two hundred 
<A NAME="445"></A>days. Add an intercalary month to every other year, that the seasons may 
<A NAME="446"></A>come round at the right time, and there will be, besides the seventy years, 
<A NAME="447"></A>thirty-five such months, making an addition of one thousand and fifty days. 
<A NAME="448"></A>The whole number of the days contained in the seventy years will thus be 
<A NAME="449"></A>twenty-six thousand two hundred and fifty, whereof not one but will produce 
<A NAME="450"></A>events unlike the rest. Hence man is wholly accident. For thyself, oh! 
<A NAME="451"></A>Croesus, I see that thou art wonderfully rich, and art the lord of many 
<A NAME="452"></A>nations; but with respect to that whereon thou questionest me, I have no 
<A NAME="453"></A>answer to give, until I hear that thou hast closed thy life happily. For 
<A NAME="454"></A>assuredly he who possesses great store of riches is no nearer happiness 
<A NAME="455"></A>than he who has what suffices for his daily needs, unless it so hap that 
<A NAME="456"></A>luck attend upon him, and so he continue in the enjoyment of all his good 
<A NAME="457"></A>things to the end of life. For many of the wealthiest men have been unfavoured 
<A NAME="458"></A>of fortune, and many whose means were moderate have had excellent luck. 
<A NAME="459"></A>Men of the former class excel those of the latter but in two respects; 
<A NAME="460"></A>these last excel the former in many. The wealthy man is better able to 
<A NAME="461"></A>content his desires, and to bear up against a sudden buffet of calamity. 
<A NAME="462"></A>The other has less ability to withstand these evils (from which, however, 
<A NAME="463"></A>his good luck keeps him clear), but he enjoys all these following blessings: 
<A NAME="464"></A>he is whole of limb, a stranger to disease, free from misfortune, happy 
<A NAME="465"></A>in his children, and comely to look upon. If, in addition to all this, 
<A NAME="466"></A>he end his life well, he is of a truth the man of whom thou art in search, 
<A NAME="467"></A>the man who may rightly be termed happy. Call him, however, until he die, 
<A NAME="468"></A>not happy but fortunate. Scarcely, indeed, can any man unite all these 
<A NAME="469"></A>advantages: as there is no country which contains within it all that it 
<A NAME="470"></A>needs, but each, while it possesses some things, lacks others, and the 
<A NAME="471"></A>best country is that which contains the most; so no single human being 
<A NAME="472"></A>is complete in every respect- something is always lacking. He who unites 
<A NAME="473"></A>the greatest number of advantages, and retaining them to the day of his 
<A NAME="474"></A>death, then dies peaceably, that man alone, sire, is, in my judgment, entitled 
<A NAME="475"></A>to bear the name of 'happy.' But in every matter it behoves us to mark 
<A NAME="476"></A>well the end: for oftentimes God gives men a gleam of happiness, and then 
<A NAME="477"></A>plunges them into ruin."
<A NAME="478"></A><BR><BR>Such was the speech which Solon addressed to Croesus, a speech 
<A NAME="479"></A>which brought him neither largess nor honour. The king saw him depart with 
<A NAME="480"></A>much indifference, since he thought that a man must be an arrant fool who 
<A NAME="481"></A>made no account of present good, but bade men always wait and mark the 
<A NAME="482"></A>end.
<A NAME="483"></A><BR><BR>After Solon had gone away a dreadful vengeance, sent of God, came 
<A NAME="484"></A>upon Croesus, to punish him, it is likely, for deeming himself the happiest 
<A NAME="485"></A>of men. First he had a dream in the night, which foreshowed him truly the 
<A NAME="486"></A>evils that were about to befall him in the person of his son. For Croesus 
<A NAME="487"></A>had two sons, one blasted by a natural defect, being deaf and dumb; the 
<A NAME="488"></A>other, distinguished far above all his co-mates in every pursuit. The name 
<A NAME="489"></A>of the last was Atys. It was this son concerning whom he dreamt a dream 
<A NAME="490"></A>that he would die by the blow of an iron weapon. When he woke, he considered 
<A NAME="491"></A>earnestly with himself, and, greatly alarmed at the dream, instantly made 
<A NAME="492"></A>his son take a wife, and whereas in former years the youth had been wont 
<A NAME="493"></A>to command the Lydian forces in the field, he now would not suffer him 
<A NAME="494"></A>to accompany them. All the spears and javelins, and weapons used in the 
<A NAME="495"></A>wars, he removed out of the male apartments, and laid them in heaps in 
<A NAME="496"></A>the chambers of the women, fearing lest perhaps one of the weapons that 
<A NAME="497"></A>hung against the wall might fall and strike him.
<A NAME="498"></A><BR><BR>Now it chanced that while he was making arrangements for the wedding, 
<A NAME="499"></A>there came to Sardis a man under a misfortune, who had upon him the stain 
<A NAME="500"></A>of blood. He was by race a Phrygian, and belonged to the family of the 
<A NAME="501"></A>king. Presenting himself at the palace of Croesus, he prayed to be admitted 
<A NAME="502"></A>to purification according to the customs of the country. Now the Lydian 
<A NAME="503"></A>method of purifying is very nearly the same as the Greek. Croesus granted 
<A NAME="504"></A>the request, and went through all the customary rites, after which he asked 
<A NAME="505"></A>the suppliant of his birth and country, addressing him as follows:- "Who 
<A NAME="506"></A>art thou, stranger, and from what part of Phrygia fleddest thou to take 
<A NAME="507"></A>refuge at my hearth? And whom, moreover, what man or what woman, hast thou 
<A NAME="508"></A>slain?" "Oh! king," replied the Phrygian, "I am the son of Gordias, son 
<A NAME="509"></A>of Midas. I am named Adrastus. The man I unintentionally slew was my own 
<A NAME="510"></A>brother. For this my father drove me from the land, and I lost all. Then 
<A NAME="511"></A>fled I here to thee." "Thou art the offspring," Croesus rejoined, "of a 
<A NAME="512"></A>house friendly to mine, and thou art come to friends. Thou shalt want for 
<A NAME="513"></A>nothing so long as thou abidest in my dominions. Bear thy misfortune as 
<A NAME="514"></A>easily as thou mayest, so will it go best with thee." Thenceforth Adrastus 
<A NAME="515"></A>lived in the palace of the king.
<A NAME="516"></A><BR><BR>It chanced that at this very same time there was in the Mysian 
<A NAME="517"></A>Olympus a huge monster of a boar, which went forth often from this mountain 
<A NAME="518"></A>country, and wasted the corn-fields of the Mysians. Many a time had the 
<A NAME="519"></A>Mysians collected to hunt the beast, but instead of doing him any hurt, 
<A NAME="520"></A>they came off always with some loss to themselves. At length they sent 
<A NAME="521"></A>ambassadors to Croesus, who delivered their message to him in these words: 
<A NAME="522"></A>"Oh! king, a mighty monster of a boar has appeared in our parts, and destroys 
<A NAME="523"></A>the labour of our hands. We do our best to take him, but in vain. Now therefore 
<A NAME="524"></A>we beseech thee to let thy son accompany us back, with some chosen youths 
<A NAME="525"></A>and hounds, that we may rid our country of the animal." Such was the tenor 
<A NAME="526"></A>of their prayer.
<A NAME="527"></A><BR><BR>But Croesus bethought him of his dream, and answered, "Say no more 
<A NAME="528"></A>of my son going with you; that may not be in any wise. He is but just joined 
<A NAME="529"></A>in wedlock, and is busy enough with that. I will grant you a picked band 
<A NAME="530"></A>of Lydians, and all my huntsmen and hounds; and I will charge those whom 
<A NAME="531"></A>I send to use all zeal in aiding you to rid your country of the 
<A NAME="532"></A>brute."
<A NAME="533"></A><BR><BR>With this reply the Mysians were content; but the king's son, hearing 
<A NAME="534"></A>what the prayer of the Mysians was, came suddenly in, and on the refusal 
<A NAME="535"></A>of Croesus to let him go with them, thus addressed his father: "Formerly, 
<A NAME="536"></A>my father, it was deemed the noblest and most suitable thing for me to 
<A NAME="537"></A>frequent the wars and hunting-parties, and win myself glory in them; but 
<A NAME="538"></A>now thou keepest me away from both, although thou hast never beheld in 
<A NAME="539"></A>me either cowardice or lack of spirit. What face meanwhile must I wear 
<A NAME="540"></A>as I walk to the forum or return from it? What must the citizens, what 
<A NAME="541"></A>must my young bride think of me? What sort of man will she suppose her 
<A NAME="542"></A>husband to be? Either, therefore, let me go to the chase of this boar, 
<A NAME="543"></A>or give me a reason why it is best for me to do according to thy 
<A NAME="544"></A>wishes."
<A NAME="545"></A><BR><BR>Then Croesus answered, "My son, it is not because I have seen in 
<A NAME="546"></A>thee either cowardice or aught else which has displeased me that I keep 
<A NAME="547"></A>thee back; but because a vision which came before me in a dream as I slept, 
<A NAME="548"></A>warned me that thou wert doomed to die young, pierced by an iron weapon. 
<A NAME="549"></A>It was this which first led me to hasten on thy wedding, and now it hinders 
<A NAME="550"></A>me from sending thee upon this enterprise. Fain would I keep watch over 
<A NAME="551"></A>thee, if by any means I may cheat fate of thee during my own lifetime. 
<A NAME="552"></A>For thou art the one and only son that I possess; the other, whose hearing 
<A NAME="553"></A>is destroyed, I regard as if he were not."
<A NAME="554"></A><BR><BR>"Ah! father," returned the youth, "I blame thee not for keeping 
<A NAME="555"></A>watch over me after a dream so terrible; but if thou mistakest, if thou 
<A NAME="556"></A>dost not apprehend the dream aright, 'tis no blame for me to show thee 
<A NAME="557"></A>wherein thou errest. Now the dream, thou saidst thyself, foretold that 
<A NAME="558"></A>I should die stricken by an iron weapon. But what hands has a boar to strike 
<A NAME="559"></A>with? What iron weapon does he wield? Yet this is what thou fearest for 
<A NAME="560"></A>me. Had the dream said that I should die pierced by a tusk, then thou hadst 
<A NAME="561"></A>done well to keep me away; but it said a weapon. Now here we do not combat 
<A NAME="562"></A>men, but a wild animal. I pray thee, therefore, let me go with 
<A NAME="563"></A>them."
<A NAME="564"></A><BR><BR>"There thou hast me, my son," said Croesus, "thy interpretation 
<A NAME="565"></A>is better than mine. I yield to it, and change my mind, and consent to 
<A NAME="566"></A>let thee go."
<A NAME="567"></A><BR><BR>Then the king sent for Adrastus, the Phrygian, and said to him, 
<A NAME="568"></A>"Adrastus, when thou wert smitten with the rod of affliction- no reproach, 
<A NAME="569"></A>my friend- I purified thee, and have taken thee to live with me in my palace, 
<A NAME="570"></A>and have been at every charge. Now, therefore, it behoves thee to requite 
<A NAME="571"></A>the good offices which thou hast received at my hands by consenting to 
<A NAME="572"></A>go with my son on this hunting party, and to watch over him, if perchance 
<A NAME="573"></A>you should be attacked upon the road by some band of daring robbers. Even 
<A NAME="574"></A>apart from this, it were right for thee to go where thou mayest make thyself 
<A NAME="575"></A>famous by noble deeds. They are the heritage of thy family, and thou too 
<A NAME="576"></A>art so stalwart and strong."
<A NAME="577"></A><BR><BR>Adrastus answered, "Except for thy request, Oh! king, I would rather 
<A NAME="578"></A>have kept away from this hunt; for methinks it ill beseems a man under 
<A NAME="579"></A>a misfortune such as mine to consort with his happier compeers; and besides, 
<A NAME="580"></A>I have no heart to it. On many grounds I had stayed behind; but, as thou 
<A NAME="581"></A>urgest it, and I am bound to pleasure thee (for truly it does behove me 
<A NAME="582"></A>to requite thy good offices), I am content to do as thou wishest. For thy 
<A NAME="583"></A>son, whom thou givest into my charge, be sure thou shalt receive him back 
<A NAME="584"></A>safe and sound, so far as depends upon a guardian's 
<A NAME="585"></A>carefulness."
<A NAME="586"></A><BR><BR>Thus assured, Croesus let them depart, accompanied by a band of 
<A NAME="587"></A>picked youths, and well provided with dogs of chase. When they reached 
<A NAME="588"></A>Olympus, they scattered in quest of the animal; he was soon found, and 
<A NAME="589"></A>the hunters, drawing round him in a circle, hurled their weapons at him. 
<A NAME="590"></A>Then the stranger, the man who had been purified of blood, whose name was 
<A NAME="591"></A>Adrastus, he also hurled his spear at the boar, but missed his aim, and 
<A NAME="592"></A>struck Atys. Thus was the son of Croesus slain by the point of an iron 
<A NAME="593"></A>weapon, and the warning of the vision was fulfilled. Then one ran to Sardis 
<A NAME="594"></A>to bear the tidings to the king, and he came and informed him of the combat 
<A NAME="595"></A>and of the fate that had befallen his son.
<A NAME="596"></A><BR><BR>If it was a heavy blow to the father to learn that his child was 
<A NAME="597"></A>dead, it yet more strongly affected him to think that the very man whom 
<A NAME="598"></A>he himself once purified had done the deed. In the violence of his grief 
<A NAME="599"></A>he called aloud on Jupiter Catharsius to be a witness of what he had suffered 
<A NAME="600"></A>at the stranger's hands. Afterwards he invoked the same god as Jupiter 
<A NAME="601"></A>Ephistius and Hetaereus- using the one term because he had unwittingly 
<A NAME="602"></A>harboured in his house the man who had now slain his son; and the other, 
<A NAME="603"></A>because the stranger, who had been sent as his child's guardian, had turned 
<A NAME="604"></A>out his most cruel enemy.
<A NAME="605"></A><BR><BR>Presently the Lydians arrived, bearing the body of the youth, and 
<A NAME="606"></A>behind them followed the homicide. He took his stand in front of the corse, 
<A NAME="607"></A>and, stretching forth his hands to Croesus, delivered himself into his 
<A NAME="608"></A>power with earnest entreaties that he would sacrifice him upon the body 
<A NAME="609"></A>of his son- "his former misfortune was burthen enough; now that he had 
<A NAME="610"></A>added to it a second, and had brought ruin on the man who purified him, 
<A NAME="611"></A>he could not bear to live." Then Croesus, when he heard these words, was 
<A NAME="612"></A>moved with pity towards Adrastus, notwithstanding the bitterness of his 
<A NAME="613"></A>own calamity; and so he answered, "Enough, my friend; I have all the revenge 
<A NAME="614"></A>that I require, since thou givest sentence of death against thyself. But 
<A NAME="615"></A>in sooth it is not thou who hast injured me, except so far as thou hast 
<A NAME="616"></A>unwittingly dealt the blow. Some god is the author of my misfortune, and 
<A NAME="617"></A>I was forewarned of it a long time ago." Croesus after this buried the 
<A NAME="618"></A>body of his son, with such honours as befitted the occasion. Adrastus, 
<A NAME="619"></A>son of Gordias, son of Midas, the destroyer of his brother in time past, 
<A NAME="620"></A>the destroyer now of his purifier, regarding himself as the most unfortunate 
<A NAME="621"></A>wretch whom he had ever known, so soon as all was quiet about the place, 
<A NAME="622"></A>slew himself upon the tomb. Croesus, bereft of his son, gave himself up 
<A NAME="623"></A>to mourning for two full years.
<A NAME="624"></A><BR><BR>At the end of this time the grief of Croesus was interrupted by 
<A NAME="625"></A>intelligence from abroad. He learnt that Cyrus, the son of Cambyses, had 
<A NAME="626"></A>destroyed the empire of Astyages, the son of Cyaxares; and that the Persians 
<A NAME="627"></A>were becoming daily more powerful. This led him to consider with himself 
<A NAME="628"></A>whether it were possible to check the growing power of that people before 
<A NAME="629"></A>it came to a head. With this design he resolved to make instant trial of 
<A NAME="630"></A>the several oracles in Greece, and of the one in Libya. So he sent his 
<A NAME="631"></A>messengers in different directions, some to Delphi, some to Abae in Phocis, 
<A NAME="632"></A>and some to Dodona; others to the oracle of Amphiaraus; others to that 
<A NAME="633"></A>of Trophonius; others, again, to Branchidae in Milesia. These were the 
<A NAME="634"></A>Greek oracles which he consulted. To Libya he sent another embassy, to 
<A NAME="635"></A>consult the oracle of Ammon. These messengers were sent to test the knowledge 
<A NAME="636"></A>of the oracles, that, if they were found really to return true answers, 
<A NAME="637"></A>he might send a second time, and inquire if he ought to attack the 
<A NAME="638"></A>Persians.
<A NAME="639"></A><BR><BR>The messengers who were despatched to make trial of the oracles 
<A NAME="640"></A>were given the following instructions: they were to keep count of the days 
<A NAME="641"></A>from the time of their leaving Sardis, and, reckoning from that date, on 
<A NAME="642"></A>the hundredth day they were to consult the oracles, and to inquire of them 
<A NAME="643"></A>what Croesus the son of Alyattes, king of Lydia, was doing at that moment. 
<A NAME="644"></A>The answers given them were to be taken down in writing, and brought back 
<A NAME="645"></A>to him. None of the replies remain on record except that of the oracle 
<A NAME="646"></A>at Delphi. There, the moment that the Lydians entered the sanctuary, and 
<A NAME="647"></A>before they put their questions, the Pythoness thus answered them in hexameter 
<A NAME="648"></A>verse:-
<A NAME="649"></A><BR><BR>I can count the sands, and I can measure the 
<A NAME="650"></A>ocean;
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>I have ears for the silent, and know what the dumb man 
<A NAME="652"></A>meaneth;
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>Lo! on my sense there striketh the smell of a shell-covered
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>tortoise,
<A NAME="655"></A><BR>Boiling now on a fire, with the flesh of a lamb, in a 
<A NAME="656"></A>cauldron-
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>Brass is the vessel below, and brass the cover above 
<A NAME="658"></A>it.
<A NAME="659"></A><BR><BR>These words the Lydians wrote down at the mouth of the Pythoness 
<A NAME="660"></A>as she prophesied, and then set off on their return to Sardis. When all 
<A NAME="661"></A>the messengers had come back with the answers which they had received, 
<A NAME="662"></A>Croesus undid the rolls, and read what was written in each. Only one approved 
<A NAME="663"></A>itself to him, that of the Delphic oracle. This he had no sooner heard 
<A NAME="664"></A>than he instantly made an act of adoration, and accepted it as true, declaring 
<A NAME="665"></A>that the Delphic was the only really oracular shrine, the only one that 
<A NAME="666"></A>had discovered in what way he was in fact employed. For on the departure 
<A NAME="667"></A>of his messengers he had set himself to think what was most impossible 
<A NAME="668"></A>for any one to conceive of his doing, and then, waiting till the day agreed 
<A NAME="669"></A>on came, he acted as he had determined. He took a tortoise and a lamb, 
<A NAME="670"></A>and cutting them in pieces with his own hands, boiled them both together 
<A NAME="671"></A>in a brazen cauldron, covered over with a lid which was also of 
<A NAME="672"></A>brass.
<A NAME="673"></A><BR><BR>Such then was the answer returned to Croesus from Delphi. What 
<A NAME="674"></A>the answer was which the Lydians who went to the shrine of Amphiarans and 
<A NAME="675"></A>performed the customary rites obtained of the oracle there, I have it not 
<A NAME="676"></A>in my power to mention, for there is no record of it. All that is known 
<A NAME="677"></A>is that Croesus believed himself to have found there also an oracle which 
<A NAME="678"></A>spoke the truth.
<A NAME="679"></A><BR><BR>After this Croesus, having resolved to propitiate the Delphic god 
<A NAME="680"></A>with a magnificent sacrifice, offered up three thousand of every kind of 
<A NAME="681"></A>sacrificial beast, and besides made a huge pile, and placed upon it couches 
<A NAME="682"></A>coated with silver and with gold, and golden goblets, and robes and vests 
<A NAME="683"></A>of purple; all which he burnt in the hope of thereby making himself more 
<A NAME="684"></A>secure of the favour of the god. Further he issued his orders to all the 
<A NAME="685"></A>people of the land to offer a sacrifice according to their means. When 
<A NAME="686"></A>the sacrifice was ended, the king melted down a vast quantity of gold, 
<A NAME="687"></A>and ran it into ingots, making them six palms long, three palms broad, 
<A NAME="688"></A>and one palm in thickness. The number of ingots was a hundred and seventeen, 
<A NAME="689"></A>four being of refined gold, in weight two talents and a half; the others 
<A NAME="690"></A>of pale gold, and in weight two talents. He also caused a statue of a lion 
<A NAME="691"></A>to be made in refined gold, the weight of which was ten talents. At the 
<A NAME="692"></A>time when the temple of Delphi was burnt to the ground, this lion fell 
<A NAME="693"></A>from the ingots on which it was placed; it now stands in the Corinthian 
<A NAME="694"></A>treasury, and weighs only six talents and a half, having lost three talents 
<A NAME="695"></A>and a half by the fire.
<A NAME="696"></A><BR><BR>On the completion of these works Croesus sent them away to Delphi, 
<A NAME="697"></A>and with them two bowls of an enormous size, one of gold, the other of 
<A NAME="698"></A>silver, which used to stand, the latter upon the right, the former upon 
<A NAME="699"></A>the left, as one entered the temple. They too were moved at the time of 
<A NAME="700"></A>the fire; and now the golden one is in the Clazomenian treasury, and weighs 
<A NAME="701"></A>eight talents and forty-two minae; the silver one stands in the corner 
<A NAME="702"></A>of the ante-chapel, and holds six hundred amphorae. This is known because 
<A NAME="703"></A>the Delphians fill it at the time of the Theophania. It is said by the 
<A NAME="704"></A>Delphians to be a work of Theodore the Samian, and I think that they say 
<A NAME="705"></A>true, for assuredly it is the work of no common artist. Croesus sent also 
<A NAME="706"></A>four silver casks, which are in the Corinthian treasury, and two lustral 
<A NAME="707"></A>vases, a golden and a silver one. On the former is inscribed the name of 
<A NAME="708"></A>the Lacedaemonians, and they claim it as a gift of theirs, but wrongly, 
<A NAME="709"></A>since it was really given by Croesus. The inscription upon it was cut by 
<A NAME="710"></A>a Delphian, who wished to pleasure the Lacedaemonians. His name is known 
<A NAME="711"></A>to me, but I forbear to mention it. The boy, through whose hand the water 
<A NAME="712"></A>runs, is (I confess) a Lacedaemonian gift, but they did not give either 
<A NAME="713"></A>of the lustral vases. Besides these various offerings, Croesus sent to 
<A NAME="714"></A>Delphi many others of less account, among the rest a number of round silver 
<A NAME="715"></A>basins. Also he dedicated a female figure in gold, three cubits high, which 
<A NAME="716"></A>is said by the Delphians to be the statue of his baking-woman; and further, 
<A NAME="717"></A>he presented the necklace and the girdles of his wife.
<A NAME="718"></A><BR><BR>These were the offerings sent by Croesus to Delphi. To the shrine 
<A NAME="719"></A>of Amphiaraus, with whose valour and misfortune he was acquainted, he sent 
<A NAME="720"></A>a shield entirely of gold, and a spear, also of solid gold, both head and 
<A NAME="721"></A>shaft. They were still existing in my day at Thebes, laid up in the temple 
<A NAME="722"></A>of Ismenian Apollo.
<A NAME="723"></A><BR><BR>The messengers who had the charge of conveying these treasures 
<A NAME="724"></A>to the shrines, received instructions to ask the oracles whether Croesus 
<A NAME="725"></A>should go to war with the Persians and if so, whether he should strengthen 
<A NAME="726"></A>himself by the forces of an ally. Accordingly, when they had reached their 
<A NAME="727"></A>destinations and presented the gifts, they proceeded to consult the oracles 
<A NAME="728"></A>in the following terms:- "Croesus, of Lydia and other countries, believing 
<A NAME="729"></A>that these are the only real oracles in all the world, has sent you such 
<A NAME="730"></A>presents as your discoveries deserved, and now inquires of you whether 
<A NAME="731"></A>he shall go to war with the Persians, and if so, whether he shall strengthen 
<A NAME="732"></A>himself by the forces of a confederate." Both the oracles agreed in the 
<A NAME="733"></A>tenor of their reply, which was in each case a prophecy that if Croesus 
<A NAME="734"></A>attacked the Persians, he would destroy a mighty empire, and a recommendation 
<A NAME="735"></A>to him to look and see who were the most powerful of the Greeks, and to 
<A NAME="736"></A>make alliance with them.
<A NAME="737"></A><BR><BR>At the receipt of these oracular replies Croesus was overjoyed, 
<A NAME="738"></A>and feeling sure now that he would destroy the empire of the Persians, 
<A NAME="739"></A>he sent once more to Pytho, and presented to the Delphians, the number 
<A NAME="740"></A>of whom he had ascertained, two gold staters apiece. In return for this 
<A NAME="741"></A>the Delphians granted to Croesus and the Lydians the privilege of precedency 
<A NAME="742"></A>in consulting the oracle, exemption from all charges, the most honourable 
<A NAME="743"></A>seat at the festivals, and the perpetual right of becoming at pleasure 
<A NAME="744"></A>citizens of their town.
<A NAME="745"></A><BR><BR>After sending these presents to the Delphians, Croesus a third 
<A NAME="746"></A>time consulted the oracle, for having once proved its truthfulness, he 
<A NAME="747"></A>wished to make constant use of it. The question whereto he now desired 
<A NAME="748"></A>an answer was- "Whether his kingdom would be of long duration?" The following 
<A NAME="749"></A>was the reply of the Pythoness:-
<A NAME="750"></A><BR><BR>Wait till the time shall come when a mule is monarch of 
<A NAME="751"></A>Media;
<A NAME="752"></A><BR>Then, thou delicate Lydian, away to the pebbles of 
<A NAME="753"></A>Hermus;
<A NAME="754"></A><BR>Haste, oh! haste thee away, nor blush to behave like a 
<A NAME="755"></A>coward.
<A NAME="756"></A><BR><BR>Of all the answers that had reached him, this pleased him far the 
<A NAME="757"></A>best, for it seemed incredible that a mule should ever come to be king 
<A NAME="758"></A>of the Medes, and so he concluded that the sovereignty would never depart 
<A NAME="759"></A>from himself or his seed after him. Afterwards he turned his thoughts to 
<A NAME="760"></A>the alliance which he had been recommended to contract, and sought to ascertain 
<A NAME="761"></A>by inquiry which was the most powerful of the Grecian states. His inquiries 
<A NAME="762"></A>pointed out to him two states as pre-eminent above the rest. These were 
<A NAME="763"></A>the Lacedaemonians and the Athenians, the former of Doric, the latter of 
<A NAME="764"></A>Ionic blood. And indeed these two nations had held from very, early times 
<A NAME="765"></A>the most distinguished place in Greece, the being a Pelasgic, the other 
<A NAME="766"></A>a Hellenic people, and the one having never quitted its original seats, 
<A NAME="767"></A>while the other had been excessively migratory; for during the reign of 
<A NAME="768"></A>Deucalion, Phthiotis was the country in which the Hellenes dwelt, but under 
<A NAME="769"></A>Dorus, the son of Hellen, they moved to the tract at the base of Ossa and 
<A NAME="770"></A>Olympus, which is called Histiaeotis; forced to retire from that region 
<A NAME="771"></A>by the Cadmeians, they settled, under the name of Macedni, in the chain 
<A NAME="772"></A>of Pindus. Hence they once more removed and came to Dryopis; and from Dryopis 
<A NAME="773"></A>having entered the Peloponnese in this way, they became known as 
<A NAME="774"></A>Dorians.
<A NAME="775"></A><BR><BR>What the language of the Pelasgi was I cannot say with any certainty. 
<A NAME="776"></A>If, however, we may form a conjecture from the tongue spoken by the Pelasgi 
<A NAME="777"></A>of the present day- those, for instance, who live at Creston above the 
<A NAME="778"></A>Tyrrhenians, who formerly dwelt in the district named Thessaliotis, and 
<A NAME="779"></A>were neighbours of the people now called the Dorians- or those again who 
<A NAME="780"></A>founded Placia and Scylace upon the Hellespont, who had previously dwelt 
<A NAME="781"></A>for some time with the Athenians- or those, in short, of any other of the 
<A NAME="782"></A>cities which have dropped the name but are in fact Pelasgian; if, I say, 
<A NAME="783"></A>we are to form a conjecture from any of these, we must pronounce that the 
<A NAME="784"></A>Pelasgi spoke a barbarous language. If this were really so, and the entire 
<A NAME="785"></A>Pelasgic race spoke the same tongue, the Athenians, who were certainly 
<A NAME="786"></A>Pelasgi, must have changed their language at the same time that they passed 
<A NAME="787"></A>into the Hellenic body; for it is a certain fact that the people of Creston 
<A NAME="788"></A>speak a language unlike any of their neighbours, and the same is true of 
<A NAME="789"></A>the Placianians, while the language spoken by these two people is the same; 
<A NAME="790"></A>which shows that they both retain the idiom which they brought with them 
<A NAME="791"></A>into the countries where they are now settled.
<A NAME="792"></A><BR><BR>The Hellenic race has never, since its first origin, changed its 
<A NAME="793"></A>speech. This at least seems evident to me. It was a branch of the Pelasgic, 
<A NAME="794"></A>which separated from the main body, and at first was scanty in numbers 
<A NAME="795"></A>and of little power; but it gradually spread and increased to a multitude 
<A NAME="796"></A>of nations, chiefly by the voluntary entrance into its ranks of numerous 
<A NAME="797"></A>tribes of barbarians. The Pelasgi, on the other hand, were, as I think, 
<A NAME="798"></A>a barbarian race which never greatly multiplied.
<A NAME="799"></A><BR><BR>On inquiring into the condition of these two nations, Croesus found 
<A NAME="800"></A>that one, the Athenian, was in a state of grievous oppression and distraction 
<A NAME="801"></A>under Pisistratus, the son of Hippocrates, who was at that time tyrant 
<A NAME="802"></A>of Athens. Hippocrates, when he was a private citizen, is said to have 
<A NAME="803"></A>gone once upon a time to Olympia to see the Games, when a wonderful prodigy 
<A NAME="804"></A>happened to him. As he was employed in sacrificing, the cauldrons which 
<A NAME="805"></A>stood near, full of water and of the flesh of the victims, began to boil 
<A NAME="806"></A>without the help of fire, so that the water overflowed the pots. Chilon 
<A NAME="807"></A>the Lacedaemonian, who happened to be there and to witness the prodigy, 
<A NAME="808"></A>advised Hippocrates, if he were unmarried, never to take into his house 
<A NAME="809"></A>a wife who could bear him a child; if he already had one, to send her back 
<A NAME="810"></A>to her friends; if he had a son, to disown him. Chilon's advice did not 
<A NAME="811"></A>at all please Hippocrates, who disregarded it, and some time after became 
<A NAME="812"></A>the father of Pisistratus. This Pisistratus, at a time when there was civil 
<A NAME="813"></A>contention in Attica between the party of the Sea-coast headed by Megacles 
<A NAME="814"></A>the son of Alcmaeon, and that of the Plain headed by Lycurgus, one of the 
<A NAME="815"></A>Aristolaids, formed the project of making himself tyrant, and with this 
<A NAME="816"></A>view created a third party. Gathering together a band of partisans, and 
<A NAME="817"></A>giving himself out for the protector of the Highlanders, he contrived the 
<A NAME="818"></A>following stratagem. He wounded himself and his mules, and then drove his 
<A NAME="819"></A>chariot into the market-place, professing to have just escaped an attack 
<A NAME="820"></A>of his enemies, who had attempted his life as he was on his way into the 
<A NAME="821"></A>country. He besought the people to assign him a guard to protect his person, 
<A NAME="822"></A>reminding them of the glory which he had gained when he led the attack 
<A NAME="823"></A>upon the Megarians, and took the town of Nisaea, at the same time performing 
<A NAME="824"></A>many other exploits. The Athenians, deceived by his story, appointed him 
<A NAME="825"></A>a band of citizens to serve as a guard, who were to carry clubs instead 
<A NAME="826"></A>of spears, and to accompany him wherever he went. Thus strengthened, Pisistratus 
<A NAME="827"></A>broke into revolt and seized the citadel. In this way he acquired the sovereignty 
<A NAME="828"></A>of Athens, which he continued to hold without disturbing the previously 
<A NAME="829"></A>existing offices or altering any of the laws. He administered the state 
<A NAME="830"></A>according to the established usages, and his arrangements were wise and 
<A NAME="831"></A>salutary.
<A NAME="832"></A><BR><BR>However, after a little time, the partisans of Megacles and those 
<A NAME="833"></A>of Lycurgus agreed to forget their differences, and united to drive him 
<A NAME="834"></A>out. So Pisistratus, having by the means described first made himself master 
<A NAME="835"></A>of Athens, lost his power again before it had time to take root. No sooner, 
<A NAME="836"></A>however, was he departed than the factions which had driven him out quarrelled 
<A NAME="837"></A>anew, and at last Megacles, wearied with the struggle, sent a herald to 
<A NAME="838"></A>Pisistratus, with an offer to re-establish him on the throne if he would 
<A NAME="839"></A>marry his daughter. Pisistratus consented, and on these terms an agreement 
<A NAME="840"></A>was concluded between the two, after which they proceeded to devise the 
<A NAME="841"></A>mode of his restoration. And here the device on which they hit was the 
<A NAME="842"></A>silliest that I find on record, more especially considering that the Greeks 
<A NAME="843"></A>have been from very ancient times distinguished from the barbarians by 
<A NAME="844"></A>superior sagacity and freedom from foolish simpleness, and remembering 
<A NAME="845"></A>that the persons on whom this trick was played were not only Greeks but 
<A NAME="846"></A>Athenians, who have the credit of surpassing all other Greeks in cleverness. 
<A NAME="847"></A>There was in the Paeanian district a woman named Phya, whose height only 
<A NAME="848"></A>fell short of four cubits by three fingers' breadth, and who was altogether 
<A NAME="849"></A>comely to look upon. This woman they clothed in complete armour, and, instructing 
<A NAME="850"></A>her as to the carriage which she was to maintain in order to beseem her 
<A NAME="851"></A>part, they placed her in a chariot and drove to the city. Heralds had been 
<A NAME="852"></A>sent forward to precede her, and to make proclamation to this effect: "Citizens 
<A NAME="853"></A>of Athens, receive again Pisistratus with friendly minds. Minerva, who 
<A NAME="854"></A>of all men honours him the most, herself conducts him back to her own citadel." 
<A NAME="855"></A>This they proclaimed in all directions, and immediately the rumour spread 
<A NAME="856"></A>throughout the country districts that Minerva was bringing back her favourite. 
<A NAME="857"></A>They of the city also, fully persuaded that the woman was the veritable 
<A NAME="858"></A>goddess, prostrated themselves before her, and received Pisistratus 
<A NAME="859"></A>back.
<A NAME="860"></A><BR><BR>Pisistratus, having thus recovered the sovereignty, married, according 
<A NAME="861"></A>to agreement, the daughter of Megacles. As, however, he had already a family 
<A NAME="862"></A>of grown up sons, and the Alcmaeonidae were supposed to be under a curse, 
<A NAME="863"></A>he determined that there should be no issue of the marriage. His wife at 
<A NAME="864"></A>first kept this matter to herself, but after a time, either her mother 
<A NAME="865"></A>questioned her, or it may be that she told it of her own accord. At any 
<A NAME="866"></A>rate, she informed her mother, and so it reached her father's ears. Megacles, 
<A NAME="867"></A>indignant at receiving an affront from such a quarter, in his anger instantly 
<A NAME="868"></A>made up his differences with the opposite faction, on which Pisistratus, 
<A NAME="869"></A>aware of what was planning against him, took himself out of the country. 
<A NAME="870"></A>Arrived at Eretria, he held a council with his children to decide what 
<A NAME="871"></A>was to be done. The opinion of Hippias prevailed, and it was agreed to 
<A NAME="872"></A>aim at regaining the sovereignty. The first step was to obtain advances 
<A NAME="873"></A>of money from such states as were under obligations to them. By these means 
<A NAME="874"></A>they collected large sums from several countries, especially from the Thebans, 
<A NAME="875"></A>who gave them far more than any of the rest. To be brief, time passed, 
<A NAME="876"></A>and all was at length got ready for their return. A band of Argive mercenaries 
<A NAME="877"></A>arrived from the Peloponnese, and a certain Naxian named Lygdamis, who 
<A NAME="878"></A>volunteered his services, was particularly zealous in the cause, supplying 
<A NAME="879"></A>both men and money.
<A NAME="880"></A><BR><BR>In the eleventh year of their exile the family of Pisistratus set 
<A NAME="881"></A>sail from Eretria on their return home. They made the coast of Attica, 
<A NAME="882"></A>near Marathon, where they encamped, and were joined by their partisans 
<A NAME="883"></A>from the capital and by numbers from the country districts, who loved tyranny 
<A NAME="884"></A>better than freedom. At Athens, while Pisistratus was obtaining funds, 
<A NAME="885"></A>and even after he landed at Marathon, no one paid any attention to his 
<A NAME="886"></A>proceedings. When, however, it became known that he had left Marathon, 
<A NAME="887"></A>and was marching upon the city, preparations were made for resistance, 
<A NAME="888"></A>the whole force of the state was levied, and led against the returning 
<A NAME="889"></A>exiles. Meantime the army of Pisistratus, which had broken up from Marathon, 
<A NAME="890"></A>meeting their adversaries near the temple of the Pallenian Minerva, pitched 
<A NAME="891"></A>their camp opposite them. Here a certain soothsayer, Amphilytus by name, 
<A NAME="892"></A>an Acarnanian, moved by a divine impulse, came into the presence of Pisistratus, 
<A NAME="893"></A>and approaching him uttered this prophecy in the hexameter 
<A NAME="894"></A>measure:-
<A NAME="895"></A><BR><BR>Now has the cast been made, the net is out-spread in the 
<A NAME="896"></A>water,
<A NAME="897"></A><BR>Through the moonshiny night the tunnies will enter the 
<A NAME="898"></A>meshes.
<A NAME="899"></A><BR><BR>Such was the prophecy uttered under a divine inspiration. Pisistratus, 
<A NAME="900"></A>apprehending its meaning, declared that he accepted the oracle, and instantly 
<A NAME="901"></A>led on his army. The Athenians from the city had just finished their midday 
<A NAME="902"></A>meal, after which they had betaken themselves, some to dice, others to 
<A NAME="903"></A>sleep, when Pisistratus with his troops fell upon them and put them to 
<A NAME="904"></A>the rout. As soon as the flight began, Pisistratus bethought himself of 
<A NAME="905"></A>a most wise contrivance, whereby the might be induced to disperse and not 
<A NAME="906"></A>unite in a body any more. He mounted his sons on horseback and sent them 
<A NAME="907"></A>on in front to overtake the fugitives, and exhort them to be of good cheer, 
<A NAME="908"></A>and return each man to his home. The Athenians took the advice, and Pisistratus 
<A NAME="909"></A>became for the third time master of Athens.
<A NAME="910"></A><BR><BR>Upon this he set himself to root his power more firmly, by the 
<A NAME="911"></A>aid of a numerous body of mercenaries, and by keeping up a full exchequer, 
<A NAME="912"></A>partly supplied from native sources, partly from the countries about the 
<A NAME="913"></A>river Strymon. He also demanded hostages from many of the Athenians who 
<A NAME="914"></A>had remained at home, and not left Athens at his approach; and these he 
<A NAME="915"></A>sent to Naxos, which he had conquered by force of arms, and given over 
<A NAME="916"></A>into the charge of Lygdamis. Farther, he purified the island of Delos, 
<A NAME="917"></A>according to the injunctions of an oracle, after the following fashion. 
<A NAME="918"></A>All the dead bodies which had been interred within sight of the temple 
<A NAME="919"></A>he dug up, and removed to another part of the isle. Thus was the tyranny 
<A NAME="920"></A>of Pisistratus established at Athens, many of the Athenians having fallen 
<A NAME="921"></A>in the battle, and many others having fled the country together with the 
<A NAME="922"></A>son of Alcmaeon.
<A NAME="923"></A><BR><BR>Such was the condition of the Athenians when Croesus made inquiry 
<A NAME="924"></A>concerning them. Proceeding to seek information concerning the Lacedaemonians, 
<A NAME="925"></A>he learnt that, after passing through a period of great depression, they 
<A NAME="926"></A>had lately been victorious in a war with the people of Tegea; for, during 
<A NAME="927"></A>the joint reign of Leo and Agasicles, kings of Sparta, the Lacedaemonians, 
<A NAME="928"></A>successful in all their other wars, suffered continual defeat at the hands 
<A NAME="929"></A>of the Tegeans. At a still earlier period they had been the very worst 
<A NAME="930"></A>governed people in Greece, as well in matters of internal management as 
<A NAME="931"></A>in their relations towards foreigners, from whom they kept entirely aloof. 
<A NAME="932"></A>The circumstances which led to their being well governed were the following:- 
<A NAME="933"></A>Lycurgus, a man of distinction among the Spartans, had gone to Delphi, 
<A NAME="934"></A>to visit the oracle. Scarcely had he entered into the inner fane, when 
<A NAME="935"></A>the Pythoness exclaimed aloud,
<A NAME="936"></A><BR><BR>Oh! thou great Lycurgus, that com'st to my beautiful 
<A NAME="937"></A>dwelling,
<A NAME="938"></A><BR>Dear to love, and to all who sit in the halls of 
<A NAME="939"></A>Olympus,
<A NAME="940"></A><BR>Whether to hail thee a god I know not, or only a 
<A NAME="941"></A>mortal,
<A NAME="942"></A><BR>But my hope is strong that a god thou wilt prove, Lycurgus. Some report 
<A NAME="943"></A>besides, that the Pythoness delivered to him the entire system of laws 
<A NAME="944"></A>which are still observed by the Spartans. The Lacedaemonians, however. 
<A NAME="945"></A>themselves assert that Lycurgus, when he was guardian of his nephew, Labotas, 
<A NAME="946"></A>king of Sparta, and regent in his room, introduced them from Crete; for 
<A NAME="947"></A>as soon as he became regent, he altered the whole of the existing customs, 
<A NAME="948"></A>substituting new ones, which he took care should be observed by all. After 
<A NAME="949"></A>this he arranged whatever appertained to war, establishing the Enomotiae, 
<A NAME="950"></A>Triacades, and Syssitia, besides which he instituted the senate,' and the 
<A NAME="951"></A>ephoralty. Such was the way in which the Lacedaemonians became a well-governed 
<A NAME="952"></A>people.
<A NAME="953"></A><BR><BR>On the death of Lycurgus they built him a temple, and ever since 
<A NAME="954"></A>they have worshipped him with the utmost reverence. Their soil being good 
<A NAME="955"></A>and the population numerous, they sprang up rapidly to power, and became 
<A NAME="956"></A>a flourishing people. In consequence they soon ceased to be satisfied to 
<A NAME="957"></A>stay quiet; and, regarding the Arcadians as very much their inferiors, 
<A NAME="958"></A>they sent to consult the oracle about conquering the whole of Arcadia. 
<A NAME="959"></A>The Pythoness thus answered them:
<A NAME="960"></A><BR><BR>Cravest thou Arcady? Bold is thy craving. I shall not content 
<A NAME="961"></A>it.
<A NAME="962"></A><BR>Many the men that in Arcady dwell, whose food is the 
<A NAME="963"></A>acorn-
<A NAME="964"></A><BR>They will never allow thee. It is not I that am 
<A NAME="965"></A>niggard.
<A NAME="966"></A><BR>I will give thee to dance in Tegea, with noisy foot-fall,
<A NAME="967"></A><BR>And with the measuring line mete out the glorious champaign. When the 
<A NAME="968"></A>Lacedaemonians received this reply, leaving the rest of Arcadia untouched, 
<A NAME="969"></A>they marched against the Tegeans, carrying with them fetters, so confident 
<A NAME="970"></A>had this oracle (which was, in truth, but of base metal) made them that 
<A NAME="971"></A>they would enslave the Tegeans. The battle, however, went against them, 
<A NAME="972"></A>and many fell into the enemy's hands. Then these persons, wearing the fetters 
<A NAME="973"></A>which they had themselves brought, and fastened together in a string, measured 
<A NAME="974"></A>the Tegean plain as they executed their labours. The fetters in which they 
<A NAME="975"></A>worked were still, in my day, preserved at Tegea where they hung round 
<A NAME="976"></A>the walls of the temple of Minerva Alea.
<A NAME="977"></A><BR><BR>Throughout the whole of this early contest with the Tegeans, the 
<A NAME="978"></A>Lacedaemonians met with nothing but defeats; but in the time of Croesus, 
<A NAME="979"></A>under the kings Anaxandrides and  Aristo, fortune had turned in their favour, 
<A NAME="980"></A>in the manner which I will now relate. Having been worsted in every engagement 
<A NAME="981"></A>by their enemy, they sent to Delphi, and inquired of the oracle what god 
<A NAME="982"></A>they must propitiate to prevail in the war against the Tegeans. The answer 
<A NAME="983"></A>of the Pythoness was that before they could prevail, they must remove to 
<A NAME="984"></A>Sparta the bones of Orestes, the son of Agamemnon. Unable to discover his 
<A NAME="985"></A>burial-place, they sent a second time, and asked the god where the body 
<A NAME="986"></A>of the hero had been laid. The following was the answer they 
<A NAME="987"></A>received:-
<A NAME="988"></A><BR><BR>Level and smooth is the plain where Arcadian Tegea 
<A NAME="989"></A>standeth;
<A NAME="990"></A><BR>There two winds are ever, by strong necessity, blowing,
<A NAME="991"></A><BR>Counter-stroke answers stroke, and evil lies upon 
<A NAME="992"></A>evil.
<A NAME="993"></A><BR>There all-teeming Earth doth harbour the son of 
<A NAME="994"></A>Atrides;
<A NAME="995"></A><BR>Bring thou him to thy city, and then be Tegea's master. After this 
<A NAME="996"></A>reply, the Lacedaemonians were no nearer discovering the burial-place than 
<A NAME="997"></A>before, though they continued to search for it diligently; until at last 
<A NAME="998"></A>a man named Lichas, one of the Spartans called Agathoergi, found it. The 
<A NAME="999"></A>Agathoergi are citizens who have just served their time among the knights. 
<A NAME="1000"></A>The five eldest of the knights go out every year, and are bound during 
<A NAME="1001"></A>the year after their discharge to go wherever the State sends them, and 
<A NAME="1002"></A>actively employ themselves in its service.
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR><BR>Lichas was one of this body when, partly by good luck, partly by 
<A NAME="1004"></A>his own wisdom, he discovered the burial-place. Intercourse between the 
<A NAME="1005"></A>two States existing just at this time, he went to Tegea, and, happening 
<A NAME="1006"></A>to enter into the workshop of a smith, he saw him forging some iron. As 
<A NAME="1007"></A>he stood marvelling at what he beheld, he was observed by the smith who, 
<A NAME="1008"></A>leaving off his work, went up to him and said,
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR><BR>"Certainly, then, you Spartan stranger, you would have been wonderfully 
<A NAME="1010"></A>surprised if you had seen what I have, since you make a marvel even of 
<A NAME="1011"></A>the working in iron. I wanted to make myself a well in this room, and began 
<A NAME="1012"></A>to dig it, when what think you? I came upon a coffin seven cubits long. 
<A NAME="1013"></A>I had never believed that men were taller in the olden times than they 
<A NAME="1014"></A>are now, so I opened the coffin. The body inside was of the same length: 
<A NAME="1015"></A>I measured it, and filled up the hole again."
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR><BR>Such was the man's account of what he had seen. The other, on turning 
<A NAME="1017"></A>the matter over in his mind, conjectured that this was the body of Orestes, 
<A NAME="1018"></A>of which the oracle had spoken. He guessed so, because he observed that 
<A NAME="1019"></A>the smithy had two bellows, which he understood to be the two winds, and 
<A NAME="1020"></A>the hammer and anvil would do for the stroke and the counterstroke, and 
<A NAME="1021"></A>the iron that was being wrought for the evil lying upon evil. This he imagined 
<A NAME="1022"></A>might be so because iron had been discovered to the hurt of man. Full of 
<A NAME="1023"></A>these conjectures, he sped back to Sparta and laid the whole matter before 
<A NAME="1024"></A>his countrymen. Soon after, by a concerted plan, they brought a charge 
<A NAME="1025"></A>against him, and began a prosecution. Lichas betook himself to Tegea, and 
<A NAME="1026"></A>on his arrival acquainted the smith with his misfortune, and proposed to 
<A NAME="1027"></A>rent his room of him. The smith refused for some time; but at last Lichas 
<A NAME="1028"></A>persuaded him, and took up his abode in it. Then he opened the grave, and 
<A NAME="1029"></A>collecting the bones, returned with them to Sparta. From henceforth, whenever 
<A NAME="1030"></A>the Spartans and the Tegeans made trial of each other's skill in arms, 
<A NAME="1031"></A>the Spartans always had greatly the advantage; and by the time to which 
<A NAME="1032"></A>we are now come they were masters of most of the Peloponnese.
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR><BR>Croesus, informed of all these circumstances, sent messengers to 
<A NAME="1034"></A>Sparta, with gifts in their hands, who were to ask the Spartans to enter 
<A NAME="1035"></A>into alliance with him. They received strict injunctions as to what they 
<A NAME="1036"></A>should say, and on their arrival at Sparta spake as 
<A NAME="1037"></A>follows:-
<A NAME="1038"></A><BR><BR>"Croesus, king of the Lydians and of other nations, has sent us 
<A NAME="1039"></A>to speak thus to you: 'Oh Lacedaemonians, the god has bidden me to make 
<A NAME="1040"></A>the Greek my friend; I therefore apply to you, in conformity with the oracle, 
<A NAME="1041"></A>knowing that you hold the first rank in Greece, and desire to become your 
<A NAME="1042"></A>friend and ally in all true faith and honesty.'"
<A NAME="1043"></A><BR><BR>Such was the message which Croesus sent by his heralds. The Lacedaemonians, 
<A NAME="1044"></A>who were aware beforehand of the reply given him by the oracle, were full 
<A NAME="1045"></A>of joy at the coming of the messengers, and at once took the oaths of friendship 
<A NAME="1046"></A>and alliance: this they did the more readily as they had previously contracted 
<A NAME="1047"></A>certain obligations towards him. They had sent to Sardis on one occasion 
<A NAME="1048"></A>to purchase some gold, intending to use it on a statue of Apollo- the statue, 
<A NAME="1049"></A>namely, which remains to this day at Thornax in Laconia, when Croesus, 
<A NAME="1050"></A>hearing of the matter, gave them as a gift the gold which they 
<A NAME="1051"></A>wanted.
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR><BR>This was one reason why the Lacedaemonians were so willing to make 
<A NAME="1053"></A>the alliance: another was, because Croesus had chosen them for his friends 
<A NAME="1054"></A>in preference to all the other Greeks. They therefore held themselves in 
<A NAME="1055"></A>readiness to come at his summons, and not content with so doing, they further 
<A NAME="1056"></A>had a huge vase made in bronze, covered with figures of animals all round 
<A NAME="1057"></A>the outside of the rim, and large enough to contain three hundred amphorae, 
<A NAME="1058"></A>which they sent to Croesus as a return for his presents to them. The vase, 
<A NAME="1059"></A>however, never reached Sardis. Its miscarriage is accounted for in two 
<A NAME="1060"></A>quite different ways. The Lacedaemonian story is that when it reached Samos, 
<A NAME="1061"></A>on its way towards Sardis, the Samians having knowledge of it, put to sea 
<A NAME="1062"></A>in their ships of war and made it their prize. But the Samians declare 
<A NAME="1063"></A>that the Lacedaemonians who had the vase in charge, happening to arrive 
<A NAME="1064"></A>too late, and learning that Sardis had fallen and that Croesus was a prisoner, 
<A NAME="1065"></A>sold it in their island, and the purchasers (who were, they say, private 
<A NAME="1066"></A>persons) made an offering of it at the shrine of Juno: the sellers were 
<A NAME="1067"></A>very likely on their return to Sparta to have said that they had been robbed 
<A NAME="1068"></A>of it by the Samians. Such, then, was the fate of the 
<A NAME="1069"></A>vase.
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile Croesus, taking the oracle in a wrong sense, led his 
<A NAME="1071"></A>forces into Cappadocia, fully expecting to defeat Cyrus and destroy the 
<A NAME="1072"></A>empire of the Persians. While he was still engaged in making preparations 
<A NAME="1073"></A>for his attack, a Lydian named Sandanis, who had always been looked upon 
<A NAME="1074"></A>as a wise man, but who after this obtained a very great name indeed among 
<A NAME="1075"></A>his countrymen, came forward and counselled the king in these 
<A NAME="1076"></A>words:
<A NAME="1077"></A><BR><BR>"Thou art about, oh! king, to make war against men who wear leathern 
<A NAME="1078"></A>trousers, and have all their other garments of leather; who feed not on 
<A NAME="1079"></A>what they like, but on what they can get from a soil that is sterile and 
<A NAME="1080"></A>unkindly; who do not indulge in wine, but drink water; who possess no figs 
<A NAME="1081"></A>nor anything else that is good to eat. If, then, thou conquerest them, 
<A NAME="1082"></A>what canst thou get from them, seeing that they have nothing at all? But 
<A NAME="1083"></A>if they conquer thee, consider how much that is precious thou wilt lose: 
<A NAME="1084"></A>if they once get a taste of our pleasant things, they will keep such hold 
<A NAME="1085"></A>of them that we shall never be able to make them loose their grasp. For 
<A NAME="1086"></A>my part, I am thankful to the gods that they have not put it into the hearts 
<A NAME="1087"></A>of the Persians to invade Lydia."
<A NAME="1088"></A><BR><BR>Croesus was not persuaded by this speech, though it was true enough; 
<A NAME="1089"></A>for before the conquest of Lydia, the Persians possessed none of the luxuries 
<A NAME="1090"></A>or delights of life.
<A NAME="1091"></A><BR><BR>The Cappadocians are known to the Greeks by the name of Syrians. 
<A NAME="1092"></A>Before the rise of the Persian power, they had been subject to the Medes;

<A NAME="1094"></A>between the Median and the Lydian empires was the river Halys. This stream, 
<A NAME="1095"></A>which rises in the mountain country of Armenia, runs first through Cilicia;
