<A NAME="10"></A><B>Thalia</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>The above-mentioned Amasis was the Egyptian king against whom Cambyses, 
<A NAME="12"></A>son of Cyrus, made his expedition; and with him went an army composed of 
<A NAME="13"></A>the many nations under his rule, among them being included both Ionic and 
<A NAME="14"></A>Aeolic Greeks. The reason of the invasion was the following. Cambyses, 
<A NAME="15"></A>by the advice of a certain Egyptian, who was angry with Amasis for having 
<A NAME="16"></A>torn him from his wife and children and given him over to the Persians, 
<A NAME="17"></A>had sent a herald to Amasis to ask his daughter in marriage. His adviser 
<A NAME="18"></A>was a physician, whom Amasis, when Cyrus had requested that he would send 
<A NAME="19"></A>him the most skilful of all the Egyptian eye-doctors, singled out as the 
<A NAME="20"></A>best from the whole number. Therefore the Egyptian bore Amasis a grudge, 
<A NAME="21"></A>and his reason for urging Cambyses to ask the hand of the king's daughter 
<A NAME="22"></A>was, that if he complied, it might cause him annoyance; if he refused, 
<A NAME="23"></A>it might make Cambyses his enemy. When the message came, Amasis, who much 
<A NAME="24"></A>dreaded the power of the Persians, was greatly perplexed whether to give 
<A NAME="25"></A>his daughter or no; for that Cambyses did not intend to make her his wife, 
<A NAME="26"></A>but would only receive her as his concubine, he knew for certain. He therefore 
<A NAME="27"></A>cast the matter in his mind, and finally resolved what he would do. There 
<A NAME="28"></A>was a daughter of the late king Apries, named Nitetis, a tall and beautiful 
<A NAME="29"></A>woman, the last survivor of that royal house. Amasis took this woman, and 
<A NAME="30"></A>decking her out with gold and costly garments, sent her to Persia as if 
<A NAME="31"></A>she had been his own child. Some time afterwards, Cambyses, as he gave 
<A NAME="32"></A>her an embrace, happened to call her by her father's name, whereupon she 
<A NAME="33"></A>said to him, "I see, O king, thou knowest not how thou has been cheated 
<A NAME="34"></A>by Amasis; who took me, and, tricking me out with gauds, sent me to thee 
<A NAME="35"></A>as his own daughter. But I am in truth the child of Apries, who was his 
<A NAME="36"></A>lord and master, until he rebelled against him, together with the rest 
<A NAME="37"></A>of the Egyptians, and put him to death." It was this speech, and the cause 
<A NAME="38"></A>of quarrel it disclosed, which roused the anger of Cambyses, son of Cyrus, 
<A NAME="39"></A>and brought his arms upon Egypt. Such is the Persian 
<A NAME="40"></A>story.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR><BR>The Egyptians, however, claim Cambyses as belonging to them, declaring 
<A NAME="42"></A>that he was the son of this Nitetis. It was Cyrus, they say, and not Cambyses, 
<A NAME="43"></A>who sent to Amasis for his daughter. But here they mis-state the truth. 
<A NAME="44"></A>Acquainted as they are beyond all other men with the laws and customs of 
<A NAME="45"></A>the Persians, they cannot but be well aware, first, that it is not the 
<A NAME="46"></A>Persian wont to allow a bastard to reign when there is a legitimate heir; 
<A NAME="47"></A>and next, that Cambyses was the son of Cassandane, the daughter of Pharnaspes, 
<A NAME="48"></A>an Achaemenian, and not of this Egyptian. But the fact is that they pervert 
<A NAME="49"></A>history in order to claim relationship with the house of Cyrus. Such is 
<A NAME="50"></A>the truth of this matter.
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR>I have also heard another account, which I do not at all believe: 
<A NAME="52"></A>that a Persian lady came to visit the wives of Cyrus, and seeing how tall 
<A NAME="53"></A>and beautiful were the children of Cassandane, then standing by, broke 
<A NAME="54"></A>out into loud praise of them, and admired them exceedingly. But Cassandane, 
<A NAME="55"></A>wife of Cyrus, answered, "Though such the children I have borne him, yet 
<A NAME="56"></A>Cyrus slights me and gives all his regard to the new-comer from Egypt." 
<A NAME="57"></A>Thus did she express her vexation on account of Nitetis: whereupon Cambyses, 
<A NAME="58"></A>the eldest of her boys, exclaimed, "Mother, when I am a man, I will turn 
<A NAME="59"></A>Egypt upside down for you." He was but ten years old, as the tale runs, 
<A NAME="60"></A>when he said this, and astonished all the women, yet he never forgot it 
<A NAME="61"></A>afterwards; and on this account, they say, when he came to be a man, and 
<A NAME="62"></A>mounted the throne, he made his expedition against Egypt.
<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR>There was another matter, quite distinct, which helped to bring 
<A NAME="64"></A>about the expedition. One of the mercenaries of Amasis, a Halicarnassian, 
<A NAME="65"></A>Phanes by name, a man of good judgment, and a brave warrior, dissatisfied 
<A NAME="66"></A>for some reason or other with his master, deserted the service, and taking 
<A NAME="67"></A>ship, fled to Cambyses, wishing to get speech with him. As he was a person 
<A NAME="68"></A>of no small account among the mercenaries, and one who could give very 
<A NAME="69"></A>exact intelligence about Egypt, Amasis, anxious to recover him, ordered 
<A NAME="70"></A>that he should be pursued. He gave the matter in charge to one of the most 
<A NAME="71"></A>trusty of the eunuchs, who went in quest of the Halicarnassian in a vessel 
<A NAME="72"></A>of war. The eunuch caught him in Lycia, but did not contrive to bring him 
<A NAME="73"></A>back to Egypt, for Phanes outwitted him by making his guards drunk, and 
<A NAME="74"></A>then escaping into Persia. Now it happened that Cambyses was meditating 
<A NAME="75"></A>his attack on Egypt, and doubting how he might best pass the desert, when 
<A NAME="76"></A>Phanes arrived, and not only told him all the secrets of Amasis, but advised 
<A NAME="77"></A>him also how the desert might be crossed. He counselled him to send an 
<A NAME="78"></A>ambassador to the king of the Arabs, and ask him for safe-conduct through 
<A NAME="79"></A>the region.
<A NAME="80"></A><BR><BR>Now the only entrance into Egypt is by this desert: the country 
<A NAME="81"></A>from Phoenicia to the borders of the city Cadytis belongs to the people 
<A NAME="82"></A>called the Palaestine Syrians; from Cadytis, which it appears to me is 
<A NAME="83"></A>a city almost as large as Sardis, the marts upon the coast till you reach 
<A NAME="84"></A>Jenysus are the Arabian king's; after Jenysus the Syrians again come in, 
<A NAME="85"></A>and extend to Lake Serbonis, near the place where Mount Casius juts out 
<A NAME="86"></A>into the sea. At Lake Serbonis, where the tale goes that Typhon hid himself, 
<A NAME="87"></A>Egypt begins. Now the whole tract between Jenysus on the one side, and 
<A NAME="88"></A>Lake Serbonis and Mount Casius on the other, and this is no small space, 
<A NAME="89"></A>being as much as three days' journey, is a dry desert without a drop of 
<A NAME="90"></A>water.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR>I shall now mention a thing of which few of those who sail to Egypt 
<A NAME="92"></A>are aware. Twice a year wine is brought into Egypt from every part of Greece, 
<A NAME="93"></A>as well as from Phoenicia, in earthen jars; and yet in the whole country 
<A NAME="94"></A>you will nowhere see, as I may say, a single jar. What then, every one 
<A NAME="95"></A>will ask, becomes of the jars? This, too, I will clear up. The burgomaster 
<A NAME="96"></A>of each town has to collect the wine-jars within his district, and to carry 
<A NAME="97"></A>them to Memphis, where they are all filled with water by the Memphians, 
<A NAME="98"></A>who then convey them to this desert tract of Syria. And so it comes to 
<A NAME="99"></A>pass that all the jars which enter Egypt year by year, and are there put 
<A NAME="100"></A>up to sale, find their way into Syria, whither all the old jars have gone 
<A NAME="101"></A>before them.
<A NAME="102"></A><BR><BR>This way of keeping the passage into Egypt fit for use by storing 
<A NAME="103"></A>water there, was begun by the Persians so soon as they became masters of 
<A NAME="104"></A>that country. As, however, at the time of which we speak the tract had 
<A NAME="105"></A>not yet been so supplied, Cambyses took the advice of his Halicarnassian 
<A NAME="106"></A>guest, and sent messengers to the Arabian to beg a safe-conduct through 
<A NAME="107"></A>the region. The Arabian granted his prayer, and each pledged faith to the 
<A NAME="108"></A>other.
<A NAME="109"></A><BR><BR>The Arabs keep such pledges more religiously than almost any other 
<A NAME="110"></A>people. They plight faith with the forms following. When two men would 
<A NAME="111"></A>swear a friendship, they stand on each side of a third: he with a sharp 
<A NAME="112"></A>stone makes a cut on the inside of the hand of each near the middle finger, 
<A NAME="113"></A>and, taking a piece from their dress, dips it in the blood of each, and 
<A NAME="114"></A>moistens therewith seven stones lying in the midst, calling the while on 
<A NAME="115"></A>Bacchus and Urania. After this, the man who makes the pledge commends the 
<A NAME="116"></A>stranger (or the citizen, if citizen he be) to all his friends, and they 
<A NAME="117"></A>deem themselves bound to stand to the engagement. They have but these two 
<A NAME="118"></A>gods, to wit, Bacchus and Urania; and they say that in their mode of cutting 
<A NAME="119"></A>the hair, they follow Bacchus. Now their practice is to cut it in a ring, 
<A NAME="120"></A>away from the temples. Bacchus they call in their language Orotal, and 
<A NAME="121"></A>Urania, Alilat.
<A NAME="122"></A><BR><BR>When therefore the Arabian had pledged his faith to the messengers 
<A NAME="123"></A>of Cambyses, he straightway contrived as follows:- he filled a number of 
<A NAME="124"></A>camels' skins with water, and loading therewith all the live camels that 
<A NAME="125"></A>he possessed, drove them into the desert, and awaited the coming of the 
<A NAME="126"></A>army. This is the more likely of the two tales that are told. The other 
<A NAME="127"></A>is an improbable story, but, as it is related, I think that I ought not 
<A NAME="128"></A>to pass it by. There is a great river in Arabia, called the Corys, which 
<A NAME="129"></A>empties itself into the Erythraean sea. The Arabian king, they say, made 
<A NAME="130"></A>a pipe of the skins of oxen and other beasts, reaching from this river 
<A NAME="131"></A>all the way to the desert, and so brought the water to certain cisterns 
<A NAME="132"></A>which he had dug in the desert to receive it. It is a twelve days' journey 
<A NAME="133"></A>from the river to this desert tract. And the water, they say, was brought 
<A NAME="134"></A>through three different pipes to three separate places.
<A NAME="135"></A><BR><BR>Psammenitus, son of Amasis, lay encamped at the mouth of the. Nile, 
<A NAME="136"></A>called the Pelusiac, awaiting Cambyses. For Cambyses, when he went up against 
<A NAME="137"></A>Egypt, found Amasis no longer in life: he had died after ruling Egypt forty 
<A NAME="138"></A>and four years, during all which time no great misfortune had befallen 
<A NAME="139"></A>him. When he died, his body was embalmed, and buried in the tomb which 
<A NAME="140"></A>he had himself caused to be made in the temple. After his son Psammenitus 
<A NAME="141"></A>had mounted the throne, a strange prodigy occurred in Egypt- rain fell 
<A NAME="142"></A>at Egyptian Thebes, a thing which never happened before, and which, to 
<A NAME="143"></A>the present time, has never happened again, as the Thebans themselves testify. 
<A NAME="144"></A>In Upper Egypt it does not usually rain at all; but on this occasion, rain 
<A NAME="145"></A>fell at Thebes in small drops.
<A NAME="146"></A><BR><BR>The Persians crossed the desert, and, pitching their camp close 
<A NAME="147"></A>to the Egyptians, made ready for battle. Hereupon the mercenaries in the 
<A NAME="148"></A>pay of Psammenitus, who were Greeks and Carians, full of anger against 
<A NAME="149"></A>Phanes for having brought a foreign army upon Egypt, bethought themselves 
<A NAME="150"></A>of a mode whereby they might be revenged on him. Phanes had left sons in 
<A NAME="151"></A>Egypt. The mercenaries took these, and leading them to the camp, displayed 
<A NAME="152"></A>them before the eyes of their father; after which they brought out a bowl, 
<A NAME="153"></A>and, placing it in the space between the two hosts, they led the sons of 
<A NAME="154"></A>Phanes, one by one, to the vessel, and slew them over it. When the last 
<A NAME="155"></A>was dead, water and wine were poured into the bowl, and all the soldiers 
<A NAME="156"></A>tasted of the blood, and so they went to the battle. Stubborn was the fight 
<A NAME="157"></A>which followed, and it was not till vast numbers had been slain upon both 
<A NAME="158"></A>sides, that the Egyptians turned and fled.
<A NAME="159"></A><BR><BR>On the field where this battle was fought I saw a very wonderful 
<A NAME="160"></A>thing which the natives pointed out to me. The bones of the slain lie scattered 
<A NAME="161"></A>upon the field in two lots, those of the Persians in one place by themselves, 
<A NAME="162"></A>as the bodies lay at the first- those of the Egyptians in another place 
<A NAME="163"></A>apart from them. If, then, you strike the Persian skulls, even with a pebble, 
<A NAME="164"></A>they are so weak, that you break a hole in them; but the Egyptian skulls 
<A NAME="165"></A>are so strong, that you may smite them with a stone and you will scarcely 
<A NAME="166"></A>break them in. They gave me the following reason for this difference, which 
<A NAME="167"></A>seemed to me likely enough:- The Egyptians (they said) from early childhood 
<A NAME="168"></A>have the head shaved, and so by the action of the sun the skull becomes 
<A NAME="169"></A>thick and hard. The same cause prevents baldness in Egypt, where you see 
<A NAME="170"></A>fewer bald men than in any other land. Such, then, is the reason why the 
<A NAME="171"></A>skulls of the Egyptians are so strong. The Persians, on the other hand, 
<A NAME="172"></A>have feeble skulls, because they keep themselves shaded from the first, 
<A NAME="173"></A>wearing turbans upon their heads. What I have here mentioned I saw with 
<A NAME="174"></A>my own eyes, and I observed also the like at Papremis, in the case of the 
<A NAME="175"></A>Persians who were killed with Achaeamenes, the son of Darius, by Inarus 
<A NAME="176"></A>the Libyan.
<A NAME="177"></A><BR><BR>The Egyptians who fought in the battle, no sooner turned their 
<A NAME="178"></A>backs upon the enemy, than they fled away in complete disorder to Memphis, 
<A NAME="179"></A>where they shut themselves up within the walls. Hereupon Cambyses sent 
<A NAME="180"></A>a Mytilenaean vessel, with a Persian herald on board, who was to sail up 
<A NAME="181"></A>the Nile to Memphis, and invite the Egyptians to a surrender. They, however, 
<A NAME="182"></A>when they saw the vessel entering the town, poured forth in crowds from 
<A NAME="183"></A>the castle, destroyed the ship, and, tearing the crew limb from limb, so 
<A NAME="184"></A>bore them into the fortress. After this Memphis was besieged, and in due 
<A NAME="185"></A>time surrendered. Hereon the Libyans who bordered upon Egypt, fearing the 
<A NAME="186"></A>fate of that country, gave themselves up to Cambyses without a battle, 
<A NAME="187"></A>made an agreement to pay tribute to him, and forthwith sent him gifts. 
<A NAME="188"></A>The Cyrenaeans too, and the Barcaeans, having the same fear as the Libyans, 
<A NAME="189"></A>immediately did the like. Cambyses received the Libyan presents very graciously, 
<A NAME="190"></A>but not so the gifts of the Cyrenaeans. They had sent no more than five 
<A NAME="191"></A>hundred minx of silver, which Cambyses, I imagine, thought too little. 
<A NAME="192"></A>He therefore snatched the money from them, and with his own hands scattered 
<A NAME="193"></A>it among his soldiers.
<A NAME="194"></A><BR><BR>Ten days after the fort had fallen, Cambyses resolved to try the 
<A NAME="195"></A>spirit of Psammenitus, the Egyptian king, whose whole reign had been but 
<A NAME="196"></A>six months. He therefore had him set in one of the suburbs, and many other 
<A NAME="197"></A>Egyptians with him, and there subjected him to insult. First of all he 
<A NAME="198"></A>sent his daughter out from the city, clothed in the garb of a slave, with 
<A NAME="199"></A>a pitcher to draw water. Many virgins, the daughters of the chief nobles, 
<A NAME="200"></A>accompanied her, wearing the same dress. When the damsels came opposite 
<A NAME="201"></A>the place where their fathers sate, shedding tears and uttering cries of 
<A NAME="202"></A>woe, the fathers, all but Psammenitus, wept and wailed in return, grieving 
<A NAME="203"></A>to see their children in so sad a plight; but he, when he had looked and 
<A NAME="204"></A>seen, bent his head towards the ground. In this way passed by the water-carriers. 
<A NAME="205"></A>Next to them came Psammenitus' son, and two thousand Egyptians of the same 
<A NAME="206"></A>age with him- all of them having ropes round their necks and bridles in 
<A NAME="207"></A>their mouths- and they too passed by on their way to suffer death for the 
<A NAME="208"></A>murder of the Mytilenaeans who were destroyed, with their vessel, in Memphis. 
<A NAME="209"></A>For so had the royal judges given their sentence for each Mytilenaean ten 
<A NAME="210"></A>of the noblest Egyptians must forfeit life." King Psammenitus saw the train 
<A NAME="211"></A>pass on, and knew his son was being led to death, but while the other Egyptians 
<A NAME="212"></A>who sate around him wept and were sorely troubled, he showed no further 
<A NAME="213"></A>sign than when he saw his daughter. And now, when they too were gone, it 
<A NAME="214"></A>chanced that one of his former boon-companions, a man advanced in years, 
<A NAME="215"></A>who had been stripped of all that he had and was a beggar, came where Psammenitus, 
<A NAME="216"></A>son of Amasis, and the rest of the Egyptians were, asking alms from the 
<A NAME="217"></A>soldiers. At this sight the king burst into tears, and weeping out aloud, 
<A NAME="218"></A>called his friend by his name, and smote himself on the head. Now there 
<A NAME="219"></A>were some who had been set to watch Psammenitus and see what he would do 
<A NAME="220"></A>as each train went by; so these persons went and told Cambyses of his behaviour. 
<A NAME="221"></A>Then he, astonished at what was done, sent a messenger to Psammenitus, 
<A NAME="222"></A>and questioned him, saying, "Psammenitus, thy lord Cambyses asketh thee 
<A NAME="223"></A>why, when thou sawest thy daughter brought to shame, and thy son on his 
<A NAME="224"></A>way to death, thou didst neither utter cry nor shed tear, while to a beggar, 
<A NAME="225"></A>who is, he hears, a stranger to thy race, thou gavest those marks of honour." 
<A NAME="226"></A>To this question Psammenitus made answer, "O son of Cyrus, my own misfortunes 
<A NAME="227"></A>were too great for tears; but the woe of my friend deserved them. When 
<A NAME="228"></A>a man falls from splendour and plenty into beggary at the threshold of 
<A NAME="229"></A>old age, one may well weep for him." When the messenger brought back this 
<A NAME="230"></A>answer, Cambyses owned it was just; Croesus, likewise, the Egyptians say, 
<A NAME="231"></A>burst into tears- for he too had come into Egypt with Cambyses- and the 
<A NAME="232"></A>Persians who were present wept. Even Cambyses himself was touched with 
<A NAME="233"></A>pity, and he forthwith gave an order that the son of Psammenitus should 
<A NAME="234"></A>be spared from the number of those appointed to die, and Psammenitus himself 
<A NAME="235"></A>brought from the suburb into his presence.
<A NAME="236"></A><BR><BR>The messengers were too late to save the life of Psammenitus' son, 
<A NAME="237"></A>who had been cut in pieces the first of all; but they took Psammenitus 
<A NAME="238"></A>himself and brought him before the king. Cambyses allowed him to live with 
<A NAME="239"></A>him, and gave him no more harsh treatment; nay, could he have kept from 
<A NAME="240"></A>intermeddling with affairs, he might have recovered Egypt, and ruled it 
<A NAME="241"></A>as governor. For the Persian wont is to treat the sons of kings with honour, 
<A NAME="242"></A>and even to give their fathers' kingdoms to the children of such as revolt 
<A NAME="243"></A>from them. There are many cases from which one may collect that this is 
<A NAME="244"></A>the Persian rule, and especially those of Pausiris and Thannyras. Thannyras 
<A NAME="245"></A>was son of Inarus the Libyan, and was allowed to succeed his father, as 
<A NAME="246"></A>was also Pausiris, son of Amyrtaeus; yet certainly no two persons ever 
<A NAME="247"></A>did the Persians more damage than Amyrtaeus and Inarus. In this case Psammenitus 
<A NAME="248"></A>plotted evil, and received his reward accordingly. He was discovered to 
<A NAME="249"></A>be stirring up revolt in Egypt, wherefore Cambyses, when his guilt clearly 
<A NAME="250"></A>appeared, compelled him to drink bull's blood, which presently caused his 
<A NAME="251"></A>death. Such was the end of Psammenitus.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR>After this Cambyses left Memphis, and went to Sais, wishing to 
<A NAME="253"></A>do that which he actually did on his arrival there. He entered the palace 
<A NAME="254"></A>of Amasis, and straightway commanded that the body of the king should be 
<A NAME="255"></A>brought forth from the sepulchre. When the attendants did according to 
<A NAME="256"></A>his commandment, he further bade them scourge the body, and prick it with 
<A NAME="257"></A>goads, and pluck the hair from it, and heap upon it all manner of insults. 
<A NAME="258"></A>The body, however, having been embalmed, resisted, and refused to come 
<A NAME="259"></A>apart, do what they would to it; so the attendants grew weary of their 
<A NAME="260"></A>work; whereupon Cambyses bade them take the corpse and burn it. This was 
<A NAME="261"></A>truly an impious command to give, for the Persians hold fire to be a god, 
<A NAME="262"></A>and never by any chance burn their dead. Indeed this practice is unlawful, 
<A NAME="263"></A>both with them and with the Egyptians- with them for the reason above mentioned, 
<A NAME="264"></A>since they deem it wrong to give the corpse of a man to a god; and with 
<A NAME="265"></A>the Egyptians, because they believe fire to be a live animal, which eats 
<A NAME="266"></A>whatever it can seize, and then, glutted with the food, dies with the matter 
<A NAME="267"></A>which it feeds upon. Now to give a man's body to be devoured by beasts 
<A NAME="268"></A>is in no wise agreeable to their customs, and indeed this is the very reason 
<A NAME="269"></A>why they embalm their dead; namely, to prevent them from being eaten in 
<A NAME="270"></A>the grave by worms. Thus Cambyses commanded what both nations accounted 
<A NAME="271"></A>unlawful. According to the Egyptians, it was not Amasis who was thus treated, 
<A NAME="272"></A>but another of their nation who was of about the same height. The Persians, 
<A NAME="273"></A>believing this man's body to be the king's, abused it in the fashion described 
<A NAME="274"></A>above. Amasis, they say, was warned by an oracle of what would happen to 
<A NAME="275"></A>him after his death: in order, therefore, to prevent the impending fate, 
<A NAME="276"></A>he buried the body, which afterwards received the blows, inside his own 
<A NAME="277"></A>tomb near the entrance, commanding his son to bury him, when he died, in 
<A NAME="278"></A>the furthest recess of the same sepulchre. For my own part I do not believe 
<A NAME="279"></A>that these orders were ever given by Amasis; the Egyptians, as it seems 
<A NAME="280"></A>to me, falsely assert it, to save their own dignity.
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR>After this Cambyses took counsel with himself, and planned three 
<A NAME="282"></A>expeditions. One was against the Carthaginians, another against the Ammonians, 
<A NAME="283"></A>and a third against the long-lived Ethiopians, who dwelt in that part of 
<A NAME="284"></A>Libya which borders upon the southern sea. He judged it best to despatch 
<A NAME="285"></A>his fleet against Carthage and to send some portion of his land army to 
<A NAME="286"></A>act against the Ammonians, while his spies went into Ethiopia, under the 
<A NAME="287"></A>pretence of carrying presents to the king, but in reality to take note 
<A NAME="288"></A>of all they saw, and especially to observe whether there was really what 
<A NAME="289"></A>is called "the table of the Sun" in Ethiopia.
<A NAME="290"></A><BR><BR>Now the table of the Sun according to the accounts given of it 
<A NAME="291"></A>may be thus described:- It is a meadow in the skirts of their city full 
<A NAME="292"></A>of the boiled flesh of all manner of beasts, which the magistrates are 
<A NAME="293"></A>careful to store with meat every night, and where whoever likes may come 
<A NAME="294"></A>and eat during the day. The people of the land say that the earth itself 
<A NAME="295"></A>brings forth the food. Such is the description which is given of this 
<A NAME="296"></A>table.
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR>When Cambyses had made up his mind that the spies should go, he 
<A NAME="298"></A>forthwith sent to Elephantine for certain of the Icthyophagi who were acquainted 
<A NAME="299"></A>with the Ethiopian tongue; and, while they were being fetched, issued orders 
<A NAME="300"></A>to his fleet to sail against Carthage. But the Phoenicians said they would 
<A NAME="301"></A>not go, since they were bound to the Carthaginians by solemn oaths, and 
<A NAME="302"></A>since besides it would be wicked in them to make war on their own children. 
<A NAME="303"></A>Now when the Phoenicians refused, the rest of the fleet was unequal to 
<A NAME="304"></A>the undertaking; and so it was that the Carthaginians escaped, and were 
<A NAME="305"></A>not enslaved by the Persians. Cambyses thought it not right to force the 
<A NAME="306"></A>war upon the Phoenicians, because they had yielded themselves to the Persians, 
<A NAME="307"></A>and because upon the Phoenicians all his sea-service depended. The Cyprians 
<A NAME="308"></A>had also joined the Persians of their own accord, and took part with them 
<A NAME="309"></A>in the expedition against Egypt.
<A NAME="310"></A><BR><BR>As soon as the Icthyophagi arrived from Elephantine, Cambyses, 
<A NAME="311"></A>having told them what they were to say, forthwith despatched them into 
<A NAME="312"></A>Ethiopia with these following gifts: to wit, a purple robe, a gold chain 
<A NAME="313"></A>for the neck, armlets, an alabaster box of myrrh, and a cask of palm wine. 
<A NAME="314"></A>The Ethiopians to whom this embassy was sent are said to be the tallest 
<A NAME="315"></A>and handsomest men in the whole world. In their customs they differ greatly 
<A NAME="316"></A>from the rest of mankind, and particularly in the way they choose their 
<A NAME="317"></A>kings; for they find out the man who is the tallest of all the citizens, 
<A NAME="318"></A>and of strength equal to his height, and appoint him to rule over 
<A NAME="319"></A>them.
<A NAME="320"></A><BR><BR>The Icthyophagi on reaching this people, delivered the gifts to 
<A NAME="321"></A>the king of the country, and spoke as follows:- "Cambyses, king of the 
<A NAME="322"></A>Persians, anxious to become thy ally and sworn friend, has sent us to hold 
<A NAME="323"></A>converse with thee, and to bear thee the gifts thou seest, which are the 
<A NAME="324"></A>things wherein he himself delights the most." Hereon the Ethiopian, who 
<A NAME="325"></A>knew they came as spies, made answer:- "The king of the Persians sent you 
<A NAME="326"></A>not with these gifts because he much desired to become my sworn friend- 
<A NAME="327"></A>nor is the account which ye give of yourselves true, for ye are come to 
<A NAME="328"></A>search out my kingdom. Also your king is not a just man- for were he so, 
<A NAME="329"></A>he had not coveted a land which is not his own, nor brought slavery on 
<A NAME="330"></A>a people who never did him any wrong. Bear him this bow, and say- 'The 
<A NAME="331"></A>king of the Ethiops thus advises the king of the Persians when the Persians 
<A NAME="332"></A>can pull a bow of this strength thus easily, then let him come with an 
<A NAME="333"></A>army of superior strength against the long-lived Ethiopians- till then, 
<A NAME="334"></A>let him thank the gods that they have not put it into the heart of the 
<A NAME="335"></A>sons of the Ethiops to covet countries which do not belong to 
<A NAME="336"></A>them.'
<A NAME="337"></A><BR><BR>So speaking, he unstrung the bow, and gave it into the hands of 
<A NAME="338"></A>the messengers. Then, taking the purple robe, he asked them what it was, 
<A NAME="339"></A>and how it had been made. They answered truly, telling him concerning the 
<A NAME="340"></A>purple, and the art of the dyer- whereat he observed "that the men were 
<A NAME="341"></A>deceitful, and their garments also." Next he took the neck-chain and the 
<A NAME="342"></A>armlets, and asked about them. So the Icthyophagi explained their use as 
<A NAME="343"></A>ornaments. Then the king laughed, and fancying they were fetters, said, 
<A NAME="344"></A>"the Ethiopians had much stronger ones." Thirdly, he inquired about the 
<A NAME="345"></A>myrrh, and when they told him how it was made and rubbed upon the limbs, 
<A NAME="346"></A>he said the same as he had said about the robe. Last of all he came to 
<A NAME="347"></A>the wine, and having learnt their way of making it, he drank a draught, 
<A NAME="348"></A>which greatly delighted him; whereupon he asked what the Persian king was 
<A NAME="349"></A>wont to eat, and to what age the longest-lived of the Persians had been 
<A NAME="350"></A>known to attain. They told him that the king ate bread, and described the 
<A NAME="351"></A>nature of wheat- adding that eighty years was the longest term of man's 
<A NAME="352"></A>life among the Persians. Hereat he remarked, "It did not surprise him, 
<A NAME="353"></A>if they fed on dirt, that they died so soon; indeed he was sure they never 
<A NAME="354"></A>would have lived so long as eighty years, except for the refreshment they 
<A NAME="355"></A>got from that drink (meaning the wine), wherein he confessed the Persians 
<A NAME="356"></A>surpassed the Ethiopians."
<A NAME="357"></A><BR><BR>The Icthyophagi then in their turn questioned the king concerning 
<A NAME="358"></A>the term of life, and diet of his people, and were told that most of them 
<A NAME="359"></A>lived to be a hundred and twenty years old, while some even went beyond 
<A NAME="360"></A>that age- they ate boiled flesh, and had for their drink nothing but milk. 
<A NAME="361"></A>When the Icthyophagi showed wonder at the number of the years, he led them 
<A NAME="362"></A>to a fountain, wherein when they had washed, they found their flesh all 
<A NAME="363"></A>glossy and sleek, as if they had bathed in oil- and a scent came from the 
<A NAME="364"></A>spring like that of violets. The water was so weak, they said, that nothing 
<A NAME="365"></A>would float in it, neither wood, nor any lighter substance, but all went 
<A NAME="366"></A>to the bottom. If the account of this fountain be true, it would be their 
<A NAME="367"></A>constant use of the water from it which makes them so long-lived. When 
<A NAME="368"></A>they quitted the fountain the king led them to a prison, where the prisoners 
<A NAME="369"></A>were all of them bound with fetters of gold. Among these Ethiopians copper 
<A NAME="370"></A>is of all metals the most scarce and valuable. After they had seen the 
<A NAME="371"></A>prison, they were likewise shown what is called "the table of the 
<A NAME="372"></A>Sun."
<A NAME="373"></A><BR><BR>Also, last of all, they were allowed to behold the coffins of the 
<A NAME="374"></A>Ethiopians, which are made (according to report) of crystal, after the 
<A NAME="375"></A>following fashion:- When the dead body has been dried, either in the Egyptian, 
<A NAME="376"></A>or in some other manner, they cover the whole with gypsum, and adorn it 
<A NAME="377"></A>with painting until it is as like the living man as possible. Then they 
<A NAME="378"></A>place the body in a crystal pillar which has been hollowed out to receive 
<A NAME="379"></A>it, crystal being dug up in great abundance in their country, and of a 
<A NAME="380"></A>kind very easy to work. You may see the corpse through the pillar within 
<A NAME="381"></A>which it lies; and it neither gives out any unpleasant odour, nor is it 
<A NAME="382"></A>in any respect unseemly; yet there is no part that is not as plainly visible 
<A NAME="383"></A>as if the body were bare. The next of kin keep the crystal pillar in their 
<A NAME="384"></A>houses for a full year from the time of the death, and give it the first 
<A NAME="385"></A>fruits continually, and honour it with sacrifice. After the year is out 
<A NAME="386"></A>they bear the pillar forth, and set it up near the town.
<A NAME="387"></A><BR><BR>When the spies had now seen everything, they returned back to Egypt, 
<A NAME="388"></A>and made report to Cambyses, who was stirred to anger by their words. Forthwith 
<A NAME="389"></A>he set out on his march against the Ethiopians without having made any 
<A NAME="390"></A>provision for the sustenance of his army, or reflected that he was about 
<A NAME="391"></A>to wage war in the uttermost parts of the earth. Like a senseless madman 
<A NAME="392"></A>as he was, no sooner did he receive the report of the Icthyophagi than 
<A NAME="393"></A>he began his march, bidding the Greeks who were with his army remain where 
<A NAME="394"></A>they were, and taking only his land force with him. At Thebes, which he 
<A NAME="395"></A>passed through on his way, he detached from his main body some fifty thousand 
<A NAME="396"></A>men, and sent them against the Ammonians with orders to carry the people 
<A NAME="397"></A>into captivity, and burn the oracle of Jupiter. Meanwhile he himself went 
<A NAME="398"></A>on with the rest of his forces against the Ethiopians. Before, however, 
<A NAME="399"></A>he had accomplished one-fifth part of the distance, all that the army had 
<A NAME="400"></A>in the way of provisions failed; whereupon the men began to eat the sumpter 
<A NAME="401"></A>beasts, which shortly failed also. If then, at this time, Cambyses, seeing 
<A NAME="402"></A>what was happening, had confessed himself in the wrong, and led his army 
<A NAME="403"></A>back, he would have done the wisest thing that he could after the mistake 
<A NAME="404"></A>made at the outset; but as it was, he took no manner of heed, but continued 
<A NAME="405"></A>to march forwards. So long as the earth gave them anything, the soldiers 
<A NAME="406"></A>sustained life by eating the grass and herbs; but when they came to the 
<A NAME="407"></A>bare sand, a portion of them were guilty of a horrid deed: by tens they 
<A NAME="408"></A>cast lots for a man, who was slain to be the food of the others. When Cambyses 
<A NAME="409"></A>heard of these doings, alarmed at such cannibalism, he gave up his attack 
<A NAME="410"></A>on Ethiopia, and retreating by the way he had come, reached Thebes, after 
<A NAME="411"></A>he had lost vast numbers of his soldiers. From Thebes he marched down to 
<A NAME="412"></A>Memphis, where he dismissed the Greeks, allowing them to sail home. And 
<A NAME="413"></A>so ended the expedition against Ethiopia.
<A NAME="414"></A><BR><BR>The men sent to attack the Ammonians, started from Thebes, having 
<A NAME="415"></A>guides with them, and may be clearly traced as far as the city Oasis, which 
<A NAME="416"></A>is inhabited by Samians, said to be of the tribe Aeschrionia. The place 
<A NAME="417"></A>is distant from Thebes seven days' journey across the sand, and is called 
<A NAME="418"></A>in our tongue "the Island of the Blessed." Thus far the army is known to 
<A NAME="419"></A>have made its way; but thenceforth nothing is to be heard of them, except 
<A NAME="420"></A>what the Ammonians, and those who get their knowledge from them, report. 
<A NAME="421"></A>It is certain they neither reached the Ammonians, nor even came back to 
<A NAME="422"></A>Egypt. Further than this, the Ammonians relate as follows:- That the Persians 
<A NAME="423"></A>set forth from Oasis across the sand, and had reached about half way between 
<A NAME="424"></A>that place and themselves when, as they were at their midday meal, a wind 
<A NAME="425"></A>arose from the south, strong and deadly, bringing with it vast columns 
<A NAME="426"></A>of whirling sand, which entirely covered up the troops and caused them 
<A NAME="427"></A>wholly to disappear. Thus, according to the Ammonians, did it fare with 
<A NAME="428"></A>this army.
<A NAME="429"></A><BR><BR>About the time when Cambyses arrived at Memphis, Apis appeared 
<A NAME="430"></A>to the Egyptians. Now Apis is the god whom the Greeks call Epaphus. As 
<A NAME="431"></A>soon as he appeared, straightway all the Egyptians arrayed themselves in 
<A NAME="432"></A>their gayest garments, and fell to feasting and jollity: which when Cambyses 
<A NAME="433"></A>saw, making sure that these rejoicings were on account of his own ill success, 
<A NAME="434"></A>he called before him the officers who had charge of Memphis, and demanded 
<A NAME="435"></A>of them- "Why, when he was in Memphis before, the Egyptians had done nothing 
<A NAME="436"></A>of this kind, but waited until now, when he had returned with the loss 
<A NAME="437"></A>of so many of his troops?" The officers made answer, "That one of their 
<A NAME="438"></A>gods had appeared to them, a god who at long intervals of time had been 
<A NAME="439"></A>accustomed to show himself in Egypt- and that always on his appearance 
<A NAME="440"></A>the whole of Egypt feasted and kept jubilee." When Cambyses heard this, 
<A NAME="441"></A>he told them that they lied, and as liars he condemned them all to suffer 
<A NAME="442"></A>death.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR><BR>When they were dead, he called the priests to his presence, and 
<A NAME="444"></A>questioning them received the same answer; whereupon he observed, "That 
<A NAME="445"></A>he would soon know whether a tame god had really come to dwell in Egypt"- 
<A NAME="446"></A>and straightway, without another word, he bade them bring Apis to him. 
<A NAME="447"></A>So they went out from his presence to fetch the god. Now this Apis, or 
<A NAME="448"></A>Epaphus, is the calf of a cow which is never afterwards able to bear young. 
<A NAME="449"></A>The Egyptians say that fire comes down from heaven upon the cow, which 
<A NAME="450"></A>thereupon conceives Apis. The calf which is so called has the following 
<A NAME="451"></A>marks:- He is black, with a square spot of white upon his forehead, and 
<A NAME="452"></A>on his back the figure of an eagle; the hairs in his tail are double, and 
<A NAME="453"></A>there is a beetle upon his tongue.
<A NAME="454"></A><BR><BR>When the priests returned bringing Apis with them, Cambyses, like 
<A NAME="455"></A>the harebrained person that he was, drew his dagger, and aimed at the belly 
<A NAME="456"></A>of the animal, but missed his mark, and stabbed him in the thigh. Then 
<A NAME="457"></A>he laughed, and said thus to the priests:- "Oh! blockheads, and think ye 
<A NAME="458"></A>that gods become like this, of flesh and blood, and sensible to steel? 
<A NAME="459"></A>A fit god indeed for Egyptians, such an one! But it shall cost you dear 
<A NAME="460"></A>that you have made me your laughing-stock." When he had so spoken, he ordered 
<A NAME="461"></A>those whose business it was to scourge the priests, and if they found any 
<A NAME="462"></A>of the Egyptians keeping festival to put them to death. Thus was the feast 
<A NAME="463"></A>stopped throughout the land of Egypt, and the priests suffered punishment. 
<A NAME="464"></A>Apis, wounded in the thigh, lay some time pining in the temple; at last 
<A NAME="465"></A>he died of his wound, and the priests buried him secretly without the knowledge 
<A NAME="466"></A>of Cambyses.
<A NAME="467"></A><BR><BR>And now Cambyses, who even before had not been quite in his right 
<A NAME="468"></A>mind, was forthwith, as the Egyptians say, smitten with madness for this 
<A NAME="469"></A>crime. The first of his outrages was the slaying of Smerdis, his full brother, 
<A NAME="470"></A>whom he had sent back to Persia from Egypt out of envy, because he drew 
<A NAME="471"></A>the bow brought from the Ethiopians by the Icthyophagi (which none of the 
<A NAME="472"></A>other Persians were able to bend) the distance of two fingers' breadth. 
<A NAME="473"></A>When Smerdis was departed into Persia, Cambyses had a vision in his sleep- 
<A NAME="474"></A>he thought a messenger from Persia came to him with tidings that Smerdis 
<A NAME="475"></A>sat upon the royal throne and with his head touched the heavens. Fearing 
<A NAME="476"></A>therefore for himself, and thinking it likely that his brother would kill 
<A NAME="477"></A>him and rule in his stead, Cambyses sent into Persia Prexaspes, whom he 
<A NAME="478"></A>trusted beyond all the other Persians, bidding him put Smerdis to death. 
<A NAME="479"></A>So this Prexaspes went up to Susa and slew Smerdis. Some say he killed 
<A NAME="480"></A>him as they hunted together, others, that he took him down to the Erythraean 
<A NAME="481"></A>Sea, and there drowned him.
<A NAME="482"></A><BR><BR>This, it is said, was the first outrage which Cambyses committed. 
<A NAME="483"></A>The second was the slaying of his sister, who had accompanied him into 
<A NAME="484"></A>Egypt, and lived with him as his wife, though she was his full sister, 
<A NAME="485"></A>the daughter both of his father and his mother. The way wherein he had 
<A NAME="486"></A>made her his wife was the following:-It was not the custom of the Persians, 
<A NAME="487"></A>before his time, to marry their sisters, but Cambyses, happening to fall 
<A NAME="488"></A>in love with one of his and wishing to take her to wife, as he knew that 
<A NAME="489"></A>it was an uncommon thing, called together the royal judges, and put it 
<A NAME="490"></A>to them, "whether there was any law which allowed a brother, if he wished, 
<A NAME="491"></A>to marry his sister?" Now the royal judges are certain picked men among 
<A NAME="492"></A>the Persians, who hold their office for life, or until they are found guilty 
<A NAME="493"></A>of some misconduct. By them justice is administered in Persia, and they 
<A NAME="494"></A>are the interpreters of the old laws, all disputes being referred to their 
<A NAME="495"></A>decision. When Cambyses, therefore, put his question to these judges, they 
<A NAME="496"></A>gave him an answer which was at once true and safe- "they did not find 
<A NAME="497"></A>any law," they said, "allowing a brother to take his sister to wife, but 
<A NAME="498"></A>they found a law, that the king of the Persians might do whatever he pleased." 
<A NAME="499"></A>And so they neither warped the law through fear of Cambyses, nor ruined 
<A NAME="500"></A>themselves by over stiffly maintaining the law; but they brought another 
<A NAME="501"></A>quite distinct law to the king's help, which allowed him to have his wish. 
<A NAME="502"></A>Cambyses, therefore, married the object of his love, and no long time afterwards 
<A NAME="503"></A>he took to wife another sister. It was the younger of these who went with 
<A NAME="504"></A>him into Egypt, and there suffered death at his hands.
<A NAME="505"></A><BR><BR>Concerning the manner of her death, as concerning that of Smerdis, 
<A NAME="506"></A>two different accounts are given. The story which the Greeks tell is that 
<A NAME="507"></A>Cambyses had set a young dog to fight the cub of a lioness- his wife looking 
<A NAME="508"></A>on at the time. Now the dog was getting the worse, when a pup of the same 
<A NAME="509"></A>litter broke his chain, and came to his brother's aid- then the two dogs 
<A NAME="510"></A>together fought the lion, and conquered him. The thing greatly pleased 
<A NAME="511"></A>Cambyses, but his sister who was sitting by shed tears. When Cambyses saw 
<A NAME="512"></A>this, he asked her why she wept: whereon she told him, that seeing the 
<A NAME="513"></A>young dog come to his brother's aid made her think of Smerdis, whom there 
<A NAME="514"></A>was none to help. For this speech, the Greeks say, Cambyses put her to 
<A NAME="515"></A>death. But the Egyptians tell the story thus:- The two were sitting at 
<A NAME="516"></A>table, when the sister took a lettuce, and stripping the leaves off, asked 
<A NAME="517"></A>her brother "when he thought the lettuce looked the prettiest- when it 
<A NAME="518"></A>had all its leaves on, or now that it was stripped?" He answered, "When 
<A NAME="519"></A>the leaves were on." "But thou," she rejoined, "hast done as I did to the 
<A NAME="520"></A>lettuce, and made bare the house of Cyrus." Then Cambyses was wroth, and 
<A NAME="521"></A>sprang fiercely upon her, though she was with child at the time. And so 
<A NAME="522"></A>it came to pass that she miscarried and died.
<A NAME="523"></A><BR><BR>Thus mad was Cambyses upon his own kindred, and this either from 
<A NAME="524"></A>his usage of Apis, or from some other among the many causes from which 
<A NAME="525"></A>calamities are wont to arise. They say that from his birth he was afflicted 
<A NAME="526"></A>with a dreadful disease, the disorder which some call "the sacred sickness." 
<A NAME="527"></A>It would be by no means strange, therefore, if his mind were affected in 
<A NAME="528"></A>some degree, seeing that his body laboured under so sore a 
<A NAME="529"></A>malady.
<A NAME="530"></A><BR><BR>He was mad also upon others besides his kindred; among the rest, 
<A NAME="531"></A>upon Prexaspes, the man whom he esteemed beyond all the rest of the Persians, 
<A NAME="532"></A>who carried his messages, and whose son held the office- an honour of no 
<A NAME="533"></A>small account in Persia- of his cupbearer. Him Cambyses is said to have 
<A NAME="534"></A>once addressed as follows:- "What sort of man, Prexaspes, do the Persians 
<A NAME="535"></A>think me? What do they say of me?" Prexaspes answered, "Oh! sire, they 
<A NAME="536"></A>praise thee greatly in all things but one- they say thou art too much given 
<A NAME="537"></A>to love of wine." Such Prexaspes told him was the judgment of the Persians; 
<A NAME="538"></A>whereupon Cambyses, full of rage, made answer, "What? they say now that 
<A NAME="539"></A>I drink too much wine, and so have lost my senses, and am gone out of my 
<A NAME="540"></A>mind! Then their former speeches about me were untrue." For once, when 
<A NAME="541"></A>the Persians were sitting with him, and Croesus was by, he had asked them, 
<A NAME="542"></A>"What sort of man they thought him compared to his father Cyrus?" Hereon 
<A NAME="543"></A>they had answered, "That he surpassed his father, for he was lord of all 
<A NAME="544"></A>that his father ever ruled, and further had made himself master of Egypt, 
<A NAME="545"></A>and the sea." Then Croesus, who was standing near, and misliked the comparison, 
<A NAME="546"></A>spoke thus to Cambyses: "In my judgment, O son of Cyrus, thou art not equal 
<A NAME="547"></A>to thy father, for thou hast not yet left behind thee such a son as he." 
<A NAME="548"></A>Cambyses was delighted when he heard this reply, and praised the judgment 
<A NAME="549"></A>of Croesus.
<A NAME="550"></A><BR><BR>Recollecting these answers, Cambyses spoke fiercely to Prexaspes, 
<A NAME="551"></A>saying, "Judge now thyself, Prexaspes, whether the Persians tell the truth, 
<A NAME="552"></A>or whether it is not they who are mad for speaking as they do. Look there 
<A NAME="553"></A>now at thy son standing in the vestibule- if I shoot and hit him right 
<A NAME="554"></A>in the middle of the heart, it will be plain the Persians have no grounds 
<A NAME="555"></A>for what they say: if I miss him, then I allow that the Persians are right, 
<A NAME="556"></A>and that I am out of my mind." So speaking he drew his bow to the full, 
<A NAME="557"></A>and struck the boy, who straightway fell down dead. Then Cambyses ordered 
<A NAME="558"></A>the body to be opened, and the wound examined; and when the arrow was found 
<A NAME="559"></A>to have entered the heart, the king was quite overjoyed, and said to the 
<A NAME="560"></A>father with a laugh, "Now thou seest plainly, Prexaspes, that it is not 
<A NAME="561"></A>I who am mad, but the Persians who have lost their senses. I pray thee 
<A NAME="562"></A>tell me, sawest thou ever mortal man send an arrow with a better aim?" 
<A NAME="563"></A>Prexaspes, seeing that the king was not in his right mind, and fearing 
<A NAME="564"></A>for himself, replied, "Oh! my lord, I do not think that God himself could 
<A NAME="565"></A>shoot so dexterously." Such was the outrage which Cambyses committed at 
<A NAME="566"></A>this time: at another, he took twelve of the noblest Persians, and, without 
<A NAME="567"></A>bringing any charge worthy of death against them, buried them all up to 
<A NAME="568"></A>the neck.
<A NAME="569"></A><BR><BR>Hereupon Croesus the Lydian thought it right to admonish Cambyses, 
<A NAME="570"></A>which he did in these words following:- "Oh! king, allow not thyself to 
<A NAME="571"></A>give way entirely to thy youth, and the heat of thy temper, but check and 
<A NAME="572"></A>control thyself. It is well to look to consequences, and in forethought 
<A NAME="573"></A>is true wisdom. Thou layest hold of men, who are thy fellow-citizens, and, 
<A NAME="574"></A>without cause of complaint, slayest them- thou even puttest children to 
<A NAME="575"></A>death- bethink thee now, if thou shalt often do things like these, will 
<A NAME="576"></A>not the Persians rise in revolt against thee? It is by thy father's wish 
<A NAME="577"></A>that I offer thee advice; he charged me strictly to give thee such counsel 
<A NAME="578"></A>as I might see to be most for thy good." In thus advising Cambyses, Croesus 
<A NAME="579"></A>meant nothing but what was friendly. But Cambyses answered him, "Dost thou 
<A NAME="580"></A>presume to offer me advice? Right well thou ruledst thy own country when 
<A NAME="581"></A>thou wert a king, and right sage advice thou gavest my father Cyrus, bidding 
<A NAME="582"></A>him cross the Araxes and fight the Massagetae in their own land, when they 
<A NAME="583"></A>were willing to have passed over into ours. By thy misdirection of thine 
<A NAME="584"></A>own affairs thou broughtest ruin upon thyself, and by thy bad counsel, 
<A NAME="585"></A>which he followed, thou broughtest ruin upon Cyrus, my father. But thou 
<A NAME="586"></A>shalt not escape punishment now, for I have long been seeking to find some 
<A NAME="587"></A>occasion against thee." As he thus spoke, Cambyses took up his bow to shoot 
<A NAME="588"></A>at Croesus; but Croesus ran hastily out, and escaped. So when Cambyses 
<A NAME="589"></A>found that he could not kill him with his bow, he bade his servants seize 
<A NAME="590"></A>him, and put him to death. The servants, however, who knew their master's 
<A NAME="591"></A>humour, thought it best to hide Croesus; that so, if Cambyses relented, 
<A NAME="592"></A>and asked for him, they might bring him out, and get a reward for having 
<A NAME="593"></A>saved his life- if, on the other hand, he did not relent, or regret the 
<A NAME="594"></A>loss, they might then despatch him. Not long afterwards, Cambyses did in 
<A NAME="595"></A>fact regret the loss of Croesus, and the servants, perceiving it, let him 
<A NAME="596"></A>know that he was still alive. "I am glad," said he, "that Croesus lives, 
<A NAME="597"></A>but as for you who saved him, ye shall not escape my vengeance, but shall 
<A NAME="598"></A>all of you be put to death." And he did even as he had 
<A NAME="599"></A>said.
<A NAME="600"></A><BR><BR>Many other wild outrages of this sort did Cambyses commit, both 
<A NAME="601"></A>upon the Persians and the allies, while he still stayed at Memphis; among 
<A NAME="602"></A>the rest he opened the ancient sepulchres, and examined the bodies that 
<A NAME="603"></A>were buried in them. He likewise went into the temple of Vulcan, and made 
<A NAME="604"></A>great sport of the image. For the image of Vulcan is very like the Pataeci 
<A NAME="605"></A>of the Phoenicians, wherewith they ornament the prows of their ships of 
<A NAME="606"></A>war. If persons have not seen these, I will explain in a different way- 
<A NAME="607"></A>it is a figure resembling that of a pigmy. He went also into the temple 
<A NAME="608"></A>of the Cabiri, which it is unlawful for any one to enter except the priests, 
<A NAME="609"></A>and not only made sport of the images, but even burnt them. They are made 
<A NAME="610"></A>like the statue of Vulcan, who is said to have been their 
<A NAME="611"></A>father.
<A NAME="612"></A><BR><BR>Thus it appears certain to me, by a great variety of proofs, that 
<A NAME="613"></A>Cambyses was raving mad; he would not else have set himself to make a mock 
<A NAME="614"></A>of holy rites and long-established usages. For if one were to offer men 
<A NAME="615"></A>to choose out of all the customs in the world such as seemed to them the 
<A NAME="616"></A>best, they would examine the whole number, and end by preferring their 
<A NAME="617"></A>own; so convinced are they that their own usages far surpass those of all 
<A NAME="618"></A>others. Unless, therefore, a man was mad, it is not likely that he would 
<A NAME="619"></A>make sport of such matters. That people have this feeling about their laws 
<A NAME="620"></A>may be seen by very many proofs: among others, by the following. Darius, 
<A NAME="621"></A>after he had got the kingdom, called into his presence certain Greeks who 
<A NAME="622"></A>were at hand, and asked- "What he should pay them to eat the bodies of 
<A NAME="623"></A>their fathers when they died?" To which they answered, that there was no 
<A NAME="624"></A>sum that would tempt them to do such a thing. He then sent for certain 
<A NAME="625"></A>Indians, of the race called Callatians, men who eat their fathers, and 
<A NAME="626"></A>asked them, while the Greeks stood by, and knew by the help of an interpreter 
<A NAME="627"></A>all that was said - "What he should give them to burn the bodies of their 
<A NAME="628"></A>fathers at their decease?" The Indians exclaimed aloud, and bade him forbear 
<A NAME="629"></A>such language. Such is men's wont herein; and Pindar was right, in my judgment, 
<A NAME="630"></A>when he said, "Law is the king o'er all."
<A NAME="631"></A><BR><BR>While Cambyses was carrying on this war in Egypt, the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="632"></A>likewise sent a force to Samos against Polycrates, the son of Aeaces, who 
<A NAME="633"></A>had by insurrection made himself master of that island. At the outset he 
<A NAME="634"></A>divided the state into three parts, and shared the kingdom with his brothers, 
<A NAME="635"></A>Pantagnotus and Syloson; but later, having killed the former and banished 
<A NAME="636"></A>the latter, who was the younger of the two, he held the whole island. Hereupon 
<A NAME="637"></A>he made a contract of friendship with Amasis the Egyptian king, sending 
<A NAME="638"></A>him gifts, and receiving from him others in return. In a little while his 
<A NAME="639"></A>power so greatly increased, that the fame of it went abroad throughout 
<A NAME="640"></A>Ionia and the rest of Greece. Wherever he turned his arms, success waited 
<A NAME="641"></A>on him. He had a fleet of a hundred penteconters, and bowmen to the number 
<A NAME="642"></A>of a thousand. Herewith he plundered all, without distinction of friend 
<A NAME="643"></A>or foe; for he argued that a friend was better pleased if you gave him 
<A NAME="644"></A>back what you had taken from him, than if you spared him at the first. 
<A NAME="645"></A>He captured many of the islands, and several towns upon the mainland. Among 
<A NAME="646"></A>his other doings he overcame the Lesbians in a sea-fight, when they came 
<A NAME="647"></A>with all their forces to the help of Miletus, and made a number of them 
<A NAME="648"></A>prisoners. These persons, laden with fetters, dug the moat which surrounds 
<A NAME="649"></A>the castle at Samos.
<A NAME="650"></A><BR><BR>The exceeding good fortune of Polycrates did not escape the notice 
<A NAME="651"></A>of Amasis, who was much disturbed thereat. When therefore his successes 
<A NAME="652"></A>continued increasing, Amasis wrote him the following letter, and sent it 
<A NAME="653"></A>to Samos. "Amasis to Polycrates thus sayeth: It is a pleasure to hear of 
<A NAME="654"></A>a friend and ally prospering, but thy exceeding prosperity does not cause 
<A NAME="655"></A>me joy, forasmuch as I know that the gods are envious. My wish for myself 
<A NAME="656"></A>and for those whom I love is to be now successful, and now to meet with 
<A NAME="657"></A>a check; thus passing through life amid alternate good and ill, rather 
<A NAME="658"></A>than with perpetual good fortune. For never yet did I hear tell of any 
<A NAME="659"></A>one succeeding in all his undertakings, who did not meet with calamity 
<A NAME="660"></A>at last, and come to utter ruin. Now, therefore, give ear to my words, 
<A NAME="661"></A>and meet thy good luck in this way: bethink thee which of all thy treasures 
<A NAME="662"></A>thou valuest most and canst least bear to part with; take it, whatsoever 
<A NAME="663"></A>it be, and throw it away, so that it may be sure never to come any more 
<A NAME="664"></A>into the sight of man. Then, if thy good fortune be not thenceforth chequered 
<A NAME="665"></A>with ill, save thyself from harm by again doing as I have 
<A NAME="666"></A>counselled."
<A NAME="667"></A><BR><BR>When Polycrates read this letter, and perceived that the advice 
<A NAME="668"></A>of Amasis was good, he considered carefully with himself which of the treasures 
<A NAME="669"></A>that he had in store it would grieve him most to lose. After much thought 
<A NAME="670"></A>he made up his mind that it was a signet-ring which he was wont to wear, 
<A NAME="671"></A>an emerald set in gold, the workmanship of Theodore, son of Telecles, a 
<A NAME="672"></A>Samian. So he determined to throw this away; and, manning a penteconter, 
<A NAME="673"></A>he went on board, and bade the sailors put out into the open sea. When 
<A NAME="674"></A>he was now a long way from the island, he took the ring from his finger, 
<A NAME="675"></A>and, in the sight of all those who were on board, flung it into the deep. 
<A NAME="676"></A>This done, he returned home, and gave vent to his sorrow.
<A NAME="677"></A><BR><BR>Now it happened five or six days afterwards that a fisherman caught 
<A NAME="678"></A>a fish so large and beautiful that he thought it well deserved to be made 
<A NAME="679"></A>a present of to the king. So he took it with him to the gate of the palace, 
<A NAME="680"></A>and said that he wanted to see Polycrates. Then Polycrates allowed him 
<A NAME="681"></A>to come in, and the fisherman gave him the fish with these words following- 
<A NAME="682"></A>"Sir king, when I took this prize, I thought I would not carry it to market, 
<A NAME="683"></A>though I am a poor man who live by my trade. I said to myself, it is worthy 
<A NAME="684"></A>of Polycrates and his greatness; and so I brought it here to give it to 
<A NAME="685"></A>you." The speech pleased the king, who thus spoke in reply:- "Thou didst 
<A NAME="686"></A>right well, friend, and I am doubly indebted, both for the gift, and for 
<A NAME="687"></A>the speech. Come now, and sup with me." So the fisherman went home, esteeming 
<A NAME="688"></A>it a high honour that he had been asked to sup with the king. Meanwhile 
<A NAME="689"></A>the servants, on cutting open the fish, found the signet of their master 
<A NAME="690"></A>in its belly. No sooner did they see it than they seized upon it, and hastening 
<A NAME="691"></A>to Polycrates with great joy, restored it to him, and told him in what 
<A NAME="692"></A>way it had been found. The king, who saw something providential in the 
<A NAME="693"></A>matter, forthwith wrote a letter to Amasis, telling him all that had happened, 
<A NAME="694"></A>what he had himself done, and what had been the upshot- and despatched 
<A NAME="695"></A>the letter to Egypt.
<A NAME="696"></A><BR><BR>When Amasis had read the letter of Polycrates, he perceived that 
<A NAME="697"></A>it does not belong to man to save his fellow-man from the fate which is 
<A NAME="698"></A>in store for him; likewise he felt certain that Polycrates would end ill, 
<A NAME="699"></A>as he prospered in everything, even finding what he had thrown away. So 
<A NAME="700"></A>he sent a herald to Samos, and dissolved the contract of friendship. This 
<A NAME="701"></A>he did, that when the great and heavy misfortune came, he might escape 
<A NAME="702"></A>the grief which he would have felt if the sufferer had been his 
<A NAME="703"></A>bond-friend.
<A NAME="704"></A><BR><BR>It was with this Polycrates, so fortunate in every undertaking, 
<A NAME="705"></A>that the Lacedaemonians now went to war. Certain Samians, the same who 
<A NAME="706"></A>afterwards founded the city of Cydonia in Crete, had earnestly intreated 
<A NAME="707"></A>their help. For Polycrates, at the time when Cambyses, son of Cyrus, was 
<A NAME="708"></A>gathering together an armament against Egypt, had sent to beg him not to 
<A NAME="709"></A>omit to ask aid from Samos; whereupon Cambyses with much readiness despatched 
<A NAME="710"></A>a messenger to the island, and made request that Polycrates would give 
<A NAME="711"></A>some ships to the naval force which he was collecting against Egypt. Polycrates 
<A NAME="712"></A>straightway picked out from among the citizens such as he thought most 
<A NAME="713"></A>likely to stir revolt against him, and manned with them forty triremes, 
<A NAME="714"></A>which he sent to Cambyses, bidding him keep the men safe, and never allow 
<A NAME="715"></A>them to return home.
<A NAME="716"></A><BR><BR>Now some accounts say that these Samians did not reach Egypt; for 
<A NAME="717"></A>that when they were off Carpathus, they took counsel together and resolved 
<A NAME="718"></A>to sail no further. But others maintain that they did go to Egypt, and, 
<A NAME="719"></A>finding themselves watched, deserted, and sailed back to Samos. There Polycrates 
<A NAME="720"></A>went out against them with his fleet, and a battle was fought and gained 
<A NAME="721"></A>by the exiles; after which they disembarked upon the island and engaged 
<A NAME="722"></A>the land forces of Polycrates, but were defeated, and so sailed off to 
<A NAME="723"></A>Lacedaemon. Some relate that the Samians from Egypt overcame Polycrates, 
<A NAME="724"></A>but it seems to me untruly; for had the Samians been strong enough to conquer 
<A NAME="725"></A>Polycrates by themselves, they would not have needed to call in the aid 
<A NAME="726"></A>of the Lacedaemonians. And moreover, it is not likely that a king who had 
<A NAME="727"></A>in his pay so large a body of foreign mercenaries, and maintained likewise 
<A NAME="728"></A>such a force of native bowmen, would have been worsted by an army so small 
<A NAME="729"></A>as that of the returned Samians. As for his own subjects, to hinder them 
<A NAME="730"></A>from betraying him and joining the exiles, Polycrates shut up their wives 
<A NAME="731"></A>and children in the sheds built to shelter his ships, and was ready to 
<A NAME="732"></A>burn sheds and all in case of need.
<A NAME="733"></A><BR><BR>When the banished Samians reached Sparta, they had audience of 
<A NAME="734"></A>the magistrates, before whom they made a long speech, as was natural with 
<A NAME="735"></A>persons greatly in want of aid. Accordingly at this first sitting the Spartans 
<A NAME="736"></A>answered them that they had forgotten the first half of their speech, and 
<A NAME="737"></A>could make nothing of the remainder. Afterwards the Samians had another 
<A NAME="738"></A>audience, whereat they simply said, showing a bag which they had brought 
<A NAME="739"></A>with them, "The bag wants flour." The Spartans answered that they did not 
<A NAME="740"></A>need to have said "the bag"; however, they resolved to give them 
<A NAME="741"></A>aid.
<A NAME="742"></A><BR><BR>Then the Lacedaemonians made ready and set forth to the attack 
<A NAME="743"></A>of Samos, from a motive of gratitude, if we may believe the Samians, because 
<A NAME="744"></A>the Samians had once sent ships to their aid against the Messenians; but 
<A NAME="745"></A>as the Spartans themselves say, not so much from any wish to assist the 
<A NAME="746"></A>Samians who begged their help, as from a desire to punish the people who 
<A NAME="747"></A>had seized the bowl which they sent to Croesus, and the corselet which 
<A NAME="748"></A>Amasis, king of Egypt, sent as a present to them. The Samians made prize 
<A NAME="749"></A>of this corselet the year before they took the bowl- it was of linen, and 
<A NAME="750"></A>had a vast number of figures of animals inwoven into its fabric, and was 
<A NAME="751"></A>likewise embroidered with gold and tree-wool. What is most worthy of admiration 
<A NAME="752"></A>in it is that each of the twists, although of fine texture, contains within 
<A NAME="753"></A>it three hundred and sixty threads, all of them clearly visible. The corselet 
<A NAME="754"></A>which Amasis gave to the temple of Minerva in Lindus is just such 
<A NAME="755"></A>another.
<A NAME="756"></A><BR><BR>The Corinthians likewise right willingly lent a helping hand towards 
<A NAME="757"></A>the expedition against Samos; for a generation earlier, about the time 
<A NAME="758"></A>of the seizure of the wine-bowl, they too had suffered insult at the hands 
<A NAME="759"></A>of the Samians. It happened that Periander, son of Cypselus, had taken 
<A NAME="760"></A>three hundred boys, children of the chief nobles among the Corcyraeans, 
<A NAME="761"></A>and sent them to Alyattes for eunuchs; the men who had them in charge touched 
<A NAME="762"></A>at Samos on their way to Sardis; whereupon the Samians, having found out 
<A NAME="763"></A>what was to become of the boys when they reached that city, first prompted 
<A NAME="764"></A>them to take sanctuary at the temple of Diana; and after this, when the 
<A NAME="765"></A>Corinthians, as they were forbidden to tear the suppliants from the holy 
<A NAME="766"></A>place, sought to cut off from them all supplies of food, invented a festival 
<A NAME="767"></A>in their behalf, which they celebrate to this day with the selfsame rites. 
<A NAME="768"></A>Each evening, as night closed in, during the whole time that the boys continued 
<A NAME="769"></A>there, choirs of youths and virgins were placed about the temple, carrying 
<A NAME="770"></A>in their hands cakes made of sesame and honey, in order that the Corcyraean 
<A NAME="771"></A>boys might snatch the cakes, and so get enough to live 
<A NAME="772"></A>upon.
<A NAME="773"></A><BR><BR>And this went on for so long, that at last the Corinthians who 
<A NAME="774"></A>had charge of the boys gave them up, and took their departure, upon which 
<A NAME="775"></A>the Samians conveyed them back to Corcyra. If now, after the death of Periander, 
<A NAME="776"></A>the Corinthians and Corcyraeans had been good friends, it is not to be 
<A NAME="777"></A>imagined that the former would ever have taken part in the expedition against 
<A NAME="778"></A>Samos for such a reason as this; but as, in fact, the two people have always, 
<A NAME="779"></A>ever since the first settlement of the island, been enemies to one another, 
<A NAME="780"></A>this outrage was remembered, and the Corinthians bore the Samians a grudge 
<A NAME="781"></A>for it. Periander had chosen the youths from among the first families in 
<A NAME="782"></A>Corcyra, and sent them a present to Alyattes, to avenge a wrong which he 
<A NAME="783"></A>had received. For it was the Corcyraeans who began the quarrel and injured 
<A NAME="784"></A>Periander by an outrage of a horrid nature.
<A NAME="785"></A><BR><BR>After Periander had put to death his wife Melissa, it chanced that 
<A NAME="786"></A>on this first affliction a second followed of a different kind. His wife 
<A NAME="787"></A>had borne him two sons, and one of them had now reached the age of seventeen, 
<A NAME="788"></A>the other of eighteen years, when their mother's father, Procles, tyrant 
<A NAME="789"></A>of Epidaurus, asked them to his court. They went, and Procles treated them 
<A NAME="790"></A>with much kindness, as was natural, considering they were his own daughter's 
<A NAME="791"></A>children. At length, when the time for parting came, Procles, as he was 
<A NAME="792"></A>sending them on their way, said, "Know you now, my children, who it was 
<A NAME="793"></A>that caused your mother's death?" The elder son took no account of this 
<A NAME="794"></A>speech, but the younger, whose name was Lycophron, was sorely troubled 
<A NAME="795"></A>at it- so much so, that when he got back to Corinth, looking upon his father 
<A NAME="796"></A>as his mother's murderer, he would neither speak to him, nor answer when 
<A NAME="797"></A>spoken to, nor utter a word in reply to all his questionings. So Periander 
<A NAME="798"></A>at last, growing furious at such behaviour, banished him from his 
<A NAME="799"></A>house.
<A NAME="800"></A><BR><BR>The younger son gone, he turned to the elder and asked him, "what 
<A NAME="801"></A>it was that their grandfather had said to them?" Then he related in how 
<A NAME="802"></A>kind and friendly a fashion he had received them; but, not having taken 
<A NAME="803"></A>any notice of the speech which Procles had uttered at parting, he quite 
<A NAME="804"></A>forgot to mention it. Periander insisted that it was not possible this 
<A NAME="805"></A>should be all- their grandfather must have given them some hint or other- 
<A NAME="806"></A>and he went on pressing him, till at last the lad remembered the parting 
<A NAME="807"></A>speech and told it. Periander, after he had turned the whole matter over 
<A NAME="808"></A>in his thoughts, and felt unwilling to give way at all, sent a messenger 
<A NAME="809"></A>to the persons who had opened their houses to his outcast son, and forbade 
<A NAME="810"></A>them to harbour him. Then the boy, when he was chased from one friend, 
<A NAME="811"></A>sought refuge with another, but was driven from shelter to shelter by the 
<A NAME="812"></A>threats of his father, who menaced all those that took him in, and commanded 
<A NAME="813"></A>them to shut their doors against him. Still, as fast as he was forced to 
<A NAME="814"></A>leave one house he went to another, and was received by the inmates; for 
<A NAME="815"></A>his acquaintance, although in no small alarm, yet gave him shelter, as 
<A NAME="816"></A>he was Periander's son.
<A NAME="817"></A><BR><BR>At last Periander made proclamation that whoever harboured his 
<A NAME="818"></A>son or even spoke to him, should forfeit a certain sum of money to Apollo. 
<A NAME="819"></A>On hearing this no one any longer liked to take him in, or even to hold 
<A NAME="820"></A>converse with him, and he himself did not think it right to seek to do 
<A NAME="821"></A>what was forbidden; so, abiding by his resolve, he made his lodging in 
<A NAME="822"></A>the public porticos. When four days had passed in this way, Periander, 
<A NAME="823"></A>secing how wretched his son was, that he neither washed nor took any food, 
<A NAME="824"></A>felt moved with compassion towards him; wherefore, foregoing his anger, 
<A NAME="825"></A>he approached him, and said, "Which is better, oh! my son, to fare as now 
<A NAME="826"></A>thou farest, or to receive my crown and all the good things that I possess, 
<A NAME="827"></A>on the one condition of submitting thyself to thy father? See, now, though 
<A NAME="828"></A>my own child, and lord of this wealthy Corinth, thou hast brought thyself 
<A NAME="829"></A>to a beggar's life, because thou must resist and treat with anger him whom 
<A NAME="830"></A>it least behoves thee to oppose. If there has been a calamity, and thou 
<A NAME="831"></A>bearest me ill will on that account, bethink thee that I too feel it, and 
<A NAME="832"></A>am the greatest sufferer, in as much as it was by me that the deed was 
<A NAME="833"></A>done. For thyself, now that thou knowest how much better a thing it is 
<A NAME="834"></A>to be envied than pitied, and how dangerous it is to indulge anger against 
<A NAME="835"></A>parents and superiors, come back with me to thy home." With such words 
<A NAME="836"></A>as these did Periander chide his son; but the son made no reply, except 
<A NAME="837"></A>to remind his father that he was indebted to the god in the penalty for 
<A NAME="838"></A>coming and holding converse with him. Then Periander knew that there was 
<A NAME="839"></A>no cure for the youth's malady, nor means of overcoming it; so he prepared 
<A NAME="840"></A>a ship and sent him away out of his sight to Corcyra, which island at that 
<A NAME="841"></A>time belonged to him. As for Procles, Periander, regarding him as the true 
<A NAME="842"></A>author of all his present troubles, went to war with him as soon as his 
<A NAME="843"></A>son was gone, and not only made himself master of his kingdom Epidaurus, 
<A NAME="844"></A>but also took Procles himself, and carried him into 
<A NAME="845"></A>captivity.
<A NAME="846"></A><BR><BR>As time went on, and Periander came to be old, he found himself 
<A NAME="847"></A>no longer equal to the oversight and management of affairs. Seeing, therefore, 
<A NAME="848"></A>in his eldest son no manner of ability, but knowing him to be dull and 
<A NAME="849"></A>blockish, he sent to Corcyra and recalled Lycophron to take the kingdom. 
<A NAME="850"></A>Lycophron, however, did not even deign to ask the bearer of this message 
<A NAME="851"></A>a question. But Periander's heart was set upon the youth, so he sent again 
<A NAME="852"></A>to him, this time by his own daughter, the sister of Lycophron, who would, 
<A NAME="853"></A>he thought, have more power to persuade him than any other person. Then 
<A NAME="854"></A>she, when she reached Corcyra, spoke thus with her brother:- "Dost thou 
<A NAME="855"></A>wish the kingdom, brother, to pass into strange hands, and our father's 
<A NAME="856"></A>wealth to be made a prey, rather than thyself return to enjoy it? Come 
<A NAME="857"></A>back home with me, and cease to punish thyself. It is scant gain, this 
<A NAME="858"></A>obstinacy. Why seek to cure evil by evil? Mercy, remember, is by many set 
<A NAME="859"></A>above justice. Many, also, while pushing their mother's claims have forfeited 
<A NAME="860"></A>their father's fortune. Power is a slippery thing- it has many suitors; 
<A NAME="861"></A>and he is old and stricken in years- let not thy own inheritance go to 
<A NAME="862"></A>another." Thus did the sister, who had been tutored by Periander what to 
<A NAME="863"></A>say, urge all the arguments most likely to have weight with her brother. 
<A NAME="864"></A>He however made answer, "That so long as he knew his father to be still 
<A NAME="865"></A>alive, he would never go back to Corinth." When the sister brought Periander 
<A NAME="866"></A>this reply, he sent his son a third time by a herald, and said he would 
<A NAME="867"></A>come himself to Corcyra, and let his son take his place at Corinth as heir 
<A NAME="868"></A>to his kingdom. To these terms Lycophron agreed; and Periander was making 
<A NAME="869"></A>ready to pass into Corcyra and his son to return to Corinth, when the Corcyraeans, 
<A NAME="870"></A>being informed of what was taking place, to keep Periander away, put the 
<A NAME="871"></A>young man to death. For this reason it was that Periander took vengeance 
<A NAME="872"></A>on the Corcyraeans.
<A NAME="873"></A><BR><BR>The Lacedaemonians arrived before Samos with a mighty armament, 
<A NAME="874"></A>and forthwith laid siege to the place. In one of the assaults upon the 
<A NAME="875"></A>walls, they forced their way to the top of the tower which stands by the 
<A NAME="876"></A>sea on the side where the suburb is, but Polycrates came in person to the 
<A NAME="877"></A>rescue with a strong force, and beat them back. Meanwhile at the upper 
<A NAME="878"></A>tower, which stood on the ridge of the hill, the besieged, both mercenaries 
<A NAME="879"></A>and Samians, made a sally; but after they had withstood the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="880"></A>a short time, they fled backwards, and the Lacedaemonians, pressing upon 
<A NAME="881"></A>them, slew numbers.
<A NAME="882"></A><BR><BR>If now all who were present had behaved that day like Archias and 
<A NAME="883"></A>Lycopas, two of the Lacedaemonians, Samos might have been taken. For these 
<A NAME="884"></A>two heroes, following hard upon the flying Samians, entered the city along 
<A NAME="885"></A>with them, and, being all alone, and their retreat cut off, were slain 
<A NAME="886"></A>within the walls of the place. I myself once fell in with the grandson 
<A NAME="887"></A>of this Archias, a man named Archias like his grandsire, and the son of 
<A NAME="888"></A>Samius, whom I met at Pitana, to which canton he belonged. He respected 
<A NAME="889"></A>the Samians beyond all other foreigners, and he told me that his father 
<A NAME="890"></A>was called Samius, because his grandfather Archias died in Samos so gloriously, 
<A NAME="891"></A>and that the reason why he respected the Samians so greatly was that his 
<A NAME="892"></A>grandsire was buried with public honours by the Samian 
<A NAME="893"></A>people.
<A NAME="894"></A><BR><BR>The Lacedaemonians besieged Samos during forty days, but not making 
<A NAME="895"></A>any progress before the place, they raised the siege at the end of that 
<A NAME="896"></A>time, and returned home to the Peloponnese. There is a silly tale told 
<A NAME="897"></A>that Polycrates struck a quantity of the coin of his country in lead, and, 
<A NAME="898"></A>coating it with gold, gave it to the Lacedaemonians, who on receiving it 
<A NAME="899"></A>took their departure.
<A NAME="900"></A><BR><BR>This was the first expedition into Asia of the Lacedaemonian 
<A NAME="901"></A>Dorians.
<A NAME="902"></A><BR><BR>The Samians who had fought against Polycrates, when they knew that 
<A NAME="903"></A>the Lacedaemonians were about to forsake them, left Samos themselves, and 
<A NAME="904"></A>sailed to Siphnos. They happened to be in want of money; and the Siphnians 
<A NAME="905"></A>at that time were at the height of their greatness, no islanders having 
<A NAME="906"></A>so much wealth as they. There were mines of gold and silver in their country, 
<A NAME="907"></A>and of so rich a yield, that from a tithe of the ores the Siphnians furnished 
<A NAME="908"></A>out a treasury at Delphi which was on a par with the grandest there. What 
<A NAME="909"></A>the mines yielded was divided year by year among the citizens. At the time 
<A NAME="910"></A>when they formed the treasury, the Siphnians consulted the oracle, and 
<A NAME="911"></A>asked whether their good things would remain to them many years. The Pythoness 
<A NAME="912"></A>made answer as follows:-
<A NAME="913"></A><BR><BR>When the Prytanies'seat shines white in the island of 
<A NAME="914"></A>Siphnos,
<A NAME="915"></A><BR>White-browed all the forum-need then of a true seer's 
<A NAME="916"></A>wisdom-
<A NAME="917"></A><BR>Danger will threat from a wooden host, and a herald in scarlet. Now 
<A NAME="918"></A>about this time the forum of the Siphnians and their townhall or prytaneum 
<A NAME="919"></A>had been adorned with Parian marble.
<A NAME="920"></A><BR><BR>The Siphnians, however, were unable to understand the oracle, either 
<A NAME="921"></A>at the time when it was given, or afterwards on the arrival of the Samians. 
<A NAME="922"></A>For these last no sooner came to anchor off the island than they sent one 
<A NAME="923"></A>of their vessels, with an ambassage on board, to the city. All ships in 
<A NAME="924"></A>these early times were painted with vermilion; and this was what the Pythoness 
<A NAME="925"></A>had meant when she told them to beware of danger "from a wooden host, and 
<A NAME="926"></A>a herald in scarlet." So the ambassadors came ashore and besought the Siphnians 
<A NAME="927"></A>to lend them ten talents; but the Siphnians refused, whereupon the Samians 
<A NAME="928"></A>began to plunder their lands. Tidings of this reached the Siphnians, who 
<A NAME="929"></A>straightway sallied forth to save their crops; then a battle was fought, 
<A NAME="930"></A>in which the Siphnians suffered defeat, and many of their number were cut 
<A NAME="931"></A>off from the city by the Samians, after which these latter forced the Siphnians 
<A NAME="932"></A>to give them a hundred talents.
<A NAME="933"></A><BR><BR>With this money they bought of the Hermionians the island of Hydrea, 
<A NAME="934"></A>off the coast of the Peloponnese, and this they gave in trust to the Troezenians, 
<A NAME="935"></A>to keep for them, while they themselves went on to Crete, and founded the 
<A NAME="936"></A>city of Cydonia. They had not meant, when they set sail, to settle there, 
<A NAME="937"></A>but only to drive out the Zacynthians from the island. However they rested 
<A NAME="938"></A>at Cydonia, where they flourished greatly for five years. It was they who 
<A NAME="939"></A>built the various temples that may still be seen at that place, and among 
<A NAME="940"></A>them the fane of Dictyna. But in the sixth year they were attacked by the 
<A NAME="941"></A>Eginetans, who beat them in a sea-fight, and, with the help of the Cretans, 
<A NAME="942"></A>reduced them all to slavery. The beaks of their ships, which carried the 
<A NAME="943"></A>figure of a wild boar, they sawed off, and laid them up in the temple of 
<A NAME="944"></A>Minerva in Egina. The Eginetans took part against the Samians on account 
<A NAME="945"></A>of an ancient grudge, since the Samians had first, when Amphicrates was 
<A NAME="946"></A>king of Samos, made war on them and done great harm to their island, suffering, 
<A NAME="947"></A>however, much damage also themselves. Such was the reason which moved the 
<A NAME="948"></A>Eginetans to make this attack.
<A NAME="949"></A><BR><BR>I have dwelt the longer on the affairs of the Samians, because 
<A NAME="950"></A>three of the greatest works in all Greece were made by them. One is a tunnel, 
<A NAME="951"></A>under a hill one hundred and fifty fathoms high, carried entirely through 
<A NAME="952"></A>the base of the hill, with a mouth at either end. The length of the cutting 
<A NAME="953"></A>is seven furlongs- the height and width are each eight feet. Along the 
<A NAME="954"></A>whole course there is a second cutting, twenty cubits deep and three feet 
<A NAME="955"></A>broad, whereby water is brought, through pipes, from an abundant source 
<A NAME="956"></A>into the city. The architect of this tunnel was Eupalinus, son of Naustrophus, 
<A NAME="957"></A>a Megarian. Such is the first of their great works; the second is a mole 
<A NAME="958"></A>in the sea, which goes all round the harbour, near twenty fathoms deep, 
<A NAME="959"></A>and in length above two furlongs. The third is a temple; the largest of 
<A NAME="960"></A>all the temples known to us, whereof Rhoecus, son of Phileus, a Samian, 
<A NAME="961"></A>was first architect. Because of these works I have dwelt the longer on 
<A NAME="962"></A>the affairs of Samos.
<A NAME="963"></A><BR><BR>While Cambyses, son of Cyrus, after losing his senses, still lingered 
<A NAME="964"></A>in Egypt, two Magi, brothers, revolted against him. One of them had been 
<A NAME="965"></A>left in Persia by Cambyses as comptroller of his household; and it was 
<A NAME="966"></A>he who began the revolt. Aware that Smerdis was dead, and that his death 
<A NAME="967"></A>was hid and known to few of the Persians, while most believed that he was 
<A NAME="968"></A>still alive, he laid his plan, and made a bold stroke for the crown. He 
<A NAME="969"></A>had a brother- the same of whom I spoke before as his partner in the revolt- 
<A NAME="970"></A>who happened greatly to resemble Smerdis the son of Cyrus, whom Cambyses 
<A NAME="971"></A>his brother had put to death. And not only was this brother of his like 
<A NAME="972"></A>Smerdis in person, but he also bore the selfsame name, to wit Smerdis. 
<A NAME="973"></A>Patizeithes, the other Magus, having persuaded him that he would carry 
<A NAME="974"></A>the whole business through, took him and made him sit upon the royal throne. 
<A NAME="975"></A>Having so done, he sent heralds through all the land, to Egypt and elsewhere, 
<A NAME="976"></A>to make proclamation to the troops that henceforth they were to obey Smerdis 
<A NAME="977"></A>the son of Cyrus, and not Cambyses.
<A NAME="978"></A><BR><BR>The other heralds therefore made proclamation as they were ordered, 
<A NAME="979"></A>and likewise the herald whose place it was to proceed into Egypt. He, when 
<A NAME="980"></A>he reached Agbatana in Syria, finding Cambyses and his army there, went 
<A NAME="981"></A>straight into the middle of the host, and standing forth before them all, 
<A NAME="982"></A>made the proclamation which Patizeithes the Magus had commanded. Cambyses 
<A NAME="983"></A>no sooner heard him, than believing that what the herald said was true, 
<A NAME="984"></A>and imagining that he had been betrayed by Prexaspes (who, he supposed, 
<A NAME="985"></A>had not put Smerdis to death when sent into Persia for that purpose), he 
<A NAME="986"></A>turned his eyes full upon Prexaspes, and said, "Is this the way, Prexaspes, 
<A NAME="987"></A>that thou didst my errand?" "Oh! my liege," answered the other, "there 
<A NAME="988"></A>is no truth in the tidings that Smerdis thy brother has revolted against 
<A NAME="989"></A>thee, nor hast thou to fear in time to come any quarrel, great or small, 
<A NAME="990"></A>with that man. With my own hands I wrought thy will on him, and with my 
<A NAME="991"></A>own hands I buried him. If of a truth the dead can leave their graves, 
<A NAME="992"></A>expect Astyages the Mede to rise and fight against thee; but if the course 
<A NAME="993"></A>of nature be the same as formerly, then be sure no ill will ever come upon 
<A NAME="994"></A>thee from this quarter. Now, therefore, my counsel is that we send in pursuit 
<A NAME="995"></A>of the herald, and strictly question him who it was that charged him to 
<A NAME="996"></A>bid us obey king Smerdis."
<A NAME="997"></A><BR><BR>When Prexaspes had so spoken, and Cambyses had approved his words, 
<A NAME="998"></A>the herald was forthwith pursued, and brought back to the king. Then Prexaspes 
<A NAME="999"></A>said to him, "Sirrah, thou bear'st us a message, sayst thou, from Smerdis, 
<A NAME="1000"></A>son of Cyrus. Now answer truly, and go thy way scathless. Did Smerdis have 
<A NAME="1001"></A>thee to his presence and give thee thy orders, or hadst thou them from 
<A NAME="1002"></A>one of his officers?" The herald answered, "Truly I have not set eyes on 
<A NAME="1003"></A>Smerdis son of Cyrus, since the day when king Cambyses led the Persians 
<A NAME="1004"></A>into Egypt. The man who gave me my orders was the Magus that Cambyses left 
<A NAME="1005"></A>in charge of the household; but he said that Smerdis son of Cyrus sent 
<A NAME="1006"></A>you the message." In all this the herald spoke nothing but the strict truth. 
<A NAME="1007"></A>Then Cambyses said thus to Prexaspes:- "Thou art free from all blame, Prexaspes, 
<A NAME="1008"></A>since, as a right good man, thou hast not failed to do the thing which 
<A NAME="1009"></A>I commanded. But tell me now, which of the Persians can have taken the 
<A NAME="1010"></A>name of Smerdis, and revolted from me?" "I think, my liege," he answered, 
<A NAME="1011"></A>"that I apprehend the whole business. The men who have risen in revolt 
<A NAME="1012"></A>against thee are the two Magi, Patizeithes, who was left comptroller of 
<A NAME="1013"></A>thy household, and his brother, who is named Smerdis."
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR><BR>Cambyses no sooner heard the name of Smerdis than he was struck 
<A NAME="1015"></A>with the truth of Prexaspes' words, and the fulfilment of his own dream- 
<A NAME="1016"></A>the dream, I mean, which he had in former days, when one appeared to him 
<A NAME="1017"></A>in his sleep and told him that Smerdis sate upon the royal throne, and 
<A NAME="1018"></A>with his head touched the heavens. So when he saw that he had needlessly 
<A NAME="1019"></A>slain his brother Smerdis, he wept and bewailed his loss: after which, 
<A NAME="1020"></A>smarting with vexation as he thought of all his ill luck, he sprang hastily 
<A NAME="1021"></A>upon his steed, meaning to march his army with all haste to Susa against 
<A NAME="1022"></A>the Magus. As he made his spring, the button of his sword-sheath fell off, 
<A NAME="1023"></A>and the bared point entered his thigh, wounding him exactly where he had 
<A NAME="1024"></A>himself once wounded the Egyptian god Apis. Then Cambyses, feeling that 
<A NAME="1025"></A>he had got his death-wound, inquired the name of the place where he was, 
<A NAME="1026"></A>and was answered, "Agbatana." Now before this it had been told him by the 
<A NAME="1027"></A>oracle at Buto that he should end his days at Agbatana. He, however, had 
<A NAME="1028"></A>understood the Median Agbatana, where all his treasures were, and had thought 
<A NAME="1029"></A>that he should die there in a good old age; but the oracle meant Agbatana 
<A NAME="1030"></A>in Syria. So when Cambyses heard the name of the place, the double shock 
<A NAME="1031"></A>that he had received, from the revolt of the Magus and from his wound, 
<A NAME="1032"></A>brought him back to his senses. And he understood now the true meaning 
<A NAME="1033"></A>of the oracle, and said, "Here then Cambyses, son of Cyrus, is doomed to 
<A NAME="1034"></A>die."
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR><BR>At this time he said no more; but twenty days afterwards he called 
<A NAME="1036"></A>to his presence all the chief Persians who were with the army, and addressed 
<A NAME="1037"></A>them as follows:- "Persians, needs must I tell you now what hitherto I 
<A NAME="1038"></A>have striven with the greatest care to keep concealed. When I was in Egypt 
<A NAME="1039"></A>I saw in my sleep a vision, which would that I had never beheld! I thought 
<A NAME="1040"></A>a messenger came to me from my home, and told me that Smerdis sate upon 
<A NAME="1041"></A>the royal throne, and with his head touched the heavens. Then I feared 
<A NAME="1042"></A>to be cast from my throne by Smerdis my brother, and I did what was more 
<A NAME="1043"></A>hasty than wise. Ah! truly, do what they may, it is impossible for men 
<A NAME="1044"></A>to turn aside the coming fate. I, in my folly, sent Prexaspes to Susa to 
<A NAME="1045"></A>put my brother to death. So this great woe was accomplished, and I then 
<A NAME="1046"></A>lived without fear, never imagining that, after Smerdis was dead, I need 
<A NAME="1047"></A>dread revolt from any other. But herein I had quite mistaken what was about 
<A NAME="1048"></A>to happen, and so I slew my brother without any need, and nevertheless 
<A NAME="1049"></A>have lost my crown. For it was Smerdis the Magus, and not Smerdis my brother, 
<A NAME="1050"></A>of whose rebellion God forewarned me by the vision. The deed is done, however, 
<A NAME="1051"></A>and Smerdis, son of Cyrus, be sure is lost to you. The Magi have the royal 
<A NAME="1052"></A>power- Patizeithes, whom I left at Susa to overlook my household, and Smerdis 
<A NAME="1053"></A>his brother. There was one who would have been bound beyond all others 
<A NAME="1054"></A>to avenge the wrongs I have suffered from these Magians, but he, alas! 
<A NAME="1055"></A>has perished by a horrid fate, deprived of life by those nearest and dearest 
<A NAME="1056"></A>to him. In his default, nothing now remains for me but to tell you, O Persians, 
<A NAME="1057"></A>what I would wish to have done after I have breathed my last. Therefore, 
<A NAME="1058"></A>in the name of the gods that watch over our royal house, I charge you all, 
<A NAME="1059"></A>and specially such of you as are Achaemenids, that ye do not tamely allow 
<A NAME="1060"></A>the kingdom to go back to the Medes. Recover it one way or another, by 
<A NAME="1061"></A>force or fraud; by fraud, if it is by fraud that they have seized on it; 
<A NAME="1062"></A>by force, if force has helped them in their enterprise. Do this, and then 
<A NAME="1063"></A>may your land bring you forth fruit abundantly, and your wives bear children, 
<A NAME="1064"></A>and your herds increase, and freedom be your portion for ever: but do it 
<A NAME="1065"></A>not- make no brave struggle to regain the kingdom- and then my curse be
