<A NAME="10"></A><B>Euterpe</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>On the death of Cyrus, Cambyses his son by Cassandane daughter 
<A NAME="12"></A>of Pharnaspes took the kingdom. Cassandane had died in the lifetime of 
<A NAME="13"></A>Cyrus, who had made a great mourning for her at her death, and had commanded 
<A NAME="14"></A>all the subjects of his empire to observe the like. Cambyses, the son of 
<A NAME="15"></A>this lady and of Cyrus, regarding the Ionian and Aeolian Greeks as vassals 
<A NAME="16"></A>of his father, took them with him in his expedition against Egypt among 
<A NAME="17"></A>the other nations which owned his sway.
<A NAME="18"></A><BR><BR>Now the Egyptians, before the reign of their king Psammetichus, 
<A NAME="19"></A>believed themselves to be the most ancient of mankind. Since Psammetichus, 
<A NAME="20"></A>however, made an attempt to discover who were actually the primitive race, 
<A NAME="21"></A>they have been of opinion that while they surpass all other nations, the 
<A NAME="22"></A>Phrygians surpass them in antiquity. This king, finding it impossible to 
<A NAME="23"></A>make out by dint of inquiry what men were the most ancient, contrived the 
<A NAME="24"></A>following method of discovery:- He took two children of the common sort, 
<A NAME="25"></A>and gave them over to a herdsman to bring up at his folds, strictly charging 
<A NAME="26"></A>him to let no one utter a word in their presence, but to keep them in a 
<A NAME="27"></A>sequestered cottage, and from time to time introduce goats to their apartment, 
<A NAME="28"></A>see that they got their fill of milk, and in all other respects look after 
<A NAME="29"></A>them. His object herein was to know, after the indistinct babblings of 
<A NAME="30"></A>infancy were over, what word they would first articulate. It happened as 
<A NAME="31"></A>he had anticipated. The herdsman obeyed his orders for two years, and at 
<A NAME="32"></A>the end of that time, on his one day opening the door of their room and 
<A NAME="33"></A>going in, the children both ran up to him with outstretched arms, and distinctly 
<A NAME="34"></A>said "Becos." When this first happened the herdsman took no notice; but 
<A NAME="35"></A>afterwards when he observed, on coming often to see after them, that the 
<A NAME="36"></A>word was constantly in their mouths, he informed his lord, and by his command 
<A NAME="37"></A>brought the children into his presence. Psammetichus then himself heard 
<A NAME="38"></A>them say the word, upon which he proceeded to make inquiry what people 
<A NAME="39"></A>there was who called anything "becos," and hereupon he learnt that "becos" 
<A NAME="40"></A>was the Phrygian name for bread. In consideration of this circumstance 
<A NAME="41"></A>the Egyptians yielded their claims, and admitted the greater antiquity 
<A NAME="42"></A>of the Phrygians.
<A NAME="43"></A><BR><BR>That these were the real facts I learnt at Memphis from the priests 
<A NAME="44"></A>of Vulcan. The Greeks, among other foolish tales, relate that Psammetichus 
<A NAME="45"></A>had the children brought up by women whose tongues he had previously cut 
<A NAME="46"></A>out; but the priests said their bringing up was such as I have stated above. 
<A NAME="47"></A>I got much other information also from conversation with these priests 
<A NAME="48"></A>while I was at Memphis, and I even went to Heliopolis and to Thebes, expressly 
<A NAME="49"></A>to try whether the priests of those places would agree in their accounts 
<A NAME="50"></A>with the priests at Memphis. The Heliopolitans have the reputation of being 
<A NAME="51"></A>the best skilled in history of all the Egyptians. What they told me concerning 
<A NAME="52"></A>their religion it is not my intention to repeat, except the names of their 
<A NAME="53"></A>deities, which I believe all men know equally. If I relate anything else 
<A NAME="54"></A>concerning these matters, it will only be when compelled to do so by the 
<A NAME="55"></A>course of my narrative.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR>Now with regard to mere human matters, the accounts which they 
<A NAME="57"></A>gave, and in which all agreed, were the following. The Egyptians, they 
<A NAME="58"></A>said, were the first to discover the solar year, and to portion out its 
<A NAME="59"></A>course into twelve parts. They obtained this knowledge from the stars. 
<A NAME="60"></A>(To my mind they contrive their year much more cleverly than the Greeks, 
<A NAME="61"></A>for these last every other year intercalate a whole month, but the Egyptians, 
<A NAME="62"></A>dividing the year into twelve months of thirty days each, add every year 
<A NAME="63"></A>a space of five days besides, whereby the circuit of the seasons is made 
<A NAME="64"></A>to return with uniformity.) The Egyptians, they went on to affirm, first 
<A NAME="65"></A>brought into use the names of the twelve gods, which the Greeks adopted 
<A NAME="66"></A>from them; and first erected altars, images, and temples to the gods; and 
<A NAME="67"></A>also first engraved upon stone the figures of animals. In most of these 
<A NAME="68"></A>cases they proved to me that what they said was true. And they told me 
<A NAME="69"></A>that the first man who ruled over Egypt was Min, and that in his time all 
<A NAME="70"></A>Egypt, except the Thebaic canton, was a marsh, none of the land below Lake 
<A NAME="71"></A>Moeris then showing itself above the surface of the water. This is a distance 
<A NAME="72"></A>of seven days' sail from the sea up the river.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>What they said of their country seemed to me very reasonable. For 
<A NAME="74"></A>any one who sees Egypt, without having heard a word about it before, must 
<A NAME="75"></A>perceive, if he has only common powers of observation, that the Egypt to 
<A NAME="76"></A>which the Greeks go in their ships is an acquired country, the gift of 
<A NAME="77"></A>the river. The same is true of the land above the lake, to the distance 
<A NAME="78"></A>of three days' voyage, concerning which the Egyptians say nothing, but 
<A NAME="79"></A>which exactly the same kind of country.
<A NAME="80"></A><BR><BR>The following is the general character of the region. In the first 
<A NAME="81"></A>place, on approaching it by sea, when you are still a day's sail from the 
<A NAME="82"></A>land, if you let down a sounding-line you will bring up mud, and find yourself 
<A NAME="83"></A>in eleven fathoms' water, which shows that the soil washed down by the 
<A NAME="84"></A>stream extends to that distance.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>The length of the country along shore, according to the bounds 
<A NAME="86"></A>that we assign to Egypt, namely from the Plinthinetic gulf to Lake Serbonis, 
<A NAME="87"></A>which extends along the base of Mount Casius, is sixty schoenes. The nations 
<A NAME="88"></A>whose territories are scanty measure them by the fathom; those whose bounds 
<A NAME="89"></A>are less confined, by the furlong; those who have an ample territory, by 
<A NAME="90"></A>the parasang; but if men have a country which is very vast, they measure 
<A NAME="91"></A>it by the schoene. Now the length of the parasang is thirty furlongs, but 
<A NAME="92"></A>the schoene, which is an Egyptian measure, is sixty furlongs. Thus the 
<A NAME="93"></A>coastline of Egypt would extend a length of three thousand six hundred 
<A NAME="94"></A>furlongs.
<A NAME="95"></A><BR><BR>From the coast inland as far as Heliopolis the breadth of Egypt 
<A NAME="96"></A>is considerable, the country is flat, without springs, and full of swamps. 
<A NAME="97"></A>The length of the route from the sea up to Heliopolis is almost exactly 
<A NAME="98"></A>the same as that of the road which runs from the altar of the twelve gods 
<A NAME="99"></A>at Athens to the temple of Olympian Jove at Pisa. If a person made a calculation 
<A NAME="100"></A>he would find but a very little difference between the two routes, not 
<A NAME="101"></A>more than about fifteen furlongs; for the road from Athens to Pisa falls 
<A NAME="102"></A>short of fifteen hundred furlongs by exactly fifteen, whereas the distance 
<A NAME="103"></A>of Heliopolis from the sea is just the round number.
<A NAME="104"></A><BR><BR>As one proceeds beyond Heliopolis up the country, Egypt becomes 
<A NAME="105"></A>narrow, the Arabian range of hills, which has a direction from north to 
<A NAME="106"></A>south, shutting it in upon the one side, and the Libyan range upon the 
<A NAME="107"></A>other. The former ridge runs on without a break, and stretches away to 
<A NAME="108"></A>the sea called the Erythraean; it contains the quarries whence the stone 
<A NAME="109"></A>was cut for the pyramids of Memphis: and this is the point where it ceases 
<A NAME="110"></A>its first direction, and bends away in the manner above indicated. In its 
<A NAME="111"></A>greatest length from east to west it is, as I have been informed, a distance 
<A NAME="112"></A>of two months' journey towards the extreme east its skirts produce frankincense. 
<A NAME="113"></A>Such are the chief features of this range. On the Libyan side, the other 
<A NAME="114"></A>ridge whereon the pyramids stand is rocky and covered with sand; its direction 
<A NAME="115"></A>is the same as that of the Arabian ridge in the first part of its course. 
<A NAME="116"></A>Above Heliopolis, then, there is no great breadth of territory for such 
<A NAME="117"></A>a country as Egypt, but during four days' sail Egypt is narrow; the valley 
<A NAME="118"></A>between the two ranges is a level plain, and seemed to me to be, at the 
<A NAME="119"></A>narrowest point, not more than two hundred furlongs across from the Arabian 
<A NAME="120"></A>to the Libyan hills. Above this point Egypt again widens.
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR>From Heliopolis to Thebes is nine days' sail up the river; the 
<A NAME="122"></A>distance is eighty-one schoenes, or 4860 furlongs. If we now put together 
<A NAME="123"></A>the several measurements of the country we shall find that the distance 
<A NAME="124"></A>along shore is, as I stated above, 3600 furlongs, and the distance from 
<A NAME="125"></A>the sea inland to Thebes 6120 furlongs. Further, it is a distance of eighteen 
<A NAME="126"></A>hundred furlongs from Thebes to the place called Elephantine.
<A NAME="127"></A><BR><BR>The greater portion of the country above described seemed to me 
<A NAME="128"></A>to be, as the priests declared, a tract gained by the inhabitants. For 
<A NAME="129"></A>the whole region above Memphis, lying between the two ranges of hills that 
<A NAME="130"></A>have been spoken of, appeared evidently to have formed at one time a gulf 
<A NAME="131"></A>of the sea. It resembles (to compare small things with great) the parts 
<A NAME="132"></A>about Ilium and Teuthrania, Ephesus, and the plain of the Maeander. In 
<A NAME="133"></A>all these regions the land has been formed by rivers, whereof the greatest 
<A NAME="134"></A>is not to compare for size with any one of the five mouths of the Nile. 
<A NAME="135"></A>I could mention other rivers also, far inferior to the Nile in magnitude, 
<A NAME="136"></A>that have effected very great changes. Among these not the least is the 
<A NAME="137"></A>Achelous, which, after passing through Acarnania, empties itself into the 
<A NAME="138"></A>sea opposite the islands called Echinades, and has already joined one-half 
<A NAME="139"></A>of them to the continent.
<A NAME="140"></A><BR><BR>In Arabia, not far from Egypt, there is a long and narrow gulf 
<A NAME="141"></A>running inland from the sea called the Erythraean, of which I will here 
<A NAME="142"></A>set down the dimensions. Starting from its innermost recess, and using 
<A NAME="143"></A>a row-boat, you take forty days to reach the open main, while you may cross 
<A NAME="144"></A>the gulf at its widest part in the space of half a day. In this sea there 
<A NAME="145"></A>is an ebb and flow of the tide every day. My opinion is that Egypt was 
<A NAME="146"></A>formerly very much such a gulf as this- one gulf penetrated from the sea 
<A NAME="147"></A>that washes Egypt on the north, and extended itself towards Ethiopia; another 
<A NAME="148"></A>entered from the southern ocean, and stretched towards Syria; the two gulfs 
<A NAME="149"></A>ran into the land so as almost to meet each other, and left between them 
<A NAME="150"></A>only a very narrow tract of country. Now if the Nile should choose to divert 
<A NAME="151"></A>his waters from their present bed into this Arabian gulf, what is there 
<A NAME="152"></A>to hinder it from being filled up by the stream within, at the utmost, 
<A NAME="153"></A>twenty thousand years? For my part, I think it would be filled in half 
<A NAME="154"></A>the time. How then should not a gulf, even of much greater size, have been 
<A NAME="155"></A>filled up in the ages that passed before I was born, by a river that is 
<A NAME="156"></A>at once so large and so given to working changes?
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR>Thus I give credit to those from whom I received this account of 
<A NAME="158"></A>Egypt, and am myself, moreover, strongly of the same opinion, since I remarked 
<A NAME="159"></A>that the country projects into the sea further than the neighbouring shores, 
<A NAME="160"></A>and I observed that there were shells upon the hills, and that salt exuded 
<A NAME="161"></A>from the soil to such an extent as even to injure the pyramids; and I noticed 
<A NAME="162"></A>also that there is but a single hill in all Egypt where sand is found, 
<A NAME="163"></A>namely, the hill above Memphis; and further, I found the country to bear 
<A NAME="164"></A>no resemblance either to its borderland Arabia, or to Libya- nay, nor even 
<A NAME="165"></A>to Syria, which forms the seaboard of Arabia; but whereas the soil of Libya 
<A NAME="166"></A>is, we know, sandy and of a reddish hue, and that of Arabia and Syria inclines 
<A NAME="167"></A>to stone and clay, Egypt has a soil that is black and crumbly, as being 
<A NAME="168"></A>alluvial and formed of the deposits brought down by the river from 
<A NAME="169"></A>Ethiopia.
<A NAME="170"></A><BR><BR>One fact which I learnt of the priests is to me a strong evidence 
<A NAME="171"></A>of the origin of the country. They said that when Moeris was king, the 
<A NAME="172"></A>Nile overflowed all Egypt below Memphis, as soon as it rose so little as 
<A NAME="173"></A>eight cubits. Now Moeris had not been dead 900 years at the time when I 
<A NAME="174"></A>heard this of the priests; yet at the present day, unless the river rise 
<A NAME="175"></A>sixteen, or, at the very least, fifteen cubits, it does not overflow the 
<A NAME="176"></A>lands. It seems to me, therefore, that if the land goes on rising and growing 
<A NAME="177"></A>at this rate, the Egyptians who dwell below Lake Moeris, in the Delta (as 
<A NAME="178"></A>it is called) and elsewhere, will one day, by the stoppage of the inundations, 
<A NAME="179"></A>suffer permanently the fate which they told me they expected would some 
<A NAME="180"></A>time or other befall the Greeks. On hearing that the whole land of Greece 
<A NAME="181"></A>is watered by rain from heaven, and not, like their own, inundated by rivers, 
<A NAME="182"></A>they observed- "Some day the Greeks will be disappointed of their grand 
<A NAME="183"></A>hope, and then they will be wretchedly hungry"; which was as much as to 
<A NAME="184"></A>say, "If God shall some day see fit not to grant the Greeks rain, but shall 
<A NAME="185"></A>afflict them with a long drought, the Greeks will be swept away by a famine, 
<A NAME="186"></A>since they have nothing to rely on but rain from Jove, and have no other 
<A NAME="187"></A>resource for water."
<A NAME="188"></A><BR><BR>And certes, in thus speaking of the Greeks the Egyptians say nothing 
<A NAME="189"></A>but what is true. But now let me tell the Egyptians how the case stands 
<A NAME="190"></A>with themselves. If, as I said before, the country below Memphis, which 
<A NAME="191"></A>is the land that is always rising, continues to increase in height at the 
<A NAME="192"></A>rate at which it has risen in times gone by, how will it be possible for 
<A NAME="193"></A>the inhabitants of that region to avoid hunger, when they will certainly 
<A NAME="194"></A>have no rain, and the river will not be able to overflow their cornlands? 
<A NAME="195"></A>At present, it must be confessed, they obtain the fruits of the field with 
<A NAME="196"></A>less trouble than any other people in the world, the rest of the Egyptians 
<A NAME="197"></A>included, since they have no need to break up the ground with the plough, 
<A NAME="198"></A>nor to use the hoe, nor to do any of the work which the rest of mankind 
<A NAME="199"></A>find necessary if they are to get a crop; but the husbandman waits till 
<A NAME="200"></A>the river has of its own accord spread itself over the fields and withdrawn 
<A NAME="201"></A>again to its bed, and then sows his plot of ground, and after sowing turns 
<A NAME="202"></A>his swine into it- the swine tread in the corn- after which he has only 
<A NAME="203"></A>to await the harvest. The swine serve him also to thrash the grain, which 
<A NAME="204"></A>is then carried to the garner.
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR>If then we choose to adopt the views of the Ionians concerning 
<A NAME="206"></A>Egypt, we must come to the conclusion that the Egyptians had formerly no 
<A NAME="207"></A>country at all. For the Ionians say that nothing is really Egypt but the 
<A NAME="208"></A>Delta, which extends along shore from the Watch-tower of Perseus, as it 
<A NAME="209"></A>is called, to the Pelusiac Salt-Pans, a distance of forty schoenes, and 
<A NAME="210"></A>stretches inland as far as the city of Cercasorus, where the Nile divides 
<A NAME="211"></A>into the two streams which reach the sea at Pelusium and Canobus respectively. 
<A NAME="212"></A>The rest of what is accounted Egypt belongs, they say, either to Arabia 
<A NAME="213"></A>or Libya. But the Delta, as the Egyptians affirm, and as I myself am persuaded, 
<A NAME="214"></A>is formed of the deposits of the river, and has only recently, if I may 
<A NAME="215"></A>use the expression, come to light. If, then, they had formerly no territory 
<A NAME="216"></A>at all, how came they to be so extravagant as to fancy themselves the most 
<A NAME="217"></A>ancient race in the world? Surely there was no need of their making the 
<A NAME="218"></A>experiment with the children to see what language they would first speak. 
<A NAME="219"></A>But in truth I do not believe that the Egyptians came into being at the 
<A NAME="220"></A>same time with the Delta, as the Ionians call it; I think they have always 
<A NAME="221"></A>existed ever since the human race began; as the land went on increasing, 
<A NAME="222"></A>part of the population came down into the new country, part remained in 
<A NAME="223"></A>their old settlements. In ancient times the Thebais bore the name of Egypt, 
<A NAME="224"></A>a district of which the entire circumference is but 6120 
<A NAME="225"></A>furlongs.
<A NAME="226"></A><BR><BR>If, then, my judgment on these matters be right, the Ionians are 
<A NAME="227"></A>mistaken in what they say of Egypt. If, on the contrary, it is they who 
<A NAME="228"></A>are right, then I undertake to show that neither the Ionians nor any of 
<A NAME="229"></A>the other Greeks know how to count. For they all say that the earth is 
<A NAME="230"></A>divided into three parts, Europe, Asia, and Libya, whereas they ought to 
<A NAME="231"></A>add a fourth part, the Delta of Egypt, since they do not include it either 
<A NAME="232"></A>in Asia or Libya. For is it not their theory that the Nile separates Asia 
<A NAME="233"></A>from Libya? As the Nile, therefore, splits in two at the apex of the Delta, 
<A NAME="234"></A>the Delta itself must be a separate country, not contained in either Asia 
<A NAME="235"></A>or Libya.
<A NAME="236"></A><BR><BR>Here I take my leave of the opinions of the Ionians, and proceed 
<A NAME="237"></A>to deliver my own sentiments on these subjects. I consider Egypt to be 
<A NAME="238"></A>the whole country inhabited by the Egyptians, just as Cilicia is the tract 
<A NAME="239"></A>occupied by the Cilicians, and Assyria that possessed by the Assyrians. 
<A NAME="240"></A>And I regard the only proper boundary-line between Libya and Asia to be 
<A NAME="241"></A>that which is marked out by the Egyptian frontier. For if we take the boundary-line 
<A NAME="242"></A>commonly received by the Greeks, we must regard Egypt as divided, along 
<A NAME="243"></A>its whole length from Elephantine and the Cataracts to Cercasorus, into 
<A NAME="244"></A>two parts, each belonging to a different portion of the world, one to Asia, 
<A NAME="245"></A>the other to Libya; since the Nile divides Egypt in two from the Cataracts 
<A NAME="246"></A>to the sea, running as far as the city of Cercasorus in a single stream, 
<A NAME="247"></A>but at that point separating into three branches, whereof the one which 
<A NAME="248"></A>bends eastward is called the Pelusiac mouth, and that which slants to the 
<A NAME="249"></A>west, the Canobic. Meanwhile the straight course of the stream, which comes 
<A NAME="250"></A>down from the upper country and meets the apex of the Delta, continues 
<A NAME="251"></A>on, dividing the Delta down the middle, and empties itself into the sea 
<A NAME="252"></A>by a mouth, which is as celebrated, and carries as large a body of water, 
<A NAME="253"></A>as most of the others, the mouth called the Sebennytic. Besides these there 
<A NAME="254"></A>are two other mouths which run out of the Sebennytic called respectively 
<A NAME="255"></A>the Saitic and the Mendesian. The Bolbitine mouth, and the Bucolic, are 
<A NAME="256"></A>not natural branches, but channels made by excavation.
<A NAME="257"></A><BR><BR>My judgment as to the extent of Egypt is confirmed by an oracle 
<A NAME="258"></A>delivered at the shrine of Ammon, of which I had no knowledge at all until 
<A NAME="259"></A>after I had formed my opinion. It happened that the people of the cities 
<A NAME="260"></A>Marea and Apis, who live in the part of Egypt that borders on Libya, took 
<A NAME="261"></A>a dislike to the religious usages of the country concerning sacrificial 
<A NAME="262"></A>animals, and wished no longer to be restricted from eating the flesh of 
<A NAME="263"></A>cows. So, as they believed themselves to be Libyans and not Egyptians, 
<A NAME="264"></A>they sent to the shrine to say that, having nothing in common with the 
<A NAME="265"></A>Egyptians, neither inhabiting the Delta nor using the Egyptian tongue, 
<A NAME="266"></A>they claimed to be allowed to eat whatever they pleased. Their request, 
<A NAME="267"></A>however, was refused by the god, who declared in reply that Egypt was the 
<A NAME="268"></A>entire tract of country which the Nile overspreads and irrigates, and the 
<A NAME="269"></A>Egyptians were the people who lived below Elephantine, and drank the waters 
<A NAME="270"></A>of that river.
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>So said the oracle. Now the Nile, when it overflows, floods not 
<A NAME="272"></A>only the Delta, but also the tracts of country on both sides the stream 
<A NAME="273"></A>which are thought to belong to Libya and Arabia, in some places reaching 
<A NAME="274"></A>to the extent of two days' journey from its banks, in some even exceeding 
<A NAME="275"></A>that distance, but in others falling short of it.
<A NAME="276"></A><BR><BR>Concerning the nature of the river, I was not able to gain any 
<A NAME="277"></A>information either from the priests or from others. I was particularly 
<A NAME="278"></A>anxious to learn from them why the Nile, at the commencement of the summer 
<A NAME="279"></A>solstice, begins to rise, and continues to increase for a hundred days- 
<A NAME="280"></A>and why, as soon as that number is past, it forthwith retires and contracts 
<A NAME="281"></A>its stream, continuing low during the whole of the winter until the summer 
<A NAME="282"></A>solstice comes round again. On none of these points could I obtain any 
<A NAME="283"></A>explanation from the inhabitants, though I made every inquiry, wishing 
<A NAME="284"></A>to know what was commonly reported- they could neither tell me what special 
<A NAME="285"></A>virtue the Nile has which makes it so opposite in its nature to all other 
<A NAME="286"></A>streams, nor why, unlike every other river, it gives forth no breezes from 
<A NAME="287"></A>its surface.
<A NAME="288"></A><BR><BR>Some of the Greeks, however, wishing to get a reputation for cleverness, 
<A NAME="289"></A>have offered explanations of the phenomena of the river, for which they 
<A NAME="290"></A>have accounted in three different ways. Two of these I do not think it 
<A NAME="291"></A>worth while to speak of, further than simply to mention what they are. 
<A NAME="292"></A>One pretends that the Etesian winds cause the rise of the river by preventing 
<A NAME="293"></A>the Nile-water from running off into the sea. But in the first place it 
<A NAME="294"></A>has often happened, when the Etesian winds did not blow, that the Nile 
<A NAME="295"></A>has risen according to its usual wont; and further, if the Etesian winds 
<A NAME="296"></A>produced the effect, the other rivers which flow in a direction opposite 
<A NAME="297"></A>to those winds ought to present the same phenomena as the Nile, and the 
<A NAME="298"></A>more so as they are all smaller streams, and have a weaker current. But 
<A NAME="299"></A>these rivers, of which there are many both in Syria and Libya, are entirely 
<A NAME="300"></A>unlike the Nile in this respect.
<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR>The second opinion is even more unscientific than the one just 
<A NAME="302"></A>mentioned, and also, if I may so say, more marvellous. It is that the Nile 
<A NAME="303"></A>acts so strangely, because it flows from the ocean, and that the ocean 
<A NAME="304"></A>flows all round the earth.
<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR>The third explanation, which is very much more plausible than either 
<A NAME="306"></A>of the others, is positively the furthest from the truth; for there is 
<A NAME="307"></A>really nothing in what it says, any more than in the other theories. It 
<A NAME="308"></A>is, that the inundation of the Nile is caused by the melting of snows. 
<A NAME="309"></A>Now, as the Nile flows out of Libya, through Ethiopia, into Egypt, how 
<A NAME="310"></A>is it possible that it can be formed of melted snow, running, as it does, 
<A NAME="311"></A>from the hottest regions of the world into cooler countries? Many are the 
<A NAME="312"></A>proofs whereby any one capable of reasoning on the subject may be convinced 
<A NAME="313"></A>that it is most unlikely this should be the case. The first and strongest 
<A NAME="314"></A>argument is furnished by the winds, which always blow hot from these regions. 
<A NAME="315"></A>The second is that rain and frost are unknown there. Now whenever snow 
<A NAME="316"></A>falls, it must of necessity rain within five days;.so that, if there were 
<A NAME="317"></A>snow, there must be rain also in those parts. Thirdly, it is certain that 
<A NAME="318"></A>the natives of the country are black with the heat, that the kites and 
<A NAME="319"></A>the swallows remain there the whole year, and that the cranes, when they 
<A NAME="320"></A>fly from the rigours of a Scythian winter, flock thither to pass the cold 
<A NAME="321"></A>season. If then, in the country whence the Nile has its source, or in that 
<A NAME="322"></A>through which it flows, there fell ever so little snow, it is absolutely 
<A NAME="323"></A>impossible that any of these circumstances could take 
<A NAME="324"></A>place.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR>As for the writer who attributes the phenomenon to the ocean, his 
<A NAME="326"></A>account is involved in such obscurity that it is impossible to disprove 
<A NAME="327"></A>it by argument. For my part I know of no river called Ocean, and I think 
<A NAME="328"></A>that Homer, or one of the earlier poets, invented the name, and introduced 
<A NAME="329"></A>it into his poetry.
<A NAME="330"></A><BR><BR>Perhaps, after censuring all the opinions that have been put forward 
<A NAME="331"></A>on this obscure subject, one ought to propose some theory of one's own. 
<A NAME="332"></A>I will therefore proceed to explain what I think to be the reason of the 
<A NAME="333"></A>Nile's swelling in the summer time. During the winter, the sun is driven 
<A NAME="334"></A>out of his usual course by the storms, and removes to the upper parts of 
<A NAME="335"></A>Libya. This is the whole secret in the fewest possible words; for it stands 
<A NAME="336"></A>to reason that the country to which the Sun-god approaches the nearest, 
<A NAME="337"></A>and which he passes most directly over, will be scantest of water, and 
<A NAME="338"></A>that there the streams which feed the rivers will shrink the 
<A NAME="339"></A>most.
<A NAME="340"></A><BR><BR>To explain, however, more at length, the case is this. The sun, 
<A NAME="341"></A>in his passage across the upper parts of Libya, affects them in the following 
<A NAME="342"></A>way. As the air in those regions is constantly clear, and the country warm 
<A NAME="343"></A>through the absence of cold winds, the sun in his passage across them acts 
<A NAME="344"></A>upon them exactly as he wont to act elsewhere in summer, when his path 
<A NAME="345"></A>is in the middle of heaven- that is, he attracts the water. After attracting 
<A NAME="346"></A>it, he again repels it into the upper regions, where the winds lay hold 
<A NAME="347"></A>of it, scatter it, and reduce it to a vapour, whence it naturally enough 
<A NAME="348"></A>comes to pass that the winds which blow from this quarter- the south and 
<A NAME="349"></A>south-west- are of all winds the most rainy. And my own opinion is that 
<A NAME="350"></A>the sun does not get rid of all the water which he draws year by year from 
<A NAME="351"></A>the Nile, but retains some about him. When the winter begins to soften, 
<A NAME="352"></A>the sun goes back again to his old place in the middle of the heaven, and 
<A NAME="353"></A>proceeds to attract water equally from all countries. Till then the other 
<A NAME="354"></A>rivers run big, from the quantity of rain-water which they bring down from 
<A NAME="355"></A>countries where so much moisture falls that all the land is cut into gullies; 
<A NAME="356"></A>but in summer, when the showers fail, and the sun attracts their water, 
<A NAME="357"></A>they become low. The Nile, on the contrary, not deriving any of its bulk 
<A NAME="358"></A>from rains, and being in winter subject to the attraction of the sun, naturally 
<A NAME="359"></A>runs at that season, unlike all other streams, with a less burthen of water 
<A NAME="360"></A>than in the summer time. For in summer it is exposed to attraction equally 
<A NAME="361"></A>with all other rivers, but in winter it suffers alone. The sun, therefore, 
<A NAME="362"></A>I regard as the sole cause of the phenomenon.
<A NAME="363"></A><BR><BR>It is the sun also, in my opinion, which, by heating the space 
<A NAME="364"></A>through which it passes, makes the air in Egypt so dry. There is thus perpetual 
<A NAME="365"></A>summer in the upper parts of Libya. Were the position of the heavenly regions 
<A NAME="366"></A>reversed, so that the place where now the north wind and the winter have 
<A NAME="367"></A>their dwelling became the station of the south wind and of the noon-day, 
<A NAME="368"></A>while, on the other hand, the station of the south wind became that of 
<A NAME="369"></A>the north, the consequence would be that the sun, driven from the mid-heaven 
<A NAME="370"></A>by the winter and the northern gales, would betake himself to the upper 
<A NAME="371"></A>parts of Europe, as he now does to those of Libya, and then I believe his 
<A NAME="372"></A>passage across Europe would affect the Ister exactly as the Nile is affected 
<A NAME="373"></A>at the present day.
<A NAME="374"></A><BR><BR>And with respect to the fact that no breeze blows from the Nile, 
<A NAME="375"></A>I am of opinion that no wind is likely to arise in very hot countries, 
<A NAME="376"></A>for breezes love to blow from some cold quarter.
<A NAME="377"></A><BR><BR>Let us leave these things, however, to their natural course, to 
<A NAME="378"></A>continue as they are and have been from the beginning. With regard to the 
<A NAME="379"></A>sources of the Nile, I have found no one among all those with whom I have 
<A NAME="380"></A>conversed, whether Egyptians, Libyans, or Greeks, who professed to have 
<A NAME="381"></A>any knowledge, except a single person. He was the scribe who kept the register 
<A NAME="382"></A>of the sacred treasures of Minerva in the city of Sais, and he did not 
<A NAME="383"></A>seem to me to be in earnest when he said that he knew them perfectly well. 
<A NAME="384"></A>His story was as follows:- "Between Syene, a city of the Thebais, and Elephantine, 
<A NAME="385"></A>there are" (he said) "two hills with sharp conical tops; the name of the 
<A NAME="386"></A>one is Crophi, of the other, Mophi. Midway between them are the fountains 
<A NAME="387"></A>of the Nile, fountains which it is impossible to fathom. Half the water 
<A NAME="388"></A>runs northward into Egypt, half to the south towards Ethiopia." The fountains 
<A NAME="389"></A>were known to be unfathomable, he declared, because Psammetichus, an Egyptian 
<A NAME="390"></A>king, had made trial of them. He had caused a rope to be made, many thousand 
<A NAME="391"></A>fathoms in length, and had sounded the fountain with it, but could find 
<A NAME="392"></A>no bottom. By this the scribe gave me to understand, if there was any truth 
<A NAME="393"></A>at all in what he said, that in this fountain there are certain strong 
<A NAME="394"></A>eddies, and a regurgitation, owing to the force wherewith the water dashes 
<A NAME="395"></A>against the mountains, and hence a Sounding-line cannot be got to reach 
<A NAME="396"></A>the bottom of the spring.
<A NAME="397"></A><BR><BR>No other information on this head could I obtain from any quarter. 
<A NAME="398"></A>All that I succeeded in learning further of the more distant portions of 
<A NAME="399"></A>the Nile, by ascending myself as high as Elephantine and making inquiries 
<A NAME="400"></A>concerning the parts beyond, was the following:- As one advances beyond 
<A NAME="401"></A>Elephantine, the land rises. Hence it is necessary in this part of the 
<A NAME="402"></A>river to attach a rope to the boat on each side, as men harness an ox, 
<A NAME="403"></A>and so proceed on the journey. If the rope snaps, the vessel is borne away 
<A NAME="404"></A>down stream by the force of the current. The navigation continues the same 
<A NAME="405"></A>for four days, the river winding greatly, like the Maeander, and the distance 
<A NAME="406"></A>traversed amounting to twelve schoenes. Here you come upon a smooth and 
<A NAME="407"></A>level plain, where the Nile flows in two branches, round an island called 
<A NAME="408"></A>Tachompso. The country above Elephantine is inhabited by the Ethiopians, 
<A NAME="409"></A>who possess one-half of this island, the Egyptians occupying the other. 
<A NAME="410"></A>Above the island there is a great lake, the shores of which are inhabited 
<A NAME="411"></A>by Ethiopian nomads; after passing it, you come again to the stream of 
<A NAME="412"></A>the Nile, which runs into the lake. Here you land, and travel for forty 
<A NAME="413"></A>days along the banks of the river, since it is impossible to proceed further 
<A NAME="414"></A>in a boat on account of the sharp peaks which jut out from the water, and 
<A NAME="415"></A>the sunken rocks which abound in that part of the stream. When you have 
<A NAME="416"></A>passed this portion of the river in the space of forty days, you go on 
<A NAME="417"></A>board another boat and proceed by water for twelve days more, at the end 
<A NAME="418"></A>of which time you reach a great city called Meroe, which is said to be 
<A NAME="419"></A>the capital of the other Ethiopians. The only gods worshipped by the inhabitants 
<A NAME="420"></A>are Jupiter and Bacchus, to whom great honours are paid. There is an oracle 
<A NAME="421"></A>of Jupiter in the city, which directs the warlike expeditions of the Ethiopians; 
<A NAME="422"></A>when it commands they go to war, and in whatever direction it bids them 
<A NAME="423"></A>march, thither straightway they carry their arms.
<A NAME="424"></A><BR><BR>On leaving this city, and again mounting the stream, in the same 
<A NAME="425"></A>space of time which it took you to reach the capital from Elephantine, 
<A NAME="426"></A>you come to the Deserters, who bear the name of Asmach. This word, translated 
<A NAME="427"></A>into our language, means "the men who stand on the left hand of the king." 
<A NAME="428"></A>These Deserters are Egyptians of the warrior caste, who, to the number 
<A NAME="429"></A>of two hundred and forty thousand, went over to the Ethiopians in the reign 
<A NAME="430"></A>of king Psammetichus. The cause of their desertion was the following:- 
<A NAME="431"></A>Three garrisons were maintained in Egypt at that time, one in the city 
<A NAME="432"></A>of Elephantine against the Ethiopians, another in the Pelusiac Daphnae, 
<A NAME="433"></A>against the Syrians and Arabians, and a third, against the Libyans, in 
<A NAME="434"></A>Marea. (The very same posts are to this day occupied by the Persians, whose 
<A NAME="435"></A>forces are in garrison both in Daphnae and in Elephantine.) Now it happened, 
<A NAME="436"></A>that on one occasion the garrisons were not relieved during the space of 
<A NAME="437"></A>three years; the soldiers, therefore, at the end of that time, consulted 
<A NAME="438"></A>together, and having determined by common consent to revolt, marched away 
<A NAME="439"></A>towards Ethiopia. Psammetichus, informed of the movement, set out in pursuit, 
<A NAME="440"></A>and coming up with them, besought them with many words not to desert the 
<A NAME="441"></A>gods of their country, nor abandon their wives and children. "Nay, but," 
<A NAME="442"></A>said one of the deserters with an unseemly gesture, "wherever we go, we 
<A NAME="443"></A>are sure enough of finding wives and children." Arrived in Ethiopia, they 
<A NAME="444"></A>placed themselves at the disposal of the king. In return, he made them 
<A NAME="445"></A>a present of a tract of land which belonged to certain Ethiopians with 
<A NAME="446"></A>whom he was at feud, bidding them expel the inhabitants and take possession 
<A NAME="447"></A>of their territory. From the time that this settlement was formed, their 
<A NAME="448"></A>acquaintance with Egyptian manners has tended to civilise the 
<A NAME="449"></A>Ethiopians.
<A NAME="450"></A><BR><BR>Thus the course of the Nile is known, not only throughout Egypt, 
<A NAME="451"></A>but to the extent of four months' journey either by land or water above 
<A NAME="452"></A>the Egyptian boundary; for on calculation it will be found that it takes 
<A NAME="453"></A>that length of time to travel from Elephantine to the country of the Deserters. 
<A NAME="454"></A>There the direction of the river is from west to east. Beyond, no one has 
<A NAME="455"></A>any certain knowledge of its course, since the country is uninhabited by 
<A NAME="456"></A>reason of the excessive heat.
<A NAME="457"></A><BR><BR>I did hear, indeed, what I will now relate, from certain natives 
<A NAME="458"></A>of Cyrene. Once upon a time, they said, they were on a visit to the oracular 
<A NAME="459"></A>shrine of Ammon, when it chanced that in the course of conversation with 
<A NAME="460"></A>Etearchus, the Ammonian king, the talk fell upon the Nile, how that its 
<A NAME="461"></A>sources were unknown to all men. Etearchus upon this mentioned that some 
<A NAME="462"></A>Nasamonians had once come to his court, and when asked if they could give 
<A NAME="463"></A>any information concerning the uninhabited parts of Libya, had told the 
<A NAME="464"></A>following tale. (The Nasamonians are a Libyan race who occupy the Syrtis, 
<A NAME="465"></A>and a tract of no great size towards the east.) They said there had grown 
<A NAME="466"></A>up among them some wild young men, the sons of certain chiefs, who, when 
<A NAME="467"></A>they came to man's estate, indulged in all manner of extravagancies, and 
<A NAME="468"></A>among other things drew lots for five of their number to go and explore 
<A NAME="469"></A>the desert parts of Libya, and try if they could not penetrate further 
<A NAME="470"></A>than any had done previously. The coast of Libya along the sea which washes 
<A NAME="471"></A>it to the north, throughout its entire length from Egypt to Cape Soloeis, 
<A NAME="472"></A>which is its furthest point, is inhabited by Libyans of many distinct tribes 
<A NAME="473"></A>who possess the whole tract except certain portions which belong to the 
<A NAME="474"></A>Phoenicians and the Greeks. Above the coast-line and the country inhabited 
<A NAME="475"></A>by the maritime tribes, Libya is full of wild beasts; while beyond the 
<A NAME="476"></A>wild beast region there is a tract which is wholly sand, very scant of 
<A NAME="477"></A>water, and utterly and entirely a desert. The young men therefore, despatched 
<A NAME="478"></A>on this errand by their comrades with a plentiful supply of water and provisions, 
<A NAME="479"></A>travelled at first through the inhabited region, passing which they came 
<A NAME="480"></A>to the wild beast tract, whence they finally entered upon the desert, which 
<A NAME="481"></A>they proceeded to cross in a direction from east to west. After journeying 
<A NAME="482"></A>for many days over a wide extent of sand, they came at last to a plain 
<A NAME="483"></A>where they observed trees growing; approaching them, and seeing fruit on 
<A NAME="484"></A>them, they proceeded to gather it. While they were thus engaged, there 
<A NAME="485"></A>came upon them some dwarfish men, under the middle height, who seized them 
<A NAME="486"></A>and carried them off. The Nasamonians could not understand a word of their 
<A NAME="487"></A>language, nor had they any acquaintance with the language of the Nasamonians. 
<A NAME="488"></A>They were led across extensive marshes, and finally came to a town, where 
<A NAME="489"></A>all the men were of the height of their conductors, and black-complexioned. 
<A NAME="490"></A>A great river flowed by the town, running from west to east, and containing 
<A NAME="491"></A>crocodiles.
<A NAME="492"></A><BR><BR>Here let me dismiss Etearchus the Ammonian, and his story, only 
<A NAME="493"></A>adding that (according to the Cyrenaeans) he declared that the Nasamonians 
<A NAME="494"></A>got safe back to their country, and that the men whose city they had reached 
<A NAME="495"></A>were a nation of sorcerers. With respect to the river which ran by their 
<A NAME="496"></A>town, Etearchus conjectured it to be the Nile; and reason favours that 
<A NAME="497"></A>view. For the Nile certainly flows out of Libya, dividing it down the middle, 
<A NAME="498"></A>and as I conceive, judging the unknown from the known, rises at the same 
<A NAME="499"></A>distance from its mouth as the Ister. This latter river has its source 
<A NAME="500"></A>in the country of the Celts near the city Pyrene, and runs through the 
<A NAME="501"></A>middle of Europe, dividing it into two portions. The Celts live beyond 
<A NAME="502"></A>the pillars of Hercules, and border on the Cynesians, who dwell at the 
<A NAME="503"></A>extreme west of Europe. Thus the Ister flows through the whole of Europe 
<A NAME="504"></A>before it finally empties itself into the Euxine at Istria, one of the 
<A NAME="505"></A>colonies of the Milesians.
<A NAME="506"></A><BR><BR>Now as this river flows through regions that are inhabited, its 
<A NAME="507"></A>course is perfectly well known; but of the sources of the Nile no one can 
<A NAME="508"></A>give any account, since Libya, the country through which it passes, is 
<A NAME="509"></A>desert and without inhabitants. As far as it was possible to get information 
<A NAME="510"></A>by inquiry, I have given a description of the stream. It enters Egypt from 
<A NAME="511"></A>the parts beyond. Egypt lies almost exactly opposite the mountainous portion 
<A NAME="512"></A>of Cilicia, whence a lightly-equipped traveller may reach Sinope on the 
<A NAME="513"></A>Euxine in five days by the direct route. Sinope lies opposite the place 
<A NAME="514"></A>where the Ister falls into the sea. My opinion therefore is that the Nile, 
<A NAME="515"></A>as it traverses the whole of Libya, is of equal length with the Ister. 
<A NAME="516"></A>And here I take my leave of this subject.
<A NAME="517"></A><BR><BR>Concerning Egypt itself I shall extend my remarks to a great length, 
<A NAME="518"></A>because there is no country that possesses so many wonders, nor any that 
<A NAME="519"></A>has such a number of works which defy description. Not only is the climate 
<A NAME="520"></A>different from that of the rest of the world, and the rivers unlike any 
<A NAME="521"></A>other rivers, but the people also, in most of their manners and customs, 
<A NAME="522"></A>exactly reverse the common practice of mankind. The women attend the markets 
<A NAME="523"></A>and trade, while the men sit at home at the loom; and here, while the rest 
<A NAME="524"></A>of the world works the woof up the warp, the Egyptians work it down; the 
<A NAME="525"></A>women likewise carry burthens upon their shoulders, while the men carry 
<A NAME="526"></A>them upon their heads. They eat their food out of doors in the streets, 
<A NAME="527"></A>but retire for private purposes to their houses, giving as a reason that 
<A NAME="528"></A>what is unseemly, but necessary, ought to be done in secret, but what has 
<A NAME="529"></A>nothing unseemly about it, should be done openly. A woman cannot serve 
<A NAME="530"></A>the priestly office, either for god or goddess, but men are priests to 
<A NAME="531"></A>both; sons need not support their parents unless they choose, but daughters 
<A NAME="532"></A>must, whether they choose or no.
<A NAME="533"></A><BR><BR>In other countries the priests have long hair, in Egypt their heads 
<A NAME="534"></A>are shaven; elsewhere it is customary, in mourning, for near relations 
<A NAME="535"></A>to cut their hair close: the Egyptians, who wear no hair at any other time, 
<A NAME="536"></A>when they lose a relative, let their beards and the hair of their heads 
<A NAME="537"></A>grow long. All other men pass their lives separate from animals, the Egyptians 
<A NAME="538"></A>have animals always living with them; others make barley and wheat their 
<A NAME="539"></A>food; it is a disgrace to do so in Egypt, where the grain they live on 
<A NAME="540"></A>is spelt, which some call zea. Dough they knead with their feet; but they 
<A NAME="541"></A>mix mud, and even take up dirt, with their hands. They are the only people 
<A NAME="542"></A>in the world- they at least, and such as have learnt the practice from 
<A NAME="543"></A>them- who use circumcision. Their men wear two garments apiece, their women 
<A NAME="544"></A>but one. They put on the rings and fasten the ropes to sails inside; others 
<A NAME="545"></A>put them outside. When they write or calculate, instead of going, like 
<A NAME="546"></A>the Greeks, from left to right, they move their hand from right to left; 
<A NAME="547"></A>and they insist, notwithstanding, that it is they who go to the right, 
<A NAME="548"></A>and the Greeks who go to the left. They have two quite different kinds 
<A NAME="549"></A>of writing, one of which is called sacred, the other 
<A NAME="550"></A>common.
<A NAME="551"></A><BR><BR>They are religious to excess, far beyond any other race of men, 
<A NAME="552"></A>and use the following ceremonies:- They drink out of brazen cups, which 
<A NAME="553"></A>they scour every day: there is no exception to this practice. They wear 
<A NAME="554"></A>linen garments, which they are specially careful to have always fresh washed. 
<A NAME="555"></A>They practise circumcision for the sake of cleanliness, considering it 
<A NAME="556"></A>better to be cleanly than comely. The priests shave their whole body every 
<A NAME="557"></A>other day, that no lice or other impure thing may adhere to them when they 
<A NAME="558"></A>are engaged in the service of the gods. Their dress is entirely of linen, 
<A NAME="559"></A>and their shoes of the papyrus plant: it is not lawful for them to wear 
<A NAME="560"></A>either dress or shoes of any other material. They bathe twice every day 
<A NAME="561"></A>in cold water, and twice each night; besides which they observe, so to 
<A NAME="562"></A>speak, thousands of ceremonies. They enjoy, however, not a few advantages. 
<A NAME="563"></A>They consume none of their own property, and are at no expense for anything; 
<A NAME="564"></A>but every day bread is baked for them of the sacred corn, and a plentiful 
<A NAME="565"></A>supply of beef and of goose's flesh is assigned to each, and also a portion 
<A NAME="566"></A>of wine made from the grape. Fish they are not allowed to eat; and beans- 
<A NAME="567"></A>which none of the Egyptians ever sow, or eat, if they come up of their 
<A NAME="568"></A>own accord, either raw or boiled- the priests will not even endure to look 
<A NAME="569"></A>on, since they consider it an unclean kind of pulse. Instead of a single 
<A NAME="570"></A>priest, each god has the attendance of a college, at the head of which 
<A NAME="571"></A>is a chief priest; when one of these dies, his son is appointed in his 
<A NAME="572"></A>room.
<A NAME="573"></A><BR><BR>Male kine are reckoned to belong to Epaphus, and are therefore 
<A NAME="574"></A>tested in the following manner:- One of the priests appointed for the purpose 
<A NAME="575"></A>searches to see if there is a single black hair on the whole body, since 
<A NAME="576"></A>in that case the beast is unclean. He examines him all over, standing on 
<A NAME="577"></A>his legs, and again laid upon his back; after which he takes the tongue 
<A NAME="578"></A>out of his mouth, to see if it be clean in respect of the prescribed marks 
<A NAME="579"></A>(what they are I will mention elsewhere); he also inspects the hairs of 
<A NAME="580"></A>the tail, to observe if they grow naturally. If the animal is pronounced 
<A NAME="581"></A>clean in all these various points, the priest marks him by twisting a piece 
<A NAME="582"></A>of papyrus round his horns, and attaching thereto some sealing-clay, which 
<A NAME="583"></A>he then stamps with his own signet-ring. After this the beast is led away; 
<A NAME="584"></A>and it is forbidden, under the penalty of death, to sacrifice an animal 
<A NAME="585"></A>which has not been marked in this way.
<A NAME="586"></A><BR><BR>The following is their manner of sacrifice:- They lead the victim, 
<A NAME="587"></A>marked with their signet, to the altar where they are about to offer it, 
<A NAME="588"></A>and setting the wood alight, pour a libation of wine upon the altar in 
<A NAME="589"></A>front of the victim, and at the same time invoke the god. Then they slay 
<A NAME="590"></A>the animal, and cutting off his head, proceed to flay the body. Next they 
<A NAME="591"></A>take the head, and heaping imprecations on it, if there is a market-place 
<A NAME="592"></A>and a body of Greek traders in the city, they carry it there and sell it 
<A NAME="593"></A>instantly; if, however, there are no Greeks among them, they throw the 
<A NAME="594"></A>head into the river. The imprecation is to this effect:- They pray that 
<A NAME="595"></A>if any evil is impending either over those who sacrifice, or over universal 
<A NAME="596"></A>Egypt, it may be made to fall upon that head. These practices, the imprecations 
<A NAME="597"></A>upon the heads, and the libations of wine, prevail all over Egypt, and 
<A NAME="598"></A>extend to victims of all sorts; and hence the Egyptians will never eat 
<A NAME="599"></A>the head of any animal.
<A NAME="600"></A><BR><BR>The disembowelling and burning are, however, different in different 
<A NAME="601"></A>sacrifices. I will mention the mode in use with respect to the goddess 
<A NAME="602"></A>whom they regard as the greatest, and honour with the chiefest festival. 
<A NAME="603"></A>When they have flayed their steer they pray, and when their prayer is ended 
<A NAME="604"></A>they take the paunch of the animal out entire, leaving the intestines and 
<A NAME="605"></A>the fat inside the body; they then cut off the legs, the ends of the loins, 
<A NAME="606"></A>the shoulders, and the neck; and having so done, they fill the body of 
<A NAME="607"></A>the steer with clean bread, honey, raisins, figs, frankincense, myrrh, 
<A NAME="608"></A>and other aromatics. Thus filled, they burn the body, pouring over it great 
<A NAME="609"></A>quantities of oil. Before offering the sacrifice they fast, and while the 
<A NAME="610"></A>bodies of the victims are being consumed they beat themselves. Afterwards, 
<A NAME="611"></A>when they have concluded this part of the ceremony, they have the other 
<A NAME="612"></A>parts of the victim served up to them for a repast.
<A NAME="613"></A><BR><BR>The male kine, therefore, if clean, and the male calves, are used 
<A NAME="614"></A>for sacrifice by the Egyptians universally; but the females they are not 
<A NAME="615"></A>allowed to sacrifice, since they are sacred to Isis. The statue of this 
<A NAME="616"></A>goddess has the form of a woman but with horns like a cow, resembling thus 
<A NAME="617"></A>the Greek representations of Io; and the Egyptians, one and all, venerate 
<A NAME="618"></A>cows much more highly than any other animal. This is the reason why no 
<A NAME="619"></A>native of Egypt, whether man or woman, will give a Greek a kiss, or use 
<A NAME="620"></A>the knife of a Greek, or his spit, or his cauldron, or taste the flesh 
<A NAME="621"></A>of an ox, known to be pure, if it has been cut with a Greek knife. When 
<A NAME="622"></A>kine die, the following is the manner of their sepulture:- The females 
<A NAME="623"></A>are thrown into the river; the males are buried in the suburbs of the towns, 
<A NAME="624"></A>with one or both of their horns appearing above the surface of the ground 
<A NAME="625"></A>to mark the place. When the bodies are decayed, a boat comes, at an appointed 
<A NAME="626"></A>time, from the island called Prosopitis,- which is a portion of the Delta, 
<A NAME="627"></A>nine schoenes in circumference,- and calls at the several cities in turn 
<A NAME="628"></A>to collect the bones of the oxen. Prosopitis is a district containing several 
<A NAME="629"></A>cities; the name of that from which the boats come is Atarbechis. Venus 
<A NAME="630"></A>has a temple there of much sanctity. Great numbers of men go forth from 
<A NAME="631"></A>this city and proceed to the other towns, where they dig up the bones, 
<A NAME="632"></A>which they take away with them and bury together in one place. The same 
<A NAME="633"></A>practice prevails with respect to the interment of all other cattle- the 
<A NAME="634"></A>law so determining; they do not slaughter any of them.
<A NAME="635"></A><BR><BR>Such Egyptians as possess a temple of the Theban Jove, or live 
<A NAME="636"></A>in the Thebaic canton, offer no sheep in sacrifice, but only goats; for 
<A NAME="637"></A>the Egyptians do not all worship the same gods, excepting Isis and Osiris, 
<A NAME="638"></A>the latter of whom they say is the Grecian Bacchus. Those, on the contrary, 
<A NAME="639"></A>who possess a temple dedicated to Mendes, or belong to the Mendesian canton, 
<A NAME="640"></A>abstain from offering goats, and sacrifice sheep instead. The Thebans, 
<A NAME="641"></A>and such as imitate them in their practice, give the following account 
<A NAME="642"></A>of the origin of the custom:- "Hercules," they say, "wished of all things 
<A NAME="643"></A>to see Jove, but Jove did not choose to be seen of him. At length, when 
<A NAME="644"></A>Hercules persisted, Jove hit on a device- to flay a ram, and, cutting off 
<A NAME="645"></A>his head, hold the head before him, and cover himself with the fleece. 
<A NAME="646"></A>In this guise he showed himself to Hercules." Therefore the Egyptians give 
<A NAME="647"></A>their statues of Jupiter the face of a ram: and from them the practice 
<A NAME="648"></A>has passed to the Ammonians, who are a joint colony of Egyptians and Ethiopians, 
<A NAME="649"></A>speaking a language between the two; hence also, in my opinion, the latter 
<A NAME="650"></A>people took their name of Ammonians, since the Egyptian name for Jupiter 
<A NAME="651"></A>is Amun. Such, then, is the reason why the Thebans do not sacrifice rams, 
<A NAME="652"></A>but consider them sacred animals. Upon one day in the year, however, at 
<A NAME="653"></A>the festival of Jupiter, they slay a single ram, and stripping off the 
<A NAME="654"></A>fleece, cover with it the statue of that god, as he once covered himself, 
<A NAME="655"></A>and then bring up to the statue of Jove an image of Hercules. When this 
<A NAME="656"></A>has been done, the whole assembly beat their breasts in mourning for the 
<A NAME="657"></A>ram, and afterwards bury him in a holy sepulchre.
<A NAME="658"></A><BR><BR>The account which I received of this Hercules makes him one of 
<A NAME="659"></A>the twelve gods. Of the other Hercules, with whom the Greeks are familiar, 
<A NAME="660"></A>I could hear nothing in any part of Egypt. That the Greeks, however (those 
<A NAME="661"></A>I mean who gave the son of Amphitryon that name), took the name from the 
<A NAME="662"></A>Egyptians, and not the Egyptians from the Greeks, is I think clearly proved, 
<A NAME="663"></A>among other arguments, by the fact that both the parents of Hercules, Amphitryon 
<A NAME="664"></A>as well as Alcmena, were of Egyptian origin. Again, the Egyptians disclaim 
<A NAME="665"></A>all knowledge of the names of Neptune and the Dioscuri, and do not include 
<A NAME="666"></A>them in the number of their gods; but had they adopted the name of any 
<A NAME="667"></A>god from the Greeks, these would have been the likeliest to obtain notice, 
<A NAME="668"></A>since the Egyptians, as I am well convinced, practised navigation at that 
<A NAME="669"></A>time, and the Greeks also were some of them mariners, so that they would 
<A NAME="670"></A>have been more likely to know the names of these gods than that of Hercules. 
<A NAME="671"></A>But the Egyptian Hercules is one of their ancient gods. Seventeen thousand 
<A NAME="672"></A>years before the reign of Amasis, the twelve gods were, they affirm, produced 
<A NAME="673"></A>from the eight: and of these twelve, Hercules is one.
<A NAME="674"></A><BR><BR>In the wish to get the best information that I could on these matters, 
<A NAME="675"></A>I made a voyage to Tyre in Phoenicia, hearing there was a temple of Hercules 
<A NAME="676"></A>at that place, very highly venerated. I visited the temple, and found it 
<A NAME="677"></A>richly adorned with a number of offerings, among which were two pillars, 
<A NAME="678"></A>one of pure gold, the other of emerald, shining with great brilliancy at 
<A NAME="679"></A>night. In a conversation which I held with the priests, I inquired how 
<A NAME="680"></A>long their temple had been built, and found by their answer that they, 
<A NAME="681"></A>too, differed from the Greeks. They said that the temple was built at the 
<A NAME="682"></A>same time that the city was founded, and that the foundation of the city 
<A NAME="683"></A>took place two thousand three hundred years ago. In Tyre I remarked another 
<A NAME="684"></A>temple where the same god was worshipped as the Thasian Hercules. So I 
<A NAME="685"></A>went on to Thasos, where I found a temple of Hercules which had been built 
<A NAME="686"></A>by the Phoenicians who colonised that island when they sailed in search 
<A NAME="687"></A>of Europa. Even this was five generations earlier than the time when Hercules, 
<A NAME="688"></A>son of Amphitryon, was born in Greece. These researches show plainly that 
<A NAME="689"></A>there is an ancient god Hercules; and my own opinion is that those Greeks 
<A NAME="690"></A>act most wisely who build and maintain two temples of Hercules, in the 
<A NAME="691"></A>one of which the Hercules worshipped is known by the name of Olympian, 
<A NAME="692"></A>and has sacrifice offered to him as an immortal, while in the other the 
<A NAME="693"></A>honours paid are such as are due to a hero.
<A NAME="694"></A><BR><BR>The Greeks tell many tales without due investigation, and among 
<A NAME="695"></A>them the following silly fable respecting Hercules:- "Hercules," they say, 
<A NAME="696"></A>"went once to Egypt, and there the inhabitants took him, and putting a 
<A NAME="697"></A>chaplet on his head, led him out in solemn procession, intending to offer 
<A NAME="698"></A>him a sacrifice to Jupiter. For a while he submitted quietly; but when 
<A NAME="699"></A>they led him up to the altar and began the ceremonies, he put forth his 
<A NAME="700"></A>strength and slew them all." Now to me it seems that such a story proves 
<A NAME="701"></A>the Greeks to be utterly ignorant of the character and customs of the people. 
<A NAME="702"></A>The Egyptians do not think it allowable even to sacrifice cattle, excepting 
<A NAME="703"></A>sheep, and the male kine and calves, provided they be pure, and also geese. 
<A NAME="704"></A>How, then, can it be believed that they would sacrifice men? And again, 
<A NAME="705"></A>how would it have been possible for Hercules alone, and, as they confess, 
<A NAME="706"></A>a mere mortal, to destroy so many thousands? In saying thus much concerning 
<A NAME="707"></A>these matters, may I incur no displeasure either of god or 
<A NAME="708"></A>hero!
<A NAME="709"></A><BR><BR>I mentioned above that some of the Egyptians abstain from sacrificing 
<A NAME="710"></A>goats, either male or female. The reason is the following:- These Egyptians, 
<A NAME="711"></A>who are the Mendesians, consider Pan to be one of the eight gods who existed 
<A NAME="712"></A>before the twelve, and Pan is represented in Egypt by the painters and 
<A NAME="713"></A>the sculptors, just as he is in Greece, with the face and legs of a goat. 
<A NAME="714"></A>They do not, however, believe this to be his shape, or consider him in 
<A NAME="715"></A>any respect unlike the other gods; but they represent him thus for a reason 
<A NAME="716"></A>which I prefer not to relate. The Mendesians hold all goats in veneration, 
<A NAME="717"></A>but the male more than the female, giving the goatherds of the males especial 
<A NAME="718"></A>honour. One is venerated more highly than all the rest, and when he dies 
<A NAME="719"></A>there is a great mourning throughout all the Mendesian canton. In Egyptian, 
<A NAME="720"></A>the goat and Pan are both called Mendes.
<A NAME="721"></A><BR><BR>The pig is regarded among them as an unclean animal, so much so 
<A NAME="722"></A>that if a man in passing accidentally touch a pig, he instantly hurries 
<A NAME="723"></A>to the river, and plunges in with all his clothes on. Hence, too, the swineherds, 
<A NAME="724"></A>notwithstanding that they are of pure Egyptian blood, are forbidden to 
<A NAME="725"></A>enter into any of the temples, which are open to all other Egyptians; and 
<A NAME="726"></A>further, no one will give his daughter in marriage to a swineherd, or take 
<A NAME="727"></A>a wife from among them, so that the swineherds are forced to intermarry 
<A NAME="728"></A>among themselves. They do not offer swine in sacrifice to any of their 
<A NAME="729"></A>gods, excepting Bacchus and the Moon, whom they honour in this way at the 
<A NAME="730"></A>same time, sacrificing pigs to both of them at the same full moon, and 
<A NAME="731"></A>afterwards eating of the flesh. There is a reason alleged by them for their 
<A NAME="732"></A>detestation of swine at all other seasons, and their use of them at this 
<A NAME="733"></A>festival, with which I am well acquainted, but which I do not think it 
<A NAME="734"></A>proper to mention. The following is the mode in which they sacrifice the 
<A NAME="735"></A>swine to the Moon:- As soon as the victim is slain, the tip of the tail, 
<A NAME="736"></A>the spleen, and the caul are put together, and having been covered with 
<A NAME="737"></A>all the fat that has been found in the animal's belly, are straightway 
<A NAME="738"></A>burnt. The remainder of the flesh is eaten on the same day that the sacrifice 
<A NAME="739"></A>is offered, which is the day of the full moon: at any other time they would 
<A NAME="740"></A>not so much as taste it. The poorer sort, who cannot afford live pigs, 
<A NAME="741"></A>form pigs of dough, which they bake and offer in sacrifice.
<A NAME="742"></A><BR><BR>To Bacchus, on the eve of his feast, every Egyptian sacrifices 
<A NAME="743"></A>a hog before the door of his house, which is then given back to the swineherd 
<A NAME="744"></A>by whom it was furnished, and by him carried away. In other respects the 
<A NAME="745"></A>festival is celebrated almost exactly as Bacchic festivals are in Greece, 
<A NAME="746"></A>excepting that the Egyptians have no choral dances. They also use instead 
<A NAME="747"></A>of phalli another invention, consisting of images a cubit high, pulled 
<A NAME="748"></A>by strings, which the women carry round to the villages. A piper goes in 
<A NAME="749"></A>front, and the women follow, singing hymns in honour of Bacchus. They give 
<A NAME="750"></A>a religious reason for the peculiarities of the image.
<A NAME="751"></A><BR><BR>Melampus, the son of Amytheon, cannot (I think) have been ignorant 
<A NAME="752"></A>of this ceremony- nay, he must, I should conceive, have been well acquainted 
<A NAME="753"></A>with it. He it was who introduced into Greece the name of Bacchus, the 
<A NAME="754"></A>ceremonial of his worship, and the procession of the phallus. He did not, 
<A NAME="755"></A>however, so completely apprehend the whole doctrine as to be able to communicate 
<A NAME="756"></A>it entirely, but various sages since his time have carried out his teaching 
<A NAME="757"></A>to greater perfection. Still it is certain that Melampus introduced the 
<A NAME="758"></A>phallus, and that the Greeks learnt from him the ceremonies which they 
<A NAME="759"></A>now practise. I therefore maintain that Melampus, who was a wise man, and 
<A NAME="760"></A>had acquired the art of divination, having become acquainted with the worship 
<A NAME="761"></A>of Bacchus through knowledge derived from Egypt, introduced it into Greece, 
<A NAME="762"></A>with a few slight changes, at the same time that he brought in various 
<A NAME="763"></A>other practices. For I can by no means allow that it is by mere coincidence 
<A NAME="764"></A>that the Bacchic ceremonies in Greece are so nearly the same as the Egyptian- 
<A NAME="765"></A>they would then have been more Greek in their character, and less recent 
<A NAME="766"></A>in their origin. Much less can I admit that the Egyptians borrowed these 
<A NAME="767"></A>customs, or any other, from the Greeks. My belief is that Melampus got 
<A NAME="768"></A>his knowledge of them from Cadmus the Tyrian, and the followers whom he 
<A NAME="769"></A>brought from Phoenicia into the country which is now called 
<A NAME="770"></A>Boeotia.
<A NAME="771"></A><BR><BR>Almost all the names of the gods came into Greece from Egypt. My 
<A NAME="772"></A>inquiries prove that they were all derived from a foreign source, and my 
<A NAME="773"></A>opinion is that Egypt furnished the greater number. For with the exception 
<A NAME="774"></A>of Neptune and the Dioscuri, whom I mentioned above, and Juno, Vesta, Themis, 
<A NAME="775"></A>the Graces, and the Nereids, the other gods have been known from time immemorial 
<A NAME="776"></A>in Egypt. This I assert on the authority of the Egyptians themselves. The 
<A NAME="777"></A>gods, with whose names they profess themselves unacquainted, the Greeks 
<A NAME="778"></A>received, I believe, from the Pelasgi, except Neptune. Of him they got 
<A NAME="779"></A>their knowledge from the Libyans, by whom he has been always honoured, 
<A NAME="780"></A>and who were anciently the only people that had a god of the name. The 
<A NAME="781"></A>Egyptians differ from the Greeks also in paying no divine honours to 
<A NAME="782"></A>heroes.
<A NAME="783"></A><BR><BR>Besides these which have been here mentioned, there are many other 
<A NAME="784"></A>practices whereof I shall speak hereafter, which the Greeks have borrowed 
<A NAME="785"></A>from Egypt. The peculiarity, however, which they observe in their statues 
<A NAME="786"></A>of Mercury they did not derive from the Egyptians, but from the Pelasgi; 
<A NAME="787"></A>from them the Athenians first adopted it, and afterwards it passed from 
<A NAME="788"></A>the Athenians to the other Greeks. For just at the time when the Athenians 
<A NAME="789"></A>were entering into the Hellenic body, the Pelasgi came to live with them 
<A NAME="790"></A>in their country, whence it was that the latter came first to be regarded 
<A NAME="791"></A>as Greeks. Whoever has been initiated into the mysteries of the Cabiri 
<A NAME="792"></A>will understand what I mean. The Samothracians received these mysteries 
<A NAME="793"></A>from the Pelasgi, who, before they went to live in Attica, were dwellers 
<A NAME="794"></A>in Samothrace, and imparted their religious ceremonies to the inhabitants. 
<A NAME="795"></A>The Athenians, then, who were the first of all the Greeks to make their 
<A NAME="796"></A>statues of Mercury in this way, learnt the practice from the Pelasgians; 
<A NAME="797"></A>and by this people a religious account of the matter is given, which is 
<A NAME="798"></A>explained in the Samothracian mysteries.
<A NAME="799"></A><BR><BR>In early times the Pelasgi, as I know by information which I got 
<A NAME="800"></A>at Dodona, offered sacrifices of all kinds, and prayed to the gods, but 
<A NAME="801"></A>had no distinct names or appellations for them, since they had never heard 
<A NAME="802"></A>of any. They called them gods (Theoi, disposers), because they disposed 
<A NAME="803"></A>and arranged all things in such a beautiful order. After a long lapse of 
<A NAME="804"></A>time the names of the gods came to Greece from Egypt, and the Pelasgi learnt 
<A NAME="805"></A>them, only as yet they knew nothing of Bacchus, of whom they first heard 
<A NAME="806"></A>at a much later date. Not long after the arrival of the names they sent 
<A NAME="807"></A>to consult the oracle at Dodona about them. This is the most ancient oracle 
<A NAME="808"></A>in Greece, and at that time there was no other. To their question, "Whether 
<A NAME="809"></A>they should adopt the names that had been imported from the foreigners?" 
<A NAME="810"></A>the oracle replied by recommending their use. Thenceforth in their sacrifices 
<A NAME="811"></A>the Pelasgi made use of the names of the gods, and from them the names 
<A NAME="812"></A>passed afterwards to the Greeks.
<A NAME="813"></A><BR><BR>Whence the gods severally sprang, whether or no they had all existed 
<A NAME="814"></A>from eternity, what forms they bore- these are questions of which the Greeks 
<A NAME="815"></A>knew nothing until the other day, so to speak. For Homer and Hesiod were 
<A NAME="816"></A>the first to compose Theogonies, and give the gods their epithets, to allot 
<A NAME="817"></A>them their several offices and occupations, and describe their forms; and 
<A NAME="818"></A>they lived but four hundred years before my time, as I believe. As for 
<A NAME="819"></A>the poets who are thought by some to be earlier than these, they are, in 
<A NAME="820"></A>my judgment, decidedly later writers. In these matters I have the authority 
<A NAME="821"></A>of the priestesses of Dodona for the former portion of my statements; what 
<A NAME="822"></A>I have said of Homer and Hesiod is my own opinion.
<A NAME="823"></A><BR><BR>The following tale is commonly told in Egypt concerning the oracle 
<A NAME="824"></A>of Dodona in Greece, and that of Ammon in Libya. My informants on the point 
<A NAME="825"></A>were the priests of Jupiter at Thebes. They said "that two of the sacred 
<A NAME="826"></A>women were once carried off from Thebes by the Phoenicians, and that the 
<A NAME="827"></A>story went that one of them was sold into Libya, and the other into Greece, 
<A NAME="828"></A>and these women were the first founders of the oracles in the two countries." 
<A NAME="829"></A>On my inquiring how they came to know so exactly what became of the women, 
<A NAME="830"></A>they answered, "that diligent search had been made after them at the time, 
<A NAME="831"></A>but that it had not been found possible to discover where they were; afterwards, 
<A NAME="832"></A>however, they received the information which they had given 
<A NAME="833"></A>me."
<A NAME="834"></A><BR><BR>This was what I heard from the priests at Thebes; at Dodona, however, 
<A NAME="835"></A>the women who deliver the oracles relate the matter as follows:- "Two black 
<A NAME="836"></A>doves flew away from Egyptian Thebes, and while one directed its flight 
<A NAME="837"></A>to Libya, the other came to them. She alighted on an oak, and sitting there 
<A NAME="838"></A>began to speak with a human voice, and told them that on the spot where 
<A NAME="839"></A>she was, there should henceforth be an oracle of Jove. They understood 
<A NAME="840"></A>the announcement to be from heaven, so they set to work at once and erected 
<A NAME="841"></A>the shrine. The dove which flew to Libya bade the Libyans to establish 
<A NAME="842"></A>there the oracle of Ammon." This likewise is an oracle of Jupiter. The 
<A NAME="843"></A>persons from whom I received these particulars were three priestesses of 
<A NAME="844"></A>the Dodonaeans, the eldest Promeneia, the next Timarete, and the youngest 
<A NAME="845"></A>Nicandra- what they said was confirmed by the other Dodonaeans who dwell 
<A NAME="846"></A>around the temple.
<A NAME="847"></A><BR><BR>My own opinion of these matters is as follows:- I think that, if 
<A NAME="848"></A>it be true that the Phoenicians carried off the holy women, and sold them 
<A NAME="849"></A>for slaves, the one into Libya and the other into Greece, or Pelasgia (as 
<A NAME="850"></A>it was then called), this last must have been sold to the Thesprotians. 
<A NAME="851"></A>Afterwards, while undergoing servitude in those parts, she built under 
<A NAME="852"></A>a real oak a temple to Jupiter, her thoughts in her new abode reverting- 
<A NAME="853"></A>as it was likely they would do, if she had been an attendant in a temple 
<A NAME="854"></A>of Jupiter at Thebes- to that particular god. Then, having acquired a knowledge 
<A NAME="855"></A>of the Greek tongue, she set up an oracle. She also mentioned that her 
<A NAME="856"></A>sister had been sold for a slave into Libya by the same persons as 
<A NAME="857"></A>herself.
<A NAME="858"></A><BR><BR>The Dodonaeans called the women doves because they were foreigners, 
<A NAME="859"></A>and seemed to them to make a noise like birds. After a while the dove spoke 
<A NAME="860"></A>with a human voice, because the woman, whose foreign talk had previously 
<A NAME="861"></A>sounded to them like the chattering of a bird, acquired the power of speaking 
<A NAME="862"></A>what they could understand. For how can it be conceived possible that a 
<A NAME="863"></A>dove should really speak with the voice of a man? Lastly, by calling the 
<A NAME="864"></A>dove black the Dodonaeans indicated that the woman was an Egyptian. And 
<A NAME="865"></A>certainly the character of the oracles at Thebes and Dodona is very similar. 
<A NAME="866"></A>Besides this form of divination, the Greeks learnt also divination by means 
<A NAME="867"></A>of victims from the Egyptians.
<A NAME="868"></A><BR><BR>The Egyptians were also the first to introduce solemn assemblies, 
<A NAME="869"></A>processions, and litanies to the gods; of all which the Greeks were taught 
<A NAME="870"></A>the use by them. It seems to me a sufficient proof of this that in Egypt 
<A NAME="871"></A>these practices have been established from remote antiquity, while in Greece 
<A NAME="872"></A>they are only recently known.
<A NAME="873"></A><BR><BR>The Egyptians do not hold a single solemn assembly, but several 
<A NAME="874"></A>in the course of the year. Of these the chief, which is better attended 
<A NAME="875"></A>than any other, is held at the city of Bubastis in honour of Diana. The 
<A NAME="876"></A>next in importance is that which takes place at Busiris, a city situated 
<A NAME="877"></A>in the very middle of the Delta; it is in honour of Isis, who is called 
<A NAME="878"></A>in the Greek tongue Demiter (Ceres). There is a third great festival in 
<A NAME="879"></A>Sais to Minerva, a fourth in Heliopolis to the Sun, a fifth in Buto to 
<A NAME="880"></A>Latona, and a sixth in Papremis to Mars.
<A NAME="881"></A><BR><BR>The following are the proceedings on occasion of the assembly at 
<A NAME="882"></A>Bubastis:- Men and women come sailing all together, vast numbers in each 
<A NAME="883"></A>boat, many of the women with castanets, which they strike, while some of 
<A NAME="884"></A>the men pipe during the whole time of the voyage; the remainder of the 
<A NAME="885"></A>voyagers, male and female, sing the while, and make a clapping with their 
<A NAME="886"></A>hands. When they arrive opposite any of the towns upon the banks of the 
<A NAME="887"></A>stream, they approach the shore, and, while some of the women continue 
<A NAME="888"></A>to play and sing, others call aloud to the females of the place and load 
<A NAME="889"></A>them with abuse, while a certain number dance, and some standing up uncover 
<A NAME="890"></A>themselves. After proceeding in this way all along the river-course, they 
<A NAME="891"></A>reach Bubastis, where they celebrate the feast with abundant sacrifices. 
<A NAME="892"></A>More grape-wine is consumed at this festival than in all the rest of the 
<A NAME="893"></A>year besides. The number of those who attend, counting only the men and 
<A NAME="894"></A>women and omitting the children, amounts, according to the native reports, 
<A NAME="895"></A>to seven hundred thousand.
<A NAME="896"></A><BR><BR>The ceremonies at the feast of Isis in the city of Busiris have 
<A NAME="897"></A>been already spoken of. It is there that the whole multitude, both of men 
<A NAME="898"></A>and women, many thousands in number, beat themselves at the close of the 
<A NAME="899"></A>sacrifice, in honour of a god, whose name a religious scruple forbids me 
<A NAME="900"></A>to mention. The Carian dwellers in Egypt proceed on this occasion to still 
<A NAME="901"></A>greater lengths, even cutting their faces with their knives, whereby they 
<A NAME="902"></A>let it been seen that they are not Egyptians but foreigners.
<A NAME="903"></A><BR><BR>At Sais, when the assembly takes place for the sacrifices, there 
<A NAME="904"></A>is one night on which the inhabitants all burn a multitude of lights in 
<A NAME="905"></A>the open air round their houses. They use lamps in the shape of flat saucers 
<A NAME="906"></A>filled with a mixture of oil and salt, on the top of which the wick floats. 
<A NAME="907"></A>These burn the whole night, and give to the festival the name of the Feast 
<A NAME="908"></A>of Lamps. The Egyptians who are absent from the festival observe the night 
<A NAME="909"></A>of the sacrifice, no less than the rest, by a general lighting of lamps; 
<A NAME="910"></A>so that the illumination is not confined to the city of Sais, but extends 
<A NAME="911"></A>over the whole of Egypt. And there is a religious reason assigned for the 
<A NAME="912"></A>special honour paid to this night, as well as for the illumination which 
<A NAME="913"></A>accompanies it.
<A NAME="914"></A><BR><BR>At Heliopolis and Buto the assemblies are merely for the purpose 
<A NAME="915"></A>of sacrifice; but at Papremis, besides the sacrifices and other rites which 
<A NAME="916"></A>are performed there as elsewhere, the following custom is observed:- When 
<A NAME="917"></A>the sun is getting low, a few only of the priests continue occupied about 
<A NAME="918"></A>the image of the god, while the greater number, armed with wooden clubs, 
<A NAME="919"></A>take their station at the portal of the temple. Opposite to them is drawn 
<A NAME="920"></A>up a body of men, in number above a thousand, armed, like the others, with 
<A NAME="921"></A>clubs, consisting of persons engaged in the performance of their vows. 
<A NAME="922"></A>The image of the god, which is kept in a small wooden shrine covered with 
<A NAME="923"></A>plates of gold, is conveyed from the temple into a second sacred building 
<A NAME="924"></A>the day before the festival begins. The few priests still in attendance 
<A NAME="925"></A>upon the image place it, together with the shrine containing it, on a four-wheeled 
<A NAME="926"></A>car, and begin to drag it along; the others stationed at the gateway of 
<A NAME="927"></A>the temple, oppose its admission. Then the votaries come forward to espouse 
<A NAME="928"></A>the quarrel of the god, and set upon the opponents, who are sure to offer 
<A NAME="929"></A>resistance. A sharp fight with clubs ensues, in which heads are commonly 
<A NAME="930"></A>broken on both sides. Many, I am convinced, die of the wounds that they 
<A NAME="931"></A>receive, though the Egyptians insist that no one is ever 
<A NAME="932"></A>killed.
<A NAME="933"></A><BR><BR>The natives give the subjoined account of this festival. They say 
<A NAME="934"></A>that the mother of the god Mars once dwelt in the temple. Brought up at 
<A NAME="935"></A>a distance from his parent, when he grew to man's estate he conceived a 
<A NAME="936"></A>wish to visit her. Accordingly he came, but the attendants, who had never 
<A NAME="937"></A>seen him before, refused him entrance, and succeeded in keeping him out. 
<A NAME="938"></A>So he went to another city and collected a body of men, with whose aid 
<A NAME="939"></A>he handled the attendants very roughly, and forced his way in to his mother. 
<A NAME="940"></A>Hence they say arose the custom of a fight with sticks in honour of Mars 
<A NAME="941"></A>at this festival.
<A NAME="942"></A><BR><BR>The Egyptians first made it a point of religion to have no converse 
<A NAME="943"></A>with women in the sacred places, and not to enter them without washing, 
<A NAME="944"></A>after such converse. Almost all other nations, except the Greeks and the 
<A NAME="945"></A>Egyptians, act differently, regarding man as in this matter under no other 
<A NAME="946"></A>law than the brutes. Many animals, they say, and various kinds of birds, 
<A NAME="947"></A>may be seen to couple in the temples and the sacred precincts, which would 
<A NAME="948"></A>certainly not happen if the gods were displeased at it. Such are the arguments 
<A NAME="949"></A>by which they defend their practice, but I nevertheless can by no means 
<A NAME="950"></A>approve of it. In these points the Egyptians are specially careful, as 
<A NAME="951"></A>they are indeed in everything which concerns their sacred 
<A NAME="952"></A>edifices.
<A NAME="953"></A><BR><BR>Egypt, though it borders upon Libya, is not a region abounding 
<A NAME="954"></A>in wild animals. The animals that do exist in the country, whether domesticated 
<A NAME="955"></A>or otherwise, are all regarded as sacred. If I were to explain why they 
<A NAME="956"></A>are consecrated to the several gods, I should be led to speak of religious 
<A NAME="957"></A>matters, which I particularly shrink from mentioning; the points whereon 
<A NAME="958"></A>I have touched slightly hitherto have all been introduced from sheer necessity. 
<A NAME="959"></A>Their custom with respect to animals is as follows:- For every kind there 
<A NAME="960"></A>are appointed certain guardians, some male, some female, whose business 
<A NAME="961"></A>it is to look after them; and this honour is made to descend from father 
<A NAME="962"></A>to son. The inhabitants of the various cities, when they have made a vow 
<A NAME="963"></A>to any god, pay it to his animals in the way which I will now explain. 
<A NAME="964"></A>At the time of making the vow they shave the head of the child, cutting 
<A NAME="965"></A>off all the hair, or else half, or sometimes a third part, which they then 
<A NAME="966"></A>weigh in a balance against a sum of silver; and whatever sum the hair weighs 
<A NAME="967"></A>is presented to the guardian of the animals, who thereupon cuts up some 
<A NAME="968"></A>fish, and gives it to them for food- such being the stuff whereon they 
<A NAME="969"></A>are fed. When a man has killed one of the sacred animals, if he did it 
<A NAME="970"></A>with malice prepense, he is punished with death; if unwittingly, he has 
<A NAME="971"></A>to pay such a fine as the priests choose to impose. When an ibis, however, 
<A NAME="972"></A>or a hawk is killed, whether it was done by accident or on purpose, the 
<A NAME="973"></A>man must needs die.
<A NAME="974"></A><BR><BR>The number of domestic animals in Egypt is very great, and would 
<A NAME="975"></A>be still greater were it not for what befalls the cats. As the females, 
<A NAME="976"></A>when they have kittened, no longer seek the company of the males, these 
<A NAME="977"></A>last, to obtain once more their companionship, practise a curious artifice. 
<A NAME="978"></A>They seize the kittens, carry them off, and kill them, but do not cat them 
<A NAME="979"></A>afterwards. Upon this the females, being deprived of their young, and longing 
<A NAME="980"></A>to supply their place, seek the males once more, since they are particularly 
<A NAME="981"></A>fond of their offspring. On every occasion of a fire in Egypt the strangest 
<A NAME="982"></A>prodigy occurs with the cats. The inhabitants allow the fire to rage as 
<A NAME="983"></A>it pleases, while they stand about at intervals and watch these animals, 
<A NAME="984"></A>which, slipping by the men or else leaping over them, rush headlong into 
<A NAME="985"></A>the flames. When this happens, the Egyptians are in deep affliction. If 
<A NAME="986"></A>a cat dies in a private house by a natural death, all the inmates of the 
<A NAME="987"></A>house shave their eyebrows; on the death of a dog they shave the head and 
<A NAME="988"></A>the whole of the body.
<A NAME="989"></A><BR><BR>The cats on their decease are taken to the city of Bubastis, where 
<A NAME="990"></A>they are embalmed, after which they are buried in certain sacred repositories. 
<A NAME="991"></A>The dogs are interred in the cities to which they belong, also in sacred 
<A NAME="992"></A>burial-places. The same practice obtains with respect to the ichneumons; 
<A NAME="993"></A>the hawks and shrew-mice, on the contrary, are conveyed to the city of 
<A NAME="994"></A>Buto for burial, and the ibises to Hermopolis. The bears, which are scarce 
<A NAME="995"></A>in Egypt, and the wolves, which are not much bigger than foxes, they bury 
<A NAME="996"></A>wherever they happen to find them lying.
<A NAME="997"></A><BR><BR>The following are the peculiarities of the crocodile:- During the 
<A NAME="998"></A>four winter months they eat nothing; they are four-footed, and live indifferently 
<A NAME="999"></A>on land or in the water. The female lays and hatches her eggs ashore, passing 
<A NAME="1000"></A>the greater portion of the day on dry land, but at night retiring to the 
<A NAME="1001"></A>river, the water of which is warmer than the night-air and the dew. Of 
<A NAME="1002"></A>all known animals this is the one which from the smallest size grows to 
<A NAME="1003"></A>be the greatest: for the egg of the crocodile is but little bigger than 
<A NAME="1004"></A>that of the goose, and the young crocodile is in proportion to the egg; 
<A NAME="1005"></A>yet when it is full grown, the animal measures frequently seventeen cubits 
<A NAME="1006"></A>and even more. It has the eyes of a pig, teeth large and tusk-like, of 
<A NAME="1007"></A>a size proportioned to its frame; unlike any other animal, it is without 
<A NAME="1008"></A>a tongue; it cannot move its under-jaw, and in this respect too it is singular, 
<A NAME="1009"></A>being the only animal in the world which moves the upper-jaw but not the 
<A NAME="1010"></A>under. It has strong claws and a scaly skin, impenetrable upon the back. 
<A NAME="1011"></A>In the water it is blind, but on land it is very keen of sight. As it lives 
<A NAME="1012"></A>chiefly in the river, it has the inside of its mouth constantly covered 
<A NAME="1013"></A>with leeches; hence it happens that, while all the other birds and beasts 
<A NAME="1014"></A>avoid it, with the trochilus it lives at peace, since it owes much to that 
<A NAME="1015"></A>bird: for the crocodile, when he leaves the water and comes out upon the 
<A NAME="1016"></A>land, is in the habit of lying with his mouth wide open, facing the western 
<A NAME="1017"></A>breeze: at such times the trochilus goes into his mouth and devours the 
<A NAME="1018"></A>leeches. This benefits the crocodile, who is pleased, and takes care not 
<A NAME="1019"></A>to hurt the trochilus.
<A NAME="1020"></A><BR><BR>The crocodile is esteemed sacred by some of the Egyptians, by others 
<A NAME="1021"></A>he is treated as an enemy. Those who live near Thebes, and those who dwell 
<A NAME="1022"></A>around Lake Moeris, regard them with especial veneration. In each of these 
<A NAME="1023"></A>places they keep one crocodile in particular, who is taught to be tame 
<A NAME="1024"></A>and tractable. They adorn his ears with ear-rings of molten stone or gold, 
<A NAME="1025"></A>and put bracelets on his fore-paws, giving him daily a set portion of bread, 
<A NAME="1026"></A>with a certain number of victims; and, after having thus treated him with 
<A NAME="1027"></A>the greatest possible attention while alive, they embalm him when he dies 
<A NAME="1028"></A>and bury him in a sacred repository. The people of Elephantine on the other 
<A NAME="1029"></A>hand, are so far from considering these animals as sacred that they even 
<A NAME="1030"></A>eat their flesh. In the Egyptian language they are not called crocodiles, 
<A NAME="1031"></A>but Champsae. The name of crocodiles was given them by the Ionians, who 
<A NAME="1032"></A>remarked their resemblance to the lizards, which in Ionia live in the walls 
<A NAME="1033"></A>and are called crocodiles.
<A NAME="1034"></A><BR><BR>The modes of catching the crocodile are many and various. I shall 
<A NAME="1035"></A>only describe the one which seems to me most worthy of mention. They bait 
<A NAME="1036"></A>a hook with a chine of pork and let the meat be carried out into the middle 
<A NAME="1037"></A>of the stream, while the hunter upon the bank holds a living pig, which 
<A NAME="1038"></A>he belabours. The crocodile hears its cries, and making for the sound, 
<A NAME="1039"></A>encounters the pork, which he instantly swallows down. The men on the shore 
<A NAME="1040"></A>haul, and when they have got him to land, the first thing the hunter does 
<A NAME="1041"></A>is to plaster his eyes with mud. This once accomplished, the animal is 
<A NAME="1042"></A>despatched with ease, otherwise he gives great trouble.
<A NAME="1043"></A><BR><BR>The hippopotamus, in the canton of Papremis, is a sacred animal, 
<A NAME="1044"></A>but not in any other part of Egypt. It may be thus described:- It is a 
<A NAME="1045"></A>quadruped, cloven-footed, with hoofs like an ox, and a flat nose. It has 
<A NAME="1046"></A>the mane and tail of a horse, huge tusks which are very conspicuous, and 
<A NAME="1047"></A>a voice like a horse's neigh. In size it equals the biggest oxen, and its 
<A NAME="1048"></A>skin is so tough that when dried it is made into javelins.
<A NAME="1049"></A><BR><BR>Otters also are found in the Nile, and are considered sacred. Only 
<A NAME="1050"></A>two sorts of fish are venerated, that called the lepidotus and the eel. 
<A NAME="1051"></A>These are regarded as sacred to the Nile, as likewise among birds is the 
<A NAME="1052"></A>vulpanser, or fox-goose.
<A NAME="1053"></A><BR><BR>They have also another sacred bird called the phoenix which I myself 
<A NAME="1054"></A>have never seen, except in pictures. Indeed it is a great rarity, even 
<A NAME="1055"></A>in Egypt, only coming there (according to the accounts of the people of 
<A NAME="1056"></A>Heliopolis) once in five hundred years, when the old phoenix dies. Its 
<A NAME="1057"></A>size and appearance, if it is like the pictures, are as follow:- The plumage 
<A NAME="1058"></A>is partly red, partly golden, while the general make and size are almost 
<A NAME="1059"></A>exactly that of the eagle. They tell a story of what this bird does, which 
<A NAME="1060"></A>does not seem to me to be credible: that he comes all the way from Arabia, 
<A NAME="1061"></A>and brings the parent bird, all plastered over with myrrh, to the temple 
<A NAME="1062"></A>of the Sun, and there buries the body. In order to bring him, they say, 
<A NAME="1063"></A>he first forms a ball of myrrh as big as he finds that he can carry; then 
<A NAME="1064"></A>he hollows out the ball, and puts his parent inside, after which he covers 
<A NAME="1065"></A>over the opening with fresh myrrh, and the ball is then of exactly the 
<A NAME="1066"></A>same weight as at first; so he brings it to Egypt, plastered over as I 
<A NAME="1067"></A>have said, and deposits it in the temple of the Sun. Such is the story 
<A NAME="1068"></A>they tell of the doings of this bird.
<A NAME="1069"></A><BR><BR>In the neighbourhood of Thebes there are some sacred serpents which 
<A NAME="1070"></A>are perfectly harmless. They are of small size, and have two horns growing 
<A NAME="1071"></A>out of the top of the head. These snakes, when they die, are buried in 
<A NAME="1072"></A>the temple of Jupiter, the god to whom they are sacred.
<A NAME="1073"></A><BR><BR>I went once to a certain place in Arabia, almost exactly opposite 
<A NAME="1074"></A>the city of Buto, to make inquiries concerning the winged serpents. On 
<A NAME="1075"></A>my arrival I saw the back-bones and ribs of serpents in such numbers as 
<A NAME="1076"></A>it is impossible to describe: of the ribs there were a multitude of heaps, 
<A NAME="1077"></A>some great, some small, some middle-sized. The place where the bones lie 
<A NAME="1078"></A>is at the entrance of a narrow gorge between steep mountains, which there 
<A NAME="1079"></A>open upon a spacious plain communicating with the great plain of Egypt. 
<A NAME="1080"></A>The story goes that with the spring the winged snakes come flying from 
<A NAME="1081"></A>Arabia towards Egypt, but are met in this gorge by the birds called ibises, 
<A NAME="1082"></A>who forbid their entrance and destroy them all. The Arabians assert, and 
<A NAME="1083"></A>the Egyptians also admit, that it is on account of the service th
