<A NAME="start"></A>
<A NAME="10"></A><B>Urania</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>The Greeks engaged in the sea-service were the following. The Athenians 
<A NAME="12"></A>furnished a hundred and twenty-seven vessels to the fleet, which were manned 
<A NAME="13"></A>in part by the Plataeans, who, though unskilled in such matters, were led 
<A NAME="14"></A>by their active and daring spirit to undertake this duty; the Corinthians 
<A NAME="15"></A>furnished a contingent of forty vessels; the Megarians sent twenty; the 
<A NAME="16"></A>Chalcideans also manned twenty, which had been furnished to them by the 
<A NAME="17"></A>Athenians; the Eginetans came with eighteen; the Sicyonians with twelve; 
<A NAME="18"></A>the Lacedaemonians with ten; the Epidaurians with eight; the Eretrians 
<A NAME="19"></A>with seven; the Troezenians with five; the Styreans with two; and the Ceans 
<A NAME="20"></A>with two triremes and two penteconters. Last of all, the Locrians of Opus 
<A NAME="21"></A>came in aid with a squadron of seven penteconters.
<A NAME="22"></A><BR><BR>Such were the nations which furnished vessels to the fleet now 
<A NAME="23"></A>at Artemisium; and in mentioning them I have given the number of ships 
<A NAME="24"></A>furnished by each. The total number of the ships thus brought together, 
<A NAME="25"></A>without counting the penteconters, was two hundred and seventy-one; and 
<A NAME="26"></A>the captain, who had the chief command over the whole fleet, was Eurybiades 
<A NAME="27"></A>the son of Eurycleides. He was furnished by Sparta, since the allies had 
<A NAME="28"></A>said that "if a Lacedaemonian did not take the command, they would break 
<A NAME="29"></A>up the fleet, for never would they serve under the Athenians."
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>From the first, even earlier than the time when the embassy went 
<A NAME="31"></A>to Sicily to solicit alliance, there had been a talk of intrusting the 
<A NAME="32"></A>Athenians with the command at sea; but the allies were averse to the plan, 
<A NAME="33"></A>wherefore the Athenians did not press it; for there was nothing they had 
<A NAME="34"></A>so much at heart as the salvation of Greece, and they knew that, if they 
<A NAME="35"></A>quarrelled among themselves about the command, Greece would be brought 
<A NAME="36"></A>to ruin. Herein they judged rightly; for internal strife is a thing as 
<A NAME="37"></A>much worse than war carried on by a united people, as war itself is worse 
<A NAME="38"></A>than peace. The Athenians therefore, being so persuaded, did not push their 
<A NAME="39"></A>claims, but waived them, so long as they were in such great need of aid 
<A NAME="40"></A>from the other Greeks. And they afterwards showed their motive; for at 
<A NAME="41"></A>the time when the Persians had been driven from Greece, and were now threatened 
<A NAME="42"></A>by the Greeks in their own country, they took occasion of the insolence 
<A NAME="43"></A>of Pausanias to deprive the Lacedaemonians of their leadership. This, however, 
<A NAME="44"></A>happened afterwards.
<A NAME="45"></A><BR><BR>At the present time the Greeks, on their arrival at Artemisium, 
<A NAME="46"></A>when they saw the number of the ships which lay at anchor near Aphetae, 
<A NAME="47"></A>and the abundance of troops everywhere, feeling disappointed that matters 
<A NAME="48"></A>had gone with the barbarians so far otherwise than they had expected, and 
<A NAME="49"></A>full of alarm at what they saw, began to speak of drawing back from Artemisium 
<A NAME="50"></A>towards the inner parts of their country. So when the Euboeans heard what 
<A NAME="51"></A>was in debate, they went to Eurybiades, and besought him to wait a few 
<A NAME="52"></A>days, while they removed their children and their slaves to a place of 
<A NAME="53"></A>safety. But, as they found that they prevailed nothing, they left him and 
<A NAME="54"></A>went to Themistocles, the Athenian commander, to whom they gave a bribe 
<A NAME="55"></A>of thirty talents, on his promise that the fleet should remain and risk 
<A NAME="56"></A>a battle in defence of Euboea.
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR>And Themistocles succeeded in detaining the fleet in the way which 
<A NAME="58"></A>I will now relate. He made over to Eurybiades five talents out of the thirty 
<A NAME="59"></A>paid him, which he gave as if they came from himself; and having in this 
<A NAME="60"></A>way gained over the admiral, he addressed himself to Adeimantus, the son 
<A NAME="61"></A>of Ocytus, the Corinthian leader, who was the only remonstrant now, and 
<A NAME="62"></A>who still threatened to sail away from Artemisium and not wait for the 
<A NAME="63"></A>other captains. Addressing himself to this man, Themistocles said with 
<A NAME="64"></A>an oath- "Thou forsake us? By no means! I will pay thee better for remaining 
<A NAME="65"></A>than the Mede would for leaving thy friends"- and straightway he sent on 
<A NAME="66"></A>board the ship of Adeimantus a present of three talents of silver. So these 
<A NAME="67"></A>two captains were won by gifts, and came over to the views of Themistocles, 
<A NAME="68"></A>who was thereby enabled to gratify the wishes of the Euboeans. He likewise 
<A NAME="69"></A>made his own gain on the occasion; for he kept the rest of the money, and 
<A NAME="70"></A>no one knew of it. The commanders who took the gifts thought that the sums 
<A NAME="71"></A>were furnished by Athens, and had been sent to be used in this 
<A NAME="72"></A>way.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>Thus it came to pass that the Greeks stayed at Euboea and there 
<A NAME="74"></A>gave battle to the enemy.
<A NAME="75"></A><BR><BR>Now the battle was on this wise. The barbarians reached Aphetae 
<A NAME="76"></A>early in the afternoon, and then saw (as they had previously heard reported) 
<A NAME="77"></A>that a fleet of Greek ships, weak in number, lay at Artemisium. At once 
<A NAME="78"></A>they were eager to engage, fearing that the Greeks would fly, and hoping 
<A NAME="79"></A>to capture them before they should get away. They did not however think 
<A NAME="80"></A>it wise to make straight for the Greek station, lest the enemy should see 
<A NAME="81"></A>them as they bore down, and betake themselves to flight immediately; in 
<A NAME="82"></A>which case night might close in before they came up with the fugitives, 
<A NAME="83"></A>and so they might get clean off and make their escape from them; whereas 
<A NAME="84"></A>the Persians were minded not to let a single soul slip through their 
<A NAME="85"></A>hands.
<A NAME="86"></A><BR><BR>They therefore contrived a plan, which was the following:- They 
<A NAME="87"></A>detached two hundred of their ships from the rest, and- to prevent the 
<A NAME="88"></A>enemy from seeing them start- sent them round outside the island of Sciathos, 
<A NAME="89"></A>to make the circuit of Euboea by Caphareus and Geraestus, and so to reach 
<A NAME="90"></A>the Euripus. By this plan they thought to enclose the Greeks on every side; 
<A NAME="91"></A>for the ships detached would block up the only way by which they could 
<A NAME="92"></A>retreat, while the others would press upon them in front. With these designs 
<A NAME="93"></A>therefore they dispatched the two hundred ships, while they themselves 
<A NAME="94"></A>waited- since they did not mean to attack the Greeks upon that day, or 
<A NAME="95"></A>until they knew, by signal, of the arrival of the detachment which had 
<A NAME="96"></A>been ordered to sail round Euboea. Meanwhile they made a muster of the 
<A NAME="97"></A>other ships at Aphetae.
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR>Now the Persians had with them a man named Scyllias, a native of 
<A NAME="99"></A>Scione, who was the most expert diver of his day. At the time of the shipwreck 
<A NAME="100"></A>off Mount Pelion he had recovered for the Persians a great part of what 
<A NAME="101"></A>they lost; and at the same time he had taken care to obtain for himself 
<A NAME="102"></A>a good share of the treasure. He had for some time been wishing to go over 
<A NAME="103"></A>to the Greeks; but no good opportunity had offered till now, when the Persians 
<A NAME="104"></A>were making the muster of their ships. In what way he contrived to reach 
<A NAME="105"></A>the Greeks I am not able to say for certain: I marvel much if the tale 
<A NAME="106"></A>that is commonly told be true. 'Tis said he dived into the sea at Aphetae, 
<A NAME="107"></A>and did not once come to the surface till he reached Artemisium, a distance 
<A NAME="108"></A>of nearly eighty furlongs. Now many things are related of this man which 
<A NAME="109"></A>are plainly false; but some of the stories seem to be true. My own opinion 
<A NAME="110"></A>is that on this occasion he made the passage to Artemisium in a 
<A NAME="111"></A>boat.
<A NAME="112"></A><BR><BR>However this might be, Scyllias no sooner reached Artemisium than 
<A NAME="113"></A>he gave the Greek captains a full account of the damage done by the storm, 
<A NAME="114"></A>and likewise told them of the ships sent to make the circuit of 
<A NAME="115"></A>Euboea.
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR>So the Greeks on receiving these tidings held a council, whereat, 
<A NAME="117"></A>after much debate, it was resolved that they should stay quiet for the 
<A NAME="118"></A>present where they were, and remain at their moorings, but that after midnight 
<A NAME="119"></A>they should put out to sea, and encounter the ships which were on their 
<A NAME="120"></A>way round the island. Later in the day, when they found that no one meddled 
<A NAME="121"></A>with them, they formed a new plan, which was to wait till near evening, 
<A NAME="122"></A>and then sail out against the main body of the barbarians, for the purpose 
<A NAME="123"></A>of trying their mode of fight and skill in manoeuvring.
<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR>When the Persian commanders and crews saw the Greeks thus boldly 
<A NAME="125"></A>sailing towards them with their few ships, they thought them possessed 
<A NAME="126"></A>with madness, and went out to meet them, expecting (as indeed seemed likely 
<A NAME="127"></A>enough) that they would take all their vessels with the greatest ease. 
<A NAME="128"></A>The Greek ships were so few, and their own so far outnumbered them, and 
<A NAME="129"></A>sailed so much better, that they resolved, seeing their advantage, to encompass 
<A NAME="130"></A>their foe on every side. And now such of the Ionians as wished well to 
<A NAME="131"></A>the Grecian cause and served in the Persian fleet unwillingly, seeing their 
<A NAME="132"></A>countrymen surrounded, were sorely distressed; for they felt sure that 
<A NAME="133"></A>not one of them would ever make his escape, so poor an opinion had they 
<A NAME="134"></A>of the strength of the Greeks. On the other hand, such as saw with pleasure 
<A NAME="135"></A>the attack on Greece, now vied eagerly with each other which should be 
<A NAME="136"></A>the first to make prize of an Athenian ship, and thereby to secure himself 
<A NAME="137"></A>a rich reward from the king. For through both the hosts none were so much 
<A NAME="138"></A>accounted of as the Athenians.
<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR>The Greeks, at a signal, brought the sterns of their ships together 
<A NAME="140"></A>into a small compass, and turned their prows on every side towards the 
<A NAME="141"></A>barbarians; after which, at a second signal, although inclosed within a 
<A NAME="142"></A>narrow space, and closely pressed upon by the foe, yet they fell bravely 
<A NAME="143"></A>to work, and captured thirty ships of the barbarians, at the same time 
<A NAME="144"></A>taking prisoner Philaon, the son of Chersis, and brother of Gorgus king 
<A NAME="145"></A>of Salamis, a man of much repute in the fleet. The first who made prize 
<A NAME="146"></A>of a ship of the enemy was Lycomedes the son of Aeschreas, an Athenian, 
<A NAME="147"></A>who was afterwards adjudged the meed of valour. Victory however was still 
<A NAME="148"></A>doubtful when night came on, and put a stop to the combat. The Greeks sailed 
<A NAME="149"></A>back to Artemisium; and the barbarians returned to Aphetae, much surprised 
<A NAME="150"></A>at the result, which was far other than they had looked for. In this battle 
<A NAME="151"></A>only one of the Greeks who fought on the side of the king deserted and 
<A NAME="152"></A>joined his countrymen. This was Antidorus of Lemnos, whom the Athenians 
<A NAME="153"></A>rewarded for his desertion by the present of a piece of land in 
<A NAME="154"></A>Salamis.
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR>Evening had barely closed in when a heavy rain- it was about midsummer- 
<A NAME="156"></A>began to fall, which continued the whole night, with terrible thunderings 
<A NAME="157"></A>and lightnings from Mount Pelion: the bodies of the slain and the broken 
<A NAME="158"></A>pieces of the damaged ships were drifted in the direction of Aphetae, and 
<A NAME="159"></A>floated about the prows of the vessels there, disturbing the action of 
<A NAME="160"></A>the oars. The barbarians, hearing the storm, were greatly dismayed, expecting 
<A NAME="161"></A>certainly to perish, as they had fallen into such a multitude of misfortunes. 
<A NAME="162"></A>For before they were well recovered from the tempest and the wreck of their 
<A NAME="163"></A>vessels off Mount Pelion, they had been surprised by a sea-fight which 
<A NAME="164"></A>had taxed all their strength, and now the sea-fight was scarcely over when 
<A NAME="165"></A>they were exposed to floods of rain, and the rush of swollen streams into 
<A NAME="166"></A>the sea, and violent thunderings.
<A NAME="167"></A><BR><BR>If, however, they who lay at Aphetae passed a comfortless night, 
<A NAME="168"></A>far worse were the sufferings of those who had been sent to make the circuit 
<A NAME="169"></A>of Euboea; inasmuch as the storm fell on them out at sea, whereby the issue 
<A NAME="170"></A>was indeed calamitous. They were sailing along near the Hollows of Euboea, 
<A NAME="171"></A>when the wind began to rise and the rain to pour: overpowered by the force 
<A NAME="172"></A>of the gale, and driven they knew not whither, at the last they fell upon 
<A NAME="173"></A>rocks- Heaven so contriving, in order that the Persian fleet might not 
<A NAME="174"></A>greatly exceed the Greek, but be brought nearly to its level. This squadron, 
<A NAME="175"></A>therefore, was entirely lost about the Hollows of Euboea.
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR>The barbarians at Aphetae were glad when day dawned, and remained 
<A NAME="177"></A>in quiet at their station, content if they might enjoy a little peace after 
<A NAME="178"></A>so many sufferings. Meanwhile there came to the aid of the Greeks a reinforcement 
<A NAME="179"></A>of fifty-three ships from Attica. Their arrival, and the news (which reached 
<A NAME="180"></A>Artemisium about the same time) of the complete destruction by the storm 
<A NAME="181"></A>of the ships sent to sail round Euboea, greatly cheered the spirits of 
<A NAME="182"></A>the Greek sailors. So they waited again till the same hour as the day before, 
<A NAME="183"></A>and, once more putting out to sea, attacked the enemy. This time they fell 
<A NAME="184"></A>in with some Cilician vessels, which they sank; when night came on, they 
<A NAME="185"></A>withdrew to Artemisium.
<A NAME="186"></A><BR><BR>The third day was now come, and the captains of the barbarians, 
<A NAME="187"></A>ashamed that so small a number of ships should harass their fleet, and 
<A NAME="188"></A>afraid of the anger of Xerxes, instead of waiting for the others to begin 
<A NAME="189"></A>the battle, weighed anchor themselves, and advanced against the Greeks 
<A NAME="190"></A>about the hour of noon, with shouts encouraging one another. Now it happened 
<A NAME="191"></A>that these sea-fights took place on the very same days with the combats 
<A NAME="192"></A>at Thermopylae; and as the aim of the struggle was in the one case to maintain 
<A NAME="193"></A>the pass, so in the other it was to defend the Euripus. While the Greeks, 
<A NAME="194"></A>therefore, exhorted one another not to let the barbarians burst in upon 
<A NAME="195"></A>Greece, these latter shouted to their fellows to destroy the Grecian fleet, 
<A NAME="196"></A>and get possession of the channel.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>And now the fleet of Xerxes advanced in good order to the attack, 
<A NAME="198"></A>while the Greeks on their side remained quite motionless at Artemisium. 
<A NAME="199"></A>The Persians therefore spread themselves, and came forward in a half-moon, 
<A NAME="200"></A>seeking to encircle the Greeks on all sides, and thereby prevent them from 
<A NAME="201"></A>escaping. The Greeks, when they saw this, sailed out to meet their assailants; 
<A NAME="202"></A>and the battle forthwith began. In this engagement the two fleets contended 
<A NAME="203"></A>with no clear advantage to either- for the armament of Xerxes injured itself 
<A NAME="204"></A>by its own greatness, the vessels falling into disorder, and oft-times 
<A NAME="205"></A>running foul of one another; yet still they did not give way, but made 
<A NAME="206"></A>a stout fight, since the crews felt it would indeed be a disgrace to turn 
<A NAME="207"></A>and fly from a fleet so inferior in number. The Greeks therefore suffered 
<A NAME="208"></A>much, both in ships and men; but the barbarians experienced a far larger 
<A NAME="209"></A>loss of each. So the fleets separated after such a combat as I have 
<A NAME="210"></A>described.
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR>On the side of Xerxes the Egyptians distinguished themselves above 
<A NAME="212"></A>all the combatants; for besides performing many other noble deeds, they 
<A NAME="213"></A>took five vessels from the Greeks with their crews on board. On the side 
<A NAME="214"></A>of the Greeks the Athenians bore off the meed of valour; and among them 
<A NAME="215"></A>the most distinguished was Clinias, the son of Alcibiades, who served at 
<A NAME="216"></A>his own charge with two hundred men, on board a vessel which he had himself 
<A NAME="217"></A>furnished.
<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR>The two fleets, on separating, hastened very gladly to their anchorage-grounds. 
<A NAME="219"></A>The Greeks, indeed, when the battle was over, became masters of the bodies 
<A NAME="220"></A>of the slain and the wrecks of the vessels; but they had been so roughly 
<A NAME="221"></A>handled, especially the Athenians, one-half of whose vessels had suffered 
<A NAME="222"></A>damage, that they determined to break up from their station, and withdraw 
<A NAME="223"></A>to the inner parts of their country.
<A NAME="224"></A><BR><BR>Then Themistocles, who thought that if the Ionian and Carian ships 
<A NAME="225"></A>could be detached from the barbarian fleet, the Greeks might be well able 
<A NAME="226"></A>to defeat the rest, called the captains together. They met upon the seashore, 
<A NAME="227"></A>where the Euboeans were now assembling their flocks and herds; and here 
<A NAME="228"></A>Themistocles told them he thought that he knew of a plan whereby he could 
<A NAME="229"></A>detach from the king those who were of most worth among his allies. This 
<A NAME="230"></A>was all that he disclosed to them of his plan at that time. Meanwhile, 
<A NAME="231"></A>looking to the circumstances in which they were, he advised them to slaughter 
<A NAME="232"></A>as many of the Euboean cattle- they liked- for it was better (he said) 
<A NAME="233"></A>that their own troops should enjoy them than the enemy- and to give orders 
<A NAME="234"></A>to their men to kindle the fires as usual. With regard to the retreat, 
<A NAME="235"></A>he said that he would take upon himself to watch the proper moment, and 
<A NAME="236"></A>would manage matters so that they should return to Greece without loss. 
<A NAME="237"></A>These words pleased the captains; so they had the fires lighted, and began 
<A NAME="238"></A>the slaughter of the cattle.
<A NAME="239"></A><BR><BR>The Euboeans, until now, had made light of the oracle of Bacis, 
<A NAME="240"></A>as though it had been void of all significancy, and had neither removed 
<A NAME="241"></A>their goods from the island, nor yet taken them into their strong places; 
<A NAME="242"></A>as they would most certainly have done if they had believed that war was 
<A NAME="243"></A>approaching. By this neglect they had brought their affairs into the very 
<A NAME="244"></A>greatest danger. Now the oracle of which I speak ran as 
<A NAME="245"></A>follows:-
<A NAME="246"></A><BR><BR>When o'er the main shall be thrown a byblus yoke by a 
<A NAME="247"></A>stranger,
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>Be thou ware, and drive from Euboea the goats' loud-bleating. So, as 
<A NAME="249"></A>the Euboeans had paid no regard to this oracle when the evils approached 
<A NAME="250"></A>and impended, now that they had arrived, the worst was likely to befall 
<A NAME="251"></A>them.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR>While the Greeks were employed in the way described above, the 
<A NAME="253"></A>scout who had been on the watch at Trachis arrived at Artemisium. For the 
<A NAME="254"></A>Greeks had employed two watchers:- Polyas, a native of Anticyra, had been 
<A NAME="255"></A>stationed off Artemisium, with a row-boat at his command ready to sail 
<A NAME="256"></A>at any moment, his orders being that, if an engagement took place by sea, 
<A NAME="257"></A>he should convey the news at once to the Greeks at Thermopylae; and in 
<A NAME="258"></A>like manner Abronychus the son of Lysicles, an Athenian, had been stationed 
<A NAME="259"></A>with a triaconter near Leonidas, to be ready, in case of disaster befalling 
<A NAME="260"></A>the land force, to carry tidings of it to Artemisium. It was this Abronychus 
<A NAME="261"></A>who now arrived with news of what had befallen Leonidas and those who were 
<A NAME="262"></A>with him. When the Greeks heard the tidings they no longer delayed to retreat, 
<A NAME="263"></A>but withdrew in the order wherein they had been stationed, the Corinthians 
<A NAME="264"></A>leading, and the Athenians sailing last of all.
<A NAME="265"></A><BR><BR>And now Themistocles chose out the swiftest sailers from among 
<A NAME="266"></A>the Athenian vessels, and, proceeding to the various watering-places along 
<A NAME="267"></A>the coast, cut inscriptions on the rocks, which were read by the Ionians 
<A NAME="268"></A>the day following, on their arrival at Artemisium. The inscriptions ran 
<A NAME="269"></A>thus:- "Men of Ionia, ye do wrong to fight against your own fathers, and 
<A NAME="270"></A>to give your help to enslave Greece. We beseech you therefore to come over, 
<A NAME="271"></A>if possible, to our side: if you cannot do this, then, we pray you, stand 
<A NAME="272"></A>aloof from the contest yourselves, and persuade the Carians to do the like. 
<A NAME="273"></A>If neither of these things be possible, and you are hindered, by a force 
<A NAME="274"></A>too strong to resist, from venturing upon desertion, at least when we come 
<A NAME="275"></A>to blows fight backwardly, remembering that you are sprung from us, and 
<A NAME="276"></A>that it was through you we first provoked the hatred of the barbarian." 
<A NAME="277"></A>Themistocles, in putting up these inscriptions, looked, I believe, to two 
<A NAME="278"></A>chances- either Xerxes would not discover them, in which case they might 
<A NAME="279"></A>bring over the Ionians to the side of the Greeks; or they would be reported 
<A NAME="280"></A>to him and made a ground of accusation against the Ionians, who would thereupon 
<A NAME="281"></A>be distrusted, and would not be allowed to take part in the 
<A NAME="282"></A>sea-fights.
<A NAME="283"></A><BR><BR>Shortly after the cutting of the inscriptions, a man of Histiaea 
<A NAME="284"></A>went in a merchantship to Aphetae, and told the Persians that the Greeks 
<A NAME="285"></A>had fled from Artemisium. Disbelieving his report, the Persians kept the 
<A NAME="286"></A>man a prisoner, while they sent some of their fastest vessels to see what 
<A NAME="287"></A>had happened. These brought back word how matters stood; whereupon at sunrise 
<A NAME="288"></A>the whole fleet advanced together in a body, and sailed to Artemisium, 
<A NAME="289"></A>where they remained till mid-day; after which they went on to Histiaea. 
<A NAME="290"></A>That city fell into their hands immediately; and they shortly overran the 
<A NAME="291"></A>various villages upon the coast in the district of Hellopia, which was 
<A NAME="292"></A>part of the Histiaean territory.
<A NAME="293"></A><BR><BR>It was while they were at this station that a herald reached them 
<A NAME="294"></A>from Xerxes, whom he had sent after making the following dispositions with 
<A NAME="295"></A>respect to the bodies of those who fell at Thermopylae. Of the twenty thousand 
<A NAME="296"></A>who had been slain on the Persian side, he left one thousand upon the field 
<A NAME="297"></A>while he buried the rest in trenches; and these he carefully filled up 
<A NAME="298"></A>with earth, and hid with foliage, that the sailors might not see any signs 
<A NAME="299"></A>of them. The herald, on reaching Histiaea, caused the whole force to be 
<A NAME="300"></A>collected together, and spake thus to them:
<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR>"Comrades, King Xerxes gives permission to all who please, to quit 
<A NAME="302"></A>their posts, and see how he fights with the senseless men who think to 
<A NAME="303"></A>overthrow his armies."
<A NAME="304"></A><BR><BR>No sooner had these words been uttered, than it became difficult 
<A NAME="305"></A>to get a boat, so great was the number of those who desired to see the 
<A NAME="306"></A>sight. Such as went crossed the strait, and passing among the heaps of 
<A NAME="307"></A>dead, in this way viewed the spectacle. Many helots were included in the 
<A NAME="308"></A>slain, but every one imagined that the bodies were all either Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="309"></A>or Thespians. However, no one was deceived by what Xerxes had done with 
<A NAME="310"></A>his own dead. It was indeed most truly a laughable device- on the one side 
<A NAME="311"></A>a thousand men were seen lying about the field, on the other four thousand 
<A NAME="312"></A>crowded together into one spot. This day then was given up to sight-seeing; 
<A NAME="313"></A>on the next the seamen embarked on board their ships and sailed back to 
<A NAME="314"></A>Histiaea, while Xerxes and his army proceeded upon their 
<A NAME="315"></A>march.
<A NAME="316"></A><BR><BR>There came now a few deserters from Arcadia to join the Persians- 
<A NAME="317"></A>poor men who had nothing to live on, and were in want of employment. The 
<A NAME="318"></A>Persians brought them into the king's presence, and there inquired of them, 
<A NAME="319"></A>by a man who acted as their spokesman, "what the Greeks were doing?" The 
<A NAME="320"></A>Arcadians answered- "They are holding the Olympic Games, seeing the athletic 
<A NAME="321"></A>sports and the chariot-races." "And what," said the man, "is the prize 
<A NAME="322"></A>for which they contend?" "An olive-wreath," returned the others, "which 
<A NAME="323"></A>is given to the man who wins." On hearing this, Tritantaechmes, the son 
<A NAME="324"></A>of Artabanus, uttered a speech which was in truth most noble, but which 
<A NAME="325"></A>caused him to be taxed with cowardice by King Xerxes. Hearing the men say 
<A NAME="326"></A>that the prize was not money but a wreath of olive, he could not forbear 
<A NAME="327"></A>from exclaiming before them all: "Good heavens! Mardonius, what manner 
<A NAME="328"></A>of men are these against whom thou hast brought us to fight?- men who contend 
<A NAME="329"></A>with one another, not for money, but for honour!"
<A NAME="330"></A><BR><BR>A little before this, and just after the blow had been struck at 
<A NAME="331"></A>Thermopylae, a herald was sent into Phocis by the Thessalians, who had 
<A NAME="332"></A>always been on bad terms with the Phocians, and especially since their 
<A NAME="333"></A>last overthrow. For it was not many years previous to this invasion of 
<A NAME="334"></A>Greece by the king, that the Thessalians, with their allies, entered Phocis 
<A NAME="335"></A>in full force, but were defeated by the Phocians in an engagement wherein 
<A NAME="336"></A>they were very roughly handled. The Phocians, who had with them as soothsayer 
<A NAME="337"></A>Tellias of Elis, were blocked up in the mountain of Parnassus, when the 
<A NAME="338"></A>following stratagem was contrived for them by their Elean ally. He took 
<A NAME="339"></A>six hundred of their bravest men, and whitened their bodies and their arms 
<A NAME="340"></A>with chalk; then instructing them to slay every one whom they should meet 
<A NAME="341"></A>that was not whitened like themselves, he made a night attack upon the 
<A NAME="342"></A>Thessalians. No sooner did the Thessalian sentries, who were the first 
<A NAME="343"></A>to see them, behold this strange sight, than, imagining it to be a prodigy, 
<A NAME="344"></A>they were all filled with affright. From the sentries the alarm spread 
<A NAME="345"></A>to the army, which was seized with such a panic that the Phocians killed 
<A NAME="346"></A>four thousand of them, and became masters of their dead bodies and shields. 
<A NAME="347"></A>Of the shields one half were sent as an offering to the temple at Abae, 
<A NAME="348"></A>the other half were deposited at Delphi; while from the tenth part of the 
<A NAME="349"></A>booty gained in the battle, were made the gigantic figures which stand 
<A NAME="350"></A>round the tripod in front of the Delphic shrine, and likewise the figures 
<A NAME="351"></A>of the same size and character at Abae.
<A NAME="352"></A><BR><BR>Besides this slaughter of the Thessalian foot when it was blockading 
<A NAME="353"></A>them, the Phocians had dealt a blow to their horse upon its invading their 
<A NAME="354"></A>territory, from which they had never recovered. There is a pass near the 
<A NAME="355"></A>city of Hyampolis, where the Phocians, having dug a broad trench, filled 
<A NAME="356"></A>up the void with empty wine-jars, after which they covered the place with 
<A NAME="357"></A>mould, so that the ground all looked alike, and then awaited the coming 
<A NAME="358"></A>of the Thessalians. These, thinking to destroy the Phocians at one sweep, 
<A NAME="359"></A>rushed rapidly forward, and became entangled in the wine-jars, which broke 
<A NAME="360"></A>the legs of their horses.
<A NAME="361"></A><BR><BR>The Thessalians had therefore a double cause of quarrel with the 
<A NAME="362"></A>Phocians, when they dispatched the herald above mentioned, who thus delivered 
<A NAME="363"></A>his message:-
<A NAME="364"></A><BR><BR>"At length acknowledge, ye men of Phocis, that ye may not think 
<A NAME="365"></A>to match with us. In times past, when it pleased us to hold with the Greeks, 
<A NAME="366"></A>we had always the vantage over you; and now our influence is such with 
<A NAME="367"></A>the barbarian, that, if we choose it, you will lose your country, and (what 
<A NAME="368"></A>is even worse) you will be sold as slaves. However, though we can now do 
<A NAME="369"></A>with you exactly as we like, we are willing to forget our wrongs. Quit 
<A NAME="370"></A>them with a payment of fifty talents of silver, and we undertake to ward 
<A NAME="371"></A>off the evils which threaten your country."
<A NAME="372"></A><BR><BR>Such was the message which the Thessalians sent. The Phocians were 
<A NAME="373"></A>the only people in these parts who had not espoused the cause of the Medes; 
<A NAME="374"></A>and it is my deliberate opinion that the motive which swayed them was none 
<A NAME="375"></A>other- neither more nor less- than their hatred of the Thessalians: for 
<A NAME="376"></A>had the Thessalians declared in favour of the Greeks, I believe that the 
<A NAME="377"></A>men of Phocis would have joined the Median side. As it was, when the message 
<A NAME="378"></A>arrived, the Phocians made answer, that "they would not pay anything- it 
<A NAME="379"></A>was open to them, equally with the Thessalians, to make common cause with 
<A NAME="380"></A>the Medes, if they only chose so to do- but they would never of their own 
<A NAME="381"></A>free will become traitors to Greece."
<A NAME="382"></A><BR><BR>On the return of this answer, the Thessalians, full of wrath against 
<A NAME="383"></A>the Phocians, offered themselves as guides to the barbarian army, and led 
<A NAME="384"></A>them forth from Trachinia into Doris. In this place there is a narrow tongue 
<A NAME="385"></A>of Dorian territory, not more than thirty furlongs across, interposed between 
<A NAME="386"></A>Malis and Phocis; it is the tract in ancient times called Dryopis; and 
<A NAME="387"></A>the land, of which it is a part, is the mother-country of the Dorians in 
<A NAME="388"></A>the Peloponnese. This territory the barbarians did not plunder, for the 
<A NAME="389"></A>inhabitants had espoused their side; and besides, the Thessalians wished 
<A NAME="390"></A>that they should be spared.
<A NAME="391"></A><BR><BR>From Doris they marched forward into Phocis; but here the inhabitants 
<A NAME="392"></A>did not fall into their power: for some of them had taken refuge in the 
<A NAME="393"></A>high grounds of Parnassus- one summit of which, called Tithorea, standing 
<A NAME="394"></A>quite by itself, not far from the city of Neon, is well fitted to give 
<A NAME="395"></A>shelter to a large body of men, and had now received a number of the Phocians 
<A NAME="396"></A>with their movables; while the greater portion had fled to the country 
<A NAME="397"></A>of the Ozolian Locrians, and placed their goods in the city called Amphissa, 
<A NAME="398"></A>which lies above the Crissaean plain. The land of Phocis, however, was 
<A NAME="399"></A>entirely overrun, for the Thessalians led the Persian army through the 
<A NAME="400"></A>whole of it; and wherever they went, the country was wasted with fire and 
<A NAME="401"></A>sword, the cities and even the temples being wilfully set alight by the 
<A NAME="402"></A>troops.
<A NAME="403"></A><BR><BR>The march of the army lay along the valley of the Cephissus; and 
<A NAME="404"></A>here they ravaged far and wide, burning the towns of Drymus, Charadra, 
<A NAME="405"></A>Erochus, Tethronium, Amphicaea, Neon, Pedieis, Triteis, Elateia, Hyampolis, 
<A NAME="406"></A>Parapotamii, and Abae. At the last-named place there was a temple of Apollo, 
<A NAME="407"></A>very rich, and adorned with a vast number of treasures and offerings. There 
<A NAME="408"></A>was likewise an oracle there in those days, as indeed there is at the present 
<A NAME="409"></A>time. This temple the Persians plundered and burnt; and here they captured 
<A NAME="410"></A>a number of the Phocians before they could reach the hills, and caused 
<A NAME="411"></A>the death of some of their women by ill-usage.
<A NAME="412"></A><BR><BR>After passing Parapotamii, the barbarians marched to Panopeis; 
<A NAME="413"></A>and now the army separated into two bodies, whereof one, which was the 
<A NAME="414"></A>more numerous and the stronger of the two, marched, under Xerxes himself, 
<A NAME="415"></A>towards Athens, entering Boeotia by the country of the Orchomenians. The 
<A NAME="416"></A>Boeotians had one and all embraced the cause of the Medes; and their towns 
<A NAME="417"></A>were in the possession of Macedonian garrisons, whom Alexander had sent 
<A NAME="418"></A>there, to make it manifest to Xerxes that the Boeotians were on the Median 
<A NAME="419"></A>side. Such then was the road followed by one division of the 
<A NAME="420"></A>barbarians.
<A NAME="421"></A><BR><BR>The other division took guides, and proceeded towards the temple 
<A NAME="422"></A>of Delphi, keeping Mount Parnassus on their right hand. They too laid waste 
<A NAME="423"></A>such parts of Phocis as they passed through, burning the city of the Panopeans, 
<A NAME="424"></A>together with those of the Daulians and of the Aeolidae. This body had 
<A NAME="425"></A>been detached from the rest of the army, and made to march in this direction, 
<A NAME="426"></A>for the purpose of plundering the Delphian temple and conveying to King 
<A NAME="427"></A>Xerxes the riches which were there laid up. For Xerxes, as I am informed, 
<A NAME="428"></A>was better acquainted with what there was worthy of note at Delphi, than 
<A NAME="429"></A>even with what he had left in his own house; so many of those about him 
<A NAME="430"></A>were continually describing the treasures- more especially the offerings 
<A NAME="431"></A>made by Croesus the son of Alyattes.
<A NAME="432"></A><BR><BR>Now when the Delphians heard what danger they were in, great fear 
<A NAME="433"></A>fell on them. In their terror they consulted the oracle concerning the 
<A NAME="434"></A>holy treasures, and inquired if they should bury them in the ground, or 
<A NAME="435"></A>carry them away to some other country. The god, in reply, bade them leave 
<A NAME="436"></A>the treasures untouched- "He was able," he said, "without help to protect 
<A NAME="437"></A>his own." So the Delphians, when they received this answer, began to think 
<A NAME="438"></A>about saving themselves. And first of all they sent their women and children 
<A NAME="439"></A>across the gulf into Achaea; after which the greater number of them climbed 
<A NAME="440"></A>up into the tops of Parnassus, and placed their goods for safety in the 
<A NAME="441"></A>Corycian cave; while some effected their escape to Amphissa in Locris. 
<A NAME="442"></A>In this way all the Delphians quitted the city, except sixty men, and the 
<A NAME="443"></A>Prophet.
<A NAME="444"></A><BR><BR>When the barbarian assailants drew near and were in sight of the 
<A NAME="445"></A>place, the Prophet, who was named Aceratus, beheld, in front of the temple, 
<A NAME="446"></A>a portion of the sacred armour, which it was not lawful for any mortal 
<A NAME="447"></A>hand to touch, lying upon the ground, removed from the inner shrine where 
<A NAME="448"></A>it was wont to hang. Then went he and told the prodigy to the Delphians 
<A NAME="449"></A>who had remained behind. Meanwhile the enemy pressed forward briskly, and 
<A NAME="450"></A>had reached the shrine of Minerva Pronaia, when they were overtaken by 
<A NAME="451"></A>other prodigies still more wonderful than the first. Truly it was marvel 
<A NAME="452"></A>enough, when warlike harness was seen lying outside the temple, removed 
<A NAME="453"></A>there by no power but its own; what followed, however, exceeded in strangeness 
<A NAME="454"></A>all prodigies that had ever before been seen. The barbarians had just reached 
<A NAME="455"></A>in their advance the chapel of Minerva Pronaia, when a storm of thunder 
<A NAME="456"></A>burst suddenly over their heads- at the same time two crags split off from 
<A NAME="457"></A>Mount Parnassus, and rolled down upon them with a loud noise, crushing 
<A NAME="458"></A>vast numbers beneath their weight- while from the temple of Minerva there 
<A NAME="459"></A>went up the war-cry and the shout of victory.
<A NAME="460"></A><BR><BR>All these things together struck terror into the barbarians, who 
<A NAME="461"></A>forthwith turned and fled. The Delphians, seeing this, came down from their 
<A NAME="462"></A>hiding-places, and smote them with a great slaughter, from which such as 
<A NAME="463"></A>escaped fled straight into Boeotia. These men, on their return, declared 
<A NAME="464"></A>(as I am told) that besides the marvels mentioned above, they witnessed 
<A NAME="465"></A>also other supernatural sights. Two armed warriors, they said, of a stature 
<A NAME="466"></A>more than human, pursued after their flying ranks, pressing them close 
<A NAME="467"></A>and slaying them.
<A NAME="468"></A><BR><BR>These men, the Delphians maintain, were two Heroes belonging to 
<A NAME="469"></A>the place- by name Phylacus and Autonous- each of whom has a sacred precinct 
<A NAME="470"></A>near the temple; one, that of Phylacus, hard by the road which runs above 
<A NAME="471"></A>the temple of Pronaia; the other, that of Autonous, near the Castalian 
<A NAME="472"></A>spring, at the foot of the peak called Hyampeia. The blocks of stone which 
<A NAME="473"></A>fell from Parnassus might still be seen in my day; they lay in the precinct 
<A NAME="474"></A>of Pronaia, where they stopped, after rolling through the host of the barbarians. 
<A NAME="475"></A>Thus was this body of men forced to retire from the 
<A NAME="476"></A>temple.
<A NAME="477"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile, the Grecian fleet, which had left Artemisium, proceeded 
<A NAME="478"></A>to Salamis, at the request of the Athenians, and there cast anchor. The 
<A NAME="479"></A>Athenians had begged them to take up this position, in order that they 
<A NAME="480"></A>might convey their women and children out of Attica, and further might 
<A NAME="481"></A>deliberate upon the course which it now behoved them to follow. Disappointed 
<A NAME="482"></A>in the hopes which they had previously entertained, they were about to 
<A NAME="483"></A>hold a council concerning the present posture of their affairs. For they 
<A NAME="484"></A>had looked to see the Peloponnesians drawn up in full force to resist the 
<A NAME="485"></A>enemy in Boeotia, but found nothing of what they had expected; nay, they 
<A NAME="486"></A>learnt that the Greeks of those parts, only concerning themselves about 
<A NAME="487"></A>their own safety, were building a wall across the Isthmus, and intended 
<A NAME="488"></A>to guard the Peloponnese, and let the rest of Greece take its chance. These 
<A NAME="489"></A>tidings caused them to make the request whereof I spoke, that the combined 
<A NAME="490"></A>fleet should anchor at Salamis.
<A NAME="491"></A><BR><BR>So while the rest of the fleet lay to off this island, the Athenians 
<A NAME="492"></A>cast anchor along their own coast. Immediately upon their arrival, proclamation 
<A NAME="493"></A>was made that every Athenian should save his children and household as 
<A NAME="494"></A>he best could; whereupon some sent their families to Egina, some to Salamis, 
<A NAME="495"></A>but the greater number to Troezen. This removal was made with all possible 
<A NAME="496"></A>haste, partly from a desire to obey the advice of the oracle, but still 
<A NAME="497"></A>more for another reason. The Athenians say that they have in their Acropolis 
<A NAME="498"></A>a huge serpent, which lives in the temple, and is the guardian of the whole 
<A NAME="499"></A>place. Nor do they only say this, but, as if the serpent really dwelt there, 
<A NAME="500"></A>every month they lay out its food, which consists of a honey-cake. Up to 
<A NAME="501"></A>this time the honey-cake had always been consumed; but now it remained 
<A NAME="502"></A>untouched. So the priestess told the people what had happened; whereupon 
<A NAME="503"></A>they left Athens the more readily, since they believed that the goddess 
<A NAME="504"></A>had already abandoned the citadel. As soon as all was removed, the Athenians 
<A NAME="505"></A>sailed back to their station.
<A NAME="506"></A><BR><BR>And now, the remainder of the Grecian sea-force, hearing that the 
<A NAME="507"></A>fleet which had been at Artemisium, was come to Salamis, joined it at that 
<A NAME="508"></A>island from Troezen- orders having been issued previously that the ships 
<A NAME="509"></A>should muster at Pogon, the port of the Troezenians. The vessels collected 
<A NAME="510"></A>were many more in number than those which had fought at Artemisium, and 
<A NAME="511"></A>were furnished by more cities. The admiral was the same who had commanded 
<A NAME="512"></A>before, to wit, Eurybiades, the son of Eurycleides, who was a Spartan, 
<A NAME="513"></A>but not of the family of the kings: the city, however, which sent by far 
<A NAME="514"></A>the greatest number of ships, and the best sailers, was 
<A NAME="515"></A>Athens.
<A NAME="516"></A><BR><BR>Now these were the nations who composed the Grecian fleet. From 
<A NAME="517"></A>the Peloponnese, the following- the Lacedaemonians with six, teen ships; 
<A NAME="518"></A>the Corinthians with the same number as at Artemisium; the Sicyonians with 
<A NAME="519"></A>fifteen; the Epidaurians with ten; the Troezenians with five; and the Hermionians 
<A NAME="520"></A>with three. These were Dorians and Macedonians all of them (except those 
<A NAME="521"></A>from Hermione), and had emigrated last from Erineus, Pindus, and Dryopis. 
<A NAME="522"></A>The Hermionians were Dryopians, of the race which Hercules and the Malians 
<A NAME="523"></A>drove out of the land now called Doris. Such were the Peloponnesian 
<A NAME="524"></A>nations.
<A NAME="525"></A><BR><BR>From the mainland of Greece beyond the Peloponnese, came the Athenians 
<A NAME="526"></A>with a hundred and eighty ships, a greater number than that furnished by 
<A NAME="527"></A>any other people; and these were now manned wholly by themselves; for the 
<A NAME="528"></A>Plataeans did not serve aboard the Athenian ships at Salamis, owing to 
<A NAME="529"></A>the following reason. When the Greeks, on their withdrawal from Artemisium, 
<A NAME="530"></A>arrived off Chalcis, the Plataeans disembarked upon the opposite shore 
<A NAME="531"></A>of Boeotia, and set to work to remove their households, whereby it happened 
<A NAME="532"></A>that they were left behind. (The Athenians, when the region which is now 
<A NAME="533"></A>called Greece was held by the Pelasgi, were Pelasgians, and bore the name 
<A NAME="534"></A>of Cranaans; but under their king Cecrops, they were called Cecropidae; 
<A NAME="535"></A>when Erechtheus got the sovereignty, they changed their name to Athenians; 
<A NAME="536"></A>and when Ion, the son of Xuthus, became their general, they were named 
<A NAME="537"></A>after him Ionians.)
<A NAME="538"></A><BR><BR>The Megarians served with the same number of ships as at Artemisium; 
<A NAME="539"></A>the Ambraciots came with seven; the Leucadians (who were Dorians from Corinth) 
<A NAME="540"></A>with three.
<A NAME="541"></A><BR><BR>Of the islanders, the Eginetans furnished thirty ships- they had 
<A NAME="542"></A>a larger number equipped; but some were kept back to guard their own coasts, 
<A NAME="543"></A>and only thirty, which however were their best sailers, took part in the 
<A NAME="544"></A>fight at Salamis. (The Eginetans are Dorians from Epidaurus; their island 
<A NAME="545"></A>was called formerly Oenone). The Chalcideans came next in order; they furnished 
<A NAME="546"></A>the twenty ships with which they had served at Artemisium. The Eretrians 
<A NAME="547"></A>likewise furnished their seven. These races are Ionian. Ceos gave its old 
<A NAME="548"></A>number- the Ceans are Ionians from Attica. Naxos furnished four: this detachment, 
<A NAME="549"></A>like those from the other islands, had been sent by the citizens at home 
<A NAME="550"></A>to join the Medes; but they made light of the orders given them, and joined 
<A NAME="551"></A>the Greeks, at the instigation of Democritus, a citizen of good report, 
<A NAME="552"></A>who was at that time captain of a trireme. The Naxians are Ionians, of 
<A NAME="553"></A>the Athenian stock. The Styreans served with the same ships as before; 
<A NAME="554"></A>the Cythnians contributed one, and likewise a penteconter- these two nations 
<A NAME="555"></A>are Dryopians: the Seriphians, Siphnians, and Melians, also served; they 
<A NAME="556"></A>were the only islanders who had not given earth and water to the 
<A NAME="557"></A>barbarian.
<A NAME="558"></A><BR><BR>All these nations dwelt inside the river Acheron and the country 
<A NAME="559"></A>inhabited by the Thesprotians; for that people borders on the Ambraciots 
<A NAME="560"></A>and Leucadians, who are the most remote of all those by whom the fleet 
<A NAME="561"></A>was furnished. From the countries beyond, there was only one people which 
<A NAME="562"></A>gave help to the Greeks in their danger. This was the people of Crotona, 
<A NAME="563"></A>who contributed a single ship, under the command of Phayllus, a man who 
<A NAME="564"></A>had thrice carried off the prize at the Pythian Games. The Crotoniats are, 
<A NAME="565"></A>by descent, Achaeans.
<A NAME="566"></A><BR><BR>Most of the allies came with triremes; but the Melians, Siphnians, 
<A NAME="567"></A>and Seriphians, brought penteconters. The Melians, who draw their race 
<A NAME="568"></A>from Lacedaemon, furnished two; the Siphnians and Seriphians, who are Ionians 
<A NAME="569"></A>of the Athenian stock, one each. The whole number of the ships, without 
<A NAME="570"></A>counting the penteconters, was three hundred and seventy-eight.
<A NAME="571"></A><BR><BR>When the captains from these various nations were come together 
<A NAME="572"></A>at Salamis, a council of war was summoned; and Eurybiades proposed that 
<A NAME="573"></A>any one who liked to advise, should say which place seemed to him the fittest, 
<A NAME="574"></A>among those still in the possession of the Greeks, to be the scene of a 
<A NAME="575"></A>naval combat. Attica, he said, was not to be thought of now; but he desired 
<A NAME="576"></A>their counsel as to the remainder. The speakers mostly advised that the 
<A NAME="577"></A>fleet should sail away to the Isthmus, and there give battle in defence 
<A NAME="578"></A>of the Peloponnese; and they urged as a reason for this, that if they were 
<A NAME="579"></A>worsted in a sea-fight at Salamis, they would be shut up in an island where 
<A NAME="580"></A>they could get no help; but if they were beaten near the Isthmus, they 
<A NAME="581"></A>could escape to their homes.
<A NAME="582"></A><BR><BR>As the captains from the Peloponnese were thus advising, there 
<A NAME="583"></A>came an Athenian to the camp, who brought word that the barbarians had 
<A NAME="584"></A>entered Attica, and were ravaging and burning everything. For the division 
<A NAME="585"></A>of the army under Xerxes was just arrived at Athens from its march through 
<A NAME="586"></A>Boeotia, where it had burnt Thespiae and Plataea- both which cities were 
<A NAME="587"></A>forsaken by their inhabitants, who had fled to the Peloponnese- and now 
<A NAME="588"></A>it was laying waste all the possessions of the Athenians. Thespiae and 
<A NAME="589"></A>Plataea had been burnt by the Persians, because they knew from the Thebans 
<A NAME="590"></A>that neither of those cities had espoused their side.
<A NAME="591"></A><BR><BR>Since the passage of the Hellespont and the commencement of the 
<A NAME="592"></A>march upon Greece, a space of four months had gone by; one, while the army 
<A NAME="593"></A>made the crossing, and delayed about the region of the Hellespont; and 
<A NAME="594"></A>three while they proceeded thence to Attica, which they entered in the 
<A NAME="595"></A>archonship of Calliades. They found the city forsaken; a few people only 
<A NAME="596"></A>remained in the temple, either keepers of the treasures, or men of the 
<A NAME="597"></A>poorer sort. These persons having fortified the citadel with planks and 
<A NAME="598"></A>boards, held out against the enemy. It was in some measure their poverty 
<A NAME="599"></A>which had prevented them from seeking shelter in Salamis; but there was 
<A NAME="600"></A>likewise another reason which in part induced them to remain. They imagined 
<A NAME="601"></A>themselves to have discovered the true meaning of the oracle uttered by 
<A NAME="602"></A>the Pythoness, which promised that "the wooden wall" should never be taken- 
<A NAME="603"></A>the wooden wall, they thought, did not mean the ships, but the place where 
<A NAME="604"></A>they had taken refuge.
<A NAME="605"></A><BR><BR>The Persians encamped upon the hill over against the citadel, which 
<A NAME="606"></A>is called Mars' hill by the Athenians, and began the siege of the place, 
<A NAME="607"></A>attacking the Greeks with arrows whereto pieces of lighted tow were attached, 
<A NAME="608"></A>which they shot at the barricade. And now those who were within the citadel 
<A NAME="609"></A>found themselves in a most woeful case; for their wooden rampart betrayed 
<A NAME="610"></A>them; still, however, they continued to resist. It was in vain that the 
<A NAME="611"></A>Pisistratidae came to them and offered terms of surrender- they stoutly 
<A NAME="612"></A>refused all parley, and among their other modes of defence, rolled down 
<A NAME="613"></A>huge masses of stone upon the barbarians as they were mounting up to the 
<A NAME="614"></A>gates: so that Xerxes was for a long time very greatly perplexed, and could 
<A NAME="615"></A>not contrive any way to take them.
<A NAME="616"></A><BR><BR>At last, however, in the midst of these many difficulties, the 
<A NAME="617"></A>barbarians made discovery of an access. For verily the oracle had spoken 
<A NAME="618"></A>truth; and it was fated that the whole mainland of Attica should fall beneath 
<A NAME="619"></A>the sway of the Persians. Right in front of the citadel, but behind the 
<A NAME="620"></A>gates and the common ascent- where no watch was kept, and no one would 
<A NAME="621"></A>have thought it possible that any foot of man could climb- a few soldiers 
<A NAME="622"></A>mounted from the sanctuary of Aglaurus, Cecrops' daughter, notwithstanding 
<A NAME="623"></A>the steepness of the precipice. As soon as the Athenians saw them upon 
<A NAME="624"></A>the summit, some threw themselves headlong from the wall, and so perished; 
<A NAME="625"></A>while others fled for refuge to the inner part of the temple. The Persians 
<A NAME="626"></A>rushed to the gates and opened them, after which they massacred the suppliants, 
<A NAME="627"></A>When all were slain, they plundered the temple, and fired every part of 
<A NAME="628"></A>the citadel.
<A NAME="629"></A><BR><BR>Xerxes, thus completely master of Athens, despatched a horseman 
<A NAME="630"></A>to Susa, with a message to Artabanus, informing him of his success hitherto. 
<A NAME="631"></A>The day after, he collected together all the Athenian exiles who had come 
<A NAME="632"></A>into Greece in his train, and bade them go up into the citadel, and there 
<A NAME="633"></A>offer sacrifice after their own fashion. I know not whether he had had 
<A NAME="634"></A>a dream which made him give this order, or whether he felt some remorse 
<A NAME="635"></A>on account of having set the temple on fire. However this may have been, 
<A NAME="636"></A>the exiles were not slow to obey the command given them.
<A NAME="637"></A><BR><BR>I will now explain why I have made mention of this circumstance: 
<A NAME="638"></A>there is a temple of Erechtheus the Earth-born, as he is called, in this 
<A NAME="639"></A>citadel, containing within it an olive-tree and a sea. The tale goes among 
<A NAME="640"></A>the Athenians, that they were placed there as witnesses by Neptune and 
<A NAME="641"></A>Minerva, when they had their contention about the country. Now this olive-tree 
<A NAME="642"></A>had been burnt with the rest of the temple when the barbarians took the 
<A NAME="643"></A>place. But when the Athenians, whom the king had commanded to offer sacrifice, 
<A NAME="644"></A>went up into the temple for the purpose, they found a fresh shoot, as much 
<A NAME="645"></A>as a cubit in length, thrown out from the old trunk. Such at least was 
<A NAME="646"></A>the account which these persons gave.
<A NAME="647"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile, at Salamis, the Greeks no sooner heard what had befallen 
<A NAME="648"></A>the Athenian citadel, than they fell into such alarm that some of the captains 
<A NAME="649"></A>did not even wait for the council to come to a vote, but embarked hastily 
<A NAME="650"></A>on board their vessels, and hoisted sail as though they would take to flight 
<A NAME="651"></A>immediately. The rest, who stayed at the council board, came to a vote 
<A NAME="652"></A>that the fleet should give battle at the Isthmus. Night now drew on; and 
<A NAME="653"></A>the captains, dispersing from the meeting, proceeded on board their respective 
<A NAME="654"></A>ships.
<A NAME="655"></A><BR><BR>Themistocles, as he entered his own vessel, was met by Mnesiphilus, 
<A NAME="656"></A>an Athenian, who asked him what the council had resolved to do. On learning 
<A NAME="657"></A>that the resolve was to stand away for the Isthmus, and there give battle 
<A NAME="658"></A>on behalf of the Peloponnese, Mnesiphilus exclaimed:-
<A NAME="659"></A><BR><BR>"If these men sail away from Salamis, thou wilt have no fight at 
<A NAME="660"></A>all for the one fatherland; for they will all scatter themselves to their 
<A NAME="661"></A>own homes; and neither Eurybiades nor any one else will be able to hinder 
<A NAME="662"></A>them, nor to stop the breaking up of the armament. Thus will Greece be 
<A NAME="663"></A>brought to ruin through evil counsels. But haste thee now; and, if there 
<A NAME="664"></A>be any possible way, seek to unsettle these resolves- mayhap thou mightest 
<A NAME="665"></A>persuade Eurybiades to change his mind, and continue 
<A NAME="666"></A>here."
<A NAME="667"></A><BR><BR>The suggestion greatly pleased Themistocles; and without answering 
<A NAME="668"></A>a word, he went straight to the vessel of Eurybiades. Arrived there, he 
<A NAME="669"></A>let him know that he wanted to speak with him on a matter touching the 
<A NAME="670"></A>public service. So Eurybiades bade him come on board, and say whatever 
<A NAME="671"></A>he wished. Then Themistocles, seating himself at his side, went over all 
<A NAME="672"></A>the arguments which he had heard from Mnesiphilus, pretending as if they 
<A NAME="673"></A>were his own, and added to them many new ones besides; until at last he 
<A NAME="674"></A>persuaded Eurybiades, by his importunity, to quit his ship and again collect 
<A NAME="675"></A>the captains to council.
<A NAME="676"></A><BR><BR>As soon as they were come, and before Eurybiades had opened to 
<A NAME="677"></A>them his purpose in assembling them together, Themistocles, as men are 
<A NAME="678"></A>wont to do when they are very anxious, spoke much to divers of them; whereupon 
<A NAME="679"></A>the Corinthian captain, Adeimantus, the son of Ocytus, observed- "Themistocles, 
<A NAME="680"></A>at the Games they who start too soon are scourged." "True," rejoined the 
<A NAME="681"></A>other in his excuse, "but they who wait too late are not 
<A NAME="682"></A>crowned."
<A NAME="683"></A><BR><BR>Thus he gave the Corinthian at this time a mild answer; and towards 
<A NAME="684"></A>Eurybiades himself he did not now use any of those arguments which he had 
<A NAME="685"></A>urged before, or say aught of the allies betaking themselves to flight 
<A NAME="686"></A>if once they broke up from Salamis; it would have been ungraceful for him, 
<A NAME="687"></A>when the confederates were present, to make accusation against any: but 
<A NAME="688"></A>he had recourse to quite a new sort of reasoning, and addressed him as 
<A NAME="689"></A>follows:-
<A NAME="690"></A><BR><BR>"With thee it rests, O Eurybiades! to save Greece, if thou wilt 
<A NAME="691"></A>only hearken unto me, and give the enemy battle here, rather than yield 
<A NAME="692"></A>to the advice of those among us, who would have the fleet withdrawn to 
<A NAME="693"></A>the Isthmus. Hear now, I beseech thee, and judge between the two courses. 
<A NAME="694"></A>At the Isthmus thou wilt fight in an open sea, which is greatly to our 
<A NAME="695"></A>disadvantage, since our ships are heavier and fewer in number than the 
<A NAME="696"></A>enemy's; and further, thou wilt in any case lose Salamis, Megara, and Egina, 
<A NAME="697"></A>even if all the rest goes well with us. The land and sea force of the Persians 
<A NAME="698"></A>will advance together; and thy retreat will but draw them towards the Peloponnese, 
<A NAME="699"></A>and so bring all Greece into peril. If, on the other hand, thou doest as 
<A NAME="700"></A>I advise, these are the advantages which thou wilt so secure: in the first 
<A NAME="701"></A>place, as we shall fight in a narrow sea with few ships against many, if 
<A NAME="702"></A>the war follows the common course, we shall gain a great victory; for to 
<A NAME="703"></A>fight in a narrow space is favourable to us- in an open sea, to them. Again, 
<A NAME="704"></A>Salamis will in this case be preserved, where we have placed our wives 
<A NAME="705"></A>and children. Nay, that very point by which ye set most store, is secured 
<A NAME="706"></A>as much by this course as by the other; for whether we fight here or at 
<A NAME="707"></A>the Isthmus, we shall equally give battle in defence of the Peloponnese. 
<A NAME="708"></A>Assuredly ye will not do wisely to draw the Persians upon that region. 
<A NAME="709"></A>For if things turn out as I anticipate, and we beat them by sea, then we 
<A NAME="710"></A>shall have kept your Isthmus free from the barbarians, and they will have 
<A NAME="711"></A>advanced no further than Attica, but from thence have fled back in disorder; 
<A NAME="712"></A>and we shall, moreover, have saved Megara, Egina, and Salamis itself, where 
<A NAME="713"></A>an oracle has said that we are to overcome our enemies. When men counsel 
<A NAME="714"></A>reasonably, reasonable success ensues; but when in their counsels they 
<A NAME="715"></A>reject reason, God does not choose to follow the wanderings of human 
<A NAME="716"></A>fancies."
<A NAME="717"></A><BR><BR>When Themistocles had thus spoken, Adeimantus the Corinthian again 
<A NAME="718"></A>attacked him, and bade him be silent, since he was a man without a city; 
<A NAME="719"></A>at the same time he called on Eurybiades not to put the question at the 
<A NAME="720"></A>instance of one who had no country, and urged that Themistocles should 
<A NAME="721"></A>show of what state he was envoy, before he gave his voice with the rest. 
<A NAME="722"></A>This reproach he made, because the city of Athens had been taken, and was 
<A NAME="723"></A>in the hands of the barbarians. Hereupon Themistocles spake many bitter 
<A NAME="724"></A>things against Adeimantus and the Corinthians generally; and for proof 
<A NAME="725"></A>that he had a country, reminded the captains, that with two hundred ships 
<A NAME="726"></A>at his command, all fully manned for battle, he had both city and territory 
<A NAME="727"></A>as good as theirs; since there was no Grecian state which could resist 
<A NAME="728"></A>his men if they were to make a descent.
<A NAME="729"></A><BR><BR>After this declaration, he turned to Eurybiades, and addressing 
<A NAME="730"></A>him with still greater warmth and earnestness- "If thou wilt stay here," 
<A NAME="731"></A>he said, "and behave like a brave man, all will be well- if not, thou wilt 
<A NAME="732"></A>bring Greece to ruin. For the whole fortune of the war depends on our ships. 
<A NAME="733"></A>Be thou persuaded by my words. If not, we will take our families on board, 
<A NAME="734"></A>and go, just as we are, to Siris, in Italy, which is ours from of old, 
<A NAME="735"></A>and which the prophecies declare we are to colonise some day or other. 
<A NAME="736"></A>You then, when you have lost allies like us, will hereafter call to mind 
<A NAME="737"></A>what I have now said."
<A NAME="738"></A><BR><BR>At these words of Themistocles, Eurybiades changed his determination; 
<A NAME="739"></A>principally, as I believe, because he feared that if he withdrew the fleet 
<A NAME="740"></A>to the Isthmus, the Athenians would sail away, and knew that without the 
<A NAME="741"></A>Athenians, the rest of their ships could be no match for the fleet of the 
<A NAME="742"></A>enemy. He therefore decided to remain, and give battle at 
<A NAME="743"></A>Salamis.
<A NAME="744"></A><BR><BR>And now, the different chiefs, notwithstanding their skirmish of 
<A NAME="745"></A>words, on learning the decision of Eurybiades, at once made ready for the 
<A NAME="746"></A>fight. Morning broke; and, just as the sun rose, the shock of an earthquake 
<A NAME="747"></A>was felt both on shore and at sea: whereupon the Greeks resolved to approach 
<A NAME="748"></A>the gods with prayer, and likewise to send and invite the Aeacids to their 
<A NAME="749"></A>aid. And this they did, with as much speed as they had resolved on it. 
<A NAME="750"></A>Prayers were offered to all the gods; and Telamon and Ajax were invoked 
<A NAME="751"></A>at once from Salamis, while a ship was sent to Egina to fetch Aeacus himself, 
<A NAME="752"></A>and the other Aeacids.
<A NAME="753"></A><BR><BR>The following is a tale which was told by Dicaeus, the son of Theocydes, 
<A NAME="754"></A>an Athenian, who was at this time an exile, and had gained a good report 
<A NAME="755"></A>among the Medes. He declared that after the army of Xerxes had, in the 
<A NAME="756"></A>absence of the Athenians, wasted Attica, he chanced to be with Demaratus 
<A NAME="757"></A>the Lacedaemonian in the Thriasian plain, and that while there, he saw 
<A NAME="758"></A>a cloud of dust advancing from Eleusis, such as a host of thirty thousand 
<A NAME="759"></A>men might raise. As he and his companion were wondering who the men, from 
<A NAME="760"></A>whom the dust arose, could possibly be, a sound of voices reached his ear, 
<A NAME="761"></A>and he thought that he recognised the mystic hymn to Bacchus. Now Demaratus 
<A NAME="762"></A>was unacquainted with the rites of Eleusis, and so he inquired of Dicaeus 
<A NAME="763"></A>what the voices were saying. Dicaeus made answer- "O Demaratus! beyond 
<A NAME="764"></A>a doubt some mighty calamity is about to befall the king's army! For it 
<A NAME="765"></A>is manifest, inasmuch as Attica is deserted by its inhabitants, that the 
<A NAME="766"></A>sound which we have heard is an unearthly one, and is now upon its way 
<A NAME="767"></A>from Eleusis to aid the Athenians and their confederates. If it descends 
<A NAME="768"></A>upon the Peloponnese, danger will threaten the king himself and his land 
<A NAME="769"></A>army- if it moves towards the ships at Salamis, 'twill go hard but the 
<A NAME="770"></A>king's fleet there suffers destruction. Every year the Athenians celebrate 
<A NAME="771"></A>this feast to the Mother and the Daughter; and all who wish, whether they 
<A NAME="772"></A>be Athenians or any other Greeks, are initiated. The sound thou hearest 
<A NAME="773"></A>is the Bacchic song, which is wont to be sung at that festival." "Hush 
<A NAME="774"></A>now," rejoined the other; "and see thou tell no man of this matter. For 
<A NAME="775"></A>if thy words be brought to the king's ear, thou wilt assuredly lose thy 
<A NAME="776"></A>head because of them; neither I nor any man living can then save thee. 
<A NAME="777"></A>Hold thy peace therefore. The gods will see to the king's army." Thus Demaratus 
<A NAME="778"></A>counselled him; and they looked, and saw the dust, from which the sound 
<A NAME="779"></A>arose, become a cloud, and the cloud rise up into the air and sail away 
<A NAME="780"></A>to Salamis, making for the station of the Grecian fleet. Then they knew 
<A NAME="781"></A>that it was the fleet of Xerxes which would suffer destruction. Such was 
<A NAME="782"></A>the tale told by Dicaeus the son of Theocydes; and he appealed for its 
<A NAME="783"></A>truth to Demaratus and other eye-witnesses.
<A NAME="784"></A><BR><BR>The men belonging to the fleet of Xerxes, after they had seen the 
<A NAME="785"></A>Spartan dead at Thermopylae, and crossed the channel from Trachis to Histiaea, 
<A NAME="786"></A>waited there by the space of three days, and then sailing down through 
<A NAME="787"></A>the Euripus, in three more came to Phalerum. In my judgment, the Persian 
<A NAME="788"></A>forces both by land and sea when they invaded Attica were not less numerous 
<A NAME="789"></A>than they had been on their arrival at Sepias and Thermopylae. For against 
<A NAME="790"></A>the Persian loss in the storm and at Thermopylae, and again in the sea-fights 
<A NAME="791"></A>off Artemisium, I set the various nations which had since joined the king- 
<A NAME="792"></A>as the Malians, the Dorians, the Locrians, and the Boeotians- each serving 
<A NAME="793"></A>in full force in his army except the last, who did not number in their 
<A NAME="794"></A>ranks either the Thespians or the Plataeans; and together with these, the 
<A NAME="795"></A>Carystians, the Andrians, the Tenians, and the other people of the islands, 
<A NAME="796"></A>who all fought on this side except the five states already mentioned. For 
<A NAME="797"></A>as the Persians penetrated further into Greece, they were joined continually 
<A NAME="798"></A>by fresh nations.
<A NAME="799"></A><BR><BR>Reinforced by the contingents of all these various states, except 
<A NAME="800"></A>Paros, the barbarians reached Athens. As for the Parians, they tarried 
<A NAME="801"></A>at Cythnus, waiting to see how the war would go. The rest of the sea forces 
<A NAME="802"></A>came safe to Phalerum; where they were visited by Xerxes, who had conceived 
<A NAME="803"></A>a desire to go aboard and learn the wishes of the fleet. So he came and 
<A NAME="804"></A>sate in a seat of honour; and the sovereigns of the nations, and the captains 
<A NAME="805"></A>of the ships, were sent for, to appear before him, and as they arrived 
<A NAME="806"></A>took their seats according to the rank assigned them by the king. In the 
<A NAME="807"></A>first seat sate the king of Sidon; after him, the king of Tyre; then the 
<A NAME="808"></A>rest in their order. When the whole had taken their places, one after another, 
<A NAME="809"></A>and were set down in orderly array, Xerxes, to try them, sent Mardonius 
<A NAME="810"></A>and questioned each, whether a sea-fight should be risked or 
<A NAME="811"></A>no.
<A NAME="812"></A><BR><BR>Mardonius accordingly went round the entire assemblage, beginning 
<A NAME="813"></A>with the Sidonian monarch, and asked this question; to which all gave the 
<A NAME="814"></A>same answer, advising to engage the Greeks, except only Artemisia, who 
<A NAME="815"></A>spake as follows (SS 1.):-
<A NAME="816"></A><BR><BR>"Say to the king, Mardonius, that these are my words to him: I 
<A NAME="817"></A>was not the least brave of those who fought at Euboea, nor were my achievements 
<A NAME="818"></A>there among the meanest; it is my right, therefore, O my lord, to tell 
<A NAME="819"></A>thee plainly what I think to be most for thy advantage now. This then is 
<A NAME="820"></A>my advice. Spare thy ships, and do not risk a battle; for these people 
<A NAME="821"></A>are as much superior to thy people in seamanship, as men to women. What 
<A NAME="822"></A>so great need is there for thee to incur hazard at sea? Art thou not master 
<A NAME="823"></A>of Athens, for which thou didst undertake thy expedition? Is not Greece 
<A NAME="824"></A>subject to thee? Not a soul now resists thy advance. They who once resisted, 
<A NAME="825"></A>were handled even as they deserved. (SS 2.) Now learn how I expect that 
<A NAME="826"></A>affairs will go with thy adversaries. If thou art not over-hasty to engage 
<A NAME="827"></A>with them by sea, but wilt keep thy fleet near the land, then whether thou 
<A NAME="828"></A>abidest as thou art, or marchest forward towards the Peloponnese, thou 
<A NAME="829"></A>wilt easily accomplish all for which thou art come hither. The Greeks cannot 
<A NAME="830"></A>hold out against thee very long; thou wilt soon part them asunder, and 
<A NAME="831"></A>scatter them to their several homes. In the island where they lie, I hear 
<A NAME="832"></A>they have no food in store; nor is it likely, if thy land force begins 
<A NAME="833"></A>its march towards the Peloponnese, that they will remain quietly where 
<A NAME="834"></A>they are- at least such as come from that region. Of a surety they will 
<A NAME="835"></A>not greatly trouble themselves to give battle on behalf of the Athenians. 
<A NAME="836"></A>(SS 3.) On the other hand, if thou art hasty to fight, I tremble lest the 
<A NAME="837"></A>defeat of thy sea force bring harm likewise to thy land army. This, too, 
<A NAME="838"></A>thou shouldst remember, O king; good masters are apt to have bad servants, 
<A NAME="839"></A>and bad masters good ones. Now, as thou art the best of men, thy servants 
<A NAME="840"></A>must needs be a sorry set. These Egyptians, Cyprians, Cilicians, and Pamphylians, 
<A NAME="841"></A>who are counted in the number of thy subject-allies, of how little service 
<A NAME="842"></A>are they to thee!"
<A NAME="843"></A><BR><BR>As Artemisia spake, they who wished her well were greatly troubled 
<A NAME="844"></A>concerning her words, thinking that she would suffer some hurt at the king's 
<A NAME="845"></A>hands, because she exhorted him not to risk a battle; they, on the other 
<A NAME="846"></A>hand, who disliked and envied her, favoured as she was by the king above 
<A NAME="847"></A>all the rest of the allies, rejoiced at her declaration, expecting that 
<A NAME="848"></A>her life would be the forfeit. But Xerxes, when the words of the several 
<A NAME="849"></A>speakers were reported to him, was pleased beyond all others with the reply 
<A NAME="850"></A>of Artemisia; and whereas, even before this, he had always esteemed her 
<A NAME="851"></A>much, he now praised her more than ever. Nevertheless, he gave orders that 
<A NAME="852"></A>the advice of the greater number should be followed; for he thought that 
<A NAME="853"></A>at Euboea the fleet had not done its best, because he himself was not there 
<A NAME="854"></A>to see- whereas this time he resolved that he would be an eye-witness of 
<A NAME="855"></A>the combat.
<A NAME="856"></A><BR><BR>Orders were now given to stand out to sea; and the ships proceeded 
<A NAME="857"></A>towards Salamis, and took up the stations to which they were directed, 
<A NAME="858"></A>without let or hindrance from the enemy. The day, however, was too far 
<A NAME="859"></A>spent for them to begin the battle, since night already approached: so 
<A NAME="860"></A>they prepared to engage upon the morrow. The Greeks, meanwhile, were in 
<A NAME="861"></A>great distress and alarm, more especially those of the Peloponnese, who 
<A NAME="862"></A>were troubled that they had been kept at Salamis to fight on behalf of 
<A NAME="863"></A>the Athenian territory, and feared that, if they should suffer defeat, 
<A NAME="864"></A>they would be pent up and besieged in an island, while their own country 
<A NAME="865"></A>was left unprotected.
<A NAME="866"></A><BR><BR>The same night the land army of the barbarians began its march 
<A NAME="867"></A>towards the Peloponnese, where, however, all that was possible had been 
<A NAME="868"></A>done to prevent the enemy from forcing an entrance by land. As soon as 
<A NAME="869"></A>ever news reached the Peloponnese of the death of Leonidas and his companions 
<A NAME="870"></A>at Thermopylae, the inhabitants flocked together from the various cities, 
<A NAME="871"></A>and encamped at the Isthmus, under the command of Cleombrotus, son of Anaxandridas, 
<A NAME="872"></A>and brother of Leonidas. Here their first care was to block up the Scironian 
<A NAME="873"></A>Way; after which it was determined in council to build a wall across the 
<A NAME="874"></A>Isthmus. As the number assembled amounted to many tens of thousands, and 
<A NAME="875"></A>there was not one who did not give himself to the work, it was soon finished. 
<A NAME="876"></A>Stones, bricks, timber, baskets filled full of sand, were used in the building; 
<A NAME="877"></A>and not a moment was lost by those who gave their aid; for they laboured 
<A NAME="878"></A>without ceasing either by night or day.
<A NAME="879"></A><BR><BR>Now the nations who gave their aid, and who had flocked in full 
<A NAME="880"></A>force to the Isthmus, were the following: the Lacedaemonians, all the tribes 
<A NAME="881"></A>of the Arcadians, the Eleans, the Corinthians, the Sicyonians, the Epidaurians, 
<A NAME="882"></A>the Phliasians, the Troezenians, and the Hermionians. These all gave their 
<A NAME="883"></A>aid, being greatly alarmed at the danger which threatened Greece. But the 
<A NAME="884"></A>other inhabitants of the Peloponnese took no part in the matter; though 
<A NAME="885"></A>the Olympic and Carneian festivals were now over.
<A NAME="886"></A><BR><BR>Seven nations inhabit the Peloponnese. Two of them are aboriginal, 
<A NAME="887"></A>and still continue in the regions where they dwelt at the first- to wit, 
<A NAME="888"></A>the Arcadians and the Cynurians. A third, that of the Achaeans, has never 
<A NAME="889"></A>left the Peloponnese, but has been dislodged from its own proper country, 
<A NAME="890"></A>and inhabits a district which once belonged to others. The remaining nations, 
<A NAME="891"></A>four out of the seven, are all immigrants- namely, the Dorians, the Aetolians, 
<A NAME="892"></A>the Dryopians, and the Lemnians. To the Dorians belong several very famous 
<A NAME="893"></A>cities; to the Aetolians one only, that is, Elis; to the Dryopians, Hermione 
<A NAME="894"></A>and that Asine which lies over against Cardamyle in Laconia; to the Lemnians, 
<A NAME="895"></A>all the towns of the Paroreats. The aboriginal Cynurians alone seem to 
<A NAME="896"></A>be Ionians; even they, however, have, in course of time, grown to be Dorians, 
<A NAME="897"></A>under the government of the Argives, whose Orneats and vassals they were. 
<A NAME="898"></A>All the cities of these seven nations, except those mentioned above, stood 
<A NAME="899"></A>aloof from the war; and by so doing, if I may speak freely, they in fact 
<A NAME="900"></A>took part with the Medes.
<A NAME="901"></A><BR><BR>So the Greeks at the Isthmus toiled unceasingly, as though in the 
<A NAME="902"></A>greatest peril; since they never imagined that any great success would 
<A NAME="903"></A>be gained by the fleet. The Greeks at Salamis, on the other hand, when 
<A NAME="904"></A>they heard what the rest were about, felt greatly alarmed; but their fear 
<A NAME="905"></A>was not so much for themselves as for the Peloponnese. At first they conversed 
<A NAME="906"></A>together in low tones, each man with his fellow, secretly, and marvelled 
<A NAME="907"></A>at the folly shown by Eurybiades; but presently the smothered feeling broke 
<A NAME="908"></A>out, and another assembly was held; whereat the old subjects provoked much 
<A NAME="909"></A>talk from the speakers, one side maintaining that it was best to sail to 
<A NAME="910"></A>the Peloponnese and risk battle for that, instead of abiding at Salamis 
<A NAME="911"></A>and fighting for a land already taken by the enemy; while the other, which 
<A NAME="912"></A>consisted of the Athenians, Eginetans, and Megarians, was urgent to remain 
<A NAME="913"></A>and have the battle fought where they were.
<A NAME="914"></A><BR><BR>Then Themistocles, when he saw that the Peloponnesians would carry 
<A NAME="915"></A>the vote against him, went out secretly from the council, and, instructing 
<A NAME="916"></A>a certain man what he should say, sent him on board a merchant ship to 
<A NAME="917"></A>the fleet of the Medes. The man's name was Sicinnus; he was one of Themistocles' 
<A NAME="918"></A>household slaves, and acted as tutor to his sons; in after times, when 
<A NAME="919"></A>the Thespians were admitting persons to citizenship, Themistocles made 
<A NAME="920"></A>him a Thespian, and a rich man to boot. The ship brought Sicinnus to the 
<A NAME="921"></A>Persian fleet, and there he delivered his message to the leaders in these 
<A NAME="922"></A>words:-
<A NAME="923"></A><BR><BR>"The Athenian commander has sent me to you privily, without the 
<A NAME="924"></A>knowledge of the other Greeks. He is a well-wisher to the king's cause, 
<A NAME="925"></A>and would rather success should attend on you than on his countrymen; wherefore 
<A NAME="926"></A>he bids me tell you that fear has seized the Greeks and they are meditating 
<A NAME="927"></A>a hasty flight. Now then it is open to you to achieve the best work that 
<A NAME="928"></A>ever ye wrought, if only ye will hinder their escaping. They no longer 
<A NAME="929"></A>agree among themselves, so that they will not now make any resistance- 
<A NAME="930"></A>nay, 'tis likely ye may see a fight already begun between such as favour 
<A NAME="931"></A>and such as oppose your cause." The messenger, when he had thus expressed 
<A NAME="932"></A>himself, departed and was seen no more.
<A NAME="933"></A><BR><BR>Then the captains, believing all that the messenger had said, proceeded 
<A NAME="934"></A>to land a large body of Persian troops on the islet of Psyttaleia, which 
<A NAME="935"></A>lies between Salamis and the mainland; after which, about the hour of midnight, 
<A NAME="936"></A>they advanced their western wing towards Salamis, so as to inclose the 
<A NAME="937"></A>Greeks. At the same time the force stationed about Ceos and Cynosura moved 
<A NAME="938"></A>forward, and filled the whole strait as far as Munychia with their ships. 
<A NAME="939"></A>This advance was made to prevent the Greeks from escaping by flight, and 
<A NAME="940"></A>to block them up in Salamis, where it was thought that vengeance might 
<A NAME="941"></A>be taken upon them for the battles fought near Artemisium. The Persian 
<A NAME="942"></A>troops were landed on the islet of Psyttaleia, because, as soon as the 
<A NAME="943"></A>battle began, the men and wrecks were likely to be drifted thither, as 
<A NAME="944"></A>the isle lay in the very path of the coming fight- and they would thus 
<A NAME="945"></A>be able to save their own men and destroy those of the enemy. All these 
<A NAME="946"></A>movements were made in silence, that the Greeks might have no knowledge 
<A NAME="947"></A>of them; and they occupied the whole night, so that the men had no time 
<A NAME="948"></A>to get their sleep.
<A NAME="949"></A><BR><BR>I cannot say that there is no truth in prophecies, or feel inclined 
<A NAME="950"></A>to call in question those which speak with clearness, when I think of the 
<A NAME="951"></A>following:-
<A NAME="952"></A><BR><BR>When they shall bridge with their ships to the sacred strand of 
<A NAME="953"></A>Diana
<A NAME="954"></A><BR>Girt with the golden falchion, and eke to marine 
<A NAME="955"></A>Cynosura,
<A NAME="956"></A><BR>Mad hope swelling their hearts at the downfall of beautiful 
<A NAME="957"></A>Athens
<A NAME="958"></A><BR>Then shall godlike Right extinguish haughty Presumption,
<A NAME="959"></A><BR>Insult's furious offspring, who thinketh to overthrow all 
<A NAME="960"></A>things.
<A NAME="961"></A><BR>Brass with brass shall mingle, and Mars with blood shall 
<A NAME="962"></A>empurple
<A NAME="963"></A><BR>Ocean's waves. Then- then shall the day of Grecia's 
<A NAME="964"></A>freedom
<A NAME="965"></A><BR>Come from Victory fair, and Saturn's son all-seeing. When I look to 
<A NAME="966"></A>this, and perceive how clearly Bacis spoke, neither venture myself to say 
<A NAME="967"></A>anything against prophecies, nor do approve of others impugning 
<A NAME="968"></A>them.
<A NAME="969"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile, among the captains at Salamis, the strife of words grew 
<A NAME="970"></A>fierce. As yet they did not know that they were encompassed, but imagined 
<A NAME="971"></A>that the barbarians remained in the same places where they had seen them 
<A NAME="972"></A>the day before.
<A NAME="973"></A><BR><BR>In the midst of their contention, Aristides, the son of Lysimachus, 
<A NAME="974"></A>who had crossed from Egina, arrived in Salamis. He was an Athenian, and 
<A NAME="975"></A>had been ostracised by the commonalty; yet I believe, from what I have 
<A NAME="976"></A>heard concerning his character, that there was not in all Athens a man 
<A NAME="977"></A>so worthy or so just as he. He now came to the council, and, standing outside, 
<A NAME="978"></A>called for Themistocles. Now Themistocles was not his friend, but his most 
<A NAME="979"></A>determined enemy. However, under the pressure of the great dangers impending, 
<A NAME="980"></A>Aristides forgot their feud, and called Themistocles out of the council, 
<A NAME="981"></A>since he wished to confer with him. He had heard before his arrival of 
<A NAME="982"></A>the impatience of the Peloponnesians to withdraw the fleet to the Isthmus. 
<A NAME="983"></A>As soon therefore as Themistocles came forth, Aristides addressed him in 
<A NAME="984"></A>these words:-
<A NAME="985"></A><BR><BR>"Our rivalry at all times, and especially at the present season, 
<A NAME="986"></A>ought to be a struggle, which of us shall most advantage our country. Let 
<A NAME="987"></A>me then say to thee, that so far as regards the departure of the Peloponnesians 
<A NAME="988"></A>from this place, much talk and little will be found precisely alike. I 
<A NAME="989"></A>have seen with my own eyes that which I now report: that, however much 
<A NAME="990"></A>the Corinthians or Eurybiades himself may wish it, they cannot now retreat; 
<A NAME="991"></A>for we are enclosed on every side by the enemy. Go in to them, and make 
<A NAME="992"></A>this known."
<A NAME="993"></A><BR><BR>"Thy advice is excellent," answered the other; "and thy tidings 
<A NAME="994"></A>are also good. That which I earnestly desired to happen, thine eyes have 
<A NAME="995"></A>beheld accomplished. Know that what the Medes have now done was at my instance; 
<A NAME="996"></A>for it was necessary, as our men would not fight here of their own free 
<A NAME="997"></A>will, to make them fight whether they would or no. But come now, as thou 
<A NAME="998"></A>hast brought the good news, go in and tell it. For if I speak to them, 
<A NAME="999"></A>they will think it a feigned tale, and will not believe that the barbarians 
<A NAME="1000"></A>have inclosed us around. Therefore do thou go to them, and inform them 
<A NAME="1001"></A>how matters stand. If they believe thee, 'twill be for the best; but if 
<A NAME="1002"></A>otherwise, it will not harm. For it is impossible that they should now 
<A NAME="1003"></A>flee away, if we are indeed shut in on all sides, as thou 
<A NAME="1004"></A>sayest."
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR><BR>Then Aristides entered the assembly, and spoke to the captains: 
<A NAME="1006"></A>he had come, he told them, from Egina, and had but barely escaped the blockading 
<A NAME="1007"></A>vessels- the Greek fleet was entirely inclosed by the ships of Xerxes- 
<A NAME="1008"></A>and he advised them to get themselves in readiness to resist the foe. Having 
<A NAME="1009"></A>said so much, he withdrew. And now another contest arose; for the greater 
<A NAME="1010"></A>part of the captains would not believe the tidings.
<A NAME="1011"></A><BR><BR>But while they still doubted, a Tenian trireme, commanded by Panaetius 
<A NAME="1012"></A>the son of Sosimenes, deserted from the Persians and joined the Greeks, 
<A NAME="1013"></A>bringing full intelligence. For this reason the Tenians were inscribed 
<A NAME="1014"></A>upon the tripod at Delphi among those who overthrew the barbarians. With 
<A NAME="1015"></A>this ship, which deserted to their side at Salamis, and the Lemnian vessel 
<A NAME="1016"></A>which came over before at Artemisium, the Greek fleet was brought to the 
<A NAME="1017"></A>full number of 380 ships; otherwise it fell short by two of that 
<A NAME="1018"></A>amount.
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR><BR>The Greeks now, not doubting what the Tenians told them, made ready 
<A NAME="1020"></A>for the coming fight. At the dawn of day, all the men-at-arms were assembled 
<A NAME="1021"></A>together, and speeches were made to them, of which the best was that of 
<A NAME="1022"></A>Themistocles; who throughout contrasted what was noble with what was base, 
<A NAME="1023"></A>and bade them, in all that came within the range of man's nature and constitution, 
<A NAME="1024"></A>always to make choice of the nobler part. Having thus wound up his discourse, 
<A NAME="1025"></A>he told them to go at once on board their ships, which they accordingly 
<A NAME="1026"></A>did; and about his time the trireme, that had been sent to Egina for the 
<A NAME="1027"></A>Aeacidae, returned; whereupon the Greeks put to sea with all their 
<A NAME="1028"></A>fleet.
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR><BR>The fleet had scarce left the land when they were attacked by the 
<A NAME="1030"></A>barbarians. At once most of the Greeks began to back water, and were about 
<A NAME="1031"></A>touching the shore, when Ameinias of Palline, one of the Athenian captains, 
<A NAME="1032"></A>darted forth in front of the line, and charged a ship of the enemy. The 
<A NAME="1033"></A>two vessels became entangled, and could not separate, whereupon the rest 
<A NAME="1034"></A>of the fleet came up to help Ameinias, and engaged with the Persians. Such 
<A NAME="1035"></A>is the account which the Athenians give of the way in which the battle 
<A NAME="1036"></A>began; but the Eginetans maintain that the vessel which had been to Egina 
<A NAME="1037"></A>for the Aeacidae, was the one that brought on the fight. It is also reported, 
<A NAME="1038"></A>that a phantom in the form of a woman appeared to the Greeks, and, in a 
<A NAME="1039"></A>voice that was heard from end to end of the fleet, cheered them on to the 
<A NAME="1040"></A>fight; first, however, rebuking them, and saying- "Strange men, how long 
<A NAME="1041"></A>are ye going to back water?"
<A NAME="1042"></A><BR><BR>Against the Athenians, who held the western extremity of the line 
<A NAME="1043"></A>towards Eleusis, were placed the Phoenicians; against the Lacedaemonians, 
<A NAME="1044"></A>whose station was eastward towards the Piraeus, the Ionians. Of these last 
<A NAME="1045"></A>a few only followed the advice of Themistocles, to fight backwardly; the 
<A NAME="1046"></A>greater number did far otherwise. I could mention here the names of many 
<A NAME="1047"></A>trierarchs who took vessels from the Greeks, but I shall pass over all 
<A NAME="1048"></A>excepting Theomestor, the son of Androdamas, and Phylacus, the son of Histiaeus, 
<A NAME="1049"></A>both Samians. I show this preference to them, inasmuch as for this service 
<A NAME="1050"></A>Theomestor was made tyrant of Samos by the Persians, which Phylacus was 
<A NAME="1051"></A>enrolled among the king's benefactors, and presented with a large estate 
<A NAME="1052"></A>in land. In the Persian tongue the king's benefactors are called 
<A NAME="1053"></A>Orosangs.
<A NAME="1054"></A><BR><BR>Far the greater number of the Persian ships engaged in this battle 
<A NAME="1055"></A>were disabled, either by the Athenians or by the Eginetans. For as the 
<A NAME="1056"></A>Greeks fought in order and kept their line, while the barbarians were in 
<A NAME="1057"></A>confusion and had no plan in anything that they did, the issue of the battle 
<A NAME="1058"></A>could scarce be other than it was. Yet the Persians fought far more bravely 
<A NAME="1059"></A>here than at Euboea, and indeed surpassed themselves; each did his utmost 
<A NAME="1060"></A>through fear of Xerxes, for each thought that the king's eye was upon 
<A NAME="1061"></A>himself.
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR><BR>What part the several nations, whether Greek or barbarian, took 
<A NAME="1063"></A>in the combat, I am not able to say for certain; Artemisia, however, I 
<A NAME="1064"></A>know, distinguished herself in such a way as raised her even higher than 
<A NAME="1065"></A>she stood before in the esteem of the king. For after confusion had spread 
<A NAME="1066"></A>throughout the whole of the king's fleet, and her ship was closely pursued 
<A NAME="1067"></A>by an Athenian trireme, she, having no way to fly, since in front of her 
<A NAME="1068"></A>were a number of friendly vessels, and she was nearest of all the Persians 
<A NAME="1069"></A>to the enemy, resolved on a measure which in fact proved her safety. Pressed 
<A NAME="1070"></A>by the Athenian pursuer, she bore straight against one of the ships of 
<A NAME="1071"></A>her own party, a Calyndian, which had Damasithymus, the Calyndian king, 
<A NAME="1072"></A>himself on board. I cannot say whether she had had any quarrel with the 
<A NAME="1073"></A>man while the fleet was at the Hellespont, or no- neither can I decide 
<A NAME="1074"></A>whether she of set purpose attacked his vessel, or whether it merely chanced 
<A NAME="1075"></A>that the Calyndian ship came in her way- but certain it is that she bore 
<A NAME="1076"></A>down upon his vessel and sank it, and that thereby she had the good fortune 
<A NAME="1077"></A>to procure herself a double advantage. For the commander of the Athenian 
<A NAME="1078"></A>trireme, when he saw her bear down on one of the enemy's fleet, thought 
<A NAME="1079"></A>immediately that her vessel was a Greek, or else had deserted from the 
<A NAME="1080"></A>Persians, and was now fighting on the Greek side; he therefore gave up 
<A NAME="1081"></A>the chase, and turned away to attack others.
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR><BR>Thus in the first place she saved her life by the action, and was 
<A NAME="1083"></A>enabled to get clear off from the battle; while further, it fell out that 
<A NAME="1084"></A>in the very act of doing the king an injury she raised herself to a greater 
<A NAME="1085"></A>height than ever in his esteem. For as Xerxes beheld the fight, he remarked 
<A NAME="1086"></A>(it is said) the destruction of the vessel, whereupon the bystanders observed 
<A NAME="1087"></A>to him- "Seest thou, master, how well Artemisia fights, and how she has 
<A NAME="1088"></A>just sunk a ship of the enemy?" Then Xerxes asked if it were really Artemisia's 
<A NAME="1089"></A>doing; and they answered, "Certainly; for they knew her ensign": while 
<A NAME="1090"></A>all made sure that the sunken vessel belonged to the opposite side. Everything,
