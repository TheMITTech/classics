<A NAME="start"></A>
<A NAME="10"></A><B>Melpomene</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>After the taking of Babylon, an expedition was led by Darius into 
<A NAME="12"></A>Scythia. Asia abounding in men, and vast sums flowing into the treasury, 
<A NAME="13"></A>the desire seized him to exact vengeance from the Scyths, who had once 
<A NAME="14"></A>in days gone by invaded Media, defeated those who met them in the field, 
<A NAME="15"></A>and so begun the quarrel. During the space of eight-and-twenty years, as 
<A NAME="16"></A>I have before mentioned, the Scyths continued lords of the whole of Upper 
<A NAME="17"></A>Asia. They entered Asia in pursuit of the Cimmerians, and overthrew the 
<A NAME="18"></A>empire of the Medes, who till they came possessed the sovereignty. On their 
<A NAME="19"></A>return to their homes after the long absence of twenty-eight years, a task 
<A NAME="20"></A>awaited them little less troublesome than their struggle with the Medes. 
<A NAME="21"></A>They found an army of no small size prepared to oppose their entrance. 
<A NAME="22"></A>For the Scythian women, when they saw that time went on, and their husbands 
<A NAME="23"></A>did not come back, had intermarried with their slaves.
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR>Now the Scythians blind all their slaves, to use them in preparing 
<A NAME="25"></A>their milk. The plan they follow is to thrust tubes made of bone, not unlike 
<A NAME="26"></A>our musical pipes, up the vulva of the mare, and then to blow into the 
<A NAME="27"></A>tubes with their mouths, some milking while the others blow. They say that 
<A NAME="28"></A>they do this because when the veins of the animal are full of air, the 
<A NAME="29"></A>udder is forced down. The milk thus obtained is poured into deep wooden 
<A NAME="30"></A>casks, about which the blind slaves are placed, and then the milk is stirred 
<A NAME="31"></A>round. That which rises to the top is drawn off, and considered the best 
<A NAME="32"></A>part; the under portion is of less account. Such is the reason why the 
<A NAME="33"></A>Scythians blind all those whom they take in war; it arises from their not 
<A NAME="34"></A>being tillers of the ground, but a pastoral race.
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR>When therefore the children sprung from these slaves and the Scythian 
<A NAME="36"></A>women grew to manhood, and understood the circumstances of their birth, 
<A NAME="37"></A>they resolved to oppose the army which was returning from Media. And, first 
<A NAME="38"></A>of all, they cut off a tract of country from the rest of Scythia by digging 
<A NAME="39"></A>a broad dyke from the Tauric mountains to the vast lake of the Maeotis. 
<A NAME="40"></A>Afterwards, when the Scythians tried to force an entrance, they marched 
<A NAME="41"></A>out and engaged them. Many battles were fought, and the Scythians gained 
<A NAME="42"></A>no advantage, until at last one of them thus addressed the remainder: "What 
<A NAME="43"></A>are we doing, Scythians? We are fighting our slaves, diminishing our own 
<A NAME="44"></A>number when we fall, and the number of those that belong to us when they 
<A NAME="45"></A>fall by our hands. Take my advice- lay spear and bow aside, and let each 
<A NAME="46"></A>man fetch his horsewhip, and go boldly up to them. So long as they see 
<A NAME="47"></A>us with arms in our hands, they imagine themselves our equals in birth 
<A NAME="48"></A>and bravery; but let them behold us with no other weapon but the whip, 
<A NAME="49"></A>and they will feel that they are our slaves, and flee before 
<A NAME="50"></A>us."
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR>The Scythians followed this counsel, and the slaves were so astounded, 
<A NAME="52"></A>that they forgot to fight, and immediately ran away. Such was the mode 
<A NAME="53"></A>in which the Scythians, after being for a time the lords of Asia, and being 
<A NAME="54"></A>forced to quit it by the Medes, returned and settled in their own country. 
<A NAME="55"></A>This inroad of theirs it was that Darius was anxious to avenge, and such 
<A NAME="56"></A>was the purpose for which he was now collecting an army to invade 
<A NAME="57"></A>them.
<A NAME="58"></A><BR><BR>According to the account which the Scythians themselves give, they 
<A NAME="59"></A>are the youngest of all nations. Their tradition is as follows. A certain 
<A NAME="60"></A>Targitaus was the first man who ever lived in their country, which before 
<A NAME="61"></A>his time was a desert without inhabitants. He was a child- I do not believe 
<A NAME="62"></A>the tale, but it is told nevertheless- of Jove and a daughter of the Borysthenes. 
<A NAME="63"></A>Targitaus, thus descended, begat three sons, Leipoxais, Arpoxais, and Colaxais, 
<A NAME="64"></A>who was the youngest born of the three. While they still ruled the land, 
<A NAME="65"></A>there fell from the sky four implements, all of gold- a plough, a yoke, 
<A NAME="66"></A>a battle-axe, and a drinking-cup. The eldest of the brothers perceived 
<A NAME="67"></A>them first, and approached to pick them up; when lo! as he came near, the 
<A NAME="68"></A>gold took fire, and blazed. He therefore went his way, and the second coming 
<A NAME="69"></A>forward made the attempt, but the same thing happened again. The gold rejected 
<A NAME="70"></A>both the eldest and the second brother. Last of all the youngest brother 
<A NAME="71"></A>approached, and immediately the flames were extinguished; so he picked 
<A NAME="72"></A>up the gold, and carried it to his home. Then the two elder agreed together, 
<A NAME="73"></A>and made the whole kingdom over to the youngest born.
<A NAME="74"></A><BR><BR>From Leipoxais sprang the Scythians of the race called Auchatae; 
<A NAME="75"></A>from Arpoxais, the middle brother, those known as the Catiari and Traspians; 
<A NAME="76"></A>from Colaxais, the youngest, the Royal Scythians, or Paralatae. All together 
<A NAME="77"></A>they are named Scoloti, after one of their kings: the Greeks, however, 
<A NAME="78"></A>call them Scythians.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>Such is the account which the Scythians give of their origin. They 
<A NAME="80"></A>add that from the time of Targitaus, their first king, to the invasion 
<A NAME="81"></A>of their country by Darius, is a period of one thousand years, neither 
<A NAME="82"></A>less nor more. The Royal Scythians guard the sacred gold with most especial 
<A NAME="83"></A>care, and year by year offer great sacrifices in its honour. At this feast, 
<A NAME="84"></A>if the man who has the custody of the gold should fall asleep in the open 
<A NAME="85"></A>air, he is sure (the Scythians say) not to outlive the year. His pay therefore 
<A NAME="86"></A>is as much land as he can ride round on horseback in a day. As the extent 
<A NAME="87"></A>of Scythia is very great, Colaxais gave each of his three sons a separate 
<A NAME="88"></A>kingdom, one of which was of ampler size than the other two: in this the 
<A NAME="89"></A>gold was preserved. Above, to the northward of the farthest dwellers in 
<A NAME="90"></A>Scythia, the country is said to be concealed from sight and made impassable 
<A NAME="91"></A>by reason of the feathers which are shed abroad abundantly. The earth and 
<A NAME="92"></A>air are alike full of them, and this it is which prevents the eye from 
<A NAME="93"></A>obtaining any view of the region.
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR>Such is the account which the Scythians give of themselves, and 
<A NAME="95"></A>of the country which lies above them. The Greeks who dwell about the Pontus 
<A NAME="96"></A>tell a different story. According to Hercules, when he was carrying off 
<A NAME="97"></A>the cows of Geryon, arrived in the region which is now inhabited by the 
<A NAME="98"></A>Scyths, but which was then a desert. Geryon lived outside the Pontus, in 
<A NAME="99"></A>an island called by the Greeks Erytheia, near Gades, which is beyond the 
<A NAME="100"></A>Pillars of Hercules upon the Ocean. Now some say that the Ocean begins 
<A NAME="101"></A>in the east, and runs the whole way round the world; but they give no proof 
<A NAME="102"></A>that this is really so. Hercules came from thence into the region now called 
<A NAME="103"></A>Scythia, and, being overtaken by storm and frost, drew his lion's skin 
<A NAME="104"></A>about him, and fell fast asleep. While he slept, his mares, which he had 
<A NAME="105"></A>loosed from his chariot to graze, by some wonderful chance 
<A NAME="106"></A>disappeared.
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR>On waking, he went in quest of them, and, after wandering over 
<A NAME="108"></A>the whole country, came at last to the district called "the Woodland," 
<A NAME="109"></A>where he found in a cave a strange being, between a maiden and a serpent, 
<A NAME="110"></A>whose form from the waist upwards was like that of a woman, while all below 
<A NAME="111"></A>was like a snake. He looked at her wonderingly; but nevertheless inquired, 
<A NAME="112"></A>whether she had chanced to see his strayed mares anywhere. She answered 
<A NAME="113"></A>him, "Yes, and they were now in her keeping; but never would she consent 
<A NAME="114"></A>to give them back, unless he took her for his mistress." So Hercules, to 
<A NAME="115"></A>get his mares back, agreed; but afterwards she put him off and delayed 
<A NAME="116"></A>restoring the mares, since she wished to keep him with her as long as possible. 
<A NAME="117"></A>He, on the other hand, was only anxious to secure them and to get away. 
<A NAME="118"></A>At last, when she gave them up, she said to him, "When thy mares strayed 
<A NAME="119"></A>hither, it was I who saved them for thee: now thou hast paid their salvage; 
<A NAME="120"></A>for lo! I bear in my womb three sons of thine. Tell me therefore when thy 
<A NAME="121"></A>sons grow up, what must I do with them? Wouldst thou wish that I should 
<A NAME="122"></A>settle them here in this land, whereof I am mistress, or shall I send them 
<A NAME="123"></A>to thee?" Thus questioned, they say, Hercules answered, "When the lads 
<A NAME="124"></A>have grown to manhood, do thus, and assuredly thou wilt not err. Watch 
<A NAME="125"></A>them, and when thou seest one of them bend this bow as I now bend it, and 
<A NAME="126"></A>gird himself with this girdle thus, choose him to remain in the land. Those 
<A NAME="127"></A>who fail in the trial, send away. Thus wilt thou at once please thyself 
<A NAME="128"></A>and obey me."
<A NAME="129"></A><BR><BR>Hereupon he strung one of his bows- up to that time he had carried 
<A NAME="130"></A>two- and showed her how to fasten the belt. Then he gave both bow and belt 
<A NAME="131"></A>into her hands. Now the belt had a golden goblet attached to its clasp. 
<A NAME="132"></A>So after he had given them to her, he went his way; and the woman, when 
<A NAME="133"></A>her children grew to manhood, first gave them severally their names. One 
<A NAME="134"></A>she called Agathyrsus, one Gelonus, and the other, who was the youngest, 
<A NAME="135"></A>Scythes. Then she remembered the instructions she had received from Hercules, 
<A NAME="136"></A>and, in obedience to his orders, she put her sons to the test. Two of them, 
<A NAME="137"></A>Agathyrsus and Gelonus, proving unequal to the task enjoined, their mother 
<A NAME="138"></A>sent them out of the land; Scythes, the youngest, succeeded, and so he 
<A NAME="139"></A>was allowed to remain. From Scythes, the son of Hercules, were descended 
<A NAME="140"></A>the after kings of Scythia; and from the circumstance of the goblet which 
<A NAME="141"></A>hung from the belt, the Scythians to this day wear goblets at their girdles. 
<A NAME="142"></A>This was the only thing which the mother of Scythes did for him. Such is 
<A NAME="143"></A>the tale told by the Greeks who dwell around the Pontus.
<A NAME="144"></A><BR><BR>There is also another different story, now to be related, in which 
<A NAME="145"></A>I am more inclined to put faith than in any other. It is that the wandering 
<A NAME="146"></A>Scythians once dwelt in Asia, and there warred with the Massagetae, but 
<A NAME="147"></A>with ill success; they therefore quitted their homes, crossed the Araxes, 
<A NAME="148"></A>and entered the land of Cimmeria. For the land which is now inhabited by 
<A NAME="149"></A>the Scyths was formerly the country of the Cimmerians. On their coming, 
<A NAME="150"></A>the natives, who heard how numerous the invading army was, held a council. 
<A NAME="151"></A>At this meeting opinion was divided, and both parties stiffly maintained 
<A NAME="152"></A>their own view; but the counsel of the Royal tribe was the braver. For 
<A NAME="153"></A>the others urged that the best thing to be done was to leave the country, 
<A NAME="154"></A>and avoid a contest with so vast a host; but the Royal tribe advised remaining 
<A NAME="155"></A>and fighting for the soil to the last. As neither party chose to give way, 
<A NAME="156"></A>the one determined to retire without a blow and yield their lands to the 
<A NAME="157"></A>invaders; but the other, remembering the good things which they had enjoyed 
<A NAME="158"></A>in their homes, and picturing to themselves the evils which they had to 
<A NAME="159"></A>expect if they gave them up, resolved not to flee, but rather to die and 
<A NAME="160"></A>at least be buried in their fatherland. Having thus decided, they drew 
<A NAME="161"></A>apart in two bodies, the one as numerous as the other, and fought together. 
<A NAME="162"></A>All of the Royal tribe were slain, and the people buried them near the 
<A NAME="163"></A>river Tyras, where their grave is still to be seen. Then the rest of the 
<A NAME="164"></A>Cimmerians departed, and the Scythians, on their coming, took possession 
<A NAME="165"></A>of a deserted land.
<A NAME="166"></A><BR><BR>Scythia still retains traces of the Cimmerians; there are Cimmerian 
<A NAME="167"></A>castles, and a Cimmerian ferry, also a tract called Cimmeria, and a Cimmerian 
<A NAME="168"></A>Bosphorus. It appears likewise that the Cimmerians, when they fled into 
<A NAME="169"></A>Asia to escape the Scyths, made a settlement in the peninsula where the 
<A NAME="170"></A>Greek city of Sinope was afterwards built. The Scyths, it is plain, pursued 
<A NAME="171"></A>them, and missing their road, poured into Media. For the Cimmerians kept 
<A NAME="172"></A>the line which led along the sea-shore, but the Scyths in their pursuit 
<A NAME="173"></A>held the Caucasus upon their right, thus proceeding inland, and falling 
<A NAME="174"></A>upon Media. This account is one which is common both to Greeks and 
<A NAME="175"></A>barbarians.
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR>Aristeas also, son of Caystrobius, a native of Proconnesus, says 
<A NAME="177"></A>in the course of his poem that wrapt in Bacchic fury he went as far as 
<A NAME="178"></A>the Issedones. Above them dwelt the Arimaspi, men with one eye; still further, 
<A NAME="179"></A>the gold-guarding griffins; and beyond these, the Hyperboreans, who extended 
<A NAME="180"></A>to the sea. Except the Hyperboreans, all these nations, beginning with 
<A NAME="181"></A>the Arimaspi, were continually encroaching upon their neighbours. Hence 
<A NAME="182"></A>it came to pass that the Arimaspi drove the Issedonians from their country, 
<A NAME="183"></A>while the Issedonians dispossessed the Scyths; and the Scyths, pressing 
<A NAME="184"></A>upon the Cimmerians, who dwelt on the shores of the Southern Sea, forced 
<A NAME="185"></A>them to leave their land. Thus even Aristeas does not agree in his account 
<A NAME="186"></A>of this region with the Scythians.
<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR>The birthplace of Aristeas, the poet who sung of these things, 
<A NAME="188"></A>I have already mentioned. I will now relate a tale which I heard concerning 
<A NAME="189"></A>him both at Proconnesus and at Cyzicus. Aristeas, they said, who belonged 
<A NAME="190"></A>to one of the noblest families in the island, had entered one day into 
<A NAME="191"></A>a fuller's shop, when he suddenly dropt down dead. Hereupon the fuller 
<A NAME="192"></A>shut up his shop, and went to tell Aristeas' kindred what had happened. 
<A NAME="193"></A>The report of the death had just spread through the town, when a certain 
<A NAME="194"></A>Cyzicenian, lately arrived from Artaca, contradicted the rumour, affirming 
<A NAME="195"></A>that he had met Aristeas on his road to Cyzicus, and had spoken with him. 
<A NAME="196"></A>This man, therefore, strenuously denied the rumour; the relations, however, 
<A NAME="197"></A>proceeded to the fuller's shop with all things necessary for the funeral, 
<A NAME="198"></A>intending to carry the body away. But on the shop being opened, no Aristeas 
<A NAME="199"></A>was found, either dead or alive. Seven years afterwards he reappeared, 
<A NAME="200"></A>they told me, in Proconnesus, and wrote the poem called by the Greeks The 
<A NAME="201"></A>Arimaspeia, after which he disappeared a second time. This is the tale 
<A NAME="202"></A>current in the two cities above-mentioned.
<A NAME="203"></A><BR><BR>What follows I know to have happened to the Metapontines of Italy, 
<A NAME="204"></A>three hundred and forty years after the second disappearance of Aristeas, 
<A NAME="205"></A>as I collect by comparing the accounts given me at Proconnesus and Metapontum. 
<A NAME="206"></A>Aristeas then, as the Metapontines affirm, appeared to them in their own 
<A NAME="207"></A>country, and ordered them to set up an altar in honour of Apollo, and to 
<A NAME="208"></A>place near it a statue to be called that of Aristeas the Proconnesian. 
<A NAME="209"></A>"Apollo," he told them, "had come to their country once, though he had 
<A NAME="210"></A>visited no other Italiots; and he had been with Apollo at the time, not 
<A NAME="211"></A>however in his present form, but in the shape of a crow." Having said so 
<A NAME="212"></A>much, he vanished. Then the Metapontines, as they relate, sent to Delphi, 
<A NAME="213"></A>and inquired of the god in what light they were to regard the appearance 
<A NAME="214"></A>of this ghost of a man. The Pythoness, in reply, bade them attend to what 
<A NAME="215"></A>the spectre said, "for so it would go best with them." Thus advised, they 
<A NAME="216"></A>did as they had been directed: and there is now a statue bearing the name 
<A NAME="217"></A>of Aristeas, close by the image of Apollo in the market-place of Metapontum, 
<A NAME="218"></A>with bay-trees standing around it. But enough has been said concerning 
<A NAME="219"></A>Aristeas.
<A NAME="220"></A><BR><BR>With regard to the regions which lie above the country whereof 
<A NAME="221"></A>this portion of my history treats, there is no one who possesses any exact 
<A NAME="222"></A>knowledge. Not a single person can I find who professes to be acquainted 
<A NAME="223"></A>with them by actual observation. Even Aristeas, the traveller of whom I 
<A NAME="224"></A>lately spoke, does not claim- and he is writing poetry- to have reached 
<A NAME="225"></A>any farther than the Issedonians. What he relates concerning the regions 
<A NAME="226"></A>beyond is, he confesses, mere hearsay, being the account which the Issedonians 
<A NAME="227"></A>gave him of those countries. However, I shall proceed to mention all that 
<A NAME="228"></A>I have learnt of these parts by the most exact inquiries which I have been 
<A NAME="229"></A>able to make concerning them.
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR>Above the mart of the Borysthenites, which is situated in the very 
<A NAME="231"></A>centre of the whole sea-coast of Scythia, the first people who inhabit 
<A NAME="232"></A>the land are the Callipedae, a Greco-Scythic race. Next to them, as you 
<A NAME="233"></A>go inland, dwell the people called the Alazonians. These two nations in 
<A NAME="234"></A>other respects resemble the Scythians in their usages, but sow and eat 
<A NAME="235"></A>corn, also onions, garlic, lentils, and millet. Beyond the Alazonians reside 
<A NAME="236"></A>Scythian cultivators, who grow corn, not for their own use, but for sale. 
<A NAME="237"></A>Still higher up are the Neuri. Northwards of the Neuri the continent, as 
<A NAME="238"></A>far as it is known to us, is uninhabited. These are the nations along the 
<A NAME="239"></A>course of the river Hypanis, west of the Borysthenes.
<A NAME="240"></A><BR><BR>Across the Borysthenes, the first country after you leave the coast 
<A NAME="241"></A>is Hylaea (the Woodland). Above this dwell the Scythian Husbandmen, whom 
<A NAME="242"></A>the Greeks living near the Hypanis call Borysthenites, while they call 
<A NAME="243"></A>themselves Olbiopolites. These Husbandmen extend eastward a distance of 
<A NAME="244"></A>three days' journey to a river bearing the name of Panticapes, while northward 
<A NAME="245"></A>the country is theirs for eleven days' sail up the course of the Borysthenes. 
<A NAME="246"></A>Further inland there is a vast tract which is uninhabited. Above this desolate 
<A NAME="247"></A>region dwell the Cannibals, who are a people apart, much unlike the Scythians. 
<A NAME="248"></A>Above them the country becomes an utter desert; not a single tribe, so 
<A NAME="249"></A>far as we know, inhabits it.
<A NAME="250"></A><BR><BR>Crossing the Panticapes, and proceeding eastward of the Husbandmen, 
<A NAME="251"></A>we come upon the wandering Scythians, who neither plough nor sow. Their 
<A NAME="252"></A>country, and the whole of this region, except Hylaea, is quite bare of 
<A NAME="253"></A>trees. They extend towards the east a distance of fourteen' days' journey, 
<A NAME="254"></A>occupying a tract which reaches to the river Gerrhus.
<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR>On the opposite side of the Gerrhus is the Royal district, as it 
<A NAME="256"></A>is called: here dwells the largest and bravest of the Scythian tribes, 
<A NAME="257"></A>which looks upon all the other tribes in the light of slaves. Its country 
<A NAME="258"></A>reaches on the south to Taurica, on the east to the trench dug by the sons 
<A NAME="259"></A>of the blind slaves, the mart upon the Palus Maeotis, called Cremni (the 
<A NAME="260"></A>Cliffs), and in part to the river Tanais. North of the country of the Royal 
<A NAME="261"></A>Scythians are the Melanchaeni (Black-Robes), a people of quite a different 
<A NAME="262"></A>race from the Scythians. Beyond them lie marshes and a region without inhabitants, 
<A NAME="263"></A>so far as our knowledge reaches.
<A NAME="264"></A><BR><BR>When one crosses the Tanais, one is no longer in Scythia; the first 
<A NAME="265"></A>region on crossing is that of the Sauromatae, who, beginning at the upper 
<A NAME="266"></A>end of the Palus Maeotis, stretch northward a distance of fifteen days' 
<A NAME="267"></A>journey, inhabiting a country which is entirely bare of trees, whether 
<A NAME="268"></A>wild or cultivated. Above them, possessing the second region, dwell the 
<A NAME="269"></A>Budini, whose territory is thickly wooded with trees of every 
<A NAME="270"></A>kind.
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>Beyond the Budini, as one goes northward, first there is a desert, 
<A NAME="272"></A>seven days' journey across; after which, if one inclines somewhat to the 
<A NAME="273"></A>east, the Thyssagetae are reached, a numerous nation quite distinct from 
<A NAME="274"></A>any other, and living by the chase. Adjoining them, and within the limits 
<A NAME="275"></A>of the same region, are the people who bear the name of Iyrcae; they also 
<A NAME="276"></A>support themselves by hunting, which they practise in the following manner. 
<A NAME="277"></A>The hunter climbs a tree, the whole country abounding in wood, and there 
<A NAME="278"></A>sets himself in ambush; he has a dog at hand, and a horse, trained to lie 
<A NAME="279"></A>down upon its belly, and thus make itself low; the hunter keeps watch, 
<A NAME="280"></A>and when he sees his game, lets fly an arrow; then mounting his horse, 
<A NAME="281"></A>he gives the beast chase, his dog following hard all the while. Beyond 
<A NAME="282"></A>these people, a little to the east, dwells a distinct tribe of Scyths, 
<A NAME="283"></A>who revolted once from the Royal Scythians, and migrated into these 
<A NAME="284"></A>parts.
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>As far as their country, the tract of land whereof I have been 
<A NAME="286"></A>speaking is all a smooth plain, and the soil deep; beyond you enter on 
<A NAME="287"></A>a region which is rugged and stony. Passing over a great extent of this 
<A NAME="288"></A>rough country, you come to a people dwelling at the foot of lofty mountains, 
<A NAME="289"></A>who are said to be all- both men and women- bald from their birth, to have 
<A NAME="290"></A>flat noses, and very long chins. These people speak a language of their 
<A NAME="291"></A>own,. the dress which they wear is the same as the Scythian. They live 
<A NAME="292"></A>on the fruit of a certain tree, the name of which is Ponticum; in size 
<A NAME="293"></A>it is about equal to our fig-tree, and it bears a fruit like a bean, with 
<A NAME="294"></A>a stone inside. When the fruit is ripe, they strain it through cloths; 
<A NAME="295"></A>the juice which runs off is black and thick, and is called by the natives 
<A NAME="296"></A>"aschy." They lap this up with their tongues, and also mix it with milk 
<A NAME="297"></A>for a drink; while they make the lees, which are solid, into cakes, and 
<A NAME="298"></A>eat them instead of meat; for they have but few sheep in their country, 
<A NAME="299"></A>in which there is no good pasturage. Each of them dwells under a tree, 
<A NAME="300"></A>and they cover the tree in winter with a cloth of thick white felt, but 
<A NAME="301"></A>take off the covering in the summer-time. No one harms these people, for 
<A NAME="302"></A>they are looked upon as sacred- they do not even possess any warlike weapons. 
<A NAME="303"></A>When their neighbours fall out, they make up the quarrel; and when one 
<A NAME="304"></A>flies to them for refuge, he is safe from all hurt. They are called the 
<A NAME="305"></A>Argippaeans.
<A NAME="306"></A><BR><BR>Up to this point the territory of which we are speaking is very 
<A NAME="307"></A>completely explored, and all the nations between the coast and the bald-headed 
<A NAME="308"></A>men are well known to us. For some of the Scythians are accustomed to penetrate 
<A NAME="309"></A>as far, of whom inquiry may easily be made, and Greeks also go there from 
<A NAME="310"></A>the mart on the Borysthenes, and from the other marts along the Euxine. 
<A NAME="311"></A>The Scythians who make this journey communicate with the inhabitants by 
<A NAME="312"></A>means of seven interpreters and seven languages.
<A NAME="313"></A><BR><BR>Thus far, therefore, the land is known; but beyond the bald-headed 
<A NAME="314"></A>men lies a region of which no one can give any exact account. Lofty and 
<A NAME="315"></A>precipitous mountains, which are never crossed, bar further progress. The 
<A NAME="316"></A>bald men say, but it does not seem to me credible, that the people who 
<A NAME="317"></A>live in these mountains have feet like goats; and that after passing them 
<A NAME="318"></A>you find another race of men, who sleep during one half of the year. This 
<A NAME="319"></A>latter statement appears to me quite unworthy of credit. The region east 
<A NAME="320"></A>of the bald-headed men is well known to be inhabited by the Issedonians, 
<A NAME="321"></A>but the tract that lies to the north of these two nations is entirely unknown, 
<A NAME="322"></A>except by the accounts which they give of it.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR><BR>The Issedonians are said to have the following customs. When a 
<A NAME="324"></A>man's father dies, all the near relatives bring sheep to the house; which 
<A NAME="325"></A>are sacrificed, and their flesh cut in pieces, while at the same time the 
<A NAME="326"></A>dead body undergoes the like treatment. The two sorts of flesh are afterwards 
<A NAME="327"></A>mixed together, and the whole is served up at a banquet. The head of the 
<A NAME="328"></A>dead man is treated differently: it is stripped bare, cleansed, and set 
<A NAME="329"></A>in gold. It then becomes an ornament on which they pride themselves, and 
<A NAME="330"></A>is brought out year by year at the great festival which sons keep in honour 
<A NAME="331"></A>of their fathers' death, just as the Greeks keep their Genesia. In other 
<A NAME="332"></A>respects the Issedonians are reputed to be observers of justice: and it 
<A NAME="333"></A>is to be remarked that their women have equal authority with the men. Thus 
<A NAME="334"></A>our knowledge extends as far as this nation.
<A NAME="335"></A><BR><BR>The regions beyond are known only from the accounts of the Issedonians, 
<A NAME="336"></A>by whom the stories are told of the one-eyed race of men and the gold-guarding 
<A NAME="337"></A>griffins. These stories are received by the Scythians from the Issedonians, 
<A NAME="338"></A>and by them passed on to us Greeks: whence it arises that we give the one-eyed 
<A NAME="339"></A>race the Scythian name of Arimaspi, "arima" being the Scythic word for 
<A NAME="340"></A>"one," and "spu" for "the eye."
<A NAME="341"></A><BR><BR>The whole district whereof we have here discoursed has winters 
<A NAME="342"></A>of exceeding rigour. During eight months the frost is so intense that water 
<A NAME="343"></A>poured upon the ground does not form mud, but if a fire be lighted on it 
<A NAME="344"></A>mud is produced. The sea freezes, and the Cimmerian Bosphorus is frozen 
<A NAME="345"></A>over. At that season the Scythians who dwell inside the trench make warlike 
<A NAME="346"></A>expeditions upon the ice, and even drive their waggons across to the country 
<A NAME="347"></A>of the Sindians. Such is the intensity of the cold during eight months 
<A NAME="348"></A>out of the twelve; and even in the remaining four the climate is still 
<A NAME="349"></A>cool. The character of the winter likewise is unlike that of the same season 
<A NAME="350"></A>in any other country; for at that time, when the rains ought to fall in 
<A NAME="351"></A>Scythia, there is scarcely any rain worth mentioning, while in summer it 
<A NAME="352"></A>never gives over raining; and thunder, which elsewhere is frequent then, 
<A NAME="353"></A>in Scythia is unknown in that part of the year, coming only in summer, 
<A NAME="354"></A>when it is very heavy. Thunder in the winter-time is there accounted a 
<A NAME="355"></A>prodigy; as also are earthquakes, whether they happen in winter or summer. 
<A NAME="356"></A>Horses bear the winter well, cold as it is, but mules and asses are quite 
<A NAME="357"></A>unable to bear it; whereas in other countries mules and asses are found 
<A NAME="358"></A>to endure the cold, while horses, if they stand still, are 
<A NAME="359"></A>frost-bitten.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR>To me it seems that the cold may likewise be the cause which prevents 
<A NAME="361"></A>the oxen in Scythia from having horns. There is a line of Homer's in the 
<A NAME="362"></A>Odyssey which gives a support to my opinion:-
<A NAME="363"></A><BR><BR>Libya too, where horns hud quick on the foreheads of lambkins. 
<A NAME="364"></A>He means to say what is quite true, that in warm countries the horns come 
<A NAME="365"></A>early. So too in countries where the cold is severe animals either have 
<A NAME="366"></A>no horns, or grow them with difficulty- the cold being the cause in this 
<A NAME="367"></A>instance.
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR>Here I must express my wonder- additions being what my work always 
<A NAME="369"></A>from the very first affected- that in Elis, where the cold is not remarkable, 
<A NAME="370"></A>and there is nothing else to account for it, mules are never produced. 
<A NAME="371"></A>The Eleans say it is in consequence of a curse; and their habit is, when 
<A NAME="372"></A>the breeding-time comes, to take their mares into one of the adjoining 
<A NAME="373"></A>countries, and there keep them till they are in foal, when they bring them 
<A NAME="374"></A>back again into Elis.
<A NAME="375"></A><BR><BR>With respect to the feathers which are said by the Scythians to 
<A NAME="376"></A>fill the air, and to prevent persons from penetrating into the remoter 
<A NAME="377"></A>parts of the continent, even having any view of those regions, my opinion 
<A NAME="378"></A>is that in the countries above Scythia it always snows- less, of course, 
<A NAME="379"></A>in the summer than in the wintertime. Now snow when it falls looks like 
<A NAME="380"></A>feathers, as every one is aware who has seen it come down close to him. 
<A NAME="381"></A>These northern regions, therefore, are uninhabitable by reason of the severity 
<A NAME="382"></A>of the winter; and the Scythians, with their neighbours, call the snow-flakes 
<A NAME="383"></A>feathers because, I think, of the likeness which they bear to them. I have 
<A NAME="384"></A>now related what is said of the most distant parts of this continent whereof 
<A NAME="385"></A>any account is given.
<A NAME="386"></A><BR><BR>Of the Hyperboreans nothing is said either by the Scythians or 
<A NAME="387"></A>by any of the other dwellers in these regions, unless it be the Issedonians. 
<A NAME="388"></A>But in my opinion, even the Issedonians are silent concerning them; otherwise 
<A NAME="389"></A>the Scythians would have repeated their statements, as they do those concerning 
<A NAME="390"></A>the one-eyed men. Hesiod, however, mentions them, and Homer also in the 
<A NAME="391"></A>Epigoni, if that be really a work of his.
<A NAME="392"></A><BR><BR>But the persons who have by far the most to say on this subject 
<A NAME="393"></A>are the Delians. They declare that certain offerings, packed in wheaten 
<A NAME="394"></A>straw, were brought from the country of the Hyperboreans into Scythia, 
<A NAME="395"></A>and that the Scythians received them and passed them on to their neighbours 
<A NAME="396"></A>upon the west, who continued to pass them on until at last they reached 
<A NAME="397"></A>the Adriatic. From hence they were sent southward, and when they came to 
<A NAME="398"></A>Greece, were received first of all by the Dodonaeans. Thence they descended 
<A NAME="399"></A>to the Maliac Gulf, from which they were carried across into Euboea, where 
<A NAME="400"></A>the people handed them on from city to city, till they came at length to 
<A NAME="401"></A>Carystus. The Carystians took them over to Tenos, without stopping at Andros; 
<A NAME="402"></A>and the Tenians brought them finally to Delos. Such, according to their 
<A NAME="403"></A>own account, was the road by which the offerings reached the Delians. Two 
<A NAME="404"></A>damsels, they say, named Hyperoche and Laodice, brought the first offerings 
<A NAME="405"></A>from the Hyperboreans; and with them the Hyperboreans sent five men to 
<A NAME="406"></A>keep them from all harm by the way; these are the persons whom the Delians 
<A NAME="407"></A>call "Perpherees," and to whom great honours are paid at Delos. Afterwards 
<A NAME="408"></A>the Hyperboreans, when they found that their messengers did not return, 
<A NAME="409"></A>thinking it would be a grievous thing always to be liable to lose the envoys 
<A NAME="410"></A>they should send, adopted the following plan:- they wrapped their offerings 
<A NAME="411"></A>in the wheaten straw, and bearing them to their borders, charged their 
<A NAME="412"></A>neighbours to send them forward from one nation to another, which was done 
<A NAME="413"></A>accordingly, and in this way the offerings reached Delos. I myself know 
<A NAME="414"></A>of a practice like this, which obtains with the women of Thrace and Paeonia. 
<A NAME="415"></A>They in their sacrifices to the queenly Diana bring wheaten straw always 
<A NAME="416"></A>with their offerings. Of my own knowledge I can testify that this is 
<A NAME="417"></A>so.
<A NAME="418"></A><BR><BR>The damsels sent by the Hyperboreans died in Delos; and in their 
<A NAME="419"></A>honour all the Delian girls and youths are wont to cut off their hair. 
<A NAME="420"></A>The girls, before their marriage-day, cut off a curl, and twining it round 
<A NAME="421"></A>a distaff, lay it upon the grave of the strangers. This grave is on the 
<A NAME="422"></A>left as one enters the precinct of Diana, and has an olive-tree growing 
<A NAME="423"></A>on it. The youths wind some of their hair round a kind of grass, and, like 
<A NAME="424"></A>the girls, place it upon the tomb. Such are the honours paid to these damsels 
<A NAME="425"></A>by the Delians.
<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR>They add that, once before, there came to Delos by the same road 
<A NAME="427"></A>as Hyperoche and Laodice, two other virgins from the Hyperboreans, whose 
<A NAME="428"></A>names were Arge and Opis. Hyperoche and Laodice came to bring to Ilithyia 
<A NAME="429"></A>the offering which they had laid upon themselves, in acknowledgment of 
<A NAME="430"></A>their quick labours; but Arge and Opis came at the same time as the gods 
<A NAME="431"></A>of Delos,' and are honoured by the Delians in a different way. For the 
<A NAME="432"></A>Delian women make collections in these maidens' names, and invoke them 
<A NAME="433"></A>in the hymn which Olen, a Lycian, composed for them; and the rest of the 
<A NAME="434"></A>islanders, and even the Ionians, have been taught by the Delians to do 
<A NAME="435"></A>the like. This Olen, who came from Lycia, made the other old hymns also 
<A NAME="436"></A>which are sung in Delos. The Delians add that the ashes from the thigh-bones 
<A NAME="437"></A>burnt upon the altar are scattered over the tomb of Opis and Arge. Their 
<A NAME="438"></A>tomb lies behind the temple of Diana, facing the east, near the banqueting-hall 
<A NAME="439"></A>of the Ceians. Thus much then, and no more, concerning the 
<A NAME="440"></A>Hyperboreans.
<A NAME="441"></A><BR><BR>As for the tale of Abaris, who is said to have been a Hyperborean, 
<A NAME="442"></A>and to have gone with his arrow all round the world without once eating, 
<A NAME="443"></A>I shall pass it by in silence. Thus much, however, is clear: if there are 
<A NAME="444"></A>Hyperboreans, there must also be Hypernotians. For my part, I cannot but 
<A NAME="445"></A>laugh when I see numbers of persons drawing maps of the world without having 
<A NAME="446"></A>any reason to guide them; making, as they do, the ocean-stream to run all 
<A NAME="447"></A>round the earth, and the earth itself to be an exact circle, as if described 
<A NAME="448"></A>by a pair of compasses, with Europe and Asia just of the same size. The 
<A NAME="449"></A>truth in this matter I will now proceed to explain in a very few words, 
<A NAME="450"></A>making it clear what the real size of each region is, and what shape should 
<A NAME="451"></A>be given them.
<A NAME="452"></A><BR><BR>The Persians inhabit a country upon the southern or Erythraean 
<A NAME="453"></A>sea; above them, to the north, are the Medes; beyond the Medes, the Saspirians; 
<A NAME="454"></A>beyond them, the Colchians, reaching to the northern sea, into which the 
<A NAME="455"></A>Phasis empties itself. These four nations fill the whole space from one 
<A NAME="456"></A>sea to the other.
<A NAME="457"></A><BR><BR>West of these nations there project into the sea two tracts which 
<A NAME="458"></A>I will now describe; one, beginning at the river Phasis on the north, stretches 
<A NAME="459"></A>along the Euxine and the Hellespont to Sigeum in the Troas; while on the 
<A NAME="460"></A>south it reaches from the Myriandrian gulf, which adjoins Phoenicia, to 
<A NAME="461"></A>the Triopic promontory. This is one of the tracts, and is inhabited by 
<A NAME="462"></A>thirty different nations.
<A NAME="463"></A><BR><BR>The other starts from the country of the Persians, and stretches 
<A NAME="464"></A>into the Erythraean sea, containing first Persia, then Assyria, and after 
<A NAME="465"></A>Assyria, Arabia. It ends, that is to say, it is considered to end, though 
<A NAME="466"></A>it does not really come to a termination, at the Arabian gulf- the gulf 
<A NAME="467"></A>whereinto Darius conducted the canal which he made from the Nile. Between 
<A NAME="468"></A>Persia and Phoenicia lies a broad and ample tract of country, after which 
<A NAME="469"></A>the region I am describing skirts our sea, stretching from Phoenicia along 
<A NAME="470"></A>the coast of Palestine-Syria till it comes to Egypt, where it terminates. 
<A NAME="471"></A>This entire tract contains but three nations. The whole of Asia west of 
<A NAME="472"></A>the country of the Persians is comprised in these two 
<A NAME="473"></A>regions.
<A NAME="474"></A><BR><BR>Beyond the tract occupied by the Persians, Medes, Saspirians, and 
<A NAME="475"></A>Colchians, towards the east and the region of the sunrise, Asia is bounded 
<A NAME="476"></A>on the south by the Erythraean sea, and on the north by the Caspian and 
<A NAME="477"></A>the river Araxes, which flows towards the rising sun. Till you reach India 
<A NAME="478"></A>the country is peopled; but further east it is void of inhabitants, and 
<A NAME="479"></A>no one can say what sort of region it is. Such then is the shape, and such 
<A NAME="480"></A>the size of Asia.
<A NAME="481"></A><BR><BR>Libya belongs to one of the above-mentioned tracts, for it adjoins 
<A NAME="482"></A>on Egypt. In Egypt the tract is at first a narrow neck, the distance from 
<A NAME="483"></A>our sea to the Erythraean not exceeding a hundred thousand fathoms, in 
<A NAME="484"></A>other words, a thousand furlongs; but from the point where the neck ends, 
<A NAME="485"></A>the tract which bears the name of Libya is of very great 
<A NAME="486"></A>breadth.
<A NAME="487"></A><BR><BR>For my part I am astonished that men should ever have divided Libya, 
<A NAME="488"></A>Asia, and Europe as they have, for they are exceedingly unequal. Europe 
<A NAME="489"></A>extends the entire length of the other two, and for breadth will not even 
<A NAME="490"></A>(as I think) bear to be compared to them. As for Libya, we know it to be 
<A NAME="491"></A>washed on all sides by the sea, except where it is attached to Asia. This 
<A NAME="492"></A>discovery was first made by Necos, the Egyptian king, who on desisting 
<A NAME="493"></A>from the canal which he had begun between the Nile and the Arabian gulf, 
<A NAME="494"></A>sent to sea a number of ships manned by Phoenicians, with orders to make 
<A NAME="495"></A>for the Pillars of Hercules, and return to Egypt through them, and by the 
<A NAME="496"></A>Mediterranean. The Phoenicians took their departure from Egypt by way of 
<A NAME="497"></A>the Erythraean sea, and so sailed into the southern ocean. When autumn 
<A NAME="498"></A>came, they went ashore, wherever they might happen to be, and having sown 
<A NAME="499"></A>a tract of land with corn, waited until the grain was fit to cut. Having 
<A NAME="500"></A>reaped it, they again set sail; and thus it came to pass that two whole 
<A NAME="501"></A>years went by, and it was not till the third year that they doubled the 
<A NAME="502"></A>Pillars of Hercules, and made good their voyage home. On their return, 
<A NAME="503"></A>they declared- I for my part do not believe them, but perhaps others may- 
<A NAME="504"></A>that in sailing round Libya they had the sun upon their right hand. In 
<A NAME="505"></A>this way was the extent of Libya first discovered.
<A NAME="506"></A><BR><BR>Next to these Phoenicians the Carthaginians, according to their 
<A NAME="507"></A>own accounts, made the voyage. For Sataspes, son of Teaspes the Achaemenian, 
<A NAME="508"></A>did not circumnavigate Libya, though he was sent to do so; but, fearing 
<A NAME="509"></A>the length and desolateness of the journey, he turned back and left unaccomplished 
<A NAME="510"></A>the task which had been set him by his mother. This man had used violence 
<A NAME="511"></A>towards a maiden, the daughter of Zopyrus, son of Megabyzus, and King Xerxes 
<A NAME="512"></A>was about to impale him for the offence, when his mother, who was a sister 
<A NAME="513"></A>of Darius, begged him off, undertaking to punish his crime more heavily 
<A NAME="514"></A>than the king himself had designed. She would force him, she said, to sail 
<A NAME="515"></A>round Libya and return to Egypt by the Arabian gulf. Xerxes gave his consent; 
<A NAME="516"></A>and Sataspes went down to Egypt, and there got a ship and crew, with which 
<A NAME="517"></A>he set sail for the Pillars of Hercules. Having passed the Straits, he 
<A NAME="518"></A>doubled the Libyan headland, known as Cape Soloeis, and proceeded southward. 
<A NAME="519"></A>Following this course for many months over a vast stretch of sea, and finding 
<A NAME="520"></A>that more water than he had crossed still lay ever before him, he put about, 
<A NAME="521"></A>and came back to Egypt. Thence proceeding to the court, he made report 
<A NAME="522"></A>to Xerxes, that at the farthest point to which he had reached, the coast 
<A NAME="523"></A>was occupied by a dwarfish race, who wore a dress made from the palm tree. 
<A NAME="524"></A>These people, whenever he landed, left their towns and fled away to the 
<A NAME="525"></A>mountains; his men, however, did them no wrong, only entering into their 
<A NAME="526"></A>cities and taking some of their cattle. The reason why he had not sailed 
<A NAME="527"></A>quite round Libya was, he said, because the ship stopped, and would no 
<A NAME="528"></A>go any further. Xerxes, however, did not accept this account for true; 
<A NAME="529"></A>and so Sataspes, as he had failed to accomplish the task set him, was impaled 
<A NAME="530"></A>by the king's orders in accordance with the former sentence. One of his 
<A NAME="531"></A>eunuchs, on hearing of his death, ran away with a great portion of his 
<A NAME="532"></A>wealth, and reached Samos, where a certain Samian seized the whole. I know 
<A NAME="533"></A>the man's name well, but I shall willingly forget it 
<A NAME="534"></A>here.
<A NAME="535"></A><BR><BR>Of the greater part of Asia Darius was the discoverer. Wishing 
<A NAME="536"></A>to know where the Indus (which is the only river save one that produces 
<A NAME="537"></A>crocodiles) emptied itself into the sea, he sent a number of men, on whose 
<A NAME="538"></A>truthfulness he could rely, and among them Scylax of Caryanda, to sail 
<A NAME="539"></A>down the river. They started from the city of Caspatyrus, in the region 
<A NAME="540"></A>called Pactyica, and sailed down the stream in an easterly direction to 
<A NAME="541"></A>the sea. Here they turned westward, and, after a voyage of thirty months, 
<A NAME="542"></A>reached the place from which the Egyptian king, of whom I spoke above, 
<A NAME="543"></A>sent the Phoenicians to sail round Libya. After this voyage was completed, 
<A NAME="544"></A>Darius conquered the Indians, and made use of the sea in those parts. Thus 
<A NAME="545"></A>all Asia, except the eastern portion, has been found to be similarly circumstanced 
<A NAME="546"></A>with Libya.
<A NAME="547"></A><BR><BR>But the boundaries of Europe are quite unknown, and there is not 
<A NAME="548"></A>a man who can say whether any sea girds it round either on the north or 
<A NAME="549"></A>on the east, while in length it undoubtedly extends as far as both the 
<A NAME="550"></A>other two. For my part I cannot conceive why three names, and women's names 
<A NAME="551"></A>especially, should ever have been given to a tract which is in reality 
<A NAME="552"></A>one, nor why the Egyptian Nile and the Colchian Phasis (or according to 
<A NAME="553"></A>others the Maeotic Tanais and Cimmerian ferry) should have been fixed upon 
<A NAME="554"></A>for the boundary lines; nor can I even say who gave the three tracts their 
<A NAME="555"></A>names, or whence they took the epithets. According to the Greeks in general, 
<A NAME="556"></A>Libya was so called after a certain Libya, a native woman, and Asia after 
<A NAME="557"></A>the wife of Prometheus. The Lydians, however, put in a claim to the latter 
<A NAME="558"></A>name, which, they declare, was not derived from Asia the wife of Prometheus, 
<A NAME="559"></A>but from Asies, the son of Cotys, and grandson of Manes, who also gave 
<A NAME="560"></A>name to the tribe Asias at Sardis. As for Europe, no one can say whether 
<A NAME="561"></A>it is surrounded by the sea or not, neither is it known whence the name 
<A NAME="562"></A>of Europe was derived, nor who gave it name, unless we say that Europe 
<A NAME="563"></A>was so called after the Tyrian Europe, and before her time was nameless, 
<A NAME="564"></A>like the other divisions. But it is certain that Europe was an Asiatic, 
<A NAME="565"></A>and never even set foot on the land which the Greeks now call Europe, only 
<A NAME="566"></A>sailing from Phoenicia to Crete, and from Crete to Lycia. However let us 
<A NAME="567"></A>quit these matters. We shall ourselves continue to use the names which 
<A NAME="568"></A>custom sanctions.
<A NAME="569"></A><BR><BR>The Euxine sea, where Darius now went to war, has nations dwelling 
<A NAME="570"></A>around it, with the one exception of the Scythians, more unpolished than 
<A NAME="571"></A>those of any other region that we know of. For, setting aside Anacharsis 
<A NAME="572"></A>and the Scythian people, there is not within this region a single nation 
<A NAME="573"></A>which can be put forward as having any claims to wisdom, or which has produced 
<A NAME="574"></A>a single person of any high repute. The Scythians indeed have in one respect, 
<A NAME="575"></A>and that the very most important of all those that fall under man's control, 
<A NAME="576"></A>shown themselves wiser than any nation upon the face of the earth. Their 
<A NAME="577"></A>customs otherwise are not such as I admire. The one thing of which I speak 
<A NAME="578"></A>is the contrivance whereby they make it impossible for the enemy who invades 
<A NAME="579"></A>them to escape destruction, while they themselves are entirely out of his 
<A NAME="580"></A>reach, unless it please them to engage with him. Having neither cities 
<A NAME="581"></A>nor forts, and carrying their dwellings with them wherever they go; accustomed, 
<A NAME="582"></A>moreover, one and all of them, to shoot from horseback; and living not 
<A NAME="583"></A>by husbandry but on their cattle, their waggons the only houses that they 
<A NAME="584"></A>possess, how can they fail of being unconquerable, and unassailable 
<A NAME="585"></A>even?
<A NAME="586"></A><BR><BR>The nature of their country, and the rivers by which it is intersected, 
<A NAME="587"></A>greatly favour this mode of resisting attacks. For the land is level, well 
<A NAME="588"></A>watered, and abounding in pasture; while the rivers which traverse it are 
<A NAME="589"></A>almost equal in number to the canals of Egypt. Of these I shall only mention 
<A NAME="590"></A>the most famous and such as are navigable to some distance from the sea. 
<A NAME="591"></A>They are, the Ister, which has five mouths; the Tyras, the Hypanis, the 
<A NAME="592"></A>Borysthenes, the Panticapes, the Hypacyris, the Gerrhus, and the Tanais. 
<A NAME="593"></A>The courses of these streams I shall now proceed to 
<A NAME="594"></A>describe.
<A NAME="595"></A><BR><BR>The Ister is of all the rivers with which we are acquainted the 
<A NAME="596"></A>mightiest. It never varies in height, but continues at the same level summer 
<A NAME="597"></A>and winter. Counting from the west it is the first of the Scythian rivers, 
<A NAME="598"></A>and the reason of its being the greatest is that it receives the water 
<A NAME="599"></A>of several tributaries. Now the tributaries which swell its flood are the 
<A NAME="600"></A>following: first, on the side of Scythia, these five- the stream called 
<A NAME="601"></A>by the Scythians Porata, and by the Greeks Pyretus, the Tiarantus, the 
<A NAME="602"></A>Ararus, the Naparis, and the Ordessus. The first mentioned is a great stream, 
<A NAME="603"></A>and is the easternmost of the tributaries. The Tiarantus is of less volume, 
<A NAME="604"></A>and more to the west. The Ararus, Naparis, and Ordessus fall into the Ister 
<A NAME="605"></A>between these two. All the above mentioned are genuine Scythian rivers, 
<A NAME="606"></A>and go to swell the current of the Ister.
<A NAME="607"></A><BR><BR>From the country of the Agathyrsi comes down another river, the 
<A NAME="608"></A>Maris, which empties itself into the same; and from the heights of Haemus 
<A NAME="609"></A>descend with a northern course three mighty streams, the Atlas, the Auras, 
<A NAME="610"></A>and the Tibisis, and pour their waters into it. Thrace gives it three tributaries, 
<A NAME="611"></A>the Athrys, the Noes, and the Artanes, which all pass through the country 
<A NAME="612"></A>of the Crobyzian Thracians. Another tributary is furnished by Paeonia, 
<A NAME="613"></A>namely, the Scius; this river, rising near Mount Rhodope, forces its way 
<A NAME="614"></A>through the chain of Haemus, and so reaches the Ister. From Illyria comes 
<A NAME="615"></A>another stream, the Angrus, which has a course from south to north, and 
<A NAME="616"></A>after watering the Triballian plain, falls into the Brongus, which falls 
<A NAME="617"></A>into the Ister. So the Ister is augmented by these two streams, both considerable. 
<A NAME="618"></A>Besides all these, the Ister receives also the waters of the Carpis and 
<A NAME="619"></A>the Alpis, two rivers running in a northerly direction from the country 
<A NAME="620"></A>above the Umbrians. For the Ister flows through the whole extent of Europe, 
<A NAME="621"></A>rising in the country of the Celts (the most westerly of all the nations 
<A NAME="622"></A>of Europe, excepting the Cynetians), and thence running across the continent 
<A NAME="623"></A>till it reaches Scythia, whereof it washes the flanks.
<A NAME="624"></A><BR><BR>All these streams, then, and many others, add their waters to swell 
<A NAME="625"></A>the flood of the Ister, which thus increased becomes the mightiest of rivers; 
<A NAME="626"></A>for undoubtedly if we compare the stream of the Nile with the single stream 
<A NAME="627"></A>of the Ister, we must give the preference to the Nile, of which no tributary 
<A NAME="628"></A>river, nor even rivulet, augments the volume. The Ister remains at the 
<A NAME="629"></A>same level both summer and winter- owing to the following reasons, as I 
<A NAME="630"></A>believe. During the winter it runs at its natural height, or a very little 
<A NAME="631"></A>higher, because in those countries there is scarcely any rain in winter, 
<A NAME="632"></A>but constant snow. When summer comes, this snow, which is of great depth, 
<A NAME="633"></A>begins to melt, and flows into the Ister, which is swelled at that season, 
<A NAME="634"></A>not only by this cause but also by the rains, which are heavy and frequent 
<A NAME="635"></A>at that part of the year. Thus the various streams which go to form the 
<A NAME="636"></A>Ister are higher in summer than in winter, and just so much higher as the 
<A NAME="637"></A>sun's power and attraction are greater; so that these two causes counteract 
<A NAME="638"></A>each other, and the effect is to produce a balance, whereby the Ister remains 
<A NAME="639"></A>always at the same level.
<A NAME="640"></A><BR><BR>This, then, is one of the great Scythian rivers; the next to it 
<A NAME="641"></A>is the Tyras, which rises from a great lake separating Scythia from the 
<A NAME="642"></A>land of the Neuri, and runs with a southerly course to the sea. Greeks 
<A NAME="643"></A>dwell at the mouth of the river, who are called Tyritae.
<A NAME="644"></A><BR><BR>The third river is the Hypanis. This stream rises within the limits 
<A NAME="645"></A>of Scythia, and has its source in another vast lake, around which wild 
<A NAME="646"></A>white horses graze. The lake is called, properly enough, the Mother of 
<A NAME="647"></A>the Hypanis. The Hypanis, rising here, during the distance of five days' 
<A NAME="648"></A>navigation is a shallow stream, and the water sweet and pure; thence, however, 
<A NAME="649"></A>to the sea, which is a distance of four days, it is exceedingly bitter. 
<A NAME="650"></A>This change is caused by its receiving into it at that point a brook the 
<A NAME="651"></A>waters of which are so bitter that, although it is but a tiny rivulet, 
<A NAME="652"></A>it nevertheless taints the entire Hypanis, which is a large stream among 
<A NAME="653"></A>those of the second order. The source of this bitter spring is on the borders 
<A NAME="654"></A>of the Scythian Husbandmen, where they adjoin upon the Alazonians; and 
<A NAME="655"></A>the place where it rises is called in the Scythic tongue Exampaeus, which 
<A NAME="656"></A>means in our language, "The Sacred Ways." The spring itself bears the same 
<A NAME="657"></A>name. The Tyras and the Hypanis approach each other in the country of the 
<A NAME="658"></A>Alazonians, but afterwards separate, and leave a wide space between their 
<A NAME="659"></A>streams.
<A NAME="660"></A><BR><BR>The fourth of the Scythian rivers is the Borysthenes. Next to the 
<A NAME="661"></A>Ister, it is the greatest of them all; and, in my judgment, it is the most 
<A NAME="662"></A>productive river, not merely in Scythia, but in the whole world, excepting 
<A NAME="663"></A>only the Nile, with which no stream can possibly compare. It has upon its 
<A NAME="664"></A>banks the loveliest and most excellent pasturages for cattle; it contains 
<A NAME="665"></A>abundance of the most delicious fish; its water is most pleasant to the 
<A NAME="666"></A>taste; its stream is limpid, while all the other rivers near it are muddy; 
<A NAME="667"></A>the richest harvests spring up along its course, and where the ground is 
<A NAME="668"></A>not sown, the heaviest crops of grass; while salt forms in great plenty 
<A NAME="669"></A>about its mouth without human aid, and large fish are taken in it of the 
<A NAME="670"></A>sort called Antacaei, without any prickly bones, and good for pickling. 
<A NAME="671"></A>Nor are these the whole of its marvels. As far inland as the place named 
<A NAME="672"></A>Gerrhus, which is distant forty days' voyage from the sea, its course is 
<A NAME="673"></A>known, and its direction is from north to south; but above this no one 
<A NAME="674"></A>has traced it, so as to say through what countries it flows. It enters 
<A NAME="675"></A>the territory of the Scythian Husbandmen after running for some time across 
<A NAME="676"></A>a desert region, and continues for ten days' navigation to pass through 
<A NAME="677"></A>the land which they inhabit. It is the only river besides the Nile the 
<A NAME="678"></A>sources of which are unknown to me, as they are also (I believe) to all 
<A NAME="679"></A>the other Greeks. Not long before it reaches the sea, the Borysthenes is 
<A NAME="680"></A>joined by the Hypanis, which pours its waters into the same lake. The land 
<A NAME="681"></A>that lies between them, a narrow point like the beak of a ship, is called 
<A NAME="682"></A>Cape Hippolaus. Here is a temple dedicated to Ceres, and opposite the temple 
<A NAME="683"></A>upon the Hypanis is the dwelling-place of the Borysthenites. But enough 
<A NAME="684"></A>has been said of these streams.
<A NAME="685"></A><BR><BR>Next in succession comes the fifth river, called the Panticapes, 
<A NAME="686"></A>which has, like the Borysthenes, a course from north to south, and rises 
<A NAME="687"></A>from a lake. The space between this river and the Borysthenes is occupied 
<A NAME="688"></A>by the Scythians who are engaged in husbandry. After watering their country, 
<A NAME="689"></A>the Panticapes flows through Hylaea, and empties itself into the 
<A NAME="690"></A>Borysthenes.
<A NAME="691"></A><BR><BR>The sixth stream is the Hypacyris, a river rising from a lake, 
<A NAME="692"></A>and running directly through the middle of the Nomadic Scythians. It falls 
<A NAME="693"></A>into the sea near the city of Carcinitis, leaving Hylaea and the course 
<A NAME="694"></A>of Achilles to the right.
<A NAME="695"></A><BR><BR>The seventh river is the Gerrhus, which is a branch thrown out 
<A NAME="696"></A>by the Borysthenes at the point where the course of that stream first begins 
<A NAME="697"></A>to be known, to wit, the region called by the same name as the stream itself, 
<A NAME="698"></A>viz. Gerrhus. This river on its passage towards the sea divides the country 
<A NAME="699"></A>of the Nomadic from that of the Royal Scyths. It runs into the 
<A NAME="700"></A>Hypacyris.
<A NAME="701"></A><BR><BR>The eighth river is the Tanais, a stream which has its source, 
<A NAME="702"></A>far up the country, in a lake of vast size, and which empties itself into 
<A NAME="703"></A>another still larger lake, the Palus Maeotis, whereby the country of the 
<A NAME="704"></A>Royal Scythians is divided from that of the Sauromatae. The Tanais receives 
<A NAME="705"></A>the waters of a tributary stream, called the Hyrgis.
<A NAME="706"></A><BR><BR>Such then are the rivers of chief note in Scythia. The grass which 
<A NAME="707"></A>the land produces is more apt to generate gall in the beasts that feed 
<A NAME="708"></A>on it than any other grass which is known to us, as plainly appears on 
<A NAME="709"></A>the opening of their carcases.
<A NAME="710"></A><BR><BR>Thus abundantly are the Scythians provided with the most important 
<A NAME="711"></A>necessaries. Their manners and customs come now to be described. They worship 
<A NAME="712"></A>only the following gods, namely, Vesta, whom they reverence beyond all 
<A NAME="713"></A>the rest, Jupiter, and Tellus, whom they consider to be the wife of Jupiter; 
<A NAME="714"></A>and after these Apollo, Celestial Venus, Hercules, and Mars. These gods 
<A NAME="715"></A>are worshipped by the whole nation: the Royal Scythians offer sacrifice 
<A NAME="716"></A>likewise to Neptune. In the Scythic tongue Vesta is called Tabiti, Jupiter 
<A NAME="717"></A>(very properly, in my judgment) Papaeus, Tellus Apia, Apollo Oetosyrus, 
<A NAME="718"></A>Celestial Venus Artimpasa, and Neptune Thamimasadas. They use no images, 
<A NAME="719"></A>altars, or temples, except in the worship of Mars; but in his worship they 
<A NAME="720"></A>do use them.
<A NAME="721"></A><BR><BR>The manner of their sacrifices is everywhere and in every case 
<A NAME="722"></A>the same; the victim stands with its two fore-feet bound together by a 
<A NAME="723"></A>cord, and the person who is about to offer, taking his station behind the 
<A NAME="724"></A>victim, gives the rope a pull, and thereby throws the animal down; as it 
<A NAME="725"></A>falls he invokes the god to whom he is offering; after which he puts a 
<A NAME="726"></A>noose round the animal's neck, and, inserting a small stick, twists it 
<A NAME="727"></A>round, and so strangles him. No fire is lighted, there is no consecration, 
<A NAME="728"></A>and no pouring out of drink-offerings; but directly that the beast is strangled 
<A NAME="729"></A>the sacrificer flays him, and then sets to work to boil the 
<A NAME="730"></A>flesh.
<A NAME="731"></A><BR><BR>As Scythia, however, is utterly barren of firewood, a plan has 
<A NAME="732"></A>had to be contrived for boiling the flesh, which is the following. After 
<A NAME="733"></A>flaying the beasts, they take out all the bones, and (if they possess such 
<A NAME="734"></A>gear) put the flesh into boilers made in the country, which are very like 
<A NAME="735"></A>the cauldrons of the Lesbians, except that they are of a much larger size; 
<A NAME="736"></A>then placing the bones of the animals beneath the cauldron, they set them 
<A NAME="737"></A>alight, and so boil the meat. If they do not happen to possess a cauldron, 
<A NAME="738"></A>they make the animal's paunch hold the flesh, and pouring in at the same 
<A NAME="739"></A>time a little water, lay the bones under and light them. The bones burn 
<A NAME="740"></A>beautifully; and the paunch easily contains all the flesh when it is stript 
<A NAME="741"></A>from the bones, so that by this plan your ox is made to boil himself, and 
<A NAME="742"></A>other victims also to do the like. When the meat is all cooked, the sacrificer 
<A NAME="743"></A>offers a portion of the flesh and of the entrails, by casting it on the 
<A NAME="744"></A>ground before him. They sacrifice all sorts of cattle, but most commonly 
<A NAME="745"></A>horses.
<A NAME="746"></A><BR><BR>Such are the victims offered to the other gods, and such is the 
<A NAME="747"></A>mode in which they are sacrificed; but the rites paid to Mars are different. 
<A NAME="748"></A>In every district, at the seat of government, there stands a temple of 
<A NAME="749"></A>this god, whereof the following is a description. It is a pile of brushwood, 
<A NAME="750"></A>made of a vast quantity of fagots, in length and breadth three furlongs; 
<A NAME="751"></A>in height somewhat less, having a square platform upon the top, three sides 
<A NAME="752"></A>of which are precipitous, while the fourth slopes so that men may walk 
<A NAME="753"></A>up it. Each year a hundred and fifty waggon-loads of brushwood are added 
<A NAME="754"></A>to the pile, which sinks continually by reason of the rains. An antique 
<A NAME="755"></A>iron sword is planted on the top of every such mound, and serves as the 
<A NAME="756"></A>image of Mars: yearly sacrifices of cattle and of horses are made to it, 
<A NAME="757"></A>and more victims are offered thus than to all the rest of their gods. When 
<A NAME="758"></A>prisoners are taken in war, out of every hundred men they sacrifice one, 
<A NAME="759"></A>not however with the same rites as the cattle, but with different. Libations 
<A NAME="760"></A>of wine are first poured upon their heads, after which they are slaughtered 
<A NAME="761"></A>over a vessel; the vessel is then carried up to the top of the pile, and 
<A NAME="762"></A>the blood poured upon the scymitar. While this takes place at the top of 
<A NAME="763"></A>the mound, below, by the side of the temple, the right hands and arms of 
<A NAME="764"></A>the slaughtered prisoners are cut off, and tossed on high into the air. 
<A NAME="765"></A>Then the other victims are slain, and those who have offered the sacrifice 
<A NAME="766"></A>depart, leaving the hands and arms where they may chance to have fallen, 
<A NAME="767"></A>and the bodies also, separate.
<A NAME="768"></A><BR><BR>Such are the observances of the Scythians with respect to sacrifice. 
<A NAME="769"></A>They never use swine for the purpose, nor indeed is it their wont to breed 
<A NAME="770"></A>them in any part of their country.
<A NAME="771"></A><BR><BR>In what concerns war, their customs are the following. The Scythian 
<A NAME="772"></A>soldier drinks the blood of the first man he overthrows in battle. Whatever 
<A NAME="773"></A>number he slays, he cuts off all their heads, and carries them to the king; 
<A NAME="774"></A>since he is thus entitled to a share of the booty, whereto he forfeits 
<A NAME="775"></A>all claim if he does not produce a head. In order to strip the skull of 
<A NAME="776"></A>its covering, he makes a cut round the head above the ears, and, laying 
<A NAME="777"></A>hold of the scalp, shakes the skull out; then with the rib of an ox he 
<A NAME="778"></A>scrapes the scalp clean of flesh, and softening it by rubbing between the 
<A NAME="779"></A>hands, uses it thenceforth as a napkin. The Scyth is proud of these scalps, 
<A NAME="780"></A>and hangs them from his bridle-rein; the greater the number of such napkins 
<A NAME="781"></A>that a man can show, the more highly is he esteemed among them. Many make 
<A NAME="782"></A>themselves cloaks, like the capotes of our peasants, by sewing a quantity 
<A NAME="783"></A>of these scalps together. Others flay the right arms of their dead enemies, 
<A NAME="784"></A>and make of the skin, which stripped off with the nails hanging to it, 
<A NAME="785"></A>a covering for their quivers. Now the skin of a man is thick and glossy, 
<A NAME="786"></A>and would in whiteness surpass almost all other hides. Some even flay the 
<A NAME="787"></A>entire body of their enemy, and stretching it upon a frame carry it about 
<A NAME="788"></A>with them wherever they ride. Such are the Scythian customs with respect 
<A NAME="789"></A>to scalps and skins.
<A NAME="790"></A><BR><BR>The skulls of their enemies, not indeed of all, but of those whom 
<A NAME="791"></A>they most detest, they treat as follows. Having sawn off the portion below 
<A NAME="792"></A>the eyebrows, and cleaned out the inside, they cover the outside with leather. 
<A NAME="793"></A>When a man is poor, this is all that he does; but if he is rich, he also 
<A NAME="794"></A>lines the inside with gold: in either case the skull is used as a drinking-cup. 
<A NAME="795"></A>They do the same with the skulls of their own kith and kin if they have 
<A NAME="796"></A>been at feud with them, and have vanquished them in the presence of the 
<A NAME="797"></A>king. When strangers whom they deem of any account come to visit them, 
<A NAME="798"></A>these skulls are handed round, and the host tells how that these were his 
<A NAME="799"></A>relations who made war upon him, and how that he got the better of them; 
<A NAME="800"></A>all this being looked upon as proof of bravery.
<A NAME="801"></A><BR><BR>Once a year the governor of each district, at a set place in his 
<A NAME="802"></A>own province, mingles a bowl of wine, of which all Scythians have a right 
<A NAME="803"></A>to drink by whom foes have been slain; while they who have slain no enemy 
<A NAME="804"></A>are not allowed to taste of the bowl, but sit aloof in disgrace. No greater 
<A NAME="805"></A>shame than this can happen to them. Such as have slain a very large number 
<A NAME="806"></A>of foes, have two cups instead of one, and drink from 
<A NAME="807"></A>both.
<A NAME="808"></A><BR><BR>Scythia has an abundance of soothsayers, who foretell the future 
<A NAME="809"></A>by means of a number of willow wands. A large bundle of these wands is 
<A NAME="810"></A>brought and laid on the ground. The soothsayer unties the bundle, and places 
<A NAME="811"></A>each wand by itself, at the same time uttering his prophecy: then, while 
<A NAME="812"></A>he is still speaking, he gathers the rods together again, and makes them 
<A NAME="813"></A>up once more into a bundle. This mode of divination is of home growth in 
<A NAME="814"></A>Scythia. The Enarees, or woman-like men, have another method, which they 
<A NAME="815"></A>say Venus taught them. It is done with the inner bark of the linden-tree. 
<A NAME="816"></A>They take a piece of this bark, and, splitting it into three strips, keep 
<A NAME="817"></A>twining the strips about their fingers, and untwining them, while they 
<A NAME="818"></A>prophesy.
<A NAME="819"></A><BR><BR>Whenever the Scythian king falls sick, he sends for the three soothsayers 
<A NAME="820"></A>of most renown at the time, who come and make trial of their art in the 
<A NAME="821"></A>mode above described. Generally they say that the king is ill because such 
<A NAME="822"></A>or such a person, mentioning his name, has sworn falsely by the royal hearth. 
<A NAME="823"></A>This is the usual oath among the Scythians, when they wish to swear with 
<A NAME="824"></A>very great solemnity. Then the man accused of having foresworn himself 
<A NAME="825"></A>is arrested and brought before the king. The soothsayers tell him that 
<A NAME="826"></A>by their art it is clear he has sworn a false oath by the royal hearth, 
<A NAME="827"></A>and so caused the illness of the king- he denies the charge, protests that 
<A NAME="828"></A>he has sworn no false oath, and loudly complains of the wrong done to him. 
<A NAME="829"></A>Upon this the king sends for six new soothsayers, who try the matter by 
<A NAME="830"></A>soothsaying. If they too find the man guilty of the offence, straightway 
<A NAME="831"></A>he is beheaded by those who first accused him, and his goods are parted 
<A NAME="832"></A>among them: if, on the contrary, they acquit him, other soothsayers, and 
<A NAME="833"></A>again others, are sent for, to try the case. Should the greater number 
<A NAME="834"></A>decide in favour of the man's innocence, then they who first accused him 
<A NAME="835"></A>forfeit their lives.
<A NAME="836"></A><BR><BR>The mode of their execution is the following: a waggon is loaded 
<A NAME="837"></A>with brushwood, and oxen are harnessed to it; the soothsayers, with their 
<A NAME="838"></A>feet tied together, their hands bound behind their backs, and their mouths 
<A NAME="839"></A>gagged, are thrust into the midst of the brushwood; finally the wood is 
<A NAME="840"></A>set alight, and the oxen, being startled, are made to rush off with the 
<A NAME="841"></A>waggon. It often happens that the oxen and the soothsayers are both consumed 
<A NAME="842"></A>together, but sometimes the pole of the waggon is burnt through, and the 
<A NAME="843"></A>oxen escape with a scorching. Diviners- lying diviners, they call them- 
<A NAME="844"></A>are burnt in the way described, for other causes besides the one here spoken 
<A NAME="845"></A>of. When the king puts one of them to death, he takes care not to let any 
<A NAME="846"></A>of his sons survive: all the male offspring are slain with the father, 
<A NAME="847"></A>only the females being allowed to live.
<A NAME="848"></A><BR><BR>Oaths among the Scyths are accompanied with the following ceremonies: 
<A NAME="849"></A>a large earthern bowl is filled with wine, and the parties to the oath, 
<A NAME="850"></A>wounding themselves slightly with a knife or an awl, drop some of their 
<A NAME="851"></A>blood into the wine; then they plunge into the mixture a scymitar, some 
<A NAME="852"></A>arrows, a battle-axe, and a javelin, all the while repeating prayers; lastly 
<A NAME="853"></A>the two contracting parties drink each a draught from the bowl, as do also 
<A NAME="854"></A>the chief men among their followers.
<A NAME="855"></A><BR><BR>The tombs of their kings are in the land of the Gerrhi, who dwell 
<A NAME="856"></A>at the point where the Borysthenes is first navigable. Here, when the king 
<A NAME="857"></A>dies, they dig a grave, which is square in shape, and of great size. When 
<A NAME="858"></A>it is ready, they take the king's corpse, and, having opened the belly, 
<A NAME="859"></A>and cleaned out the inside, fill the cavity with a preparation of chopped 
<A NAME="860"></A>cypress, frankincense, parsley-seed, and anise-seed, after which they sew 
<A NAME="861"></A>up the opening, enclose the body in wax, and, placing it on a waggon, carry 
<A NAME="862"></A>it about through all the different tribes. On this procession each tribe, 
<A NAME="863"></A>when it receives the corpse, imitates the example which is first set by 
<A NAME="864"></A>the Royal Scythians; every man chops off a piece of his ear, crops his 
<A NAME="865"></A>hair close, and makes a cut all round his arm, lacerates his forehead and 
<A NAME="866"></A>his nose, and thrusts an arrow through his left hand. Then they who have 
<A NAME="867"></A>the care of the corpse carry it with them to another of the tribes which 
<A NAME="868"></A>are under the Scythian rule, followed by those whom they first visited. 
<A NAME="869"></A>On completing the circuit of all the tribes under their sway, they find 
<A NAME="870"></A>themselves in the country of the Gerrhi, who are the most remote of all, 
<A NAME="871"></A>and so they come to the tombs of the kings. There the body of the dead 
<A NAME="872"></A>king is laid in the grave prepared for it, stretched upon a mattress; spears 
<A NAME="873"></A>are fixed in the ground on either side of the corpse, and beams stretched 
<A NAME="874"></A>across above it to form a roof, which is covered with a thatching of osier 
<A NAME="875"></A>twigs. In the open space around the body of the king they bury one of his 
<A NAME="876"></A>concubines, first killing her by strangling, and also his cup-bearer, his 
<A NAME="877"></A>cook, his groom, his lacquey, his messenger, some of his horses, firstlings 
<A NAME="878"></A>of all his other possessions, and some golden cups; for they use neither 
<A NAME="879"></A>silver nor brass. After this they set to work, and raise a vast mound above 
<A NAME="880"></A>the grave, all of them vying with each other and seeking to make it as 
<A NAME="881"></A>tall as possible.
<A NAME="882"></A><BR><BR>When a year is gone by, further ceremonies take place. Fifty of 
<A NAME="883"></A>the best of the late king's attendants are taken, all native Scythians- 
<A NAME="884"></A>for, as bought slaves are unknown in the country, the Scythian kings choose 
<A NAME="885"></A>any of their subjects that they like, to wait on them- fifty of these are 
<A NAME="886"></A>taken and strangled, with fifty of the most beautiful horses. When they 
<A NAME="887"></A>are dead, their bowels are taken out, and the cavity cleaned, filled full 
<A NAME="888"></A>of chaff, and straightway sewn up again. This done, a number of posts are 
<A NAME="889"></A>driven into the ground, in sets of two pairs each, and on every pair half 
<A NAME="890"></A>the felly of a wheel is placed archwise; then strong stakes are run lengthways 
<A NAME="891"></A>through the bodies of the horses from tail to neck, and they are mounted 
<A NAME="892"></A>up upon the fellies, so that the felly in front supports the shoulders 
<A NAME="893"></A>of the horse, while that behind sustains the belly and quarters, the legs 
<A NAME="894"></A>dangling in mid-air; each horse is furnished with a bit and bridle, which 
<A NAME="895"></A>latter is stretched out in front of the horse, and fastened to a peg. The 
<A NAME="896"></A>fifty strangled youths are then mounted severally on the fifty horses. 
<A NAME="897"></A>To effect this, a second stake is passed through their bodies along the 
<A NAME="898"></A>course of the spine to the neck; the lower end of which projects from the 
<A NAME="899"></A>body, and is fixed into a socket, made in the stake that runs lengthwise 
<A NAME="900"></A>down the horse. The fifty riders are thus ranged in a circle round the 
<A NAME="901"></A>tomb, and so left.
<A NAME="902"></A><BR><BR>Such, then, is the mode in which the kings are buried: as for the 
<A NAME="903"></A>people, when any one dies, his nearest of kin lay him upon a waggon and 
<A NAME="904"></A>take him round to all his friends in succession: each receives them in 
<A NAME="905"></A>turn and entertains them with a banquet, whereat the dead man is served 
<A NAME="906"></A>with a portion of all that is set before the others; this is done for forty 
<A NAME="907"></A>days, at the end of which time the burial takes place. After the burial, 
<A NAME="908"></A>those engaged in it have to purify themselves, which they do in the following 
<A NAME="909"></A>way. First they well soap and wash their heads; then, in order to cleanse 
<A NAME="910"></A>their bodies, they act as follows: they make a booth by fixing in the ground 
<A NAME="911"></A>three sticks inclined towards one another, and stretching around them woollen 
<A NAME="912"></A>felts, which they arrange so as to fit as close as possible: inside the 
<A NAME="913"></A>booth a dish is placed upon the ground, into which they put a number of 
<A NAME="914"></A>red-hot stones, and then add some hemp-seed.
<A NAME="915"></A><BR><BR>Hemp grows in Scythia: it is very like flax; only that it is a 
<A NAME="916"></A>much coarser and taller plant: some grows wild about the country, some 
<A NAME="917"></A>is produced by cultivation: the Thracians make garments of it which closely 
<A NAME="918"></A>resemble linen; so much so, indeed, that if a person has never seen hemp 
<A NAME="919"></A>he is sure to think they are linen, and if he has, unless he is very experienced 
<A NAME="920"></A>in such matters, he will not know of which material they 
<A NAME="921"></A>are.
<A NAME="922"></A><BR><BR>The Scythians, as I said, take some of this hemp-seed, and, creeping 
<A NAME="923"></A>under the felt coverings, throw it upon the red-hot stones; immediately 
<A NAME="924"></A>it smokes, and gives out such a vapour as no Grecian vapour-bath can exceed; 
<A NAME="925"></A>the Scyths, delighted, shout for joy, and this vapour serves them instead 
<A NAME="926"></A>of a water-bath; for they never by any chance wash their bodies with water. 
<A NAME="927"></A>Their women make a mixture of cypress, cedar, and frankincense wood, which 
<A NAME="928"></A>they pound into a paste upon a rough piece of stone, adding a little water 
<A NAME="929"></A>to it. With this substance, which is of a thick consistency, they plaster 
<A NAME="930"></A>their faces all over, and indeed their whole bodies. A sweet odour is thereby 
<A NAME="931"></A>imparted to them, and when they take off the plaster on the day following, 
<A NAME="932"></A>their skin is clean and glossy.
<A NAME="933"></A><BR><BR>The Scythians have an extreme hatred of all foreign customs, particularly 
<A NAME="934"></A>of those in use among the Greeks, as the instances of Anacharsis, and, 
<A NAME="935"></A>more lately, of Scylas, have fully shown. The former, after he had travelled 
<A NAME="936"></A>over a great portion of the world, and displayed wherever he went many 
<A NAME="937"></A>proofs of wisdom, as he sailed through the Hellespont on his return to 
<A NAME="938"></A>Scythia touched at Cyzicus. There he found the inhabitants celebrating 
<A NAME="939"></A>with much pomp and magnificence a festival to the Mother of the Gods, and 
<A NAME="940"></A>was himself induced to make a vow to the goddess, whereby he engaged, if 
<A NAME="941"></A>he got back safe and sound to his home, that he would give her a festival 
<A NAME="942"></A>and a night-procession in all respects like those which he had seen in 
<A NAME="943"></A>Cyzicus. When, therefore, he arrived in Scythia, he betook himself to the 
<A NAME="944"></A>district called the Woodland, which lies opposite the course of Achilles, 
<A NAME="945"></A>and is covered with trees of all manner of different kinds, and there went 
<A NAME="946"></A>through all the sacred rites with the tabour in his hand, and the images 
<A NAME="947"></A>tied to him. While thus employed, he was noticed by one of the Scythians, 
<A NAME="948"></A>who went and told king Saulius what he had seen. Then king Saulius came 
<A NAME="949"></A>in person, and when he perceived what Anacharsis was about, he shot at 
<A NAME="950"></A>him with an arrow and killed him. To this day, if you ask the Scyths about 
<A NAME="951"></A>Anacharsis, they pretend ignorance of him, because of his Grecian travels 
<A NAME="952"></A>and adoption of the customs of foreigners. I learnt, however, from Timnes, 
<A NAME="953"></A>the steward of Ariapithes, that Anacharsis was paternal uncle to the Scythian 
<A NAME="954"></A>king Idanthyrsus, being the son of Gnurus, who was the son of Lycus and 
<A NAME="955"></A>the grandson of Spargapithes. If Anacharsis were really of this house, 
<A NAME="956"></A>it must have been by his own brother that he was slain, for Idanthyrsus 
<A NAME="957"></A>was a son of the Saulius who put Anacharsis to death.
<A NAME="958"></A><BR><BR>I have heard, however, another tale, very different from this, 
<A NAME="959"></A>which is told by the Peloponnesians: they say, that Anacharsis was sent 
<A NAME="960"></A>by the king of the Scyths to make acquaintance with Greece- that he went, 
<A NAME="961"></A>and on his return home reported that the Greeks were all occupied in the 
<A NAME="962"></A>pursuit of every kind of knowledge, except the Lacedaemonians; who, however, 
<A NAME="963"></A>alone knew how to converse sensibly. A silly tale this, which the Greeks 
<A NAME="964"></A>have invented for their amusement! There is no doubt that Anacharsis suffered 
<A NAME="965"></A>death in the mode already related, on account of his attachment to foreign 
<A NAME="966"></A>customs, and the intercourse which he held with the 
<A NAME="967"></A>Greeks.
<A NAME="968"></A><BR><BR>Scylas, likewise, the son of Ariapithes, many years later, met 
<A NAME="969"></A>with almost the very same fate. Ariapithes, the Scythian king, had several 
<A NAME="970"></A>sons, among them this Scylas, who was the child, not of a native Scyth, 
<A NAME="971"></A>but of a woman of Istria. Bred up by her, Scylas gained an acquaintance 
<A NAME="972"></A>with the Greek language and letters. Some time afterwards, Ariapithes was 
<A NAME="973"></A>treacherously slain by Spargapithes, king of the Agathyrsi; whereupon Scylas 
<A NAME="974"></A>succeeded to the throne, and married one of his father's wives, a woman 
<A NAME="975"></A>named Opoea. This Opoea was a Scythian by birth, and had brought Ariapithes 
<A NAME="976"></A>a son called Oricus. Now when Scylas found himself king of Scythia, as 
<A NAME="977"></A>he disliked the Scythic mode of life, and was attached, by his bringing 
<A NAME="978"></A>up, to the manners of the Greeks, he made it his usual practice, whenever 
<A NAME="979"></A>he came with his army to the town of the Borysthenites, who, according 
<A NAME="980"></A>to their own account, are colonists of the Milesians- he made it his practice, 
<A NAME="981"></A>I say, to leave the army before the city, and, having entered within the 
<A NAME="982"></A>walls by himself, and carefully closed the gates, to exchange his Scythian 
<A NAME="983"></A>dress for Grecian garments, and in this attire to walk about the forum, 
<A NAME="984"></A>without guards or retinue. The Borysthenites kept watch at the gates, that 
<A NAME="985"></A>no Scythian might see the king thus apparelled. Scylas, meanwhile, lived 
<A NAME="986"></A>exactly as the Greeks, and even offered sacrifices to the gods according 
<A NAME="987"></A>to the Grecian rites. In this way he would pass a month, or more, with 
<A NAME="988"></A>the Borysthenites, after which he would clothe himself again in his Scythian 
<A NAME="989"></A>dress, and so take his departure. This he did repeatedly, and even built 
<A NAME="990"></A>himself a house in Borysthenes, and married a wife there who was a native 
<A NAME="991"></A>of the place.
<A NAME="992"></A><BR><BR>But when the time came that was ordained to bring him woe, the 
<A NAME="993"></A>occasion of his ruin was the following. He wanted to be initiated in the 
<A NAME="994"></A>Bacchic mysteries, and was on the point of obtaining admission to the rites, 
<A NAME="995"></A>when a most strange prodigy occurred to him. The house which he possessed, 
<A NAME="996"></A>as I mentioned a short time back, in the city of the Borysthenites, a building 
<A NAME="997"></A>of great extent and erected at a vast cost, round which there stood a number 
<A NAME="998"></A>of sphinxes and griffins carved in white marble, was struck by lightning 
<A NAME="999"></A>from on high, and burnt to the ground. Scylas, nevertheless, went on and 
<A NAME="1000"></A>received the initiation. Now the Scythians are wont to reproach the Greeks 
<A NAME="1001"></A>with their Bacchanal rage, and to say that it is not reasonable to imagine 
<A NAME="1002"></A>there is a god who impels men to madness. No sooner, therefore, was Scylas 
<A NAME="1003"></A>initiated in the Bacchic mysteries than one of the Borysthenites went and 
<A NAME="1004"></A>carried the news to the Scythians "You Scyths laugh at us" he said, "because 
<A NAME="1005"></A>we rave when the god seizes us. But now our god has seized upon your king, 
<A NAME="1006"></A>who raves like us, and is maddened by the influence. If you think I do 
<A NAME="1007"></A>not tell you true, come with me, and I will show him to you." The chiefs 
<A NAME="1008"></A>of the Scythians went with the man accordingly, and the Borysthenite, conducting 
<A NAME="1009"></A>them into the city, placed them secretly on one of the towers. Presently 
<A NAME="1010"></A>Scylas passed by with the band of revellers, raving like the rest, and 
<A NAME="1011"></A>was seen by the watchers. Regarding the matter as a very great misfortune 
<A NAME="1012"></A>they instantly departed, and came and told the army what they had 
<A NAME="1013"></A>witnessed.
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR><BR>When, therefore, Scylas, after leaving Borysthenes, was about returning 
<A NAME="1015"></A>home, the Scythians broke out into revolt. They put at their head Octamasadas, 
<A NAME="1016"></A>grandson (on the mother's side) of Teres. Then Scylas, when he learned 
<A NAME="1017"></A>the danger with which he was threatened, and the reason of the disturbance, 
<A NAME="1018"></A>made his escape to Thrace. Octamasadas, discovering whither he had fled, 
<A NAME="1019"></A>marched after him, and had reached the Ister, when he was met by the forces 
<A NAME="1020"></A>of the Thracians. The two armies were about to engage, but before they 
<A NAME="1021"></A>joined battle, Sitalces sent a message to Octamasadas to this effect- "Why 
<A NAME="1022"></A>should there be trial of arms betwixt thee and me? Thou art my own sister's 
<A NAME="1023"></A>son, and thou hast in thy keeping my brother. Surrender him into my hands, 
<A NAME="1024"></A>and I will give thy Scylas back to thee. So neither thou nor I will risk 
<A NAME="1025"></A>our armies." Sitalces sent this message to Octamasadas, by a herald, and 
<A NAME="1026"></A>Octamasadas, with whom a brother of Sitalces had formerly taken refuge, 
<A NAME="1027"></A>accepted the terms. He surrendered his own uncle to Sitalces, and obtained 
<A NAME="1028"></A>in exchange his brother Scylas. Sitalces took his brother with him and 
<A NAME="1029"></A>withdrew; but Octamasadas beheaded Scylas upon the spot. Thus rigidly do 
<A NAME="1030"></A>the Scythians maintain their own customs, and thus severely do they punish 
<A NAME="1031"></A>such as adopt foreign usages.
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR><BR>What the population of Scythia is I was not able to learn with 
<A NAME="1033"></A>certainty; the accounts which I received varied from one another. I heard 
<A NAME="1034"></A>from some that they were very numerous indeed; others made their numbers 
<A NAME="1035"></A>but scanty for such a nation as the Scyths. Thus much, however, I witnessed 
<A NAME="1036"></A>with my own eyes. There is a tract called Exampaeus between the Borysthenes 
<A NAME="1037"></A>and the Hypanis. I made some mention of it in a former place, where I spoke 
<A NAME="1038"></A>of the bitter stream which rising there flows into the Hypanis, and renders 
<A NAME="1039"></A>the water of that river undrinkable. Here then stands a brazen bowl, six 
<A NAME="1040"></A>times as big as that at the entrance of the Euxine, which Pausanias, the 
<A NAME="1041"></A>son of Cleombrotus, set up. Such as have never seen that vessel may understand 
<A NAME="1042"></A>me better if I say that the Scythian bowl holds with ease six hundred amphorae, 
<A NAME="1043"></A>and is of the thickness of six fingers' breadth. The natives gave me the 
<A NAME="1044"></A>following account of the manner in which it was made. One of their kings, 
<A NAME="1045"></A>by name Ariantas, wishing to know the number of his subjects, ordered them 
<A NAME="1046"></A>all to bring him, on pain of death, the point off one of their arrows. 
<A NAME="1047"></A>They obeyed; and he collected thereby a vast heap of arrow-heads, which 
<A NAME="1048"></A>he resolved to form into a memorial that might go down to posterity. Accordingly 
<A NAME="1049"></A>he made of them this bowl, and dedicated it at Exampaeus. This was all 
<A NAME="1050"></A>that I could learn concerning the number of the Scythians.
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR><BR>The country has no marvels except its rivers, which are larger 
<A NAME="1052"></A>and more numerous than those of any other land. These, and the vastness 
<A NAME="1053"></A>of the great plain, are worthy of note, and one thing besides, which I 
<A NAME="1054"></A>am about to mention. They show a footmark of Hercules, impressed on a rock, 
<A NAME="1055"></A>in shape like the print of a man's foot, but two cubits in length. It is 
<A NAME="1056"></A>in the neighbourhood of the Tyras. Having described this, I return to the 
<A NAME="1057"></A>subject on which I originally proposed to discourse.
<A NAME="1058"></A><BR><BR>The preparations of Darius against the Scythians had begun, messengers 
<A NAME="1059"></A>had been despatched on all sides with the king's commands, some being required 
<A NAME="1060"></A>to furnish troops, others to supply ships, others again to bridge the Thracian 
<A NAME="1061"></A>Bosphorus, when Artabanus, son of Hystaspes and brother of Darius, entreated 
<A NAME="1062"></A>the king to desist from his expedition, urging on him the great difficulty 
<A NAME="1063"></A>of attacking Scythia. Good, however, as the advice of Artabanus was, it 
<A NAME="1064"></A>failed to persuade Darius. He therefore ceased his reasonings; and Darius, 
<A NAME="1065"></A>when his preparations were complete, led his army forth from 
<A NAME="1066"></A>Susa.
<A NAME="1067"></A><BR><BR>It was then that a certain Persian, by name Oeobazus, the father 
<A NAME="1068"></A>of three sons, all of whom were to accompany the army, came and prayed 
<A NAME="1069"></A>the king that he would allow one of his sons to remain with him. Darius 
<A NAME="1070"></A>made answer, as if he regarded him in the light of a friend who had urged 
<A NAME="1071"></A>a moderate request, "that he would allow them all to remain." Oeobazus 
<A NAME="1072"></A>was overjoyed, expecting that all his children would be excused from serving; 
<A NAME="1073"></A>the king, however, bade his attendants take the three sons of Oeobazus 
<A NAME="1074"></A>and forthwith put them to death. Thus they were all left behind, but not 
<A NAME="1075"></A>till they had been deprived of life.
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR><BR>When Darius, on his march from Susa, reached the territory of Chalcedon 
<A NAME="1077"></A>on the shores of the Bosphorus, where the bridge had been made, he took 
<A NAME="1078"></A>ship and sailed thence to the Cyanean islands, which, according to the

<A NAME="1080"></A>the Pontus, which is indeed well worthy of consideration. There is not 
<A NAME="1081"></A>in the world any other sea so wonderful: it extends in length eleven thousand 
<A NAME="1082"></A>one hundred furlongs, and its breadth, at the widest part, is three thousand 
<A NAME="1083"></A>three hundred. The mouth is but four furlongs wide; and this strait, called

<A NAME="1085"></A>a hundred and twenty furlongs in length, reaching from the Euxine to the 
<A NAME="1086"></A>Propontis. The Propontis is five hundred furlongs across, and fourteen 
<A NAME="1087"></A>hundred long. Its waters flow into the Hellespont, the length of which 
<A NAME="1088"></A>is four hundred furlongs, and the width no more than seven. The Hellespont 
<A NAME="1089"></A>opens into the wide sea called the Egean.
