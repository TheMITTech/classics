<A NAME="start"></A>
<A NAME="10"></A><B>Calliope</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>Mardonius, when Alexander upon his return made known to him the 
<A NAME="12"></A>answer of the Athenians, forthwith broke up from Thessaly, and led his 
<A NAME="13"></A>army with all speed against Athens; forcing the several nations through 
<A NAME="14"></A>whose land he passed to furnish him with additional troops. The chief men 
<A NAME="15"></A>of Thessaly, far from repenting of the part which they had taken in the 
<A NAME="16"></A>war hitherto, urged on the Persians to the attack more earnestly than ever. 
<A NAME="17"></A>Thorax of Larissa in particular, who had helped to escort Xerxes on his 
<A NAME="18"></A>flight to Asia, now openly encouraged Mardonius in his march upon 
<A NAME="19"></A>Greece.
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><BR>When the army reached Boeotia, the Thebans sought to induce Mardonius 
<A NAME="21"></A>to make a halt: "He would not," they told him, "find anywhere a more convenient 
<A NAME="22"></A>place in which to pitch his camp; and their advice to him was, that he 
<A NAME="23"></A>should go no further, but fix himself there, and thence take measures to 
<A NAME="24"></A>subdue all Greece without striking a blow. If the Greeks, who had held 
<A NAME="25"></A>together hitherto, still continued united among themselves, it would be 
<A NAME="26"></A>difficult for the whole world to overcome them by force of arms. But if 
<A NAME="27"></A>thou wilt do as we advise," they went on to say, "thou mayest easily obtain 
<A NAME="28"></A>the direction of all their counsels. Send presents to the men of most weight 
<A NAME="29"></A>in the several states, and by so doing thou wilt sow division among them. 
<A NAME="30"></A>After that, it will be a light task, with the help of such as side with 
<A NAME="31"></A>thee, to bring under all thy adversaries."
<A NAME="32"></A><BR><BR>Such was the advice of the Thebans: but Mardonius did not follow 
<A NAME="33"></A>it. A strong desire of taking Athens a second time possessed him, in part 
<A NAME="34"></A>arising from his inborn stubbornness, in part from a wish to inform the 
<A NAME="35"></A>king at Sardis, by fire-signals along the islands, that he was master of 
<A NAME="36"></A>the place. However, he did not on his arrival in Attica find the Athenians 
<A NAME="37"></A>in their country- they had again withdrawn, some to their ships, but the 
<A NAME="38"></A>greater part to Salamis- and he only gained possession of a deserted town. 
<A NAME="39"></A>It was ten months after the taking of the city by the king that Mardonius 
<A NAME="40"></A>came against it for the second time.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR><BR>Mardonius, being now in Athens, sent an envoy to Salamis, one Murychides, 
<A NAME="42"></A>a Hellespontine Greek, to offer the Athenians once more the same terms 
<A NAME="43"></A>which had been conveyed to them by Alexander. The reason for his sending 
<A NAME="44"></A>a second time, though he knew beforehand their unfriendly feelings towards 
<A NAME="45"></A>him, was,- that he hoped, when they saw the whole land of Attica conquered 
<A NAME="46"></A>and in his power, their stubbornness would begin to give way. On this account, 
<A NAME="47"></A>therefore, he dispatched Murychides to Salamis.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>Now, when Murychides came before the council, and delivered his 
<A NAME="49"></A>message, one of the councillors, named Lycidas, gave it as his opinion- 
<A NAME="50"></A>"that the best course would be, to admit the proposals brought by Murychides, 
<A NAME="51"></A>and lay them before the assembly of the people." This he stated to be his 
<A NAME="52"></A>opinion, perhaps because he had been bribed by Mardonius, or it may be 
<A NAME="53"></A>because that course really appeared to him the most expedient. However, 
<A NAME="54"></A>the Athenians- both those in the council, and those who stood without, 
<A NAME="55"></A>when they heard of the advice- were full of wrath, and forthwith surrounded 
<A NAME="56"></A>Lycidas, and stoned him to death. As for Murychides, the Hellespontine 
<A NAME="57"></A>Greek, him they sent away unharmed. Now there was a stir in the island 
<A NAME="58"></A>about Lycidas, and the Athenian women learnt what had happened. Then each 
<A NAME="59"></A>exhorted her fellow, and one brought another to take part in the deed; 
<A NAME="60"></A>and they all flocked of their own accord to the house of Lycidas, and stoned 
<A NAME="61"></A>to death his wife and his children.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR>The circumstances under which the Athenians had sought refuge in 
<A NAME="63"></A>Salamis were the following. So long as any hope remained that a Peloponnesian 
<A NAME="64"></A>army would come to give them aid, they abode still in Attica; but when 
<A NAME="65"></A>it appeared that the allies were slack and slow to move, while the invader 
<A NAME="66"></A>was reported to be pressing forward and to have already entered Boeotia, 
<A NAME="67"></A>then they proceeded to remove their goods and chattels from the mainland, 
<A NAME="68"></A>and themselves again crossed the strait to Salamis. At the same time they 
<A NAME="69"></A>sent ambassadors to Lacedaemon, who were to reproach the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="70"></A>for having allowed the barbarian to advance into Attica, instead of joining 
<A NAME="71"></A>them and going out to meet him in Boeotia. They were likewise to remind 
<A NAME="72"></A>the Lacedaemonians of the offers by which the Persian had sought to win 
<A NAME="73"></A>Athens over to his side, and to warn them, that no aid came from Sparta, 
<A NAME="74"></A>the Athenians must consult for their own safety.
<A NAME="75"></A><BR><BR>The truth was, the Lacedaemonians were keeping holiday at that 
<A NAME="76"></A>time; for it was the feast of the Hyacinthia, and they thought nothing 
<A NAME="77"></A>of so much moment as to perform the service of the god. They were also 
<A NAME="78"></A>engaged in building their wall across the Isthmus, which was now so far 
<A NAME="79"></A>advanced that the battlements had begun to be placed upon 
<A NAME="80"></A>it.
<A NAME="81"></A><BR><BR>When the envoys of the Athenians, accompanied by ambassadors from 
<A NAME="82"></A>Megara and Plataea, reached Lacedaemon, they came before the Ephors, and 
<A NAME="83"></A>spoke as follows:-
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><BR>"The Athenians have sent us to you to say,- the king of the Medes 
<A NAME="85"></A>offers to give us back our country, and wishes to conclude an alliance 
<A NAME="86"></A>with us on fair and equal terms, without fraud or deceit. He is willing 
<A NAME="87"></A>likewise to bestow on us another country besides our own, and bids us choose 
<A NAME="88"></A>any land that we like. But we, because we reverenced Hellenic Jupiter, 
<A NAME="89"></A>and thought it a shameful act to betray Greece, instead of consenting to 
<A NAME="90"></A>these terms, refused them; notwithstanding that we have been wronged and 
<A NAME="91"></A>deserted by the other Greeks, and are fully aware that it is far more for 
<A NAME="92"></A>our advantage to make peace with the Persian than to prolong the war with 
<A NAME="93"></A>him. Still we shall not, of our own free will, consent to any terms of 
<A NAME="94"></A>peace. Thus do we, in all our dealings with the Greeks, avoid what is base 
<A NAME="95"></A>and counterfeit: while contrariwise, ye, who were but now so full of fear 
<A NAME="96"></A>least we should make terms with the enemy, having learnt of what temper 
<A NAME="97"></A>we are, and assured yourselves that we shall not prove traitors to our 
<A NAME="98"></A>country- having brought moreover your wall across the Isthmus to an advanced 
<A NAME="99"></A>state- cease altogether to have any care for us. Ye covenanted with us 
<A NAME="100"></A>to go out and meet the Persian in Boeotia; but when the time came, ye were 
<A NAME="101"></A>false to your word, and looked on while the barbarian host advanced into 
<A NAME="102"></A>Attica. At this time, therefore, the Athenians are angered with you; and 
<A NAME="103"></A>justly,- for ye have not done what was right. They bid you, however, make 
<A NAME="104"></A>haste to send forth your army, that we may even yet meet Mardonius in Attica. 
<A NAME="105"></A>Now that Boeotia is lost to us, the best place for the fight within our 
<A NAME="106"></A>country, will be the plain of Thria."
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR>The Ephors, when they had heard this speech, delayed their answer 
<A NAME="108"></A>till the morrow; and when the morrow came, till the day following. And 
<A NAME="109"></A>thus they acted for ten days, continually putting off the ambassadors from 
<A NAME="110"></A>one day to the next. Meanwhile the Peloponnesians generally were labouring 
<A NAME="111"></A>with great zeal at the wall, and the work nearly approached completion. 
<A NAME="112"></A>I can give no other reason for the conduct of the Lacedaemonians in showing 
<A NAME="113"></A>themselves so anxious, at the time when Alexander came, that the Athenians 
<A NAME="114"></A>should not join the Medes, and now being quite careless about it, except 
<A NAME="115"></A>that at the former time the wall across the Isthmus was not complete, and 
<A NAME="116"></A>they worked at it in great fear of the Persians, whereas now the bulwark 
<A NAME="117"></A>had been raised, and so they imagined that they had no further need of 
<A NAME="118"></A>the Athenians.
<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR>At last the ambassadors got an answer, and the troops marched forth 
<A NAME="120"></A>from Sparta, under the following circumstances. The last audience had been 
<A NAME="121"></A>fixed for the ambassadors, when, the very day before it was to be given, 
<A NAME="122"></A>a certain Tegean, named Chileus, a man who had more influence at Sparta 
<A NAME="123"></A>than any other foreigner, learning from the Ephors exactly what the Athenians 
<A NAME="124"></A>had said, addressed these words to them- "The case stands thus, O ye Ephors! 
<A NAME="125"></A>If the Athenians are not our friends, but league themselves with the barbarians, 
<A NAME="126"></A>however strong our wall across the Isthmus may be, there will be doors 
<A NAME="127"></A>enough, and wide enough open too, by which the Persian may gain entrance 
<A NAME="128"></A>to the Peloponnese. Grant their request then, before they make any fresh 
<A NAME="129"></A>resolve, which may bring Greece to ruin."
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR>Such was the counsel which Chileus gave: and the Ephors, taking 
<A NAME="131"></A>the advice into consideration, determined forthwith, without speaking a 
<A NAME="132"></A>word to the ambassadors from the three cities, to despatch to the Isthmus 
<A NAME="133"></A>a body of five thousand Spartans; and accordingly they sent them forth 
<A NAME="134"></A>the same night, appointing to each Spartan a retinue of seven Helots, and 
<A NAME="135"></A>giving the command of the expedition to Pausanias the son of Cleombrotus. 
<A NAME="136"></A>The chief power belonged of right at this time to Pleistarchus, the son 
<A NAME="137"></A>of Leonidas; but as he was still a child Pausanias, his cousin, was regent 
<A NAME="138"></A>in his room. For the father of Pausanias, Cleombrotus, the son of Anaxandridas, 
<A NAME="139"></A>no longer lived; he had died a short time after bringing back from the 
<A NAME="140"></A>Isthmus the troops who had been employed in building the wall. A prodigy 
<A NAME="141"></A>had caused him to bring his army home; for while he was offering sacrifice 
<A NAME="142"></A>to know if he should march out against the Persian, the sun was suddenly 
<A NAME="143"></A>darkened in mid sky. Pausanias took with him, as joint-leader of the army, 
<A NAME="144"></A>Euryanax, the son of Dorieus, a member of his own family.
<A NAME="145"></A><BR><BR>The army accordingly had marched out from Sparta with Pausanias: 
<A NAME="146"></A>while the ambassadors, when day came, appeared before the Ephors, knowing 
<A NAME="147"></A>nothing of the march of the troops, and purposing themselves to leave Sparta 
<A NAME="148"></A>forthwith, and return each man to his own country. They therefore addressed 
<A NAME="149"></A>the Ephors in these words:- "Lacedaemonians, as you do not stir from home, 
<A NAME="150"></A>but keep the Hyacinthian festival, and amuse yourselves, deserting the 
<A NAME="151"></A>cause of your confederates, the Athenians, whom your behaviour wrongs, 
<A NAME="152"></A>and who have no other allies, will make such terms with the Persians as 
<A NAME="153"></A>they shall find possible. Now when terms are once made, it is plain that, 
<A NAME="154"></A>having become the king's allies, we shall march with the barbarians whithersoever 
<A NAME="155"></A>they choose to lead. Then at length you will perceive what the consequences 
<A NAME="156"></A>will be to yourselves." When the envoys had spoken, the Ephors declared 
<A NAME="157"></A>to them with an oath:- "Our troops must be at Oresteum by this time, on 
<A NAME="158"></A>their march against the strangers." (The Spartans say "strangers" for "barbarians.") 
<A NAME="159"></A>At this the ambassadors, quite ignorant of what had happened, questioned 
<A NAME="160"></A>them concerning their meaning; and when, by much questioning, they had 
<A NAME="161"></A>discovered the truth, they were greatly astonished thereat, and forthwith 
<A NAME="162"></A>set off, at their best speed, to overtake the Spartan army. At the same 
<A NAME="163"></A>time a body of five thousand Lacedaemonian Perioeci, all picked men and 
<A NAME="164"></A>fully armed, set forth from Sparta, in the company of the 
<A NAME="165"></A>ambassadors.
<A NAME="166"></A><BR><BR>So these troops marched in haste towards the Isthmus. Meanwhile 
<A NAME="167"></A>the Argives, who had promised Mardonius that they would stop the Spartans 
<A NAME="168"></A>from crossing their borders, as soon as they learnt that Pausanias with 
<A NAME="169"></A>his army had started from Sparta, took the swiftest courier they could 
<A NAME="170"></A>find, and sent him off to Attica. The message which he delivered, on his 
<A NAME="171"></A>arrival at Athens, was the following: "Mardonius," he said, "the Argives 
<A NAME="172"></A>have sent me to tell thee that the Lacedaemonian youth are gone forth from 
<A NAME="173"></A>their city, and that the Argives are too weak to hinder them. Take good 
<A NAME="174"></A>heed therefore to thyself at this time." After thus speaking, without a 
<A NAME="175"></A>word more, he returned home.
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR>When Mardonius learnt that the Spartans were on their march, he 
<A NAME="177"></A>no longer cared to remain in Attica. Hitherto he had kept quiet, wishing 
<A NAME="178"></A>to see what the Athenians would do, and had neither ravaged their territory, 
<A NAME="179"></A>nor done it any the least harm; for till now he had cherished the hope 
<A NAME="180"></A>that the Athenians would come to terms with him. As, however, he found 
<A NAME="181"></A>that his persuasions were of no avail, and as their whole policy was now 
<A NAME="182"></A>clear to him, he determined to withdraw from Attica before Pausanias with 
<A NAME="183"></A>his army reached the Isthmus; first, however, he resolved to burn Athens, 
<A NAME="184"></A>and to cast down and level with the ground whatever remained standing of 
<A NAME="185"></A>the walls, temples, and other buildings. His reason for retreating was, 
<A NAME="186"></A>that Attica was not a country where horse could act with advantage; and 
<A NAME="187"></A>further, that if he suffered defeat in a battle, no way of escape was open 
<A NAME="188"></A>to him, except through defiles, where a handful of troops might stop all 
<A NAME="189"></A>his army. So he determined to withdraw to Thebes, and give the Greeks battle 
<A NAME="190"></A>in the neighbourhood of a friendly city, and on ground well suited for 
<A NAME="191"></A>cavalry.
<A NAME="192"></A><BR><BR>After he had quitted Attica and was already upon his march, news 
<A NAME="193"></A>reached him that a body of a thousand Lacedaemonians, distinct from the 
<A NAME="194"></A>army of Pausanias, and sent on in advance, had arrived in the Megarid. 
<A NAME="195"></A>When he heard it, wishing, if possible, to destroy this detachment first, 
<A NAME="196"></A>Mardonius considered with himself how he might compass their ruin. With 
<A NAME="197"></A>a sudden change of march he made for Megara, while the horse, pushing on 
<A NAME="198"></A>in advance, entered and ravaged the Megarid. (Here was the furthest point 
<A NAME="199"></A>in Europe towards the setting sun to which this Persian army ever 
<A NAME="200"></A>penetrated.)
<A NAME="201"></A><BR><BR>After this, Mardonius received another message, whereby he learnt 
<A NAME="202"></A>that the forces of the Greeks were collected together at the Isthmus; which 
<A NAME="203"></A>tidings caused him to draw back, and leave Attica by the way of Deceleia. 
<A NAME="204"></A>The Boeotarchs had sent for some of the neighbours of the Asopians; and 
<A NAME="205"></A>these persons served as guides to the army, and led them first to Sphendale, 
<A NAME="206"></A>and from thence to Tanagra, where Mardonius rested a night; after which, 
<A NAME="207"></A>upon the morrow, he bent his course to Scolus, which brought him into the 
<A NAME="208"></A>territory of the Thebans. And now, although the Thebans had espoused the 
<A NAME="209"></A>cause of the Medes, yet Mardonius cut down all the trees in these parts; 
<A NAME="210"></A>not however from any enmity towards the Thebans, but on account of his 
<A NAME="211"></A>own urgent needs; for he wanted a rampart to protect his army from attack, 
<A NAME="212"></A>and he likewise desired to have a place of refuge, whither his troops might 
<A NAME="213"></A>flee, in case the battle should go contrary to his wishes. His army at 
<A NAME="214"></A>this time lay on the Asopus, and stretched from Erythrae, along by Hysiae, 
<A NAME="215"></A>to the territory of the Plataeans. The wall, however, was not made to extend 
<A NAME="216"></A>so far, but formed a square of about ten furlongs each 
<A NAME="217"></A>way.
<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR>While the barbarians were employed in this work, a certain citizen 
<A NAME="219"></A>of Thebes, Attaginus by name, the son of Phrynon, having made great preparations, 
<A NAME="220"></A>gave a banquet, and invited Mardonius thereto, together with fifty of the 
<A NAME="221"></A>noblest Persians. Now the banquet was held at Thebes; and all the guests 
<A NAME="222"></A>who were invited came to it.
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR>What follows was recounted to me by Thersander, a native of Orchomenus, 
<A NAME="224"></A>a man of the first rank in that city. Thersander told me that he was himself 
<A NAME="225"></A>among those invited to the feast, and that besides the Persians fifty Thebans 
<A NAME="226"></A>were asked; and the two nations were not arranged separately, but a Persian 
<A NAME="227"></A>and a Theban were set side by side upon each couch. After the feast was 
<A NAME="228"></A>ended, and the drinking had begun, the Persian who shared Thersander's 
<A NAME="229"></A>couch addressed him in the Greek tongue, and inquired of him from what 
<A NAME="230"></A>city he came. He answered, that he was of Orchomenus; whereupon the other 
<A NAME="231"></A>said-
<A NAME="232"></A><BR><BR>"Since thou hast eaten with me at one table, and poured libation 
<A NAME="233"></A>from one cup, I would fain leave with thee a memorial of the belief I hold- 
<A NAME="234"></A>the rather that thou mayest have timely warning thyself, and so be able 
<A NAME="235"></A>to provide for thy own safety. Seest thou these Persians here feasting, 
<A NAME="236"></A>and the army which we left encamped yonder by the river-side? Yet a little 
<A NAME="237"></A>while, and of all this number thou wilt behold but a few 
<A NAME="238"></A>surviving!"
<A NAME="239"></A><BR><BR>As he spake, the Persian let fall a flood of tears: whereon Thersander, 
<A NAME="240"></A>who was astonished at his words, replied- "Surely thou shouldest say all 
<A NAME="241"></A>this to Mardonius, and the Persians who are next him in honour"- but the 
<A NAME="242"></A>other rejoined- "Dear friend, it is not possible for man to avert that 
<A NAME="243"></A>which God has decreed shall happen. No one believes warnings, however true. 
<A NAME="244"></A>Many of us Persians know our danger, but we are constrained by necessity 
<A NAME="245"></A>to do as our leader bids us. Verily 'tis the sorest of all human ills, 
<A NAME="246"></A>to abound in knowledge and yet have no power over action." All this I heard 
<A NAME="247"></A>myself from Thersander the Orchomenian; who told me further, that he mentioned 
<A NAME="248"></A>what had happened to divers persons, before the battle was fought at 
<A NAME="249"></A>Plataea.
<A NAME="250"></A><BR><BR>When Mardonius formerly held his camp in Boeotia, all the Greeks 
<A NAME="251"></A>of those parts who were friendly to the Medes sent troops to join his army, 
<A NAME="252"></A>and these troops accompanied him in his attack upon Athens. The Phocians 
<A NAME="253"></A>alone abstained, and took no part in the invasion; for, though they had 
<A NAME="254"></A>espoused the Median cause warmly, it was very much against their will, 
<A NAME="255"></A>and only because they were compelled so to do. However, a few days after 
<A NAME="256"></A>the arrival of the Persian army at Thebes, a thousand of their heavy-armed 
<A NAME="257"></A>soldiers came up, under the command of Harmocydes, one of their most distinguished 
<A NAME="258"></A>citizens. No sooner had these troops reached Thebes, than some horsemen 
<A NAME="259"></A>came to them from Mardonius, with orders that they should take up a position 
<A NAME="260"></A>upon the plain, away from the rest of the army. The Phocians did so, and 
<A NAME="261"></A>forthwith the entire Persian cavalry drew nigh to them: whereupon there 
<A NAME="262"></A>went a rumour through the whole of the Greek force encamped with the Medes, 
<A NAME="263"></A>that Mardonius was about to destroy the Phocians with missiles. The same 
<A NAME="264"></A>conviction ran through the Phocian troops themselves; and Harmocydes, their 
<A NAME="265"></A>leader, addressed them thus with words of encouragement- "Phocians" said 
<A NAME="266"></A>he, "'tis plain that these men have resolved beforehand to take our lives, 
<A NAME="267"></A>because of the accusations of the Thessalians, as I imagine. Now, then, 
<A NAME="268"></A>is the time for you all to show yourselves brave men. 'Tis better to die 
<A NAME="269"></A>fighting and defending our lives, than tamely to allow them to slay us 
<A NAME="270"></A>in this shameful fashion. Let them learn that they are barbarians, and 
<A NAME="271"></A>that the men whose death they have plotted are Greeks!"
<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR>Thus spake Harmocydes; and the Persian horse, having encircled 
<A NAME="273"></A>the Phocians, charged towards them, as if about to deal out death, with 
<A NAME="274"></A>bows bent, and arrows ready to be let fly; nay, here and there some did 
<A NAME="275"></A>even discharge their weapons. But the Phocians stood firm, keeping close 
<A NAME="276"></A>one to another, and serrying their ranks as much as possible: whereupon 
<A NAME="277"></A>the horse suddenly wheeled round and rode off. I cannot say with certainty 
<A NAME="278"></A>whether they came, at the prayer of the Thessalians, to destroy the Phocians, 
<A NAME="279"></A>but seeing them prepared to stand on their defence, and fearing to suffer 
<A NAME="280"></A>damage at their hands, on that account beat a retreat, having orders from 
<A NAME="281"></A>Mardonius so to act; or whether his sole intent was to try the temper of 
<A NAME="282"></A>the Phocians and see whether they had any courage or no. However this may 
<A NAME="283"></A>have been, when the horsemen retired, Mardonius sent a herald to the Phocians, 
<A NAME="284"></A>saying- "Fear not, Phocians- ye have shown yourselves valiant men- much 
<A NAME="285"></A>unlike the report I had heard of you. Now therefore be forward in the coming 
<A NAME="286"></A>war. Ye will not readily outdo either the king or myself in services." 
<A NAME="287"></A>Thus ended the affair of the Phocians.
<A NAME="288"></A><BR><BR>The Lacedaemonians, when they reached the Isthmus, pitched their 
<A NAME="289"></A>camp there; and the other Peloponnesians who had embraced the good side, 
<A NAME="290"></A>hearing or else seeing that they were upon the march, thought it not right 
<A NAME="291"></A>to remain behind when the Spartans were going forth to the war. So the 
<A NAME="292"></A>Peloponnesians went out in one body from the Isthmus, the victims being 
<A NAME="293"></A>favourable for setting forth; and marched as far as Eleusis, where again 
<A NAME="294"></A>they offered sacrifices, and, finding the omens still encouraging, advanced 
<A NAME="295"></A>further. At Eleusis they were joined by the Athenians, who had come across 
<A NAME="296"></A>from Salamis, and now accompanied the main army. On reaching Erythrae in 
<A NAME="297"></A>Boeotia, they learnt that the barbarians were encamped upon the Asopus; 
<A NAME="298"></A>wherefore they themselves, after considering how they should act, disposed 
<A NAME="299"></A>their forces opposite to the enemy upon the slopes of Mount 
<A NAME="300"></A>Cithaeron.
<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR>Mardonius, when he saw that the Greeks would not come down into 
<A NAME="302"></A>the plain, sent all his cavalry, under Masistius (or Macistius, as the 
<A NAME="303"></A>Greeks call him), to attack them where they were. Now Masistius was a man 
<A NAME="304"></A>of much repute among the Persians, and rode a Nisaean charger with a golden 
<A NAME="305"></A>bit, and otherwise magnificently caparisoned. So the horse advanced against 
<A NAME="306"></A>the Greeks, and made attacks upon them in divisions, doing them great damage 
<A NAME="307"></A>at each charge, and insulting them by calling them women.
<A NAME="308"></A><BR><BR>It chanced that the Megarians were drawn up in the position most 
<A NAME="309"></A>open to attack, and where the ground offered the best approach to the cavalry. 
<A NAME="310"></A>Finding themselves therefore hard pressed by the assaults upon their ranks, 
<A NAME="311"></A>they sent a herald to the Greek leaders, who came and said to them, "This 
<A NAME="312"></A>is the message of the Megarians- We cannot, brothers-in-arms, continue 
<A NAME="313"></A>to resist the Persian horse in that post which we have occupied from the 
<A NAME="314"></A>first, if we are left without succours. Hitherto, although hard pressed, 
<A NAME="315"></A>we have held out against them firmly and courageously. Now, however, if 
<A NAME="316"></A>you do not send others to take our place, we warn you that we shall quit 
<A NAME="317"></A>our post." Such were the words of the herald. Pausanias, when he heard 
<A NAME="318"></A>them, inquired among his troops if there were any who would volunteer to 
<A NAME="319"></A>take the post, and so relieve the Megarians. Of the rest none were willing 
<A NAME="320"></A>to go, whereupon the Athenians offered themselves; and a body of picked 
<A NAME="321"></A>men, three hundred in number, commanded by Olympiodorus, the son of Lampo, 
<A NAME="322"></A>undertook the service.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR><BR>Selecting, to accompany them, the whole body of archers, these 
<A NAME="324"></A>men relieved the Megarians, and occupied a post which all the other Greeks 
<A NAME="325"></A>collected at Erythrae had shrunk from holding. After the struggle had continued 
<A NAME="326"></A>for a while, it came to an end on this wise. As the barbarians continued 
<A NAME="327"></A>charging in divisions, the horse of Masistius, which was in front of the 
<A NAME="328"></A>others, received an arrow in his flank, the pain of which caused him to 
<A NAME="329"></A>rear and throw his rider. Immediately the Athenians rushed upon Masistius 
<A NAME="330"></A>as he lay, caught his horse, and when he himself made resistance, slew 
<A NAME="331"></A>him. At first, however, they were not able to take his life; for his armour 
<A NAME="332"></A>hindered them. He had on a breastplate formed of golden scales, with a 
<A NAME="333"></A>scarlet tunic covering it. Thus the blows, all falling upon his breastplate, 
<A NAME="334"></A>took no effect, till one of the soldiers, perceiving the reason, drove 
<A NAME="335"></A>his weapon into his eye and so slew him. All this took place without any 
<A NAME="336"></A>of the other horsemen seeing it: they had neither observed their leader 
<A NAME="337"></A>fall from his horse, nor beheld him slain; for he fell as they wheeled 
<A NAME="338"></A>round and prepared for another charge, so that they were quite ignorant 
<A NAME="339"></A>of what had happened. When, however, they halted, and found that there 
<A NAME="340"></A>was no one to marshal their line, Masistius was missed; and instantly his 
<A NAME="341"></A>soldiers, understanding what must have befallen him, with loud cheers charged 
<A NAME="342"></A>the enemy in one mass, hoping to recover the dead body.
<A NAME="343"></A><BR><BR>So when the Athenians saw that, instead of coming up in squadrons, 
<A NAME="344"></A>the whole mass of the horse was about to charge them at once, they called 
<A NAME="345"></A>out to the other troops to make haste to their aid. While the rest of the 
<A NAME="346"></A>infantry, however, was moving to their assistance, the contest waxed fierce 
<A NAME="347"></A>about the dead body of Masistius. The three hundred, so long as they fought 
<A NAME="348"></A>by themselves, had greatly the worse of the encounter, and were forced 
<A NAME="349"></A>to retire and yield up the body to the enemy; but when the other troops 
<A NAME="350"></A>approached, the Persian horse could no longer hold their ground, but fled 
<A NAME="351"></A>without carrying off the body, having incurred in the attempt a further 
<A NAME="352"></A>loss of several of their number. They therefore retired about two furlongs, 
<A NAME="353"></A>and consulted with each other what was best to be done. Being without a 
<A NAME="354"></A>leader, it seemed to them the fittest course to return to 
<A NAME="355"></A>Mardonius.
<A NAME="356"></A><BR><BR>When the horse reached the camp, Mardonius and all the Persian 
<A NAME="357"></A>army made great lamentation for Masistius. They shaved off all the hair 
<A NAME="358"></A>from their own heads, and cut the manes from their war-horses and their 
<A NAME="359"></A>sumpter-beasts, while they vented their grief in such loud cries that all 
<A NAME="360"></A>Boeotia resounded with the clamour, because they had lost the man who, 
<A NAME="361"></A>next to Mardonius, was held in the greatest esteem, both by the king and 
<A NAME="362"></A>by the Persians generally. So the barbarians, after their own fashion, 
<A NAME="363"></A>paid honours to the dead Masistius.
<A NAME="364"></A><BR><BR>The Greeks, on the other hand, were greatly emboldened by what 
<A NAME="365"></A>had happened, seeing that they had not only stood their ground against 
<A NAME="366"></A>the attacks of the horse, but had even compelled them to beat a retreat. 
<A NAME="367"></A>They therefore placed the dead body of Masistius upon a cart, and paraded 
<A NAME="368"></A>it along the ranks of the army. Now the body was a sight which well deserved 
<A NAME="369"></A>to be gazed upon, being remarkable both for stature and for beauty; and 
<A NAME="370"></A>it was to stop the soldiers from leaving their ranks to look at it, that 
<A NAME="371"></A>they resolved to carry it round. After this the Greeks determined to quit 
<A NAME="372"></A>the high ground and go nearer Plataea, as the land there seemed far more 
<A NAME="373"></A>suitable for an encampment than the country about Erythrae, particularly 
<A NAME="374"></A>because it was better supplied with water. To this place therefore, and 
<A NAME="375"></A>more especially to a spring-head which was called Gargaphia, they considered 
<A NAME="376"></A>that it would be best for them to remove, after which they might once more 
<A NAME="377"></A>encamp in their order. So they took their arms, and proceeded along the 
<A NAME="378"></A>slopes of Cithaeron, past Hysiae, to the territory of the Plataeans; and 
<A NAME="379"></A>here they drew themselves up, nation by nation, close by the fountain Gargaphia, 
<A NAME="380"></A>and the sacred precinct of the Hero Androcrates, partly along some hillocks 
<A NAME="381"></A>of no great height, and partly upon the level of the 
<A NAME="382"></A>plain.
<A NAME="383"></A><BR><BR>Here, in the marshalling of the nations, a fierce battle of words 
<A NAME="384"></A>arose between the Athenians and the Tegeans, both of whom claimed to have 
<A NAME="385"></A>one of the wings assigned to them. On each side were brought forward the 
<A NAME="386"></A>deeds which they had done, whether in earlier or in later times; and first 
<A NAME="387"></A>the Tegeans urged their claim as follows:-
<A NAME="388"></A><BR><BR>"This post has been always considered our right, and not the right 
<A NAME="389"></A>of any of the other allies, in all the expeditions which have been entered 
<A NAME="390"></A>into conjointly by the Peloponnesians, both anciently and in later times. 
<A NAME="391"></A>Ever since the Heraclidae made their attempt, after the death of Eurystheus, 
<A NAME="392"></A>to return by force of arms into the Peloponnese, this custom has been observed. 
<A NAME="393"></A>It was then that the right became ours, and this was the way in which we 
<A NAME="394"></A>gained it:- When, in company with the Achaeans and Ionians who then dwelt 
<A NAME="395"></A>in the Peloponnese, we marched out to the Isthmus, and pitched our camp 
<A NAME="396"></A>over against the invaders, then, as the tale goes, that Hyllus made proclamation, 
<A NAME="397"></A>saying- 'It needs not to imperil two armies in a general battle; rather 
<A NAME="398"></A>let one be chosen from the Peloponnesian ranks, whomsoever they deem the 
<A NAME="399"></A>bravest, and let him engage with me in single combat, on such terms as 
<A NAME="400"></A>shall be agreed upon.' The saying pleased the Peloponnesians, and oaths 
<A NAME="401"></A>were sworn to the effect following:- 'If Hyllus conquer the Peloponnesian 
<A NAME="402"></A>champion, the Heraclidae shall return to their inheritance; if, on the 
<A NAME="403"></A>other hand, he be conquered, the Heraclidae shall withdraw, lead back their 
<A NAME="404"></A>army, and engage for the next hundred years to make no further endeavours 
<A NAME="405"></A>to force their return." Hereupon Echemus, the son of Aeropus and grandson 
<A NAME="406"></A>of Phegeus, who was our leader and king, offered himself, and was preferred 
<A NAME="407"></A>before all his brothers-in-arms as champion, engaged in single combat with 
<A NAME="408"></A>Hyllus, and slew him upon the spot. For this exploit we were rewarded by 
<A NAME="409"></A>the Peloponnesians of that day with many goodly privileges, which we have 
<A NAME="410"></A>ever since enjoyed; and, among the rest, we obtained the right of holding 
<A NAME="411"></A>the leading post in one wing, whenever a joint expedition goes forth beyond 
<A NAME="412"></A>our borders. With you then, O Lacedaemonians, we do not claim to compete; 
<A NAME="413"></A>choose you which wing ye please; we yield and grant you the preference: 
<A NAME="414"></A>but we maintain that the command of the other wing belongs of right to 
<A NAME="415"></A>us, now no less than formerly. Moreover, set aside this exploit which we 
<A NAME="416"></A>have related, and still our title to the chief post is better than that 
<A NAME="417"></A>of the Athenians: witness the many glorious fights in which we have been 
<A NAME="418"></A>engaged against yourselves, O Spartans! as well as those which we have 
<A NAME="419"></A>maintained with others. We have therefore more right to this place than 
<A NAME="420"></A>they; for they have performed no exploits to be compared to ours, whether 
<A NAME="421"></A>we look to earlier or to later times."
<A NAME="422"></A><BR><BR>Thus spake the Tegeans; and the Athenians made reply as follows:- 
<A NAME="423"></A>"We are not ignorant that our forces were gathered here, not for the purpose 
<A NAME="424"></A>of speech-making, but for battle against the barbarian. Yet as the Tegeans 
<A NAME="425"></A>have been pleased to bring into debate the exploits performed by our two 
<A NAME="426"></A>nations, alike in carlier and in later times, we have no choice but to 
<A NAME="427"></A>set before you the grounds on which we claim it as our heritage, deserved 
<A NAME="428"></A>by our unchanging bravery, to be preferred above Arcadians. In the first 
<A NAME="429"></A>place, then, those very Heraclidae, whose leader they boast to have slain 
<A NAME="430"></A>at the Isthmus, and whom the other Greeks would not receive when they asked 
<A NAME="431"></A>a refuge from the bondage wherewith they were threatened by the people 
<A NAME="432"></A>of Mycinae, were given a shelter by us; and we brought down the insolence 
<A NAME="433"></A>of Eurystheus, and helped to gain the victory over those who were at that 
<A NAME="434"></A>time lords of the Peloponnese. Again, when the Argives led their troops 
<A NAME="435"></A>with Polynices against Thebes, and were slain and refused burial, it is 
<A NAME="436"></A>our boast that we went out against the Cadmeians, recovered the bodies, 
<A NAME="437"></A>and buried them at Eleusis in our own territory. Another noble deed of 
<A NAME="438"></A>ours was that against the Amazons, when they came from their seats upon 
<A NAME="439"></A>the Thermodon, and poured their hosts into Attica; and in the Trojan war 
<A NAME="440"></A>too we were not a whit behind any of the Greeks. But what boots it to speak 
<A NAME="441"></A>of these ancient matters? A nation which was brave in those days might 
<A NAME="442"></A>have grown cowardly since, and a nation of cowards then might now be valiant. 
<A NAME="443"></A>Enough therefore of our ancient achievements. Had we performed no other 
<A NAME="444"></A>exploit than that at Marathon- though in truth we have performed exploits 
<A NAME="445"></A>as many and as noble as any of the Greeks- yet had we performed no other, 
<A NAME="446"></A>we should deserve this privilege, and many a one beside. There we stood 
<A NAME="447"></A>alone, and singly fought with the Persians; nay, and venturing on so dangerous 
<A NAME="448"></A>a cast, we overcame the enemy, and conquered on that day forty and six 
<A NAME="449"></A>nations! Does not this one achievement suffice to make good our title to 
<A NAME="450"></A>the post we claim? Nevertheless, Lacedaemonians, as to strive concerning 
<A NAME="451"></A>place at such a time as this is not right, we are ready to do as ye command, 
<A NAME="452"></A>and to take our station at whatever part of the line, and face whatever 
<A NAME="453"></A>nation ye think most expedient. Wheresoever ye place us, 'twill be our 
<A NAME="454"></A>endeavour to behave as brave men. Only declare your will, and we shall 
<A NAME="455"></A>at once obey you."
<A NAME="456"></A><BR><BR>Such was the reply of the Athenians; and forthwith all the Lacedaemonian 
<A NAME="457"></A>troops cried out with one voice, that the Athenians were worthier to have 
<A NAME="458"></A>the left wing than the Arcadians. In this way were the Tegeans overcome; 
<A NAME="459"></A>and the post was assigned to the Athenians.
<A NAME="460"></A><BR><BR>When this matter had been arranged, the Greek army, which was in 
<A NAME="461"></A>part composed of those who came at the first, in part of such as had flocked 
<A NAME="462"></A>in from day to day, drew up in the following order:- Ten thousand Lacedaemonian 
<A NAME="463"></A>troops held the right wing, five thousand of whom were Spartans; and these 
<A NAME="464"></A>five thousand were attended by a body of thirty-five thousand Helots, who 
<A NAME="465"></A>were only lightly armed- seven Helots to each Spartan. The place next to 
<A NAME="466"></A>themselves the Spartans gave to the Tegeans, on account of their courage 
<A NAME="467"></A>and of the esteem in which they held them. They were all fully armed, and 
<A NAME="468"></A>numbered fifteen hundred men. Next in order came the Corinthians, five 
<A NAME="469"></A>thousand strong; and with them Pausanias had placed, at their request, 
<A NAME="470"></A>the band of three hundred which had come from Potidaea in Pallene. The 
<A NAME="471"></A>Arcadians of Orchomenus, in number six hundred, came next; then the Sicyonians, 
<A NAME="472"></A>three thousand; then the Epidaurians, eight hundred; then the Troezenians, 
<A NAME="473"></A>one thousand; then the Lepreats, two hundred; the Mycenaeans and Tirynthians, 
<A NAME="474"></A>four hundred; the Phliasians, one thousand; the Hermionians, three hundred; 
<A NAME="475"></A>the Eretrians and Styreans, six hundred; the Chalcideans, four hundred; 
<A NAME="476"></A>and the Ambraciots, five hundred. After these came the Leucadians and Anactorians, 
<A NAME="477"></A>who numbered eight hundred; the Paleans of Cephallenia, two hundred; the 
<A NAME="478"></A>Eginetans, five hundred; the Megarians, three thousand; and the Plataeans, 
<A NAME="479"></A>six hundred. Last of all, but first at their extremity of the line, were 
<A NAME="480"></A>the Athenians, who, to the number of eight thousand, occupied the left 
<A NAME="481"></A>wing, under the command of Aristides, the son of Lysimachus.
<A NAME="482"></A><BR><BR>All these, except the Helots- seven of whom, as I said, attended 
<A NAME="483"></A>each Spartan- were heavy-armed troops; and they amounted to thirty-eight 
<A NAME="484"></A>thousand seven hundred men. This was the number of Hoplites, or heavy-armed 
<A NAME="485"></A>soldiers, which was together against the barbarian. The light-armed troops 
<A NAME="486"></A>consisted of the thirty-five thousand ranged with the Spartans, seven in 
<A NAME="487"></A>attendance upon each, who were all well equipped for war; and of thirty-four 
<A NAME="488"></A>thousand five hundred others, belonging to the Lacedaemonians and the rest 
<A NAME="489"></A>of the Greeks, at the rate (nearly) of one light to one heavy armed. Thus 
<A NAME="490"></A>the entire number of the light-armed was sixty-nine thousand five 
<A NAME="491"></A>hundred.
<A NAME="492"></A><BR><BR>The Greek army, therefore, which mustered at Plataea, counting 
<A NAME="493"></A>light-armed as well as heavy-armed, was but eighteen hundred men short 
<A NAME="494"></A>of one hundred and ten thousand; and this amount was exactly made up by 
<A NAME="495"></A>the Thespians who were present in the camp; for eighteen hundred Thespians, 
<A NAME="496"></A>being the whole number left, were likewise with the army; but these men 
<A NAME="497"></A>were without arms. Such was the array of the Greek troops when they took 
<A NAME="498"></A>post on the Asopus.
<A NAME="499"></A><BR><BR>The barbarians under Mardonius, when the mourning for Masistius 
<A NAME="500"></A>was at an end, and they learnt that the Greeks were in the Plataean territory, 
<A NAME="501"></A>moved likewise towards the river Asopus, which flows in those parts. On 
<A NAME="502"></A>their arrival Mardonius marshalled them against the Greeks in the following 
<A NAME="503"></A>order:- Against the Lacedaemonians he posted his Persians; and as the Persians 
<A NAME="504"></A>were far more numerous he drew them up with their ranks deeper than common, 
<A NAME="505"></A>and also extended their front so that part faced the Tegeans; and here 
<A NAME="506"></A>he took care to choose out the best troops to face the Lacedaemonians, 
<A NAME="507"></A>whilst against the Tegeans he arrayed those on whom he could not so much 
<A NAME="508"></A>depend. This was done at the suggestion and by the advice of the Thebans. 
<A NAME="509"></A>Next to the Persians he placed the Medes, facing the Corinthians, Potidaeans, 
<A NAME="510"></A>Orchomenians, and Sicyonians; then the Bactrians, facing the Epidaurians, 
<A NAME="511"></A>Troezenians, Lepreats, Tirynthians, Mycenaeans, and Phliasians; after them 
<A NAME="512"></A>the Indians, facing the Hermionians, Eretrians, Styreans, and Chalcidians; 
<A NAME="513"></A>then the Sacans, facing the Ambraciots, Anactorians, Leucadians, Paleans, 
<A NAME="514"></A>and Eginetans; last of all, facing the Athenians, the Plataeans, and the 
<A NAME="515"></A>Megarians, he placed the troops of the Boeotians, Locrians, Malians, and 
<A NAME="516"></A>Thessalians, and also the thousand Phocians. The whole nation of the Phocians 
<A NAME="517"></A>had not joined the Medes; on the contrary, there were some who had gathered 
<A NAME="518"></A>themselves into bands about Parnassus, and made expeditions from thence, 
<A NAME="519"></A>whereby they distressed Mardonius and the Greeks who sided with him, and 
<A NAME="520"></A>so did good service to the Grecian cause. Besides those mentioned above, 
<A NAME="521"></A>Mardonius likewise arrayed against the Athenians the Macedonians and the 
<A NAME="522"></A>tribes dwelling about Thessaly.
<A NAME="523"></A><BR><BR>I have named here the greatest of the nations which were marshalled 
<A NAME="524"></A>by Mardonius on this occasion, to wit, all those of most renown and account. 
<A NAME="525"></A>Mixed with these, however, were men of divers other peoples, as Phrygians, 
<A NAME="526"></A>Thracians, Mysians, Paeonians, and the like; Ethiopians again, and Egyptians, 
<A NAME="527"></A>both of the Hermotybian and Calascirian races, whose weapon is the sword, 
<A NAME="528"></A>and who are the only fighting men in that country. These persons had formerly 
<A NAME="529"></A>served on board the fleet of Xerxes, but Mardonius disembarked them before 
<A NAME="530"></A>he left Phalerum; in the land force which Xerxes brought to Athens there 
<A NAME="531"></A>were no Egyptians. The number of the barbarians, as I have already mentioned, 
<A NAME="532"></A>was three hundred thousand; that of the Greeks who had made alliance with 
<A NAME="533"></A>Mardonius is known to none, for they were never counted: I should guess 
<A NAME="534"></A>that they mustered near fifty thousand strong. The troops thus marshalled 
<A NAME="535"></A>were all foot soldiers. As for the horse, it was drawn up by 
<A NAME="536"></A>itself.
<A NAME="537"></A><BR><BR>When the marshalling of Mardonius' troops by nations and by maniples 
<A NAME="538"></A>was ended, the two armies proceeded on the next day to offer sacrifice. 
<A NAME="539"></A>The Grecian sacrifice was offered by Tisamenus, the son of Antiochus, who 
<A NAME="540"></A>accompanied the army as soothsayer: he was an Elean, and belonged to the 
<A NAME="541"></A>Clytiad branch of the Iamidae, but had been admitted among their own citizens 
<A NAME="542"></A>by the Lacedaemonians. Now his admission among them was on this wise:- 
<A NAME="543"></A>Tisamenus had gone to Delphi to consult the god concerning his lack of 
<A NAME="544"></A>offspring, when it was declared to him by the Pythoness that he would win 
<A NAME="545"></A>five very glorious combats. Misunderstanding the oracle, and imagining 
<A NAME="546"></A>that he was to win combats in the games, Tisamenus at once applied himself 
<A NAME="547"></A>to the practice of gymnastics. He trained himself for the Pentathlum, and, 
<A NAME="548"></A>on contending at Olympia, came within a little of winning it; for he was 
<A NAME="549"></A>successful in everything, except the wrestling-match, which was carried 
<A NAME="550"></A>off by Hieronymus the Andrian. Hereon the Lacedaemonians perceived that 
<A NAME="551"></A>the combats of which the oracle spoke were not combats in the games, but 
<A NAME="552"></A>battles: they therefore sought to induce Tisamenus to hire out his services 
<A NAME="553"></A>to them, in order that they might join him with their Heracleid kings in 
<A NAME="554"></A>the conduct of their wars. He however, when he saw that they set great 
<A NAME="555"></A>store by his friendship, forthwith raised his price, and told them, "If 
<A NAME="556"></A>they would receive him among their citizens, and give him equal rights 
<A NAME="557"></A>with the rest, he was willing to do as they desired, but on no other terms 
<A NAME="558"></A>would they ever gain his consent." The Spartans, when they heard this, 
<A NAME="559"></A>at first thought it monstrous, and ceased to implore his aid. Afterwards, 
<A NAME="560"></A>however, when the fearful danger of the Persian war hung over their heads, 
<A NAME="561"></A>they sent for him and agreed to his terms; but Tisamenus now, perceiving 
<A NAME="562"></A>them so changed, declared, "He could no longer be content with what he 
<A NAME="563"></A>had asked before: they must likewise make his brother Hagias a Spartan, 
<A NAME="564"></A>with the same rights as himself."
<A NAME="565"></A><BR><BR>In acting thus he did but follow the example once set by Melampus, 
<A NAME="566"></A>at least if kingship may be compared with citizenship. For when the women 
<A NAME="567"></A>of Argos were seized with madness, and the Argives would have hired Melampus 
<A NAME="568"></A>to come from Pylos and heal them of their disease, he demanded as his reward 
<A NAME="569"></A>one-half of the kingdom; but as the Argives disdained to stoop to this, 
<A NAME="570"></A>they left him and went their way. Afterwards, however, when many more of 
<A NAME="571"></A>their women were seized, they brought themselves to agree to his terms; 
<A NAME="572"></A>and accordingly they went again to him, and said they were content to give 
<A NAME="573"></A>what he required. Hereon Melampus, seeing them so changed, raised his demand, 
<A NAME="574"></A>and told them, "Except they would give his brother Bias one-third of the 
<A NAME="575"></A>kingdom likewise, he would not do as they wished." So, as the Argives were 
<A NAME="576"></A>in a strait, they consented even to this.
<A NAME="577"></A><BR><BR>In like manner the Spartans, as they were in great need of Tisamenus, 
<A NAME="578"></A>yielded everything: and Tisamenus the Elean, having in this way become 
<A NAME="579"></A>a Spartan citizen, afterwards, in the capacity of soothsayer, helped the 
<A NAME="580"></A>Spartans to gain five very glorious combats. He and his brother were the 
<A NAME="581"></A>only men whom the Spartans ever admitted to citizenship. The five combats 
<A NAME="582"></A>were these following:- The first was the combat at Plataea; the second, 
<A NAME="583"></A>that near Tegea, against the Tegeans and the Argives; the third, that at 
<A NAME="584"></A>Dipaeeis, against all the Arcadians excepting those of Mantinea; the fourth, 
<A NAME="585"></A>that at the Isthmus, against the Messenians; and the fifth, that at Tanagra, 
<A NAME="586"></A>against the Athenians and the Argives. The battle here fought was the last 
<A NAME="587"></A>of all the five.
<A NAME="588"></A><BR><BR>The Spartans had now brought Tisamenus with them to the Plataean 
<A NAME="589"></A>territory, where he acted as soothsayer for the Greeks. He found the victims 
<A NAME="590"></A>favourable, if the Greeks stood on the defensive, but not if they began 
<A NAME="591"></A>the battle or crossed the river Asopus.
<A NAME="592"></A><BR><BR>With Mardonius also, who was very eager to begin the battle, the 
<A NAME="593"></A>victims were not favourable for so doing; but he likewise found them bode 
<A NAME="594"></A>him well, if he was content to stand on his defence. He too had made use 
<A NAME="595"></A>of the Grecian rites; for Hegesistratus, an Elean, and the most renowned 
<A NAME="596"></A>of the Telliads, was his soothsayer. This man had once been taken captive 
<A NAME="597"></A>by the Spartans, who, considering that he had done them many grievous injuries, 
<A NAME="598"></A>laid him in bonds, with the intent to put him to death. Thereupon Hegesistratus, 
<A NAME="599"></A>finding himself in so sore a case, since not only was his life in danger, 
<A NAME="600"></A>but he knew that he would have to suffer torments of many kinds before 
<A NAME="601"></A>his death,- Hegesistratus, I say, did a deed for which no words suffice. 
<A NAME="602"></A>He had been set with one foot in the stocks, which were of wood but bound 
<A NAME="603"></A>with iron bands; and in this condition received from without an iron implement, 
<A NAME="604"></A>wherewith he contrived to accomplish the most courageous deed upon record. 
<A NAME="605"></A>Calculating how much of his foot he would be able to draw through the hole, 
<A NAME="606"></A>he cut off the front portion with his own hand; and then, as he was guarded 
<A NAME="607"></A>by watchmen, forced a way through the wall of his prison, and made his 
<A NAME="608"></A>escape to Tegea, travelling during the night, but in the daytime stealing 
<A NAME="609"></A>into the woods, and staying there. In this way, though the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="610"></A>went out in full force to search for him, he nevertheless escaped, and 
<A NAME="611"></A>arrived the third evening at Tegea. So the Spartans were amazed at the 
<A NAME="612"></A>man's endurance, when they saw on the ground the piece which he had cut 
<A NAME="613"></A>off his foot, and yet for all their seeking could not find him anywhere. 
<A NAME="614"></A>Hegesistratus, having thus escaped the Lacedaemonians, took refuge in Tegea; 
<A NAME="615"></A>for the Tegeans at that time were ill friends with the Lacedaemonians. 
<A NAME="616"></A>When his wound was healed, he procured himself a wooden foot, and became 
<A NAME="617"></A>an open enemy to Sparta. At the last, however, this enmity brought him 
<A NAME="618"></A>to trouble; for the Spartans took him captive as he was exercising his 
<A NAME="619"></A>office in Zacynthus, and forthwith put him to death. But these things happened 
<A NAME="620"></A>some while after the fight at Plataea. At present he was serving Mardonius 
<A NAME="621"></A>on the Asopus, having been hired at no inconsiderable price; and here he 
<A NAME="622"></A>offered sacrifice with a right good will, in part from his hatred of the 
<A NAME="623"></A>Lacedaemonians, in part for lucre's sake.
<A NAME="624"></A><BR><BR>So when the victims did not allow either the Persians or their 
<A NAME="625"></A>Greek allies to begin the battle- these Greeks had their own soothsayer 
<A NAME="626"></A>in the person of Hippomachus, a Leucadian- and when soldiers continued 
<A NAME="627"></A>to pour into the opposite camp and the numbers on the Greek side to increase 
<A NAME="628"></A>continually, Timagenidas, the son of Herpys, a Theban, advised Mardonius 
<A NAME="629"></A>to keep a watch on the passes of Cithaeron, telling him how supplies of 
<A NAME="630"></A>men kept flocking in day after day, and assuring him that he might cut 
<A NAME="631"></A>off large numbers.
<A NAME="632"></A><BR><BR>It was eight days after the two armies first encamped opposite 
<A NAME="633"></A>to one another when this advice was given by Timagenidas. Mardonius, seeing 
<A NAME="634"></A>it to be good, as soon as evening came, sent his cavalry to that pass of 
<A NAME="635"></A>Mount Cithaeron which opens out upon Plataea, a pass called by the Boeotians 
<A NAME="636"></A>the "Three Heads," called the "Oak-Heads" by the Athenians. The horse sent 
<A NAME="637"></A>on this errand did not make the movement in vain. They came upon a body 
<A NAME="638"></A>of five hundred sumpter-beasts which were just entering the plain, bringing 
<A NAME="639"></A>provisions to the Greek camp from the Peloponnese, with a number of men 
<A NAME="640"></A>driving them. Seeing this prey in their power, the Persians set upon them 
<A NAME="641"></A>and slaughtered them, sparing none, neither man nor beast; till at last, 
<A NAME="642"></A>when they had had enough of slaying, they secured such as were left, and 
<A NAME="643"></A>bore them off to the camp to Mardonius.
<A NAME="644"></A><BR><BR>After this they waited again for two days more, neither army wishing 
<A NAME="645"></A>to begin the fight. The barbarians indeed advanced as far as the Asopus, 
<A NAME="646"></A>and endeavoured to tempt the Greeks to cross; but neither side actually 
<A NAME="647"></A>passed the stream. Still the cavalry of Mardonius harassed and annoyed 
<A NAME="648"></A>the Greeks incessantly; for the Thebans, who were zealous in the cause 
<A NAME="649"></A>of the Medes, pressed the war forward with all eagerness, and often led 
<A NAME="650"></A>the charge till the lines met, when the Medes and Persians took their place, 
<A NAME="651"></A>and displayed, many of them, uncommon valour.
<A NAME="652"></A><BR><BR>For ten days nothing was done more than this; but on the eleventh 
<A NAME="653"></A>day from the time when the two hosts first took station, one over against 
<A NAME="654"></A>the other, near Plataea- the number of the Greeks being now much greater 
<A NAME="655"></A>than it was at the first, and Mardonius being impatient of the delay- there 
<A NAME="656"></A>was a conference held between Mardonius, son of Gobryas, and Artabazus, 
<A NAME="657"></A>son of Pharnaces, a man who was esteemed by Xerxes more than almost any 
<A NAME="658"></A>of the Persians. At this consultation the following were the opinions delivered:- 
<A NAME="659"></A>Artabazus thought it would be best for them to break up from their quarters 
<A NAME="660"></A>as soon as possible, and withdraw the whole army to the fortified town 
<A NAME="661"></A>of Thebes, where they had abundant stores of corn for themselves, and of 
<A NAME="662"></A>fodder for the sumpter-beasts. There, he said, they had only to sit quiet, 
<A NAME="663"></A>and the war might be brought to an end on this wise:- Coined gold was plentiful 
<A NAME="664"></A>in the camp, and uncoined gold too; they had silver moreover in great abundance, 
<A NAME="665"></A>and drinking-cups. Let them not spare to take of these, and distribute 
<A NAME="666"></A>them among the Greeks, especially among the leaders in the several cities; 
<A NAME="667"></A>'twould not be long before the Greeks gave up their liberty, without risking 
<A NAME="668"></A>another battle for it. Thus the opinion of Artabazus agreed with that of 
<A NAME="669"></A>the Thebans; for he too had more foresight than some. Mardonius, on the 
<A NAME="670"></A>other hand, expressed himself with more fierceness and obstinacy, and was 
<A NAME="671"></A>utterly disinclined to yield. "Their army," he said, "was vastly superior 
<A NAME="672"></A>to that of the Greeks; and they had best engage at once, and not wait till 
<A NAME="673"></A>greater numbers were gathered against them. As for Hegesistratus and his 
<A NAME="674"></A>victims, they should let them pass unheeded, not seeking to force them 
<A NAME="675"></A>to be favourable, but, according to the old Persian custom, hasting to 
<A NAME="676"></A>join battle."
<A NAME="677"></A><BR><BR>When Mardonius had thus declared his sentiments, no one ventured 
<A NAME="678"></A>to say him nay; and accordingly his opinion prevailed, for it was to him, 
<A NAME="679"></A>and not to Artabazus, that the king had given the command of the 
<A NAME="680"></A>army.
<A NAME="681"></A><BR><BR>Mardonius now sent for the captains of the squadrons, and the leaders 
<A NAME="682"></A>of the Greeks in his service, and questioned them:- "Did they know of any 
<A NAME="683"></A>prophecy which said that the Persians were to be destroyed in Greece?" 
<A NAME="684"></A>All were silent; some because they did not know the prophecies, but others, 
<A NAME="685"></A>who knew them full well, because they did not think it safe to speak out. 
<A NAME="686"></A>So Mardonius, when none answered, said, "Since ye know of no such oracle, 
<A NAME="687"></A>or do not dare to speak of it, I, who know it well, will myself declare 
<A NAME="688"></A>it to you. There is an oracle which says that the Persians shall come into 
<A NAME="689"></A>Greece, sack the temple at Delphi, and when they have so done, perish one 
<A NAME="690"></A>and all. Now we, as we are aware of the prediction, will neither go against 
<A NAME="691"></A>the temple  nor make any attempt to sack it: we therefore shall not perish 
<A NAME="692"></A>for this trespass. Rejoice then thus far, all ye who are well-wishers to 
<A NAME="693"></A>the Persians, and doubt not we shall get the better of the Greeks." When 
<A NAME="694"></A>he had so spoken, he further ordered them to prepare themselves, and to 
<A NAME="695"></A>put all in readiness for a battle upon the morrow.
<A NAME="696"></A><BR><BR>As for the oracle of which Mardonius spoke, and which he referred 
<A NAME="697"></A>to the Persians, it did not, I am well assured, mean them, but the Illyrians 
<A NAME="698"></A>and the Enchelean host. There are, however, some verses of Bacis which 
<A NAME="699"></A>did speak of this battle:-
<A NAME="700"></A><BR><BR>By Thermodon's stream, and the grass-clad hanks of 
<A NAME="701"></A>Asopus,
<A NAME="702"></A><BR>See where gather the Grecians, and hark to the foreigners' 
<A NAME="703"></A>war-shout-
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>There in death shall lie, ere fate or Lachesis doomed 
<A NAME="705"></A>him,
<A NAME="706"></A><BR>Many a bow-bearing Mede, when the day of calamity cometh. These verses, 
<A NAME="707"></A>and some others like them which Musaeus wrote, referred, I well know, to 
<A NAME="708"></A>the Persians. The river Thermodon flows between Tanagra and 
<A NAME="709"></A>Glisas.
<A NAME="710"></A><BR><BR>After Mardonius had put his question about the prophecies, and 
<A NAME="711"></A>spoken the above words of encouragement, night drew on apace, and on both 
<A NAME="712"></A>sides the watches were set. As soon then as there was silence throughout 
<A NAME="713"></A>the camp,- the night being now well advanced, and the men seeming to be 
<A NAME="714"></A>in their deepest sleep,- Alexander, the son of Amyntas, king and leader 
<A NAME="715"></A>of the Macedonians, rode up on horseback to the Athenian outposts, and 
<A NAME="716"></A>desired to speak with the generals. Hereupon, while the greater part continued 
<A NAME="717"></A>on guard, some of the watch ran to the chiefs, and told them, "There had 
<A NAME="718"></A>come a horseman from the Median camp who would not say a word, except that 
<A NAME="719"></A>he wished to speak with the generals, of whom he mentioned the 
<A NAME="720"></A>names."
<A NAME="721"></A><BR><BR>They at once, hearing this, made haste to the outpost, where they 
<A NAME="722"></A>found Alexander, who addressed them as follows:-
<A NAME="723"></A><BR><BR>"Men of Athens, that which I am about to say I trust to your honour; 
<A NAME="724"></A>and I charge you to keep it secret from all excepting Pausanias, if you 
<A NAME="725"></A>would not bring me to destruction. Had I not greatly at heart the common 
<A NAME="726"></A>welfare of Greece, I should not have come to tell you; but I am myself 
<A NAME="727"></A>a Greek by descent, and I would not willingly see Greece exchange freedom 
<A NAME="728"></A>for slavery. Know then that Mardonius and his army cannot obtain favourable 
<A NAME="729"></A>omens; had it not been for this, they would have fought with you long ago. 
<A NAME="730"></A>Now, however, they have determined to let the victims pass unheeded, and, 
<A NAME="731"></A>as soon as day dawns, to engage in battle. Mardonius, I imagine, is afraid 
<A NAME="732"></A>that, if he delays, you will increase in number. Make ready then to receive 
<A NAME="733"></A>him. Should he however still defer the combat, do you abide where you are; 
<A NAME="734"></A>for his provisions will not hold out many more days. If ye prosper in this 
<A NAME="735"></A>war, forget not to do something for my freedom; consider the risk I have 
<A NAME="736"></A>run, out of zeal for the Greek cause, to acquaint you with what Mardonius 
<A NAME="737"></A>intends, and to save you from being surprised by the barbarians. I am Alexander 
<A NAME="738"></A>of Macedon."
<A NAME="739"></A><BR><BR>As soon as he had said this, Alexander rode back to the camp, and 
<A NAME="740"></A>returned to the station assigned him.
<A NAME="741"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile the Athenian generals hastened to the right wing, and 
<A NAME="742"></A>told Pausanias all that they had learnt from Alexander. Hereupon Pausanias, 
<A NAME="743"></A>who no sooner heard the intention of the Persians than he was struck with 
<A NAME="744"></A>fear, addressed the generals, and said,-
<A NAME="745"></A><BR><BR>"Since the battle is to come with to-morrow's dawn, it were well 
<A NAME="746"></A>that you Athenians should stand opposed to the Persians, and we Spartans 
<A NAME="747"></A>to the Boeotians and the other Greeks; for ye know the Medes and their 
<A NAME="748"></A>manner of fight, since ye have already fought with them once at Marathon, 
<A NAME="749"></A>but we are quite ignorant and without any experience of their warfare. 
<A NAME="750"></A>While, however, there is not a Spartan here present who has ever fought 
<A NAME="751"></A>against a Mede, of the Boeotians and Thessalians we have had experience. 
<A NAME="752"></A>Take then your arms, and march over to our post upon the right, while we 
<A NAME="753"></A>supply your place in the left wing."
<A NAME="754"></A><BR><BR>Hereto the Athenians replied- "We, too, long ago, when we saw that 
<A NAME="755"></A>the Persians were drawn up to face you, were minded to suggest to you the 
<A NAME="756"></A>very course which you have now been the first to bring forward. We feared, 
<A NAME="757"></A>however, that perhaps our words might not be pleasing to you. But, as you 
<A NAME="758"></A>have now spoken of these things yourselves, we gladly give our consent, 
<A NAME="759"></A>and are ready to do as ye have said."
<A NAME="760"></A><BR><BR>Both sides agreeing hereto, at the dawn of day the Spartans and 
<A NAME="761"></A>Athenians changed places. But the movement was perceived by the Boeotians, 
<A NAME="762"></A>and they gave notice of it to Mardonius; who at once, on hearing what had 
<A NAME="763"></A>been done, made a change in the disposition of his own forces, and brought 
<A NAME="764"></A>the Persians to face the Lacedaemonians. Then Pausanias, finding that his 
<A NAME="765"></A>design was discovered, led back his Spartans to the right wing; and Mardonius, 
<A NAME="766"></A>seeing this, replaced his Persians upon the left of his 
<A NAME="767"></A>army.
<A NAME="768"></A><BR><BR>When the troops again occupied their former posts, Mardonius sent 
<A NAME="769"></A>a herald to the Spartans, who spoke as follows:-
<A NAME="770"></A><BR><BR>"Lacedaemonians, in these parts the men say that you are the bravest 
<A NAME="771"></A>of mankind, and admire you because you never turn your backs in flight 
<A NAME="772"></A>nor quit your ranks, but always stand firm, and either die at your posts 
<A NAME="773"></A>or else destroy your adversaries. But in all this which they say concerning 
<A NAME="774"></A>you there is not one word of truth; for now have we seen you, before battle 
<A NAME="775"></A>was joined or our two hosts had come to blows, flying and leaving your 
<A NAME="776"></A>posts, wishing the Athenians to make the first trial of our arms, and taking 
<A NAME="777"></A>your own station against our slaves. Surely these are not the deeds of 
<A NAME="778"></A>brave men. Much do we find ourselves deceived in you; for we believed the 
<A NAME="779"></A>reports of you that reached our ears, and expected that you would send 
<A NAME="780"></A>a herald with a challenge to us, proposing to fight by yourselves against 
<A NAME="781"></A>our division of native Persians. We for our part were ready to have agreed 
<A NAME="782"></A>to this; but ye have made us no such offer- nay! ye seem rather to shrink 
<A NAME="783"></A>from meeting us. However, as no challenge of this kind comes from you to 
<A NAME="784"></A>us, lo! we send a challenge to you. Why should not you on the part of the 
<A NAME="785"></A>Greeks, as you are thought to be the bravest of all, and we on the part 
<A NAME="786"></A>of the barbarians, fight a battle with equal numbers on both sides? Then, 
<A NAME="787"></A>if it seems good to the others to fight likewise, let them engage afterwards- 
<A NAME="788"></A>but if not,- if they are content that we should fight on behalf of all, 
<A NAME="789"></A>let us so do- and whichever side wins the battle, let them win it for their 
<A NAME="790"></A>whole army."
<A NAME="791"></A><BR><BR>When the herald had thus spoken, he waited a while, but, as no 
<A NAME="792"></A>one made him any answer, he went back, and told Mardonius what had happened. 
<A NAME="793"></A>Mardonius was full of joy thereat, and so puffed up by the empty victory, 
<A NAME="794"></A>that he at once gave orders to his horse to charge the Greek line. Then 
<A NAME="795"></A>the horsemen drew near, and with their javelins and their arrows- for though 
<A NAME="796"></A>horsemen they used the bow- sorely distressed the Greek troops, which could 
<A NAME="797"></A>not bring them to close combat. The fountain of Gargaphia, whence the whole 
<A NAME="798"></A>Greek army drew its water, they at this time choked up and spoiled. The 
<A NAME="799"></A>Lacedaemonians were the only troops who had their station near this fountain; 
<A NAME="800"></A>the other Greeks were more or less distant from it, according to their 
<A NAME="801"></A>place in the line; they however were not far from the Asopus. Still, as 
<A NAME="802"></A>the Persian horse with their missile weapons did not allow them to approach, 
<A NAME="803"></A>and so they could not get their water from the river, these Greeks, no 
<A NAME="804"></A>less than the Lacedaemonians, resorted at this time to the 
<A NAME="805"></A>fountain.
<A NAME="806"></A><BR><BR>When the fountain was choked, the Grecian captains, seeing that 
<A NAME="807"></A>the army had no longer a water-place, and observing moreover that the cavalry 
<A NAME="808"></A>greatly harassed them, held a meeting on these and other matters at the 
<A NAME="809"></A>headquarters of Pausanias upon the right. For besides the above-named difficulties, 
<A NAME="810"></A>which were great enough, other circumstances added to their distress. All 
<A NAME="811"></A>the provisions that they had brought with them were gone; and the attendants 
<A NAME="812"></A>who had been sent to fetch supplies from the Peloponnese, were prevented 
<A NAME="813"></A>from returning to camp by the Persian horse, which had now closed the 
<A NAME="814"></A>passage.
<A NAME="815"></A><BR><BR>The captains therefore held a council, whereat it was agreed, that 
<A NAME="816"></A>if the Persians did not give battle that day, the Greeks should move to 
<A NAME="817"></A>the Island- a tract of ground which lies in front of Plataea, at the distance 
<A NAME="818"></A>of ten furlongs from the Asopus and fount Gargaphia, where the army was 
<A NAME="819"></A>encamped at that time. This tract was a sort of island in the continent: 
<A NAME="820"></A>for there is a river which, dividing near its source, runs down from Mount 
<A NAME="821"></A>Cithaeron into the plain below in two streams, flowing in channels about 
<A NAME="822"></A>three furlongs apart, which after a while unite and become one. The name 
<A NAME="823"></A>of this river is Oeroe, and the dwellers in those parts call it, the daughter 
<A NAME="824"></A>of the Asopus. This was the place to which the Greeks resolved to remove; 
<A NAME="825"></A>and they chose it, first because they would there have no lack of water, 
<A NAME="826"></A>and secondly, because the horse could not harass them as when it was drawn 
<A NAME="827"></A>up right in their front. They thought it best to begin their march at the 
<A NAME="828"></A>second watch of the night, lest the Persians should see them as they left 
<A NAME="829"></A>their station, and should follow and harass them with their cavalry. It 
<A NAME="830"></A>was agreed likewise, that after they had reached the place, which the Asopus-born 
<A NAME="831"></A>Oeroe surrounds, as it flows down from Cithaeron, they should despatch, 
<A NAME="832"></A>the very same night, one half of their army towards that mountain-range, 
<A NAME="833"></A>to relieve those whom they had sent to procure provisions, and who were 
<A NAME="834"></A>now blocked up in that region.
<A NAME="835"></A><BR><BR>Having made these resolves, they continued during that whole day 
<A NAME="836"></A>to suffer beyond measure from the attacks of the enemy's horse. At length 
<A NAME="837"></A>when towards dusk the attacks of the horse ceased, and, night having closed 
<A NAME="838"></A>in, the hour arrived at which the army was to commence its retreat, the 
<A NAME="839"></A>greater number struck their tents and began the march towards the rear. 
<A NAME="840"></A>They were not minded, however, to make for the place agreed upon; but in 
<A NAME="841"></A>their anxiety to escape from the Persian horse, no sooner had they begun 
<A NAME="842"></A>to move than they fled straight to Plataea; where they took post at the 
<A NAME="843"></A>temple of Juno, which lies outside the city, at the distance of about twenty 
<A NAME="844"></A>furlongs from Gargaphia; and here they pitched their camp in front of the 
<A NAME="845"></A>sacred building.
<A NAME="846"></A><BR><BR>As soon as Pausanias saw a portion of the troops in motion, he 
<A NAME="847"></A>issued orders to the Lacedaemonians to strike their tents and follow those 
<A NAME="848"></A>who had been the first to depart, supposing that they were on their march 
<A NAME="849"></A>to the place agreed upon. All the captains but one were ready to obey his 
<A NAME="850"></A>orders: Amompharetus, however, the son of Poliadas, who was leader of the 
<A NAME="851"></A>Pitanate cohort, refused to move, saying, "He for one would not fly from 
<A NAME="852"></A>the strangers, or of his own will bring disgrace upon Sparta." It had happened 
<A NAME="853"></A>that he was absent from the former conference of the captains; and so what 
<A NAME="854"></A>was now taking place astonished him. Pausanias and Euryanax thought it 
<A NAME="855"></A>a monstrous thing that Amompharetus would not hearken to them; but considered 
<A NAME="856"></A>that it would be yet more monstrous, if, when he was so minded, they were 
<A NAME="857"></A>to leave the Pitanates to their fate; seeing that, if they forsook them 
<A NAME="858"></A>to keep their agreement with the other Greeks, Amompharetus and those with 
<A NAME="859"></A>him might perish. On this account, therefore, they kept the Lacedaemonian 
<A NAME="860"></A>force in its place, and made every endeavour to persuade Amompharetus that 
<A NAME="861"></A>he was wrong to act as he was doing.
<A NAME="862"></A><BR><BR>While the Spartans were engaged in these efforts to turn Amompharetus- 
<A NAME="863"></A>the only man unwilling to retreat either in their own army or in that of 
<A NAME="864"></A>the Tegeans- the Athenians on their side did as follows. Knowing that it 
<A NAME="865"></A>was the Spartan temper to say one thing and no another, they remained quiet 
<A NAME="866"></A>in their station until the army began to retreat, when they despatched 
<A NAME="867"></A>a horseman to see whether the Spartans really meant to set forth, or whether 
<A NAME="868"></A>after all they had no intention of moving. The horseman was also to ask 
<A NAME="869"></A>Pausanias what he wished the Athenians to do.
<A NAME="870"></A><BR><BR>The herald on his arrival found the Lacedaemonians drawn up in 
<A NAME="871"></A>their old position, and their leaders quarrelling with one another. Pausanias 
<A NAME="872"></A>and Euryanax had gone on urging Amompharetus not to endanger the lives 
<A NAME="873"></A>of his men by staying behind while the others drew off, but without succeeding 
<A NAME="874"></A>in persuading him; until at last the dispute had waxed hot between them 
<A NAME="875"></A>just at the moment when the Athenian herald arrived. At this point Amompharetus, 
<A NAME="876"></A>who was still disputing, took up with both his hands a vast rock, and placed 
<A NAME="877"></A>it at the feet of Pausanias, saying- "With this pebble I give my vote not 
<A NAME="878"></A>to run away from the strangers." (By "strangers" he meant barbarians.) 
<A NAME="879"></A>Pausanias, in reply, called him a fool and a madman, and, turning to the 
<A NAME="880"></A>Athenian herald, who had made the inquiries with which he was charged, 
<A NAME="881"></A>bade him tell his countrymen how he was occupied, and ask them to approach 
<A NAME="882"></A>nearer, and retreat or not according to the movements of the 
<A NAME="883"></A>Spartans.
<A NAME="884"></A><BR><BR>So the herald went back to the Athenians; and the Spartans continued 
<A NAME="885"></A>to dispute till morning began to dawn upon them. Then Pausanias, who as 
<A NAME="886"></A>yet had not moved, gave the signal for retreat- expecting (and rightly, 
<A NAME="887"></A>as the event proved) that Amompharetus, when he saw the rest of the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="888"></A>in motion, would be unwilling to be left behind. No sooner was the signal 
<A NAME="889"></A>given, than all the army except the Pitanates began their march, and retreated 
<A NAME="890"></A>along the line of the hills; the Tegeans accompanying them. The Athenians 
<A NAME="891"></A>likewise set off in good order, but proceeded by a different way from the 
<A NAME="892"></A>Lacedaemonians. For while the latter clung to the hilly ground and the 
<A NAME="893"></A>skirts of Mount Cithaeron, on account of the fear which they entertained 
<A NAME="894"></A>of the enemy's horse, the former betook themselves to the low country and 
<A NAME="895"></A>marched through the plain.
<A NAME="896"></A><BR><BR>As for Amompharetus, at first he did not believe that Pausanias 
<A NAME="897"></A>would really dare to leave him behind; he therefore remained firm in his 
<A NAME="898"></A>resolve to keep his men at their post; when, however, Pausanias and his 
<A NAME="899"></A>troops were now some way off, Amompharetus, thinking himself forsaken in 
<A NAME="900"></A>good earnest, ordered his band to take their arms, and led them at a walk 
<A NAME="901"></A>towards the main army. Now the army was waiting for them at a distance 
<A NAME="902"></A>of about ten furlongs, having halted upon the river Moloeis at a place 
<A NAME="903"></A>called Argiopius, where stands a temple dedicated to Eleusinian Ceres. 
<A NAME="904"></A>They had stopped here, that, in case Amompharetus and his band should refuse 
<A NAME="905"></A>to quit the spot where they were drawn up, and should really not stir from 
<A NAME="906"></A>it, they might have it in their power to move back and lend them assistance. 
<A NAME="907"></A>Amompharetus, however, and his companions rejoined the main body; and at 
<A NAME="908"></A>the same time the whole mass of the barbarian cavalry arrived and began 
<A NAME="909"></A>to press hard upon them. The horsemen had followed their usual practice 
<A NAME="910"></A>and ridden up to the Greek camp, when they discovered that the place where 
<A NAME="911"></A>the Greeks had been posted hitherto was deserted. Hereupon they pushed 
<A NAME="912"></A>forward without stopping, and, as soon as they overtook the enemy, pressed 
<A NAME="913"></A>heavily on them.
<A NAME="914"></A><BR><BR>Mardonius, when he heard that the Greeks had retired under cover 
<A NAME="915"></A>of the night, and beheld the place, where they had been stationed, empty, 
<A NAME="916"></A>called to him Thorax of Larissa, and his brethren, Eurypylus and Thrasideius, 
<A NAME="917"></A>and said:-
<A NAME="918"></A><BR><BR>"O sons of Aleuas! what will ye say now, when ye see yonder place 
<A NAME="919"></A>empty? Why, you, who dwell in their neighbourhood, told me the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="920"></A>never fled from battle, but were brave beyond all the rest of mankind. 
<A NAME="921"></A>Lately, however, you yourselves beheld them change their place in the line; 
<A NAME="922"></A>and here, as all may see, they have run away during the night. Verily, 
<A NAME="923"></A>when their turn came to fight with those who are of a truth the bravest 
<A NAME="924"></A>warriors in all the world, they showed plainly enough that they are men 
<A NAME="925"></A>of no worth, who have distinguished themselves among Greeks- men likewise 
<A NAME="926"></A>of no worth at all. However, I can readily excuse you, who, knowing nothing 
<A NAME="927"></A>of the Persians, praised these men from your acquaintance with certain 
<A NAME="928"></A>exploits of theirs; but I marvel all the more at Artabazus, that he should 
<A NAME="929"></A>have been afraid of the Lacedaemonians, and have therefore given us so 
<A NAME="930"></A>dastardly a counsel,- bidding us, as did, break up our camp, and remove 
<A NAME="931"></A>to Thebes, and there allow ourselves to be besieged by the Greeks- advice 
<A NAME="932"></A>whereof I shall take care to inform the king. But of this hereafter. Now 
<A NAME="933"></A>we must not allow them to escape us, but must pursue after them till we 
<A NAME="934"></A>overtake them; and then we must exact vengeance for all the wrongs which 
<A NAME="935"></A>have been suffered at their hands by the Persians."
<A NAME="936"></A><BR><BR>When he had so spoken, he crossed the Asopus, and led the Persians 
<A NAME="937"></A>forward at a run directly upon the track of the Greeks, whom he believed 
<A NAME="938"></A>to be in actual flight. He could not see the Athenians; for, as they had 
<A NAME="939"></A>taken the way of the plain, they were hidden from his sight by the hills; 
<A NAME="940"></A>he therefore led on his troops against the Lacedaemonians and the Tegeans 
<A NAME="941"></A>only. When the commanders of the other divisions of the barbarians saw 
<A NAME="942"></A>the Persians pursuing the Greeks so hastily, they all forthwith seized 
<A NAME="943"></A>their standards, and hurried after at their best speed in great disorder 
<A NAME="944"></A>and disarray. On they went with loud shouts and in a wild rout, thinking 
<A NAME="945"></A>to swallow up the runaways.
<A NAME="946"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile Pausanias had sent a horseman to the Athenians, at the 
<A NAME="947"></A>time when the cavalry first fell upon him, with this 
<A NAME="948"></A>message:-
<A NAME="949"></A><BR><BR>"Men of Athens! now that the great struggle has come, which is 
<A NAME="950"></A>to decide the freedom or the slavery of Greece, we twain, Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="951"></A>and Athenians, are deserted by all the other allies, who have fled away 
<A NAME="952"></A>from us during the past night. Nevertheless, we are resolved what to do- 
<A NAME="953"></A>we must endeavour, as best we may, to defend ourselves and to succour one 
<A NAME="954"></A>another. Now, had the horse fallen upon you first, we ourselves with the 
<A NAME="955"></A>Tegeans (who remain faithful to the Greek cause) would have been bound 
<A NAME="956"></A>to render you assistance against them. As, however, the entire body has 
<A NAME="957"></A>advanced upon us, 'tis your place to come to our aid, sore pressed as we 
<A NAME="958"></A>are by the enemy. Should you yourselves be so straitened that you cannot 
<A NAME="959"></A>come, at least send us your archers, and be sure you will earn our gratitude. 
<A NAME="960"></A>We acknowledge that throughout this whole war there has been no zeal to 
<A NAME="961"></A>be compared to yours- we therefore doubt not that you will do us this 
<A NAME="962"></A>service."
<A NAME="963"></A><BR><BR>The Athenians, as soon as they received this message, were anxious 
<A NAME="964"></A>to go to the aid of the Spartans, and to help them to the uttermost of 
<A NAME="965"></A>their power; but, as they were upon the march, the Greeks on the king's 
<A NAME="966"></A>side, whose place in the line had been opposite theirs, fell upon them, 
<A NAME="967"></A>and so harassed them by their attacks that it was not possible for them 
<A NAME="968"></A>to give the succour they desired. Accordingly the Lacedaemonians, and the 
<A NAME="969"></A>Tegeans- whom nothing could induce to quit their side- were left alone 
<A NAME="970"></A>to resist the Persians. Including the light-armed, the number of the former 
<A NAME="971"></A>was 50,000; while that of the Tegeans was 3000. Now, therefore, as they 
<A NAME="972"></A>were about to engage with Mardonius and the troops under him, they made 
<A NAME="973"></A>ready to offer sacrifice. The victims, however, for some time were not 
<A NAME="974"></A>favourable; and, during the delay, many fell on the Spartan side, and a 
<A NAME="975"></A>still greater number were wounded. For the Persians had made a rampart 
<A NAME="976"></A>of their wicker shields, and shot from behind them stich clouds of arrows, 
<A NAME="977"></A>that the Spartans were sorely distressed. The victims continued unpropitious; 
<A NAME="978"></A>till at last Pausanias raised his eyes to the Heraeum of the Plataeans, 
<A NAME="979"></A>and calling the goddess to his aid, besought her not to disappoint the 
<A NAME="980"></A>hopes of the Greeks.
<A NAME="981"></A><BR><BR>As he offered his prayer, the Tegeans, advancing before the rest, 
<A NAME="982"></A>rushed forward against the enemy; and the Lacedaemonians, who had obtained 
<A NAME="983"></A>favourable omens the moment that Pausanias prayed, at length, after their 
<A NAME="984"></A>long delay, advanced to the attack; while the Persians, on their side, 
<A NAME="985"></A>left shooting, and prepared to meet them. And first the combat was at the 
<A NAME="986"></A>wicker shields. Afterwards, when these were swept down, a fierce contest 
<A NAME="987"></A>took Place by the side of the temple of Ceres, which lasted long, and ended 
<A NAME="988"></A>in a hand-to-hand struggle. The barbarians many times seized hold of the 
<A NAME="989"></A>Greek spears and brake them; for in boldness and warlike spirit the Persians 
<A NAME="990"></A>were not a whit inferior to the Greeks; but they were without bucklers, 
<A NAME="991"></A>untrained, and far below the enemy in respect of skill in arms. Sometimes 
<A NAME="992"></A>singly, sometimes in bodies of ten, now fewer and now more in number, they 
<A NAME="993"></A>dashed upon the Spartan ranks, and so perished.
<A NAME="994"></A><BR><BR>The fight went most against the Greeks, where Mardonius, mounted 
<A NAME="995"></A>upon a white horse, and surrounded by the bravest of all the Persians, 
<A NAME="996"></A>the thousand picked men, fought in person. So long as Mardonius was alive, 
<A NAME="997"></A>this body resisted all attacks, and, while they defended their own lives, 
<A NAME="998"></A>struck down no small number of Spartans; but after Mardonius fell, and 
<A NAME="999"></A>the troops with him, which were the main strength of the army, perished, 
<A NAME="1000"></A>the remainder yielded to the Lacedaemonians, and took to flight. Their 
<A NAME="1001"></A>light clothing, and want of bucklers, were of the greatest hurt to them: 
<A NAME="1002"></A>for they had to contend against men heavily armed, while they themselves 
<A NAME="1003"></A>were without any such defence.
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR><BR>Then was the warning of the oracle fulfilled; and the vengeance 
<A NAME="1005"></A>which was due to the Spartans for the slaughter of Leonidas was paid them 
<A NAME="1006"></A>by Mardonius- then too did Pausanias, the son of Cleombrotus, and grandson 
<A NAME="1007"></A>of Anaxandridas (I omit to recount his other ancestors, since they are 
<A NAME="1008"></A>the same with those of Leonidas), win a victory exceeding in glory all 
<A NAME="1009"></A>those to which our knowledge extends. Mardonius was slain by Aeimnestus, 
<A NAME="1010"></A>a man famous in Sparta- the same who in the Messenian war, which came after 
<A NAME="1011"></A>the struggle against the Medes, fought a battle near Stenyclerus with but 
<A NAME="1012"></A>three hundred men against the whole force of the Messenians, and himself 
<A NAME="1013"></A>perished, and the three hundred with him.
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR><BR>The Persians, as soon as they were put to flight by the Lacedaemonians, 
<A NAME="1015"></A>ran hastily away, without preserving any order, and took refuge in their 
<A NAME="1016"></A>own camp, within the wooden defence which they had raised in the Theban 
<A NAME="1017"></A>territory. It is a marvel to me how it came to pass, that although the 
<A NAME="1018"></A>battle was fought quite close to the grove of Ceres, yet not a single Persian 
<A NAME="1019"></A>appears to have died on the sacred soil, nor even to have set foot upon 
<A NAME="1020"></A>it, while round about the precinct, in the unconsecrated ground, great 
<A NAME="1021"></A>numbers perished. I imagine- if it is lawful, in matters which concern 
<A NAME="1022"></A>the gods, to imagine anything- that the goddess herself kept them out, 
<A NAME="1023"></A>because they had burnt her dwelling at Eleusis. Such, then, was the issue 
<A NAME="1024"></A>of this battle.
<A NAME="1025"></A><BR><BR>Artabazus, the son of Pharnaces, who had disapproved from the first 
<A NAME="1026"></A>of the king's leaving Mardonius behind him, and had made great endeavours, 
<A NAME="1027"></A>but all in vain, to dissuade Mardonius from risking a battle, when he found 
<A NAME="1028"></A>that the latter was bent on acting otherwise than he wished, did as follows. 
<A NAME="1029"></A>He had a force under his orders which was far from inconsiderable, amounting, 
<A NAME="1030"></A>as it did, to near forty thousand men. Being well aware, therefore, how 
<A NAME="1031"></A>the battle was likely to go, as soon as the two armies began to fight, 
<A NAME="1032"></A>he led his soldiers forward in an orderly array, bidding them one and all 
<A NAME="1033"></A>proceed at the same pace, and follow him with such celerity as they should 
<A NAME="1034"></A>observe him to use. Having issued these commands, he pretended to lead 
<A NAME="1035"></A>them to the battle. But when, advancing before his army, he saw that the 
<A NAME="1036"></A>Persians were already in flight, instead of keeping the same order, he 
<A NAME="1037"></A>wheeled his troops suddenly round, and beat a retreat; nor did he even 
<A NAME="1038"></A>seek shelter within the palisade or behind the walls of Thebes, but hurried 
<A NAME="1039"></A>on into Phocis, wishing to make his way to the Hellespont with all possible 
<A NAME="1040"></A>speed. Such accordingly was the course which these Persians 
<A NAME="1041"></A>took.
<A NAME="1042"></A><BR><BR>As for the Greeks upon the king's side, while most of them played 
<A NAME="1043"></A>the coward purposely, the Boeotians, on the contrary, had a long struggle 
<A NAME="1044"></A>with the Athenians. Those of the Thebans who were attached to the Medes, 
<A NAME="1045"></A>displayed especially no little zeal; far from playing the coward, they 
<A NAME="1046"></A>fought with such fury that three hundred of the best and bravest among 
<A NAME="1047"></A>them were slain by the Athenians in this passage of arms. But at last they 
<A NAME="1048"></A>too were routed, and fled away- not, however, in the same direction as 
<A NAME="1049"></A>the Persians and the crowd of allies, who, having taken no part in the 
<A NAME="1050"></A>battle, ran off without striking a blow- but to the city of 
<A NAME="1051"></A>Thebes.
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR><BR>To me it shows very clearly how completely the rest of the barbarians 
<A NAME="1053"></A>were dependent upon the Persian troops, that here they all fled at once, 
<A NAME="1054"></A>without ever coming to blows with the enemy, merely because they saw the 
<A NAME="1055"></A>Persians running away. And so it came to pass that the whole army took 
<A NAME="1056"></A>to flight, except only the horse, both Persian and Boeotian. These did 
<A NAME="1057"></A>good service to the flying foot-men, by advancing close to the enemy, and 
<A NAME="1058"></A>separating between the Greeks and their own fugitives.
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR><BR>The victors however pressed on, pursuing and slaying the remnant 
<A NAME="1060"></A>of the king's army.
<A NAME="1061"></A><BR><BR>Meantime, while the flight continued, tidings reached the Greeks 
<A NAME="1062"></A>who were drawn up round the Heraeum, and so were absent from the battle, 
<A NAME="1063"></A>that the fight was begun, and that Pausanias was gaining the victory. Hearing 
<A NAME="1064"></A>this, they rushed forward without any order, the Corinthians taking the 
<A NAME="1065"></A>upper road across the skirts of Cithaeron and the hills, which led straight 
<A NAME="1066"></A>to the temple of Ceres; while the Megarians and Phliasians followed the 
<A NAME="1067"></A>level route through the plain. These last had almost reached the enemy, 
<A NAME="1068"></A>when the Theban horse espied them, and, observing their disarray, despatched 
<A NAME="1069"></A>against them the squadron of which Asopodorus, the son of Timander, was 
<A NAME="1070"></A>captain. Asopodorus charged them with such effect that the left six hundred 
<A NAME="1071"></A>of their number dead upon the plain, and, pursuing the rest, compelled 
<A NAME="1072"></A>them to seek shelter in Cithaeron. So these men perished without 
<A NAME="1073"></A>honour.
<A NAME="1074"></A><BR><BR>The Persians, and the multitude with them, who fled to the wooden 
<A NAME="1075"></A>fortress, were able to ascend into the towers before the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="1076"></A>came up. Thus placed, they proceeded to strengthen the defences as well 
<A NAME="1077"></A>as they could; and when the Lacedaemonians arrived, a sharp fight took 
<A NAME="1078"></A>place at the rampart. So long as the Athenians were away, the barbarians 
<A NAME="1079"></A>kept off their assailants, and had much the best of the combat, since the 
<A NAME="1080"></A>Lacedaemonians were unskilled in the attack of walled places: but on the 
<A NAME="1081"></A>arrival of the Athenians, a more violent assault was made, and the wall 
<A NAME="1082"></A>was for a long time attacked with fury. In the end the valour of the Athenians 
<A NAME="1083"></A>and their perseverance prevailed- they gained the top of the wall, and, 
<A NAME="1084"></A>breaking a breach through it, enabled the Greeks to pour in. The first 
<A NAME="1085"></A>to enter here were the Tegeans, and they it was who plundered the tent 
<A NAME="1086"></A>of Mardonius; where among other booty the found the manger from which his 
<A NAME="1087"></A>horses ate, all made of solid brass, and well worth looking at. This manger 
<A NAME="1088"></A>was given by the Tegeans to the temple of Minerva Alea, while the remainder
