<A NAME="start"></A>
<A NAME="10"></A><B>Terpsichore</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>The Persians left behind by King Darius in Europe, who had Megabazus 
<A NAME="12"></A>for their general, reduced, before any other Hellespontine state, the people 
<A NAME="13"></A>of Perinthus, who had no mind to become subjects of the king. Now the Perinthians 
<A NAME="14"></A>had ere this been roughly handled by another nation, the Paeonians. For 
<A NAME="15"></A>the Paeonians from about the Strymon were once bidden by an oracle to make 
<A NAME="16"></A>war upon the Perinthians, and if these latter, when the camps faced one 
<A NAME="17"></A>another, challenged them by name to fight, then to venture on a battle, 
<A NAME="18"></A>but if otherwise, not to make the hazard. The Paeonians followed the advice. 
<A NAME="19"></A>Now the men of Perinthus drew out to meet them in the skirts of their city; 
<A NAME="20"></A>and a threefold single combat was fought on challenge given. Man to man, 
<A NAME="21"></A>and horse to horse, and dog to dog, was the strife waged; and the Perinthians, 
<A NAME="22"></A>winners of two combats out of the three, in their joy had raised the paean; 
<A NAME="23"></A>when the Paeonians struck by the thought that this was what the oracle 
<A NAME="24"></A>had meant, passed the word one to another, saying, "Now of a surety has 
<A NAME="25"></A>the oracle been fulfilled for us; now our work begins." Then the Paeonians 
<A NAME="26"></A>set upon the Perinthians in the midst of their paean, and defeated them 
<A NAME="27"></A>utterly, leaving but few of them alive.
<A NAME="28"></A><BR><BR>Such was the affair of the Paeonians, which happened a long time 
<A NAME="29"></A>previously. At this time the Perinthians, after a brave struggle for freedom, 
<A NAME="30"></A>were overcome by numbers, and yielded to Megabazus and his Persians. After 
<A NAME="31"></A>Perinthus had been brought under, Megabazus led his host through Thrace, 
<A NAME="32"></A>subduing to the dominion of the king all the towns and all the nations 
<A NAME="33"></A>of those parts. For the king's command to him was that he should conquer 
<A NAME="34"></A>Thrace.
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR>The Thracians are the most powerful people in the world, except, 
<A NAME="36"></A>of course, the Indians; and if they had one head, or were agreed among 
<A NAME="37"></A>themselves, it is my belief that their match could not be found anywhere, 
<A NAME="38"></A>and that they would very far surpass all other nations. But such union 
<A NAME="39"></A>is impossible for them, and there are no means of ever bringing it about. 
<A NAME="40"></A>Herein therefore consists their weakness. The Thracians bear many names 
<A NAME="41"></A>in the different regions of their country, but all of them have like usages 
<A NAME="42"></A>in every respect, excepting only the Getae, the Trausi, and those who dwell 
<A NAME="43"></A>above the people of Creston.
<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR>Now the manners and customs of the Getae, who believe in their 
<A NAME="45"></A>immortality, I have already spoken of. The Trausi in all else resemble 
<A NAME="46"></A>the other Thracians, but have customs at births and deaths which I will 
<A NAME="47"></A>now describe. When a child is born all its kindred sit round about it in 
<A NAME="48"></A>a circle and weep for the woes it will have to undergo now that it is come 
<A NAME="49"></A>into the world, making mention of every ill that falls to the lot of humankind; 
<A NAME="50"></A>when, on the other hand, a man has died, they bury him with laughter and 
<A NAME="51"></A>rejoicings, and say that now he is free from a host of sufferings, and 
<A NAME="52"></A>enjoys the completest happiness.
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR>The Thracians who live above the Crestonaeans observe the following 
<A NAME="54"></A>customs. Each man among them has several wives; and no sooner does a man 
<A NAME="55"></A>die than a sharp contest ensues among the wives upon the question which 
<A NAME="56"></A>of them all the husband loved most tenderly; the friends of each eagerly 
<A NAME="57"></A>plead on her behalf, and she to whom the honour is adjudged, after receiving 
<A NAME="58"></A>the praises both of men and women, is slain over the grave by the hand 
<A NAME="59"></A>of her next of kin, and then buried with her husband. The others are sorely 
<A NAME="60"></A>grieved, for nothing is considered such a disgrace.
<A NAME="61"></A><BR><BR>The Thracians who do not belong to these tribes have the customs 
<A NAME="62"></A>which follow. They sell their children to traders. On their maidens they 
<A NAME="63"></A>keep no watch, but leave them altogether free, while on the conduct of 
<A NAME="64"></A>their wives they keep a most strict watch. Brides are purchased of their 
<A NAME="65"></A>parents for large sums of money. Tattooing among them marks noble birth, 
<A NAME="66"></A>and the want of it low birth. To be idle is accounted the most honourable 
<A NAME="67"></A>thing, and to be a tiller of the ground the most dishonourable. To live 
<A NAME="68"></A>by war and plunder is of all things the most glorious. These are the most 
<A NAME="69"></A>remarkable of their customs.
<A NAME="70"></A><BR><BR>The gods which they worship are but three, Mars, Bacchus, and Dian. 
<A NAME="71"></A>Their kings, however, unlike the rest of the citizens, worship Mercury 
<A NAME="72"></A>more than any other god, always swearing by his name, and declaring that 
<A NAME="73"></A>they are themselves sprung from him.
<A NAME="74"></A><BR><BR>Their wealthy ones are buried in the following fashion. The body 
<A NAME="75"></A>is laid out for three days; and during this time they kill victims of all 
<A NAME="76"></A>kinds, and feast upon them, after first bewailing the departed. Then they 
<A NAME="77"></A>either burn the body or else bury it in the ground. Lastly, they raise 
<A NAME="78"></A>a mound over the grave, and hold games of all sorts, wherein the single 
<A NAME="79"></A>combat is awarded the highest prize. Such is the mode of burial among the 
<A NAME="80"></A>Thracians.
<A NAME="81"></A><BR><BR>As regards the region lying north of this country no one can say 
<A NAME="82"></A>with any certainty what men inhabit it. It appears that you no sooner cross 
<A NAME="83"></A>the Ister than you enter on an interminable wilderness. The only people 
<A NAME="84"></A>of whom I can hear as dwelling beyond the Ister are the race named Sigynnae, 
<A NAME="85"></A>who wear, they say, a dress like the Medes, and have horses which are covered 
<A NAME="86"></A>entirely with a coat of shaggy hair, five fingers in length. They are a 
<A NAME="87"></A>small breed, flat-nosed, and not strong enough to bear men on their backs; 
<A NAME="88"></A>but when yoked to chariots, they are among the swiftest known, which is 
<A NAME="89"></A>the reason why the people of that country use chariots. Their borders reach 
<A NAME="90"></A>down almost to the Eneti upon the Adriatic Sea, and they call themselves 
<A NAME="91"></A>colonists of the Medes; but how they can be colonists of the Medes I for 
<A NAME="92"></A>my part cannot imagine. Still nothing is impossible in the long lapse of 
<A NAME="93"></A>ages. Sigynnae is the name which the Ligurians who dwell above Massilia 
<A NAME="94"></A>give to traders, while among the Cyprians the word means 
<A NAME="95"></A>spears.
<A NAME="96"></A><BR><BR>According to the account which the Thracians give, the country 
<A NAME="97"></A>beyond the Ister is possessed by bees, on account of which it is impossible 
<A NAME="98"></A>to penetrate farther. But in this they seem to me to say what has no likelihood; 
<A NAME="99"></A>for it is certain that those creatures are very impatient of cold. I rather 
<A NAME="100"></A>believe that it is on account of the cold that the regions which lie under 
<A NAME="101"></A>the Bear are without inhabitants. Such then are the accounts given of this 
<A NAME="102"></A>country, the sea-coast whereof Megabazus was now employed in subjecting 
<A NAME="103"></A>to the Persians.
<A NAME="104"></A><BR><BR>King Darius had no sooner crossed the Hellespont and reached Sardis, 
<A NAME="105"></A>than he bethought himself of the good deed of Histiaeus the Milesian, and 
<A NAME="106"></A>the good counsel of the Mytilenean Coes. He therefore sent for both of 
<A NAME="107"></A>them to Sardis, and bade them each crave a boon at his hands. Now Histiaeus, 
<A NAME="108"></A>as he was already king of Miletus, did not make request for any government 
<A NAME="109"></A>besides, but asked Darius to give him Myrcinus of the Edonians, where he 
<A NAME="110"></A>wished to build him a city. Such was the choice that Histiaeus made. Coes, 
<A NAME="111"></A>on the other hand, as he was a mere burgher, and not a king, requested 
<A NAME="112"></A>the sovereignty of Mytilene. Both alike obtained their requests, and straight-way 
<A NAME="113"></A>betook themselves to the places which they had chosen.
<A NAME="114"></A><BR><BR>It chanced in the meantime that King Darius saw a sight which determined 
<A NAME="115"></A>him to bid Megabazus remove the Paeonians from their seats in Europe and 
<A NAME="116"></A>transport them to Asia. There were two Paeonians, Pigres and Mantyes, whose 
<A NAME="117"></A>ambition it was to obtain the sovereignty over their countrymen. As soon 
<A NAME="118"></A>therefore as ever Darius crossed into Asia, these men came to Sardis, and 
<A NAME="119"></A>brought with them their sister, who was a tall and beautiful woman. Having 
<A NAME="120"></A>so done, they waited till a day came when the king sat in state in the 
<A NAME="121"></A>suburb of the Lydians; and then dressing their sister in the richest gear 
<A NAME="122"></A>they could, sent her to draw water for them. She bore a pitcher upon her 
<A NAME="123"></A>head, and with one arm led a horse, while all the way as she went she span 
<A NAME="124"></A>flax. Now as she passed by where the king was, Darius took notice of her; 
<A NAME="125"></A>for it was neither like the Persians nor the Lydians, nor any of the dwellers 
<A NAME="126"></A>in Asia, to do as she did. Darius accordingly noted her, and ordered some 
<A NAME="127"></A>of his guard to follow her steps, and watch to see what she would do with 
<A NAME="128"></A>the horse. So the spearmen went; and the woman, when she came to the river, 
<A NAME="129"></A>first watered the horse, and then filling the pitcher, came back the same 
<A NAME="130"></A>way she had gone, with the pitcher of water upon her head, and the horse 
<A NAME="131"></A>dragging upon her arm, while she still kept twirling the 
<A NAME="132"></A>spindle.
<A NAME="133"></A><BR><BR>King Darius was full of wonder both at what they who had watched 
<A NAME="134"></A>the woman told him, and at what he had himself seen. So he commanded that 
<A NAME="135"></A>she should be brought before him. And the woman came; and with her appeared 
<A NAME="136"></A>her brothers, who had been watching everything a little way off. Then Darius 
<A NAME="137"></A>asked them of what nation the woman was; and the young men replied that 
<A NAME="138"></A>they were Paeonians, and she was their sister. Darius rejoined by asking, 
<A NAME="139"></A>"Who the Paeonians were, and in what part of the world they lived? and, 
<A NAME="140"></A>further, what business had brought the young men to Sardis?" Then the brothers 
<A NAME="141"></A>told him they had come to put themselves under his power, and Paeonia was 
<A NAME="142"></A>a country upon the river Strymon, and the Strymon was at no great distance 
<A NAME="143"></A>from the Hellespont. The Paeonians, they said, were colonists of the Teucrians 
<A NAME="144"></A>from Troy. When they had thus answered his questions, Darius asked if all 
<A NAME="145"></A>the women of their country worked so hard? Then the brothers eagerly answered, 
<A NAME="146"></A>Yes; for this was the very object with which the whole thing had been 
<A NAME="147"></A>done.
<A NAME="148"></A><BR><BR>So Darius wrote letters to Megabazus, the commander whom he had 
<A NAME="149"></A>left behind in Thrace, and ordered him to remove the Paeonians from their 
<A NAME="150"></A>own land, and bring them into his presence, men, women, and children. And 
<A NAME="151"></A>straightway a horseman took the message, and rode at speed to the Hellespont; 
<A NAME="152"></A>and, crossing it, gave the paper to Megabazus. Then Megabazus, as soon 
<A NAME="153"></A>as he had read it, and procured guides from Thrace, made war upon 
<A NAME="154"></A>Paeonia.
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR>Now when the Paeonians heard that the Persians were marching against 
<A NAME="156"></A>them, they gathered themselves together, and marched down to the sea-coast, 
<A NAME="157"></A>since they thought the Persians would endeavour to enter their country 
<A NAME="158"></A>on that side. Here then they stood in readiness to oppose the army of Megabazus. 
<A NAME="159"></A>But the Persians, who knew that they had collected, and were gone to keep 
<A NAME="160"></A>guard at the pass near the sea, got guides, and taking the inland route 
<A NAME="161"></A>before the Paeonians were aware, poured down upon their cities, from which 
<A NAME="162"></A>the men had all marched out; and finding them empty, easily got possession 
<A NAME="163"></A>of them. Then the men, when they heard that all their towns were taken, 
<A NAME="164"></A>scattered this way and that to their homes, and gave themselves up to the 
<A NAME="165"></A>Persians. And so these tribes of the Paeonians, to wit, the Siropaeonians, 
<A NAME="166"></A>the Paeoplians and all the others as far as Lake Prasias, were torn from 
<A NAME="167"></A>their seats and led away into Asia.
<A NAME="168"></A><BR><BR>They on the other hand who dwelt about Mount Pangaeum and in the 
<A NAME="169"></A>country of the Doberes, the Agrianians, and the Odomantians, and they likewise 
<A NAME="170"></A>who inhabited Lake Prasias, were not conquered by Megabazus. He sought 
<A NAME="171"></A>indeed to subdue the dwellers upon the lake, but could not effect his purpose. 
<A NAME="172"></A>Their manner of living is the following. Platforms supported upon tall 
<A NAME="173"></A>piles stand in the middle of the lake, which are approached from the land 
<A NAME="174"></A>by a single narrow bridge. At the first the piles which bear up the platforms 
<A NAME="175"></A>were fixed in their places by the whole body of the citizens, but since 
<A NAME="176"></A>that time the custom which has prevailed about fixing them is this:- they 
<A NAME="177"></A>are brought from a hill called Orbelus, and every man drives in three for 
<A NAME="178"></A>each wife that he marries. Now the men have all many wives apiece; and 
<A NAME="179"></A>this is the way in which they live. Each has his own hut, wherein he dwells, 
<A NAME="180"></A>upon one of the platforms, and each has also a trapdoor giving access to 
<A NAME="181"></A>the lake beneath; and their wont is to tie their baby children by the foot 
<A NAME="182"></A>with a string, to save them from rolling into the water. They feed their 
<A NAME="183"></A>horses and their other beasts upon fish, which abound in the lake to such 
<A NAME="184"></A>a degree that a man has only to open his trap-door and to let down a basket 
<A NAME="185"></A>by a rope into the water, and then to wait a very short time, when he draws 
<A NAME="186"></A>it up quite full of them. The fish are of two kinds, which they call the 
<A NAME="187"></A>paprax and the tilon.
<A NAME="188"></A><BR><BR>The Paeonians therefore- at least such of them as had been conquered- 
<A NAME="189"></A>were led away into Asia. As for Megabazus, he no sooner brought the Paeonians 
<A NAME="190"></A>under, than he sent into Macedonia an embassy of Persians, choosing for 
<A NAME="191"></A>the purpose the seven men of most note in all the army after himself. These 
<A NAME="192"></A>persons were to go to Amyntas, and require him to give earth and water 
<A NAME="193"></A>to King Darius. Now there is a very short cut from the Lake Prasias across 
<A NAME="194"></A>to Macedonia. Quite close to the lake is the mine which yielded afterwards 
<A NAME="195"></A>a talent of silver a day to Alexander; and from this mine you have only 
<A NAME="196"></A>to cross the mountain called Dysorum to find yourself in the Macedonian 
<A NAME="197"></A>territory.
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR>So the Persians sent upon this errand, when they reached the court, 
<A NAME="199"></A>and were brought into the presence of Amyntas, required him to give earth 
<A NAME="200"></A>and water to King Darius. And Amyntas not only gave them what they asked, 
<A NAME="201"></A>but also invited them to come and feast with him; after which he made ready 
<A NAME="202"></A>the board with great magnificence, and entertained the Persians in right 
<A NAME="203"></A>friendly fashion. Now when the meal was over, and they were all set to 
<A NAME="204"></A>the drinking, the Persians said-
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR>"Dear Macedonian, we Persians have a custom when we make a great 
<A NAME="206"></A>feast to bring with us to the board our wives and concubines, and make 
<A NAME="207"></A>them sit beside us. Now then, as thou hast received us so kindly, and feasted 
<A NAME="208"></A>us so handsomely, and givest moreover earth and water to King Darius, do 
<A NAME="209"></A>also after our custom in this matter."
<A NAME="210"></A><BR><BR>Then Amyntas answered- "O, Persians! we have no such custom as 
<A NAME="211"></A>this; but with us men and women are kept apart. Nevertheless, since you, 
<A NAME="212"></A>who are our lords, wish it, this also shall be granted to 
<A NAME="213"></A>you."
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR>When Amyntas had thus spoken, he bade some go and fetch the women. 
<A NAME="215"></A>And the women came at his call and took their seats in a row over against 
<A NAME="216"></A>the Persians. Then, when the Persians saw that the women were fair and 
<A NAME="217"></A>comely, they spoke again to Amyntas and said, that "what had been done 
<A NAME="218"></A>was not wise; for it had been better for the women not to have come at 
<A NAME="219"></A>all, than to come in this way, and not sit by their sides, but remain over 
<A NAME="220"></A>against them, the torment of their eyes." So Amyntas was forced to bid 
<A NAME="221"></A>the women sit side by side with the Persians. The women did as he ordered; 
<A NAME="222"></A>and then the Persians, who had drunk more than they ought, began to put 
<A NAME="223"></A>their hands on them, and one even tried to give the woman next him a 
<A NAME="224"></A>kiss.
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR>King Amyntas saw, but he kept silence, although sorely grieved, 
<A NAME="226"></A>for he greatly feared the power of the Persians. Alexander, however, Amyntas' 
<A NAME="227"></A>son, who was likewise there and witnessed the whole, being a young man 
<A NAME="228"></A>and unacquainted with suffering, could not any longer restrain himself. 
<A NAME="229"></A>He therefore, full of wrath, spake thus to Amyntas:- "Dear father, thou 
<A NAME="230"></A>art old and shouldst spare thyself. Rise up from table and go take thy 
<A NAME="231"></A>rest; do not stay out the drinking. I will remain with the guests and give 
<A NAME="232"></A>them all that is fitting."
<A NAME="233"></A><BR><BR>Amyntas, who guessed that Alexander would play some wild prank, 
<A NAME="234"></A>made answer:- "Dear son, thy words sound to me as those of one who is well 
<A NAME="235"></A>nigh on fire, and I perceive thou sendest me away that thou mayest do some 
<A NAME="236"></A>wild deed. I beseech thee make no commotion about these men, lest thou 
<A NAME="237"></A>bring us all to ruin, but bear to look calmly on what they do. For myself, 
<A NAME="238"></A>I will e'en withdraw as thou biddest me."
<A NAME="239"></A><BR><BR>Amyntas, when he had thus besought his son, went out; and Alexander 
<A NAME="240"></A>said to the Persians, "Look on these ladies as your own, dear strangers, 
<A NAME="241"></A>all or any of them- only tell us your wishes. But now, as the evening wears, 
<A NAME="242"></A>and I see you have all had wine enough, let them, if you please, retire, 
<A NAME="243"></A>and when they have bathed they shall come back again." To this the Persians 
<A NAME="244"></A>agreed, and Alexander, having got the women away, sent them off to the 
<A NAME="245"></A>harem, and made ready in their room an equal number of beardless youths, 
<A NAME="246"></A>whom he dressed in the garments of the women, and then, arming them with 
<A NAME="247"></A>daggers, brought them in to the Persians, saying as he introduced them, 
<A NAME="248"></A>"Methinks, dear Persians, that your entertainment has fallen short in nothing. 
<A NAME="249"></A>We have set before you all that we had ourselves in store, and all that 
<A NAME="250"></A>we could anywhere find to give you- and now, to crown the whole, we make 
<A NAME="251"></A>over to you our sisters and our mothers, that you may perceive yourselves 
<A NAME="252"></A>to be entirely honoured by us, even as you deserve to be- and also that 
<A NAME="253"></A>you may take back word to the king who sent you here, that there was one 
<A NAME="254"></A>man, a Greek, the satrap of Macedonia, by whom you were both feasted and 
<A NAME="255"></A>lodged handsomely." So speaking, Alexander set by the side of each Persian 
<A NAME="256"></A>one of those whom he had called Macedonian women, but who were in truth 
<A NAME="257"></A>men. And these men, when the Persians began to be rude, despatched them 
<A NAME="258"></A>with their daggers.
<A NAME="259"></A><BR><BR>So the ambassadors perished by this death, both they and also their 
<A NAME="260"></A>followers. For the Persians had brought a great train with them, carriages, 
<A NAME="261"></A>and attendants, and baggage of every kind- all of which disappeared at 
<A NAME="262"></A>the same time as the men themselves. Not very long afterwards the Persians 
<A NAME="263"></A>made strict search for their lost embassy; but Alexander, with much wisdom, 
<A NAME="264"></A>hushed up the business, bribing those sent on the errand, partly with money, 
<A NAME="265"></A>and partly with the gift of his own sister Gygaea, whom he gave in marriage 
<A NAME="266"></A>to Bubares, a Persian, the chief leader of the expedition which came in 
<A NAME="267"></A>search of the lost men. Thus the death of these Persians was hushed up, 
<A NAME="268"></A>and no more was said of it.
<A NAME="269"></A><BR><BR>Now that the men of this family are Greeks, sprung from Perdiccas, 
<A NAME="270"></A>as they themselves affirm, is a thing which I can declare of my own knowledge, 
<A NAME="271"></A>and which I will hereafter make plainly evident. That they are so has been 
<A NAME="272"></A>already adjudged by those who manage the Pan-Hellenic contest at Olympia. 
<A NAME="273"></A>For when Alexander wished to contend in the games, and had come to Olympia 
<A NAME="274"></A>with no other view, the Greeks who were about to run against him would 
<A NAME="275"></A>have excluded him from the contest- saying that Greeks only were allowed 
<A NAME="276"></A>to contend, and not barbarians. But Alexander proved himself to be an Argive, 
<A NAME="277"></A>and was distinctly adjudged a Greek; after which he entered the lists for 
<A NAME="278"></A>the foot-race, and was drawn to run in the first pair. Thus was this matter 
<A NAME="279"></A>settled.
<A NAME="280"></A><BR><BR>Megabazus, having reached the Hellespont with the Paeonians, crossed 
<A NAME="281"></A>it, and went up to Sardis. He had become aware while in Europe that Histiaeus 
<A NAME="282"></A>the Milesian was raising a wall at Myrcinus- the town upon the Strymon 
<A NAME="283"></A>which he had obtained from King Darius as his guerdon for keeping the bridge. 
<A NAME="284"></A>No sooner therefore did he reach Sardis with the Paeonians than he said 
<A NAME="285"></A>to Darius, "What mad thing is this that thou hast done, sire, to let a 
<A NAME="286"></A>Greek, a wise man and a shrewd, get hold of a town in Thrace, a place too 
<A NAME="287"></A>where there is abundance of timber fit for shipbuilding, and oars in plenty, 
<A NAME="288"></A>and mines of silver, and about which are many dwellers both Greek and barbarian, 
<A NAME="289"></A>ready enough to take him for their chief, and by day and night to do his 
<A NAME="290"></A>bidding! I pray thee make this man cease his work, if thou wouldest not 
<A NAME="291"></A>be entangled in a war with thine own followers. Stop him, but with a gentle 
<A NAME="292"></A>message, only bidding him to come to thee. Then when thou once hast him 
<A NAME="293"></A>in thy power, be sure thou take good care that he never get back to Greece 
<A NAME="294"></A>again."
<A NAME="295"></A><BR><BR>With these words Megabazus easily persuaded Darius, who thought 
<A NAME="296"></A>he had shown true foresight in this matter. Darius therefore sent a messenger 
<A NAME="297"></A>to Myrcinus, who said, "These be the words of the king to thee, O Histiaeus! 
<A NAME="298"></A>I have looked to find a man well affectioned towards me and towards my 
<A NAME="299"></A>greatness; and I have found none whom I can trust like thee. Thy deeds, 
<A NAME="300"></A>and not thy words only, have proved thy love for me. Now then, since I 
<A NAME="301"></A>have a mighty enterprise in hand, I pray thee come to me, that I may show 
<A NAME="302"></A>thee what I purpose!"
<A NAME="303"></A><BR><BR>Histiaeus, when he heard this, put faith in the words of the messenger; 
<A NAME="304"></A>and, as it seemed to him a grand thing to be the king's counsellor, he 
<A NAME="305"></A>straightway went up to Sardis. Then Darius, when he was come, said to him, 
<A NAME="306"></A>"Dear Histiaeus, hear why I have sent for thee. No sooner did I return 
<A NAME="307"></A>from Scythia, and lose thee out of my sight, than I longed, as I have never 
<A NAME="308"></A>longed for aught else, to behold thee once more, and to interchange speech 
<A NAME="309"></A>with thee. Right sure I am there is nothing in all the world so precious 
<A NAME="310"></A>as a friend who is at once wise and true: both which thou art, as I have 
<A NAME="311"></A>had good proof in what thou hast already done for me. Now then 'tis well 
<A NAME="312"></A>thou art come; for look, I have an offer to make to thee. Let go Miletus 
<A NAME="313"></A>and thy newly-founded town in Thrace, and come with me up to Susa; share 
<A NAME="314"></A>all that I have; live with me, and be my counsellor.
<A NAME="315"></A><BR><BR>When Darius had thus spoken he made Artaphernes, his brother by 
<A NAME="316"></A>the father's side, governor of Sardis, and taking Histiaeus with him, went 
<A NAME="317"></A>up to Susa. He left as general of all the troops upon the sea-coast Otanes, 
<A NAME="318"></A>son of Sisamnes, whose father King Cambyses slew and flayed, because that 
<A NAME="319"></A>he, being of the number of the royal judges, had taken money to give an 
<A NAME="320"></A>unrighteous sentence. Therefore Cambyses slew and flayed Sisamnes, and 
<A NAME="321"></A>cutting his skin into strips, stretched them across the seat of the throne 
<A NAME="322"></A>whereon he had been wont to sit when he heard causes. Having so done Cambyses 
<A NAME="323"></A>appointed the son of Sisamnes to be judge in his father's room, and bade 
<A NAME="324"></A>him never forget in what way his seat was cushioned.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR>Accordingly this Otanes, who had occupied so strange a throne, 
<A NAME="326"></A>became the successor of Megabazus in his command, and took first of all 
<A NAME="327"></A>Byzantium and Chalcidon, then Antandrus in the Troas, and next Lamponium. 
<A NAME="328"></A>This done, he borrowed ships of the Lesbians, and took Lemnos and Imbrus, 
<A NAME="329"></A>which were still inhabited by Pelasgians.
<A NAME="330"></A><BR><BR>Now the Lemnians stood on their defence, and fought gallantly; 
<A NAME="331"></A>but they were brought low in course of time. Such as outlived the struggle 
<A NAME="332"></A>were placed by the Persians under the government of Lycaretus, the brother 
<A NAME="333"></A>of that Maeandrius who was tyrant of Samos. (This Lycaretus died afterwards 
<A NAME="334"></A>in his government.) The cause which Otanes alleged for conquering and enslaving 
<A NAME="335"></A>all these nations was that some had refused to join the king's army against 
<A NAME="336"></A>Scythia, while others had molested the host on its return. Such were the 
<A NAME="337"></A>exploits which Otanes performed in his command.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR>Afterwards, but for no long time, there was a respite from suffering. 
<A NAME="339"></A>Then from Naxos and Miletus troubles gathered anew about Ionia. Now Naxos 
<A NAME="340"></A>at this time surpassed all the other islands in prosperity, and Miletus 
<A NAME="341"></A>had reached the height of her power, and was the glory of Ionia. But previously 
<A NAME="342"></A>for two generations the Milesians had suffered grievously from civil disorders, 
<A NAME="343"></A>which were composed by the Parians, whom the Milesians chose before all 
<A NAME="344"></A>the rest of the Greeks to rearrange their government.
<A NAME="345"></A><BR><BR>Now the way in which the Parians healed their differences was the 
<A NAME="346"></A>following. A number of the chief Parians came to Miletus, and when they 
<A NAME="347"></A>saw in how ruined a condition the Milesians were, they said that they would 
<A NAME="348"></A>like first to go over their country. So they went through all Milesia, 
<A NAME="349"></A>and on their way, whenever they saw in the waste and desolate country any 
<A NAME="350"></A>land that was well farmed, they took down the names of the owners in their 
<A NAME="351"></A>tablets; and having thus gone through the whole region, and obtained after 
<A NAME="352"></A>all but few names, they called the people together on their return to Miletus, 
<A NAME="353"></A>and made proclamation that they gave the government into the hands of those 
<A NAME="354"></A>persons whose lands they had found well farmed; for they thought it likely 
<A NAME="355"></A>(they said) that the same persons who had managed their own affairs well 
<A NAME="356"></A>would likewise conduct aright the business of the state. The other Milesians, 
<A NAME="357"></A>who in time past had been at variance, they placed under the rule of these 
<A NAME="358"></A>men. Thus was the Milesian government set in order by the 
<A NAME="359"></A>Parians.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR>It was, however, from the two cities above mentioned that troubles 
<A NAME="361"></A>began now to gather again about Ionia; and this is the way in which they 
<A NAME="362"></A>arose. Certain of the rich men had been banished from Naxos by the commonalty, 
<A NAME="363"></A>and, upon their banishment, had fled to Miletus. Aristagoras, son of Molpagoras, 
<A NAME="364"></A>the nephew and likewise the son-in-law of Histiaeus, son of Lysagoras, 
<A NAME="365"></A>who was still kept by Darius at Susa, happened to be regent of Miletus 
<A NAME="366"></A>at the time of their coming. For the kingly power belonged to Histiaeus; 
<A NAME="367"></A>but he was at Susa when the Naxians came. Now these Naxians had in times 
<A NAME="368"></A>past been bond-friends of Histiaeus; and so on their arrival at Miletus 
<A NAME="369"></A>they addressed themselves to Aristagoras and begged him to lend them such 
<A NAME="370"></A>aid as his ability allowed, in hopes thereby to recover their country. 
<A NAME="371"></A>Then Aristagoras, considering with himself that, if the Naxians should 
<A NAME="372"></A>be restored by his help, he would be lord of Naxos, put forward the friendship 
<A NAME="373"></A>with Histiaeus to cloak his views, and spoke as follows:-
<A NAME="374"></A><BR><BR>"I cannot engage to furnish you with such a power as were needful 
<A NAME="375"></A>to force you, against their will, upon the Naxians who hold the city; for 
<A NAME="376"></A>I know they can bring into the field eight thousand bucklers, and have 
<A NAME="377"></A>also a vast number of ships of war. But I will do all that lies in my power 
<A NAME="378"></A>to get you some aid, and I think I can manage it in this way. Artaphernes 
<A NAME="379"></A>happens to be my friend. Now he is a son of Hystaspes, and brother to King 
<A NAME="380"></A>Darius. All the sea-coast of Asia is under him, and he has a numerous army 
<A NAME="381"></A>and numerous ships. I think I can prevail on him to do what we 
<A NAME="382"></A>require."
<A NAME="383"></A><BR><BR>When the Naxians heard this, they empowered Aristagoras to manage 
<A NAME="384"></A>the matter for them as well as he could, and told him to promise gifts 
<A NAME="385"></A>and pay for the soldiers, which (they said) they would readily furnish, 
<A NAME="386"></A>since they had great hope that the Naxians, so soon as they saw them returned, 
<A NAME="387"></A>would render them obedience, and likewise the other islanders. For at that 
<A NAME="388"></A>time not one of the Cyclades was subject to King Darius.
<A NAME="389"></A><BR><BR>So Aristagoras went to Sardis and told Artaphernes that Naxos was 
<A NAME="390"></A>an island of no great size, but a fair land and fertile, lying near Ionia, 
<A NAME="391"></A>and containing much treasure and a vast number of slaves. "Make war then 
<A NAME="392"></A>upon this land (he said) and reinstate the exiles; for if thou wilt do 
<A NAME="393"></A>this, first of all, I have very rich gifts in store for thee (besides the 
<A NAME="394"></A>cost of the armament, which it is fair that we who are the authors of the 
<A NAME="395"></A>war should pay); and, secondly, thou wilt bring under the power of the 
<A NAME="396"></A>king not only Naxos but the other islands which depend on it, as Paros, 
<A NAME="397"></A>Andros, and all the rest of the Cyclades. And when thou hast gained these, 
<A NAME="398"></A>thou mayest easily go on against Euboea, which is a large and wealthy island 
<A NAME="399"></A>not less in size than Cyprus, and very easy to bring under. A hundred ships 
<A NAME="400"></A>were quite enough to subdue the whole." The other answered- "Truly thou 
<A NAME="401"></A>art the author of a plan which may much advantage the house of the king, 
<A NAME="402"></A>and thy counsel is good in all points except the number of the ships. Instead 
<A NAME="403"></A>of a hundred, two hundred shall be at thy disposal when the spring comes. 
<A NAME="404"></A>But the king himself must first approve the undertaking."
<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR>When Aristagoras heard this he was greatly rejoiced, and went home 
<A NAME="406"></A>in good heart to Miletus. And Artaphernes, after he had sent a messenger 
<A NAME="407"></A>to Susa to lay the plans of Aristagoras before the king, and received his 
<A NAME="408"></A>approval of the undertaking, made ready a fleet of two hundred triremes 
<A NAME="409"></A>and a vast army of Persians and their confederates. The command of these 
<A NAME="410"></A>he gave to a Persian named Megabates, who belonged to the house of the 
<A NAME="411"></A>Achaemenids, being nephew both to himself and to King Darius. It was to 
<A NAME="412"></A>a daughter of this man that Pausanias the Lacedaemonian, the son of Cleombrotus 
<A NAME="413"></A>(if at least there be any truth in the tale), was allianced many years 
<A NAME="414"></A>afterwards, when he conceived the desire of becoming tyrant of Greece. 
<A NAME="415"></A>Artaphernes now, having named Megabates to the command, sent forward the 
<A NAME="416"></A>armament to Aristagoras.
<A NAME="417"></A><BR><BR>Megabates set sail, and, touching at Miletus, took on board Aristagoras 
<A NAME="418"></A>with the Ionian troops and the Naxians; after which he steered, as he gave 
<A NAME="419"></A>out, for the Hellespont; and when he reached Chios, he brought the fleet 
<A NAME="420"></A>to anchor off Caucasa, being minded to wait there for a north wind, and 
<A NAME="421"></A>then sail straight to Naxos. The Naxians however were not to perish at 
<A NAME="422"></A>this time; and so the following events were brought about. As Megabates 
<A NAME="423"></A>went his rounds to visit the watches on board the ships, he found a Myndian 
<A NAME="424"></A>vessel upon which there was none set. Full of anger at such carelessness, 
<A NAME="425"></A>he bade his guards to seek out the captain, one Scylax by name, and thrusting 
<A NAME="426"></A>him through one of the holes in the ship's side, to fasten him there in 
<A NAME="427"></A>such a way that his head might show outside the vessel, while his body 
<A NAME="428"></A>remained within. When Scylax was thus fastened, one went and informed Aristagoras 
<A NAME="429"></A>that Megabates had bound his Myndian friend and was entreating him shamefully. 
<A NAME="430"></A>So he came and asked Megabates to let the man off; but the Persian refused 
<A NAME="431"></A>him; whereupon Aristagoras went himself and set Scylax free. When Megabates 
<A NAME="432"></A>heard this he was still more angry than before, and spoke hotly to Aristagoras. 
<A NAME="433"></A>Then the latter said to him-
<A NAME="434"></A><BR><BR>"What has thou to do with these matters? Wert thou not sent here 
<A NAME="435"></A>by Artaphernes to obey me, and to sail whithersoever I ordered? Why dost 
<A NAME="436"></A>meddle so?
<A NAME="437"></A><BR><BR>Thus spake Aristagoras. The other, in high dudgeon at such language, 
<A NAME="438"></A>waited till the night, and then despatched a boat to Naxos, to warn the 
<A NAME="439"></A>Naxians of the coming danger.
<A NAME="440"></A><BR><BR>Now the Naxians up to this time had not had any suspicion that 
<A NAME="441"></A>the armament was directed against them; as soon, therefore, as the message 
<A NAME="442"></A>reached them, forthwith they brought within their walls all that they had 
<A NAME="443"></A>in the open field, and made themselves ready against a siege by provisioning 
<A NAME="444"></A>their town both with food and drink. Thus was Naxos placed in a posture 
<A NAME="445"></A>of defence; and the Persians, when they crossed the sea from Chios, found 
<A NAME="446"></A>the Naxians fully prepared for them. However they sat down before the place, 
<A NAME="447"></A>and besieged it for four whole months. When at length all the stores which 
<A NAME="448"></A>they had brought with them were exhausted, and Aristagoras had likewise 
<A NAME="449"></A>spent upon the siege no small sum from his private means, and more was 
<A NAME="450"></A>still needed to insure success, the Persians gave up the attempt, and first 
<A NAME="451"></A>building certain forts, wherein they left the banished Naxians, withdrew 
<A NAME="452"></A>to the mainland, having utterly failed in their undertaking.
<A NAME="453"></A><BR><BR>And now Aristagoras found himself quite unable to make good his 
<A NAME="454"></A>promises to Artaphernes; nay, he was even hard pressed to meet the claims 
<A NAME="455"></A>whereto he was liable for the pay of the troops; and at the same time his 
<A NAME="456"></A>fear was great, lest, owing to the failure of the expedition and his own 
<A NAME="457"></A>quarrel with Megabates, he should be ousted from the government of Miletus. 
<A NAME="458"></A>These manifold alarms had already caused him to contemplate raising a rebellion, 
<A NAME="459"></A>when the man with the marked head came from Susa, bringing him instructions 
<A NAME="460"></A>on the part of Histiaeus to revolt from the king. For Histiaeus, when he 
<A NAME="461"></A>was anxious to give Aristagoras orders to revolt, could find but one safe 
<A NAME="462"></A>way, as the roads were guarded, of making his wishes known; which was by 
<A NAME="463"></A>taking the trustiest of his slaves, shaving all the hair from off his head, 
<A NAME="464"></A>and then pricking letters upon the skin, and waiting till the hair grew 
<A NAME="465"></A>again. Thus accordingly he did; and as soon as ever the hair was grown, 
<A NAME="466"></A>he despatched the man to Miletus, giving him no other message than this- 
<A NAME="467"></A>"When thou art come to Miletus, bid Aristagoras shave thy head, and look 
<A NAME="468"></A>thereon." Now the marks on the head, as I have already mentioned, were 
<A NAME="469"></A>a command to revolt. All this Histiaeus did because it irked him greatly 
<A NAME="470"></A>to be kept at Susa, and because he had strong hopes that, if troubles broke 
<A NAME="471"></A>out, he would be sent down to the coast to quell them, whereas, if Miletus 
<A NAME="472"></A>made no movement, he did not see a chance of his ever again returning 
<A NAME="473"></A>thither.
<A NAME="474"></A><BR><BR>Such, then, were the views which led Histiaeus to despatch his 
<A NAME="475"></A>messenger; and it so chanced that all these several motives to revolt were 
<A NAME="476"></A>brought to bear upon Aristagoras at one and the same 
<A NAME="477"></A>time.
<A NAME="478"></A><BR><BR>Accordingly, at this conjuncture Aristagoras held a council of 
<A NAME="479"></A>his trusty friends, and laid the business before them, telling them both 
<A NAME="480"></A>what he had himself purposed, and what message had been sent him by Histiaeus. 
<A NAME="481"></A>At this council all his friends were of the same way of thinking, and recommended 
<A NAME="482"></A>revolt, except only Hecataeus the historian. He, first of all, advised 
<A NAME="483"></A>them by all means to avoid engaging in war with the king of the Persians, 
<A NAME="484"></A>whose might he set forth, and whose subject nations he enumerated. As however 
<A NAME="485"></A>he could not induce them to listen to this counsel, he next advised that 
<A NAME="486"></A>they should do all that lay in their power to make themselves masters of 
<A NAME="487"></A>the sea. "There was one only way," he said, "so far as he could see, of 
<A NAME="488"></A>their succeeding in this. Miletus was, he knew, a weak state- but if the 
<A NAME="489"></A>treasures in the temple at Branchidae, which Croesus the Lydian gave to 
<A NAME="490"></A>it, were seized, he had strong hopes that the mastery of the sea might 
<A NAME="491"></A>be thereby gained; at least it would give them money to begin the war, 
<A NAME="492"></A>and would save the treasures from falling into the hands of the enemy." 
<A NAME="493"></A>Now these treasures were of very great value, as I showed in the first 
<A NAME="494"></A>part of my History. The assembly, however, rejected the counsel of Hecataeus, 
<A NAME="495"></A>while, nevertheless, they resolved upon a revolt. One of their number, 
<A NAME="496"></A>it was agreed, should sail to Myus, where the fleet had been lying since 
<A NAME="497"></A>its return from Naxos, and endeavour to seize the captains who had gone 
<A NAME="498"></A>there with the vessels.
<A NAME="499"></A><BR><BR>Iatragoras accordingly was despatched on this errand, and he took 
<A NAME="500"></A>with guile Oliatus the son of Ibanolis the Mylassian, and Histiaeus the 
<A NAME="501"></A>son of Tymnes the Termerean-Coes likewise, the son of Erxander, to whom 
<A NAME="502"></A>Darius gave Mytilene, and Aristagoras the son of Heraclides the Cymaean, 
<A NAME="503"></A>and also many others. Thus Aristagoras revolted openly from Darius; and 
<A NAME="504"></A>now he set to work to scheme against him in every possible way. First of 
<A NAME="505"></A>all, in order to induce the Milesians to join heartily in the revolt, he 
<A NAME="506"></A>gave out that he laid down his own lordship over Miletus, and in lieu thereof 
<A NAME="507"></A>established a commonwealth: after which, throughout all Ionia he did the 
<A NAME="508"></A>like; for from some of the cities he drove out their tyrants, and to others, 
<A NAME="509"></A>whose goodwill he hoped thereby to gain, he handed theirs over, thus giving 
<A NAME="510"></A>up all the men whom he had seized at the Naxian fleet, each to the city 
<A NAME="511"></A>whereto he belonged.
<A NAME="512"></A><BR><BR>Now the Mytileneans had no sooner got Coes into their power, than 
<A NAME="513"></A>they led him forth from the city and stoned him; the Cymaeans, on the other 
<A NAME="514"></A>hand, allowed their tyrant to go free; as likewise did most of the others. 
<A NAME="515"></A>And so this form of government ceased throughout all the cities. Aristagoras 
<A NAME="516"></A>the Milesian, after he had in this way put down the tyrants, and bidden 
<A NAME="517"></A>the cities choose themselves captains in their room, sailed away himself 
<A NAME="518"></A>on board a trireme to Lacedaemon; for he had great need of obtaining the 
<A NAME="519"></A>aid of some powerful ally.
<A NAME="520"></A><BR><BR>At Sparta, Anaxandridas the son of Leo was no longer king: he had 
<A NAME="521"></A>died, and his son Cleomenes had mounted the throne, not however by right 
<A NAME="522"></A>of merit, but of birth. Anaxandridas took to wife his own sister's daughter, 
<A NAME="523"></A>and was tenderly attached to her; but no children came from the marriage. 
<A NAME="524"></A>Hereupon the Ephors called him before them, and said- "If thou hast no 
<A NAME="525"></A>care for thine own self, nevertheless we cannot allow this, nor suffer 
<A NAME="526"></A>the race of Eurysthenes to die out from among us. Come then, as thy present 
<A NAME="527"></A>wife bears thee no children, put her away, and wed another. So wilt thou 
<A NAME="528"></A>do what is well-pleasing to the Spartans." Anaxandridas however refused 
<A NAME="529"></A>to do as they required, and said it was no good advice the Ephors gave, 
<A NAME="530"></A>to bid him put away his wife when she had done no wrong, and take to himself 
<A NAME="531"></A>another. He therefore declined to obey them.
<A NAME="532"></A><BR><BR>Then the Ephors and Elders took counsel together, and laid this 
<A NAME="533"></A>proposal before the king:- "Since thou art so fond, as we see thee to be, 
<A NAME="534"></A>of thy present wife, do what we now advise, and gainsay us not, lest the 
<A NAME="535"></A>Spartans make some unwonted decree concerning thee. We ask thee not now 
<A NAME="536"></A>to put away thy wife to whom thou art married- give her still the same 
<A NAME="537"></A>love and honour as ever- but take thee another wife beside, who may bear 
<A NAME="538"></A>thee children."
<A NAME="539"></A><BR><BR>When he heard this offer, Anaxandridas gave way- and henceforth 
<A NAME="540"></A>he lived with two wives in two separate houses, quite against all Spartan 
<A NAME="541"></A>custom.
<A NAME="542"></A><BR><BR>In a short time, the wife whom he had last married bore him a son, 
<A NAME="543"></A>who received the name of Cleomenes; and so the heir to the throne was brought 
<A NAME="544"></A>into the world by her. After this, the first wife also, who in time past 
<A NAME="545"></A>had been barren, by some strange chance conceived, and came to be with 
<A NAME="546"></A>child. Then the friends of the second wife, when they heard a rumour of 
<A NAME="547"></A>the truth, made a great stir, and said it was a false boast, and she meant, 
<A NAME="548"></A>they were sure, to bring forward as her own a supposititious child. So 
<A NAME="549"></A>they raised an outcry against her; and therefore, when her full time was 
<A NAME="550"></A>come, the Ephors, who were themselves incredulous, sat round her bed, and 
<A NAME="551"></A>kept a strict watch on the labour. At this time then she bore Dorieus, 
<A NAME="552"></A>and after him, quickly, Leonidas, and after him, again quickly, Cleombrotus. 
<A NAME="553"></A>Some even say that Leonidas and Cleombrotus were twins. On the other hand, 
<A NAME="554"></A>the second wife, the mother of Cleomenes (who was a daughter of Prinetadas, 
<A NAME="555"></A>the son of Demarmenus), never gave birth to a second 
<A NAME="556"></A>child.
<A NAME="557"></A><BR><BR>Now Cleomenes, it is said, was not right in his mind; indeed he 
<A NAME="558"></A>verged upon madness; while Dorieus surpassed all his co-mates, and looked 
<A NAME="559"></A>confidently to receiving the kingdom on the score of merit. When, therefore, 
<A NAME="560"></A>after the death of Anaxandridas, the Spartans kept to the law, and made 
<A NAME="561"></A>Cleomenes, his eldest son, king in his room, Dorieus, who had imagined 
<A NAME="562"></A>that he should be chosen, and who could not bear the thought of having 
<A NAME="563"></A>such a man as Cleomenes to rule over him, asked the Spartans to give him 
<A NAME="564"></A>a body of men, and left Sparta with them in order to found a colony. However, 
<A NAME="565"></A>he neither took counsel of the oracle at Delphi as to the place whereto 
<A NAME="566"></A>he should go, nor observed any of the customary usages; but left Sparta 
<A NAME="567"></A>in dudgeon, and sailed away to Libya, under the guidance of certain men 
<A NAME="568"></A>who were Theraeans. These men brought him to Cinyps, where he colonised 
<A NAME="569"></A>a spot, which has not its equal in all Libya, on the banks of a river: 
<A NAME="570"></A>but from this place he was driven in the third year by the Macians, the 
<A NAME="571"></A>Libyans, and the Carthaginians.
<A NAME="572"></A><BR><BR>Dorieus returned to the Peloponnese; whereupon Antichares the Eleonian 
<A NAME="573"></A>gave him a counsel (which he got from the oracle of Laius), to "found the 
<A NAME="574"></A>city of Heraclea in Sicily; the whole country of Eryx belonged," he said, 
<A NAME="575"></A>"to the Heracleids, since Hercules himself conquered it." On receiving 
<A NAME="576"></A>this advice, Dorieus went to Delphi to inquire of the oracle whether he 
<A NAME="577"></A>would take the place to which he was about to go. The Pythoness prophesied 
<A NAME="578"></A>that he would; whereupon Dorieus went back to Libya, took up the men who 
<A NAME="579"></A>had sailed with him at the first, and proceeded upon his way along the 
<A NAME="580"></A>shores of Italy.
<A NAME="581"></A><BR><BR>Just at this time, the Sybarites say, they and their king Telys 
<A NAME="582"></A>were about to make war upon Crotona, and the Crotoniats, greatly alarmed, 
<A NAME="583"></A>besought Dorieus to lend them aid. Dorieus was prevailed upon, bore part 
<A NAME="584"></A>in the war against Sybaris, and had a share in taking the town. Such is 
<A NAME="585"></A>the account which the Sybarites give of what was done by Dorieus and his 
<A NAME="586"></A>companions. The Crotoniats, on the other hand, maintain that no foreigner 
<A NAME="587"></A>lent them aid in their war against the Sybarites, save and except Callias 
<A NAME="588"></A>the Elean, a soothsayer of the race of the Iamidae; and he only forsook 
<A NAME="589"></A>Telys the Sybaritic king, and deserted to their side, when he found on 
<A NAME="590"></A>sacrificing that the victims were not favourable to an attack on Crotona. 
<A NAME="591"></A>Such is the account which each party gives of these 
<A NAME="592"></A>matters.
<A NAME="593"></A><BR><BR>Both parties likewise adduce testimonies to the truth of what they 
<A NAME="594"></A>say. The Sybarites show a temple and sacred precinct near the dry stream 
<A NAME="595"></A>of the Crastis, which they declare that Dorieus, after taking their city, 
<A NAME="596"></A>dedicated to Minerva Crastias. And further, they bring forward the death 
<A NAME="597"></A>of Dorieus as the surest proof; since he fell, they say, because he disobeyed 
<A NAME="598"></A>the oracle. For had he in nothing varied from the directions given him, 
<A NAME="599"></A>but confined himself to the business on which he was sent, he would assuredly 
<A NAME="600"></A>have conquered the Erycian territory, and kept possession of it, instead 
<A NAME="601"></A>of perishing with all his followers. The Crotoniats, on the other hand, 
<A NAME="602"></A>point to the numerous allotments within their borders which were assigned 
<A NAME="603"></A>to Callias the Elean by their countrymen, and which to my day remained 
<A NAME="604"></A>in the possession of his family; while Dorieus and his descendants (they 
<A NAME="605"></A>remark) possess nothing. Yet if Dorieus had really helped them in the Sybaritic 
<A NAME="606"></A>war, he would have received very much more than Callias. Such are the testimonies 
<A NAME="607"></A>which are adduced on either side; it is open to every man to adopt whichever 
<A NAME="608"></A>view he deems the best.
<A NAME="609"></A><BR><BR>Certain Spartans accompanied Dorieus on his voyage as co-founders, 
<A NAME="610"></A>to wit, Thessalus, Paraebates, Celeas, and Euryleon. These men and all 
<A NAME="611"></A>the troops under their command reached Sicily; but there they fell in a 
<A NAME="612"></A>battle wherein they were defeated by the Egestaeans and Phoenicians, only 
<A NAME="613"></A>one, Euryleon, surviving the disaster. He then, collecting the remnants 
<A NAME="614"></A>of the beaten army, made himself master of Minoa, the Selinusian colony, 
<A NAME="615"></A>and helped the Selinusians to throw off the yoke of their tyrant Peithagoras. 
<A NAME="616"></A>Having upset Peithagoras, he sought to become tyrant in his room, and he 
<A NAME="617"></A>even reigned at Selinus for a brief space- but after a while the Selinusians 
<A NAME="618"></A>rose up in revolt against him, and though he fled to the altar of Jupiter 
<A NAME="619"></A>Agoraeus, they notwithstanding put him to death.
<A NAME="620"></A><BR><BR>Another man who accompanied Dorieus, and died with him, was Philip 
<A NAME="621"></A>the son of Butacidas, a man of Crotona; who, after he had been betrothed 
<A NAME="622"></A>to a daughter of Telys the Sybarite, was banished from Crotona, whereupon 
<A NAME="623"></A>his marriage came to nought; and he in his disappointment took ship and 
<A NAME="624"></A>sailed to Cyrene. From thence he became a follower of Dorieus, furnishing 
<A NAME="625"></A>to the fleet a trireme of his own, the crew of which he supported at his 
<A NAME="626"></A>own charge. This Philip was an Olympian victor, and the handsomest Greek 
<A NAME="627"></A>of his day. His beauty gained him honours at the hands of the Egestaeans 
<A NAME="628"></A>which they never accorded to any one else; for they raised a hero-temple 
<A NAME="629"></A>over his grave, and they still worship him with sacrifices.
<A NAME="630"></A><BR><BR>Such then was the end of Dorieus, who if he had brooked the rule 
<A NAME="631"></A>of Cleomenes, and remained in Sparta, would have been king of Lacedaemon; 
<A NAME="632"></A>since Cleomenes, after reigning no great length of time, died without male 
<A NAME="633"></A>offspring, leaving behind him an only daughter, by name 
<A NAME="634"></A>Gorgo.
<A NAME="635"></A><BR><BR>Cleomenes, however, was still king when Aristagoras, tyrant of 
<A NAME="636"></A>Miletus, reached Sparta. At their interview, Aristagoras, according to 
<A NAME="637"></A>the report of the Lacedaemonians, produced a bronze tablet, whereupon the 
<A NAME="638"></A>whole circuit of the earth was engraved, with all its seas and rivers. 
<A NAME="639"></A>Discourse began between the two; and Aristagoras addressed the Spartan 
<A NAME="640"></A>king in these words following:- "Think it not strange, O King Cleomenes, 
<A NAME="641"></A>that I have been at the pains to sail hither; for the posture of affairs, 
<A NAME="642"></A>which I will now recount unto thee, made it fitting. Shame and grief is 
<A NAME="643"></A>it indeed to none so much as to us, that the sons of the Ionians should 
<A NAME="644"></A>have lost their freedom, and come to be the slaves of others; but yet it 
<A NAME="645"></A>touches you likewise, O Spartans, beyond the rest of the Greeks, inasmuch 
<A NAME="646"></A>as the pre-eminence over all Greece appertains to you. We beseech you, 
<A NAME="647"></A>therefore, by the common gods of the Grecians, deliver the Ionians, who 
<A NAME="648"></A>are your own kinsmen, from slavery. Truly the task is not difficult; for 
<A NAME="649"></A>the barbarians are an unwarlike people; and you are the best and bravest 
<A NAME="650"></A>warriors in the whole world. Their mode of fighting is the following:- 
<A NAME="651"></A>they use bows and arrows and a short spear; they wear trousers in the field, 
<A NAME="652"></A>and cover their heads with turbans. So easy are they to vanquish! Know 
<A NAME="653"></A>too that the dwellers in these parts have more good things than all the 
<A NAME="654"></A>rest of the world put together- gold, and silver, and brass, and embroidered 
<A NAME="655"></A>garments, beasts of burthen, and bond-servants- all which, if you only 
<A NAME="656"></A>wish it, you may soon have for your own. The nations border on one another, 
<A NAME="657"></A>in the order which I will now explain. Next to these Ionians" (here he 
<A NAME="658"></A>pointed with his finger to the map of the world which was engraved upon 
<A NAME="659"></A>the tablet that he had brought with him) "these Lydians dwell; their soil 
<A NAME="660"></A>is fertile, and few people are so rich in silver. Next to them," he continued, 
<A NAME="661"></A>"come these Phrygians, who have more flocks and herds than any race that 
<A NAME="662"></A>I know, and more plentiful harvests. On them border the Cappadocians, whom 
<A NAME="663"></A>we Greeks know by the name of Syrians: they are neighbours to the Cilicians, 
<A NAME="664"></A>who extend all the way to this sea, where Cyprus (the island which you 
<A NAME="665"></A>see here) lies. The Cilicians pay the king a yearly tribute of five hundred 
<A NAME="666"></A>talents. Next to them come the Armenians, who live here- they too have 
<A NAME="667"></A>numerous flocks and herds. After them come the Matieni, inhabiting this 
<A NAME="668"></A>country; then Cissia, this province, where you see the river Choaspes marked, 
<A NAME="669"></A>and likewise the town Susa upon its banks, where the Great King holds his 
<A NAME="670"></A>court, and where the treasuries are in which his wealth is stored. Once 
<A NAME="671"></A>masters of this city, you may be bold to vie with Jove himself for riches. 
<A NAME="672"></A>In the wars which ye wage with your rivals of Messenia, with them of Argos 
<A NAME="673"></A>likewise and of Arcadia, about paltry boundaries and strips of land not 
<A NAME="674"></A>so remarkably good, ye contend with those who have no gold, nor silver 
<A NAME="675"></A>even, which often give men heart to fight and die. Must ye wage such wars, 
<A NAME="676"></A>and when ye might so easily be lords of Asia, will ye decide otherwise?" 
<A NAME="677"></A>Thus spoke Aristagoras; and Cleomenes replied to him,- "Milesian stranger, 
<A NAME="678"></A>three days hence I will give thee an answer."
<A NAME="679"></A><BR><BR>So they proceeded no further at that time. When, however, the day 
<A NAME="680"></A>appointed for the answer came, and the two once more met, Cleomenes asked 
<A NAME="681"></A>Aristagoras, "how many days' journey it was from the sea of the Ionians 
<A NAME="682"></A>to the king's residence?" Hereupon Aristagoras, who had managed the rest 
<A NAME="683"></A>so cleverly, and succeeded in deceiving the king, tripped in his speech 
<A NAME="684"></A>and blundered; for instead of concealing the truth, as he ought to have 
<A NAME="685"></A>done if he wanted to induce the Spartans to cross into Asia, he said plainly 
<A NAME="686"></A>that it was a journey of three months. Cleomenes caught at the words, and, 
<A NAME="687"></A>preventing Aristagoras from finishing what he had begun to say concerning 
<A NAME="688"></A>the road, addressed him thus:- "Milesian stranger, quit Sparta before sunset. 
<A NAME="689"></A>This is no good proposal that thou makest to the Lacedaemonians, to conduct 
<A NAME="690"></A>them a distance of three months' journey from the sea." When he had thus 
<A NAME="691"></A>spoken, Cleomenes went to his home.
<A NAME="692"></A><BR><BR>But Aristagoras took an olive-bough in his hand, and hastened to 
<A NAME="693"></A>the king's house, where he was admitted by reason of his suppliant's pliant's 
<A NAME="694"></A>guise. Gorgo, the daughter of Cleomenes, and his only child, a girl of 
<A NAME="695"></A>about eight or nine years of age, happened to be there, standing by her 
<A NAME="696"></A>father's side. Aristagoras, seeing her, requested Cleomenes to send her 
<A NAME="697"></A>out of the room before he began to speak with him; but Cleomenes told him 
<A NAME="698"></A>to say on, and not mind the child. So Aristagoras began with a promise 
<A NAME="699"></A>of ten talents if the king would grant him his request, and when Cleomenes 
<A NAME="700"></A>shook his head, continued to raise his offer till it reached fifty talents; 
<A NAME="701"></A>whereupon the child spoke:- "Father," she said, "get up and go, or the 
<A NAME="702"></A>stranger will certainly corrupt thee." Then Cleomenes, pleased at the warning 
<A NAME="703"></A>of his child, withdrew and went into another room. Aristagoras quitted 
<A NAME="704"></A>Sparta for good, not being able to discourse any more concerning the road 
<A NAME="705"></A>which led up to the king.
<A NAME="706"></A><BR><BR>Now the true account of the road in question is the following:- 
<A NAME="707"></A>Royal stations exist along its whole length, and excellent caravanserais; 
<A NAME="708"></A>and throughout, it traverses an inhabited tract, and is free from danger. 
<A NAME="709"></A>In Lydia and Phrygia there are twenty stations within a distance Of 94 
<A NAME="710"></A>1/2 parasangs. On leaving Phrygia the Halys has to be crossed; and here 
<A NAME="711"></A>are gates through which you must needs pass ere you can traverse the stream. 
<A NAME="712"></A>A strong force guards this post. When you have made the passage, and are 
<A NAME="713"></A>come into Cappadocia, 28 stations and 104 parasangs bring you to the borders 
<A NAME="714"></A>of Cilicia, where the road passes through two sets of gates, at each of 
<A NAME="715"></A>which there is a guard posted. Leaving these behind, you go on through 
<A NAME="716"></A>Cilicia, where you find three stations in a distance of 15 1/2 parasangs. 
<A NAME="717"></A>The boundary between Cilicia and Armenia is the river Euphrates, which 
<A NAME="718"></A>it is necessary to cross in boats. In Armenia the resting-places are 15 
<A NAME="719"></A>in number, and the distance is 56 1/2 parasangs. There is one place where 
<A NAME="720"></A>a guard is posted. Four large streams intersect this district, all of which 
<A NAME="721"></A>have to be crossed by means of boats. The first of these is the Tigris; 
<A NAME="722"></A>the second and the third have both of them the same name, though they are 
<A NAME="723"></A>not only different rivers, but do not even run from the same place. For 
<A NAME="724"></A>the one which I have called the first of the two has its source in Armenia, 
<A NAME="725"></A>while the other flows afterwards out of the country of the Matienians. 
<A NAME="726"></A>The fourth of the streams is called the Gyndes, and this is the river which 
<A NAME="727"></A>Cyrus dispersed by digging for it three hundred and sixty channels. Leaving 
<A NAME="728"></A>Armenia and entering the Matienian country, you have four stations; these 
<A NAME="729"></A>passed you find yourself in Cissia, where eleven stations and 42 1/2 parasangs 
<A NAME="730"></A>bring you to another navigable stream, the Choaspes, on the banks of which 
<A NAME="731"></A>the city of Susa is built. Thus the entire number of the stations is raised 
<A NAME="732"></A>to one hundred and eleven; and so many are in fact the resting-places that 
<A NAME="733"></A>one finds between Sardis and Susa.
<A NAME="734"></A><BR><BR>If then the royal road be measured aright, and the parasang equals, 
<A NAME="735"></A>as it does, thirty furlongs, the whole distance from Sardis to the palace 
<A NAME="736"></A>of Memnon (as it is called), amounting thus to 450 parasangs, would be 
<A NAME="737"></A>13,500 furlongs. Travelling then at the rate of 150 furlongs a day, one 
<A NAME="738"></A>will take exactly ninety days to perform the journey.
<A NAME="739"></A><BR><BR>Thus when Aristagoras the Milesian told Cleomenes the Lacedaemonian 
<A NAME="740"></A>that it was a three months' journey from the sea up to the king, he said 
<A NAME="741"></A>no more than the truth. The exact distance (if any one desires still greater 
<A NAME="742"></A>accuracy) is somewhat more; for the journey from Ephesus to Sardis must 
<A NAME="743"></A>be added to the foregoing account; and this will make the whole distance 
<A NAME="744"></A>between the Greek Sea and Susa (or the city of Memnon, as it is called) 
<A NAME="745"></A>14,040 furlongs; since Ephesus is distant from Sardis 540 furlongs. This 
<A NAME="746"></A>would add three days to the three months' journey.
<A NAME="747"></A><BR><BR>When Aristagoras left Sparta he hastened to Athens, which had got 
<A NAME="748"></A>quit of its tyrants in the way that I will now describe. After the death 
<A NAME="749"></A>of Hipparchus (the son of Pisistratus, and brother of the tyrant Hippias), 
<A NAME="750"></A>who, in spite of the clear warning he had received concerning his fate 
<A NAME="751"></A>in a dream, was slain by Harmodius and Aristogeiton (men both of the race 
<A NAME="752"></A>of the Gephyraeans), the oppression of the Athenians continued by the space 
<A NAME="753"></A>of four years; and they gained nothing, but were worse used than 
<A NAME="754"></A>before.
<A NAME="755"></A><BR><BR>Now the dream of Hipparchus was the following:- The night before 
<A NAME="756"></A>the Panathenaic festival, he thought he saw in his sleep a tall and beautiful 
<A NAME="757"></A>man, who stood over him, and read him the following 
<A NAME="758"></A>riddle:-
<A NAME="759"></A><BR><BR>Bear thou unbearable woes with the all-bearing heart of a 
<A NAME="760"></A>lion;
<A NAME="761"></A><BR>Never, be sure, shall wrong-doer escape the reward of wrong-doing. 
<A NAME="762"></A>As soon as day dawned he sent and submitted his dream to the interpreters, 
<A NAME="763"></A>after which he offered the averting sacrifices, and then went and led the 
<A NAME="764"></A>procession in which he perished.
<A NAME="765"></A><BR><BR>The family of the Gephyraeans, to which the murderers of Hipparchus 
<A NAME="766"></A>belonged, according to their own account, came originally from Eretria. 
<A NAME="767"></A>My inquiries, however, have made it clear to me that they are in reality 
<A NAME="768"></A>Phoenicians, descendants of those who came with Cadmus into the country 
<A NAME="769"></A>now called Boeotia. Here they received for their portion the district of 
<A NAME="770"></A>Tanagra, in which they afterwards dwelt. On their expulsion from this country 
<A NAME="771"></A>by the Boeotians (which happened some time after that of the Cadmeians 
<A NAME="772"></A>from the same parts by the Argives) they took refuge at Athens. The Athenians 
<A NAME="773"></A>received them among their citizens upon set terms, whereby they were excluded 
<A NAME="774"></A>from a number of privileges which are not worth mentioning.
<A NAME="775"></A><BR><BR>Now the Phoenicians who came with Cadmus, and to whom the Gephyraei 
<A NAME="776"></A>belonged, introduced into Greece upon their arrival a great variety of 
<A NAME="777"></A>arts, among the rest that of writing, whereof the Greeks till then had, 
<A NAME="778"></A>as I think, been ignorant. And originally they shaped their letters exactly 
<A NAME="779"></A>like all the other Phoenicians, but afterwards, in course of time, they 
<A NAME="780"></A>changed by degrees their language, and together with it the form likewise 
<A NAME="781"></A>of their characters. Now the Greeks who dwelt about those parts at that 
<A NAME="782"></A>time were chiefly the Ionians. The Phoenician letters were accordingly 
<A NAME="783"></A>adopted by them, but with some variation in the shape of a few, and so 
<A NAME="784"></A>they arrived at the present use, still calling the letters Phoenician, 
<A NAME="785"></A>as justice required, after the name of those who were the first to introduce 
<A NAME="786"></A>them into Greece. Paper rolls also were called from of old "parchments" 
<A NAME="787"></A>by the Ionians, because formerly when paper was scarce they used, instead, 
<A NAME="788"></A>the skins of sheep and goats- on which material many of the barbarians 
<A NAME="789"></A>are even now wont to write.
<A NAME="790"></A><BR><BR>I myself saw Cadmeian characters engraved upon some tripods in 
<A NAME="791"></A>the temple of Apollo Ismenias in Boeotian Thebes, most of them shaped like 
<A NAME="792"></A>the Ionian. One of the tripods has the inscription following:-
<A NAME="793"></A><BR><BR>Me did Amphitryon place, from the far Teleboans 
<A NAME="794"></A>coming.
<A NAME="795"></A><BR><BR>This would be about the age of Laius, the son of Labdacus, the 
<A NAME="796"></A>son of Polydorus, the son of Cadmus.
<A NAME="797"></A><BR><BR>Another of the tripods has this legend in the hexameter 
<A NAME="798"></A>measure:-
<A NAME="799"></A><BR><BR>I to far-shooting Phoebus was offered by Scaeus the 
<A NAME="800"></A>boxer,
<A NAME="801"></A><BR>When he had won at the games- a wondrous beautiful offering. This might 
<A NAME="802"></A>be Scaeus, the son of Hippocoon; and the tripod, if dedicated by him, and 
<A NAME="803"></A>not by another of the same name, would belong to the time of Oedipus, the 
<A NAME="804"></A>son of Laius.
<A NAME="805"></A><BR><BR>The third tripod has also an inscription in hexameters, which runs 
<A NAME="806"></A>thus:-
<A NAME="807"></A><BR><BR>King Laodamas gave this tripod to far-seeing 
<A NAME="808"></A>Phoebus,
<A NAME="809"></A><BR>When he was set on the throne- a wondrous beautiful offering. It was 
<A NAME="810"></A>in the reign of this Laodamas, the son of Eteocles, that the Cadmeians 
<A NAME="811"></A>were driven by the Argives out of their country, and found a shelter with 
<A NAME="812"></A>the Encheleans. The Gephyraeans at that time remained in the country, but 
<A NAME="813"></A>afterwards they retired before the Boeotians, and took refuge at Athens, 
<A NAME="814"></A>where they have a number of temples for their separate use, which the other 
<A NAME="815"></A>Athenians are not allowed to enter- among the rest, one of Achaean Ceres, 
<A NAME="816"></A>in whose honour they likewise celebrate special orgies.
<A NAME="817"></A><BR><BR>Having thus related the dream which Hipparchus saw, and traced 
<A NAME="818"></A>the descent of the Gephyraeans, the family whereto his murderers belonged, 
<A NAME="819"></A>I must proceed with the matter whereof I was intending before to speak; 
<A NAME="820"></A>to wit, the way in which the Athenians got quit of their tyrants. Upon 
<A NAME="821"></A>the death of Hipparchus, Hippias, who was king, grew harsh towards the 
<A NAME="822"></A>Athenians; and the Alcaeonidae, an Athenian family which had been banished 
<A NAME="823"></A>by the Pisistratidae, joined the other exiles, and endeavoured to procure 
<A NAME="824"></A>their own return, and to free Athens, by force. They seized and fortified 
<A NAME="825"></A>Leipsydrium above Paeonia, and tried to gain their object by arms; but 
<A NAME="826"></A>great disasters befell them, and their purpose remained unaccomplished. 
<A NAME="827"></A>They therefore resolved to shrink from no contrivance that might bring 
<A NAME="828"></A>them success; and accordingly they contracted with the Amphictyons to build 
<A NAME="829"></A>the temple which now stands at Delphi, but which in those days did not 
<A NAME="830"></A>exist. Having done this, they proceeded, being men of great wealth and 
<A NAME="831"></A>members of an ancient and distinguished family, to build the temple much 
<A NAME="832"></A>more magnificently than the plan obliged them. Besides other improvements, 
<A NAME="833"></A>instead of the coarse stone whereof by the contract the temple was to have 
<A NAME="834"></A>been constructed, they made the facings of Parian marble.
<A NAME="835"></A><BR><BR>These same men, if we may believe the Athenians, during their stay 
<A NAME="836"></A>at Delphi persuaded the Pythoness by a bribe to tell the Spartans, whenever 
<A NAME="837"></A>any of them came to consult the oracle, either on their own private affairs 
<A NAME="838"></A>or on the business of the state, that they must free Athens. So the Lacedaemonians, 
<A NAME="839"></A>when they found no answer ever returned to them but this, sent at last 
<A NAME="840"></A>Anchimolius, the son of Aster- a man of note among their citizens- at the 
<A NAME="841"></A>head of an army against Athens, with orders to drive out the Pisistratidae, 
<A NAME="842"></A>albeit they were bound to them by the closest ties of friendship. For they 
<A NAME="843"></A>esteemed the things of heaven more highly than the things of men. The troops 
<A NAME="844"></A>went by sea and were conveyed in transports. Anchimolius brought them to 
<A NAME="845"></A>an anchorage at Phalerum; and there the men disembarked. But the Pisistratidae, 
<A NAME="846"></A>who had previous knowledge of their intentions, had sent to Thessaly, between 
<A NAME="847"></A>which country and Athens there was an alliance, with a request for aid. 
<A NAME="848"></A>The Thessalians, in reply to their entreaties, sent them by a public vote 
<A NAME="849"></A>1000 horsemen, under the command of their king, Cineas, who was a Coniaean. 
<A NAME="850"></A>When this help came, the Pisistratidae laid their plan accordingly: they 
<A NAME="851"></A>cleared the whole plain about Phalerum so as to make it fit for the movements 
<A NAME="852"></A>of cavalry, and then charged the enemy's camp with their horse, which fell 
<A NAME="853"></A>with such fury upon the Lacedaemonians as to kill numbers, among the rest 
<A NAME="854"></A>Anchimolius, the general, and to drive the remainder to their ships. Such 
<A NAME="855"></A>was the fate of the first army sent from Lacedaemon, and the tomb of Anchimolius 
<A NAME="856"></A>may be seen to this day in Attica; it is at Alopecae (Foxtown), near the 
<A NAME="857"></A>temple of Hercules in Cynosargos.
<A NAME="858"></A><BR><BR>Afterwards, the Lacedaemonians despatched a larger force against 
<A NAME="859"></A>Athens, which they put under the command of Cleomenes, son of Anaxandridas, 
<A NAME="860"></A>one of their kings. These troops were not sent by sea, but marched by the 
<A NAME="861"></A>mainland. When they were come into Attica, their first encounter was with 
<A NAME="862"></A>the Thessalian horse, which they shortly put to flight, killing above forty 
<A NAME="863"></A>men; the remainder made good their escape, and fled straight to Thessaly. 
<A NAME="864"></A>Cleomenes proceeded to the city, and, with the aid of such of the Athenians 
<A NAME="865"></A>as wished for freedom, besieged the tyrants, who had shut themselves up 
<A NAME="866"></A>in the Pelasgic fortress.
<A NAME="867"></A><BR><BR>And now there had been small chance of the Pisistratidae falling 
<A NAME="868"></A>into the hands of the Spartans, who did not even design to sit down before 
<A NAME="869"></A>the place, which had moreover been well provisioned beforehand with stores 
<A NAME="870"></A>both of meat and drink,- nay, it is likely that after a few days' blockade 
<A NAME="871"></A>the Lacedaemonians would have quitted Attica altogether, and gone back 
<A NAME="872"></A>to Sparta- had not an event occurred most unlucky for the besieged, and 
<A NAME="873"></A>most advantageous for the besiegers. The children of the Pisistratidae 
<A NAME="874"></A>were made prisoners, as they were being removed out of the country. By 
<A NAME="875"></A>this calamity all their plans were deranged, and-as the ransom of their 
<A NAME="876"></A>children- they consented to the demands of the Athenians, and agreed within 
<A NAME="877"></A>five days' time to quit Attica. Accordingly they soon afterwards left the 
<A NAME="878"></A>country, and withdrew to Sigeum on the Scamander, after reigning thirty-six 
<A NAME="879"></A>years over the Athenians. By descent they were Pylians, of the family of 
<A NAME="880"></A>the Neleids, to which Codrus and Melanthus likewise belonged, men who in 
<A NAME="881"></A>former times from foreign settlers became kings of Athens. And hence it 
<A NAME="882"></A>was that Hippocrates came to think of calling his son Pisistratus: he named 
<A NAME="883"></A>him after the Pisistratus who was a son of Nestor. Such then was the mode 
<A NAME="884"></A>in which the Athenians got quit of their tyrants. What they did and suffered 
<A NAME="885"></A>worthy of note from the time when they gained their freedom until the revolt 
<A NAME="886"></A>of Ionia from King Darius, and the coming of Aristagoras to Athens with 
<A NAME="887"></A>a request that the Athenians would lend the Ionians aid, I shall now proceed 
<A NAME="888"></A>to relate.
<A NAME="889"></A><BR><BR>The power of Athens had been great before; but, now that the tyrants 
<A NAME="890"></A>were gone, it became greater than ever. The chief authority was lodged 
<A NAME="891"></A>with two persons, Clisthenes, of the family of the Alcmaeonids, who is 
<A NAME="892"></A>said to have been the persuader of the Pythoness, and Isagoras, the son 
<A NAME="893"></A>of Tisander, who belonged to a noble house, but whose pedigree I am not 
<A NAME="894"></A>able to trace further. Howbeit his kinsmen offer sacrifice to the Carian 
<A NAME="895"></A>Jupiter. These two men strove together for the mastery; and Clisthenes, 
<A NAME="896"></A>finding himself the weaker, called to his aid the common people. Hereupon, 
<A NAME="897"></A>instead of the four tribes among which the Athenians had been divided hitherto, 
<A NAME="898"></A>Clisthenes made ten tribes, and parcelled out the Athenians among them. 
<A NAME="899"></A>He likewise changed the names of the tribes; for whereas they had till 
<A NAME="900"></A>now been called after Geleon, Aegicores, Argades, and Hoples, the four 
<A NAME="901"></A>sons of Ion, Clisthenes set these names aside, and called his tribes after 
<A NAME="902"></A>certain other heroes, all of whom were native, except Ajax. Ajax was associated 
<A NAME="903"></A>because, although a foreigner, he was a neighbour and an ally of 
<A NAME="904"></A>Athens.
<A NAME="905"></A><BR><BR>My belief is that in acting thus he did but imitate his maternal 
<A NAME="906"></A>grandfather, Clisthenes, king of Sicyon. This king, when he was at war 
<A NAME="907"></A>with Argos, put an end to the contests of the rhapsodists at Sicyon, because 
<A NAME="908"></A>in the Homeric poems Argos and the Argives were so constantly the theme 
<A NAME="909"></A>of song. He likewise conceived the wish to drive Adrastus, the son of Talaus, 
<A NAME="910"></A>out of his country, seeing that he was an Argive hero. For Adrastus had 
<A NAME="911"></A>a shrine at Sicyon, which yet stands in the market-place of the town. Clisthenes 
<A NAME="912"></A>therefore went to Delphi, and asked the oracle if he might expel Adrastus. 
<A NAME="913"></A>To this the Pythoness is reported to have answered- "Adrastus is the Sicyonians' 
<A NAME="914"></A>king, but thou art only a robber." So when the god would not grant his 
<A NAME="915"></A>request, he went home and began to think how he might contrive to make 
<A NAME="916"></A>Adrastus withdraw of his own accord. After a while he hit upon a plan which 
<A NAME="917"></A>he thought would succeed. He sent envoys to Thebes in Boeotia, and informed 
<A NAME="918"></A>the Thebans that he wished to bring Melanippus, the son of Astacus, to 
<A NAME="919"></A>Sicyon. The Thebans consenting, Clisthenes carried Melanippus back with 
<A NAME="920"></A>him, assigned him a precinct within the government-house, and built him 
<A NAME="921"></A>a shrine there in the safest and strongest part. The reason for his so 
<A NAME="922"></A>doing (which I must not forbear to mention) was because Melanippus was 
<A NAME="923"></A>Adrastus' great enemy, having slain both his brother Mecistes and his son-in-law 
<A NAME="924"></A>Tydeus. Clisthenes, after assigning the precinct to Melanippus, took away 
<A NAME="925"></A>from Adrastus the sacrifices and festivals wherewith he had till then been 
<A NAME="926"></A>honoured, and transferred them to his adversary. Hitherto the Sicyonians 
<A NAME="927"></A>had paid extraordinary honours to Adrastus, because the country had belonged 
<A NAME="928"></A>to Polybus, and Adrastus was Polybus' daughter's son; whence it came to 
<A NAME="929"></A>pass that Polybus, dying childless, left Adrastus his kingdom. Besides 
<A NAME="930"></A>other ceremonies, it had been their wont to honour Adrastus with tragic 
<A NAME="931"></A>choruses, which they assigned to him rather than Bacchus, on account of 
<A NAME="932"></A>his calamities. Clisthenes now gave the choruses to Bacchus, transferring 
<A NAME="933"></A>to Melanippus the rest of the sacred rites.
<A NAME="934"></A><BR><BR>Such were his doings in the matter of Adrastus. With respect to 
<A NAME="935"></A>the Dorian tribes, not choosing the Sicyonians to have the same tribes 
<A NAME="936"></A>as the Argives, he changed all the old names for new ones; and here he 
<A NAME="937"></A>took special occasion to mock the Sicyonians, for he drew his new names 
<A NAME="938"></A>from the words "pig," and "ass," adding thereto the usual tribe-endings; 
<A NAME="939"></A>only in the case of his own tribe he did nothing of the sort, but gave 
<A NAME="940"></A>them a name drawn from his own kingly office. For he called his own tribe 
<A NAME="941"></A>the Archelai, or Rulers, while the others he named Hyatae, or Pig-folk, 
<A NAME="942"></A>Oneatae, or Assfolk, and Choereatae, or Swine-folk. The Sicyonians kept 
<A NAME="943"></A>these names, not only during the reign of Clisthenes, but even after his 
<A NAME="944"></A>death, by the space of sixty years: then, however, they took counsel together, 
<A NAME="945"></A>and changed to the well-known names of Hyllaeans, Pamphylians, and Dymanatae, 
<A NAME="946"></A>taking at the same time, as a fourth name, the title of Aegialeans, from 
<A NAME="947"></A>Aegialeus the son of Adrastus.
<A NAME="948"></A><BR><BR>Thus had Clisthenes the Sicyonian done. The Athenian Clisthenes, 
<A NAME="949"></A>who was grandson by the mother's side of the other, and had been named 
<A NAME="950"></A>after him, resolved, from contempt (as I believe) of the Ionians, that 
<A NAME="951"></A>his tribes should not be the same as theirs; and so followed the pattern 
<A NAME="952"></A>set him by his namesake of Sicyon. Having brought entirely over to his 
<A NAME="953"></A>own side the common people of Athens, whom he had before disdained, he 
<A NAME="954"></A>gave all the tribes new names, and made the number greater than formerly; 
<A NAME="955"></A>instead of the four phylarchs he established ten; he likewise placed ten 
<A NAME="956"></A>demes in each of the tribes; and he was, now that the common people took 
<A NAME="957"></A>his part, very much more powerful than his adversaries.
<A NAME="958"></A><BR><BR>Isagoras in his turn lost ground; and therefore, to counter-plot 
<A NAME="959"></A>his enemy, he called in Cleomenes the Lacedaemonian, who had already, at 
<A NAME="960"></A>the time when he was besieging the Pisistratidae, made a contract of friendship 
<A NAME="961"></A>with him. A charge is even brought against Cleomenes that he was on terms 
<A NAME="962"></A>of too great familiarity with Isagoras's wife. At this time the first thing 
<A NAME="963"></A>that he did was to send a herald and require that Clisthenes, and a large 
<A NAME="964"></A>number of Athenians besides, whom he called "The Accursed," should leave 
<A NAME="965"></A>Athens. This message he sent at the suggestion of Isagoras: for in the 
<A NAME="966"></A>affair referred to, the blood-guiltiness lay on the Alcmaeonidae and their 
<A NAME="967"></A>partisans, while he and his friends were quite clear of 
<A NAME="968"></A>it.
<A NAME="969"></A><BR><BR>The way in which "The Accursed" at Athens got their name, was the 
<A NAME="970"></A>following. There was a certain Athenian called Cylon, a victor at the Olympic 
<A NAME="971"></A>Games, who aspired to the sovereignty, and aided by a number of his companions, 
<A NAME="972"></A>who were of the same age with himself, made an attempt to seize the citadel. 
<A NAME="973"></A>But the attack failed; and Cylon became a suppliant at the image. Hereupon 
<A NAME="974"></A>the Heads of the Naucraries, who at that time bore rule in Athens, induced 
<A NAME="975"></A>the fugitives to remove by a promise to spare their lives. Nevertheless 
<A NAME="976"></A>they were all slain; and the blame was laid on the Alcmaeonidae. All this 
<A NAME="977"></A>happened before the time of Pisistratus.
<A NAME="978"></A><BR><BR>When the message of Cleomenes arrived, requiring Clisthenes and 
<A NAME="979"></A>"The Accursed" to quit the city, Clisthenes departed of his own accord. 
<A NAME="980"></A>Cleomenes, however, notwithstanding his departure, came to Athens, with 
<A NAME="981"></A>a small band of followers; and on his arrival sent into banishment seven 
<A NAME="982"></A>hundred Athenian families, which were pointed out to him by Isagoras. Succeeding 
<A NAME="983"></A>here, he next endeavoured to dissolve the council, and to put the government 
<A NAME="984"></A>into the hands of three hundred of the partisans of that leader. But the 
<A NAME="985"></A>council resisted, and refused to obey his orders; whereupon Cleomenes, 
<A NAME="986"></A>Isagoras, and their followers took possession of the citadel. Here they 
<A NAME="987"></A>were attacked by the rest of the Athenians, who took the side of the council, 
<A NAME="988"></A>and were besieged for the space of two days: on the third day they accepted 
<A NAME="989"></A>terms, being allowed- at least such of them as were Lacedaemonians- to 
<A NAME="990"></A>quit the country. And so the word which came to Cleomenes received its 
<A NAME="991"></A>fulfilment. For when he first went up into the citadel, meaning to seize 
<A NAME="992"></A>it, just as he was entering the sanctuary of the goddess, in order to question 
<A NAME="993"></A>her, the priestess arose from her throne, before he had passed the doors, 
<A NAME="994"></A>and said- "Stranger from Lacedaemon, depart hence, and presume not to enter 
<A NAME="995"></A>the holy place- it is not lawful for a Dorian to set foot there." But he 
<A NAME="996"></A>answered, "Oh! woman, I am not a Dorian, but an Achaean." Slighting this 
<A NAME="997"></A>warning, Cleomenes made his attempt, and so he was forced to retire, together 
<A NAME="998"></A>with his Lacedaemonians. The rest were cast into prison by the Athenians, 
<A NAME="999"></A>and condemned to die- among them Timasitheus the Delphian, of whose prowess 
<A NAME="1000"></A>and courage I have great things which I could tell.
<A NAME="1001"></A><BR><BR>So these men died in prison. The Athenians directly afterwards 
<A NAME="1002"></A>recalled Clisthenes, and the seven hundred families which Cleomenes had 
<A NAME="1003"></A>driven out; and, further, they sent envoys to Sardis, to make an alliance 
<A NAME="1004"></A>with the Persians, for they knew that war would follow with Cleomenes and 
<A NAME="1005"></A>the Lacedaemonians. When the ambassadors reached Sardis and delivered their 
<A NAME="1006"></A>message, Artaphernes, son of Hystaspes, who was at that time governor of 
<A NAME="1007"></A>the Place, inquired of them "who they were, and in what part of the world 
<A NAME="1008"></A>they dwelt, that they wanted to become allies of the Persians?" The messengers 
<A NAME="1009"></A>told him; upon which he answered them shortly- that "if the Athenians chose 
<A NAME="1010"></A>to give earth and water to King Darius, he would conclude an alliance with 
<A NAME="1011"></A>them; but if not, they might go home again." After consulting together, 
<A NAME="1012"></A>the envoys, anxious to form the alliance, accepted the terms; but on their 
<A NAME="1013"></A>return to Athens, they fell into deep disgrace on account of their 
<A NAME="1014"></A>compliance.
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile Cleomenes, who considered himself to have been insulted 
<A NAME="1016"></A>by the Athenians both in word and deed, was drawing a force together from 
<A NAME="1017"></A>all parts of the Peloponnese, without informing any one of his object; 
<A NAME="1018"></A>which was to revenge himself on the Athenians, and to establish Isagoras, 
<A NAME="1019"></A>who had escaped with him from the citadel, as despot of Athens. Accordingly, 
<A NAME="1020"></A>with a large army, he invaded the district of Eleusis, while the Boeotians, 
<A NAME="1021"></A>who had concerted measures with him, took Oenoe and Hysiae, two country 
<A NAME="1022"></A>towns upon the frontier; and at the same time the Chalcideans, on another 
<A NAME="1023"></A>side, plundered divers places in Attica. The Athenians, notwithstanding 
<A NAME="1024"></A>that danger threatened them from every quarter, put off all thought of 
<A NAME="1025"></A>the Boeotians and Chalcideans till a future time, and marched against the 
<A NAME="1026"></A>Peloponnesians, who were at Eleusis.
<A NAME="1027"></A><BR><BR>As the two hosts were about to engage, first of all the Corinthians, 
<A NAME="1028"></A>bethinking themselves that they were perpetrating a wrong, changed their 
<A NAME="1029"></A>minds, and drew off from the main army. Then Demaratus, son of Ariston, 
<A NAME="1030"></A>who was himself king of Sparta and joint-leader of the expedition, and 
<A NAME="1031"></A>who till now had had no sort of quarrel with Cleomenes, followed their 
<A NAME="1032"></A>example. On account of this rupture between the kings, a law was passed 
<A NAME="1033"></A>at Sparta, forbidding both monarchs to go out together with the army, as 
<A NAME="1034"></A>had been the custom hitherto. The law also provided, that, as one of the 
<A NAME="1035"></A>kings was to be left behind, one of the Tyndaridae should also remain at 
<A NAME="1036"></A>home; whereas hitherto both had accompanied the expeditions, as auxiliaries. 
<A NAME="1037"></A>So when the rest of the allies saw that the Lacedaemonian kings were not 
<A NAME="1038"></A>of one mind, and that the Corinthian troops had quitted their post, they 
<A NAME="1039"></A>likewise drew off and departed.
<A NAME="1040"></A><BR><BR>This was the fourth time that the Dorians had invaded Attica: twice 
<A NAME="1041"></A>they came as enemies, and twice they came to do good service to the Athenian 
<A NAME="1042"></A>people. Their first invasion took place at the period when they founded 
<A NAME="1043"></A>Megara, and is rightly placed in the reign of Codrus at Athens; the second 
<A NAME="1044"></A>and third occasions were when they came from Sparta to drive out the Pisistratidae; 
<A NAME="1045"></A>the fourth was the present attack, when Cleomenes, at the head of a Peloponnesian 
<A NAME="1046"></A>army, entered at Eleusis. Thus the Dorians had now four times invaded 
<A NAME="1047"></A>Attica.
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR><BR>So when the Spartan army had broken up from its quarters thus ingloriously, 
<A NAME="1049"></A>the Athenians, wishing to revenge themselves, marched first against the 
<A NAME="1050"></A>Chalcideans. The Boeotians, however, advancing to the aid of the latter 
<A NAME="1051"></A>as far as the Euripus, the Athenians thought it best to attack them first. 
<A NAME="1052"></A>A battle was fought accordingly; and the Athenians gained a very complete 
<A NAME="1053"></A>victory, killing a vast number of the enemy, and taking seven hundred of 
<A NAME="1054"></A>them alive. After this, on the very same day, they crossed into Euboea, 
<A NAME="1055"></A>and engaged the Chalcideans with the like success; whereupon they left 
<A NAME="1056"></A>four thousand settlers upon the lands of the Hippobotae,- which is the 
<A NAME="1057"></A>name the Chalcideans give to their rich men. All the Chalcidean prisoners 
<A NAME="1058"></A>whom they took were put in irons, and kept for a long time in close confinement, 
<A NAME="1059"></A>as likewise were the Boeotians, until the ransom asked for them was paid; 
<A NAME="1060"></A>and this the Athenians fixed at two minae the man. The chains wherewith 
<A NAME="1061"></A>they were fettered the Athenians suspended in their citadel; where they 
<A NAME="1062"></A>were still to be seen in my day, hanging against the wall scorched by the 
<A NAME="1063"></A>Median flames, opposite the chapel which faces the west. The Athenians 
<A NAME="1064"></A>made an offering of the tenth part of the ransom-money: and expended it 
<A NAME="1065"></A>on the brazen chariot drawn by four steeds, which stands on the left hand 
<A NAME="1066"></A>immediately that one enters the gateway of the citadel. The inscription 
<A NAME="1067"></A>runs as follows:-
<A NAME="1068"></A><BR><BR>When Chalcis and Boeotia dared her might,
<A NAME="1069"></A><BR>Athens subdued their pride in valorous fight;
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR>Gave bonds for insults; and, the ransom paid,
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR>From the full tenths these steeds for Pallas made.
<A NAME="1072"></A><BR><BR>Thus did the Athenians increase in strength. And it is plain enough, 
<A NAME="1073"></A>not from this instance only, but from many everywhere, that freedom is 
<A NAME="1074"></A>an excellent thing since even the Athenians, who, while they continued 
<A NAME="1075"></A>under the rule of tyrants, were not a whit more valiant than any of their 
<A NAME="1076"></A>neighbours, no sooner shook off the yoke than they became decidedly the 
<A NAME="1077"></A>first of all. These things show that, while undergoing oppression, they 
<A NAME="1078"></A>let themselves be beaten, since then they worked for a master; but so soon 
<A NAME="1079"></A>as they got their freedom, each man was eager to do the best he could for 
<A NAME="1080"></A>himself. So fared it now with the Athenians.

<A NAME="1087"></A>the advice to "ask the aid of those nearest them" than they exclaimed- 
<A NAME="1088"></A>"What! are not they who dwell the nearest to us the men of Tanagra, of 
<A NAME="1089"></A>Coronaea, and Thespiae? Yet these men always fight on our side, and have 
<A NAME="1090"></A>aided us with a good heart all through the war. Of what use is it to ask 
<A NAME="1091"></A>them? But maybe this is not the true meaning of the
