<A NAME="10"></A><B>Polymnia</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>Now when tidings of the battle that had been fought at Marathon 
<A NAME="12"></A>reached the ears of King Darius, the son of Hystaspes, his anger against 
<A NAME="13"></A>the Athenians, which had been already roused by their attack upon Sardis, 
<A NAME="14"></A>waxed still fiercer, and he became more than ever eager to lead an army 
<A NAME="15"></A>against Greece. Instantly he sent off messengers to make proclamation through 
<A NAME="16"></A>the several states that fresh levies were to be raised, and these at an 
<A NAME="17"></A>increased rate; while ships, horses, provisions, and transports were likewise 
<A NAME="18"></A>to be furnished. So the men published his commands; and now all Asia was 
<A NAME="19"></A>in commotion by the space of three years, while everywhere, as Greece was 
<A NAME="20"></A>to be attacked, the best and bravest were enrolled for the service, and 
<A NAME="21"></A>had to make their preparations accordingly.
<A NAME="22"></A><BR><BR>After this, in the fourth year, the Egyptians whom Cambyses had 
<A NAME="23"></A>enslaved revolted from the Persians; whereupon Darius was more hot for 
<A NAME="24"></A>war than ever, and earnestly desired to march an army against both 
<A NAME="25"></A>adversaries.
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR>Now, as he was about to lead forth his levies against Egypt and 
<A NAME="27"></A>Athens, a fierce contention for the sovereign power arose among his sons; 
<A NAME="28"></A>since the law of the Persians was that a king must not go out with his 
<A NAME="29"></A>army, until he has appointed one to succeed him upon the throne. Darius, 
<A NAME="30"></A>before he obtained the kingdom, had had three sons born to him from his 
<A NAME="31"></A>former wife, who was a daughter of Gobryas; while, since he began to reign, 
<A NAME="32"></A>Atossa, the daughter of Cyrus, had borne him four. Artabazanes was the 
<A NAME="33"></A>eldest of the first family, and Xerxes of the second. These two, therefore, 
<A NAME="34"></A>being the sons of different mothers, were now at variance. Artabazanes 
<A NAME="35"></A>claimed the crown as the eldest of all the children, because it was an 
<A NAME="36"></A>established custom all over the world for the eldest to have the pre-eminence; 
<A NAME="37"></A>while Xerxes, on the other hand, urged that he was sprung from Atossa, 
<A NAME="38"></A>the daughter of Cyrus, and that it was Cyrus who had won the Persians their 
<A NAME="39"></A>freedom.
<A NAME="40"></A><BR><BR>Before Darius had pronounced on the matter, it happened that Demaratus, 
<A NAME="41"></A>the son of Ariston, who had been deprived of his crown at Sparta, and had 
<A NAME="42"></A>afterwards, of his own accord, gone into banishment, came up to Susa, and 
<A NAME="43"></A>there heard of the quarrel of the princes. Hereupon, as report says, he 
<A NAME="44"></A>went to Xerxes, and advised him, in addition to all that he had urged before, 
<A NAME="45"></A>to plead- that at the time when he was born Darius was already king, and 
<A NAME="46"></A>bore rule over the Persians; but when Artabazanes came into the world, 
<A NAME="47"></A>he was a mere private person. It would therefore be neither right nor seemly 
<A NAME="48"></A>that the crown should go to another in preference to himself. "For at Sparta," 
<A NAME="49"></A>said Demaratus, byway of suggestion, "the law is that if a king has sons 
<A NAME="50"></A>before he comes to the throne, and another son is born to him afterwards, 
<A NAME="51"></A>the child so born is heir to his father's kingdom." Xerxes followed this 
<A NAME="52"></A>counsel, and Darius, persuaded that he had justice on his side, appointed 
<A NAME="53"></A>him his successor. For my own part I believe that, even without this, the 
<A NAME="54"></A>crown would have gone to Xerxes; for Atossa was all-powerful.
<A NAME="55"></A><BR><BR>Darius, when he had thus appointed Xerxes his heir, was minded 
<A NAME="56"></A>to lead forth his armies; but he was prevented by death while his preparations 
<A NAME="57"></A>were still proceeding. He died in the year following the revolt of Egypt 
<A NAME="58"></A>and the matters here related, after having reigned in all six-and-thirty 
<A NAME="59"></A>years, leaving the revolted Egyptians and the Athenians alike unpunished. 
<A NAME="60"></A>At his death the kingdom passed to his son Xerxes.
<A NAME="61"></A><BR><BR>Now Xerxes, on first mounting the throne, was coldly disposed towards 
<A NAME="62"></A>the Grecian war, and made it his business to collect an army against Egypt. 
<A NAME="63"></A>But Mardonius, the son of Gobryas, who was at the court, and had more influence 
<A NAME="64"></A>with him than any of the other Persians, being his own cousin, the child 
<A NAME="65"></A>of a sister of Darius, plied him with discourses like the 
<A NAME="66"></A>following:-
<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR>"Master, it is not fitting that they of Athens escape scot-free, 
<A NAME="68"></A>after doing the Persians such great injury. Complete the work which thou 
<A NAME="69"></A>hast now in hand, and then, when the pride of Egypt is brought low, lead 
<A NAME="70"></A>an army against Athens. So shalt thou thyself have good report among men, 
<A NAME="71"></A>and others shall fear hereafter to attack thy country."
<A NAME="72"></A><BR><BR>Thus far it was of vengeance that he spoke; but sometimes he would 
<A NAME="73"></A>vary the theme, and observe by the way, "that Europe was a wondrous beautiful 
<A NAME="74"></A>region, rich in all kinds of cultivated trees, and the soil excellent: 
<A NAME="75"></A>no one, save the king, was worthy to own such a land."
<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR>All this he said, because he longed for adventures, and hoped to 
<A NAME="77"></A>become satrap of Greece under the king; and after a while he had his way, 
<A NAME="78"></A>and persuaded Xerxes to do according to his desires. Other things, however, 
<A NAME="79"></A>occurring about the same time, helped his persuasions. For, in the first 
<A NAME="80"></A>place, it chanced that messengers arrived from Thessaly, sent by the Aleuadae, 
<A NAME="81"></A>Thessalian kings, to invite Xerxes into Greece, and to promise him all 
<A NAME="82"></A>the assistance which it was in their power to give. And further, the Pisistratidae, 
<A NAME="83"></A>who had come up to Susa, held the same language as the Aleuadae, and worked 
<A NAME="84"></A>upon him even more than they, by means of Onomacritus of Athens, an oracle-monger, 
<A NAME="85"></A>and the same who set forth the prophecies of Musaeus in their order. The 
<A NAME="86"></A>Pisistratidae had previously been at enmity with this man, but made up 
<A NAME="87"></A>the quarrel before they removed to Susa. He was banished from Athens by 
<A NAME="88"></A>Hipparchus, the son of Pisistratus, because he foisted into the writings 
<A NAME="89"></A>of Musaeus a prophecy that the islands which lie off Lemnos would one day 
<A NAME="90"></A>disappear in the sea. Lasus of Hermione caught him in the act of so doing. 
<A NAME="91"></A>For this cause Hipparchus banished him, though till then they had been 
<A NAME="92"></A>the closest of friends. Now, however, he went up to Susa with the sons 
<A NAME="93"></A>of Pisistratus, and they talked very grandly of him to the king; while 
<A NAME="94"></A>he, for his part, whenever he was in the king's company, repeated to him 
<A NAME="95"></A>certain of the oracles; and while he took care to pass over all that spoke 
<A NAME="96"></A>of disaster to the barbarians, brought forward the passages which promised 
<A NAME="97"></A>them the greatest success. "'Twas fated," he told Xerxes, "that a Persian 
<A NAME="98"></A>should bridge the Hellespont, and march an army from Asia into Greece." 
<A NAME="99"></A>While Onomacritus thus plied Xerxes with his oracles, the Pisistratidae 
<A NAME="100"></A>and Aleuadae did not cease to press on him their advice, till at last the 
<A NAME="101"></A>king yielded, and agreed to lead forth an expedition.
<A NAME="102"></A><BR><BR>First, however, in the year following the death of Darius, he marched 
<A NAME="103"></A>against those who had revolted from him; and having reduced them, and laid 
<A NAME="104"></A>all Egypt under a far harder yoke than ever his father had put upon it, 
<A NAME="105"></A>he gave the government to Achaeamenes, who was his own brother, and son 
<A NAME="106"></A>to Darius. This Achaeamenes was afterwards slain in his government by Inaros, 
<A NAME="107"></A>the son of Psammetichus, a Libyan.
<A NAME="108"></A><BR><BR>(SS 1.) After Egypt was subdued, Xerxes, being about to take in 
<A NAME="109"></A>hand the expedition against Athens, called together an assembly of the 
<A NAME="110"></A>noblest Persians to learn their opinions, and to lay before them his own 
<A NAME="111"></A>designs. So, when the men were met, the king spake thus to 
<A NAME="112"></A>them:-
<A NAME="113"></A><BR><BR>"Persians, I shall not be the first to bring in among you a new 
<A NAME="114"></A>custom- I shall but follow one which has come down to us from our forefathers. 
<A NAME="115"></A>Never yet, as our old men assure me, has our race reposed itself, since 
<A NAME="116"></A>the time when Cyrus overcame Astyages, and so we Persians wrested the sceptre 
<A NAME="117"></A>from the Medes. Now in all this God guides us; and we, obeying his guidance, 
<A NAME="118"></A>prosper greatly. What need have I to tell you of the deeds of Cyrus and 
<A NAME="119"></A>Cambyses, and my own father Darius, how many nations they conquered, and 
<A NAME="120"></A>added to our dominions? Ye know right well what great things they achieved. 
<A NAME="121"></A>But for myself, I will say that, from the day on which I mounted the throne, 
<A NAME="122"></A>I have not ceased to consider by what means I may rival those who have 
<A NAME="123"></A>preceded me in this post of honour, and increase the power of Persia as 
<A NAME="124"></A>much as any of them. And truly I have pondered upon this, until at last 
<A NAME="125"></A>I have found out a way whereby we may at once win glory, and likewise get 
<A NAME="126"></A>possession of a land which is as large and as rich as our own nay, which 
<A NAME="127"></A>is even more varied in the fruits it bears- while at the same time we obtain 
<A NAME="128"></A>satisfaction and revenge. For this cause I have now called you together, 
<A NAME="129"></A>that I may make known to you what I design to do. (SS 2.) My intent is 
<A NAME="130"></A>to throw a bridge over the Hellespont and march an army through Europe 
<A NAME="131"></A>against Greece, that thereby I may obtain vengeance from the Athenians 
<A NAME="132"></A>for the wrongs committed by them against the Persians and against my father. 
<A NAME="133"></A>Your own eyes saw the preparations of Darius against these men; but death 
<A NAME="134"></A>came upon him, and balked his hopes of revenge. In his behalf, therefore, 
<A NAME="135"></A>and in behalf of all the Persians, I undertake the war, and pledge myself 
<A NAME="136"></A>not to rest till I have taken and burnt Athens, which has dared, unprovoked, 
<A NAME="137"></A>to injure me and my father. Long since they came to Asia with Aristagoras 
<A NAME="138"></A>of Miletus, who was one of our slaves, and, entering Sardis, burnt its 
<A NAME="139"></A>temples and its sacred groves; again, more lately, when we made a landing 
<A NAME="140"></A>upon their coast under Datis and Artaphernes, how roughly they handled 
<A NAME="141"></A>us ye do not need to be told. (SS 3.) For these reasons, therefore, I am 
<A NAME="142"></A>bent upon this war; and I see likewise therewith united no few advantages. 
<A NAME="143"></A>Once let us subdue this people, and those neighbours of theirs who hold 
<A NAME="144"></A>the land of Pelops the Phrygian, and we shall extend the Persian territory 
<A NAME="145"></A>as far as God's heaven reaches. The sun will then shine on no land beyond 
<A NAME="146"></A>our borders; for I will pass through Europe from one end to the other, 
<A NAME="147"></A>and with your aid make of all the lands which it contains one country. 
<A NAME="148"></A>For thus, if what I hear be true, affairs stand: the nations whereof I 
<A NAME="149"></A>have spoken, once swept away, there is no city, no country left in all 
<A NAME="150"></A>the world, which will venture so much as to withstand us in arms. By this 
<A NAME="151"></A>course then we shall bring all mankind under our yoke, alike those who 
<A NAME="152"></A>are guilty and those who are innocent of doing us wrong. (SS 4.) For yourselves, 
<A NAME="153"></A>if you wish to please me, do as follows: when I announce the time for the 
<A NAME="154"></A>army to meet together, hasten to the muster with a good will, every one 
<A NAME="155"></A>of you; and know that to the man who brings with him the most gallant array 
<A NAME="156"></A>I will give the gifts which our people consider the most honourable. This 
<A NAME="157"></A>then is what ye have to do. But to show that I am not self-willed in this 
<A NAME="158"></A>matter, I lay the business before you, and give you full leave to speak 
<A NAME="159"></A>your minds upon it openly."
<A NAME="160"></A><BR><BR>Xerxes, having so spoken, held his peace.
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>(SS 1.) Whereupon Mardonius took the word, and said: "Of a truth, my 
<A NAME="162"></A>lord, thou dost surpass, not only all living Persians, but likewise those 
<A NAME="163"></A>yet unborn. Most true and right is each word that thou hast now uttered; 
<A NAME="164"></A>but best of all thy resolve not to let the Ionians who live in Europe- 
<A NAME="165"></A>a worthless crew- mock us any more. It were indeed a monstrous thing if, 
<A NAME="166"></A>after conquering and enslaving the Sacae, the Indians, the Ethiopians, 
<A NAME="167"></A>the Assyrians, and many other mighty nations, not for any wrong that they 
<A NAME="168"></A>had done us, but only to increase our empire, we should then allow the 
<A NAME="169"></A>Greeks, who have done us such wanton injury, to escape our vengeance. What 
<A NAME="170"></A>is it that we fear in them?- not surely their numbers?- not the greatness 
<A NAME="171"></A>of their wealth? We know the manner of their battle- we know how weak their 
<A NAME="172"></A>power is; already have we subdued their children who dwell in our country, 
<A NAME="173"></A>the Ionians, Aeolians, and Dorians. I myself have had experience of these 
<A NAME="174"></A>men when I marched against them by the orders of thy father; and though 
<A NAME="175"></A>I went as far as Macedonia, and came but a little short of reaching Athens 
<A NAME="176"></A>itself, yet not a soul ventured to come out against me to battle. (SS 2.) 
<A NAME="177"></A>And yet, I am told, these very Greeks are wont to wage wars against one 
<A NAME="178"></A>another in the most foolish way, through sheer perversity and doltishness. 
<A NAME="179"></A>For no sooner is war proclaimed than they search out the smoothest and 
<A NAME="180"></A>fairest plain that is to be found in all the land, and there they assemble 
<A NAME="181"></A>and fight; whence it comes to pass that even the conquerors depart with 
<A NAME="182"></A>great loss: I say nothing of the conquered, for they are destroyed altogether. 
<A NAME="183"></A>Now surely, as they are all of one speech, they ought to interchange heralds 
<A NAME="184"></A>and messengers, and make up their differences by any means rather than 
<A NAME="185"></A>battle; or, at the worst, if they must needs fight one against another, 
<A NAME="186"></A>they ought to post themselves as strongly as possible, and so try their 
<A NAME="187"></A>quarrels. But, notwithstanding that they have so foolish a manner of warfare, 
<A NAME="188"></A>yet these Greeks, when I led my army against them to the very borders of 
<A NAME="189"></A>Macedonia, did not so much as think of offering me battle. (SS 3.) Who 
<A NAME="190"></A>then will dare, O king! to meet thee in arms, when thou comest with all 
<A NAME="191"></A>Asia's warriors at thy back, and with all her ships? For my part I do not 
<A NAME="192"></A>believe the Greek people will be so foolhardy. Grant, however, that I am 
<A NAME="193"></A>mistaken herein, and that they are foolish enough to meet us in open fight; 
<A NAME="194"></A>in that case they will learn that there are no such soldiers in the whole 
<A NAME="195"></A>world as we. Nevertheless let us spare no pains; for nothing comes without 
<A NAME="196"></A>trouble; but all that men acquire is got by painstaking."
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>When Mardonius had in this way softened the harsh speech of Xerxes, 
<A NAME="198"></A>he too held his peace.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR>(SS 1.) The other Persians were silent; all feared to raise their 
<A NAME="200"></A>voice against the plan proposed to them. But Artabanus, the son of Hystaspes, 
<A NAME="201"></A>and uncle of Xerxes, trusting to his relationship, was bold to speak:- 
<A NAME="202"></A>"O king!" he said, "it is impossible, if no more than one opinion is uttered, 
<A NAME="203"></A>to make choice of the best: a man is forced then to follow whatever advice 
<A NAME="204"></A>may have been given him; but if opposite speeches are delivered, then choice 
<A NAME="205"></A>can be exercised. In like manner pure gold is not recognised by itself; 
<A NAME="206"></A>but when we test it along with baser ore, we perceive which is the better. 
<A NAME="207"></A>I counselled thy father, Darius, who was my own brother, not to attack 
<A NAME="208"></A>the Scyths, a race of people who had no town in their whole land. He thought 
<A NAME="209"></A>however to subdue those wandering tribes, and would not listen to me, but 
<A NAME="210"></A>marched an army against them, and ere he returned home lost many of his 
<A NAME="211"></A>bravest warriors. Thou art about, O king! to attack a people far superior 
<A NAME="212"></A>to the Scyths, a people distinguished above others both by land and sea. 
<A NAME="213"></A>'Tis fit therefore that I should tell thee what danger thou incurrest hereby. 
<A NAME="214"></A>(SS 2.) Thou sayest that thou wilt bridge the Hellespont, and lead thy 
<A NAME="215"></A>troops through Europe against Greece. Now suppose some disaster befall 
<A NAME="216"></A>thee by land or sea, or by both. It may be even so; for the men are reputed 
<A NAME="217"></A>valiant. Indeed one may measure their prowess from what they have already 
<A NAME="218"></A>done; for when Datis and Artaphernes led their huge army against Attica, 
<A NAME="219"></A>the Athenians singly defeated them. But grant they are not successful on 
<A NAME="220"></A>both elements. Still, if they man their ships, and, defeating us by sea, 
<A NAME="221"></A>sail to the Hellespont, and there destroy our bridge- that, sire, were 
<A NAME="222"></A>a fearful hazard. (SS 3.) And here 'tis not by my own mother wit alone 
<A NAME="223"></A>that I conjecture what will happen; but I remember how narrowly we escaped 
<A NAME="224"></A>disaster once, when thy father, after throwing bridges over the Thracian 
<A NAME="225"></A>Bosphorus and the Ister, marched against the Scythians, and they tried 
<A NAME="226"></A>every sort of prayer to induce the Ionians, who had charge of the bridge 
<A NAME="227"></A>over the Ister, to break the passage. On that day, if Histiaeus, the king 
<A NAME="228"></A>of Miletus, had sided with the other princes, and not set himself to oppose 
<A NAME="229"></A>their views, the empire of the Persians would have come to nought. Surely 
<A NAME="230"></A>a dreadful thing is this even to hear said, that the king's fortunes depended 
<A NAME="231"></A>wholly on one man.
<A NAME="232"></A><BR><BR>(SS 4.) "Think then no more of incurring so great a danger when 
<A NAME="233"></A>no need presses, but follow the advice I tender. Break up this meeting, 
<A NAME="234"></A>and when thou hast well considered the matter with thyself, and settled 
<A NAME="235"></A>what thou wilt do, declare to us thy resolve. I know not of aught in the 
<A NAME="236"></A>world that so profits a man as taking good counsel with himself; for even 
<A NAME="237"></A>if things fall out against one's hopes, still one has counselled well, 
<A NAME="238"></A>though fortune has made the counsel of none effect: whereas if a man counsels 
<A NAME="239"></A>ill and luck follows, he has gotten a windfall, but his counsel is none 
<A NAME="240"></A>the less silly. (SS 5.) Seest thou how God with his lightning smites always 
<A NAME="241"></A>the bigger animals, and will not suffer them to wax insolent, while those 
<A NAME="242"></A>of a lesser bulk chafe him not? How likewise his bolts fall ever on the 
<A NAME="243"></A>highest houses and the tallest trees? So plainly does He love to bring 
<A NAME="244"></A>down everything that exalts itself. Thus ofttimes a mighty host is discomfited 
<A NAME="245"></A>by a few men, when God in his jealousy sends fear or storm from heaven, 
<A NAME="246"></A>and they perish in a way unworthy of them. For God allows no one to have 
<A NAME="247"></A>high thoughts but Himself. (SS 6.) Again, hurry always brings about disasters, 
<A NAME="248"></A>from which huge sufferings are wont to arise; but in delay lie many advantages, 
<A NAME="249"></A>not apparent (it may be) at first sight, but such as in course of time 
<A NAME="250"></A>are seen of all. Such then is my counsel to thee, O 
<A NAME="251"></A>king!
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR>(SS 7.) "And thou, Mardonius, son of Gobryas, forbear to speak 
<A NAME="253"></A>foolishly concerning the Greeks, who are men that ought not to be lightly 
<A NAME="254"></A>esteemed by us. For while thou revilest the Greeks, thou dost encourage 
<A NAME="255"></A>the king to lead his own troops against them; and this, as it seems to 
<A NAME="256"></A>me, is what thou art specially striving to accomplish. Heaven send thou 
<A NAME="257"></A>succeed not to thy wish! For slander is of all evils the most terrible. 
<A NAME="258"></A>In it two men do wrong, and one man has wrong done to him. The slanderer 
<A NAME="259"></A>does wrong, forasmuch as he abuses a man behind his back; and the hearer, 
<A NAME="260"></A>forasmuch as he believes what he has not searched into thoroughly. The 
<A NAME="261"></A>man slandered in his absence suffers wrong at the hands of both: for one 
<A NAME="262"></A>brings against him a false charge; and the other thinks him an evildoer. 
<A NAME="263"></A>(SS 8.) If, however, it must needs be that we go to war with this people, 
<A NAME="264"></A>at least allow the king to abide at home in Persia. Then let thee and me 
<A NAME="265"></A>both stake our children on the issue, and do thou choose out thy men, and, 
<A NAME="266"></A>taking with thee whatever number of troops thou likest, lead forth our 
<A NAME="267"></A>armies to battle. If things go well for the king, as thou sayest they will, 
<A NAME="268"></A>let me and my children be put to death; but if they fall out as I prophesy, 
<A NAME="269"></A>let thy children suffer, and thyself too, if thou shalt come back alive. 
<A NAME="270"></A>But shouldest thou refuse this wager, and still resolve to march an army 
<A NAME="271"></A>against Greece, sure I am that some of those whom thou leavest behind thee 
<A NAME="272"></A>here will one day receive the sad tidings that Mardonius has brought a 
<A NAME="273"></A>great disaster upon the Persian people, and lies a prey to dogs and birds 
<A NAME="274"></A>somewhere in the land of the Athenians, or else in that of the Lacedaemonians; 
<A NAME="275"></A>unless indeed thou shalt have perished sooner by the way, experiencing 
<A NAME="276"></A>in thy own person the might of those men on whom thou wouldest fain induce 
<A NAME="277"></A>the king to make war."
<A NAME="278"></A><BR><BR>Thus spake Artabanus. But Xerxes, full of wrath, replied to 
<A NAME="279"></A>him:-
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>"Artabanus, thou art my father's brother- that shall save thee from 
<A NAME="281"></A>receiving the due meed of thy silly words. One shame however I will lay 
<A NAME="282"></A>upon thee, coward and faint-hearted as thou art- thou shalt not come with 
<A NAME="283"></A>me to fight these Greeks, but shalt tarry here with the women. Without 
<A NAME="284"></A>thy aid I will accomplish all of which I spake. For let me not be thought 
<A NAME="285"></A>the child of Darius, the son of Hystaspes, the son of Arsames, the son 
<A NAME="286"></A>of Ariaramnes, the son of Teispes, the son of Cyrus, the son of Cambyses, 
<A NAME="287"></A>the son of Teispes, the son of Achaemenes, if I take not vengeance on the 
<A NAME="288"></A>Athenians. Full well I know that, were we to remain at rest, yet would 
<A NAME="289"></A>not they, but would most certainly invade our country, if at least it be 
<A NAME="290"></A>right to judge from what they have already done; for, remember, it was 
<A NAME="291"></A>they who fired Sardis and attacked Asia. So now retreat is on both sides 
<A NAME="292"></A>impossible, and the choice lies between doing and suffering injury; either 
<A NAME="293"></A>our empire must pass under the dominion of the Greeks, or their land become 
<A NAME="294"></A>the prey of the Persians; for there is no middle course left in this quarrel. 
<A NAME="295"></A>It is right then that we, who have in times past received wrong, should 
<A NAME="296"></A>now avenge it, and that I should thereby discover what that great risk 
<A NAME="297"></A>is which I run in marching against these men- men whom Pelops the Phrygian, 
<A NAME="298"></A>a vassal of my forefathers, subdued so utterly, that to this day both the 
<A NAME="299"></A>land, and the people who dwell therein, alike bear the name of the 
<A NAME="300"></A>conqueror!"
<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR>Thus far did the speaking proceed. Afterwards evening fell; and 
<A NAME="302"></A>Xerxes began to find the advice of Artabanus greatly disquiet him. So he 
<A NAME="303"></A>thought upon it during the night, and concluded at last that it was not 
<A NAME="304"></A>for his advantage to lead an army into Greece. When he had thus made up 
<A NAME="305"></A>his mind anew, he fell asleep. And now he saw in the night, as the Persians 
<A NAME="306"></A>declare, a vision of this nature- he thought a tall and beautiful man stood 
<A NAME="307"></A>over him and said, "Hast thou then changed thy mind, Persian, and wilt 
<A NAME="308"></A>thou not lead forth thy host against the Greeks, after commanding the Persians 
<A NAME="309"></A>to gather together their levies? Be sure thou doest not well to change; 
<A NAME="310"></A>nor is there a man here who will approve thy conduct. The course that thou 
<A NAME="311"></A>didst determine on during the day, let that be followed." After thus speaking 
<A NAME="312"></A>the man seemed to Xerxes to fly away.
<A NAME="313"></A><BR><BR>Day dawned; and the king made no account of this dream, but called 
<A NAME="314"></A>together the same Persians as before, and spake to them as 
<A NAME="315"></A>follows:-
<A NAME="316"></A><BR><BR>"Men of Persia, forgive me if I alter the resolve to which I came 
<A NAME="317"></A>so lately. Consider that I have not yet reached to the full growth of my 
<A NAME="318"></A>wisdom, and that they who urge me to engage in this war leave me not to 
<A NAME="319"></A>myself for a moment. When I heard the advice of Artabanus, my young blood 
<A NAME="320"></A>suddenly boiled; and I spake words against him little befitting his years: 
<A NAME="321"></A>now however I confess my fault, and am resolved to follow his counsel. 
<A NAME="322"></A>Understand then that I have changed my intent with respect to carrying 
<A NAME="323"></A>war into Greece, and cease to trouble yourselves."
<A NAME="324"></A><BR><BR>When they heard these words, the Persians were full of joy, and, 
<A NAME="325"></A>falling down at the feet of Xerxes, made obeisance to 
<A NAME="326"></A>him.
<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR>But when night came, again the same vision stood over Xerxes as 
<A NAME="328"></A>he slept, and said, "Son of Darius, it seems thou hast openly before all 
<A NAME="329"></A>the Persians renounced the expedition, making light of my words, as though 
<A NAME="330"></A>thou hadst not heard them spoken. Know therefore and be well assured, that 
<A NAME="331"></A>unless thou go forth to the war, this thing shall happen unto thee thou 
<A NAME="332"></A>art grown mighty and puissant in a short space, so likewise shalt thou 
<A NAME="333"></A>within a little time be brought low indeed."
<A NAME="334"></A><BR><BR>Then Xerxes, greatly frightened at the vision which he had seen, 
<A NAME="335"></A>sprang from his couch, and sent a messenger to call Artabanus, who came 
<A NAME="336"></A>at the summons, when Xerxes spoke to him in these words:-
<A NAME="337"></A><BR><BR>"Artabanus, at the moment I acted foolishly, when I gave thee ill 
<A NAME="338"></A>words in return for thy good advice. However it was not long ere I repented, 
<A NAME="339"></A>and was convinced that thy counsel was such as I ought to follow. But I 
<A NAME="340"></A>may not now act in this way, greatly as I desire to do so. For ever since 
<A NAME="341"></A>I repented and changed my mind a dream has haunted me, which disapproves 
<A NAME="342"></A>my intentions, and has now just gone from me with threats. Now if this 
<A NAME="343"></A>dream is sent to me from God, and if it is indeed his will that our troops 
<A NAME="344"></A>should march against Greece, thou too wilt have the same dream come to 
<A NAME="345"></A>thee and receive the same commands as myself. And this will be most sure 
<A NAME="346"></A>to happen, I think, if thou puttest on the dress which I am wont to wear, 
<A NAME="347"></A>and then, after taking thy seat upon my throne, liest down to sleep on 
<A NAME="348"></A>my bed."
<A NAME="349"></A><BR><BR>Such were the words of Xerxes. Artabanus would not at first yield 
<A NAME="350"></A>to the command of the king; for he deemed himself unworthy to sit upon 
<A NAME="351"></A>the royal throne. At the last however he was forced to give way, and did 
<A NAME="352"></A>as Xerxes bade him; but first he spake thus to the king (SS 
<A NAME="353"></A>1.):-
<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR>"To me, sire, it seems to matter little whether a man is wise himself 
<A NAME="355"></A>or willing to hearken to such as give good advice. In thee truly are found 
<A NAME="356"></A>both but the counsels of evil men lead thee astray: they are like the gales 
<A NAME="357"></A>of wind which vex the sea- else the most useful thing for man in the whole 
<A NAME="358"></A>world- and suffer it not to follow the bent of its own nature. For myself, 
<A NAME="359"></A>it irked me not so much to be reproached by thee, as to observe that when 
<A NAME="360"></A>two courses were placed before the Persian people, one of a nature to increase 
<A NAME="361"></A>their pride, the other to humble it, by showing them how hurtful it is 
<A NAME="362"></A>to allow one's heart always to covet more than one at present possesses, 
<A NAME="363"></A>thou madest choice of that which was the worse both for thyself and for 
<A NAME="364"></A>the Persians. (SS 2.) Now thou sayest that from the time when thou didst 
<A NAME="365"></A>approve the better course, and give up the thought of warring against Greece, 
<A NAME="366"></A>a dream has haunted thee, sent by some god or other, which will not suffer 
<A NAME="367"></A>thee to lay aside the expedition. But such things, my son, have of a truth 
<A NAME="368"></A>nothing divine in them. The dreams that wander to and fro among mankind, 
<A NAME="369"></A>I will tell thee of what nature they are- I who have seen so many more 
<A NAME="370"></A>years than thou. Whatever a man has been thinking of during the day is 
<A NAME="371"></A>wont to hover round him in the visions of his dreams at night. Now we during 
<A NAME="372"></A>these many days past have had our hands full of this enterprise. (SS 3.) 
<A NAME="373"></A>If however the matter be not as I suppose, but God has indeed some part 
<A NAME="374"></A>therein, thou hast in brief declared the whole that can be said concerning 
<A NAME="375"></A>it- let it e'en appear to me as it has to thee, and lay on me the same 
<A NAME="376"></A>injunctions. But it ought not to appear to me any the more if I put on 
<A NAME="377"></A>thy clothes than if I wear my own, nor if I go to sleep in thy bed than 
<A NAME="378"></A>if I do so in mine- supposing, I mean, that it is about to appear at all. 
<A NAME="379"></A>For this thing, be it what it may, that visits thee in thy sleep, surely 
<A NAME="380"></A>is not so far gone in folly as to see me, and because I am dressed in thy 
<A NAME="381"></A>clothes, straightway to mistake me for thee. Now however our business is 
<A NAME="382"></A>to see if it will regard me as of small account, and not vouchsafe to appear 
<A NAME="383"></A>to me, whether I wear mine own clothes or thine, while it keeps on haunting 
<A NAME="384"></A>thee continually. If it does so, and appears often, I should myself say 
<A NAME="385"></A>that it was from God. For the rest, if thy mind is fixed, and it is not 
<A NAME="386"></A>possible to turn thee from thy design, but I must needs go and sleep in 
<A NAME="387"></A>thy bed, well and good, let it be even so; and when I have done as thou 
<A NAME="388"></A>wishest, then let the dream appear to me. Till such time, however, I shall 
<A NAME="389"></A>keep to my former opinion."
<A NAME="390"></A><BR><BR>Thus spake Artabanus; and when he had so said, thinking to show 
<A NAME="391"></A>Xerxes that his words were nought, he did according to his orders. Having 
<A NAME="392"></A>put on the garments which Xerxes was wont to wear and taken his seat upon 
<A NAME="393"></A>the royal throne, he lay down to sleep upon the king's own bed. As he slept, 
<A NAME="394"></A>there appeared to him the very same dream which had been seen by Xerxes; 
<A NAME="395"></A>it came and stood over Artabanus, and said:-
<A NAME="396"></A><BR><BR>"Thou art the man, then, who, feigning to be tender of Xerxes, 
<A NAME="397"></A>seekest to dissuade him from leading his armies against the Greeks! But 
<A NAME="398"></A>thou shalt not escape scathless, either now or in time to come, because 
<A NAME="399"></A>thou hast sought to prevent that which is fated to happen. As for Xerxes, 
<A NAME="400"></A>it has been plainly told to himself what will befall him, if he refuses 
<A NAME="401"></A>to perform my bidding."
<A NAME="402"></A><BR><BR>In such words, as Artabanus thought, the vision threatened him, 
<A NAME="403"></A>and then endeavoured to burn out his eyes with red-hot irons. At this he 
<A NAME="404"></A>shrieked, and, leaping from his couch, hurried to Xerxes, and, sitting 
<A NAME="405"></A>down at his side, gave him a full account of the vision; after which he 
<A NAME="406"></A>went on to speak in the words which follow:-
<A NAME="407"></A><BR><BR>"I, O King! am a man who have seen many mighty empires overthrown 
<A NAME="408"></A>by weaker ones; and therefore it was that I sought to hinder thee from 
<A NAME="409"></A>being quite carried away by thy youth; since I knew how evil a thing it 
<A NAME="410"></A>is to covet more than one possesses. I could remember the expedition of 
<A NAME="411"></A>Cyrus against the Massagetae, and what was the issue of it; I could recollect 
<A NAME="412"></A>the march of Cambyses against the Ethiops; I had taken part in the attack 
<A NAME="413"></A>of Darius upon the Scyths-bearing therefore all these things in mind, I 
<A NAME="414"></A>thought with myself that if thou shouldst remain at peace, all men would 
<A NAME="415"></A>deem thee fortunate. But as this impulse has plainly come from above, and 
<A NAME="416"></A>a heaven-sent destruction seems about to overtake the Greeks, behold, I 
<A NAME="417"></A>change to another mind, and alter my thoughts upon the matter. Do thou 
<A NAME="418"></A>therefore make known to the Persians what the god has declared, and bid 
<A NAME="419"></A>them follow the orders which were first given, and prepare their levies. 
<A NAME="420"></A>Be careful to act so that the bounty of the god may not be hindered by 
<A NAME="421"></A>slackness on thy part."
<A NAME="422"></A><BR><BR>Thus spake these two together; and Xerxes, being in good heart 
<A NAME="423"></A>on account of the vision, when day broke, laid all before the Persians; 
<A NAME="424"></A>while Artabanus, who had formerly been the only person openly to oppose 
<A NAME="425"></A>the expedition, now showed as openly that he favoured 
<A NAME="426"></A>it.
<A NAME="427"></A><BR><BR>After Xerxes had thus determined to go forth to the war, there 
<A NAME="428"></A>appeared to him in his sleep yet a third vision. The Magi were consulted 
<A NAME="429"></A>upon it, and said that its meaning reached to the whole earth, and that 
<A NAME="430"></A>all mankind would become his servants. Now the vision which the king saw 
<A NAME="431"></A>was this: he dreamt that he was crowned with a branch of an olive tree, 
<A NAME="432"></A>and that boughs spread out from the olive branch and covered the whole 
<A NAME="433"></A>earth; then suddenly the garland, as it lay upon his brow, vanished. So 
<A NAME="434"></A>when the Magi had thus interpreted the vision, straightway all the Persians 
<A NAME="435"></A>who were come together departed to their several governments, where each 
<A NAME="436"></A>displayed the greatest zeal, on the faith of the king's offers. For all 
<A NAME="437"></A>hoped to obtain for themselves the gifts which had been promised. And so 
<A NAME="438"></A>Xerxes gathered together his host, ransacking every corner of the 
<A NAME="439"></A>continent.
<A NAME="440"></A><BR><BR>Reckoning from the recovery of Egypt, Xerxes spent four full years 
<A NAME="441"></A>in collecting his host and making ready all things that were needful for 
<A NAME="442"></A>his soldiers. It was not till the close of the fifth year that he set forth 
<A NAME="443"></A>on his march, accompanied by a mighty multitude. For of all the armaments 
<A NAME="444"></A>whereof any mention has reached us, this was by far the greatest; insomuch 
<A NAME="445"></A>that no other expedition compared to this seems of any account, neither 
<A NAME="446"></A>that which Darius undertook against the Scythians, nor the expedition of 
<A NAME="447"></A>the Scythians (which the attack of Darius was designed to avenge), when 
<A NAME="448"></A>they, being in pursuit of the Cimmerians, fell upon the Median territory, 
<A NAME="449"></A>and subdued and held for a time almost the whole of Upper Asia; nor, again, 
<A NAME="450"></A>that of the Atridae against Troy, of which we hear in story; nor that of 
<A NAME="451"></A>the Mysians and Teucrians, which was still earlier, wherein these nations 
<A NAME="452"></A>crossed the Bosphorus into Europe, and, after conquering all Thrace, pressed 
<A NAME="453"></A>forward till they came to the Ionian Sea, while southward they reached 
<A NAME="454"></A>as far as the river Peneus.
<A NAME="455"></A><BR><BR>All these expeditions, and others, if such there were, are as nothing 
<A NAME="456"></A>compared with this. For was there a nation in all Asia which Xerxes did 
<A NAME="457"></A>not bring with him against Greece? Or was there a river, except those of 
<A NAME="458"></A>unusual size, which sufficed for his troops to drink? One nation furnished 
<A NAME="459"></A>ships; another was arrayed among the foot-soldiers; a third had to supply 
<A NAME="460"></A>horses; a fourth, transports for the horse and men likewise for the transport 
<A NAME="461"></A>service; a fifth, ships of war towards the bridges; a sixth, ships and 
<A NAME="462"></A>provisions.
<A NAME="463"></A><BR><BR>And in the first place, because the former fleet had met with so 
<A NAME="464"></A>great a disaster about Athos, preparations were made, by the space of about 
<A NAME="465"></A>three years, in that quarter. A fleet of triremes lay at Elaeus in the 
<A NAME="466"></A>Chersonese; and from this station detachments were sent by the various 
<A NAME="467"></A>nations whereof the army was composed, which relieved one another at intervals, 
<A NAME="468"></A>and worked at a trench beneath the lash of taskmasters; while the people 
<A NAME="469"></A>dwelling about Athos bore likewise a part in the labour. Two Persians, 
<A NAME="470"></A>Bubares, the son of Megabazus, and Artachaees, the son of Artaeus, superintended 
<A NAME="471"></A>the undertaking.
<A NAME="472"></A><BR><BR>Athos is a great and famous mountain, inhabited by men, and stretching 
<A NAME="473"></A>far out into the sea. Where the mountain ends towards the mainland it forms 
<A NAME="474"></A>a peninsula; and in this place there is a neck of land about twelve furlongs 
<A NAME="475"></A>across, the whole extent whereof, from the sea of the Acanthians to that 
<A NAME="476"></A>over against Torone, is a level plain, broken only by a few low hills. 
<A NAME="477"></A>Here, upon this isthmus where Athos ends, is Sand, a Greek city. Inside 
<A NAME="478"></A>of Sand, and upon Athos itself, are a number of towns, which Xerxes was 
<A NAME="479"></A>now employed in disjoining from the continent: these are Dium, Olophyxus, 
<A NAME="480"></A>Acrothoum, Thyssus, and Cleonae. Among these cities Athos was 
<A NAME="481"></A>divided.
<A NAME="482"></A><BR><BR>Now the manner in which they dug was the following: a line was 
<A NAME="483"></A>drawn across by the city of Sand; and along this the various nations parcelled 
<A NAME="484"></A>out among themselves the work to be done. When the trench grew deep, the 
<A NAME="485"></A>workmen at the bottom continued to dig, while others handed the earth, 
<A NAME="486"></A>as it was dug out, to labourers placed higher up upon ladders, and these 
<A NAME="487"></A>taking it, passed it on farther, till it came at last to those at the top, 
<A NAME="488"></A>who carried it off and emptied it away. All the other nations, therefore, 
<A NAME="489"></A>except the Phoenicians, had double labour; for the sides of the trench 
<A NAME="490"></A>fell in continually, as could not but happen, since they made the width 
<A NAME="491"></A>no greater at the top than it was required to be at the bottom. But the 
<A NAME="492"></A>Phoenicians showed in this the skill which they are wont to exhibit in 
<A NAME="493"></A>all their undertakings. For in the portion of the work which was allotted 
<A NAME="494"></A>to them they began by making the trench at the top twice as wide as the 
<A NAME="495"></A>prescribed measure, and then as they dug downwards approached the sides 
<A NAME="496"></A>nearer and nearer together, so that when they reached the bottom their 
<A NAME="497"></A>part of the work was of the same width as the rest. In a meadow near, there 
<A NAME="498"></A>was a place of assembly and a market; and hither great quantities of corn, 
<A NAME="499"></A>ready ground, were brought from Asia.
<A NAME="500"></A><BR><BR>It seems to me, when I consider this work, that Xerxes, in making 
<A NAME="501"></A>it, was actuated by a feeling of pride, wishing to display the extent of 
<A NAME="502"></A>his power, and to leave a memorial behind him to posterity. For notwithstanding 
<A NAME="503"></A>that it was open to him, with no trouble at all, to have had his ships 
<A NAME="504"></A>drawn across the isthmus, yet he issued orders that a canal should be made 
<A NAME="505"></A>through which the sea might flow, and that it should be of such a width 
<A NAME="506"></A>as would allow of two triremes passing through it abreast with the oars 
<A NAME="507"></A>in action. He likewise gave to the same persons who were set over the digging 
<A NAME="508"></A>of the trench, the task of making a bridge across the river 
<A NAME="509"></A>Strymon.
<A NAME="510"></A><BR><BR>While these things were in progress, he was having cables prepared 
<A NAME="511"></A>for his bridges, some of papyrus and some of white flax, a business which 
<A NAME="512"></A>he entrusted to the Phoenicians and the Egyptians. He likewise laid up 
<A NAME="513"></A>stores of provisions in divers places, to save the army and the beasts 
<A NAME="514"></A>of burthen from suffering want upon their march into Greece. He inquired 
<A NAME="515"></A>carefully about all the sites, and had the stores laid up in such as were 
<A NAME="516"></A>most convenient, causing them to be brought across from various parts of 
<A NAME="517"></A>Asia and in various ways, some in transports and others in merchantmen. 
<A NAME="518"></A>The greater portion was carried to Leuce-Acte, upon the Thracian coast; 
<A NAME="519"></A>some part, however, was conveyed to Tyrodiza, in the country of the Perinthians, 
<A NAME="520"></A>some to Doriscus, some to Eion upon the Strymon, and some to 
<A NAME="521"></A>Macedonia.
<A NAME="522"></A><BR><BR>During the time that all these labours were in progress, the land 
<A NAME="523"></A>army which had been collected was marching with Xerxes towards Sardis, 
<A NAME="524"></A>having started from Critalla in Cappadocia. At this spot all the host which 
<A NAME="525"></A>was about to accompany the king in his passage across the continent had 
<A NAME="526"></A>been bidden to assemble. And here I have it not in my power to mention 
<A NAME="527"></A>which of the satraps was adjudged to have brought his troops in the most 
<A NAME="528"></A>gallant array, and on that account rewarded by the king according to his 
<A NAME="529"></A>promise; for I do not know whether this matter ever came to a judgment. 
<A NAME="530"></A>But it is certain that the host of Xerxes, after crossing the river Halys, 
<A NAME="531"></A>marched through Phrygia till it reached the city of Celaenae. Here are 
<A NAME="532"></A>the sources of the river Maeander, and likewise of another stream of no 
<A NAME="533"></A>less size, which bears the name of Catarrhactes (or the Cataract); the 
<A NAME="534"></A>last-named river has its rise in the market-place of Celaenae, and empties 
<A NAME="535"></A>itself into the Maeander. Here, too, in this market-place, is hung up to 
<A NAME="536"></A>view the skin of the Silenus Marsyas, which Apollo, as the Phrygian story 
<A NAME="537"></A>goes, stripped off and placed there.
<A NAME="538"></A><BR><BR>Now there lived in this city a certain Pythius, the son of Atys, 
<A NAME="539"></A>a Lydian. This man entertained Xerxes and his whole army in a most magnificent 
<A NAME="540"></A>fashion, offering at the same time to give him a sum of money for the war. 
<A NAME="541"></A>Xerxes, upon the mention of money, turned to the Persians who stood by, 
<A NAME="542"></A>and asked of them, "Who is this Pythius, and what wealth has he, that he 
<A NAME="543"></A>should venture on such an offer as this?" They answered him, "This is the 
<A NAME="544"></A>man, O king! who gave thy father Darius the golden plane-tree, and likewise 
<A NAME="545"></A>the golden vine; and he is still the wealthiest man we know of in all the 
<A NAME="546"></A>world, excepting thee."
<A NAME="547"></A><BR><BR>Xerxes marvelled at these last words; and now, addressing Pythius 
<A NAME="548"></A>with his own lips, he asked him what the amount of his wealth really was. 
<A NAME="549"></A>Pythius answered as follows:-
<A NAME="550"></A><BR><BR>"O king! I will not hide this matter from thee, nor make pretence 
<A NAME="551"></A>that I do not know how rich I am; but as I know perfectly, I will declare 
<A NAME="552"></A>all fully before thee. For when thy journey was noised abroad, and I heard 
<A NAME="553"></A>thou wert coming down to the Grecian coast, straightway, as I wished to 
<A NAME="554"></A>give thee a sum of money for the war, I made count of my stores, and found 
<A NAME="555"></A>them to be two thousand talents of silver, and of gold four millions of 
<A NAME="556"></A>Daric staters, wanting seven thousand. All this I willingly make over to 
<A NAME="557"></A>thee as a gift; and when it is gone, my slaves and my estates in land will 
<A NAME="558"></A>be wealth enough for my wants."
<A NAME="559"></A><BR><BR>This speech charmed Xerxes, and he replied, "Dear Lydian, since 
<A NAME="560"></A>I left Persia there is no man but thou who has either desired to entertain 
<A NAME="561"></A>my army, or come forward of his own free will to offer me a sum of money 
<A NAME="562"></A>for the war. Thou hast done both the one and the other, feasting my troops 
<A NAME="563"></A>magnificently, and now making offer of a right noble sum. In return, this 
<A NAME="564"></A>is what I will bestow on thee. Thou shalt be my sworn friend from this 
<A NAME="565"></A>day; and the seven thousand staters which are wanting to make up thy four 
<A NAME="566"></A>millions I will supply, so that the full tale may be no longer lacking, 
<A NAME="567"></A>and that thou mayest owe the completion of the round sum to me. Continue 
<A NAME="568"></A>to enjoy all that thou hast acquired hitherto; and be sure to remain ever 
<A NAME="569"></A>such as thou now art. If thou dost, thou wilt not repent of it so long 
<A NAME="570"></A>as thy life endures."
<A NAME="571"></A><BR><BR>When Xerxes had so spoken and had made good his promises to Pythius, 
<A NAME="572"></A>he pressed forward upon his march; and passing Anaua, a Phrygian city, 
<A NAME="573"></A>and a lake from which salt is gathered, he came to Colossae, a Phrygian 
<A NAME="574"></A>city of great size, situated at a spot where the river Lycus plunges into 
<A NAME="575"></A>a chasm and disappears. This river, after running under ground a distance 
<A NAME="576"></A>of about five furlongs, reappears once more, and empties itself, like the 
<A NAME="577"></A>stream above mentioned, into the Maeander. Leaving Colossae, the army approached 
<A NAME="578"></A>the borders of Phrygia where it abuts on Lydia; and here they came to a 
<A NAME="579"></A>city called Cydrara, where was a pillar set up by Croesus, having an inscription 
<A NAME="580"></A>on it, showing the boundaries of the two countries.
<A NAME="581"></A><BR><BR>Where it quits Phrygia and enters Lydia the road separates; the 
<A NAME="582"></A>way on the left leads into Caria, while that on the right conducts to Sardis. 
<A NAME="583"></A>If you follow this route, you must cross the Maeander, and then pass by 
<A NAME="584"></A>the city Callatebus, where the men live who make honey out of wheat and 
<A NAME="585"></A>the fruit of the tamarisk. Xerxes, who chose this way, found here a plane-tree 
<A NAME="586"></A>so beautiful, that he presented it with golden ornaments, and put it under 
<A NAME="587"></A>the care of one of his Immortals. The day after, he entered the Lydian 
<A NAME="588"></A>capital.
<A NAME="589"></A><BR><BR>Here his first care was to send off heralds into Greece, who were 
<A NAME="590"></A>to prefer a demand for earth and water, and to require that preparations 
<A NAME="591"></A>should be made everywhere to feast the king. To Athens indeed and to Sparta 
<A NAME="592"></A>he sent no such demand; but these cities excepted, his messengers went 
<A NAME="593"></A>everywhere. Now the reason why he sent for earth and water to states which 
<A NAME="594"></A>had already refused was this: he thought that although they had refused 
<A NAME="595"></A>when Darius made the demand, they would now be too frightened to venture 
<A NAME="596"></A>to say him nay. So he sent his heralds, wishing to know for certain how 
<A NAME="597"></A>it would be.
<A NAME="598"></A><BR><BR>Xerxes, after this, made preparations to advance to Abydos, where 
<A NAME="599"></A>the bridge across the Hellespont from Asia to Europe was lately finished. 
<A NAME="600"></A>Midway between Sestos and Madytus in the Hellespontine Chersonese, and 
<A NAME="601"></A>right over against Abydos, there is a rocky tongue of land which runs out 
<A NAME="602"></A>for some distance into the sea. This is the place where no long time afterwards 
<A NAME="603"></A>the Greeks under Xanthippus, the son of Ariphron, took Artayctes the Persian, 
<A NAME="604"></A>who was at that time governor of Sestos, and nailed him living to a plank. 
<A NAME="605"></A>He was the Artayctes who brought women into the temple of Protesilaus at 
<A NAME="606"></A>Elaeus, and there was guilty of most unholy deeds.
<A NAME="607"></A><BR><BR>Towards this tongue of land then, the men to whom the business 
<A NAME="608"></A>was assigned carried out a double bridge from Abydos; and while the Phoenicians 
<A NAME="609"></A>constructed one line with cables of white flax, the Egyptians in the other 
<A NAME="610"></A>used ropes made of papyrus. Now it is seven furlongs across from Abydos 
<A NAME="611"></A>to the opposite coast. When, therefore, the channel had been bridged successfully, 
<A NAME="612"></A>it happened that a great storm arising broke the whole work to pieces, 
<A NAME="613"></A>and destroyed all that had been done.
<A NAME="614"></A><BR><BR>So when Xerxes heard of it he was full of wrath, and straightway 
<A NAME="615"></A>gave orders that the Hellespont should receive three hundred lashes, and 
<A NAME="616"></A>that a pair of fetters should be cast into it. Nay, I have even heard it 
<A NAME="617"></A>said that he bade the branders take their irons and therewith brand the 
<A NAME="618"></A>Hellespont. It is certain that he commanded those who scourged the waters 
<A NAME="619"></A>to utter, as they lashed them, these barbarian and wicked words: "Thou 
<A NAME="620"></A>bitter water, thy lord lays on thee this punishment because thou hast wronged 
<A NAME="621"></A>him without a cause, having suffered no evil at his hands. Verily King 
<A NAME="622"></A>Xerxes will cross thee, whether thou wilt or no. Well dost thou deserve 
<A NAME="623"></A>that no man should honour thee with sacrifice; for thou art of a truth 
<A NAME="624"></A>a treacherous and unsavoury river." While the sea was thus punished by 
<A NAME="625"></A>his orders, he likewise commanded that the overseers of the work should 
<A NAME="626"></A>lose their heads.
<A NAME="627"></A><BR><BR>Then they, whose business it was, executed the unpleasing task 
<A NAME="628"></A>laid upon them; and other master-builders were set over the work, who accomplished 
<A NAME="629"></A>it in the way which I will now describe.
<A NAME="630"></A><BR><BR>They joined together triremes and penteconters, 360 to support 
<A NAME="631"></A>the bridge on the side of the Euxine Sea, and 314 to sustain the other; 
<A NAME="632"></A>and these they placed at right angles to the sea, and in the direction 
<A NAME="633"></A>of the current of the Hellespont, relieving by these means the tension 
<A NAME="634"></A>of the shore cables. Having joined the vessels, they moored them with anchors 
<A NAME="635"></A>of unusual size, that the vessels of the bridge towards the Euxine might 
<A NAME="636"></A>resist the winds which blow from within the straits, and that those of 
<A NAME="637"></A>the more western bridge facing the Egean might withstand the winds which 
<A NAME="638"></A>set in from the south and from the south-east. A gap was left in the penteconters 
<A NAME="639"></A>in no fewer than three places, to afford a passage for such light craft 
<A NAME="640"></A>as chose to enter or leave the Euxine. When all this was done, they made 
<A NAME="641"></A>the cables taut from the shore by the help of wooden capstans. This time, 
<A NAME="642"></A>moreover, instead of using the two materials separately, they assigned 
<A NAME="643"></A>to each bridge six cables, two of which were of white flax, while four 
<A NAME="644"></A>were of papyrus. Both cables were of the same size and quality; but the 
<A NAME="645"></A>flaxen were the heavier, weighing not less than a talent the cubit. When 
<A NAME="646"></A>the bridge across the channel was thus complete, trunks of trees were sawn 
<A NAME="647"></A>into planks, which were out to the width of the bridge, and these were 
<A NAME="648"></A>laid side by side upon the tightened cables, and then fastened on the top. 
<A NAME="649"></A>This done, brushwood was brought, and arranged upon the planks, after which 
<A NAME="650"></A>earth was heaped upon the brushwood, and the whole trodden down into a 
<A NAME="651"></A>solid mass. Lastly a bulwark was set up on either side of this causeway, 
<A NAME="652"></A>of such a height as to prevent the sumpter-beasts and the horses from seeing 
<A NAME="653"></A>over it and taking fright at the water.
<A NAME="654"></A><BR><BR>And now when all was prepared- the bridges, and the works at Athos, 
<A NAME="655"></A>the breakwaters about the mouths of the cutting, which were made to hinder 
<A NAME="656"></A>the surf from blocking up the entrances, and the cutting itself; and when 
<A NAME="657"></A>the news came to Xerxes that this last was completely finished- then at 
<A NAME="658"></A>length the host, having first wintered at Sardis, began its march towards 
<A NAME="659"></A>Abydos, fully equipped, on the first approach of spring. At the moment 
<A NAME="660"></A>of departure, the sun suddenly quitted his seat in the heavens, and disappeared, 
<A NAME="661"></A>though there were no clouds in sight, but the sky was clear and serene. 
<A NAME="662"></A>Day was thus turned into night; whereupon Xerxes, who saw and remarked 
<A NAME="663"></A>the prodigy, was seized with alarm, and sending at once for the Magians, 
<A NAME="664"></A>inquired of them the meaning of the portent. They replied- "God is foreshowing 
<A NAME="665"></A>to the Greeks the destruction of their cities; for the sun foretells for 
<A NAME="666"></A>them, and the moon for us." So Xerxes, thus instructed, proceeded on his 
<A NAME="667"></A>way with great gladness of heart.
<A NAME="668"></A><BR><BR>The army had begun its march, when Pythius the Lydian, affrighted 
<A NAME="669"></A>at the heavenly portent, and emboldened by his gifts, came to Xerxes and 
<A NAME="670"></A>said- "Grant me, O my lord! a favour which is to thee a light matter, but 
<A NAME="671"></A>to me of vast account." Then Xerxes' who looked for nothing less than such 
<A NAME="672"></A>a prayer as Pythius in fact preferred, engaged to grant him whatever he 
<A NAME="673"></A>wished, and commanded him to tell his wish freely. So Pythius, full of 
<A NAME="674"></A>boldness, went on to say:-
<A NAME="675"></A><BR><BR>"O my lord! thy servant has five sons; and it chances that all 
<A NAME="676"></A>are called upon to join thee in this march against Greece. I beseech thee, 
<A NAME="677"></A>have compassion upon my years; and let one of my sons, the eldest, remain 
<A NAME="678"></A>behind, to be my prop and stay, and the guardian of my wealth. Take with 
<A NAME="679"></A>thee the other four; and when thou hast done all that is in thy heart, 
<A NAME="680"></A>mayest thou come back in safety."
<A NAME="681"></A><BR><BR>But Xerxes was greatly angered, and replied to him: "Thou wretch! 
<A NAME="682"></A>darest thou speak to me of thy son, when I am myself on the march against 
<A NAME="683"></A>Greece, with sons, and brothers, and kinsfolk, and friends? Thou, who art 
<A NAME="684"></A>my bond-slave, and art in duty bound to follow me with all thy household, 
<A NAME="685"></A>not excepting thy wife! Know that man's spirit dwelleth in his ears, and 
<A NAME="686"></A>when it hears good things, straightway it fills all his body with delight; 
<A NAME="687"></A>but no sooner does it hear the contrary than it heaves and swells with 
<A NAME="688"></A>passion. As when thou didst good deeds and madest good offers to me, thou 
<A NAME="689"></A>wert not able to boast of having outdone the king in bountifulness, so 
<A NAME="690"></A>now when thou art changed and grown impudent, thou shalt not receive all 
<A NAME="691"></A>thy deserts, but less. For thyself and four of thy five sons, the entertainment 
<A NAME="692"></A>which I had of thee shall gain protection; but as for him to whom thou 
<A NAME="693"></A>clingest above the rest, the forfeit of his life shall be thy punishment." 
<A NAME="694"></A>Having thus spoken, forthwith he commanded those to whom such tasks were 
<A NAME="695"></A>assigned to seek out the eldest of the sons of Pythius, and having cut 
<A NAME="696"></A>his body asunder, to place the two halves. one on the right, the other 
<A NAME="697"></A>on the left, of the great road, so that the army might march out between 
<A NAME="698"></A>them.
<A NAME="699"></A><BR><BR>Then the king's orders were obeyed; and the army marched out between 
<A NAME="700"></A>the two halves of the carcase. First of all went the baggage-bearers, and 
<A NAME="701"></A>the sumpter-beasts, and then a vast crowd of many nations mingled together 
<A NAME="702"></A>without any intervals, amounting to more than one half of the army. After 
<A NAME="703"></A>these troops an empty space was left, to separate between them and the 
<A NAME="704"></A>king. In front of the king went first a thousand horsemen, picked men of 
<A NAME="705"></A>the Persian nation- then spearmen a thousand, likewise chosen troops, with 
<A NAME="706"></A>their spearheads pointing towards the ground- next ten of the sacred horses 
<A NAME="707"></A>called Nisaean, all daintily caparisoned. (Now these horses are called 
<A NAME="708"></A>Nisaean, because they come from the Nisaean plain, a vast flat in Media, 
<A NAME="709"></A>producing horses of unusual size.) After the ten sacred horses came the 
<A NAME="710"></A>holy chariot of Jupiter, drawn by eight milk-white steeds, with the charioteer 
<A NAME="711"></A>on foot behind them holding the reins; for no mortal is ever allowed to 
<A NAME="712"></A>mount into the car. Next to this came Xerxes himself, riding in a chariot 
<A NAME="713"></A>drawn by Nisaean horses, with his charioteer, Patiramphes, the son of Otanes, 
<A NAME="714"></A>a Persian, standing by his side.
<A NAME="715"></A><BR><BR>Thus rode forth Xerxes from Sardis- but he was accustomed every 
<A NAME="716"></A>now and then, when the fancy took him, to alight from his chariot and travel 
<A NAME="717"></A>in a litter. Immediately behind the king there followed a body of a thousand 
<A NAME="718"></A>spearmen, the noblest and bravest of the Persians, holding their lances 
<A NAME="719"></A>in the usual manner- then came a thousand Persian horse, picked men- then 
<A NAME="720"></A>ten thousand, picked also after the rest, and serving on foot. Of these 
<A NAME="721"></A>last one thousand carried spears with golden pomegranates at their lower 
<A NAME="722"></A>end instead of spikes; and these encircled the other nine thousand, who 
<A NAME="723"></A>bore on their spears pomegranates of silver. The spearmen too who pointed 
<A NAME="724"></A>their lances towards the ground had golden pomegranates; and the thousand 
<A NAME="725"></A>Persians who followed close after Xerxes had golden apples. Behind the 
<A NAME="726"></A>ten thousand footmen came a body of Persian cavalry, likewise ten thousand; 
<A NAME="727"></A>after which there was again a void space for as much as two furlongs; and 
<A NAME="728"></A>then the rest of the army followed in a confused crowd.
<A NAME="729"></A><BR><BR>The march of the army, after leaving Lydia, was directed upon the 
<A NAME="730"></A>river Caicus and the land of Mysia. Beyond the Caius the road, leaving 
<A NAME="731"></A>Mount Cana upon the left, passed through the Atarnean plain, to the city 
<A NAME="732"></A>of Carina. Quitting this, the troops advanced across the plain of Thebe, 
<A NAME="733"></A>passing Adramyttium, and Antandrus, the Pelasgic city; then, holding Mount 
<A NAME="734"></A>Ida upon the left hand, it entered the Trojan territory. On this march 
<A NAME="735"></A>the Persians suffered some loss; for as they bivouacked during the night 
<A NAME="736"></A>at the foot of Ida, a storm of thunder and lightning burst upon them, and 
<A NAME="737"></A>killed no small number.
<A NAME="738"></A><BR><BR>On reaching the Scamander, which was the first stream, of all that 
<A NAME="739"></A>they had crossed since they left Sardis, whose water failed them and did 
<A NAME="740"></A>not suffice to satisfy the thirst of men and cattle, Xerxes ascended into 
<A NAME="741"></A>the Pergamus of Priam, since he had a longing to behold the place. When 
<A NAME="742"></A>he had seen everything, and inquired into all particulars, he made an offering 
<A NAME="743"></A>of a thousand oxen to the Trojan Minerva, while the Magians poured libations 
<A NAME="744"></A>to the heroes who were slain at Troy. The night after, a panic fell upon 
<A NAME="745"></A>the camp: but in the morning they set off with daylight, and skirting on 
<A NAME="746"></A>the left hand the towns Rhoeteum, Ophryneum, and Dardanus (which borders 
<A NAME="747"></A>on Abydos), on the right the Teucrians of Gergis, so reached 
<A NAME="748"></A>Abydos.
<A NAME="749"></A><BR><BR>Arrived here, Xerxes wished to look upon all his host; so as there 
<A NAME="750"></A>was a throne of white marble upon a hill near the city, which they of Abydos 
<A NAME="751"></A>had prepared beforehand, by the king's bidding, for his especial use, Xerxes 
<A NAME="752"></A>took his seat on it, and, gazing thence upon the shore below, beheld at 
<A NAME="753"></A>one view all his land forces and all his ships. While thus employed, he 
<A NAME="754"></A>felt a desire to behold a sailing-match among his ships, which accordingly 
<A NAME="755"></A>took place, and was won by the Phoenicians of Sidon, much to the joy of 
<A NAME="756"></A>Xerxes, who was delighted alike with the race and with his 
<A NAME="757"></A>army.
<A NAME="758"></A><BR><BR>And now, as he looked and saw the whole Hellespont covered with 
<A NAME="759"></A>the vessels of his fleet, and all the shore and every plain about Abydos 
<A NAME="760"></A>as full as possible of men, Xerxes congratulated himself on his good fortune; 
<A NAME="761"></A>but after a little while he wept.
<A NAME="762"></A><BR><BR>Then Artabanus, the king's uncle (the same who at the first so 
<A NAME="763"></A>freely spake his mind to the king, and advised him not to lead his army 
<A NAME="764"></A>against Greece), when he heard that Xerxes was in tears, went to him, and 
<A NAME="765"></A>said:-
<A NAME="766"></A><BR><BR>"How different, sire, is what thou art now doing, from what thou 
<A NAME="767"></A>didst a little while ago! Then thou didst congratulate thyself; and now, 
<A NAME="768"></A>behold! thou weepest."
<A NAME="769"></A><BR><BR>"There came upon me," replied he, "a sudden pity, when I thought 
<A NAME="770"></A>of the shortness of man's life, and considered that of all this host, so 
<A NAME="771"></A>numerous as it is, not one will be alive when a hundred years are gone 
<A NAME="772"></A>by."
<A NAME="773"></A><BR><BR>"And yet there are sadder things in life than that," returned the 
<A NAME="774"></A>other. "Short as our time is, there is no man, whether it be here among 
<A NAME="775"></A>this multitude or elsewhere, who is so happy, as not to have felt the wish- 
<A NAME="776"></A>I will not say once, but full many a time- that he were dead rather than 
<A NAME="777"></A>alive. Calamities fall upon us; sicknesses vex and harass us, and make 
<A NAME="778"></A>life, short though it be, to appear long. So death, through the wretchedness 
<A NAME="779"></A>of our life, is a most sweet refuge to our race: and God, who gives us 
<A NAME="780"></A>the tastes that we enjoy of pleasant times, is seen, in his very gift, 
<A NAME="781"></A>to be envious."
<A NAME="782"></A><BR><BR>"True," said Xerxes; "human life is even such as thou hast painted 
<A NAME="783"></A>it, O Artabanus! But for this very reason let us turn our thoughts from 
<A NAME="784"></A>it, and not dwell on what is so sad, when pleasant things are in hand. 
<A NAME="785"></A>Tell me rather, if the vision which we saw had not appeared so plainly 
<A NAME="786"></A>to thyself, wouldst thou have been still of the same mind as formerly, 
<A NAME="787"></A>and have continued to dissuade me from warring against Greece, or wouldst 
<A NAME="788"></A>thou at this time think differently? Come now, tell me this 
<A NAME="789"></A>honestly."
<A NAME="790"></A><BR><BR>"O king!" replied the other, "may the dream which hath appeared 
<A NAME="791"></A>to us have such issue as we both desire! For my own part, I am still full 
<A NAME="792"></A>of fear, and have scarcely power to control myself, when I consider all 
<A NAME="793"></A>our dangers, and especially when I see that the two things which are of 
<A NAME="794"></A>most consequence are alike opposed to thee."
<A NAME="795"></A><BR><BR>"Thou strange man!" said Xerxes in reply- "what, I pray thee, are 
<A NAME="796"></A>the two things thou speakest of? Does my land army seem to thee too small 
<A NAME="797"></A>in number, and will the Greeks, thinkest thou, bring into the field a more 
<A NAME="798"></A>numerous host? Or is it our fleet which thou deemest weaker than theirs? 
<A NAME="799"></A>Or art thou fearful on both accounts? If in thy judgment we fall short 
<A NAME="800"></A>in either respect, it were easy to bring together with all speed another 
<A NAME="801"></A>armament."
<A NAME="802"></A><BR><BR>"O king!" said Artabanus, "it is not possible that a man of understanding 
<A NAME="803"></A>should find fault with the size of thy army or the number of thy ships. 
<A NAME="804"></A>The more thou addest to these, the more hostile will those two things, 
<A NAME="805"></A>whereof I spake, become. Those two things are the land and the sea. In 
<A NAME="806"></A>all the wide sea there is not, I imagine, anywhere a harbour large enough 
<A NAME="807"></A>to receive thy vessels, in case a storm arise, and afford them a sure protection. 
<A NAME="808"></A>And yet thou wilt want, not one such harbour only, but many in succession, 
<A NAME="809"></A>along the entire coast by which thou art about to make thy advance. In 
<A NAME="810"></A>default then of such harbours, it is well to bear in mind that chances 
<A NAME="811"></A>rule men, and not men chances. Such is the first of the two dangers; and 
<A NAME="812"></A>now I will speak to thee of the second. The land will also be thine enemy; 
<A NAME="813"></A>for if no one resists thy advance, as thou proceedest farther and farther, 
<A NAME="814"></A>insensibly allured onwards (for who is ever sated with success?), thou 
<A NAME="815"></A>wilt find it more and more hostile. I mean this, that, should nothing else 
<A NAME="816"></A>withstand thee, yet the mere distance, becoming greater as time goes on, 
<A NAME="817"></A>will at last produce a famine. Methinks it is best for men, when they take 
<A NAME="818"></A>counsel, to be timorous, and imagine all possible calamities, but when 
<A NAME="819"></A>the time for action comes, then to deal boldly."
<A NAME="820"></A><BR><BR>Whereto Xerxes answered- "There is reason, O Artabanus! in everything 
<A NAME="821"></A>which thou hast said; but I pray thee, fear not all things alike, nor count 
<A NAME="822"></A>up every risk. For if in each matter that comes before us thou wilt look 
<A NAME="823"></A>to all possible chances, never wilt thou achieve anything. Far better is 
<A NAME="824"></A>it to have a stout heart always, and suffer one's share of evils, than 
<A NAME="825"></A>to be ever fearing what may happen, and never incur a mischance. Moreover, 
<A NAME="826"></A>if thou wilt oppose whatever is said by others, without thyself showing 
<A NAME="827"></A>us the sure course which we ought to take, thou art as likely to lead us 
<A NAME="828"></A>into failure as they who advise differently; for thou art but on a par 
<A NAME="829"></A>with them. And as for that sure course, how canst thou show it us when 
<A NAME="830"></A>thou art but a man? I do not believe thou canst. Success for the most part 
<A NAME="831"></A>attends those who act boldly, not those who weigh everything, and are slack 
<A NAME="832"></A>to venture. Thou seest to how great a height the power of Persia has now 
<A NAME="833"></A>reached- never would it have grown to this point if they who sate upon 
<A NAME="834"></A>the throne before me had been like-minded with thee, or even, though not 
<A NAME="835"></A>like-minded, had listened to councillors of such a spirit. 'Twas by brave 
<A NAME="836"></A>ventures that they extended their sway; for great empires can only be conquered 
<A NAME="837"></A>by great risks. We follow then the example of our fathers in making this 
<A NAME="838"></A>march; and we set forward at the best season of the year; so, when we have 
<A NAME="839"></A>brought Europe under us, we shall return, without suffering from want or 
<A NAME="840"></A>experiencing any other calamity. For while on the one hand we carry vast 
<A NAME="841"></A>stores of provisions with us, on the other we shall have the grain of all 
<A NAME="842"></A>the countries and nations that we attack; since our march is not directed 
<A NAME="843"></A>against a pastoral people, but against men who are tillers of the 
<A NAME="844"></A>ground."
<A NAME="845"></A><BR><BR>Then said Artabanus- "If, sire, thou art determined that we shall 
<A NAME="846"></A>not fear anything, at least hearken to a counsel which I wish to offer; 
<A NAME="847"></A>for when the matters in hand are so many, one cannot but have much to say. 
<A NAME="848"></A>Thou knowest that Cyrus the son of Cambyses reduced and made tributary 
<A NAME="849"></A>to the Persians all the race of the Ionians, except only those of Attica. 
<A NAME="850"></A>Now my advice is that thou on no account lead forth these men against their 
<A NAME="851"></A>fathers; since we are well able to overcome them without such aid. Their 
<A NAME="852"></A>choice, if we take them with us to the war, lies between showing themselves 
<A NAME="853"></A>the most wicked of men by helping to enslave their fatherland, or the most 
<A NAME="854"></A>righteous by joining in the struggle to keep it free. If then they choose 
<A NAME="855"></A>the side of injustice, they will do us but scant good; while if they determine 
<A NAME="856"></A>to act justly, they may greatly injure our host. Lay thou to heart the 
<A NAME="857"></A>old proverb, which says truly, 'The beginning and end of a matter are not 
<A NAME="858"></A>always seen at once.'
<A NAME="859"></A><BR><BR>"Artabanus," answered Xerxes, "there is nothing in all that thou 
<A NAME="860"></A>hast said, wherein thou art so wholly wrong as in this, that thou suspectest 
<A NAME="861"></A>the faith of the Ionians. Have they not given us the surest proof of their 
<A NAME="862"></A>attachment- a proof which thou didst thyself witness, and likewise all 
<A NAME="863"></A>those who fought with Darius against the Scythians? When it lay wholly 
<A NAME="864"></A>with them to save or to destroy the entire Persian army, they dealt by 
<A NAME="865"></A>us honourably and with good faith, and did us no hurt at all. Besides, 
<A NAME="866"></A>they will leave behind them in our country their wives, their children, 
<A NAME="867"></A>and their properties- can it then be conceived that they will attempt rebellion? 
<A NAME="868"></A>Have no fear, therefore, on this score; but keep a brave heart and uphold 
<A NAME="869"></A>my house and empire. To thee, and thee only, do I intrust my 
<A NAME="870"></A>sovereignty."
<A NAME="871"></A><BR><BR>After Xerxes had thus spoken, and had sent Artabanus away to return 
<A NAME="872"></A>to Susa, he summoned before him all the Persians of most repute, and when 
<A NAME="873"></A>they appeared, addressed them in these words:-
<A NAME="874"></A><BR><BR>"Persians, I have brought you together because I wished to exhort 
<A NAME="875"></A>you to behave bravely, and not to sully with disgrace the former achievements 
<A NAME="876"></A>of the Persian people, which are very great and famous. Rather let us one 
<A NAME="877"></A>and all, singly and jointly, exert ourselves to the uttermost; for the 
<A NAME="878"></A>matter wherein we are engaged concerns the common weal. Strain every nerve, 
<A NAME="879"></A>then, I beseech you, in this war. Brave warriors are the men we march against, 
<A NAME="880"></A>if report says true; and such that, if we conquer them, there is not a 
<A NAME="881"></A>people in all the world which will venture thereafter to with. stand our 
<A NAME="882"></A>arms. And now let us offer prayers to the gods who watch over the welfare 
<A NAME="883"></A>of Persia, and then cross the channel."
<A NAME="884"></A><BR><BR>All that day the preparations for the passage continued; and on 
<A NAME="885"></A>the morrow they burnt all kinds of spices upon the bridges, and strewed 
<A NAME="886"></A>the way with myrtle boughs, while they waited anxiously for the sun, which 
<A NAME="887"></A>they hoped to see as he rose. And now the sun appeared; and Xerxes took 
<A NAME="888"></A>a golden goblet and poured from it a libation into the sea, praying the 
<A NAME="889"></A>while with his face turned to the sun "that no misfortune might befall 
<A NAME="890"></A>him such as to hinder his conquest of Europe, until he had penetrated to 
<A NAME="891"></A>its uttermost boundaries." After he had prayed, he cast the golden cup 
<A NAME="892"></A>into the Hellespont, and with it a golden bowl, and a Persian sword of 
<A NAME="893"></A>the kind which they call acinaces. I cannot say for certain whether it 
<A NAME="894"></A>was as an offering to the sun-god that he threw these things into the deep, 
<A NAME="895"></A>or whether he had repented of having scourged the Hellespont, and thought 
<A NAME="896"></A>by his gifts to make amends to the sea for what he had 
<A NAME="897"></A>done.
<A NAME="898"></A><BR><BR>When, however, his offerings were made, the army began to cross; 
<A NAME="899"></A>and the foot-soldiers, with the horsemen, passed over by one of the bridges- 
<A NAME="900"></A>that (namely) which lay towards the Euxine- while the sumpter-beasts and 
<A NAME="901"></A>the camp-followers passed by the other, which looked on the Egean. Foremost 
<A NAME="902"></A>went the Ten Thousand Persians, all wearing garlands upon their heads; 
<A NAME="903"></A>and after them a mixed multitude of many nations. These crossed upon the 
<A NAME="904"></A>first day.
<A NAME="905"></A><BR><BR>On the next day the horsemen began the passage; and with them went 
<A NAME="906"></A>the soldiers who carried their spears with the point downwards, garlanded, 
<A NAME="907"></A>like the Ten Thousand;- then came the sacred horses and the sacred chariot; 
<A NAME="908"></A>next Xerxes with his lancers and the thousand horse; then the rest of the 
<A NAME="909"></A>army. At the same time the ships sailed over to the opposite shore. According, 
<A NAME="910"></A>however, to another account which I have heard, the king crossed the 
<A NAME="911"></A>last.
<A NAME="912"></A><BR><BR>As soon as Xerxes had reached the European side, he stood to contemplate 
<A NAME="913"></A>his army as they crossed under the lash. And the crossing continued during 
<A NAME="914"></A>seven days and seven nights, without rest or pause. 'Tis said that here, 
<A NAME="915"></A>after Xerxes had made the passage, a Hellespontian exclaimed-
<A NAME="916"></A><BR><BR>"Why, O Jove, dost thou, in the likeness of a Persian man, and 
<A NAME="917"></A>with the name of Xerxes instead of thine own, lead the whole race of mankind 
<A NAME="918"></A>to the destruction of Greece? It would have been as easy for thee to destroy 
<A NAME="919"></A>it without their aid!"
<A NAME="920"></A><BR><BR>When the whole army had crossed, and the troops were now upon their 
<A NAME="921"></A>march, a strange prodigy appeared to them, whereof the king made no account, 
<A NAME="922"></A>though its meaning was not difficult to conjecture. Now the prodigy was 
<A NAME="923"></A>this:- a mare brought forth a hare. Hereby it was shown plainly enough, 
<A NAME="924"></A>that Xerxes would lead forth his host against Greece with mighty pomp and 
<A NAME="925"></A>splendour, but, in order to reach again the spot from which he set out, 
<A NAME="926"></A>would have to run for his life. There had also been another portent, while 
<A NAME="927"></A>Xerxes was still at Sardis- a mule dropped a foal, neither male nor female; 
<A NAME="928"></A>but this likewise was disregarded.
<A NAME="929"></A><BR><BR>So Xerxes, despising the omens, marched forwards; and his land 
<A NAME="930"></A>army accompanied him. But the fleet held an opposite course, and, sailing 
<A NAME="931"></A>to the mouth of the Hellespont, made its way along the shore. Thus the 
<A NAME="932"></A>fleet proceeded westward, making for Cape Sarpedon, where the orders were 
<A NAME="933"></A>that it should await the coming up of the troops; but the land army marched 
<A NAME="934"></A>eastward along the Chersonese, leaving on the right the tomb of Helle, 
<A NAME="935"></A>the daughter of Athamas, and on the left the city of Cardia. Having passed 
<A NAME="936"></A>through the town which is called Agora, they skirted the shores of the 
<A NAME="937"></A>Gulf of Melas, and then crossed the river Melas, whence the gulf takes 
<A NAME="938"></A>its name, the waters of which they found too scanty to supply the host. 
<A NAME="939"></A>From this point their march was to the west; and after passing Aenos, an 
<A NAME="940"></A>Aeolian settlement, and likewise Lake Stentoris, they came to 
<A NAME="941"></A>Doriscus.
<A NAME="942"></A><BR><BR>The name Doriscus is given to a beach and a vast plain upon the 
<A NAME="943"></A>coast of Thrace, through the middle of which flows the strong stream of 
<A NAME="944"></A>the Hebrus. Here was the royal fort which is likewise called Doriscus, 
<A NAME="945"></A>where Darius had maintained a Persian garrison ever since the time when 
<A NAME="946"></A>he attacked the Scythians. This place seemed to Xerxes a convenient spot 
<A NAME="947"></A>for reviewing and numbering his soldiers; which things accordingly he proceeded 
<A NAME="948"></A>to do. The sea-captains, who had brought the fleet to Doriscus, were ordered 
<A NAME="949"></A>to take the vessels to the beach adjoining, where Sale stands, a city of 
<A NAME="950"></A>the Samothracians, and Zone, another city. The beach extends to Serrheum, 
<A NAME="951"></A>the well-known promontory; the whole district in former times was inhabited 
<A NAME="952"></A>by the Ciconians. Here then the captains were to bring their ships, and 
<A NAME="953"></A>to haul them ashore for refitting, while Xerxes at Doriscus was employed 
<A NAME="954"></A>in numbering the soldiers.
<A NAME="955"></A><BR><BR>What the exact number of the troops of each nation was I cannot 
<A NAME="956"></A>say with certainty- for it is not mentioned by any one- but the whole land 
<A NAME="957"></A>army together was found to amount to one million seven hundred thousand 
<A NAME="958"></A>men. The manner in which the numbering took place was the following. A 
<A NAME="959"></A>body of ten thousand men was brought to a certain place, and the men were 
<A NAME="960"></A>made to stand as close together as possible; after which a circle was drawn 
<A NAME="961"></A>around them, and the men were let go: then where the circle had been, a 
<A NAME="962"></A>fence was built about the height of a man's middle; and the enclosure was 
<A NAME="963"></A>filled continually with fresh troops, till the whole army had in this way 
<A NAME="964"></A>been numbered. When the numbering was over, the troops were drawn up according 
<A NAME="965"></A>to their several nations.
<A NAME="966"></A><BR><BR>Now these were the nations that took part in this expedition. The 
<A NAME="967"></A>Persians, who wore on their heads the soft hat called the tiara, and about 
<A NAME="968"></A>their bodies, tunics with sleeves of divers colours, having iron scales 
<A NAME="969"></A>upon them like the scales of a fish. Their legs were protected by trousers; 
<A NAME="970"></A>and they bore wicker shields for bucklers; their quivers hanging at their 
<A NAME="971"></A>backs, and their arms being a short spear, a bow of uncommon size, and 
<A NAME="972"></A>arrows of reed. They had likewise daggers suspended from their girdles 
<A NAME="973"></A>along their right thighs. Otanes, the father of Xerxes' wife, Amestris, 
<A NAME="974"></A>was their leader. This people was known to the Greeks in ancient times 
<A NAME="975"></A>by the name of Cephenians; but they called themselves and were called by 
<A NAME="976"></A>their neighbours, Artaeans. It was not till Perseus, the son of Jove and 
<A NAME="977"></A>Danae, visited Cepheus the son of Belus, and, marrying his daughter Andromeda, 
<A NAME="978"></A>had by her a son called Perses (whom he left behind him in the country 
<A NAME="979"></A>because Cepheus had no male offspring), that the nation took from this 
<A NAME="980"></A>Perses the name of Persians.
<A NAME="981"></A><BR><BR>The Medes had exactly the same equipment as the Persians; and indeed 
<A NAME="982"></A>the dress common to both is not so much Persian as Median. They had for 
<A NAME="983"></A>commander Tigranes, of the race of the Achaemenids. These Medes were called 
<A NAME="984"></A>anciently by all people Arians; but when Media, the Colchian, came to them 
<A NAME="985"></A>from Athens, they changed their name. Such is the account which they themselves 
<A NAME="986"></A>give.
<A NAME="987"></A><BR><BR>The Cissians were equipped in the Persian fashion, except in one 
<A NAME="988"></A>respect:- they wore on their heads, instead of hats, fillets. Anaphes, 
<A NAME="989"></A>the son of Otanes, commanded them.
<A NAME="990"></A><BR><BR>The Hyrcanians were likewise armed in the same way as the Persians. 
<A NAME="991"></A>Their leader was Megapanus, the same who was afterwards satrap of 
<A NAME="992"></A>Babylon.
<A NAME="993"></A><BR><BR>The Assyrians went to the war with helmets upon their heads made 
<A NAME="994"></A>of brass, and plaited in a strange fashion which it is not easy to describe. 
<A NAME="995"></A>They carried shields, lances, and daggers very like the Egyptian; but in 
<A NAME="996"></A>addition, they had wooden clubs knotted with iron, and linen corselets. 
<A NAME="997"></A>This people, whom the Greeks call Syrians, are called Assyrians by the 
<A NAME="998"></A>barbarians. The Chaldaeans served in their ranks, and they had for commander 
<A NAME="999"></A>Otaspes, the son of Artachaeus.
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR><BR>The Bactrians went to the war wearing a head-dress very like the 
<A NAME="1001"></A>Median, but armed with bows of cane, after the custom of their country, 
<A NAME="1002"></A>and with short spears.
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR><BR>The Sacae, or Scyths, were clad in trousers, and had on their heads 
<A NAME="1004"></A>tall stiff caps rising to a point. They bore the bow of their country and 
<A NAME="1005"></A>the dagger; besides which they carried the battle-axe, or sagaris. They 
<A NAME="1006"></A>were in truth Amyrgian Scythians, but the Persians called them Sacae, since 
<A NAME="1007"></A>that is the name which they give to all Scythians. The Bactrians and the 
<A NAME="1008"></A>Sacae had for leader Hystaspes, the son of Darius and of Atossa, the daughter 
<A NAME="1009"></A>of Cyrus.
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR><BR>The Indians wore cotton dresses, and carried bows of cane, and 
<A NAME="1011"></A>arrows also of cane with iron at the point. Such was the equipment of the 
<A NAME="1012"></A>Indians, and they marched under the command of Pharnazathres the son of 
<A NAME="1013"></A>Artabates.
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR><BR>The Arians carried Median bows, but in other respects were equipped 
<A NAME="1015"></A>like the Bactrians. Their commander was Sisamnes the son of 
<A NAME="1016"></A>Hydarnes.
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR><BR>The Parthians and Chorasmians, with the Sogdians, the Gandarians, 
<A NAME="1018"></A>and the Dadicae, had the Bactrian equipment in all respects. The Parthians 
<A NAME="1019"></A>and Chorasmians were commanded by Artabazus the son of Pharnaces, the Sogdians 
<A NAME="1020"></A>by Azanes the son of Artaeus, and the Gandarians and Dadicae by Artyphius 
<A NAME="1021"></A>the son of Artabanus.
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR><BR>The Caspians were clad in cloaks of skin, and carried the cane 
<A NAME="1023"></A>bow of their country and the scymitar. So equipped they went to the war; 
<A NAME="1024"></A>and they had for commander Ariomardus the brother of 
<A NAME="1025"></A>Artyphius.
<A NAME="1026"></A><BR><BR>The Sarangians had dyed garments which showed brightly, and buskins 
<A NAME="1027"></A>which reached to the knee: they bore Median bows, and lances. Their leader 
<A NAME="1028"></A>was Pherendates, the son of Megabazus.
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR><BR>The Pactyans wore cloaks of skin, and carried the bow of their 
<A NAME="1030"></A>country and the dagger. Their commander was Artyntes, the son of 
<A NAME="1031"></A>Ithamatres.
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR><BR>The Utians, the Mycians, and the Paricanians were all equipped 
<A NAME="1033"></A>like the Pactyans. They had for leaders, Arsamenes, the son of Darius, 
<A NAME="1034"></A>who commanded the Utians and Mycians; and Siromitres, the son of Oeobazus, 
<A NAME="1035"></A>who commanded the Paricanians.
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR><BR>The Arabians wore the zeira, or long cloak, fastened about them 
<A NAME="1037"></A>with a girdle; and carried at their right side long bows, which when unstrung 
<A NAME="1038"></A>bent backwards.
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR><BR>The Ethiopians were clothed in the skins of leopards and lions, 
<A NAME="1040"></A>and had long bows made of the stem of the palm-leaf, not less than four 
<A NAME="1041"></A>cubits in length. On these they laid short arrows made of reed, and armed 
<A NAME="1042"></A>at the tip, not with iron, but with a piece of stone, sharpened to a point, 
<A NAME="1043"></A>of the kind used in engraving seals. They carried likewise spears, the 
<A NAME="1044"></A>head of which was the sharpened horn of an antelope; and in addition they 
<A NAME="1045"></A>had knotted clubs. When they went into battle they painted their bodies, 
<A NAME="1046"></A>half with chalk, and half with vermilion. The Arabians, and the Ethiopians 
<A NAME="1047"></A>who came from the region above Egypt, were commanded by Arsames, the son 
<A NAME="1048"></A>of Darius and of Artystone daughter of Cyrus. This Artystone was the best-beloved 
<A NAME="1049"></A>of all the wives of Darius; and it was she whose statue he caused to be 
<A NAME="1050"></A>made of gold wrought with the hammer. Her son Arsames commanded these two 
<A NAME="1051"></A>nations.
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR><BR>The eastern Ethiopians- for two nations of this name served in 
<A NAME="1053"></A>the army- were marshalled with the Indians. They differed in nothing from 
<A NAME="1054"></A>the other Ethiopians, save in their language, and the character of their 
<A NAME="1055"></A>hair. For the eastern Ethiopians have straight hair, while they of Libya 
<A NAME="1056"></A>are more woolly-haired than any other people in the world. Their equipment 
<A NAME="1057"></A>was in most points like that of the Indians; but they wore upon their heads 
<A NAME="1058"></A>the scalps of horses, with the ears and mane attached; the ears were made 
<A NAME="1059"></A>to stand upright, and the mane served as a crest. For shields this people 
<A NAME="1060"></A>made use of the skins of cranes.
<A NAME="1061"></A><BR><BR>The Libyans wore a dress of leather, and carried javelins made 
<A NAME="1062"></A>hard in the fire. They had for commander Massages, the son of 
<A NAME="1063"></A>Oarizus.
<A NAME="1064"></A><BR><BR>The Paphlagonians went to the war with plaited helmets upon their 
<A NAME="1065"></A>heads, and carrying small shields and spears of no great size. They had 
<A NAME="1066"></A>also javelins and daggers, and wore on their feet the buskin of their country, 
<A NAME="1067"></A>which reached half way up the shank. In the same fashion were equipped 
<A NAME="1068"></A>the Ligyans, the Matienians, the Mariandynians, and the Syrians (or Cappadocians, 
<A NAME="1069"></A>as they are called by the Persians). The Paphlagonians and Matienians were 
<A NAME="1070"></A>under the command of Dotus the son of Megasidrus; while the Mariandynians, 
<A NAME="1071"></A>the Ligyans, and the Syrians had for leader Gobryas, the son of Darius 
<A NAME="1072"></A>and Artystone.
<A NAME="1073"></A><BR><BR>The dress of the Phrygians closely resembled the Paphlagonian, 
<A NAME="1074"></A>only in a very few points differing from it. According to the Macedonian 
<A NAME="1075"></A>account, the Phrygians, during the time that they had their abode in Europe 
<A NAME="1076"></A>and dwelt with them in Macedonia, bore the name of Brigians; but on their 
<A NAME="1077"></A>removal to Asia they changed their designation at the same time with their 
<A NAME="1078"></A>dwelling-place.
<A NAME="1079"></A><BR><BR>The Armenians, who are Phrygian colonists, were armed in the Phrygian
