<A NAME="25"></A><I>swinging the lantern, which is to be a signal for the other women; in 
<A NAME="26"></A>high tragic style</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="27"></A>Oh! Thou shining light of my earthenware lamp, from this high spot shalt 
<A NAME="28"></A>thou look abroad. Oh! lamp, I will tell thee thine origin and thy future; 
<A NAME="29"></A>'tis the rapid whirl of the potter's wheel that has lent thee thy shape, 
<A NAME="30"></A>and thy wick counterfeits the glory of the sun; mayst thou send the agreed 
<A NAME="31"></A>signal flashing afar! In thee alone do we confide, and thou art worthy, 
<A NAME="32"></A>for thou art near us when we practise the various postures in which Aphrodite 
<A NAME="33"></A>delights upon our couches, and none dreams even in the midst of her sports 
<A NAME="34"></A>of seeking to avoid thine eye that watches us. Thou alone shinest into 
<A NAME="35"></A>the secret recesses of our thighs and dost singe the hair that groweth 
<A NAME="36"></A>there, and with thy flame dost light the actions of our loves. If we open 
<A NAME="37"></A>some cellar stored with fruits and wine, thou art our companion, and never 
<A NAME="38"></A>dost thou betray or reveal to a neighbour the secrets thou hast learned 
<A NAME="39"></A>about us. Therefore thou shalt know likewise the whole of the plot that 
<A NAME="40"></A>I have planned with my friends, the women, at the festival of the Scirophoria. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="41"></A><I>She pauses and looks about her.</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="42"></A>I see none of those I was expecting, though dawn approaches; the Assembly 
<A NAME="43"></A>is about to gather and we must take our seats in spite of Phyromachus, 
<A NAME="44"></A>who forsooth would say, "It is meet the women sit apart and hidden from 
<A NAME="45"></A>the eyes of the men." Why, have they not been able then to procure the 
<A NAME="46"></A>false beards that they must wear, or to steal their husbands' cloaks? Ah! 
<A NAME="47"></A>I see a light approaching; let us draw somewhat aside, for fear it should 
<A NAME="48"></A>be a man. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="49"></A><I>She hides in the alley. From the right a woman enters, followed almost 
<A NAME="50"></A>immediately by others. All are carrying staffs, men's sandals, and cloaks 
<A NAME="51"></A>over their arms.</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="52"></A><B>FIRST WOMAN</B>
<A NAME="53"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Let us start, it is high time; as we left our dwellings, the 
<A NAME="54"></A>cock was crowing for the second time. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="55"></A><B>PRAXAGORA </B>
<A NAME="56"></A><I>to herself</I><BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="57"></A>And I have spent the whole night waiting for you.  </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="58"></A><I>She emerges from the alley.</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="59"></A>But come, let us call our neighbour by scratching at her door; and gently 
<A NAME="60"></A>too, so that her husband may hear nothing. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="61"></A><B>SECOND WOMAN</B>
<A NAME="62"></A><I>coming out of her house; she is dressed like a man, with a staff in 
<A NAME="63"></A>her hand</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="64"></A>I was putting on my shoes, when I heard you scratching, for I was not asleep, 
<A NAME="65"></A>so there! Oh! my dear, my husband (he is a Salaminian) never left me an 
<A NAME="66"></A>instant's peace, but was at me, for ever at me, all night long, so that 
<A NAME="67"></A>it was only just now that I was able to filch his cloak. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="68"></A><B>PRAXAGORA</B>
<A NAME="69"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I see Clinarete coming too, along with Sostrate and their next-door 
<A NAME="70"></A>neighbour Philaenete.  </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="71"></A><I>To the women that are just arriving; in a loud voice</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="72"></A>Hurry yourselves then, for Glyce has sworn that the last comer shall forfeit 
<A NAME="73"></A>three measures of wine and a choenix of pease. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="74"></A><B>SECOND WOMAN</B>
<A NAME="75"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Don't you see Melistice, the wife of Smicythion, hurrying hither 
<A NAME="76"></A>in her big shoes? I think she is the only one of us all who has had no 
<A NAME="77"></A>trouble in getting rid of her husband. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="78"></A><B>FIRST WOMAN</B>
<A NAME="79"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>And can't you see Geusistrate, the tavern-keeper's wife, with 
<A NAME="80"></A>a lamp in her hand? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="81"></A><B>PRAXAGORA</B>
<A NAME="82"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>And the wives of Philodoretus and Chaeretades, and a great 
<A NAME="83"></A>many others; all the useful people in the city, in fact. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="84"></A><B>THIRD WOMAN</B>
<A NAME="85"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Oh! my dear, I have had such trouble in getting away! My husband 
<A NAME="86"></A>ate such a surfeit of sprats last evening that he was coughing and choking 
<A NAME="87"></A>the whole night long. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="88"></A><B>PRAXAGORA</B>
<A NAME="89"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Take your seats, and, since you are all gathered here at last, 
<A NAME="90"></A>let us see if what we decided on at the feast of the Scirophoria has been 
<A NAME="91"></A>duly done. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="92"></A><B>FIRST WOMAN</B>
<A NAME="93"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Yes. Firstly, as agreed, I have let the hair under my armpits 
<A NAME="94"></A>grow thicker than a bush; furthermore, whilst my husband was at the Assembly, 
<A NAME="95"></A>I rubbed myself from head to foot with oil and then stood the whole day 
<A NAME="96"></A>long in the sun. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="97"></A><B>SECOND WOMAN</B>
<A NAME="98"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>So did I. I began by throwing away my razor, so that I might 
<A NAME="99"></A>get quite hairy, and no longer resemble a woman. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="100"></A><B>PRAXAGORA</B>
<A NAME="101"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Have you the beards that we had all to get ourselves for the 
<A NAME="102"></A>Assembly? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="103"></A><B>FIRST WOMAN</B>
<A NAME="104"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Yea, by Hecate! Is this not a fine one? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="105"></A><B>SECOND WOMAN</B>
<A NAME="106"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Aye, much finer even than the one Epicrates has. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="107"></A><B>PRAXAGORA </B>
<A NAME="108"></A><I>to the other women</I><BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="109"></A>And you? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="110"></A><B>FIRST WOMAN</B>
<A NAME="111"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Yes, yes; look, they all nod assent. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="112"></A><B>PRAXAGORA</B>
<A NAME="113"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I see that you have got all the rest too, Spartan shoes, staffs 
<A NAME="114"></A>and men's cloaks, as it was arranged. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="115"></A><B>FIRST WOMAN</B>
<A NAME="116"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I have brought Lamias' club, which I stole from him while he 
<A NAME="117"></A>slept. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="118"></A><B>PRAXAGORA</B>
<A NAME="119"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>What, the club that makes him fart with its weight? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="120"></A><B>SECOND WOMAN</B>
<A NAME="121"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>By Zeus the Deliverer, if he had the skin of Argus, he would 
<A NAME="122"></A>know better than any other how to shepherd the popular herd. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="123"></A><B>PRAXAGORA</B>
<A NAME="124"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>But come, let us finish what has yet to be done, while the 
<A NAME="125"></A>stars are still shining; the Assembly, at which we mean to be present, 
<A NAME="126"></A>will open at dawn. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="127"></A><B>FIRST WOMAN</B>
<A NAME="128"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Good; you must take up your place at the foot of the platform 
<A NAME="129"></A>and facing the Prytanes. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="130"></A><B>SECOND WOMAN</B>
<A NAME="131"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I have brought this with me to card during the Assembly. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="132"></A><I>She shows some wool.</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="133"></A><B>PRAXAGORA</B>
<A NAME="134"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>During the Assembly, wretched woman? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="135"></A><B>SECOND WOMAN</B>
<A NAME="136"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Surely, by Artemis! shall I hear any less well if I am doing 
<A NAME="137"></A>a bit of carding? My little ones are all but naked. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="138"></A><B>PRAXAGORA</B>
<A NAME="139"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Think of her wanting to card! whereas we must not let anyone 
<A NAME="140"></A>see the smallest part of our bodies. 'Twould be a fine thing if one of 
<A NAME="141"></A>us, in the midst of the discussion, rushed on to the speaker's platform 
<A NAME="142"></A>and, flinging her cloak aside, showed her Phormisius. If, on the other 
<A NAME="143"></A>hand, we are the first to take our seats closely muffled in our cloaks, 
<A NAME="144"></A>none will know us. Let us fix these beards on our chins, so that they spread 
<A NAME="145"></A>all over our bosoms. How can we fail then to be mistaken for men? Agyrrhius 
<A NAME="146"></A>has deceived everyone, thanks to the beard of Pronomus; yet he was no better 
<A NAME="147"></A>than a woman, and you see how he now holds the first position in the city. 
<A NAME="148"></A>Thus, I adjure you by this day that is about to dawn, let us dare to copy 
<A NAME="149"></A>him and let us be clever enough to possess ourselves of the management 
<A NAME="150"></A>of affairs. Let us save the ship of state, which just at present none seems 
<A NAME="151"></A>able either to sail or row. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="152"></A><B>FIRST WOMAN </B>
<A NAME="153"></A><I>in a tragic style</I><BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="154"></A>But where shall we find orators in an Assembly of women? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="155"></A><B>PRAXAGORA</B>
<A NAME="156"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Nothing simpler. Is it not said that the cleverest speakers 
<A NAME="157"></A>are those who get made love to most often? Well, thanks to the gods, we 
<A NAME="158"></A>are that by nature. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="159"></A><B>FIRST WOMAN</B>
<A NAME="160"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>There's no doubt of that; but the worst of it is our inexperience. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="161"></A><B>PRAXAGORA</B>
<A NAME="162"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>That's the very reason we are gathered here, in order to prepare 
<A NAME="163"></A>the speech we must make in the Assembly. Hasten, therefore, all you who 
<A NAME="164"></A>know aught of speaking, to fix on your beards. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="165"></A><B>SECOND WOMAN</B>
<A NAME="166"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Oh you stupid thing! is there ever a one among us cannot use 
<A NAME="167"></A>her tongue? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="168"></A><B>PRAXAGORA</B>
<A NAME="169"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Come, look sharp, on with your beard and become a man. As for 
<A NAME="170"></A>me, I will do the same in case I should have a fancy for getting on to 
<A NAME="171"></A>the platform. Here are the chaplets. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="172"></A><I>They all put on their beards.</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="173"></A><B>SECOND WOMAN</B>
<A NAME="174"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Oh! great gods! my dear Praxagora, do look here! Is it not 
<A NAME="175"></A>laughable? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="176"></A><B>PRAXAGORA</B>
<A NAME="177"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>How laughable? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="178"></A><B>SECOND WOMAN</B>
<A NAME="179"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Our beards look like broiled cuttle-fishes. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="180"></A><B>PRAXAGORA </B>
<A NAME="181"></A><I>pretending to be the herald</I><BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="182"></A>Priest, bring in the cat. Step forward, please Silence, Ariphrades! Come 
<A NAME="183"></A>and take your seat. Now, who wishes to speak? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="184"></A><B>SECOND WOMAN</B>
<A NAME="185"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I do. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="186"></A><B>PRAXAGORA</B>
<A NAME="187"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Then put on this chaplet and success be with you. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="188"></A><B>SECOND WOMAN</B>
<A NAME="189"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>There! </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="190"></A><B>PRAXAGORA</B>
<A NAME="191"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Well then I begin. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="192"></A><B>SECOND WOMAN</B>
<A NAME="193"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Before drinking? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="194"></A><B>PRAXAGORA</B>
<A NAME="195"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Hah! she wants to drink! </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="196"></A><B>SECOND WOMAN</B>
<A NAME="197"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Why, what else is the meaning of this chaplet? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="198"></A><B>PRAXAGORA</B>
<A NAME="199"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Get you hence! you would probably have played us this trick 
<A NAME="200"></A>also before the people. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="201"></A><B>SECOND WOMAN</B>
<A NAME="202"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Well! don't the men drink then in the Assembly? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="203"></A><B>PRAXAGORA</B>
<A NAME="204"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Now she's telling us the men drink! </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="205"></A><B>SECOND WOMAN</B>
<A NAME="206"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Yes, by Artemis, and neat wine too. That's why their decrees 
<A NAME="207"></A>breathe of drunkenness and madness. And why libations, why so many ceremonies, 
<A NAME="208"></A>if wine plays no part in them? Besides, they abuse each other like drunken 
<A NAME="209"></A>men, and you can see the archers dragging more than one uproarious drunkard 
<A NAME="210"></A>out of the market-place. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="211"></A><B>PRAXAGORA</B>
<A NAME="212"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Go back to your seat, you are wandering. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="213"></A><B>SECOND WOMAN </B>
<A NAME="214"></A><I>returning to her seat</I><BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="215"></A>Ah! I should have done better not to have muffled myself in this beard; 
<A NAME="216"></A>my throat's afire and I feel I shall die of thirst. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="217"></A><B>PRAXAGORA</B>
<A NAME="218"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Who else wishes to speak? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="219"></A><B>FIRST WOMAN </B>
<A NAME="220"></A><I>rising</I><BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="221"></A>I do. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="222"></A><B>PRAXAGORA</B>
<A NAME="223"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Quick then, take the chaplet; the time's running short. Try 
<A NAME="224"></A>to speak worthily, let your language be truly manly, and lean on your staff 
<A NAME="225"></A>with dignity. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="226"></A><B>FIRST WOMAN</B>
<A NAME="227"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I had rather have seen one of your regular orators giving you 
<A NAME="228"></A>wise advice; but, as that is not to be, it behoves me to break silence; 
<A NAME="229"></A>I cannot, for my part indeed, allow the tavern-keepers to fill up their 
<A NAME="230"></A>wine-pits with water. No, by the two goddesses... </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="231"></A><B>PRAXAGORA</B>
<A NAME="232"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>What? by the two goddesses! Wretched woman, where are your 
<A NAME="233"></A>senses? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="234"></A><B>FIRST WOMAN</B>
<A NAME="235"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Eh! what?... I have not asked you for a drink. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="236"></A><B>PRAXAGORA</B>
<A NAME="237"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>No, but you want to pass for a man, and you swear by the two 
<A NAME="238"></A>goddesses. Otherwise you did very well. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="239"></A><B>FIRST WOMAN</B>
<A NAME="240"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Well then. By Apollo... </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="241"></A><B>PRAXAGORA</B>
<A NAME="242"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Stop! All these details of language must be adjusted; else 
<A NAME="243"></A>it is quite useless to go to the Assembly. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="244"></A><B>FIRST WOMAN</B>
<A NAME="245"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Give me back the chaplet; I wish to speak again, for I think 
<A NAME="246"></A>I have got hold of something good. You women who are listening to me... 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="247"></A><B>PRAXAGORA</B>
<A NAME="248"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Women again; why, you wretched creature, it's men that you 
<A NAME="249"></A>are addressing. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="250"></A><B>FIRST WOMAN</B>
<A NAME="251"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>That's the fault of Epigonus; I caught sight of him way over 
<A NAME="252"></A>there, and I thought I was speaking to women. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="253"></A><B>PRAXAGORA</B>
<A NAME="254"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Come, withdraw and remain seated in the future. I am going 
<A NAME="255"></A>to take this chaplet myself and speak in your name. May the gods grant 
<A NAME="256"></A>success to my plans! My country is as dear to me as it is to you, and I 
<A NAME="257"></A>groan, I am grieved at all that is happening in it. Scarcely one in ten

<A NAME="261"></A>those who betray you. There was a time when we had no assemblies, and then

<A NAME="306"></A>carry things on their head just as they always did; they keep the Thesmophoria,
