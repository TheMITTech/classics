<A NAME="33"></A>What cares have not gnawed at my heart and how few have been the pleasures 
<A NAME="34"></A>in my life! Four, to be exact, while my troubles have been as countless 
<A NAME="35"></A>as the grains of sand on the shore! Let me see! of what value to me have 
<A NAME="36"></A>been these few pleasures? Ah! I remember that I was delighted in soul when 
<A NAME="37"></A>Cleon had to cough up those five talents; I was in ecstasy and I love the 
<A NAME="38"></A>Knights for this deed; "it is an honour to Greece." But the day when I 
<A NAME="39"></A>was impatiently awaiting a piece by Aeschylus, what tragic despair it caused 
<A NAME="40"></A>me when the herald called, "Theognis, introduce your Chorus!" Just imagine 
<A NAME="41"></A>how this blow struck straight at my heart! On the other hand, what joy 
<A NAME="42"></A>Dexitheus caused me at the musical competition, when right after Moschus 
<A NAME="43"></A>he played a Boeotian melody on the lyre! But this year by contrast! Oh! 
<A NAME="44"></A>what deadly torture to hear Chaeris perform the prelude in the Orthian 
<A NAME="45"></A>mode!-Never, however, since I began to bathe, has the dust hurt my eyes 
<A NAME="46"></A>as it does to-day. Still it is the day of assembly; all should be here 
<A NAME="47"></A>at daybreak, and yet the Pnyx is still deserted. They are gossiping in 
<A NAME="48"></A>the market-place, slipping hither and thither to avoid the vermilioned 
<A NAME="49"></A>rope. The Prytanes even do not come; they will be late, but when they come 
<A NAME="50"></A>they will push and fight each other for a seat in the front row. They will 
<A NAME="51"></A>never trouble themselves with the question of peace. Oh! Athens! Athens! 
<A NAME="52"></A>As for myself, I do not fail to come here before all the rest, and now, 
<A NAME="53"></A>finding myself alone, I groan, yawn, stretch, fart, and know not what to 
<A NAME="54"></A>do; I make sketches in the dust, pull out my loose hairs, muse, think of 
<A NAME="55"></A>my fields, long for peace, curse town life and regret my dear country home, 
<A NAME="56"></A>which never told me to "buy fuel, vinegar or oil"; there the word "buy," 
<A NAME="57"></A>which cuts me in two, was unknown; I harvested everything at will. Therefore 
<A NAME="58"></A>I have come to the assembly fully prepared to bawl, interrupt and abuse 
<A NAME="59"></A>the speakers, if they talk of anything but peace.  </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="60"></A><I>The Orchestra begins to fill with people.</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="61"></A>But here come the Prytanes, and high time too, for it is midday! There,

<A NAME="728"></A>Comedy can sometimes discern what is right. I shall not please, but I shall 
<A NAME="729"></A>say what is true. Besides, Cleon shall not be able to accuse me of attacking 
<A NAME="730"></A>Athens before strangers; we are by ourselves at the festival of the Lenaea; 
<A NAME="731"></A>the time when our allies send us their tribute and their soldiers is not 
<A NAME="732"></A>yet here. There is only the pure wheat without the chaff; as to the resident 
<A NAME="733"></A>aliens settled among us, they and the citizens are one, like the straw 
<A NAME="734"></A>and the ear.
<A NAME="735"></A><BR><BR>I detest the Lacedaemonians with all my heart, and may Posidon, 
<A NAME="736"></A>the god of Taenarus, cause an earthquake and overturn their dwellings! 
<A NAME="737"></A>My vines too have been cut. But come (there are only friends who hear me), 
<A NAME="738"></A>why accuse the Laconians of all our woes? Some men (I do not say the city, 
<A NAME="739"></A>note particularly that I do not say the city), some wretches, lost in vices, 
<A NAME="740"></A>bereft of honour, who were not even citizens of good stamp, but strangers, 
<A NAME="741"></A>have accused the Megarians of introducing their produce fraudulently, and 
<A NAME="742"></A>not a cucumber, a leveret, a suckling pig, a clove of garlic, a lump of 
<A NAME="743"></A>salt was seen without its being said, "Halloa! these come from Megara," 
<A NAME="744"></A>and their being instantly confiscated. Thus far the evil was not serious 
<A NAME="745"></A>and we were the only sufferers. But now some young drunkards go to Megara 
<A NAME="746"></A>and carry off the harlot Simaetha; the Megarians, hurt to the quick, run 
<A NAME="747"></A>off in turn with two harlots of the house of Aspasia; and so for three 
<A NAME="748"></A>whores Greece is set ablaze. Then Pericles, aflame with ire on his Olympian 
<A NAME="749"></A>height, let loose the lightning, caused the thunder to roll, upset Greece 
<A NAME="750"></A>and passed an edict, which ran like the song, "That the Megarians be banished 
<A NAME="751"></A>both from our land and from our markets and from the sea and from the continent." 
<A NAME="752"></A>Meanwhile the Megarians, who were beginning to die of hunger, begged the 
<A NAME="753"></A>Lacedaemonians to bring about the abolition of the decree, of which those 
<A NAME="754"></A>harlots were the cause; several times we refused their demand; and from 
<A NAME="755"></A>that time there was horrible clatter of arms everywhere. You will say that 
<A NAME="756"></A>Sparta was wrong, but what should she have done? Answer that. Suppose that 
<A NAME="757"></A>a Lacedaemonian had seized a little Seriphian dog on any pretext and had 
<A NAME="758"></A>sold it, would you have endured it quietly? Far from it, you would at once 
<A NAME="759"></A>have sent three hundred vessels to sea, and what an uproar there would 
<A NAME="760"></A>have been through all the city I there it's a band of noisy soldiery, here 
<A NAME="761"></A>a brawl about the election of a Trierarch; elsewhere pay is being distributed, 
<A NAME="762"></A>the Pallas figure-heads are being regilded, crowds are surging under the 
<A NAME="763"></A>market porticos, encumbered with wheat that is being measured, wine-skins, 
<A NAME="764"></A>oar-leathers, garlic, olives, onions in nets; everywhere are chaplets, 
<A NAME="765"></A>sprats, flute-girls, black eyes; in the arsenal bolts are being noisily 
<A NAME="766"></A>driven home, sweeps are being made and fitted with leathers; we hear nothing 
<A NAME="767"></A>but the sound of whistles, of flutes and fifes to encourage the workers. 
<A NAME="768"></A>That is what you assuredly would have done, and would not Telephus have 
<A NAME="769"></A>done the same? So I come to my general conclusion; we have no common sense.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="880"></A>Never since our poet presented comedies, has he praised himself upon the 
<A NAME="881"></A>stage; but, having been slandered by his enemies amongst the volatile Athenians, 
<A NAME="882"></A>accused of scoffing at his country and of insulting the people, to-day 
<A NAME="883"></A>he wishes to reply and regain for himself the inconstant Athenians. He 
<A NAME="884"></A>maintains that he has done much that is good for you; if you no longer 
<A NAME="885"></A>allow yourselves to be too much hoodwinked by strangers or seduced by flattery, 
<A NAME="886"></A>if in politics you are no longer the ninnies you once were, it is thanks 
<A NAME="887"></A>to him. Formerly, when delegates from other cities wanted to deceive you, 
<A NAME="888"></A>they had but to style you, "the people crowned with violets," and at the 
<A NAME="889"></A>word "violets" you at once sat erect on the tips of your bums. Or if, to 
<A NAME="890"></A>tickle your vanity, someone spoke of "rich and sleek Athens," in return 
<A NAME="891"></A>for that "sleekness" he would get anything he wanted, because he spoke 
<A NAME="892"></A>of you as he would have of anchovies in oil. In cautioning you against 
<A NAME="893"></A>such wiles, the poet has done you great service as well as in forcing you 
<A NAME="894"></A>to understand what is really the democratic principle. Thus the strangers, 
<A NAME="895"></A>who came to pay their tributes, wanted to see this great poet, who had 
<A NAME="896"></A>dared to speak the truth to Athens. And so far has the fame of his boldness 
<A NAME="897"></A>reached that one day the Great King, when questioning the Lacedaemonian 
<A NAME="898"></A>delegates, first asked them which of the two rival cities was the superior 
<A NAME="899"></A>at sea, and then immediately demanded at which it was that the comic poet 
<A NAME="900"></A>directed his biting satire. "Happy that city," he added, "if it listens 
<A NAME="901"></A>to his counsel; it will grow in power, and its victory is assured." This 
<A NAME="902"></A>is why the Lacedaemonians offer you peace, if you will cede them Aegina; 
<A NAME="903"></A>not that they care for the isle, but they wish to rob you of your poet. 
<A NAME="904"></A>As for you, never lose him, who will always fight for the cause of justice 
<A NAME="905"></A>in his comedies; he promises you that his precepts will lead you to happiness, 
<A NAME="906"></A>though he uses neither flattery, nor bribery, nor intrigue, nor deceit; 
<A NAME="907"></A>instead of loading you with praise, he will point you to the better way. 
<A NAME="908"></A>I scoff at Cleon's tricks and plotting; honesty and justice shall fight 
<A NAME="909"></A>my cause; never will you find me a political poltroon, a prostitute to 
<A NAME="910"></A>the highest bidder. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<A NAME="927"></A>conciliating the younger men, overwhelms us with his ready rhetoric; he 
<A NAME="928"></A>drags us before the judge, presses us with questions, lays traps for us; 
<A NAME="929"></A>the onslaught troubles, upsets and ruins poor old Tithonus, who, crushed 
<A NAME="930"></A>with age, stands tongue-tied; sentenced to a fine, he weeps, he sobs and

<A NAME="943"></A>savage as the Scythian desert he was born in! I wept tears of pity when 
<A NAME="944"></A>I saw a Scythian maltreat this old man, who, by Ceres, when he was young 
<A NAME="945"></A>and the true Thucydides, would not have permitted an insult from Ceres 
<A NAME="946"></A>herself! At that date he would have floored ten orators like Euathlus, 
<A NAME="947"></A>he would have terrified three thousand Scythians with his shouts; he would 
<A NAME="948"></A>have pierced the whole line of the enemy with his shafts. Ah! but if you 
<A NAME="949"></A>will not leave the aged in peace, decree that the advocates be matched; 
<A NAME="950"></A>thus the old man will only be confronted with a toothless greybeard, the 
<A NAME="951"></A>young will fight with the braggart, the ignoble with the son of Clinias; 
<A NAME="952"></A>make law that in the future, the old man can only be summoned and convicted
