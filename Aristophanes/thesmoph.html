<A NAME="22"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Great Zeus! will the swallow never appear to end the winter 
<A NAME="23"></A>of my discontent? Why the fellow has kept me on the run ever since early 
<A NAME="24"></A>this morning; he wants to kill me, that's certain. Before I lose my spleen 
<A NAME="25"></A>antirely, Euripides, can you at least tell me where you are leading me? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="26"></A><B>EURIPIDES</B>
<A NAME="27"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>What need for you to hear what you are going to see? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="28"></A><B>MNESILOCHUS</B>
<A NAME="29"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>How is that? Repeat it. No need for me to hear.... 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="30"></A><B>EURIPIDES</B>
<A NAME="31"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>What you are going to see. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="32"></A><B>MNESILOCHUS</B>
<A NAME="33"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Nor consequently to see.... </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<A NAME="37"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>What is this wiseacre stuff you are telling me? I must neither

<A NAME="39"></A><B>EURIPIDES</B>
<A NAME="40"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Ah! but you have two things there that are essentially distinct. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="41"></A><B>MNESILOCHUS</B>
<A NAME="42"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Seeing and hearing? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="43"></A><B>EURIPIDES</B>
<A NAME="44"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Undoubtedly. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="45"></A><B>MNESILOCHUS</B>
<A NAME="46"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>In what way distinct? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="47"></A><B>EURIPIDES</B>
<A NAME="48"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>In this way. Formerly, when Aether separated the elements and 
<A NAME="49"></A>bore the animals that were moving in her bosom, she wished to endow them 
<A NAME="50"></A>with sight, and so made the eye round like the sun's disc and bored ears 
<A NAME="51"></A>in the form of a funnel. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="52"></A><B>MNESILOCHUS</B>
<A NAME="53"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>And because of this funnel I neither see nor hear. Ah! great 
<A NAME="54"></A>gods! I am delighted to know it. What a fine thing it is to talk with wise 
<A NAME="55"></A>men! </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="56"></A><B>EURIPIDES</B>
<A NAME="57"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I will teach you many another thing of the sort. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="58"></A><B>MNESILOCHUS</B>
<A NAME="59"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>That's well to know; but first of all I should like to find 
<A NAME="60"></A>out how to grow lame, so that I need not have to follow you all about. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="61"></A><B>EURIPIDES</B>
<A NAME="62"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Come, hear and give heed! </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="63"></A><B>MNESILOCHUS</B>

<A NAME="73"></A><B>EURIPIDES</B>
<A NAME="74"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Pay attention! </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<A NAME="77"></A><B>EURIPIDES</B>

<A NAME="93"></A><B>EURIPIDES</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="97"></A>Ah! let us step aside; here is one of his slaves bringing a brazier and

<A NAME="587"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>If I have asked to speak, may the goddesses bear me witness, 
<A NAME="588"></A>it was not for sake of ostentation. But I have long been pained to see 
<A NAME="589"></A>us women insulted by this Euripides, this son of the green-stuff woman, 
<A NAME="590"></A>who loads us with every kind of indignity. Has he not hit us enough, calumniated 
<A NAME="591"></A>us sufficiently, wherever there are spectators, tragedians, and a chorus? 
<A NAME="592"></A>Does; he not style us adulterous, lecherous, bibulous, treacherous, and 
<A NAME="593"></A>garrulous? Does he not repeat that we are all vice, that we are the curse 
<A NAME="594"></A>of our husbands? So that, directly they come back from the theatre, they 
<A NAME="595"></A>look at us doubtfully and go searching every nook, fearing there may be 
<A NAME="596"></A>some hidden lover. We can do nothing as we used to, so many are the false 
<A NAME="597"></A>ideas which he has instilled into our husbands. Is a woman weaving a garland 
<A NAME="598"></A>for herself? It's because she is in love. Does she let some vase drop while 
<A NAME="599"></A>going or returning to the house? her husband asks her in whose honour she 
<A NAME="600"></A>has broken it: "It can only be for that Corinthian stranger." Is a maiden 
<A NAME="601"></A>unwell? Straightway her brother says, "That is a colour that does not please 
<A NAME="602"></A>me." And if a childless woman wishes to substitute one, the deceit can 
<A NAME="603"></A>no longer be a secret, for the neighbours will insist on being present 
<A NAME="604"></A>at her delivery. Formerly the old men married young girls, but they have 
<A NAME="605"></A>been so calumniated that none think of them now, thanks to that line of 
<A NAME="606"></A>his: "A woman is the tyrant of the old man who marries her." Again, it 
<A NAME="607"></A>is because of Euripides that we are incessantly watched, that we are shut 
<A NAME="608"></A>up behind bolts and bars, and that dogs are kept to frighten off the adulterers. 
<A NAME="609"></A>Let that pass; but formerly it was we who had the care of the food, who 
<A NAME="610"></A>fetched the flour from the storeroom, the oil and the wine; we can do it 
<A NAME="611"></A>no more. Our husbands now carry little Spartan keys on their persons, made 
<A NAME="612"></A>with three notches and full of malice and spite. Formerly it sufficed to 
<A NAME="613"></A>purchase a ring marked with the same sign for three obols, to open the 
<A NAME="614"></A>most securely sealed-up door! but now this pestilent Euripides has taught 
<A NAME="615"></A>men to hang seals of worm-eaten wood about their necks. My opinion, therefore, 
<A NAME="616"></A>is that we should rid ourselves of our enemy by poison or by any other 
<A NAME="617"></A>means, provided he dies. That is what I announce publicly; as to certain 
<A NAME="618"></A>points, which I wish to keep secret, I propose to record them on the secretary's

<A NAME="633"></A>the spectators by his tragedies that there were no gods; since then I have 
<A NAME="634"></A>not sold as many chaplets by half. I charge you therefore and exhort you 
<A NAME="635"></A>all to punish him, for does he not deserve it in a thousand respects, he 
<A NAME="636"></A>who loads you with troubles, who is as coarse toward you as the vegetables 
<A NAME="637"></A>upon which his mother reared him? But I must back to the market to weave

<A NAME="646"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Oh, women! I am not astonished at these outbursts of fiery 
<A NAME="647"></A>rage; how could your bile not get inflamed against Euripides, who has spoken 
<A NAME="648"></A>so ill of you? As for myself, I hate the man, I swear it by my children; 
<A NAME="649"></A>it would be madness not to hate him! Yet, let us reflect a little; we are 
<A NAME="650"></A>alone and our words will not be repeated outside. Why be so bent on his 
<A NAME="651"></A>ruin? Because he has known and shown up two or three of our faults, when 
<A NAME="652"></A>we have a thousand? As for myself, not to speak of other women, I have 
<A NAME="653"></A>more than one great sin upon my conscience, but this is the blackest of 
<A NAME="654"></A>them. I had been married three days and my husband was asleep by my side; 
<A NAME="655"></A>I had a lover, who had seduced me when I was seven years old; impelled 
<A NAME="656"></A>by his passion, he came scratching at the door; I understood at once he 
<A NAME="657"></A>was there and was going down noiselessly. "Where are you going?" asked 
<A NAME="658"></A>my husband. "I am suffering terribly with colic," I told him, "and am going 
<A NAME="659"></A>to the can." "Go ahead," he replied, and started pounding together juniper 
<A NAME="660"></A>berries, aniseed, and sage. As for myself, I moistened the door-hinge and 
<A NAME="661"></A>went to find my lover, who laid me, half-reclining upon Apollo's altar 
<A NAME="662"></A>and holding on to the sacred laurel with one hand. Well now! Consider! 
<A NAME="663"></A>that is a thing of which Euripides has never spoken. And when we bestow 
<A NAME="664"></A>our favours on slaves and muleteers for want of better, does he mention 
<A NAME="665"></A>this? And when we eat garlic early in the morning after a night of wantonness, 
<A NAME="666"></A>so that our husband, who has been keeping guard upon the city wall, may 
<A NAME="667"></A>be reassured by the smell and suspect nothing, has Euripides ever breathed 
<A NAME="668"></A>a word of this? Tell me. Neither has he spoken of the woman who spreads 
<A NAME="669"></A>open a large cloak before her husband's eyes to make him admire it in full 
<A NAME="670"></A>daylight to conceal her lover by so doing and afford him the means of making 
<A NAME="671"></A>his escape. I know another, who for ten whole days pretended to be suffering 
<A NAME="672"></A>the pains of labour until she had secured a child; the husband hurried 
<A NAME="673"></A>in all directions to buy drugs to hasten her deliverance, and meanwhile 
<A NAME="674"></A>an old woman brought the infant in a stew-pot; to prevent its crying she 
<A NAME="675"></A>had stopped up its mouth with honey. With a sign she told the wife that 
<A NAME="676"></A>she was bringing a child for her, who at once began exclaiming, "Go away, 
<A NAME="677"></A>friend, go away, I think I am going to be delivered; I can feel him kicking 
<A NAME="678"></A>his heels in the belly ....of the stew-pot." The husband goes off full 
<A NAME="679"></A>of joy, and the old wretch quickly takes the honey out of the child's mouth, 
<A NAME="680"></A>which starts crying; then she seizes the baby, runs to the father and tells 
<A NAME="681"></A>him with a smile on her face, "It's a lion, a lion, that is born to you; 
<A NAME="682"></A>it's your very image. Everything about it is like you, even his little 
<A NAME="683"></A>tool, curved like the sky." Are these not our everyday tricks? Why certainly, 
<A NAME="684"></A>by Artemis, and we, are angry with Euripides, who assuredly treats us no 
<A NAME="685"></A>worse than we deserve! </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<A NAME="1089"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Let us address ourselves to the spectators to sing our praises, 
<A NAME="1090"></A>despite the fact that each one says much ill of women. If the men are to 
<A NAME="1091"></A>be believed, we are a plague to them; through us come all their troubles, 
<A NAME="1092"></A>quarrels, disputes, sedition, griefs and wars. But if we are truly such 
<A NAME="1093"></A>a pest, why marry us? Why forbid us to go out or show ourselves at the 
<A NAME="1094"></A>window? You want to keep this pest, and take a thousand cares to do it. 
<A NAME="1095"></A>If your wife goes out and you meet her away from the house, you fly into 
<A NAME="1096"></A>a fury. Ought you not rather to rejoice and give thanks to the gods? for 
<A NAME="1097"></A>if the pest has disappeared, you will no longer find it at home. If we 
<A NAME="1098"></A>fall asleep at friends' houses from the fatigue of playing and sporting, 
<A NAME="1099"></A>each of you comes prowling round the bed to contemplate the features of 
<A NAME="1100"></A>this pest. If we seat ourselves at the window, each one wants to see the 
<A NAME="1101"></A>pest, and if we withdraw through modesty, each wants all the more to see 
<A NAME="1102"></A>the pest perch herself there again. It is thus clear that we are better 
<A NAME="1103"></A>than you, and the proof of this is easy. Let us find out which is the worse 
<A NAME="1104"></A>of the two sexes. We say, "It's you," while you aver, "it's we."' Come, 
<A NAME="1105"></A>let us compare them in detail, each individual man with a woman. Charminus 
<A NAME="1106"></A>is not equal to Nausimache, that's certain. Cleophon is in every respect 
<A NAME="1107"></A>inferior to Salabaccho. It's a long time now since any of you has dared 
<A NAME="1108"></A>to contest the prize with Aristomache, the heroine of Marathon, or with 
<A NAME="1109"></A>Stratonice.
<A NAME="1110"></A><BR><BR>Among the last year's Senators, who have just yielded their office 
<A NAME="1111"></A>to other citizens, is there one who equals Eubule? Not even Anytus would 
<A NAME="1112"></A>say that. Therefore we maintain that men are greatly our inferiors. You 
<A NAME="1113"></A>see no woman who has robbed the state of fifty talents rushing about the 
<A NAME="1114"></A>city in a magnificent chariot; our greatest peculations are a measure of 
<A NAME="1115"></A>corn, which we steal from our husbands, and even then we return it to them 
<A NAME="1116"></A>the very same day. But we could name many amongst you who do quite as much, 
<A NAME="1117"></A>and who are, even more than ourselves, gluttons, parasites, cheats and 
<A NAME="1118"></A>kidnappers of slaves. We know how to keep our property better than you. 
<A NAME="1119"></A>We still have our cylinders, our beams, our baskets and our surshades; 
<A NAME="1120"></A>whereas many among you have lost the wood of your spears as well as the

<A NAME="1123"></A><BR><BR>There are many reproaches we have the right to bring against men. 
<A NAME="1124"></A>The most serious is this, that the woman, who has given birth to a useful

<A NAME="1126"></A>a place of honour should be reserved for her at the Stenia, the Scirophoria, 
<A NAME="1127"></A>and the other festivals that we keep. On the other hand, she of whom a 
<A NAME="1128"></A>coward was born or a worthless man, a bad trierarch or an unskilful pilot, 
<A NAME="1129"></A>should sit with shaven head, behind her sister who had borne a brave man. 
<A NAME="1130"></A>Oh! citizens! is it just that the mother of Hyperbolus should sit dressed 
<A NAME="1131"></A>in white and with loosened tresses beside that of Lamachus and lend out 
<A NAME="1132"></A>money on usury? He, who may have made a deal of this nature with her, so
