<A NAME="37"></A>Do you think I should walk straight for yon tree? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="38"></A><B>PITHETAERUS </B>
<A NAME="39"></A><I>to his crow</I><BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="40"></A>Cursed beast, what are you croaking to me?...to retrace my steps? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="41"></A><B>EUELPIDES</B>
<A NAME="42"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Why, you wretch, we are wandering at random, we are exerting 
<A NAME="43"></A>ourselves only to return to the same spot; we're wasting our time. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="44"></A><B>PITHETAERUS</B>
<A NAME="45"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>To think that I should trust to this crow, which has made me 
<A NAME="46"></A>cover more than a thousand furlongs! </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="47"></A><B>EUELPIDES</B>
<A NAME="48"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>And that I, in obedience to this jay, should have worn my toes 
<A NAME="49"></A>down to the nails! </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="50"></A><B>PITHETAERUS</B>
<A NAME="51"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>If only I knew where we were.... </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="52"></A><B>EUELPIDES</B>
<A NAME="53"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Could you find your country again from here? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="54"></A><B>PITHETAERUS</B>
<A NAME="55"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>No, I feel quite sure I could not, any more than could Execestides 
<A NAME="56"></A>find his. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="57"></A><B>EUELPIDES</B>
<A NAME="58"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Alas! </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="59"></A><B>PITHETAERUS</B>
<A NAME="60"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Aye, aye, my friend, it's surely the road of "alases" we are 
<A NAME="61"></A>following. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="62"></A><B>EUELPIDES</B>
<A NAME="63"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>That Philocrates, the bird-seller, played us a scurvy trick, 
<A NAME="64"></A>when he pretended these two guides could help us to find Tereus, the Epops, 
<A NAME="65"></A>who is a bird, without being born of one. He has indeed sold us this jay, 
<A NAME="66"></A>a true son of Tharrhelides, for an obolus, and this crow for three, but 
<A NAME="67"></A>what can they do? Why, nothing whatever but bite and scratch! 
<A NAME="68"></A> </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="69"></A><I>To his jay</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="70"></A>What's the matter with you then, that you keep opening your beak? Do you 
<A NAME="71"></A>want us to fling ourselves headlong down these rocks? There is no road 
<A NAME="72"></A>that way. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="73"></A><B>PITHETAERUS</B>
<A NAME="74"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Not even the vestige of a trail in any direction 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="75"></A><B>EUELPIDES</B>
<A NAME="76"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>And what does the crow say about the road to follow? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="77"></A><B>PITHETAERUS</B>
<A NAME="78"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>By Zeus, it no longer croaks the same thing it did. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="79"></A><B>EUELPIDES</B>
<A NAME="80"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>And which way does it tell us to go now? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="81"></A><B>PITHETAERUS</B>
<A NAME="82"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>It says that, by dint of gnawing, it will devour my fingers. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="83"></A><B>EUELPIDES</B>
<A NAME="84"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>What misfortune is ours! we strain every nerve to get to the 
<A NAME="85"></A>crows, do everything we can to that end, and we cannot find our way! Yes, 
<A NAME="86"></A>spectators, our madness is quite different from that of Sacas. He is not 
<A NAME="87"></A>a citizen, and would fain be one at any cost; we, on the contrary, born 
<A NAME="88"></A>of an honourable tribe and family and living in the midst of our fellow-citizens, 
<A NAME="89"></A>we have fled from our country as hard as ever we could go. It's not that 
<A NAME="90"></A>we hate it; we recognize it to be great and rich, likewise that everyone 
<A NAME="91"></A>has the right to ruin himself paying taxes; but the crickets only chirrup 
<A NAME="92"></A>among the fig-trees for a month or two, whereas the Athenians spend their 
<A NAME="93"></A>whole lives in chanting forth judgments from their law-courts. That is 
<A NAME="94"></A>why we started off with a basket, a stew-pot and some myrtle boughs! and 
<A NAME="95"></A>have come to seek a quiet country in which to settle. We are going to Tereus, 
<A NAME="96"></A>the Epops, to learn from him, whether, in his aerial flights, he has noticed 
<A NAME="97"></A>some town of this kind. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="98"></A><B>PITHETAERUS</B>
<A NAME="99"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Here! look! </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="100"></A><B>EUELPIDES</B>
<A NAME="101"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>What's the matter? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="102"></A><B>PITHETAERUS</B>
<A NAME="103"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Why, the crow has been directing me to something up there for 
<A NAME="104"></A>some time now. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="105"></A><B>EUELPIDES</B>
<A NAME="106"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>And the jay is also opening it beak and craning its neck to 
<A NAME="107"></A>show me I know not what. Clearly, there are some birds about here. We shall 
<A NAME="108"></A>soon know, if we kick up a noise to start them. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="109"></A><B>PITHETAERUS</B>
<A NAME="110"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Do you know what to do? Knock your leg against this rock. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="111"></A><B>EUELPIDES</B>
<A NAME="112"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>And you your head to double the noise. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="113"></A><B>PITHETAERUS</B>
<A NAME="114"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Well then use a stone instead; take one and hammer with it. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="115"></A><B>EUELPIDES</B>
<A NAME="116"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Good idea!  </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="117"></A><I>He does so.</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="118"></A>Ho there, within! Slave! slave! </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="119"></A><B>PITHETAERUS</B>
<A NAME="120"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>What's that, friend! You say, "slave," to summon Epops? It 
<A NAME="121"></A>would be much better to shout, "Epops, Epops! </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="122"></A><B>EUELPIDES</B>
<A NAME="123"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Well then, Epops! Must I knock again? Epops! 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="124"></A><B>TROCHILUS </B>
<A NAME="125"></A><I>rushing out of a thicket</I><BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="126"></A>Who's there? Who calls my master? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="127"></A><B>PITHETAERUS </B>
<A NAME="128"></A><I>in terror</I><BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="129"></A>Apollo the Deliverer! what an enormous beak! </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="130"></A><I>He defecates. In the confusion both the jay and the crow fly 
<A NAME="131"></A>away.</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="132"></A><B>TROCHILUS </B>
<A NAME="133"></A><I>equally frightened</I><BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="134"></A>Good god! they are bird-catchers. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="135"></A><B>EUELPIDES </B>
<A NAME="136"></A><I>reassuring himself</I><BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="137"></A>But is it so terrible? Wouldn't it be better to explain things? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="138"></A><B>TROCHILUS </B>
<A NAME="139"></A><I>also reassuring himself</I><BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="140"></A>You're done for. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="141"></A><B>EUELPIDES</B>
<A NAME="142"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>But we are not men. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="143"></A><B>TROCHILUS</B>
<A NAME="144"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>What are you, then? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="145"></A><B>EUELPIDES </B>
<A NAME="146"></A><I>defecating also</I><BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="147"></A>I am the Fearling, an African bird. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="148"></A><B>TROCHILUS</B>
<A NAME="149"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>You talk nonsense. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="150"></A><B>EUELPIDES</B>
<A NAME="151"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Well, then, just ask it of my feet. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="152"></A><B>TROCHILUS</B>
<A NAME="153"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>And this other one, what bird is it?  </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="154"></A><I>To PITHETAERUS</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="155"></A>Speak up </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="156"></A><B>PITHETAERUS </B>
<A NAME="157"></A><I>weakly</I><BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="158"></A>I? I am a Crapple, from the land of the pheasants. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="159"></A><B>EUELPIDES</B>
<A NAME="160"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>But you yourself, in the name of the gods! what animal are 
<A NAME="161"></A>you? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="162"></A><B>TROCHILUS</B>
<A NAME="163"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Why, I am a slave-bird. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="164"></A><B>EUELPIDES</B>
<A NAME="165"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Why, have you been conquered by a cock? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="166"></A><B>TROCHILUS</B>
<A NAME="167"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>No, but when my master was turned into a hoopoe, he begged 
<A NAME="168"></A>me to become a bird also, to follow and to serve him. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="169"></A><B>EUELPIDES</B>
<A NAME="170"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Does a bird need a servant, then? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="171"></A><B>TROCHILUS</B>
<A NAME="172"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>That's no doubt because he was once a man. At times he wants 
<A NAME="173"></A>to eat a dish of sardines from Phalerum; I seize my dish and fly to fetch 
<A NAME="174"></A>him some. Again he wants some pea-soup; I seize a ladle and a pot and run 
<A NAME="175"></A>to get it. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="176"></A><B>EUELPIDES</B>
<A NAME="177"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>This is, then, truly a running-bird. Come, Trochilus, do us 
<A NAME="178"></A>the kindness to call your master. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="179"></A><B>TROCHILUS</B>
<A NAME="180"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Why, he has just fallen asleep after a feed of myrtle-berries 
<A NAME="181"></A>and a few grubs. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="182"></A><B>EUELPIDES</B>
<A NAME="183"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Never mind; wake him up. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="184"></A><B>TROCHILUS</B>
<A NAME="185"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I an; certain he will be angry. However, I will wake him to 
<A NAME="186"></A>please you. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="187"></A><I>He goes back into the thicket.</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="188"></A><B>PITHETAERUS </B>
<A NAME="189"></A><I>as soon as TROCHILUS is out of sight</I><BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="190"></A>You cursed brute! why, I am almost dead with terror! 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="191"></A><B>EUELPIDES</B>
<A NAME="192"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Oh! my god! it was sheer fear that made me lose my jay. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="193"></A><B>PITHETAERUS</B>
<A NAME="194"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Ah! you big coward! were you so frightened that you let go 
<A NAME="195"></A>your jay? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="196"></A><B>EUELPIDES</B>
<A NAME="197"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>And did you not lose your crow, when you fell sprawling on

<A NAME="199"></A><B>PITHETAERUS</B>
<A NAME="200"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Not at all. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="201"></A><B>EUELPIDES</B>
<A NAME="202"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Where is it, then? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="203"></A><B>PITHETAERUS</B>
<A NAME="204"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>It flew away. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="205"></A><B>EUELPIDES</B>
<A NAME="206"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>And you did not let it go? Oh! you brave fellow! 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="207"></A><B>EPOPS </B>
<A NAME="208"></A><I>from within</I><BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="209"></A>Open the thicket, that I may go out! </BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="224"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>At what, then? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="225"></A><B>EUELPIDES</B>
<A NAME="226"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Why, it's your beak that looks so ridiculous to us. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="227"></A><B>EPOPS</B>
<A NAME="228"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>This is how Sophocles outrages me in his tragedies. Know, I

<A NAME="240"></A><B>EPOPS</B>
<A NAME="241"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>No. All birds moult their feathers, you know, every winter,

<A NAME="251"></A><B>EUELPIDES</B>

<A NAME="262"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>What for? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="263"></A><B>EUELPIDES</B>
<A NAME="264"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Because you formerly were a man, like we are, formerly you 
<A NAME="265"></A>had debts, as we have, formerly you did not want to pay them, like ourselves;

<A NAME="1105"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Weak mortals, chained to the earth, creatures of clay as frail 
<A NAME="1106"></A>as the foliage of the woods, you unfortunate race, whose life is but darkness, 
<A NAME="1107"></A>as unreal as a shadow, the illusion of a dream, hearken to us, who are 
<A NAME="1108"></A>immortal beings, ethereal, ever young and occupied with eternal thoughts, 
<A NAME="1109"></A>for we shall teach you about all celestial matters; you shall know thoroughly 
<A NAME="1110"></A>what is the nature of the birds, what the origin of the gods, of the rivers, 
<A NAME="1111"></A>of Erebus, and Chaos; thanks to us, even Prodicus will envy you your 
<A NAME="1112"></A>knowledge.
<A NAME="1113"></A><BR><BR>At the beginning there was only Chaos, Night, dark Erebus, and 
<A NAME="1114"></A>deep Tartarus. Earth, the air and heaven had no existence. Firstly, black-winged 
<A NAME="1115"></A>Night laid a germless egg in the bosom of the infinite deeps of Erebus, 
<A NAME="1116"></A>and from this, after the revolution of long ages, sprang the graceful Eros 
<A NAME="1117"></A>with his glittering golden wings, swift as the whirlwinds of the tempest. 
<A NAME="1118"></A>He mated in deep Tartarus with dark Chaos, winged like himself, and thus 
<A NAME="1119"></A>hatched forth our race, which was the first to see the light. That of the 
<A NAME="1120"></A>Immortals did not exist until Eros had brought together all the ingredients 
<A NAME="1121"></A>of the world, and from their marriage Heaven, Ocean, Earth and the imperishable 
<A NAME="1122"></A>race of blessed gods sprang into being. Thus our origin is very much older 
<A NAME="1123"></A>than that of the dwellers in Olympus. We are the offspring of Eros; there 
<A NAME="1124"></A>are a thousand proofs to show it. We have wings and we lend assistance 
<A NAME="1125"></A>to lovers. How many handsome youths, who had sworn to remain insensible, 
<A NAME="1126"></A>have opened their thighs because of our power and have yielded themselves 
<A NAME="1127"></A>to their lovers when almost at the end of their youth, being led away by 
<A NAME="1128"></A>the gift of a quail, a waterfowl, a goose, or a cock.
<A NAME="1129"></A><BR><BR>And what important services do not the birds render to mortals! 
<A NAME="1130"></A>First of all, they mark the seasons for them, springtime, winter, and autumn. 
<A NAME="1131"></A>Does the screaming crane migrate to Libya,-it warns the husbandman to sow, 
<A NAME="1132"></A>the pilot to take his ease beside his tiller hung up in his dwelling, and 
<A NAME="1133"></A>Orestes to weave a tunic, so that the rigorous cold may not drive him any 
<A NAME="1134"></A>more to strip other folk. When the kite reappears, he tells of the return 
<A NAME="1135"></A>of spring and of the period when the fleece of the sheep must be clipped. 
<A NAME="1136"></A>Is the swallow in sight? All hasten to sell their warm tunic and to buy 
<A NAME="1137"></A>some light clothing. We are your Ammon, Delphi, Dodona, your Phoebus Apollo. 
<A NAME="1138"></A>Before undertaking anything, whether a business transaction, a marriage, 
<A NAME="1139"></A>or the purchase of food, you consult the birds by reading the omens, and 
<A NAME="1140"></A>you give this name of omen to all signs that tell of the future. With you 
<A NAME="1141"></A>a word is an omen, you call a sneeze an omen, a meeting an omen, an unknown

<A NAME="1172"></A>find relations. Does the son of Pisias want to betray the gates of the

<A NAME="1185"></A>wings. To begin with, just let us suppose a spectator to be dying with 
<A NAME="1186"></A>hunger and to be weary of the choruses of the tragic poets; if he were 
<A NAME="1187"></A>winged, he would fly off, go home to dine and come back with his stomach 
<A NAME="1188"></A>filled. Some Patroclides, needing to take a crap, would not have to spill 
<A NAME="1189"></A>it out on his cloak, but could fly off, satisfy his requirements, let a 
<A NAME="1190"></A>few farts and, having recovered his breath, return. If one of you, it matters 
<A NAME="1191"></A>not who, had adulterous relations and saw the husband of his mistress in 
<A NAME="1192"></A>the seats of the senators, he might stretch his wings, fly to her, and, 
<A NAME="1193"></A>having laid her, resume his place. Is it not the most priceless gift of 
<A NAME="1194"></A>all, to be winged? Look at Diitrephes! His wings were only wicker-work 
<A NAME="1195"></A>ones, and yet he got himself chosen Phylarch and then Hipparch; from being
