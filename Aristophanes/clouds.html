<A NAME="24"></A>Great gods! will these nights never end? will daylight never come? I heard

<A NAME="27"></A>Now I may not even chastise my own slaves. Again there's this brave lad,

<A NAME="33"></A>debts, which are devouring me, thanks to this fine cavalier, who only knows 
<A NAME="34"></A>how to look after his long locks, to show himself off in his chariot and 
<A NAME="35"></A>to dream of horses! And I, I am nearly dead, when I see the moon bringing 
<A NAME="36"></A>the third decade in her train and my liability falling due....Slave! light

<A NAME="41"></A>did I borrow these? Ah! I know! It was to buy that thoroughbred, which

<A NAME="74"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Very well, sleep on! but remember that all these debts will 
<A NAME="75"></A>fall back on your shoulders. Oh! curses on the go-between who made me marry 
<A NAME="76"></A>your mother! I lived so happily in the country, a commonplace, everyday 
<A NAME="77"></A>life, but a good and easy one-had not a trouble, not a care, was rich in 
<A NAME="78"></A>bees, in sheep and in olives. Then indeed I had to marry the niece of Megacles, 
<A NAME="79"></A>the son of Megacles; I belonged to the country, she was from the town; 
<A NAME="80"></A>she was a haughty, extravagant woman, a true Coesyra. On the nuptial day, 
<A NAME="81"></A>when I lay beside her, I was reeking of the dregs of the wine-cup, of cheese 
<A NAME="82"></A>and of wool; she was redolent with essences, saffron, voluptuous kisses, 
<A NAME="83"></A>the love of spending, of good cheer and of wanton delights. I will not 
<A NAME="84"></A>say she did nothing; no, she worked hard...to ruin me, and pretending all 
<A NAME="85"></A>the while merely to be showing her the cloak she had woven for me, I said, 
<A NAME="86"></A>"Wife you go too fast about your work, your threads are too closely woven 
<A NAME="87"></A>and you use far too much wool." </BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="92"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Why then did you light such a thirsty lamp? Come here, I am

<A NAME="94"></A><B>SLAVE</B>
<A NAME="95"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>What for? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="96"></A><B>STREPSIADES</B>
<A NAME="97"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Because you have put in too thick a wick....Later, when we 
<A NAME="98"></A>had this boy, what was to be his name? It was the cause of much quarrelling 
<A NAME="99"></A>with my loving wife. She insisted on having some reference to a horse in 
<A NAME="100"></A>his name, that he should be called Xanthippus, Charippus or Callippides. 
<A NAME="101"></A>I wanted to name him Phidonides after his grandfather. We disputed long, 
<A NAME="102"></A>and finally agreed to style him Phidippides....She used to fondle and coax 
<A NAME="103"></A>him, saying, "Oh! what a joy it will be to me when you have grown up, to 
<A NAME="104"></A>see you, like my father, Megacles, clothed in purple and standing up straight 
<A NAME="105"></A>in your chariot driving your steeds toward the town." And I would say to 
<A NAME="106"></A>him, "When, like your father, you will go, dressed in a skin, to fetch 
<A NAME="107"></A>back your goats from Phelleus." Alas! he never listened to me and his madness 
<A NAME="108"></A>for horses has shattered my fortune.  </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="109"></A><I>He gets out of bed.</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="110"></A>But by dint of thinking the livelong night, I have discovered a road to 
<A NAME="111"></A>salvation, both miraculous and divine. If he will but follow it, I shall 
<A NAME="112"></A>be out of my trouble! First, however, he must be awakened, but it must 
<A NAME="113"></A>be done as gently as possible. How shall I manage it? Phidippides! my little 
<A NAME="114"></A>Phidippides! </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<A NAME="126"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>By Posidon, the equestrian Posidon! yes, I swear I do. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="127"></A><B>STREPSIADES</B>
<A NAME="128"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Oh, do not, I pray you, invoke this god of horses; he is the 
<A NAME="129"></A>one who is the cause of all my cares. But if you really love me, and with 
<A NAME="130"></A>your whole heart, my boy, believe me. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<A NAME="133"></A><B>STREPSIADES</B>

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="135"></A><B>PHIDIPPIDES</B>
<A NAME="136"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Say on, what are your orders? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="137"></A><B>STREPSIADES</B>
<A NAME="138"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Will you obey me ever so little? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="139"></A><B>PHIDIPPIDES</B>
<A NAME="140"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>By Bacchus, I will obey you. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="141"></A><B>STREPSIADES</B>
<A NAME="142"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Very well then! Look this way. Do you see that little door 
<A NAME="143"></A>and that little house? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="144"></A><B>PHIDIPPIDES</B>
<A NAME="145"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Yes, father. But what are you driving at? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="146"></A><B>STREPSIADES</B>
<A NAME="147"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>That is the Thoughtery of wise souls. There they prove that 
<A NAME="148"></A>we are coals enclosed on all sides under a vast snuffer, which is the sky. 
<A NAME="149"></A>If well paid, these men also teach one how to gain law-suits, whether they 
<A NAME="150"></A>be just or not. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="151"></A><B>PHIDIPPIDES</B>
<A NAME="152"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>What do they call themselves? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="153"></A><B>STREPSIADES</B>
<A NAME="154"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I do not know exactly, but they are deep thinkers and most 
<A NAME="155"></A>admirable people. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="156"></A><B>PHIDIPPIDES</B>
<A NAME="157"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Bah! the wretches! I know them; you mean those quacks with 
<A NAME="158"></A>pale faces, those barefoot fellows, such as that miserable Socrates and 
<A NAME="159"></A>Chaerephon? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="160"></A><B>STREPSIADES</B>
<A NAME="161"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Silence! say nothing foolish! If you desire your father not 
<A NAME="162"></A>to die of hunger, join their company and let your horses go. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="163"></A><B>PHIDIPPIDES</B>
<A NAME="164"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>No, by Bacchus! even though you gave me the pheasants that 
<A NAME="165"></A>Leogoras raises. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="166"></A><B>STREPSIADES</B>
<A NAME="167"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Oh! my beloved son, I beseech you, go and follow their teachings. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="168"></A><B>PHIDIPPIDES</B>
<A NAME="169"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>And what is it I should learn? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="170"></A><B>STREPSIADES</B>
<A NAME="171"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>It seems they have two courses of reasoning, the true and the 
<A NAME="172"></A>false, and that, thanks to the false, the worst law-suits can be gained. 
<A NAME="173"></A>If then you learn this science, which is false, I shall not have to pay 
<A NAME="174"></A>an obolus of all the debts I have contracted on your account. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="175"></A><B>PHIDIPPIDES</B>
<A NAME="176"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>No, I will not do it. I should no longer dare to look at our 
<A NAME="177"></A>gallant horsemen, when I had so ruined my tan. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="178"></A><B>STREPSIADES</B>
<A NAME="179"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Well then, by Demeter! I will no longer support you, neither 
<A NAME="180"></A>you, nor your team, nor your saddle-horse. Go and hang yourself, I turn 
<A NAME="181"></A>you out of house and home. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="182"></A><B>PHIDIPPIDES</B>
<A NAME="183"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>My uncle Megacles will not leave me without horses; I shall

<A NAME="189"></A><I>He hesitates.</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="190"></A>But at my age, memory has gone and the mind is slow to grasp things. How

<A NAME="211"></A><B>DISCIPLE</B>
<A NAME="212"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Very well then, but reflect, that these are mysteries. Lately, 
<A NAME="213"></A>a flea bit Chaerephon on the brow and then from there sprang on to the 
<A NAME="214"></A>head of Socrates. Socrates asked Chaerephon, "How many times the length 
<A NAME="215"></A>of its legs does a flea jump?" </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="216"></A><B>STREPSIADES</B>
<A NAME="217"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>And how ever did he go about measuring it? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="218"></A><B>DISCIPLE</B>
<A NAME="219"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Oh! it was most ingenious! He melted some wax, seized the flea 
<A NAME="220"></A>and dipped its two feet in the wax, which, when cooled, left them shod 
<A NAME="221"></A>with true Persian slippers. These he took off and with them measured the 
<A NAME="222"></A>distance. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="223"></A><B>STREPSIADES</B>
<A NAME="224"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Ah! great Zeus! what a brain! what subtlety! 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="225"></A><B>DISCIPLE</B>
<A NAME="226"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I wonder what then would you say, if you knew another of Socrates'

<A NAME="228"></A><B>STREPSIADES</B>
<A NAME="229"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>What is it? Pray tell me. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="230"></A><B>DISCIPLE</B>
<A NAME="231"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Chaerephon of the deme of Sphettia asked him whether he thought 
<A NAME="232"></A>a gnat buzzed through its proboscis or through its anus. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="233"></A><B>STREPSIADES</B>
<A NAME="234"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>And what did he say about the gnat? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="235"></A><B>DISCIPLE</B>
<A NAME="236"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>He said that the gut of the gnat was narrow, and that, in passing 
<A NAME="237"></A>through this tiny passage, the air is driven with force towards the breech; 
<A NAME="238"></A>then after this slender channel, it encountered the rump, which was distended 
<A NAME="239"></A>like a trumpet, and there it resounded sonorously. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="240"></A><B>STREPSIADES</B>
<A NAME="241"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>So the arse of a gnat is a trumpet. Oh! what a splendid arsevation! 
<A NAME="242"></A>Thrice happy Socrates! It would not be difficult to succeed in a law-suit,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="798"></A>Spectators! By Bacchus, whose servant I am, I will frankly tell you the 
<A NAME="799"></A>truth. May I secure both victory and renown as certainly as I hold you 
<A NAME="800"></A>for adept critics and as I regard this comedy as my best. I wished to give 
<A NAME="801"></A>you the first view of a work, which had cost me much trouble, but which 
<A NAME="802"></A>I withdrew, unjustly beaten by unskilful rivals. It is you, oh, enlightened 
<A NAME="803"></A>public, for whom I have prepared my piece, that I reproach with this. Nevertheless 
<A NAME="804"></A>I shall never willingly cease to seek the approval of the discerning. I 
<A NAME="805"></A>have not forgotten the day, when men, whom one is happy to have for an 
<A NAME="806"></A>audience, received my Virtuous Young Man and my Paederast with so much 
<A NAME="807"></A>favour in this very place. Then as yet virgin, my Muse had not attained 
<A NAME="808"></A>the age for maternity; she had to expose her first-born for another to 
<A NAME="809"></A>adopt, and it has since grown up under your generous patronage. Ever since 
<A NAME="810"></A>you have as good as sworn me your faithful alliance. Thus, like the Electra 
<A NAME="811"></A>of the poets, my comedy has come to seek you to-day, hoping again to encounter 
<A NAME="812"></A>such enlightened spectators. As far away as she can discern her Orestes, 
<A NAME="813"></A>she will be able to recognize him by his curly head. And note her modest 
<A NAME="814"></A>demeanour! She has not sewn on a piece of hanging leather, thick and reddened 
<A NAME="815"></A>at the end, to cause laughter among the children; she does not rail at 
<A NAME="816"></A>the bald, neither does she dance the cordax; no old man is seen, who, while 
<A NAME="817"></A>uttering his lines, batters his questioner with a stick to make his poor 
<A NAME="818"></A>jests pass muster. She does not rush upon the scene carrying a torch and 
<A NAME="819"></A>screaming, 'Iou! Iou!' No, she relies upon herself and her verses....My 
<A NAME="820"></A>value is so well known, that I take no further pride in it. I do not seek 
<A NAME="821"></A>to deceive you, by reproducing the same subjects two or three times; I 
<A NAME="822"></A>always invent fresh themes to present before you, themes that have no relation 
<A NAME="823"></A>to each other and that are all clever. I attacked Cleon to his face and 
<A NAME="824"></A>when he was all-powerful; but he has fallen, and now I have no desire to 
<A NAME="825"></A>kick him when he is down. My rivals, on the contrary, now that this wretched 
<A NAME="826"></A>Hyperbolus has given them the cue, have never ceased setting upon both 
<A NAME="827"></A>him and his mother. First Eupolis presented his 'Maricas'; this was simply 
<A NAME="828"></A>my 'Knights,' whom this plagiarist had clumsily furbished up again by adding 
<A NAME="829"></A>to the piece an old drunken woman, so that she might dance the cordax. 
<A NAME="830"></A>It was an old idea, taken from Phrynichus, who caused his old hag to be 
<A NAME="831"></A>devoured by a monster of the deep. Then Hermippus fell foul of Hyperbolus 
<A NAME="832"></A>and now all the others fall upon him and repeat my comparison of the eels. 
<A NAME="833"></A>May those who find amusement in their pieces not be pleased with mine, 
<A NAME="834"></A>but as for you, who love and applaud my inventions, why, posterity will 
<A NAME="835"></A>praise your good taste. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<A NAME="873"></A>her very shamefully, her, who does not pay you in words alone, but who 
<A NAME="874"></A>renders you all real benefits. Firstly, thanks to her, you save at least 
<A NAME="875"></A>a drachma each month for lights, for each, as he is leaving home at night, 
<A NAME="876"></A>says, "Slave, buy no torches, for the moonlight is beautiful,"-not to name 
<A NAME="877"></A>a thousand other benefits. Nevertheless you do not reckon the days correctly 
<A NAME="878"></A>and your calendar is naught but confusion. Consequently the gods load her 
<A NAME="879"></A>with threats each time they get home and are disappointed of their meal, 
<A NAME="880"></A>because the festival has not been kept in the regular order of time. When 
<A NAME="881"></A>you should be sacrificing, you are putting to the torture or administering 
<A NAME="882"></A>justice. And often, we others, the gods, are fasting in token of mourning 
<A NAME="883"></A>for the death of Memnon or Sarpedon, while you are devoting yourselves 
<A NAME="884"></A>to joyous libations. It is for this, that last year, when the lot would

<A NAME="1466"></A>seen approaching a lover and themselves rousing his passion by soft
<A NAME="1467"></A>modulation of the voice and lustful gaze. At table, they would not
<A NAME="1468"></A>have dared, before those older than themselves, to have taken a radish,

<A NAME="2059"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Was not the legislator who carried this law a man like
<A NAME="2060"></A>you and me? In those days be got men to believe him; then why should
<A NAME="2061"></A>not I too have the right to establish for the future a new law, allowing
<A NAME="2062"></A>children to beat their fathers in turn? We make you a present of all
<A NAME="2063"></A>the blows which were received before his law, and admit that you thrashed
<A NAME="2064"></A>us with impunity. But look how the cocks and other animals fight with
<A NAME="2065"></A>their fathers; and yet what difference is there betwixt them and ourselves,
<A NAME="2066"></A>unless it be that they do not propose decrees? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="2067"></A><B>STREPSIADES </B>
<A NAME="2068"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>But if you imitate the cocks in all things, why don't
<A NAME="2069"></A>you scratch up the dunghill, why don't you sleep on a perch?</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="2070"></A><B>PHIDIPPIDES </B>
<A NAME="2071"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>That has no bearing on the case, good sir; Socrates would
<A NAME="2072"></A>find no connection, I assure you. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="2073"></A><B>STREPSIADES </B>
<A NAME="2074"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Then do not beat at all, for otherwise you have only
<A NAME="2075"></A>yourself to blame afterwards. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="2076"></A><B>PHIDIPPIDES </B>
<A NAME="2077"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>What for? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="2078"></A><B>STREPSIADES  </B>
<A NAME="2079"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I have the right to chastise you, and you to chastise
<A NAME="2080"></A>your son, if you have one. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="2081"></A><B>PHIDIPPIDES </B>
<A NAME="2082"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>And if I have not, I shall have cried in vain, and you
<A NAME="2083"></A>will die laughing in my face. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="2084"></A><B>STREPSIADES </B>
<A NAME="2085"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>What say you, all here present? It seems to me that he
<A NAME="2086"></A>is right, and I am of opinion that they should be accorded their right.
<A NAME="2087"></A>If we think wrongly, it is but just we should be beaten.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="2088"></A><B>PHIDIPPIDES </B>
<A NAME="2089"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Again, consider this other point. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="2090"></A><B>STREPSIADES </B>
<A NAME="2091"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>It will be the death of me. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="2092"></A><B>PHIDIPPIDES </B>
<A NAME="2093"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>But you will certainly feel no more anger because of
<A NAME="2094"></A>the blows I have given you. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="2095"></A><B>STREPSIADES </B>
<A NAME="2096"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Come, show me what profit I shall gain from it.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="2097"></A><B>PHIDIPPIDES  </B>
<A NAME="2098"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I shall beat my mother just as I have you. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="2099"></A><B>STREPSIADES </B>
<A NAME="2100"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>What do you say? what's that you say? Hah! this is far
<A NAME="2101"></A>worse still. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="2102"></A><B>PHIDIPPIDES </B>
<A NAME="2103"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>And what if I prove to you by our school reasoning, that
<A NAME="2104"></A>one ought to beat one's mother? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="2105"></A><B>STREPSIADES </B>
<A NAME="2106"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Ah! if you do that, then you will only have to throw
<A NAME="2107"></A>yourself, along with Socrates and his reasoning, into the Barathrum.
<A NAME="2108"></A>Oh! Clouds! all our troubles emanate from you, from you, to whom I
<A NAME="2109"></A>entrusted myself, body and soul. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="2110"></A><B>LEADER OF THE CHORUS </B>
<A NAME="2111"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>No, you alone are the cause, because you have
<A NAME="2112"></A>pursued the path of evil. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="2113"></A><B>STREPSIADES </B>
<A NAME="2114"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Why did you not say so then, instead of egging on a poor
<A NAME="2115"></A>ignorant old man? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="2116"></A><B>LEADER OF THE CHORUS </B>
<A NAME="2117"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>We always act thus, when we see a man conceive
<A NAME="2118"></A>a passion for what is evil; we strike him with some terrible disgrace,
<A NAME="2119"></A>so that he may learn to fear the gods. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="2120"></A><B>STREPSIADES </B>
<A NAME="2121"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Alas! oh Clouds! that's hard indeed, but it's just! I
<A NAME="2122"></A>ought not to have cheated my creditors....But come, my dear son, come
<A NAME="2123"></A>with me to take vengeance on this wretched Chaerephon and on Socrates,
<A NAME="2124"></A>who have deceived us both. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="2125"></A><B>PHIDIPPIDES </B>
<A NAME="2126"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I shall do nothing against our masters. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="2127"></A><B>STREPSIADES </B>
<A NAME="2128"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Oh show some reverence for ancestral Zeus! </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="2129"></A><B>PHIDIPPIDES </B>
<A NAME="2130"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Mark him and his ancestral Zeus! What a fool you are!
<A NAME="2131"></A>Does any such being as Zeus exist? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="2132"></A><B>STREPSIADES </B>
<A NAME="2133"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Why, assuredly. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="2134"></A><B>PHIDIPPIDES </B>
<A NAME="2135"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>No, a thousand times no! The ruler of the world is the
<A NAME="2136"></A>Whirlwind, that has unseated Zeus. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="2137"></A><B>STREPSIADES </B>
<A NAME="2138"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>He has not dethroned him. I believed it, because of this
<A NAME="2139"></A>whirligig here. Unhappy wretch that I am! I have taken a piece of
<A NAME="2140"></A>clay to be a god. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="2141"></A><B>PHIDIPPIDES </B>
<A NAME="2142"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Very well! Keep your stupid nonsense for your own consumption.
<A NAME="2143"></A>(He goes back into STREPSIADES' house.)  </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="2144"></A><B>STREPSIADES </B>
<A NAME="2145"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Oh! what madness! I had lost my reason when I threw over
<A NAME="2146"></A>the gods through Socrates' seductive phrases.  (Addressing the statue
<A NAME="2147"></A>of Hermes)  Oh! good Hermes, do not destroy me in your wrath. Forgive
<A NAME="2148"></A>me; their babbling had driven me crazy. Be my counselor. Shall I pursue
<A NAME="2149"></A>them at law or shall I....? Order and I obey.-You are right, no law-suit;
<A NAME="2150"></A>but up! let us burn down the home of those praters. Here, Xanthias,
<A NAME="2151"></A>here! take a ladder, come forth and arm yourself with an axe; now
<A NAME="2152"></A>mount upon the Thoughtery, demolish the roof, if you love your master,
<A NAME="2153"></A>and may the house fall in upon them. Ho! bring me a blazing torch!
<A NAME="2154"></A>There is more than one of them, arch-impostors as they are, on whom
<A NAME="2155"></A>I am determined to have vengeance. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="2156"></A><B>A DISCIPLE  </B>
<A NAME="2157"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>(from within) Oh! oh! </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="2158"></A><B>STREPSIADES </B>
<A NAME="2159"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Come, torch, do your duty! Burst into full flame!</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="2160"></A><B>DISCIPLE </B>
<A NAME="2161"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>What are you up to? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="2162"></A><B>STREPSIADES </B>
<A NAME="2163"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>What am I up to? Why, I am entering upon a subtle argument
<A NAME="2164"></A>with the beams of the house. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="2165"></A><B>SECOND DISCIPLE  </B>
<A NAME="2166"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>(from within) Hullo! hullo who is burning down our
<A NAME="2167"></A>house? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="2168"></A><B>STREPSIADES </B>
<A NAME="2169"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>The man whose cloak you have appropriated. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="2170"></A><B>SECOND DISCIPLE </B>
<A NAME="2171"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>You are killing us! </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="2172"></A><B>STREPSIADES </B>
<A NAME="2173"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>That is just exactly what I hope, unless my axe plays
<A NAME="2174"></A>me false, or I fall and break my neck. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="2175"></A><B>SOCRATES  </B>
<A NAME="2176"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>(appearing at the window) Hi! you fellow on the roof, what
<A NAME="2177"></A>are you doing up there? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="2178"></A><B>STREPSIADES  </B>
<A NAME="2179"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>(mocking SOCRATES' manner) I am traversing the air and
<A NAME="2180"></A>contemplating the sun. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="2181"></A><B>SOCRATES </B>
<A NAME="2182"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Ah! ah! woe is upon me! I am suffocating! </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="2183"></A><B>SECOND DISCIPLE </B>
<A NAME="2184"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>And I, alas, shall be burnt up! </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="2185"></A><B>STREPSIADES </B>
<A NAME="2186"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Ah! you insulted the gods! You studied the face of the
<A NAME="2187"></A>moon! Chase them, strike and beat them down! Forward! they have richly
<A NAME="2188"></A>deserved their fate-above all, by reason of their blasphemies.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="2189"></A><B>LEADER OF THE CHORUS </B>
<A NAME="2190"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>So let the Chorus file off the stage. Its part
is played. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
