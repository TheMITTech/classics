<A NAME="19"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Oh! alas! alas! alas! Oh! woe! oh! woe! Miserable Paphlagonian! 
<A NAME="20"></A>may the gods destroy both him and his cursed advice! Since that evil day 
<A NAME="21"></A>when this new slave entered the house he has never ceased belabouring us 
<A NAME="22"></A>with blows. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="23"></A><B>NICIAS</B>
<A NAME="24"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>May the plague seize him, the arch-fiend-him and his lying

<A NAME="26"></A><B>DEMOSTHENES</B>
<A NAME="27"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Hah! my poor fellow, what is your condition? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="28"></A><B>NICIAS</B>
<A NAME="29"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Very wretched, just like your own. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="30"></A><B>DEMOSTHENES</B>
<A NAME="31"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Then come, let us sing a duet of groans in the style of Olympus. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="32"></A><B>DEMOSTHENES AND NICIAS</B>
<A NAME="33"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Boo, hoo! boo, hoo! boo, hoo! boo, hoo! boo, hoo! boo, hoo!! 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="34"></A><B>DEMOSTHENES</B>
<A NAME="35"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Bah! it's lost labour to weep! Enough of groaning! Let us consider 
<A NAME="36"></A>now to save our pelts. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="37"></A><B>NICIAS</B>
<A NAME="38"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>But how to do it! Can you suggest anything? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="39"></A><B>DEMOSTHENES</B>
<A NAME="40"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>No, you begin. I cede you the honour. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="41"></A><B>NICIAS</B>
<A NAME="42"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>By Apollo! no, not I. Come, have courage! Speak, and then I 
<A NAME="43"></A>will say what I think. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="44"></A><B>DEMOSTHENES </B>
<A NAME="45"></A><I>in tragic style</I><BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="46"></A>"Ah! would you but tell me what I should tell you! </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="47"></A><B>NICIAS</B>
<A NAME="48"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I dare not. How could I express my thoughts with the pomp of 
<A NAME="49"></A>Euripides? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="50"></A><B>DEMOSTHENES</B>
<A NAME="51"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Oh! please spare me! Do not pelt me with those vegetables, 
<A NAME="52"></A>but find some way of leaving our master. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="53"></A><B>NICIAS</B>
<A NAME="54"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Well, then! Say "Let-us-bolt," like this, in one breath. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="55"></A><B>DEMOSTHENES</B>
<A NAME="56"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I follow you-'Let-us-bolt." </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="57"></A><B>NICIAS</B>
<A NAME="58"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Now after "Let-us-bolt" say "at-top-speed 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="59"></A><B>DEMOSTHENES</B>
<A NAME="60"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>"At-top-speed! </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="61"></A><B>NICIAS</B>
<A NAME="62"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Splendid! just as if you were masturbating; first slowly, "Let-us-bolt"; 
<A NAME="63"></A>then quick and firmly, "at-top-speed!" </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="64"></A><B>DEMOSTHENES</B>
<A NAME="65"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Let-us-bolt, let-us-bolt-at-top-speed! </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="66"></A><B>NICIAS</B>
<A NAME="67"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Hah! does that not please you? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="68"></A><B>DEMOSTHENES</B>
<A NAME="69"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Yes, indeed, yet I fear your omen bodes no good to my hide. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="70"></A><B>NICIAS</B>
<A NAME="71"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>How so? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="72"></A><B>DEMOSTHENES</B>
<A NAME="73"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Because masturbation chafes the skin. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="74"></A><B>NICIAS</B>
<A NAME="75"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>The best thing we can do for the moment is to throw ourselves 
<A NAME="76"></A>at the feet of the statue of some god. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="77"></A><B>DEMOSTHENES</B>
<A NAME="78"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Of which statue? Any statue? Do you then believe there are 
<A NAME="79"></A>gods? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="80"></A><B>NICIAS</B>
<A NAME="81"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Certainly. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="82"></A><B>DEMOSTHENES</B>
<A NAME="83"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>What proof have you? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="84"></A><B>NICIAS</B>
<A NAME="85"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>The proof that they have taken a grudge against me. Is that 
<A NAME="86"></A>not enough? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="87"></A><B>DEMOSTHENES</B>
<A NAME="88"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I'm convinced it is. But to pass on. Do you consent to my telling 
<A NAME="89"></A>the spectators of our troubles? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="90"></A><B>NICIAS</B>
<A NAME="91"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>There's nothing wrong with that, and we might ask them to show 
<A NAME="92"></A>us by their manner, whether our facts and actions are to their liking. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="93"></A><B>DEMOSTHENES</B>
<A NAME="94"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I will begin then. We have a very brutal master, a perfect 
<A NAME="95"></A>glutton for beans, and most bad-tempered; it's Demos of the Pnyx, an intolerable 
<A NAME="96"></A>old man and half deaf. The beginning of last month he bought a slave, a 
<A NAME="97"></A>Paphlagonian tanner, an arrant rogue, the incarnation of calumny. This 
<A NAME="98"></A>man of leather knows his old master thoroughly; he plays the fawning cur, 
<A NAME="99"></A>flatters, cajoles, wheedles, and dupes him at will with little scraps of 
<A NAME="100"></A>leavings, which he allows him to get. "Dear Demos," he will say, "try a 
<A NAME="101"></A>single case and you will have done enough; then take your bath, eat, swallow 
<A NAME="102"></A>and devour; here are three obols." Then the Paphlagonian filches from one 
<A NAME="103"></A>of us what we have prepared and makes a present of it to our old man. The 
<A NAME="104"></A>other day I had just kneaded a Spartan cake at Pylos, the cunning rogue 
<A NAME="105"></A>came behind my back, sneaked it and offered the cake, which was my invention, 
<A NAME="106"></A>in his own name. He keeps us at a distance and suffers none but himself 
<A NAME="107"></A>to wait upon the master; when Demos is dining, he keeps close to his side 
<A NAME="108"></A>with a thong in his hand and puts the orators to flight. He keeps singing 
<A NAME="109"></A>oracles to him, so that the old man now thinks of nothing but the Sibyl. 
<A NAME="110"></A>Then, when he sees him thoroughly obfuscated, he uses all his cunning and 
<A NAME="111"></A>piles up lies and calumnies against the household; then we are scourged 
<A NAME="112"></A>and the Paphlagonian runs about among the slaves to demand contributions 
<A NAME="113"></A>with threats and gathers them in with both hands. He will say, "You see 
<A NAME="114"></A>how I have had Hylas beaten! Either content me or die at once!" We are 
<A NAME="115"></A>forced to give, for otherwise the old man tramples on us and makes us crap 
<A NAME="116"></A>forth all our body contains.  </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="117"></A><I>To NICIAS</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="118"></A>There must be an end to it, friend Let us see! what can be done? Who will 
<A NAME="119"></A>get us out of this mess? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="120"></A><B>NICIAS</B>
<A NAME="121"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>The best thing, friend, is our famous "Let-us-bolt!" 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="122"></A><B>DEMOSTHENES</B>
<A NAME="123"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>But none can escape the Paphlagonian, his eye is everywhere. 
<A NAME="124"></A>And what a stride! He has one leg on Pylos and the other in the Assembly; 
<A NAME="125"></A>his arse gapes exactly over the land of the Chaonians, his hands are with 
<A NAME="126"></A>the Aetolians and his mind with the Clopidians. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="127"></A><B>NICIAS</B>
<A NAME="128"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>It's best then to die; but let us seek the most heroic death. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="129"></A><B>DEMOSTHENES</B>
<A NAME="130"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Let me think, what is the most heroic? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="131"></A><B>NICIAS</B>
<A NAME="132"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Let us drink the blood of a bull; that's the death Themistocles 
<A NAME="133"></A>chose. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="134"></A><B>DEMOSTHENES</B>
<A NAME="135"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>No, not that, but a bumper of good unmixed wine in honour of 
<A NAME="136"></A>the Good Genius; perchance we may stumble on a happy thought. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="137"></A><B>NICIAS</B>
<A NAME="138"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Look at him! "Unmixed wine!" Your mind is on drink intent? 
<A NAME="139"></A>Can a man strike out a brilliant thought when drunk? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="140"></A><B>DEMOSTHENES</B>
<A NAME="141"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Without question. Go, ninny, blow yourself out with water; 
<A NAME="142"></A>do you dare to accuse wine of clouding the reason? Quote me more marvellous 
<A NAME="143"></A>effects than those of wine. Look! when a man drinks, he is rich, everything 
<A NAME="144"></A>he touches succeeds, he gains lawsuits, is happy and helps his friends. 
<A NAME="145"></A>Come, bring hither quick a flagon of wine, that I may soak my brain and 
<A NAME="146"></A>get an ingenious idea. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="147"></A><B>NICIAS</B>
<A NAME="148"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>My God! What can your drinking do to help us? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="149"></A><B>DEMOSTHENES</B>
<A NAME="150"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Much. But bring it to me, while I take my seat. Once drunk, 
<A NAME="151"></A>I shall strew little ideas, little phrases, little reasonings everywhere. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="152"></A><I>NICIAS enters the house and returns almost immediately with a 
<A NAME="153"></A>bottle.</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="154"></A><B>NICIAS</B>
<A NAME="155"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>It is lucky I was not caught in the house stealing the wine. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="156"></A><B>DEMOSTHENES</B>
<A NAME="157"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Tell me, what is the Paphlagonian doing now? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="158"></A><B>NICIAS</B>
<A NAME="159"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>The wretch has just gobbled up some confiscated cakes; he is 
<A NAME="160"></A>drunk and lies at full-length snoring on his hides. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="161"></A><B>DEMOSTHENES</B>
<A NAME="162"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Very well, come along, pour me out wine and plenty of it. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="163"></A><B>NICIAS</B>
<A NAME="164"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Take it and offer a libation to your Good Genius. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<A NAME="170"></A>Ah! Good Genius, thine the plan, not mine! </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="171"></A><B>NICIAS</B>
<A NAME="172"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Tell me, what is it? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="173"></A><B>DEMOSTHENES</B>
<A NAME="174"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Run indoors quick and steal the oracles of the Paphlagonian, 
<A NAME="175"></A>while he is asleep. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="176"></A><B>NICIAS</B>
<A NAME="177"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Bless me! I fear this Good Genius will be but a very Bad Genius 
<A NAME="178"></A>for me. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="179"></A><I>He goes into the house.</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="180"></A><B>DEMOSTHENES</B>
<A NAME="181"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>And I'll set the flagon near me, that I may moisten my wit 
<A NAME="182"></A>to invent some brilliant notion. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="183"></A><I>NICIAS enters the house and returns at once.</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="184"></A><B>NICIAS</B>
<A NAME="185"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>How loudly the Paphlagonian farts and snores! I was able to 
<A NAME="186"></A>seize the sacred oracle, which he was guarding with the greatest care, 
<A NAME="187"></A>without his seeing me. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="188"></A><B>DEMOSTHENES</B>
<A NAME="189"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Oh! clever fellow! Hand it here, that I may read. Come, pour 
<A NAME="190"></A>me out some drink, bestir yourself! Let me see what there is in it. Oh! 
<A NAME="191"></A>prophecy! Some drink! some drink! Quick! </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="192"></A><B>NICIAS</B>
<A NAME="193"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Well! what says the oracle? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="194"></A><B>DEMOSTHENES</B>
<A NAME="195"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Pour again. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="196"></A><B>NICIAS</B>
<A NAME="197"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Is "Pour again" in the oracle? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="198"></A><B>DEMOSTHENES</B>
<A NAME="199"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Oh, Bacis! </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="200"></A><B>NICIAS</B>
<A NAME="201"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>But what is in it? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="202"></A><B>DEMOSTHENES</B>

<A NAME="206"></A><B>DEMOSTHENES</B>
<A NAME="207"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Oh! miserable Paphlagonian! This then is why you have so long 
<A NAME="208"></A>taken such precautions; your horoscope gave you qualms of terror. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="209"></A><B>NICIAS</B>
<A NAME="210"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>What does it say? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="211"></A><B>DEMOSTHENES</B>
<A NAME="212"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>It says here how he must end. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="213"></A><B>NICIAS</B>
<A NAME="214"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>And how? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="215"></A><B>DEMOSTHENES</B>
<A NAME="216"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>How? the oracle announces clearly that a dealer in oakum must 
<A NAME="217"></A>first govern the city. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="218"></A><B>NICIAS</B>
<A NAME="219"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>That's one tradesman. And after him, who? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="220"></A><B>DEMOSTHENES</B>
<A NAME="221"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>After him, a sheep-dealer. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="224"></A><B>DEMOSTHENES</B>
<A NAME="225"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>To reign until a filthier scoundrel than he arises; then he

<A NAME="227"></A>robber, the bawler, who roars like a torrent. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="762"></A>Had one of the old authors asked me to mount this stage to recite his verses, 
<A NAME="763"></A>he would not have found it hard to persuade me. But our poet of to-day 
<A NAME="764"></A>is likewise worthy of this favour; he shares our hatred, he dares to tell 
<A NAME="765"></A>the truth, he boldly braves both waterspouts and hurricanes. Many among 
<A NAME="766"></A>you, he tells us, have expressed wonder, that he has not long since had 
<A NAME="767"></A>a piece presented in his own name, and have asked the reason why. This 
<A NAME="768"></A>is what he bids us say in reply to your questions; it is not without grounds 
<A NAME="769"></A>that he has courted the shade, for, in his opinion, nothing is more difficult 
<A NAME="770"></A>than to cultivate the comic Muse; many court her, but very few secure her 
<A NAME="771"></A>favours. Moreover, he knows that you are fickle by nature and betray your 
<A NAME="772"></A>poets when they grow old. What fate befell Magnes, when his hair went white? 
<A NAME="773"></A>Often enough had he triumphed over his rivals; he had sung in all keys, 
<A NAME="774"></A>played the lyre and fluttered wings; he turned into a Lydian and even into 
<A NAME="775"></A>a gnat, daubed himself with green to become a frog. All in vain! When young, 
<A NAME="776"></A>you applauded him; in his old age you hooted and mocked him, because his 
<A NAME="777"></A>genius for raillery had gone. Cratinus again was like a torrent of glory 
<A NAME="778"></A>rushing across the plain, up-rooting oak, plane tree and rivals and bearing 
<A NAME="779"></A>them pell-mell in his wake. The only songs at the banquet were, "Doro, 
<A NAME="780"></A>shod with lying tales" and "Adepts of the Lyric Muse," so great was his 
<A NAME="781"></A>renown. Look at him now! he drivels, his lyre has neither strings nor keys, 
<A NAME="782"></A>his voice quivers, but you have no pity for him, and you let him wander 
<A NAME="783"></A>about as he can, like Connas, his temples circled with a withered chaplet; 
<A NAME="784"></A>the poor old fellow is dying of thirst; he who, in honour of his glorious 
<A NAME="785"></A>past, should be in the Prytaneum drinking at his ease, and instead of trudging 
<A NAME="786"></A>the country should be sitting amongst the first row of the spectators, 
<A NAME="787"></A>close to the statue of Dionysus and loaded with perfumes. Crates, again, 
<A NAME="788"></A>have you done hounding him with your rage and your hisses? True, it was 
<A NAME="789"></A>but meagre fare that his sterile Muse could offer you; a few ingenious 
<A NAME="790"></A>fancies formed the sole ingredients, but nevertheless he knew how to stand 
<A NAME="791"></A>firm and to recover from his falls. It is such examples that frighten our 
<A NAME="792"></A>poet; in addition, he would tell himself, that before being a pilot, he 
<A NAME="793"></A>must first know how to row, then to keep watch at the prow, after that 
<A NAME="794"></A>how to gauge the winds, and that only then would he be able to command 
<A NAME="795"></A>his vessel. If then you approve this wise caution and his resolve that 
<A NAME="796"></A>he would not bore you with foolish nonsense, raise loud waves of applause 
<A NAME="797"></A>in his favour this day, so that, at this Lenaean feast, the breath of your 
<A NAME="798"></A>favour may swell the sails of his triumphant galley and the poet may withdraw 
<A NAME="799"></A>proud of his success, with head erect and his face beaming with delight.

<A NAME="817"></A>dust, deny his mishap and begin the struggle anew. Not one of these generals 
<A NAME="818"></A>of old time would have asked Cleaenetus to be fed at the cost of the State; 
<A NAME="819"></A>but our present men refuse to fight, unless they get the honours of the 
<A NAME="820"></A>Prytaneum and precedence in their seats. As for us, we place our valour

<A NAME="859"></A><B>SAUSAGE-SELLER</B>
<A NAME="860"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>The story is worth hearing. Listen! From here I rushed straight 
<A NAME="861"></A>to the Senate, right in the track of this man; he was already letting loose 
<A NAME="862"></A>the storm, unchaining the lightning, crushing the Knights beneath huge 
<A NAME="863"></A>mountains of calumnies heaped together and having all the air of truth; 
<A NAME="864"></A>he called you conspirators and his lies caught root like weeds in every 
<A NAME="865"></A>mind; dark were the looks on every side and brows were knitted. When I 
<A NAME="866"></A>saw that the Senate listened to him favourably and was being tricked by 
<A NAME="867"></A>his imposture I said to myself, "Come, gods of rascals and braggarts, gods 
<A NAME="868"></A>of all fools, and toad-eaters, and thou too, oh market-place, wherein I 
<A NAME="869"></A>was bred from my earliest days, give me unbridled audacity, an untiring 
<A NAME="870"></A>chatter and a shameless voice." No sooner had I ended this prayer than 
<A NAME="871"></A>a pederast farted on my right. "Hah! a good omen," said I, and prostrated 
<A NAME="872"></A>myself; then I burst open the door by a vigorous push with my arse, and, 
<A NAME="873"></A>opening my mouth to the utmost, shouted, "Senators, I wanted you to be 
<A NAME="874"></A>the first to hear the good news; since the war broke out, I have never 
<A NAME="875"></A>seen anchovies at a lower price!" All faces brightened at once and I was 
<A NAME="876"></A>voted a chaplet for my good tidings; and I added, "With a couple of words 
<A NAME="877"></A>I will reveal to you how you can have quantities of anchovies for an obol; 
<A NAME="878"></A>all you have to do is to seize on all the dishes the merchants have." With 
<A NAME="879"></A>mouths gaping with admiration, they applauded me. However, the Paphlagonian 
<A NAME="880"></A>winded the matter and, well knowing the sort of language which pleases 
<A NAME="881"></A>the Senate best, said, "Friends, I am resolved to offer one hundred oxen 
<A NAME="882"></A>to the goddess in recognition of this happy event." The Senate at once 
<A NAME="883"></A>veered to his side. So when I saw myself defeated by this ox dung, I outbade 
<A NAME="884"></A>the fellow, crying, "Two hundred!" And beyond this I moved that a vow be 
<A NAME="885"></A>made to Diana of a thousand goats if the next day anchovies should only 
<A NAME="886"></A>be worth an obol a hundred. And the Senate looked towards me again. The 
<A NAME="887"></A>other, stunned with the blow, grew delirious in his speech, and at last 
<A NAME="888"></A>the Prytanes and the Scythians dragged him out. The Senators then stood 
<A NAME="889"></A>talking noisily about the anchovies. Cleon, however, begged them to listen 
<A NAME="890"></A>to the Lacedaemonian envoy, who had come to make proposals of peace; but 
<A NAME="891"></A>all with one accord cried "Certainly it's not the moment to think of peace 
<A NAME="892"></A>now! If anchovies are so cheap, what need have we of peace? Let the war 
<A NAME="893"></A>take its course!" And with loud shouts they demanded that the Prytanes 
<A NAME="894"></A>should close the sitting and then they leapt over the rails in all directions. 
<A NAME="895"></A>As for me, I slipped away to buy all the coriander seed and leeks there 
<A NAME="896"></A>were on the market and gave it to them gratis as seasoning for their anchovies. 
<A NAME="897"></A>It was marvellous! They loaded me with praises and caresses; thus I conquered 
<A NAME="898"></A>the Senate with an obol's worth of leeks, and here I am.
