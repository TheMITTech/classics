<A NAME="26"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Quick, quick, bring the dung-beetle his cake. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="27"></A><B>SECOND SERVANT</B>
<A NAME="28"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>There it is. Give it to him, and may it kill him! And may he 
<A NAME="29"></A>never eat a better. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="30"></A><B>FIRST SERVANT</B>
<A NAME="31"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Now give him this other one kneaded up with ass's dung. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="32"></A><B>SECOND SERVANT</B>
<A NAME="33"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>There! I've done that too. And where's what you gave him just 
<A NAME="34"></A>now? Surely he can't have devoured it yet! </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="35"></A><B>FIRST SERVANT</B>
<A NAME="36"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Indeed he has; he snatched it, rolled it between his feet and 
<A NAME="37"></A>bolted it. Come, hurry up, knead up a lot and knead them stiffly. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="38"></A><B>SECOND SERVANT</B>
<A NAME="39"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Oh, scavengers, help me in the name of the gods, if you do 
<A NAME="40"></A>not wish to see me fall down choked. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="41"></A><B>FIRST SERVANT</B>
<A NAME="42"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Come, come, another made from the stool of a fairy's favourite. 
<A NAME="43"></A>That will be to the beetle's taste; he likes it well ground. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="44"></A><B>SECOND SERVANT</B>
<A NAME="45"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>There! I am free at least from suspicion; none will accuse 
<A NAME="46"></A>me of tasting what I mix. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="47"></A><B>FIRST SERVANT</B>
<A NAME="48"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Faugh! come, now another! keep on mixing with all your might. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="49"></A><B>SECOND SERVANT</B>
<A NAME="50"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>By god, no. I can stand this awful cesspool stench no longer. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="51"></A><B>FIRST SERVANT</B>
<A NAME="52"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I shall bring you the whole ill-smelling gear. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="53"></A><B>SECOND SERVANT</B>
<A NAME="54"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Pitch it down the sewer sooner, and yourself with it. 
<A NAME="55"></A> </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="56"></A><I>To the AUDIENCE</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="57"></A>Maybe, one of you can tell me where I can buy a stopped-up nose, for there 
<A NAME="58"></A>is no work more disgusting than to mix food for a dung-beetle and to carry 
<A NAME="59"></A>it to him. A pig or a dog will at least pounce upon our excrement without 
<A NAME="60"></A>more ado, but this foul wretch affects the disdainful, the spoilt mistress, 
<A NAME="61"></A>and won't eat unless I offer him a cake that has been kneaded for an entire 
<A NAME="62"></A>day.... But let us open the door a bit ajar without his seeing it. Has 
<A NAME="63"></A>he done eating? Come, pluck up courage, cram yourself till you burst! The 
<A NAME="64"></A>cursed creature! It wallows in its food! It grips it between its claws 
<A NAME="65"></A>like a wrestler clutching his opponent, and with head and feet together 
<A NAME="66"></A>rolls up its paste like a rope-maker twisting a hawser. What an indecent, 
<A NAME="67"></A>stinking, gluttonous beast! I don't know what angry god let this monster 
<A NAME="68"></A>loose upon us, but of a certainty it was neither Aphrodite nor the Graces. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="69"></A><B>FIRST SERVANT</B>
<A NAME="70"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Who was it then? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="71"></A><B>SECOND SERVANT</B>
<A NAME="72"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>No doubt Zeus, the God of the Thundercrap. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="73"></A><B>FIRST SERVANT</B>
<A NAME="74"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>But perhaps some spectator, some beardless youth, who thinks 
<A NAME="75"></A>himself a sage, will say, "What is this? What does the beetle mean?" And 
<A NAME="76"></A>then an Ionian, sitting next him, will add, "I think it's an allusion to 
<A NAME="77"></A>Cleon, who so shamelessly feeds on filth all by himself."-But now I'm going 
<A NAME="78"></A>indoors to fetch the beetle a drink. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="79"></A><B>SECOND SERVANT</B>
<A NAME="80"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>As for me, I will explain the matter to you all, children, 
<A NAME="81"></A>youths, grownups and old men, aye, even to the decrepit dotards. My master 
<A NAME="82"></A>is mad, not as you are, but with another sort of madness, quite a new kind. 
<A NAME="83"></A>The livelong day he looks open-mouthed towards heaven and never stops addressing 
<A NAME="84"></A>Zeus. "Ah! Zeus," he cries, "what are thy intentions? Lay aside thy besom; 
<A NAME="85"></A>do not sweep Greece away!" Ah! Hush, hush! I think I hear his voice! 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="86"></A><B>TRYGAEUS </B>
<A NAME="87"></A><I>from within</I><BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="88"></A>Oh! Zeus, what art thou going to do for our people? Dost thou not see this, 
<A NAME="89"></A>that our cities will soon be but empty husks? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="90"></A><B>SECOND SERVANT</B>
<A NAME="91"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>As I told you, that is his form of madness. There you have 
<A NAME="92"></A>a sample of his follies. When his trouble first began to seize him, he 
<A NAME="93"></A>said to himself, "By what means could I go straight to Zeus? Then he made 
<A NAME="94"></A>himself very slender little ladders and so clambered up towards heaven; 
<A NAME="95"></A>but he soon came hurtling down again and broke his head. Yesterday, to 
<A NAME="96"></A>our misfortune, he went out and brought us back this thoroughbred, but 
<A NAME="97"></A>from where I know not, this great beetle, whose groom he has forced me 
<A NAME="98"></A>to become. He himself caresses it as though it were a horse, saying, "Oh! 
<A NAME="99"></A>my little Pegasus, my noble aerial steed, may your wings soon bear me straight 
<A NAME="100"></A>to Zeus!" But what is my master doing? I must stoop down to look through 
<A NAME="101"></A>this hole. Oh! great gods! Here! neighbours, run here quick! here is my 
<A NAME="102"></A>master flying off mounted on his beetle as if on horseback.

<A NAME="107"></A>Gently, gently, go easy, beetle; don't start off so proudly, or trust at 
<A NAME="108"></A>first too greatly to your powers; wait till you have sweated, till the 
<A NAME="109"></A>beating of your wings shall make your limb joints supple. Above all things, 
<A NAME="110"></A>don't let off some foul smell. I adjure you; else I would rather have you

<A NAME="217"></A>from the earth, stretch out your speedy wings and make straight for the 
<A NAME="218"></A>palace of Zeus; for once give up foraging in your daily food.-Hi! you down 
<A NAME="219"></A>there, what are you after now? Oh! my god! it's a man taking a crap in 
<A NAME="220"></A>the Piraeus, close to the whorehouses. But is it my death you seek then, 
<A NAME="221"></A>my death? Will you not bury that right away and pile a great heap of earth 
<A NAME="222"></A>upon it and plant wild thyme therein and pour perfumes on it? If I were

<A NAME="302"></A>and the Laconians came with peace proposals, you would say, "By Demeter,

<A NAME="894"></A>well knew that the poor were driven to extremity and lacked even bread; 
<A NAME="895"></A>but they nevertheless drove away the Goddess, each time she reappeared 
<A NAME="896"></A>in answer to the wish of the country, with their loud shrieks that were 
<A NAME="897"></A>as sharp as pitchforks; furthermore, they attacked the well-filled purses 
<A NAME="898"></A>of the richest among our allies on the pretence that they belonged to Brasidas'

<A NAME="900"></A>teeth; for the city, all pale with hunger and cowed with terror, gladly 
<A NAME="901"></A>snapped up any calumny that was thrown it to devour. So the strangers, 
<A NAME="902"></A>seeing what terrible blows the informers dealt, sealed their lips with

<A NAME="1034"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Farewell and good luck be yours! Let us begin by handing over 
<A NAME="1035"></A>all this gear to the care of our servants, for no place is less safe than 
<A NAME="1036"></A>a theatre; there is always a crowd of thieves prowling around it, seeking 
<A NAME="1037"></A>to find some mischief to do. Come, keep a good watch over all this. As 
<A NAME="1038"></A>for ourselves, let us explain to the spectators what we have in our minds, 
<A NAME="1039"></A>the purpose of our play. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="1040"></A><I>The CHORUS turns and faces the audience.</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="1041"></A>Undoubtedly the comic poet who mounted the stage to praise himself in the 
<A NAME="1042"></A>parabasis would deserve to be handed over to the sticks or the beadles. 
<A NAME="1043"></A>Nevertheless, oh Muse, if it be right to esteem the most honest and illustrious 
<A NAME="1044"></A>of our comic writers at his proper value, permit our poet to say that he 
<A NAME="1045"></A>thinks he has deserved a glorious renown. First of all, he is the one who 
<A NAME="1046"></A>has compelled his rivals no longer to scoff at rags or to war with lice; 
<A NAME="1047"></A>and as for those Heracleses, always chewing and ever hungry, he was the 
<A NAME="1048"></A>first to cover them with ridicule and to chase them from the stage; he 
<A NAME="1049"></A>has also dismissed that slave, whom one never failed to set weeping before 
<A NAME="1050"></A>you, so that his comrade might have the chance of jeering at his stripes 
<A NAME="1051"></A>and might ask, "Wretch, what has happened to your hide? Has the lash rained 
<A NAME="1052"></A>an army of its thongs on you and laid your back waste?" After having delivered 
<A NAME="1053"></A>us from all these wearisome ineptitudes and these low buffooneries, he 
<A NAME="1054"></A>has built up for us a great art, like a palace with high towers, constructed 
<A NAME="1055"></A>of fine phrases, great thoughts and of jokes not common on the streets. 
<A NAME="1056"></A>Moreover it's not obscure private persons or women that he stages in his 
<A NAME="1057"></A>comedies; but, bold as Heracles, it's the very greatest whom he attacks, 
<A NAME="1058"></A>undeterred by the fetid stink of leather or the threats of hearts of mud. 
<A NAME="1059"></A>He has the right to say, "I am the first ever dared to go straight for 
<A NAME="1060"></A>that beast with the sharp teeth and the terrible eyes that flashed lambent 
<A NAME="1061"></A>fire like those of Cynna, surrounded by a hundred lewd flatterers, who 
<A NAME="1062"></A>spittle-licked him to his heart's content; it had a voice like a roaring 
<A NAME="1063"></A>torrent, the stench of a seal, the unwashed balls of a Lamia and the arse 
<A NAME="1064"></A>of a camel. I did not recoil in horror at the sight of such a monster, 
<A NAME="1065"></A>but fought him relentlessly to win your deliverance and that of the islanders." 
<A NAME="1066"></A>Such are the services which should be graven in your recollection and entitle 
<A NAME="1067"></A>me to your thanks. Yet I have not been seen frequenting the wrestling school 
<A NAME="1068"></A>intoxicated with success and trying to seduce young boys; but I took all 
<A NAME="1069"></A>my theatrical gear and returned straight home. I pained folk but little 
<A NAME="1070"></A>and caused them much amusement; my conscience rebuked me for nothing.

<A NAME="1073"></A>Hence both grown men and youths should be on my side and I likewise invite 
<A NAME="1074"></A>the bald to give me their votes; for, if I triumph, everyone will say, 
<A NAME="1075"></A>both at table and at festivals, "Carry this to the bald man, give these 
<A NAME="1076"></A>cakes to the bald one, do not grudge the poet whose talent shines as bright

<A NAME="1082"></A>banquets of us mortals and the festivals of the fortunate; these are the 
<A NAME="1083"></A>themes that inspire thy most poetic songs. And should Carcinus come to 
<A NAME="1084"></A>beg thee for admission with his sons to thy chorus, refuse all traffic 
<A NAME="1085"></A>with them; remember they are but gelded birds, stork-necked dancers, mannikins 
<A NAME="1086"></A>about as tall as a goat's turd, in fact machine-made poets. Contrary to 
<A NAME="1087"></A>all expectation, the father has at last managed to finish a piece, but

<A NAME="1094"></A>of Morsimus and that of Melanthius! Oh! what a bitter discordancy grated 
<A NAME="1095"></A>upon my ears that day when the tragic chorus was directed by this same 
<A NAME="1096"></A>Melanthius and his brother, these two Gorgons, these two Harpies, the plague 
<A NAME="1097"></A>of the seas, whose gluttonous bellies devour the entire race of fishes,
