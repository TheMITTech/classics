<A NAME="24"></A>Why, Xanthias! what are you doing, wretched man? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="25"></A><B>XANTHIAS</B>
<A NAME="26"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I am teaching myself how to rest; I have been awake and on 
<A NAME="27"></A>watch the whole night. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="28"></A><B>SOSIAS</B>
<A NAME="29"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>So you want to earn trouble for your ribs, eh? Don't you know 
<A NAME="30"></A>what sort of animal we are guarding here? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="31"></A><B>XANTHIAS</B>
<A NAME="32"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Aye indeed! but I want to put my cares to sleep for a while. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="33"></A><I>He falls asleep again.</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="34"></A><B>SOSIAS</B>
<A NAME="35"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Beware what you do. I too feel soft sleep spreading over my 
<A NAME="36"></A>eyes, </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="37"></A><B>XANTHIAS</B>
<A NAME="38"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Are you crazy, like a Corybant? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="39"></A><B>SOSIAS</B>
<A NAME="40"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>No! It's Bacchus who lulls me off. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="41"></A><B>XANTHIAS</B>
<A NAME="42"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Then you serve the same god as myself. just now a heavy slumber 
<A NAME="43"></A>settled on my eyelids like a hostile Mede; I nodded and, faith! I had a 
<A NAME="44"></A>wondrous dream. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="45"></A><B>SOSIAS</B>
<A NAME="46"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Indeed! and so had I. A dream such as I never had before. But 
<A NAME="47"></A>first tell me yours. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="48"></A><B>XANTHIAS</B>
<A NAME="49"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I saw an eagle, a gigantic bird, descend upon the market-place; 
<A NAME="50"></A>it seized a brazen buckler with its talons and bore it away into the highest 
<A NAME="51"></A>heavens; then I saw it was Cleonymus had thrown it away. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="52"></A><B>SOSIAS</B>
<A NAME="53"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>This Cleonymus is a riddle worth propounding among guests. 
<A NAME="54"></A>How can one and the same animal have cast away his buckler both on land, 
<A NAME="55"></A>in the sky and at sea? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="56"></A><B>XANTHIAS</B>
<A NAME="57"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Alas! what ill does such a dream portend for me? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="58"></A><B>SOSIAS</B>
<A NAME="59"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Rest undisturbed! Please the gods, no evil will befall you. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="60"></A><B>XANTHIAS</B>
<A NAME="61"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Nevertheless, it's a fatal omen when a man throws away his 
<A NAME="62"></A>weapons. But what was your dream? Let me hear. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="63"></A><B>SOSIAS</B>
<A NAME="64"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Oh! it is a dream of high import. It has reference to the hull 
<A NAME="65"></A>of the State; to nothing less. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="66"></A><B>XANTHIAS</B>
<A NAME="67"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Tell it to me quickly; show me its very keel. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="68"></A><B>SOSIAS</B>
<A NAME="69"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>In my first slumber I thought I saw sheep, wearing cloaks and 
<A NAME="70"></A>carrying staves, met in assembly on the Pnyx; a rapacious whale was haranguing 
<A NAME="71"></A>them and screaming like a pig that is being grilled. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="72"></A><B>XANTHIAS</B>
<A NAME="73"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Faugh! faugh! </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="74"></A><B>SOSIAS</B>
<A NAME="75"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>What's the matter? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="76"></A><B>XANTHIAS</B>
<A NAME="77"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Enough, enough, spare me. Your dream stinks vilely of old leather. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="78"></A><B>SOSIAS</B>
<A NAME="79"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Then this scoundrelly whale seized a balance and set to weighing 
<A NAME="80"></A>ox-fat. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="81"></A><B>XANTHIAS</B>
<A NAME="82"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Alas! it's our poor Athenian people, whom this accursed beast 
<A NAME="83"></A>wishes to cut up and despoil of their fat. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="84"></A><B>SOSIAS</B>
<A NAME="85"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Seated on the ground close to it, I saw Theorus, who had the 
<A NAME="86"></A>head of crow. Then Alcibiades said to me in his lisping way, "Do you thee? 
<A NAME="87"></A>Theoruth hath a crow'th head." </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="88"></A><B>XANTHIAS</B>
<A NAME="89"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Ah! that's very well lisped indeed! </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="90"></A><B>SOSIAS</B>
<A NAME="91"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Isn't this mighty strange? Theorus turning into a crow! 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="92"></A><B>XANTHIAS</B>
<A NAME="93"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>No, it is glorious. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="94"></A><B>SOSIAS</B>
<A NAME="95"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Why? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="96"></A><B>XANTHIAS</B>
<A NAME="97"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Why? He was a man and now he has suddenly become a crow; does 
<A NAME="98"></A>it not foretoken that he will take his flight from here and go to the crows? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="99"></A><B>SOSIAS</B>
<A NAME="100"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Interpreting dreams so aptly certainly is worth two obols. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="101"></A><B>XANTHIAS </B>
<A NAME="102"></A><I>turning to the audience</I><BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="103"></A>Come, I must explain the matter to the spectators. But first a few words 
<A NAME="104"></A>of preamble: expect nothing very high-flown from us, nor any jests stolen 
<A NAME="105"></A>from Megara; we have no slaves, who throw baskets of nuts to the spectators, 
<A NAME="106"></A>nor any Heracles to be robbed of his dinner, nor does Euripides get loaded 
<A NAME="107"></A>with contumely; and despite the happy chance that gave Cleon his fame we 
<A NAME="108"></A>shall not go out of our way to belabour him again, Our little subject is 
<A NAME="109"></A>not wanting in sense; it is well within your capacity and at the same time 
<A NAME="110"></A>cleverer than many vulgar comedies.-We have a master of great renown, who 
<A NAME="111"></A>is now sleeping up there on the other story. He has bidden us keep guard 
<A NAME="112"></A>over his father, whom he has locked in, so. that he may not go out. This 
<A NAME="113"></A>father has a curious complaint; not one of you could hit upon or guess 
<A NAME="114"></A>it, if I did not tell you.-Well then, try! I hear Amynias, the son of Pronapus, 
<A NAME="115"></A>over there, saying, "He is addicted to gambling." He's wrong! He is imputing 
<A NAME="116"></A>his own malady to others. Yet love is indeed the principal part of his 
<A NAME="117"></A>disease. Ah! here Sosias is telling Dercylus, "He loves drinking." Wrong 
<A NAME="118"></A>again! the love of wine is a good man's failing. "Well then," says Nicostratus 
<A NAME="119"></A>of the Scambonian deme, "he either loves sacrifices or else strangers." 
<A NAME="120"></A>God no! he is not fond of strangers, Nicostratus, for he who says "Philoxenus" 
<A NAME="121"></A>means a pederast, It's mere waste of time, you will not find it out. If 
<A NAME="122"></A>you want to know it, keep silence! I will tell your our master's complaint; 
<A NAME="123"></A>of all men, it is he who is fondest of the Heliaea. Thus, to be judging 
<A NAME="124"></A>is his hobby, and he groans if he is not sitting on the first seat. He 
<A NAME="125"></A>does not close an eye at night, and if he dozes off for an instant his 
<A NAME="126"></A>mind flies instantly to the clepsydra. He is so accustomed to hold the 
<A NAME="127"></A>balloting pebble, that he awakes with his three fingers pinched together 
<A NAME="128"></A>as if he were offering incense to the new moon. If he sees scribbled on 
<A NAME="129"></A>some doorway, "How charming is Demos, the son of Pyrilampes!" he will write 
<A NAME="130"></A>beneath it, "How charming is Cemos!" His cock crowed one evening; said 
<A NAME="131"></A>he, "He has had money from the accused to awaken me too late. As soon as 
<A NAME="132"></A>he rises from supper he bawls for his shoes and away he rushes down there 
<A NAME="133"></A>before dawn to sleep beforehand, glued fast to the column like an oyster. 
<A NAME="134"></A>He is a merciless judge, never failing to draw the convicting line and 
<A NAME="135"></A>return home with his nails full of wax like a bumble-bee. Fearing he might 
<A NAME="136"></A>run short of pebbles he keeps enough at home to cover a sea-beach, so that 
<A NAME="137"></A>he may have the means of recording his sentence. Such is his madness, and 
<A NAME="138"></A>all advice is useless; he only judges the more each day. So we keep him 
<A NAME="139"></A>under lock and key, to prevent his going out; for his son is broken-hearted 
<A NAME="140"></A>over this mania. At first he tried him with gentleness, wanted to persuade 
<A NAME="141"></A>him to wear the cloak no longer, to go out no more; unable to convince 
<A NAME="142"></A>him, he had him bathed and purified according to the ritual without any 
<A NAME="143"></A>greater success, and then handed him over to the Corybantes; but the old 
<A NAME="144"></A>man escaped them, and carrying off the kettledrum, rushed right into the 
<A NAME="145"></A>midst of the Heliasts. As Cybele could do nothing with her rites, his son 
<A NAME="146"></A>took him to Aegina and forcibly made him lie one night in the temple of 
<A NAME="147"></A>Asclepius, the God of Healing, but before daylight there he was to be seen 
<A NAME="148"></A>at the gate of the tribunal. Since then we let him go out no more, but 
<A NAME="149"></A>he escaped us by the drains or by the skylight, so we stuffed up every 
<A NAME="150"></A>opening with old rags and made all secure; then he drove short sticks into 
<A NAME="151"></A>the wall and sprang from rung to rung like a magpie. Now we have stretched-nets 
<A NAME="152"></A>all around the court and we keep watch and ward. The old man's name is 
<A NAME="153"></A>Philocleon, it's the best name he could have, and the son is called Edelycleon, 
<A NAME="154"></A>for he is a man very fit to cure an insolent fellow of his boasting.

<A NAME="167"></A>through the bath drain. You there, put all your weight against the door.

<A NAME="181"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Ah! that's the most acrid of all. But you shall not get out. 
<A NAME="182"></A>Where is the chimney cover? Come down again. Now, up with another cross-bar. 
<A NAME="183"></A>Now look out for some fresh dodge. But am I not the most unfortunate of 
<A NAME="184"></A>men? Henceforward I shall only be called the son of Capnius.

<A NAME="229"></A><B>BDELYCLEON</B>
<A NAME="230"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Yes, but I have not swallowed the hook; I scented the trick.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="234"></A>Stupid old ass, are you weeping because you are going to be sold? Come,

<A NAME="728"></A>Others, again, cut jokes; they fancy I shall be appeased if I won If we

<A NAME="730"></A>by the hand, both boys and girls, who prostrate themselves and whine with 
<A NAME="731"></A>one accord, and then the father, trembling as if before a god, beseeches 
<A NAME="732"></A>me not to condemn him out of pity for them, "If you love the voice of the 
<A NAME="733"></A>lamb, have pity on my sons"; and because I am fond of little sows, I must 
<A NAME="734"></A>yield to his daughter's prayers. Then we relax the heat of our wrath a

<A NAME="849"></A>salt fish, wine, tapestries, cheese, honey, chaplets, necklets, drinking-cups, 
<A NAME="850"></A>all that yields pleasure and health. And you, their master, to you as a

<A NAME="857"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Is it not the worst of all slaveries to see all these wretches 
<A NAME="858"></A>and their flatterers, whom they gorge with gold, at the head of affairs? 
<A NAME="859"></A>As for you, you are content with the three obols which they give you and 
<A NAME="860"></A>which you have so painfully earned in the galleys, in battles and sieges. 
<A NAME="861"></A>But what I stomach least is that you go to sit on the tribunal by order. 
<A NAME="862"></A>Some young fairy, the son of Chaereas, to wit, enters your house wiggling 
<A NAME="863"></A>his arse, foul with debauchery, on his straddling legs and charges you 
<A NAME="864"></A>to come and judge at daybreak, and precisely to the minute. "He who presents 
<A NAME="865"></A>himself after the opening of the Court," says he, "will not get the triobolus." 
<A NAME="866"></A>But he himself, though he arrives late, will nevertheless get his drachma 
<A NAME="867"></A>as a public advocate. If an accused man makes him some present, he shares 
<A NAME="868"></A>it with a colleague and the pair agree to arrange the matter like two sawyers, 
<A NAME="869"></A>one of whom pulls and the other pushes. As for you, you have only eyes

<A NAME="877"></A>I know not why you let yourself be fooled by these folk who call themselves 
<A NAME="878"></A>the people's friends. A myriad of towns obey you, from the Euxine to Sardis. 
<A NAME="879"></A>What do you gain thereby? Nothing but this miserable pay, and even that 
<A NAME="880"></A>is like the oil with which the flock of wool is impregnated and is doled 
<A NAME="881"></A>to you drop by drop, just enough to keep you from dying of hunger. They 
<A NAME="882"></A>want you to be poor, and I will tell you why. It is so that you may know 
<A NAME="883"></A>only those who nourish you, and so that, if it pleases them to loose you 
<A NAME="884"></A>against one of their foes, you shall leap upon him with fury. If they wished 
<A NAME="885"></A>to assure the well-being of the people, nothing would be easier for them. 
<A NAME="886"></A>We have now a thousand towns that pay us tribute; let them comand each

<A NAME="890"></A>to which the great name of their country and the trophies of Marathon give

<A NAME="1342"></A><BR><BR>The poet has a reproach to make against his audience; he says you 
<A NAME="1343"></A>have ill-treated him in return for the many services he has rendered you. 
<A NAME="1344"></A>At first he kept himself in the background and lent help secretly to other 
<A NAME="1345"></A>poets, and like the prophetic Genius, who hid himself in the belly of Eurycles, 
<A NAME="1346"></A>slipped within the spirit of another and whispered to him many a comic 
<A NAME="1347"></A>hit. Later he ran the risks of the theatre on his own account, with his 
<A NAME="1348"></A>face uncovered, and dared to guide his Muse unaided. Though overladen with 
<A NAME="1349"></A>success and honours more than any of your poets, indeed despite all his 
<A NAME="1350"></A>glory, he does not yet believe he has attained his goal; his heart is not 
<A NAME="1351"></A>swollen with pride and he does not seek to seduce the young folk in the 
<A NAME="1352"></A>wrestling school. If any lover runs up to him to complain because he is 
<A NAME="1353"></A>furious at seeing the object of his passion derided on the stage, he takes 
<A NAME="1354"></A>no heed of such reproaches, for he is inspired only with honest motives 
<A NAME="1355"></A>and his Muse is no pander. From the very outset of his dramatic career 
<A NAME="1356"></A>he has disdained to assail those who were men, but with a courage worthy 
<A NAME="1357"></A>of Heracles himself he attacked the most formidable monsters, and at the 
<A NAME="1358"></A>beginning went straight for that beast with the sharp teeth, with the terrible 
<A NAME="1359"></A>eyes that flashed lambent fire like those of Cynna, surround
