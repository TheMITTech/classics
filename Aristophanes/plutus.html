<A NAME="25"></A><B>CARIO</B>
<A NAME="26"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>What an unhappy fate, great gods, to be the slave of a fool! 
<A NAME="27"></A>A servant may give the best of advice, but if his master does not follow 
<A NAME="28"></A>it, the pool slave must inevitably have his share in the disaster; for 
<A NAME="29"></A>fortune does not allow him to dispose of his own body, it belongs to his 
<A NAME="30"></A>master who has bought it. Alas! 'tis the way of the world. But the god, 
<A NAME="31"></A>Apollo,  </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="32"></A><I>in tragic style</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="33"></A>whose oracles the Pythian priestess on her golden tripod makes known to 
<A NAME="34"></A>us, deserves my censure, for surely he is a physician and a cunning diviner; 
<A NAME="35"></A>and yet my master is leaving his temple infected with mere madness and 
<A NAME="36"></A>insists on following a blind man. Is this not opposed to all good sense? 
<A NAME="37"></A>It is for us, who see clearly, to guide those who don't; whereas he clings 
<A NAME="38"></A>to the trail of a blind fellow and compels me to do the same without answering 
<A NAME="39"></A>my questions with ever a word.   </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="40"></A><I>To CHREMYLUS</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="41"></A>Aye, master, unless you tell me why we are following this unknown fellow, 
<A NAME="42"></A>I will not be silent, but I will worry and torment you, for you cannot 
<A NAME="43"></A>beat me because of my sacred chaplet of laurel. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="44"></A><B>CHREMYLUS</B>
<A NAME="45"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>No, but if you worry me I will take off your chaplets, and 
<A NAME="46"></A>then you will only get a sounder thrashing. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="47"></A><B>CARIO</B>
<A NAME="48"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>That's an old song! I am going to leave you no peace till you 
<A NAME="49"></A>have told me who this man is; and if I ask it, it's entirely because of 
<A NAME="50"></A>my interest in you. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="51"></A><B>CHREMYLUS</B>
<A NAME="52"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Well, be it so. I will reveal it to you as being the most faithful 
<A NAME="53"></A>and the most rascally of all my servants. I honoured the gods and did what 
<A NAME="54"></A>was right, and yet I was none the less poor and unfortunate. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="55"></A><B>CARIO</B>
<A NAME="56"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I know it but too well. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="57"></A><B>CHREMYLUS</B>
<A NAME="58"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Others amassed wealth-the sacrilegious, the demagogues, the 
<A NAME="59"></A>informers, indeed every sort of rascal. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="60"></A><B>CARIO</B>
<A NAME="61"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I believe you. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="62"></A><B>CHREMYLUS</B>
<A NAME="63"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Therefore I came to consult the oracle of the god, not on my 
<A NAME="64"></A>own account, for my unfortunate life is nearing its end, but for my only 
<A NAME="65"></A>son; I wanted to ask Apollo if it was necessary for him to become a thorough 
<A NAME="66"></A>knave and renounce his virtuous principles, since that seemed to me to 
<A NAME="67"></A>be the only way to succeed in life. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="68"></A><B>CARIO  </B>
<A NAME="69"></A><I>with ironic gravity</I><BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="70"></A>And with what responding tones did the sacred tripod resound? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="71"></A><B>CHREMYLUS</B>
<A NAME="72"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>You shall know. The god ordered me in plain terms to follow 
<A NAME="73"></A>the first man I should meet upon leaving the temple and to persuade him 
<A NAME="74"></A>to accompany me home. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="75"></A><B>CARIO</B>
<A NAME="76"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>And who was the first one you met? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="77"></A><B>CHREMYLUS</B>
<A NAME="78"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>This blind man. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="79"></A><B>CARIO</B>
<A NAME="80"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>And you are stupid enough not to understand the meaning of 
<A NAME="81"></A>such an answer! Why, the god was advising you thereby, and that in the 
<A NAME="82"></A>clearest possible way, to bring up your son according to the fashion of 
<A NAME="83"></A>your country. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="84"></A><B>CHREMYLUS</B>
<A NAME="85"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>What makes you think that? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="86"></A><B>CARIO</B>
<A NAME="87"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Is it not evident to the blind, that nowadays to do nothing 
<A NAME="88"></A>that is right is the best way to get on? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="89"></A><B>CHREMYLUS</B>
<A NAME="90"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>No, that is not the meaning of the oracle; there must be another 
<A NAME="91"></A>that is nobler. If this blind man would tell us who he is and why and with 
<A NAME="92"></A>what object he has led us here, we should no doubt understand what our 
<A NAME="93"></A>oracle really does mean. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="94"></A><B>CARIO  </B>
<A NAME="95"></A><I>to PLUTUS</I><BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="96"></A>Come, tell us at once who you are, or I shall give effect to my threat. 
<A NAME="97"></A>  </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="98"></A><I>He menaces him.</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="99"></A>And quick too, be quick, I say. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="100"></A><B>PLUTUS</B>
<A NAME="101"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I'll thrash you. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="102"></A><B>CARIO  </B>
<A NAME="103"></A><I>to CHREMYLUS</I><BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="104"></A>Do you understand who he says he is? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="105"></A><B>CHREMYLUS</B>
<A NAME="106"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>It's to you and not to me that he replies thus: your mode of 
<A NAME="107"></A>questioning him was ill-advised.   </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="108"></A><I>To PLUTUS</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="109"></A>Come, friend, if you care to oblige an honest man, answer me. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="110"></A><B>PLUTUS</B>
<A NAME="111"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I'll knock you down. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="112"></A><B>CARIO  </B>
<A NAME="113"></A><I>sarcastically</I><BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="114"></A>Ah! what a pleasant fellow and what a delightful prophecy the god has given 
<A NAME="115"></A>you! </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="116"></A><B>CHREMYLUS  </B>
<A NAME="117"></A><I>to PLUTUS</I><BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="118"></A>By Demeter, you'll have no reason to laugh presently. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="119"></A><B>CARIO</B>
<A NAME="120"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>If you don't speak, you wretch, I will surely do you an ill 
<A NAME="121"></A>turn. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="122"></A><B>PLUTUS</B>
<A NAME="123"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Friends, take yourselves off and leave me. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="124"></A><B>CHREMYLUS</B>
<A NAME="125"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>That we very certainly shan't. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="126"></A><B>CARIO</B>
<A NAME="127"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>This, master, is the best thing to do. I'll undertake to secure 
<A NAME="128"></A>him the most frightful death; I will lead him to the verge of a precipice 
<A NAME="129"></A>and then leave him there, so that he'll break his neck when he pitches 
<A NAME="130"></A>over. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="131"></A><B>CHREMYLUS</B>
<A NAME="132"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Well then, seize him right away. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="133"></A><I>CARIO does so.</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="134"></A><B>PLUTUS</B>
<A NAME="135"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Oh, no! Have mercy! </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="136"></A><B>CHREMYLUS</B>
<A NAME="137"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Will thou speak then? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="138"></A><B>PLUTUS</B>
<A NAME="139"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>But if you learn who I am, I know well that you will ill-use 
<A NAME="140"></A>me and will let me go again. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="141"></A><B>CHREMYLUS</B>
<A NAME="142"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I call the gods to witness that you have naught to fear if 
<A NAME="143"></A>you will only speak. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="144"></A><B>PLUTUS</B>
<A NAME="145"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Well then, first unhand me. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="146"></A><B>CHREMYLUS</B>
<A NAME="147"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>There! we set you free. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="148"></A><B>PLUTUS</B>
<A NAME="149"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Listen then, since I must reveal what I had intended to keep 
<A NAME="150"></A>a secret. I am Plutus. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="151"></A><B>CARIO</B>
<A NAME="152"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Oh! you wretched rascal! You Plutus all the while, and you 
<A NAME="153"></A>never said so! </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="154"></A><B>CHREMYLUS</B>
<A NAME="155"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>You, Plutus, and in this piteous guise! Oh, Phoebus Apollo! 
<A NAME="156"></A>oh, ye gods of heaven and hell! Oh, Zeus! is it really and truly as you 
<A NAME="157"></A>say? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="158"></A><B>PLUTUS</B>
<A NAME="159"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Yes. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="160"></A><B>CHREMYLUS</B>
<A NAME="161"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Plutus' very own self? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="162"></A><B>PLUTUS</B>
<A NAME="163"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>His own very self and none other. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="164"></A><B>CHREMYLUS</B>
<A NAME="165"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>But tell me, how come you're so squalid? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="166"></A><B>PLUTUS</B>
<A NAME="167"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I have just left Patrocles' house, who has not had a bath since 
<A NAME="168"></A>his birth. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="169"></A><B>CHREMYLUS</B>
<A NAME="170"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>But your infirmity; how did that happen? Tell me. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="171"></A><B>PLUTUS</B>
<A NAME="172"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Zeus inflicted it on me, because of his jealousy of-mankind. 
<A NAME="173"></A>When I was young, I threatened him that I would only go to the just, the 
<A NAME="174"></A>wise, the men of ordered life; to prevent my distinguishing these, he struck 
<A NAME="175"></A>me with blindness' so much does he envy the good! </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="176"></A><B>CHREMYLUS</B>
<A NAME="177"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>And yet, it's only the upright and just who honour him. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="178"></A><B>PLUTUS</B>
<A NAME="179"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Quite true. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="180"></A><B>CHREMYLUS</B>
<A NAME="181"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Therefore, if ever you recovered your sight, you would shun 
<A NAME="182"></A>the wicked? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="183"></A><B>PLUTUS</B>
<A NAME="184"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Undoubtedly. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="185"></A><B>CHREMYLUS</B>
<A NAME="186"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>You would visit the good? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="187"></A><B>PLUTUS</B>
<A NAME="188"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Assuredly. It is a very long time since I saw them. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="189"></A><B>CARIO  </B>
<A NAME="190"></A><I>to the audience</I><BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="191"></A>That's not astonishing. I, who see clearly, don't see a single one. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="192"></A><B>PLUTUS</B>
<A NAME="193"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Now let me leave you, for I have told you everything. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="194"></A><B>CHREMYLUS</B>
<A NAME="195"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>No, certainly not! we shall fasten ourselves on to you faster 
<A NAME="196"></A>than ever. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="197"></A><B>PLUTUS</B>
<A NAME="198"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Did I not tell you, you were going to plague me? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="199"></A><B>CHREMYLUS</B>
<A NAME="200"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Oh! I adjure you, believe what I say and don't leave me; for 
<A NAME="201"></A>you will seek in vain for a more honest man than myself. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="202"></A><B>CARIO</B>
<A NAME="203"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>There is only one man more worthy; and that is I. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="204"></A><B>PLUTUS</B>
<A NAME="205"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>All talk like this, but as soon as they secure my favours and 
<A NAME="206"></A>grow rich, their wickedness knows no bounds. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="207"></A><B>CHREMYLUS</B>
<A NAME="208"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>And yet all men are not wicked. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="209"></A><B>PLUTUS</B>
<A NAME="210"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>All. There's no exception. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="211"></A><B>CARIO</B>
<A NAME="212"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>You shall pay for that opinion. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="213"></A><B>CHREMYLUS</B>
<A NAME="214"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Listen to what happiness there is in store for you, if you 
<A NAME="215"></A>but stay with us. I have hope; aye, I have good hope with the god's help 
<A NAME="216"></A>to deliver you from that blindness, in fact to restore your sight. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="217"></A><B>PLUTUS</B>
<A NAME="218"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Oh! do nothing of the kind, for I don't wish to recover it. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="219"></A><B>CHREMYLUS</B>
<A NAME="220"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>What's that you say? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="221"></A><B>CARIO</B>
<A NAME="222"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>This fellow hugs his own misery. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="223"></A><B>PLUTUS</B>
<A NAME="224"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>If you were mad enough to cure me, and Zeus heard of it, he 
<A NAME="225"></A>would overwhelm me with his anger. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="226"></A><B>CHREMYLUS</B>
<A NAME="227"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>And is he not doing this now by leaving you to grope your wandering 
<A NAME="228"></A>way? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="229"></A><B>PLUTUS</B>
<A NAME="230"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I don't know; but I'm horribly afraid of him. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="231"></A><B>CHREMYLUS</B>
<A NAME="232"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Indeed? Ah! you are the biggest poltroon of all the gods! Why, 
<A NAME="233"></A>Zeus with his throne and his lightnings would not be worth an obolus if 
<A NAME="234"></A>you recovered your sight, were it but for a few moments. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="235"></A><B>PLUTUS</B>
<A NAME="236"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Impious man, don't talk like that. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="237"></A><B>CHREMYLUS</B>
<A NAME="238"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Fear nothing! I will prove to you that you are far more powerful 
<A NAME="239"></A>and mightier than he. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="240"></A><B>PLUTUS</B>
<A NAME="241"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I mightier than he? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="242"></A><B>CHREMYLUS</B>
<A NAME="243"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Aye, by heaven!   </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="244"></A><I>To CARIO</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="245"></A>For instance, what is the basis of the power that Zeus wields over the 
<A NAME="246"></A>other gods? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="247"></A><B>CARIO</B>
<A NAME="248"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Money; he has so much of it. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="249"></A><B>CHREMYLUS</B>
<A NAME="250"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>And who gives it to him? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="251"></A><B>CARIO  </B>
<A NAME="252"></A><I>pointing to Plutus</I><BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="253"></A>This fellow. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="254"></A><B>CHREMYLUS</B>
<A NAME="255"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>If sacrifices are offered to him, is not Plutus their cause? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="256"></A><B>CARIO</B>
<A NAME="257"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Undoubtedly, for it's wealth that all demand and clamour most 
<A NAME="258"></A>loudly for. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="259"></A><B>CHREMYLUS</B>
<A NAME="260"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Thus it's Plutus who is the fount of all the honours rendered 
<A NAME="261"></A>to Zeus, whose worship he can wither up at the root, if it so pleases him. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="262"></A><B>PLUTUS</B>
<A NAME="263"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>And how so? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="264"></A><B>CHREMYLUS</B>
<A NAME="265"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Not an ox, nor a cake, nor indeed anything at all could be 
<A NAME="266"></A>offered, if you did not wish it. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="267"></A><B>PLUTUS</B>

<A NAME="1084"></A>especially recommending us to keep silent should we hear any noise. There 
<A NAME="1085"></A>we were all lying down quite quietly. I could not sleep; I was thinking 
<A NAME="1086"></A>of a certain stew-pan full of pap placed close to an old woman and just 
<A NAME="1087"></A>behind her head. I had a furious longing to slip towards that side. But 
<A NAME="1088"></A>just as I was lifting my head, I noticed the priest, who was sweeping off 
<A NAME="1089"></A>both the cakes and the figs on the sacred table; then he made the round 
<A NAME="1090"></A>of the altars and sanctified the cakes that remained, by stowing them away 
<A NAME="1091"></A>in a bag. I therefore resolved to follow such a pious example and made

<A NAME="1098"></A>like god." On hearing the noise I made the old woman put out her hand, 
<A NAME="1099"></A>but I hissed and bit it, just as a sacred serpent might have done. Quick 
<A NAME="1100"></A>she drew back her hand, slipped down into the bed with her head beneath 
<A NAME="1101"></A>the coverlets and never moved again; only she let flee a fart in her fear 
<A NAME="1102"></A>which stank worse than a weasel. As for myself, I swallowed a goodly portion
