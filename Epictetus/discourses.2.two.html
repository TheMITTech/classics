<A NAME="10"></A><B>Chapter 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>That confidence is not inconsistent with caution
<A NAME="12"></A><BR><BR>The opinion of the philosophers, perhaps, seems to some to be a 
<A NAME="13"></A>paradox; but still let us examine as well as we can, if it is true that 
<A NAME="14"></A>it is possible to do everything both with caution and with confidence. 
<A NAME="15"></A>For caution seems to be in a manner contrary to confidence, and contraries 
<A NAME="16"></A>are in no way consistent. That which seems to many to be a paradox in the 
<A NAME="17"></A>matter under consideration in my opinion is of this kind: if we asserted 
<A NAME="18"></A>that we ought to employ caution and in the same things, men might justly 
<A NAME="19"></A>accuse us of bringing together things which cannot be united. But now where 
<A NAME="20"></A>is the difficulty in what is said? for if these things are true, which 
<A NAME="21"></A>have been often said and often proved, that the nature of good is in the 
<A NAME="22"></A>use of appearances, and the nature of evil likewise, and that things independent 
<A NAME="23"></A>of our will do not admit either the nature of evil nor of good, what paradox 
<A NAME="24"></A>do the philosophers assert if they say that where things are not dependent 
<A NAME="25"></A>on the will, there you should employ confidence, but where they are dependent 
<A NAME="26"></A>on the will, there you should employ caution? For if the bad consists in 
<A NAME="27"></A>a bad exercise of the will, caution ought only to be used where things 
<A NAME="28"></A>are dependent on the will. But if things independent of the will and not 
<A NAME="29"></A>in our power are nothing to us, with respect to these we must employ confidence; 
<A NAME="30"></A>and thus we shall both be cautious and confident, and indeed confident 
<A NAME="31"></A>because of our caution. For by employing caution toward things which are 
<A NAME="32"></A>really bad, it will result that we shall have confidence with respect to 
<A NAME="33"></A>things which are not so.
<A NAME="34"></A><BR><BR>We are then in the condition of deer; when they flee from the huntsmen's 
<A NAME="35"></A>feathers in fright, whither do they turn and in what do they seek refuge 
<A NAME="36"></A>as safe? They turn to the nets, and thus they perish by confounding things 
<A NAME="37"></A>which are objects of fear with things that they ought not to fear. Thus 
<A NAME="38"></A>we also act: in what cases do we fear? In things which are independent 
<A NAME="39"></A>of the will. In what cases, on the contrary, do we behave with confidence, 
<A NAME="40"></A>as if there were no danger? In things dependent on the will. To be deceived 
<A NAME="41"></A>then, or to act rashly, or shamelessly or with base desire to seek something, 
<A NAME="42"></A>does not concern us at all, if we only hit the mark in things which are 
<A NAME="43"></A>independent of our will. But where there is death, or exile or pain or 
<A NAME="44"></A>infamy, there we attempt or examine to run away, there we are struck with 
<A NAME="45"></A>terror. Therefore, as we may expect it to happen with those who err in 
<A NAME="46"></A>the greatest matters, we convert natural confidence into audacity, desperation, 
<A NAME="47"></A>rashness, shamelessness; and we convert natural caution and modesty into 
<A NAME="48"></A>cowardice and meanness, which are full of fear and confusion. For if a 
<A NAME="49"></A>man should transfer caution to those things in which the will may be exercised 
<A NAME="50"></A>and the acts of the will, he will immediately, by willing to be cautious, 
<A NAME="51"></A>have also the power of avoiding what he chooses: but if he transfer it 
<A NAME="52"></A>to the things which are not in his power and will, and attempt to avoid 
<A NAME="53"></A>the things which are in the power of others, he will of necessity fear, 
<A NAME="54"></A>he will be unstable, he will be disturbed. For death or pain is not formidable, 
<A NAME="55"></A>but the fear of pain or death. For this reason we commend the poet who 
<A NAME="56"></A>said
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR><B>Not death is evil, but a shameful death.</B> Confidence then 
<A NAME="58"></A>ought to be employed against death, and caution against the fear of death. 
<A NAME="59"></A>But now we do the contrary, and employ against death the attempt to escape; 
<A NAME="60"></A>and to our opinion about it we employ carelessness, rashness and indifference. 
<A NAME="61"></A>These things Socrates properly used to call "tragic masks"; for as to children 
<A NAME="62"></A>masks appear terrible and fearful from inexperience, we also are affected 
<A NAME="63"></A>in like manner by events for no other reason than children are by masks. 
<A NAME="64"></A>For what is a child? Ignorance. What is a child? Want of knowledge. For 
<A NAME="65"></A>when a child knows these things, he is in no way inferior to us. What is 
<A NAME="66"></A>death? A "tragic mask." Turn it and examine it. See, it does not bite. 
<A NAME="67"></A>The poor body must be separated from the spirit either now or later, as 
<A NAME="68"></A>it was separated from it before. Why, then, are you troubled, if it be 
<A NAME="69"></A>separated now? for if it is not separated now, it will be separated afterward. 
<A NAME="70"></A>Why? That the period of the universe may be completed, for it has need 
<A NAME="71"></A>of the present, and of the future, and of the past. What is pain? A mask. 
<A NAME="72"></A>Turn it and examine it. The poor flesh is moved roughly, then, on the contrary, 
<A NAME="73"></A>smoothly. If this does not satisfy you, the door is open: if it does, bear. 
<A NAME="74"></A>For the door ought to be open for all occasions; and so we have no 
<A NAME="75"></A>trouble.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR>What then is the fruit of these opinions? It is that which ought 
<A NAME="77"></A>to he the most noble and the most becoming to those who are really educated, 
<A NAME="78"></A>release from perturbation, release from fear, freedom. For in these matters 
<A NAME="79"></A>we must not believe the many, who say that free persons only ought to be 
<A NAME="80"></A>educated, but we should rather believe the philosophers, who say that the 
<A NAME="81"></A>educated only are free. "How is this?" In this manner. Is freedom anything 
<A NAME="82"></A>else than the power of living as we choose? "Nothing else." Tell me then, 
<A NAME="83"></A>ye men, do you wish to live in error? "We do not." No one then who lives 
<A NAME="84"></A>in error is free. Do you wish to live in fear? Do you wish to live in sorrow? 
<A NAME="85"></A>Do you wish to live in perturbation? "By no means." No one, then, who is 
<A NAME="86"></A>in a state of fear or sorrow or perturbation is free; but whoever is delivered 
<A NAME="87"></A>from sorrows and fears and perturbations, he is at the same time also delivered 
<A NAME="88"></A>from servitude. How then can we continue to believe you, most dear legislators, 
<A NAME="89"></A>when you say, "We only allow free persons to be educated?" For philosophers 
<A NAME="90"></A>say we allow none to be free except the educated; that is, God does not 
<A NAME="91"></A>allow it. "When then a man has turned round before the praetor his own 
<A NAME="92"></A>slave, has he done nothing?" He has done something. "What?" He has turned 
<A NAME="93"></A>round his own slave before the praetor. "Has he done nothing, more?" Yes: 
<A NAME="94"></A>he is also bound to pay for him the tax called the twentieth. "Well then, 
<A NAME="95"></A>is not the man who has gone through this ceremony become free?" No more 
<A NAME="96"></A>than he is become free from perturbations. Have you who are able to turn 
<A NAME="97"></A>round others no master? is not money your master, or a girl or a boy, or 
<A NAME="98"></A>some tyrant, or some friend of the tyrant? why do you tremble then when 
<A NAME="99"></A>you are going off to any trial of this kind? It is for this reason that 
<A NAME="100"></A>I often say: Study and hold in readiness these principles by which you 
<A NAME="101"></A>may determine what those things are with reference to which you ought to 
<A NAME="102"></A>have confidence, and those things with reference to which you ought to 
<A NAME="103"></A>be cautious: courageous in that which does not depend on your will; cautious 
<A NAME="104"></A>in that which does depend on it.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR>"Well have I not read to you, and do you not know what I was doing?" 
<A NAME="106"></A>In what? "In my little dissertations." Show me how you are with respect 
<A NAME="107"></A>to desire and aversion; and show if you do not fail in getting what you 
<A NAME="108"></A>wish, me and if you do not fall into the things which you would avoid: 
<A NAME="109"></A>but as to these long and laboured sentences, you will take them and blot 
<A NAME="110"></A>them out.
<A NAME="111"></A><BR><BR>"What then did not Socrates write?" And who wrote so much? But 
<A NAME="112"></A>how? As he could not always have at hand one to argue against his principles 
<A NAME="113"></A>or to be argued against in turn, he used to argue with and examine himself, 
<A NAME="114"></A>and he was always treating at least some one subject in a practical way. 
<A NAME="115"></A>These are the things which a philosopher writes. But little dissertations 
<A NAME="116"></A>and that method, which I speak of, he leaves to others, to the stupid, 
<A NAME="117"></A>or to those happy men who being free from perturbations have leisure, or 
<A NAME="118"></A>to such as are too foolish to reckon consequences.
<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR>And will you now, when the opportunity invites, go and display 
<A NAME="120"></A>those things which you possess, and recite them, and make an idle show, 
<A NAME="121"></A>and say, "See how I make dialogues?" Do not so, my man: but rather say: 
<A NAME="122"></A>"See how I am not disappointed of that which I desire. See how I do not 
<A NAME="123"></A>fall into that which I would avoid. Set death before me, and you will see. 
<A NAME="124"></A>Set before me pain, prison, disgrace and condemnation." This is the proper 
<A NAME="125"></A>display of a young man who is come out of the schools. But leave the rest 
<A NAME="126"></A>to others, and let no one ever hear you say a word about these things; 
<A NAME="127"></A>and if any man commends you for them, do not allow it; but think that you 
<A NAME="128"></A>are nobody and know nothing. Only show that you know this, how never to 
<A NAME="129"></A>be disappointed in your desire and how never to fall into that which you 
<A NAME="130"></A>would avoid. Let others labour at forensic causes, problems and syllogisms: 
<A NAME="131"></A>do you labour at thinking about death, chains, the rack, exile; and do 
<A NAME="132"></A>all this with confidence and reliance on him who has called you to these 
<A NAME="133"></A>sufferings, who has judged you worthy of the place in which, being stationed, 
<A NAME="134"></A>you will show what things the rational governing power can do when it takes 
<A NAME="135"></A>its stand against the forces which are not within the power of our will. 
<A NAME="136"></A>And thus this paradox will no longer appear either impossible or a paradox, 
<A NAME="137"></A>that a man ought to be at the same time cautious and courageous: courageous 
<A NAME="138"></A>toward the things which do not depend on the will, and cautious in things 
<A NAME="139"></A>which are within the power of the will.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="140"></A><B>Chapter 2</B>

<A NAME="141"></A><BR><BR>Of Tranquillity
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR>Consider, you who are going into court, what you wish to maintain 
<A NAME="143"></A>and what you wish to succeed in. For if you wish to maintain a will conformable 
<A NAME="144"></A>to nature, you have every security, every facility, you have no troubles. 
<A NAME="145"></A>For if you wish to maintain what is in your own power and is naturally 
<A NAME="146"></A>free, and if you are content with these, what else do you care for? For 
<A NAME="147"></A>who is the master of such things? Who can take them away? If you choose 
<A NAME="148"></A>to be modest and faithful, who shall not allow you to be so? If you choose 
<A NAME="149"></A>not to be restrained or compelled, who shall compel you to desire what 
<A NAME="150"></A>you think that you ought not to desire? who shall compel you to avoid what 
<A NAME="151"></A>you do not think fit to avoid? But what do you say? The judge will determine 
<A NAME="152"></A>against you something that appears formidable; but that you should also 
<A NAME="153"></A>suffer in trying to avoid it, how can he do that? When then the pursuit 
<A NAME="154"></A>of objects and the avoiding of them are in your power, what else do you 
<A NAME="155"></A>care for? Let this be your preface, this your narrative, this your confirmation, 
<A NAME="156"></A>this your victory, this your peroration, this your applause.
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR>Therefore Socrates said to one who was reminding him to prepare 
<A NAME="158"></A>for his trial, "Do you not think then that I have been preparing for it 
<A NAME="159"></A>all my life?" By what kind of preparation? "I have maintained that which 
<A NAME="160"></A>was in my own power." How then? "I have never done anything unjust either 
<A NAME="161"></A>in my private or in my public life."
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR>But if you wish to maintain externals also, your poor body, your 
<A NAME="163"></A>little property and your little estimation, I advise you to make from this 
<A NAME="164"></A>moment all possible preparation, and then consider both the nature of your 
<A NAME="165"></A>judge and your adversary. If it is necessary to embrace his knees, embrace 
<A NAME="166"></A>his knees; if to weep, weep; if to groan, groan. For when you have subjected 
<A NAME="167"></A>to externals what is your own, then be a slave and do not resist, and do 
<A NAME="168"></A>not sometimes choose to be a slave, and sometimes not choose, but with 
<A NAME="169"></A>all your mind be one or the other, either free or a slave, either instructed 
<A NAME="170"></A>or uninstructed, either a well-bred cock or a mean one, either endure to 
<A NAME="171"></A>be beaten until you die or yield at once; and let it not happen to you 
<A NAME="172"></A>to receive many stripes and then to yield. But if these things are base, 
<A NAME="173"></A>determine immediately: "Where is the nature of evil and good? It is where 
<A NAME="174"></A>truth is: where truth is and where nature is, there is caution: where truth 
<A NAME="175"></A>is, there is courage where nature is."
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR>For what do you think? do you think that, if Socrates had wished 
<A NAME="177"></A>to preserve externals, he would have come forward and said: "Anytus and 
<A NAME="178"></A>Meletus can certainly kill me, but to harm me they are not able?" Was he 
<A NAME="179"></A>so foolish as not to see that this way leads not to the preservation of 
<A NAME="180"></A>life and fortune, but to another end? What is the reason then that he takes 
<A NAME="181"></A>no account of his adversaries, and even irritates them? Just in the same 
<A NAME="182"></A>way my friend Heraclitus, who had a little suit in Rhodes about a bit of 
<A NAME="183"></A>land, and had proved to the judges that his case was just, said, when he 
<A NAME="184"></A>had come to the peroration of his speech, "I will neither entreat you nor 
<A NAME="185"></A>do I care what wi judgment you will give, and it is you rather than I who 
<A NAME="186"></A>are on your trial." And thus he ended the business. What need was there 
<A NAME="187"></A>of this? Only do not entreat; but do not also say, "I. do not entreat"; 
<A NAME="188"></A>unless there is a fit occasion to irritate purposely the judges, as was 
<A NAME="189"></A>the case with Socrates. And you, if you are preparing such a peroration, 
<A NAME="190"></A>why do you wait, why do you obey the order to submit to trial? For if you 
<A NAME="191"></A>wish to be crucified, wait and the cross will come: but if you choose to 
<A NAME="192"></A>submit and to plead your cause as well as you can, you must do what is 
<A NAME="193"></A>consistent with this object, provided you maintain what is your 
<A NAME="194"></A>own.
<A NAME="195"></A><BR><BR>For this reason also it is ridiculous to say, "Suggest something 
<A NAME="196"></A>to me." What should I suggest to you? "Well, form my mind so as to accommodate 
<A NAME="197"></A>itself to any event." Why that is just the same as if a man who is ignorant 
<A NAME="198"></A>of letters should say, "Tell me what to write when any name is proposed 
<A NAME="199"></A>to me." For if I should tell him to write Dion, and then another should 
<A NAME="200"></A>come and propose to him not the name of Dion but that of Theon, what will 
<A NAME="201"></A>be done? what will he write? But if you behave practiced writing, you are 
<A NAME="202"></A>also prepared to write anything that is required. If you are not, what. 
<A NAME="203"></A>can I now suggest? For if circumstances require something else, what will 
<A NAME="204"></A>you say or what will you do? Remember, then, this general precept and you 
<A NAME="205"></A>will need no suggestion. But if you gape after externals, you must of necessity 
<A NAME="206"></A>ramble up and down in obedience to the will of your master. And who is 
<A NAME="207"></A>the master? He who has the power over the things which you seek to gain 
<A NAME="208"></A>or try to avoid.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="209"></A><B>Chapter 3</B>

<A NAME="210"></A><BR><BR>To those who recommend persons to philosophers
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR>Diogenes said well to one who asked from him letters of recommendation, 
<A NAME="212"></A>"That you are a man he said, "he will know as soon as he sees you; and 
<A NAME="213"></A>he will know whether you are good or bad, if he is by experience skillful 
<A NAME="214"></A>to distinguish the good and the bad; but if he is without experience, he 
<A NAME="215"></A>will never know, if I write to him ten thousand times." For it is just 
<A NAME="216"></A>the same as if a drachma asked to be recommended to a person to be tested. 
<A NAME="217"></A>If he is skillful in testing silver, he will know what you are, for you 
<A NAME="218"></A>will recommend yourself. We ought then in life also to have some skill 
<A NAME="219"></A>as in the case of silver coin that a man may be able to say, like the judge 
<A NAME="220"></A>of silver, "Bring me any drachma and I will test it." But in the case of 
<A NAME="221"></A>syllogisms I would say, "Bring any man that you please, and I will distinguish 
<A NAME="222"></A>for you the man who knows how to resolve syllogisms and the man who does 
<A NAME="223"></A>not." Why? Because I know how to resolve syllogisms. I have the power, 
<A NAME="224"></A>which a man must have who is able to discover those who have the power 
<A NAME="225"></A>of resolving syllogisms. But in life how do I act? At one time I call a 
<A NAME="226"></A>thing good, and at another time bad. What is the reason? The contrary to 
<A NAME="227"></A>that which is in the case of syllogisms, ignorance and 
<A NAME="228"></A>inexperience.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="229"></A><B>Chapter 4</B>

<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR>Against a person who had once been detected in 
<A NAME="231"></A>adultery
<A NAME="232"></A><BR><BR>As Epictetus was saying that man is formed for fidelity, and that 
<A NAME="233"></A>he who subverts fidelity subverts the peculiar characteristic of men, there 
<A NAME="234"></A>entered one of those who are considered to be men of letters, who had once 
<A NAME="235"></A>been detected in adultery in the city. Then Epictetus continued: But if 
<A NAME="236"></A>we lay aside this fidelity for which we are formed and make designs against 
<A NAME="237"></A>our neighbor's wife, what are we are we doing? What else but destroying 
<A NAME="238"></A>and overthrowing? Whom? The man of fidelity, the man of modesty, the man 
<A NAME="239"></A>of sanctity. Is this all? And are we not overthrowing neighbourhood, and 
<A NAME="240"></A>friendship, and the community; and in what place are we putting ourselves? 
<A NAME="241"></A>How shall I consider you, man? As a neighbour, as a friend? What kind of 
<A NAME="242"></A>one? As a citizen? Wherein shall I trust you? So if you were an utensil 
<A NAME="243"></A>so worthless that a man could not use you, you would be pitched out on 
<A NAME="244"></A>the dung heaps, and no man would pick you up. But if, being a man, you 
<A NAME="245"></A>are unable to fill any place which befits a man, what shall we do with 
<A NAME="246"></A>you? For suppose that you cannot hold the place of a friend, can you hold 
<A NAME="247"></A>the place of a slave? And who will trust you? Are you not then content 
<A NAME="248"></A>that you also should be pitched somewhere on a dung heap, as a useless 
<A NAME="249"></A>utensil, and a bit of dung? Then will you say, "No man, cares for me, a 
<A NAME="250"></A>man of letters"? They do not, because you are bad and useless. It is just 
<A NAME="251"></A>as if the wasps complained because no man cares for them, but all fly from 
<A NAME="252"></A>them, and if a man can, he strikes them and knocks them down. You have 
<A NAME="253"></A>such a sting that you throw into trouble and pain any man that you wound 
<A NAME="254"></A>with it. What would you have us do with you? You have no place where you 
<A NAME="255"></A>can be put.
<A NAME="256"></A><BR><BR>"What then, are not women common by nature?" So I say also; for 
<A NAME="257"></A>a little pig is common to all the invited guests, but when the portions 
<A NAME="258"></A>have been distributed, go, if you think it right, and snatch up the portion 
<A NAME="259"></A>of him who reclines next to you, or slyly steal it, or place your hand 
<A NAME="260"></A>down by it and lay hold of it, and if you cannot tear away a bit of the 
<A NAME="261"></A>meat, grease your fingers and lick them. A fine companion over cups, and 
<A NAME="262"></A>Socratic guest indeed! "Well, is not the theatre common to the citizens?" 
<A NAME="263"></A>When then they have taken their seats, come, if you think proper, and eject 
<A NAME="264"></A>one of them. In this way women also are common by nature. When, then, the 
<A NAME="265"></A>legislator, like the master of a feast, has distributed them, will you 
<A NAME="266"></A>not also look for your own portion and not filch and handle what belongs 
<A NAME="267"></A>to another. "But I am a man of letters and understand Archedemus." Understand 
<A NAME="268"></A>Archedemus then, and be an adulterer, and faithless, and instead of a man, 
<A NAME="269"></A>be a wolf or an ape: for what is the difference?
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="270"></A><B>Chapter 5</B>

<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>How magnanimity is consistent with care
<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR>Things themselves are indifferent; but the use of them is not indifferent. 
<A NAME="273"></A>How then shall a man preserve firmness and tranquillity, and at the same 
<A NAME="274"></A>time be careful and neither rash nor negligent? If he imitates those who 
<A NAME="275"></A>play at dice. The counters are indifferent; the dice are indifferent. How 
<A NAME="276"></A>do I know what the cast will be? But to use carefully and dexterously the 
<A NAME="277"></A>cast of the dice, this is my business. Thus in life also the chief business 
<A NAME="278"></A>is this: distinguish and separate things, and say, "Externals are not in 
<A NAME="279"></A>my power: will is in my power. Where shall I seek the good and the bad? 
<A NAME="280"></A>Within, in the things which are my own." But in what does not belong to 
<A NAME="281"></A>you call nothing either good or bad, or profit or damage or anything of 
<A NAME="282"></A>the kind.
<A NAME="283"></A><BR><BR>"What then? Should we use such things carelessly?" In no way: for 
<A NAME="284"></A>this on the other hand is bad for the faculty of the will, and consequently 
<A NAME="285"></A>against nature; but we should act carefully because the use is not indifferent 
<A NAME="286"></A>and we should also act with firmness and freedom from perturbations because 
<A NAME="287"></A>the material is indifferent. For where the material is not indifferent, 
<A NAME="288"></A>there no man can hinder me nor compel me. Where I can be hindered and compelled 
<A NAME="289"></A>the obtaining of those things is not in my power, nor is it good or bad; 
<A NAME="290"></A>but the use is either bad or good, and the use is in my power. But it is 
<A NAME="291"></A>difficult to mingle and to bring together these two things, the carefulness 
<A NAME="292"></A>of him who is affected by the matter and the firmness of him who has no 
<A NAME="293"></A>regard for it; but it is not impossible; and if it is, happiness is impossible. 
<A NAME="294"></A>But we should act as we do in the case of a voyage. What can I do? I can 
<A NAME="295"></A>choose the master of the ship, the sailors, the day, the opportunity. Then 
<A NAME="296"></A>comes a storm. What more have I to care for? for my part is done. The business 
<A NAME="297"></A>belongs to another- the master. But the ship is sinking- what then have 
<A NAME="298"></A>I to do? I do the only things that I can, not to be drowned full of fear, 
<A NAME="299"></A>nor screaming, nor blaming God, but knowing that what has been produced 
<A NAME="300"></A>must also perish: for I am not an immortal being, but a man, a part of 
<A NAME="301"></A>the whole, as an hour is a part of the day: I must be present like the 
<A NAME="302"></A>hour, and past like the hour. What difference, then, does it make to me 
<A NAME="303"></A>how I pass away, whether by being suffocated or by a fever, for I must 
<A NAME="304"></A>pass through some such means?
<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR>This is just what you will see those doing who play at ball skillfully. 
<A NAME="306"></A>No one cares about the ball being good or bad, but about throwing and catching 
<A NAME="307"></A>it. In this therefore is the skill, this the art, the quickness, the judgement, 
<A NAME="308"></A>so that if I spread out my lap I may not be able to catch it, and another, 
<A NAME="309"></A>if I throw, may catch the ball. But if with perturbation and fear we receive 
<A NAME="310"></A>or throw the ball, what kind of play is it then, and wherein shall a man 
<A NAME="311"></A>be steady, and how shall a man see the order in the game? But one will 
<A NAME="312"></A>say, "Throw"; or, "Do not throw"; and another will say, "You have thrown 
<A NAME="313"></A>once." This is quarreling, not play.
<A NAME="314"></A><BR><BR>Socrates, then, knew how to play at ball. How?" By using pleasantry 
<A NAME="315"></A>in the court where he was tried. "Tell me," he says, "Anytus, how do you 
<A NAME="316"></A>say that I do not believe in God. The Demons, who are they, think you? 
<A NAME="317"></A>Are they not sons of Gods, or compounded of gods and men?" When Anytus 
<A NAME="318"></A>admitted this, Socrates said, "Who then, think you, can believe that there 
<A NAME="319"></A>are mules, but not asses"; and this he said as if he were playing at ball. 
<A NAME="320"></A>And what was the ball in that case? Life, chains, banishment, a draught 
<A NAME="321"></A>of poison, separation from wife and leaving children orphans. These were 
<A NAME="322"></A>the things with which he was playing; but still he did play and threw the 
<A NAME="323"></A>ball skillfully. So we should do: we must employ all the care of the players, 
<A NAME="324"></A>but show the same indifference about the ball. For we ought by all means 
<A NAME="325"></A>to apply our art to some external material, not as valuing the material, 
<A NAME="326"></A>but, whatever it may be, showing our art in it. Thus too the weaver does 
<A NAME="327"></A>not make wool, but exercises his art upon such as he receives. Another 
<A NAME="328"></A>gives you food and property and is able to take them away and your poor 
<A NAME="329"></A>body also. When then you have received the material, work on it. If then 
<A NAME="330"></A>you come out without having suffered anything, all who meet you will congratulate 
<A NAME="331"></A>you on your escape; but he who knows how to look at such things, if he 
<A NAME="332"></A>shall see that you have behaved properly in the matter, will commend you 
<A NAME="333"></A>and be pleased with you; and if he shall find that you owe your escape 
<A NAME="334"></A>to any want of proper behavior, he will do the contrary. For where rejoicing 
<A NAME="335"></A>is reasonable, there also is congratulation reasonable.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR><BR>How then is it said that some external things are according to 
<A NAME="337"></A>nature and others contrary to nature? It is said as it might be said if 
<A NAME="338"></A>we were separated from union: for to the foot I shall say that it is according 
<A NAME="339"></A>to nature for it to be clean; but if you take it as a foot and as a thing 
<A NAME="340"></A>not detached, it will befit it both to step into the mud and tread on thorns, 
<A NAME="341"></A>and sometimes to be cut off for the benefit of the whole body; otherwise 
<A NAME="342"></A>it is no longer a foot. We should think in some way about ourselves also. 
<A NAME="343"></A>What are you? A man. If you consider yourself as detached from other men, 
<A NAME="344"></A>it is according to nature to live to old age, to be rich, to be healthy. 
<A NAME="345"></A>But if you consider yourself as a man and a part of a certain whole, it 
<A NAME="346"></A>is for the sake of that whole that at one time you should be sick, at another 
<A NAME="347"></A>time take a voyage and run into danger, and at another time be in want, 
<A NAME="348"></A>and, in some cases, die prematurely. Why then are you troubled? Do you 
<A NAME="349"></A>not know, that as a foot is no longer a foot if it is detached from the 
<A NAME="350"></A>body, so you are no longer a man if you are separated from other men. For 
<A NAME="351"></A>what is a man? A part of a state, of that first which consists of Gods 
<A NAME="352"></A>and of men; then of that which is called next to it, which is a small image 
<A NAME="353"></A>of the universal state. "What then must I be brought to trial; must another 
<A NAME="354"></A>have a fever, another sail on the sea, another die, and another be condemned?" 
<A NAME="355"></A>Yes, for it is impossible in such a body, in such a universe of things, 
<A NAME="356"></A>among so many living together, that such things should not happen, some 
<A NAME="357"></A>to one and others to others. It is your duty then, since you are come here, 
<A NAME="358"></A>to say what you ought, to arrange these things as it is fit. Then some 
<A NAME="359"></A>one says, "I shall charge you with doing me wrong." Much good may it do 
<A NAME="360"></A>you: I have done my part; but whether you also have done yours, you must 
<A NAME="361"></A>look to that; for there is some danger of this too, that it may escape 
<A NAME="362"></A>your notice.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="363"></A><B>Chapter 6</B>

<A NAME="364"></A><BR><BR>Of indifference
<A NAME="365"></A><BR><BR>The hypothetical proposition is indifferent: the judgment about 
<A NAME="366"></A>it is not indifferent, but it is either knowledge or opinion or error. 
<A NAME="367"></A>Thus life is indifferent: the use is not indifferent. When any man then 
<A NAME="368"></A>tells you that these things also are indifferent, do not become negligent; 
<A NAME="369"></A>and when a man invites you to be careful, do not become abject and struck 
<A NAME="370"></A>with admiration of material things. And it is good for you to know your 
<A NAME="371"></A>own preparation and power, that in those matters where you have not been 
<A NAME="372"></A>prepared, you may keep quiet, and not be vexed, if others have the advantage 
<A NAME="373"></A>over you. For you, too, in syllogisms will claim to have the advantage 
<A NAME="374"></A>over them; and if others should be vexed at this, you will console them 
<A NAME="375"></A>by saying, "I have learned them, and you have not." Thus also where there 
<A NAME="376"></A>is need of any practice, seek not that which is required from the need, 
<A NAME="377"></A>but yield in that matter to those who have had practice, and be yourself 
<A NAME="378"></A>content with firmness of mind.
<A NAME="379"></A><BR><BR>Go and salute a certain person. "How?" Not meanly. "But I have 
<A NAME="380"></A>been shut out, for I have not learned to make my way through the window; 
<A NAME="381"></A>and when I have found the door shut, I must either come back or enter through 
<A NAME="382"></A>the window." But still speak to him. "In what way?" Not meanly. But suppose 
<A NAME="383"></A>that you have not got what you wanted. Was this your business, and not 
<A NAME="384"></A>his? Why then do you claim that which belongs to another? Always remember 
<A NAME="385"></A>what is your own, and what belongs to another; and you will not be disturbed. 
<A NAME="386"></A>Chrysippus therefore said well, "So long as future things are uncertain, 
<A NAME="387"></A>I always cling to those which are more adapted to the conservation of that 
<A NAME="388"></A>which is according to nature; for God himself has given me the faculty 
<A NAME="389"></A>of such choice." But if I knew that it was fated for me to be sick, I would 
<A NAME="390"></A>even move toward it; for the foot also, if it had intelligence, would move 
<A NAME="391"></A>to go into the mud. For why are ears of corn produced? Is it not that they 
<A NAME="392"></A>may become dry? And do they not become dry that they may be reaped? for 
<A NAME="393"></A>they are not separated from communion with other things. If then they had 
<A NAME="394"></A>perception, ought they to wish never to be reaped? But this is a curse 
<A NAME="395"></A>upon ears of corn, never to be reaped. So we must know that in the case 
<A NAME="396"></A>of men too it is a curse not to die, just the same as not to be ripened 
<A NAME="397"></A>and not to be reaped. But since we must be reaped, and we also know that 
<A NAME="398"></A>we are reaped, we are vexed at it; for we neither know what we are nor 
<A NAME="399"></A>have we studied what belongs to man, as those who have studied horses know 
<A NAME="400"></A>what belongs to horses. But Chrysantas, when he was going to strike the 
<A NAME="401"></A>enemy, checked himself when he heard the trumpet sounding a retreat: so 
<A NAME="402"></A>it seemed better to him to obey the general's command than to follow his 
<A NAME="403"></A>own inclination. But not one of us chooses, even when necessity summons, 
<A NAME="404"></A>readily to obey it, but weeping and groaning we suffer what we do suffer, 
<A NAME="405"></A>and we call them "circumstances." What kind of circumstances, man? If you 
<A NAME="406"></A>give the name of circumstances to the things which are around you, all 
<A NAME="407"></A>things are circumstances; but if you call hardships by this name, what 
<A NAME="408"></A>hardship is there in the dying of that which has been produced? But that 
<A NAME="409"></A>which destroys is either a sword, or a wheel, or the sea, or a tile, or 
<A NAME="410"></A>a tyrant. Why do you care about the way of going down to Hades? All ways 
<A NAME="411"></A>are equal. But if you will listen to the truth, the way which the tyrant 
<A NAME="412"></A>sends you is shorter. A tyrant never killed a man in six months: but a 
<A NAME="413"></A>fever is often a year about it. All these things are only sound and the 
<A NAME="414"></A>noise of empty names.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR><BR>"I am in danger of my life from Caesar." And am not I in danger 
<A NAME="416"></A>who dwell in Nicopolis, where there are so many earthquakes: and when you 
<A NAME="417"></A>are crossing the Hadriatic, what hazard do you run? Is it not the hazard 
<A NAME="418"></A>of your life? "But I am in danger also as to opinion." Do you mean your 
<A NAME="419"></A>own? how? For who can compel you to have any opinion which you do not choose? 
<A NAME="420"></A>But is it as to another man's opinion? and what kind of danger is yours, 
<A NAME="421"></A>if others have false opinions? "But I am in danger of being banished." 
<A NAME="422"></A>What is it to be banished? To be somewhere else than at Rome? "Yes: what 
<A NAME="423"></A>then if I should be sent to Gyara?" If that suits you, you will go there; 
<A NAME="424"></A>but if it does not, you can go to another place instead of Gyara, whither 
<A NAME="425"></A>he also will go, who sends you to Gyara, whether he choose or not. Why 
<A NAME="426"></A>then do you go up to Rome as if it were something great? It is not worth 
<A NAME="427"></A>all this preparation, that an ingenuous youth should say, "It was not worth 
<A NAME="428"></A>while to have heard so much and to have written so much and to have sat 
<A NAME="429"></A>so long by the side of an old man who is not worth much." Only remember 
<A NAME="430"></A>that division by which your own and not your own are distinguished: never 
<A NAME="431"></A>claim anything which belongs to others. A tribunal and a prison are each 
<A NAME="432"></A>a place, one high and the other low; but the will can be maintained equal, 
<A NAME="433"></A>if you choose to maintain it equal in each. And we shall then be imitators 
<A NAME="434"></A>of Socrates, when we are able to write paeans in prison. But in our present 
<A NAME="435"></A>disposition, consider if we could endure in prison another person saying 
<A NAME="436"></A>to us. "Would you like me to read Paeans to you?" "Why do you trouble me? 
<A NAME="437"></A>do you not know the evils which hold me? Can I in such circumstances?" 
<A NAME="438"></A>What circumstances? "I am going to die." And will other men be 
<A NAME="439"></A>immortal?
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="440"></A><B>Chapter 7</B>

<A NAME="441"></A><BR><BR>How we ought to use divination
<A NAME="442"></A><BR><BR>Through an unreasonable regard to divination many of us omit many 
<A NAME="443"></A>duties. For what more can the diviner see than death or danger or disease, 
<A NAME="444"></A>generally things of that kind? If then I must expose myself to danger for 
<A NAME="445"></A>a friend, and if it is my duty even to die for him, what need have I then 
<A NAME="446"></A>for divination? Have I not within me a diviner who has told me the nature 
<A NAME="447"></A>of good and of evil, and has explained to me the signs of both? What need 
<A NAME="448"></A>have I then to consult the viscera of victims or the flight of birds, and 
<A NAME="449"></A>why do I submit when he says, "It is for your interest"? For does he know 
<A NAME="450"></A>what is for my interest, does he know what is good; and as he has learned 
<A NAME="451"></A>the signs of the viscera, has he also learned the signs of good and evil? 
<A NAME="452"></A>For if he knows the signs of these, he knows the signs both of the beautiful 
<A NAME="453"></A>and of the ugly, and of the just and of the unjust. Do you tell me, man, 
<A NAME="454"></A>what is the thing which is signified for me: is it life or death, poverty 
<A NAME="455"></A>or wealth? But whether these things are for my interest or whether they 
<A NAME="456"></A>are not, I do not intend to ask you. Why don't you give your opinion on 
<A NAME="457"></A>matters of grammar, and why do you give it here about things on which we 
<A NAME="458"></A>are all in error and disputing with one another? The woman, therefore, 
<A NAME="459"></A>who intended to send by a vessel a month's provisions to Gratilla in her 
<A NAME="460"></A>banishment, made a good answer to him who said that Domitian would seize 
<A NAME="461"></A>what she sent. "I would rather," she replied, "that Domitian should seize 
<A NAME="462"></A>all than that I should not send it."
<A NAME="463"></A><BR><BR>What then leads us to frequent use of divination? Cowardice, the 
<A NAME="464"></A>dread of what will happen. This is the reason why we flatter the diviners. 
<A NAME="465"></A>"Pray, master, shall I succeed to the property of my father?" "Let us see: 
<A NAME="466"></A>let us sacrifice on the occasion." "Yes, master, as fortune chooses." When 
<A NAME="467"></A>he has said, "You shall succeed to the inheritance," we thank him as if 
<A NAME="468"></A>we received the inheritance from him. The consequence is that they play 
<A NAME="469"></A>upon us.
<A NAME="470"></A><BR><BR>What then should we do? We ought to come without desire or aversion, 
<A NAME="471"></A>as the wayfarer asks of the man whom he meets which of two roads leads 
<A NAME="472"></A>(to his journey's end), without any desire for that which leads to the 
<A NAME="473"></A>right rather than to the left, for he has no wish to go by any road except 
<A NAME="474"></A>the road which leads (to his end). In the same way ought we to come to 
<A NAME="475"></A>God also as a guide; as we use our eyes, not asking them to show us rather 
<A NAME="476"></A>such things as we wish, but receiving the appearances of things such as 
<A NAME="477"></A>the eyes present them to us. But now we trembling take the augur by the 
<A NAME="478"></A>hand, and, while we invoke God, we entreat the augur, and say, "Master 
<A NAME="479"></A>have mercy on me; suffer me to come safe out of this difficulty." Wretch 
<A NAME="480"></A>would you have, then, anything other than what is best? Is there then anything 
<A NAME="481"></A>better than what pleases God? Why do you, so far as in your power, corrupt 
<A NAME="482"></A>your judge and lead astray your adviser?
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="483"></A><B>Chapter 8</B>

<A NAME="484"></A><BR><BR>What is the nature of the good
<A NAME="485"></A><BR><BR>God is beneficial. But the Good also is beneficial. It is consistent 
<A NAME="486"></A>then that where the nature of God is, there also the nature of the good 
<A NAME="487"></A>should be. What then is the nature of God? Flesh? Certainly not. An estate 
<A NAME="488"></A>in land? By no means. Fame? No. Is it intelligence, knowledge, right reason? 
<A NAME="489"></A>Yes. Herein then simply seek the nature of the good; for I suppose that 
<A NAME="490"></A>you do not seek it in a plant. No. Do you seek it in an irrational animal? 
<A NAME="491"></A>No. If then you seek it in a rational animal, why do you still seek it 
<A NAME="492"></A>anywhere except in the superiority of rational over irrational animals? 
<A NAME="493"></A>Now plants have not even the power of using appearances, and for this reason 
<A NAME="494"></A>you do not apply the term good to them. The good then requires the use 
<A NAME="495"></A>of appearances. Does it require this use only? For if you say that it requires 
<A NAME="496"></A>this use only, say that the good, and that happiness and unhappiness are 
<A NAME="497"></A>in irrational animals also. But you do not say this, and you do right; 
<A NAME="498"></A>for if they possess even in the highest degree the use of appearances, 
<A NAME="499"></A>yet they have not the faculty of understanding the use of appearances; 
<A NAME="500"></A>and there is good reason for this, for they exist for the purpose of serving 
<A NAME="501"></A>others, and they exercise no superiority. For the ass, I suppose, does 
<A NAME="502"></A>not exist for any superiority over others. No; but because we had need 
<A NAME="503"></A>of a back which is able to bear something; and in truth we had need also 
<A NAME="504"></A>of his being able to walk, and for this reason he received also the faculty 
<A NAME="505"></A>of making use of appearances, for otherwise he would not have been able 
<A NAME="506"></A>to walk. And here then the matter stopped. For if he had also received 
<A NAME="507"></A>the faculty of comprehending the use of appearances, it is plain that consistently 
<A NAME="508"></A>with reason he would not then have been subjected to us, nor would he have 
<A NAME="509"></A>done us these services, but he would have been equal to us and like to 
<A NAME="510"></A>us.
<A NAME="511"></A><BR><BR>Will you not then seek the nature of good in the rational animal? 
<A NAME="512"></A>for if it is not there, you not choose to say that it exists in any other 
<A NAME="513"></A>thing. "What then? are not plants and animals also the works of God?" They 
<A NAME="514"></A>are; but they are not superior things, nor yet parts of the Gods. But you 
<A NAME="515"></A>are a superior thing; you are a portion separated from the deity; you have 
<A NAME="516"></A>in yourself a certain portion of him. Why then are you ignorant of your 
<A NAME="517"></A>own noble descent? Why do you not know whence you came? will you not remember 
<A NAME="518"></A>when you are eating, who you are who eat and whom you feed? When you are 
<A NAME="519"></A>in conjunction with a woman, will you not remember who you are who do this 
<A NAME="520"></A>thing? When you are in social intercourse, when you are exercising yourself, 
<A NAME="521"></A>when you are engaged in discussion, know you not that you are nourishing 
<A NAME="522"></A>a god, that you are exercising a god? Wretch, you are carrying about a 
<A NAME="523"></A>god with you, and you know it not. Do you think that I mean some God of 
<A NAME="524"></A>silver or of gold, and external? You carry him within yourself, and you 
<A NAME="525"></A>perceive not that you are polluting him by impure thoughts and dirty deeds. 
<A NAME="526"></A>And if an image of God were present, you would not dare to do any of the 
<A NAME="527"></A>things which you are doing: but when God himself is present within and 
<A NAME="528"></A>sees all and hears all, you are not ashamed of thinking such things and 
<A NAME="529"></A>doing such things, ignorant as you are of your own nature and subject to 
<A NAME="530"></A>the anger of God. Then why do we fear when we are sending a young man from 
<A NAME="531"></A>the school into active life, lest he should do anything improperly, eat 
<A NAME="532"></A>improperly, have improper intercourse with women; and lest the rags in 
<A NAME="533"></A>which he is wrapped should debase him, lest fine garments should make him 
<A NAME="534"></A>proud? This youth does not know his own God: he knows not with whom he 
<A NAME="535"></A>sets out. But can we endure when he says, "I wish I had you with me." Have 
<A NAME="536"></A>you not God with you? and do you seek for any other, when you have him? 
<A NAME="537"></A>or will God tell you anything else than this? If you were a statue of Phidias, 
<A NAME="538"></A>either Athena or Zeus you would think broth of yourself and of the artist, 
<A NAME="539"></A>and if you had any understanding you would try to do nothing unworthy of 
<A NAME="540"></A>him who made you or of yourself, and try not to appear in an unbecoming 
<A NAME="541"></A>dress to those who look on you. But now because Zeus has made you, for 
<A NAME="542"></A>this reason do you care not how you shall appear? And yet is the artist 
<A NAME="543"></A>like the artist in the other? or the work in the one case like the other? 
<A NAME="544"></A>And what work of an artist, for instance, has in itself the faculties, 
<A NAME="545"></A>which the artist shows in making it? Is it not marble or bronze, or gold 
<A NAME="546"></A>or ivory? and the Athena of Phidias when she has once extended the hand 
<A NAME="547"></A>and received in it the figure of Victory stands in that attitude forever. 
<A NAME="548"></A>But the works of God have power of motion, they breathe, they have the 
<A NAME="549"></A>faculty of using the appearances of things, and the power of examining 
<A NAME="550"></A>them. Being the work of such an artist, do you dishonor him? And what shall 
<A NAME="551"></A>I say, not only that he made you, but also intrusted you to yourself and 
<A NAME="552"></A>made you a deposit to yourself? Will you not think of this too, but do 
<A NAME="553"></A>you also dishonor your guardianship? But if God had intrusted an orphan 
<A NAME="554"></A>to you, would you thus neglect him? He has delivered yourself to your care, 
<A NAME="555"></A>and says, "I had no one fitter to intrust him to than yourself: keep him 
<A NAME="556"></A>for me such as he is by nature, modest, faithful, erect, unterrified, free 
<A NAME="557"></A>from passion and perturbation." And then you do not keep him 
<A NAME="558"></A>such.
<A NAME="559"></A><BR><BR>But some will say, "Whence has this fellow got the arrogance which 
<A NAME="560"></A>he displays and these supercilious looks?" I have not yet so much gravity 
<A NAME="561"></A>as befits a philosopher; for I do not yet feel confidence in what I have 
<A NAME="562"></A>learned and what I have assented to: I still fear my own weakness. Let 
<A NAME="563"></A>me get confidence and the, you shall see a countenance such as I ought 
<A NAME="564"></A>to have and an attitude such as I ought to have: then I will show to you 
<A NAME="565"></A>the statue, when it is perfected, when it is polished. What do you expect? 
<A NAME="566"></A>a supercilious countenance? Does the Zeus at Olympia lift up his brow? 
<A NAME="567"></A>No, his look is fixed as becomes him who is ready to 
<A NAME="568"></A>say
<A NAME="569"></A><BR><BR><B>Irrevocable is my word and shall not fail.</B> Such will I show 
<A NAME="570"></A>myself to you, faithful, modest, noble, free from perturbation. "What, 
<A NAME="571"></A>and immortal too, exempt from old age, and from sickness?" No, but dying 
<A NAME="572"></A>as becomes a god, sickening as becomes a god. This power I possess; this 
<A NAME="573"></A>I can do. But the rest I do not possess, nor can I do. I will show the 
<A NAME="574"></A>nerves of a philosopher. "What nerves are these?" A desire never disappointed, 
<A NAME="575"></A>an aversion which never falls on that which it would avoid, a proper pursuit, 
<A NAME="576"></A>a diligent purpose, an assent which is not rash. These you shall 
<A NAME="577"></A>see.

<A NAME="578"></A><B>Chapter 9</B>

<A NAME="579"></A><BR><BR>That when we cannot fulfill that which the character of a man promises, 
<A NAME="580"></A>we assume the character of a philosopher
<A NAME="581"></A><BR><BR>It is no common thing to do this only, to fulfill the promise of 
<A NAME="582"></A>a man's nature. For what is a man? The answer is: "A rational and mortal 
<A NAME="583"></A>being." Then, by the rational faculty, from whom are we separated? From 
<A NAME="584"></A>wild beasts. And from what others? From sheep and like animals. Take care 
<A NAME="585"></A>then to do nothing like a wild beast; but if you do, you have lost the 
<A NAME="586"></A>character of a man; you have not fulfilled your promise. See that you do 
<A NAME="587"></A>nothing like a sheep; but if you do, in this case the man is lost. What 
<A NAME="588"></A>then do we do as sheep? When we act gluttonously, when we act lewdly, when 
<A NAME="589"></A>we act rashly, filthily, inconsiderately, to what have we declined? To 
<A NAME="590"></A>sheep. What have we lost? The rational faculty. When we act contentiously 
<A NAME="591"></A>and harmfully and passionately, and violently, to what have we declined? 
<A NAME="592"></A>To wild beasts. Consequently some of us are great wild beasts, and others 
<A NAME="593"></A>little beasts, of a bad disposition and small, whence we may say, "Let 
<A NAME="594"></A>me be eaten by a lion." But in all these ways the promise of a man acting 
<A NAME="595"></A>as a man is destroyed. For when is a conjunctive proposition maintained? 
<A NAME="596"></A>When it fulfills what its nature promises; so that the preservation of 
<A NAME="597"></A>a complex proposition is when it is a conjunction of truths. When is a 
<A NAME="598"></A>disjunctive maintained? When it fulfills what it promises. When are flutes, 
<A NAME="599"></A>a lyre, a horse, a dog, preserved? What is the wonder then if man also 
<A NAME="600"></A>in like manner is preserved, and in like manner is lost? Each man is improved 
<A NAME="601"></A>and preserved by corresponding acts, the carpenter by acts of carpentry, 
<A NAME="602"></A>the grammarian by acts of grammar. But if a man accustoms himself to write 
<A NAME="603"></A>ungrammatically, of necessity his art will be corrupted and destroyed. 
<A NAME="604"></A>Thus modest actions preserve the modest man, and immodest actions destroy 
<A NAME="605"></A>him: and actions of fidelity preserve the faithful man, and the contrary 
<A NAME="606"></A>actions destroy him. And on the other hand contrary actions strengthen 
<A NAME="607"></A>contrary characters: shamelessness strengthens the shameless man, faithlessness 
<A NAME="608"></A>the faithless man, abusive words the abusive man, anger the man of an angry 
<A NAME="609"></A>temper, and unequal receiving and giving make the avaricious man more 
<A NAME="610"></A>avaricious.
<A NAME="611"></A><BR><BR>For this reason philosophers admonish us not to be satisfied with 
<A NAME="612"></A>learning only, but also to add study, and then practice. For we have long 
<A NAME="613"></A>been accustomed to do contrary things, and we put in practice opinions 
<A NAME="614"></A>which are contrary to true opinions. If then we shall not also put in practice 
<A NAME="615"></A>right opinions, we shall be nothing more than the expositors of the opinions 
<A NAME="616"></A>of others. For now who among us is not able to discuss according to the 
<A NAME="617"></A>rules of art about good and evil things? "That of things some are good, 
<A NAME="618"></A>and some are bad, and some are indifferent: the good then are virtues, 
<A NAME="619"></A>and the things which participate in virtues; and the are the contrary; 
<A NAME="620"></A>and the indifferent are wealth, health, reputation." Then, if in the midst 
<A NAME="621"></A>of our talk there should happen some greater noise than usual, or some 
<A NAME="622"></A>of those who are present should laugh at us, we are disturbed. Philosopher, 
<A NAME="623"></A>where are the things which you were talking about? Whence did you produce 
<A NAME="624"></A>and utter them? From the lips, and thence only. Why then do you corrupt 
<A NAME="625"></A>the aids provided by others? Why do you treat the weightiest matters as 
<A NAME="626"></A>if you were playing a game of dice? For it is one thing to lay up bread 
<A NAME="627"></A>and wine as in a storehouse, and another thing to eat. That which has been 
<A NAME="628"></A>eaten, is digested, distributed, and is become sinews, flesh, bones, blood, 
<A NAME="629"></A>healthy colour, healthy breath. Whatever is stored up, when you choose 
<A NAME="630"></A>you can readily take and show it; but you have no other advantage from 
<A NAME="631"></A>it except so far as to appear to possess it. For what is the difference 
<A NAME="632"></A>between explaining these doctrines and those of men who have different 
<A NAME="633"></A>opinions? Sit down now and explain according to the rules of art the opinions 
<A NAME="634"></A>of Epicurus, and perhaps you will explain his opinions in a more useful 
<A NAME="635"></A>manner than Epicurus himself. Why then do you call yourself a Stoic? Why 
<A NAME="636"></A>do you deceive the many? Why do you deceive the many? Why do you act the 
<A NAME="637"></A>part of a Jew, when you are a Greek? Do you not see how each is called 
<A NAME="638"></A>a Jew, or a Syrian or an Egyptian? and when we see a man inclining to two 
<A NAME="639"></A>sides, we are accustomed to say, "This man is not a Jew, but he acts as 
<A NAME="640"></A>one." But when he has assumed the affects of one who has been imbued with 
<A NAME="641"></A>Jewish doctrine and has adopted that sect, then he is in fact and he is 
<A NAME="642"></A>named a Jew. Thus we too being falsely imbued, are in name Jews, but in 
<A NAME="643"></A>fact we are something else. Our affects are inconsistent with our words; 
<A NAME="644"></A>we are far from practicing what we say, and that of which we are proud, 
<A NAME="645"></A>as if we knew it. Thus being, unable to fulfill even what the character 
<A NAME="646"></A>of a man promises, we even add to it the profession of a philosopher, which 
<A NAME="647"></A>is as heavy a burden, as if a man who is unable to bear ten pounds should 
<A NAME="648"></A>attempt to raise the stone which Ajax lifted.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="649"></A><B>Chapter 10</B>

<A NAME="650"></A><BR><BR>How we may discover the duties of life from 
<A NAME="651"></A>names
<A NAME="652"></A><BR><BR>Consider who you are. In the first place, you are a man; and this 
<A NAME="653"></A>is one who has nothing superior to the faculty of the will, but all other 
<A NAME="654"></A>things subjected to it; and the faculty itself he possesses unenslaved 
<A NAME="655"></A>and free from subjection. Consider then from what things you have been 
<A NAME="656"></A>separated by reason. You have been separated from wild beasts: you have 
<A NAME="657"></A>been separated from domestic animals. Further, you are a citizen of the 
<A NAME="658"></A>world, and a part of it, not one of the subservient, but one of the principal 
<A NAME="659"></A>parts, for you are capable of comprehending the divine administration and 
<A NAME="660"></A>of considering the connection of things. What then does the character of 
<A NAME="661"></A>a citizen promise? To hold nothing as profitable to himself; to deliberate 
<A NAME="662"></A>about nothing as if he were detached from the community, but to act as 
<A NAME="663"></A>the hand or foot would do, if they had reason and understood the constitution 
<A NAME="664"></A>of nature, for they would never put themselves in motion nor desire anything, 
<A NAME="665"></A>otherwise than with reference to the whole. Therefore the philosophers 
<A NAME="666"></A>say well, that if the good man had foreknowledge of what would happen, 
<A NAME="667"></A>he would cooperate toward his own sickness and death and mutilation, since 
<A NAME="668"></A>he knows that these things are assigned to him according to the universal 
<A NAME="669"></A>arrangement, and that the whole is superior to the part and the state to 
<A NAME="670"></A>the citizen. But now, because we do not know the future, it is our duty 
<A NAME="671"></A>to stick to the things which are in their nature more suitable for our 
<A NAME="672"></A>choice, for we were made among other things for this.
<A NAME="673"></A><BR><BR>After this, remember that you are a son. What does this character 
<A NAME="674"></A>promise? To consider that everything which is the son's belongs to the 
<A NAME="675"></A>father, to obey him in all things, never to blame him to another, nor to 
<A NAME="676"></A>say or do anything which does him injury, to yield to him in all things 
<A NAME="677"></A>and give way, cooperating with him as far as you can. After this know that 
<A NAME="678"></A>you are a brother also, and that to this character it is due to make concessions; 
<A NAME="679"></A>to be easily persuaded, to speak good of your brother, never to claim in 
<A NAME="680"></A>opposition to him any of the things which are independent of the will, 
<A NAME="681"></A>but readily to give them up, that you may have the larger share in what 
<A NAME="682"></A>is dependent on the will. For see what a thing it is, in place of a lettuce, 
<A NAME="683"></A>if it should so happen, or a seat, to gain for yourself goodness of disposition. 
<A NAME="684"></A>How great is the advantage.
<A NAME="685"></A><BR><BR>Next to this, if you are senator of any state, remember that you 
<A NAME="686"></A>are a senator: if a youth, that you are a youth: if an old man, that you 
<A NAME="687"></A>are an old man; for each of such names, if it comes to be examined, marks 
<A NAME="688"></A>out the proper duties. But if you go and blame your brother, I say to you, 
<A NAME="689"></A>"You have forgotten who you are and what is your name." In the next place, 
<A NAME="690"></A>if you were a smith and made a wrong use of the hammer, you would have 
<A NAME="691"></A>forgotten the smith; and if you have forgotten the brother and instead 
<A NAME="692"></A>of a brother have become an enemy, would you appear not to have changed 
<A NAME="693"></A>one thing for another in that case? And if instead of a man, who is a tame 
<A NAME="694"></A>animal and social, you are become a mischievous wild beast, treacherous, 
<A NAME="695"></A>and biting, have you lost nothing? But, you must lose a bit of money that 
<A NAME="696"></A>you may suffer damage? And does the loss of nothing else do a man damage? 
<A NAME="697"></A>If you had lost the art of grammar or music, would you think the loss of 
<A NAME="698"></A>it a damage? and if you shall lose modesty, moderation and gentleness, 
<A NAME="699"></A>do you think the loss nothing? And yet the things first mentioned are lost 
<A NAME="700"></A>by some cause external and independent of the will, and the second by our 
<A NAME="701"></A>own fault; and as to the first neither to have them nor to lose them is 
<A NAME="702"></A>shameful; but as to the second, not to have them and to lose them is shameful 
<A NAME="703"></A>and matter of reproach and a misfortune. What does the pathic lose? He 
<A NAME="704"></A>loses the man. What does he lose who makes the pathic what he is? Many 
<A NAME="705"></A>other things; and he also loses the man no less than the other. What does 
<A NAME="706"></A>he lose who commits adultery? He loses the modest, the temperate, the decent, 
<A NAME="707"></A>the citizen, the neighbour. What does he lose who is angry? Something else. 
<A NAME="708"></A>What does the coward lose? Something else. No man is bad without suffering 
<A NAME="709"></A>some loss and damage. If then you look for the damage in the loss of money 
<A NAME="710"></A>only, all these men receive no harm or damage; it may be, they have even 
<A NAME="711"></A>profit and gain, when they acquire a bit of money by any of these deeds. 
<A NAME="712"></A>But consider that if you refer everything to a small coin, not even he 
<A NAME="713"></A>who loses his nose is in your opinion damaged. "Yes," you say, "for he 
<A NAME="714"></A>is mutilated in his body." Well; but does he who has lost his smell only 
<A NAME="715"></A>lose nothing? Is there, then, no energy of the soul which is an advantage 
<A NAME="716"></A>to him who possesses it, and a damage to him who has lost it? "Tell me 
<A NAME="717"></A>what sort you mean." Have we not a natural modesty? "We have." Does he 
<A NAME="718"></A>who loses this sustain no damage? is he deprived of nothing, does he part 
<A NAME="719"></A>with nothing of the things which belong to him? Have we not naturally fidelity? 
<A NAME="720"></A>natural affection, a natural disposition to help others, a natural disposition 
<A NAME="721"></A>to forbearance? The man then who allows himself to be damaged in these 
<A NAME="722"></A>matters, can he be free from harm and uninjured? "What then? shall I not 
<A NAME="723"></A>hurt him, who has hurt me?" In the first place consider what hurt is, and 
<A NAME="724"></A>remember what you have heard from the philosophers. For if the good consists 
<A NAME="725"></A>in the will, and the evil also in the will, see if what you say is not 
<A NAME="726"></A>this: "What then, since that man has hurt himself by doing an unjust act 
<A NAME="727"></A>to me, shall I not hurt myself by doing some unjust act to him?" Why do 
<A NAME="728"></A>we not imagine to something of this kind? But where there is any detriment 
<A NAME="729"></A>to the body or to our possession, there is harm there; and where the same 
<A NAME="730"></A>thing happens to the faculty of the will, there is no harm; for he who 
<A NAME="731"></A>has been deceived or he who has done an unjust act neither suffers in the 
<A NAME="732"></A>head nor in the eye nor in the hip, nor does he lose his estate; and we 
<A NAME="733"></A>wish for nothing else than these things. But whether we shall have the 
<A NAME="734"></A>will modest and faithful or shameless and faithless, we care not the least, 
<A NAME="735"></A>except only in the school so far as a few words are concerned. Therefore 
<A NAME="736"></A>our proficiency is limited to these few words; but beyond them it does 
<A NAME="737"></A>not exist even in the slightest degree.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="738"></A><B>Chapter 11</B>

<A NAME="739"></A><BR><BR>What the beginning of philosophy is
<A NAME="740"></A><BR><BR>The beginning of philosophy to him at least who enters on it in 
<A NAME="741"></A>the right way and by the door, is a consciousness of his own weakness and 
<A NAME="742"></A>inability about necessary things. For we come into the world with no natural 
<A NAME="743"></A>notion of a right-angled triangle, or of a diesis, or of a half tone; but 
<A NAME="744"></A>we learn each of these things by a certain transmission according to art; 
<A NAME="745"></A>and for this reason those who do not know them, do not think that they 
<A NAME="746"></A>know them. But as to good and evil, and beautiful and ugly, and becoming 
<A NAME="747"></A>and unbecoming, and happiness and misfortune, and proper and improper, 
<A NAME="748"></A>and what we ought to do and what we ought not to do, whoever came into 
<A NAME="749"></A>the world without having an innate idea of them? Wherefore we all use these 
<A NAME="750"></A>names, and we endeavor to fit the preconceptions to the several cases thus: 
<A NAME="751"></A>"He has done well, he has not done well; he has done as he ought, not as 
<A NAME="752"></A>he ought; he has been unfortunate, he has been fortunate; he is unjust, 
<A NAME="753"></A>he is just": who does not use these names? who among us defers the use 
<A NAME="754"></A>of them till he has learned them, as he defers the use of the words about 
<A NAME="755"></A>lines or sounds? And the cause of this is that we come into the world already 
<A NAME="756"></A>taught as it were by nature some things on this matter, and proceeding 
<A NAME="757"></A>from these we have added to them self-conceit. "For why," a man says, "do 
<A NAME="758"></A>I not know the beautiful and the ugly? Have I not the notion of it?" You 
<A NAME="759"></A>have. "Do I not adapt it to particulars?" You do. "Do I not then adapt 
<A NAME="760"></A>it properly?" In that lies the whole question; and conceit is added here. 
<A NAME="761"></A>For, beginning from these things which are admitted, men proceed to that 
<A NAME="762"></A>which is matter of dispute by means of unsuitable adaptation; for if they 
<A NAME="763"></A>possessed this power of adaptation in addition to those things, what would 
<A NAME="764"></A>hinder them from being perfect? But now since you think that you properly 
<A NAME="765"></A>adapt the preconceptions to the particulars, tell me whence you derive 
<A NAME="766"></A>this. Because I think so. But it does not seem so to another, and he thinks 
<A NAME="767"></A>that he also makes a proper adaptation; or does he not think so? He does 
<A NAME="768"></A>think so. Is it possible then that both of you can properly apply the preconceptions 
<A NAME="769"></A>to things about which you have contrary opinions? It is not possible. Can 
<A NAME="770"></A>you then show us anything better toward adapting the preconceptions beyond 
<A NAME="771"></A>your thinking that you do? Does the madman do any other things than the 
<A NAME="772"></A>things as in which seem to him right? Is then this criterion for him also? 
<A NAME="773"></A>It is not sufficient. Come then to something which is superior to seeming. 
<A NAME="774"></A>What is this?
<A NAME="775"></A><BR><BR>Observe, this is the beginning of philosophy, a perception of the 
<A NAME="776"></A>disagreement of men with one another, and an inquiry into the cause of 
<A NAME="777"></A>the disagreement, and a condemnation and distrust of that which only "seems," 
<A NAME="778"></A>and a certain investigation of that which "seems" whether it "seems" rightly, 
<A NAME="779"></A>and a discovery of some rule, as we have discovered a balance in the determination 
<A NAME="780"></A>of weights, and a carpenter's rule in the case of straight and crooked 
<A NAME="781"></A>things. This is the beginning of philosophy. "Must we say that all thins 
<A NAME="782"></A>are right which seem so to all?" And how is it possible that contradictions 
<A NAME="783"></A>can be right? "Not all then, but all which seem to us to be right." How 
<A NAME="784"></A>more to you than those which seem right to the Syrians? why more than what 
<A NAME="785"></A>seem right to the Egyptians? why more than what seems right to me or to 
<A NAME="786"></A>any other man? "Not at all more." What then "seems" to every man is not 
<A NAME="787"></A>sufficient for determining what "is"; for neither in the case of weights 
<A NAME="788"></A>or measures are we satisfied with the bare appearance, but in each case 
<A NAME="789"></A>we have discovered a certain rule. In this matter then is there no rule 
<A NAME="790"></A>certain to what "seems?" And how is it possible that the most necessary 
<A NAME="791"></A>things among men should have no sign, and be incapable of being discovered? 
<A NAME="792"></A>There is then some rule. And why then do we not seek the rule and discover 
<A NAME="793"></A>it, and afterward use it without varying from it, not even stretching out 
<A NAME="794"></A>the finger without it? For this, I think, is that which when it is discovered 
<A NAME="795"></A>cures of their madness those who use mere "seeming" as a measure, and misuse 
<A NAME="796"></A>it; so that for the future proceeding from certain things known and made 
<A NAME="797"></A>clear we may use in the case of particular things the preconceptions which 
<A NAME="798"></A>are distinctly fixed.
<A NAME="799"></A><BR><BR>What is the matter presented to us about which we are inquiring? 
<A NAME="800"></A>"Pleasure." Subject it to the rule, throw it into the balance. Ought the 
<A NAME="801"></A>good to be such a thing that it is fit that we have confidence in it? "Yes." 
<A NAME="802"></A>And in which we ought to confide? "It ought to be." Is it fit to trust 
<A NAME="803"></A>to anything which is insecure? "No." Is then pleasure anything secure? 
<A NAME="804"></A>"No." Take it then and throw it out of the scale, and drive it far away 
<A NAME="805"></A>from the place of good things. But if you are not sharp-sighted, and one 
<A NAME="806"></A>balance is not enough for you, bring another. Is it fit to be elated over 
<A NAME="807"></A>what is good? "Yes." Is it proper then to be elated over present pleasure? 
<A NAME="808"></A>See that you do not say that it is proper; but if you do, I shall then 
<A NAME="809"></A>not think you are worthy even of the balance. Thus things are tested and 
<A NAME="810"></A>weighed when the rules are ready. And to philosophize is this, to examine 
<A NAME="811"></A>and confirm the rules; and then to use them when they are known is the 
<A NAME="812"></A>act of a wise and good man.

<A NAME="813"></A><B>Chapter 12</B>

<A NAME="814"></A><BR><BR>Of disputation or discussion
<A NAME="815"></A><BR><BR>What things a man must learn in order to be able to apply the art 
<A NAME="816"></A>of disputation, has been accurately shown by our philosophers; but with 
<A NAME="817"></A>respect to the proper use of the things, we are entirely without practice. 
<A NAME="818"></A>Only give to any of us, whom you please, an illiterate man to discuss with,, 
<A NAME="819"></A>and he cannot discover how to deal with the man. But when he has moved 
<A NAME="820"></A>the man a little, if he answers beside the purpose, he does not know how 
<A NAME="821"></A>to treat him, but he then either abuses or ridicules him, and says, "He 
<A NAME="822"></A>is an illiterate man; it is not possible to do anything with him." Now 
<A NAME="823"></A>a guide, when he has found a man out of the road leads him into the right 
<A NAME="824"></A>way: he does not ridicule or abuse him and then leave him. Do you also 
<A NAME="825"></A>show this illiterate man the truth, and you will see that he follows. But 
<A NAME="826"></A>so long as you do not show him the truth, do not ridicule him, but rather 
<A NAME="827"></A>feel your own incapacity.
<A NAME="828"></A><BR><BR>How then did Socrates act? He used to compel his adversary in disputation 
<A NAME="829"></A>to bear testimony to him, and he wanted no other witness. Therefore he 
<A NAME="830"></A>could say, "I care not for other witnesses, but I am always satisfied with 
<A NAME="831"></A>the evidence of my adversary, and I do not ask the opinion of others, but 
<A NAME="832"></A>only the opinion of him who is disputing with me." For he used to make 
<A NAME="833"></A>the conclusions drawn from natural notions so plain that every man saw 
<A NAME="834"></A>the contradiction and withdrew from it: "Does the envious man rejoice?" 
<A NAME="835"></A>"By no means, but he is rather pained." Well, "Do you think that envy is 
<A NAME="836"></A>pain over evils? and what envy is there of evils?" Therefore he made his 
<A NAME="837"></A>adversary say that envy is pain over good things. "Well then, would any 
<A NAME="838"></A>man envy those who are nothing to him?" "By no means." Thus having completed 
<A NAME="839"></A>the notion and distinctly fixed it he would go away without saying to his 
<A NAME="840"></A>adversary, "Define to me envy"; and if the adversary had defined envy, 
<A NAME="841"></A>he did not say, "You have defined it badly, for the terms of the definition 
<A NAME="842"></A>do not correspond to the thing defined." These are technical terms, and 
<A NAME="843"></A>for this reason disagreeable and hardly intelligible to illiterate men, 
<A NAME="844"></A>which terms we cannot lay aside. But that the illiterate man himself, who 
<A NAME="845"></A>follows the appearances presented to him, should be able to concede anything 
<A NAME="846"></A>or reject it, we can never by the use of these terms move him to do. Accordingly, 
<A NAME="847"></A>being conscious of our own inability, we do not attempt the thing; at least 
<A NAME="848"></A>such of us as have any caution do not. But the greater part and the rash, 
<A NAME="849"></A>when they enter into such disputations, confuse themselves and confuse 
<A NAME="850"></A>others; and finally abusing their adversaries and abused by them, they 
<A NAME="851"></A>walk away.
<A NAME="852"></A><BR><BR>Now this was the first and chief peculiarity of Socrates, never 
<A NAME="853"></A>to be irritated in argument, never to utter anything abusive, anything 
<A NAME="854"></A>insulting, but to bear with abusive persons and to put an end to the quarrel. 
<A NAME="855"></A>If you would know what great power he had in this way, read the Symposium 
<A NAME="856"></A>of Xenophon, and you will see how many quarrels he put an end to. Hence 
<A NAME="857"></A>with good reason in the poets also this power is most highly 
<A NAME="858"></A>praised,
<A NAME="859"></A><BR><BR><B>Quickly with the skill he settles great disputes.</B>
<A NAME="860"></A><BR><BR>Well then; the matter is not now very safe, and particularly at 
<A NAME="861"></A>Rome; for he who attempts to do it, must not do it in a corner, you may 
<A NAME="862"></A>be sure, but must go to a man of consular rank, if it so happen, or to 
<A NAME="863"></A>a rich man, and ask him, "Can you tell me, Sir, to whose care you have 
<A NAME="864"></A>entrusted your horses?" "I can tell you." Here you entrusted them to a 
<A NAME="865"></A>person indifferently and to one who has no experience of horses? "By no 
<A NAME="866"></A>means." Well then; can you tell me to whom you entrust your gold or silver 
<A NAME="867"></A>things or your vestments? "I don't entrust even these to anyone indifferently." 
<A NAME="868"></A>Well; your own body, have you already considered about entrusting the care 
<A NAME="869"></A>of it to any person? "Certainly." To a man of experience, I suppose, and 
<A NAME="870"></A>one acquainted with the aliptic, or with the healing art? "Without a doubt." 
<A NAME="871"></A>Are these the best things that you have, or do you also possess something 
<A NAME="872"></A>else which is better than all these? "What kind of thing do you mean?" 
<A NAME="873"></A>That I mean which makes use of these things, and tests each of these things 
<A NAME="874"></A>and deliberates. "Is it the soul that you mean?" You think right, for it 
<A NAME="875"></A>is the soul that I mean. "In truth I do think the soul is a much better 
<A NAME="876"></A>thing than all the others which I possess." Can you then show us in what 
<A NAME="877"></A>way you have taken care of the soul? for it is not likely that you, who 
<A NAME="878"></A>are so wise a man and have a reputation in the city, inconsiderately and 
<A NAME="879"></A>carelessly allow the most valuable thing that you possess to be neglected 
<A NAME="880"></A>and to perish? "Certainly not." But have you taken care of the soul yourself; 
<A NAME="881"></A>and have you learned from another to do this, or have you discovered the 
<A NAME="882"></A>means yourself? Here comes the danger that in the first place he may say, 
<A NAME="883"></A>"What is this to you, my good man, who are you?" Next, if you persist in 
<A NAME="884"></A>troubling him, there is a danger that he may raise his hands and give you 
<A NAME="885"></A>blows. I was once myself also an admirer of this mode of instruction until 
<A NAME="886"></A>I fell into these dangers.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="887"></A><B>Chapter 13</B>

<A NAME="888"></A><BR><BR>On anxiety
<A NAME="889"></A><BR><BR>When I see a man anxious, I say, "What does this man want? If he 
<A NAME="890"></A>did not want something which is not in his power, how could he be anxious?" 
<A NAME="891"></A>For this reason a lute player when he is singing by himself has no anxiety, 
<A NAME="892"></A>but when he enters the theatre, he is anxious even if he has a good voice 
<A NAME="893"></A>and plays well on the lute; for he not only wishes to sing well, but also 
<A NAME="894"></A>to obtain applause: but this is not in his power. Accordingly, where he 
<A NAME="895"></A>has skill, there he has confidence. Bring any single person who knows nothing 
<A NAME="896"></A>of music, and the musician does not care for him. But in the matter where 
<A NAME="897"></A>a man knows nothing and has not been practiced, there he is anxious. What 
<A NAME="898"></A>matter is this? He knows not what a crowd is or what the praise of a crowd 
<A NAME="899"></A>is. However he has learned to strike the lowest chord and the highest; 
<A NAME="900"></A>but what the praise of the many is, and what power it has in life he neither 
<A NAME="901"></A>knows nor has he thought about it. Hence he must of necessity tremble and 
<A NAME="902"></A>grow pale. I cannot then say that a man is not a lute player when I see 
<A NAME="903"></A>him afraid, but I can say something else, and not one thing, but many. 
<A NAME="904"></A>And first of all I call him a stranger and say, "This man does not know 
<A NAME="905"></A>in what part of the world he is, but though he has been here so long, he 
<A NAME="906"></A>is ignorant of the laws of the State and the customs, and what is permitted 
<A NAME="907"></A>and what is not; and he has never employed any lawyer to tell him and to 
<A NAME="908"></A>explain the laws." But a man does not write a will, if he does not does 
<A NAME="909"></A>not know how it ought to be written, or he employs a person who does know; 
<A NAME="910"></A>nor does he rashly seal a bond or write a security. But he uses his desire 
<A NAME="911"></A>without a lawyer's advice, and aversion, and pursuit, and attempt and purpose. 
<A NAME="912"></A>"How do you mean without a lawyer?" He does not know that he wills what 
<A NAME="913"></A>is not allowed, and does not will that which is of necessity; and he does 
<A NAME="914"></A>not know either what is his own or what is or what is another man's; but 
<A NAME="915"></A>if he did know, he could never be impeded, he would never be hindered, 
<A NAME="916"></A>he would not be anxious. "How so?" Is any man then afraid about things 
<A NAME="917"></A>which are not evil? "No." Is he afraid about things which are evils, but 
<A NAME="918"></A>still so far within his power that they may not happen? "Certainly he is 
<A NAME="919"></A>not." If, then, the things which are independent of the will are neither 
<A NAME="920"></A>good nor bad, and all things which do depend on the will are within our 
<A NAME="921"></A>power, and no man can either take them from us or give them to us, if we 
<A NAME="922"></A>do not choose, where is room left for anxiety? But we are anxious about 
<A NAME="923"></A>our poor body, our little property, about the will of Caesar; but not anxious 
<A NAME="924"></A>about things internal. Are we anxious about not forming a false opinion? 
<A NAME="925"></A>No, for this is in my power. About not exerting our movements contrary 
<A NAME="926"></A>to nature? No, not even about this. When then you see a man pale, as the 
<A NAME="927"></A>physician says, judging from the complexion, this man's spleen is disordered, 
<A NAME="928"></A>that man's liver; so also say, this man's desire and aversion are disordered, 
<A NAME="929"></A>he is not in the right way, he is in a fever. For nothing else changes 
<A NAME="930"></A>the color, or causes trembling or chattering of the teeth, or causes a 
<A NAME="931"></A>man to
<A NAME="932"></A><BR><BR><B>Sink in his knees and shift from foot to 
<A NAME="933"></A>foot.</B>
<A NAME="934"></A><BR><BR>For this reason when Zeno was going to meet Antigonus, he was not 
<A NAME="935"></A>anxious, for Antigonus had no power over any of the things which Zeno admired; 
<A NAME="936"></A>and Zeno did not care for those things over which Antigonus had power. 
<A NAME="937"></A>But Antigonus was anxious when he was going to meet Zeno, for he wished 
<A NAME="938"></A>to please Zeno; but this was a thing external. But Zeno did not want to 
<A NAME="939"></A>please Antigonus; for no man who is skilled in any art wishes to please 
<A NAME="940"></A>one who has no such skill.
<A NAME="941"></A><BR><BR>Should I try to please you? Why? I suppose, you know the measure 
<A NAME="942"></A>by which one man is estimated by another. Have you taken pains to learn 
<A NAME="943"></A>what is a good man and what is a bad man, and how a man becomes one or 
<A NAME="944"></A>the other? Why, then, are you not good yourself? "How," he replies, "am 
<A NAME="945"></A>I not good?" Because no good man laments or roans or weeps, no good man 
<A NAME="946"></A>is pale and trembles, or says, "How will he receive me, how will he listen 
<A NAME="947"></A>to me?" Slave, just as it pleases him. Why do you care about what belongs 
<A NAME="948"></A>to others? Is it now his fault if he receives badly what proceeds from 
<A NAME="949"></A>you? "Certainly." And is it possible that a fault should be one man's, 
<A NAME="950"></A>and the evil in another? "No." Why then are you anxious about that which 
<A NAME="951"></A>belongs to others? "Your question is reasonable; but I am anxious how I 
<A NAME="952"></A>shall speak to him." Cannot you then speak to him as you choose? "But I 
<A NAME="953"></A>fear that I may be disconcerted?" If you are going to write the name of 
<A NAME="954"></A>Dion, are you afraid that you would be disconcerted? "By no means." Why? 
<A NAME="955"></A>is it not because you have practiced writing the name? "Certainly." Well, 
<A NAME="956"></A>if you were going to read the name, would you not feel the same? and why? 
<A NAME="957"></A>Because every art has a certain strength and confidence in the things which 
<A NAME="958"></A>belong to it. Have you then not practiced speaking? and what else did you 
<A NAME="959"></A>learn in the school? Syllogisms and sophistical propositions? For what 
<A NAME="960"></A>purpose? was it not for the purpose of discoursing skillfully? and is not 
<A NAME="961"></A>discoursing skillfully the same as discoursing seasonably and cautiously 
<A NAME="962"></A>and with intelligence, and also without making mistakes and without hindrance, 
<A NAME="963"></A>and besides all this with confidence? "Yes." When, then, you are mounted 
<A NAME="964"></A>on a horse and go into a plain, are you anxious at being matched against 
<A NAME="965"></A>a man who is on foot, and anxious in a matter in which you are practiced, 
<A NAME="966"></A>and he is not? "Yes, but that person has power to kill me." Speak the truth 
<A NAME="967"></A>then, unhappy man, and do not brag, nor claim to be a philosopher, nor 
<A NAME="968"></A>refuse to acknowledge your masters, but so long as you present this handle 
<A NAME="969"></A>in your body, follow every man who is stronger than yourself. Socrates 
<A NAME="970"></A>used to practice speaking, he who talked as he did to the tyrants, to the 
<A NAME="971"></A>dicasts, he who talked in his prison. Diogenes had practiced speaking, 
<A NAME="972"></A>he who spoke as he did to Alexander, to the pirates, to the person who 
<A NAME="973"></A>bought him. These men were confident in the things which they practiced. 
<A NAME="974"></A>But do you walk off to your own affairs and never leave them: go and sit 
<A NAME="975"></A>in a corner, and weave syllogisms, and propose them to another. There is 
<A NAME="976"></A>not in you the man who can rule a state.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="977"></A><B>Chapter 14</B>

<A NAME="978"></A><BR><BR>To Naso
<A NAME="979"></A><BR><BR>When a certain Roman entered with his son and listened to one reading, 
<A NAME="980"></A>Epictetus said, "This is the method of instruction"; and he stopped. When 
<A NAME="981"></A>the Roman asked him to go on, Epictetus said: Every art, when it is taught, 
<A NAME="982"></A>causes labour to him who is unacquainted with it and is unskilled in it, 
<A NAME="983"></A>and indeed the things which proceed from the arts immediately show their 
<A NAME="984"></A>use in the purpose for which they were made; and most of them contain something 
<A NAME="985"></A>attractive and pleasing. For indeed to be present and to observe how a 
<A NAME="986"></A>shoemaker learns is not a pleasant thing; but the shoe is useful and also 
<A NAME="987"></A>not disagreeable to look at. And the discipline of a smith when he is learning 
<A NAME="988"></A>is very disagreeable to one who chances to be present and is a stranger 
<A NAME="989"></A>to the art: but the work shows the use of the art. But you will see this 
<A NAME="990"></A>much more in music; for if you are present while a person is learning, 
<A NAME="991"></A>the discipline will appear most disagreeable; and yet the results of music 
<A NAME="992"></A>are pleasing and delightful to those who know nothing of music. And here 
<A NAME="993"></A>we conceive the work of a philosopher to be something of this kind: he 
<A NAME="994"></A>must adapt his wish to what is going on, so that neither any of the things 
<A NAME="995"></A>which are taking place shall take place contrary to our wish, nor any of 
<A NAME="996"></A>the things which do not take place shall not take place when we wish that 
<A NAME="997"></A>they should. From this the result is to those who have so arranged the 
<A NAME="998"></A>work of philosophy, not to fall in the desire, nor to fall in with that 
<A NAME="999"></A>which they would avoid; without uneasiness, without fear, without perturbation 
<A NAME="1000"></A>to pass through life themselves, together with their associates maintaining 
<A NAME="1001"></A>the relations both natural and acquired, as the relation of son, of father, 
<A NAME="1002"></A>of brother, of citizen, of man, of wife, of neighbour, of fellow-traveler, 
<A NAME="1003"></A>of ruler, of ruled. The work of a philosopher we conceive to be something 
<A NAME="1004"></A>like this. It remains next to inquire how this must be 
<A NAME="1005"></A>accomplished.
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR><BR>We see then that the carpenter when he has learned certain things 
<A NAME="1007"></A>becomes a carpenter; the pilot by learning certain things becomes a pilot. 
<A NAME="1008"></A>May it not, then, in philosophy also not be sufficient to wish to be wise 
<A NAME="1009"></A>and good, and that there is also a necessity to learn certain things? We 
<A NAME="1010"></A>inquire then what these things are. The philosophers say that we ought 
<A NAME="1011"></A>first to learn that there is a God and that he provides for all things; 
<A NAME="1012"></A>also that it is not possible to conceal from him our acts, or even our 
<A NAME="1013"></A>intentions and thoughts. The next thing, is to learn what is the nature 
<A NAME="1014"></A>of the Gods; for such as they are discovered to be, he, who would please 
<A NAME="1015"></A>and obey them, must try with all his power to be like them. If the divine 
<A NAME="1016"></A>is faithful, man also must be faithful; if it is free, man also must be 
<A NAME="1017"></A>free; if beneficent, man also must be beneficent; if magnanimous, man also 
<A NAME="1018"></A>must be magnanimous; as being, then an imitator of God, he must do and 
<A NAME="1019"></A>say everything consistently with this fact.
<A NAME="1020"></A><BR><BR>"With what then must we begin?" If you will enter on the discussion, 
<A NAME="1021"></A>I will tell you that you must first understand names. "So, then, you say 
<A NAME="1022"></A>that I do not now understand names?" You do not understand them. "How, 
<A NAME="1023"></A>then, do I use them?" Just as the illiterate use written language, as cattle 
<A NAME="1024"></A>use appearances: for use is one thing, understanding is another. But if 
<A NAME="1025"></A>you think that you understand them, produce whatever word you please, and 
<A NAME="1026"></A>let us try whether we understand it. But it is a disagreeable thing for 
<A NAME="1027"></A>a man to be confuted who is now old and, it may be, has now served his 
<A NAME="1028"></A>three campaigns. I too know this: for now you are come to me as if you 
<A NAME="1029"></A>were in want of nothing: and what could you even imagine to be wanting 
<A NAME="1030"></A>to you? You are rich, you have children, and a wife, perhaps and many slaves: 
<A NAME="1031"></A>Caesar knows you, in Rome you have many friends, you render their dues 
<A NAME="1032"></A>to all, you know how to requite him who does you a favour, and to repay 
<A NAME="1033"></A>in the same kind him who does a wrong. What do you lack? If, then, I shall 
<A NAME="1034"></A>show you that you lack the things most necessary and the chief things for 
<A NAME="1035"></A>happiness, and that hitherto you have looked after everything rather than 
<A NAME="1036"></A>what you ought, and, to crown all, that you neither know what God is nor 
<A NAME="1037"></A>what man is, nor what is good nor what is bad; and as to what I have said 
<A NAME="1038"></A>about your ignorance of other matters, that may perhaps be endured, but 
<A NAME="1039"></A>if I say that you know nothing about yourself, how is it possible that 
<A NAME="1040"></A>you should endure me and bear the proof and stay here? It is not possible; 
<A NAME="1041"></A>but you immediately go off in bad humour. And yet what harm have I done 
<A NAME="1042"></A>you? unless the mirror also injures the ugly man because it shows him to 
<A NAME="1043"></A>himself such as he is; unless the physician also is supposed to insult 
<A NAME="1044"></A>the sick man, when he says to him, "Man, do you think that you ail nothing? 
<A NAME="1045"></A>But you have a fever: go without food to-day; drink water." And no one 
<A NAME="1046"></A>says, "What an insult!" But if you say to a man, "Your desires are inflamed, 
<A NAME="1047"></A>your aversions are low, your intentions are inconsistent, your pursuits 
<A NAME="1048"></A>are not comfortable to nature, your opinions are rash and false," the man 
<A NAME="1049"></A>immediately goes away and says, "he has insulted me."
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR><BR>Our way of dealing is like that of a crowded assembly. Beasts are 
<A NAME="1051"></A>brought to be sold and oxen; and the greater part of the men come to buy 
<A NAME="1052"></A>and sell, and there are some few who come to look at the market and to 
<A NAME="1053"></A>inquire how it is carried on, and why, and who fixes the meeting and for 
<A NAME="1054"></A>what purpose. So it is here also in this assembly: some like cattle trouble 
<A NAME="1055"></A>themselves about nothing except their fodder. For to all of you who are 
<A NAME="1056"></A>busy about possessions and lands and slaves and magisterial offices, these 
<A NAME="1057"></A>are nothing except fodder. But there are a few who attend the assembly, 
<A NAME="1058"></A>men who love to look on and consider what is the world, who governs it. 
<A NAME="1059"></A>Has it no governor? And how is it possible that a city or a family cannot 
<A NAME="1060"></A>continue to exist, not even the shortest time without an administrator 
<A NAME="1061"></A>and guardian, and that so great and beautiful a system should be administered 
<A NAME="1062"></A>with such order and yet without a purpose and by chance? There is then 
<A NAME="1063"></A>an administrator. What kind of administrator and how does he govern? And 
<A NAME="1064"></A>who are we, who were produced by him, and for what purpose? Have we some 
<A NAME="1065"></A>connection with him and some relation toward him, or none? This is the 
<A NAME="1066"></A>way in which these few are affected, and then they apply themselves only 
<A NAME="1067"></A>to this one thing, to examine the meeting and then to go away. What then? 
<A NAME="1068"></A>They are ridiculed by the many, as the spectators at the fair are by the 
<A NAME="1069"></A>traders; and if the beasts had any understanding, they would ridicule those

<A NAME="1074"></A><BR><BR>When some persons have heard these words, that a man ought to be
