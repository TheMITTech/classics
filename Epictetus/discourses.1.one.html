<A NAME="10"></A><B>Chapter 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Of the things which are in our Power, and not in our 
<A NAME="12"></A>Power
<A NAME="13"></A><BR><BR>Of all the faculties, you will find not one which is capable of 
<A NAME="14"></A>contemplating itself; and, consequently, not capable either of approving 
<A NAME="15"></A>or disapproving. How far does the grammatic art possess the contemplating 
<A NAME="16"></A>power? As far as forming a judgement about what is written and spoken. 
<A NAME="17"></A>And how far music? As far as judging about melody. Does either of them 
<A NAME="18"></A>then contemplate itself? By no means. But when you must write something 
<A NAME="19"></A>to your friend, grammar will tell you what words you must write; but whether 
<A NAME="20"></A>you should write or not, grammar will not tell you. And so it is with music 
<A NAME="21"></A>as to musical sounds; but whether you should sing at the present time and 
<A NAME="22"></A>play on the lute, or do neither, music will not tell you. What faculty 
<A NAME="23"></A>then will tell you? That which contemplates both itself and all other things. 
<A NAME="24"></A>And what is this faculty? The rational faculty; for this is the only faculty 
<A NAME="25"></A>that we have received which examines itself, what it is, and what power 
<A NAME="26"></A>it has, and what is the value of this gift, and examines all other faculties: 
<A NAME="27"></A>for what else is there which tells us that golden things are beautiful, 
<A NAME="28"></A>for they do not say so themselves? Evidently it is the faculty which is 
<A NAME="29"></A>capable of judging of appearances. What else judges of music, grammar, 
<A NAME="30"></A>and other faculties, proves their uses and points out the occasions for 
<A NAME="31"></A>using them? Nothing else.
<A NAME="32"></A><BR><BR>As then it was fit to be so, that which is best of all and supreme 
<A NAME="33"></A>over all is the only thing which the gods have placed in our power, the 
<A NAME="34"></A>right use of appearances; but all other things they have not placed in 
<A NAME="35"></A>our power. Was it because they did not choose? I indeed think that, if 
<A NAME="36"></A>they had been able, they would have put these other things also in our 
<A NAME="37"></A>power, but they certainly could not. For as we exist on the earth, and 
<A NAME="38"></A>are bound to such a body and to such companions, how was it possible for 
<A NAME="39"></A>us not to be hindered as to these things by externals?
<A NAME="40"></A><BR><BR>But what says Zeus? "Epictetus, if it were possible, I would have 
<A NAME="41"></A>made both your little body and your little property free and not exposed 
<A NAME="42"></A>to hindrance. But now be not ignorant of this: this body is not yours, 
<A NAME="43"></A>but it is clay finely tempered. And since I was not able to do for you 
<A NAME="44"></A>what I have mentioned, I have given you a small portion of us, this faculty 
<A NAME="45"></A>of pursuing an object and avoiding it, and the faculty of desire and aversion, 
<A NAME="46"></A>and, in a word, the faculty of using the appearances of things; and if 
<A NAME="47"></A>you will take care of this faculty and consider it your only possession, 
<A NAME="48"></A>you will never be hindered, never meet with impediments; you will not lament, 
<A NAME="49"></A>you will not blame, you will not flatter any person."
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR>"Well, do these seem to you small matters?" I hope not. "Be content 
<A NAME="51"></A>with them then and pray to the gods." But now when it is in our power to 
<A NAME="52"></A>look after one thing, and to attach ourselves to it, we prefer to look 
<A NAME="53"></A>after many things, and to be bound to many things, to the body and to property, 
<A NAME="54"></A>and to brother and to friend, and to child and to slave. Since, then, we 
<A NAME="55"></A>are bound to many things, we are depressed by them and dragged down. For 
<A NAME="56"></A>this reason, when the weather is not fit for sailing, we sit down and torment 
<A NAME="57"></A>ourselves, and continually look out to see what wind is blowing. "It is 
<A NAME="58"></A>north." What is that to us? "When will the west wind blow?" When it shall 
<A NAME="59"></A>choose, my good man, or when it shall please AEolus; for God has not made 
<A NAME="60"></A>you the manager of the winds, but AEolus. What then? We must make the best 
<A NAME="61"></A>use that we can of the things which are in our power, and use the rest 
<A NAME="62"></A>according to their nature. What is their nature then? As God may 
<A NAME="63"></A>please.
<A NAME="64"></A><BR><BR>"Must I, then, alone have my head cut off?" What, would you have 
<A NAME="65"></A>all men lose their heads that you may be consoled? Will you not stretch 
<A NAME="66"></A>out your neck as Lateranus did at Rome when Nero ordered him to be beheaded? 
<A NAME="67"></A>For when he had stretched out his neck, and received a feeble blow, which 
<A NAME="68"></A>made him draw it in for a moment, he stretched it out again. And a little 
<A NAME="69"></A>before, when he was visited by Epaphroditus, Nero's freedman, who asked 
<A NAME="70"></A>him about the cause of offense which he had given, he said, "If I choose 
<A NAME="71"></A>to tell anything, I will tell your master."
<A NAME="72"></A><BR><BR>What then should a man have in readiness in such circumstances? 
<A NAME="73"></A>What else than "What is mine, and what is not mine; and permitted to me, 
<A NAME="74"></A>and what is not permitted to me." I must die. Must I then die lamenting? 
<A NAME="75"></A>I must be put in chains. Must I then also lament? I must go into exile. 
<A NAME="76"></A>Does any man then hinder me from going with smiles and cheerfulness and 
<A NAME="77"></A>contentment? "Tell me the secret which you possess." I will not, for this 
<A NAME="78"></A>is in my power. "But I will put you in chains." Man, what are you talking 
<A NAME="79"></A>about? Me in chains? You may fetter my leg, but my will not even Zeus himself 
<A NAME="80"></A>can overpower. "I will throw you into prison." My poor body, you mean. 
<A NAME="81"></A>"I will cut your head off." When, then, have I told you that my head alone 
<A NAME="82"></A>cannot be cut off? These are the things which philosophers should meditate 
<A NAME="83"></A>on, which they should write daily, in which they should exercise 
<A NAME="84"></A>themselves.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>Thrasea used to say, "I would rather be killed to-day than banished 
<A NAME="86"></A>to-morrow." What, then, did Rufus say to him? "If you choose death as the 
<A NAME="87"></A>heavier misfortune, how great is the folly of your choice? But if, as the 
<A NAME="88"></A>lighter, who has given you the choice? Will you not study to be content 
<A NAME="89"></A>with that which has been given to you?"
<A NAME="90"></A><BR><BR>What, then, did Agrippinus say? He said, "I am not a hindrance 
<A NAME="91"></A>to myself." When it was reported to him that his trial was going on in 
<A NAME="92"></A>the Senate, he said, "I hope it may turn out well; but it is the fifth 
<A NAME="93"></A>hour of the day"- this was the time when he was used to exercise himself 
<A NAME="94"></A>and then take the cold bath- "let us go and take our exercise." After he 
<A NAME="95"></A>had taken his exercise, one comes and tells him, "You have been condemned." 
<A NAME="96"></A>"To banishment," he replies, "or to death?" "To banishment." "What about 
<A NAME="97"></A>my property?" "It is not taken from you." "Let us go to Aricia then," he 
<A NAME="98"></A>said, "and dine."
<A NAME="99"></A><BR><BR>This it is to have studied what a man ought to study; to have made 
<A NAME="100"></A>desire, aversion, free from hindrance, and free from all that a man would 
<A NAME="101"></A>avoid. I must die. If now, I am ready to die. If, after a short time, I 
<A NAME="102"></A>now dine because it is the dinner-hour; after this I will then die. How? 
<A NAME="103"></A>Like a man who gives up what belongs to another.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="104"></A><B>Chapter 2</B>

<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR>How a Man on every occasion can maintain his Proper 
<A NAME="106"></A>Character
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR>To the rational animal only is the irrational intolerable; but 
<A NAME="108"></A>that which is rational is tolerable. Blows are not naturally intolerable. 
<A NAME="109"></A>"How is that?" See how the Lacedaemonians endure whipping when they have 
<A NAME="110"></A>learned that whipping is consistent with reason. "To hang yourself is not 
<A NAME="111"></A>intolerable." When, then, you have the opinion that it is rational, you 
<A NAME="112"></A>go and hang yourself. In short, if we observe, we shall find that the animal 
<A NAME="113"></A>man is pained by nothing so much as by that which is irrational; and, on 
<A NAME="114"></A>the contrary, attracted to nothing so much as to that which is 
<A NAME="115"></A>rational.
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR>But the rational and the irrational appear such in a different 
<A NAME="117"></A>way to different persons, just as the good and the bad, the profitable 
<A NAME="118"></A>and the unprofitable. For this reason, particularly, we need discipline, 
<A NAME="119"></A>in order to learn how to adapt the preconception of the rational and the 
<A NAME="120"></A>irrational to the several things conformably to nature. But in order to 
<A NAME="121"></A>determine the rational and the irrational, we use not only the of external 
<A NAME="122"></A>things, but we consider also what is appropriate to each person. For to 
<A NAME="123"></A>one man it is consistent with reason to hold a chamber pot for another, 
<A NAME="124"></A>and to look to this only, that if he does not hold it, he will receive 
<A NAME="125"></A>stripes, and he will not receive his food: but if he shall hold the pot, 
<A NAME="126"></A>he will not suffer anything hard or disagreeable. But to another man not 
<A NAME="127"></A>only does the holding of a chamber pot appear intolerable for himself, 
<A NAME="128"></A>but intolerable also for him to allow another to do this office for him. 
<A NAME="129"></A>If, then, you ask me whether you should hold the chamber pot or not, I 
<A NAME="130"></A>shall say to you that the receiving of food is worth more than the not 
<A NAME="131"></A>receiving of it, and the being scourged is a greater indignity than not 
<A NAME="132"></A>being scourged; so that if you measure your interests by these things, 
<A NAME="133"></A>go and hold the chamber pot. "But this," you say, "would not be worthy 
<A NAME="134"></A>of me." Well, then, it is you who must introduce this consideration into 
<A NAME="135"></A>the inquiry, not I; for it is you who know yourself, how much you are worth 
<A NAME="136"></A>to yourself, and at what price you sell yourself; for men sell themselves 
<A NAME="137"></A>at various prices.
<A NAME="138"></A><BR><BR>For this reason, when Florus was deliberating whether he should 
<A NAME="139"></A>go down to Nero's spectacles and also perform in them himself, Agrippinus 
<A NAME="140"></A>said to him, "Go down": and when Florus asked Agrippinus, "Why do not you 
<A NAME="141"></A>go down?" Agrippinus replied, "Because I do not even deliberate about the 
<A NAME="142"></A>matter." For he who has once brought himself to deliberate about such matters, 
<A NAME="143"></A>and to calculate the value of external things, comes very near to those 
<A NAME="144"></A>who have forgotten their own character. For why do you ask me the question, 
<A NAME="145"></A>whether death is preferable or life? I say "life." "Pain or pleasure?" 
<A NAME="146"></A>I say "pleasure." But if I do not take a part in the tragic acting, I shall 
<A NAME="147"></A>have my head struck off. Go then and take a part, but I will not. "Why?" 
<A NAME="148"></A>Because you consider yourself to be only one thread of those which are 
<A NAME="149"></A>in the tunic. Well then it was fitting for you to take care how you should 
<A NAME="150"></A>be like the rest of men, just as the thread has no design to be anything 
<A NAME="151"></A>superior to the other threads. But I wish to be purple, that small part 
<A NAME="152"></A>which is bright, and makes all the rest appear graceful and beautiful. 
<A NAME="153"></A>Why then do you tell me to make myself like the many? and if I do, how 
<A NAME="154"></A>shall I still be purple?
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR>Priscus Helvidius also saw this, and acted conformably. For when 
<A NAME="156"></A>Vespasian sent and commanded him not to go into the senate, he replied, 
<A NAME="157"></A>"It is in your power not to allow me to be a member of the senate, but 
<A NAME="158"></A>so long as I am, I must go in." "Well, go in then," says the emperor, "but 
<A NAME="159"></A>say nothing." "Do not ask my opinion, and I will be silent." "But I must 
<A NAME="160"></A>ask your opinion." "And I must say what I think right." "But if you do, 
<A NAME="161"></A>I shall put you to death." "When then did I tell you that I am immortal? 
<A NAME="162"></A>You will do your part, and I will do mine: it is your part to kill; it 
<A NAME="163"></A>is mine to die, but not in fear: yours to banish me; mine to depart without 
<A NAME="164"></A>sorrow."
<A NAME="165"></A><BR><BR>What good then did Priscus do, who was only a single person? And 
<A NAME="166"></A>what good does the purple do for the toga? Why, what else than this, that 
<A NAME="167"></A>it is conspicuous in the toga as purple, and is displayed also as a fine 
<A NAME="168"></A>example to all other things? But in such circumstances another would have 
<A NAME="169"></A>replied to Caesar who forbade him to enter the senate, "I thank you for 
<A NAME="170"></A>sparing me." But such a man Vespasian would not even have forbidden to 
<A NAME="171"></A>enter the senate, for he knew that he would either sit there like an earthen 
<A NAME="172"></A>vessel, or, if he spoke, he would say what Caesar wished, and add even 
<A NAME="173"></A>more.
<A NAME="174"></A><BR><BR>In this way an athlete also acted who was in danger of dying unless 
<A NAME="175"></A>his private parts were amputated. His brother came to the athlete, who 
<A NAME="176"></A>was a philosopher, and said, "Come, brother, what are you going to do? 
<A NAME="177"></A>Shall we amputate this member and return to the gymnasium?" But the athlete 
<A NAME="178"></A>persisted in his resolution and died. When some one asked Epictetus how 
<A NAME="179"></A>he did this, as an athlete or a philosopher, "As a man," Epictetus replied, 
<A NAME="180"></A>"and a man who had been proclaimed among the athletes at the Olympic games 
<A NAME="181"></A>and had contended in them, a man who had been familiar with such a place, 
<A NAME="182"></A>and not merely anointed in Baton's school. Another would have allowed even 
<A NAME="183"></A>his head to be cut off, if he could have lived without it. Such is that 
<A NAME="184"></A>regard to character which is so strong in those who have been accustomed 
<A NAME="185"></A>to introduce it of themselves and conjoined with other things into their 
<A NAME="186"></A>deliberations."
<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR>"Come, then, Epictetus, shave yourself." "If I am a philosopher," 
<A NAME="188"></A>I answer, "I will not shave myself." "But I will take off your head?" If 
<A NAME="189"></A>that will do you any good, take it off.
<A NAME="190"></A><BR><BR>Some person asked, "How then shall every man among us perceive 
<A NAME="191"></A>what is suitable to his character?" How, he replied, does the bull alone, 
<A NAME="192"></A>when the lion has attacked, discover his own powers and put himself forward 
<A NAME="193"></A>in defense of the whole herd? It is plain that with the powers the perception 
<A NAME="194"></A>of having them is immediately conjoined; and, therefore, whoever of us 
<A NAME="195"></A>has such powers will not be ignorant of them. Now a bull is not made suddenly, 
<A NAME="196"></A>nor a brave man; but we must discipline ourselves in the winter for the 
<A NAME="197"></A>summer campaign, and not rashly run upon that which does not concern 
<A NAME="198"></A>us.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR>Only consider at what price you sell your own will; if for no other 
<A NAME="200"></A>reason, at least for this, that you sell it not for a small sum. But that 
<A NAME="201"></A>which is great and superior perhaps belongs to Socrates and such as are 
<A NAME="202"></A>like him. "Why then, if we are naturally such, are not a very great number 
<A NAME="203"></A>of us like him?" Is it true then that all horses become swift, that all 
<A NAME="204"></A>dogs are skilled in tracking footprints? "What, then, since I am naturally 
<A NAME="205"></A>dull, shall I, for this reason, take no pains?" I hope not. Epictetus is 
<A NAME="206"></A>not superior to Socrates; but if he is not inferior, this is enough for 
<A NAME="207"></A>me; for I shall never be a Milo, and yet I do not neglect my body; nor 
<A NAME="208"></A>shall I be a Croesus, and yet I do not neglect my property; nor, in a word, 
<A NAME="209"></A>do we neglect looking after anything because we despair of reaching the 
<A NAME="210"></A>highest degree.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="211"></A><B>Chapter 3</B>

<A NAME="212"></A><BR><BR>How a man should proceed from the principle of God being the father 
<A NAME="213"></A>of all men to the rest
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR>If a man should be able to assent to this doctrine as he ought, 
<A NAME="215"></A>that we are all sprung from God in an especial manner, and that God is 
<A NAME="216"></A>the father both of men and of gods, I suppose that he would never have 
<A NAME="217"></A>any ignoble or mean thoughts about himself. But if Caesar should adopt 
<A NAME="218"></A>you, no one could endure your arrogance; and if you know that you are the 
<A NAME="219"></A>son of Zeus, will you not be elated? Yet we do not so; but since these 
<A NAME="220"></A>two things are mingled in the generation of man, body in common with the 
<A NAME="221"></A>animals, and reason and intelligence in common with the gods, many incline 
<A NAME="222"></A>to this kinship, which is miserable and mortal; and some few to that which 
<A NAME="223"></A>is divine and happy. Since then it is of necessity that every man uses 
<A NAME="224"></A>everything according to the opinion which he has about it, those, the few, 
<A NAME="225"></A>who think that they are formed for fidelity and modesty and a sure use 
<A NAME="226"></A>of appearances have no mean or ignoble thoughts about themselves; but with 
<A NAME="227"></A>the many it is quite the contrary. For they say, "What am I? A poor, miserable 
<A NAME="228"></A>man, with my wretched bit of flesh." Wretched. Indeed; but you possess 
<A NAME="229"></A>something better than your "bit of flesh." Why then do you neglect that 
<A NAME="230"></A>which is better, and why do you attach yourself to this?
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR>Through this kinship with the flesh, some of us inclining to it 
<A NAME="232"></A>become like wolves, faithless and treacherous and mischievous: some become 
<A NAME="233"></A>like lions, savage and untamed; but the greater part of us become foxes 
<A NAME="234"></A>and other worse animals. For what else is a slanderer and a malignant man 
<A NAME="235"></A>than a fox, or some other more wretched and meaner animal? See, then, and 
<A NAME="236"></A>take care that you do not become some one of these miserable 
<A NAME="237"></A>things.

<A NAME="238"></A><B>Chapter 4</B>

<A NAME="239"></A><BR><BR>Of progress or improvement
<A NAME="240"></A><BR><BR>He who is making progress, having learned from philosophers that 
<A NAME="241"></A>desire means the desire of good things, and aversion means aversion from 
<A NAME="242"></A>bad things; having learned too that happiness and tranquillity are not 
<A NAME="243"></A>attainable by man otherwise than by not failing to obtain what he desires, 
<A NAME="244"></A>and not falling into that which he would avoid; such a man takes from himself 
<A NAME="245"></A>desire altogether and defers it, but he employs his aversion only on things 
<A NAME="246"></A>which are dependent on his will. For if he attempts to avoid anything independent 
<A NAME="247"></A>of his will, he knows that sometimes he will fall in with something which 
<A NAME="248"></A>he wishes to avoid, and he will be unhappy. Now if virtue promises good 
<A NAME="249"></A>fortune and tranquillity and happiness, certainly also the progress toward 
<A NAME="250"></A>virtue is progress toward each of these things. For it is always true that 
<A NAME="251"></A>to whatever point the perfecting of anything leads us, progress is an approach 
<A NAME="252"></A>toward this point.
<A NAME="253"></A><BR><BR>How then do we admit that virtue is such as I have said, and yet 
<A NAME="254"></A>seek progress in other things and make a display of it? What is the product 
<A NAME="255"></A>of virtue? Tranquillity. Who then makes improvement? It is he who has read 
<A NAME="256"></A>many books of Chrysippus? But does virtue consist in having understood 
<A NAME="257"></A>Chrysippus? If this is so, progress is clearly nothing else than knowing 
<A NAME="258"></A>a great deal of Chrysippus. But now we admit that virtue produces one thing. 
<A NAME="259"></A>and we declare that approaching near to it is another thing, namely, progress 
<A NAME="260"></A>or improvement. "Such a person," says one, "is already able to read Chrysippus 
<A NAME="261"></A>by himself." Indeed, sir, you are making great progress. What kind of progress? 
<A NAME="262"></A>But why do you mock the man? Why do you draw him away from the perception 
<A NAME="263"></A>of his own misfortunes? Will you not show him the effect of virtue that 
<A NAME="264"></A>he may learn where to look for improvement? Seek it there, wretch, where 
<A NAME="265"></A>your work lies. And where is your work? In desire and in aversion, that 
<A NAME="266"></A>you may not be disappointed in your desire, and that you may not fall into 
<A NAME="267"></A>that which you would avoid; in your pursuit and avoiding, that you commit 
<A NAME="268"></A>no error; in assent and suspension of assent, that you be not deceived. 
<A NAME="269"></A>The first things, and the most necessary, are those which I have named. 
<A NAME="270"></A>But if with trembling and lamentation you seek not to fall into that which 
<A NAME="271"></A>you avoid, tell me how you are improving.
<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR>Do you then show me your improvement in these things? If I were 
<A NAME="273"></A>talking to an athlete, I should say, "Show me your shoulders"; and then 
<A NAME="274"></A>he might say, "Here are my halteres." You and your halteres look to that. 
<A NAME="275"></A>I should reply, "I wish to see the effect of the halteres." So, when you 
<A NAME="276"></A>say: "Take the treatise on the active powers, and see how I have studied 
<A NAME="277"></A>it." I reply, "Slave, I am not inquiring about this, but how you exercise 
<A NAME="278"></A>pursuit and avoidance, desire and aversion, how your design and purpose 
<A NAME="279"></A>and prepare yourself, whether conformably to nature or not. If conformably, 
<A NAME="280"></A>give me evidence of it, and I will say that you are making progress: but 
<A NAME="281"></A>if not conformably, be gone, and not only expound your books, but write 
<A NAME="282"></A>such books yourself; and what will you gain by it? Do you not know that 
<A NAME="283"></A>the whole book costs only five denarii? Does then the expounder seem to 
<A NAME="284"></A>be worth more than five denarii? Never, then, look for the matter itself 
<A NAME="285"></A>in one place, and progress toward it in another."
<A NAME="286"></A><BR><BR>Where then is progress? If any of you, withdrawing himself from 
<A NAME="287"></A>externals, turns to his own will to exercise it and to improve it by labour, 
<A NAME="288"></A>so as to make it conformable to nature, elevated, free, unrestrained, unimpeded, 
<A NAME="289"></A>faithful, modest; and if he has learned that he who desires or avoids the 
<A NAME="290"></A>things which are not in his power can neither be faithful nor free, but 
<A NAME="291"></A>of necessity he must change with them and be tossed about with them as 
<A NAME="292"></A>in a tempest, and of necessity must subject himself to others who have 
<A NAME="293"></A>the power to procure or prevent what he desires or would avoid; finally, 
<A NAME="294"></A>when he rises in the morning, if he observes and keeps these rules, bathes 
<A NAME="295"></A>as a man of fidelity, eats as a modest man; in like manner, if in every 
<A NAME="296"></A>matter that occurs he works out his chief principles as the runner does 
<A NAME="297"></A>with reference to running, and the trainer of the voice with reference 
<A NAME="298"></A>to the voice- this is the man who truly makes progress, and this is the 
<A NAME="299"></A>man who has not traveled in vain. But if he has strained his efforts to 
<A NAME="300"></A>the practice of reading books, and labours only at this, and has traveled 
<A NAME="301"></A>for this, I tell him to return home immediately, and not to neglect his 
<A NAME="302"></A>affairs there; for this for which he has traveled is nothing. But the other 
<A NAME="303"></A>thing is something, to study how a man can rid his life of lamentation 
<A NAME="304"></A>and groaning, and saying, "Woe to me," and "wretched that I am," and to 
<A NAME="305"></A>rid it also of misfortune and disappointment and to learn what death is, 
<A NAME="306"></A>and exile, and prison, and poison, that he may be able to say when he is 
<A NAME="307"></A>in fetters, "Dear Crito, if it is the will of the gods that it be so, let 
<A NAME="308"></A>it be so"; and not to say, "Wretched am I, an old man; have I kept my gray 
<A NAME="309"></A>hairs for this?" Who is it that speaks thus? Do you think that I shall 
<A NAME="310"></A>name some man of no repute and of low condition? Does not Priam say this? 
<A NAME="311"></A>Does not OEdipus say this? Nay, all kings say it! For what else is tragedy 
<A NAME="312"></A>than the perturbations of men who value externals exhibited in this kind 
<A NAME="313"></A>of poetry? But if a man must learn by fiction that no external things which 
<A NAME="314"></A>are independent of the will concern us, for this? part I should like this 
<A NAME="315"></A>fiction, by the aid of which I should live happily and undisturbed. But 
<A NAME="316"></A>you must consider for yourselves what you wish.
<A NAME="317"></A><BR><BR>What then does Chrysippus teach us? The reply is, "to know that 
<A NAME="318"></A>these things are not false, from which happiness comes and tranquillity 
<A NAME="319"></A>arises. Take my books, and you will learn how true and conformable to nature 
<A NAME="320"></A>are the things which make me free from perturbations." O great good fortune! 
<A NAME="321"></A>O the great benefactor who points out the way! To Triptolemus all men have 
<A NAME="322"></A>erected temples and altars, because he gave us food by cultivation; but 
<A NAME="323"></A>to him who discovered truth and brought it to light and communicated it 
<A NAME="324"></A>to all, not the truth which shows us how to live, but how to live well, 
<A NAME="325"></A>who of you for this reason has built an altar, or a temple, or has dedicated 
<A NAME="326"></A>a statue, or who worships God for this? Because the gods have given the 
<A NAME="327"></A>vine, or wheat, we sacrifice to them: but because they have produced in 
<A NAME="328"></A>the human mind that fruit by which they designed to show us the truth which 
<A NAME="329"></A>relates to happiness, shall we not thank God for this?
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="330"></A><B>Chapter 5</B>

<A NAME="331"></A><BR><BR>Against the academics
<A NAME="332"></A><BR><BR>If a man, said Epictetus, opposes evident truths, it is not easy 
<A NAME="333"></A>to find arguments by which we shall make him change his opinion. But this 
<A NAME="334"></A>does not arise either from the man's strength or the teacher's weakness; 
<A NAME="335"></A>for when the man, though he has been confuted, is hardened like a stone, 
<A NAME="336"></A>how shall we then be able to deal with him by argument?
<A NAME="337"></A><BR><BR>Now there are two kinds of hardening, one of the understanding, 
<A NAME="338"></A>the other of the sense of shame, when a man is resolved not to assent to 
<A NAME="339"></A>what is manifest nor to desist from contradictions. Most of us are afraid 
<A NAME="340"></A>of mortification of the body, and would contrive all means to avoid such 
<A NAME="341"></A>a thing, but we care not about the soul's mortification. And indeed with 
<A NAME="342"></A>regard to the soul, if a man be in such a state as not to apprehend anything, 
<A NAME="343"></A>or understand at all, we think that he is in a bad condition: but if the 
<A NAME="344"></A>sense of shame and modesty are deadened, this we call even 
<A NAME="345"></A>power.
<A NAME="346"></A><BR><BR>Do you comprehend that you are awake? "I do not," the man replies, 
<A NAME="347"></A>"for I do not even comprehend when in my sleep I imagine that I am awake." 
<A NAME="348"></A>Does this appearance then not differ from the other? "Not at all," he replies. 
<A NAME="349"></A>Shall I still argue with this man? And what fire or what iron shall I apply 
<A NAME="350"></A>to him to make him feel that he is deadened? He does perceive, but he pretends 
<A NAME="351"></A>that he does not. He's even worse than a dead man. He does not see the 
<A NAME="352"></A>contradiction: he is in a bad condition. Another does see it, but he is 
<A NAME="353"></A>not moved, and makes no improvement: he is even in a worse condition. His 
<A NAME="354"></A>modesty is extirpated, and his sense of shame; and the rational faculty 
<A NAME="355"></A>has not been cut off from him, but it is brutalized. Shall I name this 
<A NAME="356"></A>strength of mind? Certainly not, unless we also name it such in catamites, 
<A NAME="357"></A>through which they do and say in public whatever comes into their 
<A NAME="358"></A>head.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="359"></A><B>Chapter 6</B>

<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR>Of providence
<A NAME="361"></A><BR><BR>From everything which is or happens in the world, it is easy to 
<A NAME="362"></A>praise Providence, if a man possesses these two qualities, the faculty 
<A NAME="363"></A>of seeing what belongs and happens to all persons and things, and a grateful 
<A NAME="364"></A>disposition. If he does not possess these two qualities, one man will not 
<A NAME="365"></A>see the use of things which are and which happen; another will not be thankful 
<A NAME="366"></A>for them, even if he does know them. If God had made colours, but had not 
<A NAME="367"></A>made the faculty of seeing them, what would have been their use? None at 
<A NAME="368"></A>all. On the other hand, if He had made the faculty of vision, but had not 
<A NAME="369"></A>made objects such as to fall under the faculty, what in that case also 
<A NAME="370"></A>would have been the use of it? None at all. Well, suppose that He had made 
<A NAME="371"></A>both, but had not made light? In that case, also, they would have been 
<A NAME="372"></A>of no use. Who is it, then, who has fitted this to that and that to this? 
<A NAME="373"></A>And who is it that has fitted the knife to the case and the case to the 
<A NAME="374"></A>knife? Is it no one? And, indeed, from the very structure of things which 
<A NAME="375"></A>have attained their completion, we are accustomed to show that the work 
<A NAME="376"></A>is certainly the act of some artificer, and that it has not been constructed 
<A NAME="377"></A>without a purpose. Does then each of these things demonstrate the workman, 
<A NAME="378"></A>and do not visible things and the faculty of seeing and light demonstrate 
<A NAME="379"></A>Him? And the existence of male and female, and the desire of each for conjunction, 
<A NAME="380"></A>and the power of using the parts which are constructed, do not even these 
<A NAME="381"></A>declare the workman? If they do not, let us consider the constitution of 
<A NAME="382"></A>our understanding according to which, when we meet with sensible objects, 
<A NAME="383"></A>we simply receive impressions from them, but we also select something from 
<A NAME="384"></A>them, and subtract something, and add, and compound by means of them these 
<A NAME="385"></A>things or those, and, in fact, pass from some to other things which, in 
<A NAME="386"></A>a manner, resemble them: is not even this sufficient to move some men, 
<A NAME="387"></A>and to induce them not to forget the workman? If not so, let them explain 
<A NAME="388"></A>to us what it is that makes each several thing, or how it is possible that 
<A NAME="389"></A>things so wonderful and like the contrivances of art should exist by chance 
<A NAME="390"></A>and from their own proper motion?
<A NAME="391"></A><BR><BR>What, then, are these things done in us only. Many, indeed, in 
<A NAME="392"></A>us only, of which the rational animal had peculiar need; but you will find 
<A NAME="393"></A>many common to us with irrational animals. Do they them understand what 
<A NAME="394"></A>is done? By no means. For use is one thing, and understanding is another: 
<A NAME="395"></A>God had need of irrational animals to make use of appearances, but of us 
<A NAME="396"></A>to understand the use of appearances. It is therefore enough for them to 
<A NAME="397"></A>eat and to drink, and to sleep and to copulate, and to do all the other 
<A NAME="398"></A>things which they severally do. But for us, to whom He has given also the 
<A NAME="399"></A>faculty, these things are not sufficient; for unless we act in a proper 
<A NAME="400"></A>and orderly manner, and conformably to the nature and constitution of each 
<A NAME="401"></A>thing, we shall never attain our true end. For where the constitutions 
<A NAME="402"></A>of living beings are different, there also the acts and the ends are different. 
<A NAME="403"></A>In those animals, then, whose constitution is adapted only to use, use 
<A NAME="404"></A>alone is enough: but in an animal which has also the power of understanding 
<A NAME="405"></A>the use, unless there be the due exercise of the understanding, he will 
<A NAME="406"></A>never attain his proper end. Well then God constitutes every animal, one 
<A NAME="407"></A>to be eaten, another to serve for agriculture, another to supply cheese, 
<A NAME="408"></A>and another for some like use; for which purposes what need is there to 
<A NAME="409"></A>understand appearances and to be able to distinguish them? But God has 
<A NAME="410"></A>introduced man to be a spectator of God and of His works; and not only 
<A NAME="411"></A>a spectator of them, but an interpreter. For this reason it is shameful 
<A NAME="412"></A>for man to begin and to end where irrational animals do, but rather he 
<A NAME="413"></A>ought to begin where they begin, and to end where nature ends in us; and 
<A NAME="414"></A>nature ends in contemplation and understanding, in a way of life conformable 
<A NAME="415"></A>to nature. Take care then not to die without having been spectators of 
<A NAME="416"></A>these things.
<A NAME="417"></A><BR><BR>But you take a journey to Olympia to see the work of Phidias, and 
<A NAME="418"></A>all of you think it a misfortune to die without having seen such things. 
<A NAME="419"></A>But when there is no need to take a journey, and where a man is, there 
<A NAME="420"></A>he has the works (of God) before him, will you not desire to see and understand 
<A NAME="421"></A>them? Will you not perceive either what you are, or what you were born 
<A NAME="422"></A>for, or what this is for which you have received the faculty of sight? 
<A NAME="423"></A>But you may say, "There are some things disagreeable and troublesome in 
<A NAME="424"></A>life." And are there none in Olympia? Are you not scorched? Are you not 
<A NAME="425"></A>pressed by a crowd? Are you not without comfortable means of bathing? Are 
<A NAME="426"></A>you not wet when it rains? Have you not abundance of noise, clamour, and 
<A NAME="427"></A>other disagreeable things? But I suppose that setting all these things 
<A NAME="428"></A>off against the magnificence of the spectacle, you bear and endure. Well, 
<A NAME="429"></A>then, and have you not received faculties by which you will be able to 
<A NAME="430"></A>bear all that happens? Have you not received greatness of soul? Have you 
<A NAME="431"></A>not received manliness? Have you not received endurance? And why do I trouble 
<A NAME="432"></A>myself about anything that can happen if I possess greatness of soul? What 
<A NAME="433"></A>shall distract my mind or disturb me, or appear painful? Shall I not use 
<A NAME="434"></A>the power for the purposes for which I received it, and shall I grieve 
<A NAME="435"></A>and lament over what happens?
<A NAME="436"></A><BR><BR>"Yes, but my nose runs." For what purpose then, slave, have you 
<A NAME="437"></A>hands? Is it not that you may wipe your nose? "Is it, then, consistent 
<A NAME="438"></A>with reason that there should be running of noses in the world?" Nay, how 
<A NAME="439"></A>much better it is to wipe your nose than to find fault. What do you think 
<A NAME="440"></A>that Hercules would have been if there had not been such a lion, and hydra, 
<A NAME="441"></A>and stag, and boar, and certain unjust and bestial men, whom Hercules used 
<A NAME="442"></A>to drive away and clear out? And what would he have been doing if there 
<A NAME="443"></A>had been nothing of the kind? Is it not plain that he would have wrapped 
<A NAME="444"></A>himself up and have slept? In the first place, then he would not have been 
<A NAME="445"></A>a Hercules, when he was dreaming away all his life in such luxury and case; 
<A NAME="446"></A>and even if he had been one what would have been the use of him? and what 
<A NAME="447"></A>the use of his arms, and of the strength of the other parts of his body, 
<A NAME="448"></A>and his endurance and noble spirit, if such circumstances and occasions 
<A NAME="449"></A>had not roused and exercised him? "Well, then, must a man provide for himself 
<A NAME="450"></A>such means of exercise, and to introduce a lion from some place into his 
<A NAME="451"></A>country, and a boar and a hydra?" This would be folly and madness: but 
<A NAME="452"></A>as they did exist, and were found, they were useful for showing what Hercules 
<A NAME="453"></A>was and for exercising him. Come then do you also having observed these 
<A NAME="454"></A>things look to the faculties which you have, and when you have looked at 
<A NAME="455"></A>them, say: "Bring now, O Zeus, any difficulty that Thou pleasest, for I 
<A NAME="456"></A>have means given to me by Thee and powers for honoring myself through the 
<A NAME="457"></A>things which happen." You do not so; but you sit still, trembling for fear 
<A NAME="458"></A>that some things will happen, and weeping, and lamenting and groaning for 
<A NAME="459"></A>what does happen: and then you blame the gods. For what is the consequence 
<A NAME="460"></A>of such meanness of spirit but impiety? And yet God has not only given 
<A NAME="461"></A>us these faculties; by which we shall be able to bear everything that happens 
<A NAME="462"></A>without being depressed or broken by it; but, like a good king and a true 
<A NAME="463"></A>father, He has given us these faculties free from hindrance, subject to 
<A NAME="464"></A>no compulsion unimpeded, and has put them entirely in our own power, without 
<A NAME="465"></A>even having reserved to Himself any power of hindering or impeding. You, 
<A NAME="466"></A>who have received these powers free and as your own, use them not: you 
<A NAME="467"></A>do not even see what you have received, and from whom; some of you being 
<A NAME="468"></A>blinded to the giver, and not even acknowledging your benefactor, and others, 
<A NAME="469"></A>through meanness of spirit, betaking yourselves to fault finding and making 
<A NAME="470"></A>charges against God. Yet I will show to you that you have powers and means 
<A NAME="471"></A>for greatness of soul and manliness but what powers you have for finding 
<A NAME="472"></A>fault and making accusations, do you show me.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="473"></A><B>Chapter 7</B>

<A NAME="474"></A><BR><BR>Of the use of sophistical arguments, and hypothetical, and the 
<A NAME="475"></A>like
<A NAME="476"></A><BR><BR>The handling of sophistical and hypothetical arguments, and of 
<A NAME="477"></A>those which derive their conclusions from questioning, and in a word the 
<A NAME="478"></A>handling of all such arguments, relates to the duties of life, though the 
<A NAME="479"></A>many do not know this truth. For in every matter we inquire how the wise 
<A NAME="480"></A>and good man shall discover the proper path and the proper method of dealing 
<A NAME="481"></A>with the matter. Let, then, people either say that the grave man will not 
<A NAME="482"></A>descend into the contest of question and answer, or that, if he does descend 
<A NAME="483"></A>into the contest, he will take no care about not conducting himself rashly 
<A NAME="484"></A>or carelessly in questioning and answering. But if they do not allow either 
<A NAME="485"></A>the one or the other of these things, they must admit that some inquiry 
<A NAME="486"></A>ought to be made into those topics on which particularly questioning and 
<A NAME="487"></A>answering are employed. For what is the end proposed in reasoning? To establish 
<A NAME="488"></A>true propositions, to remove the false, to withhold assent from those which 
<A NAME="489"></A>are not plain. Is it enough then to have learned only this? "It is enough," 
<A NAME="490"></A>a man may reply. Is it, then, also enough for a man, who would not make 
<A NAME="491"></A>a mistake in the use of coined money, to have heard this precept, that 
<A NAME="492"></A>he should receive the genuine drachmae and reject the spurious? "It is 
<A NAME="493"></A>not enough." What, then, ought to be added to this precept? What else than 
<A NAME="494"></A>the faculty which proves and distinguishes the genuine and the spurious 
<A NAME="495"></A>drachmae? Consequently also in reasoning what has been said is not enough; 
<A NAME="496"></A>but is it necessary that a man should acquire the faculty of examining 
<A NAME="497"></A>and distinguishing the true and the false, and that which is not plain? 
<A NAME="498"></A>"It is necessary." Besides this, what is proposed in reasoning? "That you 
<A NAME="499"></A>should accept what follows from that which you have properly granted." 
<A NAME="500"></A>Well, is it then enough in this case also to know this? It is not enough; 
<A NAME="501"></A>but a man must learn how one thing is a consequence of other things, and 
<A NAME="502"></A>when one thing follows from one thing, and when it follows from several 
<A NAME="503"></A>collectively. Consider, then if it be not necessary that this power should 
<A NAME="504"></A>also be acquired by him who purposes to conduct himself skillfully in reasoning, 
<A NAME="505"></A>the power of demonstrating himself the several things which he has proposed, 
<A NAME="506"></A>and the power of understanding the demonstrations of others, including 
<A NAME="507"></A>of not being deceived by sophists, as if they were demonstrating. Therefore 
<A NAME="508"></A>there has arisen among us the practice and exercise of conclusive arguments 
<A NAME="509"></A>and figures, and it has been shown to be necessary.
<A NAME="510"></A><BR><BR>But in fact in some cases we have properly granted the premisses 
<A NAME="511"></A>or assumptions, and there results from them something; and though it is 
<A NAME="512"></A>not true, yet none the less it does result. What then ought I to do? Ought 
<A NAME="513"></A>I to admit the falsehood? And how is that possible? Well, should I say 
<A NAME="514"></A>that I did not properly grant that which we agreed upon? "But you are not 
<A NAME="515"></A>allowed to do even this." Shall I then say that the consequence does not 
<A NAME="516"></A>arise through what has been conceded? "But neither is it allowed." What 
<A NAME="517"></A>then must be done in this case? Consider if it is not this: as to have 
<A NAME="518"></A>borrowed is not enough to make a man still a debtor, but to this must be 
<A NAME="519"></A>added the fact that he continues to owe the money and that the debt is 
<A NAME="520"></A>not paid, so it is not enough to compel you to admit the inference that 
<A NAME="521"></A>you have granted the premisses, but you must abide by what you have granted. 
<A NAME="522"></A>Indeed, if the premisses continue to the end such as they were when they 
<A NAME="523"></A>were granted, it is absolutely necessary for us to abide by what we have 
<A NAME="524"></A>granted, and we must accept their consequences: but if the premisses do 
<A NAME="525"></A>not remain such as they were when they were granted, it is absolutely necessary 
<A NAME="526"></A>for us also to withdraw from what we granted, and from accepting what does 
<A NAME="527"></A>not follow from the words in which our concessions were made. For the inference 
<A NAME="528"></A>is now not our inference, nor does it result with our assent, since we 
<A NAME="529"></A>have withdrawn from the premisses which we granted. We ought then both 
<A NAME="530"></A>to examine such kind of premisses, and such change and variation of them, 
<A NAME="531"></A>by which in the course of questioning or answering, or in making the syllogistic 
<A NAME="532"></A>conclusion, or in any other such way, the premisses undergo variations, 
<A NAME="533"></A>and give occasion to the foolish to be confounded, if they do not see what 
<A NAME="534"></A>conclusions are. For what reason ought we to examine? In order that we 
<A NAME="535"></A>may not in this matter be employed in an improper manner nor in a confused 
<A NAME="536"></A>way.
<A NAME="537"></A><BR><BR>And the same in hypotheses and hypothetical arguments; for it is 
<A NAME="538"></A>necessary sometimes to demand the granting of some hypothesis as a kind 
<A NAME="539"></A>of passage to the argument which follows. Must we then allow every hypothesis 
<A NAME="540"></A>that is proposed, or not allow every one? And if not every one, which should 
<A NAME="541"></A>we allow? And if a man has allowed an hypothesis, must he in every case 
<A NAME="542"></A>abide by allowing it? or must he sometimes withdraw from it, but admit 
<A NAME="543"></A>the consequences and not admit contradictions? Yes; but suppose that a 
<A NAME="544"></A>man says, "If you admit the hypothesis of a possibility, I will draw you 
<A NAME="545"></A>to an impossibility." With such a person shall a man of sense refuse to 
<A NAME="546"></A>enter into a contest, and avoid discussion and conversation with him? But 
<A NAME="547"></A>what other man than the man of sense can use argumentation and is skillful 
<A NAME="548"></A>in questioning and answering, and incapable of being cheated and deceived 
<A NAME="549"></A>by false reasoning? And shall he enter into the contest, and yet not take 
<A NAME="550"></A>care whether he shall engage in argument not rashly and not carelessly? 
<A NAME="551"></A>And if he does not take care, how can he be such a man as we conceive him 
<A NAME="552"></A>to be? But without some such exercise and preparation, can he maintain 
<A NAME="553"></A>a continuous and consistent argument? Let them show this; and all these 
<A NAME="554"></A>speculations become superfluous, and are absurd and inconsistent with our 
<A NAME="555"></A>notion of a good and serious man.
<A NAME="556"></A><BR><BR>Why are we still indolent and negligent and sluggish, and why do 
<A NAME="557"></A>we seek pretences for not labouring and not being watchful in cultivating 
<A NAME="558"></A>our reason? "If then I shall make a mistake in these matters may I not 
<A NAME="559"></A>have killed my father?" Slave, where was there a father in this matter 
<A NAME="560"></A>that you could kill him? What, then, have you done? The only fault that 
<A NAME="561"></A>was possible here is the fault which you have committed. This is the very 
<A NAME="562"></A>remark which I made to Rufus when he blamed me for not having discovered 
<A NAME="563"></A>the one thing omitted in a certain syllogism: "I suppose," I said, "that 
<A NAME="564"></A>I have burnt the Capitol." "Slave," he replied, "was the thing omitted 
<A NAME="565"></A>here the Capitol?" Or are these the only crimes, to burn the Capitol and 
<A NAME="566"></A>to kill your father? But for a man to use the appearances resented to him 
<A NAME="567"></A>rashly and foolishly and carelessly, not to understand argument, nor demonstration, 
<A NAME="568"></A>nor sophism, nor, in a word, to see in questioning and answering what is 
<A NAME="569"></A>consistent with that which we have granted or is not consistent; is there 
<A NAME="570"></A>no error in this?
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="571"></A><B>Chapter 8</B>

<A NAME="572"></A><BR><BR>That the faculties are not safe to the uninstructed
<A NAME="573"></A><BR><BR>In as many ways as we can change things which are equivalent to 
<A NAME="574"></A>one another, in just so many ways we can change the forms of arguments 
<A NAME="575"></A>and enthymemes in argumentation. This is an instance: "If you have borrowed 
<A NAME="576"></A>and not repaid, you owe me the money: you have not borrowed and you have 
<A NAME="577"></A>not repaid; then you do not owe me the money." To do this skillfully is 
<A NAME="578"></A>suitable to no man more than to the philosopher; for if the enthymeme is 
<A NAME="579"></A>all imperfect syllogism. it is plain that he who has been exercised in 
<A NAME="580"></A>the perfect syllogism must be equally expert in the imperfect 
<A NAME="581"></A>also.
<A NAME="582"></A><BR><BR>"Why then do we not exercise ourselves and one another in this 
<A NAME="583"></A>manner?" Because, I reply, at present, though we are not exercised in these 
<A NAME="584"></A>things and not distracted from the study of morality, by me at least, still 
<A NAME="585"></A>we make no progress in virtue. What then must we expect if we should add 
<A NAME="586"></A>this occupation? and particularly as this would not only be an occupation 
<A NAME="587"></A>which would withdraw us from more necessary things, but would also be a 
<A NAME="588"></A>cause of self conceit and arrogance, and no small cause. For great is the 
<A NAME="589"></A>power of arguing and the faculty of persuasion, and particularly if it 
<A NAME="590"></A>should be much exercised, and also receive additional ornament from language: 
<A NAME="591"></A>and so universally, every faculty acquired by the uninstructed and weak 
<A NAME="592"></A>brings with it the danger of these persons being elated and inflated by 
<A NAME="593"></A>it. For by what means could one persuade a young man who excels in these 
<A NAME="594"></A>matters that he ought not to become an appendage to them, but to make them 
<A NAME="595"></A>an appendage to himself? Does he not trample on all such reasons, and strut 
<A NAME="596"></A>before us elated and inflated, not enduring that any man should reprove 
<A NAME="597"></A>him and remind him of what he has neglected and to what he has turned 
<A NAME="598"></A>aside?
<A NAME="599"></A><BR><BR>"What, then, was not Plato a philosopher?" I reply, "And was not 
<A NAME="600"></A>Hippocrates a physician? but you see how Hippocrates speaks." Does Hippocrates, 
<A NAME="601"></A>then, speak thus in respect of being a physician? Why do you mingle things 
<A NAME="602"></A>which have been accidentally united in the same men? And if Plato was handsome 
<A NAME="603"></A>and strong, ought I also to set to work and endeavor to become handsome 
<A NAME="604"></A>or strong, as if this was necessary for philosophy, because a certain philosopher 
<A NAME="605"></A>was at the same time handsome and a philosopher? Will you not choose to 
<A NAME="606"></A>see and to distinguish in respect to what men become philosophers, and 
<A NAME="607"></A>what things belong to belong to them in other respects? And if I were a 
<A NAME="608"></A>philosopher, ought you also to be made lame? What then? Do I take away 
<A NAME="609"></A>these faculties which you possess? By no means; for neither do I take away 
<A NAME="610"></A>the faculty of seeing. But if you ask me what is the good of man, I cannot 
<A NAME="611"></A>mention to you anything else than that it is a certain disposition of the 
<A NAME="612"></A>will with respect to appearances.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="613"></A><B>Chapter 9</B>

<A NAME="614"></A><BR><BR>How from the fact that we are akin to God a man may proceed to 
<A NAME="615"></A>the consequences
<A NAME="616"></A><BR><BR>If the things are true which are said by the philosophers about 
<A NAME="617"></A>the kinship between God and man, what else remains for men to do then what 
<A NAME="618"></A>Socrates did? Never in reply to the question, to what country you belong, 
<A NAME="619"></A>say that you are an Athenian or a Corinthian, but that you are a citizen 
<A NAME="620"></A>of the world. For why do you say that you are an Athenian, and why do you 
<A NAME="621"></A>not say that you belong to the small nook only into which your poor body 
<A NAME="622"></A>was cast at birth? Is it not plain that you call yourself an Athenian or 
<A NAME="623"></A>Corinthian from the place which has a greater authority and comprises not 
<A NAME="624"></A>only that small nook itself and all your family, but even the whole country 
<A NAME="625"></A>from which the stock of your progenitors is derived down to you? He then 
<A NAME="626"></A>who has observed with intelligence the administration of the world, and 
<A NAME="627"></A>has learned that the greatest and supreme and the most comprehensive community 
<A NAME="628"></A>is that which is composed of men and God, and that from God have descended 
<A NAME="629"></A>the seeds not only to my father and grandfather, but to all beings which 
<A NAME="630"></A>are generated on the earth and are produced, and particularly to rational 
<A NAME="631"></A>beings- for these only are by their nature formed to have communion with 
<A NAME="632"></A>God, being by means of reason conjoined with Him- why should not such a 
<A NAME="633"></A>man call himself a citizen of the world, why not a son of God, and why 
<A NAME="634"></A>should he be afraid of anything which happens among men? Is kinship with 
<A NAME="635"></A>Caesar or with any other of the powerful in Rome sufficient to enable us 
<A NAME="636"></A>to live in safety, and above contempt and without any fear at all? and 
<A NAME="637"></A>to have God for your maker and father and guardian, shall not this release 
<A NAME="638"></A>us from sorrows and fears?
<A NAME="639"></A><BR><BR>But a man may say, "Whence shall I get bread to eat when I have 
<A NAME="640"></A>nothing?"
<A NAME="641"></A><BR><BR>And how do slaves, and runaways, on what do they rely when they 
<A NAME="642"></A>leave their masters? Do they rely on their lands or slaves, or their vessels 
<A NAME="643"></A>of silver? They rely on nothing but themselves, and food does not fail 
<A NAME="644"></A>them. And shall it be necessary for one among us who is a philosopher to 
<A NAME="645"></A>travel into foreign parts, and trust to and rely on others, and not to 
<A NAME="646"></A>take care of himself, and shall he be inferior to irrational animals and 
<A NAME="647"></A>more cowardly, each of which, being self-sufficient, neither fails to get 
<A NAME="648"></A>its proper food, nor to find a suitable way of living, and one conformable 
<A NAME="649"></A>to nature?
<A NAME="650"></A><BR><BR>I indeed think that the old man ought to be sitting here, not to 
<A NAME="651"></A>contrive how you may have no mean thoughts nor mean and ignoble talk about 
<A NAME="652"></A>yourselves, but to take care that there be not among us any young men of 
<A NAME="653"></A>such a mind that, when they have recognized their kinship to God, and that 
<A NAME="654"></A>we are fettered by these bonds, the body, I mean, and its possessions, 
<A NAME="655"></A>and whatever else on account of them is necessary to us for the economy 
<A NAME="656"></A>and commerce of life, they should intend to throw off these things as if 
<A NAME="657"></A>they were burdens painful and intolerable, and to depart to their kinsmen. 
<A NAME="658"></A>But this is the labour that your teacher and instructor ought to be employed 
<A NAME="659"></A>upon, if he really were what he should be. You should come to him and say, 
<A NAME="660"></A>"Epictetus, we can no longer endure being bound to this poor body, and 
<A NAME="661"></A>feeding it and giving it drink, and rest, and cleaning it, and for the 
<A NAME="662"></A>sake of the body complying with the wishes of these and of those. Are not 
<A NAME="663"></A>these things indifferent and nothing to us, and is not death no evil? And 
<A NAME="664"></A>are we not in a manner kinsmen of God, and did we not come from Him? Allow 
<A NAME="665"></A>us to depart to the place from which we came; allow us to be released at 
<A NAME="666"></A>last from these bonds by which we are bound and weighed down. Here there 
<A NAME="667"></A>are robbers and thieves and courts of justice, and those who are named 
<A NAME="668"></A>tyrants, and think that they have some power over us by means of the body 
<A NAME="669"></A>and its possessions. Permit us to show them that they have no power over 
<A NAME="670"></A>any man." And I on my part would say, "Friends, wait for God; when He shall 
<A NAME="671"></A>give the signal and release you from this service, then go to Him; but 
<A NAME="672"></A>for the present endure to dwell in this place where He has put you: short 
<A NAME="673"></A>indeed is this time of your dwelling here, and easy to bear for those who 
<A NAME="674"></A>are so disposed: for what tyrant or what thief, or what courts of justice, 
<A NAME="675"></A>are formidable to those who have thus considered as things of no value 
<A NAME="676"></A>the body and the possessions of the body? Wait then, do not depart without 
<A NAME="677"></A>a reason."
<A NAME="678"></A><BR><BR>Something like this ought to be said by the teacher to ingenuous 
<A NAME="679"></A>youths. But now what happens? The teacher is a lifeless body, and you are 
<A NAME="680"></A>lifeless bodies. When you have been well filled to-day, you sit down and 
<A NAME="681"></A>lament about the morrow, how you shall get something to eat. Wretch, if 
<A NAME="682"></A>you have it, you will have it; if you have it not, you will depart from 
<A NAME="683"></A>life. The door is open. Why do you grieve? where does there remain any 
<A NAME="684"></A>room for tears? and where is there occasion for flattery? why shall one 
<A NAME="685"></A>man envy another? why should a man admire the rich or the powerful, even 
<A NAME="686"></A>if they be both very strong and of violent temper? for what will they do 
<A NAME="687"></A>to us? We shall not care for that which they can do; and what we do care 
<A NAME="688"></A>for, that they cannot do. How did Socrates behave with respect to these 
<A NAME="689"></A>matters? Why, in what other way than a man ought to do who was convinced 
<A NAME="690"></A>that he was a kinsman of the gods? "If you say to me now," said Socrates 
<A NAME="691"></A>to his judges, "'We will acquit you on the condition that you no longer 
<A NAME="692"></A>discourse in the way in which you have hitherto discoursed, nor trouble 
<A NAME="693"></A>either our young or our old men,' I shall answer, 'you make yourselves 
<A NAME="694"></A>ridiculous by thinking that, if one of our commanders has appointed me 
<A NAME="695"></A>to a certain post, it is my duty to keep and maintain it, and to resolve 
<A NAME="696"></A>to die a thousand times rather than desert it; but if God has put us in 
<A NAME="697"></A>any place and way of life, we ought to desert it.'" Socrates speaks like 
<A NAME="698"></A>a man who is really a kinsman of the gods. But we think about ourselves 
<A NAME="699"></A>as if we were only stomachs, and intestines, and shameful parts; we fear, 
<A NAME="700"></A>we desire; we flatter those who are able to help us in these matters, and 
<A NAME="701"></A>we fear them also.
<A NAME="702"></A><BR><BR>A man asked me to write to Rome about him, a man who, as most people 
<A NAME="703"></A>thought, had been unfortunate, for formerly he was a man of rank and rich, 
<A NAME="704"></A>but had been stripped of all, and was living here. I wrote on his behalf 
<A NAME="705"></A>in a submissive manner; but when he had read the letter, he gave it back 
<A NAME="706"></A>to me and said, "I wished for your help, not your pity: no evil has happened 
<A NAME="707"></A>to me."
<A NAME="708"></A><BR><BR>Thus also Musonius Rufus, in order to try me, used to say: "This 
<A NAME="709"></A>and this will befall you from your master"; and I replied that these were 
<A NAME="710"></A>things which happen in the ordinary course of human affairs. "Why, then," 
<A NAME="711"></A>said he, "should I ask him for anything when I can obtain it from you?" 
<A NAME="712"></A>For, in fact, what a man has from himself, it is superfluous and foolish 
<A NAME="713"></A>to receive from another? Shall I, then, who am able to receive from myself 
<A NAME="714"></A>greatness of soul and a generous spirit, receive from you land and money 
<A NAME="715"></A>or a magisterial office? I hope not: I will not be so ignorant about my 
<A NAME="716"></A>own possessions. But when a man is cowardly and mean, what else must be 
<A NAME="717"></A>done for him than to write letters as you would about a corpse. "Please 
<A NAME="718"></A>to grant us the body of a certain person and a sextarius of poor blood." 
<A NAME="719"></A>For such a person is, in fact, a carcass and a sextarius of blood, and 
<A NAME="720"></A>nothing more. But if he were anything more, he would know that one man 
<A NAME="721"></A>is not miserable through the means of another.

<A NAME="722"></A><B>Chapter 10</B>

<A NAME="723"></A><BR><BR>Against those who eagerly seek preferment at 
<A NAME="724"></A>Rome
<A NAME="725"></A><BR><BR>If we applied ourselves as busily to our own work as the old men 
<A NAME="726"></A>at Rome do to those matters about which they are employed, perhaps we also 
<A NAME="727"></A>might accomplish something. I am acquainted with a man older than myself 
<A NAME="728"></A>who is now superintendent of corn at Rome, and remember the time when he 
<A NAME="729"></A>came here on his way back from exile, and what he said as he related the 
<A NAME="730"></A>events of his former life, and how he declared that with respect to the 
<A NAME="731"></A>future after his return he would look after nothing else than passing the 
<A NAME="732"></A>rest of his life in quiet and tranquillity. "For how little of life," he 
<A NAME="733"></A>said, remains for me." I replied, "You will not do it, but as soon as you 
<A NAME="734"></A>smell Rome, you will forget all that you have said; and if admission is 
<A NAME="735"></A>allowed even into the imperial palace, you will gladly thrust yourself 
<A NAME="736"></A>in and thank God." "If you find me, Epictetus," he answered, "setting even 
<A NAME="737"></A>one foot within the palace, think what you please." Well, what then did 
<A NAME="738"></A>he do? Before he entered the city he was met by letters from Caesar, and 
<A NAME="739"></A>as soon as he received them he forgot all, and ever after has added one 
<A NAME="740"></A>piece of business to another. I wish that I were now by his side to remind 
<A NAME="741"></A>him of what he said when he was passing this way and to tell him how much 
<A NAME="742"></A>better a seer I am than he is.
<A NAME="743"></A><BR><BR>Well, then, do I say that man is an animal made for doing nothing? 
<A NAME="744"></A>Certainly not. But why are we not active? For example, as to myself, as 
<A NAME="745"></A>soon as day comes, in a few words I remind myself of what I must read over 
<A NAME="746"></A>to my pupils; then forthwith I say to myself, "But what is it to me how 
<A NAME="747"></A>a certain person shall read? the first thing for me is to sleep." And indeed 
<A NAME="748"></A>what resemblance is there between what other persons do and what we do? 
<A NAME="749"></A>If you observe what they do, you will understand. And what else do they 
<A NAME="750"></A>do all day long than make up accounts, inquire among themselves, give and 
<A NAME="751"></A>take advice about some small quantity of grain, a bit of land, and such 
<A NAME="752"></A>kind of profits? Is it then the same thing to receive a petition and to 
<A NAME="753"></A>read in it: "I entreat you to permit me to export a small quantity of corn"; 
<A NAME="754"></A>and one to this effect: "I entreat you to learn from Chrysippus what is 
<A NAME="755"></A>the administration of the world, and what place in it the rational animal 
<A NAME="756"></A>holds; consider also who you are, and what is the nature of your good and 
<A NAME="757"></A>bad." Are these things like the other, do they require equal care, and 
<A NAME="758"></A>is it equally base to neglect these and those? Well, then, are we the only 
<A NAME="759"></A>persons who are lazy and love sleep? No; but much rather you young men 
<A NAME="760"></A>are. For we old men, when we see young men amusing themselves, are eager 
<A NAME="761"></A>to play with them; and if I saw you active and zealous, much more should 
<A NAME="762"></A>I be eager myself to join you in your serious pursuits.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="763"></A><B>Chapter 11</B>

<A NAME="764"></A><BR><BR>Of natural affection
<A NAME="765"></A><BR><BR>When he was visited by one of the magistrates, Epictetus inquired 
<A NAME="766"></A>of him about several particulars, and asked if he had children and a wife. 
<A NAME="767"></A>The man replied that he had; and Epictetus inquired further, how he felt 
<A NAME="768"></A>under the circumstances. "Miserable," the man said. Then Epictetus asked, 
<A NAME="769"></A>"In what respect," for men do not marry and beget children in order to 
<A NAME="770"></A>be wretched, but rather to be happy. "But I," the man replied, "am so wretched 
<A NAME="771"></A>about my children that lately, when my little daughter was sick and was 
<A NAME="772"></A>supposed to be in danger, I could not endure to stay with her, but I left 
<A NAME="773"></A>home till a person sent me news that she had recovered." Well then, said 
<A NAME="774"></A>Epictetus, do you think that you acted right? "I acted naturally," the 
<A NAME="775"></A>man replied. But convince me of this that you acted naturally, and I will 
<A NAME="776"></A>convince you that everything which takes place according to nature takes 
<A NAME="777"></A>place rightly. "This is the case," said the man, "with all or at least 
<A NAME="778"></A>most fathers." I do not deny that: but the matter about which we are inquiring 
<A NAME="779"></A>is whether such behavior is right; for in respect to this matter we must 
<A NAME="780"></A>say that tumours also come for the good of the body, because they do come; 
<A NAME="781"></A>and generally we must say that to do wrong is natural, because nearly all 
<A NAME="782"></A>or at least most of us do wrong. Do you show me then how your behavior 
<A NAME="783"></A>is natural. "I cannot," he said; "but do you rather show me how it is not 
<A NAME="784"></A>according to nature and is not rightly done.
<A NAME="785"></A><BR><BR>Well, said Epictetus, if we were inquiring about white and black, 
<A NAME="786"></A>what criterion should we employ for distinguishing between them? "The sight," 
<A NAME="787"></A>he said. And if about hot and cold, and hard and soft, what criterion? 
<A NAME="788"></A>"The touch." Well then, since we are inquiring about things which are according 
<A NAME="789"></A>to nature, and those which are done rightly or not rightly, what kind of 
<A NAME="790"></A>criterion do you think that we should employ? "I do not know," he said. 
<A NAME="791"></A>And yet not to know the criterion of colors and smells, and also of tastes, 
<A NAME="792"></A>is perhaps no great harm; but if a man do not know the criterion of good 
<A NAME="793"></A>and bad, and of things according to nature and contrary to nature, does 
<A NAME="794"></A>this seem to you a small harm? "The greatest harm." Come tell me, do all 
<A NAME="795"></A>things which seem to some persons to be good and becoming rightly appear 
<A NAME="796"></A>such; and at present as to Jews and Syrians and Egyptians and Romans, is 
<A NAME="797"></A>it possible that the opinions of all of them in respect to food are right? 
<A NAME="798"></A>"How is it possible?" he said. Well, I suppose it is absolutely necessary 
<A NAME="799"></A>that, if the opinions of the Egyptians are right, the opinions of the rest 
<A NAME="800"></A>must be wrong: if the opinions of the Jews are right, those of the rest 
<A NAME="801"></A>cannot be right. "Certainly." But where there is ignorance, there also 
<A NAME="802"></A>there is want of learning and training in things which are necessary. He 
<A NAME="803"></A>assented to this. You then, said Epictetus, since you know this, for the 
<A NAME="804"></A>future will employ yourself seriously about nothing else, and will apply 
<A NAME="805"></A>your mind to nothing else than to learn the criterion of things which are 
<A NAME="806"></A>according to nature, and by using it also to determine each several thing. 
<A NAME="807"></A>But in the present matter I have so much as this to aid you toward what 
<A NAME="808"></A>you wish. Does affection to those of your family appear to you to be according 
<A NAME="809"></A>to nature and to be good? "Certainly." Well, is such affection natural 
<A NAME="810"></A>and good, and is a thing consistent with reason not good? "By no means." 
<A NAME="811"></A>Is then that which is consistent with reason in contradiction with affection? 
<A NAME="812"></A>"I think not." You are right, for if it is otherwise, it is necessary that 
<A NAME="813"></A>one of the contradictions being according to nature, the other must be 
<A NAME="814"></A>contrary to nature. Is it not so? "It is," he said. Whatever, then, we 
<A NAME="815"></A>shall discover to be at the same time affectionate and also consistent 
<A NAME="816"></A>with reason, this we confidently declare to be right and good. "Agreed." 
<A NAME="817"></A>Well then to leave your sick child and to go away is not reasonable, and 
<A NAME="818"></A>I suppose that you will not say that it is; but it remains for us to inquire 
<A NAME="819"></A>if it is consistent with affection. "Yes, let us consider." Did you, then, 
<A NAME="820"></A>since you had an affectionate disposition to your child, do right when 
<A NAME="821"></A>you ran off and left her; and has the mother no affection for the child? 
<A NAME="822"></A>"Certainly, she has." Ought, then, the mother also to have left her, or 
<A NAME="823"></A>ought she not? "She ought not." And the nurse, does she love her? "She 
<A NAME="824"></A>does." Ought, then, she also to have left her? "By no means." And the pedagogue, 
<A NAME="825"></A>does he not love her? "He does love her." Ought, then, he also to have 
<A NAME="826"></A>deserted her? and so should the child have been left alone and without 
<A NAME="827"></A>help on account of the great affection of you, the parents, and of those 
<A NAME="828"></A>about her, or should she have died in the hands of those who neither loved 
<A NAME="829"></A>her nor cared for her? "Certainly not." Now this is unfair and unreasonable, 
<A NAME="830"></A>not to allow those who have equal affection with yourself to do what you 
<A NAME="831"></A>think to be proper for yourself to do because you have affection. It is 
<A NAME="832"></A>absurd. Come then, if you were sick, would you wish your relations to be 
<A NAME="833"></A>so affectionate, and all the rest, children and wife, as to leave you alone 
<A NAME="834"></A>and deserted? "By no means." And would you wish to be so loved by your 
<A NAME="835"></A>own that through their excessive affection you would always be left alone 
<A NAME="836"></A>in sickness? or for this reason would you rather pray, if it were possible, 
<A NAME="837"></A>to be loved by your enemies and deserted by them? But if this is so, it 
<A NAME="838"></A>results that your behavior was not at all an affectionate 
<A NAME="839"></A>act.
<A NAME="840"></A><BR><BR>Well then, was it nothing which moved you and induced you to desert 
<A NAME="841"></A>your child? and how is that possible? But it might be something of the 
<A NAME="842"></A>kind which moved a man at Rome to wrap up his head while a horse was running 
<A NAME="843"></A>which he favoured; and when contrary to expectation the horse won, he required 
<A NAME="844"></A>sponges to recover from his fainting fit. What then is the thing which 
<A NAME="845"></A>moved? The exact discussion of this does not belong to the present occasion 
<A NAME="846"></A>perhaps; but it is enough to be convinced of this, if what the philosophers 
<A NAME="847"></A>say is true, that we must not look for it anywhere without, but in all 
<A NAME="848"></A>cases it is one and the same thing which is the cause of our doing or not 
<A NAME="849"></A>doing something, of saying or not saying something, of being elated or 
<A NAME="850"></A>depressed, of avoiding anything or pursuing: the very thing which is now 
<A NAME="851"></A>the cause to me and to you, to you of coming to me and sitting and hearing, 
<A NAME="852"></A>and to me of saying what I do say. And what is this? Is it any other than 
<A NAME="853"></A>our will to do so? "No other." But if we had willed otherwise, what else 
<A NAME="854"></A>should we have been doing than that which we willed to do? This, then, 
<A NAME="855"></A>was the cause of Achilles' lamentation, not the death of Patroclus; for 
<A NAME="856"></A>another man does not behave thus on the death of his companion; but it 
<A NAME="857"></A>was because he chose to do so. And to you this was the very cause of your 
<A NAME="858"></A>then running away, that you chose to do so; and on the other side, if you 
<A NAME="859"></A>should stay with her, the reason will be the same. And now you are going 
<A NAME="860"></A>to Rome because you choose; and if you should change your mind, you will 
<A NAME="861"></A>not go thither. And in a word, neither death nor exile nor pain nor anything 
<A NAME="862"></A>of the kind is the cause of our doing anything or not doing; but our own 
<A NAME="863"></A>opinions and our wills.
<A NAME="864"></A><BR><BR>Do I convince you of this or not? "You do convince me." Such, then, 
<A NAME="865"></A>as the causes are in each case, such also are the effects. When, then, 
<A NAME="866"></A>we are doing anything not rightly, from this day we shall impute it to 
<A NAME="867"></A>nothing else than to the will from which we have done it: and it is that 
<A NAME="868"></A>which we shall endeavour to take away and to extirpate more than the tumours 
<A NAME="869"></A>and abscesses out of the body. And in like manner we shall give the same 
<A NAME="870"></A>account of the cause of the things which we do right; and we shall no longer 
<A NAME="871"></A>allege as causes of any evil to us, either slave or neighbour, or wife 
<A NAME="872"></A>or children, being persuaded that, if we do not think things to he what 
<A NAME="873"></A>we do think them to be, we do not the acts which follow from such opinions; 
<A NAME="874"></A>and as to thinking or not thinking, that is in our power and not in externals. 
<A NAME="875"></A>"It is so," he said. From this day then we shall inquire into and examine 
<A NAME="876"></A>nothing else, what its quality is, or its state, neither land nor slaves 
<A NAME="877"></A>nor horses nor dogs, nothing else than opinions. "I hope so." You see, 
<A NAME="878"></A>then, that you must become a Scholasticus, an animal whom all ridicule, 
<A NAME="879"></A>if you really intend to make an examination of your own opinions: and that 
<A NAME="880"></A>this is not the work of one hour or day, you know yourself.

<A NAME="881"></A><B>Chapter 12</B>

<A NAME="882"></A><BR><BR>Of contentment
<A NAME="883"></A><BR><BR>With respect to gods, there are some who say that a divine being 
<A NAME="884"></A>does not exist: others say that it exists, but is inactive and careless, 
<A NAME="885"></A>and takes no forethought about anything; a third class say that such a 
<A NAME="886"></A>being exists and exercises forethought, but only about great things and 
<A NAME="887"></A>heavenly things, and about nothing on the earth; a fourth class say that 
<A NAME="888"></A>a divine being exercises forethought both about things on the earth and 
<A NAME="889"></A>heavenly things, but in a general way only, and not about things severally. 
<A NAME="890"></A>There is a fifth class to whom Ulysses and Socrates belong, who say: "I 
<A NAME="891"></A>move not without thy knowledge."
<A NAME="892"></A><BR><BR>Before all other things, then, it is necessary to inquire about 
<A NAME="893"></A>each of these opinions, whether it is affirmed truly or not truly. For 
<A NAME="894"></A>if there are no gods, how is it our proper end to follow them? And if they 
<A NAME="895"></A>exist, but take no care of anything, in this case also how will it be right 
<A NAME="896"></A>to follow them? But if indeed they do exist and look after things, still 
<A NAME="897"></A>if there is nothing communicated from them to men, nor in fact to myself, 
<A NAME="898"></A>how even so is it right? The wise and good man, then, after considering 
<A NAME="899"></A>all these things, submits his own mind to him who administers the whole, 
<A NAME="900"></A>as good citizens do to the law of the state. He who is receiving instruction 
<A NAME="901"></A>ought to come to the instructed with this intention: How shall I follow 
<A NAME="902"></A>the gods in all things, how shall I be contented with the divine administration, 
<A NAME="903"></A>and how can I become free?" For he is free to whom everything happens according, 
<A NAME="904"></A>to his will, and whom no man can hinder. "What then, is freedom madness?" 
<A NAME="905"></A>Certainly not: for madness and freedom do not consist. "But," you say, 
<A NAME="906"></A>"I would have everything result just as I like, and in whatever way I like." 
<A NAME="907"></A>You are mad, you are beside yourself. Do you not know that freedom is a 
<A NAME="908"></A>noble and valuable thing? But for me inconsiderately to wish for things 
<A NAME="909"></A>to happen as I inconsiderately like, this appears to be not only not noble, 
<A NAME="910"></A>but even most base. For how do we proceed in the matter of writing? Do 
<A NAME="911"></A>I wish to write the name of Dion as I choose? No, but I am taught to choose 
<A NAME="912"></A>to write it as it ought to be written. And how with respect to music? In 
<A NAME="913"></A>the same manner. And what universally in every art or science? Just the 
<A NAME="914"></A>same. If it were not so, it would be of no value to know anything, if knowledge 
<A NAME="915"></A>were adapted to every man's whim. Is it, then, in this alone, in this which 
<A NAME="916"></A>is the greatest and the chief thing, I mean freedom, that I am permitted 
<A NAME="917"></A>to will inconsiderately? By no means; but to be instructed is this, to 
<A NAME="918"></A>learn to wish that everything may happen as it does. And how do things 
<A NAME="919"></A>happen? As the disposer has disposed them? And he has appointed summer 
<A NAME="920"></A>and winter, and abundance and scarcity, and virtue and vice, and all such 
<A NAME="921"></A>opposites for the harmony of the whole; and to each of us he has given 
<A NAME="922"></A>a body, and parts of the body, and possessions, and 
<A NAME="923"></A>companions.
<A NAME="924"></A><BR><BR>Remembering, then, this disposition of things we ought to go to 
<A NAME="925"></A>be instructed, not that we may change the constitution of things- for we 
<A NAME="926"></A>have not the power to do it, nor is it better that we should have the power-but 
<A NAME="927"></A>in order that, as the things around us are what they are and by nature 
<A NAME="928"></A>exist, we may maintain our minds in harmony with them things which happen. 
<A NAME="929"></A>For can we escape from men? and how is it possible? And if we associate 
<A NAME="930"></A>with them, can we chance them? Who gives us the power? What then remains, 
<A NAME="931"></A>or what method is discovered of holding commerce with them? Is there such 
<A NAME="932"></A>a method by which they shall do what seems fit to them, and we not the 
<A NAME="933"></A>less shall be in a mood which is conformable to nature? But you are unwilling 
<A NAME="934"></A>to endure and are discontented: and if you are alone, you call it solitude; 
<A NAME="935"></A>and of you are with men, you call them knaves and robbers; and you find 
<A NAME="936"></A>fault with your own parents and children, and brothers and neighbours. 
<A NAME="937"></A>But you ought when you are alone to call this condition by the name of 
<A NAME="938"></A>tranquillity and freedom, and to think yourself like to the gods; and when 
<A NAME="939"></A>you are with many, you ought not to call it crowd, nor trouble, nor uneasiness, 
<A NAME="940"></A>but festival and assembly, and so accept all contentedly.
<A NAME="941"></A><BR><BR>What, then, is the punishment of those who do not accept? It is 
<A NAME="942"></A>to be what they are. Is any person dissatisfied with being alone, let him 
<A NAME="943"></A>be alone. Is a man dissatisfied with his parents? let him be a bad son, 
<A NAME="944"></A>and lament. Is he dissatisfied with his children? let him be a bad father. 
<A NAME="945"></A>"Cast him into prison." What prison? Where he is already, for he is there 
<A NAME="946"></A>against his will; and where a man is against his will, there he is in prison. 
<A NAME="947"></A>So Socrates was not in prison, for he was there willingly. "Must my leg 
<A NAME="948"></A>then be lamed?" Wretch, do you then on account of one poor leg find fault 
<A NAME="949"></A>with the world? Will you not willingly surrender it for the whole? Will 
<A NAME="950"></A>you not withdraw from it? Will you not gladly part with it to him who gave 
<A NAME="951"></A>it? And will you be vexed and discontented with the things established 
<A NAME="952"></A>by Zeus, which he with the Moirae who were present and spinning the thread 
<A NAME="953"></A>of your generation, defined and put in order? Know you not how small a 
<A NAME="954"></A>part you are compared with the whole. I mean with respect to the body, 
<A NAME="955"></A>for as to intelligence you are not inferior to the gods nor less; for the 
<A NAME="956"></A>magnitude of intelligence is not measured by length nor yet by height, 
<A NAME="957"></A>but by thoughts.
<A NAME="958"></A><BR><BR>Will you not, then, choose to place your good in that in which 
<A NAME="959"></A>you are equal to the gods? "Wretch that I am to have such a father and 
<A NAME="960"></A>mother." What, then, was it permitted to you to come forth, and to select, 
<A NAME="961"></A>and to say: "Let such a man at this moment unite with such a woman that 
<A NAME="962"></A>I may be produced?" It was not permitted, but it was a necessity for your 
<A NAME="963"></A>parents to exist first, and then for you to be begotten. Of what kind of 
<A NAME="964"></A>parents? Of such as they were. Well then, since they are such as they are, 
<A NAME="965"></A>is there no remedy given to you? Now if you did not know for what purpose 
<A NAME="966"></A>you possess the faculty of vision, you would be unfortunate and wretched 
<A NAME="967"></A>if you closed your eyes when colors were brought before them; but in that 
<A NAME="968"></A>you possess greatness of soul and nobility of spirit for every event that 
<A NAME="969"></A>may happen, and you know not that you possess them, are you not more unfortunate 
<A NAME="970"></A>and wretched? Things are brought close to you which are proportionate to 
<A NAME="971"></A>the power which you possess, but you turn away this power most particularly 
<A NAME="972"></A>at the very time when you ought to maintain it open and discerning. Do 
<A NAME="973"></A>you not rather thank the gods that they have allowed you to be above these 
<A NAME="974"></A>things which they have not placed in your power; and have made you accountable 
<A NAME="975"></A>only for those which are in your power? As to your parents, the gods have 
<A NAME="976"></A>left you free from responsibility; and so with respect to your brothers, 
<A NAME="977"></A>and your body, and possessions, and death and life. For what, then, have 
<A NAME="978"></A>they made you responsible? For that which alone is in your power, the proper 
<A NAME="979"></A>use of appearances. Why then do you draw on yourself the things for which 
<A NAME="980"></A>you are not responsible? It is, indeed, a giving of trouble to 
<A NAME="981"></A>yourself.

<A NAME="983"></A><BR><BR>How everything may he done acceptably to the 
<A NAME="984"></A>gods
<A NAME="985"></A><BR><BR>When some one asked, how may a man eat acceptably to the gods, 
<A NAME="986"></A>he answered: If he can eat justly and contentedly, and with equanimity, 
<A NAME="987"></A>and temperately and orderly, will it not be also acceptably to the gods? 
<A NAME="988"></A>But when you have asked for warm water and the slave has not heard, or 
<A NAME="989"></A>if he did hear has brought only tepid water, or he is not even found to 
<A NAME="990"></A>be in the house, then not to be vexed or to burst with passion, is not 
<A NAME="991"></A>this acceptable to the gods? "How then shall a man endure such persons 
<A NAME="992"></A>as this slave?" Slave yourself, will you not bear with your own brother, 
<A NAME="993"></A>who has Zeus for his progenitor, and is like a son from the same seeds 
<A NAME="994"></A>and of the same descent from above? But if you have been put in any such 
<A NAME="995"></A>higher place, will you immediately make yourself a tyrant? Will you not 
<A NAME="996"></A>remember who you are, and whom you rule? that they are kinsmen, that they 
<A NAME="997"></A>are brethren by nature, that they are the offspring of Zeus? "But I have 
<A NAME="998"></A>purchased them, and they have not purchased me." Do you see in what direction 
<A NAME="999"></A>you are looking, that it is toward the earth, toward the pit, that it is 
<A NAME="1000"></A>toward these wretched laws of dead men? but toward the laws of the gods 
<A NAME="1001"></A>you are not looking.

<A NAME="1002"></A><B>Chapter 14</B>

<A NAME="1003"></A><BR><BR>That the deity oversees all things
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR><BR>When a person asked him how a man could be convinced that all his 
<A NAME="1005"></A>actions are under the inspection of God, he answered, Do you not think 
<A NAME="1006"></A>that all things are united in one? "I do," the person replied. Well, do 
<A NAME="1007"></A>you not think that earthly things have a natural agreement and union with 
<A NAME="1008"></A>heavenly things "I do." And how else so regularly as if by God's command, 
<A NAME="1009"></A>when He bids the plants to flower, do they flower? when He bids them to 
<A NAME="1010"></A>send forth shoots, do they shoot? when He bids them to produce fruit, how 
<A NAME="1011"></A>else do they produce fruit? when He bids the fruit to ripen, does it ripen? 
<A NAME="1012"></A>when again He bids them to cast down the fruits, how else do they cast 
<A NAME="1013"></A>them down? and when to shed the leaves, do they shed the leaves? and when 
<A NAME="1014"></A>He bids them to fold themselves up and to remain quiet and rest, how else 
<A NAME="1015"></A>do they remain quiet and rest? And how else at the growth and the wane 
<A NAME="1016"></A>of the moon, and at the approach and recession of the sun, are so great 
<A NAME="1017"></A>an alteration and change to the contrary seen in earthly things? But are 
<A NAME="1018"></A>plants and our bodies so bound up and united with the whole, and are not 
<A NAME="1019"></A>our souls much more? and our souls so bound up and in contact with God 
<A NAME="1020"></A>as parts of Him and portions of Him; and does not God perceive every motion 
<A NAME="1021"></A>of these parts as being His own motion connate with Himself? Now are you 
<A NAME="1022"></A>able to think of the divine administration, and about all things divine, 
<A NAME="1023"></A>and at the same time also about human affairs, and to be moved by ten thousand 
<A NAME="1024"></A>things at the same time in your senses and in your understanding, and to 
<A NAME="1025"></A>assent to some, and to dissent from others, and again as to some things 
<A NAME="1026"></A>to suspend your judgment; and do you retain in your soul so many impressions 
<A NAME="1027"></A>from so many and various things, and being moved by them, do you fall upon 
<A NAME="1028"></A>notions similar to those first impressed, and do you retain numerous arts 
<A NAME="1029"></A>and the memories of ten thousand things; and is not God able to oversee 
<A NAME="1030"></A>all things, and to be present with all, and to receive from all a certain 
<A NAME="1031"></A>communication? And is the sun able to illuminate so large a part of the 
<A NAME="1032"></A>All, and to leave so little not illuminated, that part only which is occupied 
<A NAME="1033"></A>by the earth's shadow; and He who made the sun itself and makes it go round, 
<A NAME="1034"></A>being a small part of Himself compared with the whole, cannot He perceive 
<A NAME="1035"></A>all things?
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR><BR>"But I cannot," the man may reply, "comprehend all these things 
<A NAME="1037"></A>at once." But who tells you that you have equal power with Zeus? Nevertheless 
<A NAME="1038"></A>he has placed by every man a guardian, every man's Demon, to whom he has 
<A NAME="1039"></A>committed the care of the man, a guardian who never sleeps, is never deceived. 
<A NAME="1040"></A>For to what better and more careful guardian could He have entrusted each 
<A NAME="1041"></A>of us? When, then, you have shut the doors and made darkness within, remember 
<A NAME="1042"></A>never to say that you are alone, for you are not; but God is within, and 
<A NAME="1043"></A>your Demon is within, and what need have they of light to see what you 
<A NAME="1044"></A>are doing? To this God you ought to swear an oath just as the soldiers 
<A NAME="1045"></A>do to Caesar. But they who are hired for pay swear to regard the safety 
<A NAME="1046"></A>of Caesar before all things; and you who have received so many and such 
<A NAME="1047"></A>great favours, will you not swear, or when you have sworn, will you not 
<A NAME="1048"></A>abide by your oath? And what shall you swear? Never to be disobedient, 
<A NAME="1049"></A>never to make any charges, never to find fault with anything that he has 
<A NAME="1050"></A>given, and never unwillingly to do or to suffer anything, that is necessary. 
<A NAME="1051"></A>Is this oath like the soldier's oath? The soldiers swear not to prefer 
<A NAME="1052"></A>any man to Caesar: in this oath men swear to honour themselves before 
<A NAME="1053"></A>all.

<A NAME="1055"></A><BR><BR>What philosophy promises
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR><BR>When a man was consulting him how he should persuade his brother 
<A NAME="1057"></A>to cease being angry with him, Epictetus replied: Philosophy does not propose 
<A NAME="1058"></A>to secure for a man any external thing. If it did philosophy would be allowing 
<A NAME="1059"></A>something which is not within its province. For as the carpenter's material 
<A NAME="1060"></A>is wood, and that of the statuary is copper, so the matter of the art of 
<A NAME="1061"></A>living is each man's life. "What then is my brother's?" That again belongs 
<A NAME="1062"></A>to his own art; but with respect to yours, it is one of the external things, 
<A NAME="1063"></A>like a piece of land, like health, like reputation. But Philosophy promises 
<A NAME="1064"></A>none of these. "In every circumstance I will maintain," she says, "the 
<A NAME="1065"></A>governing part conformable to nature." Whose governing part? "His in whom 
<A NAME="1066"></A>I am," she says.
<A NAME="1067"></A><BR><BR>"How then shall my brother cease to be angry with me?" Bring him 
<A NAME="1068"></A>to me and I will tell him. But I have nothing to say to you about his 
<A NAME="1069"></A>anger.
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR><BR>When the man, who was consulting him, said, "I seek to know this- 
<A NAME="1071"></A>how, even if my brother is not reconciled to me, shall I maintain myself 
<A NAME="1072"></A>in a state conformable to nature?" Nothing great, said Epictetus, is produced 
<A NAME="1073"></A>suddenly, since not even the grape or the fig is. If you say to me now 
<A NAME="1074"></A>that you want a fig, I will answer to you that it requires time: let it 
<A NAME="1075"></A>flower first, then put forth fruit, and then ripen. Is, then, the fruit 
<A NAME="1076"></A>of a fig-tree not perfected suddenly and in one hour, and would you possess 
<A NAME="1077"></A>the fruit of a man's mind in so short a time and so easily? Do not expect 
<A NAME="1078"></A>it, even if I tell you.

<A NAME="1080"></A><BR><BR>Of providence
<A NAME="1081"></A><BR><BR>Do not wonder if for other animals than man all things are provided 
<A NAME="1082"></A>for the body, not only food and drink, but beds also, and they have no 
<A NAME="1083"></A>need of shoes nor bed materials, nor clothing; but we require all these

<A NAME="1085"></A>service, it was not fit for them to he made so as to need other things. 
<A NAME="1086"></A>For consider what it would be for us to take care not only of ourselves,
