<A NAME="10"></A><B>I</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Are these the only works of Providence within us? What words suffice to 
<A NAME="12"></A>praise or set them forth? Had we but understanding, should we ever cease 
<A NAME="13"></A>hymning and blessing the Divine Power, both openly and in secret, and telling 
<A NAME="14"></A>of His gracious gifts? Whether digging or ploughing or eating, should we 
<A NAME="15"></A>not sing the hymn to God:-- Great is God, for that He hath given us such 
<A NAME="16"></A>instruments to till the ground withal: Great is God, for that He hath given 
<A NAME="17"></A>us hands and the power of swallowing and digesting; of unconsciously growing 
<A NAME="18"></A>and breathing while we sleep! Thus should we ever have sung; yea and this, 
<A NAME="19"></A>the grandest and divinest hymn of all:-- Great is God, for that He hath 
<A NAME="20"></A>given us a mind to apprehend these things, and duly to use them! What then! 
<A NAME="21"></A>seeing that most of you are blinded, should there not be some one to fill 
<A NAME="22"></A>this place, and sing the hymn to God on behalf of all men? What else can 
<A NAME="23"></A>I that am old and lame do but sing to God? Were I a nightingale, I should 
<A NAME="24"></A>do after the manner of a nightingale. Were I a swan, I should do after 
<A NAME="25"></A>the manner of a swan. But now, since I am a reasonable being, I must sing 
<A NAME="26"></A>to God: that is my work: I do it, nor will I desert this my post, as long 
<A NAME="27"></A>as it is granted me to hold it; and upon you too I call to join in this 
<A NAME="28"></A>self-same hymn.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="29"></A><B>II</B>

<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>How then do men act? As though one returning to his country who 
<A NAME="31"></A>had sojourned for the night in a fair inn, should be so captivated thereby 
<A NAME="32"></A>as to take up his abode there. "Friend, thou hast forgotten thine intention! 
<A NAME="33"></A>This was not thy destination, but only lay on the way thither." "Nay, but 
<A NAME="34"></A>it is a proper place." "And how many more of the sort there may be; only 
<A NAME="35"></A>to pass through upon thy way! Thy purpose was to return to thy country; 
<A NAME="36"></A>to relieve thy kinsmen's fears for thee; thyself to discharge the duties 
<A NAME="37"></A>of a citizen; to marry a wife, to beget offspring, and to fill the appointed 
<A NAME="38"></A>round of office. Thou didst not come to choose out what places are most 
<A NAME="39"></A>pleasant; but rather to return to that wherein thou wast born and where 
<A NAME="40"></A>wert appointed to ba a citizen."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="41"></A><B>III</B>

<A NAME="42"></A><BR><BR>Try to enjoy the great festival of life with other 
<A NAME="43"></A>men.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="44"></A><B>IV</B>

<A NAME="45"></A><BR><BR>But I have one whom I must please, to whom I must be subject, whom 
<A NAME="46"></A>I must obey:-- God, and those who come next to Him. He hath entrusted me 
<A NAME="47"></A>with myself: He hath made my will subject to myself alone and given me 
<A NAME="48"></A>rules for the right use thereof.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="49"></A><B>V</B>

<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR>Rufus used to say, If you have leisure to praise me, what I say 
<A NAME="51"></A>is naught. In truth he spoke in such wise, that each of us who sat there, 
<A NAME="52"></A>though that some one had accused him to Rufus:-- so surely did he lay his 
<A NAME="53"></A>finger on the very deeds we did: so surely display the faults of each before 
<A NAME="54"></A>his very eyes.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="55"></A><B>VI</B>

<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR>But what saith God?-- "Had it been possible, Epictetus, I would 
<A NAME="57"></A>have made both that body of thine and thy possessions free and unimpeded, 
<A NAME="58"></A>but as it is, be not deceived:-- it is not thine own; it is but finely 
<A NAME="59"></A>tempered clay. Since then this I could not do, I have given thee a portion 
<A NAME="60"></A>of Myself, in the power of desiring and declining and of pursuing and avoiding, 
<A NAME="61"></A>and is a word the power of dealing with the things of sense. And if thou 
<A NAME="62"></A>neglect not this, but place all that thou hast therein, thou shalt never 
<A NAME="63"></A>be let or hindered; thou shalt never lament; thou shalt not blame or flatter 
<A NAME="64"></A>any. What then? Seemth this to thee a little thing?"--God forbid!--"Be 
<A NAME="65"></A>content then therewith!" And so I pray the Gods.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="66"></A><B>VII</B>

<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR>What saith Antisthenes? Hast thou never heard?-- It is a kingly 
<A NAME="68"></A>thing, O Cyrus, to do well and to be evil spoken of.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="69"></A><B>VIII</B>

<A NAME="70"></A><BR><BR>"Aye, but to debase myself thus were unworthy of me." "That," said 
<A NAME="71"></A>Epictetus, "is for you to consider, not for me. You know yourself what 
<A NAME="72"></A>you are worth in your own eyes; and at what price you will sell yourself. 
<A NAME="73"></A>For men sell themselves at various prices. This was why, when Florus was 
<A NAME="74"></A>deliberating whether he should appear at Nero's shows, taking part in the 
<A NAME="75"></A>performance himself, Agrippinus replied, 'But why do not you appear?' he 
<A NAME="76"></A>answered, 'Because I do not even consider the question.' For the man who 
<A NAME="77"></A>has once stooped to consider such questions, and to reckon up the value 
<A NAME="78"></A>of external things, is not far from forgetting what manner of man he is. 
<A NAME="79"></A>Why, what is it that you ask me? Is death preferable, or life? I reply, 
<A NAME="80"></A>Life. Pain or pleasure? I reply, Pleasure." "Well, but if I do not act, 
<A NAME="81"></A>I shall lose my head." "Then go and act! But for my part I will not act." 
<A NAME="82"></A>"Why?" "Because you think yourself but one among the many threads which 
<A NAME="83"></A>make up the texture of the doublet. You should aim at being like men in 
<A NAME="84"></A>general--just as your thread has no ambition either to be anything distinguished 
<A NAME="85"></A>compared with the other threads. But I desire to be the purple--that small 
<A NAME="86"></A>and shining part which makes the rest seem fair and beautiful. Why then 
<A NAME="87"></A>do you bid me become even as the multitude? Then were I no longer the 
<A NAME="88"></A>purple."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="89"></A><B>IX</B>

<A NAME="90"></A><BR><BR>If a man could be throughly penetrated, as he ought, with this 
<A NAME="91"></A>thought, that we are all in an especial manner sprung from God, and that 
<A NAME="92"></A>God is the Father of men as well as of Gods, full surely he would never 
<A NAME="93"></A>conceive aught ignoble or base of himself. Whereas if Caesar were to adopt 
<A NAME="94"></A>you, your haughty looks would be intolerable; will you not be elated at 
<A NAME="95"></A>knowing that you are the son of God? Now however it is not so with us: 
<A NAME="96"></A>but seeing that in our birth these two things are commingled--the body 
<A NAME="97"></A>which we share with the animals, and the Reason and Thought which we share 
<A NAME="98"></A>with the Gods, many decline towards this unhappy kinship with the dead, 
<A NAME="99"></A>few rise to the blessed kinship with the Divine. Since then every one must 
<A NAME="100"></A>deal with each thing according to the view which he forms about it, those 
<A NAME="101"></A>few who hold that they are born for fidelity, modesty, and unerring sureness 
<A NAME="102"></A>in dealing with the things of sense, never conceive aught base or ignoble 
<A NAME="103"></A>of themselves: but the multitude the contrary. Why, what am I?--A wretched 
<A NAME="104"></A>human creature; with this miserable flesh of mine. Miserable indeed! but 
<A NAME="105"></A>you have something better than that paltry flesh of yours. Why then cling 
<A NAME="106"></A>to the one, and neglect the other?
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="107"></A><B>X</B>

<A NAME="108"></A><BR><BR>Thou art but a poor soul laden with a lifeless 
<A NAME="109"></A>body.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="110"></A><B>XI</B>

<A NAME="111"></A><BR><BR>The other day I had an iron lamp placed beside my household gods. 
<A NAME="112"></A>I heard a noise at the door and on hastening down found my lamp carried 
<A NAME="113"></A>off. I reflected that the culprit was in no very strange case. "Tomorrow, 
<A NAME="114"></A>my friend," I said, "you will find an earthenware lamp; for a man can only 
<A NAME="115"></A>lose what he has."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="116"></A><B>XII</B>

<A NAME="117"></A><BR><BR>The reason why I lost my lamp was that the thief was superior to 
<A NAME="118"></A>me in vigilance. He paid however this price for the lamp, that in exchange 
<A NAME="119"></A>for it he consented to become a thief: in exchange for it, to become 
<A NAME="120"></A>faithless.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="121"></A><B>XIII</B>

<A NAME="122"></A><BR><BR>But God hath introduced Man to be a spectator of Himself and of 
<A NAME="123"></A>His works; and not a spectator only, but also an interpreter of them. Wherefore 
<A NAME="124"></A>it is a shame for man to begin and to leave off where the brutes do. Rather 
<A NAME="125"></A>he should begin there, and leave off where Nature leaves off in us: and 
<A NAME="126"></A>that is at contemplation, and understanding, and a manner of life that 
<A NAME="127"></A>is in harmony with herself. See then that ye die not without being spectators 
<A NAME="128"></A>of these things.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="129"></A><B>XIV</B>

<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR>You journey to Olympia to see the work of Phidias; and each of 
<A NAME="131"></A>you holds it a misfortune not to have beheld these things before you die. 
<A NAME="132"></A>Whereas when there is no need even to take a journey, but you are on the 
<A NAME="133"></A>spot, with the works before you, have you no care to contemplate and study 
<A NAME="134"></A>these? Will you not then perceive either who you are or unto what end you 
<A NAME="135"></A>were born: or for what purpose the power of contemplation has been bestowed 
<A NAME="136"></A>on you? "Well, but in life there are some things disagreeable and hard 
<A NAME="137"></A>to bear." And are there none at Olympia? Are you not scorched by the heat? 
<A NAME="138"></A>Are you not cramped for room? Have you not to bathe with discomfort? Are 
<A NAME="139"></A>you not drenched when it rains? Have you not to endure the clamor and shouting 
<A NAME="140"></A>and such annoyances as these? Well, I suppose you set all this over against 
<A NAME="141"></A>the splendour of the spectacle and bear it patiently. What then? have you 
<A NAME="142"></A>not received greatness of heart, received courage, received fortitude? 
<A NAME="143"></A>What care I, if I am great of heart, for aught that can come to pass? What 
<A NAME="144"></A>shall cast me down or disturb me? What shall seem painful? Shall I not 
<A NAME="145"></A>use the power to the end for which I received it, instead of moaning and 
<A NAME="146"></A>wailing over what comes to pass?
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="147"></A><B>XV</B>

<A NAME="148"></A><BR><BR>If what philosophers say of the kinship of God and Man be true, 
<A NAME="149"></A>what remains for men to do but as Socrates did:--never, when asked one's 
<A NAME="150"></A>country, to answer, "I am an Athenian or a Corinthian," but "I am a citizen 
<A NAME="151"></A>of the world."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="152"></A><B>XVI</B>

<A NAME="153"></A><BR><BR>He that hath grasped the administration of the World, who hath 
<A NAME="154"></A>learned that this Community, which consists of God and men, is the foremost 
<A NAME="155"></A>and mightiest and most comprehensive of all:-- that from God have descended 
<A NAME="156"></A>the germs of life, not to my father only and father's father, but to all 
<A NAME="157"></A>things that are born and grow upon the earth, and in an especial manner 
<A NAME="158"></A>to those endowed with Reason (for those only are by their nature fitted 
<A NAME="159"></A>to hold communion with God, being by means of Reason conjoined with Him) 
<A NAME="160"></A>--why should not such an one call himself a citizen of the world? Why not 
<A NAME="161"></A>a son of God? Why should he fear aught that comes to pass among men? Shall 
<A NAME="162"></A>kinship with Caesar, or any other of the great at Rome, be enough to hedge 
<A NAME="163"></A>men around with safety and consideration, without a thought of apprehension: 
<A NAME="164"></A>while to have God for our Maker, and Father, and Kinsman, shall not this 
<A NAME="165"></A>set us free from sorrows and fears?
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="166"></A><B>XVII</B>

<A NAME="167"></A><BR><BR>I do not think that an old fellow like me need have been sitting 
<A NAME="168"></A>here to try and prevent your entertaining abject notions of yourselves, 
<A NAME="169"></A>and talking of yourselves in an abject and ignoble way: but to prevent 
<A NAME="170"></A>there being by chance among you any such young men as, after recognising 
<A NAME="171"></A>their kindred to the Gods, and their bondage in these chains of the body 
<A NAME="172"></A>and its manifold necessities, should desire to cast them off as burdens 
<A NAME="173"></A>too grievous to be borne, and depart their true kindred. This is the struggle 
<A NAME="174"></A>in which your Master and Teacher, were he worthy of the name, should be 
<A NAME="175"></A>engaged. You would come to me and say: "Epictetus, we can no longer endure 
<A NAME="176"></A>being chained to this wretched body, giving food and drink and rest and 
<A NAME="177"></A>purification: aye, and for its sake forced to be subservient to this man 
<A NAME="178"></A>and that. Are these not things indifferent and nothing to us? Is it not 
<A NAME="179"></A>true that death is no evil? Are we not in a manner kinsmen of the Gods, 
<A NAME="180"></A>and have we not come from them? Let us depart thither, whence we came: 
<A NAME="181"></A>let us be freed from these chains that confine and press us down. Here 
<A NAME="182"></A>are thieves and robbers and tribunals: and they that are called tyrants, 
<A NAME="183"></A>who deem that they have after a fashion power over us, because of the miserable 
<A NAME="184"></A>body and what appertains to it. Let us show them that they have power over 
<A NAME="185"></A>none."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="186"></A><B>XVIII</B>

<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR>And to this I reply:-- "Friends, wait for God. When He gives the 
<A NAME="188"></A>signal, and releases you from this service, then depart to Him. But for 
<A NAME="189"></A>the present, endure to dwell in the place wherein He hath assigned you 
<A NAME="190"></A>your post. Short indeed is the time of your habitation therein, and easy 
<A NAME="191"></A>to those that are minded. What tyrant, what robber, what tribunals have 
<A NAME="192"></A>any terrors for those who thus esteem the body and all that belong to it 
<A NAME="193"></A>as of no account? Stay; depart not rashly hence!"
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="194"></A><B>XIX</B>

<A NAME="195"></A><BR><BR>Something like that is what should pass between a teacher and ingenuous 
<A NAME="196"></A>youths. As it is, what does pass? The teacher is a lifeless body, and you 
<A NAME="197"></A>are lifeless bodies yourselves. When you have had enough to eat today, 
<A NAME="198"></A>you sit down and weep about tomorrow's food. Slave! if you have it, well 
<A NAME="199"></A>and good; if not, you will depart: the door is open--why lament? What further 
<A NAME="200"></A>room is there for tears? What further occasion for flattery? Why should 
<A NAME="201"></A>one envy another? Why should you stand in awe of them that have much or 
<A NAME="202"></A>are placed in power, especially if they be also strong and passionate? 
<A NAME="203"></A>Why, what should they do to us? What they can do, we will not regard: what 
<A NAME="204"></A>does concern us, that they cannot do. Who then shall rule one that is thus 
<A NAME="205"></A>minded?
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="206"></A><B>XX</B>

<A NAME="207"></A><BR><BR>Seeing this then, and noting well the faculties which you have, 
<A NAME="208"></A>you should say,--"Send now, O God, any trial that Thou wilt; lo, I have 
<A NAME="209"></A>means and powers given me by Thee to acquit myself with honour through 
<A NAME="210"></A>whatever comes to pass!"-- No; but there you sit, trembling for fear certain 
<A NAME="211"></A>things should come to pass, and moaning and groaning and lamenting over 
<A NAME="212"></A>what does come to pass. And then you upbraid the Gods. Such meanness of 
<A NAME="213"></A>spirit can have but one result--impiety. Yet God has not only given us 
<A NAME="214"></A>these faculties by means of which we may bear everything that comes to 
<A NAME="215"></A>pass without being curshed or depressed thereby; but like a good King and 
<A NAME="216"></A>Father, He has given us this without let or hindrance, placed wholly at 
<A NAME="217"></A>our own disposition, without reserving to Himself any power of impediment 
<A NAME="218"></A>or restraint. Though possessing all these things free and all you own, 
<A NAME="219"></A>you do not use them! you do not perceive what it is you have received nor 
<A NAME="220"></A>whence it comes, but sit moaning and groaning; some of you blind to the 
<A NAME="221"></A>Giver, making no acknowledgment to your Benefactor; others basely giving 
<A NAME="222"></A>themselves to complaints and accusations against God. Yet what faculties 
<A NAME="223"></A>and powers you possess for attaining courage and greatness of heart, I 
<A NAME="224"></A>can easily show you; what you have for upbraiding and accusation, it is 
<A NAME="225"></A>for you to show me!
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="226"></A><B>XXI</B>

<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR>How did Socrates bear himself in this regard? How else than as 
<A NAME="228"></A>became one who was fully assured that he was the kinsman of 
<A NAME="229"></A>Gods?
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="230"></A><B>XXII</B>

<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR>If God had made that part of His own nature which He severed from 
<A NAME="232"></A>Himself and gave to us, liable to be hindered or constrained either by 
<A NAME="233"></A>Himself or any other, He would not have been God, nor would He have been 
<A NAME="234"></A>taking care of us as He ought . . . . If you choose, you are free; if you 
<A NAME="235"></A>choose, you need blame no man-- accuse no man. All things will be at once 
<A NAME="236"></A>according to your mind and according to the Mind of 
<A NAME="237"></A>God.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="238"></A><B>XXIII</B>

<A NAME="239"></A><BR><BR>Petrifaction is of two sorts. There is petrifaction of the understanding; 
<A NAME="240"></A>and also of the sense of shame. This happens when a man obstinately refuses 
<A NAME="241"></A>to acknowledge plain truths, and persists in maintaining what is self-contradictory. 
<A NAME="242"></A>Most of us dread mortification of the body, and would spare no pains to 
<A NAME="243"></A>escape anything of that kind. But of mortification of the soul we are utterly 
<A NAME="244"></A>heedless. With regard, indeed, to the soul, if a man is in such a state 
<A NAME="245"></A>as to be incapable of following or understanding anything, I grant you 
<A NAME="246"></A>we do think him in a bad way. But mortification of the sense of shame and 
<A NAME="247"></A>modesty we go so far as to dub strength of mind!

<A NAME="249"></A><BR><BR>If we were as intent upon our business as the old fellows at Rome 
<A NAME="250"></A>are upon what interests them, we too might perhaps accomplish something. 
<A NAME="251"></A>I know a man older than I am, now Superintendent of the Corn-market at 
<A NAME="252"></A>Rome, and I remember when he passed through this place on his way back 
<A NAME="253"></A>from exile, what an account he gave me of his former life, declaring that 
<A NAME="254"></A>for the future, once home again, his only care should be to pass his remaining 
<A NAME="255"></A>years in quiet and tranquility. "For how few years have I left!" he cried. 
<A NAME="256"></A>"That," I said, "you will not do; but the moment the scent of Rome is in 
<A NAME="257"></A>your nostrils, you will forget it all; and if you can but gain admission 
<A NAME="258"></A>to Court, you will be glad enough to elbow your way in, and thank God for 
<A NAME="259"></A>it." "Epictetus," he replied, "if ever you find me setting as much as one 
<A NAME="260"></A>foot within the Court, think what you will of me." Well, as it was, what 
<A NAME="261"></A>did he do? Ere ever he entered the city, he was met by a despatch from 
<A NAME="262"></A>the Emperor. He took it, and forgot the whole of his resolutions. From 
<A NAME="263"></A>that moment, he has been piling one thing upon another. I should like to 
<A NAME="264"></A>be beside him to remind him of what he said when passing this way, and 
<A NAME="265"></A>to add, How much better a prophet I am than you! What then? do I say man 
<A NAME="266"></A>is not made for an active life? Far from it! . . . But there is a great 
<A NAME="267"></A>difference between other men's occupations and ours. . . . A glance at 
<A NAME="268"></A>theirs will make it clear to you. All day long they do nothing but calculate, 
<A NAME="269"></A>contrive, consult how to wring their profit out of food-stuffs, farm-plots 
<A NAME="270"></A>and the like. . . . Whereas, I entreat you to learn what the administration 
<A NAME="271"></A>of the World is, and what place a Being endowed with reason holds therein: 
<A NAME="272"></A>to consider what you are yourself, and wherein your Good and Evil 
<A NAME="273"></A>consists.

<A NAME="275"></A><BR><BR>A man asked me to write to Rome on his behalf who, as most people 
<A NAME="276"></A>thought, had met with misfortune; for having been before wealthy and distinguished, 
<A NAME="277"></A>he had afterwards lost all and was living here. So I wrote about him in 
<A NAME="278"></A>a humble style. He however on reading the letter returned it to me, with 
<A NAME="279"></A>the words: "I asked for your help, not for your pity. No evil has happened 
<A NAME="280"></A>unto me."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="281"></A><B>XXVI</B>

<A NAME="282"></A><BR><BR>True instruction is this:-- to learn to wish that each thing should 
<A NAME="283"></A>come to pass as it does. And how does it come to pass? As the Disposer 
<A NAME="284"></A>has disposed it. Now He has disposed that there should be summer and winter, 
<A NAME="285"></A>and plenty and dearth, and vice and virtue, and all such opposites, for 
<A NAME="286"></A>the harmony of the whole.

<A NAME="287"></A><B>XXVII</B>

<A NAME="288"></A><BR><BR>Have this thought ever present with thee, when thou losest any 
<A NAME="289"></A>outward thing, what thou gainest in its stead; and if this be the more 
<A NAME="290"></A>precious, say not, I have suffered loss.

<A NAME="291"></A><B>XXVIII</B>

<A NAME="292"></A><BR><BR>Concerning the Gods, there are who deny the very existence of the 
<A NAME="293"></A>Godhead; others say that it exists, but neither bestirs nor concerns itself 
<A NAME="294"></A>norhas forethought for anything. A third party attribute to it existence 
<A NAME="295"></A>and forethought, but only for great and heavenly matters, not for anything 
<A NAME="296"></A>that is on earth. A fourth party admit things on earth as well as in heaven, 
<A NAME="297"></A>but only in general, and not with respect to each individual. A fifth, 
<A NAME="298"></A>of whom were Ulysses and Socrates are those that cry:-- I move not without 
<A NAME="299"></A>Thy knowledge!
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="300"></A><B>XXIX</B>

<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR>Considering all these things, the good and true man submits his 
<A NAME="302"></A>judgement to Him that administers the Universe, even as good citizens to 
<A NAME="303"></A>the law of the State. And he that is being instructed should come thus 
<A NAME="304"></A>minded:--How may I in all things follow the Gods; and, How may I rest satisfied 
<A NAME="305"></A>with the Divine Administration; and, How may I become free? For he is free 
<A NAME="306"></A>for whom all things come to pass according to his will, and whom none can 
<A NAME="307"></A>hinder. What then, is freedom madness? God forbid. For madness and freedom 
<A NAME="308"></A>exist not together. "But I wish all that I desire to come to pass and in 
<A NAME="309"></A>the manner that I desire." --You are mad, you are beside yourself. Know 
<A NAME="310"></A>you not that Freedom is a glorious thing and of great worth? But that what 
<A NAME="311"></A>I desired at random I should wish at random to come to pass, so far from 
<A NAME="312"></A>being noble, may well be exceeding base.

<A NAME="314"></A><BR><BR>You must know that it is no easy thing for a principle to become

<A NAME="322"></A><BR><BR>What then is the chastisement of those who accept it not? To be

<A NAME="324"></A>Is any discontented with his parents? let him be a bad son, and lament. 
<A NAME="325"></A>Is any discontented with his children? let him be a bad father.--"Throw 
<A NAME="326"></A>him into prision!"--What prision?-- Where he is already: for he is there 
<A NAME="327"></A>against his will; and wherever a man is against his will, that to him is 
<A NAME="328"></A>a prision. Thus Socrates was not in prision, since he was there with his 
<A NAME="329"></A>own consent.

<A NAME="331"></A><BR><BR>Knowest thou what a speck thou art in comparison with the Universe?---That 
<A NAME="332"></A>is, with respect to the body; since with respect to Reason, thou art not 
<A NAME="333"></A>inferior to the Gods, nor less than they. For the greatness of Reason is 
<A NAME="334"></A>not measured by length or height, but by the resolves of the mind. Place 
<A NAME="335"></A>then thy happiness in that wherein thou art equal to the 
<A NAME="336"></A>Gods.

<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR>Asked how a man might eat acceptably to the Gods, Epictetus replied:--If 
<A NAME="339"></A>when he eats, he can be just, cheerful, equable, temperate, and orderly, 
<A NAME="340"></A>can he not thus eat acceptably to the Gods? But when you call for warm 
<A NAME="341"></A>water, and your slave does not answer, or when he answers brings it lukewarm, 
<A NAME="342"></A>or is not even found to be in the house at all, then not to be vexed nor 
<A NAME="343"></A>burst with anger, is not that acceptable to the Gods? "But how can one 
<A NAME="344"></A>endure such people?" Slave, will you not endure your own brother, that 
<A NAME="345"></A>has God to his forefather, even as a son sprung from the same stock, and 
<A NAME="346"></A>of the same high descent as yourself? And if you are stationed in a high 
<A NAME="347"></A>position, are you therefor forthwith set up for a tyrant? Remember who 
<A NAME="348"></A>you are, and whom you rule, that they are by nature your kinsmen, your 
<A NAME="349"></A>brothers, the offspring of God. "But I paid a price for them, not they 
<A NAME="350"></A>for me." Do you see whither you are looking--down to the earth, to the 
<A NAME="351"></A>pit, to those despicable laws of the dead? But to the laws of the Gods 
<A NAME="352"></A>you do not look.

<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR>When we are invited to a banquet, we take what is set before us; 
<A NAME="355"></A>and were one to call upon his host to set fish upon the table or sweet 
<A NAME="356"></A>things, he would be deemed absurd. Yet in a word, we ask the Gods for what 
<A NAME="357"></A>they do not give; and that, although they have given us so many 
<A NAME="358"></A>things!

<A NAME="359"></A><B>XXXVI</B>

<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR>Asked how a man might convince himself that every single act of 
<A NAME="361"></A>his was under the eye of God, Epictetus answered:-- "Do you not hold that 
<A NAME="362"></A>things on earth and things in heaven are continuous and in unison with 
<A NAME="363"></A>each other?" "I do," was the reply. "Else how should the trees so regularly, 
<A NAME="364"></A>as though by God's command, at His bidding flower; at His bidding send 
<A NAME="365"></A>forth shoots, bear fruit and ripen it; at His bidding let it fall and shed 
<A NAME="366"></A>their leaves, and folded up upon themselves lie in quietness and rest? 
<A NAME="367"></A>How else, as the Moon waxes and wanes, as the Sun approaches and recedes, 
<A NAME="368"></A>can it be that such vicissitude and alternation is seen in earthly things? 
<A NAME="369"></A>"If then all things that grow, nay, our own bodies, are thus bound up with 
<A NAME="370"></A>the whole, is not this still truer of our souls? And if our souls are bound 
<A NAME="371"></A>up and in contact with God, as being very parts and fragments plucked from 
<A NAME="372"></A>Himself, shall He not feel every movement of theirs as though it were His 
<A NAME="373"></A>own, and belonging to His own nature?"
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="374"></A><B>XXXVII</B>

<A NAME="375"></A><BR><BR>"But," you say, "I cannot comprehend all this at once." "Why, who 
<A NAME="376"></A>told you that your powers were equal to God's?" Yet God hath placed by 
<A NAME="377"></A>the side of each a man's own Guardian Spirit, who is charged to watch over 
<A NAME="378"></A>him--a Guardian who sleeps not nor is deceived. For to what better or more 
<A NAME="379"></A>watchful Guardian could He have committed wach of us? So when you have 
<A NAME="380"></A>shut the doors and made a darkness within, remember never to say that you 
<A NAME="381"></A>are alone; for you are not alone, but God is within, and your Guardian 
<A NAME="382"></A>Spirit, and what light do they need to behold what you do? To this God 
<A NAME="383"></A>you also should have sworn allegiance, even as soliders unto Caesar. They, 
<A NAME="384"></A>when their service is hired, swear to hold the life of Caesar dearer than 
<A NAME="385"></A>all else: and will you not swear your oath, that are deemed worthy of so 
<A NAME="386"></A>many and great gifts? And will you not keep your oath when you have sworn 
<A NAME="387"></A>it? And what oath will you swear? Never to disobey, never to arraign or 
<A NAME="388"></A>murmur at aught that comes to you from His hand: never unwillingly to do 
<A NAME="389"></A>or suffer aught that necessity lays upon you. "Is this oath like theirs?" 
<A NAME="390"></A>They swear to hold no other dearer than Caesar: you, to hold our true selves 
<A NAME="391"></A>dearer than all else beside.

<A NAME="397"></A><BR><BR>When one took counsel of Epictetus, saying, "What I seek is this, 
<A NAME="398"></A>how even though my brother be not reconciled to me, I may still remain 
<A NAME="399"></A>as Nature would have me to be," he replied: "All great things are slow 
<A NAME="400"></A>of growth; nay, this is true even of a grape or of a fig. If then you say 
<A NAME="401"></A>to me now, I desire a fig, I shall answer, It needs time: wait till it 
<A NAME="402"></A>first flower, then cast its blossom, then ripen. Whereas then the fruit 
<A NAME="403"></A>of the fig-tree reaches not maturity suddenly nor yet in a single hour, 
<A NAME="404"></A>do you nevertheless desire so quickly, and easily to reap the fruit of

<A NAME="410"></A>men, and became a shoemaker to Caesar. You should have seen what respect 
<A NAME="411"></A>Epaphroditus paid him then. "How does the good Felicion? Kindly let me 
<A NAME="412"></A>know!" And if any of us inquired, "What is Epaphroditus doing?" the answer 
<A NAME="413"></A>was, "He is consulting about so and so with Felicion."-- Had he not sold 
<A NAME="414"></A>him as good-for-nothing? Who had in a trice converted him into a wiseacre?

<A NAME="537"></A><BR><BR>"Anytus and Melitus may put me to death: to injure me is beyond 
<A NAME="538"></A>their power."
<A NAME="539"></A><BR><BR>And again:--
<A NAME="540"></A><BR><BR>"If such be the will of God, so let it be."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="541"></A><B>LIII</B>

<A NAME="542"></A><BR><BR>Nay, young man, for heaven's sake; but once thou hast heard these 
<A NAME="543"></A>words, go home and say to thyself:--"It is not Epictetus that has told 
<A NAME="544"></A>me these things: how indeed should he? No, it is some gracious God through 
<A NAME="545"></A>him. Else it would never have entered his head to tell me them--he that 
<A NAME="546"></A>is not used to speak to any one thus. Well, then, let us not lie under 
<A NAME="547"></A>the wrath of God, but be obedient unto Him."---Nay, indeed; but if a raven 
<A NAME="548"></A>by its croaking bears thee any sign, it is not the raven but God that sends 
<A NAME="549"></A>the sign through the raven; and if He signifies anything to thee through 
<A NAME="550"></A>human voice, will He not cause the man to say these words to thee, that 
<A NAME="551"></A>thou mayest know the power of the Divine-- how He sends a sign to some 
<A NAME="552"></A>in one way and to others in another, and on the greatest and highest matters 
<A NAME="553"></A>of all signifies His will through the noblest messenger?
<A NAME="554"></A><BR><BR>What else does the poet mean:--
<A NAME="555"></A><BR><BR>I spake unto him erst Myself, and sent
<A NAME="556"></A><BR><BR>Hermes the shining One, to check and warn him,
<A NAME="557"></A><BR><BR>The husband not to slay, nor woo the wife!
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="558"></A><B>LIV</B>

<A NAME="559"></A><BR><BR>In the same way my friend Heraclitus, who had a trifling suit about 
<A NAME="560"></A>a petty farm at Rhodes, first showed the judges that his cause was just, 
<A NAME="561"></A>and then at the finish cried, "I will not entreat you: nor do I care what 
<A NAME="562"></A>sentence you pass. It is you who are on your trial, not I!"--And so he 
<A NAME="563"></A>ended the case.

<A NAME="564"></A><B>LV</B>

<A NAME="565"></A><BR><BR>As for us, we behave like a herd of deer. When they flee from the 
<A NAME="566"></A>huntsman's feathers in affright, which way do they turn? What haven of 
<A NAME="567"></A>safety do they make for? Why, they rush upon the nets! And thus they perish 
<A NAME="568"></A>by confounding what they should fear with that wherein no danger lies. 
<A NAME="569"></A>. . . Not death or pain is to be feared, but the fear of death or pain. 
<A NAME="570"></A>Well said the poet therefore:--
<A NAME="571"></A><BR><BR>Death has no terror; only a Death of shame!
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="572"></A><B>LVI</B>

<A NAME="573"></A><BR><BR>How is it then that certain external things are said to be natural, 
<A NAME="574"></A>and other contrary to Nature?
<A NAME="575"></A><BR><BR>Why, just as it might be said if we stood alone and apart from 
<A NAME="576"></A>others. A foot, for instance, I will allow it is natural should be clean. 
<A NAME="577"></A>But if you take it as a foot, and as a thing which does not stand by itself, 
<A NAME="578"></A>it will beseem it (if need be) to walk in the mud, to tread on thorns, 
<A NAME="579"></A>and sometimes even to be cut off, for the benefit of the whole body; else 
<A NAME="580"></A>it is no longer a foot. In some such way we should conceive of ourselves 
<A NAME="581"></A>also. What art thou?--A man.--Looked at as standing by thyself and separate, 
<A NAME="582"></A>it is natural for thee in health and wealth long to live. But looked at 
<A NAME="583"></A>as a Man, and only as a part of a Whole, it is for that Whole's sake that 
<A NAME="584"></A>thou shouldest at one time fall sick, at another brave the perils of the 
<A NAME="585"></A>sea, again, know the meaning of want and perhaps die an early death. Why 
<A NAME="586"></A>then repine? Knowest thou not that as the foot is no more a foot if detached 
<A NAME="587"></A>from the body, so thou in like case art no longer a Man? For what is a 
<A NAME="588"></A>Man? A part of a City:--first of the City of Gods and Men; next, of that 
<A NAME="589"></A>which ranks nearest it, a minature of the universal City. . . . In such 
<A NAME="590"></A>a body, in such a world enveloping us, among lives like these, such things 
<A NAME="591"></A>must happen to one or another. Thy part, then, being here, is to speak 
<A NAME="592"></A>of these things as is meet, and to order them as befits the 
<A NAME="593"></A>matter.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="594"></A><B>LVII</B>

<A NAME="595"></A><BR><BR>That was a good reply which Diogenes made to a man who asked him 
<A NAME="596"></A>for letters of recommendation.--"That you are a man, he will know when 
<A NAME="597"></A>he sees you;--whether a good or bad one, he will know if he has any skill 
<A NAME="598"></A>in discerning the good or bad. But if he has none, he will never know, 
<A NAME="599"></A>though I write him a thousand times."-- It is as though a piece of silver 
<A NAME="600"></A>money desired to be recommended to some one to be tested. If the man be 
<A NAME="601"></A>a good judge of silver, he will know: the coin will tell its own 
<A NAME="602"></A>tale.

<A NAME="604"></A><BR><BR>Even as the traveller asks his way of him that he meets, inclined 
<A NAME="605"></A>in no wise to bear to the right rather than to the left (for he desires 
<A NAME="606"></A>only the way leading whither he would go), so should we come unto God as 
<A NAME="607"></A>to a guide; even as we use our eyes without admonishing them to show us 
<A NAME="608"></A>some things rather than others, but content to receive the images of such 
<A NAME="609"></A>things as they present to us. But as it is we stand anxiously watching 
<A NAME="610"></A>the victim, and with the voice of supplication call upon the augur:-- "Master, 
<A NAME="611"></A>have mercy on me: vouchsafe unto me a way of escape!" Slave, would you 
<A NAME="612"></A>then have aught else then what is best? is there anything better than what 
<A NAME="613"></A>is God's good pleasure? Why, as far as in you lies, would you corrupt your 
<A NAME="614"></A>Judge, and lead your Counsellor astray?

<A NAME="616"></A><BR><BR>God is beneficent. But the Good also is beneficent. It should seem 
<A NAME="617"></A>then that where the real nature of God is, there too is to be found the 
<A NAME="618"></A>real nature of the Good. What then is the real nature of God?--Intelligence, 
<A NAME="619"></A>Knowledge, Right Reason. Here then without more ado seek the real nature 
<A NAME="620"></A>of the Good. For surely thou dost not seek it in a plant or in an animal 
<A NAME="621"></A>that reasoneth not.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="622"></A><B>LX</B>

<A NAME="623"></A><BR><BR>Seek then the real nature of the Good in that without whose presence 
<A NAME="624"></A>thou wilt not admit the Good to exist in aught else.-- What then? Are not 
<A NAME="625"></A>these other things also works of God?--They are; but not preferred to honour, 
<A NAME="626"></A>nor are they portions of God. But thou art a thing preferred to honour: 
<A NAME="627"></A>thou art thyself a fragment torn from God:--thou hast a portion of Him 
<A NAME="628"></A>within thyself. How is it then that thou dost not know thy high descent 
<A NAME="629"></A>--dost not know whence thou comest? When thou eatest, wilt thou not remember 
<A NAME="630"></A>who thou art that eatest and whom thou feedest? In intercourse, in exercise, 
<A NAME="631"></A>in discussion knowest thou not that it is a God whom thou feedest, a God 
<A NAME="632"></A>whom thou exercisest, a God whom thou bearest about with thee, O miserable! 
<A NAME="633"></A>and thou perceivest it not. Thinkest thou that I speak of a God of silver 
<A NAME="634"></A>or gold, that is without thee? Nay, thou bearest Him within thee! all unconcious 
<A NAME="635"></A>of polluting Him with thoughts impure and unclean deeds. Were an image 
<A NAME="636"></A>of God present, thou wouldest not dare to act as thou dost, yet, when God 
<A NAME="637"></A>Himself is present within thee, beholding and hearing all, thou dost not 
<A NAME="638"></A>blush to think such thoughts and do such deeds, O thou that art insensible 
<A NAME="639"></A>of thine own nature and liest under the wrath of God!
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="640"></A><B>LXI</B>

<A NAME="641"></A><BR><BR>Why then are we afraid when we send a young man from the Schools 
<A NAME="642"></A>into active life, lest he should indulge his appetites intemperately, lest 
<A NAME="643"></A>he should debase himself by ragged clothing, or be puffed up by fine raiment? 
<A NAME="644"></A>Knows he not the God within him; knows he not with whom he is starting 
<A NAME="645"></A>on his way? Have we patience to hear him say to us, Would I had thee with 
<A NAME="646"></A>me!--Hast thou not God where thou art, and having Him dost thou still seek 
<A NAME="647"></A>for any other! Would He tell thee aught else than these things? Why, wert 
<A NAME="648"></A>thou a statue of Phidias, an Athena or a Zeus, thou wouldst bethink thee 
<A NAME="649"></A>both of thyself and thine artificer; and hadst thou any sense, thou wouldst 
<A NAME="650"></A>strive to do no dishonour to thyself or him that fashioned thee, nor appear 
<A NAME="651"></A>to beholders in unbefitting guise. But now, because God is thy Maker, is 
<A NAME="652"></A>that why thou carest not of what sort thou shalt show thyself to be? Yet 
<A NAME="653"></A>how different the artists and their workmanship! What human artist's work, 
<A NAME="654"></A>for example, has in it the faculties that are displayed in fashioning it? 
<A NAME="655"></A>Is it aught but marble, bronze, gold, or ivory? Nay, when the Athena of 
<A NAME="656"></A>Phidias has put forth her hand and received therein a Victory, in that 
<A NAME="657"></A>attitude she stands for evermore. But God's works move and breathe; they 
<A NAME="658"></A>use and judge the things of sense. The workmanship of such an Artist, wilt 
<A NAME="659"></A>thou dishonor Him? Ay, when he not only fashioned thee, but placed thee, 
<A NAME="660"></A>like a ward, in the care and guardianship of thyself alone, wilt thou not 
<A NAME="661"></A>only forget this, but also do dishonour to what is committed to thy care! 
<A NAME="662"></A>If God had entrusted thee with an orphan, wouldst thou have thus neglected 
<A NAME="663"></A>him? He hath delivered thee to thine own care, saying, I had none more 
<A NAME="664"></A>faithful than myself: keep this man for me such as Nature hath made him--modest, 
<A NAME="665"></A>faithful, high-minded, a stranger to fear, to passion, to perturbation. 
<A NAME="666"></A>. . .
<A NAME="667"></A><BR><BR>Such will I show myself to you all.--"What, exempt from sickness 
<A NAME="668"></A>also: from age, from death?"--Nay, but accepting sickness, accepting death 
<A NAME="669"></A>as becomes a God!

<A NAME="675"></A><BR><BR>A guide, on finding a man who has lost his way, brings him back 
<A NAME="676"></A>to the right path--he does not mock and jeer at him and then take himself 
<A NAME="677"></A>off. You also must show the unlearned man the truth, and you will see that 
<A NAME="678"></A>he will follow. But so long as you do not show it him, you should not mock, 
<A NAME="679"></A>but rather feel your own incapacity.

<A NAME="680"></A><B>LXIV</B>

<A NAME="681"></A><BR><BR>It was the first and most striking characteristic of Socrates never 
<A NAME="682"></A>to become heated in discourse, never to utter an injurious or insulting 
<A NAME="683"></A>word--on the contrary, he persistently bore insult from others and thus 
<A NAME="684"></A>put an end to the fray. If you care to know the extent of his power in 
<A NAME="685"></A>this direction, read Xenophon's Banquet, and you will see how many quarrels 
<A NAME="686"></A>he put an end to. This is why the Poets are right in so highly commending 
<A NAME="687"></A>this faculty:--
<A NAME="688"></A><BR><BR>Quickly and wisely withal even bitter feuds would he 
<A NAME="689"></A>settle.
<A NAME="690"></A><BR><BR>Nevertheless the practice is not very safe at present, especially 
<A NAME="691"></A>in Rome. One who adopts it, I need not say, ought not to carry it out in 
<A NAME="692"></A>an obscure corner, but boldly accost, if occasion serve, some personage 
<A NAME="693"></A>of rank or wealth.
<A NAME="694"></A><BR><BR>"Can you tell me, sir, to whose care you entrust your 
<A NAME="695"></A>horses?"
<A NAME="696"></A><BR><BR>"I can."
<A NAME="697"></A><BR><BR>"Is it to the first corner, who knows nothing about 
<A NAME="698"></A>them?"
<A NAME="699"></A><BR><BR>"Certainly not."
<A NAME="700"></A><BR><BR>"Well, what of the man who takes care of your gold, your silver 
<A NAME="701"></A>or your raiment?"
<A NAME="702"></A><BR><BR>"He must be experienced also."
<A NAME="703"></A><BR><BR>"And your body--have you ever considered about entrusting it to 
<A NAME="704"></A>any one's care?"
<A NAME="705"></A><BR><BR>"Of course I have."
<A NAME="706"></A><BR><BR>"And no doubt to a person of experience as a trainer, a 
<A NAME="707"></A>physician?"
<A NAME="708"></A><BR><BR>"Surely."
<A NAME="709"></A><BR><BR>"And these things the best you possess, or have you anything more 
<A NAME="710"></A>precious?"
<A NAME="711"></A><BR><BR>"What can you mean?"
<A NAME="712"></A><BR><BR>"I mean that which employs these; which weights all things; which 
<A NAME="713"></A>takes counsel and resolve."
<A NAME="714"></A><BR><BR>"Oh, you mean the soul."
<A NAME="715"></A><BR><BR>"You take me rightly; I do mean the soul. By Heaven, I hold that 
<A NAME="716"></A>far more precious than all else I possess. Can you show me then what care 
<A NAME="717"></A>you bestow on a soul? For it can scarcely be thought that a man of your 
<A NAME="718"></A>wisdom and consideration in the city would suffer your most precious possession 
<A NAME="719"></A>to go to ruin through carelessness and neglect."
<A NAME="720"></A><BR><BR>"Certainly not."
<A NAME="721"></A><BR><BR>"Well, do you take care of it yourself? Did any one teach you the 
<A NAME="722"></A>right method, or did you discover it yourself?"
<A NAME="723"></A><BR><BR>Now here comes in the danger: first, that the great man may answer, 
<A NAME="724"></A>"Why, what is that to you, my good fellow? are you my master?" And then, 
<A NAME="725"></A>if you persist in troubling him, may raise his hand to strike you. It is 
<A NAME="726"></A>a practice of which I was myself a warm admirer until such experiences 
<A NAME="727"></A>as these befell me.

<A NAME="729"></A><BR><BR>When a youth was giving himself airs in the Theatre and saying,

<A NAME="734"></A><BR><BR>We see that a carpenter becomes a carpenter by learning certain 
<A NAME="735"></A>things: that a pilot, by learning certain things, becomes a pilot. Possibly 
<A NAME="736"></A>also in the present case the mere desire to be wise and good is not enough. 
<A NAME="737"></A>It is necessary to learn certain things. This is then the object of our 
<A NAME="738"></A>search. The Philosophers would have us first learn that there is a God, 
<A NAME="739"></A>and that His Providence directs the Universe; further, that to hide from 
<A NAME="740"></A>Him not only one's acts but even one's thoughts and intentions is impossible; 
<A NAME="741"></A>secondly, what the nature of God is. Whatever that nature is discovered 
<A NAME="742"></A>to be, the man who would please and obey Him must strive with all his might 
<A NAME="743"></A>to be made like unto him. If the Divine is faithful, he also must be faithful; 
<A NAME="744"></A>if free, he also must be free; if beneficent, he also must be beneficent; 
<A NAME="745"></A>if magnanimous, he also must be magnanimous. Thus as an imitator of God 
<A NAME="746"></A>must he follow Him in every deed and word.

<A NAME="748"></A><BR><BR>If I show you, that you lack just what is most important and necessary 
<A NAME="749"></A>to happiness, that hitherto your attention has been bestowed on everything 
<A NAME="750"></A>rather than that which claims it most; and, to crown all, that you know 
<A NAME="751"></A>neither what God nor Man is-- neither what Good or Evil is: why, that you 
<A NAME="752"></A>are ignorant of everything else, perhaps you may bear to be told; but to 
<A NAME="753"></A>hear that you know nothing of yourself, how could you submit to that? How 
<A NAME="754"></A>could you stand your ground and suffer that to be proved? Clearly not at 
<A NAME="755"></A>all. You instantly turn away in wrath. Yet what harm have I done to you? 
<A NAME="756"></A>Unless indeed the mirror harms the ill-favoured man by showing him to himself 
<A NAME="757"></A>just as he is; unless the physician can be thought to insult his patient, 
<A NAME="758"></A>when he tells him:--"Friend, do you suppose there is nothing wrong with 
<A NAME="759"></A>you? why, you have a fever. Eat nothing to-day, and drink only water." 
<A NAME="760"></A>Yet no one says, "What an insufferable insult!" Whereas if you say to a 
<A NAME="761"></A>man, "Your desires are inflamed, your instincts of rejection are weak and 
<A NAME="762"></A>low, your aims are inconsistent, your impulses are not in harmony with 
<A NAME="763"></A>Nature, your opinions are rash and false," he forthwith goes away and complains 
<A NAME="764"></A>that you have insulted him.

<A NAME="766"></A><BR><BR>Our way of life resembles a fair. The flocks and herds are passing 
<A NAME="767"></A>along to be sold, and the greater part of the crowd to buy and sell. But 
<A NAME="768"></A>there are some few who come only to look at the fair, to inquire how and 
<A NAME="769"></A>why it is being held, upon what authority and with what object. So too, 
<A NAME="770"></A>in this great Fair of life, some, like the cattle, trouble themselves about 
<A NAME="771"></A>nothing but the fodder. Know all of you, who are busied about land, slaves 
<A NAME="772"></A>and public posts, that these are nothing but fodder! Some few there are 
<A NAME="773"></A>attending the Fair, who love to contemplate what the world is, what He 
<A NAME="774"></A>that administers it. Can there be no Administrator? is it possible, that 
<A NAME="775"></A>while neither city nor household could endure even a moment without one 
<A NAME="776"></A>to administer and see to its welfare, this Fabric, so fair, so vast, should 
<A NAME="777"></A>be administered in order so harmonious, without a purpose and by blind 
<A NAME="778"></A>chance? There is therefore an Administrator. What is His nature and how 
<A NAME="779"></A>does He administer? And who are we that are His children and what work 
<A NAME="780"></A>were we born to perform? Have we any close connection or relation with 
<A NAME="781"></A>Him or not?
<A NAME="782"></A><BR><BR>Such are the impressions of the few of whom I speak. And further, 
<A NAME="783"></A>they apply themselves solely to considering and examining the great assembly 
<A NAME="784"></A>before they depart. Well, they are derided by the multitude. So are the 
<A NAME="785"></A>lookers-on by the traders: aye, and if the beasts had any sense, they would 
<A NAME="786"></A>deride those who thought much of anything but fodder!

<A NAME="818"></A>he was believed to be God's son, as indeed he was. So then in obedience

<A NAME="828"></A>be forced to follow a Might greater than thine own, ever seeking Tranquillity 
<A NAME="829"></A>without, and never able to attain unto her. For thou seekest her where 
<A NAME="830"></A>she is not to be found; and where she is, there thou seekest her 
<A NAME="831"></A>not!
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="832"></A><B>LXXII</B>

<A NAME="833"></A><BR><BR>If a man would pursue Philosophy, his first task is to throw away 
<A NAME="834"></A>conceit. For it is impossible for a man to begin to learn what he has a 
<A NAME="835"></A>conceit that he already knows.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="836"></A><B>LXXIII</B>

<A NAME="837"></A><BR><BR>Give me but one young man, that has come to the School with this 
<A NAME="838"></A>intention, who stands forth a champion of this cause, and says, "All else 
<A NAME="839"></A>I renounce, content if I am but able to pass my life free from hindrance 
<A NAME="840"></A>and trouble; to raise my head aloft and face all things as a free man; 
<A NAME="841"></A>to look up to heaven as a friend of God, fearing nothing that may come 
<A NAME="842"></A>to pass!" Point out such a one to me, that I may say, "Enter, young man, 
<A NAME="843"></A>into possession of that which is thine own. For thy lot is to adorn Philosophy. 
<A NAME="844"></A>Thine are these possessions; thine these books, these 
<A NAME="845"></A>discourses!"
<A NAME="846"></A><BR><BR>And when our champion has duly exercised himself in this part of 
<A NAME="847"></A>the subject, I hope he will come back to me and say:-- "What I desire is 
<A NAME="848"></A>to be free from passion and from perturbation; as one who grudges no pains 
<A NAME="849"></A>in the pursuit of piety and philosophy, what I desire is to know my duty 
<A NAME="850"></A>to the Gods, my duty to my parents, to my brothers, to my country, to 
<A NAME="851"></A>strangers."
<A NAME="852"></A><BR><BR>"Enter then on the second part of the subject; it is thine 
<A NAME="853"></A>also."
<A NAME="854"></A><BR><BR>"But I have already mastered the second part; only I wished to 
<A NAME="855"></A>stand firm and unshaken--as firm when asleep as when awake, as firm when 
<A NAME="856"></A>elated with wine as in despondency and dejection."
<A NAME="857"></A><BR><BR>"Friend, you are verily a God! you cherish great 
<A NAME="858"></A>designs."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="859"></A><B>LXXIV</B>

<A NAME="860"></A><BR><BR>"The question at stake," said Epictetus, "is no common one; it 
<A NAME="861"></A>is this:--Are we in our senses, or are we not?"
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="862"></A><B>LXXV</B>

<A NAME="863"></A><BR><BR>If you have given way to anger, be sure that over and above the 
<A NAME="864"></A>evil involved therein, you have strengthened the habit, and added fuel 
<A NAME="865"></A>to the fire. If overcome by a temptation of the flesh, do not reckon it 
<A NAME="866"></A>a single defeat, but that you have also strengthened your dissolute habits. 
<A NAME="867"></A>Habits and faculties are necessarily affected by the corresponding acts. 
<A NAME="868"></A>Those that were not there before, spring up: the rest gain in strength 
<A NAME="869"></A>and extent. This is the account which Philosophers give of the origin of 
<A NAME="870"></A>diseases of the mind:--Suppose you have once lusted after money: if reason 
<A NAME="871"></A>sufficient to produce a sense of evil be applied, then the lust is checked, 
<A NAME="872"></A>and the mind at once regains its original authority; whereas if you have 
<A NAME="873"></A>recourse to no remedy, you can no longer look for this return--on the contrary, 
<A NAME="874"></A>the next time it is excited by the corresponding object, the flame of desire 
<A NAME="875"></A>leaps up more quickly than before. By frequent repetition, the mind in 
<A NAME="876"></A>the long run becomes callous; and thus this mental disease produces confirmed 
<A NAME="877"></A>Avarice.
<A NAME="878"></A><BR><BR>One who has had fever, even when it has left him, is not in the 
<A NAME="879"></A>same condition of health as before, unless indeed his cure is complete. 
<A NAME="880"></A>Something of the same sort is true also of diseases of the mind. Behind, 
<A NAME="881"></A>there remains a legacy of traces and blisters: and unless these are effectually 
<A NAME="882"></A>erased, subsequent blows on the same spot will produce no longer mere blisters, 
<A NAME="883"></A>but sores. If you do not wish to be prone to anger, do not feed the habit; 
<A NAME="884"></A>give it nothing which may tend its increase. At first, keep quiet and count 
<A NAME="885"></A>the days when you were not angry: "I used to be angry every day, then every 
<A NAME="886"></A>other day: next every two, next every three days!" and if you succeed in 
<A NAME="887"></A>passing thirty days, sacrifice to the Gods in thanksgiving.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="888"></A><B>LXXVI</B>

<A NAME="889"></A><BR><BR>How then may this be attained?--Resolve, now if never before, to 
<A NAME="890"></A>approve thyself to thyself; resolve to show thyself fair in God's sight; 
<A NAME="891"></A>long to be pure with thine own pure self and God!
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="892"></A><B>LXXVII</B>

<A NAME="893"></A><BR><BR>That is the true athlete, that trains himself to resist such outward 
<A NAME="894"></A>impressions as these.
<A NAME="895"></A><BR><BR>"Stay, wretched man! suffer not thyself to be carried away!" Great 
<A NAME="896"></A>is the combat, divine the task! you are fighting for Kingship, for Liberty, 
<A NAME="897"></A>for Happiness, for Tranquillity. Remember God: call upon Him to aid thee, 
<A NAME="898"></A>like a comrade that stands beside thee in the fight.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="899"></A><B>LXXVIII</B>

<A NAME="900"></A><BR><BR>Who then is a Stoic--in the sense that we call a statue of Phidias 
<A NAME="901"></A>which is modelled after that master's art? Show me a man in this sense 
<A NAME="902"></A>modelled after the doctrines that are ever upon his lips. Show me a man 
<A NAME="903"></A>that is sick--and happy; an exile--and happy; in evil report--and happy! 
<A NAME="904"></A>Show me him, I ask again. So help me Heaven, I long to see one Stoic! Nay, 
<A NAME="905"></A>if you cannot show me one fully modelled, let me at least see one in whom 
<A NAME="906"></A>the process is at work--one whose bent is in that direction. Do me that 
<A NAME="907"></A>favour! Grudge it not to an old man, to behold a sight he has never yet 
<A NAME="908"></A>beheld. Think you I wish to see the Zeus or Athena of Phidias, bedecked 
<A NAME="909"></A>with gold and ivory?--Nay, show me, one of you, a human soul, desiring 
<A NAME="910"></A>to be of one mind with God, no more to lay blame on God or man, to suffer 
<A NAME="911"></A>nothing to disappoint, nothing to cross him, to yield neither to anger, 
<A NAME="912"></A>envy, nor jealousy--in a word, why disguise the matter? one that from a 
<A NAME="913"></A>man would fan become a God; one that while still imprisioned in this dead 
<A NAME="914"></A>body makes fellowship with God his aim. Show me him!--Ah, you cannot! Then 
<A NAME="915"></A>why mock yourselves and delude others? why stalk about tricked out in other 
<A NAME="916"></A>men's attrire, thieves and robbers that you are of names and things to 
<A NAME="917"></A>which you can show no title!
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="918"></A><B>LXXIX</B>

<A NAME="919"></A><BR><BR>If you have assumed a character beyond your strength, you have 
<A NAME="920"></A>both played a poor figure in that, and neglected one that is within your 
<A NAME="921"></A>powers.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="922"></A><B>LXXX</B>

<A NAME="923"></A><BR><BR>Fellow, you have come to blows at home with a slave: you have turned 
<A NAME="924"></A>the household upside down, and thrown the neighbourhood into confusion; 
<A NAME="925"></A>and do you come to me then with airs of assumed modesty--do you sit down 
<A NAME="926"></A>like a sage and criticise my explanantion of the readings, and whatever 
<A NAME="927"></A>idle babble you say has come into my head? Have you come full of envy, 
<A NAME="928"></A>and dejected because nothing is sent you from home; and while the discussion 
<A NAME="929"></A>is going on, do you sit brooding on nothing but how your father or your 
<A NAME="930"></A>brother are disposed towards you:--"What are they saying about me there? 
<A NAME="931"></A>at this moment they imagine I am making progress and saying, He will return 
<A NAME="932"></A>perfectly omniscient! I wish I could become omniscient before I return; 
<A NAME="933"></A>but that would be very troublesome. No one sends me anything--the baths 
<A NAME="934"></A>at Nicopolis are dirty; things are wretched at home and wretched here." 
<A NAME="935"></A>And then they say, "Nobody is any the better for the School."--Who comes 
<A NAME="936"></A>to the School with a sincere wish to learn: to submit his principles to 
<A NAME="937"></A>correction and himself to treatment? Who, to gain a sense of his wants? 
<A NAME="938"></A>Why then be surprised if you carry home from the School exactly what you 
<A NAME="939"></A>bring into it?
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="940"></A><B>LXXXI</B>

<A NAME="941"></A><BR><BR>"Epictetus, I have often come desiring to hear you speak, and you 
<A NAME="942"></A>have never given me any answer; now if possible, I entreat you, say something 
<A NAME="943"></A>to me."
<A NAME="944"></A><BR><BR>"Is there, do you think," replied Epictetus, "an art of speaking 
<A NAME="945"></A>as of other things, if it is to be done skilfully and with profit to the 
<A NAME="946"></A>hearer?"
<A NAME="947"></A><BR><BR>"Yes."
<A NAME="948"></A><BR><BR>"And are all profited by what they hear, or only some among them? 
<A NAME="949"></A>So that it seems there is an art of hearing as well as of speaking. . . 
<A NAME="950"></A>. To make a statue needs skill: to view a statue aright needs skill 
<A NAME="951"></A>also."
<A NAME="952"></A><BR><BR>"Admitted."
<A NAME="953"></A><BR><BR>"And I think all will allow that one who proposes to hear philosophers 
<A NAME="954"></A>speak needs a considerable training in hearing. Is that not so? The tell 
<A NAME="955"></A>me on what subject your are able to hear me."
<A NAME="956"></A><BR><BR>"Why, on good and evil."
<A NAME="957"></A><BR><BR>"The good and evil of what? a horse, an ox?"
<A NAME="958"></A><BR><BR>"No; of a man."
<A NAME="959"></A><BR><BR>"Do we know then what Man is? what his nature is? what is th idea 
<A NAME="960"></A>we have of him? And are our ears practised in any degree on the subject? 
<A NAME="961"></A>Nay, do you understand what Nature is? can you follow me in any degree 
<A NAME="962"></A>when I say that I shall have to use demonstration? Do you understand what 
<A NAME="963"></A>Demonstration is? what True or False is? . . .must I drive you to Philosophy? 
<A NAME="964"></A>. . .Show me what good I am to do by discoursing with you. Rouse my desire 
<A NAME="965"></A>to do so. The sight of a pasture it loves stirs in a sheep the desire to 
<A NAME="966"></A>feed: show it a stone or a bit of bread and it remains unmoved. Thus we 
<A NAME="967"></A>also have certain natural desires, aye, and one that moves us to speak 
<A NAME="968"></A>when we find a listener that is worth his salt: one that hhimself stirs 
<A NAME="969"></A>the spirit. But if he sits by like a stone or a tuft of grass, how can 
<A NAME="970"></A>he rouse a man's desire?"
<A NAME="971"></A><BR><BR>"Then you will say nothing to me?"
<A NAME="972"></A><BR><BR>"I can only tell you this: that one who knows not who he is and 
<A NAME="973"></A>to what end he was born; what kind of world this is and with whom he is 
<A NAME="974"></A>associated therein; one who cannot distinguish Good and Evil, Beauty and 
<A NAME="975"></A>Foulness, . . . Truth and Falsehood, will never follow Reason in shaping 
<A NAME="976"></A>his desires and impulses and repulsions, nor yet in assent, denial, or 
<A NAME="977"></A>suspension of judgement; but will in one word go about deaf and blind, 
<A NAME="978"></A>thinking himself to be somewhat, when he is in truth of no account. Is 
<A NAME="979"></A>there anything new in  all this? Is not this ignorance the cause of all 
<A NAME="980"></A>the mistakes and mischances of men since the human race began? . . 
<A NAME="981"></A>."
<A NAME="982"></A><BR><BR>"This is all I have to say to you, and even this against the grain. 
<A NAME="983"></A>Why? Because you have not stirred my spirit. For what can I see in you 
<A NAME="984"></A>to stir me, as a spirited horse will stir a judge of horses? Your body? 
<A NAME="985"></A>That you maltreat. Your dress? That is luxurious. You behavior, your look?--Nothing 
<A NAME="986"></A>whatever. When you want to hear a philosopher, do not say,  You say nothing 
<A NAME="987"></A>to me'; only show yourself worthy or fit to hear, and then you will see 
<A NAME="988"></A>how you will move the speaker."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="989"></A><B>LXXXII</B>

<A NAME="990"></A><BR><BR>And now, when you see brothers apparently good friends and living 
<A NAME="991"></A>in accord, do not immediately pronounce anything upon their friendship, 
<A NAME="992"></A>though they should affirm it with an oath, though they should declare, 
<A NAME="993"></A>"For us to live apart in a thing impossible!" For the heart of a bad man 
<A NAME="994"></A>is faithless, unprincipled, inconstant: now overpowered by one impression, 
<A NAME="995"></A>now by another. Ask not the usual questions, Were they born of the same 
<A NAME="996"></A>parents, reared together, and under the same tutor; but ask this only, 
<A NAME="997"></A>in what they place their real interest--whether in outward things or in 
<A NAME="998"></A>the Will. If in outward things, call them not friends, any more than faithful, 
<A NAME="999"></A>constant, brave or free: call them not even human beings, if you have any 
<A NAME="1000"></A>sense. . . . But should you hear that these men hold the Good to lie only 
<A NAME="1001"></A>in the Will, only in rightly dealing with the things of sense, take no 
<A NAME="1002"></A>more trouble to inquire whether they are father and son or brothers, or 
<A NAME="1003"></A>comrades of long standing; but, sure of this one thing, pronounce as boldly 
<A NAME="1004"></A>that they are friends as that they are faithful and just: for where else 
<A NAME="1005"></A>can Friendship be found than where Modesty is, where there is an interchange 
<A NAME="1006"></A>of things fair and honest, and of such only?
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1007"></A><B>LXXXIII</B>

<A NAME="1008"></A><BR><BR>No man can rob us of our Will--no man can lord it over 
<A NAME="1009"></A>that!
