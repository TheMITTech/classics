<A NAME="10"></A><B>Chapter 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Of finery in dress
<A NAME="12"></A><BR><BR>A certain young man a rhetorician came to see Epictetus, with his 
<A NAME="13"></A>hair dressed more carefully than was usual and his attire in an ornamental 
<A NAME="14"></A>style; whereupon Epictetus said: Tell me you do not think that some dogs 
<A NAME="15"></A>are beautiful and some horses, and so of all other animals. "I do think 
<A NAME="16"></A>so," the youth replied. Are not then some men also beautiful and others 
<A NAME="17"></A>ugly? "Certainly." Do we, then, for the same reason call each of them in 
<A NAME="18"></A>the same kind beautiful, or each beautiful for something peculiar? And 
<A NAME="19"></A>you will judge of this matter thus. Since we see a dog naturally formed 
<A NAME="20"></A>for one thing, and a horse for another, and for another still, as an example, 
<A NAME="21"></A>a nightingale, we may generally and not improperly declare each of them 
<A NAME="22"></A>to be beautiful then when it is most excellent according to its nature; 
<A NAME="23"></A>but since the nature of each is different, each of them seems to me to 
<A NAME="24"></A>be beautiful in a different way. Is it not so? He admitted that it was. 
<A NAME="25"></A>That then which makes a dog beautiful, makes a horse ugly; and that which 
<A NAME="26"></A>makes a horse beautiful, makes a dog ugly, if it is true that their natures 
<A NAME="27"></A>are different. "It seems to be so." For I think that what makes a pancratiast 
<A NAME="28"></A>beautiful, makes a wrestler to be not good, and a runner to be most ridiculous; 
<A NAME="29"></A>and he who is beautiful for the Pentathlon, is very ugly for wrestling. 
<A NAME="30"></A>"It is so," said he. What, then, makes a man beautiful? Is that which in 
<A NAME="31"></A>its kind makes both a dog and a horse beautiful? "It is," he said. What 
<A NAME="32"></A>then makes a dog beautiful? The possession of the excellence of a dog. 
<A NAME="33"></A>And what makes a horse beautiful? The possession of the excellence of a 
<A NAME="34"></A>horse. What then makes a man beautiful? Is it not the possession of the 
<A NAME="35"></A>excellence of a man? And do you, then, if you wish to be beautiful, young 
<A NAME="36"></A>man, labour at this, the acquisition of human excellence. But what is this? 
<A NAME="37"></A>Observe whom you yourself praise, when you praise many persons without 
<A NAME="38"></A>partiality: do you praise the just or the unjust? "The just." Whether do 
<A NAME="39"></A>you praise the moderate or the immoderate? "The moderate." And the temperate 
<A NAME="40"></A>or the intemperate? "The temperate." If, then, you make yourself such a 
<A NAME="41"></A>person, you will know that you will make yourself beautiful: but so long 
<A NAME="42"></A>as you neglect these things, you must be ugly, even though you contrive 
<A NAME="43"></A>all you can to appear beautiful.
<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR>Further I do not know what to say to you: for if I say to you what 
<A NAME="45"></A>I think, I shall offend you, and you will perhaps leave the school and 
<A NAME="46"></A>not return to it: and if I do not say what I think, see how I shall be 
<A NAME="47"></A>acting, if you come to me to be improved, and I shall not improve you at 
<A NAME="48"></A>all, and if you come to me as to a philosopher, and I shall say nothing 
<A NAME="49"></A>to you as a philosopher. And how cruel it is to you to leave you uncorrected. 
<A NAME="50"></A>If at any time afterward you shall acquire sense, you will with good reason 
<A NAME="51"></A>blame me and say, "What did Epictetus observe in me that, when he saw me 
<A NAME="52"></A>in such a plight coming to him in such a scandalous condition, he neglected 
<A NAME="53"></A>me and never said a word? did he so much despair of me? was I not young? 
<A NAME="54"></A>was I not able to listen to reason? and how many other young men at this 
<A NAME="55"></A>age commit many like errors? I hear that a certain Polemon from being a 
<A NAME="56"></A>most dissolute youth underwent such a great change. Well, suppose that 
<A NAME="57"></A>he did not think that I should be a Polemon; yet he might have set my hair 
<A NAME="58"></A>right, he might have stripped off my decorations, he might have stopped 
<A NAME="59"></A>me from plucking the hair out of my body; but when he saw me dressed like- 
<A NAME="60"></A>what shall I say?- he kept silent." I do not say like what; but you will 
<A NAME="61"></A>say, when you come to your senses and shall know what it is and what persons 
<A NAME="62"></A>use such a dress.
<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR>If you bring this charge against me hereafter, what defense shall 
<A NAME="64"></A>I make? Why, shall I say that the man will not be persuaded by me? Was 
<A NAME="65"></A>Laius persuaded by Apollo? Did he and get drunk and show no care for the 
<A NAME="66"></A>oracle? Well then, for this reason did Apollo refuse to tell him the truth? 
<A NAME="67"></A>I indeed do not know, whether you will be persuaded by me or not; but Apollo 
<A NAME="68"></A>knew most certainly that Laius would not be persuaded and yet he spoke. 
<A NAME="69"></A>But why did he speak? I say in reply: But why is he Apollo, and why does 
<A NAME="70"></A>he deliver oracles, and why has he fixed himself in this place as a prophet 
<A NAME="71"></A>and source of truth and for the inhabitants of the world to resort to him? 
<A NAME="72"></A>and why are the words "Know yourself" written in front of the temple, though 
<A NAME="73"></A>no person takes any notice of them?
<A NAME="74"></A><BR><BR>Did Socrates persuade all his hearers to take care of themselves? 
<A NAME="75"></A>Not the thousandth part. But, however, after he had been placed in this 
<A NAME="76"></A>position by the deity, as he himself says, he never left it. But what does 
<A NAME="77"></A>he say even to his judges? "If you acquit me on these conditions that I 
<A NAME="78"></A>no longer do that which I do now, I will not consent and I will not desist; 
<A NAME="79"></A>but I will go up both to young and to old, and, to speak plainly, to every 
<A NAME="80"></A>man whom I meet, and I will ask the questions which I ask now; and most 
<A NAME="81"></A>particularly will I do this to you my fellow-citizens, because you are 
<A NAME="82"></A>more nearly related to me." Are you so curious, Socrates, and such a busybody? 
<A NAME="83"></A>and how does it concern you how we act? and what is it that you say? "Being 
<A NAME="84"></A>of the same community and of the same kin, you neglect yourself, and show 
<A NAME="85"></A>yourself a bad citizen to the state, and a bad kinsman to your kinsmen, 
<A NAME="86"></A>and a bad neighbor to your neighbors." "Who, then are you?" Here it is 
<A NAME="87"></A>a great thing to say, "I am he whose duty it is to take care of men; for 
<A NAME="88"></A>it is not every little heifer which dares to resist a lion; but if the 
<A NAME="89"></A>bull comes up and resists him, say to the bull, if you choose, 'And who 
<A NAME="90"></A>are you, and what business have you here?'" Man, in every kind there is 
<A NAME="91"></A>produced something which excels; in oxen, in dogs, in bees, in horses. 
<A NAME="92"></A>Do not then say to that which excels, "Who, then, are you?" If you do, 
<A NAME="93"></A>it will find a voice in some way and say, "I am such a thing as the purple 
<A NAME="94"></A>in a garment: do not expect me to be like the others, or blame my nature 
<A NAME="95"></A>that it has made me different from the rest of men."
<A NAME="96"></A><BR><BR>What then? am I such a man? Certainly not. And are you such a man 
<A NAME="97"></A>as can listen to the truth? I wish you were. But however since in a manner 
<A NAME="98"></A>I have been condemned to wear a white beard and a cloak, and you come to 
<A NAME="99"></A>me as to a philosopher, I will not treat you in a cruel way nor yet as 
<A NAME="100"></A>if I despaired of you, but I will say: Young man, whom do you wish to make 
<A NAME="101"></A>beautiful? In the first place, know who you are and then adorn yourself 
<A NAME="102"></A>appropriately. You are a human being; and this is a mortal animal which 
<A NAME="103"></A>has the power of using appearances rationally. But what is meant by "rationally?" 
<A NAME="104"></A>Conformably to nature and completely. What, then, do you possess which 
<A NAME="105"></A>is peculiar? Is it the animal part? No. Is it the condition of mortality? 
<A NAME="106"></A>No. Is it the power of using appearances? No. You possess the rational 
<A NAME="107"></A>faculty as a peculiar thing: adorn and beautify this; but leave your hair 
<A NAME="108"></A>to him who made it as he chose. Come, what other appellations have you? 
<A NAME="109"></A>Are you man or woman? "Man." Adorn yourself then as man, not as woman. 
<A NAME="110"></A>Woman is naturally smooth and delicate; and if she has much hair (on her 
<A NAME="111"></A>body), she is a monster and is exhibited at Rome among monsters. And in 
<A NAME="112"></A>a man it is monstrous not to have hair; and if he has no hair, he is a 
<A NAME="113"></A>monster; but if he cuts off his hairs and plucks them out, what shall we 
<A NAME="114"></A>do with him? where shall we exhibit him? and under what name shall we show 
<A NAME="115"></A>him? "I will exhibit to you a man who chooses to be a woman rather than 
<A NAME="116"></A>a man." What a terrible sight! There is no man who will not wonder at such 
<A NAME="117"></A>a notice. Indeed I think that the men who pluck out their hairs do what 
<A NAME="118"></A>they do without knowing what they do. Man what fault have you to find with 
<A NAME="119"></A>your nature? That it made you a man? What then? was it fit that nature 
<A NAME="120"></A>should make all human creatures women? and what advantage in that case 
<A NAME="121"></A>would you have had in being adorned? for whom would you have adorned yourself, 
<A NAME="122"></A>if all human creatures were women? But you are not pleased with the matter: 
<A NAME="123"></A>set to work then upon the whole business. Take away- what is its name?- 
<A NAME="124"></A>that which is the cause of the hairs: make yourself a woman in all respects, 
<A NAME="125"></A>that we may not be mistaken: do not make one half man, and the other half 
<A NAME="126"></A>woman. Whom do you wish to please? The women?, Please them as a man. "Well; 
<A NAME="127"></A>but they like smooth men." Will you not hang yourself? and if women took 
<A NAME="128"></A>delight in catamites, would you become one? Is this your business? were 
<A NAME="129"></A>you born for this purpose, that dissolute women should delight in you? 
<A NAME="130"></A>Shall we make such a one as you a citizen of Corinth and perchance a prefect 
<A NAME="131"></A>of the city, or chief of the youth, or general or superintendent of the 
<A NAME="132"></A>games? Well, and when you have taken a wife, do you intend to have your 
<A NAME="133"></A>hairs plucked out? To please whom and for what purpose? And when you have 
<A NAME="134"></A>begotten children, will you introduce them also into the state with the 
<A NAME="135"></A>habit of plucking their hairs? A beautiful citizen, and senator and rhetorician. 
<A NAME="136"></A>We ought to pray that such young men be born among us and brought 
<A NAME="137"></A>up.
<A NAME="138"></A><BR><BR>Do not so, I entreat you by the Gods, young man: but when you have 
<A NAME="139"></A>once heard these words, go away and say to yourself, "Epictetus has not 
<A NAME="140"></A>said this to me; for how could he? but some propitious good through him: 
<A NAME="141"></A>for it would never have come into his thoughts to say this, since he is 
<A NAME="142"></A>not accustomed to talk thus with any person. Come then let us obey God, 
<A NAME="143"></A>that we may not be subject to his anger." You say, "No." But, if a crow 
<A NAME="144"></A>by his croaking signifies anything to you, it is not the crow which signifies, 
<A NAME="145"></A>but God through the crow; and if he signifies anything through a human 
<A NAME="146"></A>voice, will he not cause the man to say this to you, that you may know 
<A NAME="147"></A>the power of the divinity, that he signifies to some in this way, and to 
<A NAME="148"></A>others in that way, and concerning the greatest things and the chief he 
<A NAME="149"></A>signifies through the noblest messenger? What else is it which the poet 
<A NAME="150"></A>says:
<A NAME="151"></A><BR><BR>For we ourselves have warned him, and have sent
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>Hermes the careful watcher, Argus' slayer,
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>The husband not to kill nor wed the wife. Was Hermes going to descend 
<A NAME="154"></A>from heaven to say this to him? And now the Gods say this to you and send 
<A NAME="155"></A>the messenger, the slayer of Argus, to warn you not to pervert that which 
<A NAME="156"></A>is well arranged, nor to busy yourself about it, but to allow a man to 
<A NAME="157"></A>be a man, and a woman to be a woman, a beautiful man to be as a beautiful 
<A NAME="158"></A>man, and an ugly man as an ugly man, for you are not flesh and hair, but 
<A NAME="159"></A>you are will; and if your will beautiful, then you will be beautiful. But 
<A NAME="160"></A>up the present time I dare not tell you that you are ugly, for I think 
<A NAME="161"></A>that you are readier to hear anything than this. But see what Socrates 
<A NAME="162"></A>says to the most beautiful and blooming of men Alcibiades: "Try, then, 
<A NAME="163"></A>to be beautiful." What does he say to him? "Dress your hair and pluck the 
<A NAME="164"></A>hairs from your legs." Nothing of that kind. But "Adorn your will, take 
<A NAME="165"></A>away bad opinions." "How with the body?" Leave it as it is by nature. Another 
<A NAME="166"></A>has looked after these things: intrust them to him. "What then, must a 
<A NAME="167"></A>man be uncleaned?" Certainly not; but what you are and are made by nature, 
<A NAME="168"></A>cleanse this. A man should be cleanly as a man, a woman as a woman, a child 
<A NAME="169"></A>as a child. You say no: but let us also pluck out the lion's mane, that 
<A NAME="170"></A>he may not be uncleaned, and the cock's comb for he also ought to he cleaned. 
<A NAME="171"></A>Granted, but as a cock, and the lion as a lion, and the hunting dog as 
<A NAME="172"></A>a hunting dog.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="173"></A><B>Chapter 2</B>

<A NAME="174"></A><BR><BR>In what a man ought to be exercised who has made proficiency; and 
<A NAME="175"></A>that we neglect the chief things
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR>There are three things in which a man ought to exercise himself 
<A NAME="177"></A>who would be wise and good. The first concerns the desires and the aversions, 
<A NAME="178"></A>that a man may not fail to get what he desires, and that he may not fall 
<A NAME="179"></A>into that which he does not desire. The second concerns the movements (toward) 
<A NAME="180"></A>and the movements from an object, and generally in doing what a man ought 
<A NAME="181"></A>to do, that he may act according to order, to reason, and not carelessly. 
<A NAME="182"></A>The third thing concerns freedom from deception and rashness in judgement, 
<A NAME="183"></A>and generally it concerns the assents. Of these topics the chief and the 
<A NAME="184"></A>most urgent is that which relates to the affects; for an affect is produced 
<A NAME="185"></A>in no other way than by a failing to obtain that which a man desires or 
<A NAME="186"></A>a falling into that which a man would wish to avoid. This is that which 
<A NAME="187"></A>brings in perturbations, disorders, bad fortune, misfortunes, sorrows, 
<A NAME="188"></A>lamentations and envy; that which makes men envious and jealous; and by 
<A NAME="189"></A>these causes we are unable even to listen to the precepts of reason. The 
<A NAME="190"></A>second topic concerns the duties of a man; for I ought not to be free from 
<A NAME="191"></A>affects like a statue, but I ought to maintain the relations natural and 
<A NAME="192"></A>acquired, as a pious man, as a son, as a father, as a 
<A NAME="193"></A>citizen.
<A NAME="194"></A><BR><BR>The third topic is that which immediately concerns those who are 
<A NAME="195"></A>making proficiency, that which concerns the security of the other two, 
<A NAME="196"></A>so that not even in sleep any appearance unexamined may surprise us, nor 
<A NAME="197"></A>in intoxication, nor in melancholy. "This," it may be said, "is above our 
<A NAME="198"></A>power." But the present philosophers neglecting the first topic and the 
<A NAME="199"></A>second, employ themselves on the third, using sophistical arguments, making 
<A NAME="200"></A>conclusions from questioning, employing hypotheses, lying. "For a man must," 
<A NAME="201"></A>as it is said, "when employed on these matters, take care that he is not 
<A NAME="202"></A>deceived." Who must? The wise and good man. This then is all that is wanting 
<A NAME="203"></A>to you. Have you successfully worked out the rest? Are you free from deception 
<A NAME="204"></A>in the matter of money? If you see a beautiful girl, do you resist the 
<A NAME="205"></A>appearance? If your neighbor obtains an estate by will, are you not vexed? 
<A NAME="206"></A>Now is there nothing else wanting to you except unchangeable firmness of 
<A NAME="207"></A>mind? Wretch, you hear these very things with fear and anxiety that some 
<A NAME="208"></A>person may despise you, and with inquiries about what any person may say 
<A NAME="209"></A>about you. And if a man come and tell you that in a certain conversation 
<A NAME="210"></A>in which the question was, "Who is the best philosopher," a man who was 
<A NAME="211"></A>present said that a certain person was the chief philosopher, your little 
<A NAME="212"></A>soul which was only a finger's length stretches out to two cubits. But 
<A NAME="213"></A>if another who is present "You are mistaken; it is not worth while to listen 
<A NAME="214"></A>to a certain person, for what does he know? he has only the first principles, 
<A NAME="215"></A>and no more?" then you are confounded, you grow pale, you cry out immediately, 
<A NAME="216"></A>"I will show him who I am, that I am a great philosopher." It is seen by 
<A NAME="217"></A>these very things: why do you wish to show it by others? Do you not know 
<A NAME="218"></A>that Diogenes pointed out one of the sophists in this way by stretching 
<A NAME="219"></A>out his middle finger? And then when the man was wild with rage, "This," 
<A NAME="220"></A>he said, "is the certain person: I pointed him out to you." For a man is 
<A NAME="221"></A>not shown by the finger, as a stone or a piece of wood: but when any person 
<A NAME="222"></A>shows the man s principles, then he shows him as a man.
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR>Let us look at your principles also. For is it not plain that you 
<A NAME="224"></A>value not at all your own will, but you look externally to things which 
<A NAME="225"></A>are independent of your will? For instance, what will a certain person 
<A NAME="226"></A>say? and what will people think of you? will you be considered a man of 
<A NAME="227"></A>learning; have you read Chrysippus or Antipater? for if you have read Archedemus 
<A NAME="228"></A>also, you have everything. Why are you still uneasy lest you should not 
<A NAME="229"></A>show us who you are? Would you let me tell you what manner of man you have 
<A NAME="230"></A>shown us that you are? You have exhibited yourself to us as a mean fellow, 
<A NAME="231"></A>querulous, passionate, cowardly, finding fault with everything, blaming 
<A NAME="232"></A>everybody, never quiet, vain: this is what you have exhibited to us. Go 
<A NAME="233"></A>away now and read Archedemus; then, if a mouse should leap down and make 
<A NAME="234"></A>a noise, you are a dead man. For such a death awaits you as it did- what 
<A NAME="235"></A>was the man's name?- Crinis; and he too was proud, because he understood 
<A NAME="236"></A>Archedemus.
<A NAME="237"></A><BR><BR>Wretch, will you not dismiss these things that do not concern you 
<A NAME="238"></A>at all? These things are suitable to those who are able to learn them without 
<A NAME="239"></A>perturbation, to those who can say: "I am not subject to anger, to grief, 
<A NAME="240"></A>to envy: I am not hindered, I am not restrained. What remains for me? I 
<A NAME="241"></A>have leisure, I am tranquil: let us see how we must deal with sophistical 
<A NAME="242"></A>arguments; let us see how when a man has accepted an hypothesis he shall 
<A NAME="243"></A>not be led away to anything absurd." To them such things belong. To those 
<A NAME="244"></A>who are happy it is appropriate to light a fire, to dine; if they choose, 
<A NAME="245"></A>both to sing and to dance. But when the vessel is sinking, you come to 
<A NAME="246"></A>me and hoist the sails.

<A NAME="247"></A><B>Chapter 3</B>

<A NAME="248"></A><BR><BR>What is the matter on which a good man should he employed, and 
<A NAME="249"></A>in what we ought chiefly to practice ourselves
<A NAME="250"></A><BR><BR>The material for the wise and good man is his own ruling faculty: 
<A NAME="251"></A>and the body is the material for the physician and the aliptes; the land 
<A NAME="252"></A>is the matter for the husbandman. The business of the wise and good man 
<A NAME="253"></A>is to use appearances conformably to nature: and as it is the nature of 
<A NAME="254"></A>every soul to assent to the truth, to dissent from the false, and to remain 
<A NAME="255"></A>in suspense as to that which is uncertain; so it is its nature to be moved 
<A NAME="256"></A>toward the desire of the good, and to aversion from the evil; and with 
<A NAME="257"></A>respect to that which is neither good nor bad it feels indifferent. For 
<A NAME="258"></A>as the money-changer is not allowed to reject Caesar's coin, nor the seller 
<A NAME="259"></A>of herbs, but if you show the coin, whether he chooses or not, he must 
<A NAME="260"></A>give up what is sold for the coin; so it is also in the matter of the soul. 
<A NAME="261"></A>When the good appears, it immediately attracts to itself; the evil repels 
<A NAME="262"></A>from itself. But the soul will never reject the manifest appearance of 
<A NAME="263"></A>the good, any more than persons will reject Caesar's coin. On this principle 
<A NAME="264"></A>depends every movement both of man and God.
<A NAME="265"></A><BR><BR>For this reason the good is preferred to every intimate relationship. 
<A NAME="266"></A>There is no intimate relationship between me and my father, but there is 
<A NAME="267"></A>between me and the good. "Are you so hard-hearted?" Yes, for such is my 
<A NAME="268"></A>nature; and this is the coin which God has given me. For this reason, if 
<A NAME="269"></A>the good is something different from the beautiful and the just, both father 
<A NAME="270"></A>is gone, and brother and country, and everything. But shall I overlook 
<A NAME="271"></A>my own good, in order that you may have it, and shall I give it up to you? 
<A NAME="272"></A>Why? "I am your father." But you are not my good. "I am your brother." 
<A NAME="273"></A>But you are not my good. But if we place the good in a right determination 
<A NAME="274"></A>of the will, the very observance of the relations of life is good, and 
<A NAME="275"></A>accordingly he who gives up any external things obtains that which is good. 
<A NAME="276"></A>Your father takes away your property. But he does not injure you. Your 
<A NAME="277"></A>brother will have the greater part of the estate in land. Let him have 
<A NAME="278"></A>as much as he chooses. Will he then have a greater share of modesty, of 
<A NAME="279"></A>fidelity, of brotherly affection? For who will eject you from this possession? 
<A NAME="280"></A>Not even Zeus, for neither has he chosen to do so; but he has made this 
<A NAME="281"></A>in my own power, and he has given it to me just as he possessed it himself, 
<A NAME="282"></A>free from hindrance, compulsion, and impediment. When then the coin which 
<A NAME="283"></A>another uses is a different coin, if a man presents this coin, he receives 
<A NAME="284"></A>that which is sold for it. Suppose that there comes into the province a 
<A NAME="285"></A>thievish proconsul, what coin does he use? Silver coin. Show it to him, 
<A NAME="286"></A>and carry off what you please. Suppose one comes who is an adulterer: what 
<A NAME="287"></A>coin does he use? Little girls. "Take," a man says, "the coin, and sell 
<A NAME="288"></A>me the small thing." "Give," says the seller, "and buy." Another is eager 
<A NAME="289"></A>to possess boys. Give him the coin, and receive what you wish. Another 
<A NAME="290"></A>is fond of hunting: give him a fine nag or a dog. Though he groans and 
<A NAME="291"></A>laments, he will sell for it that which you want. For another compels him 
<A NAME="292"></A>from within, he who has fixed this coin.
<A NAME="293"></A><BR><BR>Against this kind of thing chiefly a man should exercise himself. 
<A NAME="294"></A>As soon as you go out in the morning, examine every man whom you see, every 
<A NAME="295"></A>man whom you hear; answer as to a question, "What have you seen?" A handsome 
<A NAME="296"></A>man or woman? Apply the rule: Is this independent of the will, or dependent? 
<A NAME="297"></A>Independent. Take it away. What have you seen? A man lamenting over the 
<A NAME="298"></A>death of a child. Apply the rule. Death is a thing independent of the will. 
<A NAME="299"></A>Take it away. Has the proconsul met you? Apply the rule. What kind of thing 
<A NAME="300"></A>is a proconsul's office? Independent of the will, or dependent on it? Independent. 
<A NAME="301"></A>Take this away also: it does not stand examination: cast it away: it is 
<A NAME="302"></A>nothing to you.
<A NAME="303"></A><BR><BR>If we practiced this and exercised ourselves in it daily from morning 
<A NAME="304"></A>to night, something indeed would be done. But now we are forthwith caught 
<A NAME="305"></A>half-asleep by every appearance, and it is only, if ever, that in the school 
<A NAME="306"></A>we are roused a little. Then when we go out, if we see a man lamenting, 
<A NAME="307"></A>we say, "He is undone." If we see a consul, we say, "He is happy." If we 
<A NAME="308"></A>see an exiled man, we say, "He is miserable." If we see a poor man, we 
<A NAME="309"></A>say, "He is wretched: he has nothing to eat."
<A NAME="310"></A><BR><BR>We ought then to eradicate these bad opinions, and to this end 
<A NAME="311"></A>we should direct all our efforts. For what is weeping and lamenting? Opinion. 
<A NAME="312"></A>What is bad fortune? Opinion. What is civil sedition, what is divided opinion, 
<A NAME="313"></A>what is blame, what is accusation, what is impiety, what is trifling? All 
<A NAME="314"></A>these things are opinions, and nothing more, and opinions about things 
<A NAME="315"></A>independent of the will, as if they were good and bad. Let a man transfer 
<A NAME="316"></A>these opinions to things dependent on the will, and I engage for him that 
<A NAME="317"></A>he will be firm and constant, whatever may be the state of things around 
<A NAME="318"></A>him. Such as is a dish of water, such is the soul. Such as is the ray of 
<A NAME="319"></A>light which falls on the water, such are the appearances. When the water 
<A NAME="320"></A>is moved, the ray also seems to be moved, yet it is not moved. And when, 
<A NAME="321"></A>then, a man is seized with giddiness, it is not the arts and the virtues 
<A NAME="322"></A>which are confounded, but the spirit on which they are impressed; but if 
<A NAME="323"></A>the spirit be restored to its settled state, those things also are 
<A NAME="324"></A>restored.

<A NAME="325"></A><B>Chapter 4</B>

<A NAME="326"></A><BR><BR>Against a person who showed his partisanship in an unseemly way 
<A NAME="327"></A>in a theatre
<A NAME="328"></A><BR><BR>The governor of Epirus having shown his favor to an actor in an 
<A NAME="329"></A>unseemly way and being publicly blamed on this account, and afterward having 
<A NAME="330"></A>reported to Epictetus that he was blamed and that he was vexed at those 
<A NAME="331"></A>who blamed him, Epictetus said: What harm have they been doing? These men 
<A NAME="332"></A>also were acting, as partisans, as you were doing. The governor replied, 
<A NAME="333"></A>"Does, then, any person show his partisanship in this way?" When they see 
<A NAME="334"></A>you, said Epictetus, who are their governor, a friend of Caesar and his 
<A NAME="335"></A>deputy, showing partisanship in this way, was it not to be expected that 
<A NAME="336"></A>they also should show their partisanship in the same way? for if it is 
<A NAME="337"></A>not right to show partisanship in this way, do not do so yourself; and 
<A NAME="338"></A>if it is right, why are you angry if they followed your example? For whom 
<A NAME="339"></A>have the many to imitate except you, who are their superiors, to whose 
<A NAME="340"></A>example should they look when they go to the theatre except yours? "See 
<A NAME="341"></A>how the deputy of Caesar looks on: he has cried out, and I too, then, will 
<A NAME="342"></A>cry out. He springs up from his seat, and I will spring up. His slaves 
<A NAME="343"></A>sit in various parts of the theatre and call out. I have no slaves, but 
<A NAME="344"></A>I will myself cry out as much as I can and as loud as all of them together." 
<A NAME="345"></A>You ought then to know when you enter the theatre that you enter as a rule 
<A NAME="346"></A>and example to the rest how they ought to look at the acting. Why then 
<A NAME="347"></A>did they blame you? Because every man hates that which is a hindrance to 
<A NAME="348"></A>him. They wished one person to be crowned; you wished another. They were 
<A NAME="349"></A>a hindrance to you, and you were a hindrance to them. You were found to 
<A NAME="350"></A>be the stronger; and they did what they could; they blamed that which hindered 
<A NAME="351"></A>them. What, then, would you have? That you should do what you please, and 
<A NAME="352"></A>they should not even say what they please? And what is the wonder? Do not 
<A NAME="353"></A>the husbandmen abuse Zeus when they are hindered by him? do not the sailors 
<A NAME="354"></A>abuse him? do they ever cease abusing Caesar? What then does not Zeus know? 
<A NAME="355"></A>is not what is said reported to Caesar? What, then, does he do? he knows 
<A NAME="356"></A>that, if he punished all who abuse him, he would have nobody to rule over. 
<A NAME="357"></A>What then? when you enter the theatre, you ought to say not, "Let Sophron 
<A NAME="358"></A>be crowned", but you ought to say this, "Come let me maintain my will in 
<A NAME="359"></A>this matter so that it shall be conformable to nature: no man is dearer 
<A NAME="360"></A>to me than myself. It would be ridiculous, then, for me to be hurt (injured) 
<A NAME="361"></A>in order that another who is an actor may be crowned." Whom then do I wish 
<A NAME="362"></A>to gain the prize? Why the actor who does gain the prize; and so he will 
<A NAME="363"></A>always gain the prize whom I wish to gain it. "But I wish Sophron to be 
<A NAME="364"></A>crowned." Celebrate as many games as you choose in your own house, Nemean, 
<A NAME="365"></A>Pythian, Isthmian, Olympian, and proclaim him victor. But in public do 
<A NAME="366"></A>not claim more than your due, nor attempt to appropriate to yourself what 
<A NAME="367"></A>belongs to all. If you do not consent to this, bear being abused: for when 
<A NAME="368"></A>you do the same as the many, you put yourself on the same level with 
<A NAME="369"></A>them.

<A NAME="370"></A><B>Chapter 5</B>

<A NAME="371"></A><BR><BR>Against those who on account of sickness go away 
<A NAME="372"></A>home
<A NAME="373"></A><BR><BR>"I am sick here," said one of the pupils, "and I wish to return 
<A NAME="374"></A>home." At home, I suppose, you free from sickness. Do you not consider 
<A NAME="375"></A>whether you are doing, anything here which may be useful to the exercise 
<A NAME="376"></A>of your will, that it may be corrected? For if you are doing nothing toward 
<A NAME="377"></A>this end, it was to no purpose that you came. Go away. Look after your 
<A NAME="378"></A>affairs at home. For if your ruling power cannot be maintained in a state 
<A NAME="379"></A>conformable to nature, it is possible that your land can, that you will 
<A NAME="380"></A>he able to increase your money, you will take care of your father in his 
<A NAME="381"></A>old age, frequent the public place, hold magisterial office: being bad 
<A NAME="382"></A>you will do badly anything else that you have to do. But if you understand 
<A NAME="383"></A>yourself, and know that you are casting away certain bad opinions and adopting 
<A NAME="384"></A>others in their place, and if you have changed your state of life from 
<A NAME="385"></A>things which are not within your will to things which are within your will, 
<A NAME="386"></A>and if you ever say, "Alas!" you are not saying what you say on account 
<A NAME="387"></A>of your father, or your brother, but on account of yourself, do you still 
<A NAME="388"></A>allege your sickness? Do you not know that both disease and death must 
<A NAME="389"></A>surprise us while we are doing something? the husbandman while he is tilling 
<A NAME="390"></A>the ground, the sailor while he is on his voyage? what would you be doing 
<A NAME="391"></A>when death surprises you, for you must be surprised when you are doing 
<A NAME="392"></A>something? If you can be doing anything better than this when you are surprised, 
<A NAME="393"></A>do it. For I wish to be surprised by disease or death when I am looking 
<A NAME="394"></A>after nothing else than my that may be free from perturbation, own will 
<A NAME="395"></A>that I may be free from hindrance, free from compulsion, and in a state 
<A NAME="396"></A>of liberty. I wish to be found practicing these things that I may be able 
<A NAME="397"></A>to say to God, "Have I in any respect transgressed thy commands? have I 
<A NAME="398"></A>in any respect wrongly used the powers which Thou gavest me? have I misused 
<A NAME="399"></A>my perceptions or my preconceptions? have I ever blamed Thee? have I ever 
<A NAME="400"></A>found fault with Thy administration? I have been sick, because it was Thy 
<A NAME="401"></A>will, and so have others, but I was content to be sick. I have been poor 
<A NAME="402"></A>because it was Thy will, but I was content also. I have not filled a magisterial 
<A NAME="403"></A>office, because it was not Thy pleasure that I should: I have never desired 
<A NAME="404"></A>it. Hast Thou ever seen me for this reason discontented? have I not always 
<A NAME="405"></A>approached Thee with a cheerful countenance, ready to do Thy commands and 
<A NAME="406"></A>to obey Thy signals? Is it now Thy will that I should depart from the assemblage 
<A NAME="407"></A>of men? I depart. I give Thee all thanks that Thou hast allowed me to join 
<A NAME="408"></A>in this Thy assemblage of men and to see Thy works, and to comprehend this 
<A NAME="409"></A>Thy administration." May death surprise me while I am thinking of these 
<A NAME="410"></A>things, while I am thus writing and reading.
<A NAME="411"></A><BR><BR>"But my mother will not hold my head when I am sick." Go to your 
<A NAME="412"></A>mother then; for you are a fit person to have your head held when you are 
<A NAME="413"></A>sick. "But at home I used to lie down on a delicious bed." Go away to your 
<A NAME="414"></A>bed: indeed you are fit to lie on such a bed even when you are in health: 
<A NAME="415"></A>do not, then, lose what you can do there.
<A NAME="416"></A><BR><BR>But what does Socrates say? "As one man," he says, "is pleased 
<A NAME="417"></A>with improving his land, another with improving his horse, so I am daily 
<A NAME="418"></A>pleased in observing that I am growing better." "Better in what? in using 
<A NAME="419"></A>nice little words?" Man, do not say that. "In little matters of speculation?" 
<A NAME="420"></A>What are you saying? "And indeed I do not see what else there is on which 
<A NAME="421"></A>philosophers employ their time." Does it seem nothing to you to have never 
<A NAME="422"></A>found fault with any person, neither with God nor man? to have blamed nobody? 
<A NAME="423"></A>to carry the same face always in going out and coming in? This is what 
<A NAME="424"></A>Socrates knew, and yet he never said that he knew anything or taught anything. 
<A NAME="425"></A>But if any man asked for nice little words or little speculations, he would 
<A NAME="426"></A>carry him to Protagoras or to Hippias; and if any man came to ask for pot-herbs, 
<A NAME="427"></A>he would carry him to the gardener. Who then among you has this purpose? 
<A NAME="428"></A>for if indeed you had it, you would both be content in sickness, and in 
<A NAME="429"></A>hunger, and in death. If any among you has been in love with a charming 
<A NAME="430"></A>girl, he knows that I say what is true.

<A NAME="432"></A><BR><BR>Miscellaneous
<A NAME="433"></A><BR><BR>When some person asked him how it happened that since reason has 
<A NAME="434"></A>been more cultivated by the men of the present age, the progress made in 
<A NAME="435"></A>former times was greater. In what respect, he answered, has it been more 
<A NAME="436"></A>cultivated now, and in what respect was the progress greater then? For 
<A NAME="437"></A>in that in which it has now been more cultivated, in that also the progress 
<A NAME="438"></A>will now be found. At present it has been cultivated for the purpose of 
<A NAME="439"></A>resolving syllogisms, and progress is made. But in former times it was 
<A NAME="440"></A>cultivated for the purpose of maintaining the governing faculty in a condition 
<A NAME="441"></A>conformable to nature, and progress was made. Do not, then, mix things 
<A NAME="442"></A>which are different and do not expect, when you are laboring at one thing, 
<A NAME="443"></A>to make progress in another. But see if any man among us when he is intent 
<A NAME="444"></A>see I upon this, the keeping himself in a state conformable to nature and 
<A NAME="445"></A>living so always, does not make progress. For you will not find such a 
<A NAME="446"></A>man.
<A NAME="447"></A><BR><BR>The good man is invincible, for he does not enter the contest where 
<A NAME="448"></A>he is not stronger. If you want to have his land and all that is on it, 
<A NAME="449"></A>take the land; take his slaves, take his magisterial office, take his poor 
<A NAME="450"></A>body. But you will not make his desire fail in that which it seeks, nor 
<A NAME="451"></A>his aversion fall into that which he would avoid. The only contest into 
<A NAME="452"></A>which he enters is that about things which are within the power of his 
<A NAME="453"></A>will; how then will he not be invincible?
<A NAME="454"></A><BR><BR>Some person having asked him what is Common sense, Epictetus replied: 
<A NAME="455"></A>As that may be called a certain Common hearing which only distinguishes 
<A NAME="456"></A>vocal sounds, and that which distinguishes musical sounds is not Common, 
<A NAME="457"></A>but artificial; so there are certain things which men, who are not altogether 
<A NAME="458"></A>perverted, see by the common notions which all possess. Such a constitution 
<A NAME="459"></A>of the mind is named Common sense.
<A NAME="460"></A><BR><BR>It is not easy to exhort weak young men; for neither is it easy 
<A NAME="461"></A>to hold cheese with a hook. But those who have a good natural disposition, 
<A NAME="462"></A>even if you try to turn them aside, cling still more to reason. Wherefore 
<A NAME="463"></A>Rufus generally attempted to discourage, and he used this method as a test 
<A NAME="464"></A>of those who had a good natural disposition and those who had not. "For," 
<A NAME="465"></A>it was his habit to say, "as a stone, if you cast it upward, will be brought 
<A NAME="466"></A>down to the earth by its own nature, so the man whose mind is naturally 
<A NAME="467"></A>good, the more you repel him, the more he turns toward that to which he 
<A NAME="468"></A>is naturally inclined."

<A NAME="469"></A><B>Chapter 7</B>

<A NAME="470"></A><BR><BR>To the administrator of the free cities who was an 
<A NAME="471"></A>Epicurean
<A NAME="472"></A><BR><BR>When the administrator came to visit him, and the man was an Epicurean, 
<A NAME="473"></A>Epictetus said: It is proper for us who are not philosophers to inquire 
<A NAME="474"></A>of you who are philosophers, as those who come to a strange city inquire 
<A NAME="475"></A>of the citizens and those who are acquainted with it, what is the best 
<A NAME="476"></A>thing in the world, in order that we also, after inquiry, may go in quest 
<A NAME="477"></A>of that which is best and look at it, as strangers do with the things in 
<A NAME="478"></A>cities. For that there are three things which relate to man, soul, body, 
<A NAME="479"></A>and things external, scarcely any man denies. It remains for you philosophers 
<A NAME="480"></A>to answer what is the best. What shall we say to men? Is the flesh the 
<A NAME="481"></A>best? and was it for this that Maximus sailed as far as Cassiope in winter 
<A NAME="482"></A>with his son, and accompanied him that he might be gratified in the flesh? 
<A NAME="483"></A>Then the man said that it was not, and added, "Far be that from him." Is 
<A NAME="484"></A>it not fit then, Epictetus said, to be actively employed about the best? 
<A NAME="485"></A>"It is certainly of all things the most fit." What, then, do we possess 
<A NAME="486"></A>which is better than the flesh? "The soul," he replied. And the good things 
<A NAME="487"></A>of the best, are they better, or the good things of the worse? "The good 
<A NAME="488"></A>things of the best." And are the good things of the best within the power 
<A NAME="489"></A>of the will or not within the power of the will? "They are within the power 
<A NAME="490"></A>of the will." Is, then, the pleasure of the soul a thing within the power 
<A NAME="491"></A>of the will? "It is," he replied. And on what shall this pleasure depend? 
<A NAME="492"></A>On itself? But that cannot be conceived: for there must first exist a certain 
<A NAME="493"></A>substance or nature of good, by obtaining which we shall have pleasure 
<A NAME="494"></A>in the soul. He assented to this also. On what, then, shall we depend for 
<A NAME="495"></A>this pleasure of the soul? for if it shall depend on things of the soul, 
<A NAME="496"></A>the substance of the good is discovered; for good cannot be one thing, 
<A NAME="497"></A>and that at which we are rationally delighted another thing; nor if that 
<A NAME="498"></A>which precedes is not good, can that which comes after be good, for in 
<A NAME="499"></A>order that the thing which comes after may be good, that which precedes 
<A NAME="500"></A>must be good. But you would not affirm this, if you are in your right mind, 
<A NAME="501"></A>for you would then say what is inconsistent both with Epicurus and the 
<A NAME="502"></A>rest of your doctrines. It remains, then, that the pleasure of the soul 
<A NAME="503"></A>is in the pleasure from things of the body: and again that those bodily 
<A NAME="504"></A>things must be the things which precede and the substance of the 
<A NAME="505"></A>good.
<A NAME="506"></A><BR><BR>For this reason Maximus acted foolishly if he made the voyage for 
<A NAME="507"></A>any other reason than for the sake of the flesh, that is, for the sake 
<A NAME="508"></A>of the best. And also a man acts foolishly if he abstains from that which 
<A NAME="509"></A>belongs to others, when he is a judge and able to take it. But, if you 
<A NAME="510"></A>please, let us consider this only, how this thing may be done secretly, 
<A NAME="511"></A>and safely, and so that no man will know it. For not even does Epicurus 
<A NAME="512"></A>himself declare stealing to be bad, but he admits that detection is; and 
<A NAME="513"></A>because it is impossible to have security against detection, for this reason 
<A NAME="514"></A>he says, "Do not steal." But I say to you that if stealing is done cleverly 
<A NAME="515"></A>and cautiously, we shall not be detected: further also we have powerful 
<A NAME="516"></A>friends in Rome both men and women, and the Hellenes are weak, and no man 
<A NAME="517"></A>will venture to go up to Rome for the purpose. Why do you refrain from 
<A NAME="518"></A>your own good? This is senseless, foolish. But even if you tell me that 
<A NAME="519"></A>you do refrain, I will not believe you. For as it is impossible to assent 
<A NAME="520"></A>to that which appears false, and to turn away from that which is true, 
<A NAME="521"></A>so it is impossible to abstain from that which appears good. But wealth 
<A NAME="522"></A>is a good thing, and certainly most efficient in producing pleasure. Why 
<A NAME="523"></A>will you not acquire wealth? And why should we not corrupt our neighbor's 
<A NAME="524"></A>wife, if we can do it without detection? and if the husband foolishly prates 
<A NAME="525"></A>about the matter, why not pitch him out of the house? If you would be a 
<A NAME="526"></A>philosopher such as you ought to be, if a perfect philosopher, if consistent 
<A NAME="527"></A>with your own doctrines. If you would not, you will not differ at all from 
<A NAME="528"></A>us who are called Stoics; for we also say one thing, but we do another: 
<A NAME="529"></A>we talk of the things which are beautiful, but we do what is base. But 
<A NAME="530"></A>you will be perverse in the contrary way, teaching what is bad, practicing 
<A NAME="531"></A>what is good.
<A NAME="532"></A><BR><BR>In the name of God, are you thinking of a city of Epicureans? "I 
<A NAME="533"></A>do not marry." "Nor I, for a man ought not to marry; nor ought we to beget 
<A NAME="534"></A>children, nor engage in public matters." What then will happen? whence 
<A NAME="535"></A>will the citizens come? who will bring them up? who will be governor of 
<A NAME="536"></A>the youth, who preside wi over gymnastic exercises? and in what also will 
<A NAME="537"></A>the teacher instruct them? will he teach them what the Lacedaemonians were 
<A NAME="538"></A>taught, or what the Athenians were taught? Come take a young man, bring 
<A NAME="539"></A>him up according to your doctrines. The doctrines are bad, subversive of 
<A NAME="540"></A>a state, pernicious to families, and not becoming to women. Dismiss them, 
<A NAME="541"></A>man. You live in a chief city: it is your duty to be a magistrate, to judge 
<A NAME="542"></A>justly, to abstain from that which belongs to others; no woman ought to 
<A NAME="543"></A>seem beautiful to you except your own wife, and no youth, no vessel of 
<A NAME="544"></A>silver, no vessel of gold. Seek for doctrines which are consistent with 
<A NAME="545"></A>what I say, and, by making them your guide, you will with pleasure abstain 
<A NAME="546"></A>from things which have such persuasive power to lead us and overpower us. 
<A NAME="547"></A>But if to the persuasive power of these things, we also devise such a philosophy 
<A NAME="548"></A>as this which helps to push us on toward them and strengthens us to this 
<A NAME="549"></A>end, what will be the consequence? In a piece of toreutic art which is 
<A NAME="550"></A>the best part? the silver or the workmanship? The substance of the hand 
<A NAME="551"></A>is the flesh; but the work of the hand is the principal part. The duties 
<A NAME="552"></A>then are also three; those which are directed toward the existence of a 
<A NAME="553"></A>thing; those which are directed toward its existence in a particular kind; 
<A NAME="554"></A>and third, the chief or leading things themselves. So also in man we ought 
<A NAME="555"></A>not to value the material, the poor flesh, but the principal. What are 
<A NAME="556"></A>these? Engaging in public business, marrying, begetting children, venerating 
<A NAME="557"></A>God, taking care of parents, and, generally, having desires, aversions, 
<A NAME="558"></A>pursuits of things and avoidances, in the way in which we ought to do these 
<A NAME="559"></A>things, and according to our nature. And how are we constituted by nature? 
<A NAME="560"></A>Free, noble, modest: for what other animal blushes? what other is capable 
<A NAME="561"></A>of receiving the appearance of shame? and we are so constituted by nature 
<A NAME="562"></A>as to subject pleasure to these things, as a minister, a servant, in order 
<A NAME="563"></A>that it may call forth our activity, in order that it may keep us constant 
<A NAME="564"></A>in acts which are conformable to nature.
<A NAME="565"></A><BR><BR>"But I am rich and I want nothing." Why, then, do you pretend to 
<A NAME="566"></A>be a philosopher? Your golden and your silver vessels are enough for you. 
<A NAME="567"></A>What need have you of principles? "But I am also a judge of the Greeks." 
<A NAME="568"></A>Do you know how to judge? Who taught you to know? "Caesar wrote to me a 
<A NAME="569"></A>codicil." Let him write and give you a commission to judge of music; and 
<A NAME="570"></A>what will be the use of it to you? Still how did you become a judge? whose 
<A NAME="571"></A>hand did you kiss? the hand of Symphorus or Numenius? Before whose bedchamber 
<A NAME="572"></A>have you slept? To whom have you sent gifts? Then do you not see that to 
<A NAME="573"></A>be a judge is just of the same value as Numenius is? "But I can throw into 
<A NAME="574"></A>prison any man whom I please." So you can do with a stone. "But I can beat 
<A NAME="575"></A>with sticks whom I please." So you may an ass. This is not a governing 
<A NAME="576"></A>of men. Govern us as rational animals: show us what is profitable to us, 
<A NAME="577"></A>and we will follow it: show us what is unprofitable, and we will turn away 
<A NAME="578"></A>from it. Make us imitators of yourself, as Socrates made men imitators 
<A NAME="579"></A>of himself. For he was like a governor of men, who made them subject to 
<A NAME="580"></A>him their desires, their aversion, their movements toward an object and 
<A NAME="581"></A>their turning away from it. "Do this: do not do this: if you do not obey, 
<A NAME="582"></A>I will throw you into prison." This is not governing men like rational 
<A NAME="583"></A>animals. But I: As Zeus has ordained, so act: if you do not act so, you 
<A NAME="584"></A>will feel the penalty, you will be punished. What will be the punishment? 
<A NAME="585"></A>Nothing else than not having done your duty: you will lose the character 
<A NAME="586"></A>of fidelity, modesty, propriety. Do not look for greater penalties than 
<A NAME="587"></A>these.

<A NAME="589"></A><BR><BR>How we must exercise ourselves against appearances
<A NAME="590"></A><BR><BR>As we exercise ourselves against sophistical questions, so we ought 
<A NAME="591"></A>to exercise ourselves daily against appearances; for these appearances 
<A NAME="592"></A>also propose questions to us. "A certain person son is dead." Answer: the 
<A NAME="593"></A>thing is not within the power of the will: it is not an evil. "A father 
<A NAME="594"></A>has disinherited a certain son. What do you think of it?" It is a thing 
<A NAME="595"></A>beyond the power of the will, not an evil. "Caesar has condemned a person." 
<A NAME="596"></A>It is a thing beyond the power of the will, not an evil. "The man is afflicted 
<A NAME="597"></A>at this." Affliction is a thing which depends on the will: it is an evil. 
<A NAME="598"></A>He has borne the condemnation bravely." That is a thing within the power 
<A NAME="599"></A>of the will: it is a good. If we train ourselves in this manner, we shall 
<A NAME="600"></A>make progress; for we shall never assent to anything of which there is 
<A NAME="601"></A>not an appearance capable of being comprehended. Your son is dead. What 
<A NAME="602"></A>has happened? Your son is dead. Nothing more? Nothing. Your ship is lost. 
<A NAME="603"></A>What has happened? Your ship is lost. A man has been led to prison. What 
<A NAME="604"></A>has happened? He has been led to prison. But that herein he has fared badly, 
<A NAME="605"></A>every man adds from his own opinion. "But Zeus," you say, "does not do 
<A NAME="606"></A>right in these matters." Why? because he has made you capable of endurance? 
<A NAME="607"></A>because he has made you magnanimous? because he has taken from that which 
<A NAME="608"></A>befalls you the power of being evil? because it is in your power to be 
<A NAME="609"></A>happy while you are suffering what you suffer; because he has opened the 
<A NAME="610"></A>door to you, when things do not please you? Man, go out and do not 
<A NAME="611"></A>complain.
<A NAME="612"></A><BR><BR>Hear how the Romans feel toward philosophers, if you would like 
<A NAME="613"></A>to know. Italicus, who was the most in repute of the philosophers, once 
<A NAME="614"></A>when I was present being, vexed with his own friends and as if he was suffering 
<A NAME="615"></A>something intolerable said, "I cannot bear it, you are killing me: you 
<A NAME="616"></A>will make me such as that man is"; pointing to me.

<A NAME="617"></A><B>Chapter 9</B>

<A NAME="618"></A><BR><BR>To a certain rhetorician who was going up to Rome on a 
<A NAME="619"></A>suit
<A NAME="620"></A><BR><BR>When a certain person came to him, who was going up to Rome on 
<A NAME="621"></A>account of a suit which had regard to his rank, Epictetus inquired the 
<A NAME="622"></A>reason of his going to Rome, and the man then asked what he thought about 
<A NAME="623"></A>the matter. Epictetus replied: If you ask me what you will do in Rome, 
<A NAME="624"></A>whether you will succeed or fall, I have no rule about this. But if you 
<A NAME="625"></A>ask me how you will fare, I can tell you: if you have right opinions, you 
<A NAME="626"></A>will fare well; if they are false, you will fare ill. For to every man 
<A NAME="627"></A>the cause of his acting is opinion. For what is the reason why you desired 
<A NAME="628"></A>to be elected governor of the Cnossians? Your opinion. What is the reason 
<A NAME="629"></A>that you are now going up to Rome? Your opinion. And going in winter, and 
<A NAME="630"></A>with danger and expense. "I must go." What tells you this? Your opinion. 
<A NAME="631"></A>Then if opinions are the causes of all actions, and a man has bad opinions, 
<A NAME="632"></A>such as the cause may be, such also is the effect. Have we then all sound 
<A NAME="633"></A>opinions, both you and your adversary? And how do you differ? But have 
<A NAME="634"></A>you sounder opinions than your adversary? Why? You think so. And so does 
<A NAME="635"></A>he think that his opinions are better; and so do madmen. This is a bad 
<A NAME="636"></A>criterion. But show to me that you have made some inquiry into your opinions 
<A NAME="637"></A>and have taken some pains about them. And as now you are sailing to Rome 
<A NAME="638"></A>in order to become governor of the Cnossians, and you are not content to 
<A NAME="639"></A>stay at home with the honors which you had, but you desire something greater 
<A NAME="640"></A>and more conspicuous, so when did you ever make a voyage for the purpose 
<A NAME="641"></A>of examining your own opinions, and casting them out, if you have any that 
<A NAME="642"></A>are bad? Whom have you approached for this purpose? What time have you 
<A NAME="643"></A>fixed for it? What age? Go over the times of your life by yourself, if 
<A NAME="644"></A>you are ashamed of me. When you were a boy, did you examine your own opinions? 
<A NAME="645"></A>and did you not then, as you do all things now, do as you did do? and when 
<A NAME="646"></A>you were become a youth and attended the rhetoricians, and yourself practiced 
<A NAME="647"></A>rhetoric, what did you imagine that you were deficient in? And when you 
<A NAME="648"></A>were a young man and engaged in public matters, and pleaded causes yourself, 
<A NAME="649"></A>and were gaining reputation, who then seemed your equal? And when would 
<A NAME="650"></A>you have submitted to any man examining and show that your opinions are 
<A NAME="651"></A>bad? What, then, do you wish me to say to you? "Help me in this matter." 
<A NAME="652"></A>I have no theorem (rule) for this. Nor have you, if you came to me for 
<A NAME="653"></A>this purpose, come to me as a philosopher, but as to a seller of vegetables 
<A NAME="654"></A>or a shoemaker. "For what purpose then have philosophers theorems?" For 
<A NAME="655"></A>this purpose, that whatever may happen, our ruling faculty may be and continue 
<A NAME="656"></A>to be conformable to nature. Does this seem to you a small thing? "No; 
<A NAME="657"></A>but the greatest." What then? does it need only a short time? and is it 
<A NAME="658"></A>possible to seize it as you pass by? If you can, seize 
<A NAME="659"></A>it.
<A NAME="660"></A><BR><BR>Then you will say, "I met with Epictetus as I should meet with 
<A NAME="661"></A>a stone or a statue": for you saw me, and nothing more. But he meets with 
<A NAME="662"></A>a man as a man, who learns his opinions, and in his turn shows his own. 
<A NAME="663"></A>Learn my opinions: show me yours; and then say that you have visited me. 
<A NAME="664"></A>Let us examine one another: if I have any bad opinion, take it away; if 
<A NAME="665"></A>you have any, show it. This is the meaning of meeting with a philosopher. 
<A NAME="666"></A>"Not so, but this is only a passing visit, and while we are hiring the 
<A NAME="667"></A>vessel, we can also see Epictetus. Let us see what he says." Then you go 
<A NAME="668"></A>away and say: "Epictetus was nothing: he used solecisms and spoke in a 
<A NAME="669"></A>barbarous way." For of what else do you come as judges? "Well, but a man 
<A NAME="670"></A>may say to me, "If I attend to such matters, I shall have no land, as you 
<A NAME="671"></A>have none; I shall have no silver cups as you have none, nor fine beasts 
<A NAME="672"></A>as you have none." In answer to this it is perhaps sufficient to say: I 
<A NAME="673"></A>have no need of such things: but if you possess many things you have need 
<A NAME="674"></A>of others: whether you choose or not, you are poorer than I am. "What then 
<A NAME="675"></A>have I need of?" Of that which you have not: of firmness, of a mind which 
<A NAME="676"></A>is conformable to nature, of being free from perturbation. Whether I have 
<A NAME="677"></A>a patron or not, what is that to me? but it is something to you. I am richer 
<A NAME="678"></A>than you: I am not anxious what Caesar will think of me: for this reason, 
<A NAME="679"></A>I flatter no man. This is what I possess instead of vessels of silver and 
<A NAME="680"></A>gold. You have utensils of gold; but your discourse, your opinions, your 
<A NAME="681"></A>assents, your movements, your desires are of earthen ware. But when I have 
<A NAME="682"></A>these things conformable to nature, why should I not employ my studies 
<A NAME="683"></A>also upon reason? for I have leisure: my mind is not distracted. What shall 
<A NAME="684"></A>I do, since I have no distraction? What more suitable to a man have I than 
<A NAME="685"></A>this? When you have nothing to do, you are disturbed, you go to the theatre 
<A NAME="686"></A>or you wander about without a purpose. Why should not the philosopher labour 
<A NAME="687"></A>to improve his reason? You employ yourself about crystal vessels: I employ 
<A NAME="688"></A>myself about the syllogism named "The Living": you about myrrhine vessels; 
<A NAME="689"></A>I employ myself about the syllogism named "The Denying." To you everything 
<A NAME="690"></A>appears small that you possess: to me all that I have appears great. Your 
<A NAME="691"></A>desire is insatiable: mine is satisfied. To (children) who put their hand 
<A NAME="692"></A>into a narrow necked earthen vessel and bring out figs and nuts, this happens; 
<A NAME="693"></A>if they fill the hand, they cannot take it out, and then they cry. Drop 
<A NAME="694"></A>a few of them and you will draw things out. And do you part with your desires: 
<A NAME="695"></A>do not desire many things and you will have what you 
<A NAME="696"></A>want.

<A NAME="698"></A><BR><BR>In what manner we ought to bear sickness
<A NAME="699"></A><BR><BR>When the need of each opinion comes, we ought to have it in readiness: 
<A NAME="700"></A>on the occasion of breakfast, such as relate to breakfast; in the bath, 
<A NAME="701"></A>those that concern the bath; in bed, those that concern 
<A NAME="702"></A>bed.
<A NAME="703"></A><BR><BR><B>Let sleep not come upon thy languid eyes</B> <B>Before each 
<A NAME="704"></A>daily action thou hast scann'd;</B> <B>What's done amiss, what done, what 
<A NAME="705"></A>left undone;</B> <B>From first to last examine all, and then</B> <B>Blame 
<A NAME="706"></A>what is wrong in what is right rejoice.</B>
<A NAME="707"></A><BR><BR>And we ought to retain these verses in such way that we may use 
<A NAME="708"></A>them, not that we may utter them aloud, as when we exclaim "Paean Apollo." 
<A NAME="709"></A>Again in fever we should have ready such opinions as concern a fever; and 
<A NAME="710"></A>we ought not, as soon as the fever begins, to lose and forget all. (A man 
<A NAME="711"></A>who has a fever) may "If I philosophize any longer, may I be hanged: wherever 
<A NAME="712"></A>I go, I must take care of the poor body, that a fever may not come." But 
<A NAME="713"></A>what is philosophizing? Is it not a preparation against events which may 
<A NAME="714"></A>happen? Do you not understand that you are saying something of this kind? 
<A NAME="715"></A>"If I shall still prepare myself to bear with patience what happens, may 
<A NAME="716"></A>I be hanged." But this is just as if a man after receiving blows should 
<A NAME="717"></A>give up the Pancratium. In the Pancratium it is in our power to desist 
<A NAME="718"></A>and not to receive blows. But in the other matter, we give up philosophy, 
<A NAME="719"></A>what shall we gain I gain? What then should a man say on the occasion of 
<A NAME="720"></A>each painful thing? "It was for this that I exercised myself, for this 
<A NAME="721"></A>I disciplined myself." God says to you, "Give me a proof that you have 
<A NAME="722"></A>duly practiced athletics, that you have eaten what you ought, that you 
<A NAME="723"></A>have been exercised, that you have obeyed the aliptes." Then do you show 
<A NAME="724"></A>yourself weak when the time for action comes? Now is the time for the fever. 
<A NAME="725"></A>Let it be borne well. Now is the time for thirst, well; now is the time 
<A NAME="726"></A>for hunger, bear it well. Is it not in your power? who shall hinder you? 
<A NAME="727"></A>The physician will hinder you from drinking; but he cannot prevent you 
<A NAME="728"></A>from bearing thirst well: and he will hinder you from eating; but he cannot 
<A NAME="729"></A>prevent you from bearing hunger well.
<A NAME="730"></A><BR><BR>"But I cannot attend to my philosophical studies." And for what 
<A NAME="731"></A>purpose do you follow them? Slave, is it not that you may be happy, that 
<A NAME="732"></A>you may be constant, is it not that you may be in a state conformable to 
<A NAME="733"></A>nature and live so? What hinders you when you have a fever from having 
<A NAME="734"></A>your ruling faculty conformable to nature? Here is the proof of the thing, 
<A NAME="735"></A>here is the test of the philosopher. For this also is a part of life, like 
<A NAME="736"></A>walking, like sailing, like journeying by land, so also is fever. Do you 
<A NAME="737"></A>read when you are walking? No. Nor do you when you have a fever. if you 
<A NAME="738"></A>walk about well, you have all that belongs to a man who walks. If you bear 
<A NAME="739"></A>fever well, you have all that belongs to a man in a fever. What is it to 
<A NAME="740"></A>bear a fever well? Not to blame God or man; not to be afflicted it that 
<A NAME="741"></A>which happens, to expect death well and nobly, to do what must be done: 
<A NAME="742"></A>when the physician comes in, not to be frightened at what he says; nor 
<A NAME="743"></A>if he says, "You are doing well," to be overjoyed. For what good has he 
<A NAME="744"></A>told you? and when you were in health, what good was that to you? And even 
<A NAME="745"></A>if he says, "You are in a bad way," do not despond. For what is it to be 
<A NAME="746"></A>ill? is it that you are near the severance of the soul and the body? what 
<A NAME="747"></A>harm is there in this? If you are not near now, will you not afterward 
<A NAME="748"></A>be near? Is the world going to be turned upside down when you are dead? 
<A NAME="749"></A>Why then do you flatter the physician? Why do you say, "If you please, 
<A NAME="750"></A>master, I shall be well"? Why do you give him an opportunity of raising 
<A NAME="751"></A>his eyebrows? Do you not value a physician, as you do a shoemaker when 
<A NAME="752"></A>he is measuring your foot, or a carpenter when he is building your house, 
<A NAME="753"></A>and so treat the physician as to the body which is not yours, but by nature 
<A NAME="754"></A>dead? He who has a fever has an opportunity of doing this: if he does these 
<A NAME="755"></A>things, he has what belongs to him. For it is not the business of a philosopher 
<A NAME="756"></A>to look after these externals, neither his wine nor his oil nor his poor 
<A NAME="757"></A>body, but his own ruling power. But as to externals how must he act? so 
<A NAME="758"></A>far as not to be careless about them. Where then is there reason for fear? 
<A NAME="759"></A>where is there, then, still reason for anger, and of fear about what belongs 
<A NAME="760"></A>to others, about things which are of no value? For we ought to have these 
<A NAME="761"></A>two principles in readiness: that except the will nothing is good nor bad; 
<A NAME="762"></A>and that we ought not to lead events, but to follow them. "My brother ought 
<A NAME="763"></A>not to have behaved thus to me." No; but he will see to that: and, however 
<A NAME="764"></A>he may behave, I will conduct myself toward him as I ought. For this is 
<A NAME="765"></A>my own business: that belongs to another; no man can prevent this, the 
<A NAME="766"></A>other thing can be hindered.

<A NAME="768"></A><BR><BR>Certain miscellaneous matters

<A NAME="773"></A>evil, let him grieve, let him lament, let him weep, let him be unhappy. 
<A NAME="774"></A>And yet, though so severely punished, we cannot desist.
<A NAME="775"></A><BR><BR>Remember what the poet says about the stranger:
<A NAME="776"></A><BR><BR><B>Stranger, I must not, e'en if a worse man come.</B> This, then,

<A NAME="778"></A>you should come, treat a father unworthily-, for all are from paternal 
<A NAME="779"></A>Zeus." And of a brother, "For all are from the Zeus who presides over kindred."

<A NAME="785"></A>nature and adapted to cause admiration, for, if we do so, we, who call 
<A NAME="786"></A>ourselves philosophers, shall not differ at all from jugglers. For it is 
<A NAME="787"></A>difficult even to walk on a rope; and not only difficult, but it is also 
<A NAME="788"></A>dangerous. Ought we for this reason to practice walking on a rope, or setting 
<A NAME="789"></A>up a palm tree, or embracing statues? By no means. Everything, which is 
<A NAME="790"></A>difficult and dangerous is not suitable for practice; but that is suitable 
<A NAME="791"></A>which conduces to the working out of that which is proposed to us as a 
<A NAME="792"></A>thing to be worked out. To live with desire and aversion, free from restraint. 
<A NAME="793"></A>And what is this? Neither to be disappointed in that which you desire, 
<A NAME="794"></A>nor to fall into anything which you would avoid. Toward this object, then, 
<A NAME="795"></A>exercise ought to tend. For, since it is not possible to have your desire 
<A NAME="796"></A>not disappointed and your aversion free from falling into that which you 
<A NAME="797"></A>would avoid, great and constant practice you must know that if you allow 
<A NAME="798"></A>your desire and aversion to turn to things which are not within the power 
<A NAME="799"></A>of the will, you will neither have your desire capable of attaining your 
<A NAME="800"></A>object, nor your aversion free from the power of avoiding that which you 
<A NAME="801"></A>would avoid. And since strong habit leads, and we are accustomed to employ 
<A NAME="802"></A>desire and aversion only to things which are not within the power of our 
<A NAME="803"></A>will, we ought to oppose to this habit a contrary habit, and where there 
<A NAME="804"></A>is great slipperiness in the appearances, there to oppose the habit of 
<A NAME="805"></A>exercise.
<A NAME="806"></A><BR><BR>I am rather inclined to pleasure: I will incline to the contrary 
<A NAME="807"></A>side above measure for the sake of exercise. I am averse to pain: I will 
<A NAME="808"></A>rub and exercise against this the appearances which are presented to me 
<A NAME="809"></A>for the purpose of withdrawing my aversion from every such thing. For who 
<A NAME="810"></A>is a practitioner in exercise? He who practices not using his desire, and 
<A NAME="811"></A>applies his aversion only to things which are within the power of his will, 
<A NAME="812"></A>and practices most in the things which are difficult to conquer. For this 
<A NAME="813"></A>reason one man must practice himself more against one thing and another 
<A NAME="814"></A>against another thing. What, then, is it to the purpose to set up a palm 
<A NAME="815"></A>tree, or to carry about a tent of skins, or a mortar and a pestle? Practice, 
<A NAME="816"></A>man, if you are irritable, to endure if you are abused, not to be vexed 
<A NAME="817"></A>if you are treated with dishonour. Then you will make so much progress 
<A NAME="818"></A>that, even if a man strikes you, you will say to yourself, "Imagine that 
<A NAME="819"></A>you have embraced a statue": then also exercise yourself to use wine properly 
<A NAME="820"></A>so as not to drink much, for in this also there are men who foolishly practice 
<A NAME="821"></A>themselves; but first of all you should abstain from it, and abstain from 
<A NAME="822"></A>a young girl and dainty cakes. Then at last, if occasion presents itself, 
<A NAME="823"></A>for the purpose of trying yourself at a proper time, you will descend into 
<A NAME="824"></A>the arena to know if appearances overpower you as they did formerly. But 
<A NAME="825"></A>at first fly far from that which is stronger than yourself: the contest 
<A NAME="826"></A>is unequal between a charming young girl and a beginner in philosophy. 
<A NAME="827"></A>"The earthen pitcher," as the saying is, "and the rock do not 
<A NAME="828"></A>agree."
<A NAME="829"></A><BR><BR>After the desire and the aversion comes the second topic of the 
<A NAME="830"></A>movements toward action and the withdrawals from it; that you may be obedient 
<A NAME="831"></A>to reason, that you do nothing out of season or place, or contrary to any 
<A NAME="832"></A>propriety of the kind. The third topic concerns the assents, which is related 
<A NAME="833"></A>to the things which are persuasive and attractive. For as Socrates said, 
<A NAME="834"></A>"we ought not to live a life without examination," so we ought not to accept 
<A NAME="835"></A>an appearance without examination, but we should say, "Wait, let me see 
<A NAME="836"></A>what you are and whence you come"; like the watch at night, "Show me the 
<A NAME="837"></A>pass." "Have you the signal from nature which the appearance that may be 
<A NAME="838"></A>accepted ought to have?" And finally whatever means are applied to the 
<A NAME="839"></A>body by those who exercise it, if they tend in any way toward desire and 
<A NAME="840"></A>it, aversion, they also may be fit means of exercise; but if they are for 
<A NAME="841"></A>display, they are the indications of one who has turned himself toward 
<A NAME="842"></A>something external, and who is hunting for something else, and who looks 
<A NAME="843"></A>for spectators who will say, "Oh the great man." For this reason, Apollonius 
<A NAME="844"></A>said well, "When you intend to exercise yourself for your own advantage, 
<A NAME="845"></A>and you are thirsty from heat, take in a mouthful of cold water, and spit 
<A NAME="846"></A>it out, and tell nobody."

<A NAME="847"></A><B>Chapter 13</B>

<A NAME="848"></A><BR><BR>What solitude is, and what kind of person a solitary man 
<A NAME="849"></A>is
<A NAME="850"></A><BR><BR>Solitude is a certain condition of a helpless man. For because 
<A NAME="851"></A>a man is alone, he is not for that reason also solitary; just as though 
<A NAME="852"></A>a man is among numbers, he is not therefore not solitary. When then we 
<A NAME="853"></A>have lost either a brother, or a son, or a friend on whom we were accustomed 
<A NAME="854"></A>to repose, we say that we are left solitary, though we are often in Rome, 
<A NAME="855"></A>though such a crowd meet us, though so many live in the same place, and 
<A NAME="856"></A>sometimes we have a great number of slaves. For the man who is solitary, 
<A NAME="857"></A>as it is conceived, is considered to be a helpless person and exposed to 
<A NAME="858"></A>those who wish to harm him. For this reason when we travel, then especially 
<A NAME="859"></A>do we say that we are lonely when we fall among robbers, for it is not 
<A NAME="860"></A>the sight of a human creature which removes us from solitude, but the sight 
<A NAME="861"></A>of one who is faithful and modest and helpful to us. For if being alone 
<A NAME="862"></A>is enough to make solitude, you may say that even Zeus is solitary in the 
<A NAME="863"></A>conflagration and bewails himself saying, "Unhappy that I am who have neither 
<A NAME="864"></A>Hera, nor Athena, nor Apollo, nor brother, nor son, nor descendant nor 
<A NAME="865"></A>kinsman." This is what some say that he does when he is alone at the conflagration. 
<A NAME="866"></A>For they do not understand how a man passes his life when he is alone, 
<A NAME="867"></A>because they set out from a certain natural principle, from the natural 
<A NAME="868"></A>desire of community and mutual love and from the pleasure of conversation 
<A NAME="869"></A>among men. But none the less a man ought to be prepared in a manner for 
<A NAME="870"></A>this also, to be able to be sufficient for himself and to be his own companion. 
<A NAME="871"></A>For as Zeus dwells with himself, and is tranquil by himself, and thinks 
<A NAME="872"></A>of his own administration and of its nature, and is employed in thoughts 
<A NAME="873"></A>suitable to himself; so ought we also to be able to talk with ourselves, 
<A NAME="874"></A>not to feel the want of others also, not to be unprovided with the means 
<A NAME="875"></A>of passing our time; to observe the divine administration and the relation 
<A NAME="876"></A>of ourselves to everything else; to consider how we formerly were affected 
<A NAME="877"></A>toward things that happen and how at present; what are still the things 
<A NAME="878"></A>which give us pain; how these also can be cured and how removed; if any 
<A NAME="879"></A>things require improvement, to improve them according to 
<A NAME="880"></A>reason.
<A NAME="881"></A><BR><BR>For you see that Caesar appears to furnish us with great peace, 
<A NAME="882"></A>that there are no longer enemies nor battles nor great associations of 
<A NAME="883"></A>robbers nor of pirates, but we can travel at every hour and sail from east 
<A NAME="884"></A>to west. But can Caesar give us security from fever also, can he from shipwreck, 
<A NAME="885"></A>from fire, from earthquake or from lightning? well, I will say, can he 
<A NAME="886"></A>give us security against love? He cannot. From sorrow? He cannot. From 
<A NAME="887"></A>envy? He cannot. In a word then he cannot protect us from any of these 
<A NAME="888"></A>things. But the doctrine of philosophers promises to give us security even 
<A NAME="889"></A>against these things. And what does it say? "Men, if you will attend to 
<A NAME="890"></A>me, wherever you are, whatever you are doing, you will not feel sorrow, 
<A NAME="891"></A>nor anger, nor compulsion, nor hindrance, but you will pass your time without 
<A NAME="892"></A>perturbations and free from everything." When a man has this peace, not 
<A NAME="893"></A>proclaimed by Caesar (for how should he be able to proclaim it?), but by 
<A NAME="894"></A>God through reason, is he not content when he is alone? when he sees and 
<A NAME="895"></A>reflects, "Now no evil can happen to me; for me there is no robber, no 
<A NAME="896"></A>earthquake, everything is full of peace, full of tranquillity: every way, 
<A NAME="897"></A>every city, every meeting, neighbor, companion is harmless. One person 
<A NAME="898"></A>whose business it is, supplies me with food; another with raiment; another 
<A NAME="899"></A>with perceptions, and preconceptions. And if he does not supply what is 
<A NAME="900"></A>necessary, He gives the signal for retreat, opens the door, and says to 
<A NAME="901"></A>you, 'Go.' Go whither? To nothing terrible, but to the place from which 
<A NAME="902"></A>you came, to your friends and kinsmen, to the elements: what there was 
<A NAME="903"></A>in you of fire goes to fire; of earth, to earth; of air, to air; of water 
<A NAME="904"></A>to water: no Hades, nor Acheron, nor Cocytus, nor Pyriphlegethon, but all 
<A NAME="905"></A>is full of Gods and Demons." When a man has such things to think on, and 
<A NAME="906"></A>sees the sun, the moon and stars, and enjoys earth and sea, he is not solitary 
<A NAME="907"></A>nor even helpless. "Well then, if some man should come upon me when I am 
<A NAME="908"></A>alone and murder me?" Fool, not murder you, but your poor 
<A NAME="909"></A>body.
<A NAME="910"></A><BR><BR>What kind of solitude then remains? what want? why do we make ourselves 
<A NAME="911"></A>worse than children? and what do children do when they are left alone? 
<A NAME="912"></A>They take up shells and ashes, and they build something, then pull it down, 
<A NAME="913"></A>and build something else, and so they never want the means of passing the 
<A NAME="914"></A>time. Shall I, then, if you sail away, sit down and weep, because I have 
<A NAME="915"></A>been left alone and solitary? Shall I then have no shells, no ashes? But 
<A NAME="916"></A>children do what they do through want of thought, and we through knowledge 
<A NAME="917"></A>are unhappy.
<A NAME="918"></A><BR><BR>Every great power is dangerous to beginners. You must then bear 
<A NAME="919"></A>such things as you are able, but conformably to nature: but not... Practice 
<A NAME="920"></A>sometimes a way of living like a man in health. Abstain from food, drink 
<A NAME="921"></A>water, abstain sometimes altogether from desire, in order that you may 
<A NAME="922"></A>some time desire consistently with reason; and if consistently with reason, 
<A NAME="923"></A>when you have anything good in you, you will desire well. "Not so; but 
<A NAME="924"></A>we wish to live like wise men immediately and to be useful to men." Useful 
<A NAME="925"></A>how? what are you doing? have you been useful to yourself? "But, I suppose, 
<A NAME="926"></A>you wish to exhort them." You exhort them! You wish to be useful to them. 
<A NAME="927"></A>Show to them in your own example what kind of men philosophy makes, and 
<A NAME="928"></A>don't trifle. When you are eating, do good to those who eat with you; when 
<A NAME="929"></A>you are drinking, to those who are drinking with you; by yielding to all, 
<A NAME="930"></A>giving way, bearing with them, thus do them good, and do not spit on them 
<A NAME="931"></A>your phlegm.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="932"></A><B>Chapter 14</B>

<A NAME="933"></A><BR><BR>Certain miscellaneous matters
<A NAME="934"></A><BR><BR>As bad tragic actors cannot sing alone, but in company with many: 
<A NAME="935"></A>so some persons cannot walk about alone. Man, if you are anything, both 
<A NAME="936"></A>walk alone and talk to yourself, and do not hide yourself in the chorus. 
<A NAME="937"></A>Examine a little at last, look around, stir yourself up, that you may know 
<A NAME="938"></A>who you are.
<A NAME="939"></A><BR><BR>When a man drinks water, or does anything for the sake of practice, 
<A NAME="940"></A>whenever there is an opportunity he tells it to all: "I drink water." Is 
<A NAME="941"></A>it for this that you drink water, for the purpose of drinking water? Man, 
<A NAME="942"></A>if it is good for you to drink, drink; but if not, you are acting ridiculously. 
<A NAME="943"></A>But if it is good for you and you do drink, say nothing about it to those 
<A NAME="944"></A>who are displeased with water-drinkers. What then, do you wish to please 
<A NAME="945"></A>these very men?
<A NAME="946"></A><BR><BR>Of things that are done some are done with a final purpose, some 
<A NAME="947"></A>according to occasion, others with a certain reference to circumstances, 
<A NAME="948"></A>others for the purpose of complying with others. and some according to 
<A NAME="949"></A>a fixed scheme of life.
<A NAME="950"></A><BR><BR>You must root out of men these two things, arrogance and distrust. 
<A NAME="951"></A>Arrogance, then, is the opinion that you want nothing: but distrust is 
<A NAME="952"></A>the opinion that you cannot be happy when so many circumstances surround 
<A NAME="953"></A>you. Arrogance is removed by confutation; and Socrates was the first who 
<A NAME="954"></A>practiced this. And, that the thing is not impossible, inquire and seek. 
<A NAME="955"></A>This search will do you no harm; and in a manner this is philosophizing, 
<A NAME="956"></A>to seek how it is possible to employ desire and aversion without 
<A NAME="957"></A>impediment.
<A NAME="958"></A><BR><BR>"I am superior to you, for my father is a man of consular rank." 
<A NAME="959"></A>Another says, "I have been a tribune, but you have not." If we were horses, 
<A NAME="960"></A>would you say, "My father was swifter?" "I have much barley and fodder, 
<A NAME="961"></A>or elegant neck ornaments." If, then, while you were saying this, I said, 
<A NAME="962"></A>"Be it so: let us run then." Well, is there nothing in a man such as running 
<A NAME="963"></A>in a horse, by which it will he known which is superior and inferior? Is 
<A NAME="964"></A>there not modesty, fidelity, justice? Show yourself superior in these, 
<A NAME="965"></A>that you may be superior as a man. If you tell me that you can kick violently, 
<A NAME="966"></A>I also will say to you that you are proud of that which is the act of an 
<A NAME="967"></A>ass.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="968"></A><B>Chapter 15</B>

<A NAME="969"></A><BR><BR>That we ought to proceed with circumspection to 
<A NAME="970"></A>everything
<A NAME="971"></A><BR><BR>In every act consider what precedes and what follows, and then 
<A NAME="972"></A>proceed to the act. If you do not consider, you will at first begin with 
<A NAME="973"></A>spirit, since you have not thought at all of the things which follow; but 
<A NAME="974"></A>afterward, when some consequences have shown themselves, you will basely 
<A NAME="975"></A>desist. "I wish to conquer at the Olympic games." "And I too, by the gods: 
<A NAME="976"></A>for it is a fine thing." But consider here what precedes and what follows; 
<A NAME="977"></A>and then, if it is for your good, undertake the thing. You must act according 
<A NAME="978"></A>to rules, follow strict diet, abstain from delicacies, exercise yourself 
<A NAME="979"></A>by compulsion at fixed times, in heat, in cold; drink no cold water, nor 
<A NAME="980"></A>wine, when there is opportunity of drinking it. In a word you must surrender 
<A NAME="981"></A>yourself to the trainer as you do to a physician. Next in the contest, 
<A NAME="982"></A>you must be covered with sand, sometimes dislocate a hand, sprain an ankle, 
<A NAME="983"></A>swallow a quantity of dust, be scourged with the whip; and after undergoing 
<A NAME="984"></A>all this, you must sometimes be conquered. After reckoning all these things, 
<A NAME="985"></A>if you have still an inclination, go to the athletic practice. If you do 
<A NAME="986"></A>not reckon them, observe you behave like children who at one time you wi 
<A NAME="987"></A>play as wrestlers, then as gladiators, then blow a trumpet, then act a 
<A NAME="988"></A>tragedy, when they have seen and admired such things. So you also do: you 
<A NAME="989"></A>are at one time a wrestler, then a gladiator, then a philosopher, then 
<A NAME="990"></A>a rhetorician; but with your whole soul you are nothing: like the ape, 
<A NAME="991"></A>you imitate all that you see; and always one thing after another pleases 
<A NAME="992"></A>you, but that which becomes familiar displeases you. For you have never 
<A NAME="993"></A>undertaken anything after consideration, nor after having explored the 
<A NAME="994"></A>whole matter and put it to a strict examination; but you have undertaken 
<A NAME="995"></A>it at hazard and with a cold desire. Thus some persons having seen a philosopher 
<A NAME="996"></A>and having heard one speak like Euphrates- yet who can speak like him?- 
<A NAME="997"></A>wish to be philosophers themselves.
<A NAME="998"></A><BR><BR>Man, consider first what the matter is, then your own nature also, 
<A NAME="999"></A>what it is able to bear. If you are a wrestler, look at your shoulders, 
<A NAME="1000"></A>your thighs, your loins: for different men are naturally formed for different 
<A NAME="1001"></A>things. Do you think that, if you do, you can be a philosopher? Do you 
<A NAME="1002"></A>think that you can eat as you do now, drink as you do now, and in the same 
<A NAME="1003"></A>way be angry and out of humour? You must watch, labour, conquer certain 
<A NAME="1004"></A>desires, you must depart from your kinsmen, be despised by your slave, 
<A NAME="1005"></A>laughed at by those who meet you, in everything you must be in an inferior 
<A NAME="1006"></A>condition, as to magisterial office, in honours, in courts of justice. 
<A NAME="1007"></A>When you have considered all these things completely, then, if you think 
<A NAME="1008"></A>proper, approach to philosophy, if you would gain in exchange for these 
<A NAME="1009"></A>things freedom from perturbations, liberty, tranquillity. If you have not 
<A NAME="1010"></A>considered these things, do not approach philosophy: do not act like children, 
<A NAME="1011"></A>at one time a philosopher, then a tax collector, then a rhetorician, then 
<A NAME="1012"></A>a procurator of Caesar These things are not consistent. You must be one 
<A NAME="1013"></A>man either good or bad: you must either labour at your own ruling faculty 
<A NAME="1014"></A>or at external things: you must either labour at things within or at external 
<A NAME="1015"></A>things: that is, you must either occupy the place of a philosopher or that 
<A NAME="1016"></A>of one of the vulgar.
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR><BR>A person said to Rufus when Galba was murdered, "Is the world now 
<A NAME="1018"></A>governed by Providence?" But Rufus replied, "Did I ever incidentally form 
<A NAME="1019"></A>an argument from Galba that the world is governed by 
<A NAME="1020"></A>Providence?"
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1021"></A><B>Chapter 16</B>

<A NAME="1022"></A><BR><BR>That we ought with caution to enter, into familiar intercourse 
<A NAME="1023"></A>with men
<A NAME="1024"></A><BR><BR>If a man has frequent intercourse with others, either for talk, 
<A NAME="1025"></A>or drinking together, or generally for social purposes, he must either 
<A NAME="1026"></A>become like them, or change them to his own fashion. For if a man places 
<A NAME="1027"></A>a piece of quenched charcoal close to a piece that is burning, either the 
<A NAME="1028"></A>quenched charcoal will quench the other, or the burning charcoal will light 
<A NAME="1029"></A>that which is quenched. Since, then, the danger is so great, we must cautiously 
<A NAME="1030"></A>enter into such intimacies with those of the common sort, and remember 
<A NAME="1031"></A>that it is impossible that a man can keep company with one who is covered 
<A NAME="1032"></A>with soot without being partaker of the soot himself. For what will you 
<A NAME="1033"></A>do if a man speaks about gladiators, about horses, about athletes, or, 
<A NAME="1034"></A>what is worse, about men? "Such a person is bad," "Such a person is good": 
<A NAME="1035"></A>"This was well done," "This was done badly." Further, if he scoff, or ridicule, 
<A NAME="1036"></A>or show an ill-natured disposition? Is any man among us prepared like a 
<A NAME="1037"></A>lute-player when he takes a lute, so that as soon as he has touched the 
<A NAME="1038"></A>strings, he discovers which are discordant, and tunes the instrument? such 
<A NAME="1039"></A>a power as Socrates had who in all his social intercourse could lead his 
<A NAME="1040"></A>companions to his own purpose? How should you have this power? It is therefore 
<A NAME="1041"></A>a necessary consequence that you are carried about by the common kind of 
<A NAME="1042"></A>people.
<A NAME="1043"></A><BR><BR>Why, then, are they more powerful than you? Because they utter 
<A NAME="1044"></A>these useless words from their real opinions: but you utter your elegant 
<A NAME="1045"></A>words only from your lips; for this reason they are without strength and 
<A NAME="1046"></A>dead, and it is nauseous to listen to your exhortations and your miserable 
<A NAME="1047"></A>virtue, which is talked of everywhere. In this way the vulgar have the 
<A NAME="1048"></A>advantage over you: for every opinion is strong and invincible. Until, 
<A NAME="1049"></A>then, the good sentiments are fixed in you, and you shall have acquired 
<A NAME="1050"></A>a certain power for your security, I advise you to be careful in your association 
<A NAME="1051"></A>with like wax in the sun there will be melted away whatever you inscribe 
<A NAME="1052"></A>on your minds in the school. Withdraw, then, yourselves far from the sun 
<A NAME="1053"></A>so long as you have these waxen sentiments. For this reason also philosophers 
<A NAME="1054"></A>advise men to leave their native country, because ancient habits distract 
<A NAME="1055"></A>them and do not allow a beginning to be made of a different habit; nor 
<A NAME="1056"></A>can we tolerate those who meet us and say: "See such a one is now a philosopher, 
<A NAME="1057"></A>who was once so-and-so." Thus also physicians send those who have lingering 
<A NAME="1058"></A>diseases to a different country and a different air; and they do right, 
<A NAME="1059"></A>Do you also introduce other habits than those which you have: fix your 
<A NAME="1060"></A>opinions and exercise yourselves in them. But you do not so: you go hence 
<A NAME="1061"></A>to a spectacle, to a show of gladiators, to a place of exercise, to a circus; 
<A NAME="1062"></A>then you come back hither, and again from this place you go to those places, 
<A NAME="1063"></A>and still the same persons. And there is no pleasing habit, nor attention, 
<A NAME="1064"></A>nor care about self and observation of this kind, "How shall I use the 
<A NAME="1065"></A>appearances presented to me? according to nature, or contrary to nature? 
<A NAME="1066"></A>how do I answer to them? as I ought, or as I ought not? Do I say to those 
<A NAME="1067"></A>things which are independent of the will, that they do not concern me?" 
<A NAME="1068"></A>For if you are not yet in this state, fly from your former habits, fly 
<A NAME="1069"></A>from the common sort, if you intend ever to begin to be 
<A NAME="1070"></A>something.

<A NAME="1072"></A><BR><BR>On providence
<A NAME="1073"></A><BR><BR>When you make any charge against Providence, consider, and you 
<A NAME="1074"></A>will learn that the thing has happened according to reason. "Yes, but the 
<A NAME="1075"></A>unjust man has the advantage." In what? "In money." Yes, for he is superior 
<A NAME="1076"></A>to you in this, that he flatters, is free from shame, and is watchful. 
<A NAME="1077"></A>What is the wonder? But see if he has the advantage over you in being faithful, 
<A NAME="1078"></A>in being modest: for you will not find it to be so; but wherein you are 
<A NAME="1079"></A>superior, there you will find that you have the advantage. And I once said 
<A NAME="1080"></A>to a man who was vexed because Philostorgus was fortunate: "Would you choose 
<A NAME="1081"></A>to lie with Sura?" "May it never happen," he replied, "that this day should 
<A NAME="1082"></A>come?" "Why then are you vexed, if he receives something in return for 
<A NAME="1083"></A>that which he sells; or how can you consider him happy who acquires those 
<A NAME="1084"></A>things by such means as you abominate; or what wrong does Providence, if 
<A NAME="1085"></A>he gives the better things to the better men? Is it not better to be modest 
<A NAME="1086"></A>than to be rich?" He admitted this. Why are you vexed then, man, when you 
<A NAME="1087"></A>possess the better thing? Remember, then, always, and have in readiness, 
<A NAME="1088"></A>the truth that this is a law of nature, that the superior has an advantage 
<A NAME="1089"></A>over the inferior in that in which he is superior; and you will never be 
<A NAME="1090"></A>vexed.
<A NAME="1091"></A><BR><BR>"But my wife treats me badly." Well, if any man asks you what this 
<A NAME="1092"></A>is, say, "My wife treats me badly." "Is there, then, nothing more?" Nothing. 
<A NAME="1093"></A>"My father gives me nothing." But to say that this is an evil is something 
<A NAME="1094"></A>which must be added to it externally, and falsely added. For this reason 
<A NAME="1095"></A>we must not get rid of poverty, but of the opinion about poverty, and then 
<A NAME="1096"></A>we shall be happy.

<A NAME="1098"></A><BR><BR>That we ought not to be disturbed by any news
<A NAME="1099"></A><BR><BR>When anything shall be reported to you which is of a nature to 
<A NAME="1100"></A>disturb, have this principle in readiness, that the news is about nothing 
<A NAME="1101"></A>which is within the power
