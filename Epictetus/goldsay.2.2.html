<A NAME="10"></A><B>LXXXIV</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>When disease and death overtake me, I would fain be found engaged in the 
<A NAME="12"></A>task of liberating mine oew Will from the assaults of passion, from hindrance, 
<A NAME="13"></A>from resentment, from slavery.
<A NAME="14"></A><BR><BR>Thus would I fain to be found employed, so that I may say to God, 
<A NAME="15"></A>"Have I in aught transgressed Thy commands? Have I in aught perverted the 
<A NAME="16"></A>faculties, the senses, the natural principles that Thou didst give me? 
<A NAME="17"></A>Have I ever blamed Thee or found fault with Thine administration? When 
<A NAME="18"></A>it was Thy good pleasure, I fell sick-- and so did other men: by my will 
<A NAME="19"></A>consented. Because it was Thy pleasure, I became poor: but my heart rejoiced. 
<A NAME="20"></A>No power in the State was mine, because Thou wouldst not: such power I 
<A NAME="21"></A>never desired! Hast Thou ever seen me of more doleful countenance on that 
<A NAME="22"></A>account? Have I not ever drawn nigh unto Thee with cheerful look, waiting 
<A NAME="23"></A>upon Thy commands, attentive to Thy signals? Wilt Thou that I now depart 
<A NAME="24"></A>from the great Assembly of men? I go: I give Thee all thanks, that Thou 
<A NAME="25"></A>hast deemed me worthy to take part with Thee in this Assembly: to behold 
<A NAME="26"></A>Thy works, to comprehend this Thine administration."
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR>Such I would were the subject of my thoughts, my pen, my study, 
<A NAME="28"></A>when death overtakes me.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="29"></A><B>LXXXV</B>

<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>Seemeth it nothing to you, never to accuse, never to blame either 
<A NAME="31"></A>God or Man? to wear ever the same countenance in going forth as in coming 
<A NAME="32"></A>in? This was the secret of Socrates: yet he never said that he knew or 
<A NAME="33"></A>taught anything. . . . Who amongst you makes this his aim? Were it indeed 
<A NAME="34"></A>so, you would gladly endure sickness, hunger, aye, death 
<A NAME="35"></A>itself.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="36"></A><B>LXXXVI</B>

<A NAME="37"></A><BR><BR>How are we constituted by Nature? To be free, to be noble, to be 
<A NAME="38"></A>modest (for what other living thing is capable of blushing, or of feeling 
<A NAME="39"></A>the impression of shame?) and to subordinate pleasure to the ends for which 
<A NAME="40"></A>Nature designed us, as a handmaid and a minister, in order to call forth 
<A NAME="41"></A>our activity; in order to keep us constant to the path prescribed by 
<A NAME="42"></A>Nature.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="43"></A><B>LXXXVII</B>

<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR>The husbandman deals with land; physicians and trainers with the 
<A NAME="45"></A>body; the wise man with his own Mind.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="46"></A><B>LXXXVIII</B>

<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR>Which of us does not admire what Lycurgus the Spartan did? A young 
<A NAME="48"></A>citizen had put out his eye, and been handed over to him by the people 
<A NAME="49"></A>to be punished at his own discretion. Lycurgus abstained from all vengeance, 
<A NAME="50"></A>but on the contrary instructed and made a good man of him. Producing him 
<A NAME="51"></A>in public in the theatre, he said to the astonished Spartans:--"I received 
<A NAME="52"></A>this young man at your hands full of violence and wanton insolence; I restore 
<A NAME="53"></A>him to you in his right mind and fit to serve his country."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="54"></A><B>LXXXIX</B>

<A NAME="55"></A><BR><BR>A money-changer may not reject Caesar's coin, nor may the seller 
<A NAME="56"></A>of herbs, but must when once the coin is shown, deliver what is sold for 
<A NAME="57"></A>it, whether he will or no. So is it also with the Soul. Once the Good appears, 
<A NAME="58"></A>it attracts towards itself; evil repels. But a clear and certain impression 
<A NAME="59"></A>of the Good the Soul will never reject, any more than men do Caesar's coin. 
<A NAME="60"></A>On this hangs every impulse alike of Man and God.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="61"></A><B>XC</B>

<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR>Asked what Common Sense was, Epictetus replied:--
<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR>As that may be called a Common Ear which distinguishes only sounds, 
<A NAME="64"></A>while that which distinguishes musical notes is not common but produced 
<A NAME="65"></A>by training; so there are certain things which men not entirely perverted 
<A NAME="66"></A>see by the natural principles common to all. Such a constitution of the 
<A NAME="67"></A>Mind is called Common Sense.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="68"></A><B>XCI</B>

<A NAME="69"></A><BR><BR>Canst thou judge men? . . . then make us imitators of thyself, 
<A NAME="70"></A>as Socrates did. Do this, do not do that, else will I cast thee into prision; 
<A NAME="71"></A>this is not governing men like reasonable creatures. Say rather, As God 
<A NAME="72"></A>hath ordained, so do; else thou wilt suffer chastisement and loss. Askest 
<A NAME="73"></A>thou what loss? None other than this: To have left undone what thou shouldst 
<A NAME="74"></A>have done: to have lost the faithfulness, the reverence, the modesty that 
<A NAME="75"></A>is in thee! Greater loss than this seek not to find!
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="76"></A><B>XCII</B>

<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>"His son is dead."
<A NAME="78"></A><BR><BR>What has happened?
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>"His son is dead."
<A NAME="80"></A><BR><BR>Nothing more?
<A NAME="81"></A><BR><BR>"Nothing."
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR>"His ship is lost."
<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR>"He has been haled to prision."
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><BR>What has happened?
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>"He has been haled to prision."
<A NAME="86"></A><BR><BR>But that any of these things are misfortunes to him, is an addition 
<A NAME="87"></A>which every one makes of his own. But (you say) God is unjust is this.--Why? 
<A NAME="88"></A>For having given thee endurance and greatness of soul? For having made 
<A NAME="89"></A>such things to be no evils? For placing happiness within thy reach, even 
<A NAME="90"></A>when enduring them? For open unto thee a door, when things make not for 
<A NAME="91"></A>thy good?-- Depart, my friend and find fault no more!
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="92"></A><B>XCIII</B>

<A NAME="93"></A><BR><BR>You are sailing to Rome (you tell me) to obtain the post of Governor 
<A NAME="94"></A>of Cnossus. You are not content to stay at home with the honours you had 
<A NAME="95"></A>before; you want something on a larger scale, and more conspicuous. But 
<A NAME="96"></A>when did you ever undertake a voyage for the purpose of reviewing your 
<A NAME="97"></A>own principles and getting rid of any of them that proved unsound? Whom 
<A NAME="98"></A>did you ever visit for that object? What time did you ever set yourself 
<A NAME="99"></A>for that? What age? Run over the times of your life--by yourself, if you 
<A NAME="100"></A>are ashamed before me. Did you examine your principles when a boy? Did 
<A NAME="101"></A>you not do everything just as you do now? Or when you were a stripling, 
<A NAME="102"></A>attending the school of oratory and practising the art yourself, what did 
<A NAME="103"></A>you ever imagine you lacked? And when you were a young man, entered upon 
<A NAME="104"></A>public life, and were pleading causes and making a name, who any longer 
<A NAME="105"></A>seemed equal to you? And at what moment would you have endured another 
<A NAME="106"></A>examining your principles and proving that they were unsound? What then 
<A NAME="107"></A>am I to say to you? "Help me in this matter!" you cry. Ah, for that I have 
<A NAME="108"></A>no rule! And neither did you, if that was your object, come to me as a 
<A NAME="109"></A>philosopher, but as you might have gone to a herb-seller or a cobbler.--"What 
<A NAME="110"></A>do philosophers have rules for, then?"--Why, that whatever may betide, 
<A NAME="111"></A>our ruling faculty may be as Nature would have it, and so remain. Think 
<A NAME="112"></A>you this a small matter? Not so! but the greatest thing there is. Well, 
<A NAME="113"></A>does it need but a short time? Can it be grasped by a passer-by?--grasp 
<A NAME="114"></A>it, if you can!
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR>Then you will say, "Yes, I met Epictetus!"
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR>Aye, just as you might a statue or a monument. You saw me! and 
<A NAME="117"></A>that is all. But a man who meets a man is one who learns the other's mind, 
<A NAME="118"></A>and lets him see is in turn. Learn my mind--show me yours; and then go 
<A NAME="119"></A>and say that you met me. Let us try each other; if I have any wrong principle, 
<A NAME="120"></A>rid me of it; if you have, out with it. That is what meeting a philosopher 
<A NAME="121"></A>means. Not so, you think; this is only a flying visit; while we are hiring 
<A NAME="122"></A>the ship, we can see Epictetus too! Let us see what he has to say. Then 
<A NAME="123"></A>on leaving you cry, "Out on Epictetus for a worthless fellow, provincial 
<A NAME="124"></A>and barbarous of speech!" What else indeed did you come to judge 
<A NAME="125"></A>of?
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="126"></A><B>XCIV</B>

<A NAME="127"></A><BR><BR>Whether you will or no, you are poorer than 
<A NAME="128"></A>I!
<A NAME="129"></A><BR><BR>"What then do I lack?"
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR>What you have not: Constancy of mind, such as Nature would have 
<A NAME="131"></A>it be: Tranquillity. Patron or no patron, what care I? but you do care. 
<A NAME="132"></A>I am richer than you: I am not racked with anxiety as to what Caesar may 
<A NAME="133"></A>think of me; I flatter none on that account. This is what I have, instead 
<A NAME="134"></A>of vessels of gold and silver! your vessels may be of gold, but your reason, 
<A NAME="135"></A>your principles, your accepted views, your inclinations, your desires are 
<A NAME="136"></A>of earthenware.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="137"></A><B>XCV</B>

<A NAME="138"></A><BR><BR>To you, all you have seems small: to me, all I have seems great. 
<A NAME="139"></A>Your desire is insatiable, mine is satisfied. See children thrusting their 
<A NAME="140"></A>hands into a narrow-necked jar, and striving to pull out the nuts and figs 
<A NAME="141"></A>it contains: if they fill the hand, they cannot pull it out again, and 
<A NAME="142"></A>then they fall to tears.-- "Let go a few of them, and then you can draw 
<A NAME="143"></A>out the rest!"-- You, too, let your desire go! covet not many things, and 
<A NAME="144"></A>you will obtain.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="145"></A><B>XCVI</B>

<A NAME="146"></A><BR><BR>Pittacus wronged by one whom he had it in his power to punish, 
<A NAME="147"></A>let him go free, saying, Forgiveness is better than revenge. The one shows 
<A NAME="148"></A>native gentleness, the other savagery.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="149"></A><B>XCVII</B>

<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR>"My brother ought not to have treated me thus."
<A NAME="151"></A><BR><BR>True: but he must see to that. However he may treat me, I must 
<A NAME="152"></A>deal rightly by him. This is what lies with me, what none can 
<A NAME="153"></A>hinder.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="154"></A><B>XCVIII</B>

<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR>Nevertheless a man should also be prepared to be sufficient unto 
<A NAME="156"></A>himself--to dwell with himself alone, even as God dwells with Himself alone, 
<A NAME="157"></A>shares His repose with none, and considers the nature of His own administration, 
<A NAME="158"></A>intent upon such thoughts as are meet unto Himself. So should we also be 
<A NAME="159"></A>able to converse with ourselves, to need none else beside, to sigh for 
<A NAME="160"></A>no distraction, to bend our thoughts upon the Divine Administration, and 
<A NAME="161"></A>how we stand related to all else; to observe how human accidents touched 
<A NAME="162"></A>us of old, and how they touch us now; what things they are that still have 
<A NAME="163"></A>power to hurt us, and how they may be cured or removed; to perfect what 
<A NAME="164"></A>needs perfecting as Reason would direct.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="165"></A><B>XCIX</B>

<A NAME="166"></A><BR><BR>If a man has frequent intercourse with others, either in the way 
<A NAME="167"></A>of conversation, entertainment, or simple familiarity, he must either become 
<A NAME="168"></A>like them, or change them to his own fashion. A live coal placed next a 
<A NAME="169"></A>dead one will either kindle that or be quenched by it. Such being the risk, 
<A NAME="170"></A>it is well to be cautious in admitting intimacies of this sort, remembering 
<A NAME="171"></A>that one cannot rub shoulders with a soot-stained man without sharing the 
<A NAME="172"></A>soot oneself. What will you do, supposing the talk turns on gladiators, 
<A NAME="173"></A>or horses, or prize-fighters, or (what is worse) on persons, condemning 
<A NAME="174"></A>this and that, approving the other? Or suppose a man sneers and jeers or 
<A NAME="175"></A>shows a malignant temper? Has any among us the skill of the lute-player, 
<A NAME="176"></A>who knows at the first touch which strings are out of tune and sets the 
<A NAME="177"></A>instrument right: has any of you such power as Socrates had, in all his 
<A NAME="178"></A>intercourse with men, of winning them over to his own convictions? Nay, 
<A NAME="179"></A>but you must needs be swayed hither and thither by the uninstructed. How 
<A NAME="180"></A>comes it then that they prove so much stronger than you? Because they speak 
<A NAME="181"></A>from the fulness of the heart--their low, corrupt views are their real 
<A NAME="182"></A>convictions: whereas your fine sentiments are but from the lips, outwards; 
<A NAME="183"></A>that is why they are so nerveless and dead. It turns one's stomach to listen 
<A NAME="184"></A>to your exhortations, and hear of your miserable Virtue, that you prate 
<A NAME="185"></A>of up and down. Thus it is that the Vulgar prove too strong for you. Everywhere 
<A NAME="186"></A>strength, everywhere victory waits your conviction!
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="187"></A><B>C</B>

<A NAME="188"></A><BR><BR>In general, any methods of discipline applied to the body which 
<A NAME="189"></A>tend to modify its desires or repulsions, are good--for ascetic ends. But 
<A NAME="190"></A>if done for display, they betray at once a man who keeps an eye on outward 
<A NAME="191"></A>show; who has an ulterior purpose, and is looking for spectators to shout, 
<A NAME="192"></A>"Oh what a great man!" This is why Apollonius so well said: "If you are 
<A NAME="193"></A>bent upon a little private discipline, wait till you are choking with heat 
<A NAME="194"></A>some day--then take a mouthful of cold water, and spit it out again, and 
<A NAME="195"></A>tell no man!"
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="196"></A><B>CI</B>

<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>Study how to give as one that is sick: that thou mayest hereafter 
<A NAME="198"></A>give as one that is whole. Fast; drink water only; abstain altogether from 
<A NAME="199"></A>desire, that thou mayest hereafter conform thy desire to 
<A NAME="200"></A>Reason.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="201"></A><B>CII</B>

<A NAME="202"></A><BR><BR>Thou wouldst do good unto men? then show them by thine own example 
<A NAME="203"></A>what kind of men philosophy can make, and cease from foolish trifling. 
<A NAME="204"></A>Eating, do good to them that eat with thee; drinking, to them that drink 
<A NAME="205"></A>with thee; yield unto all, give way, and bear with them. Thus shalt thou 
<A NAME="206"></A>do them good: but vent not upon them thine own evil 
<A NAME="207"></A>humour!
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="208"></A><B>CIII</B>

<A NAME="209"></A><BR><BR>Even as bad actors cannot sing alone, but only in chorus: so some 
<A NAME="210"></A>cannot walk alone.
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR>Man, if thou art aught, strive to walk alone and hold converse 
<A NAME="212"></A>with thyself, instead of skulking in the chorus! at length think; look 
<A NAME="213"></A>aroung thee; bestir thyself, that thou mayest know who thou 
<A NAME="214"></A>art!
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="215"></A><B>CIV</B>

<A NAME="216"></A><BR><BR>You would fain be victor at the Olympic games, you say. Yes, but 
<A NAME="217"></A>weigh the conditions, weigh the consequences; then and then only, lay to 
<A NAME="218"></A>your hand--if it be for your profit. You must live by rule, submit to diet, 
<A NAME="219"></A>abstain from dainty meats, exercise your body perforce at stated hours, 
<A NAME="220"></A>in heat or in cold; drink no cold water, nor, it may be, wine. In a word, 
<A NAME="221"></A>you must surrender yourself wholly to your trainer, as though to a 
<A NAME="222"></A>physician.
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR>Then in the hour of contest, you will have to delve the ground, 
<A NAME="224"></A>it may chance dislocate an arm, sprain an ankle, gulp down abundance of 
<A NAME="225"></A>yellow sand, be scourge with the whip--and with all this sometimes lose 
<A NAME="226"></A>the victory. Count the cost--and then, if your desire still holds, try 
<A NAME="227"></A>the wrestler's life. Else let me tell you that you will be behaving like 
<A NAME="228"></A>a pack of children playing now at wrestlers, now at gladiators; presently 
<A NAME="229"></A>falling to trumpeting and anon to stageplaying, when the fancy takes them 
<A NAME="230"></A>for what they have seen. And you are even the same: wrestler, gladiator, 
<A NAME="231"></A>philosopher, orator all by turns and none of them with your whole soul. 
<A NAME="232"></A>Like an ape, you mimic what you see, to one thing constant never; the thing 
<A NAME="233"></A>that is familiar charms no more. This is because you never undertook aught 
<A NAME="234"></A>with due consideration, nor after strictly testing and viewing it from 
<A NAME="235"></A>every side; no, your choice was thoughtless; the glow of your desire had 
<A NAME="236"></A>waxed cold . . . .
<A NAME="237"></A><BR><BR>Friend, bethink you first what it is you would do, and then what 
<A NAME="238"></A>your own nature is able to bear. Would you be a wrestler, consider your 
<A NAME="239"></A>shoulders, your thighs, your lions--not all men are formed to the same

<A NAME="284"></A>this post; even as He counselled Socrates to fill the post of one who confutes 
<A NAME="285"></A>error, assigning to Diogenes the royal office of high reproof, and to Zeno

<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR>When a friend inclined to Cynic views asked Epictetus, what sort 
<A NAME="298"></A>of person a true Cynic should be, requesting a general sketch of the system, 
<A NAME="299"></A>he answered:--"We will consider that at leisure. At present I content myself 
<A NAME="300"></A>with saying this much: If a man put his hand to so weighty a matter without 
<A NAME="301"></A>God, the wrath of God abides upon him. That which he covets will but bring 
<A NAME="302"></A>upon him public shame. Not even on finding himself in a well-ordered house 
<A NAME="303"></A>does a man step forward and say to himself, I must be master here! Else 
<A NAME="304"></A>the lord of that house takes notice of it, and, seeing him insolently giving 
<A NAME="305"></A>orders, drags him forth and chastises him. So it is also in this great 
<A NAME="306"></A>City, the World. Here also is there a Lord of the House, who orders all 
<A NAME="307"></A>thing:--
<A NAME="308"></A><BR><BR>"Thou are the Sun! in thine orbit thou hast power to make the year 
<A NAME="309"></A>and the seasons;
<A NAME="310"></A><BR><BR>to bid the fruits of the earth to grow and increase, the winds 
<A NAME="311"></A>arise and fall; thou canst in due measure cherish with thy warmth the frames 
<A NAME="312"></A>of men; go make thy circuit, and thus minister unto all from the greatest 
<A NAME="313"></A>to the least! . . .
<A NAME="314"></A><BR><BR>"Thou canst lead a host against Troy; be Agamemnon!" "Thou canst 
<A NAME="315"></A>meet Hector in single combat; be Achilles!"
<A NAME="316"></A><BR><BR>But had Thersites stepped forward and claimed the chief command, 
<A NAME="317"></A>he had been met with a refusal, or obtained it only to his own shame and 
<A NAME="318"></A>confusion of face, before a cloud of witnesses."

<A NAME="320"></A><BR><BR>Others may fence themselves with walls and houses, when they do 
<A NAME="321"></A>such deeds as these, and wrap themselves in darkness--aye, they have many 
<A NAME="322"></A>a device to hide themselves. Another may shut his door and station one 
<A NAME="323"></A>before his chamber to say, if any comes, He has gone forth! he is not at 
<A NAME="324"></A>leisure! But the true Cynic will have none of these things; instead of 
<A NAME="325"></A>them, he must wrap himself in Modesty: else he will but bring himself to 
<A NAME="326"></A>shame, naked and under the open sky. That is his house; that is his door; 
<A NAME="327"></A>that is the slave that guards his chamber; that is his

<A NAME="330"></A><BR><BR>Death? let it come when it will, whether it smite but a part of

<A NAME="332"></A>cast me beyond the limits of the World? It may not be! And whithersoever 
<A NAME="333"></A>I go, there shall I still find Sun, Moon, and Stars; there I shall find

<A NAME="336"></A><BR><BR>Furthermore the true Cynic must know that he is sent as a Messenger 
<A NAME="337"></A>from God to men, to show unto them that as touching good and evil they 
<A NAME="338"></A>are in error; looking for these where they are not to be found, nor ever 
<A NAME="339"></A>bethinking themselves where they are. And like Diogenes when brought before 
<A NAME="340"></A>Philip after the battle of Chaeronea, the Cynic must remember that he is 
<A NAME="341"></A>a Spy. For a Spy he really is--to bring back word what things are on Man's 
<A NAME="342"></A>side, and what against him. And when he had diligently observed all, he 
<A NAME="343"></A>must come back with a true report, not terrified into announcing them to 
<A NAME="344"></A>be foes that are no foes, nor otherwise perturbed or confounded by the

<A NAME="350"></A>that it may be so. Behold me! I have neither house nor possessions nor 
<A NAME="351"></A>servants: the ground is my couch; I have no wife, no children, no shelter--nothing 
<A NAME="352"></A>but earth and sky, and one poor cloak. And what lack I yet? am I not untouched 
<A NAME="353"></A>by sorrow, by fear? am I not free? . . . when have I laid anything to the 
<A NAME="354"></A>charge of God or Man? when have I accussed any? hath any of you seen me 
<A NAME="355"></A>with a sorrowful countenance? And in what wise treat I those of whom you 
<A NAME="356"></A>stand in fear and awe? Is it not as slaves? Who when he seeth me doth not

<A NAME="359"></A><BR><BR>Give thyself more diligently to reflection: know thyself: take

<A NAME="363"></A><BR><BR>"But to marry and to rear offspring," said the young man, "will 
<A NAME="364"></A>the Cynic hold himself bound to undertake this as a chief 
<A NAME="365"></A>duty?"
<A NAME="366"></A><BR><BR>Grant me a republic of wise men, answered Epictetus, and perhaps 
<A NAME="367"></A>none will lightly take the Cynic life upon him. For on whose account should 
<A NAME="368"></A>he embrace that method of life? Suppose however that he does, there will 
<A NAME="369"></A>then be nothing to hinder his marrying and rearing offspring. For his wife 
<A NAME="370"></A>will be even such another as himself, and likewise her father; and in like 
<A NAME="371"></A>manner will his children be brought up.
<A NAME="372"></A><BR><BR>But in the present condition of things, which resembles an Army 
<A NAME="373"></A>in battle array, ought not the Cynic to be free from all distraction and 
<A NAME="374"></A>given wholly to the service of God, so that he can go in and out among 
<A NAME="375"></A>men, neither fettered by the duties nor entangled by the relations of common 
<A NAME="376"></A>life? For if he transgress them, he will forfeit the character of a good 
<A NAME="377"></A>man and true; whereas if he observe them, there is an end to him as the

<A NAME="383"></A>and talk about revenue and supplies, when his business is to converse with 
<A NAME="384"></A>all men, Athenians, Corinthians, and Romans alike, not about supplies, 
<A NAME="385"></A>not about revenue, nor yet peace and war, but about Happiness and Misery, 
<A NAME="386"></A>Prosperity and Adversity, Slavery and Freedom?
<A NAME="387"></A><BR><BR>Ask you whether a man shall engage in the administration of the 
<A NAME="388"></A>State who has engaged in such an Administration as this? Ask me too if 
<A NAME="389"></A>he shall govern; and again I will answer, Fool, what greater government

<A NAME="391"></A><B>CXVIII</B>

<A NAME="392"></A><BR><BR>Such a man needs also to have a certain habit of body. If he appears 
<A NAME="393"></A>consumptive, thin and pale, his testimony has no longer the same authority. 
<A NAME="394"></A>He must not only prove to the unlearned by showing them what his Soul is 
<A NAME="395"></A>that it is possible to be a good man apart from all that they admire; but 
<A NAME="396"></A>he must also show them, by his body, that a plain and simple manner of 
<A NAME="397"></A>life under the open sky does no harm to the body either. "See, I am proof 
<A NAME="398"></A>of this! and my body also." As Diogenes used to do, who went about fresh 
<A NAME="399"></A>of look and by the very appearance of his body drew men's eyes. But if 
<A NAME="400"></A>a Cynic is an object of pity, he seems a mere beggar; all turn away, all 
<A NAME="401"></A>are offended at him. Nor should he be slovenly of look, so as not to scare 
<A NAME="402"></A>men from him in this way either; on the contrary, his very roughness should

<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR>Kings and tyrants have armed guards wherewith to chastise certain

<A NAME="407"></A>this power--not arms and guards. When he knows that he has watched and 
<A NAME="408"></A>laboured on behalf of mankind: that sleep hath found him pure, and left 
<A NAME="409"></A>him purer still: that his thoughts have been the thought of a Friend of 
<A NAME="410"></A>the Gods--of a servant, yet one that hath a part in the government of the 
<A NAME="411"></A>Supreme God: that the words are ever on his lips:--

<A NAME="434"></A>with neither shoulder, nor head, nor issue, nor abscess a whit the better

<A NAME="456"></A>believing Him so to be, and in all that he did had ever his eyes fixed

<A NAME="463"></A>of executing you Commander's orders, complain if aught harsher than usual 
<A NAME="464"></A>is enjoined; not understanding to what condition you are bringing the army, 
<A NAME="465"></A>so far as in you lies. If all were to follow your example, none would dig

<A NAME="535"></A>him, I will depart, not in disobedience to Thee, but as though Thou wert 
<A NAME="536"></A>sounding the signal for my retreat: I am not deserting Thee--far be that 
<A NAME="537"></A>from me! I only perceive that thou needest me no longer.

<A NAME="539"></A><BR><BR>If you are in Gyaros, do not let your mind dwell upon life at Rome, 
<A NAME="540"></A>and all the pleasures it offered to you when living there, and all that 
<A NAME="541"></A>would attend your return. Rather be intent on this--how he that lives in 
<A NAME="542"></A>Gyaros may live in Gyaros like a man of spirit. And if you are at Rome, 
<A NAME="543"></A>do not let your mind dwell upon the life at Athens, but study only how 
<A NAME="544"></A>to live at Rome.
<A NAME="545"></A><BR><BR>Finally, in the room of all other pleasures put this--the pleasure 
<A NAME="546"></A>which springs from concious obedience to God.

<A NAME="547"></A><B>CXXXIV</B>

<A NAME="548"></A><BR><BR>To a good man there is no evil, either in life or death. And if 
<A NAME="549"></A>God supply not food, has He not, as a wise Commander, sounded the signal 
<A NAME="550"></A>for retreat and nothing more? I obey, I follow-- speaking good of my Commander, 
<A NAME="551"></A>and praising His acts. For at His good pleasure I came; and I depart when 
<A NAME="552"></A>it pleases Him; and while I was yet alive that was my work, to sing praises 
<A NAME="553"></A>unto God!
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="554"></A><B>CXXXV</B>

<A NAME="555"></A><BR><BR>Reflect that the chief source of all evils to Man, and of baseness 
<A NAME="556"></A>and cowardice, is not death, but the fear of death.
<A NAME="557"></A><BR><BR>Against this fear then, I pray you, harden yourself; to this let 
<A NAME="558"></A>all your reasonings, your exercises, your reading tend. Then shall you 
<A NAME="559"></A>know that thus alone are men set free.

<A NAME="561"></A><BR><BR>He is free who lives as he wishes to live; to whom none can do 
<A NAME="562"></A>violence, none hinder or compel; whose impulses are unimpeded, whose desires 
<A NAME="563"></A>are attain their purpose, who falls not into what he would avoid. Whe then 
<A NAME="564"></A>would live in error?--None. Who would live deceived and prone to fall, 
<A NAME="565"></A>unjust, intemperate, in abject whining at his lot?--None. Then doth no 
<A NAME="566"></A>wicked man live as he would, and therefore neither is he 
<A NAME="567"></A>free.

<A NAME="568"></A><B>CXXXVII</B>

<A NAME="569"></A><BR><BR>Thus do the more cautious of travellers act. The road is said to 
<A NAME="570"></A>be beset by robbers. The traveller will not venture alone, but awaits the 
<A NAME="571"></A>companionship on the road of an ambassador, a quaestor or a proconsul. 
<A NAME="572"></A>To him he attaches himself and thus passes by in safety. So doth the wise 
<A NAME="573"></A>man in the world. Many are the companies of robbers and tyrants, many the 
<A NAME="574"></A>storms, the straits, the losses of all a man holds dearest. Whither shall 
<A NAME="575"></A>he fall for refuge--how shall he pass by unassailed? What companion on 
<A NAME="576"></A>the road shall he await for protection? Such and such a wealthy man, of 
<A NAME="577"></A>consular rank? And how shall I be profited, if he is stripped and falls 
<A NAME="578"></A>to lamentation and weeping? And how if my fellow-traveller himself turns 
<A NAME="579"></A>upon me and robs me? What am I to do? I will become a friend of Caesar's! 
<A NAME="580"></A>in his train none will do me wrong! In the first place--O the indignities 
<A NAME="581"></A>I must endure to win distinction! O the multitude of hands there will be 
<A NAME="582"></A>to rob me! And if I succeed, Caesar too is but a mortal. While should it 
<A NAME="583"></A>come to pass that I offend him, whither shall I flee from his presence? 
<A NAME="584"></A>To the wilderness? And may not fever await me there? What then is to be 
<A NAME="585"></A>done? Cannot a fellow-traveller be found that is honest and loyal, stong 
<A NAME="586"></A>and secure against surprise? Thus doth the wise man reason, considering 
<A NAME="587"></A>that if he would pass through in safety, he must attach himself unto 
<A NAME="588"></A>God.

<A NAME="589"></A><B>CXXXVIII</B>

<A NAME="590"></A><BR><BR>"How understandest thou attach himself to God?"
<A NAME="591"></A><BR><BR>That what God wills, he should will also; that what God wills not, 
<A NAME="592"></A>neither should he will.
<A NAME="593"></A><BR><BR>"How then may this come to pass?"
<A NAME="594"></A><BR><BR>By considering the movements of God, and His 
<A NAME="595"></A>administration.

<A NAME="599"></A>and to what end comest thou here? was it not He that made the Light manifest 
<A NAME="600"></A>unto thee, that gave thee fellow-workers, and senses, and the power to 
<A NAME="601"></A>reason? And how brought He thee into the world? Was it not as one born 
<A NAME="602"></A>to die; as one bound to live out his earthly life in some small tabernacle 
<A NAME="603"></A>of flesh; to behold His administration, and for a little while share with 
<A NAME="604"></A>Him in the mighty march of this great Festival Procession? Now therefore 
<A NAME="605"></A>that thou hast beheld, while it was permitted thee, the Solemn Feast and 
<A NAME="606"></A>Assembly, wilt thou not cheerfully depart, whem He summons thee forth, 
<A NAME="607"></A>with adoration and thanksgiving for what thou hast seen and heard?--"Nay, 
<A NAME="608"></A>but I would fain have stayed longer at the Festival."--Ah, so would the 
<A NAME="609"></A>mystics fain have the rites prolonged; so perchance would the crowd at 
<A NAME="610"></A>the Great Games fain behold more wrestlers still. But the Solemn Assembly 
<A NAME="611"></A>is over! Come forth, depart with thanksgiving and modesty--give place to 
<A NAME="612"></A>others that must come into being even as thyself.

<A NAME="614"></A><BR><BR>Why art thou thus insatiable? why thus unreasonable? why encumber 
<A NAME="615"></A>the world?--"Aye, but I fain would have my wife and children with me too."--What, 
<A NAME="616"></A>are they then thine, and not His that gave them--His that made thee? Give 
<A NAME="617"></A>up then that which is not thine own: yield it to One who is better than 
<A NAME="618"></A>thou. "Nay, but why did He bring one into the world on these conditions?"--If 
<A NAME="619"></A>it suits thee not, depart! He hath no need of a spectator who finds fault 
<A NAME="620"></A>with his lot! Them that will take part in the Feast he needeth--that will 
<A NAME="621"></A>lift their voices with the restm that men may applaud the more, and exalt 
<A NAME="622"></A>the Great Assembly in hymns and songs of praise. But the wretched and the 
<A NAME="623"></A>fearful He will not be displeased to see absent from it: for when they 
<A NAME="624"></A>were present, they did not behave as at a Feast, nor fulfil their proper 
<A NAME="625"></A>office; but moaned as though in pain, and found fault with their fate, 
<A NAME="626"></A>their fortune and their companions; insensible to what had fallen to their 
<A NAME="627"></A>lot, insensible to the powers they had received for a very different purpose--the 
<A NAME="628"></A>powers of Magnanimity, Nobility of Heart, of Fortitude, or 
<A NAME="629"></A>Freedom!
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="630"></A><B>CXLI</B>

<A NAME="631"></A><BR><BR>Art thou then free? a man may say. So help me heaven, I long and 
<A NAME="632"></A>pray for freedom! But I cannot look my masters boldly in the face; I still 
<A NAME="633"></A>value the poor body; I still set much store on its preservation whole and 
<A NAME="634"></A>sound.
<A NAME="635"></A><BR><BR>But I can point thee out a free man, that thou mayest be no more 
<A NAME="636"></A>in search of an example. Diogenes was free. How so? Not because he was 
<A NAME="637"></A>of free parentage (for that, indeed, was not the case), but because he 
<A NAME="638"></A>was himself free. He had cast away every handle whereby slavery might lay 
<A NAME="639"></A>hold of him to enslave him, nor was it possible for any to approach and 
<A NAME="640"></A>take hold of him to enslave him. All things sat loose upon him--all things 
<A NAME="641"></A>were to him attached by but slender ties. Hadst thou siezed upon his possessions, 
<A NAME="642"></A>he would rather have let them go than have followed thee for them--aye, 
<A NAME="643"></A>had it been even a limb, or mayhap his whole body; and in like manner, 
<A NAME="644"></A>relatives, friends, and country. For he knew whence they came--from whose 
<A NAME="645"></A>hands and on what terms he had received them. His true forefathers, the 
<A NAME="646"></A>Gods, his true Country, he never would have abandoned; nor would he have 
<A NAME="647"></A>yielded to any man in obedience and submission to the one nor in cheerfully 
<A NAME="648"></A>dying for the other. For he was ever mindful that everything that comes 
<A NAME="649"></A>to pass has its source and origin there; being indeed brought about for 
<A NAME="650"></A>the weal of that his true Country, and directed by Him in whose governance 
<A NAME="651"></A>it is.

<A NAME="655"></A>set upon the matter according to its worth. And what marvel if thou purchase 
<A NAME="656"></A>so great a thing at so great and high a price? For the sake of this that 
<A NAME="657"></A>men deem liberty, some hang themselves, others cast themselves down from 
<A NAME="658"></A>the rock; aye, time has been when whole cities came utterly to an end: 
<A NAME="659"></A>while for the sake of Freedom that is true, and sure, and unassailable, 
<A NAME="660"></A>dost thou grudge to God what He gave, when He claims it? Wilt thou not 
<A NAME="661"></A>study, as Plato saith, to endure, not death alone, but torture, exile, 
<A NAME="662"></A>stripes--in a word, to render up all that is not thine own? Else thou wilt 
<A NAME="663"></A>be a slave amid slaves, wert thou ten thousand times a consul; aye, not 
<A NAME="664"></A>a whit the less, though thou climb the Palace steps. And thou shalt know 
<A NAME="665"></A>how true the saying of Cleanthes, that though the words of philosophers 
<A NAME="666"></A>may run counter to the opinions of the world, yet have they reason on their 
<A NAME="667"></A>side.

<A NAME="672"></A><BR><BR>I am free, I am a friend of God, ready to render Him willing obedience. 
<A NAME="673"></A>Of all else I may set store by nothing--neither by mine own body, nor possessions, 
<A NAME="674"></A>nor office, nor good report, nor, in a word, aught else beside. For it 
<A NAME="675"></A>is not His Will, that I should so set store by these things. Had it been 
<A NAME="676"></A>His pleasure, He would have placed my Good therein. But now He hath not 
<A NAME="677"></A>done so: therefore I cannot transgress one jot of His commands. In everything 
<A NAME="678"></A>hold fast to that which is thy Good--but to all else (as far as is given 
<A NAME="679"></A>thee) within the measure of Reason only, contented with this alone. Else 
<A NAME="680"></A>thou wilt meet with failure, ill success, let and hindrance. These are 
<A NAME="681"></A>the Laws ordained of God-- these are His Edicts; these a man should expound

<A NAME="688"></A>may be--to set store by it is to place thyself in subjection to another. 
<A NAME="689"></A>Where is the difference then between desiring to be a Senator, and desiring 
<A NAME="690"></A>not to be one: between thirsting for office and thirsting to be quit of 
<A NAME="691"></A>it? Where is the difference between crying, Woe is me, I know not what 
<A NAME="692"></A>to do, bound hand and foot as I am to my books so that I cannot stir! and 
<A NAME="693"></A>crying, Woe is me, I have not time to read! As though a book were not as 
<A NAME="694"></A>much an outward thing and independent of the will, as office and power 
<A NAME="695"></A>and the receptions of the great.
<A NAME="696"></A><BR><BR>Or what reason hast thou (tell me) for desiring to read? For if 
<A NAME="697"></A>thou aim at nothing beyond the mere delight of it, or gaining some scrap 
<A NAME="698"></A>of knowledge, thou art but a poor, spiritless knave. But if thou desirest 
<A NAME="699"></A>to study to its proper end, what else is this than a life that flows on 
<A NAME="700"></A>tranquil and serene? And if thy reading secures thee not serenity, what 
<A NAME="701"></A>profits it?--"Nay, but it doth secure it," quoth he, "and that is why I

<A NAME="703"></A>the mercy of every passer-by? I say not at the mercy of the Emperor or 
<A NAME="704"></A>Emperor's favorite, but such as trembles at a raven's croak and piper's 
<A NAME="705"></A>din, a fever's touch or a thousand things of like sort! Whereas the life 
<A NAME="706"></A>serene has no more certain mark than this, that it ever moves with constant

<A NAME="825"></A>Has it not yet come? Send not forth thy desire to meet it, but wait until 
<A NAME="826"></A>it reaches thee. Deal thus with children, thus with wife; thus with office, 
<A NAME="827"></A>thus with wealth--and one day thou wilt be meet to share the Banquets of 
<A NAME="828"></A>the Gods. But if thou dost not so much as touch that which is placed before 
<A NAME="829"></A>thee, but despisest it, then shalt thou not only share the Banquets of 
<A NAME="830"></A>the Gods, but their Empire also.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="831"></A><B>CLX</B>

<A NAME="832"></A><BR><BR>Remember that thou art an actor in a play, and of such sort as 
<A NAME="833"></A>the Author chooses, whether long or short. If it be his good pleasure to 
<A NAME="834"></A>assign thee the part of a beggar, a ruler, or a simple citizen, thine it 
<A NAME="835"></A>is to play it fitly. For thy business is to act the part assigned thee, 
<A NAME="836"></A>well: to choose it, is another's.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="837"></A><B>CLXI</B>

<A NAME="838"></A><BR><BR>Keep death and exile daily before thine eyes, with all else that 
<A NAME="839"></A>men deem terrible, but more especially Death. Then wilt thou never think 
<A NAME="840"></A>a mean though, nor covet anything beyond measure.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="841"></A><B>CLXII</B>

<A NAME="842"></A><BR><BR>As a mark is not set up in order to be missed, so neither is such 
<A NAME="843"></A>a thing as natural evil produced in the World.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="844"></A><B>CLXIII</B>

<A NAME="845"></A><BR><BR>Piety toward the Gods, to be sure, consists chiefly in thinking 
<A NAME="846"></A>rightly concerning them--that they are, and that they govern the Universe 
<A NAME="847"></A>with goodness and justice; and that thou thyself art appointed to obey 
<A NAME="848"></A>them, and to submit under all circumstances that arise; acquiescing cheerfully 
<A NAME="849"></A>in whatever may happen, sure it is brought to pass and accomplished by 
<A NAME="850"></A>the most Perfect Understanding. Thus thou wilt never find fault with the 
<A NAME="851"></A>Gods, nor charge them with neglecting thee.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="852"></A><B>CLXIV</B>

<A NAME="853"></A><BR><BR>Lose no time in setting before you a certain stamp of character 
<A NAME="854"></A>and behaviour both when by yourself and in company with others. Let silence 
<A NAME="855"></A>be your general rule; or say only what is necessary and in few words. We 
<A NAME="856"></A>shall, however, when occassion demands, enter into discourse sparingly. 
<A NAME="857"></A>avoiding common topics as gladiators, horse-races, athletes; and the perpetual 
<A NAME="858"></A>talk about food and drink. Above all avoid speaking of persons, either 
<A NAME="859"></A>in way of praise or blame, or comparison.
<A NAME="860"></A><BR><BR>If you can, win over the conversation of your company to what it 
<A NAME="861"></A>should be by your own. But if you find yourself cut off without escape 
<A NAME="862"></A>among strangers and aliens, be silent.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="863"></A><B>CLXV</B>

<A NAME="864"></A><BR><BR>Laughter should not be much, nor frequent, nor 
<A NAME="865"></A>unrestrained.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="866"></A><B>CLXVI</B>

<A NAME="867"></A><BR><BR>Refuse altogether to take an oath if you can, if not, as far as 
<A NAME="868"></A>may be.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="869"></A><B>CLXVII</B>

<A NAME="870"></A><BR><BR>Banquets of the unlearned and of them that are without, avoid. 
<A NAME="871"></A>But if you have occasion to take part in them, let not your attention be 
<A NAME="872"></A>relaxed for a moment, lest you slip after all into evil ways. For you may 
<A NAME="873"></A>rest assured that be a man ever so pure himself, he cannot escape defilement 
<A NAME="874"></A>if his associates are impure.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="875"></A><B>CLXVIII</B>

<A NAME="876"></A><BR><BR>Take what relates to the body as far as the bare use warrants--as 
<A NAME="877"></A>meat, drink, raiment, house and servants. But all that makes for show and 
<A NAME="878"></A>luxury reject.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="879"></A><B>CLXIX</B>

<A NAME="880"></A><BR><BR>If you are told that such an one speaks ill of you, make no defence 
<A NAME="881"></A>against what was said, but answer, He surely knew not my other faults, 
<A NAME="882"></A>else he would not have mentioned these only!
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="883"></A><B>CLXX</B>

<A NAME="884"></A><BR><BR>When you visit any of those in power, bethink yourself that you 
<A NAME="885"></A>will not find him in: that you may not be admitted: that the door may be 
<A NAME="886"></A>shut in your face: that he may not concern himself about you. If with all 
<A NAME="887"></A>this, it is your duty to go, bear what happens, and never say to yourself, 
<A NAME="888"></A>It was not worth the trouble! For that would smack of the foolish and unlearned 
<A NAME="889"></A>who suffer outward things to touch them.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="890"></A><B>CLXXI</B>

<A NAME="891"></A><BR><BR>In company avoid frequent and undue talk about your own actions 
<A NAME="892"></A>and dangers. However pleasant it may be to you to enlarge upon the risks 
<A NAME="893"></A>you have run, others may not find such pleasure in listening to your adventures. 
<A NAME="894"></A>Avoid provoking laughter also: it is a habit from which one easily slides 
<A NAME="895"></A>into the ways of the foolish, and apt to diminish the respect which your 
<A NAME="896"></A>neighbors feel for you. To border on coarse talk is also dangerous. On 
<A NAME="897"></A>such occasions, if a convenient opportunity offer, rebuke the speaker. 
<A NAME="898"></A>If not, at least by relapsing into silence, colouring, and looking annoyed, 
<A NAME="899"></A>show that you are displeased with the subject.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="900"></A><B>CLXXII</B>

<A NAME="901"></A><BR><BR>When you have decided that a thing ought to be done, and are doing 
<A NAME="902"></A>it, never shun being seen doing it, even though the multitude should be 
<A NAME="903"></A>likely to judge the matter amiss. For if you are not acting rightly, shun 
<A NAME="904"></A>the act itself; if rightly, however, why fear misplaced 
<A NAME="905"></A>censure?
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="906"></A><B>CLXXIII</B>

<A NAME="907"></A><BR><BR>It stamps a man of mean capacity to spend much time on the things 
<A NAME="908"></A>of the body, as to be long over bodily exercises, long over eating, long 
<A NAME="909"></A>over drinking, long over other bodily functions. Rather should these things 
<A NAME="910"></A>take the second place, while all your care is directed to the 
<A NAME="911"></A>understanding.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="912"></A><B>CLXXIV</B>

<A NAME="913"></A><BR><BR>Everything has two handles, one by which it may be borne, the other 
<A NAME="914"></A>by which it may not. If your brother sin against you lay not hold of it 
<A NAME="915"></A>by the handle of injustice, for by that it may not be borne: but rather 
<A NAME="916"></A>by this, that he is your brother, the comrade of your youth; and thus you 
<A NAME="917"></A>will lay hold on it so that it may be borne.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="918"></A><B>CLXXV</B>

<A NAME="919"></A><BR><BR>Never call yourself a Philosopher nor talk much among the unlearned 
<A NAME="920"></A>about Principles, but do that which follows from them. Thus at a banquet, 
<A NAME="921"></A>do not discuss how people ought to eat; but eat as you ought. Remember 
<A NAME="922"></A>that Socrates thus entirely avoided ostentation. Men would come to him 
<A NAME="923"></A>desiring to be recommended to philosophers, and he would conduct them thither 
<A NAME="924"></A>himself--so well did he bear being overlooked. Accordingly if any talk 
<A NAME="925"></A>concerning principles should arise among the unlearned, be you for the 
<A NAME="926"></A>most part silent. For you run great risk of spewing up what you have ill 
<A NAME="927"></A>digested. And when a man tells you that you know nothing and you are not 
<A NAME="928"></A>nettled at it, then you may be sure that you have begun the 
<A NAME="929"></A>work.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="930"></A><B>CLXXVI</B>

<A NAME="931"></A><BR><BR>When you have brought yourself to supply the needs of the body 
<A NAME="932"></A>at small cost, do not pique yourself on that, nor if you drink only water, 
<A NAME="933"></A>keep saying on each occasion, I drink water! And if you ever want to practise 
<A NAME="934"></A>endurance and toil, do so unto yourself and not unto others--do not embrace 
<A NAME="935"></A>statues!
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="936"></A><B>CLXXVII</B>

<A NAME="937"></A><BR><BR>When a man prides himself on being able to understand and interpret 
<A NAME="938"></A>the writings of Chrysippus, say to yourself:--
<A NAME="939"></A><BR><BR>If Chrysippus had not written obscurely, this fellow would have 
<A NAME="940"></A>had nothing to be proud of. But what is it that I desire? To understand 
<A NAME="941"></A>Nature, and to follow her! Accordingly I ask who is the Interpreter. On 
<A NAME="942"></A>hearing that it is Chrysippus, I go to him. But it seems I do not understand 
<A NAME="943"></A>what he wrote. So I seek one to interpret that. So far there is nothing 
<A NAME="944"></A>to pride myself on. But when I have found my interpreter, what remains 
<A NAME="945"></A>is to put in practice his instructions. This itself is the only thing to 
<A NAME="946"></A>be proud of. But if I admire the interpretation and that alone, what else 
<A NAME="947"></A>have I turned out but a mere commentator instead of a lover of wisdom?--except 
<A NAME="948"></A>indeed that I happen to be interpreting Chrysippus instead of Homer. So 
<A NAME="949"></A>when any one says to me, Prithee, read me Chrysippus, I am more inclined 
<A NAME="950"></A>to blush, when I cannot show my deeds to be in harmony and accordance with 
<A NAME="951"></A>his sayings.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="952"></A><B>CLXXVIII</B>

<A NAME="953"></A><BR><BR>At feasts, remember that you are entertaining two guests, body 
<A NAME="954"></A>and soul. What you give to the body, you presently lose; what you give 
<A NAME="955"></A>to the soul, you keep for ever.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="956"></A><B>CLXXIX</B>

<A NAME="957"></A><BR><BR>At meals, see to it that those who serve be not more in number 
<A NAME="958"></A>than those who are served. It is absurd for a crowd of persons to be dancing 
<A NAME="959"></A>attendance on half a dozen chairs.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="960"></A><B>CLXXX</B>

<A NAME="961"></A><BR><BR>It is best to share with your attendants what is going forward, 
<A NAME="962"></A>both in the labour of preparation and in the enjoyment of the feast itself. 
<A NAME="963"></A>If such a thing be difficult at the time, recollect that you who are not 
<A NAME="964"></A>weary are being served by those that are; you who are eating and drinking 
<A NAME="965"></A>by those who do neither; you who are talking by those who are silent; you 
<A NAME="966"></A>who are at ease by those who are under constraint. Thus no sudden wrath 
<A NAME="967"></A>will betray you into unreasonable conduct, nor will you behave harshly 
<A NAME="968"></A>by irritating another.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="969"></A><B>CLXXXI</B>

<A NAME="970"></A><BR><BR>When Xanthippe was chiding Socrates for making scanty preparation 
<A NAME="971"></A>for entertaining his friends, he answered:--"If they are friends of our, 
<A NAME="972"></A>they will not care for that; if they are not, we shall care nothing for 
<A NAME="973"></A>them!"
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="974"></A><B>CLXXXII</B>

<A NAME="975"></A><BR><BR>Asked, Who is the rich man? Epictetus replied, "He who is 
<A NAME="976"></A>content."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="977"></A><B>CLXXXIII</B>

<A NAME="978"></A><BR><BR>Favorinus tells us how Epictetus would also say that there were 
<A NAME="979"></A>two faults far graver and fouler than any others--inability to bear, and 
<A NAME="980"></A>inability to forbear, when we neither patiently bear the blows that must 
<A NAME="981"></A>be borne, nor abstain from the things and the pleasures we ought to abstain 
<A NAME="982"></A>from. "So," he went on, "if a man will only have these two words at heart, 
<A NAME="983"></A>and heed them carefully by ruling and watching over himself, he will for 
<A NAME="984"></A>the most part fall into no sin, and his life will be tranquil and serene." 
<A NAME="985"></A>He meant the words --"Bear and Forbear."
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="986"></A><B>CLXXXIV</B>

<A NAME="987"></A><BR><BR>On all occasions these thoughts should be at 
<A NAME="988"></A>hand:--
<A NAME="989"></A><BR><BR>Lead me, O God, and Thou, O Destiny Be what it may the goal appointed 
<A NAME="990"></A>me, Bravely I'll follow; nay, and if I would not, I'd prove a coward, yet 
<A NAME="991"></A>must follow still!
<A NAME="992"></A><BR><BR>Again:
<A NAME="993"></A><BR><BR>Who to Necessity doth bow aright, Is learn'd in wisdom and the 
<A NAME="994"></A>things of God.
<A NAME="995"></A><BR><BR>Once more:--
<A NAME="996"></A><BR><BR>Crito, if this be God's will, so let it be. As for me, Anytus and 
<A NAME="997"></A>Meletus can indeed put me to death, but injure me, never!
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="998"></A><B>CLXXXV</B>

<A NAME="999"></A><BR><BR>We shall then be like Socrates, when we can indite hymns of praise 
<A NAME="1000"></A>to the Gods in prison.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1001"></A><B>CLXXXVI</B>

<A NAME="1002"></A><BR><BR>It is hard to combine and unite these two qualities, the carefulness 
<A NAME="1003"></A>of one who is affected by circumstances, and the intrepidity of one who 
<A NAME="1004"></A>heeds them not. But it is not impossible: else were happiness also impossible. 
<A NAME="1005"></A>We should act as we do in seafaring.
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR><BR>"What can I do?"--Choose the master, the crew, the day, the opportunity. 
<A NAME="1007"></A>Then comes a sudden storm. What matters it to me? my part has been fully 
<A NAME="1008"></A>done. The matter is in the hands of another-- the Master of the ship. The 
<A NAME="1009"></A>ship is foundering. What then have I to do? I do the only thing that remains 
<A NAME="1010"></A>to me--to be drowned without fear, without a cry, without upbraiding God, 
<A NAME="1011"></A>but knowing that what has been born must likewise perish. For I am not 
<A NAME="1012"></A>Eternity, but a human being--a part of the whole, as an hour is part of 
<A NAME="1013"></A>the day. I must come like the hour, and like the hour must 
<A NAME="1014"></A>pass!
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1015"></A><B>CLXXXVII</B>

<A NAME="1016"></A><BR><BR>And now we are sending you to Rome to spy out the land; but none 
<A NAME="1017"></A>send a coward as such a spy, that, if he hear but a noise and see a shadow 
<A NAME="1018"></A>moving anywhere, loses his wits and comes flying to say, The enemy are 
<A NAME="1019"></A>upon us!
<A NAME="1020"></A><BR><BR>So if you go now, and come and tell us: "Everything at Rome is 
<A NAME="1021"></A>terrible: Death is terrible, Exile is terrible, Slander is terrible, Want 
<A NAME="1022"></A>is terrible; fly, comrades! the enemy are upon us!" we shall reply, Get 
<A NAME="1023"></A>you gone, and prophesy to yourself! we have but erred in sending such a 
<A NAME="1024"></A>spy as you. Diogenes, who was sent as a spy long before you, brought us 
<A NAME="1025"></A>back another report than this. He says that Death is no evil; for it need 
<A NAME="1026"></A>not even bring shame with it. He says that Fame is but the empty noise 
<A NAME="1027"></A>of madmen. And what report did this spy bring us of Pain, what of Pleasure, 
<A NAME="1028"></A>what of Want? That to be clothed in sackcloth is better than any purple 
<A NAME="1029"></A>robe; that sleeping on the bare ground is the softest couch; and in proof 
<A NAME="1030"></A>of each assertion he points to his own courage, constancy, and freedom; 
<A NAME="1031"></A>to his own healthy and muscular frame. "There is no enemy near," he cries, 
<A NAME="1032"></A>"all is perfect peace!"
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1033"></A><B>CLXXXVIII</B>

<A NAME="1034"></A><BR><BR>If a man has this peace--not the peace proclaimed by Caesar (how 
<A NAME="1035"></A>indeed should he have it to proclaim?), nay, but the peace proclaimed by 
<A NAME="1036"></A>God through reason, will not that suffice him when alone, when he beholds 
<A NAME="1037"></A>and reflects:--Now can no evil happen unto me; for me there is no robber, 
<A NAME="1038"></A>for me no earthquake; all things are full of peace, full of tranquillity; 
<A NAME="1039"></A>neither highway nor city nor gathering of men, neither neighbor nor comrade 
<A NAME="1040"></A>can do me hurt. Another supplies my food, whose care it is; another my 
<A NAME="1041"></A>raiment; another hath given me perceptions of sense and primary conceptions. 
<A NAME="1042"></A>And when He supplies my necessities no more, it is that He is sounding 
<A NAME="1043"></A>the retreat, that He hath opened the door, and is saying to thee, Come!--Wither? 
<A NAME="1044"></A>To nought that thou needest fear, but to the friendly kindred elements 
<A NAME="1045"></A>whence thou didst spring. Whatsoever of fire is in thee, unto fire shall 
<A NAME="1046"></A>return; whatsoever of earth, unto earth; of spirit, unto spirit; of water, 
<A NAME="1047"></A>unto water. There is no Hades, no fabled rivers of Sighs, of Lamentation, 
<A NAME="1048"></A>or of Fire: but all things are full of Beings spiritual and divine. With 
<A NAME="1049"></A>thoughts like these, beholding the Sun, Moon, and Stars, enjoying earth 
<A NAME="1050"></A>and sea, a man is neither helpless nor alone!
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1051"></A><B>CLXXXIX</B>

<A NAME="1052"></A><BR><BR>What wouldst thou be found doing when overtaken by Death? If I 
<A NAME="1053"></A>might choose, I would be found doing some deed of true humanity, of wide 
<A NAME="1054"></A>import, beneficent and noble. But if I may not be found engaged in aught 
<A NAME="1055"></A>so lofty, let me hope at least for this--what none may hinder, what is 
<A NAME="1056"></A>surely in my power--that I may be found raising up in myself that which 
<A NAME="1057"></A>had fallen; learning to deal more wisely with the things of sense; working 
<A NAME="1058"></A>out my own tranquillity, and thus rendering that which is its due to every 
<A NAME="1059"></A>relation of life. . . .
<A NAME="1060"></A><BR><BR>If death surprise me thus employed, it is enough if I can stretch 
<A NAME="1061"></A>forth my hands to God and say, "The faculties which I received at Thy hands 
<A NAME="1062"></A>for apprehending this thine Administration, I have not neglected. As far 
<A NAME="1063"></A>as in me lay, I have done Thee no dishonour. Behold how I have used the 
<A NAME="1064"></A>senses, the primary conceptions which Thous gavest me. Have I ever laid 
<A NAME="1065"></A>anything to Thy charge? Have I ever murmured at aught that came to pass, 
<A NAME="1066"></A>or wished it otherwise? Have I in anything transgressed the relations of 
<A NAME="1067"></A>life? For that Thou didst beget me, I thank Thee for that Thou hast given: 
<A NAME="1068"></A>for the time during which I have used the things that were Thine, it suffices 
<A NAME="1069"></A>me. Take them back and place them wherever Thou wilt! They were all Thine, 
<A NAME="1070"></A>and Thou gavest them me."--If a man depart thus minded, is it not enough? 
<A NAME="1071"></A>What life is fairer and more noble, what end happier than 
<A NAME="1072"></A>his?

<A NAME="end"></A>
