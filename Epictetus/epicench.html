<BR><BR>Translated by Elizabeth Carter</DIV>
<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A><B>1.</B> Some things are in our control and others not. Things in our 
<A NAME="11"></A>control are opinion, pursuit, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever 
<A NAME="12"></A>are our own actions. Things not in our control are body, property, reputation, 
<A NAME="13"></A>command, and, in one word, whatever are not our own 
<A NAME="14"></A>actions.
<A NAME="15"></A><BR><BR>The things in our control are by nature free, unrestrained, unhindered; 
<A NAME="16"></A>but those not in our control are weak, slavish, restrained, belonging to 
<A NAME="17"></A>others. Remember, then, that if you suppose that things which are slavish 
<A NAME="18"></A>by nature are also free, and that what belongs to others is your own, then 
<A NAME="19"></A>you will be hindered. You will lament, you will be disturbed, and you will 
<A NAME="20"></A>find fault both with gods and men. But if you suppose that only to be your 
<A NAME="21"></A>own which is your own, and what belongs to others such as it really is, 
<A NAME="22"></A>then no one will ever compel you or restrain you. Further, you will find 
<A NAME="23"></A>fault with no one or accuse no one. You will do nothing against your will. 
<A NAME="24"></A>No one will hurt you, you will have no enemies, and you not be 
<A NAME="25"></A>harmed.
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR>Aiming therefore at such great things, remember that you must not 
<A NAME="27"></A>allow yourself to be carried, even with a slight tendency, towards the 
<A NAME="28"></A>attainment of lesser things. Instead, you must entirely quit some things 
<A NAME="29"></A>and for the present postpone the rest. But if you would both have these 
<A NAME="30"></A>great things, along with power and riches, then you will not gain even 
<A NAME="31"></A>the latter, because you aim at the former too: but you will absolutely 
<A NAME="32"></A>fail of the former, by which alone happiness and freedom are 
<A NAME="33"></A>achieved.
<A NAME="34"></A><BR><BR>Work, therefore to be able to say to every harsh appearance, "You 
<A NAME="35"></A>are but an appearance, and not absolutely the thing you appear to be." 
<A NAME="36"></A>And then examine it by those rules which you have, and first, and chiefly, 
<A NAME="37"></A>by this: whether it concerns the things which are in our own control, or 
<A NAME="38"></A>those which are not; and, if it concerns anything not in our control, be 
<A NAME="39"></A>prepared to say that it is nothing to you.
<A NAME="40"></A><BR><BR><B>2.</B> Remember that following desire promises the attainment 
<A NAME="41"></A>of that of which you are desirous; and aversion promises the avoiding that 
<A NAME="42"></A>to which you are averse. However, he who fails to obtain the object of 
<A NAME="43"></A>his desire is disappointed, and he who incurs the object of his aversion 
<A NAME="44"></A>wretched. If, then, you confine your aversion to those objects only which 
<A NAME="45"></A>are contrary to the natural use of your faculties, which you have in your 
<A NAME="46"></A>own control, you will never incur anything to which you are averse. But 
<A NAME="47"></A>if you are averse to sickness, or death, or poverty, you will be wretched. 
<A NAME="48"></A>Remove aversion, then, from all things that are not in our control, and 
<A NAME="49"></A>transfer it to things contrary to the nature of what is in our control. 
<A NAME="50"></A>But, for the present, totally suppress desire: for, if you desire any of 
<A NAME="51"></A>the things which are not in your own control, you must necessarily be disappointed; 
<A NAME="52"></A>and of those which are, and which it would be laudable to desire, nothing 
<A NAME="53"></A>is yet in your possession. Use only the appropriate actions of pursuit 
<A NAME="54"></A>and avoidance; and even these lightly, and with gentleness and 
<A NAME="55"></A>reservation.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR><B>3.</B> With regard to whatever objects give you delight, are 
<A NAME="57"></A>useful, or are deeply loved, remember to tell yourself of what general 
<A NAME="58"></A>nature they are, beginning from the most insignificant things. If, for 
<A NAME="59"></A>example, you are fond of a specific ceramic cup, remind yourself that it 
<A NAME="60"></A>is only ceramic cups in general of which you are fond. Then, if it breaks, 
<A NAME="61"></A>you will not be disturbed. If you kiss your child, or your wife, say that 
<A NAME="62"></A>you only kiss things which are human, and thus you will not be disturbed 
<A NAME="63"></A>if either of them dies.
<A NAME="64"></A><BR><BR><B>4.</B> When you are going about any action, remind yourself 
<A NAME="65"></A>what nature the action is. If you are going to bathe, picture to yourself 
<A NAME="66"></A>the things which usually happen in the bath: some people splash the water, 
<A NAME="67"></A>some push, some use abusive language, and others steal. Thus you will more 
<A NAME="68"></A>safely go about this action if you say to yourself, "I will now go bathe, 
<A NAME="69"></A>and keep my own mind in a state conformable to nature." And in the same 
<A NAME="70"></A>manner with regard to every other action. For thus, if any hindrance arises 
<A NAME="71"></A>in bathing, you will have it ready to say, "It was not only to bathe that 
<A NAME="72"></A>I desired, but to keep my mind in a state conformable to nature; and I 
<A NAME="73"></A>will not keep it if I am bothered at things that happen.
<A NAME="74"></A><BR><BR><B>5.</B> Men are disturbed, not by things, but by the principles 
<A NAME="75"></A>and notions which they form concerning things. Death, for instance, is 
<A NAME="76"></A>not terrible, else it would have appeared so to Socrates. But the terror 
<A NAME="77"></A>consists in our notion of death that it is terrible. When therefore we 
<A NAME="78"></A>are hindered, or disturbed, or grieved, let us never attribute it to others, 
<A NAME="79"></A>but to ourselves; that is, to our own principles. An uninstructed person 
<A NAME="80"></A>will lay the fault of his own bad condition upon others. Someone just starting 
<A NAME="81"></A>instruction will lay the fault on himself. Some who is perfectly instructed 
<A NAME="82"></A>will place blame neither on others nor on himself.
<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR><B>6.</B> Don't be prideful with any excellence that is not your 
<A NAME="84"></A>own. If a horse should be prideful and say, " I am handsome," it would 
<A NAME="85"></A>be supportable. But when you are prideful, and say, " I have a handsome 
<A NAME="86"></A>horse," know that you are proud of what is, in fact, only the good of the 
<A NAME="87"></A>horse. What, then, is your own? Only your reaction to the appearances of 
<A NAME="88"></A>things. Thus, when you behave conformably to nature in reaction to how 
<A NAME="89"></A>things appear, you will be proud with reason; for you will take pride in 
<A NAME="90"></A>some good of your own.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR><B>7.</B> Consider when, on a voyage, your ship is anchored; if 
<A NAME="92"></A>you go on shore to get water you may along the way amuse yourself with 
<A NAME="93"></A>picking up a shellfish, or an onion. However, your thoughts and continual 
<A NAME="94"></A>attention ought to be bent towards the ship, waiting for the captain to 
<A NAME="95"></A>call on board; you must then immediately leave all these things, otherwise 
<A NAME="96"></A>you will be thrown into the ship, bound neck and feet like a sheep. So 
<A NAME="97"></A>it is with life. If, instead of an onion or a shellfish, you are given 
<A NAME="98"></A>a wife or child, that is fine. But if the captain calls, you must run to 
<A NAME="99"></A>the ship, leaving them, and regarding none of them. But if you are old, 
<A NAME="100"></A>never go far from the ship: lest, when you are called, you should be unable 
<A NAME="101"></A>to come in time.
<A NAME="102"></A><BR><BR><B>8.</B> Don't demand that things happen as you wish, but wish 
<A NAME="103"></A>that they happen as they do happen, and you will go on 
<A NAME="104"></A>well.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR><B>9.</B> Sickness is a hindrance to the body, but not to your 
<A NAME="106"></A>ability to choose, unless that is your choice. Lameness is a hindrance 
<A NAME="107"></A>to the leg, but not to your ability to choose. Say this to yourself with 
<A NAME="108"></A>regard to everything that happens, then you will see such obstacles as 
<A NAME="109"></A>hindrances to something else, but not to yourself.
<A NAME="110"></A><BR><BR><B>10.</B> With every accident, ask yourself what abilities you 
<A NAME="111"></A>have for making a proper use of it. If you see an attractive person, you 
<A NAME="112"></A>will find that self-restraint is the ability you have against your desire. 
<A NAME="113"></A>If you are in pain, you will find fortitude. If you hear unpleasant language, 
<A NAME="114"></A>you will find patience. And thus habituated, the appearances of things 
<A NAME="115"></A>will not hurry you away along with them.
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR><B>11.</B> Never say of anything, "I have lost it"; but, "I have 
<A NAME="117"></A>returned it." Is your child dead? It is returned. Is your wife dead? She 
<A NAME="118"></A>is returned. Is your estate taken away? Well, and is not that likewise 
<A NAME="119"></A>returned? "But he who took it away is a bad man." What difference is it 
<A NAME="120"></A>to you who the giver assigns to take it back? While he gives it to you 
<A NAME="121"></A>to possess, take care of it; but don't view it as your own, just as travelers 
<A NAME="122"></A>view a hotel.
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR><B>12.</B> If you want to improve, reject such reasonings as these: 
<A NAME="124"></A>"If I neglect my affairs, I'll have no income; if I don't correct my servant, 
<A NAME="125"></A>he will be bad." For it is better to die with hunger, exempt from grief 
<A NAME="126"></A>and fear, than to live in affluence with perturbation; and it is better 
<A NAME="127"></A>your servant should be bad, than you unhappy.
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR>Begin therefore from little things. Is a little oil spilt? A little 
<A NAME="129"></A>wine stolen? Say to yourself, "This is the price paid for apathy, for tranquillity, 
<A NAME="130"></A>and nothing is to be had for nothing." When you call your servant, it is 
<A NAME="131"></A>possible that he may not come; or, if he does, he may not do what you want. 
<A NAME="132"></A>But he is by no means of such importance that it should be in his power 
<A NAME="133"></A>to give you any disturbance.
<A NAME="134"></A><BR><BR><B>13.</B> If you want to improve, be content to be thought foolish 
<A NAME="135"></A>and stupid with regard to external things. Don't wish to be thought to 
<A NAME="136"></A>know anything; and even if you appear to be somebody important to others, 
<A NAME="137"></A>distrust yourself. For, it is difficult to both keep your faculty of choice 
<A NAME="138"></A>in a state conformable to nature, and at the same time acquire external 
<A NAME="139"></A>things. But while you are careful about the one, you must of necessity 
<A NAME="140"></A>neglect the other.
<A NAME="141"></A><BR><BR><B>14.</B> If you wish your children, and your wife, and your friends 
<A NAME="142"></A>to live for ever, you are stupid; for you wish to be in control of things 
<A NAME="143"></A>which you cannot, you wish for things that belong to others to be your 
<A NAME="144"></A>own. So likewise, if you wish your servant to be without fault, you are 
<A NAME="145"></A>a fool; for you wish vice not to be vice," but something else. But, if 
<A NAME="146"></A>you wish to have your desires undisappointed, this is in your own control. 
<A NAME="147"></A>Exercise, therefore, what is in your control. He is the master of every 
<A NAME="148"></A>other person who is able to confer or remove whatever that person wishes 
<A NAME="149"></A>either to have or to avoid. Whoever, then, would be free, let him wish 
<A NAME="150"></A>nothing, let him decline nothing, which depends on others else he must 
<A NAME="151"></A>necessarily be a slave.
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR><B>15.</B> Remember that you must behave in life as at a dinner 
<A NAME="153"></A>party. Is anything brought around to you? Put out your hand and take your 
<A NAME="154"></A>share with moderation. Does it pass by you? Don't stop it. Is it not yet 
<A NAME="155"></A>come? Don't stretch your desire towards it, but wait till it reaches you. 
<A NAME="156"></A>Do this with regard to children, to a wife, to public posts, to riches, 
<A NAME="157"></A>and you will eventually be a worthy partner of the feasts of the gods. 
<A NAME="158"></A>And if you don't even take the things which are set before you, but are 
<A NAME="159"></A>able even to reject them, then you will not only be a partner at the feasts 
<A NAME="160"></A>of the gods, but also of their empire. For, by doing this, Diogenes, Heraclitus 
<A NAME="161"></A>and others like them, deservedly became, and were called, 
<A NAME="162"></A>divine.
<A NAME="163"></A><BR><BR><B>16.</B> When you see anyone weeping in grief because his son 
<A NAME="164"></A>has gone abroad, or is dead, or because he has suffered in his affairs, 
<A NAME="165"></A>be careful that the appearance may not misdirect you. Instead, distinguish 
<A NAME="166"></A>within your own mind, and be prepared to say, "It's not the accident that 
<A NAME="167"></A>distresses this person., because it doesn't distress another person; it 
<A NAME="168"></A>is the judgment which he makes about it." As far as words go, however, 
<A NAME="169"></A>don't reduce yourself to his level, and certainly do not moan with him. 
<A NAME="170"></A>Do not moan inwardly either.
<A NAME="171"></A><BR><BR><B>17.</B> Remember that you are an actor in a drama, of such a 
<A NAME="172"></A>kind as the author pleases to make it. If short, of a short one; if long, 
<A NAME="173"></A>of a long one. If it is his pleasure you should act a poor man, a cripple, 
<A NAME="174"></A>a governor, or a private person, see that you act it naturally. For this 
<A NAME="175"></A>is your business, to act well the character assigned you; to choose it 
<A NAME="176"></A>is another's.
<A NAME="177"></A><BR><BR><B>18.</B> When a raven happens to croak unluckily, don't allow 
<A NAME="178"></A>the appearance hurry you away with it, but immediately make the distinction 
<A NAME="179"></A>to yourself, and say, "None of these things are foretold to me; but either 
<A NAME="180"></A>to my paltry body, or property, or reputation, or children, or wife. But 
<A NAME="181"></A>to me all omens are lucky, if I will. For whichever of these things happens, 
<A NAME="182"></A>it is in my control to derive advantage from it."
<A NAME="183"></A><BR><BR><B>19.</B> You may be unconquerable, if you enter into no combat 
<A NAME="184"></A>in which it is not in your own control to conquer. When, therefore, you 
<A NAME="185"></A>see anyone eminent in honors, or power, or in high esteem on any other 
<A NAME="186"></A>account, take heed not to be hurried away with the appearance, and to pronounce 
<A NAME="187"></A>him happy; for, if the essence of good consists in things in our own control, 
<A NAME="188"></A>there will be no room for envy or emulation. But, for your part, don't 
<A NAME="189"></A>wish to be a general, or a senator, or a consul, but to be free; and the 
<A NAME="190"></A>only way to this is a contempt of things not in our own 
<A NAME="191"></A>control.
<A NAME="192"></A><BR><BR><B>20.</B> Remember, that not he who gives ill language or a blow 
<A NAME="193"></A>insults, but the principle which represents these things as insulting. 
<A NAME="194"></A>When, therefore, anyone provokes you, be assured that it is your own opinion 
<A NAME="195"></A>which provokes you. Try, therefore, in the first place, not to be hurried 
<A NAME="196"></A>away with the appearance. For if you once gain time and respite, you will 
<A NAME="197"></A>more easily command yourself.
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR><B>21.</B> Let death and exile, and all other things which appear 
<A NAME="199"></A>terrible be daily before your eyes, but chiefly death, and you win never 
<A NAME="200"></A>entertain any abject thought, nor too eagerly covet 
<A NAME="201"></A>anything.
<A NAME="202"></A><BR><BR><B>22.</B> If you have an earnest desire of attaining to philosophy, 
<A NAME="203"></A>prepare yourself from the very first to be laughed at, to be sneered by 
<A NAME="204"></A>the multitude, to hear them say,." He is returned to us a philosopher all 
<A NAME="205"></A>at once," and " Whence this supercilious look?" Now, for your part, don't 
<A NAME="206"></A>have a supercilious look indeed; but keep steadily to those things which 
<A NAME="207"></A>appear best to you as one appointed by God to this station. For remember 
<A NAME="208"></A>that, if you adhere to the same point, those very persons who at first 
<A NAME="209"></A>ridiculed will afterwards admire you. But if you are conquered by them, 
<A NAME="210"></A>you will incur a double ridicule.
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR><B>23.</B> If you ever happen to turn your attention to externals, 
<A NAME="212"></A>so as to wish to please anyone, be assured that you have ruined your scheme 
<A NAME="213"></A>of life. Be contented, then, in everything with being a philosopher; and, 
<A NAME="214"></A>if you wish to be thought so likewise by anyone, appear so to yourself, 
<A NAME="215"></A>and it will suffice you.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR><BR><B>24.</B> Don't allow such considerations as these distress you. 
<A NAME="217"></A>"I will live in dishonor, and be nobody anywhere." For, if dishonor is 
<A NAME="218"></A>an evil, you can no more be involved in any evil by the means of another, 
<A NAME="219"></A>than be engaged in anything base. Is it any business of yours, then, to 
<A NAME="220"></A>get power, or to be admitted to an entertainment? By no means. How, then, 
<A NAME="221"></A>after all, is this a dishonor? And how is it true that you will be nobody 
<A NAME="222"></A>anywhere, when you ought to be somebody in those things only which are 
<A NAME="223"></A>in your own control, in which you may be of the greatest consequence? "But 
<A NAME="224"></A>my friends will be unassisted." -- What do you mean by unassisted? They 
<A NAME="225"></A>will not have money from you, nor will you make them Roman citizens. Who 
<A NAME="226"></A>told you, then, that these are among the things in our own control, and 
<A NAME="227"></A>not the affair of others? And who can give to another the things which 
<A NAME="228"></A>he has not himself? "Well, but get them, then, that we too may have a share." 
<A NAME="229"></A>If I can get them with the preservation of my own honor and fidelity and 
<A NAME="230"></A>greatness of mind, show me the way and I will get them; but if you require 
<A NAME="231"></A>me to lose my own proper good that you may gain what is not good, consider 
<A NAME="232"></A>how inequitable and foolish you are. Besides, which would you rather have, 
<A NAME="233"></A>a sum of money, or a friend of fidelity and honor? Rather assist me, then, 
<A NAME="234"></A>to gain this character than require me to do those things by which I may 
<A NAME="235"></A>lose it. Well, but my country, say you, as far as depends on me, will be 
<A NAME="236"></A>unassisted. Here again, what assistance is this you mean? "It will not 
<A NAME="237"></A>have porticoes nor baths of your providing." And what signifies that? Why, 
<A NAME="238"></A>neither does a smith provide it with shoes, or a shoemaker with arms. It 
<A NAME="239"></A>is enough if everyone fully performs his own proper business. And were 
<A NAME="240"></A>you to supply it with another citizen of honor and fidelity, would not 
<A NAME="241"></A>he be of use to it? Yes. Therefore neither are you yourself useless to 
<A NAME="242"></A>it. "What place, then, say you, will I hold in the state?" Whatever you 
<A NAME="243"></A>can hold with the preservation of your fidelity and honor. But if, by desiring 
<A NAME="244"></A>to be useful to that, you lose these, of what use can you be to your country 
<A NAME="245"></A>when you are become faithless and void of shame.
<A NAME="246"></A><BR><BR><B>25.</B> Is anyone preferred before you at an entertainment, 
<A NAME="247"></A>or in a compliment, or in being admitted to a consultation? If these things 
<A NAME="248"></A>are good, you ought to be glad that he has gotten them; and if they are 
<A NAME="249"></A>evil, don't be grieved that you have not gotten them. And remember that 
<A NAME="250"></A>you cannot, without using the same means [which others do] to acquire things 
<A NAME="251"></A>not in our own control, expect to be thought worthy of an equal share of 
<A NAME="252"></A>them. For how can he who does not frequent the door of any [great] man, 
<A NAME="253"></A>does not attend him, does not praise him, have an equal share with him 
<A NAME="254"></A>who does? You are unjust, then, and insatiable, if you are unwilling to 
<A NAME="255"></A>pay the price for which these things are sold, and would have them for 
<A NAME="256"></A>nothing. For how much is lettuce sold? Fifty cents, for instance. If another, 
<A NAME="257"></A>then, paying fifty cents, takes the lettuce, and you, not paying it, go 
<A NAME="258"></A>without them, don't imagine that he has gained any advantage over you. 
<A NAME="259"></A>For as he has the lettuce, so you have the fifty cents which you did not 
<A NAME="260"></A>give. So, in the present case, you have not been invited to such a person's 
<A NAME="261"></A>entertainment, because you have not paid him the price for which a supper 
<A NAME="262"></A>is sold. It is sold for praise; it is sold for attendance. Give him then 
<A NAME="263"></A>the value, if it is for your advantage. But if you would, at the same time, 
<A NAME="264"></A>not pay the one and yet receive the other, you are insatiable, and a blockhead. 
<A NAME="265"></A>Have you nothing, then, instead of the supper? Yes, indeed, you have: the 
<A NAME="266"></A>not praising him, whom you don't like to praise; the not bearing with his 
<A NAME="267"></A>behavior at coming in.
<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR><B>26.</B> The will of nature may be learned from those things 
<A NAME="269"></A>in which we don't distinguish from each other. For example, when our neighbor's 
<A NAME="270"></A>boy breaks a cup, or the like, we are presently ready to say, "These things 
<A NAME="271"></A>will happen." Be assured, then, that when your own cup likewise is broken, 
<A NAME="272"></A>you ought to be affected just as when another's cup was broken. Apply this 
<A NAME="273"></A>in like manner to greater things. Is the child or wife of another dead? 
<A NAME="274"></A>There is no one who would not say, "This is a human accident." but if anyone's 
<A NAME="275"></A>own child happens to die, it is presently, "Alas I how wretched am I!" 
<A NAME="276"></A>But it should be remembered how we are affected in hearing the same thing 
<A NAME="277"></A>concerning others.
<A NAME="278"></A><BR><BR><B>27.</B> As a mark is not set up for the sake of missing the 
<A NAME="279"></A>aim, so neither does the nature of evil exist in the 
<A NAME="280"></A>world.
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR><B>28.</B> If a person gave your body to any stranger he met on 
<A NAME="282"></A>his way, you would certainly be angry. And do you feel no shame in handing 
<A NAME="283"></A>over your own mind to be confused and mystified by anyone who happens to 
<A NAME="284"></A>verbally attack you?
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR><B>29.</B> In every affair consider what precedes and follows, 
<A NAME="286"></A>and then undertake it. Otherwise you will begin with spirit; but not having 
<A NAME="287"></A>thought of the consequences, when some of them appear you will shamefully 
<A NAME="288"></A>desist. "I would conquer at the Olympic games." But consider what precedes 
<A NAME="289"></A>and follows, and then, if it is for your advantage, engage in the affair. 
<A NAME="290"></A>You must conform to rules, submit to a diet, refrain from dainties; exercise 
<A NAME="291"></A>your body, whether you choose it or not, at a stated hour, in heat and 
<A NAME="292"></A>cold; you must drink no cold water, nor sometimes even wine. In a word, 
<A NAME="293"></A>you must give yourself up to your master, as to a physician. Then, in the 
<A NAME="294"></A>combat, you may be thrown into a ditch, dislocate your arm, turn your ankle, 
<A NAME="295"></A>swallow dust, be whipped, and, after all, lose the victory. When you have 
<A NAME="296"></A>evaluated all this, if your inclination still holds, then go to war. Otherwise, 
<A NAME="297"></A>take notice, you will behave like children who sometimes play like wrestlers, 
<A NAME="298"></A>sometimes gladiators, sometimes blow a trumpet, and sometimes act a tragedy 
<A NAME="299"></A>when they have seen and admired these shows. Thus you too will be at one 
<A NAME="300"></A>time a wrestler, at another a gladiator, now a philosopher, then an orator; 
<A NAME="301"></A>but with your whole soul, nothing at all. Like an ape, you mimic all you 
<A NAME="302"></A>see, and one thing after another is sure to please you, but is out of favor 
<A NAME="303"></A>as soon as it becomes familiar. For you have never entered upon anything 
<A NAME="304"></A>considerately, nor after having viewed the whole matter on all sides, or 
<A NAME="305"></A>made any scrutiny into it, but rashly, and with a cold inclination. Thus 
<A NAME="306"></A>some, when they have seen a philosopher and heard a man speaking like Euphrates 
<A NAME="307"></A>(though, indeed, who can speak like him?), have a mind to be philosophers 
<A NAME="308"></A>too. Consider first, man, what the matter is, and what your own nature 
<A NAME="309"></A>is able to bear. If you would be a wrestler, consider your shoulders, your 
<A NAME="310"></A>back, your thighs; for different persons are made for different things. 
<A NAME="311"></A>Do you think that you can act as you do, and be a philosopher? That you 
<A NAME="312"></A>can eat and drink, and be angry and discontented as you are now? You must 
<A NAME="313"></A>watch, you must labor, you must get the better of certain appetites, must 
<A NAME="314"></A>quit your acquaintance, be despised by your servant, be laughed at by those 
<A NAME="315"></A>you meet; come off worse than others in everything, in magistracies, in 
<A NAME="316"></A>honors, in courts of judicature. When you have considered all these things 
<A NAME="317"></A>round, approach, if you please; if, by parting with them, you have a mind 
<A NAME="318"></A>to purchase apathy, freedom, and tranquillity. If not, don't come here; 
<A NAME="319"></A>don't, like children, be one while a philosopher, then a publican, then 
<A NAME="320"></A>an orator, and then one of Caesar's officers. These things are not consistent. 
<A NAME="321"></A>You must be one man, either good or bad. You must cultivate either your 
<A NAME="322"></A>own ruling faculty or externals, and apply yourself either to things within 
<A NAME="323"></A>or without you; that is, be either a philosopher, or one of the 
<A NAME="324"></A>vulgar.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR><B>30.</B> Duties are universally measured by relations. Is anyone 
<A NAME="326"></A>a father? If so, it is implied that the children should take care of him, 
<A NAME="327"></A>submit to him in everything, patiently listen to his reproaches, his correction. 
<A NAME="328"></A>But he is a bad father. Is you naturally entitled, then, to a good father? 
<A NAME="329"></A>No, only to a father. Is a brother unjust? Well, keep your own situation 
<A NAME="330"></A>towards him. Consider not what he does, but what you are to do to keep 
<A NAME="331"></A>your own faculty of choice in a state conformable to nature. For another 
<A NAME="332"></A>will not hurt you unless you please. You will then be hurt when you think 
<A NAME="333"></A>you are hurt. In this manner, therefore, you will find, from the idea of 
<A NAME="334"></A>a neighbor, a citizen, a general, the corresponding duties if you accustom 
<A NAME="335"></A>yourself to contemplate the several relations.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR><BR><B>31.</B> Be assured that the essential property of piety towards 
<A NAME="337"></A>the gods is to form right opinions concerning them, as existing "I and 
<A NAME="338"></A>as governing the universe with goodness and justice. And fix yourself in 
<A NAME="339"></A>this resolution, to obey them, and yield to them, and willingly follow 
<A NAME="340"></A>them in all events, as produced by the most perfect understanding. For 
<A NAME="341"></A>thus you will never find fault with the gods, nor accuse them as neglecting 
<A NAME="342"></A>you. And it is not possible for this to be effected any other way than 
<A NAME="343"></A>by withdrawing yourself from things not in our own control, and placing 
<A NAME="344"></A>good or evil in those only which are. For if you suppose any of the things 
<A NAME="345"></A>not in our own control to be either good or evil, when you are disappointed 
<A NAME="346"></A>of what you wish, or incur what you would avoid, you must necessarily find 
<A NAME="347"></A>fault with and blame the authors. For every animal is naturally formed 
<A NAME="348"></A>to fly and abhor things that appear hurtful, and the causes of them; and 
<A NAME="349"></A>to pursue and admire those which appear beneficial, and the causes of them. 
<A NAME="350"></A>It is impractical, then, that one who supposes himself to be hurt should 
<A NAME="351"></A>be happy about the person who, he thinks, hurts him, just as it is impossible 
<A NAME="352"></A>to be happy about the hurt itself. Hence, also, a father is reviled by 
<A NAME="353"></A>a son, when he does not impart to him the things which he takes to be good; 
<A NAME="354"></A>and the supposing empire to be a good made Polynices and Eteocles mutually 
<A NAME="355"></A>enemies. On this account the husbandman, the sailor, the merchant, on this 
<A NAME="356"></A>account those who lose wives and children, revile the gods. For where interest 
<A NAME="357"></A>is, there too is piety placed. So that, whoever is careful to regulate 
<A NAME="358"></A>his desires and aversions as he ought, is, by the very same means, careful 
<A NAME="359"></A>of piety likewise. But it is also incumbent on everyone to offer libations 
<A NAME="360"></A>and sacrifices and first fruits, conformably to the customs of his country, 
<A NAME="361"></A>with purity, and not in a slovenly manner, nor negligently, nor sparingly, 
<A NAME="362"></A>nor beyond his ability.
<A NAME="363"></A><BR><BR><B>32.</B> When you have recourse to divination, remember that 
<A NAME="364"></A>you know not what the event will be, and you come to learn it of the diviner; 
<A NAME="365"></A>but of what nature it is you know before you come, at least if you are 
<A NAME="366"></A>a philosopher. For if it is among the things not in our own control, it 
<A NAME="367"></A>can by no means be either good or evil. Don't, therefore, bring either 
<A NAME="368"></A>desire or aversion with you to the diviner (else you will approach him 
<A NAME="369"></A>trembling), but first acquire a distinct knowledge that every event is 
<A NAME="370"></A>indifferent and nothing to you., of whatever sort it may be, for it will 
<A NAME="371"></A>be in your power to make a right use of it, and this no one can hinder; 
<A NAME="372"></A>then come with confidence to the gods, as your counselors, and afterwards, 
<A NAME="373"></A>when any counsel is given you, remember what counselors you have assumed, 
<A NAME="374"></A>and whose advice you will neglect if you disobey. Come to divination, as 
<A NAME="375"></A>Socrates prescribed, in cases of which the whole consideration relates 
<A NAME="376"></A>to the event, and in which no opportunities are afforded by reason, or 
<A NAME="377"></A>any other art, to discover the thing proposed to be learned. When, therefore, 
<A NAME="378"></A>it is our duty to share the danger of a friend or of our country, we ought 
<A NAME="379"></A>not to consult the oracle whether we will share it with them or not. For, 
<A NAME="380"></A>though the diviner should forewarn you that the victims are unfavorable, 
<A NAME="381"></A>this means no more than that either death or mutilation or exile is portended. 
<A NAME="382"></A>But we have reason within us, and it directs, even with these hazards, 
<A NAME="383"></A>to the greater diviner, the Pythian god, who cast out of the temple the 
<A NAME="384"></A>person who gave no assistance to his friend while another was murdering 
<A NAME="385"></A>him.
<A NAME="386"></A><BR><BR><B>33.</B> Immediately prescribe some character and form of conduce 
<A NAME="387"></A>to yourself, which you may keep both alone and in company.
<A NAME="388"></A><BR><BR>Be for the most part silent, or speak merely what is necessary, 
<A NAME="389"></A>and in few words. We may, however, enter, though sparingly, into discourse 
<A NAME="390"></A>sometimes when occasion calls for it, but not on any of the common subjects, 
<A NAME="391"></A>of gladiators, or horse races, or athletic champions, or feasts, the vulgar 
<A NAME="392"></A>topics of conversation; but principally not of men, so as either to blame, 
<A NAME="393"></A>or praise, or make comparisons. If you are able, then, by your own conversation 
<A NAME="394"></A>bring over that of your company to proper subjects; but, if you happen 
<A NAME="395"></A>to be taken among strangers, be silent.
<A NAME="396"></A><BR><BR>Don't allow your laughter be much, nor on many occasions, nor 
<A NAME="397"></A>profuse.
<A NAME="398"></A><BR><BR>Avoid swearing, if possible, altogether; if not, as far as you 
<A NAME="399"></A>are able.
<A NAME="400"></A><BR><BR>Avoid public and vulgar entertainments; but, if ever an occasion 
<A NAME="401"></A>calls you to them, keep your attention upon the stretch, that you may not 
<A NAME="402"></A>imperceptibly slide into vulgar manners. For be assured that if a person 
<A NAME="403"></A>be ever so sound himself, yet, if his companion be infected, he who converses 
<A NAME="404"></A>with him will be infected likewise.
<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR>Provide things relating to the body no further than mere use; as 
<A NAME="406"></A>meat, drink, clothing, house, family. But strike off and reject everything 
<A NAME="407"></A>relating to show and delicacy.
<A NAME="408"></A><BR><BR>As far as possible, before marriage, keep yourself pure from familiarities 
<A NAME="409"></A>with women, and, if you indulge them, let it be lawfully." But don't therefore 
<A NAME="410"></A>be troublesome and full of reproofs to those who use these liberties, nor 
<A NAME="411"></A>frequently boast that you yourself don't.
<A NAME="412"></A><BR><BR>If anyone tells you that such a person speaks ill of you, don't 
<A NAME="413"></A>make excuses about what is said of you, but answer: " He does not know 
<A NAME="414"></A>my other faults, else he would not have mentioned only 
<A NAME="415"></A>these."
<A NAME="416"></A><BR><BR>It is not necessary for you to appear often at public spectacles; 
<A NAME="417"></A>but if ever there is a proper occasion for you to be there, don't appear 
<A NAME="418"></A>more solicitous for anyone than for yourself; that is, wish things to be 
<A NAME="419"></A>only just as they are, and him only to conquer who is the conqueror, for 
<A NAME="420"></A>thus you will meet with no hindrance. But abstain entirely from declamations 
<A NAME="421"></A>and derision and violent emotions. And when you come away, don't discourse 
<A NAME="422"></A>a great deal on what has passed, and what does not contribute to your own 
<A NAME="423"></A>amendment. For it would appear by such discourse that you were immoderately 
<A NAME="424"></A>struck with the show.
<A NAME="425"></A><BR><BR>Go not [of your own accord] to the rehearsals of any 
<A NAME="426"></A><BR><I>authors</I>
<A NAME="427"></A>, nor appear [at them] readily. But, if you do appear, keepyour gravity 
<A NAME="428"></A>and sedateness, and at the same time avoid being morose.
<A NAME="429"></A><BR><BR>When you are going to confer with anyone, and particularly of those 
<A NAME="430"></A>in a superior station, represent to yourself how Socrates or Zeno would 
<A NAME="431"></A>behave in such a case, and you will not be at a loss to make a proper use 
<A NAME="432"></A>of whatever may occur.
<A NAME="433"></A><BR><BR>When you are going to any of the people in power, represent to 
<A NAME="434"></A>yourself that you will not find him at home; that you will not be admitted; 
<A NAME="435"></A>that the doors will not be opened to you; that he will take no notice of 
<A NAME="436"></A>you. If, with all this, it is your duty to go, bear what happens, and never 
<A NAME="437"></A>say [to yourself], " It was not worth so much." For this is vulgar, and 
<A NAME="438"></A>like a man dazed by external things.
<A NAME="439"></A><BR><BR>In parties of conversation, avoid a frequent and excessive mention 
<A NAME="440"></A>of your own actions and dangers. For, however agreeable it may be to yourself 
<A NAME="441"></A>to mention the risks you have run, it is not equally agreeable to others 
<A NAME="442"></A>to hear your adventures. Avoid, likewise, an endeavor to excite laughter. 
<A NAME="443"></A>For this is a slippery point, which may throw you into vulgar manners, 
<A NAME="444"></A>and, besides, may be apt to lessen you in the esteem of your acquaintance. 
<A NAME="445"></A>Approaches to indecent discourse are likewise dangerous. Whenever, therefore, 
<A NAME="446"></A>anything of this sort happens, if there be a proper opportunity, rebuke 
<A NAME="447"></A>him who makes advances that way; or, at least, by silence and blushing 
<A NAME="448"></A>and a forbidding look, show yourself to be displeased by such 
<A NAME="449"></A>talk.
<A NAME="450"></A><BR><BR><B>34.</B> If you are struck by the appearance of any promised 
<A NAME="451"></A>pleasure, guard yourself against being hurried away by it; but let the 
<A NAME="452"></A>affair wait your leisure, and procure yourself some delay. Then bring to 
<A NAME="453"></A>your mind both points of time: that in which you will enjoy the pleasure, 
<A NAME="454"></A>and that in which you will repent and reproach yourself after you have 
<A NAME="455"></A>enjoyed it; and set before you, in opposition to these, how you will be 
<A NAME="456"></A>glad and applaud yourself if you abstain. And even though it should appear 
<A NAME="457"></A>to you a seasonable gratification, take heed that its enticing, and agreeable 
<A NAME="458"></A>and attractive force may not subdue you; but set in opposition to this 
<A NAME="459"></A>how much better it is to be conscious of having gained so great a 
<A NAME="460"></A>victory.
<A NAME="461"></A><BR><BR><B>35.</B> When you do anything from a clear judgment that it ought 
<A NAME="462"></A>to be done, never shun the being seen to do it, even though the world should 
<A NAME="463"></A>make a wrong supposition about it; for, if you don't act right, shun the 
<A NAME="464"></A>action itself; but, if you do, why are you afraid of those who censure 
<A NAME="465"></A>you wrongly?
<A NAME="466"></A><BR><BR><B>36.</B> As the proposition, "Either it is day or it is night," 
<A NAME="467"></A>is extremely proper for a disjunctive argument, but quite improper in a 
<A NAME="468"></A>conjunctive one, so, at a feast, to choose the largest share is very suitable 
<A NAME="469"></A>to the bodily appetite, but utterly inconsistent with the social spirit 
<A NAME="470"></A>of an entertainment. When you eat with another, then, remember not only 
<A NAME="471"></A>the value of those things which are set before you to the body, but the 
<A NAME="472"></A>value of that behavior which ought to be observed towards the person who 
<A NAME="473"></A>gives the entertainment.
<A NAME="474"></A><BR><BR><B>37.</B> If you have assumed any character above your strength, 
<A NAME="475"></A>you have both made an ill figure in that and quitted one which you might 
<A NAME="476"></A>have supported.
<A NAME="477"></A><BR><BR><B>38.</B> When walking, you are careful not to step on a nail 
<A NAME="478"></A>or turn your foot; so likewise be careful not to hurt the ruling faculty 
<A NAME="479"></A>of your mind. And, if we were to guard against this in every action, we 
<A NAME="480"></A>should undertake the action with the greater safety.
<A NAME="481"></A><BR><BR><B>39.</B> The body is to everyone the measure of the possessions 
<A NAME="482"></A>proper for it, just as the foot is of the shoe. If, therefore, you stop 
<A NAME="483"></A>at this, you will keep the measure; but if you move beyond it, you must 
<A NAME="484"></A>necessarily be carried forward, as down a cliff; as in the case of a shoe, 
<A NAME="485"></A>if you go beyond its fitness to the foot, it comes first to be gilded, 
<A NAME="486"></A>then purple, and then studded with jewels. For to that which once exceeds 
<A NAME="487"></A>a due measure, there is no bound.
<A NAME="488"></A><BR><BR><B>40.</B> Women from fourteen years old are flattered with the 
<A NAME="489"></A>title of "mistresses" by the men. Therefore, perceiving that they are regarded 
<A NAME="490"></A>only as qualified to give the men pleasure, they begin to adorn themselves, 
<A NAME="491"></A>and in that to place ill their hopes. We should, therefore, fix our attention 
<A NAME="492"></A>on making them sensible that they are valued for the appearance of decent, 
<A NAME="493"></A>modest and discreet behavior.
<A NAME="494"></A><BR><BR><B>41.</B> It is a mark of want of genius to spend much time in 
<A NAME="495"></A>things relating to the body, as to be long in our exercises, in eating 
<A NAME="496"></A>and drinking, and in the discharge of other animal functions. These should 
<A NAME="497"></A>be done incidentally and slightly, and our whole attention be engaged in 
<A NAME="498"></A>the care of the understanding.
<A NAME="499"></A><BR><BR><B>42.</B> When any person harms you, or speaks badly of you, remember 
<A NAME="500"></A>that he acts or speaks from a supposition of its being his duty. Now, it 
<A NAME="501"></A>is not possible that he should follow what appears right to you, but what 
<A NAME="502"></A>appears so to himself. Therefore, if he judges from a wrong appearance, 
<A NAME="503"></A>he is the person hurt, since he too is the person deceived. For if anyone 
<A NAME="504"></A>should suppose a true proposition to be false, the proposition is not hurt, 
<A NAME="505"></A>but he who is deceived about it. Setting out, then, from these principles, 
<A NAME="506"></A>you will meekly bear a person who reviles you, for you will say upon every 
<A NAME="507"></A>occasion, "It seemed so to him."
<A NAME="508"></A><BR><BR><B>43.</B> Everything has two handles, the one by which it may 
<A NAME="509"></A>be carried, the other by which it cannot. If your brother acts unjustly, 
<A NAME="510"></A>don't lay hold on the action by the handle of his injustice, for by that 
<A NAME="511"></A>it cannot be carried; but by the opposite, that he is your brother, that 
<A NAME="512"></A>he was brought up with you; and thus you will lay hold on it, as it is 
<A NAME="513"></A>to be carried.
<A NAME="514"></A><BR><BR><B>44.</B> These reasonings are unconnected: "I am richer than 
<A NAME="515"></A>you, therefore I am better"; "I am more eloquent than you, therefore I 
<A NAME="516"></A>am better." The connection is rather this: "I am richer than you, therefore 
<A NAME="517"></A>my property is greater than yours;" "I am more eloquent than you, therefore 
<A NAME="518"></A>my style is better than yours." But you, after all, are neither property 
<A NAME="519"></A>nor style.
<A NAME="520"></A><BR><BR><B>45.</B> Does anyone bathe in a mighty little time? Don't say 
<A NAME="521"></A>that he does it ill, but in a mighty little time. Does anyone drink a great 
<A NAME="522"></A>quantity of wine? Don't say that he does ill, but that he drinks a great 
<A NAME="523"></A>quantity. For, unless you perfectly understand the principle from which 
<A NAME="524"></A>anyone acts, how should you know if he acts ill? Thus you will not run 
<A NAME="525"></A>the hazard of assenting to any appearances but such as you fully 
<A NAME="526"></A>comprehend.
<A NAME="527"></A><BR><BR><B>46.</B> Never call yourself a philosopher, nor talk a great 
<A NAME="528"></A>deal among the unlearned about theorems, but act conformably to them. Thus, 
<A NAME="529"></A>at an entertainment, don't talk how persons ought to eat, but eat as you 
<A NAME="530"></A>ought. For remember that in this manner Socrates also universally avoided 
<A NAME="531"></A>all ostentation. And when persons came to him and desired to be recommended 
<A NAME="532"></A>by him to philosophers, he took and- recommended them, so well did he bear 
<A NAME="533"></A>being overlooked. So that if ever any talk should happen among the unlearned 
<A NAME="534"></A>concerning philosophic theorems, be you, for the most part, silent. For 
<A NAME="535"></A>there is great danger in immediately throwing out what you have not digested. 
<A NAME="536"></A>And, if anyone tells you that you know nothing, and you are not nettled 
<A NAME="537"></A>at it, then you may be sure that you have begun your business. For sheep 
<A NAME="538"></A>don't throw up the grass to show the shepherds how much they have eaten; 
<A NAME="539"></A>but, inwardly digesting their food, they outwardly produce wool and milk. 
<A NAME="540"></A>Thus, therefore, do you likewise not show theorems to the unlearned, but 
<A NAME="541"></A>the actions produced by them after they have been digested.
<A NAME="542"></A><BR><BR><B>47.</B> When you have brought yourself to supply the necessities 
<A NAME="543"></A>of your body at a small price, don't pique yourself upon it; nor, if you 
<A NAME="544"></A>drink water, be saying upon every occasion, "I drink water." But first 
<A NAME="545"></A>consider how much more sparing and patient of hardship the poor are than 
<A NAME="546"></A>we. But if at any time you would inure yourself by exercise to labor, and 
<A NAME="547"></A>bearing hard trials, do it for your own sake, and not for the world; don't 
<A NAME="548"></A>grasp statues, but, when you are violently thirsty, take a little cold 
<A NAME="549"></A>water in your mouth, and spurt it out and tell nobody.
<A NAME="550"></A><BR><BR><B>48.</B> The condition and characteristic of a vulgar person, 
<A NAME="551"></A>is, that he never expects either benefit or hurt from himself, but from 
<A NAME="552"></A>externals. The condition and characteristic of a philosopher is, that he 
<A NAME="553"></A>expects all hurt and benefit from himself. The marks of a proficient are, 
<A NAME="554"></A>that he censures no one, praises no one, blames no one, accuses no one, 
<A NAME="555"></A>says nothing concerning himself as being anybody, or knowing anything: 
<A NAME="556"></A>when he is, in any instance, hindered or restrained, he accuses himself; 
<A NAME="557"></A>and, if he is praised, he secretly laughs at the person who praises him; 
<A NAME="558"></A>and, if he is censured, he makes no defense. But he goes about with the 
<A NAME="559"></A>caution of sick or injured people, dreading to move anything that is set 
<A NAME="560"></A>right, before it is perfectly fixed. He suppresses all desire in himself; 
<A NAME="561"></A>he transfers his aversion to those things only which thwart the proper 
<A NAME="562"></A>use of our own faculty of choice; the exertion of his active powers towards 
<A NAME="563"></A>anything is very gentle; if he appears stupid or ignorant, he does not 
<A NAME="564"></A>care, and, in a word, he watches himself as an enemy, and one in 
<A NAME="565"></A>ambush.
<A NAME="566"></A><BR><BR><B>49.</B> When anyone shows himself overly confident in ability 
<A NAME="567"></A>to understand and interpret the works of Chrysippus, say to yourself, " 
<A NAME="568"></A>Unless Chrysippus had written obscurely, this person would have had no 
<A NAME="569"></A>subject for his vanity. But what do I desire? To understand nature and 
<A NAME="570"></A>follow her. I ask, then, who interprets her, and, finding Chrysippus does, 
<A NAME="571"></A>I have recourse to him. I don't understand his writings. I seek, therefore, 
<A NAME="572"></A>one to interpret them." So far there is nothing to value myself upon. And 
<A NAME="573"></A>when I find an interpreter, what remains is to make use of his instructions. 
<A NAME="574"></A>This alone is the valuable thing. But, if I admire nothing but merely the 
<A NAME="575"></A>interpretation, what do I become more than a grammarian instead of a philosopher? 
<A NAME="576"></A>Except, indeed, that instead of Homer I interpret Chrysippus. When anyone, 
<A NAME="577"></A>therefore, desires me to read Chrysippus to him, I rather blush when I 
<A NAME="578"></A>cannot show my actions agreeable and consonant to his 
<A NAME="579"></A>discourse.
<A NAME="580"></A><BR><BR><B>50.</B> Whatever moral rules you have deliberately proposed 
<A NAME="581"></A>to yourself. abide by them as they were laws, and as if you would be guilty 
<A NAME="582"></A>of impiety by violating any of them. Don't regard what anyone says of you, 
<A NAME="583"></A>for this, after all, is no concern of yours. How long, then, will you put 
<A NAME="584"></A>off thinking yourself worthy of the highest improvements and follow the 
<A NAME="585"></A>distinctions of reason? You have received the philosophical theorems, with 
<A NAME="586"></A>which you ought to be familiar, and you have been familiar with them. What 
<A NAME="587"></A>other master, then, do you wait for, to throw upon that the delay of reforming 
<A NAME="588"></A>yourself? You are no longer a boy, but a grown man. If, therefore, you 
<A NAME="589"></A>will be negligent and slothful, and always add procrastination to procrastination, 
<A NAME="590"></A>purpose to purpose, and fix day after day in which you will attend to yourself, 
<A NAME="591"></A>you will insensibly continue without proficiency, and, living and dying, 
<A NAME="592"></A>persevere in being one of the vulgar. This instant, then, think yourself 
<A NAME="593"></A>worthy of living as a man grown up, and a proficient. Let whatever appears 
<A NAME="594"></A>to be the best be to you an inviolable law. And if any instance of pain 
<A NAME="595"></A>or pleasure, or glory or disgrace, is set before you, remember that now 
<A NAME="596"></A>is the combat, now the Olympiad comes on, nor can it be put off. By once 
<A NAME="597"></A>being defeated and giving way, proficiency is lost, or by the contrary 
<A NAME="598"></A>preserved. Thus Socrates became perfect, improving himself by everything. 
<A NAME="599"></A>attending to nothing but reason. And though you are not yet a Socrates, 
<A NAME="600"></A>you ought, however, to live as one desirous of becoming a 
<A NAME="601"></A>Socrates.
<A NAME="602"></A><BR><BR><B>51.</B> The first and most necessary topic in philosophy is 
<A NAME="603"></A>that of the use of moral theorems, such as, "We ought not to lie;" the 
<A NAME="604"></A>second is that of demonstrations, such as, "What is the origin of our obligation 
<A NAME="605"></A>not to lie;" the third gives strength and articulation to the other two, 
<A NAME="606"></A>such as, "What is the origin of this is a demonstration." For what is demonstration? 
<A NAME="607"></A>What is consequence? What contradiction? What truth? What falsehood? The 
<A NAME="608"></A>third topic, then, is necessary on the account of the second, and the second 
<A NAME="609"></A>on the account of the first. But the most necessary, and that whereon we 
<A NAME="610"></A>ought to rest, is the first. But we act just on the contrary. For we spend 
<A NAME="611"></A>all our time on the third topic, and employ all our diligence about that, 
<A NAME="612"></A>and entirely neglect the first. Therefore, at the same time that we lie, 
<A NAME="613"></A>we are immediately prepared to show how it is demonstrated that lying is 
<A NAME="614"></A>not right.
<A NAME="615"></A><BR><BR><B>52.</B> Upon all occasions we ought to have these maxims ready 
<A NAME="616"></A>at hand:
<A NAME="617"></A><BR><BR>"Conduct me, Jove, and you, 0 Destiny,
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>Wherever your decrees have fixed my station." <BR><I>Cleanthes</I>

<A NAME="619"></A><BR><BR>"I follow cheerfully; and, did I not,
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>Wicked and wretched, I must follow still
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>Whoever yields properly to Fate, is deemed
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>Wise among men, and knows the laws of heaven." <BR><I>Euripides, Frag. 
<A NAME="623"></A>965</I>

<A NAME="624"></A><BR><BR>And this third:
<A NAME="625"></A><BR><BR>"0 Crito, if it thus pleases the gods, thus let it be. Anytus and 
<A NAME="626"></A>Melitus may kill me indeed, but hurt me they cannot." <BR><I>Plato's Crito 
<A NAME="627"></A>and Apology</I>
