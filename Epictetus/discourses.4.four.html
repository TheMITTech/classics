<A NAME="10"></A><B>Chapter 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>About freedom
<A NAME="12"></A><BR><BR>He is free who lives as he wishes to live; who is neither subject 
<A NAME="13"></A>to compulsion nor to hindrance, nor to force; whose movements to action 
<A NAME="14"></A>are not impeded, whose desires attain their purpose, and who does not fall 
<A NAME="15"></A>into that which he would avoid. Who, then, chooses to live in error? No 
<A NAME="16"></A>man. Who chooses to live deceived, liable to mistake, unjust, unrestrained, 
<A NAME="17"></A>discontented, mean? No man. Not one then of the bad lives as he wishes; 
<A NAME="18"></A>nor is he, then, free. And who chooses to live in sorrow, fear, envy, pity, 
<A NAME="19"></A>desiring and failing in his desires, attempting to avoid something and 
<A NAME="20"></A>falling into it? Not one. Do we then find any of the bad free from sorrow, 
<A NAME="21"></A>free from fear, who does not fall into that which he would avoid, and does 
<A NAME="22"></A>not obtain that which he wishes? Not one; nor then do we find any bad man 
<A NAME="23"></A>free.
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR>If, then, a man who has been twice consul should hear this, if 
<A NAME="25"></A>you add, "But you are a wise man; this is nothing to you": he will pardon 
<A NAME="26"></A>you. But if you tell him the truth, and say, "You differ not at all from 
<A NAME="27"></A>those who have been thrice sold as to being yourself not a slave," what 
<A NAME="28"></A>else ought you to expect than blows? For he says, "What, I a slave, I whose 
<A NAME="29"></A>father was free, whose mother was free, I whom no man can purchase: I am 
<A NAME="30"></A>also of senatorial rank, and a friend of Caesar, and I have been a consul, 
<A NAME="31"></A>and I own many slaves." In the first place, most excellent senatorial man, 
<A NAME="32"></A>perhaps your father also was a slave in the same kind of servitude, and 
<A NAME="33"></A>your mother, and your grandfather and all your ancestors in an ascending 
<A NAME="34"></A>series. But even if they were as free as it is possible, what is this to 
<A NAME="35"></A>you? What if they were of a noble nature, and you of a mean nature; if 
<A NAME="36"></A>they were fearless, and you a coward; if they had the power of self-restraint, 
<A NAME="37"></A>and you are not able to exercise it.
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR>"And what," you may say, "has this to do with being a slave?" Does 
<A NAME="39"></A>it seem to you to be nothing to do a thing unwillingly, with compulsion, 
<A NAME="40"></A>with groans, has this nothing to do with being a slave? "It is something," 
<A NAME="41"></A>you say: "but who is able to compel me, except the lord of all, Caesar?" 
<A NAME="42"></A>Then even you yourself have admitted that you have one master. But that 
<A NAME="43"></A>he is the common master of all, as you say, let not this console you at 
<A NAME="44"></A>all: but know that you are a slave in a great family. So also the people 
<A NAME="45"></A>of Nicopolis are used to exclaim, "By the fortune of Caesar, are 
<A NAME="46"></A>free."
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR>However, if you please, let us not speak of Caesar at present. 
<A NAME="48"></A>But tell me this: did you never love any person, a young girl, or slave, 
<A NAME="49"></A>or free? What then is this with respect to being a slave or free? Were 
<A NAME="50"></A>you never commanded by the person beloved to do something which you did 
<A NAME="51"></A>not wish to do? have you never flattered your little slave? have you never 
<A NAME="52"></A>kissed her feet? And yet if any man compelled you to kiss Caesar's feet, 
<A NAME="53"></A>you would think it an insult and excessive tyranny. What else, then, is 
<A NAME="54"></A>slavery? Did you never go out by night to some place whither you did not 
<A NAME="55"></A>wish to go, did you not expend what you did not wish to expend, did you 
<A NAME="56"></A>not utter words with sighs and groans, did you not submit to abuse and 
<A NAME="57"></A>to be excluded? But if you are ashamed to confess your own acts, see what 
<A NAME="58"></A>Thrasonides says and does, who having seen so much military service as 
<A NAME="59"></A>perhaps not even you have, first of all went out by night, when Geta does 
<A NAME="60"></A>not venture out, but if he were compelled by his master, would have cried 
<A NAME="61"></A>out much and would have gone out lamenting his bitter slavery. Next, what 
<A NAME="62"></A>does Thrasonides say? "A worthless girl has enslaved me, me whom no enemy, 
<A NAME="63"></A>ever did." Unhappy man, who are the slave even of a girl, and a worthless 
<A NAME="64"></A>girl. Why then do you still call yourself free? and why do you talk of 
<A NAME="65"></A>your service in the army? Then he calls for a sword and is angry with him 
<A NAME="66"></A>who out of kindness refuses it; and he sends presents to her who hates 
<A NAME="67"></A>him, and entreats and weeps, and on the other hand, having had a little 
<A NAME="68"></A>success, he is elated. But even then how? was he free enough neither to 
<A NAME="69"></A>desire nor to fear?
<A NAME="70"></A><BR><BR>Now consider in the case of animals, how we employ the notion of 
<A NAME="71"></A>liberty. Men keep tame lions shut up, and feed them, and some take them 
<A NAME="72"></A>about; and who will say that this lion is free? Is it not the fact that 
<A NAME="73"></A>the more he lives at his ease, so much the more he is in a slavish condition? 
<A NAME="74"></A>and who if he had perception and reason would wish to be one of these lions? 
<A NAME="75"></A>Well, these birds when they are caught and are kept shut up, how much do 
<A NAME="76"></A>they suffer in their attempts to escape? and some of them die of hunger 
<A NAME="77"></A>rather than submit to such a kind of life. And as many of them as live, 
<A NAME="78"></A>hardly live and with suffering pine away; and if they ever find any opening, 
<A NAME="79"></A>they make their escape. So much do they desire their natural liberty, and 
<A NAME="80"></A>to be independent and free from hindrance. And what harm is there to you 
<A NAME="81"></A>in this? "What do you say? I am formed by nature to fly where I choose, 
<A NAME="82"></A>to live in the open air, to sing when I choose: you deprive me of all this, 
<A NAME="83"></A>and say, 'What harm is it to you?' For this reason we shall say that those 
<A NAME="84"></A>animals only are free which cannot endure capture, but, as soon as they 
<A NAME="85"></A>are caught, escape from captivity by death. So Diogenes says that there 
<A NAME="86"></A>is one way to freedom, and that is to die content: and he writes to the 
<A NAME="87"></A>Persian king, "You cannot enslave the Athenian state any more than you 
<A NAME="88"></A>can enslave fishes." "How is that? cannot I catch them?" "If you catch 
<A NAME="89"></A>them," says Diogenes, "they will immediately leave you, as fishes do; for 
<A NAME="90"></A>if you catch a fish, it dies; and if these men that are caught shall die, 
<A NAME="91"></A>of what use to you is the preparation for war?" These are the words of 
<A NAME="92"></A>a free man who had carefully examined the thing and, as was natural, had 
<A NAME="93"></A>discovered it. But if you look for it in a different place from where it 
<A NAME="94"></A>is, what wonder if you never find it?
<A NAME="95"></A><BR><BR>The slave wishes to be set free immediately. Why? Do you think 
<A NAME="96"></A>that he wishes to pay money to the collectors of twentieths? No; but because 
<A NAME="97"></A>he imagines that hitherto through not having obtained this, he is hindered 
<A NAME="98"></A>and unfortunate. "If I shall be set free, immediately it is all happiness, 
<A NAME="99"></A>I care for no man, I speak to all as an equal and, like to them, I go where 
<A NAME="100"></A>I choose, I come from any place I choose, and go where I choose." Then 
<A NAME="101"></A>he is set free; and forthwith having no place where he can eat, he looks 
<A NAME="102"></A>for some man to flatter, some one with whom he shall sup: then he either 
<A NAME="103"></A>works with his body and endures the most dreadful things; and if he can 
<A NAME="104"></A>obtain a manger, he falls into a slavery much worse than his former slavery; 
<A NAME="105"></A>or even if he is become rich, being a man without any knowledge of what 
<A NAME="106"></A>is good, he loves some little girl, and in his happiness laments and desires 
<A NAME="107"></A>to be a slave again. He says, "what evil did I suffer in my state of slavery? 
<A NAME="108"></A>Another clothed me, another supplied me with shoes, another fed me, another 
<A NAME="109"></A>looked after me in sickness; and I did only a few services for him. But 
<A NAME="110"></A>now a wretched man, what things I suffer, being a slave of many instead 
<A NAME="111"></A>of to one. But however," he says, "if I shall acquire rings, then I shall 
<A NAME="112"></A>live most prosperously and happily." First, in order to acquire these rings, 
<A NAME="113"></A>he submits to that which he is worthy of; then, when he has acquired them, 
<A NAME="114"></A>it is again all the same. Then he says, "if I shall be engaged in military 
<A NAME="115"></A>service, I am free from all evils." He obtains military service. He suffers 
<A NAME="116"></A>as much as a flogged slave, and nevertheless he asks for a second service 
<A NAME="117"></A>and a third. After this, when he has put the finishing stroke to his career 
<A NAME="118"></A>and is become a senator, then he becomes a slave by entering into the assembly, 
<A NAME="119"></A>then he serves the finer and most splendid slavery- not to be a fool, but 
<A NAME="120"></A>to learn what Socrates taught, what is the nature of each thing that exists, 
<A NAME="121"></A>and that a man should not rashly adapt preconceptions to the several things 
<A NAME="122"></A>which are. For this is the cause to men of all their evils, the not being 
<A NAME="123"></A>able to adapt the general preconceptions to the several things. But we 
<A NAME="124"></A>have different opinions. One man thinks that he is sick: not so however, 
<A NAME="125"></A>but the fact is that he does not adapt his preconceptions right. Another 
<A NAME="126"></A>thinks that he is poor; another that he has a severe father or mother; 
<A NAME="127"></A>and another, again, that Caesar is not favourable to him. But all this 
<A NAME="128"></A>is one and only one thing, the not knowing how to adapt the preconceptions. 
<A NAME="129"></A>For who has not a preconception of that which is bad, that it is hurtful, 
<A NAME="130"></A>that it ought to be avoided, that it ought in every way to be guarded against? 
<A NAME="131"></A>One preconception is not repugnant to another, only where it comes to the 
<A NAME="132"></A>matter of adaptation. What then is this evil, which is both hurtful, and 
<A NAME="133"></A>a thing to be avoided? He answers, "Not to be Caesar's friend." He is gone 
<A NAME="134"></A>far from the mark, he has missed the adaptation, he is embarrassed, he 
<A NAME="135"></A>seeks the things which are not at all pertinent to the matter; for when 
<A NAME="136"></A>he has succeeded in being Caesar's friend, nevertheless he has failed in 
<A NAME="137"></A>finding what he sought. For what is that which every man seeks? To live 
<A NAME="138"></A>secure, to be happy, to do everything as he wishes, not to be hindered, 
<A NAME="139"></A>nor compelled. When then he is become the friend of Caesar, is he free 
<A NAME="140"></A>from hindrance? free from compulsion, is he tranquil, is he happy? Of whom 
<A NAME="141"></A>shall we inquire? What more trustworthy witness have we than this very 
<A NAME="142"></A>man who is, become Caesar's friend? Come forward and tell us when did you 
<A NAME="143"></A>sleep more quietly, now or before you became Caesar's friend? Immediately 
<A NAME="144"></A>you hear the answer, "Stop, I entreat you, and do not mock me: you know 
<A NAME="145"></A>not what miseries I suffer, and sleep does not come to me; but one comes 
<A NAME="146"></A>and says, 'Caesar is already awake, he is now going forth': then come troubles 
<A NAME="147"></A>and cares." Well, when did you sup with more pleasure, now or before? Hear 
<A NAME="148"></A>what he says about this also. He says that if he is not invited, he is 
<A NAME="149"></A>pained: and if he is invited, he sups like a slave with his master, all 
<A NAME="150"></A>the while being anxious that he does not say or do anything foolish. And 
<A NAME="151"></A>what do you suppose that he is afraid of; lest he should be lashed like 
<A NAME="152"></A>a slave? How can he expect anything so good? No, but as befits so great 
<A NAME="153"></A>a man, Caesar's friend, he is afraid that he may lose his head. And when 
<A NAME="154"></A>did you bathe more free from trouble, and take your gymnastic exercise 
<A NAME="155"></A>more quietly? In fine, which kind of life did you prefer? your present 
<A NAME="156"></A>or your former life? I can swear that no man is so stupid or so ignorant 
<A NAME="157"></A>of truth as not to bewail his own misfortunes the nearer he is in friendship 
<A NAME="158"></A>to Caesar.
<A NAME="159"></A><BR><BR>Since, then, neither those who are called kings live as they choose, 
<A NAME="160"></A>nor the friends of kings, who finally are those who are free? Seek, and 
<A NAME="161"></A>you will find; for you have aids from nature for the discovery of truth. 
<A NAME="162"></A>But if you are not able yourself by going along these ways only to discover 
<A NAME="163"></A>that which follows, listen to those who have made the inquiry. What do 
<A NAME="164"></A>they say? Does freedom seem to you a good thing? "The greatest good." Is 
<A NAME="165"></A>it possible, then, that he who obtains the greatest good can be unhappy 
<A NAME="166"></A>or fare badly? "No." Whomsoever, then, you shall see unhappy, unfortunate, 
<A NAME="167"></A>lamenting, confidently declare that they are not free. "I do declare it." 
<A NAME="168"></A>We have now, then, got away from buying and selling and from such arrangements 
<A NAME="169"></A>about matters of property; for if you have rightly assented to these matters, 
<A NAME="170"></A>if the Great King is unhappy, he cannot be free, nor can a little king, 
<A NAME="171"></A>nor a man of consular rank, nor one who has been twice consul. "Be it 
<A NAME="172"></A>so."
<A NAME="173"></A><BR><BR>Further, then, answer me this question also: Does freedom seem 
<A NAME="174"></A>to you to be something great and noble and valuable? "How should it not 
<A NAME="175"></A>seem so?" Is it possible, then, when a man obtains anything, so great and 
<A NAME="176"></A>valuable and noble to be mean? "It is not possible." When, then, you see 
<A NAME="177"></A>any man subject to another, or flattering him contrary to his own opinion, 
<A NAME="178"></A>confidently affirm that this man also is not free; and not only if he do 
<A NAME="179"></A>this for a bit of supper, but also if he does it for a government or a 
<A NAME="180"></A>consulship: and call these men "little slaves" who for the sake of little 
<A NAME="181"></A>matters do these things, and those who do so for the sake of great things 
<A NAME="182"></A>call "great slaves," as they deserve to be. "This is admitted also." Do 
<A NAME="183"></A>you think that freedom is a thing independent and self-governing? "Certainly." 
<A NAME="184"></A>Whomsoever, then, it is in the power of another to hinder and compel, declare 
<A NAME="185"></A>that he is not free. And do not look, I entreat you, after his grandfathers 
<A NAME="186"></A>and great-grandfathers, or inquire about his being bought or sold; but 
<A NAME="187"></A>if you hear him saying from his heart and with feeling, "Master," even 
<A NAME="188"></A>if the twelve fasces precede him, call him a slave. And if you hear him 
<A NAME="189"></A>say, "Wretch that I am, how much I suffer," call him a slave. If, finally, 
<A NAME="190"></A>you see him lamenting, complaining, unhappy, call him a slave though he 
<A NAME="191"></A>wears a praetexta. If, then, he is doing nothing of this kind, do not yet 
<A NAME="192"></A>say that he is free, but learn his opinions, whether they are subject to 
<A NAME="193"></A>compulsion, or may produce hindrance, or to bad fortune; and if you find 
<A NAME="194"></A>him such, call him a slave who has a holiday in the Saturnalia: say that 
<A NAME="195"></A>his master is from home: he will return soon, and you will know what he 
<A NAME="196"></A>suffers. "Who will return?" Whoever has in himself the power over anything 
<A NAME="197"></A>which is desired by the man, either to give it to him or to take it away? 
<A NAME="198"></A>"Thus, then, have we many masters?" We have: for we have circumstances 
<A NAME="199"></A>as masters prior to our present masters; and these circumstances are many. 
<A NAME="200"></A>Therefore it must of necessity be that those who have the power over any 
<A NAME="201"></A>of these circumstances must be our masters. For no man fears Caesar himself, 
<A NAME="202"></A>but he fears death, banishment, deprivation of his property, prison, and 
<A NAME="203"></A>disgrace. Nor does any man love Caesar, unless Caesar is a person of great 
<A NAME="204"></A>merit, but he loves wealth, the office of tribune, praetor or consul. When 
<A NAME="205"></A>we love, and hate, and fear these things, it must be that those who have 
<A NAME="206"></A>the power over them must be our masters. Therefore we adore them even as 
<A NAME="207"></A>gods; for we think that what possesses the power of conferring the greatest 
<A NAME="208"></A>advantage on us is divine. Then we wrongly assume that a certain person 
<A NAME="209"></A>has the power of conferring the greatest advantages; therefore he is something 
<A NAME="210"></A>divine. For if we wrongly assume that a certain person has the power of 
<A NAME="211"></A>conferring the greatest advantages, it is a necessary consequence that 
<A NAME="212"></A>the conclusion from these premises must be false.
<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR>What, then, is that which makes a man free from hindrance and makes 
<A NAME="214"></A>him his own master? For wealth does not do it, nor consulship, nor provincial 
<A NAME="215"></A>government, nor royal power; but something else must be discovered. What 
<A NAME="216"></A>then is that which, when we write, makes us free from hindrance and unimpeded? 
<A NAME="217"></A>"The knowledge of the art of writing." What, then, is it in playing the 
<A NAME="218"></A>lute? "The science of playing the lute." Therefore in life also it is the 
<A NAME="219"></A>science of life. You have, then, heard in a general way: but examine the 
<A NAME="220"></A>thing also in the several parts. Is it possible that he who desires any 
<A NAME="221"></A>of the things which depend on others can be free from hindrance? "No." 
<A NAME="222"></A>Is it possible for him to be unimpeded? "No." Therefore he cannot be free. 
<A NAME="223"></A>Consider then: whether we have nothing which is in our own power only, 
<A NAME="224"></A>or whether we have all things, or whether some things are in our own power, 
<A NAME="225"></A>and others in the power of others. "What do you mean?" When you wish the 
<A NAME="226"></A>body to be entire, is it in your power or not? "It is not in my power." 
<A NAME="227"></A>When you wish it to be healthy? "Neither is this in my power." When you 
<A NAME="228"></A>wish it to be handsome? "Nor is this." Life or death? "Neither is this 
<A NAME="229"></A>in my power." Your body, then, is another's, subject to every man who is 
<A NAME="230"></A>stronger than yourself? "It is." But your estate, is it in your power to 
<A NAME="231"></A>have it when you please, and as long as you please, and such as you please? 
<A NAME="232"></A>"No." And your slaves? "No." And your clothes? "No." And your house? "No." 
<A NAME="233"></A>And your horses? "Not one of these things." And if you wish by all means 
<A NAME="234"></A>your children to live, or your wife, or your brother, or your friends, 
<A NAME="235"></A>is it in your power? "This also is not in my power."
<A NAME="236"></A><BR><BR>Whether, then, have you nothing which is in your own power, which 
<A NAME="237"></A>depends on yourself only and cannot be taken from you, or have you anything 
<A NAME="238"></A>of the kind? "I know not." Look at the thing, then, thus, examine it. Is 
<A NAME="239"></A>any man able to make you assent to that which is false? "No man." In the 
<A NAME="240"></A>matter of assent, then, you are free from hindrance and obstruction. "Granted." 
<A NAME="241"></A>Well; and can a man force you to desire to move toward that to which you 
<A NAME="242"></A>do not choose? "He can, for when he threatens me with death or bonds, he 
<A NAME="243"></A>compels me to desire to move toward it." If, then, you despise death and 
<A NAME="244"></A>bonds, do you still pay any regard to him? "No." Is, then, the despising 
<A NAME="245"></A>of death an act of your own, or is it not yours? "It is my act." It is 
<A NAME="246"></A>your own act, then, also to desire to move toward a thing: or is it not 
<A NAME="247"></A>so? "It is my own act." But to desire to move away from a thing, whose 
<A NAME="248"></A>act is that? This also is your act. "What, then, if I have attempted to 
<A NAME="249"></A>walk, suppose another should hinder me." What part of you does he hinder? 
<A NAME="250"></A>does he hinder the faculty of assent? "No: but my poor body." Yes, as he 
<A NAME="251"></A>would do with a stone. "Granted; but I no longer walk." And who told you 
<A NAME="252"></A>that walking is your act free from hindrance? for I said that this only 
<A NAME="253"></A>was free from hindrance, to desire to move: but where there is need of 
<A NAME="254"></A>body and its co-operation, you have heard long ago that nothing is your 
<A NAME="255"></A>own. "Granted also." And who can compel you to desire what you do not wish? 
<A NAME="256"></A>"No man." And to propose, or intend, or in short to make use of the appearances 
<A NAME="257"></A>which present themselves, can any man compel you? "He cannot do this: but 
<A NAME="258"></A>he will hinder me when I desire from obtaining what I desire." If you desire 
<A NAME="259"></A>anything which is your own, and one of the things which cannot be hindered, 
<A NAME="260"></A>how will he hinder you? "He cannot in any way." Who, then, tells you that 
<A NAME="261"></A>he who desires the things that belong to another is free from 
<A NAME="262"></A>hindrance?
<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR>"Must I, then, not desire health?" By no means, nor anything else 
<A NAME="264"></A>that belongs to another: for what is not in your power to acquire or to 
<A NAME="265"></A>keep when you please, this belongs to another. Keep, then, far from it 
<A NAME="266"></A>not only your hands but, more than that, even your desires. If you do not, 
<A NAME="267"></A>you have surrendered yourself as a slave; you have subjected your neck, 
<A NAME="268"></A>if you admire anything not your own, to everything that is dependent on 
<A NAME="269"></A>the power of others and perishable, to which you have conceived a liking. 
<A NAME="270"></A>"Is not my hand my own?" It is a part of your own body; but it is by nature 
<A NAME="271"></A>earth, subject to hindrance, compulsion, and the slave of everything which 
<A NAME="272"></A>is stronger. And why do I say your hand? You ought to possess your whole 
<A NAME="273"></A>body as a poor ass loaded, as long as it is possible, as long as you are 
<A NAME="274"></A>allowed. But if there be a press, and a soldier should lay hold of it, 
<A NAME="275"></A>let it go, do not resist, nor murmur; if you do, you will receive blows, 
<A NAME="276"></A>and nevertheless you will also lose the ass. But when you ought to feel 
<A NAME="277"></A>thus with respect to the body, consider what remains to be done about all 
<A NAME="278"></A>the rest, which is provided for the sake of the body. When the body is 
<A NAME="279"></A>an ass, all the other things are bits belonging to the ass, pack-saddles, 
<A NAME="280"></A>shoes, barley, fodder. Let these also go: get rid of them quicker and more 
<A NAME="281"></A>readily than of the ass.
<A NAME="282"></A><BR><BR>When you have made this preparation, and have practiced this discipline, 
<A NAME="283"></A>to distinguish that which belongs to another from that which is your own, 
<A NAME="284"></A>the things which are subject to hindrance from those which are not, to 
<A NAME="285"></A>consider the things free from hindrance to concern yourself, and those 
<A NAME="286"></A>which are not free not to concern yourself, to keep your desire steadily 
<A NAME="287"></A>fixed to the things which do concern yourself, and turned from the things 
<A NAME="288"></A>which do not concern yourself; do you still fear any man? "No one." For 
<A NAME="289"></A>about what will you be afraid? about the things which are your own, in 
<A NAME="290"></A>which consists the nature of good and evil? and who has power over these 
<A NAME="291"></A>things? who can take them away? who can impede them? No man can, no more 
<A NAME="292"></A>than he can impede God. But will you be afraid about your body and your 
<A NAME="293"></A>possessions, about things which are not yours, about things which in no 
<A NAME="294"></A>way concern you? and what else have you been studying from the beginning 
<A NAME="295"></A>than to distinguish between your own and not your own, the things which 
<A NAME="296"></A>are in your power and not in your power, the things subject to hindrance 
<A NAME="297"></A>and not subject? and why have you come to the philosophers? was it that 
<A NAME="298"></A>you may nevertheless be unfortunate and unhappy? You will then in this 
<A NAME="299"></A>way, as I have supposed you to have done, be without fear and disturbance. 
<A NAME="300"></A>And what is grief to you? for fear comes from what you expect, but grief 
<A NAME="301"></A>from that which is present. But what further will you desire? For of the 
<A NAME="302"></A>things which are within the power of the will, as being good and present, 
<A NAME="303"></A>you have a proper and regulated desire: but of the things which are not 
<A NAME="304"></A>in the power of the will you do not desire any one, and so you do not allow 
<A NAME="305"></A>any place to that which is irrational, and impatient, and above measure 
<A NAME="306"></A>hasty.
<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR>When, then, you are thus affected toward things, what man can any 
<A NAME="308"></A>longer be formidable to you? For what has a man which is formidable to 
<A NAME="309"></A>another, either when you see him or speak to him or, finally, are conversant 
<A NAME="310"></A>with him? Not more than one horse has with respect to another, or one dog 
<A NAME="311"></A>to another, or one bee to another bee. Things, indeed, are formidable to 
<A NAME="312"></A>every man; and when any man is able to confer these things on another or 
<A NAME="313"></A>to take them away, then he too becomes formidable. How then is an acropolis 
<A NAME="314"></A>demolished? Not by the sword, not by fire, but by opinion. For if we abolish 
<A NAME="315"></A>the acropolis which is in the city, can we abolish also that of fever, 
<A NAME="316"></A>and that of beautiful women? Can we, in a word, abolish the acropolis which 
<A NAME="317"></A>is in us and cast out the tyrants within us, whom we have dally over us, 
<A NAME="318"></A>sometimes the same tyrants, at other times different tyrants? But with 
<A NAME="319"></A>this we must begin, and with this we must demolish the acropolis and eject 
<A NAME="320"></A>the tyrants, by giving up the body, the parts of it, the faculties of it, 
<A NAME="321"></A>the possessions, the reputation, magisterial offices, honours, children, 
<A NAME="322"></A>brothers, friends, by considering all these things as belonging to others. 
<A NAME="323"></A>And if tyrants have been ejected from us, why do I still shut in the acropolis 
<A NAME="324"></A>by a wall of circumvallation, at least on my account; for if it still stands, 
<A NAME="325"></A>what does it do to me? why do I still eject guards? For where do I perceive 
<A NAME="326"></A>them? against others they have their fasces, and their spears, and their 
<A NAME="327"></A>swords. But I have never been hindered in my will, nor compelled when I 
<A NAME="328"></A>did not will. And how is this possible? I have placed my movements toward 
<A NAME="329"></A>action in obedience to God. Is it His will that I shall have fever? It 
<A NAME="330"></A>is my will also. Is it His will that I should move toward anything? It 
<A NAME="331"></A>is my will also. Is it His will that I should obtain anything? It is my 
<A NAME="332"></A>wish also. Does He not will? I do not wish. Is it His will that I be put 
<A NAME="333"></A>to the rack? It is my will then to die; it is my will then to be put to 
<A NAME="334"></A>the rack. Who, then, is still able to hinder me contrary to my own judgement, 
<A NAME="335"></A>or to compel me? No more than he can hinder or compel 
<A NAME="336"></A>Zeus.
<A NAME="337"></A><BR><BR>Thus the more cautious of travelers also act. A traveler has heard 
<A NAME="338"></A>that the road is infested by robbers; he does not venture to enter on it 
<A NAME="339"></A>alone, but he waits for the companionship on the road either of an ambassador, 
<A NAME="340"></A>or of a quaestor, or of a proconsul, and when he has attached himself to 
<A NAME="341"></A>such persons he goes along the road safely. So in the world the wise man 
<A NAME="342"></A>acts. There are many companies of robbers, tyrants, storms, difficulties, 
<A NAME="343"></A>losses of that which is dearest. "Where is there any place of refuge? how 
<A NAME="344"></A>shall he pass along without being attacked by robbers? what company shall 
<A NAME="345"></A>he wait for that he may pass along in safety? to whom shall he attach himself? 
<A NAME="346"></A>To what person generally? to the rich man, to the man of consular rank? 
<A NAME="347"></A>and what is the use of that to me? Such a man is stripped himself, groans 
<A NAME="348"></A>and laments. But what if the fellow-companion himself turns against me 
<A NAME="349"></A>and becomes my robber, what shall I do? I will be 'a friend of Caesar': 
<A NAME="350"></A>when I am Caesar's companion no man will wrong me. In the first place, 
<A NAME="351"></A>that I may become illustrious, what things must I endure and suffer? how 
<A NAME="352"></A>often and by how many must I he robbed? Then, if I become Caesar's friend, 
<A NAME="353"></A>he also is mortal. And if Caesar from any circumstance becomes my enemy, 
<A NAME="354"></A>where is it best for me to retire? Into a desert? Well, does fever not 
<A NAME="355"></A>come there? What shall be done then? Is it not possible to find a safe 
<A NAME="356"></A>fellow traveler, a faithful one, strong, secure against all surprises?" 
<A NAME="357"></A>Thus he considers and perceives that if he attaches himself to God, he 
<A NAME="358"></A>will make his journey in safety.
<A NAME="359"></A><BR><BR>"How do you understand 'attaching yourself to God'?" In this sense, 
<A NAME="360"></A>that whatever God wills, a man also shall will; and what God does not will, 
<A NAME="361"></A>a man shall not will. How, then, shall this he done? In what other way 
<A NAME="362"></A>than by examining the movements of God and his administration What has 
<A NAME="363"></A>He given to me as my own and in my own power? what has He reserved to Himself? 
<A NAME="364"></A>He has given to me the things which are in the power of the will: He has 
<A NAME="365"></A>put them in my power free from impediment and hindrance. How was He able 
<A NAME="366"></A>to make the earthly body free from hindrance? And accordingly He has subjected 
<A NAME="367"></A>to the revolution of the whole, possessions, household things, house, children, 
<A NAME="368"></A>wife. Why, then, do I fight against God? why do I will what does not depend 
<A NAME="369"></A>on the will? why do I will to have absolutely what is not granted to ma? 
<A NAME="370"></A>But how ought I to will to have things? In the way in which they are given 
<A NAME="371"></A>and as long as they are given. But He who has given takes away. Why then 
<A NAME="372"></A>do I resist? I do not say that I shall be fool if I use force to one who 
<A NAME="373"></A>is stronger, but I shall first be unjust. For whence had I things when 
<A NAME="374"></A>I came into the world? My father gave them to me. And who gave them to 
<A NAME="375"></A>him? and who made the sun? and who made the fruits of the earth? and who 
<A NAME="376"></A>the seasons? and who made the connection of men with one another and their 
<A NAME="377"></A>fellowship?
<A NAME="378"></A><BR><BR>Then after receiving everything from another and even yourself, 
<A NAME="379"></A>are you angry and do you blame the Giver if he takes anything from you? 
<A NAME="380"></A>Who are you, and for what purpose did you come into the world? Did not 
<A NAME="381"></A>He introduce you here, did He not show you the light, did he not give you 
<A NAME="382"></A>fellow-workers, and perception, and reason? and as whom did He introduce 
<A NAME="383"></A>you here? did He not introduce you as a subject to death, and as one to 
<A NAME="384"></A>live on the earth with a little flesh, and to observe His administration, 
<A NAME="385"></A>and to join with Him in the spectacle and the festival for a short time? 
<A NAME="386"></A>Will you not, then, as long as you have been permitted, after seeing the 
<A NAME="387"></A>spectacle and the solemnity, when he leads you out, go with adoration of 
<A NAME="388"></A>Him and thanks for what you have seen, and heard? "No; but I would, still 
<A NAME="389"></A>enjoy the feast." The initiated, too, would wish to be longer in the initiation: 
<A NAME="390"></A>and perhaps also those, at Olympia to see other athletes; but the solemnity 
<A NAME="391"></A>is ended: go away like a grateful and modest man; make room for others: 
<A NAME="392"></A>others also must be born, as you were, and being born they must have a 
<A NAME="393"></A>place, and houses and necessary things. And if the first do not retire, 
<A NAME="394"></A>what remains? Why ire you insatiable? Why are you not content? why do you 
<A NAME="395"></A>contract the world? "Yes, but I would have my little children with me and 
<A NAME="396"></A>my wife." What, are they yours? do they not belong to the Giver, and to 
<A NAME="397"></A>Him who made you? then will you not give up what belongs to others? will 
<A NAME="398"></A>you not give way to Him who is superior? "Why, then, did He introduce me 
<A NAME="399"></A>into the world on these conditions," And if the conditions do not suit 
<A NAME="400"></A>you depart. He has no need of a spectator who is not satisfied. He wants 
<A NAME="401"></A>those who join in the festival, those who take part in the chorus, that 
<A NAME="402"></A>they may rather applaud, admire, and celebrate with hymns the solemnity. 
<A NAME="403"></A>But those who can bear no trouble, and the cowardly He will not willingly 
<A NAME="404"></A>see absent from the great assembly; for they did not when they were present 
<A NAME="405"></A>behave as they ought to do at a festival nor fill up their place properly, 
<A NAME="406"></A>but they lamented, found fault with the deity, fortune, their companions; 
<A NAME="407"></A>not seeing both what they had. and their own powers, which they received 
<A NAME="408"></A>for contrary purposes, the powers of magnanimity, of a generous mind, manly 
<A NAME="409"></A>spirit, and what we are now inquiring about, freedom. "For what purpose, 
<A NAME="410"></A>then, have I received these things? To use them. "How long;" So long as 
<A NAME="411"></A>He who his lent them chooses. "What if they are necessary to me?" Do not 
<A NAME="412"></A>attach yourself to them and they will not be necessary: do not say to yourself 
<A NAME="413"></A>that they are necessary, and then they are not necessary.
<A NAME="414"></A><BR><BR>This study you ought to practice from morning to evening, beginning, 
<A NAME="415"></A>with the smallest things and those most liable to damage, with an earthen 
<A NAME="416"></A>pot, with a cup. Then proceed in this way to a tunic to a little dog, to 
<A NAME="417"></A>a horse, to a small estate in land: then to yourself, to your body, to 
<A NAME="418"></A>the parts of your body, to your brothers. Look all round and throw these 
<A NAME="419"></A>things from you. Purge your opinions so that nothing cleave to you of the 
<A NAME="420"></A>things which are not your own, that nothing grow to you, that nothing give 
<A NAME="421"></A>you pain when it is torn from you; and say, while you are daily exercising 
<A NAME="422"></A>yourself as you do there, not that you are philosophizing, for this is 
<A NAME="423"></A>an arrogant expression, but that you are presenting an asserter of freedom: 
<A NAME="424"></A>for this is really freedom. To this freedom Diogenes was called by Antisthenes, 
<A NAME="425"></A>and he said that he could no longer be enslaved by any man. For this reason 
<A NAME="426"></A>when he was taken prisoner, how did he behave to the pirates? Did he call 
<A NAME="427"></A>any of them master? and I do not speak of the name, for I am not afraid 
<A NAME="428"></A>of the word, but of the state of mind by which the word is produced. How 
<A NAME="429"></A>did he reprove them for feeding badly their captives? How was he sold? 
<A NAME="430"></A>Did he seek a master? no; but a slave, And, when he was sold, how did he 
<A NAME="431"></A>behave to his master? Immediately he disputed with him and said to his 
<A NAME="432"></A>master that he ought not to be dressed as he was, nor shaved in such a 
<A NAME="433"></A>manner; and about the children he told them how he ought to bring them 
<A NAME="434"></A>up. And what was strange in this? for if his master had bought an exercise 
<A NAME="435"></A>master, would he have employed him in the exercises of the palaestra as 
<A NAME="436"></A>a servant or as a master? and so if he had bought a physician or an architect. 
<A NAME="437"></A>And so, in every matter, it is absolutely necessary that he who has skill 
<A NAME="438"></A>must be the superior of him who has not. Whoever, then, generally possesses 
<A NAME="439"></A>the science of life, what else must he be than master? For who is master 
<A NAME="440"></A>of a ship? "The man who governs the helm." Why? Because he who will not 
<A NAME="441"></A>obey him suffers for it. "But a master can give me stripes." Can he do 
<A NAME="442"></A>it, then, without suffering for it?' "So I also used to think." But because 
<A NAME="443"></A>he can not do it without suffering for it, for this reason it is not in 
<A NAME="444"></A>his power: and no man can do what is unjust without suffering for it. "And 
<A NAME="445"></A>what is the penalty for him who puts his own slave in chains, what do you 
<A NAME="446"></A>think that is?" The fact of putting the slave in chains: and you also will 
<A NAME="447"></A>admit this, if you choose to maintain the truth, that man is not a wild 
<A NAME="448"></A>beast, but a tame animal. For when is a a vine doing badly? When it is 
<A NAME="449"></A>in a condition contrary to its nature. When is a cock? Just the same. Therefore 
<A NAME="450"></A>a man also is so. What then is a man's nature? To bite, to kick, and to 
<A NAME="451"></A>throw into prison and to behead? No; but to do good, to co-operate with 
<A NAME="452"></A>others, to wish them well. At that time, then, he is in a bad condition, 
<A NAME="453"></A>whether you choose to admit it or not, when he is acting 
<A NAME="454"></A>foolishly.
<A NAME="455"></A><BR><BR>"Socrates, then, did not fare badly?" No; but his judges aid his 
<A NAME="456"></A>accusers did. "Nor did Helvidius at Rome fare badly?" No; but his murderer 
<A NAME="457"></A>did. "How do you mean?" The same as you do when you say that a cock has 
<A NAME="458"></A>not fared badly when he has gained the victory and been severely wounded; 
<A NAME="459"></A>but that the cock has fared badly when he has been defeated and is unhurt: 
<A NAME="460"></A>nor do you call a dog fortunate who neither pursues game nor labors, but 
<A NAME="461"></A>when you see him sweating, when you see him in pain and panting violently 
<A NAME="462"></A>after running. What paradox do we utter if we say that the evil in everything's 
<A NAME="463"></A>that which is contrary to the nature of the thing? Is that a paradox? for 
<A NAME="464"></A>do you not say this in the case of all other things? Why then in the case 
<A NAME="465"></A>of man only do you think differently, But because we say that the nature 
<A NAME="466"></A>of man is tame and social and faithful, you will not say that this is a 
<A NAME="467"></A>paradox? "It is not." What then is it a paradox to say that a man is not 
<A NAME="468"></A>hurt when he is whipped, or put in chains, or beheaded? does he not, if 
<A NAME="469"></A>he suffers nobly, come off even with increased advantage and profit? But 
<A NAME="470"></A>is he not hurt, who suffers in a most pitiful and disgraceful way, who 
<A NAME="471"></A>in place of a man becomes a wolf, or viper or wasp?
<A NAME="472"></A><BR><BR>Well then let us recapitulate the things which have been agreed 
<A NAME="473"></A>on. The man who is not under restraint is free, to whom things are exactly 
<A NAME="474"></A>in that state in which he wishes them to be; but he who can be restrained 
<A NAME="475"></A>or compelled or hindered, or thrown into any circumstances against his 
<A NAME="476"></A>will, is a slave. But who is free from restraint? He who desires nothing 
<A NAME="477"></A>that belongs to others. And what are the things which belong to others? 
<A NAME="478"></A>Those which are not in our power either to have or not to have, or to have 
<A NAME="479"></A>of a certain kind or in a certain manner. Therefore the body belongs to 
<A NAME="480"></A>another, the parts of the body belong to another, possession belongs to 
<A NAME="481"></A>another. If, then, you are attached to any of these things as your own, 
<A NAME="482"></A>you will pay the penalty which it is proper for him to pay who desires 
<A NAME="483"></A>what belongs to another. This road leads to freedom, that is the only way 
<A NAME="484"></A>of escaping from slavery, to be able to say at last with all your 
<A NAME="485"></A>soul
<A NAME="486"></A><BR><BR><B>Lead me, O Zeus, and thou O destiny,</B> <B>The way that I am 
<A NAME="487"></A>bid by you to go.</B> But what do you say, philosopher? The tyrant summons 
<A NAME="488"></A>you to say something which does not become you. Do you say it or do you 
<A NAME="489"></A>not? Answer me. "Let me consider." Will you consider now? But when you 
<A NAME="490"></A>were in the school, what was it which you used to consider? Did you not 
<A NAME="491"></A>study what are the things that are good and what are bad, and what things 
<A NAME="492"></A>are neither one nor the other? "I did." What then was our opinion? "That 
<A NAME="493"></A>just and honourable acts were good; and that unjust and disgraceful acts 
<A NAME="494"></A>were bad." Is life a good thing? "No." Is death a bad thing? "No." Is prison? 
<A NAME="495"></A>"No." But what did we think about mean and faithless words and betrayal 
<A NAME="496"></A>of a friend and flattery of a tyrant? "That they are bad." Well then, you 
<A NAME="497"></A>are not considering, nor have you considered nor deliberated. For what 
<A NAME="498"></A>is the matter for consideration: is it whether it is becoming for me, when 
<A NAME="499"></A>I have it in my power, to secure for myself the greatest of good things, 
<A NAME="500"></A>and not to secure for myself the greatest evils? A fine inquiry indeed, 
<A NAME="501"></A>and necessary, and one that demands much deliberation. Man, why do you 
<A NAME="502"></A>mock us? Such an inquiry is never made. If you really imagined that base 
<A NAME="503"></A>things were bad and honourable things were good, and that all other things 
<A NAME="504"></A>were neither good nor bad, you would not even have approached this inquiry, 
<A NAME="505"></A>nor have come near it; but immediately you would have been able to distinguish 
<A NAME="506"></A>them by the understanding as you would do by the vision. For when do you 
<A NAME="507"></A>inquire if black things are white, if heavy things are light, and do not 
<A NAME="508"></A>comprehend the manifest evidence of the senses? How, then, do you now say 
<A NAME="509"></A>that you are considering whether things which are neither good nor bad 
<A NAME="510"></A>ought to be avoided more than things which are bad? But you do not possess 
<A NAME="511"></A>these opinions; and neither do these things seem to you to he neither good 
<A NAME="512"></A>nor bad, but you think that they are the greatest evils; nor do you think 
<A NAME="513"></A>those other things to be evils, but matters which do not concern us at 
<A NAME="514"></A>all. For thus from the beginning you have accustomed yourself. "Where am 
<A NAME="515"></A>I? In the schools: and are any listening to me? I am discoursing among 
<A NAME="516"></A>philosophers. But I have gone out of the school. Away with this talk of 
<A NAME="517"></A>scholars and fools." Thus a friend is overpowered by the testimony of a 
<A NAME="518"></A>philosopher: thus a philosopher becomes a parasite; thus he lets himself 
<A NAME="519"></A>for hire for money: thus in the senate a man does not say what he thinks; 
<A NAME="520"></A>in private he proclaims his opinions. You are a cold and miserable little 
<A NAME="521"></A>opinion, suspended from idle words as from a hair. But keep yourself strong 
<A NAME="522"></A>and fit for the uses of life and initiated by being exercised in action. 
<A NAME="523"></A>How do you hear? I do not say that your child is dead- for how could you 
<A NAME="524"></A>bear that?- but that your oil is spilled, your wine drunk up. Do you act 
<A NAME="525"></A>in such a way that one standing by you while you are making a great noise, 
<A NAME="526"></A>may say this only, "Philosopher, you say something different in the school. 
<A NAME="527"></A>Why do you deceive us? Why, when you are only a worm, do you say that you 
<A NAME="528"></A>are a man?" I should like to be present when one of the philosophers is 
<A NAME="529"></A>lying with a woman, that I might see how he is exerting himself, and what 
<A NAME="530"></A>words he is uttering, and whether he remembers his title of philosopher, 
<A NAME="531"></A>and the words which he hears or says or reads.
<A NAME="532"></A><BR><BR>"And what is this to liberty?" Nothing else than this, whether 
<A NAME="533"></A>you who are rich choose or not. "And who is your evidence for this?" who 
<A NAME="534"></A>else than yourselves? who have a powerful master, and who live in obedience 
<A NAME="535"></A>to his nod and motion, and who faint if he only looks at you with a scowling 
<A NAME="536"></A>countenance; you who court old women and old men, and say, "I cannot do 
<A NAME="537"></A>this: it is not in my power." Why is it not in your power? Did you not 
<A NAME="538"></A>lately contend with me and say that you are free "But Aprulla has hindered 
<A NAME="539"></A>me." Tell the truth, then, slave, and do not run away from your masters, 
<A NAME="540"></A>nor deny, nor venture to produce any one to assert your freedom, when you 
<A NAME="541"></A>have so many evidences of your slavery. And indeed when a man is compelled 
<A NAME="542"></A>by love to do something contrary to his opinion, and at the same time sees 
<A NAME="543"></A>the better but has not the strength to follow it, one might consider him 
<A NAME="544"></A>still more worthy of excuse as being held by a certain violent and, in 
<A NAME="545"></A>a manner, a divine power. But who could endure you who are in love with 
<A NAME="546"></A>old women and old men, and wipe the old women's noses, and wash them and 
<A NAME="547"></A>give them presents, and also wait on them like a slave when they are sick, 
<A NAME="548"></A>and at the same time wish them dead, and question the physicians whether 
<A NAME="549"></A>they are sick unto death? And again, when in order to obtain these great 
<A NAME="550"></A>and much admired magistracies and honours, you kiss the hands of these 
<A NAME="551"></A>slaves of others, and so you are not the slave even of free men. Then you 
<A NAME="552"></A>walk about before me in stately fashion, praetor or a consul. Do I not 
<A NAME="553"></A>know how you became a praetor, by what means you got your consulship, who 
<A NAME="554"></A>gave it to you? I would not even choose to live, if I must live by help 
<A NAME="555"></A>of Felicion and endure his arrogance and servile insolence: for I know 
<A NAME="556"></A>what a slave is, who is fortunate, as he thinks, and puffed up by 
<A NAME="557"></A>pride.
<A NAME="558"></A><BR><BR>"You then," a man may say, "are you free?" I wish, by the Gods, 
<A NAME="559"></A>and pray to be free; but I am not yet able to face my masters, I still 
<A NAME="560"></A>value my poor body, I value greatly the preservation of it entire, though 
<A NAME="561"></A>I do not possess it entire. But I can point out to you a free man, that 
<A NAME="562"></A>you may no longer seek an example. Diogenes was free. How was he free?- 
<A NAME="563"></A>not because he was born of free parents, but because he was himself free, 
<A NAME="564"></A>because he had cast off all the handles of slavery, and it was not possible 
<A NAME="565"></A>for any man to approach him, nor had any man the means of laying hold of 
<A NAME="566"></A>him to enslave him. He had everything easily loosed, everything only hanging 
<A NAME="567"></A>to him. If you laid hold of his property, he would rather have let it go 
<A NAME="568"></A>and be yours than he would have followed you for it: if you had laid hold 
<A NAME="569"></A>of his leg, he would have let go his leg; if of all his body, all his poor 
<A NAME="570"></A>body; his intimates, friends, country, just the same. For he knew from 
<A NAME="571"></A>whence he had them, and from whom, and on what conditions. His true parents 
<A NAME="572"></A>indeed, the Gods, and his real country he would never have deserted, nor 
<A NAME="573"></A>would he have yielded to any man in obedience to them or to their orders, 
<A NAME="574"></A>nor would any man have died for his country more readily. For he was not 
<A NAME="575"></A>used to inquire when he should be considered to have done anything on behalf 
<A NAME="576"></A>of the whole of things, but he remembered that everything which is done 
<A NAME="577"></A>comes from thence and is done on behalf of that country and is commanded 
<A NAME="578"></A>by him who administers it. Therefore see what Diogenes himself says and 
<A NAME="579"></A>writes: "For this reason," he says, "Diogenes, it is in your power to speak 
<A NAME="580"></A>both with the King of the Persians and with Archidamus the king of the 
<A NAME="581"></A>Lacedaemonians, as you please." Was it because he was born of free parents? 
<A NAME="582"></A>I suppose all the Athenians and all the Lacedaemonians, because they were 
<A NAME="583"></A>born of slaves, could not talk with them as they wished, but feared and 
<A NAME="584"></A>paid court to them. Why then does he say that it is in his power? "Because 
<A NAME="585"></A>I do not consider the poor body to be my own, because I want nothing, because 
<A NAME="586"></A>law is everything to me, and nothing else is." These were the things which 
<A NAME="587"></A>permitted him to be free.
<A NAME="588"></A><BR><BR>And that you may not think that I show you the example of a man 
<A NAME="589"></A>who is a solitary person, who has neither wife nor children, nor country, 
<A NAME="590"></A>nor friends nor kinsmen, by whom he could be bent and drawn in various 
<A NAME="591"></A>directions, take Socrates and observe that he had a wife and children, 
<A NAME="592"></A>but he did not consider them as his own; that he had a country, so long 
<A NAME="593"></A>as it was fit to have one, and in such a manner as was fit; friends and 
<A NAME="594"></A>kinsmen also, but he held all in subjection to law and to the obedience 
<A NAME="595"></A>due to it. For this reason he was the first to go out as a soldier, when 
<A NAME="596"></A>it was necessary; and in war he exposed himself to danger most unsparingly, 
<A NAME="597"></A>and when he was sent by the tyrants to seize Leon, he did not even deliberate 
<A NAME="598"></A>about the matter, because he thought that it was a base action, and he 
<A NAME="599"></A>knew that he must die, if it so happened. And what difference did that 
<A NAME="600"></A>make to him? for he intended to preserve something else, not his poor flesh, 
<A NAME="601"></A>but his fidelity, his honourable character. These are things which could 
<A NAME="602"></A>not be assailed nor brought into subjection. Then, when he was obliged 
<A NAME="603"></A>to speak in defense of his life, did he behave like a man who had children, 
<A NAME="604"></A>who had a wife? No, but he behaved like a man who has neither. And what 
<A NAME="605"></A>did he do when he was to drink the poison, and when he had the power of 
<A NAME="606"></A>escaping from prison, and when Crito said to him, "Escape for the sake 
<A NAME="607"></A>of your children," what did Socrates say? Did he consider the power of 
<A NAME="608"></A>escape as an unexpected gain? By no means: he considered what was fit and 
<A NAME="609"></A>proper; but the rest he did not even look at or take into the reckoning. 
<A NAME="610"></A>For he did not choose, he said, to save his poor body, but to save that 
<A NAME="611"></A>which is increased and saved by doing what is just, and is impaired and 
<A NAME="612"></A>destroyed by doing what is unjust. Socrates will not save his life by a 
<A NAME="613"></A>base act; he who would not put the Athenians to the vote when they clamoured 
<A NAME="614"></A>that he should do so, he who refused to obey the tyrants, he who discoursed 
<A NAME="615"></A>in such a manner about virtue and right behavior. It is not possible to 
<A NAME="616"></A>save such a man's life by base acts, but he is saved by dying, not by running 
<A NAME="617"></A>away. For the good actor also preserves his character by stopping when 
<A NAME="618"></A>he ought to stop, better than when he goes on acting beyond the proper 
<A NAME="619"></A>time. What then shall the children of Socrates do? "If," said Socrates, 
<A NAME="620"></A>"I had gone off to Thessaly, would you have taken care of them; and if 
<A NAME="621"></A>I depart to the world below, will there be no man to take care of them?" 
<A NAME="622"></A>See how he gives to death a gentle name and mocks it. But if you and I 
<A NAME="623"></A>had been in his place, we should have immediately answered as philosophers 
<A NAME="624"></A>that those who act unjustly must be repaid in the same way, and we should 
<A NAME="625"></A>have added, "I shall be useful to many, if my life is saved, and if I die, 
<A NAME="626"></A>I shall be useful to no man." For, if it had been necessary, we should 
<A NAME="627"></A>have made our escape by slipping through a small hole. And how in that 
<A NAME="628"></A>case should we have been useful to any man? for where would they have been 
<A NAME="629"></A>then staying? or if we were useful to men while we were alive, should we 
<A NAME="630"></A>not have been much more useful to them by dying when we ought to die, and 
<A NAME="631"></A>as we ought? And now, Socrates being dead, no less useful to men, and even 
<A NAME="632"></A>more useful, is the remembrance of that which he did or said when he was 
<A NAME="633"></A>alive.
<A NAME="634"></A><BR><BR>Think of these things, these opinions, these words: look to these 
<A NAME="635"></A>examples, if you would be free, if you desire the thing according to its 
<A NAME="636"></A>worth. And what is the wonder if you buy so great a thing at the price 
<A NAME="637"></A>of things so many and so great? For the sake of this which is called "liberty," 
<A NAME="638"></A>some hang themselves, others throw themselves down precipices, and sometimes 
<A NAME="639"></A>even whole cities have perished: and will you not for the sake of the true 
<A NAME="640"></A>and unassailable and secure liberty give back to God when He demands them 
<A NAME="641"></A>the things which He has given? Will you not, as Plato says, study not to 
<A NAME="642"></A>die only, but also to endure torture, and exile, and scourging, and, in 
<A NAME="643"></A>a word, to give up all which is not your own? If you will not, you will 
<A NAME="644"></A>be a slave among slaves, even you be ten thousand times a consul; and if 
<A NAME="645"></A>you make your way up to the Palace, you will no less be a slave; and you 
<A NAME="646"></A>will feel, that perhaps philosophers utter words which are contrary to 
<A NAME="647"></A>common opinion, as Cleanthes also said, but not words contrary to reason. 
<A NAME="648"></A>For you will know by experience that the words are true, and that there 
<A NAME="649"></A>is no profit from the things which are valued and eagerly sought to those 
<A NAME="650"></A>who have obtained them; and to those who have not yet obtained them there 
<A NAME="651"></A>is an imagination that when these things are come, all that is good will 
<A NAME="652"></A>come with them; then, when they are come, the feverish feeling is the same, 
<A NAME="653"></A>the tossing to and fro is the same, the satiety, the desire of things which 
<A NAME="654"></A>are not present; for freedom is acquired not by the full possession of 
<A NAME="655"></A>the things which are desired, but by removing the desire. And that you 
<A NAME="656"></A>may know that this is true, as you have laboured for those things, so transfer 
<A NAME="657"></A>your labour to these; be vigilant for the purpose of acquiring an opinion 
<A NAME="658"></A>which will make you free; pay court to a philosopher instead of to a rich 
<A NAME="659"></A>old man: be seen about a philosopher's doors: you will not disgrace yourself 
<A NAME="660"></A>by being seen; you will not go away empty nor without profit, if you go 
<A NAME="661"></A>to the philosopher as you ought, and if not, try at least: the trial is 
<A NAME="662"></A>not disgraceful.

<A NAME="663"></A><B>Chapter 2</B>

<A NAME="664"></A><BR><BR>On familiar intimacy
<A NAME="665"></A><BR><BR>To This matter before all you must attend: that you be never so 
<A NAME="666"></A>closely connected with any of your former intimates or friends as to come 
<A NAME="667"></A>down to the same acts as he does. If you do not observe this rule, you 
<A NAME="668"></A>will ruin yourself. But if the thought arises in your mind. "I shall seem 
<A NAME="669"></A>disobliging to him, and he will not have the same feeling toward me," remember 
<A NAME="670"></A>that nothing is done without cost, nor is it possible for a man if he does 
<A NAME="671"></A>not do the same to be the same man that he was. Choose, then, which of 
<A NAME="672"></A>the two you will have, to be equally loved by those by whom you were formerly 
<A NAME="673"></A>loved, being the same with your former self; or, being superior, not to 
<A NAME="674"></A>obtain from your friends the same that you did before. For if this is better, 
<A NAME="675"></A>turn away to it, and let not other considerations draw you in a different 
<A NAME="676"></A>direction. For no man is able to make progress, when he is wavering between 
<A NAME="677"></A>opposite things, but if you have preferred this to all things, if you choose 
<A NAME="678"></A>to attend to this only, to work out this only, give up everything else. 
<A NAME="679"></A>But if you will not do this, your wavering will produce both these results: 
<A NAME="680"></A>you will neither improve as you ought, nor will you obtain what you formerly 
<A NAME="681"></A>obtained. For before, by plainly desiring the things which were worth nothing, 
<A NAME="682"></A>you pleased your associates. But you cannot excel in both kinds, and it 
<A NAME="683"></A>is necessary that so far as you share in the one, you must fall short in 
<A NAME="684"></A>the other. You cannot, when you do not drink with those with whom you used 
<A NAME="685"></A>to drink, he agreeable to them as you were before. Choose, then, whether 
<A NAME="686"></A>you will be a hard drinker and pleasant to your former associates or a 
<A NAME="687"></A>sober man and disagreeable to them. You cannot, when you do not sing with 
<A NAME="688"></A>those with whom you used to sing, be equally loved by them. Choose, then, 
<A NAME="689"></A>in this matter also which of the two you will have. For if it is better 
<A NAME="690"></A>to be modest and orderly than for a man to say, "He is a jolly fellow," 
<A NAME="691"></A>give up the rest, renounce it, turn away from it, have nothing to do with 
<A NAME="692"></A>such men. But if this behavior shall not please you, turn altogether to 
<A NAME="693"></A>the opposite: become a catamite, an adulterer, and act accordingly, and 
<A NAME="694"></A>you will get what you wish. And jump up in the theatre and bawl out in 
<A NAME="695"></A>praise of the dancer. But characters so different cannot be mingled: you 
<A NAME="696"></A>cannot act both Thersites and Agamemnon. If you intend to be Thersites, 
<A NAME="697"></A>you must be humpbacked and bald: if Agamemnon, you must be tall and handsome, 
<A NAME="698"></A>and love those who are placed in obedience to you.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="699"></A><B>Chapter 3</B>

<A NAME="700"></A><BR><BR>What things we should exchange for other things
<A NAME="701"></A><BR><BR>Keep this thought in readiness, when you lose anything external, 
<A NAME="702"></A>what you acquire in place of it; and if it be worth more, never say, "I 
<A NAME="703"></A>have had a loss"; neither if you have got a horse in place of an ass, or 
<A NAME="704"></A>an ox in place of a sheep, nor a good action in place of a bit of money, 
<A NAME="705"></A>nor in place of idle talk such tranquillity as befits a man, nor in place 
<A NAME="706"></A>of lewd talk if you have acquired modesty. If you remember this, you will 
<A NAME="707"></A>always maintain your character such as it ought to be. But if you do not, 
<A NAME="708"></A>consider that the times of opportunity are perishing, and that whatever 
<A NAME="709"></A>pains you take about yourself, you are going to waste them all and overturn 
<A NAME="710"></A>them. And it needs only a few things for the loss and overturning of all, 
<A NAME="711"></A>namely a small deviation from reason. For the steerer of a ship to upset 
<A NAME="712"></A>it, he has no need of the same means as he has need of for saving it: but 
<A NAME="713"></A>if he turns it a little to the wind, it is lost; and if he does not do 
<A NAME="714"></A>this purposely, but has been neglecting his duty a little, the ship is 
<A NAME="715"></A>lost. Something of the kind happens in this case also: if you only fall 
<A NAME="716"></A>to nodding a little, all that you have up to this time collected is gone. 
<A NAME="717"></A>Attend therefore to the appearances of things, and watch over them; for 
<A NAME="718"></A>that which you have to preserve is no small matter, but it is modesty and 
<A NAME="719"></A>fidelity and constancy, freedom from the affects, a state of mind undisturbed, 
<A NAME="720"></A>freedom from fear, tranquillity, in a word, "liberty." For what will you 
<A NAME="721"></A>sell these things? See what is the value of the things which you will obtain 
<A NAME="722"></A>in exchange for these. "But shall I not obtain any such thing for it?" 
<A NAME="723"></A>See, and if you do in return get that, see what you receive in place of 
<A NAME="724"></A>it. "I possess decency, he possesses a tribuneship: be possesses a praetorship, 
<A NAME="725"></A>I possess modesty. But I do not make acclamations where it is not becoming: 
<A NAME="726"></A>I will not stand up where I ought not; for I am free, and a friend of God, 
<A NAME="727"></A>and so I obey Him willingly. But I must not claim anything else, neither 
<A NAME="728"></A>body nor possession, nor magistracy, nor good report, nor in fact anything. 
<A NAME="729"></A>For He does not allow me to claim them: for if He had chosen, He would 
<A NAME="730"></A>have made them good for me; but He has not done so, and for this reason 
<A NAME="731"></A>I cannot transgress his commands." Preserve that which is your own good 
<A NAME="732"></A>in everything; and as to every other thing, as it is permitted, and so 
<A NAME="733"></A>far as to behave consistently with reason in respect to them, content with 
<A NAME="734"></A>this only. If you do not, you will be unfortunate, you will fall in all 
<A NAME="735"></A>things, you will be hindered, you will be impeded. These are the laws which 
<A NAME="736"></A>have been sent from thence; these are the orders. Of these laws a man ought 
<A NAME="737"></A>to be an expositor, to these he ought to submit, not to those of Masurius 
<A NAME="738"></A>and Cassius.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="739"></A><B>Chapter 4</B>

<A NAME="740"></A><BR><BR>To those who are desirous of passing life in 
<A NAME="741"></A>tranquility
<A NAME="742"></A><BR><BR>Remember that not only the desire of power and of riches makes 
<A NAME="743"></A>us mean and subject to others, but even the desire of tranquillity, and 
<A NAME="744"></A>of leisure. and of traveling abroad, and of learning. For, to speak plainly, 
<A NAME="745"></A>whatever the external thing may be, the value which we set upon it places 
<A NAME="746"></A>us in subjection to others. What, then, is the difference between desiring, 
<A NAME="747"></A>to be a senator or not desiring to be one; what is the difference between 
<A NAME="748"></A>desiring power or being content with a private station; what is the difference 
<A NAME="749"></A>between saying, "I am unhappy, I have nothing, to do, but I am bound to 
<A NAME="750"></A>my books as a corpse"; or saying, "I am unhappy, I have no leisure for 
<A NAME="751"></A>reading"? For as salutations and power are things external and independent 
<A NAME="752"></A>of the will, so is a book. For what purpose do you choose to read? Tell 
<A NAME="753"></A>me. For if you only direct your purpose to being amused or learning something, 
<A NAME="754"></A>you are a silly fellow and incapable of enduring labour. But if you refer 
<A NAME="755"></A>reading to the proper end, what else is this than a tranquil and happy 
<A NAME="756"></A>life? But if reading does not secure for you a happy and tranquil life, 
<A NAME="757"></A>what is the use of it? But it does secure this," the man replies, "and 
<A NAME="758"></A>for this reason I am vexed that I am deprived of it." And what is this 
<A NAME="759"></A>tranquil and happy life, which any man can impede; I do not say Caesar 
<A NAME="760"></A>or Caesar's friend, but a crow, a piper, a fever, and thirty thousand other 
<A NAME="761"></A>things? But a tranquil and happy life contains nothing so sure is continuity 
<A NAME="762"></A>and freedom from obstacle. Now I am called to do something: I will go, 
<A NAME="763"></A>then, with the purpose of observing the measures which I must keep, of 
<A NAME="764"></A>acting with modesty, steadiness, without desire and aversion to things 
<A NAME="765"></A>external; and then that I may attend to men, what they say, how they are 
<A NAME="766"></A>moved; and this not with any bad disposition, or that I may have something 
<A NAME="767"></A>to blame or to ridicule; but I turn to myself, and ask if I also commit 
<A NAME="768"></A>the same faults. "How then shall I cease to commit them?" Formerly I also 
<A NAME="769"></A>acted wrong, but now I do not: thanks to God.
<A NAME="770"></A><BR><BR>Come, when you have done these things and have attended to them, 
<A NAME="771"></A>have you done a worse act than when you have read a thousand verses or 
<A NAME="772"></A>written as many? For when you eat, are you grieved because you are not 
<A NAME="773"></A>reading? are you not satisfied with eating according to what you have learned 
<A NAME="774"></A>by reading, and so with bathing and with exercise? Why, then, do you not 
<A NAME="775"></A>act consistently in all things, both when you approach Caesar and when 
<A NAME="776"></A>you approach any person? If you maintain yourself free from perturbation, 
<A NAME="777"></A>free from alarm, and steady; if you look rather at the things which are 
<A NAME="778"></A>done and happen than are looked at yourself; if you do not envy those who 
<A NAME="779"></A>are preferred before you; if surrounding circumstances do not strike you 
<A NAME="780"></A>with fear or admiration, what do you want? Books? How or for what purpose? 
<A NAME="781"></A>for is not this a preparation for life? and is not life itself made up 
<A NAME="782"></A>of certain other things than this? This is just as if an athlete should 
<A NAME="783"></A>weep when he enters the stadium, because he is not being exercised outside 
<A NAME="784"></A>of it. It was for this purpose that you used to practice exercise; for 
<A NAME="785"></A>this purpose were used the halteres, the dust, the young men as antagonists; 
<A NAME="786"></A>and do you seek for those things now when it is the time of action? This 
<A NAME="787"></A>is just as if in the topic of assent when appearances present themselves, 
<A NAME="788"></A>some of which can he comprehended, and some cannot be comprehended, we 
<A NAME="789"></A>should not choose to distinguish them but should choose to read what has 
<A NAME="790"></A>been written about comprehension.
<A NAME="791"></A><BR><BR>What then is the reason of this? The reason is that we have never 
<A NAME="792"></A>read for this purpose, we have never written for this purpose, so that 
<A NAME="793"></A>we may in our actions use in a way conformable to nature the appearances 
<A NAME="794"></A>presented to us; but we terminate in this, in learning what is said, and 
<A NAME="795"></A>in being able to expound it to another, in resolving a syllogism, and in 
<A NAME="796"></A>handling the hypothetical syllogism. For this reason where our study is, 
<A NAME="797"></A>there alone is the impediment. Would you have by all means the things which 
<A NAME="798"></A>are not in your power? Be prevented then, be hindered, fail in your purpose. 
<A NAME="799"></A>But if we read what is written about action, not that we may see what is 
<A NAME="800"></A>said about action, but that we may act well: if we read what is said about 
<A NAME="801"></A>desire and aversion, in order that we may neither fall in our desires, 
<A NAME="802"></A>nor fall into that which we try to avoid: if we read what is said about 
<A NAME="803"></A>duty, in order that, remembering the relations, we may do nothing irrationally 
<A NAME="804"></A>nor contrary to these relations; we should not be vexed in being hindered 
<A NAME="805"></A>as to our readings, but we should be satisfied with doing, the acts which 
<A NAME="806"></A>are conformable, and we should be reckoning not what so far we have been 
<A NAME="807"></A>accustomed to reckon; "To-day I have read so many verses, I have written 
<A NAME="808"></A>so many"; but, "To-day I have employed my action as it is taught by the 
<A NAME="809"></A>philosophers; I have not employed any desire; I have used avoidance only 
<A NAME="810"></A>with respect to things which are within the power of my will; I have not 
<A NAME="811"></A>been afraid of such a person, I have not been prevailed upon by the entreaties 
<A NAME="812"></A>of another; I have exercised my patience, my abstinence my co-operation 
<A NAME="813"></A>with others"; and so we should thank God for what we ought to thank 
<A NAME="814"></A>Him.
<A NAME="815"></A><BR><BR>But now we do not know that we also in another way are like the 
<A NAME="816"></A>many. Another man is afraid that he shall not have power: you are afraid 
<A NAME="817"></A>that you will. Do not do so, my man; but as you ridicule him who is afraid 
<A NAME="818"></A>that he, shall not have power, so ridicule yourself also. For it makes 
<A NAME="819"></A>no difference whether you are thirsty like a man who has a fever, or have 
<A NAME="820"></A>a dread of water like a man who is mad. Or how will you still be able to 
<A NAME="821"></A>say as Socrates did, "If so it pleases God, so let it be"? Do you think 
<A NAME="822"></A>that Socrates, if he had been eager to pass his leisure in the Lyceum or 
<A NAME="823"></A>in the Academy and to discourse dally with the young men, would have readily 
<A NAME="824"></A>served in military expeditions so often as he did; and would he not have 
<A NAME="825"></A>lamented and groaned, "Wretch that I am; I must now be miserable here, 
<A NAME="826"></A>when I might be sunning myself in the Lyceum"? Why, was this your business, 
<A NAME="827"></A>to sun yourself? And is it not your business to be happy, to be free from 
<A NAME="828"></A>hindrance, free from impediment? And could he still have been Socrates, 
<A NAME="829"></A>if he had lamented in this way: how would he still have been able to write 
<A NAME="830"></A>Paeans in his prison?
<A NAME="831"></A><BR><BR>In short, remember this, that what you shall prize which is beyond 
<A NAME="832"></A>your will, so far you have destroyed your will. But these things are out 
<A NAME="833"></A>of the power of the will, not only power, but also a private condition: 
<A NAME="834"></A>not only occupation, but also leisure. "Now, then, must I live in this 
<A NAME="835"></A>tumult?" Why do you say "tumult"? "I mean among many men." Well what is 
<A NAME="836"></A>the hardship? Suppose that you are at Olympia: imagine it to be a panegyris, 
<A NAME="837"></A>where one is calling out one thing, another is doing another thing, and 
<A NAME="838"></A>a third is pushing another person: in the baths there is a crowd: and who 
<A NAME="839"></A>of us is not pleased with this assembly and leaves it unwillingly, Be not 
<A NAME="840"></A>difficult to please nor fastidious about what happens. "Vinegar is disagreeable, 
<A NAME="841"></A>for it is sharp; honey is disagreeable, for it disturbs my habit of body. 
<A NAME="842"></A>I do not like vegetables." So also, "I do not like leisure; it is a desert: 
<A NAME="843"></A>I do not like a crowd; it is confusion." But if circumstances make it necessary 
<A NAME="844"></A>for you to live alone or with a few, call it quiet and use the thing as 
<A NAME="845"></A>you ought: talk with yourself, exercise the appearances, work up your preconceptions. 
<A NAME="846"></A>If you fall into a crowd, call it a celebration of games, a panegyris, 
<A NAME="847"></A>a festival: try to enjoy the festival with other men. For what is a more 
<A NAME="848"></A>pleasant sight to him who loves mankind than a number of men? We see with 
<A NAME="849"></A>pleasure herds of horses or oxen: we are delighted when we see many ships: 
<A NAME="850"></A>who is pained when he sees many men? "But they deafen me with their cries." 
<A NAME="851"></A>Then your hearing is impeded. What, then, is this to you? Is, then, the 
<A NAME="852"></A>power of making use of appearances hindered? And who prevents you from 
<A NAME="853"></A>using, according to nature, inclination to a thing and aversion from it; 
<A NAME="854"></A>and movement toward a thing and movement from it? What tumult is able to 
<A NAME="855"></A>do this?
<A NAME="856"></A><BR><BR>Do you only bear in mind the general rules: "What is mine, what 
<A NAME="857"></A>is not mine; what is given to me; what does God will that I should do now? 
<A NAME="858"></A>what does He not will?" A little before he willed you to be at leisure, 
<A NAME="859"></A>to talk with yourself, to write about these things, to read, to hear, to 
<A NAME="860"></A>prepare yourself. You had sufficient time for this. Now He says to you: 
<A NAME="861"></A>"Come now to the contest; show us what you have learned, how you have practiced 
<A NAME="862"></A>the athletic art. How long will you be exercised alone? Now is the opportunity 
<A NAME="863"></A>for you to learn whether you are an athlete worthy of victory, or one of 
<A NAME="864"></A>those who go about the world and are defeated." Why, then, are; you vexed? 
<A NAME="865"></A>No contest is without confusion. There be many who exercise themselves 
<A NAME="866"></A>for the contests, many who call out to those who exercise themselves, many 
<A NAME="867"></A>masters, many spectators. "But my wish is to live quietly." Lament, then, 
<A NAME="868"></A>and groan as you deserve to do. For what other is a greater punishment 
<A NAME="869"></A>than this to the untaught man and to him who disobeys the divine commands: 
<A NAME="870"></A>to be grieved, to lament, to envy, in a word, to be disappointed and to 
<A NAME="871"></A>he unhappy? Would you not release yourself from these things? "And how 
<A NAME="872"></A>shall I release myself?" Have you not often heard that you ought to remove 
<A NAME="873"></A>entirely desire, apply aversion to those things only which are within your 
<A NAME="874"></A>power, that you ought to give up everything, body, property, fame, books, 
<A NAME="875"></A>tumult, power, private station? for whatever way you turn, you are a slave, 
<A NAME="876"></A>you are subjected, you are hindered, you are compelled, you are entirely 
<A NAME="877"></A>in the power of others. But keep the words of Cleanthes in 
<A NAME="878"></A>readiness,
<A NAME="879"></A><BR><BR><B>Lead me, O Zeus, and thou necessity.</B>
<A NAME="880"></A><BR><BR>Is it your will that I should go to Rome? I will go to Rome. To 
<A NAME="881"></A>Gyara? I will go to Gyara. I will go to Athens? I will go to Athens. To 
<A NAME="882"></A>prison? I will go to prison. If you should once say, "When shall a man 
<A NAME="883"></A>go to Athens?" you are undone. It is a necessary consequence that this 
<A NAME="884"></A>desire, if it is not accomplished, must make you unhappy; and if it is 
<A NAME="885"></A>accomplished, it must make you vain, since you are elated at things at 
<A NAME="886"></A>which you ought not to be elated; and on the other hand, if you are impeded, 
<A NAME="887"></A>it must make you wretched because you fall into that which you would not 
<A NAME="888"></A>fall into. Give up then all these things. "Athens is a good place." But 
<A NAME="889"></A>happiness is much better; and to be free from passions, free from disturbance, 
<A NAME="890"></A>for your affairs not to depend on any man. "There is tumult at Rome and 
<A NAME="891"></A>visits of salutation." But happiness is an equivalent for all troublesome 
<A NAME="892"></A>things. If, then, the time comes for these things, why do you not take 
<A NAME="893"></A>away the wish to avoid them? what necessity is there to carry to avoid 
<A NAME="894"></A>a burden like an ass, and to be beaten with a stick? But if you do not 
<A NAME="895"></A>so, consider that you must always be a slave to him who has it in his power 
<A NAME="896"></A>to effect your release, and also to impede you, and you must serve him 
<A NAME="897"></A>as an evil genius.
<A NAME="898"></A><BR><BR>There is only one way to happiness, and let this rule be ready 
<A NAME="899"></A>both in the morning and during the day and by night; the rule is not to 
<A NAME="900"></A>look toward things which are out of the power of our will, to think that 
<A NAME="901"></A>nothing is our own, to give up all things to the Divinity, to Fortune; 
<A NAME="902"></A>to make them the superintendents of these things, whom Zeus also has made 
<A NAME="903"></A>so; for a man to observe that only which is his own, that which cannot 
<A NAME="904"></A>be hindered; and when we read, to refer our reading to this only, and our 
<A NAME="905"></A>writing and our listening. For this reason, I cannot call the man industrious, 
<A NAME="906"></A>if I hear this only, that he reads and writes; and even if a man adds that 
<A NAME="907"></A>he reads all night, I cannot say so, if he knows not to what he should 
<A NAME="908"></A>refer his reading. For neither do you say that a man is industrious if 
<A NAME="909"></A>he keeps awake for a girl; nor do I. But if he does it for reputation, 
<A NAME="910"></A>I say that he is a lover of reputation. And if he does it for money, I 
<A NAME="911"></A>say that he is a lover of money, not a lover of labour; and if he does 
<A NAME="912"></A>it through love of learning, I say that he is a lover of learning. But 
<A NAME="913"></A>if he refers his labour to his own ruling power, that he may keep it in 
<A NAME="914"></A>a state conformable to nature and pass his life in that state, then only 
<A NAME="915"></A>do I say that he is industrious. For never commend a man on account of 
<A NAME="916"></A>these things which are common to all, but on account of his opinions; for 
<A NAME="917"></A>these are the things which belong to each man, which make his actions bad 
<A NAME="918"></A>or good. Remembering these rules, rejoice in that which is present, and 
<A NAME="919"></A>be content with the things which come in season. If you see anything which 
<A NAME="920"></A>you have learned and inquired about occurring, to you in your course of 
<A NAME="921"></A>life, be delighted at it. If you have laid aside or have lessened bad disposition 
<A NAME="922"></A>and a habit of reviling; if you have done so with rash temper, obscene 
<A NAME="923"></A>words, hastiness, sluggishness; if you are not moved by what you formerly 
<A NAME="924"></A>were, and not in the same way as you once were, you can celebrate a festival 
<A NAME="925"></A>daily, to-day because you have behaved well in one act, and to-morrow because 
<A NAME="926"></A>you have behaved well in another. How much greater is this a reason for 
<A NAME="927"></A>making sacrifices than a consulship or the government of a province? These 
<A NAME="928"></A>things come to you from yourself and from the gods. Remember this, Who 
<A NAME="929"></A>gives these things and to whom, and for what purpose. If you cherish yourself 
<A NAME="930"></A>in these thoughts, do you still think that it makes any difference where 
<A NAME="931"></A>yon shall be happy, where you shall please God? Are not the gods equally 
<A NAME="932"></A>distant from all places? Do they not see from all places alike that which 
<A NAME="933"></A>is going on?

<A NAME="934"></A><B>Chapter 5</B>

<A NAME="935"></A><BR><BR>Against the quarrelsome and ferocious
<A NAME="936"></A><BR><BR>The wise and good man neither himself fights with any person, nor 
<A NAME="937"></A>does he allow another, so far as he can prevent it. And an example of this 
<A NAME="938"></A>as well as of all other things is proposed to us in the life of Socrates, 
<A NAME="939"></A>who not only himself on all occasions avoided fights, but would not allow 
<A NAME="940"></A>even others to quarrel. See in Xenophon's Symposium how many quarrels he 
<A NAME="941"></A>settled; how further he endured Thrasymachus and Polus and Callicles; how 
<A NAME="942"></A>he tolerated his wife, and how he tolerated his son who attempted to confute 
<A NAME="943"></A>him aid to cavil with him. For he remembered well that no man has in his 
<A NAME="944"></A>power another man's ruling principle. He wished, therefore nothing else 
<A NAME="945"></A>than that which was his own. And what is this? Not that this or that man 
<A NAME="946"></A>may act according to nature; for that is a thing which belongs to another; 
<A NAME="947"></A>but that while others are doing their own acts, as they choose, he may 
<A NAME="948"></A>never the less be in a condition conformable to nature and live in it, 
<A NAME="949"></A>only doing what is his own to the end that others also may be in a state 
<A NAME="950"></A>conformable to nature. For this is the object always set before him by 
<A NAME="951"></A>the wise and good man. Is it to be commander of an army? No: but if it 
<A NAME="952"></A>is permitted him, his object is in this matter to maintain his own ruling 
<A NAME="953"></A>principle. Is it to marry? No; but if marriage is allowed to him, in this 
<A NAME="954"></A>matter his object is to maintain himself in a condition conformable to 
<A NAME="955"></A>nature. But if he would have his son not to do wrong, or his wife, he would 
<A NAME="956"></A>have what belongs to another not to belong to another; and to he instructed 
<A NAME="957"></A>is this: to learn what things are a man's own and what belongs to 
<A NAME="958"></A>another.
<A NAME="959"></A><BR><BR>How, then, is there left any place for fighting, to a man who has 
<A NAME="960"></A>this opinion? Is he surprised at anything which happens, and does it appear 
<A NAME="961"></A>new to him? Does he not expect that which comes from the bad to be worse 
<A NAME="962"></A>and more grievous than what actually befalls him? And does he not reckon 
<A NAME="963"></A>as pure gain whatever they may do which falls short of extreme wickedness? 
<A NAME="964"></A>"Such a person has reviled you." Great thanks to him for not having, struck 
<A NAME="965"></A>you. "But he has struck me also." Great thanks that he did not wound you 
<A NAME="966"></A>"But he wounded me also." Great thanks that he did not kill you. For when 
<A NAME="967"></A>did he learn or in what school that man is a tame animal, that men love 
<A NAME="968"></A>one another, that an act of injustice is a great harm to him who does it. 
<A NAME="969"></A>Since then he has not to him who does it. Since then he has not learned 
<A NAME="970"></A>this and is not convinced of it, why shall he not follow that which seems 
<A NAME="971"></A>to be for his own "Your neighbour has thrown stones." Have you then done 
<A NAME="972"></A>anything wrong? "But the things in the house have been broken." Are you 
<A NAME="973"></A>then a utensil? No; but a free power of will. What, then, is given to you 
<A NAME="974"></A>in answer to this? If you are like a wolf, you must bite in return, and 
<A NAME="975"></A>throw more stones. But if you consider what is proper for a man, examine 
<A NAME="976"></A>your store-house, see with at faculties you came into the world. Have you 
<A NAME="977"></A>the disposition of a wild beast, Have you the disposition of revenge for 
<A NAME="978"></A>an injury? When is a horse wretched? When he is deprived of his natural 
<A NAME="979"></A>faculties; not when he cannot crow like a cock, but when he cannot run. 
<A NAME="980"></A>When is a dog wretched? Not when he cannot fly, but when he cannot track 
<A NAME="981"></A>his game. Is, then, a man also unhappy in this way, not because he cannot 
<A NAME="982"></A>strangle lions or embrace statues, for he did not come into the world in 
<A NAME="983"></A>the possession of certain powers from nature for this purpose, but because 
<A NAME="984"></A>he has lost his probity and his fidelity? People ought to meet and lament 
<A NAME="985"></A>such a man for the misfortunes into which he has fallen; not indeed to 
<A NAME="986"></A>lament because a man his been born or has died, but because it has happened 
<A NAME="987"></A>to him in his lifetime to have lost the things which are his own, not that 
<A NAME="988"></A>which he received from his father, not his land and house, and his inn, 
<A NAME="989"></A>and his slaves; for not one of these things is a man's own, but all belong 
<A NAME="990"></A>to others, are servile and subject to account, at different times given 
<A NAME="991"></A>to different persons by those who have them in their power: but I mean 
<A NAME="992"></A>the things which belong to him as a man, the marks in his mind with which 
<A NAME="993"></A>he came into the world, such as we seek also on coins, and if we find them, 
<A NAME="994"></A>we approve of the coins, and if we do not find the marks, we reject them. 
<A NAME="995"></A>What is the stamp on this Sestertius? "The stamp of Trajan." Present it. 
<A NAME="996"></A>"It is the stamp of Nero." Throw it away: it cannot be accepted, it is 
<A NAME="997"></A>counterfeit. So also in this case. What is the stamp of his opinions? "It 
<A NAME="998"></A>is gentleness, a sociable disposition, a tolerant temper, a disposition 
<A NAME="999"></A>to mutual affection." Produce these qualities. I accept them: I consider 
<A NAME="1000"></A>this man a citizen, I accept him as a neighbour, a companion in my voyages. 
<A NAME="1001"></A>Only see that he has not Nero's stamp. Is he passionate, is he full of 
<A NAME="1002"></A>resentment, is he faultfinding? If the whim seizes him, does he break the 
<A NAME="1003"></A>heads of those who come in his way? Why, then did you say that he is a 
<A NAME="1004"></A>man? Is everything judged by the bare form? If that is so, say that the 
<A NAME="1005"></A>form in wax is all apple and has the smell and the taste of an apple. But 
<A NAME="1006"></A>the external figure is not enough: neither then is the nose enough and 
<A NAME="1007"></A>the eyes to make the man, but he must have the opinions of a man. Here 
<A NAME="1008"></A>is a man who does not listen to reason, who does not know when he is refuted: 
<A NAME="1009"></A>he is an ass: in another man the sense of shame is become dead: he is good 
<A NAME="1010"></A>for nothing, he is anything rather than a man. This man seeks whom he may 
<A NAME="1011"></A>meet and kick or bite, so that he is not even a sheep or an ass, but a 
<A NAME="1012"></A>kind of wild beast.
<A NAME="1013"></A><BR><BR>"What then would you have me to be despised?" By whom? by those 
<A NAME="1014"></A>who know you? and how and how shall those who know you despise a man who 
<A NAME="1015"></A>is gentle and modest? Perhaps you mean by those who do not know you? What 
<A NAME="1016"></A>is that to you? For no other artisan cares for the opinion of those who 
<A NAME="1017"></A>know not his art. "But they will be more hostile to me for this reason." 
<A NAME="1018"></A>Why do you say "me"? Can any man injure your will, or prevent you from 
<A NAME="1019"></A>using in a natural way the appearances which are presented to you, "In 
<A NAME="1020"></A>no way can he." Why, then, are still disturbed and why do you choose to 
<A NAME="1021"></A>show yourself afraid? And why do you not come forth and proclaim that you 
<A NAME="1022"></A>are at peace with all men whatever they may do, and laugh at those chiefly 
<A NAME="1023"></A>who think that they can harm you? "These slaves," you can say, "know not 
<A NAME="1024"></A>either who I am nor where lies my good or my evil, because they have no 
<A NAME="1025"></A>access to the things which are mine."
<A NAME="1026"></A><BR><BR>In this way, also, those who occupy a strong city mock the besiegers; 
<A NAME="1027"></A>"What trouble these men are now taking for nothing: our wall is secure, 
<A NAME="1028"></A>we have food for a very long time, and all other resources." These are 
<A NAME="1029"></A>the things which make a city strong and impregnable: but nothing else than 
<A NAME="1030"></A>his opinions makes a man's soul impregnable. For what wall is so strong, 
<A NAME="1031"></A>or what body is so hard, or what possession is so safe, or what honour 
<A NAME="1032"></A>so free from assault? All things everywhere are perishable, easily taken 
<A NAME="1033"></A>by assault, and, if any man in any way is attached to them, he must be 
<A NAME="1034"></A>disturbed, expect what is bad, he must fear, lament, find his desires disappointed, 
<A NAME="1035"></A>and fall into things which he would avoid. Then do we not choose to make 
<A NAME="1036"></A>secure the only means of safety which are offered to us, and do we not 
<A NAME="1037"></A>choose to withdraw ourselves from that which is perishable and servile 
<A NAME="1038"></A>and to labour at the things, which are imperishable and by nature free; 
<A NAME="1039"></A>and do we not remember that no man either hurts another or does good to 
<A NAME="1040"></A>another, but that a man's opinion about each thing is that which hurts 
<A NAME="1041"></A>him, is that which overturns him; this is fighting, this is civil discord, 
<A NAME="1042"></A>this is war? That which made Eteocles and Polynices enemies was nothing 
<A NAME="1043"></A>else than this opinion which they had about royal power, their opinion 
<A NAME="1044"></A>about exile, that the one is the extreme of evils, the other the greatest 
<A NAME="1045"></A>good. Now this is the nature of every man to seek the good, to avoid the 
<A NAME="1046"></A>bad; to consider him who deprives us of the one and involves us in the 
<A NAME="1047"></A>other an enemy and treacherous, even if he be a brother, or a son or a 
<A NAME="1048"></A>father. For nothing is more akin to us than the good: therefore if these 
<A NAME="1049"></A>things are good and evil, neither is a father a friend to sons, nor a brother 
<A NAME="1050"></A>to a brother, but all the world is everywhere full of enemies, treacherous 
<A NAME="1051"></A>men, and sycophants. But if the will, being what it ought to be, is the 
<A NAME="1052"></A>only good; and if the will, being such as it ought not to be, is the only 
<A NAME="1053"></A>evil, where is there any strife, where is there reviling? about what? about 
<A NAME="1054"></A>the things which do not concern us? and strife with whom? with the ignorant, 
<A NAME="1055"></A>the unhappy, with those who are deceived about the chief 
<A NAME="1056"></A>things?
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR><BR>Remembering this Socrates managed his own house and endured a very 
<A NAME="1058"></A>ill-tempered wife and a foolish son. For in what did she show her bad temper? 
<A NAME="1059"></A>In pouring water on his head as much as she liked, and in trampling on 
<A NAME="1060"></A>the cake. And what is this to me, if I think that these things are nothing 
<A NAME="1061"></A>to me? But this is my business; and neither tyrant shall check my will 
<A NAME="1062"></A>nor a master; nor shall the many check me who am only one, nor shall the 
<A NAME="1063"></A>stronger check me who am the weaker; for this power of being free from 
<A NAME="1064"></A>check is given by God to every man. For these opinions make love in a house, 
<A NAME="1065"></A>concord in a state, among nations peace, and gratitude to God; they make 
<A NAME="1066"></A>a man in all things cheerful in externals as about things which belong 
<A NAME="1067"></A>to others, as about things which are of no value. We indeed are able to 
<A NAME="1068"></A>write and to read these things, and to praise them when they are read, 
<A NAME="1069"></A>but we do not even come near to being convinced of them. Therefore what 
<A NAME="1070"></A>is said of the Lacedaemonians, "Lions at home, but in Ephesus foxes," will 
<A NAME="1071"></A>fit in our case also, "Lions in the school, but out of it 
<A NAME="1072"></A>foxes."

<A NAME="1074"></A><BR><BR>Against those who lament over being pitied
<A NAME="1075"></A><BR><BR>"I am grieved," a man says, "at being pitied." Whether, then, is 
<A NAME="1076"></A>the fact of your being pitied a thing which concerns you or those who pity 
<A NAME="1077"></A>you? Well, is it in your power to stop this pity? "It is in my power, if 
<A NAME="1078"></A>I show them that I do not require pity." And whether, then, are you in 
<A NAME="1079"></A>the condition of not deserving pity, or are you not in that condition? 
<A NAME="1080"></A>"I think I am not: but these persons do not pity me
