<BR><BR>
<A NAME="10"></A><B>Fragment 1</B>

<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>I speak to those who lawfully may hear:
<A NAME="12"></A><BR><BR>Depart all ye profane, and close the doors.
<A NAME="13"></A><BR><BR>The thoughts of a wise theology, wherein men indicated God and 
<A NAME="14"></A>God's powers by images akin to sense, and sketched invisible things in 
<A NAME="15"></A>visible forms, I will show to those who have learned to read from the statues 
<A NAME="16"></A>as from books the things there written concerning the gods. Nor is it any 
<A NAME="17"></A>wonder that the utterly unlearned regard the statues as wood and stone, 
<A NAME="18"></A>just as also those who do not understand the written letters look upon 
<A NAME="19"></A>the monuments as mere stones, and on the tablets as bits of wood, and on 
<A NAME="20"></A>books as woven papyrus.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="21"></A><B>Fragment 2</B>

<A NAME="22"></A><BR><BR>As the deity is of the nature of light, and dwells in an atmosphere 
<A NAME="23"></A>of ethereal fire, and is invisible to sense that is busy about mortal life, 
<A NAME="24"></A>He through translucent matter, as crystal or Parian marble or even ivory, 
<A NAME="25"></A>led men on to the conception of his light, and through material gold to 
<A NAME="26"></A>the discernment of the fire, and to his undefiled purity, because gold 
<A NAME="27"></A>cannot be defiled.
<A NAME="28"></A><BR><BR>On the other hand, black marble was used by many to show his invisibility; 
<A NAME="29"></A>and they moulded their gods in human form because the deity is rational, 
<A NAME="30"></A>and made these beautiful, because in those is pure and perfect beauty; 
<A NAME="31"></A>and in varieties of shape and age, of sitting and standing, and drapery; 
<A NAME="32"></A>and some of them male, and some female, virgins, and youths, or married, 
<A NAME="33"></A>to represent their diversity.
<A NAME="34"></A><BR><BR>Hence they assigned everything white to the gods of heaven, and 
<A NAME="35"></A>the sphere and all things spherical to the cosmos and to the sun and moon 
<A NAME="36"></A>in particular, but sometimes also to fortune and to hope: and the circle 
<A NAME="37"></A>and things circular to eternity, and to the motion of the heaven, and to 
<A NAME="38"></A>the zones and cycles therein; and the segments of circles to the phases 
<A NAME="39"></A>of the moon; pyramids and obelisks to the element of fire, and therefore 
<A NAME="40"></A>to the gods of Olympus; so again the cone to the sun, and cylinder to the 
<A NAME="41"></A>earth, and figures representing parts of the human body to sowing and 
<A NAME="42"></A>generation.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="43"></A><B>Fragment 3</B>

<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR>'Now look at the wisdom of the Greeks, and examine it as follows. 
<A NAME="45"></A>The authors of the Orphic hymns supposed Zeus to be the mind of the world, 
<A NAME="46"></A>and that he created all things therein,containing the world in himself. 
<A NAME="47"></A>Therefore in their theological systems they have handed down their opinions 
<A NAME="48"></A>concerning him thus:'
<A NAME="49"></A><BR><BR>Zeus was the first, Zeus last, the lightning's 
<A NAME="50"></A>lord,
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>Zeus head, Zeus centre, all things are from Zeus.
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>Zeus born a male, Zeus virgin undefiled;
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>Zeus the firm base of earth and starry heaven;
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>Zeus sovereign, Zeus alone first cause of all:
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>One power divine, great ruler of the world,
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>One kingly form, encircling all things here,
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>Fire, water, earth, and ether, night and day;
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>Wisdom, first parent, and delightful Love:
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>For in Zeus' mighty body these all lie.
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>His head and beauteous face the radiant heaven
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>Reveals and round him float in shining waves
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>The golden tresses of the twinkling stars.
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>On either side bulls' horns of gold are seen,
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>Sunrise and sunset, footpaths of the gods.
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>His eyes the Sun, the Moon's responsive light;
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>His mind immortal ether, sovereign truth,
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>Hears and considers all; nor any speech,
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>Nor cry, nor noise, nor ominous voice escapes
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>The ear of Zeus, great Kronos' mightier son:
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>Such his immortal head, and such his thought.
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>His radiant body, boundless, undisturbed
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>In strength of mighty limbs was formed thus:
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>The god's broad-spreading shoulders, breast and 
<A NAME="74"></A>back
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>Air's wide expanse displays; on either side
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>Grow wings, wherewith throughout all space he flies.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>Earth the all-mother, with her lofty hills,
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>His sacred belly forms; the swelling flood
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>Of hoarse resounding Ocean girds his waist.
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>His feet the deeply rooted ground upholds,
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>And dismal Tartarus, and earth's utmost bounds.
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>All things he hides, then from his heart again
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>In godlike action brings to gladsome light.
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><BR>Zeus, therefore, is the whole world, animal of animals, and god 
<A NAME="85"></A>of gods; but Zeus, that is, inasmuch as he is the mind from which he brings 
<A NAME="86"></A>forth all things, and by his thoughts creates them. When the theologians 
<A NAME="87"></A>had explained the nature of god in this manner, to make an image such as 
<A NAME="88"></A>their description indicated was neither possible, nor, if any one thought 
<A NAME="89"></A>of it, could he show the look of life, and intelligence, and forethought 
<A NAME="90"></A>by the figure of a sphere.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR>But they have made the representation of Zeus in human form, because 
<A NAME="92"></A>mind was that according to which he wrought, and by generative laws brought 
<A NAME="93"></A>all things to completion; and he is seated, as indicating the steadfastness 
<A NAME="94"></A>of his power: and his upper parts are bare, because he is manifested in 
<A NAME="95"></A>the intellectual and the heavenly parts of the world; but his feet are 
<A NAME="96"></A>clothed, because he is invisible in the things that lie hidden below. And 
<A NAME="97"></A>he holds his sceptre in his left hand, because most close to that side 
<A NAME="98"></A>of the body dwells the heart, the most commanding and intelligent organ: 
<A NAME="99"></A>for the creative mind is the sovereign of the world. And in his right hand 
<A NAME="100"></A>he holds forth either an eagle, because he is master of the gods who traverse 
<A NAME="101"></A>the air, as the eagle is master of the birds that fly aloft - or a victory, 
<A NAME="102"></A>because he is himself victorious over all things.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="103"></A><B>Fragment 4</B>

<A NAME="104"></A><BR><BR>They have made Hera the wife of Zeus, because they called the ethereal 
<A NAME="105"></A>and aerial power Hera. For the ether is a very subtle 
<A NAME="106"></A>air.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="107"></A><B>Fragment 5</B>

<A NAME="108"></A><BR><BR>And the power of the whole air is Hera, called by a name derived 
<A NAME="109"></A>from the air: but the symbol of the sublunar air which is affected by light 
<A NAME="110"></A>and darkness is Leto; for she is oblivion caused by the insensibility in 
<A NAME="111"></A>sleep, and because souls begotten below the moon are accompanied by forgetfulness 
<A NAME="112"></A>of the Divine; and on this account she is also the mother of Apollo and 
<A NAME="113"></A>Artemis, who are the sources of light for the night.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="114"></A><B>Fragment 6</B>

<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR>The ruling principle of the power of earth is called Hestia, of 
<A NAME="116"></A>whom a statue representing her as a virgin is usually set up on the hearth; 
<A NAME="117"></A>but inasmuch as the power is productive, they symbolize her by the form 
<A NAME="118"></A>of a woman with prominent breasts. The name Rhea they gave to the power 
<A NAME="119"></A>of rocky and mountainous land, and Demeter to that of level and productive 
<A NAME="120"></A>land. Demeter in other respects is the same as Rhea, but differs in the 
<A NAME="121"></A>fact that she gives birth to Kore by Zeus, that is, she produces the shoot 
<A NAME="122"></A>from the seeds of plants. And on this account her statue is crowned with 
<A NAME="123"></A>ears of corn, and poppies are set round her as a symbol of 
<A NAME="124"></A>productiveness.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="125"></A><B>Fragment 7</B>

<A NAME="126"></A><BR><BR>But since there was in the seeds cast into the earth a certain 
<A NAME="127"></A>power, which the sun in passing round to the lower hemisphere drags down 
<A NAME="128"></A>at the time of the winter solstice, Kore is the seminal power, and Pluto 
<A NAME="129"></A>the sun passing under the earth, and traversing the unseen world at the 
<A NAME="130"></A>time of the winter solstice; and he is said to carry off Kore, who, while 
<A NAME="131"></A>hidden beneath the earth, is lamented by her mother 
<A NAME="132"></A>Demeter.
<A NAME="133"></A><BR><BR>The power which produces hard-shelled fruits, and the fruits of 
<A NAME="134"></A>plants in general, is named Dionysus. But observe the images of these also. 
<A NAME="135"></A>For Kore bears symbols of the production of the plants which grow above 
<A NAME="136"></A>the earth in the crops: and Dionysus has horns in common with Kore, and 
<A NAME="137"></A>is of female form, indicating the union of male and female forces in the 
<A NAME="138"></A>generation of the hard shelled fruits.
<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR>But Pluto, the ravisher of Kore, has a helmet as a symbol of the 
<A NAME="140"></A>unseen pole, and his shortened sceptre as an emblem of his kingdom of the 
<A NAME="141"></A>nether world; and his dog indicates the generation of the fruits in its 
<A NAME="142"></A>threefold division - the sowing of the seed, its reception by the earth, 
<A NAME="143"></A>its growing up. For he is called a dog, not because souls are his food, 
<A NAME="144"></A>but because of the earth's fertility, for which Pluto provides when he 
<A NAME="145"></A>carries off Kore.
<A NAME="146"></A><BR><BR>Attis, too, and Adonis are related to the analogy of fruits. Attis 
<A NAME="147"></A>is the symbol of the blossoms which appear early in the spring, and fall 
<A NAME="148"></A>off before the complete fertilization; whence they further attributed castration 
<A NAME="149"></A>to him, from the fruits not having attained to seminal perfection: but 
<A NAME="150"></A>Adonis was the symbol of the cutting of the perfect 
<A NAME="151"></A>fruits.
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR>Silenus was the symbol of the wind's motion, which contributes 
<A NAME="153"></A>no few benefits to the world. And the flowery and brilliant wreath upon 
<A NAME="154"></A>his head is symbolic of the revolution of the heaven, and the hair with 
<A NAME="155"></A>which his lower limbs are surrounded is an indication of the density of 
<A NAME="156"></A>the air near the earth.
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR>Since there was also a power partaking of the prophetic faculty, 
<A NAME="158"></A>the power is called Themis, because of its telling what is appointed and 
<A NAME="159"></A>fixed for each person.
<A NAME="160"></A><BR><BR>In all these ways, then, the power of the earth finds an interpretation 
<A NAME="161"></A>and is worshipped: as a virgin and Hestia, she holds the centre; as a mother 
<A NAME="162"></A>she nourishes; as Rhea she makes rocks and dwells on mountains; as Demeter, 
<A NAME="163"></A>she produces herbage; and as Themis, she utters oracles: while the seminal 
<A NAME="164"></A>law which descends into her bosom is figured as Priapus, the influence 
<A NAME="165"></A>of which on dry crops is called Kore, and on soft fruits and shellfruits 
<A NAME="166"></A>is called Dionysus. For Kore was carried off by Pluto, that is, the sun 
<A NAME="167"></A>going; down beneath the earth at seed-time; but Dionysus begins to sprout 
<A NAME="168"></A>according to the conditions of the power which, while young, is hidden 
<A NAME="169"></A>beneath the earth, yet produces fine fruits, and is an ally of the power 
<A NAME="170"></A>in the blossom symbolized by Attis, and of the cutting of the ripened corn 
<A NAME="171"></A>symbolized by Adonis.
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR>Also the power of the wind which pervades all things is formed 
<A NAME="173"></A>into a figure of Silenus, and the perversion to frenzy into a figure of 
<A NAME="174"></A>a Bacchante, as also the impulse which excites to lust is represented by 
<A NAME="175"></A>the Satyrs. These, then, are the symbols by which the power of the earth 
<A NAME="176"></A>is revealed.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="177"></A><B>Fragment 8</B>

<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR>The whole power productive of water they called Oceanus, and named 
<A NAME="179"></A>its symbolic figure Tethys. But of the whole, the drinking-water produced 
<A NAME="180"></A>is called Achelous; and the sea-water Poseidon; while again that which 
<A NAME="181"></A>makes the sea, inasmuch as it is productive, is Amphitrite. Of the sweet 
<A NAME="182"></A>waters the particular powers are called Nymphs, and those of the sea-waters 
<A NAME="183"></A>Nereids.
<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR>Again, the power of fire they called Hephaestus, and have made 
<A NAME="185"></A>his image in the form of a man, but put on it a blue cap as a symbol of 
<A NAME="186"></A>the revolution of the heavens, because the archetypal and purest form of 
<A NAME="187"></A>fire is there. But the fire brought down from heaven to earth is less intense, 
<A NAME="188"></A>and wants the strengthening and support which is found in matter: wherefore 
<A NAME="189"></A>he is lame, as needing matter to support him.
<A NAME="190"></A><BR><BR>Also they supposed a power of this kind to belong to the sun and 
<A NAME="191"></A>called it Apollo, from the pulsation of his beams. There are also nine 
<A NAME="192"></A>Muses singing to his lyre, which are the sublunar sphere, and seven spheres 
<A NAME="193"></A>of the planets, and one of the fixed stars. And they crowned him with laurel, 
<A NAME="194"></A>partly because the plant is full of fire, and therefore hated by daemons; 
<A NAME="195"></A>and partly because it crackles in burning, to represent the god's prophetic 
<A NAME="196"></A>art.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>But inasmuch as the sun wards off the evils of the earth, they 
<A NAME="198"></A>called him Heracles (from his clashing against the air) in passing from 
<A NAME="199"></A>east to west. And they invented fables of his performing twelve labours, 
<A NAME="200"></A>as the symbol of the division of the signs of the zodiac in heaven; and 
<A NAME="201"></A>they arrayed him with a club and a lion's skin, the one as an indication 
<A NAME="202"></A>of his uneven motion, and the other representative of his strength in "Leo" 
<A NAME="203"></A>the sign of the zodiac.
<A NAME="204"></A><BR><BR>Of the sun's healing power Asclepius is the symbol, and to him 
<A NAME="205"></A>they have given the staff as a sign of the support and rest of the sick, 
<A NAME="206"></A>and the serpent is wound round it, as significant of his preservation of 
<A NAME="207"></A>body and soul: for the animal is most full of spirit, and shuffles off 
<A NAME="208"></A>the weakness of the body. It seems also to have a great faculty for healing: 
<A NAME="209"></A>for it found the remedy for giving clear sight, and is said in a legend 
<A NAME="210"></A>to know a certain plant which restores life.
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR>But the fiery power of his revolving and circling motion, whereby 
<A NAME="212"></A>he ripens the crops, is called Dionysus, not in the same sense as the power 
<A NAME="213"></A>which produces the juicy fruits, but either from the sun's rotation, or 
<A NAME="214"></A>from his completing his orbit in the heaven. And whereas he revolves round 
<A NAME="215"></A>the cosmical seasons and is the maker of "times and tides," the sun is 
<A NAME="216"></A>on this account called Horus.
<A NAME="217"></A><BR><BR>Of his power over agriculture, whereon depend the gifts of wealth, 
<A NAME="218"></A>the symbol is Pluto. He has, however, equally the power of destroying, 
<A NAME="219"></A>on which account they make Sarapis share the temple of Pluto: and the purple 
<A NAME="220"></A>tunic they make the symbol of the light that has sunk beneath the earth, 
<A NAME="221"></A>and the sceptre broken at the top that of his power below, and the posture 
<A NAME="222"></A>of the hand the symbol of his departure into the unseen 
<A NAME="223"></A>world.
<A NAME="224"></A><BR><BR>Cerberus is represented with three heads, because the positions 
<A NAME="225"></A>of the sun above the earth are three-rising, midday, and 
<A NAME="226"></A>setting.
<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR>The moon, conceived according to her brightness, they called Artemis, 
<A NAME="228"></A>as it were, "cutting the air." And Artemis, though herself a virgin, presides 
<A NAME="229"></A>over childbirth, because the power of the new moon is helpful to 
<A NAME="230"></A>parturition.
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR>What Apollo is to the sun, that Athena is to the moon: for the 
<A NAME="232"></A>moon is a symbol of wisdom, and so a kind of Athena.
<A NAME="233"></A><BR><BR>But, again, the moon is Hecate, the symbol of her varying phases 
<A NAME="234"></A>and of her power dependent on the phases. Wherefore her power appears in 
<A NAME="235"></A>three forms, having as symbol of the new moon the figure in the white robe 
<A NAME="236"></A>and golden sandals, and torches lighted: the basket, which she bears when 
<A NAME="237"></A>she has mounted high, is the symbol of the cultivation of the crops, which 
<A NAME="238"></A>she makes to grow up according to the increase of her light: and again 
<A NAME="239"></A>the symbol of the full moon is the goddess of the brazen 
<A NAME="240"></A>sandals.
<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR>Or even from the branch of olive one might infer her fiery nature, 
<A NAME="242"></A>and from the poppy her productiveness, and the multitude of the souls who 
<A NAME="243"></A>find an abode in her as in a city, for the poppy is an emblem of a city. 
<A NAME="244"></A>She bears a bow, like Artemis, because of the sharpness of the pangs of 
<A NAME="245"></A>labour.
<A NAME="246"></A><BR><BR>And, again, the Fates are referred to her powers, Clotho to the 
<A NAME="247"></A>generative, and Lachesis to the nutritive, and Atropos to the inexorable 
<A NAME="248"></A>will of the deity.
<A NAME="249"></A><BR><BR>Also, the power productive of corn-crops, which is Demeter, they 
<A NAME="250"></A>associate with her, as producing power in her. The moon is also a supporter 
<A NAME="251"></A>of Kore. They set Dionysus also beside her, both on account of their growth 
<A NAME="252"></A>of horns, and because of the region of clouds lying beneath the lower 
<A NAME="253"></A>world.
<A NAME="254"></A><BR><BR>The power of Kronos they perceived to be sluggish and slow and 
<A NAME="255"></A>cold, and therefore attributed to him the power of time: and they figure 
<A NAME="256"></A>him standing, and grey-headed, to indicate that time is growing 
<A NAME="257"></A>old.
<A NAME="258"></A><BR><BR>The Curetes, attending on Chronos, are symbols of the seasons, 
<A NAME="259"></A>because time journeys on through seasons.
<A NAME="260"></A><BR><BR>Of the Hours, some are the Olympian, belonging to the sun, which 
<A NAME="261"></A>also open the gates in the air: and others are earthly, belonging to Demeter, 
<A NAME="262"></A>and hold a basket, one symbolic of the flowers of spring, and the other 
<A NAME="263"></A>of the wheat-ears of summer.
<A NAME="264"></A><BR><BR>The power of Ares they perceived to be fiery, and represented it 
<A NAME="265"></A>as causing war and bloodshed, and capable both of harm and 
<A NAME="266"></A>benefit.
<A NAME="267"></A><BR><BR>The star of Aphrodite they observed as tending to fecundity, being 
<A NAME="268"></A>the cause of desire and offspring, and represented it as a woman because 
<A NAME="269"></A>of generation, and as beautiful, because it is also the evening star 
<A NAME="270"></A>-
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>"Hesper, the fairest star that shines in heaven." [Homer, Iliad 
<A NAME="272"></A>22:318]
<A NAME="273"></A><BR><BR>And Eros they set by her because of desire. She veils her breasts 
<A NAME="274"></A>and other parts, because their power is the source of generation and nourishment. 
<A NAME="275"></A>She comes from the sea, a watery element, and warm, and in constant movement, 
<A NAME="276"></A>and foaming because of its commotion, whereby they intimate the seminal 
<A NAME="277"></A>power.
<A NAME="278"></A><BR><BR>Hermes is the representative of reason and speech, which both accomplish 
<A NAME="279"></A>and interpret all things. The phallic Hermes represents vigour, but also 
<A NAME="280"></A>indicates the generative law that pervades all things.
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR>Further, reason is composite: in the sun it is called Hermes; in 
<A NAME="282"></A>the moon Hecate; and that which is in the All Hermopan, for the generative 
<A NAME="283"></A>and creative reason extends over all things. Hermanubis also is composite, 
<A NAME="284"></A>and as it were half Greek, being found among the Egyptians also. Since 
<A NAME="285"></A>speech is also connected with the power of love, Eros represents this power: 
<A NAME="286"></A>wherefore Eros is represented as the son of Hermes, but as an infant, because 
<A NAME="287"></A>of his sudden impulses of desire.
<A NAME="288"></A><BR><BR>They made Pan the symbol of the universe, and gave him his horns 
<A NAME="289"></A>as symbols of sun and moon, and the fawn skin as emblem of the stars in 
<A NAME="290"></A>heaven, or of the variety of the universe.

<A NAME="291"></A><B>Fragment 10</B>

<A NAME="292"></A><BR><BR>The Demiurge, whom the Egyptians call Cneph, is of human form, 
<A NAME="293"></A>but with a skin of dark blue, holding a girdle and a sceptre, and crowned 
<A NAME="294"></A>with a royal wing on his head, because reason is hard to discover, and 
<A NAME="295"></A>wrapt up in secret, and not conspicuous, and because it is life-giving, 
<A NAME="296"></A>and because it is a king, and because it has an intelligent motion: wherefore 
<A NAME="297"></A>the characteristic wing is put upon his head.
<A NAME="298"></A><BR><BR>This god, they say, puts forth from his mouth an egg, from which 
<A NAME="299"></A>is born a god who is called by themselves Phtha, but by the Greeks Hephaestus; 
<A NAME="300"></A>and the egg they interpret as the world. To this god the sheep is consecrated, 
<A NAME="301"></A>because the ancients used to drink milk.
<A NAME="302"></A><BR><BR>The representation of the world itself they figured thus: the statue 
<A NAME="303"></A>is like a man having feet joined together, and clothed from head to foot 
<A NAME="304"></A>with a robe of many colours, and has on the head a golden sphere, the first 
<A NAME="305"></A>to represent its immobility, the second the many-coloured nature of the 
<A NAME="306"></A>stars, and the third because the world is spherical.
<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR>The sun they indicate sometimes by a man embarked on a ship, the 
<A NAME="308"></A>ship set on a crocodile. And the ship indicates the sun's motion in a liquid 
<A NAME="309"></A>element: the crocodile potable water in which the sun travels. The figure 
<A NAME="310"></A>of the sun thus signified that his revolution takes place through air that 
<A NAME="311"></A>is liquid and sweet.
<A NAME="312"></A><BR><BR>The power of the earth, both the celestial and terrestrial earth, 
<A NAME="313"></A>they called Isis, because of the equality, which is the source of justice: 
<A NAME="314"></A>but they call the moon the celestial earth, and the vegetative earth, on 
<A NAME="315"></A>which we live, they call the terrestrial.
<A NAME="316"></A><BR><BR>Demeter has the same meaning among the Greeks as Isis amongs the 
<A NAME="317"></A>Egyptians: and, again, Kore and Dionysus among the Greeks the same as Isis 
<A NAME="318"></A>and Osiris among the Egyptians. Isis is that which nourishes and raises 
<A NAME="319"></A>up the fruits of the earth; and Osiris among the Egyptians is that which 
<A NAME="320"></A>supplies the fructifying power, which they propitiate with lamentations 
<A NAME="321"></A>as it disappears into the earth in the sowing, and as it is consumed by 
<A NAME="322"></A>us for food.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR><BR>Osiris is also taken for the river-power of the Nile: when, however, 
<A NAME="324"></A>they signify the terrestrial earth, Osiris is taken as the fructifying 
<A NAME="325"></A>power; but when the celestial, Osiris is the Nile, which they suppose to 
<A NAME="326"></A>come down from heaven: this also they bewail, in order to propitiate the 
<A NAME="327"></A>power when failing and becoming exhausted. And the Isis who, in the legends, 
<A NAME="328"></A>is wedded to Osiris is the land of Egypt, and therefore she is made equal 
<A NAME="329"></A>to him, and conceives, and produces the fruits; and on this account Osiris 
<A NAME="330"></A>has been described by tradition as the husband of Isis, and her brother, 
<A NAME="331"></A>and her son.
<A NAME="332"></A><BR><BR>At the city Elephantine there is an image worshipped, which in 
<A NAME="333"></A>other respects is fashioned in the likeness of a man and sitting; it is 
<A NAME="334"></A>of a blue colour, and has a ram's head, and a diadem bearing the horns 
<A NAME="335"></A>of a goat, above which is a quoit-shaped circle. He sits with a vessel 
<A NAME="336"></A>of clay beside him, on which he is moulding the figure of a man. And from 
<A NAME="337"></A>having the face of a ram and the horns of a goat he indicates the conjunction 
<A NAME="338"></A>of sun and moon in the sign of the Ram, while the colour of blue indicates 
<A NAME="339"></A>that the moon in that conjunction brings rain.
<A NAME="340"></A><BR><BR>The second appearance of the moon is held sacred in the city of 
<A NAME="341"></A>Apollo: and its symbol is a man with a hawk-like face, subduing with a 
<A NAME="342"></A>hunting-spear Typhon in the likeness of a hippopotamus. The image is white 
<A NAME="343"></A>in colour, the whiteness representing the illumination of the moon, and 
<A NAME="344"></A>the hawk-like face the fact that it derives light and breath from the sun. 
<A NAME="345"></A>For the hawk they consecrate to the sun, and make it their symbol of light 
<A NAME="346"></A>and breath, because of its swift motion, and its soaring up on high, where 
<A NAME="347"></A>the light is. And the hippopotamus represents, the Western sky, because 
<A NAME="348"></A>of its swallowing up into itself the stars which traverse 
<A NAME="349"></A>it.
<A NAME="350"></A><BR><BR>In this city Horus is worshipped as a god. But the city of Eileithyia 
<A NAME="351"></A>worships the third appearance of the moon: and her statue is fashioned 
<A NAME="352"></A>into a flying vulture, whose plumage consists of precious stones. And its 
<A NAME="353"></A>likeness to a vulture signifies that the moon is what produces the winds: 
<A NAME="354"></A>for they think that the vulture conceives from the wind, and declares that 
<A NAME="355"></A>they are all hen birds.
<A NAME="356"></A><BR><BR>In the mysteries at Eleusis the hierophant is dressed up to represent 
<A NAME="357"></A>the demiurge, and the torch-bearer the sun, the priest at the altar the 
<A NAME="358"></A>moon, and the sacred herald Hermes.
<A NAME="359"></A><BR><BR>Moreover a man is admitted by the Egyptians among their objects 
<A NAME="360"></A>of worship. For there is a village in Egypt called Anabis, in which a man 
<A NAME="361"></A>is worshipped, and sacrifice offered to him, and the victims burned upon 
<A NAME="362"></A>his altars: and after a little while he would eat the things that had been 
<A NAME="363"></A>prepared for him as for a man.
<A NAME="364"></A><BR><BR>They did not, however, believe the animals to be gods, but regarded 
<A NAME="365"></A>them as likenesses and symbols of gods; and this is shown by the fact that 
<A NAME="366"></A>in many places oxen dedicated to the gods are sacrificed at their monthly 
<A NAME="367"></A>festivals and in their religious services. For they consecrated oxen to 
<A NAME="368"></A>the sun and moon.
<A NAME="369"></A><BR><BR>The ox called Mnevis which is dedicated to the sun in Heliopolis, 
<A NAME="370"></A>is the largest of oxen, very black, chiefly because much sunshine blackens 
<A NAME="371"></A>men's bodies. And its tail and all its body are covered with hair that 
<A NAME="372"></A>bristles backwards unlike other cattle, just as the sun makes its course 
<A NAME="373"></A>in the opposite direction to the heaven. Its testicles are very large, 
<A NAME="374"></A>since desire is produced by heat, and the sun is said to fertilize 
<A NAME="375"></A>nature.
<A NAME="376"></A><BR><BR>To the moon they dedicated a bull which they call Apis, which also 
<A NAME="377"></A>is more black than others, and bears symbols of sun and moon, because the 
<A NAME="378"></A>light of the moon is from the sun. The blackness of his body is an emblem 
<A NAME="379"></A>of the sun, and so is the beetle-like mark under his tongue; and the symbol 
<A NAME="380"></A>of the moon is the semicircle, and the gibbous figure.
