<BR><BR>The same as in Oedipus the King, an open space before the royal palace, once that of Oedipus, at Thebes. The backscene represents the front of the palace, with three doors, of which the central and largest is the principal entrance into the house. The time is at daybreak on the morning after the fall of the two brothers, Eteocles and Polyneices, and the flight of the defeated Argives.

<A NAME="24"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Ismene, sister, mine own dear sister, knowest thou what ill 
<A NAME="25"></A>there is, of all bequeathed by Oedipus, that Zeus fulfils not for us twain 
<A NAME="26"></A>while we live? Nothing painful is there, nothing fraught with ruin, no 
<A NAME="27"></A>shame, no dishonour, that I have not seen in thy woes and 
<A NAME="28"></A>mine.
<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR>And now what new edict is this of which they tell, that our Captain 
<A NAME="30"></A>hath just published to all Thebes? Knowest thou aught? Hast thou heard? 
<A NAME="31"></A>Or is it hidden from thee that our friends are threatened with the doom 
<A NAME="32"></A>of our foes? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="33"></A><B>ISMENE</B>
<A NAME="34"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>No word of friends, Antigone, gladsome or painful, hath come 
<A NAME="35"></A>to me, since we two sisters were bereft of brothers twain, killed in one 
<A NAME="36"></A>day by twofold blow; and since in this last night the Argive host hath 
<A NAME="37"></A>fled, know no more, whether my fortune be brighter, or more grievous. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="38"></A><B>ANTIGONE</B>
<A NAME="39"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I knew it well, and therefore sought to bring thee beyond the 
<A NAME="40"></A>gates of the court, that thou mightest hear alone. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="41"></A><B>ISMENE</B>
<A NAME="42"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>What is it? 'Tis plain that thou art brooding on some dark 
<A NAME="43"></A>tidings. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="44"></A><B>ANTIGONE</B>
<A NAME="45"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>What, hath not Creon destined our brothers, the one to honoured 
<A NAME="46"></A>burial, the other to unburied shame? Eteocles, they say, with due observance 
<A NAME="47"></A>of right and custom, he hath laid in the earth, for his honour among the 
<A NAME="48"></A>dead below. But the hapless corpse of Polyneices-as rumour saith, it hath 
<A NAME="49"></A>been published to the town that none shall entomb him or mourn, but leave 
<A NAME="50"></A>unwept, unsepulchred, a welcome store for the birds, as they espy him, 
<A NAME="51"></A>to feast on at will.
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR>Such, 'tis said, is the edict that the good Creon hath set forth 
<A NAME="53"></A>for thee and for me,-yes, for me,-and is coming hither to proclaim it clearly 
<A NAME="54"></A>to those who know it not; nor counts the matter light, but, whoso disobeys 
<A NAME="55"></A>in aught, his doom is death by stoning before all the folk. Thou knowest 
<A NAME="56"></A>it now; and thou wilt soon show whether thou art nobly bred, or the base 
<A NAME="57"></A>daughter of a noble line. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="58"></A><B>ISMENE</B>
<A NAME="59"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Poor sister,-and if things stand thus, what could I help to 
<A NAME="60"></A>do or undo? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="61"></A><B>ANTIGONE</B>
<A NAME="62"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Consider if thou wilt share the toil and the deed. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="63"></A><B>ISMENE</B>

<A NAME="68"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Thou wouldst bury him,-when 'tis forbidden to Thebes? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="69"></A><B>ANTIGONE</B>
<A NAME="70"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I will do my part,-and thine, if thou wilt not,-to a brother. 
<A NAME="71"></A>False to him will I never be found. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="72"></A><B>ISMENE</B>
<A NAME="73"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Ah, over-bold! when Creon hath forbidden? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="74"></A><B>ANTIGONE</B>
<A NAME="75"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Nay, he hath no right to keep me from mine own. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="76"></A><B>ISMENE</B>
<A NAME="77"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Ah me! think, sister, how our father perished, amid hate and 
<A NAME="78"></A>scorn, when sins bared by his own search had moved him to strike both eyes 
<A NAME="79"></A>with self-blinding hand; then the mother wife, two names in one, with twisted 
<A NAME="80"></A>noose did despite unto her life; and last, our two brothers in one day,-each 
<A NAME="81"></A>shedding, hapless one, a kinsman's blood,-wrought out with mutual hands 
<A NAME="82"></A>their common doom. And now we in turn-we two left all alone think how we 
<A NAME="83"></A>shall perish, more miserably than all the rest, if, in defiance of the 
<A NAME="84"></A>law, we brave a king's decree or his powers. Nay, we must remember, first, 
<A NAME="85"></A>that we were born women, as who should not strive with men; next, that 
<A NAME="86"></A>we are ruled of the stronger, so that we must obey in these things, and 
<A NAME="87"></A>in things yet sorer. I, therefore, asking the Spirits Infernal to pardon, 
<A NAME="88"></A>seeing that force is put on me herein, will hearken to our rulers. for 
<A NAME="89"></A>'tis witless to be over busy. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="90"></A><B>ANTIGONE</B>
<A NAME="91"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I will not urge thee,-no nor, if thou yet shouldst have the 
<A NAME="92"></A>mind, wouldst thou be welcome as a worker with me. Nay, be what thou wilt; 
<A NAME="93"></A>but I will bury him: well for me to die in doing that. I shall rest, a 
<A NAME="94"></A>loved one with him whom I have loved, sinless in my crime; for I owe a 
<A NAME="95"></A>longer allegiance to the dead than to the living: in that world I shall 
<A NAME="96"></A>abide for ever. But if thou wilt, be guilty of dishonouring laws which 
<A NAME="97"></A>the gods have stablished in honour. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="98"></A><B>ISMENE</B>
<A NAME="99"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I do them no dishonour; but to defy the State,-I have no strength 
<A NAME="100"></A>for that. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="101"></A><B>ANTIGONE</B>
<A NAME="102"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Such be thy plea:-I, then, will go to heap the earth above 
<A NAME="103"></A>the brother whom I love. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="108"></A><B>ISMENE:</B>
<A NAME="109"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>At least, then, disclose this plan to none, but hide it closely,-and 
<A NAME="110"></A>so, too, will I. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="111"></A><B>ANTIGONE</B>
<A NAME="112"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Oh, denounce it! Thou wilt be far more hateful for thy silence, 
<A NAME="113"></A>if thou proclaim not these things to all. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="114"></A><B>ISMENE</B>
<A NAME="115"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Thou hast a hot heart for chilling deeds.

<A NAME="119"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Aye, if thou canst; but thou wouldst what thou canst not.

<A NAME="120"></A><B>ANTIGONE</B>
<A NAME="121"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Why, then, when my strength fails, I shall have done.

<A NAME="124"></A><B>ANTIGONE</B>
<A NAME="125"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>If thus thou speakest, thou wilt have hatred from me, and will 
<A NAME="126"></A>justly be subject to the lasting hatred of the dead. But leave me, and 
<A NAME="127"></A>the folly that is mine alone, to suffer this dread thing; for I shall not 
<A NAME="128"></A>suffer aught so dreadful as an ignoble death. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="129"></A><B>ISMENE</B>
<A NAME="130"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Go, then, if thou must; and of this be sure,-that though thine

<A NAME="149"></A>He paused above our dwellings; he ravened around our sevenfold portals

<A NAME="151"></A>glutted with our gore, or the Fire-god's pine-fed flame had seized our

<A NAME="164"></A>blasts of his tempestuous hate. But those threats fared not as he hoped;

<A NAME="186"></A><I>Enter CREON, from the central doors of the palace, in the garb of king,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="188"></A><B>CREON</B>
<A NAME="189"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Sirs, the vessel of our State, after being tossed on wild waves, 
<A NAME="190"></A>hath once more been safely steadied by the gods: and ye, out of all the 
<A NAME="191"></A>folk, have been called apart by my summons, because I knew, first of all, 
<A NAME="192"></A>how true and constant was your reverence for the royal power of Laius; 
<A NAME="193"></A>how, again, when Oedipus was ruler of our land, and when he had perished, 
<A NAME="194"></A>your steadfast loyalty still upheld their children. Since, then, his sons 
<A NAME="195"></A>have fallen in one day by a twofold doom,-each smitten by the other, each 
<A NAME="196"></A>stained with a brother's blood,-I now possess the throne and all its powers, 
<A NAME="197"></A>by nearness of kinship to the dead.
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR>No man can be fully known, in soul and spirit and mind, until he 
<A NAME="199"></A>hath been seen versed in rule and law-giving. For if any, being supreme 
<A NAME="200"></A>guide of the State, cleaves not to the best counsels, but, through some 
<A NAME="201"></A>fear, keeps his lips locked, I hold, and have ever held, him most base; 
<A NAME="202"></A>and if any makes a friend of more account than his fatherland, that man 
<A NAME="203"></A>hath no place in my regard. For I-be Zeus my witness, who sees all things 
<A NAME="204"></A>always-would not be silent if I saw ruin, instead of safety, coming to 
<A NAME="205"></A>the citizens; nor would I ever deem the country's foe a friend to myself; 
<A NAME="206"></A>remembering this, that our country is the ship that bears us safe, and 
<A NAME="207"></A>that only while she prospers in our voyage can we make true 
<A NAME="208"></A>friends.
<A NAME="209"></A><BR><BR>Such are the rules by which I guard this city's greatness. And 
<A NAME="210"></A>in accord with them is the edict which I have now published to the folk 
<A NAME="211"></A>touching the sons of Oedipus;-that Eteocles, who hath fallen fighting for 
<A NAME="212"></A>our city, in all renown of arms, shall be entombed, and crowned with every 
<A NAME="213"></A>rite that follows the noblest dead to their rest. But for his brother, 
<A NAME="214"></A>Polyneices,-who came back from exile, and sought to consume utterly with 
<A NAME="215"></A>fire the city of his fathers and the shrines of his fathers' gods,-sought 
<A NAME="216"></A>to taste of kindred blood, and to lead the remnant into slavery;-touching 
<A NAME="217"></A>this man, it hath been proclaimed to our people that none shall grace him 
<A NAME="218"></A>with sepulture or lament, but leave him unburied, a corpse for birds and 
<A NAME="219"></A>dogs to eat, a ghastly sight of shame.
<A NAME="220"></A><BR><BR>Such the spirit of my dealing; and never, by deed of mine, shall 
<A NAME="221"></A>the wicked stand in honour before the just; but whoso hath good will to 
<A NAME="222"></A>Thebes, he shall be honoured of me, in his life and in his death.

<A NAME="273"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I know not; no stroke of pickaxe was seen there, no earth thrown 
<A NAME="274"></A>up by mattock; the ground was hard and dry, unbroken, without track of 
<A NAME="275"></A>wheels; the doer was one who had left no trace. And when the first day-watchman 
<A NAME="276"></A>showed it to us, sore wonder fell on all. The dead man was veiled from 
<A NAME="277"></A>us; not shut within a tomb, but lightly strewn with dust, as by the hand 
<A NAME="278"></A>of one who shunned a curse. And no sign met the eye as though any beast 
<A NAME="279"></A>of prey or any dog had come nigh to him, or torn him.
<A NAME="280"></A><BR><BR>Then evil words flew fast and loud among us, guard accusing guard; 
<A NAME="281"></A>und it would e'en have come to blows at last, nor was there any to hinder. 
<A NAME="282"></A>Every man was the culprit, and no one was convicted, but all disclaimed 
<A NAME="283"></A>knowledge of the deed. And we were ready to take red-hot iron in our hands;-to 
<A NAME="284"></A>walk through fire;-to make oath by the gods that we had not done the deed,-that 
<A NAME="285"></A>we were not privy to the planning or the doing.
<A NAME="286"></A><BR><BR>At last, when all our searching was fruitless, one spake, who made 
<A NAME="287"></A>us all bend our faces on the earth in fear; for we saw not how we could 
<A NAME="288"></A>gainsay him, or escape mischance if we obeyed. His counsel was that this 
<A NAME="289"></A>deed must be reported to thee, and not hidden. And this seemed best; and 
<A NAME="290"></A>the lot doomed my hapless self to win this prize. So here I stand,-as unwelcome

<A NAME="352"></A>Wonders are many, and none is more wonderful than man; the power that crosses

<A NAME="354"></A>that threaten to engulf him; and Earth, the eldest of the gods, the immortal,

<A NAME="414"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>It befell on this wise. When we had come to the place,-with 
<A NAME="415"></A>those dread menaces of thine upon us,-we swept away all the dust that covered 
<A NAME="416"></A>the corpse, and bared the dank body well; and then sat us down on the brow 
<A NAME="417"></A>of the hill, to windward, heedful that the smell from him should not strike 
<A NAME="418"></A>us; every man was wide awake, and kept his neighbour alert with torrents 
<A NAME="419"></A>of threats, if anyone should be careless of this task.
<A NAME="420"></A><BR><BR>So went it, until the sun's bright orb stood in mid heaven, and 
<A NAME="421"></A>the heat began to burn: and then suddenly a whirlwind lifted from the earth 
<A NAME="422"></A>storm of dust, a trouble in the sky the plain, marring all the leafage 
<A NAME="423"></A>of its woods; and the wide air was choked therewith: we closed our eyes, 
<A NAME="424"></A>and bore the plague from the gods.
<A NAME="425"></A><BR><BR>And when, after a long while, this storm had passed, the maid was 
<A NAME="426"></A>seen; and she cried aloud with the sharp cry of a bird in its bitterness,-even 
<A NAME="427"></A>as when, within the empty nest, it sees the bed stripped of its nestlings. 
<A NAME="428"></A>So she also, when she saw the corpse bare, lifted up a voice of wailing, 
<A NAME="429"></A>and called down curses on the doers of that deed. And straightway she brought 
<A NAME="430"></A>thirsty dust in her hands; and from a shapely ewer of bronze, held high, 
<A NAME="431"></A>with thrice-poured drink-offering she crowned the dead.
<A NAME="432"></A><BR><BR>We rushed forward when we saw it, and at once dosed upon our quarry, 
<A NAME="433"></A>who was in no wise dismayed. Then we taxed her with her past and present 
<A NAME="434"></A>doings; and she stood not on denial of aught,-at once to my joy and to 
<A NAME="435"></A>my pain. To have escaped from ills one's self is a great joy; but 'tis

<A NAME="459"></A>life is not of to-day or yesterday, but from all time, and no man knows 
<A NAME="460"></A>when they were first put forth.
<A NAME="461"></A><BR><BR>Not through dread of any human pride could I answer to the gods 
<A NAME="462"></A>for breaking these. Die I must,-I knew that well (how should I not?)-even 
<A NAME="463"></A>without thy edicts. But if I am to die before my time, I count that a gain: 
<A NAME="464"></A>for when any one lives, as I do, compassed about with evils, can such an 
<A NAME="465"></A>one find aught but gain in death?
<A NAME="466"></A><BR><BR>So for me to meet this doom is trifling grief; but if I had suffered 
<A NAME="467"></A>my mother's son to lie in death an unburied corpse, that would have grieved

<A NAME="634"></A><I>strophe 1</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="635"></A>Blest are they whose days have not tasted of evil. For when a house hath 
<A NAME="636"></A>once been shaken from heaven, there the curse fails nevermore, passing 
<A NAME="637"></A>from life to life of the race; even as, when the surge is driven over the 
<A NAME="638"></A>darkness of the deep by the fierce breath of Thracian sea-winds, it rolls 
<A NAME="639"></A>up the black sand from the depths, and there is sullen roar from wind-vexed 
<A NAME="640"></A>headlands that front the blows of the storm. <BR><BR><I>antistrophe 
<A NAME="641"></A>1</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="642"></A>I see that from olden time the sorrows in the house of the Labdacidae are 
<A NAME="643"></A>heaped upon the sorrows of the dead; and generation is not freed by generation, 
<A NAME="644"></A>but some god strikes them down, and the race hath no 
<A NAME="645"></A>deliverance.
<A NAME="646"></A><BR><BR>For now that hope of which the light had been spread above the 
<A NAME="647"></A>last root of the house of Oedipus-that hope, in turn, is brought low--by 
<A NAME="648"></A>the blood-stained dust due to the gods infernal, and by folly in speech, 
<A NAME="649"></A>and frenzy at the heart. <BR><BR><I>strophe 2</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="650"></A>Thy power, O Zeus, what human trespass can limit? That power which neither 
<A NAME="651"></A>Sleep, the all-ensnaring, nor the untiring months of the gods can master; 
<A NAME="652"></A>but thou, a ruler to whom time brings not old age, dwellest in the dazzling 
<A NAME="653"></A>splendour of Olympus.
<A NAME="654"></A><BR><BR>And through the future, near and far, as through the past, shall 
<A NAME="655"></A>this law hold good: Nothing that is vast enters into the life of mortals 
<A NAME="656"></A>without a curse. <BR><BR><I>antistrophe 2</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="657"></A>For that hope whose wanderings are so wide is to many men a comfort, but 
<A NAME="658"></A>to many a false lure of giddy desires; and the disappointment comes on 
<A NAME="659"></A>one who knoweth nought till he burn his foot against the hot 
<A NAME="660"></A>fire.
<A NAME="661"></A><BR><BR>For with wisdom hath some one given forth the famous saying, that 
<A NAME="662"></A>evil seems good, soon or late, to him whose mind the god draws to mischief; 
<A NAME="663"></A>and but for the briefest space doth he fare free of woe.

<A NAME="678"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Yea, this, my son, should be thy heart's fixed law,-in all 
<A NAME="679"></A>things to obey thy father's will. 'Tis for this that men pray to see dutiful 
<A NAME="680"></A>children grow up around them in their homes,-that such may requite their 
<A NAME="681"></A>father's foe with evil, and honour, as their father doth, his friend. But 
<A NAME="682"></A>he who begets unprofitable children-what shall we say that he hath sown, 
<A NAME="683"></A>but troubles for himself, and much triumph for his foes? Then do not thou, 
<A NAME="684"></A>my son, at pleasure's beck, dethrone thy reason for a woman's sake; knowing 
<A NAME="685"></A>that this is a joy that soon grows cold in clasping arms,-an evil woman 
<A NAME="686"></A>to share thy bed and thy home. For what wound could strike deeper than 
<A NAME="687"></A>a false friend? Nay, with loathing, and as if she were thine enemy, let 
<A NAME="688"></A>this girl go to find a husband in the house of Hades. For since I have 
<A NAME="689"></A>taken her, alone of all the city, in open disobedience, I will not make 
<A NAME="690"></A>myself a liar to my people-I will slay her.
<A NAME="691"></A><BR><BR>So let her appeal as she will to the majesty of kindred blood. 
<A NAME="692"></A>If I am to nurture mine own kindred in naughtiness, needs must I bear with 
<A NAME="693"></A>it in aliens. He who does his duty in his own household will be found righteous 
<A NAME="694"></A>in the State also. But if any one transgresses, and does violence to the 
<A NAME="695"></A>laws, or thinks to dictate to his rulers, such an one can win no praise 
<A NAME="696"></A>from me. No, whomsoever the city may appoint, that man must be obeyed, 
<A NAME="697"></A>in little things and great, in just things and unjust; and I should feel 
<A NAME="698"></A>sure that one who thus obeys would be a good ruler no less than a good 
<A NAME="699"></A>subject, and in the storm of spears would stand his ground where he was 
<A NAME="700"></A>set, loyal and dauntless at his comrade's side.
<A NAME="701"></A><BR><BR>But disobedience is the worst of evils. This it is that ruins cities; 
<A NAME="702"></A>this makes homes desolate; by this, the ranks of allies are broken into 
<A NAME="703"></A>head-long rout; but, of the lives whose course is fair, the greater part 
<A NAME="704"></A>owes safety to obedience. Therefore we must support the cause of order, 
<A NAME="705"></A>and in no wise suffer a woman to worst us. Better to fall from power, if 
<A NAME="706"></A>we must, by a man's hand; then we should not be called weaker than a woman.

<A NAME="716"></A>frown forbids the citizen to speak such words as would offend thine ear; 
<A NAME="717"></A>but can hear these murmurs in the dark, these moanings of the city for 
<A NAME="718"></A>this maiden; 'no woman,' they say, 'ever merited her doom less,-none ever 
<A NAME="719"></A>was to die so shamefully for deeds so glorious as hers; who, when her own 
<A NAME="720"></A>brother had fallen in bloody strife, would not leave him unburied, to be 
<A NAME="721"></A>devoured by carrion dogs, or by any bird:-deserves not she the meed of 
<A NAME="722"></A>golden honour?'
<A NAME="723"></A><BR><BR>Such is the darkling rumour that spreads in secret. For me, my 
<A NAME="724"></A>father, no treasure is so precious as thy welfare. What, indeed, is a nobler 
<A NAME="725"></A>ornament for children than a prospering sire's fair fame, or for sire than 
<A NAME="726"></A>son's? Wear not, then, one mood only in thyself; think not that thy word, 
<A NAME="727"></A>and thine alone, must be right. For if any man thinks that he alone is 
<A NAME="728"></A>wise,-that in speech, or in mind, he hath no peer,-such a soul, when laid 
<A NAME="729"></A>open, is ever found empty.
<A NAME="730"></A><BR><BR>No, though a man be wise, 'tis no shame for him to learn many things,

<A NAME="736"></A><BR><BR>Nay, forego thy wrath; permit thyself to change. For if I, a younger 
<A NAME="737"></A>man, may offer my thought, it were far best, I ween, that men should be

<A NAME="1227"></A><BR><BR>And as the king drew nearer, doubtful sounds of a bitter cry floated

<A NAME="1235"></A><BR><BR>This search, at our despairing master's word, we went to make; 
<A NAME="1236"></A>and in the furthest part of the tomb we descried her hanging by the neck,

<A NAME="1241"></A><BR><BR>But his father, when he saw him, cried aloud with a dread cry and
