<A NAME="22"></A><B>PAEDAGOGUS</B>
<A NAME="23"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Son of him who led our hosts at Troy of old, son of Agamemnon!- 
<A NAME="24"></A>now thou mayest behold with thine eyes all that thy soul hath desired so 
<A NAME="25"></A>long. There is the ancient Argos of thy yearning,- that hallowed scene 
<A NAME="26"></A>whence the gadfly drove the daughter of Inachus; and there, Orestes, is 
<A NAME="27"></A>the Lycean Agora, named from the wolf-slaying god; there, on the left, 
<A NAME="28"></A>Hera's famous temple; and in this place to which we have come, deem that 
<A NAME="29"></A>thou seest Mycenae rich in gold, with the house of the Pelopidae there, 
<A NAME="30"></A>so often stained with bloodshed; whence I carried thee of yore, from the 
<A NAME="31"></A>slaying of thy father, as thy kinswoman, thy sister, charged me; and saved 
<A NAME="32"></A>thee, and reared thee up to manhood, to be the avenger of thy murdered 
<A NAME="33"></A>sire.
<A NAME="34"></A><BR><BR>Now, therefore, Orestes, and thou, best of friends, Pylades, our 
<A NAME="35"></A>plans must be laid quickly; for lo, already the sun's bright ray is waking 
<A NAME="36"></A>the songs of the birds into clearness, and the dark night of stars is spent. 
<A NAME="37"></A>Before, then, anyone comes forth from the house, take counsel; seeing that 
<A NAME="38"></A>the time allows not of delay, but is full ripe for deeds. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="39"></A><B>ORESTES</B>
<A NAME="40"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>True friend and follower, how well dost thou prove thy loyalty 
<A NAME="41"></A>to our house! As a steed of generous race, though old, loses not courage 
<A NAME="42"></A>in danger, but pricks his ear, even so thou urgest us forward, and art 
<A NAME="43"></A>foremost in our support. I will tell thee, then, what I have determined; 
<A NAME="44"></A>listen closely to my words, and correct me, if I miss the mark in 
<A NAME="45"></A>aught.
<A NAME="46"></A><BR><BR>When I went to the Pythian oracle, to learn how I might avenge 
<A NAME="47"></A>my father on his murderers, Phoebus gave me the response which thou art 
<A NAME="48"></A>now to hear:- that alone, and by stealth, without aid of arms or numbers, 
<A NAME="49"></A>I should snatch the righteous vengeance of my hand. Since, then, the god 
<A NAME="50"></A>spake to us on this wise, thou must go into yonder house, when opportunity 
<A NAME="51"></A>gives thee entrance, and learn all that is passing there, so that thou 
<A NAME="52"></A>mayest report to us from sure knowledge. Thine age, and the lapse of time, 
<A NAME="53"></A>will prevent them from recognising thee; they will never suspect who thou 
<A NAME="54"></A>art, with that silvered hair. Let thy tale be that thou art a Phocian stranger, 
<A NAME="55"></A>sent by Phanoteus; for he is the greatest of their allies. Tell them, and 
<A NAME="56"></A>confirm it with thine oath, that Orestes hath perished by a fatal chance,- 
<A NAME="57"></A>hurled at the Pythian games from his rapid chariot; be that the substance 
<A NAME="58"></A>of thy story.
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR>We, meanwhile, will first crown my father's tomb, as the god enjoined, 
<A NAME="60"></A>with drink-offerings and the luxuriant tribute of severed hair; then come 
<A NAME="61"></A>back, bearing in our hands an urn of shapely bronze,-now hidden in the 
<A NAME="62"></A>brushwood, as I think thou knowest,- so to gladden them with the false 
<A NAME="63"></A>tidings that this my body is no more, but has been consumed with fire and 
<A NAME="64"></A>turned to ashes. Why should the omen trouble me, when by a feigned death 
<A NAME="65"></A>I find life indeed, and win renown? I trow, no word is ill-omened, if fraught 
<A NAME="66"></A>with gain. Often ere now have I seen wise men die in vain report; then, 
<A NAME="67"></A>when they return home, they are held in more abiding honour: as I trust 
<A NAME="68"></A>that from this rumour I also shall emerge in radiant life, and yet shine 
<A NAME="69"></A>like a star upon my foes.
<A NAME="70"></A><BR><BR>O my fatherland, and ye gods of the land, receive me with good 
<A NAME="71"></A>fortune in this journey,- and ye also, halls of my fathers, for I come 
<A NAME="72"></A>with divine mandate to cleanse you righteously; send me not dishonoured 
<A NAME="73"></A>from the land, but grant that I may rule over my possessions, and restore 
<A NAME="74"></A>my house!
<A NAME="75"></A><BR><BR>Enough;- be it now thy care, old man, to go and heed thy task; 
<A NAME="76"></A>and we twain will go forth; for so occasion bids, chief ruler of every 
<A NAME="77"></A>enterprise for men. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<A NAME="88"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>No, no: before all else, let us seek to obey the command of 
<A NAME="89"></A>Loxias, and thence make a fair beginning, by pouring libations to thy sire; 
<A NAME="90"></A>that brings victory within our grasp, and gives us the mastery in all that

<A NAME="96"></A><I>systema</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="97"></A>O thou pure sunlight, and thou air, earth's canopy, how often have ye heard 
<A NAME="98"></A>the strains of my lament, the wild blows dealt against this bleeding breast, 
<A NAME="99"></A>when dark night fails! And my wretched couch in yonder house of woe knows 
<A NAME="100"></A>well, ere now, how I keep the watches of the night,- how often I bewail 
<A NAME="101"></A>my hapless sire; to whom deadly Ares gave not of his gifts in a strange 
<A NAME="102"></A>land, but my mother, and her mate Aegisthus, cleft his head with murderous 
<A NAME="103"></A>axe, as woodmen fell an oak. And for this no plaint bursts from any lip 
<A NAME="104"></A>save mine, when thou, my father, hath died a death so cruel and so piteous! 
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR><I>antisystema</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="106"></A>But never will I cease from dirge and sore lament, while I look on the 
<A NAME="107"></A>trembling rays of the bright stars, or on this light of day; but like the 
<A NAME="108"></A>nightingale, slayer of her offspring, I will wail without ceasing, and 
<A NAME="109"></A>cry aloud to all, here, at the doors of my father.
<A NAME="110"></A><BR><BR>O home of Hades and Persephone! O Hermes of the shades! potent 
<A NAME="111"></A>Curse, and ye, dread daughters of the gods, Erinyes,- Ye who behold when 
<A NAME="112"></A>a life is reft by violence, when a bed is dishonoured by stealth,- come, 
<A NAME="113"></A>help me, avenge the murder of my sire,- and send to me my brother; for 
<A NAME="114"></A>I have no more the strength to bear up alone against the load of grief 
<A NAME="115"></A>that weighs me down. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="120"></A><BLOCKQUOTE><I>strophe 1</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="121"></A>Ah, Electra, child of a wretched mother, why art thou ever pining thus 
<A NAME="122"></A>in ceaseless lament for Agamemnon, who long ago was wickedly ensnared by 
<A NAME="123"></A>thy false mother's wiles, and betrayed to death by dastardly hand? Perish 
<A NAME="124"></A>the author of that deed, if I may utter such prayer! 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="125"></A><B>ELECTRA</B>
<A NAME="126"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Ah, noble-hearted maidens, ye have come to soothe my woes. 
<A NAME="127"></A>I know and feel it, it escapes me not; but I cannot leave this task undone, 
<A NAME="128"></A>or cease from mourning for my hapless sire. Ah, friends whose love responds 
<A NAME="129"></A>to mine in every mood, leave me to rave thus,- Oh leave me, I entreat you! 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="130"></A><B>CHORUS</B>
<A NAME="131"></A><BLOCKQUOTE><I>antistrophe 1</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="132"></A>But never by laments or prayers shalt thou recall thy sire from that lake 
<A NAME="133"></A>of Hades to which all must pass. Nay, thine is a fatal course of grief, 
<A NAME="134"></A>passing ever from due bounds into a cureless sorrow; wherein there is no 
<A NAME="135"></A>deliverance from evils. Say, wherefore art thou enamoured of misery? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="136"></A><B>ELECTRA</B>
<A NAME="137"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Foolish is the child who forgets a parent's piteous death. 
<A NAME="138"></A>No, dearer to my soul is the mourner that laments for Itys, Itys, evermore, 
<A NAME="139"></A>that bird distraught with grief, the messenger of Zeus. Ah, queen of sorrow, 
<A NAME="140"></A>Niobe, thee I deem divine,- thee, who evermore weepest in thy rocky tomb! 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="141"></A><B>CHORUS</B>
<A NAME="142"></A><BLOCKQUOTE><I>strophe 2</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="143"></A>Not to thee alone of mortals, my daughter, hath come any sorrow which thou 
<A NAME="144"></A>bearest less calmly than those within, thy kinswomen and sisters, Chrysothemis 
<A NAME="145"></A>and Iphianassa,I who still live,- as he, too, lives, sorrowing in a secluded 
<A NAME="146"></A>youth, yet happy in that this famous realm of Mycenae shall one day welcome 
<A NAME="147"></A>him to his heritage, when the kindly guidance of Zeus shall have brought 
<A NAME="148"></A>him to this land, Orestes. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="149"></A><B>ELECTRA</B>
<A NAME="150"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Yes, I wait for him with unwearied longing, as I move on my 
<A NAME="151"></A>sad path from day to day, unwed and childless, bathed in tears, bearing 
<A NAME="152"></A>that endless doom of woe; but he forgets all that he has suffered and heard. 
<A NAME="153"></A>What message comes to me, that is not belied? He is ever yearning to be 
<A NAME="154"></A>with us, but, though he yearns, he never resolves. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="155"></A><B>CHORUS</B>
<A NAME="156"></A><BLOCKQUOTE><I>antistrophe 2</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="157"></A>Courage, my daughter, courage; great still in heaven is Zeus, who sees 
<A NAME="158"></A>and governs all: leave thy bitter quarrel to him; forget not thy foes, 
<A NAME="159"></A>but refrain from excess of wrath against them; for Time is god who makes 
<A NAME="160"></A>rough ways smooth. Not heedless is the son of Agamemnon, who dwells by 
<A NAME="161"></A>Crisa's pastoral shore; not heedless is the god who reigns by Acheron. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="162"></A><B>ELECTRA</B>
<A NAME="163"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Nay, the best part of life hath passed away from me in hopelessness, 
<A NAME="164"></A>and I have no strength left; I, who am pining away without children,- whom 
<A NAME="165"></A>no loving champion shields,- but, like some despised alien, I serve in 
<A NAME="166"></A>the halls of my father, clad in this mean garb, and standing at a meagre 
<A NAME="167"></A>board. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="168"></A><B>CHORUS</B>
<A NAME="169"></A><BLOCKQUOTE><I>strophe 3</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="170"></A>Piteous was the voice heard at his return, and piteous, as thy sire lay 
<A NAME="171"></A>on the festal couch, when the straight, swift blow was dealt him with the 
<A NAME="172"></A>blade of bronze. Guile was the plotter, Lust the slayer, dread parents 
<A NAME="173"></A>of a dreadful shape; whether it was mortal that wrought therein, or god. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="174"></A><B>ELECTRA</B>
<A NAME="175"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>O that bitter day, bitter beyond all that have come to me; 
<A NAME="176"></A>O that night, O the horrors of that unutterable feast, the ruthless deathstrokes 
<A NAME="177"></A>that my father saw from the hands of twain, who took my life captive by 
<A NAME="178"></A>treachery, who doomed me to woe! May the great god of Olympus give them 
<A NAME="179"></A>sufferings in requital, and never may their splendour bring them joy, who 
<A NAME="180"></A>have done such deeds! </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="181"></A><B>CHORUS</B>
<A NAME="182"></A><BLOCKQUOTE><I>antistrophe 3</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="183"></A>Be advised to say no more; canst thou not see what conduct it is which 
<A NAME="184"></A>already plunges thee so cruelly in self-made miseries? Thou hast greatly 
<A NAME="185"></A>aggravated thy troubles, ever breeding wars with thy sullen soul; but such 
<A NAME="186"></A>strife should not be pushed to a conflict with the strong. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="187"></A><B>ELECTRA</B>
<A NAME="188"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I have been forced to it,- forced by dread causes; I know my 
<A NAME="189"></A>own passion, it escapes me not; but, seeing that the causes are so dire, 
<A NAME="190"></A>will never curb these frenzied plaints, while life is in me. Who indeed, 
<A NAME="191"></A>ye kindly sisterhood, who that thinks aright, would deem that any word 
<A NAME="192"></A>of solace could avail me? Forbear, forbear, my comforters! Such ills must 
<A NAME="193"></A>be numbered with those which have no cure; I can never know a respite from 
<A NAME="194"></A>my sorrows, or a limit to this wailing. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="195"></A><B>CHORUS</B>
<A NAME="196"></A><BLOCKQUOTE><I>epode</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="197"></A>At least it is in love, like a true-hearted mother, that I dissuade thee

<A NAME="199"></A><B>ELECTRA</B>
<A NAME="200"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>But what measure is there in my wretchedness? Say, how can 
<A NAME="201"></A>it be right to neglect the dead? Was that impiety ever born in mortal? 
<A NAME="202"></A>Never may I have praise of such; never when my lot is cast in pleasant 
<A NAME="203"></A>places, may I cling to selfish ease, or dishonour my sire by restraining 
<A NAME="204"></A>the wings of shrill lamentation!
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR>For if the hapless dead is to lie in dust and nothingness, while 
<A NAME="206"></A>the slayers pay not with blood for blood, all regard for man, all fear 
<A NAME="207"></A>of heaven, will vanish from the earth. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="208"></A><B>LEADER OF THE CHORUS</B>
<A NAME="209"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I came, my child, in zeal for thy welfare no less than for 
<A NAME="210"></A>mine own; but if I speak not well, then be it as thou wilt; for we will 
<A NAME="211"></A>follow thee. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="212"></A><B>ELECTRA</B>
<A NAME="213"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I am ashamed, my friends, if ye deem me too impatient for my 
<A NAME="214"></A>oft complaining; but, since a hard constraint forces me to this, bear with 
<A NAME="215"></A>me. How indeed could any woman of noble nature refrain, who saw the calamities 
<A NAME="216"></A>of a father's house, as I see them by day and night continually, not fading, 
<A NAME="217"></A>but in the summer of their strength? I, who, first, from the mother that 
<A NAME="218"></A>bore me have found bitter enmity; next, in mine own home I dwell with my 
<A NAME="219"></A>father's murderers; they rule over me, and with them it rests to give or 
<A NAME="220"></A>to withhold what I need.
<A NAME="221"></A><BR><BR>And then think what manner of days I pass, when I see Aegisthus 
<A NAME="222"></A>sitting on my father's throne, wearing the robes which he wore, and pouring 
<A NAME="223"></A>libations at the hearth where he slew my sire; and when I see the outrage 
<A NAME="224"></A>that crowns all, the murderer in our father's bed at our wretched mother's 
<A NAME="225"></A>side, if mother she should be called, who is his wife; but so hardened 
<A NAME="226"></A>is she that she lives with that accursed one, fearing no Erinys; nay, as 
<A NAME="227"></A>if exulting in her deeds, having found the day on which she treacherously 
<A NAME="228"></A>slew my father of old, she keeps it with dance and song, and month by month 
<A NAME="229"></A>sacrifices sheep to the gods who have wrought her deliverance.
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR>But I, hapless one, beholding it, weep and pine in the house, and 
<A NAME="231"></A>bewail the unholy feast named after my sire,- weep to myself alone; since 
<A NAME="232"></A>I may not even indulge my grief to the full measure of my yearning. For 
<A NAME="233"></A>this woman, in professions so noble, loudly upbraids me with such taunts 
<A NAME="234"></A>as these: 'Impious and hateful girl, hast thou alone lost a father, and 
<A NAME="235"></A>is there no other mourner in the world? An evil doom be thine, and may 
<A NAME="236"></A>the gods infernal give thee no riddance from thy present 
<A NAME="237"></A>laments.'
<A NAME="238"></A><BR><BR>Thus she insults; save when any one brings her word that Orestes 
<A NAME="239"></A>is coming: then, infuriated, she comes up to me, and cries;- 'Hast not 
<A NAME="240"></A>thou brought this upon me? Is not this deed thine, who didst steal Orestes

<A NAME="622"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I was sent for that purpose, and will tell thee all. Having 
<A NAME="623"></A>gone to the renowned festival, the pride of Greece, for the Delphian games, 
<A NAME="624"></A>when he heard the loud summons to the foot-race which was first to be decided, 
<A NAME="625"></A>he entered the lists, a brilliant form, a wonder in the eyes of all there; 
<A NAME="626"></A>and, having finished his course at the point where it began, he went out 
<A NAME="627"></A>with the glorious meed of victory. To speak briefly, where there is much 
<A NAME="628"></A>to tell, I know not the man whose deeds and triumphs have matched his; 
<A NAME="629"></A>but one thing thou must know; in all the contests that the judges announced, 
<A NAME="630"></A>he bore away the prize; and men deemed him happy, as oft as the herald 
<A NAME="631"></A>proclaimed him an Argive, by name Orestes, son of Agamemnon, who once gathered 
<A NAME="632"></A>the famous armament of Greece.
<A NAME="633"></A><BR><BR>Thus far, 'twas well; but, when a god sends harm, not even the 
<A NAME="634"></A>strong man can escape. For, on another day, when chariots were to try their 
<A NAME="635"></A>speed at sunrise, he entered, with many charioteers. One was an Achaean, 
<A NAME="636"></A>one from Sparta, two masters of yoked cars were Libyans; Orestes, driving 
<A NAME="637"></A>Thessalian mares, came fifth among them; the sixth from Aetolia, with chestnut 
<A NAME="638"></A>colts; a Magnesian was the seventh; the eighth, with white horses, was 
<A NAME="639"></A>of Aenian stock; the ninth, from Athens, built of gods; there was a Boeotian 
<A NAME="640"></A>too, making the tenth chariot.
<A NAME="641"></A><BR><BR>They took their stations where the appointed umpires placed them 
<A NAME="642"></A>by lot and ranged the cars; then, at the sound of the brazen trump, they 
<A NAME="643"></A>started. All shouted to their horses, and shook the reins in their hands; 
<A NAME="644"></A>the whole course was filled with the noise of rattling chariots; the dust 
<A NAME="645"></A>flew upward; and all, in a confused throng, plied their goads unsparingly, 
<A NAME="646"></A>each of them striving to pass the wheels and the snorting steeds of his 
<A NAME="647"></A>rivals; for alike at their backs and at their rolling wheels the breath 
<A NAME="648"></A>of the horses foamed and smote.
<A NAME="649"></A><BR><BR>Orestes, driving close to the pillar at either end of the course, 
<A NAME="650"></A>almost grazed it with his wheel each time, and, giving rein to the trace-horse 
<A NAME="651"></A>on the right, checked the horse on the inner side. Hitherto, all the chariots 
<A NAME="652"></A>had escaped overthrow; but presently the Aenian's hard-mouthed colts ran 
<A NAME="653"></A>away, and, swerving, as they passed from the sixth into the seventh round, 
<A NAME="654"></A>dashed their foreheads against the team of the Barcaean. Other mishaps 
<A NAME="655"></A>followed the first, shock on shock and crash on crash, till the whole race-ground 
<A NAME="656"></A>of Crisa was strewn with the wreck of the chariots.
<A NAME="657"></A><BR><BR>Seeing this, the wary charioteer from Athens drew aside and paused, 
<A NAME="658"></A>allowing the billow of chariots, surging in mid course, to go by. Orestes 
<A NAME="659"></A>was driving last, keeping his horses behind,- for his trust was in the 
<A NAME="660"></A>end; but when he saw that the Athenian was alone left in, he sent a shrill 
<A NAME="661"></A>cry ringing through the ears of his swift colts, and gave chase. Team was 
<A NAME="662"></A>brought level with team, and so they raced,-first one man, then the other. 
<A NAME="663"></A>showing his head in front of the chariots.
<A NAME="664"></A><BR><BR>Hitherto the ill-fated Orestes had passed safely through every 
<A NAME="665"></A>round, steadfast in his steadfast car; at last, slackening his left rein 
<A NAME="666"></A>while the horse was turning, unawares he struck the edge of the pillar; 
<A NAME="667"></A>he broke the axle-box in twain; he was thrown over the chariot-rail; he 
<A NAME="668"></A>was caught in the shapely reins; and, as he fell on the ground, his colts 
<A NAME="669"></A>were scattered into the middle of the course.
<A NAME="670"></A><BR><BR>But when the people saw him fallen from the car, a cry of pity 
<A NAME="671"></A>went up for the youth, who had done such deeds and was meeting such a doom,- 
<A NAME="672"></A>now dashed to earth, now tossed feet uppermost to the sky,- till the charioteers, 
<A NAME="673"></A>with difficulty checking the career of his horses, loosed him, so covered 
<A NAME="674"></A>with blood that no friend who saw it would have known the hapless corpse. 
<A NAME="675"></A>Straightway they burned it on a pyre; and chosen men of Phocis are bringing 
<A NAME="676"></A>in a small urn of bronze the sad dust of that mighty form, to find due 
<A NAME="677"></A>burial in his fatherland.
<A NAME="678"></A><BR><BR>Such is my story,- grievous to hear, if words can grieve; but for 
<A NAME="679"></A>us, who beheld, the greatest of sorrows that these eyes have seen.

<A NAME="850"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Well, thou shalt hear all that I have seen. When I came to 
<A NAME="851"></A>our father's ancient tomb, I saw that streams of milk had lately flowed 
<A NAME="852"></A>from the top of the mound, and that his sepulchre was encircled with garlands 
<A NAME="853"></A>of all flowers that blow. I was astonished at the sight, and peered about, 
<A NAME="854"></A>lest haply some one should be close to my side. But when I perceived that 
<A NAME="855"></A>all the place was in stillness, I crept nearer to the tomb; and on the 
<A NAME="856"></A>mound's edge I saw a lock of hair, freshly severed.
<A NAME="857"></A><BR><BR>And the moment that I saw it, ah me, a familiar image rushed upon 
<A NAME="858"></A>my soul, telling me that there I beheld a token of him whom most I love, 
<A NAME="859"></A>Orestes. Then I took it in my hands, and uttered no ill-omened word, but 
<A NAME="860"></A>the tears of joy straightway filled mine eyes. And I know well, as knew 
<A NAME="861"></A>then, that this fair tribute has come from none but him. Whose part else 
<A NAME="862"></A>was that, save mine and thine? And I did it not, I know,- nor thou; how 
<A NAME="863"></A>shouldst thou?- when thou canst not leave this house, even to worship the 
<A NAME="864"></A>gods, but at thy peril. Nor, again, does our mother's heart incline to 
<A NAME="865"></A>do such deeds, nor could she have so done without our 
<A NAME="866"></A>knowledge.
<A NAME="867"></A><BR><BR>No, these offerings are from Orestes! Come, dear sister, courage!

<A NAME="929"></A>that children should spring from thee or me for his own sure destruction. 
<A NAME="930"></A>But if thou wilt follow my counsels, first thou wilt win praise of piety 
<A NAME="931"></A>from our dead sire below, and from our brother too; next, thou shalt be

<A NAME="1119"></A>the from death; that so thou mightest have been stricken down on that self-same 
<A NAME="1120"></A>day, and had thy portion in the tomb of thy sire!
<A NAME="1121"></A><BR><BR>But now, an exile from home and fatherland, thou hast perished

<A NAME="1123"></A>washed or decked thy corpse, nor taken up, as was meet, their sad burden 
<A NAME="1124"></A>from the flaming pyre. No! at the hands of strangers, hapless one, thou

<BLOCKQUOTE>Spare all superfluous words; tell me not of our mother's
wickedness, or how Aegisthus drains the wealth of our father's house
by lavish luxury or aimless waste; for the story would not suffer
thee to keep due limit. Tell me rather that which will serve our present
need,- where we must show ourselves, or wait in ambush, that this
our coming may confound the triumph of our foes. 

And look that our mother read not thy secret in thy radiant face,
when we twain have advanced into the house, but make lament, as for
the feigned disaster; for when we have prospered, then there will
be leisure to rejoice and exult in freedom. 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>ELECTRA</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Nay, brother, as it pleases thee, so shall be my conduct
also; for all my joy is a gift from thee, and not mine own. Nor would
I consent to win great good for myself at the cost of the least pain
to thee; for so should I ill serve the divine power that befriends
us now. 

But thou knowest how matters stand here, I doubt not: thou must have
beard that Aegisthus is from home, but our mother within;- and fear
not that she will ever see my face lit up with smiles; for mine old
hatred of her hath sunk into my heart; and, since I have beheld thee,
for very joy I shall never cease to weep. How indeed should I cease,
who have seen thee come home this day, first as dead, and then in
life? Strangely hast thou wrought on me; so that, if my father should
return alive, I should no longer doubt my senses, but should believe
that I saw him. Now, therefore, that thou hast come to me so wondrously,
command me as thou wilt; for, had I been alone, I should have achieved
one of two things,- a noble deliverance, or a noble death.

no more.  <BR><I>ELECTRA enters from the palace.</I><BR>  

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>ELECTRA</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BR><I>strophe</I><BR>

Ah, dearest friends, in a moment the men will do the deed;- but wait
in silence. 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>CHORUS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>How is it?- what do they now? 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>ELECTRA</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>She is decking the urn for burial, and those two stand close
to her 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>CHORUS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And why hast thou sped forth? 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>ELECTRA</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To guard against Aegisthus entering before we are aware.

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>CLYTEMNESTRA</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <BR><I>within</I><BR> Alas! Woe for the house forsaken of friends
and filled with murderers! 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>ELECTRA</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A cry goes up within:- hear ye not, friends? 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>CHORUS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I heard, ah me, sounds dire to hear, and shuddered!

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>CLYTEMNESTRA</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <BR><I>within</I><BR> O hapless that I am!- Aegisthus, where, where
art thou? 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>ELECTRA</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Hark, once more a voice resounds I 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>CLYTEMNESTRA</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <BR><I>within</I><BR> My son, my son, have pity on thy mother!

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>ELECTRA</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Thou hadst none for him, nor for the father that begat him.

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>CHORUS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Ill-fated realm and race, now the fate that hath pursued thee
day by day is dying,- is dying! 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>CLYTEMNESTRA</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <BR><I>within</I><BR> Oh, I am smitten! 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>ELECTRA</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Smite, if thou canst, once more! 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>CLYTEMNESTRA</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <BR><I>within</I><BR> Ah, woe is me again! 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>ELECTRA</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Would that the woe were for Aegisthus too! 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>CHORUS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The curses are at work; the buried live; blood flows for blood,
drained from the slayers by those who died of yore.  <BR><I>ORESTES and
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>PYLADES</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>enter from the palace., antistrophe</I><BR>

Behold, they come! That red hand reeks with sacrifice to Ares; nor
can I blame the deed. 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>ELECTRA</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Orestes, how fare ye? 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>ORESTES</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>All is well within the house, if Apollo's oracle spake well.

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>ELECTRA</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The guilty one is dead? 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>ORESTES</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Fear no more that thy proud mother will ever put thee to
dishonour. 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>CHORUS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Cease; for I see Aegisthus full in view. 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>ELECTRA</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Rash boys, back, back! 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>ORESTES</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Where see ye the man? 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>ELECTRA</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Yonder, at our mercy, be advances from the suburb, full of
joy. 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>CHORUS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Make with all speed for the vestibule; that, as your first
task prospered. so this again may prosper now. 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>ORESTES</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Fear not,- we will perform it. 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>ELECTRA</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Haste, then, whither thou wouldst. 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>ORESTES</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>See, I am gone. 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>ELECTRA</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I will look to matters here.  <BR><I>ORESTES and PYLADES go back
into the palace.</I><BR>  

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>CHORUS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>'Twere well to soothe his ear with some few words of seeming
gentleness, that he may rush blindly upon the struggle with his doom.
<BR><I>AEGISTHUS enters.</I><BR>  

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>AEGISTHUS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Which of you can tell me, where are those Phocian strangers,
who, 'tis said, have brought us tidings of Orestes slain in the wreck
of his chariot? Thee, thee I ask, yes, thee, in former days so bold,-
for methinks it touches thee most nearly; thou best must know, and
best canst tell. 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>ELECTRA</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I know assuredly; else were I a stranger to the fortune of
my nearest kinsfolk. 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>AEGISTHUS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Where then may be the strangers? Tell me. 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>ELECTRA</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Within; they have found a way to the heart of their hostess.

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>AEGISTHUS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Have they in truth reported him dead? 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>ELECTRA</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Nay, not reported only; they have shown him. 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>AEGISTHUS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Can I, then, see the corpse with mine own eyes?

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>ELECTRA</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Thou canst, indeed; and 'tis no enviable sight.

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>AEGISTHUS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Indeed, thou hast given me a joyful greeting, beyond thy
wont. 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>ELECTRA</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Joy be thine, if in these things thou findest joy.

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>AEGISTHUS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Silence, I say, and throw wide the gates, for all Mycenaeans
and Argives to behold; that, if any of them were once buoyed on empty
hopes from this man, now, seeing him dead, they may receive my curb,
instead of waiting till my chastisement make them wise perforce!

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>ELECTRA</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No loyalty is lacking on my part; time hath taught me the
prudence of concord with the stronger.  <BR><I>The central doors of the
palace are thrown open and a shrouded corpse is disclosed. ORESTES
and PYLADES stand near it.</I><BR>  

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>AEGISTHUS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>O Zeus, I behold that which hath not fallen save by the
doom of jealous Heaven; but, if Nemesis attend that word, be it unsaid!

Take all the covering from the face, that kinship, at least, may receive
the tribute of lament from me also. 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>ORESTES</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Lift the veil thyself; not my part this, but thine, to look
upon these relics, and to greet them kindly. 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>AEGISTHUS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>'Tis good counsel, and I will follow it.-   <BR><I>To ELECTRA</I><BR>
But thou-call me Clytemnestra, if she is within. 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>ORESTES</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Lo, she is near thee: turn not thine eyes elsewhere.  <BR><I>AEGISTHUS
removes the face-cloth from the corpse.</I><BR>  

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>AEGISTHUS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>O, what sight is this! 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>ORESTES</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Why so scared? Is the face so strange? 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>AEGISTHUS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Who are the men into whose mid toils I have fallen, hapless
that I am? 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>ORESTES</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Nay, hast thou not discovered ere now that the dead, as thou
miscallest them, are living? 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>AEGISTHUS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Alas, I read the riddle: this can be none but Orestes who
speaks to me! 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>ORESTES</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And, though so good a prophet, thou wast deceived so long?

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>AEGISTHUS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Oh lost, undone! Yet suffer me to say one word...

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>ELECTRA</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In heaven's name, my brother, suffer him not to speak further,
or to plead at length! When mortals are in the meshes of fate, how
can such respite avail one who is to die? No,- slay him forthwith,
and cast his corpse to the creatures from whom such as he should have
burial, far from our sight! To me, nothing but this can make amends
for the woes of the past. 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>ORESTES</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <BR><I>to AEGISTHUS</I><BR> Go in, and quickly; the issue here is not
of words, but of thy life. 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>AEGISTHUS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Why take me into the house? If this deed be fair, what
need of darkness? Why is thy hand not prompt to strike? 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>ORESTES</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Dictate not, but go where thou didst slay my father, that
in the same place thou mayest die. 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>AEGISTHUS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Is this dwelling doomed to see all woes of Pelops' line,
now, and in time to come? 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>ORESTES</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Thine, at least; trust my prophetic skill so far.

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>AEGISTHUS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The skill thou vauntest belonged not to thy sire.

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>ORESTES</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Thou bandiest words, and our going is delayed. Move forward!

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>AEGISTHUS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Lead thou. 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>ORESTES</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Thou must go first. 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>AEGISTHUS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Lest I escape thee? 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>ORESTES</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No, but that thou mayest not choose how to die; I must not
spare thee any bitterness of death. And well it were if this judgment
came straight-way upon all who dealt in lawless deeds, even the judgment
of the sword: so should not wickedness abound.  <BR><I>ORESTES and PYLADES
drive AEGISTHUS into the palace.</I><BR>  

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>CHORUS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <BR><I>singing</I><BR> O house of Atreus, through how many sufferings
hast thou come forth at last in freedom, crowned with good by this
day's enterprise! 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>THE END</B>
