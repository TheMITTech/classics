<A NAME="20"></A><B>DEIANEIRA</B>
<A NAME="21"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>There is a saying among men, put forth of old, that thou canst 
<A NAME="22"></A>not rightly judge whether a mortal's lot is good or evil, ere he die. But 
<A NAME="23"></A>I, even before I have passed to the world of death, know well that my life 
<A NAME="24"></A>is sorrowful and bitter; I, who in the house of my father Oeneus, while 
<A NAME="25"></A>yet I dwelt at Pleuron, had such fear of bridals as never vexed any maiden 
<A NAME="26"></A>of Aetolia. For my wooer was a river-god, Achelous, who in three shapes 
<A NAME="27"></A>was ever asking me from my sire,- coming now as a bull in bodily form, 
<A NAME="28"></A>now as serpent with sheeny coils, now with trunk of man and front of ox, 
<A NAME="29"></A>while from a shaggy beard the streams of fountain-water flowed abroad. 
<A NAME="30"></A>With the fear of such a suitor before mine eyes, I was always praying in 
<A NAME="31"></A>my wretchedness that I might die, or ever I should come near to such a 
<A NAME="32"></A>bed.
<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR>But at last, to my joy, came the glorious son of Zeus and Alcmena; 
<A NAME="34"></A>who dosed with him in combat, and delivered me. How the fight was waged, 
<A NAME="35"></A>I cannot clearly tell, I know not; if there be any one who watched that 
<A NAME="36"></A>sight without terror, such might speak: I, as I sat there, was distraught 
<A NAME="37"></A>with dread, lest beauty should bring me sorrow at the last. But finally 
<A NAME="38"></A>the Zeus of battles ordained well,- if well indeed it be: for since I have 
<A NAME="39"></A>been joined to Heracles as his chosen bride, fear after fear hath haunted 
<A NAME="40"></A>me on his account; one night brings a trouble, and the next night, in turn, 
<A NAME="41"></A>drives it out. And then children were born to us; whom he has seen only 
<A NAME="42"></A>as the husbandman sees his distant field, which he visits at seedtime, 
<A NAME="43"></A>and once again at harvest. Such was the life that kept him journeying to 
<A NAME="44"></A>and fro, in the service of a certain master.
<A NAME="45"></A><BR><BR>But now, when he hath risen above those trials,- now it is that 
<A NAME="46"></A>my anguish is sorest. Ever since he slew the valiant Iphitus, we have been 
<A NAME="47"></A>dwelling here in Trachis, exiles from our home, and the guests of stranger; 
<A NAME="48"></A>but where he is, no one knows; I only know that he is gone, and hath pierced 
<A NAME="49"></A>my heart with cruel pangs for him. I am almost sure that some evil hath 
<A NAME="50"></A>befallen him; it is no short space that hath passed, but ten long months, 
<A NAME="51"></A>and then five more,- and still no message from him. Yes, there has been 
<A NAME="52"></A>some dread mischance;- witness that tablet which he left with me ere he 
<A NAME="53"></A>went forth: oft do I pray to the gods that I may not have received it for 
<A NAME="54"></A>my sorrow. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="55"></A><B>NURSE</B>
<A NAME="56"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Deianeira, my mistress, many a time have I marked thy bitter 
<A NAME="57"></A>tears and lamentations, as thou bewailedst the going forth of Heracles; 
<A NAME="58"></A>but now,- if it be meet to school the free-born with the counsels of a 
<A NAME="59"></A>slave, and if I must say what behoves thee,- why, when thou art so rich 
<A NAME="60"></A>in sons, dost thou send no one of them to seek thy lord;- Hyllus, before 
<A NAME="61"></A>all, who might well go on that errand, if he cared that there should be 
<A NAME="62"></A>tidings of his father's welfare? Lo! there he comes, speeding towards the 
<A NAME="63"></A>house with timely step; if, then, thou deemest that I speak in season, 
<A NAME="64"></A>thou canst use at once my counsel, and the man. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="65"></A><I>HYLLUS comes in from the side.</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="66"></A><B>DEIANEIRA</B>
<A NAME="67"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>My child, my son, wise words may fall, it seems, from humble 
<A NAME="68"></A>lips; this woman is a slave, but hath spoken in the spirit of the free. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="69"></A><B>HYLLUS</B>
<A NAME="70"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>How, mother? Tell me, if it may be told. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="71"></A><B>DEIANEIRA</B>
<A NAME="72"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>It brings thee shame, she saith, that, when thy father hath 
<A NAME="73"></A>been so long a stranger, thou hast not sought to learn where he is. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="74"></A><B>HYLLUS</B>
<A NAME="75"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Nay, I know,- if rumour can be trusted. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="76"></A><B>DEIANEIRA</B>
<A NAME="77"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>And in what region, my child, doth rumour place him? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="78"></A><B>HYLLUS</B>
<A NAME="79"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Last year, they say, through all the months, he toiled as bondman 
<A NAME="80"></A>to Lydian woman. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="81"></A><B>DEIANEIRA</B>
<A NAME="82"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>If he bore that, then no tidings can surprise. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="83"></A><B>HYLLUS</B>
<A NAME="84"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Well, he has been delivered from that, as I hear. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="85"></A><B>DEIANEIRA</B>
<A NAME="86"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Where, then, is he reported to be now,- alive or dead? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="87"></A><B>HYLLUS</B>
<A NAME="88"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>He is waging or planning a war, they say, upon Euboea, the 
<A NAME="89"></A>realm of Eurytus. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="90"></A><B>DEIANEIRA</B>
<A NAME="91"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Knowest thou, my son, that he hath left with me sure oracles 
<A NAME="92"></A>touching that land? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="93"></A><B>HYLLUS</B>
<A NAME="94"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>What are they, mother? I know not whereof thou speakest. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="95"></A><B>DEIANEIRA</B>
<A NAME="96"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>That either he shall meet his death, or, having achieved this 
<A NAME="97"></A>task, shall have rest thenceforth, for all his days to 
<A NAME="98"></A>come.
<A NAME="99"></A><BR><BR>So, my child, when his fate is thus trembling in the scale, wilt 
<A NAME="100"></A>thou not go to succour him? For we are saved, if he find safety, or we 
<A NAME="101"></A>perish with him. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="102"></A><B>HYLLUS</B>
<A NAME="103"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Ay, I will go, my mother; and, had I known the import of these 
<A NAME="104"></A>prophecies, I had been there long since; but, as it was, my father's wonted 
<A NAME="105"></A>fortune suffered me not to feel fear for him, or to be anxious overmuch. 
<A NAME="106"></A>Now that I have the knowledge, I will spare no pains to learn the whole 
<A NAME="107"></A>truth in this matter. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="108"></A><B>DEIANEIRA</B>
<A NAME="109"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Go, then, my son; be the seeker ne'er so late, he is rewarded 
<A NAME="110"></A>if he learn tidings of joy. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="111"></A><I>HYLLUS departs as the CHORUS OF TRACHINIAN MAIDENS enters. They are 
<A NAME="112"></A>free-born young women of Trachis who are friends and confidantes of DEIANEIRA. 
<A NAME="113"></A>She remains during their opening choral song.</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="114"></A><B>CHORUS  </B>
<A NAME="115"></A><I>singing</I><BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="116"></A><I>strophe 1</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="117"></A>Thou whom Night brings forth at the moment when she is despoiled of her 
<A NAME="118"></A>starry crown, and lays to rest in thy splendour, tell me, pray thee, O 
<A NAME="119"></A>Sun-god, tell me where abides Alcmena's son? Thou glorious lord of flashing 
<A NAME="120"></A>light, say, is he threading the straits of the sea, or hath he found an 
<A NAME="121"></A>abode on either continent? Speak, thou who seest as none else can see! 
<A NAME="122"></A><BR><BR><I>antistrophe 1</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="123"></A>For Deianeira, as I hear, hath ever an aching heart; she, the battle-prize 
<A NAME="124"></A>of old, is now like some bird lorn of its mate; she can never lull her 
<A NAME="125"></A>yearning, nor stay her tears; haunted by a sleepless fear for her absent 
<A NAME="126"></A>lord, she pines on her anxious, widowed couch, miserable in her foreboding 
<A NAME="127"></A>of mischance. <BR><BR><I>strophe 2</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="128"></A>As one may see billow after billow driven over the wide deep by the tireless 
<A NAME="129"></A>south-wind or the north, so the trouble of his life, stormy as the Cretan 
<A NAME="130"></A>sea, now whirls back the son of Cadmus, now lifts him to honour. But some 
<A NAME="131"></A>god ever saves him from the house of death, and suffers him not to fail. 
<A NAME="132"></A><BR><BR><I>antistrophe 2</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="133"></A>Lady, I praise not this thy mood; with all reverence will I speak, yet 
<A NAME="134"></A>in reproof. Thou dost not well, I say, to kill fair hope by fretting; remember 
<A NAME="135"></A>that the son of Cronus himself, the all-disposing king, hath not appointed 
<A NAME="136"></A>a painless lot for mortals. Sorrow and joy come round to all, as the Bear 
<A NAME="137"></A>moves in his circling paths. <BR><BR><I>epode</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="138"></A>Yea, starry night abides not with men, nor tribulation, nor wealth; in 
<A NAME="139"></A>a moment it is gone from us, and another hath his turn of gladness, and 
<A NAME="140"></A>of bereavement. So would I wish thee also, the Queen, to keep that prospect 
<A NAME="141"></A>ever in thy thoughts; for when hath Zeus been found so careless of his 
<A NAME="142"></A>children? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="143"></A><B>DEIANEIRA</B>
<A NAME="144"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Ye have heard of my trouble, I think, and that hath brought 
<A NAME="145"></A>you here; but the anguish which consumes my heart- ye are strangers to 
<A NAME="146"></A>that; and never may ye learn it by suffering! Yes, the tender plant grows 
<A NAME="147"></A>in those sheltered regions of its own! and the Sun-god's heat vexes it 
<A NAME="148"></A>not, nor rain, nor any wind; but it rejoices in its sweet, untroubled being, 
<A NAME="149"></A>til such time as the maiden is called a wife, and finds her portion of 
<A NAME="150"></A>anxious thoughts in the night, brooding on danger to husband or to children. 
<A NAME="151"></A>Such an one could understand the burden of my cares; she could judge them 
<A NAME="152"></A>by her own.
<A NAME="153"></A><BR><BR>Well, I have had many a sorrow to weep for ere now; but I am going 
<A NAME="154"></A>to speak of one more grievous than them all.
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR>When Heracles my lord was going from home on his last journey, 
<A NAME="156"></A>he left in the house an ancient tablet, inscribed with tokens which he 
<A NAME="157"></A>had never brought himself to explain to me before, many as were the ordeals 
<A NAME="158"></A>to which he had gone forth. He had always departed as if to conquer, not 
<A NAME="159"></A>to die. But now, as if he were a doomed man, he told me what portion of 
<A NAME="160"></A>his substance I was to take for my dower, and how he would have his sons 
<A NAME="161"></A>share their father's land amongst them. And he fixed the time; saying that, 
<A NAME="162"></A>when a year and three months should have passed since he had left the country, 
<A NAME="163"></A>then he was fated to die; or, if he should have survived that term, to 
<A NAME="164"></A>live thenceforth an untroubled life.
<A NAME="165"></A><BR><BR>Such, he said, was the doom ordained by the gods to be accomplished 
<A NAME="166"></A>in the toils of Heracles; as the ancient oak at Dodona had spoken of yore, 
<A NAME="167"></A>by the mouth of the two Peleiades. And this is the precise moment when 
<A NAME="168"></A>the fulfilment of that word becomes due; so that I start up from sweet 
<A NAME="169"></A>slumber, my friends, stricken with terror at the thought that I must remain 
<A NAME="170"></A>widowed of the noblest among men. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="171"></A><B>LEADER OF THE CHORUS</B>
<A NAME="172"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Hush- no more ill-omened words; I see a man approaching, who 
<A NAME="173"></A>wears a wreath, as if for joyous tidings. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="174"></A><I>A MESSENGER enters.</I>

<A NAME="175"></A><B>MESSENGER</B>
<A NAME="176"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Queen Deianeira, I shall be the first of messengers to free 
<A NAME="177"></A>thee from fear. Know that Alcmena's son lives and triumphs, and from battle 
<A NAME="178"></A>brings the first-fruits to the gods of this land. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="179"></A><B>DEIANEIRA</B>
<A NAME="180"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>What news is this, old man, that thou hast told me? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="181"></A><B>MESSENGER</B>
<A NAME="182"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>That thy lord, admired of all, will soon come to thy house,

<A NAME="186"></A><B>MESSENGER</B>
<A NAME="187"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>In the meadow, summer haunt of oxen, Lichas the herald is proclaiming 
<A NAME="188"></A>it to many: from him I heard it, and flew hither, that I might be the first 
<A NAME="189"></A>to give thee these tidings, and so might reap some guerdon from thee, and 
<A NAME="190"></A>win thy grace. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="191"></A><B>DEIANEIRA</B>
<A NAME="192"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>And why is he not here, if he brings good news? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="193"></A><B>MESSENGER</B>
<A NAME="194"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>His task, lady, is no easy one; all the Malian folk have thronged 
<A NAME="195"></A>around him with questions, and he cannot move forward: each and all are 
<A NAME="196"></A>bent on learning what they desire, and will not release him until they 
<A NAME="197"></A>are satisfied. Thus their eagerness detains him against his will; but thou 
<A NAME="198"></A>shalt presently see him face to face. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="199"></A><B>DEIANEIRA</B>
<A NAME="200"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>O Zeus, who rulest the meads of Oeta, sacred from the scythe, 
<A NAME="201"></A>at last, though late, thou hast given us joy! Uplift your voices, ye women 
<A NAME="202"></A>within the house and ye beyond our gates, since now we are gladdened by

<A NAME="257"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Not so: the greater part of the time he was detained in Lydia,- 
<A NAME="258"></A>no free man, as he declares, but sold into bondage. No offence should attend 
<A NAME="259"></A>on the word, lady, when the deed is found to be of Zeus. So he passed a 
<A NAME="260"></A>whole year, as he himself avows, in thraldom to Omphale the barbarian. 
<A NAME="261"></A>And so stung was he by that reproach, he bound himself by a solemn oath 
<A NAME="262"></A>that he would one day enslave, with wife and child, the man who had brought 
<A NAME="263"></A>that calamity upon him. Nor did he speak the word in vain; but, when he 
<A NAME="264"></A>bad been purged, gathered an alien host, and went against the city of Eurytus. 
<A NAME="265"></A>That man, he said, alone of mortals, had a share in causing his misfortune. 
<A NAME="266"></A>For when Heracles, an old friend, came to his house and hearth, Eurytus 
<A NAME="267"></A>heaped on him the taunts of a bitter tongue and spiteful soul,- saying, 
<A NAME="268"></A>'Thou hast unerring arrows in thy hands, and yet my sons surpass thee in 
<A NAME="269"></A>the trial of archery'; 'Thou art a slave,' he cried, 'a free man's broken 
<A NAME="270"></A>thrall': and at a banquet, when his guest was full of wine, he thrust him 
<A NAME="271"></A>from his doors.
<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR>Wroth thereat, when afterward Iphitus came to the hill of Tiryns, 
<A NAME="273"></A>in search for horses that had strayed, Heracles seized a moment when the 
<A NAME="274"></A>man's wandering thoughts went not with his wandering gaze, and hurled him 
<A NAME="275"></A>from a tower-like summit. But in anger at that deed, Zeus our lord, Olympian 
<A NAME="276"></A>sire of all, sent him forth into bondage, and spared not, because, this 
<A NAME="277"></A>once, he had taken a life by guile. Had he wreaked his vengeance openly, 
<A NAME="278"></A>Zeus would surely have pardoned him the righteous triumph; for the gods, 
<A NAME="279"></A>too, love not insolence.
<A NAME="280"></A><BR><BR>So those men, who waxed so proud with bitter speech, are themselves 
<A NAME="281"></A>in the mansions of the dead, all of them, and their city is enslaved; while 
<A NAME="282"></A>the women whom thou beholdest, fallen from happiness to misery, come here 
<A NAME="283"></A>to thee; for such was thy lord's command, which I, his faithful servant,

<A NAME="540"></A>that entered the contest for her hand? Who went forth to the ordeal of 
<A NAME="541"></A>battle, to the fierce blows and the blinding dust? <BR><BR><I>antistrophe</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="542"></A>One was a mighty river-god, the dread form of a horned and four-legged 
<A NAME="543"></A>bull, Achelous, from Oeniadae: the other came from Thebe, dear to Bacchus, 
<A NAME="544"></A>with curved bow, and spears, and brandished club, the son of Zeus: who 
<A NAME="545"></A>then met in combat, fain to win a bride: and the Cyprian goddess of nuptial 
<A NAME="546"></A>joy was there with them, sole umpire of their strife. 
<A NAME="547"></A><BR><BR><I>epode</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="548"></A>Then was there clatter of fists and clang of bow, and the noise of bull's 
<A NAME="549"></A>horns therewith; then were there close-locked grapplings, and deadly blows 
<A NAME="550"></A>from the forehead, and loud deep cries from both.
<A NAME="551"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile, she, in her delicate beauty, sat on the side of a hill 
<A NAME="552"></A>that could be seen afar, awaiting the husband that should be 
<A NAME="553"></A>hers.
<A NAME="554"></A><BR><BR>So the battle rages, as I have told; but the fair bride who is 
<A NAME="555"></A>the prize of the strife abides the end in piteous anguish. And suddenly 
<A NAME="556"></A>she is parted from her mother, as when a heifer is taken from its dam.

<A NAME="559"></A><B>DEIANEIRA</B>
<A NAME="560"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Dear friends, while our visitor is saying his farewell to the 
<A NAME="561"></A>captive girls in the house, I have stolen forth to you,- partly to tell 
<A NAME="562"></A>you what these hands have devised, and partly to crave your sympathy with 
<A NAME="563"></A>my sorrow.
<A NAME="564"></A><BR><BR>A maiden,- or, methinks, no longer a maiden, but a mistress,- hath 
<A NAME="565"></A>found her way into my house, as a freight comes to a mariner,- a merchandise 
<A NAME="566"></A>to make shipwreck of my peace. And now we twain are to share the same marriage-bed, 
<A NAME="567"></A>the same embrace. Such is the reward that Heracles hath sent me,- he whom 
<A NAME="568"></A>I called true and loyal,- for guarding his home through all that weary 
<A NAME="569"></A>time. I have no thought of anger against him, often as he is vexed with 
<A NAME="570"></A>this distemper. But then to live with her, sharing the same union- what 
<A NAME="571"></A>woman could endure it? For I see that the flower of her age is blossoming, 
<A NAME="572"></A>while mine is fading; and the eyes of men love to cull the bloom of youth, 
<A NAME="573"></A>but they turn aside from the old. This, then, is my fear,- lest Heracles, 
<A NAME="574"></A>in name my spouse, should be the younger's mate.
<A NAME="575"></A><BR><BR>But, as I said, anger ill beseems a woman of understanding. I will 
<A NAME="576"></A>tell you, friends, the way by which I hope to find deliverance and relief. 
<A NAME="577"></A>I had a gift, given to me long ago by a monster of olden time, aid stored 
<A NAME="578"></A>in an urn of bronze; a gift which, while yet a girl, I took up from the 
<A NAME="579"></A>shaggy-breasted Nessus,- from his life-blood, as he lay dying; Nessus, 
<A NAME="580"></A>who used to carry men in his arms across the deep waters of the Evenus, 
<A NAME="581"></A>using no oar to waft them, nor sail of ship.
<A NAME="582"></A><BR><BR>I, too, was carried on his shoulders,- when, by my father's sending, 
<A NAME="583"></A>first went forth with Heracles as his wife; and when I was in mid-stream, 
<A NAME="584"></A>he touched me with wanton hands. I shrieked; the son of Zeus turned quickly 
<A NAME="585"></A>round, and shot a feathered arrow; it whizzed through his breast to the 
<A NAME="586"></A>lungs; and, in his mortal faintness, thus much the Centaur 
<A NAME="587"></A>spake:-
<A NAME="588"></A><BR><BR>'Child of aged Oeneus, thou shalt have at least this profit of 
<A NAME="589"></A>my ferrying,- if thou wilt hearken,-because thou wast the last whom I conveyed. 
<A NAME="590"></A>If thou gatherest with thy hands the blood clotted round my wound, at the 
<A NAME="591"></A>place where the Hydra, Lerna's monstrous growth, hath tinged the arrow 
<A NAME="592"></A>with black gall,- this shall be to thee a charm for the soul of Heracles, 
<A NAME="593"></A>so that he shall never look upon any woman to love her more than 
<A NAME="594"></A>thee.'
<A NAME="595"></A><BR><BR>I bethought me of this, my friends- for, after his death, I had 
<A NAME="596"></A>kept it carefully locked up in a secret place; and I have anointed this 
<A NAME="597"></A>robe, doing everything to it as he enjoined while he lived. The work is 
<A NAME="598"></A>finished. May deeds of wicked daring be ever far from my thoughts, and 
<A NAME="599"></A>from my knowledge,- as I abhor the women who attempt them! But if in any 
<A NAME="600"></A>wise I may prevail against this girl by love-spells and charms used on 
<A NAME="601"></A>Heracles, the means to that end are ready;-unless, indeed, I seem to be 
<A NAME="602"></A>acting rashly: if so, I will desist forthwith. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<A NAME="626"></A><BR><BR>And when thou givest it, charge him that he, and no other, shall

<A NAME="629"></A>stand forth, conspicuous before all eyes, and show it to the gods on a

<A NAME="631"></A><BR><BR>For thus had I vowed,- that if I should ever see or hear that he 
<A NAME="632"></A>had come safely home, I would duly clothe him in this robe, and so present

<A NAME="635"></A><BR><BR>As proof, thou shalt carry a token, which he will quickly recognise

<A NAME="699"></A><B>DEIANEIRA</B>
<A NAME="700"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>A thing hath come to pass, my friends, such that, if I declare 
<A NAME="701"></A>it, ye will hear a marvel whereof none could have dreamed.
<A NAME="702"></A><BR><BR>That with which I was lately anointing the festal robe,- a white 
<A NAME="703"></A>tuft of fleecy sheep's wool,- hath disappeared,- not consumed by anything 
<A NAME="704"></A>in the house, but self-devoured and self-destroyed, as it crumbled down 
<A NAME="705"></A>from the surface of a stone. But I must tell the story More at length, 
<A NAME="706"></A>that thou mayest know exactly how this thing befell.
<A NAME="707"></A><BR><BR>I neglected no part of the precepts which the savage Centaur gave 
<A NAME="708"></A>me, when the bitter barb was rankling in his side: they were in my memory, 
<A NAME="709"></A>like the graven words which no hand may wash from a tablet of bronze. Now 
<A NAME="710"></A>these were his orders, and I obeyed them:-to keep this unguent in secret 
<A NAME="711"></A>place, always remote from fire and from the sun's warm ray, until I should 
<A NAME="712"></A>apply it, newly spread, where I wished. So had I done. And now, when the 
<A NAME="713"></A>moment for action had come, I performed the anointing privily in the house, 
<A NAME="714"></A>with a tuft of soft wool which I had plucked from a sheep of our home-flock; 
<A NAME="715"></A>then I folded up my gift, and laid it, unvisited by sunlight, within its 
<A NAME="716"></A>casket, as ye saw.
<A NAME="717"></A><BR><BR>But as I was going back into the house, I beheld a thing too wondrous 
<A NAME="718"></A>for words, and passing the wit of man to understand. I happened to have 
<A NAME="719"></A>thrown the shred of wool, with which I bad been preparing the robe, into 
<A NAME="720"></A>the full blaze of the sunshine. As it grew warm, it shrivelled all away, 
<A NAME="721"></A>and quickly crumbled to powder on the ground, like nothing so much as the 
<A NAME="722"></A>dust shed from a saw's teeth where men work timber. In such a state it 
<A NAME="723"></A>lies as it fell. And from the earth, where it was strewn, clots of foam 
<A NAME="724"></A>seethed up, as when the rich juice of the blue fruit from the vine of Bacchus 
<A NAME="725"></A>is poured upon the ground.
<A NAME="726"></A><BR><BR>So I know not, hapless one, whither to turn my thoughts; I only 
<A NAME="727"></A>see that I have done a fearful deed. Why or wherefore should the monster, 
<A NAME="728"></A>in his death-throes, have shown good will to me, on whose account he was 
<A NAME="729"></A>dying? Impossible! No, he was cajoling me, in order to slay the man who 
<A NAME="730"></A>had smitten him: and I gain the knowledge of this too late, when it avails 
<A NAME="731"></A>no more. Yes, I alone- unless my foreboding prove false- I, wretched one, 
<A NAME="732"></A>must destroy him! For I know that the arrow which made the wound did scathe 
<A NAME="733"></A>even to the god Cheiron; and it kills all beasts that it touches. And since 
<A NAME="734"></A>'tis this same black venom in the blood that hath passed out through the 
<A NAME="735"></A>wound of Nessus, must it not kill my lord also? I ween it 
<A NAME="736"></A>must.
<A NAME="737"></A><BR><BR>Howbeit, I am resolved that, if he is to fall, at the same time 
<A NAME="738"></A>I also shall be swept from life; for no woman could bear to live with an 
<A NAME="739"></A>evil name, if she rejoices that her nature is not evil.

<A NAME="783"></A><BR>After sacking the famous town of Eurytus, he went his way with the 
<A NAME="784"></A>trophies and first-fruits of victory. There is a sea-washed headland of 
<A NAME="785"></A>Euboea, Cape Cenaeum, where he dedicated altars and a sacred grove to the 
<A NAME="786"></A>Zeus of his fathers; and there I first beheld him, with the joy of yearning 
<A NAME="787"></A>love.
<A NAME="788"></A><BR><BR>He was about to celebrate a great sacrifice, when his own herald, 
<A NAME="789"></A>Lichas, came to him from home, bearing thy gift, the deadly robe; which 
<A NAME="790"></A>he put on, according to thy precept; and then began his offering with twelve 
<A NAME="791"></A>bulls, free from blemish, the firstlings of the spoil; but altogether he 
<A NAME="792"></A>brought a hundred victims, great or small, to the altar.
<A NAME="793"></A><BR><BR>At first, hapless one, he prayed with serene soul, rejoicing in 
<A NAME="794"></A>his comely garb. But when the blood-fed flame began to blaze from the holy 
<A NAME="795"></A>offerings and from the resinous pine, a sweat broke forth upon his flesh, 
<A NAME="796"></A>and the tunic clung to his sides, at every joint, close-glued, as if by 
<A NAME="797"></A>a craftsman's hand; there came a biting pain that racked his bones; and 
<A NAME="798"></A>then the venom, as of some deadly, cruel viper, began to devour 
<A NAME="799"></A>him.
<A NAME="800"></A><BR><BR>Thereupon he shouted for the unhappy Lichas,- in no wise to blame 
<A NAME="801"></A>for thy crime,- asking what treason had moved him to bring that robe; but 
<A NAME="802"></A>he, all-unknowing, hapless one, said that he had brought the gift from 
<A NAME="803"></A>thee alone, as it had been sent. When his master heard it, as a piercing 
<A NAME="804"></A>spasm clutched his lungs, he caught him by the foot, where the ankle turns 
<A NAME="805"></A>in the socket, and hurled him at a surf-beaten rock in the sea; and he 
<A NAME="806"></A>made the white brain to ooze from the hair, as the skull was dashed to 
<A NAME="807"></A>splinters, and blood scattered therewith.
<A NAME="808"></A><BR><BR>But all the people lifted up a cry of awe-struck grief, seeing 
<A NAME="809"></A>that one was frenzied, and the other slain; and no one dared to come before 
<A NAME="810"></A>the man. For the pain dragged him to earth, or made him leap into the air, 
<A NAME="811"></A>with yells and shrieks, till the cliffs rang around, steep headlands of 
<A NAME="812"></A>Locris, and Euboean capes.
<A NAME="813"></A><BR><BR>But when he was spent with oft throwing himself on the ground in 
<A NAME="814"></A>his anguish, and oft making loud lament,- cursing his fatal marriage with 
<A NAME="815"></A>thee, the vile one, and his alliance with Oeneus,- saying how he had found 
<A NAME="816"></A>in it the ruin of his life,- then from out of the shrouding altar-smoke, 
<A NAME="817"></A>he lifted up his wildly-rolling eyes, and saw me in the great crowd, weeping. 
<A NAME="818"></A>He turned his gaze on me, and called me: 'O son, draw near; do not fly 
<A NAME="819"></A>from my trouble, even though thou must share my death. Come, bear me forth, 
<A NAME="820"></A>and set me, if thou canst, in a place where no man shall see me; or, if 
<A NAME="821"></A>thy pity forbids that, at least convey me with all speed out of this land, 
<A NAME="822"></A>and let me not die where I am.'
<A NAME="823"></A><BR><BR>That command sufficed; we laid him in mid-ship, and brought him-but 
<A NAME="824"></A>hardly brought him- to this shore, moaning in his torments. And ye shall 
<A NAME="825"></A>presently behold him, alive, or lately dead.
<A NAME="826"></A><BR><BR>Such, mother, are the designs and deeds against my sire whereof

<A NAME="945"></A><BR><BR>But when she ceased from this, suddenly I beheld her rush into

<A NAME="948"></A>done this, she sprang thereon, and sat in the middle of the bed; her tears 
<A NAME="949"></A>burst forth in burning streams, and thus she spake: 'Ah, bridal bed and 
<A NAME="950"></A>bridal chamber mine, farewell now and for ever; never more shall ye receive 
<A NAME="951"></A>me to rest upon this couch.' She said no more, but with a vehement hand 
<A NAME="952"></A>loosed her robe, where the gold-wrought brooch lay above her breast, baring 
<A NAME="953"></A>all her left side and arm. Then I ran with all my strength, and warned 
<A NAME="954"></A>her son of her intent. But lo, in the space between my going and our return, 
<A NAME="955"></A>she had driven a two-edged sword through her side to the

<A NAME="957"></A><BR><BR>At that sight, her son uttered a great cry; for he knew, alas,

<A NAME="960"></A>by the prompting of the Centaur. And now the youth, in his misery, bewailed 
<A NAME="961"></A>her with all passionate lament; he knelt, and showered kisses on her lips; 
<A NAME="962"></A>he threw himself at her side upon the ground, bitterly crying that he had 
<A NAME="963"></A>rashly smitten her with a slander,- weeping that he must now live bereaved

<A NAME="1161"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Nay, she thought to use a love-charm for thy heart, when she

<A NAME="1172"></A>all thy brethren; summon, too, the hapless Alcmena, in vain the bride of

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="1174"></A><B>HYLLUS</B>
<A NAME="1175"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Nay, thy mother is not here; as it chances, she hath her abode 
<A NAME="1176"></A>at Tiryns by the sea. Some of thy children she hath taken to live with 
<A NAME="1177"></A>her there, and others, thou wilt find, are dwelling in Thebe's town. But 
<A NAME="1178"></A>we who are with thee, my father, will render all service that is needed, 
<A NAME="1179"></A>at thy bidding. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="1180"></A><B>HERACLES</B>
<A NAME="1181"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Hear, then, thy task: now is the time to show what stuff is 
<A NAME="1182"></A>in thee, who art called my son.
<A NAME="1183"></A><BR><BR>It was foreshown to me by my Sire of old that I should perish by 
<A NAME="1184"></A>no creature that had the breath of life, but by one that had passed to 
<A NAME="1185"></A>dwell with Hades. So I have been slain by this savage Centaur, the living 
<A NAME="1186"></A>by the dead, even as the divine will had been foretold.
<A NAME="1187"></A><BR><BR>And I will show thee how later oracles tally therewith, confirming 
<A NAME="1188"></A>the old prophecy. I wrote them down in the grove of the Selli, dwellers 
<A NAME="1189"></A>on the hills, whose couch is on the ground; they were given by my Father's 
<A NAME="1190"></A>oak of many tongues; which said that, at the time which liveth and now 
<A NAME="1191"></A>is, my release from the toils laid upon me should be accomplished. And 
<A NAME="1192"></A>I looked for prosperous days; but the meaning, it seems, was only that 
<A NAME="1193"></A>should die; for toil comes no more to the dead.
<A NAME="1194"></A><BR><BR>Since, then, my son, those words are clearly finding their fulfilment, 
<A NAME="1195"></A>thou, on thy part, must lend me thine aid. Thou must not delay, and so 
<A NAME="1196"></A>provoke me to bitter speech: thou must consent and help with a good grace, 
<A NAME="1197"></A>as one who hath learned that best of laws, obedience to a sire. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="1225"></A><B>HERACLES</B>
<A NAME="1226"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Thither, then, thou must carry me up with thine own hands, 
<A NAME="1227"></A>aided by what friends thou wilt; thou shalt lop many a branch from the 
<A NAME="1228"></A>deep-rooted oak, and hew many a faggot also from the sturdy stock of the 
<A NAME="1229"></A>wild-olive; thou shalt lay my body thereupon, and kindle it with flaming 
<A NAME="1230"></A>pine-torch.
<A NAME="1231"></A><BR><BR>And let no tear of mourning be seen there; no, do this without 
<A NAME="1232"></A>lament and without weeping, if thou art indeed my son. But if thou do it 
<A NAME="1233"></A>not, even from the world below my curse and my wrath shall wait on thee

<A NAME="1238"></A><B>HERACLES</B>
<A NAME="1239"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I have spoken that which thou must perform; if thou wilt not,

<A NAME="1268"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Even so. This, in brief, is the charge that I give thee, my

<A NAME="1271"></A>no other espouse her who hath lain at my side, but do thou, O my son, make
