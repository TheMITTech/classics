The Porch of the King Archon.<BR></BLOCKQUOTE><HR SIZE="1" COLOR="990033" NOSHADE><BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="14"></A><BR><BR><B>Euthyphro.</B> Why have you left the Lyceum, Socrates? and what 
<A NAME="15"></A>are you doing in the Porch of the King Archon? Surely you cannot be concerned 
<A NAME="16"></A>in a suit before the King, like myself?
<A NAME="17"></A><BR><BR><B>Socrates.</B> Not in a suit, Euthyphro; impeachment is the word 
<A NAME="18"></A>which the Athenians use.
<A NAME="19"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> What! I suppose that some one has been prosecuting 
<A NAME="20"></A>you, for I cannot believe that you are the prosecutor of 
<A NAME="21"></A>another.
<A NAME="22"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Certainly not.
<A NAME="23"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Then some one else has been prosecuting 
<A NAME="24"></A>you?
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> And who is he?
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> A young man who is little known, Euthyphro; and I hardly 
<A NAME="28"></A>know him: his name is Meletus, and he is of the deme of Pitthis. Perhaps 
<A NAME="29"></A>you may remember his appearance; he has a beak, and long straight hair, 
<A NAME="30"></A>and a beard which is ill grown.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> No, I do not remember him, Socrates. But what is the 
<A NAME="32"></A>charge which he brings against you?
<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> What is the charge? Well, a very serious charge, which 
<A NAME="34"></A>shows a good deal of character in the young man, and for which he is certainly 
<A NAME="35"></A>not to be despised. He says he knows how the youth are corrupted and who 
<A NAME="36"></A>are their corruptors. I fancy that he must be a wise man, and seeing that 
<A NAME="37"></A>I am the reverse of a wise man, he has found me out, and is going to accuse 
<A NAME="38"></A>me of corrupting his young friends. And of this our mother the state is 
<A NAME="39"></A>to be the judge. Of all our political men he is the only one who seems 
<A NAME="40"></A>to me to begin in the right way, with the cultivation of virtue in youth; 
<A NAME="41"></A>like a good husbandman, he makes the young shoots his first care, and clears 
<A NAME="42"></A>away us who are the destroyers of them. This is only the first step; he 
<A NAME="43"></A>will afterwards attend to the elder branches; and if he goes on as he has 
<A NAME="44"></A>begun, he will be a very great public benefactor.
<A NAME="45"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> I hope that he may; but I rather fear, Socrates, that 
<A NAME="46"></A>the opposite will turn out to be the truth. My opinion is that in attacking 
<A NAME="47"></A>you he is simply aiming a blow at the foundation of the state. But in what 
<A NAME="48"></A>way does he say that you corrupt the young?
<A NAME="49"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> He brings a wonderful accusation against me, which 
<A NAME="50"></A>at first hearing excites surprise: he says that I am a poet or maker of 
<A NAME="51"></A>gods, and that I invent new gods and deny the existence of old ones; this 
<A NAME="52"></A>is the ground of his indictment.
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> I understand, Socrates; he means to attack you about 
<A NAME="54"></A>the familiar sign which occasionally, as you say, comes to you. He thinks 
<A NAME="55"></A>that you are a neologian, and he is going to have you up before the court 
<A NAME="56"></A>for this. He knows that such a charge is readily received by the world, 
<A NAME="57"></A>as I myself know too well; for when I speak in the assembly about divine 
<A NAME="58"></A>things, and foretell the future to them, they laugh at me and think me 
<A NAME="59"></A>a madman. Yet every word that I say is true. But they are jealous of us 
<A NAME="60"></A>all; and we must be brave and go at them.
<A NAME="61"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Their laughter, friend Euthyphro, is not a matter of 
<A NAME="62"></A>much consequence. For a man may be thought wise; but the Athenians, I suspect, 
<A NAME="63"></A>do not much trouble themselves about him until he begins to impart his 
<A NAME="64"></A>wisdom to others, and then for some reason or other, perhaps, as you say, 
<A NAME="65"></A>from jealousy, they are angry.
<A NAME="66"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> I am never likely to try their temper in this 
<A NAME="67"></A>way.
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I dare say not, for you are reserved in your behaviour, 
<A NAME="69"></A>and seldom impart your wisdom. But I have a benevolent habit of pouring 
<A NAME="70"></A>out myself to everybody, and would even pay for a listener, and I am afraid 
<A NAME="71"></A>that the Athenians may think me too talkative. Now if, as I was saying, 
<A NAME="72"></A>they would only laugh at me, as you say that they laugh at you, the time 
<A NAME="73"></A>might pass gaily enough in the court; but perhaps they may be in earnest, 
<A NAME="74"></A>and then what the end will be you soothsayers only can 
<A NAME="75"></A>predict.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> I dare say that the affair will end in nothing, Socrates, 
<A NAME="77"></A>and that you will win your cause; and I think that I shall win my 
<A NAME="78"></A>own.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And what is your suit, Euthyphro? are you the pursuer 
<A NAME="80"></A>or the defendant?
<A NAME="81"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> I am the pursuer.
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Of whom?
<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> You will think me mad when I tell 
<A NAME="84"></A>you.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Why, has the fugitive wings?
<A NAME="86"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Nay, he is not very volatile at his time of 
<A NAME="87"></A>life.
<A NAME="88"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Who is he?
<A NAME="89"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> My father.
<A NAME="90"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Your father! my good man?
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And of what is he accused?
<A NAME="93"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Of murder, Socrates.
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> By the powers, Euthyphro! how little does the common 
<A NAME="95"></A>herd know of the nature of right and truth. A man must be an extraordinary 
<A NAME="96"></A>man, and have made great strides in wisdom, before he could have seen his 
<A NAME="97"></A>way to bring such an action.
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Indeed, Socrates, he must.
<A NAME="99"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I suppose that the man whom your father murdered was 
<A NAME="100"></A>one of your relatives-clearly he was; for if he had been a stranger you 
<A NAME="101"></A>would never have thought of prosecuting him.
<A NAME="102"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> I am amused, Socrates, at your making a distinction 
<A NAME="103"></A>between one who is a relation and one who is not a relation; for surely 
<A NAME="104"></A>the pollution is the same in either case, if you knowingly associate with 
<A NAME="105"></A>the murderer when you ought to clear yourself and him by proceeding against 
<A NAME="106"></A>him. The real question is whether the murdered man has been justly slain. 
<A NAME="107"></A>If justly, then your duty is to let the matter alone; but if unjustly, 
<A NAME="108"></A>then even if the murderer lives under the same roof with you and eats at 
<A NAME="109"></A>the same table, proceed against him. Now the man who is dead was a poor 
<A NAME="110"></A>dependent of mine who worked for us as a field labourer on our farm in 
<A NAME="111"></A>Naxos, and one day in a fit of drunken passion he got into a quarrel with 
<A NAME="112"></A>one of our domestic servants and slew him. My father bound him hand and 
<A NAME="113"></A>foot and threw him into a ditch, and then sent to Athens to ask of a diviner 
<A NAME="114"></A>what he should do with him. Meanwhile he never attended to him and took 
<A NAME="115"></A>no care about him, for he regarded him as a murderer; and thought that 
<A NAME="116"></A>no great harm would be done even if he did die. Now this was just what 
<A NAME="117"></A>happened. For such was the effect of cold and hunger and chains upon him, 
<A NAME="118"></A>that before the messenger returned from the diviner, he was dead. And my 
<A NAME="119"></A>father and family are angry with me for taking the part of the murderer 
<A NAME="120"></A>and prosecuting my father. They say that he did not kill him, and that 
<A NAME="121"></A>if he did, dead man was but a murderer, and I ought not to take any notice, 
<A NAME="122"></A>for that a son is impious who prosecutes a father. Which shows, Socrates, 
<A NAME="123"></A>how little they know what the gods think about piety and 
<A NAME="124"></A>impiety.
<A NAME="125"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Good heavens, Euthyphro! and is your knowledge of religion 
<A NAME="126"></A>and of things pious and impious so very exact, that, supposing the circumstances 
<A NAME="127"></A>to be as you state them, you are not afraid lest you too may be doing an 
<A NAME="128"></A>impious thing in bringing an action against your father?
<A NAME="129"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> The best of Euthyphro, and that which distinguishes 
<A NAME="130"></A>him, Socrates, from other men, is his exact knowledge of all such matters. 
<A NAME="131"></A>What should I be good for without it?
<A NAME="132"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Rare friend! I think that I cannot do better than be 
<A NAME="133"></A>your disciple. Then before the trial with Meletus comes on I shall challenge 
<A NAME="134"></A>him, and say that I have always had a great interest in religious questions, 
<A NAME="135"></A>and now, as he charges me with rash imaginations and innovations in religion, 
<A NAME="136"></A>I have become your disciple. You, Meletus, as I shall say to him, acknowledge 
<A NAME="137"></A>Euthyphro to be a great theologian, and sound in his opinions; and if you 
<A NAME="138"></A>approve of him you ought to approve of me, and not have me into court; 
<A NAME="139"></A>but if you disapprove, you should begin by indicting him who is my teacher, 
<A NAME="140"></A>and who will be the ruin, not of the young, but of the old; that is to 
<A NAME="141"></A>say, of myself whom he instructs, and of his old father whom he admonishes 
<A NAME="142"></A>and chastises. And if Meletus refuses to listen to me, but will go on, 
<A NAME="143"></A>and will not shift the indictment from me to you, I cannot do better than 
<A NAME="144"></A>repeat this challenge in the court.
<A NAME="145"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Yes, indeed, Socrates; and if he attempts to indict 
<A NAME="146"></A>me I am mistaken if I do not find a flaw in him; the court shall have a 
<A NAME="147"></A>great deal more to say to him than to me.
<A NAME="148"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And I, my dear friend, knowing this, am desirous of 
<A NAME="149"></A>becoming your disciple. For I observe that no one appears to notice you- 
<A NAME="150"></A>not even this Meletus; but his sharp eyes have found me out at once, and 
<A NAME="151"></A>he has indicted me for impiety. And therefore, I adjure you to tell me 
<A NAME="152"></A>the nature of piety and impiety, which you said that you knew so well, 
<A NAME="153"></A>and of murder, and of other offences against the gods. What are they? Is 
<A NAME="154"></A>not piety in every action always the same? and impiety, again- is it not 
<A NAME="155"></A>always the opposite of piety, and also the same with itself, having, as 
<A NAME="156"></A>impiety, one notion which includes whatever is impious?
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> To be sure, Socrates.
<A NAME="158"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And what is piety, and what is impiety?
<A NAME="159"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Piety is doing as I am doing; that is to say, prosecuting 
<A NAME="160"></A>any one who is guilty of murder, sacrilege, or of any similar crime-whether 
<A NAME="161"></A>he be your father or mother, or whoever he may be-that makes no difference; 
<A NAME="162"></A>and not to prosecute them is impiety. And please to consider, Socrates, 
<A NAME="163"></A>what a notable proof I will give you of the truth of my words, a proof 
<A NAME="164"></A>which I have already given to others:-of the principle, I mean, that the 
<A NAME="165"></A>impious, whoever he may be, ought not to go unpunished. For do not men 
<A NAME="166"></A>regard Zeus as the best and most righteous of the gods?-and yet they admit 
<A NAME="167"></A>that he bound his father (Cronos) because he wickedly devoured his sons, 
<A NAME="168"></A>and that he too had punished his own father (Uranus) for a similar reason, 
<A NAME="169"></A>in a nameless manner. And yet when I proceed against my father, they are 
<A NAME="170"></A>angry with me. So inconsistent are they in their way of talking when the 
<A NAME="171"></A>gods are concerned, and when I am concerned.
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> May not this be the reason, Euthyphro, why I am charged 
<A NAME="173"></A>with impiety-that I cannot away with these stories about the gods? and 
<A NAME="174"></A>therefore I suppose that people think me wrong. But, as you who are well 
<A NAME="175"></A>informed about them approve of them, I cannot do better than assent to 
<A NAME="176"></A>your superior wisdom. What else can I say, confessing as I do, that I know 
<A NAME="177"></A>nothing about them? Tell me, for the love of Zeus, whether you really believe 
<A NAME="178"></A>that they are true.
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Yes, Socrates; and things more wonderful still, of 
<A NAME="180"></A>which the world is in ignorance.
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And do you really believe that the gods, fought with 
<A NAME="182"></A>one another, and had dire quarrels, battles, and the like, as the poets 
<A NAME="183"></A>say, and as you may see represented in the works of great artists? The 
<A NAME="184"></A>temples are full of them; and notably the robe of Athene, which is carried 
<A NAME="185"></A>up to the Acropolis at the great Panathenaea, is embroidered with them. 
<A NAME="186"></A>Are all these tales of the gods true, Euthyphro?
<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Yes, Socrates; and, as I was saying, I can tell you, 
<A NAME="188"></A>if you would like to hear them, many other things about the gods which 
<A NAME="189"></A>would quite amaze you.
<A NAME="190"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I dare say; and you shall tell me them at some other 
<A NAME="191"></A>time when I have leisure. But just at present I would rather hear from 
<A NAME="192"></A>you a more precise answer, which you have not as yet given, my friend, 
<A NAME="193"></A>to the question, What is "piety"? When asked, you only replied, Doing as 
<A NAME="194"></A>you do, charging your father with murder.
<A NAME="195"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> And what I said was true, Socrates.
<A NAME="196"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> No doubt, Euthyphro; but you would admit that there 
<A NAME="197"></A>are many other pious acts?
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> There are.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Remember that I did not ask you to give me two or three 
<A NAME="200"></A>examples of piety, but to explain the general idea which makes all pious 
<A NAME="201"></A>things to be pious. Do you not recollect that there was one idea which 
<A NAME="202"></A>made the impious impious, and the pious pious?
<A NAME="203"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> I remember.
<A NAME="204"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Tell me what is the nature of this idea, and then I 
<A NAME="205"></A>shall have a standard to which I may look, and by which I may measure actions, 
<A NAME="206"></A>whether yours or those of any one else, and then I shall be able to say 
<A NAME="207"></A>that such and such an action is pious, such another 
<A NAME="208"></A>impious.
<A NAME="209"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> I will tell you, if you like.
<A NAME="210"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I should very much like.
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Piety, then, is that which is dear to the gods, and 
<A NAME="212"></A>impiety is that which is not dear to them.
<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Very good, Euthyphro; you have now given me the sort 
<A NAME="214"></A>of answer which I wanted. But whether what you say is true or not I cannot 
<A NAME="215"></A>as yet tell, although I make no doubt that you will prove the truth of 
<A NAME="216"></A>your words.
<A NAME="217"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Of course.
<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Come, then, and let us examine what we are saying. 
<A NAME="219"></A>That thing or person which is dear to the gods is pious, and that thing 
<A NAME="220"></A>or person which is hateful to the gods is impious, these two being the 
<A NAME="221"></A>extreme opposites of one another. Was not that said?
<A NAME="222"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> It was.
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And well said?
<A NAME="224"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Yes, Socrates, I thought so; it was certainly 
<A NAME="225"></A>said.
<A NAME="226"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And further, Euthyphro, the gods were admitted to have 
<A NAME="227"></A>enmities and hatreds and differences?
<A NAME="228"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Yes, that was also said.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And what sort of difference creates enmity and anger? 
<A NAME="230"></A>Suppose for example that you and I, my good friend, differ about a number; 
<A NAME="231"></A>do differences of this sort make us enemies and set us at variance with 
<A NAME="232"></A>one another? Do we not go at once to arithmetic, and put an end to them 
<A NAME="233"></A>by a sum?
<A NAME="234"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> True.
<A NAME="235"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Or suppose that we differ about magnitudes, do we not 
<A NAME="236"></A>quickly end the differences by measuring?
<A NAME="237"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="238"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And we end a controversy about heavy and light by resorting 
<A NAME="239"></A>to a weighing machine?
<A NAME="240"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> To be sure.
<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But what differences are there which cannot be thus 
<A NAME="242"></A>decided, and which therefore make us angry and set us at enmity with one 
<A NAME="243"></A>another? I dare say the answer does not occur to you at the moment, and 
<A NAME="244"></A>therefore I will suggest that these enmities arise when the matters of 
<A NAME="245"></A>difference are the just and unjust, good and evil, honourable and dishonourable. 
<A NAME="246"></A>Are not these the points about which men differ, and about which when we 
<A NAME="247"></A>are unable satisfactorily to decide our differences, you and I and all 
<A NAME="248"></A>of us quarrel, when we do quarrel?
<A NAME="249"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Yes, Socrates, the nature of the differences about 
<A NAME="250"></A>which we quarrel is such as you describe.
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And the quarrels of the gods, noble Euthyphro, when 
<A NAME="252"></A>they occur, are of a like nature?
<A NAME="253"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Certainly they are.
<A NAME="254"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> They have differences of opinion, as you say, about 
<A NAME="255"></A>good and evil, just and unjust, honourable and dishonourable: there would 
<A NAME="256"></A>have been no quarrels among them, if there had been no such differences-would 
<A NAME="257"></A>there now?
<A NAME="258"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> You are quite right.
<A NAME="259"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Does not every man love that which he deems noble and 
<A NAME="260"></A>just and good, and hate the opposite of them?
<A NAME="261"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="262"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But, as you say, people regard the same things, some 
<A NAME="263"></A>as just and others as unjust,-about these they dispute; and so there arise 
<A NAME="264"></A>wars and fightings among them.
<A NAME="265"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then the same things are hated by the gods and loved 
<A NAME="267"></A>by the gods, and are both hateful and dear to them?
<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> True.
<A NAME="269"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And upon this view the same things, Euthyphro, will 
<A NAME="270"></A>be pious and also impious?
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> So I should suppose.
<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then, my friend, I remark with surprise that you have 
<A NAME="273"></A>not answered the question which I asked. For I certainly did not ask you 
<A NAME="274"></A>to tell me what action is both pious and impious: but now it would seem 
<A NAME="275"></A>that what is loved by the gods is also hated by them. And therefore, Euthyphro, 
<A NAME="276"></A>in thus chastising your father you may very likely be doing what is agreeable 
<A NAME="277"></A>to Zeus but disagreeable to Cronos or Uranus, and what is acceptable to 
<A NAME="278"></A>Hephaestus but unacceptable to Here, and there may be other gods who have 
<A NAME="279"></A>similar differences of opinion.
<A NAME="280"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> But I believe, Socrates, that all the gods would be 
<A NAME="281"></A>agreed as to the propriety of punishing a murderer: there would be no difference 
<A NAME="282"></A>of opinion about that.
<A NAME="283"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Well, but speaking of men, Euthyphro, did you ever 
<A NAME="284"></A>hear any one arguing that a murderer or any sort of evil-doer ought to 
<A NAME="285"></A>be let off?
<A NAME="286"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> I should rather say that these are the questions which 
<A NAME="287"></A>they are always arguing, especially in courts of law: they commit all sorts 
<A NAME="288"></A>of crimes, and there is nothing which they will not do or say in their 
<A NAME="289"></A>own defence.
<A NAME="290"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But do they admit their guilt, Euthyphro, and yet say 
<A NAME="291"></A>that they ought not to be punished?
<A NAME="292"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> No; they do not.
<A NAME="293"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then there are some things which they do not venture 
<A NAME="294"></A>to say and do: for they do not venture to argue that the guilty are to 
<A NAME="295"></A>be unpunished, but they deny their guilt, do they not?
<A NAME="296"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then they do not argue that the evil-doer should not 
<A NAME="298"></A>be punished, but they argue about the fact of who the evil-doer is, and 
<A NAME="299"></A>what he did and when?
<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> True.
<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And the gods are in the same case, if as you assert 
<A NAME="302"></A>they quarrel about just and unjust, and some of them say while others deny 
<A NAME="303"></A>that injustice is done among them. For surely neither God nor man will 
<A NAME="304"></A>ever venture to say that the doer of injustice is not to be 
<A NAME="305"></A>punished?
<A NAME="306"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> That is true, Socrates, in the 
<A NAME="307"></A>main.
<A NAME="308"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But they join issue about the particulars-gods and 
<A NAME="309"></A>men alike; and, if they dispute at all, they dispute about some act which 
<A NAME="310"></A>is called in question, and which by some is affirmed to be just, by others 
<A NAME="311"></A>to be unjust. Is not that true?
<A NAME="312"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Quite true.
<A NAME="313"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Well then, my dear friend Euthyphro, do tell me, for 
<A NAME="314"></A>my better instruction and information, what proof have you that in the 
<A NAME="315"></A>opinion of all the gods a servant who is guilty of murder, and is put in 
<A NAME="316"></A>chains by the master of the dead man, and dies because he is put in chains 
<A NAME="317"></A>before he who bound him can learn from the interpreters of the gods what 
<A NAME="318"></A>he ought to do with him, dies unjustly; and that on behalf of such an one 
<A NAME="319"></A>a son ought to proceed against his father and accuse him of murder. How 
<A NAME="320"></A>would you show that all the gods absolutely agree in approving of his act? 
<A NAME="321"></A>Prove to me that they do, and I will applaud your wisdom as long as I 
<A NAME="322"></A>live.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> It will be a difficult task; but I could make the 
<A NAME="324"></A>matter very dear indeed to you.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I understand; you mean to say that I am not so quick 
<A NAME="326"></A>of apprehension as the judges: for to them you will be sure to prove that 
<A NAME="327"></A>the act is unjust, and hateful to the gods.
<A NAME="328"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Yes indeed, Socrates; at least if they will listen 
<A NAME="329"></A>to me.
<A NAME="330"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But they will be sure to listen if they find that you 
<A NAME="331"></A>are a good speaker. There was a notion that came into my mind while you 
<A NAME="332"></A>were speaking; I said to myself: "Well, and what if Euthyphro does prove 
<A NAME="333"></A>to me that all the gods regarded the death of the serf as unjust, how do 
<A NAME="334"></A>I know anything more of the nature of piety and impiety? for granting that 
<A NAME="335"></A>this action may be hateful to the gods, still piety and impiety are not 
<A NAME="336"></A>adequately defined by these distinctions, for that which is hateful to 
<A NAME="337"></A>the gods has been shown to be also pleasing and dear to them." And therefore, 
<A NAME="338"></A>Euthyphro, I do not ask you to prove this; I will suppose, if you like, 
<A NAME="339"></A>that all the gods condemn and abominate such an action. But I will amend 
<A NAME="340"></A>the definition so far as to say that what all the gods hate is impious, 
<A NAME="341"></A>and what they love pious or holy; and what some of them love and others 
<A NAME="342"></A>hate is both or neither. Shall this be our definition of piety and 
<A NAME="343"></A>impiety?
<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Why not, Socrates?
<A NAME="345"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Why not! certainly, as far as I am concerned, Euthyphro, 
<A NAME="346"></A>there is no reason why not. But whether this admission will greatly assist 
<A NAME="347"></A>you in the task of instructing me as you promised, is a matter for you 
<A NAME="348"></A>to consider.
<A NAME="349"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Yes, I should say that what all the gods love is pious 
<A NAME="350"></A>and holy, and the opposite which they all hate, impious.
<A NAME="351"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Ought we to enquire into the truth of this, Euthyphro, 
<A NAME="352"></A>or simply to accept the mere statement on our own authority and that of 
<A NAME="353"></A>others? What do you say?
<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> We should enquire; and I believe that the statement 
<A NAME="355"></A>will stand the test of enquiry.
<A NAME="356"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> We shall know better, my good friend, in a little while. 
<A NAME="357"></A>The point which I should first wish to understand is whether the pious 
<A NAME="358"></A>or holy is beloved by the gods because it is holy, or holy because it is 
<A NAME="359"></A>beloved of the gods.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> I do not understand your meaning, 
<A NAME="361"></A>Socrates.
<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I will endeavour to explain: we, speak of carrying 
<A NAME="363"></A>and we speak of being carried, of leading and being led, seeing and being 
<A NAME="364"></A>seen. You know that in all such cases there is a difference, and you know 
<A NAME="365"></A>also in what the difference lies?
<A NAME="366"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> I think that I understand.
<A NAME="367"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And is not that which is beloved distinct from that 
<A NAME="368"></A>which loves?
<A NAME="369"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="370"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Well; and now tell me, is that which is carried in 
<A NAME="371"></A>this state of carrying because it is carried, or for some other 
<A NAME="372"></A>reason?
<A NAME="373"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> No; that is the reason.
<A NAME="374"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And the same is true of what is led and of what is 
<A NAME="375"></A>seen?
<A NAME="376"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> True.
<A NAME="377"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And a thing is not seen because it is visible, but 
<A NAME="378"></A>conversely, visible because it is seen; nor is a thing led because it is 
<A NAME="379"></A>in the state of being led, or carried because it is in the state of being 
<A NAME="380"></A>carried, but the converse of this. And now I think, Euthyphro, that my 
<A NAME="381"></A>meaning will be intelligible; and my meaning is, that any state of action 
<A NAME="382"></A>or passion implies previous action or passion. It does not become because 
<A NAME="383"></A>it is becoming, but it is in a state of becoming because it becomes; neither 
<A NAME="384"></A>does it suffer because it is in a state of suffering, but it is in a state 
<A NAME="385"></A>of suffering because it suffers. Do you not agree?
<A NAME="386"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="387"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Is not that which is loved in some state either of 
<A NAME="388"></A>becoming or suffering?
<A NAME="389"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="390"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And the same holds as in the previous instances; the 
<A NAME="391"></A>state of being loved follows the act of being loved, and not the act the 
<A NAME="392"></A>state.
<A NAME="393"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="394"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And what do you say of piety, Euthyphro: is not piety, 
<A NAME="395"></A>according to your definition, loved by all the gods?
<A NAME="396"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="397"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Because it is pious or holy, or for some other 
<A NAME="398"></A>reason?
<A NAME="399"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> No, that is the reason.
<A NAME="400"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> It is loved because it is holy, not holy because it 
<A NAME="401"></A>is loved?
<A NAME="402"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="403"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And that which is dear to the gods is loved by them, 
<A NAME="404"></A>and is in a state to be loved of them because it is loved of 
<A NAME="405"></A>them?
<A NAME="406"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="407"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then that which is dear to the gods, Euthyphro, is 
<A NAME="408"></A>not holy, nor is that which is holy loved of God, as you affirm; but they 
<A NAME="409"></A>are two different things.
<A NAME="410"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> How do you mean, Socrates?
<A NAME="411"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I mean to say that the holy has been acknowledge by 
<A NAME="412"></A>us to be loved of God because it is holy, not to be holy because it is 
<A NAME="413"></A>loved.
<A NAME="414"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But that which is dear to the gods is dear to them 
<A NAME="416"></A>because it is loved by them, not loved by them because it is dear to 
<A NAME="417"></A>them.
<A NAME="418"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> True.
<A NAME="419"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But, friend Euthyphro, if that which is holy is the 
<A NAME="420"></A>same with that which is dear to God, and is loved because it is holy, then 
<A NAME="421"></A>that which is dear to God would have been loved as being dear to God; but 
<A NAME="422"></A>if that which dear to God is dear to him because loved by him, then that 
<A NAME="423"></A>which is holy would have been holy because loved by him. But now you see 
<A NAME="424"></A>that the reverse is the case, and that they are quite different from one 
<A NAME="425"></A>another. For one (theophiles) is of a kind to be loved cause it is loved, 
<A NAME="426"></A>and the other (osion) is loved because it is of a kind to be loved. Thus 
<A NAME="427"></A>you appear to me, Euthyphro, when I ask you what is the essence of holiness, 
<A NAME="428"></A>to offer an attribute only, and not the essence-the attribute of being 
<A NAME="429"></A>loved by all the gods. But you still refuse to explain to me the nature 
<A NAME="430"></A>of holiness. And therefore, if you please, I will ask you not to hide your 
<A NAME="431"></A>treasure, but to tell me once more what holiness or piety really is, whether 
<A NAME="432"></A>dear to the gods or not (for that is a matter about which we will not quarrel) 
<A NAME="433"></A>and what is impiety?
<A NAME="434"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> I really do not know, Socrates, how to express what 
<A NAME="435"></A>I mean. For somehow or other our arguments, on whatever ground we rest 
<A NAME="436"></A>them, seem to turn round and walk away from us.
<A NAME="437"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Your words, Euthyphro, are like the handiwork of my 
<A NAME="438"></A>ancestor Daedalus; and if I were the sayer or propounder of them, you might 
<A NAME="439"></A>say that my arguments walk away and will not remain fixed where they are 
<A NAME="440"></A>placed because I am a descendant of his. But now, since these notions are 
<A NAME="441"></A>your own, you must find some other gibe, for they certainly, as you yourself 
<A NAME="442"></A>allow, show an inclination to be on the move.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Nay, Socrates, I shall still say that you are the 
<A NAME="444"></A>Daedalus who sets arguments in motion; not I, certainly, but you make them 
<A NAME="445"></A>move or go round, for they would never have stirred, as far as I am 
<A NAME="446"></A>concerned.
<A NAME="447"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then I must be a greater than Daedalus: for whereas 
<A NAME="448"></A>he only made his own inventions to move, I move those of other people as 
<A NAME="449"></A>well. And the beauty of it is, that I would rather not. For I would give 
<A NAME="450"></A>the wisdom of Daedalus, and the wealth of Tantalus, to be able to detain 
<A NAME="451"></A>them and keep them fixed. But enough of this. As I perceive that you are 
<A NAME="452"></A>lazy, I will myself endeavor to show you how you might instruct me in the 
<A NAME="453"></A>nature of piety; and I hope that you will not grudge your labour. Tell 
<A NAME="454"></A>me, then-Is not that which is pious necessarily just?
<A NAME="455"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="456"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And is, then, all which is just pious? or, is that 
<A NAME="457"></A>which is pious all just, but that which is just, only in part and not all, 
<A NAME="458"></A>pious?
<A NAME="459"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> I do not understand you, Socrates.
<A NAME="460"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And yet I know that you are as much wiser than I am, 
<A NAME="461"></A>as you are younger. But, as I was saying, revered friend, the abundance 
<A NAME="462"></A>of your wisdom makes you lazy. Please to exert yourself, for there is no 
<A NAME="463"></A>real difficulty in understanding me. What I mean I may explain by an illustration 
<A NAME="464"></A>of what I do not mean. The poet (Stasinus) sings-
<A NAME="465"></A><BR><BR>Of Zeus, the author and creator of all these 
<A NAME="466"></A>things,
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>You will not tell: for where there is fear there is 
<A NAME="468"></A>also
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>reverence. Now I disagree with this poet. Shall I tell you in what 
<A NAME="470"></A>respect?
<A NAME="471"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> By all means.
<A NAME="472"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I should not say that where there is fear there is 
<A NAME="473"></A>also reverence; for I am sure that many persons fear poverty and disease, 
<A NAME="474"></A>and the like evils, but I do not perceive that they reverence the objects 
<A NAME="475"></A>of their fear.
<A NAME="476"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="477"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But where reverence is, there is fear; for he who has 
<A NAME="478"></A>a feeling of reverence and shame about the commission of any action, fears 
<A NAME="479"></A>and is afraid of an ill reputation.
<A NAME="480"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> No doubt.
<A NAME="481"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then we are wrong in saying that where there is fear 
<A NAME="482"></A>there is also reverence; and we should say, where there is reverence there 
<A NAME="483"></A>is also fear. But there is not always reverence where there is fear; for 
<A NAME="484"></A>fear is a more extended notion, and reverence is a part of fear, just as 
<A NAME="485"></A>the odd is a part of number, and number is a more extended notion than 
<A NAME="486"></A>the odd. I suppose that you follow me now?
<A NAME="487"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Quite well.
<A NAME="488"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> That was the sort of question which I meant to raise 
<A NAME="489"></A>when I asked whether the just is always the pious, or the pious always 
<A NAME="490"></A>the just; and whether there may not be justice where there is not piety; 
<A NAME="491"></A>for justice is the more extended notion of which piety is only a part. 
<A NAME="492"></A>Do you dissent?
<A NAME="493"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> No, I think that you are quite 
<A NAME="494"></A>right.
<A NAME="495"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then, if piety is a part of justice, I suppose that 
<A NAME="496"></A>we should enquire what part? If you had pursued the enquiry in the previous 
<A NAME="497"></A>cases; for instance, if you had asked me what is an even number, and what 
<A NAME="498"></A>part of number the even is, I should have had no difficulty in replying, 
<A NAME="499"></A>a number which represents a figure having two equal sides. Do you not 
<A NAME="500"></A>agree?
<A NAME="501"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Yes, I quite agree.
<A NAME="502"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> In like manner, I want you to tell me what part of 
<A NAME="503"></A>justice is piety or holiness, that I may be able to tell Meletus not to 
<A NAME="504"></A>do me injustice, or indict me for impiety, as I am now adequately instructed 
<A NAME="505"></A>by you in the nature of piety or holiness, and their 
<A NAME="506"></A>opposites.
<A NAME="507"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Piety or holiness, Socrates, appears to me to be that 
<A NAME="508"></A>part of justice which attends to the gods, as there is the other part of 
<A NAME="509"></A>justice which attends to men.
<A NAME="510"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> That is good, Euthyphro; yet still there is a little 
<A NAME="511"></A>point about which I should like to have further information, What is the 
<A NAME="512"></A>meaning of "attention"? For attention can hardly be used in the same sense 
<A NAME="513"></A>when applied to the gods as when applied to other things. For instance, 
<A NAME="514"></A>horses are said to require attention, and not every person is able to attend 
<A NAME="515"></A>to them, but only a person skilled in horsemanship. Is it not 
<A NAME="516"></A>so?
<A NAME="517"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="518"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I should suppose that the art of horsemanship is the 
<A NAME="519"></A>art of attending to horses?
<A NAME="520"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="521"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Nor is every one qualified to attend to dogs, but only 
<A NAME="522"></A>the huntsman?
<A NAME="523"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> True.
<A NAME="524"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And I should also conceive that the art of the huntsman 
<A NAME="525"></A>is the art of attending to dogs?
<A NAME="526"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="527"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> As the art of the ox herd is the art of attending to 
<A NAME="528"></A>oxen?
<A NAME="529"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="530"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> In like manner holiness or piety is the art of attending 
<A NAME="531"></A>to the gods?-that would be your meaning, Euthyphro?
<A NAME="532"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="533"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And is not attention always designed for the good or 
<A NAME="534"></A>benefit of that to which the attention is given? As in the case of horses, 
<A NAME="535"></A>you may observe that when attended to by the horseman's art they are benefited 
<A NAME="536"></A>and improved, are they not?
<A NAME="537"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> True.
<A NAME="538"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> As the dogs are benefited by the huntsman's art, and 
<A NAME="539"></A>the oxen by the art of the ox herd, and all other things are tended or 
<A NAME="540"></A>attended for their good and not for their hurt?
<A NAME="541"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Certainly, not for their hurt.
<A NAME="542"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But for their good?
<A NAME="543"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Of course.
<A NAME="544"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And does piety or holiness, which has been defined 
<A NAME="545"></A>to be the art of attending to the gods, benefit or improve them? Would 
<A NAME="546"></A>you say that when you do a holy act you make any of the gods 
<A NAME="547"></A>better?
<A NAME="548"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> No, no; that was certainly not what I 
<A NAME="549"></A>meant.
<A NAME="550"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And I, Euthyphro, never supposed that you did. I asked 
<A NAME="551"></A>you the question about the nature of the attention, because I thought that 
<A NAME="552"></A>you did not.
<A NAME="553"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> You do me justice, Socrates; that is not the sort 
<A NAME="554"></A>of attention which I mean.
<A NAME="555"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Good: but I must still ask what is this attention to 
<A NAME="556"></A>the gods which is called piety?
<A NAME="557"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> It is such, Socrates, as servants show to their 
<A NAME="558"></A>masters.
<A NAME="559"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I understand-a sort of ministration to the 
<A NAME="560"></A>gods.
<A NAME="561"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Exactly.
<A NAME="562"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Medicine is also a sort of ministration or service, 
<A NAME="563"></A>having in view the attainment of some object-would you not say of 
<A NAME="564"></A>health?
<A NAME="565"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> I should.
<A NAME="566"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Again, there is an art which ministers to the ship-builder 
<A NAME="567"></A>with a view to the attainment of some result?
<A NAME="568"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Yes, Socrates, with a view to the building of a 
<A NAME="569"></A>ship.
<A NAME="570"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> As there is an art which ministers to the housebuilder 
<A NAME="571"></A>with a view to the building of a house?
<A NAME="572"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="573"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And now tell me, my good friend, about the art which 
<A NAME="574"></A>ministers to the gods: what work does that help to accomplish? For you 
<A NAME="575"></A>must surely know if, as you say, you are of all men living the one who 
<A NAME="576"></A>is best instructed in religion.
<A NAME="577"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> And I speak the truth, Socrates.
<A NAME="578"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Tell me then, oh tell me-what is that fair work which 
<A NAME="579"></A>the gods do by the help of our ministrations?
<A NAME="580"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Many and fair, Socrates, are the works which they 
<A NAME="581"></A>do. Soc. Why, my friend, and so are those of a general. But the chief of 
<A NAME="582"></A>them is easily told. Would you not say that victory in war is the chief 
<A NAME="583"></A>of them?
<A NAME="584"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="585"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Many and fair, too, are the works of the husbandman, 
<A NAME="586"></A>if I am not mistaken; but his chief work is the production of food from 
<A NAME="587"></A>the earth?
<A NAME="588"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Exactly.
<A NAME="589"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And of the many and fair things done by the gods, which 
<A NAME="590"></A>is the chief or principal one?
<A NAME="591"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> I have told you already, Socrates, that to learn all 
<A NAME="592"></A>these things accurately will be very tiresome. Let me simply say that piety 
<A NAME="593"></A>or holiness is learning, how to please the gods in word and deed, by prayers 
<A NAME="594"></A>and sacrifices. Such piety, is the salvation of families and states, just 
<A NAME="595"></A>as the impious, which is unpleasing to the gods, is their ruin and 
<A NAME="596"></A>destruction.
<A NAME="597"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I think that you could have answered in much fewer 
<A NAME="598"></A>words the chief question which I asked, Euthyphro, if you had chosen. But 
<A NAME="599"></A>I see plainly that you are not disposed to instruct me-dearly not: else 
<A NAME="600"></A>why, when we reached the point, did you turn, aside? Had you only answered 
<A NAME="601"></A>me I should have truly learned of you by this time the-nature of piety. 
<A NAME="602"></A>Now, as the asker of a question is necessarily dependent on the answerer, 
<A NAME="603"></A>whither he leads-I must follow; and can only ask again, what is the pious, 
<A NAME="604"></A>and what is piety? Do you mean that they are a, sort of science of praying 
<A NAME="605"></A>and sacrificing?
<A NAME="606"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Yes, I do.
<A NAME="607"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And sacrificing is giving to the gods, and prayer is 
<A NAME="608"></A>asking of the gods?
<A NAME="609"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Yes, Socrates.
<A NAME="610"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Upon this view, then piety is a science of asking and 
<A NAME="611"></A>giving?
<A NAME="612"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> You understand me capitally, Socrates.
<A NAME="613"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yes, my friend; the. reason is that I am a votary of 
<A NAME="614"></A>your science, and give my mind to it, and therefore nothing which you say 
<A NAME="615"></A>will be thrown away upon me. Please then to tell me, what is the nature 
<A NAME="616"></A>of this service to the gods? Do you mean that we prefer requests and give 
<A NAME="617"></A>gifts to them?
<A NAME="618"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Yes, I do.
<A NAME="619"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Is not the right way of asking to ask of them what 
<A NAME="620"></A>we want?
<A NAME="621"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="622"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And the right way of giving is to give to them in return 
<A NAME="623"></A>what they want of us. There would be no, in an art which gives to any one 
<A NAME="624"></A>that which he does not want.
<A NAME="625"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Very true, Socrates.
<A NAME="626"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then piety, Euthyphro, is an art which gods and men 
<A NAME="627"></A>have of doing business with one another?
<A NAME="628"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> That is an expression which you may use, if you 
<A NAME="629"></A>like.
<A NAME="630"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But I have no particular liking for anything but the 
<A NAME="631"></A>truth. I wish, however, that you would tell me what benefit accrues to 
<A NAME="632"></A>the gods from our gifts. There is no doubt about what they give to us; 
<A NAME="633"></A>for there is no good thing which they do not give; but how we can give 
<A NAME="634"></A>any good thing to them in return is far from being equally clear. If they 
<A NAME="635"></A>give everything and we give nothing, that must be an affair of business 
<A NAME="636"></A>in which we have very greatly the advantage of them.
<A NAME="637"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> And do you imagine, Socrates, that any benefit accrues 
<A NAME="638"></A>to the gods from our gifts?
<A NAME="639"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But if not, Euthyphro, what is the meaning of gifts 
<A NAME="640"></A>which are conferred by us upon the gods?
<A NAME="641"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> What else, but tributes of honour; and, as I was just 
<A NAME="642"></A>now saying, what pleases them?
<A NAME="643"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Piety, then, is pleasing to the gods, but not beneficial 
<A NAME="644"></A>or dear to them?
<A NAME="645"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> I should say that nothing could be 
<A NAME="646"></A>dearer.
<A NAME="647"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then once more the assertion is repeated that piety 
<A NAME="648"></A>is dear to the gods?
<A NAME="649"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="650"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And when you say this, can you wonder at your words 
<A NAME="651"></A>not standing firm, but walking away? Will you accuse me of being the Daedalus 
<A NAME="652"></A>who makes them walk away, not perceiving that there is another and far 
<A NAME="653"></A>greater artist than Daedalus who makes them go round in a circle, and he 
<A NAME="654"></A>is yourself; for the argument, as you will perceive, comes round to the 
<A NAME="655"></A>same point. Were we not saying that the holy or pious was not the same 
<A NAME="656"></A>with that which is loved of the gods? Have you forgotten?
<A NAME="657"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> I quite remember.
<A NAME="658"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And are you not saying that what is loved of the gods 
<A NAME="659"></A>is holy; and is not this the same as what is dear to them-do you 
<A NAME="660"></A>see?
<A NAME="661"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> True.
<A NAME="662"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then either we were wrong in former assertion; or, 
<A NAME="663"></A>if we were right then, we are wrong now.
<A NAME="664"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> One of the two must be true.
<A NAME="665"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then we must begin again and ask, What is piety? That 
<A NAME="666"></A>is an enquiry which I shall never be weary of pursuing as far as in me 
<A NAME="667"></A>lies; and I entreat you not to scorn me, but to apply your mind to the 
<A NAME="668"></A>utmost, and tell me the truth. For, if any man knows, you are he; and therefore 
<A NAME="669"></A>I must detain you, like Proteus, until you tell. If you had not certainly 
<A NAME="670"></A>known the nature of piety and impiety, I am confident that you would never, 
<A NAME="671"></A>on behalf of a serf, have charged your aged father with murder. You would 
<A NAME="672"></A>not have run such a risk of doing wrong in the sight of the gods, and you 
<A NAME="673"></A>would have had too much respect for the opinions of men. I am sure, therefore, 
<A NAME="674"></A>that you know the nature of piety and impiety. Speak out then, my dear 
<A NAME="675"></A>Euthyphro, and do not hide your knowledge.
<A NAME="676"></A><BR><BR><B>Euth.</B> Another time, Socrates; for I am in a hurry, and must 
<A NAME="677"></A>go now.
<A NAME="678"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Alas! my companion, and will you leave me in despair? 
<A NAME="679"></A>I was hoping that you would instruct me in the nature of piety and impiety; 
<A NAME="680"></A>and then I might have cleared myself of Meletus and his indictment. I would 
<A NAME="681"></A>have told him that I had been enlightened by Euthyphro, and had given up 
<A NAME="682"></A>rash innovations and speculations, in which I indulged only through ignorance, 
<A NAME="683"></A>and that now I am about to lead a better life.
