<A NAME="14"></A><BR><BR><B>Socrates.</B> My dear Phaedrus, whence come you, and whither 
<A NAME="15"></A>are you going?
<A NAME="16"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedrus.</B> I come from Lysias the son of Cephalus, and I 
<A NAME="17"></A>am going to take a walk outside the wall, for I have been sitting with 
<A NAME="18"></A>him the whole morning; and our common friend Acumenus tells me that it 
<A NAME="19"></A>is much more refreshing to walk in the open air than to be shut up in a 
<A NAME="20"></A>cloister.
<A NAME="21"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> There he is right. Lysias then, I suppose, was in the 
<A NAME="22"></A>town?
<A NAME="23"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> Yes, he was staying with Epicrates, here at the 
<A NAME="24"></A>house of Morychus; that house which is near the temple of Olympian 
<A NAME="25"></A>Zeus.
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And how did he entertain you? Can I be wrong in supposing 
<A NAME="27"></A>that Lysias gave you a feast of discourse?
<A NAME="28"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> You shall hear, if you can spare time to accompany 
<A NAME="29"></A>me.
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And should I not deem the conversation of you and Lysias 
<A NAME="31"></A>"a thing of higher import," as I may say in the words of Pindar, "than 
<A NAME="32"></A>any business"?
<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> Will you go on?
<A NAME="34"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And will you go on with the narration?
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> My tale, Socrates, is one of your sort, for love 
<A NAME="36"></A>was the theme which occupied us -love after a fashion: Lysias has been 
<A NAME="37"></A>writing about a fair youth who was being tempted, but not by a lover; and 
<A NAME="38"></A>this was the point: he ingeniously proved that the non-lover should be 
<A NAME="39"></A>accepted rather than the lover.
<A NAME="40"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> O that is noble of him! I wish that he would say the 
<A NAME="41"></A>poor man rather than the rich, and the old man rather than the young one; 
<A NAME="42"></A>then he would meet the case of me and of many a man; his words would be 
<A NAME="43"></A>quite refreshing, and he would be a public benefactor. For my part, I do 
<A NAME="44"></A>so long to hear his speech, that if you walk all the way to Megara, and 
<A NAME="45"></A>when you have reached the wall come back, as Herodicus recommends, without 
<A NAME="46"></A>going in, I will keep you company.
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> What do you mean, my good Socrates? How can you 
<A NAME="48"></A>imagine that my unpractised memory can do justice to an elaborate work, 
<A NAME="49"></A>which the greatest rhetorician of the age spent a long time in composing. 
<A NAME="50"></A>Indeed, I cannot; I would give a great deal if I could.
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I believe that I know Phaedrus about as well as I know 
<A NAME="52"></A>myself, and I am very sure that the speech of Lysias was repeated to him, 
<A NAME="53"></A>not once only, but again and again;-he insisted on hearing it many times 
<A NAME="54"></A>over and Lysias was very willing to gratify him; at last, when nothing 
<A NAME="55"></A>else would do, he got hold of the book, and looked at what he most wanted 
<A NAME="56"></A>to see,-this occupied him during the whole morning; -and then when he was 
<A NAME="57"></A>tired with sitting, he went out to take a walk, not until, by the dog, 
<A NAME="58"></A>as I believe, he had simply learned by heart the entire discourse, unless 
<A NAME="59"></A>it was unusually long, and he went to a place outside the wall that he 
<A NAME="60"></A>might practise his lesson. There he saw a certain lover of discourse who 
<A NAME="61"></A>had a similar weakness;-he saw and rejoiced; now thought he, "I shall have 
<A NAME="62"></A>a partner in my revels." And he invited him to come and walk with him. 
<A NAME="63"></A>But when the lover of discourse begged that he would repeat the tale, he 
<A NAME="64"></A>gave himself airs and said, "No I cannot," as if he were indisposed; although, 
<A NAME="65"></A>if the hearer had refused, he would sooner or later have been compelled 
<A NAME="66"></A>by him to listen whether he would or no. Therefore, Phaedrus, bid him do 
<A NAME="67"></A>at once what he will soon do whether bidden or not.
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> I see that you will not let me off until I speak 
<A NAME="69"></A>in some fashion or other; verily therefore my best plan is to speak as 
<A NAME="70"></A>I best can.
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> A very true remark, that of yours.
<A NAME="72"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> I will do as I say; but believe me, Socrates, I 
<A NAME="73"></A>did not learn the very words-O no; nevertheless I have a general notion 
<A NAME="74"></A>of what he said, and will give you a summary of the points in which the 
<A NAME="75"></A>lover differed from the non-lover. Let me begin at the 
<A NAME="76"></A>beginning.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yes, my sweet one; but you must first of all show what 
<A NAME="78"></A>you have in your left hand under your cloak, for that roll, as I suspect, 
<A NAME="79"></A>is the actual discourse. Now, much as I love you, I would not have you 
<A NAME="80"></A>suppose that I am going to have your memory exercised at my expense, if 
<A NAME="81"></A>you have Lysias himself here.
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> Enough; I see that I have no hope of practising 
<A NAME="83"></A>my art upon you. But if I am to read, where would you please to 
<A NAME="84"></A>sit?
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Let us turn aside and go by the Ilissus; we will sit 
<A NAME="86"></A>down at some quiet spot.
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> I am fortunate in not having my sandals, and as 
<A NAME="88"></A>you never have any, I think that we may go along the brook and cool our 
<A NAME="89"></A>feet in the water; this will be the easiest way, and at midday and in the 
<A NAME="90"></A>summer is far from being unpleasant.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Lead on, and look out for a place in which we can sit 
<A NAME="92"></A>down.
<A NAME="93"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> Do you see the tallest plane-tree in the 
<A NAME="94"></A>distance?
<A NAME="95"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="96"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> There are shade and gentle breezes, and grass on 
<A NAME="97"></A>which we may either sit or lie down.
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Move forward.
<A NAME="99"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> I should like to know, Socrates, whether the place 
<A NAME="100"></A>is not somewhere here at which Boreas is said to have carried off Orithyia 
<A NAME="101"></A>from the banks of the Ilissus?
<A NAME="102"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Such is the tradition.
<A NAME="103"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> And is this the exact spot? The little stream is 
<A NAME="104"></A>delightfully clear and bright; I can fancy that there might be maidens 
<A NAME="105"></A>playing near.
<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I believe that the spot is not exactly here, but about 
<A NAME="107"></A>a quarter of a mile lower down, where you cross to the temple of Artemis, 
<A NAME="108"></A>and there is, I think, some sort of an altar of Boreas at the 
<A NAME="109"></A>place.
<A NAME="110"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> I have never noticed it; but I beseech you to tell 
<A NAME="111"></A>me, Socrates, do you believe this tale?
<A NAME="112"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> The wise are doubtful, and I should not be singular 
<A NAME="113"></A>if, like them, I too doubted. I might have a rational explanation that 
<A NAME="114"></A>Orithyia was playing with Pharmacia, when a northern gust carried her over 
<A NAME="115"></A>the neighbouring rocks; and this being the manner of her death, she was 
<A NAME="116"></A>said to have been carried away by Boreas. There is a discrepancy, however, 
<A NAME="117"></A>about the locality; according to another version of the story she was taken 
<A NAME="118"></A>from Areopagus, and not from this place. Now I quite acknowledge that these 
<A NAME="119"></A>allegories are very nice, but he is not to be envied who has to invent 
<A NAME="120"></A>them; much labour and ingenuity will be required of him; and when he has 
<A NAME="121"></A>once begun, he must go on and rehabilitate Hippocentaurs and chimeras dire. 
<A NAME="122"></A>Gorgons and winged steeds flow in apace, and numberless other inconceivable 
<A NAME="123"></A>and portentous natures. And if he is sceptical about them, and would fain 
<A NAME="124"></A>reduce them one after another to the rules of probability, this sort of 
<A NAME="125"></A>crude philosophy will take up a great deal of time. Now I have no leisure 
<A NAME="126"></A>for such enquiries; shall I tell you why? I must first know myself, as 
<A NAME="127"></A>the Delphian inscription says; to be curious about that which is not my 
<A NAME="128"></A>concern, while I am still in ignorance of my own self, would be ridiculous. 
<A NAME="129"></A>And therefore I bid farewell to all this; the common opinion is enough 
<A NAME="130"></A>for me. For, as I was saying, I want to know not about this, but about 
<A NAME="131"></A>myself: am I a monster more complicated and swollen with passion than the 
<A NAME="132"></A>serpent Typho, or a creature of a gentler and simpler sort, to whom Nature 
<A NAME="133"></A>has given a diviner and lowlier destiny? But let me ask you, friend: have 
<A NAME="134"></A>we not reached the plane-tree to which you were conducting 
<A NAME="135"></A>us?
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> Yes, this is the tree.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> By Here, a fair resting-place, full of summer sounds 
<A NAME="138"></A>and scents. Here is this lofty and spreading plane-tree, and the agnus 
<A NAME="139"></A>cast us high and clustering, in the fullest blossom and the greatest fragrance; 
<A NAME="140"></A>and the stream which flows beneath the plane-tree is deliciously cold to 
<A NAME="141"></A>the feet. Judging from the ornaments and images, this must be a spot sacred 
<A NAME="142"></A>to Achelous and the Nymphs. How delightful is the breeze:-so very sweet; 
<A NAME="143"></A>and there is a sound in the air shrill and summerlike which makes answer 
<A NAME="144"></A>to the chorus of the cicadae. But the greatest charm of all is the grass, 
<A NAME="145"></A>like a pillow gently sloping to the head. My dear Phaedrus, you have been 
<A NAME="146"></A>an admirable guide.
<A NAME="147"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> What an incomprehensible being you are, Socrates: 
<A NAME="148"></A>when you are in the country, as you say, you really are like some stranger 
<A NAME="149"></A>who is led about by a guide. Do you ever cross the border? I rather think 
<A NAME="150"></A>that you never venture even outside the gates.
<A NAME="151"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Very true, my good friend; and I hope that you will 
<A NAME="152"></A>excuse me when you hear the reason, which is, that I am a lover of knowledge, 
<A NAME="153"></A>and the men who dwell in the city are my teachers, and not the trees or 
<A NAME="154"></A>the country. Though I do indeed believe that you have found a spell with 
<A NAME="155"></A>which to draw me out of the city into the country, like a hungry cow before 
<A NAME="156"></A>whom a bough or a bunch of fruit is waved. For only hold up before me in 
<A NAME="157"></A>like manner a book, and you may lead me all round Attica, and over the 
<A NAME="158"></A>wide world. And now having arrived, I intend to lie down, and do you choose 
<A NAME="159"></A>any posture in which you can read best. Begin.
<A NAME="160"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> Listen. You know how matters stand with me; and 
<A NAME="161"></A>how, as I conceive, this affair may be arranged for the advantage of both 
<A NAME="162"></A>of us. And I maintain that I ought not to fail in my suit, because I am 
<A NAME="163"></A>not your lover: for lovers repent of the kindnesses which they have shown 
<A NAME="164"></A>when their passion ceases, but to the non-lovers who are free and not under 
<A NAME="165"></A>any compulsion, no time of repentance ever comes; for they confer their 
<A NAME="166"></A>benefits according to the measure of their ability, in the way which is 
<A NAME="167"></A>most conducive to their own interest. Then again, lovers consider how by 
<A NAME="168"></A>reason of their love they have neglected their own concerns and rendered 
<A NAME="169"></A>service to others: and when to these benefits conferred they add on the 
<A NAME="170"></A>troubles which they have endured, they think that they have long ago made 
<A NAME="171"></A>to the beloved a very ample return. But the non-lover has no such tormenting 
<A NAME="172"></A>recollections; he has never neglected his affairs or quarrelled with his 
<A NAME="173"></A>relations; he has no troubles to add up or excuse to invent; and being 
<A NAME="174"></A>well rid of all these evils, why should he not freely do what will gratify 
<A NAME="175"></A>the beloved?
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR>If you say that the lover is more to be esteemed, because his love 
<A NAME="177"></A>is thought to be greater; for he is willing to say and do what is hateful 
<A NAME="178"></A>to other men, in order to please his beloved;-that, if true, is only a 
<A NAME="179"></A>proof that he will prefer any future love to his present, and will injure 
<A NAME="180"></A>his old love at the pleasure of the new. And how, in a matter of such infinite 
<A NAME="181"></A>importance, can a man be right in trusting himself to one who is afflicted 
<A NAME="182"></A>with a malady which no experienced person would attempt to cure, for the 
<A NAME="183"></A>patient himself admits that he is not in his right mind, and acknowledges 
<A NAME="184"></A>that he is wrong in his mind, but says that he is unable to control himself? 
<A NAME="185"></A>And if he came to his right mind, would he ever imagine that the desires 
<A NAME="186"></A>were good which he conceived when in his wrong mind? Once more, there are 
<A NAME="187"></A>many more non-lovers than lovers; and if you choose the best of the lovers, 
<A NAME="188"></A>you will not have many to choose from; but if from the non-lovers, the 
<A NAME="189"></A>choice will be larger, and you will be far more likely to find among them 
<A NAME="190"></A>a person who is worthy of your friendship. If public opinion be your dread, 
<A NAME="191"></A>and you would avoid reproach, in all probability the lover, who is always 
<A NAME="192"></A>thinking that other men are as emulous of him as he is of them, will boast 
<A NAME="193"></A>to some one of his successes, and make a show of them openly in the pride 
<A NAME="194"></A>of his heart;-he wants others to know that his labour has not been lost; 
<A NAME="195"></A>but the non-lover is more his own master, and is desirous of solid good, 
<A NAME="196"></A>and not of the opinion of mankind. Again, the lover may be generally noted 
<A NAME="197"></A>or seen following the beloved (this is his regular occupation), and whenever 
<A NAME="198"></A>they are observed to exchange two words they are supposed to meet about 
<A NAME="199"></A>some affair of love either past or in contemplation; but when non-lovers 
<A NAME="200"></A>meet, no one asks the reason why, because people know that talking to another 
<A NAME="201"></A>is natural, whether friendship or mere pleasure be the 
<A NAME="202"></A>motive.
<A NAME="203"></A><BR><BR>Once more, if you fear the fickleness of friendship, consider that 
<A NAME="204"></A>in any other case a quarrel might be a mutual calamity; but now, when you 
<A NAME="205"></A>have given up what is most precious to you, you will be the greater loser, 
<A NAME="206"></A>and therefore, you will have more reason in being afraid of the lover, 
<A NAME="207"></A>for his vexations are many, and he is always fancying that every one is 
<A NAME="208"></A>leagued against him. Wherefore also he debars his beloved from society; 
<A NAME="209"></A>he will not have you intimate with the wealthy, lest they should exceed 
<A NAME="210"></A>him in wealth, or with men of education, lest they should be his superiors 
<A NAME="211"></A>in understanding; and he is equally afraid of anybody's influence who has 
<A NAME="212"></A>any other advantage over himself. If he can persuade you to break with 
<A NAME="213"></A>them, you are left without friend in the world; or if, out of a regard 
<A NAME="214"></A>to your own interest, you have more sense than to comply with his desire, 
<A NAME="215"></A>you will have to quarrel with him. But those who are non-lovers, and whose 
<A NAME="216"></A>success in love is the reward of their merit, will not be jealous of the 
<A NAME="217"></A>companions of their beloved, and will rather hate those who refuse to be 
<A NAME="218"></A>his associates, thinking that their favourite is slighted by the latter 
<A NAME="219"></A>and benefited by the former; for more love than hatred may be expected 
<A NAME="220"></A>to come to him out of his friendship with others. Many lovers too have 
<A NAME="221"></A>loved the person of a youth before they knew his character or his belongings; 
<A NAME="222"></A>so that when their passion has passed away, there is no knowing whether 
<A NAME="223"></A>they will continue to be his friends; whereas, in the case of non-lovers 
<A NAME="224"></A>who were always friends, the friendship is not lessened by the favours 
<A NAME="225"></A>granted; but the recollection of these remains with them, and is an earnest 
<A NAME="226"></A>of good things to come.
<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR>Further, I say that you are likely to be improved by me, whereas 
<A NAME="228"></A>the lover will spoil you. For they praise your words and actions in a wrong 
<A NAME="229"></A>way; partly, because they are afraid of offending you, and also, their 
<A NAME="230"></A>judgment is weakened by passion. Such are the feats which love exhibits; 
<A NAME="231"></A>he makes things painful to the disappointed which give no pain to others; 
<A NAME="232"></A>he compels the successful lover to praise what ought not to give him pleasure, 
<A NAME="233"></A>and therefore the beloved is to be pitied rather than envied. But if you 
<A NAME="234"></A>listen to me, in the first place, I, in my intercourse with you, shall 
<A NAME="235"></A>not merely regard present enjoyment, but also future advantage, being not 
<A NAME="236"></A>mastered by love, but my own master; nor for small causes taking violent 
<A NAME="237"></A>dislikes, but even when the cause is great, slowly laying up little wrath-unintentional 
<A NAME="238"></A>offences I shall forgive, and intentional ones I shall try to prevent; 
<A NAME="239"></A>and these are the marks of a friendship which will last.
<A NAME="240"></A><BR><BR>Do you think that a lover only can be a firm friend? reflect:-if 
<A NAME="241"></A>this were true, we should set small value on sons, or fathers, or mothers; 
<A NAME="242"></A>nor should we ever have loyal friends, for our love of them arises not 
<A NAME="243"></A>from passion, but from other associations. Further, if we ought to shower 
<A NAME="244"></A>favours on those who are the most eager suitors,-on that principle, we 
<A NAME="245"></A>ought always to do good, not to the most virtuous, but to the most needy; 
<A NAME="246"></A>for they are the persons who will be most relieved, and will therefore 
<A NAME="247"></A>be the most grateful; and when you make a feast you should invite not your 
<A NAME="248"></A>friend, but the beggar and the empty soul; for they will love you, and 
<A NAME="249"></A>attend you, and come about your doors, and will be the best pleased, and 
<A NAME="250"></A>the most grateful, and will invoke many a blessing on your head. Yet surely 
<A NAME="251"></A>you ought not to be granting favours to those who besiege you with prayer, 
<A NAME="252"></A>but to those who are best able to reward you; nor to the lover only, but 
<A NAME="253"></A>to those who are worthy of love; nor to those who will enjoy the bloom 
<A NAME="254"></A>of your youth, but to those who will share their possessions with you in 
<A NAME="255"></A>age; nor to those who, having succeeded, will glory in their success to 
<A NAME="256"></A>others, but to those who will be modest and tell no tales; nor to those 
<A NAME="257"></A>who care about you for a moment only, but to those who will continue your 
<A NAME="258"></A>friends through life; nor to those who, when their passion is over, will 
<A NAME="259"></A>pick a quarrel with you, but rather to those who, when the charm of youth 
<A NAME="260"></A>has left you, will show their own virtue. Remember what I have said; and 
<A NAME="261"></A>consider yet this further point: friends admonish the lover under the idea 
<A NAME="262"></A>that his way of life is bad, but no one of his kindred ever yet censured 
<A NAME="263"></A>the non-lover, or thought that he was ill-advised about his own 
<A NAME="264"></A>interests.
<A NAME="265"></A><BR><BR>"Perhaps you will ask me whether I propose that you should indulge 
<A NAME="266"></A>every non-lover. To which I reply that not even the lover would advise 
<A NAME="267"></A>you to indulge all lovers, for the indiscriminate favour is less esteemed 
<A NAME="268"></A>by the rational recipient, and less easily hidden by him who would escape 
<A NAME="269"></A>the censure of the world. Now love ought to be for the advantage of both 
<A NAME="270"></A>parties, and for the injury of neither.
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>"I believe that I have said enough; but if there is anything more 
<A NAME="272"></A>which you desire or which in your opinion needs to be supplied, ask and 
<A NAME="273"></A>I will answer."
<A NAME="274"></A><BR><BR>Now, Socrates, what do you think? Is not the discourse excellent, 
<A NAME="275"></A>more especially in the matter of the language?
<A NAME="276"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yes, quite admirable; the effect on me was ravishing. 
<A NAME="277"></A>And this I owe to you, Phaedrus, for I observed you while reading to be 
<A NAME="278"></A>in an ecstasy, and thinking that you are more experienced in these matters 
<A NAME="279"></A>than I am, I followed your example, and, like you, my divine darling, I 
<A NAME="280"></A>became inspired with a phrenzy.
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> Indeed, you are pleased to be 
<A NAME="282"></A>merry.
<A NAME="283"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Do you mean that I am not in earnest?
<A NAME="284"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> Now don't talk in that way, Socrates, but let me 
<A NAME="285"></A>have your real opinion; I adjure you, by Zeus, the god of friendship, to 
<A NAME="286"></A>tell me whether you think that any Hellene could have said more or spoken 
<A NAME="287"></A>better on the same subject.
<A NAME="288"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Well, but are you and I expected to praise the sentiments 
<A NAME="289"></A>of the author, or only the clearness, and roundness, and finish, and tournure 
<A NAME="290"></A>of the language? As to the first I willingly submit to your better judgment, 
<A NAME="291"></A>for I am not worthy to form an opinion, having only attended to the rhetorical 
<A NAME="292"></A>manner; and I was doubting whether this could have been defended even by 
<A NAME="293"></A>Lysias himself; I thought, though I speak under correction, that he repeated 
<A NAME="294"></A>himself two or three times, either from want of words or from want of pains; 
<A NAME="295"></A>and also, he appeared to me ostentatiously to exult in showing how well 
<A NAME="296"></A>he could say the same thing in two or three ways.
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> Nonsense, Socrates; what you call repetition was 
<A NAME="298"></A>the especial merit of the speech; for he omitted no topic of which the 
<A NAME="299"></A>subject rightly allowed, and I do not think that any one could have spoken 
<A NAME="300"></A>better or more exhaustively.
<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> There I cannot go along with you. Ancient sages, men 
<A NAME="302"></A>and women, who have spoken and written of these things, would rise up in 
<A NAME="303"></A>judgment against me, if out of complaisance I assented to 
<A NAME="304"></A>you.
<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> Who are they, and where did you hear anything better 
<A NAME="306"></A>than this?
<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I am sure that I must have heard; but at this moment 
<A NAME="308"></A>I do not remember from whom; perhaps from Sappho the fair, or Anacreon 
<A NAME="309"></A>the wise; or, possibly, from a prose writer. Why do I say so? Why, because 
<A NAME="310"></A>I perceive that my bosom is full, and that I could make another speech 
<A NAME="311"></A>as good as that of Lysias, and different. Now I am certain that this is 
<A NAME="312"></A>not an invention of my own, who am well aware that I know nothing, and 
<A NAME="313"></A>therefore I can only infer that I have been filled through the cars, like 
<A NAME="314"></A>a pitcher, from the waters of another, though I have actually forgotten 
<A NAME="315"></A>in my stupidity who was my informant.
<A NAME="316"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> That is grand:-but never mind where you beard the 
<A NAME="317"></A>discourse or from whom; let that be a mystery not to be divulged even at 
<A NAME="318"></A>my earnest desire. Only, as you say, promise to make another and better 
<A NAME="319"></A>oration, equal in length and entirely new, on the same subject; and I, 
<A NAME="320"></A>like the nine Archons, will promise to set up a golden image at Delphi, 
<A NAME="321"></A>not only of myself, but of you, and as large as life.
<A NAME="322"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> You are a dear golden ass if you suppose me to mean 
<A NAME="323"></A>that Lysias has altogether missed the mark, and that I can make a speech 
<A NAME="324"></A>from which all his arguments are to be excluded. The worst of authors will 
<A NAME="325"></A>say something which is to the point. Who, for example, could speak on this 
<A NAME="326"></A>thesis of yours without praising the discretion of the non-lover and blaming 
<A NAME="327"></A>the indiscretion of the lover? These are the commonplaces of the subject 
<A NAME="328"></A>which must come in (for what else is there to be said?) and must be allowed 
<A NAME="329"></A>and excused; the only merit is in the arrangement of them, for there can 
<A NAME="330"></A>be none in the invention; but when you leave the commonplaces, then there 
<A NAME="331"></A>may be some originality.
<A NAME="332"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> I admit that there is reason in what you say, and 
<A NAME="333"></A>I too will be reasonable, and will allow you to start with the premiss 
<A NAME="334"></A>that the lover is more disordered in his wits than the non-lover; if in 
<A NAME="335"></A>what remains you make a longer and better speech than Lysias, and use other 
<A NAME="336"></A>arguments, then I say again, that a statue you shall have of beaten gold, 
<A NAME="337"></A>and take your place by the colossal offerings of the Cypselids at 
<A NAME="338"></A>Olympia.
<A NAME="339"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> How profoundly in earnest is the lover, because to 
<A NAME="340"></A>tease him I lay a finger upon his love! And so, Phaedrus, you really imagine 
<A NAME="341"></A>that I am going to improve upon the ingenuity of Lysias?
<A NAME="342"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> There I have you as you had me, and you must just 
<A NAME="343"></A>speak "as you best can." Do not let us exchange "tu quoque" as in a farce, 
<A NAME="344"></A>or compel me to say to you as you said to me, "I know Socrates as well 
<A NAME="345"></A>as I know myself, and he was wanting to, speak, but he gave himself airs." 
<A NAME="346"></A>Rather I would have you consider that from this place we stir not until 
<A NAME="347"></A>you have unbosomed yourself of the speech; for here are we all alone, and 
<A NAME="348"></A>I am stronger, remember, and younger than you-Wherefore perpend, and do 
<A NAME="349"></A>not compel me to use violence.
<A NAME="350"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But, my sweet Phaedrus, how ridiculous it would be 
<A NAME="351"></A>of me to compete with Lysias in an extempore speech! He is a master in 
<A NAME="352"></A>his art and I am an untaught man.
<A NAME="353"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> You see how matters stand; and therefore let there 
<A NAME="354"></A>be no more pretences; for, indeed, I know the word that is 
<A NAME="355"></A>irresistible.
<A NAME="356"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then don't say it.
<A NAME="357"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> Yes, but I will; and my word shall be an oath. "I 
<A NAME="358"></A>say, or rather swear"-but what god will be witness of my oath?-"By this 
<A NAME="359"></A>plane-tree I swear, that unless you repeat the discourse here in the face 
<A NAME="360"></A>of this very plane-tree, I will never tell you another; never let you have 
<A NAME="361"></A>word of another!"
<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Villain I am conquered; the poor lover of discourse 
<A NAME="363"></A>has no more to say.
<A NAME="364"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> Then why are you still at your 
<A NAME="365"></A>tricks?
<A NAME="366"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I am not going to play tricks now that you have taken 
<A NAME="367"></A>the oath, for I cannot allow myself to be starved.
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> Proceed.
<A NAME="369"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Shall I tell you what I will do?
<A NAME="370"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> What?
<A NAME="371"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I will veil my face and gallop through the discourse 
<A NAME="372"></A>as fast as I can, for if I see you I shall feel ashamed and not know what 
<A NAME="373"></A>to say.
<A NAME="374"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> Only go on and you may do anything else which you 
<A NAME="375"></A>please.
<A NAME="376"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Come, O ye Muses, melodious, as ye are called, whether 
<A NAME="377"></A>you have received this name from the character of your strains, or because 
<A NAME="378"></A>the Melians are a musical race, help, O help me in the tale which my good 
<A NAME="379"></A>friend here desires me to rehearse, in order that his friend whom he always 
<A NAME="380"></A>deemed wise may seem to him to be wiser than ever.
<A NAME="381"></A><BR><BR>Once upon a time there was a fair boy, or, more properly speaking, 
<A NAME="382"></A>a youth; he was very fair and had a great many lovers; and there was one 
<A NAME="383"></A>special cunning one, who had persuaded the youth that he did not love him, 
<A NAME="384"></A>but he really loved him all the same; and one day when he was paying his 
<A NAME="385"></A>addresses to him, he used this very argument-that he ought to accept the 
<A NAME="386"></A>non-lover rather than the lover; his words were as follows:-
<A NAME="387"></A><BR><BR>"All good counsel begins in the same way; a man should know what 
<A NAME="388"></A>he is advising about, or his counsel will all come to nought. But people 
<A NAME="389"></A>imagine that they know about the nature of things, when they don't know 
<A NAME="390"></A>about them, and, not having come to an understanding at first because they 
<A NAME="391"></A>think that they know, they end, as might be expected, in contradicting 
<A NAME="392"></A>one another and themselves. Now you and I must not be guilty of this fundamental 
<A NAME="393"></A>error which we condemn in others; but as our question is whether the lover 
<A NAME="394"></A>or non-lover is to be preferred, let us first of all agree in defining 
<A NAME="395"></A>the nature and power of love, and then, keeping our eyes upon the definition 
<A NAME="396"></A>and to this appealing, let us further enquire whether love brings advantage 
<A NAME="397"></A>or disadvantage.
<A NAME="398"></A><BR><BR>"Every one sees that love is a desire, and we know also that non-lovers 
<A NAME="399"></A>desire the beautiful and good. Now in what way is the lover to be distinguished 
<A NAME="400"></A>from the non-lover? Let us note that in every one of us there are two guiding 
<A NAME="401"></A>and ruling principles which lead us whither they will; one is the natural 
<A NAME="402"></A>desire of pleasure, the other is an acquired opinion which aspires after 
<A NAME="403"></A>the best; and these two are sometimes in harmony and then again at war, 
<A NAME="404"></A>and sometimes the one, sometimes the other conquers. When opinion by the 
<A NAME="405"></A>help of reason leads us to the best, the conquering principle is called 
<A NAME="406"></A>temperance; but when desire, which is devoid of reason, rules in us and 
<A NAME="407"></A>drags us to pleasure, that power of misrule is called excess. Now excess 
<A NAME="408"></A>has many names, and many members, and many forms, and any of these forms 
<A NAME="409"></A>when very marked gives a name, neither honourable nor creditable, to the 
<A NAME="410"></A>bearer of the name. The desire of eating, for example, which gets the better 
<A NAME="411"></A>of the higher reason and the other desires, is called gluttony, and he 
<A NAME="412"></A>who is possessed by it is called a glutton-I the tyrannical desire of drink, 
<A NAME="413"></A>which inclines the possessor of the desire to drink, has a name which is 
<A NAME="414"></A>only too obvious, and there can be as little doubt by what name any other 
<A NAME="415"></A>appetite of the same family would be called;-it will be the name of that 
<A NAME="416"></A>which happens to be eluminant. And now I think that you will perceive the 
<A NAME="417"></A>drift of my discourse; but as every spoken word is in a manner plainer 
<A NAME="418"></A>than the unspoken, I had better say further that the irrational desire 
<A NAME="419"></A>which overcomes the tendency of opinion towards right, and is led away 
<A NAME="420"></A>to the enjoyment of beauty, and especially of personal beauty, by the desires 
<A NAME="421"></A>which are her own kindred-that supreme desire, I say, which by leading 
<A NAME="422"></A>conquers and by the force of passion is reinforced, from this very force, 
<A NAME="423"></A>receiving a name, is called love."
<A NAME="424"></A><BR><BR>And now, dear Phaedrus, I shall pause for an instant to ask whether 
<A NAME="425"></A>you do not think me, as I appear to myself, inspired?
<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> Yes, Socrates, you seem to have a very unusual flow 
<A NAME="427"></A>of words.
<A NAME="428"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Listen to me, then, in silence; for surely the place 
<A NAME="429"></A>is holy; so that you must not wonder, if, as I proceed, I appear to be 
<A NAME="430"></A>in a divine fury, for already I am getting into dithyrambics.
<A NAME="431"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> Nothing can be truer.
<A NAME="432"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> The responsibility rests with you. But hear what follows, 
<A NAME="433"></A>and Perhaps the fit may be averted; all is in their hands above. I will 
<A NAME="434"></A>go on talking to my youth. Listen:
<A NAME="435"></A><BR><BR>Thus, my friend, we have declared and defined the nature of the 
<A NAME="436"></A>subject. Keeping the definition in view, let us now enquire what advantage 
<A NAME="437"></A>or disadvantage is likely to ensue from the lover or the non-lover to him 
<A NAME="438"></A>who accepts their advances.
<A NAME="439"></A><BR><BR>He who is the victim of his passions and the slave of pleasure 
<A NAME="440"></A>will of course desire to make his beloved as agreeable to himself as possible. 
<A NAME="441"></A>Now to him who has a mind discased anything is agreeable which is not opposed 
<A NAME="442"></A>to him, but that which is equal or superior is hateful to him, and therefore 
<A NAME="443"></A>the lover Will not brook any superiority or equality on the part of his 
<A NAME="444"></A>beloved; he is always employed in reducing him to inferiority. And the 
<A NAME="445"></A>ignorant is the inferior of the wise, the coward of the brave, the slow 
<A NAME="446"></A>of speech of the speaker, the dull of the clever. These, and not these 
<A NAME="447"></A>only, are the mental defects of the beloved;-defects which, when implanted 
<A NAME="448"></A>by nature, are necessarily a delight to the lover, and when not implanted, 
<A NAME="449"></A>he must contrive to implant them in him, if he would not be deprived of 
<A NAME="450"></A>his fleeting joy. And therefore he cannot help being jealous, and will 
<A NAME="451"></A>debar his beloved from the advantages of society which would make a man 
<A NAME="452"></A>of him, and especially from that society which would have given him wisdom, 
<A NAME="453"></A>and thereby he cannot fail to do him great harm. That is to say, in his 
<A NAME="454"></A>excessive fear lest he should come to be despised in his eyes he will be 
<A NAME="455"></A>compelled to banish from him divine philosophy; and there is no greater 
<A NAME="456"></A>injury which he can inflict upon him than this. He will contrive that his 
<A NAME="457"></A>beloved shall be wholly ignorant, and in everything shall look to him; 
<A NAME="458"></A>he is to be the delight of the lover's heart, and a curse to himself. Verily, 
<A NAME="459"></A>a lover is a profitable guardian and associate for him in all that relates 
<A NAME="460"></A>to his mind.
<A NAME="461"></A><BR><BR>Let us next see how his master, whose law of life is pleasure and 
<A NAME="462"></A>not good, will keep and train the body of his servant. Will he not choose 
<A NAME="463"></A>a beloved who is delicate rather than sturdy and strong? One brought up 
<A NAME="464"></A>in shady bowers and not in the bright sun, a stranger to manly exercises 
<A NAME="465"></A>and the sweat of toil, accustomed only to a soft and luxurious diet, instead 
<A NAME="466"></A>of the hues of health having the colours of paint and ornament, and the 
<A NAME="467"></A>rest of a piece?-such a life as any one can imagine and which I need not 
<A NAME="468"></A>detail at length. But I may sum up all that I have to say in a word, and 
<A NAME="469"></A>pass on. Such a person in war, or in any of the great crises of life, will 
<A NAME="470"></A>be the anxiety of his friends and also of his lover, and certainly not 
<A NAME="471"></A>the terror of his enemies; which nobody can deny.
<A NAME="472"></A><BR><BR>And now let us tell what advantage or disadvantage the beloved 
<A NAME="473"></A>will receive from the guardianship and society of his lover in the matter 
<A NAME="474"></A>of his property; this is the next point to be considered. The lover will 
<A NAME="475"></A>be the first to see what, indeed, will be sufficiently evident to all men, 
<A NAME="476"></A>that he desires above all things to deprive his beloved of his dearest 
<A NAME="477"></A>and best and holiest possessions, father, mother, kindred, friends, of 
<A NAME="478"></A>all whom he thinks may be hinderers or reprovers of their most sweet converse; 
<A NAME="479"></A>he will even cast a jealous eye upon his gold and silver or other property, 
<A NAME="480"></A>because these make him a less easy prey, and when caught less manageable; 
<A NAME="481"></A>hence he is of necessity displeased at his possession of them and rejoices 
<A NAME="482"></A>at their loss; and he would like him to be wifeless, childless, homeless, 
<A NAME="483"></A>as well; and the longer the better, for the longer he is all this, the 
<A NAME="484"></A>longer he will enjoy him.
<A NAME="485"></A><BR><BR>There are some soft of animals, such as flatterers, who are dangerous 
<A NAME="486"></A>and, mischievous enough, and yet nature has mingled a temporary pleasure 
<A NAME="487"></A>and grace in their composition. You may say that a courtesan is hurtful, 
<A NAME="488"></A>and disapprove of such creatures and their practices, and yet for the time 
<A NAME="489"></A>they are very pleasant. But the lover is not only hurtful to his love; 
<A NAME="490"></A>he is also an extremely disagreeable companion. The old proverb says that 
<A NAME="491"></A>"birds of a feather flock together"; I suppose that equality of years inclines 
<A NAME="492"></A>them to the same pleasures, and similarity begets friendship; yet you may 
<A NAME="493"></A>have more than enough even of this; and verily constraint is always said 
<A NAME="494"></A>to be grievous. Now the lover is not only unlike his beloved, but he forces 
<A NAME="495"></A>himself upon him. For he is old and his love is young, and neither day 
<A NAME="496"></A>nor night will he leave him if he can help; necessity and the sting of 
<A NAME="497"></A>desire drive him on, and allure him with the pleasure which he receives 
<A NAME="498"></A>from seeing, hearing, touching, perceiving him in every way. And therefore 
<A NAME="499"></A>he is delighted to fasten upon him and to minister to him. But what pleasure 
<A NAME="500"></A>or consolation can the beloved be receiving all this time? Must he not 
<A NAME="501"></A>feel the extremity of disgust when he looks at an old shrivelled face and 
<A NAME="502"></A>the remainder to match, which even in a description is disagreeable, and 
<A NAME="503"></A>quite detestable when he is forced into daily contact with his lover; moreover 
<A NAME="504"></A>he is jealously watched and guarded against everything and everybody, and 
<A NAME="505"></A>has to hear misplaced and exaggerated praises of himself, and censures 
<A NAME="506"></A>equally inappropriate, which are intolerable when the man is sober, and, 
<A NAME="507"></A>besides being intolerable, are published all over the world in all their 
<A NAME="508"></A>indelicacy and wearisomeness when he is drunk.
<A NAME="509"></A><BR><BR>And not only while his love continues is he mischievous and unpleasant, 
<A NAME="510"></A>but when his love ceases he becomes a perfidious enemy of him on whom he 
<A NAME="511"></A>showered his oaths and prayers and promises, and yet could hardly prevail 
<A NAME="512"></A>upon him to tolerate the tedium of his company even from motives of interest. 
<A NAME="513"></A>The hour of payment arrives, and now he is the servant of another master; 
<A NAME="514"></A>instead of love and infatuation, wisdom and temperance are his bosom's 
<A NAME="515"></A>lords; but the beloved has not discovered the change which has taken place 
<A NAME="516"></A>in him, when he asks for a return and recalls to his recollection former 
<A NAME="517"></A>sayings and doings; he believes himself to be speaking to the same person, 
<A NAME="518"></A>and the other, not having the courage to confess the truth, and not knowing 
<A NAME="519"></A>how to fulfil the oaths and promises which he made when under the dominion 
<A NAME="520"></A>of folly, and having now grown wise and temperate, does not want to do 
<A NAME="521"></A>as he did or to be as he was before. And so he runs away and is constrained 
<A NAME="522"></A>to be a defaulter; the oyster-shell has fallen with the other side uppermost-he 
<A NAME="523"></A>changes pursuit into flight, while the other is compelled to follow him 
<A NAME="524"></A>with passion and imprecation not knowing that he ought never from the first 
<A NAME="525"></A>to have accepted a demented lover instead of a sensible non-lover; and 
<A NAME="526"></A>that in making such a choice he was giving himself up to a faithless, morose, 
<A NAME="527"></A>envious, disagreeable being, hurtful to his estate, hurtful to his bodily 
<A NAME="528"></A>health, and still more hurtful to the cultivation of his mind, than which 
<A NAME="529"></A>there neither is nor ever will be anything more honoured in the eyes both 
<A NAME="530"></A>of gods and men. Consider this, fair youth, and know that in the friendship 
<A NAME="531"></A>of the lover there is no real kindness; he has an appetite and wants to 
<A NAME="532"></A>feed upon you:
<A NAME="533"></A><BR><BR>As wolves love lambs so lovers love their loves.
<A NAME="534"></A><BR><BR>But I told you so, I am speaking in verse, and therefore I had 
<A NAME="535"></A>better make an end; enough.
<A NAME="536"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> I thought that you were only halfway and were going 
<A NAME="537"></A>to make a similar speech about all the advantages of accepting the non-lover. 
<A NAME="538"></A>Why do you not proceed?
<A NAME="539"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Does not your simplicity observe that I have got out 
<A NAME="540"></A>of dithyrambics into heroics, when only uttering a censure on the lover? 
<A NAME="541"></A>And if I am to add the praises of the non-lover, what will become of me? 
<A NAME="542"></A>Do you not perceive that I am already overtaken by the Nymphs to whom you 
<A NAME="543"></A>have mischievously exposed me? And therefore will only add that the non-lover 
<A NAME="544"></A>has all the advantages in which the lover is accused of being deficient. 
<A NAME="545"></A>And now I will say no more; there has been enough of both of them. Leaving 
<A NAME="546"></A>the tale to its fate, I will cross the river and make the best of my way 
<A NAME="547"></A>home, lest a worse thing be inflicted upon me by you.
<A NAME="548"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> Not yet, Socrates; not until the heat of the day 
<A NAME="549"></A>has passed; do you not see that the hour is almost noon? there is the midday 
<A NAME="550"></A>sun standing still, as people say, in the meridian. Let us rather stay 
<A NAME="551"></A>and talk over what has been said, and then return in the 
<A NAME="552"></A>cool.
<A NAME="553"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Your love of discourse, Phaedrus, is superhuman, simply 
<A NAME="554"></A>marvellous, and I do not believe that there is any one of your contemporaries 
<A NAME="555"></A>who has either made or in one way or another has compelled others to make 
<A NAME="556"></A>an equal number of speeches. I would except Simmias the Theban, but all 
<A NAME="557"></A>the rest are far behind you. And now, I do verily believe that you have 
<A NAME="558"></A>been the cause of another.
<A NAME="559"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> That is good news. But what do you 
<A NAME="560"></A>mean?
<A NAME="561"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I mean to say that as I was about to cross the stream 
<A NAME="562"></A>the usual sign was given to me,-that sign which always forbids, but never 
<A NAME="563"></A>bids, me to do anything which I am going to do; and I thought that I heard 
<A NAME="564"></A>a voice saying in my car that I had been guilty of impiety, and. that I 
<A NAME="565"></A>must not go away until I had made an atonement. Now I am a diviner, though 
<A NAME="566"></A>not a very good one, but I have enough religion for my own use, as you 
<A NAME="567"></A>might say of a bad writer-his writing is good enough for him; and I am 
<A NAME="568"></A>beginning to see that I was in error. O my friend, how prophetic is the 
<A NAME="569"></A>human soul! At the time I had a sort of misgiving, and, like Ibycus, "I 
<A NAME="570"></A>was troubled; I feared that I might be buying honour from men at the price 
<A NAME="571"></A>of sinning against the gods." Now I recognize my error.
<A NAME="572"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> What error?
<A NAME="573"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> That was a dreadful speech which you brought with you, 
<A NAME="574"></A>and you made me utter one as bad.
<A NAME="575"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> How so?
<A NAME="576"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> It was foolish, I say,-to a certain extent, impious; 
<A NAME="577"></A>can anything be more dreadful?
<A NAME="578"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> Nothing, if the speech was really such as you 
<A NAME="579"></A>describe.
<A NAME="580"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Well, and is not Eros the son of Aphrodite, and a 
<A NAME="581"></A>god?
<A NAME="582"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> So men say.
<A NAME="583"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But that was not acknowledged by Lysias in his speech, 
<A NAME="584"></A>nor by you in that other speech which you by a charm drew from my lips. 
<A NAME="585"></A>For if love be, as he surely is, a divinity, he cannot be evil. Yet this 
<A NAME="586"></A>was the error of both the speeches. There was also a simplicity about them 
<A NAME="587"></A>which was refreshing; having no truth or honesty in them, nevertheless 
<A NAME="588"></A>they pretended to be something, hoping to succeed in deceiving the manikins 
<A NAME="589"></A>of earth and gain celebrity among them. Wherefore I must have a purgation. 
<A NAME="590"></A>And I bethink me of an ancient purgation of mythological error which was 
<A NAME="591"></A>devised, not by Homer, for he never had the wit to discover why he was 
<A NAME="592"></A>blind, but by Stesichorus, who was a philosopher and knew the reason why; 
<A NAME="593"></A>and therefore, when he lost his eyes, for that was the penalty which was 
<A NAME="594"></A>inflicted upon him for reviling the lovely Helen, he at once purged himself. 
<A NAME="595"></A>And the purgation was a recantation, which began thus,-
<A NAME="596"></A><BR><BR>False is that word of mine-the truth is that thou didst not embark 
<A NAME="597"></A>in ships, nor ever go to the walls of Troy; and when he had completed his 
<A NAME="598"></A>poem, which is called "the recantation," immediately his sight returned 
<A NAME="599"></A>to him. Now I will be wiser than either Stesichorus or Homer, in that I 
<A NAME="600"></A>am going to make my recantation for reviling love before I suffer; and 
<A NAME="601"></A>this I will attempt, not as before, veiled and ashamed, but with forehead 
<A NAME="602"></A>bold and bare.
<A NAME="603"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> Nothing could be more agreeable to me than to hear 
<A NAME="604"></A>you say so.
<A NAME="605"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Only think, my good Phaedrus, what an utter want of 
<A NAME="606"></A>delicacy was shown in the two discourses; I mean, in my own and in that 
<A NAME="607"></A>which you recited out of the book. Would not any one who was himself of 
<A NAME="608"></A>a noble and gentle nature, and who loved or ever had loved a nature like 
<A NAME="609"></A>his own, when we tell of the petty causes of lovers' jealousies, and of 
<A NAME="610"></A>their exceeding animosities, and of the injuries which they do to their 
<A NAME="611"></A>beloved, have imagined that our ideas of love were taken from some haunt 
<A NAME="612"></A>of sailors to which good manners were unknown-he would certainly never 
<A NAME="613"></A>have admitted the justice of our censure?
<A NAME="614"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> I dare say not, Socrates.
<A NAME="615"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Therefore, because I blush at the thought of this person, 
<A NAME="616"></A>and also because I am afraid of Love himself, I desire to wash the brine 
<A NAME="617"></A>out of my ears with water from the spring; and I would counsel Lysias not 
<A NAME="618"></A>to delay, but to write another discourse, which shall prove that ceteris 
<A NAME="619"></A>paribus the lover ought to be accepted rather than the 
<A NAME="620"></A>non-lover.
<A NAME="621"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> Be assured that he shall. You shall speak the praises 
<A NAME="622"></A>of the lover, and Lysias shall be compelled by me to write another discourse 
<A NAME="623"></A>on the same theme.
<A NAME="624"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> You will be true to your nature in that, and therefore 
<A NAME="625"></A>I believe you.
<A NAME="626"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> Speak, and fear not.
<A NAME="627"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But where is the fair youth whom I was addressing before, 
<A NAME="628"></A>and who ought to listen now; lest, if he hear me not, he should accept 
<A NAME="629"></A>a non-lover before he knows what he is doing?
<A NAME="630"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> He is close at hand, and always at your 
<A NAME="631"></A>service.
<A NAME="632"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Know then, fair youth, that the former discourse was 
<A NAME="633"></A>the word of Phaedrus, the son of Vain Man, who dwells in the city of Myrrhina 
<A NAME="634"></A>(Myrrhinusius). And this which I am about to utter is the recantation of 
<A NAME="635"></A>Stesichorus the son of Godly Man (Euphemus), who comes from the town of 
<A NAME="636"></A>Desire (Himera), and is to the following effect: "I told a lie when I said" 
<A NAME="637"></A>that the beloved ought to accept the non-lover when he might have the lover, 
<A NAME="638"></A>because the one is sane, and the other mad. It might be so if madness were 
<A NAME="639"></A>simply an evil; but there is also a madness which is a divine gift, and 
<A NAME="640"></A>the source of the chiefest blessings granted to men. For prophecy is a 
<A NAME="641"></A>madness, and the prophetess at Delphi and the priestesses at Dodona when 
<A NAME="642"></A>out of their senses have conferred great benefits on Hellas, both in public 
<A NAME="643"></A>and private life, but when in their senses few or none. And I might also 
<A NAME="644"></A>tell you how the Sibyl and other inspired persons have given to many an 
<A NAME="645"></A>one many an intimation of the future which has saved them from falling. 
<A NAME="646"></A>But it would be tedious to speak of what every one knows.
<A NAME="647"></A><BR><BR>There will be more reason in appealing to the ancient inventors 
<A NAME="648"></A>of names, who would never have connected prophecy (mantike) which foretells 
<A NAME="649"></A>the future and is the noblest of arts, with madness (manike), or called 
<A NAME="650"></A>them both by the same name, if they had deemed madness to be a disgrace 
<A NAME="651"></A>or dishonour;-they must have thought that there was an inspired madness 
<A NAME="652"></A>which was a noble thing; for the two words, mantike and manike, are really 
<A NAME="653"></A>the same, and the letter t is only a modern and tasteless insertion. And 
<A NAME="654"></A>this is confirmed by the name which was given by them to the rational investigation 
<A NAME="655"></A>of futurity, whether made by the help of birds or of other signs-this, 
<A NAME="656"></A>for as much as it is an art which supplies from the reasoning faculty mind 
<A NAME="657"></A>(nous) and information (istoria) to human thought (oiesis) they originally 
<A NAME="658"></A>termed oionoistike, but the word has been lately altered and made sonorous 
<A NAME="659"></A>by the modern introduction of the letter Omega (oionoistike and oionistike), 
<A NAME="660"></A>and in proportion prophecy (mantike) is more perfect and august than augury, 
<A NAME="661"></A>both in name and fact, in the same proportion, as the ancients testify, 
<A NAME="662"></A>is madness superior to a sane mind (sophrosune) for the one is only of 
<A NAME="663"></A>human, but the other of divine origin. Again, where plagues and mightiest 
<A NAME="664"></A>woes have bred in certain families, owing to some ancient blood-guiltiness, 
<A NAME="665"></A>there madness has entered with holy prayers and rites, and by inspired 
<A NAME="666"></A>utterances found a way of deliverance for those who are in need; and he 
<A NAME="667"></A>who has part in this gift, and is truly possessed and duly out of his mind, 
<A NAME="668"></A>is by the use of purifications and mysteries made whole and except from 
<A NAME="669"></A>evil, future as well as present, and has a release from the calamity which 
<A NAME="670"></A>was afflicting him. The third kind is the madness of those who are possessed 
<A NAME="671"></A>by the Muses; which taking hold of a delicate and virgin soul, and there 
<A NAME="672"></A>inspiring frenzy, awakens lyrical and all other numbers; with these adorning 
<A NAME="673"></A>the myriad actions of ancient heroes for the instruction of posterity. 
<A NAME="674"></A>But he who, having no touch of the Muses' madness in his soul, comes to 
<A NAME="675"></A>the door and thinks that he will get into the temple by the help of art-he, 
<A NAME="676"></A>I say, and his poetry are not admitted; the sane man disappears and is 
<A NAME="677"></A>nowhere when he enters into rivalry with the madman.
<A NAME="678"></A><BR><BR>I might tell of many other noble deeds which have sprung from inspired 
<A NAME="679"></A>madness. And therefore, let no one frighten or flutter us by saying that 
<A NAME="680"></A>the temperate friend is to be chosen rather than the inspired, but let 
<A NAME="681"></A>him further show that love is not sent by the gods for any good to lover 
<A NAME="682"></A>or beloved; if he can do so we will allow him to carry off the palm. And 
<A NAME="683"></A>we, on our part, will prove in answer to him that the madness of love is 
<A NAME="684"></A>the greatest of heaven's blessings, and the proof shall be one which the 
<A NAME="685"></A>wise will receive, and the witling disbelieve. But first of all, let us 
<A NAME="686"></A>view the affections and actions of the soul divine and human, and try to 
<A NAME="687"></A>ascertain the truth about them. The beginning of our proof is as 
<A NAME="688"></A>follows:-
<A NAME="689"></A><BR><BR>The soul through all her being is immortal, for that which is ever 
<A NAME="690"></A>in motion is immortal; but that which moves another and is moved by another, 
<A NAME="691"></A>in ceasing to move ceases also to live. Only the self-moving, never leaving 
<A NAME="692"></A>self, never ceases to move, and is the fountain and beginning of motion 
<A NAME="693"></A>to all that moves besides. Now, the beginning is unbegotten, for that which 
<A NAME="694"></A>is begotten has a beginning; but the beginning is begotten of nothing, 
<A NAME="695"></A>for if it were begotten of something, then the begotten would not come 
<A NAME="696"></A>from a beginning. But if unbegotten, it must also be indestructible; for 
<A NAME="697"></A>if beginning were destroyed, there could be no beginning out of anything, 
<A NAME="698"></A>nor anything out of a beginning; and all things must have a beginning. 
<A NAME="699"></A>And therefore the self-moving is the beginning of motion; and this can 
<A NAME="700"></A>neither be destroyed nor begotten, else the whole heavens and all creation 
<A NAME="701"></A>would collapse and stand still, and never again have motion or birth. But 
<A NAME="702"></A>if the self-moving is proved to be immortal, he who affirms that self-motion 
<A NAME="703"></A>is the very idea and essence of the soul will not be put to confusion. 
<A NAME="704"></A>For the body which is moved from without is soulless; but that which is 
<A NAME="705"></A>moved from within has a soul, for such is the nature of the soul. But if 
<A NAME="706"></A>this be true, must not the soul be the self-moving, and therefore of necessity 
<A NAME="707"></A>unbegotten and immortal? Enough of the soul's immortality.
<A NAME="708"></A><BR><BR>Of the nature of the soul, though her true form be ever a theme 
<A NAME="709"></A>of large and more than mortal discourse, let me speak briefly, and in a 
<A NAME="710"></A>figure. And let the figure be composite-a pair of winged horses and a charioteer. 
<A NAME="711"></A>Now the winged horses and the charioteers of the gods are all of them noble 
<A NAME="712"></A>and of noble descent, but those of other races are mixed; the human charioteer 
<A NAME="713"></A>drives his in a pair; and one of them is noble and of noble breed, and 
<A NAME="714"></A>the other is ignoble and of ignoble breed; and the driving of them of necessity 
<A NAME="715"></A>gives a great deal of trouble to him. I will endeavour to explain to you 
<A NAME="716"></A>in what way the mortal differs from the immortal creature. The soul in 
<A NAME="717"></A>her totality has the care of inanimate being everywhere, and traverses 
<A NAME="718"></A>the whole heaven in divers forms appearing--when perfect and fully winged 
<A NAME="719"></A>she soars upward, and orders the whole world; whereas the imperfect soul, 
<A NAME="720"></A>losing her wings and drooping in her flight at last settles on the solid 
<A NAME="721"></A>ground-there, finding a home, she receives an earthly frame which appears 
<A NAME="722"></A>to be self-moved, but is really moved by her power; and this composition 
<A NAME="723"></A>of soul and body is called a living and mortal creature. For immortal no 
<A NAME="724"></A>such union can be reasonably believed to be; although fancy, not having 
<A NAME="725"></A>seen nor surely known the nature of God, may imagine an immortal creature 
<A NAME="726"></A>having both a body and also a soul which are united throughout all time. 
<A NAME="727"></A>Let that, however, be as God wills, and be spoken of acceptably to him. 
<A NAME="728"></A>And now let us ask the reason why the soul loses her 
<A NAME="729"></A>wings!
<A NAME="730"></A><BR><BR>The wing is the corporeal element which is most akin to the divine, 
<A NAME="731"></A>and which by nature tends to soar aloft and carry that which gravitates 
<A NAME="732"></A>downwards into the upper region, which is the habitation of the gods. The 
<A NAME="733"></A>divine is beauty, wisdom, goodness, and the like; and by these the wing 
<A NAME="734"></A>of the soul is nourished, and grows apace; but when fed upon evil and foulness 
<A NAME="735"></A>and the opposite of good, wastes and falls away. Zeus, the mighty lord, 
<A NAME="736"></A>holding the reins of a winged chariot, leads the way in heaven, ordering 
<A NAME="737"></A>all and taking care of all; and there follows him the array of gods and 
<A NAME="738"></A>demigods, marshalled in eleven bands; Hestia alone abides at home in the 
<A NAME="739"></A>house of heaven; of the rest they who are reckoned among the princely twelve 
<A NAME="740"></A>march in their appointed order. They see many blessed sights in the inner 
<A NAME="741"></A>heaven, and there are many ways to and fro, along which the blessed gods 
<A NAME="742"></A>are passing, every one doing his own work; he may follow who will and can, 
<A NAME="743"></A>for jealousy has no place in the celestial choir. But when they go to banquet 
<A NAME="744"></A>and festival, then they move up the steep to the top of the vault of heaven. 
<A NAME="745"></A>The chariots of the gods in even poise, obeying the rein, glide rapidly; 
<A NAME="746"></A>but the others labour, for the vicious steed goes heavily, weighing down 
<A NAME="747"></A>the charioteer to the earth when his steed has not been thoroughly trained:-and 
<A NAME="748"></A>this is the hour of agony and extremest conflict for the soul. For the 
<A NAME="749"></A>immortals, when they are at the end of their course, go forth and stand 
<A NAME="750"></A>upon the outside of heaven, and the revolution of the spheres carries them 
<A NAME="751"></A>round, and they behold the things beyond. But of the heaven which is above 
<A NAME="752"></A>the heavens, what earthly poet ever did or ever will sing worthily? It 
<A NAME="753"></A>is such as I will describe; for I must dare to speak the truth, when truth 
<A NAME="754"></A>is my theme. There abides the very being with which true knowledge is concerned; 
<A NAME="755"></A>the colourless, formless, intangible essence, visible only to mind, the 
<A NAME="756"></A>pilot of the soul. The divine intelligence, being nurtured upon mind and 
<A NAME="757"></A>pure knowledge, and the intelligence of every soul which is capable of 
<A NAME="758"></A>receiving the food proper to it, rejoices at beholding reality, and once 
<A NAME="759"></A>more gazing upon truth, is replenished and made glad, until the revolution 
<A NAME="760"></A>of the worlds brings her round again to the same place. In the revolution 
<A NAME="761"></A>she beholds justice, and temperance, and knowledge absolute, not in the 
<A NAME="762"></A>form of generation or of relation, which men call existence, but knowledge 
<A NAME="763"></A>absolute in existence absolute; and beholding the other true existences 
<A NAME="764"></A>in like manner, and feasting upon them, she passes down into the interior 
<A NAME="765"></A>of the heavens and returns home; and there the charioteer putting up his 
<A NAME="766"></A>horses at the stall, gives them ambrosia to eat and nectar to 
<A NAME="767"></A>drink.
<A NAME="768"></A><BR><BR>Such is the life of the gods; but of other souls, that which follows 
<A NAME="769"></A>God best and is likest to him lifts the head of the charioteer into the 
<A NAME="770"></A>outer world, and is carried round in the revolution, troubled indeed by 
<A NAME="771"></A>the steeds, and with difficulty beholding true being; while another only 
<A NAME="772"></A>rises and falls, and sees, and again fails to see by reason of the unruliness 
<A NAME="773"></A>of the steeds. The rest of the souls are also longing after the upper world 
<A NAME="774"></A>and they all follow, but not being strong enough they are carried round 
<A NAME="775"></A>below the surface, plunging, treading on one another, each striving to 
<A NAME="776"></A>be first; and there is confusion and perspiration and the extremity of 
<A NAME="777"></A>effort; and many of them are lamed or have their wings broken through the 
<A NAME="778"></A>ill-driving of the charioteers; and all of them after a fruitless toil, 
<A NAME="779"></A>not having attained to the mysteries of true being, go away, and feed upon 
<A NAME="780"></A>opinion. The reason why the souls exhibit this exceeding eagerness to behold 
<A NAME="781"></A>the plain of truth is that pasturage is found there, which is suited to 
<A NAME="782"></A>the highest part of the soul; and the wing on which the soul soars is nourished 
<A NAME="783"></A>with this. And there is a law of Destiny, that the soul which attains any 
<A NAME="784"></A>vision of truth in company with a god is preserved from harm until the 
<A NAME="785"></A>next period, and if attaining always is always unharmed. But when she is 
<A NAME="786"></A>unable to follow, and fails to behold the truth, and through some ill-hap 
<A NAME="787"></A>sinks beneath the double load of forgetfulness and vice, and her wings 
<A NAME="788"></A>fall from her and she drops to the ground, then the law ordains that this 
<A NAME="789"></A>soul shall at her first birth pass, not into any other animal, but only 
<A NAME="790"></A>into man; and the soul which has seen most of truth shall come to the birth 
<A NAME="791"></A>as a philosopher, or artist, or some musical and loving nature; that which 
<A NAME="792"></A>has seen truth in the second degree shall be some righteous king or warrior 
<A NAME="793"></A>chief; the soul which is of the third class shall be a politician, or economist, 
<A NAME="794"></A>or trader; the fourth shall be lover of gymnastic toils, or a physician; 
<A NAME="795"></A>the fifth shall lead the life of a prophet or hierophant; to the sixth 
<A NAME="796"></A>the character of poet or some other imitative artist will be assigned; 
<A NAME="797"></A>to the seventh the life of an artisan or husbandman; to the eighth that 
<A NAME="798"></A>of a sophist or demagogue; to the ninth that of a tyrant-all these are 
<A NAME="799"></A>states of probation, in which he who does righteously improves, and he 
<A NAME="800"></A>who does unrighteously, improves, and he who does unrighteously, deteriorates 
<A NAME="801"></A>his lot.
<A NAME="802"></A><BR><BR>Ten thousand years must elapse before the soul of each one can 
<A NAME="803"></A>return to the place from whence she came, for she cannot grow her wings 
<A NAME="804"></A>in less; only the soul of a philosopher, guileless and true, or the soul 
<A NAME="805"></A>of a lover, who is not devoid of philosophy, may acquire wings in the third 
<A NAME="806"></A>of the recurring periods of a thousand years; he is distinguished from 
<A NAME="807"></A>the ordinary good man who gains wings in three thousand years:-and they 
<A NAME="808"></A>who choose this life three times in succession have wings given them, and 
<A NAME="809"></A>go away at the end of three thousand years. But the others receive judgment 
<A NAME="810"></A>when they have completed their first life, and after the judgment they 
<A NAME="811"></A>go, some of them to the houses of correction which are under the earth, 
<A NAME="812"></A>and are punished; others to some place in heaven whither they are lightly 
<A NAME="813"></A>borne by justice, and there they live in a manner worthy of the life which 
<A NAME="814"></A>they led here when in the form of men. And at the end of the first thousand 
<A NAME="815"></A>years the good souls and also the evil souls both come to draw lots and 
<A NAME="816"></A>choose their second life, and they may take any which they please. The 
<A NAME="817"></A>soul of a man may pass into the life of a beast, or from the beast return 
<A NAME="818"></A>again into the man. But the soul which has never seen the truth will not 
<A NAME="819"></A>pass into the human form. For a man must have intelligence of universals, 
<A NAME="820"></A>and be able to proceed from the many particulars of sense to one conception 
<A NAME="821"></A>of reason;-this is the recollection of those things which our soul once 
<A NAME="822"></A>saw while following God-when regardless of that which we now call being 
<A NAME="823"></A>she raised her head up towards the true being. And therefore the mind of 
<A NAME="824"></A>the philosopher alone has wings; and this is just, for he is always, according 
<A NAME="825"></A>to the measure of his abilities, clinging in recollection to those things 
<A NAME="826"></A>in which God abides, and in beholding which He is what He is. And he who 
<A NAME="827"></A>employs aright these memories is ever being initiated into perfect mysteries 
<A NAME="828"></A>and alone becomes truly perfect. But, as he forgets earthly interests and 
<A NAME="829"></A>is rapt in the divine, the vulgar deem him mad, and rebuke him; they do 
<A NAME="830"></A>not see that he is inspired.
<A NAME="831"></A><BR><BR>Thus far I have been speaking of the fourth and last kind of madness, 
<A NAME="832"></A>which is imputed to him who, when he sees the beauty of earth, is transported 
<A NAME="833"></A>with the recollection of the true beauty; he would like to fly away, but 
<A NAME="834"></A>he cannot; he is like a bird fluttering and looking upward and careless 
<A NAME="835"></A>of the world below; and he is therefore thought to be mad. And I have shown 
<A NAME="836"></A>this of all inspirations to be the noblest and highest and the offspring 
<A NAME="837"></A>of the highest to him who has or shares in it, and that he who loves the 
<A NAME="838"></A>beautiful is called a lover because he partakes of it. For, as has been 
<A NAME="839"></A>already said, every soul of man has in the way of nature beheld true being; 
<A NAME="840"></A>this was the condition of her passing into the form of man. But all souls 
<A NAME="841"></A>do not easily recall the things of the other world; they may have seen 
<A NAME="842"></A>them for a short time only, or they may have been unfortunate in their 
<A NAME="843"></A>earthly lot, and, having had their hearts turned to unrighteousness through 
<A NAME="844"></A>some corrupting influence, they may have lost the memory of the holy things 
<A NAME="845"></A>which once they saw. Few only retain an adequate remembrance of them; and 
<A NAME="846"></A>they, when they behold here any image of that other world, are rapt in 
<A NAME="847"></A>amazement; but they are ignorant of what this rapture means, because they 
<A NAME="848"></A>do not clearly perceive. For there is no light of justice or temperance 
<A NAME="849"></A>or any of the higher ideas which are precious to souls in the earthly copies 
<A NAME="850"></A>of them: they are seen through a glass dimly; and there are few who, going 
<A NAME="851"></A>to the images, behold in them the realities, and these only with difficulty. 
<A NAME="852"></A>There was a time when with the rest of the happy band they saw beauty shining 
<A NAME="853"></A>in brightness-we philosophers following in the train of Zeus, others in 
<A NAME="854"></A>company with other gods; and then we beheld the beatific vision and were 
<A NAME="855"></A>initiated into a mystery which may be truly called most blessed, celebrated 
<A NAME="856"></A>by us in our state of innocence, before we had any experience of evils 
<A NAME="857"></A>to come, when we were admitted to the sight of apparitions innocent and 
<A NAME="858"></A>simple and calm and happy, which we beheld shining impure light, pure ourselves 
<A NAME="859"></A>and not yet enshrined in that living tomb which we carry about, now that 
<A NAME="860"></A>we are imprisoned in the body, like an oyster in his shell. Let me linger 
<A NAME="861"></A>over the memory of scenes which have passed away.
<A NAME="862"></A><BR><BR>But of beauty, I repeat again that we saw her there shining in 
<A NAME="863"></A>company with the celestial forms; and coming to earth we find her here 
<A NAME="864"></A>too, shining in clearness through the clearest aperture of sense. For sight 
<A NAME="865"></A>is the most piercing of our bodily senses; though not by that is wisdom 
<A NAME="866"></A>seen; her loveliness would have been transporting if there had been a visible 
<A NAME="867"></A>image of her, and the other ideas, if they had visible counterparts, would 
<A NAME="868"></A>be equally lovely. But this is the privilege of beauty, that being the 
<A NAME="869"></A>loveliest she is also the most palpable to sight. Now he who is not newly 
<A NAME="870"></A>initiated or who has become corrupted, does not easily rise out of this 
<A NAME="871"></A>world to the sight of true beauty in the other; he looks only at her earthly 
<A NAME="872"></A>namesake, and instead of being awed at the sight of her, he is given over 
<A NAME="873"></A>to pleasure, and like a brutish beast he rushes on to enjoy and beget; 
<A NAME="874"></A>he consorts with wantonness, and is not afraid or ashamed of pursuing pleasure 
<A NAME="875"></A>in violation of nature. But he whose initiation is recent, and who has 
<A NAME="876"></A>been the spectator of many glories in the other world, is amazed when he 
<A NAME="877"></A>sees any one having a godlike face or form, which is the expression of 
<A NAME="878"></A>divine beauty; and at first a shudder runs through him, and again the old 
<A NAME="879"></A>awe steals over him; then looking upon the face of his beloved as of a 
<A NAME="880"></A>god he reverences him, and if he were not afraid of being thought a downright 
<A NAME="881"></A>madman, he would sacrifice to his beloved as to the image of a god; then 
<A NAME="882"></A>while he gazes on him there is a sort of reaction, and the shudder passes 
<A NAME="883"></A>into an unusual heat and perspiration; for, as he receives the effluence 
<A NAME="884"></A>of beauty through the eyes, the wing moistens and he warms. And as he warms, 
<A NAME="885"></A>the parts out of which the wing grew, and which had been hitherto closed 
<A NAME="886"></A>and rigid, and had prevented the wing from shooting forth, are melted, 
<A NAME="887"></A>and as nourishment streams upon him, the lower end of the wings begins 
<A NAME="888"></A>to swell and grow from the root upwards; and the growth extends under the 
<A NAME="889"></A>whole soul-for once the whole was winged.
<A NAME="890"></A><BR><BR>During this process the whole soul is all in a state of ebullition 
<A NAME="891"></A>and effervescence,-which may be compared to the irritation and uneasiness 
<A NAME="892"></A>in the gums at the time of cutting teeth,-bubbles up, and has a feeling 
<A NAME="893"></A>of uneasiness and tickling; but when in like manner the soul is beginning 
<A NAME="894"></A>to grow wings, the beauty of the beloved meets her eye and she receives 
<A NAME="895"></A>the sensible warm motion of particles which flow towards her, therefore 
<A NAME="896"></A>called emotion (imeros), and is refreshed and warmed by them, and then 
<A NAME="897"></A>she ceases from her pain with joy. But when she is parted from her beloved 
<A NAME="898"></A>and her moisture fails, then the orifices of the passage out of which the 
<A NAME="899"></A>wing shoots dry up and close, and intercept the germ of the wing; which, 
<A NAME="900"></A>being shut up with the emotion, throbbing as with the pulsations of an 
<A NAME="901"></A>artery, pricks the aperture which is nearest, until at length the entire 
<A NAME="902"></A>soul is pierced and maddened and pained, and at the recollection of beauty 
<A NAME="903"></A>is again delighted. And from both of them together the soul is oppressed 
<A NAME="904"></A>at the strangeness of her condition, and is in a great strait and excitement, 
<A NAME="905"></A>and in her madness can neither sleep by night nor abide in her place by 
<A NAME="906"></A>day. And wherever she thinks that she will behold the beautiful one, thither 
<A NAME="907"></A>in her desire she runs. And when she has seen him, and bathed herself in 
<A NAME="908"></A>the waters of beauty, her constraint is loosened, and she is refreshed, 
<A NAME="909"></A>and has no more pangs and pains; and this is the sweetest of all pleasures 
<A NAME="910"></A>at the time, and is the reason why the soul of the lover will never forsake 
<A NAME="911"></A>his beautiful one, whom he esteems above all; he has forgotten mother and 
<A NAME="912"></A>brethren and companions, and he thinks nothing of the neglect and loss 
<A NAME="913"></A>of his property; the rules and proprieties of life, on which he formerly 
<A NAME="914"></A>prided himself, he now despises, and is ready to sleep like a servant, 
<A NAME="915"></A>wherever he is allowed, as near as he can to his desired one, who is the 
<A NAME="916"></A>object of his worship, and the physician who can alone assuage the greatness 
<A NAME="917"></A>of his pain. And this state, my dear imaginary youth to whom I am talking, 
<A NAME="918"></A>is by men called love, and among the gods has a name at which you, in your 
<A NAME="919"></A>simplicity, may be inclined to mock; there are two lines in the apocryphal 
<A NAME="920"></A>writings of Homer in which the name occurs. One of them is rather outrageous, 
<A NAME="921"></A>and not altogether metrical. They are as follows:
<A NAME="922"></A><BR><BR>Mortals call him fluttering love,
<A NAME="923"></A><BR>But the immortals call him winged one,
<A NAME="924"></A><BR>Because the growing of wings is a necessity to him. You may believe 
<A NAME="925"></A>this, but not unless you like. At any rate the loves of lovers and their 
<A NAME="926"></A>causes are such as I have described.
<A NAME="927"></A><BR><BR>Now the lover who is taken to be the attendant of Zeus is better 
<A NAME="928"></A>able to bear the winged god, and can endure a heavier burden; but the attendants 
<A NAME="929"></A>and companions of Ares, when under the influence of love, if they fancy 
<A NAME="930"></A>that they have been at all wronged, are ready to kill and put an end to 
<A NAME="931"></A>themselves and their beloved. And he who follows in the train of any other 
<A NAME="932"></A>god, while he is unspoiled and the impression lasts, honours and imitates 
<A NAME="933"></A>him, as far as he is able; and after the manner of his god he behaves in 
<A NAME="934"></A>his intercourse with his beloved and with the rest of the world during 
<A NAME="935"></A>the first period of his earthly existence. Every one chooses his love from 
<A NAME="936"></A>the ranks of beauty according to his character, and this he makes his god, 
<A NAME="937"></A>and fashions and adorns as a sort of image which he is to fall down and 
<A NAME="938"></A>worship. The followers of Zeus desire that their beloved should have a 
<A NAME="939"></A>soul like him; and therefore they seek out some one of a philosophical 
<A NAME="940"></A>and imperial nature, and when they have found him and loved him, they do 
<A NAME="941"></A>all they can to confirm such a nature in him, and if they have no experience 
<A NAME="942"></A>of such a disposition hitherto, they learn of any one who can teach them, 
<A NAME="943"></A>and themselves follow in the same way. And they have the less difficulty 
<A NAME="944"></A>in finding the nature of their own god in themselves, because they have 
<A NAME="945"></A>been compelled to gaze intensely on him; their recollection clings to him, 
<A NAME="946"></A>and they become possessed of him, and receive from him their character 
<A NAME="947"></A>and disposition, so far as man can participate in God. The qualities of 
<A NAME="948"></A>their god they attribute to the beloved, wherefore they love him all the 
<A NAME="949"></A>more, and if, like the Bacchic Nymphs, they draw inspiration from Zeus, 
<A NAME="950"></A>they pour out their own fountain upon him, wanting to make him as like 
<A NAME="951"></A>as possible to their own god. But those who are the followers of Here seek 
<A NAME="952"></A>a royal love, and when they have found him they do just the same with him; 
<A NAME="953"></A>and in like manner the followers of Apollo, and of every other god walking 
<A NAME="954"></A>in the ways of their god, seek a love who is to be made like him whom they 
<A NAME="955"></A>serve, and when they have found him, they themselves imitate their god, 
<A NAME="956"></A>and persuade their love to do the same, and educate him into the manner 
<A NAME="957"></A>and nature of the god as far as they each can; for no feelings of envy 
<A NAME="958"></A>or jealousy are entertained by them towards their beloved, but they do 
<A NAME="959"></A>their utmost to create in him the greatest likeness of themselves and of 
<A NAME="960"></A>the god whom they honour. Thus fair and blissful to the beloved is the 
<A NAME="961"></A>desire of the inspired lover, and the initiation of which I speak into 
<A NAME="962"></A>the mysteries of true love, if he be captured by the lover and their purpose 
<A NAME="963"></A>is effected. Now the beloved is taken captive in the following 
<A NAME="964"></A>manner:-
<A NAME="965"></A><BR><BR>As I said at the beginning of this tale, I divided each soul into 
<A NAME="966"></A>three-two horses and a charioteer; and one of the horses was good and the 
<A NAME="967"></A>other bad: the division may remain, but I have not yet explained in what 
<A NAME="968"></A>the goodness or badness of either consists, and to that I will proceed. 
<A NAME="969"></A>The right-hand horse is upright and cleanly made; he has a lofty neck and 
<A NAME="970"></A>an aquiline nose; his colour is white, and his eyes dark; he is a lover 
<A NAME="971"></A>of honour and modesty and temperance, and the follower of true glory; he 
<A NAME="972"></A>needs no touch of the whip, but is guided by word and admonition only. 
<A NAME="973"></A>The other is a crooked lumbering animal, put together anyhow; he has a 
<A NAME="974"></A>short thick neck; he is flat-faced and of a dark colour, with grey eyes 
<A NAME="975"></A>and blood-red complexion; the mate of insolence and pride, shag-eared and 
<A NAME="976"></A>deaf, hardly yielding to whip and spur. Now when the charioteer beholds 
<A NAME="977"></A>the vision of love, and has his whole soul warmed through sense, and is 
<A NAME="978"></A>full of the prickings and ticklings of desire, the obedient steed, then 
<A NAME="979"></A>as always under the government of shame, refrains from leaping on the beloved; 
<A NAME="980"></A>but the other, heedless of the pricks and of the blows of the whip, plunges 
<A NAME="981"></A>and runs away, giving all manner of trouble to his companion and the charioteer, 
<A NAME="982"></A>whom he forces to approach the beloved and to remember the joys of love. 
<A NAME="983"></A>They at first indignantly oppose him and will not be urged on to do terrible 
<A NAME="984"></A>and unlawful deeds; but at last, when he persists in plaguing them, they 
<A NAME="985"></A>yield and agree to do as he bids them.
<A NAME="986"></A><BR><BR>And now they are at the spot and behold the flashing beauty of 
<A NAME="987"></A>the beloved; which when the charioteer sees, his memory is carried to the 
<A NAME="988"></A>true beauty, whom he beholds in company with Modesty like an image placed 
<A NAME="989"></A>upon a holy pedestal. He sees her, but he is afraid and falls backwards 
<A NAME="990"></A>in adoration, and by his fall is compelled to pull back the reins with 
<A NAME="991"></A>such violence as to bring both the steeds on their haunches, the one willing 
<A NAME="992"></A>and unresisting, the unruly one very unwilling; and when they have gone 
<A NAME="993"></A>back a little, the one is overcome with shame and wonder, and his whole 
<A NAME="994"></A>soul is bathed in perspiration; the other, when the pain is over which 
<A NAME="995"></A>the bridle and the fall had given him, having with difficulty taken breath, 
<A NAME="996"></A>is full of wrath and reproaches, which he heaps upon the charioteer and 
<A NAME="997"></A>his fellow-steed, for want of courage and manhood, declaring that they 
<A NAME="998"></A>have been false to their agreement and guilty of desertion. Again they 
<A NAME="999"></A>refuse, and again he urges them on, and will scarce yield to their prayer 
<A NAME="1000"></A>that he would wait until another time. When the appointed hour comes, they 
<A NAME="1001"></A>make as if they had forgotten, and he reminds them, fighting and neighing 
<A NAME="1002"></A>and dragging them on, until at length he, on the same thoughts intent, 
<A NAME="1003"></A>forces them to draw near again. And when they are near he stoops his head 
<A NAME="1004"></A>and puts up his tail, and takes the bit in his teeth. and pulls shamelessly. 
<A NAME="1005"></A>Then the charioteer is. worse off than ever; he falls back like a racer 
<A NAME="1006"></A>at the barrier, and with a still more violent wrench drags the bit out 
<A NAME="1007"></A>of the teeth of the wild steed and covers his abusive tongue and-jaws with 
<A NAME="1008"></A>blood, and forces his legs and haunches to the ground and punishes him 
<A NAME="1009"></A>sorely. And when this has happened several times and the villain has ceased 
<A NAME="1010"></A>from his wanton way, he is tamed and humbled, and follows the will of the 
<A NAME="1011"></A>charioteer, and when he sees the beautiful one he is ready to die of fear. 
<A NAME="1012"></A>And from that time forward the soul of the lover follows the beloved in 
<A NAME="1013"></A>modesty and holy fear.
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR><BR>And so the beloved who, like a god, has received every true and 
<A NAME="1015"></A>loyal service from his lover, not in pretence but in reality, being also 
<A NAME="1016"></A>himself of a nature friendly to his admirer, if in former days he has blushed 
<A NAME="1017"></A>to own his passion and turned away his lover, because his youthful companions 
<A NAME="1018"></A>or others slanderously told him that he would be disgraced, now as years 
<A NAME="1019"></A>advance, at the appointed age and time, is led to receive him into communion. 
<A NAME="1020"></A>For fate which has ordained that there shall be no friendship among the 
<A NAME="1021"></A>evil has also ordained that there shall ever be friendship among the good. 
<A NAME="1022"></A>And the beloved when he has received him into communion and intimacy, is 
<A NAME="1023"></A>quite amazed at the good-will of the lover; he recognises that the inspired 
<A NAME="1024"></A>friend is worth all other friends or kinsmen; they have nothing of friendship 
<A NAME="1025"></A>in them worthy to be compared with his. And when his feeling continues 
<A NAME="1026"></A>and he is nearer to him and embraces him, in gymnastic exercises and at 
<A NAME="1027"></A>other times of meeting, then the fountain of that stream, which Zeus when 
<A NAME="1028"></A>he was in love with Ganymede named Desire, overflows upon the lover, and 
<A NAME="1029"></A>some enters into his soul, and some when he is filled flows out again; 
<A NAME="1030"></A>and as a breeze or an echo rebounds from the smooth rocks and returns whence 
<A NAME="1031"></A>it came, so does the stream of beauty, passing through the eyes which are 
<A NAME="1032"></A>the windows of the soul, come back to the beautiful one; there arriving 
<A NAME="1033"></A>and quickening the passages of the wings, watering. them and inclining 
<A NAME="1034"></A>them to grow, and filling the soul of the beloved also with love. And thus 
<A NAME="1035"></A>he loves, but he knows not what; he does not understand and cannot explain 
<A NAME="1036"></A>his own state; he appears to have caught the infection of blindness from 
<A NAME="1037"></A>another; the lover is his mirror in whom he is beholding himself, but he 
<A NAME="1038"></A>is not aware of this. When he is with the lover, both cease from their 
<A NAME="1039"></A>pain, but when he is away then he longs as he is longed for, and has love's 
<A NAME="1040"></A>image, love for love (Anteros) lodging in his breast, which he calls and 
<A NAME="1041"></A>believes to be not love but friendship only, and his desire is as the desire 
<A NAME="1042"></A>of the other, but weaker; he wants to see him, touch him, kiss him, embrace 
<A NAME="1043"></A>him, and probably not long afterwards his desire is accomplished. When 
<A NAME="1044"></A>they meet, the wanton steed of the lover has a word to say to the charioteer; 
<A NAME="1045"></A>he would like to have a little pleasure in return for many pains, but the 
<A NAME="1046"></A>wanton steed of the beloved says not a word, for he is bursting with passion 
<A NAME="1047"></A>which he understands not;-he throws his arms round the lover and embraces 
<A NAME="1048"></A>him as his dearest friend; and, when they are side by side, he is not in 
<A NAME="1049"></A>it state in which he can refuse the lover anything, if he ask him; although 
<A NAME="1050"></A>his fellow-steed and the charioteer oppose him with the arguments of shame 
<A NAME="1051"></A>and reason.
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR><BR>After this their happiness depends upon their self-control; if 
<A NAME="1053"></A>the better elements of the mind which lead to order and philosophy prevail, 
<A NAME="1054"></A>then they pass their life here in happiness and harmony-masters of themselves 
<A NAME="1055"></A>and orderly-enslaving the vicious and emancipating the virtuous elements 
<A NAME="1056"></A>of the soul; and when the end comes, they are light and winged for flight, 
<A NAME="1057"></A>having conquered in one of the three heavenly or truly Olympian victories; 
<A NAME="1058"></A>nor can human discipline or divine inspiration confer any greater blessing 
<A NAME="1059"></A>on man than this. If, on the other hand, they leave philosophy and lead 
<A NAME="1060"></A>the lower life of ambition, then probably, after wine or in some other 
<A NAME="1061"></A>careless hour, the two wanton animals take the two souls when off their 
<A NAME="1062"></A>guard and bring them together, and they accomplish that desire of their 
<A NAME="1063"></A>hearts which to the many is bliss; and this having once enjoyed they continue 
<A NAME="1064"></A>to enjoy, yet rarely because they have not the approval of the whole soul. 
<A NAME="1065"></A>They too are dear, but not so dear to one another as the others, either 
<A NAME="1066"></A>at the time of their love or afterwards. They consider that they have given 
<A NAME="1067"></A>and taken from each other the most sacred pledges, and they may not break 
<A NAME="1068"></A>them and fall into enmity. At last they pass out of the body, unwinged, 
<A NAME="1069"></A>but eager to soar, and thus obtain no mean reward of love and madness. 
<A NAME="1070"></A>For those who have once begun the heavenward pilgrimage may not go down 
<A NAME="1071"></A>again to darkness and the journey beneath the earth, but they live in light 
<A NAME="1072"></A>always; happy companions in their pilgrimage, and when the time comes at 
<A NAME="1073"></A>which they receive their wings they have the same plumage because of their 
<A NAME="1074"></A>love.
<A NAME="1075"></A><BR><BR>Thus great are the heavenly blessings which the friendship of a 
<A NAME="1076"></A>lover will confer upon you, my youth. Whereas the attachment of the non-lover, 
<A NAME="1077"></A>which is alloyed with a worldly prudence and has worldly and niggardly 
<A NAME="1078"></A>ways of doling out benefits, will breed in your soul those vulgar qualities 
<A NAME="1079"></A>which the populace applaud, will send you bowling round the earth during 
<A NAME="1080"></A>a period of nine thousand years, and leave, you a fool in the world 
<A NAME="1081"></A>below.
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR><BR>And thus, dear Eros, I have made and paid my recantation, as well 
<A NAME="1083"></A>and as fairly as I could; more especially in the matter of the poetical 
<A NAME="1084"></A>figures which I was compelled to use, because Phaedrus would have them. 
<A NAME="1085"></A>And now forgive the past and accept the present, and be gracious and merciful 
<A NAME="1086"></A>to me, and do not in thine anger deprive me of sight, or take from me the 
<A NAME="1087"></A>art of love which thou hast given me, but grant that I may be yet more 
<A NAME="1088"></A>esteemed in the eyes of the fair. And if Phaedrus or I myself said anything 
<A NAME="1089"></A>rude in our first speeches, blame Lysias, who is the father of the brat, 
<A NAME="1090"></A>and let us have no more of his progeny; bid him study philosophy, like 
<A NAME="1091"></A>his brother Polemarchus; and then his lover Phaedrus will no longer halt 
<A NAME="1092"></A>between two opinions, but will dedicate himself wholly to love and to philosophical 
<A NAME="1093"></A>discourses.
<A NAME="1094"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> I join in the prayer, Socrates, and say with you, 
<A NAME="1095"></A>if this be for my good, may your words come to pass. But why did you make 
<A NAME="1096"></A>your second oration so much finer than the first? I wonder why. And I begin 
<A NAME="1097"></A>to be afraid that I shall lose conceit of Lysias, and that he will appear 
<A NAME="1098"></A>tame in comparison, even if he be willing to put another as fine and as 
<A NAME="1099"></A>long as yours into the field, which I doubt. For quite lately one of your 
<A NAME="1100"></A>politicians was abusing him on this very account; and called him a "speech 
<A NAME="1101"></A>writer" again and again. So that a feeling of pride may probably induce 
<A NAME="1102"></A>him to give up writing speeches.
<A NAME="1103"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> What a very amusing notion! But I think, my young man, 
<A NAME="1104"></A>that you are much mistaken in your friend if you imagine that he is frightened 
<A NAME="1105"></A>at a little noise; and possibly, you think that his assailant was in 
<A NAME="1106"></A>earnest?
<A NAME="1107"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> I thought, Socrates, that he was. And you are aware 
<A NAME="1108"></A>that the greatest and most influential statesmen are ashamed of writing 
<A NAME="1109"></A>speeches and leaving them in a written form, lest they should be called 
<A NAME="1110"></A>Sophists by posterity.
<A NAME="1111"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> You seem to be unconscious, Phaedrus, that the "sweet 
<A NAME="1112"></A>elbow" of the proverb is really the long arm of the Nile. And you appear 
<A NAME="1113"></A>to be equally unaware of the fact that this sweet elbow of theirs is also 
<A NAME="1114"></A>a long arm. For there is nothing of which our great politicians are so 
<A NAME="1115"></A>fond as of writing speeches and bequeathing them to posterity. And they 
<A NAME="1116"></A>add their admirers' names at the top of the writing, out of gratitude to 
<A NAME="1117"></A>them.
<A NAME="1118"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> What do you mean? I do not understand.
<A NAME="1119"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Why, do you not know that when a politician writes, 
<A NAME="1120"></A>he begins with the names of his approvers?
<A NAME="1121"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedr.</B> How so?
<A NAME="1122"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Why, he begins in this manner: "Be it enacted by the 
<A NAME="1123"></A>senate, the people, or both, on the motion of a certain person," who is 
<A NAME="1124"></A>our author; and so putting on a serious face, he proceeds to display his 
<A NAME="1125"></A>own wisdom to his admirers in what is often a long and tedious composition. 
<A NAME="1126"></A>Now what is that sort of thing but a regular piece of 
<A NAME="1127"></A>authorship?
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> True. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> And if the law is finally approved, then the author leaves the
theatre in high delight; but if the law is rejected and he is done
out of his speech-making, and not thought good enough to write, then
he and his party are in mourning. 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Very true. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> So far are they from despising, or rather so highly do they value
the practice of writing. 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> No doubt. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> And when the king or orator has the power, as Lycurgus or Solon
or Darius had, of attaining an immortality or authorship in a state,
is he not thought by posterity, when they see his compositions, and
does he not think himself, while he is yet alive, to be a god?
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Very true. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Then do you think that any one of this class, however ill-disposed,
would reproach Lysias with being an author? 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Not upon your view; for according to you he would be casting
a slur upon his own favourite pursuit. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Any one may see that there is no disgrace in the mere fact of
writing. 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Certainly not. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> The disgrace begins when a man writes not well, but badly.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Clearly. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> And what is well and what is badly-need we ask Lysias, or any
other poet or orator, who ever wrote or will write either a political
or any other work, in metre or out of metre, poet or prose writer,
to teach us this? 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Need we? For what should a man live if not for the pleasures
of discourse? Surely not for the sake of bodily pleasures, which almost
always have previous pain as a condition of them, and therefore are
rightly called slavish. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> There is time enough. And I believe that the grasshoppers 
chirruping
after their manner in the heat of the sun over our heads are talking
to one another and looking down at us. What would they say if they
saw that we, like the many, are not conversing, but slumbering at
mid-day, lulled by their voices, too indolent to think? Would they
not have a right to laugh at us? They might imagine that we were slaves,
who, coming to rest at a place of resort of theirs, like sheep lie
asleep at noon around the well. But if they see us discoursing, and
like Odysseus sailing past them, deaf to their siren voices, they
may perhaps, out of respect, give us of the gifts which they receive
from the gods that they may impart them to men. 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> What gifts do you mean? I never heard of any. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> A lover of music like yourself ought surely to have heard the
story of the grasshoppers, who are said to have been human beings
in an age before the Muses. And when the Muses came and song appeared
they were ravished with delight; and singing always, never thought
of eating and drinking, until at last in their forgetfulness they
died. And now they live again in the grasshoppers; and this is the
return which the Muses make to them-they neither hunger, nor thirst,
but from the hour of their birth are always singing, and never eating
or drinking; and when they die they go and inform the Muses in heaven
who honours them on earth. They win the love of Terpsichore for the
dancers by their report of them; of Erato for the lovers, and of the
other Muses for those who do them honour, according to the several
ways of honouring them of Calliope the eldest Muse and of Urania who
is next to her, for the philosophers, of whose music the grasshoppers
make report to them; for these are the Muses who are chiefly concerned
with heaven and thought, divine as well as human, and they have the
sweetest utterance. For many reasons, then, we ought always to talk
and not to sleep at mid-day. 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Let us talk. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Shall we discuss the rules of writing and speech as we were 
proposing?
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Very good. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> In good speaking should not the mind of the speaker know the
truth of the matter about which he is going to speak? 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> And yet, Socrates, I have heard that he who would be an orator
has nothing to do with true justice, but only with that which is likely
to be approved by the many who sit in judgment; nor with the truly
good or honourable, but only with opinion about them, and that from
opinion comes persuasion, and not from the truth. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> The words of the wise are not to be set aside; for there is 
probably
something in them; and therefore the meaning of this saying is not
hastily to be dismissed. 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Very true. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Let us put the matter thus:-Suppose that I persuaded you to buy
a horse and go to the wars. Neither of us knew what a horse was like,
but I knew that you believed a horse to be of tame animals the one
which has the longest ears. 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> That would be ridiculous. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> There is something more ridiculous coming:-Suppose, further,
that in sober earnest I, having persuaded you of this, went and composed
a speech in honour of an ass, whom I entitled a horse beginning: "A
noble animal and a most useful possession, especially in war, and
you may get on his back and fight, and he will carry baggage or 
anything."
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> How ridiculous! 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Ridiculous! Yes; but is not even a ridiculous friend better than
a cunning enemy? 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Certainly. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> And when the orator instead of putting an ass in the place of
a horse puts good for evil being himself as ignorant of their true
nature as the city on which he imposes is ignorant; and having studied
the notions of the multitude, falsely persuades them not about "the
shadow of an ass," which he confounds with a horse, but about good
which he confounds with evily-what will be the harvest which rhetoric
will be likely to gather after the sowing of that seed? 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> The reverse of good. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> But perhaps rhetoric has been getting too roughly handled by
us, and she might answer: What amazing nonsense you are talking! As
if I forced any man to learn to speak in ignorance of the truth! 
Whatever
my advice may be worth, I should have told him to arrive at the truth
first, and then come to me. At the same time I boldly assert that
mere knowledge of the truth will not give you the art of persuasion.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> There is reason in the lady's defence of herself.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Quite true; if only the other arguments which remain to be brought
up bear her witness that she is an art at all. But I seem to hear
them arraying themselves on the opposite side, declaring that she
speaks falsely, and that rhetoric is a mere routine and trick, not
an art. Lo! a Spartan appears, and says that there never is nor ever
will be a real art of speaking which is divorced from the truth.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> And what are these arguments, Socrates? Bring them out that
we may examine them. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Come out, fair children, and convince Phaedrus, who is the father
of similar beauties, that he will never be able to speak about anything
as he ought to speak unless he have a knowledge of philosophy. And
let Phaedrus answer you. 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Put the question. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Is not rhetoric, taken generally, a universal art of enchanting
the mind by arguments; which is practised not only in courts and public
assemblies, but in private houses also, having to do with all matters,
great as well as small, good and bad alike, and is in all equally
right, and equally to be esteemed-that is what you have heard?
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Nay, not exactly that; I should say rather that I have heard
the art confined to speaking and writing in lawsuits, and to speaking
in public assemblies-not extended farther. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Then I suppose that you have only heard of the rhetoric of Nestor
and Odysseus, which they composed in their leisure hours when at Troy,
and never of the rhetoric of Palamedes? 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> No more than of Nestor and Odysseus, unless Gorgias is your
Nestor, and Thrasymachus or Theodorus your Odysseus. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Perhaps that is my meaning. But let us leave them. And do you
tell me, instead, what are plaintiff and defendant doing in a law
court-are they not contending? 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Exactly so. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> About the just and unjust-that is the matter in dispute?
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Yes. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> And a professor of the art will make the same thing appear to
the same persons to be at one time just, at another time, if he is
so inclined, to be unjust? 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Exactly. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> And when he speaks in the assembly, he will make the same things
seem good to the city at one time, and at another time the reverse
of good? 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> That is true. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Have we not heard of the Eleatic Palamedes (Zeno), who has an
art of speaking by which he makes the same things appear to his hearers
like and unlike, one and many, at rest and in motion? 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Very true. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> The art of disputation, then, is not confined to the courts and
the assembly, but is one and the same in every use of language; this
is the art, if there be such an art, which is able to find a likeness
of everything to which a likeness can be found, and draws into the
light of day the likenesses and disguises which are used by others?
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> How do you mean? 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Let me put the matter thus: When will there be more chance of
deception-when the difference is large or small? 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> When the difference is small. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> And you will be less likely to be discovered in passing by degrees
into the other extreme than when you go all at once? 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Of course. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> He, then, who would. deceive others, and not be deceived, must
exactly know the real likenesses and differences of things?
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> He must. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> And if he is ignorant of the true nature of any subject, how
can he detect the greater or less degree of likeness in other things
to that of which by the hypothesis he is ignorant? 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> He cannot. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> And when men are deceived and their notions are at variance with
realities, it is clear that the error slips in through resemblances?
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Yes, that is the way. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Then he who would be a master of the art must understand the
real nature of everything; or he will never know either how to make
the gradual departure from truth into the opposite of truth which
is effected by the help of resemblances, or how to avoid it?
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> He will not. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> He then, who being ignorant of the truth aims at appearances,
will only attain an art of rhetoric which is ridiculous and is not
an art at all? 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> That may be expected. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Shall I propose that we look for examples of art and want of
art, according to our notion of them, in the speech of Lysias which
you have in your hand, and in my own speech? 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Nothing could be better; and indeed I think that our previous
argument has been too abstract and-wanting in illustrations.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Yes; and the two speeches happen to afford a very good example
of the way in which the speaker who knows the truth may, without any
serious purpose, steal away the hearts of his hearers. This piece
of good-fortune I attribute to the local deities; and perhaps, the
prophets of the Muses who are singing over our heads may have imparted
their inspiration to me. For I do not imagine that I have any rhetorical
art of my own. 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Granted; if you will only please to get on. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Suppose that you read me the first words of Lysias' speech.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> "You know how matters stand with me, and how, as I conceive,
they might be arranged for our common interest; and I maintain that
I ought not to fail in my suit, because I am not your lover. For lovers
repent-" 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Enough:-Now, shall I point out the rhetorical error of those
words? 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Yes. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Every one is aware that about some things we are agreed, whereas
about other things we differ. 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> I think that I understand you; but will you explain yourself?
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> When any one speaks of iron and silver, is not the same thing
present in the minds of all? 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Certainly. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> But when any one speaks of justice and goodness we part company
and are at odds with one another and with ourselves? 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Precisely. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Then in some things we agree, but not in others? 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> That is true. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> In which are we more likely to be deceived, and in which has
rhetoric the greater power? 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Clearly, in the uncertain class. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Then the rhetorician ought to make a regular division, and acquire
a distinct notion of both classes, as well of that in which the many
err, as of that in which they do not err? 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> He who made such a distinction would have an excellent 
principle.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Yes; and in the next place he must have a keen eye for the 
observation
of particulars in speaking, and not make a mistake about the class
to which they are to be referred. 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Certainly. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Now to which class does love belong-to the debatable or to the
undisputed class? 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> To the debatable, clearly; for if not, do you think that love
would have allowed you to say as you did, that he is an evil both
to the lover and the beloved, and also the greatest possible good?
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Capital. But will you tell me whether I defined love at the 
beginning
of my speech? for, having been in an ecstasy, I cannot well remember.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Yes, indeed; that you did, and no mistake. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Then I perceive that the Nymphs of Achelous and Pan the son of
Hermes, who inspired me, were far better rhetoricians than Lysias
the son of Cephalus. Alas! how inferior to them he is! But perhaps
I am mistaken; and Lysias at the commencement of his lover's speech
did insist on our supposing love to be something or other which he
fancied him to be, and according to this model he fashioned and framed
the remainder of his discourse. Suppose we read his beginning over
again: 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> If you please; but you will not find what you want.
<br><br>
Soc, Read, that I may have his exact words. 
<b>Phaedr.</b> "You know how matters stand with and how, as I conceive, they
might be arranged for our common interest; and I maintain I ought
not to fail in my suit because I am not your lover, for lovers repent
of the kindnesses which they have shown, when their love is over."
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Here he appears to have done just the reverse of what he ought;
for he has begun at the end, and is swimming on his back through the
flood to the place of starting. His address to the fair youth begins
where the lover would have ended. Am I not right, sweet Phaedrus?
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Yes, indeed, Socrates; he does begin at the end.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Then as to the other topics-are they not thrown down anyhow?
Is there any principle in them? Why should the next topic follow next
in order, or any other topic? I cannot help fancying in my ignorance
that he wrote off boldly just what came into his head, but I dare
say that you would recognize a rhetorical necessity in the succession
of the several parts of the composition? 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> You have too good an opinion of me if you think that I have
any such insight into his principles of composition. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> At any rate, you will allow that every discourse ought to be
a living creature, having a body of its own and a head and feet; there
should be a middle, beginning, and end, adapted to one another and
to the whole? 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Certainly. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Can this be said of the discourse of Lysias? See whether you
can find any more connexion in his words than in the epitaph which
is said by some to have been inscribed on the grave of Midas the 
Phrygian.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> What is there remarkable in the epitaph? 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> It is as follows:- 
<br><br>
I am a maiden of bronze and lie on the tomb of Midas; 
So long as water flows and tall trees grow, 
So long here on this spot by his sad tomb abiding, 
I shall declare to passers-by that Midas sleeps below. Now in this
rhyme whether a line comes first or comes last, as you will perceive,
makes no difference. 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> You are making fun of that oration of ours. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Well, I will say no more about your friend's speech lest I should
give offence to you; although I think that it might furnish many other
examples of what a man ought rather to avoid. But I will proceed to
the other speech, which, as I think, is also suggestive to students
of rhetoric. 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> In what way? 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> The two speeches, as you may remember, were unlike-I the one
argued that the lover and the other that the non-lover ought to be
accepted. 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> And right manfully. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> You should rather say "madly"; and madness was the argument of
them, for, as I said, "love is a madness." 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Yes. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> And of madness there were two kinds; one produced by human 
infirmity,
the other was a divine release of the soul from the yoke of custom
nd convention. 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> True. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> The divine madness was subdivided into four kinds, prophetic,
initiatory, poetic, erotic, having four gods presiding over them;
the first was the inspiration of Apollo, the second that of Dionysus,
the third that of the Muses, the fourth that of Aphrodite and Eros.
In the description of the last kind of madness, which was also said
to be the best, we spoke of the affection of love in a figure, into
which we introduced a tolerably credible and possibly true though
partly erring myth, which was also a hymn in honour of Love, who is
your lord and also mine, Phaedrus, and the guardian of fair children,
and to him we sung the hymn in measured and solemn strain.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> I know that I had great pleasure in listening to you.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Let us take this instance and note how the transition was made
from blame to praise. 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> What do you mean? 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> I mean to say that the composition was mostly playful. Yet in
these chance fancies of the hour were involved two principles of which
we should be too glad to have a clearer description if art could give
us one. 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> What are they? 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> First, the comprehension of scattered particulars in one idea;
as in our definition of love, which whether true or false certainly
gave clearness and consistency to the discourse, the speaker should
define his several notions and so make his meaning clear.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> What is the other principle, Socrates? 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> The second principle is that of division into species according
to the natural formation, where the joint is, not breaking any part
as a bad carver might. Just as our two discourses, alike assumed,
first of all, a single form of unreason; and then, as the body which
from being one becomes double and may be divided into a left side
and right side, each having parts right and left of the same name-after
this manner the speaker proceeded to divide the parts of the left
side and did not desist until he found in them an evil or left-handed
love which he justly reviled; and the other discourse leading us to
the madness which lay on the right side, found another love, also
having the same name, but divine, which the speaker held up before
us and applauded and affirmed to be the author of the greatest benefits.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Most true. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> I am myself a great lover of these processes of division and
generalization; they help me to speak and to think. And if I find
any man who is able to see "a One and Many" in nature, him I follow,
and "walk in his footsteps as if he were a god." And those who have
this art, I have hitherto been in the habit of calling dialecticians;
but God knows whether the name is right or not. And I should like
to know what name you would give to your or to Lysias' disciples,
and whether this may not be that famous art of rhetoric which 
Thrasymachus
and others teach and practise? Skilful speakers they are, and impart
their skill to any who is willing to make kings of them and to bring
gifts to them. 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Yes, they are royal men; but their art is not the same with
the art of those whom you call, and rightly, in my opinion, 
dialecticians:-Still
we are in the dark about rhetoric. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> What do you mean? The remains of it, if there be anything remaining
which can be brought under rules of art, must be a fine thing; and,
at any rate, is not to be despised by you and me. But how much is
left? 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> There is a great deal surely to be found in books of rhetoric?
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Yes; thank you for reminding me:-There is the exordium, showing
how the speech should begin, if I remember rightly; that is what you
mean-the niceties of the art? 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Yes. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Then follows the statement of facts, and upon that witnesses;
thirdly, proofs; fourthly, probabilities are to come; the great 
Byzantian
word-maker also speaks, if I am not mistaken, of confirmation and
further confirmation. 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> You mean the excellent Theodorus. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Yes; and he tells how refutation or further refutation is to
be managed, whether in accusation or defence. I ought also to mention
the illustrious Parian, Evenus, who first invented insinuations and
indirect praises; and also indirect censures, which according to some
he put into verse to help the memory. But shall I "to dumb forgetfulness
consign" Tisias and Gorgias, who are not ignorant that probability
is superior to truth, and who by: force of argument make the little
appear great and the great little, disguise the new in old fashions
and the old in new fashions, and have discovered forms for everything,
either short or going on to infinity. I remember Prodicus laughing
when I told him of this; he said that he had himself discovered the
true rule of art, which was to be neither long nor short, but of a
convenient length. 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Well done, Prodicus! 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Then there is Hippias the Elean stranger, who probably agrees
with him. 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Yes. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> And there is also Polus, who has treasuries of diplasiology,
and gnomology, and eikonology, and who teaches in them the names of
which Licymnius made him a present; they were to give a polish.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Had not Protagoras something of the same sort? 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Yes, rules of correct diction and many other fine precepts; for
the "sorrows of a poor old man," or any other pathetic case, no one
is better than the Chalcedonian giant; he can put a whole company
of people into a passion and out of one again by his mighty magic,
and is first-rate at inventing or disposing of any sort of calumny
on any grounds or none. All of them agree in asserting that a speech
should end in a recapitulation, though they do not all agree to use
the same word. 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> You mean that there should be a summing up of the arguments
in order to remind the hearers of them. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> I have now said all that I have to say of the art of rhetoric:
have you anything to add? 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Not much; nothing very important. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Leave the unimportant and let us bring the really important 
question
into the light of day, which is: What power has this art of rhetoric,
and when? 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> A very great power in public meetings. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> It has. But I should like to know whether you have the same feeling
as I have about the rhetoricians? To me there seem to be a great many
holes in their web. 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Give an example. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> I will. Suppose a person to come to your friend Eryximachus,
or to his father Acumenus, and to say to him: "I know how to apply
drugs which shall have either a heating or a cooling effect, and I
can give a vomit and also a purge, and all that sort of thing; and
knowing all this, as I do, I claim to be a physician and to make 
physicians
by imparting this knowledge to others,"-what do you suppose that they
would say? 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> They would be sure to ask him whether he knew "to whom" he
would give his medicines, and "when," and "how much." 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> And suppose that he were to reply: "No; I know nothing of all
that; I expect the patient who consults me to be able to do these
things for himself"? 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> They would say in reply that he is a madman or pedant who
fancies that he is a physician because he has read something in a
book, or has stumbled on a prescription or two, although he has no
real understanding of the art of medicine. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> And suppose a person were to come to Sophocles or Euripides and
say that he knows how to make a very long speech about a small matter,
and a short speech about a great matter, and also a sorrowful speech,
or a terrible, or threatening speech, or any other kind of speech,
and in teaching this fancies that he is teaching the art of tragedy-?
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> They too would surely laugh at him if he fancies that tragedy
is anything but the arranging of these elements in a manner which
will be suitable to one another and to the whole. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> But I do not suppose that they would be rude or abusive to him:
Would they not treat him as a musician would a man who thinks that
he is a harmonist because he knows how to pitch the highest and lowest
notes; happening to meet such an one he would not say to him savagely,
"Fool, you are mad!" But like a musician, in a gentle and harmonious
tone of voice, he would answer: "My good friend, he who would be a
harmonist must certainly know this, and yet he may understand nothing
of harmony if he has not got beyond your stage of knowledge, for you
only know the preliminaries of harmony and not harmony itself."
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Very true. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> And will not Sophocles say to the display of the would-be 
tragedian,
that this is not tragedy but the preliminaries of tragedy? and will
not Acumenus say the same of medicine to the would-be physician?
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Quite true. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> And if Adrastus the mellifluous or Pericles heard of these 
wonderful
arts, brachylogies and eikonologies and all the hard names which we
have been endeavouring to draw into the light of day, what would they
say? Instead of losing temper and applying uncomplimentary epithets,
as you and I have been doing, to the authors of such an imaginary
art, their superior wisdom would rather censure us, as well as them.
"Have a little patience, Phaedrus and Socrates, they would say; you
should not be in such a passion with those who from some want of 
dialectical
skill are unable to define the nature of rhetoric, and consequently
suppose that they have found the art in the preliminary conditions
of it, and when these have been taught by them to others, fancy that
the whole art of rhetoric has been taught by them; but as to using
the several instruments of the art effectively, or making the 
composition
a whole,-an application of it such as this is they regard as an easy
thing which their disciples may make for themselves." 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> I quite admit, Socrates, that the art of rhetoric which these
men teach and of which they write is such as you describe-there I
agree with you. But I still want to know where and how the true art
of rhetoric and persuasion is to be acquired. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> The perfection which is required of the finished orator is, or
rather must be, like the perfection of anything else; partly given
by nature, but may also be assisted by art. If you have the natural
power and add to it knowledge and practice, you will be a distinguished
speaker; if you fall short in either of these, you will be to that
extent defective. But the art, as far as there is an art, of rhetoric
does not lie in the direction of Lysias or Thrasymachus.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> In what direction then? 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> I conceive Pericles to have been the most accomplished of 
rhetoricians.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> What of that? 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> All the great arts require discussion and high speculation about
the truths of nature; hence come loftiness of thought and completeness
of execution. And this, as I conceive, was the quality which, in 
addition
to his natural gifts, Pericles acquired from his intercourse with
Anaxagoras whom he happened to know. He was thus imbued with the higher
philosophy, and attained the knowledge of Mind and the negative of
Mind, which were favourite themes of Anaxagoras, and applied what
suited his purpose to the art of speaking. 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Explain. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Rhetoric is like medicine. 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> How so? 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Why, because medicine has to define the nature of the body and
rhetoric of the soul-if we would proceed, not empirically but 
scientifically,
in the one case to impart health and strength by giving medicine and
food in the other to implant the conviction or virtue which you desire,
by the right application of words and training. 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> There, Socrates, I suspect that you are right. 
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> And do you think that you can know the nature of the soul 
intelligently
without knowing the nature of the whole? 
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Hippocrates the Asclepiad says that the nature even of the body 
can only be understood as a whole.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Yes, friend, and he was right:-still, we ought not to be content 
with the name of Hippocrates, but to examine and see whether his 
argument agrees with his conception of nature.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> I agree.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Then consider what truth as well as Hippocrates says about this or 
about any other nature. Ought we not to consider first whether that 
which we wish to learn and to teach is a simple or multiform thing, and 
if simple, then to enquire what power it has of acting or being acted 
upon in relation to other things, and if multiform, then to number the 
forms; and see first in the case of one of them, and then in. case of 
all of them, what is that power of acting or being acted upon which 
makes each and all of them to be what they are?
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> You may very likely be right, Socrates.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> The method which proceeds without analysis is like the groping of 
a blind man. Yet, surely, he who is an artist ought not to admit of a 
comparison with the blind, or deaf. The rhetorician, who teaches his 
pupil to speak scientifically, will particularly set forth the nature 
of that being to which he addresses his speeches; and this, I conceive, 
to be the soul.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Certainly.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> His whole effort is directed to the soul; for in that he seeks to 
produce conviction.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Yes.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Then clearly, Thrasymachus or any one else who teaches rhetoric in 
earnest will give an exact description of the nature of the soul; which 
will enable us to see whether she be single and same, or, like the 
body, multiform. That is what we should call showing the nature of the 
soul.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Exactly.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> He will explain, secondly, the mode in which she acts or is acted 
upon.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> True.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Thirdly, having classified men and speeches, and their kinds and 
affections, and adapted them to one another, he will tell the reasons 
of his arrangement, and show why one soul is persuaded by a particular 
form of argument, and another not.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> You have hit upon a very good way.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Yes, that is the true and only way in which any subject can be set 
forth or treated by rules of art, whether in speaking or writing. But 
the writers of the present day, at whose feet you have sat, craftily, 
conceal the nature of the soul which they know quite well. Nor, until 
they adopt our method of reading and writing, can we admit that they 
write by rules of art?
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> What is our method?
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> I cannot give you the exact details; but I should like to tell you 
generally, as far as is in my power, how a man ought to proceed 
according to rules of art.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Let me hear.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Oratory is the art of enchanting the soul, and therefore he who 
would be an orator has to learn the differences of human souls-they are 
so many and of such a nature, and from them come the differences 
between man and man. Having proceeded thus far in his analysis, he will 
next divide speeches into their different classes:-"Such and such 
persons," he will say, are affected by this or that kind of speech in 
this or that way," and he will tell you why. The pupil must have a good 
theoretical notion of them first, and then he must have experience of 
them in actual life, and be able to follow them with all his senses 
about him, or he will never get beyond the precepts of his masters. But 
when he understands what persons are persuaded by what arguments, and 
sees the person about whom he was speaking in the abstract actually 
before him, and knows that it is he, and can say to himself, "This is 
the man or this is the character who ought to have a certain argument 
applied to him in order to convince him of a certain opinion"; -he who 
knows all this, and knows also when he should speak and when he should 
refrain, and when he should use pithy sayings, pathetic appeals, 
sensational effects, and all the other modes of speech which he has 
learned;-when, I say, he knows the times and seasons of all these 
things, then, and not till then, he is a perfect master of his art; but 
if he fail in any of these points, whether in speaking or teaching or 
writing them, and yet declares that he speaks by rules of art, he who 
says "I don't believe you" has the better of him. Well, the teacher 
will say, is this, and Socrates, your account of the so-called art of 
rhetoric, or am I to look for another?
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> He must take this, Socrates for there is no possibility of 
another, and yet the creation of such an art is not easy.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Very true; and therefore let us consider this matter in every 
light, and see whether we cannot find a shorter and easier road; there 
is no use in taking a long rough round-about way if there be a shorter 
and easier one. And I wish that you would try and remember whether you 
have heard from Lysias or any one else anything which might be of 
service to us.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> If trying would avail, then I might; but at the moment I can 
think of nothing.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Suppose I tell you something which somebody who knows told me.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Certainly.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> May not "the wolf," as the proverb says, claim a hearing"?
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Do you say what can be said for him.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> He will argue that is no use in putting a solemn face on these 
matters, or in going round and round, until you arrive at first 
principles; for, as I said at first, when the question is of justice 
and good, or is a question in which men are concerned who are just and 
good, either by nature or habit, he who would be a skilful rhetorician 
has; no need of truth-for that in courts of law men literally care 
nothing about truth, but only about conviction: and this is based on 
probability, to which who would be a skilful orator should therefore 
give his whole attention. And they say also that there are cases in 
which the actual facts, if they are improbable, ought to be withheld, 
and only the probabilities should be told either in accusation or 
defence, and that always in speaking, the orator should keep 
probability in view, and say good-bye to the truth. And the observance, 
of this principle throughout a speech furnishes the whole art.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> That is what the professors of rhetoric do actually say, 
Socrates. I have not forgotten that we have quite briefly touched upon 
this matter already; with them the point is all-important.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> I dare say that you are familiar with Tisias. Does he not define 
probability to be that which the many think?
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Certainly, he does.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> I believe that he has a clever and ingenious case of this sort:-He 
supposes a feeble and valiant man to have assaulted a strong and 
cowardly one, and to have robbed him of his coat or of something or 
other; he is brought into court, and then Tisias says that both parties 
should tell lies: the coward should say that he was assaulted by more 
men than one; the other should prove that they were alone, and should 
argue thus: "How could a weak man like me have assaulted a strong man 
like him?" The complainant will not like to confess his own cowardice, 
and will therefore invent some other lie which his adversary will thus 
gain an opportunity of refuting. And there are other devices of the 
same kind which have a place in the system. Am I not right, Phaedrus?
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Certainly.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Bless me, what a wonderfully mysterious art is this which Tisias 
or some other gentleman, in whatever name or country he rejoices, has 
discovered. Shall we say a word to him or not?
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> What shall we say to him?
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Let us tell him that, before he appeared, you and I were saying 
that the probability of which he speaks was engendered in the minds of 
the many by the likeness of the truth, and we had just been affirming 
that he who knew the truth would always know best how to discover the 
resemblances of the truth. If he has anything else to say about the art 
of speaking we should like to hear him; but if not, we are satisfied 
with our own view, that unless a man estimates the various characters 
of his heaters and is able to divide all things into classes and to 
comprehend them under single ideas he will never be a skilful 
rhetorician even within the limits of human power. And this skill he 
will not attain without a great deal of trouble, which a good man ought 
to undergo, not for the sake of speaking and acting before men, but in 
order that he may be able to say what is acceptable to God and always 
to act acceptably to Him as far as in him lies; for there is a saying 
of wiser men than ourselves, that a man of sense should not try to 
please his fellow-servants (at least this should not be his first 
object) but his good and noble masters; and therefore if the way is 
long and circuitous, marvel not at this, for, where the end is great, 
there we may take the longer road, but not for lesser ends such as 
yours. Truly, the argument may say, Tisias, that if you do not mind 
going so far, rhetoric has a fair beginning here.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> I think, Socrates, that this is admirable, if only practicable.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> But even to fail in an honourable object is honourable.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> True.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Enough appears to have been said by us of a true and false art of 
speaking.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Certainly.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> But there is something yet to be said of propriety and impropriety 
of writing.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Yes.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Do you know how you can speak or act about rhetoric in a manner 
which will be acceptable to God?
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> No, indeed. Do you?
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> I have heard a tradition of the ancients, whether true or not they 
only know; although if we had found the truth ourselves, do you think 
that we should care much about the opinions of men?
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Your question needs no answer; but I wish that you would tell 
me what you say that you have heard.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> At the Egyptian city of Naucratis, there was a famous old god, 
whose name was Theuth; the bird which is called the Ibis is sacred to 
him, and he was the inventor of many arts, such as arithmetic and 
calculation and geometry and astronomy and draughts and dice, but his 
great discovery was the use of letters. Now in those days the god 
Thamus was the king of the whole country of Egypt; and he dwelt in that 
great city of Upper Egypt which the Hellenes call Egyptian Thebes, and 
the god himself is called by them Ammon. To him came Theuth and showed 
his inventions, desiring that the other Egyptians might be allowed to 
have the benefit of them; he enumerated them, and Thamus enquired about 
their several uses, and praised some of them and censured others, as he 
approved or disapproved of them. It would take a long time to repeat 
all that Thamus said to Theuth in praise or blame of the various arts. 
But when they came to letters, This, said Theuth, will make the 
Egyptians wiser and give them better memories; it is a specific both 
for the memory and for the wit. Thamus replied: O most ingenious 
Theuth, the parent or inventor of an art is not always the best judge 
of the utility or inutility of his own inventions to the users of them. 
And in this instance, you who are the father of letters, from a 
paternal love of your own children have been led to attribute to them a 
quality which they cannot have; for this discovery of yours will create 
forgetfulness in the learners' souls, because they will not use their 
memories; they will trust to the external written characters and not 
remember of themselves. The specific which you have discovered is an 
aid not to memory, but to reminiscence, and you give your disciples not 
truth, but only the semblance of truth; they will be hearers of many 
things and will have learned nothing; they will appear to be omniscient 
and will generally know nothing; they will be tiresome company, having 
the show of wisdom without the reality.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Yes, Socrates, you can easily invent tales of Egypt, or of any 
other country.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> There was a tradition in the temple of Dodona that oaks first gave 
prophetic utterances. The men of old, unlike in their simplicity to 
young philosophy, deemed that if they heard the truth even from "oak or 
rock," it was enough for them; whereas you seem to consider not whether 
a thing is or is not true, but who the speaker is and from what country 
the tale comes.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> I acknowledge the justice of your rebuke; and I think that the 
Theban is right in his view about letters.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> He would be a very simple person, and quite a stranger to the 
oracles of Thamus or Ammon, who should leave in writing or receive in 
writing any art under the idea that the written word would be 
intelligible or certain; or who deemed that writing was at all better 
than knowledge and recollection of the same matters?
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> That is most true.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> I cannot help feeling, Phaedrus, that writing is unfortunately 
like painting; for the creations of the painter have the attitude of 
life, and yet if you ask them a question they preserve a solemn 
silence. And the same may be said of speeches. You would imagine that 
they had intelligence, but if you want to know anything and put a 
question to one of them, the speaker always gives one unvarying answer. 
And when they have been once written down they are tumbled about 
anywhere among those who may or may not understand them, and know not 
to whom they should reply, to whom not: and, if they are maltreated or 
abused, they have no parent to protect them; and they cannot protect or 
defend themselves.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> That again is most true.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Is there not another kind of word or speech far better than this, 
and having far greater power-a son of the same family, but lawfully 
begotten?
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Whom do you mean, and what is his origin?
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> I mean an intelligent word graven in the soul of the learner, 
which can defend itself, and knows when to speak and when to be silent.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> You mean the living word of knowledge which has a soul, and of 
which written word is properly no more than an image?
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Yes, of course that is what I mean. And now may I be allowed to 
ask you a question: Would a husbandman, who is a man of sense, take the 
seeds, which he values and which he wishes to bear fruit, and in sober 
seriousness plant them during the heat of summer, in some garden of 
Adonis, that he may rejoice when he sees them in eight days appearing 
in beauty? at least he would do so, if at all, only for the sake of 
amusement and pastime. But when he is in earnest he sows in fitting 
soil, and practises husbandry, and is satisfied if in eight months the 
seeds which he has sown arrive at perfection?
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Yes, Socrates, that will be his way when he is in earnest; he 
will do the other, as you say, only in play.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> And can we suppose that he who knows the just and good and 
honourable has less understanding, than the husbandman, about his own 
seeds?
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Certainly not.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Then he will not seriously incline to "write" his thoughts "in 
water" with pen and ink, sowing words which can neither speak for 
themselves nor teach the truth adequately to others?
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> No, that is not likely.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> No, that is not likely-in the garden of letters he will sow and 
plant, but only for the sake of recreation and amusement; he will write 
them down as memorials to be treasured against the forgetfulness of old 
age, by himself, or by any other old man who is treading the same path. 
He will rejoice in beholding their tender growth; and while others are 
refreshing their souls with banqueting and the like, this will be the 
pastime in which his days are spent.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> A pastime, Socrates, as noble as the other is ignoble, the 
pastime of a man who can be amused by serious talk, and can discourse 
merrily about justice and the like.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> True, Phaedrus. But nobler far is the serious pursuit of the 
dialectician, who, finding a congenial soul, by the help of science 
sows and plants therein words which are able to help themselves and him 
who planted them, and are not unfruitful, but have in them a seed which 
others brought up in different soils render immortal, making the 
possessors of it happy to the utmost extent of human happiness.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Far nobler, certainly.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> And now, Phaedrus, having agreed upon the premises we decide about 
the conclusion.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> About what conclusion?
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> About Lysias, whom we censured, and his art of writing, and his 
discourses, and the rhetorical skill or want of skill which was shown 
in them-these are the questions which we sought to determine, and they 
brought us to this point. And I think that we are now pretty well 
informed about the nature of art and its opposite.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Yes, I think with you; but I wish that you would repeat what 
was said.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Until a man knows the truth of the several particulars of which he 
is writing or speaking, and is able to define them as they are, and 
having defined them again to divide them until they can be no longer 
divided, and until in like manner he is able to discern the nature of 
the soul, and discover the different modes of discourse which are 
adapted to different natures, and to arrange and dispose them in such a 
way that the simple form of speech may be addressed to the simpler 
nature, and the complex and composite to the more complex nature-until 
he has accomplished all this, he will be unable to handle arguments 
according to rules of art, as far as their nature allows them to be 
subjected to art, either for the purpose of teaching or 
persuading;-such is the view which is implied in the whole preceding 
argument.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Yes, that was our view, certainly.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Secondly, as to the censure which was passed on the speaking or 
writing of discourses, and how they might be rightly or wrongly 
censured-did not our previous argument show?-
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Show what?
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> That whether Lysias or any other writer that ever was or will be, 
whether private man or statesman, proposes laws and so becomes the 
author of a political treatise, fancying that there is any great 
certainty and clearness in his performance, the fact of his so writing 
is only a disgrace to him, whatever men may say. For not to know the 
nature of justice and injustice, and good and evil, and not to be able 
to distinguish the dream from the reality, cannot in truth be otherwise 
than disgraceful to him, even though he have the applause of the whole 
world.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Certainly.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> But he who thinks that in the written word there is necessarily 
much which is not serious, and that neither poetry nor prose, spoken or 
written, is of any great value, if, like the compositions of the 
rhapsodes, they are only recited in order to be believed, and not with 
any view to criticism or instruction; and who thinks that even the best 
of writings are but a reminiscence of what we know, and that only in 
principles of justice and goodness and nobility taught and communicated 
orally for the sake of instruction and graven in the soul, which is the 
true way of writing, is there clearness and perfection and seriousness, 
and that such principles are a man's own and his legitimate 
offspring;-being, in the first place, the word which he finds in his 
own bosom; secondly, the brethren and descendants and relations of his 
others;-and who cares for them and no others-this is the right sort of 
man; and you and I, Phaedrus, would pray that we may become like him.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> That is most assuredly my desire and prayer.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> And now the play is played out; and of rhetoric enough. Go and 
tell Lysias that to the fountain and school of the Nymphs we went down, 
and were bidden by them to convey a message to him and to other 
composers of speeches-to Homer and other writers of poems, whether set 
to music or not; and to Solon and others who have composed writings in 
the form of political discourses which they would term laws-to all of 
them we are to say that if their compositions are based on knowledge of 
the truth, and they can defend or prove them, when they are put to the 
test, by spoken arguments, which leave their writings poor in 
comparison of them, then they are to be called, not only poets, 
orators, legislators, but are worthy of a higher name, befitting the 
serious pursuit of their life.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> What name would you assign to them?
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Wise, I may not call them; for that is a great name which belongs 
to God alone,-lovers of wisdom or philosophers is their modest and 
befitting title.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Very suitable.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> And he who cannot rise above his own compilations and 
compositions, which he has been long patching, and piecing, adding some 
and taking away some, may be justly called poet or speech-maker or 
law-maker.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Certainly.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Now go and tell this to your companion.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> But there is also a friend of yours who ought not to be 
forgotten.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Who is he?
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Isocrates the fair:-What message will you send to him, and how 
shall we describe him?
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b>Isocrates is still young, Phaedrus; but I am willing to hazard a 
prophecy concerning him.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> What would you prophesy?
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> I think that he has a genius which soars above the orations of 
Lysias, and that his character is cast in a finer mould. My impression 
of him is that he will marvelously improve as he grows older, and that 
all former rhetoricians will be as children in comparison of him. And I 
believe that he will not be satisfied with rhetoric, but that there is 
in him a divine inspiration which will lead him to things higher still. 
For he has an element of philosophy in his nature. This is the message 
of the gods dwelling in this place, and which I will myself deliver to 
Isocrates, who is my delight; and do you give the other to Lysias, who 
is yours.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> I will; and now as the heat is abated let us depart.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Should we not offer up a prayer first of all to the local deities? 
By all means.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Beloved Pan, and all ye other gods who haunt this place, give me 
beauty in the inward soul; and may the outward and inward man be at 
one. May I reckon the wise to be the wealthy, and may I have such a 
quantity of gold as a temperate man and he only can bear and 
carry.-Anything more? The prayer, I think, is enough for me.
<br><br>
<b>Phaedr.</b> Ask the same for me, for friends should have all things in 
common.
<br><br>
<b>Soc.</b> Let us go.
