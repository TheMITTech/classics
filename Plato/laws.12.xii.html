<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>If a herald or an ambassador carry a false message from our city to any 
<A NAME="11"></A>other, or bring back a false message from the city to which he is sent, 
<A NAME="12"></A>or be proved to have brought back, whether from friends or enemies, in 
<A NAME="13"></A>his capacity of herald or ambassador, what they have never said, let him 
<A NAME="14"></A>be indicted for having violated, contrary to the law, the commands and 
<A NAME="15"></A>duties imposed upon him by Hermes and Zeus, and let there be a penalty 
<A NAME="16"></A>fixed, which he shall suffer or pay if he be convicted.
<A NAME="17"></A><BR><BR>Theft is a mean, and robbery a shameless thing; and none of the 
<A NAME="18"></A>sons of Zeus delight in fraud and violence, or ever practised, either. 
<A NAME="19"></A>Wherefore let no one be deluded by poets or mythologers into a mistaken 
<A NAME="20"></A>belief of such such things, nor let him suppose, when he thieves or is 
<A NAME="21"></A>guilty of violence, that he is doing nothing base, but only what the Gods 
<A NAME="22"></A>themselves do. For such tales are untrue and improbable; and he who steals 
<A NAME="23"></A>or robs contrary to the law, is never either a God or the son of a God; 
<A NAME="24"></A>of this the legislator ought to be better informed than all the, poets 
<A NAME="25"></A>put together. Happy is he and may he be forever happy, who is persuaded 
<A NAME="26"></A>and listens to our words; but he who disobeys shall have to contend against 
<A NAME="27"></A>the following law:-If a man steal anything belonging to the public, whether 
<A NAME="28"></A>that which he steals be much or little, he shall have the same punishment. 
<A NAME="29"></A>For he who steals a little steals with the same wish as he who steals much, 
<A NAME="30"></A>but with less power, and he who takes up a greater amount; not having deposited 
<A NAME="31"></A>it, is wholly unjust. Wherefore the law is not disposed to inflict a less 
<A NAME="32"></A>penalty on the one than on the other because his theft, is less, but on 
<A NAME="33"></A>the ground that the thief may possibly be in one case still curable, and 
<A NAME="34"></A>may in another case be incurable. If any one convict in a court of law 
<A NAME="35"></A>a stranger or a slave of a theft of public property, let the court determine 
<A NAME="36"></A>what punishment he shall suffer, or what penalty he shall pay, bearing 
<A NAME="37"></A>in mind that he is probably not incurable. But the citizen who has been 
<A NAME="38"></A>brought up as our citizens will have been, if he be found guilty of robbing 
<A NAME="39"></A>his country by fraud or violence, whether he be caught in the act or not, 
<A NAME="40"></A>shall be punished with death; for he is incurable.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR><BR>Now for expeditions of war much consideration and many laws are 
<A NAME="42"></A>required; the great principle of all is that no one of either sex should 
<A NAME="43"></A>be without a commander; nor should the mind of any one be accustomed to 
<A NAME="44"></A>do anything, either in jest or earnest, of his own motion, but in war and 
<A NAME="45"></A>in peace he should look to and follow his leader, even in the least things 
<A NAME="46"></A>being under his guidance; for example, he should stand or move, or exercise, 
<A NAME="47"></A>or wash, or take his meals, or get up in the night to keep guard and deliver 
<A NAME="48"></A>messages when he is bidden; and in the hour of danger he should not pursue 
<A NAME="49"></A>and not retreat except by order of his superior; and in a word, not teach 
<A NAME="50"></A>the soul or accustom her to know or understand how to do anything apart 
<A NAME="51"></A>from others. Of all soldiers the life should be always and in all things 
<A NAME="52"></A>as far as possible in common and together; there neither is nor ever will 
<A NAME="53"></A>be a higher, or better, or more scientific principle than this for the 
<A NAME="54"></A>attainment of salvation and victory in war. And we ought in time of peace 
<A NAME="55"></A>from youth upwards to practise this habit of commanding others, and of 
<A NAME="56"></A>being commanded by others; anarchy should have no place in the life of 
<A NAME="57"></A>man or of the beasts who are subject to man. I may add that all dances 
<A NAME="58"></A>ought to be performed with view to military excellence; and agility and 
<A NAME="59"></A>ease should be cultivated for the same object, and also endurance of the 
<A NAME="60"></A>want of meats and drinks, and of winter cold and summer heat, and of hard 
<A NAME="61"></A>couches; and, above all, care should be taken not to destroy the peculiar 
<A NAME="62"></A>qualities of the head and the feet by surrounding them with extraneous 
<A NAME="63"></A>coverings, and so hindering their natural growth of hair and soles. For 
<A NAME="64"></A>these are the extremities, and of all the parts of the body, whether they 
<A NAME="65"></A>are preserved or not is of the greatest consequence; the one is the servant 
<A NAME="66"></A>of the whole body, and the other the master, in whom all the ruling senses 
<A NAME="67"></A>are by nature set. Let the young man imagine that he hears in what has 
<A NAME="68"></A>preceded the praises of the military life; the law shall be as follows:-He 
<A NAME="69"></A>shall serve in war who is on the roll or appointed to some special service, 
<A NAME="70"></A>and if any one is absent from cowardice, and without the leave of the generals; 
<A NAME="71"></A>he shall be indicted before the military commanders for failure of service 
<A NAME="72"></A>when the army comes home; and the soldiers shall be his judges; the heavy 
<A NAME="73"></A>armed, and the cavalry, and the other arms of the service shall form separate 
<A NAME="74"></A>courts; and they shall bring the heavy-armed before the heavy-armed, and 
<A NAME="75"></A>the horsemen before the horsemen, and the others in like manner before 
<A NAME="76"></A>their peers; and he who is found guilty shall never be allowed to compete 
<A NAME="77"></A>for any prize of valour, or indict another for not serving on an expedition, 
<A NAME="78"></A>or be an accuser at all in any military matters. Moreover, the court shall 
<A NAME="79"></A>further determine what punishment he shall suffer, or what penalty he shall 
<A NAME="80"></A>pay. When the suits for failure of service are completed, the leaders of 
<A NAME="81"></A>the several kinds of troops shall again hold an assembly, and they shall 
<A NAME="82"></A>adjudge the prizes of valour; and he who likes shall give judgment in his 
<A NAME="83"></A>own branch of the service, saying nothing about any former expedition, 
<A NAME="84"></A>nor producing any proof or witnesses to confirm his statement, but speaking 
<A NAME="85"></A>only of the present occasion. The crown of victory shall be an olive wreath 
<A NAME="86"></A>which the victor shall offer up the temple of any war-god whom he likes, 
<A NAME="87"></A>adding an inscription for a testimony to last during life, that such an 
<A NAME="88"></A>one has received the first, the second, or prize. If any one goes on an 
<A NAME="89"></A>expedition, and returns home before the appointed time, when the generals. 
<A NAME="90"></A>have not withdrawn the army, be shall be indicted for desertion before 
<A NAME="91"></A>the same persons who took cognisance of failure of service, and if he be 
<A NAME="92"></A>found guilty, the same punishment shall be inflicted on 
<A NAME="93"></A>him.
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR>Now every man who is engaged in any suit ought to be very careful 
<A NAME="95"></A>of bringing false witness against any one, either intentionally or unintentionally, 
<A NAME="96"></A>if he can help; for justice is truly said to be an honourable maiden, and 
<A NAME="97"></A>falsehood is naturally repugnant to honour and justice. A witness ought 
<A NAME="98"></A>to be very careful not to sift against justice, as for example in what 
<A NAME="99"></A>relates to the throwing away of arms-he must distinguish the throwing them 
<A NAME="100"></A>away when necessary, and not make that a reproach, or bring in action against 
<A NAME="101"></A>some innocent person on that account. To make the distinction maybe difficult; 
<A NAME="102"></A>but still the law must attempt to define the different kinds in some way. 
<A NAME="103"></A>Let me endeavour to explain my meaning by an ancient tale:-If Patroclus 
<A NAME="104"></A>had been brought to the tent still alive but without his arms (and this 
<A NAME="105"></A>has happened to innumerable persons), the original arms, which the poet 
<A NAME="106"></A>says were presented to Peleus by the Gods as a nuptial gift when he married. 
<A NAME="107"></A>Thetis, remaining in the hands of Hector, then the base spirits of that 
<A NAME="108"></A>day might have reproached the son of Menoetius with having cast away his 
<A NAME="109"></A>arms. Again, there is the case of those who have been thrown down precipices 
<A NAME="110"></A>and lost their arms; and of those who at sea, and in stormy places, have 
<A NAME="111"></A>been suddenly overwhelmed by floods of water; and there are numberless 
<A NAME="112"></A>things of this kind which one might adduce by way of extenuation, and with 
<A NAME="113"></A>the view of justifying a misfortune which is easily misrepresented. We 
<A NAME="114"></A>must, therefore, endeavour to divide to the best of our power the greater 
<A NAME="115"></A>and more serious evil from the lesser. And a distinction may be drawn in 
<A NAME="116"></A>the use of terms of reproach. A man does not always deserve to be called 
<A NAME="117"></A>the thrower away of his shield; he may be only the loser of his arms. For 
<A NAME="118"></A>there is a great or rather absolute difference between him who is deprived 
<A NAME="119"></A>of his arms by a sufficient force, and him who voluntarily lets his shield 
<A NAME="120"></A>go. Let the law then be as follows:-If a person having arms is overtaken 
<A NAME="121"></A>by the enemy and does not turn round and defend himself, but lets them 
<A NAME="122"></A>go voluntarily or throws them away, choosing a base life and a swift escape 
<A NAME="123"></A>rather than a courageous and noble and blessed death-in such a case of 
<A NAME="124"></A>the throwing away of arms let justice be done, but the judge need take 
<A NAME="125"></A>no note of the case just now mentioned; for the bad man ought always to 
<A NAME="126"></A>be punished, in the hope that he may be improved, but not the unfortunate, 
<A NAME="127"></A>for there is no advantage in that. And what shall be the punishment suited 
<A NAME="128"></A>to him who has thrown away his weapons of defence? Tradition says that 
<A NAME="129"></A>Caeneus, the Thessalian, was changed by a God from a woman into a man; 
<A NAME="130"></A>but the converse miracle cannot now be wrought, or no punishment would 
<A NAME="131"></A>be more proper than that the man who throws away his shield should be changed 
<A NAME="132"></A>into a woman. This however is impossible, and therefore let us make a law 
<A NAME="133"></A>as nearly like this as we can-that he who loves his life too well shall 
<A NAME="134"></A>be in no danger for the remainder of his days, but shall live for ever 
<A NAME="135"></A>under the stigma of cowardice. And let the law be in the following terms:-When 
<A NAME="136"></A>a man is found guilty of disgracefully throwing away his arms in war, no 
<A NAME="137"></A>general or military officer shall allow him to serve as a soldier, or give 
<A NAME="138"></A>him any place at all in the ranks of soldiers; and the officer who gives 
<A NAME="139"></A>the coward any place, shall suffer a penalty which the public examiner 
<A NAME="140"></A>shall exact of him; and if he be of the highest dass, he shall pay a thousand 
<A NAME="141"></A>drachmae; or if he be of the second class, five minae; or if he be of the 
<A NAME="142"></A>third, three minae; or if he be of the fourth class, one mina. And he who 
<A NAME="143"></A>is found guilty of cowardice, shall not only be dismissed from manly dangers, 
<A NAME="144"></A>which is a disgrace appropriate to his nature, but he shall pay a thousand 
<A NAME="145"></A>drachmae, if he be of the highest class, and five minae if he be of the 
<A NAME="146"></A>second class, and three if he be of the third class, and a mina, like the 
<A NAME="147"></A>preceding, if he be of the fourth class.
<A NAME="148"></A><BR><BR>What regulations will be proper about examiners, seeing that some 
<A NAME="149"></A>of our magistrates are elected by lot, and for a year, and some for a longer 
<A NAME="150"></A>time and from selected persons? Of such magistrates, who will be a sufficient 
<A NAME="151"></A>censor or examiner, if any of them, weighed down by the pressure of office 
<A NAME="152"></A>or his own inability to support the dignity of his office, be guilty of 
<A NAME="153"></A>any crooked practice? It is by no means easy to find a magistrate who excels 
<A NAME="154"></A>other magistrates in virtue, but still we must endeavour to discover some 
<A NAME="155"></A>censor or examiner who is more than man. For the truth is, that there are 
<A NAME="156"></A>many elements of dissolution in a state, as there are also in a ship, or 
<A NAME="157"></A>in an animal; they all have their cords, and girders, and sinews-one nature 
<A NAME="158"></A>diffused in many places, and called by many names; and the office of examiner 
<A NAME="159"></A>is a most important element in the preservation and dissolution of states. 
<A NAME="160"></A>For if the examiners are better than the magistrates, and their duty is 
<A NAME="161"></A>fulfilled justly and without blame, then the whole state and country flourishes 
<A NAME="162"></A>and is happy; but if the examination of the magistrates is carried on in 
<A NAME="163"></A>a wrong way, then, by the relaxation of that justice which is the uniting 
<A NAME="164"></A>principle of all constitutions, every power in the state is rent asunder 
<A NAME="165"></A>from every other; they no longer incline in the same direction, but fill 
<A NAME="166"></A>the city with faction, and make many cities out of one, and soon bring 
<A NAME="167"></A>all to destruction. Wherefore the examiners ought to be admirable in every 
<A NAME="168"></A>sort of virtue. Let us invent a mode of creating them, which shall be as 
<A NAME="169"></A>follows:-Every year, after the summer solstice, the whole city shall meet 
<A NAME="170"></A>in the common precincts of Helios and Apollo, and shall present to the 
<A NAME="171"></A>God three men out of their own number in the manner following:-Each citizen 
<A NAME="172"></A>shall select, not himself, but some other citizen whom he deems in every 
<A NAME="173"></A>way the best, and who is not less than fifty years of age. And out of the 
<A NAME="174"></A>selected persons who have the greatest number of votes, they shall make 
<A NAME="175"></A>a further selection until they reduce them to one-half, if they are an 
<A NAME="176"></A>even number; but if they are not an even number, they shall subtract the 
<A NAME="177"></A>one who has the smallest number of votes, and make them an even number, 
<A NAME="178"></A>and then leave the half which have the great number of votes. And if two 
<A NAME="179"></A>persons have an equal number of votes, and thus increase the number beyond 
<A NAME="180"></A>one-half, they shall withdraw the younger of the two and do away with the 
<A NAME="181"></A>excess; and then including all the rest they shall again vote, until there 
<A NAME="182"></A>are left three having an unequal number of votes. But if all the three, 
<A NAME="183"></A>or two out of the three, have equal votes, let them commit the election 
<A NAME="184"></A>to good fate and fortune, and separate off by lot the first, and the second, 
<A NAME="185"></A>and the third; these they shall crown with an olive wreath and give them 
<A NAME="186"></A>the prize of excellence, at the same time proclaiming to all the world 
<A NAME="187"></A>that the city of the Magnetes, by providence of the Gods, is again preserved, 
<A NAME="188"></A>and presents to the Sun and to Apollo her three best men as first-fruits, 
<A NAME="189"></A>to be a common offering to them, according to the ancient law, as long 
<A NAME="190"></A>as their lives answer to the judgment formed of them. And these shall appoint 
<A NAME="191"></A>in their first year twelve examiners, to continue until each has completed 
<A NAME="192"></A>seventy-five years, to whom three shall afterwards be added yearly; and 
<A NAME="193"></A>let these divide all the magistracies into twelve parts, and prove the 
<A NAME="194"></A>holders of them by every sort of test to which a freeman may be subjected; 
<A NAME="195"></A>and let them live while they hold office in the precinct of Helios and 
<A NAME="196"></A>Apollo, in which they were chosen, and let each one form a judgment of 
<A NAME="197"></A>some things individually, and of others in company with his colleagues; 
<A NAME="198"></A>and let him place a writing in the agora about each magistracy, and what 
<A NAME="199"></A>the magistrate ought to suffer or pay, according to the decision of the 
<A NAME="200"></A>examiners. And if a magistrate does not admit that he has been justly judged, 
<A NAME="201"></A>let him bring the examiners before the select judges, and if he be acquitted 
<A NAME="202"></A>by their decision, let him, if he will, accuse the examiners themselves; 
<A NAME="203"></A>if, however, he be convicted, and have been condemned to death by the examiners, 
<A NAME="204"></A>let him die (and of course he can only die once):-but any other penalties 
<A NAME="205"></A>which admit of being doubled let him suffer twice over.
<A NAME="206"></A><BR><BR>And now let us pass under review the examiners themselves; what 
<A NAME="207"></A>will their examination be, and how conducted? During the life of these 
<A NAME="208"></A>men, whom the whole state counts worthy of the rewards of virtue, they 
<A NAME="209"></A>shall have the first seat at all public assemblies, and at all Hellenic 
<A NAME="210"></A>sacrifices and sacred missions, and other public and holy ceremonies in 
<A NAME="211"></A>which they share. The chiefs of each sacred mission shall be selected from 
<A NAME="212"></A>them, and they only of all the citizens shall be adorned with a crown of 
<A NAME="213"></A>laurel; they shall all be priests of Apollo and Helios; and one of them, 
<A NAME="214"></A>who is judged first of the priests created in that year, shall be high 
<A NAME="215"></A>priest; and they shall write up his name in each year to be a measure of 
<A NAME="216"></A>time as long as the city lasts; and after their death they shall be laid 
<A NAME="217"></A>out and carried to the grave and entombed in a manner different from the 
<A NAME="218"></A>other citizens. They shall be decked in a robe all of white, and there 
<A NAME="219"></A>shall be no crying or lamentation over them; but a chorus of fifteen maidens, 
<A NAME="220"></A>and another of boys, shall stand around the bier on either side, hymning 
<A NAME="221"></A>the praises of the departed priests in alternate responses, declaring their 
<A NAME="222"></A>blessedness in song all day long; and at dawn a hundred of the youths who 
<A NAME="223"></A>practise gymnastic and whom the relations of the departed shall choose, 
<A NAME="224"></A>shall carry the bier to the sepulchre, the young men marching first, dressed 
<A NAME="225"></A>in the garb of warriors-the cavalry with their horses, the heavy-armed 
<A NAME="226"></A>with their arms, and the others in like manner. And boys neat the bier 
<A NAME="227"></A>and in front of it shall sing their national hymn, and maidens shall follow 
<A NAME="228"></A>behind, and with them the women who have passed the age of childbearing; 
<A NAME="229"></A>next, although they are interdicted from other burials, let priests and 
<A NAME="230"></A>priestesses follow, unless the Pythian oracle forbid them; for this burial 
<A NAME="231"></A>is free from pollution. The place of burial shall be an oblong vaulted 
<A NAME="232"></A>chamber underground, constructed of tufa, which will last for ever, having 
<A NAME="233"></A>stone couches placed side by side. And here they will lay the blessed person, 
<A NAME="234"></A>and cover the sepulchre with a circular mound of earth and plant a grove 
<A NAME="235"></A>of trees around on every side but one; and on that side the sepulchre shall 
<A NAME="236"></A>be allowed to extend for ever, and a new mound will not be required. Every 
<A NAME="237"></A>year they shall have contests in music and gymnastics, and in horsemanship, 
<A NAME="238"></A>in honour of the dead. These are the honours which shall be given to those 
<A NAME="239"></A>who at the examination are found blameless; but if any of them, trusting 
<A NAME="240"></A>to the scrutiny being over, should, after the judgment has been given, 
<A NAME="241"></A>manifest the wickedness of human nature, let the law ordain that he who 
<A NAME="242"></A>pleases shall indict him, and let the cause be tried in the following manner. 
<A NAME="243"></A>In the first place, the court shall be composed of the guardians of the 
<A NAME="244"></A>law, and to them the surviving examiners shall be added, as well as the 
<A NAME="245"></A>court of select judges; and let the pursuer lay his indictment in this 
<A NAME="246"></A>form-he shall say that so-and-so is unworthy of the prize of virtue and 
<A NAME="247"></A>of his office; and if the defendant be convicted let him be deprived of 
<A NAME="248"></A>his office, and of the burial, and of the other honours given him. But 
<A NAME="249"></A>if the prosecutor do not obtain the fifth part of the votes, let him, if 
<A NAME="250"></A>he be of the first dass, pay twelve minae, and eight if he be of the second 
<A NAME="251"></A>class, and six if he be of the third dass, and two minae if he be of the 
<A NAME="252"></A>fourth class.
<A NAME="253"></A><BR><BR>The so-called decision of Rhadamanthus is worthy of all admiration. 
<A NAME="254"></A>He knew that the men of his own time believed and had no doubt that there 
<A NAME="255"></A>were Gods, which was a reasonable belief in those days, because most men 
<A NAME="256"></A>were the sons of Gods, and according to tradition he was one himself. He 
<A NAME="257"></A>appears to have thought that he ought to commit judgment to no man, but 
<A NAME="258"></A>to the Gods only, and in this way suits were simply and speedily decided 
<A NAME="259"></A>by him. For he made the two parties take an oath respecting the points 
<A NAME="260"></A>in dispute, and so got rid of the matter speedily and safely. But now that 
<A NAME="261"></A>a certain portion of mankind do not believe at all in the existence of 
<A NAME="262"></A>the Gods, and others imagine that they have no care of us, and the opinion 
<A NAME="263"></A>of most men, and of the men, is that in return for small sacrifice and 
<A NAME="264"></A>a few flattering words they will be their accomplices in purloining large 
<A NAME="265"></A>sums and save them from many terrible punishments, the way of Rhadamanthus 
<A NAME="266"></A>is no longer suited to the needs of justice; for as the needs of men about 
<A NAME="267"></A>the Gods are changed, the laws should also be changed;-in the granting 
<A NAME="268"></A>of suits a rational legislation ought to do away with the oaths of the 
<A NAME="269"></A>parties on either side-he who obtains leave to bring an action should write, 
<A NAME="270"></A>down the charges, but should not add an oath; and the defendant in like 
<A NAME="271"></A>manner should give his denial to the magistrates in writing, and not swear; 
<A NAME="272"></A>for it is a dreadful thing to know, when many lawsuits are going on in 
<A NAME="273"></A>a state that almost half the people who meet one another quite unconcernedly 
<A NAME="274"></A>at the public meals and in other companies and relations of private life 
<A NAME="275"></A>are perjured. Let the law, then, be as follows:-A judge who is about to 
<A NAME="276"></A>give judgment shall take an oath, and he who is choosing magistrates for 
<A NAME="277"></A>the state shall either vote on oath or with a voting tablet which he brings 
<A NAME="278"></A>from a temple; so too the judge of dances and of all music, and the superintendents 
<A NAME="279"></A>and umpires of gymnastic and equestrian contests, and any matters in which, 
<A NAME="280"></A>as far as men can judge, there is nothing to be gained by a false oath; 
<A NAME="281"></A>but all cases in which a denial confirmed by an oath clearly results in 
<A NAME="282"></A>a great advantage to the taker of the oath, shall be decided without the 
<A NAME="283"></A>oath of the parties to the suit, and the presiding judges shall not permit 
<A NAME="284"></A>either of them. to use an oath for the sake of persuading, nor to call 
<A NAME="285"></A>down curses on himself and his race, nor to use unseemly supplications 
<A NAME="286"></A>or womanish laments. But they shall ever be teaching and learning what 
<A NAME="287"></A>is just in auspicious words; and he who does otherwise shall be supposed 
<A NAME="288"></A>to speak beside the point, and the judges shall again bring him back to 
<A NAME="289"></A>the question at issue. On the other hand, strangers in their dealings with 
<A NAME="290"></A>strangers shall as at present have power to give and receive oaths, for 
<A NAME="291"></A>they will not often grow old in the city or leave a fry of young ones like 
<A NAME="292"></A>themselves to be the sons and heirs of the land.
<A NAME="293"></A><BR><BR>As to the initiation of private suits, let the manner of deciding 
<A NAME="294"></A>causes between all citizens be the same as in cases in which any freeman 
<A NAME="295"></A>is disobedient to the state in minor matters, of which the penalty is not 
<A NAME="296"></A>stripes, imprisonment, or death. But as regards attendance at choruses 
<A NAME="297"></A>or processions or other shows, and as regards public services, whether 
<A NAME="298"></A>the celebration of sacrifice in peace, or the payment of contributions 
<A NAME="299"></A>in war-in all these cases, first comes the necessity of providing remedy 
<A NAME="300"></A>for the loss; and by those who will not obey, there shall be security given 
<A NAME="301"></A>to the officers whom the city and the law empower to exact the sum due; 
<A NAME="302"></A>and if they forfeit their security, let the goods which they have pledged 
<A NAME="303"></A>be, and the money given to the city; but if they ought to pay a larger 
<A NAME="304"></A>sum, the several magistrates shall impose upon the disobedient a suitable 
<A NAME="305"></A>penalty, and bring them before the court, until they are willing to do 
<A NAME="306"></A>what they are ordered.
<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR>Now a state which makes money from the cultivation of the soil 
<A NAME="308"></A>only, and has no foreign trade, must consider what it will do about the 
<A NAME="309"></A>emigration of its own people to other countries, and the reception of strangers 
<A NAME="310"></A>from elsewhere. About these matters the legislator has to consider, and 
<A NAME="311"></A>he will begin by trying to persuade men as far as he can. The intercourse 
<A NAME="312"></A>of cities with one another is apt to create a confusion of manners; strangers, 
<A NAME="313"></A>are always suggesting novelties to strangers. When states are well governed 
<A NAME="314"></A>by good laws the mixture causes the greatest possible injury; but seeing 
<A NAME="315"></A>that most cities are the reverse of well-ordered, the confusion which arises 
<A NAME="316"></A>in them from the reception of strangers, and from the citizens themselves 
<A NAME="317"></A>rushing off into other cities, when any one either young or old desires 
<A NAME="318"></A>to travel anywhere abroad at whatever time, is of no consequence. On the 
<A NAME="319"></A>other hand, the refusal of states to receive others, and for their own 
<A NAME="320"></A>citizens never to go to other places, is an utter impossibility, and to 
<A NAME="321"></A>the rest of the world is likely to appear ruthless and uncivilized; it 
<A NAME="322"></A>is a practise adopted by people who use harsh words, such as xenelasia 
<A NAME="323"></A>or banishment of strangers, and who have harsh and morose ways, as men 
<A NAME="324"></A>think. And to be thought or not to be thought well of by the rest of the 
<A NAME="325"></A>world is no light matter; for the many are not so far wrong in their judgment 
<A NAME="326"></A>of who are bad and who are good, as they are removed from the nature of 
<A NAME="327"></A>virtue in themselves. Even bad men have a divine instinct which guesses 
<A NAME="328"></A>rightly, and very many who are utterly depraved form correct notions and 
<A NAME="329"></A>judgments of the differences between the good and bad. And the generality 
<A NAME="330"></A>of cities are quite right in exhorting us to value a good reputation in 
<A NAME="331"></A>the world, for there is no truth greater and more important than this-that 
<A NAME="332"></A>he who is really good (I am speaking of the man who would be perfect) seeks 
<A NAME="333"></A>for reputation with, but not without, the reality of goodness. And our 
<A NAME="334"></A>Cretan colony ought also to acquire the fairest and noblest reputation 
<A NAME="335"></A>for virtue from other men; and there is every reason to expect that, if 
<A NAME="336"></A>the reality answers to the idea, she will before of the few well-ordered 
<A NAME="337"></A>cities which the sun and the other Gods behold. Wherefore, in the matter 
<A NAME="338"></A>of journeys to other countries and the reception of strangers, we enact 
<A NAME="339"></A>as follows:-In the first place, let no one be allowed to go anywhere at 
<A NAME="340"></A>all into a foreign country who is less than forty years of age; and no 
<A NAME="341"></A>one shall go in a private capacity, but only in some public one, as a herald, 
<A NAME="342"></A>or on an embassy; or on a sacred mission. Going abroad on an expedition 
<A NAME="343"></A>or in war, not to be included among travels of the class authorized by 
<A NAME="344"></A>the state. To Apollo at Delphi and to Zeus at Olympia and to Nemea and 
<A NAME="345"></A>to the Isthmus,-citizens should be sent to take part in the sacrifices 
<A NAME="346"></A>and games there dedicated to the Gods; and they should send as many as 
<A NAME="347"></A>possible, and the best and fairest that can be found, and they will make 
<A NAME="348"></A>the city renowned at holy meetings in time of peace, procuring a glory 
<A NAME="349"></A>which shall be the converse of that which is gained in war; and when they 
<A NAME="350"></A>come home they shall teach the young that the institutions of other states 
<A NAME="351"></A>are inferior to their own. And they shall send spectators of another sort, 
<A NAME="352"></A>if they have the consent of the guardians, being such citizens as desire 
<A NAME="353"></A>to look a little more at leisure at the doings of other men; and these 
<A NAME="354"></A>no law shall hinder. For a city which has no experience of good and bad 
<A NAME="355"></A>men or intercourse with them, can never be thoroughly, and perfectly civilized, 
<A NAME="356"></A>nor, again, can the citizens of a city properly observe the laws by habit 
<A NAME="357"></A>only, and without an intelligent understanding of them. And there always 
<A NAME="358"></A>are in the world a few inspired men whose acquaintance is beyond price, 
<A NAME="359"></A>and who spring up quite as much in ill-ordered as in well-ordered cities. 
<A NAME="360"></A>These are they whom the citizens of a well ordered city should be ever 
<A NAME="361"></A>seeking out, going forth over sea and over land to find him who is incorruptible-that 
<A NAME="362"></A>he may establish more firmly institutions in his own state which are good 
<A NAME="363"></A>already; and amend what is deficient; for without this examination and 
<A NAME="364"></A>enquiry a city will never continue perfect any more than if the examination 
<A NAME="365"></A>is ill-conducted.
<A NAME="366"></A><BR><BR><B>Cleinias.</B> How can we have an examination and also a good 
<A NAME="367"></A>one?
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>Athenian Stranger. In this way: In the first place, our spectator shall 
<A NAME="369"></A>be of not less than fifty years of age; he must be a man of reputation, 
<A NAME="370"></A>especially in war, if he is to exhibit to other cities a model of the guardians 
<A NAME="371"></A>of the law, but when he is more than sixty years of age he shall no longer 
<A NAME="372"></A>continue in his office of spectator, And when he has carried on his inspection 
<A NAME="373"></A>during as many out of the ten years of his office as he pleases, on his 
<A NAME="374"></A>return home let him go to the assembly of those who review the laws. This 
<A NAME="375"></A>shall be a mixed body of young and old men, who shall be required to meet 
<A NAME="376"></A>daily between the hour of dawn and the rising of the sun. They shall consist, 
<A NAME="377"></A>in the first place, of the priests who have obtained the rewards of virtue; 
<A NAME="378"></A>and in the second place, of guardians of the law, the ten eldest being 
<A NAME="379"></A>chosen; the general superintendent of education shall also be member, as 
<A NAME="380"></A>well the last appointed as those who have been released from the office; 
<A NAME="381"></A>and each of them shall take with him as his companion young man, whomsoever 
<A NAME="382"></A>he chooses, between the ages of thirty and forty. These shall be always 
<A NAME="383"></A>holding conversation and discourse about the laws of their own city or 
<A NAME="384"></A>about any specially good ones which they may hear to be existing elsewhere; 
<A NAME="385"></A>also about kinds of knowledge which may appear to be of use and will throw 
<A NAME="386"></A>light upon the examination, or of which the want will make the subject 
<A NAME="387"></A>of laws dark and uncertain to them. Any knowledge of this sort which the 
<A NAME="388"></A>elders approve, the younger men shall learn with all diligence; and if 
<A NAME="389"></A>any one of those who have been invited appear to be unworthy, the whole 
<A NAME="390"></A>assembly shall blame him who invited him. The rest of the city shall watch 
<A NAME="391"></A>over those among the young men who distinguish themselves, having an eye 
<A NAME="392"></A>upon them, and especially honouring them if they succeed, but dishonouring 
<A NAME="393"></A>them above the rest if they turn out to be inferior. This is the assembly 
<A NAME="394"></A>to which he who has visited the institutions of other men, on his return 
<A NAME="395"></A>home shall straightway go, and if he have discovered any one who has anything 
<A NAME="396"></A>to say about the enactment of laws or education or nurture, or if he have 
<A NAME="397"></A>himself made any observations, let him communicate his discoveries to the 
<A NAME="398"></A>whole assembly. And if he be seen to have come home neither better nor 
<A NAME="399"></A>worse, let him be praised at any rate for his enthusiasm; and if he be 
<A NAME="400"></A>much better, let him be praised so much the more; and not only while he 
<A NAME="401"></A>lives but after his death let the assembly honour him with fitting honours. 
<A NAME="402"></A>But if on his return home he appear to have been corrupted, pretending 
<A NAME="403"></A>to be wise when he is not, let him hold no communication with any one, 
<A NAME="404"></A>whether young or old; and if he will hearken to the rulers, then he shall 
<A NAME="405"></A>be permitted to live as a private individual; but if he will not, let him 
<A NAME="406"></A>die, if he be convicted in a court of law of interfering about education 
<A NAME="407"></A>and the laws, And if he deserve to be indicted, and none of the magistrates 
<A NAME="408"></A>indict him, let that be counted as a disgrace to them when the rewards 
<A NAME="409"></A>of virtue are decided.
<A NAME="410"></A><BR><BR>Let such be the character of the person who goes abroad, and let 
<A NAME="411"></A>him go abroad under these conditions. In the next place, the stranger who 
<A NAME="412"></A>comes from abroad should be received in a friendly spirit. Now there are 
<A NAME="413"></A>four kinds of strangers, of whom we must make some mention-the first is 
<A NAME="414"></A>he who comes and stays throughout the summer; this class are like birds 
<A NAME="415"></A>of passage, taking wing in pursuit of commerce, and flying over the sea 
<A NAME="416"></A>to other cities, while the season lasts; he shall be received in market-places 
<A NAME="417"></A>and harbours and public buildings, near the city but outside, by those 
<A NAME="418"></A>magistrates who are appointed to superintend these matters; and they shall 
<A NAME="419"></A>take care that a stranger, whoever he be, duly receives justice; but he 
<A NAME="420"></A>shall not be allowed to make any innovation. They shall hold the intercourse 
<A NAME="421"></A>with him which is necessary, and this shall be as little as possible. The 
<A NAME="422"></A>second kind is just a spectator who comes to see with his eyes and hear 
<A NAME="423"></A>with his ears the festivals of the Muses; such ought to have entertainment 
<A NAME="424"></A>provided them at the temples by hospitable persons, and the priests and 
<A NAME="425"></A>ministers of the temples should see and attend to them. But they should 
<A NAME="426"></A>not remain more than a reasonable time; let them see and hear that for 
<A NAME="427"></A>the sake of which they came, and then go away, neither having suffered 
<A NAME="428"></A>nor done any harm. The priests shall be their judges, if any of them receive 
<A NAME="429"></A>or do any wrong up to the sum of fifty drachmae, but if any greater charge 
<A NAME="430"></A>be brought, in such cases the suit shall come before the wardens of the 
<A NAME="431"></A>agora. The third kind of stranger is he who comes on some public business 
<A NAME="432"></A>from another land, and is to be received with public honours. He is to 
<A NAME="433"></A>be received only by the generals and commanders of horse and foot, and 
<A NAME="434"></A>the host by whom he is entertained, in conjunction with the Prytanes, shall 
<A NAME="435"></A>have the sole charge of what concerns him. There is a fourth dass of persons 
<A NAME="436"></A>answering to our spectators, who come from another land to look at ours. 
<A NAME="437"></A>In the first place, such visits will be rare, and the visitor should be 
<A NAME="438"></A>at least fifty years of age; he may possibly be wanting to see something 
<A NAME="439"></A>that is rich and rare in other states, or himself to show something in 
<A NAME="440"></A>like manner to another city. Let such an one, then, go unbidden to the 
<A NAME="441"></A>doors of the wise and rich, being one of them himself: let him go, for 
<A NAME="442"></A>example, to the house of the superintendent of education, confident that 
<A NAME="443"></A>he is a fitting guest of such a host, or let him go to the house of some 
<A NAME="444"></A>of those who have gained the prize of virtue and hold discourse with them, 
<A NAME="445"></A>both learning from them, and also teaching them; and when he has seen and 
<A NAME="446"></A>heard all, he shall depart, as a friend taking leave of friends, and be 
<A NAME="447"></A>honoured by them with gifts and suitable tributes of respect. These are 
<A NAME="448"></A>the customs, according to which our city should receive all strangers of 
<A NAME="449"></A>either sex who come from other countries, and should send forth her own 
<A NAME="450"></A>citizens, showing respect to Zeus, the God of hospitality, not forbidding 
<A NAME="451"></A>strangers at meals and sacrifices, as is the manner which prevails among 
<A NAME="452"></A>the children of the Nile, nor driving them away by savage 
<A NAME="453"></A>proclamations.
<A NAME="454"></A><BR><BR>When a man becomes surety, let him give the security in a distinct 
<A NAME="455"></A>form, acknowledging the whole transaction in a written document, and in 
<A NAME="456"></A>the presence of not less than three witnesses if the sum be under a thousand 
<A NAME="457"></A>drachmae, and of not less than five witnesses if the sum be above a thousand 
<A NAME="458"></A>drachmae. The agent of a dishonest or untrustworthy seller shall himself 
<A NAME="459"></A>be responsible; both the agent and the principal shall be equally liable. 
<A NAME="460"></A>If a person wishes to find anything in the house of another, he shall enter 
<A NAME="461"></A>naked, or wearing only a short tunic and without a girdle, having first 
<A NAME="462"></A>taken an oath by the customary Gods that he expects to find it there; he 
<A NAME="463"></A>shall then make his search, and the other shall throw open his house and 
<A NAME="464"></A>allow him to search things both sealed and unsealed. And if a person will 
<A NAME="465"></A>not allow the searcher to make his search, he who is prevented shall go 
<A NAME="466"></A>to law with him, estimating the value of the goods after which he is searching, 
<A NAME="467"></A>and if the other be convicted he shall pay twice the value of the article. 
<A NAME="468"></A>If the master be absent from home, the dwellers in the house shall let 
<A NAME="469"></A>him search the unsealed property, and on the sealed property the searcher 
<A NAME="470"></A>shall set another seal, and shall appoint any one whom he likes to guard 
<A NAME="471"></A>them during five days; and if the master of the house be absent during 
<A NAME="472"></A>a longer time, he shall take with him the wardens of the city, and so make 
<A NAME="473"></A>his search, opening the sealed property as well as the unsealed, and then, 
<A NAME="474"></A>together with the members of the family and the wardens of the city, he 
<A NAME="475"></A>shall seal them up again as they were before. There shall be a limit of 
<A NAME="476"></A>time in the case of disputed things, and he who has had possession of them 
<A NAME="477"></A>during a certain time shall no longer be liable to be disturbed. As to 
<A NAME="478"></A>houses and lands there can be no dispute in this state of ours; but if 
<A NAME="479"></A>a man has any other possessions which he has used and openly shown in the 
<A NAME="480"></A>city and in the agora and in the temples, and no one has put in a claim 
<A NAME="481"></A>to them, and some one says that he was looking for them during this time, 
<A NAME="482"></A>and the possessor is proved to have made no concealment, if they have continued 
<A NAME="483"></A>for a year, the one having the goods and the other looking for them, the 
<A NAME="484"></A>claim of the seeker shall not be allowed after the expiration of the year; 
<A NAME="485"></A>or if he does not use or show the lost property in the market or in the 
<A NAME="486"></A>city, but only in the country, and no one offers himself as the owner during 
<A NAME="487"></A>five years, at the expiration of the five years the claim shall be barred 
<A NAME="488"></A>for ever after; or if he uses them in the city but within the house, then 
<A NAME="489"></A>the appointed time of claiming the goods shall be three years, or ten years 
<A NAME="490"></A>if he has them in the country in private. And if he has them in another 
<A NAME="491"></A>land, there shall be no limit of time or prescription, but whenever the 
<A NAME="492"></A>owner finds them he may claim them.
<A NAME="493"></A><BR><BR>If any one prevents another by force from being present at a trial, 
<A NAME="494"></A>whether a principal party or his witnesses; if the person prevented be 
<A NAME="495"></A>a slave, whether his own or belonging to another, the suit shall be incomplete 
<A NAME="496"></A>and invalid; but if he who is prevented be a freeman, besides the suit 
<A NAME="497"></A>being incomplete, the other who has prevented him shall be imprisoned for 
<A NAME="498"></A>a year, and shall be prosecuted for kidnapping by any one who pleases. 
<A NAME="499"></A>And if any one hinders by force a rival competitor in gymnastic or music, 
<A NAME="500"></A>or any other sort of contest, from being present at the contest, let him 
<A NAME="501"></A>who has a mind inform the presiding judges, and they shall liberate him 
<A NAME="502"></A>who is desirous of competing; and if they are not able, and he who hinders 
<A NAME="503"></A>the other from competing wins the prize, then they shall give the prize 
<A NAME="504"></A>of victory to him who is prevented, and inscribe him as the conqueror in 
<A NAME="505"></A>any temples which he pleases; and he who hinders the other shall not be 
<A NAME="506"></A>permitted to make any offering or inscription having reference to that 
<A NAME="507"></A>contest, and in any case he shall be liable for damages, whether he be 
<A NAME="508"></A>defeated or whether he conquer.
<A NAME="509"></A><BR><BR>If any one knowingly receives anything which has been stolen, he 
<A NAME="510"></A>shall undergo the same punishment as the thief, and if a man receives an 
<A NAME="511"></A>exile he shall be punished with death. Every man should regard the friend 
<A NAME="512"></A>and enemy of the state as his own friend and enemy; and if any one makes 
<A NAME="513"></A>peace or war with another on his own account, and without the authority 
<A NAME="514"></A>of the state, he, like the receiver of the exile, shall undergo the penalty 
<A NAME="515"></A>of death. And if any fraction of the City declare war or peace against 
<A NAME="516"></A>any, the generals shall indict the authors of this proceeding, and if they 
<A NAME="517"></A>are convicted death shall be the penalty. Those who serve their country 
<A NAME="518"></A>ought to serve without receiving gifts, and there ought to be no excusing 
<A NAME="519"></A>or approving the saying, "Men should receive gifts as the reward of good, 
<A NAME="520"></A>but not of evil deeds"; for to know which we are doing, and to stand fast 
<A NAME="521"></A>by our knowledge, is no easy matter. The safest course is to obey the law 
<A NAME="522"></A>which says, "Do no service for a bribe," and let him who disobeys, if he 
<A NAME="523"></A>be convicted, simply die. With a view to taxation, for various reasons, 
<A NAME="524"></A>every man ought to have had his property valued: and the tribesmen should 
<A NAME="525"></A>likewise bring a register of the yearly produce to the wardens of the country, 
<A NAME="526"></A>that in this way there may be two valuations; and the public officers may 
<A NAME="527"></A>use annuary whichever on consideration they deem the best, whether they 
<A NAME="528"></A>prefer to take a certain portion of the whole value, or of the annual revenue, 
<A NAME="529"></A>after subtracting what is paid to the common tables.
<A NAME="530"></A><BR><BR>Touching offerings to the Gods, a moderate man should observe moderation 
<A NAME="531"></A>in what he offers. Now the land and the hearth of the house of all men 
<A NAME="532"></A>is sacred to all Gods; wherefore let no man dedicate them a second time 
<A NAME="533"></A>to the Gods. Gold and silver, whether possessed by private persons or in 
<A NAME="534"></A>temples, are in other cities provocative of envy, and ivory, the product 
<A NAME="535"></A>of a dead body, is not a proper offering; brass and iron, again, are instruments 
<A NAME="536"></A>of war; but of wood let a man bring what offerings he likes, provided it 
<A NAME="537"></A>be a single block, and in like manner of stone, to the public temples; 
<A NAME="538"></A>of woven work let him not offer more than one woman can execute in a month. 
<A NAME="539"></A>White is a colour suitable to the Gods, especially in woven works, but 
<A NAME="540"></A>dyes should only be used for the adornments of war. The most divine of 
<A NAME="541"></A>gifts are birds and images, and they should be such as one painter can 
<A NAME="542"></A>execute in a single day. And let all other offerings follow a similar 
<A NAME="543"></A>rule.
<A NAME="544"></A><BR><BR>Now that the whole city has been divided into parts of which the 
<A NAME="545"></A>nature and number have been described, and laws have been given about all 
<A NAME="546"></A>the most important contracts as far as this was possible, the next thing 
<A NAME="547"></A>will be to have justice done. The first of the courts shall consist of 
<A NAME="548"></A>elected judges, who shall be chosen by the plaintiff and the defendant 
<A NAME="549"></A>in common: these shall be called arbiters rather than judges. And in the 
<A NAME="550"></A>second court there shall be judges of the villages and tribes corresponding 
<A NAME="551"></A>to the twelvefold division of the land, and before these the litigants 
<A NAME="552"></A>shall go to contend for greater damages, if the suit be not decided before 
<A NAME="553"></A>the first judges; the defendant, if he be defeated the second time, shall 
<A NAME="554"></A>pay a fifth more than the damages mentioned in the indictment; and if he 
<A NAME="555"></A>find fault with his judges and would try a third time, let him carry the 
<A NAME="556"></A>suit before the select judges, and if he be again defeated, let him pay 
<A NAME="557"></A>the whole of the damages and half as much again. And the plaintiff, if 
<A NAME="558"></A>when defeated before the first judges he persist in going on to the second, 
<A NAME="559"></A>shall if he wins receive in addition to the damages a fifth part more, 
<A NAME="560"></A>and if defeated he shall pay a like sum; but if he is not satisfied with 
<A NAME="561"></A>the previous decision, and will insist on proceeding to a third court, 
<A NAME="562"></A>then if he win he shall receive from the defendant the amount of the damages 
<A NAME="563"></A>and, as I said before, half as much again, and the plaintiff, if he lose, 
<A NAME="564"></A>shall pay half of the damages claimed, Now the assignment by lot of judges 
<A NAME="565"></A>to courts and the completion of the number of them, and the appointment 
<A NAME="566"></A>of servants to the different magistrates, and the times at which the several 
<A NAME="567"></A>causes should be heard, and the votings and delays, and all the things 
<A NAME="568"></A>that necessarily concern suits, and the order of causes, and the time in 
<A NAME="569"></A>which answers have to be put in and parties are to appear-of these and 
<A NAME="570"></A>other things akin to these we have indeed already spoken, but there is 
<A NAME="571"></A>no harm in repeating what is right twice or thrice:-All lesser and easier 
<A NAME="572"></A>matters which the elder legislator has omitted may be supplied by the younger 
<A NAME="573"></A>one. Private courts will be sufficiently regulated in this way, and the 
<A NAME="574"></A>public and state courts, and those which the magistrates must use in the 
<A NAME="575"></A>administration of their several offices, exist in many other states. Many 
<A NAME="576"></A>very respectable institutions of this sort have been framed by good men, 
<A NAME="577"></A>and from them the guardians of the law may by reflection derive what is 
<A NAME="578"></A>necessary, for the order of our new state, considering and correcting them, 
<A NAME="579"></A>and bringing them to the test of experience, until every detail appears 
<A NAME="580"></A>to be satisfactorily determined; and then putting the final seal upon them, 
<A NAME="581"></A>and making them irreversible, they shall use them for ever afterwards. 
<A NAME="582"></A>As to what relates to the silence of judges and the abstinence from words 
<A NAME="583"></A>of evil omen and the reverse, and the different notions of the just and 
<A NAME="584"></A>good and honourable which exist in our: own as compared with other states, 
<A NAME="585"></A>they have been partly mentioned already, and another part of them will 
<A NAME="586"></A>be mentioned hereafter as we draw near the end. To all these matters he 
<A NAME="587"></A>who would be an equal judge, shall justly look, and he shall possess writings 
<A NAME="588"></A>about them that he may learn them. For of all kinds of knowledge the knowledge 
<A NAME="589"></A>of good laws has the greatest power of improving the learner; otherwise 
<A NAME="590"></A>there would be no meaning the divine and admirable law possessing a name 
<A NAME="591"></A>akin to mind (nous, nomos). And of all other words, such as the praises 
<A NAME="592"></A>and censures of individuals which occur in poetry and also in prose, whether 
<A NAME="593"></A>written down or uttered in daily conversation, whether men dispute about 
<A NAME="594"></A>them in the spirit of contention or weakly assent to them, as is often 
<A NAME="595"></A>the case-of all these the one sure test is the writings of the legislator, 
<A NAME="596"></A>which the righteous judge ought to have in his mind as the antidote of 
<A NAME="597"></A>all other words, and thus make himself and the city stand upright, procuring 
<A NAME="598"></A>for the good the continuance and increase of justice, and for the bad, 
<A NAME="599"></A>on the other hand, a conversion from ignorance and intemperance, and in 
<A NAME="600"></A>general from all unrighteousness, as far as their evil minds can be healed, 
<A NAME="601"></A>but to those whose web of life is in reality finished, giving death, which 
<A NAME="602"></A>is the only remedy for souls in their condition, as I may say truly again 
<A NAME="603"></A>and again. And such judges and chiefs of judges will be worthy of receiving 
<A NAME="604"></A>praise from the whole city.
<A NAME="605"></A><BR><BR>When the suits of the year are completed the following laws shall 
<A NAME="606"></A>regulate their execution:-In the first place, the judge shall assign to 
<A NAME="607"></A>the party who wins the suit the whole property of him who loses, with the 
<A NAME="608"></A>exception of mere necessaries, and the assignment shall be made through 
<A NAME="609"></A>the herald immediately after each decision in the hearing of the judges; 
<A NAME="610"></A>and when the month arrives following the month in which the courts are 
<A NAME="611"></A>sitting (unless the gainer of the suit has been previously satisfied), 
<A NAME="612"></A>the court shall follow up the case, and hand over to the winner the goods 
<A NAME="613"></A>of the loser; but if they find that he has not the means of paying, and 
<A NAME="614"></A>the sum deficient is not less than a drachma, the insolvent person shall 
<A NAME="615"></A>not have any right of going to law with any other man until he have satisfied 
<A NAME="616"></A>the debt of the winning party; but other persons shall still have the right 
<A NAME="617"></A>of bringing suits against him. And if any one after he is condemned refuses 
<A NAME="618"></A>to acknowledge the authority which condemned him, let the magistrates who 
<A NAME="619"></A>are thus deprived of their authority bring him before the court of the 
<A NAME="620"></A>guardians of the law, and if he be cast, let him be punished with death, 
<A NAME="621"></A>as a subverter of the whole state and of the laws.
<A NAME="622"></A><BR><BR>Thus a man is born and brought up, and after this manner he begets 
<A NAME="623"></A>and brings up his own children, and has his share of dealings with other 
<A NAME="624"></A>men, and suffers if he has done wrong to any one, and receives satisfaction 
<A NAME="625"></A>if he has been wronged, and so at length in due time he grows old under 
<A NAME="626"></A>the protection of the laws, and his end comes in the order of nature. Concerning 
<A NAME="627"></A>the dead of either sex, the religious ceremonies which may fittingly be 
<A NAME="628"></A>performed, whether appertaining to the Gods of the underworld or of this, 
<A NAME="629"></A>shall be decided by the interpreters with absolute authority. Their sepulchres 
<A NAME="630"></A>are not to be in places which are fit for cultivation, and there shall 
<A NAME="631"></A>be no monuments in such spots, either large or small, but they shall occupy 
<A NAME="632"></A>that part of the country which is naturally adapted for receiving and concealing 
<A NAME="633"></A>the bodies of the dead with as little hurt as possible to the living. No 
<A NAME="634"></A>man, living or dead, shall deprive the living of the sustenance which the 
<A NAME="635"></A>earth, their foster-parent, is naturally inclined to provide for them. 
<A NAME="636"></A>And let not the mound be piled higher than would be the work of five men 
<A NAME="637"></A>completed in five days; nor shall the stone which is placed over the spot 
<A NAME="638"></A>be larger than would be sufficient to receive the praises of the dead included 
<A NAME="639"></A>in four heroic lines. Nor shall the laying out of the dead in the house 
<A NAME="640"></A>continue for a longer time than is sufficient to distinguish between him 
<A NAME="641"></A>who is in a trance only and him who is really dead, and speaking generally, 
<A NAME="642"></A>the third day after death will be a fair time for carrying out the body 
<A NAME="643"></A>to the sepulchre. Now we must believe the legislator when he tells us that 
<A NAME="644"></A>the soul is in all respects superior to the body, and that even in life 
<A NAME="645"></A>what makes each one us to be what we are is only the soul; and that the 
<A NAME="646"></A>body follows us about in the likeness of each of us, and therefore, when 
<A NAME="647"></A>we are dead, the bodies of the dead are quite rightly said to be our shades 
<A NAME="648"></A>or images; for the true and immortal being of each one of us which is called 
<A NAME="649"></A>the soul goes on her way to other Gods, before them to give an account-which 
<A NAME="650"></A>is an inspiring hope to the good, but very terrible to the bad, as the 
<A NAME="651"></A>laws of our fathers tell us; and they also say that not much can be done 
<A NAME="652"></A>in the way of helping a man after he is dead. But the living-he should 
<A NAME="653"></A>be helped by all his kindred, that while in life he may be the holiest 
<A NAME="654"></A>and justest of men, and after death may have no great sins to be punished 
<A NAME="655"></A>in the world below. If this be true, a man ought not to waste his substance 
<A NAME="656"></A>under the idea that all this lifeless mass of flesh which is in process 
<A NAME="657"></A>of burial is connected with him; he should consider that the son, or brother, 
<A NAME="658"></A>or the beloved one, whoever he may be, whom he thinks he is laying in the 
<A NAME="659"></A>earth, has gone away to complete and fulfil his own destiny, and that his 
<A NAME="660"></A>duty is rightly to order the present, and to spend moderately on the lifeless 
<A NAME="661"></A>altar of the Gods below. But the legislator does not intend moderation 
<A NAME="662"></A>to be take, in the sense of meanness. Let the law, then, be as follows:-The 
<A NAME="663"></A>expenditure on the entire funeral of him who is of the highest class shall 
<A NAME="664"></A>not exceed five minae; and for him who is of the second class, three minae, 
<A NAME="665"></A>and for him who is of the third class, two minae, and for him, who is of 
<A NAME="666"></A>the fourth class, one mina, will be a fair limit of expense. The guardians 
<A NAME="667"></A>of the law ought to take especial care of the different ages of life, whether 
<A NAME="668"></A>childhood, or manhood, or any other age. And at the end of all, let there 
<A NAME="669"></A>be some one guardian of the law presiding, who shall be chosen by the friends 
<A NAME="670"></A>of the deceased to superintend, and let it be glory to him to manage with 
<A NAME="671"></A>fairness and moderation what relates to the dead, and a discredit to him 
<A NAME="672"></A>if they are not well managed. Let the laying out and other ceremonies be 
<A NAME="673"></A>in accordance with custom, but to the statesman who adopts custom as his 
<A NAME="674"></A>law we must give way in certain particulars. It would be monstrous for 
<A NAME="675"></A>example that he should command any man to weep or abstain from weeping 
<A NAME="676"></A>over the dead; but he may forbid cries of lamentation, and not allow the 
<A NAME="677"></A>voice of the mourner to be heard outside the house; also, he may forbid 
<A NAME="678"></A>the bringing of the dead body into the open streets, or the processions 
<A NAME="679"></A>of mourners in the streets, and may require that before daybreak they should 
<A NAME="680"></A>be outside the city. Let these, then, be our laws relating to such matters, 
<A NAME="681"></A>and let him who obeys be free from penalty; but he who disobeys even a 
<A NAME="682"></A>single guardian of the law shall be punished by them all with a fitting 
<A NAME="683"></A>penalty. Other modes of burial, or again the denial of burial, which is 
<A NAME="684"></A>to be refused in the case of robbers of temples and parricides and the 
<A NAME="685"></A>like, have been devised and are embodied in the preceding laws, so that 
<A NAME="686"></A>now our work of legislation is pretty nearly at an end; but in all cases 
<A NAME="687"></A>the end does not consist in doing something or acquiring something or establishing 
<A NAME="688"></A>something-the end will be attained and finally accomplished, when we have 
<A NAME="689"></A>provided for the perfect and lasting continuance of our institutions until 
<A NAME="690"></A>then our creation is incomplete.
<A NAME="691"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> That is very good Stranger; but I wish you would tell 
<A NAME="692"></A>me more clearly what you mean.
<A NAME="693"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> O Cleinias, many things of old time were well said 
<A NAME="694"></A>and sung; and the saying about the Fates was one of 
<A NAME="695"></A>them.
<A NAME="696"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What is it?
<A NAME="697"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> The saying that Lachesis or the giver of the lots is the 
<A NAME="698"></A>first of them, and that Clotho or the spinster is the second of them, and 
<A NAME="699"></A>that Atropos or the unchanging one is the third of them; and that she is 
<A NAME="700"></A>the preserver of the things which we have spoken, and which have been compared 
<A NAME="701"></A>in a figure to things woven by fire, they both (i.e., Atropos and the fire) 
<A NAME="702"></A>producing the quality of unchangeableness. I am speaking of the things 
<A NAME="703"></A>which in a state and government give not only health and salvation to the 
<A NAME="704"></A>body, but law, or rather preservation of the law, in the soul; and, if 
<A NAME="705"></A>I am not mistaken, this seems to be still wanting in our laws: we have 
<A NAME="706"></A>still to see how we can implant in them this irreversible 
<A NAME="707"></A>nature.
<A NAME="708"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> It will be no small matter if we can only discover 
<A NAME="709"></A>how such a nature can be implanted in anything.
<A NAME="710"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> But it certainly can be; so much I clearly 
<A NAME="711"></A>see.
<A NAME="712"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> Then let us not think of desisting until we have imparted 
<A NAME="713"></A>this quality to our laws; for it is ridiculous, after a great deal of labour 
<A NAME="714"></A>has been spent, to place a thing at last on an insecure 
<A NAME="715"></A>foundation.
<A NAME="716"></A><BR><BR><B>Megillus.</B> I approve of your suggestion, and am quite of 
<A NAME="717"></A>the same mind with you.
<A NAME="718"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very good: And now what, according to you, is to be 
<A NAME="719"></A>the salvation of our government and of our laws, and how is it to be 
<A NAME="720"></A>effected?
<A NAME="721"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Were we not saying that there must be in our city a 
<A NAME="722"></A>council which was to be of this sort:-The ten oldest guardians of the law, 
<A NAME="723"></A>and all those who have obtained prizes of virtue, were to meet in the same 
<A NAME="724"></A>assembly, and the council was also to include those who had visited foreign 
<A NAME="725"></A>countries in the hope of hearing something that might be of use in the 
<A NAME="726"></A>preservation of the laws, and who, having come safely home, and having 
<A NAME="727"></A>been tested in these same matters, had proved themselves to be worthy to 
<A NAME="728"></A>take part in the assembly;-each of the members was to select some young 
<A NAME="729"></A>man of not less than thirty years of age, he himself judging in the, first 
<A NAME="730"></A>instance whether the young man was worthy by nature and education, and 
<A NAME="731"></A>then suggesting him to the others, and if he seemed to them also to be 
<A NAME="732"></A>worthy they were to adopt him; but if not, the decision at which they arrived 
<A NAME="733"></A>was to be kept a secret from the citizens at large; and, more especially, 
<A NAME="734"></A>from the rejected candidate. The meeting of the council was to be held 
<A NAME="735"></A>early in the morning, when everybody was most at leisure from all other 
<A NAME="736"></A>business, whether public or private-was not something of this sort said 
<A NAME="737"></A>by us before?
<A NAME="738"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> True.
<A NAME="739"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then, returning to the council, I would say further, that 
<A NAME="740"></A>if we let it down to be the anchor of the state, our city, having everything 
<A NAME="741"></A>which is suitable to her, will preserve all that we wish to 
<A NAME="742"></A>preserve.
<A NAME="743"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What do you mean?
<A NAME="744"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Now is the time for me to speak the truth in all 
<A NAME="745"></A>earnestness.
<A NAME="746"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> Well said, and I hope that you will fulfil your 
<A NAME="747"></A>intention.
<A NAME="748"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Know, Cleinias, that everything, in all that it does, has 
<A NAME="749"></A>a natural saviour, as of an animal the soul and the head are the chief 
<A NAME="750"></A>saviours.
<A NAME="751"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Once more, what do you mean?
<A NAME="752"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> The well-being of those two is obviously the preservation 
<A NAME="753"></A>of every living thing.
<A NAME="754"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> How is that?
<A NAME="755"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> The soul, besides other things, contains mind, and the 
<A NAME="756"></A>head, besides other things, contains sight and hearing; and the mind, mingling 
<A NAME="757"></A>with the noblest of the senses, and becoming one with them, may be truly 
<A NAME="758"></A>called the salvation of all.
<A NAME="759"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes, Quite so.
<A NAME="760"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Yes, indeed; but with what is that intellect concerned 
<A NAME="761"></A>which, mingling with the senses, is the salvation of ships in storms as 
<A NAME="762"></A>well as in fair weather? In a ship, when the pilot and the sailors unite 
<A NAME="763"></A>their perceptions with the piloting mind, do they not save both themselves 
<A NAME="764"></A>and their craft?
<A NAME="765"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="766"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> We do not want many illustrations about such matters:-What 
<A NAME="767"></A>aim would the general of an army, or what aim would a physician propose 
<A NAME="768"></A>to himself, if he were seeking to attain salvation?
<A NAME="769"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very good.
<A NAME="770"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Does not the general aim at victory and superiority in 
<A NAME="771"></A>war, and do not the physician and his assistants aim at producing health 
<A NAME="772"></A>in the body?
<A NAME="773"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="774"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And a physician who is ignorant about the body, that is 
<A NAME="775"></A>to say, who knows not that which we just now called health, or a general 
<A NAME="776"></A>who knows not victory, or any others who are ignorant of the particulars 
<A NAME="777"></A>of the arts which we mentioned, cannot be said to have understanding about 
<A NAME="778"></A>any of these matters.
<A NAME="779"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> They cannot.
<A NAME="780"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And what would you say of the state? If a person proves 
<A NAME="781"></A>to be ignorant of the aim to which the statesman should look, ought he, 
<A NAME="782"></A>in the first place, to be called a ruler at all; further, will he ever 
<A NAME="783"></A>be able to preserve that of which he does not even know the 
<A NAME="784"></A>aim?
<A NAME="785"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Impossible.
<A NAME="786"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And therefore, if our settlement of the country is to be 
<A NAME="787"></A>perfect, we ought to have some institution, which, as I was saying, will 
<A NAME="788"></A>tell what is the aim of the state, and will inform us how we are to attain 
<A NAME="789"></A>this, and what law or what man will advise us to that end. Any state which 
<A NAME="790"></A>has no such institution is likely to be devoid of mind and sense, and in 
<A NAME="791"></A>all her actions will proceed by mere chance.
<A NAME="792"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="793"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> In which, then, of the parts or institutions of the state 
<A NAME="794"></A>is any such guardian power to be found? Can we say?
<A NAME="795"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> I am not quite certain, Stranger; but I have a suspicion 
<A NAME="796"></A>that you are referring to the assembly which you just now said was to meet 
<A NAME="797"></A>at night.
<A NAME="798"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> You understand me perfectly, Cleinias; and we must 
<A NAME="799"></A>assume, as the argument iniplies, that this council possesses all virtue; 
<A NAME="800"></A>and the beginning of virtue is not to make mistakes by guessing many things, 
<A NAME="801"></A>but to look steadily at one thing, and on this to fix all our 
<A NAME="802"></A>aims.
<A NAME="803"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Quite true.
<A NAME="804"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then now we shall see why there is nothing wonderful in 
<A NAME="805"></A>states going astray-the reason is that their legislators have such different 
<A NAME="806"></A>aims; nor is there anything wonderful in some laying down as their rule 
<A NAME="807"></A>of justice, that certain individuals should bear rule in the state, whether 
<A NAME="808"></A>they be good or bad, and others that the citizens should be rich, not caring 
<A NAME="809"></A>whether they are the slaves of other men or not. The tendency of others, 
<A NAME="810"></A>again, is towards freedom; and some legislate with a view to two things 
<A NAME="811"></A>at once-they want to be at the same time free and the lords of other states; 
<A NAME="812"></A>but the wisest men, as they deem themselves to be, look to all these and 
<A NAME="813"></A>similar aims, and there is no one of them which they exclusively honour, 
<A NAME="814"></A>and to which they would have all things look.
<A NAME="815"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Then, Stranger, our former assertion will hold, for 
<A NAME="816"></A>we were saying that laws generally should look to one thing only; and this, 
<A NAME="817"></A>as we admitted, was rightly said to be virtue.
<A NAME="818"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="819"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> And we said that virtue was of four 
<A NAME="820"></A>kinds?
<A NAME="821"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Quite true.
<A NAME="822"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> And that mind was the leader of the four, and that to her 
<A NAME="823"></A>the three other virtues and all other things ought to have 
<A NAME="824"></A>regard?
<A NAME="825"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> You follow me capitally, Cleinias, and I would ask 
<A NAME="826"></A>you to follow me to the end, for we have already said that the mind of 
<A NAME="827"></A>the pilot, the mind of the physician and of the general look to that one 
<A NAME="828"></A>thing to which they ought to look; and now we may turn to mind political, 
<A NAME="829"></A>of which, as of a human creature, we will ask a question:-O wonderful being, 
<A NAME="830"></A>and to what are you looking? The physician is able to tell his single aim 
<A NAME="831"></A>in life, but you, the superior, as you declare yourself to be, of all intelligent 
<A NAME="832"></A>beings, when you are asked are not able to tell. Can you, Megillus, and 
<A NAME="833"></A>you, Cleinias, say distinctly what is the aim of mind political, in return 
<A NAME="834"></A>for the many explanations of things which I have given 
<A NAME="835"></A>you?
<A NAME="836"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> We cannot, Stranger.
<A NAME="837"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Well, but ought we not to desire to see it, and to see 
<A NAME="838"></A>where it is to be found?
<A NAME="839"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> For example, where?
<A NAME="840"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> For example, we were saying that there are four kinds of 
<A NAME="841"></A>virtue, and as there are four of them, each of them must be 
<A NAME="842"></A>one.
<A NAME="843"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="844"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And further, all four of them we call one; for we say that 
<A NAME="845"></A>courage is virtue, and that prudence is virtue, and the same of the two 
<A NAME="846"></A>others, as if they were in reality not many but one, that is, 
<A NAME="847"></A>virtue.
<A NAME="848"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Quite so.
<A NAME="849"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> There is no difficulty in seeing in what way the two differ 
<A NAME="850"></A>from one another, and have received two names, and so of the rest. But 
<A NAME="851"></A>there is more difficulty in explaining why we call these two and the rest 
<A NAME="852"></A>of them by the single name of virtue.
<A NAME="853"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> How do you mean?
<A NAME="854"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I have no difficulty in explaining what I mean. Let us 
<A NAME="855"></A>distribute the subject questions and answers.
<A NAME="856"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Once more, what do you mean?
<A NAME="857"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Ask me what is that one thing which call virtue, and then 
<A NAME="858"></A>again speak of as two, one part being courage and the other wisdom. I will 
<A NAME="859"></A>tell you how that occurs:-One of them has to do with fear; in this the 
<A NAME="860"></A>beasts also participate, and quite young children-I mean courage; for a 
<A NAME="861"></A>courageous temper is a gift of nature and not of reason. But without reason 
<A NAME="862"></A>there never has been, or is, or will be a wise and understanding soul; 
<A NAME="863"></A>it is of a different nature.
<A NAME="864"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> That is true.
<A NAME="865"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I have now told you in what way the two are different, 
<A NAME="866"></A>and do you in return tell me in what way they are one and the same. Suppose 
<A NAME="867"></A>that I ask you in what way the four are one, and when you have answered 
<A NAME="868"></A>me, you will have a right to ask of me in return in what way they are four; 
<A NAME="869"></A>and then let us proceed to enquire whether in the case of things which 
<A NAME="870"></A>have a name and also a definition to them, true knowledge consists in knowing 
<A NAME="871"></A>the name only and not the definition. Can he who is good for anything be 
<A NAME="872"></A>ignorant of all this without discredit where great and glorious truths 
<A NAME="873"></A>are concerned?
<A NAME="874"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> I suppose not.
<A NAME="875"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And is there anything greater to the legislator and the 
<A NAME="876"></A>guardian of the law, and to him who thinks that he excels all other men 
<A NAME="877"></A>in virtue, and has won the palm of excellence, that these very qualities 
<A NAME="878"></A>of which we are now speaking-courage, temperance, wisdom, 
<A NAME="879"></A>justice?
<A NAME="880"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> How can there be anything greater?
<A NAME="881"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And ought not the interpreters, the teachers the lawgivers, 
<A NAME="882"></A>the guardians of the other citizens, to excel the rest of mankind, and 
<A NAME="883"></A>perfectly to show him who desires to learn and know or whose evil actions 
<A NAME="884"></A>require to be punished and reproved, what is the nature of virtue and vice? 
<A NAME="885"></A>Or shall some poet who has found his way into the city, or some chance 
<A NAME="886"></A>person who pretends to be an instructor of youth, show himself to be better 
<A NAME="887"></A>than him who has won the prize for every virtue? And can we wonder that 
<A NAME="888"></A>when the guardians are not adequate in speech or action, and have no adequate 
<A NAME="889"></A>knowledge of virtue, the city being unguarded should experience the common 
<A NAME="890"></A>fate of cities in our day?
<A NAME="891"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Wonder! no.
<A NAME="892"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Well, then, must we do as we said? Or can we give our guardians 
<A NAME="893"></A>a more precise knowledge of virtue in speech and action than the many have? 
<A NAME="894"></A>or is there any way in which our city can be made to resemble the head 
<A NAME="895"></A>and senses of rational beings because possessing such a guardian 
<A NAME="896"></A>power?
<A NAME="897"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What, Stranger, is the drift of your 
<A NAME="898"></A>comparison?
<A NAME="899"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Do we not see that the city is the trunk, and are not the 
<A NAME="900"></A>younger guardians, who are chosen for their natural gifts, placed in the 
<A NAME="901"></A>head of the state, having their souls all full of eyes, with which they 
<A NAME="902"></A>look about the whole city? They keep watch and hand over their perceptions 
<A NAME="903"></A>to the memory, and inform the elders of all that happens in the city; and 
<A NAME="904"></A>those whom we compared to the mind, because they have many wise thoughts-that 
<A NAME="905"></A>is to say, the old men-take counsel and making use of the younger men as 
<A NAME="906"></A>their ministers, and advising with them-in this way both together truly 
<A NAME="907"></A>preserve the whole state:-Shall this or some other be the order of our 
<A NAME="908"></A>state? Are all our citizens to be equal in acquirements, or shall there 
<A NAME="909"></A>be special persons among them who have received a more careful training 
<A NAME="910"></A>and education?
<A NAME="911"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> That they should be equal, my; good, sir, is 
<A NAME="912"></A>impossible.
<A NAME="913"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then we ought to proceed to some more exact training than 
<A NAME="914"></A>any which has preceded.
<A NAME="915"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="916"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And must not that of which we are in need be the one to 
<A NAME="917"></A>which we were just now alluding?
<A NAME="918"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="919"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Did we not say that the workman or guardian, if he be perfect 
<A NAME="920"></A>in every respect, ought not only to be able to see the many aims, but he 
<A NAME="921"></A>should press onward to the one? this he should know, and knowing, order 
<A NAME="922"></A>all things with a view to it.
<A NAME="923"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> True.
<A NAME="924"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And can any one have a more exact way of considering or 
<A NAME="925"></A>contemplating. anything, than the being able to look at one idea gathered 
<A NAME="926"></A>from many different things?
<A NAME="927"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Perhaps not.
<A NAME="928"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Not "Perhaps not," but "Certainly not," my good sir, is 
<A NAME="929"></A>the right answer. There never has been a truer method than this discovered 
<A NAME="930"></A>by any man.
<A NAME="931"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> I bow to your authority, Stranger; let us proceed in 
<A NAME="932"></A>the way which you propose.
<A NAME="933"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then, as would appear, we must compel the guardians 
<A NAME="934"></A>of our divine state to perceive, in the first place, what that principle 
<A NAME="935"></A>is which is the same in all the four-the same, as we affirm, in courage 
<A NAME="936"></A>and in temperance, and in justice and in prudence, and which, being one, 
<A NAME="937"></A>we call as we ought, by the single name of virtue. To this, my friends, 
<A NAME="938"></A>we will, if you please, hold fast, and not let go until we have sufficiently 
<A NAME="939"></A>explained what that is to which we are to look, whether to be regarded 
<A NAME="940"></A>as one, or as a whole, or as both, or in whatever way. Are we likely ever 
<A NAME="941"></A>to be in a virtuous condition, if we cannot tell whether virtue is many, 
<A NAME="942"></A>or four, or one? Certainly, if we take counsel among ourselves, we shall 
<A NAME="943"></A>in some way contrive that this principle has a place amongst us; but if 
<A NAME="944"></A>you have made up your mind that we should let the matter alone, we 
<A NAME="945"></A>will.
<A NAME="946"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> We must not, Stranger, by the God of strangers I swear 
<A NAME="947"></A>that we must not, for in our opinion you speak most truly; but we should 
<A NAME="948"></A>like to know how you will accomplish your purpose.
<A NAME="949"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Wait a little before you ask; and let us, first of 
<A NAME="950"></A>all, be quite agreed with one another that the purpose has to be 
<A NAME="951"></A>accomplished.
<A NAME="952"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly, it ought to be, if it can 
<A NAME="953"></A>be.
<A NAME="954"></A><BR><B>Ast.</B> Well, and about the good and the honourable, are we to 
<A NAME="955"></A>take the same view? Are our guardians only to know that each of them is 
<A NAME="956"></A>many, or, also how and in what way they are one?
<A NAME="957"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> They must consider also in what sense they are 
<A NAME="958"></A>one.
<A NAME="959"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And are they to consider only, and to be unable to set 
<A NAME="960"></A>forth what they think?
<A NAME="961"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly not; that would be the state of a 
<A NAME="962"></A>slave.
<A NAME="963"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And may not the same be said of all good things-that the 
<A NAME="964"></A>true guardians of the laws ought to know the truth about them, and to be 
<A NAME="965"></A>able to interpret them in words, and carry them out in action, judging 
<A NAME="966"></A>of what is and what is not well, according to nature?
<A NAME="967"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="968"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Is not the knowledge of the Gods which we have set forth 
<A NAME="969"></A>with so much zeal one of the noblest sorts of knowledge;-to know that they 
<A NAME="970"></A>are, and know how great is their power, as far as in man lies? do indeed 
<A NAME="971"></A>excuse the mass of the citizens, who only follow the voice of the laws, 
<A NAME="972"></A>but we refuse to admit as guardians any who do not labour to obtain every 
<A NAME="973"></A>possible evidence that there is respecting the Gods; our city is forbidden 
<A NAME="974"></A>and not allowed to choose as a guardian of the law, or to place in the 
<A NAME="975"></A>select order of virtue, him who is not an inspired man, and has not laboured 
<A NAME="976"></A>at these things.
<A NAME="977"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> It is certainly just, as you say, that he who is indolent 
<A NAME="978"></A>about such matters or incapable should be rejected, and that things honourable 
<A NAME="979"></A>should be put away from him.
<A NAME="980"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Are we assured that there are two things which lead 
<A NAME="981"></A>men to believe in the Gods, as we have already stated?
<A NAME="982"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What are they?
<A NAME="983"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> One is the argument about the soul, which has been already 
<A NAME="984"></A>mentioned-that it is the eldest, and most divine of all things, to which 
<A NAME="985"></A>motion attaining generation gives perpetual existence; the other was an 
<A NAME="986"></A>argument from the order of the motion of the stars, and of all things under 
<A NAME="987"></A>the dominion of the mind which ordered the universe. If a man look upon 
<A NAME="988"></A>the world not lightly or ignorantly, there was never any one so godless 
<A NAME="989"></A>who did not experience an effect opposite to that which the many imagine. 
<A NAME="990"></A>For they think that those who handle these matters by the help of astronomy, 
<A NAME="991"></A>and the accompanying arts of demonstration, may become godless, because 
<A NAME="992"></A>they see, as far as they can see, things happening by necessity, and not 
<A NAME="993"></A>by an intelligent will accomplishing good.
<A NAME="994"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> But what is the fact?
<A NAME="995"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Just the opposite, as I said, of the opinion which once 
<A NAME="996"></A>prevailed among men, that the sun and stars are without soul. Even in those 
<A NAME="997"></A>days men wondered about them, and that which is now ascertained was then 
<A NAME="998"></A>conjectured by some who had a more exact knowledge of them-that if they 
<A NAME="999"></A>had been things without soul, and had no mind, they could never have moved 
<A NAME="1000"></A>with numerical exactness so wonderful; and even at that time some ventured 
<A NAME="1001"></A>to hazard the conjecture that mind was the orderer of the universe. But 
<A NAME="1002"></A>these same persons again mistaking the nature of the soul, which they conceived 
<A NAME="1003"></A>to be younger and not older than the body, once more overturned the world, 
<A NAME="1004"></A>or rather, I should say, themselves; for the bodies which they saw moving 
<A NAME="1005"></A>in heaven all appeared to be full of stones, and earth, and many other 
<A NAME="1006"></A>lifeless substances, and to these they assigned the causes of all things. 
<A NAME="1007"></A>Such studies gave rise to much atheism and perplexity, and the poets took 
<A NAME="1008"></A>occasion to be abusive-comparing the philosophers to she-dogs uttering 
<A NAME="1009"></A>vain howlings, and talking other nonsense of the same sort. But now, as 
<A NAME="1010"></A>I said, the case is reversed.
<A NAME="1011"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> How so?
<A NAME="1012"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> No man can be a true worshipper of the Gods who does not 
<A NAME="1013"></A>know these two principles-that the soul is the eldest of all things which 
<A NAME="1014"></A>are born, and is immortal and rules over all bodies; moreover, as I have 
<A NAME="1015"></A>now said several times, he who has not contemplated the mind of nature 
<A NAME="1016"></A>which is said to exist in the stars, and gone through the previous training, 
<A NAME="1017"></A>and seen the connection of music with these things, and harmonized them 
<A NAME="1018"></A>all with laws and institutions, is not able to give a reason of such things 
<A NAME="1019"></A>as have a reason. And he who is unable to acquire this in addition to the 
<A NAME="1020"></A>ordinary virtues of a citizen, can hardly be a good ruler of a whole state; 
<A NAME="1021"></A>but he should be the subordinate of other rulers. Wherefore, Cleinias and 
<A NAME="1022"></A>Megillus, let us consider whether we may not add to all the other laws 
<A NAME="1023"></A>which we have discussed this further one-that the nocturnal assembly of 
<A NAME="1024"></A>the magistrates, which has also shared in the whole scheme of education 
<A NAME="1025"></A>proposed by us, shall be a guard set according to law for the salvation 
<A NAME="1026"></A>of the state. Shall we propose this?
<A NAME="1027"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly, my good friend, we will if the thing is 
<A NAME="1028"></A>in any degree possible.
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Let us make a common effort to gain such an object; 
<A NAME="1030"></A>for I too will gladly share in the attempt. Of these matters I have had 
<A NAME="1031"></A>much experience, and have often considered them, and I dare say that I 
<A NAME="1032"></A>shall be able to find others who will also help.
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> I agree, Stranger, that we should proceed along the 
<A NAME="1034"></A>road in which God is guiding us; and how we can proceed rightly has now 
<A NAME="1035"></A>to be investigated and explained.
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> O Megillus and Cleinias, about these matters we cannot 
<A NAME="1037"></A>legislate further until the council is constituted; when that is done, 
<A NAME="1038"></A>then we will determine what authority they shall have of their own; but 
<A NAME="1039"></A>the explanation of how this is all to be ordered would only be given rightly 
<A NAME="1040"></A>in a long discourse.
<A NAME="1041"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What do you mean, and what new thing is 
<A NAME="1042"></A>this?
<A NAME="1043"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> In the first place, a list would have to be made out of 
<A NAME="1044"></A>those who by their ages and studies and dispositions and habits are well 
<A NAME="1045"></A>fitted for the duty of a guardian. In the next place, it will not be easy 
<A NAME="1046"></A>for them to discover themselves what they ought to learn, or become the 
<A NAME="1047"></A>disciple of one who has already made the discovery. Furthermore, to write 
<A NAME="1048"></A>down the times at which, and during which, they ought to receive the several 
<A NAME="1049"></A>kinds of instruction, would be a vain thing; for the learners themselves 
<A NAME="1050"></A>do not know what is learned to advantage until the knowledge which is the 
<A NAME="1051"></A>result of learning has found a place in the soul of each. And so these 
<A NAME="1052"></A>details, although they could not be truly said to be secret, might be said 
<A NAME="1053"></A>to be incapable of being stated beforehand, because when stated they would 
<A NAME="1054"></A>have no meaning.
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What then are we to do, Stranger, under these 
<A NAME="1056"></A>circumstances?
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> As the proverb says, the answer is no secret, but open 
<A NAME="1058"></A>to all of us:-We must risk the whole on the chance of throwing, as they 
<A NAME="1059"></A>say, thrice six or thrice ace, and I am willing to share with you the danger 
<A NAME="1060"></A>by stating and explaining to you my views about education and nurture, 
<A NAME="1061"></A>which is the question coming to the surface again. The danger is not a 
<A NAME="1062"></A>slight or ordinary one, and I would advise you, Cleinias, in particular, 
<A NAME="1063"></A>to see to the matter; for if you order rightly the city of the Magnetes, 
<A NAME="1064"></A>or whatever name God may give it, you will obtain the greatest glory; or 
<A NAME="1065"></A>at any rate you will be thought the most courageous of men in the estimation 
<A NAME="1066"></A>of posterity. Dear companions, if this our divine assembly can only be 
<A NAME="1067"></A>established, to them we will hand over the city; none of the present company 
<A NAME="1068"></A>of legislators, as I may call them, would hesitate about that. And the 
<A NAME="1069"></A>state will be perfected and become a waking reality, which a little while 
<A NAME="1070"></A>ago we attempted to create as a dream and in idea only, mingling together 
<A NAME="1071"></A>reason and mind in one image, in the hope that our citizens might be duly 
<A NAME="1072"></A>mingled and rightly educated; and being educated, and dwelling in the citadel 
<A NAME="1073"></A>of the land, might become perfect guardians, such as we have never seen 
<A NAME="1074"></A>in all our previous life, by reason of the saving virtue which is in 
<A NAME="1075"></A>them.
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> Dear Cleinias, after all that has been said, either 
<A NAME="1077"></A>we must detain the Stranger, and by supplications and in all manner of 
<A NAME="1078"></A>ways make him share in the foundation of the city, or we must give up the 
<A NAME="1079"></A>undertaking.
<A NAME="1080"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very true, Megillus; and you must join with me in detaining 
<A NAME="1081"></A>him.
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> I will.
