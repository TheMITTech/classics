</BLOCKQUOTE><HR SIZE="1" COLOR="990033" NOSHADE><BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="17"></A><BR><BR><B>Theodorus.</B> Here we are, Socrates, true to our agreement 
<A NAME="18"></A>of yesterday; and we bring with us a stranger from Elea, who is a disciple 
<A NAME="19"></A>of Parmenides and Zeno, and a true philosopher.
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><BR><B>Socrates.</B> Is he not rather a god, Theodorus, who comes to 
<A NAME="21"></A>us in the disguise of a stranger? For Homer says that all the gods, and 
<A NAME="22"></A>especially the god of strangers, are companions of the meek and just, and 
<A NAME="23"></A>visit the good and evil among men. And may not your companion be one of 
<A NAME="24"></A>those higher powers, a cross-examining deity, who has come to spy out our 
<A NAME="25"></A>weakness in argument, and to cross-examine us?
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR><B>Theod.</B> Nay, Socrates, he is not one of the disputatious 
<A NAME="27"></A>sort-he is too good for that. And, in my opinion, he is not a god at all; 
<A NAME="28"></A>but divine he certainly is, for this is a title which I should give to 
<A NAME="29"></A>all philosophers.
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Capital, my friend! and I may add that they are almost 
<A NAME="31"></A>as hard to be discerned as the gods. For the true philosophers, and such 
<A NAME="32"></A>as are not merely made up for the occasion, appear in various forms unrecognized 
<A NAME="33"></A>by the ignorance of men, and they "hover about cities," as Homer declares, 
<A NAME="34"></A>looking from above upon human life; and some think nothing of them, and 
<A NAME="35"></A>others can never think enough; and sometimes they appear as statesmen, 
<A NAME="36"></A>and sometimes as sophists; and then, again, to many they seem to be no 
<A NAME="37"></A>better than madmen. I should like to ask our Eleatic friend, if he would 
<A NAME="38"></A>tell us, what is thought about them in Italy, and to whom the terms are 
<A NAME="39"></A>applied.
<A NAME="40"></A><BR><BR><B>Theod.</B> What terms?
<A NAME="41"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Sophist, statesman, philosopher.
<A NAME="42"></A><BR><BR><B>Theod.</B> What is your difficulty about them, and what made 
<A NAME="43"></A>you ask?
<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I want to know whether by his countrymen they are regarded 
<A NAME="45"></A>as one or two; or do they, as the names are three, distinguish also three 
<A NAME="46"></A>kinds, and assign one to each name?
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR><B>Theod.</B> I dare say that the Stranger will not object to discuss 
<A NAME="48"></A>the question. What do you say, Stranger?
<A NAME="49"></A><BR><BR><B>Stranger.</B> I am far from objecting, Theodorus, nor have I 
<A NAME="50"></A>any difficulty in replying that by us they are regarded as three. But to 
<A NAME="51"></A>define precisely the nature of each of them is by no means a slight or 
<A NAME="52"></A>easy task.
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR><B>Theod.</B> You have happened to light, Socrates, almost on the 
<A NAME="54"></A>very question which we were asking our friend before we came hither, and 
<A NAME="55"></A>he excused himself to us, as he does now you; although he admitted that 
<A NAME="56"></A>the matter had been fully discussed, and that he remembered the 
<A NAME="57"></A>answer.
<A NAME="58"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then do not, Stranger, deny us the first favour which 
<A NAME="59"></A>we ask of you: I am sure that you will not, and therefore I shall only 
<A NAME="60"></A>beg of you to say whether you like and are accustomed to make a long oration 
<A NAME="61"></A>on a subject which you want to explain to another, or to proceed by the 
<A NAME="62"></A>method of question and answer. I remember hearing a very noble discussion 
<A NAME="63"></A>in which Parmenides employed the latter of the two methods, when I was 
<A NAME="64"></A>a young man, and he was far advanced in years.
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> I prefer to talk with another when he responds pleasantly, 
<A NAME="66"></A>and is light in hand; if not, I would rather have my own 
<A NAME="67"></A>say.
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Any one of the present company will respond kindly 
<A NAME="69"></A>to you, and you can choose whom you like of them; I should recommend you 
<A NAME="70"></A>to take a young person-Theaetetus, for example-unless you have a preference 
<A NAME="71"></A>for some one else.
<A NAME="72"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> I feel ashamed, Socrates, being a new comer into your 
<A NAME="73"></A>society, instead of talking a little and hearing others talk, to be spinning 
<A NAME="74"></A>out a long soliloquy or address, as if I wanted to show off. For the true 
<A NAME="75"></A>answer will certainly be a very long one, a great deal longer than might 
<A NAME="76"></A>be expected from such a short and simple question. At the same time, I 
<A NAME="77"></A>fear that I may seem rude and ungracious if I refuse your courteous request, 
<A NAME="78"></A>especially after what you have said. For I certainly cannot object to your 
<A NAME="79"></A>proposal, that Theaetetus should respond, having already conversed with 
<A NAME="80"></A>him myself, and being recommended by you to take him.
<A NAME="81"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaetetus.</B> But are you sure, Stranger, that this will be 
<A NAME="82"></A>quite so acceptable to the rest of the company as Socrates 
<A NAME="83"></A>imagines?
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> You hear them applauding, Theaetetus; after that, there 
<A NAME="85"></A>is nothing more to be said. Well then, I am to argue with you, and if you 
<A NAME="86"></A>tire of the argument, you may complain of your friends and not of 
<A NAME="87"></A>me.
<A NAME="88"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I do not think that I shall tire, and if I do, I 
<A NAME="89"></A>shall get my friend here, young Socrates, the namesake of the elder Socrates, 
<A NAME="90"></A>to help; he is about my own age, and my partner at the gymnasium, and is 
<A NAME="91"></A>constantly accustomed to work with me.
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Very good; you can decide about that for yourself as 
<A NAME="93"></A>we proceed. Meanwhile you and I will begin together and enquire into the 
<A NAME="94"></A>nature of the Sophist, first of the three: I should like you to make out 
<A NAME="95"></A>what he is and bring him to light in a discussion; for at present we are 
<A NAME="96"></A>only agreed about the name, but of the thing to which we both apply the 
<A NAME="97"></A>name possibly you have one notion and I another; whereas we ought always 
<A NAME="98"></A>to come to an understanding about the thing itself in terms of a definition, 
<A NAME="99"></A>and not merely about the name minus the definition. Now the tribe of Sophists 
<A NAME="100"></A>which we are investigating is not easily caught or defined; and the world 
<A NAME="101"></A>has long ago agreed, that if great subjects are to be adequately treated, 
<A NAME="102"></A>they must be studied in the lesser and easier instances of them before 
<A NAME="103"></A>we proceed to the greatest of all. And as I know that the tribe of Sophists 
<A NAME="104"></A>is troublesome and hard to be caught, I should recommend that we practise 
<A NAME="105"></A>beforehand the method which is to be applied to him on some simple and 
<A NAME="106"></A>smaller thing, unless you can suggest a better way.
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Indeed I cannot.
<A NAME="108"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Then suppose that we work out some lesser example which 
<A NAME="109"></A>will be a pattern of the greater?
<A NAME="110"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Good.
<A NAME="111"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> What is there which is well known and not great, and 
<A NAME="112"></A>is yet as susceptible of definition as any larger thing? Shall I say an 
<A NAME="113"></A>angler? He is familiar to all of us, and not a very interesting or important 
<A NAME="114"></A>person.
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> He is not.
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Yet I suspect that he will furnish us with the sort 
<A NAME="117"></A>of definition and line of enquiry which we want.
<A NAME="118"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Very good.
<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Let us begin by asking whether he is a man having art 
<A NAME="120"></A>or not having art, but some other power.
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> He is clearly a man of art.
<A NAME="122"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And of arts there are two kinds?
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> What are they?
<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> There is agriculture, and the tending of mortal creatures, 
<A NAME="125"></A>and the art of constructing or moulding vessels, and there is the art of 
<A NAME="126"></A>imitation-all these may be appropriately called by a single 
<A NAME="127"></A>name.
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> What do you mean? And what is the 
<A NAME="129"></A>name?
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> He who brings into existence something that did not 
<A NAME="131"></A>exist before is said to be a producer, and that which is brought into existence 
<A NAME="132"></A>is said to be produced.
<A NAME="133"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> True.
<A NAME="134"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And all the arts which were just now mentioned are 
<A NAME="135"></A>characterized by this power of producing?
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> They are.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Then let us sum them up under the name of productive 
<A NAME="138"></A>or creative art.
<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Very good.
<A NAME="140"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Next follows the whole class of learning and cognition; 
<A NAME="141"></A>then comes trade, fighting, hunting. And since none of these produces anything, 
<A NAME="142"></A>but is only engaged in conquering by word or deed, or in preventing others 
<A NAME="143"></A>from conquering, things which exist and have been already produced-in each 
<A NAME="144"></A>and all of these branches there appears to be an art which may be called 
<A NAME="145"></A>acquisitive.
<A NAME="146"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes, that is the proper name.
<A NAME="147"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Seeing, then, that all arts are either acquisitive 
<A NAME="148"></A>or creative, in which class shall we place the art of the 
<A NAME="149"></A>angler?
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Clearly in the acquisitive class.
<A NAME="151"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And the acquisitive may be subdivided into two parts: 
<A NAME="152"></A>there is exchange, which is voluntary and is effected by gifts, hire, purchase; 
<A NAME="153"></A>and the other part of acquisitive, which takes by force of word or deed, 
<A NAME="154"></A>may be termed conquest?
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> That is implied in what has been 
<A NAME="156"></A>said.
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And may not conquest be again subdivided?
<A NAME="158"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> How?
<A NAME="159"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Open force may; be called fighting, and secret force 
<A NAME="160"></A>may have the general name of hunting?
<A NAME="161"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And there is no reason why the art of hunting should 
<A NAME="163"></A>not be further divided.
<A NAME="164"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> How would you make the division?
<A NAME="165"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Into the hunting of living and of lifeless 
<A NAME="166"></A>prey.
<A NAME="167"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes, if both kinds exist.
<A NAME="168"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Of course they exist; but the hunting after lifeless 
<A NAME="169"></A>things having no special name, except some sorts of diving, and other small 
<A NAME="170"></A>matters, may be omitted; the hunting after living things may be called 
<A NAME="171"></A>animal hunting.
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="173"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And animal hunting may be truly said to have two divisions, 
<A NAME="174"></A>land-animal hunting, which has many kinds and names, and water-animals 
<A NAME="175"></A>hunting, or the hunting after animals who swim?
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> True.
<A NAME="177"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And of swimming animals, one class lives on the wing 
<A NAME="178"></A>and the other in the water?
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="180"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Fowling is the general term under which the hunting 
<A NAME="181"></A>of all birds is included.
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> True.
<A NAME="183"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> The hunting of animals who live in the water has the 
<A NAME="184"></A>general name of fishing.
<A NAME="185"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="186"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And this sort of hunting may be further divided also 
<A NAME="187"></A>into two principal kinds?
<A NAME="188"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> What are they?
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> There is one kind which takes them in nets, another 
<A NAME="190"></A>which takes them by a blow.
<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> What do you mean, and how do you distinguish 
<A NAME="192"></A>them?
<A NAME="193"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> As to the first kind-all that surrounds and encloses 
<A NAME="194"></A>anything to prevent egress, may be rightly called an 
<A NAME="195"></A>enclosure.
<A NAME="196"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> For which reason twig baskets, casting nets, nooses, 
<A NAME="198"></A>creels, and the like may all be termed "enclosures"?
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> True.
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And therefore this first kind of capture may be called 
<A NAME="201"></A>by us capture with enclosures, or something of that 
<A NAME="202"></A>sort?
<A NAME="203"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="204"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> The other kind, which is practised by a blow with hooks 
<A NAME="205"></A>and three pronged spears, when summed up under one name, may be called 
<A NAME="206"></A>striking, unless you, Theaetetus, can find some better 
<A NAME="207"></A>name?
<A NAME="208"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Never mind the name-what you suggest will do very 
<A NAME="209"></A>well.
<A NAME="210"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> There is one mode of striking, which is done at night, 
<A NAME="211"></A>and by the light of a fire, and is by the hunters themselves called firing, 
<A NAME="212"></A>or spearing by firelight.
<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> True.
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And the fishing by day is called by the general name 
<A NAME="215"></A>of barbing because the spears, too, are barbed at the 
<A NAME="216"></A>point.
<A NAME="217"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes, that is the term.
<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Of this barb-fishing, that which strikes the fish Who 
<A NAME="219"></A>is below from above is called spearing, because this is the way in which 
<A NAME="220"></A>the three-pronged spears are mostly used.
<A NAME="221"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes, it is often called so.
<A NAME="222"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Then now there is only one kind 
<A NAME="223"></A>remaining.
<A NAME="224"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> What is that?
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> When a hook is used, and the fish is not struck in 
<A NAME="226"></A>any chance part of his body-he as be is with the spear, but only about 
<A NAME="227"></A>the head and mouth, and is then drawn out from below upwards with reeds 
<A NAME="228"></A>and rods:-What is the right name of that mode of fish, 
<A NAME="229"></A>Theaetetus?
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I suspect that we have now discovered the object 
<A NAME="231"></A>of our search.
<A NAME="232"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Then now you and I have come to an understanding not 
<A NAME="233"></A>only about the name of the angler's art, but about the definition of the 
<A NAME="234"></A>thing itself. One half of all art was acquisitive-half of all the art acquisitive 
<A NAME="235"></A>art was conquest or taking by force, half of this was hunting, and half 
<A NAME="236"></A>of hunting was hunting animals, half of this was hunting water animals-of 
<A NAME="237"></A>this again, the under half was fishing, half of fishing was striking; a 
<A NAME="238"></A>part of striking was fishing with a barb, and one half of this again, being 
<A NAME="239"></A>the kind which strikes with a hook and draws the fish from below upwards, 
<A NAME="240"></A>is the art which we have been seeking, and which from the nature of the 
<A NAME="241"></A>operation is denoted angling or drawing up (aspalienutike, 
<A NAME="242"></A>anaspasthai).
<A NAME="243"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> The result has been quite satisfactorily brought 
<A NAME="244"></A>out.
<A NAME="245"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And now, following this pattern, let us endeavour to 
<A NAME="246"></A>find out what a Sophist is.
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> By all means.
<A NAME="248"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> The first question about the angler was, whether he 
<A NAME="249"></A>was a skilled artist or unskilled?
<A NAME="250"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> True.
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And shall we call our new friend unskilled, or a thorough 
<A NAME="252"></A>master of his craft?
<A NAME="253"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly not unskilled, for his name, as, indeed, 
<A NAME="254"></A>you imply, must surely express his nature.
<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Then he must be supposed to have some 
<A NAME="256"></A>art.
<A NAME="257"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> What art?
<A NAME="258"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> By heaven, they are cousins! it never occurred to 
<A NAME="259"></A>us.
<A NAME="260"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Who are cousins?
<A NAME="261"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> The angler and the Sophist.
<A NAME="262"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> In what way are they related?
<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> They both appear to me to be hunters.
<A NAME="264"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> How the Sophist? Of the other we have 
<A NAME="265"></A>spoken.
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> You remember our division of hunting, into hunting 
<A NAME="267"></A>after swimming animals and land animals?
<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="269"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And you remember that we subdivided the swimming and 
<A NAME="270"></A>left the land animals, saying that there were many kinds of 
<A NAME="271"></A>them?
<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="273"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Thus far, then, the Sophist and the angler, starting 
<A NAME="274"></A>from the art of acquiring, take the same road?
<A NAME="275"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> So it would appear.
<A NAME="276"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Their paths diverge when they reach the art of animal 
<A NAME="277"></A>hunting; the one going to the seashore, and to the rivers and to the lakes, 
<A NAME="278"></A>and angling for the animals which are in them.
<A NAME="279"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="280"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> While the other goes to land and water of another sort-rivers 
<A NAME="281"></A>of wealth and broad meadow-lands of generous youth; and he also is intending 
<A NAME="282"></A>to take the animals which are in them.
<A NAME="283"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> What do you mean?
<A NAME="284"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Of hunting on land there are two principal 
<A NAME="285"></A>divisions.
<A NAME="286"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> What are they?
<A NAME="287"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> One is the hunting of tame, and the other of wild 
<A NAME="288"></A>animals.
<A NAME="289"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> But are tame animals ever hunted?
<A NAME="290"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Yes, if you include man under tame animals. But if 
<A NAME="291"></A>you like you may say that there are no tame animals, or that, if there 
<A NAME="292"></A>are, man is not among them; or you may say that man is a tame animal but 
<A NAME="293"></A>is not hunted-you shall decide which of these alternatives you 
<A NAME="294"></A>prefer.
<A NAME="295"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I should say, Stranger, that man is a tame animal, 
<A NAME="296"></A>and I admit that he is hunted.
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Then let us divide the hunting of tame animals into 
<A NAME="298"></A>two parts.
<A NAME="299"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> How shall we make the division?
<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Let us define piracy, man-stealing, tyranny, the whole 
<A NAME="301"></A>military art, by one name, as hunting with violence.
<A NAME="302"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Very good.
<A NAME="303"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> But the art of the lawyer, of the popular orator, and 
<A NAME="304"></A>the art of conversation may be called in one word the art of 
<A NAME="305"></A>persuasion.
<A NAME="306"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> True.
<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And of persuasion, there may be said to be two 
<A NAME="308"></A>kinds?
<A NAME="309"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> What are they?
<A NAME="310"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> One is private, and the other public.
<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes; each of them forms a class.
<A NAME="312"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And of private hunting, one sort receives hire, and 
<A NAME="313"></A>the other brings gifts.
<A NAME="314"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I do not understand you.
<A NAME="315"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> You seem never to have observed the manner in which 
<A NAME="316"></A>lovers hunt.
<A NAME="317"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> To what do you refer?
<A NAME="318"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> I mean that they lavish gifts on those whom they hunt 
<A NAME="319"></A>in addition to other inducements.
<A NAME="320"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Most true.
<A NAME="321"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Let us admit this, then, to be the amatory 
<A NAME="322"></A>art.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="324"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> But that sort of hireling whose conversation is pleasing 
<A NAME="325"></A>and who baits his hook only with pleasure and exacts nothing but his maintenance 
<A NAME="326"></A>in return, we should all, if I am not mistaken, describe as possessing 
<A NAME="327"></A>flattery or an art of making things pleasant.
<A NAME="328"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="329"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And that sort, which professes to form acquaintances 
<A NAME="330"></A>only for the sake of virtue, and demands a reward in the shape of money, 
<A NAME="331"></A>may be fairly called by another name?
<A NAME="332"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> To be sure.
<A NAME="333"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And what is the name? Will you tell 
<A NAME="334"></A>me?
<A NAME="335"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> It is obvious enough; for I believe that we have 
<A NAME="336"></A>discovered the Sophist: which is, as I conceive, the proper name for the 
<A NAME="337"></A>class described.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Then now, Theaetetus, his art may be traced as a branch 
<A NAME="339"></A>of the appropriative, acquisitive family-which hunts animals,-living-land-tame 
<A NAME="340"></A>animals; which hunts man,-privately-for hire,-taking money in exchange-having 
<A NAME="341"></A>the semblance of education; and this is termed Sophistry, and is a hunt 
<A NAME="342"></A>after young men of wealth and rank-such is the conclusion.
<A NAME="343"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Just so.
<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Let us take another branch of his genealogy; for he 
<A NAME="345"></A>is a professor of a great and many sided art; and if we look back at what 
<A NAME="346"></A>has preceded we see that he presents another aspect, besides that of which 
<A NAME="347"></A>we are speaking.
<A NAME="348"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> In what respect?
<A NAME="349"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> There were two sorts of acquisitive art; the one concerned 
<A NAME="350"></A>with hunting, the other with exchange.
<A NAME="351"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> There were.
<A NAME="352"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And of the art of exchange there are two divisions, 
<A NAME="353"></A>the one of giving, and the other of selling.
<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Let us assume that.
<A NAME="355"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Next, will suppose the art of selling to be divided 
<A NAME="356"></A>into two parts.
<A NAME="357"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> How?
<A NAME="358"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> There is one part which is distinguished as the sale 
<A NAME="359"></A>of a man's own productions; another, which is the exchange of the works 
<A NAME="360"></A>of others.
<A NAME="361"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And is not that part of exchange which takes place 
<A NAME="363"></A>in the city, being about half of the whole, termed retailing?
<A NAME="364"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="365"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And that which exchanges the goods of one city for 
<A NAME="366"></A>those of another by selling and buying is the exchange of the 
<A NAME="367"></A>merchant?
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> To be sure.
<A NAME="369"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And you are aware that this exchange of the merchant 
<A NAME="370"></A>is of two kinds: it is partly concerned with food for the use of the body, 
<A NAME="371"></A>and partly with the food of the soul which is bartered and received in 
<A NAME="372"></A>exchange for money.
<A NAME="373"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> What do you mean?
<A NAME="374"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> You want to know what is the meaning of food for the 
<A NAME="375"></A>soul; the other kind you surely understand.
<A NAME="376"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="377"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Take music in general and painting and marionette playing 
<A NAME="378"></A>and many other things, which are purchased in one city, and carried away 
<A NAME="379"></A>and sold in another-wares of the soul which are hawked about either for 
<A NAME="380"></A>the sake of instruction or amusement;-may not he who takes them about and 
<A NAME="381"></A>sells them be quite as truly called a merchant as he who sells meats and 
<A NAME="382"></A>drinks?
<A NAME="383"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> To be sure he may.
<A NAME="384"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And would you not call by the same name him who buys 
<A NAME="385"></A>up knowledge and goes about from city to city exchanging his wares for 
<A NAME="386"></A>money?
<A NAME="387"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly I should.
<A NAME="388"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Of this merchandise of the soul, may not one part be 
<A NAME="389"></A>fairly termed the art of display? And there is another part which is certainly 
<A NAME="390"></A>not less ridiculous, but being a trade in learning must be called by some 
<A NAME="391"></A>name germane to the matter?
<A NAME="392"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="393"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> The latter should have two names,-one descriptive of 
<A NAME="394"></A>the sale of the knowledge of virtue, and the other of the sale of other 
<A NAME="395"></A>kinds of knowledge.
<A NAME="396"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Of course.
<A NAME="397"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> The name of art-seller corresponds well enough to the 
<A NAME="398"></A>latter; but you must try and tell me the name of the 
<A NAME="399"></A>other.
<A NAME="400"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> He must be the Sophist, whom we are seeking; no 
<A NAME="401"></A>other name can possibly be right.
<A NAME="402"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> No other; and so this trader in virtue again turns 
<A NAME="403"></A>out to be our friend the Sophist, whose art may now be traced from the 
<A NAME="404"></A>art of acquisition through exchange, trade, merchandise, to a merchandise 
<A NAME="405"></A>of the soul which is concerned with speech and the knowledge of 
<A NAME="406"></A>virtue.
<A NAME="407"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Quite true.
<A NAME="408"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And there may be a third reappearance of him;-for he 
<A NAME="409"></A>may have settled down in a city, and may fabricate as well as buy these 
<A NAME="410"></A>same wares, intending to live by selling them, and he would still be called 
<A NAME="411"></A>a Sophist?
<A NAME="412"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="413"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Then that part of acquisitive art which exchanges, 
<A NAME="414"></A>and of exchange which either sells a man's own productions or retails those 
<A NAME="415"></A>of others; as the case may be, and in either way sells the knowledge of 
<A NAME="416"></A>virtue, you would again term Sophistry?
<A NAME="417"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I must, if I am to keep pace with the 
<A NAME="418"></A>argument.
<A NAME="419"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Let us consider once more whether there may not be 
<A NAME="420"></A>yet another aspect of sophistry.
<A NAME="421"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> What is it?
<A NAME="422"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> In the acquisitive there was a subdivision of the combative 
<A NAME="423"></A>or fighting art.
<A NAME="424"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> There was.
<A NAME="425"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Perhaps we had better divide it.
<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> What shall be the divisions?
<A NAME="427"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> There shall be one division of the competitive, and 
<A NAME="428"></A>another of the pugnacious.
<A NAME="429"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Very good.
<A NAME="430"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> That part of the pugnacious which is contest of bodily 
<A NAME="431"></A>strength may be properly called by some such name as 
<A NAME="432"></A>violent.
<A NAME="433"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> True.
<A NAME="434"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And when the war is one of words, it may be termed 
<A NAME="435"></A>controversy?
<A NAME="436"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="437"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And controversy may be of two kinds.
<A NAME="438"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> What are they?
<A NAME="439"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> When long speeches are answered by long speeches, and 
<A NAME="440"></A>there is public discussion about the just and unjust, that is forensic 
<A NAME="441"></A>controversy.
<A NAME="442"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And there is a private sort of controversy, which is 
<A NAME="444"></A>cut up into questions and answers, and this is commonly called 
<A NAME="445"></A>disputation?
<A NAME="446"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes, that is the name.
<A NAME="447"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And of disputation, that sort which is only a discussion 
<A NAME="448"></A>about contracts, and is carried on at random, and without rules-art, is 
<A NAME="449"></A>recognized by the reasoning faculty to be a distinct class, but has hitherto 
<A NAME="450"></A>had no distinctive name, and does not deserve to receive one from 
<A NAME="451"></A>us.
<A NAME="452"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> No; for the different sorts of it are too minute 
<A NAME="453"></A>and heterogeneous.
<A NAME="454"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> But that which proceeds by rules of art to dispute 
<A NAME="455"></A>about justice and injustice in their own nature, and about things in general, 
<A NAME="456"></A>we have been accustomed to call argumentation (Eristic)?
<A NAME="457"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="458"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And of argumentation, one sort wastes money, and the 
<A NAME="459"></A>other makes money.
<A NAME="460"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="461"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Suppose we try and give to each of these two classes 
<A NAME="462"></A>a name.
<A NAME="463"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Let us do so.
<A NAME="464"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> I should say that the habit which leads a man to neglect 
<A NAME="465"></A>his own affairs for the pleasure of conversation, of which the style is 
<A NAME="466"></A>far from being agreeable to the majority of his hearers, may be fairly 
<A NAME="467"></A>termed loquacity: such is my opinion.
<A NAME="468"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> That is the common name for it.
<A NAME="469"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> But now who the other is, who makes money out of private 
<A NAME="470"></A>disputation, it is your turn to say.
<A NAME="471"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> There is only one true answer: he is the wonderful 
<A NAME="472"></A>Sophist, of whom we are in pursuit, and who reappears again for the fourth 
<A NAME="473"></A>time.
<A NAME="474"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Yes, and with a fresh pedigree, for he is the money-making 
<A NAME="475"></A>species of the Eristic, disputatious, controversial. pugnacious, combative, 
<A NAME="476"></A>acquisitive family, as the argument has already proven.
<A NAME="477"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="478"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> How true was the observation that he was a many-sided 
<A NAME="479"></A>animal, and not to be caught with one hand, as they 
<A NAME="480"></A>say!
<A NAME="481"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Then you must catch him with 
<A NAME="482"></A>two.
<A NAME="483"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Yes, we must, if we can. And therefore let us try, 
<A NAME="484"></A>another track in our pursuit of him: You are aware that there are certain 
<A NAME="485"></A>menial occupations which have names among servants?
<A NAME="486"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes, there are many such; which of them do you 
<A NAME="487"></A>mean?
<A NAME="488"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> I mean such as sifting, straining, winnowing, 
<A NAME="489"></A>threshing.
<A NAME="490"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="491"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And besides these there are a great many more, such 
<A NAME="492"></A>as carding, spinning, adjusting the warp and the woof; and thousands of 
<A NAME="493"></A>similar expressions are used in the arts.
<A NAME="494"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Of what are they to be patterns, and what are we 
<A NAME="495"></A>going to do with them all?
<A NAME="496"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> I think that in all of these there is implied a notion 
<A NAME="497"></A>of division.
<A NAME="498"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="499"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Then if, as I was saying, there is one art which includes 
<A NAME="500"></A>all of them, ought not that art to have one name?
<A NAME="501"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaes.</B> And what is the name of the art?
<A NAME="502"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> The art of discerning or discriminating.
<A NAME="503"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Very good.
<A NAME="504"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Think whether you cannot divide 
<A NAME="505"></A>this.
<A NAME="506"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I should have to think a long 
<A NAME="507"></A>while.
<A NAME="508"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> In all the previously named processes either like has 
<A NAME="509"></A>been separated from like or the better from the worse.
<A NAME="510"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I see now what you mean.
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>Str, There is no name for the first kind of separation; of the second, 
<A NAME="512"></A>which throws away the worse and preserves the better, I do know a 
<A NAME="513"></A>name.
<A NAME="514"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> What is it?
<A NAME="515"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Every discernment or discrimination of that kind, as 
<A NAME="516"></A>I have observed, is called a purification.
<A NAME="517"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes, that is the usual expression.
<A NAME="518"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And any one may see that purification is of two 
<A NAME="519"></A>kinds.
<A NAME="520"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Perhaps so, if he were allowed time to think; but 
<A NAME="521"></A>I do not see at this moment.
<A NAME="522"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> There are many purifications of bodies which may with 
<A NAME="523"></A>propriety be comprehended under a single name.
<A NAME="524"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> What are they, and what is their 
<A NAME="525"></A>name?
<A NAME="526"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> There is the purification of living bodies in their 
<A NAME="527"></A>inward and in their outward parts, of which the former is duly effected 
<A NAME="528"></A>by medicine and gymnastic, the latter by the not very dignified art of 
<A NAME="529"></A>the bath-man; and there is the purification of inanimate substances-to 
<A NAME="530"></A>this the arts of fulling and of furbishing in general attend in a number 
<A NAME="531"></A>of minute particulars, having a variety of names which are thought 
<A NAME="532"></A>ridiculous.
<A NAME="533"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="534"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> There can be no doubt that they are thought ridiculous, 
<A NAME="535"></A>Theaetetus; but then the dialectical art never considers whether the benefit 
<A NAME="536"></A>to be derived from the purge is greater or less than that to be derived 
<A NAME="537"></A>from the sponge, and has not more interest in the one than in the other; 
<A NAME="538"></A>her endeavour is to know what is and is not kindred in all arts, with a 
<A NAME="539"></A>view to the acquisition of intelligence; and having this in view, she honours 
<A NAME="540"></A>them all alike, and when she makes comparisons, she counts one of them 
<A NAME="541"></A>not a whit more ridiculous than another; nor does she esteem him who adduces 
<A NAME="542"></A>as his example of hunting, the general's art, at all more decorous than 
<A NAME="543"></A>another who cites that of the vermin-destroyer, but only as the greater 
<A NAME="544"></A>pretender of the two. And as to your question concerning the name which 
<A NAME="545"></A>was to comprehend all these arts of purification, whether of animate or 
<A NAME="546"></A>inanimate bodies, the art of dialectic is in no wise particular about fine 
<A NAME="547"></A>words, if she maybe only allowed to have a general name for all other purifications, 
<A NAME="548"></A>binding them up together and separating them off from the purification 
<A NAME="549"></A>of the soul or intellect. For this is the purification at which she wants 
<A NAME="550"></A>to arrive, and this we should understand to be her aim.
<A NAME="551"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes, I understand; and I agree that there are two 
<A NAME="552"></A>sorts of purification and that one of them is concerned with the soul, 
<A NAME="553"></A>and that there is another which is concerned with the 
<A NAME="554"></A>body.
<A NAME="555"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Excellent; and now listen to what I am going to say, 
<A NAME="556"></A>and try to divide further the first of the two.
<A NAME="557"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Whatever line of division you suggest, I will endeavour 
<A NAME="558"></A>to assist you.
<A NAME="559"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Do we admit that virtue is distinct from vice in the 
<A NAME="560"></A>soul?
<A NAME="561"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="562"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And purification was to leave the good and to cast 
<A NAME="563"></A>out whatever is bad?
<A NAME="564"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> True.
<A NAME="565"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Then any taking away of evil from the soul may be properly 
<A NAME="566"></A>called purification?
<A NAME="567"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="568"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And in the soul there are two kinds of 
<A NAME="569"></A>evil.
<A NAME="570"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> What are they?
<A NAME="571"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> The one may be compared to disease in the body, the 
<A NAME="572"></A>other to deformity.
<A NAME="573"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I do not understand.
<A NAME="574"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Perhaps you have never reflected that disease and discord 
<A NAME="575"></A>are the same.
<A NAME="576"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> To this, again, I know not what I should 
<A NAME="577"></A>reply.
<A NAME="578"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Do you not conceive discord to be a dissolution of 
<A NAME="579"></A>kindred clements, originating in some disagreement?
<A NAME="580"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Just that.
<A NAME="581"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And is deformity anything but the want of measure, 
<A NAME="582"></A>which is always unsightly?
<A NAME="583"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Exactly.
<A NAME="584"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And do we not see that opinion is opposed to desire, 
<A NAME="585"></A>pleasure to anger, reason to pain, and that all these elements are opposed 
<A NAME="586"></A>to one another in the souls of bad men?
<A NAME="587"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="588"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And yet they must all be akin?
<A NAME="589"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Of course.
<A NAME="590"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Then we shall be right in calling vice a discord and 
<A NAME="591"></A>disease of the soul?
<A NAME="592"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Most true.
<A NAME="593"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And when things having motion, an aiming at an appointed 
<A NAME="594"></A>mark, continually miss their aim and glance aside, shall we say that this 
<A NAME="595"></A>is the effect of symmetry among them, or of the want of 
<A NAME="596"></A>symmetry?
<A NAME="597"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Clearly of the want of symmetry.
<A NAME="598"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> But surely we know that no soul is voluntarily ignorant 
<A NAME="599"></A>of anything?
<A NAME="600"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly not.
<A NAME="601"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And what is ignorance but the aberration of a mind 
<A NAME="602"></A>which is bent on truth, and in which the process of understanding is 
<A NAME="603"></A>perverted?
<A NAME="604"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> True.
<A NAME="605"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Then we are to regard an unintelligent soul as deformed 
<A NAME="606"></A>and devoid of symmetry?
<A NAME="607"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="608"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Then there are these two kinds of evil in the soul-the 
<A NAME="609"></A>one which is generally called vice, and is obviously a disease of the 
<A NAME="610"></A>soul...
<A NAME="611"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="612"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And there is the other, which they call ignorance, 
<A NAME="613"></A>and which, because existing only in the soul, they will not allow to be 
<A NAME="614"></A>vice.
<A NAME="615"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I certainly admit what I at first disputed-that 
<A NAME="616"></A>there are two kinds of vice in the soul, and that we ought to consider 
<A NAME="617"></A>cowardice, intemperance, and injustice to be alike forms of disease in 
<A NAME="618"></A>the soul, and ignorance, of which there are all sorts of varieties, to 
<A NAME="619"></A>be deformity.
<A NAME="620"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And in the case of the body are there not two arts, 
<A NAME="621"></A>which have to do with the two bodily states?
<A NAME="622"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> What are they?
<A NAME="623"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> There is gymnastic, which has to do with deformity, 
<A NAME="624"></A>and medicine, which has to do with disease.
<A NAME="625"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> True.
<A NAME="626"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And where there is insolence and injustice and cowardice, 
<A NAME="627"></A>is not chastisement the art which is most required?
<A NAME="628"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> That certainly appears to be the opinion of 
<A NAME="629"></A>mankind.
<A NAME="630"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Again, of the various kinds of ignorance, may not instruction 
<A NAME="631"></A>be rightly said to be the remedy?
<A NAME="632"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> True.
<A NAME="633"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And of the art of instruction, shall we say that there 
<A NAME="634"></A>is one or many kinds? At any rate there are two principal ones. 
<A NAME="635"></A>Think.
<A NAME="636"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I will.
<A NAME="637"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> I believe that I can see how we shall soonest arrive 
<A NAME="638"></A>at the answer to this question.
<A NAME="639"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> How?
<A NAME="640"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> If we can discover a line which divides ignorance into 
<A NAME="641"></A>two halves. For a division of ignorance into two parts will certainly imply 
<A NAME="642"></A>that the art of instruction is also twofold, answering to the two divisions 
<A NAME="643"></A>of ignorance.
<A NAME="644"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Well, and do you see what you are looking 
<A NAME="645"></A>for?
<A NAME="646"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> I do seem to myself to see one very large and bad sort 
<A NAME="647"></A>of ignorance which is quite separate, and may be weighed in the scale against 
<A NAME="648"></A>all other sorts of ignorance put together.
<A NAME="649"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> What is it?
<A NAME="650"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> When a person supposes that he knows, and does not 
<A NAME="651"></A>know this appears to be the great source of all the errors of the 
<A NAME="652"></A>intellect.
<A NAME="653"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> True.
<A NAME="654"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And this, if I am not mistaken, is the kind of ignorance 
<A NAME="655"></A>which specially earns the title of stupidity.
<A NAME="656"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> True.
<A NAME="657"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> What name, then, shall be given to the sort of instruction 
<A NAME="658"></A>which gets rid of this?
<A NAME="659"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> The instruction which you mean, Stranger, is, I 
<A NAME="660"></A>should imagine, not the teaching of handicraft arts, but what, thanks to 
<A NAME="661"></A>us, has been termed education in this part the world.
<A NAME="662"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Yes, Theaetetus, and by nearly all Hellenes. But we 
<A NAME="663"></A>have still to consider whether education admits of any further 
<A NAME="664"></A>division.
<A NAME="665"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> We have.
<A NAME="666"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> I think that there is a point at which such a division 
<A NAME="667"></A>is possible.
<A NAME="668"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Where?
<A NAME="669"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Of education, one method appears to be rougher, and 
<A NAME="670"></A>another smoother.
<A NAME="671"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> How are we to distinguish the 
<A NAME="672"></A>two?
<A NAME="673"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> There is the time-honoured mode which our fathers commonly 
<A NAME="674"></A>practised towards their sons, and which is still adopted by many-either 
<A NAME="675"></A>of roughly reproving their errors, or of gently advising them; which varieties 
<A NAME="676"></A>may be correctly included under the general term of 
<A NAME="677"></A>admonition.
<A NAME="678"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> True.
<A NAME="679"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> But whereas some appear to have arrived at the conclusion 
<A NAME="680"></A>that all ignorance is involuntary, and that no one who thinks himself wise 
<A NAME="681"></A>is willing to learn any of those things in which he is conscious of his 
<A NAME="682"></A>own cleverness, and that the admonitory sort of instruction gives much 
<A NAME="683"></A>trouble and does little good-
<A NAME="684"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> There they are quite right.
<A NAME="685"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Accordingly, they set to work to eradicate the spirit 
<A NAME="686"></A>of conceit in another way.
<A NAME="687"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> In what way?
<A NAME="688"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> They cross-examine a man's words, when he thinks that 
<A NAME="689"></A>he is saying something and is really saying nothing, and easily convict 
<A NAME="690"></A>him of inconsistencies in his opinions; these they then collect by the 
<A NAME="691"></A>dialectical process, and placing them side by side, show that they contradict 
<A NAME="692"></A>one another about the same things, in relation to the same things, and 
<A NAME="693"></A>in the same respect. He, seeing this, is angry with himself, and grows 
<A NAME="694"></A>gentle towards others, and thus is entirely delivered from great prejudices 
<A NAME="695"></A>and harsh notions, in a way which is most amusing to the hearer, and produces 
<A NAME="696"></A>the most lasting good effect on the person who is the subject of the operation. 
<A NAME="697"></A>For as the physician considers that the body will receive no benefit from 
<A NAME="698"></A>taking food until the internal obstacles have been removed, so the purifier 
<A NAME="699"></A>of the soul is conscious that his patient will receive no benefit from 
<A NAME="700"></A>the application of knowledge until he is refuted, and from refutation learns 
<A NAME="701"></A>modesty; he must be purged of his prejudices first and made to think that 
<A NAME="702"></A>he knows only what he knows, and no more.
<A NAME="703"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> That is certainly the best and wisest state of 
<A NAME="704"></A>mind.
<A NAME="705"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> For all these reasons, Theaetetus, we must admit that 
<A NAME="706"></A>refutation is the greatest and chiefest of purifications, and he who has 
<A NAME="707"></A>not been refuted, though he be the Great King himself, is in an awful state 
<A NAME="708"></A>of impurity; he is uninstructed and deformed in those things in which he 
<A NAME="709"></A>who would be truly blessed ought to be fairest and purest.
<A NAME="710"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="711"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And who are the ministers of this art? I am afraid 
<A NAME="712"></A>to say the Sophists.
<A NAME="713"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Why?
<A NAME="714"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Lest we should assign to them too high a 
<A NAME="715"></A>prerogative.
<A NAME="716"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yet the Sophist has a certain likeness to our minister 
<A NAME="717"></A>of purification.
<A NAME="718"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Yes, the same sort of likeness which a wolf, who is 
<A NAME="719"></A>the fiercest of animals, has to a dog, who is the gentlest. But he who 
<A NAME="720"></A>would not be found tripping, ought to be very careful in this matter of 
<A NAME="721"></A>comparisons, for they are most slippery things. Nevertheless, let us assume 
<A NAME="722"></A>that the Sophists are the men. I say this provisionally, for I think that 
<A NAME="723"></A>the line which divides them will be marked enough if proper care is 
<A NAME="724"></A>taken.
<A NAME="725"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Likely enough.
<A NAME="726"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Let us grant, then, that from the discerning art comes 
<A NAME="727"></A>purification, and from purification let there be separated off a part which 
<A NAME="728"></A>is concerned with the soul; of this mental purification instruction is 
<A NAME="729"></A>a portion, and of instruction education, and of education, that refutation 
<A NAME="730"></A>of vain conceit which has been discovered in the present argument; and 
<A NAME="731"></A>let this be called by you and me the nobly-descended art of 
<A NAME="732"></A>Sophistry.
<A NAME="733"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Very well; and yet, considering the number of forms 
<A NAME="734"></A>in which he has presented himself, I begin to doubt how I can with any 
<A NAME="735"></A>truth or confidence describe the real nature of the 
<A NAME="736"></A>Sophist.
<A NAME="737"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> You naturally feel perplexed; and yet I think that 
<A NAME="738"></A>he must be still more perplexed in his attempt to escape us, for as the 
<A NAME="739"></A>proverb says, when every way is blocked, there is no escape; now, then, 
<A NAME="740"></A>is the time of all others to set upon him.
<A NAME="741"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> True.
<A NAME="742"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> First let us wait a moment and recover breath, and 
<A NAME="743"></A>while we are resting, we may reckon up in how many forms he has appeared. 
<A NAME="744"></A>In the first place, he was discovered to be a paid hunter after wealth 
<A NAME="745"></A>and youth.
<A NAME="746"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="747"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> In the second place, he was a merchant in the goods 
<A NAME="748"></A>of the soul.
<A NAME="749"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="750"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> In the third place, he has turned out to be a retailer 
<A NAME="751"></A>of the same sort of wares.
<A NAME="752"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes; and in the fourth place, he himself manufactured 
<A NAME="753"></A>the learned wares which he sold.
<A NAME="754"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Quite right; I will try and remember the fifth myself. 
<A NAME="755"></A>He belonged to the fighting class, and was further distinguished as a hero 
<A NAME="756"></A>of debate, who professed the eristic art.
<A NAME="757"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> True.
<A NAME="758"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> The sixth point was doubtful, and yet we at last agreed 
<A NAME="759"></A>that he was a purger of souls, who cleared away notions obstructive to 
<A NAME="760"></A>knowledge.
<A NAME="761"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="762"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Do you not see that when the professor of any art has 
<A NAME="763"></A>one name and many kinds of knowledge, there must be something wrong? The 
<A NAME="764"></A>multiplicity of names which is applied to him shows that the common principle 
<A NAME="765"></A>to which all these branches of knowledge are tending, is not 
<A NAME="766"></A>understood.
<A NAME="767"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I should imagine this to be the 
<A NAME="768"></A>case.
<A NAME="769"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> At any rate we will understand him, and no indolence 
<A NAME="770"></A>shall prevent us. Let us begin again, then, and re-examine some of our 
<A NAME="771"></A>statements concerning the Sophist; there was one thing which appeared to 
<A NAME="772"></A>me especially characteristic of him.
<A NAME="773"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> To what are you referring?
<A NAME="774"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> We were saying of him, if I am not mistaken, that he 
<A NAME="775"></A>was a disputer?
<A NAME="776"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> We were.
<A NAME="777"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And does he not also teach others the art of 
<A NAME="778"></A>disputation?
<A NAME="779"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly he does.
<A NAME="780"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And about what does he profess that he teaches men 
<A NAME="781"></A>to dispute? To begin at the beginning-Does he make them able to dispute 
<A NAME="782"></A>about divine things, which are invisible to men in general?
<A NAME="783"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> At any rate, he is said to do 
<A NAME="784"></A>so.
<A NAME="785"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And what do you say of the visible things in heaven 
<A NAME="786"></A>and earth, and the like?
<A NAME="787"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly he disputes, and teaches to dispute about 
<A NAME="788"></A>them.
<A NAME="789"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Then, again, in private conversation, when any universal 
<A NAME="790"></A>assertion is made about generation and essence, we know that such persons 
<A NAME="791"></A>are tremendous argufiers, and are able to impart their own skill to 
<A NAME="792"></A>others.
<A NAME="793"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Undoubtedly.
<A NAME="794"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And do they not profess to make men able to dispute 
<A NAME="795"></A>about law and about politics in general?
<A NAME="796"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Why, no one would have anything to say to them, 
<A NAME="797"></A>if they did not make these professions.
<A NAME="798"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> In all and every art, what the craftsman ought to say 
<A NAME="799"></A>in answer to any question is written down in a popular form, and he who 
<A NAME="800"></A>likes may learn.
<A NAME="801"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I suppose that you are referring to the precepts 
<A NAME="802"></A>of Protagoras about wrestling and the other arts?
<A NAME="803"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Yes, my friend, and about a good many other things. 
<A NAME="804"></A>In a word, is not the art of disputation a power of disputing about all 
<A NAME="805"></A>things?
<A NAME="806"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly; there does not seem to be much which 
<A NAME="807"></A>is left out.
<A NAME="808"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> But oh! my dear youth, do you suppose this possible? 
<A NAME="809"></A>for perhaps your young eyes may see things which to our duller sight do 
<A NAME="810"></A>not appear.
<A NAME="811"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> To what are you alluding? I do not think that I 
<A NAME="812"></A>understand your present question.
<A NAME="813"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> I ask whether anybody can understand all 
<A NAME="814"></A>things.
<A NAME="815"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Happy would mankind be if such a thing were 
<A NAME="816"></A>possible!
<A NAME="817"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But how can any one who is ignorant dispute in a rational 
<A NAME="818"></A>manner against him who knows?
<A NAME="819"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> He cannot.
<A NAME="820"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Then why has the sophistical art such a mysterious 
<A NAME="821"></A>power?
<A NAME="822"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> To what do you refer?
<A NAME="823"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> How do the Sophists make young men believe in their 
<A NAME="824"></A>supreme and universal wisdom? For if they neither disputed nor were thought 
<A NAME="825"></A>to dispute rightly, or being thought to do so were deemed no wiser for 
<A NAME="826"></A>their controversial skill, then, to quote your own observation, no one 
<A NAME="827"></A>would give them money or be willing to learn their art.
<A NAME="828"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> They certainly would not.
<A NAME="829"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> But they are willing.
<A NAME="830"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes, they are.
<A NAME="831"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Yes, and the reason, as I should imagine, is that they 
<A NAME="832"></A>are supposed to have knowledge of those things about which they 
<A NAME="833"></A>dispute?
<A NAME="834"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="835"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And they dispute about all things?
<A NAME="836"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> True.
<A NAME="837"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And therefore, to their disciples, they appear to be 
<A NAME="838"></A>all-wise?
<A NAME="839"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="840"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> But they are not; for that was shown to be 
<A NAME="841"></A>impossible.
<A NAME="842"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Impossible, of course.
<A NAME="843"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Then the Sophist has been shown to have a sort of conjectural 
<A NAME="844"></A>or apparent knowledge only of all things, which is not the 
<A NAME="845"></A>truth?
<A NAME="846"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Exactly; no better description of him could be 
<A NAME="847"></A>given.
<A NAME="848"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Let us now take an illustration, which will still more 
<A NAME="849"></A>clearly explain his nature.
<A NAME="850"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> What is it?
<A NAME="851"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> I will tell you, and you shall answer me, giving your 
<A NAME="852"></A>very closest attention. Suppose that a person were to profess, not that 
<A NAME="853"></A>he could speak or dispute, but that he knew how to make and do all things, 
<A NAME="854"></A>by a single art.
<A NAME="855"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> All things?
<A NAME="856"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> I see that you do not understand the first word that 
<A NAME="857"></A>I utter, for you do not understand the meaning of "all."
<A NAME="858"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> No, I do not.
<A NAME="859"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Under all things, I include you and me, and also animals 
<A NAME="860"></A>and trees.
<A NAME="861"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> What do you mean?
<A NAME="862"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Suppose a person to say that he will make you and me, 
<A NAME="863"></A>and all creatures.
<A NAME="864"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> What would he mean by "making"? He cannot be a husbandman;-for 
<A NAME="865"></A>you said that he is a maker of animals.
<A NAME="866"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Yes; and I say that he is also the maker of the sea, 
<A NAME="867"></A>and the earth, and the heavens, and the gods, and of all other things; 
<A NAME="868"></A>and, further, that he can make them in no time, and sell them for a few 
<A NAME="869"></A>pence.
<A NAME="870"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> That must be a jest.
<A NAME="871"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And when a man says that he knows all things, and can 
<A NAME="872"></A>teach them to another at a small cost, and in a short time, is not that 
<A NAME="873"></A>a jest?
<A NAME="874"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="875"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And is there any more artistic or graceful form of 
<A NAME="876"></A>jest than imitation?
<A NAME="877"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly not; and imitation is a very comprehensive 
<A NAME="878"></A>term, which includes under one class the most diverse sorts of 
<A NAME="879"></A>things.
<A NAME="880"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> We know, of course, that he who professes by one art 
<A NAME="881"></A>to make all things is really a painter, and by the painter's art makes 
<A NAME="882"></A>resemblances of real things which have the same name with them; and he 
<A NAME="883"></A>can deceive the less intelligent sort of young children, to whom he shows 
<A NAME="884"></A>his pictures at a distance, into the belief that he has the absolute power 
<A NAME="885"></A>of making whatever he likes.
<A NAME="886"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="887"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And may there not be supposed to be an imitative art 
<A NAME="888"></A>of reasoning? Is it not possible to enchant the hearts of young men by 
<A NAME="889"></A>words poured through their ears, when they are still at a distance from 
<A NAME="890"></A>the truth of facts, by exhibiting to them fictitious arguments, and making 
<A NAME="891"></A>them think that they are true, and that the speaker is the wisest of men 
<A NAME="892"></A>in all things?
<A NAME="893"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes; why should there not be another such 
<A NAME="894"></A>art?
<A NAME="895"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> But as time goes on, and their hearers advance in years, 
<A NAME="896"></A>and come into closer contact with realities, and have learnt by sad experience 
<A NAME="897"></A>to see and feel the truth of things, are not the greater part of them compelled 
<A NAME="898"></A>to change many opinions which they formerly entertained, so that the great 
<A NAME="899"></A>appears small to them, and the easy difficult, and all their dreamy speculations 
<A NAME="900"></A>are overturned by the facts of life?
<A NAME="901"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> That is my view, as far as I can judge, although, 
<A NAME="902"></A>at my age, I may be one of those who see things at a distance 
<A NAME="903"></A>only.
<A NAME="904"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And the wish of all of us, who are your friends, is 
<A NAME="905"></A>and always will be to bring you as near to the truth as we can without 
<A NAME="906"></A>the sad reality. And now I should like you to tell me, whether the Sophist 
<A NAME="907"></A>is not visibly a magician and imitator of true being; or are we still disposed 
<A NAME="908"></A>to think that he may have a true knowledge of the various matters about 
<A NAME="909"></A>which he disputes?
<A NAME="910"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> But how can he, Stranger? Is there any doubt, after 
<A NAME="911"></A>what has been said, that he is to be located in one of the divisions of 
<A NAME="912"></A>children's play?
<A NAME="913"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Then we must place him in the class of magicians and 
<A NAME="914"></A>mimics.
<A NAME="915"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly we must.
<A NAME="916"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And now our business is not to let the animal out, 
<A NAME="917"></A>for we have got him in a sort of dialectical net, and there is one thing 
<A NAME="918"></A>which he decidedly will not escape.
<A NAME="919"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> What is that?
<A NAME="920"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> The inference that he is a juggler.
<A NAME="921"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Precisely my own opinion of him.
<A NAME="922"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Then, clearly, we ought as soon as possible to divide 
<A NAME="923"></A>the image-making art, and go down into the net, and, if the Sophist does 
<A NAME="924"></A>not run away from us, to seize him according to orders and deliver him 
<A NAME="925"></A>over to reason, who is the lord of the hunt, and proclaim the capture of 
<A NAME="926"></A>him; and if he creeps into the recesses of the imitative art, and secretes 
<A NAME="927"></A>himself in one of them, to divide again and follow him up until in some 
<A NAME="928"></A>sub-section of imitation he is caught. For our method of tackling each 
<A NAME="929"></A>and all is one which neither he nor any other creature will ever escape 
<A NAME="930"></A>in triumph.
<A NAME="931"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Well said; and let us do as you 
<A NAME="932"></A>propose.
<A NAME="933"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Well, then, pursuing the same analytic method as before, 
<A NAME="934"></A>I think that I can discern two divisions of the imitative art, but I am 
<A NAME="935"></A>not as yet able to see in which of them the desired form is to be 
<A NAME="936"></A>found.
<A NAME="937"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Will you tell me first what are two divisions of 
<A NAME="938"></A>which you are speaking?
<A NAME="939"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> One is the art of likeness-making;-generally a likeness 
<A NAME="940"></A>of anything is made by producing a copy which is executed according to 
<A NAME="941"></A>the proportions of the original, similar in length and breadth and depth, 
<A NAME="942"></A>each thing receiving also its appropriate colour.
<A NAME="943"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Is not this always the aim of 
<A NAME="944"></A>imitation?
<A NAME="945"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Not always; in works either of sculpture or of painting, 
<A NAME="946"></A>which are of any magnitude, there is a certain degree of deception; -for 
<A NAME="947"></A>artists were to give the true proportions of their fair works, the upper 
<A NAME="948"></A>part, which is farther off, would appear to be out of proportion in comparison 
<A NAME="949"></A>with the lower, which is nearer; and so they give up the truth in their 
<A NAME="950"></A>images and make only the proportions which appear to be beautiful, disregarding 
<A NAME="951"></A>the real ones.
<A NAME="952"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Quite true.
<A NAME="953"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And that which being other is also like, may we not 
<A NAME="954"></A>fairly call a likeness or image?
<A NAME="955"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="956"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And may we not, as I did just now, call that part of 
<A NAME="957"></A>the imitative art which is concerned with making such images the art of 
<A NAME="958"></A>likeness making?
<A NAME="959"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Let that be the name.
<A NAME="960"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And what shall we call those resemblances of the beautiful, 
<A NAME="961"></A>which appear such owing to the unfavourable position of the spectator, 
<A NAME="962"></A>whereas if a person had the power of getting a correct view of works of 
<A NAME="963"></A>such magnitude, they would appear not even like that to which they profess 
<A NAME="964"></A>to be like? May we not call these "appearances," since they appear only 
<A NAME="965"></A>and are not really like?
<A NAME="966"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="967"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> There is a great deal of this kind of thing in painting, 
<A NAME="968"></A>and in all imitation.
<A NAME="969"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Of course.
<A NAME="970"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And may we not fairly call the sort of art, which produces 
<A NAME="971"></A>an appearance and not an image, phantastic art?
<A NAME="972"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Most fairly.
<A NAME="973"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> These then are the two kinds of image making-the art 
<A NAME="974"></A>of making likenesses, and phantastic or the art of making 
<A NAME="975"></A>appearances?
<A NAME="976"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> True.
<A NAME="977"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> I was doubtful before in which of them I should place 
<A NAME="978"></A>the Sophist, nor am I even now able to see clearly; verily he is a wonderful 
<A NAME="979"></A>and inscrutable creature. And now in the cleverest manner he has got into 
<A NAME="980"></A>an impossible place.
<A NAME="981"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes, he has.
<A NAME="982"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Do you speak advisedly, or are you carried away at 
<A NAME="983"></A>the moment by the habit of assenting into giving a hasty 
<A NAME="984"></A>answer?
<A NAME="985"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> May I ask to what you are referring?
<A NAME="986"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> My dear friend, we are engaged in a very difficult 
<A NAME="987"></A>speculation-there can be no doubt of that; for how a thing can appear and 
<A NAME="988"></A>seem, and not be, or how a man can say a thing which is not true, has always 
<A NAME="989"></A>been and still remains a very perplexing question. Can any one say or think 
<A NAME="990"></A>that falsehood really exists, and avoid being caught in a contradiction? 
<A NAME="991"></A>Indeed, Theaetetus, the task is a difficult one.
<A NAME="992"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Why?
<A NAME="993"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> He who says that falsehood exists has the audacity 
<A NAME="994"></A>to assert the being of not-being; for this is implied in the possibility 
<A NAME="995"></A>of falsehood. But, my boy, in the days when I was a boy, the great Parmenides 
<A NAME="996"></A>protested against this doctrine, and to the end of his life he continued 
<A NAME="997"></A>to inculcate the same lesson-always repeating both in verse and out of 
<A NAME="998"></A>verse:
<A NAME="999"></A><BR><BR>Keep your mind from this way of enquiry, for never will you show 
<A NAME="1000"></A>that not-being is Such is his testimony, which is confirmed by the very 
<A NAME="1001"></A>expression when sifted a little. Would you object to begin with the consideration 
<A NAME="1002"></A>of the words themselves?
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Never mind about me; I am only desirous that you 
<A NAME="1004"></A>should carry on the argument in the best way, and that you should take 
<A NAME="1005"></A>me with you.
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Very good; and now say, do we venture to utter the 
<A NAME="1007"></A>forbidden word "not-being"?
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly we do.
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Let us be serious then, and consider the question neither 
<A NAME="1010"></A>in strife nor play: suppose that one of the hearers of Parmenides was asked, 
<A NAME="1011"></A>"To is the term 'not-being' to be applied?"-do you know what sort of object 
<A NAME="1012"></A>he would single out in reply, and what answer he would make to the 
<A NAME="1013"></A>enquirer?
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> That is a difficult question, and one not to be 
<A NAME="1015"></A>answered at all by a person like myself.
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> There is at any rate no difficulty in seeing that the 
<A NAME="1017"></A>predicate "not-being" is not applicable to any being.
<A NAME="1018"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> None, certainly.
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And if not to being, then not to 
<A NAME="1020"></A>something.
<A NAME="1021"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Of course not.
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> It is also plain, that in speaking of something we 
<A NAME="1023"></A>speak of being, for to speak of an abstract something naked and isolated 
<A NAME="1024"></A>from all being is impossible.
<A NAME="1025"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Impossible.
<A NAME="1026"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> You mean by assenting to imply that he who says something 
<A NAME="1027"></A>must say some one thing?
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Some in the singular (ti) you would say is the sign 
<A NAME="1030"></A>of one, some in the dual (tine) of two, some in the plural (tines) of 
<A NAME="1031"></A>many?
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Exactly.
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Then he who says "not something" must say absolutely 
<A NAME="1034"></A>nothing.
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Most assuredly.
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And as we cannot admit that a man speaks and says nothing, 
<A NAME="1037"></A>he who says "not-being" does not speak at all.
<A NAME="1038"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> The difficulty of the argument can no further 
<A NAME="1039"></A>go.
<A NAME="1040"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Not yet, my friend, is the time for such a word; for 
<A NAME="1041"></A>there still remains of all perplexities the first and greatest, touching 
<A NAME="1042"></A>the very foundation of the matter.
<A NAME="1043"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> What do you mean? Do not be afraid to 
<A NAME="1044"></A>speak.
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> To that which is, may be attributed some other thing 
<A NAME="1046"></A>which is?
<A NAME="1047"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> But can anything which is, be attributed to that which 
<A NAME="1049"></A>is not?
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Impossible.
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And all number is to be reckoned among things which 
<A NAME="1052"></A>are?
<A NAME="1053"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes, surely number, if anything, has a real 
<A NAME="1054"></A>existence.
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Then we must not attempt to attribute to not-being 
<A NAME="1056"></A>number either in the singular or plural?
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> The argument implies that we should be wrong in 
<A NAME="1058"></A>doing so.
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> But how can a man either express in words or even conceive 
<A NAME="1060"></A>in thought things which are not or a thing which is not without 
<A NAME="1061"></A>number?
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> How indeed?
<A NAME="1063"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> When we speak of things which are not attributing plurality 
<A NAME="1064"></A>to not-being?
<A NAME="1065"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> But, on the other hand, when we say "what is not," 
<A NAME="1067"></A>do we not attribute unity?
<A NAME="1068"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Manifestly.
<A NAME="1069"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Nevertheless, we maintain that you may not and ought 
<A NAME="1070"></A>not to attribute being to not-being?
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Most true.
<A NAME="1072"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Do you see, then, that not-being in itself can neither 
<A NAME="1073"></A>be spoken, uttered, or thought, but that it is unthinkable, unutterable, 
<A NAME="1074"></A>unspeakable, indescribable?
<A NAME="1075"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Quite true.
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> But, if so, I was wrong in telling you just now that 
<A NAME="1077"></A>the difficulty which was coming is the greatest of all.
<A NAME="1078"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> What! is there a greater still 
<A NAME="1079"></A>behind?
<A NAME="1080"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Well, I am surprised, after what has been said already, 
<A NAME="1081"></A>that you do not see the difficulty in which he who would refute the notion 
<A NAME="1082"></A>of not-being is involved. For he is compelled to contradict himself as 
<A NAME="1083"></A>soon as he makes the attempt.
<A NAME="1084"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> What do you mean? Speak more 
<A NAME="1085"></A>clearly.
<A NAME="1086"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Do not expect clearness from me. For I, who maintain 
<A NAME="1087"></A>that not-being has no part either in the one or many, just now spoke and 
<A NAME="1088"></A>am still speaking of not-being as one; for I say "not-being." Do you 
<A NAME="1089"></A>understand?
<A NAME="1090"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="1091"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And a little while ago I said that not-being is unutterable, 
<A NAME="1092"></A>unspeakable, indescribable: do you follow?
<A NAME="1093"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I do after a fashion.
<A NAME="1094"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> When I introduced the word "is," did I not contradict 
<A NAME="1095"></A>what I said before?
<A NAME="1096"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Clearly.
<A NAME="1097"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And in using the singular verb, did I not speak of 
<A NAME="1098"></A>not-being as one?
<A NAME="1099"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="1100"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And when I spoke of not-being as indescribable and 
<A NAME="1101"></A>unspeakable and unutterable, in using each of these words in the singular, 
<A NAME="1102"></A>did I not refer to not-being as one?
<A NAME="1103"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="1104"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And yet we say that, strictly speaking, it should not 
<A NAME="1105"></A>be defined as one or many, and should not even be called "it," for the 
<A NAME="1106"></A>use of the word "it" would imply a form of unity.
<A NAME="1107"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Quite true.
<A NAME="1108"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> How, then, can any one put any faith in me? For now, 
<A NAME="1109"></A>as always, I am unequal to the refutation of not-being. And therefore, 
<A NAME="1110"></A>as I was saying, do not look to me for the right way of speaking about 
<A NAME="1111"></A>not-being; but come, let us try the experiment with 
<A NAME="1112"></A>you.
<A NAME="1113"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> What do you mean?
<A NAME="1114"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Make a noble effort, as becomes youth, and endeavour 
<A NAME="1115"></A>with all your might to speak of not-being in a right manner, without introducing 
<A NAME="1116"></A>into it either existence or unity or plurality.
<A NAME="1117"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> It would be a strange boldness in me which would 
<A NAME="1118"></A>attempt the task when I see you thus discomfited.
<A NAME="1119"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Say no more of ourselves; but until we find some one 
<A NAME="1120"></A>or other who can speak of not-being without number, we must acknowledge 
<A NAME="1121"></A>that the Sophist is a clever rogue who will not be got out of his 
<A NAME="1122"></A>hole.
<A NAME="1123"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Most true.
<A NAME="1124"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And if we say to him that he professes an art of making 
<A NAME="1125"></A>appearances, he will grapple with us and retort our argument upon ourselves; 
<A NAME="1126"></A>and when we call him an image-maker he will say, "Pray what do you mean 
<A NAME="1127"></A>at all by an image?" -and I should like to know, Theaetetus, how we can 
<A NAME="1128"></A>possibly answer the younker's question?
<A NAME="1129"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> We shall doubtless tell him of the images which 
<A NAME="1130"></A>are reflected in water or in mirrors; also of sculptures, pictures, and 
<A NAME="1131"></A>other duplicates.
<A NAME="1132"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> I see, Theaetetus, that you have never made the acquaintance 
<A NAME="1133"></A>of the Sophist.
<A NAME="1134"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Why do you think so?
<A NAME="1135"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> He will make believe to have his eyes shut, or to have 
<A NAME="1136"></A>none.
<A NAME="1137"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> What do you mean?
<A NAME="1138"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> When you tell him of something existing in a mirror, 
<A NAME="1139"></A>or in sculpture, and address him as though he had eyes, he will laugh you 
<A NAME="1140"></A>to scorn, and will pretend that he knows nothing of mirrors and streams, 
<A NAME="1141"></A>or of sight at all; he will say that he is asking about an 
<A NAME="1142"></A>idea.
<A NAME="1143"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> What can he mean?
<A NAME="1144"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> The common notion pervading all these objects, which 
<A NAME="1145"></A>you speak of as many, and yet call by the single name of image, as though 
<A NAME="1146"></A>it were the unity under which they were all included. How will you maintain 
<A NAME="1147"></A>your ground against him?
<A NAME="1148"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> How. Stranger, can I describe an image except as 
<A NAME="1149"></A>something fashioned in the likeness of the true?
<A NAME="1150"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And do you mean this something to be some other true 
<A NAME="1151"></A>thing, or what do you mean?
<A NAME="1152"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly not another true thing, but only a 
<A NAME="1153"></A>resemblance.
<A NAME="1154"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And you mean by true that which really 
<A NAME="1155"></A>is?
<A NAME="1156"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="1157"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And the not true is that which is the opposite of the 
<A NAME="1158"></A>true?
<A NAME="1159"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Exactly.
<A NAME="1160"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> A resemblance, then, is not really real, if, as you 
<A NAME="1161"></A>say, not true?
<A NAME="1162"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Nay, but it is in a certain sense.
<A NAME="1163"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> You mean to say, not in a true sense?
<A NAME="1164"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes; it is in reality only an 
<A NAME="1165"></A>image.
<A NAME="1166"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Then what we call an image is in reality really 
<A NAME="1167"></A>unreal.
<A NAME="1168"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> In what a strange complication of being and not-being 
<A NAME="1169"></A>we are involved!
<A NAME="1170"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Strange! I should think so. See how, by his reciprocation 
<A NAME="1171"></A>of opposites, the many-headed Sophist has compelled us, quite against our 
<A NAME="1172"></A>will, to admit the existence of not-being.
<A NAME="1173"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes, indeed, I see.
<A NAME="1174"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> The difficulty is how to define his art without falling 
<A NAME="1175"></A>into a contradiction.
<A NAME="1176"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> How do you mean? And where does the danger 
<A NAME="1177"></A>lie?
<A NAME="1178"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> When we say that he deceives us with an illusion, and 
<A NAME="1179"></A>that his art is illusory, do we mean that our soul is led by his art to 
<A NAME="1180"></A>think falsely, or what do we mean?
<A NAME="1181"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> There is nothing else to be said.
<A NAME="1182"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Again, false opinion is that form of opinion which 
<A NAME="1183"></A>thinks the opposite of the truth:-You would assent?
<A NAME="1184"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="1185"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> You mean to say that false opinion thinks what is 
<A NAME="1186"></A>not?
<A NAME="1187"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Of course.
<A NAME="1188"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Does false opinion think that things which are not 
<A NAME="1189"></A>are not, or that in a certain sense they are?
<A NAME="1190"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Things that are not must be imagined to exist in 
<A NAME="1191"></A>a certain sense, if any degree of falsehood is to be 
<A NAME="1192"></A>possible.
<A NAME="1193"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And does not false opinion also think that things which 
<A NAME="1194"></A>most certainly exist do not exist at all?
<A NAME="1195"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="1196"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And here, again, is falsehood?
<A NAME="1197"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Falsehood-yes.
<A NAME="1198"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And in like manner, a false proposition will be deemed 
<A NAME="1199"></A>to be one which are, the nonexistence of things which are, and the existence 
<A NAME="1200"></A>of things which are not.
<A NAME="1201"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> There is no other way in which a false proposition 
<A NAME="1202"></A>can arise.
<A NAME="1203"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> There is not; but the Sophist will deny these statements. 
<A NAME="1204"></A>And indeed how can any rational man assent to them, when the very expressions 
<A NAME="1205"></A>which we have just used were before acknowledged by us to be unutterable, 
<A NAME="1206"></A>unspeakable, indescribable, unthinkable? Do you see his point, 
<A NAME="1207"></A>Theaetetus?
<A NAME="1208"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Of course he will say that we are contradicting 
<A NAME="1209"></A>ourselves when we hazard the assertion, that falsehood exists in opinion 
<A NAME="1210"></A>and in words; for in maintaining this, we are compelled over and over again 
<A NAME="1211"></A>to assert being of not-being, which we admitted just now to be an utter 
<A NAME="1212"></A>impossibility.
<A NAME="1213"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> How well you remember! And now it is high time to hold 
<A NAME="1214"></A>a consultation as to what we ought to do about the Sophist; for if we persist 
<A NAME="1215"></A>in looking for him in the class of false workers and magicians, you see 
<A NAME="1216"></A>that the handles for objection and the difficulties which will arise are 
<A NAME="1217"></A>very numerous and obvious.
<A NAME="1218"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> They are indeed.
<A NAME="1219"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> We have gone through but a very small portion of them, 
<A NAME="1220"></A>and they are really infinite.
<A NAME="1221"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> If that is the case, we cannot possibly catch the 
<A NAME="1222"></A>Sophist.
<A NAME="1223"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Shall we then be so faint-hearted as to give him 
<A NAME="1224"></A>up?
<A NAME="1225"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly not, I should say, if we can get the slightest 
<A NAME="1226"></A>hold upon him.
<A NAME="1227"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Will you then forgive me, and, as your words imply, 
<A NAME="1228"></A>not be altogether displeased if I flinch a little from the grasp of such 
<A NAME="1229"></A>a sturdy argument?
<A NAME="1230"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> To be sure I will.
<A NAME="1231"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> I have a yet more urgent request to 
<A NAME="1232"></A>make.
<A NAME="1233"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Which is-?
<A NAME="1234"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> That you will promise not to regard me as a 
<A NAME="1235"></A>parricide.
<A NAME="1236"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> And why?
<A NAME="1237"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Because, in self-defence, I must test the philosophy 
<A NAME="1238"></A>of my father Parmenides, and try to prove by main force, that in a certain 
<A NAME="1239"></A>sense not-being is, and that being, on the other hand, is 
<A NAME="1240"></A>not.
<A NAME="1241"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Some attempt of the kind is clearly 
<A NAME="1242"></A>needed.
<A NAME="1243"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Yes, a blind man, as they say, might see that, and, 
<A NAME="1244"></A>unless these questions are decided in one way or another, no one when he 
<A NAME="1245"></A>speaks false words, or false opinion, or idols, or images or imitations 
<A NAME="1246"></A>or appearances, or about the arts which are concerned with them; can avoid 
<A NAME="1247"></A>falling into ridiculous contradictions.
<A NAME="1248"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Most true.
<A NAME="1249"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And therefore I must venture to lay hands on my father's 
<A NAME="1250"></A>argument; for if I am to be over-scrupulous, I shall have to give the matter 
<A NAME="1251"></A>up.
<A NAME="1252"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Nothing in the world should ever induce us to do 
<A NAME="1253"></A>so.
<A NAME="1254"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> I have a third little request which I wish to 
<A NAME="1255"></A>make.
<A NAME="1256"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> What is it?
<A NAME="1257"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> You heard me-say what-I have always felt and still 
<A NAME="1258"></A>feel-that I have no heart for this argument?
<A NAME="1259"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I did.
<A NAME="1260"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> I tremble at the thought of what I have said, and expect 
<A NAME="1261"></A>that you will deem me mad, when you hear of my sudden changes and shiftings; 
<A NAME="1262"></A>let me therefore observe, that I am examining the question entirely out 
<A NAME="1263"></A>of regard for you.
<A NAME="1264"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> There is no reason for you to fear that I shall 
<A NAME="1265"></A>impute any impropriety to you, if you attempt this refutation and proof; 
<A NAME="1266"></A>take heart, therefore, and proceed.
<A NAME="1267"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And where shall I begin the perilous enterprise? I 
<A NAME="1268"></A>think that the road which I must take is-
<A NAME="1269"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Which?-Let me hear.
<A NAME="1270"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> I think that we had better, first of all, consider 
<A NAME="1271"></A>the points which at present are regard as self-evident, lest we may have 
<A NAME="1272"></A>fallen into some confusion, and be too ready to assent to one another, 
<A NAME="1273"></A>fancying that we are quite clear about them.
<A NAME="1274"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Say more distinctly what you 
<A NAME="1275"></A>mean.
<A NAME="1276"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> I think that Parmenides, and all ever yet undertook 
<A NAME="1277"></A>to determine the number and nature of existences, talked to us in rather 
<A NAME="1278"></A>a light and easy strain.
<A NAME="1279"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> How?
<A NAME="1280"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> As if we had been children, to whom they repeated each 
<A NAME="1281"></A>his own mythus or story;-one said that there were three principles, and 
<A NAME="1282"></A>that at one time there was war between certain of them; and then again 
<A NAME="1283"></A>there was peace, and they were married and begat children, and brought 
<A NAME="1284"></A>them up; and another spoke of two principles,-a moist and a dry, or a hot 
<A NAME="1285"></A>and a cold, and made them marry and cohabit. The Eleatics, however, in 
<A NAME="1286"></A>our part of the world, say that things are many in name, but in nature 
<A NAME="1287"></A>one; this is their mythus, which goes back to Xenophanes, and is even older. 
<A NAME="1288"></A>Then there are Ionian, and in more recent times Sicilian muses, who have 
<A NAME="1289"></A>arrived at the conclusion that to unite the two principles is safer, and 
<A NAME="1290"></A>to say that being is one and many, and that these are held together by 
<A NAME="1291"></A>enmity and friendship, ever parting, ever meeting, as the-severer Muses 
<A NAME="1292"></A>assert, while the gentler ones do not insist on the perpetual strife and 
<A NAME="1293"></A>peace, but admit a relaxation and alternation of them; peace and unity 
<A NAME="1294"></A>sometimes prevailing under the sway of Aphrodite, and then again plurality 
<A NAME="1295"></A>and war, by reason of a principle of strife. Whether any of them spoke 
<A NAME="1296"></A>the truth in all this is hard to determine; besides, antiquity and famous 
<A NAME="1297"></A>men should have reverence, and not be liable to accusations; so serious; 
<A NAME="1298"></A>Yet one thing may be said of them without offence-
<A NAME="1299"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> What thing?
<A NAME="1300"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> That they went on their several ways disdaining to 
<A NAME="1301"></A>notice people like ourselves; they did not care whether they took us with 
<A NAME="1302"></A>them, or left us behind them.
<A NAME="1303"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> How do you mean?
<A NAME="1304"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> I mean to say, that when they talk of one, two, or 
<A NAME="1305"></A>more elements, which are or have become or are becoming, or again of heat 
<A NAME="1306"></A>mingling with cold, assuming in some other part of their works separations 
<A NAME="1307"></A>and mixtures,-tell me, Theaetetus, do you understand what they mean by 
<A NAME="1308"></A>these expressions? When I was a younger man, I used to fancy that I understood 
<A NAME="1309"></A>quite well what was meant by the term "not-being," which is our present 
<A NAME="1310"></A>subject of dispute; and now you see in what a fix we are about 
<A NAME="1311"></A>it.
<A NAME="1312"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I see.
<A NAME="1313"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And very likely we have been getting into the same 
<A NAME="1314"></A>perplexity about "being," and yet may fancy that when anybody utters the 
<A NAME="1315"></A>word, we understand him quite easily, although we do not know about not-being. 
<A NAME="1316"></A>But we may be; equally ignorant of both.
<A NAME="1317"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I dare say.
<A NAME="1318"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And the same may be said of all the terms just 
<A NAME="1319"></A>mentioned.
<A NAME="1320"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> True.
<A NAME="1321"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> The consideration of most of them may be deferred; 
<A NAME="1322"></A>but we had better now discuss the chief captain and leader of 
<A NAME="1323"></A>them.
<A NAME="1324"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Of what are you speaking? You clearly think that 
<A NAME="1325"></A>we must first investigate what people mean by the word 
<A NAME="1326"></A>"being."
<A NAME="1327"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> You follow close at heels, Theaetetus. For the right 
<A NAME="1328"></A>method, I conceive, will be to call into our presence the dualistic philosophers 
<A NAME="1329"></A>and to interrogate them. "Come," we will say, "Ye, who affirm that hot 
<A NAME="1330"></A>and cold or any other two principles are the universe, what is this term 
<A NAME="1331"></A>which you apply to both of them, and what do you mean when you say that 
<A NAME="1332"></A>both and each of them 'are'? How are we to understand the word 'are'? Upon 
<A NAME="1333"></A>your view, are we to suppose that there is a third principle over and above 
<A NAME="1334"></A>the other two-three in all, and not two? For clearly you cannot say that 
<A NAME="1335"></A>one of the two principles is being, and yet attribute being equally to 
<A NAME="1336"></A>both of them; for, if you did, whichever of the two is identified with 
<A NAME="1337"></A>being, will comprehend the other; and so they will be one and not 
<A NAME="1338"></A>two."
<A NAME="1339"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="1340"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> But perhaps you mean to give the name of "being" to 
<A NAME="1341"></A>both of them together?
<A NAME="1342"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Quite likely.
<A NAME="1343"></A><BR>Str. "Then, friends," we shall reply to them, "the answer is plainly 
<A NAME="1344"></A>that the two will still be resolved into one."
<A NAME="1345"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Most true.
<A NAME="1346"></A><BR>Str. "Since then, we are in a difficulty, please to tell us what you 
<A NAME="1347"></A>mean, when you speak of being; for there can be no doubt that you always 
<A NAME="1348"></A>from the first understood your own meaning, whereas we once thought that 
<A NAME="1349"></A>we understood you, but now we are in a great strait. Please to begin by 
<A NAME="1350"></A>explaining this matter to us, and let us no longer fancy that we understand 
<A NAME="1351"></A>you, when we entirely misunderstand you." There will be no impropriety 
<A NAME="1352"></A>in our demanding an answer to this question, either of the dualists or 
<A NAME="1353"></A>of the pluralists?
<A NAME="1354"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly not.
<A NAME="1355"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And what about the assertors of the oneness of the 
<A NAME="1356"></A>all-must we not endeavour to ascertain from them what they mean by 
<A NAME="1357"></A>"being"?
<A NAME="1358"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> By all means.
<A NAME="1359"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Then let them answer this question: One, you say, alone 
<A NAME="1360"></A>is? "Yes," they will reply.
<A NAME="1361"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> True.
<A NAME="1362"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And there is something which you call 
<A NAME="1363"></A>"being"?
<A NAME="1364"></A><BR>Theaet. "Yes."
<A NAME="1365"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And is being the same as one, and do you apply two 
<A NAME="1366"></A>names to the same thing?
<A NAME="1367"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> What will be their answer, Stranger?
<A NAME="1368"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> It is clear, Theaetetus, that he who asserts the unity
