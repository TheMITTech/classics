<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>In the next place, dealings between man and man require to be suitably 
<A NAME="11"></A>regulated. The principle of them is very simple:-Thou shalt not, if thou 
<A NAME="12"></A>canst help, touch that which is mine, or remove the least thing which belongs 
<A NAME="13"></A>to me without my consent; and may I be of a sound mind, and do to others 
<A NAME="14"></A>as I would that they should do to me. First, let us speak of treasure trove:-May 
<A NAME="15"></A>I never pray the Gods to find the hidden treasure, which another has laid 
<A NAME="16"></A>up for himself and his family, he not being one of my ancestors, nor lift, 
<A NAME="17"></A>if I should find, such a treasure. And may I never have any dealings with 
<A NAME="18"></A>those who are called diviners, and who in any way or manner counsel me 
<A NAME="19"></A>to take up the deposit entrusted to the earth, for I should not gain so 
<A NAME="20"></A>much in the increase of my possessions, if I take up the prize, as I should 
<A NAME="21"></A>grow in justice and virtue of soul, if I abstain; and this will be a better 
<A NAME="22"></A>possession to me than the other in a better part of myself; for the possession 
<A NAME="23"></A>of justice in the soul is preferable to the possession of wealth. And of 
<A NAME="24"></A>many things it is well said-"Move not the immovables," and this may be 
<A NAME="25"></A>regarded as one of them. And we shall do well to believe the common tradition 
<A NAME="26"></A>which says that such deeds prevent a man from having a family. Now as to 
<A NAME="27"></A>him who is careless about having children and regardless of the legislator, 
<A NAME="28"></A>taking up that which neither he deposited, nor any ancestor of his, without 
<A NAME="29"></A>the consent of the depositor, violating the simplest and noblest of laws 
<A NAME="30"></A>which was the enactment of no mean man:-"Take not up that which was not 
<A NAME="31"></A>laid down by thee"-of him, I say, who despises these two legislators, and 
<A NAME="32"></A>takes up, not small matter which he has not deposited, but perhaps a great 
<A NAME="33"></A>heap of treasure, what he ought to suffer at the hands of the Gods, God 
<A NAME="34"></A>only knows; but I would have the first person who sees him go and tell 
<A NAME="35"></A>the wardens of the city, if the occurrence has taken place in the city, 
<A NAME="36"></A>or if the occurrence has taken place in the agora he shall tell the wardens 
<A NAME="37"></A>of the agora, or if in the country he shall tell the wardens of the country 
<A NAME="38"></A>and their commanders. When information has been received the city shall 
<A NAME="39"></A>send to Delphi, and, whatever the God answers about the money and the remover 
<A NAME="40"></A>of the money, that the city shall do in obedience to the oracle; the informer, 
<A NAME="41"></A>if he be a freeman, shall have the honour of doing rightly, and he who 
<A NAME="42"></A>informs not, the dishonour of doing wrongly; and if he be a slave who gives 
<A NAME="43"></A>information, let him be freed, as he ought to be, by the state, which shall 
<A NAME="44"></A>give his master the price of him; but if he do not inform he shall be punished 
<A NAME="45"></A>with death. Next in order shall follow a similar law, which shall apply 
<A NAME="46"></A>equally to matters great and small:-If a man happens to leave behind him 
<A NAME="47"></A>some part of his property, whether intentionally or unintentionally, let 
<A NAME="48"></A>him who may come upon the left property suffer it to remain, reflecting 
<A NAME="49"></A>that such things are under the protection of the Goddess of ways, and are 
<A NAME="50"></A>dedicated to her by the law. But if any one defies the law, and takes the 
<A NAME="51"></A>property home with him, let him, if the thing is of little worth, and the 
<A NAME="52"></A>man who takes it a slave, be beaten with many stripes by him, being a person 
<A NAME="53"></A>of not less than thirty years of age. Or if he be a freeman, in addition 
<A NAME="54"></A>to being thought a mean person and a despiser of the laws, let him pay 
<A NAME="55"></A>ten times the value of the treasure which he has moved to the leaver. And 
<A NAME="56"></A>if some one accuses another of having anything which belongs to him, whether 
<A NAME="57"></A>little or much, and the other admits that he has this thing, but denies 
<A NAME="58"></A>that the property in dispute belongs to other, if the property be registered 
<A NAME="59"></A>with the magistrates according to law, the claimant shall summon the possessor, 
<A NAME="60"></A>who shall bring it before the magistrates; and when it is brought into 
<A NAME="61"></A>court, if it be registered in the public registers, to which of the litigants 
<A NAME="62"></A>it belonged, let him take it and go his way. Or if the property be registered 
<A NAME="63"></A>as belonging to some one who is not present, whoever will offer sufficient 
<A NAME="64"></A>surety on behalf of the absent person that he will give it up to him, shall 
<A NAME="65"></A>take it away as the representative of the other. But if the property which 
<A NAME="66"></A>is deposited be not registered with the magistrates, let it remain until 
<A NAME="67"></A>the time of trial with three of the eldest of the magistrates; and if it 
<A NAME="68"></A>be an animal which is deposited, then he who loses the suit shall pay the 
<A NAME="69"></A>magistrates for its keep, and they shall determine the cause within three 
<A NAME="70"></A>days.
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>Any one who is of sound mind may arrest his own slave, and do with 
<A NAME="72"></A>him whatever he will of such things as are lawful; and he may arrest the 
<A NAME="73"></A>runaway slave of any of his friends or kindred with a view to his safe-keeping. 
<A NAME="74"></A>And if any one takes away him who is being carried off as a slave, intending 
<A NAME="75"></A>to liberate him, he who is carrying him off shall let him go; but he who 
<A NAME="76"></A>takes him away shall give three sufficient sureties; and if he give them, 
<A NAME="77"></A>and not without giving them, he may take him away, but if he take him away 
<A NAME="78"></A>after any other manner he shall be deemed guilty of violence, and being 
<A NAME="79"></A>convicted shall pay as a penalty double the amount of the damages claimed 
<A NAME="80"></A>to him who has been deprived of the slave. Any man may also carry off a 
<A NAME="81"></A>freedman, if he do not pay respect or sufficient respect to him who freed 
<A NAME="82"></A>him. Now the respect shall be, that the freedman go three times in the 
<A NAME="83"></A>month to the hearth of the person who freed him and offer to do whatever 
<A NAME="84"></A>he ought, so far as he can; and he shall agree to make such a marriage 
<A NAME="85"></A>as his former master approves. He shall not be permitted to have more property 
<A NAME="86"></A>than he who gave him liberty, and what more he has shall belong to his 
<A NAME="87"></A>master. The freedman shall not remain in the state more than twenty years, 
<A NAME="88"></A>but like other foreigners shall go away, taking his entire property with 
<A NAME="89"></A>him, unless he has the consent of the magistrates and of his former master 
<A NAME="90"></A>to remain. If a freedman or any other stranger has a property greater than 
<A NAME="91"></A>the census of the third class, at the expiration. of thirty days from the 
<A NAME="92"></A>day on which this comes to pass, he shall take that which is his and go 
<A NAME="93"></A>his way, and in this case he shall not be allowed to remain any longer 
<A NAME="94"></A>by the magistrates. And if any one disobeys this regulation, and is brought 
<A NAME="95"></A>into court and convicted, he shall be punished with death, his property 
<A NAME="96"></A>shall be confiscated. Suits about these matters shall take place before 
<A NAME="97"></A>the tribes, unless the plaintiff and defendant have got rid of the accusation 
<A NAME="98"></A>either before their neighbours or before judges chosen by them. If a man 
<A NAME="99"></A>lay claim to any animal or anything else which he declares to be his, let 
<A NAME="100"></A>the possessor refer to the seller or to some honest and trustworthy person, 
<A NAME="101"></A>who has given, or in some legitimate way made over the property to him; 
<A NAME="102"></A>if he be a citizen or a metic, sojourning in the city, within thirty days, 
<A NAME="103"></A>or, if the property have been delivered to him by a stranger, within five 
<A NAME="104"></A>months, of which the middle month shall include the summer solstice. When 
<A NAME="105"></A>goods are exchanged by selling and buying, a man shall deliver them, and 
<A NAME="106"></A>receive the price of them, at a fixed place in the agora, and have done 
<A NAME="107"></A>with the matter; but he shall not buy or sell anywhere else, nor give credit. 
<A NAME="108"></A>And if in any other manner or in any other place there be an exchange of 
<A NAME="109"></A>one thing for another, and the seller give credit to the man who buys fram 
<A NAME="110"></A>him, he must do this on the understanding that the law gives no protection 
<A NAME="111"></A>in cases of things sold not in accordance with these regulations. Again, 
<A NAME="112"></A>as to contributions, any man who likes may go about collecting contributions 
<A NAME="113"></A>as a friend among friends, but if any difference arises about the collection, 
<A NAME="114"></A>he is to act on the understanding that the law gives no protection in such 
<A NAME="115"></A>cases. He who sells anything above the value of fifty drachmas shall be 
<A NAME="116"></A>required to remain in the city for ten days, and the purchaser shall be 
<A NAME="117"></A>informed of the house of the seller, with a view to the sort of charges 
<A NAME="118"></A>which are apt to arise in such cases, and the restitutions which the law 
<A NAME="119"></A>allows. And let legal restitution be on this wise:-If a man sells a slave 
<A NAME="120"></A>who is in a consumption, or who has the disease of the stone, or of strangury, 
<A NAME="121"></A>or epilepsy, or some other tedious and incurable disorder of body or mind, 
<A NAME="122"></A>which is not discernible to the ordinary man, if the purchaser be a physician 
<A NAME="123"></A>or trainer, he shall have no right of restitution; nor shall there be any 
<A NAME="124"></A>right of restitution if the seller has told the truth beforehand to the 
<A NAME="125"></A>buyer. But if a skilled person sells to another who is not skilled, let 
<A NAME="126"></A>the buyer appeal for restitution within six months, except in the case 
<A NAME="127"></A>of epilepsy, and then the appeal may be made within a year. The cause shall 
<A NAME="128"></A>be determined by such physicians as the parties may agree to choose; and 
<A NAME="129"></A>the defendant, if he lose the suit, shall pay double the price at which 
<A NAME="130"></A>he sold. If a private person sell to another private person, he shall have 
<A NAME="131"></A>the right of restitution, and the decision shall be given as before, but 
<A NAME="132"></A>the defendant, if he be cast, shall only pay back the price of the slave. 
<A NAME="133"></A>If a person sells a homicide to another, and they both know of the fact, 
<A NAME="134"></A>let there be no restitution in such a case, but if he do not know of the 
<A NAME="135"></A>fact, there shall be a right of restitution, whenever the buyer makes the 
<A NAME="136"></A>discovery; and the decision shall rest with the five youngest guardians 
<A NAME="137"></A>of the law, and if the decision be that the seller was cognisant the fact, 
<A NAME="138"></A>he shall purify the house of the purchaser, according to the law of the 
<A NAME="139"></A>interpreters, and shall pay back three times the purchase-money.
<A NAME="140"></A><BR><BR>If man exchanges either money for money, or anything whatever for 
<A NAME="141"></A>anything else, either with or without life, let him give and receive them 
<A NAME="142"></A>genuine and unadulterated, in accordance with the law. And let us have 
<A NAME="143"></A>a prelude about all this sort of roguery, like the preludes of our other 
<A NAME="144"></A>laws. Every man should regard adulteration as of one and the same class 
<A NAME="145"></A>with falsehood and deceit, concerning which the many are too fond of saying 
<A NAME="146"></A>that at proper times and places the practice may often be right. But they 
<A NAME="147"></A>leave the occasion, and the when, and the where, undefined and unsettled, 
<A NAME="148"></A>and from this want of definiteness in their language they do a great deal 
<A NAME="149"></A>of harm to themselves and to others. Now a legislator ought not to leave 
<A NAME="150"></A>the matter undetermined; he ought to prescribe some limit, either greater 
<A NAME="151"></A>or less. Let this be the rule prescribed:-No one shall call the Gods to 
<A NAME="152"></A>witness, when he says or does anything false or deceitful or dishonest, 
<A NAME="153"></A>unless he would be the most hateful of mankind to them. And he is most 
<A NAME="154"></A>hateful to them takes a false oath, and pays no heed to the Gods; and in 
<A NAME="155"></A>the next degree, he who tells a falsehood in the presence of his superiors. 
<A NAME="156"></A>Now better men are the superiors of worse men, and in general elders are 
<A NAME="157"></A>the superiors of the young; wherefore also parents are the superiors of 
<A NAME="158"></A>their off spring, and men of women and children, and rulers of their subjects; 
<A NAME="159"></A>for all men ought to reverence any one who is in any position of authority, 
<A NAME="160"></A>and especially those who are in state offices. And this is the reason why 
<A NAME="161"></A>I have spoken of these matters. For every one who is guilty of adulteration 
<A NAME="162"></A>in the agora tells a falsehood, and deceives, and when he invokes the Gods, 
<A NAME="163"></A>according to the customs and cautions of the wardens of the agora, he does 
<A NAME="164"></A>but swear without any respect for God or man. Certainly, it is an excellent 
<A NAME="165"></A>rule not lightly to defile the names of the Gods, after the fashion of 
<A NAME="166"></A>men in general, who care little about piety and purity in their religious 
<A NAME="167"></A>actions. But if a man will not conform to this rule, let the law be as 
<A NAME="168"></A>follows:-He who sells anything in the agora shall not ask two prices for 
<A NAME="169"></A>that which he sells, but he shall ask one price, and if he do not obtain 
<A NAME="170"></A>this, he shall take away his goods; and on that day he shall not value 
<A NAME="171"></A>them either at more or less; and there shall be no praising of any goods, 
<A NAME="172"></A>or oath taken about them. If a person disobeys this command, any citizen 
<A NAME="173"></A>who is present, not being less than thirty years of age, may with impunity 
<A NAME="174"></A>chastise and beat the swearer, but if instead of obeying the laws he takes 
<A NAME="175"></A>no heed, he shall be liable to the charge of having betrayed them. If a 
<A NAME="176"></A>man sells any adulterated goods and will not obey these regulations, he 
<A NAME="177"></A>who knows and can prove the fact, and does prove it in the presence of 
<A NAME="178"></A>the magistrates, if he be a slave or a metic, shall have the adulterated 
<A NAME="179"></A>goods; but if he be a citizen, and do not pursue the charge, he shall be 
<A NAME="180"></A>called a rogue, and deemed to have robbed the Gods of the agora; or if 
<A NAME="181"></A>he proves the charge, he shall dedicate the goods to the Gods of the agora. 
<A NAME="182"></A>He who is proved to have sold any adulterated goods, in addition to losing 
<A NAME="183"></A>the goods themselves, shall be beaten with stripes-a stripe for a drachma, 
<A NAME="184"></A>according to the price of the goods; and the herald shall proclaim in the 
<A NAME="185"></A>agora the offence for which he is going to be beaten. The warden of the 
<A NAME="186"></A>agora and the guardians of the law shall obtain information from experienced 
<A NAME="187"></A>persons about the rogueries and adulterations of the sellers, and shall 
<A NAME="188"></A>write up what the seller ought and ought not to do in each case; and let 
<A NAME="189"></A>them inscribe their laws on a column in front of the court of the wardens 
<A NAME="190"></A>of the agora, that they may be clear instructors of those who have business 
<A NAME="191"></A>in the agora. Enough has been said in what has preceded about the wardens 
<A NAME="192"></A>of the city, and if anything seems to be wanting, let them communicate 
<A NAME="193"></A>with the guardians of the law, and write down the omission, and place on 
<A NAME="194"></A>a column in the court of the wardens of the city the primary and secondary 
<A NAME="195"></A>regulations which are laid down for them about their 
<A NAME="196"></A>office.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>After the practices of adulteration naturally follow the practices 
<A NAME="198"></A>of retail trade. Concerning these, we will first of all give a word of 
<A NAME="199"></A>counsel and reason, and the law shall come afterwards. Retail trade in 
<A NAME="200"></A>a city is not by nature intended to do any harm, but quite the contrary; 
<A NAME="201"></A>for is not he a benefactor who reduces the inequalities and incommensurabilities 
<A NAME="202"></A>of goods to equality and common measure? And this is what the power of 
<A NAME="203"></A>money accomplishes, and the merchant may be said to be appointed for this 
<A NAME="204"></A>purpose. The hireling and the tavern-keeper, and many other occupations, 
<A NAME="205"></A>some of them more and others less seemly-alike have this object;-they seek 
<A NAME="206"></A>to satisfy our needs and equalize our possessions. Let us then endeavour 
<A NAME="207"></A>to see what has brought retail trade into ill-odour, and wherein, lies 
<A NAME="208"></A>the dishonour and unseemliness of it, in order that if not entirely, we 
<A NAME="209"></A>may yet partially, cure the evil by legislation. To effect this is no easy 
<A NAME="210"></A>matter, and requires a great deal of virtue.
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR><B>Cleinias.</B> What do you mean?
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>Athenian Stranger. Dear Cleinias, the class of men is small-they must 
<A NAME="213"></A>have been rarely gifted by nature, and trained by education-who, when assailed 
<A NAME="214"></A>by wants and desires, are able to hold out and observe moderation, and 
<A NAME="215"></A>when they might make a great deal of money are sober in their wishes, and 
<A NAME="216"></A>prefer a moderate to a large gain. But the mass of mankind are the very 
<A NAME="217"></A>opposite: their desires are unbounded, and when they might gain in moderation 
<A NAME="218"></A>they prefer gains without limit; wherefore all that relates to retail trade, 
<A NAME="219"></A>and merchandise, and the keeping of taverns, is denounced and numbered 
<A NAME="220"></A>among dishonourable things. For if what I trust may never be and will not 
<A NAME="221"></A>be, we were to compel, if I may venture to say a ridiculous thing, the 
<A NAME="222"></A>best men everywhere to keep taverns for a time, or carry on retail trade, 
<A NAME="223"></A>or do anything of that sort; or if, in consequence of some fate or necessity, 
<A NAME="224"></A>the best women were compelled to follow similar callings, then we should 
<A NAME="225"></A>know how agreeable and pleasant all these things are; and if all such occupations 
<A NAME="226"></A>were managed on incorrupt principles, they would be honoured as we honour 
<A NAME="227"></A>a mother or a nurse. But now that a man goes to desert places and builds 
<A NAME="228"></A>bouses which can only be reached be long journeys, for the sake of retail 
<A NAME="229"></A>trade, and receives strangers who are in need at the welcome resting-place, 
<A NAME="230"></A>and gives them peace and calm when they are tossed by the storm, or cool 
<A NAME="231"></A>shade in the heat; and then instead of behaving to them as friends, and 
<A NAME="232"></A>showing the duties of hospitality to his guests, treats them as enemies 
<A NAME="233"></A>and captives who are at his mercy, and will not release them until they 
<A NAME="234"></A>have paid the most unjust, abominable, and extortionate ransom-these are 
<A NAME="235"></A>the sort of practices, and foul evils they are, which cast a reproach upon 
<A NAME="236"></A>the succour of adversity. And the legislator ought always to be devising 
<A NAME="237"></A>a remedy for evils of this nature. There is an ancient saying, which is 
<A NAME="238"></A>also a true one-"To fight against two opponents is a difficult thing," 
<A NAME="239"></A>as is seen in diseases and in many other cases. And in this case also the 
<A NAME="240"></A>war is against two enemies-wealth and poverty; one of whom corrupts the 
<A NAME="241"></A>soul of man with luxury, while the other drives him by pain into utter 
<A NAME="242"></A>shamelessness. What remedy can a city of sense find against this disease? 
<A NAME="243"></A>In the first place, they must have as few retail traders as possible; and 
<A NAME="244"></A>in the second place, they must assign the occupation to that class of men 
<A NAME="245"></A>whose corruption will be the least injury to the state; and in the third 
<A NAME="246"></A>place, they must devise some way whereby the followers of these occupations 
<A NAME="247"></A>themselves will not readily fall into habits of unbridled shamelessness 
<A NAME="248"></A>and meanness.
<A NAME="249"></A><BR><BR>After this preface let our law run as follows, and may fortune 
<A NAME="250"></A>favour us:-No landowner among the Magnetes, whose city the God is restoring 
<A NAME="251"></A>and resettling-no one, that is, of the 5040 families, shall become a retail 
<A NAME="252"></A>trader either voluntarily or involuntarily; neither shall he be a merchant, 
<A NAME="253"></A>or do any service for private persons unless they equally serve him, except 
<A NAME="254"></A>for his father or his mother, and their fathers and mothers; and in general 
<A NAME="255"></A>for his elders who are freemen, and whom he serves as a freeman. Now it 
<A NAME="256"></A>is difficult to determine accurately the things which are worthy or unworthy 
<A NAME="257"></A>of a freeman, but let those who have obtained the prize of virtue give 
<A NAME="258"></A>judgment about them in accordance with their feelings of right and wrong. 
<A NAME="259"></A>He who in any way shares in the illiberality of retail trades may be indicted 
<A NAME="260"></A>for dishonouring his race by any one who likes, before those who have been 
<A NAME="261"></A>judged to be the first in virtue; and if he appear to throw dirt upon his 
<A NAME="262"></A>father's house by an unworthy occupation, let him be imprisoned for a year 
<A NAME="263"></A>and abstain from that sort of thing; and if he repeat the offence, for 
<A NAME="264"></A>two years; and every time that he is convicted let the length of his imprisonment 
<A NAME="265"></A>be doubled. This shall be the second law:-He who engages in retail trade 
<A NAME="266"></A>must be either a metic or a stranger. And a third law shall be:-In order 
<A NAME="267"></A>that the retail trader who dwells in our city may be as good or as little 
<A NAME="268"></A>bad as possible, the guardians of the law shall remember that they are 
<A NAME="269"></A>not only guardians of those who may be easily watched and prevented from 
<A NAME="270"></A>becoming lawless or bad, because they are wellborn and bred; but still 
<A NAME="271"></A>more should they have a watch over those who are of another sort, and follow 
<A NAME="272"></A>pursuits which have a very strong tendency to make men bad. And, therefore, 
<A NAME="273"></A>in respect of the multifarious occupations of retail trade, that is to 
<A NAME="274"></A>say, in respect of such of them as are allowed to remain, because they 
<A NAME="275"></A>seem to be quite necessary in a state-about these the guardians of the 
<A NAME="276"></A>law should meet and take counsel with those who have experience of the 
<A NAME="277"></A>several kinds of retail trade, as we before commanded, concerning adulteration 
<A NAME="278"></A>(which is a matter akin to this), and when they meet they shall consider 
<A NAME="279"></A>what amount of receipts, after deducting expenses, will produce a moderate 
<A NAME="280"></A>gain to the retail trades, and they shall fix in writing and strictly maintain 
<A NAME="281"></A>what they find to be the right percentage of profit; this shall be seen 
<A NAME="282"></A>to by the wardens of the agora, and by the wardens of the city, and by 
<A NAME="283"></A>the wardens of the country. And so retail trade will benefit every one, 
<A NAME="284"></A>and do the least possible injury to those in the state who practise 
<A NAME="285"></A>it.
<A NAME="286"></A><BR><BR>When a man makes an agreement which he does not fulfil, unless 
<A NAME="287"></A>the agreement be of a nature which the law or a vote of the assembly does 
<A NAME="288"></A>not allow, or which he has made under the influence of some unjust compulsion, 
<A NAME="289"></A>or which he is prevented from fulfilling against his will by some unexpected 
<A NAME="290"></A>chance, the other party may go to law with him in the courts of the tribes, 
<A NAME="291"></A>for not having completed his agreement, if the parties are not able previously 
<A NAME="292"></A>to come to terms before arbiters or before their neighbours. The class 
<A NAME="293"></A>of craftsmen who have furnished human life with the arts is dedicated to 
<A NAME="294"></A>Hephaestus and Athene; and there is a class of craftsmen who preserve the 
<A NAME="295"></A>works of all craftsmen by arts of defence, the votaries of Ares and Athene, 
<A NAME="296"></A>to which divinities they too are rightly dedicated. All these continue 
<A NAME="297"></A>through life serving the country and the people; some of them are leaders 
<A NAME="298"></A>in battle; others make for hire implements and works, and they ought not 
<A NAME="299"></A>to deceive in such matters, out of respect to the Gods who are their ancestors. 
<A NAME="300"></A>If any craftsman through indolence omit to execute his work in a given 
<A NAME="301"></A>time, not reverencing the God who gives him the means of life, but considering, 
<A NAME="302"></A>foolish fellow, that he is his own God and will let him off easily, in 
<A NAME="303"></A>the first place, he shall suffer at the hands of the God, and in the second 
<A NAME="304"></A>place, the law shall follow in a similar spirit. He shall owe to him who 
<A NAME="305"></A>contracted with him the price of the works which he has failed in performing, 
<A NAME="306"></A>and he shall begin again and execute them gratis in the given time. When 
<A NAME="307"></A>a man undertakes a work, the law gives him the same advice which was given 
<A NAME="308"></A>to the seller, that he should not attempt to raise the price, but simply 
<A NAME="309"></A>ask the value; this the law enjoins also on the contractor; for the craftsman 
<A NAME="310"></A>assuredly knows the value of his work. Wherefore, in free states the man 
<A NAME="311"></A>of art ought not to attempt to impose upon private individuals by the help 
<A NAME="312"></A>of his art, which is by nature a true thing; and he who is wronged in a 
<A NAME="313"></A>matter of this sort, shall have a right of action against the party who 
<A NAME="314"></A>has wronged him. And if any one lets out work to a craftsman, and does 
<A NAME="315"></A>not pay him duly according to the lawful agreement, disregarding Zeus the 
<A NAME="316"></A>guardian of the city and Athene, who are the partners of the state, and 
<A NAME="317"></A>overthrows the foundations of society for the sake of a little gain, in 
<A NAME="318"></A>his case let the law and the Gods maintain the common bonds of the state. 
<A NAME="319"></A>And let him who, having already received the work in exchange, does not 
<A NAME="320"></A>pay the price in the time agreed, pay double the price; and if a year has 
<A NAME="321"></A>elapsed, although interest is not to be taken on loans, yet for every drachma 
<A NAME="322"></A>which he owes to the contractor let him pay a monthly interest of an obol. 
<A NAME="323"></A>Suits about these matters are to be decided by the courts of the tribes; 
<A NAME="324"></A>and by the way, since we have mentioned craftsmen at all, we must not forget 
<A NAME="325"></A>the other craft of war, in which generals and tacticians are the craftsmen, 
<A NAME="326"></A>who undertake voluntarily the work of our safety, as other craftsmen undertake 
<A NAME="327"></A>other public works;-if they execute their work well the law will never 
<A NAME="328"></A>tire of praising him who gives them those honours which are the just rewards 
<A NAME="329"></A>of the soldier; but if any one, having already received the benefit of 
<A NAME="330"></A>any noble service in war, does not make the due return of honour, the law 
<A NAME="331"></A>will blame him. Let this then be the law, having an ingredient of praise, 
<A NAME="332"></A>not compelling but advising the great body of the citizens to honour the 
<A NAME="333"></A>brave men who are the saviours of the whole state, whether by their courage 
<A NAME="334"></A>or by their military skill;-they should honour them, I say, in the second 
<A NAME="335"></A>place; for the first and highest tribute of respect is to be given to those 
<A NAME="336"></A>who are able above other men to honour the words of good 
<A NAME="337"></A>legislators.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR>The greater part of the dealings between man and man have been 
<A NAME="339"></A>now regulated by us with the exception of those that relate to orphans 
<A NAME="340"></A>and the supervision of orphans by their guardians. These follow next in 
<A NAME="341"></A>order, and must be regulated in some way. But to arrive at them we must 
<A NAME="342"></A>begin with the testamentary wishes of the dying and the case of those who 
<A NAME="343"></A>may have happened to die intestate. When I said, Cleinias, that we must 
<A NAME="344"></A>regulate them, I had in my mind the difficulty and perplexity in which 
<A NAME="345"></A>all such matters are involved. You cannot leave them unregulated, for individuals 
<A NAME="346"></A>would make regulations at variance with one another, and repugnant to the 
<A NAME="347"></A>laws and habits of the living and to their own previous habits, if a person 
<A NAME="348"></A>were simply allowed to make any will which he pleased, and this were to 
<A NAME="349"></A>take effect in whatever state he may have been at the end of his life; 
<A NAME="350"></A>for most of us lose our senses in a manner, and feel crushed when we think 
<A NAME="351"></A>that we are about to die.
<A NAME="352"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What do you mean, Stranger?
<A NAME="353"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> O Cleinias, a man when he is about to die is an intractable 
<A NAME="354"></A>creature, and is apt to use language which causes a great deal of anxiety 
<A NAME="355"></A>and trouble to the legislator.
<A NAME="356"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> In what way?
<A NAME="357"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> He wants to have the entire control of all his property, 
<A NAME="358"></A>and will use angry words.
<A NAME="359"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Such as what?
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> O ye Gods, he will say, how monstrous that I am not allowed 
<A NAME="361"></A>to give, or not to give my own to whom I will-less to him who has been 
<A NAME="362"></A>bad to me, and more to him who has been good to me, and whose badness and 
<A NAME="363"></A>goodness have been tested by me in time of sickness or in old age and in 
<A NAME="364"></A>every other sort of fortune!
<A NAME="365"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Well Stranger, and may he not very fairly say 
<A NAME="366"></A>so?
<A NAME="367"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> In my opinion, Cleinias, the ancient legislators were too 
<A NAME="368"></A>good-natured, and made laws without sufficient observation or consideration 
<A NAME="369"></A>of human things.
<A NAME="370"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What do you mean?
<A NAME="371"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I mean, my friend that they were afraid of the testator's 
<A NAME="372"></A>reproaches, and so they passed a law to the effect that a man should be 
<A NAME="373"></A>allowed to dispose of his property in all respects as he liked; but you 
<A NAME="374"></A>and I, if I am not mistaken, will have something better to say to our departing 
<A NAME="375"></A>citizens.
<A NAME="376"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What?
<A NAME="377"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> O my friends, we will say to them, hard is it for you, 
<A NAME="378"></A>who are creatures of a day, to know what is yours-hard too, as the Delphic 
<A NAME="379"></A>oracle says, to know yourselves at this hour. Now I, as the legislator, 
<A NAME="380"></A>regard you and your possessions, not as belonging to yourselves, but as 
<A NAME="381"></A>belonging to your whole family, both past and future, and yet more do regard 
<A NAME="382"></A>both family and possessions as belonging to the state; wherefore, if some 
<A NAME="383"></A>one steals upon you with flattery, when you are tossed on the sea of disease 
<A NAME="384"></A>or old age, and persuades you to dispose of your property in a way that 
<A NAME="385"></A>is not for the best, I will not, if I can help, allow this; but I will 
<A NAME="386"></A>legislate with a view to the whole, considering what is best both for the 
<A NAME="387"></A>state and for the family, esteeming as I ought the feelings of an individual 
<A NAME="388"></A>at a lower rate; and I hope that you will depart in peace and kindness 
<A NAME="389"></A>towards us, as you are going the way of all mankind; and we will impartially 
<A NAME="390"></A>take care of all your concerns, not neglecting any of them, if we can possibly 
<A NAME="391"></A>help. Let this be our prelude and consolation to the living and dying, 
<A NAME="392"></A>Cleinias, and let the law be as follows:
<A NAME="393"></A><BR><BR>He who makes a disposition in a testament, if he be the father 
<A NAME="394"></A>of a family, shall first of all inscribe as his heir any one of his sons 
<A NAME="395"></A>whom he may think fit; and if he gives any of his children to be adopted 
<A NAME="396"></A>by another citizen, let the adoption be inscribed. And if he has a son 
<A NAME="397"></A>remaining over and above who has not been adopted upon any lot, and who 
<A NAME="398"></A>may be expected to be sent out to a colony according to law, to him his 
<A NAME="399"></A>father may give as much as he pleases of the rest of his property, with 
<A NAME="400"></A>the exception of the paternal lot and the fixtures on the lot. And if there 
<A NAME="401"></A>are other sons, let him distribute among them what there is more than the 
<A NAME="402"></A>lot in such portions as he pleases. And if one of the sons has already 
<A NAME="403"></A>a house of his own, he shall not give him of the money, nor shall he give 
<A NAME="404"></A>money to a daughter who has been betrothed, but if she is not betrothed 
<A NAME="405"></A>he may give her money. And if any of the sons or daughters shall be found 
<A NAME="406"></A>to have another lot of land in the country, which has accrued after the 
<A NAME="407"></A>testament has been made, they shall leave the lot which they have inherited 
<A NAME="408"></A>to the heir of the man who has made the will. If the testator has no sons, 
<A NAME="409"></A>but only daughters, let him choose the husband of any one of his daughters 
<A NAME="410"></A>whom he pleases, and leave and inscribe him as his son and heir. And if 
<A NAME="411"></A>a man have lost his son, when he was a child, and before he could be reckoned 
<A NAME="412"></A>among grown-up men, whether his own or an adopted son, let the testator 
<A NAME="413"></A>make mention of the circumstance and inscribe whom he will to be his second 
<A NAME="414"></A>son in hope of better fortune. If the testator has no children at all, 
<A NAME="415"></A>he may select and give to any one whom he pleases the tenth part of the 
<A NAME="416"></A>property which he has acquired; but let him not be blamed if he gives all 
<A NAME="417"></A>the rest to his adopted son, and makes a friend of him according to the 
<A NAME="418"></A>law. If the sons of a man require guardians, and: the father when he dies 
<A NAME="419"></A>leaves a will appointing guardians, those have been named by him, whoever 
<A NAME="420"></A>they are and whatever their number be, if they are able and willing to 
<A NAME="421"></A>take charge of the children, shall be recognized according to the provisions 
<A NAME="422"></A>of the will. But if he dies and has made no will, or a will in which he 
<A NAME="423"></A>has appointed no guardians, then the next of kin, two on the father's and 
<A NAME="424"></A>two on the mother's side, and one of the friends of the deceased, shall 
<A NAME="425"></A>have the authority of guardians, whom the guardians of the law shall appoint 
<A NAME="426"></A>when the orphans require guardians. And the fifteen eldest guardians of 
<A NAME="427"></A>the law shall have the whole care and charge of the orphans, divided into 
<A NAME="428"></A>threes according to seniority-a body of three for one year, and then another 
<A NAME="429"></A>body of three for the next year, until the cycle of the five periods is 
<A NAME="430"></A>complete; and this, as far as possible, is to continue always. If a man 
<A NAME="431"></A>dies, having made no will at all, and leaves sons who require the care 
<A NAME="432"></A>of guardians, they shall share in the protection which is afforded by these 
<A NAME="433"></A>laws.
<A NAME="434"></A><BR><BR>And if a man dying by some unexpected fate leaves daughters behind 
<A NAME="435"></A>him, let him pardon the legislator if he gives them in marriage, he have 
<A NAME="436"></A>a regard only to two out of three conditions-nearness of kin and the preservation 
<A NAME="437"></A>of the lot, and omits the third condition, which a father would naturally 
<A NAME="438"></A>consider, for he would choose out of all the citizens a son for himself, 
<A NAME="439"></A>and a husband for his daughter, with a view to his character and disposition-the 
<A NAME="440"></A>father, say, shall forgive the legislator if he disregards this, which 
<A NAME="441"></A>to him is an impossible consideration. Let the law about these matters 
<A NAME="442"></A>where practicable be as follows:-If a man dies without making a will, and 
<A NAME="443"></A>leaves behind him daughters, let his brother, being the son of the same 
<A NAME="444"></A>father or of the same mother, having no lot, marry the daughter and have 
<A NAME="445"></A>the lot of the dead man. And if he have no brother, but only a brother's 
<A NAME="446"></A>son, in like manner let them marry, if they be of a suitable age; and if 
<A NAME="447"></A>there be not even a brother's son, but only the son of a sister, let them 
<A NAME="448"></A>do likewise, and so in the fourth degree, if there be only the testator's 
<A NAME="449"></A>father's brother, or in the fifth degree, his father's brother's son, or 
<A NAME="450"></A>in the sixth degree, the child of his father's sister. Let kindred be always 
<A NAME="451"></A>reckoned in this way: if a person leaves daughters the relationship shall 
<A NAME="452"></A>proceed upwards through brothers and sisters, and brothers' and sisters' 
<A NAME="453"></A>children, and first the males shall come, and after them the females in 
<A NAME="454"></A>the same family. The judge shall consider and determine the suitableness 
<A NAME="455"></A>or unsuitableness of age in marriage; he shall make an inspection of the 
<A NAME="456"></A>males naked, and of the women naked down to the navel. And if there be 
<A NAME="457"></A>a lack of kinsmen in a family extending to grandchildren of a brother, 
<A NAME="458"></A>or to the grandchildren of a grandfather's children, the maiden may choose 
<A NAME="459"></A>with the consent of her guardians any one of the citizens who is willing 
<A NAME="460"></A>and whom she wills, and he shall be the heir of the dead man, and the husband 
<A NAME="461"></A>of his daughter. Circumstances vary, and there may sometimes be a still 
<A NAME="462"></A>greater lack of relations within the limits of the state; and if any maiden 
<A NAME="463"></A>has no kindred living in the city, and there is some one who has been sent 
<A NAME="464"></A>out to a colony, and she is disposed to make him the heir of her father's 
<A NAME="465"></A>possessions, if he be indeed of her kindred, let him proceed to take the 
<A NAME="466"></A>lot according to the regulation of the law; but if he be not of her kindred, 
<A NAME="467"></A>she having no kinsmen within the city, and he be chosen by the daughter 
<A NAME="468"></A>of the dead man, and empowered to marry by the guardians, let him return 
<A NAME="469"></A>home and take the lot of him who died intestate. And if a man has no children, 
<A NAME="470"></A>either male or female, and dies without making a will, let the previous 
<A NAME="471"></A>law in general hold; and let a man and a woman go forth from the family 
<A NAME="472"></A>and share the deserted house, and let the lot belong absolutely to them; 
<A NAME="473"></A>and let the heiress in the first degree be a sister, and in a second degree 
<A NAME="474"></A>a daughter of a brother, and in the third, a daughter of a sister, in the 
<A NAME="475"></A>fourth degree the sister of a father, and in the fifth degree the daughter 
<A NAME="476"></A>of a father's brother, and in a sixth degree of a father's sister; and 
<A NAME="477"></A>these shall dwell with their male kinsmen, according to the degree of relationship 
<A NAME="478"></A>and right, as we enacted before. Now we must not conceal from ourselves 
<A NAME="479"></A>that such laws are apt to be oppressive and that there may sometimes be 
<A NAME="480"></A>a hardship in the lawgiver commanding the kinsman of the dead man to marry 
<A NAME="481"></A>his relation; be may be thought not to have considered the innumerable 
<A NAME="482"></A>hindrances which may arise among men in the execution of such ordinances; 
<A NAME="483"></A>for there may be cases in which the parties refuse to obey, and are ready 
<A NAME="484"></A>to do anything rather than marry, when there is some bodily or mental malady 
<A NAME="485"></A>or defect among those who are bidden to marry or be married. Persons may 
<A NAME="486"></A>fancy that the legislator never thought of this, but they are mistaken; 
<A NAME="487"></A>wherefore let us make a common prelude on behalf of the lawgiver and of 
<A NAME="488"></A>his subjects, the law begging the latter to forgive the legislator, in 
<A NAME="489"></A>that he, having to take care of the common weal, cannot order at the same 
<A NAME="490"></A>time the various circumstances of individuals, and begging him to pardon 
<A NAME="491"></A>them if naturally they are sometimes unable to fulfil the act which he 
<A NAME="492"></A>in his ignorance imposes upon them.
<A NAME="493"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> And how, Stranger, can we act most fairly under the 
<A NAME="494"></A>circumstances?
<A NAME="495"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> There must be arbiters chosen to deal with such laws 
<A NAME="496"></A>and the subjects of them.
<A NAME="497"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What do you mean?
<A NAME="498"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I mean to say, that a case may occur in which the nephew, 
<A NAME="499"></A>having a rich father, will be unwilling to marry the daughter of his uncle; 
<A NAME="500"></A>he will have a feeling of pride, and he will wish to look higher. And there 
<A NAME="501"></A>are cases in which the legislator will be imposing upon him the greatest 
<A NAME="502"></A>calamity, and he will be compelled to disobey the law, if he is required, 
<A NAME="503"></A>for example, to take a wife who is mad, or has some other terrible malady 
<A NAME="504"></A>of soul or body, such as makes life intolerable to the sufferer. Then let 
<A NAME="505"></A>what we are saying concerning these cases be embodied in a law:-If any 
<A NAME="506"></A>one finds fault with the established laws respecting testaments, both as 
<A NAME="507"></A>to other matters and especially in what relates to marriage, and asserts 
<A NAME="508"></A>that the legislator, if he were alive and present, would not compel him 
<A NAME="509"></A>to obey-that is to say, would not compel those who are by our law required 
<A NAME="510"></A>to marry or be given in marriage, to do either-and some kinsman or guardian 
<A NAME="511"></A>dispute this, the reply is that the legislator left fifteen of the guardians 
<A NAME="512"></A>of the law to be arbiters and fathers of orphans, male or female, and to 
<A NAME="513"></A>them let the disputants have recourse, and by their aid determine any matters 
<A NAME="514"></A>of the kind, admitting their decision to be final. But if any one thinks 
<A NAME="515"></A>that too great power is thus given to the guardians of the law, let him 
<A NAME="516"></A>bring his adversaries into the court of the select judges, and there have 
<A NAME="517"></A>the points in dispute determined. And he who loses the cause shall have 
<A NAME="518"></A>censure and blame from the legislator, which, by a man of sense, is felt 
<A NAME="519"></A>to be a penalty far heavier than a great loss of money.
<A NAME="520"></A><BR><BR>Thus will orphan children have a second birth. After their first 
<A NAME="521"></A>birth we spoke of their nurture and education, and after their second birth, 
<A NAME="522"></A>when they have lost their parents, we ought to take measures that the misfortune 
<A NAME="523"></A>of orphanhood may be as little sad to them as possible. In the first place, 
<A NAME="524"></A>we say that the guardians of the law are lawgivers and fathers to them, 
<A NAME="525"></A>not inferior to their natural fathers. Moreover, they shall take charge 
<A NAME="526"></A>of them year by year as of their own kindred; and we have given both to 
<A NAME="527"></A>them and to the children's own guardians a suitable admonition concerning 
<A NAME="528"></A>the nurture of orphans. And we seem to have spoken opportunely in our former 
<A NAME="529"></A>discourse, when we said that the souls of the dead have the power after 
<A NAME="530"></A>death of taking an interest in human affairs, about which there are many 
<A NAME="531"></A>tales and traditions, long indeed, but true; and seeing that they are so 
<A NAME="532"></A>many and so ancient, we must believe them, and we must also believe the 
<A NAME="533"></A>lawgivers, who tell us that these things are true, if they are not to be 
<A NAME="534"></A>regarded as utter fools. But if these things are really so, in the first 
<A NAME="535"></A>place men should have a fear of the Gods above, who regard the loneliness 
<A NAME="536"></A>of the orphans; and in the second place of the souls of the departed, who 
<A NAME="537"></A>by nature incline to take an especial care of their own children, and are 
<A NAME="538"></A>friendly to those who honour, and unfriendly to those who dishonour them. 
<A NAME="539"></A>Men should also fear the souls of the living who are aged and high in honour; 
<A NAME="540"></A>wherever a city is well ordered and prosperous, their descendants cherish 
<A NAME="541"></A>them, and so live happily; old persons are quick to see and hear all that 
<A NAME="542"></A>relates to them, and are propitious to those who are just in the fulfilment 
<A NAME="543"></A>of such duties, and they punish those who wrong the orphan and the desolate, 
<A NAME="544"></A>considering that they are the greatest and most sacred of trusts. To all 
<A NAME="545"></A>which matters the guardian and magistrate ought to apply his mind, if he 
<A NAME="546"></A>has any, and take heed of the nurture and education of the orphans, seeking 
<A NAME="547"></A>in every possible way to do them good, for he is making a contribution 
<A NAME="548"></A>to his own good and that of his children. He who obeys the tale which precedes 
<A NAME="549"></A>the law, and does no wrong to an orphan, will never experience the wrath 
<A NAME="550"></A>of the legislator. But he who is disobedient, and wrongs any one who is 
<A NAME="551"></A>bereft of father or mother, shall pay twice the penalty which he would 
<A NAME="552"></A>have paid if he had wronged one whose parents had been alive. As touching 
<A NAME="553"></A>other legislation concerning guardians in their relation to orphans, or 
<A NAME="554"></A>concerning magistrates and their superintendence of the guardians, if they 
<A NAME="555"></A>did not possess examples of the manner in which children of freemen should 
<A NAME="556"></A>be brought up in the bringing up of their own children, and of the care 
<A NAME="557"></A>of their property in the care of their own, or if they had not just laws 
<A NAME="558"></A>fairly stated about these very things-there would have been reason in making 
<A NAME="559"></A>laws for them, under the idea that they were a peculiar-class, and we might 
<A NAME="560"></A>distinguish and make separate rules for the life of those who are orphans 
<A NAME="561"></A>and of those who are not orphans. But as the case stands, the condition 
<A NAME="562"></A>of orphans with us not different from the case of those who have father, 
<A NAME="563"></A>though in regard to honour and dishonour, and the attention given to them, 
<A NAME="564"></A>the two are not usually placed upon a level. Wherefore, touching the legislation 
<A NAME="565"></A>about orphans, the law speaks in serious accents, both of persuasion and 
<A NAME="566"></A>threatening, and such a threat as the following will be by no means out 
<A NAME="567"></A>of place:-He who is the guardian of an orphan of either sex, and he among 
<A NAME="568"></A>the guardians of the law to whom the superintendence of this guardian has 
<A NAME="569"></A>been assigned, shall love the unfortunate orphan as though he were his 
<A NAME="570"></A>own child, and he shall be as careful and diligent in the management of 
<A NAME="571"></A>his possessions as he would be if they were his own, or even more careful 
<A NAME="572"></A>and dilligent. Let every one who has the care of an orphan observe this 
<A NAME="573"></A>law. But any one who acts contrary to the law on these matters, if he be 
<A NAME="574"></A>a guardian of the child, may be fined by a magistrate, or, if he be himself 
<A NAME="575"></A>a magistrate, the guardian may bring him before the court of select judges, 
<A NAME="576"></A>and punish him, if convicted, by exacting a fine of double the amount of 
<A NAME="577"></A>that inflicted by the court. And if a guardian appears to the relations 
<A NAME="578"></A>of the orphan, or to any other citizen, to act negligently or dishonestly, 
<A NAME="579"></A>let them bring him before the same court, and whatever damages are given 
<A NAME="580"></A>against him, let him pay fourfold, and let half belong to the orphan and 
<A NAME="581"></A>half to him who procured the conviction. If any orphan arrives at years 
<A NAME="582"></A>of discretion, and thinks that he has been ill-used by his guardians, let 
<A NAME="583"></A>him within five years of the expiration of the guardianship be allowed 
<A NAME="584"></A>to bring them to trial; and if any of them be convicted, the court shall 
<A NAME="585"></A>determine what he shall pay or suffer. And if magistrate shall appear to 
<A NAME="586"></A>have wronged the orphan by neglect, and he be convicted, let the court 
<A NAME="587"></A>determine what he shall suffer or pay to the orphan, and if there be dishonesty 
<A NAME="588"></A>in addition to neglect, besides paying the fine, let him be deposed from 
<A NAME="589"></A>his office of guardian of the law, and let the state appoint another guardian 
<A NAME="590"></A>of the law for the city and for the country in his room.
<A NAME="591"></A><BR><BR>Greater differences than there ought to be sometimes arise between 
<A NAME="592"></A>fathers and sons, on the part either of fathers who will be of opinion 
<A NAME="593"></A>that the legislator should enact that they may, if they wish, lawfully 
<A NAME="594"></A>renounce their son by the proclamation of a herald in the face of the world, 
<A NAME="595"></A>or of sons who think that they should be allowed to indict their fathers 
<A NAME="596"></A>on the charge of imbecility when they are disabled by disease or old age. 
<A NAME="597"></A>These things only happen, as a matter of fact, where the natures of men 
<A NAME="598"></A>are utterly bad; for where only half is bad, as, for example, if the father 
<A NAME="599"></A>be not bad, but the son be bad, or conversely, no great calamity is the 
<A NAME="600"></A>result of such an amount of hatred as this. In another state, a son disowned 
<A NAME="601"></A>by his father would not of necessity cease to be a citizen, but in our 
<A NAME="602"></A>state, of which these are to be the laws, the disinherited must necessarily 
<A NAME="603"></A>emigrate into another country, for no addition can be made even of a single 
<A NAME="604"></A>family to the 5040 households; and, therefore, he who deserves to suffer 
<A NAME="605"></A>these things must be renounced not only by his father, who is a single 
<A NAME="606"></A>person, but by the whole family, and what is done in these cases must be 
<A NAME="607"></A>regulated by some such law as the following:-He who in the sad disorder 
<A NAME="608"></A>of his soul has a mind, justly or unjustly, to expel from his family a 
<A NAME="609"></A>son whom he has begotten and brought up, shall not lightly or at once execute 
<A NAME="610"></A>his purpose; but first of all he shall collect together his own kinsmen 
<A NAME="611"></A>extending to cousins, and in like manner his son's kinsmen by the mother's 
<A NAME="612"></A>side, and in their presence he shall accuse his son, setting forth that 
<A NAME="613"></A>he deserves at the hands of them all to be dismissed from the family; and 
<A NAME="614"></A>the son shall be allowed to address them in a similar manner, and show 
<A NAME="615"></A>that he does not deserve to suffer any of these things. And if the father 
<A NAME="616"></A>persuades them, and obtains the suffrages of more than half of his kindred, 
<A NAME="617"></A>exclusive of the father and mother and the offender himself-I say, if he 
<A NAME="618"></A>obtains more than half the suffrages of all the other grown-up members 
<A NAME="619"></A>of the family, of both sexes, the father shall be permitted to put away 
<A NAME="620"></A>his son, but not otherwise. And if any other citizen is willing to adopt 
<A NAME="621"></A>the son who is put away, no law shall hinder him; for the characters of 
<A NAME="622"></A>young men are subject to many changes in the course of their lives. And 
<A NAME="623"></A>if he has been put away, and in a period of ten years no one is willing 
<A NAME="624"></A>to adopt him, let those who have the care of the superabundant population 
<A NAME="625"></A>which is sent out into colonies, see to him, in order that he may be suitably 
<A NAME="626"></A>provided for in the colony. And if disease or age or harshness of temper, 
<A NAME="627"></A>or all these together, makes a man to be more out of his mind than the 
<A NAME="628"></A>rest of the world are-but this is not observable, except to those who live 
<A NAME="629"></A>with him-and he, being master of his property, is the ruin of the house, 
<A NAME="630"></A>and his son doubts and hesitates about indicting his father for insanity, 
<A NAME="631"></A>let the law in that case or, that he shall first of all go to the eldest 
<A NAME="632"></A>guardians of the law and tell them of his father's misfortune, and they 
<A NAME="633"></A>shall duly look into the matter, and take counsel as to whether he shall 
<A NAME="634"></A>indict him or not. And if they advise him to proceed, they shall be both 
<A NAME="635"></A>his witnesses and his advocates; and if the father is cast, he shall henceforth 
<A NAME="636"></A>be incapable of ordering the least particular of his life; let him be as 
<A NAME="637"></A>a child dwelling in the house for the remainder of his days. And if a man 
<A NAME="638"></A>and his wife have an unfortunate incompatibility of temper, ten of the 
<A NAME="639"></A>guardians of the law, who are impartial, and ten of the women who regulate 
<A NAME="640"></A>marriages, shall look to the matter, and if they are able to reconcile 
<A NAME="641"></A>them they shall be formally reconciled; but if their souls are too much 
<A NAME="642"></A>tossed with passion, they shall endeavour to find other partners. Now they 
<A NAME="643"></A>are not likely to have very gentle tempers; and, therefore, we must endeavour 
<A NAME="644"></A>to associate with them deeper and softer natures. Those who have no children, 
<A NAME="645"></A>or only a few, at the time of their separation, should choose their new 
<A NAME="646"></A>partners with a view to the procreation of children; but those who have 
<A NAME="647"></A>a sufficient number of children should separate and marry again in order 
<A NAME="648"></A>that they may have some one to grow old with and that the pair may take 
<A NAME="649"></A>care of one another in age. If a woman dies, leaving children, male or 
<A NAME="650"></A>female, the law will advise rather than compel the husband to bring up 
<A NAME="651"></A>the children without introducing into the house a stepmother. But if he 
<A NAME="652"></A>have no children, then he shall be compelled to marry until he has begotten 
<A NAME="653"></A>a sufficient number of sons to his family and to the state. And if a man 
<A NAME="654"></A>dies leaving a sufficient number of children, the mother of his children 
<A NAME="655"></A>shall remain with them and bring, them up. But if she appears to be too 
<A NAME="656"></A>young to live virtuously without a husband, let her relations communicate 
<A NAME="657"></A>with the women who superintend marriage, and let both together do what 
<A NAME="658"></A>they think best in these matters; if there is a lack of children, let the 
<A NAME="659"></A>choice be made with a view to having them; two children, one of either 
<A NAME="660"></A>sex, shall be deemed sufficient in the eye of the law. When a child is 
<A NAME="661"></A>admitted to be the offspring of certain parents and is acknowledged by 
<A NAME="662"></A>them, but there is need of a decision as to which parent the child is to 
<A NAME="663"></A>follow-in case a female slave have intercourse with a male slave, or with 
<A NAME="664"></A>a freeman or freedman, the offspring shall always belong to the master 
<A NAME="665"></A>of the female slave. Again, if a free woman have intercourse with a male 
<A NAME="666"></A>slave, the offspring shall belong to the master of the slave; but if a 
<A NAME="667"></A>child be born either of a slave by her master, or of his mistress by a 
<A NAME="668"></A>slave-and this be provence offspring of the woman and its father shall 
<A NAME="669"></A>be sent away by the women who superintend marriage into another country, 
<A NAME="670"></A>and the guardians of the law shall send away the offspring of the man and 
<A NAME="671"></A>its mother.
<A NAME="672"></A><BR><BR>Neither God, nor a man who has understanding, will ever advise 
<A NAME="673"></A>any one to neglect his parents. To a discourse concerning the honour and 
<A NAME="674"></A>dishonour of parents, a prelude such as the following, about the service 
<A NAME="675"></A>of the Gods, will be a suitable introduction:-There are ancient customs 
<A NAME="676"></A>about the Gods which are universal, and they are of two kinds: some of 
<A NAME="677"></A>the Gods we see with our eyes and we honour them, of others we honour the 
<A NAME="678"></A>images, raising statues of them which we adore; and though they are lifeless, 
<A NAME="679"></A>yet we imagine that the living Gods have a good will and gratitude to us 
<A NAME="680"></A>on this account. Now, if a man has a father or mother, or their fathers 
<A NAME="681"></A>or mothers treasured up in his house stricken in years, let him consider 
<A NAME="682"></A>that no statue can be more potent to grant his requests than they are, 
<A NAME="683"></A>who are sitting at his hearth if only he knows how to show true service 
<A NAME="684"></A>to them.
<A NAME="685"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> And what do you call the true mode of 
<A NAME="686"></A>service?
<A NAME="687"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I will tell you, O my friend, for such things are worth 
<A NAME="688"></A>listening to.
<A NAME="689"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Proceed.
<A NAME="690"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Oedipus, as tradition says, when dishonoured by his sons, 
<A NAME="691"></A>invoked on them curses which every one declares to have been heard and 
<A NAME="692"></A>ratified by the Gods, and Amyntor in his wrath invoked curses on his son 
<A NAME="693"></A>Phoenix, and Theseus upon Hippolytus, and innumerable others have also 
<A NAME="694"></A>called down wrath upon their children, whence it is clear that the Gods 
<A NAME="695"></A>listen to the imprecations of parents; for the curses of parents are, as 
<A NAME="696"></A>they ought to be, mighty against their children as no others are. And shall 
<A NAME="697"></A>we suppose that the prayers of a father or mother who is specially dishonoured 
<A NAME="698"></A>by his or her children, are heard by the Gods in accordance with nature; 
<A NAME="699"></A>and that if a parent is honoured by them, and in the gladness of his heart 
<A NAME="700"></A>earnestly entreats the Gods in his prayers to do them good, he is not equally 
<A NAME="701"></A>heard, and that they do not minister to his request? If not, they would 
<A NAME="702"></A>be very unjust ministers of good, and that we affirm to be contrary to 
<A NAME="703"></A>their nature.
<A NAME="704"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="705"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> May we not think, as I was saying just now, that we can 
<A NAME="706"></A>possess no image which is more honoured by the Gods, than that of a father 
<A NAME="707"></A>or grandfather, or of a mother stricken in years? whom when a man honours, 
<A NAME="708"></A>the heart of the God rejoices, and he is ready to answer their prayers. 
<A NAME="709"></A>And, truly, the figure of an ancestor is a wonderful thing, far higher 
<A NAME="710"></A>than that of a lifeless image. For the living, when they are honoured by 
<A NAME="711"></A>us, join in our prayers, and when they are dishonoured, they utter imprecations 
<A NAME="712"></A>against us; but lifeless objects do neither. And therefore, if a man makes 
<A NAME="713"></A>a right use of his father and grandfather and other aged relations, he 
<A NAME="714"></A>will have images which above all others will win him the favour of the 
<A NAME="715"></A>Gods.
<A NAME="716"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Excellent.
<A NAME="717"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Every man of any understanding fears and respects the prayers 
<A NAME="718"></A>of parents, knowing well that many times and to many persons they have 
<A NAME="719"></A>been accomplished. Now these things being thus ordered by nature, good 
<A NAME="720"></A>men think it a blessing from heaven if their parents live to old age and 
<A NAME="721"></A>reach the utmost limit of human life, or if taken away before their time 
<A NAME="722"></A>they are deeply regretted by them; but to bad men parents are always a 
<A NAME="723"></A>cause of terror. Wherefore let every man honour with every sort of lawful 
<A NAME="724"></A>honour his own parents, agreeably to what has now been said. But if this 
<A NAME="725"></A>prelude be an unmeaning sound in the cars of any one, let the law follow, 
<A NAME="726"></A>which may be rightly imposed in these terms:-If any one in this city be 
<A NAME="727"></A>not sufficiently careful of his parents, and do not regard and gratify 
<A NAME="728"></A>in every respect their wishes more than those of his sons and of his other 
<A NAME="729"></A>offspring or of himself-let him who experiences this sort of treatment 
<A NAME="730"></A>either come himself, or send some one to inform the three eldest guardians 
<A NAME="731"></A>of the law, and three of the women who have the care of marriages; and 
<A NAME="732"></A>let them look to the matter and punish youthful evil-doers with stripes 
<A NAME="733"></A>and bonds if they are under thirty years of age, that is to say, if they 
<A NAME="734"></A>be men, or if they be women, let them undergo the same punishment up to 
<A NAME="735"></A>forty years of age. But if, when they are still more advanced in years, 
<A NAME="736"></A>they continue the same neglect of their parents, and do any hurt to any 
<A NAME="737"></A>of them, let them be brought before a court in which every single one of 
<A NAME="738"></A>the eldest citizens shall be the judges, and if the offender be convicted, 
<A NAME="739"></A>let the court determine what he ought to pay or suffer, and any penalty 
<A NAME="740"></A>may be imposed on him which a man can pay or suffer. If the person who 
<A NAME="741"></A>has been wronged be unable to inform the magistrates, let any freeman who 
<A NAME="742"></A>hears of his case inform, and if he do not, he shall be deemed base, and 
<A NAME="743"></A>shall be liable to have a suit for damage brought against him by any one 
<A NAME="744"></A>who likes. And if a slave inform, he shall receive freedom; and if he be 
<A NAME="745"></A>the slave of the injurer or injured party, he shall be set free by the 
<A NAME="746"></A>magistrates, or if he belong to any other citizen, the public shall pay 
<A NAME="747"></A>a price on his behalf to the owner; and let the magistrates take heed that 
<A NAME="748"></A>no one wrongs him out of revenge, because he has given 
<A NAME="749"></A>information.
<A NAME="750"></A><BR><BR>Cases in which one man injures another by poisons, and which prove 
<A NAME="751"></A>fatal, have been already discussed; but about other cases in which a person 
<A NAME="752"></A>intentionally and of malice harms another with meats, or drinks, or ointments, 
<A NAME="753"></A>nothing has as yet been determined. For there are two kinds of poisons 
<A NAME="754"></A>used among men, which cannot clearly be distinguished. There is the kind 
<A NAME="755"></A>just now explicitly mentioned, which injures bodies by the use of other 
<A NAME="756"></A>bodies according to a natural law; there is also another kind which persuades 
<A NAME="757"></A>the more daring class that they can do injury by sorceries, and incantations, 
<A NAME="758"></A>and magic knots, as they are termed, and makes others believe that they 
<A NAME="759"></A>above all persons are injured by the powers of the magician. Now it is 
<A NAME="760"></A>not easy to know the nature of all these things; nor if a man do know can 
<A NAME="761"></A>he readily persuade others to believe him. And when men are disturbed in 
<A NAME="762"></A>their minds at the sight of waxen images fixed either at their doors, or 
<A NAME="763"></A>in a place where three ways meet, or on the sepulchres of parents, there 
<A NAME="764"></A>is no use in trying to persuade them that they should despise all such 
<A NAME="765"></A>things because they have no certain knowledge about them. But we must have 
<A NAME="766"></A>a law in two parts, concerning poisoning, in whichever of the two ways 
<A NAME="767"></A>the attempt is made, and we must entreat, and exhort, and advise men not 
<A NAME="768"></A>to have recourse to such practices, by which they scare the multitude out 
<A NAME="769"></A>of their wits, as if they were children, compelling the legislator and 
<A NAME="770"></A>the judge to heal the fears which the sorcerer arouses, and to tell them 
<A NAME="771"></A>in the first place, that he who attempts to poison or enchant others knows 
<A NAME="772"></A>not what he is doing, either as regards the body (unless he has a knowledge 
<A NAME="773"></A>of medicine), or as regards his enchantments (unless he happens to be a 
<A NAME="774"></A>prophet or diviner). Let the law, then, run as follows about poisoning 
<A NAME="775"></A>or witchcraft:-He who employs poison to do any injury, not fatal, to a 
<A NAME="776"></A>man himself, or to his servants, or any injury, whether fatal or not, to 
<A NAME="777"></A>his cattle or his bees, if he be a physician, and be convicted of poisoning, 
<A NAME="778"></A>shall be punished with death; or if he be a private person, the court shall 
<A NAME="779"></A>determine what he is to pay or suffer. But he who seems to be the sort 
<A NAME="780"></A>of man injures others by magic knots, or enchantments, or incantations, 
<A NAME="781"></A>or any of the like practices, if he be a prophet or diviner, let him die; 
<A NAME="782"></A>and if, not being a prophet, he be convicted of witchcraft, as in the previous 
<A NAME="783"></A>case, let the court fix what he ought to pay or suffer.
<A NAME="784"></A><BR><BR>When a man does another any injury by theft or violence, for the 
<A NAME="785"></A>greater injury let him pay greater damages to the injured man, and less 
<A NAME="786"></A>for the smaller injury; but in all cases, whatever the injury may have 
<A NAME="787"></A>been, as much as will compensate the loss. And besides the compensation 
<A NAME="788"></A>of the wrong, let a man pay a further penalty for the chastisement of his 
<A NAME="789"></A>offence: he who has done the wrong instigated by the folly of another, 
<A NAME="790"></A>through the lightheartedness of youth or the like, shall pay a lighter 
<A NAME="791"></A>penalty; but he who has injured another through his own folly, when overcome 
<A NAME="792"></A>by pleasure or pain, in cowardly fear, or lust, or envy, or implacable 
<A NAME="793"></A>anger, shall endure a heavier punishment. Not that he is punished because 
<A NAME="794"></A>he did wrong, for that which is done can never be undone, but in order 
<A NAME="795"></A>that in future times, he, and those who see him corrected, may utterly 
<A NAME="796"></A>hate injustice, or at any rate abate much of their evil-doing. Having an 
<A NAME="797"></A>eye to all these things, the law, like a good archer, should aim at the 
<A NAME="798"></A>right measure of punishment, and in all cases at the deserved punishment. 
<A NAME="799"></A>In the attainment of this the judge shall be a fellow-worker with the legislator, 
<A NAME="800"></A>whenever the law leaves to him to determine what the offender shall suffer 
<A NAME="801"></A>or pay; and the legislator, like a painter, shall give a rough sketch of 
<A NAME="802"></A>the cases in which the law is to be applied. This is what we must do, Megillus 
<A NAME="803"></A>and Cleinias, in the best and fairest manner that we can, saying what the 
<A NAME="804"></A>punishments are to be of all actions of theft and violence, and giving 
<A NAME="805"></A>laws of such a kind as the Gods and sons of Gods would have us 
<A NAME="806"></A>give.
<A NAME="807"></A><BR><BR>If a man is mad he shall not be at large in the city, but his relations 
<A NAME="808"></A>shall keep him at home in any way which they can; or if not, let them pay 
<A NAME="809"></A>a penalty-he who is of the highest class shall pay a penalty of one hundred 
<A NAME="810"></A>drachmae, whether he be a slave or a freeman whom he neglects; and he of 
<A NAME="811"></A>the second class shall pay four-fifths of a mina; and he of the third class 
<A NAME="812"></A>three-fifths; and he of the fourth class two-fifths. Now there are many 
<A NAME="813"></A>sorts of madness, some arising out of disease, which we have already mentioned; 
<A NAME="814"></A>and there are other kinds, which originate in an evil and passionate temperament, 
<A NAME="815"></A>and are increased by bad education; out of a slight quarrel this class 
<A NAME="816"></A>of madmen will often raise a storm of abuse against one another, and nothing 
<A NAME="817"></A>of that sort ought to be allowed to occur in a well-ordered state. Let 
<A NAME="818"></A>this, then, be the law about abuse, which shall relate to all cases:-No 
<A NAME="819"></A>one shall speak evil of another; and when a man disputes with another he 
<A NAME="820"></A>shall teach and learn of the disputant and the company, but he shall abstain 
<A NAME="821"></A>from evilspeaking; for out of the imprecations which men utter against 
<A NAME="822"></A>one another, and the feminine habit of casting aspersions on one another, 
<A NAME="823"></A>and using foul names, out of words light as air, in very deed the greatest 
<A NAME="824"></A>enmities and hatreds spring up. For the speaker gratifies his anger, which 
<A NAME="825"></A>is an ungracious element of his nature; and nursing up his wrath by the 
<A NAME="826"></A>entertainment of evil thoughts, and exacerbating that part of his soul 
<A NAME="827"></A>which was formerly civilized by education, he lives in a state of savageness 
<A NAME="828"></A>and moroseness, and pays a bitter penalty for his anger. And in such cases 
<A NAME="829"></A>almost all men take to saying something ridiculous about their opponent, 
<A NAME="830"></A>and there is no man who is in the habit of laughing at another who does 
<A NAME="831"></A>not miss virtue and earnestness altogether, or lose the better half of 
<A NAME="832"></A>greatness. Wherefore let no one utter any taunting word at a temple, or 
<A NAME="833"></A>at the public sacrifices, or at games, or in the agora, or in a court of 
<A NAME="834"></A>justice, or in any public assembly. And let the magistrate who presides 
<A NAME="835"></A>on these occasions chastise an offender, and he shall be blameless; but 
<A NAME="836"></A>if he fails in doing so, he shall not claim the prize of virtue; for he 
<A NAME="837"></A>is one who heeds not the laws, and does not do what the legislator commands. 
<A NAME="838"></A>And if in any other place any one indulges in these sort of revilings, 
<A NAME="839"></A>whether he has begun the quarrel or is only retaliating, let any elder 
<A NAME="840"></A>who is present support the law, and control with blows those who indulge 
<A NAME="841"></A>in passion, which is another great evil; and if he do not, let him be liable 
<A NAME="842"></A>to pay the appointed penalty. And we say now, that he who deals in reproaches 
<A NAME="843"></A>against others cannot reproach them without attempting to ridicule them; 
<A NAME="844"></A>and this, when done in a moment of anger, is what we make matter of reproach 
<A NAME="845"></A>against him. But then, do we admit into our state the comic writers who 
<A NAME="846"></A>are so fond of making mankind ridiculous, if they attempt in a good-natured 
<A NAME="847"></A>manner to turn the laugh against our citizens? or do we draw the distinction 
<A NAME="848"></A>of jest and earnest, and allow a man to make use of ridicule in jest and 
<A NAME="849"></A>without anger about any thing or person; though as we were saying, not 
<A NAME="850"></A>if he be angry have a set purpose? We forbid earnest-that is unalterably 
<A NAME="851"></A>fixed; but we have still to say who are to be sanctioned or not to be sanctioned 
<A NAME="852"></A>by the law in the employment of innocent humour. A comic poet, or maker 
<A NAME="853"></A>of iambic or satirical lyric verse, shall not be permitted to ridicule 
<A NAME="854"></A>any of the citizens, either by word or likeness, either in anger or without 
<A NAME="855"></A>anger. And if any one is disobedient, the judges shall either at once expel 
<A NAME="856"></A>him from the country, or he shall pay a fine of three minae, which shall 
<A NAME="857"></A>be dedicated to the God who presides over the contests. Those only who 
<A NAME="858"></A>have received permission shall be allowed to write verses at one another, 
<A NAME="859"></A>but they shall be without anger and in jest; in anger and in serious earnest 
<A NAME="860"></A>they shall not be allowed. The decision of this matter shall be left to 
<A NAME="861"></A>the superintendent of the general education of the young, and whatever 
<A NAME="862"></A>he may license, the writer shall be allowed to produce, and whatever he 
<A NAME="863"></A>rejects let not the poet himself exhibit, or ever teach anybody else, slave 
<A NAME="864"></A>or freeman, under the penalty of being dishonoured, and held disobedient 
<A NAME="865"></A>to the laws.
<A NAME="866"></A><BR><BR>Now he is not to be pitied who is hungry, or who suffers any bodily 
<A NAME="867"></A>pain, but he who is temperate, or has some other virtue, or part of a virtue, 
<A NAME="868"></A>and at the same time suffers from misfortune; it would be an extraordinary 
<A NAME="869"></A>thing if such an one, whether slave or freeman, were utterly forsaken and 
<A NAME="870"></A>fell into the extremes of poverty in any tolerably well-ordered city or 
<A NAME="871"></A>government. Wherefore the legislator may safely make a law applicable to 
<A NAME="872"></A>such cases in the following terms:-Let there be no beggars in our state; 
<A NAME="873"></A>and if anybody begs, seeking to pick up a livelihood by unavailing prayers, 
<A NAME="874"></A>let the wardens of the agora turn him out of the agora, and the wardens 
<A NAME="875"></A>of the city out of the city, and the wardens of the country send him out 
<A NAME="876"></A>of any other parts of the land across the border, in order that the land 
<A NAME="877"></A>may be cleared of this sort of animal.
<A NAME="878"></A><BR><BR>If a slave of either sex injure anything, which is not his or her 
<A NAME="879"></A>own, through inexperience, or some improper practice, and the person who 
<A NAME="880"></A>suffers damage be not himself in part to blame, the master of the slave 
<A NAME="881"></A>who has done the harm shall either make full satisfaction, or give up the 
<A NAME="882"></A>the slave who has done has done the injury. But if master argue that the 
<A NAME="883"></A>charge has arisen by collusion between the injured party and the injurer, 
<A NAME="884"></A>with the view of obtaining the slave, let him sue the person, who says 
<A NAME="885"></A>that he has been injured, for malpractices. And if he gain a conviction, 
<A NAME="886"></A>let him receive double the value which the court fixes as the price of 
<A NAME="887"></A>the slave; and if he lose his suit, let him make amends for the injury, 
<A NAME="888"></A>and give up the slave. And if a beast of burden, or horse, or dog, or any 
<A NAME="889"></A>other animal, injure the property of a neighbour, the owner shall in like 
<A NAME="890"></A>manner pay for the injury.
<A NAME="891"></A><BR><BR>If any man refuses to be a witness, he who wants him shall summon 
<A NAME="892"></A>him, and he who is summoned shall come to the trial; and if he knows and 
<A NAME="893"></A>is willing to bear witness, let him bear witness, but if he says he does 
<A NAME="894"></A>not know let him swear by the three divinities Zeus, and Apollo, and Themis, 
<A NAME="895"></A>that he does not, and have no more to do with the cause. And he who is 
<A NAME="896"></A>summoned to give witness and does not answer to his summoner, shall be 
<A NAME="897"></A>liable for the harm which ensues according to law. And if a person calls 
<A NAME="898"></A>up as a witness any one who is acting as a judge, let him give his witness, 
<A NAME="899"></A>but he shall not afterwards vote in the cause. A free woman may give her 
<A NAME="900"></A>witness and plead, if she be more than forty years of age, and may bring 
<A NAME="901"></A>an action if she have no husband; but if her husband be alive she shall 
<A NAME="902"></A>only be allowed to bear witness. A slave of either sex and a child shall 
<A NAME="903"></A>be allowed to give evidence and to plead, but only in cases of murder; 
<A NAME="904"></A>and they must produce sufficient sureties that they will certainly remain 
<A NAME="905"></A>until the trial, in case they should be charged with false witness. And 
<A NAME="906"></A>either of the parties in a cause may bring an accusation of perjury against 
<A NAME="907"></A>witnesses, touching their evidence in whole or in part, if he asserts that 
<A NAME="908"></A>such evidence has been given; but the accusation must be brought previous 
<A NAME="909"></A>to the final decision of the cause. The magistrates shall preserve the 
<A NAME="910"></A>accusations of false witness, and have them kept under the seal of both 
<A NAME="911"></A>parties, and produce them on the day when the trial for false witness takes 
<A NAME="912"></A>place. If a man be twice convicted of false witness, he shall not be required, 
<A NAME="913"></A>and if thrice, he shall not be allowed to bear witness; and if he dare 
<A NAME="914"></A>to witness after he has been convicted three times, let any one who pleases 
<A NAME="915"></A>inform against him to the magistrates, and let the magistrates hand him 
<A NAME="916"></A>over to the court, and if he be convicted he shall be punished with death. 
<A NAME="917"></A>And in any case in which the evidence is rightly found to be false, and 
<A NAME="918"></A>yet to have given the victory to him who wins the suit, and more than half 
<A NAME="919"></A>the witnesses are condemned, the decision which was gained by these means 
<A NAME="920"></A>shall be a discussion and a decision as to whether the suit was determined 
<A NAME="921"></A>by that false evidence or and in whichever way the decision may be given, 
<A NAME="922"></A>the previous suit shall be determined accordingly.
<A NAME="923"></A><BR><BR>There are many noble things in human life, but to most of them 
<A NAME="924"></A>attach evils which are fated to corrupt and spoil them. Is not justice 
<A NAME="925"></A>noble, which has been the civilizer of humanity? How then can the advocate 
<A NAME="926"></A>of justice be other than noble? And yet upon this profession which is presented 
<A NAME="927"></A>to us under the fair name of art has come an evil reputation. In the first 
<A NAME="928"></A>place; we are told that by ingenious pleas and the help of an advocate 
<A NAME="929"></A>the law enables a man to win a particular cause, whether just or unjust; 
<A NAME="930"></A>and the power of speech which is thereby imparted, are at the service of 
<A NAME="931"></A>him sho is willing to pay for them. Now in our state this so-called art, 
<A NAME="932"></A>whether really an art or only an experience and practice destitute of any 
<A NAME="933"></A>art, ought if possible never to come into existence, or if existing among 
<A NAME="934"></A>us should litten to the request of the legislator and go away into another 
<A NAME="935"></A>land, and not speak contrary to justice. If the offenders obey we say no 
<A NAME="936"></A>more; but those who disobey, the voice of the law is as follows:-If anyone 
<A NAME="937"></A>thinks that he will pervert the power of justice in the minds of the judges, 
<A NAME="938"></A>and unseasonably litigate or advocate, let any one who likes indict him 
<A NAME="939"></A>for malpractices of law and dishonest advocacy, and let him be judged in 
<A NAME="940"></A>the court of select judges; and if he be convicted, let the court determine 
<A NAME="941"></A>whether he may be supposed to act from a love of money or from contentiousness. 
<A NAME="942"></A>And if he is supposed to act from contentiousness, the court shall fix 
<A NAME="943"></A>a time during which he shall not be allowed to institute or plead a cause; 
<A NAME="944"></A>and if he is supposed to act as be does from love of money, in case he 
<A NAME="945"></A>be a stranger, he shall leave the country, and never return under penalty 
<A NAME="946"></A>of death; but if he be a citizen, he shall die, because he is a lover of 
<A NAME="947"></A>money, in whatever manner gained; and equally, if he be judged to have 
<A NAME="948"></A>acted more than once from contentiousness, he shall 
<A NAME="949"></A>die.
