<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>The Republic of Plato is the longest of his works with the exception of 
<A NAME="11"></A>the Laws, and is certainly the greatest of them. There are nearer approaches 
<A NAME="12"></A>to modern metaphysics in the Philebus and in the Sophist; the Politicus 
<A NAME="13"></A>or Statesman is more ideal; the form and institutions of the State are 
<A NAME="14"></A>more clearly drawn out in the Laws; as works of art, the Symposium and 
<A NAME="15"></A>the Protagoras are of higher excellence. But no other Dialogue of Plato 
<A NAME="16"></A>has the same largeness of view and the same perfection of style; no other 
<A NAME="17"></A>shows an equal knowledge of the world, or contains more of those thoughts 
<A NAME="18"></A>which are new as well as old, and not of one age only but of all. Nowhere 
<A NAME="19"></A>in Plato is there a deeper irony or a greater wealth of humor or imagery, 
<A NAME="20"></A>or more dramatic power. Nor in any other of his writings is the attempt 
<A NAME="21"></A>made to interweave life and speculation, or to connect politics with philosophy. 
<A NAME="22"></A>The Republic is the centre around which the other Dialogues may be grouped; 
<A NAME="23"></A>here philosophy reaches the highest point to which ancient thinkers ever 
<A NAME="24"></A>attained. Plato among the Greeks, like Bacon among the moderns, was the 
<A NAME="25"></A>first who conceived a method of knowledge, although neither of them always 
<A NAME="26"></A>distinguished the bare outline or form from the substance of truth; and 
<A NAME="27"></A>both of them had to be content with an abstraction of science which was 
<A NAME="28"></A>not yet realized. He was the greatest metaphysical genius whom the world 
<A NAME="29"></A>has seen; and in him, more than in any other ancient thinker, the germs 
<A NAME="30"></A>of future knowledge are contained. The sciences of logic and psychology, 
<A NAME="31"></A>which have supplied so many instruments of thought to after-ages, are based 
<A NAME="32"></A>upon the analyses of Socrates and Plato. The principles of definition, 
<A NAME="33"></A>the law of contradiction, the fallacy of arguing in a circle, the distinction 
<A NAME="34"></A>between the essence and accidents of a thing or notion, between means and 
<A NAME="35"></A>ends, between causes and conditions; also the division of the mind into 
<A NAME="36"></A>the rational, concupiscent, and irascible elements, or of pleasures and 
<A NAME="37"></A>desires into necessary and unnecessary --these and other great forms of 
<A NAME="38"></A>thought are all of them to be found in the Republic, and were probably 
<A NAME="39"></A>first invented by Plato. The greatest of all logical truths, and the one 
<A NAME="40"></A>of which writers on philosophy are most apt to lose sight, the difference 
<A NAME="41"></A>between words and things, has been most strenuously insisted on by him, 
<A NAME="42"></A>although he has not always avoided the confusion of them in his own writings. 
<A NAME="43"></A>But he does not bind up truth in logical formulae, --logic is still veiled 
<A NAME="44"></A>in metaphysics; and the science which he imagines to "contemplate all truth 
<A NAME="45"></A>and all existence" is very unlike the doctrine of the syllogism which Aristotle 
<A NAME="46"></A>claims to have discovered.
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR>Neither must we forget that the Republic is but the third part 
<A NAME="48"></A>of a still larger design which was to have included an ideal history of 
<A NAME="49"></A>Athens, as well as a political and physical philosophy. The fragment of 
<A NAME="50"></A>the Critias has given birth to a world-famous fiction, second only in importance 
<A NAME="51"></A>to the tale of Troy and the legend of Arthur; and is said as a fact to 
<A NAME="52"></A>have inspired some of the early navigators of the sixteenth century. This 
<A NAME="53"></A>mythical tale, of which the subject was a history of the wars of the Athenians 
<A NAME="54"></A>against the Island of Atlantis, is supposed to be founded upon an unfinished 
<A NAME="55"></A>poem of Solon, to which it would have stood in the same relation as the 
<A NAME="56"></A>writings of the logographers to the poems of Homer. It would have told 
<A NAME="57"></A>of a struggle for Liberty, intended to represent the conflict of Persia 
<A NAME="58"></A>and Hellas. We may judge from the noble commencement of the Timaeus, from 
<A NAME="59"></A>the fragment of the Critias itself, and from the third book of the Laws, 
<A NAME="60"></A>in what manner Plato would have treated this high argument. We can only 
<A NAME="61"></A>guess why the great design was abandoned; perhaps because Plato became 
<A NAME="62"></A>sensible of some incongruity in a fictitious history, or because he had 
<A NAME="63"></A>lost his interest in it, or because advancing years forbade the completion 
<A NAME="64"></A>of it; and we may please ourselves with the fancy that had this imaginary 
<A NAME="65"></A>narrative ever been finished, we should have found Plato himself sympathizing 
<A NAME="66"></A>with the struggle for Hellenic independence, singing a hymn of triumph 
<A NAME="67"></A>over Marathon and Salamis, perhaps making the reflection of Herodotus where 
<A NAME="68"></A>he contemplates the growth of the Athenian empire--"How brave a thing is 
<A NAME="69"></A>freedom of speech, which has made the Athenians so far exceed every other 
<A NAME="70"></A>state of Hellas in greatness!" or, more probably, attributing the victory 
<A NAME="71"></A>to the ancient good order of Athens and to the favor of Apollo and 
<A NAME="72"></A>Athene.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>Again, Plato may be regarded as the "captain" ('arhchegoz') or 
<A NAME="74"></A>leader of a goodly band of followers; for in the Republic is to be found 
<A NAME="75"></A>the original of Cicero's De Republica, of St. Augustine's City of God, 
<A NAME="76"></A>of the Utopia of Sir Thomas More, and of the numerous other imaginary States 
<A NAME="77"></A>which are framed upon the same model. The extent to which Aristotle or 
<A NAME="78"></A>the Aristotelian school were indebted to him in the Politics has been little 
<A NAME="79"></A>recognized, and the recognition is the more necessary because it is not 
<A NAME="80"></A>made by Aristotle himself. The two philosophers had more in common than 
<A NAME="81"></A>they were conscious of; and probably some elements of Plato remain still 
<A NAME="82"></A>undetected in Aristotle. In English philosophy too, many affinities may 
<A NAME="83"></A>be traced, not only in the works of the Cambridge Platonists, but in great 
<A NAME="84"></A>original writers like Berkeley or Coleridge, to Plato and his ideas. That 
<A NAME="85"></A>there is a truth higher than experience, of which the mind bears witness 
<A NAME="86"></A>to herself, is a conviction which in our own generation has been enthusiastically 
<A NAME="87"></A>asserted, and is perhaps gaining ground. Of the Greek authors who at the 
<A NAME="88"></A>Renaissance brought a new life into the world Plato has had the greatest 
<A NAME="89"></A>influence. The Republic of Plato is also the first treatise upon education, 
<A NAME="90"></A>of which the writings of Milton and Locke, Rousseau, Jean Paul, and Goethe 
<A NAME="91"></A>are the legitimate descendants. Like Dante or Bunyan, he has a revelation 
<A NAME="92"></A>of another life; like Bacon, he is profoundly impressed with the un unity 
<A NAME="93"></A>of knowledge; in the early Church he exercised a real influence on theology, 
<A NAME="94"></A>and at the Revival of Literature on politics. Even the fragments of his 
<A NAME="95"></A>words when "repeated at second-hand" have in all ages ravished the hearts 
<A NAME="96"></A>of men, who have seen reflected in them their own higher nature. He is 
<A NAME="97"></A>the father of idealism in philosophy, in politics, in literature. And many 
<A NAME="98"></A>of the latest conceptions of modern thinkers and statesmen, such as the 
<A NAME="99"></A>unity of knowledge, the reign of law, and the equality of the sexes, have 
<A NAME="100"></A>been anticipated in a dream by him.
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR>Argument
<A NAME="102"></A><BR><BR>The argument of the Republic is the search after Justice, the nature 
<A NAME="103"></A>of which is first hinted at by Cephalus, the just and blameless old man 
<A NAME="104"></A>--then discussed on the basis of proverbial morality by Socrates and Polemarchus 
<A NAME="105"></A>--then caricatured by Thrasymachus and partially explained by Socrates 
<A NAME="106"></A>--reduced to an abstraction by Glaucon and Adeimantus, and having become 
<A NAME="107"></A>invisible in the individual reappears at length in the ideal State which 
<A NAME="108"></A>is constructed by Socrates. The first care of the rulers is to be education, 
<A NAME="109"></A>of which an outline is drawn after the old Hellenic model, providing only 
<A NAME="110"></A>for an improved religion and morality, and more simplicity in music and 
<A NAME="111"></A>gymnastic, a manlier strain of poetry, and greater harmony of the individual 
<A NAME="112"></A>and the State. We are thus led on to the conception of a higher State, 
<A NAME="113"></A>in which "no man calls anything his own," and in which there is neither 
<A NAME="114"></A>"marrying nor giving in marriage," and "kings are philosophers" and "philosophers 
<A NAME="115"></A>are kings;" and there is another and higher education, intellectual as 
<A NAME="116"></A>well as moral and religious, of science as well as of art, and not of youth 
<A NAME="117"></A>only but of the whole of life. Such a State is hardly to be realized in 
<A NAME="118"></A>this world and would quickly degenerate. To the perfect ideal succeeds 
<A NAME="119"></A>the government of the soldier and the lover of honor, this again declining 
<A NAME="120"></A>into democracy, and democracy into tyranny, in an imaginary but regular 
<A NAME="121"></A>order having not much resemblance to the actual facts. When "the wheel 
<A NAME="122"></A>has come full circle" we do not begin again with a new period of human 
<A NAME="123"></A>life; but we have passed from the best to the worst, and there we end. 
<A NAME="124"></A>The subject is then changed and the old quarrel of poetry and philosophy 
<A NAME="125"></A>which had been more lightly treated in the earlier books of the Republic 
<A NAME="126"></A>is now resumed and fought out to a conclusion. Poetry is discovered to 
<A NAME="127"></A>be an imitation thrice removed from the truth, and Homer, as well as the 
<A NAME="128"></A>dramatic poets, having been condemned as an imitator, is sent into banishment 
<A NAME="129"></A>along with them. And the idea of the State is supplemented by the revelation 
<A NAME="130"></A>of a future life.
<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR>The division into books, like all similar divisions, is probably 
<A NAME="132"></A>later than the age of Plato. The natural divisions are five in number; 
<A NAME="133"></A>--(1) Book I and the first half of Book II down to the paragraph beginning, 
<A NAME="134"></A>"I had always admired the genius of Glaucon and Adeimantus," which is introductory; 
<A NAME="135"></A>the first book containing a refutation of the popular and sophistical notions 
<A NAME="136"></A>of justice, and concluding, like some of the earlier Dialogues, without 
<A NAME="137"></A>arriving at any definite result. To this is appended a restatement of the 
<A NAME="138"></A>nature of justice according to common opinion, and an answer is demanded 
<A NAME="139"></A>to the question --What is justice, stripped of appearances? The second 
<A NAME="140"></A>division (2) includes the remainder of the second and the whole of the 
<A NAME="141"></A>third and fourth books, which are mainly occupied with the construction 
<A NAME="142"></A>of the first State and the first education. The third division (3) consists 
<A NAME="143"></A>of the fifth, sixth, and seventh books, in which philosophy rather than 
<A NAME="144"></A>justice is the subject of inquiry, and the second State is constructed 
<A NAME="145"></A>on principles of communism and ruled by philosophers, and the contemplation 
<A NAME="146"></A>of the idea of good takes the place of the social and political virtues. 
<A NAME="147"></A>In the eighth and ninth books (4) the perversions of States and of the 
<A NAME="148"></A>individuals who correspond to them are reviewed in succession; and the 
<A NAME="149"></A>nature of pleasure and the principle of tyranny are further analyzed in 
<A NAME="150"></A>the individual man. The tenth book (5) is the conclusion of the whole, 
<A NAME="151"></A>in which the relations of philosophy to poetry are finally determined, 
<A NAME="152"></A>and the happiness of the citizens in this life, which has now been assured, 
<A NAME="153"></A>is crowned by the vision of another.
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR>Or a more general division into two parts may be adopted; the first 
<A NAME="155"></A>(Books I - IV) containing the description of a State framed generally in 
<A NAME="156"></A>accordance with Hellenic notions of religion and morality, while in the 
<A NAME="157"></A>second (Books V - X) the Hellenic State is transformed into an ideal kingdom 
<A NAME="158"></A>of philosophy, of which all other governments are the perversions. These 
<A NAME="159"></A>two points of view are really opposed, and the opposition is only veiled 
<A NAME="160"></A>by the genius of Plato. The Republic, like the Phaedrus, is an imperfect 
<A NAME="161"></A>whole; the higher light of philosophy breaks through the regularity of 
<A NAME="162"></A>the Hellenic temple, which at last fades away into the heavens. Whether 
<A NAME="163"></A>this imperfection of structure arises from an enlargement of the plan; 
<A NAME="164"></A>or from the imperfect reconcilement in the writer's own mind of the struggling 
<A NAME="165"></A>elements of thought which are now first brought together by him; or, perhaps, 
<A NAME="166"></A>from the composition of the work at different times --are questions, like 
<A NAME="167"></A>the similar question about the Iliad and the Odyssey, which are worth asking, 
<A NAME="168"></A>but which cannot have a distinct answer. In the age of Plato there was 
<A NAME="169"></A>no regular mode of publication, and an author would have the less scruple 
<A NAME="170"></A>in altering or adding to a work which was known only to a few of his friends. 
<A NAME="171"></A>There is no absurdity in supposing that he may have laid his labors aside 
<A NAME="172"></A>for a time, or turned from one work to another; and such interruptions 
<A NAME="173"></A>would be more likely to occur in the case of a long than of a short writing. 
<A NAME="174"></A>In all attempts to determine the chronological he order of the Platonic 
<A NAME="175"></A>writings on internal evidence, this uncertainty about any single Dialogue 
<A NAME="176"></A>being composed at one time is a disturbing element, which must be admitted 
<A NAME="177"></A>to affect longer works, such as the Republic and the Laws, more than shorter 
<A NAME="178"></A>ones. But, on the other hand, the seeming discrepancies of the Republic 
<A NAME="179"></A>may only arise out of the discordant elements which the philosopher has 
<A NAME="180"></A>attempted to unite in a single whole, perhaps without being himself able 
<A NAME="181"></A>to recognize the inconsistency which is obvious to us. For there is a judgment 
<A NAME="182"></A>of after ages which few great writers have ever been able to anticipate 
<A NAME="183"></A>for themselves. They do not perceive the want of connection in their own 
<A NAME="184"></A>writings, or the gaps in their systems which are visible enough to those 
<A NAME="185"></A>who come after them. In the beginnings of literature and philosophy, amid 
<A NAME="186"></A>the first efforts of thought and language, more inconsistencies occur than 
<A NAME="187"></A>now, when the paths of speculation are well worn and the meaning of words 
<A NAME="188"></A>precisely defined. For consistency, too, is the growth of time; and some 
<A NAME="189"></A>of the greatest creations of the human mind have been wanting in unity. 
<A NAME="190"></A>Tried by this test, several of the Platonic Dialogues, according to our 
<A NAME="191"></A>modern ideas, appear to be defective, but the deficiency is no proof that 
<A NAME="192"></A>they were composed at different times or by different hands. And the supposition 
<A NAME="193"></A>that the Republic was written uninterruptedly and by a continuous effort 
<A NAME="194"></A>is in some degree confirmed by the numerous references from one part of 
<A NAME="195"></A>the work to another.
<A NAME="196"></A><BR><BR>The second title, "Concerning Justice," is not the one by which 
<A NAME="197"></A>the Republic is quoted, either by Aristotle or generally in antiquity, 
<A NAME="198"></A>and, like the other second titles of the Platonic Dialogues, may therefore 
<A NAME="199"></A>be assumed to be of later date. Morgenstern and others have asked whether 
<A NAME="200"></A>the definition of justice, which is the professed aim, or the construction 
<A NAME="201"></A>of the State is the principal argument of the work. The answer is, that 
<A NAME="202"></A>the two blend in one, and are two faces of the same truth; for justice 
<A NAME="203"></A>is the order of the State, and the State is the visible embodiment of justice 
<A NAME="204"></A>under the conditions of human society. The one is the soul and the other 
<A NAME="205"></A>is the body, and the Greek ideal of the State, as of the individual, is 
<A NAME="206"></A>a fair mind in a fair body. In Hegelian phraseology the State is the reality 
<A NAME="207"></A>of which justice is the ideal. Or, described in Christian language, the 
<A NAME="208"></A>kingdom of God is within, and yet develops into a Church or external kingdom; 
<A NAME="209"></A>"the house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens," is reduced to 
<A NAME="210"></A>the proportions of an earthly building. Or, to use a Platonic image, justice 
<A NAME="211"></A>and the State are the warp and the woof which run through the whole texture. 
<A NAME="212"></A>And when the constitution of the State is completed, the conception of 
<A NAME="213"></A>justice is not dismissed, but reappears under the same or different names 
<A NAME="214"></A>throughout the work, both as the inner law of the individual soul, and 
<A NAME="215"></A>finally as the principle of rewards and punishments in another life. The 
<A NAME="216"></A>virtues are based on justice, of which common honesty in buying and selling 
<A NAME="217"></A>is the shadow, and justice is based on the idea of good, which is the harmony 
<A NAME="218"></A>of the world, and is reflected both in the institutions of States and in 
<A NAME="219"></A>motions of the heavenly bodies. The Timaeus, which takes up the political 
<A NAME="220"></A>rather than the ethical side of the Republic, and is chiefly occupied with 
<A NAME="221"></A>hypotheses concerning the outward world, yet contains many indications 
<A NAME="222"></A>that the same law is supposed to reign over the State, over nature, and 
<A NAME="223"></A>over man.
<A NAME="224"></A><BR><BR>Too much, however, has been made of this question both in ancient 
<A NAME="225"></A>and in modern times. There is a stage of criticism in which all works, 
<A NAME="226"></A>whether of nature or of art, are referred to design. Now in ancient writings, 
<A NAME="227"></A>and indeed in literature generally, there remains often a large element 
<A NAME="228"></A>which was not comprehended in the original design. For the plan grows under 
<A NAME="229"></A>the author's hand; new thoughts occur to him in the act of writing; he 
<A NAME="230"></A>has not worked out the argument to the end before he begins. The reader 
<A NAME="231"></A>who seeks to find some one idea under which the whole may be conceived, 
<A NAME="232"></A>must necessarily seize on the vaguest and most general. Thus Stallbaum, 
<A NAME="233"></A>who is dissatisfied with the ordinary explanations of the argument of the 
<A NAME="234"></A>Republic, imagines himself to have found the true argument "in the representation 
<A NAME="235"></A>of human life in a State perfected by justice and governed according to 
<A NAME="236"></A>the idea of good." There may be some use in such general descriptions, 
<A NAME="237"></A>but they can hardly be said to express the design of the writer. The truth 
<A NAME="238"></A>is, that we may as well speak of many designs as of one; nor need anything 
<A NAME="239"></A>be excluded from the plan of a great work to which the mind is naturally 
<A NAME="240"></A>led by the association of ideas, and which does not interfere with the 
<A NAME="241"></A>general purpose. What kind or degree of unity is to be sought after in 
<A NAME="242"></A>a building, in the plastic arts, in poetry, in prose, is a problem which 
<A NAME="243"></A>has to be determined relatively to the subject-matter. To Plato himself, 
<A NAME="244"></A>the inquiry "what was the intention of the writer," or "what was the principal 
<A NAME="245"></A>argument of the Republic" would have been hardly intelligible, and therefore 
<A NAME="246"></A>had better be at once dismissed.
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR>Is not the Republic the vehicle of three or four great truths which, 
<A NAME="248"></A>to Plato's own mind, are most naturally represented in the form of the 
<A NAME="249"></A>State? Just as in the Jewish prophets the reign of Messiah, or "the day 
<A NAME="250"></A>of the Lord," or the suffering Servant or people of God, or the "Sun of 
<A NAME="251"></A>righteousness with healing in his wings" only convey, to us at least, their 
<A NAME="252"></A>great spiritual ideals, so through the Greek State Plato reveals to us 
<A NAME="253"></A>his own thoughts about divine perfection, which is the idea of good --like 
<A NAME="254"></A>the sun in the visible world; --about human perfection, which is justice 
<A NAME="255"></A>--about education beginning in youth and continuing in later years --about 
<A NAME="256"></A>poets and sophists and tyrants who are the false teachers and evil rulers 
<A NAME="257"></A>of mankind --about "the world" which is the embodiment of them --about 
<A NAME="258"></A>a kingdom which exists nowhere upon earth but is laid up in heaven to be 
<A NAME="259"></A>the pattern and rule of human life. No such inspired creation is at unity 
<A NAME="260"></A>with itself, any more than the clouds of heaven when the sun pierces through 
<A NAME="261"></A>them. Every shade of light and dark, of truth, and of fiction which is 
<A NAME="262"></A>the veil of truth, is allowable in a work of philosophical imagination. 
<A NAME="263"></A>It is not all on the same plane; it easily passes from ideas to myths and 
<A NAME="264"></A>fancies, from facts to figures of speech. It is not prose but poetry, at 
<A NAME="265"></A>least a great part of it, and ought not to be judged by the rules of logic 
<A NAME="266"></A>or the probabilities of history. The writer is not fashioning his ideas 
<A NAME="267"></A>into an artistic whole; they take possession of him and are too much for 
<A NAME="268"></A>him. We have no need therefore to discuss whether a State such as Plato 
<A NAME="269"></A>has conceived is practicable or not, or whether the outward form or the 
<A NAME="270"></A>inward life came first into the mind of the writer. For the practicability 
<A NAME="271"></A>of his ideas has nothing to do with their truth; and the highest thoughts 
<A NAME="272"></A>to which he attains may be truly said to bear the greatest "marks of design" 
<A NAME="273"></A>--justice more than the external frame-work of the State, the idea of good 
<A NAME="274"></A>more than justice. The great science of dialectic or the organization of 
<A NAME="275"></A>ideas has no real content; but is only a type of the method or spirit in 
<A NAME="276"></A>which the higher knowledge is to be pursued by the spectator of all time 
<A NAME="277"></A>and all existence. It is in the fifth, sixth, and seventh books that Plato 
<A NAME="278"></A>reaches the "summit of speculation," and these, although they fail to satisfy 
<A NAME="279"></A>the requirements of a modern thinker, may therefore be regarded as the 
<A NAME="280"></A>most important, as they are also the most original, portions of the 
<A NAME="281"></A>work.
<A NAME="282"></A><BR><BR>It is not necessary to discuss at length a minor question which 
<A NAME="283"></A>has been raised by Boeckh, respecting the imaginary date at which the conversation 
<A NAME="284"></A>was held (the year 411 B. C. which is proposed by him will do as well as 
<A NAME="285"></A>any other); for a writer of fiction, and especially a writer who, like 
<A NAME="286"></A>Plato, is notoriously careless of chronology, only aims at general probability. 
<A NAME="287"></A>Whether all the persons mentioned in the Republic could ever have met at 
<A NAME="288"></A>any one time is not a difficulty which would have occurred to an Athenian 
<A NAME="289"></A>reading the work forty years later, or to Plato himself at the time of 
<A NAME="290"></A>writing (any more than to Shakespeare respecting one of his own dramas); 
<A NAME="291"></A>and need not greatly trouble us now. Yet this may be a question having 
<A NAME="292"></A>no answer "which is still worth asking," because the investigation shows 
<A NAME="293"></A>that we can not argue historically from the dates in Plato; it would be 
<A NAME="294"></A>useless therefore to waste time in inventing far-fetched reconcilements 
<A NAME="295"></A>of them in order avoid chronological difficulties, such, for example, as 
<A NAME="296"></A>the conjecture of C. F. Hermann, that Glaucon and Adeimantus are not the 
<A NAME="297"></A>brothers but the uncles of Plato, or the fancy of Stallbaum that Plato 
<A NAME="298"></A>intentionally left anachronisms indicating the dates at which some of his 
<A NAME="299"></A>Dialogues were written.
<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR>Characters
<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR>The principal characters in the Republic are Cephalus, Polemarchus, 
<A NAME="302"></A>Thrasymachus, Socrates, Glaucon, and Adeimantus. Cephalus appears in the 
<A NAME="303"></A>introduction only, Polemarchus drops at the end of the first argument, 
<A NAME="304"></A>and Thrasymachus is reduced to silence at the close of the first book. 
<A NAME="305"></A>The main discussion is carried on by Socrates, Glaucon, and Adeimantus. 
<A NAME="306"></A>Among the company are Lysias (the orator) and Euthydemus, the sons of Cephalus 
<A NAME="307"></A>and brothers of Polemarchus, an unknown Charmantides --these are mute auditors; 
<A NAME="308"></A>also there is Cleitophon, who once interrupts, where, as in the Dialogue 
<A NAME="309"></A>which bears his name, he appears as the friend and ally of 
<A NAME="310"></A>Thrasymachus.
<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR>Cephalus, the patriarch of house, has been appropriately engaged 
<A NAME="312"></A>in offering a sacrifice. He is the pattern of an old man who has almost 
<A NAME="313"></A>done with life, and is at peace with himself and with all mankind. He feels 
<A NAME="314"></A>that he is drawing nearer to the world below, and seems to linger around 
<A NAME="315"></A>the memory of the past. He is eager that Socrates should come to visit 
<A NAME="316"></A>him, fond of the poetry of the last generation, happy in the consciousness 
<A NAME="317"></A>of a well-spent life, glad at having escaped from the tyranny of youthful 
<A NAME="318"></A>lusts. His love of conversation, his affection, his indifference to riches, 
<A NAME="319"></A>even his garrulity, are interesting traits of character. He is not one 
<A NAME="320"></A>of those who have nothing to say, because their whole mind has been absorbed 
<A NAME="321"></A>in making money. Yet he acknowledges that riches have the advantage of 
<A NAME="322"></A>placing men above the temptation to dishonesty or falsehood. The respectful 
<A NAME="323"></A>attention shown to him by Socrates, whose love of conversation, no less 
<A NAME="324"></A>than the mission imposed upon him by the Oracle, leads him to ask questions 
<A NAME="325"></A>of all men, young and old alike, should also be noted. Who better suited 
<A NAME="326"></A>to raise the question of justice than Cephalus, whose life might seem to 
<A NAME="327"></A>be the expression of it? The moderation with which old age is pictured 
<A NAME="328"></A>by Cephalus as a very tolerable portion of existence is characteristic, 
<A NAME="329"></A>not only of him, but of Greek feeling generally, and contrasts with the 
<A NAME="330"></A>exaggeration of Cicero in the De Senectute. The evening of life is described 
<A NAME="331"></A>by Plato in the most expressive manner, yet with the fewest possible touches. 
<A NAME="332"></A>As Cicero remarks (Ep. ad Attic. iv. 16), the aged Cephalus would have 
<A NAME="333"></A>been out of place in the discussion which follows, and which he could neither 
<A NAME="334"></A>have understood nor taken part in without a violation of dramatic 
<A NAME="335"></A>propriety.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR><BR>His "son and heir" Polemarchus has the frankness and impetuousness 
<A NAME="337"></A>of youth; he is for detaining Socrates by force in the opening scene, and 
<A NAME="338"></A>will not "let him off" on the subject of women and children. Like Cephalus, 
<A NAME="339"></A>he is limited in his point of view, and represents the proverbial stage 
<A NAME="340"></A>of morality which has rules of life rather than principles; and he quotes 
<A NAME="341"></A>Simonides as his father had quoted Pindar. But after this he has no more 
<A NAME="342"></A>to say; the answers which he makes are only elicited from him by the dialectic 
<A NAME="343"></A>of Socrates. He has not yet experienced the influence of the Sophists like 
<A NAME="344"></A>Glaucon and Adeimantus, nor is he sensible of the necessity of refuting 
<A NAME="345"></A>them; he belongs to the pre-Socratic or pre-dialectical age. He is incapable 
<A NAME="346"></A>of arguing, and is bewildered by Socrates to such a degree that he does 
<A NAME="347"></A>not know what he is saying. He is made to admit that justice is a thief, 
<A NAME="348"></A>and that the virtues follow the analogy of the arts. From his brother Lysias 
<A NAME="349"></A>we learn that he fell a victim to the Thirty Tyrants, but no allusion is 
<A NAME="350"></A>here made to his fate, nor to the circumstance that Cephalus and his family 
<A NAME="351"></A>were of Syracusan origin, and had migrated from Thurii to 
<A NAME="352"></A>Athens.
<A NAME="353"></A><BR><BR>The "Chalcedonian giant," Thrasymachus, of whom we have already 
<A NAME="354"></A>heard in the Phaedrus, is the personification of the Sophists, according 
<A NAME="355"></A>to Plato's conception of them, in some of their worst characteristics. 
<A NAME="356"></A>He is vain and blustering, refusing to discourse unless he is paid, fond 
<A NAME="357"></A>of making an oration, and hoping thereby to escape the inevitable Socrates; 
<A NAME="358"></A>but a mere child in argument, and unable to foresee that the next "move" 
<A NAME="359"></A>(to use a Platonic expression) will "shut him up." He has reached the stage 
<A NAME="360"></A>of framing general notions, and in this respect is in advance of Cephalus 
<A NAME="361"></A>and Polemarchus. But he is incapable of defending them in a discussion, 
<A NAME="362"></A>and vainly tries to cover his confusion in banter and insolence. Whether 
<A NAME="363"></A>such doctrines as are attributed to him by Plato were really held either 
<A NAME="364"></A>by him or by any other Sophist is uncertain; in the infancy of philosophy 
<A NAME="365"></A>serious errors about morality might easily grow up --they are certainly 
<A NAME="366"></A>put into the mouths of speakers in Thucydides; but we are concerned at 
<A NAME="367"></A>present with Plato's description of him, and not with the historical reality. 
<A NAME="368"></A>The inequality of the contest adds greatly to the humor of the scene. The 
<A NAME="369"></A>pompous and empty Sophist is utterly helpless in the hands of the great 
<A NAME="370"></A>master of dialectic, who knows how to touch all the springs of vanity and 
<A NAME="371"></A>weakness in him. He is greatly irritated by the irony of Socrates, but 
<A NAME="372"></A>his noisy and imbecile rage only lays him more and more open to the thrusts 
<A NAME="373"></A>of his assailant. His determination to cram down their throats, or put 
<A NAME="374"></A>"bodily into their souls" his own words, elicits a cry of horror from Socrates. 
<A NAME="375"></A>The state of his temper is quite as worthy of remark as the process of 
<A NAME="376"></A>the argument. Nothing is more amusing than his complete submission when 
<A NAME="377"></A>he has been once thoroughly beaten. At first he seems to continue the discussion 
<A NAME="378"></A>with reluctance, but soon with apparent good-will, and he even testifies 
<A NAME="379"></A>his interest at a later stage by one or two occasional remarks. When attacked 
<A NAME="380"></A>by Glaucon he is humorously protected by Socrates "as one who has never 
<A NAME="381"></A>been his enemy and is now his friend." From Cicero and Quintilian and from 
<A NAME="382"></A>Aristotle's Rhetoric we learn that the Sophist whom Plato has made so ridiculous 
<A NAME="383"></A>was a man of note whose writings were preserved in later ages. The play 
<A NAME="384"></A>on his name which was made by his contemporary Herodicus, "thou wast ever 
<A NAME="385"></A>bold in battle," seems to show that the description of him is not devoid 
<A NAME="386"></A>of verisimilitude.
<A NAME="387"></A><BR><BR>When Thrasymachus has been silenced, the two principal respondents, 
<A NAME="388"></A>Glaucon and Adeimantus, appear on the scene: here, as in Greek tragedy, 
<A NAME="389"></A>three actors are introduced. At first sight the two sons of Ariston may 
<A NAME="390"></A>seem to wear a family likeness, like the two friends Simmias and Cebes 
<A NAME="391"></A>in the Phaedo. But on a nearer examination of them the similarity vanishes, 
<A NAME="392"></A>and they are seen to be distinct characters. Glaucon is the impetuous youth 
<A NAME="393"></A>who can "just never have enough of fechting" (cf. the character of him 
<A NAME="394"></A>in Xen. Mem. iii. 6); the man of pleasure who is acquainted with the mysteries 
<A NAME="395"></A>of love; the "juvenis qui gaudet canibus," and who improves the breed of 
<A NAME="396"></A>animals; the lover of art and music who has all the experiences of youthful 
<A NAME="397"></A>life. He is full of quickness and penetration, piercing easily below the 
<A NAME="398"></A>clumsy platitudes of Thrasymachus to the real difficulty; he turns out 
<A NAME="399"></A>to the light the seamy side of human life, and yet does not lose faith 
<A NAME="400"></A>in the just and true. It is Glaucon who seizes what may be termed the ludicrous 
<A NAME="401"></A>relation of the philosopher to the world, to whom a state of simplicity 
<A NAME="402"></A>is "a city of pigs," who is always prepared with a jest when the argument 
<A NAME="403"></A>offers him an opportunity, and who is ever ready to second the humor of 
<A NAME="404"></A>Socrates and to appreciate the ridiculous, whether in the connoisseurs 
<A NAME="405"></A>of music, or in the lovers of theatricals, or in the fantastic behavior 
<A NAME="406"></A>of the citizens of democracy. His weaknesses are several times alluded 
<A NAME="407"></A>to by Socrates, who, however, will not allow him to be attacked by his 
<A NAME="408"></A>brother Adeimantus. He is a soldier, and, like Adeimantus, has been distinguished 
<A NAME="409"></A>at the battle of Megara.
<A NAME="410"></A><BR><BR>The character of Adeimantus is deeper and graver, and the profounder 
<A NAME="411"></A>objections are commonly put into his mouth. Glaucon is more demonstrative, 
<A NAME="412"></A>and generally opens the game. Adeimantus pursues the argument further. 
<A NAME="413"></A>Glaucon has more of the liveliness and quick sympathy of youth; Adeimantus 
<A NAME="414"></A>has the maturer judgment of a grown-up man of the world. In the second 
<A NAME="415"></A>book, when Glaucon insists that justice and injustice shall be considered 
<A NAME="416"></A>without regard to their consequences, Adeimantus remarks that they are 
<A NAME="417"></A>regarded by mankind in general only for the sake of their consequences; 
<A NAME="418"></A>and in a similar vein of reflection he urges at the beginning of the fourth 
<A NAME="419"></A>book that Socrates falls in making his citizens happy, and is answered 
<A NAME="420"></A>that happiness is not the first but the second thing, not the direct aim 
<A NAME="421"></A>but the indirect consequence of the good government of a State. In the 
<A NAME="422"></A>discussion about religion and mythology, Adeimantus is the respondent, 
<A NAME="423"></A>but Glaucon breaks in with a slight jest, and carries on the conversation 
<A NAME="424"></A>in a lighter tone about music and gymnastic to the end of the book. It 
<A NAME="425"></A>is Adeimantus again who volunteers the criticism of common sense on the 
<A NAME="426"></A>Socratic method of argument, and who refuses to let Socrates pass lightly 
<A NAME="427"></A>over the question of women and children. It is Adeimantus who is the respondent 
<A NAME="428"></A>in the more argumentative, as Glaucon in the lighter and more imaginative 
<A NAME="429"></A>portions of the Dialogue. For example, throughout the greater part of the 
<A NAME="430"></A>sixth book, the causes of the corruption of philosophy and the conception 
<A NAME="431"></A>of the idea of good are discussed with Adeimantus. Then Glaucon resumes 
<A NAME="432"></A>his place of principal respondent; but he has a difficulty in apprehending 
<A NAME="433"></A>the higher education of Socrates, and makes some false hits in the course 
<A NAME="434"></A>of the discussion. Once more Adeimantus returns with the allusion to his 
<A NAME="435"></A>brother Glaucon whom he compares to the contentious State; in the next 
<A NAME="436"></A>book he is again superseded, and Glaucon continues to the 
<A NAME="437"></A>end.
<A NAME="438"></A><BR><BR>Thus in a succession of characters Plato represents the successive 
<A NAME="439"></A>stages of morality, beginning with the Athenian gentleman of the olden 
<A NAME="440"></A>time, who is followed by the practical man of that day regulating his life 
<A NAME="441"></A>by proverbs and saws; to him succeeds the wild generalization of the Sophists, 
<A NAME="442"></A>and lastly come the young disciples of the great teacher, who know the 
<A NAME="443"></A>sophistical arguments but will not be convinced by them, and desire to 
<A NAME="444"></A>go deeper into the nature of things. These too, like Cephalus, Polemarchus, 
<A NAME="445"></A>Thrasymachus, are clearly distinguished from one another. Neither in the 
<A NAME="446"></A>Republic, nor in any other Dialogue of Plato, is a single character 
<A NAME="447"></A>repeated.
<A NAME="448"></A><BR><BR>The delineation of Socrates in the Republic is not wholly consistent. 
<A NAME="449"></A>In the first book we have more of the real Socrates, such as he is depicted 
<A NAME="450"></A>in the Memorabilia of Xenophon, in the earliest Dialogues of Plato, and 
<A NAME="451"></A>in the Apology. He is ironical, provoking, questioning, the old enemy of 
<A NAME="452"></A>the Sophists, ready to put on the mask of Silenus as well as to argue seriously. 
<A NAME="453"></A>But in the sixth book his enmity towards the Sophists abates; he acknowledges 
<A NAME="454"></A>that they are the representatives rather than the corrupters of the world. 
<A NAME="455"></A>He also becomes more dogmatic and constructive, passing beyond the range 
<A NAME="456"></A>either of the political or the speculative ideas of the real Socrates. 
<A NAME="457"></A>In one passage Plato himself seems to intimate that the time had now come 
<A NAME="458"></A>for Socrates, who had passed his whole life in philosophy, to give his 
<A NAME="459"></A>own opinion and not to be always repeating the notions of other men. There 
<A NAME="460"></A>is no evidence that either the idea of good or the conception of a perfect 
<A NAME="461"></A>State were comprehended in the Socratic teaching, though he certainly dwelt 
<A NAME="462"></A>on the nature of the universal and of final causes (cp. Xen. Mem. i. 4; 
<A NAME="463"></A>Phaedo 97); and a deep thinker like him in his thirty or forty years of 
<A NAME="464"></A>public teaching, could hardly have falled to touch on the nature of family 
<A NAME="465"></A>relations, for which there is also some positive evidence in the Memorabilia 
<A NAME="466"></A>(Mem. i. 2, 51 foll.) The Socratic method is nominally retained; and every 
<A NAME="467"></A>inference is either put into the mouth of the respondent or represented 
<A NAME="468"></A>as the common discovery of him and Socrates. But any one can see that this 
<A NAME="469"></A>is a mere form, of which the affectation grows wearisome as the work advances. 
<A NAME="470"></A>The method of inquiry has passed into a method of teaching in which by 
<A NAME="471"></A>the help of interlocutors the same thesis is looked at from various points 
<A NAME="472"></A>of view.
<A NAME="473"></A><BR><BR>The nature of the process is truly characterized by Glaucon, when 
<A NAME="474"></A>he describes himself as a companion who is not good for much in an investigation, 
<A NAME="475"></A>but can see what he is shown, and may, perhaps, give the answer to a question 
<A NAME="476"></A>more fluently than another.
<A NAME="477"></A><BR><BR>Neither can we be absolutely certain that, Socrates himself taught 
<A NAME="478"></A>the immortality of the soul, which is unknown to his disciple Glaucon in 
<A NAME="479"></A>the Republic; nor is there any reason to suppose that he used myths or 
<A NAME="480"></A>revelations of another world as a vehicle of instruction, or that he would 
<A NAME="481"></A>have banished poetry or have denounced the Greek mythology. His favorite 
<A NAME="482"></A>oath is retained, and a slight mention is made of the daemonium, or internal 
<A NAME="483"></A>sign, which is alluded to by Socrates as a phenomenon peculiar to himself. 
<A NAME="484"></A>A real element of Socratic teaching, which is more prominent in the Republic 
<A NAME="485"></A>than in any of the other Dialogues of Plato, is the use of example and 
<A NAME="486"></A>illustration ('taphorhtika auto prhospherhontez'): "Let us apply the test 
<A NAME="487"></A>of common instances." "You," says Adeimantus, ironically, in the sixth 
<A NAME="488"></A>book, "are so unaccustomed to speak in images." And this use of examples 
<A NAME="489"></A>or images, though truly Socratic in origin, is enlarged by the genius of 
<A NAME="490"></A>Plato into the form of an allegory or parable, which embodies in the concrete 
<A NAME="491"></A>what has been already described, or is about to be described, in the abstract. 
<A NAME="492"></A>Thus the figure of the cave in Book VII is a recapitulation of the divisions 
<A NAME="493"></A>of knowledge in Book VI. The composite animal in Book IX is an allegory 
<A NAME="494"></A>of the parts of the soul. The noble captain and the ship and the true pilot 
<A NAME="495"></A>in Book VI are a figure of the relation of the people to the philosophers 
<A NAME="496"></A>in the State which has been described. Other figures, such as the dog in 
<A NAME="497"></A>the second, third, and fourth books, or the marriage of the portionless 
<A NAME="498"></A>maiden in the sixth book, or the drones and wasps in the eighth and ninth 
<A NAME="499"></A>books, also form links of connection in long passages, or are used to recall 
<A NAME="500"></A>previous discussions.
<A NAME="501"></A><BR><BR>Plato is most true to the character of his master when he describes 
<A NAME="502"></A>him as "not of this world." And with this representation of him the ideal 
<A NAME="503"></A>State and the other paradoxes of the Republic are quite in accordance, 
<A NAME="504"></A>though they can not be shown to have been speculations of Socrates. To 
<A NAME="505"></A>him, as to other great teachers both philosophical and religious, when 
<A NAME="506"></A>they looked upward, the world seemed to be the embodiment of error and 
<A NAME="507"></A>evil. The common sense of mankind has revolted against this view, or has 
<A NAME="508"></A>only partially admitted it. And even in Socrates himself the sterner judgment 
<A NAME="509"></A>of the multitude at times passes into a sort of ironical pity or love. 
<A NAME="510"></A>Men in general are incapable of philosophy, and are therefore at enmity 
<A NAME="511"></A>with the philosopher; but their misunderstanding of him is unavoidable: 
<A NAME="512"></A>for they have never seen him as he truly is in his own image; they are 
<A NAME="513"></A>only acquainted with artificial systems possessing no native force of truth 
<A NAME="514"></A>--words which admit of many applications. Their leaders have nothing to 
<A NAME="515"></A>measure with, and are therefore ignorant of their own stature. But they 
<A NAME="516"></A>are to be pitied or laughed at, not to be quarrelled with; they mean well 
<A NAME="517"></A>with their nostrums, if they could only learn that they are cutting off 
<A NAME="518"></A>a Hydra's head. This moderation towards those who are in error is one of 
<A NAME="519"></A>the most characteristic features of Socrates in the Republic. In all the 
<A NAME="520"></A>different representations of Socrates, whether of Xenophon or Plato, and 
<A NAME="521"></A>the differences of the earlier or later Dialogues, he always retains the 
<A NAME="522"></A>character of the unwearied and disinterested seeker after truth, without 
<A NAME="523"></A>which he would have ceased to be Socrates.
<A NAME="524"></A><BR><BR>Leaving the characters we may now analyze the contents of the Republic, 
<A NAME="525"></A>and then proceed to consider (1) The general aspects of this Hellenic ideal 
<A NAME="526"></A>of the State, (2) The modern lights in which the thoughts of Plato may 
<A NAME="527"></A>be read.
