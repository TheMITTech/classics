<A NAME="10"></A>Adeimantus - SOCRATES
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>Here Adeimantus interposed a question: How would you answer, Socrates, 
<A NAME="12"></A>said he, if a person were to say that you are making these people miserable, 
<A NAME="13"></A>and that they are the cause of their own unhappiness; the city in fact 
<A NAME="14"></A>belongs to them, but they are none the better for it; whereas other men 
<A NAME="15"></A>acquire lands, and build large and handsome houses, and have everything 
<A NAME="16"></A>handsome about them, offering sacrifices to the gods on their own account, 
<A NAME="17"></A>and practising hospitality; moreover, as you were saying just now, they 
<A NAME="18"></A>have gold and silver, and all that is usual among the favourites of fortune; 
<A NAME="19"></A>but our poor citizens are no better than mercenaries who are quartered 
<A NAME="20"></A>in the city and are always mounting guard?
<A NAME="21"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I said; and you may add that they are only fed, and not paid 
<A NAME="22"></A>in addition to their food, like other men; and therefore they cannot, if 
<A NAME="23"></A>they would, take a journey of pleasure; they have no money to spend on 
<A NAME="24"></A>a mistress or any other luxurious fancy, which, as the world goes, is thought 
<A NAME="25"></A>to be happiness; and many other accusations of the same nature might be 
<A NAME="26"></A>added.
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR>But, said he, let us suppose all this to be included in the 
<A NAME="28"></A>charge.
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>You mean to ask, I said, what will be our answer?
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>If we proceed along the old path, my belief, I said, is that we shall 
<A NAME="32"></A>find the answer. And our answer will be that, even as they are, our guardians 
<A NAME="33"></A>may very likely be the happiest of men; but that our aim in founding the 
<A NAME="34"></A>State was not the disproportionate happiness of any one class, but the 
<A NAME="35"></A>greatest happiness of the whole; we thought that in a State which is ordered 
<A NAME="36"></A>with a view to the good of the whole we should be most likely to find Justice, 
<A NAME="37"></A>and in the ill-ordered State injustice: and, having found them, we might 
<A NAME="38"></A>then decide which of the two is the happier. At present, I take it, we 
<A NAME="39"></A>are fashioning the happy State, not piecemeal, or with a view of making 
<A NAME="40"></A>a few happy citizens, but as a whole; and by-and-by we will proceed to 
<A NAME="41"></A>view the opposite kind of State. Suppose that we were painting a statue, 
<A NAME="42"></A>and some one came up to us and said, Why do you not put the most beautiful 
<A NAME="43"></A>colours on the most beautiful parts of the body --the eyes ought to be 
<A NAME="44"></A>purple, but you have made them black --to him we might fairly answer, Sir, 
<A NAME="45"></A>you would not surely have us beautify the eyes to such a degree that they 
<A NAME="46"></A>are no longer eyes; consider rather whether, by giving this and the other 
<A NAME="47"></A>features their due proportion, we make the whole beautiful. And so I say 
<A NAME="48"></A>to you, do not compel us to assign to the guardians a sort of happiness 
<A NAME="49"></A>which will make them anything but guardians; for we too can clothe our 
<A NAME="50"></A>husbandmen in royal apparel, and set crowns of gold on their heads, and 
<A NAME="51"></A>bid them till the ground as much as they like, and no more. Our potters 
<A NAME="52"></A>also might be allowed to repose on couches, and feast by the fireside, 
<A NAME="53"></A>passing round the winecup, while their wheel is conveniently at hand, and 
<A NAME="54"></A>working at pottery only as much as they like; in this way we might make 
<A NAME="55"></A>every class happy-and then, as you imagine, the whole State would be happy. 
<A NAME="56"></A>But do not put this idea into our heads; for, if we listen to you, the 
<A NAME="57"></A>husbandman will be no longer a husbandman, the potter will cease to be 
<A NAME="58"></A>a potter, and no one will have the character of any distinct class in the 
<A NAME="59"></A>State. Now this is not of much consequence where the corruption of society, 
<A NAME="60"></A>and pretension to be what you are not, is confined to cobblers; but when 
<A NAME="61"></A>the guardians of the laws and of the government are only seemingly and 
<A NAME="62"></A>not real guardians, then see how they turn the State upside down; and on 
<A NAME="63"></A>the other hand they alone have the power of giving order and happiness 
<A NAME="64"></A>to the State. We mean our guardians to be true saviours and not the destroyers 
<A NAME="65"></A>of the State, whereas our opponent is thinking of peasants at a festival, 
<A NAME="66"></A>who are enjoying a life of revelry, not of citizens who are doing their 
<A NAME="67"></A>duty to the State. But, if so, we mean different things, and he is speaking 
<A NAME="68"></A>of something which is not a State. And therefore we must consider whether 
<A NAME="69"></A>in appointing our guardians we would look to their greatest happiness individually, 
<A NAME="70"></A>or whether this principle of happiness does not rather reside in the State 
<A NAME="71"></A>as a whole. But the latter be the truth, then the guardians and auxillaries, 
<A NAME="72"></A>and all others equally with them, must be compelled or induced to do their 
<A NAME="73"></A>own work in the best way. And thus the whole State will grow up in a noble 
<A NAME="74"></A>order, and the several classes will receive the proportion of happiness 
<A NAME="75"></A>which nature assigns to them.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR>I think that you are quite right.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>I wonder whether you will agree with another remark which occurs to 
<A NAME="78"></A>me.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>What may that be?
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>There seem to be two causes of the deterioration of the 
<A NAME="81"></A>arts.
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>What are they?
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>Wealth, I said, and poverty.
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>How do they act?
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>The process is as follows: When a potter becomes rich, will he, think 
<A NAME="86"></A>you, any longer take the same pains with his art?
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>He will grow more and more indolent and careless?
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>And the result will be that he becomes a worse potter?
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>Yes; he greatly deteriorates.
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>But, on the other hand, if he has no money, and cannot provide himself 
<A NAME="93"></A>tools or instruments, he will not work equally well himself, nor will he 
<A NAME="94"></A>teach his sons or apprentices to work equally well.
<A NAME="95"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>Then, under the influence either of poverty or of wealth, workmen and 
<A NAME="97"></A>their work are equally liable to degenerate?
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR>That is evident.
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>Here, then, is a discovery of new evils, I said, against which the 
<A NAME="100"></A>guardians will have to watch, or they will creep into the city 
<A NAME="101"></A>unobserved.
<A NAME="102"></A><BR><BR>What evils?
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>Wealth, I said, and poverty; the one is the parent of luxury and indolence, 
<A NAME="104"></A>and the other of meanness and viciousness, and both of 
<A NAME="105"></A>discontent.
<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR>That is very true, he replied; but still I should like to know, 
<A NAME="107"></A>Socrates, how our city will be able to go to war, especially against an 
<A NAME="108"></A>enemy who is rich and powerful, if deprived of the sinews of 
<A NAME="109"></A>war.
<A NAME="110"></A><BR><BR>There would certainly be a difficulty, I replied, in going to war 
<A NAME="111"></A>with one such enemy; but there is no difficulty where there are two of 
<A NAME="112"></A>them.
<A NAME="113"></A><BR><BR>How so? he asked.
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>In the first place, I said, if we have to fight, our side will be trained 
<A NAME="115"></A>warriors fighting against an army of rich men.
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR>That is true, he said.
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>And do you not suppose, Adeimantus, that a single boxer who was perfect 
<A NAME="118"></A>in his art would easily be a match for two stout and well-to-do gentlemen 
<A NAME="119"></A>who were not boxers?
<A NAME="120"></A><BR><BR>Hardly, if they came upon him at once.
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>What, not, I said, if he were able to run away and then turn and strike 
<A NAME="122"></A>at the one who first came up? And supposing he were to do this several 
<A NAME="123"></A>times under the heat of a scorching sun, might he not, being an expert, 
<A NAME="124"></A>overturn more than one stout personage?
<A NAME="125"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he said, there would be nothing wonderful in 
<A NAME="126"></A>that.
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>And yet rich men probably have a greater superiority in the science 
<A NAME="128"></A>and practice of boxing than they have in military qualities.
<A NAME="129"></A><BR><BR>Likely enough.
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>Then we may assume that our athletes will be able to fight with two 
<A NAME="131"></A>or three times their own number?
<A NAME="132"></A><BR><BR>I agree with you, for I think you right.
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>And suppose that, before engaging, our citizens send an embassy to 
<A NAME="134"></A>one of the two cities, telling them what is the truth: Silver and gold 
<A NAME="135"></A>we neither have nor are permitted to have, but you may; do you therefore 
<A NAME="136"></A>come and help us in war, of and take the spoils of the other city: Who, 
<A NAME="137"></A>on hearing these words, would choose to fight against lean wiry dogs, rather 
<A NAME="138"></A>th than, with the dogs on their side, against fat and tender 
<A NAME="139"></A>sheep?
<A NAME="140"></A><BR><BR>That is not likely; and yet there might be a danger to the poor 
<A NAME="141"></A>State if the wealth of many States were to be gathered into 
<A NAME="142"></A>one.
<A NAME="143"></A><BR><BR>But how simple of you to use the term State at all of any but our 
<A NAME="144"></A>own!
<A NAME="145"></A><BR><BR>Why so?
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>You ought to speak of other States in the plural number; not one of 
<A NAME="147"></A>them is a city, but many cities, as they say in the game. For indeed any 
<A NAME="148"></A>city, however small, is in fact divided into two, one the city of the poor, 
<A NAME="149"></A>the other of the rich; these are at war with one another; and in either 
<A NAME="150"></A>there are many smaller divisions, and you would be altogether beside the 
<A NAME="151"></A>mark if you treated them all as a single State. But if you deal with them 
<A NAME="152"></A>as many, and give the wealth or power or persons of the one to the others, 
<A NAME="153"></A>you will always have a great many friends and not many enemies. And your 
<A NAME="154"></A>State, while the wise order which has now been prescribed continues to 
<A NAME="155"></A>prevail in her, will be the greatest of States, I do not mean to say in 
<A NAME="156"></A>reputation or appearance, but in deed and truth, though she number not 
<A NAME="157"></A>more than a thousand defenders. A single State which is her equal you will 
<A NAME="158"></A>hardly find, either among Hellenes or barbarians, though many that appear 
<A NAME="159"></A>to be as great and many times greater.
<A NAME="160"></A><BR><BR>That is most true, he said.
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>And what, I said, will be the best limit for our rulers to fix when 
<A NAME="162"></A>they are considering the size of the State and the amount of territory 
<A NAME="163"></A>which they are to include, and beyond which they will not 
<A NAME="164"></A>go?
<A NAME="165"></A><BR><BR>What limit would you propose?
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>I would allow the State to increase so far as is consistent with unity; 
<A NAME="167"></A>that, I think, is the proper limit.
<A NAME="168"></A><BR><BR>Very good, he said.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>Here then, I said, is another order which will have to be conveyed 
<A NAME="170"></A>to our guardians: Let our city be accounted neither large nor small, but 
<A NAME="171"></A>one and self-sufficing.
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR>And surely, said he, this is not a very severe order which we impose 
<A NAME="173"></A>upon them.
<A NAME="174"></A><BR><BR>And the other, said I, of which we were speaking before is lighter 
<A NAME="175"></A>still, -I mean the duty of degrading the offspring of the guardians when 
<A NAME="176"></A>inferior, and of elevating into the rank of guardians the offspring of 
<A NAME="177"></A>the lower classes, when naturally superior. The intention was, that, in 
<A NAME="178"></A>the case of the citizens generally, each individual should be put to the 
<A NAME="179"></A>use for which nature which nature intended him, one to one work, and then 
<A NAME="180"></A>every man would do his own business, and be one and not many; and so the 
<A NAME="181"></A>whole city would be one and not many.
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said; that is not so difficult.
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>The regulations which we are prescribing, my good Adeimantus, are not, 
<A NAME="184"></A>as might be supposed, a number of great principles, but trifles all, if 
<A NAME="185"></A>care be taken, as the saying is, of the one great thing, --a thing, however, 
<A NAME="186"></A>which I would rather call, not great, but sufficient for our 
<A NAME="187"></A>purpose.
<A NAME="188"></A><BR><BR>What may that be? he asked.
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>Education, I said, and nurture: If our citizens are well educated, 
<A NAME="190"></A>and grow into sensible men, they will easily see their way through all 
<A NAME="191"></A>these, as well as other matters which I omit; such, for example, as marriage, 
<A NAME="192"></A>the possession of women and the procreation of children, which will all 
<A NAME="193"></A>follow the general principle that friends have all things in common, as 
<A NAME="194"></A>the proverb says.
<A NAME="195"></A><BR><BR>That will be the best way of settling them.
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>Also, I said, the State, if once started well, moves with accumulating 
<A NAME="197"></A>force like a wheel. For good nurture and education implant good constitutions, 
<A NAME="198"></A>and these good constitutions taking root in a good education improve more 
<A NAME="199"></A>and more, and this improvement affects the breed in man as in other 
<A NAME="200"></A>animals.
<A NAME="201"></A><BR><BR>Very possibly, he said.
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>Then to sum up: This is the point to which, above all, the attention 
<A NAME="203"></A>of our rulers should be directed, --that music and gymnastic be preserved 
<A NAME="204"></A>in their original form, and no innovation made. They must do their utmost 
<A NAME="205"></A>to maintain them intact. And when any one says that mankind most 
<A NAME="206"></A>regard
<A NAME="207"></A><BR><BR>The newest song which the singers have, they will be afraid that 
<A NAME="208"></A>he may be praising, not new songs, but a new kind of song; and this ought 
<A NAME="209"></A>not to be praised, or conceived to be the meaning of the poet; for any 
<A NAME="210"></A>musical innovation is full of danger to the whole State, and ought to be 
<A NAME="211"></A>prohibited. So Damon tells me, and I can quite believe him;-he says that 
<A NAME="212"></A>when modes of music change, of the State always change with 
<A NAME="213"></A>them.
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR>Yes, said Adeimantus; and you may add my suffrage to Damon's and 
<A NAME="215"></A>your own.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR><BR>Then, I said, our guardians must lay the foundations of their fortress 
<A NAME="217"></A>in music?
<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said; the lawlessness of which you speak too easily steals 
<A NAME="219"></A>in.
<A NAME="220"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I replied, in the form of amusement; and at first sight it 
<A NAME="221"></A>appears harmless.
<A NAME="222"></A><BR><BR>Why, yes, he said, and there is no harm; were it not that little 
<A NAME="223"></A>by little this spirit of licence, finding a home, imperceptibly penetrates 
<A NAME="224"></A>into manners and customs; whence, issuing with greater force, it invades 
<A NAME="225"></A>contracts between man and man, and from contracts goes on to laws and constitutions, 
<A NAME="226"></A>in utter recklessness, ending at last, Socrates, by an overthrow of all 
<A NAME="227"></A>rights, private as well as public.
<A NAME="228"></A><BR><BR>Is that true? I said.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>That is my belief, he replied.
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>Then, as I was saying, our youth should be trained from the first in 
<A NAME="231"></A>a stricter system, for if amusements become lawless, and the youths themselves 
<A NAME="232"></A>become lawless, they can never grow up into well-conducted and virtuous 
<A NAME="233"></A>citizens.
<A NAME="234"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he said.
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>And when they have made a good beginning in play, and by the help of 
<A NAME="236"></A>music have gained the habit of good order, then this habit of order, in 
<A NAME="237"></A>a manner how unlike the lawless play of the others! will accompany them 
<A NAME="238"></A>in all their actions and be a principle of growth to them, and if there 
<A NAME="239"></A>be any fallen places a principle in the State will raise them up 
<A NAME="240"></A>again.
<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he said.
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>Thus educated, they will invent for themselves any lesser rules which 
<A NAME="243"></A>their predecessors have altogether neglected.
<A NAME="244"></A><BR><BR>What do you mean?
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>I mean such things as these: --when the young are to be silent before 
<A NAME="246"></A>their elders; how they are to show respect to them by standing and making 
<A NAME="247"></A>them sit; what honour is due to parents; what garments or shoes are to 
<A NAME="248"></A>be worn; the mode of dressing the hair; deportment and manners in general. 
<A NAME="249"></A>You would agree with me?
<A NAME="250"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>But there is, I think, small wisdom in legislating about such matters, 
<A NAME="252"></A>--I doubt if it is ever done; nor are any precise written enactments about 
<A NAME="253"></A>them likely to be lasting.
<A NAME="254"></A><BR><BR>Impossible.
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>It would seem, Adeimantus, that the direction in which education starts 
<A NAME="256"></A>a man, will determine his future life. Does not like always attract 
<A NAME="257"></A>like?
<A NAME="258"></A><BR><BR>To be sure.
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>Until some one rare and grand result is reached which may be good, 
<A NAME="260"></A>and may be the reverse of good?
<A NAME="261"></A><BR><BR>That is not to be denied.
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>And for this reason, I said, I shall not attempt to legislate further 
<A NAME="263"></A>about them.
<A NAME="264"></A><BR><BR>Naturally enough, he replied.
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>Well, and about the business of the agora, dealings and the ordinary 
<A NAME="266"></A>dealings between man and man, or again about agreements with the commencement 
<A NAME="267"></A>with artisans; about insult and injury, of the commencement of actions, 
<A NAME="268"></A>and the appointment of juries, what would you say? there may also arise 
<A NAME="269"></A>questions about any impositions and extractions of market and harbour dues 
<A NAME="270"></A>which may be required, and in general about the regulations of markets, 
<A NAME="271"></A>police, harbours, and the like. But, oh heavens! shall we condescend to 
<A NAME="272"></A>legislate on any of these particulars?
<A NAME="273"></A><BR><BR>I think, he said, that there is no need to impose laws about them 
<A NAME="274"></A>on good men; what regulations are necessary they will find out soon enough 
<A NAME="275"></A>for themselves.
<A NAME="276"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I said, my friend, if God will only preserve to them the laws 
<A NAME="277"></A>which we have given them.
<A NAME="278"></A><BR><BR>And without divine help, said Adeimantus, they will go on for ever 
<A NAME="279"></A>making and mending their laws and their lives in the hope of attaining 
<A NAME="280"></A>perfection.
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR>You would compare them, I said, to those invalids who, having no 
<A NAME="282"></A>self-restraint, will not leave off their habits of intemperance?
<A NAME="283"></A><BR><BR>Exactly.
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>Yes, I said; and what a delightful life they lead! they are always 
<A NAME="285"></A>doctoring and increasing and complicating their disorders, and always fancying 
<A NAME="286"></A>that they will be cured by any nostrum which anybody advises them to 
<A NAME="287"></A>try.
<A NAME="288"></A><BR><BR>Such cases are very common, he said, with invalids of this 
<A NAME="289"></A>sort.
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>Yes, I replied; and the charming thing is that they deem him their 
<A NAME="291"></A>worst enemy who tells them the truth, which is simply that, unless they 
<A NAME="292"></A>give up eating and drinking and wenching and idling, neither drug nor cautery 
<A NAME="293"></A>nor spell nor amulet nor any other remedy will avail.
<A NAME="294"></A><BR><BR>Charming! he replied. I see nothing charming in going into a passion 
<A NAME="295"></A>with a man who tells you what is right.
<A NAME="296"></A><BR><BR>These gentlemen, I said, do not seem to be in your good 
<A NAME="297"></A>graces.
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>Assuredly not.
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>Nor would you praise the behaviour of States which act like the men 
<A NAME="300"></A>whom I was just now describing. For are there not ill-ordered States in 
<A NAME="301"></A>which the citizens are forbidden under pain of death to alter the constitution; 
<A NAME="302"></A>and yet he who most sweetly courts those who live under this regime and 
<A NAME="303"></A>indulges them and fawns upon them and is skilful in anticipating and gratifying 
<A NAME="304"></A>their humours is held to be a great and good statesman --do not these States 
<A NAME="305"></A>resemble the persons whom I was describing?
<A NAME="306"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said; the States are as bad as the men; and I am very far 
<A NAME="307"></A>from praising them.
<A NAME="308"></A><BR><BR>But do you not admire, I said, the coolness and dexterity of these 
<A NAME="309"></A>ready ministers of political corruption?
<A NAME="310"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, I do; but not of all of them, for there are some 
<A NAME="311"></A>whom the applause of the multitude has deluded into the belief that they 
<A NAME="312"></A>are really statesmen, and these are not much to be admired.
<A NAME="313"></A><BR><BR>What do you mean? I said; you should have more feeling for them. 
<A NAME="314"></A>When a man cannot measure, and a great many others who cannot measure declare 
<A NAME="315"></A>that he is four cubits high, can he help believing what they 
<A NAME="316"></A>say?
<A NAME="317"></A><BR><BR>Nay, he said, certainly not in that case.
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>Well, then, do not be angry with them; for are they not as good as 
<A NAME="319"></A>a play, trying their hand at paltry reforms such as I was describing; they 
<A NAME="320"></A>are always fancying that by legislation they will make an end of frauds 
<A NAME="321"></A>in contracts, and the other rascalities which I was mentioning, not knowing 
<A NAME="322"></A>that they are in reality cutting off the heads of a 
<A NAME="323"></A>hydra?
<A NAME="324"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said; that is just what they are doing.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>I conceive, I said, that the true legislator will not trouble himself 
<A NAME="326"></A>with this class of enactments whether concerning laws or the constitution 
<A NAME="327"></A>either in an ill-ordered or in a well-ordered State; for in the former 
<A NAME="328"></A>they are quite useless, and in the latter there will be no difficulty in 
<A NAME="329"></A>devising them; and many of them will naturally flow out of our previous 
<A NAME="330"></A>regulations.
<A NAME="331"></A><BR><BR>What, then, he said, is still remaining to us of the work of 
<A NAME="332"></A>legislation?
<A NAME="333"></A><BR><BR>Nothing to us, I replied; but to Apollo, the God of Delphi, there 
<A NAME="334"></A>remains the ordering of the greatest and noblest and chiefest things of 
<A NAME="335"></A>all.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR><BR>Which are they? he said.
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>The institution of temples and sacrifices, and the entire service of 
<A NAME="338"></A>gods, demigods, and heroes; also the ordering of the repositories of the 
<A NAME="339"></A>dead, and the rites which have to be observed by him who would propitiate 
<A NAME="340"></A>the inhabitants of the world below. These are matters of which we are ignorant 
<A NAME="341"></A>ourselves, and as founders of a city we should be unwise in trusting them 
<A NAME="342"></A>to any interpreter but our ancestral deity. He is the god who sits in the 
<A NAME="343"></A>center, on the navel of the earth, and he is the interpreter of religion 
<A NAME="344"></A>to all mankind.
<A NAME="345"></A><BR><BR>You are right, and we will do as you propose.
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>But where, amid all this, is justice? son of Ariston, tell me where. 
<A NAME="347"></A>Now that our city has been made habitable, light a candle and search, and 
<A NAME="348"></A>get your brother and Polemarchus and the rest of our friends to help, and 
<A NAME="349"></A>let us see where in it we can discover justice and where injustice, and 
<A NAME="350"></A>in what they differ from one another, and which of them the man who would 
<A NAME="351"></A>be happy should have for his portion, whether seen or unseen by gods and 
<A NAME="352"></A>men.
<A NAME="353"></A><BR><BR>Socrates - GLAUCON
<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR>Nonsense, said Glaucon: did you not promise to search yourself, 
<A NAME="355"></A>saying that for you not to help justice in her need would be an 
<A NAME="356"></A>impiety?
<A NAME="357"></A><BR><BR>I do not deny that I said so, and as you remind me, I will be as 
<A NAME="358"></A>good as my word; but you must join.
<A NAME="359"></A><BR><BR>We will, he replied.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>Well, then, I hope to make the discovery in this way: I mean to begin 
<A NAME="361"></A>with the assumption that our State, if rightly ordered, is 
<A NAME="362"></A>perfect.
<A NAME="363"></A><BR><BR>That is most certain.
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>And being perfect, is therefore wise and valiant and temperate and 
<A NAME="365"></A>just.
<A NAME="366"></A><BR><BR>That is likewise clear.
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>And whichever of these qualities we find in the State, the one which 
<A NAME="368"></A>is not found will be the residue?
<A NAME="369"></A><BR><BR>Very good.
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>If there were four things, and we were searching for one of them, wherever 
<A NAME="371"></A>it might be, the one sought for might be known to us from the first, and 
<A NAME="372"></A>there would be no further trouble; or we might know the other three first, 
<A NAME="373"></A>and then the fourth would clearly be the one left.
<A NAME="374"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he said.
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>And is not a similar method to be pursued about the virtues, which 
<A NAME="376"></A>are also four in number?
<A NAME="377"></A><BR><BR>Clearly.
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>First among the virtues found in the State, wisdom comes into view, 
<A NAME="379"></A>and in this I detect a certain peculiarity.
<A NAME="380"></A><BR><BR>What is that?
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>The State which we have been describing is said to be wise as being 
<A NAME="382"></A>good in counsel?
<A NAME="383"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>And good counsel is clearly a kind of knowledge, for not by ignorance, 
<A NAME="385"></A>but by knowledge, do men counsel well?
<A NAME="386"></A><BR><BR>Clearly.
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>And the kinds of knowledge in a State are many and 
<A NAME="388"></A>diverse?
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>Of course.
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>There is the knowledge of the carpenter; but is that the sort of knowledge 
<A NAME="391"></A>which gives a city the title of wise and good in counsel?
<A NAME="392"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not; that would only give a city the reputation of skill 
<A NAME="393"></A>in carpentering.
<A NAME="394"></A><BR><BR>Then a city is not to be called wise because possessing a knowledge 
<A NAME="395"></A>which counsels for the best about wooden implements?
<A NAME="396"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>Nor by reason of a knowledge which advises about brazen pots, I said, 
<A NAME="398"></A>nor as possessing any other similar knowledge?
<A NAME="399"></A><BR><BR>Not by reason of any of them, he said.
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>Nor yet by reason of a knowledge which cultivates the earth; that would 
<A NAME="401"></A>give the city the name of agricultural?
<A NAME="402"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>Well, I said, and is there any knowledge in our recently founded State 
<A NAME="404"></A>among any of the citizens which advises, not about any particular thing 
<A NAME="405"></A>in the State, but about the whole, and considers how a State can best deal 
<A NAME="406"></A>with itself and with other States?
<A NAME="407"></A><BR><BR>There certainly is.
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>And what is knowledge, and among whom is it found? I 
<A NAME="409"></A>asked.
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>It is the knowledge of the guardians, he replied, and found among those 
<A NAME="411"></A>whom we were just now describing as perfect guardians.
<A NAME="412"></A><BR><BR>And what is the name which the city derives from the possession 
<A NAME="413"></A>of this sort of knowledge?
<A NAME="414"></A><BR><BR>The name of good in counsel and truly wise.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>And will there be in our city more of these true guardians or more 
<A NAME="416"></A>smiths?
<A NAME="417"></A><BR><BR>The smiths, he replied, will be far more numerous.
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>Will not the guardians be the smallest of all the classes who receive 
<A NAME="419"></A>a name from the profession of some kind of knowledge?
<A NAME="420"></A><BR><BR>Much the smallest.
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>And so by reason of the smallest part or class, and of the knowledge 
<A NAME="422"></A>which resides in this presiding and ruling part of itself, the whole State, 
<A NAME="423"></A>being thus constituted according to nature, will be wise; and this, which 
<A NAME="424"></A>has the only knowledge worthy to be called wisdom, has been ordained by 
<A NAME="425"></A>nature to be of all classes the least.
<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR>Most true.
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>Thus, then, I said, the nature and place in the State of one of the 
<A NAME="428"></A>four virtues has somehow or other been discovered.
<A NAME="429"></A><BR><BR>And, in my humble opinion, very satisfactorily discovered, he 
<A NAME="430"></A>replied.
<A NAME="431"></A><BR><BR>Again, I said, there is no difficulty in seeing the nature of courage; 
<A NAME="432"></A>and in what part that quality resides which gives the name of courageous 
<A NAME="433"></A>to the State.
<A NAME="434"></A><BR><BR>How do you mean?
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>Why, I said, every one who calls any State courageous or cowardly, 
<A NAME="436"></A>will be thinking of the part which fights and goes out to war on the State's 
<A NAME="437"></A>behalf.
<A NAME="438"></A><BR><BR>No one, he replied, would ever think of any 
<A NAME="439"></A>other.
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>The rest of the citizens may be courageous or may be cowardly but their 
<A NAME="442"></A>courage or cowardice will not, as I conceive, have the effect of making 
<A NAME="443"></A>the city either the one or the other.
<A NAME="444"></A><BR><BR>The city will be courageous in virtue of a portion of herself which 
<A NAME="445"></A>preserves under all circumstances that opinion about the nature of things 
<A NAME="446"></A>to be feared and not to be feared in which our legislator educated them; 
<A NAME="447"></A>and this is what you term courage.
<A NAME="448"></A><BR><BR>I should like to hear what you are saying once more, for I do not 
<A NAME="449"></A>think that I perfectly understand you.
<A NAME="450"></A><BR><BR>I mean that courage is a kind of salvation.
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>Salvation of what?
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>Of the opinion respecting things to be feared, what they are and of 
<A NAME="453"></A>what nature, which the law implants through education; and I mean by the 
<A NAME="454"></A>words 'under all circumstances' to intimate that in pleasure or in pain, 
<A NAME="455"></A>or under the influence of desire or fear, a man preserves, and does not 
<A NAME="456"></A>lose this opinion. Shall I give you an illustration?
<A NAME="457"></A><BR><BR>If you please.
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>You know, I said, that dyers, when they want to dye wool for making 
<A NAME="459"></A>the true sea-purple, begin by selecting their white colour first; this 
<A NAME="460"></A>they prepare and dress with much care and pains, in order that the white 
<A NAME="461"></A>ground may take the purple hue in full perfection. The dyeing then proceeds; 
<A NAME="462"></A>and whatever is dyed in this manner becomes a fast colour, and no washing 
<A NAME="463"></A>either with lyes or without them can take away the bloom. But, when the 
<A NAME="464"></A>ground has not been duly prepared, you will have noticed how poor is the 
<A NAME="465"></A>look either of purple or of any other colour.
<A NAME="466"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said; I know that they have a washed-out and ridiculous 
<A NAME="467"></A>appearance.
<A NAME="468"></A><BR><BR>Then now, I said, you will understand what our object was in selecting 
<A NAME="469"></A>our soldiers, and educating them in music and gymnastic; we were contriving 
<A NAME="470"></A>influences which would prepare them to take the dye of the laws in perfection, 
<A NAME="471"></A>and the colour of their opinion about dangers and of every other opinion 
<A NAME="472"></A>was to be indelibly fixed by their nurture and training, not to be washed 
<A NAME="473"></A>away by such potent lyes as pleasure --mightier agent far in washing the 
<A NAME="474"></A>soul than any soda or lye; or by sorrow, fear, and desire, the mightiest 
<A NAME="475"></A>of all other solvents. And this sort of universal saving power of true 
<A NAME="476"></A>opinion in conformity with law about real and false dangers I call and 
<A NAME="477"></A>maintain to be courage, unless you disagree.
<A NAME="478"></A><BR><BR>But I agree, he replied; for I suppose that you mean to exclude 
<A NAME="479"></A>mere uninstructed courage, such as that of a wild beast or of a slave --this, 
<A NAME="480"></A>in your opinion, is not the courage which the law ordains, and ought to 
<A NAME="481"></A>have another name.
<A NAME="482"></A><BR><BR>Most certainly.
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>Then I may infer courage to be such as you describe?
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>Why, yes, said I, you may, and if you add the words 'of a citizen,' 
<A NAME="485"></A>you will not be far wrong; --hereafter, if you like, we will carry the 
<A NAME="486"></A>examination further, but at present we are we w seeking not for courage 
<A NAME="487"></A>but justice; and for the purpose of our enquiry we have said 
<A NAME="488"></A>enough.
<A NAME="489"></A><BR><BR>You are right, he replied.
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>Two virtues remain to be discovered in the State-first temperance, 
<A NAME="491"></A>and then justice which is the end of our search.
<A NAME="492"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>Now, can we find justice without troubling ourselves about 
<A NAME="494"></A>temperance?
<A NAME="495"></A><BR><BR>I do not know how that can be accomplished, he said, nor do I desire 
<A NAME="496"></A>that justice should be brought to light and temperance lost sight of; and 
<A NAME="497"></A>therefore I wish that you would do me the favour of considering temperance 
<A NAME="498"></A>first.
<A NAME="499"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, I replied, I should not be justified in refusing your 
<A NAME="500"></A>request.
<A NAME="501"></A><BR><BR>Then consider, he said.
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>Yes, I replied; I will; and as far as I can at present see, the virtue 
<A NAME="503"></A>of temperance has more of the nature of harmony and symphony than the 
<A NAME="504"></A>preceding.
<A NAME="505"></A><BR><BR>How so? he asked.
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>Temperance, I replied, is the ordering or controlling of certain pleasures 
<A NAME="507"></A>and desires; this is curiously enough implied in the saying of 'a man being 
<A NAME="508"></A>his own master' and other traces of the same notion may be found in 
<A NAME="509"></A>language.
<A NAME="510"></A><BR><BR>No doubt, he said.
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>There is something ridiculous in the expression 'master of himself'; 
<A NAME="512"></A>for the master is also the servant and the servant the master; and in all 
<A NAME="513"></A>these modes of speaking the same person is denoted.
<A NAME="514"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>The meaning is, I believe, that in the human soul there is a better 
<A NAME="516"></A>and also a worse principle; and when the better has the worse under control, 
<A NAME="517"></A>then a man is said to be master of himself; and this is a term of praise: 
<A NAME="518"></A>but when, owing to evil education or association, the better principle, 
<A NAME="519"></A>which is also the smaller, is overwhelmed by the greater mass of the worse 
<A NAME="520"></A>--in this case he is blamed and is called the slave of self and 
<A NAME="521"></A>unprincipled.
<A NAME="522"></A><BR><BR>Yes, there is reason in that.
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>And now, I said, look at our newly created State, and there you will 
<A NAME="524"></A>find one of these two conditions realised; for the State, as you will acknowledge, 
<A NAME="525"></A>may be justly called master of itself, if the words 'temperance' and 'self-mastery' 
<A NAME="526"></A>truly express the rule of the better part over the worse.
<A NAME="527"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, I see that what you say is true.
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>Let me further note that the manifold and complex pleasures and desires 
<A NAME="529"></A>and pains are generally found in children and women and servants, and in 
<A NAME="530"></A>the freemen so called who are of the lowest and more numerous 
<A NAME="531"></A>class.
<A NAME="532"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he said.
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>Whereas the simple and moderate desires which follow reason, and are 
<A NAME="534"></A>under the guidance of mind and true opinion, are to be found only in a 
<A NAME="535"></A>few, and those the best born and best educated.
<A NAME="536"></A><BR><BR>Very true. These two, as you may perceive, have a place in our 
<A NAME="537"></A>State; and the meaner desires of the are held down by the virtuous desires 
<A NAME="538"></A>and wisdom of the few.
<A NAME="539"></A><BR><BR>That I perceive, he said.
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>Then if there be any city which may be described as master of its own 
<A NAME="541"></A>pleasures and desires, and master of itself, ours may claim such a 
<A NAME="542"></A>designation?
<A NAME="543"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he replied.
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>It may also be called temperate, and for the same 
<A NAME="545"></A>reasons?
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>And if there be any State in which rulers and subjects will be agreed 
<A NAME="548"></A>as to the question who are to rule, that again will be our 
<A NAME="549"></A>State?
<A NAME="550"></A><BR><BR>Undoubtedly.
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>And the citizens being thus agreed among themselves, in which class 
<A NAME="552"></A>will temperance be found --in the rulers or in the subjects?
<A NAME="553"></A><BR><BR>In both, as I should imagine, he replied.
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>Do you observe that we were not far wrong in our guess that temperance 
<A NAME="555"></A>was a sort of harmony?
<A NAME="556"></A><BR><BR>Why so?
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>Why, because temperance is unlike courage and wisdom, each of which 
<A NAME="558"></A>resides in a part only, the one making the State wise and the other valiant; 
<A NAME="559"></A>not so temperance, which extends to the whole, and runs through all the 
<A NAME="560"></A>notes of the scale, and produces a harmony of the weaker and the stronger 
<A NAME="561"></A>and the middle class, whether you suppose them to be stronger or weaker 
<A NAME="562"></A>in wisdom or power or numbers or wealth, or anything else. Most truly then 
<A NAME="563"></A>may we deem temperance to be the agreement of the naturally superior and 
<A NAME="564"></A>inferior, as to the right to rule of either, both in states and 
<A NAME="565"></A>individuals.
<A NAME="566"></A><BR><BR>I entirely agree with you.
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>And so, I said, we may consider three out of the four virtues to have 
<A NAME="568"></A>been discovered in our State. The last of those qualities which make a 
<A NAME="569"></A>state virtuous must be justice, if we only knew what that 
<A NAME="570"></A>was.
<A NAME="571"></A><BR><BR>The inference is obvious.
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>The time then has arrived, Glaucon, when, like huntsmen, we should 
<A NAME="573"></A>surround the cover, and look sharp that justice does not steal away, and 
<A NAME="574"></A>pass out of sight and escape us; for beyond a doubt she is somewhere in 
<A NAME="575"></A>this country: watch therefore and strive to catch a sight of her, and if 
<A NAME="576"></A>you see her first, let me know.
<A NAME="577"></A><BR><BR>Would that I could! but you should regard me rather as a follower 
<A NAME="578"></A>who has just eyes enough to, see what you show him --that is about as much 
<A NAME="579"></A>as I am good for.
<A NAME="580"></A><BR><BR>Offer up a prayer with me and follow.
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>I will, but you must show me the way.
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>Here is no path, I said, and the wood is dark and perplexing; still 
<A NAME="583"></A>we must push on.
<A NAME="584"></A><BR><BR>Let us push on.
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>Here I saw something: Halloo! I said, I begin to perceive a track, 
<A NAME="586"></A>and I believe that the quarry will not escape.
<A NAME="587"></A><BR><BR>Good news, he said.
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>Truly, I said, we are stupid fellows.
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>Why so?
<A NAME="590"></A><BR>Why, my good sir, at the beginning of our enquiry, ages ago, there 
<A NAME="591"></A>was justice tumbling out at our feet, and we never saw her; nothing could 
<A NAME="592"></A>be more ridiculous. Like people who go about looking for what they have 
<A NAME="593"></A>in their hands --that was the way with us --we looked not at what we were 
<A NAME="594"></A>seeking, but at what was far off in the distance; and therefore, I suppose, 
<A NAME="595"></A>we missed her.
<A NAME="596"></A><BR><BR>What do you mean?
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>I mean to say that in reality for a long time past we have been talking 
<A NAME="598"></A>of justice, and have failed to recognise her.
<A NAME="599"></A><BR><BR>I grow impatient at the length of your exordium.
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>Well then, tell me, I said, whether I am right or not: You remember 
<A NAME="601"></A>the original principle which we were always laying down at the foundation 
<A NAME="602"></A>of the State, that one man should practise one thing only, the thing to 
<A NAME="603"></A>which his nature was best adapted; --now justice is this principle or a 
<A NAME="604"></A>part of it.
<A NAME="605"></A><BR><BR>Yes, we often said that one man should do one thing 
<A NAME="606"></A>only.
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>Further, we affirmed that justice was doing one's own business, and 
<A NAME="608"></A>not being a busybody; we said so again and again, and many others have 
<A NAME="609"></A>said the same to us.
<A NAME="610"></A><BR><BR>Yes, we said so.
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>Then to do one's own business in a certain way may be assumed to be 
<A NAME="612"></A>justice. Can you tell me whence I derive this inference?
<A NAME="613"></A><BR><BR>I cannot, but I should like to be told.
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>Because I think that this is the only virtue which remains in the State 
<A NAME="615"></A>when the other virtues of temperance and courage and wisdom are abstracted; 
<A NAME="616"></A>and, that this is the ultimate cause and condition of the existence of 
<A NAME="617"></A>all of them, and while remaining in them is also their preservative; and 
<A NAME="618"></A>we were saying that if the three were discovered by us, justice would be 
<A NAME="619"></A>the fourth or remaining one.
<A NAME="620"></A><BR><BR>That follows of necessity.
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>If we are asked to determine which of these four qualities by its presence 
<A NAME="622"></A>contributes most to the excellence of the State, whether the agreement 
<A NAME="623"></A>of rulers and subjects, or the preservation in the soldiers of the opinion 
<A NAME="624"></A>which the law ordains about the true nature of dangers, or wisdom and watchfulness 
<A NAME="625"></A>in the rulers, or whether this other which I am mentioning, and which is 
<A NAME="626"></A>found in children and women, slave and freeman, artisan, ruler, subject, 
<A NAME="627"></A>--the quality, I mean, of every one doing his own work, and not being a 
<A NAME="628"></A>busybody, would claim the palm --the question is not so easily 
<A NAME="629"></A>answered.
<A NAME="630"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he replied, there would be a difficulty in saying 
<A NAME="631"></A>which.
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>Then the power of each individual in the State to do his own work appears 
<A NAME="633"></A>to compete with the other political virtues, wisdom, temperance, 
<A NAME="634"></A>courage.
<A NAME="635"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said.
<A NAME="636"></A><BR>And the virtue which enters into this competition is 
<A NAME="637"></A>justice?
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>Exactly.
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>Let us look at the question from another point of view: Are not the 
<A NAME="640"></A>rulers in a State those to whom you would entrust the office of determining 
<A NAME="641"></A>suits at law?
<A NAME="642"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>And are suits decided on any other ground but that a man may neither 
<A NAME="644"></A>take what is another's, nor be deprived of what is his 
<A NAME="645"></A>own?
<A NAME="646"></A><BR><BR>Yes; that is their principle.
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>Which is a just principle?
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>Then on this view also justice will be admitted to be the having and 
<A NAME="650"></A>doing what is a man's own, and belongs to him?
<A NAME="651"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>Think, now, and say whether you agree with me or not. Suppose a carpenter 
<A NAME="653"></A>to be doing the business of a cobbler, or a cobbler of a carpenter; and 
<A NAME="654"></A>suppose them to exchange their implements or their duties, or the same 
<A NAME="655"></A>person to be doing the work of both, or whatever be the change; do you 
<A NAME="656"></A>think that any great harm would result to the State?
<A NAME="657"></A><BR><BR>Not much.
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>But when the cobbler or any other man whom nature designed to be a 
<A NAME="659"></A>trader, having his heart lifted up by wealth or strength or the number 
<A NAME="660"></A>of his followers, or any like advantage, attempts to force his way into 
<A NAME="661"></A>the class of warriors, or a warrior into that of legislators and guardians, 
<A NAME="662"></A>for which he is unfitted, and either to take the implements or the duties 
<A NAME="663"></A>of the other; or when one man is trader, legislator, and warrior all in 
<A NAME="664"></A>one, then I think you will agree with me in saying that this interchange 
<A NAME="665"></A>and this meddling of one with another is the ruin of the 
<A NAME="666"></A>State.
<A NAME="667"></A><BR><BR>Most true.
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>Seeing then, I said, that there are three distinct classes, any meddling 
<A NAME="669"></A>of one with another, or the change of one into another, is the greatest 
<A NAME="670"></A>harm to the State, and may be most justly termed evil-doing?
<A NAME="671"></A><BR><BR>Precisely.
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>And the greatest degree of evil-doing to one's own city would be termed 
<A NAME="673"></A>by you injustice?
<A NAME="674"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>This then is injustice; and on the other hand when the trader, the 
<A NAME="676"></A>auxiliary, and the guardian each do their own business, that is justice, 
<A NAME="677"></A>and will make the city just.
<A NAME="678"></A><BR><BR>I agree with you.
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>We will not, I said, be over-positive as yet; but if, on trial, this 
<A NAME="680"></A>conception of justice be verified in the individual as well as in the State, 
<A NAME="681"></A>there will be no longer any room for doubt; if it be not verified, we must 
<A NAME="682"></A>have a fresh enquiry. First let us complete the old investigation, which 
<A NAME="683"></A>we began, as you remember, under the impression that, if we could previously 
<A NAME="684"></A>examine justice on the larger scale, there would be less difficulty in 
<A NAME="685"></A>discerning her in the individual. That larger example appeared to be the 
<A NAME="686"></A>State, and accordingly we constructed as good a one as we could, knowing 
<A NAME="687"></A>well that in the good State justice would be found. Let the discovery which 
<A NAME="688"></A>we made be now applied to the individual --if they agree, we shall be satisfied; 
<A NAME="689"></A>or, if there be a difference in the individual, we will come back to the 
<A NAME="690"></A>State and have another trial of the theory. The friction of the two when 
<A NAME="691"></A>rubbed together may possibly strike a light in which justice will shine 
<A NAME="692"></A>forth, and the vision which is then revealed we will fix in our 
<A NAME="693"></A>souls.
<A NAME="694"></A><BR><BR>That will be in regular course; let us do as you 
<A NAME="695"></A>say.
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>I proceeded to ask: When two things, a greater and less, are called 
<A NAME="697"></A>by the same name, are they like or unlike in so far as they are called 
<A NAME="698"></A>the same?
<A NAME="699"></A><BR><BR>Like, he replied.
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>The just man then, if we regard the idea of justice only, will be like 
<A NAME="701"></A>the just State?
<A NAME="702"></A><BR><BR>He will.
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>And a State was thought by us to be just when the three classes in 
<A NAME="704"></A>the State severally did their own business; and also thought to be temperate 
<A NAME="705"></A>and valiant and wise by reason of certain other affections and qualities 
<A NAME="706"></A>of these same classes?
<A NAME="707"></A><BR><BR>True, he said.
<A NAME="708"></A><BR>And so of the individual; we may assume that he has the same three 
<A NAME="709"></A>principles in his own soul which are found in the State; and he may be 
<A NAME="710"></A>rightly described in the same terms, because he is affected in the same 
<A NAME="711"></A>manner?
<A NAME="712"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he said.
<A NAME="713"></A><BR>Once more then, O my friend, we have alighted upon an easy question 
<A NAME="714"></A>--whether the soul has these three principles or not?
<A NAME="715"></A><BR><BR>An easy question! Nay, rather, Socrates, the proverb holds that 
<A NAME="716"></A>hard is the good.
<A NAME="717"></A><BR><BR>Very true, I said; and I do not think that the method which we 
<A NAME="718"></A>are employing is at all adequate to the accurate solution of this question; 
<A NAME="719"></A>the true method is another and a longer one. Still we may arrive at a solution 
<A NAME="720"></A>not below the level of the previous enquiry.
<A NAME="721"></A><BR><BR>May we not be satisfied with that? he said; --under the circumstances, 
<A NAME="722"></A>I am quite content.
<A NAME="723"></A><BR><BR>I too, I replied, shall be extremely well satisfied.
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>Then faint not in pursuing the speculation, he said.
<A NAME="725"></A><BR>Must we not acknowledge, I said, that in each of us there are the same 
<A NAME="726"></A>principles and habits which there are in the State; and that from the individual 
<A NAME="727"></A>they pass into the State? --how else can they come there? Take the quality 
<A NAME="728"></A>of passion or spirit; --it would be ridiculous to imagine that this quality, 
<A NAME="729"></A>when found in States, is not derived from the individuals who are supposed 
<A NAME="730"></A>to possess it, e.g. the Thracians, Scythians, and in general the northern 
<A NAME="731"></A>nations; and the same may be said of the love of knowledge, which is the 
<A NAME="732"></A>special characteristic of our part of the world, or of the love of money, 
<A NAME="733"></A>which may, with equal truth, be attributed to the Phoenicians and 
<A NAME="734"></A>Egyptians.
<A NAME="735"></A><BR><BR>Exactly so, he said.
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>There is no difficulty in understanding this.
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>None whatever.
<A NAME="738"></A><BR>But the question is not quite so easy when we proceed to ask whether 
<A NAME="739"></A>these principles are three or one; whether, that is to say, we learn with 
<A NAME="740"></A>one part of our nature, are angry with another, and with a third part desire 
<A NAME="741"></A>the satisfaction of our natural appetites; or whether the whole soul comes 
<A NAME="742"></A>into play in each sort of action --to determine that is the 
<A NAME="743"></A>difficulty.
<A NAME="744"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said; there lies the difficulty.
<A NAME="745"></A><BR>Then let us now try and determine whether they are the same or 
<A NAME="746"></A>different.
<A NAME="747"></A><BR><BR>How can we? he asked.
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>I replied as follows: The same thing clearly cannot act or be acted 
<A NAME="749"></A>upon in the same part or in relation to the same thing at the same time, 
<A NAME="750"></A>in contrary ways; and therefore whenever this contradiction occurs in things 
<A NAME="751"></A>apparently the same, we know that they are really not the same, but 
<A NAME="752"></A>different.
<A NAME="753"></A><BR><BR>Good.
<A NAME="754"></A><BR>For example, I said, can the same thing be at rest and in motion at 
<A NAME="755"></A>the same time in the same part?
<A NAME="756"></A><BR><BR>Impossible.
<A NAME="757"></A><BR>Still, I said, let us have a more precise statement of terms, lest 
<A NAME="758"></A>we should hereafter fall out by the way. Imagine the case of a man who 
<A NAME="759"></A>is standing and also moving his hands and his head, and suppose a person 
<A NAME="760"></A>to say that one and the same person is in motion and at rest at the same 
<A NAME="761"></A>moment-to such a mode of speech we should object, and should rather say 
<A NAME="762"></A>that one part of him is in motion while another is at 
<A NAME="763"></A>rest.
<A NAME="764"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="765"></A><BR>And suppose the objector to refine still further, and to draw the nice 
<A NAME="766"></A>distinction that not only parts of tops, but whole tops, when they spin 
<A NAME="767"></A>round with their pegs fixed on the spot, are at rest and in motion at the 
<A NAME="768"></A>same time (and he may say the same of anything which revolves in the same 
<A NAME="769"></A>spot), his objection would not be admitted by us, because in such cases 
<A NAME="770"></A>things are not at rest and in motion in the same parts of themselves; we 
<A NAME="771"></A>should rather say that they have both an axis and a circumference, and 
<A NAME="772"></A>that the axis stands still, for there is no deviation from the perpendicular; 
<A NAME="773"></A>and that the circumference goes round. But if, while revolving, the axis 
<A NAME="774"></A>inclines either to the right or left, forwards or backwards, then in no 
<A NAME="775"></A>point of view can they be at rest.
<A NAME="776"></A><BR><BR>That is the correct mode of describing them, he 
<A NAME="777"></A>replied.
<A NAME="778"></A><BR>Then none of these objections will confuse us, or incline us to believe 
<A NAME="779"></A>that the same thing at the same time, in the same part or in relation to 
<A NAME="780"></A>the same thing, can act or be acted upon in contrary 
<A NAME="781"></A>ways.
<A NAME="782"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not, according to my way of thinking.
<A NAME="783"></A><BR>Yet, I said, that we may not be compelled to examine all such objections, 
<A NAME="784"></A>and prove at length that they are untrue, let us assume their absurdity, 
<A NAME="785"></A>and go forward on the understanding that hereafter, if this assumption 
<A NAME="786"></A>turn out to be untrue, all the consequences which follow shall be 
<A NAME="787"></A>withdrawn.
<A NAME="788"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, that will be the best way.
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>Well, I said, would you not allow that assent and dissent, desire and 
<A NAME="790"></A>aversion, attraction and repulsion, are all of them opposites, whether 
<A NAME="791"></A>they are regarded as active or passive (for that makes no difference in 
<A NAME="792"></A>the fact of their opposition)?
<A NAME="793"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, they are opposites.
<A NAME="794"></A><BR>Well, I said, and hunger and thirst, and the desires in general, and 
<A NAME="795"></A>again willing and wishing, --all these you would refer to the classes already 
<A NAME="796"></A>mentioned. You would say --would you not? --that the soul of him who desires 
<A NAME="797"></A>is seeking after the object of his desires; or that he is drawing to himself 
<A NAME="798"></A>the thing which he wishes to possess: or again, when a person wants anything 
<A NAME="799"></A>to be given him, his mind, longing for the realisation of his desires, 
<A NAME="800"></A>intimates his wish to have it by a nod of assent, as if he had been asked 
<A NAME="801"></A>a question?
<A NAME="802"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="803"></A><BR>And what would you say of unwillingness and dislike and the absence 
<A NAME="804"></A>of desire; should not these be referred to the opposite class of repulsion 
<A NAME="805"></A>and rejection?
<A NAME="806"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="807"></A><BR>Admitting this to be true of desire generally, let us suppose a particular 
<A NAME="808"></A>class of desires, and out of these we will select hunger and thirst, as 
<A NAME="809"></A>they are termed, which are the most obvious of them?
<A NAME="810"></A><BR><BR>Let us take that class, he said.
<A NAME="811"></A><BR>The object of one is food, and of the other drink?
<A NAME="812"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="813"></A><BR>And here comes the point: is not thirst the desire which the soul has 
<A NAME="814"></A>of drink, and of drink only; not of drink qualified by anything else; for 
<A NAME="815"></A>example, warm or cold, or much or little, or, in a word, drink of any particular 
<A NAME="816"></A>sort: but if the thirst be accompanied by heat, then the desire is of cold 
<A NAME="817"></A>drink; or, if accompanied by cold, then of warm drink; or, if the thirst 
<A NAME="818"></A>be excessive, then the drink which is desired will be excessive; or, if 
<A NAME="819"></A>not great, the quantity of drink will also be small: but thirst pure and 
<A NAME="820"></A>simple will desire drink pure and simple, which is the natural satisfaction 
<A NAME="821"></A>of thirst, as food is of hunger?
<A NAME="822"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said; the simple desire is, as you say, in every case of 
<A NAME="823"></A>the simple object, and the qualified desire of the qualified 
<A NAME="824"></A>object.
<A NAME="825"></A><BR><BR>But here a confusion may arise; and I should wish to guard against 
<A NAME="826"></A>an opponent starting up and saying that no man desires drink only, but 
<A NAME="827"></A>good drink, or food only, but good food; for good is the universal object 
<A NAME="828"></A>of desire, and thirst being a desire, will necessarily be thirst after 
<A NAME="829"></A>good drink; and the same is true of every other desire.
<A NAME="830"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he replied, the opponent might have something to 
<A NAME="831"></A>say.
<A NAME="832"></A><BR>Nevertheless I should still maintain, that of relatives some have a 
<A NAME="833"></A>quality attached to either term of the relation; others are simple and 
<A NAME="834"></A>have their correlatives simple.
<A NAME="835"></A><BR><BR>I do not know what you mean.
<A NAME="836"></A><BR>Well, you know of course that the greater is relative to the 
<A NAME="837"></A>less?
<A NAME="838"></A><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="839"></A><BR>And the much greater to the much less?
<A NAME="840"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="841"></A><BR>And the sometime greater to the sometime less, and the greater that 
<A NAME="842"></A>is to be to the less that is to be?
<A NAME="843"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he said.
<A NAME="844"></A><BR>And so of more and less, and of other correlative terms, such as the 
<A NAME="845"></A>double and the half, or again, the heavier and the lighter, the swifter 
<A NAME="846"></A>and the slower; and of hot and cold, and of any other relatives; --is not 
<A NAME="847"></A>this true of all of them?
<A NAME="848"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="849"></A><BR>And does not the same principle hold in the sciences? The object of 
<A NAME="850"></A>science is knowledge (assuming that to be the true definition), but the 
<A NAME="851"></A>object of a particular science is a particular kind of knowledge; I mean, 
<A NAME="852"></A>for example, that the science of house-building is a kind of knowledge 
<A NAME="853"></A>which is defined and distinguished from other kinds and is therefore termed 
<A NAME="854"></A>architecture.
<A NAME="855"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="856"></A><BR>Because it has a particular quality which no other 
<A NAME="857"></A>has?
<A NAME="858"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="859"></A><BR>And it has this particular quality because it has an object of a particular 
<A NAME="860"></A>kind; and this is true of the other arts and sciences?
<A NAME="861"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="862"></A><BR>Now, then, if I have made myself clear, you will understand my original 
<A NAME="863"></A>meaning in what I said about relatives. My meaning was, that if one term 
<A NAME="864"></A>of a relation is taken alone, the other is taken alone; if one term is 
<A NAME="865"></A>qualified, the other is also qualified. I do not mean to say that relatives 
<A NAME="866"></A>may not be disparate, or that the science of health is healthy, or of disease 
<A NAME="867"></A>necessarily diseased, or that the sciences of good and evil are therefore 
<A NAME="868"></A>good and evil; but only that, when the term science is no longer used absolutely, 
<A NAME="869"></A>but has a qualified object which in this case is the nature of health and 
<A NAME="870"></A>disease, it becomes defined, and is hence called not merely science, but 
<A NAME="871"></A>the science of medicine.
<A NAME="872"></A><BR><BR>I quite understand, and I think as you do.
<A NAME="873"></A><BR>Would you not say that thirst is one of these essentially relative 
<A NAME="874"></A>terms, having clearly a relation --
<A NAME="875"></A><BR><BR>Yes, thirst is relative to drink.
<A NAME="876"></A><BR>And a certain kind of thirst is relative to a certain kind of drink; 
<A NAME="877"></A>but thirst taken alone is neither of much nor little, nor of good nor bad, 
<A NAME="878"></A>nor of any particular kind of drink, but of drink only?
<A NAME="879"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="880"></A><BR>Then the soul of the thirsty one, in so far as he is thirsty, desires 
<A NAME="881"></A>only drink; for this he yearns and tries to obtain it?
<A NAME="882"></A><BR><BR>That is plain.
<A NAME="883"></A><BR>And if you suppose something which pulls a thirsty soul away from drink, 
<A NAME="884"></A>that must be different from the thirsty principle which draws him like 
<A NAME="885"></A>a beast to drink; for, as we were saying, the same thing cannot at the 
<A NAME="886"></A>same time with the same part of itself act in contrary ways about the 
<A NAME="887"></A>same.
<A NAME="888"></A><BR><BR>Impossible.
<A NAME="889"></A><BR>No more than you can say that the hands of the archer push and pull 
<A NAME="890"></A>the bow at the same time, but what you say is that one hand pushes and 
<A NAME="891"></A>the other pulls.
<A NAME="892"></A><BR><BR>Exactly so, he replied.
<A NAME="893"></A><BR>And might a man be thirsty, and yet unwilling to 
<A NAME="894"></A>drink?
<A NAME="895"></A><BR>Yes, he said, it constantly happens.
<A NAME="896"></A><BR>And in such a case what is one to say? Would you not say that there 
<A NAME="897"></A>was something in the soul bidding a man to drink, and something else forbidding 
<A NAME="898"></A>him, which is other and stronger than the principle which bids 
<A NAME="899"></A>him?
<A NAME="900"></A><BR><BR>I should say so.
<A NAME="901"></A><BR>And the forbidding principle is derived from reason, and that which 
<A NAME="902"></A>bids and attracts proceeds from passion and disease?
<A NAME="903"></A><BR><BR>Clearly.
<A NAME="904"></A><BR>Then we may fairly assume that they are two, and that they differ from 
<A NAME="905"></A>one another; the one with which man reasons, we may call the rational principle 
<A NAME="906"></A>of the soul, the other, with which he loves and hungers and thirsts and 
<A NAME="907"></A>feels the flutterings of any other desire, may be termed the irrational 
<A NAME="908"></A>or appetitive, the ally of sundry pleasures and satisfactions?
<A NAME="909"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, we may fairly assume them to be 
<A NAME="910"></A>different.
<A NAME="911"></A><BR>Then let us finally determine that there are two principles existing 
<A NAME="912"></A>in the soul. And what of passion, or spirit? Is it a third, or akin to 
<A NAME="913"></A>one of the preceding?
<A NAME="914"></A><BR><BR>I should be inclined to say --akin to desire.
<A NAME="915"></A><BR>Well, I said, there is a story which I remember to have heard, and 
<A NAME="916"></A>in which I put faith. The story is, that Leontius, the son of Aglaion, 
<A NAME="917"></A>coming up one day from the Piraeus, under the north wall on the outside, 
<A NAME="918"></A>observed some dead bodies lying on the ground at the place of execution. 
<A NAME="919"></A>He felt a desire to see them, and also a dread and abhorrence of them; 
<A NAME="920"></A>for a time he struggled and covered his eyes, but at length the desire 
<A NAME="921"></A>got the better of him; and forcing them open, he ran up to the dead bodies, 
<A NAME="922"></A>saying, Look, ye wretches, take your fill of the fair 
<A NAME="923"></A>sight.
<A NAME="924"></A><BR><BR>I have heard the story myself, he said.
<A NAME="925"></A><BR>The moral of the tale is, that anger at times goes to war with desire, 
<A NAME="926"></A>as though they were two distinct things.
<A NAME="927"></A><BR><BR>Yes; that is the meaning, he said.
<A NAME="928"></A><BR>And are there not many other cases in which we observe that when a 
<A NAME="929"></A>man's desires violently prevail over his reason, he reviles himself, and 
<A NAME="930"></A>is angry at the violence within him, and that in this struggle, which is 
<A NAME="931"></A>like the struggle of factions in a State, his spirit is on the side of 
<A NAME="932"></A>his reason; --but for the passionate or spirited element to take part with 
<A NAME="933"></A>the desires when reason that she should not be opposed, is a sort of thing 
<A NAME="934"></A>which thing which I believe that you never observed occurring in yourself, 
<A NAME="935"></A>nor, as I should imagine, in any one else?
<A NAME="936"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="937"></A><BR>Suppose that a man thinks he has done a wrong to another, the nobler 
<A NAME="938"></A>he is the less able is he to feel indignant at any suffering, such as hunger, 
<A NAME="939"></A>or cold, or any other pain which the injured person may inflict upon him 
<A NAME="940"></A>--these he deems to be just, and, as I say, his anger refuses to be excited 
<A NAME="941"></A>by them.
<A NAME="942"></A><BR><BR>True, he said.
<A NAME="943"></A><BR>But when he thinks that he is the sufferer of the wrong, then he boils 
<A NAME="944"></A>and chafes, and is on the side of what he believes to be justice; and because 
<A NAME="945"></A>he suffers hunger or cold or other pain he is only the more determined 
<A NAME="946"></A>to persevere and conquer. His noble spirit will not be quelled until he 
<A NAME="947"></A>either slays or is slain; or until he hears the voice of the shepherd, 
<A NAME="948"></A>that is, reason, bidding his dog bark no more.
<A NAME="949"></A><BR><BR>The illustration is perfect, he replied; and in our State, as we 
<A NAME="950"></A>were saying, the auxiliaries were to be dogs, and to hear the voice of 
<A NAME="951"></A>the rulers, who are their shepherds.
<A NAME="952"></A><BR><BR>I perceive, I said, that you quite understand me; there is, however, 
<A NAME="953"></A>a further point which I wish you to consider.
<A NAME="954"></A><BR><BR>What point?
<A NAME="955"></A><BR>You remember that passion or spirit appeared at first sight to be a 
<A NAME="956"></A>kind of desire, but now we should say quite the contrary; for in the conflict 
<A NAME="957"></A>of the soul spirit is arrayed on the side of the rational 
<A NAME="958"></A>principle.
<A NAME="959"></A><BR><BR>Most assuredly.
<A NAME="960"></A><BR>But a further question arises: Is passion different from reason also, 
<A NAME="961"></A>or only a kind of reason; in which latter case, instead of three principles 
<A NAME="962"></A>in the soul, there will only be two, the rational and the concupiscent; 
<A NAME="963"></A>or rather, as the State was composed of three classes, traders, auxiliaries, 
<A NAME="964"></A>counsellors, so may there not be in the individual soul a third element 
<A NAME="965"></A>which is passion or spirit, and when not corrupted by bad education is 
<A NAME="966"></A>the natural auxiliary of reason
<A NAME="967"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, there must be a third.
<A NAME="968"></A><BR>Yes, I replied, if passion, which has already been shown to be different 
<A NAME="969"></A>from desire, turn out also to be different from reason.
<A NAME="970"></A><BR><BR>But that is easily proved: --We may observe even in young children 
<A NAME="971"></A>that they are full of spirit almost as soon as they are born, whereas some 
<A NAME="972"></A>of them never seem to attain to the use of reason, and most of them late 
<A NAME="973"></A>enough.
<A NAME="974"></A><BR><BR>Excellent, I said, and you may see passion equally in brute animals, 
<A NAME="975"></A>which is a further proof of the truth of what you are saying. And we may 
<A NAME="976"></A>once more appeal to the words of Homer, which have been already quoted 
<A NAME="977"></A>by us,
<A NAME="978"></A><BR><BR>He smote his breast, and thus rebuked his soul, for in this verse 
<A NAME="979"></A>Homer has clearly supposed the power which reasons about the better and 
<A NAME="980"></A>worse to be different from the unreasoning anger which is rebuked by 
<A NAME="981"></A>it.
<A NAME="982"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he said.
<A NAME="983"></A><BR>And so, after much tossing, we have reached land, and are fairly agreed 
<A NAME="984"></A>that the same principles which exist in the State exist also in the individual, 
<A NAME="985"></A>and that they are three in number.
<A NAME="986"></A><BR><BR>Exactly.
<A NAME="987"></A><BR>Must we not then infer that the individual is wise in the same way, 
<A NAME="988"></A>and in virtue of the same quality which makes the State 
<A NAME="989"></A>wise?
<A NAME="990"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="991"></A><BR>Also that the same quality which constitutes courage in the State constitutes 
<A NAME="992"></A>courage in the individual, and that both the State and the individual bear 
<A NAME="993"></A>the same relation to all the other virtues?
<A NAME="994"></A><BR><BR>Assuredly.
<A NAME="995"></A><BR>And the individual will be acknowledged by us to be just in the same 
<A NAME="996"></A>way in which the State is just?
<A NAME="997"></A><BR><BR>That follows, of course.
<A NAME="998"></A><BR>We cannot but remember that the justice of the State consisted in each 
<A NAME="999"></A>of the three classes doing the work of its own class?
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR><BR>We are not very likely to have forgotten, he 
<A NAME="1001"></A>said.
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR>We must recollect that the individual in whom the several qualities 
<A NAME="1003"></A>of his nature do their own work will be just, and will do his own 
<A NAME="1004"></A>work?
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, we must remember that too.
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR>And ought not the rational principle, which is wise, and has the care 
<A NAME="1007"></A>of the whole soul, to rule, and the passionate or spirited principle to 
<A NAME="1008"></A>be the subject and ally?
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR>And, as we were saying, the united influence of music and gymnastic 
<A NAME="1011"></A>will bring them into accord, nerving and sustaining the reason with noble 
<A NAME="1012"></A>words and lessons, and moderating and soothing and civilizing the wildness 
<A NAME="1013"></A>of passion by harmony and rhythm?
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR><BR>Quite true, he said.
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR>And these two, thus nurtured and educated, and having learned truly 
<A NAME="1016"></A>to know their own functions, will rule over the concupiscent, which in 
<A NAME="1017"></A>each of us is the largest part of the soul and by nature most insatiable 
<A NAME="1018"></A>of gain; over this they will keep guard, lest, waxing great and strong 
<A NAME="1019"></A>with the fulness of bodily pleasures, as they are termed, the concupiscent 
<A NAME="1020"></A>soul, no longer confined to her own sphere, should attempt to enslave and 
<A NAME="1021"></A>rule those who are not her natural-born subjects, and overturn the whole 
<A NAME="1022"></A>life of man?
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he said.
<A NAME="1024"></A><BR>Both together will they not be the best defenders of the whole soul 
<A NAME="1025"></A>and the whole body against attacks from without; the one counselling, and 
<A NAME="1026"></A>the other fighting under his leader, and courageously executing his commands 
<A NAME="1027"></A>and counsels?
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR>And he is to be deemed courageous whose spirit retains in pleasure 
<A NAME="1030"></A>and in pain the commands of reason about what he ought or ought not to 
<A NAME="1031"></A>fear?
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR><BR>Right, he replied.
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR>And him we call wise who has in him that little part which rules, and 
<A NAME="1034"></A>which proclaims these commands; that part too being supposed to have a 
<A NAME="1035"></A>knowledge of what is for the interest of each of the three parts and of 
<A NAME="1036"></A>the whole?
<A NAME="1037"></A><BR><BR>Assuredly.
<A NAME="1038"></A><BR>And would you not say that he is temperate who has these same elements 
<A NAME="1039"></A>in friendly harmony, in whom the one ruling principle of reason, and the 
<A NAME="1040"></A>two subject ones of spirit and desire are equally agreed that reason ought 
<A NAME="1041"></A>to rule, and do not rebel?
<A NAME="1042"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he said, that is the true account of temperance whether 
<A NAME="1043"></A>in the State or individual.
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR><BR>And surely, I said, we have explained again and again how and by 
<A NAME="1045"></A>virtue of what quality a man will be just.
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR><BR>That is very certain.
<A NAME="1047"></A><BR>And is justice dimmer in the individual, and is her form different, 
<A NAME="1048"></A>or is she the same which we found her to be in the State?
<A NAME="1049"></A><BR><BR>There is no difference in my opinion, he said.
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR>Because, if any doubt is still lingering in our minds, a few commonplace 
<A NAME="1051"></A>instances will satisfy us of the truth of what I am 
<A NAME="1052"></A>saying.
<A NAME="1053"></A><BR><BR>What sort of instances do you mean?
<A NAME="1054"></A><BR>If the case is put to us, must we not admit that the just State, or 
<A NAME="1055"></A>the man who is trained in the principles of such a State, will be less 
<A NAME="1056"></A>likely than the unjust to make away with a deposit of gold or silver? Would 
<A NAME="1057"></A>any one deny this?
<A NAME="1058"></A><BR><BR>No one, he replied.
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR>Will the just man or citizen ever be guilty of sacrilege or theft, 
<A NAME="1060"></A>or treachery either to his friends or to his country?
<A NAME="1061"></A><BR><BR>Never.
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR>Neither will he ever break faith where there have been oaths or 
<A NAME="1063"></A>agreements?
<A NAME="1064"></A><BR><BR>Impossible.
<A NAME="1065"></A><BR>No one will be less likely to commit adultery, or to dishonour his 
<A NAME="1066"></A>father and mother, or to fall in his religious duties?
<A NAME="1067"></A><BR><BR>No one.
<A NAME="1068"></A><BR>And the reason is that each part of him is doing its own business, 
<A NAME="1069"></A>whether in ruling or being ruled?
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR><BR>Exactly so.
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR>Are you satisfied then that the quality which makes such men and such 
<A NAME="1072"></A>states is justice, or do you hope to discover some other?
<A NAME="1073"></A><BR><BR>Not I, indeed.
<A NAME="1074"></A><BR>Then our dream has been realised; and the suspicion which we entertained 
<A NAME="1075"></A>at the beginning of our work of construction, that some divine power must 
<A NAME="1076"></A>have conducted us to a primary form of justice, has now been 
<A NAME="1077"></A>verified?
<A NAME="1078"></A><BR><BR>Yes, certainly.
<A NAME="1079"></A><BR>And the division of labour which required the carpenter and the shoemaker 
<A NAME="1080"></A>and the rest of the citizens to be doing each his own business, and not 
<A NAME="1081"></A>another's, was a shadow of justice, and for that reason it was of 
<A NAME="1082"></A>use?
<A NAME="1083"></A><BR><BR>Clearly.
<A NAME="1084"></A><BR>But in reality justice was such as we were describing, being concerned 
<A NAME="1085"></A>however, not with the outward man, but with the inward, which is the true 
<A NAME="1086"></A>self and concernment of man: for the just man does not permit the several 
<A NAME="1087"></A>elements within him to interfere with one another, or any of them to do 
<A NAME="1088"></A>the work of others, --he sets in order his own inner life, and is his own 
<A NAME="1089"></A>master and his own law, and at peace with himself; and when he has bound 
<A NAME="1090"></A>together the three principles within him, which may be compared to the 
<A NAME="1091"></A>higher, lower, and middle notes of the scale, and the intermediate intervals 
<A NAME="1092"></A>--when he has bound all these together, and is no longer many, but has 
<A NAME="1093"></A>become one entirely temperate and perfectly adjusted nature, then he proceeds 
<A NAME="1094"></A>to act, if he has to act, whether in a matter of property, or in the treatment 
<A NAME="1095"></A>of the body, or in some affair of politics or private business; always 
<A NAME="1096"></A>thinking and calling that which preserves and co-operates with this harmonious 
<A NAME="1097"></A>condition, just and good action, and the knowledge which presides over 
<A NAME="1098"></A>it, wisdom, and that which at any time impairs this condition, he will 
<A NAME="1099"></A>call unjust action, and the opinion which presides over it 
<A NAME="1100"></A>ignorance.
<A NAME="1101"></A><BR><BR>You have said the exact truth, Socrates.
<A NAME="1102"></A><BR>Very good; and if we were to affirm that we had discovered the just 
<A NAME="1103"></A>man and the just State, and the nature of justice in each of them, we should 
<A NAME="1104"></A>not be telling a falsehood?
<A NAME="1105"></A><BR><BR>Most certainly not.
<A NAME="1106"></A><BR>May we say so, then?
<A NAME="1107"></A><BR>Let us say so.
<A NAME="1108"></A><BR>And now, I said, injustice has to be considered.
<A NAME="1109"></A><BR>Clearly.
<A NAME="1110"></A><BR>Must not injustice be a strife which arises among the three principles 
<A NAME="1111"></A>--a meddlesomeness, and interference, and rising up of a part of the soul 
<A NAME="1112"></A>against the whole, an assertion of unlawful authority, which is made by 
<A NAME="1113"></A>a rebellious subject against a true prince, of whom he is the natural vassal, 
<A NAME="1114"></A>--what is all this confusion and delusion but injustice, and intemperance 
<A NAME="1115"></A>and cowardice and ignorance, and every form of vice?
<A NAME="1116"></A><BR><BR>Exactly so.
<A NAME="1117"></A><BR>And if the nature of justice and injustice be known, then the meaning 
<A NAME="1118"></A>of acting unjustly and being unjust, or, again, of acting justly, will 
<A NAME="1119"></A>also be perfectly clear?
<A NAME="1120"></A><BR><BR>What do you mean? he said.
<A NAME="1121"></A><BR>Why, I said, they are like disease and health; being in the soul just 
<A NAME="1122"></A>what disease and health are in the body.
<A NAME="1123"></A><BR><BR>How so? he said.
<A NAME="1124"></A><BR>Why, I said, that which is healthy causes health, and that which is 
<A NAME="1125"></A>unhealthy causes disease.
<A NAME="1126"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1127"></A><BR>And just actions cause justice, and unjust actions cause 
<A NAME="1128"></A>injustice?
<A NAME="1129"></A><BR>That is certain.
<A NAME="1130"></A><BR>And the creation of health is the institution of a natural order and 
<A NAME="1131"></A>government of one by another in the parts of the body; and the creation 
<A NAME="1132"></A>of disease is the production of a state of things at variance with this 
<A NAME="1133"></A>natural order?
<A NAME="1134"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="1135"></A><BR>And is not the creation of justice the institution of a natural order 
<A NAME="1136"></A>and government of one by another in the parts of the soul, and the creation 
<A NAME="1137"></A>of injustice the production of a state of things at variance with the natural 
<A NAME="1138"></A>order?
<A NAME="1139"></A><BR><BR>Exactly so, he said.
<A NAME="1140"></A><BR>Then virtue is the health and beauty and well-being of the soul, and 
<A NAME="1141"></A>vice the disease and weakness and deformity of the same?
<A NAME="1142"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="1143"></A><BR>And do not good practices lead to virtue, and evil practices to 
<A NAME="1144"></A>vice?
<A NAME="1145"></A><BR><BR>Assuredly.
<A NAME="1146"></A><BR>Still our old question of the comparative advantage of justice and 
<A NAME="1147"></A>injustice has not been answered: Which is the more profitable, to be just 
<A NAME="1148"></A>and act justly and practise virtue, whether seen or unseen of gods and 
<A NAME="1149"></A>men, or to be unjust and act unjustly, if only unpunished and 
<A NAME="1150"></A>unreformed?
<A NAME="1151"></A><BR><BR>In my judgment, Socrates, the question has now become ridiculous. 
<A NAME="1152"></A>We know that, when the bodily constitution is gone, life is no longer endurable, 
<A NAME="1153"></A>though pampered with all kinds of meats and drinks, and having all wealth 
<A NAME="1154"></A>and all power; and shall we be told that when the very essence of the vital 
<A NAME="1155"></A>principle is undermined and corrupted, life is still worth having to a 
<A NAME="1156"></A>man, if only he be allowed to do whatever he likes with the single exception 
<A NAME="1157"></A>that he is not to acquire justice and virtue, or to escape from injustice 
<A NAME="1158"></A>and vice; assuming them both to be such as we have described?
<A NAME="1159"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I said, the question is, as you say, ridiculous. Still, as 
<A NAME="1160"></A>we are near the spot at which we may see the truth in the clearest manner 
<A NAME="1161"></A>with our own eyes, let us not faint by the way.
<A NAME="1162"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not, he replied.
<A NAME="1163"></A><BR>Come up hither, I said, and behold the various forms of vice, those 
<A NAME="1164"></A>of them, I mean, which are worth looking at.
<A NAME="1165"></A><BR><BR>I am following you, he replied: proceed.
<A NAME="1166"></A><BR>I said, The argument seems to have reached a height from which, as 
<A NAME="1167"></A>from some tower of speculation, a man may look down and see that virtue 
<A NAME="1168"></A>is one, but that the forms of vice are innumerable; there being four special 
<A NAME="1169"></A>ones which are deserving of note.
<A NAME="1170"></A><BR><BR>What do you mean? he said.
<A NAME="1171"></A><BR>I mean, I replied, that there appear to be as many forms of the soul 
<A NAME="1172"></A>as there are distinct forms of the State.
<A NAME="1173"></A><BR><BR>How many?
<A NAME="1174"></A><BR>There are five of the State, and five of the soul, I 
<A NAME="1175"></A>said.
<A NAME="1176"></A><BR>What are they?
<A NAME="1177"></A><BR>The first, I said, is that which we have been describing, and which 
<A NAME="1178"></A>may be said to have two names, monarchy and aristocracy, accordingly as 
<A NAME="1179"></A>rule is exercised by one distinguished man or by many.
<A NAME="1180"></A><BR><BR>True, he replied.
<A NAME="1181"></A><BR>But I regard the two names as describing one form only; for whether 
<A NAME="1182"></A>the government is in the hands of one or many, if the governors have been 
<A NAME="1183"></A>trained in the manner which we have supposed, the fundamental laws of the 
<A NAME="1184"></A>State will be maintained.
<A NAME="1185"></A><BR><BR>That is true, he replied.
