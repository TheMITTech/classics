<A NAME="15"></A><BR><BR><B>Timaeus.</B> How thankful I am, Socrates, that I have arrived 
<A NAME="16"></A>at last, and, like a weary traveller after a long journey, may be at rest! 
<A NAME="17"></A>And I pray the being who always was of old, and has now been by me revealed, 
<A NAME="18"></A>to grant that my words may endure in so far as they have been spoken truly 
<A NAME="19"></A>and acceptably to him; but if unintentionally I have said anything wrong, 
<A NAME="20"></A>I pray that he will impose upon me a just retribution, and the just retribution 
<A NAME="21"></A>of him who errs is that he should be set right. Wishing, then, to speak 
<A NAME="22"></A>truly in future concerning the generation of the gods, I pray him to give 
<A NAME="23"></A>me knowledge, which of all medicines is the most perfect and best. And 
<A NAME="24"></A>now having offered my prayer I deliver up the argument to Critias, who 
<A NAME="25"></A>is to speak next according to our agreement.
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR><B>Critias.</B> And I, Timaeus, accept the trust, and as you at 
<A NAME="27"></A>first said that you were going to speak of high matters, and begged that 
<A NAME="28"></A>some forbearance might be shown to you, I too ask the same or greater forbearance 
<A NAME="29"></A>for what I am about to say. And although I very well know that my request 
<A NAME="30"></A>may appear to be somewhat and discourteous, I must make it nevertheless. 
<A NAME="31"></A>For will any man of sense deny that you have spoken well? I can only attempt 
<A NAME="32"></A>to show that I ought to have more indulgence than you, because my theme 
<A NAME="33"></A>is more difficult; and I shall argue that to seem to speak well of the 
<A NAME="34"></A>gods to men is far easier than to speak well of men to men: for the inexperience 
<A NAME="35"></A>and utter ignorance of his hearers about any subject is a great assistance 
<A NAME="36"></A>to him who has to speak of it, and we know how ignorant we are concerning 
<A NAME="37"></A>the gods. But I should like to make my meaning clearer, if Timaeus, you 
<A NAME="38"></A>will follow me. All that is said by any of us can only be imitation and 
<A NAME="39"></A>representation. For if we consider the likenesses which painters make of 
<A NAME="40"></A>bodies divine and heavenly, and the different degrees of gratification 
<A NAME="41"></A>with which the eye of the spectator receives them, we shall see that we 
<A NAME="42"></A>are satisfied with the artist who is able in any degree to imitate the 
<A NAME="43"></A>earth and its mountains, and the rivers, and the woods, and the universe, 
<A NAME="44"></A>and the things that are and move therein, and further, that knowing nothing 
<A NAME="45"></A>precise about such matters, we do not examine or analyze the painting; 
<A NAME="46"></A>all that is required is a sort of indistinct and deceptive mode of shadowing 
<A NAME="47"></A>them forth. But when a person endeavours to paint the human form we are 
<A NAME="48"></A>quick at finding out defects, and our familiar knowledge makes us severe 
<A NAME="49"></A>judges of any one who does not render every point of similarity. And we 
<A NAME="50"></A>may observe the same thing to happen in discourse; we are satisfied with 
<A NAME="51"></A>a picture of divine and heavenly things which has very little likeness 
<A NAME="52"></A>to them; but we are more precise in our criticism of mortal and human things. 
<A NAME="53"></A>Wherefore if at the moment of speaking I cannot suitably express my meaning, 
<A NAME="54"></A>you must excuse me, considering that to form approved likenesses of human 
<A NAME="55"></A>things is the reverse of easy. This is what I want to suggest to you, and 
<A NAME="56"></A>at the same time to beg, Socrates, that I may have not less, but more indulgence 
<A NAME="57"></A>conceded to me in what I am about to say. Which favour, if I am right in 
<A NAME="58"></A>asking, I hope that you will be ready to grant.
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR><B>Socrates.</B> Certainly, Critias, we will grant your request, 
<A NAME="60"></A>and we will grant the same by anticipation to Hermocrates, as well as to 
<A NAME="61"></A>you and Timaeus; for I have no doubt that when his turn comes a little 
<A NAME="62"></A>while hence, he will make the same request which you have made. In order, 
<A NAME="63"></A>then, that he may provide himself with a fresh beginning, and not be compelled 
<A NAME="64"></A>to say the same things over again, let him understand that the indulgence 
<A NAME="65"></A>is already extended by anticipation to him. And now, friend Critias, I 
<A NAME="66"></A>will announce to you the judgment of the theatre. They are of opinion that 
<A NAME="67"></A>the last performer was wonderfully successful, and that you will need a 
<A NAME="68"></A>great deal of indulgence before you will be able to take his 
<A NAME="69"></A>place.
<A NAME="70"></A><BR><BR><B>Hermocrates.</B> The warning, Socrates, which you have addressed 
<A NAME="71"></A>to him, I must also take to myself. But remember, Critias, that faint heart 
<A NAME="72"></A>never yet raised a trophy; and therefore you must go and attack the argument 
<A NAME="73"></A>like a man. First invoke Apollo and the Muses, and then let us hear you 
<A NAME="74"></A>sound the praises and show forth the virtues of your ancient 
<A NAME="75"></A>citizens.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR><B>Crit.</B> Friend Hermocrates, you, who are stationed last and 
<A NAME="77"></A>have another in front of you, have not lost heart as yet; the gravity of 
<A NAME="78"></A>the situation will soon be revealed to you; meanwhile I accept your exhortations 
<A NAME="79"></A>and encouragements. But besides the gods and goddesses whom you have mentioned, 
<A NAME="80"></A>I would specially invoke Mnemosyne; for all the important part of my discourse 
<A NAME="81"></A>is dependent on her favour, and if I can recollect and recite enough of 
<A NAME="82"></A>what was said by the priests and brought hither by Solon, I doubt not that 
<A NAME="83"></A>I shall satisfy the requirements of this theatre. And now, making no more 
<A NAME="84"></A>excuses, I will proceed.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>Let me begin by observing first of all, that nine thousand was 
<A NAME="86"></A>the sum of years which had elapsed since the war which was said to have 
<A NAME="87"></A>taken place between those who dwelt outside the Pillars of Heracles and 
<A NAME="88"></A>all who dwelt within them; this war I am going to describe. Of the combatants 
<A NAME="89"></A>on the one side, the city of Athens was reported to have been the leader 
<A NAME="90"></A>and to have fought out the war; the combatants on the other side were commanded 
<A NAME="91"></A>by the kings of Atlantis, which, as was saying, was an island greater in 
<A NAME="92"></A>extent than Libya and Asia, and when afterwards sunk by an earthquake, 
<A NAME="93"></A>became an impassable barrier of mud to voyagers sailing from hence to any 
<A NAME="94"></A>part of the ocean. The progress of the history will unfold the various 
<A NAME="95"></A>nations of barbarians and families of Hellenes which then existed, as they 
<A NAME="96"></A>successively appear on the scene; but I must describe first of all Athenians 
<A NAME="97"></A>of that day, and their enemies who fought with them, and then the respective 
<A NAME="98"></A>powers and governments of the two kingdoms. Let us give the precedence 
<A NAME="99"></A>to Athens.
<A NAME="100"></A><BR><BR>In the days of old the gods had the whole earth distributed among 
<A NAME="101"></A>them by allotment. There was no quarrelling; for you cannot rightly suppose 
<A NAME="102"></A>that the gods did not know what was proper for each of them to have, or, 
<A NAME="103"></A>knowing this, that they would seek to procure for themselves by contention 
<A NAME="104"></A>that which more properly belonged to others. They all of them by just apportionment 
<A NAME="105"></A>obtained what they wanted, and peopled their own districts; and when they 
<A NAME="106"></A>had peopled them they tended us, their nurselings and possessions, as shepherds 
<A NAME="107"></A>tend their flocks, excepting only that they did not use blows or bodily 
<A NAME="108"></A>force, as shepherds do, but governed us like pilots from the stern of the 
<A NAME="109"></A>vessel, which is an easy way of guiding animals, holding our souls by the 
<A NAME="110"></A>rudder of persuasion according to their own pleasure;-thus did they guide 
<A NAME="111"></A>all mortal creatures. Now different gods had their allotments in different 
<A NAME="112"></A>places which they set in order. Hephaestus and Athene, who were brother 
<A NAME="113"></A>and sister, and sprang from the same father, having a common nature, and 
<A NAME="114"></A>being united also in the love of philosophy and art, both obtained as their 
<A NAME="115"></A>common portion this land, which was naturally adapted for wisdom and virtue; 
<A NAME="116"></A>and there they implanted brave children of the soil, and put into their 
<A NAME="117"></A>minds the order of government; their names are preserved, but their actions 
<A NAME="118"></A>have disappeared by reason of the destruction of those who received the 
<A NAME="119"></A>tradition, and the lapse of ages. For when there were any survivors, as 
<A NAME="120"></A>I have already said, they were men who dwelt in the mountains; and they 
<A NAME="121"></A>were ignorant of the art of writing, and had heard only the names of the 
<A NAME="122"></A>chiefs of the land, but very little about their actions. The names they 
<A NAME="123"></A>were willing enough to give to their children; but the virtues and the 
<A NAME="124"></A>laws of their predecessors, they knew only by obscure traditions; and as 
<A NAME="125"></A>they themselves and their children lacked for many generations the necessaries 
<A NAME="126"></A>of life, they directed their attention to the supply of their wants, and 
<A NAME="127"></A>of them they conversed, to the neglect of events that had happened in times 
<A NAME="128"></A>long past; for mythology and the enquiry into antiquity are first introduced 
<A NAME="129"></A>into cities when they begin to have leisure, and when they see that the 
<A NAME="130"></A>necessaries of life have already been provided, but not before. And this 
<A NAME="131"></A>is reason why the names of the ancients have been preserved to us and not 
<A NAME="132"></A>their actions. This I infer because Solon said that the priests in their 
<A NAME="133"></A>narrative of that war mentioned most of the names which are recorded prior 
<A NAME="134"></A>to the time of Theseus, such as Cecrops, and Erechtheus, and Erichthonius, 
<A NAME="135"></A>and Erysichthon, and the names of the women in like manner. Moreover, since 
<A NAME="136"></A>military pursuits were then common to men and women, the men of those days 
<A NAME="137"></A>in accordance with the custom of the time set up a figure and image of 
<A NAME="138"></A>the goddess in full armour, to be a testimony that all animals which associate 
<A NAME="139"></A>together, male as well as female, may, if they please, practise in common 
<A NAME="140"></A>the virtue which belongs to them without distinction of 
<A NAME="141"></A>sex.
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR>Now the country was inhabited in those days by various classes 
<A NAME="143"></A>of citizens;-there were artisans, and there were husbandmen, and there 
<A NAME="144"></A>was also a warrior class originally set apart by divine men. The latter 
<A NAME="145"></A>dwelt by themselves, and had all things suitable for nurture and education; 
<A NAME="146"></A>neither had any of them anything of their own, but they regarded all that 
<A NAME="147"></A>they had as common property; nor did they claim to receive of the other 
<A NAME="148"></A>citizens anything more than their necessary food. And they practised all 
<A NAME="149"></A>the pursuits which we yesterday described as those of our imaginary guardians. 
<A NAME="150"></A>Concerning the country the Egyptian priests said what is not only probable 
<A NAME="151"></A>but manifestly true, that the boundaries were in those days fixed by the 
<A NAME="152"></A>Isthmus, and that in the direction of the continent they extended as far 
<A NAME="153"></A>as the heights of Cithaeron and Parnes; the boundary line came down in 
<A NAME="154"></A>the direction of the sea, having the district of Oropus on the right, and 
<A NAME="155"></A>with the river Asopus as the limit on the left. The land was the best in 
<A NAME="156"></A>the world, and was therefore able in those days to support a vast army, 
<A NAME="157"></A>raised from the surrounding people. Even the remnant of Attica which now 
<A NAME="158"></A>exists may compare with any region in the world for the variety and excellence 
<A NAME="159"></A>of its fruits and the suitableness of its pastures to every sort of animal, 
<A NAME="160"></A>which proves what I am saying; but in those days the country was fair as 
<A NAME="161"></A>now and yielded far more abundant produce. How shall I establish my words? 
<A NAME="162"></A>and what part of it can be truly called a remnant of the land that then 
<A NAME="163"></A>was? The whole country is only a long promontory extending far into the 
<A NAME="164"></A>sea away from the rest of the continent, while the surrounding basin of 
<A NAME="165"></A>the sea is everywhere deep in the neighbourhood of the shore. Many great 
<A NAME="166"></A>deluges have taken place during the nine thousand years, for that is the 
<A NAME="167"></A>number of years which have elapsed since the time of which I am speaking; 
<A NAME="168"></A>and during all this time and through so many changes, there has never been 
<A NAME="169"></A>any considerable accumulation of the soil coming down from the mountains, 
<A NAME="170"></A>as in other places, but the earth has fallen away all round and sunk out 
<A NAME="171"></A>of sight. The consequence is, that in comparison of what then was, there 
<A NAME="172"></A>are remaining only the bones of the wasted body, as they may be called, 
<A NAME="173"></A>as in the case of small islands, all the richer and softer parts of the 
<A NAME="174"></A>soil having fallen away, and the mere skeleton of the land being left. 
<A NAME="175"></A>But in the primitive state of the country, its mountains were high hills 
<A NAME="176"></A>covered with soil, and the plains, as they are termed by us, of Phelleus 
<A NAME="177"></A>were full of rich earth, and there was abundance of wood in the mountains. 
<A NAME="178"></A>Of this last the traces still remain, for although some of the mountains 
<A NAME="179"></A>now only afford sustenance to bees, not so very long ago there were still 
<A NAME="180"></A>to be seen roofs of timber cut from trees growing there, which were of 
<A NAME="181"></A>a size sufficient to cover the largest houses; and there were many other 
<A NAME="182"></A>high trees, cultivated by man and bearing abundance of food for cattle. 
<A NAME="183"></A>Moreover, the land reaped the benefit of the annual rainfall, not as now 
<A NAME="184"></A>losing the water which flows off the bare earth into the sea, but, having 
<A NAME="185"></A>an abundant supply in all places, and receiving it into herself and treasuring 
<A NAME="186"></A>it up in the close clay soil, it let off into the hollows the streams which 
<A NAME="187"></A>it absorbed from the heights, providing everywhere abundant fountains and 
<A NAME="188"></A>rivers, of which there may still be observed sacred memorials in places 
<A NAME="189"></A>where fountains once existed; and this proves the truth of what I am 
<A NAME="190"></A>saying.
<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR>Such was the natural state of the country, which was cultivated, 
<A NAME="192"></A>as we may well believe, by true husbandmen, who made husbandry their business, 
<A NAME="193"></A>and were lovers of honour, and of a noble nature, and had a soil the best 
<A NAME="194"></A>in the world, and abundance of water, and in the heaven above an excellently 
<A NAME="195"></A>attempered climate. Now the city in those days was arranged on this wise. 
<A NAME="196"></A>In the first place the Acropolis was not as now. For the fact is that a 
<A NAME="197"></A>single night of excessive rain washed away the earth and laid bare the 
<A NAME="198"></A>rock; at the same time there were earthquakes, and then occurred the extraordinary 
<A NAME="199"></A>inundation, which was the third before the great destruction of Deucalion. 
<A NAME="200"></A>But in primitive times the hill of the Acropolis extended to the Eridanus 
<A NAME="201"></A>and Ilissus, and included the Pnyx on one side, and the Lycabettus as a 
<A NAME="202"></A>boundary on the opposite side to the Pnyx, and was all well covered with 
<A NAME="203"></A>soil, and level at the top, except in one or two places. Outside the Acropolis 
<A NAME="204"></A>and under the sides of the hill there dwelt artisans, and such of the husbandmen 
<A NAME="205"></A>as were tilling the ground near; the warrior class dwelt by themselves 
<A NAME="206"></A>around the temples of Athene and Hephaestus at the summit, which moreover 
<A NAME="207"></A>they had enclosed with a single fence like the garden of a single house. 
<A NAME="208"></A>On the north side they had dwellings in common and had erected halls for 
<A NAME="209"></A>dining in winter, and had all the buildings which they needed for their 
<A NAME="210"></A>common life, besides temples, but there was no adorning of them with gold 
<A NAME="211"></A>and silver, for they made no use of these for any purpose; they took a 
<A NAME="212"></A>middle course between meanness and ostentation, and built modest houses 
<A NAME="213"></A>in which they and their children's children grew old, and they handed them 
<A NAME="214"></A>down to others who were like themselves, always the same. But in summer-time 
<A NAME="215"></A>they left their gardens and gymnasia and dining halls, and then the southern 
<A NAME="216"></A>side of the hill was made use of by them for the same purpose. Where the 
<A NAME="217"></A>Acropolis now is there was a fountain, which was choked by the earthquake, 
<A NAME="218"></A>and has left only the few small streams which still exist in the vicinity, 
<A NAME="219"></A>but in those days the fountain gave an abundant supply of water for all 
<A NAME="220"></A>and of suitable temperature in summer and in winter. This is how they dwelt, 
<A NAME="221"></A>being the guardians of their own citizens and the leaders of the Hellenes, 
<A NAME="222"></A>who were their willing followers. And they took care to preserve the same 
<A NAME="223"></A>number of men and women through all time, being so many as were required 
<A NAME="224"></A>for warlike purposes, then as now-that is to say, about twenty thousand. 
<A NAME="225"></A>Such were the ancient Athenians, and after this manner they righteously 
<A NAME="226"></A>administered their own land and the rest of Hellas; they were renowned 
<A NAME="227"></A>all over Europe and Asia for the beauty of their persons and for the many 
<A NAME="228"></A>virtues of their souls, and of all men who lived in those days they were 
<A NAME="229"></A>the most illustrious. And next, if I have not forgotten what I heard when 
<A NAME="230"></A>I was a child, I will impart to you the character and origin of their adversaries. 
<A NAME="231"></A>For friends should not keep their stories to themselves, but have them 
<A NAME="232"></A>in common.
<A NAME="233"></A><BR><BR>Yet, before proceeding further in the narrative, I ought to warn 
<A NAME="234"></A>you, that you must not be surprised if you should perhaps hear Hellenic 
<A NAME="235"></A>names given to foreigners. I will tell you the reason of this: Solon, who 
<A NAME="236"></A>was intending to use the tale for his poem, enquired into the meaning of 
<A NAME="237"></A>the names, and found that the early Egyptians in writing them down had 
<A NAME="238"></A>translated them into their own language, and he recovered the meaning of 
<A NAME="239"></A>the several names and when copying them out again translated them into 
<A NAME="240"></A>our language. My great-grandfather, Dropides, had the original writing, 
<A NAME="241"></A>which is still in my possession, and was carefully studied by me when I 
<A NAME="242"></A>was a child. Therefore if you hear names such as are used in this country, 
<A NAME="243"></A>you must not be surprised, for I have told how they came to be introduced. 
<A NAME="244"></A>The tale, which was of great length, began as follows:-
<A NAME="245"></A><BR><BR>I have before remarked in speaking of the allotments of the gods, 
<A NAME="246"></A>that they distributed the whole earth into portions differing in extent, 
<A NAME="247"></A>and made for themselves temples and instituted sacrifices. And Poseidon, 
<A NAME="248"></A>receiving for his lot the island of Atlantis, begat children by a mortal 
<A NAME="249"></A>woman, and settled them in a part of the island, which I will describe. 
<A NAME="250"></A>Looking towards the sea, but in the centre of the whole island, there was 
<A NAME="251"></A>a plain which is said to have been the fairest of all plains and very fertile. 
<A NAME="252"></A>Near the plain again, and also in the centre of the island at a distance 
<A NAME="253"></A>of about fifty stadia, there was a mountain not very high on any 
<A NAME="254"></A>side.
<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR>In this mountain there dwelt one of the earth born primeval men 
<A NAME="256"></A>of that country, whose name was Evenor, and he had a wife named Leucippe, 
<A NAME="257"></A>and they had an only daughter who was called Cleito. The maiden had already 
<A NAME="258"></A>reached womanhood, when her father and mother died; Poseidon fell in love 
<A NAME="259"></A>with her and had intercourse with her, and breaking the ground, inclosed 
<A NAME="260"></A>the hill in which she dwelt all round, making alternate zones of sea and 
<A NAME="261"></A>land larger and smaller, encircling one another; there were two of land 
<A NAME="262"></A>and three of water, which he turned as with a lathe, each having its circumference 
<A NAME="263"></A>equidistant every way from the centre, so that no man could get to the 
<A NAME="264"></A>island, for ships and voyages were not as yet. He himself, being a god, 
<A NAME="265"></A>found no difficulty in making special arrangements for the centre island, 
<A NAME="266"></A>bringing up two springs of water from beneath the earth, one of warm water 
<A NAME="267"></A>and the other of cold, and making every variety of food to spring up abundantly 
<A NAME="268"></A>from the soil. He also begat and brought up five pairs of twin male children; 
<A NAME="269"></A>and dividing the island of Atlantis into ten portions, he gave to the first-born 
<A NAME="270"></A>of the eldest pair his mother's dwelling and the surrounding allotment, 
<A NAME="271"></A>which was the largest and best, and made him king over the rest; the others 
<A NAME="272"></A>he made princes, and gave them rule over many men, and a large territory. 
<A NAME="273"></A>And he named them all; the eldest, who was the first king, he named Atlas, 
<A NAME="274"></A>and after him the whole island and the ocean were called Atlantic. To his 
<A NAME="275"></A>twin brother, who was born after him, and obtained as his lot the extremity 
<A NAME="276"></A>of the island towards the Pillars of Heracles, facing the country which 
<A NAME="277"></A>is now called the region of Gades in that part of the world, he gave the 
<A NAME="278"></A>name which in the Hellenic language is Eumelus, in the language of the 
<A NAME="279"></A>country which is named after him, Gadeirus. Of the second pair of twins 
<A NAME="280"></A>he called one Ampheres, and the other Evaemon. To the elder of the third 
<A NAME="281"></A>pair of twins he gave the name Mneseus, and Autochthon to the one who followed 
<A NAME="282"></A>him. Of the fourth pair of twins he called the elder Elasippus, and the 
<A NAME="283"></A>younger Mestor. And of the fifth pair he gave to the elder the name of 
<A NAME="284"></A>Azaes, and to the younger that of Diaprepes. All these and their descendants 
<A NAME="285"></A>for many generations were the inhabitants and rulers of divers islands 
<A NAME="286"></A>in the open sea; and also, as has been already said, they held sway in 
<A NAME="287"></A>our direction over the country within the Pillars as far as Egypt and 
<A NAME="288"></A>Tyrrhenia.
<A NAME="289"></A><BR><BR>Now Atlas had a numerous and honourable family, and they retained 
<A NAME="290"></A>the kingdom, the eldest son handing it on to his eldest for many generations; 
<A NAME="291"></A>and they had such an amount of wealth as was never before possessed by 
<A NAME="292"></A>kings and potentates, and is not likely ever to be again, and they were 
<A NAME="293"></A>furnished with everything which they needed, both in the city and country. 
<A NAME="294"></A>For because of the greatness of their empire many things were brought to 
<A NAME="295"></A>them from foreign countries, and the island itself provided most of what 
<A NAME="296"></A>was required by them for the uses of life. In the first place, they dug 
<A NAME="297"></A>out of the earth whatever was to be found there, solid as well as fusile, 
<A NAME="298"></A>and that which is now only a name and was then something more than a name, 
<A NAME="299"></A>orichalcum, was dug out of the earth in many parts of the island, being 
<A NAME="300"></A>more precious in those days than anything except gold. There was an abundance 
<A NAME="301"></A>of wood for carpenter's work, and sufficient maintenance for tame and wild 
<A NAME="302"></A>animals. Moreover, there were a great number of elephants in the island; 
<A NAME="303"></A>for as there was provision for all other sorts of animals, both for those 
<A NAME="304"></A>which live in lakes and marshes and rivers, and also for those which live 
<A NAME="305"></A>in mountains and on plains, so there was for the animal which is the largest 
<A NAME="306"></A>and most voracious of all. Also whatever fragrant things there now are 
<A NAME="307"></A>in the earth, whether roots, or herbage, or woods, or essences which distil 
<A NAME="308"></A>from fruit and flower, grew and thrived in that land; also the fruit which 
<A NAME="309"></A>admits of cultivation, both the dry sort, which is given us for nourishment 
<A NAME="310"></A>and any other which we use for food-we call them all by the common name 
<A NAME="311"></A>pulse, and the fruits having a hard rind, affording drinks and meats and 
<A NAME="312"></A>ointments, and good store of chestnuts and the like, which furnish pleasure 
<A NAME="313"></A>and amusement, and are fruits which spoil with keeping, and the pleasant 
<A NAME="314"></A>kinds of dessert, with which we console ourselves after dinner, when we 
<A NAME="315"></A>are tired of eating-all these that sacred island which then beheld the 
<A NAME="316"></A>light of the sun, brought forth fair and wondrous and in infinite abundance. 
<A NAME="317"></A>With such blessings the earth freely furnished them; meanwhile they went 
<A NAME="318"></A>on constructing their temples and palaces and harbours and docks. And they 
<A NAME="319"></A>arranged the whole country in the following manner:
<A NAME="320"></A><BR><BR>First of all they bridged over the zones of sea which surrounded 
<A NAME="321"></A>the ancient metropolis, making a road to and from the royal palace. And 
<A NAME="322"></A>at the very beginning they built the palace in the habitation of the god 
<A NAME="323"></A>and of their ancestors, which they continued to ornament in successive 
<A NAME="324"></A>generations, every king surpassing the one who went before him to the utmost 
<A NAME="325"></A>of his power, until they made the building a marvel to behold for size 
<A NAME="326"></A>and for beauty. And beginning from the sea they bored a canal of three 
<A NAME="327"></A>hundred feet in width and one hundred feet in depth and fifty stadia in 
<A NAME="328"></A>length, which they carried through to the outermost zone, making a passage 
<A NAME="329"></A>from the sea up to this, which became a harbour, and leaving an opening 
<A NAME="330"></A>sufficient to enable the largest vessels to find ingress. Moreover, they 
<A NAME="331"></A>divided at the bridges the zones of land which parted the zones of sea, 
<A NAME="332"></A>leaving room for a single trireme to pass out of one zone into another, 
<A NAME="333"></A>and they covered over the channels so as to leave a way underneath for 
<A NAME="334"></A>the ships; for the banks were raised considerably above the water. Now 
<A NAME="335"></A>the largest of the zones into which a passage was cut from the sea was 
<A NAME="336"></A>three stadia in breadth, and the zone of land which came next of equal 
<A NAME="337"></A>breadth; but the next two zones, the one of water, the other of land, were 
<A NAME="338"></A>two stadia, and the one which surrounded the central island was a stadium 
<A NAME="339"></A>only in width. The island in which the palace was situated had a diameter 
<A NAME="340"></A>of five stadia. All this including the zones and the bridge, which was 
<A NAME="341"></A>the sixth part of a stadium in width, they surrounded by a stone wall on 
<A NAME="342"></A>every side, placing towers and gates on the bridges where the sea passed 
<A NAME="343"></A>in. The stone which was used in the work they quarried from underneath 
<A NAME="344"></A>the centre island, and from underneath the zones, on the outer as well 
<A NAME="345"></A>as the inner side. One kind was white, another black, and a third red, 
<A NAME="346"></A>and as they quarried, they at the same time hollowed out double docks, 
<A NAME="347"></A>having roofs formed out of the native rock. Some of their buildings were 
<A NAME="348"></A>simple, but in others they put together different stones, varying the colour 
<A NAME="349"></A>to please the eye, and to be a natural source of delight. The entire circuit 
<A NAME="350"></A>of the wall, which went round the outermost zone, they covered with a coating 
<A NAME="351"></A>of brass, and the circuit of the next wall they coated with tin, and the 
<A NAME="352"></A>third, which encompassed the citadel, flashed with the red light of 
<A NAME="353"></A>orichalcum.
<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR>The palaces in the interior of the citadel were constructed on 
<A NAME="355"></A>this wise:-in the centre was a holy temple dedicated to Cleito and Poseidon, 
<A NAME="356"></A>which remained inaccessible, and was surrounded by an enclosure of gold; 
<A NAME="357"></A>this was the spot where the family of the ten princes first saw the light, 
<A NAME="358"></A>and thither the people annually brought the fruits of the earth in their 
<A NAME="359"></A>season from all the ten portions, to be an offering to each of the ten. 
<A NAME="360"></A>Here was Poseidon's own temple which was a stadium in length, and half 
<A NAME="361"></A>a stadium in width, and of a proportionate height, having a strange barbaric 
<A NAME="362"></A>appearance. All the outside of the temple, with the exception of the pinnacles, 
<A NAME="363"></A>they covered with silver, and the pinnacles with gold. In the interior 
<A NAME="364"></A>of the temple the roof was of ivory, curiously wrought everywhere with 
<A NAME="365"></A>gold and silver and orichalcum; and all the other parts, the walls and 
<A NAME="366"></A>pillars and floor, they coated with orichalcum. In the temple they placed 
<A NAME="367"></A>statues of gold: there was the god himself standing in a chariot-the charioteer 
<A NAME="368"></A>of six winged horses-and of such a size that he touched the roof of the 
<A NAME="369"></A>building with his head; around him there were a hundred Nereids riding 
<A NAME="370"></A>on dolphins, for such was thought to be the number of them by the men of 
<A NAME="371"></A>those days. There were also in the interior of the temple other images 
<A NAME="372"></A>which had been dedicated by private persons. And around the temple on the 
<A NAME="373"></A>outside were placed statues of gold of all the descendants of the ten kings 
<A NAME="374"></A>and of their wives, and there were many other great offerings of kings 
<A NAME="375"></A>and of private persons, coming both from the city itself and from the foreign 
<A NAME="376"></A>cities over which they held sway. There was an altar too, which in size 
<A NAME="377"></A>and workmanship corresponded to this magnificence, and the palaces, in 
<A NAME="378"></A>like manner, answered to the greatness of the kingdom and the glory of 
<A NAME="379"></A>the temple.
<A NAME="380"></A><BR><BR>In the next place, they had fountains, one of cold and another 
<A NAME="381"></A>of hot water, in gracious plenty flowing; and they were wonderfully adapted 
<A NAME="382"></A>for use by reason of the pleasantness and excellence of their waters. They 
<A NAME="383"></A>constructed buildings about them and planted suitable trees, also they 
<A NAME="384"></A>made cisterns, some open to the heavens, others roofed over, to be used 
<A NAME="385"></A>in winter as warm baths; there were the kings' baths, and the baths of 
<A NAME="386"></A>private persons, which were kept apart; and there were separate baths for 
<A NAME="387"></A>women, and for horses and cattle, and to each of them they gave as much 
<A NAME="388"></A>adornment as was suitable. Of the water which ran off they carried some 
<A NAME="389"></A>to the grove of Poseidon, where were growing all manner of trees of wonderful 
<A NAME="390"></A>height and beauty, owing to the excellence of the soil, while the remainder 
<A NAME="391"></A>was conveyed by aqueducts along the bridges to the outer circles; and there 
<A NAME="392"></A>were many temples built and dedicated to many gods; also gardens and places 
<A NAME="393"></A>of exercise, some for men, and others for horses in both of the two islands 
<A NAME="394"></A>formed by the zones; and in the centre of the larger of the two there was 
<A NAME="395"></A>set apart a race-course of a stadium in width, and in length allowed to 
<A NAME="396"></A>extend all round the island, for horses to race in. Also there were guardhouses 
<A NAME="397"></A>at intervals for the guards, the more trusted of whom were appointed-to 
<A NAME="398"></A>keep watch in the lesser zone, which was nearer the Acropolis while the 
<A NAME="399"></A>most trusted of all had houses given them within the citadel, near the 
<A NAME="400"></A>persons of the kings. The docks were full of triremes and naval stores, 
<A NAME="401"></A>and all things were quite ready for use. Enough of the plan of the royal 
<A NAME="402"></A>palace.
<A NAME="403"></A><BR><BR>Leaving the palace and passing out across the three you came to 
<A NAME="404"></A>a wall which began at the sea and went all round: this was everywhere distant 
<A NAME="405"></A>fifty stadia from the largest zone or harbour, and enclosed the whole, 
<A NAME="406"></A>the ends meeting at the mouth of the channel which led to the sea. The 
<A NAME="407"></A>entire area was densely crowded with habitations; and the canal and the 
<A NAME="408"></A>largest of the harbours were full of vessels and merchants coming from 
<A NAME="409"></A>all parts, who, from their numbers, kept up a multitudinous sound of human 
<A NAME="410"></A>voices, and din and clatter of all sorts night and day.
<A NAME="411"></A><BR><BR>I have described the city and the environs of the ancient palace 
<A NAME="412"></A>nearly in the words of Solon, and now I must endeavour to represent the 
<A NAME="413"></A>nature and arrangement of the rest of the land. The whole country was said 
<A NAME="414"></A>by him to be very lofty and precipitous on the side of the sea, but the 
<A NAME="415"></A>country immediately about and surrounding the city was a level plain, itself 
<A NAME="416"></A>surrounded by mountains which descended towards the sea; it was smooth 
<A NAME="417"></A>and even, and of an oblong shape, extending in one direction three thousand 
<A NAME="418"></A>stadia, but across the centre inland it was two thousand stadia. This part 
<A NAME="419"></A>of the island looked towards the south, and was sheltered from the north. 
<A NAME="420"></A>The surrounding mountains were celebrated for their number and size and 
<A NAME="421"></A>beauty, far beyond any which still exist, having in them also many wealthy 
<A NAME="422"></A>villages of country folk, and rivers, and lakes, and meadows supplying 
<A NAME="423"></A>food enough for every animal, wild or tame, and much wood of various sorts, 
<A NAME="424"></A>abundant for each and every kind of work.
<A NAME="425"></A><BR><BR>I will now describe the plain, as it was fashioned by nature and 
<A NAME="426"></A>by the labours of many generations of kings through long ages. It was for 
<A NAME="427"></A>the most part rectangular and oblong, and where falling out of the straight 
<A NAME="428"></A>line followed the circular ditch. The depth, and width, and length of this 
<A NAME="429"></A>ditch were incredible, and gave the impression that a work of such extent, 
<A NAME="430"></A>in addition to so many others, could never have been artificial. Nevertheless 
<A NAME="431"></A>I must say what I was told. It was excavated to the depth of a hundred, 
<A NAME="432"></A>feet, and its breadth was a stadium everywhere; it was carried round the 
<A NAME="433"></A>whole of the plain, and was ten thousand stadia in length. It received 
<A NAME="434"></A>the streams which came down from the mountains, and winding round the plain 
<A NAME="435"></A>and meeting at the city, was there let off into the sea. Further inland, 
<A NAME="436"></A>likewise, straight canals of a hundred feet in width were cut from it through 
<A NAME="437"></A>the plain, and again let off into the ditch leading to the sea: these canals 
<A NAME="438"></A>were at intervals of a hundred stadia, and by them they brought down the 
<A NAME="439"></A>wood from the mountains to the city, and conveyed the fruits of the earth 
<A NAME="440"></A>in ships, cutting transverse passages from one canal into another, and 
<A NAME="441"></A>to the city. Twice in the year they gathered the fruits of the earth-in 
<A NAME="442"></A>winter having the benefit of the rains of heaven, and in summer the water 
<A NAME="443"></A>which the land supplied by introducing streams from the 
<A NAME="444"></A>canals.
<A NAME="445"></A><BR><BR>As to the population, each of the lots in the plain had to find 
<A NAME="446"></A>a leader for the men who were fit for military service, and the size of 
<A NAME="447"></A>a lot was a square of ten stadia each way, and the total number of all 
<A NAME="448"></A>the lots was sixty thousand. And of the inhabitants of the mountains and 
<A NAME="449"></A>of the rest of the country there was also a vast multitude, which was distributed 
<A NAME="450"></A>among the lots and had leaders assigned to them according to their districts 
<A NAME="451"></A>and villages. The leader was required to furnish for the war the sixth 
<A NAME="452"></A>portion of a war-chariot, so as to make up a total of ten thousand chariots; 
<A NAME="453"></A>also two horses and riders for them, and a pair of chariot-horses without 
<A NAME="454"></A>a seat, accompanied by a horseman who could fight on foot carrying a small 
<A NAME="455"></A>shield, and having a charioteer who stood behind the man-at-arms to guide 
<A NAME="456"></A>the two horses; also, he was bound to furnish two heavy armed soldiers, 
<A NAME="457"></A>two slingers, three stone-shooters and three javelin-men, who were light-armed, 
<A NAME="458"></A>and four sailors to make up the complement of twelve hundred ships. Such 
<A NAME="459"></A>was the military order of the royal city-the order of the other nine governments 
<A NAME="460"></A>varied, and it would be wearisome to recount their several 
<A NAME="461"></A>differences.
<A NAME="462"></A><BR><BR>As to offices and honours, the following was the arrangement from 
<A NAME="463"></A>the first. Each of the ten kings in his own division and in his own city 
<A NAME="464"></A>had the absolute control of the citizens, and, in most cases, of the laws, 
<A NAME="465"></A>punishing and slaying whomsoever he would. Now the order of precedence 
<A NAME="466"></A>among them and their mutual relations were regulated by the commands of 
<A NAME="467"></A>Poseidon which the law had handed down. These were inscribed by the first 
<A NAME="468"></A>kings on a pillar of orichalcum, which was situated in the middle of the 
<A NAME="469"></A>island, at the temple of Poseidon, whither the kings were gathered together 
<A NAME="470"></A>every fifth and every sixth year alternately, thus giving equal honour 
<A NAME="471"></A>to the odd and to the even number. And when they were gathered together 
<A NAME="472"></A>they consulted about their common interests, and enquired if any one had 
<A NAME="473"></A>transgressed in anything and passed judgment and before they passed judgment 
<A NAME="474"></A>they gave their pledges to one another on this wise:-There were bulls who 
<A NAME="475"></A>had the range of the temple of Poseidon; and the ten kings, being left 
<A NAME="476"></A>alone in the temple, after they had offered prayers to the god that they 
<A NAME="477"></A>might capture the victim which was acceptable to him, hunted the bulls, 
<A NAME="478"></A>without weapons but with staves and nooses; and the bull which they caught 
<A NAME="479"></A>they led up to the pillar and cut its throat over the top of it so that 
<A NAME="480"></A>the blood fell upon the sacred inscription. Now on the pillar, besides 
<A NAME="481"></A>the laws, there was inscribed an oath invoking mighty curses on the disobedient. 
<A NAME="482"></A>When therefore, after slaying the bull in the accustomed manner, they had 
<A NAME="483"></A>burnt its limbs, they filled a bowl of wine and cast in a clot of blood 
<A NAME="484"></A>for each of them; the rest of the victim they put in the fire, after having 
<A NAME="485"></A>purified the column all round. Then they drew from the bowl in golden cups 
<A NAME="486"></A>and pouring a libation on the fire, they swore that they would judge according 
<A NAME="487"></A>to the laws on the pillar, and would punish him who in any point had already 
<A NAME="488"></A>transgressed them, and that for the future they would not, if they could 
<A NAME="489"></A>help, offend against the writing on the pillar, and would neither command 
<A NAME="490"></A>others, nor obey any ruler who commanded them, to act otherwise than according 
<A NAME="491"></A>to the laws of their father Poseidon. This was the prayer which each of 
<A NAME="492"></A>them-offered up for himself and for his descendants, at the same time drinking 
<A NAME="493"></A>and dedicating the cup out of which he drank in the temple of the god; 
<A NAME="494"></A>and after they had supped and satisfied their needs, when darkness came 
<A NAME="495"></A>on, and the fire about the sacrifice was cool, all of them put on most 
<A NAME="496"></A>beautiful azure robes, and, sitting on the ground, at night, over the embers 
<A NAME="497"></A>of the sacrifices by which they had sworn, and extinguishing all the fire 
<A NAME="498"></A>about the temple, they received and gave judgment, if any of them had an 
<A NAME="499"></A>accusation to bring against any one; and when they given judgment, at daybreak 
<A NAME="500"></A>they wrote down their sentences on a golden tablet, and dedicated it together 
<A NAME="501"></A>with their robes to be a memorial.
<A NAME="502"></A><BR><BR>There were many special laws affecting the several kings inscribed 
<A NAME="503"></A>about the temples, but the most important was the following: They were 
<A NAME="504"></A>not to take up arms against one another, and they were all to come to the 
<A NAME="505"></A>rescue if any one in any of their cities attempted to overthrow the royal 
<A NAME="506"></A>house; like their ancestors, they were to deliberate in common about war 
<A NAME="507"></A>and other matters, giving the supremacy to the descendants of Atlas. And 
<A NAME="508"></A>the king was not to have the power of life and death over any of his kinsmen 
<A NAME="509"></A>unless he had the assent of the majority of the ten.
<A NAME="510"></A><BR><BR>Such was the vast power which the god settled in the lost island 
<A NAME="511"></A>of Atlantis; and this he afterwards directed against our land for the following 
<A NAME="512"></A>reasons, as tradition tells: For many generations, as long as the divine 
<A NAME="513"></A>nature lasted in them, they were obedient to the laws, and well-affectioned 
<A NAME="514"></A>towards the god, whose seed they were; for they possessed true and in every 
<A NAME="515"></A>way great spirits, uniting gentleness with wisdom in the various chances 
<A NAME="516"></A>of life, and in their intercourse with one another. They despised everything 
<A NAME="517"></A>but virtue, caring little for their present state of life, and thinking 
<A NAME="518"></A>lightly of the possession of gold and other property, which seemed only 
<A NAME="519"></A>a burden to them; neither were they intoxicated by luxury; nor did wealth 
<A NAME="520"></A>deprive them of their self-control; but they were sober, and saw clearly 
<A NAME="521"></A>that all these goods are increased by virtue and friendship with one another, 
<A NAME="522"></A>whereas by too great regard and respect for them, they are lost and friendship 
<A NAME="523"></A>with them. By such reflections and by the continuance in them of a divine 
<A NAME="524"></A>nature, the qualities which we have described grew and increased among 
<A NAME="525"></A>them; but when the divine portion began to fade away, and became diluted 
<A NAME="526"></A>too often and too much with the mortal admixture, and the human nature 
<A NAME="527"></A>got the upper hand, they then, being unable to bear their fortune, behaved 
<A NAME="528"></A>unseemly, and to him who had an eye to see grew visibly debased, for they 
<A NAME="529"></A>were losing the fairest of their precious gifts; but to those who had no 
<A NAME="530"></A>eye to see the true happiness, they appeared glorious and blessed at the 
<A NAME="531"></A>very time when they were full of avarice and unrighteous power. Zeus, the 
<A NAME="532"></A>god of gods, who rules according to law, and is able to see into such things, 
<A NAME="533"></A>perceiving that an honourable race was in a woeful plight, and wanting 
<A NAME="534"></A>to inflict punishment on them, that they might be chastened and improve, 
<A NAME="535"></A>collected all the gods into their most holy habitation, which, being placed 
<A NAME="536"></A>in the centre of the world, beholds all created things. And when he had 
<A NAME="537"></A>called them together, he spake as follows-* <B>  The rest of the Dialogue 
<A NAME="538"></A>of Critias has been lost.</B>
