<A NAME="19"></A><BR><BR><B>Com.</B> Where do you come from, Socrates? And yet I need hardly 
<A NAME="20"></A>ask the question, for I know that you have been in chase of the fair Alcibiades. 
<A NAME="21"></A>I saw the day before yesterday; and he had got a beard like a man-and he 
<A NAME="22"></A>is a man, as I may tell you in your ear. But I thought that he was still 
<A NAME="23"></A>very charming.
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> What of his beard? Are you not of Homer's opinion, 
<A NAME="25"></A>who says
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR>Youth is most charming when the beard first appears? And that is 
<A NAME="27"></A>now the charm of Alcibiades.
<A NAME="28"></A><BR><BR><B>Com.</B> Well, and how do matters proceed? Have you been visiting 
<A NAME="29"></A>him, and was he gracious to you?
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yes, I thought that he was very gracious; and especially 
<A NAME="31"></A>to-day, for I have just come from him, and he has been helping me in an 
<A NAME="32"></A>argument. But shall I tell you a strange thing? I paid no attention to 
<A NAME="33"></A>him, and several times I quite forgot that he was present.
<A NAME="34"></A><BR><BR><B>Com.</B> What is the meaning of this? Has anything happened 
<A NAME="35"></A>between you and him? For surely you cannot have discovered a fairer love 
<A NAME="36"></A>than he is; certainly not in this city of Athens.
<A NAME="37"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yes, much fairer.
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR><B>Com.</B> What do you mean-a citizen or a 
<A NAME="39"></A>foreigner?
<A NAME="40"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> A foreigner.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR><BR><B>Com.</B> Of what country?
<A NAME="42"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Of Abdera.
<A NAME="43"></A><BR><BR><B>Com.</B> And is this stranger really in your opinion a fairer 
<A NAME="44"></A>love than the son of Cleinias?
<A NAME="45"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And is not the wiser always the fairer, sweet 
<A NAME="46"></A>friend?
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR><B>Com.</B> But have you really met, Socrates, with some wise 
<A NAME="48"></A>one?
<A NAME="49"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Say rather, with the wisest of all living men, if you 
<A NAME="50"></A>are willing to accord that title to Protagoras.
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR><B>Com.</B> What! Is Protagoras in Athens?
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yes; he has been here two days.
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR><B>Com.</B> And do you just come from an interview with 
<A NAME="54"></A>him?
<A NAME="55"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yes; and I have heard and said many 
<A NAME="56"></A>things.
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR><B>Com.</B> Then, if you have no engagement, suppose that you sit 
<A NAME="58"></A>down tell me what passed, and my attendant here shall give up his place 
<A NAME="59"></A>to you.
<A NAME="60"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> To be sure; and I shall be grateful to you for 
<A NAME="61"></A>listening.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR><B>Com.</B> Thank you, too, for telling us.
<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> That is thank you twice over. Listen 
<A NAME="64"></A>then:-
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>Last night, or rather very early this morning, Hippocrates, the son 
<A NAME="66"></A>of Apollodorus and the brother of Phason, gave a tremendous thump with 
<A NAME="67"></A>his staff at my door; some one opened to him, and he came rushing in and 
<A NAME="68"></A>bawled out: Socrates, are you awake or asleep?
<A NAME="69"></A><BR><BR>I knew his voice, and said: Hippocrates, is that you? and do you 
<A NAME="70"></A>bring any news?
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>Good news, he said; nothing but good.
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>Delightful, I said; but what is the news? and why have you come hither 
<A NAME="73"></A>at this unearthly hour?
<A NAME="74"></A><BR><BR>He drew nearer to me and said: Protagoras is 
<A NAME="75"></A>come.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>Yes, I replied; he came two days ago: have you only just heard of his 
<A NAME="77"></A>arrival?
<A NAME="78"></A><BR><BR>Yes, by the gods, he said; but not until yesterday 
<A NAME="79"></A>evening.
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>At the same time he felt for the truckle-bed, and sat down at my feet, 
<A NAME="81"></A>and then he said: Yesterday quite late in the evening, on my return from 
<A NAME="82"></A>Oenoe whither I had gone in pursuit of my runaway slave Satyrus, as I meant 
<A NAME="83"></A>to have told you, if some other matter had not come in the way;-on my return, 
<A NAME="84"></A>when we had done supper and were about to retire to rest, my brother said 
<A NAME="85"></A>to me: Protagoras is come. I was going to you at once, and then I thought 
<A NAME="86"></A>that the night was far spent. But the moment sleep left me after my fatigue, 
<A NAME="87"></A>I got up and came hither direct.
<A NAME="88"></A><BR><BR>I, who knew the very courageous madness of the man, said: What 
<A NAME="89"></A>is the matter? Has Protagoras robbed you of anything?
<A NAME="90"></A><BR><BR>He replied, laughing: Yes, indeed he has, Socrates, of the wisdom 
<A NAME="91"></A>which he keeps from me.
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR>But, surely, I said, if you give him money, and make friends with 
<A NAME="93"></A>him, he will make you as wise as he is himself.
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR>Would to heaven, he replied, that this were the case! He might 
<A NAME="95"></A>take all that I have, and all that my friends have, if he pleased. But 
<A NAME="96"></A>that is why I have come to you now, in order that you may speak to him 
<A NAME="97"></A>on my behalf; for I am young, and also I have never seen nor heard him; 
<A NAME="98"></A>(when he visited Athens before I was but a child) and all men praise him, 
<A NAME="99"></A>Socrates; he is reputed to be the most accomplished of speakers. There 
<A NAME="100"></A>is no reason why we should not go to him at once, and then we shall find 
<A NAME="101"></A>him at home. He lodges, as I hear, with Callias the son of Hipponicus: 
<A NAME="102"></A>let us start.
<A NAME="103"></A><BR><BR>I replied: Not yet, my good friend; the hour is too early. But 
<A NAME="104"></A>let us rise and take a turn in the court and wait about there until daybreak; 
<A NAME="105"></A>when the day breaks, then we will go. For Protagoras is generally at home, 
<A NAME="106"></A>and we shall be sure to find him; never fear.
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR>Upon this we got up and walked about in the court, and I thought 
<A NAME="108"></A>that I would make trial of the strength of his resolution. So I examined 
<A NAME="109"></A>him and put questions to him. Tell me, Hippocrates, I said, as you are 
<A NAME="110"></A>going to Protagoras, and will be paying your money to him, what is he to 
<A NAME="111"></A>whom you are going? and what will he make of you? If, for example, you 
<A NAME="112"></A>had thought of going to Hippocrates of Cos, the Asclepiad, and were about 
<A NAME="113"></A>to give him your money, and some one had said to you: You are paying money 
<A NAME="114"></A>to your namesake Hippocrates, O Hippocrates; tell me, what is he that you 
<A NAME="115"></A>give him money? how would you have answered?
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR>I should say, he replied, that I gave money to him as a 
<A NAME="117"></A>physician.
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>And what will he make of you?
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>A physician, he said.
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>And if you were resolved to go to Polycleitus the Argive, or Pheidias 
<A NAME="121"></A>the Athenian, and were intending to give them money, and some one had asked 
<A NAME="122"></A>you: What are Polycleitus and Pheidias? and why do you give them this money?-how 
<A NAME="123"></A>would you have answered?
<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR>I should have answered, that they were statuaries.
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>And what will they make of you?
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>A statuary, of course.
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>Well now, I said, you and I are going to Protagoras, and we are ready 
<A NAME="128"></A>to pay him money on your behalf. If our own means are sufficient, and we 
<A NAME="129"></A>can gain him with these, we shall be only too glad; but if not, then we 
<A NAME="130"></A>are to spend the money of your friends as well. Now suppose, that while 
<A NAME="131"></A>we are thus enthusiastically pursuing our object some one were to say to 
<A NAME="132"></A>us: Tell me, Socrates, and you Hippocrates, what is Protagoras, and why 
<A NAME="133"></A>are you going to pay him money,-how should we answer? I know that Pheidias 
<A NAME="134"></A>is a sculptor, and that Homer is a poet; but what appellation is given 
<A NAME="135"></A>to Protagoras? how is he designated?
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>They call him a Sophist, Socrates, he replied.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>Then we are going to pay our money to him in the character of a 
<A NAME="138"></A>Sophist?
<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>But suppose a person were to ask this further question: And how about 
<A NAME="141"></A>yourself? What will Protagoras make of you, if you go to see 
<A NAME="142"></A>him?
<A NAME="143"></A><BR><BR>He answered, with a blush upon his face (for the day was just beginning 
<A NAME="144"></A>to dawn, so that I could see him): Unless this differs in some way from 
<A NAME="145"></A>the former instances, I suppose that he will make a Sophist of 
<A NAME="146"></A>me.
<A NAME="147"></A><BR><BR>By the gods, I said, and are you not ashamed at having to appear 
<A NAME="148"></A>before the Hellenes in the character of a Sophist?
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR>Indeed, Socrates, to confess the truth, I am.
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>But you should not assume, Hippocrates, that the instruction of Protagoras 
<A NAME="151"></A>is of this nature: may you not learn of him in the same way that you learned 
<A NAME="152"></A>the arts of the grammarian, musician, or trainer, not with the view of 
<A NAME="153"></A>making any of them a profession, but only as a part of education, and because 
<A NAME="154"></A>a private gentleman and freeman ought to know them?
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR>Just so, he said; and that, in my opinion, is a far truer account 
<A NAME="156"></A>of the teaching of Protagoras.
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR>I said: I wonder whether you know what you are 
<A NAME="158"></A>doing?
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>And what am I doing?
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>You are going to commit your soul to the care of a man whom you call 
<A NAME="161"></A>a Sophist. And yet I hardly think that you know what a Sophist is; and 
<A NAME="162"></A>if not, then you do not even know to whom you are committing your soul 
<A NAME="163"></A>and whether the thing to which you commit yourself be good or 
<A NAME="164"></A>evil.
<A NAME="165"></A><BR><BR>I certainly think that I do know, he replied.
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>Then tell me, what do you imagine that he is?
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>I take him to be one who knows wise things, he replied, as his name 
<A NAME="168"></A>implies.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>And might you not, I said, affirm this of the painter and of the 
<A NAME="170"></A>carpenter also: Do not they, too, know wise things? But suppose a person 
<A NAME="171"></A>were to ask us: In what are the painters wise? We should answer: In what 
<A NAME="172"></A>relates to the making of likenesses, and similarly of other things. And 
<A NAME="173"></A>if he were further to ask: What is the wisdom of the Sophist, and what 
<A NAME="174"></A>is the manufacture over which he presides?-how should we answer 
<A NAME="175"></A>him?
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR>How should we answer him, Socrates? What other answer could there 
<A NAME="177"></A>be but that he presides over the art which makes men 
<A NAME="178"></A>eloquent?
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I replied, that is very likely true, but not enough; for in 
<A NAME="180"></A>the answer a further question is involved: Of what does the Sophist make 
<A NAME="181"></A>a man talk eloquently? The player on the lyre may be supposed to make a 
<A NAME="182"></A>man talk eloquently about that which he makes him understand, that is about 
<A NAME="183"></A>playing the lyre. Is not that true?
<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>Then about what does the Sophist make him eloquent? Must not he make 
<A NAME="186"></A>him eloquent in that which he understands?
<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR>Yes, that may be assumed.
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>And what is that which the Sophist knows and makes his disciple 
<A NAME="189"></A>know?
<A NAME="190"></A><BR><BR>Indeed, he said, I cannot tell.
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>Then I proceeded to say: Well, but are you aware of the danger which 
<A NAME="192"></A>you are incurring? If you were going to commit your body to some one, who 
<A NAME="193"></A>might do good or harm to it, would you not carefully consider and ask the 
<A NAME="194"></A>opinion of your friends and kindred, and deliberate many days as to whether 
<A NAME="195"></A>you should give him the care of your body? But when the soul is in question, 
<A NAME="196"></A>which you hold to be of far more value than the body, and upon the good 
<A NAME="197"></A>or evil of which depends the well-being of your all,-about this never consulted 
<A NAME="198"></A>either with your father or with your brother or with any one of us who 
<A NAME="199"></A>are your companions. But no sooner does this foreigner appear, than you 
<A NAME="200"></A>instantly commit your soul to his keeping. In the evening, as you say, 
<A NAME="201"></A>you hear of him, and in the morning you go to him, never deliberating or 
<A NAME="202"></A>taking the opinion of any one as to whether you ought to intrust yourself 
<A NAME="203"></A>to him or not;-you have quite made up your mind that you will at all hazards 
<A NAME="204"></A>be a pupil of Protagoras, and are prepared to expend all the property of 
<A NAME="205"></A>yourself and of your friends in carrying out at any price this determination, 
<A NAME="206"></A>although, as you admit, you do not know him, and have never spoken with 
<A NAME="207"></A>him: and you call him a Sophist, but are manifestly ignorant of what a 
<A NAME="208"></A>Sophist is; and yet you are going to commit yourself to his 
<A NAME="209"></A>keeping.
<A NAME="210"></A><BR><BR>When he heard me say this, he replied: No other inference, Socrates, 
<A NAME="211"></A>can be drawn from your words.
<A NAME="212"></A><BR><BR>I proceeded: Is not a Sophist, Hippocrates, one who deals wholesale 
<A NAME="213"></A>or retail in the food of the soul? To me that appears to be his 
<A NAME="214"></A>nature.
<A NAME="215"></A><BR><BR>And what, Socrates, is the food of the soul?
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>Surely, I said, knowledge is the food of the soul; and we must take 
<A NAME="217"></A>care, my friend, that the Sophist does not deceive us when he praises what 
<A NAME="218"></A>he sells, like the dealers wholesale or retail who sell the food of the 
<A NAME="219"></A>body; for they praise indiscriminately all their goods, without knowing 
<A NAME="220"></A>what are really beneficial or hurtful: neither do their customers know, 
<A NAME="221"></A>with the exception of any trainer or physician who may happen to buy of 
<A NAME="222"></A>them. In like manner those who carry about the wares of knowledge, and 
<A NAME="223"></A>make the round of the cities, and sell or retail them to any customer who 
<A NAME="224"></A>is in want of them, praise them all alike; though I should not wonder, 
<A NAME="225"></A>O my friend, if many of them were really ignorant of their effect upon 
<A NAME="226"></A>the soul; and their customers equally ignorant, unless he who buys of them 
<A NAME="227"></A>happens to be a physician of the soul. If, therefore, you have understanding 
<A NAME="228"></A>of what is good and evil, you may safely buy knowledge of Protagoras or 
<A NAME="229"></A>of any one; but if not, then, O my friend, pause, and do not hazard your 
<A NAME="230"></A>dearest interests at a game of chance. For there is far greater peril in 
<A NAME="231"></A>buying knowledge than in buying meat and drink: the one you purchase of 
<A NAME="232"></A>the wholesale or retail dealer, and carry them away in other vessels, and 
<A NAME="233"></A>before you receive them into the body as food, you may deposit them at 
<A NAME="234"></A>home and call in any experienced friend who knows what is good to be eaten 
<A NAME="235"></A>or drunken, and what not, and how much, and when; and then the danger of 
<A NAME="236"></A>purchasing them is not so great. But you cannot buy the wares of knowledge 
<A NAME="237"></A>and carry them away in another vessel; when you have paid for them you 
<A NAME="238"></A>must receive them into the soul and go your way, either greatly harmed 
<A NAME="239"></A>or greatly benefited; and therefore we should deliberate and take counsel 
<A NAME="240"></A>with our elders; for we are still young-too young to determine such a matter. 
<A NAME="241"></A>And now let us go, as we were intending, and hear Protagoras; and when 
<A NAME="242"></A>we have heard what he has to say, we may take counsel of others; for not 
<A NAME="243"></A>only is Protagoras at the house of Callias, but there is Hippias of Elis, 
<A NAME="244"></A>and, if I am not mistaken, Prodicus of Ceos, and several other wise 
<A NAME="245"></A>men.
<A NAME="246"></A><BR><BR>To this we agreed, and proceeded on our way until we reached the 
<A NAME="247"></A>vestibule of the house; and there we stopped in order to conclude a discussion 
<A NAME="248"></A>which had arisen between us as we were going along; and we stood talking 
<A NAME="249"></A>in the vestibule until we had finished and come to an understanding. And 
<A NAME="250"></A>I think that the doorkeeper, who was a eunuch, and who was probably annoyed 
<A NAME="251"></A>at the great inroad of the Sophists, must have heard us talking. At any 
<A NAME="252"></A>rate, when we knocked at the door, and he opened and saw us, he grumbled: 
<A NAME="253"></A>They are Sophists -he is not at home; and instantly gave the door a hearty 
<A NAME="254"></A>bang with both his hands. Again we knocked, and he answered without opening: 
<A NAME="255"></A>Did you not hear me say that he is not at home, fellows? But, my friend, 
<A NAME="256"></A>I said, you need not be alarmed; for we are not Sophists, and we are not 
<A NAME="257"></A>come to see Callias, but we want to see Protagoras; and I must request 
<A NAME="258"></A>you to announce us. At last, after a good deal of difficulty, the man was 
<A NAME="259"></A>persuaded to open the door.
<A NAME="260"></A><BR><BR>When we entered, we found Protagoras taking a walk in the cloister; 
<A NAME="261"></A>and next to him, on one side, were walking Callias, the son of Hipponicus, 
<A NAME="262"></A>and Paralus, the son of Pericles, who, by the mother's side, is his half-brother, 
<A NAME="263"></A>and Charmides, the son of Glaucon. On the other side of him were Xanthippus, 
<A NAME="264"></A>the other son of Pericles, Philippides, the son of Philomelus; also Antimoerus 
<A NAME="265"></A>of Mende, who of all the disciples of Protagoras is the most famous, and 
<A NAME="266"></A>intends to make sophistry his profession. A train of listeners followed 
<A NAME="267"></A>him; the greater part of them appeared to be foreigners, whom Protagoras 
<A NAME="268"></A>had brought with him out of the various cities visited by him in his journeys, 
<A NAME="269"></A>he, like Orpheus, attracting them his voice, and they following. I should 
<A NAME="270"></A>mention also that there were some Athenians in the company. Nothing delighted 
<A NAME="271"></A>me more than the precision of their movements: they never got into his 
<A NAME="272"></A>way at all; but when he and those who were with him turned back, then the 
<A NAME="273"></A>band of listeners parted regularly on either side; he was always in front, 
<A NAME="274"></A>and they wheeled round and took their places behind him in perfect 
<A NAME="275"></A>order.
<A NAME="276"></A><BR><BR>After him, as Homer says, "I lifted up my eyes and saw" Hippias 
<A NAME="277"></A>the Elean sitting in the opposite cloister on a chair of state, and around 
<A NAME="278"></A>him were seated on benches Eryximachus, the son of Acumenus, and Phaedrus 
<A NAME="279"></A>the Myrrhinusian, and Andron the son of Androtion, and there were strangers 
<A NAME="280"></A>whom he had brought with him from his native city of Elis, and some others: 
<A NAME="281"></A>they were putting to Hippias certain physical and astronomical questions, 
<A NAME="282"></A>and he, ex cathedra, was determining their several questions to them, and 
<A NAME="283"></A>discoursing of them.
<A NAME="284"></A><BR><BR>Also, "my eyes beheld Tantalus"; for Prodicus the Cean was at Athens: 
<A NAME="285"></A>he had been lodged in a room which, in the days of Hipponicus, was a storehouse; 
<A NAME="286"></A>but, as the house was full, Callias had cleared this out and made the room 
<A NAME="287"></A>into a guest-chamber. Now Prodicus was still in bed, wrapped up in sheepskins 
<A NAME="288"></A>and bed-clothes, of which there seemed to be a great heap; and there was 
<A NAME="289"></A>sitting by him on the couches near, Pausanias of the deme of Cerameis, 
<A NAME="290"></A>and with Pausanias was a youth quite young, who is certainly remarkable 
<A NAME="291"></A>for his good looks, and, if I am not mistaken, is also of a fair and gentle 
<A NAME="292"></A>nature. I thought that I heard him called Agathon, and my suspicion is 
<A NAME="293"></A>that he is the beloved of Pausanias. There was this youth, and also there 
<A NAME="294"></A>were the two Adeimantuses, one the son of Cepis, and the other of Leucolophides, 
<A NAME="295"></A>and some others. I was very anxious to hear what Prodicus was saying, for 
<A NAME="296"></A>he seems to me to be an all-wise and inspired man; but I was not able to 
<A NAME="297"></A>get into the inner circle, and his fine deep voice made an echo in the 
<A NAME="298"></A>room which rendered his words inaudible.
<A NAME="299"></A><BR><BR>No sooner had we entered than there followed us Alcibiades the 
<A NAME="300"></A>beautiful, as you say, and I believe you; and also Critias the son of 
<A NAME="301"></A>Callaeschrus.
<A NAME="302"></A><BR><BR>On entering we stopped a little, in order to look about us, and 
<A NAME="303"></A>then walked up to Protagoras, and I said: Protagoras, my friend Hippocrates 
<A NAME="304"></A>and I have come to see you.
<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR>Do you wish, he said, to speak with me alone, or in the presence 
<A NAME="306"></A>of the company?
<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR>Whichever you please, I said; you shall determine when you have 
<A NAME="308"></A>heard the purpose of our visit.
<A NAME="309"></A><BR><BR>And what is your purpose? he said.
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>I must explain, I said, that my friend Hippocrates is a native Athenian; 
<A NAME="311"></A>he is the son of Apollodorus, and of a great and prosperous house, and 
<A NAME="312"></A>he is himself in natural ability quite a match for anybody of his own age. 
<A NAME="313"></A>I believe that he aspires to political eminence; and this he thinks that 
<A NAME="314"></A>conversation with you is most likely to procure for him. And now you can 
<A NAME="315"></A>determine whether you would wish to speak to him of your teaching alone 
<A NAME="316"></A>or in the presence of the company.
<A NAME="317"></A><BR><BR>Thank you, Socrates, for your consideration of me. For certainly 
<A NAME="318"></A>a stranger finding his way into great cities, and persuading the flower 
<A NAME="319"></A>of the youth in them to leave company of their kinsmen or any other acquaintances, 
<A NAME="320"></A>old or young, and live with him, under the idea that they will be improved 
<A NAME="321"></A>by his conversation, ought to be very cautious; great jealousies are aroused 
<A NAME="322"></A>by his proceedings, and he is the subject of many enmities and conspiracies. 
<A NAME="323"></A>Now the art of the Sophist is, as I believe, of great antiquity; but in 
<A NAME="324"></A>ancient times those who practised it, fearing this odium, veiled and disguised 
<A NAME="325"></A>themselves under various names, some under that of poets, as Homer, Hesiod, 
<A NAME="326"></A>and Simonides, some, of hierophants and prophets, as Orpheus and Musaeus, 
<A NAME="327"></A>and some, as I observe, even under the name of gymnastic-masters, like 
<A NAME="328"></A>Iccus of Tarentum, or the more recently celebrated Herodicus, now of Selymbria 
<A NAME="329"></A>and formerly of Megara, who is a first-rate Sophist. Your own Agathocles 
<A NAME="330"></A>pretended to be a musician, but was really an eminent Sophist; also Pythocleides 
<A NAME="331"></A>the Cean; and there were many others; and all of them, as I was saying, 
<A NAME="332"></A>adopted these arts as veils or disguises because they were afraid of the 
<A NAME="333"></A>odium which they would incur. But that is not my way, for I do not believe 
<A NAME="334"></A>that they effected their purpose, which was to deceive the government, 
<A NAME="335"></A>who were not blinded by them; and as to the people, they have no understanding, 
<A NAME="336"></A>and only repeat what their rulers are pleased to tell them. Now to run 
<A NAME="337"></A>away, and to be caught in running away, is the very height of folly, and 
<A NAME="338"></A>also greatly increases the exasperation of mankind; for they regard him 
<A NAME="339"></A>who runs away as a rogue, in addition to any other objections which they 
<A NAME="340"></A>have to him; and therefore I take an entirely opposite course, and acknowledge 
<A NAME="341"></A>myself to be a Sophist and instructor of mankind; such an open acknowledgement 
<A NAME="342"></A>appears to me to be a better sort of caution than concealment. Nor do I 
<A NAME="343"></A>neglect other precautions, and therefore I hope, as I may say, by the favour 
<A NAME="344"></A>of heaven that no harm will come of the acknowledgment that I am a Sophist. 
<A NAME="345"></A>And I have been now many years in the profession-for all my years when 
<A NAME="346"></A>added up are many: there is no one here present of whom I might not be 
<A NAME="347"></A>the father. Wherefore I should much prefer conversing with you, if you 
<A NAME="348"></A>want to speak with me, in the presence of the company.
<A NAME="349"></A><BR><BR>As I suspected that he would like to have a little display and 
<A NAME="350"></A>glorification in the presence of Prodicus and Hippias, and would gladly 
<A NAME="351"></A>show us to them in the light of his admirers, I said: But why should we 
<A NAME="352"></A>not summon Prodicus and Hippias and their friends to hear 
<A NAME="353"></A>us?
<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR>Very good, he said.
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>Suppose, said Callias, that we hold a council in which you may sit 
<A NAME="356"></A>and discuss.-This was agreed upon, and great delight was felt at the prospect 
<A NAME="357"></A>of hearing wise men talk; we ourselves took the chairs and benches, and 
<A NAME="358"></A>arranged them by Hippias, where the other benches had been already placed. 
<A NAME="359"></A>Meanwhile Callias and Alcibiades got Prodicus out of bed and brought in 
<A NAME="360"></A>him and his companions.
<A NAME="361"></A><BR><BR>When we were all seated, Protagoras said: Now that the company 
<A NAME="362"></A>are assembled, Socrates, tell me about the youngman of whom you were just 
<A NAME="363"></A>now speaking.
<A NAME="364"></A><BR><BR>I replied: I will begin again at the same point, Protagoras, and 
<A NAME="365"></A>tell you once more the purport of my visit: this is my friend Hippocrates, 
<A NAME="366"></A>who is desirous of making your acquaintance; he would like to know what 
<A NAME="367"></A>will happen to him if he associates with you. I have no more to 
<A NAME="368"></A>say.
<A NAME="369"></A><BR><BR>Protagoras answered: Young man, if you associate with me, on the 
<A NAME="370"></A>very first day you will return home a better man than you came, and better 
<A NAME="371"></A>on the second day than on the first, and better every day than you were 
<A NAME="372"></A>on the day before.
<A NAME="373"></A><BR><BR>When I heard this, I said: Protagoras, I do not at all wonder at 
<A NAME="374"></A>hearing you say this; even at your age, and with all your wisdom, if any 
<A NAME="375"></A>one were to teach you what you did not know before, you would become better 
<A NAME="376"></A>no doubt: but please to answer in a different way-I will explain how by 
<A NAME="377"></A>an example. Let me suppose that Hippocrates, instead of desiring your acquaintance, 
<A NAME="378"></A>wished to become acquainted with the young man Zeuxippus of Heraclea, who 
<A NAME="379"></A>has lately been in Athens, and he had come to him as he has come to you, 
<A NAME="380"></A>and had heard him say, as he has heard you say, that every day he would 
<A NAME="381"></A>grow and become better if he associated with him: and then suppose that 
<A NAME="382"></A>he were to ask him, "In what shall I become better, and in what shall I 
<A NAME="383"></A>grow?"-Zeuxippus would answer, "In painting." And suppose that he went 
<A NAME="384"></A>to Orthagoras the Theban, and heard him say the same thing, and asked him, 
<A NAME="385"></A>"In what shall I become better day by day?" he would reply, "In flute-playing." 
<A NAME="386"></A>Now I want you to make the same sort of answer to this young man and to 
<A NAME="387"></A>me, who am asking questions on his account. When you say that on the first 
<A NAME="388"></A>day on which he associates with you he will return home a better man, and 
<A NAME="389"></A>on every day will grow in like manner,-In what, Protagoras, will he be 
<A NAME="390"></A>better? and about what?
<A NAME="391"></A><BR><BR>When Protagoras heard me say this, he replied: You ask questions 
<A NAME="392"></A>fairly, and I like to answer a question which is fairly put. If Hippocrates 
<A NAME="393"></A>comes to me he will not experience the sort of drudgery with which other 
<A NAME="394"></A>Sophists are in the habit of insulting their pupils; who, when they have 
<A NAME="395"></A>just escaped from the arts, are taken and driven back into them by these 
<A NAME="396"></A>teachers, and made to learn calculation, and astronomy, and geometry, and 
<A NAME="397"></A>music (he gave a look at Hippias as he said this); but if he comes to me, 
<A NAME="398"></A>he will learn that which he comes to learn. And this is prudence in affairs 
<A NAME="399"></A>private as well as public; he will learn to order his own house in the 
<A NAME="400"></A>best manner, and he will be able to speak and act for the best in the affairs 
<A NAME="401"></A>of the state.
<A NAME="402"></A><BR><BR>Do I understand you, I said; and is your meaning that you teach 
<A NAME="403"></A>the art of politics, and that you promise to make men good 
<A NAME="404"></A>citizens?
<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR>That, Socrates, is exactly the profession which I 
<A NAME="406"></A>make.
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>Then, I said, you do indeed possess a noble art, if there is no mistake 
<A NAME="408"></A>about this; for I will freely confess to you, Protagoras, that I have a 
<A NAME="409"></A>doubt whether this art is capable of being taught, and yet I know not how 
<A NAME="410"></A>to disbelieve your assertion. And I ought to tell you why I am of opinion 
<A NAME="411"></A>that this art cannot be taught or communicated by man to man. I say that 
<A NAME="412"></A>the Athenians are an understanding people, and indeed they are esteemed 
<A NAME="413"></A>to be such by the other Hellenes. Now I observe that when we are met together 
<A NAME="414"></A>in the assembly, and the matter in hand relates to building, the builders 
<A NAME="415"></A>are summoned as advisers; when the question is one of shipbuilding, then 
<A NAME="416"></A>the ship-wrights; and the like of other arts which they think capable of 
<A NAME="417"></A>being taught and learned. And if some person offers to give them advice 
<A NAME="418"></A>who is not supposed by them to have any skill in the art, even though he 
<A NAME="419"></A>be good-looking, and rich, and noble, they will not listen to him, but 
<A NAME="420"></A>laugh and hoot at him, until either he is clamoured down and retires of 
<A NAME="421"></A>himself; or if he persist, he is dragged away or put out by the constables 
<A NAME="422"></A>at the command of the prytanes. This is their way of behaving about professors 
<A NAME="423"></A>of the arts. But when the question is an affair of state, then everybody 
<A NAME="424"></A>is free to have a say-carpenter, tinker, cobbler, sailor, passenger; rich 
<A NAME="425"></A>and poor, high and low-any one who likes gets up, and no one reproaches 
<A NAME="426"></A>him, as in the former case, with not having learned, and having no teacher, 
<A NAME="427"></A>and yet giving advice; evidently because they are under the impression 
<A NAME="428"></A>that this sort of knowledge cannot be taught. And not only is this true 
<A NAME="429"></A>of the state, but of individuals; the best and wisest of our citizens are 
<A NAME="430"></A>unable to impart their political wisdom to others: as for example, Pericles, 
<A NAME="431"></A>the father of these young men, who gave them excellent instruction in all 
<A NAME="432"></A>that could be learned from masters, in his own department of politics neither 
<A NAME="433"></A>taught them, nor gave them teachers; but they were allowed to wander at 
<A NAME="434"></A>their own free will in a sort of hope that they would light upon virtue 
<A NAME="435"></A>of their own accord. Or take another example: there was Cleinias the younger 
<A NAME="436"></A>brother of our friend Alcibiades, of whom this very same Pericles was the 
<A NAME="437"></A>guardian; and he being in fact under the apprehension that Cleinias would 
<A NAME="438"></A>be corrupted by Alcibiades, took him away, and placed him in the house 
<A NAME="439"></A>of Ariphron to be educated; but before six months had elapsed, Ariphron 
<A NAME="440"></A>sent him back, not knowing what to do with him. And I could mention numberless 
<A NAME="441"></A>other instances of persons who were good themselves, and never yet made 
<A NAME="442"></A>any one else good, whether friend or stranger. Now I, Protagoras, having 
<A NAME="443"></A>these examples before me, am inclined to think that virtue cannot be taught. 
<A NAME="444"></A>But then again, when I listen to your words, I waver; and am disposed to 
<A NAME="445"></A>think that there must be something in what you say, because I know that 
<A NAME="446"></A>you have great experience, and learning, and invention. And I wish that 
<A NAME="447"></A>you would, if possible, show me a little more clearly that virtue can be 
<A NAME="448"></A>taught. Will you be so good?
<A NAME="449"></A><BR><BR>That I will, Socrates, and gladly. But what would you like? Shall 
<A NAME="450"></A>I, as an elder, speak to you as younger men in an apologue or myth, or 
<A NAME="451"></A>shall I argue out the question?
<A NAME="452"></A><BR><BR>To this several of the company answered that he should choose for 
<A NAME="453"></A>himself.
<A NAME="454"></A><BR><BR>Well, then, he said, I think that the myth will be more 
<A NAME="455"></A>interesting.
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>Once upon a time there were gods only, and no mortal creatures. But 
<A NAME="457"></A>when the time came that these also should be created, the gods fashioned 
<A NAME="458"></A>them out of earth and fire and various mixtures of both elements in the 
<A NAME="459"></A>interior of the earth; and when they were about to bring them into the 
<A NAME="460"></A>light of day, they ordered Prometheus and Epimetheus to equip them, and 
<A NAME="461"></A>to distribute to them severally their proper qualities. Epimetheus said 
<A NAME="462"></A>to Prometheus: "Let me distribute, and do you inspect." This was agreed, 
<A NAME="463"></A>and Epimetheus made the distribution. There were some to whom he gave strength 
<A NAME="464"></A>without swiftness, while he equipped the weaker with swiftness; some he 
<A NAME="465"></A>armed, and others he left unarmed; and devised for the latter some other 
<A NAME="466"></A>means of preservation, making some large, and having their size as a protection, 
<A NAME="467"></A>and others small, whose nature was to fly in the air or burrow in the ground; 
<A NAME="468"></A>this was to be their way of escape. Thus did he compensate them with the 
<A NAME="469"></A>view of preventing any race from becoming extinct. And when he had provided 
<A NAME="470"></A>against their destruction by one another, he contrived also a means of 
<A NAME="471"></A>protecting them against the seasons of heaven; clothing them with close 
<A NAME="472"></A>hair and thick skins sufficient to defend them against the winter cold 
<A NAME="473"></A>and able to resist the summer heat, so that they might have a natural bed 
<A NAME="474"></A>of their own when they wanted to rest; also he furnished them with hoofs 
<A NAME="475"></A>and hair and hard and callous skins under their feet. Then he gave them 
<A NAME="476"></A>varieties of food-herb of the soil to some, to others fruits of trees, 
<A NAME="477"></A>and to others roots, and to some again he gave other animals as food. And 
<A NAME="478"></A>some he made to have few young ones, while those who were their prey were 
<A NAME="479"></A>very prolific; and in this manner the race was preserved. Thus did Epimetheus, 
<A NAME="480"></A>who, not being very wise, forgot that he had distributed among the brute 
<A NAME="481"></A>animals all the qualities which he had to give-and when he came to man, 
<A NAME="482"></A>who was still unprovided, he was terribly perplexed. Now while he was in 
<A NAME="483"></A>this perplexity, Prometheus came to inspect the distribution, and he found 
<A NAME="484"></A>that the other animals were suitably furnished, but that man alone was 
<A NAME="485"></A>naked and shoeless, and had neither bed nor arms of defence. The appointed 
<A NAME="486"></A>hour was approaching when man in his turn was to go forth into the light 
<A NAME="487"></A>of day; and Prometheus, not knowing how he could devise his salvation, 
<A NAME="488"></A>stole the mechanical arts of Hephaestus and Athene, and fire with them 
<A NAME="489"></A>(they could neither have been acquired nor used without fire), and gave 
<A NAME="490"></A>them to man. Thus man had the wisdom necessary to the support of life, 
<A NAME="491"></A>but political wisdom he had not; for that was in the keeping of Zeus, and 
<A NAME="492"></A>the power of Prometheus did not extend to entering into the citadel of 
<A NAME="493"></A>heaven, where Zeus dwelt, who moreover had terrible sentinels; but he did 
<A NAME="494"></A>enter by stealth into the common workshop of Athene and Hephaestus, in 
<A NAME="495"></A>which they used to practise their favourite arts, and carried off Hephaestus' 
<A NAME="496"></A>art of working by fire, and also the art of Athene, and gave them to man. 
<A NAME="497"></A>And in this way man was supplied with the means of life. But Prometheus 
<A NAME="498"></A>is said to have been afterwards prosecuted for theft, owing to the blunder 
<A NAME="499"></A>of Epimetheus.
<A NAME="500"></A><BR><BR>Now man, having a share of the divine attributes, was at first 
<A NAME="501"></A>the only one of the animals who had any gods, because he alone was of their 
<A NAME="502"></A>kindred; and he would raise altars and images of them. He was not long 
<A NAME="503"></A>in inventing articulate speech and names; and he also constructed houses 
<A NAME="504"></A>and clothes and shoes and beds, and drew sustenance from the earth. Thus 
<A NAME="505"></A>provided, mankind at first lived dispersed, and there were no cities. But 
<A NAME="506"></A>the consequence was that they were destroyed by the wild beasts, for they 
<A NAME="507"></A>were utterly weak in comparison of them, and their art was only sufficient 
<A NAME="508"></A>to provide them with the means of life, and did not enable them to carry 
<A NAME="509"></A>on war against the animals: food they had, but not as yet the art of government, 
<A NAME="510"></A>of which the art of war is a part. After a while the desire of self-preservation 
<A NAME="511"></A>gathered them into cities; but when they were gathered together, having 
<A NAME="512"></A>no art of government, they evil intreated one another, and were again in 
<A NAME="513"></A>process of dispersion and destruction. Zeus feared that the entire race 
<A NAME="514"></A>would be exterminated, and so he sent Hermes to them, bearing reverence 
<A NAME="515"></A>and justice to be the ordering principles of cities and the bonds of friendship 
<A NAME="516"></A>and conciliation. Hermes asked Zeus how he should impart justice and reverence 
<A NAME="517"></A>among men:-Should he distribute them as the arts are distributed; that 
<A NAME="518"></A>is to say, to a favoured few only, one skilled individual having enough 
<A NAME="519"></A>of medicine or of any other art for many unskilled ones? "Shall this be 
<A NAME="520"></A>the manner in which I am to distribute justice and reverence among men, 
<A NAME="521"></A>or shall I give them to all?" "To all," said Zeus; "I should like them 
<A NAME="522"></A>all to have a share; for cities cannot exist, if a few only share in the 
<A NAME="523"></A>virtues, as in the arts. And further, make a law by my order, that he who 
<A NAME="524"></A>has no part in reverence and justice shall be put to death, for he is a 
<A NAME="525"></A>plague of the state."
<A NAME="526"></A><BR><BR>And this is the reason, Socrates, why the Athenians and mankind 
<A NAME="527"></A>in general, when the question relates to carpentering or any other mechanical 
<A NAME="528"></A>art, allow but a few to share in their deliberations; and when any one 
<A NAME="529"></A>else interferes, then, as you say, they object, if he be not of the favoured 
<A NAME="530"></A>few; which, as I reply, is very natural. But when they meet to deliberate 
<A NAME="531"></A>about political virtue, which proceeds only by way of justice and wisdom, 
<A NAME="532"></A>they are patient enough of any man who speaks of them, as is also natural, 
<A NAME="533"></A>because they think that every man ought to share in this sort of virtue, 
<A NAME="534"></A>and that states could not exist if this were otherwise. I have explained 
<A NAME="535"></A>to you, Socrates, the reason of this phenomenon.
<A NAME="536"></A><BR><BR>And that you may not suppose yourself to be deceived in thinking 
<A NAME="537"></A>that all men regard every man as having a share of justice or honesty and 
<A NAME="538"></A>of every other political virtue, let me give you a further proof, which 
<A NAME="539"></A>is this. In other cases, as you are aware, if a man says that he is a good 
<A NAME="540"></A>flute-player, or skilful in any other art in which he has no skill, people 
<A NAME="541"></A>either laugh at him or are angry with him, and his relations think that 
<A NAME="542"></A>he is mad and go and admonish him; but when honesty is in question, or 
<A NAME="543"></A>some other political virtue, even if they know that he is dishonest, yet, 
<A NAME="544"></A>if the man comes publicly forward and tells the truth about his dishonesty, 
<A NAME="545"></A>then, what in the other case was held by them to be good sense, they now 
<A NAME="546"></A>deem to be madness. They say that all men ought to profess honesty whether 
<A NAME="547"></A>they are honest or not, and that a man is out of his mind who says anything 
<A NAME="548"></A>else. Their notion is, that a man must have some degree of honesty; and 
<A NAME="549"></A>that if he has none at all he ought not to be in the 
<A NAME="550"></A>world.
<A NAME="551"></A><BR><BR>I have been showing that they are right in admitting every man 
<A NAME="552"></A>as a counsellor about this sort of virtue, as they are of opinion that 
<A NAME="553"></A>every man is a partaker of it. And I will now endeavour to show further 
<A NAME="554"></A>that they do not conceive this virtue to be given by nature, or to grow 
<A NAME="555"></A>spontaneously, but to be a thing which may be taught; and which comes to 
<A NAME="556"></A>a man by taking pains. No one would instruct, no one would rebuke, or be 
<A NAME="557"></A>angry with those whose calamities they suppose to be due to nature or chance; 
<A NAME="558"></A>they do not try to punish or to prevent them from being what they are; 
<A NAME="559"></A>they do but pity them. Who is so foolish as to chastise or instruct the 
<A NAME="560"></A>ugly, or the diminutive, or the feeble? And for this reason. Because he 
<A NAME="561"></A>knows that good and evil of this kind is the work of nature and of chance; 
<A NAME="562"></A>whereas if a man is wanting in those good qualities which are attained 
<A NAME="563"></A>by study and exercise and teaching, and has only the contrary evil qualities, 
<A NAME="564"></A>other men are angry with him, and punish and reprove him-of these evil 
<A NAME="565"></A>qualities one is impiety, another injustice, and they may be described 
<A NAME="566"></A>generally as the very opposite of political virtue. In such cases any man 
<A NAME="567"></A>will be angry with another, and reprimand him,-clearly because he thinks 
<A NAME="568"></A>that by study and learning, the virtue in which the other is deficient 
<A NAME="569"></A>may be acquired. If you will think, Socrates, of the nature of punishment, 
<A NAME="570"></A>you will see at once that in the opinion of mankind virtue may be acquired; 
<A NAME="571"></A>no one punishes the evil-doer under the notion, or for the reason, that 
<A NAME="572"></A>he has done wrong, only the unreasonable fury of a beast acts in that manner. 
<A NAME="573"></A>But he who desires to inflict rational punishment does not retaliate for 
<A NAME="574"></A>a past wrong which cannot be undone; he has regard to the future, and is 
<A NAME="575"></A>desirous that the man who is punished, and he who sees him punished, may 
<A NAME="576"></A>be deterred from doing wrong again. He punishes for the sake of prevention, 
<A NAME="577"></A>thereby clearly implying that virtue is capable of being taught. This is 
<A NAME="578"></A>the notion of all who retaliate upon others either privately or publicly. 
<A NAME="579"></A>And the Athenians, too, your own citizens, like other men, punish and take 
<A NAME="580"></A>vengeance on all whom they regard as evil doers; and hence, we may infer 
<A NAME="581"></A>them to be of the number of those who think that virtue may be acquired 
<A NAME="582"></A>and taught. Thus far, Socrates, I have shown you clearly enough, if I am 
<A NAME="583"></A>not mistaken, that your countrymen are right in admitting the tinker and 
<A NAME="584"></A>the cobbler to advise about politics, and also that they deem virtue to 
<A NAME="585"></A>be capable of being taught and acquired.
<A NAME="586"></A><BR><BR>There yet remains one difficulty which has been raised by you about 
<A NAME="587"></A>the sons of good men. What is the reason why good men teach their sons 
<A NAME="588"></A>the knowledge which is gained from teachers, and make them wise in that, 
<A NAME="589"></A>but do nothing towards improving them in the virtues which distinguish 
<A NAME="590"></A>themselves? And here, Socrates, I will leave the apologue and resume the 
<A NAME="591"></A>argument. Please to consider: Is there or is there not some one quality 
<A NAME="592"></A>of which all the citizens must be partakers, if there is to be a city at 
<A NAME="593"></A>all? In the answer to this question is contained the only solution of your 
<A NAME="594"></A>difficulty; there is no other. For if there be any such quality, and this 
<A NAME="595"></A>quality or unity is not the art of the carpenter, or the smith, or the 
<A NAME="596"></A>potter, but justice and temperance and holiness and, in a word, manly virtue-if 
<A NAME="597"></A>this is the quality of which all men must be partakers, and which is the 
<A NAME="598"></A>very condition of their learning or doing anything else, and if he who 
<A NAME="599"></A>is wanting in this, whether he be a child only or a grown-up man or woman, 
<A NAME="600"></A>must be taught and punished, until by punishment he becomes better, and 
<A NAME="601"></A>he who rebels against instruction and punishment is either exiled or condemned 
<A NAME="602"></A>to death under the idea that he is incurable-if what I am saying be true, 
<A NAME="603"></A>good men have their sons taught other things and not this, do consider 
<A NAME="604"></A>how extraordinary their conduct would appear to be. For we have shown that 
<A NAME="605"></A>they think virtue capable of being taught and cultivated both in private 
<A NAME="606"></A>and public; and, notwithstanding, they have their sons taught lesser matters, 
<A NAME="607"></A>ignorance of which does not involve the punishment of death: but greater 
<A NAME="608"></A>things, of which the ignorance may cause death and exile to those who have 
<A NAME="609"></A>no training or knowledge of them-aye, and confiscation as well as death, 
<A NAME="610"></A>and, in a word, may be the ruin of families-those things, I say, they are 
<A NAME="611"></A>supposed not to teach them-not to take the utmost care that they should 
<A NAME="612"></A>learn. How improbable is this, Socrates!
<A NAME="613"></A><BR><BR>Education and admonition commence in the first years of childhood, 
<A NAME="614"></A>and last to the very end of life. Mother and nurse and father and tutor 
<A NAME="615"></A>are vying with one another about the improvement of the child as soon as 
<A NAME="616"></A>ever he is able to understand what is being said to him: he cannot say 
<A NAME="617"></A>or do anything without their setting forth to him that this is just and 
<A NAME="618"></A>that is unjust; this is honourable, that is dishonourable; this is holy, 
<A NAME="619"></A>that is unholy; do this and abstain from that. And if he obeys, well and 
<A NAME="620"></A>good; if not, he is straightened by threats and blows, like a piece of 
<A NAME="621"></A>bent or warped wood. At a later stage they send him to teachers, and enjoin 
<A NAME="622"></A>them to see to his manners even more than to his reading and music; and 
<A NAME="623"></A>the teachers do as they are desired. And when the boy has learned his letters 
<A NAME="624"></A>and is beginning to understand what is written, as before he understood 
<A NAME="625"></A>only what was spoken, they put into his hands the works of great poets, 
<A NAME="626"></A>which he reads sitting on a bench at school; in these are contained many 
<A NAME="627"></A>admonitions, and many tales, and praises, and encomia of ancient famous 
<A NAME="628"></A>men, which he is required to learn by heart, in order that he may imitate 
<A NAME="629"></A>or emulate them and desire to become like them. Then, again, the teachers 
<A NAME="630"></A>of the lyre take similar care that their young disciple is temperate and 
<A NAME="631"></A>gets into no mischief; and when they have taught him the use of the lyre, 
<A NAME="632"></A>they introduce him to the poems of other excellent poets, who are the lyric 
<A NAME="633"></A>poets; and these they set to music, and make their harmonies ana rhythms 
<A NAME="634"></A>quite familiar to the children's souls, in order that they may learn to 
<A NAME="635"></A>be more gentle, and harmonious, and rhythmical, and so more fitted for 
<A NAME="636"></A>speech and action; for the life of man in every part has need of harmony 
<A NAME="637"></A>and rhythm. Then they send them to the master of gymnastic, in order that 
<A NAME="638"></A>their bodies may better minister to the virtuous mind, and that they may 
<A NAME="639"></A>not be compelled through bodily weakness to play the coward in war or on 
<A NAME="640"></A>any other occasion. This is what is done by those who have the means, and 
<A NAME="641"></A>those who have the means are the rich; their children begin to go to school 
<A NAME="642"></A>soonest and leave off latest. When they have done with masters, the state 
<A NAME="643"></A>again compels them to learn the laws, and live after the pattern which 
<A NAME="644"></A>they furnish, and not after their own fancies; and just as in learning 
<A NAME="645"></A>to write, the writing-master first draws lines with a style for the use 
<A NAME="646"></A>of the young beginner, and gives him the tablet and makes him follow the 
<A NAME="647"></A>lines, so the city draws the laws, which were the invention of good lawgivers 
<A NAME="648"></A>living in the olden time; these are given to the young man, in order to 
<A NAME="649"></A>guide him in his conduct whether he is commanding or obeying; and he who 
<A NAME="650"></A>transgresses them is to be corrected, or, in other words, called to account, 
<A NAME="651"></A>which is a term used not only in your country, but also in many others, 
<A NAME="652"></A>seeing that justice calls men to account. Now when there is all this care 
<A NAME="653"></A>about virtue private and public, why, Socrates, do you still wonder and 
<A NAME="654"></A>doubt whether virtue can be taught? Cease to wonder, for the opposite would 
<A NAME="655"></A>be far more surprising.
<A NAME="656"></A><BR><BR>But why then do the sons of good fathers often turn out ill? There 
<A NAME="657"></A>is nothing very wonderful in this; for, as I have been saying, the existence 
<A NAME="658"></A>of a state implies that virtue is not any man's private possession. If 
<A NAME="659"></A>so-and nothing can be truer-then I will further ask you to imagine, as 
<A NAME="660"></A>an illustration, some other pursuit or branch of knowledge which may be 
<A NAME="661"></A>assumed equally to be the condition of the existence of a state. Suppose 
<A NAME="662"></A>that there could be no state unless we were all flute-players, as far as 
<A NAME="663"></A>each had the capacity, and everybody was freely teaching everybody the 
<A NAME="664"></A>art, both in private and public, and reproving the bad player as freely 
<A NAME="665"></A>and openly as every man now teaches justice and the laws, not concealing 
<A NAME="666"></A>them as he would conceal the other arts, but imparting them-for all of 
<A NAME="667"></A>us have a mutual interest in the justice and virtue of one another, and 
<A NAME="668"></A>this is the reason why every one is so ready to teach justice and the laws;-suppose, 
<A NAME="669"></A>I say, that there were the same readiness and liberality among us in teaching 
<A NAME="670"></A>one another flute-playing, do you imagine, Socrates, that the sons of good 
<A NAME="671"></A>flute players would be more likely to be good than the sons of bad ones? 
<A NAME="672"></A>I think not. Would not their sons grow up to be distinguished or undistinguished 
<A NAME="673"></A>according to their own natural capacities as flute-players, and the son 
<A NAME="674"></A>of a good player would often turn out to be a bad one, and the son of a 
<A NAME="675"></A>bad player to be a good one, all flute-players would be good enough in 
<A NAME="676"></A>comparison of those who were ignorant and unacquainted with the art of 
<A NAME="677"></A>flute-playing? In like manner I would have you consider that he who appears 
<A NAME="678"></A>to you to be the worst of those who have been brought up in laws and humanities, 
<A NAME="679"></A>would appear to be a just man and a master of justice if he were to be 
<A NAME="680"></A>compared with men who had no education, or courts of justice, or laws, 
<A NAME="681"></A>or any restraints upon them which compelled them to practise virtue-with 
<A NAME="682"></A>the savages, for example, whom the poet Pherecrates exhibited on the stage 
<A NAME="683"></A>at the last year's Lenaean festival. If you were living among men such 
<A NAME="684"></A>as the man-haters in his Chorus, you would be only too glad to meet with 
<A NAME="685"></A>Eurybates and Phrynondas, and you would sorrowfully long to revisit the 
<A NAME="686"></A>rascality of this part of the world. you, Socrates, are discontented, and 
<A NAME="687"></A>why? Because all men are teachers of virtue, each one according to his 
<A NAME="688"></A>ability; and you say, Where are the teachers? You might as well ask, Who 
<A NAME="689"></A>teaches Greek? For of that too there will not be any teachers found. Or 
<A NAME="690"></A>you might ask, Who is to teach the sons of our artisans this same art which 
<A NAME="691"></A>they have learned of their fathers? He and his fellow-workmen have taught 
<A NAME="692"></A>them to the best of their ability,-but who will carry them further in their 
<A NAME="693"></A>arts? And you would certainly have a difficulty, Socrates, in finding a 
<A NAME="694"></A>teacher of them; but there would be no difficulty in finding a teacher 
<A NAME="695"></A>of those who are wholly ignorant. And this is true of virtue or of anything 
<A NAME="696"></A>else; if a man is better able than we are to promote virtue ever so little, 
<A NAME="697"></A>we must be content with the result. A teacher of this sort I believe myself 
<A NAME="698"></A>to be, and above all other men to have the knowledge which makes a man 
<A NAME="699"></A>noble and good; and I give my pupils their money's-worth, and even more, 
<A NAME="700"></A>as they themselves confess. And therefore I have introduced the following 
<A NAME="701"></A>mode of payment:-When a man has been my pupil, if he likes he pays my price, 
<A NAME="702"></A>but there is no compulsion; and if he does not like, he has only to go 
<A NAME="703"></A>into a temple and take an oath of the value of the instructions, and he 
<A NAME="704"></A>pays no more than he declares to be their value.
<A NAME="705"></A><BR><BR>Such is my Apologue, Socrates, and such is the argument by which 
<A NAME="706"></A>I endeavour to show that virtue may be taught, and that this is the opinion 
<A NAME="707"></A>of the Athenians. And I have also attempted to show that you are not to 
<A NAME="708"></A>wonder at good fathers having bad sons, or at good sons having bad fathers, 
<A NAME="709"></A>of which the sons of Polycleitus afford an example, who are the companions 
<A NAME="710"></A>of our friends here, Paralus and Xanthippus, but are nothing in comparison 
<A NAME="711"></A>with their father; and this is true of the sons of many other artists. 
<A NAME="712"></A>As yet I ought not to say the same of Paralus and Xanthippus themselves, 
<A NAME="713"></A>for they are young and there is still hope of them.
<A NAME="714"></A><BR><BR>Protagoras ended, and in my ear
<A NAME="715"></A><BR><BR>So charming left his voice, that I the while
<A NAME="716"></A><BR>Thought him still speaking; still stood fixed to hear. At length, when 
<A NAME="717"></A>the truth dawned upon me, that he had really finished, not without difficulty 
<A NAME="718"></A>I began to collect myself, and looking at Hippocrates, I said to him: O 
<A NAME="719"></A>son of Apollodorus, how deeply grateful I am to you for having brought 
<A NAME="720"></A>me hither; I would not have missed the speech of Protagoras for a great 
<A NAME="721"></A>deal. For I used to imagine that no human care could make men good; but 
<A NAME="722"></A>I know better now. Yet I have still one very small difficulty which I am 
<A NAME="723"></A>sure that Protagoras will easily explain, as he has already explained so 
<A NAME="724"></A>much. If a man were to go and consult Pericles or any of our great speakers 
<A NAME="725"></A>about these matters, he might perhaps hear as fine a discourse; but then 
<A NAME="726"></A>when one has a question to ask of any of them, like books, they can neither 
<A NAME="727"></A>answer nor ask; and if any one challenges the least particular of their 
<A NAME="728"></A>speech, they go ringing on in a long harangue, like brazen pots, which 
<A NAME="729"></A>when they are struck continue to sound unless some one puts his hand upon 
<A NAME="730"></A>them; whereas our friend Protagoras can not only make a good speech, as 
<A NAME="731"></A>he has already shown, but when he is asked a question he can answer briefly; 
<A NAME="732"></A>and when he asks he will wait and hear the answer; and this is a very rare 
<A NAME="733"></A>gift. Now I, Protagoras, want to ask of you a little question, which if 
<A NAME="734"></A>you will only answer, I shall be quite satisfied. You were saying that 
<A NAME="735"></A>virtue can be taught;-that I will take upon your authority, and there is 
<A NAME="736"></A>no one to whom I am more ready to trust. But I marvel at one thing about 
<A NAME="737"></A>which I should like to have my mind set at rest. You were speaking of Zeus 
<A NAME="738"></A>sending justice and reverence to men; and several times while you were 
<A NAME="739"></A>speaking, justice, and temperance, and holiness, and all these qualities, 
<A NAME="740"></A>were described by you as if together they made up virtue. Now I want you 
<A NAME="741"></A>to tell me truly whether virtue is one whole, of which justice and temperance 
<A NAME="742"></A>and holiness are parts; or whether all these are only the names of one 
<A NAME="743"></A>and the same thing: that is the doubt which still lingers in my 
<A NAME="744"></A>mind.
<A NAME="745"></A><BR><BR>There is no difficulty, Socrates, in answering that the qualities 
<A NAME="746"></A>of which you are speaking are the parts of virtue which is 
<A NAME="747"></A>one.
<A NAME="748"></A><BR><BR>And are they parts, I said, in the same sense in which mouth, nose, 
<A NAME="749"></A>and eyes, and ears, are the parts of a face; or are they like the parts 
<A NAME="750"></A>of gold, which differ from the whole and from one another only in being 
<A NAME="751"></A>larger or smaller?
<A NAME="752"></A><BR><BR>I should say that they differed, Socrates, in the first way; they 
<A NAME="753"></A>are related to one another as the parts of a face are related to the whole 
<A NAME="754"></A>face.
<A NAME="755"></A><BR><BR>And do men have some one part and some another part of virtue? 
<A NAME="756"></A>Of if a man has one part, must he also have all the 
<A NAME="757"></A>others?
<A NAME="758"></A><BR><BR>By no means, he said; for many a man is brave and not just, or 
<A NAME="759"></A>just and not wise.
<A NAME="760"></A><BR><BR>You would not deny, then, that courage and wisdom are also parts 
<A NAME="761"></A>of virtue?
<A NAME="762"></A><BR><BR>Most undoubtedly they are, he answered; and wisdom is the noblest 
<A NAME="763"></A>of the parts.
<A NAME="764"></A><BR><BR>And they are all different from one another? I 
<A NAME="765"></A>said.
<A NAME="766"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>And has each of them a distinct function like the parts of the face;-the 
<A NAME="768"></A>eye, for example, is not like the ear, and has not the same functions; 
<A NAME="769"></A>and the other parts are none of them like one another, either in their 
<A NAME="770"></A>functions, or in any other way? I want to know whether the comparison holds 
<A NAME="771"></A>concerning the parts of virtue. Do they also differ from one another in 
<A NAME="772"></A>themselves and in their functions? For that is clearly what the simile 
<A NAME="773"></A>would imply.
<A NAME="774"></A><BR><BR>Yes, Socrates, you are right in supposing that they 
<A NAME="775"></A>differ.
<A NAME="776"></A><BR>Then, I said, no other part of virtue is like knowledge, or like justice, 
<A NAME="777"></A>or like courage, or like temperance, or like holiness?
<A NAME="778"></A><BR><BR>No, he answered.
<A NAME="779"></A><BR>Well then, I said, suppose that you and I enquire into their natures. 
<A NAME="780"></A>And first, you would agree with me that justice is of the nature of a thing, 
<A NAME="781"></A>would you not? That is my opinion: would it not be yours 
<A NAME="782"></A>also?
<A NAME="783"></A><BR><BR>Mine also, he said.
<A NAME="784"></A><BR>And suppose that some one were to ask us, saying, "O Protagoras, and 
<A NAME="785"></A>you, Socrates, what about this thing which you were calling justice, is 
<A NAME="786"></A>it just or unjust?"-and I were to answer, just: would you vote with me 
<A NAME="787"></A>or against me?
<A NAME="788"></A><BR><BR>With you, he said.
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>Thereupon I should answer to him who asked me, that justice is of the 
<A NAME="790"></A>nature of the just: would not you?
<A NAME="791"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said.
<A NAME="792"></A><BR>And suppose that he went on to say: "Well now, is there also such a 
<A NAME="793"></A>thing as holiness? "we should answer, "Yes," if I am not 
<A NAME="794"></A>mistaken?
<A NAME="795"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said.
<A NAME="796"></A><BR>Which you would also acknowledge to be a thing-should we not say 
<A NAME="797"></A>so?
<A NAME="798"></A><BR>He assented.
<A NAME="799"></A><BR>"And is this a sort of thing which is of the nature of the holy, or 
<A NAME="800"></A>of the nature of the unholy?" I should be angry at his putting such a question, 
<A NAME="801"></A>and should say, "Peace, man; nothing can be holy if holiness is not holy." 
<A NAME="802"></A>What would you say? Would you not answer in the same 
<A NAME="803"></A>way?
<A NAME="804"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he said.
<A NAME="805"></A><BR>And then after this suppose that he came and asked us, "What were you 
<A NAME="806"></A>saying just now? Perhaps I may not have heard you rightly, but you seemed 
<A NAME="807"></A>to me to be saying that the parts of virtue were not the same as one another." 
<A NAME="808"></A>I should reply, "You certainly heard that said, but not, as you imagine, 
<A NAME="809"></A>by me; for I only asked the question; Protagoras gave the answer." And 
<A NAME="810"></A>suppose that he turned to you and said, "Is this true, Protagoras? and 
<A NAME="811"></A>do you maintain that one part of virtue is unlike another, and is this 
<A NAME="812"></A>your position?"-how would you answer him?
<A NAME="813"></A><BR><BR>I could not help acknowledging the truth of what he said, 
<A NAME="814"></A>Socrates.
<A NAME="815"></A><BR>Well then, Protagoras, we will assume this; and now supposing that 
<A NAME="816"></A>he proceeded to say further, "Then holiness is not of the nature of justice, 
<A NAME="817"></A>nor justice of the nature of holiness, but of the nature of unholiness; 
<A NAME="818"></A>and holiness is of the nature of the not just, and therefore of the unjust, 
<A NAME="819"></A>and the unjust is the unholy": how shall we answer him? I should certainly 
<A NAME="820"></A>answer him on my own behalf that justice is holy, and that holiness is 
<A NAME="821"></A>just; and I would say in like manner on your behalf also, if you would 
<A NAME="822"></A>allow me, that justice is either the same with holiness, or very nearly 
<A NAME="823"></A>the same; and above all I would assert that justice is like holiness and 
<A NAME="824"></A>holiness is like justice; and I wish that you would tell me whether I may 
<A NAME="825"></A>be permitted to give this answer on your behalf, and whether you would 
<A NAME="826"></A>agree with me.
<A NAME="827"></A><BR><BR>He replied, I cannot simply agree, Socrates, to the proposition 
<A NAME="828"></A>that justice is holy and that holiness is just, for there appears to me 
<A NAME="829"></A>to be a difference between them. But what matter? if you please I please; 
<A NAME="830"></A>and let us assume, if you will I, that justice is holy, and that holiness 
<A NAME="831"></A>is just.
<A NAME="832"></A><BR><BR>Pardon me, I replied; I do not want this "if you wish" or "if you 
<A NAME="833"></A>will" sort of conclusion to be proven, but I want you and me to be proven: 
<A NAME="834"></A>I mean to say that the conclusion will be best proven if there be no 
<A NAME="835"></A>"if."
<A NAME="836"></A><BR><BR>Well, he said, I admit that justice bears a resemblance to holiness, 
<A NAME="837"></A>for there is always some point of view in which everything is like every 
<A NAME="838"></A>other thing; white is in a certain way like black, and hard is like soft, 
<A NAME="839"></A>and the most extreme opposites have some qualities in common; even the 
<A NAME="840"></A>parts of the face which, as we were saying before, are distinct and have 
<A NAME="841"></A>different functions, are still in a certain point of view similar, and 
<A NAME="842"></A>one of them is like another of them. And you may prove that they are like 
<A NAME="843"></A>one another on the same principle that all things are like one another; 
<A NAME="844"></A>and yet things which are like in some particular ought not to be called 
<A NAME="845"></A>alike, nor things which are unlike in some particular, however slight, 
<A NAME="846"></A>unlike.
<A NAME="847"></A><BR><BR>And do you think, I said in a tone of surprise, that justice and 
<A NAME="848"></A>holiness have but a small degree of likeness?
<A NAME="849"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not; any more than I agree with what I understand to 
<A NAME="850"></A>be your view.
<A NAME="851"></A><BR><BR>Well, I said, as you appear to have a difficulty about this, let 
<A NAME="852"></A>us take another of the examples which you mentioned instead. Do you admit 
<A NAME="853"></A>the existence of folly?
<A NAME="854"></A><BR><BR>I do.
<A NAME="855"></A><BR>And is not wisdom the. very opposite of folly?
<A NAME="856"></A><BR>That is true, he said.
<A NAME="857"></A><BR>And when men act rightly and advantageously they seem to you to be 
<A NAME="858"></A>temperate?
<A NAME="859"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said.
<A NAME="860"></A><BR>And temperance makes them temperate?
<A NAME="861"></A><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="862"></A><BR>And they who do not act rightly act foolishly, and in acting thus are 
<A NAME="863"></A>not temperate?
<A NAME="864"></A><BR><BR>I agree, he said.
<A NAME="865"></A><BR>Then to act foolishly is the opposite of acting 
<A NAME="866"></A>temperately?
<A NAME="867"></A><BR>He assented.
<A NAME="868"></A><BR>And foolish actions are done by folly, and temperate actions by 
<A NAME="869"></A>temperance?
<A NAME="870"></A><BR><BR>He agreed.
<A NAME="871"></A><BR>And that is done strongly which is done by strength, and that which 
<A NAME="872"></A>is weakly done, by weakness?
<A NAME="873"></A><BR><BR>He assented.
<A NAME="874"></A><BR>And that which is done with swiftness is done swiftly, and that which 
<A NAME="875"></A>is done with slowness, slowly?
<A NAME="876"></A><BR><BR>He assented again.
<A NAME="877"></A><BR>And that which is done in the same manner, is done by the same; and 
<A NAME="878"></A>that which is done in an opposite manner by the opposite?
<A NAME="879"></A><BR><BR>He agreed.
<A NAME="880"></A><BR>Once more, I said, is there anything beautiful?
<A NAME="881"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="882"></A><BR>To which the only opposite is the ugly?
<A NAME="883"></A><BR>There is no other.
<A NAME="884"></A><BR>And is there anything good?
<A NAME="885"></A><BR>There is.
<A NAME="886"></A><BR>To which the only opposite is the evil?
<A NAME="887"></A><BR>There is no other.
<A NAME="888"></A><BR>And there is the acute in sound?
<A NAME="889"></A><BR>True.
<A NAME="890"></A><BR>To which the only opposite is the grave?
<A NAME="891"></A><BR>There is no other, he said, but that.
<A NAME="892"></A><BR>Then every opposite has one opposite only and no 
<A NAME="893"></A>more?
<A NAME="894"></A><BR>He assented.
<A NAME="895"></A><BR>Then now, I said, let us recapitulate our admissions. First of all 
<A NAME="896"></A>we admitted that everything has one opposite and not more than 
<A NAME="897"></A>one?
<A NAME="898"></A><BR><BR>We did so.
<A NAME="899"></A><BR>And we admitted also that what was done in opposite ways was done by 
<A NAME="900"></A>opposites?
<A NAME="901"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="902"></A><BR>And that which was done foolishly, as we further admitted, was done 
<A NAME="903"></A>in the opposite way to that which was done temperately?
<A NAME="904"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="905"></A><BR>And that which was done temperately was done by temperance, and that 
<A NAME="906"></A>which was done foolishly by folly?
<A NAME="907"></A><BR><BR>He agreed.
<A NAME="908"></A><BR>And that which is done in opposite ways is done by 
<A NAME="909"></A>opposites?
<A NAME="910"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="911"></A><BR>And one thing is done by temperance, and quite another thing by 
<A NAME="912"></A>folly?
<A NAME="913"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="914"></A><BR>And in opposite ways?
<A NAME="915"></A><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="916"></A><BR>And therefore by opposites:-then folly is the opposite of 
<A NAME="917"></A>temperance?
<A NAME="918"></A><BR><BR>Clearly.
<A NAME="919"></A><BR>And do you remember that folly has already been acknowledged by us 
<A NAME="920"></A>to be the opposite of wisdom?
<A NAME="921"></A><BR><BR>He assented.
<A NAME="922"></A><BR>And we said that everything has only one opposite?
<A NAME="923"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="924"></A><BR>Then, Protagoras, which of the two assertions shall we renounce? One 
<A NAME="925"></A>says that everything has but one opposite; the other that wisdom is distinct 
<A NAME="926"></A>from temperance, and that both of them are parts of virtue; and that they 
<A NAME="927"></A>are not only distinct, but dissimilar, both in themselves and in their 
<A NAME="928"></A>functions, like the parts of a face. Which of these two assertions shall 
<A NAME="929"></A>we renounce? For both of them together are certainly not in harmony; they 
<A NAME="930"></A>do not accord or agree: for how can they be said to agree if everything 
<A NAME="931"></A>is assumed to have only one opposite and not more than one, and yet folly, 
<A NAME="932"></A>which is one, has clearly the two opposites wisdom and temperance? Is not 
<A NAME="933"></A>that true, Protagoras? What else would you say?
<A NAME="934"></A><BR><BR>He assented, but with great reluctance.
<A NAME="935"></A><BR>Then temperance and wisdom are the same, as before justice and holiness 
<A NAME="936"></A>appeared to us to be nearly the same. And now, Protagoras, I said, we must 
<A NAME="937"></A>finish the enquiry, and not faint. Do you think that an unjust man can 
<A NAME="938"></A>be temperate in his injustice?
<A NAME="939"></A><BR><BR>I should be ashamed, Socrates, he said, to acknowledge this which 
<A NAME="940"></A>nevertheless many may be found to assert.
<A NAME="941"></A><BR><BR>And shall I argue with them or with you? I replied.
<A NAME="942"></A><BR>I would rather, he said, that you should argue with the many first, 
<A NAME="943"></A>if you will.
<A NAME="944"></A><BR><BR>Whichever you please, if you will only answer me and say whether 
<A NAME="945"></A>you are of their opinion or not. My object is to test the validity of the 
<A NAME="946"></A>argument; and yet the result may be that I who ask and you who answer may 
<A NAME="947"></A>both be put on our trial.
<A NAME="948"></A><BR><BR>Protagoras at first made a show of refusing, as he said that the 
<A NAME="949"></A>argument was not encouraging; at length, he consented to 
<A NAME="950"></A>answer.
<A NAME="951"></A><BR><BR>Now then, I said, begin at the beginning and answer me. You think 
<A NAME="952"></A>that some men are temperate, and yet unjust?
<A NAME="953"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said; let that be admitted.
<A NAME="954"></A><BR>And temperance is good sense?
<A NAME="955"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="956"></A><BR>And good sense is good counsel in doing injustice?
<A NAME="957"></A><BR>Granted.
<A NAME="958"></A><BR>If they succeed, I said, or if they do not succeed?
<A NAME="959"></A><BR>If they succeed.
<A NAME="960"></A><BR>And you would admit the existence of goods?
<A NAME="961"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="962"></A><BR>And is the good that which is expedient for man?
<A NAME="963"></A><BR>Yes, indeed, he said: and there are some things which may be inexpedient, 
<A NAME="964"></A>and yet I call them good.
<A NAME="965"></A><BR><BR>I thought that Protagoras was getting ruffled and excited; he seemed 
<A NAME="966"></A>to be setting himself in an attitude of war. Seeing this, I minded my business, 
<A NAME="967"></A>and gently said:-
<A NAME="968"></A><BR><BR>When you say, Protagoras, that things inexpedient are good, do 
<A NAME="969"></A>you mean inexpedient for man only, or inexpedient altogether? and do you 
<A NAME="970"></A>call the latter good?
<A NAME="971"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not the last, he replied; for I know of many things-meats, 
<A NAME="972"></A>drinks, medicines, and ten thousand other things, which are inexpedient 
<A NAME="973"></A>for man, and some which are expedient; and some which are neither expedient 
<A NAME="974"></A>nor inexpedient for man, but only for horses; and some for oxen only, and 
<A NAME="975"></A>some for dogs; and some for no animals, but only for trees; and some for 
<A NAME="976"></A>the roots of trees and not for their branches, as for example, manure, 
<A NAME="977"></A>which is a good thing when laid about the roots of a tree, but utterly 
<A NAME="978"></A>destructive if thrown upon the shoots and young branches; or I may instance 
<A NAME="979"></A>olive oil, which is mischievous to all plants, and generally most injurious 
<A NAME="980"></A>to the hair of every animal with the exception of man, but beneficial to 
<A NAME="981"></A>human hair and to the human body generally; and even in this application 
<A NAME="982"></A>(so various and changeable is the nature of the benefit), that which is 
<A NAME="983"></A>the greatest good to the outward parts of a man, is a very great evil to 
<A NAME="984"></A>his inward parts: and for this reason physicians always forbid their patients 
<A NAME="985"></A>the use of oil in their food, except in very small quantities, just enough 
<A NAME="986"></A>to extinguish the disagreeable sensation of smell in meats and 
<A NAME="987"></A>sauces.
<A NAME="988"></A><BR><BR>When he had given this answer, the company cheered him. And I said: 
<A NAME="989"></A>Protagoras, I have a wretched memory, and when any one makes a long speech 
<A NAME="990"></A>to me I never remember what he is talking about. As then, if I had been 
<A NAME="991"></A>deaf, and you were going to converse with me, you would have had to raise 
<A NAME="992"></A>your voice; so now, having such a bad memory, I will ask you to cut your 
<A NAME="993"></A>answers shorter, if you would take me with you.
<A NAME="994"></A><BR><BR>What do you mean? he said: how am I to shorten my answers? shall 
<A NAME="995"></A>I make them too short?
<A NAME="996"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not, I said.
<A NAME="997"></A><BR>But short enough?
<A NAME="998"></A><BR>Yes, I said.
<A NAME="999"></A><BR>Shall I answer what appears to me to be short enough, or what appears 
<A NAME="1000"></A>to you to be short enough?
<A NAME="1001"></A><BR><BR>I have heard, I said, that you can speak and teach others to speak 
<A NAME="1002"></A>about the same things at such length that words never seemed to fail, or 
<A NAME="1003"></A>with such brevity that no one could use fewer of them. Please therefore, 
<A NAME="1004"></A>if you talk with me, to adopt the latter or more compendious 
<A NAME="1005"></A>method.
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR><BR>Socrates, he replied, many a battle of words have I fought, and 
<A NAME="1007"></A>if I had followed the method of disputation which my adversaries desired, 
<A NAME="1008"></A>as you want me to do, I should have been no better than another, and the 
<A NAME="1009"></A>name of Protagoras would have been nowhere.
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR><BR>I saw that he was not satisfied with his previous answers, and 
<A NAME="1011"></A>that he would not play the part of answerer any more if he could help; 
<A NAME="1012"></A>and I considered that there was no call upon me to continue the conversation; 
<A NAME="1013"></A>so I said: Protagoras, I do not wish to force the conversation upon you 
<A NAME="1014"></A>if you had rather not, but when you are willing to argue with me in such 
<A NAME="1015"></A>a way that I can follow you, then I will argue with you. Now you, as is 
<A NAME="1016"></A>said of you by others and as you say of yourself, are able to have discussions 
<A NAME="1017"></A>in shorter forms of speech as well as in longer, for you are a master of 
<A NAME="1018"></A>wisdom; but I cannot manage these long speeches: I only wish that I could. 
<A NAME="1019"></A>You, on the other hand, who are capable of either, ought to speak shorter 
<A NAME="1020"></A>as I beg you, and then we might converse. But I see that you are disinclined, 
<A NAME="1021"></A>and as I have an engagement which will prevent my staying to hear you at 
<A NAME="1022"></A>greater length (for I have to be in another place), I will depart; although 
<A NAME="1023"></A>I should have liked to have heard you.
<A NAME="1024"></A><BR><BR>Thus I spoke, and was rising from my seat, when Callias seized 
<A NAME="1025"></A>me by the right hand, and in his left hand caught hold of this old cloak 
<A NAME="1026"></A>of mine. He said: We cannot let you go, Socrates, for if you leave us there 
<A NAME="1027"></A>will be an end of our discussions: I must therefore beg you to remain, 
<A NAME="1028"></A>as there is nothing in the world that I should like better than to hear 
<A NAME="1029"></A>you and Protagoras discourse. Do not deny the company this 
<A NAME="1030"></A>pleasure.
<A NAME="1031"></A><BR><BR>Now I had got up, and was in the act of departure. Son of Hipponicus, 
<A NAME="1032"></A>I replied, I have always admired, and do now heartily applaud and love 
<A NAME="1033"></A>your philosophical spirit, and I would gladly comply with your request, 
<A NAME="1034"></A>if I could. But the truth is that I cannot. And what you ask is as great 
<A NAME="1035"></A>an impossibility to me, as if you bade me run a race with Crison of Himera, 
<A NAME="1036"></A>when in his prime, or with some one of the long or day course runners. 
<A NAME="1037"></A>To such a request I should reply that I would fain ask the same of my own 
<A NAME="1038"></A>legs; but they refuse to comply. And therefore if you want to see Crison 
<A NAME="1039"></A>and me in the same stadium, you must bid him slacken his speed to mine, 
<A NAME="1040"></A>for I cannot run quickly, and he can run slowly. And in like manner if 
<A NAME="1041"></A>you want to hear me and Protagoras discoursing, you must ask him to shorten 
<A NAME="1042"></A>his answers, and keep to the point, as he did at first; if not, how can 
<A NAME="1043"></A>there be any discussion? For discussion is one thing, and making an oration 
<A NAME="1044"></A>is quite another, in my humble opinion.
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR><BR>But you see, Socrates, said Callias, that Protagoras may fairly 
<A NAME="1046"></A>claim to speak in his own way, just as you claim to speak in 
<A NAME="1047"></A>yours.
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR><BR>Here Alcibiades interposed, and said: That, Callias, is not a true 
<A NAME="1049"></A>statement of the case. For our friend Socrates admits that he cannot make 
<A NAME="1050"></A>a speech-in this he yields the palm to Protagoras: but I should be greatly 
<A NAME="1051"></A>surprised if he yielded to any living man in the power of holding and apprehending 
<A NAME="1052"></A>an argument. Now if Protagoras will make a similar admission, and confess 
<A NAME="1053"></A>that he is inferior to Socrates in argumentative skill, that is enough 
<A NAME="1054"></A>for Socrates; but if he claims a superiority in argument as well, let him 
<A NAME="1055"></A>ask and answer-not, when a question is asked, slipping away from the point, 
<A NAME="1056"></A>and instead of answering, making a speech at such length that most of his 
<A NAME="1057"></A>hearers forget the question at issue (not that Socrates is likely to forget-I 
<A NAME="1058"></A>will be bound for that, although he may pretend in fun that he has a bad 
<A NAME="1059"></A>memory). And Socrates appears to me to be more in the right than Protagoras; 
<A NAME="1060"></A>that is my view, and every man ought to say what he 
<A NAME="1061"></A>thinks.
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR><BR>When Alcibiades had done speaking, some one-Critias, I believe-went 
<A NAME="1063"></A>on to say: O Prodicus and Hippias, Callias appears to me to be a partisan 
<A NAME="1064"></A>of Protagoras: and this led Alcibiades, who loves opposition, to take the 
<A NAME="1065"></A>other side. But we should not be partisans either of Socrates or of Protagoras; 
<A NAME="1066"></A>let us rather unite in entreating both of them not to break up the 
<A NAME="1067"></A>discussion.
<A NAME="1068"></A><BR><BR>Prodicus added: That, Critias, seems to me to be well said, for 
<A NAME="1069"></A>those who are present at such discussions ought to be impartial hearers 
<A NAME="1070"></A>of both the speakers; remembering, however, that impartiality is not the 
<A NAME="1071"></A>same as equality, for both sides should be impartially heard, and yet an 
<A NAME="1072"></A>equal meed should not be assigned to both of them; but to the wiser a higher 
<A NAME="1073"></A>meed should be given, and a lower to the less wise. And I as well as Critias 
<A NAME="1074"></A>would beg you, Protagoras and Socrates, to grant our request, which is, 
<A NAME="1075"></A>that you will argue with one another and not wrangle; for friends argue 
<A NAME="1076"></A>with friends out of goodwill, but only adversaries and enemies wrangle. 
<A NAME="1077"></A>And then our meeting will be delightful; for in this way you, who are the 
<A NAME="1078"></A>speakers, will be most likely to win esteem, and not praise only, among 
<A NAME="1079"></A>us who are your audience; for esteem is a sincere conviction of the hearers' 
<A NAME="1080"></A>souls, but praise is often an insincere expression of men uttering falsehoods 
<A NAME="1081"></A>contrary to their conviction. And thus we who are the hearers will be gratified 
<A NAME="1082"></A>and not pleased; for gratification is of the mind when receiving wisdom 
<A NAME="1083"></A>and knowledge, but pleasure is of the body when eating or experiencing 
<A NAME="1084"></A>some other bodily delight. Thus spoke Prodicus, and many of the company 
<A NAME="1085"></A>applauded his words.
<A NAME="1086"></A><BR><BR>Hippias the sage spoke next. He said: All of you who are here present 
<A NAME="1087"></A>I reckon to be kinsmen and friends and fellow-citizens, by nature and not 
<A NAME="1088"></A>by law; for by nature like is akin to like, whereas law is the tyrant of 
<A NAME="1089"></A>mankind, and often compels us to do many things which are against nature. 
<A NAME="1090"></A>How great would be the disgrace then, if we, who know the nature of things, 
<A NAME="1091"></A>and are the wisest of the Hellenes, and as such are met together in this 
<A NAME="1092"></A>city, which is the metropolis of wisdom, and in the greatest and most glorious 
<A NAME="1093"></A>house of this city, should have nothing to show worthy of this height of 
<A NAME="1094"></A>dignity, but should only quarrel with one another like the meanest of mankind 
<A NAME="1095"></A>I pray and advise you, Protagoras, and you, Socrates, to agree upon a compromise. 
<A NAME="1096"></A>Let us be your peacemakers. And do not you, Socrates, aim at this precise 
<A NAME="1097"></A>and extreme brevity in discourse, if Protagoras objects, but loosen and 
<A NAME="1098"></A>let go the reins of speech, that your words may be grander and more becoming 
<A NAME="1099"></A>to you. Neither do you, Protagoras, go forth on the gale with every sail 
<A NAME="1100"></A>set out of sight of land into an ocean of words, but let there be a mean 
<A NAME="1101"></A>observed by both of you. Do as I say. And let me also persuade you to choose 
<A NAME="1102"></A>an arbiter or overseer or president; he will keep watch over your words 
<A NAME="1103"></A>and will prescribe their proper length.
<A NAME="1104"></A><BR><BR>This proposal was received by the company with universal approval; 
<A NAME="1105"></A>Callias said that he would not let me off, and they begged me to choose 
<A NAME="1106"></A>an arbiter. But I said that to choose an umpire of discourse would be unseemly; 
<A NAME="1107"></A>for if the person chosen was inferior, then the inferior or worse ought 
<A NAME="1108"></A>not to preside over the better; or if he was equal, neither would that 
<A NAME="1109"></A>be well; for he who is our equal will do as we do, and what will be the 
<A NAME="1110"></A>use of choosing him? And if you say, "Let us have a better then,"-to that 
<A NAME="1111"></A>I answer that you cannot have any one who is wiser than Protagoras. And 
<A NAME="1112"></A>if you choose another who is not really better, and whom you only say is 
<A NAME="1113"></A>better, to put another over him as though he were an inferior person would 
<A NAME="1114"></A>be an unworthy reflection on him; not that, as far as I am concerned, any 
<A NAME="1115"></A>reflection is of much consequence to me. Let me tell you then what I will 
<A NAME="1116"></A>do in order that the conversation and discussion may go on as you desire. 
<A NAME="1117"></A>If Protagoras is not disposed to answer, let him ask and I will answer; 
<A NAME="1118"></A>and I will endeavour to show at the same time how, as I maintain, he ought 
<A NAME="1119"></A>to answer: and when I have answered as many questions as he likes to ask, 
<A NAME="1120"></A>let him in like manner answer me; and if he seems to be not very ready 
<A NAME="1121"></A>at answering the precise question asked of him, you and I will unite in 
<A NAME="1122"></A>entreating him, as you entreated me, not to spoil the discussion. And this 
<A NAME="1123"></A>will require no special arbiter-all of you shall be 
<A NAME="1124"></A>arbiters.
<A NAME="1125"></A><BR><BR>This was generally approved, and Protagoras, though very much against 
<A NAME="1126"></A>his will, was obliged to agree that he would ask questions; and when he 
<A NAME="1127"></A>had put a sufficient number of them, that he would answer in his turn those 
<A NAME="1128"></A>which he was asked in short replies. He began to put his questions as 
<A NAME="1129"></A>follows:-
<A NAME="1130"></A><BR><BR>I am of opinion, Socrates, he said, that skill in poetry is the 
<A NAME="1131"></A>principal part of education; and this I conceive to be the power of knowing 
<A NAME="1132"></A>what compositions of the poets are correct, and what are not, and how they 
<A NAME="1133"></A>are to be distinguished, and of explaining when asked the reason of the 
<A NAME="1134"></A>difference. And I propose to transfer the question which you and I have 
<A NAME="1135"></A>been discussing to the domain of poetry; we will speak as before of virtue, 
<A NAME="1136"></A>but in reference to a passage of a poet. Now Simonides says to Scopas the 
<A NAME="1137"></A>son of Creon the Thessalian:
<A NAME="1138"></A><BR><BR>Hardly on the one hand can a man become truly good, built four-square 
<A NAME="1139"></A>in hands and feet and mind, a work without a flaw. Do you know the poem? 
<A NAME="1140"></A>or shall I repeat the whole?
<A NAME="1141"></A><BR><BR>There is no need, I said; for I am perfectly well acquainted with 
<A NAME="1142"></A>the ode-I have made a careful study of it.
<A NAME="1143"></A><BR><BR>Very well, he said. And do you think that the ode is a good composition, 
<A NAME="1144"></A>and true?
<A NAME="1145"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I said, both good and true.
<A NAME="1146"></A><BR>But if there is a contradiction, can the composition be good or 
<A NAME="1147"></A>true?
<A NAME="1148"></A><BR><BR>No, not in that case, I replied.
<A NAME="1149"></A><BR>And is there not a contradiction? he asked. Reflect.
<A NAME="1150"></A><BR>Well, my friend, I have reflected.
<A NAME="1151"></A><BR>And does not the poet proceed to say, "I do not agree with the word 
<A NAME="1152"></A>of Pittacus, albeit the utterance of a wise man: Hardly can a man be good"? 
<A NAME="1153"></A>Now you will observe that this is said by the same poet.
<A NAME="1154"></A><BR><BR>I know it.
<A NAME="1155"></A><BR>And do you think, he said, that the two sayings are 
<A NAME="1156"></A>consistent?
<A NAME="1157"></A><BR>Yes, I said, I think so (at the same time I could not help fearing 
<A NAME="1158"></A>that there might be something in what he said). And you think 
<A NAME="1159"></A>otherwise?
<A NAME="1160"></A><BR><BR>Why, he said, how can he be consistent in both? First of all, premising 
<A NAME="1161"></A>as his own thought, "Hardly can a man become truly good"; and then a little 
<A NAME="1162"></A>further on in the poem, forgetting, and blaming Pittacus and refusing to 
<A NAME="1163"></A>agree with him, when he says, "Hardly can a man be good," which is the 
<A NAME="1164"></A>very same thing. And yet when he blames him who says the same with himself, 
<A NAME="1165"></A>he blames himself; so that he must be wrong either in his first or his 
<A NAME="1166"></A>second assertion.
<A NAME="1167"></A><BR><BR>Many of the audience cheered and applauded this. And I felt at 
<A NAME="1168"></A>first giddy and faint, as if I had received a blow from the hand of an 
<A NAME="1169"></A>expert boxer, when I heard his words and the sound of the cheering; and 
<A NAME="1170"></A>to confess the truth, I wanted to get time to think what the meaning of 
<A NAME="1171"></A>the poet really was. So I turned to Prodicus and called him. Prodicus, 
<A NAME="1172"></A>I said, Simonides is a countryman of yours, and you ought to come to his 
<A NAME="1173"></A>aid. I must appeal to you, like the river Scamander in Homer, who, when 
<A NAME="1174"></A>beleaguered by Achilles, summons the Simois to aid him, 
<A NAME="1175"></A>saying:
<A NAME="1176"></A><BR><BR>Brother dear, let us both together stay the force of the hero. 
<A NAME="1177"></A>And I summon you, for I am afraid that Protagoras will make an end of Simonides. 
<A NAME="1178"></A>Now is the time to rehabilitate Simonides, by the application of your philosophy 
<A NAME="1179"></A>of synonyms, which enables you to distinguish "will" and "wish," and make 
<A NAME="1180"></A>other charming distinctions like those which you drew just now. And I should 
<A NAME="1181"></A>like to know whether you would agree with me; for I am of opinion that 
<A NAME="1182"></A>there is no contradiction in the words of Simonides. And first of all I 
<A NAME="1183"></A>wish that you would say whether, in your opinion, Prodicus, "being" is 
<A NAME="1184"></A>the same as "becoming."
<A NAME="1185"></A><BR><BR>Not the same, certainly, replied Prodicus.
<A NAME="1186"></A><BR>Did not Simonides first set forth, as his own view, that "Hardly can 
<A NAME="1187"></A>a man become truly good"?
<A NAME="1188"></A><BR><BR>Quite right, said Prodicus.
<A NAME="1189"></A><BR>And then he blames Pittacus, not, as Protagoras imagines, for repeating 
<A NAME="1190"></A>that which he says himself, but for saying something different from himself. 
<A NAME="1191"></A>Pittacus does not say as Simonides says, that hardly can a man become good, 
<A NAME="1192"></A>but hardly can a man be good: and our friend Prodicus would maintain that 
<A NAME="1193"></A>being, Protagoras, is not the same as becoming; and if they are not the 
<A NAME="1194"></A>same, then Simonides is not inconsistent with himself. I dare say that 
<A NAME="1195"></A>Prodicus and many others would say, as Hesiod says,
<A NAME="1196"></A><BR><BR>On the one hand, hardly can a man become good,
<A NAME="1197"></A><BR>For the gods have made virtue the reward of toil,
<A NAME="1198"></A><BR>But on the other hand, when you have climbed the 
<A NAME="1199"></A>height,
<A NAME="1200"></A><BR>Then, to retain virtue, however difficult the acquisition, is 
<A NAME="1201"></A>easy.
<A NAME="1202"></A><BR><BR>Prodicus heard and approved; but Protagoras said: Your correction, 
<A NAME="1203"></A>Socrates, involves a greater error than is contained in the sentence which 
<A NAME="1204"></A>you are correcting.
<A NAME="1205"></A><BR><BR>Alas! I s
